<h4 id="chapter-xii-vale-italia">CHAPTER XII Vale, Italia</h4>
<p>1760-89</p>
<p>I. FAREWELL TOUR</p>
<p>I F we indulge ourselves in one more look at Italy we shall find her,
even in this seeming siesta, warm with life: Turin nursing Alfieri,
Lucca</p>
<p>publishing Diderot’s Ency elope die, Florence flowering again under
Grand Duke Leopold, Milan reforming law with Beccaria, Pavia and Bologna
thrilling with the experiments of Volta and Galvani, Venice suffering
Casa- nova, Naples challenging the papacy, Rome caught in the tragedy of
the Jesuits, and a hundred breeding grounds of music exporting opera and
vir- tuosi to tame the savage transalpine breast. We shall meet in Italy
a hundred thousand foreigners coming to study her treasures and bask in
her sun. There, in this age, Goethe, choked with Weimar dignitaries,
came to renew his youth and discipline his Muse.</p>
<p>Goethe’s first impression, as he came down from the Alps into Venezi
a Tridentina (September, 1786), was of the mild and luminous air, which
“gave exquisite enjoyment to mere existence, even to poverty.” 1 And
next, the uncaged life: “the inhabitants are always out of doors, and,
in their lightheartedness, think of noth ing” but to live. He thought
that the fruitful soil must readily provide for the modest wants of
these simple people; yet the poverty, and the lack of sanitation in the
smaller towns, dismayed him.</p>
<p>When I asked the waiter for a certain place he pointed down into the
court- yard, “ qui abasso puo servire ” “Dove?” I asked. “Da per tutto ,
dove vuol” was the friendly reply…. Forecourts and colonnades are all
soiled with filth, for things are done in the most natural manner. 2</p>
<p>Sensory adaptation gradually reconciled him.</p>
<p>Venice was enjoying her amiable decay. About 1778 Carlo Gozzi de-
scribed with righteous exaggeration what seemed to him a general
dissolu- tion of morality:</p>
<p>The spectacle of women turned into men, men turned into women, and
both men and women turned into monkeys; all of them immersed… in the
whirli- gig of fashion; corrupting and seducing one another with the
eagerness of hounds on the scent, vying in their lusts and ruinous
extravagance,… burn- ing incense… to Priapus. 3</p>
<p>In 1797 he blamed the collapse on philosophy:</p>
<p>Religion, that salutary curb on human passion, has… become a
laughing- stock. I am bound to believe that the gallows benefit society,
being an instru-</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>3 1 1</p>
<p>ment for punishing crime and deterring would-be criminals. But our
new- fangled philosophers have denounced the gallows as a tyrannical
prejudice, and by so doing they have multiplied murders on the highway,
robberies and acts of violence, a hundredfold….</p>
<p>It was pronounced a musty and barbarous prejudice to keep women at
home for the supervision of their sons and daughters,… their domestic
service and economy. At once the women poured forth, storming like
Bacchanals* screaming, “Liberty! liberty !” The streets swarmed with
them…. Mean - while they abandoned their vapory brains to fashions,
frivolous inventions,</p>
<p>… amusements, amours, coquetries, and all sorts of nonsense…. The
hus- bands had not the courage to oppose this ruin of their honor, their
substance, their families. They were afraid of being pilloried with that
dreadful word prejudice…. Good morals, modesty, and chastity received
the name of prejudice…. When all the so-called prejudices had been put
to flight,… many great and remarkable blessings appeared:… irreligion,
respect and reverence annulled, justice overturned,… criminals
encouraged and bewept, heated imaginations, sharpened senses, animalism,
indulgence in all lusts and passions, imperious luxury,… bankruptcies,…
adulteries. 4</p>
<p>But of course the basic causes of decay were economic and military;
Venice no longer had the wealth to defend her former power. By contrast
her rival, Austria, had grown so strong in manpower that she commanded
all land approaches to the lagoons, and fought some of her campaigns on
the soil of the neutral but helpless republic.</p>
<p>On March 9, 1789, Lodovico Manin was elected to head the government —
the last of the 120 doges who had presided over Venice in an impressive
continuity since 697. He was a man of great riches and little character,
but poverty and courage would not have prevented his tragedy. Four
months later the Bastille fell; the religion of liberty captured the
imagination of France; and when the religion came with the legions of
Napoleon it swept nearly all Italy under its banner and ecstasy. On the
ground that Austrian forces had used Venetian territory, and on the
charge that Venice had secretly aided his enemies, the victorious
Corsican, backed by eighty thou- sand troops, imposed upon the Queen of
the Adriatic a provisional govern- ment dictated by himself (May 12,
1797). On that day Doge Manin, re- signing, gave his cap of state to an
attendant, and bade him “take it away; we shall not want it again.” 5 A
few days later he died. On May 16 French troops occupied the city. On
October 17 Bonaparte signed at Campoformio a treaty that transferred
Venice and nearly all her territorial possessions to Austria in exchange
for Austrian concessions to France in Belgium and on the left bank of
the Rhine. It was exactly eleven hundred years since the first doge had
been elected to rule and defend the lagoons.</p>
<p>Parma was a Spanish protectorate, but its Duke, Don Felipe, son of
Philip V and Isabella Farnese, married Louise Elisabeth, daughter of
Louis XV; he adopted her expensive habits, and made his court a
miniature Versailles. Parma became a center of culture, gaily mingling
cosmopolitan ways. “It seemed to me,” said Casanova, “that I was no
longer in Italy, for everything had the air of belonging to the other
side of the Alps. I heard only French</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>and Spanish spoken by the passers- by.” 6 An enlightened minister,
Guillaume du Tillot, gave the duchy stimulating reforms. Here were made
some of the finest textiles, crystals, and faience.</p>
<p>Milan now experienced an industrial expansion modestly prefiguring
its economic pre-eminence in the Italy of today. Austrian rule gave
loose rein to local ability and enterprise. Count Karl Joseph von
Firmian, governor of Lombardy, co-operated with native leaders in
improving administration, and reduced the oppressive power of feudal
barons and municipal oligarchs. A group of economic liberals led by
Pietro Verri, Cesare Bonesana di Bec- caria, and Giovanni Carli adopted
the principles of the physiocrats, abol- ished taxes on internal trade,
ended the farming of taxes, and spread the burden by taxing
ecclesiastical property. The textile industry grew till in 1785 it
comprised twenty-nine firms, operating 1,384 looms. The land was
surveyed, the state financed irrigation projects, the peasants worked
with a will. In the twenty-one years between 1749 and 1770 the
population of the duchy rose from 90,000 to 130,000/ It was in this
period of Milanese ex- hilaration that the community built the Teatro
alia Scala (1776-78), seating 3,600 spectators amid palatial
decorations, and offering facilities for music, conversation, eating,
playing cards, and sleeping; and, surmounting all, a reservoir of water
designed to extinguish any fire. Here Cimarosa and Cherubini now enjoyed
resounding victories.</p>
<p>This was the heroic age of Corsica. That mountainous isje was already
surfeited with history. The Phocaeans from Asia Minor had established a
colony there toward 560 b.c.; they were conquered by the Etruscans, who
were conquered by the Carthaginians, who were conquered by the Romans,
who were conquered by the Byzantine Greeks, who were conquered by the
Franks, who were conquered by the Moslems, who were conquered by the
Tuscan Italians, who were conquered by the Pisans, who were conquered by
the Genoese (1347). Two thirds of the population, in that century, died
from the Black Plague. Under Genoese rule the Corsicans, harassed by
pestilence and piratical raids, barred from major offices and taxed
beyond bearing, sank into a semisavagery in which violent vendettas were
the only honored law. Periodical revolts failed because of internecine
feuds and lack of foreign aid. Genoa, fighting for its own life against
Austrian armies, ap- pealed to France for help in maintaining order in
Corsica; France responded lest the island be taken by the British as a
citadel for control of the Mediter- ranean; French troops occupied
Ajaccio and other Corsican strongholds (1739-48). When peace seemed
secure the French withdrew, Genoese domination was resumed, and the
historic revolt of Paoli began.</p>
<p>Pasquale di Paoli anticipated by a century the exploits of Garibaldi.
Lord Chatham called him “one of tho se men who are no longer to be found
but in the pages of Plutarch.” 8 Bom (1725) the son of a Corsican rebel,
he fol - lowed his father into exile, studied in Naples under the
liberal economist Genovesi, served in the Neapolitan army, returned to
Corsica (1755), and was</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>3*3</p>
<p>chosen to lead a rebellion against Genoa. In two years of fighting he
suc- ceeded in driving the Genoese from all but some coastal towns. As
elected head of the new republic (1757-68) he proved himself as
brilliant in legis- lation and administration as he had shown himself in
the strategy and tactics of war. He established a democratic
constitution, suppressed the vendetta, abolished the oppressive rights
of feudal lords, spread education, and founded a university at Corte,
his capital.</p>
<p>Unable to overcome him, Genoa sold the island to France (May 15,
1768) for two million francs. Paoli now found himself fighting against
repeatedly reinforced French troops. His secretary and aide at this time
was Carlo Buonaparte, to whom a son Napoleone was born at Ajaccio on
August 15,</p>
<ol start="1769" type="1">
<li>Overwhelmed by the French at Pontenuovo (May, 1769), Paoli abandoned
the hopeless struggle and took refuge in England; there he re- ceived a
government pension, was celebrated by Boswell, and numbered Johnson
among his friends. The National Assembly of Revolutionary France
recalled him from exile, acclaimed him as “the hero and martyr of
liberty,” and made him governo r of Corsica (1791). But the French Con-
vention judged him insufficiently Jacobin; it sent a commission to
depose him; British troops came to his aid, but the British general took
control of the island and sent Paoli back to England (1795). Napoleon
dispatched a French force to expel the British (1796); the islanders
welcomed the French as coming from “the Corsican”; the British withdrew,
and Corsica submitted to France.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tuscany flourished under the Hapsburg grand dukes who succeeded the
Medici (1738). Since its nominal ruler, Francis of Lorraine, resided in
Aus- tria as the husband of Maria Theresa, the government was deputed to
a re- gency under native leaders, who rivaled the Milanese liberals in
economic reforms; seven years before Turgot’s similar attempt in France,
they estab - lished free internal trade in grains (1767). When Francis
died (1765) he was followed as grand duke by his younger son Leopold,
who developed into one of the most enterprising and courageous of the
“enlightened des - pots.” He checked corruption in office, improved the
judiciary, the admin - istration, and the finances, equalized taxation,
abolished torture, confiscation, and capital punishment, helped the
peasantry, drained marshes, ended mo- nopolies, extended free trade and
free enterprise, allowed self-government in the communes, and looked
forward to setting up a semidemocratic constitu- tion for the duchy.
Goethe was impressed by the comparative cleanliness of the Tuscan
cities, the good condition of roads and bridges, the beauty and grandeur
of the public works. 9 Leopold’s brother Joseph, on becoming sole
emperor, supported Leopold in abolishing most feudal privileges in
Tuscany, in closing many monasteries, and in reducing the power of the
clergy.</p>
<p>In ecclesiastical reforms Leopold received powerful co-operation from
Scipione de’ Ricci, bishop of Pistoia and Prato. A harsh custom in
Tuscany required all dowerless women to take the veil; Ricci joined the
Grand Duke in raising the minimum age for taking the vows, and turning
many convents</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>into schools for girls. Provision was made for secular education by
substitut- ing lay for Jesuit schools. Ricci celebrated Mass in Italian,
and discouraged superstitions, much to the displeasure of the populace.
When it was rumored that he intended to remove as spurious the famous
“girdle of the Virgin” at Prato, the people rioted and sacked the
episcopal palace. Ricci nevertheless called a diocesan synod, which met
at Pistoia in 1786 and proclaimed prin- ciples recalling the “Gallican
Articles” of 1682: that the temporal power is independent of the
spiritual (i.e., the state is independent of the Church); and that the
pope is fallible even in matters of faith.</p>
<p>Leopold lived simply, and was liked for his unassuming manners. But
as his reign progressed, and the hostility of the orthodox pressed upon
him, he grew suspicious and aloof, and employed a multitude of spies to
watch not only his enemies but his aides. Joseph advised him from
Vienna: “Let them deceive you sometimes, rather than thus torment
yourself constantly and in vain.” 10 When Leopold left Florence to
succeed Joseph as emperor</p>
<p>Goethe hurried through Tuscany to Rome. Hear him, writing on Novem-
ber 1, 1786:</p>
<p>At last I have arrived at this great capital of the world…. I have as
good as flown over the mountains of the Tirol…. My anxiety to reach Rome
was so great… that to think of stopping anywhere was out of the
question. Even in Florence I stayed only three hours. Now,… as it would
seem, I shall be put at peace for my whole life; for we may almost say
that a new life begins when a man once sees with his own eyes all that
previously he has but partially heard or read of. All the dreams of my
youth 1 now behold realized before me.</p>
<p>What a dizzy mixture it was, that eighteenth-century Rome, swarming
with beggars and nobles, cardinals and castrati, bishops and
prostitutes, monks and tradesmen, Jesuits and Jews, artists and
criminals, bravi and saints, and tourists seeking antiquities by day and
cortigiane by night. Here, within twelve miles of city walls, were pagan
amphitheaters and triumphal arches, Renaissance palaces and fountains,
three hundred churches and ten thousand priests, 170,000 people, and,
around the Vatican citadel of Catholic Christianity, the most turbulent,
lawless, and anticlerical rabble in Christen- dom. Scurrilous pamphlets
against the Church were hawked about the streets; buffoons parodied in
public squares the most sacred ceremonies of the Mass. Perhaps
Winckelmann, a timid and tender soul, exaggerated a bit:</p>
<p>In the daytime it is pretty quiet in Rome, but at night it is the
devil let loose. From the great freedom which prevails here, and from
the absence of any sort of police, the brawling, shooting, fireworks,
and bonfires in all the streets, last during the whole night…. The
populace is untamed, and the governor is weary of banishing and hanging.
11</p>
<p>Even more than Paris, Rome was a cosmopolitan city where artists,
stu-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>dents, poets, tourists mingled with prelates and princesses in the
salons, the galleries, and the theaters. Here Winckelmann and Mengs were
proclaiming the revival of the classic style. And here the harassed,
beleaguered popes were struggling to mollify the impoverished populace
with bread and benedic- tions, to hold back ambassadors pressing for the
abolition of the Jesuits, and to keep the whole complex edifice of
Christianity from crumbling under the advance of science and the
assaults of philosophy.</p>
<p>But let us go on, with Goethe, to Naples. He thought he had never
seen such joie de vivre.</p>
<p>If in Rome one can readily set oneself to study, here one can do
nothing but live. You forget yourself and the world; and to me it is a
strange feeling to go about with people who think of nothing but
enjoying themselves…. Here men know nothing of one another. They
scarcely observe that others are also going on their way, side by side
with them. They run all day backward and forward in a paradise, without
looking about them; and if the neighboring jaws of hell begin to open
and to rage, they have recourse to St. Januarius. 12</p>
<p>Don Carlos, leaving Naples for Spain in 1759, had bequeathed the
king- dom of Naples and Sicily to his eight-year-old son Ferdinand IV,
with the Marchese di Tanucci as regent. Tanucci continued that war
against the Church which he had begun under Carlos. He suppressed many
convents and monasteries, and willingly followed the directive of
Charles III of Spain to expel the Jesuits. Shortly after midnight of
November 3-4, 1767, soldiers arrested all members of the order in the
realm, and escorted them, with no possessions but the clothes they wore,
to the nearest port or frontier, whence they were deported to the Papal
States.</p>
<p>Ferdinand IV, reaching the age of sixteen (1767), ended Tanucci’s re
- gency. A year later he married Maria Carolina, pious daughter of Maria
Theresa. She soon dominated her husband and led a reaction against
Tanucci’s anticlerical policies. The Marchese’s reforms had strengthened
the Neapolitan monarchy against the feudal barons and the Church, but
they had done little to mitigate the poverty that left to the populace
no hope but in another life.</p>
<p>Sicily followed a similar curve. The erection of the cathedral of
Palermo (1782-1802) was of far more moment to the people than the
attempt of Domenico di Caraccioli to tame the feudal lords who
controlled the land. He had served many years as Neapolitan ambassador
in London and Paris, and had listened to Protestants and philosophers.
Appointed viceroy of Sicily (1781), he laid heavy taxes upon the great
landowners, reduced their feudal rights over their serfs, and ended
their privileges of choosing the local magistrates. But when he dared to
imprison a prince who protected bandits, and decreed a reduction of two
days in the holidays honoring Palermo’s patron St. Rosalia, all classes
rose against him, and he returned to Naples in defeat (1785). 13 The
philosophers had not yet proved that they understood, better than the
Church, the needs and nature of man.</p>

<p>The power of the Catholic Church rested on the natural
supernaturalism of mankind, the recognition and sublimation of sensual
impulses and pagan survivals, the encouragement of Catholic fertility,
and the inculcation of a theology rich in poetry and hope, and useful to
moral discipline and social order. In Italy the Church was also the main
source of national income, and a valued check upon a people especially
superstitious, pagan, and passionate. Superstitions abounded; as late as
1787 witches were burned at Palermo — and refreshments were served to
fashionable ladies witnessing the scene. 14 Pagan beliefs, customs, and
ceremonies survived with the genial sanction of the Church. “I have
arrived at a vivid conviction,” wrote Goethe, “that all traces</p>
<p>The Church responded in some measure to the Enlightenment. The works
of Voltaire, Rousseau, Dider ot, Helvetius, d’Holbach, La Mettrie, and
other freethinkers were of course placed on the Index Expurgatorius, but
permis- sion to read them might be obtained from the pope. Monsignor
Ventimiglio, bishop (1757-73) of Catania, had in his library full
editions of Voltaire, Helvetius, and Rousseau. 17 The Inquisition was
abolished in Tuscany and Parma in 1769, in Sicily in 1782, in Rome in
1809. In 1783 a Catholic priest, Tamburini, under the name of his friend
Trauttmansdorff, published an essay On Ecclesiastical and Civil
Toleration , in which he condemned the Inquisition, declared all
coercion of conscience to be un-Christian, and ad- vocated toleration of
all theologies except atheism. 18</p>
<p>It was the misfortune of the popes, in this second half of the
eighteenth century, that they had to face the demand of Catholic
monarchs for the total dissolution of the Society of Jesus. The movement
against the Jesuits was part of a contest of power between the
triumphant nationalism of the modern state and the internationalism of a
papacy weakened by the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the rise of
the business class. The Cath- olic enemies of the Society did not openly
press their chief objection, that it had persistently upheld the
authority of the popes as superior to that of kings, but they were
keenly resentful that an organization acknowledging no superior except
its general and the pope should in effect constitute, within each state,
an agent of a foreign power. They acknowledged the learning and piety of
the Jesuits, their contributions to science, literature, philosophy, and
art, their sedulous and efficient education of Catholic youth, their
hero- ism on foreign missions, their recapture of so much territory once
lost to Protestantism. But they charged that the Society had repeatedly

<p>it had inculcated casuistic principles excusing immorality and crime,
con- doning even the murder of kings, that it had allowed heathen
customs and beliefs to survive among its supposed converts in Asia, and
that it had of- fended other religious orders, and many of the secular
clergy, by its sharp- ness in controversy and its contemptuous tone. The
ambassadors of the Kings of Portugal, Spain, Naples, and France insisted
that the papal charter of the Society be revoked, and that the
organization be officially and uni- versally dissolved.</p>
<p>The expulsion of the Jesuits from Portugal in 1759, from France
in</p>
<p>1764-67, from Spain and Naples in 1767, had left the Society still
operative in Central and North Italy, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in
Catholic Germany, Silesia, and Poland. On February 7, 1768, they were
expelled from the Bourbon duchy of Parma, and were added to the
congestion of Jesuit refugees in the states of the Church. Pope Clement
XIII protested that Parma was a papal fief; he threatened Duke Ferdinand
VI and his min- isters with excommunication if the edict of expulsion
should be enforced; when they persisted he launched a bull declaring the
rank and title of the Duke forfeited and annulled. The Catholic
governments of Spain, Naples, and France opened war upon the papacy:
Tanucci seized the papal cities of Benevento and Pontecorvo, and France
occupied Avignon. On December 10, 1768, the French ambassador at Rome,
in the name of France, Naples, and Spain, presented to the Pope a demand
for the retraction of the bull against Parma, and for the abolition of
the Society of Jesus. The seventy-six- year-old pontiff collapsed under
the strain of this ultimatum. He sum- moned for February 3, 1769, a
consistory of prelates and envoys to consider the matter. On February 2
he fell dead through the bursting of a blood vessel in his brain.</p>
<p>The cardinals who were called to choose his successor were divided
into two factions: zelanti who proposed to defy the kings, and regalisti
who favored some pacific accommodations. As the Italian cardinals were
almost all zelanti, and soon gathered in Rome, they tried to open the
conclave be- fore the regalist cardinals from France, Spain, and
Portugal could arrive. The French ambassador protested, and the conclave
was deferred. Meanwhile Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Jesuits,
compromised their case by issuing a pamphlet questioning the authority
of any pope to abolish the Society. 19 In March Cardinal de Bernis
arrived from France, and began to canvass the cardinals with a view to
ensuring the election of a pope willing to satisfy their Catholic
Majesties. Later rumors 20 that he or others bribed, or otherwise
induced, Cardinal Giovanni Ganganelli to promise such action if chosen
have been rejected by Catholic 21 and anti-Catholic 22 historians alike.
Ganga- nelli, by common consent, was a man of great learning, devotion,
and in- tegrity; however, he belonged to the Franciscan order, which had
often been at odds with the Jesuits, both in missions and in theology.
23 On May 19, 1769, he was elected by the unanimous vote of the forty
cardinals, and took the name of Clement XIV. He was sixty-three years
old.</p>
<p>He found himself at the mercy of the Catholic powers. France and</p>

<p>Naples held on to the papal territory they had seized; Spain and
Parma were defiant; Portugal threatened to establish a patriarchate
independent of Rome; even Maria Theresa, hitherto fervently loyal to the
papacy and the Jesuits, but now losing authority to her freethinker son
Joseph II, answered the Pope’s appeal for aid by saying that she could
not resist the united will of so many potentates. Choiseul, dominating
the government of France, in- structed Bernis to tell the Pope that “if
he does not come to terms he can consider all relations with France at
an end.” 24 Charles III of Spain had sent a similar ultimatum on April
22. Clement, playing for time, promised Charles soon to “submit to the
wisdom and intelligence of your Majesty a plan for the total extinction
of the Society.” 25 He ordered his aides to consult the archives and
summarize the history, achievements, and alleged offenses of the S
ociety of Jesus. He refused to surrender to Choiseul’s demand that he
decide the issue within two months. He took three years, but finally
yielded.</p>
<p>On July 21, 1773, he signed the historic brief Doviinus ac Redemptor
Noster. It began with a long list of religious congregations that had,
in the course of time, been suppressed by the Holy See. It noted the
many com- plaints made against the Jesuits, and the many efforts of
divers popes to remedy the abuses so alleged. “We have observed with the
bittere st grief that these remedies, and others applied afterward, had
neither efficacy nor strength to put an end to the troubles, the
charges, and the complaints.” 26 The brief concluded:</p>
<p>Having recognized that the Society of Jesus could no longer produce
the abundant fruit and the great good for which it was instituted and
approved by so many popes, our predecessors, who adorned it with so many
most admirable privileges, and seeing that it was almost — and indeed
absolutely — impossible for the Church to enjoy a true and solid peace
while this order existed,… we do hereby, after a mature examination, and
of our certain knowledge, and by the plenitude of our Apostolic power,
suppress and abolish the Society of Jesus. We nullify and abrogate all
and each of its offices, functions, administrations, houses, schools,
colleges, retreats, refuges, and other establishments which be- long to
it in any manner whatever, and in every province, kingdom, or state in
which it may be found. 27</p>
<p>The brief went on to offer pensions to those Jesuits who had not yet
taken holy orders, and who wished to return to lay life; it permitted
Jesuit priests to join the secular clergy or some religious congregation
approved by the Holy See; it allowed “professed” Jesuits, who had taken
final and absolute vows, to remain in their former houses provided they
dressed like secular priests and submitted to the authority of the local
bishop.</p>
<p>For the most part, and excepting a few missionaries in China, the
Jesuits took the papal sentence of death for their Society with apparent
docility and order. Anonymous pamphlets, however, were printed and
circulated in their defense, and Ricci and several assistants were
arrested on charges, never proved, that they were in correspondence with
opponents of the decree. Ricci died in prison November 24, 1775, aged
seventy-two.</p>
<p>Clement XIV survived the edict by little more than a year. Rumors
mul- tiplied that in his last months his mind broke down. Physical ills,
including</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) VALE, ITALIA 3 1 9</p>
<p>scurvy and hemorrhoids, made every day and night a misery to him. A
cold contracted in April, 1774, never left him; by the end of August the
cardinals were already discussing the succession; and on September 22
Clement died.</p>
<p>After many delays and intrigues the conclave raised to the papacy
(Feb- ruary 15, 1775) Giovanni Braschi, who took the name of Pius VI. He
was a man of culture rather than a statesman. He collected art, charmed
every- one by his kindliness, improved the administration of the Curia,
and effected a partial reclamation of the Pontine marshes. He arranged a
peaceful modus vivendi for the Jesuits with Frederick the Great. In 1793
he joined the coali- tion against Revolutionary France. In 1796 Napoleon
invaded the Papal States; in 1798 the French army entered Rome,
proclaimed a republic, and demanded of the Pope a renunciation of all
temporal power. He refused, was arrested, and remained in various places
and conditions of imprisonment until his death (August 29, 1799). His
successor, Pius VII, made the restora- tion of the Society of Jesus
(1814) a part of the victory of the coalition against Napoleon.</p>

<li>THE LAW AND BECCARIA</li>
</ol>
<p>The morals and manners of Italy remained a mixture of violence and
indolence, vendetta and love. The fourteen-year-old Mozart wrote from
Bologna in 1770, “Italy is a sleepy country”; 28 he had not learned the
philos - ophy of siesta. His father, in 1775, was of the opinion that
“Italians are rascals all the world over.” 29</p>
<p>Both Mozart and Goethe commented on Italian crime. In Naples, wrote
Mozart, “the lazzaroni [beggars] have their own captain or head, who
draws twenty-five silver ducats from the King each month for nothing
more than to keep them in order.” 30 “What strikes the stranger most,”
wrote Goethe, “is the common occurrence of assassination. Today the
victim has been an excellent artist — Schwendemann…. The assassin with
whom he was strug- gling gave him twenty stabs; and as the watch came
up, the villain stabbed himself. This is not generally the fashion here;
the murderer usually makes for the nearest church; once there he is
quite safe.” 31 Eve ry church gave the criminal “sanctuary”— immunity
from arrest so long as he remained under its roof.</p>
<p>The law attempted to deter crime rather by severity of punishment
than by efficiency of police. Under the laws of the gentle Benedict XIV
blas- phemy was punished by flogging, and, for a third offense, five
years in the galleys. Unlawful entry of a convent at night was a capital
crime. The solici- tation or public embrace of an honorable woman
brought condemnation to the galleys for life. Defamation of character,
even if it spoke nothing but the truth, was punishable with death and
confiscation of goods. (Pasquin- ades abounded none the less.) A like
penalty was decreed for carrying con- cealed pistols. These edicts were
in many areas evaded by flight to a neigh- boring state, or by the mercy
of a judge, or by sanctuary of a church, but</p>
<p>320</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>in several instances they were strictly carried out. One man was
hanged for pretending that he was a priest, another for stealing an
ecclesiastical vest- ment which he sold for one and a quarter francs;
another was beheaded for writing a letter that accused Pope Clement XI
of a liaison with Maria Clem- entina Sobieska. 32 As late as 1762
prisoners were broken on the wheel, bone after bone, or were dragged
over the ground at the tail of a prodded horse. We should add, as a
brighter side to the picture, that some confraternities raised money to
pay the fines and secure the liberation of prisoners. Reform of the law,
in both its procedure and its penalties, became a natural part of that
humanitarian spirit born from the double parentage of a humanist En-
lightenment and a Christian ethic freed from a cruel theology.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of Italy that the most effective appeal for law
reform came in this century from a Milanese nobleman. Cesare Bonesana,
Marchese di Beccaria, was a product of the Jesuits and the philosophes.
Though rich enough to be idle, he gave himself with restless devotion to
a career of phil- osophical writing and practical reform. He refrained
from attacking the religion of the people, but confronted directly the
actual conditions of crime and punishment. He was shocked to see the
disease-breeding filth of Mil- anese jails, and to hear from prisoners
how and why they had taken to crime, and how they had been tried. He was
dismayed to find flagrant ir- regularities in procedure, inhuman
tortures of suspects and witnesses, arbi- trary severities and mercies
in judgment, and barbarous cruelties in punish- ment. About 1761 he
joined with Pietro Verri in a society which they called Dei Pugni — “The
Fists”— vowed to action as well as thought. In 1764 they started a
review, 11 Caffe, in imitation of Addison’s Spectator. And in that year
Beccaria published his historic Tratto dei delitti e delle pene ( T
reatise on Crimes and Penalties).</p>
<p>He modestly announced at the outset that he was following the lead of
The Spirit of Laws of “the immortal President” of the Bordeaux
Parlement.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical sanctuary for criminals should no longer be allowed.
Capital punishment should be abolished.</p>
<p>The little book went through six editions in eighteen months, and was
translated into twenty-two European languages. Beccaria praised the
French version by Morellet as superior to the original. Voltaire
contributed an anonymous preface to that translation, and repeatedly
acknowledged the in- fluence of Beccaria on his own efforts at law
reform. Most Italian states soon reformed their penal codes, and nearly
all Europe discarded torture by</p>

<li>Catherine was moved by Beccaria as well as Voltaire in abolishing
torture in her dominions; Frederick the Great had already ended it in
Prussia (1740) except for treason.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1768 Beccaria was appointed to a chair of law and economy founded
expressly for him in the Palatine College at Milan. In 1790 he was named
to a commission for the reform of jurisprudence in Lombardy. His
lectures anticipated several basic ideas of Adam Smith and Malthus on
the division of labor, the relation between labor and capital, and
between population and the food supply. In him the humanism of the
Renaissance was reborn as the Enlightenment in Italy.</p>

<p>/. Cagliostro</p>
<p>Giuseppe Balsamo was born to a shopkeeper in Palermo in 1743. He
matured early, and was soon an accomplished thief. At thirteen he was
en- tered as a novice in the Monastery of the Benfratelli. There he was
assigned to aid the house apothecary, from whose bottles, tubes, and
books he learned enough chemistry and alchemy to equip himself for
quackery. Required to read the lives of the saints to the friars as they
ate, he substituted for the names of the saints those of Palermo’s most
distinguished prostitutes. Flogged, he decamped, joined the underworld,
and studied the art of eating without working. He served as a pimp, a
forger, a counterfeiter, a fortune- teller, a magician, and a robber,
usually with such concealment of his traces that the police could
convict him only of insolence.</p>
<p>Seeing himself uncomfortably suspect, he moved to Messina, crossed to
Reggio Calabria, and sampled the opportunities of Naples and Rome. For a
while he lived by touching up prints and selling them as his own. He
mar- ried Lorenza Feliciani, and prospered by selling her body. Taking
the name of Marchese de’ Pellegrini, he brought his lucrative lady to
Venice, Mar - seilles, Paris, London. He arranged to have his wife
discovered in the arms of a rich Quaker; the resultant blackmail
supported them for months. He changed his name to Count di Cagliostro,
put on whiskers and the uniform of a Prussian colonel, and rechristened
his wife Countess Seraphina. He re- turned to Palermo, was arrested as a
forger, but was released on the ominous insistence of his friends, who
terrified the law.</p>
<p>As Seraphina’s charms were worn with circulation, he put his

<p>o use, concocting and selling drugs guaranteed to flatten wrinkles -
and set love aflame. Back in England he was accused of stealing a
diamond necklace, and spent a spell in jail. He joined the Freemasons,
moved to Paris, and set himself up as the Grand Cophta of Egyptian
Masonry; he assured a hundred gullibles that he had found the ancient
secrets of rejuvenation, which could be obtained through a forty days’
course of purges, sweats, root diet, phlebotomy, and theosophy. 34 As
soon as he was exposed in one city he went on to another, winning access
to moneyed families by his Masonic grip and ring. In St. Petersburg he
practiced as a doctor, treated the poor gratis, and was received by
Potemkin; but Catherine the Great’s physician, a canny Scot, analyzed
some of the doctor’s elixirs, and found them worthless; Cag - liostro
was given a day to pack and depart. In Warsaw he was exposed by another
physician in a booklet, Cagliostro demasque (1780), but before it could
catch up with him he was off to Vienna, Frankfurt, Strasbourg. There he
charmed Cardinal Prince Louis-Rene-Cdouard de Rohan, who placed in his
palace a bust of the Grand Cophta inscribed “The divine Cagliostro.” The
Cardinal brought him to Paris, and the great impostor was unwittingly
involved in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. When this hoax was ex-
posed Cagliostro was sent to the Bastille; he was soon liberated as
innocent, but was ordered to leave France (1786). He found a new
clientele in Lon- don. Meanwhile Goethe visited Cagliostro’s mother in
Sicily, and assured her that her famous son had been acquitted and was
safe. 35 *</p>
<p>From London, where doubters had multiplied, the Count and Countess
moved to Basel, Turin, Rovereto, Trent, everywhere suspected and
expelled. Seraphina begged to be taken to Rome to pray at her mother’s
grave; the</p>

<p>Giovanni Jacopo Casanova added the lordly “de Seingalt” to h is name
by a random plucking of the alphabet, as a useful honorific in
overwhelming nuns and braving the governments of Europe. Born to two
actors in Venice in 1725, he gave early promise of mental alacrity. He
was apprenticed to the law, and claimed to have received the doctorate
at the University of Padua when he was sixteen. 36 At every step in his
engaging Memoirs we must be- ware of his imagination, but he tells his
story with such self-damning candor that we may believe him though we
know he lies.</p>
<p>While at Padua he made his first conquest — Bettina, “a pretty girl
of thir - teen,” sister of his tutor the good priest Gozzi. When she
fell ill of smallpox Casanova nursed her and caught the disease; by his
own account his acts of</p>

subject of a middling play, Der Grosskophta.</li>

<p>kindness equaled his amours. In his old age, going to Padua for the
last time, “I found her old, ill and poor, and she died in my arms.” 37
Nearly all his sweethearts are represented as loving him until his
death.</p>
<p>Despite his law degree he suffered from a humiliating poverty. His
father was dead, his mother was acting in cities as far away as
St. Petersburg, and usually forgot him. He earned some bread by fiddling
in taverns and streets. But he was strong as well as handsome and brave.
When ( 1 746) the Venetian Senator Zuan Bragadino suffered a stroke
while descending a stairway, Ja- copo caught him in his arms and saved
him from a precipitate fall; thereafter the Senator protected him in a
dozen scrapes, and gave him funds to visit France, Germany, and Austria.
At Lyons he joined the Freemasons; at Paris “I became a Companion, then
a Master, of the order.” (We note with some shock that “in my time no
one in France knew how to overcharge.” 38 )</p>
<p>In 1753 he returned to Venice, and soon caught the attention of the
gov- ernment by peddling occult wisdom. A year later an official
inquisitor re- ported on him to the Senate:</p>
<p>He has insinuated himself into the good graces of the noble Zuan
Bragadino,… and has fleeced him grievously…. Benedetto Pisano tells me
that Casanova is by way of being a cabalistic philosopher, and, by false
reasoning cleverly adapted to the minds he works on, contrives to get
his livelihood…. He has made… Bragadino believe that he can evoke the
angel of light for his benefit. 39</p>
<p>Furthermore (the report continues) Casanova had sent to his friends
com- positions that revealed him as an impious freethinker. Casanova
tells us: “A certain Mme. Memno took it into her head that I was
teaching her son the precepts of atheism.” 40</p>
<p>The things I was accused of concerned the Holy Office, and the Holy
Office is a ferocious beast with whom it is dangerous to meddle. There
were certain circumstances… which made it difficult for them to shut me
up in the ec- clesiastical prisons of the Inquisition, and because of
this it was finally decided that the State Inquisition should deal with
me. 41</p>
<p>Bragadino advised him to leave Venice; Casanova refused. The next
morn- ing he was arrested, his papers were confiscated, and he was
confined without trial in I Piombi, “the Leads”— a name given to the
Venetian state prison from the plates on its roof.</p>
<p>When night came it was impossible for me to close my eyes, for three
rea- sons: first, the rats; second, the terrible din made by the clock
of St. Ma rk’s, which sounded as if it were in my room; and third, the
thousands of fleas which invaded my body, bit and stung me, poisoning my
blood to such an ex- tent that I suffered from spasmodic constrictions
amounting to convulsions. 42</p>
<p>He was sentenced to five years, but after fifteen months of
incarceration he escaped (1757), by a complication of devices, risks,
and terrors whose nar- rative became part of his stock in trade in a
dozen lands.</p>
<p>Arrived a second time in Paris, he fought a duel with the young Comte
Nicolas de La Tour d’ Auvergne, wounded him, healed him with a “magic”
ointment, won his friendship, and was introduced by him to a rich
aunt,</p>
<p>3 2 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Mme. d’Urfe, who devoutly believed in occult powers, and hoped
through them to change her sex. Casanova played upon her credulity, and
found in it a secret means of opulence. “I cannot, now that I am old,
look back upon this chapter of my life without b lushing”; 43 but it
lasted through a dozen chapters of his book. He added to his income by
cheating at cards, by or- ganizing a lottery for the French government,
and by obtaining a loan for France from the United Provinces. En route
from Paris to Bruss els “I read Helvetius’ De PEsprit all the way.” 44
(He was to offer to conservatives a persuasive example of the libertin
[freethinker] becoming a libertine — though the sequence was probably
the reverse.) At every stop he picked a mistress; at many stops he found
a former mistress; now and then he stumbled upon his own unpremeditated
progeny.</p>
<p>He visited Rousseau at Montmorency, and Voltaire at Ferney (1760); we
have already enjoyed part of that tete-a-tete. If we may believe
Casanova, he took the occasion to reprove Voltaire for exposing the
absurdities of the popular mythology:</p>
<p>Casanova: Suppose you do succeed in destroying superstition, with
what will you replace it?</p>
<p>Voltaire: I like that! When I have delivered humanity from a
ferocious mon- ster that devours it, you ask what shall I put in its
place?</p>
<p>Casanova: Superstition does not devour humanity; it is, on the
contrary, necessary to its existence.</p>
<p>Voltaire: Necessary to its existence! That is a horrible blasphemy. I
love mankind; I would like to see it, as I am, free and happy.
Superstition and liberty cannot go hand in hand. Do you think that
slavery makes for happiness?</p>
<p>Casanova: What you want, then, is the supremacy of the people?</p>
<p>Voltaire: God forbid! The masses must have a king to govern them.</p>
<p>Casanova: In that case superstition is necessary, for the people
would never give a mere man the right to rule them….</p>
<p>Voltaire: I want a sovereign ruling a free people, and bound to them
by reciprocal conditions, which should prevent any inclination to
despotism on his part.</p>
<p>Casanova: Addison says that such a sovereign… is impossible. I agree
with Hobbes: between two evils one must choose the lesser. A nation
freed from superstition would be a nation of philosophers, and
philosophers do not know how to obey. There is no happiness for a people
that is not crushed, kept down and held in leash.</p>
<p>Voltaire: Horrible! And you are of the people!…</p>
<p>Casanova: Your master passion is love of humanity. This love blinds
you. Love humanity, but love it as it is. Humanity is not susceptible to
the benefits you wish to shower upon it; these would only make it more
wretched and perverse….</p>
<p>Voltaire: I am sorry you have such a bad opinion of your fellow
creatures. 45 Wherever he went, Casanova made his way into some
aristocratic homes, for many of the European nobility were Freemasons,
or Rosicrucians, or addicts of occult lore. He not only claimed esoteric
knowledge in these fields, but in addition had a good figure, a
distinguished (though not handsome) face, a command of languages, a
seductive self-assurance, a fund of stories and wit, and a mysterious
ability to win at cards or in casino games. Every-</p>

<p>where he was sooner or later escorted to jail or the frontier. Now
and then he had to fight a duel, but, like a nation in its histories, he
never lost.</p>
<p>At last he succumbed to longing for his native land. He was free to
travel anywhere in Italy except Venice. He repeatedly applied for
permission to come back; it was finally granted, and in 1775 he was in
Venice again. He was employed by the government as a spy; his reports
were discarded as containing too much philosophy and too little
information; he was dismissed. Relapsing into his youthful ways, he
wrote a satire on the patrician Grimaldi; he was told to leave Venice or
face another stay in the Leads. He fled to Vienna (1782), to Spa, and to
Paris.</p>
<p>There he met a Count von Waldstein, who took a fancy to him and in-
vited him to serve as his librarian in the Castle of Dux in Bohemia.
Casanova’s arts of love and magic and sleight-of-hand had reached the
point of diminish- ing returns; he accepted the post at a thousand
florins per year. Arrived and installed, he was grieved to find that he
was considered a servant, and dined in the servants’ hall. At Dux he
spent his final fourteen years. There he wrote</p>
<p>Casanova lived long enough to mourn the death of the Old Regime.</p>
<p>O my dear, my beautiful France! — where, in those days, things went
so well, despite lettres de cachet, despite the corvee and the misery of
the people!… Dear France, what have you become today? The people is your
sovereign, the people, most brutal and tyrannical of all rulers. 47</p>
<p>And so, on his last day, June 4, 1798, he ended his career in timely
piety. “I have lived a philosopher, and I die a Christian.” 48 He had
mistake n sensualism for philosophy, and Pascal’s wager for
Christianity.</p>

<p>By contrast let us look at an idealist.</p>
<p>The most influential figure in the art history of this age was not an
artist, but a scholar whose mature life was dedicated to the history of
art, and whose strange death moved the soul of literate Europe. He was
born on December 9, 1717, at Stendal in Brandenburg. His cobbler father
hoped he would be a cobbler, but Johann wished to study Latin. He paid
for his early education by singing. Eager and industrious, he advanced
rapidly. He tutored less able pupils, and bought books and food. When
his teacher went blind Johann read to him, and devoured his master’s
library. He learne d Latin and Greek</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>horoughly, but he had no interest in modern foreign languages.
Hearing that the library of the late Johann Albert Fabricius, a famous
classical scholar, was to be sold at auction, he walked 178 miles from
Berlin to Hamburg, bought Greek and Latin classics, and carried them on
his shoulders back to Berlin. 49 In 1738 he entered the University of
Halle as a theological student; he did not care for theology, but he
seized the opportunity to study Hebrew. After graduating he lived by
tutoring. He read twice completely Bayle’s Dictionnaire historique et
critique , presumably with some effect upon his religious faith. In one
year he read the Iliad and the Odyssey thrice through in Greek.</p>
<p>In 1743 he accepted an invitation to be associate director of a
school at Seehausen in Altmark, at a salary of 250 thalers per year.
During the day he taught “children with scabby heads their ABC, whilst
I… was ardently longing to attain to a knowledge of the beautiful, and
was repeating similes from Homer.” 50 In the evening he tutored for his
lodging and meals, then he studied the classics till midnight, slept
till four, studied the classics again, then went wearily to teach. He
gladly accepted a call from Count von Bunau to be assistant librarian in
the chateau at Notheniz, near Dresden, for lodging and fifty to eighty
thalers a year (1748). There he reveled in one of the most extensive
book collections of the time.</p>
<p>Among those who used this library was Cardinal Archinto, papal nuncio
at the court of the Elector of Saxony. He was impressed by Winckelmann’s
learning and enthusiasm, his emaciation and pallor. “You should go to
Italy,” he told him. Johann replied that such a trip was the deepest
desire of his heart, but beyond his means. Invited to visit the nuncio
in Dresden, Winckelmann went several times. He was delighted by the
erudition and the courtesy of the Jesuits he m et in the nuncio’s home.
Cardinal Passionei, who had 300,000 volumes in Rome, offered him the
post of librarian there, for board and seventy ducats; however, the post
could be filled only by a Catholic. Winck- elmann agreed to conversion.
As he had already expressed his belief that “after death you have
nothing to dread, nothing to hope,” 51 he found no theological, only
social, difficulties in making the change. To a friend who reproached

induce me to listen to the proposal that has been made to me.” 52 *</p>
<p>On July 11, 1754, in the chapel of the nuncio at Dresden, he
professed his new faith, and arrangements were made for his journey to
Rome. For various reasons he remained for another year in Dresden,
living and studying with the painter-sculptor-etcher Adam Oesen. In May,

<p>limited edition of fifty copies his first book, Gedanken iiber die
Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in Mahler ei nnd Bildhauerkunst (
Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in fainting and Sculpture ).
Besides describing the antiques that had been gathered in Dresden, he
contended that the Greek understanding of nature was superior to the
modern, and that this was the secret of Hellenic pre- eminence in art.
He concluded that “the only way for us to become great, indeed to become
inimitably great,… is through imi- tation of the ancients”; 56 and he
thought that of all mode rn artists Raphael had done this best. This
little volume marked the beginning of the neoclassic movement in modern
art. It was well received; Klopstock and Gottsched joined in praising
both its erudition and its style. Father Rauch, confessor to Frederick
Augustus, secured for Winckelmann, from the Elector-King, a pension of
two hundred thalers for each of the next two years, and provided him
with eighty ducats for the trip to Rome. At last, on September 20, 1755,
Winckelmann set out for Italy, in the company of a young Jesuit. He was
al- ready thirty-seven years old.</p>
<p>Arrived in Rome, he had trouble at the customshouse, which
confiscated several volumes of Voltaire from his baggage; these were
returned to him later. He found lodging with five painters in a house on
the Pincian Hill- sanctified by the shades of Nicolas Poussin and Claude
Lorrain. He met Mengs, who helped him in a hundred ways. Cardinal
Passionei gave him the freedom of his library, but Winckelmann, wishing
to explore the art of Rome, refused as yet any regular employment. He
obtained permission for repeated visits to the Belvedere of the Vatican;
he spent hours before the Apollo , the Torso , and the Laocoon; in
contemplation of these sculptures his ideas took clearer form. He
visited Tivoli, Frascati, and other suburbs containing ancient remains.
His knowledge of classical art won him the friendship of Cardinal
Alessandro Albani. Cardinal Archinto gave him an apartment in the
Palazzo della Cancelleria — the Papal Chancellery; in return Winckelmann
reorganized the palace library. Now he was almost ecstatically happy.
“God owed me this,” he said; “in my youth I suffered too much.” 57 And
to a friend in Germany he wrote as a hundred distinguished visitors were
writing:</p>
<p>All is naught, compared with Rome! Formerly I thought that I had
thor- oughly studied everything, and behold, when I came hither, I
perceived that I knew nothing. Here I have become smaller than when I
came out of school to the Biinau library. If you wish to learn to know
men, here is the place; here are heads of infinite talent, men of high
endowments, beauties of the lofty char- acter which the Greeks have
given to their figures…. As the freedom en- joyed in other states is
only a shadow compared with that of Rome — which probably strikes you as
a paradox — so there is also in this place a different mode of thinking.
Rome is, I believe, the high school of the world; and I too have been
tried and refined. 58</p>
<p>In October, 1757, armed with letters of introduction, he left Rome
for Naples. There he lived in a monastery, but he dined with men like
Tanucci and Galiani. He visited cities redolent with classic history —
Pozzuoli, Baia, Misenum, Cumae — and stood in wonder before the stately
temples of Paestum.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>In May, 1758, he returned to Rome laden with antiquarian lore. In
that month he was called to Florence to catalogue and describe the
enormous col- lection of gems, casts, engravings, maps, and manuscripts
left by Baron Philip von Stosch. The task occupied him for nearly a
year, and almost ruined his health. Meanwhile Archin to died, and
Frederick the Great rav- aged Saxony; Winckelmann lost his apartment in
the Cancelleria, and his pension from the unfortunate Elector-King.
Albani came to his rescue by offering him four rooms and ten scudi per
month to take care of his library. The Cardinal himself was a fervent
antiquarian; every Sunday he drove out with Winckelmann to hunt
antiquities.</p>
<p>Winckelmann added to his reputation by issuing scholarly monographs:
On Grace in Works of Art , Remarks upon the Architecture of the Ancients
, Description of the Torso in the Belvedere , The Study of Works of Art.
In 1760 he tried to arrange a trip to Greece with Lady Or ford,
sister-in-law of Horace Walpole; the plan fell through. “Nothing in the
world have I so ardently desire d as this,” he wrote. “Willingly would I
allow one of my fingers to be cut off; indeed, I would make myself a
priest of Cybele could I but see this land under such an opportunity.”
59 The priests of Cybele had to be eunuchs, but this did not prevent
Winckelmann from denouncing an old ordinance of the Roman government
requiring the private parts of the Apollo , the Laocoon , and other
statues in the Belvedere to be covered by metal aprons; “there has
hardly ever been in Rome,” he declared, “so asinine a regulation.”</p>
<p>The sense of beauty was so dominant in him that it almost annulled
any consciousness of sex. If he felt an aesthetic preference it favored
the beauty of the virile male figure rather than the frail and
transitory loveliness of woman. The muscular Torso of Hercules seems to
have moved him more than the soft and rounded contours of the Venus de 5
Medici. He had a good word to say for hermaphrodites — at least for the
one in the Villa Borghese. 60 He protested, “I have never been an enemy
of the other sex, but my mode of life has removed me from all
intercourse with it. I might have married, and probably should have done
so, if I had revisited my native land, but now I scarcely think of it.”
61 In Seehausen his friendship with his pupil Lamprecht had taken the
place of feminine attachments; in Rome he lived with ecclesi- astics,
and seldom met young women. “For a long time,” we are told, “there dined
with him, on Saturdays, a young Roman, slender, fair, and tall, with
whom he talked of love.” 62 He “caused a portrait to be painted of a
beautiful castrato.” 63 He dedicated to the youthful Baron Friedrich
Reinhold von Berg a Treatise on the Capability of the Feeling for
Beauty; “readers fo und in it, and in the letters to Berg, the language
not of friendship but of love; and such it actually is.” 64</p>
<p>In 1762 and 1764 he visited Naples again. His Letter on the
Antiquities of Herculaneum (1762) and his Account of the Latest
Herculanean Discov- eries (1764) gave European scholars the first
orderly and scientific informa- tion about the treasures excavated there
and at Pompeii. He was now recog- nized as the supreme authority on
ancient classical art. In 1763 he received an office in the Vatican as
“antiquarian to the Apostolic Chamber.” Finally,</p>

<p>329</p>
<p>in 1764, he published the massive volumes that he had been writing
and illus - trating for seven years past: Geschichte der Kunst des
Alterthums ( History of Ancient Art).</p>
<p>Despite its long and painstaking preparation it contained many
errors, two of which were cruel hoaxes. His friend Mengs had foisted
upon him, as faithful reproductions of antique paintings, two drawings
born of Mengs’s imagination; Winckelmann listed these paintings, used
the engravings, and dedicated the entire work to Mengs. The translations
that soon appeared in French and Italian carried nearly all the errors,
to Wi nckelmann’s mortifica - tion. “We are wiser today than we were
yesterday,” he wrote to some friends. “Would to God I could show you my
History of Art entirely re - modeled and considerably enlarged! I had
not yet learned to write when I took it in hand: the thoughts were not
yet sufficiently linked together; there is wanting, in many cases, the
transition from what precedes to what follows —in which the greatest art
consists.” 65 And yet the book had accomplished a very difficult task —
to write well about art. His intense devotion to his sub- ject lifted
him to style.</p>
<p>He addressed himself literally to the history of art rather than the
much easier history of artists. After a hurried survey of Egyptian,
Phoenician, Jewish, Persian, and Etruscan art Winckelmann let all his
enthusiasm loose in 450 pages on the classical art of the Greeks. In
some final chapters he dis- cussed Greek art under the Romans. Always
his emphasis was on the Greeks, for he was convinced that they had found
the highest forms of beauty: in the refinement of line rather than in
brilliance of color, in the representation of types rather than
individuals, in the normality and nobility of the figure, in the
restraint of emotional expression, in the serenity of aspect, in the re-
pose of features even in action, and above all in the harmonious
proportion and relation of differentiated parts in a logically unified
whole. Greek art, to Winckelmann, was the Age of Reason in form.</p>
<p>He connected the superiority of Greek art with the high regard that
the Greeks paid to excellence of form in either sex. “Beauty was an
excellence</p>
<p>His book was accepted throughout Europe as an event in the history of
literature and art. Frederick the Great sent him an invitation (1765) to
come to Berlin as superintendent of the royal library and cabinet of
antiquities.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Winckelmann agreed to come for two thousand thalers per year;
Frederick offered one thousand; Winckelmann stood his ground, and
recalled the story of the castrato who demanded a fat sum for his songs;
Frederick com- plained that he asked more than his best general cost
him; “Eh bene” said the castrato, “ faccia cantare it suo generate /”
(Very well, then; let him make his general sing!). 67</p>
<p>In 1765 Winckelmann revisited Naples, this time in company with John
Wilkes, who had made Europe resound with his defiance of Parliament and
George III. After gathering more data he returned to Rome and completed
his second major work, Monumenti antichi inediti (1767). His prelate
friends had complained of his writing the History in German, which was
not yet a major medium of scholarship; now he pleased them by using
Italian, and the happy author, seated between two cardinals, had the
ecstasy of read- ing a part of his book at Castel Gandolfo to Clement
XIII and a numerous assembly of notables. However, he was accused of
having heretical books and making heretical remarks, 68 and he never
obtained from the papacy the post which he felt he deserved.</p>
<p>Perhaps in hope that he might there secure the means of seeing
Greece, he decided to visit Germany (1768). But he had so immersed
himself in classic art and Italian ways that he took no pleasure in his
native land; he ignored its scenery and resented its baroque
architecture and ornament; “Let us re - turn to Rome,” he repeated a
hundred times to his traveling companion. 69 He was received with honors
in Munich, where he was presented a beautiful antique gem. At Vienna
Maria Theresa gave him costly medallions, and both the Empress and
Prince von Kaunitz invited him to settle there; but on May 28, after
hardly a month’s absence, he turned back to Italy.</p>
<p>At Trieste he was delayed while waiting for a ship that would take
him to Ancona. During these days he developed acquaintance with another
traveler, Francesco Arcangeli. They took walks together, and occupied
adjoining rooms in the hotel. Soon Winckelmann showed him the medallions
he had received in Vienna; he did not, so far as we know, show his
gold-filled purse. On the morning of June 8, 1768, Arcangeli entered
Winckelmann’s room, found him seated at a table, and threw a noose
around his neck. Winckel- mann rose and fought; Arcangeli stabbed him
five times and fled. A physician bandaged the wounds but pronounced them
fatal. Winckelmann received the last sacrament, made his will, expressed
a desire to see and forgive his assailant, and died at four o’clock in
the afternoon. Trieste commemorates him with a handsome monument.</p>
<p>Arcangeli was captured on June 14. He confessed, and on June 18 he
was sentenced: “For the crime of murder, done by you on the body of
Johann Winckelmann,… the Imperial Criminal Court has decreed that you…
shall be broken alive on the wheel, from the head to the feet, until
your soul depart from your body.” On July 20 it was so done.</p>
<p>The limitations of Winckelmann were bound up with geography. Because
he never realized his hope of visiting Greece under conditions that
would</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>331</p>
<p>have allowed extensive study of classic remains, he thought of Greek
art in terms of Greco-Roman art as found in the museums, collections,
and palaces of Germany and Italy, and in the relics of Herculaneum and
Pompeii. His predilection for sculpture over painting, for the
representation of types rather than individuals, for tranquillity as
against the expression of emotion, for proportion and symmetry, for
imitation of the ancients as against origi- nality and experiment: all
this placed upon the creative impulses in art se- vere restraints that
resulted in the Romantic reaction against the cold rigidity of classical
forms. His concentration on Greece and Rome blinded him to the rights
and possibilities of other styles; like Louis XIV, he thought that the
genre paintings of the Netherlands were grotesqueries.</p>
<p>Even so, his achievement was remarkable. He stirred the whole
European realm of art, literature, and history with his exaltation of
Greece. He went beyond the semiclassicism of Renaissance Italy and Louis
XIV’s France to classic art itself. He aroused the modern mind to the
clean and placid perfec- tion of Greek sculpture. He turned the chaos of
a thousand marbles, bronzes, paintings, gems, and coins into a
scientific archaeology. His influence on the best spirits of the next
generation was immense. He inspired Lessing, if only to opposition; he
shared in maturing Herder and Goethe; and perhaps with- out the afflatus
that rose from Winckelmann Byron would not have crowned his poetry with
death in Greece. The ardent Hellenist helped to form the neoclassic
principles of Mengs and Thorwaldsen, and the neoclassic painting of
Jacques-Loui s David. “Winckelmann,” said Hegel, “is to be regarded as
one of those who, in the sphere of art, have known how to initiate a new
organ for the human spirit.” 70</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE ARTISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy hardly needed Winckelmann’s exhortations, for she honored her
gods, and her accumulated art served in each generation as a school of
disci- pline for a thousand artists from a dozen lands. Carlo Marchionni
designed the palatial Villa Albani (1758), into which Cardinal Albani,
guided by Winckelmann, gathered a world-famous collection of antique
sculptures — still rich after many rapes. (Napoleon stole 294 of the
pieces for France; hence, perhaps, an Italian saying of those days, Non
tutti francesi sono la- troni, ma Buona Parte — not all Frenchmen are
thieves, but a good part of them are.)</p>
<p>Venice produced nearly all the leading Italian painters of these
years, and three of them inherited already famous names. Alessandro
Longhi, son of Pietro, illustrated the genius of his people with some
delicate portraits, includ- ing two of Goldoni. 71 We have seen Domenico
Tiepolo accompanying his father to Augsburg and Madrid, and modestly
offering his specialty to the common stock. In the guest house of the
Villa V almarana he struck out for himself with genre scenes from rural
life; Peasants Reposing is an idyl of dropped tools and restful ease.
After his father’s death in Spain Domenico</p>

<p>returned to Venice, and gave his own style of humorous realism free
rein. 72</p>
<p>Francesco Guardi, brother-in-law to Giambattista Tiepolo, learned
paint- ing from his father, his brother, and Canaletto. He missed
acclaim in his gen- eration, but his vedute caught critical eyes by
seizing and conveying subtle- ties of light, and moods of atmosphere,
which may have given some hints to French Impressionists. He did not
wait for Constable’s caution, “Remember</p>
<p>Anton Raphael Mengs returned from Spain in 1768, and was soon lord of
the studios in Rome. Hardly anyone questioned his supremacy among con-
temporary artists. Crowned heads angled for his brush, sometimes in
vain. Winckelmann called him the Raphael of his age, praised his deadly
Parnas- sus as a masterpiece before which “even Raphael would have bowed
his head,” 77 and injected into the History of Ancient Art a superlative
estimate of his friend. 78</p>
<p>The best of Mengs’s paintings in this period is his self -portrait
(177 3?). 79 It shows him still vigorous, handsome, black-haired, proud
at forty-five. After a second stay in Spain Mengs returned (1777) to
spend his declining years in Italy. He continued to prosper, but the
death of his wife (1778) broke his once buoyant spirit. A variety of
ailments weakened him, and his resort to quack doctors and miraculous
cures completed his physical ruin. He died in 1779 at the age of
fifty-one. His disciples raised to his memory a cenotaph in the
Pantheon, beside the monument to Raphael. Today there is no critic so
poor to do him reverence.</p>

<p>Church music had declined with the growing secularization of life,
and had suffered infection from operatic forms. Instrumental music was
prospering, partly through the improvement of the pianoforte, but still
more with the increasing popularity of the violin. Virtuosi like
Pugnani, Viotti, and Nar- dini conquered Europe with a bow. Muzio
Clementi, who went from Italy to live for twenty years in England,
toured the Continent as organist and pianist, competed with Mozart in
Vienna, and may have profited from Mozart’s comment that his playing was
too mechanical. He was the most</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>successful piano teacher of the eighteenth century, and he
established the nineteenth-century style of piano technique with his
famous series of exer- cises and studies, Gradus ad Pamassuvi — steps to
the home of the Muses from whom music took its name. Gaetano Pugnani
inherited his master Tartini’s violin artistry, and passed it on to his
pupil Giovanni Battista Viotti, who traversed Europe triumphantly.
Viotti’s Violin Concerto in A Minor can still be enjoyed by our
old-fashioned ears.</p>
<p>Like so many Italians, Luigi Boccherini left a land crowded with
musicians to seek an audience abroad. From 1768 till his death in 1805
he charmed Spain with his cello as Farinelli had charmed it with his
voice and Scarlatti with his harpsichord. For a generation his
instrumental compositions rivaled those of Mozart in international
acclaim; Frederick William II of Prussia, himself a cellist, preferred
Boccherini’s quartets to Mozart’s. 80 In his sixty - two years he
composed ninety-five string quartets, fifty-four trios, twelve piano
quintets, twenty symphonies, five concertos for the cello, two orato-
rios, and some religious music. Half the world knows his “Minuet”— a
move- ment from one of his quintets; but all the world should know his
Concerto in B Flat for violoncello and orchestra.</p>
<p>Europe surrendered without a struggle (again excepting Paris) to the
bel canto of Italy. From a dozen cities of the Magic Boot prima donnas
like Cate- rina Gabrielli and castrati like Gasparo Pacchierotti poured
across the Alps to Vienna, Munich, Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin,
St. Petersburg, Hamburg, Brus- sels, London, Paris, and Madrid.
Pacchierotti was among the last of the famous emasculates; for a
generation he rivaled Farinelli’s career. He held London captive for
four years; his acclaim there still echoes in Fanny Bur- ney’s Diary ,
81 and in her father’s General History of Music 82</p>
<p>Italian composers and conductors followed the singers. Pietro
Guglielmi wrote two hundred operas, and moved from Naples to Dresden to
Bruns- wick to London to conduct them. Another Neapolitan, Niccolo
Piccini, has come down to us disfigured by his unwilling contest with
Gluck in Paris; but Galiani described him as un tres honnete hoimve — a
thoroughly honorable man. 83 His opere buffe were for a decade the rage
of Naples and Rome; even the Serva padrona of Pergolesi won no such
popularity as Piccini’s La cec - china (1760). Jommelli, Pergolesi, Leo,
and Galuppi had set to music Meta- stasio’s Olimpiade -, Piccini did
likewise, and, by common consent, excelled them all. In 1776 he accepted
a call to Paris; the wild war that ensued there must wait its
geographical turn; through it all Piccini carried himself with complete
courtesy, remaining friends with his rivals Gluck and Sacchini even
though their partisans threatened his life. 84 When the Revolution
drowned out this opera buff a Piccini returned to Naples. There he was
placed under house arrest for four years because of sympathy with
France; his operas were hooted from the stage, and he lived in a poverty
disgraceful to his country. After Napoleon’s conquest of Italy he was
again invited to Paris (1798); the First Consul gave him a modest
sinecure, but a paralytic stroke broke him down in body and spirit, and
he died in Paris in 1 800.</p>
<p>Antonio Sacchini was born to a fisherman at Pozzuoli, and was
being</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>rained to succeed his father when Francesco Durante heard him sing,
and carried him off to Naples as pupil and protege. His Semiramide was
so well received at the Teatro Argentino in Rome that he remained with
that thea- ter for seven years as its composer of operas. After a stay
in Venice he set off to conquer Munich, Stuttgart,… and London (1772).
His operas were applauded there, but hostile cabals damaged his
popularity, and his dis- solute habits ruined his health. Moving to
Paris, he produced his masterpiece, Oedipe a Colone (1786), which held
the boards of the Opera through 583 representations in the next
fifty-seven years; we can still hear it, now and then, on the air. He
adopted several of Gluck’s reforms; he abandoned the Italian style of
making an opera a patchwork of arias; in Oedipe the story controls the
arias, and the choruses, inspired by Handel’s oratorios, lend gran -
deur to both the music and the theme.</p>
<p>The melodious conquest went on with Antonio Salieri, foe of Mozart
and friend of the young Beethoven. Born near Verona, he was sent at the
age of sixteen to Vienna (1766); eight years later Joseph II appointed
him composer to the court, and in 1788 Kapellmeister. In this post he
preferred other com- posers to Mozart, but the story that this
opposition caused Mozart’s collapse is a myth. 85 After Mozart’s death
Salieri befriended the son and promoted his musical development.
Beethoven submitted several compositions to Salieri, and accepted his
suggestions with unwonted humility.</p>
<p>“The most radiant star in the Italian operatic firmament during the
second half of the eighteenth century” 86 was Giovanni Paisiello. Son of
a veterinary surgeon at Taranto, his voice so impressed his Jesuit
teachers there that they persuaded his father to send him to Durante’s
conservatory in Napl es (1754). When he took to composing operas he
found the Neapolitan audiences so enamored of Piccini that he accepted
an invitation from Catherine the Great. In St. Petersburg he wrote
(1782) II bar bier e di Siviglia; it had so lasting a success throughout
Europe that when Rossini offered in Rome (February 5, 1816) an opera on
the same subject it was damned by the public as an ungentlemanly
intrusion upon territory sacred to Paisiello, who was still alive. On
his way back from Russia in 1784, Paisiello stopped long enough in
Vienna to write twelve “symphonies” for Joseph II, and to produce an
opera, II re T eodoro, which soon won Europe-wide acceptance. Then he
returned to Naples as maestro di cappella to Ferdinand IV. Napoleon
persuaded Fer- din and to “lend” him Paisiello; when the composer
arrived in Paris (1802) he was received with a magnificence that made
him many enemies. In 1 804 he returned to Naples under the patronage of
Joseph Bonaparte and Murat.</p>
<p>We should note, in passing, how patiently these Italians prepared
their careers. Paisiello studied for nine years at Durante’s
Conservatorio di San Onofrio; Cimarosa studied for eleven years in the
Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto, and later at Naples. After long
tutelage under Sacchini, Piccini, and others, Domenico Cimarosa produced
his first opera, Le strava- ganze del conte. Soon his operas were heard
in Vienna, Dresden, Paris, and London. In 1787 he took his turn at
St. Petersburg, where he delighted the polyandrous Empress with
Cleopatra. Invited by Leopold II to succeed Sa-</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>lieri as Kapellmeister at Vienna, he produced there his most
celebrated opera, II matrimonio segreto (1792). It so pleased the
Emperor that at its close he ordered supper to be served to all those
present, and then commanded a repe- tition of the whole. 87 In 1793 he
was called back to Naples as maestro di cap- pella for Ferdinand IV.
When the King was deposed by a French Revolu- tionary army (1799)
Cimarosa hailed the event with enthusiasm; when Fer- dinand was restored
Cimarosa was condemned to death. The sentence was commuted to exile. The
composer set out for St. Petersburg, but died on the way at Venice
(1801). He left, in addition to many cantatas, Masses, and oratorios,
some sixty-six operas, which were far more applauded than Mo- zart’s,
and which even now must be reckoned second only to Mozart’s in the opere
buffe of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>If melody is the heart of music, Italian music is supreme. The
Germans had preferred polyphonic harmony to a simple melodic line; in
this sense Italy won another victory over Germany when the German Mozart
sub- ordinated polyphony to melody. But the Italians gave melody so
dominant a place that their operas tended to be a succession of tuneful
arias rather than musical dramas such as the first Italian opera
composers (c. 1600) had had in mind in their attempt to rival the
dramatic art of the Greeks. In Italian opera the significance of the
action, and often of the words, was lost in the glory of the song; this
was beautiful, but if, as we used to think, art is the replacement of
chaos with order to reveal significance, opera, in Italian hands, had
fallen short of its highest possibilities. Some Italians, like Jom-
melli and Traetta, acknowledged this, and strove to mold the music and
the play into a united whole; but that achievement had to await, for its
clearest form, the operas of Gluck. So, in the pendulum of life,
theTtalian conquest of Europe with melody ended when, in 1774, Gluck
produced at Paris an Iphigenie en Aulide which subordinated the music to
the play. But the con- flict between melody and drama went on; Wagner
won a battle for drama, Verdi captured new trophies for melody. May
neither side win.</p>

<li>ALFIERI</li>
</ol>
<p>There were no Dantes in this age, but there was Parini in verse,
Filangieri in prose, and Alfieri in drama, prose, and poetry.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Parini struggled up from penury, lived by copying
manuscripts, and entered print (1752) with a small volume of versi
sciolti — blank verse. He took holy orders as a means of eating, and
even then had to earn his bread by tutoring; there was a plethora of
priests in Italy. His poverty sharpened his pen to satire. Contemplating
the idleness and pomp of many Italian no- bles, he conceived the idea of
describing a typical day in such a blueblood’s life. In 1763 he issued
the first part as II mattino {Morning) ; two years later he added II
mezzogiorno {Noon) ; he completed, but never lived to publish, II vespro
{Evening) and La notte {Night) ; together they formed a substan- tial
satire, which he called II giorno {The Day). Count von Firmian
showed</p>
<p>336</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>real nobility by appointing the poet-priest editor of the Milan
Gazzetta , and professor of belles-lettres in the Scuola Palatina.
Parini welcomed the French Revolution, and was rewarded by Napoleon with
a place on the municipal council of Milan. The odes that he composed
between 1757 and 1795 are among the minor classics of Italian
literature. We get a faint echo of him in translation, as in this
sonnet, written as a lover rather than a priest:</p>
<p>Benignant Sleep, that, on soft pinion sped,</p>
<p>Dost wing through darkling night thy noiseless way,</p>
<p>And fleeting multitudes of dreams display</p>
<p>To weariness reposed on quiet bed:</p>
<p>Go where my Phillis doth her gentle head</p>
<p>And blooming cheek on peaceful pillow lay;</p>
<p>And, while the body sleeps, her soul affray</p>
<p>With dismal shape from thy enchantment bred;</p>
<p>So like unto mine own that form be made —</p>
<p>Pallor so dim disfiguring its face —</p>
<p>That she may waken by compassion swayed.</p>
<p>If this thou wilt accomplish of thy grace,</p>
<p>A double wreath of poppies I will braid,</p>
<p>And silently upon thine altar place. 88</p>
<p>To this posy let us add, as a flower from the Italian Enlightenment,
a pas- sage from Gaetano Filangieri’s La scienza de lla legislazione
(1780-85), in- spired by Beccaria and Voltaire:</p>
<p>The philosopher should not be the inventor of systems but the apostle
of truth…. So long as the evils that affect humanity are still uncured;
so long as error and prejudice are allowed to perpetuate them; so long
as the truth is limited to the few and the privileged, and concealed
from the greater part of the human species and from the kings; so long
will it remain the duty of the philosopher to preach the truth, to
sustain it, to promote it, and to illuminate it. Even if the lights he
scatters are not useful in his own century and people, they will surely
be useful in another country and century. Citizen of every place and
every age, the philosopher has the world for his country, the earth for
his school, and posterity will be his disciples 89</p>
<p>The age was summed up in Alfieri: the revolt against superstition,
the exaltation of pagan heroes, the denunciation of tyranny, the acclaim
of the French Revolution, the revulsion from its excesses, and the cry
for Italian freedom — all added to a romance of illicit love and noble
fidelity. He re- corded this passionate career in Vita di Vittorio
Alfieri… scritta da esso —his life “written by himself,” and continued
to within five months of his death. It is one of the great
autobiographies, as revealing as Rousseau’s Con - cessions. It begins
disarmingly: “Speaking— and, still more, writing — of one- self is
beyond all doubt the offspring of the grea t love one has for oneself.”
Thereafter there is no mask of modesty, and no sign of dishonesty.</p>
<p>I was born in the city of Asti in Piedmont January 1 7, 1 749, of
noble, opulent, and respectable parents. I notice these circumstances as
fortunate ones for the following reasons. Noble birth was of great
service to me,… for it enabled me, without incurring the imputation of
base or invidious motives, to disparage nobility for its own sake, to
unveil its follies, its abuses, and its crimes…. Opulence made me
incorruptible, and free to serve only the truth. 90</p>

<p>His father died when Vittorio was an infant; his mother married
again. The boy retired into himself, brooded, meditated suicide at the
age of eight, but could not hit upon any comfortable way. An uncle took
charge of him, and sent him, aged nine, to be educated at the Academy of
Turin. There he was served and bullied by a valet. His teachers tried to
break his will as the first stage in making a man of him, but their
tyranny inflamed his pride and his longing for liberty. “The class in
philosophy… was something to send one to sleep standing upright.” 91 The
death of his uncle left him, aged four- teen, master of a large
fortune.</p>
<p>Having secured the consent of the King of Sardinia as a prerequisite
to foreign travel, he set out in 1766 on a three-year tour of Europe. He
fell in love with sundry women, French literature, and the English
constitution. The reading of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau
destroyed his inherited theology, and began his hatred of the Roman
Church — though he had only recently kissed the foot of Clement XIII, “a
fine old man of venerable maj- esty.” 92 In The Hague he became
desperately enamored of a married woman; she smiled and went away; again
he contemplated suicide; this was the age of Werther, and suicide was in
the air. Again finding the idea more attractive in prospect than in
execution, he returned to Piedmont, but was so unhappy in an atmosphere
of political and religious conformity that he resumed his trav- els
(1769). ,</p>
<p>Now he went through Germany, Denmark, and Sweden — where, he tells
us, he liked the scenery, the people, and even the winter. Then to
Russia, which he despised, seeing in Catherine the Great only a crowned
criminal; he refused to be presented to her. He enjoyed Frederick’s
Prussia no better;</p>
<p>In 1774 he was sufficiently recovered to undertake his second great
ro- mance, with a woman nine years his senior. They quarreled and
parted, and he cleansed her from his dreams by writing a play, Cleopatra
; what could be more dramatic than two triumvirs, a queen, a battle, and
an asp? The piece was produced at Turin June 16, 1775, “amid applause,
for two successive nights”; then he withdrew it for alterations. He
itched now “with a very noble and elevated passion for fame.” He reread
Plutarch and the Italian classics, and studied Lat in again to delve
into Seneca’s tragedies; in these readings he found themes and form for
his dramas. He would restore ancient heroes and virtues as Winckelmann
had restored ancient art.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1777) he was writing his treatise Della tirannide , but it
con- tained such hot indictments of state and Church that he could not
think of publishing it; it came to print only in 1787. An almost
religious fervor ani- mated it:</p>
<p>Not pressing poverty,… not the slavish idleness in which Italy lies
pros- trate, no, these were not the reasons which directed my mind to
the true lofty honor of assailing false empires with my pen. A fierce
god, a god unknown, has ever been at my back scourging me on since my
earliest years…. My free</p>
<p>338 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XII</p>
<p>spirit can never find peace or truce unless I pen harsh pages for the
destruction of tyrants. 94</p>
<p>He defined tyrants as</p>
<p>all those who by force or fraud — or even by the will of the people
or the nobles — obtain the absolute reins of government, and believe
themselves to be, or are, above the law…. Tyranny is the name that must
be applied… to any gov- ernment in which he who is charged with the
execution of the laws may make, destroy, break, interpret, hinder, or
suspend them with assurance of impunity. 95</p>
<p>Alfieri considered tyrannical all European governments except the
Dutch Republic and the constitutional monarchies of England and Sweden.
Influ- enced by Machiavelli, he idealized the Roman Republic, and hoped
that revolution would soon establish republics in Europe. He thought the
best thing any minister of a tyrant could do would be to encourage him
to such excesses of tyranny as would drive the people to revolt. 96 In
its first years a revolution is justified in using violence to prevent
the revival of the tyranny:</p>
<p>As political, like religious, opinions can never be completely
changed without the use of much violence, so every new government is at
first unfortunately compelled to be cruelly stern, sometimes even
unjust, so as to convince, or pos- sibly coerce, those who neither
desire, understand, love, nor consent to innova- tions. 97</p>
<p>Though he himself was a noble as Conte di Cortemilia, Alfieri
condemned hereditary aristocracy as a form or instrument of tyranny. He
applied the same condemnation to all organized religions of authority.
He admitted that “Christianity has contributed no little to softening
universal customs,” but he noted “many acts of stupid and ignorant
ferocity” in Christian rulers “from Constantine to Charles V.” 98 In
general,</p>
<p>he Christian religion is almost incompatible with freedom…. The pope,
the Inquisition, purgatory, confession, indissoluble marriage, and the
celibacy of priests — these are the six rings of the sacred chain which
binds the profane one [the state] so much more tightly that it becomes
ever heavier and more un- breakable. 99</p>
<p>Alfieri so hated tyranny that he advised against having children, or
ever marrying, in a despotic state. Instead of children, but with
comparable Italian fertility, he produced fourteen tragedies between
1775 and 1783, all in blank verse, all classical in structure and form,
all excoriating tyranny with de- clamatory passion, and enthroning
liberty as nobler than life. So in La con- giura dei Fazzi his sympathy
was with the attempt of the conspirators to overthrow Lorenzo and
Giuliano de’ Medici; in Bruto primo and Bruto se - condo he gave short
shrift to Tarquin and Caesar; in Filippo he was all for Carlos against
the King of Spain; in Maria Stuarda , however, he found more tyranny in
the Scottish chieftains than in the Catholic Queen. Criticized for
bending history to his thesis, he defended himself:</p>
<p>More than one malicious tongue will be heard to say… that I never
depict anything but tyrants, in too many pages devoid of sweetness; that
my blood- red pen, dipped in venom, always strikes a single and
monotonous note; and</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>VALE, ITALIA</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>hat my surly Muse rouses no man from evil servitude, but makes many
laugh. These complaints will not divert my spirit from so sublime a
purpose, nor deter my art, though weak and inadequate to so great a
need. Nor will my words ever be scattered to the winds if true men are
born after us who will hold lib- erty vital to life. 100</p>
<p>Only next to his passion for freedom was his love for the Countess of
Al- bany. Daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, Prince of Stolberg-Gedern, she
married (1774) Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, who
now called himself the Count of Albany. Once so gallant as Bonnie Prince
Charlie, he had taken to drink and mistresses to forget his defeats. The
mar- riage, arranged by the French court, proved childless and unhappy.
Ap- parently the Countess herself was not without fault. Alfieri met her
in 1777, pitied her, loved her. To be near her, free to help her and
follow her fortunes without the irksome necessity of securing royal
permission for every move across the frontier, he gave up his
citizenship in Piedmont, transferred most of his fortune and estate to
his sister, and moved to Florence (1778). He was now twenty-nine years
old.</p>
<p>The Countess returned his love with a discreet delicacy that observed
all public decorum. In 1780, when her husband’s drunken violence
endangered</p>
<p>This, my fourth and last fever of love, was… quite different from
those of my first three liaisons. In those I had not found myself
agitated by any passion of intellect counterbalancing, and commingled
with, the passion of the heart. This had indeed less impetuosity and
fervor, but proved more lasting and more deeply felt. The strength of my
passion was such that it… dominated my every emotion and thought, and it
will never henceforth be extinguished in me but with life itself. It was
clear to me… that in her I had found a true woman, for instead of her
proving, like all ordinary women, an obstacle to attainment of literary
fame — one who set up occupations of utility and cheap- ened… one’s
thoughts— I found in her, for every good action, both encour- agement
and comfort and good example. Recognizing and appreciating a treas- ure
so unique, I gave myself to her with utter abandon. Certainly I was not
wrong, for now, more than twelve years later,… my passion for her in-
creases in proportion as those transitory charms (which are not her
enduring</p>
<p>34 ° ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>self) by time’s decree fade away. But concentrate d upon her, my mind
is ele- vated, softened, and with every day made better; and as regards
hers I am bold to say that the same is true, and that from me she may
draw support and strength. 103</p>
<p>So spurred on, he wrote more tragedies, some comedies, and occasional
poetry. He had already composed five odes entitled “America libera.” In
1788 the lovers moved to Paris, where Alfieri supervised the publication
of his works by Beaumarchais’ press at Kehl on the Rhine. When the
Bastille fell Alfieri, all fiery for freedom, hailed the Revolution as
the dawn of a happier age for the world. But soon the excesses of the
Revolution disgusted a soul whose conception of liberty was
aristocratic, demanding freedom from mobs and majorities as well as from
popes and kings. On August 18, 1792, he and the Countess left Paris with
such possessions as they could take in two carriages. They were stopped
at the city gates by a crowd that questioned their right to leave.
Alfieri “jumped out of the coach amongst the mob, brandishing all my
seven passports, and started in shouting and making a row,… which is
always the way to get the better of Frenchmen.” 104 They drove on to
Calais and Brussels; there they learned that the Revolutionary
authorities in Paris had ordered the arrest of the Countess. They
hurried on to Italy, and settled in Florence. Now Alfieri composed his
Misogallo, hot with hatred of France and its “crowd of ill - begotten
slaves.” 105</p>
<p>In 1799 the French Revolutionary army captured Florence. Alfieri and
the Countess took refuge in a suburban villa until the invaders
departed. The excitement of these years weakened and aged him; ending
his autobiography in 1802, aged fifty-three, he spoke of himself as
already old. After bequeath- ing all his goods to the Countess, he died
at Florence on October 7, 1803, and was buried in the Church of Santa
Croce. There in 1810 the Countess raised to him a massive monument by
Canova; she posed for the figure of Italy mourning over the tomb. She
joined her lover there in 1824.</p>
