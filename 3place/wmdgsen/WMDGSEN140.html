West</h4>
<p>I. ROME AND THE PROVINCES</p>
<p>T HE blot on Italian prosperity — aside from a system of slavery
common to ancient states — was its partial dependence upon provincial
exploita- tion. Italy was free of taxation because the provinces had
yielded so much in plunder and tribute; and to them could be traced some
of the wealth that came to flower in the Italian towns. Rome, before
Caesar, frankly classed the provinces as conquered territory; all their
inhabitants were Roman subjects, only a few were Roman citizens; all
their land was the property of the Roman state and was held by the
possessors on revocable grants from the imperial government. To lessen
the likelihood of revolt Rome cut conquered regions into smaller states,
forbade any province to have direct political dealings with another, and
favored the business classes against the lower classes everywhere.
Divide et impera was the secret of Roman rule.</p>
<p>Cicero perhaps exaggerated when, in excoriating Verres, he pictured
the Mediterranean nations as desolate under the Republic: “All the
provinces mourn, all free peoples cry out, all kingdoms protest against
our cruelty and greed; from one ocean to another there is no place,
however hidden or remote, that has not felt our lust and our iniquity.”
1 The Principate dealt</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII ) CIVILIZING THE WEST 463</p>
<p>right of appeal to the emperor, and by the financial supervision
exercised by the provincial quaestor or procurator. Such
near-omnipotence invited abuse; and though the lengthening of the
governor’s term under the Princi - pate, his ample salary and allowance,
and his financial responsibility to the emperor considerably lessened
malfeasance, we may see from the letters of Pliny and some passages in
Tacitus 2 that extortion and corruption were still no rarities at the
end of the first century.</p>
<p>Taxation was a primary industry of the governor and his aides. Under
the Empire a census was taken of every province for the purpose of
assessing the tax on land and the tax on property — which included
animals and slaves. To stimulate production a fixed tribute was
substituted for the tithe. “Publicans” no longer gathered these taxes,
but they collected port duties and managed some state forests, mines,
and public works. The provinces were expected to contribute towards a
golden crown for each new emperor, pay the cost of provincial
administration, and in some cases send heavy ship- ments of grain to
Rome. The old custom of liturgies was maintained in the East, and spread
through the West, by which the local or the Roman gov- ernment might
“ask” rich men to provide loans fo r war, ships for the navy, buildings
for public purposes, food for famine victims, or choruses for festivals
and plays.</p>
<p>Cicero, having joined the Ins, contended that the taxes paid by the
prov- inces barely covered the cost of administration and defen se ; 8
“defense” included the suppression of revolts, and “administration”
presumably em - braced the perquisites that made so many Roman
millionaires. We must reconcile ourselves to the probability that
whatever power establishes security and order will send taxgatherers to
collect something more than the cost. Despite all levies the provinces
prospered under the Principate. The emperor and the Senate exercised a
more careful supervision over provincial staffs and severely punished
those who stole beyond their station. Ultimately the excess taken from
the provinces flowed back to them in payment for their goods; and in the
end the industries so supported made the provinces stronger than a
precariously parasitic Italy. A government, said Plutarch, ought to give
a people two boons above all: liberty and peace. “As to peace,” he
wrote, “there is no need to occupy ourselves, for all war has ceased. As
to liberty, we have that which the government [Rome] leaves us; and
perhaps it would not be good if we had any more.” 4</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>AFRICA</li>
</ol>
<p>Corsica and Sardinia were classed together as a province, not as
parts of Italy. Corsica was for the most part a mountainous wilderness,
in which Romans</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>hunted the natives with dogs to sell them as slaves. 6 Sardinia
provided slaves, silver, copper, iron, and grain; it had a thousand
miles of road and one excellent harbor, Carales (Cagliari). Sicily had
been reduced to an almost purely agricul- tural province as one of th e
“frumentary supports” of Rome; its arable soil was largely taken up with
latifundia devoted to cattle raising, and manned by slaves so poorly
clothed and fed that they periodically revolted and escaped to form
robber bands. The island had in Augustus’ days some 750,000 souls. (In
1930 it had 3,972,000.) Of its sixty-five cities the most flourishing
were Catania, Syracuse, Tauromenium (Taormina), Messana, Agrigentum, and
Panormus (Palermo). Syracuse and Tauromenium had magnificent Greek
theaters, still in use today. Despite Verres’ depredations Syracuse was
so full of impressive architecture, famous sculptures, and historic
sites that professional guides prospered on the tourist trade, 0 and
Cicero considered it the finest city in the world. Most well- to-do
urban families had farms or orchards in the suburbs, and the whole
Sicilian countryside was fragrant with fruit trees and vineyards, as it
is today.</p>
<p>All that Sicily lost through Roman domination Africa gained. It
gradually replaced Sicily as an unwilling granary for Rome; but in
return Roman soldiers, colonists, businessmen, and engineers made it
blossom into a hardly credible affluence. Doubtless the new conquerors
had found certain regions thriving when they came; between the mountains
that frowned upon the Mediterranean, and the Atlas range that kept out
the Sahara, ran a semi- tropical valley sufficiently watered by the
Bagradas (Medjerda) River, and two months of rain, to repay the patient
husbandry that Mago had taught and Masinissa had enforced. But Rome
improved and expanded what she found. Her engineers built dams across
the rivers that flowed down from the southern hills; they gathered the
surplus water in reservoirs in the rainy season, and poured it into
irrigation canals in the hot months when the streams ran dry. 7 Rome
asked no heavier taxes than native chiefs had levied, but her legion and
fortifications gave better protection against nomad raiders from the
mountains; mile by mile new soil was won from desert or savagery for
cultivation and settlement. The valley produced so much olive oil that
when in our seventh century the Arabs came, they were amazed to find
that they could ride from Tripoli to Tangier without ever moving from
the shade of olive trees. 8 Towns and cities multiplied, architecture
exalted them, and literature found new voice. The ruins of Roman forums,
temples, aqueducts, and theaters on now arid wastes reveal the reach and
wealth of Roman Africa. Those fields decayed and became dead sand not
through a change in climate but through a change in government — from a
state that gave economic security, order, and discipline to one that
allowed chaos and negligence to ruin the roads, reservoirs, and
canals.</p>
<p>At the head of this restored prosperity was the resurrected city
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) CIVILIZING THE WEST 4 65</p>
<p>Carthage. After the battle of Actium Augustus took up the frustrated
project of Caius Gracchus and Caesar and sent to Carthage as colonists
some of the soldiers whose fidelity and victories he wished to reward
with land. The geographical advantages of the site, the perfect harbor,
the fertile Bagradaa delta, the excellent roads opened or reopened by
Roman engineers, soon enabled Carthage to recapture from Utica the
export and import trade of the region; within a century of its
refounding it had become the largest city in the western provinces. Rich
merchants and landowners built mansions on the historic Byrsa, or villas
in the flowering suburbs, while peasants driven from the soil by the
competition of latifundia joined prolctaires and slaves in slums whose
fetid poverty would welcome the egalitarian gospel of Christianity.
Houses rose to six or seven stories, public buildings gleamed with
marble, and statuary of good Greek style abounded in the streets and
squares. Temples were built again to the old Carthaginian gods, and
Melkart enjoyed till our second century the sacrifice of living
children.® The people rivaled the Romans in their passion for luxuries,
cosmetics, jewelry, dyed hair, chariot races, and gladiatorial games.
Among the sights of the city were the great public baths presented by
Marcus Aurelius. There were lecture halls, schools of rhetoric,
philosophy, medicine, and law; Carthage ranked only after Athens and
Alexandria as a university town. Here Apuleius and Tertullian came to
study everything, and Saint Augustine marveled at the pranks and
immorality of the students, whose favorite philanthropy was to break
into a lecture room and dismiss both the professor and his class. 10</p>
<p>Carthage was the capital of the province called “Africa,” now eastern
Tunisia. South of it commerce bedecked the eastern coast with cities
whose ancient wealth was reviving after twelve centuries when war struck
them in our time: Hadrumetum (Sousse), Leptis Minor, Thapsus, and
Tacapae (Gabes). Farther east on the Mediterranean lay a district named
Tripolis from its federation of three cities: Oea (Tripoli), founded by
the Phoenicians in 900 b.c., Sabrata, and Leptis Magna (Lebda). In this
last city the Emperor Septimius Severus was born (a.d. 146); he rewarded
it with a basilica and municipal bath whose ruins astonish the traveler
or warrior today. Paved roads busy with camel caravans connected these
ports with the towns of the interior: Sufetula, now a tiny village with
the remains of a great Roman temple; Thysdrus (El Djem), which had an
amphi- theater seating 60,000; and Thugga (Dougga), whose ruined theater
attests, by its graceful Corinthian columns, the wealth and taste of its
citizens.</p>
<p>North of Carthage was her ancient mother and implacable rival, Utica
(Utique). We catch a hint of its Roman opulence when we learn that in 46
b.c. 300 Roman bankers and wholesalers had branch offices there. 11 Its
territory reached northward to Hippo Diarrhytus, now Bizerte; thence a
road led along the coast westward to Hippo Regius (Bone), soon to be
Augustine’s episcopal</p>
<p>466 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XX.il</p>
<p>see. South and inland lay Cirta (Constantine), capital of the
province of Nu- midia. Westward lay Thamugadi (Timgad), almost as well
preserved as Pompeii, with paved and colonnaded streets, covered drains,
an elegant arch, a forum, senate house, basilica, temples, baths,
theater, library, and many private homes. On the pavement of the forum
is a checkerboard engraved with the words, Venari, lavari, ludere,
ridere, hoc est vivere — “to hunt, bathe, play, and laugh, this is to
live.” 12 Thamugadi was founded about a.d. 117 by the Third Legion, sole
guard of the African provinces. About 123 the legion took up more perma-
nent headquarters a few miles to the west, and raised the city of
Lambaesis (Lam- bese). The soldiers married and settled there, and lived
in their homes more than in the camp; but even their praetorium was a
stately and ornate edifice, whose baths were as fine as any in Africa.
Outside the camp they helped to build a capitol, temples, triumphal
arches, and an amphitheater where struggle and death might mitigate the
monotony of their peaceful lives.</p>
<p>That a single legion could protect all north Africa from the
marauding tribes of the interior was made possible by a network of
roads, military in purpose but commercial in result, binding Carthage
with the Atlantic, and the Sahara with the Mediterranean. The main road
went westward through Cirta to Caesarea, capital of Mauretania
(Morocco). Here King Juba II taught civilization to the Mauri or Moors
from whom the province took its ancient and modern names. Son of the
Juba who had died at Thapsus, he had been taken as a child to grace
Caesar’s triumph in Rome; he was spared, remained as a student, and
became one of the most learned scholars of his time. Augustus made him
client king of Maure- tania and bade him spread among his people the
classic culture he had so zealously acquired. He succeeded, being
favored with a long reign of forty-eight years; his subjects marveled
that a man could write books and yet rule so well. His son and heir was
brought to Rome and starved to death by Caligula. Claudius an- nexed the
kingdom and divided it into two provinces: Mauretania Caesariensis and
Mauretania Tingitana, named from its capital Tingis — our Tangier.</p>
<p>In these African cities there were many schools, open to the poor as
well as to the rich. We hear of courses in stenography, 13 and Juvenal
calls Africa nutricula causidicorwn — the nurse of barristers. 14 It
produced in this period one minor and one major author — Fronto and
Apuleius; only in its Christian heyday would African literature lead the
world. Lucius Apuleius was a strange and picturesque character, far more
than Montaigne “undulant and diverse.” Bom at Madaura of high family
(a.d. 124), he studied there, at Carthage, and in Athens, spent a large
inheritance recklessly, wandered from city to city and from faith to
faith, had himself initiated into various religious mysteries, played
with magic, wrote many works on subjects ranging from theology to tooth
powder, lectured at Rome and elsewhere on philosophy and religion,
returned to Africa, and married at Tripoli a lady considerably richer
than himself in both purse and years. Her friends and heirs-apparent</p>

<p>467</p>
<p>sued to annul the marriage, charging that he had persuaded the widow
by magic arts; he defended himself before the court in an Apologia that
has come down to us in refurbished form. He won his case and bride, but
the people persisted in believing him a magician, and their pagan
posterity sought to belittle Christ by recounting the miracles of
Apuleius. He spent the re- mainder of his days at Madaura and Carthage,
practicing law and medicine, letters and rhetoric. Most of his writings
were on scientific and philosophical subjects; his native city raised a
monument to him labeled Philosophus Platonicus; and he would be
chagrined, if he could return, to find himself remembered only for his
Golden Ass.</p>
<p>It is a work akin to the Satyricon of Petronius and even more
bizarre. Originally entitled Metamorphoseon Libri XI — Eleven Books of
Trans- formations — it expanded fantastically a story that Lucius of
Patras had told of a man changed into an ass. It is a loose
concatenation of adventures, descriptions, and extraneous episodes,
seasoned with magic, horror, ribaldry, and deferred piety. The Lucius of
the tale tells how he wandered into Thessaly, amused himself with
various maidens, and sensed everywhere around him an atmosphere of
sorcery.</p>
<p>As soon as night was past and a new day began to spring, I for-</p>
<p>uned to awake, and rose out of my bed as half amazed, and indeed
desirous to know and see some strange and marvelous things….</p>
<p>Neither was there anything which I saw that I did believe to be
the</p>
<p>same which it was indeed, but everything seemed to me transformed
into other shapes by the wicked power of enchantment, in so much that I
thought the stones against which I might stumble were indurate and
turned from men into that figure, and that the birds which I heard
chirping, and the trees and the running waters were changed into such
feathers and leaves and fountains. And further I thought that the</p>
<p>statues and images would by and by move, and that the walls would
talk, and the kine and other brute beasts would speak and tell strange
news, and that immediately I should hear some oracle from heaven and
from the ray of the sun. 15</p>
<p>Ready now for any adventure, Lucius rubs himself with a magic
ointment, meanwhile mightily wishing to be changed into a bird; but as
he rubs he becomes a perfect ass. Thenceforth the story records the
tribulations of an ass with “the sense and understanding of a man.” His
single consolation lies in his “long ears, whereby I might hear all
things that were even afar off.” He will be restored to human shape, he
is told, if he can find and eat a rose. He achieves this consummation
after a long Asineid of vicissitudes. Dis- enamored of life, he turns
first to philosophy, then to religion, and composes a prayer of
thanksgiving to Isis astonishingly like a Christian apostrophe to</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>he Mother of God. 16 He shaves his head, is received into the third
order of Isiac initiates, and paves a road back to earth by revealing a
dream in which Osiris, “greatest of the gods,” bids him go home and
practice law.</p>
<p>Few books embrace so much nonsense, but fewer still have phrased it
so pleasantly. Apuleius tries every manner of style and manages each
success- fully; he loves most a rich and fanciful verbiage ornate with
alliteration and assonance, picturesque slang and archaic speech,
sentimental diminutives, rhythmic and sometimes poetic prose. An
Oriental warmth of coloring ac- companies here an Oriental mysticism and
sensuality. Perhaps Apuleius wished to suggest, from the background of
his experience, that sensual indulgence is an intoxicating ferment which
changes us into beasts, and that we can become human again only through
the rose of wisdom and piety. He is at his best in the incidental
stories caught by his powerful and perambulat- ing ears; so an old woman
comforts a kidnaped maiden by recounting the romance of Cupid and Psyche
— 17 how the son of Venus fell in love with a pretty maid, gave her
every joy but that of seeing him, aroused his mother to cruel jealousy,
and came to a h appy ending in the skies. No artist’s brush, m many an
effort, has bettered the hoar shrew’s tongue in telling the ancient
tale.</p>

<li>SPAIN</li>
</ol>
<p>Crossing the straits from Tangier, we pass from one of the newest to
one of the oldest provinces of Rome. Standing strategically at the door
of the Mediterranean, blessed and cursed with precious minerals that
soaked her soil with the blood of greed, crossed with mountain ranges
that hindered communications, assimilation, and unity, Spain has felt
the full fever of life from the days when Old Stone Age artists painted
bisons on the cave walls of Altamira down to our own disordered time.
For thirty centuries the Spaniards have been a proud and warlike people,
lean and tough, stoically brave, passionate and obstinate, sober and
melancholy, frugal and hospitable, courteous and chivalrous, easily
provoked to hatred, more easily to love. When the Romans came they found
a population even then inextricably diverse: Iberians from Africa (?),
Ligurians from Italy, Celts from Gaul, and a layer of Carthaginians at
the top. If we may believe their conquerors, the pre-Roman Spaniards
were close to barbarism, some living in towns and houses, some in
hamlets and huts and caves, sleeping on the floor or the earth, and
washing their teeth with urine carefully aged. 18 The men wore black
cloaks, the women “long mantles and gay - colored gowns.” In some parts,
Strabo reprovingly adds, “the women dance promiscuously with men, taking
hold of their hands.” 19</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) CIVILIZING THE WEST 469</p>
<p>As early as 2000 b.c. the inhabitants of southeastern Spain —
Tartessus, the Phoenician “Tarshish”— had developed a bronze industry
whose products were sold throughout the Mediterranean. On this basis
Tartessus evolved in the sixth century b.c. a literature and art that
claimed an antiquity of 6000 years. Little remains of it except a few
crude statues and a strange polychrome bust in sandstone, The Lady of
Elche, carved on Greek models in a strong and flowing Celtic style.
About 1000 b.c. the Phoenicians began to tap the mineral wealth of
Spain, and by 800 they had taken Cadiz and Malaga, and built great
temples there. Towards 500 b.c. Greek colonists settled along the
northeastern coast. About the same time the Carthaginians, summoned by
their Phoenician kin to help suppress a revolt, conquered Tartessus and
all south and eastern Spain. The rapid exploitation of the peninsula by
Carthage between the First and Second Punic Wars opened the eyes of the
Romans to the res ources of what they then called “Iberia,” and the
passage of Hannibal into Italy was finally outweighed by the move- ment
of the Scipios into Spain. The disunited tribes fought fiercely for
their independence; women killed their children rather than let them
fall into Roman hands, and captive natives sang their war songs while
dying on the cross. 20 The conquest took two centuries, but once
completed it proved more fundamental than in most other provinces. The
Gracchi, Caesar, and Augustus changed t he Republic’s policy of
ruthlessness to one of courtesy and consideration, with good and lasting
results. Romanization proceeded rapidly; Latin was adopted and adapted,
the economy expanded and pros- pered, and soon Spain was contributing
poets, philosophers, senators, and emperors to Rome.</p>
<p>From Seneca to Aurelius Spain was the economic mainstay of the
Empire. Having enriched Tyre and then Carthage, Spanish minerals now
enriched Rome; Spain became to Italy what Mexico and Peru would be to
Spain. Gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, lead were mined with modem
thoroughness; at Rio Tinto one may still see Roman shafts sunk to great
depths through solid quartz, and Roman slag with an astonishingly low
percentage of copper left in it. 21 In these mines slaves and prisoners
worked day after day, in many cases never seeing the light of the sun
for months. 22 Great metallurgical industries rose near the mines.
Meanwhile the soil of Spain, despite mountains and arid wastes, produced
esparto grass for cord, rope, baskets, bedding, and sandals, nourished
prize sheep and a renowned woolen industry, and gave to the Empire the
best olives, oil, and wine that antiquity knew. The Guadal- quivir, the
Tagus, the Ebro, and lesser streams helped a web of Roman roads to carry
the products of Spain to her ports and innumerable towns.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most remarkable and characteristic result of Roman rule,
here as elsewhere, was the multiplication or expansion of cities. In the

<p>of Baetica (Andalusia) were Carteia (Algeciras), Munda, Malaca,
Italica (birthplace of Trajan and Hadrian), Corduba, Hispalis (Seville),
and Gades (Cadiz). Corduba, founded 152 b.c. was a literary center
famous for its schools of rhetori c; here were bom Lucan, the Senecas,
and Saint Paul’s Gallio; this tradition of scholarship would last
through the Dark Ages and make Cordova the most learned city in Europe.
Gades was the most popu- lous of Spanish towns, and notoriously rich;
situated at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, it commanded the Atlantic
trade with western Africa, Spain, Gaul, and Britain. Its sensuous
dancing girls ( puellae Gaditanae) contributed modestly to its fame.</p>

<p>In those days, when all ships were of moderate draught, even
ocean-going vessels could navigate the Rhone from Marseilles to Lyons;
smaller boats could continue to within thirty miles of the upper Rhine;
after a short haul over level land goods could sail by a hundred cities
and a thousand villas into the North Sea. Similar overland leaps led
from the Rhone and the Sa6ne to the Loire and the Atlantic, from the
Aude to the Garonne and Bordeaux, from the Saone to the Seine and the
English Channel. Trade followed these waterways and created cities at
their meeting points. France, like Egypt, was the gift of her
streams.</p>
<p>In a sense French ci vilization began with “Aurignacian man” 30,000
years before Christ; for even then, as the caves of Montignac attest,
there were</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) CIVILIZING THE WEST 47 1</p>
<p>artists capable of rich color and vivid line. From that Old Stone Age
of hunting and herding, France passed, about 12,000 b. c., to the
settled life and tillage of the Neolithic Age, and, after ten long
millenniums, to the Age of Bronze. About 900 b. c. a new race, “Alpine”
and roundheaded, began to filter in from Germany and spread across
France to Britain and Ireland and down into Spain. These “Celts” brought
with them the Halstatt iron culture of Austria, and about 550 b. c. they
imported from Switzerland the more developed iron technology of La Tene.
When Rome became conscious of France she named it Celtic a; only in
Caesar’s time was this changed to Gallia , Gaul.</p>
<p>The immigrants displaced some native groups and settled down in in-
dependent tribes whose names still lurk in the cities they built.* The
Gauls, said Caesar, were tall, muscular, and strong ; 28 they combed
their rich blond hair back over their heads and down the nape of their
necks; some had beards, many had powerful mustaches curling around their
mouths. They had brought from the East, perhaps from the ancient
Iranians, the custom of wearing breeches; to these they added tunics
dyed in many colors and embroidered with flowers, and striped cloaks
fastened at the shoulders. They loved jewelry and wore gold ornaments —
even if nothing else — in war. 24 They liked abundant meat, beer, and
undiluted wine, being “intemperate by nature” if we may believe Appian.
25 Strabo calls them “simple and high - spirited, boastful… insufferable
when victorious, scared out of their wits when defeated”; 20 but i t is
not always a boon that our enemies should write a book. Poseidonius was
shocked to find that they hung the severed heads of their foes from the
necks of their horses. 27 They were easily aroused to argument and
combat, and sometimes, to amuse themselves at banquets, they fought
duels to the death. “They were,” says Caesar, “our equals in valor and
warlike zeal.” 28 Ammianus Marcellinus describes them as</p>
<p>at all ages fit for military service. The old man marches out on
a</p>
<p>campaign with courage equal to that of the man in the prime of
life.</p>
<p>… In fact a whole band of foreigners will be unable to cope with</p>
<p>one Gaul if he call in his wife, who is usually far stronger and
fiercer</p>
<p>han he, above all when she swells her neck, gnashes her teeth, and
poising her huge arms, begins to rain down blows and kicks like shots
from a catapult. 20</p>
<p>The Gauls believed in a variety of gods, now too dead to mind
anonymity. Belief in a pleasant life after death was so keen as to be in
Caesar’s judgment an important source of Gallic bravery. On the strength
of it, says Valerius</p>
<p>• The Ambiani in Amiens, Bellovaci in Beauvais, Biuirigcs in Bourges,
Camutes in Chartres,</p>
<p>472 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Maximus, men lent money to be repaid in heaven; and Poseidonius
claimed to have seen Gauls at a funeral write letters to their friends
in the other world and throw them upon the pyre so that the dead man
might deliver them; 30 we should enjoy a Gaul’s opinion of these Roman
tales. A priestly class, the Druids, controlled all education and
vigorously inculcated religious belief. They conducted a colorful
ritual, in sacred groves more often than in temples; and to appease the
gods they offered human sacrifice of men con- demned to death for crime;
the custom will appear barbarous to those who have not seen an
electrocution. The Druids were the only learned, perhaps the only
literate, part of the community. They composed hymns, poems, and
historical records; they studied “the stars and their movements, the
size of the universe and the earth, and the order of nature,” 81 and
formulated a practicable calendar. They served as judges and had great
influence at the courts of the tribal kings. Pre-Roman, like medieval,
Gaul was a political feudalism clothed in theocracy.</p>
<p>Under these kings and priests Celtic Gaul reached its zenith in the
fourth century b.c. Population expanded with the productivity of the La
Tene techniques, and the result was a series of wars for land. About 400
b.c. the Celts, who already held most of central Europe as well as Gaul,
conquered Britain, Spain, and north Italy. In 390 they pushed south to
Rome; in 278 they pillaged Delphi and conquered Phrygia. A century later
their vigor began to wane, partly through the softening influence of
wealth and Greek ways, partly through the political atomism of feudal
barons. Just as in medieval France the kings broke the power of the
barons and established a unified state, conversely, in the century
before Caesar, the lords of the manors broke the power of the kings and
left Gaul more fragmentary than before. The Celtic front was pushed back
everywhere except in Ireland; the Carthaginians subdued the Celts in
Spain, the Romans drove them out of Italy, the Cimbri and Teutones
overran them in Germany and southern Gaul. In 125 b.c. the Romans, eager
to control the road to Spain, conquered southern Gaul and made it a
Roman province. In 58 b.c. the Gallic leaders begged Caesar to help them
repel a German invasion. Caesar complied and named his own reward.</p>
<p>Caesar and Augustus reorganized Gaul into four provinces: Gallia
Narbon- ensis in the south, known to the Romans as provincia, and to us
as Provence, then largely Hellenized through the Greek settlements on
the Mediterranean coast; Aquitania in the southwest, chiefly Iberian in
population; in the center Gallia Lugdunensis, overwhelmingly Celtic; and
in the northeast Belgica, pre- dominantly German. Rome recognized and
abetted these ethnic divisions to fore- stall united revolt. The tribal
cantons were retained as administrative areas; the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) CIVILIZING THE WEST 473</p>
<p>magistrates were chosen by owners of property, whose allegiance was
secured by Rome’s support of them against the lower classes; and Roman
citizenship was granted as a prize to loyal and useful Gauls. A
provincial assembly of repre- sentatives chosen from every canton met
each year in Lyons; at first it limited itself cautiously to the ritual
of Augustan worship, but soon it passed on to sending requests to the
Roman governors, then recommendations,. then demands. The administration
of justice was taken out of the hands of the Druids, who were
suppressed, and France received Roman law. For almost a century Gaul
sub- mitted peacefully to the new yoke; for a moment in a.d. 68, and
again in 71, revolt flared under Vindex and Civilis; but the people gave
scant support to these movements, and the love of liberty yielded to the
enjoyment of prosperity, se- curity, and peace.</p>
<p>Under the Pax Romana Gaul became one of the richest parts of the
Empire. Rome marveled at the wealth of the Gallic nobles who entered the
Senate under Claudius, and a century later Florus contrasted the
flourishing economy of Gaul with the decline of Italy. 33 Forests were
cleared, swamps were drained, agriculture was improved even to the
introduction of a mechanical reaper, 34 and the grape and the olive
spread into every canton of Gaul. Already in the first century Pliny and
Columella praised the wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux. There were large
estates tilled by serfs and slaves and owned by the forerunners of
medieval feudal lords; but there were also many small proprietors, and
wealth was more evenly distributed in ancient Gaul, as in modern France,
than in almost any other civilized state. Progress was especially rapid
in industry. By a. d. 200 Gallic potters and ironworkers were stealing
the markets of Germany and the West from Italy, Gallic weavers were
doing the largest textile business in the Empire, and the factories of
Lyons were turning out not only commercial glass, but wares of artistic
excellence. 35 Industrial techniques were handed down from father to son
and formed a precious part of the classical heritage. Over 13,000 miles
of road, built or improved by Roman engineers, teemed with transport and
trade.</p>
<p>Enriched with this expanded economic life, the towns of ancient
Celtica be- came the cities of Roman Gaul. In Aquitania the capital,
Burdigala (Bordeaux), was one of the busiest of Atlantic ports; Limonum
(Limoges), Avaricum (Bourges), and Augustonemetum (Clermont-Ferrand)
were already rich; the last paid Zenodotus 400,000 sesterces for a
colossus of Mercury. 30 In Gallia Nar- bonensis there were so many
cities that Pliny described it as “more like Italy than a province.” 87
Farthest west was Tolosa (Toulouse), famous for its schools. Narbo
(Narbonne), capital of the province, was in our first century the
greatest city of Gaul, the chief port of exit for Gallic goods to Italy
and Spain; “here,” - coes, a forum, a theater, temples, baths, markets,
meadows, lakes, a bridge, and the sea.” 88 Farther east, on the great
Via Domitia from Spain to Italy, lay Nemausus (Nimes). Its pretty Maison
Carree was raised by Augustus and the town to commemorate his grandsons
Lucius and Caius Caesar; its inner colonnade</p>
<p>474 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>is lamentably sunk into the cella wall, but its free Corinthian
columns are as lovely as any in Rome. The amphitheater, which seated
20,000, is still the scene of periodical pageantry. The Roman aqueduct
that brought Nimes fresh water became in time the Pont du Gard, or
Bridge of the Gard River; standing today as a gigantic ruin in the
rugged countryside beyond the city, its massive lower arches contrast to
fine effect with the smaller arches above them to make the st ructure a
revealing witness of Rome’s engineering art.</p>
<p>Eastward on the Mediterranean, at the mouth of the Rhone, Caesar
founded Arelate (Arles), in the hope that it would replace rebellious
Massalia as a ship- building center and port. Massalia (Marseilles),
already old when Caesar was born, remained Greek in language and culture
until his death. Through its harbor Hellenic agriculture, arboriculture,
viticulture, and culture had entered Gaul; here, above all, western
Europe exchanged its goods for those of the classic world. It was one of
the great university centers of the Empire, especially re- nowned for
its school of law. It declined after Caesar, but maintained its ancient
status as a free city, independent of the provincial governor. Farther
east were Forum Iulii (Frejus), Antipolis (Antibes), and Nicaea (Nice) —
this in the little province of the Maritime Alps. Sailing up the Rhone
from Arelate the traveler came to Avenio (Avignon) and Arausio (Orange);
here a powerful arch sur- vives fro m Augustus’ days, and an immense
Roman theater still hears ancient plays.</p>
<p>The largest of the Gallic provinces was Gallia Lugdunensis, named
from Lug- dunum (Lyons), its capital. Situated at the confluence of the
Rhone and the Saone, and at the crossing of great highways built by
Agrippa, the city became the trading center of a rich region and the
capital of all Gaul. Iron, glass, and ceramic industries helped to
sustain a population of 200,000 in our first century. 40 Northward lay
Cabillonum (Chalon-sur-Saone), Caesarodunum (Tours), Au- gustodunum
(Autun), Cenabum (Orleans), and Lutetia (Paris). “I have spent the
winter” (357 - 58), writes the Emperor Julian, “in our beloved Lutetia,
for so the Gauls term the little town of the Parish, a small island in
the river…. Good wine is grown here.” 41</p>
<p>Belgica, which included parts of France and Switzerland, was almost
entirely agricultural; its industry was for the most part attached to
the villas whose numerous remains suggest a baronial life of comfort and
luxury. Here Augustus founded the cities now known as Soissons,
St. Quentin, Senlis, Beauvais, and Treves. The last, Augusta Trevirorum,
rose to prominence as the headquarters of the army defending the Rhine;
under Diocletian it replaced Lyons as the capital of Gaul, and in the
fifth century it was the greatest city north of the Alps. It is still
rich in classic remains — the Porta Nigra in its Roman wall, the Baths
of St. Barbara, the Tomb of the Secundini family at nearby Igel, and the
crude reliefs on the fortress blocks of neighboring Neumagen.</p>
<p>In and around these towns life slowly changed its surface and
obstinately renewed its elements. The Gauls kept their character, their
breeches, and</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) CIVILIZING THE WEST 475</p>
<p>for three centuries their language. Latin triumphed in the sixth
century, chiefly through its use by the Roman Church, but it was already
being clipped and nosed into French. In Gaul Rome achieved her greatest
triumph in the transmission of civilization. Great French historians
like Jullian and Funck-Brentano 48 have thought that France would have
fared better with- out the Roman conquest, but a still greater historian
believed that the Roman conquest was the sole alternative to a German
conquest of Gaul. If Caesar had not won there, says Mommsen,</p>
<p>he migration of peoples would have occurred 400 years sooner than it
did, and would have come at a time when Italian civilization had not
become naturalized either in Gaul, or on the Danube, or in Africa and
Spain. Inasmuch as the great Roman general and statesman with sure
glance perceived in the German tribes the rival antagonists of the</p>
<p>Romano-Greek world; inasmuch as with firm hand he established</p>
<p>he new system of aggressive defense, down even to its details, and
taught men to protect the frontiers of the Empire by rivers and artifi-
cial ramparts… he gained for the Greco-Roman culture the in-</p>
<p>erval necessary to civilize the West. 44</p>
<p>The Rhine was the frontier between classic and primitive
civilization. Gaul could not defend that frontier; Rome did; and that
fact determined the history of Europe to this day.</p>
<p>V. BRITAIN</p>
<p>About 1200 b.c. a branch of the Celts crossed over from Gaul and
settled in England. They found there a mingled population of dark-haired
people, possibly Iberian, and light-haired Scandinavians. They conquered
these na- tives, married them, and spread through England and Wales.
About 100 b.c. (for so the egocentric foreshortening of history
telescopes eventful cen- turies, and erases vital generations from a
crowded memory) another branch of Celts came from the Continent and
dispossessed their kinsmen of southern and eastern Britain. When Caesar
came he found the island peopled by several independent tribes, each
with its expansive king. He gave to all the popula- tion the name
Britamii, from a Gallic tribe, so called, just south of the Chan- nel,
in the belief that the same tribe inhabited both shores.</p>
<p>Celtic Britain was in customs, language, and religion essentially
like</p>
<p>Celtic Gaul, but its civilization was less advanced. It passed from
bronze to iron some six centuries before Christ, three centuries after
Gaul. Pytheas, the Massiliot explorer, sailing the Atlantic to England
about 350 b.c., found the</p>
<p>47*5 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXH</p>
<p>Cantii of Kent already prosperous with agriculture and trade. The
soil was fertile from abundant rain and contained rich ores of copper,
iron, tin, and lead. By Caesar’s time domestic industry was able to
supply an act ive com- merce among the tribes and with the Continent,
and coins were minted in bronze and gold. 45 His invasions were
reconnaissance raids; he brought back the double assurance that the
tribes were incapable of united resistance and that the crops were
adequate to feed an invading army coming at the proper time. A century
later (a.d. 43) Claudius crossed the Channel with 40,000 men whose
discipline, armament, and skill proved too much for the natives; Britain
in her turn became a Roman province. In 61 a British tribal queen,
Boudicca or Boadicea, led a furious revolt, alleging that Roman officers
had ravished both her daughters, plundered her realm, and sold many of
its free- men into slavery. While the Roman governor Paulinus was busy
conquering the Isle of Alan, Boudicca’s army overcame the single legion
that opposed it and marched upon Londinium — already, says Tacitus, “the
chief residence of merchants, and a great mart of trade.” 40 Every Roman
found there or in Verulamium (St. Albans) was killed; 70,000 Romans and
their allies were slain before Paulinus and his legions caught up with
the rebel force. Boudicca, standing with her daughters in a chariot,
fought heroically in defeat. She drank poison, and 80,000 Britons were
put to the sword.</p>
<p>Tacitus tells how his father-in-law Agricola, as governor of Britain
(a.d. 78-</p>
<p>84), brought civilization to a “rude, scattered, and warlike people”
by establishing schools, spreading the use of Latin, and encouraging
cities and rich men to build te mples, basilicas, and public baths. “By
degrees,” says the caustic historian, “the</p>
<p>As Rome’s rule achieved stability it became more lenient. The cities
were man - aged by native senates, assemblies, and magistrates, and the
countryside was left, as in Gaul, to tribal chieftains amenable to Roman
surveillance. It was not so urban a civilization as Italy’s, nor so rich
as Gaul’s; but it was under Roman stimulus and protection that most
British cities now took form. Four of them were Roman “colonies,” whose
freemen enjoyed Roman citizenship: Camulo - dunum (Colchester), the
first Roman capital of Britain, and the seat of the</p>
<p>CIVILIZING THE WEST</p>
<p>CHAP. XXll)</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>provincial council; Lindum, whose modem name Lin coin declares its
ancient privilege; Eboracum (York), an important military post; and
Glevum, whose name Gloucester merges Glevum with Chester , the
Anglo-Saxon word for town.* Chester, Winchester, Dorchester, Chichester,
Leicester, Silchester, and Man- chester appear to have had their
beginnings in the first two centuries of Roman rule. These were small
towns, each with some 6000 souls; but they had paved and drained
streets, forums, basilicas, temples, and houses with stone foundations
and tiled roofs. Viroconium (Wroxeter) had a basilica accommodating 6000
persons, and public baths where hundreds could bathe at once. The hot
springs of Aquae Salis (“Salt Waters”), now Bath, made it a fashionable
resort in ancient days, as its surviving thermae show. Londinium rose to
economic and military importance because of its position on the Thames
and its radiating roads. It grew to a popu- lation of 60,000 and soon
replaced Camulodunum as Britain’s capital. 40</p>
<p>Most of the homes in Roman London were of brick and stucco, in
smaller towns, of wood. Climate determined their architecture: a gable
roof to shed rain and snow, and many windows to let in whatever sun
might shine; for even “on clear days,” said Strabo, “the sun is to be
seen only for three or four hours.” 50 But interiors followed the Roman
style — mosaic floors, large bathrooms, muraled walls, and (far more
than in Italian homes) central heating by hot-air conduits in walls and
floors. Coal — mined from surface veins — was used not only for warm-
ing houses but for industrial processes like smelting lead. Apparently
the mines of ancient Britain were owned by the state, but were leased to
private entrepre- neurs. 51 There was a factory ( fabrica ) at Bath for
the manufacture of iron weapons, 52 and probably the making of pottery,
bricks, and tiles had reached the factory stage; but most industries
were carried on in homes, small shops, and villas. Five thousand miles
of Roman roads, and innumerable waterways, were the arteries of a brisk
internal trade. A modest foreign commerce, inverting the custom of
Britain today, exported raw materials for manufactured goods.</p>
<p>How deeply did Roman civilization, in its four centuries of
domination, penetrate the life and soul of Britain? Latin became the
language of politics, law, literature, and the educated minority, but in
the countryside and among many workers in the towns the Celtic tongue
survived; even now, in Wales and the Isle of Man, it holds its own.
Roman schools in Britain spread literacy and determined the Roman form
of the English alphabet; and a stream of Latin words poured into English
speech. Temples were built to Roman gods, but the common man cherished
his Celtic deities and feasts. Even in the cities Rome sank no lasting
roots. The people submitted apathetically to a rule that brought them a
fructifying peace and such prosperity as the island would not experience
again until the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>• So Haverfield ; 48 the more widely accepted derivation is from the
Latin cas trum , fortress, or castra , camp. Most Roman-Bricish towns
were designed on the chessboard plan of a Roman camp.</p>

<li>THE BARBARIANS</li>
</ol>
<p>The decisions of Augustus and Tiberius not to attempt the conquest of
Ger- many were among the pivotal events of European history. Had Germany
been conquered and Romanized like Gaul, nearly all Europe west of Russia
would have had one organization, one government, one classic culture,
perhaps one tongue; and central Europe might have served as a buffer
against those eastern hordes whose pressure upon the Germans caused the
Germanic invasions of Italy.</p>
<p>We call them Germans, but they themselves have never used this name,
and no one knows when it came.* They were in classic days a medley of
independent tribes occupying Europe between the Rhine and the Vistula,
between the Danube and the North and Baltic Seas. Gradually, in the two
centuries from Augustus to Aurelius, they passed from migratory hunting
and herding to agriculture and village life; but they were still so far
nomadic that they rapidly exhausted the land they tilled and then moved
on to conquer new acres by the sword. If we may believe Tacitus, war was
the German’s meat and drink:</p>
<p>To cultivate the earth, and wait the regular produce of the seasons,
is not the maxim of a German; you will more readily persuade him</p>
<p>o attack the enemy and provoke honorable wounds on the field of</p>
<p>battle. To earn by the sweat of your brow what you might gain at</p>
<p>he price of your blood is in the opinion of a German a sluggish prin-
ciple, unworthy of a soldier. 63</p>
<p>The Roman historian, lamenting the deterioration of his own people
under luxury and peace, described with the exaggeration of a moralist
the martial quali- ties of the Germans, and the ardor with which the
women spurred them into battle, often fighting by their side. Flight
from the enemy meant lifelong disgrace, in many cases suicide. Strabo
described the Germans as “wilder and taller than</p>
<p>In peace, Tacitus reports, these warriors were correspondingly
indolent. The men spent their time (presumably after hunting or
harvesting) in eating heavy meals of meat and drinking rivers of beer,
while the women and children did the work of the home. 50 The German
bought his wife from her father by a gift of cattle or weapons; he had
the power of life and death over her and their children, subject to the
approval of the tribal assembly; nevertheless, women were held in</p>
<p>• Rome used the adjective germanus (from germen, offspring) to mean
bom of the same parents; and in applying it to the Germans they may have

<p>479</p>
<p>high honor, were often asked to decide tribal disputes, and were as
free to divorce their husbands as these were to divorce them. 57 Some
chieftains had several wives, but the usual German family was monogamous
and maintained (we are assured) a lofty level of marital morality.
Adultery was “seldom heard of” and was pun - ished in the woman by
cutting off her hair and driving her naked through the streets to be
flogged as she fled. The wife was allowed to practice abortion if she
wished, 58 but normally she bore many children. A man without children
was so rare that wills were not made; it was assumed that the property
of the family would go down from father to son, generation after
generation. 59</p>
<p>Four classes composed the population: (i) bondsmen, some of them
slaves, most of them serfs bound to the soil and obliged to pay the
landowner in prod- uce; (2) freedmen — unfranchised renters; (3) freemen
— landowners and warriors; and (4) nobles — landowners who traced their
pedigrees to the gods, but based their power upon substantial
patrimonies and armed bodyguards ( covntes&gt; com- panions, “counts”).
The tribal assembly was composed of nobles, guards, and freemen; they
came in arms, chose the chief or king, approved the proposals sub-
mitted to them by clashing their spears, or rejected them by a majority
of grunts. The second and third classes were partly engaged in
handicrafts and the metal- lurgical industries, in which the Germans
excelled; the fourth provided the lords and knights and chivalry of
feudal Germany.</p>
<p>Very little cultural superstructure was added to this simple social
organiza- tion. Religion had at this time barely emerged from nature
worship into the cult of anthropomorphic deities. Tacitus calls them
Mars, Mercury, and Hercules — probably Tiu (Tyr), Wodin (Odin), and
Donar (Tor); we still unwittingly commemorate them, and Frey a, the
goddess of love, on four days of every week. There was a virgin goddess
Hertha (Mother Earth), impregnated by a sky-god; and every imagination
and need was supplied by a varied population of fairies, elves, cobolds,
nixes, giants, and dwarfs. Human sacrifice was offered to Wodin, perhaps
tastier animals to other gods. Worship was conducted in the open air in
forests and groves, for the Germans thought it absurd to confine a
nature spirit in an abode built by human hands. There was no powerful
sacerdotal class like the Druids of Gaul or Britain, but there were
priests and priestesses who presided over religious ceremonies, sat as
judges in criminal cases, and divined the future by studying the motions
and neighings of white horses. As in Gaul, there were bards who sang in
rude verse the legends and history of their tribes. A small minority
could read and write, and adapted the Latin characters to form the
“runes” that serve for their alphabet. Art was primitive, but skillful
work was done in gold.</p>
<p>When Rome withdrew her legions from Germany she retained control of
the Rhine from source to mouths and divided the majestic valley into two
provinces — Upper and Lower Germany. The latter included Holland and the
Rhineland south to Cologne. This once lovely city, known to the Romans
as Colonia Agrip- pinensis, had been made a colony (a.d. 50) in h onor
of Nero’s mother, who had been bom there; half a century later it was
the most opulent settlement on the</p>
<p>480 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Rhine. The province of Upper Germany followed the Rhine southward
through Moguntiacum (Mayence), Aquae Aureliae (Baden-Baden),
Argentoratum (Strasbourg), and Augusta Rauricorum (Augst) to Vindonissa
(Windisch). Nearly all these towns had the usual array of temples,
basilicas, theaters, baths, and public statuary. Many of the legionaries
sent by Rome to guard the Rhine lived outside their camps, married
German girls, and remained as citizens when their term of service was
complete. The Rhineland was probably as thickly settled and affluent in
Roman days as at any time before the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Bet ween the Rhine and the Danube, as we have seen, Rome’s military
engineers built a fortified road ( limes ), with a fortress every nine
miles, and 300 miles of wall. It served Rome for a century, but availed
little when the Roman birth rate fell too far below the German. Still
weaker as a frontier was the Danube, which the ancients considered the
longest river in the world. South of it lay the half- barbarous
provinces of Raetia, Noricum, and Pannonia, approximately compos- ing
what our youth knew as Austria-Hungary and Serbia. On the site of modern
Augsburg (i.e., Augustus’ town) the Romans established a colony, Augusta
Vindelicorum, as a main station on the road from Italy over the Brenner
Pass to the Danube. On the river they built two fortress cities — at
Vindobona, now Vienna, and at Aquincum on the heights from which Buda
looks down upon Pesth. In southeastern Pannonia, on the Save River west
of the modem Belgrade, the city of Sirmium (Mitrovica) rose to be in
Diocletian’s time one of the four imperial capitals. South of Pannonia,
in the province of Dalmatia, the commercial energy of Greeks, Romans,
and natives had developed the Adriatic ports of Salona (Spalato),
Apollonia (near Valona), and Dyrrhachium (Durazzo). From these provinces
belo w the Danube came imperial Rome’s sturdiest soldiers and, in the
third century, the martial emperors who would for 200 years hold back
the bar- barian avalanche. East of Pannonia lay Dacia (Rumania), with
its now vanished capital of Sarmizegetusa. South and east of this Moesia
(parts of Yugoslavia, Ru- mania, and Bulgaria) boasted two cities on the
Danube — Singidunum (Belgrade) and Troesmis (Iglitza); one near the
Isker — Sardica (Sofia); and three major towns on the Black Sea —
Istrus, Tomi (Constanta), and Odessus (Vama). In these harassed
settlements Greek civilization and Roman arms struggled in vain to
maintain themselves against the Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, and other
barbarian tribes breeding and wandering north of the great stream.</p>
<p>It was Rom e’s inability to civilize these provinces south of the
Danube that led to her fall. The task was too great for a people
suffering from old age; the vitality of the master race was ebbing in
sterile comfort while the tribes of the north were advancing in reckless
health. When Trajan sub- sidized the Sarmatians to keep the peace it was
the beginning of the end; when Marcus Aurelius brought thousands of
Germans into the Empire as settlers, the dikes were down. German
soldiers were welcomed into the Roman army and rose to positions of
command; German families multiplied</p>
<p>CHAP.XXII) CIVILIZING THE WEST 481</p>
<p>in Italy while Italian families died. In this process the movement of
Roman- ization was reversed: the barbarians were barbarizing Rome.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was a magnificent and precious achievement that the
West, if not the North, had been won for the classical heritage. There,
at least, the arts of peace had emerged from the travail of war, and men
could turn their swords into plowshares without decaying in urban ease
and slums. Out of the earthy vigor of Spain and Gaul a new civilization
would rise when the barbarian flood would fall; and the seed of despot
centuries would come to fruit and pardon in the lands where the
merciless legions had brought the law of Rome and the enkindling light
of Greece.</p>
