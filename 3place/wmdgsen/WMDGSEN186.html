<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>The Struggle for Democracy</p>
<p>508-264 B.C.</p>
<p>I. PATRICIANS AND PLEBS</p>
<p>W HO were the patricians? Livy 1 thought that Romulus had chosen a
hundred clan heads of his tribe to help him establish Rome and be his
council or senate. These men were later called patres — “fathers”— and
their descendants patricii — “derived from the fathers.” Modem theory,
which lives by nibbling at tradition, likes to explain the patricians as
alien con- querors, perhaps Sabines, who invaded Latium and thereafter
ruled the Latin plebs, or populace, as a lower caste. We may believe
that they were composed of clans that through economic or military
superiority had ac- quired the best lands, and had transformed their
agricultural leadership into political mastery. These victorious clans —
the Manlii, Valerii, Aemilii, Cor- nelii, Fabii, Horatii, Claudii,
Julii, etc. — continued for five centuries to give Rome generals,
consuls, and laws. When the three original tribes united, their clan
heads made a senate of some three hundred members. They were not such
lords of comfort and luxury as their descendants; often they put their
own hands to the ax or the plow, lived vigorously on simple fare, and
wore clothing spun in their homes. The plebs admired them even when it
fought them, and applied to almost anything appertaining to them the
term classicus, “classical”— i.e., of the highest rank or class . 2</p>
<p>Close to them in wealth, but far below them in political power, were
the equites, or businessmen. Some were rich enough to win their way into
the Senate, and formed there the second part of its constituent patres (
et ) con- script! — i.e., “patricians and coinscribed men.” These two
classes were called the “orders,” and were termed bom, “the good”; for
early civilizations thought of virtue in terms of rank, ability, and
power; virtus to the Roman meant manliness, the qualities that make a
man ( vir ). Fopulus, “people,” took in only these upper classes; and
originally it was in this sense that those famous initials were used — S
P Q R ( Senatus Populusque Romanus) — which were to mark so proudly a
hundred thousand monuments . 3 Gradually, as democracy fought its way,
the word populus came to include the plebs. This was the main body of
Roman citizens. Some were artisans or trades-</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<p>men, some were freedmen, many were peasants; perhaps, in the
beginning, they were the conquered natives of the city’s hills. Some
were attached as clientes, or dependents, to an upper-class patronus; in
return for land and protection they helped him in peace, served under
him in war, and voted in the assemblies as he told them.</p>
<p>Lowest of all were the slaves. Under the kings they had been costly
and few, and therefore had been treated with consideration as valuable
members of the family. In the sixth century b.c., when Rome began her
career of con- quest, war captives were sold in rising number to the
aristocracy, the busi- ness classes, and even to plebeians; and the
status of the slave sank. Legally he could be dealt with as any other
piece of property; in theory, and accord- ing to the custom of the
ancients, his life had been forfeited by defeat, and his enslavement was
a merciful commutation of his death. Sometimes he man- aged his master’s
property, business, or funds; sometimes he became a teacher,</p>
<p>Contentment is as rare among men as it is natural among animals, and
no form of government has ever satisfied its subjects. In this system
the business - men were piqued by their exclusion from the Senate, the
richer plebeians by their exclusion from the equites; and the poorer
plebeians resented their poverty, their political disabilities, and
their liability to enslavement for debt. The law of the early Republic
allowed a creditor to imprison a per- sistently defaulting debtor in a
private dungeon, to sell him into slavery, even to kill him. Joint
creditors might, said the law, cut up the corpse of the defaulting
debtor and divide it among them — a provision apparently never enforced.
4 The plebs demanded that these laws should be repealed and the burden
of accrued debt reduced; that the lands won in war and owned by the
state should be distributed among the poor instead of being given, or
sold at nominal prices, to the rich; that plebeians should be eligible
to the magis- tracies and the priesthoods, be permitted to intermarry
with the “orders,” and have a representative of their class among the
highest officials of the gov- ernment. The Senate sought to frustrate
the agitation by fomenting wars, but it was shocked to find its calls to
the colors ignored. In 494 b.c. large masses of the plebs “seceded” to
the Sacred Mount on the river Anio, three miles from the city, and
declared that they would neither fight nor work for Rome until their
demands had been met. The Senate used every diplomatic or religious
device to lure the rebels back; then, fearing that invasion from without
might soon be added to revolt within, it agreed to a cancellation or
reduction of debts, and the establishment of two tribunes and three
aediles as the elected defenders of the plebs. The plebs returned, but
only after tak-</p>
<p>CHAP.Il) THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY 23</p>
<p>ing a solemn oath to kill any man who should ever lay violent hands
upon their representatives in the government. 5</p>
<p>This was the opening battle in a class war that ended only with the
Re- public that it destroyed. In 486 the consul Spurius Cassius proposed
an allot- ment of captured lands among the poor; the patricians accused
him of currying popular favor with a view to making himself king, and
had him killed; this was probably not the first in a long line of
agrarian proposals and Senatorial assassinations, culminating in the
Gracchi and Caesar. In 439 Spurius Maelius, who during a famine had
distributed wheat to the poor at a low price or free, was slain in his
home by an emissary of the Senate, again on the charge of plotting to be
king. 6 In 384 Marcus Manlius, who had heroically defended Rome against
the Gauls, was put to death on the same charge after he had spent his
fortune relieving insolvent debtors.</p>
<p>The next step in the climb of the plebs was a demand for definite,
written, and secular laws. Heretofore the patrician priests had been the
recorders and interpreters of the statutes, had kept their records
secret, and had used their monopoly, and the ritual requirements of the
law, as weapons against social change. After a long resistance to the
new demands, the Senate (454) sent a commission of three patricians to
Greece to study and report on the legisla- tion of Solon and other
lawmakers. When they returned, the Assembly (45 1 ) chose ten men —
decemviri — to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental
power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the presidency of a
resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, trans- formed the old customary
law of Rome into the famous Twelve Tables, submitted them to the
Assembly (which passed them with some changes), and displayed them in
the Forum for all who would — and could — to read. This seemingly
trivial event was epochal in Roman history and in the history of
mankind; it was the first written form of that legal structure which was
to be Rome’s most signal achievement and her greatest contribution to
civilization.</p>
<p>When the second year of the commission’s tenure - ended, it refused
to restore the government to the consuls and tribunes, and continued to
exercise supreme — and ever more irresponsible — authority. Appius
Claudius, says a story suspi- ciously like Lucretia’s, was stirred with
a passion for the beautiful plebeian Virginia, and, to secure her for
his pleasure, had her declared a slave. Her father, Lucius Virginius,
protested; and when Claudius refused to hear him he slew his daughter,
rushed out to his legion, and asked its aid in overthrowing the new
despot. The enraged plebs once more “seceded” to the Sacred M ount,
“imitating,” says Livy, “the moderation of their fathers by abstaining
from all injury.” 7 Learning that the army was supporting the plebs, the
patricians gathered in the senate house, deposed the Decemvirs, banished
Claudius, restored</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>the consulate, enlarged the tribunate, recognized the inviolability
of the people’s tribunes, and confirmed to the plebs the right of
appealing to the Assembly of the Centuries from the decision of any
magistrate. 8 Four years later (445) the tribune Caius Canuleius moved
that the plebs should have the right of inter- marriage with patricians,
and that plebeians should be eligible to the consulate. The Senate,
again faced by threats of war from vengeful neighbors, yielded the first
point, and averted the second by agreeing that thereafter six of the
tribunes chosen by the Centurial Assembly should have the authority of
consuls. The plebs responded handsomely by choosing all these tribuni
militum consulari potestate from the patrician class.</p>
<p>The long war with Veii (405-396), and the assault of the Gauls upon
Rome, unified the nation for a time, and stilled internal strife. But
victory and disaster alike left the plebeians destitute. While they
fought for their country their lands were neglected or ravaged, and the
interest on their debts mounted beyond possible repayment. The lenders
took no excuse, but demanded principal and interest, or the imprisonment
and enslavement of the borrowers. In 376 the tribunes Licinius and
Sextius proposed that interest already paid should be deducted from the
principal, the balance to be met in three years; that no man should be
allowed to own more than five hundred iugera (about three hundred acres)
of land, or to use on them more than a certain proportion # of slaves to
free laborers; and that one of the two consuls should regularly be
chosen from the plebs. For a decade the patricians resisted these
proposals; meanwhile, says Dio Cassius, “they stirred up war after war,
th at the people might be too occupied to agitate about the land.” 0 At
last, threatened with a third secession, the Senate accepted the
“Licinian laws,” and Camillus, leader of the conservatives, celebrated
the reconciliation of the classes by building a stately Temple of
Concord in the Forum.</p>
<p>It was a major step in the growth of Rome’s limited democracy. From
that</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the power of the Senate soon recovered after these
defeats. The demand for land was quieted by sending Romans as colonists
to conquered soil. The cost of winning and holding office — which was
unpaid — automatically dis- qualified the poor. The richer plebeians,
having secured political equality and opportunity, now co-operated with
the patricians in checking radical legisla- tion; the poorer plebeians,
shorn of .financial means, ceased for two centuries to play a
significant role in the affairs of Rome. Businessmen fell in with
patrician policy because it gave them contracts for public works,
openings for colonial</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY 25</p>
<p>and provincial exploitation, and commissions to collect taxes for the
state. The Assembly of the Centuries, whose method of voting gave the
aristocracy full control, continued to choose the magistrates, and
therefore the Senate. The tribunes, dependent upon the support of rich
plebeians, used their office as a con- servative force. Every consul,
even if chosen by the plebs, became by contagion a zealous conservative
when, at the close of his year of office, he was received into the
Senate for life. The Senate took the initiative in legislation, and
custom sanctioned its authority far beyond the letter of the law. As
foreign affairs became more important, the Senate’s firm administration
of them raised its prestige and power. When, in 264, Rome entered upon a
century of war with Carthage for the mastery of the Mediterranean, it
was the Senate that led the nation through every trial to victory; and
an imperiled and desperate people yielded without protest to its
leadership and domination.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Lawmakers</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us try to picture to ourselves this complex state, so formed
after five centuries of development. By common consent it was one of the
ablest and most successful governments that the world has yet seen;
Polybius, indeed, considered it an almost literal realization of
Aristotle’s ideal constitution.</p>
<p>It provided the framework, sometimes the battleground, of Roman
history.</p>
<p>Who, among this people, were the citizens? Technically, those who had
been bom or adopted into one of the three original tribes of Rome. In
prac- tice this meant all males above fifteen years of age who were
neither slaves nor aliens, and all aliens who had received a grant of
Roman citizenship. Never before or since has citizenship been so
jealously guarded or so highly prized. It meant membership in the
relatively small group that was soon to rule the whole Mediterranean
area; it brought immunity from legal torture or duress, and the right of
appeal from any official in the Empire to the Assembly — or, later, the
emperor — at Rome.</p>
<p>Obligations went with these privileges. The citizen, unless quite
poor, was liable to military service at call from his sixteenth to his
sixtieth year; and he could not hold political office until he had
served ten years in the army. His political rights were so bound up with
his military duties that his most important voting was done as a member
of his regiment, or “century.” In the days of the kings he had voted
also in the comitia curiata ; i.e., he and other heads of families had
come together ( cum-ire ) in a gathering of the thirty curiae, or wards,
into which the three tribes had been divided; and to the end of the
Republic it was this Curial Assembly that conferred upon the</p>
<p>2 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. II</p>
<p>elected magistrates the imperium , or authority to govern. After the
fall of the monarchy the Curial Assembly rapidly lost its other powers
to the cormtia centuriat a — the soldiers assembled in “centuries”
originally of one hundred men. It was this Centurial Assembly that chose
the magistrates, passed or rejected the measures proposed to it by
officials or the Senate, heard appeals from the judgments of
magistrates, tried all cases of capital crime charged to Roman citizens,
and decided upon war or peace. It was the broad base of both the Roman
army and the Roman government. Nevertheless, its powers were narrowly
constrained. It could convene only at the call of a consul or a tribune.
It could vote only upon such measures as were presented to it by the
magistrates or the Senate. It could not discuss or amend these pro-
posals; it could only vote Yes or No.</p>
<p>The conservative character of its decisions was guaranteed by the
class arrangement of its members. At the top were eighteen centuries of
patricians and businessmen ( equites ). Then came the “first class”— men
owning 100,000 asses’ worth of property;* these had eighty ce nturies,
or 8000 men, in the Assembly. The second class embraced citizens owning
between 75,000 and</p>
<p>100.000 asses; the third, between 50,000 and 75,000 asses; the
fourth, between</p>
<p>25.000 and 50,000 asses; and each of these classes had twenty
centuries. The fifth class included citizens owning between 11,000 and
25,000 asses, and had thirty centuries. All citizens possessing under
11,000 asses were formed into one century. 10 Each century cast one
vote, determined by a majority of its members; a small majority in one
century could cancel a large majority in another, and give the victory
to a numerical minority. Since each century voted in the order of its
financial rank, and its vote was announced as soon as taken, the
agreement of the first two groups gave at once ninety-eight votes, a
majority of the whole, so that the lower classes seldom voted at all.
Voting was direct: citizens who could not come to Rome for the meeting
had no representation in the Assembly. All this was no mere device to
disfranchise the peasants and the plebs. The classification of centuries
had been made by the census to distinguish men for taxation as well as
for war; the Romans thought it just that the right to vote should be
proportioned to taxes paid and military duties required. Citizens with
less than 11,000 asses of property had altogether only one centurial
vote; but correspondingly they paid a negligible tax and were in normal
times exempt from military service. 11 Of the proletariat, till Marius’
day, nothin g was asked except prolific parentage. Despite some later
changes, the Centurial Assembly remained a frankly conservative and
aristocratic institution.</p>
<p>Doubtless as an offset to this, the plebs had from the beginning of
the Re- public held its owjn assemblies, the concilia plebis. Out of
these councils, prob- ably, came the comitia populi tributa which we
find exercising legislative power</p>

<p>CHAP. Il) THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY 27</p>
<p>as early as 357 b.c. In this Tribal Assembly of the People the voters
were ar- ranged according to tribe and residence, on the basis of the
Servian census; each tribe had one vote, and the rich counted for no
more than the poor. After the recognition of its legislative authority
by the Senate in 287, the power of the Tribal Assembly grew until by 200
it had become the chief source of private law in Rome. It chose the
tribunes (i.e., tribal representatives) of the people ( tribuni pie bis)
as distinct from the tribuni militares elected by the centuries. Here,
too, however, there was no discussion by the people; a magistrate pro-
posed a law and defended it, another magistrate might speak against it;
the Assembly listened, and voted Yes or No. Though by its constitution
it was more progressive than the Centurial Assembly, it was far from
radical. Thirty-one of its thirty-five tribes were rural, and their
members, mostly owners of land, were cautious men. The urban
proletariat, confined to four tribes, was politically powerless before
Marius, and after Caesar.</p>
<p>The Senate remained supreme. Its original membership of clan heads
was recruited by the regular admission of ex-consuls and ex-censors, and
the censors were authorized to keep its numbers up to 300 by nominating
to it men of patrician or equestrian rank. Membership was for life, but
the Senate or a censor could dismiss any member detected in crime or
serious moral offense. The august body convened at the call of any major
magistrate in the curia, or senate house, facing the Forum. By a
pleasant custom the mem- bers brought their sons with them to attend in
silence, and to learn statesman- ship and chicanery at first hand.
Theoretically the Senate might discuss and decide only such issues as
were presented to it by a magistrate, and its deci- sions were merely
advice ( senatus consulta ), without the force of law. Actually its
prestige was so great that the magistrates nearly always accepted its
recommendations, and seldom submitted to the assemblies any measure not
already sanctioned by the Senate. Its decisions were subject to veto by
any tribune, and a defeated minority of the Senate might appeal to the
assemblies; 12 but these procedures were rare except in revolution. The
magistrates held power for a year only, while the senators were chosen
for life; inevitably this deathless monarch dominated the bearers of a
brief authority. The conduct of foreign relations, the making of
alliances and treaties, the waging of war, the government of the
colonies and provinces, the management and distribution of the public
lands, the control of the treasury and its disbursements — all these
were exclusive functions of the Senate, and gave it immense power. It
was legislature, executive, and judici- ary in one. It acted as judge in
crimes like treason, conspiracy, or assassina- tion, and appointed from
its membership the judges in most major civil trials. When a crisis came
it could issue its most formidable decree, the senatus- consultum
ultiumm, “that the consuls should see to it that no harm should</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>come to the state”— a decree that established martial law and gave
the consuls absolute command of all persons and property.</p>
<p>The Senate of the Republic * often abused its authority, defended
cor- rupt officials, waged war ruthlessly, exploited conquered provinces
greedily, and suppressed the aspirations of the people for a larger
share in the pros- perity of Rome. But never elsewhere, except from
Trajan to Aurelius, have so much energy, wisdom, and skill been applied
to statesmanship; and never elsewhere has the idea of service to the
state so dominated a government or a people. These senators were not
supermen; they made serious mistakes, sometimes vacillated in their
policies, often lost the vision of empire in the lust for personal gain.
But most of them had been magistrates, administrators, and commanders;
some of them, as proconsuls, had ruled provinces as large as kingdoms;
many of them came of families that had given statesmen or generals to
Rome for hundreds of years; it was impossible that a body made up of
such men should escape some measure of excellence. The Senate was at its
worst in victory, at its best in defeat. It could carry forward policies
that spanned generations and centuries; it could begin a war in 264 and
end it in 146 b.c. When Cineas, the philosopher who had come to Rome as
envoy of Pyrrhus (280), had heard the Senate’s deliberations and
observed its men, he reported to the new Alexander that here was no mere
gathering of venal politicians, no haphazard council of mediocre minds,
but in dignity and statesmanship veritably “an assemblage of kings.”
18</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Magistrates</li>
</ol>
<p>The maj or officials were elected by the Centurial, the minor by the
Tribal, Assembly. Each office was held by a collegium of two or more
colleagues, equal in power. All offices except the censorship ran for
only a year. The same office could be held by the same person only once
in ten years; a year had to elapse between leaving one office and taking
another; and in the interval the ex-official could be prosecuted for
malfeasance. The aspirant to a political career, if he survived a decade

four praetors who in war led armies, and in peace acted as judges and
interpreters of the law.*</p>
<p>At about this point in the cursus honorum, or sequence of offices,
the citizen who had made a name for integrity and judgment might become
one of the two censors (“valuators”) chosen every fifth year by the
Centurial Assembly. One of them would take the quinquennial census of
the citizens, and assess their property for political and military
status and for taxation. The censors were required to examine the
character and record of every candidate for office; they watched over
the honor of women, the education of children, the treatment of slaves,
the collection or farming of taxes, the construction of public
buildings, the letting of governmental property or contracts, and the
proper cultivation of the land. They could lower the rank of any
citizen, or remove any member of the Senate, whom they found guilty of
immorality or crime; and in this function the power of either censor was
immune to the veto of the other. They could try to check extravagance by
raising taxes on luxuries. They prepared and published a budget of state
expenditures on a five-year plan. At the close of their eighteen-month
term they would gather the citizens together in a solemn ceremony of
national purification ( lustrum ), as a means of maintaining cordial
relations with the gods. Appius Claudius Caecus (the Blind),
great-grandson of the Decemvir, was the first to make the censorship
rival the consulate in dignity. During his term (312) he built the
Appian Aqueduct and the Appian Way, promoted rich plebeians to the
Senate, reformed land laws and state finances, helped to break down the
priestly and patrician monopoly and manipulation of the law, left his
mark on Roman grammar, rhetoric, and poetry, and, by his deathbed speech
against Pyrrhus, decided the Roman conquest of Italy.</p>
<p>Theoretically one of the two consuls (“consultants”) had to be a
plebeian; actually very few plebeians were chosen, for even the plebs
preferred men of education and training for an office that would have to
deal with every executive phase of peace and war throughout the
Mediterranean. On the eve of the election the magistrate in charge of it
observed the stars to see if they favored the presentation of the
several candidates’ names; presiding over the Centurial Assembly on the
morrow, he might offer to its choice only those names that the auspices
had approved; 14 in this way the aris- tocracy discouraged “upstarts”
and demagogues, and in most cases the Assembly, awed or intimidated,
submitted to the pious fraud. The candidate appeared in person, dressed
in a plain white ( candidus ) toga to emphasize</p>

<p>the simplicity of his life and morals, and perhaps the more easily to
show the scars he had won in the field. If elected, he entered office on
the ensuing March 15. The consul took on sanctity by leading the state
in the most solemn religious rites. In peace he summoned and presided
over the Senate and the Assembly, initiated legislation, administered
justice, and in general executed the laws. In war he levied armies,
raised funds, and shared with his fellow consul command of the legions.
If both of them died or were captured during their year of office, the
Senate declared an interregnum , and appointed an interrex (or
interval-king) for five days, while a new elec- tion was being prepared.
The word suggests that the consuls had inherited, for their brief term,
the powers of the kings.</p>
<p>The consul was limited by the equal authority of his colleague, by
the pressure of the Senate, and by the veto power of the tribune. After
367 b.c. fourteen military tribunes were chosen to lead the tribes in
war, and ten “tribunes of the plebs” to represen t them in peace. These
ten were sacro- sancti: it was a sacrilege, as well as a capital crime,
to lay violent hands upon them except under a legitimate dictatorship.
Their function was to protect the people against the government, and to
stop by one word —veto, “I forbid” — the whole machinery of the state,
whenever to any one of them this seemed desirable. As a silent observer
the tribune could attend the meetings of the Senate, report its
deliberations to the people, and, by his veto, deprive the Se nate’s
decisions of all legal force. The door of his inviolable home remained
open day and night to any citizen who sought his protection or his aid,
and this right of sanctuary or asylum provided the equivalent of habeas
corpus. Seated on his tribunal he could act as judge, and from his
decision there was no appeal except to the Assembly of the Tribes. It
was his duty to secure the accused a fair trial, and, when possible, to
win some pardon for the condemned.</p>
<p>How did the aristocracy retain its ascendancy despite these
obstructive powers? First, by limiting them to the city of Rome and to
times of peace; in war the tribunes obeyed the consuls. Secondly, by
persuading the Tribal Assembly to elect wealthy plebeians as tribunes;
the prestige of wealth and the diffidence of poverty moved the people to
choose the rich to defend the poor. Thirdly, by allowing the number of
tribunes to be raised from four to ten; if only one of these ten would
listen to reason or money, his veto could frustrate the rest. 15 In the
course of time the tribunes became so dependable that they could be
trusted to convene the Senate, take part in its deliberations, and
become life members of it after their terms.</p>
<p>If all these maneuvers failed, a last bulwark of social order
remained — dictatorship. The Romans recognized that in times of national
chaos or peril their liberties and privileges, and all the checks and
balances that they</p>

<p>in the city by night.” 10 The parri cide was tied in a sack,
sometimes with a cock, a dog, a monkey, or a viper, and cast into the
river. 20 Within the capital, how- ever, appeal from any but a
dictator’s sentence of death could be taken by a citizen to the Assembly
of the Centuries; and if the accused perceived that the vote there was
going against him he was free to commute his sentence into exile by
leaving Rome. 21 Consequently, despite the severity of the Twelve
Tables, capital punishment of freemen was rare in republican Rome.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Army of the Republic</li>
</ol>
<p>The Roman constitution rested finally on the most successful military
organi- zation in history. The citizens and the army were one; the army
assembled in its centuries was the chief lawmaking body in the state.
The first eighteen cen- turies supplied the cavalry; the “first class”
formed the heavy infantry, armed</p>
<p>A legion was a mixed brigade of some 4200 infantry, 300 cavalry, and
various auxiliary groups; 22 two legions made a consul’s army. Each
legion was sub - divided into centuries — originally of one hundred,
later of two hundred, men — commanded by centurions. Every legion had
its vexillum — its banner or colors; honor forbade that this should ever
fall into hostile hands, and clever officers sometimes threw it into the
enemy’s ranks to stir their men to a desperate recovery. In battle the
front ranks of the infantry hurled at the foe, ten to twenty paces away,
a volley of javelins — short wooden lances with an iron point — while on
the wings archers and slingers attacked with arrows and stones, and the
cavalry charged with pikes and swords; hand-to-hand combats with short
swords were the final and decisive action. In a siege massive wooden
catapults, worked by tension or torsion, hurled ten-pound rocks over 300
yards; immense batter- ing rams, suspended on ropes, were drawn back
like a swing and then released against the enemy’s walls; an inclined
ramp of earth and timber was built, wheeled towers were pushed and
hauled up this ramp, and from these towers missiles were discharged upon
the foe 23 Instead of the solid and unwieldy phalanx — six lines of 500
men each — which the early Republic seems to have taken over from
Etruria, the legion was rearranged, about 3 66 b.c., into maniples * of
two centuries each; free room was left between each maniple and its
neighbors, and the maniples of each succeeding line stood behind these
open spaces. This formation made possible a rapid reinforcement of one
line by the next, and a quick veering of one or more maniples to face a
flank attack; and it gave free</p>
<p>• Manipulus meant a handful of hay, ferns, etc.; attached to a pole
this seems to have formed a primitive military standard; hence the word
came to mean a body of soldiers serv- ing under the same ensign.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>play to that individual combat for which the Roman soldier was
especially trained.</p>
<p>The major element in the success of this army was discipline. The
young Roman was educated for war from his childhood; he studied the
military art above all others, and spent ten formative years of his life
in field or camp. Cowardice was in that army the unforgivable sin,
punished by flogging the offender to death. 24 The general was empowered
to behead any soldier or officer, not merely for flight from battle, but
for any deviation from orders, however favorable the result. Deserters
or thieves had their right hands cut off. 25 Food in camp was simple:
bread or porridge, some vegetables, sour wine, rarely flesh; the Roman
army conquered the world o n a vegetarian diet; Caesar’s troops
complained when com ran out and they had to eat meat. 20 Labor was so
arduous and long that the soldiers begged for battle instead; valor
became the better part of discretion. The soldier received no pay till
405 b.c., and little thereafter; but he was allowed to share, according
to his rank, in the booty of the defeated — bullion and currency, lands
and men and movable goods. Such training made not only brave and eager
warriors but able and intrepid generals; the discipline of obedience
developed the capacity to command. The army of the Republic lost
battles, but it never lost a war. Men molded by stoic education and
brutal spec- tacles to a contemptuous familiarity with death carved out
the victories that conquered Italy, then Carthage and Greece, and then
the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>Such in outline was the “mixed constitution” that Polybius admired as
“the best of all existing governments”: a limited democracy in the
legislative sovereignty of the assemblies, an aristocracy in the
leadership of the patrician Senate, a Spartan “dyarchy” in the brief
royalty of the consuls, a monarchy in occasional dictatorships.
Essentially it was an aristocracy, in which old and rich families,
through ability and privilege, held office for hundreds of years, and
gave to Roman policy a tenacious continuity that was the secret of its
accomplishments.</p>
<p>But it had its faults. It was a clumsy confusion of checks and
balances in which nearly every command could in time of peace be
nullified by an equal and opposite command. The division of power was an
aid to liberty and — for a while — a restraint on malfeasance; on the
other hand, it led to great</p>

<p>marked its fall. Rome remained great as long as she had enemies who
forced her to unity, vision, and heroism. When she had overcome them all
she flourished for a moment and then began to die.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE CONQUEST OF ITALY</li>
</ol>
<p>Never had Rome been so encompassed by enemies as when she emerged
from the monarchy as a weak city-state ruling only 350 square miles —
equivalent to a space nineteen by nineteen miles. While Lars Porsena ad-
vanced upon her, many of the neighboring communities that had been sub-
jected by her kings resumed their liberty and formed a Latin League to
withstand Rome. Italy was a medley of independent tribes or cities, each
with its own government and dialect: in the north the Ligures, Gauls,
Umbrians, Etruscans, and Sabines; to the south the Latins, Volscians,
Sam- nites, Lucanians, Bruttians; along the western and southern coasts
Greek colonists in Cumae, Naples, Pompeii, Paestum, Locri, Rhegium,
Crotona, Metapontum, Tarentum. Rome was at the center of them all,
strategically placed for expansion, but perilously open to attack from
all sides at once. It was her salvation that her enemies seldom united
against her. In 505, while she was at war with the Sabines, a powerful
Sabine clan — the Claudian gens — came over to Rome and was granted
citizenship on favorable terms. In 449 the Sabines were defeated; by 290
all their territory was annexed to Rome, and by 250 they had received
the full Roman franchise.</p>
<p>In 496 the Tarquins persuaded some of the towns of Latium — Tusculum,
Ardea, Lanuvium, Aricia, Tibur, and others — to join in a war against
Rome. Faced with this apparently overwhelming combination, the Romans
appointed their first dic- tator, Aulus Postumius; at Lake Regillus they
won a saving victory, helped, they assure us, by the gods Castor and
Pollux, who left Olympus to fight in their ranks. Three years later Rome
signed a treaty with the Latin League in which all parties pledged that
“between the Romans and the cities of the Latins there shall be peace as
long as heaven and earth shall last. . . . Both shall share equally in
all booty taken in a common war.” 27 Rome became a member of the League,
then its leader, then its master. In 493 she fought the Volscians; it
was in this conflict that Caius Marcius won the name of Coriolanus by
capturing Corioli, the Volscian capital. The historians add, probably
with a touch of romance, that Coriolanus became a hard reactionary, was
banished on the insistence of the plebs (491), fled to the Volscians,
reorganized them, and led them in a siege of Rome. The starving Romans,
we are told, sent embassy after embassy to dissuade him, to no avail,
until his mother and wife went out to him and, failing in their pleas,
threatened to block his advance with their bodies. Thereupon he withdrew

<p>army, and was killed by the Volscians; or, says another story, he
lived among them to a bitter ripe old age. 28 In 405 Veii and Rome
entered upon a duel to the death for control of the Tiber. Rome besieged
the city for nine years without success, and the emboldened towns of
Etruria joined in the war. Attacked on every side, and their very
existence challenged, the Romans appointed a dictator, Camillus, who
raised a new army, captured Veii, and divided its lands among the
citizens of Rome. In 351, after sundry further wars, southern Etruria
was an- nexed to Rome under the almost modem name of Tuscia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 390, a new and greater peril appeared, and that long
duel had begun, between Rome and Gaul, which ended only with Caesar.
While Etruria and Rome were fighting fourteen wars, Celtic tribes from
Gaul and Germany had filtered down through the Alps and settled in Italy
as far south as the Po. Ancient historians called the invaders Keltai or
Celtae, Galatae or Galli, indif- ferently. Nothing is known of their
origin; we may only describe them as that branch of the Indo-European
stock which peopled western Germany, Gaul, central Spain, Belgium,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and formed the pre- Roma n languages
there. Polybius pictures them as “tall and handsome,” relishing war, and
fighting naked except for golden amulets and chains. 20 When the Celts
of southern Gaul tasted Italian wine, they were so pleased with it that
they decided to visit the land that produced such transporting fruit;
probably they were moved more by the quest for fresh acres and new
pasturage. Entering, they lived for a time in abnormal peace, tilling
and herding, and taking over the Etrus - can culture which they found in
the towns. About 400 B.c. they invaded and plundered Etruria; the
Etruscans resisted weakly, having sent most of their forces to defend
Veii against Rome. In 391, 30,000 Gauls reached Clusium; a year later
they met the Romans at the river Allia, routed them, and entered Rome
un- hindered. They sacked and burned large sections of the city, and for
seven months besieged the remnants of the Roman army on the Capitol —
the crest of the Capitoline hill. Finally the Romans yielded, and paid
the Gauls a thousand pounds of gold to depart.* They left, but returned
in 367, 358, and 350; repeatedly re- pulsed, they at last contented
themselves with northern Italy, which now became Cisalpine Gaul.</p>
<p>The surviving Romans found their city so devastated that many of them
wished to abandon the site and make Veii their capital. Camillus
dissuaded them, and the government provided financial aid for rebuilding
homes. This rapid reconstruction in the face of many enemies was a part
cause of Rome’s design - lessness and the venturesome crookedness of her
narrow streets. The subject peoples, seeing her so near destruction,
revolted again and again, and half a century of intermittent war was
required to cure their lust for freedom. The Latins, Aequi, Hemici, and
Volscians attacked in turn or together; if the Vol- scians had succeeded
they would have shut off Rome from southern Italy and</p>

<p>the sea, and perhaps have put an end to her history. In 340 the
cities of the Latin League were defeated; two years later Rome dissolved
the League and annexed nearly all Latium.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile the victories of Rome over the Volscians had brought her
face to face with the powerful Samnite tribes. These held a large cross
section of Italy from Naples to the Adriatic, with such rich cities as
Nola, Beneventum, Cumae, and Capua. They had absorbed most of the
Etruscan and Greek settlements of the west coast, and enough of
Hellenism to produce a distinctive Campanian art; probably they were
more civilized than the Romans. With them Rome fought three long and
bloody wars for the control of Italy. At the Caudine Forks (321 ) the
Romans suffered one of their greatest defeats, and their beaten army
passed “under the yoke”— an arch of hostile spears — in token of
submission. The con- suls at the front signed an abject peace, which the
Senate refused to ratify. The Samnites won the Etruscans and Gauls as
allies, and for a time Rome faced nearly all Italy in arms. But the
legions gained a decisive victory at Sentinum (295), and Rome added
Campania and Umbria to her domain. Twelve years later she drove the
Gauls back beyond the Po, and again reduced Etruria to a subject state.
Between the Gallic north and the Greek south, Rome was now master of
Italy. Insatiate and insecure, she offered the cities of Magna Graecia a
choice between alliance under Roman hegemony and war. Preferring Rome to
further absorption by the “barbarian” (i.e., Italian) tribes who were
multi - plying around and within them, Thurii, Locri, and Crotona
consented; probably they, too, like the towns of Latium, were troubled
by class war, and received Roman garrisons as a protection of property
owners against a rising plebs . 82 Tarentum was obstinate, and called
over to her aid Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. This gallant warrior, fevered
with memories of Achilles and Alexander, crossed the Adriatic with an
Epirote force, defeated the Romans at Heraclea (280), and gave an
adjective to European languages by mourning the costliness of his
victory . 33 All the Greek cities of Italy now joined him, and the
Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites declared themselves his allies. He
dispatched Cineas to Rome with offers of peace, and freed his 2000 Roman
prisoners on their word to return if Rome preferred war. The Senate was
about to make terms when old blind Appius Claudius, who had long since
retired from public life, had himself carried to the senate house and
demanded that Rome should never make peace with a foreign army on
Italian soil. The Senate sent back to Pyrrhus the prisoners whom he had
released, and resumed the war. The young king won another victory; then,
disgusted with the sloth and cowardice of his allies, he sailed with
his</p>
<p>• This war was marked by two probably legendary deeds. One consul ,
Publius Decius, rode to his death amid the enemy as a sacrifice to win
the aid of the gods for Rome; the other consul, Titus Manlius Torquatus,
beheaded Ills son for winning an engagement by disobeying orders .
81</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>depleted army to Sicily. He relieved the Carthaginian siege of
Syracuse and drove the Carthaginians from nearly all their possessions
on the island; but his imperious rule offended the Sicilian Greeks, who
thought they could have freedom without order and courage; they withdrew
their support, and Pyrrhus returned to Italy, saying of Sicily, “What a
prize I leave to be</p>
<p>fought for by Carthage and Rome!” His army met the Romans at Bene -
ventum, where for the first time he suffered defeat (275); the
light-armed and mobile maniples proved superior to the unwieldy
phalanxes, and began a new chapter in military history. Pyrrhus appealed
to his Italian allies for new troops; they refused, doubting his
fidelity and persistence. He re- turned to Epir us, and died an
adventurer’s death in Greece. In that same year (272) Milo betrayed
Tarentum to Rome. Soon all the Greek cities yielded, the Samnites
sullenly surrendered, and Rome was at last, after two centuries of war,
the ruler of Italy.</p>
<p>The conquest was quickly consolidated with colonies, some sent out by
the Latin League, some by Rome. These colonies served many pur- poses:
they relieved unemployment, the pressure of population upon the means of
subsistence, and consequent class strife in Rome; they acted as
garrisons or loyal nuclei amid disaffected subjects, provided outposts
and outlets for Roman trade, and raised additional food for hungry
mouths in the capital; conquests in Italy were completed with the plow
soon after they had been begun by the sword. In these ways hundreds of
Italian towns that still live today received their foundation or their
Romanization. The Latin language and culture were spread throughout a
peninsula still largely polyglot and barbarous, and Italy was slowly
forged into a united state. The first step had been taken in a political
synthesis brutal in execution, majestic in result.</p>
<p>But in Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Africa, closing the western
Medi- terranean to Roman trade, and imprisoning Italy in her own seas,
stood a power older and richer than Rome.</p>
