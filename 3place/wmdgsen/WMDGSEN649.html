<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>XThe Restoration</p>
<p>1660 — 85</p>
<p>I. THE HAPPY KING</p>
<p>O N May 29, 1660, exactly thirty years after his birth, Charles II
entered London amid such popular rejoicing as exceeded anything in
Eng-</p>
<p>land’s memory. Twenty thousand men of the city militia escorted him,
flaunting their banners and brandishing their swords, through streets
strewn with flowers, hung with tapestry, noisy with trumpets and bells
and hailing cries, and lined with half the population of the town. “I
stood in the</p>
<p>If he had taken any problem very seriously in those triumphant days,
the difficulties bequeathed to him would have darkened his honeymoon.
The cash in the Exchequer amounted to £ 11 , 2s. iod. The government was
in debt by two million pounds. The army and navy were several years
behind in pay. England was at war with Spain. Dunkirk was precariously
held at a cost of £ 100,000 per annum. Ten thousand Cavaliers who had
fought for Charles I, and had been despoiled by Cromwell, begged for
com- pensation. Ten thousands patriots petitioned for sinecures. Charles
said Yes recklessly, and trusted Parliament to find funds.</p>
<p>Parliament too was happy. Its first mood was one of ecstatic
submission to the restored monarchy: “We submit and oblige ourselves and
our poster - ities to your Majesty forever.” 3 The House of Commons
voted “that</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>2 45</p>
<p>the amused monarch to receive his absolution. 4 The Commons felt
added guilt for having assembled without the summons or consent of the
King; it called itself humbly a “Convention” until Charles eased its
conscience by declaring it a legitimate Parliament. 5 These ceremonies
over, the Parliament annulled all such legislation of the Long
Parliament as had not received the consent of Charles I; but it
reaffirmed those concessions which that King had made to Parliament,
including its own supremacy in all matters of taxation; and these
concessions were confirmed by Charles II. Parliament shared with the
King in a crucial victory of the civil power over the mili- tary: the
arrears of pay due the army that for a decade had ruled England were
paid; the forty thousand men disbanded and went home.</p>
<p>Charles had agreed to pardon all his enemies except those that
Parliament should exclude from amnesty. Parliament spent weeks debating
whom to spare and whom to kill. On July 27, 1660, the King went to the
House of Lords and pleaded for an early and merciful decision:</p>
<p>My Lords, if you do not join with me in extinguishing this fear,</p>
<p>which keeps the hearts of men awake . . . , you keep me from per-</p>
<p>forming my promise, which if I had not made, I am persuaded neither
you nor I had been now here. I knew well there had been some men who
could neither forgive themselves, or be forgiven by us; and I</p>
<p>thank you for your justice towards those — the immediate murderers of
my father; but — I will deal truly with you — I never thought of</p>
<p>excepting any others 〔from the amnesty〕 . . . This mercy and
in-</p>
<p>dulgence is the best way to bring men to a true repentance … It will
make them good subjects to me, and good friends and neighbors to you.
0</p>
<p>Parliament wished for a wider vengeance, but Charles insisted that
pardon should be offered to all except those who had signed the death
sentence of his father. 7 Of these a third were dead, a third had fled;
twenty-eight were arrested and tried; fifteen were condemned to life
imprisonment, thirteen were hanged, drawn, and quartered (October 13-17,
1660). Thomas Har- rison, the first to suffer, “looking as cheerful,”
noted eyewitness Pcpys, “as any man could do in that condition,” spoke
bravely from the scaffold, say - ing that his course in voting for the
death of Charles I had been dictated by God. 8 “He was presently cut
down,” says Pcpys, “and his head and heart shown to the people, at which
there were great shouts of joy.” 0 On Decem - ber 8 Parliament ordered
that the corpses of Cromwell, Ireton, and John Bradshaw should be
exhumed from Westminster Abbey and be hanged; it was so done on January
30, 1661, as a way of celebrating the anniversary of Charles Vs death.
The heads were exposed for a day on top of West- minster Hall (where
Parliament met), and then the remains were buried in</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xa pit under the gallows of Tyburn; all of which made John Evelyn
rejoice at “the stupendous and inscrutable judgments of God.” 10 Another
victim, Harry Vane, once governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, was
hanged (1662) for having been instrumental in procuring the execution of
Straf- ford. In this case the King’s mercy slept; he had promised to
spare popular “Sir Harry,” but the prisoner’s boldness at trial hardened
the royal heart.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1660, the Convention Parliament dissolved itself to
make way for elections to a more representative delegation. In the
interim the government faced the only hostile demonstration that
questioned its pop- ularity in the capital. It had done nothing to
silence the religious sects that still hoped for a republican regime;
Presbyterian, Anabaptist, Independent, and Fifth Monarchy divines
preached hotly against the monarchy, and predicted that God’s vengeance
would fall upon it soon in earthquakes, or sheets of blood, or swarms of
toads invading the houses of royal magistrates. On Sunday, January 6 ,
1661, while the King was at Portsmouth seeing his beloved sister
Henrietta off to France, a wine cooper, Thomas Venner, raised the cry of
revolt in a congregation of Fifth Monarchy “saints.” His excited hearers
armed themselves, ran through the streets crying out that only Jesus
should be king, and slew all who resisted them. For two days and nights
the city was in terror, for the Saints scattered in all directions,
killing heartily; until at last a small company of guards, which the
confident government had relied upon to keep order, rounded up the
raiders and led them to the gallows. Charles, returning in haste to his
capital, organized new regiments to police it.</p>
<p>On April 23, feast of England’s patron St. George, the happy King was
crowned in Westminster Abbey, with all the solemn gorgeous ceremony so
precious to monarchy and so dear to the people; and the restored Ang-
lican hierarchy took care to impress upon their anointed rake his
obligation to defend the faith and the Church. On May 8 the new
“Cavalier Parlia - ment” convened, so called because its majority was
more royalist than the King, and lusted for revenge against the
Puritans. Charles had difficulty in dissuading it from resuming the
slaughter of his father’s enemies. It re - stored, theoretically, much
of the royal prerogative that had been lost by Charles I: no legislation
was to be valid except with the consent of both Houses and the King; and
he was to have supreme command of England’s armed forces on land or sea.
It re-established the House of Lords, and re- turned to that chamber the
bishops of the Established Church; but it refused to renew the Star
Chamber or the Court of High Commission, and the right of habeas corpus
was retained. Cavalier properties confiscated under Cromwell were
restored, with little compensation to the purchasers. The old
aristocracy regained wealth and power; the dispossessed families turned
against the Stuarts, and later joined with the gentry and the middle
classes</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>to form the Whigs against the Tories. Charles, in the first half of
his reign, was too lackadaisical to assert any absolute authority; he
allowed the Cava- lier Parliament to continue for seventeen years
despite his legal right to dismiss it; in practice he was a
constitutional king. The essential result of the Rebellion (1642-49),
the passage of supremacy from king to Parliament, and from the Lords to
the Commons, survived the Restoration despite the theoretical absolutism
of the Crown.</p>
<p>It was the good fortune of Parliament that Charles had no liking
for</p>
<p>government. He behaved as if, after fourteen years of wandering and
hardship, he had now been granted by Providence the right to be happy,
and had been admitted to a Mohammedan Paradise. Sometimes he labored at
affairs of state; his negligence of them has been exaggerated; 11 and
toward the end of his reign the nation was surprised to see him take
direct charge and acquit himself with skill and resolution. But in these
honeymoon years he delegated to Edward Hyde, whom he made Earl of
Clarendon in 1661, the administration of the government and even the
determination of policy.</p>
<p>The character of the King entered influentially into the manners,
morals, and politics of the age. He was predominantly French in
parentage and education. His mother was French; his father was the
great-grandson of Mary of Guise or Lorraine; add to this a Scottish, a
Danish, and an Italian grandparent^ and we get a rich but perhaps
unstable mixture. From his sixteenth to his thirtieth year he had lived
on the Continent, where he learned French ways, and saw them at their
best in his sister Henrietta Anne. His dark hair and skin remembered his
Italian grandmother, Marie de Medicis; his temperament was Latin, like
that of his great-grandmother Mary Queen of Scots; his sensual lips, his
shining eyes, his long intrusive nose, and perhaps his taste for women,
came from his Gascon grandfather, Henry of Navarre.</p>
<p>Sexually he was the most scandalous leader of his time, for his
example set loose the looseness of his court, of London society, and of
the Restora- tion theater. We know thirteen of his mistresses by name.
When, aged eighteen, he came from Holland to England to fight for his
father, he found time to beget, by the “brown, beautiful, bold” Lucy
Walter, a boy who grew up as James Scott, whom he later acknowledged as
his son and made Duke of Monmouth. Lucy followed Charles to the
Continent and served him faithfully, apparently with some now nameless
aides. Soon after oc- cupying the royal palace he called Barbara Palmer
to comfort his weariness. As Barbara Viiliers she had set London agog
with her beauty. At eighteen (1659) she married Roger Palmer, who became
Earl of Castlemaine. At nineteen she found the King’s bed, and soon won
such domination over his complaisant spirit that he gave her an
apartment in Whitehall, lavished great sums upon her, and allowed her to
sell political appointments and to</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xinfluence the fate of ministers. She bore three sons and two
daughters, whom he acknowledged as his own. He had his doubts, however,
for amid her royal devotions she carried on liaisons with other men. 12
Her piety grew with her promiscuity. In 1663 she announced her
conversion to Catholicism. Her relatives sought the King to dissuade
her, but he told them that he never meddled with the souls of the
ladies. 18</p>
<p>In 1661 Charles thought it time to marry. From many suitors he chose
Catherine of Braganza, daughter of John IV of Portugal, for she was</p>
<p>offered to him with a dowry providentially fitted to the needs of a
spend- thrift ruler and a merchant state: £ 500, °°o in cash, the port
of Tangier, the isle and (then small) city of Bombay, and free trade
with all Portu- guese possessions in Asia and America. In return England
pledged aid to maintain the independence of Portugal. When the precious
Infanta reached Portsmouth Charles was on hand to greet her; they were
married (May 21,</p>
<ol start="1662" type="1">
<li>at first by Roman Catholic rites, then by Anglican. He wrote to her
mother that he was “the happiest man in the world,” and he bore
gallantly with her train of hoopskirted ladies and solemn monks. She
fell in love with him at first touch. Everything went well for some
weeks; but in July Lady Castlemaine gave birth to a boy, at whose
christening Charles stood godfather — another case of taking God’s name
in vain. Having left her husband, Barbara was now completely dependent
upon the King. She begged him not to desert her; he yielded, and soon
resumed relations with her, with the most scandalous fidelity.
Forgetting his usual good manners, he publicly presented Barbara to his
wife. Catherine bled at the nose with humiliation, swooned, and was
carried from the room. Clarendon, at Charles’s urging, explained to her
that adultery was a royal privilege, recog - nized as such by the best
families on the Continent. In time the Queen ad- justed herself to her
consort’s Oriental ways. Once, visiting him and</li>

<p>seeing a tiny slipper beside his bed, she graciously withdrew lest

<p>the brains of it out before the King’s face. He tells me that the

<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>*49</p>
<p>and court were never in the world so bad as they are now for gaming,
whoring, and drinking, and the most abominable vices that were ever in
the world; so that all must come to naught. 16</p>
<p>By 1668 Charles was tiring of La Castlemaine’s tantrums. On one o f
his last visits to her he interrupted John Churchill, the future Duke of
Marl- borough, who, according to Bishop Burnet, jumped from the window
to avoid a scene with the King. 16 Charles made her Duchess of
Cleveland, and supported her, with the public money, to the end of her
career.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to relate that one woman apparently repulsed the royal
rooster: Frances Stewart, who was credited with “the finest face that
per - haps was ever seen”; 17 “It was hardly possible,” said Anthony
Hamilton , “for a woman to have less wit or more beauty.” 18 The King
continued to importune her even after she had married the Duke of
Richmond. Pepys describes him as rowing alone at night to Somerset
House, “and there, the garden door not being open, himself clambered
over the wall to make a visit to her, which is a horrid shame!” 19</p>
<p>In 1668 Charles saw Nell Gwynn acting at the Drury Lane Theatre.</p>
<p>Bora and bred in the lowest poverty, entertaining tavern drinkers
with her songs, selling oranges in the theater, taking minor parts,
rising to leading roles in comedies, she kept through all her career a
spontaneity of good spirits and good will that charmed the blase King.
She made no difficulties about becoming his mistress; she drew large
sums from his ailing purse, but she spent much of these in charity. Soon
she had to compete with a siren sent from France (1671) to keep Charles
toeing the French and Catholic line: Louise de Keroualle, whose
aristocratic airs Nell mimicked impishly. All the world knows how, when
the London populace mistook Nell for her Catholic rival and jeered her,
she put her pretty head out of the coach window and cried: “Be silent,
good people; I am the Protestant whore.” 20 She continued to share
Charles’s fav or to the end of his life, and was in his thoughts at his
death. La Keroualle, soon made Duchess of Portsmouth, angered London
because she was looked upon as a very expensive French agent, draining
the King of forty thousand pounds a year, amassing jew- elry, and living
in such luxury as turned honest John Evelyn’s stomach. 21 Her reign
ended in 1676, when Charles discovered Hortense Mancini, the vivacious
niece of Cardinal Mazarin.</p>
<p>Charles had other faults. In his youthful misfortunes he had lost all
faith in humanity, and judged all men and women as La Rochefoucauld
described them. Hence he was scarcely capable of devotion — except to
his sister — but lost himself in infatuations; and no sincere and
lasting friendship cast any substantial glow upon the shallow brilliance
of his life. He sold his country as readily as he bought women. He set
his court the example of</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xgambling for great sums. Despite the careless charm of his manners
he showed at times a lack of delicacy that could hardly have been found
in his father; so, for example, he drew Gramont’s attention to the fact
that his household attendants served him on bended knee . 22 He was not
often drunk, but was “horribly” so a few days after the issuance of an
edict against drunkenness . 23 He was usually tolerant of criticism, but
when Sir John Coventry, overstepping bounds, asked in open Parliament
“whether</p>
<p>And yet there were very few who could help liking him. Not since the
youth of Henry VIII had an English king been so popular with his court.
His physical vitality was ingratiating. There was no meanness in him; he
was considerate, kind, and generous; even after paying his courtesans he
found means for charity. He made his park a sanctuary for diverse
animals, and saw that no harm came to them. His favorite spaniel slept,
mated, lit- tered and gave suck in the King’s bedchamber . 25 He put on
no airs, was affable and approachable, and quickly set his interlocutors
at their ease. Everyone but Coventry agreed in speaking of him as “the
good -natured king .” 26 Gramont reckoned him “of all men one of the
most mild and gentle .” 27 According to Aubrey he was “the pattern of
courtesy .” 28 He had polished his manners in France, and, like Louis
XIV, he doffed his hat to the lowliest women. He was far ahead of his
nation in tolerance of diverse opinions and faiths. He drank to the
health of his political opponents, and delighted in satire even when of
himself. His sense of humor was the delight of the court. Pepys
describes him as leading an old country dance called “Cuckolds All
Awry.” His merrymaking was only briefly interrupted by news of plague,
fire, bankruptcy, or war.</p>
<p>His mind was not profound, but there was remarkably little nonsense
in it. He disposed of a man who claimed to tell fortunes by taking him
to the races and noting that he lost three times in succession. He had a
keen interest in science, made experiments, gave a charter and gifts to
the Royal Society, and attended several of its meetings. He had no
particular interest in literature, but much in art, and treasured his
Raphaels, Titians, and Hol- beins. His conversation had much of the
vivacity and variety of that of the cultured circles in France; he
talked well of poetry with Dryden, of music with Purcell, of
architecture with Wren, and was a discriminating patron in all these
fields. There must have been a great deal to be loved in a man whose
sister, on her deathbed, said of him, “I have loved him better than life
i tself, and now my only regret in dying is to be leaving him .” 29</p>
<p>CHAP. EX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>251</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE RELIGIOUS CALDRON</li>
</ol>
<p>Did he have any religion? His life suggests the same attitude that we
find in many contemporary Frenchmen, who lived as atheists and died as
Cath- olics; this seemed to get the best of both worlds, and to be a
great improve- ment on Pascal’s “wager.” “His sense of religion was so
small,” said Burnet, “that he did not so much a s affect the hypocrite,
but at prayers and sacra- ments let everyone, by his negligent behavior,
see how little he thought himself concerned in these matters.” 30 “My
Lord, my Lord,” said a preacher</p>
<p>Probably he was a skeptic with a leaning toward Catholicism;
i.e.,</p>
<p>doubting the theologies, he preferred Catholicism for its colorful
ritual, its marriage with the arts, its lenience to the flesh, and its
support of mon- archy. He had probably forgotten that the Catholic
League and some Jesuit fathers had sanctioned regicide. He remembered
that English Cath- olics had fought for his father, that a third of the
nobles who had died for Charles I were Catholics, 86 that the Irish
Catholics had persisted in loyalty to the Stuarts, and that a Catholic
government had supported him in his long exile. His generally
sympathetic spirit inclined him to desire some mitigation of England’s
anti - Catholic laws, which, in Hallam’s judgment, “were highly severe,
in some cases sanguinary.” 87 He did not share the English Protestant’s
memory of the Gunpowder Plot (1605), or dread of subjection to the
Inquisition and to Rome. He took no offense at the open adherence of his
brother — and presumptive heir — to the Catholic faith. We may judge
from his deathbed conversion that he too would have professed
Catholicism if that had been politically practical.</p>
<p>So, as an amiable politician, he accepted and supported the Anglican
Church. It had been loyal to his father, who had died in its defense; it
had suffered under Cromwell; it had worked for the Restoration. Charles
took for granted that some religion should receive state sanction and
aid as an</p>
<p>2 5 i</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xagent of education and social order. He was constitutionally
horrified by Puritanism; besides, it had had a fair chance at
government, and had proved too severe and unpopular. He could not forget
that the Presbyterians had imprisoned, and the Puritans had beheaded,
his father, and that he himself had been forced to accept their creed,
and to apologize for the sins of his parents. He signed as obviously
just the act of the Convention Parliament restoring to their parishes
the Anglican clergymen who had been dispos- sessed by the Commonwealth.
Nevertheless, he had promised “liberty to tender consciences,” and that
no man should be “disquieted” for pe aceable diversities of religious
belief. In October, 1660, he proposed a compre- hensive toleration of
all Christian sects, even mitigating the laws against Catholics, but the
Presbyterians and the Puritans, fearing this relaxation, joined with the
Anglicans in rejecting the plan. To reconcile Presbyterians and
Anglicans he suggested a compromise liturgy, and a limited episcopacy in
which bishops would be assisted and advised by elected presbyters; Par-
liament vetoed the idea. The “Savoy Conference” of twelve bishops and
twelve Presbyterian divines (1661) reported to the King that “they could
not come to an harmony.” 38</p>
<p>It was a lost opportunity, for the new Parliament was overwhelmingly
Anglican. It opened old wounds by re-establishing episcopacy in Scotland
and Ireland; it restored ecclesiastical courts for the punishment of
“blas - phemy” and nonpayment of tithes to the Anglican Church; it made
the Anglican Book of Common Prayer obligatory on all Englishmen; by the
“Corporation Act” (Novemb er 20, 1661) it disqualified from public
office all persons who had not received the sacrament according to the
Anglican rite before the election; and by the “Act of Uniformity” (May
19, 1662) it required all clergymen and teachers to take an oath of
nonresistance to the King, and to declare their full assent to the Book
of Common Prayer. Clergymen who rejected these conditions were to vacate
their livings by August 24. Some twelve hundred so refused, and were
ejected. These, and the eight hundred already displaced by restored
Anglicans, joined, with a great part of the congregations, the swelling
body of “Sects” or “Dissenters” who finally compelled the Act of
Toleration of 1689.</p>
<p>Charles tried to modify the Act of Uniformity by asking Parliament to
let him exempt from the loss of their benefices those ministers whose
only objections were to the wearing of the surplice, or the use of the
cross in baptism; the Lords agreed, the Commons refused. He sought to
soften the blow by delaying the execution of the act for three months;
this too was frustrated. On December 26, 1662, he issued a declaration
announcing his intention to exempt from the penalties of the act
peaceable persons whose consciences prevented them from taking the
required oath; but Parliament distrusted and rejected this appeal as
implying the power of the King to</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>*53</p>
<p>“dispense” from obedience to the laws. Charles indicated his feelings
by releasing imprisoned Quakers (August 22, 1662), and by confirming re-
ligious toleration in the charters that he granted to Rhode Island and
Carolina, and in his instructions to the governors of Jamaica and
Virginia.</p>
<p>Parliament felt that such toleration should have no place in England.
To end Quaker “conventicles” it defined these as meetings of more than
five persons additional to the members of a household; and it ruled
(1662) that any person attending such an assembly should be fined five
pounds or suffer three months’ imprisonment for the first offense, ten
pounds or six months for the second, banishment to convict plantations
for the third. Offenders unable to pay the cost of their transportation
to the colonies were to serve five years as indentured laborers; and
transported convicts who escaped or returned to England before the
expiration of their terms were to be put to death. In 1664 these
measures were extended to Presbyterians and Inde- pendents. The “Five
Mile Act” of 1665 forbade nonjuring ministers to reside within five
miles of any corporate town, or to teach in any school, public or
private. These laws came to be called the Clarendon Code because they
were enforced by the King’s chief minister against the express wishes of
the sovereign. Charles accepted this harsh legislation because he was
appealing to Parliament for funds, but he never forgave Clarendon, and
lost respect for the bishops who, so soon after being restored, proved
so hard in vengeance and poor in charity. Charles concluded that
“Presbyterianism is no religion for a gentleman, and Anglicanism is no
religion for a Chris- tian.” 80</p>
<p>The Anglican Church, recognizing its dependence upon the monarchy,
reasserted more positively than ever the divine right of kings, and the
mortal sinfulness of resistance to an established royal government. In
1680 Sir Robert Filmcr’s Patriarcha, or The Natural Power of Kings
Asserted, reached publication, twenty-seven years after his death, and
became the standard defense of the doctrine. In the “Judgement and
Decree” of Ox - ford (1683) leading divines of the Anglican Church
declared it “false,</p>
<p>seditious, and impious, even heretical and blasphemous” (and
therefore a capital crime) to hold that “authority is derived from the
people, that if lawful governors become tyrants, they forfeit the right
of governing, that the King hath but co-ordinate right with the other
two estates, the Lords and the Commons”; and it added that “passive
obedience is the badge and character of the Church of England.” 40 This
proved to be an uncomfortable doctrine when, two years later, James II
tried to make England Catholic.</p>
<p>The restored Anglican clergy, despite its intolerance, had many
admir- able qualities. It allowed a wide latitude of theological opinion
within its own membership, from Laudians (later known as “High
Churchmen”) who approached Catholic doctrine and liturgy, to
Latitudinarians (latef</p>
<p>2 54</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>X“Broad Churchmen”) who sympathized with a liberal theology, stressed
the moral rather than the doctrinal element in Christianity, discouraged
persecution, and sought to reconcile Puritans, Presbyterians, and
Anglicans. Charles supported these “men of latitude,” and appreciated
the comparative brevity of their sermons. 41 Greatest of these liberal
theologians was John Tillotson, whom Charles made his chaplain, and whom
William III made Archbishop of Canterbury (1691), “a man of clear head
and sweet tem - per,” 42 who opposed “popery,” atheism, and persecution
with equal ardor, and dared to rest Christianity on reason. “We need not
desire any better evidence that a man is in the wrong,” he said, “than
to hear him declare</p>
<p>The Puritans suffered now not merely political persecution but a
social contumely in which they were the butt of those whose easy morals
had been inconvenienced under the Puritan regime. They bore with courage
this turn of the wheel. Some migrated to America, many took the required
oaths. Their finest figure in this age was Richard Baxter, a man of
reasonable temper who was willing to accept any compromise that would
not impair his fiery theology. Though faithful to Puritan ideology to
the end, he con- demned the execution of Charles I and the absolutism of
Cromwell, and favored the Restoration. After 1662 he was prohibited from
preaching, and was repeatedly arrested for violating the prohibition. He
was one of the most enlightened of the Puritans, yet he applauded the
burning of witches in Salem, Massachusetts, and thought of his God in
terms that made Moloch seem amiable. Who are the saved? “They are,” said
Baxter, “a small part of lost mankind, whom God hath from eternity
predestined to this rest.” 44 He emphasized, in his sermons, t he
tortures of hell, whose “principal author is God Himself. . . . The
torments of the damned,” he wrote, “must be ex - treme, because they are
the effect of the divine vengeance. Wrath is terrible, but revenge is
implacable.” 45 He forbade sexual interc ourse except to have offspring
with a lawful mate; and if this restriction required stoic self-con-
trol, he recommended cold baths and a vegetable diet to moderate erotic
desire. 48 We almost forgive his theology when we see him, aged
seventy</p>

<p>(1685), standing trial before the brutal Judge Jeffreys for having
uttered a few words against Anglican pretensions; he was denied all
chance to de- fend or explain himself, and was sentenced to pay five
hundred marks or remain in jail till the full sum should be paid. 47 He
was freed after eighteen months, but he never recovered his health.</p>
<p>The Quakers continued to suffer arrest and confiscation of property
for refusing to take oaths, or avoiding Anglican services, or holding
illegal assemblies. In 1662 there were over 4,200 of them in English ja
ils. “Some of them were crowded into prisons so close that there was not
room for all of them to sit down. . . . They were refused straw to lie
upon; they were often denied food.” 48 Their patience and persistence
finally won the battle; the persecutions diminished in fact if not in
law. In 1672 Charles freed twelve hundred of them; 49 and in 1682 his
brother James, Duke of York, gave to the Scottish Quaker Robert Barclay,
the rich Friend William Penn, and some associates a patent for the
province of East Jersey in America.</p>
<p>Penn was the son of the Admiral William Penn who had captured</p>
<p>Jamaica for England. When the boy was twelve he went through various
stages of religious excitement, during which he was so “suddenly
surprised with an inward comfort and … an external glory in the room,
that he has many times said that from thence he had the seal of divinity
and im- mortality,” the conviction “that there was a God, and that the
soul of man was capable of enjoying His divine communication.” 50 A t
Oxford he was fined and expelled for refusing to attend Anglican
services (1661). Return- ing to his father, he was whipped and turned
out of doors for his avowed Quakerism. The relenting father sent him to
France to learn la gaiete Parisienne-, there, perhaps, Penn acquired
some of his courtly ways. In 1666 he had so far reconciled himself with
sin as to serve in the army in Ireland, but a year later he attended a
Quaker meeting in Cork, took fire again, expelled a heckling soldier,
and was arrested. From his prison he wrote to the lord president of
Munster a plea for freedom of worship. Re- turning to England, he burned
his bridges behind him, became a Quaker preacher, was again and again
arrested. His trial in 1 669 played a role in the history of English
law. The jury acquitted him; the judge fined and im- prisoned the jury
for contumacy; the jurors appealed to the Court of Com- mon Pleas,
which, by unanimously declaring that they had been unlawfully arrested,
vindicated the right and power of juries in England. However, Penn was
jailed for refusing to remove his hat in court. He was released in time
to be present at his father’s death (1670), which left him a fortune of
fifteen hundred pounds a year, and a claim on the Crown for sixteen
thousand pounds lent by his father to Charles II. Reimprisoned for
preach- ing, he wrote in jail his most eloquent defense of toleration,
The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience (1671). In an interval of
freedom he married</p>
<p>25 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xa wealthy woman, and bought an interest in the western half of what
is now the state of New Jersey. For this colony he wrote (1677) a
constitu- tion assuring religious toleration, jury trial, and popular
government; but control passed out of his hands, and the full provisions
of the constitution were not applied.</p>
<p>In 1677 Penn, George Fox, Robert Barclay, and George Keith crossed
the Channel t o preach Quakerism on the Continent. Some of Penn’s con -
verts from Kirchheim founded Germantown in Pennsylvania, and were among
the first to declare it wrong for Christians to have slaves. Back in
England, Penn took the lead in keeping the Quakers from joining the
persecution of Catholics for the “Popish Plot”; his Address to
Protestants</p>
<p>The passive resistance of the Quakers to persecution was the
strongest force making for religious toleration in this intolerant age.
A Dissenter estimated that there were sixty thousand arrests for
religious nonconformity between 1660 and 1688, and that five thousand of
those so arrested died in jail. 51 The intolerance of Parliament was
worse than the immorality of the court or the stage. “In this crucial
period,” said one who wrote history almost as well as he made it, “the
King was almost the only modern and merciful voice . . . Throughout his
reign he consistently strove for tolera- tion.” 52 When (1669) three men
were sentenced under an old Elizabethan law to forfeit a large sum to
the Crown for failing to attend Anglican services, Charles pardoned the
fines, and declared that he would not have this statute enforced
hereafter, “it being his judgment that no one ought to suffer merely for
conscience’ sake.” 58</p>
<p>More Englishmen would have agreed with him had they not suspected him
of wishing to relieve the disabilities of English Catholics; and England
was still so fearful of papal domination, Spanish Inquisitions, and
govern- ment by priests, that Presbyterians and Puritans preferred to
have their own worship outlawed rather than permit the Catholic worship
in England. The English Catholics were at this time approximately five
per cent of the</p>

<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>population. 64 Politically they were impotent, but the Queen was a
Catholic, and the King’s brother made little attempt to conceal his
conversion (1668). By that time there were 266 Jesuits in England, one
of them a bastard son of Charles, and they were beginning to appear
confidently in public despite the most stringent laws. Catholic schools
were being set up in private homes. England worried. Annually the
Protestants celebrated an antipopery parade, carrying to Smithfield, and
there Joyously burning, effigies of the pope and the cardinals. They had
not forgotten Guy Fawkes. But the Catholics waited hopefully. At any
moment now a Catholic would be king.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE ENGLISH ECONOMY: 1660-1702</li>
</ol>
<p>The population of England and Wales in 1660 has been estimated at
some 5 ,000,000 ; 56 probably it grew to 5,500,000 by 1700; 56 still it
was hardly a fourth the population of France or Germany, and less than
that of Italy or Spain. 57 About a seventh of the inhabitants — the
yeomanry — owned the lands that they tilled; tenant farmers working the
lands of nobility and gentry made up another seventh. The rest were in
the towns.</p>
<p>As population rose, the supply of wood per family fell; coal was</p>
<p>increasingly used in homes and shops; mining and metallurgy
developed; Sheffield became a center of the iron industry. A fever of
production and moneymaking agitated England. Manufacturers begged
Parliament to pass laws forcing idlers to work. Domestic industry,
particularly textiles, used more and more child labor; Defoe rejoiced
that at Colchester and Taunton “there was not a child in th e town, or
in the villages round it, of above five years old, but, if it was not
neglected by its parents and untaught, could earn its bread”; and
likewise around West Riding “hardly anything above four years old but
its hands were sufficient for its support.” 58</p>
<p>Most industry was carried on in homes or family shops, but the
factory system was expanding in textiles and iron. An English
publication of 1685 told how “manufacturers at great cost build wh ole
great houses, wherein the wool sorters, combers, spinners, weavers,
pressers, and even dyers work together.” We hear of one such factory
with 340 employees; in 1700 Glasgow had a textile factory employing
1,400 persons. 59 Division and specializati on of labor were developing.
“In the making of a watch,” wrote Sir William Petty in 1683, “if one man
shall make the wheels, another the spring, another shall engrave the
dial plate, and another shall make the cases, then the watch will be
better and cheaper made than if the whole work be put upon any one man.”
60</p>
<p>Wages for agricultural labor were still fixed by local magistrates
accord- ing to the Elizabethan Statute of Apprentices (1585), and any
employer</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>X2 5 8</p>
<p>who paid, or any employee who took, more, was subject to penalty.
Agricultural wages in this period ranged from five to seven shillings
per week, with board. 61 Wages in industry were slightly higher,
averaging a shilling per day, perhaps equal in purchasing power to .50
in i960. Rents were relatively low; a house of moderate size in London
cost some thirty pounds a year. 62 Beer was cheap, but sugar, salt,
coal, soap, shoes, and clothing cost as much in 1685 as in 1848. 63 The
price of grain rose five hundred per cent between 1500 and 1700. 64 The
working classes ate bread of rye, barley, or oats; wheat bread was a
luxury of the well-to-do; and the poor seldom had meat. The poverty of
the masses was taken as a normal condition, though it was probably
greater than in the later Middle Ages. 68 So Thorold Rogers:</p>
<p>During the seventeenth century the landlords strove to get all
the</p>
<p>rent they could out of their tenants. To the utmost of their
power</p>
<p>they forced famine wages on the laborer. To the utmost of their</p>
<p>power they used the legislature in order to secure famine prices from
the consumer. . . . The historical evidence on this subject is
cumulative and abundant. 66</p>
<p>In 1696 Gregory King estimated that a fourth of England’s population
was dependent upon alms, and the money collected for poor relief equaled
a quarter of the whole export trade. 67 The triumph of the rich over the
poor was so complete that the wage earners and peasants were too weak to
revolt; and for half a century the class war in England slept. 68</p>
<p>The Anglican Church, which under Charles I had dared to say an</p>
<p>occasional word for the poor, now concluded, from the Puritan
Rebellion, that its interests would be best assured by identifying them
entirely with those of the possessing classes. 69 Parliament belonged to
a coalition of land- owners, manufacturers, merchants, and financiers.
It listened with fellow feeling to the cry of the employing class to be
liberated from the laws impeding the free play of economic forces.
Before the end of the seventeenth century — long before Adam Smith —
England heard the employers’ cry for laissez faire, for economic
freedom, for the escape of the businessman from legal, feudal, and guild
hindrances in employment, production, and trade. 70 The guild restraints
were bypassed; the institution of apprentice- ship decayed; the fixing
of wages by magistrates was superseded by the relative bargaining power
of rich employers and hungry employees. 71 It was in this clamor of
entrepreneurs to be freed from legal and moral restraints that the
modern ideology of liberty began.</p>
<p>Commerce was now so important in the English economy, and so vital in
earning the funds that Parliament voted, that it soon had its way even
with a government dominated by landowners. Legislation favored
English</p>

<p>trade at the expense not only of the Dutch but of the Irish and the
Scots. The importation of Irish cattle, sheep, or swine into England was
totally prohibited (1660); Scottish corn was excluded, and Scottish
imports were heavily taxed. The alliance with Portugal, the marriage of
Charles II with Catherine of Braganza, the renewed war with the United
Provinces, the resolute retention of Gibraltar, were actuated by the
desire to expand English commerce and give it military protection.
Partly as a result of victory over the Dutch, English commerce doubled
between 1660 and</p>
<ol start="1688" type="1">
<li>72 “The thing which is nearest to the heart of this nation,”
wrote</li>
</ol>
<p>English enterprise extended its outposts in every direction. New
colonies were developed in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Carolina,
and Canada. The East India Company was given full rights over all of
India that it could bring under its power; it had its own navy, army,
forts, coinage, and laws; it declared war and negotiated peace. Bombay
was acquired by marriage in 1661, Manhattan by conquest in 1664, and in
that year the English seized Dutch possessions on the west coast of
Africa. To man these colonies the custom of “crimping” grew: young
Englishmen we re inveigled into service in the “plantation” by getting
them drunk, or knocking them unconscious, then carrying them on board a
departing ship, and later ex- plaining to them that they had signed an
indenture. 74 The law forbade this, but was not enforced; the conscience
of Parliament was clear. While the political effect of the revolutions
of 1642-49 and 1688-89 was the conquest of the king by the Parliament, a
simultaneous economic revolution brought the conquest of Parliament by
commerce, industry, and finance.</p>
<p>London had now hundreds of goldsmiths-become-bankers, who paid six
per cent to depositors and charged eight per cent on loans. 76 Charles
II, always seeking ways to bypass the parliamentary power over the
purse, borrowed heavily from these bankers — so much so that by January
2, 1672, he owed them £ 1,328,52 6. 70 On that date his Council, about
to begin war against the United Provinces, shocked the financial
community by “closing the Exchequer” — i.e., stopping for a year all
interest payments on the government’s debts. A panic ensued. The bankers
refused to meet their obligations to their depositors, or to keep their
agreements with merchants. The Council quieted the storm by solemn
pledges to resume payments at the end of a year. They were resumed in
1674; the principal was refunded in new governmental obligations; so
that in effect January 2, 1672, marked the beginning of England’s
national debt, a new device in the financi ng of the state.</p>

of the wealth gathered by the price system from the producers of food

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xgoods, was now the most populous city in Europe. The mansions of the
rich businessmen rivaled the aristocracy in luxury, if not in taste. A
suc- cession of stores, with their picturesque emblems, swaying signs,
and mullioned windows offered to the few the products of the world.*
Only the principal thoroughfares were paved, usually with round
cobblestones; and after 1684 they were dimly lit till midnight on
moonless nights by lanterns set up at every tenth door. There were no
sidewalks. By day the streets were noisy with traffic, with hawkers
peddling their wares in baskets, pushcarts, or wheelbarrows, or criers
offering various household services, such as “rats or mice to kill.” 77
Beggars and thieves were every - where, but there were also street
singers ballading for pence. The business center, called “the City,” was
governed by a lord mayor, a board of aider - men, and a common council,
elected by the householders of the wards. West of this lay the political
center, Westminster — with Westminster Abbey, Westminster Palace (where
Parliament met), and the royal palaces of Whitehall and St. James.
Outside of these lay the slum districts, pullulat- ing with the fertile
poor. There were no pavements there, and coaches proudly splashed with
rain water or mud the pedestrians hugging the walls in narrow streets.
Houses there were so close together, with upper stories almost meeting,
that the sun had little chance to spread its fitful light. There were no
sewers as yet in London; there were outhouses and cesspools; carts
carried off refuse and dumped it beyond the city limits, or
clandestinely and illegally into the Thames.</p>
<p>Air pollution was already a problem. In 1661 John Evelyn, at the
King’s request, prepared and published Fumifugium, a plan for scattering
the fumes that hung over London. Said Evelyn:</p>
<p>The immoderate use of . . . coal . . . exposes London to one of
the</p>
<p>foulest inconveniences and reproaches; and that not from the culinary
fires, which … is hardly at all discernible, but from some few par-</p>
<p>ticular funnels and issues 〔smokestacks〕 belonging only to
brewers,</p>
<p>dyers, lime-burners, salt, and soap-boilers, and some other
private</p>
<p>trades, one of whose spiracles 〔vents〕 alone does manifestly
infest</p>
<p>the air more than all the chimneys of London put together. . . .
While these are belching 〔from〕 their sooty jaws, . . . London
resembles the face rather of Mt. Etna, … or the suburbs of hell, than an
assembly</p>
<p>of rational creatures. . . . The weary tr aveller, at many miles’
distance, sooner smells than sees the city to which he repairs . . .
This acrimoni- ous soot . . . 〔ulcerates〕 the lungs, which is a
mischief so incurable that it carries away multitudes by languishing and
deep consumptions, as the bills of mortality do weekly inform us .

<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>Evelyn prepared a bill for Parliament, which, being more approachable
by rich industrialists than by unorganized majorities, did nothing about
it. Thirteen years later Sir Thomas Browne raised his medical voice
in</p>
<p>warning against the</p>
<p>exhalations of . . . common sewers and fetid places, and
decoctions</p>
<p>used by unwholesome and sordid manufactures. . . . Mists and fog also
hinder the . . . coal smoke from descending and passing away. 〔So〕 it
is conjoined with the mist and drawn in by the breath, all which may
produce bad effects, inquinite 〔defile〕 the blood, and produce
catarrhs and coughs. 79</p>
<p>Bad air, bad sanitation, bad and inadequate food darkened every year
with epidemics, and only waited some conjunction of circumstances to
flare up in plague. Pepys noted in his diary, October 31, 1663: “The p
lague is much in Amsterdam, and we in fears of it here.” Ships coming
from Holland to England were quarantined. In December, 1664, one person
died of the plague in London; in April, 1665, two; in May, forty-three;
so it grew until the hot summer, with little rain to cleanse the
streets, gave the pestilence headway, and London in terror realized that
it faced some- thing like the still remembered Black Death of 1348.
Defoe, then a child of six, could recall enough of it by hearsay in 1720
to write a fictitious Journal of the Plague Year that may almost be
taken as history. 80</p>
<p>From the first week in June the infection spread in a dreadful
man-</p>
<p>ner, and the bills 〔mortality records〕 rose high. . . . All that
could</p>
<p>conceal their distemper did it, to prevent their neighbors shunning .
. . them, and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses. …
In</p>
<p>June . . . the richer sort . . . thronged out of town. … In
Whitechapel</p>
<p>. . . nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women,
children, etc., . . . besides innumerable numbers of men on horse-</p>
<p>back … a terrible and melancholy thing to see. 81</p>
<p>Portents and prophecies of doom added to the terror. Theaters, dance
halls, schools, and law courts were closed. The King and the court re-
moved in June to Oxford, “where it pleased God to preserve them”</p>
<p>untouched, though many voices rose to blame them for having brought
on this plague as a divine punishment of their immorality. The
Archbishop of Canterbury stayed at his post in Lambeth, and spent
several hundred pounds a week caring for the sick or dead. The city
officials remained, and labored heroically. The King sent a thousand
pounds, the businessmen of the City six hundred, a week. Many doctors
and clergymen fled, many remained, many died of the infection. Cures of
every sort were tried; and when these failed, people resorted to
miraculous amulets. “This week,”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xs aid Pepys (August 31, 1665), “died 7,496, and of them 6,102 of the
plague.” Gravediggers carried away in carts those who died in the
streets, and buried them in common ditches. Altogether some seventy
thousand Londoners, a seventh of the population, died of the plague in
1665. By December the pestilence abated. People dribbled back to work.
In February, 1666, the court returned to the capital.</p>
<p>The survivors had hardly time to reconcile themselves to their losses
when another disaster struck the city. It was bad enough that in June,
1666, the Dutch sailed boldly into the Thames and there destroyed</p>
<p>English vessels with broadsides heard in London. But at three o’clock
on the morning of Sunday, September 2, in a ba ker’s shop in Pudding
Lane, a fire began which in three days burned down most of London north
of the river. Again circumstances conspired: a dry summer, the houses
nearly all of wood and close together; many homes left vacant by
families</p>
<p>spending the weekend in the country; stores full of oil, pitch, hemp,
flax, wine, and other readily combustible wares; a strong wind that
carried the fire from roof to roof and from street to street; and the
lack of organization and equipment to deal with such a fire at such a
time of night. Evelyn, fortunate in Southwark, ran up to the
riverbank,</p>
<p>where we beheld . . . the whole city in dreadful flames near the
water side; all the houses from the 〔London〕 Bridge, all Thames
street, and upwards towards Cheapside . . . The conflagration was so
universal, and the people so astonished, that from the beginning, I know
not by what despondency or fate, they hardly stirred to quench it; so
that</p>
<p>there was nothing heard or seen but crying out and lamentation,</p>
<p>running about like distracted creatures. … So it burned the churches,
public halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments, . . .</p>
<p>houses, furniture, and everything. Here we saw the Thames covered
with goods floating, all the barges and boats laden with what some had
time and courage to save, as, on the other side, the carts, etc., carry-
ing out to the fields, which for many miles were strewn with movables of
all sorts, and tents erected to shelter both people and what goods they
could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as
haply the world had not seen since the foundation of it. . . . All the
sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning oven. . . . God</p>
<p>grant my eyes may never behold the like, who now saw above 10,000
homes all in one flame! The noise and cracking and thunder of the</p>
<p>impetuous flames, the shrieking of women and children, the hurry of
people, the fall of towers, houses, and churches was like a hideous</p>
<p>storm; and the air all about so hot . . . that they were forced to
stand still, and let the flames bum on, which they did for nearly two
miles</p>
<p>in length and one in breadth . 82</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>In this crisis both the King and his unpopular brother James
acquitted themselves well, laboring with their own hands among the
firefighters, directing and financing relief, providing food and shelter
for the home- less; and it was their insistence, against much
opposition, on blowing up houses to stop the progress of the fire, that
saved part of the city north of the Thames. 83 The commercial City was
almost wiped out; the political city — Westminster — was saved.
Altogether two thirds of London was destroyed, with 13,200 houses and
eighty-nine churches, including old St. Paul’s. Only six lives were
lost, but 200,000 lost their homes. 84 Most of the</p>
<p>After the disaster the Corporation of London organized a fire
department; fireplugs were placed in the main water pipes; each guild
company was to appoint some of its members to be ready to turn out at
once on alarm; and all workmen were to follow them when called upon by
the lord mayor or the sheriff. Slowly the city was rebuilt, not more
beautifully, but more substantially; by royal order brick or stone
replaced wood as the material of building; projecting upper stories
disappeared; streets were made wider and straighter, they were paved
with smooth freestone, and posts set aside a walk for pedestrians.
Sanitation was improved; the fire had destroyed much filth, many rats,
fleas, and germs; London had no further plagues. A nd Wren rebuilt
St. Paul’s.</p>

<li>ART AND MUSIC: 1660-1702</li>
</ol>
<p>Christopher Wren was bom in religion, nurtured in science, and</p>
<p>completed in art. His father was dean of Windsor, his uncle was
bishop of Ely. He went to Westminster School and to Wadham College,
Oxford. At twenty-one (1653) he was a fellow at All Souls College there;
at twenty- five, professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London; at
twenty-nine, Savile professor of astronomy at Oxford. He seemed absorbed
in science. Mathematics, mechanics, optics, meteorology, astronomy,
fascinated him. He rectified the cycloid (found the straight line
equivalent to the cycloid curve). He demonstrated the laws of impact,
and was credited by Newton with experiments leading to the three laws of
motion. 86 He labored to improve the telescope and the grinding of
lenses. He investigated the rings of Saturn. He invented a device for
turning salt water into fresh water. He performed for Boyle the first
injection of a fluid into the bloodstream of an animal. He proved that
an animal could live comfortably after the removal of its spleen. He
shared with Thomas Willis in dissecting a brain, and made</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xthe drawings for Willis’ Cerebri Anatome. He was one of the first
members of the Royal Society, and wrote the preamble to its charter. No
one</p>
<p>dreamed that he would go down in history as the greatest of English
architects.</p>
<p>Circumstances alter careers. It was probably Wren’s skill in
drawing</p>
<p>that led Charles II to appoint him (1661) assistant to Sir John
Denham, surveyor general of works. Soon he found in architecture that
marriage of science and art, of the true becoming beautiful, which was
the heart and goal of his thought. “There are two kinds of beauty,” he
wrote, “natural and customary. Natural is from geometry. . . . Customary
〔or conventional〕 beauty is begotten by the use 〔habituation〕 of our
senses to those objects that are usually pleasing to us. . . . But
always the true test is natural or geometrical beauty.” 87 The
geometrically correct, he thought, would of itself please us and be
beautiful (like any of the great bridges of the world). From this
standpoint he preferred classic to Gothic architecture, and in his first
designs he followed the lead of Inigo Jones.</p>
<p>In 1663, for Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, he designed the</p>
<p>Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford; here at the outset he adopted classical
principles, raising the circular edifice on lines laid down by Vitruvius
in antiquity and by Vignola in the Renaissance. A long stay in France
(1664-</p>
<ol start="1666" type="1">
<li>confirmed his classical predilections, but his admiration for
Francis Mansart’s Church of Val -de-Grace inclined him to add a degree
of</li>
</ol>
<p>baroque adornment to his fa£ades; and he remembered the dome of Val-
de- Grace when he rebuilt St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>He returned to London in March, 1666. In April, at the request of
Bishop Sheldon, he drew up a plan for repairing the tottering cathedral,
then almost six hundred years old. On August 27 a Commission for the
Repair of St. Paul’s accepted Wren’s plan. Two weeks later the church
was destroyed in the historic fire of London; the melted lead of its
roof ran in the streets.</p>
<p>That conflagration, razing two thirds of the capital, gave
architecture an opportunity unprecedented since the burning of Rome. The
fire was still smoldering when Wren offered to Charles II a majestic
design for rebuilding the city. Charles accepted it, but could not find
funds for it, and it conflicted with powerful property rights. Wren
busied himself with other projects. In 1673 he prepared a classical
design for a new St. Paul’s. The cathedral chapter objected that the
design smacked of a pagan temple, and urged Wren to adhere to the Gothic
style of the old church. He</p>
<p>reluctantly agreed to a compromise by which the interior would have
Gothic arches, transept, and choir, but the facade would be a
Renaissance columnar portico with a classical pediment and two baroque
towers. The result is an unpleasant mixture of styles, but Wren redeemed
it by</p>
<p>crowning the transept with a dome rivaling Brunelleschi’s at Florence
and</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>Michelangelo’s in Rome. St. Paul’s r emains the finest church ever
built by Protestants.</p>
<p>While that project went on through thirty-five years, Wren,
having</p>
<p>succeeded Denham as surveyor general, designed fifty-three other
churches, many of them famous for towers and spires that united his
sense of beauty with his mathematical bent. Add the Custom House in
London, the Green- wich and Chelsea hospitals, the chapels of Pembroke
College at Cambridge and Trinity College at Oxford, the library of
Trinity College at Cambridge, the classical east wing of Hampton Court
Palace, thirty-six guildhalls, a number of private houses, and it seems
that “no building of importance was erected during the last forty years
of the seventeenth century of which Wren was not the architect.” 88
Through the reigns of Charles II, James II, William and Mary, and Anne,
he retained his place as surveyor general. He retired from practice at
eighty-six, but continued for five years more to superintend the work at
Westminster Abbey; and some credit him with its towers. He died in his
ninety- first year, and was buried in St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>Sculpture was still an orphan in England, but wood carving was a
major art. Grinling Gibbons was a worthy collaborator with Wren, carving
the choir stalls and magnificent organ case in St. Paul’s, and
decorations at Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and Hampton Court.</p>
<p>English painting continued to import its masters and discourage its
sons. Nevertheless some have ranked John Riley as the best portrait
painter of the Restoration. He knew that a mature face is an
autobiography; he could read its lines, and between them, with patient
insight, he revealed its secrets with unprofitable courage. He was
almost ruined by Charles II’s comment on Riley’s portrait of him: “Is
that like me? Then, odds fish, I am an ugly fellow!” Much time elapsed
before the court realized that this was a spontaneous compliment to the
artist’s honesty. Riley transmitted with similar fidelity James II the
foolish king, Edmund Waller the turncoat poet, and the Earl of Arundel
the vain aristocrat. But when he painted Christopher Wren and Robert
Boyle he recognized genius, and caught its marks in the face and its
light in the e yes. “With a quarter of Sir Godfrey Kneller’s vanity,”
said Horace Walpole, “Riley might have persuaded the world that he was a
master.” 89 He died in 1691, aged forty -five.</p>
<p>Lely the Dutchman and Kneller the German were the fashionable</p>
<p>portrait painte rs of that second Stuart age. Lely’s father was a
Dutch soldier, van der Faes, whose nickname Lely (from a lily painted on
his house) passed down to his son. Pieter was bom in Westphalia (1618),
studied painting in Haarlem, and took ship to England (1641) on hearing
that Charles I had taste and pounds. He succeeded Vandyck as the most
sought-for portraitist in England, and continued so under Cromwell
and</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XCharles II. He adopted Vandyck’s trick of endowing his sitters
with</p>
<p>elegance, even if only in dress. The beauties of the court besieged
him; so in the National Portrait Gallery we see Nell Gwyn plump and
naughty, and the Countess of Shrewsbury, notorious for her gallantries;
and at Hampton Court Palace Lady Castlemaine and Louise de Keroualle
still flaunt their nipples from the walls. Lovelier is John Churchill
pictured as a child, with his sister Arabella; 90 who would expect this
angelic boy and angelic girl to become the invincible Duke of
Marlborough and the ir- removable mistress of James, Duke of York? Lely
achieved knighthood and riches by such portraits. Charles II and half a
dozen dukes sat for him. Pepys found him “a mighty proud man . . . and
full of state,” 91 living in “pomp and victuals,” 92 and dated three
weeks ahead.</p>
<p>In 1674, six years before Lely’s death, a German arrived in
London,</p>
<p>resolved to succeed Sir Peter in portraiture, profits, and
knighthood; and he accomplished his program. Gottfried von Kneller was
then twenty- eight. Charles II made him court painter, and Kneller kept
that post under James II and William III, who dubbed him knight. Sir
Godfrey painted forty-three members of the politically powerful Kit Cat
Club, 93 and ten sirens of William’ s court, 94 and deprived Dryden and
Locke of character. As everyone itched for immortality, Kneller turned
his luxurious studio into a mass-production factory with an
unprecedented staff of aides, each charged with some specialty — hands,
drapery, lace. Sometimes he took fourteen sitters in a day. He built a
mansion in the country, and commuted between it and his town house in a
coach-and-six. He kept his head on his neck through all political
overturns, and died in bed and honors at seventy- seven ( 1723). In that
year Reynolds was born, Hogarth was twenty-six, and native painting was
coming into its own.</p>
<p>The Puritans had nearly obliterated art, but they had not silenced
music. All but the lowliest homes had some musical instruments. Amid the
great fire Pepys noticed virginals on almost every third boat carrying
salvaged goods on the Thames. 95 “Music and women,” he wrote, “I cannot
but give way to, whatever my business is”; a nd he mentions his
flageolet, lute, theorbo, and “viollin” as frequently as his amours. 96
Everybody in his Diary plays music and sings; he takes it for granted
that his friends can join in part song; 97 he and his wife and their
maids sing in harmony in his garden, and so bearably that neighbors open
their windows to hear them.</p>
<p>In the Restoration jubilation music burst forth in all its forms.
Charles brought in musicians from France, and soon let it be known that
he favored tuneful, cheerful, intelligible compositions that did not
take mathematics for melody. Organs were built again, and rumbled in the
churches of the Establishment; those designed for St. George’s Chapel at
Windsor and the</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>cathedral at Exeter were among the wonders and thunders of the age.
But even in church choirs solemnity was replaced by dramatic displays of
in- strumental virtuosos and vocal soloists. Charles II and James II
ordered music for odes and masques to celebrate royal events; churches
commis- sioned music; theaters ventured on opera. English composers and
performers began to eat again.</p>
<p>In 1656 Sir William Davenant persuaded the Protectorate government to
let him reopen a theater on the ground that he would produce not a play
but an opera. The First Dayes Entertainment that he staged was less an
opera than a series of dialogues preceded, interrupted, and followed by
music; but in that same year Davenant presented, in his own Rutland
House, the first English opera. The Siege of Rhodes . 98 The closing of
the theaters by the plague and the fire interfered with these
experiments, but in 1667 the enterprising Davenant offered a musical
adaptation of his alleged father’s T empest. Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas
marked the full arrival of opera in England.</p>
<p>As so often in musical history, Henry Purcell’s genius was in large
part a product of social heredity — i.e., adolescent environment. His
father was master of the choris ters at Westminster Abbey; his uncle was
“composer in ordinary for the violins to his Majesty”; his brother was a
composer and dramatist, his son and his grandson continued his role as
organist in the Abbey. He himself was allowed only thirty-seven years of
life (1658-95). As a boy he sang in the Chapel Royal till his voice
broke. As a youth he composed anthems that continued to be heard in
English cathedrals for a century. His twelve sonatas (1683), for two
violins and organ or harpsi- chord, brought the sonata form from Italy
to England. His songs, anthems, cantatas, and chamber music, said
Burney, “so far surpassed whatever our country had produced or imported
before, that all other musical composi- tions seem to have been
instantly consigned to contempt or oblivion.” 99</p>
<p>Busy with his work as organist and composer, it was not till .1689
that Purcell produced Dido and Aeneas , for a select audience at a
girls’ school in London. The music, even the famous overture, seems to
us now thin and feeble; we have to remember that opera was still young,
and that audiences did not then have our liking for noise. The final
aria — Dido’s lament, “When I am laid in earth” — is one of the most
moving airs in the whole history of opera.</p>
<p>King Arthur (1691), for which Dry den wrote the words and Purcell the
music, is not quite an opera, since the music seems to have little
relation to the mood or events of the play — just as the play had little
connection with the Arthurian cycle as we know it in Malory and
Tennyson. A year later Purcell made a further advance with incidental
music for The Fairy Queen, an anonymous adaptation of A Midsummer
Night’s Dream. He did</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xnot live to see it produced; the music was lost, was discovered in
1901, and is now ranked with Purcell’s best.</p>
<p>In 1693 he composed the most elaborate of his many odes for
St. Cecilia’s Day. But the finest of these is the joyful Te Deum and
Jubilate of 1694; this was performed annually at the festival of the
Sons of the Clergy till 1713, when it shared the honor with Handel’s
Utrecht Te Deum in alternate</p>
<p>Despite the vitality of the Restoration, English music had not
yet</p>
<p>recovered from the cutting of its Elizabethan traditions by the
Puritan interlude. Instead of rooting itself again in English soil, it
followed the royal lead and bowed to French styles and Italian voices.
After Dido and Aeneas the English operatic stage was dominated by
Italian operas sung by Italians. “English music,” wrote Purcell in 1690,
“is yet but in its nonage, a forward child, which gives hope of what it
may be hereafter . . . when the masters of it shall find more
encouragement.” 100</p>
<p>V. MORALS</p>
<p>Let us at once distinguish the masses from the classes. The sexual
riot of the Restoration ran through the court to the upper middle class
and the “people about town” who frequented the theatres. The morals of
the unrecorded commoners were probably better than under Elizabeth, for
economic routine kept them steady, they did not have the means to be
wicked, and they still felt the stimulus and surveillance of their
Puritan faiths. But in London, and above all at the court, the release
and reaction from Puritan restraints engendered an hilarious
promiscuity. Young aristocrats uprooted from England, and at loose ends
in France, left their morals behind them in their exile, and brought a
fluid chaos with them on their return. Avenging years of oppression and
spoliation, they turned against the dress and speech, the theology and
ethics, of the Puritans all the acid of their wit, until no man of their
class dared say a word for decency. Virtue, piety, and marital fidelity
became forms of rural in- nocence, and the most successful adulterer (as
in Wycherley’s Country Wife) became the hero of the hour. Religion had
literally lost caste; it belonged to tradesmen and peasants; most
preachers were put down as long-faced, long-eared, long-winded
hypocrites and bores. The only</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>religion fit for a gentleman was a polite Anglicanism wherein the
master attended Sunday services to lend support to a chaplain who kept
the villagers in fear of hell, and who said grace with due brevity from
the foot of the master’s board. It became more fashionable to be a
materialist with Hobbes than a Christian with Milton, a blind old fool
who took</p>
<p>Genesis as history. Hell, overdone for the past twenty years, had
lost its terrors for the possessing classes; heaven, for them, was here
and now, in a society freed from social rebellion and moral inhibitions,
under a court and King that gave the example and set the pace in
lechery, gambling, and merriment.</p>
<p>There were several good men and women at the court. Clarendon was a
man of principle and conduct until his daughter allowed herself to be
seduced, whereupon he lost his head and recommended that she should lose
hers. The fourth Earl of Southampton and the first Duke of Ormonde were
decent men. There were some sincerely religious men among the Anglican
clergy, even in the hierarchy. The Queen, and Lady Fanshaw, and Miss
Hamilton, and, later, Mrs. Godolphin, dared to be good. There were
doubtless others, lost to history because virtue makes no news.</p>
<p>The higher the rank, the lower the morals. The King’s brother James,
Duke of York, seems to have exceeded even the royal allotment of mis-
tresses. 101 While still in exile in Holland he had found his way to the
bed of Anne Hyde, daughter of the Chancellor. When she became pregnant
she begged him to marry her; he procrastinated, but finally made her
secretly his legal wife seven weeks before she gave birth (October 22,
1660). On hearing of the marriage Clarendon, according to his own
autobiography, 102 protested to the King that he had known nothing of
this alliance; that “he had much rather his daughter should be the
Duke’s whore than his wife”; that if they were really married, “the King
should immediately cause the woman to be . . . cast into a dungeon”; and
that “an act of Parliament should be immediately passed for cutting off
her head, to which he would not only give his consent, but would very
willingly be the first man that</p>
<p>should propose it.” Charles shrugge d the matter off as much ado
about nothing. Probably the Chancellor knew that Charles would not take
him at his word, and spoke with such Roman severity to offset any
suspicion that he had arranged the marriage in order to make his
daughter a queen. Anne, however, died of cancer in 1671, aged
thirty-four.</p>
<p>While motherhood distracted his wife, James made a mistress of
Arabella Churchill, whose brother accepted the situation philosophically
as favoring his advancement in the army. To aid Arabella and Anne the
Duke took some supplementary bedmates; Evelyn was especially disgusted
by his “bitchering” with Lady Denham (1666). 103 James’s conversion to
Catholi - cism made no apparent change in his morals. “He was
perpetually in one</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xamour or another,” wrote Burnet, “without being very nice in his
choice; upon which the King once said he believed his brother had his
mistresses given him by his priests for penance.” 104 The liaison with
Arabella con - tinued as an organ tone during these variations; it
survived the death of Anne, and James’s marriage (1673) to Mary of
Modena.</p>
<p>We should add that there were some admirable qualities in the Duke of
York. As Lord High Admiral (1660-73) he toiled to overcome the</p>
<p>disorder in the navy, due to the poor pay, victualing, and training
of the seamen; and he conducted himself with courage and skill in the
engagements with the Dutch. He attended ably and faithfully to the tasks
of administra- tion. He never wavered in his affectionate fidelity to
his brother, and waited patiently through a quarter of a century before
succeeding him on the throne. He was frank and sincere and easy of
access, but too conscious of his rank and authority to be popular. He
was a firm friend but an un- forgiving enemy. His mind was rather
laborious than keen; and he was suicidally immune to advice.</p>
<p>Close below him at the court was George Villiers, second Duke of</p>
<p>Buckingham. Son of James I’s assassinated favorite, he fought for
Charles I in the Civil War and for Charles II at Worcester; and the
restored King made him a privy councilor. Handsome and witty, genial and
generous, he for a time dominated the court with his charm. He wrote a
brilliant comedy, The Rehearsal, and dallied with alchemy and the
violin. But his face and his fortune ruined him. He passed from one
woman to another, indulged in disgraceful frolics, and squandered his
rich estate. Desiring the Countess of Shrewsbury, he challenged her
husband to a duel; she, disguised as a page, held Buckingham’s horse
while he fought; he killed the Count; the happy widow embraced the
victor, who was still covered with her husband’s blood; then they
returned in triump h to the victim’s home. 105 Buckingham was dismissed
from office (1674), abandoned himself to degeneration, and died in
poverty and disgrace (1688).</p>
<p>His rival in figure, wit, revelry, and decay was John Wilmot,
second</p>
<p>Earl of Rochester. John received the master’s degree at Oxford at the
incredible age of fourteen (1661), was admitted to the court at
seventeen, and became gentleman of the bedchamber to the King. At
nineteen, needing money, he made love to a rich heiress; finding her
dilatory, he kidnaped her, suffered imprisonment, won the lady’s
sympathy, then her hand, then her fortune. Charles repeatedly banished
him from the court, and repeatedly let him return, relishing his wit.
Like Buckingham, Rochester was an expert mimic. He delighted to disguise
himself as a porter, a beggar, a merchant, a German physician, and so
successfully that he deceived his closest friends. As a physician he
pretended to effect difficult cures through his knowledge of astrology;
he attracted hundreds of patients and cured several; soon the</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>ladies of the court came to him for treatment, and even those who had
known him well failed to recognize him. 106 In nearly all these
disguises he pursued women, quite disregarding their rank, and they
pursued him. He amused himself by writing satirical obscenities, ruined
his health with liquor and lechery, and boasted of having been drunk
uninterruptedly through five years. He died in poverty and penitence at
thirty-three.</p>
<p>There were so many others like him at the court that Pepys, himself
no amateur in adultery, wondered “what will be the end” of “so much . .
. drinking, swearing, and loose amours.” 107 Or, as Pope was to phrase
it in his Essay on Criticism, not with full justice to the King:</p>
<p>When love was all an easy monarch’s care,</p>
<p>Seldom at council, never in a war,</p>
<p>Jilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;</p>
<p>Nay, wits had pensions, and young lords had wit; . . .</p>
<p>The modest fan was lifted up no more,</p>
<p>And virgins smiled at what they blushed before. 108</p>
<p>It was taken for granted that wives were as unfaithful as husbands;
these demanded fidelity only from their mistresses. 109 The memoirs of
Count Philibert de Gramont, written in French by his brother-in-law
Anthony Hamilton, read at times like a roster of roosters, a
concatenation of cuckolds as seen by the Count in his happy exile at
Charles’s court.</p>
<p>Hours were given to dancing, horse races, cockfights, billiards,
cards, chess, floor games, and gay masquerades. Then, says Burnet, “both
the King and Queen” and “all the court went about masked, and came into
houses unknown, and danced there, with a great deal of wild frolic.” 110
Play was oft en for high stakes. “This evening,” says Evelyn, “according
to custom, his Majesty opened the revels … by throwing the dice himself
in the privy chamber . . . and lost his £ 100. (The year before, he won
£ 1,500.) The ladies also played very deep.” 11 1 The example of the
court in gambling and promiscuity spread through the upper classes.
Evelyn speaks of the</p>
<p>“depraved youth of England, whose prodigious debaucheries far surpass
the madness of all other civilized nations whatsoever.” 112 Homosexuali
ty flourished, especially in the army; Rochester wrote a play entitled
Sodomy, which was performed before the court. A number of brothels for
homo- sexual prostitution apparently existed in England. 113</p>
<p>Love marriages were increasing in number, and we hear of’some pretty
instances, as of Dorothy Osborne with William Temple. This proved a
happy marriage; yet Dorothy wrote: “To marry for love were no</p>
<p>reproachful thing if we did not see that of the thousand couples that
do it, hardly one can be brought for example that it may be done and not
repented afterward.” 114 Swift, writing to a young lady about her
marriage,</p>
<p>272 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. I</p>
<p>Xspeaks of “the person your father and mother have chosen for your
hus - band,” and adds, “Yours was a match of prudence and common good
feeling, without any hindrance of the ridiculous passion” of romantic
love . 118</p>
<p>Theoretically the husband had full control over his wife, including
the dowry she brought him. In all classes the husband’s will was law. In
the lower classes he used his legal rights to beat his wife, but the law
forbade him to use any stick thicker than his thumb . 117 Family
discipline was strong, except in upper-class London; there Clarendon
complained that parents had no manner of authority over their children,
nor children any obedience or submission to their parents, bu t
“everyone did what was good in his eyes .” 118 Divorce was rare, but
might be allowed by act of Parliament.</p>
<p>Crime continually threatened life and property. Thieves, cutpurses,
and pickpockets congregated in gangs and sallied forth at night. Dueling
was forbidden by law, but it remained the privilege of a gentleman; and
if the killing was done according to rule, the victor usually escaped
with a brief and courteous imprisonment. The law struggled to discourage
crime with what seems to us barbarous punishments; but perhaps sharp
measures had to be used to penetrate dull minds. For treason the penalty
was torture and death; for murder, felony, or counterfeiting the
currency, hanging; the wife who killed her husband was to be burned
alive. Petty larceny was punished by whipping, or the loss of an ear;
striking anyone in the Kang’s court incurred loss of the right hand;
forgery, cheating, false weights or measures, invited the pillory,
sometimes with both ears nailed to the board, or with perforation of the
tongue with a hot iron ; 120 usually the spectators enjoyed witnessing
these punishments , 121 and crowded in holiday spirit to see a prisoner
hanged. Under the Merrie Monarch there were ten thousand persons in jail
for debt. Prisons were filthy, but wardens could be bribed to provide
some comforts. Punishments were more severe than in contemporary France,
but the law was more liberal; there were no lettres de cachet in
England, and there were habeas corpus and jury trial.</p>
<p>Social morality shared in the general laxity. Charity was growing,
but the forty-one almshouses in England may have been merely another
side to the greed of the strong. Nearly everyone cheated at cards . 122
Corruption was above normal in al l classes. Pepys’s Diary smells with
corruption in business, in politics, in the navy, and in Pepys. Business
firms watered their stock, falsified their accounts, and charged
exorbitant prices to the</p>
<p>government . 123 Funds voted to the army or navy were diverted in
part</p>
<p>CHAP. IX )</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>into the pockets of officials and courtiers. High officers of state,
even when their salaries were ample and paid, sold titles, contracts,
commissions, appointments, and pardons on such a scale that “the regular
salary was the smallest part of the gains.” 124 Heads of government like
Clarendon, Daiiby, and Sunderland grew rich in a few years, and bought
or built estates far beyond their salaries. Members of Parliament sold
their votes to ministers, even to foreign governments; 125 on some votes
two hundred members were “taken off” the opposition by ministerial
lubrication. 126 In 1675 it was estimated that two thirds of the Commons
were in the pay of Charles II, and the other third in the pay of Louis
XIV. 127 The French King found it quite feasible to bribe members to
vote against Charles whenever Charles deviated troublesomely from
Bourbon policies. As for Charles, he repeatedly accepted large sums from
Louis to play the French game in politics, religion, or war. It was the
gayest and most rotten society in history.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>As in France, manners tried to redeem morals, and gave a ceremonious
grace to ornate dress, obscene literature, and profane speech. Charles
him- self was a model of manners; his courtesy and charm spread through
the upper classes, and left their mark on English life. Men kissed each
other on meeting, and kissed a lady on being introduced to her. Ladies
in London, as in Paris, received gentlemen while indeed. There was an
invigorating frank- ness, a scorn of hypocrisy, in the literature, the
theater, and the court. But the candor released a flood of coarseness on
the stage &gt; and in daily speech. Profanity was unparalleled. Here
Charles was among, the exceptions, con- fining himself to “Odds fish” as
his favorite oath. The surviving Puritans were clean of speech except in
belaboring their opponents; and the Quakers refused to swear.</p>
<p>Men outdid the women in fanciful dress, from powdered wigs to silk
stockings and buckled shoes. The wig or periwig was another import from
France. Cavaliers and others whose hair was short, and who were loath to
be mistaken for close-cropped Puritan Roundheads, covered their shortage
with alien cuttings; and men whose hair was turning gray or white found
the wig useful in disguising their age, for then nearly all men shaved.
It offset in some measure the King’s Spanish complexion and
Brobdingnagian nose. Pepys made his first wig a critical affair, and
mourned that his own beloved hair had to be shorn to make way for his
peruke and provide hair for another head; 128 periodically he had his
wig “cleansed of its nits.” 129 The stiff Elizabethan- Jacobean ruff had
now disappeared. Doublet and long cloak were giving way to waistcoat and
surcoat; the waistcoat Qr vest,</p>

<p>Xhowever, reached to the calf of the leg, and was bound to the body
by a sash. Breeches stopped at the knee. Swords dangled at the side of
aristocratic or moneyed legs. Velvet and lace, ribbons and frills,
helped to complete the courtly man; and in winter he might keep his
hands warm in a muff hung from his neck.</p>
<p>Fashionable women powdered and perfumed their hair, curled it into
ringlets over their foreheads, and supplemented it with false locks
mounted on secret wires. They feathered their hats with rare plumage.
They painted black spots (“patches”) upon their cheeks, foreheads, or
chins as added inducements to the chase. They exposed their shoulders
and generous portions of their breasts; so Louise de Keroualle had Lely
paint her with one breast naked, and Nell Gwyn went her one better. Legs
were alluringly concealed. Dainty articles of toilette were in rising
demand. Woman was already so intricate an artifact that a Restoration
play pictured her in hyperbole:</p>
<p>Her teeth were made in the Blackfriars, her eyebrows in the Strand,
and her hair on Silver Street. . . . She takes herself asunder, when she
goes to bed, into some twenty boxes, and about noon the next day is put
together again like a great German clock. 130</p>
<p>Extravagance was de rigueur. Life, become ceremonious again, required
elaborate equipment. Servants had to be hired in gross; Evelyn’s father
had half a hundred; Pepys had a cook, a housemaid, a lady’s maid, and a
serving girl. Meals were tremendous; note Pepys’s dinner on January 26,
1660, long before his salad days:</p>
<p>My wife had got ready a very fine dinner — viz., a dish of marrow</p>
<p>bones, a leg of mutton, a loin of veal, a dish of fowl, three
pullets, and two dozen of larks all in a dish; a great tart, a neat’s
tongue, a dish of anchovies, a dish of prawns and cheese.</p>
<p>The main meal was taken about one o’clock. Cooking was English.</p>
<p>Gramont, when Charles explained that the servants waited on him on
bended kn ee as a mark of respect, said (or so he tells us): “I thank
your Majesty for the explanation; I thought they were begging your
pardon for serving you so bad a dinner.” 131</p>
<p>Drinking of alcoholic beverages was no merely social function. Water
was scarcely ever drunk, even by children; 132 beer was easier to find
than water fit to drink. So everybody, of any age, drank beer, and the
well-to-do added whiskey or imported wine. Most people visited a tavern
once a day, and all classes got drunk now and then.</p>
<p>Coffee had come in from Turkey about 1650; till 1700 most of it
was</p>
<p>CHAP, rx)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>*75</p>
<p>imported from the region around Mocha in the Yemen; in the eighteenth
century the Dutch transplanted it to Java, the Portuguese to Ceylon and
Brazil, the English to Jamaica. The use of coffee to overcome drowsiness
and stimulate the wits spread its popularity. London opened its first
coffeehouse in 1652; by 1700 there were three thousand of them in the
capital. 133 Every man of any account made one or another of them his
regular rendezvous, where he could meet his friends and learn the latest
scandal and news. Charles II tried to suppress the coffeehouses as
centers of political agitation and conspiracy, but the itch to talk and
drink and smell tobacco smoke frustrated him. From some coffeehouses
sprang the clubs that played a role in eighteenth-century politics, and
then became a refuge from monogamy. The coffeehouses, however, differed
from the later clubs, not only because coffee was the favorite drink,
but because conversa- tion was encouraged. Literary lions like Dryden,
Addison, and Swift had their rostrums in coffeehouses. English freedom
of speech was nourished there.</p>
<p>Tea came to England from China about 1650, but it was so expensive
that a century passed before it displaced coffee in the English ritual.
Pepys thought it quite an adventure when he had his first cup of tea.
134 Meanwhile the cacao bean had been imported from Mexico and Central
America; about 1658 a new drink was made by adding vanilla and sugar to
cacao; the re- sultant chocolate became a popular drink during the
Restoration, and was served in many coffeehouses.</p>
<p>All classes, including many women and some children, now smoked
tobacco, always through long pipes. The women thought it had some
antiseptic value, as in averting plague. Probably from this notion the
habit arose, in this period, of taking snuff — i.e., inhaling powdered
tobacco.</p>
<p>Now that the Puritan incubus was lifted, games and sports flourished.
The poor again enjoyed puppet shows, circuses, cockfighting, bear and
bull baiting, tightrope walkers, wrestlers, jugglers, pugilists,
conjurers. The rich took to venery in both its senses. Charles II played
tennis till he was fifty-three. Evelyn liked bowling on the green, which
is still a pretty sight in England today. Cricket was beginning to be a
national pastime; in 1661 we find the first mention of a ground
specifically reserved for it. In that year Vauxhall Gardens were laid
out on the south bank of the Thames, and soon became a fashionable
resort. St. James’s Park was opened to the public by Charles II. Hyde
Park was now established as the place where the elite, led by the King
and Queen, drove carriages on pleasant afternoons. “Society” was
beginning to take the waters at Bath.</p>
<p>All but the poorest classes traveled in stagecoaches, which had begun
a regular “penny post” service in 1657, an d a scheduled passenger
service in 1658. “Hackney coaches” had served intracity traffic since
1625. The</p>
<p>l“〕6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xvery rich traveled in a “coach -and- six”; the three teams were not
for dis - play, but to pull the coach through muddy stretches; sometimes
the local cattle had to be hitched in front of the horses to tug the
coach out of hub- deep mire. Roads were mud or dust. The roadside inns,
with their lively mixture of coachmen, travelers, actors, salesmen,
thieves, and tarts, were preparing to make their contribution to the
literature of England. The rough, lusty, lovable England that Dickens
knew in his youth was taking form.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>RELIGION AND POLITICS</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid this human pullulation the struggle of the faiths continued, and
the old conflict between king and Parliament was renewed. The Merrie
Monarch was saddened to find that the House of Commons, after the
honeymoon of its proferred obedience, was jealous of his power, and
sparing of its funds. Tender in heart but tough in conscience, Charles
turned to the French King for private loans. He promised — and
apparently desired — to alleviate the disabilities of the English
Catholics, to support the policy of Louis XIV against the Netherlands,
and to sell to France the Channel port of Dunkirk, which Cromwell’s
soldiers had won. Dunkirk was costly to defend; it was a thorn in the
side of France; Charles let it go (1662) for five million francs, which,
along with secret Bourbon sub- sidies, enabled him to ignore for a while
the oligarchy of land and money that now ruled Parliament.</p>
<p>The oligarchs, however, thought that the funds of the government
should be used to wage another profitable war against the Dutch. The
same rivalry in commerce and fisheries that had produced the First Dutch
War in 1652 supported the Second Dutch War in 1664. Charles resisted the
martial current as long as he could, for he much preferred love. “I
never saw so great an appetite for war,” he wrote to his sister, “as is
in both this town and country, especially in the Parliament men. I find
myself the only man in my kingdom who doth not desire war.” 135</p>
<p>Everything went badly. The English navy, ill-fed, ill-clothed,
ill-</p>
<p>munitioned, fought bravely, but lost as often as it won; and at the
height of the war plague and fire left London desolate and England
bankrupt. Toward the end of 1666 the Dutch opened negotiations for
peace; Charles, glad to come to terms, sent commissioners to Breda.
Confident that an agreement was in sight, and seeing himself at the end
of his finances, he laid up part of the English fleet in the Medway, and
allowed the sailors to take service in merchantmen. In June, 1667, de
Ruyter led a Dutch squad- ron into the Thames and the Medway, and
destroyed most of the unmanned</p>

<p>THE RESTORATION</p>

<p>ships. That very night, says Pepys, “the King did sup with my
Lady</p>
<p>Castlemaine at the Duchess of Monmouth’s, and they were all mad in
hunting a poor moth.” 138 When the news of the attack reached London
every able-bodied man was called to arms. But the Dutch too wanted
peace, for the French had invaded Flanders. The Treaty of Breda (July
21, 1667) ended the Second Dutch War on terms unsatisfactory to all.</p>
<p>The position of the King was so weakened by the fiasco and the
ac-</p>
<p>cumulated misfortunes of London that some Englishmen thought of
deposing him. Parliament demanded parliamentary supervision of govern-
mental expenses; Charles yielded, being penniless, and another step was
taken toward parliamentary supremacy. Parliament demanded the dismissal
of Clarendon for mishandling foreign affairs; Charles was not unwilling
to let him go, for his Chancellor had opposed his moves toward religious
toleration, and had censured his absorption in mistresses. Not satisfied
with Clarendon’s resignation, the Commons drew up a proposal to impeach
him for subservience to France. Clarendon took the King’s advice and
fled to the Continent. It was a pitiful and cruel end for a long career
of service. The old man glorified his exile by writing the finest
historical work that English literature had yet produced. He died at
Rouen in 1674, aged sixty-five.</p>
<p>Charles appointed five men to replace him (1667): Sir Thomas
Clifford, the Earl of Arlington, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord Ashley
(soon to be the first Earl of Shaftesbury), and the Earl of Lauderdale.
Their initials made the word cabal, by which the new ministry came to be
called. Clifford was an avowed Catholic, Arlington was inclined toward
that faith, Buckingham was a rake, Shaftesbury was a tolerant skeptic,
Lauderdale was a former Covenanter who with fire and sword forced
episcopacy upon his fellow Scots. Charles listened to their conflicting
counsels, but more and more followed his own.</p>
<p>His aims were basically two: to renew absolute monarchy, and to
elevate Roman Catholicism in England. He looked with hope to being
succeeded by his Catholic brother James. He corresponded with the
general of the Jesuits in Rome, and gave a secret interview to a papal
intemuncio who came to London from Brussels. 137 In January, 1669, he
told his brother, Clifford, Arlington, and Lord Arundell that he wished
to reconcile himself with the Church of Rome, and bring all England back
to the old faith. 138 His sister Henrietta never ceased to urge him to
boldly announce his conversion.</p>
<p>In May, 1670, Louis XIV sent Henrietta to England, aided by
subtle</p>
<p>diplomats, to bind Charles to a French and Catholic policy. On June
1, 1670, Clifford, Arundell, and Arlington signed for England the secret
Treaty of Dover. The French King agreed to pay Charles £ 1 50,000

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xever Charles should announce his conversion to Catholicism; if need
should arise, Louis would furnish Charles with six thousand soldiers, to
be main- tained at French expense; Charles, when called upon, was to
join France in war against the United Provinces; he was to receive
,£225,000 a year while the war continued; he was to take and keep some
Dutch islands; and he was to support the claims of Louis to inherit
Spain. 139 To deceive the Parliament and the people of England, Charles
sent Buckingham to Paris to draw up a sham treaty, which was signed on
December 21, 1670, and was published to the world; it pledged England to
war against the Dutch, but made no mention of religion.</p>
<p>Charles took his time — fifteen years — about announcing his
conversion. His brother openly proclaimed himself a Catholic in 1671;
but even the pro-Catholic Earl of Arlington warned the King that a
similar admission might precipitate a revolution. Charles, however,
moved toward his goal by issuing (March 15, 1672) his s econd
“Declaration of Indulgence for Tender Consciences,” suspending “all
manner of penal laws in matters</p>
<p>On March 17, 1672, England opened the Third Dutch War. In this</p>
<p>matter King and Parliament were now agreed. The Parliament voted £
1,250,000 for the war, but this sum was to be doled out to the govern-
ment in installments that would obviously depend upo n the King’s recon
- ciliation with Parliament and its religious legislation. The
Commons</p>
<p>declared that “penal statutes in matters ecclesiastical cannot be
suspended but by Act of Parliament”; and it sent a petition to the King
that his</p>
<p>Declaration of Indulgence should be withdrawn. Louis XIV, anxious to
have England give united support to the war against the Dutch, advised
Charles to cancel .the Declaration until the war should be successfully
con- cluded. Charles yielded, and on March 8, 1673, the Declaration
was</p>
<p>annulled.</p>
<p>It is probable that by that time the Protestant leaders had got wind
of the secret Treaty of Dover. To contracept any royal conversion, both
houses passed, at the end of March, a “Test Act,” by which all holders
of civil or military office in England were required to abjure the
Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, and to take the Sacrament
according to the</p>
<p>CHAP. EX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>Anglican rite. Clifford fought the bill passionately; after its
passage he resigned from the government, retired to his estate, and soon
died — by suicide, Evelyn thought. Shaftesbury warmly supported the
bill; he was dismissed from the ministry, and ma de himself the leader
of the “Country Party” that opposed, to the verge of revolution, the
“Court Party” favoring the King. The Cabal ended (1673); the Earl of
Danby became chief</p>
<p>minister.</p>
<p>James resigned his offices. The opposition to him had been in
some</p>
<p>degree mollified by the fact that though his first wife had accepted
Cathol- icism, her children, the future Queens Mary and Anne, were being
brought up as Protestants. But now his marriage (September 30, 1673) to
a Catholic princess roused virulent condemnation. Mary of Modena was
branded as “the Pope’s eldest daughter,” and it was assumed that she
would bring up her children as Catholics. Bills were at once introduced
into Parliament that all royal children must be reared in the Protestant
faith.</p>
<p>The turn of events soured England’s taste for the war against the
United Provinces. If England should have a Catholic king he would sooner
or later join France and Spain in utterly destroying the Dutch Republic
— which now appeared not as a commercial rival but as the bulwark of
Protestantism on the Continent. If that should fall, how would English
Protestantism stand? Charles willingly commissioned Sir William Temple
to conclude a separate peace with the Dutch. On February 9, 1674, the
Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Dutch War.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE “POPISH plot”</li>
</ol>
<p>An almost lucid interval followed. Having received an additional</p>
<p>500,000 crowns from Louis, Charles prorogued his troublesome
Parliament and returned to his mistresses. But politics continued.
Shaftesbury and other opposition leaders established (1675) the Green
Ribbon Club, and from that center the Country Party issued its
propaganda to defend Parlia- ment and Protestantism against a King
plotting with Catholic France and an heir apparent wedded to a Catholic
wife. By 1680 these men of the Country Party had come to be called
Whigs, and the defenders of the royal power were labeled Tories.*
Shaftesbury seemed to Charles “the - ficial, … his vanity ridiculous, …
his reasoning loose”; 142 but John Locke, who lived with Shaftesbury for
fifteen years, thought him a brave defender</p>
<ul>
<li>Whig was apparently a shortened form of Whiggamore, the name of a
band of Scots active in 1648 against Charles I. Tory was an Irish word
for robber, and was first applied to the Court Party by Titus Oates in
1680. 140</li>
</ul>
<p>280 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. I</p>
<p>Xof civil, religious, and philosophical liberty. Burnet called him a
deist; and we might suspect as much from Shaftesbury’s remark that “wise
men are of but one religion.” When a lady asked which one that was, he
answered, “Wise men never tell.” 143</p>
<p>The religious tension fell slightly in 1677, when William of
Orange</p>
<p>married Protestant Mary, eldest daughter of the Duke of York; if
James continued to have no male issue, Mary would be next to him in line
for the throne, and England would be joined in marriage with the
Protestant Dutch. But on August 28, 1678, Titus Oates came before the
King, and announced that he had discovered a “Popish plot”: the Pope,
the King of France, the Archbishop of Armagh, and the Jesuits of
England, Ireland, and Spain were planning to kill Charles, enthrone his
brother, and impose Catholicism in England by the sword; three thousand
cutthroats were to massacre the leading Protestants of London, and
London itself, the citadel of English Protestantism, was to be burned to
the ground.</p>
<p>Oates, then twenty-nine, was the son of an Anabaptist preacher. He
had become an Anglican clergyman, but had been expelled from his bene-
fice for disorderly conduct. 144 He had accepted, or pretended,
conversion to Catholicism, and had studied in Jesuit colleges at
Valladolid and St.- Omer, from which last he had been expelled; 145
meanwhile, he now claimed, he had learned the secret plans of the
Jesuits for the conquest of England. He professed to have been present
on April 24, 1678, at a Jesuit conference in London, which had discussed
means of killing the King. He named five Catholic peers as in the plot:
Arundell, Powis, Petre, Stafford, and Bellasis. When Oates added that
Bellasis was to be commander in chief of the papist army, Charles
laughed, for Bellasis was bedridden with gout; the King concluded that
Oates had fabricated the story in hopes of reward, and dismissed
him.</p>
<p>The Privy Council thought it safer to assume some truth in the
charges. It summoned Oates to appear before it on September 28. Fearing
that he would be imprisoned, Oates went before Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey,
a justice of the peace, and left with him a sworn deposition detailing
the plot. The Council, impressed by his testimony, ordered the arrest of
several papists implicated by him. One of these was Edward Coleman, who
had been for some years (till dismissed at the King’s bidding) secretary
to the Duchess of York. Before the arrest, Coleman burned some of his
papers, but those that he had no time to bum showed that he had carried
on with Pere La Chaise, the Jesuit confessor of Louis XIV,
correspondence ex- pressing on both sides the hope that England would
soon be made Catholic. In these letters Coleman suggested that Louis XIV
should send him money to influence members of Parliament in the Catholic
interest, and added: “Success will give the greatest blow to the
Protestant religion that it has</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>received since its birth, … the conversion of three kingdoms, and by
that, perhaps, the utter subduing of a pestilent heresy.” 146 The fact
that Cole - man had destroyed most of his correspondence led the Council
to believe that he had known of, perhaps had been an agent in, the plot
described by Oates. Charles himself concluded from these letters that
some real plot existed.</p>
<p>On October 12 Justice Godfrey disappeared. Five days later his corpse
was found in a suburban field. He had evidently been murdered — by
agents, and for reasons, still unknown, but the Protestants ascribed the
assassina- tion to Catholics who hoped to prevent the publication of
Oates’s depo - sition. This event seemed to confirm the charges; and in
the atmosphere of distrust left by the secret Treaty of Dover, and the
fear of James’s ac - cession, it was natural that most of Protestant
England should now credit all the accusations made by Oates, and should
fall into a frenzy in which the protection of Protestantism seemed to
require the arrest, if not the execution, of any Catholic named in the
conspiracy.</p>
<p>A reign of terror began which continued for almost four years. James
fled to the Netherlands. The citizens of London armed themselves to re-
sist an expected invasion; cannon were planted in Whitehall; guards were
placed in the vaults beneath the Houses of Parliament to circumvent a
second Gunpowder Plot. Parliament passed a bill excluding Catholics from
the House of Lords. It hailed Oates as the savior of the nation, awarded
him a life pension of twelve hundred pounds a year, and gave him an
apartment in Whitehall Palace. Soon the prisons were filled with
Jesuits, secular priests, and Catholic laymen implicated by Oates or by
William Bedloe, who came forward claiming knowledge that would
substantiate Oates’s charges.</p>
<p>On November 24 Oates laid before the Council a new and startling</p>
<p>accusation — that he had heard the Queen consent to the poisoning of
her husband by her physician. Charles caught Oates in a demonstrable
lie, lost faith in his stories, and had him arrested. The Commons
ordered him freed, arrested three servants of the Queen, and voted an
address demanding the Queen’s removal. Charles came to the upper house,
defended his wife’s loyalty, and persuaded the Lords to refuse
concurrence in the Commons’ address. On November 27 Coleman and another
Catholic layman were tried, were found guilty of treason, and were
executed. On December 17 six Jesuits and three secular priests were put
to death, and on February 5, 1679, three men were hanged for the murder
of Godfrey. These twelve were later proved innocent.</p>
<p>The attack pressed closer to the King. On December 19, 1678, Parlia-
ment received from Paris communications showing that Danby had ac-
cepted large sums of money from Louis XIV. The minister refused to</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xexplain that these sums were French subsidies to the King. The
Commons impeached him, and Charles, fearing that his loyal councilor
would be condemned to death, dissolved the “Cavalier Parliament”
(January 24,</p>
<p>1679), which had sat, discontinuously, for almost eighteen years —
longer than the Long Parliament.</p>
<p>But the firs t “Whig” Parliament, which met on March 6, was more</p>
<p>passionately anti-Catholic and anti-King than its predecessor. The
Com- mons charged Danby with treason; the Lords saved him by committing
him to the Tower, where he remained in comfort and anxiety during the
five following turbulent years. On the advice of Sir William Temple</p>
<p>Charles named a new Council of thirty members; to appease the
opposition he included in it the two leaders of the Whig Party,
Shaftesbury and George Savile, Marquis of Halifax; and on the King’s
recommendation Shaftesbury was chosen lord president of the Council. To
further calm the storm, Charles offered to Parliament a compromise
substitute for the exclusion of his brother from the throne: no Catholic
should be admitted to Parliament or hold any place of trust; the king
should lose the power to make ecclesiastical appointments; his
nomination of judges should be subject to Parliamentary approval; and
Parliament should control the army and navy. 147 But Parliament felt no
confidence that James would honor such an agreement. On May 11
Shaftesbury himself introduced the first exclusion bill in unmistakable
terms: “to disable the Duke of York to</p>
<p>inherit the imperial crown of this realm.” On May 26 the
Parliament</p>
<p>The right of habeas corpus did not help the papists accused by Oates,
for they were tried with little delay, and, if found guilty of treason,
were executed with angry haste. All through 1679 they went to the
scaffold or the block. Trials were expeditious because the judges,
frightened by the cries of the bloodthirsty crowds outside the court,
condemned many of the defendants without dissecting the evidence or
allowing cross-examina- tion of witnesses. False witnesses, noting the
rewards enjoyed by Oates, arose as if by incantation, and swore to the
wildest tales: one, that an army of thirty thousand men was coming from
Spain; another, that he had been promised five hundred pounds and
canonization if he would kill the King; another, that he had heard a
rich Catholic banker vow to do the same. 148 No counsel was allowed to
the accused; he was not told till the day of</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>THE RESTORATION</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>trial what the accusation would be; and he was assumed to be guilty
unless he could prove his innocence. 149 To make conviction easier, an
old Eliza- bethan law was revived that made it a capital crime for a
priest to be in England. The surrounding crowds hooted and pelted
witnesses for the de- fense, and shouted with joy when verdicts of
guilty were announced. 150 All this was a heartbreaking experience for
the once Merrie Monarch, who saw all his hopes shattered, his powers
reduced, his wife humiliated, his brother scorned and set aside. At the
height of the storm he fell so seriously ill that his death was expected
at any hour. Halifax summoned James from Brussels. The Whig leaders
ordered the army to prevent his return; and Shaftesbury, Monmouth, Lord
Russell, and Lord Grey agreed that in case Charles should die they would
lead an insurrection to prevent the accession of his brother. 151 James
found entry in disguise, and made his way to the bedside of the King.
Charles apparently recovered, and smiled at the fears with which even
his enemies had contemplated his death. He never really recovered.</p>
<p>The anti-Catholic fury continued till Oates blundered in the trial
of</p>
<p>Sir George Wakeman, the Queen’s physician. In testimony before the
Council he had exonerated the doctor; in the trial he accused him of
plan- ning to poison the King. Chief Justice Scroggs, who had prosecuted
the Catholics with vigor, pointed out the contradiction. Wakeman was ac-
quitted, and thereafter Oates’s testimony was more critically heard. The
false witnesses who had corroborated him fell away from his support. The
execution of Oliver Plunket, the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, was the
last act of the anti-Catholic terror (July 1, 1681).</p>
<p>When the fear and passion had subsided, sane men realized that Oates,
partly by unsupported suspicions, partly by lies, had sent many innocent
men to a premature death. They concluded that there had been no plan to
kill the King, or to massacre Protestants, or to bum London. But they
felt, too, that a Cat holic, though not a “popish,” plot had been real:
that</p>
<p>284</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<ol start="19" type="I">
<li>COMOEDIA FIN1TA</li>
</ol>
<p>Shaftesbury was resolved to the contrary. Coleman had confessed, at
his trial, that James had known and approved of his correspondence with
Pere La Chaise. 162 Shaftesbury felt that the accession of James would
realize the first stage of the “Popish Plot.” He offered his support to
Charles if the King would divorce his barren Queen and marry a
Protestant by whom he might have a Protestant son. Charles refused to
let Catherine of</p>
<p>Braganza repeat the role of Catherine of Aragon. Shaftesbury then
turned to the Duke of Monmouth, the King’s bastard, who could not
forgive his father for cheating him of the throne by failing to marry
his mother. Shaftesbury spread the idea that Charles had really married
Lucy Walter, and that the Duke was the legal heir to the throne. Charles
countered by a declaration that he had never married anyone but
Catherine of Braganza. Finding Shaftesbury irreconcilable, the King
dismissed him from the Coun- cil (October 13, 1679).</p>
<p>In this succession of crises Charles almost changed his character. He
gave up his life of pleasure and ease, sold his stables, devoted himself
to administration and politics, and fought his foes with strategic
retreats until they overreached themselves into failure. In his final
five years he showed such resolution and ability as surprised even his
friends. Recovering his confidence, he called for his fourth
Parliament.</p>
<p>It met on October 21, 1680. In November the second exclusion bill</p>
<p>passed the Commons and was presented to the Lords. Halifax, who had
heretofore voted with the Whigs, now veered to the side of the King, and
began to earn and flaunt the title of “trimmer.” He detested James and
distrusted Catholicism, but he agreed with Charles that the principle of
hereditary monarchy should be maintained, and he feared that Shaftesbury
was leading England toward another civil war. 153 In a long debate his
eloquence and logic persuaded the Lords to reject the bill. The Commons
retaliated by refusing funds to the King, and forbidding any merchant or
financier to lend him money, and it impeached Halifax, Scroggs, and
Viscount Stafford — one of the five Catholic lords imprisoned in the
Tower. Stafford was condemned to death on the testimony of Oates, and
was beheaded (December 7). The King dismissed the Parliament (January
18,</p>
<p>1681).</p>
<p>Rather than sacrifice his brother to his need for funds, Charles
decided to finance the government by becoming again a pensioner of Louis
XIV. He consented to look with equanimity upon the aggressive policies
of France in return for ^7oo,ooo 164 — enough to make him independent of
parliamentary subsidies for three years. So sinewed, he summoned his
fifth</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE RESTORATION 285</p>
<p>Parliament. To deprive it of support from the mobs and militia of
London, he ordered it to meet at Oxford. Both sides came in arms —
Charles with numerous guards, the Whig leaders with retainers carrying
swords and pistols and flying banners reading “No Popery, No Slavery.”
The Com - mons at once passed the third exclusion bill. Before the
measure could reach the Lords, Charles dismissed the Parliament (March
28, 1681).</p>
<p>Many men now expected Shaftesbury to resort to civil war; and public
opinion, remembering 1642-60, turned against him and rallied to the
King. The Anglican clergy zealously defended the right of Catholic James
to the throne. When Shaftesbury tried to reorganize the disbanded
Commons into a revolutionary convention, 155 Charles ordered his arrest.
A jury acquitted Shaftesbury (November 24) ; and though he was now so
ill that he could barely walk, he joined with the Duke of Monmouth in
open revolution. 156 The King had both of them arrested. Shaftesbury
escaped from the Tower, fled to Holland, and died there (January 21,
1683),</p>
<p>worn out, but leaving his friend Locke to carry on in philosophy
the</p>
<p>struggle that had for a time been lost in politics.</p>
<p>Charles pardoned Monmouth, but he could not forgive the London jury
that had acquitted Shaftesbury. Becoming extreme in his turn, he
resolved to destroy the autonomy of the cities, for it was in these that
Whig — even revolutionary — sentiment flourished. He ordered an
examination of the city charters that permitted such municipal flouting
of the royal will. Legal flaws were found in them; they were declared
null; and new charters were issued by which all municipally elected
officials were henceforth to be subject to veto or removal by the king
(1683). Freedom of speech and press were now subjected to new
restraints. A persecution of Dissenters (not of Catholics) was begun,
for the Dissenters were mostly Whigs; and in Scotland James personally
led the oppression. The triumph of royal prerogative over parliamentary
privilege seemed complete, and the achieve- ments of the Great Rebellion
were apparently to be sacrificed in a royalist reaction supported by a
nation fearful of renewed civil war. Halifax re- flected the feeling of
the country when he abandoned Shaftesbury and turned his temperate
wisdom to serve the King (1682-85) as lord privy seal.</p>
<p>The followers of Shaftesbury made a final attempt. In January, 1683,
the Duke of Monmouth, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Carlisle, William
Lord Russell, and Algernon Sidney met at the house of John Hampden
(grandson of the Civil War hero), and laid plans to circumvent James
and, if necessary, assassinate Charles. Sidney hoped to proceed further
and re- establish the English republic. He was the grandson of a brothei
of Sir Philip Sidney, the “President of Chivalry.” He fought on the
Parliamentary</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xone of the commission to try Charles I, he refused to serve, saying
that the commission had received no authority from the people to try the
King. Finding himself on the Continent at the Restoration, he stayed
there, en- gaged in studies and in plots against Charles II. During the
Second Dutch War he urged the Dutch to invade England, and he offered
his services to the French government to raise a rebellion in England if
it would supply him with 100,000 crowns. 157 Charles allowed him to
return to England (1677) to attend the death of his father. Remaining in
England, he joined the Country Party. In Discourses Concerning
Government (written in 1681 but not published till 1688), he advocated
semirepublican principles, anticipated Locke by attacking Filmer ’s
defense of divine right in kings, and asserted the right of the people
to judge and depose their rulers. Ap- parently both he and Russell
accepted money from the French govern- ment, which was interested in
keeping Charles II busy with domestic troubles. 168</p>
<p>The “Council of Six” decided to capture the King. It was known
that</p>
<p>in March he would attend the horse races at Newmarket; on his return
to London his coach would pass by Rye House, at Hoddesdon, north of the
city; a cart of hay was to block the road there; the King, and perhaps
his brother, were to be taken, alive or dead. But on March 22 a fire
broke out at the racecourse; the races were ended a week sooner than
scheduled, and Charles passed safely to London before the conspirators
could advance their preparations. On June 1 2 one of them, fearing
exposure and hoping for pardon, betrayed the plot to the government.
Carlisle, arrested, con- firmed the confession, and was forgiven.
Monmouth protested innocence, and though Charles knew that his son was
lying, he canceled the order for his arrest. Russell was tried,
convicted, and executed (July 21, 1683). Essex killed himself in jail.
“He needed not to have despaired of mercy,” said the King, “for I owed
him a life”; 159 Essex’ father had died for Charles I. Several minor
participants in this “Rye House Plot” were hanged. Sidney was convicted
on technically inadequate evidence; he defended himself ably, and met
his death like a Roman (December 7). His motto had been Manus haec
inimica tyrannis — “This hand is the foe of tyrants”; but he had chosen
a double-edged sword. On the scaffold he uttered notable words: “God has
left nations unto the liberty of setting up such govern - ments as
please themselves.” 160 He refu sed any religious attendance, saying
that he was already at peace with God.</p>
<p>Charles had won, but he was through. He enjoyed, wearily, a new popu-
larity. England had prospered economically under his reign, and now,
longing for political quiet, it rallied to a ruler who represented
national continuity and order, even if that meant for a time a Catholic
king. It</p>

<p>forgave Charles his faults as it saw him fading into premature
decline. It half agreed with him that a monarchy elective and not
hereditary invited periodical turmoil. It respected his loyalty to his
brother, even while it mourned the result. It saw James triumphant,
again lord high admiral, al- ready pursuing his enemies vengefully. In
January, 1685, James brought and won a civil suit against Titus Oates
for £ 100,000 damages; Oates, unable to pay this great sum, was
imprisoned. “When I am dead and gone,” said Charles sadly, “I know not
what my brother will do; I am very much afraid that when he comes to
wear the crown he will be obliged to travel again. And yet I will take
care to leave my kingdoms to him in peace, wishing he may keep them long
so. But this hath all of my fears, little of my hopes, and less of my
reason.” 1 61 When James expostulated with him for driving about London
unguarded, he bade him calm his fears: “No one will kill me to make you
king.” 182</p>
<p>He should have excepted the doctors. On February 2, 1685, he suffered
a convulsion; his face was distorted, his mouth foamed. Dr. King bled
him by lancing a vein, with good effect. But attendants summoned
eighteen other physicians to diagnose and prescribe. For five tortured
days he sub- mitted to their united attack. They tapped his veins, put
cupping glasses to his shoulders, cut off his hair to raise blisters on
his scalp, and applied to the soles of his feet plasters of pitch and
pigeon dung. “To remove the</p>
<p>The dying King called for his long-suffering wife, not perceiving
that</p>
<p>she was already kneeling at the foot of the bed, rubbing his feet. On
February 4 some bishops offered him the last rites of the Anglican
Church, but he begged them to desist. When his brother asked him did he
want a Catholic priest, he answered, “Yes, yes, with all my heart.” 164
Father John Huddleston, who had saved Charles’s life at the battle of
Worcester, and whose life Charles had saved in the Popish Terror, was
sent for; Charles made profession of the Roman Catholic faith, confessed
his sins, pardoned his enemies, asked pardon of all, and received
extreme unction and the last sacrament. He asked pardon especially of
his wife; but also he bade his brother take care of Louise de Keroualle
and his children, and “let not poor Nelly starve.” 165 He apologized to
those around him for taking so unconscionable a time dying. 166</p>
<p>By noon of February 6 the Duke of York was King.</p>
