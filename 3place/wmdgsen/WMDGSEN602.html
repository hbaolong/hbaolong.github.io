<h4 id="chapter-vii-the-consulate">CHAPTER VII The Consulate</h4>
<p>November n, 1799 — May 18, 1804</p>
<p>I. THE NEW CONSTITUTION</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Consuls</li>
</ol>
<p>O N November 12, 1799, the Provisional Consuls — Napoleon, Sieyes,
and Roger Ducos — aided by two committees from the old Councils, met in
the Luxembourg Palace to rebuild France. Sieyes and Ducos, as members of
the late Directory, already had apartments there; Napoleon, Josephine,
Eugene, Hortense, and their staffs had moved in on November 1 1.</p>
<p>The victors in the coup d’etat faced a nat ion in economic,
political, re- ligious, and moral disarray. Peasants worried lest some
returning Bourbon should revoke their title deeds. Merchants and
manufacturers saw their pros- perity threatened by blockaded ports,
neglected roads, and highway rob- bery. Financiers hesitated to invest
in the securities of a government that had been so often overturned;
now, when the situation cried out for law enforcement, public works, and
poor relief, the Treasury had only twelve hundred francs at its
disposal. Religion was in constant opposition: out of eight thousand
Catholic priests in France, six thousand had refused to sign the Civil
Constitution of the Clergy, and labored in quiet or open hostility to
the state. Public education, withdrawn from the Church, was in ruins de-
spite magnificent pronouncements and plans. The family, chief prop of
so- cial order, had been shaken by the freedom and prevalence of
divorce, extempore marriages, and filial revolt. Public spirit, which in
1789 had risen to rare heights of patriotism and courage, was dying in a
people weary of revolution and war, skeptical of every leader, and
cynical of its own hopes. Here was a situation that called not for
politics but for statesmanship, and not for leisurely democratic debate
in spacious assemblies, but (as Marat had foreseen and urged) for
dictatorship — for a combination of large perspec- tives, objective
thought, tireless labor, discerning tact, and commanding will. The
condition prescribed Napoleon.</p>
<p>At their first sitting Ducos proposed that the thirty-year-old
general</p>
<p>should take the chair. Bonaparte soothed Sieyes by arranging that
each of the three should preside in turn, and suggesting that Sieyes
should take the lead in formulating a new constitution. The aging
theorist retired to his study and left Napoleon (Ducos complaisant) to
issue decrees calculated to secure</p>
<p>i59</p>
<p>i6o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>order in the administration, solvency in the Treasury, patience among
fac- tions, and a term of trust from a people disturbed by the forcible
usurpation of power.</p>
<p>One of the ruling Consul’s first acts was to put away his military
uniform, and to adopt a modest civilian dress; he was to be a master of
theater. He announced his intention, as soon as the new government
should be estab- lished, to propose terms of pacification to England and
Austria. His apparent ambition in those early days was not to drive
England to surrender, but to quiet and strengthen France. He was at this
time what Pitt was to call him, the Son of the Revolution — its product
and protector, the consolidator of its economic gains; but he made it
clear, too, that he wished to be the end of the Revolution — the healer
of its internal strife, the organizer of its pros- perity and peace.</p>
<p>He pleased the bourgeoisie — whose economic support was to be indis-
pensable to his power — by condemning to deportation (November 17, 1799)
thirty-eight individuals considered dangerous to the public peace; this
was dictatorship with a vengeance, which aroused more murmurs than
applause; soon he modified the decree to banishment in the provinces. 1
He rescinded the confiscatory tax, of twenty to thirty percent, which
the Directory had levied upon all incomes above a moderate level. He
revoked the law by which prominent citizens were kept under watch as
hostages to be fined or deported for any antigovernment crimes committed
in their localities. He pacified the Catholics of the Vendee by inviting
their leaders to a confer- ence, offering them assurances of goodwill,
and signing with them (Decem- ber 24) a truce that for a time put an end
to the religious wars. He ordered all Catholic churches that had been
consecrated before 1793 to be restored to Catholic worship on all days
except the decadi. 2 On, or soon after, December 26 he recalled from
banishment the victims of triumphant Revo- lutionary factions: former
liberals of the National Assembly, including Lafayette; defused members
of the Committee of Public Safety, like Barere; conservatives proscribed
by the coup d’etat of the 18th Fructidor, like Lazare Carnot, who
returned to his labors in the Ministry of War. Bona- parte restored
civic rights to well-behaved nobles, and to the peaceful rela- tives of
Emigres. He put an end to the hate-feeding festivals like those that
celebrated the execution of Louis XVI, the proscription of the
Girondins, and the fall of Robespierre. He announced that he proposed to
govern in the interest not of any one part — Jacobin, bourgeois, or
royalist — but as a repre- sentative of the entire nation. “To govern in
the interest of a party,” he declared, “is sooner or later to be
dependent upon it. They will never get me to do it. I am national.”
3</p>
<p>And so the people of France came to view him — nearly all but jealous
gen- erals and immovable Jacobins. As early as November 13 public
opinion had turned decisively in his favor. “Every previous revolution,”
wrote the Prus - sian ambassador to his government on that day, “had
inspired much distrust and fear. This one, on the contrary, as I myself
can testify, has cheered the spirits of everyone, and has wakened the
liv eliest hopes.” 4 On November 17</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>he Bourse had fallen to eleven francs; on the 20th it rose to
fourteen; on the 2 1 st, to twenty. 5</p>
<p>When Sieyes brought to the other Consuls his plan for a “Constitution
of the Year VIII” (1799) they soon saw that the former midwife of the
Revo - lution had lost much of that admiration for the Third Estate
which had in- spired his challenging pamphlet of a decade back. He was
now quite certain that no constitution could long uphold a state if the
roots of both lay in the fluent will of an uninformed and emotional
multitude. France had then almost no secondary schools, and its press
was an agent of passionate parti- sanship that deformed, rather than
informed, the public mind. His new constitution aimed to protect the
state from popular ignorance at one end and despotic rule at the other.
He half succeeded.</p>
<p>Napoleon revised Sieyes’ proposals, but accepted most of them, for he
too was in no mood for democracy. He did not conceal his opinion that
the people were not equipped to decide wisely about candidates or
policies; they were too amenable to personal charm, declamatory
eloquence, bought periodicals, or Rome-oriented priests. The people
themselves, he thought, would recognize their unfitness to meet the
problems of government; they would be content if the new constitution as
a whole should be submitted to them for acceptance or rejection in a
general referendum. Sieyes now reformulated his political philosophy i n
a basic maxim: “Confidence ought to come from below; power ought to come
from above.” 6</p>
<p>He began with a brief bow to democracy. All Frenchmen aged twenty-
one or more were to vote for one tenth of their number to be communal
notables; these were to vote for one tenth of their number to be depart-
mental notables; these to vote for one tenth of their number to be
national notables. There democracy ended: local officials were to be
appointed from — not elected by — communal notables; departmental
officials were to be ap- pointed from departmental notables; national
officials, from national nota- bles. All appointments were to be made by
the central government.</p>
<p>This was to consist of ( 1 ) a Conseil d’Ftat, or Council of State,
usually twenty-five men appointed by the chief of state, and authorized
to propose new laws to (2) a Tribunat of one hundred tribunes authorized
to discuss the measures so proposed, and to present its recommendations
to (3) a Corps Legislatif, or Legislature, of three hundred men
authorized to reject, or to enact into law — but not to discuss — the
measures so submitted; (4) a Senat, usually of eighty men of mature
mind, authorized to annul laws judged by it to be unconstitutional, to
appoint the members of the Tribunate and the Legislature, to recruit new
members for itself from the national notables, and to accept new members
appointed to it by (5) the “grand elector.”</p>
<p>This was the term that Sieyes had proposed for the head of the state,
but Napoleon rejected the term and its description. He saw in the
office, as Sieyes proceeded to describe it, a mere executive agent of
laws passed with- out his participation or consent, and a starched
figurehead to receive dele- gations and diplomats, and preside at
official ceremonies. He felt no talent for such rituals; on the
contrary, his head was swelling with proposals that</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>he was resolved to transform into laws as soon as possible for a
nation crying out for order, direction, and continuity. “Your Grand
Elector,” he told Sieyes, “is a do -nothing king, and the time of such
rois faineants is gone. What man of head and heart would submit to such
a sluggish life at the price of six million francs and an apartment in
the Tuileries? What? — nominate persons who act, and not act oneself? It
is inadmissible.” 7 He demanded the right to initiate legislation, to
issue ordinances, to appoint to office in the central government not
only from national notables, but wherever he found willing competence.
His program of political, economic, and social recon- struction required
a guaranteed tenure of ten years. And he wished to be called not “grand
elector,” which savored of Prussia, but “first consul,” which carried
the aroma of ancient Rome. Sieyes saw his constitution falling into
monarchy, but was mollified by the presidency of the Senate and lucra-
tive estates. He and Ducos resigned as consuls, and were replaced, at
Napo- leon’s request (December 12, 179 9), by Jean-Jacques Cambaceres as
second consul, and Charles-Frangois Lebrun as third.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to class these two men as mere obedient
function- aries. Each was a man of tried ability. Cambaceres, who had
been minister of justice under the Directory, served now as legal
counselor to Napoleon. He presided over the Senate, and (in the absence
of the First Consul) over the Council of State. He played a leading role
in formulating the Code Napo- leon. He was a bit vain, and proud of the
Lucullan dinners that he served; but his calm and thoughtful temper
often saved the First Consul from im- petuous mistakes. He warned
Napoleon not to antagonize Spain, and to avoid Russia as a mattress
grave. — Lebrun had been secretary to Rene de Maupeou in the effort to
avert the bankruptcy of Bourbon France; he had shared in the financial
legislation of the National Assembly and the Direc- tory; now starting
with an empty Treasury, he helped to organize the finances of the new
government. Napoleon appreciated the quality of these men; when he
became emperor he made Lebrun archtreasurer and Cam- baceres
archchancellor, and they remained faithful to him to the end.</p>
<p>Despite his conviction that the condition of France required early
deci- sions and quick implementation of policies, Napoleon, in this
freshman year of his course, submitted his proposals to the Council of
State, heard them attacked and defended, and took an active part in the
discussion. This was a new role for him; he was accustomed to command
rather than to debate, and his thoughts now often outran his words: but
he learned quickly and worked arduously, in and out of Council, to
analyze problems and find solu- tions. He was as yet only “Gtoyen -
Consul,” and allowed himself t o be over- ruled. 8 The leaders of the
Council — like Portalis, Roederer,. Thibaudeau — were men of high
caliber, not to be dictated to; and their memoirs abound in tributes to
the Consul’s willingness to work. Hear Roederer:</p>
<p>Punctual at every sitting, prolonging the session five or six hours,…
always returning to the question, “Is that just? Is that useful?”…

<p>he Council adjourn without its members knowing more than the day
before — if not through knowledge derived from him, at least through the
researches he obliged them to make…. What characterizes him above them
all… [is] the force, flexibility, and constancy of his attention. I
never saw him tired. I never found his mind lacking in inspiration, even
when weary in body…. Never did man more wholly devote himself to the
work in hand, nor better devote his time to what he had to do. 9</p>
<p>In those days one could have loved Napoleon.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Ministers</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides arranging for legislation to govern France, he attended to
the still more difficult task of administration. He divided the work
among eight min- istries, and chose as their heads the ablest men he
could find, regardless of their party or their past; some had been
Jacobins, some Girondins, some royalists. In one or two cases he allowed
personal fondness to overrule prac- tical judgment; so he made Laplace
minister of the interior, but soon found the great mathematician-
astronomer bringing “the spirit of infinitesimals into administration”;
10 he transferred him to the Senate, and gave the ministry to brother
Lucien.</p>
<p>The basic and almost desperate task of the Ministry of the Interior
was to restore the solvency and vitality of the communes or
municipalities as the foundation cells of the body politic. Napoleon
expressed himself on their condition in a letter to Lucien on December
25, 1799:</p>
<p>Since 1790 the 36,000 local bodies have been like 36,000 orphan
girls. Heir- esses of the old feudal rights, they [the communes] have
been neglected or defrauded… by the municipal trustees of the Convention
or the Directory. A new set of mayors, assessors, or municipal
councilors has generally meant nothing more than a fresh form of
robbery: they have stolen the byroad, stolen the footpath, stolen the
timber, robbed the church, and filched the property of the commune…. If
this system were to last another ten years, what would become of local
bodies? They would inherit nothing but debts, and be so bankrupt that
they would be asking charity of the inhabitants. 11</p>
<p>This was Napoleon in a literary mood, and so a bit exaggerated. If
true it might have suggested that the communes should be allowed to
choose their own officials, as in Paris. But Napoleon had no liking for
what the result had been in Paris. As for lesser communes, “the
Revolution,” in the judgment of its latest historian, “had unearthed but
few villagers well enough educated and cultivated to possess a sense of
integrity and public interest”; 12 and too often such locally chosen
rulers, like those sent from Paris, had proved to be incompetent or
corrupt or both. So Napoleon remained deaf to appeals for communal
self-rule. Going back to the Roman consular system, or to the intendants
of the late Bourbons, he preferred to appoint — or to have the Interior
Ministry appoint — to each departement a ruling prefect, to each
arrondissement a subprefect, and to each commune a mayor; each appointee
to be responsible to his superior, and ultimately to the central
government. “All of the prefects” so appointed “were men of wide
experience, and most</p>
<p>164 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>were very capable.” 13 In any case they gave Napoleon far -reaching
reins of power.</p>
<p>The civil service — the total administrative body — in Napoleonic
France was the least democratic and the most efficient known to history,
with the possible exception of ancient Rome. The people resisted the
system, but it proved to be a defensible corrective of their acquisitive
individualism; the restored Bourbons and the successive French republics
retained it; and it gave the country a hidden and basic continuity
through a century of politi- cal and cultural turmoil. “France lives
today,” wrote Vandal in 1903, “in the administrative frame and under the
civil laws which Napoleon bequeathed to her.”</p>
<p>A more immediate problem was the rehabilitation of the Treasury. On
the recommendation of Consul Lebrun, Napoleon offered the Ministry of
Fi- nance to Martin-Michel Gaudin, who had refused that post under the
Direc- tory and had acquired a reputation for ability and honesty. His
accession to the ministry guaranteed the support of the financial
community for the new government. Substantial loans now came to the
rescue of the state: one banker advanced 500,000 francs in gold, and
asked no interest. Soon the Treasury had twelve million francs with
which to pay its operating ex- penses and (always a first care with
Napoleon) to feed and content the Army, poorly clothed and long unpaid.
Gaudin at once transferred from local officials to the central
government the power to assess and collect taxes; local corruption in
these processes had been notorious. On February 13, 1800, Gaudin united
various financial agencies into one Bank of France, financed by selling
shares, and empowered to issue paper currency; soon the careful
management of the bank made its notes as popular and trustworthy as
cash. This in itself was a revolution. The bank was not a state
institution; it remained in private hands; but it was buttressed, and
partly controlled, by governmental revenues deposited there; and a
Minister of the Treasury, Barbe-Marbois, was added to the Ministry of
Finance to guard and manage state funds in the bank.</p>
<p>The most disagreeable part of administration was the prevention,
detec- tion, and punishment of crime, and the protection of governmental
officials from assassination. Joseph Fouche was just the man for this
work; he had had much experience with many forms of skulduggery; and, as
a regicide marked out for vengeance by the royalists, he could be relied
upon to pro- tect Napoleon as the strongest barrier against a Bourbon
restoration. While Gaudin coddled the bankers, Fouche kept the Jacobins
in line with hopes that the First Consul would be a true son of the
Revolution — protecting the commonalty against aristocracy and clergy,
and France against reactionary powers. Napoleon distrusted and feared
Fouche, and maintained a separate force of spies whose duties included
spying upon the Minister of Police; but he was long at a loss to replace
him. He did this gingerly in 1802, restored him in 1804, kept him till
1810. He appreciated Fouche’s moderation in ask - ing for funds, and
winked at the sly Minister’s partial financing of his force by
confiscations from gambling casinos and contributions from brothels.
14</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>l6 5</p>
<p>A separate gendarmerie kept watch over streets, stores, offices, and
homes, and presumably shared in the income of its wards.</p>
<p>The defense of the individual — even of the criminal — against the
police, the law, and the state did not get as much attention in France
as in the Eng- land of that time, but some of it was provided by a
judiciary efficient and relatively free from the correlation of
judgments with gifts. In assigning this branch of administration to the
jurist Andre- Joseph Abrimal, Napoleon said: “Citizen, I do not know
you, but I am told you are the honestest man in the magistracy, and that
is why I name you Minister of Justice.” 15 Soon France was covered with
an abundance and diversity of courts, with grand and petty juries,
justices of the peace, bailiffs, prosecutors, plaintiffs, notaries,
advocates…</p>
<p>The protection of the state from other states was assigned to a
Ministry of War under General Louis-Alexander Berthier, a Ministry of
Marine under Denis Deeres, and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ministere
des Relations Exterieures) under the indestructible Talleyrand. He was
now forty-five years old, with an established reputation for polished
manners, intellectual penetration, and moral depravity. We last saw him
(July 14, 1790) cele- brating Holy Mass at the Champ-de-Mars festival;
shortly afterward he wrote to his latest acquisition, Adelaide de
Filleul, Comtesse de Flahaut: “I hope you feel to what divinity I
yesterday addressed my prayers and my oath of fidelity. You alone are
the Supreme Being whom I adore, and will always adore.” 16 He had a son
by the Countess, but he quietly attended her wedding as the unseen giver
of the bride. 17 His passion for feminine beauty was naturally
accompanied by an appetite for francs, on which beauty lived. Since he
rejected the Christian ethic as well as the Catholic theology, he ad-
justed his eloquence to lucrative causes, and earned a pretty bouquet
from Carnot:</p>
<p>Talleyrand brings with him all the vices of the old regime, without
having been able to acquire any of the virtues of the new one. He has no
fixed princi- ples; he changes them as he does his linen, and takes them
according to the wind of the day — a philosopher when philosophy is the
mode; a republican now because that is necessary in order to become
anything; tomorrow he will declare for an absolute monarchy if he can
make anything out of it. I don’t want him at any price.</p>
<p>Mirabeau agreed: “For money Talleyrand would sell his so ul — and he
would be right, for he would be trading muck for gold.” 18</p>
<p>There was, however, a limit to Talleyrand’s gyrations. When the mob
ejected the King and Queen from the Tuileries and set up a proletarian
dic- tatorship, he made no curtsies to the new masters, but took a boat
to England (September 17, 1792). He received a mixed reception there:
warm from Joseph Priestley and Jeremy Bentham, George Canning and
Charles James Fox; 19 cool from aristocrats remembering his share in the
Revolution. In March, 1794, English tolerance ran out, and Talleyrand
was ordered to leave the country within twenty-four hours. He sailed to
the United States,</p>

investments, returned to France (August, 1796), and became foreign

<li>under the Directory. In that capacity he added to his fortune by di-
verse means, so that he was able to deposit three million francs in
British and German banks. Foreseeing the fall of the Directory, he
resigned (July 20, 1799), and waited in comfort for Napoleon to call him
back to office. The Consul did not wait long; on November 22, 1799,
Talleyrand was again ministre des relations exterieures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonaparte found him valuable as an intermediary between an upstart
ruler and decaying kings. Through all his revolutions Talleyrand had
preserved the dress, manners, speech, and mind of the old aristocracy:
the easy grace (despite the twisted foot), the imperturbable composure,
the subtle wit of a man who knew that at need he could kill with an
epigram. He was a hard worker, a shrewd diplomat, who could rephrase in
courteous elegance the impetuous bluntness of his unvarn ished master.
He made a principle “never to hurry” in reaching a decision 20 — a good
motto for a lame man; in several instances his delays in forwarding a
dispatch allowed Napoleon to recede from dangerous absolutes.</p>
<p>He wanted, under whatever banner, to live lavishly, seduce leisurely,
and gather plums from any tree. When the Consul asked him how he had
amassed so great a fortune, he answered disarmingly, “I bought stocks on
the seventeenth Brumaire, and sold them three days later.” 21 That was
but a beginning; within fourteen months of resuming office he added
fifteen million francs more. He played the market from “inside”
knowledge, and he gathered “tidbits” from foreign powers who exaggerated
his influence upon Napoleon’s policies. By the end of the Consulate his
fortune was estimated at forty million francs. 22 Napoleon found him
revolting and irreplaceable. Echoing Mirabeau, he called the graceful
cripple “ merde in a silk stock - ing,” 23 using a term that carries
less odor in French than in its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Napoleon himself
was above bribery, having acquired the French Treasury, and France.</p>

<li>The Reception of the Constitution</li>
</ol>
<p>The new constitution met with much criticism when it was published
(December 15, 1799) with the ingratiating claim, “It is founded on the
true</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>lition of feudal dues and ecclesiastical tithes; theoretically, and
subject to nature, it established the equality of all citizens before
the law and in eligi- bility to any career — political, economic, or
cultural; it set up a strong central</p>
<p>Nevertheless there were complaints. The Jacobins felt that they had
been ignored in the “Constitution of the Year VIII”— that the
“representative gov - ernment” which it offered was a hypocritical
surrender of the Revolution to the bourgeoisie. Several generals
wondered why fate had not chosen one of them, instead of that puny
Corsican, for political supremacy; “there was not one of the generals
who did not conspire against me.” 25 The Catholics mourned that the
constitution confirmed the Revolution’s confiscation of church property;
rebellion rose again in the Vendee (1800). Royalists fretted because
Napoleon was consolidating his position instead of calling Louis XVIII
to restore Bourbon rule. As the royalists controlled most of the
newspapers, 26 they launched a campaign against acceptance of the new
re- gime; Napoleon replied (January 17, 1800) by suppressing sixty out
of the seventy-three existing journals of France, on the ground that
they were financed by foreign gold. The radical press was also reduced,
and the Moni- teur became the official organ of the government.
Journalists, authors, and philosophers condemned this attack upon the
freedom of the press; and now Mme. de Stael, having given up hope of
playing Egeria, began a powerful and lifelong attack upon Napoleon as a
dictator who was crucifying French liberty.</p>
<p>Napoleon defended himself by proxy in the Moniteur. He had not de-
stroyed liberty; this had already been shattered by the need for
centralized government in war, by the rigged elections of the Jacobins,
by the dictator- ship of rioting mobs, and by the repeated coups d’etat
of the Directory years; and what remained of it had been dragged in the
mire of political bribery and moral decay. The liberty he was crucifying
was the freedom of the crowd to be lawless, of the criminal to steal and
kill, of the propa- gandist to lie, of the judge to take bribes, of the
financier to embezzle, of the businessman to play monopoly. Had not
Marat advocated — had not the Committee of Public Safety practiced —
dictatorship as the only cure for the chaos of a society suddenly
released from religious tutelage, class domina- tion, and royal
autocracy, and left to the urgency of instincts and the tyr- anny of
crowds? Some discipline must now be found to reestablish that order
which is the precondition of freedom. 27</p>
<p>The peasantry did not need such arguments to decide their support of
the constitution; they had the land, and secretly applauded any
government that would squelch the Jacobins. Here, despite opposite
economic interests, the city proletariat agreed with the tillers of the
soil. The people of the tene- ments — workers in the factories, clerks
in the shops, peddlers in the streets —</p>
<p>168 THEAGEOFNAPOLEON ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>hose who as sansculottes had fought for bread and power, had lost
faith in a Revolution that had lifted them up, thrown them down, and
left them shorn of hope; one magic still stirred them — the hero of war;
and the con- queror of Italy could be no worse than the politicians of
the Directory. And as for the bourgeoisie — bankers, merchants,
businessmen — how could tney re- ject the man who had so completely
accepted the sanctity of property and freedom of enterprise? With mm
they had won the Revolution and inherited France. He was, till 1810,
their man.</p>
<p>Confident that the great majority would support him, Napoleon sub-
mitted the new constitution to a plebiscite (December 24, 1799). We do
not know if this referendum was managed and manacled like so many
similar polls before or since. The official count reported 3,011,107 in
favor of the constitution, 1,562 against it. 28</p>
<p>Having those ayes behind him, Napoleon, with his family and
aides,</p>
<p>moved from the crowded Luxembourg to the royal and commodious
Tuileries (February 19, 1800). He made the transit in a pompous
procession with three thousand troops, generals on horseback, ministers
in carriages, the Council of State in hackney coaches, and the First
Consul in a coach drawn by six white horses. It was the first example of
the many public displays with which Napoleon hoped to impress the public
of Paris. He explained to his secretary:</p>
<p>“Bourrienne, tonight at last we shall sleep in the T uileries. You
are better off than I: you are not obliged to make a spectacle of
yourself, but may go your own way there. I must, however, go in
procession; that disgusts me, but it is necessary to speak to the eyes….
In the Army simplicity is in the proper place; but in a great city, in a
palace, the Chief of the Government must attract attention in every
possible way, yet still with prudence.” 29</p>
<p>The ritual was triumphantly completed with but one disturbing note:
on one of the guardhouses through which Napoleon passed into the
courtyard of the palace he could have seen a large inscription reading
“Tenth of Au - gust, 1792 — Royalty in France is abolished, and shall
never be restored.” 30 As they walked through the rooms that had once
displayed the wealth of the Bourbons, State Councilor Roederer remarked
to the First Consul, “ General , - cela est triste” (General, this is
sad); to which Napoleon replied, “Out, coTrnne la gloire” (Yes, like
glory). 31 For his work with Bourrienne he chose a spacious chamber
adorned only with books. When he was shown the royal bedroom and bed, he
refused to use them, preferring to sleep regularly with Josephine.
However, that evening, not without pride, he said to his wife, “Come
along, my little Creole, go he down in the bed of your masters.” 32</p>

<li>THE CAMPAIGNS OF THE CONSULATE</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon had established internal order, and conditions that promised
an economic resurgence; but it still remained that France was surrounded
by enemies in a war that France had begun on April 20, 1792. The French
peo-</p>

<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>pie longed for peace, but refused to abandon the territories that had
been annexed during the Revolution: Avignon, Belgium, the left bank of
the Rhine, Basel, Geneva, Savoy, and Nice. Nearly all of these were
comprised in what the French called the “natural boundaries” of their
country; and Napoleon, in the oath that he had taken on coming to power,
had pledged himself to protect these borders — the Rhine, the Alps, the
Pyrenees, and the seas — as essentially a return to the boundaries of
ancient Gaul. Moreover, France had taken Holland, Italy, Malta, and
Egypt; was she willing to give up these conquests as the price of peace,
or would she soon reject any leader who negotiated the surrender of
these profitable gains? The character of the French united with the
character of Napoleon in a policy proud with na- tionalism and pregnant
with war.</p>
<p>An escape from this destiny was suggested to Napoleon in a letter of
February 20, 1800, from the man whom nearly all emigres and royalists
recognized as the legitimate ruler of France — Louis XVIII:</p>
<p>Whatever may be their apparent conduct, men like you never inspire
alarm. You have accepted an eminent station, and I thank you for having
done so. You know better than anyone how much strength and power are
requisite to secure the happiness of a great nation. Save France from
her violence, and you will fulfill the first wish of my heart. Restore
her King to her, and future gen- erations will bless your memory. You
will always be too necessary to the state for me ever to be able to
discharge, by important appointments, the debt of my family and
myself.</p>
<p>Louis 33</p>
<p>Napoleon let this appeal remain unanswered. How could he return the
throne to a man who had promised his faithful followers to follow his
own restoration with that of the status quo ante the Revolution? What
would happen to the enfranchised peasants, or to the buyers of church
property? What would happen to Napoleon? Already the royalists, who were
daily plotting to remove him, were announcing what they would do to this
up- start who dared to play king without ointment or pedigree. 34</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, 1799, the day after the plebiscite had sanctioned
his rule, Napoleon wrote to King George III of England:</p>
<p>Called by the will of the French people to hold the highest office in
the Re- public, I think it proper, on assuming my functions, to inform
Your Majesty of the fact by my own hand.</p>
<p>Is there to be no end to the war which, for the past eight years, has
dislo- cated every quarter of the globe? Is there no means by which we
can come to an understanding? How is it that the two most enlightened
nations in Eu- rope, both stronger and more powerful than their safety
and independence require, consent to sacrifice their commercial success,
their internal prosperity, and the happiness of their homes, to dreams
of imaginary greatness? How is it that they do not envisage peace as
their greatest glory as well as their greatest need?</p>
<p>Such sentiments cannot be strange to Your Majesty’s heart, for you
rule a free nation for the sole end of making it happy.</p>
<p>I beg Your Majesty to believe that in broaching this subject, it is
my sincere</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>desire to make a practical contribution… toward a generous peace….
The fate of every civilized nation depends upon the ending of a war
which is em- broiling the whole world. 35</p>
<p>George III did not think it fitting that a king should answer a
commoner; he delegated the task to Lord Grenville, who sent to
Talleyrand (January 3,</p>
<ol start="1800" type="1">
<li>a sharp ndte denouncing the aggressions of France and declaring that
England could not entey into negotiations except through the Bourbons,
who must be restored as a precondition to any peace. A letter of
Napoleon to Emperor Francis II received a similar reply from the
Austrian Chancellor, Baron Franz von Thugut. Probably these literary
reverses had been dis- counted; Napoleon did not have to be told that
statesmen weigh words by counting guns. The reality remained that an
Austrian army had recaptured north Italy and reached Nice, and that a
French army, imprisoned in Egypt by the British and Turks, was nearing
surrender or destruction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kleber, brave and brilliant general, unsuccessful diplomat, expected
no re- lief, and openly shared in the despondency of his men. By his
orders General Desaix signed at El ’Arish (January 24, 1800), with the
Turks and the local English commander, a convention for the safe and
orderly departure of the French, with their arms and baggage and the
“honors of war,” on ships to be supplied by the Turks to convey them to
France; meanwhile the French were to deliver to the Turks the forts that
had protected the Europeans from Egyptian revolts. These forts had been
surrendered when word came from the British government refusing to
accept the terms of evacuation, and insisting that the French lay down
their arms and yield themselves up as prisoners of war. Kleber refused
to do this, and demanded the return of the forts; the Turks would not
agree to this, and advanced upon Cairo. Kleber led his ten thousand men
to meet the Turks, twenty thousand strong, on the plains of Heliopolis.
He revived the ardor of his troops with a simple mes- sage: “You possess
in Egypt no more than the ground under your feet. If you recoil but one
step you are undone.” 36 After t wo days (March 20-21,</p>
<ol start="1800" type="1">
<li>of batde the wild courage of the Turks yielded to the disciplined
tac- tics of the French, and the surviving victors returned to Cairo to
wait again for help from France.</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon could send them no rescue while Britain ruled the Mediter-
ranean. But he had to do something about the fact that the seventy-one-
year- old General Baron von Melas had led 100,000 of Austria’s best
soldiers in a victorious advance through north Italy to Milan. Napoleon
sent Massena to stop him; Massena was defeated, and found refuge for his
troops in the citadel of Genoa. Melas left a force to besiege him there,
assigned additional detachments to guard the Alpine passes against
attacks from France, and proceeded along the Italian Riviera until his
vanguard reached Nice (April, 1 800). The tables had been turned upon
Napoleon: the city from which he had begun his conquest of Lombardy in 1
796 was now in the hands of the nation he had defeated — while the
better part of his famous Army of Italy, too sanguinely divided, was
wasting away, helpless and desperate, in Egypt. It was the most direct
challenge that Napoleon had yet received.</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>I?I</p>
<p>He put administration aside, and became again the commander in chief,
raising money, troops, materiel, and morale, organizing supplies,
studying maps, dispatching directives to his generals. To Moreau — the
most outspoken of his martial foes — he entrusted the Army of the Rhine,
with merciless in- structions: cross the Rhine, cut your way through the
Austrian divisions under Marshal Krug; then send 25,000 of your men over
the St. Gotthard Pass into Italy to reinforce the Army of Reserve that
Napoleon promised to have waiting for them near Milan. Moreau did most
of this heroically, but felt, perhaps justly, that in his hazardous
position he could spare to his chief only fifteen thousand men.</p>
<p>Of all the campaigns of history’s greatest general, this of 1800 was
the most subtly planned, and the most poorly executed. Under his direct
com- mand he had only forty thousand men, mostly conscripts unhardened
to war. Stationed near Dijon, they might have moved south over the
Maritime Alps to Nice for a frontal attack upon Melas; but they were too
few and raw; and even if Melas were defeated in such an engagement he
would have a protected line of retreat through north Italy to
well-fortified Mantua. In- stead, Napoleon proposed to lead his troops
and their equipment over the St. Bernard Pass into Lombardy, unite with
the men expected from Moreau, cut Melas’ lines of communication,
overcome the Austrian detachments guarding that line, and catch th e old
hero’s army in disarray as it hurried back from the Riviera and Genoa
toward Milan. Then he would destroy it or be destroyed; best of all, he
would surround it, prevent its retreat, and compel its general — all
courtesies observed — to surrender all north Italy. The Cisalpine
Republic, pride of Napoleon’s first campaigns, would be restored to its
French allegiance.</p>
<p>One day (March 17, 1800), Napoleon bade Bourrienne unfold upon the
floor a large map of Italy. “He lay down upon it, and desired me to do
like- wise.” Upon certain points he inserted pins with red heads, upon
other points pins tinged black. After moving the pins around into
various combi- nations, he asked his secretary, “Where do you think I
shall beat Melas?… Here in the pla ins of the [River] Scrivia,” and he
pointed to San Giuliano. 37 He knew that he was staking everything — all
his victories military and po- litical — upon one battle; but his pride
sustained him. “Four years ago,” he reminded Bourrienne, “did I not with
a feeble army drive before me hordes of Sardinians and Austrians and
scour the face of Italy? We shall do so again. The sun which now shines
upon us is the same that shone at Arcole and Lodi. I rely on Massena. I
hope he will hold out in Genoa. But should famine compel him to
surrender, I will retake Genoa and the plains of the Scrivia. With what
pleasure shall I then return to mv dear France, ma belle France /”
38</p>
<p>He added preparation to foresight, and did not disdain attention to
trivial details. He planned the route and the conveyances: Dijon to
Geneva; by boat over the lake to Villeneuve; by horse, mule, carriage,
charabanc, or on foot to Martigny; thence to St.-Pierre at the base of
the pass; then over the mountain on thirty miles of road sometimes only
three feet wide, often along</p>
<p>I?2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>precipices usually covered with snow, and subject at any moment to
ava- lanches of snow, earth , or rock; then into the Valle d’ Aosta. At
every stage of this route Napoleon arranged to have food, clothing, and
transport wait- ing for the men; at several points carpenters, saddlers,
and other workmen were to be made available for repair work; and twice
en route every soldier was examined to see if he was properly equipped.
To the monks who lived in the hospice at the summit he sent money for
bread, cheese, and wine with which to revive the soldiers. Despite all
these preparations many shortages turned up; but those young conscripts
seem to have borne them with a pa- tience inspired by the silent courage
of the veterans.</p>
<p>Napoleon left Paris on May 6, 1800. He had hardly disappeared when
royalists, Jacobins, and Bonapartes began to replace him in case he
should not return triumphant. Sieyes and others discussed the
qualifications of Carnot, Lafayette, and Moreau as a new First Consul;
and Napoleon’s broth - ers Joseph and Lucien offered themselves as heirs
apparent to the throne. Georges Cadoudal returned from England (June 3)
to stir revolt among the Chouans.</p>
<p>The actual encounter with the St. Bernard Pass began on May 14. “We
all proceeded along the goat paths, m an and horse one by one,”
Bourrienne re - called. “The artillery was dismounted, and the guns, put
into excavated tree</p>
<p>Both commanders violated a prime principle of strategy — not to
divide their available forces beyond possibility of quick reunion. Baron
von Melas, stationed with his main army at Alessandria (between Milan
and Genoa), left garrisons at Genoa, Savona, Gavi, Acqui, Turin,
Tortona, and other points of possible French attack. His rear guard,
moving back from Nice to join him, was harassed by 20,000 Frenchmen
under Suchet and Massena — who had escaped from Genoa. Of the 70,000
Austrians who had crossed the Apennines from Lombardy into Liguria, only
40,000 were now available to</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>Melas for meeting Napoleon. Part of these he sent to recapture
Piacenza as an indispensable avenue of escape to Mantua if his main army
should be de- feated. Napoleon also divided his forces perilously:
32,000 he left at Stradella to guard Piacenza; 9,000 at Tessino, 3,000
at Milan, 10,000 along the course of the Po and the Adda. He sacrificed
the union of his army to the desire to close all roads of escape for
Melas’ men.</p>
<p>His generals cooperated in saving this policy of impasse from leaving
Napoleon unprepared for the main battle. On June 9 Lannes led 8,000 men
out from Stradella, and encountered 18,000 Austrians making for
Piacenza. In a costly engagement at Casteggio the French were beaten
back, though Lannes, covered with blood, still fought in the van; but a
fresh force of 6,000 French arrived in time to turn the defeat into a
victory near Montebello. Two days later Napoleon was gladdened by the
arrival, from Egypt, of one of his most beloved generals, Louis Desaix,
“who perhaps equaled Moreau, Massena, Kleber, and Lannes in military
talents, but surpassed them all in the rare perfection of his
character.” 40 On June 13 Napoleon sent him south to Novi with 5,000
men, to check on a rumor that Melas and his men were escaping to Genoa,
where a British fleet could have given them escape, or reinforcement
with food and materiel. So Napoleon’s main army was still further
diminished when, on June 14, the crucial battle came.</p>
<p>It was Melas who chose the spot. Near Marengo, a village on the Ales-
sandria-Piacenza road, he observed an immense plain on which he could
bring into united action the 35,000 men still available to him, and
their two hundred pieces of. artillery. However, when Napoleon reached
this plain (June 13), he found no evidence that Melas was planning to
venture out of Alessandria. He left at Marengo two divisions under
General Victor, and one under Lannes, with Murat’s cavalry and only
twenty -four cannon. He himself turned with his Consular Guard toward
Voghera, where he had arranged to meet his staff officers from his
scattered armies. When he came to the Scrivia he found it so swollen by
spring floods that he postponed his passage, and slept at Torre di
Garofolo. It was a lucky delay; if he had gone on to Voghera he might
never have reached Marengo in time to give the order that saved the
day.</p>
<p>Early on June 14 Melas ordered his army to advance upon Marengo
plain, and to fight its way through to Piacenza. Thirty thousand men
surprised the 20,000 of Victor, Lannes, and Moreau; the French, despite
their usual hero- ism, fell back before a decimating artillery barrage.
Napoleon, awakened at Garofolo by the sound of distant cannon, sent a
courier to call Desaix back from Novi; he himself rushed to Marengo.
There the 800 grenadiers of his Guard plunged into the battle, but could
not stop the Austrians; the French continued their retreat to San
Giuliano. Melas, anxious to reassure the Em- peror, sent a message to
Vienna announcing victory. The same report was spread about Paris, to
the consternation of the populace and the joy of the royalists.</p>
<p>They reckoned without Desaix. He too, on the road to Novi, heard the
rumble of cannon. He turned back his 5,000 men at once, followed the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>sound, marched rapidly, reached San Giuliano by 3 p.m., and found his
brother generals advising Napoleon to further retreat. Desaix protested;
they told him, “The battle is lost”; he replied: “Yes, the battle is
lost, but it is only three o’clock; there is time to win another.” 41
They yielded; Napoleon orga - nized a new line of attack, and rode among
the troops to restore their spirit. Desaix led the action, exposed
himself, was shot and fell from his horse; dying, he bade his next in
command, “Conceal my death; it might dishearten the troops”; 42 on the
contrary, havi ng learned of it, they rushed ahead, shouting that they
would avenge their leader. Even so, they encountered al- most immovable
resistance. Seeing this, Napoleon sent word to Kellermann to go to the
rescue with the full force of his cavalry. Kellermann and his men fell
upon the flank of the Austrians with a wild fury that cut it in two;
2,000 of them surrendered; General von Zach, commanding in place of the
absent Melas, was taken prisoner, and delivered his sword to Napoleon.
Melas, summoned from Alessandria, came too late to affect the result; he
re- turned to his headquarters brokenhearted.</p>
<p>Napoleon could not quite rejoice. He bore as a deep personal loss the
death of the devoted Desaix; and many other officers were among the
6,000 Frenchmen who lay dead on Marengo plain. It was no comfort that
8,000 Austrians had died there on that day; these were a smaller
percentage of the Austrians engaged than were the dead among the
French.*</p>
<p>On June 15 Baron von Melas, seeing that the remnants of his armies
were in no condition to renew the battle, asked Napoleon for truce
terms. These were severe: the Austrians were to evacuate all Liguria and
Piedmont, and all Lombardy west of the Mincio and Mantua; they were to
turn over to the French all the fortresses in the surrendered regions;
the Austrian troops were to be allowed to leave with all the honors of
war, but only in proportion as the fortresses were placed in French
hands. Melas bowed to these conditions, which saw all his joyous
conquests annulled in one day, and sent to the Austrian Emperor a
petition to confirm the agreement. On June 16 Napoleon sent his own
message to Francis II, asking for a peace on all fronts. Some paragraphs
of that letter could have come from a pacifist:</p>
<p>There has been war between us. Thousands of Austrians and Frenchmen
are no more…. Thousands of bereaved families are praying that fathers,
hus- bands, and sons may return!… The evil is irremediable; may it at
least teach us to avoid anything that might prolong hostilities! The
prospect so affects my heart that I refuse to accept the failures of my
previous advances, and take it upon myself to write again to Your
Majesy, to entreat you to put an end to the misfortunes of Europe.</p>
<p>On the battlefield of Marengo, surrounded by sufferers, and in the
midst of 15,000 dead bodies, I implore Your Majesty to hear the cry of
humanity, and not to allow the offspring of two brave and powerful
nations to slaughter one another for the sake of interests of which they
know nothing….</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the difficulty of communication kept Napoleon from learning
that on the same day that Desaix concluded his career his former
commander, Kleber, was assassinated in Cairo. After another year of
resistance to Turkish-British-Mameluke attacks, the French won the right
to leave their prison (August, 1801) and return to France.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>The recent campaign is sufficient proof that it is not France which
threatens the balance of power. Every day shows that it is England —
England, who has so monopolized world commerce and the empire of the
seas that she can with- stand singlehanded the united fleets of Russia,
Sweden, Denmark, France, Spain, and Holland….</p>
<p>The proposals that I think it right to make to Your Majesty are
these:</p>
<p>( 1 ) That the armistice be extended to all armies.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>That negotiators be sent by both sides, either secretly or publicly,
as Your Majesty prefers, to some place between the Mincio and the
Chiese, to agree upon means of guaranteeing the lesser powers, and to
elucidate those articles of the Treaty of Campoformio which experience
has shown to be ambiguous…. 43</li>
</ol>
<p>The Emperor was not visibly impressed. Obviously the young conqueror
wished to consolidate his gains, but there was no indication that
respect for human life had ever interfered with his campaigns. Probably
neither the Consul nor the Emperor stopped to ask what either the French
or the Aus- trians were doing in Italy. Baron von Thugut settled the
matter by signing (June 20, 1800) a treaty by which England granted
Austria a new subsidy on her pledge to sign no separate peace. 44</p>
<p>Meanwhile Napoleon, playing all his cards, attended (July 18) a
solemn Te Deum Mass at which the Milanese hierarchy expressed thanks to
God for the expulsion of the Austrians. The laity celebrated the victory
with parades in honor of the victor. “Bourrienne,” he asked his
secretary, “do you hear the acclamations still resounding? That noise is
as sweet to me as the sound of Josephine’s voice. How happy and proud I
am to be loved by such a peo - ple!” 45 He was still an Italian, loving
the language, th e passion and beauty, the garlanded orchards, the
indulgent religion, the melodious ritual and transcendent arias. But he
was moved, too, by the plaudits of the crowds that gathered before the
Tuileries on July 3, the morning after his nocturnal return to Paris.
The people of France began to think of him as God’s favor - ite; they
drank eagerly from their cup of glory.</p>
<p>And Louis XVIII, heir to centuries of strife between Bourbon France
and Hapsburg Austria, could hardly be indifferent to this new victory
over old foes. Perhaps the young conqueror could still be persuaded to
be a king- maker, not a king. So, at an unknown date in the summer of
1800, he ad- dressed Napoleon again:</p>
<p>You must have long since been convinced, General, that you possess my
esteem. If you doubt my gratitude, fix your reward, and mark out the
fortune of your friends. As to my principles, I am a Frenchman, merciful
by charac- ter, and also by the dictates of reason.</p>
<p>No, the victor of Lodi, Castiglione, and Arcole, the conqueror of
Italy and Egypt, cannot prefer vain celebrity to real glory. But you are
losing precious time. We may ensure the glory of France. I say we ,
because I require the aid of Bonaparte, and he can do nothing without
me.</p>
<p>General, Europe observes you. Glory awaits you, and I am impatient to
re- store peace to my people.</p>
<p>Louis 46</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>176 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>To this, after much delay, Napoleon replied, on September 7:</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I have received your letter. I thank you for your kind remarks about
my- self. You must give up any hope of returning to France; you would
have to return over a hundred thousand dead bodies. Sacrifice your
private interests to the peace and happiness of France…. History will
not forget. 1 am not un- touched by the misfortunes of your family…. I
will gladly do what I can to render your retirement pleasant and
undisturbed. 47</p>
<p>Louis’ letter had come from his temporary r efuge in Russia; perhaps
he was there when Czar Paul I, in July, 1800, received from Napoleon a
present that almost turned the course of history. During the war of 1799
some six thousand Russians had been captured by the French. Napoleon
offered them t o England and Austria (who had been Russia’s ally) in
exchange for French prisoners; the offer was refused. 48 Since France
could make no legiti- mate use of these men, and found it expensive to
maintain them, Napoleon ordered them all to be armed, clothed in new
uniforms, and sent to the Czar without asking anything in return. 49
Paul responded with professions of friendship with France, and by
forming (December 18, 1800) the Second League of Armed Neutrality
against England. On March 23, 1801, Paul was assassinated, and the
Powers returned to the status quo ante donum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Austrian Emperor rejected the Alessandria armistice,
and sent 80,000 men under General von Bellegarde to hold the line along
the Mincio. The French replied by driving the Austrians from Tuscany,
and by attacking the Austrians in Bavaria. On December 3, 1800, Moreau’s
60,000 men fought 65,000 Austrians at Hohenlinden (near Munich), and
defeated them so decisively — taking 25,000 prisoners — that the
Austrian government, seeing Vienna at Moreau’s mercy, signed a general
armistice (December 25,</p>
<p>1800), and agreed to negotiate with the French government a separate
peace. On his return to Paris Moreau received an acclaim that may have
stirred some conflicting emotions in Napoleon, for Moreau was the
favorite candi- date of both the royalists and the Jacobins to replace
Napoleon as head of the state.</p>
<p>Plots against Bonaparte’s life continued undiscourageably. Early in
1800 a snuffbox, closely resembling the one that the First Consul
habitually used, was found on his desk at Malmaison; it contained poison
amid the snuff. 50 On September 14 and October 10 several Jacobins were
arrested, charged with conspiring to kill Napoleon. On December 24 three
Chouans, sent from Brittany by Georges Cadoudal, directed an “infernal
machine,” ioaded with explosives, against a group carrying the Consul
and his family to the opera. Twenty-two persons were killed, fifty-six
were wounded — none of Napo- leon ’s entourage. He went on to the opera
with apparent calm; but on return - ing to the Tuileries he ordered a
thorough investigation, the execution of the imprisoned Jacobins, and
the internment or deportation of 130 more who were arrested on
suspicion. Fouche, who believed that royalists, not Ja- cobins, were the
criminals, apprehended a hundred of them, and had two of these
guillotined (April 1 , 1801). Napoleon had overreacted and had over-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>ridden the law, but he felt that he was fighting a war, and that he
had to put some terror into the hearts of men who themselves scorned
law. He was in- creasingly hostile to the Jacobins and lenient with
royalists.</p>
<p>On October 20, 1800, he proposed to his aides to erase from the list
of emigres the names of those who would be allowed to return to France,
and would receive such of their confiscated goods as had not been sold
by the state or appropriated for governmental use. There were now
approximately 100,000 emigres, and many of them had asked for permission
to come back. Over the protests of worried purchasers of confiscated
property, Napoleon had 49,000 names “erased”; i.e., 49,000 of the
emigres were permitted to return. Further “erasures” we re to be made
from time to time, in the hope that this would reduce external hostility
to France, and promote the general pacification of Europe. The royalists
cheered; the Jacobins mourned.</p>
<p>The principal step in this program of peace was the meeting of the
French and Austrian negotiators at Luneville (near Nancy). Napoleon sent
not Tal- leyrand but his own brother Joseph to argue the French case
there; and Joseph accomplished his mission well. He was supported at
each step by the inexorable Consul, who expanded his demands with every
Austrian delay. Finally, seeing that the armies of France were absorbing
nearly all Italy, and were knocking at the gates of Vienna, the
Austrians yielded, and signed what they understandably called the
“terrible” Pe ace of Luneville (February 9,</p>
<p>1801). Austria recognized as French territory Belgium, Luxembourg,
and the terrain along the left bank of the Rhine from the North Sea to
Basel; she confirmed the Treaty of Campoformio; she accepted the
suzerainty of France over Italy between the Alps and Naples and between
the Adige and Nice, and the protectorate of France over the Batavian
Republic (Holland) and the Helvetic Republic (Switzerland). “Austria is
done for,” wrote the Prussian minister Haugwitz; “it n ow rests with
France alone to establish peace in Europe.” 51 The Paris Bourse rose
twenty points in a day, and Paris workers, preferring victories to
votes, celebrated with cries of 11 Vive Bona- parte /” the achievements
of Napoleon in diplomacy as wel l as war. Perhaps, however, Luneville
was war rather than diplomacy; it was the triumph of pride over
prudence, for in it lay the seeds of many wars, ending in Wa-
terloo.</p>
<p>Other negotiations brought more power. A pact with Spain (October
1,</p>
<ol start="1800" type="1">
<li><p>brought Louisiana to France. The Treaty of Florence (March
18,</p></li>
<li><p>with the King of Naples gave France the isle of Elba and the
posses- sions of Naples in central Italy, and closed Neapolitan ports to
British and Turkish trade. The old French claim to St.-Domingue — the
western sec- tion of Hispaniola — brought Napoleon into conflict with a
man who almost rivaled him in force of character. F rancois-Dominique
Toussaint — self- named L’Ouverture— had been bom a Negro slave in 1743.
At the sup- posedly cautious age of forty-eight he led the slaves of
St.-Domingue in a successful revolt, and took control first of the
French, then of the Spanish, section of the island. He governed ably,
but found it difficult to restore pro- ductive order among the liberated
Negroes, who preferred the leisurely ways</p></li>
</ol>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>hat seemed dictated by the heat. Toussaint allowed many former owners
to return to their plantations and establish a work discipline verging
on slavery. In theory he acknowledged French sovereignty over
St.-Domingue; ac- tually, however, he assumed the title of governor
general for life, with the right to name his successor — very much as
Napoleon was soon to do in France. In 1801 the First Consul sent twenty
thousand troops under General Charles Leclerc to reclaim French
authority in St.-Domingue. Toussaint fought valiantly, was overcome, and
died in jail in France (1803). In 1803 the entire island fell to the
British.</p>
<p>The British fleet, supported by the staying power of British
commerce, industry, and character, remained, through all but two years
of Napoleon’s rule, the prime obstacle to his success. Protected by the
Channel from the direct ravages of war, enriched by her unrivaled
maritime trade, her colonial acquisitions and revenues, and her priority
in the Industrial Revolution, England could afford to finance the armies
of her Continental allies in re- peated attempts to overthrow Napoleon.
The merchants and manufacturers agreed with George III, the Tories, the
emigres, and Edmund Burke that the restoration of the Bourbons to the
throne of France was the best means of recapturing the comfortable
stability of the Old Regime. Nevertheless a strong minority in England,
led by Charles James Fox, liberal Whigs, radical workingmen, and
eloquent men of letters, objected that continued war would spread
poverty and incite revolution, that Napoleon was now a fait accompli,
and that the time had come for finding a modus vivendi with that
invincible condottiere.</p>
<p>Moreover, they argued, Britain’s behavior as mistress of the seas was
mak - ing enemies for her and friends for France. British admirals
claimed that their blockade of France required that British crews should
have the right to board and search neutral vessels and confiscate goods
bound for France. Resenting this practice as an infringement of their
sovereignty, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia formed (December,
1800) the Second League of Armed Neutrality, and proposed to resist any
further British in- trusion upon their ships. As the warmth of friction
rose, the Danes seized Hamburg (which had become Britain’s chief door to
the markets of Central Europe), and the Prussians took George Ill’s
Hanover. Half the Continent, lately united against France, was now
hostile to England. As France already controlled the mouths and left
bank of the Rhine, English goods were largely kept from the markets of
France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Den- mark, the Baltic States, and
Russia. Italy was closing its ports to British trade; Spain was
clamoring for Gibraltar, Napoleon was building an army and fleet for the
invasion of England.</p>
<p>England fought back, and profited from some turns of fort une’s
wheel. A British fleet destroyed a Danish fleet in the harbor of
Copenhagen (April 2, 1801). Czar Paul I was succeeded, and his French
policy revoked, by Alexander I, who denounced Napoleon’s invasion of
Egypt, recognized the British capture of Malta from France, and signed a
treaty with England (June 17, 1801); the Second League of Armed
Neutrality faded away.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>l 19</p>
<p>Nevertheless economic setbacks in Britain, the swelling French army
at Bou- logne, and the collapse of Austria despite costly subsidies,
inclined England to thoughts of peace. On October i, 1801, her
negotiators signed a prelimi- nary agreement which pledged France to
yield Egypt to Turkey, and Britain to turn over Malta, within three
months, to the Knights of St. John; France, Holland, and Spain were to
recover most of the colonies that had been taken from them; France would
remove all her troops from central and southern Italy. After seven weeks
of further debate Great Britain and France signed the long-awaited Peace
of Amiens (March 27, 1802). When Napo- leon’s representative reached
London with the ratified documents, a happy crowd harnessed his horses
and drew the carriage to the Foreign Office amid shouts of 11 Vi ve la
Republique jrangaise! Vive Napoleon !” 52</p>
<p>The French people were stirred with gratitude to the young man —
still only thirty-two — who had so brilliantly brought ten years of war
to an end. All Europe had acknowledged his ability as a general; now it
saw that same clear mind and steady will shine in diplomacy too. And
Amiens was but a beginning; on May 23, 1802, he signed a treaty with
Prussia; on the next day, with Bavaria; on October 9, with Turkey; on
October 1 1, with Russia. When November 9 approached — anniversary of
the 18th Brumaire — he ar- ranged that it should be celebrated as a
Festival of Peace. On that day he proclaimed happily the goal of his
labors: “Faithful to its aspirat ions and its promise, the government
has not yielded to lust for hazardous and extraordi- nary enterprises.
Its duty was to restore tranquillity to humanity, and, by means of
strong and lasting ties, to draw together that great European fam- ily
whose mission it is to mold the destinies of the world.” 63 Perhaps this
was the finest moment in his history.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>REMAKING FRANCE: 1802-03</li>
</ol>
<p>“At Amiens,” said Napoleon at St. Helena, “I believed in all good
faith that my own fate, and that of France, were settled. I was going to
devote myself entirely to the administration of the country; and I
believe that I should have done wonders.” 54 This sounds like an attempt
to remove the stains of a dozen campaigns; but the day after the Peace
of Amiens was signed, Girolamo Lucchesini, Prussian ambassador at Paris,
reported to his King that Napoleon was resolved “to turn to the benefit
of agriculture, in - dustry, commerce, and the arts all those pecuniary
resources which war at once absorbs and besmirches.” Napoleon,
Lucchesini continued, talked with ardor about “canals to be completed
and opened, roads to be made or re - paired, harbors to be dredged,
towns to be embellished, places of worship and religious establishments
to be endowed, public instruction… to be pro- vided for.” 55 Actually a
great deal of progress was made along these lines be - fore war again
seized priority over construction (May 16, 1803). Taxes were reasonable,
were collected with a minimum of chicanery and cruelty, and were poured
out in government contracts that helped to keep industry</p>
<p>l8o THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>flourishing and labor employed. Commerce expanded rapidly after
England lifted the blockade. Religion rejoiced over Napoleon’s Concordat
with the Papacy; the Institute began to establish a nationwide system of
education; the law was codified and enforced; administration reached an
excellence that verged on honesty.</p>
<p>Paris again, as under Louis XIV, became the tourist capital of
Europe. Hundreds of Englishmen, forgetting the riotous cartoons that had
lam- pooned Napoleon in the British press, braved rough roads and the
rough Channel to get a glimpse of the miniature colossus who had defied
and paci- fied the established Powers. Several members of Parliament
were introduced to him; not least — in August, 1802 — the past and
future Prime Minister, Charles James Fox, who had long labored for peace
between the English and the French. Foreigners were astonished at the
prosperity that had come so quickly after Napoleon’s rise to rule. The
Due de Broglie described the years 1800- 03 as “the best and noblest
pages in the annals of France.” 56</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Code Napoleon: 1801-04</li>
</ol>
<p>“My real glory,” Napoleon reminisced, “is not the forty battles I
won— for my defeat at Waterloo will destroy the memory of those
victories… What nothing will destroy, what will live forever, is my
Civil Code.” 57 “For - ever” is an unphilosophical word; but the Code
was his greatest achievement.</p>
<p>The inexhaustible ingenuity of deviltry periodically compels a
society to improve and reformulate its ways of protecting itself from
violence, rob- bery, and deceit. Justinian had tried this in a.d. 528;
but the Corpus Iuris Civilis drawn up by his jurists was a coordinated
collection of existing laws rather than a new structure of law for a
changing and uprooted society. The problem was multiplied for France by
the legal individuality of its provinces, so that a law in one region
could not be assumed to hold sway in the next. Merlin of Douai and
Cambaceres had presented the outlines of a new and unified code to the
Convention in 1795, but the Revolution had no time to do this work;
faced with a bewildering chaos, it added to it with a thousand hasty
decrees, which it left for some lucid interval to mold into
consistency.</p>
<p>Napoleon’s peace settlements with Austria and Britain gave him this
op - portunity, however brief. On August 12, 1800, the three Consuls had
com- missioned Frangois Tronchet, Jean Portalis, Felix Bigot de
Preameneu and Jacques de Maleville to draw up a fresh plan for a
concordant national code of civil law. The preliminary draft which they
offered on January 1, 1801, was sent by Bonaparte to the leaders of the
law courts for their criticisms and comments; these were submitted to
Napoleon three months later, and were then reviewed by the legislative
committee of the Council of State, led by Portalis and Antoine
Thibaudeau. Having run all these gauntlets, the Code was taken up, title
by title, by the whole Council through eighty- seven sittings.</p>
<p>Napoleon presided at thirty-five of these. He disclaimed any
knowledge</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>of law, but he profited from the acumen and legal learning of his
fellow Consul Cambaceres. He joined in the discussions with a modesty
that en- deared him to the Council, and that would have surprised his
later years. They were inspired by his ardor and determination, and
readily accorded with his prolongation of their sessions from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. They were not enthusiastic when he convened them again in the
evening. Once, at such a nocturnal meeting, some members drowsed with
fatigue. Napoleon called them to consciousness with an amiable behest:
“Come, gentlemen, we have not yet earned our stipends.” 58 In the
judgment of Vandal the Code could never have been completed had it not
been for Napoleon’s persistent urging and friendly encouragement. 59</p>
<p>The labors of the jurists and the Council were almost aborted when
the Code was subjected to debate in the Tribunate. This assembly, still
warm with the Revolution, condemned the Code as a betrayal of that
explosion — as a return to the tyrannical rule of the husband over his
wife and of the father over his children, and as the enthronement of the
bourgeoisie over the French economy. These charges were largely
justified. The Code accepted and applied the basic principles of the
Revolution: freedom of speech, wor- ship, and enterprise, and equality
of all before the law; the right of all to public trial by jury; the end
of feudal dues and ecclesiastical tithes; and the validity of purchases
made, from the state, of confiscated church or seigno- rial property.
But — following Roman law — the Code accepted the family as the unit and
bastion of moral discipline and social order, and gave it a basis in
power by reviving the patria potestas of ancient regimes: the father was
awarded full control over his wife’s property, and full authority over
his children until they came of age; he could have them imprisoned on
his word alone; he could prevent the marriage of a son under twenty-six
or a daugh- ter under twenty-one. The Code violated the principle of
equality before the law by ruling that in disputes about wages the word
of the employer, other things equal, should be taken as against that of
the employee. The Revolution’s ban on workingmen’s associations (except
fo r purely social pur- poses) was renewed on April 12, 1803; and after
December 1 of that year every laborer was required to carry a workbook
recording his past career. The Code — Napoleon agreeing — restored
slavery in the French colonies. 60</p>
<p>The Code represented the usual historical reaction from a permissive
so- ciety toward tightened authority and control in the family and the
state. The leading authors of the legislation were men of years, alarmed
by the excesses of the Revolution — its reckless rejection of tradition,
its easing of divorce, its loosening of family bonds, its allowance of
moral laxity and political riot among women, its communal encouragement
of proletarian dictatorships, its connivance at September Massacres and
Tribunal terrors; they were re- solved to halt what seemed to them the
disruption of society and govern- ment; and in these matters Napoleon,
anxious for a steady France under his hand, gave these feelings his
resolute support. The Council of State agreed with him that there should
be a limit and early cloture on public debate over</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>he 2,281 articles of the Civil Code; the Tribunate and the
Legislature fell in line; and on March 2 1, 1804, the Code — officially
the Code Civil des Fran- §ais, popularly the Code Napoleon — became the
law of France.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Concordat of 1801</li>
</ol>
<p>Even so, the young Lycurgus was not satisfied. He knew from his own
intense nature how little the soul of man is prone to law; he had seen
in Italy and Egypt how close man remains, in his desires, to his animal
and hunting past, violent and free; it was one of the marvels of history
that these living explosives had been kept from shattering the social
frame. Was it the policemen who had tamed them? It could not be, for
policemen were few and far between, and a potential anarchist was hidden
in every second citi- zen. What, then, had restrained them?</p>
<p>Napoleon, himself a skeptic, concluded that social order rested
ultimately on the human animal’s natural and carefully cultivated fear
of supernatural powers. He came to look upon the Catholic Church as the
most effective instrument ever devised for the control of men and women,
for their grum- bling or silent habituation to economic, social, and
sexual inequality, and for their public obedience to divine commandments
uncongenial to human flesh. If there could not be a policeman at every
corner, there could be gods, all the more awesome because unseen, and
multipliable at will and need into mystic beings, hortatory or minatory,
ranged through grades of divinity and power from the desert anchorite to
the ultimate commander, preserver and destroyer of stars and men. What a
sublime conception! — what an incom- parable organization for its
dissemination and operation! — what a priceless support for teachers,
husbands, parents, hierarchs, and kings! Napoleon con- cluded that the
chaos and violence of the Revolution had been due, above all, to its
repudiation of the Church. He resolved to restore the association of
Church and state as soon as he could take the fangs out of horrified
Jaco- bins and mortified philosophers.</p>
<p>Religion in the France of 1 800 was in a confused flux not unrelated
to the moral chaos left by the Revolution. A large minority of the
people in the provinces — probably a majority in Paris — had become
indifferent to the ap- peals of priests. 61 Thousands of Frenchmen, from
peasants to millionaires, had bought from the state the property
confiscated from the Church; these pur- chasers were excommunicated, and
looked with no friendly eye upon those who denounced them as receivers
of stolen goods. There were then eight thousand active priests in
France; two thousand of these were constitu- tionels , who had sworn
fealty to the confiscatory Constitution of 1791; the other six thousand
were nonjurors who rejected the Revolution, and labored devoutly to
annul it; and they were making progress. The nonemigrant nobles, and
many of the bourgeoisie, were working to have religion restored as a
bulwark to property and social order; many of these — some of them
scions of the Revolution — were sending their children to schools
managed or</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>aught by priests and nuns who (they believed) knew better than
ungowned laic teachers how to make respectful sons and modest daughters.
62 Religion was becoming fashionable in “society” and literature ; soon
(1802) Chateau- briand’s massive eulogy, Le Genie du christianisnie ,
was to become the talk of the time.</p>
<p>Seeking every aid to his rootless rule, Napoleon decided to win the
spir- itual and structural support of the Catholic Church. Such a move
would at last quiet the rebellious Vendee, please the provinces, add six
thousand priests to his spiritual gendarmerie; it would enlist the moral
and spiritual influence of the Pope; it would take from Louis XVIII a
major argument for a Bour- bon restoration; and it would reduce the
hostility — to France and Napoleon —of Catholic Belgium, Bavaria,
Austria, Italy, and Spain. “So, as soon as I had power, I… reestablished
religion. I made it the groundwork and foun- dation upon which I built.
I considered it as the support of sound principles and good morality.”
63</p>
<p>This apertura a destra was resisted by the agnostics in Paris and the
cardi- nals in Rome. Many ecclesiastics were reluctant to sanction any
agreement that would tolerate divorce, or would abandon the claims of
the French Church to its confiscated property. Many Jacobins protested
that to recog- nize Catholicism as the national religion, protected and
paid by the govern- ment, would be to surrender what they considered one
of the major achieve- ments of the late Revolution — the separation of
state and Church. Napoleon frightened the cardinals by implying that if
they rejected his proposals he might take a leaf from Henry VIII of
England and completely divorce the French Church from Rome. He tried to
quiet the skeptics by explaining that he would make the Church an
instrument of the government in maintaining internal peace; but they
feared that his proposal would become another step in the retreat from
revolution to monarchy. He never forgave Lalande (the astronomer) “for
having wished” (Bourrienne reports) “to include him in a dictionary of
atheists precisely at the moment when he was opening negoti- ations with
the court of Rome.” 64</p>
<p>These began at Paris November 6, 1800, and continued through eight
months of maneuvering. The cardinals were experienced diplomats, but Na-
poleon had learned of the Pope’s eagerness for an agreement, and held
out for every condition favorable to his own power over the reconciled
Church. Pius VII made one concession after another because the plan
offered to end a decade of disaster for the Church in France; it would
let him depose many bishops who had flouted the papal authority; it
would enable him, with the help of French intervention, to get rid of
the Neapolitan troops that had occupied his capital; and it would
restore to the Papacy the “Legations” (Ferrara, Bologna, and Ravenna —
usually ruled by papal legates) which had been ceded to France in 1797.
— Finally, after a session that lasted till 2 a.m., the representatives
of the Roman Church and the French state signed (July 16, 1801) the
Concordat that was to govern their relations for a cen- tury. Napoleon
ratified it in September, Pius VII in December. Napoleon,</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>however, signed with the proviso that he might later make some
“regulations providing against the more serious inconveniences that
might arise from a literal execution of the Concordat.” 65</p>
<p>The historic document pledged the French government to recognize —
and finance — Catholicism as the religion of the Consuls and the
majority of the French people, but it did not make Catholicism the state
religion, and it affirmed full freedom of worship for all the French,
including Protestants and Jews. The Church withdrew its claims to
confiscated ecclesiastical prop- erty, but the state agreed in
recompense to pay the bishops an annual salary of fifteen thousand
francs, and to pay lesser stipends to parish priests. The bishops, as
under Louis XIV, were to be nominated by the government, and they were
to swear fealty to the state; but they were not to function until
approved by the pope. All “constitutional” bishops were to resign their
sees; all orthodox bishops were restored, and the churches were
officially (as they had been in fact) opened to orthodox worship. After
much debate Na- poleon yielded a precious point to the Church — the
right to accept bequests.</p>
<p>To appease the more amiable of his skeptical critics, Napoleon
unilaterally added to the Concordat 12 1 “Articles Organiques,” to
protect the preemi - nence of the state over the Church in France. No
papal bull, brief, or legate, no decree of a general council or national
synod, was to enter France with- out explicit permission from the
government. Civil marriage was to be a legal prerequisite to a religious
marriage. All students for the Catholic priest- hood were to be taught
Bossuet’s “Gallican Articles” of 1682, which</p>
<p>affirmed the legal independence of the French Catholic Church from
“ultra - montane” (over -the-mountains) rule.</p>
<p>So modified, the Concordat was presented to the Council of State, the
Tribunate, and the Legislature on April 8, 1802. Not yet in terror of
Napo- leon, they openly and vigorously opposed it as a betrayal of the
Enlighten- ment and the Revolution (it was essentially consistent with
the Constitution of 1791 ). In the Tribunate the philosophe Count Volney
engaged in spirited debate with the First Consul on the Concordat; and
the Legislature elected to its presidency Charles-Francois Dupuis,
author of a strongly anticlerical treatise, UOrigine de tons les cultes
( 1 794). Napoleon withdrew the Con- cordat from discussion by the
assemblies, and bided his time.</p>
<p>At the next nomination of members to the Tribunate and the
Legislature many of the critics failed of reappointment by the Senate.
Meanwhile Napo- leon spread among the public the story and contents of
the Concordat; as he had expected, the people cried out for its
ratification. On March 25, 1802, Napoleon rose to overwhelming
popularity by signing peace with England. So fortified, he again
submitted the Concordat to the assemblies. The Trib- unate passed it
with only seven dissentient votes; the Legislature voted 228 for it, 2 1
against. On April 1 8 it became law; and on Easter Sunday, in a solemn
ceremony in Notre-Dame, both the Peace of Amiens and the Con- cordat
were proclaimed amid the groans of the revolutionists, the laughter of
the military, and the joy of the people. A caricature ran the rounds of
the barracks showing Napoleon drowning in a font of holy water; and

<p>Napoleon consoled himself with the conviction that he had expressed
the will of the great majority of Frenchmen, and that he had
strengthened his power at the base, though he had weakened it at the
top. He had restored the clergy, but since he appointed the bishops, and
salaried them and some three thousand priests, he calculated that he
could hold them with an eco- nomic leash; the Church, he thought, would
be one of his instruments, sing- ing his glory and supporting his
policies. A little later he saw to it that a new catechism should tea ch
French children that “to honor the Emperor is to honor God Himself,” and
that “if they should fail in their duties to the Emperor… they would be
resisting the order established by God,… and would make themselves
deserving of eternal damnati on.” 60 He expressed his gratitude to the
clergy by attending Mass dutifully, but as briefly as possible.</p>
<p>He had, in these victorious moments, the conviction that he had won
the whole Catholic world to his side. Actually the French clergy, never
forget- ting the loss of their lands, and resenting their salaried
bondage to the state, looked more and more to the Pope for support
against the ruler whom they secretly considered to be an infidel.
“Gallican” by law, they became ultra - montane in feeling; when the
Emperor dispossessed Pius VII of lands that the Papacy had held for a
thousand years — still more when the Pope was evicted from Rome and
imprisoned in Savona and Fontainebleau — the clergy and the populace of
France rose in defense of their Pontiff and their creed; and Napoleon
found, too late, that the power of the myth and the word was greater
than the might of the law and the sword.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE PATHS OF GLORY</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid his projects and triumphs he had always to guard against
challenges to his power and his life. The royalists in France were
relatively quiet, for they hoped to persuade Napoleon that his safest
course was to restore the Bourbons and accept some sinecure in return.
They encouraged writers like Mme. de Genlis, whose historical romance
Mademoiselle de La Valliere painted a pleasant picture of France under
Louis XIV. They played on the secret royalism of Napoleon’s secretary
Bourrienne, and through him they sought to win Josephine. The
pleasure-loving Creole had had a surfeit of political excitement; she
feared that Napoleon, unless he changed his course, would seek
monarchical power, and would divorce her to marry a woman more likely to
give him an heir. Napoleon tried to quiet her fears with some amorous
moments, and forbade her to meddle in politics.</p>
<p>He thought that the chief threat to his power lay not from royalists
or Jacobins, but from the jealousy of the generals who led the Army on
which his power ultimately had to rest. Moreau, Pichegru, Bernadotte,
Murat, Mas- sena, had given open expression to their discontent. At a
dinner hosted by Moreau some officers denounced Napoleon as a usurper;
General Delmas</p>
<p>1 86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>called him “a criminal and a monster.” Moreau, Massena, and
Bernadotte</p>
<p>It is against the background of this military plotting that we must
inter- pret the antimilitaristic speech of Napoleon before the Council
of State on May 4, 1802:</p>
<p>In all countries force yields to civil qualities: the bayonet is
lowered before the priest,… and before the man who becomes master by his
knowledge…. Never will military government take hold in France unless
the nation has been brutalized by fifty years of ignorance…. If we
abstract from other relation- ships, we perceive that the military man
knows no other law than force, re- duces everything to force, sees
nothing else…. The civil man, on the con- trary, sees only the general
good. The character of the military man is to will everything
despotically; that of the civil man is to submit everything to dis-
cussion, reason, and truth; these are often deceptive, but meanwhile
they bring light…. I do not hesitate to conclude that eminence belongs
incontestably to the civil…. The soldiers are the children of the
citizens, and the [true] army is the nation. 70</p>
<p>Irked by a sense of insecurity, and always reaching for power,
Napoleon suggested to his intimates that his plans for the further
improvement and embellishment of France would require a longer tenure
than the decade al- ready granted him. On August 4, 1802, the Senate
announced a new “Con - stitution of the Year X” (1801); this enlarged
the Senate from forty to eighty members — all the new members to be
named by the First Consul; and it made him consul for life. When his
admirers proposed that he be given also the authority to choose his
successor, he demurred with exceptional modesty; “hereditary
succession,” he said, “is irreconcilable with the princi - ple of the
sovereignty of the people, and impossible in France.” 71 But when the
Senate, after debating the proposal, approved it by a vote of twenty-
seven to seven, the misguided seven covered their error by making the
de- cision unanimous; and Napoleon graciously accepted the honor on
condition that the public approve. On August 17 all adult males who were
registered as French citizens were asked to vote on two questions:
Should Napoleon Bonaparte be made consul for life? Should he be allowed
to choose ms suc- cessor? The reply was 3,508,885 yes, 8,374 no. 72
Presumably, as in other plebiscites, the government had means of
encouraging an affirmative reply. The sentiment of the propertied
classes was revealed when the Bourse re- acted to the vote: the value
index of traded shares, which had been seven on the day before
Napoleon’s coming to power, now rapidly rose to fifty -two. 73</p>
<p>So fortified, he made some changes in his entourage. He chose a small
group of men to be his Privy Council, through which, as his authority
be-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>l8 7</p>
<p>came indisputable, he could issue decrees in addition to the senatus
consulta which were open to his use. He reduced the Tribunate from one
hundred members to fifty, and required that its debates henceforth be
secret. He dis- missed the clever but incalculable Fouche as minister of
police, and merged that ministry into a Department of Justice under
Claude Regnier. Having discovered that Bourrienne was using his position
to make a fortune, he dis- missed him (October 20, 1802), and relied
henceforth on the devoted service of Claude Meneval. Thereafter
Bourrienne’s Memoirs became unreliably hostile to Napoleon, and
Meneval’s Memoirs were unreliably favorable; however, taken in their
algebraic sum, they still constitute the most intimate account of the
miniature colossus who was to bestride Europe for the next ten
years.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the Plebiscite of 1802, added to the diverse triumphs
at Marengo and Amiens, that ruined, in Napoleon, the moderation and per-
spective without which genius skirts the edge of madness. For each of
the steps that raised him to vertiginous powers he found persuasive or
forceful arguments. When the leaders of the Cisalpine Republic, centered
in Milan, asked his help in drawing up a constitution, he offered one in
which three electoral colleges — manned respectively by landowners,
businessmen, and the professions — would choose a commission empowered
to appoint the mem- bers of a legislature, a senate, and a council of
state; these would choose a president. Meeting at Lyons in January,
1802, the delegates ratified this constitution, and invited Napoleon —
whom they considered to be an Italian stranded in France — to be the
first president of the new state. He came from Paris to address them —
in Italian — and on January 26, by acclamation, the First Consul of
France became the head of the Republica Italiana. All Eu- rope wondered
what would come next out of this new stupor mundi, this hypnotic marvel
of the world. 74</p>
<p>The alarm grew when he annexed Piedmont to France. That “Foot of the
Mountain” had been occupied by th e French in 1798; it lay beyond the
“natural boundaries” that Napoleon had promised to protect; however, if
restored to the King of Sardinia, it might become a hostile barrier
between France and her Italian protectorates in Liguria and Lombardy. On
Septem- ber 4, 1 802, Napoleon declared Piedmont a part of France.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, where he had found so many avenues to Italy, he could
not proceed so confidently; those sturdy cantons, where men through cen-
turies had counted liberty more precious than life, would have made any
enemy pay heavily for conquest. However, they had for the most part wel-
comed the ideals of 1789, and in 1798 they had formed the Helvetic Re-
public under the protection of France. This met strong opposition from
the owners of large estates, who, using peasants as soldiers,
established a separate government at Bern, and challenged the pro-French
Republic centered at Lausanne. Both parties sent agents to Napoleon to
seek his sup- port; he refused to receive the Bernese agent, who then
appealed to England; England sent money and arms to the oligarchs.
Napoleon sent troops to the</p>
<p>i88</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Republicans (November, 1802); so aided, these suppressed the Bernese
re- volt. Napoleon pacified both parties with an Act of Mediation
(February 19,</p>
<ol start="1803" type="1">
<li>which established the Swiss Confederation as nineteen indepen- dent
cantons, each with its own constitution, all under the protectorate of
France, all obligated to send a quota of troops to the French Army.
Despite this clause, the Act of Mediation, by English testimony,
“received approval from many quarters, and was undoubtedly popular among
the cantons.” 75</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless the English government looked upon these successive
moves — in Lombardy, Piedmont, and Switzerland — as dangerous expansions
of French influence, seriously disturbing that balance of Continental
Powers which had become the keystone of British policy in Europe.
Further resent- ment was aroused by the publication, in the Moniteur for
January 30, 1803, of the official report submitted to the French
government by Comte Horace Sebastiani, whom Napoleon had sent to examine
the defenses of Cairo, Jaffa, Jerusalem, and Acre; the Count estimated
that “6,000 men would suffice… to conquer Egypt.” 76 The document
aroused suspicion, in Eng - land, that Napoleon was contemplating
another expedition to Egypt. The British government felt that it could
no longer think of evacuating Malta and Alexandria; these now seemed
indispensable to the defense of British power in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Still another expansion of Napoleon’s influence agitated the British.
The Treaty of Luneville stipulated that the German rulers of
principalities west of the Rhine, who had lost 4,375 square miles of
taxable territory by the recognition of French sovereignty over that
area, should be compensated with principalities east of the stream.
Twenty German nobles sent repre- sentatives to Paris to urge their
claims; Prussia and Russia joined in the hunt; Talleyrand collected
another fortune in pourboires. Finally the distribution was made, mostly
by “secularizing” city -states that had been governed by Catholic
bishops for centuries. Napoleon’s aim in this process had been to
promote a Confederation of the Rhine as a buffer state between France
and Austria-Prussia. Austria protested that the reshuffling of statelets
would prove to be another step in the dissolution of the Holy Roman
Empire. It did.</p>
<p>Ang ered by the widening grasp of Napoleon’s arms, the ruling classes
in England asked themselves might not war be less costly than such
peace. The manufacturers protested that French control of the Rhine made
France the arbiter of British trade with the most lucrative of European
markets. Mer- chants complained that while the Peace of Amiens ended the
British block- ade of France, the French were laying prohibitive import
dues on British products competitive with French industry. 77 The
aristocracy denounced the peace as a disgraceful surrender to the French
Revolution. Nearly all parties agreed that Malta must be held. Meanwhile
the British press reviled Napoleon in stories, editorials, and cartoons;
he protested to the British gov- ernment, which told him that the
British press was free; he bade the French press to retaliate in kind.
78</p>
<p>Communications between the governments became increasingly
bellicose.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>Lord Whitworth, British ambassador, brusquely informed Napoleon that
Britain would not leave Malta until the French government had given a
satis- factory explanation of the expansionist moves it had made since
the Peace of Amiens. On March 13, 1803, amid a large gathering of French
and foreign dignitaries, Napoleon, confronting Whitworth as if for
battle, charged the British with violating the peace treaty and arming
for war; Whitworth, furious at such a transgression of diplomatic rules,
thereafter preferred to deal with Talleyrand, who knew how to dress
facts with courtesy. On April 25 Whitworth was instructed by his
government to present an ulti- matum: France must agree to English
retention of Malta for at least ten years; she must withdraw from
Holland, Switzerland, and Italy, and must recompense the King of
Sardinia for the loss of Piedmont in the recent war. Napoleon ridiculed
the proposals; Whitworth asked for, and received, his passport, and both
sides prepared for war.</p>
<p>Realizing that England, controlling the seas, could at will take any
French colony, Napoleon sold the territory of Louisiana to the United
States for eighty million francs (May 3, 1803). England, still
technically at peace, in- structed its naval force to capture any French
vessel they might encounter. War was officially declared on May 16,
1803, and continued for twelve years.</p>
<p>From that bitter moment Napoleon the administrator receded in
history, and Napoleon the general, aged thirty-four, turned his soul to
war. He ordered the arrest of all Britons still found on French soil. He
bade General Mortier take Hanover at once, before it could be turned
into a military base by the Hanoverian George III. What infuriated him
was the thought that throughout a decade of conflict England had
financed Continental armies against France, had blockaded French ports
and seized French shipping and French colonies, and that through all
these military activities she herself had remained immune from attack.
So now he resigned himself to what in calmer moments he had rejected as
an impracticable dream: he would try to cross that damnable ditch and
make those merchants and bankers feel the touch of war upon their soil
and flesh.</p>
<p>He ordered his generals to assemble 150,000 men and 10,000 horses
along the coast at Boulogne, Dunkirk, and Ostend; he ordered his
admirals to gather and equip, at Brest, Rochefort, and Toulon, powerful
fleets which, when ready to sail and fight, were to find their way
through a mesh of British vessels to harbors that a million workers
would have prepared for them around Boulogne; and in those harbors men
were to build hundreds of trans- port ships of all kinds. He himself
repeatedly left Paris to tour the camps and docks, to mark the progress
of the enterprise, and to inspire the soldiers, sailors, and laborers
with an active presence that would seem to them a pledge of purpose and
victory.</p>
<p>In the Channel, British men-of-war kept watch; and along the English
coast — at Dover, Deal, and elsewhere — a hundred thousand patriots kept
watch, night and day, resolved to resist to the death any attempt to
invade their inviolable shores.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>V. THE GREAT CONSPIRACY: 1803-04</p>
<p>On the night of August 21, 1803, an English frigate, commanded by
Cap- tain Wright, brought across the Channel from England eight
Frenchmen under the lead of Georges Cadoudal, a fervent leader of the
irreconcilable Chouans. They landed on a rocky cliff near Biville in
Normandy, where natives in league with them drew them up by ropes. On
December 10 Cap- tain Wright brought from England to Biville a second
group of conspirators, including the emigre noble Armand de Polignac. On
a third crossing, Janu- ary 16, 1804, the captain brought Jules de
Polignac, and the French emigre generals Pichegru and Lajolais.
Pichegru, after well-led victories with the Revolutionary armies, had
plotted to restore the Bourbons, had been de- tected, and had escaped to
England (1801). All three groups made their way to Paris, where they
were concealed in the homes of royalists. Cadoudal later confessed that
he had planned to kidnap Napoleon, and, if Napoleon re- sisted, to kill
him. 79 We may believe that “Cadoudal was furnished by the British
Government with drafts for a million francs to enable him to orga- nize
the insurrection in the capital”; 80 but there is no evidence that the
Brit - ish government consented to assassination.</p>
<p>The plotters delayed action in the expectation that the Comte d’
Artois, younger brother of Louis XVI, would join them in Paris, 81 ready
to replace Napoleon; but he did not come. Meanwhile (January 28, 1804)
Pichegru visited General Moreau and asked his cooperation; Moreau
refused to join in any attempt to restore the Bourbons, but offered
himself as ruler of France if Napoleon should be removed. 82 About this
time Bernadotte gave Juliette Recamier the names of twenty generals who,
he declared, were devoted to him and were eager to restore “the true
Republic.” 83 “I may fairly say,” Napoleon recalled at St. Helena, “that
during the months from September,</p>
<p>On January 26 a Chouan named Querelle, who had been arrested three
months before and was soon to be executed, revealed the details of the
con- spiracy in return for the commutation of his sentence. Guided by
his con- fession, the slow-moving police of Claude Regnier found and
arrested Moreau on February 15, Pichegru on February 26, the Polignac
brothers on February 27, and Cadoudal on March 29. Cadoudal proudly
admitted that he had planned to remove Napoleon from power, and that he
had expected a French prince to meet him in Paris; but he refused to
name any of his as- sociates in the plot. 85</p>
<p>Meanwhile an English agent named Drake had been collecting another
group of conspirators in or near Munich, with a plan to raise an
insurrec- tion against Napoleon in the newly French regions on the west
bank of the Rhine. If we may believe Meneval, “an order of the [British]
King’s Privy Council enjoined on the French exiles to betake themselves
to the banks of the Rhine, under penalty of forfeiting their pensions;
and a regulation fixed</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>I 9 I</p>
<p>he amount of pay allotted to each officer, and each soldier.” 86 When
Napo - leon’s spies notified him of these developments he concluded tha
t the Bour- bon prince whom the London conspirators had awaited was
among these emigres. The Comte d’ Artois could not be located among
them; but in the little town of Ettenheim, some six miles east of the
Rhine in the electorate of Baden, Napoleon’s agents discovered— living
in apparent quiet except for occasional but suspicious visits to
Strasbourg 87 — Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon- Conde, Due d’Enghien,
son of the Due de Bourbon, and grandson of the Prince de Conde.</p>
<p>When this was reported to Napoleon he concluded that the thirty-two-
year-old Duke was a leader of the conspiracy to depose him. The
revelations of Querelle, and the arrests recently made in Paris, had
thrown the once intrepid general into a state of excitement — perhaps of
fear and wrath — that hurried him into decisions that he would always
defend but (despite his protestations 88 ) perhaps secretly regretted.
He sent instructions to General Ordener to lead an armed force to
Ettenheim, arrest the Duke, and bring him to Paris. The Duke was taken
on the night of March 14-15, 1804, and on March 18 he was imprisoned in
the Fortress of Vincennes, five miles east of Paris.</p>
<p>On March 20 Napoleon ordered a military court of five colonels and
one major to go to Vincennes and try the Duke on charges of having,
while in the pay of England, taken up arms against his own country.
About the same time he sent General Savary, head of his special police,
to watch over the prisoner and the trial. Engnien admitted that he had
received money from English authorities, and that he had hoped to lead a
force into Alsace. 89 The court pronounced him guilty of treason, and
condemned him to death. He asked permission to see Napoleon; the court
refused this, but proposed to send a message to Napoleon, recommending
mercy. Savary overruled this proposal, and ordered the sentence of death
to be carried out. 90</p>
<p>Meanwhile Napoleon and his immediate circle, at Josephine’s
Malmaison, debated the fate of the Duke. They assumed that he would be
found guilty — but should he be pardoned as an olive branch to the
royalists? Talleyrand, who in 1814 was to chaperone the restoration of
the Bourbons, advised exe- cution as a quick way of ending the hopes and
plots of the royalists; remem- bering his record in the Revolution, he
feared for his property, perhaps his life, should the Bourbons return to
power; he “wished,” wrote Barras, “to put a river of blood between
Napoleon and the Bourbons.” 91 Cambaceres, coolest and most legal of the
consular trio, favored delay. Josephine fell at Napoleon’s feet and
pleaded for Enghien’s life, and her entreaties were sec - onded by her
daughter Hortense and Napoleon’s sister Caroline.</p>
<p>At some time that night, from Malmaison, Napoleon sent Hugues Maret
to Paris with a message to Councilor of State Pierre Real, bidding him
to go to Vincennes, personally examine the Duke, and report the results
to Mal- maison. Real received the message, but, exhausted by the day’s
labor, fell asleep in his room, and did not reach Vincennes till 5 a.m.,
March 21. Engnien had died before a firing squad at 3 a.m. in the prison
yard. Savary,</p>
<p>I 9 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>apparently thinking that he had served his master well, rode to
Malmaison to give Napoleon the news. Napoleon retired to his private
apartment, locked himself in, and refused all appeals from his wife to
let her enter.</p>
<p>Bitter denunciation came from royalists and royalty. They were
appalled at the idea of a commoner killing a Bourbon. The cabinets of
Russia and Sweden sent protests to the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at
Ratisbon, and proposed that the invasion of Baden by the armed forces of
France be made the subject of an international inquiry. The Diet made no
answer, and the Elector of Baden refused to offend France. Czar
Alexander I instructed his ambassador in Paris to demand an explanation
of the execution; Talley- rand replied with an argu mentwm ad hominem:
“If, when England was plan - ning the assassination of Paul I, the
authors of the plot had been known to be lurking at a stone’s throw from
the frontier, would they not have been seized with all possible speed?”
92 William Pitt was muc h comforted by the news of the execution;
“Bonaparte,” he said, “has now done himself more mischief than we have
done him since the last declaration of war.” 93</p>
<p>The reaction in France itself was milder than many had expected. Cha-
teaubriand resigned a minor appointment in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs; but when the head of that ministry, the imperturbable
Talleyrand, gave a ball on March 24 — three days after the death of
Enghien — twenty members of the old French nobility, and representatives
of all the European courts, attended. 94 Three months after the affair
it had apparently disappeared from the public mind. Fouche, however,
usually a keen observer, remarked of the execution, “C’est plus qu’un
crime, c’est une faute” (It is more than a crim e, it is a blunder).
95</p>
<p>Napoleon may have felt some remorse, but he never admitted it. “These
people,” he said, “wanted to throw France into confusion, and to destroy
the Revolution by destroying me; it was my duty both to defend and to
avenge the Revolution…. The Due d’Enghien was a conspirator like any
other, and he had to be treated as such…. I had to choose between con-
tinuous persecution and one decisive blow, and my decision was not
doubt- ful. I have forever silenced bo th royalists and Jacobins.” 96 He
would let them know that he was “not to be trifled with,” 97 that
neither was his “blood ditch- water.” 98 He thought, with some reason,
that he had put the fear of death into the hearts of royalist plotters,
who could now see that Bourbon blood would not save them. Actually,
there were no further royalist plots to take Napoleon’s life.</p>
<p>In the case of the conspirators who had been arrested in Paris he
con- ducted himself with more caution and publicity. The trials were to
be open, and the press was allowed to report them in detail. Though
Bourrienne had opposed the execution of Enghien, Napoleon asked him to
attend the trials and to give him an account of the proceedings.
Pichegru did not wait to be tried; on April 4 he was found dead in his
cell, strangled by his own cravat. In other cases the guilt was admitted
or evident; but of Moreau no more was proved than that he had been
openly hostile to Napoleon, and had concealed from the authorities his
knowledge that Pichegru and others were</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE CONSULATE</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>proposing to unseat him by force. On June 10, 1804, the court
pronounced sentence: nineteen conspirators were condemned to death,
Moreau to two years’ imprisonment. Cadoudal died impenitent on June 28.
Of the remain - ing eighteen Napoleon pardoned twelve, including the two
Polignacs. Moreau asked if his sentence might be changed to exile;
Napoleon agreed, though he predicted that Moreau would continue to plot
against him.“ Moreau took ship to America, stayed there till 1812,
returned to take service with the Russian Army, fought against Napoleon
at Dresden (August 29,</p>
<p>1813), died of his wounds (September 2), and was buried in
Russia.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE ROAD TO EMPIRE: 1804</li>
</ol>
<p>Brooding over the conspiracy, Napoleon wondered why he had to do his
work under constant threat of assassination, while the rulers who were
re- peatedly leagued against France — George III of England, Francis II
of Aus- tria and the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick William III of
Prussia, and Alexander I of Russia — could expect to maintain their
supremacy till their normal death, and could rely on the orderly
transference of their sover- eignty to their natural or designated
heirs. It could not be because they had submitted their policies and
appointments to democratic controls; they had not. Apparently the secret
of their security lay in their “legitimacy”— the sanction of heritable
rule by a public opinion formed to habit through gen- erations and
centuries.</p>
<p>Privately — ever less privately — Napoleon dreamed of absolute,
consecrated, transmissible authority, even of a dynasty that might
acquire the seal and aura of time. He felt that the tasks he longed to
accomplish required the stability and continuity of absolute rule.
Consider Caesar — how he had brought Roman laws and civilization to
Gaul, had driven the Germans be- yond the Rhine, and had won the title
of imperator, the commander in chief; well, had not he, Napoleon, done
these? What might Caesar have ac- complished had he been spared
assassination? Think of how much Augustus achieved in his forty-one
years of imperial power, freed from the plebeian chaos that Caesar had
ended, and supported by a Senate wise enough to subordinate palaver to
genius. Napoleon, the son of Italy, the admirer of the ancient Romans,
longed for such untrammeled continuity, and for the privi- lege, enjoyed
by the second-century emperors, of choosing and training a
successor.</p>
<p>But he also thought, and often spoke, of Charlemagne, who, in a reign
of forty-six years (768-814), had brought order and prosperity to Gaul,
had spread the laws of the Franks, as a civilizing force, into Germany
and Italy, and had won — or commanded — consecration by a Pope; had not
he, Napo- leon, done all these things? Had he not restored in France the
religion that was checking the pagan riot let loose by the Revolution?
Did he not, like Charlemagne, deserve the crown for life?</p>
<p>Augustus and Charlemagne, those great restorers, had no faith in
democ-</p>
<p>!94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>racy; they could not subject their trained and considered judgments,
their far-reaching plans and policies, to carping criticism and
inconclusive debate by the corruptible delegates of popular simplicity.
Caesar and Augustus had known Roman democracy in the vote-buying days of
Milo and Clodius; they could not have governed at the behest of mindless
mobs. Napoleon had seen Parisian democracy in 1792; he felt that he
could not decide and act at the behest of impassioned crowds. It was
time to call the Revolution closed, to consolidate its basic gains, and
end the chaos and anxiety and class war.</p>
<p>Now, after chastening the royalists with an execution, he was ready
to accept their basic claim — that France was not prepared, emotionally
or men- tally, for self-government; and that some form of authoritarian
rule was indispensab le. In 1804, according to Mme. de Remusat, “certain
persons, somewhat closely connected with politics, were beginning to
assert that France felt the necessity of absolute right in the governing
power. Political courtiers, and sincere supporters of the Revolution,
seeing that the tran- quillity of the country depended upon one life,
were discussing the insta- bility of the Consulate. By degrees the
thoughts of all were once more turned to monarchy.” 100 Napoleon agreed
with them. “The French,” he remarked to Mme. de Remusat, “love monarchy
and all its trappings.” 101</p>
<p>So, to begin with, he gave them the trappings. He ordered official
cos- tumes for the Consuls, the ministers, and the other personnel of
the govern- ment; velvet was made prominent in these garments, partly to
encourage its Lyons manufacturers. Napoleon gathered to his personal
service four gen- erals, eight aides-de-camp, four prefects, and two
secretaries (Meneval had begged for assistance). The consular court took
on a complexity of etiquette and protocol rivaling that of established
royalty. Comte Auguste de Remusat was put in charge of this ritual,
while his wife Claire headed the four ladies who attended Josephine.
Liveried servants and ornate carriages added to the ordained complexity
of official life. Napoleon observed all these forms in public, but soon
took refuge in the simplicity of his private ways. However, he smiled
consent upon court festivities, fancy-dress or masked balls, and formal
visits to the opera, where his wife might display gowns reminiscent of
another extravagant queen, lately pitifully dead. Paris indulged him, as
he indulged Josephine; after all, might not some flourishes and frippery
be allowed to this young ruler, who was adding the statesmanship of
Augustus to the victories of Caesar? It seemed so natural that imperator
should be- come empereur.</p>
<p>Strange to say, many groups in France heard without resentment the
rumors of an impending crown. Some 1,200,000 Frenchmen had bought, from
the state, property confiscated from the Church or from emigres; they
saw no security for their title deeds except in preventing a return of
the Bourbons; and they saw in the permanence of Napoleon’s power the
best protection against such a calamity. The peasants reasoned likewise.
The proletariat was divided; it was still fond of the Revolution as
having been so largely its work, but with a fondness fading as it
enjoyed the steady employ- ment and good wages that the Consulate had
brought; and it was not im-</p>

<p>mune to the rising cult of glory, or to the glamour of an empire that
might surpass in splendor any of those that contended with France. The
bour- geoisie was suspicious of emperors, but this would-be emperor had
been faithfully and effectively their man. The lawyers, brought up on
Roman law, were almost all in favor of transforming France into an
imperium that would resume the work of Augustus and the
philosopher-emperors from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius. Even the royalists,
if they could not have a pedi- greed Bourbon, would think it a step
forward if monarchy should be re- stored in France. The clergy, though
they knew that Napoleon’s piety was political, were grateful for the
restoration of the Church. Almost all classes, outside of Paris,
believed that only a stable monarchical government could control the
individualistic passions and class divisions that rumbled under the
crust of civilization.</p>
<p>But there were negative voices. Paris, which had made the Revolution
and had suffered for it in body and soul, could not without some audible
or secret regrets lay it to rest with all its more or less democratic
constitutions. The surviving Jacobin leaders saw in the contemplated
change an end to their role in the guidance of France; and perhaps to
their lives. The men who had voted for the execution of Louis XVI knew
that Napoleon despised them as regicides; they had to rely on Fouche to
protect them, but Fouche could be dismissed again. The generals who had
hoped to divide and share Napoleon’s power cursed the movement that was
preparing to clothe in royal purple that “whippersnapper” from Corsica.
102 The philosophers and the savants of the Institute mourned that one
of its members was planning to drown democracy in an imperial
plebiscite.</p>
<p>Even in the nearly royal family there was a division of sentiment.
Jose- phine was fearfully opposed to any move toward empire. Napoleon,
made emperor, would even more powerfully itch for an heir, and therefore
for a divorce, since he could expect none from her; so her whole
dazzling world of dresses and diamonds could fall in ruins at any
moment. Napoleon’s brothers and sisters had long since urged him to get
divorced; they hated the Creole as a wanton seducer, an obstacle to
their own dreams of power; now they supported the drive toward empire as
a step toward displacing Jose- phine. Brother Joseph formulated the
argument that</p>
<p>he conspiracy of Cadoudal and Moreau decided the declaration of an
heredi- tary title. With Napoleon as consul for a period, a coup-de-main
might over- throw him; as consul for life the blow of a murderer would
have been re- quired. He assumed hereditary rank as a shield; it would
thus no longer suffice to kill him; the whole state would have to be
overthrown. The truth is that the nature of things tended toward the
hereditary principle; it was a matter of necessity. 103</p>
<p>Councilors, senators, tribunes, and others in the government moved to
complaisance with Napoleon’s wishes, and for simple reasons: consent
would merely lessen their freedom of debate — which was already
vestigial; opposition might cost them their political lives; early
complaisance might earn a rich reward. On May 2, 1804, the legislative
bodies passed a triple</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>motion: “1. That Napoleon Bonaparte… shall be appointed Emperor of
the French Republic; 2. That the tide of Emperor, and the Imperial
power, shall be hereditary in his family…. 3. That care shall be taken
to safeguard Equality, Liberty, and the rights of the people in their
entirety.” On May 18 the Senate proclaimed Napoleon emperor. On May 22
the registered voters of France, by ballots individually signed,
approved this fait accompli by 3,572,329 yeas to 2,569 nays. Georges
Cadoudal, hearing the news in his prison cell, remarked, “We came her e
to give France a king; we have given her an emperor.” 104</p>
