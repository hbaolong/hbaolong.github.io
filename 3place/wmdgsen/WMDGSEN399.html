<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>The Renaissance Captures Rome</p>
<p>1447-92</p>
<p>I. THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD</p>
<p>W HEN Pope Nicholas V mounted the oldest throne in the world,*</p>
<p>Rome was hardly a tenth of the Rome that had been enclosed by</p>
<p>the walls of Aurelian (a.d. 270-5), and was smaller in area and
population (80,000)* than Venice, Florence, or Milan. Since the ruin of
the major aqueducts by the barbarian invasions, the seven hills had been
without a reliable water supply; some minor aqueducts remained, some
springs, many cisterns and wells; but a large proportion of the
inhabitants drank the water of the Tiber. 2 Most of the people lived in
the unhealthy plains, subject to inundation from the river and to
malarial infection from the neighboring swamps. The Capitoline hill was
now called Monte Caprino, from the goats ( capri ) that nibbled its
slopes. The Palatine hill was a rural retreat, almost uninhabited; the
ancient palaces from which it derived its name were dusty quarries. The
Borgo Vaticano, or Vatican Town, was a small suburb across the river
from the central city, and huddled about the decaying shrine of
St. Peter. Some churches, like Santa Maria Maggiore or Santa Cecilia,
were beautiful within but plain without; and no church in Rome could
compare with the duomo of Florence or Milan, no monastery could rival
the Certosa di Pavia, no town hall rose to the dignity of the Palazzo
Vecchio, or the Castello Sforzesco, or the Palace of the Doges, or even
the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena. Nearly all the streets were muddy or
dusty alleys; some were paved with cobblestones; only a few were lit at
night; they were swept only on extraordinary occasions like a jubilee,
or the formal entry of some very important person.</p>
<p>The economic support of the city came partly from pasturage and the
production of wool, and the cattle that grazed in the environing fields,
but chiefly from the revenues of the Church. There was little
agriculture, and only petty trade; industry and commerce had well-nigh
disappeared through lack of protection from brigand raids. There was
almost no mid-</p>

dynasty in 660 b. c.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>374</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>die class — only nobles, ecclesiastics, and commoners. The nobles,
who owned nearly all the land that had not fallen to the Church,
exploited their peasantry without Christian compunction or hindrance.
They suppressed revolt, and waged their feuds, with bravi — strong-arm
ruffians kept in their employ and trained to beat or kill. The great
families — above all the Co- lonna and the Orsini — seized tombs, baths,
theaters, and other structures in or near Rome and turned them into
private fortresses; and their rural castles were designed for war. The
nobles were usual hostile to the popes, or strove to name and govern
them. Time and again they created such dis- order that the popes fled;
Pius II prayed that any other city might be his capital. 8 When Sixtus
IV and Alexander VI warred against such men it was in a forgivable
effort to win some security for the Papal See.</p>
<p>Normally the ecclesiastics ruled Rome, for they had the Church’s
varied revenue to spend. The inhabitants were dependent upon that influx
of gold from a dozen countries, upon the employment it enabled churchmen
to provide, and upon the charity that it allowed the popes to dispense.
The people of Rome could not be enthusiastic about any reform of the
Church that would lessen that golden flow. Precluded from rebellion,
they sub- stituted for it a sharpness of satire unequaled elsewhere in
Europe. A statue in the Piazza Navona, probably a Hellenistic Hercules,
was/ renamed Pas- quino — perhaps from a nearby tailor — and became the
bulletin board of the latest squibs, usually in the form of Latin or
Italian epigrams, and often against the reigning pope. The Romans were
religious, at least on occasion; they crowded to receive the papal
blessing, and were proud to imitate am- bassadors by kissing the papal
feet; but when Sixtus IV, suffering from gout, failed to appear for a
scheduled benediction they cursed him with Roman virulence. Moreover,
since Eugenius IV had abrogated the Roman Republic, the popes were the
secular rulers of Rome, and received the con- tumely usually awarded to
governments. It was the misfortune of the papacy to be seated amid the
most lawless population in Italy.</p>
<p>The popes felt themselves thoroughly justified in claiming a degree
and area of temporal power. As the heads of an international
organization they could not afford to be the captives of any one state,
as they had been in effect in Avignon; so trammeled, they could hardly
serve all peoples im- partially, much less realize their majestic dream
of being the spiritual gov- ernors of every government. Though the
“Donation of Constantine” was a palpable forgery (as Nicholas admitted
by hiring Valla), the donation of central Italy to the papacy by Pepin
(755), confirmed by Charlemagne (773), was an historical fact. The popes
had coined their own money at</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 375</p>
<p>least as far back as 782 / and for centuries no one had questioned
their right. The unification of local powers, feudal or martial, in a
central government was taking place in the Papal States as in the other
nations of Europe. If the popes from Nicholas V to Clement VII ruled
their states as absolute monarchs they were following the fashion of the
times; and they could with reason complain when reformers like
Chancellor Gerson of the Uni- versity of Paris proposed democracy in the
Church but deprecated it in the state. Neither state nor Church was
ready for democracy at a time when printing had not yet begun or spread.
Nicholas V became pope seven years before Gutenberg printed his Bible,
thirty years before printing reached Rome, forty-eight years before the
first publication of Aldus Manutius. Democracy is a luxury of
disseminated intelligence, security, and peace.</p>
<p>The secular rule of the popes directly applied to what antiquity
had</p>
<p>called Latium (now Lazio), a small province lying between
Tuscany,</p>
<p>Umbria, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Beyond this
they claimed also Umbria, the Marches, and the Romagna (the ancient Ro-
mania) . These four regions together made a broad belt across central
Italy from sea to sea; they contained some twenty-six cities, which the
popes, when they could, ruled by vicars, or divided among provincial
governors. Furthermore, Sicily and the whole Kingdom of Naples were
claimed as papal fiefs on the basis of an agreement between Pope
Innocent III and Frederick II; and the payment of an annual feudal fee
by these states to the papacy became a major source of quarrels between
the Regno and the popes. Finally the Countess Matilda had bequeathed to
the popes (1107), as her feudal domain, practically all of Tuscany,
including Florence, Lucca, Pistoia, Pisa, Siena, and Arezzo; over all
these the popes claimed the rights of a feudal sovereign, but were
rarely able to give effect to their claim. Harassed by internal
corruption, military and fiscal incompetence, and the confusion of
European with Italian politics, and of ecclesiastical with secular
affairs, the papacy struggled through centuries to preserve its tra-
ditional territories from internal usurpation by condottieri, and from
ex- ternal encroachment by other Italian states; so Milan repeatedly
tried to appropriate Bologna, Venice seized Ravenna and sought to absorb
Ferrara, and Naples stretched tentative tentacles into Latium. To meet
these attacks the popes seldom depended on their little army of
mercenaries, but played the covetous states one against another in a
balance-of-power policy, striv- ing to keep any one of them from growing
strong enough to swallow papal terrain. Machiavelli and Guicciardini
rightly traced the disunion of Italy in part to this policy of the
popes; and the popes rightly pursued it as their</p>
<p>37&lt;S THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>only means of sustaining their political and spiritual independence
through their temporal power.</p>
<p>As political rulers the popes felt compelled to adopt the same
methods as their secular compeers. They distributed — sometimes they
sold — offices or benefices to influential persons, even to minors, to
pay political debts, or to advance political purposes, or to reward or
support men of letters or artists. They arranged marriages for their
relatives into politically poweful fami- lies. They used armies like
Julius II, or the diplomacy of deceit like Leo X. 5 They put up with —
sometimes profited from — a degree of bureaucratic ve- nality probably
no greater than that which prevailed in most governments of the time.
The laws of the Papal States were as severe as those of others; thieves
and counterfeiters were hanged by papal vicars as a more or less bitter
necessity of government. Most of the popes lived as simply as the
supposedly requisite display of official ceremony would permit; the
worst tales we read of them were legends set afloat by irresponsible
satirists like Berni, or disappointed place hunters like Aretino, or the
Roman agents — e.g., Infessura — of powers in violent or diplomatic
conflict with the papacy. As for the cardinals who administered the
ecclesiastical and political affairs of the Church, they thought of
themselves as senators of a wealthy state, and lived accordingly; many
of them built palaces, many patronized letters or arts, some indulged
themselves with mistresses; they genially accepted the easy moral code
of their reckless time.</p>
<p>As a spiritual power the Renaissance popes faced the problem of
recon- ciling humanism with Christianity. Humanism was half pagan, and
the Church had once set herself to destroy paganism root and branch,
creed and art. She had encouraged or countenanced the demolition of
pagan temples and statuary; the cathedral of Orvieto, for example, had
only re- cently been built with marbles taken partly from Carrara,
partly from Roman ruins; a papal legate had sold marble blocks from the
Colosseum to be burned for lime; 6 as late as 1461 the Palazzo Venezia
had been begun with further spoliation of that Flavian Amphitheater;
Nicholas himself, in his architectural enthusiasm, used twenty-five
hundred cart- loads of marble and travertine from the Colosseum, the
Circus Maximus, and other ancient structures to rebuild the churches and
palaces of Rome. 7 To reverse that attitude, to preserve and collect and
cherish the remaining art and classics of Rome and Greece, required a
revolution in ecclesiastical thought. The prestige of humanism was
already so high, the impetus of the neopagan movement was so strong, her
own leaders were so deeply</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME</p>
<p>tinged with it, that the Church had to find place for these
developments in the Christian life, or risk losing the intellectual
classes of Italy, perhaps later of Europe. Under Nicholas V she opened
her arms to humanism, placed herself bravely and generously on the side,
at the head, of the new literature and art. And for an exhilarating
century (1447-1534) she gave to the mind of Italy such ample freedom —
incredibilis libertas, said Filelfo 8 — and to the art of Italy such
discriminating patronage, opportunity, and stimulus that Rome became the
center of the Renaissance, and enjoyed one of the most brilliant epochs
in the history of mankind.</p>

<li>Nicholas v: 1447-55</li>
</ol>
<p>Raised in poverty at Sarzana, Tommaso Parentucelli somehow found
means to attend the University of Bologna for six years. When his funds
ran out he went to Florence and served as tutor in the homes of Rinaldo
degli Albizzi and Palla de’ Strozzi. His purse replenished, he returned
to Bo - logna, continued his studies, and received at twenty-two the
doctorate in theology. Niccolo degli Albergati, Archbishop of Bologna,
made him controller of the archiepiscopal household, and took him to
Florence to attend Eugenius IV in the Pope’s long exile there. In these
Flor entine years the priest became a humanist without ceasing to be a
Christian. He de- veloped a warm friendship with Bruni, Marsuppini,
Manetti, Aurispa, and Poggio, and joined their literary gatherings; soon
Thomas of Sarzana, as the humanists called him, was aflame with their
passion for classical an- tiquity. He spent almost all his income on
books, borrowed money to buy costly manuscripts, and expressed the hope
that some day his funds would suffice to gather into one library all the
great books in the world; in that ambition the Vatican Library had its
origin.® Cosimo engaged him to cata- logue the Marcian Library, and
Tommaso was happy among the manu- scripts. He could hardly know that he
was preparing himself to be the first Renaissance pope.</p>
<p>For twenty years he served Albergati in Florence and Bologna. When
the Archbishop died (1443) Eugenius appointed Parentucelli to succeed
him; and three years later the Pope, impressed by his learning, his
piety, and his administrative ability, made him a cardinal. Another year
passed; Eu- genius passed away; and the cardinals, deadlocked between
the Orsini and Colonna factions, raised Parentucelli to the papacy. “Who
would have thought,” he exclaimed to Vespasiano da Bisticci, “that a
poor bell rin ger of</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>a priest would be made pope, to the confusion of the proud?” 10 The
hu - manists of Italy rejoiced, and one of them, Francesco Barbaro,
proclaimed that Plato’s vision had come true: a philosopher had becom e
king.</p>
<p>Nicholas V, as he now called himself, had three aims: to be a good
pope, to rebuild Rome, and to restore classical literature, learning,
and art. He conducted his high office with modesty and competence, gave
audience at almost any hour of the day, and managed to get along
amicably with both Germany and France. The Antipope Felix V, realizing
that Nicholas would soon win all Latin Christendom to his allegiance,
resigned his pretensions and was gracefully forgiven; the rebellious but
disintegrating Council of Basel moved to Lausanne and dissolved (1449);
the conciliar movement was ended, the Papal Schism was healed. Demands
for reform of the Church still came from beyond the Alps; Nicholas felt
incapable of achiev- ing that reform in the face of all the
office-holders who would lose by it; instead he hoped that the Church
would regain, as the leader in the revival of learning, the prestige
that she had lost at Avignon and in the Schism. Not that his support of
scholarship was motivated by political ends; it was a sincere, almost an
amorous passion. He had made arduous trips over the Alps in search of
manuscripts; it was he who had unearthed at Basel the works of
Tertullian.</p>
<p>Now, dowered with the revenues of the papacy, he sent agents to
Athens, Constantinople, and divers cities in Germany and England to seek
and buy or copy Greek or Latin manuscripts, pagan or Christian; he
installed a large corps of copyists and editors in the Vatican; he
called almost every promi- nent humanist in Italy to Rome. “All the
scholars in the world,” wrote Vespasiano in fond exaggeration, “came to
Rome in the time of Pope Nicholas, partly of their own accord, partly at
his request.” 11 He re - warded their work with the liberality of a
caliph thrilled by music or poetry. The subdued Lorenzo Valla received
500 ducats (2,500?) for putting Thucydides into Latin dress; Guarino da
Verona received 1500 ducats for translating Strabo; Niccolo Perotti 500
for Polybius; Poggio was put to translating Diodorus Siculus; Theodoras
Gaza was lured from</p>
<p>Ferrara to make a new translation of Aristotle; Filelfo was offered a
house in Rome, an estate in the country, and 10,000 ducats to render
into Latin the Iliad and the Odyssey; the Pope’s death, however, preven
ted the execu- tion of this Homeric enterprise. These rewards were so
great that some scholars — mirabile dictu — hesitated to accept them;
the Pope overcame their scruples by playfully warning them: “Don’t
refuse; you may not find an - other Nicholas.” 12 When an epidemic drove
him from Rome to Fabriano</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 379</p>
<p>he took his translators and copyists with him, lest any of them
should succumb to the plague. 13 Meanwhile he did not neglect what might
be called the Christian classics. He offered five thousand ducats to
anyone who would bring him the Gospel of St. Matthew in the original
tongue. He engaged Gianozzo Manetti and George of Trebizond to translate
Cyril, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa, and other
patrological litera- ture; he commissioned Manetti and aides to make a
new version of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek; this, too,
was frustrated by his death. These Latin translations were hurried and
imperfect, but they for the first time opened Herodotus, Thucydides,
Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Ap- pian, Philo, and Theophrastus to
students who could not read Greek. Re- ferring to these translations,
Filelfo wrote: “Greece has not perished, but has migrated to Italy —
which in fo rmer days was called Greater Greece.” 14 Manetti, with
greater gratitude than accuracy, calculated that more Greek authors were
translated during the eight years of Nicholas’ pontificate than</p>
<p>Nicholas loved the appearance and form as well as the contents of
books; himself a calligraphist, he had his translations written
carefully upon parch- ment by expert scribes; the leaves were bound in
crimson velvet, secured by silver clasps. As the number of his books
mounted — finally to 824 Latin and 352 Greek manuscripts — and these
were added to previous papal collec- tions, the problem arose of housing
the five thousand volumes — the largest store of books in Christendom —
in such a way that their complete transmis- sion to posterity might be
assured. The construction of a Vatican Library was one of Nicholas’
dearest dreams.</p>
<p>He was a builder as well as a scholar, and from the outset of his
pontifi- cate he had resolved to make Rome worthy of leading the world.
A jubilee year was at hand in 1450; a hundred thousand visitors were
expected; they must not find Rome a shabby ruin; the prestige of the
Church and the papacy required that the citadel of Christianity should
confront pilgrims with “noble edifices combining taste and beauty with
noble proportions,” which “would immensely donduce to the exaltation of
the chair of St. Peter”; so Nicholas, on his deathbed, apologetically
explained his aim. He restored the walls and gates of the city, repaired
the Acqua Vergine aque- duct, and had an artist construct an ornamental
fountain at its mouth. He engaged Leon Battista Alberti to design
palaces, public squares, and spacious avenues shielded from sun and rain
by arcaded porticoes. He had many streets paved, many bridges renewed,
the Castle of Sant’ Angelo repaired. He lent money to prominent citizens
to help them build palaces that would</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>be an ornament to Rome. At his bidding Bernardo Rossellino renovated
Santa Maria Maggiore, San Giovanni Laterano, San Paolo and San Lorenzo
fuori le mura — outside the walls — and the forty churches that Gregory
I had designated as stations of the cross. 19 He made majestic plans for
a new Vatican Palace that, with its gardens, would cover all the Vatican
hill, and would house the pope and his staff, the cardinals, and the
administrative offices of the Curia; he lived to complete his own
chambers (later occupied by Alexander VI and called the Appartamento
Borgia), the library (now the Pinacoteca Vaticana), and the rooms or
stanze later decorated by Raphael. He brought Benedetto Bonfigli from
Perugia, and Andrea del Castagno from Florence, to paint frescoes — now
lost — on the Vatican walls; and he persuaded the aging Fra Angelico to
return to Rome and paint in the Pope’s own chapel the stories of
St. Stephen and St. Laurence. He planned to tear down the old and
crumbling basilica of St. Peter, and raise over the Apostle’s tomb the
most imposing church in the world; it was left</p>
<p>All this, he hoped, could be financed from the proceeds of the
jubilee. Nicholas announced this as a celebration of the restored peace
and unity of the Church, and the sentiment went well with the peoples of
Europe. The migration of pilgrims from every quarter of Latin
Christendom was of unprecedented magnitude; eyewitnesses compared it to
the movement of myriads of ants. The crowding in Rome was so extreme
that the Pope limited to five, then three, then two days the maximum
length of any visi- tor’s stay. On one occasion two hundred persons were
killed in a crush that swept many into the Tiber; Nicholas thereafter
tore down houses to widen the approaches to St. Peter’s. As the pilgrims
brought rich offer ings, the financial returns from the jubilee exceeded
even the Pope’s expecta - tions, and covered the expense of his new
buildings and his outlay for scholars and manuscripts. 17 The other
cities of Italy suffered a shortage of money because — a Perugian
complained — “it all flowed into Rome”; but in Rome the innkeepers,
moneychangers, and tradesmen profited hugely, and Nicholas was able to
deposit 100,000 florins (,500,000?) in the bank of the Medici alone. 18
The countries beyond the Alps rumbled with dis- content at the efflux of
gold into Italy.</p>
<p>Even in Rome some disaffection troubled the new prosperity. Nicholas’
government of the city was enlightened and just from his point of view,
and he had made a concession to republican hopes by nominating four
citizens who were to appoint all municipal officials and control all
taxes levied in the city. But the senators and nobles whose class had
ruled Rome</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 381</p>
<p>during the Avignon papacy and the Schism fretted under the papal
govern- ment, and the populace resented the transformation of the
Vatican into a palace fortress secure against such assaults as had
driven Eugenius from Rome. The republican ideas preached by Arnold of
Brescia and Cola di Rienzo still agitated many minds. In the year of
Nicholas’ accession a leading burgher, Stefano Porcaro, made a fiery
speech demanding the res- toration of self-government. Nicholas sent him
into comfortable exile as podesta of Anagni, but Porcaro found his way
back to the capital, and raised the cry of liberty before an excited
carnival crowd. Nicholas ban- ished him to Bologna, but left him full
freedom except for the necessity of daily showing himself to the papal
legate there. Nevertheless the undis- courageable Stefano managed, from
Bologna, to organize a complicated plot among three hundred of his
followers in Rome. On the feast of the Epiphany, while the Pope and the
cardinals were at Mass in St. Peter’s, an attack was to be made on the
Vatican, its treasury was to be seized to provide funds for establishing
a republic, and Nicholas himself was to be taken prisoner. 19 Porcaro
secretly left Bologna (December 26, 1452), and joined the conspirators
on the eve of the planned attack. But his absence from Bologna was
noted, and a courier brought warning to the Vatican. Stefano was traced,
found, and imprisoned, and on January 9 he was beheaded in Sant’ Angelo.
The republicans denounced the execution as murder, the humanists
condemned the plot as monstrous infidelity to a benevolent pope.</p>
<p>Nicholas was shaken and changed by the discovery that a large section
of the citizenry looked upon him as a despot, however benevolent. Har-
rowed with suspicion, embittered by resentment, tortured by gout, he
aged rapidly. When news came to him that the Turks had entered
Constanti- nople over the corpses of 50,000 Christians, and had turned
St. Sophia into a mosque (1453), all the glory of his pontificate seemed
a fitful vanity. He appealed to the European powers to join in a crusade
to recapture the fallen citadel of Eastern Christianity; he called for a
tenth of all the revenue of Western Europe to finance the effort, and
pledged a tenth of papal, Curial, and other ecclesiastical revenues; and
all war between Christian nations was to cease on pain of
excommunication. Europe hardly listened. People com- plained that money
raised by previous popes for crusades had been used for other purposes;
Venice preferred a commercial entente with the Turks; Milan took
advantage of Venetian difficulties by retaking Brescia; Florence looked
with satisfaction on Venice’s loss of Eastern trade. 20 Nicholas bowed
to reality, and the lust of life cooled in his veins. Worn out with</p>

<p>futile diplomacy, and punished for the sins of his predecessors, he
died in 1455, at the age of fifty-eight.</p>
<p>He had restored peace within the Church, he had restored order and
splendor to Rome, he had founded the greatest of libraries, he had
recon- ciled the Church and the Renaissance. He had kept his hands free
from war, had avoided nepotism, had struggled to turn Italy from
suicidal strife. Amid unprecedented revenues he himself had led a simple
life, loving the Church and his books, and extravagant only in his
gifts. A grieving chroni- cler expressed the feeling of Italy when he
described the scholar Pope as “wise, just, benevolent, gracious,
peaceable, affectionate, charitable, humble . . . endowed with every
virtue.” 21 It was the verdict of love, and Porcaro might have demurred;
but we may let it stand.</p>
<p>hi. calixtus ra: 1455-8</p>
<p>The disunion of Italy determined the papal election that followed:
the factions, unable to agree on an Italian, chose a Spanish cardinal,
Alfonso Borgia, who took the name of Calixtus III. He was already
seventy-seven; he could be depended upon to die soon, and allow the
cardinals another and perhaps more profitable choice. A specialist in
canon law and diplomacy, he had a legalistic mind, and cared little for
the classical scholarship that had enamored Nicholas. The humanists, who
had no indigenous root in Rome, languished during his pontificate,
except that Valla, now quite reformed, was still a papal secretary.</p>
<p>Calixtus was a good man, who loved his relatives. Ten months after
his coronation he raised to the cardinalate two of his nephews — Luis
Juan de Mila and Rodrigo Borgia — and Don Jayme of Portugal,
respectively twenty- five, twenty-four, and twenty-three years of age.
Rodrigo (the future Alexander VI) had the additional handicap of being
carelessly candid about his mistresses; however, Calixtus gave him
(1457) the most lucrative post at the papal court — that of
vice-chancellor; in the same year he made him also commander in chief of
the papal troops. So began, or grew, the nepo- tism by which pope after
pope gave church offices to his nephews or other relatives, who were
sometimes his sons. To the anger of the Italians, Calix- tus surrounded
himself with men of his own country; Rome was now ruled by Catalans. The
Pope had reasons: he was a foreigner in Rome; the nobles and republicans
were plotting against him; he wished to have near him men whom he knew,
and who would protect him from intrigue while he at- tended to his prime
interest — a crusade. Moreover, the Pope was resolved</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 383</p>
<p>to have friends in a College of Cardinals perpetually struggling to
make the papacy a constitutional as well as an elective monarchy,
subject in all its decisions to the cardinals as a senate or privy
council. The popes opposed and overcame this movement precisely as the
kings fought and defeated the nobles. In each case absolute monarchy
won; but perhaps the replacement of a local with a national economy, and
the growth of international relations in scope and complexity, required,
for the time, a centralization of leader- ship and authority. 21 *</p>
<p>Calixtus wore out his last energies in a vain attempt to stir Europe
to resist the Turks. When he died Rome celebrated the end of its rule by
“barbarians.” When Cardinal Piccolomini was named his successor Rome
rejoiced as it had not rejoiced over any pope during the last two
hundred years.</p>
<ol start="4" type="i">
<li>Pius 11: 1458-64</li>
</ol>
<p>Enea Silvio de’ Piccolomini began his career in 1405 in the town
of</p>
<p>Corsignano, near Siena, of poor parents with a noble pedigree.
The</p>
<p>University of Siena taught him law; it was not to his taste, for he
loved literature, but it gave keenness and order to his mind, and
prepared him for the tasks of administration and diplomacy. At Florence
he studied the humanities under Filelfo, and from that time he remained
a humanist. At twenty-seven he was engaged as secretary by Cardinal
Capranica, whom he accompanied to the Council of Basel. There he fell in
with a group hostile to Eugenius IV ; for many years thereafter he
defended the conciliar movement against the papal power; for a time he
served as secretary to the Antipope Felix V. Perceiving that he had
hitched his wagon to a falling star, he coaxed a bishop to introduce him
to the Emperor Frederick III. Soon he received a post in the royal
chancery, and in 1442 he accompanied Frederick to Austria. For a while
he remained moored.</p>
<p>In those formative years he seemed quite formless — merely a clever
climber who had no sturdy principles, no goal but success. He passed
from cause to cause without losing his heart, and from woman to woman
with a gay inconstancy that seemed to him — and to most of his
contemporaries — the proper training for the obligations of matrimony.
He wrote for a friend a love letter designed to melt the obstinacy of a
girl who preferred marriage to fornication. 22 Of his several
illegitimate children he sent one to his father, asking him to rear it,
and confessing that he was “neither holier than David nor wiser than
Solomon”; 23 the young devil could quote</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>384</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>Scripture to his purpose. He wrote a novel in the manner of
Boccaccio; it was translated into almost every European tongue, and
plagued him in the days of his sanctity. Though his further advancement
seemed to require taking holy orders, he shrank from the step because,
like Augustine, he doubted his capacity for continence. 24 He wrote
against the celibacy of the clergy. 25</p>
<p>Amid these infidelities he remained faithful to letters. That same
sensi- tivity to beauty which had corrupted his morals enamored him of
nature, delighted him with travel, and formed his style until he had
made himself one of the most engaging writers and eloquent orators of
the fifteenth century. He wrote, nearly always in Latin, in nearly every
species of</p>
<p>composition — fiction, poetry, epigrams, dialogues, essays,
histories, travel sketches, geography, commentaries, memoirs, a comedy;
and always with a verve and grace that rivaled Petrarch’s liveliest
prose. He could phrase a state paper, prepare or improvise an address,
with persuasive subtlety and captivating fluency; it is characteristic
of the age that Aeneas Sylvius, be- ginning almost from nothing, raised
himself to the papacy on the point of his pen. His verses had no
enduring depth or worth, but they were smooth enough to get him the
poet’s crown from the hand of the complaisant Frederick III (1442). His
essays had a lighthearted charm that glossed over their author’s lack of
conviction or principle. He could pass from a discourse on “The Miseries
of Court Life” (“as rivers flow to the sea, so vices flow to courts” 29
), to a treatise “On the Nature and Care of Horses.” It was another sign
of the times that his long letter on education — addressed to King
Ladislas of Bohemia but intended for publication — quoted, with one
exception, only pagan authors and instances, stressed the glory ol
humanistic studies, and urged the King to fit his sons for the hardships
and responsibilities of war; “serious matters are settled not by laws
but by arms.” 27 His travel notes are the best of their kind in
Renaissance litera - ture. He described with avid interest not only
cities and rural scenes, but industries, products, political conditions,
constitutions, manners, and mor- als; and not since Petrarch had any
Italian written so fondly well of the countryside. He was the only
Italian in centuries who loved Germany; he had a good word for the
boisterous burghers who filled the air with song and themselves with
beer instead of murdering one another in the streets. He called himself
varia videndi cupidus, eager to see a variety of things; 28 and one of
his frequent sayings was: “A miser is nev er satisfied with his money,
nor a wise man with his knowledge.” 29 Turning his facile plume to
history, he composed short biographies of illustrious contemporaries (

<p>viris Claris), a life of Frederick III, an account of the Hussite
wars, and an outline of universal history. He planned a larger Universal
History and Geography, continued to work on it during his pontificate,
and completed the section on Asia, which Columbus read with interest. 30
As pope he com- posed, from day to day, Commentarii or memoirs, giving
the history of his reign to his final illness. “He read and dictated
till midnight as he lay in bed,” says his contemporary Platina, “nor did
he sleep above five or six hours.” 31 He apologized for giving papal
time to literary composition: “Our time has not been taken from our
duties; we have given to writing the hours due to sleep; we have robbed
our old age of its rest that we might hand down to posterity all that we
know to be memorable.” 32</p>
<p>In 1445 the Emperor sent Aeneas Sylvius as envoy to the Pope. He, who
had a hundred times written against Eugenius, made his apologies so elo-
quently that the kindly pontiff readily forgave him; and from that day
the soul of Aeneas belonged to Eugenius. He became a priest (1446), and
at forty-one reconciled himself to chastity; henceforth he lived an
exemplary life. He kept Frederick loyal to the papacy, and by skillful —
sometimes devious — diplomacy restored the allegiance of the German
electors and prelates to the Apostolic See. His visits to Rome and Siena
reawakened his love of Italy; gradually he loosened his ties with
Frederick, and attached himself (1455) to the papal court. He had always
wanted to be back in the excitement and politics of his native land; in
Rome he would be at the very center of things; who could say but in the
tumult and shuffle of events he might not become pope? In 1449 he was
made bishop of Siena; in 1456 he became Cardinal Piccolomini.</p>
<p>When the time came to choose a successor to Calixtus, the Italians in
the conclave, to prevent the election of the French Cardinal
d’Estouteville, gave their votes to Piccolomini. The Italian cardinals
were resolved to keep the papacy and the Sacred College Italian, not
only for their personal reasons but through fear that a non-Italian pope
might again disrupt Christendom by favoring his own country or taking
the papacy from Italy. No one held against Aeneas the sins of his youth;
the merry Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia cast a decisive vote for him; the
majority felt that Cardinal Piccolomini, though so recently capped in
red, had the qualifications of a man of wide experience, a successful
diplomat well posted on troublesome Germany, and a scholar whose
learning would heighten the luster of the papacy.</p>
<p>He was now fifty-three, and his adventurous life had taken such toll
of his health that he seemed already an old man. On a voyage from
Holland</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>to Scotland (1435) he had encountered frighteningly rough seas —
taking twelve days from Sluys to Dunbar — and had vowed, if saved, to
walk bare- foot to the nearest shrine of the Virgin. This proved to be
at Whitekirk, ten miles away. He kept his vow, walked the full distance
with bare feet on snow and ice, contracted gout, and suffered severely
from it all the rest of his life. By 1458 he had stone in the kidneys,
and a chronic cough. His eyes were sunken, his face pale; at times, says
Platina, “nobody could tell that he was alive but by his voice.” 33 As
pope he lived simply and frugally; his household expenses in the Vatican
were the lowest on record. When his duties allo wed he retired to a
rural suburb, where “he entertained him - self not like a pope but as an
honest humble rustic”; 34 sometimes he held consistories, or received
ambassadors, under shady trees, or amid an olive grove, or by a cooling
spring or stream. He called himself — punning on his nam z — silvarum
amator, lover of woods.</p>
<p>As pope he took his name from Virgil’s recurrent phrase, pius Aeneas
. If we may with custom moderately mistranslate the adjective, he lived
up to it: he was pious, faithful to his duties, benevolent and
indulgent, temper- ate and mild, and won the affection of even the
cynics of Rome. He had outgrown the sensualism of his youth, and was
morally a model pope. He made no attempt to conceal his early amours, or
his propaganda for the councils against the papacy, but he issued a Bull
of Retraction (1463) humbly asking God and the Church to forgive his
errors and sins. The humanists who had expected lavish patronage from a
humanist pope were disappointed to find that while he enjoyed their
company, and gave several of them places in the Curia, he dispensed no
luscious fees but conserved the papal funds for a crusade against the
Turks. He continued, in his leisure moments, to be a humanist: he
studied the ancient ruins carefully, and for- bade their further
demolition; he amnestied the people of Arpino because Cicero had been
born there; he commissioned a new translation of Homer, and employed
Platina and Biondo in his secretariat. He brought Mino da Fiesole to
carve, and Filippino Lippi to paint, in the churches of Rome. He
indulged his vanity by building, from designs by Bernardo Rossellino, a
cathedral and Piccolomini palace in his native Corsignano, which he re-
named Pienza after himself. He had the poor noble’s pride of ancestry,
and was too loyal to his friends and relatives for the good of the
Church; the Vatican became a Piccolomini hive.</p>
<p>Two admirable scholars graced his pontificate. Flavio Biondo, a papal
secretary since Nicholas V, was a symbol of the Christian Renaissance:
he loved antiquity and spent half his life describing its history and
relics, but</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 387</p>
<p>he never ceased to be a devout, orthodox, and practising Christian.
Pius valued him as guide and friend, and profited from his company on
tours of the Roman remains; for Biondo had written an encyclopedia in
three parts — Roma instaurata, Roma triumphans, and Italia illustrata —
recording the topography, history, institutions, laws, religion,
manners, and arts of ancient Italy. Greater still was his Historiarum ab
inclinatione Romanorum, an immense Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
from 476 to 1250 — the first critical history of the Middle Ages. Biondo
was no stylist, but he was a discriminating historian; through his work
the legends that Italian cities had cherished of their Trojan or like
fancied origins died away. The un- dertaking was too ambitious even for
Biondo’s seventy -five years; it was unfinished at his death (1463); but
it set to later historians an example of conscientious scholarship.</p>
<p>John Cardinal Bessarion was a living vehicle of the Greek culture
that was entering Italy. Bom at Trebizond, he received at Constantinople
a thorough schooling in Greek poetry, oratory, and philosophy; he
continued his studies under the famous Platonist Gemistus Pletho at
Mistra. Coming to the Council of Florence as Archbishop of Nicaea, he
took a leading part in the reunion of Greek and Latin Christianity;
returning to Constantinople he and other “Uniates” were repudiated by
the lower clergy and the peo - ple. Pope Eugenius made him a cardinal
(1439), and Bessarion moved to Italy, bringing with him a rich
collection of Greek manuscripts. At Rome his house became a salon of
humanists; Poggio, Valla, and Platina were among his closest friends;
Valla called him latinorum graecissimus, graeco- rum latinissimus — the
most learned Hellenist among the Latins, the most accomplished Latinist
among the Greeks. 35 He spent nearly all his income in purchasing
manuscripts or having them copied. He himself made a new translation of
Aristotle’s Metaphysics; but as a disciple of Gemistus he favored Plato,
and led the Platonic camp in a hot controversy that raged at the time
between Platonists and Aristotelians. Plato won that campaign, and the
long rule of Aristotle over Western philosophy came to an end. When
Nicholas V appointed Bessarion legate at Bologna, to govern the Romagna
and the Marches, Bessarion acquitted himself so well that Nicho- las
called him “angel of peace.” For Pius II he undertook difficult diplo -
matic missions in a Germany again seething with revolt against the Roman
Church. Toward the end of his life he bequeathed his library to Venice,
where it now forms a precious part of the Biblioteca Marciana. In 1471
he narrowly missed election to the papacy. He died a year later, honored
throughout the world of scholarship.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>His missions to Germany failed, partly because the efforts of Pius II
to reform the Church were frustrated, and partly because a new attempt
to levy a tithe for a crusade revived transalpine antipathy to Rome. At
the outset of his pontificate Pius appointed a committee of high
prelates to formulate a program of reform. He accepted a plan submitted
by Nicholas of Cusa, and embodied it in a papal bull. But he found that
no one in Rome wanted reform; almost every second dignitary there
profited from one or another immemorial abuse; apathy and passive
resistance defeated Pius; and meanwhile his difficulties with Germany,
Bohemia, and France used up his energy, and the crusade that he planned
absorbed his devotion and cried for funds. He had to content himself
with reproving cardinals for licentious lives, and with sporadic
improvements of monastic discipline. In 1463 he addressed a final appeal
to the cardinals:</p>
<p>People say that we live for pleasure, accumulate wealth, bear
our-</p>
<p>selves arrogantly, ride on fat mules and handsome palfreys, trail the
fringes of our cloaks after us, and show round plump faces beneath</p>
<p>the red hat and the white hood, keep hounds for the chase, spend</p>
<p>much on actors and parasites, and nothing in defense of the
Faith.</p>
<p>And there is some truth in their words: many among the cardinals</p>
<p>and other officials of our court do lead this kind of life. If the
truth</p>
<p>be confessed, the luxury and pomp at our court is too great. And</p>
<p>this is why we are so detested by the people that they will not
listen to us, even when we say what is just and reasonable. What do
you</p>
<p>think is to be done in such a shameful state of things? . . . We
must</p>
<p>inquire by what means our predecessors won authority and con-</p>
<p>sideration for the Church. … We must maintain that authority by</p>
<p>the same means. Temperance, chastity, innocence, zeal for the Faith .
. . contempt of earth, the desire for martyrdom have exalted the</p>
<p>Roman Church, and made her mistress of the world . 36</p>
<p>The Pope, who as Aeneas Sylvius had been so uniformly successful as a
diplomat, had to bear one setback after another in his dealings with the
European powers. Louis XI gave him a brief triumph by revoking the
Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, but when Pius refused to aid the house of
Anjou in its plans for recapturing Naples, Louis in effect revoked his
revo- cation. Bohemia persisted in the revolt that John Huss had
started; the Reformation had begun there a century before Luther, and
the new king, George Podebrad, was giving it his powerful support. The
German</p>
<p>hierarchy continued to league with German princes in resisting
collection of the tithe, and renewed the old cry for a general council
to reform the</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 389</p>
<p>Church and sit in judgment upon the pope. Pius responded by issuing
(1460) the bull Execrabilis, which condemned and forbade any attempt re-
convene a general council without papal initiative and consent; if, he
argued, such a council could be summoned at any time by opponents of
papal policy, papal jurisdiction would be in constant jeopardy, and ec-
clesiastical discipline would be paralyzed.</p>
<p>These disputes fettered the efforts of the Pope to unify Europe
against the Turks. On the very day of his coronation he expressed his
horror at the advance of the Moslems along the Danube to Vienna, and
through the Balkans into Bosnia. Greece, Epirus, Macedonia, Serbia,
Bosnia were fall- ing to the enemies of Christianity; who could say when
they would leap across the Adriatic into Italy? A month after his
coronation Pius issued an invitation to all Christian princes to join
him in a great congress at Mantua and lay plans to rescue Eastern
Christendom from the Ottoman tide.</p>
<p>He himself arrived there on May 27, 1459. Arrayed in the most
gorgeous vestments of his office, he was borne through the city on a
litter held up by the nobles and vassals of the Church. He addressed
great throngs in one of the most moving orations of his career. But no
king or prince came from beyond the Alps, and none sent representatives
with powers to commit his state to war; nationalism, which was to
achieve the Reformation, was al- ready strong enough to make the papacy
an ineffectual suppliant before the thrones of the kings. The cardinals
urged the Pope to return to Rome; neither did they relish the thought of
yielding a tithe of their income to the crusade; some decamped to their
pleasures; some asked Pius to his face did he wish them to die of fever
in Mantua’s summer heat? The Pontiff waited patiently for the Emperor,
but Frederick III, instead of coming to the aid of the man who in the
past had served him well, declared war on Hungary in an effort to add to
his realm the very nation that was most actively preparing to resist the
Turks. France again made its co-operation conditional on papal support
of a French campaign against Naples. Venice held back for fear that her
remaining possessions in the Aegean would be the first sacrifice in a
war of Christian Europe against the Ottomans. At last, in August, an
embassy came from Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy; in September
Francesco Sforza appeared; other Italian princes followed his lead, and
on the 26th the Congress held its first sitting, four months after the
arrival of the Pope. Four months more passed in argument; finally, by
agreeing to the division of Turkish and formerly Byzantine territory in
Europe among the victorious powers, Pius won Burgundy and Italy to his
plan for a holy war. All Christian laymen were to contribute to the
cause</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>a thirtieth of their income, all Jews a twentieth, all clergy a
tenth. The Pope returned to Rome in almost complete exhaustion; but he
gave orders for the construction of a papal fleet, and prepared, despite
gout and cough and stone, to lead the crusade himself.</p>
<p>And yet his nature shrank from war, and he dreamed of a peaceful</p>
<p>victory. Perhaps encouraged by rumors that Mohammed II, born of a
Christian mother, had secret leanings toward Christianity, Pius
addressed to the Sultan (1461) an earnest appeal to accept the Gospel of
Christ. He had never been more eloquent.</p>
<p>Were you to embrace Christianity there is no prince on earth who</p>
<p>would surpass you in glory or equal you in power. We would ac-</p>
<p>knowledge you as emperor of the Greeks and the East; and what you
have now taken by violence, and retain by injustice, would then be</p>
<p>your lawful possession. . . . Oh, what a fullness of peace it would
be!</p>
<p>The golden age of Augustus, sung by the poets, would return. If</p>
<p>you were to join yourself to us the whole of the East would soon</p>
<p>turn to Christ. One will could give peace to the entire world,
and</p>
<p>that will is yours ! 37</p>
<p>Mohammed made no reply; whatever his theology, he knew that his final
protection against Western arms lay not in the promises of the Pope but
in the religious ardor of his people. Pius turned more realistically to
col- lecting the clerical tithe. A windfall sustained him in 1462 when
rich deposits of alum were found in papal soil at Tolfa in western
Latium; several thousand men were put to work mining the substance so
valued by dyers; soon the mines were yielding 100,000 florins per year
to the Holy See. Pius announced that the discovery was a miracle, a
divine contribution to the Turkish war. 38 The Papal States were now the
richest government in Italy, with Venice a close second, Naples third,
then Milan, Florence, Modena, Siena, Mantua. 39</p>
<p>Venice, perceiving the resolute earnestness of the Pope, accelerated
its preparations. The other powers held back, or offered merely token
aid; the collection of taxes for the crusade met with formidable
resistance almost everywhere. Francesco Sforza cooled to the enterprise
as promising to strengthen Venice by redeeming her lost possessions and
trade. Genoa, which had pledged eight triremes, withheld them. The Duke
of Burgundy urged the Pope to wait for a better day. But Pius announced
that he would go to Ancona, expect there the union of new papal and
Venetian fleets, cross with them to Ragusa, join Skanderbeg of Bosnia
and Matthias Cor-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 391</p>
<p>vinus of Hungary, and lead in person the advance against the Turks.
Nearly all the cardinals protested; they had no appetite for marching
through the Balkans; they warned the Pope that Bosnia was reeking with
heretics and plague. The ailing pontiff nevertheless took the cross of a
crusader, bade farewell to Rome, not expecting to see it again, and
sailed with his fleet for Ancona (June 18, 1464).</p>
<p>Meanwhile the armies that were supposed to meet him faded away as if
by Oriental magic; the troops originally promised by Milan did not come;
those which Florence sent were so poorly equipped as to be useless; when
Pius reached Ancona (July 19) he found that most of the crusaders who
had assembled there had deserted, weary of waiting and worried for food.
Plague broke out in the Venetian fleet as it left the lagoons, and
caused a delay of twelve days. Brokenhearted by the vanishing of his
armies and the nonappearance of the Venetian armada, Pius languished at
Ancona, sick to the verge of death. Finally the fleet was sighted; the
Pope sent his galleys to meet them, and had himself carried to a window
from which he could see the harbor. As the combined navies came in sight
he died (August 14,</p>
<p>1464). Venice recalled her vessels, the remaining soldiers dispersed,
the crusade collapsed. The brilliant and versatile climber who had
craved suc- cess after success had reached the throne of thrones, had
graced it with urbane scholarship and Christian benevolence, and had
drunk to the dregs the gall of failure, humiliation, and defeat; but he
had redeemed the errors of his youth with the devotion of his maturity,

death.</p>

<p>The lives o f great men oft remind us that a man’s character can
be</p>
<p>formed after his demise. If a ruler coddles the chroniclers about him
they may lift him to posthumous sanctity; if he offends them they may
broil his corpse on a spit of venom or roast him to darkest infamy in a
pot of ink. Paul II quarreled with Platina; Platina wrote the biography
upon which most estimates of Paul depend, and handed him down to
posterity as a monster of vanity, pomp, and greed.</p>
<p>There was some truth in the indictment, though not much more than
might be found in any biography untempered with charity. Pietro Barbo,
Cardinal of San Marco, was proud of his handsome appearance, as nearly
all men are. When elected pope he proposed, probably in humor, to be
called Formosus — good-looking; he allowed himself to be dissuaded,
and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>392</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>took the title of Paul II. Simple in his private life, yet knowing
the hyp- notic effect of magnificence, he kept a luxurious court, and
entertained his friends and guests with costly hospitality. On entering
the conclave that elected him he, like the other cardinals, had pledged
himself, if chosen, to wage war against the Turks, to summon a general
council, to limit the number of cardinals to twenty-four and the number
of papal relatives among them to one, to create no man a cardinal under
thirty years of age, and to consult the cardinals on all important
appointments. Paul, elected, repudiated these capitulations as
nullifying time-honored traditions and powers. He consoled the cardinals
by raising their yearly revenue to a minimum of 4000 florins (00,000?).
He himself, coming of a mercantile family, relished the security of
florins, ducats, scudi, and gems that held a fortune in a ray of light.
He wore a tiara that outweighed a palace in worth. As cardinal he had
kept the goldsmiths busy with orders for jewels, medals, and cameos;
these, and costly relics of classic art, he had collected in the
sumptuous Palazzo San Marco which he had built for himself at the foot
of the Capitol.* With all his acquisitiveness he stooped to no simony,
repressed the sale of indulgences, and governed Rome with justice if not
with mercy.</p>
<p>He is worst remembered by his quarrel with the Roman humanists. Some
of these were secretaries to the pope or the cardinals; most of them
filled less dignified positions as abbreviatores — writers of briefs, or
keepers of records, for the Curia. Whether as a measure of economy, or
to rid the Collegium Abbreviatorum of the fifty-eight Sienese whom Pius
II had appointed to it, Paul disbanded the whole group, gave its work to
other departments, and left some seventy humanists jobless or reduced to
less lucrative posts. The most eloquent of these dismissed humanists was
Bar- tolommeo de’ Sacchi, who took the Latin name Platina from his
native Piadena near Cremona. He appealed to the Pope to re-employ the
dismissed men; when Paul refused he wrote him a threatening letter. Paul
had him arrested, and kept him for four months in Sant’ Angelo, bound
with heavy chains. Cardinal Gonzaga secured his release; but Platina,
Paul thought, would bear watching.</p>
<p>The leader of the humanists in Rome was Iulio Pomponio Leto,
allegedly the natural son of Prince Sanseverino of Salerno. Coming to
Rome in youth, he attached himself to Valla as a disciple, and succeeded
him as professor of Latin in the university. He became so enamored of
pagan literature that he lived and had his being not in the Rome of

<p>or Paul II, but in that of the Catos or the Caesars. He was the first
to edit the agricultural classics of Varro and Columella, and he
sedulously fol- lowed their precepts in tending his vineyard. He
remained content in learned poverty, spent half his time among the
historic ruins, wept at their spoliation and desolation, Latinized his
name to Pomponius Laetus, and walked to his classroom in ancient Roman
dress. Hardly any hall could hold the crowd that gathered at dawn to
hear his lectures; some students came at midnight to secure a place. He
despised the Christian religion, de- nounced its preachers as
hypocrites, and trained his scholars in the Stoic rather than the
Christian morality. His home was a museum of Roman antiquities, a
meeting place for students and teachers of Roman lore. About 1460 he
organized them into a Roman Academy, whose members took pagan names,
gave such names to their children in baptism, exchanged the Christian
faith for a religious worship of the genius of Rome, performed Latin
comedies, and celebrated the anniversary of Rome’s foundation with pagan
ceremonies in which the officiating members were termed sacerdotes, and
Laetus was called pontifex maximus. Some enthusiastic members dreamed of
restoring the Roman Republic. 40</p>
<p>Early in 1468 a citizen laid before the papal police a charge that
the</p>
<p>Academy was plotting to depose and arrest the Pope. Certain cardinals
supported the charge, and assured the pontiff that a rumor in Rome was
predicting his early death. Paul ordered the arrest of Laetus, Platina,
and other leaders of the Academy. Pomponius wrote humble apologies and
professions of orthodoxy; after due chastening he was released, and re-
sumed his lecturing, but with such careful conformity that when he died
(1498) forty bishops attended his funeral. Platina was tortured to
elicit evidence of a conspiracy; no such evidence was anywhere found,
but Platina, despite a dozen letters of apology, was kept in prison for
a year. Paul decreed the dissolution of the Academy as a nest of heresy,
and for- bade the teaching of pagan literature in the schools of Rome.
His successor allowed the Academy to reopen reformed, and gave the
penitent Platina charge of the Vatican Library. There Platina found the
materials for his graphic and elegant biographies of the popes (In vitas
summorum pontifi- cum ) ; and when he came to Paul II he took his
revenge. His indictment might with more justice have been reserved for
Sixtus IV.</p>

<p>was Greek. One participant later described the election of Cardinal
Fran- cesco della Rovere as due to “intrigue and bribery” (ex artibus et
cor - ruptelis), 41 but this seems to have meant only that various
offices were promised to various cardinals for their votes. The new pope
illustrated the admirable equality of opportunity (among Italians) to
reach the pa- pacy. He was born of a peasant family at Pecorile, near
Savona. Re-</p>
<p>peatedly ill as a child, he was consecrated to St. Francis by his
mother in prayer for his recovery. At nine he was sent to a Franciscan
convent, and later entered the Minorite order. For a while he served as
tutor in the della Rovere family, whose name he took as his own. He
studied philosophy and theology at Pavia, Bologna, and Padua, and taught
them there and else- where to classes so crowded that almost every
learned Italian of the next generation was said to have been his
pupil.</p>
<p>When, at fifty-seven, he became Sixtus IV, his reputation was that of
a scholar distinguished for learning and integrity. Almost overnight, by
one of the strangest transformations in papal history, he became a
politician and a warrior. Finding Europe too divided, and its
governments too cor- rupt, for a crusade against the Turks, he decided
to confine his secular efforts to Italy. There too, of course, he found
division — in the Papal States the authority of the pope largely flouted
by local rulers, in Latium a rule by noble violence ignoring the papal
power, and in Rome a mob so dis- orderly that at his coronation it
stoned his litter in anger at a crush caused by a stoppage of the
cavalcade. Sixtus proposed to restore order in Rome, to reinvigorate
legatine authority in the Papal States, and to bring Italy under the
unifying rule of the pope.</p>
<p>Surrounded by chaos, distrustful of strangers, and subject to
family</p>
<p>affection, Sixtus appointed his avid nephews to positions of power
and revenue. It was the prime curse of his pontificate that those whom
he loved best proved worst, and took such venal advantage of their place
that all Italy came to despise them. The favorite nephew was Pietro (or
Piero) Riario, a youth of some charm — cheerful, witty, courteous,
generous — but so fond of luxury and sensual delights that even the rich
benefices bestowed upon him by the Pope failed to finance the tastes of
this formerly mendicant friar. Sixtus made him a cardinal at twenty-five
(1471), and gave him the bishoprics of Treviso, Senigallia, Spalato,
Florence, and other dignities, with a total income of 60,000 ducats
(,500,000?) a year. Pietro spent all, and more, on vessels of silver and
gold, fine raiment, tapestries, embroideries, a pretentious retinue,
expensive public games, and the patronage of painters, poets, and
scholars. The festivities — including a banquet that lasted six</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 395</p>
<p>hours — with which he and his cousin Giuliano welcomed to Rome Fer-
rante’s daughter Eleonora marked a height of extravagance hardly equaled
there since Lucullus or Nero. Dizzy with power, Pietro made a triumphal
tour of Florence, Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, and Milan, enjoying regal
hon- ors everywhere as a prince of the blood, displaying his mistresses
in costly attire, and making plans to become pope on or before the death
of his uncle. But on his return to Rome he died (1474) of his excesses
at the age of twenty-eight, having spent 200,000 ducats in two years,
and owing 60,000 more. 42 His brother Girolamo was made commander of the
papal armies and lord of Imola and Forli; we have already disposed of
him there. An- other nephew, Leonardo della Rovere, was made prefect of
Rome; and when he died his brother Giovanni succeeded him. The ablest of
these innumerable nephews was Giuliano della Rovere, who will require a
chap- ter as Julius II; his life was reasonably decent, and he rose to
the papacy over every obstacle by force of intellect and character.</p>
<p>The plans of Sixtus to strengthen the Papal States disturbed the
other governments of Italy. Lorenzo de’ Medici, as we have before
related, schemed to get Imola for Florence; Sixtus outplayed him, and
replaced the Medici with the Pazzi as bankers for the papacy; Lorenzo
tried to ruin the Pazzi, they tried to kill him. Sixtus agreed to the
conspiracy but dep- recated murder; “go and do what you will,” he told
the plotters, “provided there be no killing.” 43 The result was a war
that lasted (1478 -80) until the Turks threatened to overrun Italy. When
that danger subsided, Sixtus was free to resume his liberation of the
Papal States. Late in 1480 the Ordelaffi line of dictators died out at
Forli, and the people asked the Pope to take over the city; Sixtus bade
Girolamo govern Imola and Forli together. Girolamo suggested taking
Ferrara next, and persuaded Sixtus and Venice to join in war upon Duke
Ercole (1482). Ferrante of Naples sent troops to defend his son-in-law;
Florence and Milan also helped Ferrara; and the Pope, who had begun his
reign with plans for European peace, found that he had plunged all Italy
into war. Harassed by Naples in the south, by Florence in the north, and
by disturbances in Rome, Sixtus came to terms with Ferrara after a year
of chaos and bloodshed. When the Venetians refused to follow suit he
excommunicated them, and joined Florence and Milan in war upon his late
ally.</p>
<p>The nobles of the capital had felt justified, by the example of a
warlike pontiff, in renewing their exhilarating feuds. It was one of the
polite cus- toms of Rome to plunder the palace of a cardinal just
elected to the papacy. In so handling the palace of one of the della
Rovere cardinals, a young</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>aristocrat, Francesco di Santa Croce, had been wounded by a member of
the della Valle family. The youth revenged himself by cutting the tendon
of della Valle’s heel; della Valle’s relatives revenged him by cleaving
Fran - cesco’s head; Prospero di Santa Croce revenged Francesco by
killing Piero Margani. The feud spread through the city, the Orsini and
the papal forces supporting the Santa Croce, the Colonna defending the
Valle. Lorenzo Oddone Colonna was captured, tried, tortured into a
confession, and put to death in Sant’ Angelo, though his brother
Fabrizio surrendered two Colonna fortresses to Sixtus in the hope of
having Lorenzo spared. Pros- pero Colonna joined Naples in war on the
Pope, ravaged the Campagna, raided Rome. Sixtus engaged Roberto
Malatesta of Rimini to come and lead the papal troops, Roberto defeated
the Neapolitan and Colonna forces at Campo Morto, returned to Rome
victorious, and died of fever contracted in the Campagna swamps.
Girolamo Riario took his place, and Sixtus of- ficially blessed the
artillery that his nephew directed against the Colonna citadels. But
while the Pope’s spirit willed war, his body collapsed under the strain
of successive crises. In June, 1484, he too came down with fever. On
August 1 1 news came to him that his allies had made peace with Venice
over his protests; he refused to ratify it. The next day he died.</p>
<p>Sixtus was in many ways a preview of Julius II, as Girolamo Riario
re- hearsed the career of Caesar Borgia. A stern imperial priest who
loved war and art and power, Sixtus pursued his purposes without scruple
or finesse, but with wild energy and unhesitating courage to the end.
Like later war- rior popes, he made enemies who tried to weaken his arms
by blackening his name. Some gossips accounted for his lavish support of
Pietro and Girolamo Riario by calling them his sons; 44 others, like
Infessura, called them his lovers, and did not hesitate to term the Pope
“a sodomite.” 45 * The picture is bad enough without these incredible
and unsupported allegations. After exhausting on his nephews the
treasury that Paul II had left full, Sixtus financed his wars by selling
ecclesiastical offices to the highest bid- der. A hostile Venetian
ambassador quotes him as saying that “a pope needs only pen and in k to
get whatever sum he wishes”; 47 but this is equally true of most modern
governments, whose interest-bearing bonds corre- spond in many ways with
the salary-bearing sinecures sold by the popes. Sixtus, however, was not
content with this scheme. He kept throughout</p>

<li>Stefano Infessura composed a Diario della citta di Roma , a history

also a partisan of the Colonna; he cannot be trusted when he retails
stories, not elsewhere confirmed, about the wickedness of the popes .

<p>CHAP. XV) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 397</p>
<p>the Papal States a monopoly on the sale of corn; he sold the best
abroad, and the rest to his people, at a goodly profit. 48 He had
learned this trick from the other rulers of his time, like Ferrante of
Naples; presumably he charged no more than private engrossers would have
done, since it is an unwritten law of economics that the price of a
product depends on the gullibility of the purchaser; but the poor
grumbled forgivably at the</p>
<p>thought that their hunger fed the luxuries of the Riarios. Despite
these and other devices for raising revenues, Sixtus left debts totaling
150,000 ducats (,750,000?).</p>
<p>A substantial portion of his revenues was spent on art and public
works. He tried, unsuccessfully, to drain the pestilential marshes
around Foligno, and at least dreamt of draining the Pontine swamps. He
had the major streets of Rome straightened, widened, and paved; he
improved the water supply; restored bridges, walls, gates, and towers;
spanned the Tiber with the Ponte Sisto that bears his name; built a new
Vatican Library, and the Sistine Chapel above it; founded the Sistine
Choir; and rebuilt the ruined Hospital of Santo Spirito, whose main
ward, 365 feet long, could accom- modate a thousand patients. He
reorganized the University of Rome, and opened to the public the
Capitoline Museum that Paul II had established; this was the first
public museum in Europe. During his pontificate, and largely under the
direction of Baccio Pontelli, the churches of Santa Maria della Pace and
Santa Maria del Popolo were erected, and many others were repaired. In
Santa Maria del Popolo Mino da Fiesole and Andrea Bregno sculptured a
noble tomb for Cardinal Cristoforo della Rovere (c. 1477); and in Santa
Maria in Aracoeli Pinturicchio pictured the career of San Bernardino of
Siena in some of the finest frescoes in Rome (c. 1484).</p>
<p>The Sis tine Chapel was designed by Giovannino de’ Dolci, simply and
unpretentiously, for semiprivate worship by the popes and high
ecclesias- tics. It was beautified with a marble sanctuary screen by
Mino da Fiesole, and by spacious frescoes recounting on the south wall
scenes from the life of Moses, and on the north wall corresponding
scenes from the life of Christ. For these paintings Sixtus called to
Rome the greatest masters of the time: Perugino, Signorelli,
Pinturicchio, Domenico and Benedetto Ghir- landaio, Botticelli, Cosimo
Roselli, and Piero di Cosimo. Sixtus offered an additional reward for
the best picture of the fifteen painted there by these men. Roselli,
knowing his own inferiority in design, decided to stake all on brilliant
coloring; his fellow artists laughed at his lavish spread of ultra-
marine and gold; but Sixtus gave him the prize.</p>
<p>The warrior pope brought other painters to Rome, and organized
them</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>into a protective guild under the aegis of St. Luke. It was for
Sixtus that Melozzo da Forli did his best work. Coming to Rome about
1472 after studying with Piero della Francesca, he painted in the church
of Santi Apostoli a fresco of the Ascension which aroused the enthusiasm
of Vasari; all but a few fragments of it disappeared when the church was
rebuilt (i702f). Gracious and tender are the Angel and the Virgin of the
Annun- ciation in the Uffizi Gallery, but finer still the Angeli music
anti — one. with a viol, one with a lute — in the V atican. Melozzo’s
masterpiece was painted as a fresco in the Vatican Library, and was
later transferred to canvas. Against the ornate pillars and ceiling of
the Library six figures are por- trayed with veracity and power: Sixtus
seated, massive and regal; at his right the gay Pietro Riario; standing
before him the tall dark Giuliano della Rovere; kneeling before him the
high-browed Platina, receiving appoint- ment as librarian; and behind
him Giovanni della Rovere and Count Giro- lamo Riario; it is a living
picture of an eventful pontificate.</p>
<p>In 1475 the Vatican Library contained 2527 volumes in Latin and
Greek; Sixtus added 1 100 more, and for the first time threw the
collection open to the public. He restored the humanists to favor,
though he paid them with preoccupied irregularity. He called Filelfo to
Rome, and that warrior of the pen praised the Pope enthusiastically
until his annual salary of 600 florins (5,000) fell into arrears.
Joannes Argyropoulos was invited from Florence to Rome, where his
lectures on the Greek language and literature were attended by
cardinals, bishops, and foreign students like Reuchlin. Sixtus also
brought to Rome the German scientist Johann Muller — Regio- montanus —
and commissioned him to correct the Julian calendar; but Muller died a
year later (1476), and calendar reform had to wait a century more</p>
<p>O582).</p>
<p>It is remarkable that a Franciscan friar and professor of philosophy
and theology should have become the first secularizing pope of the
Renaissance — or, more precisely, the first Renaissance pope whose chief
interest was to establish the papacy as a strong political power in
Italy. Perhaps excepting the case of Ferrara, whose able rulers had
faithfully paid their feudal dues, Sixtus was perfectly justified in
seeking to make the Papal States papal, and to make Rome and its
environs safe for the popes. History might forgive, as it has forgiven
Julius II, his use of war for these ends; it might acknowl- edge that
his diplomacy merely followed the amoral principles of other states; but
it finds no pleasure in watching a pope conspire with assassins, bless
cannon, or wage war with a thoroughness that shocked his time; the death
of a thousand men at Campo Morto was a heavier loss of life than any</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 399</p>
<p>battle yet fought in Renaissance Italy. The morality of the Roman
court was further lowered by reckless nepotism and unblushing simony,
and the costly indecent revels of his kin; in these and other ways
Sixtus IV made straight the way for Alexander VI, and contributed — as
he responded — to the moral disintegration of Italy. It was Sixtus who
appointed Torquemada to head the Spanish Inquisition; Sixtus who,
provoked by the virulence and license of Roman satire, gave the
Inquisitors in Rome power to prohibit the printing of any book they did
not like. At his death he might have ad- mitted many failures — against
Lorenzo, Naples, Ferrara, Venice — and even the Colonna were not yet
subdued. Three significant successes he had achieved: he had made Rome a
fairer and healthier city, he had given it invigorating drafts of fresh
art, and he had restored the papacy to its place among the most powerful
monarchies in Europe.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>INNOCENT VIII: 1 484-9 2</li>
</ol>
<p>The failure of Sixtus was confirmed by the chaos that ruled Rome
after his death. Mobs sacked the papal granaries, broke into the banks
of the Genoese, attacked the palace of Girolamo Riario. Vatican
attendants stripped the Vatican of its furniture. The noble factions
armed themselves; barricades were thrown up in the streets; Girolamo was
forced to quit his campaign against the Colonna and lead his troops back
to the city; the Colonna recaptured many of their citadels. A conclave
was hastily as- sembled in the Vatican, and an exchange of promises and
bribes 49 between Cardinal Borgia and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere
secured the election of Giovanni Battista Cibo of Genoa, who took the
name of Innocent VIII.</p>
<p>He was fifty-two; tall and handsome, kindly and peaceable to the
point of complaisant weakness; of moderate intelligence and experience;
a con- temporary described him as “not wholly ignorant .” 50 He had at
least one son and one daughter, probably more ; 51 he acknowledged them
candidly, and after taking priestly orders he led an apparently celibate
life. Though the Roman wits wrote epigrams about his children, few
Romans held it againt the Pope that he had been so fertile in his youth.
But they raised eyebrows when he celebrated the marriages of his
children and grand- children in the Vatican.</p>
<p>In truth Innocent was content to be a grandfather, to enjoy domestic
affection and ease. He gave Politian two hundred ducats for dedicating
to him a translation of Herodotus, but for the rest he hardly bothered
his head about the humanists. He continued leisurely, and quite by
proxy, the repair</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>and adornment of Rome. He engaged Antonio Pollaiuolo to build the
Villa Belvedere in the Vatican gardens, and Andrea Mantegna to paint
frescoes in a chapel adjoining it; but for the most part he left the
patronage of letters and art to magnates and cardinals. In a similar
mood of genial laissez-faire he entrusted foreign policy first to
Cardinal della Rovere, then to Lorenzo de’ Medici. The powerful banker
offered his richly dowered daughter</p>
<p>The age of Innocent was amused by one of the strangest comedies in
history. After the death of Mohammed II (1481) his sons Bajazet II and
Djem fought a civil war for the Ottoman throne. Defeated at Brusa, Djem
sought to escape death by surrendering to the Knights of St. John in
Rhodes (1482). Their Grand Master, Pierre d’Aubusson, held him as a
threat over Bajazet. The Sultan agreed to pay the Knights 45,000 ducats
yearly, osten- sibly for Djem’s maintenance, actually as an inducement
not to set up Djem as a pretender to the Turkish sultanate and a useful
ally in a Christian cru- sade. To better safeguard so lucrative a
prisoner, d’Aubusson sent him to Knightly custody in France. The Sultan
of Egypt, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, Matthias Corvinus of Hungary,
Ferrante of Naples, and Innocent himself all offered large sums to
d’Aubusson to transfer Djem to their care.</p>
<p>Despite the Sultan’s contribution to the support of the Church,
Innocent found it troublesome to make ends meet. Like Sixtus IV and most
of the rulers of Europe, he replenished his coffers by charging fees for
appoint-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE RENAISSANCE CAPTURES ROME 401</p>
<p>ment to office; and finding this lucrative, he created new offices to
sell. By raising the number of papal secretaries to twenty-six, he
realized 62,400 ducats; he increased to fifty-two the plumbatores whose
heavy task was to place a leaden seal on papal decrees, and received
2500 ducats from each appointee. Such practices might have been no worse
than selling annuity insurance, had it not been that the incumbents
reimbursed themselves not merely by their salaries but by candid
venality in their functions. For ex- ample, two papal secretaries
confessed that in two years they had forged more than fifty papal bulls
granting dispensations; the angry Pope had the men hanged and burned for
stealing beyond their station (1489). 52 Every- thing in Rome seemed
purchasable, from judicial pardons to the papacy it- self. 53 The
unreliable Infessura tells of a man who committed incest with his two
daughters, then murdered them, and was let off by paying eight hun- dred
ducats. 54 When Cardinal Borgia was asked why justice was not done, he
is reputed to have answered: “God desires not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he sho uld pay and live.” 55 The Pope’s son, Franceschetto
Cibo, was an unprincipled scoundrel; he forced his way into private
homes “for evil purposes”; he saw to it that of the fines levied in the
ecclesiastical courts</p>
<p>The secularization of the papacy — its absorption in politics, war,
and finance — had filled the college of cardinals with appointees noted
for their administrative ability, their political influence, or their
capacity to pay for their hats. Despite his promise to keep the College
down to twenty-four members, Innocent added to it eight men most of whom
were eminently unsuited to such a dignity; so the cardinalate was
conferred upon the thir- teen-year- old Giovanni de’ Medici as part of a
bargain with Lorenzo. Many of the cardinals were men of high education,
benevolent patrons of literature, music, drama, and art. A few of them
were saintly. Several had taken only minor orders, and were not yet
priests. Many of them were frankly secular; their political, diplomatic,
and fiscal duties required them to be men of the world, capable of
meeting on a level of knowledge and sub- tlety the similar officials of
Italian or transalpine governments. Some of them imitated the Roman
nobles, fortified their palaces and retained armed</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>men to protect themselves from these nobles, and the Roman mob, and
other cardinals. 57 * Perhaps the great Catholic historian Pastor is a
bit too severe on them, in view of their secular functions:</p>
<p>Lorenzo de’ Medici’s low estimate of the College of Cardinals in</p>
<p>the time of Innocent VIII was unfortunately only too well
founded.</p>
<p>… Of the worldly cardinals Ascanio Sforza, Riario, Orsini, Scla-</p>
<p>fenatus, Jean de la Balue, Giuliano della Rovere, Savelli, and
Rodrigo Borgia were the most prominent. All of these were deeply
infected</p>
<p>with the corruption that prevailed in Italy amongst the upper classes
in the age of the Renaissance. Surrounded in their splendid palaces</p>
<p>with all the most refined luxury of a highly developed
civilization,</p>
<p>these cardinals lived the lives of secular princes, and seemed to
regard their ecclesiastical garb simply as one of the adornments of
their</p>
<p>rank. They hunted, gambled, gave sumptuous banquets and enter-</p>
<p>tainments, joined in all the rollicking merriment of the
carnival-tide, and allowed themselves the utmost license in morals. This
was espe- cially the case with Rodrigo Borgia. 58</p>
<p>The disorder at the top reflected and enhanced the moral chaos of
Rome. Violence, thievery, rape, bribery, conspiracy, revenge were the
order of the day. Each dawn revealed, in the alleys, men who had been
killed during the night. Pilgrims and ambassadors were waylaid, were
sometimes stripped naked, as they approached the capital of Christendom.
55 Women were attacked in the streets or in their homes. A piece of the
True Cross, encased in silver, was stolen from the sacristy of Santa
Maria in Trastevere; later the wood, shorn of its setting, was found in
a vineyard.”“ Such religious skep - ticism was widespread. Over five
hundred Roman families were con- demned for heresy, but were let off
with fines; perhaps the mercenary Curia of Rome was preferable to the
mercenary and murderous inquisitors who were now ravaging Spain. Even
priests had their doubts; one was ac- cused of substituting, for the
words of transubstantiation in the Mass, his own formula: “O fatuous
Christians, who adore food and drink as God!” 61 As the end of
Innocent’s pontificate approached, prophets appeared who proclaimed
impending doom; and in Florence the voice of Savonarola was rising to
brand the age as that of Antichrist.</p>
<p>“On September 20,” 1492, says a chronicler, “there was a great tumult
in the city of Rome, and the merchants closed their shops. People who
were in the fields and vineyards returned home in haste, because it was
announced</p>
<ul>
<li>In a consistory of June, 1486, Cardinal Borgia reproached Cardinal
Balue for being drunk; to which Balue responded by calling the future
