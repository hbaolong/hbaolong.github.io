<p>T HE T’ang Dynasty never rec overed from the revolution of An</p>
<p>Lu-shan. The emperors who followed Ming Huang were unable to</p>
<p>restore the imperial authority throughout the Empire; and after a
cen- tury of senile debility the dynasty came to an end. Five dynasties
fol- lowed in fifty-three years, but they were as feeble as they were
brief. As always in such cases a strong and brutal hand was needed to
reestablish order. One soldier emerged above the chaos, and set up the
Sung Dynasty, with himself as its first emperor under the name of T’ai
Tsu. The bu - reaucracy of Confucian officials was renewed, examinations
for office were resumed, and an attempt was made by an imperial
councillor to solve the problems of exploitation and poverty by an
almost socialist con- trol over the nati on’s economic life.</p>
<p>Wang An-shih (1021-86) is one of the many fascinating individuals</p>
<p>who enliven the lengthy annals of Chinese history. It is part of the
bathos of distance that our long removal from alien scenes obscures
variety in places and men, and submerges the most diverse personalities
in a dull uniformity of appearance and character. But even in the
judgment of his enemies — whose very number distinguished him — Wang
stood out as a man different from the rest, absorbed conscientiously in
the enterprise of government, devoted recklessly to the welfare of the
people, leaving himself no time for the care of his person or his
clothes, rivaling the great</p>
<p>7H</p>
<p>THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>7 2 5</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>scholars of his age in learning and style, and fighting with mad
courage the rich and powerful conservatives of his age. By a trick of
chance the only great figure in the records of his country who resembled
him was his namesake Wang Mang; already the turbid stream of history had
trav- e led a thousand years since China’s last outstanding experiment
with social - ist ideas.</p>
<p>On receiving the highest office in the command of the Emperor, Wang
An-shih laid it down as a general principle that the government must
hold itself responsible for the welfare of all its citizens. “The
state,” he said, “should take the entire management of commerce,
industry and agricul - ture into its own hands, with a view to succoring
the working classes and preventing them from being ground into the dust
by th e rich .” 1 He began by abolishing the forced labor that had from
time immemorial been exacted from the Chinese people by the government,
and had often taken men from the fields at the very time when the sowing
or the harvesting needed them; and nevertheless he carried out great
engineering works for the prevention of floods. He rescued the peasants
from the money-lenders who had enslaved them, and lent them, at what
were then low rates of interest, funds for the planting of their crops.
To the unemployed he gave free seed and other aid in setting up
homesteads, on condition that they would repay the state out of the
yield of their land. Boards were appointed in every district to regulate
the wages of labor and the prices of the necessaries of life. Commerce
was nationalized; the produce of each locality was bought by the
government, part of it was stored for future local needs, and the rest
was transported to be sold in state depots throughout the realm. A
budget system was established, a budget com- mission submitted proposals
and estimates of expenditure, and these esti- mates were so strictly
adhered to in administration that the state was saved considerable sums
which had previously fallen into those secret and spacious pockets that
cross the path of every governmental dollar. Pen- sions were provided
for the aged, the unemployed and the poor. Educa- tion and the
examination system were reformed; the tests were devised to reveal
acquaintance with facts rather than with words, and to shift the
emphasis from literary style to the application of Confucian principles
to current tasks; the role of formalism and rote memory in the training
of children was reduced, and for a time, says a Chinese historian, “even
the pupils at village schools threw away their text-books of rhetoric
and began to study primers of history, geography, and political
economy.’”</p>
<p>7 26 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>Why did this noble experiment fail? First, perhaps, because of
certain elements in it that were more practical than Utopian. Though
most of the taxes were taken from the incomes of the rich, part of the
heavy revenue needed for the enlarged expenses of the state was secured
by ap- propriating a portion of the produce of every field. Soon the
poor joined with the rich in complaining that taxes were too high; men
are always readier to extend governmental functions than to pay for
them. Further, Wang An-shih had reduced the standing army as a drain on
the resources of the people, but had, as a means of replacing it,
decreed the universal liability of every family of more than one male to
provide a soldier in time of war. He had presented many families with
horses and fodder, but on condition that the animals should be properly
cared for, and be placed at the service of the government in its
military need. When it turned out that invasion and revolution were
multiplying the occasions of war, these measures brought Wang An- shih’s
popularity to a rapid end. Again, he had found it difficult to secure
honest men to administer his measures; corruption spread throughout the
mammoth bureaucracy, and China, like many nations since, saw itself
faced with the ancient and bitter choice between private plunder and
public “graft.”</p>
<p>Conservatives , led by Wang’s own brother and by the historian Szuma
Kuang, denounced the experiment as inherently unsound; they argued that
human corruptibility and incompetence made governmental control of
industry impracticable, and that the best form of government was a
laissez-faire which would rely on the natural economic impulses of men
for the production of services and goods. The rich, stung by the high
taxation of their fortunes and the monopoly of commerce by the govern-
ment, poured out their resources in the resolve to discredit the
measures of Wang An-shih, to obstruct their enforcement, and to bring
them to a disgraceful end. The opposition, well organized, exerted
pressure on the Emperor; and when a succession of floods and droughts
was capped by the appearance of a terrifying comet in the sky, the Son
of Heaven dis- missed Wang from office, revoked his decrees, and called
his enemies to power. Once again everything was as before . 8</p>

<p>The growth of scholarship — Paper and ink in China — Steps in the</p>
<p>invention of printing — The oldest book — Paper money —</p>
<p>Movable type — Anthologies , dictionaries, encyclopedias</p>
<p>Meanwhile, through all wars and revolutions, through all administra-
tions and experiments, the life of the Chinese people flowed evenly on,
not much disturbed by events too distant to be heard of until long since
past. The Sung rule was overthrown in the north, but reestablished
itself in the south; the cap ital was moved from Pien Liang (now
K’aifeng) to Lin-an (now Hangchow); in the new capital, as in the old,
luxury and refinement grew, and traders came from many parts of the
world to buy the unmatched products of Chinese industry and art. Emperor
Hui Tsung ( 1 101-25) set the fashion at Pien Liang by being an artist
first and a ruler afterward: he painted pictures while the barbarians
marched upon his capital, and founded an art academy that stimulated
with exhibitions and prizes the arts that were to be the chief claim of
the Sung era to the re- membrance of mankind. Inspiring collections were
made of Chinese bronzes, paintings, manuscripts and jades; great
libraries were collected, and some of them survived the glories of war.
Scholars and artists crowded the northern and southern capitals.</p>
<p>It was in this dynasty that printing entered like an imperceptibly
com- pleted revolution into the literary life of the Chinese. It had
grown step by step through many centuries; now it was ready in both its
phases — blocks to print whole pages, and movable type cast of metal in
matrices — as a thoroughly Chinese invention, 1 the greatest, after
writing, in the his- tory of our race.</p>
<p>The first step in the development had to be the discovery of some
more convenient writing material than the silk or bamboo that had
contented the ancient Chinese. Silk was expensive, and bamboo was heavy;
Mo Ti needed three carts to carry with him, in his travels, the bamboo
books that were his chief possession; and Shih Huang-ti had to go over
one hundred and twenty pounds of state documents every day. 6 About 105
a.d. one Ts’ai Lun informed the Emperor that he had invented a cheaper
and lighter writing material, made of tree bark, hemp, rags and fish-
nets. Ts’ai was given a high title and office by the Emperor, was
involved in an intrigue with the Empress, was detected, “went home, took
a bath, combed his hair, put on his best</p>
<p>7^8 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>robes, and drank poison.” 0 The new art sp read rapidly and far, for
the oldest existing paper, found by Sir Aurel Stein in a spur of the
Great Wall, is in the form of state documents pertaining to occurrences
in the years 21-137 A - D *&gt; an d apparently contemporary with the
latest of those events; it is dated, therefore, about 150 a.d., only
half a century after Ts’ai Lun’s report of his invention. 7 These early
papers were of pure rag, essentially like the paper used in our own day
when durability is desired. The Chinese developed paper al most to
perfection by using a “sizing” of glue or gelatin, and a base of starchy
paste, to strengthen the fibres and accelerate their absorption of ink.
When the art was taught by the Chinese to the Arabs in the eighth
century, and by the Arabs to Europe in the thirteenth, it was already
complete.</p>
<p>Ink, too, came from the East; for though the Egyptian had made both
ink and paper in what might be called the most ancient antiquity, it was
from China that Europe learned the trick of mixing it out of lam p
black; “India ink” was originally Chinese. 8 Red ink, made of sulphide
of mercury, had been used in China as far back as the Han Dynasty; black
ink appeared there in the fourth century, and henceforth the use of red
ink was made an imperial privilege. Black ink encouraged printing, for
it was especially adapted for use on wooden blocks, and enjoyed almost
complete indelibility. Blocks of paper have been found, in Central Asia,
which had lain under water so long as to become petrified; but the
writing, in ink, could still be clearly read. 9</p>
<p>The use of seals in signatures was the unconscious origin of print;
the Chinese word for print is still the same as the word for seal. At
first these seals, as in the Near East, were impressed upon clay; about
the fifth century they were moistened with ink. Meanwhile, in the second
century, the text of the Classics had been cut in stone; and soon
thereafter the custom arose of making inked rubbings from these
inscriptions. In the sixth century we find large wooden seals used by
the Taoists to print charms; a century later the Buddhist missionaries
experimented with various methods of duplication, through seals,
rubbings, stencils, and textile prints — the last an art of Indian
derivation. The earliest extant block prints are a million charms
printed in Japan about 770 a.d., in the Sanskrit language and the
Chinese character — an excellent instance of cultural interaction in
Asia. Many block prints were made during the T’ang Dynasty, but they
were apparen tly destroyed or lost in the chaos of revolution that
followed Ming Huang. 10</p>
<p>In 1907 Sir Aurel Stein persuaded the Taoist priests of Chinese
Turkestan to let him examine the “Caves of the Thousand Buddhas” at Tun
-huang. In one of these chambers, which had apparently been walled up
about the year 1035 a.d. and not opened again until 1900, lay 1130
bundles, each con-</p>

<p>taining a dozen or more manuscript rolls; the whole formed a library
of 15,000 books, written on paper, and as well preserved as if they had
been inscribed the day before their modern discovery. It was among these
manu- scripts that the world’s oldest printed book was found— the
“Diamond Sutra” —a roll ending with these words: “Printed on (the
equivalent of) May 11, 868, by Wang Chieh, for free general
distribution, in order in deep reverence to perpetuate the memory of his
parents.” 11 Three other printed books were</p>
<p>These early volumes had been printed with wooden blocks. In a Chinese
letter written about 870 a.d. we find the oldest known mention of such
work: “Once when I was in Szechuan I examined in a bookshop a school-
book printed from wood.” 18 Already, it seems, the art of printing had
been developed; and it is interesting to observe that this development
seems to have come first in western provinces like Szechuan and
Turkestan, which had been prodded on to civilization by Buddhist
missionaries from India, and had for a time enjoyed a culture
independent of the eastern capitals. Block-printing was introduced to
eastern China early in the tenth century when a prime minister, Feng
Tao, persuaded the Emperor to provide funds for the printing of the
Chinese Classics. The work took twenty years and filled one hundred and
thirty volumes, for it included not only the texts but the most famous
commentaries. When it was completed it gave the Classics a circulation
that contributed vigorously to the revival of learning and the
strengthening of Confucianism under the Sung kings.</p>
<p>One of the earliest forms of block printing was the manufacture
of</p>
<p>paper money. Appearing first in Szechuan in the tenth century, it
became a favorite occupation of Chinese governments, and led within a
century to experiments in inflation. In 1294 Persia imitated this new
mode of creating wealth; in 1297 Marco Polo described with wonder the
respect which the Chinese showed for these curious scraps of paper. It
was not till 1656 that Europe learned the trick, and issued its first
paper currency. 14</p>
<p>Movable type was also a Chinese invention, but the absence of an al-
phabet, and the presence of 40,000 characters in written Chinese, made
its use an impossible luxury in the Far East. Pi Sheng formed movable
type of</p>
<p>730 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>earthenware as early as 1041 a.d., but little use was found for the
invention. In 1403 the Koreans produced the first metal type known to
history: models were engraved in hard wood, moulds of porcelain paste
were made from these models, and from these moulds, baked in an oven,
the metal type was cast. The greatest of Korean emperors, T’ai Tsung, at
once a dopted the invention as an aid to government and the preservation
of civilization. “Whoever is desirous of governing,” said that
enlightened monarch, “must have a wide acquaintance with the laws and
the Classics. Then he will be able to act righteously without, and to
maintain an upright character within, and thus to bring peace and order
to the land. Our eastern country lies beyond the seas, and the number of
books reaching us from China is small. The books printed from blocks are
often imperfect, and moreover it is difficult to print in their entirety
all the books that exist. I ordain there- fore that characters be formed
of bronze, and that everything without ex- ception upon which I can lay
my hands be printed, in order to pass on the tradition of what these
works contain. That will be a blessing to us to all eternity. However,
the costs shall not be taken from the people in taxes. I and my family,
and those ministers who so wish, will privately bear the expense.”
15</p>
<p>From Korea the casting of movable type spread to Japan and back again
to China, but not, apparently, until after Gutenberg’s belated discovery
in Europe. In Korea the use of movable type continued for two centuries
and then decayed; in China its use was only occasional until merchants
and mis- sionaries from the West, as if returning an ancient gift,
brought to the East the methods of European typography. From the days of
Feng Tao to those of Li Hung-chang the Chinese clung to block-printing
as the most feasible form for their language. Despite this limitation
Chinese printers poured out a great mass of books upon the people.
Dynastic histories in hundreds of volumes were issued between 994 and
1063; the entire Buddhist canon, in five thousand volumes, was completed
by 972. 18 Writers found them- selves armed with a weapon which they had
never had before; their audi- ence was widened from the aristocracy to
the middle, even to part of the lower, classes; literature took on a
more democratic tinge, and a more varied form. The art of block-printing
was one of the sources of the Sung</p>
<p>Renaissance.</p>
<p>Stimulated with this liberating invention, Chinese literature now
became an unprecedented flood. All the glory of the Humanist revival in
Italy was anticipated by two hundred years. The ancient classics were
honored with a hundred editions and a thousand commentaries; the life of
the past was captured by scholarly historians, and put down for millions
of readers</p>
<p>THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXv)</p>
<p>73 1</p>
<p>in the new marvel of type; vast anthologies of literature were
collected, great dictionaries were compiled, and encyclopedias like
mastodons made their way through the land. The first of any moment was
that of Wu Shu (947-1002); for lack of an alphabet it was arranged under
categories, covering chiefly the physical world. In 977 a.d. the Sung
Emperor T’ai Tsung ordered the compilation of a larger encyclopedia; it
ran to thirty- two volumes, and consisted for the most part of
selections from 1,690 pre- existing books. Later, under the Ming Emperor
Yung Lo (1403-25), an encyclopedia was written in ten thousand volumes,
and proved too ex- pensive to be printed; of the one copy handed down to
posterity all but one hundred and sixty volumes were consumed by fire in
the Boxer riots of 1900.” Never before had scholars so dominated a
civilization.</p>
<p>3 . The Rebirth of Philosophy</p>
<p>Chu H si — Wang Y ang-ming — B eyond good and evil</p>
<p>These scholars were not all Confucians, for rival schools of thought
had grown up in the course of fifteen centuries, and now the
intellectual life of the exuberant race was stirred with much argument
about it and about. The seepage of Buddhism into the Chinese soul had
reached even the philosophers. Most of them now affected a habit of
solitary meditation; some of them went so far as to scorn Confucius for
scorning metaphysics, and to reject his method of approach to the
problems of life and mind as too external and crude. Introspection
became an accepted method of ex- ploring the universe, and epistemology
made its first appearance among the Chinese. Emperors took up Buddhism
or Taoism as ways of promot- ing their popularity or of disciplining the
people; and at times it seemed that the reign of Confucius over the
Chinese mind was to end.</p>
<p>His saviour was Chu Hsi. Just as Shankara, in eighth-century
India,</p>
<p>had brought into an intellectual system the scattered insights of the
Upani- shads, and had made the Vedanta philosophy supreme; and just as
Aquinas, in thirteenth-century Europe, was soon to weave Aristotle and
St. Paul into the victorious Scholastic philosophy; so Chu Hsi, in
twelfth-</p>
<p>century China, took the loose apothegms of Confucius and built upon
them a system of philosophy orderly enough to satisfy the taste of a
scholarly age, and strong enough to preserve for seven centuries the
lead- ership of the Confucians in the political and intellectual life of
the Chinese.</p>
<p>73 2</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>The essential philosophic controversy of the time centered upon the
interpretation of a passage in the Great Learning, attributed by both
Chu Hsi and his opponents to Confucius.* What was meant by the
astonishing demand that the ordering of states should be based upon the
proper reg- ulation of the family, that the regulation of the family
should be based upon the regulation of one’s self, that the regulation
of one’s self depended</p>
<p>Chu Hsi answered that this meant just what it said; that philosophy,
morals and statesmanship should begin with a modest study of realities.
He accepted without protest the positivistic bent of the Master’s mind;
and though he labored over the problems of ontology at greater length
than Confucius might have approved, he arrived at a strange combination
of atheism and piety which might have interested the sage of Shantung.
Like the Book of Changes, which has always dominated the metaphysics of
the Chinese, Chu Hsi recognized a certain strident dualism in reality:
everywhere the Yang and the Yin — activity and passivity, motion and
rest — mingled like male and female principles, working on the five
elements of water, fire, earth, metal and wood to produce the phenomena
of crea- tion; and everywhere Li and Chi — Law and Matter — equally
external, cooperated to govern all things and give them form. But over
all these forms, and combining them, was T’ai chi, the Absolute, the
impersonal Law of Laws, or structure of the world. Chu Hsi identified
this Absolute with the T’ien or Heaven of orthodox Confucianism; God, in
his view, was a rational process without personality or figurable form.
“Nature</p>
<p>This Law of the universe is also, said Chu, the law of morals and
of</p>
<p>politics. Morality is harmony with the laws of nature, and the
highest statesmanship is the application of the laws of morality to the
conduct of a state. Nature in every ultimate sense is good, and the
nature of men is good; to follow nature is the secret of wisdom and
peace. “Choi Mao Shu refrained from clearing away the grass from in
front of his window, ‘because,’ he said, ‘its impulse is just like my
own.’” w One might con - clude that the instincts are also good, and
that one may follow them gayly; but Chu Hsi denounces them as the
expression of matter (Chi), and de- mands their subjection to reason and
law (Li). 10 It is difficult to be at once a moralist and a
logician.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>There were contradictions in this philosophy, but these did not
disturb its leading opponent, the gentle and peculiar Wang Yang-ming.
For</p>
<p>Wang was a saint as well as a philosopher; the meditative spirit and
habits of Mahay ana Buddhism had sunk deeply into his soul. It seemed to
him that the great error in Chu Hsi was not one of morals, but one of
method; the investigation of things, he felt, should begin not with the
examination of the external universe, but, as the Hindus had said, with
the far pro- founder and more revealing world of the inner self. Not all
the physical science of all the centuries would ever explain a bamboo
shoot or a grain of rice.</p>
<p>In former years I said to my friend Chien: “If, to be a sage or a</p>
<p>virtuous man, one must investigate everything under heaven, how</p>
<p>can at present any man possess such tremendous power?” Pointing to
the bamboos in front of the pavilion, I asked him to investigate</p>
<p>them and see. Both day and night Chien entered into an investiga-</p>
<p>tion of the principles of the bamboo. For three days he exhausted</p>
<p>his mind and thought, until his mental energy was tired out and
he</p>
<p>took sick. At first I said that it was because his energy and
strength</p>
<p>were insufficient. Therefore I myself undertook to carry on the</p>
<p>investigation. Day and night I was unable to understand the prin-</p>
<p>ciples of the bamboo, until after seven days I also became ill
be-</p>
<p>cause of having wearied and burdened my thoughts. In consequence we
mutually sighed and said, “We cannot be either sages or virtu -</p>
<p>ous men .” 21</p>
<p>So Wang Yang-ming put aside the examination of things, and put aside
even the classics of antiquity; to read one’s own h eart and mind in
solitary contemplation seemed to him to promise more wisdom than all
objects and all books . 22 Exiled to a mountainous wilderness inhabited
by bar- barians and infested with poisonous snakes, he made friends and
disciples of the criminals who had escaped to those parts; he taught
them philoso- phy, cooked for them, and sang them songs. Once, at the
midnight watch, he startled them by leaping from his cot and crying out
ecstatically: “My nature, of course, is sufficient. I was wrong in
looking for principles in things and affairs.” His comrades were not
sure that they followed him; but slowly he led them on to his idealistic
conclusion: “The mind itself is the embodiment of natural law. Is there
anything in the universe that exist s independent of the mind? Is there
any law apart from the mind ?” 23</p>
<p>734 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>He did not infer from this that God was a figment of the imagination;
on the contrary he conceived of the Deity as a vague but omnipresent
moral force, too great to be merely a person, and yet capable of feeling
sym- pathy and anger toward men . 24</p>
<p>From this idealistic starting-point he came to the same ethical
principles as Chu Hsi. “Nature is the highest good,” and the highest
excell ence lies in accepting the laws of Nature completely . 26 When it
was pointed out to him that Nature seems to include snakes as well as
philosophers, he replied, with a touch of Aquinas, Spinoza and
Nietzsche, that “good” and “bad” are prejudices, term s applied to
things according to their advantage or injury to one’s self or mankind;
Nature itself, he taught, is beyond good and evil, and ignores our
egoistic terminology. A pupil reports, or invents, a dialogue which
might have been entitled Jenseits von Gut und Bose:</p>
<p>A little later he said: “This view of good and evil has its
source</p>
<p>in the body, and is probably mistaken.” I was not able to compre
-</p>
<p>hend. The Teacher said: “The purpose of heaven in bringing forth</p>
<p>is even as in the instance of flowers and grass. In what way does
it</p>
<p>distinguish between good and evil? If you, my disciple, take de-</p>
<p>light in seeing the flowers, then you will consider flowers good
and</p>
<p>grass bad. If you desire to use the grass you will, in turn, con-</p>
<p>sider the grass good. This type of good and evil has its source in
the</p>
<p>likes and dislikes of your mind. Therefore I know that you are
mis-</p>
<p>taken.”</p>
<p>I said: “In that case there is neither good nor evil, is there?”</p>
<p>The Teacher said: “The tranquillity resulting from the dominance</p>
<p>of natural law is a state in which no discrimination is made between
good and evil; while the stirring of the passion-nature is a state
in</p>
<p>which both good and evil are present. If there are no stirrings of
the passion-nature, there is neither good nor evil, and this is what
is</p>
<p>called the highest good.” . . .</p>
<p>I said: “In that case good and evil are not at all present in</p>
<p>things?” He said: “They are only in your mind .” 26</p>
<p>It was well that Wang and Buddhism sounded this subtle note of an
idealist metaphysic in the halls of the correct and prim Confucians; for
though these scholars had the justest view of human nature and govern-
ment which philosophy had yet conceived, they were a trifle enamored of
their wisdom, and had become an intellectual bureaucracy irksome and
hostile to every free and creatively erring soul. If in the end the
followers</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 735</p>
<p>of Chu Hsi won the day, if his tablet was placed with high honors in
the same hall with that of the Master himself, and his interpretations
of the Classics became a law to all orthodox thought for seven hundred
years, it was indeed a victory of sound and simple sense over the
disturbing subtleties of the metaphysical mind. But a nation, like an
individual, can be too sensible, too prosaically sane and unbearably
right. It was partly because Chu Hsi and Confucianism triumphed so
completely that China had to have her Revolution.</p>

<p>The pursuit of wisdom and the passion for beauty are the two poles of
the Chinese mind, and China might loosely be defined as philosophy and
porcelain. As the pursuit of wisdom meant to China no airy meta- physic
but a positive philosophy aiming at individual development and social
order, so the passion for beauty was no esoteric estheticism, no
dilettante concoction of art forms irrelevant to human affairs, but an
earthly marriage of beauty and utility, a practical resolve to adorn the
objects and implements of daily life. Until it began to yield its own
ideals to Western influence, China refused to recognize any distinction
between the artist and the artisan, or between the artisan and the
worker; nearly all industry was wamwfacture, and all manufacture was
handicraft; in- dustry, like art, was the expression of personality in
things. Hence China, while neglecting to provide its people, through
large-scale industry, with conveniences common in the West, excelled
every country in artistic taste and the multiplication of beautiful
objects for daily use. From the characters in which he wrote to the
dishes from which he ate, the com- fortable Chinese demanded that
everything about him should have some esthetic fonn, and evidence in its
shape and texture the mature civilization of which it was a symbol and a
part.</p>
<p>It was during the Sung Dynasty that this movement to beautify the</p>
<p>person, the temple and the home reached its highest expression. It
had been a part of the excellence of T’ang life, and would remain and
spread under later dynasties; but now a long period of order and
prosperity nourished every art, and gave to Chinese living a grace and
adornment</p>
<p>736 the story of civilization (chap.xxv</p>
<p>which it had never enjoyed before. In textiles and metalworking the
craftsmen of China, during and after the Sung era, reached a degree of
perfection never surpassed; in the cutting of jade and hard stones they
went beyond all rivals anywhere; and in the carving of wood and ivory
they were excelled only by their pupils in Japan . 21 Furniture was
designed in a variety of unique and uncomfortable forms; cabinet-makers,
living on a bowl of rice per day, sent forth one objet de vertu — one
little piece of perfection — after another; and these minor products of
a Careful art, taking the place of expensive furniture and luxuries in
homes, gave to their owners a pleasure which in the Occident only
connoisseurs can know. Jewelry was not abundant, but it was admirably
cut. Women and men cooled themselves with ornate fans of feathers or
bamboo, of painted paper or silk; even beggars brandished elegant fans
as they plied their ancient trade.</p>
<p>The art of lacquer began in China, and came to its fullest
perfection</p>
<p>in Japan. In the Far East lacquer is the natural product of a tree*
in-</p>
<p>digenous to China, but now most sedulously cultivated by the
Japanese. The sap is drawn from trunk and branches, strained, and heated
to remove excess liquid; it is applied to thin wood, sometimes to metal
or porcelain, and is dried by exposure to moisture . 28 Twenty or thirty
coats, each slowly dried and painstakingly polished, are laid on, the
applications varying in color and depth; then, in China, the finished
lacquer is carved with a sharp V-shaped tool, each incision reaching to
such a layer as to expose the color required by the design. The art grew
slowly; it began as a</p>
<p>form of writing upon bamboo strips; the material was used in the Chou
Dynasty to decorate vessels, harness, carriages, etc.; in the second
century a.d. it was applied to buildings and musical instruments; under
the T’ang many lacquered articles were exported to Japan; under the Sung
all branches of the .industry took their definite form, and shipped
their products to such distant ports as India and Arabia; under the Ming
em- perors the art was further perfected, and in some phases reached its
zenith ; 28 under the e nlightened Manchu rulers K’ang - hsi and Ch’ien
Lung great factories were built and maintained by imperial decree, and
made such masterpieces as Ch’ien Lung’s throne,” or the lacquered screen

<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>wars brought on by European merchants, and the poor taste of European
importers and clients, caused the withdrawal of imperial support,
lowered the standards, debased the designs, and left the leadership in
lacquer to Japan.</p>
<p>Jade is as old as Chinese history, for it is found in the most
ancient</p>
<p>graves. The earliest records attribute its use as a “sound - stone”
to 2500 b.c.: jade was cut in the form of a fish or elsewise, and
suspended by a thong; when properly cut and struck it emitted a clear
musical tone, astonishingly long sustained. The word was derived through
the French jade from the Spanish ijada (Lat. ilia ) , meaning loins; the
Spanish con- querors of America found that the Mexicans used the stone,
powdered and mixed with water, as a cure for many internal disorders,
and they brought this new prescription back to Europe along with
American gold. The Chinese word for the stone is much more sensible; jun
means soft like the dew. ” Two minerals provide jade: jadeite and
nephrite— silicates in the one case of aluminium and sodium, in the
other of calcium and mag- nesium. Both are tough; the pressure of fifty
tons is sometimes required to crush a one-inch cube; large pieces are
usually broken by being sub- jected in quick succession first to extreme
heat and then to cold water. The ingenuity of the Chinese artist is
revealed in his ability to bring</p>
<p>lustrous colors of green, brown, black and white out of these
naturally colorless materials, and in the patient obstinacy with which
he varies the forms, so that in all the world’s collections of jade
(barring buttons) no two pieces are alike. Examples begin to appear as
far back as the Shang Dynasty, in the shape of a jade toad used in
divine sacrifice; 83 and forms of great beauty were produced in the days
of Confucius. 81 While various peoples used jadeite for axes, knives and
other utensils, the Chinese held the stone in such reverence that they
kept it almost exclusivly for art; they regarded it as more precious
than silver or gold, or any jewelry; 85 they valued some small jades,
like the thumb rings worn by the mandarins, at five thousand dollars,
and some jade necklaces at 00,000; collectors spent years in search of a
single piece. It has been estimated that an assemblage of all existing
Chinese jades would form a collection unrivaled by any other material.
89</p>
<p>Bronze is almost as old as jade in the art of China, and even more
exalted in Chinese reverence. Legend tells how the ancient Emperor Yii,
hero of the Chinese flood, cast the metals sent him as tribute by the
nine pro- vinces of his empire into the form of three nine-legged
cauldrons, possessed</p>
<p>73 8 the story of civilizatton (chap. XXV</p>
<p>of the magic power to ward off noxious influences, cause their
contents to boil without fire, and generate spontaneously every
delicacy. They became a sacred symbol of the imperial authority, were
handed down carefully from dynasty to dynasty, but disappeared
mysteriously on the fall of the Chou — a circumstance extremely
injurious to the prestige of Shih Huang-ti. The casting and decoration
of bronze became one of the fine arts of China, and produced collections
that required forty-two</p>
<p>volumes to catalogue them . 37 It made vessels for the religious
ceremonies of the government and the home, and transformed a thousand
varieties of utensils into works of art. Chinese bronzes are equaled
only by the work of the Italian Renaissance, and there, perhaps, only by
those “Gates of Paradise” which Ghiberti designed for the Baptister y of
Florence. The oldest existing pieces of Chinese bronze are sacrificial
vessels re- cently discovered in Honan; Chinese scholars assign them to
the Shang Dynasty, but European connoisseurs give them a later, though
uncertain, date. The earliest dated remains are from the period of the
Chou; an ex- cellent example of these is the set of ceremonial vessels
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Most of the Chou bronzes
were confiscated by Shih Huang-ti, lest the people melt them down and
recast them as weapons. With the accumulated metal his artisans made
twelve gigantic statues, each fifty feet high ; 38 but not one foot of
the fifty remains. Under the Han many fine vessels were made, often
inlaid with gold. Artists trained in China cast several masterpieces for
the Temple of Horiuji at Nara in Japan, the loveliest being three
Amida-Buddhas seated in lotus-beds ; 89 there is hardly anything finer
than these figures in the history of bronze.* Under the Sung the art
reached its height, if not of excellence, certainly of fer- tility;
cauldrons, wine vessels, beakers, censers, weapons, mirrors, bells,
drums, vases, plaques and figurines filled the shelves of connoisseurs
and found some place in nearly every home. An attractive sample of Sung
work is an in- cense burner in the form of a water buffalo mounted by
Lao-tze, who be- strides it calmly in proof of the power of philosophy
to tame the savage breast . 40 The casting is throughout of the thinness
of paper, and the lapse of time has given the piece a patina or coating
of mottled green that lends it the meretricious beauty of decay.t Under
the Ming a slow deterioration</p>

<p>t Patina (Latin for dish) is formed by the disintegration of the
metal surface through contact with moisture or earth. It is the fashion
today to value bronzes partly according to the green or black patina
left on them by time — or by the acids used in the modern production of
“ancient” art.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 739</p>
<p>attacked the art; the size of the objects increased, the quality
fell. Bronze, which had been a miraculous novelty in the Chalcolithic
Age of the Em- peror Yii, became a commonplace, and yielded its
popularity to porcelain.</p>
<p>Sculpture was not one of the major arts, not even a fine art, to
the</p>
<p>Chinese . 41 By an act of rare modesty the Far East refused to class
the human body under the rubric of beauty; its sculptors played a little
with drapery, and used the figures of men — seldom of women — to study
or represent certain types of consciousness; but they did not glorify
the body. For the most part they confined their portraits of humanity to
Buddhist saints and Taoist sages, ignoring the -athletes and courtesans
who gave such inspiration to the artists of Greece. In the sculpture of
China animals were preferred even to philosophers and saints.</p>
<p>The earliest Chinese statues known to us are the twelve bronze
colossi erected by Shih Huang- ti; they were melted by a Han ruler to
make “small cash.” A few li ttle animals in bronze remain from the Han
Dynasty; but nearly all the statuary of that epoch was destroyed by war
or the negli- gence of time. The only important Han remains are the
tomb-reliefs found in Shantung; here again the human figures are rare,
the scenes being domi- nated by animals carved in thin relief. More akin
to sculpture are the funerary statuettes of clay — mostly of animals,
occasionally of servants or wives — which were buried with male corpses
as a convenient substitute for suttee. Here and there animals in the
round survive from this period, like the marble tiger, all muscle and
watchfulness, that guarded the temple of Sniang-fu, 42 or the snarling
bears in the Gardner collection at Boston, or the winged and goitrous
lions of the Nanking tombs. 43 These animals, and the proud horses of
the tomb-reliefs, show a mixture of Greco-Bactrian, Assyrian and
Scythian influences; there is nothing about them distinctively Chinese.
44</p>
<p>Meanwhile another influence was entering China, in the form of
Buddhist theology and art. It made a home for itself first in Turkestan,
and built there a civilization from which Stein and Pelliot have
unearthed many tons of ruined statuary; some of it 45 seems equal to
Hindu Buddhist art at its best. The Chinese took over those Buddhist
forms without much alteration, and produced Buddhas as fair as any in
Gandhara or India. The earliest of these appear in the Yiin Kan cave
temples of Shansi (ca. 490 a.d.); among the best are the figures in the
Lung Men grottoes of Honan. Outside these grottoes stand several
colossi, of which the most unique is a graceful Bod- hisattwa , and the
most imposing is the “Vairochana” Buddha (ca. 672 a.d.), destroyed at
the base but still instructively serene. 43 Farther east, in Shan-</p>
<p>74° the story of civilization (chap.xxv</p>
<p>tung, many cave temples have been found whose walls are carved with
mythology in Hindu fashion, with here and there a powerful Bodhisattvoa
like that in the cave of Yun Men (ca. 600 a.d.). 47 The T’ang Dynasty
con - tinued the Buddhist tradition in sculpture, and carried it to
perfection in the seated stone Buddha (ca. 639) found in the province of
Shensi. 48 The later dynasties produced in clay some massive Lohans —
disciples of the gentle Buddha who have the stern faces of financiers;*
and some very beautiful figures of the Mahay ana deity Kuan-yin, almost
in the process of turning from a god into a goddess. 40</p>
<p>After the T’ang Dynasty sculpture lost its religious inspiration, and
took on a secular, occasionally a sensuous, character; moralists
complained, as in Renaissance Italy, that the artists were making saints
as graceful and supple as women; and Buddhist priests laid down severe
iconographic rules for- bidding the individualization of character or
the accentuation of the body. Probably the strong moral bent of the
Chinese impeded the development of sculpture; when the religious motif
lost its impelling force, and the attrac- tiveness of physical beauty
was not allowed to take its place, sculpture in China decayed; religion
destroyed what it could no longer inspire. Towards the end of the T’ang
the fount of sculptural creation began to run dry. The Sung produced
only a few extant pieces of distinction; the Mongols gave their energies
to war; the Mings excelled for a passing moment in bizarreries and such
colossi as the stone monsters that stand before the tombs of the Mings.
Sculpture, choked by religious restrictions, gave up the ghost, and left
the field of Chinese art to porcelain and painting.</p>

structures have been rare in China, even in honoring the gods; old
buildings are seldom found, and only a few pagodas date back beyond the
sixteenth century. Sung architects issued, in 1103 a.d., eight
handsomely illustrated volumes on The Method of Architecture; but the
masterpieces that they pictured</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some examples of this style in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 741</p>
<p>were all of wood, and not a fragment of them survives. Drawings in
the National Library at Paris, purporting to represent the dwellings
and</p>
<p>temples of Confucius’ time, show that through its long history of
over twenty-three centuries Chinese architecture has been content with
the same designs, and the same modest proportions . 60 Perhaps the very
sensi- tivity of the Chinese in matters of art and taste made them
forego struc- tures that might have seemed immodest and grandiose; and
perhaps their superiority in intellect has somewhat hindered the scope
of their imagina- tion. Above all, Chinese architecture suffered from
the absence of three institutions present in almost every other great
nation of antiquity: an hereditary aristocracy, a powerful priesthood ,
51 and a strong and wealthy central government. These are the forces
that in the past have paid for the larger works of art — for the temples
and palaces, the masses and operas, the great frescoes and sculptured
tombs. And China was fortunate and unique: she had none of these
institutions.</p>
<p>For a time the Buddhist faith captured the Chinese soul, and
sufficient of China’s income to build the great temples whose ruins have
been so lately discovered in Turkestan . 53 Buddhist temples of a
certain middling majesty survive throughout China, but they suffer
severely when compared with the religious architecture of India.
Pleasant natural approaches lead to them, usually up winding inclines
marked by ornate gateways called p’ai-lus, and apparently derived from
the “rails” of the Hindu topes; sometimes the entrance is spiritually
barred by hideous images designed, in one sense or another, to frighten
foreign devils away. One of the best of the Chinese Buddhist shrines is
the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha, near the Summer Palace outside
Peking; Fergusson called it “the finest architectural achieve - ment in
China .” 53</p>
<p>More characteristic of the Far East are the pagodas that dominate the
landscape of almost every Chinese town.* Like the Buddhism that inspired
them, these graceful edifices took over some of the superstitions of
popular Taoism, and became centers not only of religious ceremony, but
of geoman tic divination — i.e., the discovery of the future by the
study of lines and clefts in the earth. Communities erected pagodas in
the belief that such structures could ward off wind and flood,
propitiate evil spirits, and attract prosperity. Usually they took the
form of octagonal brick towers rising on a stone foundation to five,
seven, nine or thirteen stories, because even numbers</p>
<ul>
<li>Their origin, in name and fact, is in much dispute. The word may be
taken from the Hindu-Persian term but-kadah — “house of idols”; the form
may be indigenous to China, as some think , 54 or may be derived from
the spire that crowned some Hindu topes . 65</li>
</ul>
<p>74 2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>were unlucky. 88 The oldest standing pagoda is at Sung Yiieh Ssu,
built in 523 a.d. on the sacred mountain of Sung Shan in Honan; one of
the loveliest is the Pagoda of the Summer Palace; the most spectacular
are the Jade Pagoda at Peking and the “Flask Pagoda” at Wu -tai-shan;
the most famous was the Porcelain Tower of Nanking, built in 1412-31,
distinguished by a facing of porcelain over its bricks, and destroyed by
the T’ai - p’ing Rebellion in 1854.</p>
<p>The fairest temples of China are those dedicated to the official
faith at Peking. The Temple of Confucius is guarded by a magnificent
p’ai -lu , most delicately carved, but the temple itself is a monument
to philosophy rather than to art. Built in the thirteenth century, it
has been remodeled and restored many times since. On a wooden stand in
an open niche is the “Tablet of the Soul of the Most Holy Ancestral
Teacher Confucius;” and over the main altar is the dedication to “The
Master and Model of Ten Thousand Generations.” Near the South Tatar Wall
of Peking stand th e Temple of Heaven and the Altar of Heaven. The altar
is an impressive series of marble stairs and terraces, whose number and
arrangement had a magical significance; the temple is a modified pagoda
of three stories, raised upon a marble platform, and built of
unprepossessing brick and tile. Here, at three o’clock in the morning of
the Chinese New Year, the Emperor prayed for the success of his dynasty
and the prosperity of his people, and offered sacrifice to a neuter but,
it was hoped, not neutral, Heaven. How- ever, the temple was badly
damaged by lightning in 1889. 57</p>
<p>More attractive than these stolid shrines are the frail and ornate
palaces that once housed princes and mandarins at Peking. A burst of
architectural genius during the reign of C h’eng Tsu (1403 -25) reared
the Great Hall at the tombs of the Ming Emperors, and raised a medley of
royal residences in an enclosure destined to become known as the
“Forbidden City,” on the very site where Kublai Khan’s palaces had
amazed Marco Polo two centuries before. Ogrish lions stand watch at
either side of the marble balustrades that lead to the marble terrace;
hereon are official buildings with throne rooms, reception rooms,
banquet rooms, and the other needs of royalty; and scattered about are
the elaborate homes in which once lived the Imperial Family, their
children and relatives, their servants and retainers, their eunuchs and
concubines. The palaces hardly vary one from another; all have the same
slender columns, the same pretty lattices, the same carved or lettered
cornices, the same profusion of brilliant colors, the same upward-
curving eaves of the same massively tiled roofs. And like these
forbidden delicacies is the second Summer Palace, some miles away;
perhaps more completely perfect of its kind, more gracefully
proportioned and fastidiously carved, than the once royal homes of
Peking.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 743</p>
<p>If we try to express in brief compass the general characteristics of
Chinese architecture, we find as a first feature the unpleasant wall
that hides the main structures from the street. In the poorer sections
these outer walls are continuous from home to home, and betray an
ancient insecurity of life. Within the wall is a court, upon which open
the doors and lattices of one or several homes. The houses of the poor
are gloomy tenements, with narrow entrances and corridors, low ceilings,
and floors of the good earth; in many families pigs, dogs, hens, men and
women live in one room. The poorest of all live in rain-swept,
wind-beaten huts of mud and straw. Those with slightly better incomes
cover the floor with mats, or pave it with tiles. The well-to-do adorn
the inner court with shrubs and flowers and pools, or surround their
mansions with gar dens in which nature’s wild variety and playful sports
find assiduous representation. Here are no primrose paths, no avenues of
tulip-beds, no squares or circles or octagons of grass or flowers;
instead, precarious footways wind casually through rock-laid gulleys
over devious rivulets, and among trees whose trunks or limbs have been
taught to take strange shapes to satisfy sophisticated souls. Here and
there dainty pavilions, half hidden by the foliage, offer the wanderer
rest.</p>
<p>The home itself is not an imposing affair, even when it is a palace.
It is never more than one story in height; and if many rooms are needed,
the tendency is to raise new edifices rather than to enlarge the old.
Hence a palatial dwelling is seldom one united structure; it is a group
of buildings of which the more important follow in a line from the
entrance to the enclosure, while the secondary buildings are placed at
either side. The favorite materials are wood and brick; stone rarely
rises above the founda- tion terrace; brick is usually confined to the
outer walls, earthen tiles provide the roof, and wood builds the
decorative columns and the inner walls. Above the brightly colored walls
an ornamental cornice runs. Neither the walls nor the columns support
the roof; this, heavy though it is, rests only upon the posts that form
part of the wooden frame. The roof is the major part of a Chinese temple
or home. Built of glazed tiles — yellow if covering imperial heads,
otherwise green, purple, red or blue — the roof makes a pretty picture
in a natural surrounding, and even in the chaos of city streets. Per-
haps the projecting bamboos of ancient tent-tops gave the Far Eastern
roof its graceful upward curve at the eaves; but more probably this
celebrated form arose merely from the desire of the Chinese builder to
protect his structure from rain.“ For there were few windows in China;
Korean paper or pretty lattices took their place, and lattices would not
keep out the rain.</p>
<p>The main doorway is not at the gable end, but on the southern facade;
within the ornamented portal is usually a screen or wall, barring the
visitor from an immediate view of the interior, and offering some
discouragement</p>
<p>744 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>to evil spirits, who must travel in a straight line. The hall and
rooms are dim, for most of the daylight is kept out by the latticed
openings and the pro- jecting eaves. There are seldom any arrangements
for ventilation, and the only heat supplied is from portable braziers,
or brick beds built over a smoky fire; there are no chimneys and no
flues . 50 Rich and poor suffer from cold, and go to bed fully clothed .
60 “Are you cold?” the traveler asks the Chinese; and the answer is
often “Of course .” 61 The ceiling may be hung with gaudy paper
lanterns; the walls may be adorned with calligraphic scrolls, or ink
sketches, or silk hangings skilfully embroidered and painted with rural
scenes. The furniture is usually of heavy wood, stained to an ebony
black, and luxuriantly carved; the lighter pieces may be of brilliant
lacquer. The Chinese are the only Oriental nation that sits on chairs;
and even they prefer to recline or squat. On a special table or shelf
are the vessels used to offer sacrifice to the ancestral dead. In the
rear are the apart- ments of the women. Separate rooms or detached
buildings may house a library or a school.</p>
<p>The general impression left by Chinese architecture upon the foreign
and untechnical observer is one of charming frailty. Color dominates
form, and beauty here has to do without the aid of sublimity. The
Chinese temple or palace seeks not to dominate nature, but to cooperate
with it in that perfect harmony of the whole which depends upon the
modesty of the parts. Those qualities that give a structure strength,
security and permanence are absent here, as if the builders feared that
earthquakes would stultify their pains. These buildings hardly belong to
the same art as that which raised its monu- ments at Kamak and
Persepolis, and on the Acropolis; they are not architec- ture as we of
the Occident have known it, but rather the carving of wood, the glazing
of pottery and the sculpture of stone; they harmonize better with
porcelain and jade than with the ponderous edifices that a mixture of
engineering and architecture gave to India, Mesopotamia or Rome. If we
do not ask of them the grandeur and the solidity which their makers may
never have cared to give them, if we accept them willingly as
architectural cameos expressing the most delicate of tastes in the most
fragile of structural forms, then they take their place as a natural and
appropriate variety of Chinese art, and among the most gracious shapes
ever fashioned by men.</p>

<p>The Occident has been forgivably slow in acquainting itself with</p>
<p>Chinese painting, for almost every aspect and method of the art in
the East differed from its practice in the West. First, the paintings of
the Far East were never on canvas; occasionally they were wall frescoes,
as in the period of Buddhist influence; sometimes, as in later days,
they were on paper; but for the most part they were on silk, and the
frailty of this material shortened the life of every masterpiece, and
left the history of the art with mere memories and records of
accomplishment. Further, the paintings had an air of thinness and
slightness; most of them were in water-color, and lacked the full-bodied
and sensuous tints of European pictures in oil. The Chinese tried
oil-painting, but seem to have abandoned it as too coarse and heavy a
method for their subtle purposes. To them painting, at least in its
earliest forms, was a branch of calligraphy, or beautiful penmanship;
the brush which they used for writing served them also for painting; and
many of their chef - d’’ oeuvres were drawn simply with brush and ink.*
Finally, their greatest achievements were uncon- sciously hidden from
Western travelers. For the Chinese do not flaunt their pictures on
public or private walls; they roll them up and store them carefully
away, and unfold them for occasional enjoyment as we take down and read
a book. Such scroll paintings were arranged in sequence on a roll of
paper or silk, and were “read” like a manuscript; smaller</p>
<p>pictures were hung on a wall, but were seldom framed; sometimes a
series</p>

writing is in its origin a form of drawing or painting, the Chinese
classify painting as a form of writing, and consider calligraphy, or
beautiful writing, as a major art. Specimens of fine writing are hung on
the walls in Chinese and Japanese homes; and devotees of the art have
pursued its masterpieces as modern collectors roam over conti- nents to
find a picture or a vase. The most famous of Chinese calligraphers was
Wang Hsi-chih (ca. 400 a.d.); it was on the Chinese characters as formed
by his graceful hand that the characters were cut when block- printing
began. The great T’ang emperor, T’ai Tsung, resorted to theft to get
from Pien-tsai a scroll written by Wang Hsi-chih. There- upon Pien-tsai,
we are told, lost appetite and died. 83</h1>
<p>74^ THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>of pictures was painted on a screen. By the time of the later Sung
Dynasty the art of painting had already developed thirteen “branches,”
03 and innumerable forms.</p>
<p>Painting is mentioned in Chinese literature as an established art
several centuries before Christ; and despite the interruptions of war it
has con- tinued in China to our own time. Tradition makes the first
Chinese painter a woman, Lei, sister of the p ious Emperor Shun; “alas,”
cried a disgusted critic, “that this divine art should have been
invented by a woman!” 04 Nothing survives of Chou painting; but that the
art was then already old appears from Confucius’ report of how deeply he
was affected by the frescoes in the Grand Temple at Lo-yang. 05 During
the early years of the Han Dynasty a writer complained that a hero whom
he admired had not been sufficiently painted: “Good artists are many;
why does not one of them draw him?” 06 The story is to ld of an artist
virtuoso of the time, Lieh-I, who could draw a perfectly straight line
one thousand feet long, could etch a detailed map of China on a square
inch of surface, and could fill his mouth with colored water and spit it
out in the form of paintings; the phoenixes which he painted were so
lifelike that people wondered why they did not fly away.” There are
signs that Chinese</p>
<p>painting reached one of its zeniths at the beginning of our era, 08
but war and time have destroyed the evidence. From the days when the
Ch’in warriors sacked Lo-yang (ca. 249 b.c.), burning whatever they
could not use, down to the Boxer Uprising (1900 a.d.), when the soldiers
of Tung Cho employed the silk pictures of the Imperial Collection for
wrapping purposes, the victories of art and war have alternated in their
ancient conflict — destruction always certain, but creation never
still.</p>
<p>As Christianity transformed Mediterranean culture and art in the
third and fourth centuries after Christ, so Buddhism, in the same
centuries, effected a theological and esthetic revolution in the life of
China. While Confucianism retained its political power, Buddhism,
mingling with</p>
<p>Taoism, became the dominating force in art, and brought to the
Chinese a stimulating contact with Hindu motives, symbols, methods and
forms. The greatest genius of the Chinese Buddhist school of painting
was Ku K’ai -chih, a man of such unique and positive personality that a
web of anecdote or legend has meshed him in. He loved the girl next
door, and offered her his hand; but she, not knowing how famous he was
to be, refused him. He painted her form upon a wall, and stuck a thorn
into the heart, whereupon the girl began to die. He approached her
again, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 747</p>
<p>she yielded; he removed the thorn from his picture, and forthwith the
girl grew well. When the Buddhists tried to raise money to build a</p>
<p>temple at Nanking he promised the fund one million “cash”; all China
laughed at the offer, for Ku was as poor as an artist. “Give me the use
of a wall,” he asked. Having found a wall and secured privacy, he
painted there the Buddhist saint Uimala-Kirti. When it was finished he
sent for the priests, and explained to them how they might raise the
million “cash.” “On the first day you must charge 100,000 ‘cash’ for
admission” to see the picture; “on the second day, 50,000; on the third
day let visitors sub - scribe what they please.” They did as he told
them, and took in a million “cash.” 68 Ku painted a long seri es of
Buddhist pictures, and many Others, but nothing certainly his has come
down to our day.* He wrote three treatises on painting, of which some
fragments survive. Men, he said, were the most difficult things to
paint; next came landscapes, then horses and gods.’ 2 He insisted on
being a philosopher, too; under his portrait of the emperor he wrote:
“In Nature there is nothing high which is not soon brought low. . . .
When the sun has reached its noon, it begins to sink; when the moon is
full it begins to wane. To rise to glory is as hard as to build a
mountain out of grains of dust; to fall into calamity is as easy as the
rebound of a tense spring.” 78 His contemporaries ranked him as the
outstanding man of his time in three lines: in painting, in wit, and in
fool- ishness.’*</p>
<p>Painting flourished at the T’ang court. “There are as many painters
as morning stars,” said Tu Fu, “but artists are few.’”’ In the ninth
century Chang Yen-yuan wrote a book called Eminent Painters of All Ages
, in which he described the work of three hundred and seventy artists. A
pic- ture by a master, he tells us, brought in those days as much as
twenty thousand ounces of silver. But he warns us against rating art in
monetary terms; “good pictures,” he writes, “are more priceless than
gold or jade; bad ones are not worth a potsherd.”™ Of T’ang painters we
still know the names of two hundred and twenty; of their work hardly
anything remains, for the Tatar revolutionists who sacked Chang-an in
756 a.d. did not care for painting. We catch something of the art
atmosphere that mingled with the poetry of the time, in the story of Han
Yii, the famous</p>

<p>“Prince of Literature.” One day he won, from a fellow lodger at an
inn, a precious miniature portraying, in the smallest compass, one
hundred and twenty-three human figures, eighty-three horses, thirty
other animals, three chariots, and two hundred and fifty- one articles.
“I thought a great deal of it, for I could not believe that it was the
work of a single man, uniting as it did in itself such a variety of
excellences; and no sum would have tempted me to part from it. Next year
I left the city, and went to Ho-yang; and there, one day, while
discussing art with strangers, I pro- duced the picture for them to see.
Among them was a Mr. Chao, a</p>
<p>Censor,* a highly cultivated man, who, when he saw it, seemed rather
overcome, and at length said: ‘That pict ure is a copy, made by me in my
youth, of a work from the Imperial Gallery. I lost it twenty years ago
while traveling in the province of Fukien.’ ” Han Yvi at once presented
the miniature to Mr. Chao.</p>
<p>Just as in Chinese religion two schools had taken shape, Confucian
and Taoist-Buddhist — and just as two schools, led by Chu Hsi and Wang
Yang-ming, were soon to develop in philosophy, representing respectively
what we in the West would call the classic and the romantic types of
mind; so in Chinese painting the northern artists accepted a stern
tradi- tion of classical sobriety and restraint, while the south gave
color and form to feeling and imagination. The northern school set
itself severely to secure correct modeling of figure and full clarity of
line; the southern rebelled like Montmartre against such limitations,
disdained a simple real- ism, and tried to use objects merely as
elements in a spiritual experience, tones in a musical mood.” Li Ssu
-hsiin, painting at the court of Ming Huang, fo und time, amid the
fluctuations of political power and lonely” exile, to establish the
northern school. He painted some of the first Chinese landscapes, and
achieved a degree of realism carried down in many a tale; the Emperor
said he could hear, at night, the splash of the water that Li had
painted upon an imperial screen; and a fish leaped to life out of an-
other of his pictures and was later found in a pool — every nation tells
such stories of its painters. The southern school sprouted out of the
natural innovations of art, and the genius of Wang Wei; in his
impressionist style a landscape became merely the symbol of a mood. A
poet as well as a painter, Wang sought to bind the two arts by making
the picture express a poem; it was of him that men first used the now
trite phrase so applicable</p>
<p>Cf. p. 798 below.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>749</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>to nearly all Chinese poetry and painting: “Every poem is a picture,
and every picture is a poem.” (In many cases the poem is inscribed upon
the picture, and is itself a calligraphic work of art.) Tung Ch’i -
ch’ang, we</p>
<p>are told, spent his whole life searching for a genuine Wang
Wei.”*</p>
<p>The greatest painter of the T’ang epoch, and, by common consent, of
all the Far East, rose above distinctions of school, and belonged rather
to the Buddhist tradition of Chinese art. Wu Tao-tze deserved his name —
Wu, Master of the Tao or Way, for all those impressions and formless&gt;
thoughts which Lao-tze and Chuang-tze had found too subtle for words se
emed to flow naturally into line and color under his brush. “A poverty -
stricken orphan,” a Chinese historian describes him, “but endowed with a
divine nature, he had not assumed the cap of puberty ere he was already
a master artist, and had flooded Lo- yang with his works.” Chinese tradi
- tion has it that he was fond of wine and feats of strength, and
thought like Poe that the spirit could work best under a little
intoxication . 81 He ex- celled in every subject: men, gods, devils,
Buddhas, birds, beasts, buildings, landscapes — all seemed to come
naturally to his exuberant art. He painted with equal skill on silk,
paper, and freshly-plastered walls; he made three hundred frescoes for
Buddhist edifices, and one of these, containing more than a thous and
figures, became as famous in China as “The Last Judg - ment” or “The
Last Supper” in Europe. Ninety -three of his paintings were in the
Imperial Gallery in the twelfth century, four hundred years after his
death; but none remains anywhere today. His Buddhas, we are told,
“fathomed the mysteries of life and death”; his picture of purgatory
frightened some of the butchers and fishmongers of China into abandoning
their scandalously ’ un-Buddhistic trades; his representation of Ming
Huang’s dream convi nced the Emperor that Wu had had an identical vision
. 88 When the monarch sent Wu to sketch the scenery along the Chia-ling
River in Szechuan he was piqued to see the artist return without having
sketched a line. “I have it all in my heart,” said Wu; a nd isolating
himself in a room of the palace, he threw off, we are assured, a hundred
miles of landscape. 88 ! When General Pei wished his portrait painted,
Wu asked him not to pose, but to do a sword dance; after which the
artist painted a picture that contemporaries felt constrained to ascribe
to divine</p>

<p>75° THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>inspiration. So great was his reputation that when he was finishing
some Buddhist figures at the Hsing- shan Temple, “the whole of Chang-
an” came to see him add the finishing touches. Surrounded by this
assemblage, says a Chinese historian of the ninth century, “he executed
the haloes with so violent a rush and swirl that it seemed as though a
whirlwind possessed his hand, and all who saw it cried that some god was
helping him”: 85 the lazy will always attribute genius to some
“inspiration” that comes for mere waiting. When Wu had lived long
enough, says a pretty tale, he painted a vast landscape, stepped into
the mouth of a cave pictured in it, and was never seen again . 80 Never
had art known such mastery and delicacy of line.</p>
<p>Under the Sung emperors painting became a passion with the Chinese.
Emancipating itself from subserviency to Buddhist themes, it poured
forth an unprecedented number and variety of pictures. The Sung Em-
peror Hui Tsung was himself not the least of the eight hundred known
painters of the day. In a roll which is one of the treasures of the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston he portrayed with astonishing simplicity
and clarity the stages through which women carried the preparation of
silk ; 87 he founded an art museum richer in masterpieces than any
collection that China has ever again known ; 88 he elevated the Painting
Academy from a mere department of the Literary College into an
independent institution of the highest rank, substituted art tests for
some of the literary exercises traditionally used in the examinations
for political office, and raised men to the ministry for their
excellence in art as often as for their skill in states- manship . 88
The Tatars, hearing of all this, invaded China, deposed the Emperor,
sacked the capital and destroyed nearly all of the paintings in the
Imperial Museum, whose catalogue had filled twenty volumes . 90 The
artist-emperor was carried away by the invaders, and died in captivity
and disgrace.</p>
<p>Greater than this royal painter were Kuo Hsi and Li Lung- mien.
“For</p>
<p>tall pines, huge trees, swirling streams, beetling crags, steep
precipices, mountain peaks, now lovely in the rising mist, now lost in
an obscuring pall, with all their thousand ten thousand shapes — critics
allow that Kuo Hsi strode across his generation .”* 01 Li Lung -mien was
an artist, a scholar, a successful official and a gentleman, honored by
the Chinese as the per- fect type of Chinese culture at its richest. He
passed from the profession</p>

uncertainly attributed to Kuo Hsi. 02</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 751</p>
<p>of calligraphy to sketching and painting, and rarely used anything
but ink; he gloried in the strict traditions of the Northern School, and
spent himself upon accuracy and delicacy of line. He painted horses so
Well that when six that he had painted died, it was charged that his
picture had stolen their vital principle from them. A Buddhist priest
warned him that he would become a horse if he painted horses so often
and so intently; he accepted the counsel of the monk, and painted five
hundred Lohans. We may judge of his repute by the fact that Hui Tsung’s
imperial gallery, when it was sacked, contained one hundred and seven
works by Li</p>
<p>Lung-mien.</p>
<p>Other masters crowded the Sung scene: Mi Fei, an eccentric genius</p>
<p>who was forever washing his hands or changing his clothes when he was
not collecting old masters or transforming landscape painting with his
“method of blobs”— daubs of ink laid on without the guidance of any con-
tour line;* Hsia Kuei, whose long roll of scenes from the Yang-tze — its
modest sources, its passage through loess and gorges, its gaping mouth
filled with merchant ships and sampans — has led many students 03 to
rank him at the head of all landscape painters of Orient and Occident;
Ma Yuan, whose delicate landscapes and distant vistas adorn the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts;f Liang K’ai, with his stately portrait of Li Po; Mu
- ch’i, with his terrible tiger, his careless starling, and his morose
but gentle Kuan-yin; and others whose names strike no familiar chords in
Occidental memories, but are the tokens of a mind rich in the heritage
of the East. “The Sung culture,” says Fenollosa, “was the ripest
expression of Chinese genius .” 00</p>
<p>When we try to estimate the quality of Chinese painting in the heyday
of T’ang and Sung we are in the position of future historians who may
try to write of the Italian Renaissance when all the works of Raphael,
Leo- nardo and Michelangelo have been lost. After the ravages of
barbaric hosts had destroyed the masterpieces of Chinese painting, and
interrupted for centuries the continuity of Chinese development,
painting seems to have lost heart; and though the later dynasties,
native and alien, produced many artists of delicacy or power, none could
rank with the men who had known paradise for a time at the courts of
Ming Huang and Hui *A landscape attributed to Mi Fei may be seen in Room
E u of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>t Particularly striking is “The Lady Ling - chao Standing in the
Snow.” The Lady (a Buddhist mystic of the eighth century) is quite still
in meditation, like Socrates in the snow at Platasa. The world (the
artist seems to say) is nothing except to a mind; and that mind can
ignore it — for a while.</p>

<p>Tsung. When we think of the Chinese we must see them not merely as a
people now stricken with poverty, weakened with corruption, tom with
factions and disgraced with defeat, but as a nation that has had, in the
long vista of its history, ages that could compare with those of
Pericles, Augustus and the Medici, and may have such ages again.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Qualities of Chinese Fainting</li>
</ol>
<p>The rejection of perspective — Of realism — Line as nobler than</p>
<p>color — Form as rhythm — Representation by suggestion —</p>
<p>Conventions and restrictions — Sincerity of Chinese art</p>
<p>What is it that distinguishes Chinese painting, and makes it so
completely different from every other school of painting in history
except its own pupils in Japan? First, of course, its scroll or screen
form. But this is an external matter; far more intrinsic and fundamental
is the Chinese scorn of perspective and shadow. When two European
painters accepted the invita- tion of the Emperor K’ang -hsi to come and
paint decorations for his palaces, their work was rejected because they
had made the farther columns in their pictures shorter than the nearer
ones; nothing could be more false and artificial, argued the Chinese,
than to represent distances where obviously there were none . 00 Neither
party could understand the prejudice of the other, for the Europeans had
been taught to look at a scene from a level with it, while the Chinese
artists were accustomed to visualize it as seen from above . 07 Shadows,
too, seemed to the Chinese to be out of place in a form of art which, as
they understod it, aimed not to imitate reality, but to give pleasure,
convey moods, and suggest ideas through the medium of per- fect
form.</p>
<p>The form was everything in these paintings, and it was sought not in
warmth or splendor of color, but in rhythm and accuracy of line. In the
early paintings color was sternly excluded, and in the masters it was
rare; black ink and a brush were enough, for a color had nothing to do
with form. Form, as the artist-theorist Hsieh Ho said, is rhythm: first
in the sense that a Chinese painting is the visible record of a rhythmic
gesture, a dance executed by the hand ; 08 and again in the sense that a
significant form reveals the “rhythm of the spirit,’’ the essence and
quiet movement of reality . 00 Finally, the body of rhythm is line — not
as describing the actual contours of things, but as building forms that,
through suggestion or symbol, express the soul. The skill of execution,
as distinct from the power of per- ception, feeling and imagination,
lies — in Chinese painting — almost entirely in</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 753</p>
<p>accuracy and delicacy of line. The painter must observe with patient
care, possess intense feeling under strict control, conceive his purpose
clearly, and then, without the possibility of correction, transfer to
the silk, with a few continuous and easeful strokes, his representative
imagination. The art of line reached its apex in China and Japan, as the
art of color touched its zenith in Venice and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Chinese painting never cared for realism, but sought rather to
suggest than to describe; it left “truth” to science, and gave itself to
beauty. A branch emerging nowhence, and bearing a few leaves or blossoms
against a clear sky, was sufficient subject for the greatest master; his
handling and proportion of the empty background were tests of his
courage and his skill. One of the subjects proposed to candidates for
admission to Hui Tsung’s Painting Academy may serve to illustrate the
Chinese emphasis on indirect suggestion as against explicit
representation: the contestants were asked to illustrate by paintings a
line of poetry — “The hoof of his steed comes back heavily charged with
the scent of the trampled flowers.” The successful competitor was an
artist who painted a rider with a cluster of butterflies following at
the horse’s heels.</p>
<p>As the form was everything, the subject might be anything. Men were
rarely the center or essence of the picture; when they appeared they
were almost always old, and nearly all alike. The Chinese painter,
though he was never visibly a pessimist, seldom looked at the world
through the eyes of youth. Portraits were painted, but indifferently
well; the artist was not interested in individuals. He loved flowers and
animals, apparently, far more than men, and spent himself upon them
recklessly; Hui Tsung, with an empire at his command, gave half his life
to painting birds and flowers. Sometimes the flowers or the animals were
symbols, like the lotus or the dragon; but for the* most part they were
drawn for their own sake, because the charm and mystery of life appeared
as completely in them as in a man. The horse was especially loved, and
artists like Han Kan did hardly any- thing else but paint one form after
another of that living embodiment of artistic line.</p>
<p>It is true that painting suffered in China, first from religious
conventions, and then from academic restrictions; that the copying and
imitation of old masters became a’ retarding fetich in the t raining of
students, and that the artist was in many matters confined to a given
number of permitted ways of fashioning his material . 100 “In my young
days,” said an eminent Sung critic, “I praised the master whose pictures
I liked; but as my judgment matured I praised myself for liking what the
masters had chosen to have me like .” 101 It is astonishing how much
vitality remained in this art despite its conventions and canons; it was
here as Hume thought it had been with</p>
<p>754 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>the censored writers of the French Enlightenment: the very
limitations from which the artist suffered compelled him to be
brilliant.</p>
<p>What saved the Chinese painters from stagnation was the sincerity of
their feeling for nature. Taoism had taught it to them, and Buddhism had
made it stronger by teaching them that man and nature are one in the
flow and change and unity of life. As the poets found in nature a
retreat from urban strife, and the philosophers sought in it a model of
morals and a guide to life, so the painters brooded by solitary streams,
and lost themselves in deeply wooded hills, feeling that in these
speechless and lasting things the nameless spirit had expressed itself
more clearly than in the turbulent career and thought of men.* Nature,
which is so cruel in China, lavishing death with cold and flood, was
accepted stoically as the supreme god of the Chinese, and received from
them not merely religious sacrifice, but the worship of their
philosophy, their literature and their art. Let it serve as an
indication of the age and depth of culture in China that a thousand
years before Claude Lorraine, Rousseau, Wordsworth and Chateaubriand the
Chinese made nature a passion, and created a school of landscape
painting whose work throughout the Far East became one of the sovereign
expressions of mankind.</p>

<p>As we approach the most distinct art of China, in which her
leadership of the world is least open to dispute, we find ourselves
harassed by our tendency to class pottery as an industry. To us,
accustomed to think of “china” in terms of the kitchen, a pottery is a
place where “china” is made; it is a factory like any other, and its
products do not arouse exalted asso- ciations. But to the Chinese,
pottery was a major art; it pleased their prac- tical and yet esthetic
souls by combining beauty with use; it gave to their greatest national
institution — the drinking of tea — utensils as lovely to the
finger-tips as to the eye; and it adorned their homes with shapes so
fair that even the poorest families might live in the presence of
perfection. Pottery is the sculpture of the Chinese.</p>
<p>Pottery is, first, the industry that bakes clay into usable forms,
second, the art that makes those forms beautiful, and third, the objects
produced</p>

<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 755</p>
<p>by that industry and that art. Porcelain is vitrified pottery; that
is, it</p>
<p>is clay so mixed with minerals that when exposed to fire it melts or
fuses into a translucent, but not transparent, substance resembling
glass.* The Chinese made porcelain out of two minerals chiefly: kaolin —
a pure white clay formed from decomposed felspar of granite, and
pe-tun-tse — a fusible white quartz that gave the product its
translucency. These materials were ground into a powder, worked up into
a paste with water, moulded by hand or on the wheel, and subjected to
high temperatures that fused the composi- tion into a vitreous form,
brilliant and durable. Sometimes the potters, not content with this
simpl e white porcelain, covered the “paste”— i.e., the vessel formed
but not yet fired — with a “glaze” or coating of fine glass, and then
placed the vessel in the kiln; sometimes they applied the glaze after
baking the paste into a “biscuit,” and then placed the vessel over the
fire again. Usually the glaze was colored; but in many cases the paste
was painted in color before applying a transparent glaze, or colors were
painted on the fired glaze and fused upon it by re- firing. These “over
- glaze” colors, wh ich we call enamels, were made of colored glass
ground to powder and reduced to a liquid applicable with the painter’s
slender brush. Life -trained specialists painted the flowers, others the
animals, others the landscapes, others the saints or sages who meditated
among the mountains or rode upon strange beasts over the waves of the
sea.</p>
<p>Chinese pottery is as old as the Stone Age; Professor Andersson has
found pottery, in Honan and Kansu, which “can hardly be later in time
than 3000 b . c .”; 103 an d the excellent form and finish of these
vases assure us that even at this early date the industry had long since
become an art. Some of the pieces resemble the pottery of Anau, and
suggest a western origin for Chinese civilization. Far inferior to these
neolithic products are the fragments of funerary pottery unearthed in
Ftonan and ascribed to the declining years of the Shang Dynasty. No
remains of artistic value appear again before the Han, when we find not
only pottery, but the first known use of glass in the Far East.t Under
the T’ang emperors the growing popularity of tea provided a creative
stimulus for the ceramic art; genius or accident revealed, about the
ninth century, the possibility of producing a vessel vitri- fied not
only on the glazed surface (as under the Han and in other civiliza-
tions before this age) but throughout — i.e., true porcelain. In that
century</p>

<p>75&lt;S THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>a Moslem traveler, Suleiman, reported to his countrymen: “They have
in China a very fine clay with which they make vases as transparent as
glass; water is seen throu gh them.” Excavations have recently
discovered, on a ninth-century site at Samarra on the Tigris, pieces of
porcelain of Chinese manufacture. The next recorded appearance of the
substance outside of China was about 1171, when Saladin sent forty-one
pieces of porcelain as a precious gift to the Sultan of Damascus. 1 ®
The manufacture of porcelain is not known to have begun in Europe before
1470; it is mentioned then as an art which the Venetians had learned
from the Arabs in the course of the Crusades. 1 ®</p>
<p>Sung was the classic period of Chinese porcelain. Ceramists ascribe
to it both the oldest extant wares and the best; even the Ming potters
of a later age, who sometimes equaled them, spoke of Sung pottery in
rever- ential terms, and collectors treasured its masterpieces as beyond
any price. The great factories at Ching-te-chen, founded in the sixth
century near rich deposits of the minerals used for making and coloring
earthenware, were officially recognized by the imperial court, and began
to pour out upon China an unprecedented stream of porcelain plates,
cups, bowls, vases, beakers, jars, bottles, ewers, boxes, chess-boards,
candlesticks, maps, even enameled and gold-inlaid porcelain hat- racks.
1 ” Now for the first time appeared those jade-green pieces known as
celadon* which it has long been the highest ambition of the modern
potter to produce, and of the collector to acquire.! Specimens of it
were sent to Lorenzo de’ Medici by the Sultan of Egypt in 1487. The
Persians and the Turks valued it not only for its incredibly smooth
texture and rich lustre, but as a detector of poisons; the vessels would
change color, they believed, whenever poisonous substances were placed
in them. 1 ® Pieces of celadon are handed down from generation to
generation as priceless heirlooms in the families of connoisseurs.
110</p>
<p>For almost three hundred years the workers of the Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>labored to keep the art of porcelain on the high level to which the
Sung potters had raised it, and they did not fall far short of success.

<p>fFrom the Occidental point of view the one is as hard as the other;

<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 757</p>
<p>dred kilns burned at Ching-te-chen, and the imperial court alone used
96,000 pieces of chinaware to adorn its gardens, its tables and its
rooms. 111 Now appeared the first good enamels — colors fired over the
glaze. Yel- low monochromes and “egg - shell” blue and white porcelains
reached per - fection; the blue and white silver-mounted cup named from
the Emperor Wan- li (or Shen Tsung) is one of the world’s masterpieces
of the potter’s art. Among the experts of the Wan-li age was Hao
Shih-chiu, who could make wine-cups weighing less than one forty-eighth
of an ounce. One day, says a Chinese historian, Hao called at the home
of a high official and begged permission to examine a porcelain tripod
owned by the statesman, and numbered among the choicest of Sung wares.
Hao felt the tripod carefully with his hands, and secretly copied the
form of its design on a paper concealed in his sleeve. Six months later
he visited the official again, and said: “Your Excellency is the pos
sessor of a tripod censer of white Ting- yao .* Here is a similar one of
mine.” Tang, the official, compared the new tripod with his own, and
could detect no difference; even the stand and cover of the tripod
fitted Hao’s completely. Hao smilingly</p>
<p>admitted that his own piece was an imitation, and then sold it for
sixty pieces of silver to Tang, who sold it for fifteen hundred. 113</p>
<p>It was under the Mings that Chinese cloisonne attained its highest
ex- cellence. Both the word and the art came from outside: the word from
the French cloison (partition), the art from the Near East of Byzantine
days; the Chinese referred to its products occasionally as Kuei kuo yao
— wares of the devils’ country . 113 The art consists in cutting narrow
strips of copper, s ilver or gold, soldering them edgewise upon the
lines of a design previously drawn upon a metal object, filling the
spaces between the cloisons (or wire lines) with appropriately colored
enamel, exposing the vessel repeatedly to fire, grinding the hardened
surface with pumice stone, polishing it with charcoal, and gilding the
visible edges of the cloisons . The earliest known Chinese ex- amples
are some mirrors imported into Nara, Japan, about the middle of the
eighth century. The oldest wares definitely marked belong to the end of
the Mongol or Yuan Dynasty; the best, to the reign of the Ming Emperor
Ching Ti. The last great period of Chinese cloisonne was under the great
Manchu emperors of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The factories at Ching-te-chen were destroyed in the wars that ended
the Ming Dynasty, and were not revived again until the accession of
one</p>

porcelain.</p>
<p>758 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>of China’s most enlightened rulers, K’ang -hsi, who, quite as much as
his contemporary Louis XIV, was every inch a king. The factories at
Ching- te-chen were rebuilt under his direction, and soon three thousand
furnaces were in operation. Never had China, or any other country, seen
such an abundance of elegant pottery. The Kang-hsi workers thought their
wares inferior to those of Ming, but modern connoisseurs do not agree
with them. Old forms were imitated perfectly, and new forms were
developed in rich diversity. By coating a paste with a glaze of a
different tempo of fusibility the Manchu potters produced the prickly
surface of “crackle”</p>
<p>The last great age of Chinese porcelain came in the long and
prosperous reign of Ch’ien Lung. Fertility was undiminished; and though
the new forms had something less than the success of the K’ang -hsi
innovations, the skill of the master-potters was still supreme. The
Famille Rose attained its fullest perfection, and spread half the
flowers and fruits of nature over the most brilliant glaze, while
egg-shell porcelain provided costly lamp- shades for extravagant
millionaires.” 4 Then, through fifteen bloody years (1850- 64), came the
T’ai - p’ing Rebellion, ruining fifteen provinces, de - stroying six
hundred cities, killing twenty million men and women, and</p>

<p>CHAP. XXV) THE AGE OF THE ARTISTS 759</p>
<p>so impoverishing the Manchu Dynasty that it withdrew its support from
the potteries, and allowed them to close their doors and scatter their
crafts- men into a disordered world.</p>
<p>The art of porcelain, in China, has not recovered from that
devasta-</p>
<p>tion, and perhaps it never will. For other factors have reinforced
the destructiveness of war and the ending of imperial patronage. The
growth of the export trade tempted the artists to design such pieces as
best satis- fied the taste of European buyers, and as that taste was not
as fine as the Chinese, the bad pieces drove the good pieces out of
circulation by a ceramic variation of Gresham’s law. About the year 1840
English fac - tories began to make inferior porcelain at Canton,
exported it to Europe, and gave it the name of “chinaware”; factories at
Sevres in France, Meis - sen in Germany, and Burslem in England imitated
the work of the Chin- ese, lowered the cost of production by installing
machinery, and captured yearly more and more of China’s foreign ceramic
trade.</p>
<p>What survives is the memory of an art perhaps as completely lost as
that of medieval stained glass; try as they will, the potters of Europe
have been unable to equal the subtler forms of Chinese porcelain. Con-
noisseurs raise with every decade their monetary estimate of the master-
pieces that survive; they ask five hundred dollars for a tea-cup, and
receive 3,600 for a hawthorn vase; as far back as 1767 two “turquoise”
porce - lain “Dogs of Fo,” at auction, brought five times as much as
Guido Reni’s “Infant Jesus,” and thrice as much as Raphael’s “Holy
Family.” 116 But any one who has felt, with eyes and fingers and every
nerve, the loveli- ness of Chinese porcelain will resent these
valuations, and count them as sacrilege; the world of beauty and the
world of money never touch, even when beautiful things are sold. It is
enough to say that Chinese porcelain is the summit and symbol of Chinese
civilization, one of the noblest</p>
<p>things that men have done to make their species forgivable on the
earth.</p>
