<li>grattan’s Ireland</li>
</ol>
<p>AN English traveler, visiting Ireland in 1764, explained why the poor
jf_were taking to crime:</p>
<p>What dread of justice or punishment can be expected from an Irish
peasant in a state of wretchedness and extreme penury, in which, if the
first man that met him were to knock him on the head and give him an
everlasting relief from his distressed and penurious life, he might have
reason to think it a friendly and meritorious action?… That many of them
bear their… abject state with patience is to me a sufficient proof of
the natural civility of their disposition. 1</p>
<p>The landlords, who were almost all Protestants, were not the direct
or most brutal oppressors of the peasants, who were almost all
Catholics; usu- ally the owners lived in England and did not see the
blood on the rents exacted by the middlemen to whom they leased their
land; it was the middle- men who drew every possible penny from the
peasants, until these had to feed on potatoes and dress in rags.</p>
<p>In 1758, because disease was decimating cattle in England, Ireland
was allowed for five years to export livestock to Britain. Many acres in
Ireland — including common lands formerly used by the tenant farmers —
were changed from tillage to grazing or pasturage; the rich were
enriched, the poor were further impoverished. They added to their
problems by marrying early — “upon the first capacity,” as Sir William
Petty put it; 2 presumably they hoped that children would soon earn
their keep and then help pay the rent. So, despite a high death rate,
the population of Ireland grew from 3,191,000 in 1754 to 4,753,000 in
1791. 3</p>
<p>The industrial picture was brightening. Many Protestants and some
Cath- olics had gone into the production of linens, woolens, cotton
goods, silk, or glass. In the final quarter of the century, after
Grattan had secured a moder- ation of British restrictions on Irish
manufactures and commerce, a middle class developed which provided
economic leverage for liberal politics and cultural growth. Dublin
became one of the leading centers of education, mu- sic, drama, and
architecture in the British Isles. Trinity College was becoming a
university, and already had a long roster of distinguished graduates. If
Ireland had kept her shining lights at home — Burke, Goldsmith, and
Sheri- dan as well as Swift and Berkeley — she would have shone with the
most brilliant nations of the age. After 1766 the lord lieutenant made
Dublin his permanent home instead of paying brief visits once a year.
Now majestic</p>

<p>7 &lt; 5 o ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>public buildings rose, and elegant mansions. Dublin’s theaters
rivaled Lon - don’s in the excellence of their productions; here
Handel’s Messiah received</p>
<p>Religion, of course, was the pervading issue in Ireland. Dissenters —
i.e., Presbyterians, Independents (Puritans), and Baptists — were
excluded from office and from Parliament by the Test Act, which required
reception of the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite as a
precondition to eligibility. The Toleration Act of 1689 was not extended
to Ireland. The Presbyterians of Ulster protested in vain against these
disabilities; thousands of them emi- grated to America, where many of
them fought devotedly in the Revolu- tionary armies.</p>
<p>The population of Ireland was eighty per cent Catholic, but no
Catholic could be elected to Parliament. Only a few Catholics owned
land. Protestant tenants were given leases for their lives, Catholic
tenants for no more than thirty-one years; and they had to pay two
thirds of their profits as rent. 4 No Catholic schools were allowed, but
the authorities did not enforce the law forbidding the Irish to seek
education abroad. Some Catholic students were admitted to Trinity
College, but they could not receive a degree. Cath- olic worship was
permitted, but there were no legal means of preparing Catholic priests;
candidates for the priesthood, however, might go to semi- naries on the
Continent. Some of these students adopted the genial manners and liberal
views of the hierarchy in France and Italy; returning to Ireland as
priests, they were welcomed at the tables of educated Protestants, and
helped to soften bigotry on both sides. By the time that Henry Grattan
en- tered the Irish Parliament (1775) the movement for Catholic
emancipation had won the support of thousands of Protestants in both
England and Ire- land.</p>
<p>In 1 760 Ireland was governed by a lord lieutenant, or viceroy,
appointed by and responsible to the king of England; and by a Parliament
dominated in the House of Lords by Anglican bishops, and in the House of
Commons by Anglican landowners and governmental placemen, or pensioners.
Elec- tions to Parliament were subject to the same system of “rotten”
and “pocket”</p>
<p>Catholic resistance to English rule was sporadic and ineffective. In
1763 bands of Catholics called “Whiteboys”— from the white shirts they
wore over their clothes — roamed the countryside, tearing down enclosure
fences, crippling cattle, and assaulting the collectors of taxes or
tithes; the leaders were caught and hanged, and the rebellion collapsed.
The movement for national liberation fared better. In 1776 most British
troops were taken from Ireland for service in America; at the same time
the Irish economy was de- pressed by cessation of trade with America; to
guard against domestic revolt or foreign invasion the Protestants of
Ireland formed an army called the Volunteers. These grew in number and
power until, by 1780, they were a redoubtable force in politics. It was
through support by these forty thou-</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>chap, xxxi )</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>sand armed men that Henry Flood and Henry Grattan won their
legislative victories.</p>
<p>Both of them were officers in the Volunteers, and both were among the
greatest orators in a country which could send Burke and Richard
Sheridan to England and still have a store of eloquence left. Flood
entered the Irish Parliament in 1759. He led a brave campaign to reduce
venality in a House where half the members were indebted to the
government. He was defeated by wholesale bribery, and surrendered (1775)
by accepting the office of vice-treasurer at a salary of £ 3,500.</p>
<p>In that year Henry Grattan was elected to the Parliament by a Dublin
constituency. He soon took Flood’s place as leader of the opposition. He
announced an ambitious program: to secure relief to Irish Catholics, to
free Dissenters from the Test Act, to end English restrictions on Irish
trade, and to establish the independence of the Irish Parliament. He
pursued these aims with an energy, devotion, and success that made him
the idol of the nation, Catholic or Protestant. In 1778 he secured
passage of a bill enabling Catholics to take leases of ninety-nine
years, and to inherit land on the same condi- tions as Protestants. A
year later, on his urging, the Test Act was repealed, and full civil
rights were assured to Dissenters. He and Flood persuaded the Irish
Parliament and the Viceroy that the continuance of British obstructions
to Irish trade would lead to revolutionary violence. Lord North, then
head- ing the British government, favored repeal of the restrictions;
English manu- facturers bombarded him with petitions against repeal; he
yielded to them. The Irish began to boycott British goods. The
Volunteers assembled before the Irish Parliament House with arms in
their hands and cannon labeled “Free Trade or This.” The English
manufacturers, hurt by the boycott, withdrew their opposition; the
English ministry withdrew its veto; the Free Trade Act was passed
(1779).</p>
<p>Grattan next pressed for the independence of the Irish Parliament.
Early in 1780 he moved that only the king of England, ’with the consent
of the Parliament of Ireland, could legislate for Ireland, and that
Great Britain and Ireland were united only by the bond of a common
sovereign. His motion was defeated. The Volunteers, meeting at Dungannon
25,000 strong (Feb- ruary, 1782), announced that if legislative
independence were not granted, their loyalty to England would cease. In
March Lord North’s aged ministry fell; Rockingham and Fox came into
power. Meanwhile Cornwallis had sur- rendered at Yorktown (1781); France
and Spain had joined America in war against England; Britain could not
afford to face an Irish revolution at this time. On April 16, 1782, the
Irish Parliament, led by Grattan, declared its legislative independence;
a month later this was conceded by England. The Irish Parliament voted a
grant of £ 1 00,000 to Grattan, who was a relatively poor man; he
accepted half.</p>
<p>This, of course, was a victory for the Protestants of Ireland, not
for the Catholics. When Grattan — strongly supported by the Anglican
Bishop Fred- erick Hervey — went on to campaign for a measure of
Catholic emancipation, the best he could do (in what historians call
“Grattan’s Parliament”) was to</p>
<p>762</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>win the franchise for propertied Catholics (1792); these few received
the right to vote but not the right to be elected to Parliament, to
municipal of- fice, or to the judiciary. Grattan went to England,
secured election to the British Parliament, and there continued his
campaign. He died in 1820, nine years before that Parliament passed the
Catholic Relief Act, which admitted Catholics to the Irish Parliament.
Justice is not only blind, it limps.</p>

<li>THE SCOTTISH BACKGROUND</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Union of 1707 merged Scotland with England through a joint
Parliament, London quipped that the whale had swallowed Jonah; when Bute
(1762 f.) brought a score of Scots into the British government the wits
grumbled that Jonah was swallowing the whale. 6 Politically the whale
won: the sixteen Scottish peers and forty-five commoners were engulfed
by 108 English peers and 513 commoners. Scotland submitted its foreign
policy, and in large measure its economy, to legislation dominated by
English money and minds. The two countries did not forget their former
enmity: the Scots complained of commercial inequalities between Jonah
and the whale, and Samuel Johnson spoke for the whale in biting at Jonah
with chauvinistic iteration.</p>
<p>Scotland in 1760 had a population of some 1,250,000 souls. The birth
rate was high, but the death rate followed close. Said Adam Smith,
toward 1770: “It is not uncommon, I have been told, in the High lands of
Scotland, for a mother who has borne twenty children not to have two
alive.” 7 The High - land chieftains owned nearly all the land outside
the towns, and kept the tenant farmers primitively poor on a rocky soil
harassed by summer down- pours, and by winter snow from September to
May. Rents were repeatedly raised — on one farm from five pounds to ^20
in twenty-five years. 8 Many peasants, seeing no escape from poverty at
home, emigrated to America; so, said Johnson, “a rapacious chief could
make a wilderness of his estate.” 9 The landlords pleaded depreciation
of the currency as their excuse for raising rents. Conditions were even
worse in the coal mines and salt pits, where, until 1775, workers were
bound to their jobs as long as they lived. 10</p>
<p>In the Lowland towns the Industrial Revolution brought prosperity to
an expanding and enterprising middle class. Southwest Scotland was
dotted with textile factories. Glasgow, through industries and foreign
trade, grew from a population of 12,500 in 1707 to eighty thousand in
1800; it had rich suburbs, slum tenements, and a university. In 1768-90
a canal was dug con- necting the Rivers Clyde and Forth, so establishing
an all-water commercial route between the industrial southwest and the
political southeast. Edinburgh — which had some fifty thousand
inhabitants in 1740 — was the focus of Scot- land’s government,
intellect, and fashion; every well -to-do Scottish family aspired to
spend at least a part of the year there; here came Boswell and Burns,
here lived Hume and Robertson and Raeburn; here were renowned</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>763</p>
<p>lawyers like the Erskines, and a prestigious university, and the
Royal Soci- ety of Edinburgh. And here were the headquarters of Scottish
Christianity.</p>
<p>Roman Catholics were few, but enough, as we have seen, to cause
trepida- tion in a land still reverberating with echoes of John Knox.
The Episcopal Church had many adherents among the affluent, who liked
the bishops and ritual of the Anglican communion. But the allegiance of
the great majority went to the Church of Scotland, the Presbyterian
Kirk, which rejected bish- ops, minimized ritual, and accepted in
religion and morals no other rule than that of its parish sessions, its
district presbyteries, its provincial synods, and its General Assembly.
Probably nowhere else in Europe except Spain was a people so thoroughly
imbued with theology. The kirk session, composed of elders and minister,
could levy fines and inflict penalties for misconduct and heresy; it
could sentence fornicators to stand up and be publicly rebuked during
the service; Robert Burns and Jean Armour were thus chastened in a kirk
session on August 6, 1786. The Calvinist eschatology dominated the
common mind, making free thought a danger to life and limb; but a group
of “Moderate” clergymen— led by Robert Wallace, Adam Ferguson, and
William Robertson — tempered the intolerance of the people sufficiently
to allow David Hume a natural death.</p>
<p>Perhaps a hard religion was required to counter the revels of a
people so cold that they drank to intoxication, and so poor that their
only pleasure lay in sexual pursuit. The career of Burns indicates that
the men drank and for- nicated despite the Devil and the dominies, and
that willing girls were not rare. In the final quarter of the eighteenth
century there was a marked de- cline in religious belief and in
adherence to the traditional morality. William Creech, an Edinburgh
painter, noted that in 1763 Sunday had been a day of religious devotion;
in 1783 “attendance on church was greatly neglected, and particularly by
the men”; and at night the streets were noisy with loose and riotous
youth. “In 1763 th ere were five or six brothels;… in 1783 the number of
brothels had increased twenty-fold, and the women of the town more than
a hundred-fold. Every quarter of the city and the suburbs was infected
with multitudes of females abandoned to vice.” 11 Gol f was luring men
from church to the links on Sundays, and on weekdays men and women
danced (formerly a sin), went to theaters (still a sin), attended horse
races, and gambled in taverns and clubs.</p>
<p>The Kirk was the chief source of democracy and education. The congre-
gation chose the elders, and the minister (usually chosen by a “patron”)
was expected to organize a school in every parish. The hunger for
education was intense. Of the four universities, that of St. Andrews was
in decay, but claimed to have the best library in Britain. Johnson found
the University of Aberdeen flourishing in 1773. The University of
Glasgow had on its faculty Joseph Black, physicist, Thomas Reid,
philosopher, and Adam Smith, economist, and was sheltering James Watt.
Edinburgh University was the youngest of the four, but it was alive with
the excitement of the Scottish Enlightenment.</p>

<li>THE SCOTTISH ENLIGHTENMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the growth of trade with England and the world, and the rise of
industry in the Lowlands, can explain the outburst of genius that
illuminated Scotland between Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature (1739) and
Boswell’s Life of Johnson (1791). In philosophy Francis Hutcheson, David
Hume, and Adam Ferguson; in economics Adam Smith; in literature John
Home, 12 Henry Home (Lord Karnes) , William Robertson, James Macpherson,
Rob- ert Burns, James Boswell; in science Joseph Black, James Watt,
Nevil Mas- kelyne, James Hutton, Lord Monboddo; 13 in medicine John and
William Hunter: 14 here was a galaxy to rival the stars that shone in
England around the Great Bear! Hume, Robertson, and others formed in
Edinburgh a “Se - lect Society” for weekly discussions of ideas. These
men and their like kept in touch with French rather than English
thought, partly because France had for centuries been associated with
Scotland, partly because the lingering hostility between Englishmen and
Scots impeded the fusion of the two cul- tures. Hume had a low opinion
of the English mind in his time until, in the year of his death, he
gratefully acclaimed The Decline and Fall of the Ro- man Empire.</p>
<p>We have already discharged our debt to Hutcheson and Hume. 15 Now we
look a t Hume’s genial enemy, Thomas Reid, who strove to bring philos -
ophy back from idea-listic metaphysics to an acceptance of objective
reality. While teaching at Aberdeen and Glasgow he wrote his Inquiry
into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764). Before
publishing it he sent the manuscript to Hume with a courteous letter
conveying compli- ments, and explaining his regret that he had to oppose
the older man’s skep - tical philosophy. Hume replied with
characteristic amiability, and bade him publish without fear of
reproach. 16</p>
<p>Reid had formerly yielded to Berkeley’s view that we know only ideas,
never things; but when Hume, by similar reasoning, contended that we
know only mental states, never a “mind” additional to them, Reid felt
that such a finical analysis undermined all distinctions between true
and false, right and wrong, and all belief in God or immortality. To
avoid this debacle, he thought, he had to refute Hume, and to refute
Hume he had to reject Berkeley.</p>
<p>So he ridiculed the notion that we know only our sensations and
ideas; on the contrary, we know things directly and immediately; it is
only “from an excess of refinement” that we analyze our experience of a
rose, for example, and reduce it to a bundle of sensations and ideas;
the bundle is real, but so is the rose, which maintains an obstinate
persistence when our sensations of it cease. Of course the primary
qualities — size, shape, solidity, texture, weight, motion, number —
belong to the objective world, and are subjectively altered only through
subjective illusions; and even the secondary qualities have an objective
source insofar as physical or chemical conditions in the object or</p>
<p>chap. xxxi ) England’s neighbors 765</p>
<p>he environment give rise to the subjective sensations of smell,
taste, warmth, brightness, color, or sound. 17</p>
<p>Common sense tells us this, but “the principles of common sense” are
not the prejudices of unlettered multitudes; they are the instinctive
“principles… which the constitution of our nature [the sense common to
us all] leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take
for granted in the common concerns of life.” 18 Compared with this
universal sense, daily tested</p>
<p>Hume took all this good- naturedly. He could not accept Reid’s
theologi - cal conclusions, but he respected his Christian temper, and
perhaps he was secretly relieved to learn that after all, despite
Berkeley, the external world existed, and that, despite Hume, Hume was
real. The public too was re-</p>
<p>lieved, and bought three editions of Reid’s Inquiry before he died.
Boswell was among the comforted; Reid’s book, he tells us, “settled my
mind, which had been very uneasy from speculations in the abstruse and
skeptic al style.” 21</p>
<p>Art added color to Scotland’s Age of Light. The four Adam
brothers,</p>
<p>who left their mark on English architecture, were Scots. Allan Ramsay
(son of the poet Allan Ramsay), failing to win honors in his native
Edinburgh, migrated to London (1752), and, after years of labor, became
painter-in- ordinary to the King, much to the fury of English artists.
He made a good portrait of George III, 22 but a still better one of his
own wife. 23 The disloca- tion of his right arm ended his career as a
painter.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Raeburn was the Reynolds of Scotland. Son of an Edinburgh
manufacturer, he taught himself oil painting, and portrayed a widowed
heiress to such satisfaction that she married him and dowered him with
her fortune. After two years of study in Italy he returned to Edinburgh
(1787). Soon he had more patrons than he had time to paint: Robertson,
John Home, Dugald Stewart, Walter Scott, and, best of his portraits,
Lord Newton — an immense body, a massive head, a character of iron
mingled with balm. At opposite poles is the modest loveliness that
Raeburn found in his wife. 24 Sometimes he rivaled Reynolds in picturing
children, as in the Drummond Children in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Raeburn was knighted in 1822, but died a year later, aged
sixty-seven.</p>
<p>The Scottish Enlightenment excelled in historians. Adam Ferguson
shared in founding the study of sociology and social psychology with his
Essay on</p>
<p>7 66</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>he History of Civil Society (1767), which had seven editions in his
lifetime. History (Ferguson argued) knows man only as living in groups;
to under- stand him we must see him as a social but competitive
creature, composed of gregarious habits and individualistic desires.
Character development and so- cial organization are determined by the
interplay of these contrary tenden- cies, and are seldom affected by the
ideals of philosophers. Economic rivalry, political oppositions, social
inequalities, and war itself are in the nature of man; they will
continue; and by and large they advance the progress of man- kind.</p>
<p>Ferguson in his day was as famous as Adam Smith, but their friend
Wil- liam Robertson won still wider renown. We recall Wieland’s hope
that Schiller as historian would “rise to a level with Hume, Robertson,
and Gib - bon.” 25 Horace Walpole asked in 1759: “Can we think that we
want writers of history while Mr. Hume and Mr. Robertson are living?…
Robert- son’s work is one of the purest style, and of the greatest
impartiality, that I have ever read.” 28 Gibbon wrote in his Memoirs:
“The perfect composition, the nervous language, the well-turned periods
of Dr. Robertson influenced me to the ambitious hope that I might one
day tread in his footsteps”; 27 and he was “elated as often as I find
myself ranked in the triumvirate of British historians” with Hume and
Robertson. 28 He ranked these two with Guic - ciardini and Machiavelli
as the greatest of modern historians, and later called Robertson “the
first historian of the present age.” 29</p>
<p>Like Reid, Robertson was a clergyman son of a clergyman. Installed as
minister at Gladsmuir at the age of twenty-two (1743), he was elected
two years later to the General Assembly of the Kirk. There he became the
leader of the Moderates, and protected heretics like Hume. After six
years of labor, and careful study of documents and authorities, he
issued in 1759 a History of Scotland during the Reigns of Queen Mary and
of fames VI until His Accession to the Crown of England; he modestly
ended where Hume’s His - tory of England had begun. It pleased Scotland
by avoiding idolatry of Mary Queen of Scots, and pleased Englishmen with
its style — though Johnson was amused to find in it some Johnsonianly
cumbrous words. The book went through nine editions in fifty-three
years.</p>
<p>But Robertson’s masterpiece was his three -volume History of the
Reign of the Emperor Charles V (1769). We may judge of the reputation
that he had won from the price paid him by the publishers, ,£4,500, as
compared with the £ 600 he had received for the History of Scotland. All
Europe ac- claimed the new book in its various translations. Catherine
the Great carried it with her on her long journeys; “I never leave off
reading it,” she said, “especially the first volume”; 30 like all of us
she was delighted with the long prologue, which reviewed medieval
developments leading to Charles V. The book has been superseded by later
research, but no later presentation of the subject can compare with it
as a piece of literature. It is pleasant to note that the praise which
the book received, considerably greater than that accorded to Hume’s
History, did not cool the friendship of the minister and the
heretic.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>767</p>
<p>More famous than either was James Macpherson, who was ranked with
Homer by Goethe, and above Homer by Napoleon. 31 In 1760 Macpherson,
then twenty-four years old, announced that an epic of some length and
splendor existed in scattered Gaelic manuscripts, which he would under-
take to collect and translate if he could secure some financial aid.
Robertson, Ferguson, and Hugh Blair (eloquent Presbyterian minister of
Edinburgh) raised the money; Macpherson and two Gaelic scholars toured
the High- lands and the Hebrides, gathering old manuscripts; and in 1762
Macpherson published Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books,…
Composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal, Translated from the Gaelic
Language. A year later he issued another epic, Temora, allegedly by
Ossian; and in 1765 he published both as The Works of Ossian.</p>
<p>Ossian, in Gaelic (Irish and Scottish) legend, was the poet son of
the warrior Finn MacCumhail; 82 he lived, we are told, three hundred
years, long enough to express his pagan opposition to the new theology
brought to Ireland by St. Patrick. Some poems attributed to him were
preserved in three fifteenth-century manuscripts, chiefly in The Book of
Lismore, which James Macgregor compiled in 1512; Macpherson had these
manuscripts. 33 Fingal told how the young warrior, having defeated
Scottish invaders of Ireland, invited them to a feast and a song of
peace. The story is vividly told, warmed by the Scots’ appreciation of
Irish girls. “Thou art snow on the heath,” says one warrior to Morna,
daughter of King Cormac; “thy hair is the mist of Cromla when it curls
on the hill, when it shines to the beam of the west! Thy breasts are two
smooth rocks seen from Branno of streams; thy arms like two white
pillars in the halls of the great Fingal.” 34 We meet other bosoms, less
rocky: “white bosom,” “high bosom,” “heavy bosom”; 35 they are a bit
distracting; but soon the tale turns from love to the hatreds of
war.</p>
<p>Macpherson’s Ossian made a stir in Scotland, England, France, and Ger
- many. Scots hailed it as a page from their heroic medieval past.
England, which in 1765 was welcoming Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry, was ripe for the romance of Gaelic legend. Goethe, toward the
end of Werther (1774), showed his hero reading to Lotte six pages of
Ossian. These were the story of the tender maiden Daura, as told by her
father, Armin: how the wicked Erath lured her out to a rock in the sea
by promis- ing that her lover, Armar, would meet her there; how Erath
abandoned her o n the rock, and no lover came. “She lifted up her voice;
she called for her brother and her father: ‘Arindal! Armin!’” Arindal
rowed out to rescue her, but an arrow well aimed by a hidden enemy slew
him. Lover Armar came to the shore, tried to swim out to Daura; “sudden
a blast from the hill came over the waves; he sank, and he rose no
more.” The father, too old and weak to go to her, cried out in horror
and despair.</p>
<p>Alone on the sea-beat rock my daughter was heard to complain.
Frequent and loud were her cries. What could her father do? All night I
stood on the shore. I saw her by the faint beam of the moon…. Loud was
the wind; the rain beat hard on the hill. Before morning appeared her
voice was weak. It</p>
<p>768</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>died away like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent
with grief she expired.</p>
<p>Gone is my strength in war! fallen my pride among women! When the
storms aloft arise, when the north wind lifts the wave on high, I sit by
the sounding shore, and look on the fatal rock. Often, by the setting
moon, I see the ghosts of my children…. Will none of you speak in pity ?
36</p>
<p>Controversy soon arose: was Ossian really a translation from old
Gaelic ballads, or was it a series of poems by Macpherson and foisted
upon a poet who perhaps never lived? Herder and Goethe in Germany,
Diderot in France, Hugh Blair and Lord Karnes in Scotland, credited
Macpherson’s claim. But in 1775 Samuel Johnson, in A Journey to the
Western Islands of Scotland, after some inquiries in the Hebrides
(1773), declared of the “Ossianic” poems: “I believe they never existed
in any other form but that which we have seen. The editor, or author,
never could show the original, nor can it be shown by any other.” 37
Macpherson wrote to Johnson that only the Englishman’s age protected him
from a challenge or a beating. Johnson replied: “I hope I shall never be
deterred from detecting what I think a cheat, by the meanness of a
ruffian…. I thought your book an imposture, I think it an imposture
still…. Your rage I defy.” 38 Hume, Horace Walpole, and others joined in
Johnson’s doubts. Asked to produce the originals which he claimed to
have translated, Macpherson delayed; but at his death he left the
manuscripts of Gaelic ballads, some of which he had used in contriving
the plot and setting the tone of his poems. Many phrases and names he
took from these texts; the two epics, however, were his own composition.
39</p>
<p>The deception was not so complete or so heinous as Johnson supposed;
let us call it poetic license on too grand a scale. Taken in themselves,
the two prose-poetry epics warranted some of the admiration they
received. They conveyed the beauty and terrors of nature, the fury of
hatred, and the zest of war. They were tenderly sentimental, but they
had some of the nobility that Sir Thomas Malory had conveyed in Le Morte
d’ Arthur ( 1470). They rose to fame on the Romantic wave that engulfed
the Enlightenment.</p>

<li>ADAM SMITH</li>
</ol>
<p>Next to Hume, Adam Smith was the greatest figure in the Scottish En-
lightenment. His father, controller of the customs at Kirkaldy, died
some months before Adam’s birth (1723). Almost the only adventure the
econo - mist had in his life came when, a child of three years, he was
kidnapped by gypsies, who, being pursued, abandoned him beside the road.
After some schooling at Kirkaldy, and attending the courses of Hutcheson
at Glasgow, Adam went down to Oxford (1740), where he found the teachers
as lazy and worthless as Gibbon would describe them in 1752. Smith
educated him- self by reading, but the college authorities confiscated
his copy of Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature as quite unfit for a
Christian youth. One year with the dons was enough; loving his mother
better, he returned to Kirkaldy,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>769</p>
<p>and continued to absorb books. In 1748 he moved to Edinburgh, where
he lectured independently on literature and rhetoric. His discourses
impressed influential persons; he was appointed to the chair of logic in
the University of Glasgow (1751), and a year later became professor of
moral philosophy — which included ethics, jurisprudence, and political
economy. In 1759 he published his ethical conclusions in Theory of Moral
Sentiments, which Buckle, ignoring Aristotle and Spinoza, pronounced
“the most important work that has ever been written on this interesting
subject.” 40</p>
<p>Smith derived our ethical judgments from our spontaneous disposition
to imagine ourselves in the position of others; thereby we echo their
emotions, and by this sympathy, or fellow feeling, we are moved to
approve or con- demn. 41 The moral sense is rooted in our social
instincts, or in the mental habits developed by us as members of a
group; but it is not inconsistent with self- love. The summit of a man’s
moral development comes when a man learns to judge himself as he judges
others, “to command h imself according to the objective principles of
equity, natural law, prudence, and justice.” 42 Religion is not the
source nor the mainstay of our moral sentiments, but these are strongly
influenced by belief in the derivation of the moral code from a
rewarding and punishing God. 43</p>
<p>In 1 764 Smith, now forty-one, was engaged as tutor and guide to
accom- pany the eighteen-year-old Duke of Buccleuch on a tour of Europe.
The fee, £ 300 a year for life, gave Smith the security and leisure for
his master- piece, which he began to write during an eighteen-month stay
in Toulouse. He visited Voltaire at Ferney, and in Paris he met
Helvetius and d’Alembert, Quesnay and Turgot. Returning to Scotland in
1766, he lived for the next ten years contentedly with his mother in
Kirkaldy, working on his book. The Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of
the Wealth of Nations appeared in 1776, and was greeted with a letter of
praise from Hume, who died shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Hume himself, in his essays, had helped to form the economic as well
as the ethical views of Adam Smith. He had ridiculed the “mercantile
system,” which favored protective tariffs, trade monopolies, and other
governmental measures to ensure an excess of exports over imports, and
the accumulation of precious metals as a nation’s basic wealth. This
policy, said Hume, was like toiling to keep water from seeking its
natural level; and he called for liberation of the econ omy from the
“numberless bars… and imposts which all nations of Europe, and none more
than England, have put upon trade.” 44 Of course Smith was acquainted
with the campaign of Quesnay and other French physiocrats against the
obstructive regulations of industry and trade by guilds and governments,
and their demand for a laissez-faire policy that would let nature take
its course, and all prices and wages find their level in free
competition. The revolt then rising in America against British restr
ictions on colonial trade was part of the background of Smith’s thought.
If the freedom of trade which he proposed had guided the British
government, the year of his book might not have seen the Declaration of
In- dependence.</p>
<p>770</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Smith had some ideas about the strife between Britain and America. He
considered the English monopoly of colonial trade to be one of the “mean
and malignant expedients of the mercantile system.” 45 He proposed t hat
if the colonists refused to be taxed to support the expenses of the
British Em- pire, America should be given its independence without
further quarrel. “By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of
the colonists to the mother country… would quickly revive. It might
dispose them… to favor us in war as well as in trade, and, instead of
turbulent and factious subjects, to become our most faithful… and
generous allies.” 46 And he added: “Such has hitherto been the rapid
progress of that country in wealth, population, and improvement, that in
the course of little more than a century, perhaps, the produce of
America might exceed that of British taxation. The seat of empire would
then naturally remove itself to that part of the empire which
contributed most to the general defense and support of the whole.”
47</p>
<p>Smith defined the wealth of a nation not as the amount of gold or
silver it possessed, but as the land with its improvements and products,
and the people with their labor, services, skills, and goods. His thesis
was that, with some exceptions, the greatest physical wealth results
from the greatest eco- nomic liberty. Self-interest is universal, but if
we let this powerful motive operate with the greatest economic freedom
it will stimulate such industry, enterprise, and competition as will
generate more riches than any other sys- tem known to history. (This was
Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees 48 worked out in detail.) Smith believed
that the laws of the market — especially the law of supply and demand —
would harmonize the liberty of the producer with the welfare of the
consumer; for if a producer made excessive profits, others would enter
the same field, and the mutual competition would keep prices and profits
within fair limits. Moreover, the consumer would enjoy a kind of
economic democracy: by buying or refusing to buy he would in great
measure determine what articles would be produced, what services would
be offered, in what quantity and at what price, instead of having all
these matters dictated by a government.</p>
<p>Following the physiocrats (but judging the products of labor and the
services of trade to be wealth as real as the produce of the land),
Smith called for an end to feudal tolls, guild restrictions,
governmental economic regulations, and industrial or commercial
monopolies, as all limiting that freedom which — by allowing the
individual to work, spend, save, buy, and sell at his pleasure — keeps
the wheels of production and distribution in mo- tion. The government
must laisser faire, must let nature — the natural pro- pensities of men
— operate freely; it must allow the individual to shift for himself, to
find by trial and error the work that he can do, the place that he can
fill, in the economic life; it must let him sink or swim.</p>
<p>According to this system of natural liberty, the sovereign [or the
state] has only three duties to attend to:… first, the duty of
protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other
independent societies; secondly, the duty of protecting, as far as
possible, every member of the society from the in- justice or
oppressions of every other member of it, or the duty of establishing</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>77 1</p>
<p>an exact administration of justice; and thirdly, the duty of
maintaining certain public works and public institutions which it can
never be for the interest of any individual, or small number of
individuals, to erect or maintain. 49</p>
<p>Here was the formula of Jeffersonian government, and the outline of a
state that would enable the new capitalism to grow and flourish
exceedingly. There was a loophole in the formula: what if the duty of
preventing in- justice should imply the obligation to prevent the
inhumane usage of the simple or the weak by the clever or the strong?
Smith answered: such in- justice can come only through monopolies in
restraint of competition or trade, and his principles called for the
suppression of monopolies. We must rely upon the competition of
employers for workers, and of these for jobs, to regulate wages; all
attempts of governments to regulate them are sooner or later frustrated
by the laws of the market. Though labor (and not land, as the
physiocrats held) is the sole source of wealth , 50 it is a commodity,
just like capital, and is subject to the laws of supply and demand.
“Whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workers, it has
always been rather to lower them t han to raise them”; 51 for “whenever
the legislature attempts</p>
<p>The supposed herald of capitalism almost always took the side of the
workers against the employers. He warned against letting merchants and
manufacturers determine the policy of the government.</p>
<p>The interest of the dealers,… in any particular branch of trade or
manu- factures, is always in some respects different from, and even
opposite to, that of the public…. The proposal of any new law, or
regulation of commerce, which comes from this order ought always to be
listened to with great pre- caution…. It comes from an order of men… who
have generally an in- terest to deceive, and even to oppress, the public
and who… have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.
54</p>
<p>Is this Adam Smith or Karl Marx? But Smith defended private property
as an indispensable stimulus to enterprise, and he held that the number
of avail- able jobs, and the wages paid, will depend above all upon the
accumulation and application of capital. 55 Nevertheless, he advocated
high wages as profit- able to employer and employee alike , 56 and urged
the abolition of slavery on the ground that “the work done by free men
comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves.” 57</p>
<p>When we consider Smith himself, in his appearance, habits, and
character, we wonder that a man so removed from the processes of
agriculture, indus- try, and trade should have written about these
esoteric complexities with such realism, insight, and audacity. He was
as absent-minded as Newton, and cared little for convention. Usually
mannerly and mild, he was capable of meeting Samuel Johnson’s rudeness
with a four -word retort that ques-</p>
<p>772</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>ioned the Great Cham’s legitimacy. After publishing The Wealth of Na
- tions he spent two years in London, where he enjoyed the acquaintance
of Gibbon, Reynolds, and Burke. In 177® he — apostle of free trade — was
ap- pointed commissioner of customs from Scotland. Thereafter he lived
in Edinburgh with his mother, remaining a bachelor to the end. She died
in 1784; he followed her in 1790, aged sixty-seven.</p>
<p>His achievement lay not so much in the originality of his thought as
in the mastery and co-ordination of data, the wealth of illustrative
material, the illuminating application of theory to current conditions,
a simple, clear, and persuasive style, and a broad viewpoint that raised
economics from a “dismal science” to the level of philosophy. His book
was epochal because it sum - marized and explained — of course it did
not produce — the facts and forces that were changing feudalism and
mercantilism into capitalism and free en- terprise. When Pitt II reduced
the duty on tea from 1 19 to twelve and a half per cent, and tried in
general to bring about freer trade, he acknowledged his indebtedness to
The Wealth of Nations. Lord Rosebery tells how, at a dinner attended by
Pitt, the whole company rose when Smith entered, and Pitt said, “We will
stand till you are seated, for we are all your scholars.” 58 Sir James
Murray- Pulteney predicted that Smith’s work “would persuade the present
generation and govern the next.” 59</p>
<p>V. ROBERT BURNS</p>
<p>“My ancient but ignoble blood,” said Scotland’s greatest poet, “has
crept through scoundrels since the Flood.” 60 We shall go no further
back than William Burnes, no scoundrel but a hard-working, irascible
tenant farmer. In 1757 he married Agnes Brown, who presented him Robert
in 1759. Six years later William took lease of a seventy-acre farm at
Mount Oliphant; there the multiplying family lived “sparingly” in an
isolated house. Robert received tutoring at home and attended a parish
school, but from the age of thirteen he worked on the farm. When he was
fourteen “a bonnie, sweet, sonsy [jolly] lass initiated me into a
certain delicious passion, which, in spite of acid disappointment,
ginhorse prudence, and bookworm philosophy, I hold to be the finest of
human joys.” 61 At fifteen he met a second “angel,” and spent feverish
night s thinking of her. His brother recalled that Robert’s “attachment
[to women] became very strong, and he was constantly the victim of some
fair enslaver.” 62</p>
<p>In 1777, in a spell of reckless courage, William Burnes leased the
Lochlie farm, 1 30 acres, in Tarbolton, for which he contracted to pay £
1 30 a year. Now Robert, eighteen, the eldest of seven children, became
the chief worker, for William, broken by unrewarding toil, was
prematurely old. Father and son drew apart as the one narrowed into
puritanism and the other eased into a broader code. Despite parental
prohibition Robert attended a dancing school; “from that instance of
rebellion,” the poet recalled, “he took a kind of dislike to me, which I
believe was one cause of that dissipation</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>which marked my future years.” 63 At the age of twenty -four Robert
joined a Freemason lodge. In 1783 the farm was attached for default of
rent. Robert and his brother Gilbert pooled their poverty to lease a
farm of 1 18 acres for ninety pounds a year; there for four years they
labored, allowing themselves seven pounds each per year for personal
expenses; and there they supported their parents, sisters, and brothers.
The father died in 1784 of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In the long winter evenings Robert read many books, including Robert-
son’s histories, Hume’s philosophy, and Paradise Lost. “Give me a spirit
like my favorite hero, Milton’s Satan.” 64 Resenting the Kirk’s
censorship of morals, he found no difficulty in discarding its theology
and keeping only a vague faith in God and immortality. He laughed at
“Orthodox, orthodox, who believe in John Knox,” and he suspected that
the dominies, between Sundays , were secretly as sinful as himself. 65
In “The Holy Fair” (about a religious revival meeting) he described a
succession of preachers flaying sin and brandishing hell, while harlots
outside waited confidently for the con- gregation’s patronage.</p>
<p>Burns ’s dislike for clergymen gained fervor when one of them sent an
agent to rebuke and fine him for sleeping unwed with Betty Paton. It be-
came anger when his kindly landlord, Gavin Hamilton, was censured by the
kirk session of Mauchline (1785) for repeated absence from church
services. Now the poet wrote his sharpest satire, “Holy Willie’s
Prayer,” which ridi - culed the Pharisaic virtue of William Fisher, an
elder of the Mauchline kirk. Burns pictured him addressing God:</p>
<p>I bless and praise Thy matchless might,</p>
<p>When thousands Thou hast left in night,</p>
<p>That I am here afore thy sight,</p>
<p>For gifts an’ grace</p>

<p>Burns did not dare publish this poem; it reached print three years
after his death.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was giving the Kirk plenty of reason for reproof. He
called himself a “fornicator by profession.” 66 Every second maiden
stirred him: “charming Chloe, tripping o’er the pearly lawn,” Jean
Armour, Highland Mary Campb ell, Peggy Chalmers, “Clarinda,” Jenny
Cruikshank, Jenny of Dairy “cornin’ thro’ the rye,” “bonnie wee” Deborah
Davies, Agnes Flem - ing, Jeanie Jaffrey, Peggy Kennedy of “bonnie

<p>When Betty Paton bore him a child (May 22, 1785) Burns offered to
marry her; her parents rejected the offer. He turned to Jean Armour and
gave her a written promise of marriage; soon she was pregnant. On June
25, 1786, he appeared before the kirk session and admitted his
responsibility; he had (he said) considered himself married to Jean, and
would stand by his pledge; but her father refused to let her marry a
seventeen-year-old farmer already burdened with an illegitimate child.
On July 9, in his pew at church, Burns humbly received public reproof.
On August 3 Jean bore twins. On August 6 he and Jean accepted rebuke
before the congregation, and were</p>

<p>“absolved from the scandal.” The father swore out a warrant for
Burns’s arrest; the poet went into hiding, and planned to take ship to
Jamaica. The warrant was not executed, and Robert returned to his farm.
In that same summer he promised to marry Mary Campbell and take her to
America; she died before they could act on the plan; Burns celebrated
her in “Highland Mary” and “To Mary in Heaven.” 72</p>
<p>In that prolific year 1786 he published at Kilmarnock, by
subscription, his first volume of verse. He omitted poems likely to
offend the Kirk or the morals of the folk; he delighted his readers with
his Scottish dialect and his descriptions of familiar scenery; he
pleased the peasants by raising the details of their life into
intelligible verse. Probably no other poet ever expressed such fellow
feeling for animals sharing the burden of the farmer’s day, or the
“silly sheep” bewildered in the driving snow, or the mouse dislodged
from his nest by the advancing plow.</p>

<p>O wad some pow’r the giftie gie us</p>
<p>To see oursels as ithers see us. 73</p>
<p>To make sure that his little book would be welcomed, Burns capped it
with “The Cotter’s Saturday Night”: the farmer resting after a week of
heavy toil; his wife and children gathering about him, each with a tale
of the day; the oldest daughter timidly introducing the shy courter; the
happy sharing in the simple fare; the Bible-reading by the father; the
united prayer. To this pleasant picture Burns add ed a patriotic
apostrophe to “Scotia, my dear, my native soil!” — Of the 612 copies
printed all but three were sold in four weeks, netting Burns twenty
pounds.</p>
<p>He had thought of using the proceeds to pay for passage to America;
in- stead he devoted them to a sojourn in Edinburgh. Arriving there on a
bor- rowed horse in November, 1786, he shared a room and bed with
another rural youth. Some noisy harlots occupied the floor above them.
74 The favor- able reception of his book by Edinburgh reviewers opened
doors to him; for a season he was an idol of polite society. Sir Walter
Scott described him: I was a lad of fifteen in 1786-87 when Burns came
first to Edinburgh…. I saw him one day at the late venerable Professor
Ferguson, where there were several gentlemen of literary reputation….
His person was strong and ro- bust; his wanness rustic, not clownish; a
sort of dignified plainness and sim- plicity…. His countenance massive,…
the eye large and of a dark cast, which glowed… when he spoke…. Among
the men, who were the most learned of their time and country, he
expressed himself with perfect firmness, but without the least
forwardness. 75</p>
<p>Not alone.</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Burns was encouraged to issue an enlarged edition of his poems. To
give the new volume added substance he proposed to include one of his
major productions, “The Jolly Beggars,” which he had not ventured to
print in the Kilmarnock volume. It described an assemblage of tramps,
paupers, crimi- nals, poets, fiddlers, harlots, and crippled, derelict
soldiers in Nancy Gibson’s alehouse at Mauchline. Burns, put into their
mouths the most candid and un- repentant autobiographies, and ended the
medley with a drunken chorus:</p>
<p>A fig for those by law protected!</p>
<p>Liberty’s a glorious feast!</p>
<p>Courts for cowards were erected,</p>
<p>Churches built to please the priest. 76</p>
<p>Hugh Blair, scholar and preacher, expressed alarm at the thought of
publish- ing such a snub to the virtues; Burns yielded, and later forgot
that he had written the poem; 77 a friend preserved it, and it saw the
light in 1 799.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh editor sold some three thousand copies, netting Burns
X450. He bought a mare and rode out (May 5, 1787) into the Highlands,
and then across the Tweed to sample England. On June 9 he visited his
rela- tives at Mossgiel, and called on Jean Armour; she received him
warmly, and conceived again. Back in Edinburgh, he met Mrs. Agnes
M’Lehose. At seventeen she had married a Glasgow surgeon; at twenty-one
(1780) she left him, taking her children with her, and settled down to
“frugal decency” in the capital. She invited Burns to her home; he fell
in love with her without delay; apparently she did not give herself to
him, for he continued to love her. They exchanged letters and poems, his
signed “Sylvander,” hers “Cla - rinda.” In 1791 she decided to go and
rejoin her husband in Jamaica; Burns sent her, as his farewell, some
tender lines:</p>
<p>Ae* fond kiss, and then we sever!</p>
<p>Ae farewell, and then forever!…</p>
<p>Had we never lov’d sae kindly,</p>
<p>Had we never lov’d sae blindly,</p>
<p>Never met nor never parted,</p>
<p>We had ne’er been brokenhearted. 78</p>
<p>She found her husband living with a Negro waitress; she returned to
Edin- burgh.</p>
<p>His passion for her being unfulfilled, Burns sought companionship and
revelry with a local club, the Crochallan Fencibles — men pledged to the
de- fense of their city. There wine and women were the lares et penates
, and bawdy reigned. For them Burns collected old Scots songs, and added
some of his own; several of these found anonymous and esoteric
publication in 1800 as The Merry Muses of Caledonia. Burns’s membership
in this club, his open scorn of class distinctions, 79 and his frank
expression of radical views in religion and politics rapidly ended his
welcome in Edinburgh society.</p>
<p>He tried to secure a post as a tax collector; repeatedly put off, he

<p>himself to another venture in farming. In February, 1788, he rented
the Ellisland farm, five miles from Dumfries, twelve from Carlyle’s
Craigen - puttock. The owner, who candidly described the soil as “in the
most miser - abl e state of exhaustion,” 80 advanced the poet £ 300 to
build a farmhouse and fence the field; Burns was to pay fifty pounds
annually for three years, then seventy pounds. Meanwhile Jean Armour
gave birth to twins (March 3, 1788), who soon died. Some time before
April 28 Burns married her; with her one surviving child of the four she
had borne him she came to serve him faithfully as wife and housekeeper
at Ellisland. She gave him another child, whom Burns called “my chef -
d’oeuvre in that species of manu facture, as I look upon ‘Tam o’Shanter’
to be my standard performance in the political line.” 81 In 1790 he
became intimate with Anna Park, waitress in a Dumfries tavern; in March,
1791, she bore him a child, which Jean took and brought up with her own.
82</p>
<p>Life was hard at Ellisland. Nevertheless he continued to write great
po- etry. There he added two famous stanzas to an old drinking song,
“Auld Lang Syne.” Burns worked until he too, like his father, broke
down. He was glad to be appointed (July 14, 1788) an exciseman, and so
to travel about the country gauging casks, examining victualers,
chandlers, and tanners, and reporting to the Excise Board in Edinburgh.
Despite frequent bouts with John Barleycorn he seems to have satisfied
the board. In November, 1791, he sold his farm at a profit, and moved
with Jean and the three children to a house in Dumfries.</p>
<p>He offended the respectable folk of the town by frequenting the
taverns, and coming home drunk, on many occasions, to patient Jean. 83
He contin- ued to be a great poet; in those five years at Dumfries he
composed “Ye banks an’ braes o’ bonnie Doon,” “Scots wha’ hae wi’
Wallace bled,” and “O my luve’s like a red, red rose.” Finding no mental
mate in his wife, he corresponded with — sometimes visited —
Mrs. Frances Dunlop, who had in her veins some residue of Wallace’s
blood; she strove to tame Burns’s morals and vocabulary, not always to
the benefit of his verse. He appreciated better the five-pound notes she
sent him now and then. 84</p>
<p>He endangered his commission as exciseman by his radical views. He
told George III, in fifteen excellent stanzas, to get rid of his corrupt
ministers, and advised the Prince of Wales to end his dissipations, and
his “rattlin’ dice withe Charlie [Fox],” if he wished to inherit the
throne. 85 In a letter to the Edinburgh Courant he applauded America’s
Declaration of Independence, and in 1789 he was an “enthusiastic votary”
of the French Revolution. In 1 795 he sent out a blast against rank
distinctions:</p>
<p>Is there for honest poverty</p>
<p>That hings* his head and a’ that?</p>
<p>The coward slave, we pass him by;</p>
<p>We dare be poor for a’ that!</p>

<p>It’s coming yet, for a’ that,</p>
<p>That man to man the world o’er</p>
<p>Shall brithers be for a’ that.</p>
<p>Complaints were made to the Excise Board that such a radical was no
fit man to check chandlers and gauge casks, but the commissioners
forgave him for his love and praise of Scotland. The ninety pounds a
year his post brought him hardly sufficed to keep him in oats and ale.
He continued to roam sexually, and in 1793 Mrs. Maria Ridell, who
confessed his “irresistible power of attraction,” bore him a child. Hi s
repeated intoxication at last weakened his mind and his pride. Like
Mozart in this same decade, he sent begging letters to his friends. 86
Stories went around that he had syphilis, and had been found, one bitter
morning in January, 1796, lying drunken in the snow. 87 These reports
have been criticized as unconfirmed heresy, and Scot- tish doctors

<p>scended from the Earl of Arran, a great-grandson of James II of
Scotland. His mother was descended from the third Earl of Lennox, who
was grand- father of Lord Darnley, who was father of James VI. James
Boswell was born in Edinburgh October 29, 1740. As the eldest of three
sons he was heir to the modest estate of Auchinleck (which he pronounced
“Affleck”) ; but, since his father lived till 1782, James had to be
discontent with such income as the Laird allowed him. Brother John
suffered in 1762 the first of several attacks of insanity. Boswell
himself was oppressed with spells of hypochon- dria, for which his cures
were the amnesia of alcohol and the warmth of female forms. His mother
taught him the Presbyterian Calvinist creed, which had a warmth of its
own. “I shall never forget,” he later wrote, “the dismal hours of
apprehension that I have endured in my youth from narrow notions of
religion, while my mind was lacerated with infernal horror.” 90
Throughout his life he oscillated between faith and doubt, piety and
venery, and never achieved more than momentary integration or
content.</p>
<p>After some tutoring at home, he was sent to the University of
Edinburgh, then to Glasgow, where he attended the lectures of Adam Smith
and studied law. At Glasgow he met actors and actresses, some of them
Catholic. It seemed to him that their religion was more compatible than
Calvinism with a jolly life; he liked especially the doctrine of
purgatory, which allowed a sinner to be saved after a few aeons of
burning. Suddenly James rode off to London (March, 1760), and joined the
Roman Church.</p>
<p>His alarmed father sent a plea to the Earl of Eglinton, an Ayrshire
neigh- bor living in London, to take James in hand. The Earl pointed out
to the youth that as a Catholic he could never practice law, or enter
Parliament, or inherit Auchinleck. James returned to Scotland and the
Kirk, and lived under the paternal roof and eye; but, as the judge was
busy, his son managed to “catch a Tartar” 91 — the first of his many
bouts with venereal disease. Fearing that this reckless youth, on
inheriting Auchinleck, would squander the estate in revelry, the father
persuaded him, in return for an annuity of £ 100, to sign a document
giving the future management of the property to trustees named by
Boswell Senior.</p>
<p>On October 29, 1761, James came of age, and his annuity was doubled.
In the following March he impregnated Peggy Doig; in July he passed his
bar examination. On November 1, 1762, leaving ten pounds to Peggy, he
set out for London. (Her child was born a few days later; Boswell never
saw it.) In London he took a comfortable room in Downing Street. By
Novem- ber 25 he “was really unhappy for want of women”; 92 but he
remembered his infection, and “the surgeons’ fees in this city are very
high.” 93 So he steeled himself to continence “till I got some safe
girl, or was liked by some woman of fashion.” 94 His impression was that
London provided every va-</p>

<p>riety of courtesan, “from the splendid Madam at fifty guineas a night
down to the civil nymph… who… will resign her engaging person to your
honor for a pint of wine and a shilling.” 95 He developed a connection
with “a handsome actress,” Louisa, whose long resistance seemed to
attest hygiene. Finally he persuaded her, and achieved quintuple
ecstasy; “she declared I was a prodigy.” 96 Eight days later he
discovered that he had gonorrhea. By February 27 he felt cured; on March
25 he picked up a streetwalker, and “engaged her in armor” (with a
prophylactic sheath). On March 27 “I heard service at St. Dunstan’s
Church.” On March 31 “I strolled into the Park and took the first whore
I met.” 97 During the next four mon ths Bos- well’s London Journal
records similar bouts— on Westminster Bridge, in Shakespeare’s Head
Tavern, in the park, in a tavern on the Strand, in the Temple law
courts, in the girl’s home.</p>
<p>This, of course, is only one side of the picture of a man, and to
group these scattered episodes in one paragraph gives a false impression
of Bos- well’s life and character. The other side of him was his
“enthusiastic love of great men.” 98 His first catch in this pursuit was
Garrick, who sipped Bos - well’s c ompliments and took to him readily.
But James aimed at the top. In Edinburgh he had heard Thomas Sheridan
describe the erudition and meaty conversation of Samuel Johnson. It
would be a “kind of glory” to meet this pinnacle of London’s literary
life.</p>
<p>Chance helped him. On May 16, 1763, Boswell was drinking tea in</p>
<p>Thomas Davies’ bookshop in Russell Street when “a man of most
dreadful appearance” entered. Boswell recognized him from a portrait of
Johnson by Reynolds. He begged Davies not to reveal that he came from
Scotland; Davies “roguishly” revealed it at once. Johnson did not lose
the opportunity to remark that Scotland was a good country to come from;
Boswell winced. Johnson complained that Garrick had refused him a free
ticket for Miss Wil- liams to a current play; Boswell ventured to say,
“Sir, I cannot think that Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to
you.” Johnson bore down on him: “Sir, I have known David Garrick longer
than you have done , and I know no right you have to talk to me on the
subject.” This hardly promised a life - long friendship; Boswell was
“stunned” and “mortified”; but after some more conversation “I was
satisfied that though there was a roughness in his manner, there was no
ill- nature in his disposition.” 99</p>
<p>Eight days later, encouraged by Davies, and fortified by his
pachyderma- tous audacity, Boswell presented himself at Johnson’s rooms
in the Inner Temple, and was received with kindness if not with charm.
On June 25 bear and cub supped together at the Mitre Tavern in Fleet
Street. “I was quite proud to think on whom I was with.” On July 22
“Mr. Johnson and I had a room at the Turk’s Head Coffee - house.” “After
this,” Boswell wrote in his journal, “I shall just mark Mr. Johnson’s
memorabilia as they rise up in my memory.” 100 So the great biography
began.</p>
<p>When, at his father’s urging, Boswell left for the Netherlands
(August 6, 1763) to study law, master and man jibed so well that
Johnson, aged fifty- three, accompanied Boswell, aged twenty-two, to
Harwich to see him off.</p>

<p>He settled in Utrecht, studied law, learned Dutch and French, and (he
tells us) read all of Voltaire’s Essai sur les moeurs. He suffered at
the outset a severe attack of melancholy, upbraided himself as a
worthless philanderer, and thought of suicide. He blamed his recent
dissipation on his loss of reli- gious faith. “I w as once an infidel; I
acted accordingly; I am now a Christian gentleman.” 101 He drew up an
“Inviolable Plan” of self -reform: he would prepare himself for the
duties of a Scottish laird; he would “be steady to the</p>
<p>He regained his interest in life when he was accepted in the homes of
the well-to- do Dutch. Now he dressed “in scarlet and gold,… white silk
stockings, handsome pumps,… Barcelona handkerchief, and elegant
toothpick case.” 103 He fell in love with Isabella van Tuyll, known to
her ad - mirers as “Belle de Zuylen,” and also as “Zelide”; we have
already paid our respects to her as one of many brilliant women in the
Holland of those years. But she avoided marriage, and Boswell convinced
himself that he had rejected her. He tried Mme. Geelvinck, a pretty
widow, but found her “de - licious and impregnable.” 104 Finally “I
determined to take a trip to Amster - dam and have a girl.” Arrived
there, he “went to a bawdy house…. I was hurt to find myself in the
sinks of gross debauchery.” The next day “I went</p>
<p>Having carried out his promise to his father that he would study
faith- fully at Utrecht, he received paternal permission and funds for
the usual grand tour that crowned a young English gentleman’s education.
He bade farewell to Zelide, sure she had tears of love in her eyes, and
on June 18, 1764, he crossed the border into Germany. For almost two
years thereafter he and Belle corresponded, exchanging compliments and
barbs. From Berlin, July 9, he wrote:</p>
<p>As you and I, Zelide, are perfectly easy with each other, I must tell
you that I am vain enough… as to imagine that you really was in love
with me…. I am too generous not to undeceive you…. 1 would not be
married to you to be a king…. My wife must be a character directly
opposite to my dear Zelide, except in affection, in honesty, and in good
humor. 108</p>
<p>She did not answer. He wrote again on October i, assuring her that
she loved him; she did not answer. He wrote again on December 25:</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, I am proud, and I shall be proud always. You ought to
be flattered by my attachment. I know not if I ought to have been
equally flattered by yours. A man who has a heart and mind like mine is
rare. A woman with many talents is not so rare…. Perhaps you are able to
give me an explanation of your conduct toward me. 107</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>782 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>Her reply deserves a place in the history of woman:</p>
<p>I received your letter with joy and read it with gratitude…. All
those expressions of friendship and all those promises of eternal regard
and of con- stantly tender recollection which you have collected [from
her past words to him] are acknowledged and renewed by my heart at this
moment…. You went on repeating… that I was in love with you…. You would
have me admit this, you were determined to hear me say it and say it
again. I find this a very strange whim in a man who does not love me and
thinks it incumbent upon him (from motives of delicacy) to tell me so in
the most express and vigorous terms…. I was shocked and saddened to
find, in a friend whom I had conceived of as a young and sensible man,
the puerile vanity of a fatuous fool.</p>
<p>My dear Boswell, I will not answer for it that never at any moment
may my talk, my tone, or my look have kindled with you. If it happened,
forget it.</p>
<p>… But never lose the memory of so many talks when the pair of us were
equally lighthearted: I well content in the flattery of your attachment,
and you as happy to count me your friend as if there were something rare
about a woman with many talents. Keep the memory, I say, and be sure
that my tender- ness, my esteem, I would even say my respect, are yours
always. 108</p>
<p>This letter chastened Boswell transiently; he kept his peace for a
year. Then (January 16, 1766) he wrote from Paris to Zelide’s father,
asking for her hand. “Would it not be a pity if so fortunate an alliance
were unreal - ized?” 109 The father answered that Zelide was considering
another offer. A year later Boswell sent her a direct proposal. She
replied, “I read your be - lated endearments with pleasure, with a
smile. Well, so you once loved me!” 1 !#— and she refused his offer.</p>
<p>While this epistolary game was going on, Boswell had sampled many
countries and women. In Berlin he saw Frederick on the paradeground, but
no nearer. He took to his bed a pregnant chocolate vendor; she seemed a
safe port. In Leipzig he met Gellert and Gottsched; at Dresden he
visited “the grand gallery of pictures, which I was told is the noblest
in Europe.” 111 He passed down through Frankfurt, Mainz, Karlsruhe, and
Strasbourg into Switzerland. We have already accompanied him on his
visits to Rousseau and Voltaire. In those exalted days the aura of
genius and the fever of fame subdued the lust of youth.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1765, he left Geneva to cross the Alps. He spent nine
ex- hilarating months in Italy, saw every major city, and sampled
feminine wares at every stop. In Rome he sought out Winckelmann, kissed
the Pope’s slip - pered foot, prayed in St. Peter’s, and caught his
favorite disease again. He ascended Vesuvius with John Wilkes. In Venice
he shared the same courte- san with Lord Mountstuart (son of the Earl of
Bute), and renewed his in- fection. In a month at Siena he courted
Porzia Sansedoni, the mistress of his friend Mountstuart; he urged her
not to let any sentiment of fidelity inter- fere with generosity, for
“my Lord is so formed that he is incapable of fidelity himself, and does
not expect it of you.” 112</p>
<p>His better side showed in his next exploit. From Livorno he took ship
to Corsica (October 11, 1765). Paoli had liberated the island from Genoa
in 1757, and was now in the eighth year of his rule of the new state.
Boswell</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI )</p>
<p>ENGLAND S NEIGHBORS</p>
<p>783</p>
<p>reached him at Sollacaro, and presented a letter of introduction from
Rous- seau. He was at first suspected as a spy, but “I took the liberty
to show him a memorial I had drawn up on the advantages to Great Britain
from an alli- ance with Corsica”; thereafter he dined regularly with the
General. 113 He took many notes that served him later in writing his
Account of Corsica (1768). He left the island on November 20, and
traveled along the Riviera to Marsei lles. There “a tall and decent
pimp” secured for him “an honest, safe, and disinterested girl.” 114</p>
<p>From Aix-en-Provence he began to send to The London Chronicle news
paragraphs to be released in successive issues from January 7, 1766,
inform- ing the British public that James Boswell was approaching
England with firsthand data on Corsica. Arriving in Paris (January 12),
he received word from his father that his mother had died. He undertook
to escort Rousseau’s Therese Levasseur to London; if we may believe him
she gave herself to him en route. He dallied in London for three weeks,
saw Johnson on several occasions, and finally presented himself to his
father in Edinburgh (March 7, 1766). His three years and four months of
independence and travel had done something to mature him. It had not
weakened his lust nor tempered his vanity, but it had broadened his
knowledge and perspective, and had given him a new poise and self-
confidence. He was now “Corsican Boswell,” a man who had dined with
Paoli, and who was writing a book that might stir England to go to the
Liberator’s aid and make the island a British strong - hold in a
strategic sea.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Boswell at Home</li>
</ol>
<p>On July 29, 1766, he was admitted to the Scottish bar, and for the
next twenty years his life was centered in Edinburgh, with many forays
into Lon- don and one to Dublin. Helped perhaps by his father’s position
as a judge, but also by his readiness in debate, he “came into great
employment,” and “made sixty - five guineas” in his first winter before
the courts. 115 An exuber- ant generosity mingled with his self-esteem;
he defended the lowliest crim- inals, spent his florid eloquence on
obviously guilty persons, lost most of his cases, and dissolved his fees
in drink. After those sunny months in Italy he felt to his bones the
cold of Scotland, for which there seemed no cure but alcohol.</p>
<p>He continued his sexual wandering. He took a Mrs. Dodds as his
mistress, but to supplement her services he “lay all night with… a
common girl,” and presently “discovered that some infection had reached
me.” 116 Three months later, in a vertigo of intoxication, he tells us
that he “went to a bawdy house, and passed a whole night in the arms of
a whore. She was a fine, strong, spirited girl, a whore worthy of
Boswell, if Boswell must have a whore.” 117 Another infection. Obviously
marriage was the only device that could save him from physical and moral
degeneration. He courted Catherine Blair; she rejected him. He fell in
love with Mary Ann Boyd, an Irish lass with a Grecian form and a rich
father. He followed her to Dublin</p>

<p>(March, 1769), lost his passion on the way, got drunk, went to an
Irish prostitute, contracted venereal disease again. 118</p>
<p>In February, 1768, he sent to the press An Account of Corsica, The
Jour- nal of a Tour to That Island, and Memoirs of Pascal Paoli. Its
plea for Brit- ish aid to Paoli caught the imagination of England, and
prepared public opinion to approve the action of the British government
in sending secret arms and supplies to the Corsicans. The book sold ten
thousand copies in England; it was translated into four languages, and
gave Boswell more fame on the Continent than Johnson enjoyed. On
September 7, 1769, the author appeared at the Shakespeare festival in
Stratford in the garb of a Corsican chief, with “Corsican Boswell”
inscribed on his hat; but, as this was for a masquerade ball, it did not
quite deserve the ridicule it received.</p>
<p>His cousin Margaret Montgomerie had accompanied him to Ireland, and
had borne humbly with his Irish courtship and revelry. She was two years
older than he, and her £ 1,000 made her no equal match (as Boswell
Senior urged) for the heir of Auchinleck, but when he contemplated her
patient devotion to him it dawned upon him that she was a good woman and
would make a good wife; moreover, his reputation for lechery and
drinking had narrowed his choice. The judge himself was contemplating
marriage, which would put a stepmother between father and son, and might
eat into the es- tate. Boswell begged his father not to marry; the
father persisted; they quar- reled; Boswell thought of going to America.
On July 20, 1769, he wrote to “Peggy” Montgomerie asking would she marry
him and consent to go with him to America and live on his £ 100 a year
and the interest on her £ 1,000. He warned her that he was subject to
periods of melancholy. Her reply (July 22) deserves remembrance:</p>
<p>I have thought fully, as you desired, and… I accept your terms…. J.
B. with £100 a year is every bit as valuable to me as if possessed of
the estate of Auchinleck…. Free of ambition, I prefer real happiness to
the splendid ap- pearance of it…. Be assured, my dear Jamie, you have a
friend that would sacrifice everything for you, who never had a wish for
wealth till now, to bestow it on the man of her heart. 119</p>
<p>On November 19 the father married; on November 25 the son. The</p>
<p>younger couple set up a separate household, and in 1771 they rented a
flat from David Hume. James strove for sobriety, worked hard as an
advocate, and rejoiced in the children his wife bore him. Apparently she
discouraged his marital approaches during the later months of her
repeated pregnancies. On October 27, 1772, he went to a prostitute after
having “too much wine.” 120 He excused himself by arguing that
concubinage was permitted by Scripture. He resumed his drinking, and
added gambling. His journal noted, October 5, 1774: “Drank to
intoxication.” November 3: “Many of us drank from dinner till ten at
night.” November 4: “Much intoxicated;… fell with a good deal of
violence.” November 8: “Drunk again.” No - ve mber 9: “I was very ill,
and could not get up till about two.” December</p>

his ill - nesses.</p>
<p>His drinking had many causes: his many failures at the bar, his
difficulties with his father, his shame of his infidelities, his
awareness that he had not realized the dreams of his vanity, and his
distaste for life in Scotland. Almost yearly he ran off to London,
partly to plead cases there, partly to savor the conversation of
Johnson, Reynolds, Garrick, and Burke. In 1773 he was admitted to “the
Club.” In the fall of that year he proudly walked the streets of
Edinburgh with Dr. Johnson at his side, as a prelude to their tour of
the Hebrides.</p>
<p>At first, on these London trips, he remained faithful to his wife,
and wrote to her fondly; but by 1775 he had resumed his patronage of
promiscuity. He was especially busy toward the end of March, 1776. “When
I got into the street the whoring rage came upon me. I thought I would
devote a night to it.” His devotion continued for several nights. “I
thought of my valuable spouse with the highest regard and warmest
affection, but had a confused notion that my corporeal connection with
whores did not interfere with my love for her.” 122 Another venereal
infection sobered him transi ently.</p>
<p>These exploits, and his subservience to Johnson, earned him scornful
com- ments from men like Horace Walpole, and (posthumously) a lethal
lashing by Macaulay, 123 but they did not leave him friendless. “My
character as a man of parts and extensive acquaintance makes people fond
of my atten- tion.” 124 Most Londoners agreed with Boswell that no woman
had a right to a whole man. If men like Johnson and Reynolds liked him,
and many London homes were open to him, he must have had many amiable
traits. These men of discernment knew that he passed from woman to
woman, and from idea to idea, like a hasty traveler, scratching many
surfaces but never reaching to the heart of the matter, never feeling
the bruised soul behind the sacrificial flesh. An d he knew it, too. “I
have really a little mind with all my pride,” he said; “my brilliant
qualities are like embroidery upon</p>
<p>gauze.” 125 “There is an imperfection, a superficialness, in all my
notions. I understand nothing clearly, nothing to the bottom. I pick up
fragments, but never have in my memory a mass of any size.” 126</p>
<p>It was those fragments, and that memory, that redeemed him. He made
amends for his defects by worshiping in others the excellence that he
could not achieve for himself; by attending upon them humbly, by
remembering their words and deeds, and, at last, with no minor artistry,
placing them in an order and a light that made an unrivaled picture of a
man and an age. And may we never be disrobed, in body and mind, in
secret lust and inde- fatigable vanity, as thoroughly as this man, half
lackey and half genius, re- vealed himself for posterity.</p>
