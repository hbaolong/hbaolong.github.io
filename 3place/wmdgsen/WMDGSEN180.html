<h4 id="chapter-iii-the-progress-of-christianity">CHAPTER III The
Progress of Christianity</h4>
<p>364-451</p>
<p>T HE foster mother of the new civilization was the Church. As the old
order faded away in corruption, cowardice, and neglect, a unique army of
churchmen rose to defend with energy and skill a regenerated stability
and decency of life. The historic function of Christianity was to
re-establish the moral basis of character and society by providing
supernatural sanctions and support for the uncongenial commandments of
social order; to instill into rude barbarians gentler ideals of conduct
through a creed spontaneously compounded of myth and miracle, of fear
and hope and love. There is an epic grandeur, sullied with superstition
and cruelty, in the struggle of the new religion to capture, tame, and
inspire the minds of brute or decadent men, to forge a uniting empire of
faith that would again hold men together, as they had once been held by
the magic of Greece or the majesty of Rome. Institutions and beliefs are
the offspring of human needs, and understanding must be in terms of
these necessities.</p>
<p>I. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</p>
<p>If art is the organization of materials, the Roman Catholic Church is
among the most imposing masterpieces of history. Through nineteen
centuries, each heavy with crisis, she has held her faithful together,
following them with her ministrations to the ends of the earth, forming
their minds, molding their morals, encouraging their fertility,
solemnizing their marriages, consoling their bereavements, lifting their
momentary lives into eternal drama, harvest- ing their gifts, surviving
every heresy and revolt, and patiently building again every broken
support of her power. How did this majestic institution grow?</p>
<p>It began in the spiritual hunger of men and women harassed with
poverty, wearied with conflict, awed by mystery, or fearful of death. To
millions of souls the Church brought a faith and hope that inspired and
canceled death. That faith became their most precious possession, for
which they would die or kill; and on that rock of hope the Church was
built. It was at first a simple</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>CHAP.IIl) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 45</p>
<p>association of believers, an ecclesia or gathering. Each ecclesia or
church chose one or more presbyteroi — elders, priests — to lead them,
and one or more readers, acolytes, subdeacons, and deacons to assist the
priest. As the worshipers grew in number, and their affairs became more
complex, the con- gregations chose a priest or layman in each city to be
an episcopos — overseer, bishop — to co-ordinate their functioning. As
the number of bishops grew, they in turn required supervision and
co-ordination; in the fourth century we hear of archbishops,
metropolitans, or primates governing the bishops and the churches of a
province. Over all these grades of clergy patriarchs held sway at
Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Rome. At the call of
a patriarch or an emperor the bishops and archbishops convened in synods
or councils. If a council represented only a province it was called
provincial; if it represented only the East or the West it was called
plenary; if both, it was general; if its decrees were accepted as
binding upon all Chris- tians, it was ecumenical — i.e., applying to the
oikoumene, or (total Christian) inhabited world. The occasionally
resultant unity gave the Church its name of Catholic, or universal.</p>
<p>This organization, whose power rested at last upon belief and
prestige, required some regulation of the ecclesiastical life. In the
first three centuries of Christianity, celibacy was not required of a
priest. He might keep a wife whom he had married before ordination, but
he ipust not marry after taking holy orders; and no man could be
ordained who had married two wives, or a widow, a divorcee, or a
concubine. Like most societies, the Church was harassed with extremists.
In reaction against the sexual license of pagan morals, some Christian
enthusiasts concluded from a passage in St. Paul 1 that any commerce
between the sexes was sinful; they denounced all mar- riage, and
trembled at the abomination of a married priest. The provincial council
of Gengra ( c. 362) condemned these views as heretical, but the Church
increasingly demanded celibacy in her priests. Property was being left
in rising amounts to individual churches; now and then a married priest
had the bequest written in his name and transmitted it to his children.
Cleri- cal marriage sometimes led to adultery or other scandal, and
lowered the respect of the people for the priest. A Roman synod of 386
advised the complete continence of the clergy; and a year later Pope
Siricius ordered the unfrocking of any priest who married, or continued
to live with his wife. Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine supported this
decree with their triple power; and after a generation of sporadic
resistance it was enforced with transient success in the West.</p>
<p>The gravest problem of the Church, next to reconciling her ideals
with her continuance, was to find a way of living with the state. The
rise of an ecclesiastical organization side by side with the officials
of the government created a struggle for power in which the accepted
subjection of one to the other was the prerequisite of peace. In the
East the Church became sub-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>ordinate to the state; in the West she fought for independence, then
for mastery. In either case the union of Church and state involved a
profound modification of Christian ethics. Tertullian, Origen, and
Lactantius had taught that war is always unlawful; the Church, now
protected by the state, resigned herself to such wars as she deemed
necessary to protect either the state or the Church. She had not in
herself the means of force; but when force seemed desirable she could
appeal to the “secular arm” to implement her will. She received from the
state, and from individuals, splendid gifts of money, temples, or lands;
she grew rich, and needed the state to protect her in all the rights of
property. Even when the state fell she kept her wealth; the barbarian
conquerors, however heretical, seldom robbed the Church. The authority
of the word so soon rivaled the power of the sword.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE HERETICS</li>
</ol>
<p>The most unpleasant task of ecclesiastical organization was to
prevent a fragmentation of the Church through the multiplication of
heresies — i.e., doctrines contrary to conciliar definitions of the
Christian creed. Once tri- umphant, the Church ceased to preach
toleration; she looked with the same hostile eye upon individualism in
belief as the state upon secession or revolt. Neither the Church nor the
heretics thought of heresy in purely theological terms. The heresy was
in many cases the ideological flag of a rebellious local- ity seeking
liberation from the imperial power; so the Monophysites wished to free
Syria and Egypt from Constantinople; the Donatists hoped to free Africa
from Rome; and as Church and state were now united, the rebellion was
against both. Orthodoxy opposed nationalism, heresy defended it; the
Church labored for centralization and unity, the heretics for local
inde- pendence and liberty.</p>
<p>Arianism, overcome within the Empire, won a peculiar victory among
the barbarians. Christianity had been first carried to the Teutonic
tribes by Roman captives taken in the Gothic invasions of Asia Minor in
the third century. The “apostle” Ulfilas (31 1 ?— 8 1 ) was not quite an
apostle. He was the descendant of a Christian captive from Cappadocia,
and was born and raised among the Goths who lived north of the Danube.
About 341 he was consecrated as their bishop by Eusebius, the Arian
prelate of Nicomedia. When the Gothic chieftain Athanaric persecuted the
Christians in his do- minions, Ulfilas obtained permission from the
Arian Constantius to bring the little community of Gothic Christians
across the Danube into Thrace. To instruct and multiply his converts he
patiently translated, from the Greek into Gothic, all the Bible except
the Books of Kings, which he omitted as dangerously martial; and as the
Goths had as yet no written language, he composed a Gothic alphabet
based upon the Greek. His Bible was the first</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 47</p>
<p>literary work in any Teutonic tongue. The devoted and virtuous life
of Ulfilas generated among the Goths such confidence in his wisdom and
in- tegrity that his Arian Christianity was accepted by them without
question. As other barbarians received their Christianity in the fourth
and fifth cen- turies from the Goths, nearly all the invaders of the
Empire were Arians, and the new kingdoms established by them in the
Balkans, Gaul, Spain, Italy, and Africa were officially Arian.
Conquerors and conquered differed by only an iota in their faith: the
orthodox held Christ to be identical in being (homoousios ) , the Arians
considered Him only similar in being ( homoi - ousios), with God the
Father; but the difference became vital in the politics of the fifth and
sixth centuries. By this chance concatenation of events Arianism held
its ground till the orthodox Franks overthrew the Visigoths in Gaul,
Belisarius conquered Vandal Africa and Gothic Italy, and Recared (589)
changed the faith of the Visigoths in Spain.</p>
<p>We cannot interest ourselves today in the many winds of doctrine that
agitated the Church in this period — Eunomians, Anomeans, Apollinarians,
Macedonians, Sabellians, Massalians, Novatians, Priscillianists; we can
only mourn over the absurdities for which men have died, and will.
Manicheism was not so much a Christian heresy as a Persian dualism of
God and Satan, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness; it thought to
reconcile Christianity and Zoroastrianism, and was bitterly buffeted by
both. It faced with unusual candor the problem of evil, the strange
abundance of apparently unmerited suffering in a world providentially
ruled; and felt compelled to postulate an Evil Spirit coeternal with the
Good. During the fourth century Manicheism made many converts in East
and West. Several of the emperors used ruthless measures against it;
Justinian made it a capital crime; gradually it faded out, but it left
its influence on such later heretics as the Paulicians, Bogomiles, and
Albigensians. In 385 a Spanish bishop, Priscillian, was accused of
preach- ing Manicheism and universal celibacy; he denied the charges; he
was tried before the usurping Emperor Maximus at Trier, two bishops
being his ac- cusers; he was condemned; and over the protests of
St. Ambrose and St. Martin he and several of his companions were burned
to death (385).</p>
<p>While meeting all these assailants the Church found herself almost
over- whelmed by the Donatist heresy in Africa. Donatus, Bishop of
Carthage (315), had denied the efficacy of sacraments administered by
priests in a state of sin; the Church, unwilling to risk so much on the
virtues of the clergy, wisely repudiated the idea. The heresy
nevertheless spread rapidly in North Africa; it enlisted the enthusiasm
of the poor, and the theological aberration grew into a social revolt.
Emperors fulminated against the movement; heavy fines and confiscations
were decreed for persistence in it; the power of buying, selling, or
bequeathing property was denied to the Donatists; they were driven from
their churches by imperial soldiery, and the churches were turned over
to orthodox priests. Bands of revolutionaries, at once Christian</p>
<p>48 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>and communist, took form under the name of Circumcelliones, or
prowlers; A they condemned poverty and slavery, canceled debts and
liberated slaves, and proposed to restore the mythical equality of
primitive man. When they met a carriage drawn by slaves they put the
slaves in the carriage and made the master pull it behind him. Usually
they contented themselves with rob- bery; but sometimes, irritated by
resistance, they would blind the orthodox or the rich by rubbing lime
into their eyes, or would beat them to death with clubs; or so their
enemies relate. If they in turn met death they rejoiced, certain of
paradise. Fanaticism finally captured them completely; they gave
themselves up as heretics, and solicited martyrdom; they stopped
wayfarers and asked to be killed; and when even their enemies tired of
complying, they leaped into fires, or jumped from precipices, or walked
into the sea. 2 Augus- tine fought Donatism with every means, and for a
time seemed to have over- come it; but when the Vandals arrived in
Africa the Donatists reappeared in great number, and rejoiced at the
expulsion of the orthodox priests. A tradi- tion of fierce sectarian
hatred was handed down with pious persistence, and left no united
opposition when (670) the Arabs came.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pelagius was stirring three continents with his attack on
the doctrine of original sin, and Nestorius was courting martyrdom by
doubts concerning the Mother of God. Nestorius had been a pupil of
Theodore of Mopsuestia (3 50?-? 42 8), who had almost invented the
Higher Criticism of the Bible. The Book of Job, said Theodore, was a
poem adapted from pagan sources; the Song of Songs was an epithalamium
of frankly sensual signif- icance; many of the Old Testament prophecies
supposedly referring to Jesus alluded only to pre-Christian events; and
Mary was the Mother not of God but only of the human nature in Jesus. 3
Nestorius raised himself to the epis- copal see at Constantinople (428),
drew crowds with his eloquence, made enemies by his harsh dogmatism, and
gave them their opportunity by adopt- ing the ungallant opinion of
Theodore about Mary. If Christ was God, then, said most Christians, Mary
was theotokos , god-bearing, the Mother of God. Nestorius thought the
term too strong; Mary, he said, was mother only of the human, not of the
divine, nature in Christ. It would be better, he sug- gested, to call
her the Mother of Christ.</p>
<p>Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, preached at Easter, 429, a sermon
an- nouncing the orthodox doctrine — that Mary is the true mother not of
the Godhead itself, but of the incarnate Logos, or Word of God,
containing both the divine and the human natures of Christ. 4 Pope
Celestine I, stirred by a letter from Cyril, called a council at Rome
(430), which demanded that Nestorius be deposed or retract. When
Nestorius refused, an ecumenical council at Ephesus (43 1 ) not only
deposed but excommunicated him. Many bishops protested; but the people
of Ephesus broke out into demonstrations of joy that must have awakened
memories of Diana- Artemis. Nestorius was</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 49</p>
<p>allowed to retire to Antioch; but as he continued to defend himself
and de- mand restoration, the Emperor Theodosius II banished him to an
oasis in the Libyan desert. He survived many years; at last the
Byzantine court took pity on him, and sent him an imperial pardon. The
messenger found him dying ( c. 451). His followers withdrew to eastern
Syria, built churches, established a school of learning at Edessa,
translated the Bible, Aristotle, and Galen into Syriac, and played a
vital part in acquainting the Moslems with Greek science, medicine, and
philosophy. Persecuted by the Emperor Zeno, they crossed into Persia,
opened an influential school at Nisibis, flourished under Persian
toleration, and founded communities in Balkh and Samarkand, in India and
China. Scattered through Asia, they survive to this day, still de-
nouncing Mariolatry.</p>
<p>The last great heresy of this turbulent period, and the most
momentous in result, was announced by Eutyches, head of a monastery near
Constanti- nople. In Christ, said Eutyches, there were not two natures,
human and divine; there was only the divine. Flavian, the patriarch of
Constantinople, called a local synod which condemned this “Monophysite”
heresy, and ex - communicated Eutyches. The monk appealed to the bishops
of Alexandria and Rome; Dioscoras, who had succeeded Cyril, persuaded
the Emperor Theodosius to call another council at Ephesus (449).
Religion was subordi- nated to politics; the Alexandrian see continued
its war upon the see of Con- stantinople; Eutyches was exonerated, and
Flavian was assailed with such oratorical violence that he died. 5 The
council issued anathemas against any man who should hold that there were
two natures in Christ. Pope Leo I had not attended the council, but had
sent it several letters (“Leo’s tome”) supporting Flavian. Shocked by
the report of his delegates, Leo branded the council as the “Robber
Synod,” and refused to recognize its decrees. A later</p>
<p>To perfect the confusion, the majority of Christians in Syria and
Egypt refused to accept the doctrines of two natures in the one person
of Christ. The monks of Syria continued to teach the Monophysite heresy,
and when an orthodox bishop was appointed to the see of Alexandria he
was torn to pieces in his church on Good Friday.® Thereafter
Monophysitism became the national religion of Christian Egypt and
Abyssinia, and by the sixth cen- tury predominated in western Syria and
Armenia, while Nestorianism grew in Mesopotamia and eastern Syria. The
success of the religious rebellion strengthened political revolt; and
when the conquering Arabs, in the seventh</p>

<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>century, poured into Egypt and the Near East, half the population
welcomed them as liberators from the theological, political, and
financial tyranny of the Byzantine capital.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE CHRISTIAN WEST</li>
</ol>

<li>Rome</li>
</ol>
<p>The bishops of Rome, in the fourth century, did not show the Church
at her best. Sylvester (314-35) earned the credit for converting
Constantine; and pious belief represented him as receiving from the
Emperor in the “Donation of Constantine” nearly all of western Europe;
but he did not be - h ave as if he owned half the white man’s world.
Julius I (337 -52) strongly affirmed the supreme authority of the Roman
see, but Liberius ( 3 5 2-66) sub- mitted, through weakness or age, to
the Arian dictates of Constantius. Upon his death Damasus and Ursinus
contested the papacy; rival mobs supported them in the most vigorous
tradition of Roman democracy; in one day and in one church 137 persons
were killed in the dispute. 7 Praetextatus, then pagan prefect of Rome,
banished Ursinus, and Damasus ruled for eighteen years with pleasure and
skill. He was an archaeologist, and adorned the tombs of the Roman
martyrs with beautiful inscriptions; he was also, said the irreverent,
an auriscalpius matronarum , a scratcher of ladies’ ears— i.e., an
expert in wheedling gifts for the Church from the rich matrons of Rome.
8</p>
<p>Leo I, sumamed the Great, held the throne of Peter through a
generation of crisis (440-61), and by courage and statesmanship raised
the Apostolic See to new heights of power and dignity. When Hilary of
Poitiers refused to accept his decision in a dispute with another Gallic
bishop, Leo sent him peremptory orders; and the Emperor Valentinian III
seconded these with an epoch-making edict imperially confirming the
authority of the Roman bishop over all Christian churches. The bishops
of the West gener- ally acknowledged, those of the East resisted, this
supremacy. The patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and
Alexandria claimed equal au- thority with the Roman see; and the furious
controversies of the Eastern Church proceeded with scant obeisance to
the bishop of Rome. Difficulties of communication and travel combined
with diversity of language to alienate the Western from the Eastern
Church. In the West, however, the popes exer- cised a growing leadership
even in secular affairs. They were subject in non- religious matters to
the Roman state and prefect, and until the seventh cen- tury they sought
the confirmation of their election from the emperor. But the distance of
the Eastern and the weakness of the Western rulers left the popes
pre-eminent in Rome; and when, in the face of invasion, both Senate and
emperor fled, and civil government collapsed, while the popes stood
unawed at their posts, their prestige rapidly rose. The conversion of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 51</p>
<p>Western barbarians immensely extended the authority and influence of
the Roman see.</p>
<p>As rich and aristocratic families abandoned paganism for
Christianity, the Roman Church participated more and more in the wealth
that came to the Western capital; and Ammianus was surprised to find
that the bishop of Rome lived like a prince in the Lateran Palace, and
moved through the city with the pomp of an emperor. 9 Splendid churches
now (400) adorned the city. A brilliant society took form, in which
elegant prelates mingled happily with ornate women, and helped them to
make their wills.</p>
<p>While the Christian populace joined the surviving pagans at the
theater, the races, and the games, a minority of Christians strove to
live a life in har- mony with the Gospels. Athanasius had brought to
Rome two Egyptian monks; he had written a life of Anthony, and Rufinus
had published for the West a history of monasticism in the East. Pious
minds were influenced by the reported holiness of Anthony, Schnoudi, and
Pachomijas; monasteries were established in Rome by Sixtus III (432-440)
and Leo I; and several families, while still living in their homes,
accepted the monastic rule of chas - tity and poverty. Roman ladies of
wealth, like Marcella, Paula, and three generations of the Melanias,
gave most of their funds to charity, founded hospitals and convents,
made pilgrimages to the monks of the East, and main- tained so ascetic a
regimen that some of them died of self-denial. Pagan circles in Rome
complained that this kind of Christianity was hostile to family life,
the institution of marriage, and the vigor of the state; and polemics
fell heav- ily upon the head of the leading advocate of asceticism — one
of the greatest scholars and most brilliant writers ever produced by the
Christian Church.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>St. Jerome</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born about 340 at Strido, near Aquileia, probably of Dalmatian
stock, and was promisingly named Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius — “the
reverend, holy- named sage.” He received a good education at Trier and
Rome, learned the Latin classics well, and loved them, he thought, to
the point of sin. Nevertheless, he was a positive and passionate
Christian; he joined with Rufinus and other friends to found an ascetic
brotherhood in Aquileia, and preached such counsels of perfection that
his bishop reproved him for undue impatience with the natural frailties
of man. He replied by calling the bishop ignorant, brutal, wicked, well
matched with the worldly flock that he led, the unskillful pilot of a
crazy bark. 10 Leaving Aquileia to its sins, Jerome and some fellow
devotees went to the Near East and entered a monastery in the Chalcis
desert near Antioch (374). The unhealthy climate was too much for them;
two died, and Jerome himself was for a time on the verge of death.
Undeterred, he left the monastery to live as an anchorite in</p>

<p>In 379 he returned to Antioch, and was ordained a priest. In 382 we
find him in Rome as secretary to Pope Damasus, and commissioned by him
to make an improved Latin translation of the New Testament. He continued
to wear the brown robe and the tunic of an anchorite, and lived an
ascetic life amid a luxurious papal court. The pious Marcella and Paula
received him into their aristocratic homes as their spiritual adviser,
and his pagan critics thought he enjoyed the company of women more than
became so passionate a praiser of celibacy and virginity. He replied by
satirizing the Roman soci- ety of the age in ageless terms:</p>
<p>Those women who paint their cheeks with rouge and their eyes</p>
<p>with belladonna, whose faces are covered with powder… whom no number
of years can convince that they are old; who heap their</p>
<p>heads with borrowed tresses… and behave like trembling school-</p>

dresses,</p>
<p>deck themselves in gleaming jewelry, and reek of musk…. Other</p>

<p>women, and prefer to look like eunuchs…. Some unmarried women prevent
conception by the help of potions, murdering human beings before they
are conceived; others, w T hen they find themselves with</p>

are</p>
<p>women who say, “To the pure all things are pure…. Why should I</p>

<p>sometimes drops so as to leave your white shoulders bare; and then it
hastily hides what it intentionally revealed. 18</p>
<p>Jerome adds to the moralist ’s bias the exaggerations of the literary
artist molding a period, and of a lawyer inflating a brief. His satires
recall those of Juvenal, or of our own time; it is pleasant to know that
women have always been as charming as they are today. Like Juvenal,
Jerome denounces impar- tially, fearlessly, and ecumenically. He is
shocked to find concubinage even among Christians, and more shocked to
find it covered by the pretense of practicing chastity the hard way.
“From what •source has this plague of ‘dearly beloved sisters’ found its
way into the church? Whence come these unwedded wives? These novel
concubines, these one-man harlots? They live in the same house with
their male friends; they occupy the same room, often the same bed; yet
they call us suspicious if we think that anything is wrong.” 14 He
attacks the Roman clergy whose support might have raised him to the
papacy. He ridicules the curled and scented ecclesiastics who fre- quent
fashionable society, and the legacy-hunting priest who rises before dawn
to visit women before they have gotten out of bed. 15 He condemns the
marriage of priests and their sexual digressions, and argues powerfully
for clerical celibacy; only monks, he thinks, are true Christians, free
from prop- erty, lust, and pride. With an eloquence that would have
enlisted Casanova, Jerome calls upon men to give up all and follow
Christ, asks the Christian matrons to dedicate their first-born to the
Lord as offerings due under the Law, 16 and advises his lady friends, if
they cannot enter a convent, at least to live as virgins in their homes.
He comes close to rating marriage as sin. “I praise marriage, but
because it produces me virgins”; 17 he proposes to “cut down by the ax
of virginity the wood of marriage,” 18 and exalts John the celibate
apostle over Peter, who had a wife. 19 His most interesting letter (384)
is to a girl, Eustochium, on the pleasures of virginity. He is not
against marriage, but those who avoid it escape from Sodom, and painful
pregnan- cies, and bawling infants, and household cares, and the
tortures of jealousy. He admits that the path of purity is also hard,
and that eternal vigilance is the price of virginity.</p>
<p>Virginity can be lost even by a thought…. Let your companions</p>
<p>be those who are pale of face and thin with fasting…. Let your fasts
be of daily occurrence. Wash your bed and water your couch</p>
<p>nightly with tears…. Let the seclusion of your own chamber ever</p>
<p>guard you; ever let the Bridegroom sport with you within…. When sleep
falls upon you He will come behind the wall, and will put His</p>
<p>hand through the door and will touch your belly ( ventrem ). And</p>
<p>you will awake and rise up and cry, “I am sick with love.” And
you</p>
<p>will hear Him answer: “A garden enclosed is my. sister, my
spouse;</p>
<p>a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.” 20</p>
<p>54 the age of faith (chap, iii</p>
<p>The publication of this letter, Jerome tells us, “was greeted with
showers of stones”; perhaps some readers sensed a morbid prurience in
these strange counsels in a man apparently not yet free from the heat of
desire. When, a few months later (384), the young ascetic Blesilla died,
many blamed the austerities that had been taught her by Jerome; some
pagans proposed to throw him into the Tiber with all the monks of Rome.
Unrepentant, he ad- dressed to the hysterically mournful mother a letter
of consolation and re- proof. In the same year Pope Damasus passed away,
and his successor did not renew Jerome’s appointment as papal secretary.
In 385 he left Rome forever, taking with him Blesilla’s mother Paula,
and Eustochium her sister. At Beth - lehem he built a monastery of which
he became head, a convent over which first Paula and then Eustochium
presided, a church for the common worship of the monks and nuns, and a
hospice for pilgrims to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>He made his own cell in a cave, gathered his books and papers there,
gave himself up to study, composition, and administration, and lived
there the re- maining thirty-four years of his life. He quar reled at
pen’s point with Chrys - ostom, Ambrose, Pelagius, and Augustine. He
wrote with dogmatic force half a hundred works on questions of casuistry
and Biblical interpretation, and his writings were eagerly read even by
his enemies. He opened a school in Bethlehem, where he humbly and freely
taught children a variety of sub- jects, including Latin and Greek; now
a confirmed saint, he felt that he could read again the classic authors
whom he had forsworn in his youth. He resumed the study of Hebrew, which
he had begun in his first sojourn in the East; and in eighteen years of
patient scholarship he achieved that mag- nificent and sonorous
translation of the Bible into Latin which is known to us as the Vulgate,
and remains as the greatest and most influential literary accomplishment
of the fourth century. There w’ere errors in the translation as in any
work so vast, and some “barbarisms” of common speech which offended the
purists; but its Latin formed the language of theology and letters
throughout the Middle Ages, poured Hebraic emotion and imagery into
Latin molds, and gave to literature a thousand noble phrases of compact
eloquence and force.* The Latin world became acquainted with the Bible
as never before.</p>
<p>Jerome was a saint only in the sense that he lived an ascetic life
devoted to the Church; he was hardly a saint in character or speech. It
is sad to find in so great a man so many violent outbursts of hatred,
misrepresentation, and controversial ferocity. He calls John, Patriarch
of Jerusalem, a Judas, a Satan, for whom hell can never provide adequate
punishment; 21 he describes the majestic Ambrose as “a deformed crow”;
22 and to make trouble for his old</p>
<ul>
<li>Jerome’s translation was mostly direct, from the original Hebrew or
Gre ek; at times, how- ever, he translated from the Greek versions of
Aquila, Symmachus, or Theodotion. His trans - lation, revised in 1592
and 1907, is still the standard Latin text of the Bible for the Roman
Catholic world. The “Douai Bible” is the English version of this
Vulgate.</li>

<p>friend Rufinus he pursues the dead Origen with such heresy-hunting
fury as to force the condemnation of Origen by Pope Anastasius (400). We
might rather have pardoned some sins of the flesh than these acerbities
of the soul.</p>
<p>His critics punished him without delay. When he taught the Greek and
Latin classics they denounced him as a pagan; when he studied Hebrew
with a Jew they accused him of being a convert to Judaism; when he
dedicated his works to women they described his motives as financial or
worse. 28 His old age was not happy. Barbarians came down into the Near
East and overran Syria and Palestine ( 395) ; “how many monasteries they
captured, how many rivers were redde ned with blood!” “The Roman world,”
he concluded sadly, “is falling.” 24 While he lived, his beloved Paula,
Marcella, and Eusto - chium died. Almost voiceless and fleshless with
austerities, and bent with age, he toiled day after day on work after
work; he was writing a commentary on Jeremiah when death came. He was a
great, rather than a good, man; a satirist as piercing as Juvenal, a
letter writer as eloquent as Seneca, an heroic laborer in scholarship
and theology.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>Jerome and Augustine were only the greatest pair in a remarkable age.
Among her “Fathers” the early medieval Church distinguished eight as
“Doctors of the Church”: in the East Athanasius, Basil, Gregory
Nazianzen, John Chrysostom, and John of Damascus; in the West Ambrose,
Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory the Great.</p>
<p>The career of Ambrose (340?~398) illustrates the power of
Christianity to draw into its service first-rate men who, a generation
earlier, would have served the state. Born at Trier, son of the prefect
of Gaul, he was by every precedent destined to a political career, and
we are not surprised to hear of him next as provincial governor of
northern Italy. Residing at Milan, he was in close touch with the
emperor of the West, who found in him the old Roman qualities of solid
judgment, executive ability, and quiet courage. Learning that rival
factions were gathering at the cathedral to choose a bishop, he hurried
to the scene, and by his presence and his words quelled an incipient
disturbance. When the factions could not agree on a candidate, someone
suggested Ambrose; his name brought the people to an enthusiastic
unanimity; and the governor, protesting and still unbaptized, was
hurriedly christened, ordained to the diaconate, then to the priesthood,
then to the episcopacy, all in one week (374). 25</p>
<p>He filled his new office with the dignity and mastery of a statesman.
He abandoned the trappings of political position, and lived in exemplary
simplic- ity. He gave his money and property to the poor, and sold the
consecrated plate of his church to ransom captives of war. 20 He was a
theologian who</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>powerfully defended the Nicene Creed, an orator whose sermons helped
to convert Augustine, a poet who composed some of the Church’s earliest
and noblest hymns, a judge whose learning and integrity shamed the
corruption of secular courts, a diplomat entrusted with difficult
missions by both Church and state, a good disciplinarian who upheld but
overshadowed the pope, an ecclesiastic who brought the great Theodosius
to penance, and dominated the policies of Valentinian III. The young
Emperor had an Arian mother, Justina, who tried to secure a church in
Milan for an Arian priest. The con- gregation of Ambrose remained night
and day in the beleaguered church in a holy “sit - down strike” against
the Empress’ orders to surrender the build - ing. “Then it was,” says
Augustine, “that the custom arose of singing hymns and songs, after the
use of the Eastern provinces, to save the people from being utterly worn
out by their long and sorrowful vigils.” 27 Ambrose fought a famous
battle against the Empress, and won a signal victory for
intolerance.</p>
<p>At Nola in southern Italy Paulinus (353-431) exemplified a gentler
type of Christian saint. Born in an old rich family of Bordeaux, and
married to a lady of like high lineage, he studied under the poet
Ausonius, entered politics, and rapidly advanced. Suddenly “conversion”
came to him in the full sense of a turning away from the world: he sold
his property, and gave all to the poor ex- cept enough to keep himself
in the barest necessities; and his wife Therasia agreed to live with him
as his chaste “sister in Christ.” The monastic life not yet</p>
<p>Paulinus wrote charming verse, but only incidentally. The poet who
best expressed the Christian view in this age was the Spaniard Aurelius
Prudentius Clemens ( c. 348-410). While Claudian and Ausonius cluttered
their composi- tions with dead gods, Prudentius sang in the ancient
meters the new and living themes: stories of the martyrs ( Peri
stephanon, or Book of Crowns), hymns for every hour of the day, and an
answer in verse to Symmachus’ plea for the statue of Victory. It was in
this last poem that he made a memorable appeal to Honorius to suppress
gladiatorial combats. He did not hate the pagans; he had kind words for
Symmachus, and even for Julian; and he begged his fellow Christians not
to destroy pagan works of art. He shared Claudian’s admira - tion for
Rome, and rejoiced that one might pass through most of the white man’s
world and be under the same laws, everywhere secure; “wherever we are we
live as fel low citizens.” 28 In this Christian poet we catch a last
echo of the achievement and mastery of Rome.</p>

civilization, Corre -</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 57</p>
<p>sponding to Ausonius and Sidonius in literature were the great
bishops of fourth- century Gaul: Hilary of Poitiers, Remi of Reims,
Euphronius of Autun, Martin of Tours. Hilary (d. c. 367) was one of the
most active defenders of the Nicene Creed, and wrote a treatise in
twelve “books” struggling to explain the Trinity. Yet in his modest see
at Poitiers we see him living the good life of a devoted churchman —
rising early, receiving all callers, hearing complaints, adjusting dis-
putes, saying Mass, preaching, teaching, dictating books and letters,
listening to pious readings at his meals, and every day performing some
manual labor like cultivating the fields, or weaving garments for the
poor. 20 This was the ecclesi- astic at his best.</p>
<p>St. Martin left more of a name; 3675 churches and 425 villages in
France bear it today. He was born in Pannonia about 316; at twelve he
wished to become a monk, but at fifteen his father compelled him to join
the army. He was an un- usual soldier — giving his pay to the poor,
helping the distressed, practicing hu- mility and patience as if he
would make a monastery out of the army camp. After five years in
military service Martin realized his ambition, and went to live as a
monk in a cell, first in Italy, then at Poitiers near the Hilary he
loved. In 371 the people of Tours clamored to have him as their bishop,
despite his shabby garments and rough hair. He agreed, but insisted on
still living like a monk. Two miles from the city, at Marmoutier, he
built a monastery, gathered together eighty monks, and lived with them a
life of unpretentious austerity. His idea of a bishop was of a man who
not only celebrated Mass, preached, administered the sacraments, and
raised funds, but also fed the hungry, clothed the naked, visited the
sick, and helped the unfortunate. Gaul loved him so that all its parts
told stories of his miracles, even of his having raised three men from
the dead. 80 France made him one of her patron saints.</p>
<p>The monastery that Martin had founded at Poitiers (362) was the first
of many that now sprang up in Gaul. Because the monastic idea had come
to Rome through Athanasius’ Life of Anthony , and Jerome’s powerful call
to the anchoritic life, the West first took up the most arduous and
lonely forms of monasticism, and tried to practice in less genial
climates the rigors of monks living under the Egyptian sun. The monk
Wulfilaich lived for years, with bare legs and feet, on a column at
Trier; in winter the nails fell from his toes, and icicles hung from his
beard. St. Senoch, near Tours, enclosed himself so nar- rowly within
four walls that the lower half of his body could not move; in this
situation he lived many years, an object of veneration to the populace.
31 St. John Cassian brought the ideas of Pachomius to balance the
ecstasy of Anthony; inspired by some sermons of Chrysostom, he
established a monastery and con- vent at Marseille (415), and wrote for
it the first Western regimen for the monastic life; before he died (435)
some 5000 monks in Provence were living by his rule. Soon after 400
St. Honoratus and St. Caprasius built a monastery on the island of
Lerins, facing Cannes. These institutions trained men to co- operative
labor, study, and scholarship rather than to solitary devotion; they
became schools of theology, and vitally influenced the thought of the
West. When the rule of St. Benedict came to Gaul in the next century, it
built upon the tradition of Cassian one of the most beneficent religious
orders in history.</p>

<li>The Monks of the East</li>
</ol>
<p>As the Church ceased to be a set of devotees and became an
institution governing millions of men, she tended to adopt a more
lenient view of human frailty, and to tolerate, sometimes to share, the
pleasures of this world. A minority of Christians held such
condescension to be treason to Christ; they resolved to gain heaven by
poverty, chastity, and prayer, and retired com- pletely from the world.
Possibly Ashoka’s missionaries ( c. 25 0 b.c.) had brought to the Near
East the monastic forms as well as the theory and ethics of Buddhism;
and pre-Christian anchorites like those of Serapis in Egypt, or the
Essene communities in Judea, may have transmitted to Anthony and
Pachomius the ideals and methods of the strictly religious life.
Monasticism was for many souls a refuge from the chaos and war of the
barbarian inva- sions; there were no taxes in the monastery or the
desert cell, no military service, no marital strife, no weary toil;
ordination to the priesthood was not required of a monk; and after a few
years of peace would come eternal bliss.</p>
<p>Egypt, whose climate almost invited monasticism, teemed with
anchoritic and cenobitic monks, following the solitary habits of
Anthony, or the com- munity life that Pachomius had established at
Tabenne. The Nile was banked with monasteries and convents, some
containing as many as 3000 monks and nuns. Of the anchorites Anthony (
c. 251-356) was by far the most re- nowned. After wandering from
solitude to solitude he fixed his cell on Mount Kolzim, near the Red
Sea. Admirers found him out, imitated his devotion, and built their
cells as near to his as he would permit; before he died the desert was
peopled with his spiritual progeny. He seldom washed, and lived to the
age of 105. He declined an invitation from Constantine, but at the age
of ninety he journeyed to Alexandria to support Athanasius against the
Arians. Only less famous was Pachomius, who (325) founded nine monas-
teries and one nunnery; sometimes 7000 monks who followed his rule gath-
ered to celebrate some holy day. These cenobites worked as well as
prayed; periodically they sailed down the Nile to Alexandria to sell
their products, buy their necessities, and join in the
ecclesiastical-political fray.</p>
<p>Among the anchorites a keen rivalry arose for the austerity
championship. Macarius of Alexandria, says the Abb6 Duchesne, “could
never hear of any feat of asceticism without at once trying to surpass
it.” If other monks ate no cooked food in Lent, Macarius ate none for
seven years; if some punished themselves with sleeplessness, Macarius
could be seen “frantically endeavor - ing for twenty consecutive nights
to keep himself awake.” Throughout one Lent he stood upright night and
day, and ate nothing except, once a week, a few cabbage leaves; and
during this time he continued to work at his basket-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 59</p>
<p>weaving trade. 32 For six months he slept in a marsh, and exposed his
naked body to poisonous flies. 33 Some monks excelled in feats of
solitude; so Sera- pion inhabited a cave at the bottom of an abyss into
which few pilgrims had the hardihood to descend; when Jerome and Paula
reached his lair they found a man almost composed of bones, dressed only
in a loincloth, face and shoul- ders covered by uncut hair; his cell was
barely large enough for a bed of leaves and a plank; yet this man had
lived among the aristocracy of Rome. 34 Some, like Bessarion for forty,
Pachomius for fifty, years, never lay down while they slept; 35 some
specialized in silence, and went many years without uttering a word;
others carried heavy weights wherever they went, or oound their limbs
with iron bracelets, greaves, or chains._Many proudly recorded the
number of years since they had looked upon a woman’s face. 38 Nearly all
anchorites lived — some to a great age — on a narrow range of food.
Jerome tells of monks who subsisted exclusively on figs or on barley
bread. When Macarius was ill someone brought him grapes; unwilling so to
indulge him- self, he sent them to another hermit, who sent them to
another; and so they made the rounds of the desert (Rufinus assures us)
until they came back intact to Macarius. 37 The pilgrims who flocked
from all quarters of the Chris- tian world to see the monks of the East
credited them with miracles as re- markable as those of Christ. They
could cure diseases or repel demons by a touch or a word, tame serpents
or lions with a look or a prayer, and cross the Nile on the back of a
crocodile. The relics of the anchorites became the most precious
possession of Christian churches, and are treasured in them to this
day.</p>
<p>In the monasteries the abbot required absolute obedience, and tested
nov- ices with impossible commands. One abbot (story says) ordered a
novice to leap into a raging furnace; the novice obeyed; the flame, we
are informed, parted to let him pass. Another monk was told to plant the
abbot’s walking stick in the earth and water it till it flowered; for
years he walked daily to the Nile, two miles away, to draw water to pour
upon the stick; in the third year God took pity on him and the stick
bloomed. 38 Work was prescribed for the monks, says Jerome, 30 “lest
they be led astray by dangerou s imagin- ings.” Some tilled fields, some
tended gardens, wove mats or baskets, carved</p>

and nuns. Jerusalem and Antioch were meshed with monastic communities

<p>cells. The Syrian desert was peopled with anchorites; some of them,
like Hindu fakirs, bound themselves with chains to immovable rocks,
others dis- dained so settled a habitation, and roamed over the
mountains eating grass. 42 Simeon Stylites (39o?~459), we are told, used
to go without food through the forty days of Lent; during one Lent he
was, at his own insistence, walled up in an enclosure with a little
bread and water; on Easter he was unwalled, and the bread and the water
were found untouched. At Kalat Seman, in northern Syria, about 422,
Simeon built himself a column six feet high and lived on it. Ashamed of
his moderation, he built and lived on ever taller col- umns, until he
made his permanent abode on a pillar sixty feet high. Its cir-
cumference at the top was little more than three feet; a railing kept
the saint from falling to the ground in his sleep. On this perch Simeon
lived uninter- ruptedly for thirty years, exposed to rain and sun and
cold. A ladder enabled disciples to take him food and remove his waste.
He bound himself to the pillar by a rope; the rope became embedded in
his flesh, which putrefied around it, stank, and teemed with worms;
Simeon picked up the worms that fell from his sores, and replaced them
there, saying to them, “Eat what God has given you.” From his high
pulpit he preached sermons to the crowds that came to see him, converted
barbarians, performed marvelous cures, played ecclesiastical politics,
and shamed the moneylenders into reducing their interest charges from
twelve to six per cent. 43 His exalted piety created a fashion of pillar
hermits, which lasted for twelve centuries, and, in a thor- oughly
secularized form, persists today.</p>
<p>The Church did not approve of such excesses; perhaps she sensed a
fierce pride in these humiliations, a spiritual greed in this
self-denial, a secret sensu- alism in this flight from woman and the
world. The records of these ascetics abound in sexual visions and
dreams; their cells resounded with their moans as they struggled with
imaginary temptations and erotic thoughts; they be- lieved that the air
about them was full of demons assailing them; the monks seem to have
found it harder to be virtuous in solitude than if they had lived among
all the opportunities of the town. It was not unusual for anchorites to
go mad. Rufinus tells of a young monk whose cell was entered by a beau-
tiful woman; he succumbed to her charms, after which she disappeared, he
thought, into the air; the monk ran out wildly to the nearest village,
and leaped into the furnace of a public bath to cool his fire. In
another case a young woman begged admission to a monk’s cell on the ple
a that wild beasts were pursuing her; he consented to take her in
briefly; but in that hour she happened to touch him, and the flame of
desire sprang up in him as if all his years of austerity had left it
undimmed. He tried to grasp her, but she van- ished from his arms and
his sight, and a chorus of demons, we are told, exulted with loud
laughter over his fall. This monk, says Rufinus, could no longer bear
the monastic life; like Paphnuce in Anatole France’s Thais , he could
not exorcise the vision of beauty that he had imagined or seen; he left
his cell,</p>

<p>plunged into the life of the city, and followed that vision at last
into hell. 44</p>
<p>The organized Church had at first no control over the monks, who
rarely took any degree of holy orders; yet she felt responsibility for
their excesses, since she shared in the glory of their deeds. She could
not afford to agree completely with monastic ideals; she praised
celibacy, virginity, and poverty, but could not condemn marriage or
parentage or property, as sins; she had now a stake in the continuance
of the race. Some monks left their cells or monasteries at will, and
troubled the populace with their begging; some went from town to town
preaching asceticism, selling real or bogus relics, terror- izing
synods, and exciting impressionable people to destroy pagan temples or
statuary, or, now and then, to kill an Hypatia. The Church could not
tolerate these independent actions. The Council of Chalcedon (451) or-
dained that greater circumspection should be used in admitting persons
to monastic vows; that such vows should be irrevocable; and that no one
should organize a monastery, or leave it, without permission from the
bishop of the diocese.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Eastern Bishops</li>
</ol>
<p>Christianity was now (400) almost completely triumphant in the East.
In Egypt the native Christians, or Copts,* were already a majority of
the popu- lation, supporting hundreds of churches and monasteries.
Ninety Egyptian bishops acknowledged the authority of the patriarch in
Alexandria, who almost rivaled the power of the Pharaohs and the
Ptolemies. Some of these patriarchs were ecclesiastical politicians of
no lovable type, like the Theoph- ilus who burned to the ground the
pagan temple and library of Serapis (389). More pleasing is the modest
bishop of Ptolemais, Synesius. Born in Cyrene (c. 365), he studied
mathematics and philosophy at Alexandria under Hy- patia; to the end of
his life he remained her devoted friend, ca lling her “the true exponent
of the true philosophy.” He visited Athens and was there confirmed in
his paganism; but in 403 he married a Christian lady, and gal- lantly
accepted Christianity; he found it a simple courtesy to transform his
Neoplatonic trinity of the One, the nous , and the Soul into the Father,
Spirit, and the Son. 45 He wrote many delightful letters, and some minor
philo- sophical works of which none is of value to anyone today except
his essay In Praise of Baldness. In 410 Theophilus offered him the
bishopric of Ptole- mais. He was now a country gentleman, with more
money than ambition; he protested that he was unfit, that he did not (as
the Nicene Creed required) Believe in the resurrection of the body, that
he was married, and had no in- tention of abandoning his wife.
Theophilus, to whom dogmas were instru- ments, winked at these errors,
and transformed Synesius into a bishop before</p>

<p>he philosopher could make up his mind. It was typical of him that his
last letter was to Hypatia, and his last prayer to Christ. 40</p>
<p>In Syria the pagan temples were disposed of in the manner of
Theophilus. Imperial edicts ordered them closed; the surviving pagans
resisted the order but resigned themselves to defeat on noting the
indifference with which their gods accepted destruction. Asiatic
Christianity had saner leaders than those of Egypt.* In a short life of
fifty years (329? — 3-79) the great Basil learned rhetoric under
Libanius in Constantinople, studied philosophy in Athens, vis- ited the
anchorites of Egypt and Syria, and rejected their introverted asceti-
cism; became bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, organized Christianity in
his country, revised its ritual, introduced self-supporting cenobitic
monasticism, and drew up a monastic rule that still governs the
monasteries of the Greco- Slavonic world. He advised his followers to
avoid the theatrical severities of the Egyptian anchorites, but rather
to serve God, health, and sanity by useful work; tilling the fields, he
thought, was an excellent prayer. To this day the Christian East
acknowledges his pre-eminent influence.</p>
<p>In Constantinople hardly a sign of pagan worship remained.
Christianity itself, however, was torn with conflict; Arianism was still
powerful, new heresies were always rising, and every man had his own
theology. “This city,” wrote Basil’s brother, Gregory of Nyassa, about
380, “is full of me - chanics and slaves who are all of them profound
theologians, and preach in the shops and the streets. If you desire a
man to change a piece of silver he informs you wherein the Son differs
from the Father; if you ask the price of a loaf… you are told that the
Son is inferior to the Father; and if you inquire whether the bath is
ready, the answer is, the Son was made out of nothing.” 47 In the reign
of Theodosius I the Syrian Isaac founded the first monastery in the new
capital; similar institutions rapidly multiplied; and by 400 the monks
were a power and a terror in the city, playing a noisy role in the
conflicts of patriarch with patriarch, and of patriarch with
emperor.</p>
<p>Gregory Nazianzen learned the bitterness of sectarian hatred when he
accepted a call from the orthodox Christians of Constantinople to be
their bishop (379). Valens had just died, but the Arians whom that
Emperor had set up were still in ecclesiastical control, and held their
services in St. Sophia. Gregory had to house his altar and his
congregation in the home of a friend, but he called his modest church by
a hopeful name — Anastasia (Resurrection). He was a man of equal piety
and learning; he had studied in Athens along with his countryman Basil,
and only his second successor would rival his eloquence. His
congregation grew and grew till it was larger than those of the official
basilicas. On the eve of Easter, 379, a crowd of Ari-</p>

Christian world.</li>

<p>CHAP.IIl) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 63</p>
<p>ans attacked the Anastasia chapel with a volley of stones. Eighteen
months later the orthodox Emperor Theodosius led Gregory in pomp and
triumph to his proper throne in St. Sophia. But ecclesiastical politics
soon ended his tranquillity; jealous bishops proclaimed his appointment
invalid, and ordered him to defend himself before a council. Too proud
to fight for his see, Greg- ory resigned (381) and returned to
Cappadocian Nazianzus, to spend the remaining eight years of his life in
obscurity and peace.</p>
<p>When his indifferent successor died, the imperial court invited to
St. Sophia a priest of Antioch known to history as St. John Chrysostom —
of the Golden Mouth. Born (345?) of a noble family, he had imbibed
rhetoric from Liba- nius, and had familiarized himself with pagan
literature and philosophy; in general the Eastern prelates were more
learned and disputatious than those of the West. John was a man of keen
intellect and sharper temper. He dis- turbed his new congregation by
taking Christianity seriously, condemning in plain terms the injustices
and immoralities of the age. 48 He denounced the theater as an
exhibition of lewd women, and as a school of profanity, seduc- tion, and
intrigue. He asked the opulent Christians of the capital why they spent
so much of their wealth in loose living, instead of giving most of it to
the poor as Christ had commanded. He wondered why some men had twenty
mansions, twenty baths, a thousand slaves, doors of ivory, floors of
mosaic, walls of marble, ceilings of gold; and threatened the rich with
hell for enter- taining their guests with Oriental dancing girls. 49 He
scolded his clergy for their lazy and luxurious lives, 50 and their
suspicious use of women to min- ister to them in their rectories; he
deposed thirteen of the bishops under his jurisdiction for
licentiousness or simony; and he reproved the monks of Con- stantinople
for being more frequently in the streets than in their cells. He
practiced what he preached: the revenues of his see were spent not in
the display that usually marked the Eastern bishoprics, but in the
establishment of hospitals and in assistance to the poor. Never had
Constantinople heard sermons so powerful, brilliant, and frank. Here
were no pious abstractions, but Christian precepts, applied so
specifically that they hurt.</p>

<p>Congregations like to be scolded, but not to be reformed. The women
per- sisted in their perfumes, the wealthy in their banquets, the clergy
in their female domestics, the theaters in their revelations; and soon
every group in the city except the powerless poor was against the man
with the golden mouth. The Empress Eudoxia, wife of Arcadius, was
leading the gay set of the capital in luxurious living. Sue interpreted
one of John’s sermons as al - luding to her, and she demanded of her
weakling husband that he call a synod to try the patriarch. In 403 a
council of Eastern bishops met at Chalcedon. John refused to appear, on
the ground that he should not be tried by his enemies. The council
deposed him, and he went quietly into exile; but so great a clamor of
protest rose from the people that the frightened Emperor recalled him to
his see. A few months later he was again denouncing the upper classes,
and made some critical comments on a statue of the Empress. Eudoxia once
more demanded his expulsion; and Theophilus of Alexandria, always ready
to weaken a rival see, reminded Arcadius that the Chalcedon decree of
deposition still stood, and could be enforced. Soldiers were sent to
seize Chrysostom; he was conveyed across the Bosporus, and banished to a
village in Armenia (404). When his faithful followers heard the news
they broke out in wild insurrection; and in the tumult St. Sophia and
the near-by Senate house were set on fire. From his exile Chrysostom
sent letters of appeal to Honorius and the bishop of Rome. Arcadius
ordered him removed to the remote desert of Pityus in Pontus. On the way
the exhausted prelate died at Comana, in the sixty-second year of his
age (407). From that time to this, with brief intermissions, the Eastern
Church has remained the servant of the state.</p>
<p>V. ST. AUGUSTINE (354-430)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Sinner</li>
</ol>
<p>The North Africa in which Augustine was born was a miscellany of
breeds and creeds. Punic and Numidian blood mingled with Roman in the
popu- lation, perhaps in Augustine; so many of the people spoke Punic —
the old Phoenician language of Carthage — that Augustine as bishop
appointed only priests who could speak it. Donatism challenged
orthodoxy, Manicheism challenged both, and apparently the majority of
the people were still pagan. 52 Augustine’s birthplace was Tagaste in
Numidia. His mother, St. Monica, was a devoted Christian, whose life was
almost consumed in caring and praying for her wayward son. His father
was a man of narrow means and broad</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 65</p>
<p>principles, whose infidelities were patiently accepted by Monica in
the firm belief that they could not last forever.</p>
<p>At twelve the boy was sent to school at Madaura, and at seventeen to
hig her studies at Carthage. Salvian would soon describe Africa as “the
cess - pool of the world,” and Carthage as “the cesspool of Africa”; 53
hence Mon - ica’s parting advice to her son:</p>
<p>She commanded me,*and with much earnestness forewarned me,</p>
<p>hat I should not commit fornication, and especially that I should</p>
<p>never defile any man’s wife. These seemed to me no better than</p>
<p>women’s counsels, which it would be a shame for me to follow….</p>
<p>I ran headlong with such blindness that I was ashamed among my</p>
<p>equals to be guilty of less impudency than they were, whom I heard
brag mightily of their naughtiness; yea, and so much the more boast- ing
by how much more they had been beastly; and I took pleasure</p>
<p>o do it, not for the pleasure of the act only, but for the praise of
it</p>
<p>also;… and when I lacked opportunity to commit a wickedness that
should make me as bad as the lost, I would feign myself to have done
what I never did. 54</p>
<p>He proved an apt pupil in Latin also, and in rhetoric, mathematics,
music, and philosophy; “my unquiet mind was altogether intent to seek
for learn - ing.” 55 He disliked Greek, and never mastered it or learned
its literature; but he was so fascinated by Plato that he called him a
“demigod,” 56 and did not cease to be a Platonist when he became a
Christian. His pagan training in logic and philosophy prepared him to be
the most subtle theologian of the Church.</p>
<p>Having graduated, he taught grammar at Tagaste, and then rhetoric at
Carthage. Since he was now sixteen “there was much ado to get me a
wife”; however, he preferred a concubine — a convenience sanctioned by
pagan morals and Roman law; still unbaptized, Augustine could take his
morals where he pleased. Concubinage was for him a moral advance; he
abandoned promiscuity, and seems to have been faithful to his concubine
until their parting in 385. In 382, still a lad of eighteen, he found
himself unwillingly the father of a son, whom he called at one time “son
of my sin,” but more usually Adeodatus — gift of God. He came to love
the boy tenderly, and never let him go far from his side.</p>
<p>At twenty-nine he left Carthage for the larger world of Rome. His
mother, fearing that he would die unbaptized, begged him not to go, and
when he persisted, besought him to take her with him. He pretended to
consent; but at the dock he left her at prayer in a chapel, and sailed
without her. 57 At Rome he taught rhetoric for a year; but the students
cheated him of his fees, and he applied for a professorship at Milan.
Symmachus examined him, approved, and sent him to Milan by state post.
There his brave mother overtook him,</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>and persuaded him to listen with her to the sermons of Ambrose. He
was moved by them, but even more by the hymns the congregation sang. At
the same time Monica won him over to the idea of marriage, and in effect
be- trothed him, now thirty-two, to a girl with more money than years.
Augus- tine agreed to wait two years till she should be twelve. As a
preliminary he sent his mistress back to Africa, where she buried her
grief in a nunnery. A few weeks of continence unnerved him, and instead
of marrying he took an- other concubine. “Give me chastity,” he prayed,
“but not yet!” 68</p>
<p>Amid these diversions he found time for theology. He had begun with
his mother’s simple faith, but had cast it off proudly at school. For
nine years (374-83) he accepted Manichean dualism as the most
satisfactory explana- tion of a world so indifferently compounded of
evil and good. For a time he flirted with the skepticism of the later
Academy; but he was too emotional to remain long in suspended judgment.
At Rome and Milan he studied Plato and Plotinus; Neoplatonism entered
deeply into his philosophy, and, through him, dominated Christian
theology till Abelard. It became for Augustine the vestibule to
Christianity. Ambrose had recommended him to read the Bible in the light
of Paul’s statement that “the letter killeth but the spirit maketh</p>
<p>On Easter Sunday of 387 Augustine, Alypius, and Adeodatus were bap-
tized by Ambrose, with Monica standing happily by. All four resolved to
go to Africa and live a monastic life. At Ostia Monica died, confident
of re- union in paradise. Arrived in Africa, Augustine sold his modest
patrimony and gave the proceeds to the poor. Then he and Alypius and
some friends formed a religious community, and lived at Tagaste in
poverty, celibacy, study, and prayer. So was founded (388) the
Augustinian order, the oldest monastic fraternity in the West.</p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Theologian</li>
</ol>
<p>In 389 Adeodatus passed away, and Augustine mourned him as bitterly
as if still uncertain of the eternal bliss awaiting those who died in
Christ. Work and writing were his only consolations. In 391 Valerius,
Bishop of near-by Hippo (now Bone) , asked his aid in administering the
diocese, and for this purpose ordained him a priest. Valerius often
yielded the pulpit to him, and Augustine’s eloquence impressed the
congregation even when they could not understand him. Hippo was a
seaport of some 40,000 population; the Catho- lics had one church there,
the Donatists another; the remainder of the people were Manicheans or
pagans. TheManichean bishop, Fortunatus, had hitherto dominated the
theological scene; Donatists joined Catholics in urging Au- gustine to
meet him in debate; he consented; and for two days these novel
gladiators crossed words before a crowd that filled the Baths of Sosius.
Au- gustine won; Fortunatus left Hippo, and never returned (392).</p>
<p>Four years later Valerius, alleging his age, asked the congregation
to choose his successor. Augustine was unanimously elected; and though
he protested and wept, and begged the privilege of returning to his
monastery, he was prevailed upon, and for the remaining thirty-four
years of his life he was Bishop of Hippo; from this foot of earth he
moved the world. He chose one or two deacons, and brought two monks from
his monastery to help him; they lived monastically and communistically
in the episcopal rectory; Au- gustine was a bit puzzled to understand
how one of his aides, at death, could leave a tidy legacy. 59 All
subsisted on a vegetarian diet, reserving meat for guests and the sick.
Augustine himself is described as short and thin, and never strong; he
complained of a lung disorder, and suffered unduly from the cold. He was
a man of sensitive nerves, easily excited, of keen and some- what morbid
imagination, of subtle and flexible intellect. Despite a tenacious
dogmatism and some occasional intolerance, he must have had many lovable
qualities; several men who came to learn rhetoric from him accepted his
lead into Christianity; and Alypius followed him to the end.</p>
<p>He had hardly taken his seat as bishop when he began a lifelong war
against the Donatists. He challenged their leaders to public debate, but
few cared to accept; he invited them to friendly conferences, but was
met first with silence, then with insult, then with violence; several
Catholic bishops in North Africa were assaulted, and some attempts seem
to have been made upon the life of Augustine himself; 60 however, we do
not have the Donatist side of this story. In 41 1 a council called by
the Emperor Honorius met at Carthage to quiet the Donatist dispute; the
Donatists sent 279 bishops, the Catholics 286 — but bishop in Africa
meant little more than parish priest. The Emperor’s legate, Marcellinus,
after hearing both sides, decreed that the Don - atists must hold no
further meetings, and must hand over all their churches</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>o the Catholics. The Donatists replied with acts of desperate
violence, in- cluding, we are told, the murder of Restitutus, a priest
of Hippo, and the mutilation of another member of Augustine’s staff.
Augu stine urged the gov- ernment to enforce its decree vigorously ; 61
he retracted his earlier view that “no one should be coerced into the
unity of Christ… that we must fight only by arguments, and prevail only
by force of reason”; 02 he concluded t hat the Church, being the
spiritual father of all, should have a parent’s right to chas - tise an
unruly son for his own good ; 63 it seemed to him better that a few
Donatists should suffer “than that all should be damned for want of co -
ercion.” 64 At the same time he pled repeatedly with the state officials
not to</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Aside from this bitter contest, and the cares of his see, Augustine
lived in the Country of the Mind, and labored chiefly with his pen.
Almost every day he wrote a letter whose influence is still active in
Catholic theology. His ser- mons alone fill volumes; and though some are
spoiled by an artificial rhetoric of opposed and balanced clauses, and
many deal with local and transient topics in a simple style adapted to
his unlettered congregation, many of them rise to a noble eloquence born
of mystic passion and profound belief. His busy mind, trained in the
logic of the schools, could not be confined within the issues of his
parish. In treatise after treatise he labored to reconcile with reason
the doctrines of the Church that he had come to revere as the one pillar
of order and decency in a ruined and riotous world. He knew that the
Trinity was a stumbling block to the intellect; for fifteen years he
worked on his most systematic production — De Trinitate — struggling to
find analo- gies in human experience for three persons in one God. More
puzzling still- filling all Augustine’s life with wonder and debate— was
the problem of harmonizing the free will of man with the foreknowledge
of God. If God is omniscient He sees the future in all details; since
God is immutable, this pic- ture that He has of all coming events lays
upon them the necessity of occur- ring as He has foreseen them; they are
irrevocably predestined. Then how can man be free? Must he not do what
God has foreseen? And if God has foreseen all things, He has known from
all eternity the final fate of every soul that He creates; why, then,
should He create those that are predestined to be damned?</p>
<p>In his first years as a Christian Augustine had written a treatise De
libero ar bitrio (On Free Will). He had sought then to square the
existence of evil with the benevolence of an omnipotent God; and his
answer was that evil is the result of free will: God could not leave man
free without giving him the possibility of doing wrong as well as right.
Later, under the influence of Paul’s epistles, he argued that Adam’s sin
had left upon the human race a stain of evil inclination; that no amount
of good works, but only the freely given grace of God, could enable the
soul to overcome this inclination, erase this stain, and achieve
salvation. God offered this grace to all, but many re-</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 69</p>
<p>fused it. God knew that they would refuse it; but this possibility of
damna- tion was the price of that moral freedom without which man would
not be man. The divine foreknowledge does not destroy this freedom; God
merely foresees the choices that man will freely make. 66</p>
<p>Augustine did not invent the doctrine of original sin; Paul,
Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose had taught it; but his own experience of
sin, and of the ’Voice” that had converted him, had left in him a somber
conviction that the human will is from birth inclined to evil, and can
be turned to good only by the gratuitous act of God. He could not
explain the evil inclination of the will except as an effect of Eve’s
sin and Adam’s love. Since we are all children of Adam, Augustine
argued, we share his guilt, are, indeed, the offspring of his guilt: the
original sin was concupiscence. And concupiscence still befouls every
act of generation; by the very connection of sex with parentage man-
kind is a “mass of perdition,” and most of us will be damned. Some of us
will be saved, but only through the grace of the suffering Son of God,
and through the intercession of the Mother who conceived Him sinlessly.
“Through a woman we were sent to destruction; through a woman salvation
was restored to us.” 67</p>
<p>Writing so much and so hurriedly — often, it appears, by dictation to
amanuenses — Augustine fell more than once into exaggerations which
later he strove to modify. At times he propounded the Calvinistic
doctrine that God arbitrarily chose, from all eternity, the “elect” to
whom He would give His saving grace. 68 A crowd of critics rose to
plague him for such theories; he conceded nothing, but fought every
point to the end. From England came his ablest* opponent, the footloose
monk Pelagius, with a strong defense of ma n’s freedom, and of the
saving power of good works. God indeed helps us, said Pelagius, by
giving us His law and commandments, by the example and precepts of His
saints, by the cleansing waters of baptism, and the redeeming blood of
Christ. But God does not tip the scales against our salvation by mak-
ing human nature inherently evil. There was no original sin, no fall of
man; only he who commits a sin is punished for it; it transmits no guilt
to his progeny. 60 God does not predestine man to heaven or hell, does
not choose arbitrarily whom He will damn or save; He leaves the choice
of our fate to ourselves. The theory of innate human depravity, said
Pelagius, was a cow- ardly shifting to God of the blame for man’s sins.
Man feels, and therefore is, responsible; “if I ought, I can.”</p>
<p>Pelagius came to Rome about 400, lived with pious families, and
earned a reputation for virtue. In 409 he fled from Alaric, first to
Carthage, then to Palestine. There he dwelt in peace till the Spanish
priest Orosius came from Augustine to warn Jerome against him (415). An
Eastern synod tried the monk, and declared him orthodox; an African
synod, prodded by Augustine, repudiated this finding, and appealed to
Pope Innocent I, who declared Pe- lagius a heretic; whe reupon Augustine
hopefully announced, “Causa finita</p>
<p>70 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>est ” (The case is finished). 70 * But Innocent, dying, was succeeded
by Zosi - mus, who pronounced Pelagius guiltless. The African bishops
appealed to Honorius; the Emperor was pleased to correct the Pope;
Zosimus yielded (418); and the Council of Ephesus (431) condemned as a
heresy the Pe- lagian view that man can be good without the helping
grace cf God.</p>
<p>Augustine could be caught in contradictions and absurdities, even in
mor- bid cruelties of thought; but he could not be overcome, because in
the end his own soul’s adventures, and the passion of his nature, not
any chain of rea - soning, molded his theology. He knew the weakness of
the intellect: it was the in dividual’s brief experience sitting in
reckless judgment upon the experi - ence of the race; and how could
forty years understand forty centuries? “Dispute not by excited
argument,” he wrote to a friend, “those things which you do not yet
comprehend, or those which in the Scriptures ap- pear… to be incongruous
and contradictory; meekly defer the day of your understanding.” 71 Faith
must precede understanding. “Seek not to under - stand that you may
believe, but believe that you may understand”— crede ut intelligas? 2
“The authority of the Scriptures is higher than all the efforts of the
human intelligence.” 73 The Bible, however, need not always be taken
literally; it was written to be intelligible to simple minds, and had to
use cor- poreal terms for spiritual realities. 74 When interpretations
differ we must rest in the decision of the Church councils, in the
collective wisdom of her wisest men. 75</p>
<p>But even faith is not enough for understanding; there must be a clean
heart to let in the rays of the divinity that surrounds us. So humbled
and cleansed, one may, after many years, rise to the real end and
essence of religion, which is “the possession of die living God.” “I
desire to know God and the soul. Nothing more? Nothing whatever.” 70 O
riental Christianity spoke mostly of Christ; Augustine’s theology is “of
the First Person”; it is of and to God the</p>
<p>We need not believe, says Augustine, that the world was created in
six “days”; probably God in the beginning created only a nebulous mass (
nebu - losa species ) ; but in this mass lay the seminal order, or
productive capacities (rationes seminales), from which all things would
develop by natural causes. 81 For Augustine, as for Plato, the actual
objects and events of this</p>

<p>How shall we do justice so briefly to so powerful a personality, and
so fertile a pen? Through 2 30 treatises he spoke his mind on almost
every prob- lem of theology and philosophy, and usually in a style warm
with feeling and bright with new-coined phrases from his copious mint.
He discussed with diffi dence and subtlety the nature of time. 83 He
anticipated Descartes’ “ Cogito , ergo sum”* to refute the Academics,
who denied that man can be certain of anything, he argued: “Who doubts
that he lives and thinks?… For if he doubts, he lives.” 84 He presaged
Bergson’s complaint that the intel - lect, through long dealing with
corporeal things, is a constitutional material- ist; he proclaimed, like
Kant, that the soul is the most directly known of all realities, and
clearly stated the idealistic position — that since matter is known only
through mind, we cannot logically reduce mind to matter. 85 He sug-
gested the Schopenhauerian thesis that will, not intellect, is
fundamental in man; and he agreed with Schopenhauer that the world would
be improved if all reproduction should cease. 88</p>
<p>Two of his works belong to the classics of the world’s literature.
The Concessions ( c. 400) is the first and most famous of all
autobiographies. It is addressed directly to God, as a ioo,ooo-word act
of contrition. It begins with the sins of his youth, tells vividly the
story of his conversion, and occasionally bursts into a rhapsody of
prayer. All confessions are camouflage, but there was in this one a
sincerity that shocked the world. Even as Augustine wrote it — forty-six
and a bishop — the old carnal ideas “still live in my memory and rush
into my thoughts;… in sleep they come upon me not to delight only, but
even so far as consent, and most like to the deed”; 87 bishops are not
always so psychoanalytically frank. His masterpiece is the moving story
of how one soul came to faith and peace, and its first lines are its
summary: “Thou hast</p>
<p>Too late I came to love Thee, O Thou Beauty both so ancient and</p>
<p>so fresh…. Yea, also the heaven and the earth, and all that is in
them, bid me on everv side that I should love Thee…. What now do I love

<p>The Confessions is poetry in prose; the City of God (41 3-26) is
philoso- phy in history. When the news of Alaric’s sack of Rome reached
Africa, followed by thousands of desolate refugees, Augustine was
stirred, like Jerome and others, by what seemed an irrational and
Satanic calamity. Why should the city whose beauty and power men had
built and reverenced through centuries, and now the citadel of
Christendom, be surrendered by a benevolent deity to the ravages of
barbarians? Pagans everywhere attrib- uted the disaster to Christianity:
the ancient gods, plundered, dethroned, and proscribed, had withdrawn
their protection from the Rome that under their guidance had grown and
prospered for a thousand years. Many Christians were shaken in their
faith. Augustine felt the challenge deeply; all his vast temple of
theology threatened to collapse if this panic of fear were not al-
layed. He resolved to devote all the powers of his genius to convincing
the Roman world that such catastrophes did not for a moment impugn
Chris- tianity. For thirteen years he labored on his book, amid a press
of obligations and distractions. He published it in piecemeal
installments; the middle of it forgot the beginning and did not foresee
the end; inevitably its 1200 pages became a confused concatenation of
essays on everything from the First Sin to the Last Judgment; and only
the depth of its thought, and the splendor of its style, lifted it out
of its chaos to the highest rank in the literature of Christian
philosophy.</p>
<p>Augustine’s initial answer was that Rome had been punished not for
her new religion but for her continued sins. He described the indecency
of the pagan stage, and quoted Sallust and Cicero on the corruption of
Roman poli- tics. Once Rome had been a nation of stoics, strengthened by
Catos and Scipios; she had almost created law, and had given order and
peace to half the world; in those heroic days God had made His face to
shine upon her. But the seeds of moral decay lay in the very religion of
ancient.Rome, in gods who encouraged, rather than checked, the sexual
nature of man: “the god Virgineus to loose the virgin’s girdle, Subigus
to place her under the man, Prema to press her down… Priapus upon whose
huge and beastly member the new bride was commanded by religious order
to get up and sit!” 89 Rome was punished because she worshiped, not
because she neg - lected, such deities. The barbarians spared Christian
churches and those who</p>

<p>fled to them, but showed no mercy to the remnants of pagan shrines;
how, then, could the invaders be the agents of a pagan revenge?</p>
<p>Augustine’s second answer was a philosophy of history— an attempt to
ex- plain the events of recorded time on one universal principle. From
Plato’s conception of an ideal state existing “somewhere in heaven,”
from St. Paul’s thought of a community of saints living and dead, 90
from the Donatist Ty- conius’ doctrine of two societies, one of God and
one of Satan, 91 Augus - tine took the basic idea of his book as a tale
of two cities: the earthly city of worldly men devoted to earthly
affairs and joys; and the divine city of the past, present, and future
worshipers of the one true God. Marcus Aurelius had provided a noble
phrase: “The poet could say of Athens, Thou lovely city of Cecrops; and
shalt not thou say of the world, Thou lovely city of God?” 92 — but
Aurelius had meant by this the whole orderly universe. The civitas Dei,
says Augustine, was founded by the creation of the angels; the civitas
terrena by the rebellion of Satan. “Mankind is divided into two sorts:
such as live according to man, and such as live according to God. These
we mystically call the ‘two cities’ or societies, the one predestined to
reign eter - nally with God, the other condemned to perpetual torment
with the Devil.” 93 An actual city or empire need not in all a spects be
confined within the Earthly City; it may do good things — legislate
wisely, judge justly, and aid the Church; and these good actions take
place, so to speak, within the City of God. This spiritual city, again,
is not identical with the Catholic Church; the Church too may have
terrestrial interests, and its members may fall into self-seeking and
sin, slipping from one city into the other. Only at the Last Judgment
will the two cities be separate and distinct. 94</p>
<p>By a symbolic extension of her membership to heavenly as well as to
earthly souls, to pre-Christian as well as Christian righteous men, the
Church may be — and by Augustine occasionally is — identified with the
City of God. 95 The Church would later accept this identification as an
ideological weapon of politics, and would logically deduce from
Augustine’s philosophy the doctrine of a theocratic state, in which the
secular powers, derived from men, would be subordinate to the spiritual
power held by the Church and derived from God. With this book paganism
as a philosophy ceased to be, and Christianity as a philosophy began. It
was the first definitive formulation of the medieval mind.</p>

<p>The old lion of the faith was still at his post when the Vandals
came. To the end he remained in the theological arena, felling new
heresies, countering critics, answering objections, resolving
difficulties. He considered gravely whether woman will retain her sex in
the next world; whether the deformed and the mutilated, the thin and the
fat, will be reborn as they were; and how</p>

<p>He had done his best to deter Boniface from rebellion against Rome,
and had shared in recalling him to loyalty. As Gaiseric advanced, many
bishops and priests asked Augustine should they stay at their posts or
flee; he bade them stay, and gave example. When the Vandals laid siege
to Hippo, Augus- tine maintained the morale of the starving people by
his sermons and his prayers. In the third month of the siege he died,
aged seventy-six. He left no will, having no goods; but he had written
his own epitaph: “What maketh</p>
<p>Few men in history have had such influence. Eastern Christianity
never took to him, partly because he was thoroughly un-Greelc in his
limited learn- ing and in his subordination of thought to feeling and
will; partly because the Eastern Church had already submitted to the
state. But in the West he gave a definitive stamp to Catholic theology.
Anticipating and inspiring Gregory VII and Innocent III, he formulated
the claim of the Church to supremacy over the mind and the state; and
the great battles of popes against emperors and kings were political
corollaries of his thought. Until the thirteenth cen- tury he dominated
Catholic philosophy, giving it a Neoplatonic tinge; and even Aquinas the
Aristotelian often followed his lead. Wyclif, Huss, and Luther believed
they were returning to Augustine when they left the Church; and Calvin
based his ruthless creed upon Augustine’s theories of the elect and the
damned. At the same time that he stimulated men of intellect, he became
an inspiration to those whose Christianity was more of the heart than of
the head; mystics tried to retrace his steps in seeking a vision of God;
and men and women found food and phrases for their piety in the humility
and tenderness of his prayers. It may be the secret of his influence
that he united and strengthened both the philosophical and the mystical
strains in Christianity, and opened a path not only for Thomas Aquinas
but for Thomas a Kempis as well.</p>
<p>His subjective, emotional, anti-intellectual emphasis marked the end
of classical, the triumph of medieval, literature. To understand the
Middle Ages we must forget our modern rationalism, our proud confidence
in reason and science, our restless search after wealth and power and an
earthly para- dise; we must enter sympathetically into the mood of men
disillusioned of these pursuits, standing at the end of a thousand years
of rationalism, finding all dreams of utopia shattered by war and
poverty and barbarism, seeking consolation in the hope of happiness
beyond the grave, inspired and com- forted by the story and figure of
Christ, throwing themselves upon the</p>

pres- ence, His inescapable judgment, and the atoning death of His Son.
St. Aug- ustine above all others, and even in the age of Symmachus,
Claudian, and Ausonius, reveals and phrases this mood. He is the most
authentic, eloquent, and powerful voice of the Age of Faith in
Christendom.</p>

<li>THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD</li>
</ol>
<p>Augustine’s argument against paganism was the last rebuttal in the
great - est of historic debates. Paganism survived in the moral sense,
as a joyous in- dulgence of natural appetites; as a religion it remained
only in the form of ancient rites and customs condoned, or accepted and
transformed, by an often indulgent Church. An intimate and trustful
worship of saints replaced the cult of the pagan gods, and satisfied the
congenial polytheism of simple or poetic minds. Statues of Isis and
Horus were renamed Mary and Jesus; the Roman Lupercalia and the feast of
the purification of Isis became the Feast of the Nativity ; 99 the
Saturnalia were replaced by Christmas celebrations, the Floralia by
Pentecost, an ancient festival of the dead by All Souls’ Day , 100 the
resurrection of Attis by the resurrection of Christ. 101 Pagan altars
were rededicated to Christian heroes; incense, lights, flowers,
processions, vest- ments, hymns, which had pleased the people in older
cults were domesticated and cleansed in the ritual of the Church; and
the harsh slaughter of a living victim was sublimated in the spiritual
sacrifice of the Mass.</p>
<p>Augustine had protested against the adoration of saints, and in terms
that Voltaire might have used in dedicating his chapel at Ferney: “Let
us not treat the saints as gods; we do not wish to imitate those pagans
who adore the dead. Let us not build them temples, nor raise altars to
them; but with their relics let us raise an altar to the one god.” 102
The Church, however, wisely accepted the inevitable anthropomorphism of
popular theology. She resisted , 103 then used, then abused, the cult of
martyrs and relics. She opposed the worship of images and icons, and
warned her faithful that these should be reverenced only as symbols ;
104 but the ardor of public feeling overcame these cautions, and led to
the excesses that aroused the Byzantine iconoclasts. The Church
denounced magic, astrology, and divination, but medieval, like ancient,
literature, was full of them; soon people and priests would use the sign
of the cross as a magic incantation to expel or drive away demons. Exor-
cisms were pronounced over the candidate for baptism, and total nude im-
mersion was required lest a devil should hide in some clothing or orna-
ment. 105 The dream cures once sought in the temples of Aesculapius
could now be obtained in the sanctuary of Sts. Cosmas and Damian in
Rome, and would soon be available at a hundred shrines. In such matters
it was not the priests who corrupted the people, but the people who
persuaded the priests.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>?6</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>The soul of the simple man can be moved only through the senses and
the imagination, by ceremony and miracle, by myth and fear and hope; he
will reject or transform any religion that does not give him these. It
was natural that amid war and desolation, poverty and disease, a
frightened people should find refuge and solace in chapels, churches,
and cathedrals, in mystic lights and rejoicing bells, in processions,
festivals, and colorful ritual.</p>
<p>By yielding to these popular necessities the Church was enabled to
incul- cate a new morality. Ambrose, always the Roman administrator, had
tried to formulate the ethics of Christianity in Stoic terms, converting
Cicero to his needs; and in the greater Christians of the Middle Ages,
from Augustine to Savonarola, the Stoic ideal of self-control and
uncompromising virtue in- formed the Christian mold. But that masculine
morality was not the ideal of the people. They had had Stoics long
enough; they had seen the masculine virtues incarnadine half the world;
they longed for gentler, quieter ways, by which men might be persuaded
to live in stability and peace. For the first time in European history
the teachers of mankind preached an ethic of kind- liness, obedience,
humility, patience, mercy, purity, chastity, and tenderness — virtues
perhaps derived from the lowly social origins of the Church, and their
popularity among women, but admirably adapted to restore order to a
de-moral-ized people, to tame the marauding barbarian, to moderate the
vio- lence of a falling world.</p>
<p>The reforms of the Church were greatest in the realm of sex. Paganism
had tolerated the prostitute as a necessary mitigation of an arduous
monogamy; the Church denounced prostitution without compromise, and
demanded a single standard of fidelity for both sexes in marriage. She
did* not quite suc- ceed; she raised the morals of the home, but
prostitution remained, driven into stealth and degradation. Perhaps to
counterbalance a sexual instinct that had run wild, the new morality
exaggerated chastity into an obsession, and subordinated marriage and
parentage to a lifelong virginity or celibacy as an ideal; and it took
the Fathers of the Church some time to realize that no so- ciety could
survive on such sterile principles. But this puritanic reaction can be
understood if we recall the licentiousness of the Roman stage, the
schools of prostitution in some Greek and Oriental temples, the
widespread abortion and infanticide, the obscene paintings on Pompeian
walls, the unnatural vice so popular in Greece and Rome, the excesses of
the early emperors, the sensuality of the upper classes as revealed in
Catullus and Martial, Tacitus and Juvenal. The Church finally reached a
healthier view, and indeed came in time to take a lenient attitude to
sins of the flesh. Meanwhile some injury was done to the conception of
parentage and the family. Too many Chris- tians of these early centuries
thought that they could serve God best — or, rather, most easily escape
hell — by abandoning their parents, mates, or chil- dren, and fleeing
from the responsibilities of life in the frightened pursuit of a
selfishly individual salvation. In paganism the family had been the
social</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 77</p>
<p>and religious unit; it was a loss that in medieval Christianity this
unit became the individual.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Church strengthened the family by surrounding mar-
riage with solemn ceremony, and exalting it from a contract to a
sacrament. By making matrimony indissoluble she raised the security and
dignity of the wife, and encouraged the patience that comes from
hopelessness. For a time the status of woman was hurt by the doctrine of
some Christian Fathers that woman was the origin of sin and the
instrument of Satan; but some amends were made by the honors paid to the
Mother of God. Having accepted mar- riage, the Church blessed abundant
motherhood, and sternly forbade abor- tion or infanticide; perhaps it
was to discourage these practices that her theo- logians damned to a
limbo of eternal darkness any child that died without baptism. It was
through the influence of the Church that Valentinian I, in 374, made
infanticide a capital crime.</p>
<p>The Church did not condemn slavery. Orthodox and heretic, Roman and
barbarian alike assumed the institution to be natural and
indestructible; a few philosophers protested, but they too had slaves.
The legislation of the Christian emperors in this matter does not
compare favorably with the laws of Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius.
Pagan laws condemned to slavery any free woman who married a slave; the
laws of Constantine ordered the woman to be executed, and the slave to
be burned alive. The Emperor Gra- tian decreed that a slave who accused
his master of any offense except high treason to the state should be
burned alive at once, without inquiry into the justice of the charge.
106 But though the Church accepted slavery as part of the law of war,
she did more than any other institution of the time to mitigate the
evils of servitude. She proclaimed, through the Fathers, the principle
that all men are by nature equal — presumably meaning in legal and moral
rights; she practiced the principle in so far as she received into her
communion all ranks and classes: though no slave could be ordained to
the priesthood, the poorest freedman could rise to high places in the
ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Church repudiated the distinction made in
pagan law between wrongs done to a freeman and those done to a slave.
She encouraged manumission, made emancipation of slaves a mode of
expiating sins, or of celebrating some good fortune, or of approaching
the judgment seat of God. She spent great sums freeing from slavery
Christians captured in war. 107 Nevertheless slavery continued
throughout the Middle Ages, and died without benefit of clergy.</p>
<p>The outstanding moral distinction of the Church was her extensive
pro- vision of charity. The pagan emperors had provided state funds for
poor families, and pagan magnates had done something for their “clients”
and the poor. But never had the world seen such a dispensation of alms
as was now organized by the Church. She encouraged bequests to the poor,
to be administered by her; some abuses and malversation crept in, but
that the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>Church carried out her obligations abundantly is attested by the
jealous emu- lation of Julian. She helped widows, orphans, the sick or
infirm, prisoners, victims of natural catastrophes; and she frequently
intervened to protect the lower orders from unusual exploitation or
excessive taxation. 308 In many cases priests, on attaining the
episcopacy, gave all their property to the poor. Chris- tian women
like,Fabiola, Paula, and Melania devoted fortunes to charitable work.
Following the example of pagan valetudinaria, the Church or her rich
laymen founded public hospitals on a scale never known before. Basil
estab- lished a famous hospital, and the first asylum for lepers, at
Caesarea in Cappa- docia. Xenodochia — refuges for wayfarers — rose
along pilgrim routes; the Council of Nicaea ordered that one should be
provided in every city.Widows were enlisted to distribute charity, and
found in this work a new significance for their lonely lives. Pagans
admired the steadfastness of Christians in caring for the sick in cities
stricken with famine or pestilence. 100</p>
<p>What did the Church do in these centuries for the minds of men? As
Roman schools still existed, she did not feel it her function to promote
in- tellectual development. She exalted feeling above intellect; in this
sense Christianity was a “romantic” reaction against the “classic” trust
in reason; Rousseau was merely a lesser Augustine. Convinced that
survival demanded organization, that organization required agreement on
basic principles and beliefs, and that the vast majority of her
adherents longed for authoritatively established beliefs, the Church
defined her creed in unchangeable dogmas, made doubt a sin, and entered
upon an unending conflict with the fluent intellect and changeable ideas
of men. She claimed that through divine revela- tion she had found the
answers to the old problems of origin, nature, and destiny; “we who are
instructed in the knowledge of truth by the Holy Scriptures,” wrote
Lactantius (307), “know the beginning of the worl d and its end.” 110
Tertullian had said as much a century before (197), and had sug - gested
a cloture on philosophy. 111 Having displaced the axis of man’s concern
from this world to the next, Christianity offered supernatural
explanations for historical events, and thereby passively discouraged
the investigation of natural causes; many of the advances made by Greek
science through seven centuries were sacrificed to the cosmology and
biology of Genesis.</p>
<p>Did Christianity bring a literary decline? Most of the Fathers were
hostile to pagan literature, as permeated with a demonic polytheism and
a degrading immorality; but the greatest of the Fathers loved the
classics notwithstanding, and Christians like Fortunatus, Prudentius,
Jerome, Sidonius, and Ausonius aspired to write verse like Virgil’s or
prose like Cicero’s. Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and
Augustine outweigh, even in a literary sense, their pagan contemporaries
— Ammianus, Symmachus, Claudian, Julian. But after Augustine prose style
decayed; written Latin took over the rough vocabulary and careless
syntax of the popular speech; and Latin verse for a</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) THE PROGRESS OF CHRISTIANITY 79</p>
<p>ime deteriorated into doggerel before molding new forms into majestic
hymns.</p>
<p>The basic cause of cultural retrogression was not Christianity but
barbar- ism; not religion but war. The human inundations ruined or
impoverished cities, monasteries, libraries, schools, and made
impossible the life of the scholar or the scientist. Perhaps the
destruction would have been worse had not fhe Church maintained some
measure of order in a crumbling civiliza- tion. “Amid the agitations of
the world,” said Ambrose, “the Church remains unmoved; the waves cannot
shake her. While around her everything is in a horrible chaos, she
offers to all the shipwrecked a tranquil port where they will find
safety.” 112 And often it was so.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire had raised science, prosperity, and power to their
ancient peaks. The decay of the Empire in the West, the growth of
poverty and the spread of violence, necessitated some new ideal and hope
to give men consolation in their suffering and courage in their toil: an
age of power gave way to an age of faith. Not till wealth and pride
should return in the Renais- sance would reason reject faith, and
abandon heaven for utopia. But if, there- after, reason should fail, and
science should find no answers, but should multiply knowledge and power
without improving conscience or purpose; if all utopias should brutally
collapse in the changeless abuse of the weak by the strong: then men
would understand why once their ancestors, in the barbarism of those
early Christian centuries, turned from science, knowl- edge, power, and
pride, and took refuge for a thousand years in humble faith, hope, and
charity.</p>
