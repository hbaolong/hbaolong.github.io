<p>XFerrara</p>
<p>1378-1534</p>
<p>I. THE HOUSE OF ESTE</p>
<p>I N the first quarter of the sixteenth century the most active
centers of the Renaissance were Ferrara, Venice, and Rome. The student
who</p>
<p>wanders through Ferrara today can hardly believe — until he enters
the mighty Castello — that this slumbering city was once the home of a
powerful dynasty, whose court was the most splendid in Europe, and whose
pension- ers included the greatest poet of the time.</p>
<p>The city owed its existence partly to its position on the route of
com- merce between Bologna and Venice, partly to the agricultural
hinterland that used it as a mart and was itself enriched by three
branches of the Po. It was included in the territory given to the papacy
by Pepin III (756) and Charlemagne (773), and was again deeded to the
Church by the Countess Matilda of Tuscany (1 107). While formally
acknowledging itself to be a papal fief it governed itself as an
independent commune, dominated by rival mercantile families. Disordered
by these feuds it accepted Count Azzo VI of Este as its podesta ( 1
208), and made this office hereditary in his progeny. Este was a small
Imperial fief, some forty miles north of Ferrara, which had been given
to Count Azzo I of Canossa by the Emperor Otho I (961); in 1056 it
became the seat of the family, and soon gave it its name. From this
historic house came the later royal families of Brunswick and
Hanover.</p>
<p>From 1208 to 1597 the Estensi ruled Ferrara technically as vassals of
the Empire and the papacy, but practically as independent lords, with
the title of marquis or (after 1470) duke. Under their government the
people prospered tolerably, and supplied the needs and luxuries of a
court that entertained emperors and popes, and supported a notable
retinue of schol- ars, artists, poets, and priests. Despite lawless
cruelties and frequent wars, the Estensi retained the loyalty of their
subjects through four centuries. When a legate of Pope Clement V
expelled the Estensi and proclaimed Ferrara a papal state (13 11), the
people found ecclesiastical rule more irksome than secular exploitation;
they drove out the legate, and restored</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>262 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthe Estensi to power (1317). Pope John XXII laid an interdict upon
the city; soon the people, deprived of the sacraments, began to murmur.
The Estensi sought reconciliation with the Church, and obtained it on
hard conditions: they acknowledged Ferrara to be a papal fief, which
they would rule as vicars of the popes; and they pledged themselves and
their successors to pay, from the revenues of the state, an annual
tribute of 10,000 ducats (50,000?) to the papacy. 1</p>
<p>During the long rule (1393-1441) of Niccolo III the house of Este</p>
<p>reached the acme of its power, governing not only Ferrara but also
Rovigo, Modena, Reggio, Parma, and even, briefly, Milan. Niccolo married
as widely as he ruled, having a long succession of wives and mistresses.
One especially pretty and popular wife, Parisina Malatesta, committed
adultery with her stepson Ugo; Niccolo had them both beheaded (1425),
and or- dered that all Farrarese women convicted of adultery should be
put to death. When it became clear that this edict threatened to
depopulate Fer- rara, it was no longer enforced. For the rest Niccolo
ruled well. He re- duced taxes, encouraged industry and commerce,
summoned Theodoras Gaza to teach Greek in the university, and engaged
Guarino da Verona to establish at Ferrara a school rivaling in fame and
result the school of Vittorino da Feltre at Mantua.</p>
<p>Nicco lo’s son Leonello (1441 -50) was a rare phenomenon — a ruler
both gentle and virile, refined and competent, intellectual and
practical. Trained in all the arts of war, he cherished peace, and
became the favored arbiter and peacemaker among his fellow rulers in
Italy. Taught letters and litera- ture by Guarino, he became — a
generation before Lorenzo de’ Medici— one of the most cultivated men of
the age; the learned Filelfo was astonished by Leonello’s mastery of
Latin and Greek, rhetoric and poetry, phil osophy and law. This Marquis
was the scholar who first suggested that the sup- posed letters of
St. Paul to Seneca were spurious. 2 He established a public library,
provided fresh funds and inspiration for the University of Ferrara,
brought to its staff the best scholars that he could find, and
participated actively in their discussions. No scandal or bloodshed or
tragedy marred his reign, except its tragic brevity. When he died at
forty, all Italy</p>
<p>mourned.</p>
<p>A succession of able rulers continued the Golden Age that Leonello
had begun. His brother Borso (1450-71) was a man of sterner stuff, but
he maintained the policy of peace, and Ferrara’s prosperity became the
envy of other states. He did not care for literature or art, yet he
supported them amply. He administered his realm with skill and
comparative justice, but</p>
<p>FERRARA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>he taxed his people heavily, and spent much of their substance on
court pageants and displays. He loved rank and title, and longed to be a
duke like the Visconti of Milan; by expensive gifts he persuaded the
Emperor Frederick III to invest him with the dignity of Duke of Modena
and Reggio (1452), and marked the occasion with a costly festival.
Nineteen years later he secured from his other feudal lord, Pope Paul
II, the title of Duke of Ferrara. His fame spread throughout the
Mediterranean world; the Moslem sovereigns of Babylonia and Tunis sent
him gifts, presuming him to be the greatest ruler in Italy.</p>
<p>Borso was fortunate in his brothers: Leonello, who had given him the
best of examples; and Ercole, who had refused to sanction a conspiracy
to depose him, had remained his loyal aide to the end, and now succeeded
to his power. For six years Ercole continued the reign of peace,
pageantry, poetry, art, and taxation. He cemented friendship with Naples
by marry- ing King Ferrante’s daughter Eleonora of Aragon, and welcomed
her with the most lavish festivities that Ferrara had ever seen (1473).
But in 1478, when SLxtus IV declared war on Florence because of its
punishment of the Pazzi conspirators, Ercole joined Florence and Milan
against Naples and the papacy. That war having ended, Sixtus induced
Venice to join him in attacking Ferrara ( 1482 ) . While Ercole lay sick
in bed the Venetian forces advanced to within four miles of the city;
the dispossessed peasantry crowded within the gates, and joined in the
general starvation. Then the temperamental Pope, fearing that Venice,
not the papacy or his nephew, would get Ferrara, made peace with Ercole;
and the Venetians, retaining Rovigo, retired to their lagoons.</p>
<p>The fields were planted again, food came into the city, trade was re-
sumed, taxes could be gathered. Ercole complained that the fines levied
for blasphemous profanity were falling away from the normal total of
6000 crowns a year (50,000?); he could not believe that profanity was
any less popular than before; he demanded strict enforcement of the law.
3 Every penny was needed, for Ercole, perceiving that the people had
mul- tiplied beyond their housing, built an extension as large as the
older city. He had this Addizione Erculea designed with such wide
straight streets as no Italian town had known since Roman days; the new
Ferrara was “the</p>
<p>The focus of the people’s life was the twelfth -century cathedral.
The elite preferred the giant Castello that Niccolo II had built (1385)
to protect</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthe government from foreign attack or domestic revolt. Restored and
transformed through seven generations, its massive towers still dominate
the central square of the city. Below are the dungeons in which Parisina
and many others died; above are the spacious halls, adorned by Dosso
Dossi and his assistants, where duke and duchess held court, musicians
played and sang, dwarfs pranced, poets recited their verses, buffoons
put on their antic jests, male sought female, ladies and cavaliers
danced through the night, and on quieter days, in quieter rooms, dames
and lasses read romances of chivalry. Isabella and Beatrice d’Este, born
to Ercole and Eleonora in 1474 and 1475, grew up like fairy princesses
in this environment of wealth and festival, war and song and art. But a
fond grandfather lured Beatrice to Naples, a betrothed called her to
Milan; and in that same year 1490 Isabella left for Mantua. Their
departure saddened many hearts in Ferrara, but their marriages
strengthened the alliance of the Estensi with the Sforzas and Gonzagas.
Ippolito, one of several sons, was made an archbishop at eleven, a
cardinal at fourteen, and became one of the most cultured and dissolute
prelates of the age.</p>
<p>We should in fairness note again that such ecclesiastical
appointments, ignoring fitness and age, were part of the diplomatic
alliances of the time. Alexander VI, pope since 1492, was eager to
please Ercole, for he aimed at making his daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, the
duchess of Ferrara. When he proposed to Ercole that Alfonso, son and
heir of the Duke, should marry Lucrezia, Ercole received the proposal
coldly, for Lucrezia had not then the fumigated reputation that she has
now. He finally consented, but after wringing from the eager father such
concessions as made Alexander call him a haggling shopkeeper. The Pope
was to give Lucrezia a dowry of 100,000 ducats (,250,000?); the annual
tribute of Ferrara to the papacy was to be reduced from four thousand to
one hundred florins (250?); and the duchy of Ferrara was to be settled
by papal confirmation upon Alfonso and his heirs forever. Despite all
this Alfonso was reluctant, until he saw the bride. We shall see later
how he welcomed her.</p>
<p>In 1505 he succeeded to the ducal throne. He was a new type among the
Estensi. He had traveled through France, the Lowlands, and England,
studying industrial and commercial techniques. Leaving to Lucrezia the
patronage of arts and letters, he devoted himself to government,
machinery, and pottery. With his own hands he made a painted fine
majolica, and founded the best cannon of the time. He studied the art of
fortification until he was the leading authority on the subject in
Europe. He was nor-</p>
<p>FERRARA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>mally a just man; he treated Lucrezia kindly, despite her epistolary
flirta- tions; but when he dealt with external enemies or internal
revolt he gave scant play to sentiment.</p>
<p>One of Lucrezia’s ladies, Angela, charmed two of Alfonso’s brothers:
Ippolito and Giulio. In a moment of thoughtless arrogance Angela taunted
Ippolito by telling him that his whole person was worth less to her than
the eyes of his brother. The Cardinal, with a band of bravos, waylaid
Giulio, and looked on while these pierced Giulio’s eyes with stakes
(1506). Giulio appealed to Alfonso to avenge him; the Duke banished the
Cardinal, but soon allowed him to return. Stung by Alfonso’s appare nt
indifference, Giulio conspired with another brother, Ferrante, to murder
both the Duke and the Cardinal. The plot was discovered, and Giulio and
Ferrante were imprisoned in the cells of the Castello. Ferrante died
there in 1 540; Giulio was freed by Alfonso II in 1558, after fifty
years of genteel confinement; he emerged an old man, white of hair and
beard, and dressed in the fashion of half a century before. He died
shortly after his release.</p>
<p>Alfonso’s qualities were what his government needed, for Venice was
expanding into the Romagna and was plotting to absorb Ferrara; while
Julius II, the new Pope, resenting the concessions made to the Estensi
in connection with Lucrezia’s marriage, was resolved to reduce the
principal - ity to the status of an obedient and profitable fief. In
1508 Julius persuaded Alfonso to join with him and France and Spain in
subduing Venice; Al- fonso agreed because he yearned to recover Rovigo.
The Venetians con- centrated their attack upon Ferrara. Their fleet,
sailing up the Po, was destroyed by Alfonso’s concealed artillery; and
their soldiers were routed by Ferrarese troops under Cardinal Ippolito,
who enjoyed war only next to venery. When Venice seemed on the verge of
defeat, Julius, not wishing to weaken irreparably the strongest Italian
bulwark against the Turks, made peace with her, and ordered Alfonso to
do the same. Alfonso refused, and found himself at war with both his
enemy and his late ally. Reggio and Modena fell to the papal forces, and
Alfonso seemed lost. In desperation he went to Rome and asked the Pope
for terms; Julius demanded the complete abdication of the Estensi and
the absorption of Ferrara into the Papal States. When Alfonso rejected
these demands Julius tried to arrest him; Alfonso escaped, and after
three months of disguises, wanderings, and perils, reached his capital.
Julius died (1513); Alfonso retook Reggio and Modena. Leo X resumed the
war of the papacy for Ferrara; Alfonso, always improving his artillery
and shifting his diplomacy, held his own obstinately until Leo too</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xdied (1521). Pope Adrian VI gave the indomitable Duke an honorable
settlement, and Alfonso was allowed, for a spell, to turn his talents to
the arts of peace.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ARTS IN FERRARA</li>
</ol>
<p>Ferrarese culture was purely aristocratic, and its arts sedulously
served the few. The ducal family, so often at war with the papacy, had
no stronger stimulus to piety than to give a devout example to the
people. Some new churches were built, but of no memorable quality. The
cathedral received in the fifteenth century an unprepossessing
campanile, a choir in the Renaissance style, and a pretty Gothic loggia
and Virgin in its facade; non ragionam di lor&gt; ma guarda e passa. The
architects of the time, and their patrons, preferred palaces. About 1495
Biagio Rossetti designed one of the finest, the Palazzo di Lodovico il
Moro; according to a doubtful tradition Lodovico had commis- sioned it
in the thought that he might some day be driven from Milan; it was left
unfinished when he was taken to France; its cortile, with simple but
graceful arcades, is among the lesser jewels of the Renaissance.
Lovelier still was the court of the palace built for the Strozzi (1499),
and now named Bevilacqua (Drinkwater) from a later occupant. Imposing is
the Palazzo de’ Diamanti, designed by Rossetti (1492) for Duke Ercole’s
brother Sigismondo, and faced with 12,000 marble bosses whose diamond
shape gave the building its name.</p>
<p>Pleasure palaces were in fashion, and had fancy names: Belfiore,
Belriguardo, La Rotonda, Belvedere, and, above all, the summer palace of
the Estensi, the Palazzo di Schifanoia — “Skip Annoyance,” or, as
Frederick the Great would say, Sans Souci (“Without Care”). Beg un in
1391, finished by Borso about 1469, it served as one home of the court,
and as a dwelling for minor members of the ducal family. When Ferrara
declined, the palace was turned into a tobacco factory, and the murals
that Cossa, Tura, and others had painted in the main hall were covered
with calcimine. In 1840 this was removed, and seven of the twelve panels
were salvaged. They constitute a remarkable record of the costumes,
industries, pageantry, and sports of Borso’s time, strangely mingled
with personages from pagan mythology. These frescoes are the hap- piest
product of a school of painting that for half a century made Ferrara a
busy center of Italian art.</p>
<p>Ferrarese painters humbly followed the Giottesque tradition until
Niccolo III stirred the stagnant waters by bringing in foreign artists
to compete with them — Iacopo Bellini from Venice, Mantegna from Padua,
Pisanello from Verona. Leonello added stimulus by welcoming Rogier van
der Weyden (1449), who helped to turn Italian painters to the use of
oil. In the same year Piero della Francesca came from Borgo San Sepolcro
to paint murals (now lost) in the Ducal Palace. What finally formed the
Ferrara school was Cosimo Tura’s</p>
<p>FERRARA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>zealous study of Mantegna’s fre scoes at Padua, and of the techniques
taught there by Francesco Squarcione.</p>
<p>Tura became court painter to Borso (1458), made portraits of the
ducal family, shared in decorating the Schifanoia palace, and won such
acclaim that Raphael’s father ranked hi m among the leading painters of
Italy. Giovanni Santi apparently relished Cosimo’s dignified and somber
figures, his ornate ar - chitectural backgrounds, his landscapes of
fantastic rocks; but Raffaello Santi would have missed in these pictures
any element of tenderness or grace. We find those elements in Tura’s
pupil Ercole de’ Roberti, who succeeded his teacher as court painter in
1495; but this Hercules lacked power and vitality, unless we except the
Frans-Halsian Concert once ascribed to him in the London Gallery.
Francesco Cossa, the greatest of Tura’s pupils, painted in the
Schifanoia</p>
<p>Dosso Dossi revitalized it by studying in Venice in the heyday of
Giorgione (1477-15 10). Returning to Ferrara, he became the favorite
painter of Duke Alfonso I. Ariosto, his friend, ranked him and a
forgotten brother among the immortals:</p>
<p>Leonardo , Andrea Mantegna , Gian Bellino,</p>
<p>Duo Dossi, e quel ch’a par sculpe e colora</p>
<p>Michel, piu che mortale, angel divino,</p>
<p>Bastiano, Rafael, Tizian . 5</p>
<p>We can understand why Ariosto liked Dosso, who brought into his
pictures an outdoor quality almost illustrative of Ariosto’s sylvan
epic, and bathed them in the warm colors that he had borrowed from the
sumptuous Venetians. It was Dosso and his pupils who decorated the Sala
di Consiglio in the Castello with lively scenes of athletic contests in
the ancient style, for Alfonso liked athletics more than poetry. In his
later years Dosso painted with uneven hand the allegorical and
mythological scenes on the ceiling of the Sala dell’ Aurora. Here the
pagan motives rampant in Italy triumphed in a celebration of physical
beauty and sensuous life. Perhaps the decadence that now began in
Ferrarese art — due chiefly to the exhausting cost of Alfonso’s wars—
had one source in this victory of flesh over spirit; the passion and
grandeur of the old religious themes faded from a largely secular art,
leaving it predominantly decoration.</p>
<p>The most brilliant figure in this decline was Benvenuto Tisi, named
Garofalo from his native town. On two visits to Rome he became so
enamored of Raphae l’s art that, though two years his senior, he
enrolled as an assistant in</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xthe young master’s studio. When family affairs recalled him to
Ferrara he promised Raphael to return, but Alfonso and the nobility gave
him so many commissions that he could never tear himself away. He
consumed his energy, and divided his ability, in producing a multitude
of paintings, of which some seventy remain. They lack both force and
finish; and yet one Holy Family , in the Vatican, shows how even the
minor artists of the Renaissance could now and then touch greatness.</p>
<p>The painters and the architects were only a fraction of the artists
who labored to please the fortunates of Ferrara. Miniaturists produced
there, as elsewhere in that eager age, works of a delicate beauty on
which the eye rests longer and more contentedly than on many a famous
painting; the Schifanoia palace has preserved several of these gems of
illumination and calligraphy. Niccolo III brought in tapestry weavers
from Flanders; Ferrarese artists furnished designs; the patient art
flourished under Leonello and Borso; the resulting tapestries decorated
palace walls, and were lent to princes and nobles for their special
festivities. Goldsmiths were kept busy making ecclesiastical vessels and
per- sonal ornaments. Sperandio of Mantua and Pisanello of Verona made
here some of the finest medallions of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Last and least was sculpture. Cristoforo da Firenze molded the man,
Niccolo Baroncelli the horse, for a bronze statue of Niccolo III; it was
set up in 1451, two years before Donatello’s Gattamelata rose in Padua.
Beside it, in 1470, was</p>

<p>The intellectual life of Ferrara had two roots: the University,
and</p>
<p>Guarino da Verona. Founded in 1391, the University had soon closed
for lack of funds; reopened by Niccolo III, it led a half-starved
existence until Leonello (1442) reorganized and refinanced it with an
edict whose prelude deserves commemoration:</p>
<p>It is an ancient opinion, not only of the Christians but of the
Gen-</p>
<p>tiles, that the heavens, the sea, and the earth must some day perish;
in like manner, of many magnificent cities nothing but ruins leveled</p>

<p>lies in the dust and is reduced to fragments; while only the
under-</p>
<p>standing of things divine and human, which we call wisdom, is not</p>
<p>extinguished by length of years, but retains its rights in
perpetuity. 6</p>
<p>By 1474 the University had forty-five well paid professors, and the
facul- ties of astronomy, mathematics, and medicine were rivaled in
Italy only by those at Bologna and Padua.</p>
<p>Guarino, born at Verona in 1370, went to Constantinople, lived there
five years, mastered the Greek language, and returned to Venice with a
cargo of Greek manuscripts; a legend told how, when a box of these was
lost in a storm, his hair turned white overnight. He taught Greek at
Venice, where he had Vittorino da Feltre among his pupils, and then at
Verona, Padua, Bologna, and Florence, absorbing the classical
scholarship of each city in turn. He was already fifty-nine when he
accepted an invitation to Ferrara. There, as tutor to Leonello, Borso,
and Ercole, he trained three of the most enlightened rulers in
Renaissance history. As professor of Greek and rhetoric in the
University his success was the talk of Italy. So popular were his
lectures that students made their way through any rigor of winter to
wait outside the unopened doors of the room in which he was scheduled to
speak. They came not only from Italian cities, but from Hungary, Ger-
many, England, and France; and many of them went forth from his in-
struction to fill vital posts in education, law, and statesmanship. Like
Vittorino, he supported poor students out of his personal funds; he
lived in humble quarters, ate but one meal a day, and used to invite his
friends not to feasts but to fave e favole — beans and conversation. 7
He was not quite the equal of Vittorino as a moral paragon; he could pen
virulent invectives like any humanist, perhaps as a literary game; but
his thirteen children were apparently begotten on one wife, he was
temperate in every- thing but study, and he maintained health, vigor,
and mental clarity till his ninetieth year/ It was chiefly due to him
that the dukes of Ferrara sup- ported education, scholarship, and
poetry, and made their capital one of the most renowned cultural centers
in Europe.</p>
<p>The revival of antiquity brought with it a renewed acquaintance with
classic drama. Plautus, son of the people, and Terence, manumitted
darling of the aristocracy, came alive again after fifteen centuries,
and were acted on temporary stages at Florence and Rome, above all at
Ferrara. Ercole I, in particular, loved the old comedies, and spared no
revenues in producing them; one representation of the Menaechmi cost him
a thousand ducats. When Lodovico of Milan saw a performance of this play
at Ferrara he begged Ercole to send the players to repeat it at Pavia;
Ercole not only</p>
<p>270 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xsent them but went with them (1493). When Lucrezia Borgia came to
Ferrara, Ercole celebrated her hymeneals with five of Plautus’ comedies
performed by 110 actors, with lavish interludes of music and ballet.
Guarino, Ariosto, and Ercole himself translated Latin plays into
Italian, and performances were given in the vernacular. It was through
imitation of these classic comedies that Italian drama took form.
Boiardo, Ariosto, and others wrote plays for the ducal company. Ariosto
drew up plans, and Dosso Dossi painted the fixed scenery, for the first
permanent theater of Ferrara and modern Europe (1532).</p>
<p>Music and poetry also won the patronage of the court. Tito Vespasiano
Strozzi needed no ducal subsidies for his verse, for he was the scion of
a rich Florentine family. He composed in Latin ten “books” of a poem in
praise of Borso; leaving it unfinished at his death, he bequeathed to
his son Ercole the task of completing it. Ercole was well fitted for the
assignment; he wrote excellent lyrics, Latin and Italian, and a longer
poem, La caccia — The Hunt — dedicated to Lucrezia Borgia. In 1508 he
married a poetess, Barbara Torelli; thirteen days later he was found
dead near his home, his body savagely pierced with twenty-two wounds.
This is a mystery story still unsolved after four centuries. Some have
thought that Alfonso had approached Barbara, had been repulsed, and
revenged himself by hiring assassins to kill his successful rival. It is
unlikely, for Alfonso, as long as Lucrezia lived, showed her every sign
of fidelity. The desolate young widow composed an elegy whose ring of
sincerity is rare in the usually artificial literature of the Ferrara
court. “Why may I not go down to the grave with thee?” she asks the
slain poet:</p>
<p>Vorrei col foco mio quel freddo ghiaccio</p>
<p>lntorpidire, e rimpastar col pianto</p>
<p>La polve, e ravivarla a nuove vita!</p>

<p>had sung their lays in Dante’s time, and had left a mood of fanciful,
not onerous, chivalry. Here, and throughout northern Italy, the legends
of Charlemagne, his knights, and his wars with the Moslem infidels had
be- come almost as familiar as in France. The French trouveres had
spread and swelled these legends as chansons de geste; and their
recitals, piling episode upon episode, hero upon heroine, had become a
mass of fiction monumental and confused, crying out for some Homer to
weave the tales into sequence and unity.</p>
<p>As an English knight, Sir Thomas Malory, had recently accomplished
this with the legends of Arthur and the Round Table, so now an Italian
nobleman took up the task for the cycle of Charlemagne. Matteo Maria
Boiardo, Count of Scandjano, was among the most distinguished members of
the Ferrara court. He served the Estensi as ambassador on important
missions, and was entrusted by them with the administration of their
largest dependencies, Modena and Reggio. He governed poorly but sang
well. He addressed passionate verses to Antonia Caprara, soliciting and
publishing her charms, or reproaching her for lack of fidelity in sin.
When he married Taddea Gonzaga he turned his muse to graze in safer
pastures, and began an epic — Orlando innamorato (1486O — recounting the
troubled love of Or- lando (i.e., Roland) for the enchantress Angelica,
and mingling with this romance a hundred scenes of tilt, tournament, and
war. A humorous leg- end tells how Boiardo sought far and wide to find a
properly resounding name for the boastful Saracen in his tale, and how,
when he hit upon the mighty cognomen of Rodomonte, the bells of the
Count’s fief, Scandiano, were set ringing for joy, as if aware that
their lord was unwittingly giving a word to a dozen languages.</p>
<p>It is hard for us, in our own exciting times, agitated even in peace
with the tilts and tournaments of hostile words, to interest ourselves
in the imagi- nary wars and loves of Orlando, Rinaldo, Astolfo,
Ruggiero, Agramante, Marfisa, Fiordelisa, Sacripante, Agricane; and
Angelica, who might have stirred us by her beauty, disconcerts us by the
supernatural enchantments that she practises; we are no longer bewitched
by sorceresses. These are tales that befitted a comely audience in some
palace bower or garden close; and indeed, we are told, the Count read
these cantos at the Ferrara court 9 — doubtless a canto or two at a
sitting; we do Boiardo and Ariosto injustice when we try to take them an
epic at a time. They wrote for a leisurely generation and class, and
Boiardo for one that had not yet seen the invasion of Italy by Charles
VIII. When that disillusioning humiliation came, and Italy saw how
helpless she was, with all her art and poetry, against the ruth-</p>
<p>2J2 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xless powers of the North, Boiardo lost heart, and after writing
60,000 lines he dropped his pen with a stanza of despair:</p>
<p>Mentre che to canto , 0 Dio redentore ,</p>
<p>Vedo V Italia tntto a fiamma e foco ,</p>
<p>Per questi Galli , che con gran valore</p>
<p>Vengon , per disertar non so che loco . . .*</p>
<p>He did well to end, and wisely died (1494) before the invasion had
reached full force. The noble sentiment of chivalry that had found rough
utterance in his poetry evoked only the rarest response in the troubled
generation that ensued. Though he had earned a niche in history by
developing the mod- ern omantic epic, his voice was soon forgotten in
the wars and turmoil of AI &lt; nso’s reign, in the alien rape of Italy,
and in the seduct ive beauty of Ariosto’s gentler verse.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ARIOSTO</li>
</ol>
<p>As we approach the supreme poet of the Italian Renaissance, we must
remind ourselves that poetry is an untranslatable music, and that those
of us to whom the Italian language is not a native boon must not expect
to under- stand why Italy ranks Lodovico Ariosto only next to Dante
among her bards, and reads the Orlando furioso with an affectionate
delight surpassing that which Englishmen take in Shakespeare’s plays. We
shall hear the words but miss the melody.</p>
<p>He was born on September 14, 1474, at Reggio Emilia, where his father
was governor. In 1481 the family moved to Rovigo, but apparently Lo-
dovico received his education in Ferrara. Like Petrarch he was set to
study law, but preferred to write poetry. He was not much disturbed by
the French invasion of 1494; and when Charles VIII prepared a second
descent into Italy (1496), Ariosto composed an ode, in Horatian style,
putting the matter in what seemed to him a proper perspective:</p>
<p>What signifies to me the coming of Charles and his hosts? I shall</p>
<p>rest in the shade, hearkening to the gentle murmur of the waters,</p>
<p>watching the reapers at work; and thou, O my Phyllis, wilt
stretch</p>
<p>thy white hand among the enameled flowers, and weave me garlands to
the music of thy voice. 10</p>
<p>In 1 500 the father died, leaving to his ten children a patrimony

<p>2 73</p>
<p>to support one or two. Lodovico, the oldest, became father of the
family, and began a long struggle with economic insecurity. His
anxieties warped his character into a timidity and angry subservience
unintelligible to those who have never hungered between rhymes. In 1503
he entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito d’Este. Ippolito had little
taste for poetry, and kept Ariosto uncomfortably busy with diplomatic
errands and trivia, for which the poet received 240 lire (000?) a year,
irregularly paid. He sought to improve his position by writing lauds of
the Cardinal’s courage and chastity, and defending the blinding of
Giulio. Ippolito offered to raise his salary if he would take holy
orders and become eligible for certain available bene- fices; but
Ariosto disliked the clergy, and preferred to philander rather than to
burn.</p>
<p>It was during his service with Ippolito that he wrote most of his
plays. He had begun as an actor, and had been one of the company that
Ercole sent to Pavia. When he himself devised dramas they bore the stamp
of Terence or Plautus, and were frankly offered as imitations. 11 His
Cassaria was performed at Ferrara in 1508, his Suppositi at Rome in 1519
before an approving Leo X. He continued to write plays till his last
year, and left the best of them, Scolastica, unfinished at his death.
Nearly all turn on the classic theme of how one or more young men,
usually through the wits of their servants, may possess themselves, by
marriage or seduction, of one or more young women. Ariosto’s plays rank
high in Italian comedy, low in the history of drama.</p>
<p>It was again during his employment with Ippolito that the poet wrote
most of his enormous epic, Orlando furioso; apparently the Cardinal was
no hard taskmaster after all. When Ariosto showed Ippolito the
manuscript the realistic prelate, according to an uncertain tradition —
re non vero , ben trovato — asked him, “Where, Messer Lodovico, have you
found so much no nsense ( tante corbellerie )?” 12 But the laudatory
dedication seemed to make more sense, and the Cardinal paid the cost of
publishing the poem (1515), and secured all rights and profits of its
sale to Ariosto. Italy did not think the poem nonsense, or thought it
delectable nonsense; nine printings were bought up between 1524 and
1527. Soon the choicest passages were being recited or sung throughout
the peninsula. Ariosto himself read much of it to Isabella d’Este in her
illness at Mantua, and rewarde d her patience with a eulogy in later
editions. He spent ten years (1505-15) writing the Furioso, sixteen more
in polishing it; every now and then he added a canto, until the whole
ran to almost 39,000 lines, equivalent to the Iliad and the Odyssey
combined.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XAt first he merely proposed to continue and expand Boiardo’s Orlando
innamorato. He took from his predecessor the chivalric setting and
theme, the loves and battles of Charlemagne’s knights, the central cha
racters, the loose episodic construction, the suspension of one
narrative to pass to an- other, the magic operations that often turn the
tale, even the idea of tracing the pedigree of the Estensi to the
marriage of the mythical Ruggiero and Bradamante. And yet, while
praising a hundred others, he never mentions Boiardo’s name; no man is a
hero to his debtor. Perhaps Ariosto felt that the theme and characters
belonged to the cycle of legends themselves, rather than to Boiardo.</p>
<p>Like the Count, and unlike the legends, he stressed the role of love
above that of war, and so proclaimed in his opening lines:</p>
<p>Le donne, i cavalier , I’anne, gli amori,</p>
<p>Le cortesie, 1’a.udaci imprese io canto —</p>
<p>“Women I sing, and knights, and arms, and loves, and deeds of
chivalry and bold emprise.” The story carries out this program
faithfully: it is a series of combats, some for Christianity against
Islam, most for women. A dozen counts and kings contest Angelica; she
flirts with them all, plays them one against another, and is caught in
an anticlimax when she falls in love with a handsome mediocrity, and
marries him before she has time to make the usual examination of his
income. Orlando, who enters the story after eight cantos have rolled by,
pursues her over three continents, neglecting meanwhile to go to the aid
of his sovereign Charlemagne when the Saracens attack Paris. He goes mad
on learning that he has lost her (canto XXIII), and recovers sanity
sixteen cantos later when his lost wits are found in the moon and
brought back to him by a predecessor of Jules Verne’s lunar navigators.
This central theme is confused and obfuscated by the interpolated adven-
tures of a dozen other knights, who pursue their respective women
through forty-six cantos of seductive verse. The women enjoy the chase,
perhaps excepting Isabella, who persuades Rodomonte to cut off her head
rather than to deflower her, and earns a monument. The old legend of
St. George is included: the beautiful Angelica is chained to the rocks
beside the sea as a propitiatory offering to a dragon who hungers for a
virgin annually; and before Ruggiero can arrive to rescue her the poet
contemplates her with Correggian appreciation:</p>

<p>Ariosto does not take all this too seriously; he is writing to amuse;
he deliberately charms us, by the incantation of his verse, into an
unreal world, and mystifies his tale with fairies, magic weapons and
enchantments, winged horses touring the clouds, men turned into trees,
fortresses melting at an imperious word. Orlando spits six Dutchmen on
one spear; Astolfo creates a fleet by throwing leaves into the air, and
catches the wind in a bladder. Ariosto laughs with us at all this, and
smiles tolerantly, not sarcastically, at the tilts and shams of
chivalry. He has an excellent sense of humor, salted</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xwith gentle irony; so he includes, in the waste deposited by the
earth upon the moon, the prayers of hypocrites, the flatteries of poets
( peccavit ), the services of courtiers, the Donation of Constantine
(XXXIV). Only now and then, in a few moral exordiums, does Ariosto
pretend to philosophy. He was so completely the poet that he lost and
consumed himself in forging and polishing a beautiful form for his
verse; he had no energy left to pour into it an ennobling purpose or a
philosophy of life. 13 *</p>
<p>Italians love the Furioso because it is a treasury of exciting
stories — with never a pretty woman too far away — told in melodious and
yet unaffected language, and in racy stanzas that lure us swiftly on
from scene to scene. They forgive the long detours and descriptions, the
innumerable and some- times labored similes, for these too are dressed
in sparkling verse. They are rewarded, and s ilently shout “Bravo!” when
the poet hammers out a strik - ing line, as when he says of Zerbino,</p>
<p>Natura il fece, e pot roppe la stampa, — 1 *</p>
<p>“Nature made him, and then broke the mold.” They are not long
disturbed by Ariosto’s expectant flattery of t he Estensi, his paeans to
Ippolito, his praise of Lucrezia’s chastity. These obeisances were in
the manner of the times; Machiavelli would stoop as low to conquer a
subsidy; and a poet must live.</p>
<p>But this became difficult when the Cardinal decided to campaign in
Hun- gary, and desired Ariosto to accompany him. Ariosto demurred, and
Ip- polito freed him from further service and recompense (1517). Alfonso
saved the poet from penury by giving him an annual stipend of
eighty-four crowns (050?), plus three servants and two horses, and
requiring almost nothing in return. After forty-seven years of obstinate
but hardly celibate bachelordom, Ariosto now married Alessandra Benucci,
whom he had loved when she was still the wife of Tito Vespasiano
Strozzi. By her he had no children, but two natural sons had rewarded
his premarital efforts.</p>
<p>For three years (1522-5) he served unhappily as governor of the Gar-
fagnana, a mountainous region racked with brigandage. But he was unfit
for action or command, and gladly retired to spend the remaining eight
years of his life in Ferrara. In 1528 he bought a plot of land on the
out- skirts of the city, and built a pretty house, still shown in the
Via Ariosto, and maintained by the state. Across the front he inscribed
Horatian lines of proud simplicity: Parva sed apta mihi, sed nulli
obnoxia, sed non sordida , parta meo sed tamen aere domus — “Small but
suitable for me, hurtful to no one, not mean, yet acquired by my own
funds: home.” There he lived FERRARA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>2 77</p>
<p>quietly, working occasionally in his garden, and revising or
expanding the Furioso every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, further emulating Horace, he had written to various
friends seven poetical epistles that have come down to us under the name
of satires. They are not as sharp and compact as those of his model, nor
as bitter and lethal as Juvenal’s; they were the product of a mind
loving and never quite finding peace, bearing fretfully the whips and
scorns of time, the proud man’s contumely. They describe the faults of
the clergy, the simony ramp- ant in Rome, the nepotism of worldly popes
(Satire i). They excoriate Ippolito for paying his menials better than
his poet (ii). They expound a cynical conception of women as rarely
faithful or honest, and offer the advice of a tardy expert on choosing
and taming a wife (iii) . They lament the indignities of a courtier’s
life, and wryly recount an unsuccessful visit to Leo X (iv) :</p>
<p>I kissed his foot, he bent down from the holy seat, took my hand,</p>
<p>and saluted me on both cheeks. Besides, he made me free of half the
stamp dues I was bound to pay. Then, breast full of hope but body</p>
<p>soaked with rain and smirched with mud, I went and had my supper at
the Ram.</p>
<p>Two satires mourn his narrow life at Garfagnana, his days “spent in
threat - ening, punishing, persuading, or acquitting,” his muse
frightened and para - lyzed into silence by crimes, lawsuits, and
brawls; and his mistress so many miles away! (v-vi) The last epistle
asks Bembo to recommend a Greek tutor for Ariosto’s son Virginio:</p>
<p>The Greek must be learned but also of sound principles, for
erudi-</p>
<p>tion without morality is worse than worthless. Unhappily, in
these</p>
<p>days, it is difficult to find a teacher of this sort. Few humanists
are</p>
<p>free from the most infamous of vices, and intellectual vanity
makes</p>
<p>most of them skeptics also. Why is it that learning and infidelity
go</p>
<p>hand in hand ? 15</p>
<p>Ariosto himself had through most of his life taken religion lightly;
but, like nearly all the intellects of the Renaissance, he made his
peace with it in the end. Even from youth he had suffered from a
bronchial catarrh, which was probably aggravated by his travels as
courier for the Cardinal. In 1532 the trouble sank deeper, and became
tuberculosis. He struggled against it as if not satisfied with a mere
immortality of fame. He was only fifty-eight when he died (1533).</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XHe had become a classic long before his death. Twenty-three years
ear- lier Raphael had painted him, in the Parnassus fresco of the
Vatican, with Homer and Virgil, Horace and Ovid, Dante and Petrarch,
among the un- forgettable voices of mankind. Italy calls him her Homer,
and the Furioso her Iliad; but even to an idolater of Italy this appears
more generous than just. The world of Ariosto seems light and fantastic
beside the ruthless siege of Troy; his knights — some as
indistinguishable in their character as in their armor — hardly rise to
the majesty of Agamemnon, the passion of Achilles, the wisdom of Nestor,
the nobility of Hector, the tragedy of Priam; and who will equate the
fair and flighty Angelica with the dia gynaikon, the goddess among
women, Helen conqueror in defeat? And yet the last word must be as the
first: only those can judge Ariosto who know his language thoroughly,
who can catch the nuances of his gaiety and his sentiment, and can
respond to all the music of his melodious dream.</p>
<p>V. AFTERMATH</p>
<p>It was the Italians themselves, with their lusty sense of humor, who
pro- vided an antidote to the romanticism of the two Orlandos. Six years
before Ariosto’s death Girolamo Folengo published an Orlandino in which
the absurdities of the epics were caricatured with hilarious
exaggerations. Gi- rolamo heard the skeptical lectures of Pomponazzi at
Bologna, adopted a curriculum of amours, intrigues, fisticuffs, and
duels, and was expelled from the University. His father disowned him,
and he became a Benedictine monk (1507), perhaps as a means of
subsistence. Six years later he fell in love with Girolama Dieda, and
eloped with her. In 1519 he published a volume of burlesques under the
title of Maccaronea, which thenceforth gave its name to a swelling
literature of rough and ribald satire in mingled Latin and Italian
verse. The Orlandino was a riotous mock epic, in coarse and popular
vernacular, pursuing a serious vein for a stanza or two, then startling
the reader with a thought and phrase worthy of the most sca- tophilic
privy councilor. The knights, armed with kitchen utensils, rush into the
lists on limping mules. The leading churchman of the tale is the monk
Griffarosto — Abbot Grab-the-Roast — whose library consists of cook
books interspersed with victuals and wine, and “all the tongues he knew
were those o f oxen and swine”; 16 through him Folengo satirizes the
clergy of Italy to any Lutheran’s content. The work was received with
guffaws of applause, but the author continued to starve. Finally he
retired again to a monastery, wrote pious poetry, and died in the odor
of sanctity at fifty-</p>

<p>three (1544). Rabelais relished him, 17 and perhaps Ariosto, in his
final years, joined in the merriment.</p>
<p>Alfonso I kept his little state secure against all the assaults of
the papacy, and at last took a reckless revenge by encouraging and
abetting the Ger- man-Spanish army that besieged, captured, and
plundered Rome (1527). 18 Charles V expressed appreciation by restoring
to him Ferrara’s ancient fiefs, Modena and Reggio, so that Alfonso
transmitted his duchy undiminished to his heirs. In 1 528 he sent his
son Ercole to France to bring home a diplo- matic bride from the royal
family — Renee or Renata — tiny, somber, de- formed, and secretly won by
the heresy of Calvin. Alfonso, after Lu-</p>
<p>crezia’s passing, consoled himself with a mistress, Laura Dianti, and
perhaps married her before his death (1534). He had outwitted every
enemy but time.</p>
