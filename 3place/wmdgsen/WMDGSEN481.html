<p>The Growth of Knowledge</p>
<p>1300-1517</p>
<p>I. THE MAGICIANS</p>
<p>T HE two centuries whose European history has been so hastily
sketched in the preceding chapters were still part of what tradition
calls the</p>
<p>Middle Ages — which we may loosely define as the life of Europe
between</p>
<p>The stars were studied not only to guide navigation and date
religious festivals, but also to forecast terrestrial occurrences and
personal destinies. The pervasive influences of climate and season, the
relation of tides to the moon, the lunar periodicity of women, and the
dependence of agriculture upon the modes and moods of the sky, seemed to
justify the claims of astrol- ogy that the heavens of today forecast the
events of tomorrow. Such pre- dictions were regularly published (as
now), and reached a wide and avid audience. Princes dared not begin a
campaign, a battle, a journey, or a build- ing without assurance from
the astrologers that the stars were in a propitious configuration. Henry
V of England kept his own astrolabe to chart the sky, and when his queen
was lying-in he cast his own horoscope of the child . 1 Astrologers were
as welcome as humanists at Matthias Corvinus’s enlight - ened court.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 2 3 1</p>
<p>The stars, men believed, were guided by angels, and the air was
congested with invisible spirits, some from heaven, some from hell.
Demons lurked everywhere, especially in one’s bed; to them some men
ascribed their nig ht losses, some women their untimely pregnancies; and
theologians agreed that such infernal concubines were real. 2 At every
turn, at any moment, the credulous individual could step out of the
sense world into a realm of magic beings and powers. Every natural
object had supernatural qualities. Kooks of magic were among the “best
sellers” of the day. The bishop of Cahors was tortured, scourged, and
burned at the stake (1317) after confessing that he had burned a wax
image of Pope John XXII in the hope that the original, as the magic art
promised, would suffer like the effigy. 8 People believed that a wafer
consecrated by a priest would, if pricked, bleed with the blood of
Christ.</p>
<p>The repute of the alchemists had declined, but their honest research
and glittering chicanery went on. While royal and papal edicts denounced
them, they persuaded some kings that alchemy might replenish exhausted
treas- uries, and simple people swallowed “potable gold” 4 guaranteed to
cure any - thing but gullibility. (Gold is still taken by patients and
physicians in treating arthritis.)</p>
<p>The science of medicine contended at every step with astrology,
theol- ogy, and quackery. Nearly all physicians related the prognosis of
a disease to the constellation under which the sufferer had been born or
taken ill; so the great surgeon Guy de Chauliac could write (1363), “If
anyone is wounded in the neck while the moon is in Taurus, the
affliction will be dan- gerous.” 5 One of the earliest printed d
ocuments was a calendar published at Mainz (1462) indicating the
astrologically best times for bloodletting. Epidemics were widely
ascribed to unlucky associations of the stars. Prob- ably through
disillusionment with medicine, millions of Christians turned to faith
healing. Thousands came to the kings of France or England to be cured of
scrofula by a touch of the royal hand. Apparently the custom had begun
with Louis IX, whose saintliness led to the belief that he could work
mira- cles. His power was supposed to have gone down to his successors,
and, through Isabella of Valois, mother of Edward III, to the rulers of
England. More thousands made pilgrimages to curative shrines, and turned
some saints into medical specialists; so a chapel of St. Vitus was
frequented by sufferers from chorea, since that saint was believed to be
a specific for this disease. The tomb of Pierre de Luxembourg, a
cardinal who at eighteen died of ascetic austerities, became a favorite
goal, where, within fifteen months after his death, 1 ,964 cures were
ascribed to the magic efficacy of his bones.® Quacks flourished, but the
law began to hamper them. In 1382 Roger Clerk, who had pretended to cure
disease by applying charms, was condemned to ride through London with
urinals hanging from his neck. 7</p>
<p>232 the reformation (chap. xn</p>
<p>Most Europeans believed in sorcery — i.e., the power of persons to
control evil spirits and secure their help. The Dark Ages had been
comparatively enlightened in this respect: Saints Boniface and Agobard
denounced the belief in sorcery as sinful and ridiculous; Charlemagne
made it a capital crime to execute anyone on a charge of witchcraft; and
Pope Gregory VII Hilde- brand forbade inquisition to be made for
sorcerers as the cause of storms or plagues. 8 But the emphasis laid by
preachers upon the reality of hell and the wiles of Satan strengthened
popular belief in the ubiquitous and iniquitous presence of himself or
one of his company; and many a diseased mind or desperate soul harbored
the idea of summoning such devils to its aid. Accu- sations of sorcery
were made against a great variety of people, including Pope Boniface
VIII. In 1315 the aristocrat Enguerrand de Marigny was hanged for
sorcery, and in 1317 Pope John XXII ordered the execution of various
obscure persons for plotting to kill him by invoking the assistance of
demons. John repeatedly denounced the appeal to demons, ordered pros-
ecutions for it, and prescribed penalties; but his edicts were
interpreted by the people as confirming their belief in the existence
and availability of demonic powers. After 1320 the indictments for
sorcery multiplied, and many of the accused were hanged or burned at the
stake. It was a common opinion in France that Charles VI had been made
insane by magic means; two sorcerers were engaged who promised to
restore his wits; when they failed they were beheaded (1397). In 1398
the theological faculty of the University of Paris issued twenty-eight
articles condemning sorcery, but assuming its occasional efficacy.
Chancellor Gerson pronounced it a heresy to question the existence or
activity of demons.®</p>
<p>Witchcraft was the practice of sorcery by persons who were alleged to
worship Satan, in nocturnal assemblies or “Sabbaths,” as the master of
the demons whom they affected to employ. According to popular belief the
witches, usually women, secured supernatural powers at the price of this
devil-worship. So commissioned, they were supposed to override natural
laws, and to bring misfortune or death to whom they wished. Scholars
like Erasmus and Thomas More accepted the reality of witchcraft; some
priests in Cologne doubted it; the University of Cologne affirmed it. 10
Most church- men claimed — and lay historians in some measure agree —
that the secret gatherings by night were excuses for promiscuous sexual
relations, and for initiating young people into the arts of debauchery.
11 Whether through in- sane delusion, or to secure release from torture,
many witches allegedly con- fessed to one or another of the evil
practices charged to them. It may be that these “witches’ Sabbaths”
served as a moratorium on a burdensome Chris - tianity, and as a partly
playful, partly rebellious worship of Satan as the powerful enemy of a
God who condemned so many pleasures to repression and so many souls to
hell; or these clandestine rites may have recalled and</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 233</p>
<p>reaffirmed pagan cults and feasts of the deities of earth and field
and forest, of procreation and fertility, of Bacchus, Priapus, Ceres,
and Flora.</p>
<p>Secular and episcopal courts joined in efforts to suppress what
seemed to them the most blasphemous depravity. Several popes — in 1374,
1409, 1437, 1451, and especially Innocent VIII in 1484 — commissioned
agents of the Inquisition to deal with witches as abandoned heretics,
whose sins and machi- nations blighted the fruit of fields and wombs,
and whose pretensions might seduce whole communities into demonolatry.
The popes took literally a passage in Exodus (22:18): “Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.” Never - theless the ecclesiastical courts,
before 1446, contented themselves with mild penalties, unless a pardoned
offender relapsed. In 1446 the Inquisition burned several witches at
Heidelberg; in 1460 it burned twelve men and women at Arras; and the
name Vaudois given them, as generally to heretics (Walden- ses) and
witches in France, survived an Atlantic voyage to generate the word
Voodooism for Negro sorcery in the French colonies of America. 12 In
1487 the Dominican inquisitor Jacob Sprenger, honestly frightened by the
ap- parent spread of sorcery, published an official guide for the
detection of witches, Malleus maleficarum ( Hammer of Witches).
Maximilian I, then King of the Romans, prefaced with a letter of warm
recommendation this “most portentous monument of superstition which the
world has pro - duced.” 1 8 These maleficent women, said Sprenger, by
stirring up some devil- ish brew in a caldron, or by other means, can
summon swarms of locusts and caterpillars to devour a harvest; they can
make men impotent and women barren; they can dry up a woman’s milk, or
bring abortion; by a look alone they can cause love or hatred, sickness
or death. Some of them kidnap chil- dren, roast them, and eat them. They
can see things at a distance, and fore- see the weather; they can
transform themselves, and others, into beasts. 14 Sprenger wondered why
there were more female than male witches, and concluded that it was
because women were more lightheaded and sensual than men; besides, he
added, they had always been favorite instruments of Satan. 16 He burned
forty-eight of them in five years. From his time onward the
ecclesiastical attack upon witchcraft was intensified until it reached
its full fury in the sixteenth century, under Catholic and Protestant
auspices alike; in this type of fearful ferocity the Middle Ages were
outdone by modern times. In 1554 an officer of the Inquisition boasted
that in the pre- ceding 150 years the Holy Office had burned at least
30,000 witches, who, if they had been left unpunished, would have
brought the whole world to destruction. 16</p>
<p>Many books were written in this age against superstition, and all
contained superstitions. 17 Agostino Trionfo addressed to Pope Clement V
a treatise ad- vising him to outlaw occult practices, but Trionfo held
it unpardonable in</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>*34</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>a physician to perform a phlebotomy during certain phases of the
moon. 18 Pope John XXII issued powerful blasts against alchemy (1317)
and magic ( 1 327) ; he mourned what he thought was the increasing
prevalence of sacri- fices to demons, pacts with the Devil, and the
making of images, rings, and potions for magical purposes; he pronounced
ipso facto excommunication upon all practitioners of such arts; but even
he implied a belief in their pos - sible efficacy. 19</p>
<p>The great antagonist of astrology in this age was Nicole Oresme, who
died as bishop of Lisieux in 1 3 82 . He laughed at astrologers who
could not predict the sex of an unborn child but, after its birth,
professed to foretell its earthly fate; such horoscopes, said Oresme,
are old wives’ tales. Repeating the title and effort of Cicero fourteen
centuries back, he wrote De divinatione against the claims of
soothsayers, dream interpreters, and the like. Amid his general
skepticism of the occult he admitted that some events could be explained
as the work of demons or angels. He accepted the notion of the “evil
eye”; he thought that a criminal would darken a mirror by looking into
it, and that the glance of a lynx could penetrate a wall. He
acknowledged the miracles of the Bible, but he repudiated supernatural
explanations where natural causes sufficed. Many people, said Nicole,
are credulous of magic because they lack acquaintance with natural
causes and processes. They accept on hearsay what they have not seen,
and so legend — as of a magician climbing a rope thrown into the air —
may become a popular belief. 20 (This is the oldest- known mention of
the rope-climbing myth.) Consequently, Oresme argued, the wide
prevalence of a belief is no proof of its truth. Even if many persons
claim to have witnessed an event contrary to our ordinary experience of
nature, we should hesitate to believe them. Moreover, the senses are so
easily deceived! The color, shape, and sound of objects vary with
distance, light, and the condition of the sensory organs; an object at
rest may seem to be moving, and one in motion may seem at rest; a coin
at the bottom of a vase filled with water appears more remote than one
so placed in an empty vase. Sensations must be interpreted by judgment,
and this too may err. These de- ceptions of senses and judgment, says
Oresme, explain many of the marvels ascribed to supernatural or magical
powers. 21</p>
<p>Despite such brave advances toward a scientific spirit, the old
supersti- tions survived, or merely changed their form. Nor were they
confined to the populace. Edward III of England paid a great sum for a
phial which, he was assured, had belonged to St. Peter. Charles V of
France was shown, in Sainte Chape lle, a phial allegedly containing some
of Christ’s blood; he asked his savants and theologians whether this
could be true; they answered cautiously in the affirmative. 22 It was in
this atmosphere that education, science, medi- cine, and philosophy
struggled to grow.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>235</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE TEACHERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The rise of commerce and industry put a new premium on education.
Literacy had been a costly luxury in an agricultural regime; it was a
necessity in an urban commercial world. Law tardily recognized the
change. In Eng- land (1391) the feudal landowners petitioned Richard II
to enforce the old rule that forbade a serf to send his son to school
without his lord’s consent and reimbursement for the loss of a farm
hand. Richard refused, and in the next reign a statute decreed that any
parent might send any of his children to school. 28</p>
<p>Under this education-emancipation act elementary schools multiplied.
In the countryside monastic schools survived; in the cities grade
schools were provided by churches, hospitals, chantries, and guilds.
Attendance was volun- tary but general, even in villages. Usually the
teachers were priests, but the proportion of lay instructors rose in the
fourteenth century. The curriculum stressed the catechism, the Creed,
the basic prayers, reading, writing, arith- metic, singing, and
flogging. Even in secondary schools flogging was the staff of
instruction. A divine explained that “the boys’ spirits must be sub -
dued”; 24 the parents agreed with him; and perhaps ’tis so. Agnes Paston
urged the tutor of her unstudious son to “belash him” if he did not
amend, “for I had lever he were fairly buried than lost by default.”
26</p>
<p>Secondary schools continued the religious training, and added
grammatica, which included not merely grammar and composition, but the
language and expurgated literature of classic Rome; the students — boys
of the middle class — learned to read and write Latin, however
indifferently, as a necessity in foreign trade as well as in a church
career. The best secondary schools of the time were those established in
the Lowlands and Germany by the Breth- ren of the Common Life; the one
at Deventer drew 2,000 pupils. The wealthy and energetic Bishop of
Winchester, William of Wykeham, set a precedent by founding there (1372)
the first of England’s “public” schools— institutions endowed, by
private or public philanthropy, to provide college preparatory training
for a limited selection of boys. The example was fol- lowed by Henry VI,
who established (1440) and richly endowed Eton School to prepare
students for King’s College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Above the elementary level the education of women, with some highborn
exceptions, was confined to the home. Many women of the middle class,
like Margaret Paston, learned to write fair English, and a sprinkling of
women acquired some acquaintance with literature and philosophy. The
sons of the aristocracy received an education quite different from that
of the schools. Till the age of seven they were taught by the women of
the house; then they were sent to serve, as pages, a related or
neighboring noble. Safe there from</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>the excesses of affection, they learned reading, writing, religion,
and man- ners from the ladies and the local priest. At fourteen they
became squires — i.e., adult servitors of their lord. Now they learned
to ride, shoot, hunt, joust, and wage war. Book learning they left to
their inferiors.</p>
<p>These were meanwhile developing one of the noblest legacies of the
Middle Ages — the universities. While the ecstasy of ecclesiastical
architecture</p>
<p>In Oxford no love was wasted between town and gown — citizens and
scholars. In 1 3 5 5 the hostile camps rushed into open war, and so many
heroes were killed that the year was known as that of the Great
Slaughter. Despite the introduction of flogging into the universities of
England (c. 1 350), the students were a troublesome lot. Forbidden to
engage in intramural athletics, they spent their energy in profanity,
tippling, and venery; taverns and brothels throve on their patronage.
Attendance at Oxford fell from its thir- teenth-century peak to as low
as a thousand; and after the expulsion of Wy- clif academic freedom was
rigorously curtailed by episcopal control.</p>
<p>Cambridge profited from the Wyclif controversy and the Lollard scare;
cautious conservatives kept their sons from Oxford and sent them to the
younger university, so that by the end of the fifteenth century the
rival in- stitutions had a fairly equal registration. New “halls” were
founded along the Cam: Michaelhouse, University or Clare, Pembroke,
Gonville and Caius, Trinity, Corpus Christi, King’s, Queen’s,
St. Catherine’s, Jesus’, Christ’s, and St. John’s. Like the re sidence
halls at Oxford, these became colleges in our sense during the fifteenth
century as more and more teachers chose them as the places where their
lectures would draw the largest attendance. Classes began at six in the
morning, and continued till five in the afternoon. Mean- while Scotland
and Ireland, out of their poverty, founded the universities of
St. Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and Trinity College, Dublin — four
institutions destined to pour genius, generation after generation, into
the intellectual life of the British Isles.</p>
<p>In France, education, like almost everything else, suffered from the

<p>dred Years’ War. Nevertheless the rising demand for lawyers and
physicians, added to the traditional attractions of an ecclesiastical
career, encouraged the establishment of new universities at Avignon,
Orleans, Cahors, Grenoble, Orange, Aix-en-Provence, Poitiers, Caen,
Bordeaux, Valence, Nantes, and Bourges. The U niversity of Paris,
perhaps because the monarchy was near collapse, became in the fourteenth
century a national power, challenging the Parlement, advising the king,
serving as a court of appeals in French theol- ogy, and recognized by
most continental educators as universitas univer- sitatum. The rise of
provincial and foreign universities reduced registration at Paris; even
so the faculty of arts alone was reputed to have a thousand teachers and
ten thousand pupils in 1406; 26 and in 1490 the entire university had
nearly twenty thousand. 27 Some fifty “colleges” helped to house them.
Discipline was laxer than at Oxford, and the morals of the students com-
plimented their virility rather than their religion. Courses in Greek,
Arabic, Chaldaic, and Hebrew were added to the curriculum.</p>
<p>Spain had founded its leading universities in the thirteenth century
— at Palencia, Salamanca, and Lerida; others now rose at Perpignan,
Huesca, Valladolid, Barcelona, Saragossa, Palma, Sigiienza, Valencia,
Alcala, and Seville. In these institutions ecclesiastical control was
complete, and theology predominated; however, at Alcala, fourteen chairs
were given to grammar, literature, and rhetoric, twelve to divinity and
canon law. Alcala became for a time the greatest educational center in
Spain; in 1525 it had an enrollment of seven thousand. Scholarships were
provided for needy students. The salary of a professor was regulated by
the number of his pupils; and every professor was required to resign
quadrennially, being eligible for reappoint- ment if he had proved
satisfactory. At Lisbon King Diniz had founded a uni- versity in 1 300,
but the turbulence of the students led him to remove it to Coimbra,
whose pride it is today.</p>
<p>Mental activity was in this period more vigorous in Central Europe
than in France or Spain. In 1347 Charles IV founded the University of
Prague, which soon became the intellectual head and voice of the
Bohemian people. Other universities appeared at Cracow, Vienna, Pecs,
Geneva, Erfurt, Heidelberg, Cologne, Buda, Wurzburg, Leipzig, Rostock,
Louvain, Trier, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Greifswald, Basel, Ingolstadt,
Pressburg, Mainz, Tubingen, Copenhagen, Uppsala, Frankfurt-an-Oder, and
Wittenberg. In the second half of the fifteenth century these
institutions seethed with stu- dents and debates. Cracow alone had 1 8,3
38 pupils at one time. 28 The Church provided most of the funds, and
naturally called the tune of thought; but princes, nobles, cities, and
businessmen shared in endowing colleges and scholarships. The Elector
Frederick of Saxony financed the University of Wittenberg partly from
money that came from the sale of indulgences, but which he refused to
remit to Rome. 28 Scholasticism sat in the chairs of phil-</p>

<p>osophy, while humanism grew outside the university walls. Hence most
of the universities of Germany adhered to the Church during the
Reformation, with two significant exceptions: Erfurt, where Luther
studied, and Witten- berg, where he taught.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SCIENTISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The scientific mood was hardly more popular with the pundits than
with the people. The spirit of the age inclined to the “humanities”;
even the re - vival of Greek studies ignored Greek science. In
mathematics the Roman numerals obstructed progress; they seemed
inseparable from Latin culture; the Hindu-Arabic numerals seemed
heretically Mohammedan, and were coldly received, especially north of

<p>Nicole Oresme led an active ecclesiastical career, and yet invaded a
dozen sciences successfully. He paved the way for analytical geometry by
develop- ing the systematic use of co-ordinates, and by employing graphs
to show the growth of a function. He played with the idea of a fourth
dimension, but re- jected it. Like several of his contemporaries he
adumbrated Galileo’s law that the speed of a falling body increases
regularly with the duration of its fall. 30 In a commentary on
Aristotle’s De caelo et mundo he wrote: “We cannot prove by any
experiment that the heavens undergo a daily movement and the earth does
not”; there are “good reasons in dicating that the earth, and not the
sky, undergoes a daily motion.” 31 Oresme fell back upon the Ptolemaic
system, but he had helped to prepare for Copernicus.</p>
<p>When we consider that no telescope or camera existed as yet to watch
or record the sky, it is encouraging to note the energy and intelligence
of medieval astronomers, Moslem, Jewish, and Christian. Jean de Liniers,
after years of personal observations, described the positions of
forty-eight stars with an accuracy then rivaled only by Moslems; and he
calculated the obliquity of the ecliptic to within seven seconds of the
most modern estimate. Jean de Meurs and Firmin de Beauval (1344)
proposed to reform the Julian calendar — which was outstripping the sun
— by omitting the quadrennial February 29 for the next forty years
(which would have erred by excess); the reform had to wait till 1582,
and still awaits international and interfaith</p>

<p>understandings. William Merle of Oxford rescued meteorology from as-
trology by keeping record of the weather through 2,556 days. Unknown ob-
servers or navigators discovered in the fifteenth century the
declination of the magnetic needle: the needle does not point due north,
but inclines toward the astronomic meridian at a small but important
angle, which, as Columbus noted, varies from place to place.</p>
<p>The peak figure in the mathematics and astronomy of this epoch was
Johann Muller, known to history as Regiomontanus from his birth (1436)
near Konigsberg in Lower Franconia. At fourteen he entered the
University of Vienna, where Georg von Purbach was introducing humanism
and the latest Italian advances in mathematics and astronomy. Both men
matured early and died soon: Purbach at thirty-eight, Muller at forty.
Resolved to learn Greek in order to read Ptolemy’s Almagest in the
original, Muller went to Italy, studied Greek with Guarino da Verona,
and devoured all available texts, Greek or Latin, on astronomy and
mathematics. Returning to Vienna, he taught these sciences there, and
with such success that he was called to Buda by Matthias Corvinus, and
then to Nuremberg, where a rich burgher built for him the first European
observatory. Muller equipped it with instruments built or improved by
himself. We feel the pure breeze of science in a letter that he wrote to
a fellow mathematician in 1464: “I do not know whither my pen will run;
it will use up all my paper if I don’t stop it. One problem after
another occurs to me, and there are so many beautiful ones that I
hesitate as to which I should submit to you.” 82 In 1475 Sixtus IV
summoned him to Rome to reform the calendar. There, a year later, Regio-
montanus died.</p>
<p>The short span of his life limited his achievement. He had planned
treatises on mathematics, physies, astrology, and astronomy, and had
hoped to edit the classics in those sciences; only fragments of these
works found form and survival. He com pleted Purbach’s Epitome of the
Almagest. He composed an essay De triangulis — the first book devoted
solely to trigonometry. He was apparently the first to suggest the use
of tangents in astronomic calculations, and his tables of sines and
tangents facilitated the calculations of Copernicus. He formulated
astronomical tables more accurate than any drawn up before. His method
of calculating latitude and longitude proved a boon to mariners. Under
the title of Ephemerides he issued (1474) an almanac showing the daily
position of the planets for the next thirty-two years; from this book
Columbus would predict the lunar eclipse that would fill the stomachs of
his starving men on February 29, 1504. The observations made of Halley’s
comet by Regiomontanus laid the bases of modem cometary astronomy. But
his personal and living influence was greater than that of his books.
His popular lectures in science helped to raise an intellectual
exhilaration in Nuremberg in Diirer’s youth; and he made the city famous
for its nautical</p>

<p>instruments and maps. One of his pupils, Martin Behaim, drew in color
on vellum the oldest known terrestrial globe (1492), still preserved in
the Ger- manisches Museum in Nuremberg.</p>
<p>Modern geography was created not by geographers but by sailors, mer-
chants, missionaries, envoys, soldiers, and pilgrims. Catalonian
skippers made or used excellent maps; their portolani — pilot guides to
Mediterranean ports — were in the fourteenth century almost as accurate
as the navigation charts of our time. 33 Old trade routes to the East
having fallen into Turkish hands, European importers developed new
overland routes through Mongol terri- tory. The Franciscan friar Oderic
of Pordenone, after spending three years in Peking ( c . 1323-26), wrote
an illuminating record of his trip to China via India and Sumatra, and
of his return via Tibet and Persia. Clavijo, as we shall see, gave a
fascinating account of his embassy to Timur. Johann Schnitt- berger of
Bavaria, captured by the Turks at Nicopolis (1396), wandered for thirty
years in Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Russia, and Siberia, and wrote in his
Reisebuch the first West-European description of Siberia. In 1500 Juan
de la Cosa, one of Columbus’ pilots, issued an extensive map of the
world, showing for the first time in cartography the explorations of his
master, of Vasco da Gama, and others. Geography was a moving drama in
the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>In one particular the most influential medieval treatise on geography
was the Imago mundi (1410) of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly, which encouraged
Columbus by describing the Atlantic as traversable “in a very few days
if the wind be fair.” 34 It was but one of half a dozen works that this
alert ec- clesiastic wrote on astronomy, geography, meteorology,
mathematics, logic, metaphysics, psychology, and the reform of the
calendar and the Church. Reproached for giving so much time to secular
studies, he replied that a theologian should keep abreast of science. 35
He saw some science even in astrology; and on astrological grounds he
predicted a great change in Chris- tianity within a hundred years, and
world-shaking events in 1789. 36</p>
<p>The best scientific thought of the fourteenth century was in physics.
Dietrich of Freiburg (d. 13 1 1 ) gave essentially our modern
explanation of the rainbow as due to two refractions, and one
reflection, of the sun’s rays in drops of water. Jean Buridan did
excellent work in theoretical physics; it is a pity that he is famous
only for his ass, which may not have been his.* Born near Arras before 1
300, Buridan studied and taught at the University of Paris. He not only
argued for the daily rotation of the earth, but he</p>
<p>• The tale of “Buridan’s ass” is not found in his extant works, but
is a tradition of respectable</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 241</p>
<p>eliminated from astronomy the angelic intelligences to which
Aristotle and Aquinas had ascribed the guidance and motion of the
heavenly bodies. Noth- ing more is needed to explain their movements,
said Buridan, than a start originally given them by God, and the law of
impetus — that a body in motion continues its motion except as hindered
by some existing force; here Buridan anticipated Galileo, Descartes, and
Newton. The motions of planets and stars, he added, are governed by the
same mechanical laws that operate on earth. 37 These propositions, now
so trite, were deeply damaging to the medieval world view. They almost
date the beginning of astronomical physics.</p>
<p>Buridan’s ideas were taken to Germany and It aly by his pupils, and
in- fluenced Leonardo, Copernicus, Bruno, and Galileo. 38 Albert of
Saxony carried them to the university that he founded at Vienna (1364),
Marsilius von Inghen to the university that he founded at Heidelberg
(1386). Albert was one of the first to reject the Aristotelian notion
that a vacuum is im- possible; he developed the idea of a center of
gravity in every body; he antic- ipated Galileo’s principles of static
equilibrium and the uniform acceleration</p>
<p>Practical mechanics made some modest advances. Complicated windmills
were used to pump water, drain soil, grind grain, and do other chores.
Water power was employed in smelting and sawing, in driving furnace
bellows, tilt hammers, silk-spinning machines. Cannon were cast and
bored. Steel was made in sizable quantities; large blast furnaces were
set up in northern Eu- rope in the fourteenth century. Well boring is
mentioned in 1 373; wiredraw- ing was practiced at Nuremberg in the
fifteenth century; a pump composed of buckets on an endless chain is
pictured in a manuscript of 143 8. 40 In a drawing by the Hussite
engineer Conrad Keyser (c. 1405) occurs the earliest known
representation of reciprocating motion converted into rotary motion: two
arms, moving in alternation, revolve a shaft precisely as the pistons
turn the crankshaft of an automobile. 41</p>
<p>Better mechanisms for measuring time were demanded as commerce and
industry grew. Monks and farmers had divided the daylight into the same
number of periods in all seasons, making the periods longer in summer
than in winter. City life required more uniform divisions of time, and
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries clocks and watches were made
that divided the day into equal parts throughout the year. In some
places the hours were numbered from one to twenty-four, as in the
military chro- nometry of our time; and as late as 1 370 some clocks,
like that of San Gotardo in Milan, struck the full number. This proved
to be a noisy extravagance. By 1 375 the day was regularly divided into
two halves of twelve hours each.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>2 4 2</p>
<p>(chap, xh</p>
<p>The essential principle of the mechanical clock was a weight slowly
turn- ing a wheel, whose revolution was checked by an escapement tooth
suffi- ciently resistant to allow the wheel to turn by only one cog in a
given interval of time. Such a timepiece had been described about 1271.
The first mechan- ical clocks were set up in church towers or belfries
visible through large areas of a town. One of the earliest was installed
(1326-35) in the abbey of St. Albans by Richard Wallingford; it showed
not only the hours and min- utes of the day but the ebb and flow of the
tide, and the motions of the sun and moon. Later clocks added a medley
of gadgets. The clock (1352) in Strasbourg Cathedral showed a crowing
cock, the three Magi, and a human figure on which were indicated, for
each part of the body, the proper time for bloodletting. The cathedral
clock at Wells used a moving image of the sun to point the hour, and a
small star, moving on an inner circle, to indicate the minute; a third
circle gave the day of the month; and on a platform above the dial four
horsemen emerged and charged as each hour struck. On a fifteenth-century
clock at Jena a b uffoon’s head opened its monstrous mouth to receive a
golden apple from a pilgrim, only to have the apple snatched away as his
mouth began to close upon it; this comedy was performed every hour of
every day for hundreds of years; and the clock still exists. A similar
clock at Nuremberg, set up in 1 506 and rudely interrupted by the second
World War, resumed its theatrical performances in 1953.</p>
<p>To make watches a spiral spring was substituted (c. 1450) for the
hanging weight: a band of fine steel, rolled up into a small circle or
drum, produced, by its gradual unwinding, the effect of the weight on
the retarded wheel. By the end of the fifteenth century watches were
numerous, some as large as a hand, some as small as an almond, many
ovoid like the “Nuremberg eggs” made by Peter Hele ( 1 5 10). The
principle of weight, escapement, and wheel was applied to other
purposes, so that the mechanical clock became the parent of a myriad
diverse machines.</p>
<p>While physics thus foreshadowed the Industrial Revolution, alchemy
slowly grew into chemistry. By the close of this age the alchemists had
dis- covered and described zinc, bismuth, liver of sulfur, regulus of
antimony, volatile fluorine of alkali, and many other substances. They
distilled alcohol, volatilized mercury, and made sulfuric acid by the
sublimation of sulfur. They prepared ether and aqua regia, and a scarlet
dye superior to those now used. 42 They bequeathed to chemistry the
experimental method that would prove the greatest gift of medieval
science to the modern mind.</p>
<p>Botany was still mostly confined to manuals of husbandry or to
herbals describing medicinal plants. Henry of Hesse ( 1325-97) suggested
that new species, especially among plants, might evolve naturally from
old ones; 43 this 500 years before Darwin. Royal or papal menageries,
animal breeding, veterinary medicine, treatises on hunting or fishing or
the culture of bees or</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 243</p>
<p>silkworms, bestiaries that told animal stories to insinuate morality,
and books on falconry, like the Miroir de Phoebus (1387) of Gaston III
Count of Foix, half unwittingly gathered material for a science of
zoology.</p>
<p>Anatomy and physiology had for the most part to depend upon the dis-
section. of animals, the wounds of soldiers, and occasional cases where
the law required post-mortem autopsy. Honest Christians felt reasonable
ob- jections to the dissection of human bodies which, however dead, were
sup- posed to rise intact from the grave at the Last Judgment. All
through the fourteenth century it was difficult to get cadavers for
anatomical study; north of the Alps very few physicians, before 1450,
had ever seen a dissected human corpse. Nevertheless, about 1360, Guy de
Chauliac persuaded the au- thorities at Avignon (then ruled by the papal
court) to turn over to medical schools, for dissection, the bodies of
executed criminals. 44 Dissections were performed before medical
students at Venice in 1368, Montpelier in 1377, Florence in
i388,Leridain 1391, Vienna in 1404; and in 1445 the University of Padua
built the first known anatomical theater. The results for medicine were
endless.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE HEALERS</li>
</ol>
<p>In the science and practice of medicine, as in literature and art,
northern Europe was half a century or more behind Italy; and even Italy
had by 1300 barely regained the medical knowledge reached by Galen and
Soranus a thousand years before. But the medical schools at Montpelier,
Paris, and Ox- ford were malting good progress, and the greatest
surgeons of this age were French. The profession was now well organized,
and defended its privileges lustily; but as the demand for health always
exceeded the supply, herbalists, apothecaries, midwives, wandering
leeches, and barber surgeons — not to men- tion quacks — everywhere
competed with trained practitioners. The public, inviting disease by
wrong living, and then seeking infallible diagnoses and cheap overnight
cures, made the usual complaints about mercenary or mur- derous doctors.
Froissart considered it “the object of all medical men to gain large
salaries” 45 — as if this were not a disease endemic to all
civilization.</p>
<p>The most interesting medical men of the age were the surgeons. They
had not yet persuaded the physicians to recognize them as equals;
indeed, the University of Paris would admit no student to its school of
medicine in the fourteenth century except on his oath never to perform a
surgical operation. Even bloodletting, which had already become a
panacea, was forbidden to physicians, and had to be left to their
underlings. Barbers were still used by the people for many operations;
but the barber surgeons were now abandon- ing tonsorial practice, and
were specializing in surgery; in 1365 there were forty such barber
surgeons in Paris; in England they continued till 1540.</p>
<p>244 THE Reformation (chap. xii</p>
<p>An ordinance of 1372 restricted them in France to the treatment of “
wounds not of a character likely to cause death”; and thereafter major
operations could be legally performed only by “master surgeons”
dedicated to their specialty. A Royal College of Surgeons was chartered
at Edinburgh in 1505.</p>
<p>The great names in surgery, in the first half of the fourteenth
century, were Henri de Mondeville and Guy de Chauliac. Froissart might
have noted that Mondeville, though always in great demand, remained poor
to the end of his days, and carried on his work despite his own asthma
and tuberculosis. His Chirurgia (1306-20), the first work on surgery by
a Frenchman,</p>
<p>covered the whole field with a thoroughness and competence that
earned a new standing for surgeons. His distinctive contribution was the
application and development of a method which he had learned from
Theodoric Bor- gognoni at Bologna for treating wounds by complete
cleansing, prevention of suppuration, exclusion of air, and dressings
with wine. He defended his innovations by warning against a supine
acceptance of Galen or other classic authorities. “Modern authors,” he
wrote, using a favorite medieval adjective,</p>
<p>The generation after him produced the most famous of medieval
surgeons. Born of peasant stock in the French village that gave him its
name, Guy de Chauliac so impressed the lords of the manor that they paid
his tuition at Toulouse, Montpelier, Bologna, and Paris. In 1 342 he
became papal physician at Avignon, and held that difficult position for
twenty-eight years. When the Black Death struck Avignon he stayed at his
post, ministered to the victims, contracted the pestilence, and barely
survived. Like any man, he committed serious errors: he blamed the
plague now on an unfortunate con- junction of planets, now on Jews
aiming to poison all Christendom; and he retarded the surgery of wounds
by rejecting Mondeville’ s simple cleansing method and returning to the
use of plasters and salves. But for the most part he lived up to the
finest traditions of his great profession. His Chirurgia magna (1363)
was the most thorough, systematic, and learned treatise on surgery
produced before the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Social and individual hygiene hardly kept pace with the advances of
medi- cine. Personal cleanliness was not a fetish; even the King of
England bathed only once a week, and sometimes skipped. The Germans had
public baths — large vats in which the bathers stood or sat naked,
sometimes both sexes to- gether; 47 Ulm alone had 168 such Badestuben in
1489. In all Europe — not always excepting the aristocracy — the same
article of clothing was worn for months, or years, or generations. Many
cities had a water supply, but it reached only a few homes; most
families had to fetch water from the nearest fountain, well, or spring.
The air of London was befouled by the odor of slaughtered cattle, till
such carnage was forbidden in 1371. The smell of</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 245</p>
<p>latrines detracted from the idyllic fantasies of rural life. London
tenements had but one latrine for all occupants; many houses had none at
all, and emptied their ordure into the yards or streets. Thousands of
privies poured into the Thames; a city ordinance of 1357 denounced this,
but the practice continued. In 1388, prodded by several returns of the
plague, Parliament passed the first Sanitary Act for all England:</p>
<p>For that so much dung and filth of the garbage and entrails, as
well</p>
<p>of beasts killed as of other corruptions, be cast and put in
ditches,</p>
<p>rivers, and other waters . . . that the air is greatly corrupt and
infect, and many maladies and other intolerable diseases do daily
happen, as well to inhabitants … as to others repairing or traveling
thither . . .</p>
<p>it is accorded and assented, That proclamation be made . . .
throughout the realm of England . . . that all they which do cast and
lay all such</p>
<p>annoyances . . . shall cause them utterly to be removed . . . upon
pain to lose and forfeit to our Lord the King. 48</p>
<p>Similar ordinances were promulgated in France about this time. In
1383 Marseille, following the example of Ragusa (1377), ordered the
isolation of plague-stricken persons for forty days — a quarantine.
Epidemics continued to occur — the sweating sickness in England (i486,
1508), diphtheria and smallpox in Germany (1492) — but with diminished
virulence and mortality. Though sanitation was lax, hospitals were
relatively abundant; in 1500 Eng- land had 460, York alone had sixteen.
49</p>
<p>The treatment of the insane gradually passed from superstitious
reverence or barbaric cruelty to semi-scientific care. In 1300 the
corpse of a girl who had claimed to be the Holy Ghost was dug up and
burned by ecclesiastical order, and two women who expressed belief in
her claim perished at the stake. 50 In 1359 the Archbishop of Toledo
commissioned the civil authorities to burn alive a Spaniard who
professed to be a brother of the Archangel Michael, and to visit heaven
and hell daily. 51 Matters improved in the fif- teenth century. A monk
named Jean Joffre, filled with compassion for lunatics who were being
hooted through the streets of Valladolid by a mob, established there an
asylum for the insane (1409); and his example was fol- lowed in other
cities. The hospital of St. Mary of Bethlehem, founded in London in
1247, was transformed into an insane asylum in 1402, and the word
Bethlehem, corrupted into Bedlam, became a synonym for a place of
insanity.</p>
<p>Confirmed lepers were still outcast from society, but leprosy almost
dis- appeared from Western Europe in the fifteenth century. Syphilis
took its place. Possibly a development of the gros verole previously
known in France, possibly an importation from America,* it appeared
definitely in Spain in Cf. The Reims sctnce, pp. 534-7.</p>

<p>1493, in Italy in 1495; it spread so widely in France that it came to
be called morbus gallicus and some cities in Germany were so ravaged by
it that they begged exemption from taxation. 52 As early as the end of
the fifteenth cen- tury we hear of mercury being used in treating it.
The progress of medicine ran a brave race then as now with the
inventiveness of disease.</p>
<p>V. THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>Though the age of the system-makers had passed, philosophy was still
vigorous; indeed in the fourteenth century it shook the whole dogmatic
structure of Christendom. A change of emphasis ended the sway of the
theologians in philosophy: the leading thinkers now took a major
interest in science, like Buridan, or in economics, like Oresme, or in
Church organi- zation, like Nicholas of Cusa, or in politics, like
Pierre Dubois and Marsilius of Padua. Intellectually these men were
quite the equal of Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Siger de Brabant,
Bonaventura, and Duns Scotus.</p>
<p>Scholasticism — both as a method of argument and exposition and as an
at- tempt to show the consistency of reason with faith — continued to
dominate the northern universities. Aquinas was canonized in 1323;
thereafter his fel- low Dominicans, especially at Louvain and Cologne,
felt it a point of honor to maintain his doctrine against all
challenges. The Franciscans, as a loyal op- position, preferred to
follow Augustine and Duns Scotus. One unmoored Dominican, William Durand
of Saint-Pour§ain, shocked his order by going over to the Scotists. At
thirty-eight (c. 1308) he began a vast commentary, which he finished in
old age. As he progressed he abandoned Aristotle and Aquinas, and
proposed to put reason above the authority of “any doctor, however
famous or solemn”— here was a philosopher with some sense of humor. 53
While remaining overtly orthodox in theology, he prepared for the
uncompromising nominalism of Ockham by restoring the conceptualism of
Abelard: only individual things exist; all abstract or general ideas are
merely the useful shorthand concepts of the mind. William’s friends
called him Doctor Resolutissimus; his opponents called him Durus
Durandus-Du- rand the Hard — and warmed themselves with the hope that
the fires of hell would soften him at last.</p>
<p>William of Ockham was much harder, but did not wait till death to
burn; his whole life was one of hot controversy, cooled only by
occasional im- prisonment, and the compulsion of the times to phrase his
heat in Scholastic form. He admitted in philosophy no authority but
experience and reason. He took his theorems passionately, and set half
of Europe by the ears in defending his views. His life, adventures, and
aims prefigure Voltaire’s, and perhaps his effect was as great.</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 247</p>
<p>We cannot say precisely where or when he was born; probably at Ockham
in Surrey, toward the end of the thirteenth century. While yet young he
entered the Franciscan order, and about the age of twelve he was sent to
Oxford as a bright lad who would surely be a shining light in the
Church. At Oxford, and perhaps at Paris, he felt the influence of
another subtle Franciscan, Duns Sco tus; for though he opposed the
“realism” of Scotus, he carried his predecessor’s rationalist critique
of philosophy and theology many steps further to a skepticism that would
dissolve alike religious dogmas and scientific laws. He taught for six
years at Oxford, and may have taught at Paris. Apparently before 1324 —
while still a tyro in his twenties — he wrote commentaries on Aristotle
and Peter Lombard, and his most influential book, Suinma totius logicae
— a summary of all logic.</p>
<p>It seems at first sampling to be a dreary desert of logic-chopping
and tech- nical terminology, a lifeless procession of definitions,
divisions, subdivisions, distinctions, classifications, and subtleties.
Ockham knew all about “seman - tics”; he deplored the inaccuracy of the
terms used in philosophy, and spent half his time trying to make them
more precise. He resented the Gothic edifice of abstractions — one
mounted upon the other like arches in super- imposed tiers — that
medieval thought had raised. We cannot find in his extant works
precisely the famous formula that tradition called “Ockham’s razor”:
entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem — entities are not to
be multiplied beyond need. But he expressed the principle in other terms
again and again: pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate — a
plurality (of entities or causes or factors) is not to be posited (or
assumed) without necessity; 64 and frustra fit per plura quod potest
fieri per pauciora — it is vain to seek to accomplish or explain by
assuming several entities or causes what can be explained by fewer. 55
The principle was not new; Aquinas had accepted it, Scotus had used it.
56 But in Ockham’s hands it became a deadly weapon, cutting away a
hundred occult fancies and grandiose abstractions.</p>
<p>Applying the principle to epistemology, Ockham judged it needless to
assume, as the source and material of knowledge, anything more than
sensa- tions. From these arise memory (sensation revived), perception
(sensation interpreted through memory), imagination (memories combined),
antici- pation (memory projected), thought (memories compared), and
experience (memories interpreted through thought). “Nothing can be an
object of the nterior sense” (thought) “without having been an object of
the exterior jense” (sensation); 67 here is Locke’s empiricism 300 years
before Locke. All that we ever perceive outside ourselves is individual
entities — specific persons, places, things, actions, shapes, colors,
tastes, odors, pressures, tem- peratures, sounds; and the words by which
we denote these are “words of first intention” or primary intent,
directly referring to what we interpret as external realities. By noting
and abstracting the common features of simi-</p>
<p>248 THE REFORMATION (CHAP, xn</p>
<p>lar entities so perceived, we may arrive at general or abstract ideas
— man, virtue, height, sweetness, heat, music, eloquence; and the words
by which we denote such abstractions are “words of second intention,”
referring t o conceptions derived from perceptions. These “universals”
are never experi - enced in sensation; they are termini , signa, nomina
— terms, signs, names — for generalizations extremely useful (and
dangerous) in thought or reason, in science, philosophy, and theology;
they are not objects existing outside the mind. “Everything outside the
mind is singular, numerically one .” 58 Reason is magnificent, but its
conclusions have meaning only in so far as they refer to experience —
i.e., to the perception of individual entities, or the perform- ance of
individual acts; otherwise its conclusions are vain and perhaps decep-
tive abstractions. How much nonsense is talked or written by mistaking
ideas for things, abstractions for realities! Abstract thought fulfills
its function only when it leads to specific statements about specific
things.</p>
<p>From this “nominalism” Ockham moved with devastating recklessness
into every field of philosophy and theology. Both metaphysics and
science, he announced, are precarious generalizations, since our
experience is only of individual entities in a narrowly restricted area
and time; it is mere arro- gance on our part to assume the universal and
eternal validity of the general propositions and “natural laws” that we
derive from this tiny sector of reality. Our knowledge is molded and
limited by our means and ways of perceiving things (this is Kant before
Kant) ; it is locked up in the prison of our minds, and it must not
pretend to be the objective or ultimate truth about anything . 50</p>
<p>As for the soul, it too is an abstraction. It never appears in our
sensations or perceptions, external or internal; all that we perceive is
will, the ego asserting itself in every action and thought. Reason
itself and all the glory of intellect are tools of the will; the
intellect is merely the will thinking, seeking its ends by thought . 00
(This is Schopenhauer.)</p>
<p>God Himself seems to fall before this razor philosophy. Ockham (like
Kant) found no conclusive force in any of the arguments used to prove
the existence of deity. He rejected Aristotle’s notion that the chain of
motions or causes compels us to assume a Prime Mover or First Cause; an
“infinite regress” of motions or causes is no more inconceivable than
the unmoved M over or uncaused Cause of Aristotle’s theology . 01 Since
nothing can be known save through direct perception, we can never have
any clear knowl- edge that God exists — non potest sciri evidenter quod
Deus est . 02 That God is omnipotent or infinite, omniscient or
benevolent or personal, cannot be shown by reason; much less can reason
prove that there are three persons in one God, or that God became man to
atone for Adam and Eve’s disobe - dience, or that the Son of God is

<p>monotheism more rational than polytheism; there may be more worlds
than one, and more gods to govern them. 64</p>
<p>What then remained of the majestic edifice of Christian faith, its
lovely myths and songs and art, its God-given morality, its fortifying
hope? Ock- ham recoiled before the ruin of theology by reason, and in a
desperate effort to save a social order based on a moral code based on
religious belief, he proposed at last to sacrifice reason on the altar
of faith. Though it cannot be proved, it is probable that God exists,
and that He has endowed each of us with an immortal soul. 88 We must
distinguish (as Averroes and Duns Scotus had advised) between
theological truth and philosophical truth, and humbly accept in faith
what proud reason doubts.</p>
<p>It was too much to expect that this caudal appendage in honor of
“practi - cal reason” would be accepted by the Church as atoning for
Ockham’s critique of pure reason. Pope John XXII ordered an
ecclesiastical inquiry into the “abominable heresies” of the young
friar, and summoned him to appear at the papal court in Avignon. Ockham
came, for we find him, in 1328, in a papal prison there, with two other
Franciscans. The three escaped, and fled to Aiguesmortes; they embarked
in a small boat, and were picked up by a galley that took them to Louis
of Bavaria at Pisa. The Pope excommu- nicated them, the Emperor
protected them. William accompanied Louis to Munich, joined Marsilius of
Padua there, lived in an anti-papal Franciscan monastery, and issued
from it a torrent of books and pamphlets against the power and heresies
of the popes in general, and of John XXII in particular.</p>
<p>As he had in his metaphysics outdone the skepticism of Scotus, so now
in his practical theory Ockham carried to daring conclusions the
anticleri- calism of Marsilius of Padua. He applied his “razor” to the
dogmas and rites that the Church had added to early Christianity, and
demanded a return to the simpler creed and worship of the New Testament.
In a pugnacious Centiloquium theologicum he brought before the tribunal
of his reason a hundred dogmas of the Church, and argued that many of
them led logically to intolerable absurdities. If, for example, Mary is
the Mother of God, and God is father of us all, Mary is the mother of
her father. 80 Ockham ques- tioned the Apostolic Succession of the
popes, and their infallibility; on the contrary, he urged, many of them
had-been heretics, and some had been criminals. 87 He advocated a
lenient treatment of heresy, proposing that all expression of opinion be
left free except for the dissemination of conscious falsehood. 88 What
Christianity needed, he thought, was a return from the Church to Christ,
from wealth and power to simplicity of life and humility of rule. T. he
Church should be defined not as the clergy alone but as the whole
Christian community. This entire fellowship, including the women, should
choose representatives, including women, to a general council, and</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>(CHAJP. XII</p>
<p>this council should choose and govern the pope. Church and state
should be under one head. 69</p>
<p>The state itself should be subject to the will of the people, for in
them is vested all final sovereignty on the earth. They delegate their
right of legislation and administration to a king or emperor on the
understanding that he will enact laws for the welfare of all. If the
common good requires it, private property may be abolished. 70 If the
ruler commits a great crime, or is guilty of negligence so extreme that
it threatens the survival of the state, the people may justly depose
him.</p>
<p>We know little of Ockham’s fate. The beer of Munich could not console
him for the lost wine of Paris. He compared himself to John the
Evangelist on Patmos, but he dared not leave the protective orbit of the
Emperor. Ac- cording to a Franciscan chronicler the rebel in his final
years signed a recan- tation of his heresies. Perhaps the reconciliation
of Louis with the Church made this advisable; and William may have come
to feel that to question the truth of a religion’s dogmas is jejune. He
died of the Black Death in 1 349 or 1350, still in the prime of life.
71</p>
<p>Long before his death he was recognized as the most forceful thinker
of his age, and the universities shook with disputes over his
philosophy. Many theologians accepted his view that the basic tenets of
the Christian religion could not be proved by reason; 72 and the
distinction between philosophical truth and religious truth was as
widely spread in the fourteenth century as is today the tacit truce
between scientific inquiry and religious ministrations. At Oxford a
school of Ockhamists took form, called itself the via moderna (as
Abelard had called his conceptualism 300 years before), and smiled at
the metaphysical realism of Scotus and Aquinas. 78 The modernists were
espe- cially victorious in the universities of Central Europe; Huss at
Prague and Luther at Erfurt were taught nominalism, and may have been
conditioned by it for their revolt. At Paris the university authorities
forbade (1339-40) the teaching of Ockham’s views, but many of the
students, and some masters, acclaimed him as the standard-bearer of free
thought, and more than once the opposed factions, as in our times,
fought with words and fists in the cafes or the streets. 74 It was
probably in reaction against Ockhamism that Thomas i Kempis condemned
philosophy in The Imitation of Christ.</p>
<p>Ockham played a part, if only as a voice, in the uprising of the
nationalist state against the universalist Church. His propaganda for
ecclesiastical pov- erty influenced Wyclif, and his assaults upon the
papacy, as well as his constant appeal from the Church to the Bible and
early Christianity, pre- pared for Luther, who ranked Ockham as the
“chiefest and most ingenious of Scholastic doctors.” 78 His voluntarism
and individualism expressed in advance the heady spirit of the
Renaissance. His skepticism passed down to Ramus and Montaigne, perhaps
to Erasmus; his subjectivist limitation of</p>
<p>THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>knowledge to ideas foreshadowed Berkeley; his attempt to rescue faith
through “practical reason” anticipated Kant. Though philosophically an
idealist, his emphasis on sensation as the sole source of knowledge gave
him a place in the procession of empirical English philosophy from Roger
and Francis Bacon through Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Mill, and Spencer to
Bertrand Russell. His occasional sallies into physical science — his
perception of a law of inertia, his doctrine of action at a distance —
stimulated thinkers from Jean Buridan to Isaac Newton. 76 The general
effect of his work, like that of Duns Scotus, was to undermine the basic
assumption of Scholasticism — that medi- eval Christian dogma could be
proved by reason. Scholasticism maintained till the seventeenth century
a pallid post-mortem existence, but it never recovered from these
blows.</p>

<li>THE REFORMERS</li>
</ol>
<p>While ibn-Khaldun was founding sociology in Islam, Pierre Dubois,</p>
<p>Nicole Oresme, Marsilius of Padua, and Nicholas of Cusa were
developing kindred studies, less systematically, in Christendom. Dubois
served Philip IV of France as Ockham and Marsilius served Louis of
Bavaria, by aiming in- tellectual broadsides against the papacy, and
singing doxologies to the state. In a Supplication du peuple de France
au roi contrele pape Boniface (1308), and in a treatise De recuperatione
terre sancte ( On the Recapture of the Holy Land , 1305), the ardent
lawyer recommended that the papacy should shed all its temporal
possessions and powers, that the rulers of Europe should repudiate the
papal authority in their realms, and that the French Church should
divorce itself from Rome and submit to secular authority and law.
Moreover, proceeded Dubois, all Europe should be united under the French
king as emperor, with his capital at Constantinople as a bastion against
Islam. An international court should be established to adjudicate the
quarrels of nations, and an economic boycott should be declared against
any Christian nation that should open war against another. Women should
have the same educational opportunities and political rights as men.</p>
<p>No one seemed to pay much attention to these proposals, but they</p>
<p>entered into the intellectual currents that undermined the papacy.
Two cen- turies after Dubois, Henry VIII, who doubtless had never heard
of him, fol- lowed his program, and Wyclif’s, in religion; and in the
early nineteenth century Napoleon set up for a moment a united Europe
under French lead- ership, with the pope a captive of the state. Dubois
belonged to that rising legal profession which aspired to replace the
clergy in administering the gov- ernment. He won his battle; we live in
the heyday of his victory.</p>
<p>Oresme, who stirred so manv nools, wrote toward 1355 one of the
clearest</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>2 5 2</p>
<p>(CHAP. Xli</p>
<p>and most straightforward essays in all economic literature — On the
Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money. The money of a country,
he argued, belongs to the community, not to the king; it is a social
utility, not a royal perquisite; the ruler or government may regulate
its issue, but should make no profit from minting it, and should
maintain its metallic quality undebased. A king who dilutes the coinage
is a thief. 77 Moreover, bad money (as “Gres - ham’s Law” would say two
centuries later) drives good money out of circu - lation; people will
secrete or export good coin, and the dishonest government will receive
in its revenues only its depreciated currency. These ideas of Oresme
were not merely ideals; he taught them, as tutor, to the son of John II.
When his pupil became Charles V, the young King, after one desperate
devaluation, profited from his teacher’s instruction by restoring the sh
attered finances of war-ridden France to a sound and honest basis.</p>
<p>Marsilius of Padua was of more volatile temperament than Oresme: an
uncompromising individualist proud of his intellect and courage, and
making his political philosophy an inextricable part of his hectic life.
Son of a notary in Padua, he studied medicine at the university;
probably he owed some of his anticlerical radicalism to the atmosphere
of Averroistic skepticism that Petrarch found and denounced there in the
same generation. Passing to Paris, he became for a year rector of the
university. In 1324, with the minor collab- oration of John of Jandun,
he composed the most remarkable and influential political treatise of
the Middle Ages — Defensor pads (The Defender of Peace). Knowing that
the book must be condemned by the Church, the authors fled to Nuremberg
and placed themselves under the wing of the Emperor Louis of Bavaria,
then at war with the pope.</p>
<p>They could not have expected so lusty a fighter as John XXII to
take</p>
<p>calmly their bellicose defense of peace. The book argued that the
peace of Europe was being destroyed by strife between state and Church,
and that peace could be restored and best maintained by bringing the
Church, with all her property and personnel, under the same Imperial or
royal authority as other groups and goods. It was (ran the argument) a
mistake for the Church ever to have acquired property; nothing in
Scripture justified such acquisition.</p>
<p>Like Ockham, the authors defined the Church as the whole body of
Chris- tians. As the Roman people, in Roman law, was the real sovereign,
and merely delegated its authority to consuls, senate, or emperors, so
the Christian com- munity should delegate, but should never surrender,
its powers to its repre- sentatives, the clergy; and these should be
held responsible to the people whom they represent. The derivation of
the papal supremacy from the Apostle Peter is, in Marsilius’s view, an
historical error; Peter had no more authority than the other Apostles,
and the bishops of Rome, in their first three centuries, had no more
authority than the bishops of several other</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 253</p>
<p>ancient capitals. Not the pope but the emperor or his delegates
presided over the first general councils. A general council, freely
elected by the people of Christendom, should interpret the Scriptures,
define the Catholic faith, and choose the cardinals, who should choose
the pope. 78 In all temporal matters the clergy, including the pope,
should be subject to civil jurisdiction and law. The state should
appoint and remunerate the clergy, fix the number of churches and
priests, remove such priests as it finds unworthy, take control of
ecclesiastical endowments, schools, and income, and relieve the poor out
of the surplus revenues of the Church. 79</p>
<p>Here again was the strident voice of the upsurging national state.
Having, through the support of the rising middle classes, subdued the
barons and the communes, the kings now felt strong enough to repudiate
the claims of the Church to sovereignty over the civil power. Seizing
the opportunity pre- sented by the deterioration of the Church’s
international and intellectual authority, the secular rulers now dreamed
of mastering every phase of life in their realms, including religion and
the Church. This was the basic issue that would be fought out in the
Reformation; and the triumph of the state over the Church would mark one
terminus of the Middle Ages. (In 1535 Henry VIII, at the height of his
revolt against the Church, had the Defensor pads translated and
published at governmental expense.)</p>
<p>Marsilius, like Ockham and Luther, after proposing to replace the</p>
<p>authority of the Church with that of the people, was compelled, both
for social order and for his own security, to replace it with the
authority of the state. But he did not raise the kings into ogres of
omnipotence. He looked beyond the triumph of the state to the day when
the people might actually exercise the sovereignty that legal theorists
had long affected to vest in them. In ecclesiastical reform- he
advocated democracy: each Christian community should choose its
representative to church councils, each parish should choose its own
priests, control them, dismiss them if need should be; and no member of
the parish should be excommunicated without its consent. Marsilius ap-
plied similar principles to civil government, but with hesitant
modifications:</p>
<p>We declare, according to truth and the opinion of Aristotle, that</p>
<p>the legislator — the prime and proper effective cause of law — should
be the people, the whole body of citizens, or its weightier part (valen-
tiorem partem ), commanding or deciding by its own choice or will,</p>
<p>expressed verbally in a general assembly of the citizens. … I say</p>
<p>weightier part, taking into consideration both the number of persons,
and their quality, in the community for which the law is enacted. The
whole body of citizens, or its weightier part, either makes law directly
or commits this duty to some one or a few; but the latter do not, and
cannot, constitute the legislator in the strict sense of the term; they
act only in such matters, and for such periods, as are covered by
the</p>
<p>2 54</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>authorization from the primary legislator. … I call citizen him
who</p>
<p>participates in the civil community with either deliberative or
judicial authority, according to his rank. By this definition boys,
slaves, aliens, and women are distinguished from citizens. . . . Only
out of the de-</p>
<p>liberation and will of the whole multitude is the best law
produced.</p>
<p>… A majority, more readily than any of its parts, can discern the
de-</p>
<p>fects in a law proposed for enactment, for an entire body is greater
in power and worth than any of its separate parts. 80</p>
<p>This is a remarkable statement for its time (1324), and the
conditions of the age justify its hesitations. Even Marsilius would not
advocate equal suf- frage for all adults in a Europe where hardly one
person in ten could read, communication was difficult, and class
divisions were mortised in the cement of time. Indeed, he rejected
complete democracy, wherein policy and legis- lation would be determined
by a count of noses ( egenorum multitudo —“a multitude of needy
people”); and to correct this “corruption of a republic” he was willing
that individuals should have political power commensurate with their
value to the community — though he did not say how or by whom this was
to be judged. He left room for monarchy, but added that “a ruler who is
elected is greatly to be preferred to rulers who are hereditary.” 81 The
king is to be a delegate and servant of the public; and if he seriously
mis- behaves it may rightly depose him. 82</p>
<p>These ideas had a medieval, even an ancient, origin: the Roman
lawyers and the Scholastic philosophers had regularly endowed the people
with a theoretical sovereignty; the papacy itself was an elective
monarchy; the pope called himself servus servorum Dei — “servant of the
servants of God”; and Thomas Aquinas had agreed with John of Salisbury
on the right of the people to overthrow a lawless king. But rarely in
Christendom had these ideas been extended to so explicit a formulation
of representative government. Here in one man, in the fourteenth
century, were the ideas of both the Prot- estant Reformation and the
French Revolution.</p>
<p>Marsilius was too far ahead of his time to be comfortable. He rose
rapidly with Louis of Bavaria, and fell rapidly with his fall. When
Louis made peace with the popes he was required to dismiss Marsilius as
a heretic. We do not know the sequel. Apparently Marsilius died in 1343,
an outcast alike from the Church that he had fought and from the state
that he had labored to exalt.</p>
<p>His temporary success would have been impossible had not the rising
legal profession given to the state an authority rivaling that of the
Church. Over the ruins of feudal and communal law, beside and often
against the canon law of the Church, the lawyers raised the “positive
law” of the state; and year</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE 255</p>
<p>divine right and absolute power for their royal masters. These ideas
were strongest in F ranee, where they evolved into L’etat e’est mot and
Leroi soleil; they prevailed also in Spain, preparing the absolutism of
Ferdinand, Charles V, and Philip II; and even in parliamentary England
Wyclif expounded the unlimited authority of the divine king. Lords and
commons opposed the theory, and Sir John Fortescue insisted that the
English king could not issue laws without the consent of Parliament, and
that English judges were bound, by their oath, to judge by the law of
the land, whatever the king might de- sire; but under Henry VII, Henry
VIII, and Elizabeth, England too would kneel to absolute rulers. Between
the rival absolutisms of popes and kings some idealistic spirits clung
to the notion of a “natural law,” a divine justice implanted in the
human conscience, phrased in the Gospels, and superior to any law of
man. Neither the state nor the Church paid more than lip service to this
conception; it remained in the background, professed and ignored, but
ever faintly alive. In the eighteenth century it would father the
American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the
Rights of Man, and would play a minor but eloquent role in a revolution
that for a time upset both the absolutisms that had ruled mankind.</p>
<p>Nicholas of Cusa fought, and then resigned himself to, the absolutism
of the papacy. In his varied career he showed the best face of organized
Chris- tianity to a Germany always suspicious of the Church. Philosopher
and ad- ministrator, theologian and legist, mystic and scientist, he
combined in one powerful personality the best constituents of those
Middle Ages that were closing with his life. Born at Cues, near Trier (
1 40 1 ) , he learned a medley of scholarship and devotion in the school
of the Brethren of the Common Life at Deventer. In a year at Heidelberg
he felt the influence of Ockham’s nominalism; at Padua he was touched
for a time with the skepticism of Averroes; at Cologne he absorbed the
orthodox tradition of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas; all the
elements were mixed in him that would make him the most complete
Christian of his time.</p>
<p>He never quite abandoned the mystical mood that had reached him from
Meister Eckhart; he wrote a classic of mysticism in De visione Dei ; and
in a philosophic defense of such visions (Apologia doctae ignorantiae)
he coined a famous phrase — “learned ignorance.” He rejected the
Scholastic rationalism that sought to prove theology by reason; all
human knowledge, he felt, is relative and uncertain; truth is hidden in
God. 83 Generally he rejected astrol- ogy; but, succumbing to the
delusions of his epoch, he indulged in some astrological calculations,
and reckoned that the end of the world would come in 1734. 84 Amid a
life crowded with ecclesiastical activity he kept abreast of scientific
thought. He urged more experiment and more accurate measurements; he
suggested timing the fall of different bodies from different heights; he
taught that the earth “cannot be fixed, but moves like other</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>stars”; 85 every star, however fixed it may seem, moves; no orbit is
precisely circular; the earth is not the center of the universe, except
in so far as any point may be taken as the center of an infinite
universe. 86 These were some- times judicious borrowings, sometimes
brilliant aperpus.</p>
<p>In 143 3 Nicholas went to Basel to present to the ecclesiastical
council there the claims of a friend to the archiepiscopal see of
Cologne. His plea failed, but he took the opportunity of presenting to
the council — then at odds with the pope — a work of some moment in the
history of philosophy. He called it De concordantia Catholica, and its
general purpose was to find terms of ac- cord between the councils and
the popes. In an elaborate analogy with a liv- ing organism, he pictured
the Church as an organic unity, incapable of successful functioning
except through the harmonious co-operation of its parts. Instead of
concluding, as the popes might have done, that the parts should be
guided by the head, Nicholas argued that only a general council could
represent, express, and unify the interdependent elements of the Church.
He repeated Aquinas and Marsilius, and almost plagiarized Rousseau and
Jefferson, in an idealistic passage:</p>
<p>Every law depends upon the law of nature; and if it contradicts
this</p>
<p>it cannot be a valid law. . . . Since by nature all men are free,
then every government . . . exists solely by the agreement and consent
of the sub- jects The binding power of any law consists in this tacit or
explicit</p>
<p>agreement and consent. 87</p>
<p>The sovereign people delegates its powers to small groups equipped by
edu- cation or experience to make or administer laws; but these groups
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. When the
Christian com- munity delegates its powers to a general council of the
Church, that council, and not the pope, represents the sovereign
authority in religion. Nor can the pope rest his claim to legislative
absolutism on the supposed Donation of Constantine, for that Donation is
a forgery and a myth. 88 A pope has a right to summon a general council,
but such a council, if it judges him unfit, may rightly depose him. And
the same principles hold for secular princes. An elective monarchy is
probably the best government available to mankind in its present
depraved condition; but the secular ruler, like the pope, should
periodically convene a representative assembly, and should submit to its
decrees.’</p>
<p>Nicholas’ later life was a model for prelates. Made a cardinal
(1448), he became in person a Catholic Reformation. In a strenuous tour
through the Netherlands and Germany, he held provincial synods, revived
ecclesiastical discipline, reformed the monasteries and nunneries,
attacked priestly con- cubinage, furthered the education of the clergy,
and raised, at least for a time, the level of clerical and popular
morality. “Nicholas of Cusa,” wrote</p>
<p>THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>chap, xn)</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>the learned Abbot Trithemius, “appeared in Germany as an angel of
light and peace amid darkness and confusion. He restored the unity of
the Chi rch, strengthened the authority of her Supreme Head, and sowed a
precious seed of new life .” 89</p>
<p>To his other titles Nicholas could have added that of humanist. He
loved the ancient classics, encouraged their study, and planned to print
for wide circulation the Greek manuscripts that he himself had brought
from Con- stantinople. He had the true scholar’s tolerance. In a
Dialogue on Peace , com - posed in the very year when Constantinople
fell to the Turks, he pleaded for mutual understanding among the
religions as diverse rays of one eternal truth . 90 And in the dawn of
modern thought, when the rising freedom of the intellect was an
intoxication, he wrote sound and noble words:</p>
<p>To know and to think, to see the truth with the eye of the mind,
is</p>
<p>always a joy. The older a man grows, the greater is the pleasure that
this affords him. … As love is the life of the heart, so is the endeavor
after knowledge and truth the life of the mind. Amid the movements of
time, the daily labor, perplexities, and contradictions of life, we</p>
<p>should lift our gaze fearlessly to the clear vault of heaven, and
seek</p>
<p>ever to obtain a firmer grasp of . . . the origin of all goodness
and</p>
<p>beauty, the capacities of our own hearts and minds, the intellectual
fruits of mankind throughout the centuries, and the wonderful works of
Nature around us; but remembering always that in humility alone lies
true greatness, and that knowledge and wisdom are profitable only in so
far as our lives are governed by them . 01</p>
