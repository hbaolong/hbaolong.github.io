<h4 id="chapter-xxxii">CHAPTER XXXII</h4>
<p>The Gothic Flowering</p>
<p>1095-1300</p>
<p>I. THE CATHEDRAL</p>
<p>W HY did Western Europe build so many churches in the three cen-</p>
<p>turies after 1000? What need was there, in a Europe with hardly a</p>
<p>fifth of its present population, for temples so vast that they are
now rarely filled even on the holiest days? How could an agricultural
civilization afford to build such costly edifices, which a wealthy
industrialism can barely main- tain?</p>
<p>The population was small, but it believed; it was poor, but it gave.
On holydays, or in pilgrimage churches, the worshipers were so numerous,
said Suger of St. Denis, that “women were forced to run toward the altar
on the heads of men as a pavement”; 1 the great abbot was raising funds
to build his masterpiece, and could be forgiven a little exaggeration.
In towns like Flor- ence, Pisa, Chartres, York it was desirable on
occasion to gather the entire population into one edifice. In populous
monasteries the abbey church had to accommodate monks and nuns and
laity. Relics had to be guarded in special shrines, with room for
intimate devotion, and a spacious sanctuary was needed for major
rituals. Side altars were required in abbeys and cathe- drals whose many
priests were expected to say Mass every day; a separate altar or chapel
for each favored saint might incline his ear to petitioners; and Mary
had to have a “Lady Chapel” if the whole cathedral was not hers.</p>
<p>The construction was financed largely by the accumulated funds of the
episcopal see. In addition the bishop solicited gifts from kings,
nobles, com- munes, guilds, parishes, and individuals. The communes were
stirred to a wholesome rivalry, in which the cathedral became the symbol
and challenge of their wealth and power. Indulgences were offered to
those who con- tributed; relics were carried about the diocese to
stimulate giving; and gen- erosity might be prodded by an occasional
miracle. 2 Competition for build- ing funds was keen; bishops objected
to collections made in their dioceses for undertakings in another; in
some cases, however, bishops from many parts, even from foreign lands,
sent aid to an enterprise, as at Chartres. Though some of these appeals
verged on pressure, they hardly rivaled the intensity of the influences
mobilized for the public financing of a modern war. The cathedral
chapters exhausted their own funds, and almost bank-</p>
<p>863</p>
<p>864 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>rupted the French Church, in the Gothic ecstasy. The people
themselves did not feel exploited when they contributed; they hardly
missed the mite they individually gave; and for that mite they received,
as a collective achievement and pride, a home for their worship, a
meeting place for their community, a school of letters for their
children, a school of arts and crafts for their guilds, and a Bible in
stone whereby they might contemplate, in statue and picture, the story
of their faith. The house of the people was the house of God.</p>
<p>Who designed the cathedrals? If architecture is the art of designing
and beautifying a building and directing its construction, we must
reject, for Gothic, the old view that the priests or monks were the
architects. Their function was to formulate their needs, conceive a
general plan, secure a lo- cation, and raise funds. Before 1050 it was
usual for the clergy, especially the Cluniac monks, to design and
superintend as well as to plan; but for the great cathedrals — all after
1050 — it was found necessary to engage professional architects who,
with rare exceptions, were neither monks nor priests. The architect
would not receive that title till 1 563; his medieval name was “mas -
ter builder,” sometimes “master mason”; and these terms reveal his
origin. He began as an artisan physically engaged in the work that he
directed. In the thirteenth century, as wealth permitted greater
edifices and specializa- tion, the master builder was one who — no
longer sharing in the physical work — submitted designs and competitive
estimates, accepted contracts, made ground plans and working drawings,
procured materials, hired and paid artists and artisans, and supervised
the construction from beginning to end. We know the names of many such
architects after 1050 — of 137 Gothic architects in medieval Spain
alone. Some of them inscribed their names on their buildings, and a few
wrote books about their craft. Villard de Honne- court (c. 1250) left an
album of architectural notes and sketches made on the travels that he
undertook, in the practice of his profession, from Laon and Reims to
Lausanne and Hungary.</p>
<p>The artists who did the more delicate work — who carved the figures
and reliefs, or painted the windows or the walls, or decorated the altar
or the choir — were not distinguished from the artisans by any special
name; the artist was a master artisan, and every industry strove to be
an art. Much of the work was distributed by contract among the guilds to
which artists and artisans alike belonged. The unskilled labor was
provided by serfs or hired migratory workers; and when time pressed, the
government conscripted men — even skilled artisans — to complete the
task. 3 Hours of labor were from sun- rise to sunset in winter, from a
little after sunrise to a little before sundown in summer, with time
allowed for a substantial meal at noon. English archi- tects, in 1275,
received twelve pence (2) a day, with traveling expenses and occasional
gifts.</p>
<p>The ground plan of the cathedral was still essentially that of the
Roman</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII ) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 865</p>
<p>basilica: a longitudinal nave terminating in a sanctuary and an apse,
and ris- ing above and between two aisles to a roof supported by walls
and colon- nades. By a complex but fascinating evolution this simple
basilica became first the Romanesque, and, then the Gothic, cathedral.
The nave and aisles were cut by a transept — a transverse nave — giving
the plan the figure of a Latin cross. The ground area was enlarged by
rivalry or devotion until Notre Dame at Paris covered 63,000 square
feet, Chartres or Reims 65,000, Amiens 70,000, Cologne 90,000,
St. Peter’s 100,000. The Christian church was almost always oriented —
built with the head or apse pointing eastward — toward Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Hence the main portal was in the west fagade, whose special
decoration received the light of the setting sun. In the great
cathedrals each portal was an archway with “recessed orders”: i.e., the
innermost arch was topped with a larger arch overlapping outward, and
this again with a larger arch, until there might be as many a s eight
such overreaching layers or “orders,” the whole forming an expanding
shell. A similar “subordination of orders,” or gradation of parts,
enhanced the beauty of nave arches and window jambs. Each order or stone
band of the compound arch could receive statuary or other sculptural
ornament, so that the portal, above all in the west front, became a
profuse chapter in the stone book of Christian lore.</p>
<p>The dignity of the west fagade was heightened by flanking it with
towers. Towers are as old as the records of history. In Romanesque and
Gothic they were used not only to house bells, but to support the
lateral pressure of the fagade and the longitudinal pressure of the
aisles. In Normandy and England a third tower had many windows, or was
largely open at the base, and served as a “lantern” to give a natural
light to the center of the church. Gothic architects, enamored of
verticality, aimed to add a spire to every tower; funds or skill or
spirit failed; some spires fell, as at Beauvais; Notre Dame, Amiens, and
Reims received no spires, Chartres only two of its intended three, Laon
one of five — and that was destroyed in the Revolution. As the spire
pointed the landscapes of the North, so the campanile or bell tower
dominated the cities of Italy. There they were usually separate from the
church, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or Giotto’s campanile at
Florence. Possibly they took some hints from Moslem minarets; in turn
they spread their style into Palestine and Syria; and they became the
civic belfries of the northern towns.</p>
<p>Within the church the central aisle, if its flanking colonnades
supported arches curving to meet across the ceiling vault, looked like
the inner hull of an inverted ship, whence its name of nave. The full
impression of its length was sometimes weakened, particularly in
England, by a marble or iron grille, beautifully carved or cast, thrown
across the nave to protect the sanctuary from lay intrusion during
services. In the sanctuary were choir stalls, always works of art; two
pulpits, sometimes called ambos from the Latin word for</p>
<p>866</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>both-, seats for the officiating priests; and the main altar, often
displaying an adorned rear screen or reredos. Around the sanctuary,
continuing the aisles into the apse, ran an ambulatory, designed to
allow processions to make full circuit of the edifice. Beneath the altar
some churches, as if recalling the burial chambers of the Roman
catacombs, built a crypt to hold the relics of a patron saint, or the
bones of the distinguished dead.</p>
<p>The central problem of Romanesque and Gothic architecture was how to
support the roof. Early Romanesque churches had wooden ceilings, usually
of well-seasoned oak; such timbers, if properly ventilated and yet
guarded from damp, would last indefinitely; so the south transept of
Win- chester Cathedral still has its eleventh-century ceiling of wood.
The disad- vantage of such structures lay in the danger of fires, which,
once ignited, were hard to reach. By the twelfth century nearly all
major churches had ceilings of masonry. The weight of these roofs
determined the evolution of medieval European architecture. Much of this
weight had to be borne by the columns that flanked the nave. These had
therefore to be strengthened or multiplied; and this was done by
combining several columns into a cluster, or replacing them by massive
piers of masonry. The column, cluster, or pier was crowned with a
capital, perhaps also with an impost to provide a larger surface to bear
the superincumbent weight. From each pier or column clus- ter rose a fan
of masonry arches: a transverse arch thrown athwart the nave to the
opposite pier; another transverse arch crossing over the aisle to a pier
in the wall; two longitudinal arches to the next pier forward and the
next to the rear; two diagonal arches connecting the pier with
diagonally opposite piers across the nave; and perhaps two diagonal
arches to diagonally oppo- site piers across the aisle. Usually each
arch had its own individual support on the impost or capital of the
pier. Better still, each might be continued in unbroken line to the
ground to form a component of a column cluster or compound pier; the
vertical effect so produced was among the fairest fea- tures of the
Romanesque and Gothic styles. Each quadrangle of piers in nave or aisle
constituted a “bay,” from which the arches rose in graceful in - ward
curvature to form a section of the vault. Externally this ceiling was
covered by a gabled roof of wood, itself hidden and shielded by slate or
tiles.</p>
<p>The vault became the crowning achievement of medieval architecture.
The principle of the arch allowed a greater space to be spanned than had
been practical with timbered ceiling or architrave. The nave could now
be widened to harmonize with greater length; the widened nave required
for proportion a greater height; this allowed the raising of the level
at which the arches sprang inward from piers or walls; and this further
prolongation of the direct shaft again enhanced the breath-taking
verticality of the cathedral lines. The vault became a clearer harmony
when its groins — the lines where the masonry arches met — were edged
with “ribs” of brick or stone. These ribs in turn led to a major
improvement in structure and style: the masons</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII ) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 867</p>
<p>learned to begin the vault by erecting one rib at a time on an easily
movable “centering” or wooden frame; they filled in with light masonry,
one at a time, the triangles between each pair of ribs; this thin web of
masonry was made concave, thereby shifting most of its weight to the
ribs; and the ribs were made strong to channel the downward pressure to
specific points — the piers of nave or wall. The groined and ribbed
vault became the distinctive feature of medieval architecture at its
height.</p>
<p>The problem of supporting the superstructure was further met by
build- ing the nave higher than the aisles; the roof of the aisle, with
the outer wall, thus served as a buttress for the vault of the nave; and
if the aisle itself was vaulted its ribbed arches would channel half
their weight inward to counter the outward pressure of the central vault
at the weakest points of the nave supports. At the same time, that part
of the nave which rose beyond the roofs of the aisles became a
clerestory or clearstory, whose unimpeded windows would illuminate the
nave. The aisles themselves were usually divided into two or three
stories, of which the uppermost constituted a gallery, and the second a
triforium so called because the arched spaces by which it faced the nave
were normally divided by two columns into “three doors.” In East - ern
churches the women were expected to worship there, leaving the nave to
the men.</p>
<p>So, stage by stage, through ten or twenty or a hundred years, the
cathe- dral rose, defying gravity to glorify God. When it was ready for
use it was dedicated in a ceremonious ritual that brought together high
prelates and dignitaries, pilgrims and sightseers, and all the townsfolk
except the village atheist. Years more would be spent in finishing
exterior and interior, and adding a thousand embellishments. For many
centuries the people would read on its portals, windows, capitals, and
walls the sculptured or painted history and legends of the faith — the
story of the Creation, the Fall of Man and the Last Judgment, the lives
of the prophets and patriarchs, the suffer- ings and miracles of the
saints, the moral allegories of the animal world, the dogmas of the
theologians, even the abstractions of the philosophers; all would be
there, in a vast stone encyclopedia of Christianity. When he died, the
good Christian would want to be buried near those walls, where demons
would be loath to roam. Generation after generation would come to pray
in the cathedral; generation after generation would file out from the
church into the tombs. The gray cathedral would look upon their coming
and their passing with the silent calm of stone, until, in the greatest
death of all, the creed itself would die, and those sacred walls would
be surrendered to om- nivorous time, or be ravished to raise new temples
to new gods.</p>

<li>CONTINENTAL ROMANESQUE: 1066-1200</li>
</ol>
<p>We should misjudge the variety of Western architecture in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries if we allowed the foregoing sketch of cathedral
structure to stand as valid for all Latin Christendom. In Venice the
Byzan- tine influence continued; St. Mark’s added ever new dec orations,
pinnacles, and spoils, but always in the manner of Constantinople
crossed with that of Baghdad. Probably through Venice, perhaps through
Genoa or Marseille, the Byzantine style of domes placed with pendentives
upon a Greco-cruciform base entered France and appeared in the churches
of St. Ltienne and St. Front at Perigueux, and in the cathedrals of
Cahors and Angouleme. In 1 172, when Venice decided to restore and
enlarge the Palace of the Doges, she took a medley of styles — Roman,
Lombard, Byzantine, Arabic — and united them in a masterpiece that
Villehardouin in 1202 thought moult riche et biaux , and which still
remains the chief glory of the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>No definition of an architectural style has ever escaped exceptions;
the works of man, like those of nature, resent generalizations, and
flaunt their individuality in the face of every rule. Let us accept the
round arch, thick walls and piers, narrow windows, attached buttresses
or none, and predomi- nantly horizontal lines, as characterizing
Romanesque; and let us keep an open mind for deviations.</p>
<p>Almost a century after the foundation of its duomo , Pisa
commissioned Diotisalvi to erect a baptistery across a square from the
cathedral (1152). He adopted a circular plan, faced the structure with
marble, disfigured it with blank arcades, encompassed it with
colonnades, and crowned it with a dome that might have been perfect but
for its conical cupola. Behind the cathedral Bonanno of Pisa and William
of Innsbruck raised the Leaning Tower as a campanile ( 1 174) . It
repeated the style of the cathedral fa§ade — a series of superimposed
Romanesque arcades, with the eighth story housing the bells. The Tower
sank on the south side after three stages had been built upon a
foundation only ten feet deep, and the architects tried to offset this
by inclining the later stories toward the north. In a height of 179 feet
the Tower now deviates 16 1 / 2 feet from the perpendicular — an
increase of one foot between 1828 and 1910.</p>
<p>Italian monks migrating into France, Germany, and England brought Ro-
manesque fashions in their train. Perhaps because of them most French
mon- asteries were Romanesque, so that in France Romanesque has the
second name of the monastic style. The Benedictines of Cluny built a
magnificent abbey there (1089-1131), with four side aisles, seven
towers, and such an array of zoological sculpture as roused
St. Bernard’s ire.</p>
<p>In the cloisters, under the eyes of the monks who read, what do</p>
<p>these ridiculous monsters seek to do? What do these unclean

<p>mean, these dragons, centaurs, tigers, and lions . . . these soldiers
fight- ing, these hunting scenes? . . . What business here have these
creatures who are half beast and half man? … We can see here several
bodies under one head, and several heads on one body. Here we observe a
quadruped with the head of a serpent, there a fish with the head of a
quadruped; here an animal is a horse in front and a goat behind. 4</p>
<p>The abbey of Cluny was destroyed in the Jacqueries of the Revolution,
but its architectural influence spread to its 2000 affiliated
monasteries. Southern France is still rich in Romanesque churches; the
Roman tradition was strong there in art as i n law, and long resisted
the “barbaric” Gothic that came down from the North. Marble was rare in
France, and the cathedrals atoned for lack of external brilliance by a
profusion of sculpture. Startling, in the churches of southern France,
is the expressionism of the statuary — the resolve to convey a feeling
instead of copying a scene; so the figure of St. Peter on a portal of
the abbey of Moissac (1150), with its tortured face and arachnid legs,
must have aimed not so much to accentuate structural lines as to im-
press and terrify the imagination. That the sculptors deliberately
distorted such figures appears from the minute realism of the foliage in
the Moissac capitals. The best of these French Romanesque facades is the
west portal of St. Trophim e’s at Arles (1152), crowded with animals and
saints.</p>
<p>Spain raised a lordly Romanesque shrine in the church of Santiago de
Compostela (1078-1211), whose Portico de la Gloria contains the finest
Romanesque sculpture in Europe. Coimbra, soon to be the university city
of Portugal, built a handsome Romanesque cathedral in the twelfth
century. But it was in its more northern migrations that Romanesque
reached its apogee. The lie de France rejected it, but Normandy welcomed
it; its rough power accorded well with a people recently Viking and
still buccaneers. As early as 1048 the Benedictine monks of Jumieges,
near Rouen, built an abbey reputedly larger than any edifice that had
been raised in Western Europe since Constantine; the Middle Ages too
were proud of size. It was half de- stroyed by the fanatics of the
Revolution, but its surviving facade and tow- ers preserve a bold and
virile design. There, indeed, was formed the Norman style of Romanesque,
relying for its effect on mass and structural form rather than on
ornament.</p>
<p>In 1066 William the Conqueror, to expiate the sin of marrying Matilda
of Flanders, provided funds for a church of St. Etienne at Caen, known
as the . Abbaye aux Hommes; and Matilda, perhaps with like motives,
financed there the church of La Trinite, known as the Abbaye aux Dames.
About 1 1 35, in a restoration of the Abbaye aux Hommes, each bay of the
nave was divided with an extra column on each side, bound with a
transverse arch; in this way the usual “quadripartite” became a
“sexpartite” vault, a form that proved popular throughout the twelfth
century.</p>
<p>From France the Romanesque style passed into Flanders, raising a
hand-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>some cathedral at Tournai (1066); and from Flanders, France, and
Italy it entered Germany. Mainz had begun its cathedral in 1009, Trier
in 1016, Speyer in 1030; these were rebuilt before 1300, still in the
rounded style. Cologne built in this period the church of St. Maria im
Kapitol, famous for its interior, and the church of St. Maria, famous
for its towers; both build- ings were destroyed in the Second World War.
The cathedral of Worms, dedicated in 1 1 7 1 and restored in the
nineteenth century, is still a monument of Rhenish Romanesque. These
churches had an apse at each end, and cared little for sculptured
facades; they adorned their exterior with colonnades, and buttressed the
towers with slender turrets of very pleasing form. The non-German critic
praises these Rhenish shrines with patriotic moderation, but they have a
charming gemutlich beauty quite in harmony with the in- viting
loveliness of the Rhine.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE NORMAN STYLE IN ENGLAND: 1066-1200</li>
</ol>
<p>When Edward the Confessor came to the throne in 1042 he brought with
him many friends and ideas from the Normandy in which he had spent his
youth. Westminster Abbey began in his reign as a Norman church with
round arches and heavy walls; that structure was buried under the Gothic
abbey of 1245, but it inaugurated an architectural revolution. The rapid
re- placement of Saxon or Danish by Norman bishops ensured the triumph
of the Norman style in England. The Conqueror and his successors
lavished upon the bishops much of the wealth confiscated from Englishmen
who had not appreciated conquest; the churches became instruments of
mental paci- fication; soon the Norman English bishops matched the
Norman English nobles in wealth; and cathedrals and castles multiplied
as allies in the con- quered land. “Nearly all tried to rival one
another in sumptuous buildings in the Norman style,” wrote William of
Malmesbury; “for the nobles felt that day lost which they had not
celebrated with some deed of mag- nificence.” 5 Never had England seen
such a frenzy of building.</p>
<p>Norman English architecture was a variation of the Romanesque theme.
It followed French exemplars in supporting the roof by round arches on
fat piers, and by heavy walls — though its ceilings were usually of
wood; when the vault was of stone the walls were from eight to ten feet
thick. It was largely monastic, and rose in out-of-the-way places rather
than in cities. It used very little external statuary, fearing the
effect of a damp climate, and even the capitals of the columns were
simply or poorly carved; in sculpture England never caught up with the
Continent. But not many towers could match the mighty structures that
dominated the Norman castles, or guarded the fagade — or covered the
transept crossing — of the Norman church.</p>

<p>esque. Most cathedrals underwent a Gothic lifting of arch and vault
in the thirteenth century, and only the basic Norman form remains. In
1067 fire destroyed the old cathedral of Canterbury; Lanfranc rebuilt it
(1070-7) along the lines of his former Abbaye aux Hommes at Caen;
nothing survives of Lanfranc’s cathedral except a few patches of masonry
where Becket fell. In 1096-1110 the priors Emulf and Conrad built a new
choir and crypt; they kept the round arch, but channeled the strains to
points supported by external buttresses. The transition to Gothic had
begun.</p>
<p>York Minster,* built in 107 5 on a Norman plan, disappeared in 1291
under a Gothic edifice. Lincoln Cathedral, originally Norman (1075), was
re- built in Gothic after the earthquake of 1185; but the two great
towers and sumptuously carved portals of the west fa£ade survive from
the Norman church, and reveal the skill and power of the older style. At
Winchester the transepts and crypt remain of the Norman cathedral of 108
1-1 103. Bishop Walkelin built it to receive the flow of pilgrims to the
tomb of St. Swithin.t Walkelin appealed to his cousin the Conqueror for
timber to roof the enor- mous nave; William agreed to let him take from
Hempage Forest as much wood as he could cut in three days; Walkelin’s

<p>Some echo of the scope of Norman building comes down to us when we
note that St. Alban’s Abbey was begun in 1075, Ely Cathedral in 1081,
Rochester i n 1083, Worcester in 1084, Old St. Paul’s in 1087,
Gloucester in 1089, Durham in 1093, Norwich in 1096, Chichester in 1100,
Tewkes- bury in 1 103, Exeter in 1 1 12, Peterborough in 1116, Romsey
Abbey in 1120, Fountains Abbey in 1140, St. David’s, in Wal es, in 1176.
These are not names, they are masterpieces; shame bows us at leaving
them after a few hours, or dismissing them in a line. All but one were
later rebuilt or re- clothed in Gothic. Durham is still predominantly
Norman, and remains the most impressive Romanesque structure in
Europe.</p>
<p>Durham is a little mining town of some 20,000 souls. At a turn of the
river Wear a rocky promontory rises; on that strategic elevation stands
the gi- gantic mass of the cathedral, “half church of God, half cas tle
against the Scots.” 0 Monks from the island of Lindisfarne, fleeing from
Danish raiders, built a stone church there in 995. In 1093 its second
Norman bishop, Wil- liam of St. Carilef, demolished this building, and

<p>mysterious wealth raised the present edifice. The work continued till
1195, so that the cathedral represents the aspiration and labor of a
hundred years. The lofty nave is Norman, with a double arcade of round
arches resting on uncarved capitals and stout piers. The vault of Durham
introduced to England two vital innovations: the groins were ribbed,
helping to localize pressures; and the transverse arches were pointed,
while the diagonals were round. If the transverse arches had been round,
their crowns would not have reached the same height as the diagonals,
which are longer, and the apex of the vault would have been a
disturbingly uneven line. By lifting the crowns of the transverse arches
to a point, they could be made to reach the desired height. This
structural consideration, and no esthetic aim, apparently fathered the
most prominent feature of the Gothic style.</p>
<p>In 1175 Bishop Pudsey added at the west end of Durham Cathedral an
attractive porch or narthex, which for some unknown reason received the
name of galilee. Here — where lies the tomb of the Venerable Bede — the
arches are round, but the slender columns approach the Gothic form.
Early in the thirteenth century the vault of the choir collapsed; in
rebuilding it the architects supported the nave arcade with flying
buttresses hidden in the triforium. In 1 240-70 a Chapel of the Nine
Altars was added to hold the re- mains of St. Cuthbert; and in that
shrine the arches were pointed, and the transition to Gothic was
complete.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE EVOLUTION OF GOTHIC</li>
</ol>
<p>Gothic architecture might be defined as a localization and balancing
of structural strains, emphasizing vertical lines, ribbed vaults, and
pointed forms. It evolved through the solution of mechanical problems
set by ecclesiastical needs and artistic aspiration. Fear of fire led to
vaults of stone or brick; heavier ceilings necessitated thick walls and
clumsy piers; the ubiquity of downward pressure limited window space,
the thick walls shadowed the narrow windows, and the interior was left
too dark for northern climes. The invention of the ribbed vault lessened
the ceiling weight, allowing slenderer columns and localized strains;
the concentration and balancing of pressures gave the building stability
without heaviness; the localization of support through buttresses
allowed longer windows in thinner walls; the windows offered inviting
scope for the already existing art of stained glass; and the stone
frames surmounting compound windows aroused the new art of pierced
design or tracery. The arches of the vault became pointed to allow
arches of uneven length to reach their crowns at an even height; and
other arches, and window forms, became pointed to harmonize with the
arches of the vault. Better ways of bearing pressure permitted higher
naves; the towers and spires and pointed arches emphasized verticality
of line, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 873</p>
<p>produced the soaring flight and buoyant grace of the Gothic style.
All these together made the Gothic cathedral the supreme achievement and
expression of the soul of man.</p>
<p>But it is presumptuous to concentrate a century of architectural
evolution into a paragraph. Some steps in the development invite calmer
scrutiny. The problem of reconciling light grace with stable strength
was better solved by Gothic than by any architecture before our time;
and we do not know how long our own bold challenges to gravity will
escape the leveling jeal- ousy of the earth. Neither did the Gothic
architect always succeed; Chartres is still without a crack, but the
choir of Beauvais Cathedral crumbled twelve years after it was built.
The essential feature of the Gothic style was the functional rib: the
transverse and diagonal arch ribs rising from each bay of the nave
united to form a light and graceful web upon which a thin vault of
masonry could rest. Each bay of the nave became a structural unit, bear-
ing the weight and thrusts brought down by the arches rising from its
piers, and supported by counter pressures from the corresponding bays of
the aisles, and by outer buttresses applied to the walls at the inward
springing of each transverse arch.</p>
<p>The buttress was an old device. Many pre-Gothic churches had pillars
of masonry externally added at points of special strain. A flying
buttress, however, carries a thrust or strain over open space to a base
support and to the ground. Some Norman cathedrals used half arches in
the triforium to prop up the arches of the nave; but such internal
buttresses reached the nave wall at too low a point, and gave no
strength to the clerestory where the explosive pressure of the vault was
most intense. To apply support at this high point it was necessary to
take the buttress out of its hiding place, let it rise from the solid
ground and throw it through open space over the aisle roof to directly
sustain the clerestory wall. The earliest known use of such an external
flying buttress was in the cathedral of Noyon about 1 150. 7 By the end
of that century it had become a favorite device. It had serious faults:
sometimes it gave the impression of a structural skeleton, a scaffolding
negligently unremoved, or the makeshift afterthought of a designer whose
building sagged; “the cathedral had crutches,” said Michelet. The Renais
- sance would reject the flying buttress as an unsightly obstruction,
and would support by other means such burdens as St. Peter’s dome. The
Gothic archi - tect thought differently; he liked to expose the lines
and mechanisms of his art; he developed a fondness for buttresses, and
perhaps multiplied them beyond need; he compounded them, so that they
would give support at two or more points, or to one another; he
beautified their stabilizing piers with pinnacles; and sometimes, as at
Reims, he proved that at least one angel could stand on the point of a
pinnacle.</p>
<p>The balancing of strains was far more vital to Gothic than the ogive
or pointed arch, but this became the outward and visible sign of an
inward</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>874</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>grace. The pointed arch was a very old form. At Diarbekr in Turkey it
appears on a Roman colonnade of uncertain date. The earliest dated exam-
ple is at Qasr-ibn-Wardan in Syria in 561. 8 The form is found in the
Dome of the Rock and the Mosque of el-Aqsa at Jerusalem in the seventh
century; on a Nilometer in Egypt in 861; in the Mosque of Ibn Tulun at
Cairo in 879; it was in frequent use among Persians, Arabs, Copts, and
Moors before its first appearance in Western Europe in the second half
of the eleventh century. 9 It may have come to Southern France from
Moslem Spain or through pilgrims returning from the East; or it may have
arisen spontane- ously in the West to meet mechanical problems in
architectural design. It should be noted, however, that the problem of
bringing arches of uneven length to an even crown could be solved
without the ogive by “stilting” the shorter arches, i.e., raising their
point of inward springing from pier or wall. This, too, had an esthetic
effect, as emphasizing vertical lines; and the device was widely
adopted, seldom as a substitute for the pointed arch, often as a helpful
accompaniment. The ogive solved a further problem: since the aisles were
narrower than the nave, an aisle bay had more length than width, and the
crowns of its transverse arches would fall far short of those of its
diagonals, unless the transverse arches were either pointed, or stilted
so high as to prevent their harmonious inward movement with the
diagonals. The ogive offered a similar solution for the difficult task
of vaulting with arches of even crown the ambulatory of the apse, where
the outer wall was longer than the inner, and each bay formed a
trapezoid whose vault could not be forgivably designed without the
pointed arch. That this was not at first chosen for its grace appears
from the large number of buildings in which it was used to meet these
problems, while tbe round arch continued to be used in windows and
portals. Gradually the vertical lift of the ogive, and perhaps a desire
for harmonized form, gave the pointed arch the victory. The ninety years
of struggle between the round and the pointed arch — from the appear-
ance of the ogive in the Romanesque cathedral of Durham (1104) to the
final building of Chartres (1 194) — constitute, in French Gothic, the
period of the transition style.</p>
<p>The application of the pointed arch to windows created new problems,
new solutions, and new charms. The channeling of strains through ribs
from vault to piers, and from piers to specific points supported by
buttresses, ended the need for thick walls. The space between each point
of support and the next bore relatively little pressure; the wall there
could be thinned, could even be removed. So large an opening could not
be safely fitted with a single pane of glass. The space was therefore
divided into two or more pointed windows (lancets), surmounted by an
arch of stone; in effect the outer wall, like that of the nave, became a
series of arches, an arcade. The four- pointed “shield” of masonry left
betwee n the upper ends of the paired and pointed windows and the top of
the enclosing stone arch made an ugly</p>
<p>THE GOTHIC FLOWERING</p>

<p>875</p>
<p>blank, and cried out for decoration. About 1170 the architects of
France responded with plate tracery; i.e., they pierced this shield in
such a way as to leave stone bars or mullions in ornamental designs —
circular, cusped, or lobed; and they filled the interstices, as well as
the windows, with stained glass. In the thirteenth century the sculptors
cut away more and more of the stone, and inserted into the opening
little bars of stone carved into cusps or other forms. This bar tracery
took on ever more complex paterns, whose predominating lines gave names
to styles and periods of Gothic architecture: lancet, geometrical,
curvilinear, perpendicular, and flamboyant. Similar processes applied to
wall surfaces over the portals produced the great “rose windows,” whose
radiating tracery generated the term rayonncmt for the style that began
at Notre Dame in 1230 and reached perfection in Reims and Sainte
Chapelle. In the Gothic cathedral only the soaring articulation of the
vault transcends the beauty of the “rose.”</p>
<p>Stone tracery, in the large sense of any piercing of stone in a
decorative design, passed from the walls to other parts of the Gothic
cathedral — the buttress pinnacles, the gables above the portals, the
soffits and spandrels of arches, the triforium arcade, the sanctuary
screen, the pulpit and reredos; for the Gothic sculptor, in the joy of
his art, could scarcely touch a surface without adorning it. He crowded
fagades and cornices and towers with apostles, devils, and saints, with
the saved and the damned; he cut his fancy into capitals, corbels,
moldings, lintels, frets, and jambs; he laughed in stone with the
whimsical or terrifying animals that he invented as gargoyles (“little
throats”) to carry staining rain away from the walls or channel it into
the ground through buttresses. Never elsewhere have wealth and skill,
piety and lusty humor combined to provide such a feast of ornament as
revels in the Gothic cathedral. Undeniably the decoration was sometimes
too profuse, the tracery was carried to a fragile excess, the statues
and capitals must have been too gaudy with the paint that time has
cleansed away. But these are the signs of a vital exuberance, to which
almost any fault can be forgiven. Wan- dering in these jungles and
gardens of stone, it dawns upon us that Gothic art, despite its
heaven-pointing lines and spires, was an art that loved the earth. Amid
these saints proclaiming the vanity of vanities and the terror of the
Judgment soon to come, we perceive the unseen but omnipresent medieval
artisan, proud of his skill, joyful in his strength, laughing at theol-
ogies and philosophies, and drinking with relish, and to the last drop,
the bubbling, brimming, lethal cup of life.</p>

<p>fertilizing flow: Roman basilicas, arches, vaults, and clerestories;
Byzantine themes of ornament; Armenian, Syrian, Persian, Egyptian,
Arabic ogives, groined vaults, and clustered piers; Moorish motifs and
arabesques; Lombard ribbed vaults and fa£ade towers; the Germanic flair
for the humorous and grotesque. . . . But why did these streams of
influence converge in France? Italy, as in wealth and heritage the
favored country of Western Europe, might have led the Gothic flowering,
but she was the prisoner of her classic inheritance. Italy excepted,
France was in the twelfth century the richest, and most advanced, nation
of the West. She above all others had manned and financed the Crusades,
and profited from their cultural stimulus; she led Europe in education,
literature, and philosophy; and her craftsmen were conceded to be the
best this side of Byzantium. By the time of Philip Augus- tus
(1180-1223) the royal power had triumphed over feudal disunity, and the
affluence, power, and intellectual life of France were congregating in
the king’s own domain— that lie de France loosely definable as the
region of the middle Seine. Along the Seine, Oise, Marne, and Aisne a
fruitful com- merce moved, leaving behind it a wealth that turned to
stone in cathedrals at Paris, St. Denis, Senlis, Mantes, Noyon,
Sdissons, Laon, Amiens, and Reims. The manure of money had prepared the
soil for the growth of art.</p>
<p>The first masterpiece of the transition style was the magnificent
abbey church of St. Denis, in the Paris suburb of that name. It was the
work of one of the most complete and successful personalities in French
history. Suger ( 1 08 1 ? — 1 1 5 1 ), Benedictine abbot and regent of
France, was a man of refined tastes, who, while living simply, thought
it no sin to love beautiful things and to gather them for the adornment
of his church. “If the ancient law,” he replied to St. Bernard’s
criticisms, “ordained that cups of gold should be used for libations,
and to receive the blood of rams . . . how much rather should we devote
gold, precious stones, and the rarest of materials to vessels designed
to hold the blood of Our Lord?” 10 So he tells us proudly of the beauty
and cost of the gold and silver, the jewels and enamels, the mosaics and
stained windows, the rich vestments and vessels, which he gathered or
had made for his church. In 1133 he brought together artists and
artisans “from all lands” to raise and adorn a new home for France’s
patron St. Denis, and to house the tombs of the kings of France; he
persuaded King Louis VII and the court to contribute the necessary
funds; “following our example,” he says, “they took the rings from their
fingers” to pay for his costly designs. 11 We picture him rising early
to superintend the construc- tion, from the felling of the trees that he
chose for timbers to the installation of the stained glass whose
subjects he had selected and whose inscriptions he had composed. When he
dedicated his edifice in 1144 twenty bishops of- ficiated; the King, two
queens, and hundreds of knights attended; and Suger might well have felt
that he had won a crown more glorious than any king’s.</p>
<p>Of his church only parts remain in the present edifice: the west
front, two</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 877</p>
<p>bays of the nave, the chapels of the ambulatory, and the crypt; most
of the interior is a reconstruction by Pierre de Montereau between 1231
and 1281. The crypt is Romanesque; the west fagade mingles round and
pointed arches; its sculptures, mostly from Suger’s time, include a
hundred figures, many well individualized, and all centering about one
of the best concep- tions of Christ the Judge in the whole sweep of
medieval art.</p>
<p>Twe lve years after Suger’s death Bishop Maurice de Sully paid him
the compliment of bettering his instruction, and Notre Dame de Paris
rose on an island in the Seine. Its chronology suggests the immensity of
the task: the choir and transepts were built in 1 163-82; the nave in
1182-96, the western- most bays and the towers in 1 2 1 8-2 3 ; the
cathedral was finished in 1235. In the original design the triforium was
to be Romanesque, but in the comple- tion the whole structure adopted
the Gothic style. The west front is un- usually horizontal for a Gothic
cathedral, but that is because the spires that were meant to top the
towers were never built; perhaps for that reason there is a firm and
simple dignity in this facade that has led able students to rank it as
“the noblest architectural conception of man.” 12 The rose windows of
Our Lady of Paris are masterpieces of bar tracery and coloring; but they
were not meant to be described by words. The sculptures, though injured
by time and revolution, represent the finest work in that art between
the age of Constantine and the building of Reims Cathedral. In the
tympanum over the main portal the Last Judgment is carved with greater
calm than in most later renderings of that ubiquitous theme; the Christ
is a figure of quiet majesty; and the angel at His right is one of the
triumphs of Gothic sculp- ture. Better still is La Vierge du trumeau —
the Virgin of the Pillar — on the north portal: here is a new delicacy
of treatment, finish of surface, natural- ness of drapery; a new ease
and grace of stance, with the weight on one foot and the body thereby
freed from stiff verticality; in this lovely figure Gothic sculpture
almost declared its independence from architecture, and produced a
masterpiece quite capable of being taken from its context and standing
triumphantly alone. In Notre Dame at Paris the transition was ended, and
Gothic came of age.</p>
<p>The story of Chartres illuminates the medieval scene and character.
It was a small town fifty-five miles southwest of Paris, just outside
the royal do- main, a market for the plain of Beauce, the “granary of
France.” But the Virgin was said to have visited the place in person;
the pious lame or blind or sick or bereaved made it a goal of
pilgrimage; some were healed or com- forted at her shrine; Chartres
became a Lourdes. Furthermore, its Bishop Fulbert, a man mingled of
goodness, intellect, and faith, made it in the eleventh century a shrine
of higher education, alma mater to some of the most brilliant figures in
early Scholastic philosophy. When Fulbert’s ninth - century cathedral
burned down in 1020 he set himself at once to rebuild it, and lived long
enough to see it finished. This, in turn, was destroyed by fire</p>
<p>878 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>in 1134. Bishop Theodoric made the construction of a new cathedral a
veri- table crusade; he aroused such devotion to the task, financial and
physical, that in 1 144, according to the eye-witness account of Abbot
Haimon of Normandy,</p>
<p>kings, princes, mighty men of the world, puffed up with honors
and</p>
<p>riches, men and women of noble birth, bound bridles upon their</p>
<p>proud and swollen necks, and submitted themselves to wagons which,
after the fashion of brute beasts, they dragged with loads of wine,</p>
<p>corn, oil, lime, stones, beams, and other things necessary to sustain
life</p>
<p>or build churches Moreover, as they draw the wagons we may see</p>
<p>this miracle, that although sometimes a thousand men and women . . .
are bound in the traces . . . yet they go forward in such silence that
no</p>
<p>voice, no murmur, is heard When they pause on the way no words</p>
<p>are heard but confessions of guilt, with supplication and pure
prayer.</p>
<p>. . . The priests preach peace, hatred is soothed, discord is driven
away, debts are forgiven, unity is restored. 13</p>
<p>This cathedral of Bishop Theodoric had hardly been completed ( 1 1
80) when, in 1 194, fire gutted the nave, brought vault and walls to the
ground, and left, as scarred survivors, only the subterranean crypt and
the west fa- cade with its two towers and spires. We are told that every
house in the town was destroyed in that awful conflagration, whose
traces are visible on the cathedral today. The discouraged people for a
time lost faith in the Virgin, and wished to abandon the town. But the
indomitable papal legate Melior told them that the calamity had been
sent by God to punish their sins; he commanded them to rebuild their
church and their homes; the clergy of the diocese contributed nearly all
their income for three years; new miracles were reported of the Virgin
of Chartres; faith was rekindled; multitudes came again, as in 1 144, to
help the paid workers pull the carts and set the stones; funds were
contributed by every cathedral in Europe; 14 and by 1 224 toil and hope
completed the cathedral that makes Chartres again a goal of
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The unknown architect had planned to top with towers not merely the
flanks of the west front but also the transept portals and the apse.
Only the two fagade towers were built. Le Clocher vieux — the Old
Bell-Tower ( 1 145-70) — rose with its spire to 351 feet at the south
end of the fagade; it is simple and unadorned, and wins the preference
of professional archi- tects. 15 Its northern mate — Le Clocher neuf —
twice lost its wooden spire by fire; the spire was rebuilt in stone ( 1
506-12 ) by Jean le Texier in flamboyant Gothic style of crowded and
delicate ornament; Fergusson thought it “the most beautifully designed
spire on the continent of Europe”; 16 but it is ge n- erally agreed that
so ornate a spire mars the unity of an austere fagade. 17</p>

<p>dren, saints, devils, angels, and the Persons of the Trinity. There
are 2000 statues in the portals alone; 38 additional statues stand
against columns in the interior; visitors who climb the 312 steps to the
roof are astonished to see carefully carved life-size figures where none
but the vigorous curious can ever notice them. Over the central portal
is a splendid Christ, not, as in later fagades, sternly judging the
dead, but seated in calm majesty amid a happy throng, His hand held out
as if to bless the entering worshipers. Attached to the recessed
“orders” of the portal arch are nineteen prophets , kings, and queens;
they are slender and stiff as befits their station as literally pillars
of the church; many are crude and unfinished, perhaps injured or worn;
but some of the faces have the philosophic depth, the gentle repose, or
the maiden grace, that were to be perfected at Reims.</p>
<p>The transept fa-jades and porches are the fairest in Europe. Each has
three portals, flanked and separated by beautifully carved columns and
jambs, and almost covered with statues every one of which is so
individualized that sev- eral have received names from the folk of
Chartres. The south porch centers its 783 figures around Christ
enthroned on His judgment seat. Here Notre Dame de Chartres is
subordinated to her Son; but in compensation she is endowed, as in
Albertus Magnus, with all the sciences and philosophy, and in her
service, on this portal, appear the Seven Liberal Arts — Pythagoras as
Music, Aristotle as Dialectic, Cicero as Rhetoric, Euclid as Geometry,

St. Louis, in the words of his charter of 1259, caused the north porch
to be com- pleted “by reason of his particular devotion to the church of
Our Lady of Chartres, and for the saving of his soul and the souls of
his forefather s.” 19 In 1793 the French Revolutionary Assembly defeated
by a narrow margin a motion to destroy the statues of Chartres Cathedral
in the name of philoso- phy and the Republic; “philosophy” compromised
by chopping off some of the hands. 20 This north porch belongs to the
Virgin, and tells her story with reverent affection. The statues here
stand out in the round, as fully matured sculpture; the drapery is as
graceful and natural as in any Greek carving; the figure of Modesty is
French girlhood at its best, where modesty gives to beauty a double
power; there is nothing finer in all the history of sculpture. “These
statues,” said Henry Adams, “are the Aeginetan marbles of French art.”

<p>As one enters the cathedral, four impressions mingle: the simple
lines of the nave and vault, hardly comparable in size or beauty with
the nave of Amiens or Winchester; the ornate choir screen, begun in 1514
by the flam- boyant Jean le Texier; the peaceful figure of Christ on a
pillar of the south transept, and, suffusing all with soft color, the
unequaled stained glass. Here, in 1 74 windows, are 3884 figures from
legend and history, ranging from cob- blers to kings. It is medieval
France seen through the richest colors ever de- veloped — dark reds,
soft blues, emerald greens, saffron, yellow, brown,</p>
<p>880 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>white; here above all is the glory of Chartres. We must not look to
these windows for realistic portraiture; the figures are ungainly,
sometimes ab- surd; Adam’s head, in t he medallion of the Expulsion from
Eden, is painfully askew, and the bilateral charms of Eve could hardly
divert the worshiper to concupiscence. It seemed to these artists enough
that the pictures told a story while the colors fused in the viewer’s
visi on, and in their mingling painted the cathedral air. Excellent in
design is the window of the Prodigal Son; famous for color and line the
window of the symbolic Tree of Jesse; but better than all the rest is
Notre Davie de la belle verriere — u Our Lady of the Beautiful Window.”
Tradition holds that this lovely panel was rescued from the fire of 1
194. 22</p>
<p>Standing at the crossing of transept and nave, one may see the major
roses of Chartres. In the main facade the central rose spans forty-four
feet, almost as wide as the nave that it surveys; some have called it
the finest work in glass known to history. 23 Flooding the north
transept is the “Rose of France,” given by Louis IX and Blanche of
Castile, and dedicated to the Virgin; facing it across the church is the
“Rose of Dreux,” in the south transept fagade, given by Blanche’s enemy,
Pierre Mauclerc of Dreux, and opposing Mary’s Son to Blanche’s Mother of
God. Thirty -five lesser roses and twelve still smaller roselets
complete the roster of Ch artres’ circular glass. The modern spirit, too
hurried and nervous to achieve patient and placid perfection, stands in
wonder before works that must be ascribed not to the genius of singular
individuals, but to the spirit and industry of a people, a community, an
epoch, and a faith.</p>
<p>We have taken Chartres as typifying mature or ray onnant Gothic, and
we must not indulge in similar tarrying over Reims, Amiens, and
Beauvais. But who could pass hurriedly by the west front of Reims? If
the original spires still rose from the towers, that fagade would be the
noblest work of man. Astonishing are the unity and harmony of style and
parts in a structure raised by six generations. The cathedral finished
by Hincmar in 841 was burned down in 1 2 1 o; on the first anniversary
of that fire a new cathedral was begun, designed by Robert de Coucy and
Jean d’Orbais to be fit for the crowning of France’s kings. After forty
years of labor, funds ran out; the work was stopped (1251), and the
great church was not completed till 1 42 7 . A fire in 1480 destroyed
the spires; the savings of the cathedral were used up in re- pairing the
main structure, and the spires were not rebuilt. In the First World War
shells smashed several buttresses, and tore huge gaps in roof and vault;
the outer roof was destroyed by fire, and many statues were ruined.
Other figures have been mutilated by fanatics, or by the erosion of
centuries. History is a duel between art and time.</p>
<p>The sculptures of Reims, like its fagade, mark the acme of Gothic
art. Some are archaically crude; those in the central doorway are
unsurpassed; and at various points on the portals, the pinnacles, the
interior, we come</p>
<p>THE GOTHIC FLOWERING</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>88 1</p>
<p>upon figures that have almost the finish of Periclean statuary. Some,
like the Virgin in the pillar of the central portal, are perhaps too
graceful, and sug- gest a weakening of Gothic force; but the Virgin of
the Purification at the left of the same portal, and the Virigin of the
Visitation at the right, are among those achievements, of conception and
execution, before which tongue and pen are stilled. More renowned, but
not so near perfection, are the smiling angels in the Annunciation group
of this facade. How different those joyous faces are from the St. Paul
of the north portal! — itself one of the most powerful portraits ever
carved in stone.</p>
<p>The sculptures of Amiens Cathedral excel those of Reims in elegance
and finish, but fall short of them in dignity of conception and depth of
revelation. Here on the western porch is the famous Beau Dieu, a little
formal and life- less after the living figures of Reims; here also is
St. Firmin, no frightened ascetic but a firm, calm man, who never
doubted right would triumph; and ’here is a Virgin holding her child in
her arms with all the absorbed tenderness of young motherhood. On the
south portal the Vierge doree, the Golden Virgin, smiles as she watches
her child playing with a ball; she is a bit pretti- fied, but too
gracious to deserve Ruskin’s ungallant epithet, the “soubrette of
Picardy.” Pleasant it is to see how the Gothic sculptors, after a
century of serving theology, discovered men and women, and carved the
joy of life on church fagades. The Church, which also had learned to
enjoy the earth, winked at the discovery, but thought it wise to have a
Last Judgment on the main fagade.</p>
<p>Amiens Cathedral was built in 1220-88 by a succession of architects —
Robert de Luzarches, Thomas de Cormont, and his son Regnault. The towers
were not completed till 1402. The interior is the most successful of
Gothic naves; it rises to a vault 140 feet high, and seems rather to be
drawing the church upward than to be bearing a weight. Continuous shafts
from ground to vault bind the three-storied arcades of the nave into a
majestic unity; the vaulting of the apse is a triumph of harmonious
design over baffling irregularities; and the heart stands still at first
sight of the clerestory windows and the roses of transepts and fagade.
But the nave seems too narrow for its height, the walls too frail for
the roof; an element of insecurity enters into the awe aroused by this
buoyant stone.</p>
<p>In Beauvais Cathedral this vaulting ambition of Gothic overleaped
itself and reached its fated fall. The magnificence of Amiens stirred
the citizens of Beauvais to jealousy. In 1227 they began to build, and
vowed to raise the vault of their shrine thirteen feet higher than
Amiens’. They brought the choir to the promised height; but hardly had
they roofed it when it fell. In 1272a recuperating generation built the
choir again as high as before, and in 1284 it fell again. Once more they
built the choir, this time to 157 feet from the ground; then their funds
ran out, and they left the church for two cen- turies without transepts
or nave. In 1 500, when France had at last recovered</p>
<p>882</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>from the Hundred Years’ War, the gigantic transepts were begun; and
in 1552 — to top the spire of St. Peter’s in Rome— a lantern tower was
raised over the transept cross to a height of 500 feet. In 1573 this
tower collapsed, and brought down with it large sections of the
transepts and the choir. The brave Beauvaisois at last compromised: they
repaired the choir to its precarious pitch, but never added a nave.
Beauvais Cathedral is therefore all head and no body; externally two
rich transept facades and an apse engulfed in but- tresses; internally a
cavernous choir aglow with magnificent stained glass. If, ran an old
French saying, one could combine the choir of Beauvais with the nave of
Amiens, the fagade of Reims, and the spires of Chartres, one would have
a perfect Gothic cathedral.</p>
<p>In later ages men would look back to that thirteenth century and
wonder what fountain of wealth and faith had poured out such glory upon
the earth. For no man can know what France accomplished in that century
— besides her universities, her poets, her philosophers, and her
Crusades — unless he stands in person before one after another of the
Gothic audacities that can here be only names: Notre Dame and Chartres
and Reims and Amiens and Beauvais; Bourges ( 1 195 — 1 390) with its
vast nave and four aisles and famed glass and lovely sculptured Angel
with the Scales; Mont St. Michel with its marvel of a monastery (La
Merveille , 1 204-50) set in a fortress towering on an island rock off
the coast of Normandy; Coutances (1208-1386) with its noble spires;
Rouen (1201- 1500) with its ornate Portail des libraires • and Sainte
Chapelle in Paris — a “jewel box” of Gothic glass built (1245 -8) by
Pierre de Montereau as a chapel adjunct to the palace of St. Louis, to
house the relics that the King had purchased from the East. It is good
to remember, in ages of destruction, that men, when they will, can build
as once they built in France.</p>

<li>ENGLISH GOTHIC: II75-I280</li>
</ol>
<p>From Chartres and the He de France the Gothic style swept into the
French provinces, and crossed frontiers into England, Sweden, Germany,
Spain, at last into Italy. French architects and craftsmen accepted
foreign commissions, and everywhere the new art was called opus
Francigenum — work born in France. England welcomed it because she was
in the twelfth century half French; the Channel was but a river between
two sides of a British realm that included half of France; and of that
realm Rouen was the cultural capital. English Gothic derived from
Normandy rather than from the lie de France, and kept in a Gothic frame
the Norman massiveness. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic was
almost simultaneous in England and France; about the same time that the
pointed arch was being used at St. Denis (1140) it was appearing in
Durham and Gloucester cathedrals, at</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 883</p>
<p>Fountains Abbey and Malmesbury. 24 Henry III (1216-72) admired every-
thing French, envied the architectural glory of St. Louis’ reign, and
taxed his people into poverty to rebuild Westminster Abbey, and to pay
the school of artists — builders, sculptors, painters, illuminators,
goldsmiths — whom he gathered near his court to execute his plans.</p>
<p>Of the three periods into which English Gothic falls — Early
English</p>
<p>(1175-1280), Decorated (1280-1380), and Perpendicular (1380-1450) —
we confine ourselves here to the first. The long and pointed form of
Early English windows and arches gave the style another name — Lancet.
Fa?ades and portals were simpler than in France; Lincoln and Rochester
had some sculptures, Wells many more; but these were exceptional, and
could not be compared, in quality or quantity, with the portal statuary
of Chartres, Amiens, or Reims. Towers were massive rather than tall; but
the steeples of Salisbury, Norwich, and Lichfield show what the English
builder could do when he preferred elegance and height to dignity and
mass. Interior eleva- tion likewise failed to lure the architects of
England; sometimes they tried it, as at Westminster and Salisbury; but
more often they allowed the vault to lie oppressively low, as at
Gloucester and Exeter. The great length of English cathedrals
discouraged the effort to attain proportionate height; Winchester is 556
feet long, Ely 517, Canterbury 514, Westminster Abbey 51 1 ; Amiens is
435, Reims 430, even Milan only 475. But Winchester’s in - ternal height
was bu t 78 feet, Canterbury’s 80, Lincoln’s 82, Westminster’s 103,
while Amiens rose to 140 feet.</p>
<p>The east end of the English Gothic church retained the square apse of
the Anglo-Saxon style, ignoring the convenient French development of the
polygonal or semicircular apse. In many cases the east end was expanded
into a Lady Chapel for the special worship of the Virgin; but the
adoration of Mary never reached in England the enthusiasm that marked it
in France. Often in England the chapter house of the cathedral canons,
and the palace of the bishop, were attached to the church and
constituted with it the “ca - thedral close,” usually surrounded by a
wall. In the Gothic monasteries of England and Scotland — as at
Fountains, Dryburgh, Melrose, Tintern — the spread of dormitories,
refectories, abbey, and cloistered walks formed in one enclosure an
impressive artistic whole.</p>
<p>The essential principle of Gothic architecture — the balancing and
channel- ing of pressures to reduce ungainly massiveness of support —
seems never to have won full acceptance in England. The old Romanesque
thickness of wall was only slightly moderated in English Gothic, even
when, as at Salisbury, the design did not have to adapt itself to a
Romanesque base. English archi- tects, like the Italian, were repelled
by the flying buttress; they adopted it here and there, but
halfheartedly; they felt that the supports of a building should be
contained in the structure itself, and not in excrescences. Perhaps</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>884</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>they were right; and though their cathedrals lack the feminine grace
of the French chef- d’oeuvres, they have a firm and masculine power that
reaches</p>
<p>Four years after the murder of Becket at Canterbury, the choir of the
cathedral burned down ( 1 1 74) . The people of the town beat their
heads against the walls in anger and bewilderment that the Almighty had
permitted such disaster to a shrine that had already become a goal of
religious pilgrim- age. 215 The monks entrusted the work of rebuilding
the choir to William of Sens, a French architect who had made a name for
himself with thf cathedral that he had built for his city. William
worked at Canterbury from 1175 to 1 1 78; a fall from a scaffolding
disabled him, and the undertaking was carried on by William the
Englishman, a man “small in body,” says the monk Ger - vase, “but in
workmanship of many kinds acute and honest.” 26 Much of the Romanesque
cathedral of 1096 remained; round arches survived amid the generally
Gothic renovation; but the old wooden ceiling of the choir was replaced
by a ribbed vault of stone, the columns were lengthened to a grace- ful
height, the capitals were exquisitely carved, and the windows were
filled with brilliant stained glass. Gathered in its cathedral close,
and yet towering over its quaint and lovely town, Canterbury Cathedral
is today one of the most inspiring sights of the earth.</p>
<p>Its example, seen by countless prelates and pilgrims, spread the
Gothic style through Britain. In 1177 Peterborough fronted the west
transept of its cathedral with a splendid Gothic portico. In 1189 Bishop
Hugh de Lacy built the handsome retrochoir of Winchester Cathedral. In
1186 an earth- quake rent Lincoln Cathedral from top to base; six years
later Bishop Hugh began its reconstruction on a Gothic design by
Geoffrey de Noyers; the noble Grosseteste finished it about 1 240. It
stands on a hill overlooking a typically beautiful English countryside.
Seldom has sublimity of mass been so well reconciled with delicacy of
detail. The three great towers, the broad faqade with its sculptured
portal and complex arcades, the lordly nave, seemingly light despite its
mass and span, the graceful shafts and carving of the piers, the rose
windows, the palmlike vaulting of the chapter house, the magnificent
arches of the cloisters — these would have made Lincoln Cathe- dral a
credit to mankind even had there been no “Angel Choir.” In 1239 an old
Norman tower fell and crushed Bishop Hugh’s choir; a new choir rose in
1256-80 in the nascent Decorated style, ornate but exquisite; legend as-
cribed its name to the angels who were said to have built it, since no
human hands could have compassed such perfection; but probably the name
came from the smiling angel musicians sculptured on the spandrels of the
tri- forium. On the south portal of this choir English sculptors almost
rivaled the carvings of Reims and Amiens. Four statues there, beheaded
and otherwise mutilated by the Puritans, can bear such comparison; one
representing the Synagogue and another representing the Church are the
finest English</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 885</p>
<p>statuary of the thirteenth century. A great scientist, Sir William
Osier, thought this Angel Choir the fairest of all products of human
art. 27</p>
<p>In 1220 Bishop Poore engaged Elias de Derham to design and build
Salis- bury Cathedral. It rose to completion in the unusually short
space of twenty- five years; it is Early English throughout, and breaks
the rule that English cathedrals mingle several styles. The unity of
design, the harmony of mass and line, the simple majesty of the transept
tower and spire, the grace of the vault in the Lady Chapel, and the
lovely windows of the chapter house redeem the squat heaviness of the
nave piers and the oppressive shallowness of the vault. Ely Cathedral
still has a wooden ceiling, but not unpleasing; there is a warm and
living quality in wood that never comes to architecture in stone. To
Ely’s fine No rman nave the Gothic architects added a pretty west porch,
or galilee (c. 1205); a presbytery with handsome column clus- ters of
Purbeck marble; and, in fourteenth-century Decorated Gothic, a Lady
Chapel, a choir, and, over the transept crossing, a gorgeous lantern
tower — the “Ely Octagon.” Wells Cathedral (i 174 -91) was one of the
earli- est examples of English Gothic; its nave was not too well
designed; but the west front added (1220- 42) by Bishop Jocelyn
“narrowly escaped being the most beautiful in England.” 28 In the niches
of this fa£ade were 340 stat - ues; 106 are missing, victims of
Puritanism, vandalism, and time; those that remain constitute the
largest collection of figure sculpture in Britain. We cannot say as much
for their quality.</p>
<p>The culminating achievement of Early English Gothic was Westminster
Abbey. Henry III, who had made Edward the Confessor his patron saint,
felt that the Norman church built by Edward (1050) was unworthy to house
Edward’s bones; he ordered his artists to replace it with a Gothic edi-
fice in the French style; and for this purpose he raised by taxation
£ys°r 000, which we may diffidently equate at 0,000,000 today. The work
began in 1 245, and continued till Henry’s death in 1 272. The design
followed Reims and Amiens, even to admitting the Continental polygonal
apse. The sculptures of the north porch, portraying the Last Judgment,
were influ- enced by those of Amiens’ west front. In the spandrels of
the transept tri - forium are remarkable reliefs of angels; one angel in
the south transept offers to the centuries a tender, gracious face
rivaling the cherubim of Reims. Over the doorway of the chapter house
are two figures representing the Annunci- ation, and showing the Virgin
in a charming gesture of modest deprecation. Even finer are the early
royal tombs in the Abbey, and, best of all, that of Henry III himself —
an ideally handsome and well-proportioned improve- ment upon the stout
and stunted King. The crimes of a score of rulers are in those splendid
tombs forgotten, and half redeemed by the English genius that lies
buried under the stones of this sovereign sepulcher.</p>

<p>Flanders imported Gothic from France at an early date. St. Gudule’s,
proud on its hill in Brussels, was begun in 1 220; its chief glory is
its stained glass. St. Bavon’s, at Ghent, built a Gothic choir in 1274;
and St. Rombaut’s, at Mechlin, surveyed the countryside from huge towers
never finished but still too ornate. Flanders was more interested in
textiles than in theology; its characteristic architecture was civic;
and its earliest Gothic triumphs were the cloth halls at Ypres, Bruges,
and Ghent. That of Ypres ( 1 200-1 304) was the most majestic: a
450-feet-long facade of three-storied arcades, with col- onnaded corner
pinnacles and stately central tower; it was reduced to ruins in the
First World War. The Cloth Hall of Bruges (1284O still dominates its
square with a superb and world-famous belfry. These fine buildings, and
those of Ghent ( 1 3 2jf ) , suggest the prosperity and just pride of
the Flemish guilds, and constitute some part of the charm of these now
quiet and pleasant towns.</p>
<p>As Gothic spread eastward into Holland and Germany it encountered in-
creasing resistance. In general the grace of the Gothic style did not
accord with the sturdy force of the Teutonic frame and mind; Romanesque
was more congenial, and Germany clung to it till the thirteenth century.
The great cathedral of Bamberg (1185-1237) is transitional: the windows
are small and round-arched, and there are no flying buttresses; but the
vault is in ribbed and pointed form. Here at the outset of German Gothic
we find a remarkable development of sculpture: at first imitating the
French, but soon advancing to a style of splendid naturalism and power;
indeed, the figure of the Synagogue on the Bamberg church is more
satisfying than the similar figure at Reims. 20 The Elizabeth and Mary
in the choir are far from replicas of like subjects in France; Elizabeth
has the face and form of a togaed Roman senator, and Mary is a woman of
physical substance and vigor, such as Ger- many has always loved.</p>
<p>Almost every German cathedral surviving from this period contains
out- standing statuary. The best is in the cathedral of Naumburg ( c .
1250). In the west choir is a series of twelve statues portraying local
dignitaries with a ruthless realism that suggests that the artists were
underpaid; as if in atone- ment, the portrait of Uta, the margrave’s
wife, is a wistful German’s concep - tion of an ideal woman. A frieze on
the screen of the choir shows Judas taking money to betray Christ; the
figures are crowded together in bold composition, but without damage to
their individuality; Judas is represented with some sympathy, and the
Pharisees are powerful personalities. This is the masterpiece of German
sculpture in the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>In 1248 Conrad of Hochstaden, Archbishop of Cologne, laid the founda-
tion stone of the most famous and least German of German cathedrals.
The</p>
<p>THE GOTHIC FLOWERING</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXll)</p>
<p>887</p>
<p>work progressed slowly in the chaos that followed the death of
Frederick II; the cathedral was not consecrated till 1322; much of it
dates from the four- teenth century; the elegant spires, complex with
crockets and open-work tracery, were built in 1880 from
fifteenth-century designs. Modeled on Amiens, Cologne followed French
style and methods closely. The lines of the fa§ade are too straight and
hard, but the tall, slender pillars of the nave, the brilliant windows,
and the fourteen statues on the piers of the choir make an attractive
interior, almost miraculously spared by the Second World War. The
cathedral of Strasbourg is more satisfying. There, as at Cologne,
proximity to France made a French style seem no more foreign than it
would seem in Strasbourg today (1949). The exterior is French grace, the
interior is German force. The cathedral is approached through a
picturesque conges- tion of gabled houses. Statues adorn the fa£ade, but
are outshone by a rose window of great compass and splendor. The single
tower at one corner of the front gives the structure a crippled look.
But the combination of dignity and decoration i s here perfectly
successful; we come to understand Goethe’s description of this fa as
“frozen music,” though we should use a warmer phrase. “Brought up as I
was,” Goethe wrote, “to looking upon Gothic architecture with contempt,
I despised it; but when I went inside I was struck with wonder, and I
felt the attraction of its beauty.” 30 The stained glass here</p>

<p>Medieval Italians called Gothic lo stile Tedesco ; and Renaissance
Italians, equally mistaken about its origin, invented the name Gothic
for it, on the ground that only the transalpine barbarians could have
developed so ex- travagant an art. The decorative exuberance and exalted
audacity of the style offended the classic and long-chastened tastes of
the Italian soul. If Italy</p>
<p>888 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>at last adopted Gothic, it was with a reluctance verging on contempt;
and only after she had transformed it to her own needs and mood could
she pro- duce not only the exotic brilliance of Milan Cathedral, but the
strange Byzantine-Romanesque Gothic of Orvieto and Siena, Assisi and
Florence. Her soil and her ruins alike abounded in marble, with which
she could face her shrines in slabs of many tints; but how could she
carve a marble facade into the complex portals of the freestone North?
She did not need the enor- mous windows by which the chill and cloudy
North invited light and warmth; she preferred the small windows that
made her cathedrals cool sanc- tuaries against the sun; she thought
thick walls, even iron braces, no uglier than stilted buttresses. Not
needing pinnacles or pointed arches as devices of support, she used them
as ornaments, and never quite appropriated the con- structive logic of
the Gothic style.</p>
<p>In the North that style had been, before 1300, almost entirely
ecclesiasti- cal; and the few exceptions were in such commercial cities
as Ypres, Bruges, and Ghent. In northern and Central Italy, even richer
than the Lowlands in manufacturing and trade, civic architecture played
a prominent role in the Gothic development. Town halls, city walls,
gates, and towers, feudal cas- tles and merchant palaces took on Gothic
form or ornament. Perugia began its Palazzo del Municipio in 1 2 8 1 ,
Siena its Palazzo Pubblico in 1 2 89, Bologna its Palazzo Comunale in 1
290, Florence its unique and graceful Palazzo Vecchio in 1298 — all in
Tuscan Gothic style.</p>
<p>At Assisi in 1 2 28 Brother Elias, to accommodate his numerous
Franciscan monks and the swelling crowd of pilgrims to St. Francis’
tomb, ordered the erection of the spacious convent and church of San
Francesco — the first Gothic church in Italy. The commission was given
to a German master builder whom the Italians named Iacopo d’Alemannia;
perhaps it was for this reason that Gothic was known in Italy as “the
German style.” Iacopo built a Lower Church in Romanesque groined-vault
style, and upon this an Upper Church with traceried windows and ribbed
and pointed vault. The churches and the convent make an imposing mass,
not quite as interesting as the remarkable frescoes by Cimabue, Giotto,
and Giotto’s pupils, or the tourists and worshipers who daily flock from
a hundred towns to the shrine of Italy’s favorite and least -heeded
saint.</p>
<p>Siena is still a medieval city: a public square with government
buildings, open market stands, and modest adjoining shops that make no
effort to at- tract the eye. From this center a dozen alleys pick their
shady, hazardous way between dark and ancient tenements hardly ten feet
apart, filled with a kindly and volatile people to whom water is a
luxury rarer and more dan- gerous than wine. On a hill behind the
tenements rises La Metropolitana — the cathedral of the city — in an
unpleasant striation of black and white marble. Begun in 1229, it was
completed in 1348. In 1380, from plans left by Gio- vanni Pisano, a new
and gorgeous fagade was added, all of red, black, or</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 889</p>
<p>white marble, with three Romanesque portals flanked by jambs of
splendid carving and surmounted by gables of crocheted design; a vast
rose window filtered the setting sun; arcades and colonnades running
along the front pre- sented a parade of statuary; pinnacles and towers
of white marble softened the corners; and in the high pediment a vast
mosaic showed the Virgin Mother floating up to paradise. The Italian
architect was interested in a bright and colorful surface; not, like the
French, in the subtle play of light and shade upon recessed portal
orders and deeply sculptured facades. There are no buttresses here; the
choir is topped with a Byzantine dome; the weight is borne by thick
walls and by round arches of gigantic span rising from clustered columns
of marble to a vault of round and pointed ribs. Here is a Tuscan Gothic
still predominantly Romanesque, all the world apart from the heavy
miracles of Amiens and Cologne. Within is the white marble pul- pit of
Niccolo and Giovanni Pisano, a bronze Baptist by Donatello (1457),
frescoes by Pinturicchio, an altar by Baldassar e Peruzzi ( 1 5 3 2 ) ,
richly carved choir stalls by Bartolomeo Neroni (1567); so an Italian
church could grow from century to century through the never-ending
stream of Italian genius.</p>
<p>While Siena’s cathedral and campanile were taking form, a miracle re
- ported from the village of Bolsena had architectural results. A priest
who had doubted the doctrine of transubstantiation was convinced by
seeing blood on the consecrated Host. In commemoration of this marvel,
Pope Urban IV not only instituted the Feast of Corpus Christi ( 1 264),
but ordered the erec- tion of a cathedral at neighboring Orvieto.
Arnolfo di Cambio and Lorenzo Maetani designed it, engaged forty
architects, sculptors, and painters from Siena and Florence, and worked
on it from 1290 to its completion in 1330. The facade followed the style
of Siena’s, but with finer finish of execution and better proportion and
symmetry; it is a vast painting in marble, whose every element is itself
a painstaking masterpiece. Incredibly detailed and yet precise reliefs
on the broad pilasters between the portals tell again the story of
creation, the life of Christ, the Redemption, and the Last Judgment; one
of these reliefs, the Visitation, has already the perfection of
Renaissance sculpture. Delicately carved colonnades divide the three
stages of the lofty fagade, and shelter a population of prophets,
apostles, Fathers, and saints; a rose window dubiously ascribed to
Orcagna (1359) centers the whole com- plex composition; and above it a
dazzling mosaic (now removed) portrayed the Coronation of the Virgin.
The strangely striated interior is a simple basilican arcade under a low
wooden ceiling; the light is poor, and one can hardly do justice to the
frescoes by Fra Angelico, Benozzo Gozzoli, and Luca Signorelli.</p>
<p>But it was in opulent Florence that the fury of building which
swept</p>
<p>through Italy in the thirteenth century worked its greatest marvels.
In 1294 Arnolfo di Cambio began the church of Santa Croce; he retained
the tradi- tional basilican plan without transepts and with flat wooden
ceiling, but he</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>890</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>adopted the pointed arch for the windows, the nave arcade, and the
marble fafade. The beauty of the church consisted less in its
architecture than in the wealth of sculptures and frescoes within,
showing all the skill of a maturing Italian art. In 1 298 Arnolfo
refaced the baptistery with that tasteless alterna- tion of black and
white marble layers which disfigures so many works of the Tuscan style
by crushing the vertical elevation under a plethora of horizon- tal
lines. But the proud spirit of the age — another cockcrow of the Renais-
sance-can be heard in the edict ( 1 294) by which the Signoria
commissioned Arnolfo to build the great cathedral:</p>
<p>Whereas it is sovereign prudence on the part of a people of high</p>
<p>origin to proceed in its affairs in such wise that the wisdom and
mag- nanimity of its proceedings may shine forth in its visible works,
it is</p>
<p>ordered that Arnolfo, master architect of our commune, shall prepare
models or designs for the restoration of 〔the cathedral of〕 Santa
Maria Reparata, with the most exalted and the most prodigal
magnificence, in order that the industry and power of men may never
create or</p>
<p>undertake anything whatsoever more vast and more beautiful; in</p>
<p>accordance with that which our wisest citizens have declared and</p>
<p>counseled in public session and in secret conclave — that no hand be
laid upon the works of the commune without the intention of mak-</p>
<p>ing them correspond to the noble soul which is composed of the souls
of all its citizens united in one will. 32</p>
<p>As doubtless this expansive proclamation was intended to do, it
stimulated public giving. The guilds of the city joined in financing the
enterprise; and when, later on, other guilds proved slack, the wool
guild took over the entire cost, contributing as high as 51,500 gold
lire (,270,000) a year. 33 Accord- ingly, Arnolfo laid out dimensions on
a grandiose scale. The stone vault was to be 150 feet high, equal to
Beauvais’; the nave 260 by 55; and the weight was to be borne by thick
walls, iron braces, and pointed nave arches re- markable for their small
number — four — and their enormous sixty-five-foot span and ninety-foot
height. Arnolfo died in 1301; the work went on, with considerable
alteration of plans, under Giotto, Andrea Pisano, Brunelleschi, and
others; and the ugly pile, renamed Santa Maria de Fiore, was not conse-
crated till 1436. It is a structure immense and bizarre, which spanned
six cen- turies in building, covered 84,000 square feet, and proved
inadequate for Savonarola’s audience.</p>

<li>Spanish gothic: 1091-1300</li>
</ol>
<p>As the monks of France had brought Romanesque architecture to Spain
in the eleventh century, so in the twelfth they carried Gothic over the
Pyre- nees. In the picturesque little town of Avila the cathedral of San
Salvador</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE GOTHIC FLOWERING 89 1</p>
<p>(109 if) inaugurated the transition with round arches, a Gothic
portal, and, in the apse, elegant columns rising to pointed ribs in the
vault. At Salamanca piety preserved the old transitional cathedral of
the twelfth century beside the new one of the sixteenth; the two
together form one of the most imposing architectural ensembles in Spain.
At Tarragona difficulties of finance pro- longed the building of the seo
or episcopal see from 1089 to 1375; the simple solidity of the older
elements forms a fit background for the Gothic and Moorish decoration;
and the cloisters — Romanesque colonnades under a Gothic vault — are
among the most beautiful productions of medieval art.</p>
<p>Tarragona is distinctly Spanish; Burgos, Toledo, and Leon are
progres- sively more French. The marriage of Blanche of Castile to Louis
VIII of France ( 1 200) widened the road of intercourse already opened
by migra- tory monks. It was her nephew, Fernando III of Castile, who
laid the first stone of Burgos Cathedral in 1 2 2 1 ; it was an unknown
French architect who designed the structure; a German of Cologne — Juan
de Colonia — who raised the spires (1442); a Burgundian, Felipe de
Borgona, who rebuilt the great lantern over the transept cross ( 1 5
39-43 ) ; at last his pupil, the Spaniard Juan de Vallejo, completed the
edifice in 1567. The ornate traceried spires, the open towers that
uphold them, and the sculptured arcade give to the west front of Santa
Maria la Mayor a dignity and splendor that one cannot soon forget.
Originally all this stone fa£ade was painted; the colors have long since
worn away; we can only try to imagine the resplendent mass that here
once rivaled the sun.</p>
<p>The same Fernando III provided the funds for the still more
magnificent cathedral of Toledo. Few inland cities have a more scenic
site — nestling in a bend of the Tagus River, and hidden by protective
hills; none would guess from its present poverty that once Visigothic
kings, then Moorish emirs, then the Christian monarchs of Leon and
Castile made it their capital. Begun in 1227, the cathedral rose in slow
installments, and was hardly finished by</p>
<ol start="1493" type="1">
<li>Only one tower was executed on the original plan; it is half Moorish
in the style of the Giralda at Seville, and almost as elegant. The other
tower was capped in the seventeenth century with a dome designed by
Toledo’s most famous citizen, Domingo Teotocopuli — El Greco. The
interior, 395 feet long and 178 feet wide, is a five-aisled maze of tall
piers, ornate chapels, ascetic stone saints, iron grilles, and 750
windows of stained glass. All the en- ergy of the Spanish character, all
the gloom and passion of Spanish piety, all the elegance of Spanish
manners, and something of the Moslem’s flair for ornament find form and
voice in this immense cathedral.</li>

<p>It is a proverb in Spain that “Toledo has the richest of our
cathedrals, Oviedo t he holiest, Salamanca the strongest, Leon the most
beautiful.” 34 Begun by Bishop Manrique in 1 205, the cathedral of Leon
was financed by small contributions rewarded with indulgences, and was
completed in</p>

<p>892 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>windows; and its stained glass ranks high among the masterpieces of
that art. It may be true that the ground plan is taken from Reims, the
west front from Chartres, the south portal from Burgos; the result is a
charming cento of the French cathedrals — with finished towers and
spires.</p>
<p>Many other shrines rose to celebrate the reconquest of Spain for
Christi- anity — at Zamora in 1174, Tudela in 1188, Lerida in 1203,
Palma in 1229, Valencia in 1262, Barcelona in 1298. But, excepting Leon,
we should hardly describe the Spanish cathedrals of this period as
Gothic. They avoided large windows and flying buttresses; they rested
their weight on heavy walls and piers; instead of arch ribs running from
base to ceiling, the piers themselves rose almost to the vault; and
these tall columns, rising like stone giants in the caverns of immense
naves, give to Spanish cathedral interiors a dark grandeur that subdues
the soul with terror, while Northern Gothic lifts it up with light.
Portals and windows, in Spanish Gothic, often kept the Romanesque arch;
amid the Gothic ornament the decoration by diverse layers and pat- terns
of colored brick preserved a Moorish element; and the Byzantine influ-
ence survived in domes and half domes rising with pendentive modulations
from a polygonal base. It was from these varied constituents that Spain
evolved a unique style for some of the finest cathedrals in Europe.</p>
<p>Not the least notable achievements of medieval architecture were the
cas- tles and fortresses of the countryside, and the walls and gates of
the towns. The walls of Avila still stand to prove the medieval sense of
form; and such gates as the Puerto del Sol in Toledo typically married
beauty to use. From memories of the Roman castellum, and perhaps from
observation of Moslem forts, 38 the Crusaders built in the Near East
mighty fortresses like that of Kerak ( 1 1 2 1 ) , superior in both mass
and form to anything of their kind in that warlike age. Hungary, the
bastion of Europe against the Mongols, raised magnificent
castle-fortresses in the thirteenth century. The art flowed west, and
left in Italy such masterpieces of military art as the fortress-tower of
Volterra, and in France the thirteenth-century castles of Coucy and
Pierrefonds, and the famous Chateau Gaillard that Richard Coeur de Lion
constructed (1197) on returning from Palestine. Castles in Spain were no
figments of fancy, but powerful masses of masonry that kept back the
Moors and gave a name to Castile. When Alfonso VI of Castile (107 3-1
108) cap- tured Segovia from the Moslems he built there a
castle-fortress on the plan of the Alcazar of Toledo. In Italy castles
rose as urban citadels for nobles; the towns of Tuscany and Lombardy
still bristle with them; San Gimignano alone had thirteen before the
Second World War. As early as the tenth cen- tury, at Chateaudun, France
began to build the chateaux that in the Ren- aissance period were to
form a lordly feature of her art. The technique of erecting stone
castles passed into England with the Norman favorites of Edward the
Confessor; it was advanced by the offensive and defensive meas-</p>
<p>THE GOTHIC FLOWERING</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>893</p>
<p>ures of William the Conqueror, under whose iron hand the Tower of
Lon- don, Windsor Castle, and Durham Castle took their earliest forms.
From France, again, castle-building migrated to Germany, where it became
a pas- sion with lawless barons, warrior kings, and conquering saints.
The mon- strous Schloss of Konigsberg, built (1257) as a fortress from
which the Teutonic Knights might rule a hostile population, was a proper
victim of the Second World War.</p>
<p>X. CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Gothic architecture was the supreme achievement of the medieval soul.
The men who dared to suspend those vaults on a few stilts of stone
studied and expressed their science with greater thoroughness and effect
than any medieval philosopher in any summa, and the lines and harmonies
of Notre Dame make a greater poem than The Divine Comedy. Comparison of
Gothic with classic architecture cannot be made in gross but demands
specification. No one city in medieval Europe rivaled the architectural
product of either Athens or Rome, and no Gothic shrine has the pure
beauty of the Parthenon; but neither has any classic structure known to
us the complex sublimity of the Reims fa9ade, or the uplifting
inspiration of Amiens’ vault. The restraint</p>
<p>Why did Gothic architecture decline? Partly because every style, like
an emotion, exhausts itself by complete expression, and invites reaction
or change. The development of Gothic into Perpendicular in England,
Flam- boyant in France, left the form no future except exaggeration and
decay. The collapse of the Crusades, the decline of religious belief,
the diversion of funds from Mary to Mammon, from Church to state, broke
the spirit of the Gothic age. The taxation of the clergy, after Louis
IX, depleted the cathe- dral treasuries. The communes and the guilds
that had shared in the glory</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>894</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>and the costs lost their independence, their wealth, and their pride.
The Black Death and the Hundred Years’ War exhausted both France and
England. Not only did new construction diminish in the fourteenth
century, but most of the great cathedrals begun in the twelfth and
thirteenth were left unfin- ished. Finally the rediscovery of classic
civilization by the humanists, and the revival of classical architecture
in Italy, where it had never died, super- seded Gothic with a new
exuberance. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century Renaissance
architecture dominated Western Europe, even through baroque and rococo.
When, in its turn, the classic mood paled away, the Romantic movement of
the early nineteenth century re-created the Middle Ages in idealizing
imagination, and Gothic architecture returned. The strug- gle between
the classic and the Gothic styles still rages in our churches and
schools, our marts and capitals, while a new and indigenous
architecture, bolder even than Gothic, rides the sky.</p>
<p>Medieval man thought that truth had been revealed to him, so that he
was spared from its wild pursuit; the reckless energy that we give to
seeking it was turned in those days to the creation of beauty; and amid
poverty, epi- demics, famines, and wars men found time and spirit to
make beautiful a thousand varieties of objects, from initials to
cathedrals. Breathless before some medieval manuscript, humble before
Notre Dame, feeling the far vision of Winchester’s nave, we forget the
superstition and squalor, the petty wars and monstrous crimes, of the
Age of Faith; we marvel again at the patience, taste, and devotion of
our medieval ancestors; and we thank a million forgotten men for
redeeming the blood of history with the sacrament of art.</p>
