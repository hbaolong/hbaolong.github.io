</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Despite recent high example to the contrary , 1 the word
civilization will be used in this volume to mean social organization,
moral order, and cultural activity; while culture will mean, according
to the context, either the practice of manners and the arts, or the sum-
total of a people’s institutions, customs and arts. It is in the latter
sense that the</p></li>
<li><p>the concept of time. Watching woodpeckers storing acorns in the
trees, and the bees storing honey in hives, man conceived — perhaps
after millen- niums of improvident savagery — the notion of laying up
food for the future. He found ways of preserving meat by smoking it,
salting it, freezing it; better still, he built granaries secure from
rain and damp, vermin and thieves, and gathered food into them for the
leaner months of the year. Slowly it became apparent that agriculture
could provide a better and steadier food supply than hunting. With that
realization man took one of the three steps that led from the beast to
civilization — speech, agriculture, and writing.</p></li>
<li><p>This primitive skill displayed itself proudly in the art of
weaving. Here, too, the animal showed man the way. The web of the
spider, the nest of the bird, the crossing and texture of fibres and
leaves in the natural em- broidery of the woods, set an example so
obvious that in all probability weav- ing was one of the earliest arts
of the human race. Bark, leaves and grass fibres were woven into
clothing, carpets and tapestry, sometimes so excellent that it could not
be rivaled today, even with the resources of contemporary machinery.
Aleutian women may spend a year in weaving one robe. The blankets and
garments made by the North American Indians were richly ornamented with
fringes and embroideries of hairs and tendon-threads dyed in brilliant
colors with berry juice; colors “so alive,” says Father Theodut, “that
ours do not seem even to approach them .” 21 Again art began
where</p></li>
<li><p>he put logs as rollers under the sledge; he cut cross-sections of
the log, and made the greatest of all mechanical inven- tions, the
wheel; he put wheels under the sledge and made a cart. Other logs he
bound together as rafts, or dug into canoes; and the streams be- came
his most convenient avenues of transport. By land he went first through
trackless fields and hills, then by trails, at last by roads. He studied
the stars, and guided his caravans across mountains and deserts by
tracing</p></li>
<li><p>The American Indians, content with this device, never used the
wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps one reason why communism tends to appear chiefly at the
beginning of civili- zations is that it flourishes most readily in times
of dearth, when the common danger of starvation fuses the individual
into the group. When abundance comes, and the danger subsides, social
cohesion is lessened, and individualism increases; communism ends where
luxury begins. As the life of a society becomes more complex, and the
division of labor differentiates men into diverse occupations and
trades, it becomes more and more unlikely that all these services will
be equally valuable to the group; inevitably those whose greater ability
enables them to perform the more vital functions will take more than
their equal share of the rising wealth of the group. Every growing
civilization is a scene of multiply - ing inequalities; the natural
differences of human endowment unite with differences of opportunity to
produce artificial differences of wealth and power; and where no laws or
despots suppress these artificial inequalities they reach at last a
bursting point where the poor have nothing to lose by violence, and the
chaos of revolution levels men again into a community of
destitution.</p></li>
<li><p>As the pressure of population increased, and older lands were
exhausted, such reclamation went on in a widening circle, until, in the
more complex societies, individual ownership became the order of the
day. The invention of money cooperated with these factors by facili-
tating the accumulation, transport and transmission of property. The old
tribal rights and traditions reasserted themselves in the technical
owner- ship of the soil by the village community or the king, and in
periodical redistributions of the land; but after an epoch of natural
oscillation between the old and the new, private property established
itself definitely as the basic economic institution of historical
society.</p></li>
<li><p>Inheritance added superior oppor- tunity to superior possessions,
and stratified once homogeneous societies into a maze of classes and
castes. Rich and poor became disruptively conscious of wealth and
poverty; the class war began to run as a red thread through all history;
and the state arose as an indispensable instru- ment for the regulation
of classes, the protection of property, the waging of war, and the
organization of peace.</p></li>
<li><p>So in our time that Mississippi of inventions which we call the
Industrial Revolution has enormously intensified the natural inequality
of men.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h4>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>Instead of democracy being a wilted feather in the cap of our own
age, it appears at its best in several primitive groups where such
government as exists is merely the rule of the family-heads of the clan,
and no arbitrary authority is allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>In the intervals of peace it was the priest, or head magician,
who had most authority and influence; and when at last a permanent
kingship developed as the usual mode of government among a majority of
tribes, it combined — and derived from — the offices of warrior, father
and priest. Societies are ruled by two powers: in peace by the word, in
crises by the sword; force is used only when indoctrination fails. Law
and myth have gone hand in hand throughout the centuries, cooperating or
taking turns in the manage- ment of mankind; until our own day no state
dared separate them, and perhaps tomorrow they will be united
again.</p></li>
<li><p>sufficiently to win his acceptance of the law and his adherence
to the State.</p></li>
<li><p>— or Law of Retaliation — embodied in Roman Law; it plays a large
role in the Code of Hammurabi, and in the “Mosaic” demand of “an eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth”; and it lurks behi nd most legal
punishments even in our day.</p></li>
<li><p>Since these fines or compositions, paid to avert revenge,
required some adjudication of offenses and damages, a third step towards
law was taken by the formation of courts; the chief or the elders or the
priests sat in judgment to settle the conflicts of their people. Such
courts were not always judgment seats; often they were boards of volun-
tary conciliation, which arranged some amicable settlement of the dis-
pute, f For many centuries, and among many peoples, resort to courts
remained optional; and where the offended party was dissatisfied with
the judgment rendered, he was still free to seek personal revenge .
23</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps an exception should be made in the case of the Brahmans,
who, by the Code of Manu (VIII, 336-8), were called upon to bear greater
punishments for the same crime than members of lower castes; but this
regulation was well honored in the breach.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li><p>the Lubus mated freely and indiscriminately, and had no
conception of marriage; certain tribes of Borneo lived in marriageless
association, freer than the birds; and among some peoples of primitive
Russia “the men utilize d the women without distinction, so that no
woman had her appointed husband.” African pygmies have been described as
having no marriage institutions, but as following “their animal
instincts wholly without restraint .” 5 This primitive “nationalization
of women,” corresponding to primitive com - munism in land and food,
passed away at so early a stage that few traces of it remain. Some
memory of it, however, lingered on in divers forms: in the feeling of
many nature peoples that monogamy — which they would define as the
monopoly of a woman by one man — is unnatural and immoral ; 3 in
periodic festivals of license (still surviving faintly in our Mardi
Gras), when sexual restraints were temporarily abandoned; in the demand
that a woman should give herself — as at the Temple of Mylitta in
Babylon — to any man that solicited her, before she would be allowed to
marry;</p></li>
<li><p>Caesar reported a similar custom in ancient Britain.” Survivals
of it appear in the “levirate,” a custom existing among the early Jews
and other ancient peoples, by which a man was obligated to marry his
brother’s widow ; 10 this was the rule that so irked Onan.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the suitor shortened the matter with plain, blunt
force. It was an advantage as well as a distinction to have stolen a
wife; not only would she be a cheap slave, but new slaves could be
begotten of her, and these children would chain her to her slavery. Such
marriage by capture, though not the rule, occurred sporadically in the
primitive world. Among the North American Indians the women were
included in the spoils of war, and this happened so frequently that in
some tribes the husbands and their</p></li>
<li><p>25 Vestiges of it remain in the custom of simulating the capture
of the bride by the groom in certain wedding ceremonies.</p></li>
<li><p>Briffault thinks that marriage by capture was a transition from
matrilocal to patri- archal marriage: the male, refusing to go and live
with the tribe or family of his wife, forced her to come to his . 36
Lippert believed that exogamy arose as a peaceable substitute for
capture ; 366 theft again graduated into trade.</p></li>
<li><p>8</p></li>
<li><p>At first modesty is the feeling of the woman that she is tabu in
her periods. When marriage</p></li>
<li><p>92</p></li>
<li><p>As tribes were gathered up into those larger units called states,
morality overflowed its tribal bounds; and as communication — or a
common danger — united and assimilated states, morals seeped through
fron- tiers, and some men began to apply their commandments to all
Europeans, to all whites, at last to all men. Perhaps there have always
been idealists who wished to love all men as their neighbors, and
perhaps in every gen- eration they have been futile voices crying in a
wilderness of nationalism and war. But probably the number — even the
relative number — of such men has increased. There are no morals in
diplomacy, and la politique rta pas (Tentrailles ; but there are morals
in international trade, merely because such trade cannot go on without
some degree of restraint, regulation, and con- fidence. Trade began in
piracy; it culminates in morality.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the range within which the moral code is applied has
narrowed since the Middle Ages, as the result of the rise of
nationalism.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gallas of Abyssinia ate in solemn ceremony the fish that they
worshiped, and said, “We feel the spirit</p></li>
<li><p>Freud, with characteristic imaginativeness, believes that the
totem was a transfigured symbol of the father, revered and hated for his
omnipotence, and rebelliously murdered and eaten by his sons. 117
Durkheim thought that the totem was a symbol of the clan, re vered and
hated (hence held “sacred” and “unclean”) by the individual for its
omnipo - tence and irksome dictatorship; and that the religious attitude
was originally the feeling of the individual toward die authoritarian
group. 118</p></li>
<li><p>The institution held the family power - fully together despite
the hostility of successive generations, and provided an invisible
structure for many early societies. And just as compulsion grew into
conscience, so fear graduated into love; the ritual of ancestor-
worship, probably generated by terror, later aroused the sentiment of
awe, and finally developed piety and devotion. It is the tendency of
gods to begin as ogres and to end as loving fathers; the idol passes
into an ideal as the growing security, peacefulness and moral sense of
the worshipers pacify and transform the features of their once ferocious
deities. The slow progress of civilization is reflected in the tardy
amiability of the gods.</p></li>
<li><p>Relics of ancestor-worship may be found among ourselves in our
care and visitation of graves, and our masses and prayers for the
dead.</p></li>

<li><p>origins of our own particular civilization. We wish now to
inquire briefly — for this is a field that only borders upon our purpose
— by what steps man, before history, prepared for the civilizations of
history: how the man of the jungle or the cave became an Egyptian
architect, a Babylonian astronomer, a Hebrew prophet, a Persian
governor, a Greek poet, a Roman engineer, a Hindu saint, a Japanese
artist, and a Chinese sage. We must pass from anthropology through
archeology to history.</p></li>
<li><p>This word will be used as applying to all ages before historical
records.</p></li>
<li><p>If we accept the precarious theories of contemporary science, the
creature who became man by learning to speak was one of the adaptable
species that survived from those frozen centuries. In the Interglacial
Stages, while the ice was retreating (and, for all we know, long before
that), this strange organism discovered fire, developed the art of
fashioning stone and bone into weapons and tools, and thereby paved the
way to civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>We are now in the Postglacial Stage, whose date of termination
has not been accurately calculated. These and other details have been
arranged more visibly in the table at the head of this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>and the Still Bay Culture of South Africa indicate that the Dark
Continent went through approximately the same prehistoric periods of
development in the art of flaking stone as those which we have outlined
in Europe; 8 perhaps, indeed, the quasi-Aurignacian remains in Tunis and
Algiers strengthen the hypothesis of an African origin or stopping-point
for the Cro-Magnon race, and there- fore for European man. 0 Paleolithic
implements have been dug up in Syria, India, China, Siberia, and other
sections of Asia; 10 Andrews and his Jesuit predecessors came upon them
in Mongolia; 11 Neanderthal skeletons and Mous- terian-Aurignacian
flints have been exhumed in great abundance in Palestine; and we have
seen how the oldest known human remains and implements have lately been
unearthed near Peiping. Bone tools have been discovered in Nebraska
which some patriotic authorities would place at 500,000 b.c.; arrow-
heads have been found in Oklahoma and New Mexico which their finders
assure us were made in 350,000 b.c. So vast was the bridge by which pre-
historic transmitted the foundations of civilization to historic
man.</p></li>
<li><p>Combarelles, Les Eyzies, Font de Gaume, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Amid these ruins were tools of bone and polished stone which
became for archeologists the distinguishing mark of the New Stone Age
that flourished some 10,000 b.c. in Asia, and some 5000 b.c. in Europe.
28 Akin to these remains are the gigantic tumuli left in the valleys of
the Mississippi and its tributaries by the strange race that we call the
Mound- Builders, and of which we know nothing except that in these
mounds, shaped in the form of altars, geometric figures, or totem
animals, are found objects of stone, shell, bone and beaten metal which
place these mysterious men at the end of the neolithic period.</p></li>
<li><p>Remains of similar lake dwellings have been found in France,
Italy, Scotland, Russia, North America, India, and elsewhere. Such
villages still exist in Borneo, Sumatra, New Guinea, etc. 20 Venezuela
owes its name (Little Venice) to the fact that when Alonso de Ojeda
discovered it for Europe (1499) he found the natives living in
pile-dwellings on Lake Maracaibo. 27</p></li>
<li><p>, 37 everything was ready for civilization.</p></li>
<li><p>pottery the New Stone Age has left us no art, nothing to com-
pare with the painting and statuary of paleolithic man. Here and there
among the scenes of neolithic life from England to China we find
circular heaps of stone called dolmens, upright monoliths called
menhirs, and gigantic</p></li>
<li><p>a million years. So young is the subject of our history.</p></li>
<li><p>If we accept “Peking Man” as early Pleistocene.</p></li>
<li><p>while commoners had still to be content with stone. 57 Even the
terms “Old Stone Age” and “New Stone Age” are precariously relative, and
de - scribe conditions rather than times; to this day many primitive
peoples (e.g., the Eskimos and the Polynesian Islanders) remain in the
Age of Stone, know- ing iron only as a delicacy brought to them by
explorers. Captain Cook bought several pigs for a sixpenny nail when he
landed in New Zealand in 1778; and another traveler described the
inhabitants of Dog Island as “covet - ous chiefly of iron, so as to want
to take the nails out of the ship.” 58 Bronze is strong and durable, but
the copper and tin which were needed to make it were not available in
such convenient quantities and locations as to provide man with the best
material for industry and war. Sooner or later iron had to come; and it
is one of the anomalies of history that, being so abundant, it did not
appear at least as early as copper and bronze. Men may have begun the
art by making weapons out of meteoric iron as the Mound- Builders seem
to have done, and as some primitive peoples do to this day; then,
perhaps, they melted it from the ore by fire, and hammered it into
wrought iron. Fragments of apparently meteoric iron have been found in
predynastic Egyptian tombs; and Babylonian inscriptions mention iron as
a costly rarity in Hammurabi’s capital (2100 b.c.). An iron foundry
perhaps four thousand years old has been discovered in Northern
Rhodesia; mining in South Africa is no modern invention. The oldest
wrought iron known is a group of knives found at Gerar, in Palestine,
and dated by Petrie about 1350 b.c. A century later the metal appears in
Egypt, in the reign of the great Rameses II; still another century and
it is found in the iEgean. In Western Europe it turns up first at
Hallstatt, Austria, ca. 900 b.c., and in the La Tene industry in
Switzerland ca. 500 b.c. It entered India with Alex- ander, America with
Columbus, Oceania with Cook. 50 In this leisurely way, century by
century, iron has gone about its rough conquest of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>A similar system appeared in Crete ca. 2500 b.c. We shall see
later how these hieroglyphics, represent- ing thoughts, were, by the
corruption of use, schematized and convention- alized into syllabaries —
i.e., collections of signs indicating syllables; and how at last signs
were used to indicate not the whole syllable but its initial sound, and
therefore became letters. Such alphabetic writing probably dates back to
3000 b.c. in Egypt; in Crete it appears ca. 1600 b.c. 66 The Phoenicians
did not create the alphabet, they marketed it; taking it appar- ently
from Egypt and Crete, 66 they imported it piecemeal to Tyre, Sidon and
Byblos, and exported it to every city on the Mediterranean; they were
the middlemen, not the producers, of the alphabet. By the time of Homer
the Greeks were taking over this Phoenician — or the allied Aramaic —
alpha- bet, and were calling it by the Semitic names of the first two
letters</p></li>
<li><p>lends some support to the legend so fascinatingly transmitted to
us by Plato,“ of a civilization that once flour- ished on an island
continent between Europe and Asia, and was suddenly lost when a
geological convulsion swallowed that continent into the sea. Schliemann,
the resurrector of Troy, believed that Atlantis had served as a
mediating link between the cultures of Europe and Yucatan, and that
Egyptian civilization had been brought from Atlantis.“ Perhaps America
itself was Atlantis, and some pre-Mayan culture may have been in touch
with Africa and Europe in neolithic times. Possibly every discovery is a
rediscovery.</p></li>

<li><p>Here is the oldest appearance not only of the potter’s wheel but
of the wagon wheel; this modest but vital vehicle of civilization is
found only later in Babylonia, and still later in Egypt.’ From these
already complex beginnings the Elamites rose to troubled power,
conquering Sumeria and Babylon, and being conquered by them, turn by
turn. The city of Susa survived six thousand years of history, lived
through the imperial zeniths of Sumeria, Babylonia, Egypt, Assyria,
Persia, Greece and Rome, and flourished, under the name of Shushan, as
late as the fourteenth century of our era. At various times it grew to
great wealth; when</p></li>
<li><p>This irrigation system, dating from 4000 b.c., was one of the
great achieve- ments of Sumerian civilization, and certainly its
foundation. Out of these carefully watered fields came abounding crops
of corn, barley, spelt, dates, and many vegetables. The plough appeared
early, drawn by oxen as even with us until yesterday, and already
furnished with a tubular seed- drill. The gathered harvest was threshed
by drawing over it great sledges of wood armed with flint teeth that cut
the straw for the cattle and</p></li>
<li><p>Even the king’s temple w as private, hidden away in his palace,
so that he might perform his religious duties without exposure, or
neglect them inconspicuously.</p></li>
<li><p>Presumably from repetition and haste over centuries of time, the
original pictures were gradually contracted into signs so unlike the
objects which they had once represented that they became the symbols of
sounds rather than of things. We should have an analogous process in
English if the picture of a bee should in time be shortened and
simplified, and come to mean not a bee but the sound be, and then serve
to indicate that syllable in any combination as in be-ing. The Sumerians
and Babylonians never ad- vanced from such representation of syllables
to the representation of letters — never dropped the vowel in the
syllabic sign to make be mean b; it seems to have remained for the
Egyptians to take this simple but revolu tionary step.“</p></li>
<li><p>62</p></li>
<li><p>Such ziggurats have helped American architects to mould a new
form for buildings forced by law to set back their upper stories lest
they impede their nei ghbor’s light. His - tory suddenly contracts into
a brief coup d’oeil when we contemplate in one glance the brick
ziggurats of Sumeria 5000 years old, and the brick ziggurats of
contemporary New York.</p></li>
<li><p>the form almost touches perfection. The ruins have given us a
great number of cylindrical seals, mostly made of precious metal or
stone, with reliefs carefully carved upon a square inch or two of
surface; these seem to have served the Sumerians in place of signatures,
and indicate a refinement of life and manners disturbing to our naive
conception of progress as a continuous rise of man through the
unfortunate cultures of the past to the unrivaled zenith of
today.</p></li>
<li><p>The original is in the Iraq Museum at Baghdad.</p></li>
<li><p>A great scholar, Elliot Smith, has tried to offset these
considerations by pointing out that although barley, millet and wheat
are not known in their natural state in Egypt, it is there that we find
the oldest signs of their cultivation; and he believes that it was from
Egypt that agriculture and civilization came to Sumeria . 82 The
greatest of American Egyptologists, Professor Breasted, is similarly
unconvinced of the priority of Sumeria. Dr. Breasted believes that the
wheel is at least as old in Egypt as in Sumeria, and rejects the
hypothesis of Schweinfurth on the ground that cereals have been found in
their native state in the highlands of Abyssinia.</p></li>

<li><p>in each of which the inhabitants were essentially of one stock,
acknowl- edged the same totem, obeyed the same chief, and worshiped the
same gods by the same rites. Throughout the history of ancient Egypt
these nomes persisted, their “nomarchs” or rulers having more or less
power and autonomy according to the weakness or strength of the reigning
Pharaoh. As all developing structures tend toward an increasing inter-
dependence of the parts, so in this case the growth of trade and the
rising</p></li>

traditions of the Egyp tian priests conce rning this builder of the
first of Gizeh’s pyramids:</p></li>

which is among the treasures of the Cairo Museum pictures him, if not as

<li><p>One of these early Pharaohs, Pepi II, ruled Egypt for ninety-four
years (2738-2644 b.c.) — the longest reign in history. When he died
anarchy and dissolution ensued, the Pharaohs lost control, and feudal
barons ruled the nomes independently: this alternation between
centralized and decentralized power is one of the cyclical rhythms of
his- tory, as if men tired alternately of immoderate liberty and
excessive order. After a Dark Age of four chaotic centuries a
strong-willed Charlemagne arose, set things severely in order, changed
the capital from Memphis to Thebes, and under the title of Amenemhet I
inaugurated that Twelfth Dynasty during which all the arts, excepting
perhaps architecture, reached a height of excellence never equaled in
known Egypt before or again. Through an old inscription Amenemhet speaks
to us:</p></li>
<li><p>Historians have helped themselves by further grouping the
dynasties into periods: (i) The Old Kingdom , Dynasties I-VI (3500-2631
b.c.), followed by an interlude of chaos; (2) The Middle Kingdom ,
Dynasties XI-XIV (2375-1800 b.c.), followed by another chaotic
interlude; (3) The Empire , Dynasties XVIII-XX (1580-1100 b.c.),
followed by a period of divided rule from rival capitals; and (4) The
Sa’ite Age , Dynasty XXVI, 663-</p></li>

<li><p>8 But Hatshepsut set this high-destined youngster aside, assumed
full royal powers, and proved herself a king in everything but
gender.</p></li>
<li><p>42</p></li>
<li><p>Allenby took twice as long to accomplish a similar result;
Napoleon, attempting it at Acre, failed.</p></li>
<li><p>Herodotus describes them optimistically as he found them about
450 B.C.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of Egypt in the fourth century before Christ is
estimated at some 7,000,000 souls. 48</p></li>
<li><p>57</p></li>
<li><p>The great wars brought in thousands of captives, making possible
the large estates and the triumphs of engineering. Rameses III presented
1 13,000 slaves to the temples during the course of his reign. 66 The
free artisans were usually organized for the specific undertaking by a
“chief workman” or overseer, who sold their labor as a group and paid
them individually. A chalk tablet in the British Museum contains a chief
workman’s record of forty -three workers, listing their absences and
their causes — “ill,” or “sacrificing to the god,” or just plain “lazy.”
Strikes were frequent. Once, their pay being long overdue, the workmen
besieged the overseer and threatene d him. “We have been driven here by
hunger and thirst,” they told him; “we have no clothes, we have no oil,
we have no food. Write to our lord the Pharaoh on the sub- ject, and
write to the governor” (of the nome) “who is over us, that they may give
us something for our sustenance.” 67 A Greek tradition reports a great
revolt in Egypt, in which the slaves captured a province, and held it so
long that time, which sanctions everything, gave them legal ownership of
it; but of this revolt there is no record in Egyptian inscriptions. 68
It is surprising that a civilization so ruthless in its exploitation of
labor should have known — or recorded — so few revolutions.</p></li>
<li><p>“If any artisan,” adds Diodorus, “takes part in public affairs he
is severely beaten .” 65 t This word, when used in reference to rulers,
must always be understood as a euphemism.</p></li>
<li><p>The subjects were largely commercial, for the Egyptians were the
first and greatest utilitarians; but the chief topic of

<li><p>143 Libraries have come down to us from as far back as 2000 b.c.
— papyri rolled and packed in jars, labeled, and ranged. on shelves ;

<li><p>A later group of funerary inscriptions, written in ink upon the
inner sides of the wooden coffins used to inter certain nobles and
magnates of the Middle Kingdom, have been gathered together by Breasted
and others under the name of “Coffin Texts.” 144</p></li>
<li><p>75</p></li>
<li><p>181 Our knowledge does not permit us to improve sub- stantially
upon this theory of the origins of science in Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p>So we are assured by Iamblichus (ca. 300 a.d.). Manetho, the
Egyptian historian (ca. 300 b.c.) , would have considered this estimate
unjust to the god; the proper number of Thoth’s works, in his reckoning,
was 36,000. The Greeks celebrated Thoth under the name of Hermes
Trismegistus — Hermes (Mercury) the Thrice-Great. 102</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the twelfth month they added five days to bring the
year into harmony with the river and the sun. 174 As the beginning of
their year they chose the day on which the Nile usually reached its
height, and on which, originally, the great star Sirius (which they
called Sothis) rose simultaneously with the sun. Since their calendar
allowed only 365, instead of 365 54 , days to a year, this “heliacal
rising” of Sirius (i.e., its appearance just before sunrise, after
having bee n invisible for a number of days) came a day later every four
years; and in this way the Egyptian calendar diverged by six hours
annually from the actual calendar of the sky. The Egyptians never
corrected this error. Many years later (46 b.c.) the Greek astronomers
of Alexandria, by direction of Julius Caesar, improved this calendar by
adding an extra day every fourth year; this was the “Julian Calendar.”
Under Pope Gregory XIII (1582)</p></li>
<li><p>The clepsydra, or water-clock, was so old with the Egyptians that
they attributed its invention to their handy god-of-all-trades, Thoth.
The oldest clock in existence dates from Thutmose III, and is now in the
Berlin Museum. It consists of a bar of wood, divided into six parts or
hours, upon which a crosspiece was so placed that its shadow on the bar
would indicate the time of the morning or the afternoon. 178</p></li>
<li><p>The tomb of an Eleventh Dynasty queen revealed a medicine chest
con- taining vases, spoons, dried drugs, and roots. Prescriptions
hovered between medicine and magic, and relied for their effectiveness
in great part on the repulsiveness of the concoction. Lizard’s blood,
swine’s ears and teeth,</p></li>
<li><p>by cir-</p></li>
<li><p>was the noblest of the ancient arts, because it combined in
imposing form mass and duration, beauty and use. It began humbly in the
adornment of tombs and the external decoration of homes. Dwellings were
mostly of mud, with here and there some pretty woodwork (a Japanese
lattice, a well-carved portal), and a roof strengthened with the tough
and pliable trunks of the palm. Around the house, normally, was a wall
enclosing a court; from the court steps led to the roof; from this the
tenants passed down into the rooms. The well-to-do had private gardens,
carefully landscaped; the cities provided public gardens for the poor,
and hardly a home but had its ornament of flowers. Inside the house the
walls were hung with colored mattings, and the floors, if the master
could afford it, were covered with rugs. People sat on these rugs rather
than on chairs; the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom squatted for
their</p></li>
<li><p>The Egyptians • were the greatest builders in history.</p></li>
<li><p>A clerestory is that portion of a building which, being above the
roof of the sur- rounding parts, admits light to the edifice by a series
of openings. An architrave is the lowest part of an entablature — which
is a superstructure supported by a colonnade.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sheik is no sheik but only an over- seer of labor, armed with
the staff of authority, and stepping forward as if in supervision or
command. His name, apparently, was Kaapiru; but the Arab workmen who
rescued kirn from his tomb at Salckara were struck with his resemblance
to the Sheik-el-Beled (i.e., Mayor-of-the-Village) under whom they
lived; and this title which their good humor gave him is now inseparable
from his fame. He is carved only in mortal wood, but time has not
seriously reduced his portly figure or his chubby legs; his waistline
has all the amplitude of the comfortable bourgeois in every
civilization; his rotund face beams with the content of a man who knows
his place and glories in it. The bald head and carelessly loosened robe
display the realism of an art already old enough to rebel against
idealiza- tion; but here, too, is a fine simplicity, a complete
humanity, expressed without bitterness, and with the ease and grace-of a
practised and confident hand. “If,” says Maspero, “some exhibition of
the world’s masterpieces</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. p. 161 above. Other scribes adorn the Cairo Museum, and the
State Museum at Berlin.</p></li>
<li><p>that not much attention given to the body, which was left in most
cases stereotyped and unreal — all female bodies young, all royal bodies
strong; and that individualization, though masterly, was generally
reserved for the head. But with all the stiffness and sameness that
priestly conventions and control forced upon statuary, paintings and
reliefs, these works were fully redeemed by the power and depth of the
conception, the vigor and precision of the execution, the character,
line and finish of the product. Never was sculpture more alive: the
Sheik exudes authority, the woman grinding grain gives every sense and
muscle to her work, the Scribe is on the very verge of writing. And the
thousand little puppets placed in the tombs to carry on essential in-
dustries for the dead were moulded with a like vivacity, so that we can
almost believe, with the pious Egyptian, that the deceased could not be
unhappy while these ministrants were there.</p></li>
<li><p>There are important exceptions to this — e.g., the Sheik-el-Beled
and the Scribe; obvi- ously the convention was not due to incapacity or
ignorance.</p></li>
<li><p>the perfect crouching figure of the same incredible monarch
making an offering to the gods; 1 ™ the meditative cow of Der -el-Bahri,
which Maspero considered “equal, if not superior, to the best
achievements of Greece and Rome in this genre”;™ the two lions of
Amenhotep III, wh ich Ruskin ranked as the best animal statuary
surviving from antiquity ; 201 the colossi cut into the rocks at Abu
Simbel by the sculptors of Rameses II; the amaz- ing remains found among
the ruins of the artist Thutmose’s studio at Tell - el-Amama — a p
laster model of Ikhnaton’s head, full of the mysticism and poetry of
that tragic king, the lovely limestone bust of Ikhnaton’s Queen,
Nofretete, and the even finer sandstone head of the same fair lady : 202
these scattered examples may illustrate the sculptural accomplishments
of this abounding Empire age. Amid all these lofty masterpieces humor
continues to find place; Egyptian sculptors frolic with jolly
caricatures of men and animals, and even the kings and queens, in
Ikhnaton’s iconoclastic age, a re made to smile and play.</p></li>
<li><p>One is reminded here of the remark of an Egyptian statesman,
after visiting the galleries of Europe: “ Que vous avez vole mon pays !—
How you have raped my country! ” 188</p></li>
<li><p>Again they delighted in catching the actual features and
movements of men and beasts; they moulded laughable figures of quaint
animals, slaves and gods; and they formed in bronze a cat and a goat’s
head which are among the trophies of Berlin. 2 ” Then the Persians came
down like a wolf on the fold, conquered Egypt, desecrated its temples,
broke its spirit, and put an end to its art.</p></li>
<li><p>— are the major Egyptian arts; but if abundance counted,
bas-relief would have to be added to them. No other people so tirelessly
carved its history or legends upon its walls. At first we are shocked by
the dull similarity of these glyptic narratives, the crowded confusion,
the absence of proportion and perspective — or the ungainly attempt to
achieve this by representing the far above the near; we are surprised to
see how tall the Pharaoh is, and how small are his enemies; and, as in
the sculpture, we find it hard to adjust our pictorial habits to eyes
and breasts that face us boldly, while noses, chins and feet turn coldly
away. But then we find ourselves caught by the perfect line and grace of
the falcon and serpent carved on King W enephes’ tomb, 20 ” by the
limestone reliefs of King Zoser on the Step-Pyramid at Sakkara, by the
wood-relief of Prince Hesire from his grave in the same locality , 207
and by the wounded Libyan on a Fifth Dynasty tomb at Abusir 203 — a
patient study of muscles taut in pain. At last we bear with equanimity
the long reliefs that tell how Thutmose III and Rameses II carried all
before them; we recognize the perfection of flowing line in the reliefs
carved for Seti I at Abydos and Kamak; and we follow with interest the
picturesque en- gravings wherein the sculptors of Hatshepsut tell on the
walls of Der-el- Bahri the story of the expedition sent by her to the
mysterious land of Punt (Somaliland?). We see the long ships with
full-spread sail and serried oars heading south amid waters alive with
octopi, Crustacea and other toilers of the sea; we watch the fleet
arriving on the shores of Punt, wel- comed by a startled but fascinated
people and Icing; we see the sailors</p></li>

<li><p>Temples and palaces had orchestras and choirs, and on the
Pharaoh’s staff was a “superintendent of singing” who organized players
and musicians for the entertainment of the king. There is no trace of a
musical notation in Egypt, but this may be merely a lacuna in the
remains. Snefrunofr and Re’mery -Ptah were the Carusos and De Reszkes of
their day, and across the centuries we hear their boast that they
“fulfil every wish of the king by their beautiful singing .””®</p></li>

sounding-board; the sistrum was a group of small discs shaken on

<li><p>13 Ptah-hotep was Governor of Memphis, and Prime Minister to the
King, under the Fifth Dynasty. Retiring from office, he decided to leave
to his son a manual of everlasting wisdom. It was transcribed as an
antique classic by some scholars prior to the Eighteenth Dynasty. The
Vizier begins:</p></li>

<li><p>97</p></li>
<li><p>In part such literature represents one of those interludes, like
our own moral interregnum, in which thought has for a time overcome
belief, and men no longer know how or why they should live. Such periods
do not endure; hope soon wins the victory over thought; the intellect is
put down to its customary menial place, and religion is bom again,
giving to men the imaginative stimulus apparently indispensable to life
and work. We need not suppose that such poems expressed the views of any
large number of Egyptians; behind and around the small but vital
minority that pondered the problems of life and death in secular and
naturalistic terms were millions of simple men and women who remained
faithful to the gods, and never doubted that right would triumph, that
every earthly pain and grief would be atoned for bountifully in a haven
of happiness and peace.</p></li>
<li><p>99</p></li>
<li><p>Signs of sex worship appear not only in the many cases in which
figures are depicted, on temple reliefs, with erect organs, but in the
frequent appearance, in Egyptian symbolism, of the crux ansata — a cross
with a handle, as a sign of sexual union and vigorous life .

<li><p>There was Osiris, for ex- ample, god of the beneficent Nile,
whose death and resurrection were celebrated yearly as symbolizing the
fall and rise of the river, and perhaps the decay and growth of the
soil. Every Egyptian of the later dynasties could tell the story of how
Set (or Sit), the wicked god of desiccation, who shriveled up harvests
with his burning breath, was angered at Osiris (the Nile) for extending
(with his overflow) the fertility of the earth, slew him, and reigned in
dry majesty over Osiris’ kingdom (i.e., the river once failed to rise),
until Horus, brave son of Isis, overcame Set and</p></li>
<li><p>scrolls for which the priests had written prayers, for- mulas and
charms calculated to appease, even to deceive, Osiris. When, after a
hundred vicissitudes and perils, the dead soul at last reached Osiris,
it was to address the great Judge in some such manner as this:</p></li>
<li><p>A modem tide given by Lepsius to some two thousand papyrus rolls
found in vari- ous tombs, and distinguished by containing formulas to
guide the dead. The Egyptian tide is Coming Forth (from death) by Day.
They date from the Pyramids, but some are even older. The Egyptians
believed that these texts had been composed by the god of wisdom, Thoth;
chapter lxiv announced that the book had been found at Heliopolis, and
was “in the very handwriting of the god .” 280 Josiah made a similar
discovery among the Jews; cf. Chap, xn, § v below.</p></li>
<li><p>” In the end the connection between morality and religion tended
to be for- gotten; the road to eternal bliss led not through a good
life, but through magic, ritual, and generosity to the priests. Let a
great Egyptologist ex- press the matter:</p></li>
<li><p>8</p></li>
<li><p>he composed passionate songs to Aton, of which this, the longest
and the best, is the fairest surviving remnant of Egyptian
literature:</p></li>
<li><p>Under Amenhotep m the architects Suti and Hor had inscribed a
monotheistic hymn to the sun upon a stele now in the British Museum .
281 It had long been the custom in Egypt to address the sun-god,
Amon-Ra, as the greatest god , 282 but only as the god of
Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps, as Breasted” 8 suggests, this conception of one sole god
was a reflex of the unification of the Mediterranean world under Egypt
by Thutmose III. Ikhnaton conceives his god as belonging to all
nations</p></li>
<li><p>The obvious similarity of this hymn to Psalm CIV leaves little
doubt of Egyptian in - fluence upon the Hebrew poet . 204</p></li>
<li><p>”</p></li>
<li><p>The dependencies of Egypt in the Near East were being invaded by
Hittites and other neighboring tribes; the governors appointed by Egypt
pleaded for immediate reinforcements. Ikhnaton hesitated; he was not
quite sure that the right of conquest warranted him in keeping these
states in sub- jection to Egypt; and he was loath to send Egyptians to
die on distant fields for so uncertain a cause. When the dependencies
saw that they were dealing with a saint, they deposed their Egyptian
governors, quietly</p></li>
<li><p>In 1893 Sir William Flinders Petrie discovered at Tell-el-Amarna
over three hundred and fifty cuneiform letter-tablets, most of which
were appeals for aid addressed to Ikhnaton by the East.</p></li>
<li><p>” He had his victories commemorated, without undue impartiality,
on half a hundred walls, commissioned a poet to celebrate him in epic
verse, and rewarded himself with several hundred wives. When he died he
left one hundred sons and fifty daughters to testify to his quality by
their number and their proportion. He married several of his daughters,
so that they too might have splendid children. His offspring were so
numerous that they con- stituted for four hundred years a special class
in Egypt, from which, for over a century, her rulers were
chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>74 The generous or timorous Rameses III showered unparalleled
gifts upon the priests of Amon, including 32,000 kilograms of gold and a
million kilograms of silver;</p></li>
<li><p>78 More and more the people starved in order that the gods might
eat.</p></li>
<li><p>The history of classical Egyptian civilization under the
Ptolemies and the Caesars be- longs to a later volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Through the Phoenicians, the Syrians and the Jews, through the
Cretans, the Greeks and the Romans, the civilization of Egypt passed
down to become part of the cultural heritage of mankind. The effect or
remembrance of what Egypt accomplished at the very dawn of history has
influence in every nation and every age. “It is even possible,” as Faure
has said, “that Egypt, through the solidarity, the uni ty, and the
disciplined variety of its artistic products, through the enormous
duration and the sus- tained power of its effort, offers the spectacle
of the greatest civilization that has yet appeared on the earth.”’“ 8 We
shall do well to equal it.</p></li>

busy with commerce and spanned by a handsome bridge.“t Practically all
the better buildings were of brick, for stone was rare in Mesopotamia;
but the bricks were often faced with enameled tiles of brilliant blue,
yellow or white, adorned with animal and other figures in glazed relief,
which remain to this day supreme in their kind. Nearly all the bricks so
far recovered fr om the site of Babylon bear the proud inscription: “I
am Nebuchad - rezzar, King of Babylon.” 21</p></li>
<li><p>Probably this included not only the city proper but a large
agricultural hinterland within the walls, designed to provide the
teeming metropolis with sustenance in time of siege.</p></li>
<li><p>South of the ziggurat stood the gigantic Temple of Marduk,
tutelary deity of Babylon. Around and below this temple the city spread
itself out in a few wide and brilliant avenues, crossed by crowded
canals and narrow winding streets alive, no doubt, with traffic and
bazaars, and Orientally odorous with garbage and humanity. Con- necting
the temples was a spacious “Sacred Way,” paved with asphalt - covered
bricks overlaid with flags of limestone and red breccia-, over this the
gods might pass without muddying their feet. This broad avenue was
flanked with walls of colored tile, on which stood out, in low relief,
one hundred and twenty brightly enameled lions, snarling to keep the
impious away. At one end of the Sacred Way rose the magnificent</p></li>

<li><p>orable tool had already a long history behind it in the Land
between the Rivers; and yet it was modern enough, for though it was
drawn by oxen in the manner of our fathers, it had, attached to the
plough, as in Sumeria, a tube through which the seed was sown in the
manner of our children. 26 The waters of the rising rivers were not
allowed to flood the land as in Egypt; on the contrary, every farm was
protected from the inundation by ridges of earth, some of which can
still be seen today. The overflow was guided into a complex network of
canals, or stored into reservoirs, from which it was sluiced into the
fields as needed, or raised over the ridges by shadufs — buckets lifted
and lowered on a pivoted and revolving pole. Neb- uchadrezzar
distinguished his reign by building many canals, and gather- ing the
surplus waters of the overflow into a reservoir, one hundred and forty
miles in circumference, which nourished by its outlets vast areas of
land. 27 Ruins of these canals can be seen in Mesopotamia today, and —
as if further to bind the quick and the dead — the primitive shaduf is
still in use in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Loire. 28</p></li>
<li><p>Loans were made in goods or currency, but at a high rate of
interest, fixed by the state at 20per per annum for loans of money, and
33per for loans in kind; even these rates were exceeded by lenders who
could hire clever scribes to circumvent the law. 30 There were no banks,
but certain powerful families carried on from generation to generation
the business of lending money; they dealt also in real estate, and
financed indus- trial enterprises; 40 and persons who had funds on
deposit with such men could pay their obligations by written drafts. 41
The priests also made loans, particu- larly to finance the sowing and
reaping of the crops. The law occasionally took the side of the debtor:
e.g., if a peasant mortgaged his farm, and through storm or drought or
other “act of God” had no harvest from his toil, then no in - terest
could be exacted from him in that year. 43 But for the most part the law
was written with an eye to protecting property and preventing
losses;</p></li>
<li><p>The first judges were priests, and to the end of Baby- lonian
history the courts were for the most part located in the temples;“ but
already in the days of Hammurabi secular courts responsible only to the
government were replacing the judgment-seats presided over by the
clergy.</p></li>
<li><p>1 If a house collapsed and killed the purchaser, the architect or
builder must die; if the accident killed the buyer’s son, the son of the
architect or builder must die; if a man struck a girl and killed her not
he but his daughter must suffer the penalty of death . 68 Gradually
these punishments in kind were replaced by awards of damages; a payment
of money was permitted as an alternative to the physical retaliation ,
68 and later the fine became the sole punishment. So the eye of a
commoner might be knocked out for sixty shekels of silver, and the eye
of a slave might be knocked out for thirty. 6</p></li>

religion was terrestrially practical; when he prayed he asked not for
celestial rewards but for earthly goods ; 83 he could not trust his gods
beyond the grave. It is true that one text speaks of Marduk as he “who
gives back life to the dead ,” 84 and the story of the flood represents
its two survivors as living forever. But for the most part the
Babylonian con- ception of another life was like that of the Greeks:
dead men — saints and vil- lains, geniuses and idiots, alike — went to a
dark and shadowy realm within the bowels of the earth, and none of them
saw the light again. There was a heaven, but only for the gods; the
Aralu to which all men descended was a place frequently of punishment,
never of joy; there the dead lay bound hand and foot forever, shivering
with cold, and subject to hunger and thirst unless their children placed
food periodically in their graves . 85 Those who had been especially
wicked on earth were subjected to horrible tortures; leprosy consumed
them, or some other of the diseases which Nergal and Allat, male and
female lords of Aralu, had arranged for their rectification.</p></li>
<li><p>to burn incense before them, clothe them with rich vestments, or
adorn them with jewelry; to offer up the virginity of their daughters in
the great festival of Ishtar; to put food and drink before the gods, and
to be generous to the priests — these were the essential works of the
devout Babylonian soul . 98</p></li>
<li><p>The</p></li>
<li><p>Morals grew lax when the templ es grew rich; and the citizens of
Babylon, wedded to delight, bore with equanimity the subjection of their
city by the Kassites, the Assyrians, the Persians, and the

immortality, because of its apparent power to escape death by moulting

sumed; the priest-scientists plotted the orbits of sun and moon, noted
their conjunctions and eclipses, calculated the courses of the planets,
and made the first clear distinction between a planet and a
star;</p></li>

13 the official his- torian, on his life, did not understate these
figures. Then, irritated by the prejudice of Babylon in favor of
freedom, he besieged it, took it, and burned it to the ground; nearly
all the inhabitants, young and old, male and female, were put to death,
so that mountains of corpses blocked the streets; the temples and

b.c. iron replaced bronze as the basic metal of industry and armament.
35 Metal was cast, glass was blown, textiles were dyed,t earthenware was
enameled, and houses were as well equipped in Nineveh as in Europe
before the Industrial Revolution. 33 During the reign of Sennacherib an
aqueduct was built which brought water to Nineveh from thirty miles
away; a thousand feet of it, recently discovered, t constitute the
oldest aqueduct known. In- dustry and trade were financed in part by
private bankers, who charged 25per for loans. Lead, copper, silver and
gold served as currency; and about 700 b.c. Sennacherib minted silver
into half-shekel pieces — one of our earliest examples of an official
coinage. 87</p></li>
<li><p>Other products of Assyrian cultivation were olives, grapes,
garlic, onions, lettuce, cress, beets, turnips, radishes, cucumbers,

majestic horses of Sargon II on the reliefs at Khorsabad ;” 0 the
wounded lioness from Sennacherib’s palace at Nine - veh ;” 1 the dying
lion in alabaster from the palace of Ashurbanipal ; 62 the lion- hunts
of Ashumasirpal II and Ashurbanipal ;“ the resting lioness,“ and the
lion released from a trap;“ the fragment in which a lion and his mate
bask in the shade of the trees””— these are among the world’s choicest
mas - terpieces in this form of art. The representation of natural
objects in the reliefs is stylized and crude; the forms are heavy, the
outlines are hard, the muscles are exaggerated; and there is no other
attempt at perspective than the placing of the distant in the upper half
of the picture, on the same scale as the foreground presented below.
Gradually, however, the guild of sculptors under Sennacherib learned to
offset these defects with a boldly realistic portrayal, a technical
finish, and above all a vivid percep- tion of action, which, in the
field of animal sculpture, have never been surpassed. Bas-relief was to

conquests had helped to weaken her; not only had they depopulated her
fields to feed insatiate Mars, but they had brought into Assyria, as
captives, millions of destitute aliens who bred with the fertility of
the hopeless, destroyed all national unity of character and blood, and
became by their growing numbers a hostile and disintegrating force in
the very midst of the conquerors. More and more the army itself was
filled by these men of other lands, while semi-barbarous maraud- ers
harassed every border, and exhausted the resources of the country in an
endless defense of its unnatural frontiers.</p></li>

the state by that greed and extravagance which posterity represented
through the legend of his plea to the gods that he might turn anything
to gold by touching it. The plea was so well heard that everything Midas
touched turned to gold, even the food that he put to his lips; he was on
the verge of starvation when the gods allowed him to cleanse himself of
the curse by bathing in the river Pactolus — which has given up grains
of gold</p></li>
<li><p>never- theless they set an example that stimulated trade
throughout the Mediter- ranean world. Men had for many centuries used
various metals as stand- ards of value and exchange; but these, whether
copper, bronze, iron, silver or gold, had in most countries been
measured by weight or other tests at each transaction. It was no small
improvement that replaced such cumbersome tokens with a national
currency; by accelerating the passage of goods from those that could
best produce them to those that most effectively demanded them it added
to the wealth of the world, and pre- pared for mercantile civilizations
like those of Ionia and Greece, in which the proceeds of commerce were
to finance the achievements of literature and art.</p></li>

founded the city in what we should call the twenty-eighth century before
Christ . 17 Even their name is problematical: the phoinix from which the
Greeks coined it may mean the red dye that Tyrian merchants sold, or a
palm-tree that flourishes along the Phoenician coast. That coast, a
narrow strip a hundred miles long and only ten miles wide, between Syria
and the sea, was almost all of Phoenicia; the people never thought it
worth while to settle in the Lebanon hills behind them, or to bring
these ranges under their rule; they were content that this beneficent
barrier should protect them from the more warlike nations whose goods
they carried out into all the lanes of the sea.</p></li>

Aramaeans, spreading everywhere, made their language the lingua franca
of the Near East, and that the alphabetic script which they had learned
either from the Egyptians or the Phoenicians replaced the cuneiform and
syllabaries of Mesopotamia, first as a mercantile, then as a literary,
medium, and became at last the tongue of Christ and the alphabet of the
Arabs today.“ But time preserves their names not so much because of
their own accom- plishments as because they played some part on the
tragic stage of Pales- tine. We must study, in greater detail than their
neighbors, these numer- ically and geographically insignificant Jews,
who gave to the world one of its greatest literatures, two of its most
influential religions, and so many of its profoundest men.</p></li>

<li><p>It becomes apparent that the different dates at which we begin
the history of divers peoples are merely the marks of our ignorance. The
Tell-el-Amarna letters carry on the general picture of Palestinian and
Syrian life almost to the entrance of the Jews into the valley of the
Nile. It is probable, though not certain, that the “Habiru” spoken of in
this correspondence were Hebrews. # ‘</p></li>
<li><p>The discoveries here summarized have restored considerable credit
to those chapters of Genesis that record the early traditions of the
Jews. In its outlines, and barring supernatural incidents, the story of
the Jews as unfolded in the Old Testament has stood the test of
criticism and archeology; every year adds corroboration from documents,
monuments, or excavations. E.g., potsherds unearthed at Tel Ad-Duweir in
1935 bore Hebrew inscriptions confirming part of the narrative of the
Books of Kings. 48 We must accept the Biblical account provisionally
until it is disproved. Cf. Petrie, Egypt and Israel , London, 1925,
p. 108.</p></li>
<li><p>We may take it as likely that the immi- grants were at .first a
modest number, 11 and that the many thousands of Jews in Egypt in Moses’
time were the consequence of a high birth rate; as in all periods, “the
more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.” 13 The
story of the “bondage” in Egypt, of the use of the Jews as slaves in
great construction enterprises, their rebellion and escape — or
emigration — to Asia, has many internal signs of essential truth,
mingled, of course, with supernatural interpolations customary in all
the historical writing of the ancient East. Even the story of Moses must
not be rejected offhand; it is astonishing, however, that no mention is
made of him by either Amos or Isaiah, whose preaching appears to have
preceded by a century the composition of the Pentateuch, f</p></li>

about 1220 b . c . 10</p></li>

and many maidens, half -naked dancer of wild dances , 88 seductive
player of the harp, sweet singer of marvelous songs, and able king of
the Jews for almost forty years. Here, so early in literature, is a
character fully drawn, real with all the contradictory passions of a
living soul: as ruthless as his</p></li>

<li><p>On the value of the talent in the ancient Near East cf. p. 228
above. The value varied from time to time; but we should not be
exaggerating it if we rated the talent, in Solomon’s day, as having a
purchasing power of over 0,000 in our contemporary money. Probably the
Hebrew writer spoke in a literary way, and we must not take his figures
too seriously. On the fluctuations of Hebrew currency cf. the Jewish
Encyclopedia , articles “Numismatics” and “Shekel.” Coinage, as distinct
from rings or ingots of silver or gold, does not appear in Palestine
until about 650 b.c . 38</p></li>
<li><p>The design was in the style that the Phoenicians had adopted from
Egypt, with decorative ideas from Assyria and Babylon. The Temple was
not a church, but a quadrangular enclosure composed of several
buildings. The main struc- ture was of modest dimensions — about one
hundred and twenty-four feet in length, fifty-five in breadth, and
fifty-two in height; half the length of the Parthenon, a quarter of the
length of Chartres . 10 The Hebrews who came from all- Judea to
contribute to the Temple, and later to wor- ship in it, forgivably
looked upon it as one of the wonders of the world; they had not seen the
immensely greater temples of Thebes, Babylon and Nineveh. Before the
main structure rose a “porch” some one hundred and eighty feet high,
overlaid with gold. Gold was spread lavishly about, if we may credit our
sole authority: on the beams of the main ceiling, on the posts, the
doors and the walls, on the candelabra, the lamps, the snuffers , the
spoons, the censers, and “a hundred basins of gold.” Precious stones
were inlaid here and there, and two gold-plated cherubim guarded the Ark
of the Covenant.“ The walls were of great square stones; the ceil- ing,
posts and doors were of carved cedar and olive wood. Most of

mercy to whom I will show mercy .” 83 He approves Jacob’s use of deceit
in revenging himself upon Laban ; 83 his conscience is as flexible as
that of a bishop in politics. He is talkative, and likes to make

polytheism of Babylonia and Greece, Judaism was immensely superior to

Jews the first clear revelation of monotheism, and offered them a new
god, in- finitely richer in “lovingkindness” and tender mercy than the
bitter Yah - veh even of the First Isaiah. In words that a later gospel
was to choose as spurring on the young Christ, this greatest of Prophets
announced his mission — no longer to curse the people for their sins,
but to bring them hope in their bondage. “The Spirit of the Lord God is
upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto

liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are

bases of Hebrew society. Property was almost entirely in land; until the
days of Solomon there was little industry beyond that of the potter and
the smith. Even agriculture was not completely developed; the bulk of
the population devoted itself to rear- ing sheep and cattle, and tending
the vine, the olive and the fig. They lived in tents rather than houses,
in order to move more easily to fresh pastures. In time their growing
economic surplus generated trade, and the Jewish mer- chants, by their
tenacity and their skill, began to flourish in Damascus, Tyre and Sidon,
and in the precincts of the Temple itself. There was no coinage till
near the time of the Captivity, but gold and silver, weighed in each
trans - action, became a medium of exchange, and bankers appeared in
great numbers to finance commerce and enterprise. It was nothing strange
that these “money - lenders” should use the courts of the Temple; it was
a custom gen - eral in the Near East, and survives there in many places
to this day . 106 Yahveh beamed upon the growi ng power of the Hebrew
financiers; “thou shalt lend unto many nations,” he said, “but thou
shalt not borrow” 197 — a generous phil- osophy that has made great
fortunes, though it has not seemed, in our cen- tury, to be divinely
inspired.</p></li>
<li><p>Never - theless, it was an admirable precept; could men follow
it, half the fever and anxiety of our life would be removed. Strange to
say, the greatest of the commandments is not listed among the Ten,

amid “a repetition of sundry laws,” and reads very simply: “Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.”</p></li>

it was honored plentifully in the breach, and won new praise with every

as great as that of most legal or moral codes. It gave to the Jews,
through the two thousand years of wandering which they were soon to
begin, a “portable Fatherland,” as Heine was to call it, an intangible
and spirtual state; it kept them united despite every dispersion, proud
despite every defeat, and brought them across the centuries to our own
time, a strong and apparently indestructi- ble people.</p></li>

the ruling caste of northern India. Darius I, in an inscription at

Persians took to writing they adopted the Babylonian cuneiform for their
inscriptions, and the Aramaic alphabetic script for their documents . 23
They simplified the unwieldly syllabary of the Babylonians from three
hundred characters to thirty-six signs which gradually became letters
instead of syllables, and constituted a cuneiform alphabet . 34 Writing,
however, seemed to the Persians an effeminate amusement, for which they
could spare little time from love, war and the chase. They did not con-

Persian monarchy. Since lesser kings were vassal to him, the Persian
ruler entitled himself “King of Kings,” and the ancient world made no
protest against his claim; the Greeks called him simply Basileus — The
King . 94 His power was theoretically absolute; he could loll with a
word, without trial or reason given, after the manner of some very
modern dictator; and occasionally he delegated to his mother or his
chief wife this privilege of capricious slaughter . 95 Few even of the
greatest nobles dared offer any criticism or rebuke, and public opinion
was cautiously impotent. The father whose innocent son had been shot
before his eyes by the king merely complimented the monarch on his
excellent archery; offenders bastinadoed by the royal order thanked His
Majesty for keeping them in mind.“ The king might rule as well as reign,
if, like Cyrus and the first Darius, he cared to bestir himself; but the
later monarchs dele- gated most of the cares of government to noble
subordinates or imperial eunuchs, and spent their time at love, dice or
the chase . 87 The court was overrun with eunuchs who, from their coigns
of vantage as guards of the harem and pedagogues to the princes, stewed
a poisonous brew of intrigue in every reign.f 38 The king had the right
to choose his successor from among his sons, but ordinarily the

Zarathustra had interpreted Ahura-Mazda as having seven as- pects or

<li><p>” Man’s duty, says the Avesta, is three - fold: “To make him who
is an enemy a friend; to make him who is wicked righteous; and to make
him who is ignorant learned.”” The greatest virtue is piety; second o
nly to that is honor and honesty in action and speech. Interest was not
to be charged to Persians, but loans were to be looked upon as almost
sacred.” The worst sin of all (in the Avestan as in the Mosaic code) is
unbelief. We may judge from the severe punishments with which it was
honored that scepticism existed among the Persians; death was to be
visited upon the apostate without delay.” The generosity and kindliness
enjoined by the Master did not apply, in practice, to infidels — i.e.,
foreigners; these were inferior species of men, whom Ahura-Mazda had
deluded into loving their own countries only in order that they should
not invade Persia. The Persians, says Herodotus, “esteem themselves to
be far the most excellent of men in every respect”; t hey believe that
other nations approach to excellence according to their geographical
proximity to Persia, “but that they are the worst who live farthest from
them.”” The words have a</p></li>

wicked.” Inspired works are seldom consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Zarathustra, had he been immortal, would have been scandalized to
find statues of Anaita, the Persian Aphrodite, set up in many cities of
the empire within a few centuries after his death. 61 And surely it
would not have pleased him to find so many pages of his revelation
devoted to magic formulas for healing, divination and sorcery. 66 After
his death the old priesthood of “Wise Men” or Magi conquered him as
priesthoods conquer in the end every vigorous rebel or heretic — by
adopting and absorbing him into their theology; they numbered him among
the Magi and forgot him. 6</p></li>

Parysatis, poisoned her out of jealousy, encouraged the king to marry
his own daughter Atossa, played dice with him for the life of a eunuch,

necks and ears and arms. Pearls, rubies, emeralds and lapis lazuli came
from abroad, but turquoise came from the Persian mines, and contributed
the customary material for the aristocrat’s signet -ring. Gems of

roomy antechambers, an area of more than a hundred thousand square feet
— vaster, if size mattered, than vast Kamak, or any European cathedral
except Milan’s. 138 Another flight of steps led to this Great Hall;
these stairs were flanked with ornamental parapets, and their supporting
sides were carved with the finest bas-reliefs yet discovered in Persia.

Granicus; the Greeks lost 115 men, the Persians 2 0,000. 111 Alexander
marched south and east, taking cities and receiving surrenders for a
year. Meanwhile Darius III gathered a horde of 600,000 soldiers and
adventurers; five days were required to march them over a bridge of
boats across the Euphrates; six hundred mules and three hundred camels
were needed to carry the royal purse. 116 When the two armies met at
Issus Alexander had no more than 30,000 followers; but Darius, with all
the stupidity that destiny could require, had chosen a field in which
only a small part of his multitude could fight at one time. When the
slaughter was over the Macedonians had lost some 450, the Persians 1
10,000 men, most of these being slain in wild retreat; Alexander, in
reckless pursuit, crossed a stream on a bridge of Persian corpses. 116
Darius fled ignominiously, abandoning his mother, a wife, two daughters,
his chariot, and his luxuriously appointed tent. Alexander treated the
Persian ladies with a chivalry that surprised the Greek historians,
contenting himself with marrying one of the daughters. If we may believe
Quintus Curtius, the mother of Darius became so fond of Alexander that
after his death she put an end to her own life by volun- tary
starvation. 117</p></li>
<li><p>“All those that were in Asia,” says Josephus, “were persuaded
that the Macedonians</p></li>
<li><p>for the safe return of his mother, his wife and his children,
would offer him his daughter in marriage, and would acknowl- edge his
sovereignty over all Asia west of the Euphrates, if only Alexander would
end the war and become his friend. Parmenio, second in command among the
Greeks, said that if he were Alexander he would be glad to accept such
happy terms, and avoid with honor the hazard of some disas- trous
defeat. Alexander remarked that he would do likewise — if he were
Parmenio. Being Alexander, he answered Darius that his offer meant
nothing, since he, Alexander, already possessed such parts of Asia as
Darius proposed to cede to him, and could marry the daughter of the
emperor when he pleased. Darius, despairing of peace with so reckless a
logician, turned unwillingly to the task of collecting another and
larger force.</p></li>
<li><p>and by superior weapons, generalship and courage de- stroyed it
in a day. Darius again chose the better part of valor, but his generals,
disgusted with this second flight, murdered him in his tent. Alexander
put to death such of the assassins as he could find, sent the body of
Darius in state to Persepolis, and ordered it to be buried in the manner
of the Achaemenid kings. The Persian people flocked readily to the
standard of the conquerer, charmed by his generosity and his youth.

the spoken lan - guage of the Aryan invaders. What that speech was we do
not know; we can only presume that it was a near relative of the early
Persian dialect in which the Avesta was composed. The Sanskrit of the
Vedas and the epics has already the earmarks of a classic and literary
tongue, used only by scholars and priests; the very word Sanskrit means

in Persia. Such a simultaneity of genius suggests more intercom-

Scriptures, in a passage sacred to all followers of</p></li>
<li><p>His mother had died in giving him birth.</p></li>
<li><p>and remained there steadfast and motionless, resolving never to
leave that seat until enlightenment came to him. What, he asked himself,
was the source of human sorrow, suffering, sickness, old age and death?
Suddenly a vision came to him of the infinite succes- sion of deaths and
births in the stream of life: he saw every death frus- trated with new
birth, every peace and joy balanced with new desire and discontent, new
disappointment, new grief and pain. “Thus, with mind concentrated,
purified, cleansed, … I directed my mind to the pass- ing away and
rebirth of beings. With divine, purified, superhuman vision I saw beings
passing away and being reborn, low and high, of good and bad color, in
happy or miserable existences, according to their karma”— according to
that universal law by which every act of good or of evil will be
rewarded or punished in this life, or in some later incarnation of the
soul.</p></li>

point.</p></li>
<li><p>The oldest extant documents purporting to be the teaching of
Buddha are the Pitakas, or “Baskets of the Law,” prepared for the
Buddhist Council of 241 b.c., accepted by it as genuine, transmitted
orally for four centuries from the death of Buddha, and finally put into
writing, in the Pali tongue, about 80 b.c. These Pitakas are divided
into three groups: the Sutta, or tales; the Vinaya , or discipline; and
the Abhidhamma, or doctrine. The Sutta-pitaka contains the dialogues of
Buddha, which Rhys Davids ranks with those of Plato. 84 Strictly
speaking, however, these writings give us the teaching not necessarily
of Buddha himself, but only of the Buddhist schools. “Though these
narratives,” says Sir Charles Elliot, “are compilations which accepted
new matter during several centuries, I see no reason to doubt that the
oldest stratum contains the recollections of those who had seen and
heard the master.” 88</p></li>

scorns their as - sumption that the Vedas were inspired by the gods , 62
and he scandalizes the caste-proud Brahmans by accepting into his order
the members of any caste. He does not explicitly condemn the
caste-system, but he tells his disciples, plainly enough: “Go into all
lands and preach this gospel. Tell them that the poor and the lowly, the
rich and the high, are all one, and th at all castes unite in this
religion as do the rivers in the sea .” 58 He de - nounces the notion of
sacrificing to the gods, and looks with horror upon the slaughter of
animals for these rites ; 54 he rejects all cult and worship of</p></li>
<li><p>He does not go out of his way to deny deity, and occasionally he
speaks as if Brahma were a reality rather than an ideal ; 66 nor does he
forbid the popular worship of the gods . 66 But he smiles at the notion
of sending up prayers to the Unknowable; “it is foolish,” he says, “to
suppose that another can cause us happiness or misery” 60 — these are
always the product of our own behavior and our own desires. He refuses
to rest his moral code upon supernatural sanctions of any kind; he
offers no heaven, no purgatory, and no hell . 61 He is too sensitive to
the suffering and killing involved in the biological process to suppose
that they have been consciously willed by a personal divinity; these
cosmic blunders, he thinks, outweigh the evidences of design.“ In this
scene of order and confusion, of good and evil, he finds no principle of

periods of literary and artistic — above all, architectural-creation;
there were wealthy capitals, luxurious palaces, and mighty potentates;

men who for a</p></li>
<li><p>Dynasty, was a man every whit as brave and fascinating as Alex-
ander. Descended from both Timur and Genghis Khan, he inherited all the
ability of these scourges of Asia without their brutality. He suffered
from a surplus of energy in body and mind; he fought, hunted and
traveled insatiably; it was nothing for him, single-handed, to kill five
enemies in five minutes.“ In two days he rode one hundred and sixty
miles on horse- back, and swam the Ganges twice in the bargain; and in
his last years he remarked that not since the age of eleven had he kept
the fast of Ramadan twice in the same place . 88</p></li>
<li><p>Mogul is another form of Mongol. The Moguls were really Turks;
but the Hindus called — and still call — all northern Moslems (except
the Afghans) Moguls . 85 “Babur” was a Mongol nickname, meaning lion;

unable to read — listened for hours while others read to him, often from
abstruse and difficult volumes. In the end he became an illiterate
scholar, loving letters and art, and supporting them with royal
largesse.</p></li>
<li><p>Bribery and embezzlement throve among these governors and their
subordinates, so that much of Akbar’s time was spent in checking
corruption. He regulated with strict economy the expenses of his court
and household, fixing the prices of food and materials bought for them,
and the wages of labor engaged by the state. When he died he left the
equivalent of a billion dollars in the treasury, and his empire was the
most powerful on earth.“</p></li>
<li><p>The army was supplied with the best ordnance yet seen in India,
but inferior to that then in use in Europe. Akbar’s efforts to secure
better guns failed; and this inferiority in the instruments of slaughter
cooperated with the degeneration of his descendants in de- termining the
European conquest of India.</p></li>
<li><p>He had a harem suitable to the size of his em- pire; one gossip
tells us th at “the King hath in Agra and Fathpur -Sikri, as they do
credibly report, one thousand elephants, thirty thousand horses,
fourteen hundred tame deer, eight hundred concubines.” But he does not
seem to have had sensual ambitions or tastes. He married widely, but
politically; he pleased the Rajput princes by espousing their daughters,
and thereby bound them to the support of his throne; and from that time
the Mogul Dynasty was half native in blood. A Rajput became his lead-
ing general, and a raja rose to be his greatest minister. His dream was
a united India . 01</p></li>

the language of his court — the masterpieces of Hindu literature,
history and science, and himself supervised the translation of the

and stimulation. Hindu music and poetry had now one of their greatest
periods; and painting, both Persian and Hindu, reached its second zenith

course, was “King of the World.” fThis throne, which required seven
years for its completion, consisted entirely of jewels, precious metals
and stones. Four legs of gold supported the seat; twelve pillars made of
emeralds held up the enameled canopy; each pillar bore two peacocks
encrusted with gems; and between each pair of peacocks rose a tree
covered with diamonds, emer- alds, rubies and pearls. The total cost was
over ,000,000. The throne was captured and carried off to Persia by
Nadir Shah (1739), and was gradually dismembered to defray the expenses
of Persian royalty. 114</p></li>

<li><p>The following analysis will apply for the most part to post-Vedic
and pre-British India. The reader should remember that India is now in
flux, and that institutions, morals and manners once characteristic of
her may be disappearing today.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the gold used in the Persian Empire in the fifth century
before Christ came from India. Silver, copper, lead, tin, zinc and iron
were also mined — iron as early as 1500 b.c. u The art of tempering and
casting iron developed in India long before its known appearance in
Europe; Vikramaditya, for example, erected at Delhi (ca. 380 a.d.) an
iron pillar that stands untarnished today after fifteen cen- turies; and
the quality of metal, or manner of treatment, which has pre- served it
from rust or decay is still a mystery to modem metallurgical science. 12
Before the European invasion the smelting of iron in small char- coal
furnaces was one of the major industries of India. 13 The Industrial
Revolution taught Europe how to carry out these processes more cheaply
on a larger scale, and the Indian industry died under the competition.
Only in our own time are the rich mineral resources of India being again
exploited and explored. 14</p></li>
<li><p>We do not know what these “ants” were; they were more probably
anteaters than ants.</p></li>
<li><p>But weaving was only one of the many handi- crafts of India, and
the weavers were only one of the many craft and merchant guilds that
organized and regulated the industry of India. Europe looked upon the
Hindus as experts in almost every line of manufacture — wood-work,
ivory-work, metal-work, bleaching, dyeing, tanning, soap-mak- ing,
glass-blowing, gunpowder, fireworks, cement, etc. 21 China imported
eyeglasses from India in 1260 a.d. Bernier, traveling in India in the
seven- teenth century, described it as humming with industry. Fitch, in
1585, saw a fleet of one hundred and eighty boats carrying a great
variety of goods down the river Jumna.</p></li>

the story:</p></li>
<li><p>a severe application of the lex talionis, and an untiring
inculcation of the virtues, rights and powers of the Brahman caste. 03
Its effect was to strengthen enormously the hold of the caste system
upon Hindu society.</p></li>
<li><p>Pere Dubois, who, though unsympathetic to India, is usually
truthful, gives us a pic- ture of the ordeals used in his time (1820).
“There are,” he says, “several other kinds of trial by ordeal. Amongst
the number is that of boiling oil which is mixed with cow-dung, and into
which the accused must plunge his arm up to the elbow; and that of the
snake, which consists in shutting up some very poisonous snake in a
basket in which has been placed a ring or a piece of money which the
accused must find and bring out with his eyes bandaged; if in the former
case he is not scalded, and in the latter case is not bitten, his
innocence is comp letely proved.” 82</p></li>
<li><p>but when, under the influence of European individualism, wills
were introduced, they were greatly favored by the Brahmans, as an
occasional means of securing property for ecc lesiastical purposes.’ 0
The most important element in any sacrifice to the gods was the fee paid
to the ministrant priest; the highest summit of piety was largesse in
such fees. 71 Miracles and a thousand superstitions were another fertile
source of sacerdotal wealth. For a consideration a Brahman might render
a bar- ren woman fecund; oracles were manipulated for financial ends;
men were engaged to feign madness and to confess that their fate was a
punish- ment for parsimony to the priests. In every illness, lawsuit,
bad omen, unpleasant dream or new enterprise the advice of a Brahman was
desir- able, and the adviser was worthy of his hire.”</p></li>
<li><p>Even if a Brahman committed every crime, he was not to be killed;
the king might exile him, but must allow him to keep his property.” He
who tried to strike a Brahman would suffer in hell for a hundred years;
he who actually struck a Brahman would suffer in hell for a thousand
years . 85 If a Shudra debauched the wi fe of a Brahman, the Shudra’s
property was to be confiscated, and his genitals were to be cut off . 85

should it be postponed, as in America, until the male arrives at
economic maturity? The first solution apparently weakens the na- tional
physique , 110 unduly accelerates the growth of population, and sac-
rifices the woman almost completely to reproduction; the second solution
leaves the problems of unnatural delay, sexual frustration,
prostitution, and venereal disease. The Hindus chose child marriage as
the lesser evil, and tried to mitigate its dangers by establishing,
between the marriage and its consummation, a period in which the bride
should remain with her parents until the coming of puberty . 111 The
institution was old, and therefore holy; it had been rooted in the
desire to prevent intercaste mar- riage through casual sexual attraction
; 113 it was later encouraged by the fact that the conquering and
otherwise ruthless Moslems were restrained</p></li>

conversation in homes where the married women were neither encouraged to
read nor allowed to mingle with guests. In 1004 a.d., as a sacred
inscription informs us, the temple of the Chola King Rajaraja at Tanjore
had four hundred devadasis. The custom</p></li>
<li><p>Strabo (ca. 20 a.d.) , relying on Aristobulus, describes “some
novel and unusual cus - toms at Taxila: those who by reason of poverty
are unable to marry off their daughters, lead them forth to the market
place in the power of their age to the sound of both trumpets and drums
(precisely the instruments used to signal the call to battle), thus
assembling a crowd; and to any man who comes forward they first expose
her rear parts up to the shoulders, and then her front parts, and if she
pleases him, and at the same time allows herself to be persuaded, on
approved terms, he marries her .” 128 t Among the Rajputs, if we may
believe Tod, it was usual for the prince to have different wives for
each day of the week . 135</p></li>

<li><p>Megasthenes reported, in Chandragupta’s days, that “the Brahmans
keep their wives— and they have many wives — ignorant of all philosophy;
for if women learned to look upon pleasure and pain, life and death,
philosophically, they would become depraved, or else no longer remain in
subjection .” 141</p></li>

survive her husband, but enters proudly into the lire . 122 The
sacrifice was effected by burning the wife in a pit, or, among the
Telugus in the south, by burying her alive . 151 Strabo reports that
suttee prevailed in India in the time of Alexander, and that the
Kathaei, a Punjab tribe, had made suttee a law in order to prevent wives
from poisoning their husbands . 125 Manu makes no mention of the
practice. The Brahmans opposed it at first, then accepted it, and
finally lent it a religious sanc- tion by interpreting it as bound up
with the eternity of marriage: a woman once married to a man remained
his forever, and would be rejoined to him in his later lives . 155 In
Rajasthan the absolute possession of the wife by the husband took the
form of the johur, in which a Rajput, fac- ing certain defeat, immolated
his wives before advancing to his own death in battle . 157 The usage
was widespread under the Moguls, despite Moslem abhorrence; and even the
powerful Akbar failed to dislodge it. On one occasion Akbar himself

the degraded condition of the Hindu female, in which sentiment he would
find her little disposed to join him .” 163 On contemporary change s in
these customs cf. Chapter XXII below.</p></li>
<li><p>A great Hindu, Lajpat Rai, reminded Europe that “long before the
European nations knew anything of hygiene, and long before they realized
the value of tooth-brush and a daily bath, the Hindus were, as a rule,
given to both. Only twenty years ago London houses had no bath-tubs, and
the tooth- brush was a luxury .” 171</p></li>
<li><p>Chess is so old that half the nations of antiquity claim its
birthplace. The view gen- erally accepted by archeologists of the game
is that it arose in India; certainly we find there its oldest
indisputable appearance (ca. 750 a.d.). The word chess comes from the
Persian shah , king; and checkmate is originally shah-mat- “  ting
dead.” The Persians called it shatranj , and took both the word and the
game, through the Arabs, from India, where it was known as chaturanga,
or “four angles”— elephants, horses, chariots and foot- soldiers. The
Arabs still call the bishop al-fil- i.e., elephant (from aleph-hind,
Arabic for “ox of India”). 3500</p></li>

<li><p>The Hindus believe in seven heavens, one of them on earth, the
others rising in gradations above it; there are twenty-one hells,
divided into seven sections. Punishment is not eternal, but it is
diversified. Pere Dubois’ description of the Hindu hells rivals Dante’s
account of Inferno, and illustrates, like it, the many fears, and the
sadistic imagination, of mank ind. “Fire, steel, serpents, venomous
insects, savage beasts, birds of prey, gall, poison, stenches; in a
word, everything possible is employed to torment the damned. Some have a
cord run through their nostrils, by which they are forever dragged over
the edges of extremely sharp knives; others are condemned to pass
through the eye of a needle; others are placed between two flat rocks,
which meet, and crush, without killing, them; others have their eyes
pecked incessantly by famished vultures; while millions of them continu-

its first known appearance in India; but by general con- sent the Arabs

<li><p>but our adoption of its Arabic name ( al-jabr , adjustment) in-
dicates that it came to western Europe from the Arabs — i.e., from India
— rather than from Greece. 1 “ The great Hindu leaders in this field, as
in as- tronomy, were Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and Bhaskara. The last (b.
1114 a.d.), appears to have invented the radical sign, and many
algebraic symbols. 13 These men created the conception of a negative
quantity, without which algebra would have been impossible; 13 they
formulated rules for finding permutations and combinations; they found
the square root of 2, and solved, in the eighth century a.d.,
indeterminate equations of the second degree that were unknown to Europe
until the days of Euler a thousand years later. 14 They expressed their
science in poetic form, and gave to mathematical prob- lems a grace
characteristic of India’s Golden Age. These two may serve as examples of
simpler Hindu algebra:</p></li>
<li><p>The first algebraist known to us, the Greek Diophantus (360
a.d.), antedates Aryab- hata by a century; but Cajori believes that he
took his lead from India. 11</p></li>
<li><p>and the “Pythagorean Law” was formulated by which the number of
vi - brations, and therefore the pitch of the note, varies inversely as
the length of the string between the point of attachment and the point
of touch.</p></li>
<li><p>1</p></li>
<li><p>E.g., in The Ocean of Music ( Samgita-ratnakara ) of Sharamgadeva
(1210-47).</p></li>
<li><p>8 In the time of Yuan Chwang Hindu medical treatment began with a
seven-day fast; in this interval the patient often recovered; if the
illness continued, drugs were at last employed.“ Even then drugs were
used very sparingly; reliance was placed largely upon diet, baths,
enemas, inhalations, urethral and vaginal injections, and blood-lettings
by leeches or cups.</p></li>
<li><p>Hindu physicians were especially skilled in concocting anti-
dotes for poisons; they still excel European physicians in curing snake-
bites.“ Vaccination, unknown to Europe before the eighteenth
century,</p></li>
<li><p>We have already studied the Nastika systems, which were chiefly
those of the Charvakas, the Buddhists, and the Jains. But, strange to
say, these systems were called Nastika, heterodox and nihilist, not
because they questioned or denied the existence of God (which they did),
but because they questioned, denied or ignored the authority of the
Vedas. Many of the Astika systems also doubted or denied God; they were
nevertheless called orthodox because they accepted the infallibility of
the Scriptures, and the institution of caste; and no hindrance was
placed against the free thought, however atheistic, of those schools
that acknowledged these fundamentals of orthodox Hindu society. Since a
wide latitude was al- lowed in interpreting the holy books, and clever
dialecticians could find in the Vedas any doctrine which they sought,
the only practical require- ment for intellectual respectability was the
recognition of caste; this being the real government of India, rejection
of it was treason, and acceptance of it covered a multitude of sins. In
effect, therefore, the philosophers of India enjoyed far more liberty
than their Scholastic analogues in Europe,</p></li>
<li><p>like another James or Dewey he looks upon knowledge and thought
as pragmatic tools and organs of human need and will, to be tested by
their ability to lead to successful ac- tion.“ He is a realist, and will
have nothing to do with the sublime idea that the world ceases to exist
when no one takes the precaution to perceive it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Nyaya syllogism, however, has five propositions: theorem,
reason, major premiss, minor premiss and conclusion. E.g.: (i) Socrates
is mortal, (2) for he is a man; (3) all men are mortal; (4) Socrates is
a man; (j) therefore Socrates is mortal.</p></li>
<li><p>Of</p></li>
<li><p>Its earliest extant literature, the Sankhya-karika of the
commentator Ishvara Krishna, dates back only to the fifth century a.d.,
and the Sankhya-sutras once attributed to Kapila are not older than our
fifteenth century; but the origins of the system apparently antedate
Buddhism itself . 70 The Buddhist texts and the Mahabharatd 70a
repeatedly refer to it, and Winternitz finds its influence in Pythagoras
. 705</p></li>
<li><p>“The evolution of Prakriti” says one Hindu commentator on Kapila,
“has no purpose except to provide a spectacle for the soul .” 80
Perhaps, as Nietzsche suggested, the wisest way to view the world is as
an esthetic and dramatic spectacle.</p></li>
<li><p>and the Tantras — which transform Purusha and Prakriti into the
male and female principles of creation ; 88 above all in the system of
Yoga, which is merely a practical development of Sankhya, built upon its
theories and couched in its phrases. Kapila has few explicit adherents
today, since Shankara and the Vedanta have captured the Hindu mind; but
an old proverb still raises its voice occasionally in India: “There is
no knowledge equal to the Sankhya, and no power equal to the
Yoga.”</p></li>
<li><p>Cf . the poem quoted on page 512 above.</p></li>
<li><p>The fixation of any one object long enough will free the soul of
all sensa- tion, all specific thought, and all selfish desire; then the
mind, abstracted from things, will be left free to feel the immaterial
essence of reality.t</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. Hobbes: Semper idem sentire idem est ac nihil sentire:
“always to feel the same thing is the same as to feel nothing.”</p></li>
<li><p>Asceticism is the reciprocal of sensuality, or at best an attempt
to control it; but the attempt itself verges upon a masochistic
sensuality in which the ascetic takes an almost erotic delight in his
pain. The Brahmans have wisely abstained from such practices, and have
coun- seled their followers to seek sanctity through the conscientious
perform- ance of the normal duties of life. 1 ”</p></li>
<li><p>The blunt Dubois describes them as “a tribe of vagabonds .” 109
The word fakir, some - times applied to Yogis, is an Arab term,
originally meaning “poor,” and properly applied only to members of
Moslem religious orders vowed to poverty.</p></li>

<li><p>he will adore, as the Supreme Being, Being itself —
indescribable, limitless, spaceless, time- less, causeless, changeless
Being, the source and substance of all reality, f We may apply the
adjectives “conscious,” “intelligent,” even “happy” to Brahman , since
Brahman includes all selves, and these may have such qual- ities ; 116
but all other adjectives would be applicable to Brahman equally, since
It includes all qualities of all things. Essentially Brahman is neuter,
raised above personality and gender, beyond good and evil, above all
moral distinctions, all differences and attributes, all desires and
ends. Brahman is the cause and effect, the timeless and secret essence,
of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Hence the name Advaita — non-dualism — often given to the Vedanta
philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>To find this blissful peace ( Ananda ) a man must renounce not
merely the world but himself; he must care nothing for possessions or
goods, even for good or evil; he must look upon suffering and death as
Maya, surface incidents of body and matter, time and change; and he must
not think of his own personal quality and fate; a single moment of
self-interest or pride can destroy all his liberation. 1 “ Good works
cannot give a man salvation, for good works have no validity or meaning
except in the Maya world of space and time; only the knowl- edge of the
saintly seer can bring that salvation which is the recognition of the
identity of self and the universe, Atman and Brahman, soul and God, and
the absorption of the part in the whole . 120 Only when this absorption
is complete does the wheel of reincarnation stop; for then it is seen
that the separate self and personality, to which reincarnation comes, is
an illu- sion .“ 1 It is Ishvara, the Maya god, that gives rebirth to
the self in punish- ment and reward; but “when the identity” of Atman
and Brahman “has become known, then,” says Shankara, “the soul’s
existence as wanderer, and Brahman’s existence as creator” (i.e., as
Ishvara) “have vanished away .”“ 2 Ishvara and Karma, like things and
selves, belong to the exot eric doctrine of Vedanta as adapted to the
needs of the common man; in the esoteric or secret doctrine soul and
Brahman are one, never wandering, never dying, never changed .“

<li><p>Cf. Blake:</p></li>
<li><p>and all our eigh- teenth-century rationalism appears to the
Indian metaphysician as a vain and superficial attempt to subject the
incalculable universe to the concepts of a salonnikre. “Into blind
darkness pass they who worship ignorance; into still greater darkness
the y who are content with knowledge.” 128 Hindu philosophy begins where
European philosophy ends — with an inquiry into the nature of knowledge
and the limitations of reason; it starts not with the physics of Thales
and Democritus, but with the epistemology of Locke and Kant; it takes
mind as that which is most immediately known, and therefore refuses to
resolve it into a matter known only mediately and through mind. It
accepts an external world, but does not believe that our senses can ever
know it as it is. All science is a charted ignorance, and belongs to
Maya ; it formulates, in ever changing concepts and phrases, the
rationale of a world in which reason is but a part — one shifting
current in</p></li>

creatures, has no disquiet thence. What delusion, what grief can he with

<li><p>while the East borrows more and more from the science of the
West. Another world war might leave Europe open again (as the break-up
of Alexander’s empire opened Greece, and the fall of the Roman Republic
opened Rome) — to an influx of Oriental philosophies and faiths. The
mounting insurrection of the Orient against the Occident, the loss of
those Asiatic markets that have sustained the industry and prosperity of
the West, the weakening of Europe by poverty, faction and revolution,
might make that divided continent ripe for a new religion of celestial
hope and earthly despair. Probably it is prejudice that makes such a
denouement seem inconceivable in America: quietism and resignation do
not comport with our electric atmosphere, or with the vitality born of
rich resources and a spacious terrain. Doubtless our weather will
protect us in the end.</p></li>

<li><p>One of the earliest and greatest was Bhartrihari, monk,
grammarian and lover, who, before retiring into the arms of religion,
instructed his soul with amours. He has left us a record of them in his
“Century of Love”— a Heine- like sequence of a hundred poems.
“Erstwhile,” he writes to one of his loves, “we twain deemed that thou
wast I and I was thou; how comes it now that thou are thou and I am I?”
He did not care for reviewers, and told them: “It is easy to satisfy one
who is ignorant, even easier to satisfy a connoisseur; but not the
Creator himself can please the man who has just a morsel of knowledge.”
63 In Jayadeva’s Gita - Govinda , or “Song of the Divine Cowherd,” the
amorousness of the Hindu turns to religion, and in - tones the sensuous
love of Radha and Krishna. It is a poem of full-bodied passion, but
India interprets it reverently as a mystic and symbolic por- trayal of
the soul’s lon ging for God — an interpretation that would be intelligi-
ble to those immovable divines who composed such pious headings for the
Song of Songs .</p></li>

<li><p>Poetry tended now to be less objective than in the days of the
epic, and gave itself more and more to the interweaving of religion and
love. Metre, which had been loose and free in the epics, varying in the
length of the line, and requiring regularity only in the last four or
five syllables, became at once stricter and more varied; a thousand com-
plications of prosody were introduced, which disappear in translation;
artifices of letter and phrase abounded, and rhyme appeared not only at
the end but often in the middle of the line. Rigid rules were composed
for the poetic art, and the form became more pre- cise as the content
thinned.</p></li>

musician constantly returns. Each raga is named from the mood that it
wishes to sug- gest — “Dawn,” “Spring,” “Evening Beauty,”
“Intoxication,” etc. — and is as- sociated with a specific time of the
day or the year. Hindu legend ascribes an occult power to these ragas;
so it is said that a Bengal dancing-girl ended a drought by singing, as
a kind of “Rain - drop Prelude,” the Megh mallar raga, or rain-making
theme . 13 Their antiquity has given the ragas a sacred character; he
who plays them must observe them faithfully, as forms enacted by Shiva
himself. One player, Narada, having performed them carelessly, was
ushered into hell by Vishnu, and was shown men and women weeping over
their broken limbs; these, said the god, were the ragas and raginis dis-
torted and torn by Narada’s reckless playing. Seeing which, we are told,
Narada sought more humbly a greater perfection in his art . 14</p></li>

Leonardo. These temples were carved out of the rocky face of a
mountain-side at various periods from the first to the seventh century
a.d. For centuries they were lost to history and human memory after the
decay of Buddhism; the jungle grew about them and almost buried them;
bats, snakes and other beasts made their home there, and a thousand
varieties of birds and insects fouled the paintings with their waste. In
1819 Europeans stumbled into the ruins, and were amazed to find on the
walls frescoes that are now ranked among the masterpieces of the world’s

to Hinduism, even to the ter- rible Kali whose priest he became, and
whom he transformed into a Mother-Goddess overflowing with tenderness

Bhakti-yoga — the discipline and union of love. “The knowledge of God,”
he said, “may be likened to a man, while love of God is like a woman.
Knowledge has entry only to the outer rooms of God, and no one can enter
into the inner mysteries of God save a lover .” 18 Unlike Ram Mohun Roy,

that they are too consistently beautiful, too monotonously idealistic
and tender. Every woman in them is lovely, and every man in them is
infatuated with woman, or death, or God; nature, though some- times
terrible, is always sublime, never bleak, or barren, or hideous, f
Perhaps the story of Ch itra is Tagore’s story: her lover Arjuna tires
of her in a year because she is completely and uninterruptedly
beautiful; only when she loses her beauty and, becoming strong, takes up
the natural labors of life, does the god love her again — a profound
symbol of the contented marriage . 28 Tagore confesses his limitations

180,000 employees, and an average wage-scale of thirty-three cents a

are children under fourteen. 85</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore the laws of caste forbid an Untouchable to approach
nearer than twenty-four feet to a Shudra, or seventy-four feet to a
Brahman; 40 if the shadow of a Pariah falls upon a man of caste, the
latter must remove the contamination by a purifying ablution. Whatever
the Outcaste touches is thereby defiled, f In many parts of India he
must not draw water from the public wells, or enter temples used by
Brahmans, or send his children to the Hindu schools. 42 The British,
whose policies have in some degree contributed to the impoverishment of
the Outcastes, have brought them at least equality before the law, and
equal access to all British-controlled colleges and schools. The
Nationalist movement, under the inspiration of Gandhi, has done much to
lessen the disabilities of the Untouchables. Perhaps another generation
will see them externally and superficially free.</p></li>

<li><p>Like most other peopl es of the earth, “the Chinese consider
themselves the most polished and civilized of all nations.” 7 Perhaps
they are right, despite their political corruption and chaos, their
backward science and sweated industry, their odorous cities and
offal-strewn fields, their floods and famines, their apathy and cruelty,
their poverty and superstition, their reckless breeding and suicidal
wars, their slaughters and ignominious de- feats. For behind this dark
surface that now appears to the alien eye is one of the oldest and
richest of living civilizations: a tradition of poetry reaching as far
back as 1700 b.c.; a long record of philosophy idealistic and yet
practical, profound and yet intelligible; a mastery of ceramics and
painting unequaled in their kind; an easy perfection, rivaled only by
the Japanese, in all the minor arts; the most effective morality to be
found among the peoples of any time; a social organization that has held
together more human beings, and has endured through more centuries, than
any other known to history; a form of government which, until the
Revolu- tion destroyed it, was almost the ideal of philosophers; a
society that was civilized when Greece was inhabited by barbarians, that
saw the rise and fall of Babylonia and Assyria, Persia and Judea, Athens
and Rome, Venice and Spain, and may yet survive when those Balkans
called Europe have reverted to darkness and savagery. What is the secret
of this durability of government, this artistry of hand, this poise and
depth of soul?</p></li>
<li><p>The Chinese scholar who helped Dr. Giles to translate some of the
extracts in Gems of Chinese Literature , sent him, as a well-meant
farewell, a poem in which occurred these gracious lines:</p></li>
<li><p>Chinese civilization began, driving back the beast and the
jungle, holding the surrounding barbarians at bay, clearing the soil of
brush and bramble, ridding it of destructive insects and corrosive
deposits like saltpetre, draining the marshes, fighting droughts and
floods and devastating changes in the courses of the rivers, drawing the
water</p></li>

<li><p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p></li>
<li><p>During his long ministry Ts’i became a well-ordered state, with a
stabilized currency, an efficient admin- istration, and a flourishing
culture. Confucius, who praised politicians only by epitaph, said of
Kuan: “Down to the present day the people enjoy the gifts which he
conferred. But for Kuan Chung we should now be wear- ing our hair
disheveled, and the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left
side.”</p></li>
<li><p>This is Confucius</p></li>
<li><p>But all are agreed that the T ao-T e-Ching — i.e., the “Book of
the Way and of Vir - tue”— is the most important text of that Taoist
philosophy which, in the opinion of Chinese students, existed long
before Lao-tze, found many first- rate defenders after him, and became
the religion of a considerable minority of the Chinese from his time to
our own. The authorship of the Tao-Te- Ching is a secondary matter; but
its ideas are among the most fascinating in the history of
thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Professor Giles considers it a forgery composed after 200 b.c. by
free pilfering from the works of the essayist and cri tic, Han Fei;“
Dr. Legge holds that the frequent refer - ences to Lao (as “Lao Tan”) in
Chuang - tze and in Szuma Ch’ien warrant continued belief in the
authenticity of the T ao-T e- Ching.™</p></li>

scholar of the first century a.d., attributed the work to K’ung Chi,
grandson of Confucius; the sceptical scholars of today agree that the

<li><p>“The Higher Man moves so as to make his movements in all
generations a universal path; he behaves so as to make his conduct in
all generations a universal law; he speaks so as to make his words in

Golden Rule, which is here laid down explicitly four centuries before
Hillel and five centuries before Christ: “Chung -kung asked about
perfect virtue. The Master said, . . . ‘Not to do unto others as you
would not wish done unto yourself.’ ,ma The principle is stated again
and again, always negatively, and once in a single word. “Tsze -kung
asked, ‘Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all
one’s life?’ The Master said, ‘Is not reciprocity such a word ?’” 123
Nevertheless he did not wish, like Lao-tze, to return good for evil; and
when one of his pupils asked him, “What do you say concerning the
principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?” he replied,
more sharply than was his custom: “With what, then, will you recomp ense
kindness? Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with
kindness .” 124</p></li>

Con- fucius, and passed them on by word of mouth to equal memories. Soon
after the Emperor’s death these volumes were freely circulated again,
though many errors, presumably, had crept into their texts. The only
permanent result was to lend an aroma of sanctity to the proscribed

Emperor Wu had had some kindred spirit, he might have been able to
profit by this and create, in a new order of society, the Chinese State.

have thought of using varied expedients from day to day — rejected when
they had yielded sufficient to appear worn out — and new men —
sacrificed as soon as they had succeeded well enough to assume a
dangerous air of authority. The restlessness of the despot and the short
vision of the imperial law-makers made China miss the rarest opportunity

dated, therefore, about 150 a.d., only half a century after Ts’ai Lun’s
report of his invention. 7 These early papers were of pure rag,
essentially like the paper used in our own day when durability is
desired. The Chinese developed paper al most to perfection by using a
“sizing” of glue or gelatin, and a base of starchy paste, to strengthen
the fibres and accelerate their absorption of ink. When the art was
taught by the Chinese to the Arabs in the eighth century, and by the
Arabs to Europe in the thirteenth, it was already complete.</p>

states should be based upon the proper reg- ulation of the family, that
the regulation of the family should be based upon the regulation of
one’s self, that the regulation of one’s self depended</p></li>

which in turn derives from the Latin lac . milk.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the Sung the art reached its height, if not of excellence,
certainly of fer- tility; cauldrons, wine vessels, beakers, censers,
weapons, mirrors, bells, drums, vases, plaques and figurines filled the
shelves of connoisseurs and found some place in nearly every home. An
attractive sample of Sung work is an in- cense burner in the form of a
water buffalo mounted by Lao-tze, who be- strides it calmly in proof of
the power of philosophy to tame the savage breast . 40 The casting is
throughout of the thinness of paper, and the lapse of time has given the
piece a patina or coating of mottled green that lends it the
meretricious beauty of decay.t Under the Ming a slow

almost in the process of turning from a god into a goddess. 40</p></li>
<li><p>There are some examples of this style in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.</p></li>
<li><p>Like the Buddhism that inspired them, these graceful edifices
took over some of the superstitions of popular Taoism, and became
centers not only of religious ceremony, but of geoman tic divination —
i.e., the discovery of the future by the study of lines and clefts in
the earth. Communities erected pagodas in the belief that such
structures could ward off wind and flood, propitiate evil spirits, and
attract prosperity. Usually they took the form of octagonal brick towers
rising on a stone foundation to five, seven, nine or thirteen stories,
because even numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Their origin, in name and fact, is in much dispute. The word may
be taken from the Hindu-Persian term but-kadah — “house of idols”; the
form may be indigenous to China, as some think , 54 or may be derived
from the spire that crowned some Hindu topes . 65</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, their greatest achievements were uncon- sciously hidden
from Western travelers. For the Chinese do not flaunt their pictures on
public or private walls; they roll them up and store them carefully
away, and unfold them for occasional enjoyment as we take down and read
a book. Such scroll paintings were arranged in sequence on a roll of
paper or silk, and were “read” like a manuscript; smaller</p></li>
<li><p>He wrote three treatises on painting, of which some fragments
survive. Men, he said, were the most difficult things to paint; next
came landscapes, then horses and gods.’ 2 He insisted on being a
philosopher, too; under his portrait of the emperor he wrote: “In Nature
there is nothing high which is not soon brought low. . . . When the sun
has reached its noon, it begins to sink; when the moon is full it begins
to wane. To rise to glory is as hard as to build a mountain out of
grains of dust; to fall into calamity is as easy as the rebound of a
tense spring.” 78 His contemporaries ranked him as the outstanding man
of his time in three lines: in painting, in wit, and in fool-
ishness.’</p></li>
<li><p>The British Museum assigns to him a faded but lovely scroll of
five pictures illustrat- ing model family life ; 70 the Temple of
Confucius at Chii-fu contains a stone engraving purporting to follow a
design of Ku; and the Freer Gallery at Washington contains two excellent
copies of compositions attributed to him . 71</p></li>
<li><p>a highly cultivated man, who, when he saw it, seemed rather
overcome, and at length said: ‘That pict ure is a copy, made by me in my
youth, of a work from the Imperial Gallery. I lost it twenty years ago
while traveling in the province of Fukien.’ ” Han Yvi at once presented
the miniature to Mr. Chao.</p></li>
<li><p>Only copies remain: chiefly a “Waterfall” in the Temple of
Chisakuin at Kyoto , 79 and a roll (in both the British Museum and the

modest sources, its passage through loess and gorges, its gaping mouth
filled with merchant ships and sampans — has led many students 03 to
rank him at the head of all landscape painters of Orient and Occident;
Ma Yuan, whose delicate landscapes and distant vistas adorn the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts;f Liang K’ai, with his stately portrait of Li Po; Mu
- ch’i, with his terrible tiger, his careless starling, and his morose
but gentle Kuan-yin; and others whose names strike no familiar chords in
Occidental memories, but are the tokens of a mind rich in the heritage
of the East. “The Sung culture,” says Fenollosa, “was the ripest
expression of Chinese genius .” 00</p></li>

<li><p>most part they were drawn for their own sake, because the charm
and mystery of life appeared as completely in them as in a man. The
horse was especially loved, and artists like Han Kan did hardly any-
thing else but paint one form after another of that living embodiment of
artistic line.</p></li>
<li><p>Nature, which is so cruel in China, lavishing death with cold and
flood, was accepted stoically as the supreme god of the Chinese, and
received from them not merely religious sacrifice, but the worship of
their philosophy, their literature and their art. Let it serve as an
indication of the age and depth of culture in China that a thousand
years before Claude Lorraine, Rousseau, Wordsworth and Chateaubriand the
Chinese made nature a passion, and created a school of landscape
painting whose work throughout the Far East became one of the sovereign
expressions of mankind.</p></li>
<li><p>Landscape painting was called simply shan-sui — i.z mountains and
water.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chinese made porcelain out of two minerals chiefly: kaolin —
a pure white clay formed from decomposed felspar of granite, and
pe-tun-tse — a fusible white quartz that gave the product its
translucency. These materials were ground into a powder, worked up into
a paste with water, moulded by hand or on the wheel, and subjected to
high temperatures that fused the composi- tion into a vitreous form,
brilliant and durable. Sometimes the potters, not content with this
simpl e white porcelain, covered the “paste”— i.e., the vessel formed
but not yet fired — with a “glaze” or coating of fine glass, and then
placed the vessel in the kiln; sometimes they applied the glaze after
baking the paste into a “biscuit,” and then placed the vessel over the
fire again. Usually the glaze was colored; but in many cases the paste
was painted in color before applying a transparent glaze, or colors were
painted on the fired glaze and fused upon it by re- firing. These “over
- glaze” colors, wh ich we call enamels, were made of colored glass
ground to powder and reduced to a liquid applicable with the painter’s
slender brush. Life -trained specialists painted the flowers, others the
animals, others the landscapes, others the saints or sages who meditated
among the mountains or rode upon strange beasts over the waves of the
sea.</p></li>
<li><p>When porcelain was introduced into Europe it was named after the
porcellana, or cowrie shell, which in turn derived its name from its
supposed resemblance to the rounded back of a porcella, or little hog .
102</p></li>
<li><p>which it has long been the highest ambition of the modern potter
to produce, and of the collector to acquire.! Specimens of it were sent
to Lorenzo de’ Medici by the Sultan of Egypt in 1487. The Persians and
the Turks valued it not only for its incredibly smooth texture and rich
lustre, but as a detector of poisons; the vessels would change color,
they believed, whenever poisonous substances were placed in them. 1 ®

an empire vaster, of cities more populous, and of a ruler far richer,
than any known to Europe; of stones that were used for heating, of paper
accepted in place of gold, and of nuts larger than a man’s head; of
nations where virginity was an impediment to marriage, and of others
where strangers were entertained by the free use of the host’s willing
daughters and wives. 1 No man would believe them; and the people of Ven-
ice gave to the youngest and most garrulous of them the nickname “Marco
Millions,” because his tale was full of numbers large and marvelous.

<li><p>They had not thought that they would stay in China beyond a year
or two, but they found such lucrative service and commercial
opportunities under Kublai that they remained almost a quarter of a
century. Marco above all prospered, rising even to be governor of
Hangchow. In fond memory he describes it as far ahead of any European
city in the excellence of its building and bridges, the number of its
public hospitals, the ele- gance of its villas, the profusion of
facilities for pleasure and vice, the charm and beauty of its
courtesans, the effective maintenance of public order, and the manners
and refinement of its people. The city, he tells us, was a hundred miles
in circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>he organized a system of state care for aged scholars, orphans
and the infirm; and he patronized munificently education, letters and
the arts. Under him the calendar was revised, and the Imperial Academy
was opened . 9 At Peking he reared a new capital, whose splendor and
popula- tion were the marvel of visitors from other lands. Great palaces
were built, and architecture flourished as never in China
before.</p></li>
<li><p>“Not a day passes,” writes Marco Polo, “in wh ich there are not
distributed, by the regular officers, twenty thousand vessels of rice,
millet, and panicum. By reason of this admirable and astonishing
liberality which the Great Khan exercises towards the poor, the people
all adore him.” 8</p></li>
<li><p>Marco himself, with characteristic obstinacy, lived to the age of
seventy. On his deathbed his friends pleaded with him, for the salvation
of his soul, to retract the obviously dishonest statements that he had
made in his book; but he answered, stoutly: “I have not told half of
what I saw.” Soon after his death a new comic figure became popular at
the Venetian carnivals. He was dressed like a clown, and amused the
populace by his gross exaggerations. His name was Marco Millions. 1

reserve, since a civilization is never quite the same over a long period
of time or an extensive area of space.</p></li>
<li><p>7 The tunic fell variously to the loins, or the knees, or the
feet; it was buttoned closely up to the neck, and had immense sleeves
instead of pockets; China does not say that a man “pocketed” an object,
but that he “sleeved” it. Shirts and underwear were well -nigh un-
known. 28 In the country women wore trousers like the men, since they
were accustomed to doing a man’s work and more; in the towns they
covered the trousers with skirts. In the cities silk was almost as
common as cotton. 20 No belt compressed the waist, and no corsets held
in the breasts. In general the Chinese dress was more sensible, healthy
and convenient than the garb of the modern West. No tyranny of fashion
harassed or exalted the life of the Chinese woman; all urban classes
dressed alike, and nearly all generations; the quality of the garment
might differ, but not the form; and all ranks might be sure that the
fashion would last as long as the gown.</p></li>
<li><p>and a few years of neglect allowed the jungle to return. The
struggle was bitter and perilous; at any moment the bar- barians might
rush in, and seize the slow growths of the cleared earth. Therefore the
peasants, for their protection, lived not in isolated home- steads but
in small communities, surrounded their villages with walls, went out
together to plant and cultivate the soil, and often slept through the
night on guard in their fields.</p></li>
<li><p>The denuded slopes and hills, unable to hold the rain-water that
fell upon them, lost their top-soil, became arid, and offered no
obstacle to the flooding of the valleys by the heavy rains.</p></li>
<li><p>46 The Chinese fed the worms on fresh-cut mulberry leaves, with
startling results: on this diet a pound of (700,000) worms increased in
weight to 9,500 pounds in forty-two days. 47 The adult worms were then
placed in little tents of straw, around which</p></li>
<li><p>The raisers and weavers of silk wore cotton.</p></li>
<li><p>It was not unusual for a Chinese host, when entertaining guests,
to pass delicate fabrics around among them, 48 as another might exhibit
porcelain or unravel his favorite paintings or calligraphic
scrolls.</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy buckets or enormous bundles were balanced on the ends of
poles, and slung over the shoulder. Sometimes dray-carts were drawn by
donkeys, but more often they were pulled by men. Muscle was so cheap
that there was no en- couragement to the development of animal or
mechanical transport; and the primitiveness of transportation offered no
stimulus to the improvement of roads. When European capital built the
first Chinese railway (1876) — a ten-mile line between Shanghai and
Woosung — the people protested that it would disturb and offend the
spirit of the earth; and the opposition grew so vigorous that the
government bought the railroad and heaved its rolling stock into the
sea. 63 In the days of Shih Huang-ti and Kublai Khan im- perial highways
existed, paved with stone; but only their outlines now re- main. The
city streets were mere alleys eight feet wide, designed with a view to
keeping out the sun. Bridges were numerous, and sometimes very
beautiful, like the marble bridge at the Summer Palace. Commerce and
travel used avenues of water almost as frequently as the land; 25,000
miles of canals served as a leisurely substitute for railways; and the
Grand Canal between Hangchow and Tientsin, 650 miles long, begun about
300 a.d. and completed by Kublai Khan was surpassed only by the Great
Wall in the modest list of China’s engineering achievements. “Junks” and
sampans plied the rivers busily, and provided not only cheap
transportation for goods, but homes for millions of the poor.</p></li>
<li><p>When Wu Ti’s experiment with a currency of silver alloyed with
tin was ruined by counterfeiters, the coins were replaced with leather
strips a foot long, which became the foster-parents of paper money.
About the year 807, the supply of copper having, like modern gold,
become inadequate as com- pared with the rising abundance of goods, the
Emperor Hsien Tsung ordered that all copper currency should be deposited
with the govern- ment, and issued in exchange for it certificates of
indebtedness which re- ceived the name of “flying money” from the
Chinese, who appear to have taken their fiscal troubles as
good-naturedly as the Americans of 1933. The practice was discontinued
after the passing of the emergency; but the invention of block-printing
tempted the government to apply the new art to the making of money, and
about 935 a.d. the semi-independent pro- vince of Szechuan, and in 970

Chinese mathematicians apparently derived algebra from India, but
developed geometry for themselves out of their need for measuring the
land. 70 The astronomers of Confucius’ time correctly cal - culated
eclipses, and laid the bases of the Chinese calendar — twelve hours a
day, and twelve months each beginning with the new moon; an extra month
was added periodically to bring this lunar calendar in accord with the
seasons and the sun. 71 Life on earth was lived in harmony with life in

Each dragon held a copper ball in its mouth. When an earthquake
occurred, the dragon nearest its source dropped its ball into the mouth
of the toad. Once a dragon released its ball, though no shock had been
felt by the inhabitants. Chang Heng was ridiculed as a charlatan, until
a messenger arrived who told of an earthquake in a distant province .

<li><p>Christianity lost its opportunity early in the eighteenth
century, when a quarrel arose between the Jesuits and other Roman
Catholic orders in China. The Jesuits had, with characteristic
statesmanship, found formulas by which the essential elements of Chinese
piety — ancestor worship and the adoration of heaven — could be brought
under Christian forms without disrupting deep-rooted institutions or
endangering the moral stability of China; but the Dominicans and
Franciscans demanded a stricter interpretation, and de- nounced all
Chinese theology and ritual as inventions of the devil. The enlightened
Emperor K’ang -hsi was highly sympathetic to Christianity; he entrusted
his children to Jesuit tutors, and offered on certain conditions to
become a Christian. When the Church officially adopted the rigid
attitude of the Dominicans and the Franciscans, K’ang -hsi withdrew his
support of Christianity, and his successors decided to oppose it
actively. 91 In later days the greedy imperialism of the West weakened
the persuasiveness of Chris - tian preaching, and precipitated the
passionate anti-Christianism of the revolutionary Chinese.</p></li>

West — so that a coolie carry- ing dung through the streets might show
better breeding, and more self- respect, than the alien merchant who

God of Wealth with too frank an idolatry, 1 ® and was as hungry for gold
as a caricatured American; he was capable occasionally of cruelty and
bru- tality, and accumulating injustices sometimes provoked him to mass
out- breaks of pillage and slaughter. But in nearly all cases he was
peaceable and kindly, ready to help his neighbors, disdainful of
criminals and war- riors, thrifty and industrious, leisurely but steady
at his work, simple and unassuming in his mode of life, and
comparatively honest in commerce and finance. He was silent and patient
under the whip of adversity, and took good and evil fortune alike with a
wise humility; he bore bereave- ment and agony with fatalistic
self-control, and showed little sympathy for those who suffered them
audibly; he mourned long and loyally for his departed relatives, and
(when all his compromises had failed to elude it) faced his own death
with philosophic calm. He was as sensitive to beauty as he was
insensitive to pain; he brightened his cities with colorful decora-
tion, and adorned his life with the maturest art.</p></li>

collecting taxes and “squeezes,” judging such cases as volun - tary

nineteenth century, and left the nation essentially leaderless when half
the wealth and power of the world were joining in an assault upon its
independence, its resources and its institutions.</p></li>

exacted of China by Japan in 1894, and the 00,000,000 indemnity asked by
the Allies after the Boxer Rebellion, the collapse of China becomes a
mere matter of bookkeeping.</p></li>

<li><p>Wealth accumulated, and was centered in a fashionable life of
luxury, refinement and culture hardly equaled again until the courts of
the Medici and the salons of the French Enlightenment. Kyoto became the
Paris and Versailles of France, elegant in poetry and dress, practised
in manners and arts, and setting for all the nation the standards of
learning and taste. Every appetite was full</p></li>
<li><p>Crime rose among the poor as luxury mounted among the rich;
brigands and pirates infested the roads and the seas, and preyed impar-
tially upon the people and the emperor; tax-gatherers were robbed as
they brought their revenues to the court. Gangs of bandits were
organized in the provinces, and even in the capital itself; for a time
Japan’s most notorious criminal, like ours, lived in open splendor, too
powerful to be arrested or annoyed . 88 The neglect of martial habits
and virtues, or military or- ganization and defense, left the government
exposed to assault from any ruthless buccaneer. The great families
raised their own armies, and began an epoch of civil war in which they
contended chaotically for the right to name the emperor. The emperor
himself was every day more helpless, while the heads of the clans became
again almost independent lords. Once more history moved in its ancient
oscillation between a powerful central government and a feudal
decentralized regime.</p></li>

religion in Japan, and ordered all converts either to depart from the
country or to renounce their new beliefs. Many priests evaded the
decree, and some of them were arrested. None was executed during the
lifetime of Iyeyasu; but after his death the fury of the bureaucrats was
turned against the Christians, and a violent and brutal persecution
ensued which practically stamped Christianity out of Japan. In 1638 the
remaining Christians gathered to the number of 37,000 on the peninsula
of Shima- bara, fortified it, and made a last stand for the freedom of
worship.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1596 a Spanish galleon was forced into a Japanese harbor by
Japanese boats, was purposely driven by them upon a reef that broke it
in two, and then was pillaged by the local governor on the ground that
Japanese law permitted the authorities to appro- priate all vessels
stranded on their shores. The outraged pilot, Landecho, protested to
Hideyoshi’s Minister of Works, Masuda. Mas uda asked how it was that the
Christian Church had won so many lands to be subject to one man; and
Landecho, being a seaman rather than a diplomat, answered: “Our kings
begin by sending, into the countries they wish to conquer, religieux who
induce the people to embrace our religion; and when they have made
considerable progress, troops are sent who combine with the new
Christians; and then our kings have not much trouble in accomplishing
the rest.” 68</p></li>

their beauty, through the drinking of tea; and reformers de- nounced the

men and women how flowers should be grown in the garden and placed in
the home; it was not enough, they said, to admire the blossoms, but one
must learn to see as much loveliness in the leaf, the bough or the stalk
as in the flower, as much beauty in one flower as in a thousand; and one
must arrange them with a view not merely to color but to grouping and
line.“ Tea, flowers, poetry, and the dance became requisites of

<li><p>Bound by ties of interest to the new society, the old aris-
tocracy gave its services loyally to the Government, and enabled it to
ef- fect with bloodless ease the transition from a medieval to a modern
state. Ito Hirobumi, recently returned from a second visit to Europe,
created, in imitation of Germany, a new nobility of five orders —
princes, marquises, counts, viscounts and barons; but these men were the
rewarded servants, not the feudal enemies, of the industrial
regime.</p></li>
<li><p>This process corresponded essentially to the abolition of
feudalism, serfdom or slavery in France in 1789, in Russia in 1862, and
in the United States in 1863.</p></li>
<li><p>9</p></li>
<li><p>Strikes were frequent and communism was growing when the war
spirit of 1931 turned the nation to patriotic cooperation and
conformity; “dangerous thoughts” were made illegal, and labor unions,
never strong in Japan, were sub- jected to severe restrictions. 50 Great
slums developed in Osaka, Kobe and Tokyo; in those of Tokyo a family of
five occupied an average room</p></li>
<li><p>The low remuneration of women is partly due to the expensively
high turn-over among the women workers, who usually leave industry when
they have amassed a mar- riage dowry.</p></li>
<li><p>Shoes are replacing wooden clogs as roads improve; but a large
proportion of both sexes still move about in bare and undeformed feet.
In the greater cities one may find every variation and combination of
native and European dress, as if to symbolize a transformation hurried
and incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p>Women engaged in teaching or industry wear uniforms of Occidental
cut. Both sexes, after working hours, relax into die traditional
costumes.</p></li>
<li><p>The typical Japanese has all the qualities of the warrior —
pugnacity and cour- age, and an unrivaled readiness to die; and yet,
very often, he has the soul of an artist — sensuous, impressionable, and
almost instinctively possessed of taste. He is sober and unostentatious,
frugal and industrious, curious and . studious, loyal and patient, with
an heroic capacity for details; he is cun- ning and supple, like most
physically small persons; he has a nimble in- telligence, not highly
creative in the field of thought, but capable of quick comprehension,
adaptation, and practical achievement. The spirit and van- ity of a
Frenchman, the courage and narrowness of a Briton, the hot temper and
artistry of an Italian, the energy and commercialism of an American, the
sensitiveness and shrewdness of a Jew — all these have come together to
make the Japanese.</p></li>
<li><p>Japanese medicine, though de- pendent in most stages upon China
or Korea, has made swift progress under European — especially German —
example and stimulus. The work of Takamine in the discovery of adrenalin
and the study of vitamins; of Kitasato in tetanus and pneumonia, and in
the development of an anti-toxin for diphtheria; and, most famous and
brilliant of all, of Noguchi in syphilis and yellow fever — these
achievements indicate the rapidity with which the Japanese have ceased
to be pupils, and have become teachers, of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Such science as existed in Japan before 1853 was mostly an
importation from the parental mainland. The Japanese calendar,
previously based upon the phases of the moon, was readjusted to the
solar year by a Korean priest about 604 a.d. In 680 a.d. Chinese
modifications were introduced, and Japan took over (and still retains)
the Chinese method of reckoning events by reference to the name and year
of the reigning emperor. The Gregorian calendar was adopted by Japan in
1873.</p></li>
<li><p>5</p></li>
<li><p>It had doubled in a century, and the mountain - ribbed islands,
so sparsely arable, contained with difficulty their multiply- ing
millions. An insular population half as great as that of the United
States had to support itself on an area one-twentieth as large. 38 It
could maintain itself only by manufactures; and yet Japan was tragically
poor in the fuels and minerals indispensable to industry. Hydro-electric
power</p></li>
<li><p>In 1934 the population of the Japanese Empire (i.e., Japan,
Korea, Formosa and some minor possessions) totaled eighty millions.
Should Japan succeed in reconciling the in- habitants of Manchuria to
Japanese rule, it will control, for industry and war, 110,000,000
people. As the population of Japan alone increases by a million a year,
and that of the United States is rapidly approaching a stationary
condition, the two systems may soon confront each other with
approximately equal populations.</p></li>
<li><p>At the close of the Conference Japan agreed to return to China
that part of Shantung (Tsingtao) which she had taken from Ger- many
during the War. The Anglo- Japanese Alliance died a silent death, and
America dreamed cozily of eternal peace.</p></li>
<li><p>instead it forbade the entrance of Asiatics altogether.
Approximately the same result would have been se- cured by applying the
quota to all races, without discrimination or name; and Secretary Hughes
protested “that the legislation would seem to be quite unnecessary even
for the purpose for which it is devised.” 43 But hot-heads interpreted
as a threat the warning uttered by the Japanese Am- bassador of the
“grave consequences” that might come from the act; and in a fever of
resentment the Immigration Bill was passed.</p></li>
<li><p>By this principle the number of immigrants from any country was
to bear the same ratio to the total of permitted annual immigration as
persons of that nationality had borne to the total population of America
in 1890.</p></li>
<li><p>the oldest irrigation systems, and the firstf production of those
encouraging beverages without which, apparently, modem civilization
could hardly exist — beer and wine and tea. Handicrafts and engineering
were as highly developed in Egypt before Moses as in Europe before
Voltaire; building with bricks has a history at least as old as Sargon
I; the potter’s wheel and the wagon wheel appear first in Elam, line n
and glass in Egypt, silk and gunpowder in China. The horse rides out of
Central Asia into Mesopotamia, Egypt and Europe; Phoenician vessels
circum- navigate Africa before the age of Pericles; the compass comes
from China and produces a commercial revolution in Europe. Sumeria shows
us the first business contracts, the first credit system, the first use
of gold and</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that agriculture and the domestication of animals
are as ancient in neo- lithic Europe as in neolithic Asia; but it seems
more likely that the New Stone Age cultures of Europe were younger than
those of Africa and Asia. Cf. Chapter VI above.</p></li>

<li><p>winter rains nourished the earth, and moderate frosts stimulated
men; there, almost all the year round, one might live an open-air life
under a warm but not enervating sun. And yet the surface of the
Mediterranean coasts and islands is nowhere so rich as the alluvial
valleys of the Ganges, the Indus, the Tigris, the Euphrates, or the
Nile; the summer’s drought may begin too soon or last too long; and
everywhere a rocky basis hirks under the thin crust of the dusty earth.
The temperate north and the tropic south are both more fertile than
these historic lands where patient peasants, weary of coaxing the soil,
more and more abandoned tillage to grow olives and the vine. Aud at any
moment, along one or another of a hundred faults, earthquakes might
split the ground benea th men’s feet, and frighten them into a fitful
piety. Climate did not draw civilization to Greece; probably it has
never made a civiliza- tion anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Fog was rare in the Mediter- ranean, and the unfailing sunshine
so varied the coastal winds that at almost any harbor, from spring to
autumn, one might be carried out by a morning, and brought back by an
evening, breeze.</p></li>

<li><p>Evans labored brilliantly at Cnossus for many years, was knighted
for his discoveries, and completed, in 1936, his monumental four-volume
report. The Piuace of Minos.</p></li>
<li><p>Classifying the pottery, and correlating the remains with those
of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, Evans divided the post- neolithic and
prehistoric culture of Crete into three ages — Early, Middle, and Late
Minoan — and each of these into three periods.t</p></li>
<li><p>The men as well as the women wear their hair partly in coils on

<li><p>The usually cautious and accurate Thucydides writes:</p></li>
<li><p>The first person known to us by tradition as having established a
navy is Minos. He made himself master of what is now called the Hellenic
Sea, and ruled over the Cyclades. . . . He did his best to put down
piracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues for his
own use.”</p></li>
<li><p>By our standards the minor streets are narrow, mere alleys in the
style of a semitropical Orient that fears the sun; and the rectangular
houses, of wood or brick or stone, are for the most part confined to a
single floor. Yet some Middle Minoan plaques exhumed at Cnossus show us
homes of two, three, even five stories, with a cubicle attic or turret
here and there; on the upper floors, in these pictured houses, are
windows with red panes of unknown material. Double doors, swinging on
posts apparently of cypress wood, open from the ground-floor rooms upon
a shaded court. Stairways lead to the upper floors and the roof, where
the Cretan sleeps when the nights are very warm. If he spends the
evening indoors he lights his room by burning oil, according to h^
income, in lamps of clay, steatite, gypsum, marble, or bronze.</p></li>
<li><p>® Since his death rate is high he pays devout homage to
fertility, and when he rises to the notion of a human divinity he pic-
tures a mother goddess with generous mammae and sublime flanks, with
rep- tiles creeping up around her arms and breasts, coiled in her hair,
or rearing themselves proudly from her head. He sees in her the basic
fact of nature — that man’s greatest enemy, death, is overcome by
woman’s mysterious power, reproduction; and he identifies this power
with deity. The mother goddess represents for him the source of all
life, in plants and animals as well as in men; if he surrounds her image
with fauna and flora it is because these exist through her creative
fertility, and therefore serve as her symbols and her emanations.
Occasionally she appears holding in her arms her divine child Velchanos,
whom she has borne in a mountain cave.® Contemplating this ancient
image, we see through it Isis and Homs, Ishtar and Tammuz, Cybele and
Attis, Aphrodite and Adonis, and feel the unity of prehistoric culture,
and the continuity of religious ideas and symbols, in the Mediterranean
world.</p></li>

Minoan I are strikingly hke those found in Proto-Dynastic tombs; the
double ax appears as an amulet in Egypt, and even a “Priest of the
Double Ax”; the weights and measures, though Asiatic in value, are
Egyptian in form; the methods used in the glyptic arts, in faience, and
in painting are so similar in the two lands that Spengler reduced Cretan
civilization to a mere branch of the Egyptian.“</p></li>

Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Polish, and Arabic. Now he went
to Greece, studied the language as a living speech, and was
soon</p></li>
<li><p>Henceforth, he declared, “I should find it impossible to live
anywhere but on classical soil.’” Since his Russian wife refused to
leave Russia, he adver - tised for a Greek wife, laid down precise
specifications for the position, and at the age of forty-seven chose a
bride of nineteen from among the photo- graphs he received. He married
her almost at sight, and unwittingly in the ancient style of purchase;
her parents charged him for her a price com- mensurate with their
conception of his fortune. When his new wife bore him children he
reluctantly consented to baptize them, but solemnized the ceremony by
laying a copy of the Iliad upon their heads and reading a hundred
hexameters aloud. He named them Andromache and Agamemnon, called his
servants Telamon and Pelops, and christened his Athenian home
Bellerophon.’ He was an old man mad about Homer.</p></li>

placed the objects where he found them; and at the same time the Sublime
Porte sued him for taking gold from Turkish soil. But scholars like
Virchow, Dorpfeld, and Bumouf came to the site, verified Schliemann’s
reports, an d carried on the work with him until one buried Troy after
another was uncovered, and the problem was no longer whether Troy had
existed, but which of the nine Troys exhumed had been the Ilios of the
Iliad.</p></li>
<li><p>he sank thirty-four shafts at Mycenae in the eastern
Peloponnesus. Turkish officials interrupted the work by claiming half of
the material that he had found at Troy. Unwilling to let the precious
“Treasury of Priam” lie unseen in Turkey, Schliemaim clandestinely dis -
patched the objects to the State Museum at Berlin, paid the Porte five
times more damages than were required of him, and resumed his digging at
Mycenae. Again he was rewarded; and when he saw his workers carrying up
to him skeletons, pottery, jewelry, and golden masks, he telegraphed
joyfully to the King of Greece that he had discovered the tombs of
Atreus and Agamemn on.” In 1884 he moved on to Tiryns and, guided again
by Pausanias, unearthed the great palace and cyclopean walls that Homer
had described.”</p></li>

described it in his Periegesis^ of Tour.</p></li>
<li><p>Year by year, as Dorpfeld and Muller, Tsountas and</p></li>
<li><p>Greek tradition called the Mycenaeans “Pelasgi” (possibly mean -

Thrace and Thessaly into Attica and the Peloponnesus in a past so
distant that the Greeks termed them aborigines. Herodotus ac-</p></li>

civiliza- tion agreed with the Mycenaean in many ways, it differed in

<li><p>Hera, who did not relish these jovial condescensions, sent two
serpents to destroy the babe in the cradle; but the boy grasped one in
each hand and strangled them both; therefore he was called Heracles, as
having won glory through Hera. Linus, oldest name in the history of
music, tried to teach the youth how to play and sing; but Heracles did
not care for music, and slew Linus with the lyre. When he grew up — a
clumsy, bibulous, gluttonous, kindly giant — he undertook to kill a lion
that was ravaging the flocks of Amphitryon and Thespius. The latter.
King of Thespiae, offered his home and his fifty daughters to Heracles,
who rose to the occasion manfully .“ He slew the lion, and wore its skin
as his garb. He married Megara, daughter of Creon of Thebes, and tried
to settle do-wn; but Hera sent a madness upon him, and imwittingly he
killed his o’wn children. He consulted the oracle at Delphi, and was

As social organization advances, paternal authority and family unity

for nine years in vain; they are despondent, homesick, and decimated

sea; and Agamem- non had embittered Clytaemnestra, and prepared his own
fate, by sacrificing their daughter Iphigenia for a breeze. On the way
up the coast the Greeks had stopped here and there to replenish their
supplies of food and concubines; Aga- memnon had taken the fair
Chryseis, Achilles the fair Briseis. A soothsayer now declares that
Apollo is withholding success from the Greeks because Aga- memnon has
violated the daughter of Apollo’s priest, Chryses. The King restores
Chryseis to her father, but, to console himself and point a tale, he
com- p els Briseis to leave Achilles and take Chryseis’ place in the
royal tent. Achilles convokes a general assembly, and denounces
Agamemnon with a wrath that provides the first word and the recurring
theme of the Iliad. He vows that neither he nor his soldiers will any

gave them a merciless supremacy over Achaeans and Cretans who still used
bronze to kill. Probably from both west and east, from Elis and Megara,
they came down upon the separate little kingdoms of the Peloponnesus,
put the ruling classes to the sword, and turned the Mycenaean remnant
into helot-serfs. Mycenae and Tiryns went up in flames, and for some
centuries Argos be- came the capital of Pelops’ isle. On the Isthmus the
invaders seized a com - manding peak — the Acrocorinthus — and built
around it the Dorian city of Corinth.“® The surviving Achaeans fled,
some of them into the mountains of the northern Peloponnesus, some into
Attica, some overseas to the islands and coasts of Asia. The conquerors
followed them .into Attica, but were repulsed; they followed them to

colonized Melos, Thera, Cos, Cnidus, and Rhodes. Throughout the
Peloponnesus and Crete, where the Mycenaean culture had most flourished,

<li><p>On this coast, at Epidamnus (the Roman Dyrrachium, now Durazzo),
Caesar disembarked his troops in pursuit of Pom- pey. Across the
Adriatic the expanding Greeks snatched the lower coasts from the native
tribes, and gave civilization to Italy. (In the end those native tribes
would sweep back upon them, and one tribe, almost barbarous till
Alexander’s time, would swallow them up, along with their motherland, in
an unprecedented empire.) Beyond the Alps ranged the Gauls, who were to
prove very friendly to the Greek city of Massalia (Marseilles); and at
the western end of the Mediterranean lay Spain, already half civilized
and fully exploited by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians when, about
550, the Greeks established their timid colony at Emporium (Ampurias).
On the coast of Africa, menacingly opposite Sicily, was imperial
Carthage, founded by Dido and the Phoenicians, tradition said, in 813;
no mere village, but a city of 700,000 population, monopo- lizing the
commerce of the western Mediterranean, dominating Utica, Hippo, and
three hundred other towns in Africa, and controlling prosperous lands,
mines, and colonies in Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain. This fabulously
wealthy metropolis was fated to lead the Oriental thrust against Greece
in the west, as Persia would lead it in the east.</p></li>

<li><p>When Hecataeus of Miletu s boasted to the Egyptian priests that
he could trace his ancestry through fifteen gen- erations to a god, they
quietly showed him, in their sanctuaries, the statues of 345 high
priests, each the son of the preceding, making 345 generations since the
gods had reigned on earth.® From the Egyptian cults of Isis and Osiris,
in the belief of Greek scholars like Herodotus and Plutarch, came the
Orphic doctrine of a judgment after death, and the resurrection ritual
of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis.® Probably in Egypt, Thales of
Miletus learned geometry, and Rhoecus and Theodorus of Samos picked up
the art of hollow casting in bronze; in Egypt the Greeks acquired new
skills in pottery, textiles, metalwork- ing, and ivory;’ there, as well
as from the A ssyrians, Phoenicians, and Hittites, Greek sculptors took
the style of their early statues — flat-faced, slant-eyed, closefisted,
straight-limbed, stiff;</p></li>

each of the 360 degrees into 60 minutes, and each of the minutes into 60
seconds; it was presumably his acquaintance with Egyptian and Babylonian
astronomy that enabled Thales to predict an eclipse of the sun.“
Probably from Babylonia came Hesiod’s notion of Chaos as the or igin of
all things; and the story of Ishtar and Tammuz is suspiciously like
those of Aphro^ dite and Adonis, Demeter and Persephone.</p></li>
<li><p>— Lydia maintained intimate relations with Ionia, and its
brilliant capital, Sardis, was a clearinghouse for the traflSc in goods
and ideas between Mesopotamia and the Greek cities on the coast. The
necessities of an extensive trade stimulated banking, and caused the
Lydian government, about 680, to issue a state-guaranteed coinage. This
boon to trade was soon imitated and improved by the Greeks, and had
effects as momentous and interminable as those that came from the
introduction of the alphabet. — The influence of Phrygia was older and
subtler. Its mother goddess, Cybele, entered directly and deviously into
Greek religion, and its orgiastic flute music became that “Phrygian
mode” so popular among the populace, and so dis - turbing to the
moralists, of Greece. From Phrygia this wild music crossed the
Hellespont into Thrace, and served the rites of Dionysus. The god of
wine was the chief gift of Thrace to Greece; but one Thracian city,
Hellenized Abdera, sought to even the balance by giving Greece three
philosophers — Leucippus, Democritus and Protagoras. It was from Thrace
that the cult of the Muses passed down into Hellas; and the
half-legendary founders of Greek music — Orpheus, Musaeus, and Thamyris
— were Thracian singers and bards.</p></li>
<li><p>We shall attempt it by the pleasant method of a tour: with a map
at our elbow and no expenditure but of the imagination, we shall pass
from city to city of the Greek world, and observe in each center the
life of the people before the Persian war — the modes of economy and
government, the activities of scientists and philosophers, the
achievements of poetry, and the creations of art.f The plan has many
faults: the geo- graphical sequence will not quite agree with the
historical; we shall be leaping from century to century as well as from
isle to isle; and we shall find ourselves talking with Thales and
Anaximander before listening to Homer and Hesiod. But it will do us no
harm to see the irreverent Iliad against its actual background of Ionian
skepticism, or to hear Hesiod’ s dour plaints after visiting the Aeolian
colonies from which his harassed father came. When at last we reach
Athens we shall know in some measure the rich variety of the
civilization that it inherited, and which it preserved so bravely at
Marathon.</p></li>
<li><p>”</p></li>
<li><p>These figures, of course, are conjectural, being based upon a few
hints and many assump-</p></li>
<li><p>Tyrtaeus, said the Spartan</p></li>
<li><p>He could write hymns and paeans as well as songs of wine and
love, and the Spartans liked especially the parthenia, or maiden songs,
which he composed for choruses of girls. A fragment now and then reveals
that power of imaginative feeling which is the heart of poetry:</p></li>
<li><p>We shall record the tradition, while remem- bering that it has in
all likelihood personified and foreshortened a process of change, from
cxistom to law, that required many authors and many years.</p></li>
<li><p>At the age of seven the Spartan boy was taken from his family and
brought up by the state; he was en- rolled in what was at once a
military regiment and a scholastic class, under a paidonomos, or manager
of boys. In each class the ablest and bravest boy was made captain; the
rest were instructed to obey him, to submit to the punishments he might
impose upon them, and to strivfe to match or better him in achievement
and discipline. The aim was not, as at Athens, athletic form and skill,
but martial courage and worth. Games were played in the nude, under the
eyes of elders and lovers of either sex. The older men made it their
concern to provoke quarrels among the boys, individu- ally and in
groups, so that vigor and fortitude might be tested and trained; and any
moment of cowardice brought many days of disgrace. To bear pain,
hardship, and misfortune silently was required of all. Every year, at
the altar of Artemis Orthia, some chosen youths were scourged till their
blood stained the stones.</p></li>
<li><p>and it was easy to keep up with the publishers. Lycurgus, said
Plutarch, wished children to learn his laws not by writing but by oral
transmission and youthful practice under care- ful guidance and example;
it was safer, he thought, to make men good by unconscious habituation
than to rely upon theoretical persuasion; a proper education would be
the best government. But such education would have to be moral rather
than mental; character was more important than intel- lect. The young
Spartan was trained to sobriety, and some Helots were compelled to drink
to excess in order that the youth might see how foolish drunkenness can
be.“ He was taught, in preparation for war, to forage</p></li>
<li><p>Only choral dance and music remained, for there Spartan
discipline could shine, and the individ- ual could be lost in the mass.
Excluded from commerce with the world, barred from travel, ignorant of
the science, the literature, and the philoso- phy of exuberantly growing
Greece, the Spartans became a nation of excel- lent hoplites, with the
mentality of a lifelong infantryman. Greek travelers marveled at a life
so simple and unadorned, a franchise so jealously con- fined, a
conservatism so tenacious of every custom and superstition, a cour- age
and discipline so exalted and limited, so noble in character, so base in
purpose, and so barren in result; while, hardly a day’s ride away, the
Athe - nians were building, out of a thousand injustices and errors, a
civilization broad in scope and yet intense in action, open to every new
idea and eager for intercourse with the world, tolerant, varied,
complex, luxurious, inno- vating, skeptical, imaginative, poetical,
turbulent, free. It was a contrast that would color and almost delineate
Greek history.</p></li>
<li><p>Under his able successors, Myron and Qeisthenes, these classes
made Sicyon a semi-industrial city, famous for its shoes and its
pottery, though still named from the cucumbers that it grew.</p></li>

thunderbolt.”</p></li>

<li><p>” Above are the twin peaks of Parnassus, where th e Muses dwelt
when they tired of Helicon. Greeks who climbed a hundred tortuous miles
to stand on this mountainside — poised on a ledge between mist-shrouded
heights and a sunlit sea, and surrounded on every side with beauty or
terror — could hardly doubt that beneath these rocks Hved some awful
god. Time and again earthquake had rumbled here, frightening away the
plundering Persians, and a century later the plundering Phocians, and a
century later the plundering Gauls; it was the god protecting his
shrine. As far back as Greek tradition could reach, worshipers had
gathered here to find in the winds among the gorges, or the gases
escaping from the earth, the voice and will of deity. The great stone
that nearly closed the cleft from which the gases came was, to the
Greeks, the center of Greece, and therefore the omphalos, as they called
it, the umbilicus or very navel of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>On the west coast near Calydon is the modem Mesolongion, or
Missolonghi, where Marco Bozzaris fought and Byron died.</p></li>

from Ossa to Pelion.</p></li>
<li><p>Far- ther south is Tanagra, whose poetess Corinna won the prize
from Pindar about 500 B.C., and whose potters, in the fifth and fourth
centuries, would make the most famous statuettes in history. Five miles
south again and we are in Attica. From the peaks of the Pames range we
can make out the hills of Athens.</p></li>
<li><p>Only adventurous trade, and the patient culture of the olive and
the grape, made civilization possible in Attica.</p></li>
<li><p>— fleeing from Boeotia and the Peloponnesus’in the face of the
northern migrations and invasions. Here was no conquering alien race
exploiting a native population, but a complex Mediterranean stock, of
medium stature and dark features, directly inheriting the blood and cul-
ture of the old Helladic civilization, proudly conscious of its
indigenous quality,® and excluding from its national sanctuary, the
Acropolis, those half-barbarian upstarts, the Dorians.®</p></li>
<li><p>home of Ajax and Euripides; then to Eleusis, sacred to Demeter
and her mysteries; and then back to the Piraeus. Into this sheltered
port, neglected before Themistocles revealed its possibiUties, ships
were to bring the goods of all the Mediterranean world for the use and
pleasure of Athens. The barreimess of the soil, the nearness of the
coast, the abundance of har- bors lured the people of Attica into trade;
their courage and inventiveness won for them the markets of the Aegean;
and out of that commercial em- pire came the wealth, the power, and the
culture of Athens in the Periclean age.</p></li>
<li><p>t Tradition placed diis event in the thirteenth century b.c.; but
the union of Attica under Athens could hardly have been completed before
700, since t he “Homeric” Hymn to Demeter, composed about that date,
speaks of Eleusis as still having its own king.®</p></li>

oxen and could equip themselves to fight as hoplites or heavy-armed
troops; and the thetes, hired laborers who fought as light-armed
infantry. Only the first two were accounted citizens; and only the
knights could serve as archons, judges, or priests. After completing
their term of office the archons, if no scandal had tarnished them,
became automatically and for life members of the boule or Council that
met in the cool of the evening on the Areopagus, or Ares’ hill, chose
the archon s, and ruled the state. Even under the monarchy this Senate
of the Areopagus had limited the authority of the king; now, under the
oligarchy, it was as supreme as its counterpart in Rome.”</p></li>

According to Plutarch’s fuller ac - count, Solon “made the mina, which
before passed for seventy -three drach- mas, go for a hundred, so that,
though the number of pieces in a payment was equal, the value was less;
which proved a considerable benefit to those that were to discharge
great debts, and no loss to the creditors.”“ Only the genial and
generous Plutarch could devise a form of inflation that would relieve
debtors without hurting creditors — except that doubtless in some cases
half a loaf is better than none.t</p></li>
<li><p>Such inflation, however, would have fallen as a second blow upon
those landlords who had lent sums to merchants; if it helped any class,
it helped these merchants rather than the landlords or the peasants —
whose mortgages had alrwdy been forgiven. Possibly Solon had no thought
of debasing the currency, but wished merely to substitute, for a
monetary standard that had been found convenient in trading with the
Peloponnesus, another that would facilitate trade with the rich and
growing markets of Ionia, where the Euboic standard was in common
use.®</p></li>

hundred measures; third, the zeugitai, with incomes between two and

Honors and taxes were determined by the same rating, and the one could
not be enjoyed without paying the other; fur- thermore, the first class
was taxed on twelve times, the second class on ten times, the third
class on only five times, the amount of its annual in- come; the
property tax was in effect a graduated income tax.® The fourth class was
exempt from direct taxation. Only the first class was eligible to the
archonship or to military commands; the second class was eligible to
lower offices and to the cavalry; the third was privileged to join the
heavy- armed infantry; the fourth was expected to provide the common
soldiers of the state. This peculiar classification weakened the kinship
organiza- tion upon which the oligarchy had rested its power, and
established the new principle of “timocracy”— government by honor or
prestige as fr ankl y determined by t axable wealth. A similar
“plutocracy” prevailed, through - out the sixth and part of the fifth
century, in most of the Greek colonies.</p></li>

concentration of wealth, and the inabil- ity of the wealthy to agree on
a compromise. Forced to choose, the poor, like the rich, love money more
than political liberty; and the only political freedom capable of
enduring is one that is so pruned as to keep the rich from denuding the
poor by ability or subtlety and the poor from robbing the rich by
violence or votes. Hence the road to power in Greek commer- cial cities
was simple: to attack the aristocracy, defend the poor, and come to an
understanding with the middle classes.“ Arrived at power, the dictator
abolished debts, or confiscated large estates, taxed the rich to finance
public works, or otherwise redistributed the overconcentrated wealth;
and while attaching the masses to himself through such measures, he
secured the support of the business community by promoting trade with
state coinage and commercial treaties, and by raising the social
prestige of the bourgeoisie. Forced to depend upon popularity instead of

Peisistratus, saw their opportunity, raised an army, and marched upon
Athens with the announced intention of deposing Hippias. At the same
time they bribed the Pythian oracle to tell all Spartans who consulted
her that Sparta must overthrow the tyranny at Athens. Hippias
successfully resisted the forces of the Alcmaeonids; but when a Lacedae-
monian army joined them he withdrew to the Areopagus. Seeking the
security of his children in the event of his own death, he sent them
secretly out of Athens; but they were captured by the invaders, and
Hippias, as the price of their safety, consented to abdication and exile
(510). The Alcmaeonids, led by the courageous Cleisthenes,t entered
Athens in tri- umph; and on their heels came the banished aristocrats,
prepared to cele- brate the return of their property and their
power.</p></li>

<li><p>Such exile involved no confiscation of property, and no disgrace;

introduction of ostracism and its disuse at Athens, only ten persons
were banished by it from Attica.</p></li>
<li><p>But it gave all legislative, executive, and judicial power to an
Assembly and a Court composed’ of the citizens, to magistrates ap-
pointed by and responsible to the Assembly, and to a Council for whose

operation of the lot, at least one third of them actually shared for at
least a year of their lives. Never before had the world seen so liberal

<li><p>For the rest he gave himself to study, with the absorbed devotion
suggested by the tale of his falling into a ditch while watching the

Persia.”</p></li>
<li><p>Let Arist otle tell the story: “They say that Thales, perceiving
by his skill in astrology (astronomy) that there would be great plenty
of olives that year, while it was yet winter hired at a low price all
the oil presses in Miletus and Chios, there being no one to bid against
him. But when the season came for making oil, many persons wanting them,
he all at once let them upon what terms he pleased; and raising a large
sum of money by that means, con- vinced them that it was easy for
philosophers to be rich if t hey chose it.”^</p></li>
<li><p>As these theorems founded Greek geometry, so his studies of
astronomy established that sci- ence for Western civilization, and
disentangled it from its Oriental asso- ciations with astrology. He made
several minor observations, and startled all Ionia by successfully
predicting an eclipse of the sun for May 28, 585 B,c.,“ probably on the
basis of Egyptian records and Babylonian calcula - tions. For the rest
his theory of the universe was not appreciably superior to the current
cosmology of the Egyptians and the Jews. The world, he thought, was a
hemisphere resting on an endless expanse of water, and the earth was a
flat disk floating on the flat side of the interior of this hemisphere.
We are reminded of Goethe’s remark that a man’s vices (or errors) are
common to him with his epoch, but his virtues (or insights) are his

<li><p>This animate and eternal but impersonal and unmoral Infinite is
the only God in Anaximander’s system; it is the unvary - ing and
everlasting One, as distinguished from the mutable evanescent Many of
the world of things. (Here stems the metaphysics of the Eleatic School —
that only the eternal One is real.) From this characterless Infinite are
bom new worlds in endless succession, and to it in endless succession
they return as they evolve and die. In the primordial Infinite all
opposites are con- tained — hot and cold, moist and dry, liquid and
solid and gas . . . ; in devel- opment these potential qualities become
actual, and make diverse and definite things; in dissolution these
opposed qualitiM are again resolved into the Infinite. (A source for
Heracleitus as well as for Spencer.) In this rise and fall of worlds the
various elements struggle with one another, and encroach upon each other
as hostile opposites. For this opposition they pay with dissolution;
“Things perish into those from which they have been bom.”</p></li>
<li><p>The sun, moon, and stars, he thought, moved in circles around the

models, constracted at Sparta a gnomon, or sundial, on which he showed

secular records of events, and rational interpretations of causes and
effects. In Hecataeus the process begins; in Herodotus it advances; in
Thucydides it is complete.</p></li>

<li><p>The city was known not only for its temple but for its poets, its
philoso- phers, and its expensively gowned women.“ Here, as early as 690
b.c., lived Callinus, the earliest known elegiac poet of Greece. Far
greater and uglier was Hipponax, who, towards 550, composed poems so
coarse in subject, obscure in language, pointed in wit, and refined in
metrical style, that all Greece began to talk about him, and all Ephesus
to hate him. He was short and thin, lame and deformed, and completely
disagreeable. Woman, he tells us, in one of his surviving fragments,

other when he buries her.”” He was a ruthless satirist, and lampooned

“Abundant learning,” he wrote with genial particularity, “does not form
the mind; if it did it would have instructed Hesiod, Pythagoras,
Xenophanes and Hecataeus” (16). “For the only real w isdom is to know
that idea which by itself will govern everything on every occasion”
(19). So he went off, like a Chinese sage, to live in the mountains and
brood over the one idea that would explain all things. Disdaining to
expound his conclusions in words intelligible to common men, and seeking
in obscurity of life and speech some safety from
individuality-destroying parties and mobs, he expressed his views in
pithy and enigmatical apophthegms On Nature, which he deposited in the
temple of Artemis for the mystification of posterity.</p></li>

stages of one process, two forms of one reality (25). “All things are

the Colophonians as “richly clothed in purple garments, proud of their

Mimnermus (610) sang, for a people already infected with the languid
pessimism of the Blast, his melancholy odes of fleeting youth and love.
He lost his heart to Nanno, the girl who accompanied his songs with the
plaintive obbligato of the flute; and when she rejected his love
(perhaps on the ground that a poet married is a poet dead), he im-
mortalized her with a sheaf of delicate elegiac verse.</p></li>

<li><p>here Leander and Byron swam the straits, and Xerxes’ army crossed
to Europe on a bridge of boats. Farther eastward the Phocaeans settled
Lampsacus, birthplace of Epi- curus. Within the Propontis lay two groups
of islands: the Proconnesus, rich in the marble that gave the Propontis
its current name, the Sea of Marmora; and the Arctonnesus, on whose
southernmost tip the Milesians established in 757 the great port of
Cyzicus. Along the coast rose one Greek city after an- other: Panormus,
Dascylium, Apameia, Cius, Astacus, Chalcedon. Up through the Bosporus
the Greeks advanced, hungry for metals, grain, and trade, found- ing
Chrysopolis (now Scutari) and Nicopolis — “city of victory.” Then they
made their way along the southern shore of the Black Sea, depositing
towns at Heracleia, Pontica, Tieum, and Sinope-a city splendidly
adorned, says Strabo,“ with gymnasium, agora, and shady colonnades;
Diogenes the Cynic was not above being bom here. Then Amisus, Oenoe,
Tripolis, and Trapezus (Trebizond, Trabzon) — where Xenophon’s Ten

this strategic port was becoming what Napoleon would call it at the
Peace of Tilsit — the key to Europe; in the third century b.c. Polybius
described its maritime position as “more favorable to security and pros
perity than that of any other city in the world known to us.”““
Byzantium grew rich by exacting tolls from passing ves - sels, and
exporting to the Greek world the grain of southern Russia (“Scythia”)
and the Balkans, and the fish that were netted with shameful ease as
they crowded through the narrow straits. It was its curving form, and
the wealth derived from this fishing industry, that gave the city its
later name, the “Golden Horn.” Under Pericles Athens dominated Byzantine
polities, levied tolls t here to fill her treasury in time of emergency,
and regulated the export of grain from the Black Sea as a contraband of
war.®</p></li>

<li><p>There, about a.d. i6o, Pausanias saw “the most holy and ancient
of all the temples that the Greeks have built to Aphrodite”;’ and there,
in 1887, Schliema nn dug its ruins out of the earth.’ Cythera was the
southernmost of the Ionian Islands that bordered the west coast of
Greece, and so named because Ionian immigrants settled them; Zacynthos,
Cephal- lenia, Ithaca, Leucas, Paxos, and Corcyra made the rest.
Schliemann thought that Ithaca was the island of Odysseus, and vainly
sought under its soil some confirmation of Homer’s tale;’ but Dorpfeld
believed that Odysseus’ home was on rocky Leucas. From the cliffs of
Leucas, as an annual sacri- fice to Apollo, the ancient Leucadians, says
Strabo, were in the habit of hurling a human victim; but being men as
well as theologians, they merci- fully attached to him powerful birds
whose wings might break his fall:’ probably the story of Sappho’s leap
is bound up with memories of this rite. Corinthian colonists occupied
Corcyra (Corfu) about 734 b.c., and soon became so strong that they
defeated Corinth’s navy and established their independence. From Corcyra
some Greek adventurers sailed up the Adriatic as far as Venice; some
made small settlements on the Dalmatian coast and in the valley of the
Po;’ others crossed at last through fifty miles of stormy water to the
heel of Italy.</p></li>
<li><p>The Greek invaders took possession of this coastal region by the
ruthless law of colonial expansion — that natural resources unex-
ploited by the native population will draw in, by a kind of chemical
attrac- tion, some other people to exploit them and pour them into the
commerce and usage of the world. From Brentesium (Brindisi) the
newcomers, chiefly Dorian, traversed the heel of the peninsula to
establish a major city</p></li>
<li><p>There they grew olives, raised horses, manufactured pottery,
built ships, netted fish, and gathered mus- sels to make a purple dye
more highly valued than the Phoenician/ As in most of the Greek
colonies, the government began as an oligarchy of land- owners, passed
under dictators financed by the middle class, and enjoyed vigorous and
turbulent intervals of democracy. Here the romantic Pyrrhus would land,

They were to dress simply and behave modestly, “never yielding to
laughter, and yet not looking stem.” They were not to swear by the gods,
for “every man ought so to live as to be worthy of belief without an
oath.” They were not to offer victims in sacrifice, but they might
worship at altars that were unstained with blood. At the close of each
day they were to ask them- selves what wrongs they had committed, what
duties they had neglected, what good they had done.®</p></li>
<li><p>Timon of Athens thought him “a juggler of solemn speech, engaged
in fishing for men”;” but among his most devoted followers were his wife
Theano and his daughter Damo, who had facilities for com- paring his
philosop hy with his life. To Damo, says Diogenes Laertius, “he
entrusted his Commentaries, and charged her to divulge them to no person
out of the house. And she, though she might have sold his discourses for
much money, would not abandon them, for she thought obedience to her
father’s injunctions more valuable than gold; and that, too, though she
was a woman.”</p></li>
<li><p>The scholars were ac- cordingly divided into exoterici, or outer
students, and esoterici, or inner members, who were entitled to the
secret wisdom of the Master himself. Four subjects composed the
curriculum: geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music. Mathematics came

permanently real; so Pythagoras felt that the only basic and lasting
aspects df anything were the numerical relationships of its parts, t

Sicily took on a perceptible native tint of passion and sensuality.“ The
Hellenes never quite conquered the island; the Phoenicians and
Carthagin- ians remained predominant on the west coast, and for five

<li><p>Zeus and his brothers cast lots to divide the world amongst them;
Zeus won the sky, Poseidon the sea. Hades the bowels of the earth. There
is no creation in this mythology: the world existed before the gods, and
the gods do not make man out of the slime but beget him by union among
themselves, or with their mortal offspring; God is literally the Father
in the theology of the Greeks. Nor are the Olympians omnipotent or
omniscient; each l^ts the other, or even opposes the other; any one of
them, especially Zeus, can be deceived. Nevertheless they acknowledge
his suzerainty, and crowd his court like the retainers of a feudal lord;
and though he consults them on occasion, and now and then yields his
preference to theirs,” he frequently puts them in their place.” He
begins as a sky -and-mountain-god, provider of the indispensable rain.t
Like Yahweh he is, among his earlier forms, a god of war; he debates
with himself whether to end the siege of Troy or “make the war more
bloody,” and decides for the latter course.” Gradually he becomes the
calm and mighty ruler of gods and men, bestriding Olympus in bearded
dignity. He is the head and source of the moral order of the world; he
punishes filial neglect, guards family property, sanctions oaths,
pursues perjurers, and protects boundaries, hearths, suppliants, and
guests. At last he is the serene dispenser of judgment whom Pheidias
carves for Olympia.</p></li>
<li><p>He loves also, with Greek impartiality, the handsome Ganymede,
and snatches him up to be his cupbearer on Olympus.</p></li>
<li><p>we shall see how the mutila- tion of these hermae on the eve of
the expedition against Syracuse provided the proximate cause for the
ruin of Alcibiades and Athens. Again he is the god of wayfarers and the
protector of heralds; their characteristic staff, or caduceus, is one of
his favorite insignia. As god of travelers he becomes a god of luck,
trade, cunning, and gain, therefore an inventor and guarantor of
measures and scales, a patron saint of perjurers, embezzlers, and
thieves.</p></li>

dialects — Aeolic, Doric, Ionic, Attic; but these were mutually intelli-

Perhaps it was necessary for an aristocrati c people, living among
slaves more numerous than themselves and frequently called upon to
defend their soil against more populous nations, to keep in good
condition. Ancient war depended upon physical vigor and skill, and these
were the original aim of the contests that filled Hellas with the noise
of their fame. We must not think of the average Greek as a student and
lover of Aeschylus or Plato; rather, like the typical Briton or
American, he was interested in sport, and his favored athletes were his
earthly gods.</p></li>

receive the human dead) black silhouettes of mourners, chariots, and
animals were drawn, however awkwardly, between the pattern’s lines. To

<li><p>It is amusing to read of the violent controversies concerning the
musical, ethical, and medical effects, restorative or disastrous, which
the Greeks — chiefly the philosophers — ascribed to these half-tone
variations. Dorian music, we are told, made men brave and dignified, the
Lydian made them sentimental and weak, the Phrygian made them excited
and headstrong. Plato saw effeminate luxury and gross immorality as the
offspring of most music, and wished to banish all instrumental per-
formances from his ideal state. Aristotle would have had all youths
trained in the Dorian mode.’® Theophrastus had a good word to say even
for the Phrygian mode; serious diseases, he tells us, can be made
painless by playing a Phrygian air near the affected part.’®</p></li>
<li><p>and dancing rivaled music in age and popularity among the Greeks.
Lucian, imable to trace its earthly beginnings, sought the origins of
the dance in the regular motions of the stars.®® Homer tells us not only
of the dancing floor made by Daedalus for Ariadne, but of an expert
dancer among the Greek warriors at Troy, Meriones, who, dancing while he
fought, could never be found by any lance.“ Plato described orchesiSy or
dancing, as “the instinctive desire to explain words by ges tures of the
entire body”— which is rather a description of certain modem languages;
Aristotle better defined the dance as “an imitation of actions,
characters, and passions by means of postures and rhythmical
movements.”®® Socrates himself danced, and praised the art as giving
health to every part of the body;®® he meant, of course, Greek
dancing.</p></li>
<li><p>Its forms were as varied as the types of poetry and song; ancient
authorities listed two hundred.®® There were religious dances, as among
the Dionysiac devotees; there were athletic dances, like Sparta’s
Gymnopedia, or Festival of Naked Youth; there were martial dances, like
the Pyrrhic, taught to children as part of military drill; there was the
stately hyporchemUy a choral hymn or play performed by two choirs of
which one alternately sang or danced while the other danced or sang;
there were folk dances for every major event of life and every season or
festival of the year. And as for everything else, there were dance
contests, usually involving choral song.</p></li>
<li><p>In part it was this religious basis that kept Greek tragedy on a
higher plane than that of the Elizabethan stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one thing was needed to turn these choral representations
into dramas, and that was the opposition of an actor, in dialogue and
action, to the chorus. This inspira- tion came to one of these dancing
instructors and chorus trainers, Thespis of Icaria — a town close to the
Peloponnesian Megara, where the rites of Dionysus were popular, and not
far from Eleusis, where the ritual drama of Demeter, Persephone, and
Dionysus Zagreus was annually performed. Helped no doubt by the egoism
that propels the world, Thespis separated himself from the chorus, gave
himself individual recitative lines, developed the notion of opposition
and conflict, and offered the drama in its stricter sense to history. He
played various roles with such verisimilitude that when his troupe
performed at Athens, Solon was shocked at what seemed to him a kind of
public deceit, and denounced this newfangled art as immoral”</p></li>

saving Greece; and because, when the war was over, Ionia was impov-

Shortly thereafter the Spartans found documents apparently implicating
Themistocles, in the secret correspond- ence of their regent Pausanias,
whom they had starved to death for enter- ing into traitorous
negotiations with Persia. Happy to destroy her ablest enemy, Sparta
revealed these papers to Athens, which at once sent out an order for
Themistocles’ arrest. He fled to Corcyra, was denied refuge there, found
brief asylum in Epirus, and thence sailed secretly to Asia, where he cl
aimed from Xerxes’ successor some reward for restraining the Greek
pursuit of the Persian fleet after Salamis. Lured by Themistocles’
promise to help him subjugate Greece,’ Artaxerxes I received him into
his counsels, and assigned the revenues of several cities for his
maintenance. Before Themistocles could carry out the schemes that never
let him rest he died at Magnesia in 449 b.c., at the age of sixty-five,

sister, or daughter in illicit relations he is entitled to kill the male
offender at once.®® Whether a killing is intentional or not it has to be

lawyer, and has to make in person the first presentation of his case.
But as the com- plexity of procedure rises, and litigants detect in the
jurors a certain sensitivity to eloquence, the practice grows of

For a time she loves and inspires Praxiteles, and poses for his
Aphrodites; from her, too, Apelles takes his Aphrodite Amdyomene.^ So
rich is Phryne from her loves that she offers to rebuild the walls of
Thebes if the Thebans will inscribe her name on the structure, which
they stubbornly refuse to do. Perhaps she asks too large an honorarium
from Euthias; he re- venges himself by indicting her on a charge of
impiety. But a member of the court is one of her clients, and

sing, dance, and love as arranged for. Educated Athenians prefer, now
and then, a symposium of conversation, conducted in an orderly manner by
a symposiarch chosen by a throw of the dice to act as chairman. The
guests take care not to break up the talk into small groups, which
usually means small talk; they keep the con- versation general, and
listen, as courteously as their vivacity will permit, to each man in
turn. So elegant a discourse as that which Plato offers us is doubtless
the product of his brilliant imagination; but probably Athens has known
dialogues as lively as his, perhaps profounder; and in any case it is
Athenian society that suggests and provides the background. In that

<li><p>the purpose is not to represent the indiscriminate irrelevancy of

portray the ideal possibilities of men. The pursuit of wealth, beauty,

<li><p>In his view art was first of all an adornment of the ways and
means of life: he wanted his pots and pans, his lamps and chests and
tables and beds and chairs to be at once serviceable and beautiful, and
never too ele- gant to be stron g. Having a vivid “sense of the state,”
he identified him - self with the power and glory of his city, and
employed a thousand artists to embellish its public places, ennoble its
festivals, and commemorate its history. Above all, he wished to honor or
propitiate the gods, to express his gratitude to them for life or
victory; he offered votive images, lavished his resources upon his
temples, and engaged statuaries to give to his gods or his dead an
enduring similitude in stone. Hence Greek art belonged not to a museum,
where men might go to contemplate it in a rare moment of esthetic
conscience, but to the actual interests and enterprises of the people;
its “Apollos” were not dead marbles in a gallery, but the likenesses of
beloved deities; its temples no mere curiosities for tourists, but the
homes of living gods. The artist, in this society, was not an insolvent
recluse in a studio, working in a language alien to the common citizen;
he was an artisan toiling with laborers of all degrees in a public and
intelligible task. Athens brought together, from all the Greek world, a
greater concourse of artists, as well as of philosophers and poets, than
any other city except Renaissance Rome; and these men, competing in
fervent rivalry and co- operating under enlightened statesmanship,
realized in fair measure the vision of Pericles.</p></li>
<li><p>“Among the ancients,” said Stendhal, “the beaudful is only the
high relief of the usefoL”</p></li>
<li><p>Upon the Stoa, which thereafter was called Poecile^ or the
Painted Portico, and which, three centuries later, would give its name
to the philosophy of Zeno, Polygnotus depicted the Sack of Troy — not
the bloody massacre of the night of victory, but the somber silence of
the morning after, with the victors quieted by the ruin around them, and
the defeated lying calm in death. On the walls of the temple of the
Dioscuri he painted the Rape of the Leucippidae, and set a precedent for
his art by portraying the women in transparent drapery. The Amphictyonic
Council was not shocked; it invited Polygnotus to Delphi, where, in the
Lesche, or Lounge, he painted Odysseus in Hades, and another Sack of
Troy. All these were vast frescoes, almost empty of landscape or
background, but so crowded with individualized figures that many
assistants were needed to fill in with color the master’s carefully
drawn designs. The Lesche mural of Troy showed Menelaus’ crew about to
spread sail for the return to Greece; in the center sat Helen; and
though many other women were in the picture, all appeared to be gazing
at her beauty. In a comer stood Andromache, with Astyanax at her breast;
in another a little boy clung to an altar in fear; and in the distance a
horse rolled around on the sandy beach.“</p></li>

<li><p>blow by blow he removes the superfluous until the perfection that
he has con- ceived takes shape in the stone, and, in Aristotle’s phrase,
matte r becomes form.</p></li>
<li><p>But his count ry’s mythology is still the leading inspiration of
his art. That terrible conflict between philosophy and religion which
runs through the thought of the fifth century does not show yet on the
monuments; here the gods are still supreme; and if they are dying they
are nobly transmuted into the poetry of art. Does the sculptor who
shapes in bronze the powerful 2.eus of Artemisiumf really hglieve that
he is model- ing the Law of the World? Does the artist who carves the
gentle and sor- rowful Dionysus of the Delphi Museum know, in the depths
of his inarticu- late understanding, that Dionysus has been shot down by
the arrows of philosophy, and that the traditional features of Dionysus’
successor, Christ, are already previsioned in this head?</p></li>
<li><p>At Ephesus he joined in a competition with Pheidias, Cresilas,
and Phradmon to make an Amazon for the temple of Artemis; the four
artists were made judges of the result; each, the story goes, named his
own work best, Polycleitus’ second be st; and the prize was given to the
Sicyonian.f“ But Polycleitus loved athletes more than women or gods. In
the famous Diadumenos (of which the best surviving copy is in the Athens
Museum) he chose for representation that moment in which the victor
binds about his head the fillet over which the judges are to place the
laurel wreath. The chest and abdomen are too muscular for belief, but
the body is vividly posed upon one foot, and the features are a
definition of classic regularity. Regularity was the fetish of
Polycleitus; it was his life aim to find and establish a canon or rule
for the correct proportion of every part in a statue; he was the
Pythagoras of sculpture, seeHng a divine mathe- matics of symmetry and
form. The dimensions of any part of a perfect body, he thought, should
bear a given ratio to the dimensions of any one part, say the index
finger. The Polycleitan canon called for a round head, broad shoulders,
stocky torso, wide hips, and short legs, making all in all a</p></li>
<li><p>We have perhaps an echo of its majesty in the noble head of Juno
in the British Museum^ reputed to be a copy from Polycleitus.</p></li>
<li><p>The wonder of the male frame is here complete: the body carefully
studied in all those movements of muscle, tendon, and bone that are
involved in the action; the legs and arms and trunk bent to give the
fullest force to the throw; the face not dis- torted with effort, but
calm in the confidence of ability; the head not heavy or brutal, but
that of a man of blood and refinement, who could write books if he would
condescend. This chef- d’oeuvre was only one of Myron’s achievements;
his contemporaries valued it, but ranked even more highly his Athena and
Marsyas^ and his Ladas. Athena here is too lovely for the purpose; no
one could guess that this demure virgin is watching with calm content
the flaying of the defeated flutist. Myron’s Marsyas is George Bernard
Shaw caught in an unseemly but eloquent pose; he has played for the last
time, and is about to die; but he will not die without a speech. Ladas
was an athlete who succumbed to the exhaustion of victory; Myron por-
trayed him so realistically that an old Greek, seeing the statue, cried
out: “Like as thou wert in life, O Ladas, breathing forth thy pa nting
soul, such</p></li>
<li><p>§ “ Another was the Athene Promachos, a colossal bronze
representation of the goddess as the warlike defender of her city; it
stood between the Propylaea and the Erechtheum, rose with its pedestal
to a height of seventy feet, and served as a beacon to mariners and a
warning to enemies.! The most famous of the three, the Athene Parthenos,
stood thirty-eight feet high in the interior of the Parthenon, as the
virgin goddess of wisdom and chastity. For this culminating figure
Pheidias wished to use marble, but the people would having nothing less
than ivory and gold. The artist used ivory for the visible body, and
forty- four talents (2545 lbs.) of gold for the robe;“ furthermore, he
adorned it with precious metals, and elaborate rehefs on the helmet, the
sandals, and the shield. It was so placed that on Athena’s feast day the
sun would shine through the great doors of the temple directly upon the
brilliant drapery and pallid face of the Virgin. J</p></li>
<li><p>The work was listed among the Seven Wonders of the World, and all
who could afford it made a pilgrimage to see the incarnate god. Aemilius
Paullus, the Roman who conquered Greece, was struck with awe on seeing
the colossus; his expectations, he confessed, had been exceeded by the
reality.“ Dio Chrysostom called it the most beautiful image on earth,
and added, as Beethoven was to say of Beethoven’s music: “If one who is
heavy- laden in mind, who has drained the cup of misfortune and sorrow
in life, and whom sweet sleep visits no more, were to stand before this
image, he would forget all the griefs and troubles that befall the life
of man.”“ “The beauty of the statue,” said Quintilian, “even made some
addition to the received religion; the majesty of the work was equal to
the god.”“</p></li>
<li><p>® carved for the pediments powerful figures</p></li>
<li><p>Sculptors filled the pediments with statuary and the metopes with
reliefs, and ran a frieze above the inner columns at both ends. Painters
colored the moldings, the triglyphs, metopes, and frieze, and made
bright murals for an interior dimly lit by light shining through marble
tiles.!</p></li>
<li><p>Elegant reliefs (partly pre- served in the Athens Museum) adorned
the external balustrade with figures of winged Victories bringing to
Athens their far-gathered spoils. These Nikai are in the noblest style
of Pheidias, less vigorous than the massive god- desses of the
Parthenon, but even more graceful in motion, and more deli- cate and
natural in their protrayal of drapery. The Victory tying her</p></li>
<li><p>In the northern porch was a perfect portal, adorned with a
molding of marble flowers. In the cella was the primitive wooden statue
of Athena, which the pious believed had fallen from heaven; there, too,
was the great lamp whose fire was never extin- guished, and which
Callimachus, the Cellini of his time, had fashioned of gold and
embellished with acanthus leaves, like his Corinthian capitals. The
south portico was the famous Porch of the Maidens, or Caiyatids.t These
patient women were descended, presumably, from the basket bearers of the
Orient; and an early caryatid at Tralles, in Asia Minor, betrays the
Eastern — probably the Assyrian — origin of the form. The drapery is
superb, and the natural flexure of the knee gives an impression of ease;
but even these sub- stantial ladies seem hardly strong enough to convey
that sense of sturdy and reliable support which the finest architecture
gives. It was an aberra- tion of taste that Pheidias would probably have
forbidden.</p></li>
<li><p>These columns, rather than those of the Parthenon, set the style
for later architecture. The foot of each was modulated into the
stylobate by an “Attic base” of three members, articulated by iUlets or
bands. The top of the column was graduated into the voluted capital by a
band of flowers. The entablature had a richly decorated molding, a
frieze of black stone, and, under the comice, a series of reliefs. The
egg-and-dart and honeysuckle orna- ment of the molding was as carefully
carved as the sculpture; the artists were paid as much for a foot of
such molding as for a figure in the frieze.“</p></li>
<li><p>The naming of the Parthenon figures is mostly
conjectural.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parthenon, like the Erechtheum and the Theseum, was preserved
through its use as a Christian church; it needed no great change of
name, being in each case dedicated to the Virgin. After the Turkish
occupation in 1456 it was transformed into a mosque, and acquired a
minaret. In 1687, when the Venetians besieged Athens, the Turks used the
temple to store each day’s supply of powder for their artillery. The
Venetian commander, so informed, ordered his gunners to fire upon the
Parthenon. A shell pierced the roof, exploded the powder, and laid half
the building in ruins. After capturing the city Morosini tried also to
take the pediment statuary, but his workmen dropped and smashed the
figures in lowering them. In 1800 Lord Elgin, British ambassador to
Turkey, secured permission to remove a part of the sculptures to the
British Museum, on the ground that they would be safer there than at
Athens against weather and war. His spoils included twelve statues,
fifteen metopes, and fifty- six slabs of the frieze. The Museum’s expert
on sculpture advised against buying this material; it was only after ten
years of negotiations that the Museum agreed to pay 75,000 for them,
which was less than half what Lord Elgin had spent in securing and
transporting them.” A few years later, during the Greek War of
Independence (1821 -1830), the Acropolis was twice bombarded, and much
of the Erechtheum was destroyed.” Some metopes of the Parthenon are
still in place; a few slabs of the frieze are in the Athens Museum, and
a few others in the Louvre. The citizens of Nashville, Tennessee, have
built a replica of the Parthenon, in the same dimensions as the
original, with like materials, and, so far as our knowledge goes, with
the same decorations and coloring; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art
contains a small hypothetical reproduction of the interior.</p></li>
<li><p>But no faults can outweigh the fact that Greek art created the
classic style. The essence of that style — if the theme of this chapter
may be restated in closing — is order and form: moderation in design,
expression, and decora- tion; proportion in the parts and unity in the
whole; the supremacy of rea- son without the extinction of feeling; a
quiet perfection that is content with simplicity, and a sublimity that
owes nothing to size. No other style but the Gothic has had so much
influence; indeed, Greek statuary is still the ideal, and until
yesterday the Greek column dominated architecture to the discouragement
of more congenial forms. It is good that we are freeing ourselves from
the Greeks; even perfection becomes oppressive when it will not change.
But long after our liberation is complete we shall find in- struction
and stimulus in that art which was the life of reason in form, and in
that classic style which was the most characteristic gift of Greece to
mankind.</p></li>

<li><p>At Thebes Philolaus the Pythagorean deposed the earth from the
center of the universe, and reduced it to the status of one among many
planets revolving about a “central fire.’” Leucippus, pupil of
Philolaus, attributed the origin of the stars to the in- candescent
combustion and concentration of material “drawn onward in the universal
movement of the circular vortex.”” At Abdera Democritus, pupil of
Leucippus and student of Babylonian lore, described the Milky Way as a
multitude of small stars, and summarized astronomic history as the
periodical collision and destruction of an infinite number of worlds.”

rotation sorted the seeds into the four elements— fire, air, water, and

<li><p>The sun and the stars are glowing masses of rock: “The sun is a
red -hot mass many times larger than the Peloponnesus.”“ When their
revolving motion wanes, the stones of the outer layer fall upon the
earth as meteors.“ The moon is an incandescent solid, having on its
surface plains, mountains, and ravines” it receives its light from the
sun, and is of all heavenly bodies the nearest to the earth.” “The moon
is eclipsed through the interposition of the earth . . . the sun through
the interposition of the moon.”” Probably other celestial bodies are
inhabited like the earth; upon them “men are formed, and other animals
that have life; the men dwell in cities, and cultivate fields as we
do.”” Out of the inner or gaseous layer of our planet successive
condensations pro- duced clouds, water, earth, and stones. Winds are due
to rarefactions of the atmos phere produced by the heat of the sun;
“thunder is caused by the collision of clouds, and lightning by their
friction.”” The quantity of matter never changes, but all forms begin
and pass away; in time the moun- tains will become the sea.” The various
f orms and objects of the world are brought into being by increasingly
definite aggregations of homo- geneous parts {homoiomerid) “ All
organisms were originally generated out of earth, moisture, and heat,
and thereafter from one another.” Man has developed beyond other animals
because his erect posture freed his hands for grasping things.”</p></li>
<li><p>As twelve lunar months made only 360 days, a thirteenth month was
added every second year to bring the calendar into harmony with the sun
and the seasons.® Since this made the year ten days too long, Solon
introduced the custom of having alternate months of twenty-nine and
thirty days, arranged into three weeks (dekades) of ten (occasionally
nine) days each;® and as an excess of four days still remained, the
Greeks omitted one month every eighth year. In this incred- ibly devious
way they at last arrived at a year of 365 K days.J</p></li>

its treatment for dislocations of shoulder or jaw are “modem” in

Asclepius at Athens shows a folding case containing scalpels of various
forms.“ The little museum at Epidaurus has preserved for us ancient
forceps, probes, scalpels, catheters, and specula essentially like those
that are used today; and certain statues there are apparently models
illustrating methods for reducing dislocations of the hip.“ The
Hippocratic treatise “On the Physician” gives detailed directions for
the preparation of the operating room, the arrangement of natural and
artificial light, the cleanliness of the hands, the care and use of
instruments, the position of the patient, the bandaging of wounds,,
etc.“ It is clear from these and other passages that Greek medicine in
Hippoc- rates’ days had made great advances, technically and socially.

<li><p>When, in 432, a war of swords was added to the war of words, the
excitement of the Athenian mind be- came a fever in which all soberness
of thought and judgment was consumed. The fever subsided for a time
after the martyrdom of Socrates, or was dissipated from Athens to other
centers of Greek life; even Plato, who had known the very height and
crisis of it, became exhausted after sixty years of the new game, and
envied Egypt the inviolable orthodoxy and quiet stability of its
thought. No age until the Renaissance would know such enthusiasm
again.</p></li>
<li><p>The mysterious problem of knowledge, the distinction between
noumenon and phenomenon, between the unseen real and the unreal seen,
was flung into the caldron of European thought, and was to boil or
simmer there through Greek and medieval days until, in Kant, it would
explode again in a philosophical revolution.</p></li>
<li><p>as if to say that for us things exist only in so f ar as we are
conscious of them. Beginning and end, birth and death, forma- tion and
destruction, are of forms only; the One Real never begins and never
ends; there is no Becoming, there is only Being. Motion, too, is un-
real, it assumes the passage of something from where it is to where
there is nothing, or empty space; but empty space. Not Being, cannot be;
there is no void; the One ffls every nook and cranny of the world, and
is forever at rest.t</p></li>

contemporaries gave him the very name of Wisdom (sophia).“ His range was
as wide as Anstotle’s, his style as highly praised as Plato’s.“ Francis
Bacon, in no perverse mo - ment, called him the greatest of ancient
philosophers.“</p></li>
<li><p>Hence the sense s give us only obscure knowledge, or opinion;
genuine knowledge comes only by investigation and thought. “Verily, we
know nothing. Truth is buried deep. . . . We know nothing for certain,
but only the changes produced in our body by the forces that imp inge
upon it.”“ All sensations are due to atoms dis - charged by the object

Sophists, respected him, and described him as a man of high character.
In the Platonic dialogue that is named after him Protagoras makes a much
better showing than the argumentative young Socrates; here it is
Socrates who talks like a Sophist, and Protagoras who behaves like a
gentleman and a philosopher, never losing his temper, never jealous of
another’s brilli &lt;nce, never taking the argument too seriously, and
never anxious to speak. He admits that he undertakes to teach his pupils

hospitality and fees of many states he settled down in Thessaly, and had
the wisdom to consume most of his great fortune before his death.“ He
lived, as all authorities assure us, to at least one hundred and five;
and an cient writer tells us that “though Gorgias attained to the age of
one hun - dred and eight, his body was not weakened by old age, but to
the end of his life he was in sound condition, and his senses were those
of a youth.””</p></li>
<li><p>was a heady stimulus to thought, but an unsteadying blow to
character; the emphasis on knowledge raised the educational level of the
Greeks, but it did not develop intelli- gence as rapidly as it liberated
intellect. The announcement of the relativity of knowledge did not make
men modest, as it should, but disposed every man to consider himself the
measure of all things; every clever youth could now feel himself fit to
sit in judgment upon the moral code of his people, reject it if he could
not understand and approve it, and then be free to rationalize his
desires as the virtues of an emancipated soul. The distinc- tion between
“Nature” and convention, and the wi llingness of minor Sophists to argue
that what “Nature” permitted was good regardless of custom or law,
sapped the ancient supports of Greek morality, and en- couraged many
experiments in living. Old men mourned the passing of domestic
simplicity and fidelity, and the pursuit of pleasure or wealth unchecked
by religious restraints.”” Plato and Thucydides speak of think - ers and
public men who rejected morals as superstitions, and acknowledged no
right but strength. This unscrupulous individualism turned the logic and
rhetoric of the Sophists into an instrument of legal chicanery and
political demagogy, and degraded their broad cosmopolitanism into a cau-
tious reluctance to defend their country, or an unprejudiced readiness
to sell it to the highest bidder. The religious peasantry and the
conservative aristocrats began to agree with the common citizen of the
urban democracy that philosophy had become a danger to the
state.</p></li>
<li><p>He excused his ignorance of grammar on the ground that he could
not afford the fifty-drachma course of Prodi- cus, but only the
one-drachma course, which gave merely the rudiments.“</p></li>
<li><p>Aristotle continued the attack; he defined a Sophist as one who
“is only eager to get rich off his apparent wisdom ,’”” and accused
Protagoras of “promising to make the worse appear the better
reason.’’”</p></li>
<li><p>Recently discovered fragments of an Alcibiades written by
Aeschines of Sphettos, an immediate disciple of Socrates, tend to
confirm the portrait given in the earlier dialogues of Plato, and the
story of the philosopher’s attachment to Alcibiades.”® On the other
hand, Aristotle classes Xenophon’s Memorabilia and Banquet as forms of
fiction, imaginary conversations in which Socrates becomes, more often
than not, a mouthpiece for Xenophon’s ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>If Xenophon honestly played Eckermann to Socrates’ Goethe we can
only say that he has care - fully collected the master’s safest
platitudes; it is incredible that so virtuous a man should have upset a
civilization. Other ancient writers did not make the old sage into such
a saint; Aristoxenus of Tarentum, about 318, re- ported, on the
testimony of his father — who claimed to have known Socrates — that the
philosop her was a person without education, “ignorant and debauched”;”’
and Eupolis, the comic poet, rivaled his rival Aristophanes</p></li>
<li><p>Making due discount for polemic vitriol it is at least clear that
Socrates was a man, hated and loved beyond any other figure of his
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Efis mother was a midwife: it was a standing joke with him that
he merely continued her trade, but in the realm of ideas, helping others
to deliver themselves of their conceptions. One tradition describes him
as the son of a slave it is improbable, for he served as a hoplite (a
career open only to citizens), inherited a house from his father, and
had seventy minas (000) invested for him by his friend Cri to;’” for the
rest he is represented as poor.”</p></li>
<li><p>At home, when he condescended to stay there, he worked as a
stonecutter and statuary. He had no interest in travel, and seldom went
outside the city and its port. He married Xanthippe, who berated him for
neglecting his family; he recognized the justice of her
complaint,”</p></li>
<li><p>its spacious spread, its flat, broad nose, its thick lips, and
heavy beard suggest rather Solon’s friend of the steppes, Anacharsis, or
that modern Scyt hian, Tolstoi. “I say,” Alcibiades insists, even while
protesting his love, “that Socrates is exactly like the masks of
Silenus, which may be seen sitting in the statuaries’ shops, having
pipes and flutes in their mouths; and they are</p></li>
<li><p>” He was incredibly free from the acquisitive fever that agitates
mankind. Viewing the multitude of arti- cles exposed for sale in the
market place, he remarked, “How many things there are that I do not
want!”</p></li>
<li><p>He was no recluse; he liked good company, and let the rich
entertain him now and then; but he made no obeisance to them, could get
along very well without them, and rejected the gifts and invitations of
magnates and kings.</p></li>
<li><p>” Plato speaks of Socrates and Alcibiades as lovers, and
describes the philoso- pher “in chase of the fair youth.”</p></li>
<li><p>” He gallantly prom - ised his help to the courtesan Theodota,
who rewarded him with the invi- tation: “Come often to see me.”</p></li>
<li><p>’ His good humor and kindliness were so unfailin g that those who
could stomach his politics found it simple to put up with his morals.
When he had passed away Xenophon spoke of him as “so just that he
wronged no man in the most trifling affair … so temperate that he never
preferred pleasure to virtue; so wise that he never erred in distin-
guishing better from worse … so capable of discerning the character of
others, and of exhorting them to virtue and honor, that he seemed to be
such as the best and happiest of men would be.”</p></li>

suspect that men’s bodies fare like those of plants. . . . When God
gives the plants water in floods to drink they cannot stand up straight
or let the breezes blow through them; but when they drink only as much
as they enj oy they grow up straight and tall, and come to full and
abundant fruitage.”“</p></li>
<li><p>So he went prowling among men’s beliefs, prodding them with
questions, demanding precise an swers and consistent views, and making
himself a terror to all who could not think clearly. Even in Hades he
proposed to be a gadfly, and “find out who is wise, and who pretends to
be wise and is not.’”</p></li>
<li><p>He protected himself from a similar cross-examination by
announcing that he knew nothing; he knew all the questions, but none of
the answers; he modestly called himself an “amateur in philosophy.’”“
What he meant, presumably, was that he was certain of nothing except
man’s fallibility, and had no ha rd and fast system of dogmas and
principles. When the oracle at Delphi, to Chaerephon’s alleged inquiry,
“Is any man wiser than Socrates?” gave the alleged reply, “No one,’”“
Socrates ascribed the response to his profession of ignorance.</p></li>
<li><p>’ To every vague notion, easy generali - zation, or secret
prejudice he pointed the challenge, ‘What is it?” and asked for precise
definitions. It became his habit to rise early and go to the mar- ket
place, the gymnasiums, the palaestras, or the workshops of artisans, and

<li><p>“ Indeed, he was often a Sophist in the modem sense: he was rich
in crafty dodges and argumentative tricks, slyly changed the scope or
meaning of terms, drowned the problem in loose analogies, quibbled like
a schoolboy, and</p></li>
<li><p>” The Athenians might be excused for giving him hemlock, since
there is no pest like a conscious logician. In four points he differed
from the Sophists; he despised rhetoric, he wished to strengthen
morality, he did not profess to teach anything more than the art of
examining ideas, and he refused to take pay for his instruction — though
he appears to have accepted occasional help from his rich
friends.</p></li>
<li><p>”</p></li>
<li><p>” Usually he is pictured as teaching wherever he found a pupil or
a listener. But no common doctrine united his followers; they differed
so widely among themselves that they became the leaders of the most
diverse philosophical schools and theories in Greece — Platonism, Cyni-
cism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism. There was the proud and humble
Antisthenes, who took from his master the doctrine of simplicity in life
and needs, and founded the Cynic school; perhaps he was present when
Socrates said to Antiphon: “You seem to think that happiness consists in
luxury and extravagance; but I think that to want nothing is to resemble
the gods, and that to want as little as possible is to make the nearest
approach to the gods.”</p></li>
<li><p>” There was the restless Xenophon who, though he gave up
philosophy for soldiering, testified that “nothing was of greater
benefit than to associate with Socrates, and to converse with him, on
any occasion, on any subject whatever.”</p></li>
<li><p>’“ “Socrates,” says Anytus, “I think you are too ready to speak
evil of men; and if you Wl take my advice, I would recommend you to be
careful. Perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men
harm than to do them good; and this is cert ainly the case at Athens.”””
Anytus bided his time.</p></li>
<li><p>He professed to follow, in all important negative decisions, an
inner daimonion which he described as a sign from heaven. Perhaps this
spirit was another play of the Socratic irony; if so, it was remarkably
well sustained; and it is but one class of many appeals, in S ocrates,
to oracles and dreams as messages from the gods.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sophists had also “turned around” from natural science to
man, and had begun the study of sensation, perception, and knowledge;
Socrates went further inward to study human character and purpose. “Tell
me, Euthydemus, have you ever gone to Delphi?” “Yes, twice.” “And did
you observe what is written on the temple wall — Know thyself?” “I did.”
“And did you take no thought of that inscription, or did you attend to
it, and try to examine yourself, and ascertain what sort of character
you are?’”</p></li>
<li><p>He condemns the litigiousness of the Athenians, their noisy envy
of one another, the bitterness of their political factions and disputes:
“On these accounts,” he says, “I am constantly in the greatest fear lest
some evil should happen to the state too great for it to
bear.”™</p></li>

Thebans soon concocted a story that told how once, as the young poet

their honey there.® Soon he was handsomely commissioned to write odes in
honor of princes and rich men; he was the guest of noble families in
Rhodes, Tenedos, 374</p></li>

sang in praise of mnners, courtesans, and kings, and was willing to
accept any promptly paying tyrant as a patron saint® if the occa- sion
gave scope to his rich imagination and his proudly intricate verse. His
topic might be anything from a mule race to the glory of Greek
civilization in all its variety and spread. He was loyal to Thebes, and
not more inspired than the Delphic oracle when he defended Theban
neutrality in the Persian War; but later he was ashamed of his error,
and went out of his way to praise the leader of the Greek defense as
“renowned Athens, rich, violet -crowned, worthy of song, bulwark of
Hellas, god- protected city.”</p></li>

turgid metaphors, and tiresome mythology, some curious scholars are

the new philosophy, which binds into one vast process of thought and

<li><p>From among many plays offered to the archon a few are selected
for performance. Each of the ten tribes or demes of Attica chooses one
of its rich citizens to serve as choragus, i.e., director of the chorus;
it is his privilege to pay the cost of training the singers, dancers,
and actors, and to meet the other expenses of presenting one of the
compositions. Sometimes a choragus spends a for- tune upon scenery,
costumes, and “talent”— in this way every play financed by Nicias
obtains a prize;“ some other choragi economize by hiring second - hand
robes from dealers in theatrical costumes.^ The actual training of the
chorus is usually undertaken by the dramatist himself.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no suspense and no surprise, but, instead, the pleasures
of anticipation and recognition. Dramatist after dramatist tells the
same tale to the same audience; what differs is the poetry, the music,
the interpretation, and the philosophy. Even the philosophy, before
Euripides, is determined in large measure by tradition:
throughout</p></li>
<li><p>He wrote seventy (some say ninety) dramas, of which seven remain.
Of these, the earliest</p></li>

Oresteia trilogy.</p></li>
<li><p>The Suppliant Women is of the primitive type, in which the chorus
predominates; The Persians is also mostly choral, and vividly describes
the battle of Salamis; the Seven against Thebes was the third play in a
trilogy that told the story of King Laius and his queen Jocasta, the
patricide and incest of their son Oedipus, and the conflict between the
sons of Oedipus for the Theban throne.</p></li>

hurl him down into Tartarus they stay by him, and face with him the
thunderbolt that blasts them and Prometheus into the abyss. But
Prometheus, being a god, is denied the easement of death. In the lost
conclusion of the trilogy he is raised up from Tartarus to be again
chained to a mountain rock, and a vulture is commissioned by Zeus to
gnaw out the Titan’s heart. The heart grows by night as fast as the
vulture consumes it by day; in this way Prometheus suffers through
thirteen generations of men. Then the kindly giant Heracles kills the
vulture, and persuades Zeus to free Prometheus. The Titan repents, makes
his peace with Omnipo- tence, and places upon his finger the iron ring
of necessity.</p></li>

world may be too subtle for us to understand it, it is there, and right

with this moral order, and comes even more closely to mono- theism. Like
a good Victorian he is uncertain of his theology, but strong in his
moral faith; the highest wisdom is to find that law which is Zeus, the
moral compass of the world, and follow it.</p></li>

his father, but Ion discovers that he is the son of Apollo, who seduced
his mother and then palmed her off on Xuthus; can it be. Ion asks, that

<li><p>His conclusion is stoicism: “Do thou endure as men must, chafing

he consoles himself with the thought that the spirit of man is part of
the divine Air or pneuma, and will, after death, be preserved in the
Soul of the World.”</p></li>
<li><p>“ He had excellent friends, including Protagoras and Socrates;
the latter, who ignored other dramas, said that to see a play by
Euripides he would walk to the Piraeus — a serious matter for a stout
philosopher. The younger generation of emancipated souls looked up to
him as their leader. But he had more enemies than any other writer in
Greek history. The judges, who felt themselves bound, presumably, to
protect rehgion and morals from his skeptical arrows, crowned only five
of his efforts with victory; even so it was liberal of the archon
basileus to admit so many Euripidean plays to a religious stage.
Conservatives in all fields looked upon the dramatist as responsible
with Socrates for the growth of unbelief among Athenian youth.
Aristophanes declared war upon him at the outset in The Acharnians,
satirized him with hilarious cari- cature in The Thesmophoriazusae, and,
in the year after the poet’s death, continued the attack in The Frogs;
nevertheless, we are told, the tragic and the comic dramatist were on
friendly terms to the end.“ As for the audi- ence, it denounced his
heresies and crowded to his plays. When, at line 612 of the Hippolytus,
the young hunter said, “My tongue hath sworn, but my mind remains
unbound,” the crowd protested so loudly against what seemed to be an
outrageously immoral proposition that Euripides had to rise in his seat
and comfort them with the assurance that Hippolytus would suffer

from sophistic skepticism to epicurean individualism, a basic danger to
the life of Athens. Perhaps Athens would have fared better if it had

of the dress, manners, morals, and beliefs of the societies he
describes. He tells us how Egyptian cats jump into the fire, how the
Danubians get drunk on smells, how the walls of Babylon were built, how
the Massagetae eat their parents, and how the priestess of Athena at

The “Funeral Oration” of Pericles is an excellent essay on the virtues
of Athens, and comes with fine grace from the pen of an exile; but Peri-

Plutarch spoils the romance by saying that Pericles left nothing

oracles rather than knowledge. He recognizes no guiding Providence, no
divine plan, not even “progress”; he sees life and history as a tragedy
at once sordid and noble, redeemed now and then by great men, but always
relapsing into superstition and war. In him the conflict between
religion and philosophy is decided; and philosophy wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of what we have comes from Athens; the other cities, as we
can tell from the philosophers that they sent to Athens, were fertile in
genius too, but their culture was sooner engulfed by barbarism from
without and from below, and their manuscripts were lost in the disorder
of revolution and war. We must judge the whole from the fragments of a

<li><p>The citizens were quick of mind and sharp of tongue; they enjoyed
good oratory to their ruin, and crowded to hear, in their magnificent

Aeschylus.</p></li>
<li><p>Athens defended this domination as a vital necessity; she was
dependent upon imported food, and was deter- mined to guard the routes
by which that food came. In policing the ave- nues of international
trade Athens performed a real service to peace and prosperity in the
Aegean, but the process became more and more irksome as the pride and

for defense against Persia were being used for the adorn- ment of
Athens, even for the financing of Athenian wars upon other

proposed that the eight victorious generals (in- cluding the son of
Pericles by Aspasia) should be put to death. Socrates, who happened to
be a member of the presiding prytany for the day, re- fused to put the
motion to a vote. It was presented and passed over his protests, and the
sentence was carried out with the same precipitation with which it had
been decreed. A few days later the Assembly repented, and condemned to

points with Xen ophon’s. Socrates, says Plato, insisted that he believed
in the state ^gods, even in the divinity of the sun and moon. “You say

demigods. … You might as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny

all Persian troops sent against him, he dispatched messengers with
abundant gold to Athens and Thebes to bribe these cities into declaring
war upon Sparta.“ The effort readily succeeded, and after nine years of
peace the conflict between Athens and Sparta was renewed. Agesilaus was
recalled from Asia to meet, and barely defeat, the combined forces of
Athens and Thebes at Coronea; but in the same month the united fleets of
Athens and Persia under Conon destroyed the Spartan navy near Cnidus,
and put an end to Sparta’s brief domina - tion of the seas. Athens
rejoiced, and set to work energetically, with funds supplied by Persia,
to rebuild her Long Walls. Sparta defended herself by sending an envoy,
Antalcidas, to the Great King, offering to surrender the Greek cities of
Asia to Persian rule if Persia would enforce among the mainlan d Greeks
a peace that would protect Sparta. The Great King agreed, withdrew his
financial support from Athens and Thebes, and com- pelled all parties to
sign at Sardis (387) the “Peace of Antalcidas,” or the “King’s Peace.”
Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros were conceded to Athens, and the major Greek
states were guaranteed autonomy; but all the Greek cities of Asia, along
with Cyprus, were declared the property of the King. Athens signed under
protest, knowing that this was the most disgraceful event in Greek
history. For a generation all the fruits of Marathon were lost; the
Greek states of the mainland remained free in name, but in effect the
power of Persia had engulfed them. All Greece looked upon Sparta as a
traitor, and waited eagerly for some nation to destroy her.</p></li>

believed, would please the refined ear as much as poetry. Out of this
school came many leaders of the Demosthenic age: Timotheus the general,
Ephorus and Theopompus the historians, Isaeus, Lycurgus, Hypereides, and
Aeschines the orators, Speusippus the successor of Plato, and, some say,

<li><p>It was felt first by the historians. Xenophon and others imitated
his sketch of Evagoras,t and biography became a popular form of Greek
literature, cul- minating in the gossipy masterpieces of Plutarch. To
one of his pupils, Ephorus of Cyme, Isocrates committed the task of
writing a general history of Greece — a record not of any one state, but
of Greece as a whole. Ephorus carried out the assignment so well that
his contemporaries ranked his Universal History with the books of
Herodotus. To another pupil, Theopompus of Chios, Isocrates committed
the field of recent events; Theopompus covered it in his Hellenica and
Philippica, lively and rhetorical works highly praised by his
contemporaries. About 340 Dicaearchus of Messana wrote a history of
Greek civilization under the title of Bios Hellados — The Life of

we can make out, belong most of the Niobid figures that came to Rome
from Asia Minor in the days of Augus- tus, and are now scattered among
the museums of Europe. And perhaps to this age must be assigned the
originals of three Aphrodites in the Praxit- elean tradition: the
hesitant Venus of Capua in the Naples Museum, the Vatican’s Crouching
Venus, and the modest Venus of Arles in the Louvre. Greater than these
in mature beauty and quiet depth of feeling is the seated Demeter found
at Cnidus in 1858, and now among the noblest fig- ures in the British
Museum. The subject is uncertain; perhaps it is merely the finest
funerary piece that has come down to us from antiquity; per- haps it
represents the com goddess as a mater dolorosa, silently mourning the
rape of Persephone. The emotion is conveyed with classic restraint; all
the tenderness of motherhood, and its silent resignation, are in the
face and eyes. This and the Hermes, and not those ingratiating
Aphrodites, are the living sculptural masterpieces of fourth-century

a half - humorous vein.” It is one of the playful ironies of history
that the philosophical works most reverenced and studied in European and
American universities today were composed in an attempt to make philoso-
phy intelligible to the layman by binding it up with a human
personality. It was not the first time that philosophical dialogues had
been written; Zeno of Elea and several others had used this method,” and
Simon of Ath - ens, a leather cutter, had published, in dialogue, a
report of the Socratic conversations held in his shop.” It was in Plato
a literary, not an historical, form; he did not pretend to give accurate
accounts of conversations held thirty or fifty years before, nor even to
keep his references consistent. Gorgias, as well as Socrates, was
astounded to hear the words that the young dramatist- philosopher had
put into his mouth.” The Dialogues were writ - ten independently of one
another, and perhaps at long intervals; we must not be shocked by slips
of memory, much less by changes of view. There is no design unifying the
whole, except as the continuing search of a visibly developing mind for
a truth which it never finds.f</p></li>
<li><p>everything that geometry says of triangles, circles, squares,
cubes, spheres would remain true, and therefore “real,” even if there
had never been, and never would be, any such figures in the physical
world. Abstractions also are real in this sense; individual acts of
virtue have a brief existence, but virtue remains as a permanent reality
for thought, and an instrument of thought; so with beauty, largeness,
likeness, and so forth; these are as real to the mind as beautiful,
large, or like things are real to the sense.” Individual acts or things
are what they are by partaking of, and more or less realizing, these
perfect forms or Ideas. The world of science and philosophy is composed
not of individual things, but of Ideas;t“ his - tory, as distinct from
biography, is the story of man; biology is the science not of specific
organisms, but of life; mathematics is the study not of con- crete
things but of number, relation, and form independently of things and yet
as valid for all things. Philosophy is the science of Ideas.</p></li>

<li><p>Love is the pursuit of beauty, and has three stages, accord - ing
as it is love of the body, or of the soul, or of truth. Love of the
body, between man and woman, is legitimate as a means to generation,
which is</p></li>
<li><p>nevertheless this is a rudimentary form of love, unworthy of a
philosopher. Physical love between man and man, or woman and woman, is
unnatural, and must be suppressed as frustrating reproduc-
tion.“</p></li>
<li><p>This, and not fleshless affection between man and woman, is
“Platonic love”— the point at which the poet and the philosopher in
Plato merge in the passionate desire for understanding, an almost mystic
longing for the Beatific Vision of the law and structure and life and
goal of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Like a blue blood, he despises the plutocratic oli - garchy, “the
men of business . . . pretending never so mu ch as to see those whom
they have already ruined, inserting their sting — that is, their money —
into anybody else who is not on his guard against them, and recovering
the principal sum many times over: this is the way in which they make
drones and paupe rs to abound in the state.”“’ “And then democracy comes
into being, after the poor have conquered their opponents, slaughtering
some and banishing some, while to the remainder they give an equal share
of freedom and power.”““ The democrats turn out to b e as bad as the
pluto- crats: they use the power of their number to vote doles to the
people and offices to themselves; they flatter and pamper the multitudes
until liberty</p></li>

be tested again. Those that fail will become soldiers; they shall have
no private property, and shall not engage in business, but shall live in
a military communism. Those that pass the second test will now (and none
before) take up for five years the study of “divine philosophy’”” in all
its branches, from mathematics and logic to politics and law. At
thirty-five the survivors, with all their theory on their heads, will be

360 shall choose a Nocturnal Council of twenty-six, which shall meet at
night and legislate on all vital affairs.”</p></li>

<li><p>that unity of body and soul which had been the educated Greek
ideal of the sixth and fifth centuries; like a Christian ascetic he
calls the body the tomb of the soul. He takes from Pythagoras and
Orphism an Oriental faith in transmigration, karma, sin, purification,
and “release”; he adopts, in his last works, the other -worldly tone of
a con- verted and repentant Augustine. One would almost say that Plato
was not Greek if it were not for his perfect prose.</p></li>
<li><p>“ He was a poet possessed by imagination, allured by every whimsy
of thought, enthralled by the tragedy and comedy of ideas, flushed with
the intellectual excitement of the free mental life of Athens. But it
was his fate that he was a logician as well as a poet; that he was the
most brilliant reasoner of antiquity, subtler than Zeno of Elea or
Aristotle; that he loved philosophy more than he loved any woman or any
man; and that in the end, like Dostoevski’s Grand Inquisitor, he
concluded to a suppression of all free reasoning, a conviction that
philosophy must be destroyed in order that man may live. He himself
would have been the first victim of his Utopias.</p></li>
<li><p>“ Aristotle fled with Pythias to near-by Lesbos, and spent some
time there in studying the natural history of the island.</p></li>
<li><p>“ but he maintained to the end a tender devotion to the memory of
Pythias, and at his death asked that his bones be laid beside hers; he
was not quite the emotionless bookworm that one might picture from his
works. In 343 Philip, who prob ably had known him as a youth at Amyntas’
court, invited him to undertake the education of Alexander, then a wild
lad of thirteen. Aristotle came to Pella and labored at the task for
four years. In 340 Philip commissioned him to direct the restoration and
repeopling of Stageirus, which had been laid waste in the war with
Olynthus, and to draw up a code of laws for it; all of which he
accomplished to the satisfac- tion of the city, which commemorated its
re-establishment by him in an annual holiday.</p></li>
<li><p>“ A sharp rivalry developed be- tween the Lyceum, whose students
were mostly of the middle class, the Academy, which drew its membership
largely from the aristocracy, and the school of Isocrates, which was
frequented chiefly by colonial Greeks. The rivalry was eased in time by
the emphasis of Isocrates on rhetoric, of the Academy on mathematics,
metaphysics, and politics, and of the Lyceum on natural science.
Aristotle set his pupils to gathering and co-ordinating knowledge in
every field: the customs of barbarians, the constitutions of the Greek
cities, the chronology of victors in the Pythian games and the Athe-
nian Dionysia, the organs and habits of animals, the character and
distri- bution of plants, and the history of science and philosophy.
These re- searches became a treasury of data upon which he drew,
sometimes too confidently, for his varied and innumerable
treatises.</p></li>
<li><p>These dialogues were among the casual - ties of the barbarian
conquest of Rome. What remains to us is a mass of technical, highly
abstract, and inimitably dull works rarely referred to by ancient
scholars, and apparently composed, in the last twelve years of his life,
of notes made for his lectures by himself, or from his lectures by his
pupils. These technical compendiums were not known outside the Lyceum
until they were published by Andronicus of Rhodes in the first century
B.c.““ Forty of them survive, but Diogenes Laertius mentions 360 more—
probably brief monographs. In these ashes of scholarship we must seek
the once living thought that in later ages won for Aristotle the title
of The Philosopher. We must approach him expecting no brilliance like
Plato’s and no wit like Diogenes’, but only a rich argosy of knowledge,
and such conservative wisdom as befits the friend and pensioner of
kings.</p></li>
<li><p>He exposes the fallacies into which sophists fall or lure us. He
criticizes his predecessors for having drawn the universe, or their
theories of it, out of their heads, instead of devoting themselves to
patient observation a nd experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>With all his errors he is the father of scientific method, and
the first man known to have organized co-operative scientific
research.</p></li>
<li><p>” He feels, though he does nothing to solve, the problems that
were to arouse Newton — inertia, gravity, motion, velocity; he has some
idea of the parallelogram of forces, and states the law of the lever:
“The moving weight will more easily move” (the object) “the farther away
it is from the fulcrum.”</p></li>
<li><p>8 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p></li>
<li><p>Alexander gave orders to his hunters, gamekeepers, fishermen, and
others to supply Aristotle with whatever species and information he
might request. The philosopher apologizes for his interest in lowly
things: “In all natural objects there lies some marvel, and if any one
despises the contemplation of the lower ani- mals, he must despise
himself.’””</p></li>
<li><p>The female el ement contributes to the embryo material and food,
the male element contributes energy and movement; the female is the
passive element, the male is the activating agent.”</p></li>
<li><p>References in the History of Animals indicate that Aristotle
prepared a volume of ana- tomical sketches, and that some of them were
reproduced on the walls of the Lyceum; his text uses letters, in modern
style, to refer to various organs or points in the drawings.</p></li>

plants are created</p></li>
<li><p>not (like Plato) how to make men good, but how to make them
happy. All other things than happiness, he thinks, are sought with some
other end in v iew; happiness alone is sought for its own sake.’”
Certain things are neces - sary to lasting happiness: good birth, good
health, good looks, good luck, good reputation, good friends, good
money, and goodness.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtue is not an act but a habit of doing the right thing. At
first it has to be enforced by discipline, since the young cannot judge
wisely in these matters; in time that which was the result of compulsion
becomes a habit, “a second nature,” and almost as pleasant as
desire.</p></li>
<li><p>“Those who wish for an independent pleasure should seek it in
philosophy, for all other pleasures need the assistance of
men.””</p></li>
<li><p>It is a natural product, for “man is by nature a political
animal””</p></li>
<li><p>Aristotle divided them into three types: monarchy, aristocracy,
and timocracy — government respectively by power, by birth, and by
excel- lence. Any one of these forms may be good according to time,
place, and circumstance. “Though one form of government may be better
than oth - ers,” reads a sentence which every American should memorize,
“yet there is no reason to prevent another from being preferable to it
under particular conditions.””</p></li>
<li><p>” When the single ruler is good and able, monarchy is the best
form of government; when he is a selfish autocrat we have tyranny, which
is the worst form of government. An aristocratic government may be
beneficial for a time, but aristocracies tend to deteriorate. “Noble
character is now seldom found among those of</p></li>
<li><p>® When aristocracy decays it is usually replaced by a plutocratic
oligarchy, which is government by wealth. This is better than the
despotism of a king or a mob; but it gives power to men whose souls have
been cramped by the petty calculations of trade, or the villainous
taking of interest,</p></li>
<li><p>™ When a democracy is dom - inated by the lower classes the rich
are taxed to provide funds for the poor. “The poor receive it and again
want the same supply, while the giving it is like pouring water into a
sieve.”™ And yet a wise conservative will not let people starve. “The
true patriot in a democracy ought to take care that the majority are not
too poor … he should endeavor that they may enjoy perpetual plenty; and
as this is also advantageous to the rich, what can be saved out of the
public money should be divided among the poor in such quantity as may
enable each of them to buy a l ittle field.”™</p></li>

speculation suggests the fertility of his ideas and the depth of his
insight. His treatises on ethics and politics stand above every rival in
fame and influence. When all deductions have be en made he still remains
“the master of those who know,” an encouraging testimony to the elastic
range of the human in - tellect, and a comforting inspiration to those
who labor to bring man’s scattered knowledge together into perspective
and understanding.</p></li>

century so denuded of topsoil that their ancient farms were abandoned.
The for- ests of Greece were vanishing, and timber, like food, had to be

married her, and had by her two sons. He was a plain, blunt soldier,
capable both of generous feeling and of realistic thinking. While other
inheritors of Alexander’s realm spent half their lives in war, and
dreamed of undivided sovereignty, Ptolemy devoted himself to con-
solidating his position in an alien country, and to promoting Egyptian
agriculture, commerce, and industry. He built a great fleet, and made
Egypt as secure against naval attack as nature had made it almost
unassail- able by land. He helped Rhodes and the Leagues to preserve
their inde- pendence of Macedon, and so won the title of Soter. Only
when, after eighteen years of labor, he had firmly organized the
political and economic life of his new realm did he call himself king
(305). Through him and his successor Greek Egypt established its rule
over Gyrene, Crete, the Cy- clades, Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, Phoenicia,
Samos, Lesbos, Samothrace, and the Hellespont. In his old age he found
time to write astonishingly truth- ful commentaries on his campaigns,
and to establish, about 290, the Mu- seum and Library that were to make
the fame of Alexandria. In 285, feeling his eighty-two years, he
appointed his second son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, to the throne, yielded

style. Dur- ing his long reign Alexandria became the literary apd
scientific capital of the Mediterranean, and Alexandrian literature
flourished as it would never do again. Nevertheless Philadelphus was
unhappy in his old age; his gout and his cares increased with the extent
of his wealth and his power. Look- ing out from his palace window he saw

filled the cosmopolitan capital with a busy, talkative, litigious crowd
of shopkeepers and traders, always on the alert for a bargain, and with
no prejudice in favor of honesty. At the top were the Macedonians and
the Greeks, liv- ing in such luxury as astonished the Roman ambassadors
who were ap- pointed to the court in 273. Athenaeus recounts the
delicacies that bur- dened the tables and digestions of the master
class,” and Herodas writes: “Alexandria is the house of Aphrodite, and
everything is to be found there — wealth, playgrounds, a large army, a
serene sky, public displays, philosophers, precious metals, fine young
men, a good royal house, an academy of science, exquisite wines, and
beautiful women.”” Alexandria’s poets were discovering the literary
value of virginity, and its novelists would soon make it the theme and
final casualty of many a tale; but the city was notorious for the
generosity of its women and the number of its stepdaughters of joy;
Polybius complained that the finest private homes in Alexandria belonged
to courtesans.“ Women of all classes moved freely through the streets,
shopped in the stores, and mingled with the men. Some of them made a
name for themselves in literature and scholarship.“ The Macedonian
queens and ladies of the court, from Ptolemy IPs Arsinoe to Antony’s
Cleopatra, took an active part in politics, and served policy rather
than love with their crimes; but they retained sufficient charm to
arouse the men to unprecedented gallantry, at least in poetry and prose,
and brought into Alexandrian society an element of feminine influence
and grace un- known in classic Greece.</p></li>

which Attalus first dedi- cated in his capital to celebrate his repulse

Athens, and perhaps to spread his fame, Attalus presented marble

Fragmentary marble copies have survived in The Dying Gaul of the
Capitoline Museum, in the miscalled Paetus and Arria^ — ?i Gaul who,
preferring death to capture, kills first his wife and then himself — and
in several smaller pieces now scattered through Egypt and Europe.
Perhaps to the same group belongs a Dead Amazon^ impeccably molded in
every detail except the incredibly per- fect breasts. These figures show
a classic restraint in the expression of emotion; the conquered men
suffer the extremes of pain and grief, but die without opera; and the
conquerors have allowed the artists to portray the virtues, as well as
the defeat, of their enemies. There is no sign here of any falling off
in power of conception, accuracy of anatomical observation, or skill and
patience of tech- nique. Almost as perfect is the great relief that ran
along the base of the Altar of Zeus on the Acropolis of Pergamum, and
told again the story of the war be- tween the gods and the giants —
presumably a modest allegory for Pergamenes and Gauls. The work is
overcrowded, and sometimes theatrically violent; but some figures stand
out as in the best tradition of Greek art. The headless Xeus is carved

children and peasants, in characterful features like those of Socrates,
in bitter old men like Demos- thenes, in powerful, almost brutal faces
like that of Euthydemus the Greco- Bactrian king, in desolate derelicts
like the Old Market Woman of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; they
recognized and relished the variety and complexity of life. They did not
hesitate to be sensual; they were not parents anxious about the chastity
of their daughters, nor phil- osophers disturbed by the social
consequences of an epicurean individual- ism; they saw the charms of the
flesh, and carved them into a beauty that might for a while laugh at
wrinkles and time. Freed from the conventions of the classic age, they
indulged themselves in tender sentiment, and pic- tured, possibly with
sincere feeling, shepherds dying of undisillusioned love, pretty heads
lost in romantic reverie, mothers fondly contemplating their children:
these, too, seemed to them a part of the reality they would record. And
finally they faced the facts of pain and grief, of tragic catastrophes
and untimely death; and they resolved to find a place for them in their

then postulates or necessary assumptions, then “common notions” or
axioms. Following Plato’s injunctions, he confined himself to such
figures and proofs as needed no other instruments than ruler and
compasses. He adopted and perfected a method of progressive exposition
and demonstration already familiar to his predecessors: proposition,
diagrammatic illustration, proof, and conclu- sion. Despite minor flaws
the total result was a mathematic^ architecture that rivaled the
Parthenon as a symbol of the Greek mind. Actually it outlived the
Parthenon as an integral form; for until our own century the Elements of
Euclid constituted the accepted textbook of geometry in nearly every
European uni- versity. One must go to the Bible to find a rival for it
in enduring influence.</p></li>

<li><p>sometimes he made strange mechanisms to study the principles on
which they operated. But his perennial interest and delight lay in pure
science conceived as a key to the understanding of the universe rather
than as a tool of practical construction or expanding wealth. He wrote
not for pupils but for professional scholars, communi- cating to them in
pithy monographs the abstruse conclusions of his research. All later
antiquity was fascinated by the originality, depth, and clarity of these
treatises. “It is not possible,” said Plutarch, three centuries later,
“to find in all geometry more difficult and intricate questions, or more
simple and lucid explanations. Some ascribe this to his natural genius;
others think that these easy and unlabored pages were the result of
incredible effort and toU.’”</p></li>
<li><p>In a lost treatise partly preserved in summaries, Archimedes so
accurately formulated the laws of the lever and the balance that no
advance was made upon his work until A.D. 1 586. “Commensurable
magnitudes,” said Proposition VI, “will balance at distance s inversely
proportional to their gravities”’— a useful truth whose brilliant
simplification of complex relationships moves the soul of a scientist as
the Hermes of Praxiteles moves the artist. Almost intoxicated with the
vision of power which he saw in the lever and the pulley, Archimedes an-
nounced that if he had a fixed fulcrum to work with he could move any-
thing: “Pa bo, kai tan gan kino^’ he is reported to have said, in the
Doric dialect of Syracuse: “Give me a place to stand on, and I will mo
ve the earth.”’ Hieron challenged him to do as well as say, and pointed
to the difficulty which his men were experiencing in beaching a large
ship in the royal fleet. Archimedes arranged a series of cogs and
pulleys in such wise that he alone, sitting at one end of the mechanism,
was able to draw the fully loaded vessel out of the water onto the
land.”</p></li>
<li><p>“ Marcellus withdrew his fleet, and put his hopes in an attack by
land. But Archimedes bombarded the troops with large stones thrown by
catapults to such effect that the Romans fled, saying that they were
being opposed by gods; and they refused to ad- vance again.’</p></li>
<li><p>there is no hint of heliocentricism; on the contrary it assumes
that the sun and the moon move in circles about the earth. But

“hypothesis that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved; the earth
revolves about the sun in the circumference of a circle, the sun lyin g
in the middle of the orbit”;</p></li>
<li><p>and Plutarch reports that Cleanthes the Stoic held that
Aristarchus should be indicted for “putting the Hearth of the Universe”
(i.e., the earth) “in motion.”</p></li>
<li><p>Seleucus of Seleucia defended the heliocentric view, but th e
opinion of the Greek scientific world decided against it. Aristarchus
himself seems to have abandoned his hypothesis when he failed to
reconcile it with the supposedly circular movements of the heavenly
bodies; for all Greek astronomers took it for granted that these orbits
were circular. Perhaps a distaste for hemlock moved Aristarchus to be

<li><p>’TT THO is so worthless or indolent,” Polybius demands to know,
“as V V not to wish to understand by what means and under what system of
polity the Romans in less than fifty-three years have succeeded in sub-
jecting the whole inhabited world to their sole government — a thing
unique in history? Who is so passionately devoted to other studies as to
regard anything of greater moment than the acquisition of this
knowledge?’” It is a permissible inquiry, which may engage us later; but
there have been so many conquests since Polybius wrote that we cannot
spend much time on any of them. We have tried to show that the essential
cause of the Roman conquest of Greece was the disintegration of Greek
civilization from within. No great nation is ever conquered until it has
destroyed itself. Deforesta- tion and the abuse of the soil, the
depletion of precious metals, the migration of trade routes, the
disturbance of economic life by political disorder, the corruption of
democracy and the degeneration of dynasties, the decay of morals and
patriotism, the decline or deterioration of the population, the
replacement of citizen armies by mercenary troops, the human and
physical wastage of fratricidal war, the guillotining of ability by
murderous revo- lutions and counterrevolutions — all these had exhausted
the resources of Hellas at the very time when the little state on the
Tiber, ruled by a ruthless and farseeing aristocracy, was training hardy
legions of landowners, con- quering its neighbors and competitors,
capturing the food and minerals of the western Mediterranean, and
advancing year by year upon the Greek settlements in Italy. These
ancient communities, once proud of their wealth, their sages, and their
arts, had been impoverished by war, by the depredations of Dionysius I,
and by the growth of Rome as a rival center of trade. The native tribes
that, centuries before, had been enslaved by the Greeks or pushed back
into the hinterland, increased and multiplied while their masters
cultivated comfort through infanticide and abortion. Soon the native
stocks were contesting the control of southern Italy. The Greek cities
turned to Rome for help; they were helped, and absorbed.</p></li>
<li><p>In 295 Pyrrhus, who traced his ancestry to Achilles, became king
of the Molossians, the dominant Epirote tribe. He was handsome and
brave, a despotic but popular ruler. His subjects thought that he could
cure the spleen by pressing his right foot upon their prostrate backs;
nor was anyone so poor as to be refused his ministrations.“</p></li>
<li><p>it bequeathed itself in an incomparable legacy to the nations of
Europe and the Near East. Every Greek colony poured the elixir of Greek
art and thought into the cultural blood of the hinterland — into Spain
and Gaul, Etruria and Rome, Egypt and Palestine, Syria and Asia Minor,
and along the shores of the Black Sea. Alexandria was the port of
reshipment for ideas as well as goods: from the Museum and the Library
the works and views of Greek poets, mystics, philosophers, and
scientists were scattered through scholars and students into every city
of the Mediterranean concourse. Rome took the Greek heritage in its
Hellen- istic form; her playwrights adopted Menander and Philemon, her
poets imitated the modes, measures, and themes of Alexandrian
literature, her arts used Greek craftsmen and Greek forms, her law
absorbed the statutes of the Greek cities, and her later imperial
organization was modeled upon the Greco-Oriental monarchies: Hellenism,
after the Roman conquest of Greece, conquered Rome even as the Orient
was conquering Greece. Every extension of Roman power spread the ferment
of Hellenic civiliza- tion. The Byzantine Empire wedded Greek to Asiatic
culture, and passed on some part of the Greek inheritance to the Near
East and the Slavic north. The Syrian Christians took up the torch and
handed it to the Arabs, who carried it through Africa to Spain.
Byzantine, Moslem, and Jewish scholars conveyed or translated the Greek
masterpieces to Italy, arousing first the philosophy of the Schoolmen
and then the fever of the Renaissance. Since that second birth of the
European mind the spirit of Greece has seeped so thoroughly into modem
culture that “all civilized nations, in all that con - cerns the
activity of the intellect, are colonies of Hellas” today.</p></li>

<li><p>Hardships of transportation through mountains and forests
collaborated with the jealous pugnacity of men, here as in Greece, to
form independent city-states, seldom united against external foes; each
cherished its separate security, often stood aside while others were
attacked, and, one after another, succumbed to Rome. But through most of
the sixth century b.c. these allied municipalities constituted the
strongest political force in Italy, with a well-organized army, a famous
cavalry, and a powerful navy that for a time ruled what is still called
the Tyrrhene (i.e., Etruscan) Sea.f</p></li>
<li><p>But they did not follow up this brilliant method of covering
great spaces without a confusion of columns and an oppressive weight of
architraves. For the most part they walked in the grooves worn by the
Greeks, and left Rome to con- summate the arcuate revolution.</p></li>
<li><p>The three tribes — Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans — that dwelt on
the hills joined in</p></li>
<li><p>The census reported some 80,000 persons capable of bearing arms;
reckoning one woman and one child for each soldier, and a slave for
every fourth family, we may estimate at 260,000 the population of Rome
and its subject environs about 560 b.c. Servius divided the people into
thirty-five new tribes, arranging them according to place of residence
rather than kin- ship or rank; thereby, like Cleisthenes a generation
later in Attica, he weak- ened the political cohesion and voting power
of the aristocracy — the class that rated itself supreme by birth. When
another Tarquin, grandson of Tarquinius Priscus, charged Servius with
ruling illegally, he submitted him- self to a plebiscite and received,
says Livy, “a unanimous vote.” 42 Uncon - vinced, Tarquin had Servius
assassinated, and announced himself king.f Under Tarquinius Superbus
(“the Proud”) the monarchy became abso - lute, and Etruscan influence
supreme. The patricians had thought of the rex as the executive of the
Senate and chief priest of the national religion; they could not long
consent to unlimited royal power. Therefore they had killed Tarquinius
Priscus and had raised no hand to protect Servius. But this new Tarquin
was worse than the first. He surrounded himself with a bodyguard,
degraded freemen with months of forced labor, had citizens crucified in
the Forum, put to death many leaders of the upper classes, and ruled
with an insolent brutality that won him the hatred of all influential
men . 44 1 Think- ing to gain popularity by successful wars, he attacked
the Rutuli and the Volscians. While he was with the army the Senate
assembled and deposed him (508 b.c.), in one of the great turning points
of Roman history.</p></li>

<li><p>The coins of Rome, centuries before she had a fleet, were adorned
with the prow of a ship — long used in the coinage of Etruria to
symbolize her commercial activity and naval power. From the seventh to
the fourth centuries b.c. it was a custom among Roman aristocrats to
send their sons to Etruscan cities for higher education; there, among
other • In an Etruscan tomb at Vetulonia, dated back to the eighth
century b.c., a double -headed iron ax was found, with its shaft
enclosed by eight iron rods . 53 The double ax as a symbol of government
is at least as old as Minoan Crete. The Romans gave to the bound rods
and axes the name of fasces , bundles. The twelve lictors ( ligare, to
bind) owed their number to the twelve cities of the Etruscan Federation,
each of which provided a lictor for the chief officer of the Federation

<li><p>often abused its authority, defended cor- rupt officials, waged
war ruthlessly, exploited conquered provinces greedily, and suppressed
the aspirations of the people for a larger share in the pros- perity of
Rome. But never elsewhere, except from Trajan to Aurelius, have so much
energy, wisdom, and skill been applied to statesmanship; and never
elsewhere has the idea of service to the state so dominated a government
or a people. These senators were not supermen; they made serious
mistakes, sometimes vacillated in their policies, often lost the vision
of empire in the lust for personal gain. But most of them had been
magistrates, administrators, and commanders; some of them, as
proconsuls, had ruled provinces as large as kingdoms; many of them came
of families that had given statesmen or generals to Rome for hundreds of
years; it was impossible that a body made up of such men should escape
some measure of excellence. The Senate was at its worst in victory, at
its best in defeat. It could carry forward policies that spanned
generations and centuries; it could begin a war in 264 and end it in 146
b.c. When Cineas, the philosopher who had come to Rome as envoy of
Pyrrhus (280), had heard the Senate’s deliberations and observed its
men, he reported to the new Alexander that here was no mere gathering of
venal politicians, no haphazard council of mediocre minds, but in
dignity and statesmanship veritably “an assemblage of kings.”

nonsense and erotic banter — out of which Lucilius would forge a new

The unit of value was the as (one) — i.c., one pound of copper by

coinage was issued by the state, it often bore the image of an ox, a

When Etruria and Umbria were on the verge of going over to the rebels,
Rome pacified them by a grant of full Roman citizenship; and in 90 the
Roman franchise was offered to all Italian freemen or freedmen who would
swear fealty to Rome. These belated concessions weakened the allies; one
town after another laid down its arms; and in 89 this ferocious and
costly war ended in a sullen peace. The Romans nullified the franchise
they had granted by enrolling the new citizens in ten new tribes, which
voted only after the existing thirty-five, and therefore usually to no
use; besides, only a few of the new citizens could attend the assem-

<li><p>Rome wanted a metaphysic that ^ould exalt mystic powers rather
than natural law; an ethic that would make a virile and martial people
rather than humanitarian lovers of quiet and peace; and a political
philosophy that, like those of Virgil and Horace, would justify Rome’s
imperial mastery. In the resurrection of faith after Seneca, Lucretius
was almost forgotten. Not tillPoggio rediscovered him in 1418 did he
begin to influence European thought. A physician of Verona, Girolamo
Fracastoro (1483-1553) took from the poet the theory of disease as due
to noxious “seeds” ( sermna ) float - ing in the air; and in 1647
Gassendi revived the atomic philosophy. Voltaire read the De Rerum

<li><p>For a while he stayed in Rome, enjoying the life of an amused
spectator of the hurrying world. He mingled with all ranks, studying the
types that made up Rome, contemplating with clinical pleasure the
follies and vices of the capital. He pictured some of these types in two
books of Satires (34 and 30 B.c.) modeled at first on Lucilius and later
in a milder and more tolerant strain. He called these poems sermones —
not by any means sermons, but informal conversations, sometimes intimate
dialogues, in almost colloquial hexameters; he confessed that they were
prose in everything but meter, “for you would not call one a po et who
writes, as I do, lines more akin to prose.” In these racy verses we meet
the living men and women of Rome and hear them talking as Romans talked:
not the shepherds, peasants, and heroes of Virgil, nor the legendary
lechers and heroines of Ovid, but the saucy slave, the vain poet, the
pompous lecturer, the greedy philosopher, the gabbing bore, the eager
Semite, the businessman, the statesman, the streetwalker: this at last,
we feel, is Rome. With homicidal playfulness Horace lays down for the
hunter of legacies the rules for success in that ghoulish game. 29 He
laughs at the gourmets who feast on delicacies and limp with gout. 30 He
reminds the laudator temporis acti — the “praiser of times past”— that
“if some god were for taking you back to those days you would refuse
every time”; 31 the chief charm of the past is that we know we need not
live it again. He wonders, like Lucretius, at the restless souls who in
the city long for the country, and there long for the city; who can
never enjoy what they have because there is someone who has more; who,
not content with their wives, hanker with too great and yet too little
imagination for the charms of other women who have in turn become prose
to other men. Money-madness, he concludes, is the basic disease of Rome.
He asks the itching gold-seeker, “Why do you laugh at Tantalus, from
whose thirsty lips the water always moves away? Change the name, and the
story is about you”: vrutato nomine, de te fabula narratur 32 He
satirizes himself, too: he represents his slave telling him to his face
that he, the moralist, is hot-tempered, never knows his own mind or
purpose, and is the menial of his passions like anybody else. It is
doubtless to himself, as well as to others, that he recommends the
golden mean, aurea mediocritas; 83 est modus in rebus, he says —
“there’s a limit, a measure in things,” 34 which the intelligent man
will neither fall short of</p></li>
<li><p>more blessing than the lot of the dazzling lord of fertile
Africa.” 89 In him, as in the other Augustan poets, the lov e of country
life finds a warm expression rare in the literature of Greece. Beatus

plant these “sapphics” and “alcaics,” these iambics and
hendecasyllabics, into Roman lyric form, to express his thoughts on love
and wine, religion and the state, life and death, in stanzas
refreshingly new, epigrammatically com- pact, modeled for music, and
teasing the mind with the complex skein of their weaving. He did not
intend them for simple or hurried souls; indeed, he warned such away by

here the frankly utilitarian Roman with little taste for beauty apart
from use; we can understand him and admit that a city should have clean
water before it has Parthenons. Through these artless books we perceive

say Pliny and Strabo, 20 the art of glass blowing was brought from Sidon
or Alexandria to Rome, and soon produced polychrome phials, cups, bowls,
and other forms of such delicate beauty that they became for a time the
favorite prey of art collectors and millionaires. In Nero’s reign 6000
sesterces were paid for two small cups of blown glass now known as
millefiori, or “thousand flowers,” produce d by fusing together
differently colored glass rods. Even more prized were the “Murrhine”
vases imported from Asia and Africa. They were made by placing white and
purple glass filaments side by side to form a desired pattern, and then
firing them; or pieces of colored glass were embedded in a transparent
white body. Pompey brought some to Rome after his victory over
Mithridates; Augustus, though he melted down Cleopatra’s gold plate,
kept for himself her goblet of Murrhine glass. Nero paid a million
sesterces for one such cup; Petronius, dying, broke another lest it
should fall into Nero’s hands. All in all, the Romans have had no
superior in making glass; and there are few art collec- tions in the
world more precious than those of Roman glass in the British Museum and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p></li>

him. Augustus followed suit; but Tiberius, hostile to all foreign
faiths, conscripted 4000 of them for almost suicidal soldiering in
Sardinia, and expelled the rest from Rome (a.d. 19). 10 Twelve years
later, con- vinced that he had been misled in this matter by Sejanus, he
withdrew his edict and ordered that the Jews should be unmolested in the
practice of their religion and the pursuit of their customs. 17 Caligula
protected them in Rome and oppressed them abroad. Claudius exiled some
because of riots, but by a general edict (42 ) confirmed the right of
the Jews throughout the Empire to live by their own laws. In 94 Domitian
banished the Jews of Rome to the valley of Egeria; in 96 Nerva brought

behavior was excep - tional, and no worse than the braggart drunkenness
of American conven- tioneers. Pleasanter was the custom of presenting

the Romans magnified them until Ammianus d escribed citharas “as large

upon earlier ones chiefly in sonorousness and size. The strings of the
lyre were made of gut or sinew and numbered up to eighteen; they were
plucked with a plectrum or with the fingers — which alone could execute
the quicker runs. From Alexandria, early in the first century, came the
hydraulic organ, with several registers, stops, and orders of pipes.
Nero fell in love with it, and the calm Quintilian was impressed by its
versatility and power.</p></li>

<li><p>Jurisprudence- wisdom in the law — was defined in the Digest of
Justinian (a.d. 533) as both a science and an art: the “science of the
just and the unjust,” and the “art 〔i.e., administration〕 of the good
and the equitable.” 2 Ius included unwritten law, or custom, as well as
written law. The latter was composed of ius civile — the “law of
〔Roman〕 citizens”— and ius gentium — ’the law of the nations.” Civil
law was “public law” when it related to the state or the official
worship, and “private law” when it dealt with the legal interrelations
of the citizens.</p></li>
<li><p>The lex Poetelia (326 b.c.) modified this rule by allow- ing the
debtor to work off his obligation while retaining his freedom. After
Caesar, defaulted mortgages were usual ly satisfied by the sale of the
debtor’s property without jeopardy to his person; but cases of
enslavement to a creditor occur as late as Justinian. Commercial
defaults were mitigated by a law of bank- ruptcy which sold the
bankrupt’s property to pay hi s debts, but permitted him to keep as much
of his later acquisitions as his subsistence required.</p></li>

fell, transport was disorganized, floods destroyed great- quantities of

the beginning of Ma rcus’ reign vanished; men yielded to a be - wildered

<li><p>Lives of Illustrious Men ( 1 10) ; history is here degenerat- ing
into biography, and biography into anecdote; portents and miracles and
superstitions crowd the pages, and only the Elizabethan English of
Philemon Holland’s translation (1606) has raised the book to the level
of literature. Less disturbing is the descent from Pliny to the letters
of Fronto. Perhaps these were not meant for publication, and cannot be
fairly compared with Pliny’s; some were spoiled by a search for archaic
phraseology, but many are touched by real affection of the teacher for
his pupil. Aulus Gellius supported the archaizing movement in his Attic
Nights (169) — the largest collection of worthless trifles in ancient
literature; and Apuleius brought it to a climax in The Golden Ass.
Apuleius and Fronto came from Africa, and the fad may have had partial
source in the fact that written Latin there had departed less than in
Rome from the language of the people and the Republic. Fronto rightly
believed in strengthen- ing literature with popular speech, as one
freshens a plant by turning over the earth at its roots. But youth does
not come twice to a man, a nation, a literature, or a language.
Orientalization had set in and could not be stopped. The common Greek
tongue of the Hellenistic East and Oriental Rome was becoming the
language of literature as well as o f life; Fronto’s pupil chose it for
his Meditations. Appian, an Alexandrian Greek living at Rome, chose
Greek for his vivid Histories of Rome’s wars ( ca . 160); so did
Claudius Aelian, a Roman by birth and blood; a half century later Dio
Cassius, a Roman senator, would write his history of Rome in Greek.
Leadership in literature was passing back from Rome to the Greek East;
not to the Greek spirit, but to the Oriental soul using Hellenic speech.
There would be giants again in Latin; but they would be Christian
saints. Roman art declined more slowly than Roman letters. Technical
ability lin- gered on and produced good architecture, sculpture,
painting, and mosaic. The head of Nerva, in the Vatican, carries on the
vivid realism of Flavian portraits, and the Column of Trajan is an
impressive relief despite much crudity. Hadrian labored to revive
Hellenic classicism, but found no one to play Pheidias to his Pericles;
the inspiration that had stirred Greece after Marathon, and Rome after
Actium, was missing in an age of self-limitation, contentment, and
peace. The busts of Hadrian lose character by their smooth Hellenistic
lines; the heads of Plotina and Sabina are pretty; but the portraits of
Antinoiis repel us by their sleek effeminate insipidit y. Probably
Hadrian’s classical reaction was a mistake: it ended the forceful
naturalism and individuation of Flavian and Trajanic sculp- ture, which
had had indigenous roots in Italian tradition and character. Nothing
reaches maturity except through the fulfillment of its own
nature.</p></li>

Column of Aurelius which still adorns the Piazza Colonna; inspired by

Iranians, the custom of wearing breeches; to these they added tunics
dyed in many colors and embroidered with flowers, and striped cloaks
fastened at the shoulders. They loved jewelry and wore gold ornaments —
even if nothing else — in war . 24 They liked abundant meat, beer, and

some 6000 souls; but they had paved and drained streets, forums,
basilicas, temples, and houses with stone foundations and tiled roofs.
Viroconium (Wroxeter) had a basilica accommodating 6000 persons, and
public baths where hundreds could bathe at once. The hot springs of
Aquae Salis (“Salt Waters”), now Bath, made it a fashionable resort in
ancient days, as its surviving thermae show. Londinium rose to economic

instrument like the theodolite, and formulated principles for measuring,
by surveying, the distances to inaccessible points. In the Me- chanica
he considered the uses and combinations of simple devices like the
wheel, axle, lever, pulley, wedge, and screw. In the Pneumatica he
studied air pressure in seventy-eight experiments, most of them playful

part of the body. Mechanistic interpretations of biology had been
advanced by several physicians, as for example by Asclepiades, who held
that physiology should be treated as a branch of physics; Galen objected
that whereas a machine is merely the sum of its parts, an organism
implies the purposive control of the parts by the whole. And just as
purpose alone can explain the origin, structure, and function of organs,

credible that in so solemn a mome nt he should ask them to repeat this
supper periodically (as Jewish custom required), in commemoration of
him; and not improbable that, with Oriental intensity of feeling and
imagery, he asked them to think of the bread they ate as his body, and
of the wine they drank as his blood.</p></li>

Osiris, Attis, Dionysus — who had died to redeem mankind; such titles as
So ter (Savior) and Eleutherios (Deliverer) had been applied to these
deities; and the word Kyrios (Lord), used by Paul of Christ, was the
term given in Syrian-Greek cults to the dying and redeem- ing Dionysus.

<li><p>By comparing these diverse renderings, and using his knowledge of
Hebrew, Origen offered to the Church a corrected Septuagint. Insatiate,
he added commentaries, sometimes of great length, on every book in the
Bible. In Peri archon, “First Principles,” he achieved the first orderly
and philosophi - cal exposition of Christian doctrine. In a “Miscellany”
( Stromateis ) he undertook to demonstrate all Christian dogmas from the
writings of the pagan philosophers. To lighten his task he availed
himself of that allegorical method by which pagan philosophers had made
Homer accord with reason, and Philo had reconciled Judaism with Greek
philosophy. The literal mean- ing of Scripture, argued Origen, overlay
two deeper layers of meaning — the moral and the spiritual — to which
only the esoteric and educated few could penetrate. He questioned the
truth of Genesis as literally understood: he explained away as symbols
the unpleasant aspects of Yahveh’s dealings with Israel; and he
dismissed as legends such stories as that of Satan taking Jesus up to a
high mountain and offering him the kingdoms of the world. 03 Sometimes,
he suggested, scriptural narratives were invented in order to convey
some spiritual truth. 04 “What man of sense,” he asked,</p></li>
<li><p>Clement, stands out as the author of an extant letter written
about 9 6 to the church of Corinth, appealing to its members to maintain
harmony and order; 72 here, o nly a generation after Peter’s death, the
bishop of Rome speaks with authority to the Christians of a distant
congregation. The other bishops, while acknowledging the “primacy”of the
Roman bishop as the lineal successor of Peter, repeatedly challenged his
power to overrule their own decisions. The Eastern churches celebrated
Easter on the fourteenth day of the Jewish month of Nisan, whatever day
of the week this might be; the Western churches post- poned the feast to
the following Sunday. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, visiting Rome about
156, tried and failed to persuade Anicetus, Bishop of Rome, to have the
Eastern date observed in the West; and on his return he rejected the
Pope’s suggestion that the Eastern churches should accept the Western
datie. Pope Victor (190) rephrased Anicetus’ request as a command; the
bishops of Palestine obeyed, those of Asia Minor refused. Victor sent
out letters to the Christian congregations, excommunicating the
recalcitrant churches; many bishops, even in the West, protested against
so severe a measure, and apparently Victor did not insist.</p></li>
<li><p>To aid him in administering the spreading episcopate of Rome,
Zephyrinus raised to the archdeaconate a man whose intelligence was less
questioned than his morals. Callistus, said his enemies, had begun his
career as a slave, had become a banker, had embezzled the funds
deposited with him, had been sentenced to hard labor, had been released,
had started a riot in a synagogue, had been con- demned to the mines of
Sardinia, had escaped by having his name surreptitiously inserted into a
list of pardoned prisoners, and had then lived for ten years at Antium
in painful peace. When Zephyrinus placed him in charge of the papal
cemetery he transferred it to the Via Appia, in the catacomb that bears
his name. When Zephyrinus died, and Callistus was chosen pope,

<li><p>like Commodus, seemed made to prove that a man’s quota of energy
seldom allows him to be great in both his life and his seed. Attrac-
tive and obedient in boyhood, he became in manhood a barbarian
infatuated with hunting and war. He captured wild boars, fought a lion
singlehanded, kept lions always near him in his palace, and had one as
occasional table companion and bedfellow . 7 He particularly enjoyed the
company of gladi- ators and soldiers, and would keep senators cooling
their heels in his ante- chambers while he prepared food and drink for
his companions. Unwilling to share the imperial power with his brother,
he had Geta assassinated in 212; the youth was slaughtered in his
mother’s arms, and c overed her gar- ments with his blood. We are told
that Caracalla condemned to execution 20,000 of Geta’s following, many
citizens, and four Vestal Virgins whom he accused of adultery . 8 When
the army murmured at the killing of Geta, he silenced it with a donative
equal to all the sums that Septimius had gathered into all the
treasuries. He favored the soldiers and the poor against the busi- ness
classes and the aristocracy; possibly the stories we read about him in
Dio Cassius are a senator’s reveng e. Anxious to raise more revenue, he
doubled the inheritance tax to ten per cent; and noting that the tax
applied only to Roman citizens, he extended the Roman franchise to all

son of Varius Marcellus, Maesa spread the rumor that he was the natural
son of Caracalla, and gave him the name Bassianus; the Empire was worth
her daughter’s reputation, and Marcellus was dead. The Roman soldiers in
Syria were already half won to Syrian cults, and felt a pious respect
for the fourteen-year-old priest; moreover, Maesa suggested that if they
would make Elagabalus emperor she would distribute a substantial
donative among them. The soldiers were convinced,</p></li>
<li><p>The “colonate” probably had a major beginning when Aurelius
settled captive Germans on imperial estates (172), and gave them
hereditary possession on condition of an annual tax, military service at
call, and an agreement not to leave their allotment without permission
of the state. Similar conditions were laid upon Roman veterans receiving
frontier lands, espe- cially in the agri decumates —’ “tithe - paying
fields”— along the Danube and Rhine. 21 A great extension of this
imperial colonate occurred under Septimius Severus, who divided the
lands he had appropriated into parcels tilled by tenants paying taxes in
money or kind. As Septimius imitated the Ptolemies, so private
landowners imitated him; the colonate began with mon- archs, and
produced a feudalism that undermined monarchy.</p></li>

<li><p>Early the next morning, according to Eusebius and Lactantius, 31
Constantine dreamed that a voice commanded him to have his soldiers mark
upon their shields the letter X with a line drawn through it and curled
around the top — the symbol of Christ. On arising he obeyed, and then
advanced into the forefront of battle behind a standard (known
henceforth as the labarum ) carrying the initials of Christ interwoven
with a cross. As Max- entius displayed the Mithraic-Aurelian banner of
the Unconquerable Sun, Constantine cast in his lot with the Christians,
who were numerous in his army, and made the engagement a turning point
in the history of religion. To the worshipers of Mithras in
Constantine’s forces the cross could give no offense, for they had long
fought under a standard bearing a Mithraic cross of light. 32 In any
case Constantine won the battle of the Mulvian Bridge, and Alaxentius
perished in the Tiber with thousands of his troops. The victor entered
Rome the welcomed and undisputed master of the West.</p></li>

on the issue, and made the cities ring with such “tumult and dis order .

profane merriment to the pagans, even in their theaters.” 45 Con -
stantine, coming to Nicomedia after overthrowing Licinius, heard the
story from its bishop. He sent both Alexander and Arius a personal
appeal to imi- tate the calm of philosophers, to reconcile their
differences peaceably, or at least to keep their debates from the public
ear. The letter, preserved by Eusebius, clearly reveals Constantine’s
lack of theology , and the political purpose of his religious
policy.</p></li>

probably shocked to find that Roman law permitted the torturing of
freemen to extort confessions or testimony. 3 They were individualistic
to the point of chaos, while the Romans had now been tamed to
sociability and peace. In their higher ranks they showed some
appreciation of literature and art; Stilicho, Ricimer, and other Germans
entered fully into the cul- tural life of Rome, and wrote a Latin that
Symmachus professed to enjoy. 4 In general the invaders — above all, the
Goths — were civilized enough to admire Roman civilization as higher
than their own, and to aim rather at ac- quiring it than at destroying
it; for two centuries they asked little more than admission to the

ecclesiastical politicians of no lovable type, like the Theoph- ilus who
burned to the ground the pagan temple and library of Serapis (389). More
pleasing is the modest bishop of Ptolemais, Synesius. Born in Cyrene
(c. 365), he studied mathematics and philosophy at Alexandria under Hy-
patia; to the end of his life he remained her devoted friend, ca lling
her “the true exponent of the true philosophy.” He visited Athens and
was there confirmed in his paganism; but in 403 he married a Christian
lady, and gal- lantly accepted Christianity; he found it a simple
courtesy to transform his Neoplatonic trinity of the One, the nous , and
the Soul into the Father, Spirit, and the Son. 45 He wrote many
delightful letters, and some minor philo- sophical works of which none
is of value to anyone today except his essay In Praise of Baldness. In
410 Theophilus offered him the bishopric of Ptole- mais. He was now a
country gentleman, with more money than ambition; he protested that he
was unfit, that he did not (as the Nicene Creed required) Believe in the
resurrection of the body, that he was married, and had no in- tention of
abandoning his wife. Theophilus, to whom dogmas were instru- ments,

organized Christianity in his country, revised its ritual, introduced
self-supporting cenobitic monasticism, and drew up a monastic rule that
still governs the monasteries of the Greco- Slavonic world. He advised
his followers to avoid the theatrical severities of the Egyptian
anchorites, but rather to serve God, health, and sanity by useful work;
tilling the fields, he thought, was an excellent prayer. To this day the

<li><p>and with much earnestness forewarned me,</p></li>
<li><p>opponent, the footloose monk Pelagius, with a strong defense of
ma n’s freedom, and of the saving power of good works. God indeed helps
us, said Pelagius, by giving us His law and commandments, by the example
and precepts of His saints, by the cleansing waters of baptism, and the
redeeming blood of Christ. But God does not tip the scales against our
salvation by mak- ing human nature inherently evil. There was no
original sin, no fall of man; only he who commits a sin is punished for
it; it transmits no guilt to his progeny. 60 God does not predestine man
to heaven or hell, does not choose arbitrarily whom He will damn or
save; He leaves the choice of our fate to ourselves. The theory of
innate human depravity, said Pelagius, was a cow- ardly shifting to God
of the blame for man’s sins. Man feels, and therefore is, responsible;
“if I ought, I can.”</p></li>
<li><p>But Innocent, dying, was succeeded by Zosi - mus, who pronounced
Pelagius guiltless. The African bishops appealed to Honorius; the
Emperor was pleased to correct the Pope; Zosimus yielded (418); and the
Council of Ephesus (431) condemned as a heresy the Pe- lagian view that
man can be good without the helping grace cf God.</p></li>

material- ist; he proclaimed, like Kant, that the soul is the most
directly known of all realities, and clearly stated the idealistic
position — that since matter is known only through mind, we cannot
logically reduce mind to matter. 85 He sug- gested the Schopenhauerian

prostitution remained, driven into stealth and degradation. Perhaps to
counterbalance a sexual instinct that had run wild, the new morality
exaggerated chastity into an obsession, and subordinated marriage and
parentage to a lifelong virginity or celibacy as an ideal; and it took
the Fathers of the Church some time to realize that no so- ciety could
survive on such sterile principles. But this puritanic reaction can be
understood if we recall the licentiousness of the Roman stage, the
schools of prostitution in some Greek and Oriental temples, the
widespread abortion and infanticide, the obscene paintings on Pompeian
walls, the unnatural vice so popular in Greece and Rome, the excesses of
the early emperors, the sensuality of the upper classes as revealed in
Catullus and Martial, Tacitus and Juvenal. The Church finally reached a
healthier view, and indeed came in time to take a lenient attitude to
sins of the flesh. Meanwhile some injury was done to the conception of
parentage and the family. Too many Chris- tians of these early centuries
thought that they could serve God best — or, rather, most easily escape
hell — by abandoning their parents, mates, or chil- dren, and fleeing
from the responsibilities of life in the frightened pursuit of a
selfishly individual salvation. In paganism the family had been the

<li><p>The rediscovery of Arabia by modern Europeans illustrates the
internationalism of science in the nineteenth century. It began in
1761-4, when Carstcn Niebuhr traveled through the peninsula under the
auspices of the Danish government; his published account (1772) was the
first comprehensive description of Arabia. In 1807 Domingo Badia y
Leblich, a Spaniard dis- guised as a Moor, visited Mecca, and gave the
first accurate account of the pilgrimage ritual. In 1814-15 Johann
Ludwig Burckhardt (1784-1817), a Swiss disguised as a Moslem, spent
several months in Mecca and Medina; his learned reports were
corroborated by later travelers. In 1853 Richard Burton, an Englishman
dressed as an Afghan pilgrim, visited Medina and Mecca, and described
his perilous journey in two absorbing volumes. In 1869-70 J. Halevy, a
French Jew, explored the sites, and recorded the rock inscriptions, of
the ancient Minaean, Sabaean, and Himyarite kingdoms. In 1875 Charles
Montagu Doughty, an Englishman, traveled from Damascus in the pilgrimage
caravan, and recorded his vicissitudes in Arabia Deserta (1888), one of
the peaks of English prose. In 1882-8 E. Glaser, an Austrian, in three
arduous expeditions, copied 1032 inscriptions, which are now our chief
source for the history of pre- Islamic Arabia.</p></li>
<li><p>The Abyssinians received Christianity, crafts, and arts from
Egypt and Byzantium; their merchant vessels sailed as far as India and
Ceylon; and seven little kingdoms acknowledged the Negus as their sover-
eign.t Meanwhile in Arabia many Himyarites followed the lead of their
king Dhu- Nuwas and accepted Judaism. With a convert’s zeal, Dhu -Nuwas
perse- cuted the Christians of southwest Arabia; they called to their
coreligionists to rescue them; the Abyssinians came, conquered the
Himyarite kings (a.d. 522), and replaced them with an Abyssinian
dynasty. Justinian allied himself with this new state; Persia countered
by taking up the cause of the deposed Himyarites, driving out the
Abyssinians, and setting up in Yemen (5 75) a Persian rule that ended
some sixty years later with the Moslem conquest of Persia.</p></li>
<li><p>The term Semitic is due to the legendary derivation of the
peoples so called from Shem, son of Noah (Gen. x, 1). No clear
definition of Semite can be given. In general the populations of Syria,
Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, and the Arab populations of Africa,
may be called Semitic in the sense that they use Semitic languages; the
ancient peoples of Asia Minor, Armenia, and the Caucasus, and the
peoples of Persia, North India, most of Europe, and all of the
Europeanized Americas may be called “Indo - European” as using Indo

his career might have ended there and then. He personally led his men to
victory, ascribed it to Allah as a miracle con- firming his leadership,

624). Some of these, who had been especially active in the persecution
at Mecca, were put to death; the rest were freed for lucrative ransoms.
31 But Abu Sufyan survived, and promised revenge. “Weep not for your
slain,” he told mourning relatives in Mecca, “and let no bard bewail
their fate. . . . Haply the turn may come, and ye may obtain vengeance.

rulers of Hira and Ghassan, inviting them to accept the new faith;

<li><p>Ibn Hawqal ( c . 975) describes a kind of promissory note for
42,000 dinars addressed to a merchant in Morocco; from the Arabic word
sakk for this form of credit is derived our word check. Investors shared
in financing com- mercial voyages or caravans; and though interest was
forbidden, ways were found, as in Europe, of evading the prohibition and
repaying capital for its use and risk. Monopolies were illegal, but
prospered. Within a century after Omar’s death the Arab upper classes
had amassed great wealth, and lived on luxurious estates manned by
hundreds of slaves. 11 Yahya the Barma- kid offered 7,000,000 dirhems
(60,000) for a pearl box made of precious stones, and was refused; the
Caliph Muqtafi, if we may believe Moslem fig- ures, left at his death
20,000,000 dinars (4,500,000) in jewelry and per- fumes. 12 When Harun
al-Rashid married his son al-Mamun to Buran, her grandmother emptied a
shower of pearls upon the groom; and her father scattered among the

dirhem (from the Greek drachma ) contained forty-three grams of silver,
worth some eight cents. As the purity of the coinage varied, our

most fully achieves his own desires. How did human society emerge from
this jungle law? If we may trust al- Farabi’s account, there were both
Rousseauians and Nietzscheans among the Moslems who took up this
question: some thought that society had begun in an agreement, among
individuals, that their survival required the accept- ance of certain
restraints through custom or law; others laughed this “social contract”
out of history, and insisted t hat society, or the state, had begun as

discriminating philanthropy.</p></li>
<li><p>The revelation was too long delayed; already many master- pieces
of Persian architecture had crumbled to earth. Muqaddasi ranked the
mosque of Fasa with that of Medina, and the mosque of Turshiz with the
Great Mosque of Damascus; the mosque of Nishapur, with its marble col-
umns, gold tiles, and richly carved walls, was one of the wonders of the
time; and “no mosque in Khurasan or Sistan equaled in beauty” the mosque
of Herat. 132 We may vaguely judge the exuberance and quality of Persian
architecture in the ninth and tenth centuries from the stucco reliefs
and carved columns and capitals of the mihrab in the Congregational
Mosque at Nayin, now mostly destroyed, and the two lovely minarets that
survive at Damghan. The Friday Mosque at Ardistan (1055) still shows a
handsome mihrab and portal, and many elements that were to appear later
in Gothic: pointed arches, groined pendentives, cross vaults, and ribbed
dome. 133 In these and most Persian mosques and palaces the building
material was brick, as in Sumerian and Mesopotamian antiquity; stone was
rare and costly, clay and heat were plentiful; yet the Persian artist
transformed brick layers with light and shade, novel patterns, and
divers attitudes into such variety of decoration as that modest
substance had never known before. Over the brick, in special places like
portals, minbars, and mihrabs, the Persian potter laid varicolored
mosaics and the most brilliant tiles; and in the eleventh cen- tury he
made bright surfaces more resplendent still with luster-painted faience.
So every art in Islam humbly and proudly served the mosque.</p></li>

tear of time; we can only surmise their excellence from later work, and

most part left the actual work of agriculture to the conquered; however,
they used the latest manuals of agronomy, and under their direction
agricultural science developed in Spain far in advance of Christian
Europe. 45 The leisurely oxen, hitherto uni- versally used in Spain for
plowing or draft, were largely replaced by the mule, the ass, and the
horse. Stock breeding of Spanish with Arab strains pro- duced the “noble
steed” of the Arab horseman and the Spanish Caballero. Moslem Spain

in Norway, Iceland, and Greenland by unknown authors at unknown dates
between the eighth and twelfth centuries, that Saemund may have
collected, but did not write, them, and that Edda was not their name.
But time sanctions error as well as theft, and compromises by calling
the poems the Poetic or Elder Edda. Most of them are narrative bal- lads

villains destined to take more definite form in the V olsungasaga and
the Nibelungen- lied. The most powerful of the Edda poems is the
Voluspa, wherein the prophetess Volva describes with somber and majestic
imagery the creation of the world, its coming destruction, and its

raised its head, assumed authority, and chose Crescentius as consul.
Otto III descended upon Rome with an irresistible army, and a commission
from the German prelates to end the chaos by making his chaplain Pope
Gregory V (996-9) . The young Emperor put down the Republic, pardoned
Crescen- tius, and went back to Germany. Crescentius at once
re-established the Republic, and deposed Gregory (997). Gregory
excommunicated him, but Crescentius laughed, and arranged the election
of John XVI as pope. Otto returned, deposed John, gouged out his eyes,
cut off his tongue and nose, and paraded him through the streets of Rome
on an ass, with his face to the tail. Crescentius and twelve Republican
leaders were beheaded, and their bodies were hung from the battlements

restoration. 1 In 1047 the Moslem traveler Nasir-i-Khosru de- scribed it

Byzantine brocade, worked in gold. . . . And they have portrayed Jesus —

to the holy places; a pilgrimage to Palestine had long been a form of
devotion or pen- ance; everywhere in Europe one met “palmers” who, as a
sign of pilgrimage accomplished, wore crossed palm leaves from
Palestine; such men, said Piers Plowman, “had leave to lie all their
lives thereafter.” 3 But in 1070 the Turks took Jerusalem from the
Fatimids, and pilgrims began to bring home ac- counts of oppression and
desecration. An old story, not verifiable, relates that one wayfarer,
Peter the Hermit, brought to Pope Urban II, from Simeon, Patriarch of

lords, armed with mercenaries and fortified in castles, had pulverized
the state into baronies. With awesome energy the youthful king gathered
money and men, fought and subdued one lord after another, destroyed the
feudal castles, and established order, security, justice, and peace.
With a masterly economy of cost and force he brought under English rule

the parish was normally coterminous with a manor or a village, he was
usually appointed by the lord of the manor 111 in collusion with the
bishop. He was seldom a man of much schooling, for a university
education was costly and books were rare; it was enough if he could read
the breviary and the missal, administer the sacraments, and organize the
parish for worship and charity. In many cases he was only a vicarius, a
vicar or substitute, hired by a rector to do the reli- gious work of the
parish for a fourth of the revenues of the “benefice”; in this way one
rector might hold four or five benefices while the parish priest lived
in humble poverty , 112 eking out his income with “altar fees” for
baptisms, marriages, burials, and Masses for the dead. Sometimes, in the
class war, he sided with the poor, like John Ball . 113 His morals could
not compare with those of the modern priest, who has been put on his
best behavior by religious competition; but by and large he did his work
with patience, conscience, and kindliness. He visited the sick,
comforted the bereaved, taught the young, mumbled his breviary, and
brought some moral and civilizing leaven to a rough and lusty
population. Many parish priests, said their crudest critic, “were the

execute the sculpture of the cathedral fagade. In 1 290 he chiseled some
reliefs for the bizarre face of the Orvieto Cathedral. Thence he
returned north to Pistoia, and carved for the church of Sant’ Andrea a
pulpit less virile than his father’s at Pisa, but excelling it in
natural - ness and grace; this, indeed, is the loveliest product of
Gothic sculpture in Italy.</p></li>

Norman church, and reveal the skill and power of the older style. At
Winchester the transepts and crypt remain of the Norman cathedral of 108

<li><p>— a French still so Latin that it was called lingua romana; not
till the tenth century was it sufficiently distinct to receive the name
lingua gallica. The lingua romana in turn divided into what France
called two languages: the longue (Toe of France south of the Loire, and
the langue d’o’il of northern France. It was a medieval custom to
differentiate dialects by their way of saying yes : South France said it
with oc from the Latin hoc, this; the North used oil, a fusion of the
Latin hoc ille, this-that. Southeastern France had a dialect of t he
langue d’oc called Provencal; it be - came a polished literary language
in the hands of the troubadours, and was almost snuffed out by the
Albigensian Crusades.</p></li>
<li><p>The first three lines will indicate ho w slowly French and German
evolved: “Pro Deo amur et pro Christian poblo et nostro commun
salvament, dist di in avant, in quant Deus savir et podir me
dunat.”</p></li>
<li><p>the skins were cut in rectangular sizes to make four (“quarto”),
eight (“octavo”), twelve (“duodecimo”), or sixteen (“sextodecimo”)
sheets to a folio. Some sexto - decimos, written in a “fine Italian
hand,” crowded long w orks into small compass to fit into the pocket or
be a convenient manual. The binding might be of heavy parchment, cloth,
leather, or board. Leather covers might be decorated by “blind tooling”—
i.e., stamping uncolored designs into them with hot metal dies. Moslem
artists settled in Venice introduced into Europe the technique of
filling in such depressed parts with gold tints. Wood covers might be
decorated with enamel or carved ivory, or inlaid with gold, silver, or
gems. St. Jerome rebuked the Rom ans: “Your books are carved with
precious stones, and Christ died naked!” 14 Few modern volumes rival the
sumptuous bindings of medieval books.</p></li>
<li><p>Many government records continued to be written on rolls; such
“pipe rolls” were used in England from 1131 to 1833. The keeper of these
archives was “Master of the Rolls.”</p></li>
<li><p>Further “colleges”— collegia in the old sense of associations —
were founded after 1300; masters came to live in them, served as tutors,
heard recitations, and “read” texts with the students. In the fifteenth
century the masters gave courses in the residence halls; such courses
increased in number, courses given outside decreased, and the college
became a hall of education as well as a student dwelling place. A
similar evolution of the college out of the hospictum occurred at
Oxford, Montpellier, and Toulouse. The university began as an
association of teach- ers dealing with associations of students, and
became an association of facul- ties and colleges.</p></li>
<li><p>In the sixteenth century the Sorbonne became the theological
faculty of the University; in 1792 it was closed by the Revolution; it
was restored by Napoleon, and is now the seat of public courses in
science and letters at the University of Paris.</p></li>
<li><p>in general the universities of Paris, Oxford, and Bologna had
more students in</p></li>
<li><p>These are the conservative estimates of Rashdall. 63 The jurist
Odofredus, writing about 1250, reckoned the students in Bologna in 1200
at 10,000. Rabanus Gauma, a Nestorian monk, put the number of students
at Paris in 1287 at 30,000. Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, calcu -
lated, about 1360, that there had once been 30,000 students at Oxford;
about 1380 Wyclif doubled this estimate; in 1450 Bishop Gascoigne, who
had been Chancellor of Oxford, re- turned to 3o,ooo. 64 These estimates
are evidently guesswork and exaggeration; but we cannot prove them
false.</p></li>
<li><p>Jacques goes on to tell how each national group among the
students had favorite adjectives for the other groups: the English were
heavy drinkers and had tails; the French were proud and effeminate; the
Germans were furibundi (blusterers) and “ob - scene in their cups”; the
Flemish were fat and greedy and “soft as butter”;</p></li>
<li><p>But cf. Rashdall: “There is only too much evidence that de
Vitry’s picture of the scholas - t ic life of his age, if exaggerated,
is not fundamentally untruthful.” 68</p></li>

<li><p>It should be noted that this view was held by only a sector of
the Scholastic front. 47</p></li>
<li><p>Few men in history have written so much, or borrowed so much, or
so frankly acknowledged their debts. Albert bases his works almost
title</p></li>
<li><p>In logic and metaphys- ics he takes Aristotle as his guide, and
quotes him on almost every page; but he does not hesitate to differ from
him wherever the Philosopher strays from Christian doctrine. Having
admitted that the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Redemption, and the Last
Judgment cannot be proved by reason, he proceeds on all other points to
accept reason with a fullness and readiness that shocked the followers
of Augustine. He Was a mystic in so far as he acknowledged the
suprarationality of certain Christian dogmas, and shared the mystic
long- ing for union with God; but he was an “intellectualist” in the
sense that he preferred the intellect to the “heart” as an organ for
arriving at truth. He saw that Europe was bound for an Age of Reason,
and he thought that a Christian philosopher should meet the new mood on
its own ground. He prefaced his reasonings with Scriptural and Patristic
authorities, but he said, with pithy candor: Locus ab auctoritate est
inftrmissimus — “the argument from authority is the wea kest .” 60 “The
study of philosophy,” he wrote, “does not aim merely to find out what
others have thought, but what the truth of the matter is .” 67 His
writings rival those of Aristotle in the sus - tained effort of their
logic.</p></li>

<li><p>“We shall try,” says the Prologue, “to follow the things that per
- tain to sacred doctrine with such brevity and lucidity as the subject
matter allows.” We may smile at this twenty -one-volume brevity, but it
is there; this Summa is immense, but not verbose; its size is merely the
result of its scope. For within this treatise on theology are full
treatises on metaphys- ics, psychology, ethics, and law; thirty-eight
treatises, 631 questions or topics, 10,000 objections or replies. The
orderliness of argument within each question is admirable, but the
structure of the Summa has received more praise than its due. It cannot
compare with the Euclidean organization of Spinoza’s Ethics, - or the
concatenation of Spencer’s Synthetic Philosophy. The treatise on
psychology (Part I, QQ. 75-94) is introduced between a discussion of the
six days of creation and a study of man in the state of orig- inal
innocence. The form is more interesting than the structure. Essentially
it continues, and perfects, the method of Abelard as developed by
Peter</p></li>

Maimonides; (4) from Anselm.</p></li>
<li><p>If at this point one asks why a God who foresees all should have
created a man and a woman destined to such curiosity, and a race
destined to such heritable guilt, Thomas answers that it is
metaphysically impossible for any creature to be perfect, and that man’s
free - dom to sin is the price he must pay for his freedom of choice.
Without that free- dom of will man would be an automaton not beyond but
below good and evil, having no greater dignity than a machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Thomas, not foreseeing that the Church would decide in favor of
the Immaculate Con- ception of the Virgin — i.e., her freedom from the
taint of original sin — thought that Mary too had been “conceived in
sin”; he added, with tardy gallantry, that she was “sanctified before
her birth from the womb.” 110</p></li>
<li><p>A first impression is that Thomas merely repeats Aris -</p></li>
<li><p>Of this only Book I, and Chapters 1-4 of Book II, are by Thomas;
the remainder is by Ptolemy of Lucca.</p></li>

<li><p>The oft-quoted passage about the blessed in heaven enhancing
their bliss by observing the sufferings of the damned occurs in the
Summa’s Supplement (xcvii, 7 ), and is to be discredited not to Thomas

“numberless references to Roman antiquity.” Instead of studying law he
read all that he could find of Virgil, Cicero, and Seneca. They opened
to him a new world, both of philosophy and of literary art. He began to
think like them, he longed to write like them. When his parents died
(1326) he abandoned law, returned to Avignon, and steeped himself in
classic poetry and romantic love.</p></li>

these prelates were at - tacked and destroyed; the crowd set fire to the
building that housed the conclave; the cardinals broke a passage through
the rear wall, and fled from the fire and the mob. For two years no
further attempt was made to choose a pope. Finally at Lyons, under the
protection of French sol- diery, the cardinals raised to the papacy a
man already seventy-two years of age, who might reasonably be expected
to die soon, but who was des- tined to rule the Church for eighteen
years with rugged zeal, insatiable avidity, and imperial will. John XXII

<li><p>The classic world, the Italians felt, had died in the German and
Hun invasions of the third, fourth, and fifth centuries; the heavy hand
of the Goth had crushed the fading but still fair flower of Roman art
and life; “Gothic” art had repeated the in - vasion with an architecture
precariously unstable and decoratively bizarre, and a sculpture coarse,
crude, and gloomy with dour prophets and emaci- ated saints. Now, by the
grace of time, those bearded Goths and those “long - beard” Lombards had
been absorbed into the dominant Italian blood; by the grace of Vitruvius

<li><p>Averardo de’ Medici, great-great-grandfather of Cosimo, founded
the fortune of the family by bold commerce and judicious finance, and
was chosen gonfalonier in 1314. Averardo’s grandnephew, Salvestro de’
Medici, gonfalonier in 137 8, estab- lished the popularity of the family
by espousing the cause of the rebel poor. Salvestro’s grandnephew,
Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici, gonfalonier in 1421, further endeared the
family to the people by supporting — though he himself would suffer
heavily from it — an annual tax ( catasto ) of one half of one per cent
on income, which was reckoned at seven per cent of a man’s capital
(1427). 12 The rich, who had previously enjoyed a poll or head tax
merely equal to that paid by the poor, vowed vengeance on the

the Medici palace, and now in the Bargello. Here the nude figure in the

Bartolommeo Buon the Younger and Antonio Rizzo built an ornate arch,
named after Francesco Foscari, and mingling three architectural styles
in unexpected harmony: Renaissance columns and lintels, Romanesque
arches, Gothic pinnacles. In the niches of the arch Rizzo placed two
strange statues: Adam protesting his innocence, and Eve wondering at the

Correggio is one of several towns in Italy that are remembered only
through some genius to whom they gave a cognomen. Its ruling family also
was called Correggio; one member was the Niccolo da Correggio who wrote
genteel verses for Beatrice and Isa- bella d’Este. It was a place where
you might expect genius to be born and to die, but not to stay, for it
had no significant art, or clear tradition, to give to ability
instruction and form. But in the first decades of the sixteenth century
the house of Correggio was headed by Count Gilbert X, and his wife,
Veronica Gambara, was one of the great ladies of the Renaissance. She
could speak Latin, knew Scholastic philosophy, wrote a commentary on
patristic theo logy, composed delicate Petrarchian verses, was called
“the tenth Muse.” She made her little court a salon for artists and
poets, and helped to spread that romantic worship of woman which was now
re- placing, among the upper classes of Italy, the medieval worship of
Mary, and was molding Italian art toward the representation of feminine
charms. On September 3, 1528, she wrote to Isabella d’Este that “our
Messer An - tonio Allegri has just finished a masterpiece picturing
Magdalen in the desert, and ex pressing in full the sublime art of which
he is a great master.” 1</p></li>

aqueducts by the barbarian invasions, the seven hills had been without a
reliable water supply; some minor aqueducts remained, some springs, many
cisterns and wells; but a large proportion of the inhabitants drank the
water of the Tiber. 2 Most of the people lived in the unhealthy plains,
subject to inundation from the river and to malarial infection from the
neighboring swamps. The Capitoline hill was now called Monte Caprino,
from the goats ( capri ) that nibbled its slopes. The Palatine hill was
a rural retreat, almost uninhabited; the ancient palaces from which it
derived its name were dusty quarries. The Borgo Vaticano, or Vatican
Town, was a small suburb across the river from the central city, and
huddled about the decaying shrine of St. Peter. Some churches, like
Santa Maria Maggiore or Santa Cecilia, were beautiful within but plain
without; and no church in Rome could compare with the duomo of Florence
or Milan, no monastery could rival the Certosa di Pavia, no town hall
rose to the dignity of the Palazzo Vecchio, or the Castello Sforzesco,
or the Palace of the Doges, or even the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena.

Italy in saving it, and taugbt the “barbarians” that they might fight

himself tbe master of Europe, the dictator to kings. Guicciardini
condemned him for “bringing empire to the Apostolic See by arms and the
shedding of Christian blood, rather than troubling himself to set an

became one of his cardinals. From the collections of art, and the
conversations about art, in or around his father’s palace h e imbibed
that taste for the beautiful which was almost a religion to him in his

sometimes reckless generosity, and the gay, almost epicurean, manner of
life, which were to distinguish his cardinalate and his pontificate,
with far-reaching results to the Christian world. At thirteen he entered

for his temperament, he settled down at Seton Hall College, South
Orange, New Jersey, to teach Latin, French, English, and geometry
(1907-n). He entered the sem- inary at Seton Hall in 1909, but withdrew
in 1911 for reasons which he has described in his book Transition . He
passed from this quiet seminary to the most radical circles in New York,
and became (1911-13) the teacher of the Ferrer Modern School, an
experiment in libertarian education. In 1912 he toured Europe at the
invitation and expense of Alden Freeman, who had befriended him and now

<li>In the Centum Gravamina, or Hundred Grievances, listed against the
Church by the Diet of Nuremberg ( 1 5 2 2 ) , it was alleged that she
owned half the wealth of Germany. 28 A Catholic historian reckoned the
Chur ch’s share as a third in Germany and a fifth in France ; 2i but a
procurer-general of the Parlement calculated in 1 502 that three
quarters of all French wealth was ecclesias- tical. 25 No statistics are
available to check these estimates. In Italy, of course, one third of
the peninsula belonged to the Church as the Papal States, and she owned
rich properties in the rest.t</li>

<li><p>were men of meager schooling, some were Oxford dons. All went
robed in black wool and barefoot, like the early friars; all were warmed
with the ardor of men who had rediscovered Christ. Theirs was already
the Protestant emphasis on an infallible Bible as against the fallible
traditions and dogmas of the Church, and on the sermon in the vernacular
as against a mystic ritual in a foreign tongue. 48 For these lay
priests, and for their literate hearers, Wyclif wrote in rough and
vigorous English some 300 sermons and many religious tracts. And since
he urged a return to the Christianity of the New Testament, he set
himself and his aides to translate the Bible as the sole and unerring
guide to true religion. Till that time (1381) only small portions of
Scripture had been rendered into English; a French translation was known
to the educated classes, and an Anglo- Saxon version, unintelligible to
Wyclif ’s Eng land, had come down from King Alfred’s time. The Church,
finding that heretics like the Waldensians made much use of the Bible,
had discouraged the people from reading unauthorized translations, 44
and had deprecated the creedal chaos that she expected when every party
should make and color its own translation, and every reader be free to
make his own interpretation, of the Scriptural text. But Wyclif was
resolved that the Bible should be available to any Englishman who could
read. He appears to have translated the New Testament himself, leaving
the Old Testament to Nicholas Hereford and John Purvey. The whole was
finished some ten years after Wyclif’s death.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevertheless one might rise from class to class; a rich
merchant’s daughter could catch a noble and a title, and Chaucer,
reborn, would have been startled to find his granddaughter a duchess.
The middle classes assumed such manners of the aristocracy as they could
manage; they began to address one another as Master in England, Mon
seigneur in France; soon every man was a Mister or Monsieur, and every
woman a Mistress or Madame A</p></li>
<li><p>Livery was originally, in Anglo-French, livree, a delivery or
allowance of provisions or clothing, made by a lord to a vassal. In time
the clothing took on the character of a uniform worn by the clients of a
great man in the pomp of his retinue. Guilds adopted the custom and
proudly wore their distinctive livery at their meetings and in their
parades. Such habits gave color to “Merrie England.”</p></li>

<li><p>in which an employer supplied capital, materials, and machinery
to shop- workers paid by the piece and no longer protected by the guild.
Admission to a guild became ever costlier; thousands of workers became
journeymen — day laborers — who went from town to town, from shop to
shop, getting only temporary employment, with wages that forced them to
live in slums and left them little property beyond the clothes they
wore. 1 Communistic ideas appeared among proletaires and peasants; the
poor asked why they should go hungry while the barns of barons and
bishops creaked with grain; and all men who did not work with their
hands were denounced as parasites. The employers in their turn
complained of the risks their investments ran, the uncertainty and
periodicity of supplies, the foundering of their cargoes, the
fluctuations of the market, the tricks of competitors, and the repeated
strikes that raised wages and prices, unsettled the currency, and
narrowed some employers’ profits to the edge of solvency. 2 Louis de
Nevers, Count of Flanders, sided too strongly with the employers. The
populace of Bruges and Ypres, supported by the neighboring peasantry,
rose in revolt, deposed Louis, plundered abbeys, and slew a few
millionaires. The Church laid an interdict upon the revolted regions;
the rebels nevertheless forced the priests to say Mass; and one leader,
stealing a march of 450 years on Diderot, vowed he would never be
content till the last priest had been hanged.® Louis ap- pealed to his
liege lord, the French king; Philip VI came, defeated the revolu-
tionary forces at Cassel (1328), hanged the burgomaster of Bruges,
restored the count, and made Flanders a dependency of France.</p></li>
<li><p>We may define capital as goods or funds used to produce goods for

capitalism as an economic system or process dominated by

<li><p>Very probably the decisions aimed also to exclude from the
succession the sister of Philip IV, Isabelle, who had married Edward II
of England and had borne Edward III (1312). The French were resolved
that no English king should rule France.</p></li>

<li><p>Charles of Valois, to raise new taxes, undertook to establish a
parliamentary government in France. Paris and other cities had long had
parlements, but these were small appoin- tive bodies, usually of
jurists, normally limited to giving legal advice to the local ruler or
the king, and registering his decrees as part of French law. This
States-General, controlled by a transient coalition of clergy and
bourgeoisie, demanded of the royal council why the vast sums raised for
war had pro- duced only undisciplined troops and shameful defeats; it
ordered the arrest of twenty-two governmental agents, and commanded the
administrators of the treasury to return the sums they were accused of
embezzling; it imposed restrictions on the royal prerogative; it thought
even of deposing John the Good, barring his sons from the succession,
and giving the throne of France to King Charles the Bad of Navarre, a
lineal descendant of Hugh Capet. Appeased by the prudent humility of the
Dauphin, it recognized him as re- gent, and voted him funds for 30,000
men-at-arms; but it bade him dismiss corrupt or ignorant officials,
warned him against tampering with the coinage, and appointed a committee
of thirty-six men to keep an eye on the operations and expenditures of
the government. Judges were condemned for their extravagant equipage,
their dilatory idleness, their calendars twenty years behind; hereafter
they were to begin their sessions at sunrise, at the same hour when
honest citizens went to their shops or their fields. This “Great
Ordinance” of 1357 also forbade nobles to leave France or to wage
private</p></li>
<li><p>This was apparently at first a proper name, Delphinus (Dolphin) ,
which, often repeated in the ruling families of Vienne and Auvergne,
became ( c . 1250) a title of dignity. In 1285 it was officially
conferred upon the eldest son of the Count of Vienne, and Delphinatus 01
Dauphine was thenceforth used to designate the county, of which Grenoble
is now the principal seat. In 1349 Count Humboldt II of the Viennois
sold the Dauphine, with the title Dauphin, to Charles of Valois, son of
King John II. When Charles became ldng in 1364 he transferred the tide
to his eldest son; and thereafter the eldest son of a French king was
regularly known as the Dauphin of the Viennois.</p></li>

the rebel army at Sevenoaks (June 18, 1450) . To the sur- prise of all,
the rebels won, and poured into London. To appease them the King’s
Council ordered the arr est of Lord Saye and William Crowmer, offi-
cials especially hated for their exactions and tyranny. On July 4 they
were surrendered to the mob that besieged the Tower; they were tried by
the rebels, refused to plead, and were beheaded. According to Holinshed
the two heads were raised on pikes and carried through the streets in
joyous pro- cession; every now and then their mouths were knocked
together in a bloody kiss. 17 The Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Bishop of Winchester nego- tiated a peace, granting some demands and
offering amnesty. The rebels agreed and dispersed. Jack Cade, however,
attacked the castle of Queens- borough in Sheppey; the government
outlawed him, and on July 12 he was mortally wounded while resisting
arrest. Eight accomplices were condemned to death; the rest were
pardoned by the King, “to the great rejoicing of all his subjects.”

<li><p>and the unknown genius (perhaps Hubert van Eyck) set a model and
pace for a thou- sand Lowland landscape artists by depicting with
microscopic zeal a port with ships beached or in full sail, passengers
disembarking, sailors and long- shoremen at their diverse tasks, waves
breaking on a crescent shore, white clouds moving stealthily across the
sky — all in the space of a picture card. In 1392 Melchior Broederlam of
Ypres brightened the Chartreuse de Champmol with the oldest significant
panel extant outside of Italy. But Broederlam and the artists who
painted the walls and statuary of the monas- tery used traditional
tempera — mixing their colors with some gelatinous ma- terial. Nuances
of shading and tint, and translucency of tone, were hardly attainable by
these means, and moisture could ruin the finished work. As early as 1329
Jacques Compere of Ghent had experimented with colors mixed in oil.
Through a hundred years of trial and error the Flemings de- veloped the
new technique; and in the first quarter of the fifteenth century it
revolutionized pictorial art. When Hubert van Eyck and his younger
brother Jan painted The Adoration of the Lamb for the cathedral of
St. Bavon at Ghent, they not only established the superiority of oil as
a vehicle of color; they produced one of the supreme masterpieces in the
history of painting, for whose sake St. Bavon has been a goal of
pilgrimage ever since.</p></li>
<li><p>The Adoration of the Lamb has survived many restorations and
vicissitudes. It was retouched in 1550, 1663, 1825, 1829, 1859, 1936,
1951. The major pordons were removed by the French Revolutionary Army to
Paris in 1794, and were returned in 1816. The wings (without Adam and

<li><p>but we can vaguely follow Jan through a prosperous career. Philip
the Good made him varlet de chotmbre (then a position of much dignity
and affluence), and sent him abroad with embassies as a jewel from the
Burgundian crown. Some twenty- four extant paintings are ascribed to
him, and nearly every one is a chef- d’oeuvre. Dresd en has a Virgin and
Child second only to the Adoration in the Van Eyck production; Berlin
boasts The Man with the Fink — a dour face strangely incongruous with
the fondled flower; Melbourne has the bril- liantly colored “Ince Hall
Madonna” hardly nine i nches by six, yet valued at 50,000; Bruges
treasures The Madonna with Canon van der Paele — the Virgin lovely from
her flowing hair to the hem of her marvelously wrinkled gown, the Canon
fat and bald and good-natured, one of the great portraits of the
fifteenth century; London shows the newlyweds Giovanni Arnolfini and his
spouse in an interior sparkling with mirror and chandelier; the Frick
Collection in New York has recently acquired, at unstated but enormous
cost, a richly colored Virgin and Child with Sts. Bar birr a and
Elizabeth; Washington has an Annunciation remarkable for its illusion of
spatial depth, and for the splendor of Gabriel’s raiment, which steals
the scene from Mary; and the Louvre owns The Madonna with Chancellor
Rolin , with a fascinating landscape of winding river, crowded bridge,
tow- ered city, flowered gardens, and a range of hills rising to greet
the sun. In all of these, besides their full-bodied colors, there is a
resolve to picture the donors as they were and looked, to reveal on a
face the life its owner had led, the thoughts and feelings that through
the years had formed the features into a confession of character. In
such portraits the medieval spirit of ideali- zation is set aside, and a
modern naturalism — perhaps reflecting middle-class secularism — is in
full swing.</p></li>

“No one is by nature Christian or pious . . . the world and the masses
are and always will be unchristian. . . . The wicked always outnumber
the good .” 126 Even in the good man evil actions out - number t he
good, for he cannot escape from his nature; as Paul said, “There is none
righteous, no, not one.” “We are the children of wrath,” Luther felt,
“and all our works, intentions, and thoughts are nothing at all in the
balance against our sins .” 127 So f ar as good works go, every one of
us would merit damnation. By “good works” Luther meant especially those
forms of ritual piety recommended by the Church — fasting, pilgrimages,
prayers to the saints, Masses for the dead, indulgences, processions,
gifts to the Church; but he also included all “works, whatever their
character .” 128 He did not ques - tion the need of charity and love for
a healthy social life, but he felt that even a life blessed with such
virtues could not earn an eternity of bliss. “The Gospel preaches
nothing of the merit of works; t he that says the Gospel re- quires
works for salvation, I say flat and plain he is a liar .” 129 No amount
of good works could atone for the sins — each an insult to an infinite
deity — com- mitted by the best of men. Only the redeeming sacrifice of
Christ — the suffer- ing and death of the Son of God — could atone for
man’s sins; and only belief in that divine atonement can save us from
hell. As Paul said to the Romans, “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth
the Lord Jesus, and shalt beueve in thine heart that God hath raised him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 130 It is this faith that
“justifies”— makes a man just despite his sins, and eligible for
salvation. Christ Himself said: “He that believeth and is baptized shall
be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned .” 131 “Wherefore,”

notion that a priest, by the incantation of his words, can change bread

argued, Christ of His own will comes down from heaven to be present con-
substantially with the bread and wine of the sacrament. The Eucharist is
no priestly magic, but a divine and perpetual miracle. 145</p></li>

was the patriotism of each principality; German unity was not furthered,
it was hindered, by the religious revolution; but it is not certain that
unity would have been a blessing. When Ferdinand was chosen emperor
(1558) his Imperial powers were less than those that even the harassed
and hampered Charles had possessed. In effect the Holy Roman Empire died

to provide in one book a substitute for both the missal and the breviary

this First Book of Common Prayer (1548) was essentially Cranmer’s
personal product, in which zeal for the new faith merged with a fine
sense for solemn beauty in feeling and phrase; even his translations
from the Latin had the spell of genius on them. The Book was not quite
revolutionary; it followed some Lutheran leads, as in rejecting the
sacrificial character of the Mass, but it neither denied nor affirmed
transubstantiation; it retained much Catholic ritual, and could be
accepted by not too precise a Romanist. Cranmer sub- mitted it not to
Convocation but to Parliament, and that laic body had no qualms of
jurisdiction in prescribing religious ritual and belief. The Book was

<li><p>Yet Parliament, repeatedly begging her to marry, assumed her
capacity to bear. Something went wrong, in this regard, with most of
Tudor royalty: probably the misfortunes of Catherine of Aragon in
childbirth were due to Henry VIII’s s yphilis; his son Edward died in
youth of some ill-described disease; his daughter Mary tried</p></li>
<li><p>In 1566 she promised Parliament, “I will marry as soon as I can
conveniently . . . and I hope to have children.”®^ But in that same
year, when Cecil told her that Mary Stuart had borne a son, Elizabeth
almost wept, and said, “The Queen of Scots is the mother of a fair son,
and I am but a barren stock.”®® There for a moment she revealed her
lasting grief — that she could not fulfill her womanhood.</p></li>
<li><p>She must have felt some satisfac tion when Philip II, the
greatest potentate in Christendom, offered her his seasoned hand
(1559).</p></li>
<li><p>® Raleigh told her that she walked like Venus, hunted like Diana,
rode like Alexander, sang like an angel, and played like
Orpheus.</p></li>
<li><p>She spat as she list — once upon a costly coat. She was usually
amiable and easy of access, but she talked volubly, and she could be an
unanswerable shrew. She swore like a pirate (which, by proxy, she was) ;
“by God’s death” w as among her milder oaths. She could be cruel, as in
playing cat and mouse with Mary Stuart, or letting Lady Catherine Grey
languish and die in the Tower; but she was basically kind and merciful,
and she mingled tenderness with her blows. She often lost her temper,
but she soon regained control of herself. She roared with laughter when
amused, which was often. She loved to dance, and</p></li>
<li><p>Her mind was as sharp as her speech, and her wit kept pace with
the time. Francis Bacon reported that “she was wont to say of her
instructions to great officers that they were like to garments, strait
at the first putting on, but did by and by wear</p></li>
<li><p>but perhaps he spoke in the bitterness of unrequited devotion.
Her skill lay in feminine delicacy and subtlety of perception, not in
laborious logic, and sometimes the outcome revealed more wisdom in her
feline tentatives than in their reasoning. It was her indefinable spirit
that counted, that baffled Europe and enthralled England, that gave spur
and color to her country’s flower - ing. She re-established the
Reformation, but she represented the Renais- sance — the lust to live
this earthly life to the full, to enjoy and embellish it every day. She
was no exemplar of virtue, but she was a paragon of vitality. Sir John
Hayward, whom she sent to the Tower for giving re- bellious notions to
the younger Essex, forgave her enough to write of her, nine years after
she could reward him;</p></li>
<li><p>^</p></li>
<li><p>® Several dramatists — Greene, Kyd, Marlowe — ^were reputed
atheists. The Elizabethan drama, which otherwise so widely pictures
life, contains remarkably little about the strife of faiths, but makes a
great play of pagan mythology.</p></li>
<li><p>Raleigh was accused of having listened to Marlowe’s reading of an
essay on “atheism.” In March 1594 a government commission sat at Cerne
Abbes, Dorset, to investigate rumors of a set of atheists in the
vicinity — which included Raleigh’s home. The inquiry led to no action
now known to us, but</p></li>
<li><p>®</p></li>
<li><p>”® Parsons urged the Catholic powers to invade England; the
Spanish ambassador in England condemned the plan as “criminal folly,”
and Everard Mercurian, general of the Jesuit order, forbade Parsons to
meddle in politics.®^ Undeterred, he decided on a personal invasion. He
disguised himself as an English officer returning from service in
the</p></li>
<li><p>A Catholic historian adds: “If the Secretary of State approved of
the killing of Eliza - beth, this was in conformity with the principles
of law then in force. Gregory, too, with whom the Secretary of State
undoubtedly consulted before he sent his letter . . . concurred in this
view.”®®</p></li>
<li><p>but English spies got wind of them, England made
counterpreparations, and the in- vasion was postponed.</p></li>
<li><p>^^ The Catholics of En gland answered by fighting as bravely as
the Protestants against the Spanish Armada.</p></li>
<li><p>She saw in the popular e lection of ministers, and in the
government of the Church by presbyteries and synods independent of the
state, a republican threat to monarchy. Only her monarchical power, she
thought, could keep England Protestant; popular suffrage would restore
Catholicism.</p></li>
<li><p>^ Charles consented, but Philip II condemned the trade and in-
structed the Spanish-American governors to prevent the importation of
slaves except under license — costly and rare — by the home administra-
tion.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1567 she lent him her ship the Jesus; with this and four other
vessels he sailed to Africa, captured all the Negroes his holds could
stow, sold them in Spanish</p></li>
<li><p>® England hailed him as the greatest seaman and pirate of the
age. Elizabeth dined on his ship and dubbed him</p></li>
<li><p>the vanguard of the Armada was sighted in the mouth of the
Channel. The defending fleet sailed out of Plymouth, and on the
twenty-first the action began. The Spaniards waited for the English to
come close enough for grappling; instead, the light English vessels —
built to low lines and narrow beam — scurried around the heavy Spanish
galleons, firing broadsides as they went. The Spanish decks were too
high; their guns fired too far above the English vessels, doing only
minor</p></li>
<li><p>Old Style, ten days earlier than by the Gregorian calendar, which
was adopted by Spain in 1582, but not by England till 1751.</p></li>
<li><p>and his wit, she listened with less than her customary skepticism
to his proposal for English colonies in America; she gave him a charter,
and in 1584 he sent out, but did not accompany, the first of several
expeditions that tried — and failed — to establish a settlement in
Virginia; only the name survived, as a lasting memorial to the Queen’s
inaccessibility. Elizabeth Throckmorton, a maid of honor, proved more
approachable; she accepted Raleigh as her lover, and secretly married
him (1593). As no member of the court might marry without the Quee n’s
consent, the ardent couple received an unexpected honeymoon in the
Tower. Raleigh earned release — with banishment from the court — by
writing to Burghley a letter describing the Queen as an amalgam of all
the perfections in history.</p></li>
<li><p>The tale of his coat in the mnd beneath her feet is a
legend.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacon hoped that Essex would mature into a statesman and give his
mentor some opportunity to rise. In 1592 he appealed again to Cecil in
famous lines:</p></li>
<li><p>® Before Bacon could use this he suffered a brief and genteel
imprisonment for debt.</p></li>
<li><p>® Elizabeth did nothing. On the con- trary — or was it to get rid
of him? — a few months later she appointed him Lord Deputy for
Ireland.</p></li>

<li><p>^ Every willfully unemployed man under thirty not having an
income of forty shillings a year could be forced to take employment as
directed by the local authorities. In the countryside all well men under
sixty could be compelled to join in har- vesting. All workmen were to be
hired by yearly contract, at a kind of guaranteed annual wage. The
justices of the peace were empowered to fix maximum and minimum
remuneration for every employment in their territory; for London
laborers the pay was fixed at ninepence a day. Masters unduly dismissing
employees were to be fined forty shillings; men unlawfully quitting
their jobs were to be jailed; and no employee was to leave his town or
parish without permission of his employer and the local magistrate.
Hours of work were defined as twelve per day in summer and through
daylight in winter. Strikes of any kind were for- bidden under penalty
of imprisonment or heavy fines.^</p></li>
<li><p>and dialects from the provinces; and, not content, it made words
breed words and let exuberant imagination riot in originative speech.
Was there ever a language so vivid, powerful, flexible, and rich? It
could not stop to spell consistently; there were, before 1570, no
dictionaries to guide orthography, and Shakespeare never decided how to
spell his name. Shorthand was used, but did not cool the impatience of
bustling business or precipitate poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>In Sha kespeare’s time prat was already popular for “buttocks,”
and duds for “clothes.”</p></li>
<li><p>Aubrey tells a tale that gives point to Ascham: “Sir Walter
Raleigh, being invited to dinner with some great person . . . His son
sat next to his father, and was very demure at least half dinner time.
Then said he: ’I, this morning, not having the fear of God
before</p></li>
<li><p>Then there were epidemics, like the “sweating sick - ness” of
1550 and the plague visitations of 1563, 1592 -94, and 1603. Tenure of
life must have been low; one calculation places it at eight and a half
years.^® Men matured and grew old faster than today. Those who survived
were the hardy, and their adventures with death toughened them for
strata- gems and spoils.</p></li>
<li><p>^</p></li>
<li><p>^ Elizabeth set an example and a vogue of finery, so that in her
reign fashions changed repeatedly as common imitation blurred class
distinction. “The fashion,” mourns a character in Much Ado
about</p></li>

<li><p>Such laws were soon evaded, for the ambitious bourgeoisie
denounced them as not only invidious but restraining trade, and in 1604
they were repealed.</p></li>
<li><p>came into general use throughout Europe in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, being dis- tilled from grain in the north, from
wine in the south. Drunkenness was a protest against the damp climate;
the phr ase “drunk as a lord” suggests that this remedy rose in favor
along the social scale. Tobacco was brought into England by Sir John
Hawkins (1565), by Drake, and by Sir Ralph</p></li>
<li><p>^ Sir Edward Phillips reared Montacute House in chaste
Renaissance style; and Sir Francis Willoughby erected Wollaton Hall.
William Cecil poured part of his gleanings into an immense chateau near
Stamford; and his son Robert spent almost as much on Hatfield House,
whose long gallery is one of the grandest interiors in all the
architecture of the age. Such long galleries, on an upper floor,
replaced in Elizabethan palaces the timbered great hall of the manor
house. Magnificent chimney pieces, massive furniture in walnut or oak,
majestic stairways, carved balustrades, and timbered ceilings gave these
palatial chambers a warmth and dignity missing in the more brilliant
rooms of the French chateaux. So far as we know, the designers of these
palaces were the first to receive the title of architect. The epitaph of
Robert Smythl- son, creator of Wollaton Hall, called him “architector,”
i.e., master builder; now at last the great profession found its modern
name.</p></li>

Pyrocles disguises himself as a woman to be near the fair Philoclea; she
frustrates him by loving him as a sister; her father falls in love, with
him, thinking him a woman; her mother falls in love with him, per-
ceiving him to be a man; however, everything ends according to the Ten
Commandments. Sidney did not take the tale very seriously; he never
corrected the sheets he had dashed off for his sister; on his deathbed
he ordered them burned. They were preserved, edited, and published
(1590), and were for a decade the most admired work in Elizabethan
prose.</p></li>

in the front of the action. But in the battle of Zutphen (September 22)
he was too brave. His horse having been killed in a charge, Sidney
leaped upon another and fought his way into the enemy’s ranks. A musket
ball entered his thigh. His horse, out of control, fled back to L
eicester’s camp.</p></li>
<li><p>It was Sidney who had given Spenser the courage to be a poet.
Edmund had begun unpropitiously as the son of a journeyman clothmaker,
too distantly related to the aristocratic Spensers to allow the boy to
be noticed. Charitable funds sent him to the Merchant Taylors’ School,
then to Pembroke Hall in Cambridge, where he worked for his board.

artifices of the sonneteers, that prepared the Elizabethans to
appreciate Shakespeare.</p></li>
<li><p>In the earlier years of Elizabeth’s reign, Sunday was the usual
day for plays; trumpets announced them just as church bells called the
people to after- noon prayer, and clergymen were dismayed to find their
congregations skipping services to crowd the theater. “Will not a filthy
play, with the blast of a trumpet,” asked a preacher, “sooner call
thither a thousand than an hour’s tolling of a bell bring to a sermon a
hundred?”®® And North - brooke procee ded: “If you will learn … to
deceive your husbands, or</p></li>
<li><p>^ The playwrights, even Shakespeare, continued to salt their
tales with violence, rage, incest, adultery, and prostitution; one scene
in Shakespeare’s Pericles shows a room in a brothel, whose general
manager complains that his personnel “with continual action are even as
good as rotten.”^®</p></li>
<li><p>® In 1599 the price of standing room was o ne penny, of a seat in
the galleries two or three pence; a little more bought a seat on the
stage. This was a spacious platform projecting from one wall into the
center of the yard. At its rear was a “tiring,” or attiring, room, where
the actors donned their costumes and the “stage - keeper” managed the
properties. These included tombs, skulls, box trees, rosebushes,
caskets, curtains, caldrons, ladders, weapons, implements, phials of
blood, and some severed heads. Machines could let gods and goddesses
down from heaven or raise ghosts or witches up through the floor; “rain”
could be produced at the pull of a string, and “double girts” could hang
the sun in the sky.</p></li>
<li><p>^ Women came to the plays in considerable number, not deterred by
pulpit warnings that such mingling was an invitation to seduction.
Sometimes — the class war interrupting the drama — the groundlings threw
the leavings of their collations at the dandies on the stage. To
understand an Elizabethan play we must remember that audience: the
sentiment that welcomed a love story, the hearty humor that wanted
clowns with kings, the swagger that relished rhetoric, the rough
vitality that enjoyed scenes of violence — and the nearness of the
three-sided stage, inviting soliloquies and asides.</p></li>

<li><p>presumably Shakespeare, thinking of rapid production, not of
careful publication, judged that these flaws would pass unnoticed by an
excited audience. Clas- sical norms and modern taste alike condemn the
violence that often dyes Shakespeare’s stage; this was another
concession to the pit, and an effort to meet the competition of the
slaughterhouse school of Elizabethan- Jacobean dramatists.</p></li>
<li><p>So Touchstone asks Corin, and we ask Shakespeare. One of his
confessed rivals gave a negative answer to the question;®^ and we may
accept that judgment as Bernard Shaw meant it — that there is no
metaphysics in Shakespeare, no view as to the ultimate nature of
reality, no theory of God. Shakespeare was too wise to think that a
creature could analyze his creator, or that even his mind, poised on a
moment of flesh, could comprehend the whole. “There are more things in
heaven and ear th, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your
philosophy.”®</p></li>
<li><p>He laughs at logic and prefers imagination’s light; he does not
offer to solve the mysteries of life or mind, but he feels and visions
them with an intensity that shames or deepens our hypotheses. He stands
aside and watches the dogmatists destroy one another or disintegrate in
the catalysis of time. He hides himself in his characters and is hard to
find; we must beware of attributing an opinion to him unless it is
expressed with some emphasis by at least two of his creations.</p></li>
<li><p>Richard II judges that</p></li>

<li><p><sup>®</sup> Death came on April 23, 1616. The body was buried
under the chancel of the Stratford church. Nearby on the floor, graved
on a stone bearing no name, is an epitaph which local tradition ascribes
to Shakespeare’s hand:</p></li>
<li><p>John Evelyn noted in his diary (i66i) that “the old plays disgust
this refined age, since his Majesty’s being so long abroad” — i.e.,
since Charles II and the returning royalists had brought to England the
dramatic norms of France; soon afterward the Restoration theater
produced the bawdiest dramas in modern literature. Shakespeare’s plays
were still performed, but usually in “adaptation” by Dryden, Otway, or
other models of Res- toration taste.</p></li>
<li><p>but when someone ranked the Englishman above Racine, Voltaire
rose to the defense of France by calling Shakespeare “an amiable
barbarian.”<sup>®</sup> His Philosophical Dictionary (1765) made some
amends: “In this same man there are passages which exalt the imagination
and penetrate the heart. . . . He reaches sublimity without having
searched for it.”^®® Mme. de Stael (1804), Guizot (1821), and Villemain
(1827) helped France to bear with Shakespeare. Finally the translation
of the plays into go od French prose by Victor Hugo’s son Francois won
Shakespeare the respect of France, though never the devout admiration
there accorded to Racine.</p></li>

payment of teachers and researchers; for ampler funds to finance
scientific experiments; for better intercommunication, co-operation, and
division of labor among the universities of Europe.^® He does not lose

sacrae he writes, . . ipsa scientia pro- testas est</p></li>

for more science in the curriculum. Science and education so conceived
would be (as in The New Atlantis) not the tool and hand-</p></li>

and anticipates Bergson’s chiding of the intellect as a “constitutional
materialist”: “The human understanding is infected by the, sight of what
takes place in the mechanical arts . . . and so imagines that something
similar goes on in the universal nature of things.”®® He rejects in
advance the mechanistic biology o f Descartes.</p></li>

Christian virtues. Virtue should be practiced in moderation, for the
wicked may take advantage of the indiscreetly good.</p></li>

Friendship is better than love, and married men make unsteady friends.
Bacon talks of love and marriage in the strain of a man who has
sacrificed the tender emotions to ambition, and who could rule a kingdom
better than his home.</p></li>

nation profess arms as their principal honor, study, and occupation.” A
powerful navy is a guarantee of neighborly res pect; “to be master of

the light that he shed. His egotism was the wind in his sails. To see

<li><p>Son of a merchant , he entered the Servite order at thirteen,
absorbed knowledge passionately, and at eighteen defended 318 theses in
a public disputation at Mantua, so successfully that its Duke made him
court theologian. At twenty-two he was ordained priest and became a
professor of philosophy; at twenty-seven he was elected provincial of
his order for the Venetian Republic. He continued his studies in
mathematics, astronomy, physics, everything. He discovered the
contractility of the iris. He wrote scientific treatises that are now
lost, and took part in the investigations and experiments of Fabrizio
d’Acquapendente and Giam - battista della Porta, who said that he had
never met a “more learned man, or one more subtle in the whole circle of
knowledge.”® Perhaps th ese profane studies injured Paolo’s faith. He
welcomed some Protestants to friendship, and charges were lodged against
him before the Venetian Inquisition — the same body that was soon to
capture Giordano Bruno. Thrice he was nominated to bishoprics by the
Senate; thrice the Vatican rejected him; and the memory of these rebuffs
accentuated his hostility to Rome.</p></li>
<li><p>^ The assassins found protection and acclaim in the Papal
States.® Henceforth Sarpi lived quietly in his cloister saying Mass
every day; but his own stilus was not idle. In 1619 he pub- lished,
under a pseudonym and through a London firm, his Istoria del Concilio
Tridentino, a voluminous indictment of the Council of Trent. He gave a
quite Protestant account of the Reformation, and condemned the Council
for making the schism irreconcilable by yielding completely to the
popes. The Protestant world hailed the book with enthusiasm, and Milton
called its author “the great unmasker.” The Jesuits commissioned a
learned scholar of their order, Sforza Pallavicino, to write a counter-
history (1656- 64), which exposed and rivaled Sarpi’s bias and inaccu -
racy.® Despite their parti pris, these two books marked an advance in
the collection and use of original documents, and Sarpi’s vast brief has
the added and dangerous attraction of fiery eloquence. He was far ahead
of his time in advocating a complete separation of Church and
state.</p></li>

rank, with some 45,000 souls in 1558, rising to 100,000 under Sixtus V
(1590). Montaigne, coming to it in 1580, thought it more extensive than
Paris, but having only one third as many houses. Criminals and
prostitutes (before Sixtus V) constituted a sizable part of the
population; many a noble had a standing staff of ruffians. Poverty was
general but genial, alleviated by papal charity, ecclesiastical cere-
monies, religious hopes. The old aristocratic clans — Orsini, Colonna,
Savelli, Gaetani, Chigi — had declined in income and power, though not
in claims and pride; younger families — ^Aldobrandini, Barberini,
Borghese, Farnese, Rospigliosi — ^were taking the lead in fortune and
influence, usually through connections with the popes. Papal nepotism
had another heyday: the Aldobrandini reaped a harvest from the election
of Clement VIII, the Ludovisi from Gregory XV, the Barberini from Urban

the Inquisition to burn Giordano Bruno at the stake (1600). Urban VIII
(1623-44) at first aided Spain and Austria in the Thirty Years’ War; but
when they tried to absorb Mantua he feared encirclement, and turned his
diplomatic maneuvers to co-operation with Richelieu in using the
Protestant armies of Gustavus Adolphus to weaken the Hapsburg power.
Infected with the military spirit of the age, he subordinated spiritual
concerns to the extension of his rule as a secular prince; he acquired
Urbino, and heavily taxed it — and his other states — to finance a papal
army for war against the Duke of Parma. The army proved worthless, and
his death left the papal realm “in such a condition of decay and
exhaustion,” reported a Venetian ambassador, “that it is impossible for
it ever to rise or re -</p></li>

<li><p>The teachers, usually members of the order, were better trained
than their Protestant analogues; they were devoted and unpaid, and their

them to keep discipline without resorting to fear or corporal
punishment. Many Protestants sent their sons to Jesuit
colleges,®</p></li>
<li><p>In 1615 the Jesuits had 372 colleges; in 1700 they had 769, and
twenty-four universities, scattered throughout the world. In Catholic
countries secondary education fell almost entirely into their hands,
giving them an immense influence in shaping the national mind.</p></li>
<li><p>If, said Sarpi, St. Peter had been directed by a Jesuit
confessor, he might have arrived at denying Christ without sin.^® Mutio
Vitelleschi, who succeeded Aquaviva as general of the Jesuits, warned
his order that its anxiety to accumulate wealth was arousing wide
reproach.“</p></li>
<li><p>Slave-hunting bands repeatedly attacked the Jesuit settlements.
The fathers and their subjects evacuated the regions that were most
exposed to these raids. When the raids penetrated farther, the Jesuits
secured permission from the King of Spain to arm their natives with
European weapons; thereafter the raids were successfully resisted. More
dangerous to the colony was the course of European politics and thought.
The persistent political intrigues of Jesuits in France, Spain, and
Portugal combined with the rise of free thought and anticlericalism to
lead to the expulsion of the order from nearly all countries in the
second half of the eighteenth century. The Marquis of Pombal, as ruling
minister in Portugal, was especially active in the movement against the
Jesuits. In 1750 he arranged a treaty by which Portugal ceded to Spain
the colony of San Sacramento, at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, in
exchange for Spanish lands farther north — ^which included seven Jesuit
settlements containing thirty thousand Indians. Meanwhile a false rumor

into a philosophy of procrastination; many problems, he noted, lost
urgency or meaning if resolutely deferred; in several cases, however, as
in the Netherlands, the course of events decided against him while he
weighed or pigeonholed pros and cons. In his royal cubicle he dictated
or wrote with his own hand instructions for his appointees in five
continents. He assumed that kingly power should be absolute; he ignored

<li><p>® Convinced that the Moriscos, while pretending Catholicism, were
still practicing the Islamic ritual, he issued (1567) a pragmatica
forbidding all Moorish customs, the use of the Arabic language, and the
possession of Arabic books. The Moriscos rose in revolt (1568), captured
a large region south of Granada, massacred Christians, tortured priests,
and sold women and children into Berber slavery in exchange for powder
and guns. The rebellion was suppressed after two years of competitive
atrocities. AU Moriscos were expelled from the province of Granada and
were scattered among Christian communities in Castile; their children
were placed in Christian homes, and school attendance was made
compulsory for all children — the first such require- ment in
Europe.</p></li>

England (1599, 1601); both were shattered by unsympathetic winds. Lerma
had the good sense to welcome the pacific overtures of James I, and
after nineteen years of war Spain and England signed the Peace of London
(1604). The war in the Netherlands continued, draining gold from Spain
faster than it could come from America; Lerma found it beyond his
ingenuity to satisfy, out of the revenues of an exhausted country, the
needs of his hampered generals and his private purse. Realizing the
futility of further efforts to deny independence to the United

than the “Old</p></li>

landlords who profited from their Morisco tenants, Lerma is- sued (1609)
an edict that — with some exceptions — all Moors of Valencia province
were to embark within three days on ships provided for them and be
transported to Africa, taking with them only such goods as they could
carry on their backs. The scenes that had marked the expulsion of the
Jews 117 years before were now repeated. Desperate families found
themselves forced to sell their property at great losses; they marched
in misery to the ports; many were robbed, some were murdered, on the way
or on board ship. Reaching Africa, they rejoiced to touch Moslem soil,
but two thirds of them died of starvation there or were killed as
Christians.’</p></li>
<li><p>During the winter of 1609-10 similar expulsions cleared the other
provinces of Moriscos; altogether 400,000 of Spain’s most productive
inhabitants were expropriated and banished. In the eyes of the people
this was the most glorious accomplishment of the reign, and simple
Spaniards looked forward to a more prosperous era now that God had been
appeased by ridding Spain of infidels. The proceeds from the
confiscation of Morisco property rejoiced the court. Lerma pocketed

then marched off on a royal progress lavishly equipped and maintained.
In that same year he died, leav- ing to his son a realm enormous and
impotent, a government corrupt and incompetent, a populace reduced to
destitution, beggary, and theft, a no- bility too proud to pay taxes,

history, and of the great majority of Frenchmen in the seventeenth
century, it was a liberating prog- ress from feudal tyranny to unified
rule. France was not ripe for democ- racy; most of its population were
ill-fed, ill-clothed, illiterate, darkened with superstitions and
murderous with certainties. The towns were con- trolled by businessmen
who could think in no other terms than their own profit or loss; and
these men, hampered at every step by feudal privileges, were not
disposed to unite with the lesser nobles, as in England, to establish a
parliament checking the royal power. The French parlements were not
representative and legislative parliaments; they were superior courts,
nur- tured and mortised in precedent; they were not chosen by the
people, and they became citadels of conservatism. The middle classes,
the artisans, and the peasants approved the absolutism of the king as

prostitutes and thieves,”^® but even this clever correlation failed.
Preachers complained about the calculated risk that ladies took in only
partly covering their curves; if we may believe Montaigne, who was not
often guilty of wishful thinking, “our ladies (dainty -nice though they
be) are many times seen to go open- breasted as low as the
navel.”^</p></li>

<li><p>He thought those countries worst off that had most laws, and he
reckoned that France had had “more than the rest of the world besides.”
He saw no progress in the humaneness of the law, and doubted if any such
savagery could be found among barbarians as togaed judges and tonsured
ecclesiastics practiced in the torture chambers of European
states.®</p></li>
<li><p>Not that he lacked erotic hours; on the contrary, he acknowledges
premarital relations of proud scope and frequency.®^ He described sexual
love as no “other than a tickling delight of emptying one’s seminary
〔sic〕 vessels, as is the pleasure which nature giveth us to discharge
other parts”; and he thought it absurd that nature “hath pell - mell
lodged our joys and filths together.”®®</p></li>
<li><p>Marriage should be arranged by “a third hand”; it should reject
the com - pany and conditions of 〔sexual〕 love” and should try “to i

He inclined to the view of Greek thinkers that a man should not marry
before thirty. He avoided the tie as long as he could. Still single at
twenty-eight, he traveled to Paris, fell in love with it,^® enjoyed the
life of the court for a while (1562), saw some American Indians at
Rouen, hesitated between the rival charms of civilization and savagery,
returned to Bordeaux, and married (1565) Fran5oise de
Chassaigne.</p></li>

<li><p>He seems to have invented the term,®® almost the type; for though
there had been discorsi and discours, they were formidably formal, not
the informal, meandering conversations of Montaigne; and this easygoing,
buttonholing style has tended to characterize the essay since his death,
making it a predominantly modern genre. “I speak to paper,” he said, “as
I do to the first person I meet.”®^ The style is the man, natural,
intimate, con - fidential; it is a comfort to be spoken to so familiarly
by a seigneur of the mind. Open him at any page, and you are caught by
the arm and swept along, never knowing, and seldom caring, where you
will go. He wrote piecemeal, on any subject that struck his thought or
matched his mood; and he diverged anarchically from the initial topic as
he rambled on; so the essay “On Coaches” rattles off into ancient Rome
and new America. Of the three volumes, three consist of digressions.
Montaigne was lazy, and nothing is so arduous as producing and
maintaining order in ideas or men. He confessed himself divers et
ondoyant — wavering and diverse. He made no fetish of consistency; he
changed his opinions with his years; only the final composite picture is
Montaigne.</p></li>
<li><p>Nihil naturae alienum putat.</p></li>
<li><p>his fine dress, and his distinction as a Chevalier of St. Michael
— and wrote an essay “Of Vanity.” He pretends to most of the vices, and
assures us that if there is any virtue in him it entered by stealth. He
had many nevertheless: honesty, geniality, humor, equanimity, pity,
moderation, tolerance. He tossed explosive ideas into the air, but
caught and extinguished them before they fell. In an age of dogmatic
slaughter he begged his fellow men to moderate their certain- ties this
side of murder; and he gave the modern world one of its first examples
of a tolerant mind. We forgive his faults because we share them. And we
find his self-analysis fascinating because we know that it is about us
that the tale is told.</p></li>
<li><p>® In any case, it is the m ost destructive of Montaigne’s
compositions, perhaps the most thoroughgoing exposition of skepticism in
modern literature.</p></li>
<li><p>(Here, at the very outset of the Age of Reason, a generation
before Bacon and Descartes, Montaigne asks the question that they would
not stop to ask, that Pascal would ask eighty years later, that the
philosophers would not face till Hume and Kant: Why should we trust
reason?) Even instinct is a safer guide than reason. See how well the
animals get along by instinct — ^sometimes more wisely than men. “There
is a greater difference between many a man and many an - other man than
between many a man and m any an animal.”®® Man is no more the center of
life than the earth is the center of the universe. It is presumptuous of
man to think that God resembles him, or that human affairs are the
center of God’s interest, or that the world exists to serve man. And it
is ridiculous to suppose that the mind of man can fathom the nature of
God. “O senseless man, who cannot make a worm and yet will make gods by
the dozen!”®^</p></li>
<li><p>“There is no science,” only the proud hypotheses of immodest
minds.®</p></li>
<li><p>He compared t he morals of the Indians with those of their
conquerors, and charged that “the pretended Christians . . . brought the
contagion of vice to innocent souls eager to learn and by nature well
disposed.”®® For a moment Montaigne forgot his geniality and burs t into
noble indignation:</p></li>
<li><p>(He might seek another</p></li>
<li><p>So far as one reader can recall, he mentions Christ but once.®®
The lovely saga of the Mother of Christ made only a moderate appeal to
his unsentimental soul; however, he crossed Italy to lay four votive
figures before her shrine at Loreto. He lacked those marks of the
religious spirit — humility, a sense of sin, remorse and penance, a
longing for divine forgiveness and redeeming grace. He was a freethinker
with an allergy for martyrdom.</p></li>
<li><p>“in an age so corrupt and times so ignorant.” “Read all ancie nt
stories, be they never so tragical, you shall find none to equal those
we daily see practiced.”<sup>®</sup> He was not neutral in the duel for
France, but “my interest has not made me forget either the commendable
qualities of our adversaries or the reproach ful qualities of those whom
I have supported.”^®® He would not shoulder a gun, but his pen was with
the Politiques, those peace-preferring Catholics who advocated some
compromise with the Huguenots. He lauded Michel de L’Hopital for
farsighted humanitar ian moderation, and he rejoiced when his friend
Henry of Navarre moved to victory on the policies of L’Hopital.
Montaigne was the most civilized of Frenchmen in that savage
age.</p></li>
<li><p>® Meanwhile the customs officials had found a copy of the Essays,
which they turned over to the Inquisition. Montaigne was summoned to the
Holy Office and was gently admonished that some passages smelled of
heresy; would he not change or delete them in future editions? He
promised. “I thought I left them very well satisfied with me”; indeed,
they invited him to come and live in Rome. (He kept his promise
indifferently, and in 1676 his book was placed on the Index.) Perhaps to
reassure them and himself, he journeyed across Italy to the shrine of
the Virgin at Loreto and dedicated a votive tablet to her. Then he
recrossed the Apennines to take the waters at Lucca.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacon felt that influence, and Descartes may have found in the
Essays the stimulus to his initial universal doubt. Pascal went almost
insane trying to salvage his faith from Montaigne’s questionings. From
Montaigne stemmed Bayle,</p></li>

settled down in Rome, married at thirty-six a girl of seven- teen, and
spent ten years of happiness with her and his oils. Then (1640)
Richelieu and Louis XIII summoned him to Paris. “I shall go,” said
Poussin , “like one sentenced to be savm in half.”^^® He was given high
honors and a pension of a thousand crowns, but he was ill at ease in the
rancorous com- petition of the Parisian artists. Surrendering rich
prospects, he hurried back to Italy (1643). He bought a house on the
Pincian Hill, next to Claude Lorrain’s, and there he remained till his
death, quiet, domestic, absorbed, content.</p></li>

were sometimes voted upon groups of thirty, forty, or fifty at a

<li><p>Catholic opposition rose; when William’s army neared Brussels it
found the gates closed and the citizens armed to resist. Resuming its
march, it was but a league from Mons when it was surprised in its sleep
by six hundred Spanish soldiers; eight hundred of William’s men were
slaughtered before they could organize for defense; William himself
barely escaped, fleeing with a remnant of his forces to A-Iechlin in
Brabant. Meanwhile the murder of Coligny and the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew ended all hope of aid from France. On September 17 Mons
fell to Alva, who allowed Louis and his surviving troops to leave
unharmed; but Alva’s general, Philippe de Novarmes, on his own author -
ity, hanged hundreds of the inhabitants, confiscated their property, and
bought it in at bargain rates.®</p></li>

<li><p>William sent three thousand men to attack Don Federigo’s army;

After a siege of seven months, and after being reduced to eating weeds
and leather, the city surrendered ((July II, 1573). Of the garrison only
1,600 survived; most of these were put to death; four hundred leading
citizens were executed; the rest were spared on agreeing to pay a fine
of 250,000 guilders.</p></li>
<li><p>The Calvinists were (and till 1587 remained) only a tenth of the
population in the province of Holland, but they were active and
ambitious, and they were armed. They won control of the political
assemblies; they replaced Catholic with Protestant magistrates; in 1573
the Estates, or provincial council, forbade all Catholic worship in
Holland,^® on the ground that every Catholic was a potential servant of
Spain. By 1578 Calvinism was almost universal in Zeeland, and was
politically — not numerically — domi- nant in Friesland. Waves of
image-breaking swept over Holland and Zeeland in 1572, and after 1576 in
other provinces, even in Flanders and Brabant. All association of
religion with art was repudiated as idolatrous or profane. Churches were
stripped of pictures, statues, crucifixes, and decoration; gold and
silver vessels were melted down; bare walls re- mained. The Beggars
tortured Catholic priests and put some to death</p></li>

expressed his readiness to resign his offices, to with- draw from the

Protestantism, but only at sixty-two. He painted several religious
pictures, but he preferred genre and rriythologies, where he could bring
out the powerful heads and effulgent breasts of the men and women he had
seen in Antwerp homes, as in The King Drinks^ or, better, in The
Allegory of Fertility;^ her e, amid fruit (painted by Jacob’s friend

Paul was born. He was baptized by Lutheran rites, but while he was still
a child the family was converted to Catholicism. In 1578 Jan moved with
his family to Cologne, where he practiced law and prospered. When he
died (1587) Maria and the children went to live in Antwerp.</p></li>

<li><p>Peter and Isabella are pictured in the happiness of early
marriage: she hidden in overflowing robes and laced in flowered bodice,
her hand laid trustfully and possessively upon his, her proud face
rising out of an enormous blue ruff, her head crowned with a cavalier
hat; he in ripe manhood and success, with sturdy legs, blond beard,
handsome features, and ribboned hat. Isabella was allowed only seventeen
more years of life; but she gave him children whom he raised and por-
trayed lovingly; see the curlyheaded boy in the Berlin Kaiser-Friedrich

Congregation, and would perform the exercises prescribed by Ignatius
Loyola to cleanse the soul with visions of hell?®^ In March 1620 he con-
tracted with the Jesuits to design, before the end of the year,
thirty-nine pictures to cover the ceilings of the splendid baroque
church that they had begun to build in Antwerp in 1614. He made the
drawings, Vandyck and others turned these into paintings, nearly all of

St. Ildefonso in Brussels. In the central panel the Virgin, descended
from heaven, presents to the Arch- bishop of Toledo a chasuble direct
from Paradise; the saint is all humility, “breathless with adoration”;
while in the side panels Isabel and Albert lay aside their crowns and
kneel in prayer; here for a time Rubens gave life to piety. And in
St. Ambrose and the Emperor Theodosiu^’’ he caught and conveyed the
mysterious power and authority of the Church: the Archbishop of Milan,
armed only with priests and an acolyte, but with a head of majesty,
drives from the cathedral the Emperor backed with awesome guards but
burdened with unshriven cruelty. Rubens rarely failed with old men, for
in them, especially, the face is an autobiography, and offers visible
character to perceiving art. See the patriarch’s head in Lot and His
Family Leaving SodonF^ — one of the finest Rubens pictures in
America.</p></li>
<li><p>® These efforts failed; nevertheless Isabel persuaded Philip IV
to ennoble him (1624), and made him “Gentle - man of the Household of
Her Most Serene Highness” — i.e., herself. Later the King protested
against her employing “so mean 〔unpedi greed〕 a per- son” to receive
foreign envoys and discuss “affairs of such great impor - tance”;^® yet
Isabel sent Rubens to Madrid a year later (1628) to help arrange a peace
between Philip IV and Charles I. He took some of his paintings with him;
the King revised his notion of pedigree and sat to Rubens for five
portraits, as if VeMzquez were not making enough. The two artists became
good friends, the Spaniard, then twenty-nine, modestly deferring to the
genial Fleming, then fifty-one. Finally Philip appointed the “mean”
Rubens as his envoy to England. In London the artist success - fully
concluded a treaty of peace, despite the emissaries and the bribes of
Richelieu to the contrary. Rubens painted some English portraits — the
Duke and Duchess of Buckingham, and the magnificent face, beard, and
armor of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel.</p></li>

1630) with a degree from Cam- bridge and a knighthood from
Charles.</p></li>
<li><p>® death in Flemish society was an almost prohibitive luxury.
Rubens drowned his loneliness in diplomacy. In 1630, aged fifty-three,
he married Helena Fourment, aged sixteen. He needed beauty about him,
and she had already the warm coziness that filled his art and his
dreams. He painted her again and again, in every garb and none; in her
wedding costume,</p></li>
<li><p>holding a glove,</p></li>
<li><p>® hiding only her hips in a fur coat,</p></li>

selling shoddy materials to the Dutch army and navy defending
Holland;®’^ and such men labored zealously to prevent the outbreak of
peace.®®</p></li>
<li><p>® And yet can we call a culture commercial that so loved
cleanliness, tulips, music, and art, that set up a school in every
village and wiped out illiteracy, that created an intellectual
atmosphere electric with controversy and ideas, and allowed such freedom
of thought, speech, and press as soon made Holland the international
refuge of rebel minds? “There is no country,” said Descartes, “in which
freedom is more complete, se - curity greater, crime rarer, the
simplicity of ancient manners more per- fect than here.”®® And in 1660
another Frenchman wrote:</p></li>
<li><p>music, and domestic felicity. The Dutch “hold adultery in
horror,” wrote Lodovico Guicciardini. “Their women are ex - tremely

memorably in the Old Woman of the Vienna Gallery, worried and worn. In

amplitude. In July of that year she was summoned before the elders of
the parish church, was severely reprimanded for adultery, and was
excluded from the Sacrament. In October she bore him a child; Rem-
brandt acknowledged it as his and managed to get it safely baptized. He
learned to love his mistress as deeply as he had loved his wife; how
else could he have put such tenderness in her face when he painted her
in 1658 in the red robe that matched her hair?^^^ She was a good
stepmother to Titus, who was growing up into a bewitching lad. See him
in the Metro- politan Museum of Art, aged fourteen, as lovely as a girl,
with the wonder- ing eyes of youth, mystified by life and only half
secure under paternal love; or, again, in the Wallace Collection, a year
older. We can weakly imagine what a solace he must have been to
Rembrandt, who in this year found economic realities crashing about his
head.</p></li>

<li><p>® Men, rather than women, molded manners, except that Cecilia
Renata, who married Ladislas IV in 1637, refreshed the Italian
influences imported by artists and clergymen in earlier times; and
Louise Marie de Gonzague, whom he married in 1648, brought with her a
wave of French manners and speech that lasted till the twentieth
century. Polish dances had a grave grace that as early as 1647 led a
Frenchman to speak with admira- tion of the polonaise.</p></li>
<li><p>® Equally noted for its style was The Polish Courtier (1566), by
Lukasz Gornicki, an adaptation of Casti- glione’s Cortegiano. The Jesuit
Pet er Skargo was eminent in prose and verse, in education and politics.
He passed from the presidency of Wilno University to be for twenty-four
years the Bossuet of Poland as the lead- ing preacher at the royal
court; and he denounced without fear the cor- ruption that surrounded
him. He predicted that unless the nation could evolve a more stable and
centralized government it would fall a prey to foreign powers; but he
called for a responsible monarchy limited and re- strained by law. The
poetry of Jan Kochanowski remained unrivaled in his own field and tongue
till the nineteenth century, and is still popular today. He reached the
height of his inspiration in his treny (threnody or lament) for his
daughter Ursula, dead in the full charm of childhood.</p></li>
<li><p>Sigismund II granted a wide religious toleration. A year after

opposed by the episcopal members of the Diet, but it was unanimously

dissuading Philip from further enterprise against the main Turkish
power. He was involved in disputes with England and in the mess that
Alva was making in the Netherlands; he resented Venetian insistence on
monopolizing trade in the Adriatic, and he feared that another victory
over the Turks would rehabil- itate the crumbling empire of Venice and
strengthen her as a rival to Spain. Pius V, worn out with victory and
defeat, died on May i, 1572, and the Holy League died with him.</p></li>
<li><p>® When Chardin visited Isfahan in 1673 he was astonished to find
a great metropolis of administration, commerce, crafts, and arts, with
1,500 villages surrounding it and an urban population of 300,000 souls.
The city and its suburbs had 162 mosques, 48 colleges, 273 public baths,
and 1,800 cara- vanserais, or inns. Tavernier, seeing Isfahan in 1664,
described it as equaling Paris in extent, but only a tenth as populous,
for every family had its own house and garden, and there were so many
trees that it seemed “rather a forest than a city.”</p></li>

his own tribunal? God have pity on him!”^^ Many peasants went to work in
the bowels of the earth, but the profits and real wages of mining
declined as American silver entered Germany to compete with metal
laboriously extracted from ex- hausted lodes. In the towns the old guild
comradeship gave place to the exploitation of journeymen (day laborers)
by masters. In some industries the working day began at 4 a.m. and ended
at 7 p.m., with “breaks for beer”; the braziers’ guild exacted a ninety

<li><p>® After much travel in Germany he returned to Denmark, busied
himself with chemistry, and was brought back to astronomy by discovering
a new star in the constellation Cassiopeia (1572). His carefree
observations of this transitory star and his account of it in his first
publication, De nova Stella, gave him a European reputation, but shocked
some great Danes, who considered authorship a form of exhibitionism
incompatible with blue blood. Tycho confounded them by marrying a
peasant girl. He</p></li>

antiquity Hip- parchus (c. 130 B.c.) had questioned the opinion of
Aristotle “on bodies carried downward through weight”; and Joannes
Philoponus (533 a.d.), commenting on Aristotle, thought that the
difference in time of fall be- tween two objects one of which is twice
the weight of the other will be “either none at all or imperceptible.”®^
Here we come upon a famous and disputed story. It appears first in an
early biography of Galileo, written by his friend Vincenzo Viviani in
1654 (twelve years after Galileo’s death), and claiming to be founded on
Galileo’s own verbal account:</p></li>
<li><p>Un- certain, too, is the tradition concerning the resentment of
fellow professors at Pisa. He left that university in the summer of
1592, probably because he had been offered a loftier chair at a better
fee. In September we find him installed at the University of Padua,
teaching geometry, mechanics, and astronomy, and turning his home into a
laboratory to which he in- vited his students and friends. He avoided
marriage, but took a mistress, who gave him three children.</p></li>
<li><p>He hoped that in time these “secondary qualities” could be an -
alyzed into primary physical qualities of matter and motion,
mathematically measurable.®^</p></li>
<li><p>He was an ardent controversialist, skilled to spear a foe on a
phrase or roast him with burning indignation. In the margin of a book by
the Jesuit Antonio Rocco defending the Ptole- maic astronomy, Galileo
wrote, “Ignoramus, elephant, fool, dunce . . . eunuch.”®^</p></li>
<li><p>® Many theologians felt that the Copemican astronomy was so
clearly incompatible with the Bible that if it prevailed the Bible would
lose authority and Christianity itself would suffer. What would happen
to the fundamental Christian belief that God had chosen this earth as
His human home — ^this earth now to be shorn of its primacy and dignity,
to be set loose among planets so many times larger than itself, and
among innu- merable stars.^</p></li>
<li><p>® Cardinal Bellarmine was alarmed. Through common friends he sent
to Galileo a pointed admonition. “It seems to me,” he wrote to the
astronomer’s pupil Foscarini, “that you and Galileo would be well
advised to speak not in absolute terms 〔of the new astronomy as
proved〕 but ex suppositione, as I am convinced that Copernicus himself
did.”^</p></li>
<li><p>^ but Galileo refused, as he</p></li>
<li><p>while the earth ro- tates on its axis and revolves about the
sun.”<sup>®</sup> He went on to a broader heresy:</p></li>
<li><p>By the humor of history this is a proposition that no astronomer
holds today. Perhaps all astronomy, like all history, should be taken as
hypothesis. Of the beyond, as of j’ester- day, there is no
certainty.</p></li>
<li><p>®</p></li>
<li><p>®</p></li>
<li><p>® The Inquisition countered that Galile o’s dialogues made quite
clear his acceptance of Copernicus; Galileo insisted that he had been
anti-Copemican since 16 1 6. The Pope had kept in touch with the
examination, but had not attended in person. Galileo hoped that Urban
VIII would come to his aid, but the Pope refused to interfere. On June
22 the Inquisition pronounced him guilty of heresy and disobedience; it
offered him absolution on condition of full abjuration; it sentenced him
to “the prison of this Holy Office for a period determinable</p></li>

inherited the skill of the Italian dramatists, the scandal- ous hilarity
of the macaronic poets, the slashing satire of Bemi and Aretino. If
philosophy means calm perspective, reasoned restraint, ability to see

was not a philosopher but a warrior, who put on blinders lest
surrounding dangers should divert him from his goal — which was, two
centuries before Voltaire, e eraser Pinfdme, to smash the infamy of

<li><p>It may have been to conceal him self still further that he
changed his habitat twenty-four times in the next twenty years — from
Franeker to Amsterdam to Deventer to Amsterdam to Utrecht to Leiden, but
usually near a university or a library. His income allowed him to live
comfortably in a small chateau, with several servants. He avoided
marriage, but took a mistress (1634), who bore him a daughter. We are
pleased to hear that when this daughter died at the age of five,
Descartes wept humanly. We should err if we thought of him as coldly
unconcerned with mundane affairs. We shall find him justifying many of
the passions that moralists normally condemn. He had some himself, being

<li><p>he announced a first principle that in itself could have brought
the world of authority down upon his head; all the more so since the
essay was written in readily intelligible French, and in an animated,
captivating, first- person style; here were many revolutions! He would
begin, he said, by rejecting all doctrines and dogmas, putting aside all
authorities, especially of tile philosophus, the philosopher, Aristotle;
he would start with a clean slate and doubt everything — de omnibus
dubitandum. “The chief cause of our errors is to be found in the

<li><p>He hit upon it exultingly: Je pense, done je sun, Cogito ergo
sum, “I think, therefore I am”®^ — ^the most famous sentence in
philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>St. Augustine had used the same starting point in seeking to
refute the pagan skeptics, who profe ssed to doubt everything. But who
“doubts that he lives and thinks?” he asked. “For if he doubts, he
lives.”®® Montaigne used the same argument against the Pyrrhonists in
his “Apologie de Raimond Sebond.” Descartes had read Montaigne.</p></li>
<li><p>So the gap between mind and matter, subject and object, is
marvelously closed, and Descartes, by the help of God, becomes a
real-ist. Science itself — our confident belief in a logical, orderly,
law-abiding, calculable universe — be- comes possible only because God
exists and cannot lie.</p></li>
<li><p>^ His correspondence with Princess Palatine</p></li>
<li><p>He developed a theory of the emotions resembling that of William
James and Carl Lange: the external cause of the emotion (e/g., our sight
of a dangerous animal) automatically and simultaneously generates a
responsive action (flight) and the corresponding emotion (fear); the
emotion is the accompaniment, not the cause, of the action. The passions
are rooted in physiology and should be studied and explained as
mechanical operations. They are not in themselves bad, for they are the
wind in our sails; but when not moderated by reason they can enslave and
ruin a personality.</p></li>
<li><p>^ Huygens agreed with Hobbes, and thought that Descartes had
woven a romance out of metaphysical webs.</p></li>
<li><p>but after 1640 they withdrew their protection, and in 1663 they
were instrumental in having his works placed on the Index. Bossuet and
Fenelon welcomed Des- cartes’ proofs of the basic Christian beliefs, but
saw danger to faith in rest - ing it on reason. Pascal denounced the
reliance on reason as a reed shaken by the wind.</p></li>

son may take from me the life that in him I have spared. Sir, so much
foresight is too cautious; I cannot see evils at so great a distance. I
think what Troy used to be -so proud within its ramparts, so fertile in
heroes, mistress of Hither Asia; and then I behold its fate and destiny.
I see nothing but towers covered with sand, a river colored with blood,
fields deserted, a child in chains; and I cannot imagine that Troy in
this condition aspires to revenge. Ah, if the death of Hector’s son had
been promised, why have deferred it an entire year? Could we not have
immolated him on the breast of Priam? He might have been crushed under
Troy amid a thousand deaths. All might have been allowable then; old age
and infancy would in vain have sought in their weakness their defense;
victory and might, more cruel than ourselves, would have excited us to
murder in the confusion of our blows. Mv fury against the vanquished was
only too severe. But should my cruelty survive my wrath? Should I
leisurely bathe in the blood of a child despite the pity that I feel
rising in me? No, sir, let the Greeks seek another prey, let them pursue
elsewhere the relics of Troy; the course of my enmity is run. Epirus
will save that which Troy ha s preserved.”</p></li>

brighter by his glory, and these laurels still bearing witness to his
victories; all these eyes that we see come from all parts to unite upon
him alone their eager glances; this majestic bearing, this sweet
presence. Heaven, with what respect and what willingness all hearts
secretly assure him of their trust! Speak: can one see him without
thinking, with me, that in whatever obscurity fate had given him birth,
the world, beholding him, would have recognized its master?”</p></li>
<li><p>Racine, model of the classic style, rivaled the romantics in the
emotionalism of Phedra’s love, and Hippolytus (quite contrary to the
legend) bums for the Princess Aricia. Phedra learns of this passion, and
Racine gives us in excited detail a study of a woman scorned. He redeems
these romantic ecstasies with a powerful description of how the
frightened horses of Hippolytus dragged him to death.</p></li>
<li><p>Says Racine’s son: “He returned several times to the court, and
always had the honor of approaching his Majesty .” 24 Saint -Simon gives
a different account: Racine fell from favor by criticizing Scarron’s
comedies in the presence of Mm e. de Maintenon and the King. “At this

William goes to the city for business, leaving his wife, Alix, pregnant.
Her relative Andre warns her that, judging from the color of her
countenance, her child will be lacking an ear. He offers himself as a
surgeon, and explains that a bout of love will supply the missing
member. She accepts the prescription, and takes several doses, until the
thought occurs , to her that the child will have too many ears. When
William returns he restores the moral balance by seducing Andre’s wife .

these romantic proliferations the characters, under pseudonyms,

peddling their wares in baskets, pushcarts, or wheelbarrows, or criers
offering various household services, such as “rats or mice to kill.” 77
Beggars and thieves were every - where, but there were also street
singers ballading for pence. The business center, called “the City,” was
governed by a lord mayor, a board of aider - men, and a common council,
elected by the householders of the wards. West of this lay the political
center, Westminster — with Westminster Abbey, Westminster Palace (where
Parliament met), and the royal palaces of Whitehall and St. James.
Outside of these lay the slum districts, pullulat- ing with the fertile
poor. There were no pavements there, and coaches proudly splashed with
rain water or mud the pedestrians hugging the walls in narrow streets.
Houses there were so close together, with upper stories almost meeting,
that the sun had little chance to spread its fitful light. There were no

carried off refuse and dumped it beyond the city limits, or

the “humanities” — the studies favored by the Renaissance humanists. It
in- cluded also dancing, riding, wrestlin g, fencing, and even “a manual
trade, nay two or three,” but as helps to health and character, not as
means of livelihood. The arts were to be taught as recreations, not as
professions; the young gentleman was not to take such affairs very
seriously; he should enjoy poetry, but not write it except as a pastime;
he should be taught to enjoy music, but not to seek proficiency on any
instrument; this would take too much time, and, besides, it would put
the youth into “such odd company.” So Locke’s treat ise was both
conservative and liberal. In its repudiation of Scholastic absorption in
ancient languages, its lessened stress on religion and theology, its
emphasis on health and character, and its effort to prepare well-born
youth for public life and service, it pointed to the future, and had
immense influence in England and America. It shared in forming the

<li><p>After many trials, Huygens constructed a successful marine clock
by substituting for the pendulum a balance wheel worked by two springs.
This was among the illuminating suggestions expounded by him in one of
the classics of modern science, the Horologium oscillatorium (The
Pendulum Clock ) published in Paris in 1673. Three years later Hooke
invented the anchor escapement of clocks, applied spiral springs to the
balance wheel of watches, and expounded the action of the springs on the
principle Ut tensio sic vis — “As the tension, so the force”; this is
still called Hooke’s law. Pocket watches could now be made more
competently and cheaply than before.</p></li>
<li><p>Leonardo da Vinci, about 1500, made drawings of a pendulum and an
escapement mechanism. Galileo formulated some laws of the pendulum, and
conceived the idea of a pendulum clock in 1641, but he died before
applying the idea in practice. Camerini in 1656 made a small pendulum
clock just a few months before Huygens.</p></li>

matter as our confused perception of the operations of force. Like our

Newton; motion, said Leibniz, “is simply change in the relative position
of bodies, and thus is nothing absolute, but consists in a relation.” 76
Anticipating Kant, he interpreted space and time not as ob - jective
realities but as perceptual relations: space as perceived coexistence,
time as perceived succession — views adopted in relativity theories
today. In his final year (1715) Leibniz entered into a long

except by private violence. When the inhabitants of the highlands
suffered from drought, the lowlanders let them starve; when the
lowlanders suffered from flood the highlanders let them starve. Soon the
tribe died out. Two families survived by emigration; they prac- ticed
mutual aid, raised their children in religion and virtue, and “looked
upon themselves as one single family; their flocks were almost always
in- termixed .” 61 But as they increased in number they f ound their

a lead to Gibbon and Renan in naming that period the noblest and

Montesquieu found the ethics of the Stoics, which he clearly preferred

he was released. In 1757 he was sent to England to seek his fortune in
music. At Bath, which then rivaled London as a center of fashionable
society, he rose from oboist to conductor to organist in the Octagon
Chapel. He composed, taught music, and sometimes gave thirty-five
lessons in a week. At night he un- bent by studying calculus; thence he
passed to optics, finally to astronomy. He brought over from Germany his

astronomic latitude on an arc of the meridian at a place as near as
practicable to the Arctic Circle. It reported that the length of a
degree there was 367,100 feet — a little more than sixty-nine miles.
These findings indicated that the length of a degree of astronomic
latitude in- creased slightly as the observer moved from the equator
toward the pole; and the increase was interpreted as due to the polar
flattening of the earth. The Academie des Sciences conceded that Newton

Grimm, Helvetius, and d’Holbach phi - losophes ; but we shall not so
term Rousseau — though we should call him a philosopher, if only because
he gave a reasoned argument in defense of feeling and faith. We must
also allow for the fact that a philosophe might oppose all the religions
around him, and yet, like Voltaire, consistently and to the end profess
belief in God. The debate that agitated the intel- lectual classes in
the half century before the Revolution was not quite a conflict between
religion and philosophy; it was primarily a conflict between the
philosophes and Catholic Christianity as it then existed in France. It
was the pent-up wrath of the French mind after centuries in which
religion had sullied its services with obscurantism, persecution, and
massacre. The reaction went to extremes, but so had the Massacre of

Encyclopedic under governmental pro- tection at St. Petersburg; a
similar offer came from Frederick the Great through Voltaire; perhaps
these proposals persuaded the French officials to allow the printing in
Paris. The final volume of text appeared in 1765; eleven volumes of
plates were added between 1765 and 1772. A five- volume Supplement and a
two-volume Table generate (index) were issued between 1776 and 1780.
