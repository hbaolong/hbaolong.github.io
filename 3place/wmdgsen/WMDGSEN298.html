<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>The Talmud</p>
<p>I. THE EXILES: 1 35-565</p>
<p>W ITHIN Islam and Christendom a remarkable people maintained</p>
<p>through every adversity its own unique culture, consoled and in-</p>
<p>spired by its own creed, living by its own laws and morality,
producing its own poets, scientists, scholars, and philosophers, and
serving as the living carriers of fertile seeds between two hostile
worlds.</p>
<p>The rebellion of Bar Cocheba ( 1 3 2-5 ) was not the last effort of
the Jews to regain for Judea the freedom that Pompey and Titus had
destroyed. Under Antoninus Pius ( 138-61) they tried again, and failed.
Their holy city was forbidden them except on the bitter anniversary of
its destruction, when they were allowed, for a consideration, to come
and mourn by the walls of their shattered Temple. In Palestine, where
985 towns had been wiped out, and 580,000 men and women had been slain,
in Bar Cocheba’s revolt, the Jewish population had sunk to half its
former volume, and to such an abyss of poverty that cultural life was
almost wholly dead. Nevertheless, within a generation after Bar Cocheba,
the Beth Din or Jewish National Council — a court of seventy-one
rabbinical scholars and legists — was established in Ti- berias,
synagogues and schools were opened, and hope rose again.</p>
<p>The triumph of Christianity brought new difficulties. Before his
conver- sion Constantine had placed the religion of the Jews on a
footing of legal equality with those of his other subjects. After his
conversion the Jews were oppressed with new restrictions and exactions,
and Christians were forbidden to associate with them. 1 Constantius
banished the rabbis (337), and made the marriage of a Jew with a
Christian woman a capital crime. 2 Julian’s brot her Gallus taxed the
Jews so heavily that many of them sold their children to meet his
demands. In 352 they rebelled again, and were again suppressed;
Sepphoris was razed to the ground, Tiberias and other cities were partly
de- stroyed, thousands of Jews were killed, thousands were enslaved. The
con- dition of the Palestinian Jews now (359) sank so low, and their
communi- cation with other Jewish communities was so difficult, that
their patriarch Hillel II resigned their right to determine for all Jews
the dates of the Jewish festivals, and issued, for the independent
computation of these dates, a calen- dar that remains in use among the
Jews of the world to this day.</p>
<p>From these afflictions the Jews were saved for a moment by the
accession of Julian. He reduced their taxes, revoked discriminatory
laws, lauded He-</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>brew charity, and acknowledged Yahveh as “a great god.” He asked
Jewish leaders why they had abandoned animal sacrifice; when they
replied that their law did not permit this except in the Temple at
Jerusalem, he ordered that the Temple should be rebuilt with state
funds. 3 Jerusalem was again opened to the Jews; they flocked to it from
every quarter of Palestine, from every province of the Empire; men,
women, and children gave their labor to the rebuilding, their savings
and jewelry to the furnishing, of the new Tem- ple; 4 we can imagine the
happiness of a people that for three centuries had prayed for this day
(361). But as the foundations were being dug, flames burst from the
ground, and burnt several workmen to death. 5 The work was patiently
resumed, but a repetition of the phenomenon — probably due to the
explosion of natural gas — interrupted and discouraged the enterprise.
The Christians rejoiced at what seemed a divine prohibition; the Jews
marveled and mourned. Then came Julian’s sudden death; state funds were
withdrawn; the old restrictive laws were re-enacted and made more
severe; and the Jews, again excluded from Jerusalem, returned to their
villages, their poverty, and their prayers. Soon thereafter Jerome
reported the Jewish population of Pal- estine as “but a tenth part of
their previous multitude.” 6 In 425 Theodosius II abolished the
Palestinian patriarchate. Greek Christian churches replaced the
synagogues and schools; and after a brief outburst in 614, Palestine
sur- rendered its leadership of the Jewish world.</p>
<p>The Jews could hardly be blamed if they hoped to fare better in less
Chris- tian lands. Some moved east into Mesopotamia and Persia, and
reinvigorated that Babylonian Jewry which had never ceased since the
Captivity of 597 b.c. In Persia too the Jews were excluded from state
office; but as all Persians except the nobility were likewise excluded,
there was less offense in the re- striction. 7 And there were several
persecutions of Jews in Persia. But taxation was less severe, the
government was normally co-operative, and the exilarch, or head of the
Jewish community, was recognized and honored by the Per- sian kings. The
soil of Iraq was then irrigated and fertile; the Jews there be- came
prosperous farmers as well as clever traders. Some, including famous
scholars, grew rich by brewing beer. 8 The Jewish communities in Persia
mul- tiplied rapidly, for Persian law permitted, and the Jews practiced,
polygamy, for reasons that we have seen under Mohammedan law. The good
rabbis Rab and Nahman, when traveling, were accustomed to advertise in
each city for temporary wives, to give local youth an exemplar of
matrimonial, as against a promiscuous, life. 9 In Nehardea, Sura, and
Pumbeditha schools of higher education rose, whose scholarship and
rabbinical decisions were honored throughout the Dispersion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dispersion of the Jews continued through all the
Mediter- ranean lands. Some went to join old Jewish communities in Syria
and Asia</p>
<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>Minor. Some went to Constantinople despite the hostility of Greek
emperors and patriarchs. Some turned south from Palestine into Arabia,
dwelt in peace and religious freedom with their Arab fellow-Semites,
occupied whole re- gions like Khaibar, almost equaled the Arabs in
Yathrib (Medina), made many converts, and prepared the Arab mind for the
Judaism of the Koran. Some crossed the Red Sea into Abyssinia, and
multiplied so rapidly there that in 3 15 they were reputed to be half
the population. 10 Jews controlled half the shipping of Alexandria, and
their prosperity in that excitable city fed the flames of religious
animosity.</p>
<p>Jewish communities developed in all the North African cities, and in
Sicily and Sardinia. In Italy they were numerous; and though
occasionally harassed by the Christian population, they were for the
most part protected by pagan emperors, Christian emperors, Theodoric,
and the Popes. In Spain there had been Jewish settlements before Caesar,
and they had developed there without molestation under the pagan Empire;
they prospered under the Arian Visi- goths, but suffered disheartening
persecutions after King Recared (58 6-60 1 ) adopted the Nicene Creed.
We hear of no persecution of Jews in Gaul until the severe enactments of
the third and fourth Councils of Orleans (538, 541 ), a generation after
the conquest of Arian Visigothic Gaul by the ortho- dox Christian
Clovis. About 560 the Christians of Orleans burned down a synagogue. The
Jews petitioned Gunthram, King of the Franks, to rebuild it at public
cost, as Theodoric in like case had done. Gunthram refused. “O King
glorious f or wonderful wisdom!” exclaimed Bishop Gregory of</p>
<p>Tours. 11</p>
<p>From such tribulations the Jews of the Dispersion always recovered.
Pa- tiently they rebuilt their synagogues and their lives; toiled,
traded, lent money, prayed and hoped, increased and multiplied. Each
settlement was re- quired to maintain at communal expense at least one
elementary and one sec- ondary school, both of them usually in the
synagogue. Scholars were advised not to live in any town that lacked
such schools. The language of worship and instruction was Hebrew; the
language of daily speech was Aramaic in the East, Greek in Egypt and
Eastern Europe; elsewhere the Jews adopted the language of the
surrounding population. The central theme of Jewish education was
religion; secular culture was now almost ignored. Dispersed Jewry could
maintain itself, in body and soul, only through the Law; and religion
was the study and observance of the Law. The faith of their fathers
became more precious to the Jews the more it was attacked; and the
Talmud and the synagogue were the indispensable support and refuge of an
oppressed and bewildered people whose life rested on hope, and their
hope on faith in their God.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MAKERS OF THE TALMUD</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Temple, the synagogues, and the schools of Palestine and
Babylonia the scribes and the rabbis composed those enormous bodies of
law and com- mentary known as the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds.
Moses, they held, had left to his people not only a written Law in the
Pentateuch, but also an oral Law, which had been handed down and
expanded from teacher to pupil, from generation to generation. It had
been the main point of issue be- tween the Pharisees and the Sadducees
of Palestine whether this oral Law was also of divine origin and binding
force. As the Sadducees disappeared after the Dispersion of a.d. 70, and
the rabbis inherited the tradition of the Pharisees, the oral Law was
accepted by all orthodox Jews as God’s com - mandment, and was added to
the Pentateuch to constitute the Torah or Law by which they lived, and
in which, quite literally, they had their being. The thousand-year-long
process by which the oral Law was built up, given form, and put into
writing as the Mishna; the eight centuries of debate, judgment, and
elucidation that accumulated the two Gemaras as commentaries on the
Mishna; the union of the Mishna with the shorter of these Gemaras to
make the Palestinian, and with the longer to make the Babylonian, Talmud
— this is one of the most complex and astonishing stories in the history
of the human mind. The Bible was the literature and religion of the
ancient Hebrews; the Torah was the life and blood of the medieval
Jews.</p>
<p>Because the Law of the Pentateuch was written, it could not meet all
the needs and circumstances of a Jerusalem without freedom, or a Judaism
with- out Jerusalem, or a Jewry without Palestine. It was the function
of the Sanhe- drin teachers before the Dispersion, and of the rabbis
after it, to interpret the legislation of Moses for the use and guidance
of a new age or place. Their in- terpretations and discussions, with
majority and minority opinions, were transmitted from one generation of
teachers to another. Perhaps to keep this oral tradition flexible,
possibly to compel its memorizing, it was not written down. The rabbis
who expounded the Law might on occasion call in the help of persons who
had accomplished the feat of committing it to memory. In the first six
generations after Christ the rabbis were called tannaim — “teachers of
the oral Law.” As the sole experts in the Law, they were at once the
teachers and the judges of their communities in Palestine after the fall
of the Temple.</p>
<p>The rabbis of Palestine and of the Dispersion constituted the most
unique aristocracy in history. They were no closed or hereditary class;
many of them rose from the poorest ranks; most of them earned their
living as artisans even after achieving international repute; and until
near the end of this period they received no payment for their work as
teachers and judges. Rich men sometimes made them silent partners in
business enterprises, or took them</p>
<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>351</p>
<p>into their homes, or married their daughters to them to free them
from toil. A few of them were spoiled by the high status accorded to
them in their communities; some were humanly capable of anger, jealousy,
hatred, undue censoriousness, pride; they had frequently to remind
themselves that the true scholar is a modest man, if only because wisdom
sees the part in the light of the whole. The people loved them for their
virtues and their faults, admired them for their learning and their
devotion, and told a thousand stories about their judgments and their
miracles. To this day no people so honors the stu- dent and the scholar
as do the Jews.</p>
<p>As rabbinical decisions accumulated, the task of memorizing them
became unreasonable. Hillel, Akiba, and Meir attempted various
classifications and mnemonic devices, but none of these received general
acceptance. Disorder in the transmission of the Law became the order of
the day; the number of men who knew the entire oral Law by heart was
dangerously reduced, and dispersion was scattering these few to distant
lands. About the year 1 89, at Sepphoris in Palestine, Rabbi Jehuda
Hanasi took over and transformed the work of Akiba and Meir, rearranged
the whole oral Law, and wrote it down, with some personal additions, as
the “Mishna of Rabbi Jehuda.” * It was so widely read that it became in
time the Mishna, the authoritative form of the oral Law of the Jews.</p>
<p>As we have it, the Mishna (i.e., oral teaching) is the result of much
editing and interpolation since Jehuda; even so it is a compact summary,
designed for memorizing by repetition, and therefore tantalizingly terse
and obscure to one who comes to it from any background except that of
Jewish life and history. Babylonian and European as well as Palestinian
Jews accepted it, but each school placed upon its maxims an individual
interpretation. As six “generations” (a.d. 10 -220) of rabbinical
tannaim had shared in formulating the Mishna, so now six “generations”
(220 - 500) of rabbinical amoraim (“ex - pounders”) accumulated those
two masses of commentary, the Palesti nian and the Babylonian Gemaras.
The new teachers did to the Mishna of Jehuda what the tannaim had done
to the Old Testament: they debated, analyzed, explained, amended, and
illustrated the text to apply it to the new problems and circumstances
of their place and time. Towards the end of the fourth century the
schools of Palestine co-ordinated their commentaries in the form known
as the Palestinian Gemara. About the same time (397) Rab (Rabbi) Ashi,
head of the Sura college, began to codify the Babylonian Gemara, and
worked on it for a generation; a hundred years later (499) Rabina II bar
(son of) Samuel, also at Sura, brought this work to completion. If we
note that the Babylonian Gemara is eleven times as long as the Mishna,
we shall</p>

minority of scholars holds that Jehuda did not commit his Mishna to
writing, and that it was orally transmitted till the eighth century. For
the majority opinion, cf. G. F. Moore, Judaism in the First Centuries of
the Christian Era , Cambridge, Mass., 1932, Vol. I, p. 15 1; and W. O.

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>begin to understand why its compilation spanned a century. Through an
ad- ditional 150 years (500- 650) rabbinical saboraim (“reasoners”)
revised this vast commentary, and gave the finishing touches to the
Babylonian Talmud.</p>
<p>The word talmud means teaching. Among the amoraim it was applied only
to the Mishna; in modern usage it includes both the Mishna and the
Gemara. The Mishna is the same in both the Palestinian and the
Babylonian Talmuds; the two differ only in the Gemara or commentary,
which is four times longer in the Babylonian than in the Palestinian
form.* The language of the two Gemaras is Aramaic; that of the Mishna is
Neo-Hebraic, with many borrow- ings from neighbor languages. The Mishna
is concise, stating a law in a few lines; the Gemaras are deliberately
discursive, giving the diverse opinions of leading rabbis on the Mishna
text, describing the circumstances that might require modification of
the law, and adding illustrative material. The Mishna is mostly halacha,
law; the Gemaras are partly halacha — restating or discuss- ing a law —
and partly haggad a (“story”). Haggada has been lazily defined as
anything in the Talmud that is not halacha. For the most part haggada
in- cludes illustrative anecdotes or examples, bits of biography,
history, medi- cine, astronomy, astrology, magic, and theosophy, and
exhortations to Virtue and obedience to the Law. Often a haggada
relieved the minds of the students after some complex and tiring debate.
So, we read,</p>
<p>Rab Ami and Rab Assi were conversing with Rabbi Isaac Napcha,</p>
<p>when one of them said to him: “Tell us, sir, some pretty legend”; and
the other said: “Pray explain to us, rather, some nice point of
law.”</p>
<p>When he began the legend he displeased the one, and when he began to
explain a point of law he offended the other. Whereupon he took up this
parable: “I am like the man with the two wives, the one young and the
other old. The young one plucked out all his gray hairs, that he might
look young; the old wife pulled out all his black hairs, that</p>
<p>he might look old; and so between the two he became bald. So it
is</p>
<p>with me between you.” 13</p>

Babylonian Talmud runs to 2947 folio leaves, or some 6000 pages of 400
words each. The Mishna is divided into six sedarim (orders), each of
these into masechtoth (tractates) totaling sixty-three, each of these
into perakim (chapters), each of these into mishnayoth (teachings).
Modern editions of th^ Talmud usually include: (i) the commentary of
Rashi (1040-1 105), which appears on the interior margins of the text;
and (2) tosaphoth (additions), discussions of the Talmud by French and
German rabbis of the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies, which appear on
the exterior margins of the text. Many editions add the Tosefta or
Supplement — remnants of the oral law omitted from the Mishna of Jehuda
Hanasi.</h1>
<p>This chapter will also quote from the Midrash (exposition), addresses
allegedly given by tannaim or amoraim, but assembled and committed to
writing between the fourth and the twelfth century, and expounding in
popular style various books of the Hebrew Scriptures. Some of the major
Midrashim: Genesis Rabbah, on Genesis; Wayyikrah Rabbah, on Leviticus;
five Megilloth (scrolls) — on Esther, the Song of Songs, Ruth,
Lamentations, and Ecclesiasticus; the Mechilta, on Exodus; the Sifra, on
Leviticus; the Sifre, on Numbers and Deuteronomy; the Pesikta, homilies
on passages from the Bible. 12</p>

<li>THE LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>If now, with offensive brevity and ecumenical ignorance, we attempt
to sketch some phases of this immense Talmud that entered into every
cranny of medieval Hebrew life, let us confess that we are but
scratching a moun- tain, and that our external approach condemns us to
error.</p>

<li>Theology</li>
</ol>
<p>First, said the rabbis, one must study the Law, written and oral.
“Greater - municated to Moses by God, and by Moses to his successors;
and its decrees are as binding as anything in the Scriptures, t Some
rabbis ranked the Mishna above the Scriptures in authority, as being a
later and revised form of the Law. 18 Certain rabbinical edicts frankly
voided laws of the Pentateuch, or interpreted them into harmlessness. 19
During the Middle Ages (476-1492) the Jews of Germany and France studied
the Talmud far more than the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The Talmud, like the Bible, takes for granted the existence of an
intelli- gent and omnipotent God. There were occasional skeptics among
the Jews, like the learned Elisha ben Abuyah whom the pious Rabbi Meir
befriended; but they were apparently a tiny and hardly vocal minority.
The Talmud’s God is frankly anthropomorphic: He loves and hates, gets
angry, 20 laughs, 21 weeps, 22 feels remorse, 23 wears phylacteries, 24
sits on a throne surrounded</p>

of the universe depends upon the moral law; Heracleitus’ comparison of
planetary deviations to sins; and Plato’s divine archetypal “ideas.” The
theory goes back to Prov. viii, 22. Jesus accepted the eternity of the
Law (Luke xvii, 7; Matt, v, 18). The Moslems, not to be outdone, taught
the eternity of the Koran.</p>

<p>by a ministering hierarchy of cherubim and seraphim, and studies the
Torah three times a day . 25 The rabbis acknowledged that these human
attributes were a bit hypothetical; “we borrow terms from His creatures
to apply to Him,” they said, “in order to assist the understanding”; 28
it was not their - cendent and immanent, above the world and yet present
in every nook and fragment of it. This universal divine presence, the
Shekinah (dwelling), is especially real in sacred places, persons, and
things, and in moments of study or prayer. Nevertheless this omnipresent
God is one. Of all ideas the most distasteful to Judaism is that of a
plurality of gods. The unity of God is pas- sionately reiterated against
the polytheism of the pagans and the apparent tritheism of the Christian
Trinity; it is proclaimed in the most famous and universal of Jewish
prayers, the Shema Yisrael: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the
Lord is one” {Shema Yisrael adonoi elohenu, adonoi ehad) , 27 No
messiah, no prophet, no saint is to have a place beside Him in His
temple or worship. The rabbis forbade, except on rare occasions, the
utterance of His name, hoping to deter profanity and magic; to avoid the
sacred tetra- grammaton JHVH they used the word Adonai, Lord, and
recommended even for this such substitutions as “The Holy One,” “The
Merciful One,” “The Heavens,” and “Our Father which is in heaven.” God
can and does work miracles, especially through great rabbis; but these
marvels are not to be thought of as infractions of nature’s laws; there
are no laws but the will of God.</p>
<p>Everything created has a divine and beneficent purpose. “God created

<p>Sin is natural, but its guilt is not inherited. The rabbis accepted
the doctrine of the fall of man, but not of original sin or divine
atonement. A man suffers only for his own sins. If he suffers more on
earth than his sins seem to warrant, that may be because we do not know
the full measure of his sins; or such ex-</p>

<p>cess of punishment may be a great blessing, as entitling the sufferer
to excep- tional rewards in heaven; therefore, said Akiba, a man should
rejoice in the multitude of his misfortunes . 33 As for death, it came
into the world through sin; a really sinless person would never die . 34
Death is a debt owed by a sinful humanity to the author of all life. A
midrash tells a touching story of death and Rabbi Meir:</p>
<p>While Rabbi Meir was holding his weekly discourse on a Sabbath</p>
<p>afternoon, his two beloved sons died suddenly at home. Their mother
covered them with a sheet, and forbore to mourn on the sacred day. When
Rabbi Meir returned after evening services he asked for his</p>
<p>sons, whom he had not seen in the synagogue. She asked him to recite
the habdalah 〔a ceremony marking the close of the Sabbath〕, and</p>
<p>gave him his evening meal. Then she said: “I have a question to
ask</p>
<p>thee. A friend once gave me jewels to keep for him; now he wishes</p>
<p>them again; shall I return them?” “Beyond doubt thou must,” said</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir. His wife took him by the hand, led him to the bed,
and</p>
<p>drew back the sheet. Rabbi Meir burst into bitter weeping, and
his</p>
<p>wife said: “They were entrusted to us for a time ; now their
Master</p>
<p>has taken back His very own .” 35</p>
<p>The Hebrew Scriptures had said little of an immortality of reward and
punishment; but that idea now played a major role in rabbinical
theology. Hell was pictured, at Ge Hinnom or Sheol,* and divided like
heaven into seven stories, with graduated degrees of torment. Only the
most wicked of the circumcised would enter it , 36 and even confirmed
sinners would not be punished forever. “All who go down to hell shall
come up again, except these three: he who commits adultery, he who
shames another in public, and he who gives another a bad name.” 37
Heaven was called Gan Eden, and was represented as a garden of every
physical and spiritual delight; the wine there would be of a vintage
preserved from the six days of the creation; perfumes would bless the
air; and God Himself would join the saved in a banquet whose supreme joy
would be the sight of His face. However, some rabbis confessed that no
man can say what lies beyond the grave . 38</p>
<p>The Jews thought of salvation in terms of the nation rather than of
the individual. Driven across the earth with apparently irrational
ruthlessness, they strengthened themselves with the belief that they
were still the chosen and favored people of God. He was their father,
and a just God; it could not be that He would break covenant with
Israel. Was it not to them that He had given those Scriptures which both
the Christians and the Moslems accepted and revered? In the depths of
their despair they mounted to such compensa- tory pride that their
rabbis, who had exalted them, had to humble them with</p>

fires were kept constantly burning to prevent pestilence. Sheol was

<p>reproof. Then, as now, they longed for the land of their nation’s
birth, and idealized it in loving memory. “He who walks four ells in
Palestine is sure of eve rlasting life,” they said; “he who lives in
Palestine is without sin”; 39 “even the merest talk of those who dwell
in Palestine is Torah.” 40 The cen - tral part of the daily prayers, the
Shemoneh Esreh (“eighteen paragraphs”), included a petition for the
coming of the son of David, the Messiah King who would make the Jews a
nation again, united, free, worshiping God in their own Temple with the
ancient ritual and song.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Ritual</li>
</ol>
<p>What distinguished the Jews in this Age of Faith, what kept them one
in their scattering, was not theology but ritual, not a creed that
Christianity had merely extended and that Islam would substantially
adopt, but a ceremonial law of such burdensome complexity that only this
proud and high-strung people showed the humility and patience required
to obey it. Christianity sought unity through uniform belief, Judaism
through uniform ritual. The laws “were given,” said Abba Areca, “only
for the purpose of disciplining and refining men by their observance.”
41</p>
<p>The ritual was first of all a law of worship. When the synagogue
succeeded the Temple, animal sacrifice was replaced by offerings and
prayer. But no more in the synagogue than in the Temple was any image of
God or man allowed. Every approach to idol worship was shunned; and
instrumental music, permitted in the Temple, was forbidden in the
synagogue. Here Christianity diverged, Mohammedanism stemmed, from
Judaism; the Sem- ites developed a somber piety, the Christians a somber
art.</p>
<p>Prayer made every day, almost every hour, a religious experience for
the orthodox Jew. Morning prayers were to be said with phylacteries
(small cases containing passages from the Scriptures) affixed to the
forehead and the arms. No meal was to be eaten without a brief grace
before it, and a longer prayer of thanksgiving at its close. But these
domestic prayers were not enough; men can be held together only by doing
things together; and the rabbis argued, with Oriental hyperbole, that “a
man’s prayer is heard by God only when o ffered in a synagogue.” 42 The
public liturgy consisted mainly of the Shemoneh Esreh, the Shema
Yisrael, readings from the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Psalms, a
homily of Scriptural explanation, the Kaddish (prayers of praise and
blessing for the living and the dead) , and a concluding benediction.
This remains the essential synagogue ritual to the present day.</p>
<p>Far more detailed than these regulations of worship were the rules
for cleanliness or ritual purity. Physical hygiene was considered
favorable to spiritual health . 43 The rabbis forbade living in a city
in which there was no bathhouse , 44 and gave almost medical
instructions for the bath. “If one bathes</p>
<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>with hot water, and does not follow it with cold water, it is like
iron which is inserted into a furnace and not afterward plunged into
cold water”; 45 the body, like the iron, must be tempered and steeled.
Anointing should follow the bath. 46 Hands were to be washed immediately
upon rising, before and after each meal, and before ceremonial prayer or
any other ritual observance. Corpses, sexual functions, menstruation,
childbirth, vermin, pigs, and leprosy (i.e., various skin diseases) were
ritually (i.e., by religious law) unclean. Per- sons touched or affected
by any of these were to go to the synagogue and perform a purification
ceremonial. A woman was considered unclean (not to be sexually
approached) for forty days after bearing a son, eighty days after
bearing a daughter. 47 In accord with the Biblical injunction
(Gen. xvii, 9-14), a boy was to be circumcised on his eighth day. This
was represented as a sacrifice to, and a covenant with, Yahveh; but the
prevalence of the cus- tom among Egyptians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians,
Syrians, and Arabs suggests that it was a hygienic measure indicated in
a climate more favorable to sexual precocity and excitability than to
cleanliness; and this conclusion is rein- forced by the rabbinical
command that no Jew should keep beyond twelve months an uncircumcised
slave. 48</p>
<p>The Talmud occasionally reads like a manual of home medicine rather
than a code of religious laws; it had to be an encyclopedia of advice
for its people. The Jews of the fourth and fifth centuries, like most
Mediterranean peoples, were slipping back into the medical superstitions
and makeshifts of the isolated and the poor; and a good deal of this
popular and superstitious medicine entered into the Talmud. Nevertheless
we find in the Babylonian Gemara excellent descriptions of the
esophagus, larynx, trachea, lungs, me- ninges, and genitals; tumors of
the lungs, cirrhosis of the liver, caseous degen- eration, and many
other diseases are accurately described; the rabbis note that flies and
drinking cups may carry infection; 49 and hemophilia is recog- nized as
an hereditary ailment making circumcision of the offspring inadvisa-
ble. Mingled with these ideas are magical formulas for exorcising demons
supposed to cause disease.</p>
<p>The rabbis, like all of us, were experts on diet. Dietary wisdom
begins with the teeth. These should never be extracted, no matter how
they ache, 50 for “if a man chews well with his teeth his feet will find
strength.” 51 Vegetables</p>
<p>35§ THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>only; “don’t peck all day like hens.” 55 “More people die from
overeating than from undernou rishment.” 50 “Up to forty eating is
beneficial; after that age, drinking is beneficial.” 57 Moderation in
drinking is better than total ab - stinence; wine is often a good
medicine , 58 and “there is no gladness without it.” 89 Pursuing the
subject of diet to its end, the rabbis argued that he “who prolongs his
stay in a privy lengthens his years,” and recommended a prayer of
thanksgiving after every answer to nature’s call . 60</p>
<p>They frowned upon asceticism, and counseled their people to enjoy the
good things of life where no sin was involved . 01 Fasts were obligatory
at cer- tain periods and on some holydays; but perhaps here too religion
was used as a prod to health. The wisdom of the race bade the Jews keep
festival and make feast now and then, despite the overtones of sorrow
and longing that sounded even in their joys. “On a festival a man must
make glad his wife and household”; if possible he must outfit them with
new clothes . 62 The Sabbath</p>
<p>Many holydays divided the year, and gave new occasions for pious re-
membrance or grateful rest. Pesach, beginning on the fourteenth of Nisan
(April), commemorated through eight days the escape of the Jews from
Egypt. In Biblical times it had been called the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, be- cause the Jews had fled with the dough of their bread still
unleavened; Tal- mudic times called it Pesach, i.e., Passover, because
Yahveh, smiting the first- born of the Egyptians, “passed over” those
houses whose doorposts had been sprinkled, by the Jewish occupants, with
the blood of the lamb . 03 On the first day of the feast the Jews
celebrated the Paschal meal (Seder); each father acted as leader of the
service for his gathered family, performed with them a ritual recalling
those bitter Mosaic days, and passed on, by questions and answers, their
treasured story to the young. At Pentecost, seven weeks after Passover,
the feast of Shavuot celebrated the wheat harvest, and the revela- tion
on Mt. Sinai. On the first day of Tishri-the seventh month of the
ec-</p>
<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>clesiastical, the first month of the Jewish civil year, corresponding
roughly with the autumnal equinox — the Jews celebrated Rosh-ha-Shana,
the Feast of the New Year and of the month’s new moon, and blew the
ram’s horn (shofar) to commemorate the revealing of the Torah, to call
men to repent- ance, and to anticipate the happy day when such a blast
would summon all the Jews of the world to worship their God in
Jerusalem. From the eve of Rosh-ha-Shana to the tenth day of Tishri were
penitential days; on all but the ninth of those days pious Jews fasted
and prayed; and on the tenth, Yom- ha-Kippurim, the Day of Atonement,
from sunset to sunset, they were not to eat of drink or wear shoes or
labor or bathe or indulge in love; all day long they attended services
in the synagogue, confessed and mourned their sins and those of their
people, even from the worship of the Golden Calf. On the fifteenth day
of Tishri came Sukkoth, the Feast of Tabernacles; for seven days the
Jews were supposed to live in booths, to commemorate the tents in which,
it was said, their ancestors had slept during th eir forty years’
sojourn in the wilderness. In the Dispersion a literal fulfillment of
this old vintage or harvest festival offered difficulties, and the
rabbis showed their good will by redefining sukka to mean almost
anything that could symbolize a habitation. On the twenty-fifth of the
ninth month, Kislev (December), and for seven days thereafter, the
festival of Hanukkah, or Dedication, recalled the purifi- cation of the
Temple by the Maccabees (165 b.c.) after its defilement by Antiochus
Epiphanes. And on the fourteenth of Adar (March) the Jews celebrated
Purim (“lots”), the deliverance of their people from the wiles of the
Persian minister Haman by Esther and Mordecai. Gifts and good wishes
were exchanged in a joyful and vinous feast; on that day, said Rab Raba,
a man should drink until he could no longer distinguish between “Cursed
be Haman!” and “Cursed be Mordecai!” 84</p>
<p>We must not think of those Talmudic Jews as dour pessimists, sick
with the pangs of despised talents, tossed about by the storms of
doctrine, and lost in longing for their ravished fatherland. Amid
dispersion and oppression, atonement and poverty, they kept their heads
erect, relished the tang and strife of life, the brief beauty of their
burdened women, and the abiding splendor of earth and sky. “Every day,”
said Rabbi Meir, “a man should utter a hundred benedictions.” 05 And
another said, for all of us: “To walk even four ells without bowing the
head is an offense to Heaven; for is it not written, ‘The whole earth is
full of His glory’?” 00</p>
<p>3 . Ethics of the Talmud</p>
<p>The Talmud is not only an encyclopedia of Jewish history,
theology,</p>
<p>ritual, medicine, and folklore; it is also a treatise on agriculture,
gardens, in- dustry, the professions, commerce, 87 finance, taxation,
property, slavery, in-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>heritance, theft, legal procedure, and penal law. To do the book
justice it would be necessary with polymathic wisdom to survey its
judgments in all these fields.</p>
<p>The Talmud is above all a code of ethics, so different from the
Christian, and so like the Moslem, that even a running acquaintance with
it challenges the view of the Middle Ages as merely the story of
medieval Christianity. The three religions agreed in rejecting the
practicability of a natural — non- religious — morality; most men, they
believed, can be persuaded to tolerable behavior only by the fear of
God. All three based their moral code on iden- tical conceptions: the
all-seeing eye and all-recording hand of God, the di- vine authorship of
the moral code, and the ultimate equalization of virtue with happiness
by post-mortem punishments and rewards. In the two Semitic cultures law,
as well as ethics, was inseparable from religion; no distinction was
admitted between crime and sin, between civil and ecclesiastical law;
every discreditable act is an offense against God, a profanation of His
pres- ence and Holy Name.</p>
<p>The three religions agreed further on certain elements of morality:
the sanctity of the family and the home, the honor due to parents and
the old, the loving care of children, and charity to all. No people has
surpassed the Jews in the order of beauty of family life. In Judaism, as
in Islam, voluntary celibacy or childlessness was a major sin; 08 to
make a home and a family was a religious mandate, 09 the first of the
613 precepts of the Law; “a childless person,” says a midrash, 70 “is
accounted as dead.” Jew, Christian, and Moslem agreed that the adequate
continuance of the group is endangered when the religious command to
parentage loses its force. Under certain circumstances, however, the
rabbis permitted family limitation, preferably by contracep- tion.
“There are three classes of women who should employ an absorbent: a
minor, lest pregnancy should prove fatal; a pregnant woman, lest
abortion should result; and a nursing mother, lest she become pregnant
and prema- turely wean the child so that it dies.” 71</p>
<p>The Jews, like their contemporaries, were reluctant to have
daughters, but rejoiced at the birth of a son; he, not she, could carry
on the father’s name, family, and property, and tend his grave; the
daughter would marry into an- other, perhaps a distant, household, and
be lost to her parents as soon as her rearing was complete. But once
children came, they were cherished without favoritism, and with a wise
mixture of discipline and love. “If thou must strike a child,” said one
rabbi, “do it with a shoestring”; 72 “if one refrains from punishing a
child,” says another, “it will end by becoming utterly de - praved.” 73
Every sacrifice must be made to give the child an education— i.e., to
instruct the mind and train the character by a knowledge of “the Law and
the Prophets.” “The world is saved,” said a Hebrew proverb, “ by the
breath of school children”; 74 the Shekinah, or divine presence, shines
in their faces.</p>
<p>CHAP. XV) THE TALMUD 361</p>
<p>The child in turn must honor and protect the parents, under all
conditions, to the end.</p>
<p>Charity was an inescapable obligation. “Greater is he who practices
char - ity than” he who performs “all the sacrifices.” 75 Some Jews were
nig - gardly, some were miserly, but by and large no other people has
ever given as generously as the Jews. The rabbis had to forbid men to
give more than a fifth of their property to charity; yet some were
found, at their death, to have given half. 76 “On Abba Umna’s face there
was always a holy peace. He was a surgeon, but would never accept with
his hands any payment for his service. He had a box placed in a comer of
his consulting room, so that those who were able to pay could deposit
what they wished . . . and those who could not afford to pay would not
be shamed.” 77 Rab Huna, “when he sat down to a meal, would open the
doors and exclaim, ‘Let whoever is in need enter and eat.’” 78 Chama ben
Ilai gave bread to all who sought it, and kept his hand in his purse
when he walked abroad, so that none need hesitate to ask. 79 But the
Talmud reproved conspicous giving, and counseled a modest secre cy: “He
who dispenses charity in private is greater than Moses.” 80</p>
<p>To the institution of marriage the rabbis addressed all their
learning and eloquence; on it and religion rested the whole structure of
Jewish life. They did not condemn the sexual appetite, but they feared
its force, and labored to control it. Some advised that salt be eaten
with bread “to lessen the seminal fluid”; 81 others felt that the only
recourse against sexual temptation was hard</p>
<p>was once sellin g ladies’ baskets when he was exposed to
temptation.</p>
<p>He pleaded with his tempter to let him off, and promised to
return.</p>
<p>But instead of returning he went up to the roof of a house and threw
himself down. Before he reached the ground Elijah came and caught him,
and reproached him with having brought him a distance of 400 miles to
save him from self-destruction. 84</p>
<p>The rabbis apparently felt that virginity is all right in its place,
but that perpetual virginity is arrested development; in their view the
supreme per- fection of a woman is perfect motherhood, as the supreme
virtue of man is perfect fatherhood. Every father was urged to save and
provide a dowry for each of his daughters, and a marriage settlement for
each son, lest their mar-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>riage be unhealthily delayed. Early marriage was recommended — at
fourteen for the girl, eighteen for the man. A girl might legally marry
at twelve years and six months, a man at thirteen. Postponement of
marriage was permitted to students engaged in the study of the Law. Some
rabbis argued that a man should get his economic footing before marrying
— “A man should first build a house, then plant a vineyard, then marry”
85 — but this was a minority opin- ion, and perhaps involved no
contradiction if the parents provided the ex- pected financial aid. The
youth was advised to choose his mate not for her beauty but for her
prospective qualities as a mother . 80 “Descend a step in choosing a
wife, ascend a step in choos ing a friend”; 87 to marry a woman above
one’s rank is to invite contumely.</p>
<p>The Talmud, like the Old Testament and the Koran, allowed polygamy.
“A man may marry as many wives as he pleases,” said one rabbi; but
another</p>
<p>Divorce by mutual consent was allowed. The husband could be divorced
only with his consent; the wife without her consent. To divorce an adul-
terous wife was mandatory, and divorce was recommended where the wife
had remained childless ten years after marriage . 92 The school of
Shammai had allowed the husband to put away his wife only for adultery;
the school of Hille l allowed it if the husband found in her “anything
.unseemly.” Hillel’s view prevailed in the Talmudic period; and Akiba
went so far as to say that a husband “may divorce his wife if he finds
another woman more beauti - ful.” 93 A man might, without surr endering
the marriage settlement, divorce “a woman who transgresses Jewish law,
such as going in public with uncov - ered head, spinning in the street,
or conversing with all sorts of men”; or “a loud-voiced woman — i.e.,
one who talks in her house and her neighbors can hear what she says.” 94
Desertion by the husband gave no ground for di - vorce . 95 Some rabbis
permitted the wife to ask the court for divorce from a cruel, impotent,
or unwilling husband, or one who did not support her prop- erly , 90 or
was maimed, or stank . 97 The rabbis did something to discourage divorce
by requiring complex legal formalities, and, in all but a few cases,
the</p>
<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>3&lt;53</p>
<p>forfeiture of both dowry and marriage settlement to the wife. “The
very altar sheds tears,” said Rabbi Eleazar, “on him who divorces the
wife of his youth.” 98</p>
<p>All in all, Talmudic law, like the Mohammedan, was man-made law, and
favored the male so strongly as to suggest, in the rabbis, a very terror
of woman’s powe r. Like the Christian Fathers, they blamed her for
extinguish- ing the “Soul of the World” through Eve’s intelligent
curiosity. They con - sidered woman “light - minded,” 99 and yet
admitted in her an instinctive wisdom missing in man . 100 They deplored
the loquacity of women at great length (“Ten measures of speech
descended to the world; women took nine, men one” 101 ) ; they condemned
their addiction to the occult , 102 to rouge and kohl . 103 They
approved of a man spending generously on his wife’s raiment, but wished
she would beautify herself for her husband rather than for other men .
104 In law, according to one rabbi, “a hundred women are equal to only
one witness.” 105 Their property rights were as limited in the Talmud as
in eighteenth-century England; their earnings, and the income from any
prop- erty they might own, belonged to their husbands . 100 Woman’s
place was in the home. In the utopian “Days of the Messiah,” said a
hopeful rabbi, woman “will bear a child every day.” 107 “A man who has a
bad wife will never see the face of hell.” 108 On the other hand no man
is so rich, said Akiba, as one who has a wife noted for her good deeds .
109 “Everything derives from the woman,” says a midrash . 110 According
to Hebrew proverbs: “All t he bless- ings of a household come through
the wife; therefore should her husband</p>
<p>honor her Let men beware of causing women to weep; God counts
their</p>
<p>tears.” 111</p>
<p>In the most delightful part of the Talmud, the little treatise Pirke
Aboth, an unknown editor gathered the maxims of the great rabbis of the
last two centuries before, and the first two centuries after, Christ.
Many of these apothegms praise wisdom, and some define it.</p>

<li>LIFE AND THE LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>The Talmud is not a work of art. The task of reducing the thought of
a thousand years into a coherent system proved too much even for a
hundred patient rabbis. Several tractates are obviously in the wrong
seder or order; several chapters are in the wrong tractate; subjects are
taken up, dropped, and lawlessly resumed. It is not the product of
deliberation, it is the delibera- tion itself; all views are recorded,
and contradictions are often left unre- solved; it is as if we had
crossed fifteen centuries to eavesdrop on the most intimate discussions
of the schools, and heard Akiba and Meir and Jehuda Hanasi and Rab in
the heat of their debates. Remembering that we are inter- lopers, that
these men and the others have had their casual words snatched from their
mouths and cast into uncalculated contexts and sent hurtling down the
years, we can forgive the casuistry, sophistry, legends, astrology,
demonology, superstition, magic, miracles, numerology, and revelatory
dreams, the Pelion on Ossa of argument crowning a web of fantasy, the
con- solatory vanity forever healing frustrated hope.</p>
<p>If we resent the stringency of these laws, the intrusive minuteness
of these regulations, the Oriental severity of punishment for their
violation, we must not take the matter too much to heart; the Jews made
no pretense to keeping all these commandments, and the rabbis winked on
every other page at the gap between their counsels of perfection and the
stealthy frailties of men. “If Israel should properly obser ve a single
Sabbath,” said a cautious rabbi, “the Son of David would come
immediately.” 116 The Talmud was not a code of laws requiring strict
obedience; it was a record of rabbinical opinion, gath- ered for the
guidance of leisurely piety. The untutored masses obeyed only a choice
few of the precepts of the Law.</p>
<p>There was in the Talmud a strong emphasis on ritual; but that was in
part the Jew’s reaction to the attempts of Church and state to make him
abandon his Law; the ritual was a mark of identity, a bond of unity and
continuity, a badge of defiance to a never-forgiving world. Here and
there, in these twenty volumes, we find words of hatred for
Christianity; but they were for a Christianity that had forgotten the
gentleness of Christ; that persecuted the adherents of the Law that
Christ had bidden His followers to fulfill; and that had, in the view of
the rabbis, abandoned the monotheism which was the in- alienable essence
of the ancient faith. Amid these ceremonial complexities and
controversial barbs we find hundreds of sage counsels and psychological
insights, and occasional passages recalling the majesty of the Old
Testament or the mystical tenderness of the New. The whimsical humor

<p>THE TALMUD</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>of the Jew lightens the burden of the long lesson. So one rabbi tells
how Moses entered incognito into Akiba’s classroom, sat in the last row,
and mar - veled at the many laws derived by the great teacher from the
Mosaic code, and of which its amanuensis had never dreamed. 117</p>
<p>For 1400 years the Talmud was the core of Jewish education. Seven
hours a day, through seven years, the Hebrew youth pored over it,
recited it, sank it into his memory by sound and sight; and like the
Confucian classics simi- larly memorized, it formed mind and character
by the discipline of its study and the deposit of its lore. The method
of teaching was not by mere recita- tion and repetition; it was also by
disputation between master and pupil, be- tween pupil and pupil, and the
application of old laws to the circumstances of the new day. The result
was a sharpness of intellect, a retentiveness of memory, that gave the
Jew an advantage in many spheres requiring clarity, concentration,
persistence, and exactitude, while at the same time it tended to narrow
the range and freedom of the Jewish mind. The Talmud tamed the excitable
nature of the Jew; it checked his individualism, and molded him to
fidelity and sobriety in his family and his community. Superior minds
may h ave been hampered by the “yoke of the Law,” but the Jews as a
whole were</p>
<p>The Talmud can never be understood except in terms of history, as an
or- gan of survival for a people exiled, destitute, oppressed, and in
danger of utter disintegration. What the Prophets had done to uphold the
Jewish spirit in the Babylonian Captivity, the rabbis did in this wider
dispersion. Pride had to be regained, order had to be established, faith
and morals maintained, health of body and mind rebuilt after a
shattering experience. 118 Through this heroic discipline, this
rerooting of the uprooted Jew in his own tradition — stability and unity
were restored through continents of wandering and centuries of grief.
The Talmud, as Heine said, was a portable Fatherland; wherever Jews
were, even as fearful enclaves in alien lands, they could put themselves
again into their own world, and live with their Prophets and rabbis, by
bathing their minds and hearts in the ocean of the Law. No wonder they
loved this book, to us more undulant and diverse than a hundred
Montaignes. They preserved even fragments of it with fierce affection,
took their turns in read- ing snatches of the enormous manuscript, paid
great sums, in later centuries, to have it printed in all its fullness,
wept when kings and popes and parlia- ments banned or confiscated or
burned it, rejoiced to hear Reuchlin and Erasmus defend it, and made it,
even to our own time, the most precious pos- session of their temples
and their homes, the refuge, solace, and prison of the Jewish soul.</p>
