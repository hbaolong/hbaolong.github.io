<h4 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h4>
<p>Religion and Philosophy</p>
<p>I. THE RELIGIOUS SITUATION</p>
<p>T HE story of the eighteenth century in Western Europe had a double
theme: the collapse of the old feudal regime, and the near-collapse of
the Christian religion that had given it spiritual and social support.
State and faith were bound together in mutual aid, and the fall of one
seemed to in- volve the other in a common tragedy.</p>
<p>In both aspects of the great change England played the first act. On
the political stage her Civil War of 1642-49 preceded by 147 years the
French Revolution in deposing a feudal aristocracy and beheading a king.
In the religious realm the deistic criticism of Christianity antedated
by half a cen- tury the Voltairean campaign in France; the materialism
of Hobbes pre- ceded by a century the materialism of La Mettrie; Hume’s
Treatise of Human Nature (1739) and his essay “Of Miracles” (1748)
antedated the attack of the French philosophes upon Christianity in the
Encyclopedic (1751). Voltaire had learned his skepticism in France —
partly from the English exile Bolingbroke — before coming to England;
but his three years in England (1726-28) startled him with the sight of
orthodoxy in decay, Catholicism humiliated, Protestantism breaking up
into feeble sects, and deists challenging everything in Christianity
except the belief in God — precisely the challenge that Voltaire would
carry to France. “In France,” said Voltaire, “I am looked upon as having
too little religion; in England as having too much.” 1</p>
<p>Montesquieu, visiting England in 1731, reported, “There is no
religion in England.” 2 This was, of course, an exercise in striking
hyperbole; at that very time John and Charles Wesley were founding the
Methodist move- ment at Oxford. But Montesquieu, an aristocrat, moved
mostly among lords and ladies of the peerage or the pen; and in these
groups, he tells us, “if re - ligion is spoken of, everybody lau ghs.” 3
This too seems extreme; but hear Lord Hervey, who knew almost every man,
woman, and deviate in the upper classes:</p>
<p>This fable of Christianity . . . was now 〔1728〕 so exploded in
Eng-</p>
<p>land that any man of fashion or condition would have been almost</p>
<p>as much ashamed to own himself a Christian as formerly he would</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>I 17</p>
<p>have been to profess himself none. Even the women who prided them-
selves at all on their understanding took care to let people know that
Christian prejudices were what they despised being bound by. 4</p>
<p>In those exalted ranks or minds religion meant either the somnolence
of the Anglican communion or the “enthusiasm” of the Dissenting sects;
and Dr. Johnson would soon define enthusiasm as “a vain belief of
private rev - elation”— literally a “god within.” The Established Church
had lost face and influence by supporting the Stuarts against the
Hanoverians and the trium- phant Whigs; now it submitted to the state,
and its clergy became humble dependents of the ruling class. The country
parson was the favorite butt of literary satire or vulgar ridicule;
Fielding honored the exceptions in Parson Adams. Class distinctions
prevailed in the churches; the rich had special pews near the pulpit,
the tradesmen sat behind them, the common people sat or stood in the
rear; and when the service was over, the com- moners remained in their
places while their superiors filed out in slow dig- nity. 5 In some
London churches, when too many of the poor came to wor- ship, the
periwigged members fled, locking their pews behind them, 6 and seeking
fresher air.</p>
<p>Some Anglican bishops, like Butler, Berkeley, and Warburton, were men
of great learning, and two of these were of fine character; but most of
the upper clergy, maneuvering for promotion, played politics with the
skeptics and mistresses of the court, and consumed in luxury the
revenues of many parishes. Bishop Chandler, we are told, paid £ 9,000
for advancement from Lichfield to Durham; Bishop Willis of Winchester,
Archbishop Potter of Canterbury, Bishops Gibson and Sherlock of London
died “shamefully rich,” some of them worth £ ioo,ooo. 7 Thackeray had no
stomach for them:</p>
<p>I read that Lady Yarmouth 〔mistress of George II〕 sold a
bishopric</p>
<p>to a clergyman for £ 5,000. . . . Was he the only prelate of his
time</p>
<p>led up by such hands for consecration? As I peep into George II’s
St. James’s, I see crowds of cassocks rust ling up the back stairs of
the</p>
<p>ladies of the court; stealthy clergy slipping purses into their laps;
that godless old King yawning under his canopy in his Chapel Royal as
the chaplain before him is discoursing, 〔or〕 chattering in German …
so</p>
<p>loud that the clergyman . . . burst out crying in his pulpit
because</p>
<p>the defender of the faith and dispenser of bishoprics would not
listen to him! 8</p>
<p>It was a sign of the times that the Established Church had become
broadly tolerant of different theologies and rituals among its members.
Pitt described it as “a Calvinist creed, a Popish liturgy, and an
Arminian clergy” 9 — i.e., the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Il8</p>
<p>official doctrine was predestinarian, the ritual was semi-Roman
Catholic, but a Latitudinarian spirit allowed Anglican ministers to
reject Calvin’s determinism and adopt the free-will teaching of the
Dutch heretic Arminius. Toleration grew because faith declined. Heresies
like Hume’s, which would have startled seventeenth-century England, made
now but a slight ripple on the stream of British thought. Hume himself
described England as “set - tled into the most cool indifference with
regard to religious matters that is to be found in any nation in the
world.” 10</p>
<p>The letter of the law made the Anglican worship compulsory on all</p>
<p>Englishmen. A man who absented himself from Sunday services was
liable to a fine of a shilling for each truancy; and anyone who allowed
such an absentee to live with him was subject to a fine of twenty pounds
per month; 11 these laws, however, were seldom enforced. Again in law
rather than practice, Catholic services were outlawed. A Catholic priest
who per- formed any sacerdotal function was subject to life
imprisonment. A like penalty discouraged any Catholic from keeping a
school; and no parent might send his child abroad for a Catholic
education, under penalty of £ ioo fine. Only those citizens who took the
oaths of allegiance and su- premacy (acknowledging the king of England
to be head of the Church), and declared against transubstantiation, were
eligible to buy or inherit land. Any Catholic who refused to take these
oaths was excluded from civil or military office, from the practice of
law, from bringing any action at law, and from living within ten miles
of London; moreover, such a Catholic might at any time be banished from
England, and be sentenced to death if he returned. Actually, however,
under Georges I and II, Catholics regularly transmitted their property
and their creed to their children; they could hear Mass unhindered in
their chapels and homes; and many of them took the required oaths with a
mental reservation. 12</p>
<p>Nearly all ardent English Protestants were now in the sects
dissenting from the Established Church. Voltaire laughed and rejoiced at
their multi- plicity: Independents (Puritans), Presbyterians, Baptists,
Congregational- ists, Quakers, Socinians (Unitarians) . The
Presbyterians, having lost politi- cal power, were becoming tolerant;
they did not take predestination very seriously, and many of them were
quietly content with a human Christ. 13 In 1719 an assembly of
Presbyterian clergymen voted 73 to 69 that subscrip- tion to the
orthodox doctrine of the Trinity should no longer be required of
candidates for the ministry. 14 The Quakers were increasing not in num-
ber but in wealth; and as they rose in the social scale they became more
reconciled to the ways and sins of men. A tendency to gloom infected
nearly all Dissenters, even in prosperity; and while the upper classes
made Sunday a day of frolic, the lower middle class — where Dissent was
strongest —continued the “blue Sunday” of the Puritans. There, after
morning</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>prayers at home, the family went to the meetinghouse for a service
that lasted two hours; back at home, the father read the Bible or pious
books to his wife and children, who, as like as not, sat on cushions on
the uncarpeted floor. Normally they went to services again in the
afternoon and evening, prayed together, heard another sermon, and found
some pleasure in singing sonorous hymns. No profane singing was allowed
on that holy day, no card- playing, in general no amusement of any kind.
Travel was to be avoided on the Sabbath, so allowing the highwaymen a
day of rest.</p>
<p>Voltaire, reviewing the religious scene of England, found much in it
to carry a lesson to a France where intolerance still ruled:</p>
<p>Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London. . . . There the Jew,</p>
<p>the Mohammedan, and the Christian transact business together as</p>
<p>though they were all of the same religion, and give the name of
Infidels to none but bankrupts; there the Presbyterian confides in the
Anabap- tist, and the Churchman depe nds upon the Quaker’s word. At
the</p>
<p>breaking up of this . . . free assembly some withdraw to the
syna-</p>
<p>gogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptized in a
great tub in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that man</p>
<p>has his son’s foreskin cut off, and causes a set of Hebrew words — to
the meaning of which he himself is a total stranger — to be mumbled over
the infant; others 〔Quakers〕 retire to their churches, and there wait
the inspiration of heaven with their hats on; and all are satisfied.</p>
<p>If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would
very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people</p>
<p>would cut one another’s throats; but as there is such a multitude,
they all live happy and in peace . 15</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DEISTIC CHALLENGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Many factors worked together to undermine the Christian creed in Eng-
land: the association of the Church with the rise and fall of political
parties, the growth of wealth and the demands of pleasure in the upper
classes, the internationalism of ideas through commerce and travel, the
increasing ac- quaintance with non-Christian religions and peoples, the
multiplication and mutual criticism of sects, the development of
science, the growth of belief in natural causes and invariable laws, the
historical and critical study of the Bible, the importation or
translation of such epochal books as Bayle’s Dic - tionnaire and
Spinoza’s Tractatus theologico -politicus, the abandonment (1694) of
state censorship of the press, the rising prestige of reason, the new
attempts of philosophy, in Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke, to give natural ex-
planations of the world and man, and — summing up many of these factors
—</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>the campaign of the deists to reduce Christianity to a belief in God
and immortality.</p>
<p>That movement had begun with Lord Herbert of Cherbury’s De
Veritate</p>
<p>a jolly young woman met him and accosted him in the following man-
ner: . . . “You old rogue, are you not hanged yet?” To which Mr.</p>
<p>Woolston answered: “Good woman, I know you not; pray, what have I
done to offend you?” To which the woman replied: “You have writ</p>
<p>against my Saviour; w’hat would become of my poor sinful soul if
it</p>
<p>was not for my dear Saviour? — my Saviour who died for such wicked
sinners as I am .” 19</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>1 2 I</p>
<p>The deistic propaganda reached its climax in Matthew Tindal, a fellow
of All Souls’ College, Oxford. After a quiet and respectable life,
marked chiefly by conversions to and from Catholicism, he published at
the age of seventy- three the first volume of Christianity as Old as the
Creation (1730). At his death three years later he left the manuscript
of a second volume, which fell into the hands of a bishop, who destroyed
it. We may estimate the impact of Volume I from the 1 50 replies that
sought to counter it; it was this book that called forth Bishop Butler’s
Analogy of Religion and Bishop Berkeley’s Alciphron.</p>
<p>Tindal ranged with no tender mercy through all the fantasies of
theology. He asked why God should have given his revelation to one small
people, the Jews, had let it remain their exclusive possession for four
thousand years, and then had sent his son to them with another
revelation that after seven- teen hundred years was still confined to a
minority of the human race. What sort of god could this be who used such
clumsy methods with such tardy and inadequate results? What ogre of a
god was this who punished Adam and Eve for seeking knowledge, and then
punished all their posterity merely for being born? We are told that the
absurdities in the Bible are due to God’s adapting his speech to the
language and ideas of his hearers. What nonsense! Why could he not speak
the simple truth to them intelligibly? Why should he have used priests
as his intermediaries instead of speaking directly to every man’s soul?
Why should he have allowed his specially revealed religion to become an
engine of persecution, terror, and strife, leaving men no better
morally, after centuries of this dispensation, than be- fore? — making
them, indeed, more fierce and cruel than under the pagan cults! Is there
not a finer morality in Confucius or Cicero than in the Chris- tianity
of history? The real revelation is in Nature herself, and in man’s
God-given reason; the real God is the God that Newton revealed, the de-
signer of a marvelous world operating majestically according to
invariable law; and the real morality is the life of reason in harmony
with nature. “Whoever so regulates his natural appetites as will conduce
most to the exercise of his reason, the health of his body, and the
pleasures of his senses taken and considered together (since herein his
happiness consists) may be certain he can never offend his Maker, who,
as he governs all things ac- cording to their natures can’t but expect
his rational creatures should act according to their natures.” 20 This i
s the true morality, this is the true Christianity, “as old as the
creation.”</p>
<p>Conyers Middleton carried on the attack from the historical angle.
Grad- uating from Trinity College, Cambridge, he took holy orders, and,
while dealing blow after blow at orthodox belief, continued the external
practices of Christian worship. He wrote some of the best prose of his
time, and his</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Life of Cicero (1741), though it borrowed heavily from its
predecessors, remains to this day an admirable biography. He pleased his
fellow clergy- men when he sent to England Letters from Rome (1729),
showing in schol- arly detail the residue of pagan rites in Catholic
ritual — incense, holy water, relics, miracles, votive offerings and
lights set up before sacred shrines, and the Pontifex Maximus of
antiquity become the Supreme Pontiff of Rome. Protestant England
applauded, but it soon discovered that Middleton’s pen - chant for
history could trouble Protestant as well as Catholic theology. When
Daniel Waterland defended, against Tindal, the literal truth and
inspiration of the Bible, Middleton in a Letter to Dr. Waterland (1731)
warned the Protestant divines that to insist on all the legends of the
Bible as actual history was suicidal; sooner or later the progress of
knowledge would discredit such fables and compel Christian apologists to
retreat shamefacedly to some more modest stand. Then Middleton resorted
to an argument that betrayed the effect which his study of history had
had upon his religious faith: even if Christian theology is incredible,
a good citizen will support Christianity and the Christian Church as a
bulwark of social order, provid- ing admirable deterrents to the
barbarism latent in mankind. 21</p>
<p>Finally, Middleton issued his most substantial work, A Free Inquiry
into the Miraculous Powers Which Are Supposed to Have Existed in the
Chris- tian Church through Successive Ages (1748) — a book that Hume
later ranked as superior to his own contemporary essay “Of Miracles”
(1748). He began by acknowledging the authority of the miracles ascribed
in the canonical New Testament to Christ or his apostles; he proposed to
show only that the miracles attributed to the Fathers, saints, and
martyrs of the Church, after the first Christian century, were
undeserving of belief; merely to relate those stories sufficed to reveal
their absurdity. Some Fathers of the Church had sanctioned such tales
while knowing them to be false; and Middleton quoted Mosheim, the
learned ecclesiastical historian, as intimating his fear that “those who
search with any attention into the writings of the greatest and most
holy doctors of the fourth century will find them all, without
exception, disposed to deceive and to lie whenever the interest of
religion requires it.” 22</p>
<p>There were many defects in Middleton’s book. He forgot that he too
had recommended wholesale deception in support of Christianity, and he
ig- nored the possibility that some strange experiences, like the
exorcism of “diabolical possession,” or St. Anthony’s hearing the Devil
at his door, were</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>1^3</p>
<p>in contending that his arguments would weaken the whole supernatural
substructure of Christian belief. Perhaps Middleton had intended it so.
But he kept his ecclesiastical preferments to the end.</p>
<p>The conversion of Bolingbroke to deism was a secret and a contagion
in the aristocracy. In writings cautiously kept from publication during
his life he directed his scornful invective against almost all
philosophers except Bacon and Locke. He termed Plato the father of
theological mendacity, St. Paul a fanatical visionary, Leibniz a
“chimerical quack.” 23 He called meta - physicians “learned lunatics,”
and described as “pneumatical 〔windy〕 mad - men” all who thought soul
and body distinct. 24 He laughed at the Old Tes- tament as a farrago of
nonsense and lies. 25 He professed belief in God, but rejected the
remainder of the Christian creed. All knowledge is relative and
uncertain. “We ought always to be unbelieving. … In religion, govern -
ment, and philosophy we ought to distrust everything that is
established.” 26 He put behind him the last consolation of the skeptic —
the belief in progress; all societies go through cycles “from generation
to corruption, and from corruption to generation.” 27</p>
<p>In 1744 Bolingbroke inherited the family estate at Battersea, and
left France to spend there the concluding years of his struggle against
disease and despair. His former friends deserted him as his political
influence fell and his temper rose. The death of his second wife (1750)
ended his interest in human affairs; “I become every year more and more
isolated in this world” 28 — the nemesis of selfishness. In 1751 he was
seized with cancer</p>

<li>THE RELIGIOUS REBUTTAL</li>
</ol>
<p>The defenders of Christianity did not meet the deistic attack in any
spirit of resignation to defeat; on the contrary, they fought back with
as hearty a vigor, as extensive a learning, as virulent a style as
anything in Tindal, Middleton, or Bolingbroke. The weaker apologists,
like Bishop Chandler of Lichfield and Bishop Newton of London, relied on
trite arguments — that the Jews were fervently expecting a Messiah when
Christ came, and that many Jewish prophecies had been fulfilled by his
career; or, like Bishops Sherlock of London and Pearce of Rochester,
they appealed to the multiple ’ testimony for the resurrection of
Christ. Sherlock and others insisted that the evidence for the Christian
miracles was overwhelming, and sufficed to</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>uphold the divinity of Christ and Christianity. To reject a
well-attested event because it contradicts our experience, said
Sherlock, is a very risky procedure; on the same basis the inhabitants
of the tropics refused to believe in the reality of ice. When we assume
that things cannot be otherwise than we have known them to be, “we
outrun the information of our senses, and the conclusion stands on pr
ejudice, not on reason.” 30 Despite our wide but really narrow
experience, we cannot be sure that a man may not rise from the dead.
Consider how many marvels now accepted as routine events in our lives
were once held to be inconceivable!</p>
<p>George Berkeley, who had made his mark in philosophy in the years
1709-13, sent from Rhode Island his contribution to the debate in Alci-
phron, or The Minute Philosopher (1733), a dialogue sparkling with bold
thought and sprightly style. Alciphron describes himself as a
freethinker who has progressed from Latitudinarianism to deism to
atheism; now he re- jects all religion as a deception practiced upon the
people by priests and magistrates; he refuses to believe in anything but
the senses, the passions, and the appetites. Euphranor, voicing
Berkeley, warns the deists that their doctrine leads to atheism, and
that atheism will lead to the collapse of moral- ity. There may be a few
good atheists, but will not their doctrine, if ac- cepted by the masses,
issue in libertinism and lawlessness? These skeptics of religion should
be skeptics of science too, for many statements of scientists — as in
higher mathematics — are quite beyond the evidence of our senses or the
reach of our understanding. Certainly the doctrine of the Trinity is no
more incomprehensible than the square root of minus one.</p>
<p>William Warburton was not the man to rest his faith or his
ecclesiastical revenues upon so frail a base as Berkeley’s s urds.
Trained as a lawyer, or- dained an Anglican priest, he fought his way
through the theological jungle with all the alert resourcefulness of the
legal mind. Perhaps he was fitter for the army than for either the bar
or the cloth; he relished battle, and could hardly sleep at night if he
had not slain some adversary during the day. He described his life as “a
warfare upon earth; that is to say, with bigots and libertines, against
whom I have denounced eternal war, like Hannibal against Rome, at th e
altar.” 31 His darts ranged far and wide, and when they ran out of foes
they slaughtered friends. He gave succinct descriptions of his con-
temporaries: Johnson, a malign and insolent bully; Garrick, whose
“sense, when he deviates into it, is more lik e nonsense”; Smollett, a
“vagabond Scot” who “writes nonsense ten thousand strong”; Voltaire, a
“scoundrel” wal - lowing in “the dirtiest sink of freethinking.” 32</p>
<p>His immense two-volume masterpiece appeared in 1737-41 as The Divine
Legation of Moses Demonstrated on the Principles of a Religious Deist.
Its argument was original and unique: The belief in a future state of
reward and punishment is (as many deists agreed) indispensable to social
order; but</p>

<p>Moses succeeded in organizing Jewish life to prosperity and morality
with- out that belief; this miracle can be explained only by the divine
guidance of Moses and the Jews; therefore the mission and laws of Moses
were divine, and the Bible is the word of God. Warburton felt that this
demonstration fell “very little short of mathematical certainty.” 33 His
theological col - leagues were not quite happy over his view that God
had guided the Jews through 6 1 3 laws and four thousand years without
letting them know that their souls were immortal. But the lusty author
had filled his pages with such learned disquisitions — on the nature of
morality, on the necessary alliance of Church and state, on the mystery
religions and rituals of antiquity, on the origin of writing, on the
meaning of hieroglyphics, on Egyptian chro- nology, on the date of the
Book of Job, and on the errors of freethinkers, antiquaries, scholars,
historians, Socinians, Turks, and Jews — that all Eng- land gasped at
the weight and reach of his erudition. Warburton advanced from battle to
battle — against Crousaz, Theobald, Bolingbroke, Middleton, Wesley, Hume
— to the lucrative and comfortable bishopric of Gloucester.</p>
<p>Joseph Butler was less tough of fiber but of finer grain: a man of
great gentleness, modesty, and benevolence, who suffered deeply from his
real- ization that the religion which had helped to wean European
civilization from barbarism was facing a trial for its life. He was
shocked by the popu- larity of Hobbesian materialism in the upper
classes. When (1747) he was offered the archbishopric of Canterbury —
the ecclesiastical primacy of Eng- land — he refused it on the ground
that “it was too late for him to try to support a falling Church.” 34 In
1751 he expressed his dismay at “the general decay of religion in this
nation. . . . The influence of it is more and more wearing out in the
minds of men. . . . The number of those who profess themselves
unbelievers increases, and with their numbers their zeal.” 35 As if he
felt that a people might suffer a spiritual amnesia through the abandon-
ment of its religious and moral heritage, he surprised his friend Dean
Tucker by asking might not a nation, as well as an individual, go
mad?</p>
<p>Nevertheless he gave his life to seeking an intellectual
rehabilitation of Christian belief. When lie was still a young priest of
thirty-four he pub- lished Fifteen Sermons (1726), in which he modified
Hobbes’s pessimistic analysis of human nature by claiming that man,
though in many ways natu- rally vicious, is also by nature a social and
moral being, with an inborn sense of right and wrong. Butler argued that
the nobler elements in the constitu- tion of man owe their origin to
God, whose voice they are; and on this basis he built a general theory
of divine design as permeating the world. Caroline liked the argument,
and in 1736 Butler was appointed “clerk of the closet” to the Queen.</p>
<p>In that year he issued what remained for a century the chief buttress
of Christian argument against unbelief — The Analogy of Religion,
Natural and</p>
<p>126 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature. The preface
revealed the mood of the time:</p>
<p>It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted by many per-</p>
<p>sons that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry but
that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious. And accordingly
they</p>
<p>treat it as if in the present age this were an agreed point among all
peo- ple of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a
principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were by way of reprisals
for its</p>
<p>having so long interrupted the pleasures of the world . 36</p>
<p>Intended as an answer to the deists, the Analogy assumed the
existence of God. The “natural religion” of the deists had accepted the
“God of Na - ture,” the great designer and artificer of the world, but
it had rejected, as quite incompatible with that lofty conception, the
apparently unjust God of the Bible. Butler proposed to show that there
are in nature as many signs of injustice and cruelty as in the Jehovah
of the Old Testament; that there is no contradiction between the God of
Nature and the God of Revelation; and that those who accepted the one
deity should logically accept the other. The good clerk of the closet
seems never to have dreamed that some hardy skeptics might conclude from
his argument (as James Mill did) that neither of these two gods deserved
to be worshiped by civilized men.</p>
<p>That both gods existed, and were one, Butler argued from probability.
Our minds are imperfect, and subject to every manner of error; we can
never have certainty, whether about God or about nature; it is enough to
have probability; and probability supports the beliefs in God and immor-
tality. The soul is clearly superior to the body, for the bodily organs
are the tools and servants of the soul. The soul, as obviously the
essence of man, need not perish with the body; probably, at death, it
seeks other instruments in a higher stage. Is it not conformable to
nature that an organism should be transformed from a lower to a finer
form — as creeping things become winged ones, as the chrysalis changes
into a butterfly? And another analogy makes it probable that in the life
of the soul after the death of the body there will be rewards and
punishments — always assuming the existence of God. For just as we
punish criminals for their offenses against society, so does nature, in
most cases, punish men for the evils they do; but since there are many
instances in which vice meets with no evident penalty, and virtue no
visible reward, in this life, it is incredible that God will not
restore, in an- other life, a juster relationship between conduct and
fate. Our conscience, or moral sense, could have come to us only from a
just God.</p>
<p>Butler’s arguments are now of interest chiefly as illustrating a
stage in the</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>12J</p>
<p>reason to reject the Bible because of the cruel God revealed in the
Old Testament, for the God of Nature is quite as cruel. It was a highly
original way to defend Christianity; Butler apparently did not suspect
that his argu- ment might lead not to Christianity but to something more
desperate than atheism — to Thomas Henry H uxley’s conclusion that the
ultimate forces in or behind the universe are unmoral, and run harshly
counter to that sense of right and wrong upon which Butler, like Kant,
based so much of his theology. In any case the Analogy marked an advance
if only in its good temper; here was no odium theologicum, no unctuous
vituperation, but an earnest attempt to be courteous even to those who
seemed to be destroying the most precious hopes of mankind. Queen
Caroline hailed the book as the best defense yet made of the Christian
creed. Dying, she recommended Butler for ecclesiastical advancement;
George II made him bishop of Bris- tol, then dean of St. Paul’s, finally
bishop of Durham. There Butler set an example to his peers by living
simply, and giving much of his income to the poor.</p>
<p>His Analogy left so many openings to unbelief that many churchmen
advised an end to debate, and preferred to rest their faith on religious
needs and sentiments beyond the shafts of reason. So Henry Dodwell’s
Christian - ity Not Founded on Argument (1742) rejected reasoning in
spiritual con- cerns; it is no guide to truth, much less to happiness,
but is merely an ener- vating dance of pros and cons; no man ever builds
his faith upon such fluid foundations. The arguments of Clarke,
Warburton, Butler, and other Chris- tian defenders, said Dodwell, had
shaken more religious belief than they had reinforced; there might have
been no atheism if the Boyle lecturers had not annually refuted it.
Christ did not argue; he taught as one having authority. Look at any
really religious person, and you will find an inner conviction, not an
intellectual conclusion. For the simple soul faith must be an accepted
tradition; for the mature spirit it must be a direct feeling of a
supernatural reality.</p>
<p>William Law, after making his mark in controversy with the deists,
was moved by reading Jakob Bohme to turn from argument to mysticism; and
in this half century of triumphant materialism and cynicism he wrote of
the inner presence and redeeming love of Christ as fervently and
confidently as if he had been Thomas a Kempis reborn and unchanged. He
sacrificed all worldly prospects by refusing to take the oath
acknowledging George I to be the head of the English Church; he was
deprived of his fellowship at Cambridge, and his degrees were revoked.
He became tutor to Edward Gibbon’s father, and remained with that family
long enough to be remem - bered by the historian. “In our family,” said
the skeptic, “he left the reputa - tion of a worthy and pious man who
believed all he professed, and practiced all that he enjoined.” 37
Johnson praised Law’s Serious Call to a Devout and</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Holy Life (1729) as “the finest piece of hortatory theology in any
lan - guage.” 38 Certainly its mysticism was healthier than that which
loses itself in supernatural visions, celestial or infernal. “There is
nothing that is super - natural,” Law wrote, “ in the whole system of
our redemption. Every part of it has its ground in the workings and
powers of nature, and all our re- demption is only nature set right.”
Hell is not a place, but the condition of the disordered soul; heaven is
not a place, it is “no foreign, separate, and im - posed state,” but the
happiness of a soul in order and at peace. 39 And though Law was a
faithful member of the Church of England, he dreamed of a regenerate and
Protestant monasticism:</p>
<p>If, therefore, persons of either sex, . . . desirous of
perfection,</p>
<p>should unite themselves into little societies, professing
voluntary</p>
<p>poverty, virginity, retirement, and devotion, that some might be re-
lieved by their charities, and all be blessed with their prayers and
bene- fited by their example; . . . such persons, … so far from being
charge- able with any superstition or blind devotion, . . . might justly
be said to restore that piety which was the boast and glory of the
Church</p>
<p>when its greatest saints were alive. 40</p>
<p>Law’s ideals and fine prose so moved Gibbon’s aunt Hester Gibbon that
she and a rich widow went to live near him in his native town of
Kingscliffe, Northamptonshire, and devoted most of their income to
charities under his supervision. He who had once been an eager scholar,
loving learned and polite company, now found his happiness in
distributing food, clothing, and homilies to the poor, the sick, and the
bereaved. He carried his austerity to a condemnation of nearly all
worldly pleasures; he renewed the Puritan campaign against the theater
as the “house of the Devil,” or at least “the</p>

<li>JOHN WESLEY: 1703-91</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand his place in history we must remind ourselves again
that when he and his brother Charles founded the Methodist movement at
Ox- ford (1729) religion in England was at lower ebb than at any time in
mod- ern history. Not more than five or six members of the House of
Commons went to church. 42 The Anglican clergy had so far accepted
rationalism as to base nearly all their writings on reasoning. They
seldom mentioned heaven or hell, and stressed social virtues rather than
otherworldliness. An English sermon, as described by Voltaire, was a
“solid but sometimes dry</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>dissertation which a man reads to the people without gesture and
without particular exaltation of the voice.” 43 Religion was active and
fervent only in the Dissenting sects of the middle class. The town
workers were almost wholly ignored by the Anglican clergy; “there was a
huge contingent, con - sisting of the lowest class, who were outside the
reach of education or of religion, who had no religion, and had never
been- taught any”; 44 they were abandoned to a poverty only dimly
lightened by religious’ hope. It was against this background that John
Wesley and George Whitefield effected a powerful revival of Puritan
beliefs and ethics, and established the Method- ist Church.</p>
<p>Wesley’s ancestry was shot through with theolo gy and rebellion. His
great-grandfather, Bartholomew Westley, was ejected from his rectories
in Dorset because he continued the Dissenting worship after the
restoration of the Anglican Church to ecclesiastical monopoly in
England. John’s</p>
<p>grandfather, John Westley, became a minister in Dorset, was
imprisoned for refusing to use the Book of Common Prayer, was ejected
from his rectory, and became a Dissenting pastor at Poole. John’s
father, Samuel Wesley, dropped the t from his name, worked his way
through Oxford, abandoned Dissent, was ordained an Anglican priest,
married Susanna Annesley (a preacher’s daughter), and became rector of
Epworth in Lincolnshire. Of his nineteen children eight died in infancy
— illustrating the labors of women, the careless virility of clergymen,
and the quality of medicine in eighteenth- century England. The father
was a stern disciplinarian at home and in the pulpit; he brought up his
children to fear a vengeful God, convicted one of his parishioners of
adultery, and compelled her to walk through the street in a garment of
repentance. 45 His wife rivaled him in strictness and piety. When her
most famous son was twenty-nine she explained to him her phi- losophy of
moral training:</p>
<p>I insist upon conquering the will of children betimes, because
this</p>
<p>is the only strong and rational foundation of a religious
education,</p>
<p>without which both precept and example will be ineffectual. But when
this is thoroughly done, then a child is capable of being governed by
the reason and piety of its parents, till its own understanding comes to
maturity. . . . When turned a year old they 〔her children〕 were</p>
<p>taught to fear the rod and cry softly; by which means they
escaped</p>
<p>abundance of correction they might otherwise have had. 46</p>
<p>The eldest of her sons, Samuel Wesley II, became a poet, a scholar,
and an Anglican priest who deprecated the Methodism of his brothers. The
eighteenth child was Charles Wesley, who powerfully seconded John’s
preaching with 6,500 hymns. John himself was the fifteenth, born at Ep-
worth in 1703. When he was six the rectory burned down; he was left
for</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>lost amid the flames, but he appeared at a second-story window, and
was rescued by a neighbor standing on the shoulders of another;
thereafter he called himself “a brand plucked from the burning,” and
never overcame his vivid fear of hell. In his father’s house any
unexplained noise was interpreted</p>
<p>At eleven John was sent to Charterhouse “public” school, and at seven
- teen to Christ Church, Oxford. He overcame his poor health by resolute
walking, riding, and swimming, and lived to be eighty-eight. He read
widely, and kept careful notes and abstracts of his reading. He
relished, above all other books, Jeremy Taylor’s Holy Living and Holy
Dying, and Thomas a Kempis’ Imitation of Christ. Even in his college
days he began— partly in cipher and shorthand — that Journal which is
one of the classics of English literature and Protestant piety. In 1726
he was made a fellow of Lincoln College; in 1728 he was ordained an
Anglican priest.</p>
<p>It was his brother Charles who first gathered at Oxford a little
group of some fifteen students and teachers resolved to practice
Christianity with methodical thoroughness. It was their enemies who in
derision gave them the names “Holy Club” and “Methodists.” They read
together the Greek Testament and the classics; they fasted every
Wednesday and Friday; they received the Lord’s Supper every week; they
visited prisoners and invalids to offei; them comfort and religious
hope; they accompanied condemned men to the scaffold. John Wesley came
to the leadership of the group through his greater enthusiasm and
devotion. He rose every day at four — a habit which he maintained into
extreme old age. He planned methodically, every morning, the tasks
allotted to each hour of the day. He lived on twenty-eight pounds a
year, and distributed the remainder of his income in charity. He fasted
so frequently that at one time he seemed to have ruined his health
beyond repair. He made pilgrimages on foot to William Law to solicit his
advice; Law’s Serio us Call to a Devout and Holy Life became his
spiritual guide; from this book, his Journal records, “the light flowed
in so mightily upon my soul that everything appeared in a new view.
47</p>
<p>In 1735 he and Charles were invited by General Oglethorpe to accom-
pany him as missionaries to Georgia. As their father had died, they con-
sulted their mother. “If I had twenty sons,” she told them, “I should
rejoice if they were all so employed, though I should never see them
more”; 48 how shall we divested ones understand this devotion? The Holy
Club adjourned sine die, and on October 14 John and Charles, with two
other “Methodists,” sailed on the Simmonds for Savannah. On board they
were impressed by the cheerful piety of some Moravian Brethren who had
left Germany to settle in America; when a severe storm buffeted the
little vessel the Moravians showed no fear; they rivaled the tempest
winds with their sturdy hymns; the Wesleys felt that this was a faith
stronger than their own.</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>H 1</p>
<p>Arrived in Georgia (February 5, 1736), the brothers took different
posts: Charles became secretary to Governor Oglethorpe, John became
pastor to the new community, and occasional missionary to the
neighboring Indians. At first he praised these as eager to receive the
Gospel, but two years later he described them as “gluttons, thieves,
dissemblers, liars, murderers of fathers, murderers of mothers,
murderers of their own children”; we are told that he “was not a success
with Indians.” 49 The white population, which in - cluded hundreds of
transported criminals, resented bis Oxford accent, his masterful spirit,
and his insistence on the strictest rules of ritual and disci- pline.
For baptism he required total and triple immersion, and when a parent
objected he refused to baptize the child. Still a “High Churchman of a
very narrow type,” 50 he repulsed from the Communion table a man of
respected</p>
<p>In London he renewed his austerities in the hope that they would
restore his confidence. But Peter Bohler, a Moravian preacher en route
to America, assured him that his faith was still inadequate; that no
matter how perfect his morals might be, or how zealous his piety and
ritual, he would remain in a state of damnation until, by a divine flash
of illumination and conviction quite distinct from any process of
reasoning, he should realize that Christ had died for him, and bad
expiated his sins; only after such conversion would a man be secure from
sinning, and certain of salvation. Wesley com- memorated in his Journal
the Magna Dies, or Great Day, May 24, 1738, when this final conversion
came to him:</p>
<p>In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate</p>
<p>Street, where one was reading Luther’s preface to the Epistle to
the</p>
<p>change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I
felt</p>
<p>my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ
alone,</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away
my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death. I</p>
<p>began to pray with all my might for those who had in a more especial
manner despitely used me and persecuted me. I then testified openly to
all there what I now first felt in my heart. 51</p>
<p>In brief, he had recapitulated the evolution of Christianity from
salvation by faith and works to salvation by faith alone (Luther) to
salvation by a personal and divine illumination (the Quakers). Grateful
to Bohler, Wesley crossed over to Germany in the summer of 1738, and
spent several weeks in Herrnhut, the Saxon village where a colony of
Moravian Brethren had been established on the estates of Count von
Zinzendorf.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Charles Wesley, on his return to England, had experienced a
similar conversion; in his more gentle way he had begun to preach to the
prisoners in Newgate, and from every pulpit to which he was admitted.
Still more important, a personality only less powerful than John Wesley
was coming to the fore in the Methodist movement. George Whitefield was
born to an innkeeper at Gloucester in 1714. For a year and more he
served as a drawer of liquor for his father’s guests. He worked his way
through Pembroke College, Oxford, and was one of the first members of
the Holy Club. He followed the Wesleys to Georgia in 1738, but returned
to Eng- land in the fall of that year to be ordained an Anglican priest.
Not satisfied with the opportunities given him in pulpits, and eager to
bring the inspira- tion of his faith to the masses of the people, he
began in February, 1739, to preach in the open fields near Bristol to
coal miners who had seldom dared or cared to enter a church. His voice
was so clear and strong that it could reach twenty thousand hearers, and
his fervent oratory so moved these hardened and weary men that he could
see (he tells us) “the white gutters made by their tears, which
plentifully fell down their black cheeks.” 52 The reputation of the new
preacher, and the reports of his open-air preaching, stirred the
imagination of England. Wherever Whitefield went, immense crowds
gathered to hear him.</p>
<p>His preaching was unforgettable. He made no pretense to erudition,
but he claimed to have talked intimately with God. 53 His language, said
Wesley, inclined to be “luscious and amorous,” using some startling
images; so he spoke of Christ being “roasted, as it were, in the
Father’s wrath, and there - fore fitly styled the Lamb of God.” 54
Whitefield in the field s, like Pitt in Parliament, brought the arts of
acting to his speech; he could weep at a moment’s notice and apparently
with sincere emotion; and he could make his simple auditors feel with
immediate intensity the sense of sin, the terror of hell, and the love
of Christ. Orators like Bolingbroke and Chesterfield, skeptics like
Franklin and Hume, actors like Garrick, admitted his power. Welcomed
everywhere, he made England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>America his parish. Thirteen times he crossed the Atlantic, twelve
times he traversed Scotland. It was not unusual for him to preach forty
hours in a week. By the age of fifty he was worn out. Too late he
reduced his program to “strict allowance”— that is, he preached only
once each weekday, and only three times on Sunday. In 1769 he made his
seventh visit to the colo- nies, and he died at Newburyport,
Massachusetts, in the following year.</p>
<p>John Wesley, returning from Herrnhut, could not quite approve of</p>
<p>Whitefield’s hortatory style, and hesitated to follow his example of
preach - ing under the sky. “Having been all my life (till very lately)
so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, … I should
have thought the saving of souls a lmost a sin if it had not been done
in a church.” 55 He overcame his distaste, and took his message to the
fields and streets; “I sub - mitted to be more vile 〔common〕 in the
highway” (April, 1739). His ora - tory was less passionate than
Whitefield’s, hi s language was that of a scholar and a gentleman, but
he too spoke to the emotions of his audiences. He made the daily lives
of simple folk seem to be part of a vast and noble drama in which their
souls were the battleground of Satan and Christ; they moved with him
into a world of portents and miracles; and they heard in him — as he
claimed to be — the voice of God. And whereas Whitefield preached and
then passed on, Wesley organized his followers into “little societies”
in one town after another, and guided them to permanence. Their meetings
re- called the agapes of the early Christians — feasts of religious joy
and com- munal love; they confessed their sins to one another, submitted
to scrutiny of their moral life, and joined in prayer and pious song.
John had already composed or translated some stirring hymns, and Charles
had begun his voluminous hymnology. In 1 740 Charles wrote the most
famous of his many beautiful hymns — “Jesus, Lover of My Soul.”</p>
<p>In these fervent groups John Wesley trained lay preachers who carried
on the new gospel when the leaders could not remain. Without ordination,
without any fixed parishes, with or without a pulpit, these “helpers”
spread</p>
<p>What did he preach? Essentially the Puritan creed that had seemed
mor- tally stricken by the moral riot of the Stuart Restoration. He
rejected (Whitefield accepted) predestination; following the Arminian
wing of the</p>
<p>J 34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Established Church, he insisted that man had enough freedom of will
to decide his own choice or refusal of divine grace. He repudiated all
appeals to reason; religion, he felt, went beyond the reach of man-made
logic, and depended upon divine inspiration and inward conviction; but
he turned away from mysticism on the ground that it left everything to
God and did not spur men to active goodness. He shared most of the
superstitions of his class and time: he believed in ghosts, in the
diabolical origin of strange noises, in the reality and criminality of
witchcraft; to give up belief in witchcraft, he argued, is to give up
belief in the Bible. He had no doubt about miracles; he thought they
were happening every day among his followers. A headache, a painful
tumor, a violent rupture, a broken leg were cured by his prayers or
those of the Methodist societies; and he told of a Catholic girl who
lost her sight whenever she read the Catholic Mass-book, but always
recovered it when she read the New Testament. He accepted the accounts
of women who claimed to have seen angels, Christ, heaven, or hell; and
he recorded in his Journal a number of cases where adversaries of
Methodism had been struck down by miraculous punishments. 56</p>
<p>His preaching was so vivid that many individuals in his audiences
were moved to hysteria and convulsions. The Journal tells of sinners
who, hearing him, were overcome with physical pain and rolled in agony
on the ground, while other believers knelt beside them and prayed for
their deliverance from Satanic possession. 57 Wesley describes a meeting
at Baldwin Street, London, in 1739:</p>
<p>My voice could scarce be heard amidst the groanings of some and</p>
<p>the cries of others. … A Quaker who stood by was not a little
dis-</p>
<p>pleased . . . when he himself dropped down as if thunderstruck. The
agony he was in was even terrible to behold. We besought God not to lay
folly to his charge, and he soon lifted up his head and cried aloud:
“Now I know that thou art a prophet of the Lord.” 58</p>
<p>An eyewitness quoted by Wesley describes a Methodist meeting at
Everton in 1759:</p>
<p>Some were shrieking, some roaring aloud. . . . The most general</p>
<p>was a loud breathing, like that of people half strangled and gasping
for life; and indeed almost all the cries were like those of human
creatures dying in bitter anguish. Great numbers wept without any noise;
others fell down as dead. … I stood upon the pew seat, as did a
young</p>
<p>man in the opposite pew, an able-bodied, fresh, healthy countryman;
but in a moment, when he seemed to think of nothing else, down</p>
<p>he dropt with a violence inconceivable. … I heard the stamping of</p>
<p>his feet ready to break the boards, as he lay in strong convulsions
at the bottom of the pew. . . . Almost all on whom God laid his hand</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>turned either very red or almost black. … A stranger,
well-dressed,</p>
<p>who stood facing me, fell backward to the wall, then forward on his
knees, wringing his hands and roaring like a bull. . . . He rose and</p>
<p>ran against the wall till Mr. Keeling and another held him. He
screamed out, “Oh, what shall I do. What shall I do? Oh, for one drop of
the</p>
<p>blood of Christ!” As he spoke God set his soul at liberty; he knew
his sins were blotted out, and the rapture he was in seemed too great
for human nature to bear . 59</p>
<p>Probably these hysterical outbreaks were caused by conditions
affecting the victims before the Methodist meeting, and the hellfire
sermon merely capped a climax beyond control. Wesley interpreted such
seizures as Satanic possessions followed by divine cures. Sometimes, he
thought, they brought no permanent good in conduct or character, but
often, he felt, they cleansed the soul of sin, and inaugurated a new
life.</p>
<p>The greatest success of Methodism was among the poor. The preachers
themselves were men of modest learning, simple in their sentiments and
speech; there was no barrier of class or culture between them and their
audience. They brought their message of sin and repentance to peasants,
miners, and criminals; and though they preached a faith that was based
on fear rather than love, they gave to the letterless an ethical code
that shared in the moral rehabilitation of England in the second half of
the eighteenth century. It was the Puritan ethic against which our own
time has moved into an extreme reaction. Wesley was hostile to almost
all amusement. He al- lowed cardplaying, but thought it a sin to go to
fairs, to wear jewelry or fine clothes, to attend a theater or to dance.
In the school that he founded at Kingswood no time was allotted for
play, for “he that plays when he is a child will play when he is a man
.” 60 But that Puritan ethic comported with the English character; it
could be borne by strong men and patient women; and it gave to the
working classes of England a proud sense of election and destiny that
upheld them in poverty and made them hostile to any revolu- tion that
questioned Christianity. Conservatives later felt grateful to Wesley
that he had saved the British poor from deism and free thought, and had
turned their aspirations from social revolt to individual salvation,
from an earthly utopia to a posthumous Paradise . 61</p>
<p>Wesley himself inclined to conservatism in politics. He was ahead of
his class in advocating some long- due reforms: he denounced the “rotten
bor - ough” system, the inequalities of representation in Parliament,
the corrosive corruption of English politics, the inhumanity of slavery,
the horrors of British jails. But he accepted the class structure of
society as natural and just; he opposed any relaxation of the laws
against Catholics, and in the re- volt of the American colonies his
sympathies were all with George III.</p>
<p>He remained an Anglican by creed, but he rejected the Anglican
view</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>that only a bishop in the Apostolic Succession could validly ordain a
priest; he himself ordained ministers for Scotland and America. When he
said “The world is my parish” 62 he proposed to preach wherever he
wished, without episcopal permission or allocation; to that extent he
seceded from the Estab- lished Church. But he exhorted his followers to
attend Anglican services, to shun Dissenting assemblies and creeds, and
to refrain from antagonizing the Anglican clergy. At first some Anglican
pulpits were opened to Method- ist ministers; but when Wesley’s lay
preachers assumed the right to ad - minister the Sacrament, and
Methodist doctrine reverted to the medieval emphasis on hell and the
Puritan preoccupation with sin, the Anglican di- vines withdrew their
support, as Erasmus had withdrawn from Luther; they preferred an orderly
development, and excluded the Methodists from Anglican pulpits.</p>
<p>Persecution of the new sect came far less from the Established Church
than from the simple commoners who could not tolerate new ways of
preaching old ideas. In town after town the open-air preachers — like
their later counterparts preaching a new social gospel — were assaulted
by mobs happy to be cruel without fear and without reproach. At Monmouth
a lay preacher was struck on the head by a rock, and died of the blow.
At Wednesbury a crowd wrecked the homes of Methodists, abused their
women, beat their men. When Wesley appeared it cried out for his blood,
and applauded those who cudgeled him; he prayed aloud, and it let him
go. At Bolton the house where he was preaching was invaded by an angry
as- semblage; amid a shower of stones, tiles, and eggs he continued his
sermon to the end. At Devizes a water engine was turned upon the
residence of Charles Wesley, and bulldogs were loosed upon his
followers. At Exeter Whitefield was stoned almost to death. At Hoxton an
ox was prodded into a Methodist congregation; at Pensford a bull,
maddened by baiting, was driven full against the table at which John
Wesley was preaching. The courage of the preachers appealed to the
British character, and gained them tolerance and support.</p>
<p>Wesley was a little man five feet three inches tall, weighing 128
pounds. He was impressive in old age by his white hair, but already in
middle age he arrested attention by his ascetic chiseled features and
dominating eyes. He took it for granted that he was made to govern; his
nervous energy and intellectual force put him naturally in the lead; his
unquestioning self-con- fidence sometimes carried him to an arrogance
that a Methodist bishop pro- nounced quite “overbearing.” 63 He was not
an easy man to get alo ng with, for he thought and moved too fast for
others to keep his pace. He married in 1751, having fallen in love, as
we all do, with the nurse who tended him in illness. For two years his
wife traveled with him on his hectic rounds; then her health and nerves
broke down and she left him, as one might leap from</p>

<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>*37</p>
<p>an unmanageable steed. He attributed his health and vitality to his
perpetual journeys on horseback or foot; perhaps we should add that
oratory is an aerating exercise. In 1735 he became a vegetarian; a year
later he and a friend decided to live on bread alone, to “try whether
life might not as well be sustained by one sort as by variety of food.
We . . . were never more vigorous and healthy than when we tasted
nothing else”; 64 but they soon relapsed into diversity.</p>
<p>What were the results of the Methodist preaching? In one generation
re- ligion, which had seemed to be dying under Anglican dignity and
deist doubts, became a vibrant element in English life, subordinate only
to politics and war. At Wesley’s death (1791) his followers numbered
79,000 in Eng - land, 40,000 in North America; in 1957 there were
2,250,000 Methodists in Great Britain, 12,000,000 in the United States,
40,000,000 in the world. 65 Outside of its own membership it influenced
other denominations; so, in the Anglican Church that rejected Methodism,
Methodist ideals aroused the Evangelical movement in the later half of
the eighteenth century, and may have entered into the Oxford movement of
the nineteenth. Politically the results were a conservative resignation
among the working classes till</p>
<ol start="1848" type="1">
<li>Morally Methodism improved personal conduct and family life among
the poor, shared in reducing electoral and official corruption, shamed
many of the master class out of frivolity and vice, and prepared the
English revulsion against the trade in slaves. Culturally the movement
was negative; it gave the people sacred songs, but it continued the
Puritan hostility to art. From an intellectual point of view it was a
step backward; it based its creed on fear, its ritual on emotion, and
condemned reason as a snare. In the great conflict between faith and
reason it placed all its hopes on faith; it put no trust in the progress
of knowledge and science; it ignored or scorned the Enlightenment that
was setting France on fire. It felt that the sole purpose and meaning of
life were to escape everlasting damnation, and that the one thing needed
for this end was faith in the redeeming death of Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p>In January, 1790, aged eighty- six, Wesley wrote in his Journal: “I
am now an old man, decayed from head to foot. My eyes are dim, my right
hand shakes much, my mouth is hot and dry every morning, I have a
linger- ing fever almost every day. . . . However, blessed be God, I do
not slack my labor. I can preach and write still.” 66 Two months later
he began a speaking tour that lasted five months and took him through
England and Scotland. A year later he died (March 2, 1791). If we judge
greatness by influence he was, barring Pitt, the greatest Englishman of
his times.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>V. OF BEES AND MEN</p>
<p>Two minor figures stop us on our way to David Hume.</p>
<p>Bernard Mandeville was a London physician of French ancestry and</p>
<p>Dutch birth, who published in 1705 a sixpenny ten-page pamphlet in
rol- licking verse, The Grumbling Hive. Its theme was a paradox: that
the pros- perity of the hive is due to the vices of the individual bees
— to their selfish greed, reproductive ecstasy, and collective
pugnacity. Applying the para- dox to the human hive, the impish doctor
held that the wealth and strength of the state depend not upon the
virtues of its citizens but upon those vices which grumbling moralists
foolishly condemn. For let us imagine what would happen if all
acquisitiveness, vanity, dishonesty, and pugnacity were suddenly to end
— if men and women ate only so much food as they re- quired, wore only
so much clothing as would suffice to protect them against the elements,
never cheated or injured one another, never quarreled, al- ways paid
their debts, scorned luxuries, and were faithful to their mates. At once
the whole society would come to a standstill: the lawyers would starve,
the judges would be left without cases or bribes, doctors would waste
away for lack of patients, winegrowers would go bankrupt, taverns would
fail for lack of tipplers, millions of artisans producing fancy foods,
ornaments, raiment, or houses would be thrown out of work, no one would
want to be a soldier; soon the society would be conquered and
enslaved.</p>
<p>The doggerel form of The Grumbling Hive debarred it from influence.
Piqued, the vain, acquisitive, pugnacious doctor reissued it in 1714,
and again in 1723, as The Fable of the Bees, repeatedly enlarged with
prefaces, notes, and commentaries that expanded ten pages into two
volumes. This time England and France listened, for these appendages
constituted one of the most biting analyses of human nature ever
written.</p>
<p>Mandeville took the third Earl of Shaftesbury as literally his piece
de resistance, for the Earl had interpreted human nature with optimistic
elo- quence, and had assumed in man an innate “sense of right and wrong
. . . as natural to us as natural affection, and being a first principle
in our consti- tution.” 67 Pretty nonsense, answered Mandeville; human
nature, before edu - cation and moral training, makes no distinction
between virtue and vice, but is governed solely by self-interest. He
agreed with the theologians that man is by nature “evil” 〔lawless〕 ;
but instead of threatening men with hell, he complimented them on the
clever adaptation of individual vice to social good. So private
prostitution protects public chastity; 68 the greed for prod- ucts and
services stimulates invention, supports manufactures and trade; great
fortunes make possible philanthropy and massive art. While the theo-
logians preached austerity Mandeville defended luxury, and argued that
the</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>H9</p>
<p>desire for luxuries (i.e., anything but the bare necessities of life)
is the root of industry and civilization; remove all luxury, and we
would be savages again. While the moralists were supposed to condemn
war, it was by the ability to wage war, said Mandeville, that a nation
survived, for most states were beasts of prey.</p>
<p>He saw no morality in nature. Good and bad are words applicable to
social or antisocial actions in man; but Nature herself pays no heed to
our words or homilies; she defines virtue as any quality that makes for
survival; and in our prejudiced terms the world of nature is a scene of
voracity, lust, cruelty, slaughter, and meaningless waste. Yet out of
that awful struggle, Mandeville thought, man had evolved language,
social organization, and moral codes as instruments of social cohesion
and collective survival. Praise and blame are not warranted by nature,
but they are justified as means by which, appealing to man’s vanity,
fear, and pride, we may encourage in others forms of action advantageous
to ourselves or the group.</p>
<p>Nearly everybody who heard of Mandeville berated him as a cynical
materialist. Voltaire, however, agreed with him on the beneficence of
lux- uries, and the laissez-faire physiocrats of France applauded his
view that if human greed is let alone it will make the wheels of
industry hum. The whimsical doctor would probably have admitted that his
paradox “Private</p>
<p>How different from this scandalous doctor was Francis Hutcheson!</p>
<p>Born in Ireland of a Presbyterian minister, he diverged from the
paternal groove and opened a private academy in Dublin. There, conscious
of his obligation to turn young savages into citizens, he wrote an
Inquiry con- cerning Moral Good and Evil ( 1725), in which he defined a
good citizen as one that promoted the general good; and (anticipating
verbatim utilitarian Bentham’s formula) he described the general good as
“the greatest happi - ness of the greatest number.” 69 Promoted to the
chair of moral philosophy in the University of Glasgow, he troubled the
Presbytery by defending the right of private judgment, the legitimacy of
pleasure, and “the ingenious arts of music, sculpture, pai nting, and
even the manly diversions.” 70 He did not share Mandeville’s pessimistic
conception of human nature. He admitted the faults and sins of men,
their wild passions and violent crimes; “but the greatest part of their
lives is employed in offices of natural affection, friend- ship,
innocent self- love, or love of country.” And he added a wholesome
caution to historians:</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Men are apt to let their imaginations run out upon all the robberies,
piracies, murders, perjuries, frauds, massacres, assassinations they
have ever either heard of, or read in history; thence concluding all
man-</p>
<p>kind to be very wicked; as if a court of justice were the proper
place for making an estimate of the morals of mankind, or an hospital of
the healthfulness of a climate. Ought they not to consider that the
number of honest citizens and farmers far surpasses that of all sorts of
criminals in any state; . . . that it is the rarity of crimes, in
comparision of</p>
<p>innocent or good actions, which engages our attention to them, and
makes them to be recorded in history; while incomparably more</p>
<p>honest, generous domestic actions are overlooked, only because they
are so common; as one great danger, or one month’s sicknes s, shall
become a frequently repeated story, during a long life of health and
safety. 71</p>
<p>Here was a healthy mind!</p>

<li>DAVID HUME: 1711-76</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Young Philosopher</li>
</ol>
<p>Hutcheson was a modest part of the “Scottish Enlightenment”; Hume was
its greatest luminary. In his simple eight-page autobiography he tells
us that he was born at Edinburgh April 26, 17 1 1, “of a good family,
both by father and mother; my father’s family is a branch of the Earl of
Home’s or Hume’s.* . . . My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer,
Presi- dent of the College of Justice.” The father died in 1712, leaving
the estate</p>
<p>At the age of twelve he entered the University of Edinburgh. After
three years he left without a degree, resolved to give himself
completely to litera- ture and philosophy. At sixteen he wrote to a
friend reproaching himself because</p>
<p>my peace of mind is not sufficiently confirmed by philosophy to</p>
<p>withstand the blows of fortune. This greatness and elevation of
soul</p>

Britain. “Home” was and is pronounced “Hume.”</li>

<p>is to be found only in study and contemplation. … You must allow</p>
<ul>
<li>me〕 to talk t hus like a philosoper; ’tis a subject I think much
on, and could talk all day long of . 73</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon his religious faith faded away:</p>
<p>I found a certain boldness of temper growing on me, which was</p>
<p>not inclined to submit to any authority in these subjects
〔philosophy and literature〕 . . . When I was about eighteen years of
age there</p>
<p>seemed to be opened up a new scene of thought, which transported me
beyond measure, and made me, with an ardor natural to young</p>
<p>men, throw up every other pleasure or business to apply entirely to
it. 74</p>
<p>He said later that “he never had entertained any belief in religion
since he began to read Locke and Clarke.” 75 By the time he was
seventeen he had already planned a treatise on philosophy.</p>
<p>His relatives urged upon him that philosophy and eighty pounds a year
would give him but a meager existence; he must reconcile himself to
making money. Could he not study law? He tried for three painful
years</p>
<p>(1726-29). His health broke down, and almost his spirit too; for a
time he lost his interest in ideas. “The law appeared nauseous to me”;
76 he aban - doned it, and returned to philosophy, with perhaps one
deviation. Toward the end of February, 1734, he left Edinburgh for
London “to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active
scene of life.” 77 On March 5 Agnes Galbraith appeared before the
Reverend George Home (David’s uncle), and confessed that she was with
child. Brought before a session of the kirk , she declared “that
Mr. David Home … is the father.” Doubting her veracity, the session
remitted her to the next meeting of the local Presbytery; before this,
on June 25, she repeated the accusation. According to the minutes of the
Presbytery of Chirnside,</p>
<p>the moderator . . . exhorted her to be ingenuous and confess if
any</p>
<p>other person was guilty with her. . . . The Presbytery having
con-</p>
<p>sidered the affair, and being informed that the said David Home was
gone out of the Kingdom, they remitted her to the Session of Chyrn-
side, to make satisfaction to the rules of the Church . 78</p>
<p>This required that she should appear in sackcloth before the kirk,
and be exposed in the pillory on three Sundays. In 1739 Agnes was again
convicted of fornication.</p>
<p>After a stop in London Hume proceeded to Bristol, and took a position
in a merchant’s office. “In a few months I found that scene totally
unsuit - able to me.” He crossed over to France, where he could live
more c heaply</p>
<p>I 4 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>than in England. For a while he stayed at Reims; then he moved to La
Fleche (some 150 miles southwest of Paris), for the Jesuit college there
had an extensive library. The canny Scot entered into cordial relations
with the priests, and was allowed to use their books. One of the fathers
described him in later perspective as “too full of himself; … his spirit
more lively than solid, his imagination more luminous than profound, his
heart too dissipated with material objects and spiritual self-idolatry
to pierce into the sacred recesses of divine truths.” 79</p>
<p>In the shade of the Jesuits Hume composed the first two books of his
skeptical masterpiece, A Treatise of Human Nature. In September, 1737,
he returned to England bursting with manuscript. He had trouble with
publishers, for in December he wrote to Henry Home: “I am at present
castrating my work, that is, cutting out its noble parts, . . .
endeavoring it shall give as little offense as possible.” 80 The chief
excisions were “reason - ings concerning miracles”; these were stored
away for use in safer days. The remainder, guaranteed to be
unintelligible to antedeluvians, was published anonymously in two
volumes in January, 1739, by John Noon of London. Hume sold the volumes
outright for fifty pounds and twelve copies — not so bad a bargain for a
book on logic and theory of knowledge by an unknown youth of
twenty-seven. However, it was one of the peaks of modern philosophy.</p>
<p>2 . Reason Deflated</p>
<p>The introductory “Advertisement” revealed Hume’s confidence in his
powers: he proposed to study human nature in understanding and passions,
and, in a third volume forthcoming, in morals and politics. He proceeded
to analyze “impression” (sensation), perception, memory, imagination,
thought, reason, and belief. This investigation of how we come to know
is fundamental, for the validity of science, philosophy, religion, and
history depends upon the nature, origin, and reliability of knowledge.
It is a diffi- cult discipline, for it deals with abstract ideas rather
than with concrete objects; and thought is the last thing that thought
seeks to understand.</p>
<p>Hume begins by accepting as a starting point the empiricism of Locke:
all ideas are ultimately derived from experience through impressions.
These are external sensations like light, sound, heat, pressure, odors,
taste, or in- ternal sensations like stupor, hunger, pleasure, pain. A
perception is a sensa- tion interpreted; “noise” is a sensation, but “a
knock at the door” is a per - ception. (Hume is not always precise or
consistent in his use of these terms.) A man born blind or deaf has no
idea of light or sound, because he has had no sensation of either. The
ideas of space and time are derived from ex-</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>perience: the first is “the idea of visible or tangible points
distributed in a certain order”; the second is the perception of
sequence in our impressions . 81 Ideas differ from impressions only in
the lesser “force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind .”
82 Belief “is nothing but a more vivid and intense conception of any
idea; … it is something felt by the mind,</p>
<p>which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of
the imagination .” 83</p>
<p>In these definitions Hume seems to think of “the mind” as a real
entity or agent experiencing, possessing, remembering, or judging
impressions or ideas. As he proceeds, however, he denies the existence
of any mind addi- tional to the mental states — to the impression,
perception, idea, feeling, or desire occupying consciousness at the
moment.</p>
<p>That which we call a mind is nothing but a heap or collection of</p>
<p>different perceptions, united together by different relations, and
sup- posed, though falsely, to be endowed with a perfect simplicity
and</p>
<p>identity. . . . For my part, when I enter most intimately into what
I</p>
<p>call myself , I aways stumble on some particular perception or other,
of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I
never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and can
never</p>
<p>observe anything but the perception. When my perceptions are re-</p>
<p>moved for any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible of</p>
<p>myself , and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my
percep-</p>
<p>tions removed by death, and could I neither think, nor feel, nor see,
nor love, nor hate, after the dissolution of my body, I should be
en-</p>
<p>tirely annihilated; nor do I conceive what is further requisite to
make me a perfect nonentity. . . . Aside from some metaphysicians . .
.</p>
<p>I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind that they are nothing
but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed
each</p>
<p>other with inconceivable rapidity, and are in perpetual flux. . . .
The</p>
<p>successive perceptions . . . constitute the mind . 84</p>
<p>So, at one blow from this brash youth, three philosophies fell:
materialism, for (as Berkeley had shown) we never perceive “matter,” and
know noth - ing but our mental world of ideas and feelings; and
spiritualism, for we never perceive a “spirit” additional to our
particular and passing feelings and ideas; and immortality, for there is
no “mind” to survive the transitory mental states. Berkeley had
demolished materialism by reducing matter to mind; Hume compounded the
destruction by reducing mind to ideas. Neither “matter” nor “mind”
exists. Forgivably the wits of the time dis - missed both philosophers
with “No matter; never mind.”</p>
<p>Freedom of will, in this dissolving view, is impossible: there is no
mind to choose between ideas or responses; the succession of mental
states is de- termined by the order of impressions, the association of
ideas, and the alter-</p>
<p>144 THE a GE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>nation of desires; “will” is merely an idea flowing into action.
Personal identity is the feeling of continuity when one mental state
recalls previous mental states and relates them through the idea of
cause.</p>
<p>But cause too is only an idea; we cannot show it to be an objective
reality. When we perceive that A (e.g., flame) is regularly followed by
B (heat) , we conclude that A has caused B; but all that we have
observed is a se- quence of events, not a causal operation; we cannot
know that B will al- ways follow A. “All our reasonings concerning cause
and effect are derived from nothing but custom .” 85 The “laws of
nature” that we talk of are merely sequences customary in our
experience; they are not invariable and necessary connections in events;
there is no guarantee that they will hold tomorrow. Science, therefore,
is an accumulation of probabilities subject to change without notice.
Metaphysics, if it pretends to be a system of truths about ultimate
reality, is impossible, for we can know neither the “causes” behind
sequences nor the “matter” behind sensations nor the “mind” allegedly
behind the ideas. And so far as we base our belief in God on a chain of
causes and effects supposedly leading back to a “Prime Mover Unmoved,”
we must abandon that Aristotelian sophistry. All things flow, and
certainty is a dream.</p>
<p>After spreading devastation about him with the invincible Excalibur
of his intellect, Hume pauses for a moment of modesty. “When I reflect
on the natural fallibility of my judgment, I have less confidence in my
opinions than when I consider the objects concerning which I reason .”
86 He knows as well as we do that certainty is not necessary for life,
nor for religion, nor even for science; that a high degree of
probability suffices for crossing a street or building a cathedral, or
saving our souls. In an appendix he ad- mits that there might be, after
all, a self behind ideas, a reality behind sen- sations, a causal
connection behind persistent sequences. Theoretically he stands his
ground: “I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any very
considerable mistakes in the reasonings delivered in the preceding vol-
umes .” 87 But in practice, he amiably confesses, he abandons his
skepticism as soon as he drops his pen.</p>
<p>Should it be asked me whether I sincerely assent to this argument</p>
<p>which I have been to such pains to inculcate, and whether I be really
one of those skeptics who hold that all is uncertain, … I should</p>
<p>reply . . . that neither I nor any other person was ever sincerely
and</p>
<p>constantly of that opinion . 88 … I dine, I play backgammon, I
con-</p>
<p>verse and am merry with my friends; and when, after three or four</p>
<p>hours’ amusement, I would return to these speculations, they appear
so cold and strained and ridiculous that I cannot find in my heart
to</p>
<p>enter into them any further . 89 . . . Thus the skeptic still
continues</p>
<p>to reason and believe, though he asserts that he cannot defend his
rea-</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>H5</p>
<p>son by reason; and by the same rule he must assent to the principle
concerning the existence of body, though he cannot pretend, by any
arguments of philosophy, to maintain its veracity .” 90</p>
<p>In the end Hume turns his back upon argument as a guide to life, and
trusts to animal faith, to the belief, based upon custom, that reality
is ra- tional, permeated with causality. And by asserting that “belief
is more properly an act of the sensitive than of the cognitive part of
our natures ,” 91 Hume, twenty-seven, holds out his hand to Jean Jacques
Rousseau, twenty- six, in youth and theory, as he was destined to do
later in friendship and tragedy. The cleverest reasoner in the Age of
Reason not only impeached the causal principle of reason, he opened a
door to the Romantic reaction that would depose reason and make feeling
its god.</p>
<p>The second “book” and volume of the Treatise continues the dethrone -
ment of reason. Hume rejects the attempts of philosophers to build an
ethic upon the control of passion by reaso n. By “passion” Hume means
emotional desire. “In order to show the fallacy of all this philosophy,
I shall endeavor to prove, first, that reason alone can never be a
motive for any action of the will; and secondly, that it can never
oppose passion in the direction 〔against the force〕 of the will .” 92
“Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of pas - sion but a contrary
impulse” (an echo of Spinoza?). To still further epater</p>
<p>He proceeds to a subtle analysis of the “passions”— chiefly love,
hate, compassion, anger, ambition, envy, and pride. “The relation which
pro - duces most commonly the passion of pride is that of property .” 94
All pas - sions are based upon pleasure and pain; and ultimately our
moral distinctions have the same secret source. “We tend to give the
name of virtue to any quality in others that gives us pleasure by making
for our advantage, and to give the name of vice to any human quality
that gives us pain .” 95 Even the concepts of beauty and ugliness are
derived from pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>If we consider all the hypotheses which have been formed … to</p>
<p>explain the difference betwixt beauty and deformity, we shall
find</p>
<p>that all of them resolve into this, that beauty is such an order and
con- struction of parts as, either by the primary constitution of our
nature 〔as in the beauty of the human body〕, by custom 〔as in
admiring</p>
<p>slenderness in women〕, or by caprice 〔as in the idealizing
delusions of impeded desire〕, is fitted to give pleasure and
satisfaction to the</p>
<p>soul. . . . Pleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary
at-</p>
<p>tendants of beauty and deformity, but constitute their very
essence.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>. .’. Beauty is nothing but a form which produces pleasure, as
de-</p>
<p>formity is a structure of parts which conveys pain. 86</p>
<p>Love between the sexes is compounded of this sense of beauty, plus
“the bodily appetite for generation and a generous kindness and good
will.” 97 In March, 1739, Hume returned to Edinburgh. He eagerly
searched the journals for reviews of his two volumes, and suffered the
consequences. “Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my T
reatise of Human Nature. It fell dead-born from the press, without
reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots.”
98 But when he wrote this in old age he had forgotten, perhaps through
oblivescence of the disagreeable, that several reviews appeared within a
year after the publication of his book. Nearly all of them complained
that it was hard to understand, and that the author allowed his youth to
show by frequent references to himself and to the epochal novelty of his
ideas. “What is most offensive,” said a typical censor, “is the
confidence with which he delivers his paradoxes. Never has there been a
Pyrrhonian more dogmatic. . . . The Lockes and Clarkes are often, in his
eyes, but paltry and superficial reasoners in com- parison with
himself.” 99</p>
<p>Saddened but resolute, Hume prepared for the press the third volume
of his Treatise, containing Book III, “Of Morals.” It appeared on
November 5, 1 740. Its analysis of morality displeased the rationalists
as much as the theo- logians. The rules of morality are not supernatural
revelations, but neither are they the conclusions of reason, for
“reason,” Hume repeats, “has no in - fluence on our passions or
actions.” 100 Our moral sense comes not from Heaven but from sympathy —
fellow feeling with our fellow men; and this feeling is part of the
social instinct by which, fearing isolation, we seek as sociation with
others. “Man’s very first state and situation may justly be esteemed
social”; a “state of nature” in which men lived without social or -
ganization “is to be regarded as a mere fiction”; 101 society is as old
as man. Being members of a group, men soon learned to commend actions
advan- tageous — and to condemn actions injurious — to the community.
Further- more, the principle of sympathy inclined them to receive or
imitate the opinions that they heard around them; in this way they
acquired their standards and habits of praise and blame, and consciously
or not they ap- plied these judgments to their own conduct; this, and
not the voice of God (as Rousseau and Kant were to imagine) is the
origin of conscience. This law of sympathy, of communal attraction, is,
says Hume, as universal and illuminating in the moral world as the law
of gravitation in the material cosmos. “Thus, upon the whole,” he
concluded, “I am hopeful that nothing is wanting to an accurate proof of
this system of ethics.” 102</p>

<p>Volume III attracted even less attention than Volumes I and II. As
late as 1756 the remnants of the eleven hundred copies that constituted
the first edition of the Treatise w ere still cluttering the publisher’s
shelves. Hume did not live to see a second edition.</p>

<p>It was clear that he could not subsist by his pen. In 1744 he made an
un- successful attempt to secure a professorship in the University of
Edinburgh. Doubtless with some humiliation he accepted (April, 1745) a
position as tutor to the young Marquis of Annandale at a fee of £ 300 a
year. The Marquis went insane; Hume found that he was expected to be the
keeper of a lunatic; there were quarrels; he was dismissed (April,
1746), and had to sue for his salary. For a year (1746-47) he served as
secretary to General James St. Clair; the salary was good, the food was
good, and in July, 1747, Hume returned to Edinburgh owning and weighing
many more pounds than when he left. In 1748 the General re-engaged him,
as secretary and aide-de-camp, on a mission to Turin; now David encased
himself in a flam- ing scarlet uniform. James Caulfield (future Earl of
Charlemont), then a student in Turin, was impressed by Hume’s intellect
and character, but dis - mayed by his flesh.</p>
<p>The powers of physiognomy were baffled by his countenance . . .</p>
<p>to discover the smallest trace of the faculties of his mind in the
un-</p>
<p>meaning features of his visage. His face was broad and fat, his mouth
wide, and without any other expression than that of imbecility. . .
.</p>
<p>The corpulence of his whole person was far better fitted to communi-
cate the idea of a turtle-eating alderman than that of a refined
phi-</p>
<p>losopher. 103</p>
<p>The same Caulfield claims to have seen Hume (aged thirty-seven) on
his knees before a married countess (aged twenty-four), professing his
devo- tion and suffering the pangs of despised love; the lady dismissed
his passion as “a natural operation of your system.” According to the
same reporter</p>
<p>Resolved to get another hearing for the ideas of the Treatise , he
published</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>in 1748 An Enquiry concerning the Human Understanding , and in 1751
An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals . In an “Advertisement”
prefixed to a posthumous edition (1777) of these Enquiries he disclaimed
the Treatise as a “juvenile work,” and asked that “the following pieces
ma y alone be regarded as containing his philosophical sentiments and
princi- ples.” 105 Students of Hume have in general found more meat in
the earlier than the later works; these cover the same ground in perhaps
a less belliger- ent and incisive style, but they reach the same
conclusions.</p>
<p>After repeating his skeptical analysis of reason, Hume offered, as
Section X of the first Enquiry , that essay “Of Miracles” which the
publisher had refused to print in the Treatise. He began with his usual
self- assurance: “I flatter myself that I have discovered an argument .
. . which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting
check to all kinds of supersti- tious delusion, and consequently will be
useful as long as the world en- dures.” And then he let loose his most
famous paragraphs:</p>
<p>No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the
testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous
than</p>
<p>the fact which it endeavors to establish. . . . When anyone tells
me</p>
<p>that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with
myself whether it be more probable that this person should either de-
ceive or be deceived, or that the fact which he relates should
really</p>
<p>have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and accord-
ing to the superiority which I discover I . . . reject the greater</p>
<p>miracle. There is not to be found in all history any miracle attested
by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, educa-
tion, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves;
of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicions
of</p>
<p>any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the
eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being
de-</p>
<p>tected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts
per-</p>
<p>formed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of
the</p>
<p>world, as to render the detection unavoidable: all which
circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony
of men. . . .</p>
<p>The maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our rea-</p>
<p>sonings is that the objects of which we have no experience resemble
those of which we have; that what we have found to be most usual</p>
<p>is always most probable; and that where there is an opposition of
argu- ments, we ought to give the preference to such as are founded
on</p>
<p>the greatest number of past observations. … It forms a strong
pre-</p>
<p>sumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that they
are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations.</p>
<p>… It is strange . . . that such prodigious events never happen in
our</p>
<p>days. But it is nothing strange . . . that men should lie in all
ages. 106</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>Hume went on to allege other obstacles to Christian belief: the calm
neu- trality of nature as between man and his rivals on the earth; the
prolific variety of evils in life and history; the apparent
responsibility of God for Adam’s sin, and for all sins, in a world where
by Christian hypothesis noth - ing can happen without God’s consent. To
avoid the charge of atheism, Hume put into the mouth of “a friend who
loves skeptical paradoxes,” and whose principles “I can by no means
approve,” a defense of Epicurus’ fancy that the gods exist, but pay no
attention to mankind. The friend wonders why there cannot be an
agreement between religion and philosophy not to molest each other, as
he supposes there was in Hellenistic civilization:</p>
<p>After the first alarm was over, which arose from the new paradoxes
and principles of the philosophers, these teachers seem ever after, dur-
ing the ages of antiquity, to have lived in great harmony with the</p>
<p>established superstition, and to have made a fair partition of
mankind between them: the former claiming all the learned and wise, the
latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate. 107</p>
<p>What a way to offer a truce!</p>
<p>In 1749 Hume returned to Scotland to live with his brother and sister
on their estate at Ninewells. Two years later John Home took a wife, and
David moved to Edinburgh. Now he sent to the press the Enquiry concern-
ing the Principles of Morals which he hoped would replace the third
volume of the Treatise. He reaffirmed the derivation of the moral sense
from sym- pathy or social feelings; he rejected the Socratic
identification of virtue with intelligence, and emphatically repudiated
La Rochefo ucauld’s notion that “altruistic” actions are egoistically
motivated by the hope of pleasure from the social esteem they are
expected to earn. The pleasure that we feel in such actions, said Hume,
is not their cause but their accompaniment and result; the actions
themselves are the operation of our social instincts. 108</p>
<p>But the most noticeable feature of this second Enquiry is its
elaboration of a utilitarian ethic. Twenty-three years after Hutcheson,
thirty-eight years before Bentham, Hume defined virtue as “every quality
of the mind which is useful or agreeable to the person himself or to
others.” 109 On this basis he justified the healthy pleasures of life as
useful to the individual, and the double standard of morality as useful
to society.</p>
<p>The long and helpless infancy of men requires the combination of</p>
<p>parents for the subsistence of their young; and that combination re-
quires the virtue of chastity or fidelity to the marriage bed. . . .
An</p>
<p>infidelity of this nature is much more pernicious in women than
in</p>
<p>men. Hence the laws of chastity are much stricter over the one sex
than over the other. 110</p>
<p>1 50</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>Of this Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals the fond author
wrote: “In my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), it
is, of all my writings, . . . incomparably the best.” He added: “It came
unnoticed and unobserved into the world.” 111</p>
<p>4 . Darwinism and Christianity</p>
<p>In 1751 he composed Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. Of all the
productions of his Mephistophelean mood this is the most devastating and
irreverent. Three persons converse: Demea, who defends orthodoxy,
Cleanthes the deist, and Philo, who is transparently Hume. Demea argues
that unless we posit some Supreme Intelligence behind phenomena, the
world becomes unbearably unintelligible; but he admits that his God is
quite incomprehensible to human reason. 112 Cleanthes reproaches Demea
for try- ing to explain one unintelligibility wi th another; he prefers
to prove God’s existence by the evidences of design in nature. Philo
laughs at both argu- ments. Reason, he claims, can never explain the
world or prove God. “What peculiar privilege has this little agitation
of the brain called thought, that we must make it the model of the whole
universe?” 113 As for design, the adapta - tion of organs to purposes
may have resulted not from divine guidance but from nature’s slow and
bungling experiments through thousands of years. 114 (Here i s “natural
selection” 1,800 years after Lucretius, 108 years before Darwin.) And
even if we admit supernatural design, the imperfection of the
adaptations and the myriad sufferings in the human and animal world
reveal at best a god of limited powers and intelligence, or one quite
indifferent to mankind. “Ultimately the life of a man is of no greater
importance to the universe than the life of an oyster.” 115</p>
<p>One would imagine that this grand production has not received the</p>
<p>last hand of the maker, so little finished is every part, and so
coarse</p>
<p>are the strokes with which it is executed. Thus the winds . . .
assist</p>
<p>men in navigation; but how oft, rising up to tempests and hurricanes,
do they become pernicious! Rains are necessary to nourish all the</p>
<p>plants and animals of the earth; but how often are they defective!
how often excessive! . . . There is nothing so advantageous in the
universe but what frequently becomes pernicious by its excess or defeat;
nor has nature guarded with the requisite accuracy against all disorders
or confusion. 116</p>
<p>Worse yet, there is not only disorder amid the order (if you view the
world as designed), there is, amid the abounding life, an always futile
struggle against death.</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>A perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures.
Necessity,</p>
<p>hunger, want, stimulate the strong and courageous; fear, anxiety,</p>
<p>terror agitate the weak and infirm. The first entrance into life
gives</p>
<p>anguish to the newborn infant and to its wretched parent; weakness,
impotence, distress attend every stage of that life, and it is at
last</p>
<p>finished in agony and horror. . . . Observe, too, . . . the
curious</p>
<p>artifices of nature, in order to embitter the life of every living
being.</p>
<p>. . . Consider that innumerable race of insects, which either are
bred on the body of each animal, or flying about, infix their stings in
him.</p>
<p>. . . Every animal is surrounded with enemies, which incessantly seek
his misery and destruction. . . . Man is the greatest enemy of man.</p>
<p>Oppression, injustice, contempt, contumely, violence, sedition, war,
calumny, treachery, fraud; by these they mutually torment each</p>
<p>other . 117 . . .</p>
<p>Look around this universe. What an immense profusion of beings,</p>
<p>animated and organized, sensible and active! You admire this pro-</p>
<p>digious variety and fecundity. But inspect a little more narrowly
these living existences. . . . How hostile and destructive to each
other! . . .</p>
<p>The whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind nature,
impreg-</p>
<p>nated by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth from her
lap,</p>
<p>without discernment or parental care, her maimed and abortive chil-
dren . 118</p>
<p>The conflicting evidences of good and evil in the world suggest to
Philo a duality or multiplicity of competing gods, some of them “good,”
some “bad,” and perhaps of diverse sex. He maliciously suggests that the
world</p>
<p>was only the first rude essay of some infant deity, who
afterwards</p>
<p>abandoned it, ashamed of his lame performance; … or it is the
pro-</p>
<p>duction of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity, and, ever
since his death, has run on at adventure, from the first impulse and</p>
<p>active force which it received from him . 119</p>
<p>As like as not the world, as the Brahmins asserted, “arose from an
infinite spider, who spun this whole complicated mass from his bowels. .
. . Why may not an orderly system be spun from the belly as well as the
brain ?” 120 So creation would be gener ation. Or conceivably “the world
is an animal and the deity is the soul of the world, actuating it and
actuated by it .” 121 After all this badinage Philo comes back to
design, and admits that “the cause or causes of order in the universe
probably bear some analogy to hu- man intelligence .” 122 And he
apologizes for his scandalous cosmologies:</p>
<p>I must confess that I am less cautious on the subject of natural
reli-</p>
<p>gion than on any other. . . . You in particular, Cleanthes, with
whom</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>I live in unreserved intimacy, you are sensible that
notwithstanding</p>
<p>the freedom of my conversation, and my love of singular arguments, no
one has a deeper sense of religion impressed upon his mind, or pays more
profund adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself to reason
in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature. A purpose, an
intention, or design strikes everywhere the most careless, the most
stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems as at
all times to reject it. 123</p>
<p>Despite this peace offering, Hume’s friends pleaded with him not to
pub - lish the Dialogues. He yielded, and locked the manuscript in his
desk; it did not see print till 1779, three years after his death. But
his fascination with religion lured him back to the subject, and in 1757
he published Four Dis- sertations, of which one attempted a “Natural
History of Religion.” At his publisher’s insistence he withdrew two
other essays, which were printed when he was beyond fear and reproach:
one on immortality, the other a justification of suicide when a person
has become a burden to his fellow men.</p>
<p>The Natural History combines Hume’s old interest in religion with his
new interest in history. He has passed beyond attacking old beliefs to
in- quiring how mankind came to adopt them. But he is not inclined to
patient research, even among the scanty materials then available on
social origins; he prefers to approach the problem by psychological
analysis and deductive reasoning. The mind of primitive man interpreted
all causation on the anal- ogy of his own volition and action: behind
the works and forms of nature — rivers, oceans, mountains, storms,
pestilences, prodigies, etc. — he imagined acts of will by hidden
persons of supernatural power; hence polytheism was the first form of
religious belief. Since many forces or events were harmful to man, fear
had a large share in his myths and rituals; he personi- fied and sought
to propitiate these evil forces or demons. Perhaps (Hume slyly suggests)
Calvin’s God was a demon, cruel, malicious, arbitrary, and difficult to
appease. 124 Since the good gods were conceived as like human beings
except in power and permanence, they were supposed to give aid and
comfort in return for gifts and flattery; hence the rituals of
offerings, sacrifices, adoration, and solicitous prayer. As social
organization increased in size and reach, and local rulers submitted to
greater kings, the world of divinities underwent a like transformation;
an order of hierarchy and obedi- ence was ascribed in imagination to the
gods; monotheism grew out of poly- theism, and while the populace still
knelt to local deities or saints, cultured men worshiped Zeus, Jupiter,
God.</p>
<p>Unfortunately religion became more intolerant as it became more
unified. Polytheism had allowed many varieties of religious belief;
monotheism de- manded uniformity. Persecution spread, and the cry for
orthodoxy became</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>“the most furious and implacable of all human passions.” 125
Philosophy, which among the ancients had been left relatively free as
the religion of the elite, was compelled to become the servant and
apologist of the faith of the masses. In these monotheistic creeds —
Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedan- ism — merit and “salvation” were more
and more divorced from virtue and attached to ritual observance and
unquestioning belief. In consequence edu- cated persons became either
martyrs or hypocrites; and as they rarely chose martyrdom, the life of
man was tarnished with lip service and insincerity.</p>
<p>In less combative moods Hume condoned a measure of hypocrisy. When he
was consulted as to whether a young clergyman who had lost his faith
should remain in the Church and accept its preferments, David answered,
Remain.</p>
<p>Civil employments for men of letters can scarcely be found. . . .</p>
<p>It is putting too great a respect on the vulgar and their
superstition</p>
<p>to pique oneself on sincerity with regard to them. Did ever one make
it a point of honor to speak the truth to children or madmen? . . .</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical profession only adds a little more to our
innocent</p>
<p>dissimulation, or rather simulation, without which it is impossible
to pass through the world. 126</p>
<p>S. Communism and ’Democracy</p>
<p>Tiring at last of debate on issues that on his own view were
determined by feeling rather than by reason, Hume in his later years
turned more and more to politics and history. In 1752 he published
Political Discourses. He was surprised by its favorable reception.
Britain was glad to forget the de- structiveness of his theology in the
conservatism of his politics.</p>
<p>He had some sympathy with aspirations toward a communistic
equality:</p>
<p>It must indeed be confessed that nature is so liberal to mankind
that, were all her presents equally divided among the species, and
improved by art and industry, every individual would enjoy all the
necessaries, and even most of the comforts, of life. … It must also be
confessed that</p>
<p>wherever we depart from this equality we rob the poor of more</p>
<p>satisfaction than we add to the rich, and that the slight
gratification of a frivolous vanity in one individual frequently costs
more than</p>
<p>bread to many families and even provinces.</p>
<p>But he felt that human nature makes an egalitarian utopia
impossible.</p>
<p>Historians, and even common sense, may inform us that however</p>
<p>precious these ideas of perfect equality may seem, they are
really</p>
<p>at bottom impracticable ; and were they not so, would be
extremely</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>pernicious to human society. Render possessions ever so equal, men’s
different degrees of art, care, and industry will immediately break</p>
<p>that equality. Or if you check these virtues . . . the most
rigorous</p>
<p>inquisition is requisite to watch every inequality on its first
appearance, and the most severe jurisdiction to punish and redress it. .
. . So much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny. 127</p>
<p>Democracy, like communism, received Hume’s sympathetic rejection. It
is, he thought, “a principle . . . noble in itself, . . . but belied by
all</p>
<p>experience, that the peo ple are the origin of all just government.”
128 He</p>
<p>Almost all the governments which exist at present, or of which</p>
<p>there remains any record in history, have been founded originally</p>
<p>either on usurpation or conque st or both, without any pretense
of</p>
<p>a fair consent or voluntary subjection of the people. … It is
prob-</p>
<p>able that the first ascendant of man over multitudes began in a state
of war. . . . The long continuance of that state, . . . common among</p>
<p>savage tribes, inured the people to submission. 129</p>
<p>In this way monarchy became the almost universal, the most lasting,
and therefore presumably the most practical, form of government. “An
heredi - tary prince, a nobility without vassals, a people voting by
their representa- tives, form the best monarchy, aristocracy, and
democracy.” 130</p>
<p>Besides disposing in advance of Rousseau, Hume used his lucid Addi-
sonian style to discard in advance Montesquieu’s theory of climate as a
determinant of national character. In Essays, Moral and. Political,
whose second edition appeared almost simultaneously (1748) with The
Spirit of Law s, Hume wrote: “As to physical causes I am inclined to
doubt of their operation in this particular; nor do I think that men owe
anything of their temper or genius to the air, food, or climate.” 131
National character follows national boundaries rather than climatic
zones; it is determined principally by laws, government, the structure
of society, the occupations of the peo- ple, and the imitation of
neighbors or superiors.</p>
<p>Under these local varieties human nature is basically the same in all
times and climes; the same motives and instincts, made necessary by the
demands of survival, produce in all ages and places essentially the same
actions and results.</p>
<p>Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship, generosity,
public</p>
<p>spirit: these passions, mixed in various degrees, and distributed
through society, have been from the beginning of the world, and still
are,</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>*55</p>
<p>the source of all the action and enterprises which have been observed
among mankind. Would you know the sentiments, inclinations, and course
of life of the Greeks and Romans? Study well the temper and actions of
the French and English; you cannot be much mistaken in</p>
<p>transferring to the former most of the observations which you have
made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much the same in all
times and places that history informs us of nothing new or strange</p>
<p>in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the constant
and</p>
<p>universal principles of human nature, by showing men in all varieties
of circumstances and situations, and furnishes us with materials from
which we may form our observations and become acquainted with</p>
<p>the regular springs of human action and behavior. These records
of</p>
<p>wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions are so many collections
of</p>
<p>experiments, by which the political or moral philosopher fixes
the</p>
<p>principles of his science . 132</p>
<p>In the Political Discourses , and in Essays and Treatises on Various
Sub- jects (1753) Hume made substantial contributions to economic
thought. He rejected the view of the French physiocrats that all taxes
fall ultimately upon land; they fall at last, he believed, upon labor,
for (here he echoes Locke) “everything in the world is purchased by
labor .” 133 Even before the Industrial Revolution had taken form he
foresaw that the workers would “heighten their wages” by combination. He
condemned the financing of governmental expenditures and enterprises by
high taxes and frequent bond issues, and predicted that such fiscal
measures would bring “free govern - ments” to “the same state of
servitude with all the nations that surround us .” 134 Money is not
wealth; to mint more of it than is needed for the con - venience of
commerce is to raise prices and hamper foreign trade. The false
mercantile theory that still led European states to stress exports,
block im- ports, and accumulate gold would deprive Europe of the
international ben- efits derivable from the ability of each nation,
through soil and climate and special skills, to produce specific goods
at minimal cost and of optimal qual- ity. He dared to pray,</p>
<p>not only as a man but as a British subject, . . . for the flourishing
com- merce of Germany, Spain, Italy, and even France itself. I am at
least</p>
<p>certain that Great Britain and all those nations would flourish
more</p>
<p>did their sovereigns and ministers adopt such enlarged and benevolent
sentiments towards each other. . . . The increase of riches and com-
merce in any one nation, instead of hurting, commonly promotes the
riches and commerce of all its neighbors . 135</p>
<p>These ideas, perhaps influenced by the laissez-faire physiocrats,
influenced in their turn Hume’s friend Adam Smith, played a part in
developing a</p>

<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>British policy of free trade, and are finding fulfillment in Western
Europe today.</p>
<p>6 . History</p>
<p>In 1752, after a campaign of the orthodox party against him as an
insolent infidel, Hume was elected keeper of the library of the Faculty
of Advo- cates in Edinburgh. Despite the modest salary of forty pounds a
year, the appointment meant much to him, for it made him master of
thirty thousand volumes. It was through access to this library that he
was able to write his History of England. In 1748 he had confessed to a
friend: “I have long had an intention, in my riper years, of composing
some history.” 136 He called history “the great mistress of wisdom”; 137
he hoped to discover in it the causes of the rise and fall of nations;
besides,</p>
<p>to see all the human race pass as it were in review before us,
appearing in their true colors, without any of those disguises which,
during</p>
<p>their lifetime, so much perplexed the judgment of beholders — what
spectacle can be imagined so magnificent, so various, so interesting?
What amusement, either of the senses or of the imagination, can be
compared with it? 138</p>
<p>It is one of the glories of the eighteenth century that it produced
within a generation thre e of the world’s greatest historians: Voltaire,
Hume, and Gibbon, all grounded in philosophy, seeking to reinterpret
history in non- theological terms, and in the broadest perspective of
the knowledge accu- mulated by their time. Gibbon never tired of
praising Hume and acknowl- edging his influence; he valued Hume’s praise
of the initial volume of The</p>
<p>Hume wrote his History backward. Its first volume (1754) covered the
reigns of James I and Charles I — the years 1603-49; the second (175 6)
ran from 1649 to 1688; the third and fourth (1759), from 1485 to 1603;
the fifth and sixth (1761), from the invasion of England by Julius
Caesar to the accession of Henry VII in 1485.</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>*57</p>
<p>The furor of criticism that fell upon the first volume surprised him.
He believed that the domination of England by the Whigs since their
importa- tion of William III in 1688, and their fear of the Jacobite
revolts of 1715 and 1745, had discolored English historiography with
anti-Stuart passion; and he supposed that he was f ree from contrary
predilections. “I thought that I was the only historian that had at once
neglected present power, in- terest, and authority, and the cry of
popular prejudice.” 139 He forgot that he was a Scot, that Scotland was
still secretly mourning her Bonnie Prince Charlie, and that the Scots,
probably including Hume, had never forgiven England for killing the
half-Scot Charles I and bringing in first a Dutchman and then a German
to rule England, Scotland, and Wales. So, while admit- ting that Charles
had overstretched the royal prerogative and deserved to be dethroned, he
pictured Parliament as likewise overreaching its privilege and equally
guilty of the Civil War. He admitted the right of the nation to depose a
bad king, but he wished that no one had ever pushed that right to
extremes; he feared the “fury and injustice of the people,” and felt
that - tified hypocrites,” who “polluted” their language with
“mysterious jargon” and “interlaced their iniquities with prayers.” 140
He dismissed the Common - wealth as a period of murderous piety,
military tyranny, and social dis- order, cured only by the Stuart
Restoration. Voltaire, reviewing the His- tory , thought Hume quite
impartial:</p>
<p>Mr. Hume … is neither pro-Parliament nor royalist, neither</p>
<p>Anglican nor Presbyterian; he is simply judicial. . . . The fury
of</p>
<p>parties has for a long time deprived England of a good historian
as</p>
<p>well as of a good government. What a Tory wrote was disowned by</p>
<p>the Whigs, who in their turn were given the lie by the Tories. . .
.</p>
<p>But in the new historian we find a mind superior to his materials; he
speaks of weaknesses, blunders, cruelties as a physician speaks of epi-
demic diseases . 141</p>
<p>British critics did not agree with Voltaire. They did not complain
that Hume had seldom consulted original sources, but (he recalled)
he</p>
<p>was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even
detesta- tion: English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig and Tory, churchman
and</p>
<p>sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in
their rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generous tear for
the fate of Charles I and the Earl of Strafford; and after the first</p>
<p>ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more
mortifying,</p>
<p>the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me that in
a</p>
<p>twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it . 142</p>

<p>He was so discouraged that for a time he thought of moving, as in his
youth, to some provincial town in France, where he could live under an
assumed name. However, France and England were at war, and Volume II was
nearly finished; he resolved to persevere. His prejudice grew from being
opposed; in revising Volume I he mad e “above a hundred altera - tions,”
but, he tells us with all the puckish delight of a mountainous imp, “I
have made all of them invariably to the Tory side.” 143 Nevertheless the
succeeding volumes had a good sale; the Tories now hailed him as their
stout defender, and some Whigs admitted the charm of a style simple,
clear, incisive, and direct, sometimes anticipating Gibbon’s judicial
dignity. The account of the dramatic conflict between Henry II and
Thomas a Becket rivals Gibbon’s narrative of the capture of
Constantinople by the Turks. The cumulative impression made by the six
volumes raised Hume’s fame to its peak. In 1762 Boswell rated him as
“the greatest writer in Britain” 144 — but Boswell was a Scot. In 1764
Voltaire modestly pronounced the book “perhaps the best history ever
written in any language.” 145 Gibbon and Macaulay have thrown it into
the shade, and Macaulay has balanced its prejudice. We are not advised
to read Hume’s History of England today; its record of the facts has
long since been improved upon; but one reader, who began it as a task,
found it an illumination and a delight.</p>
<p>7 . The Old Philosopher</p>
<p>In 1 7 5 5 a movement was begun by some Scottish divines to indict
Hume before the General Assembly of the Kirk on a charge of infidelity.
Mean- while the “Scottish Enlightenment” had generated a liberal
movement</p>
<p>He had long since admired French intellect, had been influenced by
the earlier writers of the French Illumination, and had corresponded
with Montesquieu and Voltaire. His works had received far more praise in
France than in England. The Comtesse de Boufflers fell in love with him
through print, wrote ingratiatingly to him, came to London to see him;
he escaped her. But when he reached Paris she took him in tow, made him
the lion of her salon, and struggled to arouse a manly passion in his
breast; she found him too stabilized for amours. He was feted in one
gathering after another; “no feast is complete without him,” said Mme.
d’Epinay. The aris - tocracy opened its arms to him; great ladies — even
the ailing Pompadour —</p>

<p>RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>r 59</p>
<p>fluttered about him. “I am convinced,” he wrote, “that Louis XIV
never, in any three weeks of his life, suffered so much flattery.” He
met Turgot, d’Alembert, d’Holbach, and Diderot; and Voltaire, from his
distant throne</p>
<p>In Nove mber, 1765, a new British ambassador came, and Hume’s ap -
pointment ended. He returned to Edinburgh, but in 1767 he accepted the
post of undersecretary at the Foreign Office in London. It was in this
pe- riod that he brought Rousseau into England, and had famous trouble
with him there; this story must wait. In August, 1769, aged fifty-eight,
he re- tired finally to Edinburgh, being now “very opulent (for I
possessed a reve - nue of £ 1 ,000 a year), healthy, and though somewhat
stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease, and of
seeing the increase of my reputation.” 148</p>
<p>His home on St. David Street became a salon, with Adam Smith, Wil-
liam Robertson, and other Scottish celebrities gathering about him as
their acknowledged sovereign. They liked him not only for his mind. They
saw that despite his iconoclastic reasoning he was amiable in discourse,
cheerful of mood, moderate in controversy, tolerant of contrary views,
not letting diversity of ideas abate the cordiality of his friendships.
He seems (like Montaigne and Voltaire) to have valued friendship above
love; “friendship is the chief joy of human life.” 149 Yet he was
popular with women, perhaps because he had no wife. He was a favorite
guest in many homes; if his cor- pulence ruined the chairs, 150 his wit
atoned for his weight. He suggested a tax on obesity, but expected that
some “divines might pretend that the Church was in danger”; he blessed
the memory of Julius Ca esar for having preferred fat men. “Upon the
whole,” said Adam Smith, “I have always considered him … as approaching
as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps
the nature of human frailty will admit.” 151</p>
<p>If one must seek flaws in so amiable a character, or blind spots in
so bril- liant a mind, the hardest to forgive are the references to the
“hideous hy - pothesis” of the “atheist” Spinoza, 152 which must have
aimed at protective</p>
<p>160 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>discoloration. Hume’s psychology was the most penetrating of his
time, but it did not quite account for the sense of personal identity;
one mental state does not merely recall another, it may recall it as
mine. The replace- ment of “cause” with “regular sequence” has required
only a change of phrase; “regular sequence” is enough for science and
philosophy; and the History of England still seeks to explain events by
causes. 153 A skepticism that confessedly is abandoned in actual life
must be wrong in theory, for practice is the final test of theory. And
it is strange that while reducing cause to custom, and morality to
sympathetic feeling, Hume gave so little weight to custom and feeling in
his interpretation of religion, and showed such lack of sympathy for the
persistent functions of religion in history. He was quite insensitive to
the consolations of faith, the comfort it brought to souls shivering in
the immensity of mystery, or the loneliness of grief, or the harsh
fatality of defeat. The su ccess of Wesley was history’s answer to
Hume.</p>
<p>Despite these cavils, we acknowledge again the cutting edge of Hume’s
catalytic mind. He was in himself the Enlightenment for the British
Isles; there, except in political vision, he was essentially all that a
dozen philoso- phies were for France. While feeling French influence
deeply, he came to the ideas of the Enlightenment, and struck some of
its most telling blows, before the philosophes — twt n before Voltaire —
had bared their fangs against hinfame; they owed as much to him as he to
them. “I salute you,” wrote - lenging the capacity of reason to defend
even the simplest fundamentals of religious faith; he carried the war
not merely to the walls but to the citadel of the ancient creed. Gibbon
was the offspring of Hume in philosophy, and his transcending disciple
in history. In Germany the Etiquiry concerning the Human Understanding
wok e Kant from his “dogmatic slumber” by apparently undermining all
science, metaphysics, and theology through questioning the objectivity
of cause. After reading the manuscript of Ha- mann’s translation of the
Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, Kant i n- corporated in the final
preparation of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) Hume’s criticisms of
the argument from design, and accounted them un - answerable. 155</p>
<p>“May it be my fate, for my own sake and for that of all my
friends,”</p>
<p>Hume wrote, “to st op short at the threshold of old age, and not to
enter too far into that dismal region.” 156 Fate took him at his word.
Says his autobiography:</p>
<p>In the spring of 1775 I was struck with a disorder in my bowels,</p>
<p>which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it,
become</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY l6l</p>
<p>mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have
suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange,
have, notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a
moment’s abatement of my spirits; insomuch that were I to name the
period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I</p>
<p>might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same
ardor as ever in my study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider,
be- sides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years
of</p>
<p>infirmities. 157</p>
<p>Diarrhea, the favorite vengeance of the gods upon the human great,
con- spired with internal hemorrhages to reduce him seventy pounds in
that one year 1775. To the Comtesse de Boufflers he wrote: “I see death
approach - ing gradually, without anxiety or regret. I salute you, with’
great affection and regard, for the last time.” 158 He went to ta ke the
waters at Bath, but they proved useless against chronic ulcerated
colitis. His mind remained calm and clear.</p>
<p>He returned to Edinburgh July 4, 177 6, prepared to die “as fast as
my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily and cheerfully as
my best friends could desire.” 159 When he read, in Lucan’s Dialogues of
the Dead , the various excuses that the dying gave to Charon for not
promptly boarding his boat to cross the Styx into eternity, he remarked
that he could not find any excuse fit to his own case, except perhaps to
plead: “Have a little pa - tience, good Charon. … I have been
endeavoring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years
longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of
the prevailing systems of superstition.” But Charon answered: “You
loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years. Do you
fancy that I will grant you a lease for so long a term? Get into the
boat this instant!” 160</p>
<p>Boswell, importunate and impertinent, insisted on putting the dying
man to the question — did he not now believe in another life? Hume
replied, “It is a most unreasonable fancy that we should exist forever.”
But, persisted Boswell, surely the thought of a future state is
pleasing? “Not at all,” an - swered Hume; “it is a very gloomy thought.”
Women came and begged him to believe; he diverted them with humor.
