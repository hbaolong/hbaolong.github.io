<h4 id="chapter-xii">CHAPTER XII</h4>
<p>The Golden Age of Spanish Art*</p>
<p>1556 — 1682</p>
<p>/. ARS UNA, SPECIES MILLE</p>
<p>H OW shall we explain that in this period, when Spain lost command of
the seas to England and of the land to France, and when all her</p>
<p>material enterprises seemed to collapse in failure and bankruptcy,
she could build the cathedral of Segovia, guide the sculpture of
Hernandez and Montanes, and inspire the painting of El Greco, Zurbaran,
Velazquez, and Murillo? Was it because the Spanish Church was still
rich, the Spanish court was still extravagant, American gold still
entered Seville, and Spanish artists, nourished by faith and fees, still
felt the glow of a glory not yet quite gone?</p>
<p>The splendor was least in architecture, for there the triumphs of the
past met all the needs of piety. At Seville the Church certified its
victory over the Moors by topping a Moslem minaret with a Christian
belfry that perfected the grace of the Giralda (1567); and a year later
Bartolome Morel crowned the whole with a figure of La Fe (Faith),
weighing a ton, yet so lightly poised that it turns with every breath of
wind to survey its worshipful domain. At Valladolid Juan de Herrera,
architect of the Escorial, began in 1585 the austere Cathedral of the
Assumption, on so vast a scale that it is still unfurnished. On a hill
dominating Segovia two centuries of architects and craftsmen began in
1522 the monumental cathedral that proudly symbolizes the dominant and
immovable devotion of Spain. At Salamanca Juan Gomez de Mora designed
for the Jesuits, in Palladian Doric plus dome, the immense Seminario
Conciliar (1617-1755).</p>
<p>But even Spain was becoming secular, and palaces as well as churches
were calling for art. At Aranjuez Philip II built (1575) a summer
residence whose cool gardens could rescue him from the heat and
solemnity of the Escorial. Philip III, as a center for his haunts, added
the Palace of El Pardo, whose ornate Hall of Ambassadors is famous for
its chandeliers. Philip IV and Olivares almost anticipated Versailles by
building at the eastern gate of Madrid a pleasure garden, Buen Retiro
(1631-33); in its court theater many plays of Lope and Calderon were
staged. Stately town halls — ayuntamientos — were raised in this age at
Leon and Astorga; and one at Toledo was designed by El Greco.</p>
<p>• All Spanish pictures mentioned in this chapter are in the Prado un
less otherwise stated.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 315</p>
<p>Sculpture was almost wholly ecclesiastical in form and mood. The
Gothic style was modified by Italian influence and baroque ornament, but
the portrait bust so popular in Italy was discountenanced in Spain with
an almost Moham- medan taboo. Painters — even masters like Zurbaran and
Murillo — ^lent their art to make sculpture impress the worshiper with
the realism of crucifixions and martyrdoms; nearly all statues were in
polychrome wood. Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, the erudite Scot who so
loved and annaled Spanish art, thought Juan de Juni “the best sculptor
of Spain.”^ Juan earned his renown by an altar in the Church of Nuestra
Senora de la Antigua at Valladolid and, in another church there, the
Mater DolorosUy a statue so cherished by the people that, in the
pathetic depth of their faith, they pleaded to be allowed to clothe it
in costly raiment. Spain usually ranks still higher Gregorio Hernandez;
h^ too carved at Valladolid a Mater Dolorosa; with characteristic
realism he painted bloodstains on her robe and set tears of glass into
her face; this Sorrowful Mother^ with the dead Christ lying in her lap,
may be the supreme work of Spanish sculpture in this age.</p>
<p>The greatest of these sculptors was Juan Martinez Montanes. He was
only eighteen when he and his wife came (1582) to the A 4 onastery of
Duke Nombre de Jesus at Seville, presented to it a figure of the Virgin,
and re- ceived in grateful exchange free residence there for life. He
pleased the Jesuits with statues of Ignatius and Xavier, and delighted
the Hieronymite monks with his St, Jerome, The cathedral of Seville
still shows his CrucifiXy ranked by one historian of art as “perhaps the
supreme render ing of the divine Vic- tim.”2 When Pope Paul V,
responding to popular demand, made belief in the Immaculate Conception
obligatory on all Catholics, Spain was especially happy since, like
France, it had concentrated its piety upon the Virgin. Alontanes rose to
the occasion by carving his chef- d’oeuvre (now in the Seville
cathedral) — the young Mother of God meditating on the mystery of her
freedom from original sin; this too has been ranked among the
masterpieces of the world’? sculpture,^ but the Andalusian maiden seems
too calm and satisfied, though weighed down with drapery.</p>
<p>The picture of Spanish art, to be fair in spite of brevity, would
have to enumerate and celebrate its minor glories: the gratings,
screens, and gates in iron or bronze; the woodwork on many a reredos,
and such choir stalls as those carved by Pedro de Mena for the cathedral
of Malaga; the lamps, crosses, chalices, pyxes and tabernacles wrought
in silver or gold, like the world-famous custodias of Juan de Arfe; the
figurines in wood, ivory, alabaster, or bronze; the embroideries and
brocades that graced altars and women; the enameled glass of Barcelona,
and Talavera’s tin -glazed wares.</p>
<p>In painting, before Velazquez, the Church was almost the sole patron
and arbiter. The somber passion of Spanish theology and piety,
reflecting, perhaps, the gloomy crags and the burning heat of the
terrain, allowed little humor, lightness, or elegance in treating
themes, banished the nude, frowned upon portraits and landscapes, and
encouraged a harsh realism that stressed the frightening rather than the
comforting phases of the faith; pictures were to instill the creed and
burn it into the soul with flaming imagery and monastic</p>
<p>3i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>severity. At last the painters themselves saw visions and claimed
divine in- spiration. Philip II rivaled the Church as a patron of
painters, but the subjects remained religious; when nobles commissioned
paintings they usually obeyed the same rule; only with Velazquez and
Philip IV did secularization begin. Some foreign influences entered to
modify this ecclesiastical influence. Carducci and Zuccaro and some
eighteen other Italians brought a softer mood into Spanish art; Anthonis
Mor came from Flanders in 1572; Spanish painters visiting the Low
Countries were touched by the spirit of Vandyck; and the exuberant
Rubens himself, sweeping down upon Madrid in 1603, begged the native
artists to look at life rather than death.</p>
<p>Besides the four masters who dominated Hispanic painting in this age
there were many of milder fire: Alonso Sanchez Coello, who made
portraits, in Flemish style, of Philip IPs Infante Don Carlos and
Infanta Isabel; Coello’s pupil Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, who left us a
somber Felipe IF and a powerful St. Augustine; Francisco de Ribalta,
whose tenebroso style of light surrounded by darkness appears in The
Sick St. Francis Comforted by an Angel; and Francisco Pacheco, who
taught Velazquez, gave him a daughter in marriage, and expounded the
principles of Spanish painting in his Arte de la pintura (1649). “The
chief end of art,” he wrote, “is to persuade men to piety and incline
them to God.”® In 1611 he visited El Greco in Toledo and condemned the
Greek’s pict ures as crueles borrones — trough sketches.® Let us
see.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>EL GRECO: 1548.^-1614</li>
</ol>
<p>In Crete, where he was born, he called himself Kyriakos
Theotokopoulos — i.e., the Lord’s divine son; in Italy he was called
Domenico Teotocopulo; in Spain Domingo Teotocopuli; he signed himself,
in Greek letters,</p>
<p>Domenikos Theotokopoulos; time has shortened him to El Greco, the
nickname given him in Spain. AVe know nothing of his life in Crete. His
ancestors may have emigrated to Crete from Constantinople after the
Moslem conquest of that Greek city (1453); in any case he could feel in
Crete, as later in Venice, the austere influence of Byzantine mosaics.
In his day Crete belonged to Venice; not unnaturally the young artist,
hearing of painting’s heyday there, took ship in excited hopefulness to
the lagoons, and probably joined the large colony of Greeks in that
cosmopolitan capital. He studied under Titian for two or more years,
admired Tinto- retto’s art of grouping figures in a crowded picture, and
may have caught Veronese’s flair for rich and colorful robes. He copied
famous paintings with patient humility in Venice, Reggio Emilia, Parma,
and Florence, and he arrived in Rome not long afte r Michelangelo’s
death (1564).</p>
<p>The first definite notice we have of him is in a letter written at
Rome November 16, 1570, by Giulio Clovio to Cardinal Alessandro
Farnese:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 317</p>
<p>There has arrived in Rome a young man from Candia, a pupil of</p>
<p>Titian, who is, I think, a painter of rare talent. . . . He has
painted</p>
<p>a portrait of himself which is admired by all the painters in Rome.
I</p>
<p>should like him to be under the patronage of your revered lordship,
without any other contribution to his living than a room in the</p>
<p>Famese Palace.’’</p>
<p>The Cardinal consented, and El Greco rewarded Clovio with a masterly
portrait.® When talk arose about the nudes in Michelangelo’s Last Judg -
ment, Domenico offered, if the whole picture were taken down, to replace
it with another just as good and better clothed.® His standing with
Roman artists fell. Some Spanish prelates in Rome told him that Philip
II was look- ing for painters to decorate the Escorial. In 1572 he moved
to Spain, shak- ing the dust of Rome from his shoes, but taking on his
brush something of the distortions of Italian mannerism.</p>
<p>We have no record of him thereafter till 1 575, when we find him both
de- signing and adorning the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in
Toledo, the ecclesiastical capital of Spain. For its altar he painted
the magnificent Assumption of the Virgin that now holds so prominent a
place in the Chicago Art Institute — partly modeled on Titian’s As
sunzione in the Frari at Venice, and still in the Italian style of
healthy youthful forms and</p>
<p>majestic old heads. For the cathedral at Toledo he painted (1577) a
famous Espolio de las vestiduras del Senor — despoiling of the garments
of the Lord. A commission appointed to judge the picture complained that
the tunic of Jesus was too glaringly red, and that the women at the
lower left — the three Marys — were out of place there, since the
Scriptures said they had looked on from afar; nevertheless the judges
prophetically pronounced the paint- ing “inestimable, so great is its
value.”‘® One of the Marys was the painter’s mistress. Dona Jeronima de
las Cuevas, whose sad and lovely face appears in most of El Greco’s
Virgins. Despite his loyalty to her a nd the Church he never married
her; this was not an old Spanish custom, but one long sanctified in
artists’ studios.</p>
<p>A writer of the next generation, Jose Martinez, described Domenico as
already confident of immortality:</p>
<p>He settled in . . . Toledo, introducing such an extravagant style</p>
<p>that to this day nothing has been seen to equal it; attempting to
discuss it would confuse the soundest minds. . . . He gave it to be
understood that there was nothing superior to his works. . . . His
nature was ex- travagant like his painting. … He used to say no price
was high</p>
<p>enough for his works, and so he gave them in pledge to their owners,
who willingly advanced him what he asked for them. . . . He was a</p>
<p>famous architect, and very eloquent in his speeches. He had few
dis-</p>
<p>3i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XU</p>
<p>ciples, as no one cared to follow his capricious and extravagant
style, which was only suitable to himself.’^</p>
<p>Toward 1580 Philip II sent for El Greco and asked him to paint
St.</p>
<p>Maurice and the Theban Legion. After four years of labor the artist
pre- sented the result to the King. Philip found the grouping of the
figures too confused; the picture was paid for but not accepted, and El
Greco returned grieving to Toledo, which, so far as we know, he never
left again. It was just as well, for now he was free to be his mystic
self.</p>
<p>As if in revenge, he painted for the Church of Santo Tome (1586) his
most famous picture, one of the high points of pictorial art. The
contract stipulated that he should show the clergy commemorating the
tradition that saints had descended from heaven to bury Don Gonzalo
Ruiz, Count Orgaz; St. Stephen and St. Augustine (in episcopal
vestments) were to be shown lowering the body to the tomb, amid a
reverent assemblage of notables; and over these figures the heavens,
opening, were to reveal the Son of God in glory. All this was done to
the letter, and much more, for almost every head is a finished portrait,
the robes are a marvel of gold and green and white, the demascened armor
of the Count gleams with light; and, for good measure, behind
St. Stephen may be seen El Greco himself. The masterpiece of this
masterpiece is the bearded, mitered head of St. Augustine. Or should we
prefer the handsome corpse? Or the lovely face of St. Stephen? Or the
bald priest reading the burial service? Or El Greco’s eight-year-old son
Jorge Manuel proudly holding a torch and letting a handkerchief emerge
from his pocket to display El Greco’s signature? In Francisco de Pisa’s
History of Toledo (1612) we read what we should have surmised: this
Burial of Count Orgaz “is one of the very finest</p>
<ul>
<li>paintings〕 in all Spain. Men come from foreign lands to see it,
with</li>
</ul>
<p>especial admiration; and the people of Toledo, far from tiring of it,
con- tinually find in it new matter to gaze at. In it may be seen,
realistically portrayed, many of the illustrious men of our time.”^**
However, the parish council haggled over the fee; the hot-tempered Greek
took the matter to court, won his case, and received two thousand
crowns.</p>
<p>He had no dearth of commissions now. He had found himself; he no
longer thought of Titian or Tintoretto; and he could experiment with the
elongation of forms, not because he suffered any defect of eyesight, but
probably because he felt that he might in this way symbolize the
spiritual exaltation of his figures — bodies stretched out by
heaven-seeking souls. In the St. Andrew and St. Francis of the Prado
this emaciation seems unintelligible unless we consider such symbolism,
and recall Gothic statu- ary slenderized for architectural limitations.
All is forgiven when we come to the St. Ildefonso painted for the
Caridad Hospital at Illescas; here in</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 319</p>
<p>the reverend spirit, the absorbed mind, the ascetic face, the thin
white hairs, and the delicate hands of the medieval a rchbishop is one
of El Greco’s profoundest conceptions. “This one picture would repay the
journey to Spain.”’*</p>
<p>We do not gather, from the little we know about El Greco’s life, that
he was Hispanically pious; he seems to have inclined to pleasure rather
than sanctity. When he painted The Holy Family for the Tavera Hospital
he endowed the Virgin with sensual beauty, not maternal dedication. The
Crucifixion is anatomically erudite but emotionally cold; Griinewald
felt that tragedy far more deeply. In his religious pictures El Greco is
at his best in the incidental portraits — as of himself, with white
beard and bald head, in The Pentecost. In a city crowded with
ecclesiastics he had no difficulty in getting powerful personalities to
sit for him; his friend the Trinitarian Paravicino (Boston), with a face
half scholar, half Inquisitor; or the Grand Inquisitor himself. Cardinal
Nino de Guevara (New York) — not quite as good as Velazquez’ imitation
portrait of Innocent X. El Greco himself surpassed it in The Cardinal of
Tavera, whose gaunt face, all bones and somber eyes, express again the
artist’s conception of ecclesiastical consecration. But the best of all
the portraits are of the brothers Covar- rubias: one, Antonio, secular,
grizzled, disillusioned, weary, forgiving; the other, Diego, in priestly
garb, but looking much more worldly, more humorous, quite well adjusted.
Only a few Rembrandts and Titians, and Raphael’s Julius II, excel these
profound studies.</p>
<p>They are among the treasures gathered in the Casa del Greco Museum at
Toledo. There, too, is the Plan of Toledo, in which the artist surveys,
as from a cloud, the whole city and its encompassing hills. He
represented it again, late in his life, in the View of Toledo under
stormy skies (New York) — an impressionist picture utterly disdaining
realist accuracy. By 1600 “the Greek” had become one of the town’s most
famous citizens, known to all for his proud and capricious spirit, a
mystic with a taste for money, occupying twenty-four rooms in an old
palace, hiring musicians to play for him at his meals, gathering about
him the intellectuals of Toledo, and honored as an “eminent
philosopher.”’* About 1605 he painted what is presumed to be his
self-portrait (New York) — bald, gray, almost hag- gard. In 16 1 1
Pacheco found him too weak to walk. Though he still kept his twenty-four
rooms, he could not pay his debts; the city council re- peatedly voted
him substantial sums. He died in 1614, aged seventy-three.</p>
<p>His standing in the world of art has been a posthumous adventure.</p>
<p>Gongora wrote a sonnet eulogy, and Velazquez recognized his genius,
but his strange art inspired no imitation, founded no school. By 1650 he
was lost in the glare of Velazquez’ fame. F or two centuries he was
almost for- gotten. Then Delacroix rediscovered him, Degas, A’lanet, and
Cezanne took</p>
<p>320</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>a lead from his rendering of moods; van Gogh and Gauguin saw in him
their own progenitor. In 1907 Julius Meier- Graefe’s Spanish Journey
raised El Greco far above Velazquez to the highest place in Spanish
painting. Such oscillations of fame are precarious, being subject to
“the wild vicis - situdes of taste.”^® But El Gre co will remain for
many centuries to come a stimulating example of an artist who reached
beyond objects to ideas and feelings, and beyond bodies to souls.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ZURBARAN: I598-1664</li>
</ol>
<p>After El Greco, for a generation, Spanish painting marked time with
lesser men, who did their best and disappeared. Then, almost
simultaneously, Fran- cisco de Zurbaran and Diego Velazquez flooded
Spain with great art. During thirty years these two served as
complements to each other: Zurbaran paint- ing like a monk frightened
into adoration and near to God, Velazquez pros- pering in the world and
close to his King.</p>
<p>Zurbaran was baptized at Fuente de Cantos, in southwestern Spain,
Novem- ber 7, 1598, son of a shopkeeper successful enough to send him to
develop his talent in Seville. After two years of study he signed his
first dated picture (1616), an Immaculate Conception which should have
ruined his career. A year later he moved to Llerema, fifteen miles from
his birthplace. The neighborhood was dotted with convents, churches, and
hermitages, from which Francisco took his modest commissions and his
inspirations. There he married Marfa Perez, nine years his senior, in
order to legitimize his child; she died after giving him two more. In
1625 he married a widow ten years his senior, but with a charming dowry;
by her he had six children, of whom five died in childhood. After her
death he married a prosperous widow; she gave him six children, of whom
five died in childhood. Love labored to keep a step ahead of death.</p>
<p>In art his creative period began v/ith a contract to paint, in six
months, twenty-one pictures for the Dominican Monastery of San Pablo el
Real at Seville (1626). Having completed this assignment, Zurbaran
appears to have visited Madrid and felt the influence of Velazquez.
Heretofore his paintings had reflected the dark and massive style of
Caravaggio, and perhaps of Ribera; now he added to his rugged naturalism
a new subtlety of shadows and a refinement of finish. Soon thereafter we
find him in Seville, painting twenty-two immense canvases for the
Mercedarian monks — the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, devoted to ransoming
captive Christians. The four pictures that remain from this group are
not masterpieces; but memorable is a boyish face in one of them, perhaps
the artist’s son Juan. Seville must have liked these paintings, for in
1629 it officially asked Francisco to make his home there — “Seville
would be honored . . . considering that the art of painting is one of
the major embellishments of the state.”^® Zurbaran consented.</p>
<p>In 1630, for the Franciscan Church of San Buenaventura, he painted
some</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART</p>
<p>321</p>
<p>of his greatest works. One is St Bonaventura Pointing St. Thomas
Aquinas to the Crucifix: the great theologian — ^unfortunately a
Dominican — ^is gently admonished that religion consists not in
philosophical theory but in the con- templation of Christ. This — the
theme picture of Zurbaran’s art — ^was stolen from Spain by Marshal
Soult (1810), found its way into the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin,
and was destroyed in the Second World War. Another in the series,
St. Bonaventura on His Bier, also taken by Soult, was sold to the Louvre
in 1858 and is still there; the four figures at the left are masterly.
Still finer is The Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas, which Zurbaran
painted for a Dominican college in Seville; the mind passes in
astonishment from one pro- found face to another — Ambrose, Gregory,
Jerome, Augustine, Charles V. However, Jeronimo Velazquez was paid six
times as much for the frame as Zurbaran for the picture.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Carmelite Church of San Alberto (1630), the busy
painter showed St. Francis absorbed in humble devotion, and St. Peter
Thomas, a monk wrinkled and haggard with waiting for Paradise. Returning
to the Mercedarian monastery (1631), he painted some of its most revered
monks; among these portraits is the magnificent Fray Pedro Machado. The
year 1633 was hectic with commissions: twelve Apostles for a church in
Lisbon, three pictures for the Carthusians at Seville, and ten for the
Chapel of St. Peter in the great cathedral; one of these, St. Peter
Repentant, still in its original place, is a striking essay in realism,
perhaps remembering Ribera.</p>
<p>Zurbaran was now in such wide demand that he delegated much of his
work to his aides. For the Monastery of Guadalupe in Estremadura he
painted The Temptation of St. Jerome, in which the head and the hands of
the saint are technical wonders, and the gentle ladies playing music
hardly de- serve to have their temptations resisted. Even from Peru and
Guatemala orders came; one series of Apostles went to Lima, another to
Antigua; and to Mexico City went Christ at Emmaus, picturing the risen
Christ as a hale and happy peasant at a meal. Some of these canvases
were done in haste or by proxy, and Zurbaran had to sue Lima for his
fee.</p>
<p>From 1645 his ascendancy at Seville was challenged by the young
Murillo, who supplied churches and convents with such tender
illustrations of the Chris- tian story that the demand for Zurbaran’s
disconcerting realism sharply de - clined. The older artist tried to
soften his terrors, and for a time he strove to rival Murillo in pious
and domestic sentiment, as in The Virgin and Child with St. John (now in
San Diego, California); but this new style was uncon- genial to his art
and mood. He moved to Aiadrid (1658) to repair his fortunes, but Philip
IV, himself penniless, found nothing better for him to do than to
decorate a hunting lodge. Velazquez was kind to him, but suddenly Velaz-
quez died. Zurbaran outlived his friend and his fame.</p>
<p>His reputation hardly surmounted the Pyrenees un til Napoleon’s
generals took a fancy to Zurbaran’s monumental monks and somber saints
and kidnaped some of them to France. When the Spanish monasteries were
secularized in 1835 iTiore of his work came to Paris, and in 1838 King
Louis Philippe opened in the Louvre a Spanish Gallery with four hundred
paintings, of which eighty</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>were ascribed to Zurbaran. Our present taste finds his range too
narrow and monastic, his spirit too gloomy and entranced. We miss in him
the ragamuffins of Murillo and the philosophers and pretty princesses of
Velazquez. And yet there is in his work a solid sincerity, a depth of
dedication, a power of color and form, that lift him beyond the realm of
transient preferences and ensure his place in the remembrance of
men.</p>

<p>His paternal grandfather was a Portuguese noble who, all fortune
lost, moved with his wife from Oporto to Seville. To their son Juan de
Silva and to Dona Jeronima Velazquez the artist was born, in the same
year as Vandyck, one year after Zurbaran and Bernini, eighteen before
Murillo. He was named Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez; usually he
called himself by his mother’s name, a practice common in southern
Spain. He received a good education, learned some Latin and philosophy,
and for a while tried science; then he turned to painting, studied
briefly with Juan de Herrera, longer with Pacheco. “I married him to my
daughter,” Pacheco</p>
<p>Velazquez set up his own studio, and soon attracted attention by his
predilection for profane subjects. He mingled with the lowly, and de-
lighted to put their thoughts and biographies into their faces. When he
was still a lad of twenty he painted a great picture. The Water Carrier
of Seville-^^ here, in rags and patience, is the dignity of honest
poverty. And at twenty-three he portrayed with already mature insight
the poet</p>
<p>Gongora (Boston) — eyes and nose piercing the world.</p>
<p>Presumably this was done during Velazquez’ first visit to Madrid
(1622). Seville and its ecclesiastics were too narrow a field for him;
some heat of ambition drove him to the capital, with his Water Carrier
under his arm. There he courted the court unsuccessfully, for Philip IV
and Olivares were busy with politics, marriages, and wars, and a dozen
other artists were climbing the same stairs. Diego returned to Seville.
A year passed; Prince Charles Stuart came to Madrid, wooed an infanta,
and showed a taste for art; now Olivares sent for Velazquez. The
black-eyed, black-haired youth rode up again to the capital, was made
court painter, and took the fancy of the King by picturing him as an
intrepid horseman on a prancing</p>
<p>charger. Philip not only posed for Velazquez a dozen times, but
encouraged the royal family (brothers, wives, children) and the court
(ministers, generals, poets, jesters, dwarfs) to take their turn before
that immortalizing brush. Diego was given a studio in the royal palace;
and there, or near it, he spent nearly all the remaining thirty-seven
years of his life. It was a magnificent opportunity and a narrowing
imprisonment.</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>Two major influences broadened him. Rubens, then the most famous
artist in the world, visited Madrid again in 1628 — a master of light
and shade, a reckless painter of pagan deities and voluptuous nudes;
Velazquez was stirred. Rubens advised him to go to Italy, especially to
Venice, and study those geniuses of coloring. Diego pleaded with Philip
and was granted conge and four hundred precious ducats for the trip. We
get a sample of maritime speeds in that age when we learn that Velazquez
left Barcelona August 10, 1629, and reached Genoa August 20. He crossed
Italy to Venice and sat for days before the great canvases of Tintoretto
and Veronese, the portraits and the mythologies of Titian. He passed on
to Ferrara and Rome, copied the ancient marbles in the Forum, and envied
the drawing in the frescoes of Michelangelo on the Sistine Chapel
ceiling. Those majestic forms helped Velazquez to pass from the dark
shadows of Caravaggio to a sharper rendering of figures in clear light.
Then he moved south to Naples to visit Ribera; and from Naples he sailed
back to Spain (January 1631).</p>
<p>Was it vanity — the sustaining shadow of every self — that prompted
Philip to sit so often for an artist of such penetrating vision and
meticulous veracity, or was it to give his portrait to soliciting
friends? Sad is the change from the fine tall youth of the early
pictures to the later revelations of color gone from the face and
painted into the hair, of somber autocracy persisting, through years and
defeats, in the cold blue eyes and the pre- hensile Hapsburg chin. If
there is something superficial in these royal portraits it may be
because there was nothing beneath the visible surface. When there was
something there, as in the portraits of Gongora and Olivares, it came
out on the canvas.</p>
<p>Between the King’s pictures came Queen Isabel, then Queen Mariana,
and Philip’s sister Queen Maria of Hungary, sitting to no great result.
Phili p’s younger brother, the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand, posed as
a</p>
<p>hunter, with a dog all muscle, nerve, and alert devotion. Olivares
mounted a black charger for his picture in the Prado, and a white
charger for the same pose in the painting in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art at New York, leaving no doubt as to who was in the saddle in Spain.
The most pleasing of these court portraits are those of the young Don
Baltasar Carlos, in whom all the hopes of the dynasty rested. Velazquez
painted this lovely child again and again, with transparent delight: in
1631 with an attendant dwarf in 1632 as already the charm of the
court;^® in 1634 as swinging a marshal’s baton and (aged five) proudl y
bestriding a tremendous horse; in 1635 as a hunter carefully grasping
his gun, but clearly too gentle to kill or rule; that guileless face
answers those who thought that Velazquez rendered only surfaces. And so
the series progressed, from Carlos’ seco nd to his sixteenth year, when
the beloved Prince fell into a fever and died.</p>
<p>The dwarf seen in one of these pictures was among several who gave
the</p>
<p>324 the age of reason begins (chap. XII</p>
<p>failures at Philip’s court a comforting sense of superiori ty and
magnitude. The custom had come down from Imperial Rome and the still
more</p>
<p>ancient East. Even the papal court had dwarfs; Cardinal Vitelli
collected forty-four to wait upon his guests. The first Duke of
Buckingham presented Queen Henrietta Maria with a pie that contained a
dwarf eighteen inches tall.^^ For their own satisfaction, and the
general amusement, Philip IV’s dwarfs were dressed in sumptuous raiment
flashing jewelry and gold. Velazquez painted them with sympathy and
humor: one, called Antonio el Ingles (the Englishman), proudly taller
than his dog, though not half so handsome; another, Sebastian de Morra,
scowling in his massive beard and clenching his fists against his fate.
There were jesters too at the court. Velazquez painted five of them;
one, whose portrait is called The Geog- rapher^^ because he points to a
globe, looks more rational than Olivares; a second, Barbarossa, draws a
ferocious sword; a third has dressed himself as Don Juan of Austria; a
fourth struggles with an enormous book; a fifth, portrayed in The Idiot,
is harmlessly, almost ingratiatingly insane.</p>
<p>Though always a courtier, and unmistakably a gentleman, Velazquez
found relief from protocol by studying the life of those stately
commoners who still adorn the Spanish scene. Early in his career (1629)
he persuaded two handsome youths and half a dozen peasants to pose for
Los borrachos (The Drinkers)’, a nearly naked Bacchus, sitting on a
barrel, crowns with vines a kneeling figure, while about them gather
rough devotees of the grape, some worn with work, some grizzled with
age; this is perhaps the only memorable bacchanal in Spanish art of the
Golden Century. Even more remarkable than these topers are the two
strange paintings that Velazquez labeled Aesopus, the portrait of an old
sad author, destitute and half blind, carrying his fables down the
years, and Menippus, that of a Cynic philosopher of the third century
b.c.; these are unforgettable faces. And not least in the world that
Velazquez has left us are the animals: horses that now seem to us
ungainly stout, but redeemed by proud heads and flashing eyes; a stag’s
head with philosophic countenance resigned to human ferocity; and dogs
on the qui vive for action or alertly asleep.</p>
<p>These were the byplays of Velazquez’ brush, perhaps a relief from the
perils of painting without compliment the dignitaries of the court. Our
estimate of the seventeenth-century Spaniards rises when we see these
nobles, unassumingly robed, yet confronting with proud faith a world in
which their beloved country seemed palsied with decay. Don Diego del
Corral y Arellano, Cardinal Caspar de Borja y Velasco,^® the sturdy
sculp- tor Montanes, the supercilious Knight of Santiago,^* the handsome
and diffident Francesco II d’Este,*® the magnificent, lordly Don Juan
Fran - cisco Pimental — these are portraits that reach the soul. And if
the For- trait of a Man in the Capitoline Gallery of Rome is really of
Velazquez</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 325</p>
<p>himself, it is impossible not to love him — the carelessly curly
hair, the modest dress, the soft and meditative eyes.</p>
<p>It is remarkable how, in Velazquez, the court crowded out the Church
and the hallowed religious themes. He could not rival El Greco or Zur-
baran in picturing wrinkled old Apostles and saints; only The Coronation
of the Virgin among his religious paintings evoked all his powers. He
was much happier in secular scenes. In Las lanzas, which we know better
as The Surrender of Breda, he spread himself out lavishly, making it one
of the largest (120 by 144 inches), but also one of the most detailed,
canvases in the history of art. In the long war of Spain against the
rebels in the Netherlands, Ambrosio de Spinola had recaptured for Spain
(1625) the strategic city of Breda, in northern Brabant. Velazquez had
met Spinola in 1629 on the voyage from Italy; he had been struck by the
knightly nobility of the great general; now he signalized this in a
masterpiece that showed the victorious Spanish lancers raising their
pikes aloft, the captured city burning, the defeated and surrendering
general, Justin of Nassau, offering the keys of the town to Spinola, and
the chivalrous victor complimenting the loser on the bravery of his
defense. In the striking contrasts of colors, and the individualization
of the attendant figures, Velazquez achieved a triumph, which Philip IV
was happy to display in the Palace of Buen</p>
<p>Retiro.</p>
<p>In 1649, as reward for twenty-six years of work, Philip financed</p>
<p>Velazquez’ second visit to Italy and commissioned the artist to
secure cast - ings of classic statuary and to purchase paintings by the
Italian masters. Velazquez found prices already awesome; hardly any
major work by the great Venetians could be bought at any price; for five
pictures he had to pay 12,000 crowns (50,000?). Were millionaires and
others already using art as a hedge against inflation?</p>
<p>The best painting done in Italy in t hat year 1650 was Velazquez’ por
- trait of Innocent X. When the Pope consented to sit for him the
artist, feeling out of practice, prepared his hand and eye by making a
portrait of his mulatto slave, Juan de Pareja.*^® This picture met with
universal ac- claim among the artists of Rome, who at once elected
Velazquez to their Academy of St. Luke. The Pope gave him only a few
sittings; Velazquez made preliminary studies of the head, and one of
these, in the National Gallery at Washington, is almost
indistinguishable from the finished por- trait that passed down as an
heirloom in the Doria family to which the Pope belonged; it was
preserved in the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, where</p>
<p>• Pare) a, after years of preparing Velazquez’ brushes, colors, and
palett es and watching his mind and work, secretly used the materials
himself, and finally painted so well that Philip IV, having mistaken one
of Pareja’s canvases for a Velazquez, freed him; neverthe - less Juan
remained as a scholar and servant in the artist’ s family till his own
death.27</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>Reynolds, viewing it, judged it “the most beautiful picture in
Rome.”^® Coming upon it there today, one feels in it a power, both of
character and of art, that places it alongside Raphael’s Julius II and
Titian’s Paul III,</p>
<p>among the most impressive portraits of all time. Innocent X was
seventy- six when he posed for this picture; he died five years later.
But for his pontifical dress and ring, one could mistake him for one of
the bandit leaders who had troubled so many popes; but then, studying
those hard and resolute features, we realize that Innocent was what he
had to be — a ruler governing a state of unruly Italians, a pontiff
guiding a Church of unchristian Christians reaching from Rome to the
Philippines, from Rome to Paraguay; he had to have iron in his blood,
steel in his eyes, mastery in his face; and Velazquez saw and placed
them there. Seeing the portrait, the Pope made one wry com ment: “Too
true!”®® Roman artists admired the compact composition, the striking
harmony of red, white, and gold, the suspicious, searching, sidelong
glance of the blue-gray eyes, the hands themselves announcing character.
When Vel^quez left Italy (June 1651), it was not as a pupil seeking old
masters, but as himself the acknowledged master of the age. For Rubens
now was dead, and no one dreamed that an obscure Dutchman, struggling
with debts and soon to retire to an Amster- dam ghetto, would rise from
the grave after centuries to challenge that supremacy.</p>
<p>Returning to Madrid, Velazquez made the outstanding blunder of his
life: he applied for, and obtained, appointment as aposentador del rey —
man- ager of the royal palace. Perhaps he was tired of painting, or felt
that he had reached the limit of his possibilities in that field. The
post was no sinecure; it involved personal supervision of the palace, of
its furniture and decoration, heating and sanitation; moreover, he was
expected to make arrangements for court plays, balls, and tournaments,
and to provide quarters for the court on royal tours. He had to
accompany the King on all major journeys, for pleasure or politics or
war. Could anything be more absurd for a man who had painted Innocent X?
The pride of place had sur- mounted, in Velazquez, the consciousness of
genius.</p>
<p>In the nine years that remained to him he gave to painting only such
time as could be spared from his official chores. He resumed the
portrayal of the royal family, of distinguished courtiers, and of the
King himself. He made three lovely pictures of the Infanta Margarita,
and painted her again as the center of one of his masterpieces. Las
meninas — The Maids of Honor-, servants, dwarf, and dog gather around
the Princess, and Velazquez him- self is seen in the background, putting
them all on canvas. He portrayed her again in the great blue skirt that
made her legs thenceforth a sacred and inscrutable mystery;®® and
shortly before his death he pictured her as a miracle of innocence in
lace. In 1657 he digressed from the court to paint</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 327</p>
<p>Las hilanderas — The Tapestry Weavers — magnificent figures caught in
the turmoil and dignity of work. In that same year he dared the Inquisi-
tion, and scandalized and delighted Spain, by painting the shapely back
and buttocks of The Rokeby Venus, so called from its long stay in the
home of an English family that bought it for £ 500 and sold it to the
Lon- don National Gallery for 45,000. A suffragette, angry at such an
exposure of trade secrets, slashed that rosy back in six places, but it
was sewed up again alluringly.</p>
<p>In Las meninas we see Velazquez as he saw himself in his final years
— hair abounding, proud mustache, slightly somber eyes. The mouth seems
sensual, yet we hear nothing, in his record, of those sexual diversions
and personal conflicts that use up so much of so many artists. He had a
high standing at the court for his fine manners, his sense of humor, his
decent family life. He has left us portraits of his wife Juana and his
daughter Francisca;®^ perhaps the subject of The Lady with the Faif^ is
again</p>
<p>Francisca. Her husband, Juan Bautista del Mazo, painted The Family of
the Artist, showing Velazquez, in a studio background, and five children
who helped to keep the family one.</p>
<p>His death resulted from his office. In the spring of 1660 he arranged
the complex ceremonies and festivities that were to accompany, on an
island in the boundary river Bidassoa, the signing of the Treaty of the
Pyrenees and the betrothal of the Infanta Maria Teresa to Louis XIV.
Velazquez had to provide for the transit of the court halfway across
Spain to San Sebastian, and for four thousand pack mules carrying
furniture, pic- tures, tapestry, and other decoration. The painter, now
lost in the official, returned to the capital “tired with traveling by
night and working by day,” as he reported to a friend. On July 3 1 he
was put to bed with tertian fever. On August 6, or, in the words of his
first biographer, “on the Feast of the</p>
<p>Those of us who do not know the technique of painting can only enjoy
Vel^quez’ works, not judging their quality, but letting them show us an
age, a court, a roi faineant, and a proud but gentle soul. Even so we
may relish the classic clarity, simplicity, dignity, and truth of these
pictures; we can surmise the labor and the skill that underlay their
triumphs, the tenta- tive sketches, the experimental distribution of
figures, the apposition, depth, and transparency of colors, the molding
play of light and shade. Critics, tired of hackneyed adulation, have
pointed out the defects of the Spanish master; minor faults like the
silly headdresses of his Infantas, the barrel bellies of his horses, the
disproportionate mirrored face in The Rokeby Venus-, and major blemishes
like his lack of emotion, imagination, idealism.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>or sentiment, his almost feminine absorption in personalities rather
than ideas, his apparent blindness to anything unseen by his eyes.®®
Even in Velazquez’ days one of his rivals, Vincenzo Carducci, accused
him of a myopic naturalism that mistook the conscientious representation
of ex- ternal reality as the highest function of pictorial art.</p>
<p>Who shall reply for Velazquez (who would never have replied) that</p>
<p>he was not responsible for those headdresses and those equine
bellies; that controlled emotion is more moving than emotion expressed;
that the por- traits of Baltasar Carlos and the princesses, the pictures
of the maids of honor, and The Surrender of Breda show a delicate
sentiment; that Aesopus and Menippus are studies in philosophy; that the
portraits of Gongora, Olivares, and Innocent X are not imitations of
surfaces but evocations of souls.^ There is no obvious pursuit of beauty
in Velazquez, but rather a quest for the revealing type; few females
smoothed with loveliness, but many men lined and charactered with
life.</p>
<p>Always honored in Spain as her greatest painter, Velazquez was hardly
known north of the Pyrenees — perhaps because so much of him was in the
Prado — until Raphael Mengs proclaimed him to Germany in 1761, and the
Napoleonic wars in Spain revealed him to England and France. Manet and
the Impressionists hailed him as their precursor in the study and rep-
resentation of light and atmosphere; and for half a century Velazquez
was ranked with the highest. Whistler called him “the painter’s
painter,” as the teacher of them all; Ruskin declared ex cathedra that
“everything that Velazquez does may be regarded as absolutely right.”
Then Meier -Graefe went to Spain to seek Velazquez in the Prado, found
El Greco in Toledo, and announced that Velazquez “stopped where El Greco
began,” and “always remained in the antechamber of art.”®* Suddenly half
the world believed Velazquez to be second-rate.</p>
<p>Fame is a fashion. W’e tire of wearing old admirations on our pens,
and find it ej^hilarating to discard worn idols from our fancy, to take
down the dead mighty from their seats, and to put on the praises of new
gods, blown up by our originality or exhumed by some fresh renown. There
is no telling how great Velazquez will seem when the vanes of taste veer
again.</p>
<p>V. MURILLO: 1 6 1 7-8 2</p>
<p>There was a time, in our believing youth, when Murillo’s Immaculate
Conception of the Vir^n stood as high in repute as Raphael’s Sistine</p>
<p>Madonna-, now none so poor to do it reverence. The decline of
Christian faith in Europe and America has taken half their beauty from
pictures that we thought inherently beautiful. Murillo is one victim of
that denudation.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 329</p>
<p>But first a courtesy to Alonso Cano. A strange’ man — spriest,
duelist, painter, sculptor, architect. Born in Granada, he migrated to
Seville, studied painting (beside Velazquez) with Pacheco and sculpture
with Montanes. He designed, carved, and painted retables for the College
of San Alberto and the Church of Santa Paula, where he competed
successfully against Zurbaran. For the church of Lebrija he carved
religious statuary that drew students from foreign lands to admire and
imitate. He fought a duel, severely wounded his adversary, fled to
Madrid, and won the protection of Olivares through the intercession of
Velazquez. His paintings in and near the capital earned him a court
appointment. In 1644 his wife was found murdered in bed; he accused his
servant, but was himself charged with the crime. Again he fled from
success; he hid in a remote monastery, was found, arrested, tortured;
bore all pains without admitting guilt; was freed, and began again. In
1651, aged fifty, he returned to Granada, where he be- came a priest and
a canon of the cathedral, and made for it statues, paintings, a lectern,
and a portal of such excellence that his arrogance found pardon.
Commissioned by the royal auditor in Granada to model a statue of
St. Anthony of Padua, he finished it to the -satisfaction of the
official, who, however, haggled about the price. Cano asked one hundred
doubloons (,200?). “How many days has it taken you?” the official asked.
“Twenty - five,” said Cano. “Then,” said the auditor, “you esteem your
labor at four doubloons a day?” “You are a bad accountant, for I have
been fifty years learning to make such a statue as this in twenty- five
days.” “And I have spent my youth and my patrimony on my university
studies, and now, being auditor of Granada, a far nobler profession than
yours, I earn each day a bare doubloon.” “Yours a nobler profession than
mine!” cried the sculptor. “Know that the King can make auditors of the
dust of the earth, but that God reserves to Himself the creation of an
Alonso Cano”; and at once, in fury, he smashed the statue to bits.®^ For
a time it was thought that the Inquisition would imprison him, but
Philip IV protected him, and Cano continued to paint pictures and carve
statues — nearly all religious — that moved admirers of his multiple
genius to call him the Michelangelo of Spain. He spent his earnings as
fast as they came, usually in charities, and grew old in such poverty
that the cathedral chapter had to vote funds for his relief. On his
deathbed he rejected the crucifix offered him, because, he said, it was
badly carved.</p>
<p>Bartolome Esteban Murillo was quite another man — modest, gentle,
pious, the idol of his pupils, the beloved of his competitors, the
cornucopia of charity. Seville, then the metropolis of Spanish art, saw
his birth in 1617, the last of fourteen children. He studied painting
under Juan de Castillo, but, as his parents died poor when he was
fourteen, the orphan earned his bread by painting coarse and hasty
pictures for a weekly fair. Hearing</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Xll</p>
<p>that Philip IV was kind to artists, he made his way to Madrid (?),
where, according to an uncertain tradition,*® Velazquez befriended him,
lodged him in his own home, secured his admission to the royal
galleries, and encouraged him to study the works of Ribera, Vandyck, and
Velazquez.</p>
<p>However, we find him in 1645 again at Seville. A Franciscan monastery
there had offered a resistible sum for seven large pictures; established
artists scorned the fee; Murillo agreed to it, and produced his first
masterpiece. The Angels’ Kitchen,^* showing angels coming from heaven,
bringing food, cooking it, laying tables, and feeding the pious in a
famine; Murillo, though he tried to follow the masculine style of Ribera
and Zurbaran, told the story with his own turn for tender sentiment.
This picture and The Death of Santa Clara*“ made the artist’s fame; half
of literate Seville came to admire, and commissions mounted. As these
were nearly all ecclesi- astical, Murillo poured out Virgins, Holy
Families, and saints in happy profusion, peopling the Christian legends
with such fair women, handsome men, charming gamins, rosy colors, and
mystic atmosphere that Catholic Europe warmed to him as the most lovable
expositor of the most lovable creed.</p>
<p>So fed, Murillo, aged thirty, ventured into marriage, filled his home
with the noise, quarrels, and delight of nine children, and labored for
them contentedly till his death. The cathedral chapter paid him ten
thousand reals for the St. Anthony of Fadm that still hangs there. A
story suspi- ciously recalling a legend told of Zeuxis,^* but printed
eleven years before Murillo’s death, assures us that birds flying into
the cathedral tried to perch on the lilies in the picture, and pecked at
the fruit.^*</p>
<p>Though his subjects were nearly all religious, he made them human</p>
<p>rather than ecclesiastical. If all Roman Catholic Europe took to its
heart the many copies he sent out of his Immaculate Conception of the
Virgin*“ it was not only because they celebrated a theme especially dear
to Spain and that age, but because it enthroned womanhood in a cloud of
idealism and sanctity. The lovely and modestly sensual women of
Andalusia in- spired The Madonna of the Rosary ** The Gypsy Madonna<em>“
and the darkly beautiful Holy Family with the Bird.</em>“</p>
<p>And who has painted children better? The Prado Annunciation shows us
a girl just entering her teens, diffident and delicate, the very chef-
d’ - oeuvre of life. For the many forms in which Murillo pictured Christ
as a child, he found models in the pretty children around him in his
home and his street; probably it was they who interested him, rather
than the set theme; and he painted them as charmingly as any bambini of
the Italian Renaissance. If he could not squeeze children into his
religious pictures he painted them independently. The Haus der Kunst in
Munich has a wall full of them: boys throwing dice, boys eating melons
as a bearable way of wash-</p>
<p>CHAP, xn) THE GOLDEN AGE OF SPANISH ART 33I</p>
<p>ing their faces, a boy munching bread while his mother picks lice
from his hair. A Boy Leaning out of a Window<em>“^ makes it plain that
money and hap- piness have quarreled and parted; let him be A Boy ’with
a Dog</em>^ and the world is his oyster. In the Beggar Boy of the Louvre
the idealist painter takes leave of the supernatural, looks at life on
earth, and finds it lovable even in rags. In his realism Murillo is
still the idealist.</p>
<p>He lived, as he painted, without tragedy, except at the very end.
Climb- ing a scaffold to finish a painting in a church at C 4 diz, he
lost his footing, fell, and ruptured himself so severely that poisoning
set in, and soon the favorite son of all Andalusia died (1682), so
suddenly that he could not complete his will. Over his tomb, by his
instructions, were inscribed his name, a skeleton, and two words, Vive
moriturus — “Live as though about to die.”</p>
<p>Through two centuries his reputation remained high for those who</p>
<p>cared more for what a picture said than for how it said it.
Napoleon’s gen - erals spread his fame by stealing his works and selling
them as legitimate loot. Incompetent copyists multiplied his paintings
and stirred criticism to question his art. He knew the technique of his
trade, but his range was too restricted by his success with the Church;
he lent himself too readily to the feminine and sentimental side of
life; and what began by being beauti- ful became, through stereotyped
repetition, unimpressively pretty. His saints looked up to heaven so
persistently that when Europe turned from heaven it lost sight of
Murillo. For the same reason it lost sight of Spanish painting in
general after 1680. While Europe debated Christianity, Spain clung to
her medieval heritage, and not till Goya would her art startle the world
again.</p>
<p>During Murillo’s life a hundred fatal factors ended the Century of
Gold. Gold itself, and its foreign quest, were factors: the youth and
vigor of Spain broke from the prison of the Peninsula to explore and
exploit the Americas; and the gold they sent back corrupted Spanish
life, encouraged sloth, raised prices, or fell into Dutch or Genoese
bottoms carrying Spanish trade. The government hoarded the precious
metals, debased the currency, expelled the productive Moriscos,
multiplied and sold offices, taxed every- thing to the point of economic
apathy, and squandered wealth in martial expeditions and court
extravagance while industry languished, unemploy- ment spread, commerce
dwindled, population shrank, and cities decayed. The narrowly
aristocratic government lost all dignity, put collection boxes in the
streets, and solicited money from door to door to finance its domestic
incompetence and its foreign defeats.^® Spanish armies garrisoning

<p>battle against the incredible pertinacity of the Netherlands, drained
away the human and material resources of a small, half-arid and
mountainous state shackled by its boundaries in a sea controlled by
commercial com- petitors and naval enemies. Only the monasteries and the
churches re- mained, clinging to their enormous, inalienable, untaxable
properties, and multiplying monks in costly idleness. While religion
appeased poverty with promissory notes on Paradise, stifled thought, and
invited Spain to live on its past, France and England rewarded industry,
captured com- merce, and entered the future. Adjustment to a changing
environment is the essence of life, and its price.</p>
