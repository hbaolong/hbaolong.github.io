<h4 id="chapter-xxviii-the-political-drama">CHAPTER XXVIII The Political
Drama</h4>
<p>1 7 5 6 — 9 2</p>
<p>I. THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE</p>
<p>T HE Industrial Revolution was the most basic process, the political
strug- gle was the most exciting drama, of the second half of the
eighteenth century in England. Now the giants of English oratory —
Chatham, Burke, Fox, and Sheridan — made the House of Commons the stage
of bitter and mo- mentous conflicts between Parliament and the king,
between Parliament and the people, between England and America, between
the conscience of Eng- land and the English rulers of India, and between
England and the French Revolution. The political structure was the frame
and machinery of the play. The government of Great Britain was a
constitutional monarchy in the sense that the king implicitly agreed to
rule according to existing laws and traditional usages, and to make no
new laws without the consent of Parlia- ment. The constitution was an
accumulation of precedents, not a document, with two exceptions. One was
the Magna Carta signed by King John in</p>
<ol start="1215" type="1">
<li>The other arose when the Westminster Convention in 1689, offering
the crown of England to William of Orange and Mary his wife, accompan-
ied the offer with an “Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Sub
- ject, and Settling the Succession of the Crown.” This “Bill of
Rights,” as brevity called it, asserted that the “power of suspending of
laws or the exe - cution of laws by r egal authority without consent of
Parliament is illegal”; that “levying money for or to the use of the
Crown, by pretense of preroga - tive, without grant of Parliament… is
illegal”; and it added: “Having</li>
</ol>
<p>herefore an entire confidence that… the Prince of Orange will…
preserve them [the Parliament] from the violation of their rights which
they have here asserted, and from all other attempts upon their
religion, rights and liberties, the… Lords Spiritual and Temporal and
Commons… do resolve that William and Mary, Prince and Princess of
Orange, be and be declared King and Queen of England, France and
Ireland.” In accepting the</p>
<p>684 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>absolute monarchs who made and unmade laws, England had a
constitutional government that was praised by philosophers and envied by
half the world.</p>
<p>The census of 1 80 1 1 estimated the population of Great Britain at
nine mil- lion souls, divided into the following classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>At the top, 287 temporal (secular) peers and peeresses, as heads
of families totaling some 7,175 persons. Within this class there were
ranks in descending order: princes of the [royal] blood, dukes,
marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons. These titles carried down
generation after generation to the eldest son.</p></li>
<li><p>Twenty-six bishops — the “spiritual lords.” These, with the 287
tem - poral lords, were entitled to sit in the House of Lords. Together
these 3 1 3 families constituted the nobility proper; to all of them
except dukes and princes the appellation “lord” could be properly
applied. A less formal and nontransmissible nobility could be acquired
by appointment to the higher offices in the administration, the army or
the navy; but usually these ap- pointments went to persons already
ennobled.</p></li>
<li><p>Some 540 baronets, and their wives, entitled to prefix “Sir” and
“Lady” to their Christian names, and to transmit these titles.</p></li>
<li><p>Some 350 knights, and their wives, entitled to the same prefixes,
but not to transmit them.</p></li>
<li><p>Some six thousand (e) squires — the “gentry,” or most numerous
class of landowners. The baronets, knights, and squires, and their
wives, consti- tuted the “lesser nobility,” and were generally included
with their superiors in the “aristocracy.”</p></li>
<li><p>Some twenty thousand “gentlemen” or “ladies” living on income
with - out manual work, having a coat of arms, and assumed to be of
“gentle” birth — i.e., born in the gens , or group of old and accepted
families.</p></li>
<li><p>Below all these came the remainder of the population: the lower
clergy, civil servants, businessmen, farmers, shopkeepers, artisans,
laborers, soldiers, and sailors; also some 1,040,000 “paupers” receiving
public relief, and about 222,000 “vagrants, gypsies, rogues, thieves,
swindlers, counterfeiters of base money, in or out of prison, and common
prostitutes.” 2</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The aristocracy, with only occasional resistance, dominated the
govern- ment by its wealth (the 287 peers received twenty-nine per cent
of the na- tional income in 1801 3 ), by its prominence in high civil or
military posts, by the prestige of ancient rank, and by its control of
parliamentary elections and legislation. Electorally, England was
divided into forty counties (rural districts) and 203 boroughs
(townships). Excluded from the franchise were women, paupers, convicted
criminals, Roman Catholics, Quakers, Jews, agnostics, and others who
could not swear allegiance to the authority and doc- trines of the
Church of England. In the counties only those Protestant land- owners
who paid forty shillings annual tax were entitled to vote for Parlia-
ment; these totaled about 160,000. As voting was public, very few voters
dared support any candidate other than the one nominated by the
principal landlords of the county; hence relatively few voters bothered
to vote, and many elections were decided by arrangement among the
leaders without any</p>

<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>685</p>
<p>balloting at all. The major landowners thought it only just that,
having so much at stake in the conduct of the government and the fate of
the nation, their representation in Parliament should be proportionate
to their property; and most of the lesser landlords agreed.</p>
<p>The boroughs displayed a confusing variety of electoral patterns. In
the city of Westminster (now central London) there were about nine
thousand voters; in the city of London as then constituted there were
six thousand; in Bristol, five thousand; only twenty-two boroughs had
more than a thou- sand. 4 In twelve boroughs all adult males could vote;
in most of the others only property holders; in several the candidates
were chosen by the municipal “corporation”— which has been defined as
“an urban oligarchy of attor - neys, merchants, brokers, and brewers
entrenched in a self-electing corpora- tion which had by royal charter
exclusive control over the town’s prop - erty.” 5 Some of these
corporations gave their vote to the candidate (s) whose sponsor (s) paid
the highest price. In 1761 the borough of Sudbury openly advertised its
vote for sale; and in the following election the corporation of Oxford
formally offered to re-elect its M.P.s if they would pay the corpora-
tion’s debts. 6 In some boroughs the privilege of choosing the candidate
be - longed by custom to specific individuals or families not
necessarily residing there; so Lord Camelford boasted that if he wished
he could elect his Negro butler to Parliament. 7 Such “pocket boroughs”
were sometimes sold like merchandise; Lord Egremont bought Midhurst for
^4o,ooo. 8 In some “rot - ten boroughs” a handful of voters could sen d
one or more representatives to Parliament, while the city of London
returned only four. Even when the franchise was almost universal the
election was usually determined by bri- bery, by violence, or by keeping
a refractory voter too intoxicated to vote. 9 By various means hi
“patrons” controlled the elections in 205 boroughs. 10 There were some
85,000 voters in the boroughs, 160,000 in the counties — 245,000 in
all.</p>
<p>From such varied elections came the 558 members of the House of Com-
mons in 1761. Scotland sent forty-five, the counties of England and
Wales ninety-four, the boroughs 415, the two universities two each. The
House of Lords then contained 224 peers, temporal or spiritual.
“Parliamentary privilege” included the right of P arliament to pass on
bills proposed for legis- lation; to levy taxes and thereby hold the
“power of the purse”; to judge the credentials of persons claiming
admission to it; to penalize — with impris- onment if it so wished — any
injury to its members or any disobedience to its rules; and to enjoy
full freedom of speech, including immunity from pun- ishment for words
uttered in Parliament.</p>
<p>The division of members into Tories or Whigs had by 1761 lost nearly
all significance; the real division was between supporters and opponents
of the current “government,” or ministry, or of the king. By and large
the Tories protected the landed interest; the Whigs were willing now and
then to con- sider the desires of the business class; otherwise both
Tories and Whigs were equally conservative. Neither party legislated for
the benefit of the masses.</p>
<p>No bill could become law unless approved by both houses of
Parliament</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>and signed by the king. He possessed the “royal prerogative”— i.e.,
powers, privileges, and immunities accorded him by English custom and
law. He had military powers: he was supreme commander of the army and
navy; he could declare war, but needed parliamentary appropriations to
wage it; he could negotiate treaties and make peace. He had some
legislative rights: he could withhold assent from a bill passed by
Parliament — but it could bring him to terms by its power of the purse,
and so he never exercised that right after 1714; he could add to the
laws by proclamation or by orders in council, but he could not alter the
common law, or create a new offense; for the colonies he could legislate
as he pleased. He had executive powers: he alone could summon, prorogue,
or dissolve Parliament; he appointed the ministers who directed policy
and administration. Part of the furor in the first decades (1760- 82) of
George Ill’s sixty -year reign concerned the ex- tent of the royal
prerogative in choosing ministers and determining policy.</p>
<p>The right of the king to legislate was narrowly limited, and the
measures proposed to Parliament by his ministers could be made into law
only by per- suading both houses of Parliament to accept them. This was
done by political bargains, by the promise or withholding of posts or
pensions, or by bribery. (In 1770 over 190 members of the House of
Commons held appointive places in the administration.) The pounds and
plums required for these op- erations were mostly supplied by the king’s
“civil list”— an account of his expenses for himself and his family (the
“privy purse”), for his houses and servants, for salaries paid by him,
and for pensions awarded. Parliament al- lowed George III £ 800,000
annually for this civil list; he often exceeded this in his outlays; in
1769 Parliament added ,£513,511, and in 1777 /6 1 8,- 340, to pay the
royal debts. Part of the king’s money was used to buy votes in
parliamentary elections; 11 part was used to buy votes in Parliament
itself. Funds voted by Parliament for secret service were in many cases
remitted to Parliament in bribes. When we add to this royal traffic the
money spent in elections or legislation by “nabobs” returning to England
with wealth gleaned in India, or by businessmen seeking governmental
contracts or es- cape from governmental interference, we get a picture
of political corrup- tion hardly rivaled west of the Oder, and
unpleasantly instructive on the nature of man.</p>
<p>Some minor details of the British system should be noted. Taxes were
levied upon all landowners, great or small; perhaps this entered into
the re- spect that the commonalty paid to the peerage. No standing army
— only a militia — was allowed by Parliament; this was a minor factor in
England’s superior prosperity at a time when France was supporting a
permanent army of 180,000 men, Prussia 190,000, Russia 224,000. In
wartime, however, the armed forces were rigorously recruited by
enlistment and impressment; the violations of personal liberty by this
custom, and the brutalizing cruelties of army and navy life, were dark
shadows on the English scene.</p>
<p>Blackstone felt (c. 1765) that the political structure of England was
the best the nature and education of men permitted at that time. He
quoted the classical opinion that the best form of government would be
one that com-</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>687</p>
<p>bined monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and he found all these 4
Veil and happily united” in the British constitution.</p>
<p>For as with us the executive power of the laws is lodged in a single
person, they have all the advantages of strength and dispatch that are
to be found in the most absolute monarchy; and as the legislature of the
kingdom is entrusted to three distinct powers entirely independent of
each other; first the king; sec- ondly, the lords spiritual and
temporal, which is an aristocratical assembly of persons selected for
their piety, their birth, their wisdom, their valor, or their property;
and thirdly, the House of Commons, freely chosen by the people among
themselves, which makes it a kind of democracy; as this aggregate body,
activated by different springs and attentive to different interests,…
has the supreme disposal of everything, there can no inconvenience be
attempted by either of the three branches but will be withstood by the
other two; each branch being armed with a negative power sufficient to
repel any innovation which it shall think inexpedient or dangerous.
Here, then, is lodged the sover- eignty of the British constitution, and
lodged as beneficially as is possible for society. 12</p>
<p>We may smile at the patriotic conservatism of an eminent jurist
viewing the matter from a comfortable eminence; but very probably his
judgment would have been ratified by ninety per cent of the English
people under George III.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PROTAGONISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The persons of the drama were among the most famous in English his-
tory. At the top was George III, who held the throne for the fateful
years (1760-1820) that saw England through the American and French
Revolu- tions and the Napoleonic Wars. He was the first of the
Hanoverian mon- archs to be born in England, to think of himself as an
Englishman, and to take an absorbing interest in English affairs. He was
the grandson of George II, and son of the unruly Frederick Louis, Prince
of Wales, who had died in 1751. The future George III was then twelve
years old. His mother, Prin- cess Augusta of Saxe- Gotha, frightened by
the “ill -educated and vicious young people of quality” 13 whom she met,
kept him in quarantine from such company, and brought him up — one of
nine children — in an aseptic isolation from the games, joys, turmoil,
and thought of his peers and his time. He grew up timid, lethargic,
pious, poorly educated, and unhappy. “If I ever have a son,” he told his
censorious mother, “I will not make him so unhappy as you make me.” 14
She transmitted to him her scorn of his grandfather for having tolerated
the supremacy of Parliament; repeatedly she bade him, “George, be a
king!”— recapture active leadership of the gov- ernment. A tradition
often questioned credits the youth with being influ- enced by
Bolingbroke’s Idea of a Patriot King (1749), which exhorted rul - ers
“to govern as well as to reign,” and (while “letting Parliament retain
the powers it possessed”) to initiate measures for improving English
life. 15 One of George’s teachers, Lord Waldegrave, described him in
1758 as “strictly honest, but wants that frank and open behavior which
makes honesty ami-</p>
<p>688</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>able…. He does not want resolution, but it is mixed with too much
obsti- nacy…. He has a kind of unhappiness in his temper, which… will be
a source of frequent anxiety.” 16 These qualities remained with him to
the end of his sanity.</p>
<p>After the death of George’s father the widow formed a close
friendship with John Stuart, Earl of Bute, groom of the stole in the
princely household. Bute was thirty-eight in 1751, and was already
fifteen years married to Mary Wortley Montagu, daughter of the famous
Lady Mary of that name. In the last years before George became king he
accepted Bute as his chief precep- tor and confidant. He admired the
Scot’s learning and integrity, gratefully received his advice, and was
encouraged by him to prepare for aggressive leadership in government.
When the royal youth thought of proposing mar- riage to the
fifteen-year-old beauty Lady Sarah Lennox, he yielded sadly but
affectionately to Bute’s admonition that he must marry some foreign
princess who would help to cement a useful political alliance. “I
surrender my future into your hands,” he wrote, “and will keep my
thoughts even from the dear object of my love, grieve in silence, and
never trouble you more with this unhappy tale; for if I must either lose
my friend or my love I will give up the latter, for I esteem your
friendship above every earthly joy.” 17 George took Bute with him when
he ascended the throne.</p>
<p>His reign was one of the most calamitous in England’s history, and he
shared in the blame. Yet he himself was emphatically a Christian and
usu- ally a gentleman. He accepted the theology of the Anglican Church,
ob- served its rites with unostentatious devotion, and rebuked a court
preacher who praised him in a sermon. He imitated his political enemies
in the use of bribery, and bettered their instruction, but he was a
paragon of virtue in his private life. In a generation noted for sexual
license he gave to England an example of husbandly fidelity that quietly
contrasted with the adulteries of his predecessors and the
irregularities of his brothers and sons. He was the soul of kindness in
everything but religion and politics. Though lavish in gifts, he was a
man of simple habits and tastes. He forbade gambling at his court. He
toiled resolutely at government, attending to minute details, and
sending messages of instruction to his aides and ministers a dozen times
a day. He was no somber Puritan: he liked the theater, music, and the
dance. He was not wanting in courage: he fought his political foes
tenaciously for half a century; he faced a violent mob bravely in 1780,
and kept his com- posure in two attempts upon his life. He frankly
recognized the defects of his education; to the end he remained
relatively innocent of literature, sci- ence, and philosophy. If he was
a bit weak in the mind it may have been due to some quirk in the genes
or some negligence in his teachers, as well as to the thousand strains
that hedge a king.</p>
<p>One of George’s faults was a suspicious jealousy of ability and
independ- ence. He could never forgive William Pitt I for conscious
pre-eminence in political vision and understanding, penetration of
judgment, force and elo- quence of speech. We have seen elsewhere 18 the
career of this extraordinary</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>689</p>
<p>man from his entry into Parliament (1735) to his triumph in the Seven
Years’ War. He could be arrogant and obstinate— far more so than George
III; he felt himself to be the proper custodian of the empire that had
been created under his leadership, and when the king in name met the
king in deed there followed a duel for the throne. Pitt was personally
honest, untouched by the bribery that flourished around him, but he
thought of politics purely in terms of national power, and allowed no
sentiment of humanity to divert his resolve to make England supreme. He
was called “the Great Com - moner” because he was the greatest man in
the House of Commons, not be - cause he thought of improving the lot of
the commonalty; however, he rose to defend Americans and the people of
India against oppression by English- men. Like the King he resented
criticism, and was “unapt to forget or to forgive.” 19 He would not
serve the King unless he could rule him; he re- signed from the ministry
(1761) when George III insisted on violating Eng- land’s compact with
Frederick and making a separate peace with France. If in the end he was
defeated it was by no other foe than gout.</p>
<p>Pitt’s influence on English politics was matched by Edmund Burke’s in
- fluence on English thought. Pitt disappeared from the scene in 1778;
Burke appeared on it in 1761, and held the attention of educated
England, inter- mittently, till 1794. The fact that he was born in
Dublin (1729), the son of an attorney, may have handicapped him in his
struggle for political office and power; he was not an Englishman except
by adoption, and not a mem- ber of any aristocracy except that of the
mind. The fact that his mother and sister were Catholics must have
entered into his lifelong sympathy for the Catholics of Ireland and
England, and his persistent emphasis upon re- ligion as an indispensable
bulwark of morality and the state. He received his formal education at a
Quaker school in, Ballitore, and at Trinity College, Dublin. He learned
enough Latin to admire Cicero’s orations and to make them the foundation
of his own forensic style.</p>
<p>In 1750 he passed to England to study law at the Middle Temple. Later
he praised law as “a science which does more to quicken and invigorate
the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together,”
but he thought it “not apt, except in persons very happily born, to open
and to liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion.” 20 About
1775 his father withdrew Edmund’s allowance on the ground that he was
neglecting his legal studies for other pursuits. Apparently Edmund had
developed a taste for literature, and was frequenting the theaters and
the debating clubs of London. A legend arose that he fell in love with
the famous actress Peg Woffington. He wrote to a friend in 1757: “I have
broken all rules; I have neglected all decorum”; and he described his
“manner of life” as “chequered with various designs; sometimes in
London, sometimes in remote parts of the country, sometimes in France,
and shortly, please God, to be in Ameri- ca.” Otherwise we know nothing
about Burke in those experimental years, except that in 1756, in
uncertain sequence, he published two remarkable books, and married.</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>One book was entitled A Vindication of Natural Society, or a View of
the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind from Every Species of
Artificial</p>
<p>Society. A Letter to Lord. By a late Noble Writer. The essay,
some</p>
<p>forty-five pages long, is on its face a vigorous condemnation of all
govern- ment, far more anarchistic than Rousseau’s Discourse on the
Origin of In - equality, which had appeared only a year before. Burke
defined “natural society” as “society founded in natural appetites and
instincts, and not in any positive institution.” 21 “The development of
laws was a degeneration.” 22 History is a record of but chery,
treachery, and war; 23 and “political society is justly charged with
much the greater part of this destruction.” 24 All gov - ernments follow
the Machiavellian principles, reject all moral restraints, and give the
citizens a demoralizing example of greed, deceit, robbery, and homi-
cide. 25 Democracy in Athens and Rome brought no cure for the evils of
gov- ernment, for it soon became dictatorship through the ability of
demagogues to win admiration from gullible majorities. Law is injustice
codified; it pro- tects the idle rich against the exploited poor, 26 and
adds a new evil — lawyers. 27 “Political society has made the many the
property of the few.” 28 Look at the condition of the miners of England,
and consider whether such misery could have existed in a natural society
— i.e., before the making of laws. — Should we nevertheless accept the
state, like the religion that upholds it, as being made necessary by the
nature of man? Not at all.</p>
<p>If we are resolved to submit our reason and our liberty to civil
usurpation, we have nothing to do but to conform as quietly as we can to
the vulgar [pop- ular] notions which are connected with this, and take
up the theology of the vulgar as well as their politics. But if we think
this necessity rather imaginary than real, we shall renounce their
dreams of society together with their visions of religion, and vindicate
ourselves into perfect liberty. 29</p>
<p>This has the bold ring and angry sincerity of a young radical, a
youth re- ligious in spirit but rejecting the established theology, and
sensitive to the poverty and degradation that he had seen in England; a
talent conscious of itself but as yet without place and standing in the
stream of the world. Every alert youngster passes through this stage on
his way to position, possessions, and such frightened conservatism as we
shall find in Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France. We note
that the author of the Vindication cov- ered his tracks with anonymity,
even to playing dead. Nearly all readers, in- cluding William Warburton
and the Earl of Chesterfield, understood the tract as a genuine attack
upon current evils, 30 and many ascribed it to Vis- count Bolingbroke,
who, having died in 1751, was “a late Noble Writer.” Nine years after
publishing the essay Burke ran for election to Parliament. Fearing that
his youthful ebullition would be held against him, he reprinted it in
1765 with a preface that said in part: “The design of the following
little piece was to show that… the same [literary] engines which were
employed for the destruction of religion might be employed with equal
success for the subversion of government.” 31 Most biographers of Burke
have accepted this explanation as sincere; we cannot join them, but we
can understand the effort of a political candidate to protect himself
against</p>

<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>popular prejudice. Which of us would have a future if his past were
known?</p>
<p>Just as eloquent as the Vindication, and much subtler, was Burke’s
other publication in 1756: A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of
the Sub- lime and Beautiful; to which in a second edition he added A
Discourse on Taste. We must admire the courage of the
twenty-seven-year-old youth who pursued these elusive subjects a full
decade before Lessing’s Laokoon. He may have taken a lead from the
opening of Book II of Lucretius’ De rerum natural “Pleasant it is, when
the winds are troubling the waters in a mighty sea, to witness from the
land another’s great toil; not because it is a delight to behold
anyone’s tribulation, but because it is sweet to see from what evils you
yourself are free.” So Burke wrote: “The passions which belong to
self-preservation turn on pain and danger; they are simply painful when
their causes immediately affect us; they are delightful when we have an
idea of pain and danger without being actually in such circumstances….
Whatever excites this delight I call sublime.” Secondarily, “all works
of great labor, expense, and magnificence are sublime,… and all
buildings of very great richness and splendor,… for in contemplating
them the mind applies the ideas of the greatness of exertion necessary
to produce such works, to the works themselves.” 32 Gloom, darkness,
mystery help to arouse a sense of sublimity; hence the care of medieval
builders to let only dim and filtered light enter their cathedrals.
Romantic fiction, as in Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otrant o (1764) or
Ann Radcliffe’s Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), profited from these
ideas.</p>
<p>“Beauty,” said Burke, “is a name I shall apply to all such qualities
in things as induce in us a sense of affection and tenderness, or some
other passion the most nearly resembling these.” 33 He rejected the
classical reduction of these</p>
<p>In any case June Nugent was desirable, and Burke married her in this
fe- cund year 1756. She was the daughter of an Irish physician; she was
a Catho- lic, but she soon conformed to the Anglican worship. Her mild
and gentle disposition soothed her husband’s irascible temperament.</p>
<p>The impression made by the style, if not the arguments, of the
Vindica- tion and the Enquiry opened doors to Burke. The Marquis of
Rockingham engaged him as secretary, despite the Duke of Newcastle’s
warning that</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Burke was a wild Irishman, a Jacobite, a secret papist and Jesuit. 36
Late in 1765 Burke was elected to Parliament from the borough of
Wendover through the influence of Lord Verney, “who owned it.” 37 In the
Ho use of Commons the new member acquired the reputation of an eloquent,
yet not persuasive, orator. His voice was harsh, his accent Hibernian,
his gestures awkward, his jests occasionally coarse, his denunciations
unduly passionate. Only in reading him did men perceive that he was
creating literature as he spoke — by his command of the English
language, his luminous descriptions, his range of knowledge and
illustrations, his ability to bring philosophic per- spective to the
issues of the day. Perhaps these qualities were handicaps in the House.
Some hearers, Goldsmith tells us, “loved to see him wind into his sub -
ject like a serpent,” 38 but many others were impatient with his
excessive de - tail, his digressions into theory, his ornate
declamations, his massive periodic sentences, his flights into literary
elegance; they wanted practical considera- tions and immediate
relevance; they praised his diction, but ignored his advice. So, when
Boswell said that Burke was like a hawk, Johnson coun- tered, “Yes, sir,
but he catches nothing.” 39 Almost to the end of his career he defended
policies unpalatable to the people, the ministry, and the King. “I
know,” he said, “that the road I take is not the road to preferment.”
40</p>
<p>Apparently, during the years of his climb, he read much and
judiciously. One contemporary described him as an encyclopedia, from
whose stores ev- eryone received instruction. Fox paid him an unmeasured
compliment: “If he [Fox] were to put all the political information which
he had learned from books, all which he had gained from science, and all
which any knowledge of the world and its affairs had taught him, into
one scale, and the improve- ment which he had derived from his right
honorable friend’s instruction and conversation were placed in the
other, he should be at a loss to decide to which to give the
preference.” 41 Johnson, who usually administered praise in small doses,
agreed with Fox: “You could not stand five minutes with that man beneath
a shed while it rained, but you must be convinced you had been standing
with the greatest man you had ever yet seen.” 42</p>
<p>Burke joined the Johnson-Reynolds circle about 1758. He rarely
entered into debate with the invincible debater, probably fearing his
own temper as well as Johnson’s; but when he did, the Great Cham drew in
his horns. When Johnson was sick, and someone mentioned Burke, the
Doctor cried out, “That fellow calls forth -all my powers; were I to see
Burke now it would kill me.” 43 Ye t the two men agreed on almost all
basic questions of politics, morals, and religion. They accepted the
aristocratic rule of Britain, though both were commoners; they scorned
democracy as the enthronement of mediocrity; they defended orthodox
Christianity and the Established Church as irreplaceable bastions of
morality and order. Only the revolt of the American colonies divided
them. Johnson called himself a Tory, and de- nounced Whigs as criminals
and fools; Burke called himself a Whig, and gave a stronger,
better-reasoned defense of Tory principles than any other man in English
history.</p>
<p>He seemed at times to uphold the most questionable elements of the

<p>ing order. He opposed changes in the rules for the election of
members or the enactment of laws. He thought “rotten” or “pocket”
boroughs for - givable, since they sent good men like himself to
Parliament. Instead of widening the suffrage he would, “by l essening
the number, add to the weight and independency, of our voters.” 44
Nevertheless he espoused a hundred lib - eral causes. He advocated
freedom of trade before Adam Smith, and attacked the slave trade before
Wilberforce. He advised removing the political dis- abilities of
Catholics, and supported the petition of the Dissenters for full civil
rights. He tried to soften the barbarous severity of the penal code, and
the handicaps of a soldier’s life. He vindicated the freedom of the
press though he himself had felt its sting. He stood up for Ireland,
America, India in the face of chauvinistic majorities. He championed
Parliament against the King with a candor and audacity that forfeited
all chance of political office. We may debate his views and his motives,
but we can never doubt his cour- age.</p>
<p>The last crusade of Burke’s career— against the French Revolution —
cost him the friendship of a man whom he had long admired and loved.
Charles James Fox returned his affection and shared with him the dangers
of battle in a dozen causes, but differed from him in almost every
quality of mind and character except humanity and bravery. Burke was
Irish, poor, conservative, religious, moral; Fox was English, rich,
radical, and kept only so much re- ligion as comported with gambling,
drinking, mistresses, and the French Revolution. He was the third but
favorite son of Henry Fox, who inherited one fortune, squandered it,
married another, accumulated a third as paymas- ter of the forces,
helped Bute to buy M.P.s, was rewarded by being created Baron Holland,
and was denounced as “the public defaulter of unaccounted</p>
<p>Lady Holland tried to bring up her sons to integrity and
responsibility, but Lord Holland indulged Charles in every humor, and
inverted old maxims for him: “Never do today what you can put off till
tomorrow, nor ever do yourself what you can get anyone else to do for
you.” 46 When the boy wa s barely fourteen his father took him from Eton
College for a tour of Con- tinental casinos and spas, and allowed him
five guineas per night for play. The youth returned to Eton a confirmed
gambler, and kept this up at Ox- ford. He found time to read much, both
in classical and in English literature, but he left Oxford after two
years to spend two years in travel. He learned French and Italian, lost
£ 16,000 in Naples, visited Voltaire at Ferney, and received from him a
list of books to enlighten him on Christian theology. 47 In 1 768 the
father bought a borough for him, and Charles took a seat in Par- liament
at the age of nineteen. This was quite illegal, but so many members were
impressed by the youth’s personal charm and presumptive wealth that</p>
<p>^94 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>he was made a lord of the admiralty in the ministry of Lord North. In
1774 the father, the mother, and an elder son died, and Charles became
the master of a large fortune.</p>
<p>His physical appearance in his mature years was as careless as his
morals. His stockings were loosely tied, his coat and waistcoat were
rumpled, his shirt was open at the neck, his face was puffed and ruddy
with food and drink, and his swelling paunch, when he sat, threatened to
tumble over his knees. When he fought a duel with William Adam he
rejected the advice of his second to ass ume the customary sideways
stance, for he said, “I am as thick one way as the other.” 48 He took no
pains to conceal his faults. It was common gossip that he proved to be
an amiable victim of sharpers. Once (Gibbon tells us) he played for
twenty-two hours at a sitting, and lost in that time £ 200,000. Fox
remarked that the greatest pleasure in life, next to winning, was
losing. 49 He kept a stable of racing horses, bet heavily on them, and
(we are asked to believe) won more on them than he lost. 50</p>
<p>Sometimes he was as careless of his political principles as of his
morals and his dress; more than once he let his personal interests or
animosity determine his course. He tended to indolence, and did not
prepare his parliamentary speeches or measures with that care and study
which distinguished Burke. He had few graces as an orator, and sought
none; his addresses were often formless and repetitious, sometimes
shocking the grammarians; he “threw</p>
<p>Fox’s contemporaries were lenient with his faults since these were so
widely shared, and they almost unanimously testified to his virtues.
Through most of his life after 1774 he followed liberal causes at
reckless sacrifice of preferment and popularity. Burke, who scorned
vice, nevertheless loved Fox because he saw that Fox was unselfishly
devoted to social justice and human liberty. “He is a man made to be
loved,” said Burke, “of the most artless, open, candid, and benevolent
disposition; disinterested in the extreme, of a temper mild and placable
to a fault, without one drop of gall in his whole constitution.” 53
Gibbon agreed: “Perhaps no human being was ever mo re perfectly exempt
from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood.” 54 Only George III
was immune to that spontaneous charm.</p>
<p>Bound with Burke and Fox in leading the liberal factor of the Whigs
was a second Irishman, Richard Brinsley Sheridan. His grandfather,
Thomas Sheridan I, published translations from Greek and Latin, and an
Art of Pun- ning which may have infected the grandson. The father,
Thomas Sheridan II, was by some ranked second only to Garrick as actor
and theatrical man- ager. He married Frances Chamber laine, a successful
playwright and novel- ist. He received degrees from Dublin, Oxford, and
Cambridge; lectured at Cambridge on education; was instrumental in
getting Johnson a royal pen-</p>

<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>695</p>
<p>sion, and got one for himself. He wrote an entertaining Life of
Swift, and dared to publish a General Dictionary of the English Language
(1780) only twenty- five years after Johnson’s. He helped his son manage
Drury Lane Theatre, and saw him rise in romance, literature, and
Parliament.</p>
<p>So Richard had wit and drama in his milieu, if not in his blood. Born
in Dublin (1751), he was sent to Harrow at the age of eleven, stayed
there six years, and acquired a good classical education; at twenty he
echoed his grandfather by publishing translations from the Greek. In
that year 1771, while living at Bath with his parents, he fell into
raptures over the lovely face and voice of Elizabeth Ann Linley,
seventeen, who sang in the con- certs presented by her father, composer
Thomas Linley. Those who have seen any of Gainsborough’s portraits of
her 55 will understand that Richard</p>
<p>Elizabeth Ann had many suitors, including Richard’s elder brother</p>
<p>Charles. One of them, Major Mathews, rich but married, annoyed her to
such aggravation that she took laudanum to kill herself. She recovered,
but lost all desire for life until Richard’s devotion revived her
spirits. Mathews</p>
<p>Too proud to let his wife support him by public singing, Richard,
twenty- two, undertook to make a fortune by writing plays. On January
17, 1775, his first comedy, The Rivals, was produced at Covent Garden.
It was poorly acted and poorly received; Sheridan secured a better actor
for the leading role, and a second performance (January 28) began a
series of dramatic successes that brought Sheridan fame and wealth. Soon
all London was talk- ing about Sir Anthony Absolute, Sir Lucius O
’Trigger, and Miss Lydia Lan - guish, and was imitating Mrs. Malaprop’s
mangling of words (“Forget this fellow, illiterate him quite from your
memory”; 57 “as headstrong as an al - legory on the banks of the
Nile.”). 58 Sheridan had a mint of sallies in his brain, scattering them
on every page, dowering lackeys with wit, and making fools talk like
philosophers. Critics complained that the characters were not always
consistent with their speech, and that the wit, crackling in every
scene, bubbling in almost every mouth, dulled its point by excess; no
matter; audiences relished the merriment, and relish it to this day.</p>
<p>6 9 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Even greater was the success of The Duenna, which had its premiere at
Covent Garden on November 2, 1775; it ran for seventy-five nights in its
first season, breaking the record of sixty- three nights set by The
Beggar’s Opera in 1728. David Garrick, at the Drury Lane Theatre, was
alarmed by this lively competition, but could find no better riposte
than to revive The Discovery, a play by Sheridan’s lately deceased
mother. Flushed with suc - cess, Sheridan offered to buy Garrick’s half
share of the Drury Lane; Gar- rick, feeling his years, agreed for £
35,000; Sheridan persuaded his father- in-law and a friend to contribute
£ 10,000 each; he himself invested £ 1,300 in cash; the remainder he
raised on a loan (1776). Two years later he gathered together another £
35,000, took ownership of the theater with his partners, and assumed the
management.</p>
<p>Many thought thdt his confidence had overreached itself, but Sheridan
went on to another triumph by producing (May 8, 1777) The School for
Scandal, the greatest dramatic success of the century. The author’s
father,</p>
<p>He looked around for new worlds to conquer, and decided to enter Par-
liament. He paid the burgesses of Stafford five guineas for their vote,
and in 1780 he took his seat in the House of Commons as an ardent
liberal. He shared with Fox and Burke in prosecuting Warren Hastings,
and in one brilliant day outshone them both. Meanwhile he lived with his
accomplished wife in happiness and luxury, famed for his conversation,
his wit, his exuber- ance, his kindness, and his debts. Lord Byron
summed up the marvel: “What - soever Sheridan has done, or chooses to
do, has been par excellence, always the best of its kind. He has written
the best comedy, the best drama,… the best farce,… the best address [a
Monologue on Garrick ], and, to crown all, delivered the very best
oration… ever conceived or heard in this country.” 59 And he had won and
kept the love of the loveliest woman in Eng - land.</p>
<p>Sheridan was all romance; it is hard to picture him in the same world
and generation as William Pitt II, who recognized only reality, stood
above sen- timent, and ruled without eloquence. He was born (1759) at
the height of his father’s career; his mother was sister to George
Grenville, chief minister 1763-65; he was nursed on politics, and grew
up in the odor of Parliament. Frail and sickly in childhood, he was kept
from the rigors and socializing</p>
<p>chap.xxviii) the political drama 697</p>
<p>contacts of “public” school; he was tutored at home under the careful
super - vision of his father, who taught him elocution by making him
recite Shake- speare or Milton every day. By the age of ten he was a
classical scholar and had written a tragedy. At fourteen he was sent to
Cambridge, soon fell ill, returned home; a year later he went again,
and, being a peer’s son, he was graduated as Master of Arts in 1776
without examination. He studied law at Lincoln’s Inn, practiced law
briefly, and was projected into Parliament at the age of twenty-one from
a pocket borough controlled by Sir James Lowther. His maiden speech so
well supported Burke’s proposal for economic reforms tha t Burke called
him “not a chip of the old block but the old block itself.” 60</p>
<p>Being a second son, he was allowed only £ 300 a year, with occasional
help from his mother and uncles; these conditions encouraged a stoic
sim- plicity in his conduct and character. He avoided marriage, having
pledged himself indivisibly to the pursuit of power. He took no pleasure
in gambling or the theater. Though he later used liquor in excess to
dull his nerves after the tumult of politics, he earned a reputation for
purity of life and incor- ruptibility of purpose; he could buy, but he
could not be bought. He never sought wealth, and seldom made concessions
to friendship; only an intimate few discovered, behind his cold
aloofness and self-control, a friendly gaiety, even at times an
affectionate tenderness.</p>
<p>Early in 1782, when Lord North’s ministry was about to resign,
“the</p>
<p>boy,” as some members condescendingly called Pitt, included in one of
his speeches a rather unusual announcemen t: “For myself, I could not
expect to form part of a new administration; but were my doing so within
my reach, I feel myself bound to declare that I never would accept a
subordinate posi- tion”; 81 that is, he would accept no place lower than
the six or seven seats that constituted what came to be called the
cabinet. When the new ministry offered to appoint him vice-treasurer of
Ireland at £ 5,000 a year, he de- clined, and continued to live on his £
300. He was confident of advance- ment, and hoped to win it on his own
merits; he worked hard, and became the best-informed man in the House on
domestic politics, industry, and finance. A year after his proud
pronouncement the King turned to him not merely to join but to head the
government. No man before him had ever been chief minister at the age of
twenty-four; and few ministers have left a deeper mark on English
history.</p>

<li>THE KING VERSUS PARLIAMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>George II completed his reign of thirty-three years with a decided
distaste for English politics. “I am sick to death of all this foolish
stuff, and wish with all my heart that the Devil may take all your
bishops, and the Devil take your ministers, and the Devil take your
Parliament, and the Devil take the whole island, provide d I can get out
of it and go to Hanover.” 62 He found peace on October 25, 1760, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>The accession of George III on the day of his grandfather’s death
was</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>welcomed enthusiastically by nearly all Englishmen except a few who
still hankered after the Stuarts. He was twenty-two, handsome,
industrious, and modest. (He was the first English king since Henry VI
to omit in his title a claim to the sovereignty over France.) In his
first address to Parliament he added, to the text prepared for him by
his ministers, words that neither of his Hanoverian predecessors could
have spoken: “Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
Briton.” “The young King,” wro te Horace Walpole, “has all the
appearance of being amiable. There is great grace to temper much
dignity, and extreme good nature, which breaks out on all oc- casions.”
63 He added to his popularity by the proclamation that he issued on
October 3 1 “for the encouragement of piety and virtue, and for
preventing and punishing of vice, profaneness, and immorality.” In 1761
he married Princess Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; adjusting
himself to her charmlessness, he begot fifteen children by her, and
found no time for adul- tery. This was unprecedented for a Hanoverian
king.</p>
<p>He did not like the Seven Years’ War, then four years old, and felt
that some adjustment could be made with France. William Pitt I,
secretary of state for the Southern Department, and the dominant figure
in the ministry of the Duke of Newcastle, insisted on continuing the war
until France should be weakened beyond any likelihood of her challenging
the empire that had been created by British victories in Canada and
India; moreover, he urged, no peace should be made except in concert
with England’s ally, Fred - erick the Great. In March, 1761, the Earl of
Bute was made secretary of state for the Northern Department, and
proceeded with the plan for a sepa- rate peace. Pitt resisted in vain,
and on October 5 he resigned. George mol- lified him with a pension of £
3,000 for himself and his heir, and a peerage for his wife, who became
Baroness of Chatham. Pitt (till 1766) refused a peerage for himself,
since this would have excluded him from his favorite battlefield, the
House of Commons. As he had spoken of pensions with scorn, he was
severely criticized for accepting these emoluments, but they were less
than he had earned, and others who had earned far less received far
more.</p>
<p>On May 26, 1762, the Duke of Newcastle gave up his post after forty-
five years of prominence in politics. Three days later Bute succeeded
him as chief minister. Now the purposes of the young King took form and
drive. He and Bute considered it part of the royal prerogative to
determine the major lines of policy, especially in foreign affairs.
Furthermore, he was eager to break the hold which a few rich families
had taken on the government. In 1761 an old Whig, William Pulteney, Earl
of Bath, in an anonymous pam- phlet, urged the King not to be content
with the “shadow of royalty,” but to use his “legal prerogatives” to
check the “illegal claims of factious oli - garchy.” 64</p>
<p>The majority in the House of Commons held that the King should choose
his ministers from the acknowledged leaders of the party or faction
victori- ous in the elections; George insisted on his legal right to
choose his ministers regardless of party, with no restrictions except
his responsibility to the na-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE POLITICAL DRAMA 699</p>
<p>ion. 65 The Whigs had engineered the accession of the Hanoverian
Elector to the throne of England; some Tories had negotiated with the
exiled Stu- arts; inevitably the first two Georges had taken only Whigs
into their gov- ernment; most of the Tories had retired to their
estates. But in 1760 they ac- cepted the new dynasty, and came in
considerable number to offer their homage to the British-born King.
George welcomed them, and saw no rea- son why he should not appoint able
Tories, as well as able Whigs, to office. The Whigs protested that if
the King were free to choose ministers and de- termine policy without
responsibility to Parliament, the “Bill of Rights” of 1689 would be
violated, the authority of the King would remount to the level claimed
by Charles I, and the revolutions of 1642 and 1688 would be nullified.
The party system had its faults, but (the leaders argued) it was in-
dispensable to responsible government; it offered to each ministry an
opposi- tion that watched it, criticized it, and (when the electors so
desired) could replace it with men equipped to alter the direction of
policy without dis- turbing the stability of the state. So the lines
formed for the first major con- flict of powers in the new reign.</p>
<p>Bute bore the brunt of the battle. Criticism mostly spared the King,
but not his mother; lampoons accused her of being Bute’s mistress; this
calumny roused the King to uncompromising wrath. Bute concluded a
separate peace with France, and to force Frederick’s acquiescence he
ended England’s sub - sidies to Prussia; Frederick called him a
scoundrel, and fought on. The Eng- lish people, though glad to have the
war ended, denounced the peace as too lenient to defeated France; Pitt
fulminated against it, and predicted that France, with her navy left
intact, would soon resume war on England — which she did in 1778. The
House of Commons ratified the treaty, 319 to 65. George’s mother
rejoiced that the royal will had prevailed; “Now,” she said, “my son is
really King of England.” 66</p>
<p>Hitherto the new sovereign had enjoyed a reputation for integrity.
But when he saw that the Whigs were buying parliamentary votes, and were
engaging journalists to attack his policies, he resolved to better the
instruc- tion. He used his funds and his power of patronage to induce
authors like Smollett to defend the aims and actions of the ministry.
Perhaps Bute had such services in view when, in July, 1762, he persuaded
the King to give a pension to Samuel Johnson, and he was not
disappointed. But no partisan of the minister could offset the clever
diatribes of John Wilkes, the savage sat- ires of Charles Churchill, or
the anonymous vituperation of “Junius.” “Li - bels on the court,
exceeding in audacity and rancor any that had been pub- lished for many
years, now appeared daily, in both prose and verse.” 67</p>
<p>Parliament took the King’s mon ey and gave him votes, but it disliked
his chief minister as a Scot who had not risen to power through long
service to some party in the House. Feeling against Scotland ran high in
an England that still remembered the Scottish invasion of 1745.
Moreover, Bute had given political plums to his countrymen: he had made
Robert Adam court architect and Allan Ramsay court painter (ignoring
Reynolds) ; he had pen- sioned John Home, the Scottish playwright, while
refusing a professorship</p>
<p>7 °° ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>o Thomas Gray. The London populace expressed its feelings by hanging
or burning a jackboot (as a pun for Bute), and by attacking the
minister’s car - riage; he had to hide his face when he attended the
theater. A tax on cider alienated the rural population, and left Bute
the most unpopular minister in English history. Unable to breast the
torrent, broken in health and spirits, and realizing his unfitness for
the agitation and intrigues of politics, Bute resigned (April 8, 17 63),
after less than a year as chief ’minister to the King.</p>
<p>His successor, George Grenville, suffered three misfortunes: he was
at- tacked in the press by the invincible John Wilkes (1763 f.); he put
through Parliament (March, 1765) the Stamp Act that began the alienation
of the American colonies; and George III had his first fit of insanity.
The failure and resignation of Bute had broken the King’s nerves and
resolution; his mar - riage had brought him no happiness; and Grenville
was painfully independ- ent, almost domineering. George soon recovered,
but he no longer felt strong enough to resist the Whig oligarchy that
controlled most of Parliament and the press. He compromised by inviting
a Whig, the Marquis of Rockingham, to form a new ministry.</p>
<p>Perhaps on suggestions from his secretary, Edmund Burke, the Marquis
in a year put through Parliament several mollifying measures. The cider
tax was abolished or modified; the stamp tax was repealed; a treaty with
Russia furthered trade; the agitation over Wilkes was subdued; and
apparently no bribery was used to advance this legislation. The King
resented the repeal of the tax, and the concessions to Wilkes. On July
12, 1766, he dismissed the Rockingham ministry, offered a peerage to
Pitt, and asked him to take charge of the government. Pitt agreed.</p>
<p>But the “Great Commoner” had lost his health, almost his mind. Now he
sacrificed what remained of his popularity by accepting ennoblement as
Earl of Chatham, thereby abandoning his place in the House. He had some
ex- cuse: he felt too weak to bear the tensions and conflicts of the
Commons; in the Lords he would have more leisure and less strain. He
took a relatively quiet post as lord of the privy seal, and allowed his
friend, the Duke of Graf- ton, to fill the nominally pre-eminent post as
first lord of the treasury. His colleagues, however, noted that he
determined policy without consulting them, or over their opposition, and
many were relieved when he went to Bath to seek some easing of his gout.
He achieved this, but with drugs that disordered his mind. When he
returned to London he was in no condition to attend to politics. In
October, 1768, he resigned, and Grafton became chief minister.</p>
<p>It was in this period of political anarchy (1766-68) that a group
known as “the King’s Friends” associated themselves to further the aims
of the King. They guided George in his distribution of favors for
political support, and used every means to elect candidates, and advance
ministers, pledged to the royal views. When Grafton enmeshed himself in
difficulties and blunders they compounded his confusion until he
resigned (January 27, 1770). On February 10 they achieved their greatest
victory when Frederick North (known to us as Lord North, though he fell
heir to this title only in 1790) began his twelve years of service as
first lord of the treasury.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>North was a weak, but not a bad, man. It was his sense of loyalty and
pity that kept him in office and earned him so unpleasant a place in
history. Born to fortune as son of the Earl of Guilford, he received all
the advantages of education and association, entered the House of
Commons at the age of twenty-two, and kept his seat there for nearly
forty years. He made many friends by his modesty, kindliness,
affability, and humor.* But he followed the conservative side too
consistently to please anyone but the King. He supported the Stamp Act,
the expulsion of Wilkes, and (until its last stages) the war with
America. He defended the policies of George III even when he doubted
their wisdom; he considered himself the agent of the King, not of the
Parliament, much less of the people, and he seems to have been sincere
in his conviction that the sovereign had the legal right to choose
ministers and direct policy. Through North, and his tact in managing the
House of Commons — and through the use of funds voted by Parliament —
George III for a decade ruled England. Through his agents he bought
seats and votes, sold pensions and posts, subsidized journalists, and
tried to shackle the press. It is a measure of his courage and his
obstinacy that it took a combination of John Wilkes, “Junius,” Burke,
Fox, Sheridan, Franklin, and Washington to defeat him.</p>

<li>PARLIAMENT VERSUS THE PEOPLE</li>
</ol>
<p>We read in Gibbon’s Journal under September 23, 1762:</p>
<p>Colonel Wilkes dined with us…. I scarcely ever met with a better com-
panion. He has inexhaustible spirits, infinite wit and humor, and a
great deal of knowledge, but is a thorough profligate in principle as in
practice. His character is infamous, his life strained with every vice,
and his conversation full of blas- phemy and bawdy. These morals he
glories in — for shame is a weakness he has long since surmounted. He
told us himself that in this time of public dissension he was resolved
to make his fortune. 69</p>
<p>This was the view of a conservative who voted with the government in
all his eight years as a member of the House of Commons, and who could
not readily sympathize with a confessed and colorful enemy of Parliament
and the King. Wilkes, however, would have admitted most of the
indictment. He had discarded the ethics as well as the theology of
Christianity, and en- joyed flaunting his hedonism in the face of M.P.s
who shared his morals but were alarmed by his candor.</p>
<p>John Wilkes was the son of a malt distiller in Clerkenwell, north
London. He received a good education at Oxford and Leiden, enough to
surprise Johnson with his knowledge of the classics and his “manners of
a gentle - man.” 70 At twenty he married “a lady half as old again as
myself,” but “of a large fortune.” 71 She was a Dissenter given to a
solemn piety; he took to</p>

<li>When one speaker complained that North slept through the oration,
North replied that it was unjust to complain of his taking a remedy
which the honorable gentleman himself had supplied. When an irate member
demanded his head he answered that he would gladly sur- render it
provided he did not have to accept the member’s head in exchange.

<p>drink and mistresses. About 1757 he joined Sir Francis Dashwood, Bubb
Dodington, George Selwyn, the poet Charles Churchill, and the fourth
Earl of Sandwich in a “Hell - Fire Club” that met in the old Cistercian
Abbey of Medmenham on the b anks of the Thames near Marlow. There, as
“the Mad Monks of Medmenham,” they caricatured Roman Catholic rites by
cele - brating a “Black Mass” to Satan, and indulging their profane and
Priapean bent. 72</p>
<p>Through the influence of his associates, and by the expenditure of
^7,000, Wilkes was elected M.P. for Aylesbury (1757). He attached
himself at first to the elder Pitt, and, after 1760, to the foes of
Bute. As Bute was sub- sidizing Smollett’s journal The Briton , Wilkes,
aided by Churchill, began in June, 1762, a counter weekly, The North
Briton , which gained a wide read- ership through the verve and wit of
its style, and the virulence of its attacks upon the ministry. In one
number he denied at length — i.e., he spread — the rumor that Bute had
ma de a mistress of the King’s mother. In No. 45 (April 23, 1763) he
inveighed against Bute for violating England’s agreement with Prussia by
concluding a separate peace with France, and for pretending, in a
“speech from the throne” presented by the minist er in the name of the
King, that this treaty had the sanction of Frederick the Great.</p>
<p>This week has given the public the most abandoned instance of
ministerial effrontery ever attempted… on mankind. The minister’s speech
of last Tuesday is not to be paralleled in the annals of this country. I
am in doubt whether the imposition is greater on the sovereign or on the
nation. Every friend of his country must lament that a prince of so many
great and amiable qualities… can be brought to give the sanction of his
sacred name to the most odious measures, and to the most unjustifiable
public declarations…. I am sure all foreigners, especially the King of
Prussia, will hold the minister in contempt and a bhorrence. He had made
our sovereign declare: “My expecta - tions have been fully answered by
the happy effects which the several allies of my crown have derived from
the Definitive Treaty. The powers at war with my good brother the King
of Prussia have been induced to agree to such terms of accommodation as
that great prince has approved.” The infamous fallacy of this whole
sentence is apparent to all mankind, for it is known that the King of
Prussia… was basely deserted by the Scottish prime minister of England….
As to the “entire approbation” of Parliament which is so vainly boasted
of, the world knows how that was obtained. The large debt on the Civil
List… shows pretty clearly the transactions of the winter. 73</p>
<p>Though Wilkes had interpreted the “King’s speech” as really
Bute’s,</p>
<p>George III took the article as a personal affront, and ordered Lords
Hali- fax and Egremont, then secretaries of state, to arrest all persons
involved in the publication of The North Briton’s No. 45. They issued a
general war- rant — i.e., one not naming the persons to be apprehended;
and on its vague terms forty-nine persons were imprisoned, including
Wilkes (April 30,</p>
<p>1763), despite his claim of immunity as a member of Parliament.
Williams, printer of the journal, was put in the pillory, but a crowd
cheered him as a martyr and raised £ 200 for his relief. Wilkes applied
to the Court of Com- mon Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus, obtained it,
argued his case, and won</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>7°3</p>
<p>from Chief Justice Charles Pratt (a friend of Pitt) an order for his
release on the ground that his arrest violated parliamentary privilege.
Wilkes sued Halifax and others for illegal arrest and property injury,
and obtained £ 5,000 in damages. Pratt’s condemnation of general
warrants ended an abuse almost as obnoxious to Britons as lettres de
cachet to the French.</p>
<p>Tempting fate, Wilkes collaborated with Thomas Potter (son of the</p>
<p>Archbishop of Canterbury) in composing an Essay on Woman as a po-
etic parody of Pope’s Essay on Man. It was a medley of obscenity and
blas - phemy, equipped with learned notes in the same key, ascribed to
Bishop William WarSurton, who had added notes to Pope’s poem. The little
piece was print ed by Wilkes’s press in his own home; it was not
published, but thirteen copies were struck off for a few friends. The
King’s ministers se - cured the proof sheets, and persuaded the Earl of
Sandwich to read them to the House of Lords. The Earl did (November 15),
to the amusement of the peers, who knew his reputation for profligacy.
Walpole tells us that they “could not keep their countenance” 74 as
Sandwich proceeded, but they agreed that the poem was “a scandalous,
obscene, and impious libel,” and asked the King to prosecute Wilkes for
blasphemy. When Sandwich told Wilkes that he would die either on the
gallows or from venereal disease, Wilkes answered, “That depends, my
Lord, on whether I embrace your principles or your mistress.” 75</p>
<p>On that same November 1 5 Wilkes rose in the Commons to enter a com-
plaint of breach of privilege in his arrest. He was voted down, and
Parlia- ment ordered the hangman to publicly burn No. 45 of The North
Briton. On the seventeenth Samuel Martin, who had been abused in that
issue, chal- lenged Wilkes to a duel. They met in Hyde Park; Wilkes was
seriously wounded, and was bedded for a month. The people of London
condemned Martin as a hired assassin; they rioted when the hangman tried
to burn No. 45; “Wilkes and liberty!” and “Number Forty - five” became
watchwords of a rising popular rebellion against both King and
Parliament. 76 After a fren- zied Scot tried to kill him, Wilkes left
for France (December 26). On Jan- uary 19, 1764, he was formally
expelled from Parliament. On February 21 he was judged guilty, in the
Court of King’s Bench, for reprinting No. 45 and for printing the Essay
on Woman; he was summoned to appear for sen- tencing; he did not come,
and on November 1 he was declared an outlaw.</p>
<p>For four years Wilkes wandered in France and Italy, fearing life
imprison- ment if he returned to England. In Rome he saw much of
Winckelmann; in Naples he met Boswell, who found him interesting
company. “His lively and energetic sallies on moral questions gave to my
spirits a not unpleasant agita- tion.” 77 On the way back to Paris
Wilkes visited Voltaire at Ferney, and charmed the wittiest man in
Europe with his wit.</p>
<p>The return of the liberals to power under Rockingham and Grafton led
Wilkes to hope for a pardon. He received private assurances that he
would not be molested if he remained quiet. He returned to England
(1768), and announced his candidacy for Parliament from London. Losing
that contest, he sought election from Middlesex, and received a
substantial plurality after</p>
<p>704</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>a riotous campaign; that county, largely urbanized (it now includes
north- west London), was known for its radical leanings and its
hostility to the rising capitalism. On April 20 Wilkes submitted to the
court, expecting to have his sentence of outlawry annulled; it was, but
he was condemned to a fine of £ 1 ,000 and imprisonment for twenty-two
months. An angry crowd rescued him from the officers and bore him in
triumph through the streets of London. Having escaped from his admirers,
he gave himself up to jail in St. George’s Fields. A mob assembled there
on May 10 and proposed to free him again. Soldiers fired upon the
rioters; five were killed, fifteen wounded. On February 4, 1769, the
House of Commons again expelled him; Middle- sex again elected him
(February 16); he was again expelled; Middlesex again elected him (April
13), this time by a vote of 1,143 to 2 96 for Henry Lut- trell;
Parliament gave the seat to Luttrell on the ground that Wilkes, having
been expelled from Parliament, was legally disqualified during the
tenure of that Parliament. Luttrell was attacked as he left the House;
he did not dare appear on the streets. 78 Seventeen counties and many
boroughs sent up ad- dresses to the throne, complaining that the rights
of freeholders to choose their representatives in the House of Commons
had been flagrantly violated. The King, who had vigorously supported the
expulsions, ignored the peti- tions, whereupon one member, Colonel Isaac
Barre, said in Parliament that disregard of petitions “might teach the
people to think of assassination.” 79 * John Horne Tooke, a young parson
who had surrendered his faith to the charm of Voltaire, unfrocked
himself and declared, after the repeated dis- barments of Wilkes, that
he would dye his (ministerial) black coat red.</p>
<p>Tooke led in organizing the Society of Supporters of the Bill of
Rights (1769), whose immediate purpose was to free Wilkes from jail, pay
his debts, and restore him to Parliament. In public meetings it agitated
for the dissolution of the current Parliament as irreclaimably corrupt,
and as un- responsive to the general will; it called for annual
Parliaments elected by universal adult male suffrage, and for the
responsibility of ministries to Par- liament in their policies and
expenditures. 80 Every candidate for Parliament should take oath never
to accept any form of bribe, nor any post or pension or other emolument
from the Crown; and every member must defend the views of his
constituents even if contrary to his own. The grievances of Ire- land
should be redressed, and the American colonies should alone have the
right to tax their people. 81</p>
<p>In July, 1769, William Beckford, as lord mayor of London, and the
city’s “livery,” or uniformed officials, presented to the King an
address censuring the conduct of his ministers as subverting the
constitution on which the house of Hanover had been given the throne of
England. On March 14, 1770, they sent up to the King a remonstrance that
used the language of rev- olution: “Under the secret and malign
influence which, through each suc - cessive administration, has defeated
every good and suggested every bad intention, the majority of the House
of Commons have deprived your people</p>
<ul>
<li>The city of Wilkes-Barre, in Pennsylvania, was named for Wilkes and
Barre, who strongly supported the cause of the colonies in
Parliament.</li>

<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE POLITICAL DRAMA 705</p>
<p>of their dearest rights. They have done a deed more ruinous in its
conse- quences than the levying of ship money by Charles I, or the
pensioning power assumed by James II.” 82 It appealed to the King to
restore “constitu - tional government,… remove those evil ministers
forever from your councils,” 83 and dissolve the present Parliament. The
infuriated monarch, laying his hand on his sword, exclaimed, “Sooner
than yield to a dissolution, I will have reco urse to this.” 84 London,
rather than Paris, seemed near to rev - olution in 1770.</p>
<p>Into this fiery vortex of politics “Junius” dropped the most
incendiary letters in the history of England. He kept his identity so
secret, even from his publishers, that to this day no one knows who he
was, though most guesses name Sir Philip Francis, whom we shall meet as
the unrelenting foe of Warren Hastings. The author had already signed
some letters “Lucius,” some “Brutus”; now he took the middle name of
that Lucius Junius Brutus who, according to Livy, had deposed a king
(c. 5 10 b.c.) and founded the Ro- man Republic. The virile command of
English in these letters indicates that “Junius” had the education, if
not the manners, of a gentleman. He was probably a man of means, for he
took no money for the letters, whose force and sting profitably enlarged
the circulation of The Public Advertiser, in which they appeared from
November 2 1 , 1768, to January 21, 1772.</p>
<p>In a “Dedication to the English Nation,” which he prefixed to the col
- lected Letters of Junius (1772), the author proclaimed his purpose to
“assert the freedom of election, and vindicate your exclusive right to
choose your representatives.” H e took as his starting point the
repeated disbarment of Wilkes, and the arrest, by a general warrant, of
everybody connected with The North Briton’s No. 45. “The liberty of the
press is the Palladium of all the civil, political, and religious rights
of an Englishman; and the right of juries… is an essential part of our
constitution.” From this standpoint the author reviewed the foundations
of the British government. “The power of the King, Lords, and Commons is
not an arbitrary power. They are the trustees, not the owners, of the
estate. The fee simple is in us…. I am per- suaded you will not leave it
to the choice of seven hundred persons, notori- ously corrupted by the
Crown, whether seven million of their equals shall be freemen or
slaves.” 85</p>
<p>Junius proceeded to charge the administration of Grafton (1768-70)
with selling offices and corrupting Parliament by favors and bribes.
Here the attack became direct, and rose to such heat as to suggest a
resolve to avenge some personal injury or affront.</p>
<p>Come forward, thou virtuous minister, and tell the world by what
interest Mr. Hine has been recommended to so extraordinary a mark of his
Majesty’s favor; what was the price of the patent he has bought?… You
are basely setting up the royal patronage to auction…. Do you think it
possible such enormities should escape without impeachment? It is indeed
highly your inter- est to maintain the present House of Commons. Having
sold the nation in gross, they will undoubtedly protect you in the
detail, for while they patronize your crimes, they feel for their own.
86</p>
<p>706 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>The attack continued long after Grafton had resigned, as in the
letter of June 22, I771:</p>
<p>I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the
meanest and the basest fellow in the Kingdom. I protest, my Lord, I do
not think you so. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame…
as long as there is one man living who thinks you worthy of his
confidence, and fit to be trusted with any share in his government.</p>
<p>This seemed to name George III himself as “the basest fellow in the
King - dom.” Already, in Letter xxxv, Junius had proposed to attack the
King “with dignity and firmness, but not with respect”: “Sir, it is the
misfortune of your life… that you should never have been acquainted with
the lan- guage of truth until you heard it in the complaints of your
people. It is not, however, too late to correct the error of your
education.” Junius advised George to dismiss his Tory ministers, and to
allow Wilkes to hold the seat to which he had been elected. “The Prince,
while he plumes himself upon the security of his title to the crown,
should remember that as it was acquired by one revolution, it may be
lost by another.” 87</p>
<p>Henry Woodfall, who published this letter in The Public Advertiser,
was arrested on a charge of seditious libel. The jury, reflecting the
feelings of the middle class, refused to convict him, and he was
released on payment of costs. Junius had now reached the apex of his
temerity and power. But the King stood his ground, and strengthened his
position by giving the chief ministry to the amiable and immovable Lord
North. Junius continued his letters till 1772, and then left the field.
We note that in 1772 Sir Philip Francis left the War Office (of whose
affairs Junius had shown intimate knowl- edge), and departed for
India.</p>
<p>The letters belong to the literary as well as the political history
of Eng- land, for they are a living example of the style to which many
British states- men could rise, or stoop, when passion inflamed — and
anonymity protected — them. Here is sterling English alloyed with abuse,
but the abuse itself is often a masterpiece of subtle thrust or piercing
epigram. There is no mercy here, no generosity, no thought that the
accuser’s own party shared in sin and guilt with the accused. We
sympathize with Sir William Draper, who, answe ring Junius’ letter of
January 21, 1769, wrote: “The kingdom swarms with such numbers of
felonious robbers of private character and virtue that no honest man is
safe, especially as these cowardly base assassins stab in the dark,
without having the courage to sign their real names to their malevo-
lent, wicked productions.” 88</p>
<p>The passage of the British press to ever greater freedom and
influence was marked by another conflict in these years. Toward 1768
some newspapers began to print reports of the major speeches delivered
in Parliament. Most of these reports were partisan and inaccurate, some
were imaginary, some were scurrilous. In February, 1771, Colonel George
Onslow complained to the House of Commons that a journ al had referred
to him as “the little</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>707</p>
<p>scoundrel” and “that paltry insignificant insect.” On March 12 the
House ordered the arrest of the printers. They resisted, arrested their
would-be captors, and brought them before two aldermen (one of whom was
Wilkes) and the Lord Mayor, Brass Crosby. The latter voided the
attempted appre- hension of the printers on the ground that the charters
of the city forbade the arrest of a Londoner except on warrant issued by
a city magistrate. The Lord Mayor was committed to the Tower by order of
Parliament, but the populace rose in his support, attacked the carriages
of M.P.s, threatened the ministers, hissed the King, and invaded the
House of Commons. The Lord Mayor was released, and was acclaimed by an
immense crowd. Newspapers resumed their reports of parliamentary
debates; Parliament ceased to prose- cute the printers. In 1774 Luke
Hansard, with the consent of Parliament, be- gan to publish with
promptness and accuracy the Journals of the House of Commons , and he
continued these till his death in 1828.</p>
<p>This historic victory of the British press affected the character of
parlia- mentary debates, and contributed to make the second half of the
eighteenth century the golden age of English eloquence. Orators became
more cau- tious, perhaps more dramatic, when they felt that they were
being heard throughout the British Isles. Some advance toward democracy
was inevita- ble now that political information and intelligence were
more widely spread. The business class, the intellectual community, and
the rising radicals found in the press a voice that became increasingly
bold and effective, until it sub- dued monarchy itself. Electors could
know now how well their representa- tives had defended them and their
interests in the making and unmaking of laws. Corruption continued, but
diminished, for it could be more openly ex- posed. The press became a
third force that could sometimes hold the balance between classes in the
nation or parties in Parliament. Men who could buy or control newspapers
became as powerful as ministers.</p>
<p>The new freedom, like most liberties, was frequently abused.
Sometimes it became the instrument of aims more selfish and partisan, of
opposition coarser and more violent, than any that had appeared in
Parliament; then it deserved the name that Chatham gave it — “a
chartered libertine.” 89 In its turn it had to be chastened by a fourth
voice, public opinion, of which, however, the press was partly the
source, often the seducer, sometimes the voice. Armed with broader
knowledge, untitled men and women began to speak out on the policies and
methods of the government; they gathered in public meetings, and their
debates occasionally rivaled those of Parliament in influ- ence on
history. Now money as well as birth could claim the right to rule; and
occasionally, between the combatants, the people would be heard. Wilkes
was released from jail on April 17, 1770. Many houses were il- luminated
as for a festival, and the Lord Mayor displayed before his Man- sion
House a sign bearing the word liberty in letters three feet high. 90
Soon Wilkes was elected alderman, then lord mayor, and in 1774 he was
again sent to Parliament by Middlesex. Now the Commons did not dare
refuse him his seat, and he kept it through all elections till 1790. He
led a small</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>group of “radicals” in Parliament, who ur ged parliamentary reform
and the enfranchisement of the “lower orders.”</p>
<p>Every free agent in this kingdom should, in my wish, be represented
in Par- liament. The mean and insignificant boroughs, so emphatically
styled the rotten part of our constitution, should be lopped off, and
the rich, populous trading towns — Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield,
Leeds, and others — be permitted to send deputies to the great council
of the nation…. I wish, Sir, an Eng lish Parliament to speak the free,
unbiased sense of the body of the English people. 91</p>
<p>Parliament waited fifty-six years to accept these reforms.</p>
<p>Wilkes refused to stand for re-election in 1790, and retired into
private life. He died in 1797, aged seventy, as poor as he was born, for
he had been scrupulously honest in all his offices. 92</p>
<p>V. ENGLAND VERSUS AMERICA</p>
<p>In 1750 the population of the English colonies in North America was
ap- proximately 1,750,000; the population of England and Wales was some
6,i4o,ooo. 93 As the rate of growth in the colonies was much higher than
in the mother country, it was only a matter of time when the offspring
would rebel against the parent. Montesquieu had predicted this in 1730,
even to specifying that the break would be caused by British
restrictions on Ameri- can trade. The Marquis d’Argenson, about 1747,
foretold that the colonies would rise against England, form a republic,
and become one of the great powers. Vergennes, soon after England had
taken Canada from France in th e Seven Years’ War, told an English
traveler: “England will soon repent of having removed the only check
that could keep her colonies in awe. They stand no longer in need of her
protection. She will call upon them to con- tribute to the burdens they
have helped to bring upon her, and they will an- swer by striking off
all dependence.” 94</p>
<p>The British Crown claimed authority to veto laws passed by the
colonial assemblies. It did not often use that power; but when the
Assembly of South Carolina, “sensible of the great social and political
danger arising from the - late for all the British Empire, and usually
its acts favored the motherland at the expense of the colonies. Its aim
was to make America a source of articles not readily produced in
England, and a market for British manufactured goods. 96 It discouraged
the growth of colonial industries that would compete with England’s. It
forbade the colonists to manufacture cloth, hats, leath er wares, or
iron products; 97 so the Earl of Chatham, otherwise so friendly to the
colonies, declared that he would not allow a single nail to be made in
America without the permission of Parliament. 98 The colonies were for-
bidden to set up steel furnaces or rolling mills.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>7°9</p>
<p>Many checks were put upon American merchants. They could ship goods
only in British vessels; they could sell tobacco, cotton, silk, coffee,
sugar, rice, and many other articles only to British dominions; they
could import goods from the European Continent only after these had
first been landed in England, had paid a port duty, and had been
transferred to British vessels. To protect the export of English woolens
to American colonies, colonial merchants were prohibited from selling
colonial woolens outside the colony that had produced them.“ A heavy tax
was laid by Parliament (1733) upon American imports of sugar or molasses
from any but British sources. The colonists, especially in
Massachusetts, evaded some of these regulations by smuggling, and by
secret selling of American products to foreign nations, even to the
French during the Seven Years’ War. Of 1,500,000 pounds of tea imported
yearly into the American colonies, only some ten per cent con- formed to
the requirement of passing through English ports. 100 Much of the
whiskey produced by the sixty-three distilleries of Massachusetts in
1750 used sugar and molasses smuggled in from the French West Indies.
101</p>
<p>In justification of the restrictions, the British pointed out that
other Euro- pean nations, to protect or reward their own people, laid
similar restraints upon their colonies; that many American products
enjoyed a virtual monop- oly of the English market through their
exemption from import dues; and that England deserved some economic
return for the cost of the protection which her navy gave to colonial
shipping, and which her armies gave to the colonists against the French
and the Indians in America. The expulsion of French power from Canada,
and of Spanish power from Florida, had freed the English from dangers
that had long troubled them. England felt war- ranted in asking America
to help her pay off the enormous debt — £ 140,- 000,000 — which Great
Britain had incurred in the Seven Years’ War. The colonists replied that
they had furnished twenty thousand troops for that war, and had
themselves incurred a debt of £ 2,500,000.</p>
<p>In any case England decided to tax the colonies. In March, 1765,
Gren- ville proposed to Parliament that all colonial legal documents,
all bills, diplo- mas, playing cards, bonds, deeds, mortgages, insurance
policies, and newspa- pers be required to bear a stamp for which a fee
would have to be paid to the British government. Patrick Henry in
Virginia, Samuel Adams in Massachu- setts, advised rejection of the tax
on the ground that by tradition — Magna Carta, the Great Rebellion
against Charles I, the “Bill of Rights”— English- men could justly be
taxed only with their consent or the consent of their au- thorized
representatives. How, then, could English colonials be taxed by a
Parliament in which they had no representation? Britons answered that
dif- ficulties of travel and communication made American representation
in Par- liament impracticable; and they pointed out that millions of
adult English- men had for centuries loyally accepted taxation by
Parliament though they had had no vote in electing it; they felt what
Americans should feel — that they were virtually represented in
Parliament, because its members con- sidered themselves as representing
the whole British Empire.</p>
<p>The colonists were not convinced. Since Parliament had retained
the</p>
<p>7 IG ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>power of taxing as the fulcrum of control over the king, so the
colonies de- fended their exclusive right to tax themselves as the only
alternative to finan- cial oppression by men whom they had never seen,
and who had never touched American soil. Lawyers evaded the requirement
to use stamped documents; some newspapers carried a death’s head where
the stamp should have appeared; Americans began to boycott British
goods; merchants can- celed orders for British products, and some
refused payment of their debts to England till the Stamp Act should be
repealed. 102 Colonial maidens pledged themselves to accept no suitors
who would not denounce the Stamp Act. 103 Popular resentment rose to the
pitch of rioting in several cities; in New York the governor (appointed
by the King) was hanged in effigy; in Boston the home of the lieutenant
governor, Thomas Hutchinson, was burned down; the distributors of the
stamps were forced, under threat of hanging, to resign their offices.
Feeling the boycott, British merchants called for a repeal of the act;
petitions were sent to the government from London, Bristol, Liverpool,
and other cities, stating that without repeal many English manufacturers
would be ruined; already thousands of workers had been dis- missed
because of lack of orders from America. Perhaps it was in recognition of
these appeals that Pitt, after a long illness, made a dramatic return to
Parlia- men t, and declared (January 14, 1766), “It is my opinion that
this kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies.” He ridiculed
the “idea that the colonies are virtually represented in the House.”
When George Grenville interrupted and implied that Pitt was encouraging
sedition, Pitt answered defiantly, “I rejoice that America has
resisted.” 104</p>
<p>On March 1 8 Lord Rockingham persuaded Parliament to repeal the stamp
tax. To appease “the King’s Friends” he added to the repeal a
“declaratory</p>
<p>The Americans resisted the new duties as disguised taxation. They had
kept the royal troops and governors under control by making them largely
dependent for their sustenance upon funds voted by the colonial
assemblies; to surrender this power of the purse to the King would be to
yield the di- rection of the American government to royal authority. The
assemblies united in urging a renewed boycott of British goods. Efforts
to collect the new duties were violently resisted. Lord North sought a
compromise by</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>7 II</p>
<p>canceling all the Townshend imposts except for a threepence-per-pound
duty on tea. The colonies relaxed their boycott, but resolved to drink
only such tea as had been smuggled in. When three ships of the East
India Com- pany tried to land 298 chests of tea at Boston, half a
hundred irate colonials, disguised as Mohawk Indians, boarded the
vessels, overpowered the crews, and emptied the cargoes into the sea
(December 16, 1773). Riots in other American ports frustrated further
efforts to bring in the company’s tea.</p>
<p>The rest of the story belongs mostly to America, but the part played
in it by British statesmen, orators, writers, and public opinion forms a
vital ele- ment in the history of England. Just as in America a numerous
and active minority called for loyalty to the mother country and its
government, so in England, while the public generally supported the
martial measures of Lord North’s ministry, a minority, represented in
Parliament by Chatham, Burke, Fox, Horace Walpole, and Wilkes, labored
for peace on terms favorable to America. Some saw in this division of
English opinion a revival of the oppo- sition between Royalists and
Parliamentarians in 1642. The Anglican Church fully supported the war
against the colonies; so did the Methodists, following Wesley’s lead;
but many other Dissenters regretted the conflict, for they remembered
that a majority of the colonists had come from Dissenting groups. Gibbon
agreed with Johnson in condemning the colonies, but David Hume, nearing
death, warned Britain that the attempt to coerce America would lead to
disaster. 105 The business interests veered to support of the King as
war orders brou ght them profits. War, Burke mourned, “is indeed become
a substitute for commerce…. Great orders for provisions and stores of
all kinds… keep up the spirits of the mercantile world, and in- duce
them to consider the American war not so much their calamity as their
resource.” 106</p>
<p>The liberals feared that the war would strengthen the Tories against
the Whigs, and the King against Parliament; one liberal, the Duke of
Richmond, thought of moving to France to escape royal despotism. 107
George III gave some excuse for such fears. He took full charge of the
war, even of its mili- tary details; Lord North and the other ministers,
often against their private judgment, obeyed the royal lead. The King
felt that if the Americans suc- ceeded England would face revolt in
other colonies, and would finally be confined to its island. The Earl of
Chatham, however, warned Parliament that the forcible suppression of
America would be a victory for the princi- ples of Charles I and James
II. On November 20, 1777, when British armies had suffered many defeats
in America, and France was sending subsidies to the colonies, Chatham,
coming to the House of Lords as if from the grave, heard with mounting
imp atience the ministerial “address from the throne,” and rose to make
one of the greatest speeches in the records of British elo- quence. Here
history and literature unite:</p>
<p>I rise, my lords, to declare my sentiments on this most solemn and
serious subject…. I cannot concur in a blind and servile address which
approves, and endeavors to sanctify, the monstrous measures that have
heaped disgrace and misfortune upon us — that have brought ruin to our
doors. This, my lords,</p>
<p>712</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>is a perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time for adulation.
The smoothness of flattery cannot now avail…. It is now necessary to
instruct the throne in the language of truth…. This, my lords, is our
duty; it is the proper function of this noble assembly, sitting upon our
honors in this House, the hereditary council of the Crown. And who is
the minister — where is the minister — that has dared to suggest to the
throne the contrary, unconstitutional language this day delivered from
it? The accustomed language from the throne has been application to
Parliament for advice…. But on this day, and in this extreme momentous
exigency, no reliance is reposed on our constitutional counsels, no
advice is asked from the sober and enlightened care of Parlia- ment, but
the Crown, from itself and by itself, declares an unalterable deter-
mination to pursue measures… dictated and forced upon us,… which have
reduced this late flourishing Empi re to ruin and contempt. “But yester
- day, and England might have stood against the world; now none so poor
to do her reverence.”…</p>
<p>My lords , you cannot conquer America…. You may swell every expense
and every effort still more extravagantly; pile and accumulate every
assistance you can buy or borrow; traffic and barter with every little
pitiful German prince that sells and sends his subjects to the
shambles…; your efforts are forever vain and impotent — doubly so from
this mercenary aid on which you rely, for it irritates, to an incurable
resentment, the minds of your enemies…. If I were an American, as I am
an Englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never
would lay down my arms — never — never- never ! 108</p>
<p>Burke used all his powers of reasoning in the effort to dissuade
Parliament and the ministry from a policy of force against America. From
1774 to 1780 he represented in Parliament the city of Bristol, whose
merchants at first opposed war with America; 109 he was also at this
time a salaried agent of the state of New York. 110 He did not, like
Chatham, deny the right of Parlia- ment to tax the colonies, and he did
not support the appeal of the colonists to abstract theories of “natural
right.” He broug ht the question down to where hardheaded men of action
could understand him: Was it practical to tax America? In his speech on
American taxation (April 19, 1774) he con- demned not only the Townshend
Acts but the threepence tax on tea; he warned that if taxes were added
to the industrial and commercial restrictions already laid upon America
the colonists would persist in a revolt that would break up the nascent
British Empire and tarnish the prestige of the Parlia- ment.</p>
<p>Beaten on this issue, he renewed, on March 22, 1775, his plea for
concilia- tion. He pointed out that trade with America had grown tenfold
between 1704 and 1 772, 111 and he asked was it wise to disrupt, perhaps
sacrifice, that commerce with war. He feared that war with the colonies
would leave Eng- land open to attack by a foreign enemy; this happened
in 1778. He agreed that American representation in Parliament was made
impracticable by the sea; opposuit natura he asked only that England
rely not upon taxation but upon voluntary grants from the colonial
assemblies; such grants might well exceed the proceeds of direct
taxation after the costs of forcible collection had been deducted.
112</p>
<p>His motion to this effect was rejected 270 to 78, but he had the
solace of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE POLITICAL DRAMA 7 1 3</p>
<p>winning to his cause the eloquence and skill of Charles James Fox; so
began a friendship cemented by the American Revolution and sundered by
the French. Gibbon called Fox’s speech of October 31, 1776, the most ma
sterly that he had ever heard, and Horace Walpole declared it “one of
his [Fox’s] finest and most animated orations.” 113 Walpole ranged
himself on the side of conciliation; he deplored the collapse of British
statesmanship under Lord North; and on September 1 1, 1 775, he wrote to
Horace Mann:</p>
<p>The Parliament is to meet on the 20th of next month and vote 26,000
sea- men. What a paragraph of blood is there! With what torments must
liberty be preserved in America! In England what can save it? Oh, mad,
mad England! What frenzy, to throw away its treasures, lay waste its
empire of wealth, and sacrifice its freedom, that its prince may be the
arbitrary lord of boundless des - erts in America, and of an
impoverished, depopulated, and thence insignificant island in Europe!
114</p>
<p>Not the fervor of Chatham, Burke, and Fox, but the victories and
diploma- cies of the colonies persuaded the English people, and then
their government, to thoughts of peace. Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga
(October 17, 1777) was the turning point; for the first time England
appreciated Chatham’s warning, “You cannot conquer America.” When France
recognized the “United States of America,” and joined in war against
England (February 6,</p>
<p>1778), the judgment of French statesmen confirmed Chatham’s, and the
weight of French arms and of a restored French navy was added to the
bur- den borne by the British nation. Lord North himself lost heart, and
begged permission to resign; the King, loading him with gifts, bade him
stay on.</p>
<p>Many prominent Englishmen now felt that only a government led by the
Earl of Chatham could win the colonies back from the French alliance to
union with England. But George would not hear of it. “I solemnly
declare,” he told North, “that nothing shall b ring me to treat
personally with Lord Chatham.” 115 The Earl came to the House of Lords
for the last time on April 7, 1778, supported by crutches and his son
William, his face ghastly with the nearness of death, his voice so weak
as to be barely heard. Again he counseled conciliation, but stood out
“against the dismemberment of this ancient and most noble monarchy” by a
grant of independence to Amer - ica. 116 The Duke of Richmond answered
that only by such a grant could America be won away from France. Chatham
tried to rise and speak again, but he collapsed in an apoplectic fit. He
died on May 11, 1778. Parliament voted him a public funeral, with a tomb
and monument in Westminster Abbey. He was, by general consent, the
greatest Englishman of his time.</p>
<p>Events hurried to complete the catastrophe that he had predicted. In
June, 1779, Spain joined France in war against England; it laid siege to
Gibraltar, and sent its fleet to share in the attack upon British
shipping. In August a combined flotilla of sixty French and Spanish
vessels entered the English Channel; England feverishly prepared to
resist invasion; sickness disabled the hostile fleet and compelled it to
retire to Brest. In March, 1780, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden united in a
“Declaration of Armed Neutrality,” which vowed to resist England’s
practice of boarding neutral vessels in</p>
<p>7*4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>search of enemy goods; soon other neutrals signed the declaration.
English search of Dutch vessels continued; it found evidence of secret
agreements between the city of Amsterdam and an American negotiator. Eng
lan d de- manded the punishment of the Amsterdam officials; the Dutch
government refused; England declared war (December, 1780). Now almost
all the Baltic and Atlantic states were allied against the England that
only recently had ruled the seas.</p>
<p>The mood of Parliament reflected the multiplication of disasters.
Resent- ment was mounting against the King’s frustration of his
minister’s desire to end the war. On April 6, 1780, John Dunning had
offered to the House of Commons a motion declaring “that the influence
of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished”;
the motion was approved by a vote of 233 to 215. On January 23, 1781,
the younger Pitt took his seat in the House; in his second speech he
denounced the war with America as “most accursed, wicked, barbarous,
cruel, unnatural, unjust, and diaboli - cal.” 117 Fox joyfully welcom ed
Pitt to the ranks of the opposition, not fore- seeing that this youth
was soon to be his strongest foe.</p>
<p>On October 19, 1781, Lord Cornwallis surrendered to Washington at
Yorktown. “Oh, God, it is all over!” exclaimed Lord North, but the King
insisted that the war must go on. In February and March, 1782, news came
that Minorca had been taken by the Spaniards, and several West Indian
islands by the French. Public meetings throughout England clamored for
peace. North’s majority in the Commons fell to twenty-two, to nineteen,
to one — on a motion “that the House could no longer repose confidence
in the present ministers” (March 15, 1782); this set an historic
precedent for Parliament’s procedure in forcing a change of ministry. On
March 1 8 No rth wrote to George III a letter telling him, in effect,
that both the royal policy toward America and the attempt to establish
the supremacy of the king over Parliament had failed.</p>
<p>Your Majesty is well apprized that in this country the Prince on the
throne cannot, with prudence, oppose the deliberate resolution of the
House of Com- mons…. The Parliament have uttered their sentiments, and
their sentiments, whether just or erroneous, must ultimately prevail.
Your Majesty… can lose no honor if you yield. 118</p>
<p>On March 20, 1782, after twelve years of patient service and
submission, Lord North resigned. George III, his spirit broken, wrote a
letter of abdi- cation, but did not send it. He accepted a ministry of
triumphant liberals: Rockingham, the Earl of Shelburne, Charles James
Fox, Burke, and Sheri- dan. When Rockingham died (July 1), Shelburne
succeeded him as first lord of the treasury. Fox, Burke, and Sheridan,
disliking Shelburne, resigned. Shelburne proceeded to arrange a treaty
of peace (Paris, November 30, 1782; Paris and Versailles, January 20 and
September 3, 1783) that surren- dered Minorca and Florida to Spain, and
Senegal to France, and acknowledged not only the independence of the
American colonies but their right to all the territory between the
Alleghenies, Florida, the Mississippi, and the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE POLITICAL DRAMA 7 1 5</p>
<p>The English people had been eager for peace, but they resented the
ces- sion of so much terrain to the colonies. Criticism of Shelburne
reached such bitterness that he submitted his resignation (February 24,
1783). As the quarrel between Shelburne and Fox had divided the liberal
Whigs into fac- tions neither of which was strong enough to control
Parliament, Fox agreed to form a coalition ministry with his old enemy
Lord North. Burke again became paymaster of the forces. Sheridan, who
was always in debt, was made secretary of the treasury. Both Fox and
Burke had for some time been studying the behavior of Englishmen in
India, and that country now re- placed America as the most urgent
problem in British politics.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ENGLAND AND INDIA</li>
</ol>
<p>The British East India Company had been reorganized in 1709 as the
“United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies.” Its
charter from the British government entitled it to a monopoly of British
trade with India. It was managed by a chairman and twenty-four directors
annually elected by a “Court of Proprietors” in wh ich every holder of £
500 or more of stock had one vote. In India the company became a mili-
tary as well as a commercial organization, and fought Dutch, French, and
native armies for pieces of the crumbling empire of the Moguls. It was
in one of these wars that Siraj-ud-daula, the Nawab (Viceroy) of Bengal,
captured Calcutta from the company, and imprisoned 146 Europeans in the
“Black Hole of Calcutta”— a room eighteen by fourteen feet, with only
two small windows; 123 of the prisoners died overnight (June 20-^21,
1756) from heat or asphyxiation.</p>
<p>Robert Clive, governor of Fort St. David, led a small force to
recapture Calcutta for the company. He joined in the plot of Mir Jafar,
a noble at Siraj-ud- daula’s court, to overthrow the Viceroy ; with nine
hundred Euro- pean and 2,300 native troops he defeated fifty thousand
men at Plassey (June 23, 1757); Siraj-ud-daula was put to death, and Mir
Jafar was set up in his place as nawab of Bengal. Clive entered the
capital, Murshidabab, as a conqueror. It seemed to him equal to London
in size and perhaps superior in wealth. In the Nawab’s treasury he saw
an incredible accumulation of ru - pees, jewels, gold, silver, and other
riches. Invited to name his reward for enthroning Mir Jafar, he asked £
160,000 for himself, £ 500,000 for his army and navy, £ 24,000 for each
member of the company’s governing board, and £ 1 ,000,000 as indemnity
for damage to the company’s property in Calcutta.</p>
<p>7 16</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Secure from competition, the company exploited with scant mercy the
natives subject to its rule. Armed with superior weapons, it made Indian
rulers pay heavily for British protection. Far from supervision by the
British government, and immune to the Ten Commandments east of Suez, its
senior officials made huge profits in trade, and returned to England as
nabobs capa- ble of buying, without serious injury to their capital, a
pocket borough or a member of Parliament.</p>
<p>Clive came home to England in 1760, aged thirty-five, expecting to
enjoy fame and wealth. He bought enough boroughs to command a bloc in
the Commons, and was himself elected from Shrewsbury. Some directors of
the East India Company, feeling that he had stolen beyond his years,
attacked him for using forged documents in dealing with Siraj-ud-daula
and Mir Ja- far; but when word reached London that native revolts,
official venality, and administrative incompetence were endangering the
position of the company in India, Clive was hurried back to Calcutta
(1765) as governor of Bengal. There he labored to stem corruption among
his aides, mutiny among his troops, and recurrent uprisings of native
rulers against the company. On August 12, 1765, he persuaded the
helpless Mogul Shah Alam to give the company full financial control of
the provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, with a population of thirty
million souls and an annual revenue of £4,000,-</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>This, and Clive’s victo ry at Plassey, created the British Empire in
India.</li>
</ol>
<p>His health shattered by two years of strife, Clive returned to
England in January, 1767. The attack upon him by company directors was
renewed, and was seconded by officials whose extortions he had checked.
News of a great famine in India, and of native attacks upon company
strongholds, shared in causing a panic in which prominent Englishmen
suffered severe losses. In 1772 two parliamentary committees
investigated Indian affairs, and revealed such e xactions and cruelties
that Horace Walpole cried out: “We have outdone the Spaniards in Peru!
We have murdered, deposed, plun- dered, usurped. Nay, what think you of
the famine in Bengal, in which three millions perished, being caused by
a monopoly of provisions by the servants of the East India Company?” 121
In 1773 one of the investigating committees called upon Clive to account
to the House of Commons for his methods and gains in India. He admitted
nearly all the facts, defended them as warranted by local customs and
the necessities of the situation, and added that when the members came
to judge of his honor they should not forget their own. The House voted,
155 to 95, that he had received £ 2 34,000 during his first ad-
ministration of Bengal, but that he “did at the same time render great
and meritorious services to his country.” 122 A year later, aged forty
-nine, Clive killed himself (November 22, 1774).</p>
<p>In 1773 Lord North put through Parliament a regulatory act that ad-
vanced a loan of £ 1,400,000 to the company to save it [and its
parliamen- tary shareholders] from bankruptcy, and brought all
company-ruled terri- tory in India under the presidency of Bengal, which
in turn would be re- sponsible to the British government. Warren
Hastings was appointed gover- nor of Bengal.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>7*7</p>
<p>He had risen to this position from lowly origins. His mother died in
giving him birth; his father went off to adventure and death in the West
Indies. An uncle sent the boy to Westminster School, but in 1749 the
uncle died, and Warren, aged seventeen, sailed to seek fortune in India.
He enrolled as a volunteer under Clive, shared in the recapture of
Calcutta, showed diligence and ability in administration, and was
appointed to the council governing company affairs in Bengal. In 1764 he
returned to England. Four years later the directors persuaded him to
join the Council of Madras. On his way to India he met Baron Imhof and
his wife, Marion, who became Hastings’ mis - tress and then his wife. He
did well in Madras, and in 1774 he began his turbulent rule as governor
of Bengal.</p>
<p>He worked hard, but his methods were dictatorial, and some of his
meas- ures provided material for attacks upon him by Sir Philip Francis
in the Bengal Council, as later by Burke in Parliament. When Maratha
tribes re- stored Shah Alam to the Mogul throne at Delhi, and he made
over to them those districts of Kora and Allahabad which Clive had
assigned to him, Has- tings sold the districts to the Nawab of Oudh for
fifty lacs of rupes (0,- 000,000?), and assigned company troops to help
the Nawab recover the region. He allowed the Nawab to use company troops
to invade and appropriate the territory of Rohilkhand, whose chief (said
the Nawab) owed him money; the company received a large sum for these
soldiers. Has- tings’ action clearly violated orders given him by the
directors; 123 however, those directors reckoned the worth of a governor
by the money he sent back to England.</p>
<p>An Indian official, Nuncomar, accused Hastings of accepting a bribe.
Francis and other councilors credited the charge, and alleged that there
was “no species of peculation from which the Honorab le Governor has
thought it reasonable to abstain.” 124 Nuncomar was arrested on a charge
of forgery, was convicted, and was put to death (1775). Hastings was
suspected of hav- ing influenced the chief justice, Sir Elijah Impey
(formerly a fellow student at Winchester), to exact an unusually severe
penalty. In 1780 Hastings promoted Impey to an additional post bringing
£ 6,500 a year. Mutual re- crimination between Hastings and Francis led
to a duel in which Francis was seriously wounded.</p>
<p>Haidar Ali, maharajah of Mysore, thought the quarrels between
Hastings and his council offered an opportunity for expelling the
company from In- dia. Supported by the French, he attacked company
strongholds, and won some alarming victories (1780). Hastings sent
troops and money from Bengal to oppose him; Haidar Ali died (1782), but
his son Tipu Sahib car- ried on the war till his final defeat in 1792.
Probably it was to finance these campaigns that Hastings resorted to
money-raising schemes that led to his impeachment.</p>
<p>He demanded from Chait Singh, rajah of Benares, a war subsidy addi-
tional to the revenue which that district annually paid to the company.
The Rajah pleaded inability to comply. Hastings led a small force to
Benares (1781), deposed Chait Singh, and exacted double the revenue from
Chait’s</p>
<p>7 1 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>successor. — The Nawab of Oudh, remiss in his payments to the
company, explained that he could make these payments if the company
would help him compel his mother and grandmother, the begums
(princesses) of Oudh, to release to him some of the £ 2,000,000 left
them by the Nawab ’s father. The mother had already yielded him a large
sum on his promise to ask for no more; the company, over Hastings’
protest, made a like promise. Hastings advised the Nawab to ignore the
promise. He sent company troops to Fyza- bad; by torture and
near-starvation they forced the eunuch servitors of the princesses to
surrender the treasure (1781). Out of this the Nawab paid his dues to
the company. 125</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sir Philip Francis, having recovered from his wounds, re-
turned to England (1781), and expounded to the directors and to his
friends in Parliament what he considered to be the crimes of Hastings.
In 1782 the House of Commons censured Hastings and other company agents
as having “in sundry instances acted in a manner repugnant to the honor
and policy of the nation,” and ordered the directors to recall them. The
directors issued such an order, but the Court of Proprietors
countermanded it, probably be- cause the Mysore revolt was
continuing.</p>
<p>In November, 1783, Charles James Fox, as secretary of state for
foreign affairs in the coalition m inistry, offered Parliament an “India
Reform Bill” that would have put the East India Company under control of
commission- ers appointed by the ministry. Critics moaned that the bill
would give the Fox-Burke Whigs a rich well of patronage. It passed the
House, but the King sent word to the Lords that he would consider as his
enemy any man who voted for the measure; they voted against it, 95 to
76. The Commons filed a formal protest that this royal interference with
legislation was a scan- dalous breach of parliamentary privilege. The
King, claiming that the coali- tion ministry had lost the confidence of
Parliament, dismissed it (December 18, 1783), and invited William Pitt,
aged twenty-four, to form a new gov- ernment. Believing that he could
win a national election, George III dis- solved the Parliament (March
23, 1784), and ordered his agents to spread the royal wishes and plums
among the electorate to insure the return of a conservative majority.
The Parliament that assembled on May 18 was over- whelmingly for Pitt
and the King.</p>
<p>Pitt was a master of political administration and management. His
meticu- lous devotion to his task, his detailed knowledge of affairs,
his habit of care- ful reflection and prudent judgment gave him a
superiority which nearly all his fellow ministers soon conceded. Now for
the first time since Robert Walpole (for whom his son had used the term
in 1 77 3 126 ) , England had a “prime” minister, for no important
action was taken by Pitt’s colleagues without his consent. In effect he
established “cabinet government”— the as- sembled deliberation and
united responsibility of the leading ministers under one leadership.
Though Pitt had assumed office as favoring the royal au- thority, his
hard work and wide information gradually raised him to a posi- tion
where he guided rather than followed the King. After George Ill’s second
seizure (1788) it was Pitt who ruled England.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>719</p>
<p>His special acquaintance with business and finance enabled him to
restore a treasury dangerously burdened by two major wars in one
generation. Pitt had read Adam Smith; he listened to merchants and
manufacturers; he re- duced import dues, negotiated a treaty of lowered
tariffs with France (1786), and delighted industrial leaders by
declaring that manufacturers should in general be free from taxes. He
made up for this by taxing con- sumption: ribbons, gauzes, gloves, hats,
candles, couches, salt, wine, bricks, tiles, paper, windows; many houses
boarded up some windows to reduce the tax. 127 By 1788 the budget was
balanced, and England had escaped the gov- ernmental bankruptcy that was
leading France to revolution.</p>
<p>B efore the election Pitt had introduced his “First India Bill,”
which had been defeated. Now he offered a second bill: a Board of
Control appointed by the King was to manage the political relations of
the East India Company, while commercial relations and patronage were
left in company hands, sub- ject to royal veto. The bill was passed
(August 9, 1784), and governed British-Indian affairs till 1858.</p>
<p>Fox and Burke considered this arrangement a shameful surrender to a
company notorious for corruption and crime. Burke had special reasons
for dissatisfaction. His patron Lord Verney, his brother Richard Burke,
and his relative William Burke had invested in the East India Company,
and had suffered heavy losses in the fluctuations of its stock. 128 When
William Burke went to India Edmund recommended him to Sir Philip Francis
as one whom he loved tenderly; William was made a paymaster, and proved
“as corrupt as any.” 129 Francis, back in England, gave Burke and Fox
his version of Has - tings’ administration; he was one source of Burke’s
remarkable knowledge of Indian affairs. The attack upon Hastings by the
liberal Whigs was pre- sumably motivated in part by desire to discredit
and overthrow Pitt’s min - istry. 130</p>
<p>In January, 1785, Hastings resigned, and returned to England. He
hoped that his long years of administration, his restoration of the
company to sol- vency, and his rescue of British power in Madras and
Bombay would be rewarded with a pension, if not with a peerage. In the
spring of 1786 Burke asked the House of Commons for the official records
of Hastings’ rule in India. Some were refused, some were given him by
the ministers. In April he laid before the House a bill of charges
against the ex-governor of Bengal. Hastings read to the House a detailed
reply. In June Burke presented charges relating to the Rohilkhand war,
and asked for the impeachment of Hastings; the Commons refused to
prosecute. On June 13 Fox told the story of Chait Singh, and asked for
impeachment. Pitt surprised his cabinet by voting with Fox and Burke;
many of his party followed his lead, which may have been designed to
dissociate the ministry from Hastings’ fate. The motion to im - peach
was carried 1 19 to 79.</p>
<p>The prorogation of Parliament and the pressure of other issues
interrupted the drama, but it was resumed with eclat on February 7,
1787, when Sheri- dan made what Fox and Burke and Pitt called the best
speech ever heard in the House of Commons. 131 (Sheridan was offered £ 1
,000 for a corrected</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>copy of the address; he never found time to do this, and we know it
only from subdued summaries.) With all the art of a man born to the
theater, and all the fervor of a romantic spirit, Sheridan recounted the
spoliation of the begums of Oudh. After speaking for over five hours, he
demanded that Hastings be impeached. Again Pitt voted for the
prosecution; the motion was carried, 175 to 68. On February 8 the House
appointed a committee of twenty — with Burke, Fox, and Sheridan at their
head — to prepare the articles of impeachment. These were presented, and
on May 9 the House ordered “Mr. Burke, in the name of the House of
Commons,… to go to the ba r of the House of Lords and impeach Warren
Hastings, Esquire,… of high crimes and misdemeanors.” Hastings was
arrested and brought before the peers, but was released on bail.</p>
<p>After a long delay the trial began, February 13, 1788, in Westminster
Ha ll. All lovers of literature will recall Macaulay’s gorgeous
description 192 of that historic assemblage: the lords sitting in ermine
and gold as the high court of the realm; before them Hastings, pale and
ill, aged fifty-three, height five feet six inches, weight 122 pounds;
the judges under their great ear-lapping wigs; the family of the King;
the members of the House of Com- mons; the galleries crowded with
ambassadors, princesses, and duchesses; Mrs. Siddons in her stately
beauty; Sir Joshua Reynolds amid so many no- tables whom he had
portrayed; and on one side the committee, now called the “managers,”
ready to present the case for impeachment. Clerks read the charges and
Hastings’ reply. For four days, in the most powerful speech of his
career, Burke laid upon the accused an overwhelming mass of accusa-
tions. Then, on February 15, he made the historic hall ring with his
passion- ate demand:</p>
<p>I impeach Warren Hastings, Esquire, of high crimes and
misdemeanors.</p>
<p>I impeach him in the name of the Commons of Great Britain,… whose
Parliamentary trust he has betrayed….</p>
<p>I impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose laws, rights,
and liberties he has subverted, whose properties he has destroyed, whose
country he has laid waste and desolate.</p>
<p>I impeach him in the name, and by the virtue, of those eternal laws
of jus- tice which he has violated.</p>
<p>I impeach him in the name of human nature itself, which he has
cruelly out- raged, injured, and oppressed in both sexes, in every age,
rank, situation, and condition of life. 133</p>
<p>With a hundred interruptions the trial proceeded, as Burke, Fox,
Sheridan, and others told the story of Hastings’ administration. When it

<p>he orator looked when the historian called upon him the next morning.
184</p>
<p>That speech was the climax of the trial. Each of the score of charges
re- quired investigation; the lords took their time, and may have
dallied to let the effect of eloquence wear off, and let interest in the
case be diverted to other events. These came. In October, 1788, King
George went mad, quite seriously mad, borne down by the stress of the
trial and the misconduct of his son. George Augustus Frederick, Prince
of Wales, was fat, good-natured, generous, wasteful, and amorous. He had
maintained a succession of mis- tresses, and had accumulated debts which
his father or the nation paid. In 1785 he had privately married
Mrs. Maria Anne Fitzherbert, a devout Ro- man Catholic, already twice
widowed, and six years older than the Prince. The Whigs, led by Fox,
proposed to set up a regency under the Prince, who sat up through two
nights waiting for the King to be declared incompetent. George III
confused matters by having lucid intervals, in which he talked of
Garrick and Johnson, sang snatches of Handel, and played the flute. In
March, 1789, he recovered, shed his strait jacket, and resumed the forms
of The French Revolution provided another diversion from the trial.
Burke gave up the chase of Hastings and ran to the aid of Marie
Antoinette. The immoderation of his speeches ended the remains of his
popularity; he com- plained that the members of Parliament slipped away
when he began to speak. Most of the press was hostile to him; he charged
that £ 20,000 had been used in buying journalists to attack him and
defend Hastings; and un- questionably a large part of Hastings’ fortune
had been so spent. 135 It must have been no surprise to Burke when, at
last, eight years after the impeach- ment, the House of Lords acquitted
Hastings (1795). The general feeling was that the verdict was just: the
accused had in many respects been guilty, but he had saved India for
England, and had been punished by a trial that had broken his health and
his hopes and had left him tarnished in reputation and ruined in
purse.</p>
<p>Hastings survived all his accusers. The East India Company rescued
him from insolvency by voting him a gift of ,£90,000. He bought back his
family’s ancestral estate at Daylesford, restored i t, and lived in
Oriental lux- ury. In 1813, aged eighty-one, he was asked to testify on
Indian affairs be- fore the House of Commons; he was received there with
acclamation and reverence, his services remembered, his sins washed away
by time. Four years later he passed away, and of his tumultuous
generation only one re- mained — the blind and imbecile King.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ENGLAND AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>After almost exhausting himself in his war against the East India
Com- pany, Burke took on the French Revolution as his personal enemy,
and in the course of this new campaign he made a major contribution to
political philosophy.</p>
<p>He had predicted the Revolution twenty years before its coming.
“Under</p>
<p>7 22</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>such extreme straitness and distraction labors the whole of French
finances, so far does their charge outrun their supply in every
particular, that no man,… who has considered their affairs with any
degree of attention or infor- mation, but must hourly look for some
extraordinary convulsion in that whole system; the effect of which on
France, and even on all Europe, it is difficult to conjecture.” 136 In
1773 he visited France; at Versailles he saw Marie Antoinette, then
dauphine; he never forgot that vision of youthful beauty, happiness, and
pride. He formed a favorable opinion of the French nobility, and still
more of the French clergy. He was shocked by the anti- Catholic, often
antireligious, propaganda of the philosophes, and on his re- turn to
England he warned his countrymen against atheism as “the most horrid and
cruel blow that can be offered to civil society.” 137</p>
<p>When the Revolution came he was alarmed by the acclaim it received
fro m his friend Fox, who hailed the fall of the Bastille as “the
greatest event that ever happened in the world, and… the best.” 138
Radical ideas stem - ming from the campaigns of Wilkes and the Society
of Supporters of the Bill of Rights had slowly spread in England. One
obscure writer, in 1761, proposed communism as a cure for all social
ills except overpopulation, which, he feared, might cancel all attempts
to relieve poverty. 139 A Society for Commemorating the Revolution (of
1688) had been formed in 1788; its membership included prominent
clergymen and peers. At its meeting on November 4, 1789, it was so
stirred by a Unitarian preacher, Richard Price, that it sent an address
of congratulations to the National Assembly at Paris, expressing th e
hope that “the glorious example given in France” might “en - courage
other nations to assert the inalienable rights of mankind.” 140 The
message was signed by the third Earl Stanhope, president of the society
and brother-in-law of William Pitt.</p>
<p>That sermon and that message aroused Burke to fear and wrath. He was
now sixty years old, and had reached the right to be conservative. He
was religious, and owned a large estate. The French Revolution seemed to
him not only “the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the
world,” 141 but the most outrageous attack upon religion, property,
order, and law. On February 9, 1790, he told the House of Commons that
if any friend of his should concur in any measures tending to introduce
into England such democracy as was taking form in France, he would
renounce that friendship, however long established and dearly cherished.
Fox soothed the orator with his famous compliment to Burke as his best
educator; the break between the two was postponed.</p>
<p>In November, 1790, Burke published Reflections on the Revolution in
France , in the form of a letter (365 pages long) to “a gentleman in
Paris.” Leader of the liberals during the American Revolution, Burke was
now the hero of conservative England; George III expressed his delight
with his old enemy. The book became the bible of courts and
aristocracies; Catherine the Great, once the friend and darling of the
philosophes , sent her congratula- tions to the man who had set out to
dethrone them. 143</p>
<p>Burke began with a reference to Dr. Price and the Society for
Commemo-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>723</p>
<p>rating the Revolution. He deplored the entry of clergymen into
political dis- cussions; their business was to guide souls to Christian
charity, not to politi- cal reform. He had no trust in the universal
male suffrage that Price pleaded for; he thought the majority would be a
worse tyrant than a king, and that democracy would degenerate into mob
rule. Wisdom lies not in numbers but in experience. Nature knows nothing
of equality. Political equality is a “monstrous fiction, which, by
inspiring false ideas and vain expectations into men destined to travel
in the obscure walks of laborious life, serves only to aggravate that
real inequality, which it never can remove.” 143 Aristocracy is
inevitable; and the older it is, the better it will fulfill its function
of silently establishing that social order without which there can be no
stability, no security, and no liberty. 144 Hereditary monarchy is good
because it gives to government a unity and continuity without which the
legal and social rela- tions of the citizens would fall into a hectic
and chaotic flux. Religion is good, because it helps to chain those
unsocial impulses which run like sub- terranean fire beneath the surface
of civilization, and which can be con- trolled only by the constant
co-operation of state and church, law and creed, fear and reverence.
Those French philosophers who undermined religious belief in the
educated ranks of their people were foolishly loosing the reins that had
kept men from becoming beasts.</p>
<p>Burke was revolted by the triumph of the mob at Versailles over “a
mild and lawful monarch ,” treating him with “more fury, outrage, and
insult than ever any people” raised “against the most illegal usurper
and the most sanguinary tyrant.” 145 Here came the famous page that
thrilled our youth:</p>
<p>It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France,
then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this
orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw
her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere
she just began to move in — glittering like the morning star, full of
life, and splendor, and joy. Oh, what a revolution! and what a heart
must I have to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that
fall!* Little did I dream, when she added titles of ven- eration to
those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be
obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that
bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters
fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor,
and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from
their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.
But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and
calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished
forever. 146</p>
<p>Sir Philip Francis laughed at all this as romantic moonshine, and
assured Burke that the Queen of France was a Messalina and a jade. 147
So thought many patriotic Englishmen; Horace Walpole, however, affirmed
that Burke had pictured Marie Antoinette “exactly as she appeared to me
the first time I saw her when Dauphiness.” 148</p>
<ul>
<li>I.e., the compulsion laid upon Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, by
the mob at Versailles, to march back with it to Paris and to live under
popular surveillance in the Tuileries (Oct. 5-6, 1789).</li>
</ul>
<p>7 2 4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>As the Revolution proceeded Burke continued his attack with a Letter
to a Member of the National Assembly (January, 1791). In this he
suggested that the governments of Europe should unite to check the
revolt, and to restore the King of France to his traditional power. Fox
was alarmed at this proposal, and in the House of Commons, on May 6, the
friends who had fought shoulder to shoulder in so many campaigns came to
a dramatic part- ing of the ways. Fox reiterated his praise of the
Revolution. Burke rose in protest. “It is indiscreet,” he said, “at any
period, but especially at my time</p>
<p>In his writings on the French Revolution Burke gave a classical
expression to a conservative philosophy. Its first principle is to
distrust the reasoning of an individual, however brilliant, if it
conflicts with the traditions of the race. Just as a child cannot
understand the reasons for parental cautions and pro- hibitions, so the
individual, who is a child compared with the race, cannot always
understand the reasons for customs, conventions, and laws that em- body
the experience of many generations. Civilization would be impossible “if
the practice of all moral duties, and the foundations of society,
rested</p>
<p>So the second element of conservatism is “prescription”: a tradition
or an institution should be doubly reverenced and rarely changed if it
is already written or embodied in the order of the society or the
structure of the gov- ernment. Private property is an example of
prescription and of the apparent irrationality of wisdom: it seems
unreasonable that one family should own so much, another so little, and
even more unreasonable that the owner should be allowed to transmit his
property to successors who have not lifted a hand to earn it; yet
experience has found that men in general will not bestir them- selves to
work and study, or to laborious and expensive preparation, unless they
may call the results of their efforts their own property, to be trans-
mitted, in large measure, as they desire; and experience has shown that
the possession of property is the best guarantee for the prudence of
legislation and the continuity of the state.</p>
<p>A state is not merely an association of persons in a given space at a
given moment; it is an association of individuals through extensiv e
time. “Society is indeed a contract,… a partnership not only between
those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are
dead, and those who are to be born”; 151 that continuity is our country.
In this triune whole a present majority may be a minority in time; and
the legislator must consider the rights of the past (through
“prescription”) and of the future as well as</p>
<p>CHAP, XXVIII )</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>7 2 5</p>
<p>hose of the living present. Politics is, or should be, the art of
adjusting the aims of clashing minorities with the good of the
continuing group. More- over, there are no absolute rights; these are
metaphysical abstractions un- known to nature; there are only desires,
powers, and circumstances; and “circumstances give to every political
principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect.” 152
Expediency is sometimes more important than rights. “Politics ought to
be adjusted not to [abstrac t] human reasonings but to human nature, of
which the reason is but a part, and by no means the greatest part.” 153
“We must make use of existing materials.” 154</p>
<p>All these considerations are illustrated by religion. The doctrines,
myths, and ceremonies of a religion may not conform to our present
individual reason, but this may be of minor moment if they comport with
the past, present, and presumed future needs of society. Experience
dictates that the passions of men can be controlled only by the
teachings and observances of religion. “If we should uncover our
nakedness [release our instincts] by throwing off that Christian
religion which has been… one great source of civilization amongst us,…
we are apprehensive (being well aware that the mind will not endure a
void) that some uncouth, pernicious, and degrad- ing superstition might
take place of it.” 155</p>
<p>Many Englishmen rejected Burke’s conservatism as a cult of
stagnation, 156 and Thomas Paine answered him vigorously in The Rights
of Man (1791-</p>
<p>92). But the England of Burke’s old age generally welcomed his
ancestor worship. As the French Revolution went on to the September
Massacres, the execution of the King and the Queen, and the Reign of
Terror, the great majority of Britons felt that Burke had well predicted
the results of revolt and irreligion; and for a full century England,
though eliminating her rotten boroughs and widening her suffrage, kept
resolutely to its constitution of king, aristocracy, Established Church,
and a Parliament thinking in terms of imperial powers rather than of
popular rights. After the Revolution France returned from Rousseau to
Montesquieu, and Joseph de Maistre rephrased Burke for the repentant
French.</p>
<p>Burke continued to the end his campaign for a holy war, and he
rejoiced when France declared war on Great Britain (1793). George III
wished to reward his old enemy for recent services with a peerage, and
with that title of Lord Beaconsfield which Disraeli later graced; Burke
refused, but ac- cepted a pension of £ 2,500 (1794). When talk arose of
negotiations with France, he issued four Letters on a Regicide Peace
(1797 f.), passionately demanding that the war go on. Only death cooled
his fire (July 8, 1797). Fox proposed that he be buried in Westminster
Abbey, but Burke had left instructions that he should have a private
funeral and be interred in the little church at Beaconsfield. Macaulay
thought him the greatest Englishman since Milton — which may have
slighted Chatham; and Lord Morley more prudently called him “the
greatest master of civil wisdom in our tongue” 157 — which may have
slighted Locke. In any case Burke was what conservatives had longed for
in vain throughout the Age of Reason — a man who could defend custom as
brilliantly as Voltaire had defended reason.</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE HEROES RETIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>As the French Revolution advanced, Charles James Fox found himself in
a diminishing minority in Parliament and in the country. Many of his
allies were won to the view that England must join Prussia and Austria
in fighting France. After the execution of Louis XVI Fox himself
turned</p>
<p>against the Revolution, but he still opposed entry into the war. When
war came nevertheless, he consoled himself by drinking, by reading the
classics, and by marrying (1795) his (and Lord Cavendish’s, Lord
Derby’s, and</p>
<p>Lord Cholmondeley’s) former mistress, Mrs. Elizabeth Armstead, who
paid his debts. 158 He welcomed the Peace of Amiens (1802), traveled in
France, was acclaimed there with civic and popular honors, and was
received by Napoleon as a patriot of civilization. In 1806 he served as
foreign secretary in a “Ministry of All the Talents”; he labored to keep
the peace with France, and decisively supported Wilberforce’s campaign
against the slave trade. When he learned of a plot to assassinate
Napoleon he sent the Emperor a warning through Talleyrand. Had Fox’s
health not broken do wn, he might have found a means of reconciling
Bonaparte’s ambition with England’s se - curity. But in July, 1 806, he
was disabled by dropsy. A succession of painful operations failed to
stay the progress of the disease; he made his peace with the Established
Church, and on September 13 he died, mourned by his friends and his
enemies, and even by the King. He was the most widely loved man of his
time.</p>
<p>The younger Pitt, prematurely old, preceded him to the Abbey’s
vaults. He too found that he could bear the pace of political life only
through the occasional amnesia of drink. The precarious sanity of George
III was a con- stant problem; any serious conflict of views between King
and minister might throw the crowned head out of balance and bring in a
regency by the Prince of Wales, who would sack Pitt and call in Fox. So
Pitt abandoned his plans for political reform, and withdrew his
opposition to the slave trade, when he found that on these, as on many
other matters, George was fretfully resolved to perpetuate the past.
Pitt concentrated his genius on economic legislation, in which he served
the rising middle class. Much to his distaste, he led England in war
against what he called “a nation of atheists.” 159 He did not do well as
a war minister. Fearing a French invasion of Ireland, he tried to
appease the Irish with a program of parliamentary union and Catholic
emancipation; the King balked, and Pitt resigned (1801). He returned
(1804) to head his second ministry; Napoleon proved too much for him;
and when the news came of the French victory at Austerlitz (December
2,</p>
<p>1805), which made Napoleon master of the Continent, Pitt broke down
in body and spirit. Seeing a large map of Europe, he bade a friend,
“Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years.” 160 He died
January 23, 1806, honorably poor, and only forty-six years old.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl)</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL DRAMA</p>
<p>727</p>
<p>Life took longer to destroy Sheridan. He had joined with Burke and
Fox in the defense of America and the battle of Hastings; he supported
Fox in applauding the French Revolution. Meanwhile that wife whose charm
and gentle nature were favorite themes among his friends, and who had
put her beauty on the hustings to help him win a seat in Parliament,
died of tubercu- losis in her thirty- eighth year (1792). Sheridan broke
down. “I have seen him,” said an acquaintance, “night after night cry
like a child.” 161 He found some consolation in the daughter she had
borne him; but she died in the same year. During those months of grief
he faced the task of rebuilding the Drury Lane Theatre, which had become
too old and weak for safety; and to finance this operation he incurred
heavy liabilities. He had accustomed himself to luxurious living, which
his income could not maintain; he borrowed to con- tinue that style.
When his creditors came to dun him he treated them like lords,
entertained them with liquor, courtesy, and wit, and sent them away in a
humor that almost forgot his debts. He remained active in Parliament
till 1812, when he failed of re-election. As a member of the House he
had been immune to arrest; now his creditors closed in upon him,
appropriated his books, his pictures, his jewels; finally they were
about to carry him off to jail when his physician warned them that
Sheridan might die on the way. He succumbed on July 7, 1816, in his
sixty-fifth year. He was rich again in his funeral, for seven lords and
one bishop bore him to the Abbey.</p>
<p>The half-mad King survived them all, survived even the triumph of
Eng- land at Waterloo, though he knew it not. By 1783 he recognized that
he had failed in his attempt to make the ministers responsible to him
rather than to Parliament. The long struggles with the House of Commons,
with America, and with France proved too much for him, and in 1801,
1804, and 1810 he relapsed into insanity. In his old age the people came
to recognize his cour- age and his sincerity, and the popularity that
had been denied him in his days of strife came to him at last, tinged
with pity for a man who had seen Eng- land suffer so many defeats and
was not permitted to witness her victory. The death of his favorite
daughter, Amelia (1810), completed his divorce from reality; in 1811 he
became incurably insane as well as blind, and he remained in seclusion,
under guard, till his death (January 29, 1820).</p>
