<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>The Art of Periclean Greece</p>
<p>I. THE ORNAMENTATION OF LIFE</p>
<p>“T</p>
<p>X T is beautiful,” says a character in Xenophon’s EconomtcSy</p>
<p>to see the footgear ranged in a row according to its kind;
beautiful</p>
<p>to see garments sorted according to their use, and coverlets;
beau-</p>
<p>tiful to see glass vases and tableware so sorted; and beautiful,
too,</p>
<p>despite the jeers of the witless and flippant, to see
cooking-pots</p>
<p>arranged with sense and symmetry. Yes, all things without excep-</p>
<p>tion, because of symmetry, will appear more beautiful when placed in
order. All these utensils will then seem to form a choir; the</p>
<p>center which they unite to form will create a beauty that wfll be</p>
<p>enhanced by the distance of the other objects in the group.’</p>
<p>This passage from a general reveals the scope, simplicity, and
strength of the esthetic sense in Greece. The feeling for form and
rhythm, for precision and clarity, for proportion and order, is the
central fact in Greek culture; it enters into the shape and ornament of
every bowl and vase, of every statue and painting, of every temple and
tomb, of every poem and drama, of all Greek work in science and
philosophy. Greek art is rea- son made manifest: Greek painting is the
logic of line, Greek sculpture is a worship of symmetry, Greek
architecture is a marble geometry. There is no extravagance of emotion
in Periclean art, no bizarrerie of form, no striving for novelty through
the abnormal or unusual;* the purpose is not to represent the
indiscriminate irrelevancy of the real, but to catch the il- luminating
essence of things, and to portray the ideal possibilities of men. The
pursuit of wealth, beauty, and knowledge so absorbed the Athenians that
they had no time for goodness. “I swear by all the gods,” says one of
Xenophon’s banqueters, “that I would not choose the power of the Persian
lang in preference to beauty.”*</p>
<p>The Greek, whatever the romanticists of less virile ages may have
fancied of him, was no effeminate esthete, no flower of ecstasy
murmuring mys-</p>
<ul>
<li>FbUokdoumen mef euteleias, says Thucydides’ Pericles: “We love
beauty without ex - travagance.”*</li>
</ul>
<p>3*3</p>
<p>3*4 the life of GREECE (CHAF. XIV</p>
<p>teries of art for art’s sake; he thought of art as subordinate to
life, and of living as the greatest art of all; he had a healthy
utilitarian bias against any beauty that could not be used; the useful,
the beautiful, and the good were almost as closely bound together in his
thought as in the Socratic philoso- phy.* In his view art was first of
all an adornment of the ways and means of life: he wanted his pots and
pans, his lamps and chests and tables and beds and chairs to be at once
serviceable and beautiful, and never too ele- gant to be stron g. Having
a vivid “sense of the state,” he identified him - self with the power
and glory of his city, and employed a thousand artists to embellish its
public places, ennoble its festivals, and commemorate its history. Above
all, he wished to honor or propitiate the gods, to express his gratitude
to them for life or victory; he offered votive images, lavished his
resources upon his temples, and engaged statuaries to give to his gods
or his dead an enduring similitude in stone. Hence Greek art belonged
not to a museum, where men might go to contemplate it in a rare moment
of esthetic conscience, but to the actual interests and enterprises of
the people; its “Apollos” were not dead marbles in a gallery, but the
likenesses of beloved deities; its temples no mere curiosities for
tourists, but the homes of living gods. The artist, in this society, was
not an insolvent recluse in a studio, working in a language alien to the
common citizen; he was an artisan toiling with laborers of all degrees
in a public and intelligible task. Athens brought together, from all the
Greek world, a greater concourse of artists, as well as of philosophers
and poets, than any other city except Renaissance Rome; and these men,
competing in fervent rivalry and co- operating under enlightened
statesmanship, realized in fair measure the vision of Pericles.</p>
<p>Art begins at home, and with the person; men paint themselves before
they paint pictures, and adorn their bodies before building homes.
Jewelry, like cosmetics, is as old as history. The Greek was an expert
cutter and engraver of gems. He used simple tools of bronze — plain and
tubular drills, a wheel, and a polishing mixture of emery powder and
oil;’ yet his work was so delicate and minute that a microscope was
probably required in executing the details, and is certainly needed in
following them.® Coins were not especially pretty at Athens, where the
grim owl ruled the mint. Elis led all the mainland in this field, and
towards the close of the fifth century Syracuse issued a dekadrachma
that has never been surpassed in numismatic art. In metalwork the
masters of Chalcis maintained their leadership; every Mediterranean city
sought their iron, copper, and silver wares. Greek mirrors were more
pleasing than mirrors by</p>

<li>“Among the ancients,” said Stendhal, “the beaudful is only the high
relief of the usefoL”*</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 315</p>
<p>their nature can frequently be; for though one might not see the
clearest of reflections in the polished bronze, the mirrors themselves
were of varied and attractive shapes, often elaborately engraved, and
upheld by figures of heroes, fair women, or gods.</p>
<p>The potters carried on the forms and methods of the sixth century,
with their traditional banter and rivalry. Sometimes they burnt into the
vase a word of love for a boy; even Pheidias followed this custom when
he carved upon the finger of his Zeus the words, “Pantarkes is fair.”^
In the first half of the</p>

<li>THE RISE OF PAINTING</li>
</ol>
<p>Four stages vaguely divide the history of Greek painting. In the skth
cen- tury it is chiefly ceramic, devoted to the adornment of vases; in
the fifth it is chiefly architectural, giving color to public buildings
and statues; in the fourth it hovers between the domestic and the
individual, decorating dwellings and making portraits; in the
Hellenistic Age it is chiefly individual, producing easel pictures for
private purchasers. Greek painting begins as an offshoot of draw- ing,
and remains to the end a matter essentially of drawing and design. In
its</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>316</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>development it uses three methods: fresco, or painting upon wet
plaster; tem- pera, or painting upon wet cloth or boards with colors
mixed with the white of eggs; and encaustic, which mixed the colors with
melted wax; this is as near as antiquity comes to painting in oils.
Pliny, whose will to believe sometimes rivals that of Herodotus, assures
us that the art of painting was already so ad- vanced in the eighth
century that Candaules, King of Lydia, paid its weight in gold for a
picture by Bularchus;® but all beginnings are mysteries. We may judge
the high repute of painting in Greece from the fact that Pliny gives it
more space than to sculpture; and apparently the great paintings of the
classic and Hellenistic periods were as much discussed by the critics,
and as highly regarded by the people, as the most distinguished
specimens of architecture or statuary.“*</p>
<p>Polygnbtus of Thasos was as famous in fifth-century Greece as Ictinus
or Pheidias. We find him in Athens about 472; perhaps it was the rich
Cimon who procured him commissions to adorn several public buildings
with murals.* Upon the Stoa, which thereafter was called Poecile^ or the
Painted Portico, and which, three centuries later, would give its name
to the philosophy of Zeno, Polygnotus depicted the Sack of Troy — not
the bloody massacre of the night of victory, but the somber silence of
the morning after, with the victors quieted by the ruin around them, and
the defeated lying calm in death. On the walls of the temple of the
Dioscuri he painted the Rape of the Leucippidae, and set a precedent for
his art by portraying the women in transparent drapery. The Amphictyonic
Council was not shocked; it invited Polygnotus to Delphi, where, in the
Lesche, or Lounge, he painted Odysseus in Hades, and another Sack of
Troy. All these were vast frescoes, almost empty of landscape or
background, but so crowded with individualized figures that many
assistants were needed to fill in with color the master’s carefully
drawn designs. The Lesche mural of Troy showed Menelaus’ crew about to
spread sail for the return to Greece; in the center sat Helen; and
though many other women were in the picture, all appeared to be gazing
at her beauty. In a comer stood Andromache, with Astyanax at her breast;
in another a little boy clung to an altar in fear; and in the distance a
horse rolled around on the sandy beach.“* Here, half a century before
Euripides, was all the drama of The Trojan Women. Polygnotus refused to
take pay for these pictures, but gave them to Athens and Delphi out of
the generosity of confident strength. All Hellas acclaimed him: Athens
conferred citizenship upon him, and the Amphictyonic Council arranged
that wherever he went in Greece he should be (as Socrates wished to be)
maintained at the public expense.“ All that remains of him is a little
pigment on a wall at Delphi to remind us that artistic immortality is. a
moment in geological time.</p>
<p>• He repaid Cimon by making love to his sister Elpinice, and painting
her portrait as Laodicea among the women of Troy.“</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 317</p>
<p>About 470 Delphi and Corinth established quadrennial contests in
paint- ing as part of the Pythian and Isthmian games. The art was now
sufficiently advanced to enable Panaenus, brother (or nephew) of
Pheidias, to make recognizable portraits of the Athenian and Persian
generals in his Battle of Marathon. But it still placed all figures in
one plane, and made them of one stature; it indicated distance not by a
progressive diminution of size and a modeling with light and shade, but
by covering more of the lower half of the farther figures with the
curves thatpepresented the ground. Towards 440 a vital step forward was
takefi. Agatharchus, employed by Aeschylus and Sophocles to paint
scenery for their plays, perceived the connection between light and
shade and distance, and wrote a treatise on perspective as a means of
creating theatrical illusion. Anaxagoras and Democritus took up the idea
from the scientific angle, and at the end of the century ApoUo- dorus of
Athens won the name of skiagraphos^ or shadow painter, because he made
pictures in chiaroscuro — i.e., in light and shade; hence Pliny spoke of
him as “the first to paint objects as they really appeared.’”*</p>
<p>Greek painters never made full use of these discoveries; just as
Solon frowned upon the theatrical art as a deception, so the artists
seem to have thought it against their honor, or beneath their dignity,
to give to a plane surface the appearance of three dimensions.
Nevertheless it was through perspective and chiaroscuro that Zeuxis,
pupil of Apollodorus, made him- self the supreme figure in fifth-century
painting. He came from Heracleia (Pontica? ) to Athens about 424; and
even amid the noise of war his coming was considered an event. He was a
“character,” bold and conceited, and he painted with a swashbuckling
brush. At the Olympic games he strutted about in a checkered tunic on
which his name was embroidered in gold; he could afford it, since he had
already acquired “a vast amount of wealth” from his paintings.“ But he
worked with the honest care of a great artist, and when Agatharchus
boasted of his own speed of execution, Zeuxis said quietly, “I take a
long time.”” He gave away many of his masterpieces, on the ground that
no price could do them justice; and cities and kings were happy to
receive them.</p>
<p>He had only one rival in his generation — Parrhasius of Ephesus,
almost as great and quite as vain. Parrhasius wore a golden crown on his
head, called himself “the prince of painters,” and said that in him the
art had reached per - fection.” He did it all in lusty good humor,
singing as he painted.” Gossip said that he had bought a slave and
tortured him to study facial expression in pain for a picture of
Prometheus;” but people tell many stories about artists. Like 2 ^uxis he
was a realist; his Runner was portrayed with such verisimili-</p>

<p>(chap XIV</p>
<p>tude that those who beheld it expected the perspiration to fall from
the pic- ture, and the athlete to drop from exhaustion. He drew an
immense muraL^ of The People of Athens, representing them as implacable
and merciful, proud and humble, fierce and timid, fickle and generous —
and so faithfully that the Athenian public, we are informed, realized
for the first time its own complex and contradictory character.”</p>
<p>A great rivalry brought him into public competition with Zeuxis. The
latter painted some grapes so naturally that birds tried to eat them.
The judges were enthusiastic about the picture, and Zeuxis, confident of
victory, bade Parrhasius draw aside the curtain that concealed the
Ephesian’s paint - ing. But the curtain proved to be a part of the
picture, and Zeuxis, hav- ing himself been deceived, handsomely
acknowledged his defeat. Zeuxis suffered no loss of reputation. At
Crotona he agreed to paint a Helen for the temple of Lacinian Hera, on
condition that the five loveliest women of the city should pose in the
nude for him, so that he might select from each her fairest feature, and
combine them all in a second goddess of beauty.” Penelope, too, found
new life under his brush; but he admired more his portrait of an
athlete, and wrote under it that men would find it easier to criticize
him than to equal him. All Greece enjoyed his conceit, and talked about
him as much as of any dramatist, statesmen, or general. Only the prize
fighters outdid his fame.</p>
<p>ra. THE MASTERS OF SCULPTURE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Methods</li>
</ol>
<p>None the less painting remained slightly alien to the Greek genius,
which loved form more than color, and made even the painting of the
classic age (if we may judge it from hearsay) a statuesque study in line
and design rather than a sensuous seizure of the colors of life. The
Hellene delighted rather in sculpture: he filled his home, his temples,
and his graves with terra- cotta statuettes, worshiped his gods with
images of stone, and marked the tombs of his departed with stelae
reliefs that are among the commonest and most moving products of Greek
art. The artisans of the stelae were simple workers who carved by rote,
and repeated a thousand times the familiar theme of the quiet parting,
with clasped hands, of the living from the dead. But the theme itself is
noble enough to bear repetition, for it shows classic restraint at its
best, and teaches even a romantic soul that feeling speaks</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 319</p>
<p>with most power when it lowers its voice. These slabs show us the
dead most often in some characteristic occupation of life — a child
playing with a hoop, a girl carrying a jar, a warrior proud in his
armor, a young woman admiring her jewels, a boy reading a book while his
dog lies content but watchful under his chair. Death in these stelae is
made natural, and there- fore forgivable.</p>
<p>More complex, and supreme in their kind, are the sculptural reliefs
of this age. In one of them Orpheus bids a lingering farewell to
Eurydice, whom Hermes has reclaimed for the nether world;“** in another
Demeter gives to Trip- tolemus the golden grain by y which he is to
establish agriculture in Greece; here some of the coloring still adheres
to the stone, and suggests the warmth and brilliance of Greek relief in
the Golden Age.<em>® Still more beautiful is The Birth of Aphrodite,
carved on one side of the “Ludovisi Throne”</em> by an un - known
sculptor of presumably Ionian training. Two goddesses are raising
Aphrodite from the sea; her thin wet garment clings to her form and
reveals it in all the splendor of maturity; the head is semi- Asiatic,
but the drapery of the attendant deities, and the soft grace of their
pose, bear the stamp of the sensitive Greek eye and hand. On ano ther
side of the “throne” a nude girl plays the double flute. On a third side
a veiled woman prepares her lamp for the evening; perhaps the face and
garments here are even nearer to perfection than on the central
piece.</p>
<p>The advance of the fifth-century sculptor upon his forebears is
impressive. Frontality is abandoned, foreshortening deepens perspective,
stillness gives place to movement, rigidity to life. Indeed, when Greek
statuary breaks through the old conventions and shows man in action, it
is an artistic revolu- tion; rarely before, in Egypt or the Near East,
or in pre-Marathon Greece, has any sculpture in the round been caught in
action. These developments owe much to the freshened vitality and
buoyancy of Greek life after Salamis, and more to the patient study of
motile anatomy by master and apprentice through many generations. “Is it
not by modeling your works on living beings,” asks Socrates, sculptor
and philosopher, “that you make your statues appear alive? . . . And as
our different attitudes cause the play of certain muscles of our body,
upwards or downwards, so that some are contracted and some stretched,
some wrung and some relaxed, is it not by expressing these efforts that
you give greater truth and verisimilitude to your works? The Periclean
sculptor is interested in every feature of the</p>

<p>He uses almost any workable material that comes to his hand — wood,
ivory, bone, terra cotta, limestone, marble, silver, gold; sometimes, as
in the chryselephantine statues of Pheidias, he uses gold on the raiment
and ivory for the flesh. In the Peloponnesus bronze is the sculptor’s
favorite material, for he admires its dark tints as well adapted to
represent the bodies of men tanned by nudity under the sun; and — not
knowing the rapacity of man — he dreams that it is more durable than
stone. In Ionia and Attica he prefers marble; its difficulty stimulates
him, its firmness lets him chisel it safely, its translucent smoothness
seems designed to convey the rosy color and deli- cate textu re of a
woman’s skin. Near Athens the sculptor discovers the marble of Mt.
Pentelicus, and observes how its iron content mellows with time and
weather into a vein of gold glowing through the stone; and with the
obstinate patience that is half of genius he slowly carves the quarries
into living statuary. When he works in bronze the fifth-century sculptor
uses the method of hollow casting by the process of cire perdu, or lost
wax: i.e., he makes a model in plaster or clay, overlaps it with a thin
coat of wax, covers it all with a mold of plaster or clay perforated at
many points, and places the figure in a furnace whose heat melts the
wax, which runs out through the holes; then he pours molten bronze into
the mold at the top till the metal fills all the space before occupied
by the wax; he cools the figure, removes the outer mold, and files and
polishes, lacquers or paints or gilds, the bronze into the final form.
If he prefers marble he begins with the un- shaped block, unaided by any
system of pointing;* he works freehand, and • A method of indicating the
depth to which, at various points, a block of sculptural ma - terial is
to be cut by a carver before the artist takes it in hand. This process
came into use in Hellenistic Greece.®</p>

<p>for the most part guides himself by the eye instead of by
instruments;* blow by blow he removes the superfluous until the
perfection that he has con- ceived takes shape in the stone, and, in
Aristotle’s phrase, matte r becomes form.</p>
<p>His subjects range from gods to animals, but they must all be
physically admirable; he has no use for weaklings, for intellectuals,
for abnormal types, or for old women or men. He does well with the
horse, but indifferently with other animals. He does better with women,
and some of his anony- mous masterpieces, like the meditative young lady
holding her robe on her breast in the Athens Museum, achieve a quiet
loveliness that does not lend itself to words. He is at his best with
athletes, for these he admires without stint, and can observe without
hindrance; now and then he exaggerates their prowess, and crosses their
abdomens with incredible muscles; but despite this fault he can cast
bronzes like that found in the sea near Anticythera, and alternatively
named an Ephebos, or a Terseus whose hand once held Medusa’s snake
-haired head. Sometimes he catches a youth or a girl ab- sorbed in some
simple and spontaneous action, like the boy drawing a thorn from his
foot.* But his count ry’s mythology is still the leading inspiration of
his art. That terrible conflict between philosophy and religion which
runs through the thought of the fifth century does not show yet on the
monuments; here the gods are still supreme; and if they are dying they
are nobly transmuted into the poetry of art. Does the sculptor who
shapes in bronze the powerful 2.eus of Artemisiumf really hglieve that
he is model- ing the Law of the World? Does the artist who carves the
gentle and sor- rowful Dionysus of the Delphi Museum know, in the depths
of his inarticu- late understanding, that Dionysus has been shot down by
the arrows of philosophy, and that the traditional features of Dionysus’
successor, Christ, are already previsioned in this head?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Schools</li>
</ol>
<p>K Greek sculpture achieved so much in the fifth century, it was in
part because each sculptor belonged to a school, and had his place in a
long lineage of masters and pupils carrying on the skills of their art,
checking the extravagances of independent individualities, encouraging
their specific abilities, disciplining them -with a sturdy grounding in
the technology and achievements of the past, and forming them, through

<p>and law, into a greater art than often conies to genius isolated and
unruled. Great artists are more frequently the culmination of a
tradition than its overthrow; and though rebels are the necessary
variants in the natural his- tory of art, it is only when their new line
has been steadied with heredity and chastened with time that it
generates supreme personalities.</p>
<p>Five schools performed this function in Periclean Greece: those
of</p>
<p>Rhegium, Sicyon, Argos, Aegina, and Attica. About 496 another
Pythago- ras of Samos settled at Rhegium, cast a Philoctetes that won
him Mediter- ranean fame, and put into the faces of his statues such
signs of passion, pain, and age as shocked all Greek sculptors till
those of the Hellenistic period decided to imitate him. At Sicyon
Canachus and his brother Aristocles car- ried on the work begun a
century earlier by Dipoenus and Scyllis of Crete.. Gallon and Onatas
brought distinction to Aegina by their skill with bronze; perhaps it was
they who made the Aegina pediments. At Argos Ageladas organized the
transmission of sculptural technique in a school that reached its apex
in Polycleitus.</p>
<p>Coming from Sicyon, Polycleitus made himself popular in Argos by de-
signing for its temple of Hera, about 422, a gold and ivory statue of
the matron goddess, which the age ranked second only to the
chryselephantine immensities of Pheidias.* At Ephesus he joined in a
competition with Pheidias, Cresilas, and Phradmon to make an Amazon for
the temple of Artemis; the four artists were made judges of the result;
each, the story goes, named his own work best, Polycleitus’ second be
st; and the prize was given to the Sicyonian.f“ But Polycleitus loved
athletes more than women or gods. In the famous Diadumenos (of which the
best surviving copy is in the Athens Museum) he chose for representation
that moment in which the victor binds about his head the fillet over
which the judges are to place the laurel wreath. The chest and abdomen
are too muscular for belief, but the body is vividly posed upon one
foot, and the features are a definition of classic regularity.
Regularity was the fetish of Polycleitus; it was his life aim to find
and establish a canon or rule for the correct proportion of every part
in a statue; he was the Pythagoras of sculpture, seeHng a divine mathe-
matics of symmetry and form. The dimensions of any part of a perfect
body, he thought, should bear a given ratio to the dimensions of any one
part, say the index finger. The Polycleitan canon called for a round
head, broad shoulders, stocky torso, wide hips, and short legs, making
all in all a</p>

<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 32J</p>
<p>figure rather of strength than of grace. The sculptor was so fond of
his canon that he wrote a treatise to expound it, and molded a statue to
illustrate it. Probably this was the Doryphoros, or Spear Bearer, of
which the Naples Museum has a Roman copy; here again is the
brachycephalic head, the powerful shoulders, the short trunk, the
corrugated musculature overflow- ing the groin. Lovelier is the
Westmacott Ephebos of the .British Museum, where the lad has feeUngs as
well as muscles, and seems lost in a gentle medi- tation on something
else than his own strength. Through these figures the canon of
Polycleitus became for a time a law to the sculptors of the Pelopon-
nesus; it influenced even Pheidias, and ruled till Praxiteles overthrew
it with that rival canon of tall, slim elegance which survived through
Rome into the statuary of Christian Europe.</p>
<p>Myron mediated between the Peloponnesian and the Attic schools. Bom
at Eleutherae, living at Athens, and (says Pliny”) studying for a while
with Ageladas, he learned to unite Peloponnesian masculinity with Ionian
grace. What he added to all the schools was motion; he saw the athlete
not, like Polycleitus, before or after the contest, but in it; and
realized his vision so well in bronze that no other sculptor in history
has rivaled him in portray- ing the male body in action. About 470 he
cast the most famous of athletic statues — the Discobolos or Discus
Thrower* The wonder of the male frame is here complete: the body
carefully studied in all those movements of muscle, tendon, and bone
that are involved in the action; the legs and arms and trunk bent to
give the fullest force to the throw; the face not dis- torted with
effort, but calm in the confidence of ability; the head not heavy or
brutal, but that of a man of blood and refinement, who could write books
if he would condescend. This chef- d’oeuvre was only one of Myron’s
achievements; his contemporaries valued it, but ranked even more highly
his Athena and Marsyas^ and his Ladas. Athena here is too lovely for the
purpose; no one could guess that this demure virgin is watching with
calm content the flaying of the defeated flutist. Myron’s Marsyas is
George Bernard Shaw caught in an unseemly but eloquent pose; he has
played for the last time, and is about to die; but he will not die
without a speech. Ladas was an athlete who succumbed to the exhaustion
of victory; Myron por- trayed him so realistically that an old Greek,
seeing the statue, cried out: “Like as thou wert in life, O Ladas,
breathing forth thy pa nting soul, such</p>
<p>• The Museo delle Terme has the torso of a fine marble copy by a

<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>hath Myron wrought thee in bronze, stamping on all thy body thin e
eager- ness for the victor’s crown.” And of Myron’s Hei fer the Greeks
said that it could do everything but moo.”</p>
<p>The Attic or Athenian school added to the Pelopoimesians and to Myron
what woman gives to man — beauty, tenderness, delicacy, and grace; and
because in doing this it still retained a masculine element of strength,
it reached a height that sculpture may never attain again. Calamis was
still a little archaic, and Nesiotes and Critius, in casting a second
group of Tyran- nicides, did not free themselves from the rigid
simplicity of the sixth cen- tury; Lucian warns orators not to behave
like such l^eless figures. But when, about 423, Paeonius of Thracian
Mende, after studying sculpture at Athens, made for the Messenians a
Nike, or Victory, he touched heights of grace and loveliness that no
Greek would reach again until Praxiteles; and not even Praxiteles would
surpass the flow of this drapery, or the ecstasy of this motion.*</p>
<p>3 . Fheidias</p>
<p>From 447 to 438 Pheidias and his aides were absorbed in carving the
statues and reliefs of the Parthenon. As Plato was first a dramatist and
then became a dramatic philosopher, so Pheidias was first a painter and
then be- came a pictorial sculptor. He was the son of a painter, and
studied for a while under Polygnotus; from him, presumably, he learned
design and com- position, and the grouping of figures for a total
effect; from him, it may be, he acquired that “grand style” which made
him the greatest sculptor in Greece. But painting did not satisfy him;
he needed more dimensions. He took up sculpture, and perhaps studied the
bronze technique of Ageladas. Patiently he made himself master of every
branch of his art.</p>
<p>He was already an old man when, about 438, he formed his Athene</p>
<p>Parthenos, for he depicted himself on its shield as aged and bald,
and not unacquainted with grief. No one expected him to carve with his
own hands the hundreds of figures that filled the metopes, frieze, and
pediments of the Parthenon; it was enough that he superintended all
Periclean building, and designed the sculptural ornament; he left it to
his pupils, above all to Alcamenes, to execute the plans. He himself,
however, made three statues</p>
<p>• The Nike was pieced together from fragments unearthed by the
Germans at Olympia in 1890, and is now m the Olympia Museum. — Almost as
beautiful are the Nereids^ or Sea Maidens, which were found headless
among the ruins of a monument in Lycian Xanthus, and are now in the
British Museum. The Greek spirit had penetrated even into non-Greek
Asia.</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 325</p>
<p>of the city’s goddess for the Acropolis. One was commissioned by
Athenian colonists in Lemnos; it was of bronze, a little larger than
life, and so deli- cately molded that Greek critics considered this
Lemnian Athena the most beautiful of Pheidias’ works.* * * § “ Another
was the Athene Promachos, a colossal bronze representation of the
goddess as the warlike defender of her city; it stood between the
Propylaea and the Erechtheum, rose with its pedestal to a height of
seventy feet, and served as a beacon to mariners and a warning to
enemies.! The most famous of the three, the Athene Parthenos, stood
thirty-eight feet high in the interior of the Parthenon, as the virgin
goddess of wisdom and chastity. For this culminating figure Pheidias
wished to use marble, but the people would having nothing less than
ivory and gold. The artist used ivory for the visible body, and forty-
four talents (2545 lbs.) of gold for the robe;“ furthermore, he adorned
it with precious metals, and elaborate rehefs on the helmet, the
sandals, and the shield. It was so placed that on Athena’s feast day the
sun would shine through the great doors of the temple directly upon the
brilliant drapery and pallid face of the Virgin. J</p>
<p>The completion of the work brought no happiness to Pheidias, for some
of the gold and ivory assigned to him for the statue disappeared from
his studio and could not be accounted for. The foes of Pericles did not
over- look this opportunity. They charged Pheidias with theft, and
convicted him.§ But the people of Olympia interceded for him, and paid
his bail of forty (?) talents, on condition that he come to Olympia and
make a chrys- elephantine statue for the temple of Zeus;“ they were glad
to trust him with more ivory and gold. A special workshop was built for
him and his assistants near the temple precincts, and his brother
Panaenus was commissioned to decorate the throne of the statue and the
walls of the temple with paint- ings.“ Pheidias was enamored of size,
and made his seated Z.eus sixty feet high, so that when it was placed
within the temple critics complained that the god would break through
the roof if he should take it into his head to stand up. On the “dark
brows” and “ambrosial locks”” of the Thunderer, Pheidias placed a crown
of gold in the form of olive branches and leaves; in</p>

<p>t It was carried off to Constantinople about aj). 330, and appears to
have been destroyed in a riot there in 1203.”</p>
<p>If we may judge from the “Lenormant” and “Varvaka” models of this
statue that are preserved in the Athens Museum, we should not have cared
much for the Athene Parthenos, The first has a stout frame and a swollen
face, and the breast of the second is crawling with sacred snakes.</p>
<p>§ Ca. 438. There is much uncertainty about the date, and about the
sequence of events in the later years of Pheidias’ life.®*</p>

<p>the right hand he set a small statue of Victory, also in ivory and
gold; in the left hand a scepter inlaid with precious stones; on the
body a golden robe engraved with flowers; and on the feet sandals of
solid gold. The throne was of gold, ebony, and ivory; at its base were
smaller statues of Victory, Apollo, Artemis, Niobe, and Theban lads
kidnaped by the Sphinx.“ The final result was so impressive that legend
grew around it: when Pheidias had finished, we are told, he begged for a
sign from heaven in approval; where- upon a bolt of lightning struck the
pavement near the statue’s base— a sign which, like most celestial
messages, admitted of diverse interpretations.* The work was listed
among the Seven Wonders of the World, and all who could afford it made a
pilgrimage to see the incarnate god. Aemilius Paullus, the Roman who
conquered Greece, was struck with awe on seeing the colossus; his
expectations, he confessed, had been exceeded by the reality.“ Dio
Chrysostom called it the most beautiful image on earth, and added, as
Beethoven was to say of Beethoven’s music: “If one who is heavy- laden
in mind, who has drained the cup of misfortune and sorrow in life, and
whom sweet sleep visits no more, were to stand before this image, he
would forget all the griefs and troubles that befall the life of man.”“
“The beauty of the statue,” said Quintilian, “even made some addition to
the received religion; the majesty of the work was equal to the
god.”“</p>
<p>Of Pheidias’ last years there is no unchallenged account. One story
pic - tures him as returning to Athens and dying in jail;“ another lets
him stay in Elis, only to have Elis put him to death in 432;“ there is
not much to choose between these denouements. His pupils carried on his
work, and attested his success as a teacher by almost equaling him.
Agoracritus, his favorite, carved a famous Nemesis; Alcamenes made an
Aphrodite of the Gardens which Lucian ranked with the highest
masterpieces of statuary. t“ The school of Pheidias came to an end with
the fifth century, but it left Greek sculpture considerably further
advanced than it had found it. Through Pheidias and his followers the
art had neared perfection at the very moment when the Peloponnesian War
began the ruin of Athens. Technique had been mastered, anatomy was
understood, life and movement and grace had been poured into bronze and
stone. But the characteristic achievement of Pheidias was the attainment
and definitive expression of the classic style, the “grand style” of
Winckelmann: strength reconciled with beauty, feeling with restraint,
motion with repose, flesh and bone with mind and soul. Here, after five
centuries of effort, the famed “serenity” so imaginatively</p>

<p>ascribed to the Greeks was at least conceived; and the passionate and
turbu- lent Athenians, contemplating the figures of Pheidias, might see
how nearly, if only in creative sculptury, men for a moment had been
like gods.</p>

<p>During the fifth century the Doric order consolidated its conquest of
Greece. Among all the Greek temples built in this prosperous age only a
few Ionic shrines survive, chiefly the Erechtheum and the temple of Nike
Apteros on the Acropolis. Attica remained faithful to Doric, yielding to
the Ionic order only so far as to use it for the inner columns of the
Propylaea, and to place a frieze around the Theseum and the Parthenon;
perhaps a tendency to make the Doric column longer and slenderer reveals
a further influence of the Ionic style. In Asia Minor the Greeks imbibed
the Oriental love of delicate ornament, and expressed it in the complex
elaboration of the Ionic entablature, and the creation of a new and more
ornate order, the Corinthian. About 430 (as Vitruvius tells the tale) an
Ionian sculptor, Callimachus, was struck by the sight of a basket of
votive offerings, covered with a tile, which a nurse had left upon the
tomb of her mistress; a wild acanthus had grown around the basket and
the tile; and the sculptor, pleased with the natural form so suggested,
modified the Ionic capitals of a temple that he was building at Corinth,
by mingling acanthus leaves with the volutes.“ Probably the story is a
myth, and the nurse’s basket had less influence than the palm and
papyrus capitals of Egypt in generating the Corinthian style. The new
order made little headway in classic Greece; Ictinus used it for one
isolated column in the court of an Ionic temple at Phigalea, and towards
the end of the fourth century it was used for the choragic monument of
Lysicrates. Only under the elegant Romans of the Empire did this
delicate style reach its full development.</p>
<p>All the Greek world was building temples in this period. Cities
almost bank- rupted themselves in rivalry to have the fairest statuary
and the largest shrines. To her massive sixth-century edifices at Samos
and Ephesus Ionia added new Ionic temples at Magnesia, Teos, and Priene.
At Assus in the Troad Greek colonists raised an almost archaic Doric
fane to Athena. At the other end of Hellas Crotona built, about 480, a
vast Doric home for Hera; it survived till 1600, when a bishop thought
he could make better use of its stones.“ To the fifth century belong the
greatest of the temples at Poseidonia (Paestum), Segesta, Selinus, and
Acragas, and the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus. At Syracuse the
columns still stand of a temple raised to Athena by Gelon I, and partly
preserved by its transformation into a Christian church. At Bassae,
near</p>
<p>328 THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>Phigalea in the Peloponnesus, Ictinus designed a temple of Apollo
strangely different from his other masterpiece, the Parthenon; here the
Doric periptery enclosed a space occupied by a small naos and a large
open court surrounded by an Ionic colonnade; and around the interior of
this court, along the inner face of the Ionic columns, ran a frieze
almost as graceful as the Parthenon’s, and having the added virtue of
being visible.*</p>
<p>At Olympia the Elian architect Libon, a generation before the
Parthenon, raised a rival to it in a Doric shrine to Zeus. Six columns
stood at each end, thirteen on either side; perhaps too stout for
beauty, and unfortunate in their material — a coarse limestone coated
with stucco; the roof, however, was of Pcntelic tiles. Paeonius and
Alcamenes, Pausanias tells us,<em>® carved for the pediments powerful
figures</em>! portraying on the eastern gable the chariot race between
Pelops and Oenomaus, and on the western gable the struggle of Lapiths
and centaurs. The Lapiths, in Greek legend, were a mountain tribe of
Thes- saly. When Pirithous, their king, married Hippodameia, daughter of
King Oenomaus of Pisa in Elis, he invited the centaurs to the wedding
feast. The centaurs dwelt in the mountains about Pelion; Greek art
represented them as half man and half horse, possibly to suggest their
untamed woodland nature, or because the centaurs were such excellent
horsemen that each man and his mount seemed to be one animal. At the
feast these horsemen got drunk, and tried to carry off the Lapith women.
The Lapiths fought bravely for their ladies, and won. (Greek art never
tired of this story, and perhaps used it to symbolize the clearing of
the wilderness from wild beasts, and the struggle between the human and
the bestial in man.) The figures on the east pediment are archaically
stiff and still; those on the west seem hardly of the same period, for
though some of them are crude, and the hair is stylized in ancient
fashion, they are alive with action, and show a mature grasp of
sculptural grouping. Startlingly beau- tiful is the bride, a woman of no
fragile slenderness, but of a full-bodied love- liness that quite
explains the war. A bearded centaur has one arm around her waist, one
hand upon her breast; she is about to be snatched from her nuptials, and
yet the artist portrays her features in such calm repose that one
suspects him of having read Lessing or Winckelmann; or perhaps, like any
woman, she is not insensitive to the compliment of desire. Less
ambitious and massive, but more delicately finished, are the extant
metopes of the temple, recounting cer- tain labors of Heracles; one,
wherein Heracles holds up the world for Atlas, stands out as a work of
complete mastery. Heracles here is no abnormal giant, rock-ribbed with
musculature, but simply a man of full and harmonious devel- opment.
Before him is Atlas, whose head would adorn the shoulders of Plato. At
the left is one of Atlas’ daughters, perfect in the natural beauty of

<p>womanhood; perhaps the artist had some symbolism in mind when he
showed her gently helping the strong man to bear the weight of the
world. The spe- cialist finds some faults of execution and detail in
these half-ruined metopes; but to an amateur observer the bride, and
Heracles, and the daughter of Adas, are as near to perfection as
anything in the history of sculptural relief.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Reconstruction oj Athens</li>
</ol>
<p>Attica leads all Greece in the abundance and excellence of its
fifth-cen- tury building. Here the Doric style, which tends elsewhere to
a bulging corpulence, takes on Ionian grace and elegance; color is added
to line, orna- ment to symmetry. On a dangerous headland at Sunium those
who risked the sea raised to Poseidon a shrine of which eleven columns
stand. At Eleusis Ictinus designed a spacious temple to Demeter, and
under Pericles’ persua - sion Athens contributed funds to make this
edifice worthy of the Eleusinian festival. At Athens the proximity of
good marble on Mt. Pentelicus and in Paros encouraged the artist with
the finest of building materials. Seldom, until our periods of economic
breakdown, has a democracy been able or willing to spend so lavishly on
public construction. The Parthenon cost seven hundred talents
(,200,000); the Athene Parthenos (which, how- ever, was a gold reserve
as well as a statue) cost ,000,000; the unfinished Propylaea, ,400,000;
minor Periclean structures at Athens and the Piraeus, 8,000,000;
sculpture and other decoration, 6,200,000; altogether, in the sixteen
years from 447 to 43 1, the city of Athens voted 7,600,000 for public
buildings, statuary, and painting.“ The spread of this sum among
artisans and artists, executives and slaves, had much to do with the
pros- perity of Athens under Pericles.</p>
<p>Imagination can picture vaguely the background of this courageous ad-
venture in art. The Athenians, on their return from Salamis, found their
city almost wholly devastated by the Persian occupation; every edifice
of any value had been burned to the ground. Such a calamity when it does
not destroy the citizens as well as the city, makes them stronger; the
“act of God” clears away many eyesores and unfit habitations; chance
accomplishes what human obstinacy would never allow; and if food can be
found through the crisis, the labor and genius of men create a finer
city than be- fore. The Athenians, even after the war with Persia, were
rich in both labor and genius, and the spirit of victory doubled their
will for great enterprise. In a generation Athens was rebuUt; a new
council chamber rose, a new</p>
<p>330 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>prytaneum, new homes, new porticoes, new walls of defense, new
wharves and warehouses at a new port. About 446 Hippodamus of Miletus,
chief town-planner of antiquity, laid out a new Piraeus, and set a new
style, by replacing the old chaos of haphazard and winding alleys with
broad, straight streets crossing at right angles. On an elevation a mile
northwest of the Acropolis unknown artists raised that smaller Parthenon
known as the Theseum, or temple of Theseus.* Sculptors filled the
pediments with statuary and the metopes with reliefs, and ran a frieze
above the inner columns at both ends. Painters colored the moldings, the
triglyphs, metopes, and frieze, and made bright murals for an interior
dimly lit by light shining through marble tiles.!</p>
<p>The finest work of Pericles’ builders was reserved for the Acropolis,
the ancient seat of the city’s government and faith. Themi stocles began
its re- construction, and planned a temple one hundred feet long, known
there- fore as the Hecatompedon. After his fall the work was abandoned;
the oligarchic party opposed it on the ground that any dwelling for
Athena, if it was not to bring bad luck to Athens, must be built upon
the site of the old temple of Athene Polias (i.e., Athena of the City),
which the Persians had destroyed. Pericles, caring nothing about
superstitions, adopted the site of the Hecatompedon for the Parthenon,
and, though the priests pro- tested to the end, went on with his plans.
On the southwestern slope of the Acropolis his artists erected an Odeum,
or Music Hall, unique in Athens for its cone-shaped dome. It offered a
handle to conservative satirists, who thenceforth referred to Pericles’
conical head as his odeion, or hall of song. The Odeum was built for the
most part of wood, and soon succumbed to time. In this auditorium
musical performances were presented, and the Dionysian dramas were
rehearsed; and there, annually, were held the con- tests instituted by
Pericles in vocal and instrumental music. The versatile statesman
himself often acted as a judge in these competitions.</p>
<p>The road to the summit, in classical days, was devious and gradual,
and was flanked with statues and votive offerings. Near the top was a
majes- tically broad flight of marble steps, buttressed with bastions on
either side. •The name is a mistake, since this temple, erected in 425,
could not have been the Theseum to which, in 469, Cimon brought the
supposed bones of Theseus; but time sanc- tifies error as well as theft,
and the traditional name is commonly retained for lack of a certain
designation.</p>
<p>tThe Theseum is the best preserved of all ancient Greek buildings;
even so it lacks its marble tiles, its murals, its interior statuary,
its pedimental sculptures, and nearly all of its external coloring. The
metopes are so badly damaged that their reliefs are almost undis -
tinguishable.</p>
<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 33T</p>
<p>On the south bastion Callicrates raised a miniature Ionic temple to
Athena as Nike Apteros, or the Wingless Victory.* Elegant reliefs
(partly pre- served in the Athens Museum) adorned the external
balustrade with figures of winged Victories bringing to Athens their
far-gathered spoils. These Nikai are in the noblest style of Pheidias,
less vigorous than the massive god- desses of the Parthenon, but even
more graceful in motion, and more deli- cate and natural in their
protrayal of drapery. The Victory tying her</p>
<p>sandals deserves her name, for she is one of the triumphs of Greek
art.</p>
<p>At the top of the Acropolis steps Mnesicles built, in elaboration
of</p>
<p>Mycenaean pylons, an entrance with five openings, before each of
which stood a Doric portico; these colonnades in time gave to the whole
edifice their name of Propylaea, or Before the Gates. Each portico
carried a frieze of triglyphs and metopes, and was crowned with a
pediment. Within the passageway was an Ionic colonnade, boldly inserted
within a Doric form. The interior of the northern wing was decorated
with paintings by Polygnotus and others, and contained votive tablets
(pinakes) of terra cotta or marble; hence its name of Pinakotheka, or
Hall of Tablets. A small south wing remained unfinished; war, or the
reaction against Pericles, put a stop to the work, and left an ungainly
mass of beautiful parts as a gateway to the Parthenon.</p>
<p>Within these gates, on the left, was the strangely Oriental
Erechtheum. This, too, was overtaken by war: not more than half of it
was finished when the disaster of Aegospotami reduced Athens to chaos
and poverty. It was begun after Pericles’ death, under the prodding of
conservatives who feared</p>
<p>• Statues of Nike, or Victory, were often made without wings, so that

<p>columns as beautiful as any of their kind.* In the northern porch was
a perfect portal, adorned with a molding of marble flowers. In the cella
was the primitive wooden statue of Athena, which the pious believed had
fallen from heaven; there, too, was the great lamp whose fire was never
extin- guished, and which Callimachus, the Cellini of his time, had
fashioned of gold and embellished with acanthus leaves, like his
Corinthian capitals. The south portico was the famous Porch of the
Maidens, or Caiyatids.t These patient women were descended, presumably,
from the basket bearers of the Orient; and an early caryatid at Tralles,
in Asia Minor, betrays the Eastern — probably the Assyrian — origin of
the form. The drapery is superb, and the natural flexure of the knee
gives an impression of ease; but even these sub- stantial ladies seem
hardly strong enough to convey that sense of sturdy and reliable support
which the finest architecture gives. It was an aberra- tion of taste
that Pheidias would probably have forbidden.</p>
<p>3 . TheFarthenon</p>
<p>In 447 Ictinus, aided by Callicrates, and under the general
supervision of Pheidias and Pericles, began to build a new temple for
Athene Parthenos. In the western end of the structure he placed a room
for her maiden priest- esses, and called it the room “of the virgins”—
tow parthenon; and in the course of careless time this name of a part,
by a kind of architectural met- aphor, was applied to the whole. Ictinus
chose as his material the white marble of Mt. Pentelicus, veined with
iron grains. No mortar was used; the blocks were so accurately squared
and so finely finished that each stone grasped the next as if the two
were one. The column drums were bored to let a small cylinder of
olivewood connect them, and permit each drum to be turned around and
around upon the one below it until the meeting sur- faces were ground so
smooth that the division between drums was almost invisible.“</p>
<ul>
<li>These columns, rather than those of the Parthenon, set the style for
later architecture. The foot of each was modulated into the stylobate by
an “Attic base” of three members, articulated by iUlets or bands. The
top of the column was graduated into the voluted capital by a band of
flowers. The entablature had a richly decorated molding, a frieze of
black stone, and, under the comice, a series of reliefs. The
egg-and-dart and honeysuckle orna- ment of the molding was as carefully
carved as the sculpture; the artists were paid as much for a foot of
such molding as for a figure in the frieze.“</li>
</ul>
<p>t This term was applied to the figures by the Roman architect
Vitruvius, from the name given to the priestesses of Artemis at Caryae
in Laconia. The Athenians called them simply korai, or Maidens.</p>
<p>CHAP.Xrv) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 3J3</p>
<p>The Style was pure Doric, and of classic simplicity. The design was
rec- tangular, for the Greeks did not care for circular or conical
forms; hence there were no arches in Greek architecture, though Greek
architects must have been familiar with them. The dimensions were
modest: 228x101x65 feet. Probably a system of proportion, like the
Polycleitan canon, prevailed in every part of the building, all
measurements bearing a given relation to the diameter of the column.“ At
Poseidonia the height of the column was four times its diameter; here it
was five; and the new form mediated success- fully between Spartan
sturdiness and Attic elegance. Each column swelled slightly (three
quarters of an inch in diameter) from base to middle, tapered toward the
top, and leaned toward the center of its colonnade; each comer column
was a trifle thicker than the rest. Every horizontal line of stylobate
and entablature was curved upward towards its center, so that the eye
placed at one end of any supposedly level line could not see the farther
half of the line. The metopes were not quite square, but were designed
to ap- pear square from below. All these curvatures were subtle
corrections for optical illusions that would otherwise have made
stylobate lines seem to sink in the center, columns to diminish upward
from the base, and comer columns to be thinner and outwardly inclined.
Such adjustments required considerable knowledge of mathematics and
optics, and constituted but one of those mechanical features that made
the temple a perfect union of science and art. In the Parthenon, as in
current physics, every straight line was a curve, and, as in a painting,
every part was drawn toward the center in subtle composition. The result
was a certain flexibility and grace that seemed to give life and freedom
to the stones.</p>
<p>Above the plain architrave ran an alternating series of triglyphs
and</p>
<p>metopes. In the ninety-two metopes were high reliefs recounting once
more the straggle of “civilization” against “savagery” in the wars of
Greeks</p>
<ul>
<li>The naming of the Parthenon figures is mostly conjectural.</li>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>Pheidias considers it an ill wind that does not disturb some robe.
Here also was a majestic “Hebe,” the goddess of youth, who filled the
cups of the Oly mpians with nectar; and here were three imposing
“Fates.” In the left comer four horses’ heads— eyes flashing, nostrils
snorting, mouths foaming with speed — announced the rising of the sun,
while in the right corner the moon drove her chariot to her setting;
these eight are the finest horses in sculptural history. In the west
pediment Athena contested with Poseidon the lordship of Attica. Here
again were horses, as if to redeem the forked absurdity of man; and
reclining figures that represented, with unrealistic magnificence,
Athens’ modest streams. Perhaps the male figures are too muscular, and
the female too spacious; but seldom has statuary been grouped so
naturally, or so skillfully adjusted to the narrowing spaces of a
pediment. “All other statues,” said Canova, with some hyperbole, “are of
stone; these are of flesh and blood.”</p>
<p>More attractive, however, are the men and women of the frieze. For
525 feet along the top of the outer wall of the cella, within the
portico, ran this most famous of all reliefs. Here, presumably, the
youths and maids of Attica are bearing homage and gifts to Athena on the
festival day of the Panathenaic games. One part of the procession moves
along the west and north sides, another along the south side, to meet on
the east front before the goddess, who proudly offers to Zeus and other
Olympians the hospital- ity of her city and a share of her spoils.
Handsome knights move in graceful dignity on still handsomer steeds;
chariots support dignitaries, while simple folk are happy to join in on
foot; pretty girls and quiet old men carry olive branches and trays of
cakes; attendants bear on their shoulders jugs of sacred wine; stately
women convey to the goddess the peplos that they have woven and
embroidered for her in long anticipation of this holy day; sacrificial
vic- tims move with bovine patience or angry prescience to their fate;
maidens of high degree bring utensils of ritual and sacrifice; and
musicians play on their flutes deathless ditties of no tone. Seldom have
animals or men been honored with such painstaking art. With but two and
a quarter inches of relief the sculptors were able, by shading and
modeling, to achieve such an illusion of depth that one horse or
horseman seems to be beyond another, though the nearest is raised no
farther from the background than the rest.“ Perhaps it was a mistake to
place this extraordinary relief so high that men could not comfortably
contemplate it, or exhaust its excellence. Pheidias excused himself,
doubtless with a twinkle in his eye, on the ground that the gods could
see it; but the gods were dying while he carved.</p>

<p>CHAP.XIV) THE ART OF PERICLEAN GREECE 335</p>
<p>temple. The interior was relatively small; much of the space was
taken up by two double-storied Doric colonnades that supported the roof,
and divided the naos into a nave and two aisles; while in the western
end Athene Parthenos blinded her worshipers with the gold of her
raiment, or fright- ened them with her spear and shield and snakes.
Behind her was the Room of the Virgins, adorned with four columns in the
Ionic style. The marble tiles of the roof were sufficiently translucent
to let some light into the nave, and yet opaque enough to keep out the
heat; moreover, piety, like love, deprecates the sun. The cornices were
decorated with careful detail, sur- mounted with terra-cotta acroteria,
and armed with gargoyles to carry off the rain. Many parts of the temple
were painted, not in subdued colors but in bright tints of yellow, blue,
and red. The marble was washed with a stain of saffron and milk; the
triglyphs and parts of the molding were blue; the frieze had a blue
background, the metopes a red, and every figure in them was colored.® A
people accustomed to a Mediterranean sky can bear and relish brighter
hues than those that suit the clouded atmosphere of northern Europe.
Today, shorn of its colors, the Parthenon is most beauti- ful at night,
when through every columned space come changing vistas of sky, or the
ever worshipful moon, or the lights of the sleeping city mingling with
the stars.*</p>
<p>Greek art was the greatest of Greek products; for though its
masterpieces have yielded one by one to the voracity of time, their form
and spirit still survive sufficiently to be a guide and stimulus to many
arts, many genera- tions, and many lands. There were faults here, as in
all that men do. The</p>
<ul>
<li>The Parthenon, like the Erechtheum and the Theseum, was preserved
through its use as a Christian church; it needed no great change of
name, being in each case dedicated to the Virgin. After the Turkish
occupation in 1456 it was transformed into a mosque, and acquired a
minaret. In 1687, when the Venetians besieged Athens, the Turks used the
temple to store each day’s supply of powder for their artillery. The
Venetian commander, so informed, ordered his gunners to fire upon the
Parthenon. A shell pierced the roof, exploded the powder, and laid half
the building in ruins. After capturing the city Morosini tried also to
take the pediment statuary, but his workmen dropped and smashed the
figures in lowering them. In 1800 Lord Elgin, British ambassador to
Turkey, secured permission to remove a part of the sculptures to the
British Museum, on the ground that they would be safer there than at
Athens against weather and war. His spoils included twelve statues,
fifteen metopes, and fifty- six slabs of the frieze. The Museum’s expert
on sculpture advised against buying this material; it was only after ten
years of negotiations that the Museum agreed to pay 75,000 for them,
which was less than half what Lord Elgin had spent in securing and
transporting them.” A few years later, during the Greek War of
Independence (1821 -1830), the Acropolis was twice bombarded, and much
of the Erechtheum was destroyed.” Some metopes of the Parthenon are
still in place; a few slabs of the frieze are in the Athens Museum, and
a few others in the Louvre. The citizens of Nashville, Tennessee, have
built a replica of the Parthenon, in the same dimensions as the
original, with like materials, and, so far as our knowledge goes, with
the same decorations and coloring; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art
contains a small hypothetical reproduction of the interior.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>33&lt;S</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>sculpture was too physical, and rarely reached the soul; it moves us
more often to admire its perfection than to feel its life. The
architecture was narrowly limited in form and style, and clung across a
thousand years to the simple rectangle of the Mycenaean megaron. It
achieved almost nothing in secular fields; it attempted only the easier
problems of construction, and avoided difficult tasks like the arch and
the vault, which might have given it greater scope. It held up its roofs
with the clumsy expedient of internal and superimposed colonnades. It
crowded the interior of its temples with statues whose size was out of
proportion to the edifice, and whose ornamentation lacked the simplicity
and restraint that we expect of the classic style.* But no faults can
outweigh the fact that Greek art created the classic style. The essence
of that style — if the theme of this chapter may be restated in closing
— is order and form: moderation in design, expression, and decora- tion;
proportion in the parts and unity in the whole; the supremacy of rea-
son without the extinction of feeling; a quiet perfection that is
content with simplicity, and a sublimity that owes nothing to size. No
other style but the Gothic has had so much influence; indeed, Greek
statuary is still the ideal, and until yesterday the Greek column
dominated architecture to the discouragement of more congenial forms. It
is good that we are freeing ourselves from the Greeks; even perfection
becomes oppressive when it will not change. But long after our
liberation is complete we shall find in- struction and stimulus in that
art which was the life of reason in form, and in that classic style
which was the most characteristic gift of Greece to mankind.</p>
<p>•One might also note the lack of order in the arrangement of the
buildings on the Acropolis, or in the sacred enclosure at Olympia; but
it is difficult to say whether this dis- order was a defect of taste or
an accident of l^ory.</p>
