<p>Crete</p>
<p>I. THE MEDITERRANEAN</p>
<p>AS we enter the fairest of all waters, leaving behind us the Atlantic
and Xm. Gibraltar, we pass at once into the arena of Greek history.
“Like</p>
<p>frogs around a pond,” said Plato, “we have settled down upon the
shores of this sea.’” Even on these distant coasts the Greeks founded
precarious, barbarian-bound colonies many centuries before Christ: at
Hemeroscopium and Ampurias in Spain, at Marseilles and Nice in France,
and almost every- where in southern Italy and Sicily. Greek colonists
established prosperous towns at Cyrene in northern Africa, and at
Naucratis in the delta of the Nile; their restless enterprise stirred
the islands of the Aegean and the coasts of Asia Minor then as in our
century; all along the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora and the Black
Sea they built towns and cities for their far- venturing trade. Mainland
Greece was but a small part of the ancient Greek world.</p>
<p>Why was it that the second group of historic civilizations took form
on the Mediterranean, as the first had grown up along the rivers of
Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, as the third would flourish on the
Atlantic, and as the fourth may appear on the shores of the Pacific? Was
it the better climate of the lands washed by the Mediterranean? There,
then as now,* winter rains nourished the earth, and moderate frosts
stimulated men; there, almost all the year round, one might live an
open-air life under a warm but not enervating sun. And yet the surface
of the Mediterranean coasts and islands is nowhere so rich as the
alluvial valleys of the Ganges, the Indus, the Tigris, the Euphrates, or
the Nile; the summer’s drought may begin too soon or last too long; and
everywhere a rocky basis hirks under the thin crust of the dusty earth.
The temperate north and the tropic south are both more fertile than
these historic lands where patient peasants, weary of coaxing the soil,
more and more abandoned tillage to grow olives and the vine. Aud at any
moment, along one or another of a hundred faults, earthquakes might
split the ground benea th men’s feet, and frighten them into a fitful
piety. Climate did not draw civilization to Greece; probably it has
never made a civiliza- tion anywhere.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>What drew men into the Aegean was its islands. The islands were
beauti- ful; even a worried mariner must have been moved by the changing
colors of those shadowed hills that rose like temples out of the
reflecting sea. To- day there are few sights lovelier on the globe; and
sailing the Aegean, one begins to understand why the men who peopled
those coasts and isles came to love them almost more than life, and,
like Socrates, thought exUe bitterer than death. But further, the
mariner was pleased to find that these island jewels were strewn in all
directions, and at such short intervals that his ship, whether going
between east and west or between north and south, would never be more
than forty miles from land. And since the islands, like the mainland
ranges, were the mountaintops of a once continuous territory that had
been gradually submerged by a pertinacious sea,‘ some welcome peak
always greeted the outlook’s eye, and served as a beacon to ships that
had as yet no compass to guide them. Again, the movements of wind and
water conspired to help the sailor reach his goal. A strong central
current flowed from the Black Sea into the Aegean, and countercurrents
flowed northward along the coasts; while the northeasterly etesian winds
blew regularly in the summer to help back to their southern ports the
ships that had gone to fetch grain, fishj and furs from the Euxine Sea.*
Fog was rare in the Mediter- ranean, and the unfailing sunshine so
varied the coastal winds that at almost any harbor, from spring to
autumn, one might be carried out by a morning, and brought back by an
evening, breeze.</p>
<p>In these propitious waters the acquisitive Phoenicians and the
amphibious Greeks developed the art and science of navigation. Here they
built ships for the most part larger or faster, and yet more easily
handled, than any that had yet sailed the Mediterranean. Slowly, despite
pirates and harassing uncertainties, the water routes from Europe and
Africa into Asia — through Cyprus, Sidon, and Tyre, or through the
Aegean and the Black Sea — became cheaper than the long land routes,
arduous and perilous, that had carried so much of the commerce of Egypt
and the Near E^. Trade took new lines, multiplied new populations, and
created new wealth. Egypt, then Meso- potamia, then Persia withered;
Phoenicia deposited an empire of cities along the African coast, in
Sicily, and in Spain; and Greece blossomed like a watered rose.</p>
<p>• The Greeks called the Mediterranean Ho Pontos, the Passage or Road,
and euphemisti - cally termed the Black Sea Ho Pontos Euxeinos — the Sea
Kindly to Guests — perhaps because it welcomed ships from the south with
adverse currents and winds. The broad rivers that fed it, and the
frequent mists that reduced its rate of evaporation, kept the Black Sea
at a higher level than the Mediterranean, and caused a powerful current
to rush through the narrow Bosporus (Ox-ford) and the Hellespont into
the Aegean. The Sea of Marmora was the Propontis, Before the Sea.</p>

<li>THE REDISCOVERY OF CRETE</li>
</ol>
<p>“There is a land called Cr ete, in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a
fair, rick land, begirt with water; and therein are many men past
counting, and ninety cities.”* When Homer sang these lines, perhaps in
the ninth century before our era,* Greece had almost forgotten, though
the poet had not, that the island whose wealth seemed to him even then
so great had once been wealthier sdll; that it had held sway with a
powerful fleet over most of the Aegean and part of mainland Greece; and
that it had developed, a thousand years before the siege of Troy, one of
the most artistic civilizations in his- tory. Probably it was this
Aegean culture — as ancient to him as he is to us — that Homer recalled
when he spoke of a Golden Age in which men had been more civilized, and
life more refined, than in his own disordered time.</p>
<p>The rediscovery of that lost civilization is one of the major
achievements of modem archeology. Here was an island twenty times larger
than the largest of the Cyclades, pleasant in climate, varied in the
products of its fields and once richly wooded hills, and strategically
placed, for trade or war, midway between Phoenicia and Italy, between
Egypt and Greece. Aristotle had pointed out how excellent this situation
was, and how “it had enabled Minos to acquire the empire of the
Aegean.”’ But the story of Minos, accepted as fact by all classical
writers, was rejected as legend by modem scholars; and until sixty years
ago it was the custom to suppose, with Grote, that the history of
civ^zation in the Aegean had begun with the Dorian invasion, or the
Olympic games. Then in a.d. 1878 a Cretan mer- chant, appropriately
named Minos Kalokairinos, unearthed some strange antiquities on a
hillside south of Candia.f The great Schliemann, who had but lately
resurrected Mycenae and Troy, visited the site in 1886, an- nounced his
conviction that it covered the remains of the ancient Cnossus, and
opened negotiations with the owner of the land so that excavations might
begin at once. But the owner haggled and tried to cheat; and Schlie-
mann, who had been a merchant before becoming an archeologist, with-
drew in anger, losing a golden chance to add another civilization to
history. A few years later he died.’</p>
<p>In 1893 a British archeologist. Dr. Arthur Evans, bought in Athens
a</p>
<p>number of milkstones from Greek women who had worn them as amulets.
He was curious about the hieroglyphics engraved upon them, which no
scholar could read. Tracing the stones to Crete, he secured passage
thither.</p>

<p>and wandered about the island picking up examples of what he believed
to be ancient Cretan writing. In 1895 he purchased a part, and in 1900
the re- mainder, of the site that Schliemann and the French School at
Athens had identified with Cnossus; and in nine weeks of that spring,
digging feverishly with one hundred and fifty men, he exhumed the
richest treasure of modem historical research — the palace of Minos.
Nothing yet known from an- tiquity could equal the vastness of this
complicated stracture, to all appear- ances identical with the almost
endless Labyrinth so famous in old Greek tales of Minos, Daedalus,
Theseus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur. In these and other ruins, as if to
confirm Evans’ intuition, thousands of seals and clay tablets were
found, bearing characters like those that had set him upon the trail.
The fires that had destroyed the palaces of Cnossus had preserved these
tablets, whose undeciphered pictographs and scripts still conceal the
early story of the Aegean.*</p>
<p>Students from many countries now hurried to Crete. While Evans was
working at Cnossus, a group of resolute Italians — Halbherr, Pemier,
Savig- noni, Paribeni — imearthed at Hagia Triada (Holy Trinity) a
sarcophagus painted with illuminating scenes from Cretan life, and
uncovered at Phaestus a palace only less extensive than that of the
Cnossus kings. Meanwhile two Americans, Seager and Mrs. Hawes, made
discoveries at Vasiliki, Mochlos, and Goumia; the British — Hogarth,
Bosanquet, Dawkins, Myres — explored Palaikastro, Psychro, and Zakro;
the Cretans themselves became interested, and Xanthoudidis and
Hatzidakis dug up ancient residences, grottoes, and tombs at
Arkalochori, Tylissus, Koumasa, and Chamaizi. Half the nations of Europe
united under the flag of science in the very generation in which their
statesmen were preparing for war.</p>
<p>How was all this material to be classified — these palaces,
paintings, statues, seals, vases, metals, tablets, and reliefs? — to
what period of the past were they to be assigned? Precariously, but with
increasing corroboration as research went on and knowledge grew, Evans
dated the relics according to the depth of their strata, the gradation
of styles in the pottery, and the agreement of Cretan finds, in form or
motive, with like objects exhumed in lands or deposits whose chronology
was approximately known. Digging down patiently beneath Cnossus, he
found himself stopped, some forty-three feet below the surface, by the
virgin rock. The lower half of the excavated area was occupied by
remains characteristic of the Neolithic Age — primitive forms of
handmade pottery with simple linear ornament, spindle whorls for
spinning and weaving, fat-buttocked * Evans labored brilliantly at
Cnossus for many years, was knighted for his discoveries, and completed,
in 1936, his monumental four-volume report. The Piuace of Minos.</p>

<p>goddesses of painted steatite or clay, tools and weapons of polished
stone, but nothing in copper or bronze.* Classifying the pottery, and
correlating the remains with those of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt,
Evans divided the post- neolithic and prehistoric culture of Crete into
three ages — Early, Middle, and Late Minoan — and each of these into
three periods.t</p>
<p>The first or lowest appearance of copper in the strata represents for
us, through a kind of archeological shorthand, the slow rise of a new
civilization out of the neolithic stage. By the end of the Early Minoan
Age the Cretans learn to mix copper with tin, and the Bronze Age begins.
In Middle Minoan I the earliest palaces occur: the princes of Cnossus,
Phaestus, and Mallia build for themselves luxurious dwellings with
countless rooms, spacious storehouses, specialized workshops, altars and
temples, and great drainage conduits that startle the arrogant
Occidental eye. Pottery takes on a many- colored brilhance, walls are
enlivened with charming frescoes, and a form of linear script evolves
out of the hieroglyphics of the preceding age. Then, at the close of
Middle Minoan II, some strange catastrophe writes its cynical record
into the strata; the palace of Cnossus is laid low as if by a convulsion
of the earth, or perhaps by an attack from Phaestus, whose palace for a
time is spared. But a little later a like destruction falls upon
Phaespis, Mochlos, Goumia, Palaikastro, and many other cities in the
island; the pottery is covered with ashes, the great jars in the
storerooms are filled with debris. Middle Minoan III is a period of
comparative stagnation, in which, per- haps, the southeastern
Mediterranean world is long disordered by the Hyksos conquest of
Egypt.’</p>
<p>In the late Minoan Age everything begins again. Humanity, patient</p>
<p>under every cataclysm, renews its hope, takes courage, and builds
once more. New and finer palaces rise at Cnossus, Phaestus, Tylissus,
Hagia Triada, and Goumia. The lordly spread, the five-storied height,
the luxuri- ous decoration of these princely residences suggest such
wealth as Greece would not know till Pericles. Theaters are erected in
the palace courts, and gladiatorial spectacles of men and women in
deadly combat with animak amuse gentlemen and ladies whose aristocratic
faces, quietly alert, still live</p>

<p>for US on the bright frescoes of the resurrected walls. Wants are
multiplied, tastes are refined, literature flourishes; a thousand
industries graciously per- mit the poor to prosper by supplying comforts
and delicacies to the rich. The halls of the king are noisy with scribes
taking inventories of goods dis- tributed-or received; with artists
making statuary, paintings, pottery, or re- liefs; with high ofiicials
conducting conferences, hearing judicial appeals, or dispatching papers
stamped with their finely wrought seals; while wasp- waisted princes and
jeweled duchesses, alluringly decollete, crowd to a royal feast served
on tables shining with bronze and gold. The sixteenth and fifteenth
centuries before our era are the zenith of Aegean civilization, the
classic and golden age of Crete.</p>
<p>HI. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>If now we try to restore this buried culture from the relics that
remain- playing Cuvier to the scattered bones of Crete — let us remember
that we are engaging upon a hazardous kind of historical television, in
which imagina- tion must supply the living continuity in the gaps of
static and fragmentary material artificially moving but long since dead.
Crete will remain inwardly unknown until its secretive tablets find
their Champollion.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Men and Women</li>
</ol>
<p>As we see them self-pictured in their art, the Cretans curiously
resemble the double ax so prominent in their religious symbolism. Male
and female alike have torsos narrowing pathologically to an ultramodern
waist. Nearly all are short in stature, slight and supple of build,
graceful in movement, athletically trim. Their slan is white at birth.
The ladies, who court the shade, have fair complexions conventionally
pale; but the men, pursuing wealth under the sun, are so tanned and
ruddy that the Greeks will call them (as well as the Phoenicians)
Fhoinikes — xht Purple Ones, Redskins. The head is rather long than
broad, the features are sharp and refined, the hair and eyes are
brilliantly dark, as in the Italians of today; these Cretans are
apparently a branch of the “Mediterranean race.”* The men as well as the
women wear their hair partly in coils on the head or the neck, partly in
ring-</p>
<p>• Current anthropology divides post -neolithic Europeans into three
types, respectively pre- ponderating in north, central, and southern
Euro pe: (i) “Nordic” man— long-headed, tall, and fair of skin and eyes
and hair; (2) “Alpine” man— broad-headed, of medium height, with eyes
tending to gray and hair to brown; and (3) “Mediterranean” man—
long-headed, short, and dark. No people is exclusive ly any of these
“races.”</p>

<p>lets on the brow, partly in tresses falling upon the shoulders or the
breast. The women add ribbons for their curls, while the men, to keep
their faces clean, provide themselves with a variety of raz ors, even in
the grave.”</p>
<p>The dress is as strange as the figures. On their heads — most often
bare — the men have turbans or tam- o’ -shanters, the women magnificent
hats of our early twentieth-century style. The feet are usually free of
covering; but the upper classes may bind them in white leather shoes,
which among women may be daintily embroidered at the edges, with colored
beads on the straps. Ordinarily the male has no clothing above the
waist; there he wears a short skirt or waistcloth, occasionally with a
codpiece for modesty. The skirt may be slit at the side in workingmen;
in dignitaries and ceremo- nies it reaches in both sexes to the ground.
Occasionally the men wear drawers, and in winter a long outer garment of
wool or skins. The clothing is tightly laced about the middle, for men
as well as women are resolved to be — or seem — triangularly slim.” To
rival the men at this point, the women of the later periods resort to
stiff corsets, which gather their skirts snugly around their hips, and
lift their bare breasts to the sun. It is a pretty custom among the
Qretans that the female bosom should be uncovered, or revealed by a
diaphanous chemise;” no one seems to take offense. The bodice is laced
below the bust, opens in a careless circle, and then, in a gesture of
charming reserve, may close in a Medici collar at the neck. The sleeves
are short, sometimes puffed. The skirt, adorned with flounces and gay
tints, widens out spaciously from the hips, stiffened presumably with
metal ribs or horizontal hoops. There are in the arrangement and design
of Cretan feminine dress a warm harmony of colors, a grace of line, a
delicacy of taste, that suggest a rich and luxurious civilization,
already old in arts and wiles. In these matters the Cretans had no
influence upon the Greeks; only in modem capitals have their styles
triumphed. Even staid archeologists have given the name La Parisienne to
the portrait of a Cretan lady with pro- fulgent bosom, shapely neck,
sensual mouth, impudent nose, and a persua- sive, provocative charm;
she-sits saucily before us today as part of a frieze in which high
personages gaze upon some spectacle that we shall never see.” The men of
Crete are evidently grateful for the grace and adventure that women give
to life, for they provide them with costly means of en- hancing their
loveliness. The remains are rich in jewelry of many kinds: hairpins of
copper and gold, stickpins adorned -with golden animals or flow- ers, or
heads of crystal or quartz; rings or spirals of filigree gold mingling
with the hair, fillets or diadems of precious metal binding it; rings
and pendants hanging from the ear, plaques and beads and chains on the
breast.</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. 1</p>
<p>bands and bracelets on the arm, finger rings of silver, steatite,
agate, car- nelian, amethyst, or gold. The men keep some of the jewelry
for them- selves: .if they are poor they carry necklaces and bracelets
of common stones; if they can afford it they flaunt great rings engraved
with scenes of battle or the chase. The famous Cupbearer wears on the
biceps of his left arm a broad band of precious metal, and on the wrist
a bangle inlai d with agate. Everywhere in Cretan life man expresses his
vainest and noblest passion — the zeal to beautify.</p>
<p>This use of man to signify all humanity reveals the prejudice of a
patri- archal age, and hardly suits the almost matriarchal life of
ancient Crete. For the Minoan woman does not put up with any Oriental
seclusion, any purdah or harem; there is no sign of her being limited to
certain quarters of the house, or to the home. She works there,
doubtless, as some women do even today; she weaves clothing and baskets,
grinds grain, and bakes bread. But also she labors with men in the
fields and the potteries, she mingles freely with them in the crowds,
she takes the front seat at the theater and the games, she sweeps
through Cretan society with the air of a great lady bored with
adoration; and when her nation creates its gods it is more often in her
likeness than in man’s. Sober students, secretly and forgivably enamored
of the mother image in their hearts, bow down before her relics, and
marvel at her domination.”</p>
<p>2, Society</p>
<p>Hypothetically we picture Crete as at first an island divided by its
moun- tains among petty jealous clans which live in independent villages
under their own chiefs, and fight, after the manner of men, innumerable
territorial wars. Then a resolute leader appears who unites several
clans into a kingdom, and builds his fortress palace at Cnossus,
Phaestus, Tylissus, or some other town. The wars become less frequent,
more widespread, and more efficient in killing; at last the cities fight
for rhe entire island, and Cnossus wins. The victor organizes a navy,
dominates the Aegean, sup- presses piracy, exacts tribute, builds
palaces, and patronizes the arts, like an early Pericles.” It is as
difficult to begin a civilization ■ without robbery as it is to maintain
it without slaves.*</p>

<li>The usually cautious and accurate Thucydides writes: **The first
person known to us by tradition as having established a navy is Minos.
He made himself master of what is now called the Hellenic Sea, and ruled
over the Cyclades. . . . He did his best to put down piracy in those
waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues for his own use.”*“</li>

use: his priests explain to the people that he is descended from
Velchanos, and has received from this deity the laws that he decrees;
and every nine years, if he is competent or generous, they reanoint him
with the divine authority. To symbolize his power the monarch,
anticipating Rome and France, adopts the’ (double) ax and the
fleur-de-lis. To administer the state he em- ploys (as the litter of
tablets suggests) a staff of ministers, bureaucrats, and scribes. He
taxes in kind, and stores in giant jars his revenues of grain, oil, and
wine; and out of this treasury, in kind, he pays his men. From his
throne in the palace, or his judgment seat in the royal villa, he
settles in person such litigation as has run the gauntlet of his
appointed courts; and so great is his reputation as a magistrate that
when he dies he becomes in Hades, Homer assures us, the inescapable
judge of the dead.” We call him Minos, but we do not know his name;
probably the word is a title, like Pharaoh or Caesar, and covers a
multitude of kings.</p>
<p>At its height this civilization is surprisingly urban. The Iliad
speaks of Crete’s “ninety cities,” and the Greeks who conquer them are
astonished at their teeming populations; even today the student stands
in awe before the ruined mazes of paved and guttered streets,
intersecting lanes, and count- less shops or houses crowding about some
center of trade or government in all the huddled gregariousness of timid
and talkative men. It is not only Cnossus that is great, with palaces so
vast that imagination perhaps exag- gerates the town that must have been
the chief source and beneficiary of their wealth. Across the island, on
the southern shore, is Phaestus, from whose harbor, Homer tells us, “the
dark -prowed ships are borne to Egypt by the force of the wind and the
wave.”” The southbound trade of Minoan Ciete pours out here, swelled by
goods from northern merchants who ship their cargoes overland to avoid a
long detour by perilous seas. Phaestus becomes a Cretan Piraeus, in love
with commerce rather than with art. And yet the palace of its prince is
a majestic edifice, reached by a flight of steps forty-five feet wide;
its halls and courts compare with those at Cnossus; its central court is
a paved quadrangle of ten thousand square feet; its megaron, or
reception room, is three thousand square feet in area, larger even than
the great Hall of the Double Ax in the northern capital.</p>
<p>Two miles north west is Hagia Triada, in whose “royal villa” (as
archeo - logical imagination calls it) the Prince of Phaestus seeks
refuge from the summer heat. The eastern end of the island, in Minoan
days, is rich in small towns: ports like Zakro or Mochlos, villages like
Praesus or Pseira, resi- dential quarters like Palaikastro,
manufacturing centers like Goumia. The</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>main street in Palaikastro is well paved, well drained, and lined
with spa- cious homes; one of these has twenty-three rooms on the
surviving floor. Goumia boasts of avenues paved with gypsum, of homes
built with mortar- less stone, of a blacksmith’s shop with extant forge,
of a carpenter shop with a kit of tools, of small factories noisy with
metalworking, shoemaking, vase- making, oil refining, or textile
industry; the modern workmen who excavate it, and gather up its tripods,
jars, pottery, ovens, lamps, knives, mortars, polishers, hooks, pins,
daggers, and swords, marvel at its varied products and equipment, and
call it he mechanike po/w — “the town of machinery.’”* By our standards
the minor streets are narrow, mere alleys in the style of a semitropical
Orient that fears the sun; and the rectangular houses, of wood or brick
or stone, are for the most part confined to a single floor. Yet some
Middle Minoan plaques exhumed at Cnossus show us homes of two, three,
even five stories, with a cubicle attic or turret here and there; on the
upper floors, in these pictured houses, are windows with red panes of
unknown material. Double doors, swinging on posts apparently of cypress
wood, open from the ground-floor rooms upon a shaded court. Stairways
lead to the upper floors and the roof, where the Cretan sleeps when the
nights are very warm. If he spends the evening indoors he lights his
room by burning oil, according to h^ income, in lamps of clay, steatite,
gypsum, marble, or bronze.**</p>
<p>We know a trifle or two about the games he plays. At home he likes a
form of chess, for he has bequeathed to us, in the ruins of the Cnossus
palace, a magnificent gaming board with frame of ivory, squares of
silver and gold, and a border of seventy-two daisies in precious metal
and stone. In the fields he takes with zest and audacity to the chase,
guided by half-wild cats and slender thoroughbred hounds. In the towns
he patronizes pugilists, and on his vases and reliefs he represents for
us a variety of contests, in which light- weights spar with bare hands
and kicking feet, middleweights with plumed helmets batter each other
manfully, and heavyweights, coddled with helmets, cheekpieces, and long
padded gloves, fight till one falls exhausted to the ground and the
other stands above him in the conscious grandeur of victory.*</p>
<p>But the Cretan’s greatest thrill comes when he wins his way into the
crowd that fills the amphitheater on a holiday to see men and women face
death against huge charging bulls. Time and again he pictures the stages
of this lusty sport: the daring hunter capturing the bull by jumping
astride its neck as it laps up water from a pool; the professional tamer
twisting the animal’s head until it learns some measure of tolerance for
the acrobat’s annoying tricks; the skilled performer, slim and agile,
meeting the bull in</p>
<p>CRETE</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>the arena, grasping its horns, leaping into the air, somersaulting
over its back, and landing feet fct on the ground in the arms of a
female companion who lends her grace to the scene.” Even in Minoan Crete
this is already an an - cient art; a clay cylinder from Cappadocia,
ascribed to 2400 b.c., shows a bull- grappling sport as vigorous and
dangerous as in these frescoes.” For a moment our oversimplifyiiig
intellects catch a glimpse of the contradictory complexity of man as we
perceive that this game of blood-lust and courage, still popular today,
is as oM as civilization.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>The Cretan may be brutal, but he is certainly religious, with a
thoroughly human mixture of fetishism and superstition, idealism and
reverence. He wor- ships mountains, caves, stones, the number 3, trees
and pillars, sun and moon, goats and snakes, doves and bulls; hardly
anything escapes his theology. He conceives the air as filled with
spirits genial or devilish, and hands down to Greece a sylvan-ethereal
population of dryads, sileni, and nymphs. He does not directly adore the
ph^ic emblem, but he venerates with awe the genera- tive vitality of the
bull and the snake.*® Since his death rate is high he pays devout homage
to fertility, and when he rises to the notion of a human divinity he
pic- tures a mother goddess with generous mammae and sublime flanks,
with rep- tiles creeping up around her arms and breasts, coiled in her
hair, or rearing themselves proudly from her head. He sees in her the
basic fact of nature — that man’s greatest enemy, death, is overcome by
woman’s mysterious power, reproduction; and he identifies this power
with deity. The mother goddess represents for him the source of all
life, in plants and animals as well as in men; if he surrounds her image
with fauna and flora it is because these exist through her creative
fertility, and therefore serve as her symbols and her emanations.
Occasionally she appears holding in her arms her divine child Velchanos,
whom she has borne in a mountain cave.® Contemplating this ancient
image, we see through it Isis and Homs, Ishtar and Tammuz, Cybele and
Attis, Aphrodite and Adonis, and feel the unity of prehistoric culture,
and the continuity of religious ideas and symbols, in the Mediterranean
world.</p>
<p>The Cretan Zeus, as the Greeks call Velchanos, is subordinate to his
mother in the affections of the Cretans. But he grows in importance. He
becomes the personification of the fertilizing rain, of the moisture
that in this religion, as in the philosophy of Thales, underlies all
things. He dies, and his sepulcher is shown from generation to
generation on Mt. louktas, where the majestic profile of his face can
still be seen by the imaginative traveler; he rises from the grave as a
symbol of reviving vegetation, and the Kouretes priests celebrate with
dances and clashing shields his glorious resurrection.® Sometimes, as a
god of fertility, he is conceived as incarnate in the sacred bull; it is
as a bull that he</p>
<p>14 THELIFEOF GREECE ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>mates in Cretan myth with Minos’ wife Pasiphae, and begets by her the
mon - strous Minos-bull, or Minotaur.</p>
<p>To appease these deities the Cretan uses a lavish rite of prayer and
sacrifice, symbol and ceremony, administered usually by women priests,
sometimes by ofiicials of the state. To ward off demons he bums incense;
to arouse a negli- gent divinity he sounds the conch, plays the flute or
the lyre, and sings, in chorus, hymns of adoration. To promote the
growth of orchards and the fields, he waters trees and plants in solemn
ritual; or his priestesses in nude frenzy shake down the ripe burden of
the trees; or his women in festal procession carry fruits and fiowers as
hints and tribute to the goddess, who is borne in state in a palanquin.
He has apparently no temple, but raises altars in the palace court, in
sacred groves or grottoes, and on mountaintops. He adorns these sanctu-
aries with tables of libation and sacrifice, a medley of idols, and
“horns of con - secration” perhaps representativ e of the sacred bull.
He is profuse with holy symbols, which he seems to worship along with
the gods whom they signify: first the shield, presumably as the emblem
of his goddess in her warrior form; then the cross — in both its Greek
and its Roman shapes, and as the swastika — cut upon the forehead of a
bull or the thigh of a goddess, or carved upon seals, or raised in
marble in the palace of the king; above all, the double ax, as an
instra- ment of sacrifice magically enriched with the virtue of the
blood that it sheds, or as a holy weapon unerringly guided by the god,
or even as a sign of Zeus the Thunderer cleaving the sky with his
bolts.®</p>
<p>Finally he offers a modest care and worship to his dead. He buries
them in clay coffins or massive jars, for if they are unburied they may
return. To keep them content below the ground he deposits with them
modest portions of food, articles for their toilette, and clay figurines
of women to tend or console them through all eternity. Sometimes, with
the sly economy of an incipient skeptic, he substitutes clay animals in
the grave in place of actual food. If he buries a king or a noble or a
rich trader he surrenders to the corpse a part of the precious plate or
jewelry that it once possessed; with touching sympathy he buries a set
of chess with a good player, a clay orchestra with a musician, a boat
with one who loved the sea. Periodically he returns to the grave to
offer a sustaining sacrifice of food to the dead. He hopes that in some
secret Elysium, or Islands of the Blest, the just god Rhadamanthus, son
of Zeus Velchanos, will receive the purified soul, and give it the
happiness and the peace that slip so elusively through the fingers in
this earthly quest.</p>

<p>The most troublesome aspect of the Cretan is his language. When,
after the Dorian invasion, he uses the Greek alphabet, it is for a
speech completely alien</p>

<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>*5</p>
<p>to what we know as Greek, and more akin in sound to the Egyptian,
Cypriote, Hittite, and Anatolian dialects of the Near East. In the
earliest age he confines himself to hieroglyphics; about 1800 b.c. he
begins to shorten these into a linear script of some ninety syllabic
signs; two centuries later he contrives another script, whose characters
often resemble those of the Phoenician alphabet; per- haps it is from
him, as well as from the Egyptians and the Semites, that the Phoenicians
gather together those letters they will scatter throughout the Med-
iterranean to become the unassuming, omnipresent instrument of Western
civ- ilization. Even the common Cretan composes, and like some privy
councilor, leaves on the walls of Hagia Triada the passing inspirations
of his muse. At Phaestus we find a kind of prehistoric printing: the
hieroglyphs of a great disk unearthed there from Middle Minoan III
strata are impressed upon the clay by stamps, one for each pictograph;
but here, to add to our befuddlement, the characters are apparently not
Cretan but foreign; perhaps the disk is an impor- tation fro m the
East.”</p>
<p>The clay tablets upon which the Cretan writes may some day reveal to
us his accomplishments in science. He has some astronomy, for he is
famed as a navigator, and tradition hands down to Dorian Crete the
ancient Minoan cal- endar. The Egyptians acknowledge their indebtedness
to him for certain medi- cal prescriptions, and the Greeks borrow from
him, as the words suggest, such aromatic and medicinal herbs as mint
{mintha)^ wormwood {apsinthon)^ and an ideal drug (daukos) reputed to
cure obesity without disturbing gluttony.” But we must not mistake our
guessing for history.</p>
<p>Though the Cretan’s literature is a sealed book to us, we may at
least contem - plate the ruins of his theaters. At Phaestus, about 2000,
he builds ten tiers of stone seats, running some eighty feet along a
wall overlooking a flagged court; at Cnossus he raises, again in stone,
eighteen tiers thirty-three feet long, and, at right angles to them, six
tiers from eighteen to fifty feet in length. These court theaters,
seating four or five hundred persons, are the most ancient play- houses
known to us — older by fifteen hundred years than the Theater of Diony-
sus. We do not know what took place on those stages; frescoes picture
audiences viewing a spectacle, but we cannot tell what it is that they
see. Very likely it is some combination of music and dance. A painting
from Cnossus preserves a group of aristocratic ladies, surrounded by
dieir gallants, watching a dance by gaily petticoated girls in an olive
grove; another represents a Dancing Woman with flying tresses and
extended arms; others show us rustic folk dances, or the wild dance of
priests, priestesses, and worshipers before an idol or a sacred tree.
Homer describes the “dancing -floor which once, in broad Cnossus,
Daedalus made for Ariadne of the lovely hair; there youths and seductive
maidens join hands in the dance . . . and a divine bard sets the time to
the sound of the lyre.”” The seven-stringed lyre, ascribed by the Greeks
to the inventiveness of Ter-</p>
<p>l6 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>pander, is represented on a sarcophagus at Hagia Triada a thousand
years before Terpander’s birth. There, too, is the double flute, with
two pipes, eight holes, and fourteen notes, precisely as in classical
Greece. Carved on a gem, a woman blows a trumpet made from an enormous
conch, and on a vase we see the sistrum beating time for the dancers’
feet.</p>
<p>The same youthful freshness and lighthearted grace that animate his
dances and his games enliven the Cretan ’s work in the arts. He has not
left us, aside from his architecture, any accomplishments of massive
grandeur or exalted style; like the Japanese of samurai days he delights
rather in the refinement of the lesser and more intimate arts, the
adornment of objects daily used, the patient perfecting of little
things. As in every aristocratic civilization, he accepts conventions in
the form and subject of his work, avoids extravagant novelties, and
learns to be free even within the limitations of reserve and taste. He
excels in pottery, gem cutting, bezel carving, and reliefs, for here his
micro- scopic skill finds every stimulus and opportunity. He is at home
in the working of silver and gold, sets all the precious stones, and
makes a rich diversity of jewels. Upon the seals that he cuts to serve
as ofiicial signatures, commercial labels, or business forms, he
engraves in delicate detail so much of the life and scenery of Crete
that from them alone we might picture his civilization. He hammers
bronze into basins, ewers, daggers, and swords ornamented with floral
and animal designs, and inlaid with gold and silver, ivory and rare
stones. At Goumia he has left us, despite the thieves of thirty
centuries, a silver cup of finished artistry; and here and there he has
molded for us rhytons, or drinking horns, rising out of human or animal
heads that to this day seem to hold the breath of life.</p>
<p>As a potter he tries every form, and reaches distinction in nearly
all of them. He makes vases, dishes, cups, chalices, lamps, jars,
animals, and gods. At first, in Early Alinoan, he is content to shape
the vessel with his hands along lines bequeathed to him from the
Neolithic Age, to paint it with a glaze of brown or black, and to trust
the fire to mottle the color into haphazard tints. In Middle Minoan he
has learned the use of the wheel, and rises to the height of his skill.
He makes a glaze rivaling the consistency and delicacy of porcelain; he
scatters recklessly black and brown, white and red, orange and yellow,
crim- son and vermilion, and mingles them happily into novel shades; he
fines down the clay with such confident thoroughness that in his most
perfect product — the graceful and brightly colored “eggshell” wares
found in the cave of Kamares o n Mt. Ida’s slopes— he has dared to thin
the walls of the vessel to a millimeter’s thickness, and to pour out
upon it all the motifs of his rich imagination. From 2100 to 1950 IS the
apogee of the Cretan potter; he signs his name to his work, and his
trade-mark is sought throughout the Mediterranean. In the Late Minoan
Age he brings to full development the technique of faience, and forms
the</p>
<p>CRETE</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>*7</p>
<p>brilliant paste into decorative plaques, vases of turquoise blue,
polychrome god- desses, and marine reliefs so realistic that Evans
mistook an enamel crab for a fossil.®® Now the artist falls in love with
nature, and delights to represent on his vessels the liveliest animals,
the gaudiest fish, the most delicate flowers, and the most graceful
plants. It is in Late Minoan I that he creates his surviving
masterpieces, the Boxers’ Vase and the Harvesters’ Vase: in the one he
presents us crudely with every aspect and attitude of the pugilistic
game, adding a zone of scenes from the bull- leaper’s life; in the other
he follows with fond fidelity a procession probably of peasants marching
and singing in some harvest fes- tival. Then the great tradition of
Cretan pottery grows weak with age, and the art declines; reserve and
taste are forgotten, decoration overruns the vase in bizarre
irregularity and excess, the courage for slow conception and patient
execution breaks down, and a lazy carelessness called freedom replaces
the finesse and finish of the Kamares age. It is a forgivable decay, the
unavoidable death of an old and exhausted art, which will lie in
refreshing sleep for a thou- sand years, and be reborn in the perfection
of the Attic vase.</p>
<p>Sculpture is a minor art in Crete, and except in bas-relief and the
story of Daedalus, seldom graduates from the statuette. Many of these
little figures are stereotyped crudities seemingly produced by rote; one
is a delightful snapshot in ivory of an athlete plunging through the
air; another is a handsome head that has lost its body on the way down
the centuries. The best of them excels in anatomical precision and in
vividness of action anything that we know from Greece before Myron’s
time. The strangest is the Snake Goddess of the Boston Museum — a sturdy
figure of ivory and gold, half mammae and half snakes; here at last the
Cretan artist treats the human form with some amplitude and success. But
when he essays a larger scale he falls back for the most part upon
animals, and confines himself to painted reliefs, as in the bull’s h ead
in the Heracleum Museum; in this startling relic the fixed wild eyes,
the snorting nostrils, the gasping mouth, and the trembling tongue
achieve a power that Greece itself will never surpass.</p>
<p>Nothing else in ancient Crete is quite so attractive as its painting.
The sculp- ture is negligible, the pottery is fragmentary, the
architecture is in ruins; but this frailest of all the arts, easy victim
of indifferent time, has left us legible and admirable masterpieces from
an age so old that it slipped quite out of the mem- ory of that classic
Greece of whose painting, by contrast so recent, not one original
remains. In Crete the earthquakes or the wars that overturned the
palaces preserved here and there a frescoed wall; and wandering by them
we molt forty centuries and meet the men who decorated the rooms of the
Minoan kings. As far back as 2500 they make wall coatings of pure lime,
and conceive the idea of painting in fresco upon the wet surface,
wielding the brush so rapidly that the colors sink into the stucco
before the surface dries. Into the</p>
<p>l8 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. I</p>
<p>dark haUs of the palaces they bring the bright beauty of the open
fields; they make plaster sprout lilies, tulips, narcissi, and sweet
marjoram; no one viewing these scenes could ever again suppose that
nature was discovered by Rousseau. In the museum at Heracleum the
Saffron Picker is as eager to pluck the crocus as when his creator
painted him in Middle Minoan days; his waist is absurdly thin, his body
seems much too long for his legs; and yet his head is perfect, the
colors are soft and warm, the flowers still fresh after four thousand
years. At Hagia Triada the painter brightens a sarcophagus with spiral
scrolls and queer, almost Nubian figures engrossed in some religious
ritual; better yet, he adorns a wall with waving foliage, and then
places in the midst of it, darkly but vividly, a stout, tense cat
preparing to spring unseen upon a proud bird preening its plumage in the
sun. In Late Minoan the Cretan painter is at the top of his stride;
every wall tempts him, eveiy plutocrat calls him; he decorates not
merely the royal residences but the homes of nobles and burghers with
all the lavish- ness of Pompeii. Soon, however, success and a surfeit of
commissions spoil him; he is too anxious to be finished to quite touch
perfection; he scatters quantity about him, repeats his flowers
monotonously, paints his men impossibly, con- tents himself with
sketching outlines, and falls into the lassitude of an art that knows
that it has passed its zenith and must die. But never before, except
per- haps in Egypt, has painting looked so freshly at the face of
nature.</p>
<p>All the arts come together to build the Cretan palaces. Political
power, commercial mastery, wealth and luxury, accumulated refinement and
taste commandeer the architect, the builder, the artisan, the sculptor,
the potter, the metalworker, the woodworker, and the painter to fuse
their skills in pro- ducing an assemblage of royal chambers,
administrative offices, court theaters, and arenas, to serve as the
center and summit of Cretan life. They build in the twenty-first
century, and the twentieth sees their work de- stroyed; they build again
in the seventeenth, not only the palace of Minos but many other splendid
edifices at Cnossus, and in half a hundred other cities in the thriving
island. It is one of the great ages in architectural history.</p>
<p>The creators of the Cnossus palace are limited in both materials and
men. Crete is poor in metal and quite devoid of marble; therefore they
build with limestone and gypsum, and use wood for entablatures, roofs,
and all columns above the basement floor. They cut the stone blocks so
sharply that they can put them together without mortar. Around a central
court of twenty thousand square feet they raise to three or four
stories, with spacious stair- ways of stone, a rambling maze of rooms —
guardhouses, workshops, wine press, storerooms, administrative offices,
servants’ quarters, anterooms, re - ception rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms,
chapel, dungeon, throne room, and a</p>
<p>CRETE</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>“Hall of the Double Ax”; adding near by the conveniences of a
theater, a royal villa, and a cemetery. On the lowest floor they plant
massive square pillars of stone; on the upper floors they use circular
columns of cypress, tapering strangely downward, to support the ceilings
upon smooth round capitals, or to form shady porticoes at the side. Safe
in the interior against a gracefully decorated wall they set a stone
seat, simply but skillfully carved, which eager diggers will call the
throne of Minos, and on which every tourist will modestly seat himself
and be for a moment some inches a king. This sprawling palace in all
likelihood is the famous Labyrinth, or sanctuary of the Double Ax
(labrys) , attributed by the ancients to Daedalus, and destined to give
its name in aftertime to any maze — of rooms, or words, or ears.*”</p>
<p>As if to please the modern spirit, more interested in plumbing than
in poetry, the builders of Cnossus install in the palace a system of
drainage superior to anything else of its kind in antiquity. They
collect in stone con- duits the water that flows down from the hills or
falls from the sky, direct it through shafts to the bathroomsf and
latrines, and lead off the waste in terra-cotta pipes of the latest
style — each section six inches in diameter and thirty inches long,
equipped with a trap to catch the sediment, tapering at one end to fit
into the next section, and bound to this firmly with a necking of
cement.” Possibly they include an apparatus for supplying running hot
water to the household of the king.f”</p>
<p>To the complex interiors the artists of Cnossus add the most delicate
decorations. Some of the rooms they adorn with vases and statuettes,
some with paintings or reliefs, some with huge stone amphorae or massive
urns, some with objects in ivory, faience or bronze. Around one wall
they run a limestone frieze with pretty triglyphs and half rosettes;
around another a panel of spirals and frets on a surface painted to
simulate marble; around another they carve in high relief and living
detail the contests of man and bull. Through the halls and chambers the
Minoan painter spreads all the glories of his cheerful art: here, caught
chattering in a drawing room, are Ladies in Blue, with classic features,
shapely arms, and cozy breasts; here</p>
<p>• The ascription of rooms is, of course, highly conjectural. It
should be added that nearly all the exhumed decorations of the palace
have been removed to the museum at Heracleum or elsewhere, while much of
what remains in site has been tastelessly restored.</p>
<p>t It is no longer agreed that the square depressions found in the
floors of some rooms were baths; they have no outlets, and are made of
gypsum, which water would gradually dissolve.*^ Mosso found similar
drainage pipes in the villa at Hagia Triada. “One day, after a heavy</p>

the Opera, and dolphins swimming motionlessly in the sea. Here, above
all, is the lordly Cupbearer, erect and strong, carrying some precious
ointment in a slim blue vase; his face is chiseled by breeding as well
as by art; his hair descends in ’a thick braid upon his brown shoulders;
his ears, his neck, his arm, and his waist sparkle with jewelry, and his
costly robe is embroidered with a grace- ful quatrefoil design;
obviously he is no slave, but some aristocratic youth proudly privileged
to serve the king. Only a civilization long familiar with order and
wealth, leisure and taste, could demand or create such luxury and such
ornament.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE FALL OF CNOSSUS</li>
</ol>
<p>When in retrospect we seek the origin of this brilliant culture, we
find ourselves vacillating between Asia and Egypt. On the one hand, the
Cretans seem kin in language, race, and religion to the Indo-European
peoples of Asia Minor; there, too, clay tablets were used for writing,
and the shekel was the standard of measurement; there, in Caria, was the
cult of Zeus Labrandeus, i.e., Zeus of the Double Ax (labrys) ; there
men worshiped the pillar, the bull, and the dove; there, in Phrygia, was
the great Cybele, so much like the mother goddess of Crete that the
Greeks called the latter Rhea Cybele, and considered the two divinities
one.“* And yet the signs of Egyptian influence in Crete abound in every
age. The two cultures are at first so much alike that some scholars
presume a wave of Egyptian emigra- tion to Crete in the troubled days of
Menes,“ The stone vases of Mochlos and the copper weapons of Early
Minoan I are strikingly hke those found in Proto-Dynastic tombs; the
double ax appears as an amulet in Egypt, and even a “Priest of the
Double Ax”; the weights and measures, though Asiatic in value, are
Egyptian in form; the methods used in the glyptic arts, in faience, and
in painting are so similar in the two lands that Spengler reduced Cretan
civilization to a mere branch of the Egyptian.“</p>
<p>We shall not follow him, for it will not do, in our Search for the
continu- ity of civilization, to surrender the individuality of the
parts. The Cretan quality is distinct; no other people in antiquity has
quite this flavor of minute refinement, this concentrated elegance in
life and art. Let us believe that in its racial origins the Cretan
culture was Asiatic, in many of its arts Egyptian; in essence and total
it remained unique. Perhaps it belonged to a complex of civilization
common to all the Eastern Mediterranean, in which each nation inherited
kindred arts, beliefs, and ways from a ide- spread neolithic culture
parent to them all. From that common civilization</p>
<p>CRETE</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>CHAP. l)</p>
<p>Crete borrowed in her youth, to it she contributed in her maturity.
Her rule forged an order in the isles, and her merchants found entry at
every port. Then her wares and her arts pervaded the Cyclades, overran
Cyprus, reached to Caria and Palestine,“ moved north through Asia Minor
and its islands to Troy, reached west through Italy and Sicily to
Spain,“ penetrated die mainland of Greece even to Thessaly, and passed
through Mycenae and Tiryns into the heritage of Greece. In the history
of civilization Crete was the first link in the European chain.</p>
<p>We do not know which of the many roads to decay Crete chose; perhaps
she took them all. Her once famous forests of cypress and cedar
vanished; today two thirds of the island are a stony waste, incapable of
holding the winter rains.“ Perhaps there too, as in most declining
cultures, population control went too far, and reproduction was left to
the failures. Perhaps, as wealth and luxury increased, the pursuit of
physical pleasure sapped the vitality of the race, and weakened its wiU
to live or to defend itself; a nadon is bom stoic and dies epicurean.
Possibly the collapse of Egypt after the death of Ikhnaton dismpted
Creto-Egyptian trade, and diminished the riches of the Minoan kings.
Crete had no great internal resources; her prosperity required commerce,
and markets for her industries; like modem England she had become
dangerously dependent upon control of the seas. Perhaps internal wars
decimated the island’s manhood, and left it disunited against foreign
attack. Perhaps an earthquake shook the palaces into ruins, or some
angry revolution avenged in a year of terror the accumulated oppressions
of centuries.</p>
<p>About 1450 the palace of Phaestus was again destroyed, that of Hagia
Triada was burned down, the homes of the rich burghers of Tylissus dis-
appeared. During the next fifty years Cnossus seems to have enjoyed the
zenith of her fortune, and a supremacy unquestioned throughout the
Aegean. Then, about 1400, the palace of Cnossus itself went up in
flames. Everywhere in the rains Evans found signs of uncontrollable fire
— charred beams and pillars, blackened walls, and clay tablets hardened
against time’s tooth by the conflagration’s heat. So thorough was the
destracrion, and so complete the removal of metal even from rooms
covered and protected by debris, that many students suspect invasion and
conquest rather than earth- quake.*“ In any case, the catastrophe was
sudden; the workshops of artists</p>
<p>•If archeological chronology would permit the deferment of this
conflagration to tlie neighborhood of 1250 it would be convenient to
interpret the tragedy as an incident in the Achaean conquest of the
Aegean preliminary to the siege of Troy.</p>

<p>and artisans give every indication of having been in full activity
when death arrived. About the same time Goumia, Pseira, Zakro, and
Palaikastro were leveled to the ground.</p>
<p>We must not suppose that Cretan civilization vanished overnight.
Palaces were built again, but more modestly, and for a generation or two
the pro- ducts of Crete continued to dominate Aegean art. About the
middle of the thirteenth century we come at last upon a specific Cretan
personality — that King Minos of whom Greek tradition told so many
frightening tales. His brides were aimoyed at the abundance of serpents
and scorpions in his seed; but by some secret device his wife Pasiphae
eluded these,“ and safely bore him many children, among them Phaedra
(wife of Theseus and lover of Hippolytus) and the fair-haired Ariadne.
Minos having offended Poseidon, the god afilicted Pasiphae with a mad
passion for a divine bull. Daedalus pitied her, and through his
contrivance she conceived the terrible Minotaur. Minos imprisoned the
animal in the Labyrinth which Daedalus had built at his command, but
appeased it periodically with human sacrifice.“</p>
<p>Pleasanter even in its tragedy is the legend of Daedalus, for it
opens one of the proudest epics of human history. Greek story
represented him as an Athenian Leonardo who, envious of his nephew’s
skill, slew him in a moment of temperament, and was banished forever
from Greece. He found refuge at Minos’ court, astonished him with
mechanical inventions and novelties, and became chief artist and
engineer to the king. He was a great sculptor, and fable used his name
to personify the graduation of statuary from stiff, dead figures to
vivid portraits of possible men; the creatures made by him, we are
informed, were so lifelike that they stood up and walked away unless
they were chained to their pedestals.“ But Minos was peeved when he
learned of Daedalus’ connivance with Pasiphae’s amours, and con - fined
him and his son Icarus in the maze of the Labyrinth. Daedalus</p>
<p>fashioned wings for himself and Icarus, and by their aid they leaped
across the walls and soared ov er the Mediterranean. Disdaining his
father’s coun - sel, proud Icarus flew too closely to the sun; the hot
rays melted the wax on his wings, and he was lost in the sea, pointing a
moral and adorning a tale. Daedalus, empty-hearted, flew on to Sicily,
and stirred that island to civiliza- tion by bringing to it the
industrial and artistic culture of Crete.*“</p>
<p>• Pausanias, father of all Baedekers, credits Daedalus with several
statues, mostly of wood, and a marble relief of Ariadne dancing, as all
extan t in the second century aj).“ The Greeks never doubted the reality
of Daedalus, and the experience of Schliemann warns us to be skeptical
even of our skepticism. Old traditions have a way of being easily
rejected by one generation of scholars, and laboriously confirmed by the
nexL</p>

<p>CHAP.l)</p>
<p>*3</p>
<p>More tragic still is the story of Theseus and Ariadne. Minos,
victorious in a war against youthful Athens, exacted from that city,
every ninth year, a tribute of seven girls and seven young men, to be
devoured by the Minotaur. On the coming of the third occasion for this
national humiliation the handsome Theseus — his father King Aegeus
reluctantly consenting — had himself chosen as one of the seven youths,
for he was resolved to slay the Minotaur and end the recurrent
sacrifice. Ariadne pitied the princely Athenian, loved him, gave him a
magic sword, and taught him the simple trick of unraveling thread from
his arm as he penetrated the Labyrinth. Theseus killed the Minotaur,
followed the thread back to Ariadne, and took her with him on his flight
from Crete. On the isle of Naxos he married her as he had promised, but
while she slept he and his companions sailed treach- erously away.*“</p>
<p>With Ariadne and Minos, Crete disappears from history till the coming
of Lycurgus to the island, presumably in the seventh century. There are
indications that the Achaeans reached it in their long raid of Greece in
the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries, and Dorian conquerors settled
there towards the end of the second millennium before Christ. Here, said
many Cretans and some Greeks,” Lycurgus, arid in less degree Solon, had
found the model for their laws. In Crete as in Sparta, after the island
had come under Dorian sway, the ruling class led a life of at least
outward simplicity and restraint; the boys were brought up in the army,
and the adult miles ate together in public mess halls; the state was
ruled by a senate of elders, and was administered by ten kosmoi or
orderers, corresponding to the ephors of Sparta and the archons of
Athens.” It is difiicult to say whether Crete</p>
<p>hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself out into the
new.</p>
<p>• The Athen ians counted all this as history. They treasured for
centuries, by continually repairing it, the ship in which Theseus had
sailed to Crete, and used it as a sacred vessel in sending envoys
annually to the feast of Apollo at Delos.</p>
