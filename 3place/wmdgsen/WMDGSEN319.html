<p>The Adventure of Reason</p>
<p>1120-1308</p>
<p>I. THE SCHOOL OF CHARTRES</p>
<p>H OW shall we explain the remarkable outburst of philosophy that
began . with Anselm, Roscelin, and Abelard, and culminated in Albertus
Mag- nus and St. Thomas Aquinas? As usual, many causes conspired. The
Greek East had never surrendered its classical heritage; the ancient
philosophers were studied in every century in Constantinople, Antioch,
and Alexandria; men like Michael Psellus, Nicephorus Blemydes (1 197?-!
272), George Pachymeres (i242?-i3io), and the Syrian Bar-Hebraeus
(i2z6?-82) knew the works of Plato and Aristotle at first hand; and
Greek teachers and manu- scripts gradually entered the West. Even there
some fragments of the Hel- lenic legacy had survived the barba rian
storm; most of Aristotle’s Organon of logic remained; and of Plato the
Meno and the Timaeus, whose vision of Er had colored Christian
imaginations of hell. The successive waves of trans- lations from the
Arabic and the Greek in the twelfth arid thirteenth cen- turies brought
to the West the revelation and challenge of Greek and Moslem
philosophies so different from the Christian that they threatened to
sweep away the whole theology of Christendom unless Christianity could
construct a counterphilosophy. But these influences would hardly have
produced a Christian philosophy if the West had continued poor. What
brought these factors to effect was the growth of wealth through the
agricultural conquest of the Continent, the expansion of commerce and
industry, the services a®d accumulations of finance. This economic
revival collaborated with the liberation of the communes, the rise of
the universities, the rebirth of Latin literature and Roman law, the
codification of canon law, the glory of Gothic, the flowering of
romance, the “gay science” of the troubadours, the awaken - ing of
science, and the resurrection of philosophy, to constitute the “Renais -
sance of the twelfth century.”</p>
<p>From wealth came leisure, study, schools; schole at first meant
leisure. A scholasticus was a director or professor of a school; the
“Scholastic philoso - phy” was the philosophy taught in the medieval
secondary schools or in the universities that for the most part grew out
of them. The “Scholastic method” was the form of philosophical argument
and exposition used in such schools. In the twelfth century, barring
Abelard’s classes in or near</p>
<p>949</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>950</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>Paris, Chartres was the most active and famous of these schools.
There phi- losophy was combined with literature, and the graduates
managed to write of abstruse problems with the clarity and grace that
became an honorable tradition in France. Plato, who also had made
philosophy intelligible, was a favorite there, and the quarrel between
realists and nominalists was mediated by identifying the “real”
universals with the Platonic Ideas, or creative</p>
<p>The widening of the Scholastic ken is startlingly revealed in William
of Conches (io8o?-i 154). Here was a man who knew the works of Hippoc-
rates, Lucretius, Hunain ibn Ishaq, Constantine the African, even Democ-
ritus. 1 He was fascinated by the atomic theory; all th§ works of
nature, he concluded, originate in combinations of atoms; and this is
true even of the highest vital processes of the human body. 2 The soul
is a union of the vital principle of the individual with the cosrnic
soul or vital principle of the world. 3 Following Abelard into a
dangerous mystery, William writes: “There is in the Godhead power,
wisdom, and will, which the saints call three persons.” 4 He takes with
a large grain of allegory the story that Eve was created from Adam’s
rib. He answers vigorously a certain Cornificius and other
“Cornificians” who condemned science and philosophy on the ground that
simple faith sufficed.</p>
<p>Because they know not the forces of nature, and in order that
they</p>
<p>may have comrades in their ignorance, they suffer not that others</p>
<p>should search out anything, and would have us believe like rustics
and ask no reason But we say that in all things a reason must be
sought;</p>
<p>if reason fails, we must confide the matter … to the Holy Ghost
and</p>
<p>faith. . . . 5 〔They say〕 “We do not know how this is, but we know
that God can do it.” You poor fools! God can make a cow out of a tree,
but has He ever done so? Therefore show some reason why a thing is so,
or cease to hold that it is so. . . . 8 Rejoicing not in the many but in
the</p>
<p>probity of the few, we toil for truth alone.’’</p>
<p>This was too strong for the stomach of William of St. Thierry; the
zealous monk who had set St. Bernard to hound Abelard hastened to
denounce this new rationalist to the watchful abbot of Clairvaux.
William of Conches re- tracted his heresies, agreed that Eve had been
made from Adam’s rib, 8 aban - doned philosophy as an enterprise in
which the profit was not commensurate with the risk, became tutor to
Henry Plantagenet of England, and retired from history.</p>
<p>Gilbert de la Porree (1 070-1 154) managed the dangerous business
more successfully. He studied and taught at Chartres and Paris, became
Bishop of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 951</p>
<p>Poitiers, and wrote a Liber sex principiorium , or Book of Six
Principles , which remained for many centuries a standard text in logic.
But his Com- mentary on Boethius suggested that the nature of God was so
far beyond human understanding that all statements about it must be
taken as mere analogies, and so stressed the unity of God as to make the
Trinity seem but a figure of speech. 9 In 1 148, though he was now
seventy-two, he was charged with heresy by St. Bernard; he stood trial
at Auxerre, baffled his opponents with subtle distinctions, and went
home uncondemned. A year later he was tried again, consented to burn
certain passages torn from his books, but again returned a free man to
his diocese. When it was suggested that he should discuss his views with
Bernard he refused, saying that the saint was too in- expert a
theologian to understand him. 10 Gilbert, said John of Salisbury, “was
so ripe in liberal culture as to be surpassed by no one.” 11</p>
<p>John might have spoken so for himself, since of all the Scholastic
philos- ophers he possessed the widest culture, the most urbane spirit,
the most ele- gant pen. Bom at Salisbury about 1 1 17, he studied under
Abelard at Mont Ste.-Genevieve, under William of Conches at Chartres,
under Gilbert de la Porree at Paris. In 1149 he returned to England, and
served as secretary to two archbishops of Canterbury, Theobald and
Thomas a Becket. He under- took for them various diplomatic missions,
visited Italy six times, and stayed at the papal court eight years. He
shared Becket’s exile in France, and saw him killed in his cathedral. He
became bishop of Chartres in 1 176, and died in 1180. It was a full and
varied career, in which John learned to check logic with life, and to
take metaphysics with the modesty of an atom judging the cosmos.
Revisiting the schools in his later years, he was amused to find them
still debating nominalism vs. realism.</p>
<p>One never gets away from this question. The world has grown old</p>
<p>discussing it, and it has taken more time than the Caesars consumed
in conquering and governing the world From whatever point a dis-</p>
<p>cussion starts, it is always led back and attached to that. It is the
mad- ness of Rufus about Naevia: “He thinks of nothing else, talks of
noth - ing else; and if Naevia did not exist, Rufus would be dumb.”
12</p>
<p>John himself settled the question simply: the universal is a mental
concept conveniently uniting the common qualities of individual beings;
John, rather than Abelard, proposed “conceptualism.”</p>
<p>In the best Latin since Alcuin’s letters, he composed a his tory of
Greek and Roman philosophy — an astonishing evidence of the widening
medieval horizon; a Metalogicon which lightened logic with
autobiography; and a Polycraticus (1159) whimsically subtitled De nugis
curialium et vestigiis philosophorum — “On the Follies of Courtiers and
the Vestiges of Philos- ophers.” This is the first important essay in
political philosophy in the lit - erature of Christendom. It exposes the
errors and vices of contemporary</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>952</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>govern ments, delineates an ideal state, and describes the ideal man.
“Today,” he consoles us, “everything is bought openly, unless this is
prevented by the modesty of the seller. The unclean fire of avarice
threatens even the sacred altars. . . . Not even the legates of the
Apostolic See keep their hands pure from gifts, but at times rage
through the provinces in bacchanalian frenzy .” 18 If we may believe his
account (already quoted), he told Pope Hadrian IV that the Church shared
liberally in the corruption of the times; to which the Pope in effect
replied that men will be men however gowned. And John adds, wisely: “In
every office of God’s household 〔the Church〕, while some fall behind,
others are added to do their work. Among deacons, archdeacons, bishops,
and legates I have seen some who labored with such earnestness in the
harvest of the Lord that from the merits of their faith and virtue it
could be seen that the vineyard of the Father had been rightly placed
under their care .” 14 Civil governm ent, he thinks, is far more corrupt
than the clergy; and it is good that the Church, for the protection of
the people, should ex- ercise a moral jurisdiction over all the kings
and states of the earth . 15</p>
<p>The most famous passages in the Poly craticus concern
tyrannicide:</p>
<p>If princes have departed little by little from the true way, even so
it</p>
<p>is not well to overthrow them utterly at once, but rather to rebuke
in- justice with patient reproof until finally it becomes obvious that
they are obstinate in their evil-doing. . . . But if the power of the
ruler op- poses the divine commandments, and wishes to make me share in
its war against God, then with unrestrained voice I answer that God must
be preferred before any man on earth. … To kill a tyrant is not</p>
<p>merely lawful, but right and just . 16</p>
<p>This was an unusually excitable outburst for John, and in a later
passage of the same volume he added, “provided that the slayer is not
bound by fealty to the tyrant.” 17 It was a saving clause, for ever y
ruler exacted an oath of fealty from his subjects. In the fifteenth
century Jean Petit defended the assassination of Louis of Orleans by
quoting the Poly craticus-, but the Coun- cil of Constance condemned
Petit on the ground that even the king may not condemn an accused person
without summons and trial.</p>
<p>We “moderns” cannot always agree with the moderni to whom John be -
longed in the twelfth century; he talks now and then what seems to us to
be nonsense; but even his nonsense is couched in a style of such
tolerance and grace as we shall hardly find again before Erasmus. John
too was a hu- manist, loving life more than eternity, loving beauty and
kindness more than the dogmas of any faith, and quoting the ancient
classics with more relish than the sacred page. He made a long list of
dubitabilia — “things about which a wise man may doubt”— and included
the nature and origin of the soul, the creation of the world, the
relation of God’s foresight to man’s free will. But he was too clever to
commit himself to heresy. He moved among the controversies of his time
with diplomatic immunity and charm. He thought</p>
<p>THE ADVENTURE OF REASON</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl)</p>
<p>953</p>
<p>of philosophy not as a form of war but as a balm of peace:
philosophia moderatrix omnium — philosophy was to be a moderating
influence in all things; and “he who has by philosophy reached caritas,
a charitable kindli - ness, has attained to philosophy’s true end.”
18</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ARISTOTLE IN PARIS</li>
</ol>
<p>Toward 1150 one of Abelard’s pupils, Peter Lomb ard, published a book
which was at once a compilation of Abelard’s thought purified of heresy,
and a beginning of the formal Scholastic philosophy. Peter, like Anselm,
Arnold of Brescia, Bonaventura, and Thomas Aquinas, was an Italian who
came to France for advanced work in theology and philosophy. He liked
Abelard, and called the Sic et non his breviary; but also he wanted to
be a bishop. His Sententiarum libri IV, or Four Books of Opinions,
applied and chastened the method of the Sic et non: he drew up under
each question of theology an array of Biblical and Patristic quotations
for and against; but this Peter labored conscientiously to resolve all
contradictions into ortho- dox conclusions. He was made bishop of Paris,
and his book became for four centuries so favorite a text in theological
courses that Roger Bacon reproved it for having displaced the Bible
itself. More than 4000 theologians, in- cluding Albert and Thomas, are
said to have written commentaries on the Sentences.</p>
<p>As the Lomba rd’s book upheld the authority of the Scriptures and the
- physical works into Arabic had in the ninth century compelled Moslem
thinkers to seek a reconciliation between Islamic doctrine and Greek
philos- ophy; and as the impingement of Aristotle upon the Hebrew mind
in Spain was in this twelfth century driving Ibn Daud and Maimonides to
seek a har- mony between Judaism and Hellenic thought; so the arrival of
Aristotle’s works in Latin dress in the Europe of 1 150-12 50 impelled
Catholic theolo- gians to attempt a synthesis of Greek metaphysics and
Christian theology. And as Aristotle seemed immune to scriptural
authority, the theologians were forced to use the language and weapons
of reason. How the Greek philosopher would have smiled to see so many
world-shaking faiths pay homage to his thought!</p>
<p>But we must not exaggerate the influence of Greek thinkers in
stimulat- ing the efflorescence of philosophy in this period. The spread
of education, the vitality of discussion and intellectual life in the
schools and universities of the twelfth century, the stimulus of such
men as Roscelin, William of Champeaux, Abelard, William of Conches, and
John of Salisbury, the en-</p>
<p>954 THE AGE 0F FAITH (chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>largement of horizons by the Crusades, the increasing acquaintance
with Islamic life and thought in East and West — all these could have
produced an Aquinas even if Aristotle had remained unknown; indeed the
industry of Aquinas was due not to love of Aristotle but to fear of
Averroes. Already in the twelfth century the Arabic and Jewish
philosophers were influencing Christian thought in Spain. Al-Kindi,
al-Farabi, al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Ibn Gabirol, Averroes, and Maimonides
entered Latin Europe by the same doors that admitted Plato and
Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, Euclid and Ptolemy.</p>
<p>Such an invasion by alien thought was a mental shock of the first
order to the immature West. We need not wonder that it was met at first
with an attempt at repression or delay; we must marvel rather at the
astonishing feat of adaptation by which the old-new knowledge was
absorbed into the new faith. The initial impact of Aristotle’s Physics
and Metaphysics , and of Averroes’ commentaries, which reached Paris in
the first decade of the thirteenth century, shook the orthodoxy of many
students; and some schol- ars, like Amalric of Bene and David of Dinant,
were moved to attack such basic doctrines of Christianity as creation,
miracles, and personal immortal- ity. The Church suspected that the
seeping of Arabic-Greek thought into south France had loosened orthodoxy
among the educated classes, and had weakened their will to control the
Albigensian heresy. In 1210 a Church council at Paris condemned Amalric
and David, and forbade the reading of Aristotle’s “metaphysics and
natural philosophy,” or of “comments”— commentaries — thereon. As the
prohibition was repeated by a papal legate in 1215 we may assume that
the decree of 1210 had stimulated the reading of these otherwise
forbidding works. The Fourth Council of the Lateran allowed the teaching
of Aristotle’s works on logic and ethics, but proscribed the rest. In
1231 Gregory IX gave absolution to masters and scholars who had
disobeyed these edicts, but he renewed the edicts “provisionally, until
the books of the Philoso pher had been examined and expurgated.” The
three Parisian masters appointed to attend to this fumigation of
Aristotle seem to have abandoned the task. The prohibitions were not
long enforced, for in 1 255 the Physics , Metaphysics, and other works
of Aristotle were required reading at the University of Paris. 19 In
1263 Urban IV restored the prohi- bitions; but apparently Thomas Aquinas
assured him that Aristotle could be sterilized, and Urban did not press
his vetoes. In 1 366 the legates of Urban V at Paris required a thorough
study of the works of Aristotle by all can- didates for the arts degree.
20</p>
<p>The dilemma presented to Latin Christendom in the first quarter of
the thirteenth century constituted a major crisis in the history of the
faith. The rage for the new philosophy was an intellectual fever that
could hardly be controlled. The Church abandoned the effort; instead,
she deployed her forces to surround and absorb the invaders. Her loyal
monks studied this</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 955</p>
<p>amazing Greek who had upset three religions. The Franciscans, though
they preferred Augustine to Aristotle, welcomed Alexander of Hales, who
made the first attempt to harmonize “the Philosopher” with Christianity.
The Dominicans gave every encouragement to Albertus Magnus and Thomas
Aquinas in the same enterprise; and when these three men had finished
their work it seemed that Aristotle had been made safe for
Christianity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE FREETHINKERS</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand Scholasticism as no vain accumulation of dull
abstractions, we must see the thirteenth century not as the unchallenged
field of the great Scholastics, but as a battleground on which, for
seventy years, skeptics, materialists, pantheists, and atheists
contested with the theologians of the Church for possession of the
European mind.</p>
<p>We have noted the presence of unbelief in a small minority t)f the
Euro- pean population. Contact with Islam through the Crusades and the
transla- tions extended this minority in the thirteenth century. The
discovery that another great religion existed, and had produced fine men
like Saladin and al-Kamil, philosophers like Avicenna and Averroes, was
in itself a disturb- ing revelation; comparative religion does religion
no good. Alfonso the Wise (1252-84) reported a common disbelief in
immortality among the Chris- tians of Spain; 21 perhaps Averroism had
trickled down to the people. In southern France there were in the
thirteenth century rationalists who ar- gued that God, after creating
the world, had left its operation to natural law; miracles, they held,
were impossible; no prayer could change the be- havior of the elements;
and the origin of new species was due not to special creation but to
natural development. 22 At Paris some freethinkers — even some priests —
denied transubstantiation; 23 and at Oxford a teacher com- plained that
“there is no idolatry like that of the sacrament of the altar.” 24 Alain
of Lille ( 1 1 1 4- 1 203 ) remarks that “many false Christians of our
time sa y there is no resurrection, since the soul perishes with the
body”; they quoted Epicurus and Lucretius, adopted atomism, and
concluded that the best thing to do is to enjoy life here on earth.
25</p>
<p>The urban industrialism of Flanders seems to have promoted unbelief.
At the beginning of the thirteenth century we find David of Dinant, and
near its end Siger of Brabant, leading a strongly skeptical movement.
David ( c .</p>
<ol start="1200" type="1">
<li>taught philosophy at Paris, and entertained Innocent III with his
subtle disputations. 26 He played with a materialistic pantheism in
which God, mind, and pure matter (matter before receiving form) all
became one in a new trinity. 27 His book, Quaternuli, now lost, was
condemned and burned by the Council of Paris in 1210. The same synod
denounced the pantheism of another Parisian professor, Amalric of Bene,
who had argued</li>
</ol>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>956</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>that God and the creation are one. Amalric was compelled to retract,
and died, we are told, of mortification (1207). 28 The Council had his
bones ex- humed, and burned them in a Paris square as a hint to his many
followers. They persisted nevertheless, and enlarged his views to a
denial of heaven and hell and the power of the sacraments. Ten of these
Amalricians were burned at the stake ( 1 2 10) , 29</p>
<p>Free thought flourished in the southern Italy of Frederick II, where
St. Thomas grew up. Cardinal Ubaldini, friend of Frederick, openly
professed materialism. 80 In northern Italy the industrial workers, the
business classes, the lawyers, and the professors indulged in a measure
of skepticism. The Bolognese faculty was notoriously indifferent to
religion; the medical schools there and elsewhere were centers of doubt;
and an adage arose that ubi tres medici, duo athei — “where there are
three physicians two of them are athe - ists.” 31 About 1240 Averroism
became almost a fashion among the educated</p>
<p>Towards the end of the thirteenth, and throughout the fourteenth and
fif- teenth centuries, the University of Padua was a turbulent center of
Averro- ism. Peter of Abano ( c . 1250-1316), professor of medicine at
Paris and then of philosophy at Padua, wrote in 1 303 a book,
Conciliator controversiarum , designed to harmonize medical and
philosophical theory. He earned a place in the history of science by
teaching that the brain is the source of the nerves, and the heart of
the vessels, and by measuring the year with remark- able accuracy as 365
days, six hours, and four minutes. 34 Convinced of as- trology, he
reduced almost all causation to the power and movement of the stars, and
practically eliminated God from the government of the world. 35
Inquisitors accused him o f heresy, but Marquis Azzo d’Este and Pope Ho
- norius IV were among his patients, and protected him. He was accused
again in 1315, and this time escaped trial by dying a natural death. The
in- quisitors condemned his corpse to be burned at the stake, but his
friends so well concealed his remains that the judgment had to be
executed in effigy. 36</p>
<p>When Thomas Aquinas went from Italy to Paris he discovered that Aver-
roism had long since captured a part of the faculty. In 1240 William
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 957</p>
<p>Auvergne noted that “many men” at the University “swallow these 〔
Aver - roistic〕 conclusions without investigation”; and in 1252 Thomas
found Averroism flourishing among the University youth. 37 Perhaps
alarmed by Thomas’ report, Pope Alexander IV (1256) charged Albertus
Magnus to write a treatise On the Unity of the Intellect Against
Averroes. When Thomas taught at Paris (1252-61, 1269-72) the Averroistic
movement was at its height; its leader in France, Siger of Brabant,
taught in the University from 1266 to 1276. For a generation Averroism
and Catholicism made Paris their battlefield.</p>
<p>Siger (1235?-? 1 281), a secular priest, 38 was a man of learning:
even the surviving fragments of his works quote al-Kindi, al-Farabi,
al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Avempace, Avicebron, Averroes, and Maimonides. In
a series of commentaries on Aristotle, and in a controversial tract
Against Those Fa- mous Men in Philosophy , Albert and Thomas , Siger
argued that Albert and Thomas falsely — Averroes justly — interpreted
the Philosopher. 39 He con- cluded with Averroes that the world is
eternal, that natural law is invari- able, and that only the soul of the
species survives the individual’s death. God, said Siger, is the final,
not the efficient, cause of things — He is the goal, not the cause, of
creation. Led like Vico and Nietzsche by the fascination of logic, Siger
played with the dismal doctrine of eternal recurrence: since (he argued)
all earthly events are ultimately determined by stellar combi- nations,
and the number of these possible combinations is finite, each com-
bination must be exactly repeated again and again in an infinity of
time, and must bring in its train the same effects as before; “the same
species” will return , “the same opinions, laws, religions.” 40 Siger
was careful to add: “We say this according to the opinion of the
Philosopher, but without affirming that it is true.” 41 To all his
heresies he appended a similar caution. He did not profess the doctrine
of two truths; he taught certain conclusions as, in his judgment,
following from Aristotle and reason; when these conclusions contradicted
the Christian creed he affirmed his belief in the dogmas of the Church,
and applied only to them, not to philosophy, the label of truth. 42</p>
<p>That Siger had a large following at the University is evident from
his candidacy for the rectorship (1271), though it failed. Nothing could
better prove the strength of the Averroistic movement in Paris than its
repeated denunciation by the Bishop of Paris, fitienne Tempier. In 1269
he con- demned as heresies thirteen propositions taught by certain
professors in the University:</p>
<p>That there is only one intellect in all men. . . . That the world
is</p>
<p>eternal. . . . That there never was a first man. . . . That the soul
is cor- rupted with the corruption of the body. . . . That the will of
man wills and chooses from necessity. . . . That God does not know
individual</p>
<p>events. . . . That human actions are not ruled by Divine Providence’.
48</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>958</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>Apparently the Averroists continued to teach as before, for in 1277
the Bishop issued a list of 219 propositions which he officially
condemned as heresies. These, according to the Bishop, were doctrines
taught by Siger, or Boethius of Dacia, or Roger Bacon, or other Parisian
professors, includ- ing St. Thomas himself. The 219 included those
condemned in 1269, and others of which the following are samples:</p>
<p>That creation is impossible. . . . That a body once corrupted
〔in</p>
<p>death〕 cannot rise again as the same body That a future
resurrec-</p>
<p>tion should not be believed by a philosopher, since it cannot be
investi- gated by reason. . . . That the words of theologians are
founded on</p>
<p>fables That nothing is added to our knowledge by theology</p>
<p>That the Christian religion impedes learning. . . . That happiness is
ob- tained in this life, not in another. . . . That the wise men of the
earth are</p>
<p>philosophers alone That there is no more excellent condition than</p>
<p>to have leisure for philosophy. 44</p>
<p>In October, 1277, Siger was condemned by the Inquisition. He passed
his last years in Italy as a prisoner of the Roman Curia, and was
murdered at Orvieto by a half-mad assassin. 45</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOLASTICISM</li>
</ol>
<p>To meet this frontal attack upon Christianity it was not enough to
con- demn the heretical propositions. Youth had tasted the strong wine
of phi- losophy; could it be won back by reason? As the mutakallimun had
defended Mohammedanism from the Mutazilites, so now Franciscan and
Dominican theologians, and secular prelates like William of Auvergne and
Henry of Ghent, came to the defense of Christianity and the Church.</p>
<p>The defense divided itself into two main camps: the mystic-Platonic,
mostly Franciscans; and the intellectual-Aristotelian, mostly
Dominicans. Benedictines like Hugh and Richard of St. Victor felt that
the best defense of religion lay in man’s direct consciousness of a
spiritual reality deeper than all intellectual fathoming. “Rigorists”
like Peter of Blois and Stephen of Toumai argued that philosophy should
not discuss the problems of theol- ogy, or, if it did, it should speak
and behave as a modest servant of theology — ancilla theologiae. 4 * It
should be noted that this view was held by only a sector of the
Scholastic front. 47</p>
<p>A few Franciscans, like Alexander of Hales (1 i7o?-i245), adopted the
intellectual approach, and sought to defend Christianity in
philosophical and Aristotelian terms. But most Franciscans distrusted
philosophy; they felt that the adventure of reason, whatever strength
and glory it might bring to the Church for a time, might later elude
control, and lead men so far from faith as to leave Christianity weak
and helpless in an unbelieving and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 959</p>
<p>unmoral world. They preferred Plato to Aristotle, Bernard to Abelard,
Au- gustine to Aquinas. They defined the soul, with Plato, as an
independent spirit inhabiting, and thwarted by, the body, and they were
shocked to hear Thomas accepting Aristotle’s definition of the soul as
the “substantial form” of the body. They found in Plato a theory of
impersonal immortality quite useless for checking the bestial impulses
of men. Following Augustine, they ranked will above intellect in both
God and man, and aimed at the good rather than the true. In their
hierarchy of values the mystic came closer than the philosopher to the
secret essence and significance of life.</p>
<p>This Platonic- Augustinian division of the Scholastic army dominated
or- thodox theology in the first half of the thirteenth century. Its
ablest exponent was the saintly Bonaventura — a gentle spirit who
persecuted heresy, a mystic writing philosophy, a scholar who deprecated
learning, a lifelong friend and opponent of Thomas Aquinas, a defender
and exemplar of evangelical poverty under whose ministry the Franciscan
Order made great gains in corporate wealth. Born in Tuscany in 1221,
Giovanni di Fidanza came for some unknown reason to be called
Bonaventura — Good Luck. He nearly died of a childhood malady; his
mother prayed to St. Francis for his recov- ery; Giovanni thereafter
felt that he owed his life to the saint. Entering the Order, he was sent
to Paris to study under Alexander of Hales. In 1 248 he began to teach
theology in the University; in 1257, still a youth of thirty- six, he
was chosen minister-general of the Franciscans. He did his best to
reform the laxity of the Order, but was too genial to succeed. He
himself lived in ascetic simplicity. When messengers came to announce
that he had been made a cardinal they found him washing dishes. A year
later (1274) he died of overwork.</p>
<p>His books were well written, clear, and concise. He pretended to be a
mere compiler, but he infused order, fervor, and a disarming modesty
into every subject that he touched. His Breviloquiutn was an admirable
summary of Christian theology; his Soliloquium and Itinerarium mentis in
Deum (Journey of the Mind to God) were jewels of mystic piety. True
knowl- edge comes not through perception of the material world by the
senses, but through intuition of the spiritual world by the soul. While
loving St. Thomas, Bonaventura frowned upon the reading of philosophy,
and freely criticized some of Aq uinas’ conclusions. He reminded the
Dominicans that Aristotle was a heathen, whose authority must not be
ranked with that of the Fathers; and he asked could the philosophy of
Aristotle explain a moment’s move - ments of a star? 48 God is not a
philosophical conclusion but a living pres- ence; it is better to feel
Him than to define Him. The good is higher than the true, and simple
virtue surpasses all the sciences. One day, we are told, Brother Egidio,
overwhelmed by Bonaventura’s learning, said to him: “Alas! what shall we
ignorant and simple ones do to merit the favor of God?” “My brother,”
replied Bonaventura, “you know very well that it suffices to love</p>
<p>9^0 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>the Lord.” “Do you then believe,” asked Egidio, “that a simple woman
might please him as well as a master in theology?” When the theologian
answered in the affirmative, Egidio rushed into the street and cried out
to a beggar woman: “Rejoice, for if you love God, you may have a higher
place in the Kingdom of Heaven than Brother Bonaventura!” 49</p>
<p>Obviously it is a mistake to think of “the” Scholastic philosophy as
a</p>
<p>dreary unanimity of opinion and approach. There were a hundred
Scholastic philosophies. The same university faculty might harbor a
Thomas honor- ing reason, a Bonaventura deprecating it, a William of
Auvergne (1180- 1 249) following Ibn Gabirol into voluntarism, a Siger
teaching Averroism. The divergences and conflicts within orthodoxy were
almost as intense as between faith and unbelief. A Franciscan bishop,
John Peckham, would de- nounce Aquinas as sternly as Thomas denounced
Siger and Averroes; and Albertus Alagnus, in an unsaintly moment, wrote:
“There are ignorant men who would fight by every means the employment of
philosophy; and par- ticularly the Franciscans — brutish beasts who
blaspheme that which they do not know.” 60</p>
<p>Albert loved knowledge, and admired Aristotle this side of heresy. It
was he who first among the Scholastics surveyed all the major works of
the Phi- losopher, and undertook to interpret them in Christian terms.
He was born at Lauingen, Swabia, about 1201, son of the rich count of
Bollstadt. He studied at Padua, joined the Dominican Order, and taught
in Dominican schools at Hildesheim, Freiburg, Ratisbon, Strasbourg,
Cologne (1228-45), and Paris (1245-8). Despite his preference for the
scholastic life he was made Provincial of his Order for Germany, and
Bishop of Ratisbon ( 1 260) . Tradition claims that he walked barefoot
on all his journeys. 51 In 1262 he was allowed to retire to a cloister
at Cologne. He left its peace when he was seventy-six (1277) to defend
the doctrine and memory of his dead pupil Thomas Aquinas at Paris. He
succeeded, returned to his monastery, and died at seventy-nine. His
devoted life, unassuming character, and vast in- tellectual interests
show medieval monasticism at its best.</p>
<p>Only the quiet routine of his monastic years, and the massive
diligence of German scholarship, can explain how a man who spent so much
of his time in teaching and administration could write essays on almost
every phase of science, and substantial treatises on every branch of
philosophy and the- ology.* Few men in history have written so much, or
borrowed so much, or so frankly acknowledged their debts. Albert bases
his works almost title</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 961</p>
<p>for title on Aristotle; he uses Averroes’ commentaries to interpret
the Phi - losopher; but he corrects both of them manfully when they
differ from Christian theology. He draws on the Moslem thinkers to such
an extent that his works are an important source for our knowledge of
Arabic philosophy. He cites Avicenna on every other page, and
occasionally Maimonides’ Guide to the Perplexed. He recognizes Aristotle
as the highest authority in science and philosophy, Augustine in
theology, the Scriptures in everything. His immense mound of discourse
is poorly organized, and never becomes a con- sistent system of thought;
he defends a doctrine in one place, attacks it in another, sometimes in
the same treatise; he had no time to resolve his con- tradictions. He
was too good a man, too pious a soul, to be an objective thinker; he was
capable of following a commentary on Aristotle with a long treatise in
twelve “books” In Praise of the Blessed Virgin Mary , in which he argued
that Mary had a perfect knowledge of grammar, rhetoric, logic,
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.</p>
<p>What, then, was his achievement? Above all, as we shall see, he
contributed substantially to the scientific research and theory of his
time. In philosophy he “gave Aristotle to the Latins”— which was all
that he aimed to do; he promoted the use of Aristotle in the teaching of
philosophy; he accumu- lated the storehouse of pagan, Arabic, Jewish,
and Christian thought and argument from which his famous pupil drew for
a more lucid and orderly synthesis. Perhaps without Albert, Thomas would
have been impossible.</p>
<p>V. THOMAS AQUINAS</p>
<p>Like Albert, Thomas came of lordly stock, and gave up riches to
win</p>
<p>eternity. His father, Count Landulf of Aquino, belonged to the German
nobility, was a nephew of Barbarossa, and was among the highest figures
at the Apulian court of the impious Frederick II. His mother was
descended from the Norman princes of Sicily. Though born in Italy,
Thomas was on both sides of northern origin, essentially Teutonic; he
had no Italian grace or deviltry in him, but grew to heavy German
proportions, with large head, broad face, and blond hair, and a quiet
content in intellectual industry. His friends called him “the great dumb
ox of Sicily.” 52</p>
<p>He was born in 1225 in his father’s castle at Roccasecca, three miles
from Aquino, and halfway between Naples and Rome. The abbey of Monte
Cas- sino was near by, and there Thomas received his early schooling. At
four- teen he began five years of study at the University of Naples.
Michael Scot was there, translating Averroes into Latin; Jacob Anatoli
was there, trans- lating Averroes into Hebrew; Peter of Ireland, one of
T homas’ teachers, was an enthusiastic Aristotelian; the University was
a hotbed of Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew influences impinging upon
Christian thought. Thomas’ broth -</p>
<p>962 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>ers took to poetry; one, Rainaldo, became a pa ge and falconer at
Frederick’s court, and begged Thomas to join him there. Piero delle
Vigne and Fred- erick himself seconded the invitation. Instead of
accepting, Thomas entered the Dominican Order ( 1 244) . Soon thereafter
he was sent to Paris to study theology; at the outset of his journey he
was kidnaped by two of his broth- ers at their mother’s urging; he was
taken to the Roccasecca castle, and was kept under watch there for a
year. 63 Every means was used to shake his vo- cation; a story, probably
a legend, tells how a pretty young woman was introduced into his chamber
in the hope of seducing him back to life, and how, with a flaming brand
snatched from the hearth, he drove her from the room, and burned the
sign of the cross into the door. 64 His firm piety won his mother to his
purposes; she helped him to escape; and his sister Marotta, after many
talks with him, became a Benedictine nun.</p>
<p>At Paris he had Albert the Great as one of his teachers (1245). When
Albert was transferred to Cologne Thomas followed him, and continued to
study with him there till 1252. At times Thomas seemed dull, but Albert
defended him, and prophesied his greatness. 66 He returned to Paris to
teach as a bachelor in theology; and now, following in his master’s
steps, he began a long series of works presenting Aristotle’s philosophy
in Christian dress. In 1259 he left Paris to teach at the studium
maintained by the papal court now in Anagni, now in Orvieto, now in
Viterbo. At the papal court he met William of Moerbeke, and asked him to
make Latin translations of Aristotle directly from the Greek.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Siger of Brabant was leading an Averroistic revolution at
the University of Paris. Thomas was sent up to meet this challenge.
Reaching Paris, he broug ht the war into the enemy’s camp with a tract
On the Unity of the Intellect Against the Averroists (1270). He
concluded it with un- usual fire:</p>
<p>Behold our refutation of these errors. It is based not on
documents</p>
<p>of faith but on the reasons and statements of the philosophers them-
selves. If, then, there be anyone who, boastfully taking pride in
his</p>
<p>supposed wisdom, wishes to challenge what we have written, let him
not do it in some corner, nor before children who are powerless to de-
cide on such difficult matters. Let him reply openly if he dare. He
shall find me here confronting him, and not only my negligible self,
but</p>
<p>many another whose study is truth. We shall do battle with his
errors, and bring a cure to his ignorance. 56</p>
<p>It was a complex issue, for Thomas, in this his second period of
teaching at Paris, had not only to combat Averroism, but also to meet
the attacks of fellow monks who distrusted reason, and who rejected
Thomas’ claim that Aristotle could be harmonized with Christianity. John
Peckham, successor to Bonaventura in the Franciscan chair of philosophy
at Paris, upbraided Thomas for sullying Christian theology with the
philosophy of a pagan.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 963</p>
<p>Thomas — Peckham later reported — stoo d his ground, but answered
“with great mildness and humility.” 57 Perhaps it was those three years
of contro - versy that undermined his vitality.</p>
<p>In 1272 he was called back to Italy at the request of Charles of
Anjou to reorganize the University of Naples. In his final years he
ceased writing, whether through weariness or through disillusionment
with dialectics and argument. When a friend urged him to complete his
Summa theologica he said: “I cannot; such things have been revealed to
me that what I have writ- ten seems but straw.” 58 In 1274 Gregory X
summoned him to attend the Council of Lyons. He set out on the long mule
ride through Italy; but on the way between Naples and Rome he grew weak,
and took to his bed in the Cistercian monastery of Fossanuova in the
Campagna. There, in 1274, still but forty-nine, he died.</p>
<p>When he was canonized witnesses testified that he “was soft -spoken,
easy in conversation, cheerful and bland of countenance . . . generous
in con- duct, most patient, most prudent; radiant with charity and
gentle piety; wondrous compassionate to the poor.” 59 He was so
completely captured by piety and study that these filled every thought
and moment of his waking day. He attended all the hours of prayer, said
one Mass or heard two each morning, read and wrote, preached and taught,
and prayed. Before a sermon or a lecture, before sitting down to study
or compose, he prayed; and his fellow monks thought that “he owed his
knowledge less to the effort of the mind than to the vi rtue of his
prayer.” 60 On the margin of his manuscripts we find, every now and
then, pious invocations like Ave Maria! 61 He be- came so absorbed in
the religious and intellectual life that he hardly noticed what happened
about him. In the refectory his plate could be removed and replaced
without his being aware of it; but apparently his appetite was ex-
cellent. Invited to join other clergymen at dinner with Louis IX, he
lost him- self in meditation during the meal; suddenly he struck the
table with his fist and exclaimed: “That is the decisive argument
against the Manicheans!” His prior reproved him: “You are sitting at the
table of the King of France”; but Louis, with royal courtesy, bade an
attendant bring writing materials to the victorious monk. 62
Nevertheless the absorbed saint could write with good sense on many
matters of practical life. People remarked how he could adjust his
sermons either to the studious minds of his fellow monks, or to the
simple intellects of common folk. He had no airs, made no demands upon
life, sought no honors, refused promotion to ecclesiastical office. His
writ- ings span the universe, but contain not one immodest word. He
faces in them every argument against his faith, and answers with
courtesy and calm.</p>
<p>Improving upon the custom of his time, he made explicit
acknowledgments of his intellectual borrowings. He quotes Avicenna,
al-Ghazali, Averroes, Isaac Israeli, Ibn Gabirol, and Maimonides;
obviously no student can under- stand the Scholastic philosophy of the
thirteenth century without consider-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>964</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>ing its Moslem and Jewish antecedents. Thomas does not share William
of Auvergne’s affection for “Avicebron,” but he has a high respect for
“Rabbi Moyses,” as h e calls Moses ben Maimon. He follows Maimonides in
hold- ing that reason and religion can be harmonized, but also in
placing certain mysteries of the faith beyond the grasp of reason; and
he cites the argument for this exclusion as given in the Guide to the
Perplexed . es He agrees with Maimonides that the human intellect can
prove God’s existence, but can never rise to a knowledge of His
attributes; and he follows Maimonides closely in discussing the eternity
of the universe. 64 * In logic and metaphys- ics he takes Aristotle as
his guide, and quotes him on almost every page; but he does not hesitate
to differ from him wherever the Philosopher strays from Christian
doctrine. Having admitted that the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
Redemption, and the Last Judgment cannot be proved by reason, he
proceeds on all other points to accept reason with a fullness and
readiness that shocked the followers of Augustine. He Was a mystic in so
far as he acknowledged the suprarationality of certain Christian dogmas,
and shared the mystic long- ing for union with God; but he was an
“intellectualist” in the sense that he preferred the intellect to the
“heart” as an organ for arriving at truth. He saw that Europe was bound
for an Age of Reason, and he thought that a Christian philosopher should
meet the new mood on its own ground. He prefaced his reasonings with
Scriptural and Patristic authorities, but he said, with pithy candor:
Locus ab auctoritate est inftrmissimus — “the argument from authority is
the wea kest .” 60 “The study of philosophy,” he wrote, “does not aim
merely to find out what others have thought, but what the truth of the
matter is .” 67 His writings rival those of Aristotle in the sus -
tained effort of their logic.</p>
<p>Seldom in history has one mind reduced so large an area of thought to
order and clarity. We shall find no fascination in Thomas’ style; it is
simple and direct, concise and precise, with not a word of padding or
flourish; but we miss in it the vigor, imagination, passion, and poetry
of Augustine. Thomas thought it out of place to be brilliant in
philosophy. When he wished he could equal the poets at their own game.
The most perfect works of his pen are the hymns and prayers that he
composed for the Feast of Corpus Christi. Among them is the stately
sequence Lauda Sion salvatorem, which preaches the Real Presence in
sonorous verse. In the Lauds is a hymn beginning with a line from
Ambrose — V erbum supernum prodiens — and end- ing with two stanzas — O
salutaris hostia — regularly sung at the Benediction of the Sacrament.
And in the Vespers is one of the great hymns of all time, a moving
mixture of theology and poetry:</p>

<p>966 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>Dionysius; on Aristotle’s Organon, Of Heaven and Earth, Of Generation
and Corruption, Meteorology, Physics, Metaphysics, On the Soul,
Politics, Ethics-, quaestiones disputatae — On Truth, On Power, On Evil,
On the Mind, On Virtues, etc.; quodlibeta discussing points raised at
random in university sessions; treatises On the Principles of Nature, On
Being and Essence, On the Rule of Princes, On the Occult Operations of
Nature, On the Unity of the Intellect, etc.; a four-volume Sunima de
veritate catholicae fidei contra Gentiles (1258-60), a twenty-one-volume
Summa theologica (1267-73), and a Compendium theologiae (1271- 3).
Thomas’ published writings fill 10,000 double-column folio pages.</p>
<p>The Summa contra Gentiles, or Summary of the Catholic Faith Against
the Pagans, was prepared at the urging of Raymond of Penafort, General
of the Dominican Order, to aid in the conversion of Moslems and Jews in
Spain. Therefore Thomas in this work argues almost entirely from reason,
though remarking sadly that “this is deficient in the things of God.” 68
He abandons here the Scholastic method of disputation, and presents his
mate- rial in almost modern style, occasionally with more acerbity than
befitted him whom posterity would call doctor angelicus and seraphicus.
Christian- ity must be divine, he thinks, because it conquered Rome and
Europe de- spite its unwelcome preaching against the pleasures of the
world and the flesh; Islam conquered by preaching pleasure and by force
of arms. 69 In Part IV he frankly admits that the cardinal dogmas of
Christianity cannot be proved by reason, and require faith in the divine
revelation of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures.</p>
<p>Thomas’ m ost extensive work, the Summa theologica, is addressed to
Christians; it is an attempt to expound and to defend — from Scripture,
the Fathers, and reason — the whole body of Catholic doctrine in
philosophy and theology.* “We shall try,” says the Prologue, “to follow
the things that per - tain to sacred doctrine with such brevity and
lucidity as the subject matter allows.” We may smile at this twenty
-one-volume brevity, but it is there; this Summa is immense, but not
verbose; its size is merely the result of its scope. For within this
treatise on theology are full treatises on metaphys- ics, psychology,
ethics, and law; thirty-eight treatises, 631 questions or topics, 10,000
objections or replies. The orderliness of argument within each question
is admirable, but the structure of the Summa has received more praise
than its due. It cannot compare with the Euclidean organization of
Spinoza’s Ethics, - or the concatenation of Spencer’s Synthetic
Philosophy. The treatise on psychology (Part I, QQ. 75-94) is introduced
between a discussion of the six days of creation and a study of man in
the state of orig- inal innocence. The form is more interesting than the
structure. Essentially it continues, and perfects, the method of Abelard
as developed by Peter * The Summa to and including Part III, Question
90, is by Thomas; the remainder may be by Reginald of Pipemo, his
companion and editor.</p>

<p>Lombard: statement of the question, arguments for the negative,
objections to the affirmative, arguments for the affirmative from the
Bible, from the Fathers, and from reason, and answers to objections. The
method occasion- ally wastes time by putting up a straw man to beat
down; but in many cases the debate is vital and real. It is a mark of
Thomas that he states the case against his own view with startling
candor and force; in this way the Summa is a summary of heresy as well
as a monument of dogma, and might be used as an arsenal of doubt. We may
not always be satisfied with the answers, but we can never complain that
the Devil has had an incompetent advocate.</p>

<li>THE THOMIST PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>I. Logic</p>
<p>What is knowledge? Is it a divine light infused into man by God,
without which it would be impossible? Thomas parts company at the very
outset from Augustine, the mystics, the intuitionists: knowledge is a
natural product, derived from the external corporeal senses and the
internal sense called consciousness of the self. It is an extremely
limited knowledge, for up to our time no scientist yet knows the essence
of a fly ; 70 but within its limits knowledge is trustworthy, and we
need not fret over the possibility that the external world is a
delusion. Thomas accepts the Scholastic definition of truth as adequatio
rei et intellectus — the equiv- alence of the thought with the thing .
71 Since the intellect draws all its natural knowledge from the senses ,
72 its direct knowledge of things outside itself is lim - ited to bodies
— to the “sensible” or sensory world. I t cannot directly know the
super-sensible, meta-physical world — the minds within bodies, or God in
His creation; but it may by analogy derive from sense experience an
indirect knowl- edge of other minds, and likewise of God . 73 Of a third
realm, the supernatural — the world in which God lives — the mind of man
can have no knowledge except through divine revelation. We may by
natural understanding know that God exists and is one, because His
existence and unity shine forth in the wonders and organization of the
world; but we cannot by unaided intellect know His essence, or the
Trinity. Even the knowledge of the angels is limited, for else they
would be God.</p>
<p>The very limitations of knowledge indicate the existence of a
supernatural world. God reveals that world to us in the Scriptures. Just
as it would be folly for the peasant to consider the theories of a
philosopher false because he cannot understand them, so it is foolish
for man to reject God’s revelation on the ground that it seems at some
po ints to contradict man’s natural knowledge. We may be confident that
if our knowledge were complete there would be no contradiction between
revelation and philosophy. It is wrong to say that a proposition can be
false in philosophy and true in faith; all truth comes from God and is
one. Never- theless it is desirable to distinguish what we understand
through reason and what we believe by faith ; 74 the fields of
philosophy and ideology are distinct. It is per- missible for scholars
to discuss among th emselves objections to the faith, but “it is</p>
<p>968 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>not expedient for simple people to hear what unbelievers have to say
against the faith,” for simple minds are not equipped to answer. 75
Scholars and philosophers, ( as well as peasants, must bow to the
decisions of the Church; “we must be directed j by her in all things”;
76 for she is the divinely appointed repository of divine wis - dom. To
the pope belongs the “authority to decide matters of faith finally, so j
that they may be held by all with unshaken belief.” 77 The alternative
is intellec - | tual, moral, and social chaos.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Metaphysics</li>
</ol>
<p>The metaphysics of Thomas is a complex of difficult definitions and
subtle dis - tinctions, on which his theology is to rest.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In created things essence and existence are different. Essence is
that which is necessary to the conception of a thing; existence is the
act of being. The essence of a triangle — that it is three straight
lines enclosing a space — is the same whether the triangle exists or is
merely conceived. But in God essence and existence are one; for His
essence is that He is the First Cause, the underlying power (or, as
Spinoza would say, sub-stcmtia) of all things; by definition He must
exist in order that anything else should be.</p></li>
<li><p>God exists in reality; He is the Being of all beings, their
upholding cause. All other beings exist by analogy, by limited
participation in the reality of God.</p></li>
<li><p>All created beings are both active and passive — i.e., they act
and are acted upon. Also, they are a mixture of being and becoming: they
possess certain quali- ties, and may lose some of these and acquire
others — water may be warmed. Thomas denotes this susceptibility to
external action or internal change by the term potentia — possibility.
God alone has no potentia or possibility; He cannot be acted upon,
cannot change; He is actus purus, pure activity; pure actuality; He is
already everything that He can be. Below God all entities can be ranged
in a de- sc ending scale according to their greater “possibility” of
being acted upon and determined from without. So man is superior to
woman because “the father is the active principle, while the mother is a
passive and material principle; she supplies the formless matter of the
body, which receives its form through the formative power that is in the
semen of the father.” 78</p></li>
<li><p>All corporeal beings are composed of matter and form; but here
(as in Aris- totle) form means not figure but inherent energizing,
characterizing principle. When a form or vital principle constitutes the
essence of a being, it is a substantial or essential form; so the
rational soul — i.e., a life-giving force capable of thought — is the
substantial form of the human body, and God is the substantial form of
the world.</p></li>
<li><p>All realities are either substance or accident: either they are
separate entities, like a stone or a man; or they exist only as
qualities in something else, like white- ness or density. God is pure
substance, as the only completely self-existent reality.</p></li>
<li><p>All substances are individuals; nothing but individuals exists
except in idea; the notion that individuality is a delusion is a
delusion.</p></li>
<li><p>In beings composed of matter and form, the principle or source of
individu- ation — i.e., of the multiplicity of individuals in a species
or class — is matter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 969</p>
<p>Throughout the species the form or vital principle is essentially the
same; in each individual this principle uses, appropriates, gives shape
to, a certain quantity and figure of matter; and this materia signata
quantitate , or matter marked off by quantity, is the principle of
individuation — not of individuality but of separate identity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Theology</li>
</ol>
<p>God, not man , is the center and theme of Thomas’ philosophy. “The
highest knowledge we can have of God in this life,” he writes, “is to
know that He is above all that we can think concerning Him.” 79 He
rejects Anselm’s ontological argument, 80 but he comes close t o it in
identifying God’s existence with His es - sence. God is Being itself: “I
am Who am.”</p>
<p>His existence, says Thomas, can be proved by natural reason. ( 1 )
All motions are caused by previous motions, and so on either to a Prime
Mover unmoved, or to an “infinite regress,” which is inconceivable. (2)
The series of causes likewise requires a First Cause. (3) The
contingent, which may but need not be, depends upon the necessary, which
must be; the possible depends upon the actual; this series drives us
back to a necessary being who is pure actuality. (4) Things are good,
true, noble in various degrees; there must be a perfectly good, true,
and noble source and norm of these imperfect virtues. (5) There are
thousands of evi- dences of order in the world; even inanimate objects
move in an orderly way; how could this be unless some intelligent power
exists who created them? * 81</p>
<p>Aside from the existence of God, Thomas is almost an agnostic in
natural the- ology. “We cannot know what God is, but only what He is
not” 82 — not movable, multiple, mutable, temporal. Why should
infinitesimal minds expect to know more about the Infinite? It is hard
for us to conceive an immaterial spirit, said Thomas (anticipating
Bergson), because the intellect is dependent upon the senses, and all
our external experience is of material things; consequently “incor -
poreal things, of which there are no images, are known to us by
comparison with sensible bodies, of which there are images.” 88 We can
know God (as Maimon ides taught) only by analogy, reasoning from
ourselves and our experience to Him; so if there is in men goodness,
love, truth, intelligence, power, freedom, or any other excellence,
these must be also in man’s Creator, and in such greater degree in Him
as corresponds to the proportion between infinity and ourselves. We
apply the masculine pronouns to God, but only for convenience; in God
and the angels there is no sex. God is one because by definition He is
existence itself, and the unified operation of the world reveals one
mind and law. That there are three Persons in this divine unity is a
mystery beyond reason, to be held in trusting faith.</p>
<p>Nor can we know whether the world was created in time, and therefore
out of nothing, or whether, as Aristotle and Averroes thought, it is
eternal. The argu- ments offered by the theologians for creation in time
are weak, and should be rejected “lest the Catholic faith should seem to
be founded on empty reason -</p>

<p>970 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>ings.” 84 Thomas concludes that we must believe on faith in a
creation in time; but he adds that the question has little meaning,
since time had no existence before creation; without change, without
matter in motion, there is no time. He strug- gles manfully to explain
how God could pass from noncreation to creation with- out suffering
change. The act of creation, he says, is eternal, but it included in its
willing the determination of the time for its effect to appear 85 — a
nimble dodge for a heavy man.</p>
<p>The angels constitute the highest grade of creation. They are
incorporeal in- telligences, incorruptible and immortal. They serve as
ministers of God in the government of the world; the heavenly bodies are
moved and guided by them ; 86 every man has an angel appointed to guard
him, and the archangels have the care of multitudes of men. Being
immaterial, they can travel from one extremity of space to another
without traversing the space between. Thomas writes ninety- three pages
on the hierarchy, movements, love, knowledge, will, speech, and hab- its
of the angels — the most farfetched part of his far-flung Summa , and
the most irrefutable.</p>
<p>As there are angels, so there are demons, little devils doing Satan’s
will. They are no mere imaginings of the common mind; they are real, and
do endless harm. They may cause impotence by arousing in a man a
repulsion for a woman . 87 They make possible various forms of magic; so
a demon may lie under a man, receive his semen, carry it swiftly through
space, cohabit with a woman, and impregnate her with the seed of the
absent man . 88 Demons can enable magicians to foretell such events as
do not depend upon man’s free will. They can communicate infor- mation
to men by impressions on the imagination, or by appearing visibly or
speaking audibly. Or they may co-operate with witches, and help them to
hurt children through the evil eye . 89</p>
<p>Like nearly all his contemporaries, and most of ours, Thomas allowed
consid- erable truth to astrology.</p>
<p>The movements of bodies here below . . . must be referred to the</p>
<p>movements of the heavenly bodies as their cause That astrologers</p>
<p>not infrequently forecast the truth by observing the stars may be ex-
plained in two ways. First, because a great number of men follow</p>
<p>their bodily passions, so that their actions are for the most part
dis-</p>
<p>posed in accordance with the inclination of the heavenly bodies;
while there are few — namely, the wise alone — who moderate these
inclina- tions by their reason. . . . Secondly, because of the
interference of</p>
<p>demons . 00</p>
<p>However, “human actions are not subject to the action of heavenly
bodies save accidentally and indirectly”; 91 a large area is left to
human freedom.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Psychology</li>
</ol>
<p>Thomas considers carefully the philosophical problems of psychology,
and his pages on these topics are among the best in his synthesis. He
begins with an or-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 971</p>
<p>ganic, as against a mechanical, conception of organisms: a machine is
composed of externally added parts; an organism makes its own parts, and
moves itself by its own internal force . 92 This internal formative
power is the soul. Thomas ex- presse s the idea in Aristotelian terms:
the soul is the “substantial form” of the - ment, and understanding .”
93 There are three grades of soul: the vegetative— the power to grow;
the sensitive — the power to feel; the rational^ the power to rea- son.
All life has the first, only animals and men have the second, only men
have the third. But the higher organisms, in their corporeal and
individual develop- ment, pass through the stages in which the lower
organisms remain; “the higher a form is in the scale of being . . . the
more intermediate forms must be passed through before the perfect form
is reached” 94 — an adumbration of the nineteenth- century theory of
“recapitulation,” that the embryo of man passes through the stages by
which the species developed.</p>
<p>Whereas Plato, Augustine, and the Franciscans thought of the soul as
a pris- oner within the body, and identified the man with the soul
alone, Thomas boldly accepts the Aristotelian view, and defines man —
even personality — as a composite of body and soul, matter and form . 95
The soul, or life-giving, form-creating inner energy, is indivisibly in
every part of the body . 96 It is bound up with the body in a thousand
ways. As vegetable soul it depends upon food; as sensitive soul it
depends upon sensation; as rational soul it needs the images produced
by, or com- pounded from, sensation. Even intellectual ability and moral
perceptions depend upon a body reasonably sound; a thick skin usually
implies an insensitive soul . 97 Dreams, passions, mental diseases,
temperament, have a physiological basis . 98 At times Thomas speaks as
if body and soul were one unified reality, the inward energy and outward
form of an indivisible whole. Nevertheless it seemed obvious to him that
the rational soul — abstracting, generalizing, reasoning, charting the
universe — is an incorporeal reality. Try as we will, and despite our
tendency to think of all things in material terms, we can find nothing
material in conscious - ness; it is a reality all the world unlike
anything physical or spatial. This rational soul must be classed as
spiritual, as something infused into us by that God Who is the psychical
force behind all physical phenomena. Only an immaterial power could form
a universal idea, or leap backward and forward in time, or conceive with
equal ease the great and the small . 99 The mind can be conscious of
itself; but it is impossible to conceive a material entity as conscious
of itself.</p>
<p>Therefore it is reasonable to believe that this spiritual force in us
survives the death of the body. But the soul so separated is not a
personality; it cannot feel or will or think; it is a helpless ghost
that cannot function without its flesh . 100 Only when it is reunited,
through the resurrection of the body, with the corporeal frame of which
it was the inward life, will it constitute with that body an indi-
vidual and deathless personality. It was because Averrocs and his
followers lacked faith in the resurrection of the body that they were
driven to the theory that only the “active intellect,” or soul of the
cosmos or species, is immortal. Thoma s de- ploys all the resources of
his dialectic to refute this theory. To him this conflict with Averroes
over immortality was the vital issue of the century, beside which</p>
<p>97^ THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>such mere shiftings of boundaries and titles as physical battles
brought were a trivial lunacy.</p>
<p>The soul, says Thomas, has five faculties or powers: vegetative, by
which it feeds, grows, and reproduces; sensitive, by which it receives
sensations from the external world; appetitive, by which it desires and
wills; locomotive, by which it initiates motions; and intellectual, by
which it thinks . 101 All knowledge originates in the senses, but the
sensations do not fall upon an empty surface or tabula rasa ; they are
received by a complex structure, the sensus communis , or common sen-
sory center, which co-ordinates sensations or perceptions into ideas.
Thomas agrees with Aristotle and Locke that “there is nothing in the
intellect that was not</p>
<p>Will or appetition is the faculty by which the soul or vital force
moves toward that which the intellect conceives as good. Thomas,
following Aristotle, defines the good as “that which is desirable.” 102
Beauty is a form of the good; it is that</p>
<p>5 . Ethics</p>
<p>The proper end of man, therefore, is in this life the acquisition of
truth, and in the afterlife to see this Truth in God. For assuming, with
Aristotle, that what man seeks is happiness, where shall he best find
it? Not in bodily pleasures, nor in hon- ors, nor in wealth, nor in
power, nor even in actions of moral virtue, though all of these may give
delight. Let us grant, too, that “perfect disposition of the body is
necessary … for perfect happine ss.” 107 But none of these goods can
compare with the quiet, pervasive, continuing happiness of
understanding. Perhaps re- membering Virgil’s Felix qui potuit rerum
cognoscere causas—’ “happy he who has been able to know the causes of
things”— Thomas believes that the highest achievement and satisfaction
of the soul — the natural culmination of its peculiar rationality —
would be this, “that on it should be inscribed the total order of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI ) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 973</p>
<p>universe and its causes .” 108 The peace that passeth understanding
comes from understanding.</p>
<p>But even this supreme mundane bliss would leave man not quite
content, still unfulfilled. Vaguely he knows that “perfect and true
happiness cannot be had in this life.” There is that in him which
undiscourageably longs for a happiness and an understanding that shall
be secure from mortal vicissitude and change. Other appetites may find
their peace in intermediate goods, but the mind of the full man will not
rest except it come to that sum and summit of truth which is God . 100
In God alone is the supreme good, both as the source of all other goods,
and as the cause of all other causes, the truth of all truths. The final
goal of man is the Beatific Vision — the vision that gives bliss.</p>
<p>Consequently all ethics is the art and science of preparing man to
attain this cul- minating and everlasting happiness. Moral goodness,
virtue, may be defined as conduct conducive to the true end of man,
which is to see God. Man naturally inclines to the good — the desirable;
but what he judges to be good is not always morally good. Through Eve’s
false judgment of the good, man disobeyed God, and now bears in every
generation the taint of that first sin.* If at this point one asks why a
God who foresees all should have created a man and a woman destined to
such curiosity, and a race destined to such heritable guilt, Thomas
answers that it is metaphysically impossible for any creature to be
perfect, and that man’s free - dom to sin is the price he must pay for
his freedom of choice. Without that free- dom of will man would be an
automaton not beyond but below good and evil, having no greater dignity
than a machine.</p>
<p>Steeped in the doctrine of original sin, steeped in Aristotle,
steeped in monastic isolation and terror of the other sex, it was almost
fated that Thomas should think ill of woman, and speak of her with
masculine innocence. He follows the climactic egotism of Aristotle in
supposing that nature, like a medieval patriarch, always wishes to
produce a male, and that woman is something defective and accidental (
deficiens et occasionatum); she is a male gone awry ( mas
occasionatum) prob- ably she is the result of some weakness in the
father’s generative power, or of some external factor, like a damp south
wind . 111 Relying on Aristotelian and con- temporary biology, Thomas
supposed that woman contributed only passive mat- ter to the offspring,
while the man contributed active form; woman is the tri- umph of matter
over form. Consequently she is the weaker vessel in body, mind, and
will. She is to man as. the senses are to reason. In her the sexual
appetite pre- dominates, while man is the expression of the more stable
element. Both man and woman are made in the image of God, but man more
especially so. Man is the principle and end of woman, as God is the
principle and end of the universe. She needs man in everything; he needs
her only for procreation. Man can accomplish all tasks better than woman
— even the care of the home . 112 She is unfitted to fill any vital
position in Church or state. She is a part of man, literally a rib . 113
She should look upon man as her natural master, should accept his
guidance and sub-</p>

Immaculate Con- ception of the Virgin — i.e., her freedom from the taint

<p>mit to his corrections and discipline. In this she will find her
fulfillment and her happiness.</p>
<p>As to evil, Thomas labors to prove that metaphysically it does not
exist. Malum est non ens , evil is no positive entity; every reality, as
such, is good ; 114 evil is merely the absence or privation of some
quality or power that a being ought nat- urally to have. So it is no
evil for a man to lack wings, but an evil for him to lack hands; yet to
lack hands is no evil for a bird. Everything as created by God is good,
but even God could not communicate His infinite perfection to created
things. God permits certain evils in order to attain good ends or to
prevent greater evils, just “as human governments . . , rightly tolerate
certain evils”— like prosti- tution — “lest . . . greater evils be
incurred.” 115</p>
<p>Sin is an act of free choice violating the order of reason, which is
also the order of the universe. The order of reason is the proper
adjustment of means to ends. In man’s case it is the adjustment of
conduct to win eternal happiness. God gives us the freedom to do wrong,
but He also gives us, by a divine infusion, a sense of right and wrong.
This innate conscience is absolute, and must be obeyed at all costs. If
the Church commands something against a man’s conscience he must dis -
obey. If his conscience tells him that faith in Christ is an evil thing,
he must abhor that faith . 116</p>
<p>Normally conscience inclines us not only to the natural virtues of
justice, pru- dence, temperance, and fortitude, but also to the
theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity. These last three
constitute the distinguishing morality and glory of Christianity. Faith
is a moral obligation, since human reason is limited. Man must believe
on faith not only those dogmas of the Church that are above reason, but
those too that can be known through reason. Since error in matters of
faith may lead many to hell, tolerance should not be shown to unbelief
except to avoid a greater evil; so “the Church at times has tolerated
the rites even of heretics and pagans, when unbelievers were very
numerous.” 117 Unbelievers should never be allowed to acquire dominion
or authority over believers . 118 Tolerance may espe- cially be shown to
Jews, since their rites prefigured those of Christianity, and so “bear
witness to the faith .” 119 Unbaptized Jews should never be forced to

<p>totle; as we read on we are astonished at the amount of original and
incisive thought contained in his work.</p>
<p>Social organization is a tool that man developed as a substitute for
physiological organs of acquisition and defense. Society and the state
exist for the individual, not he for them. Sovereignty comes from God,
but is vested in the people. The people, however, are too numerous,
scattered, fickle, and uninformed to exercise this sovereign power
directly or wisely; hence they delegate their sovereignty to a prince or
other leader. This grant of power by the people is always revocable, and
“the prince holds the power of legislating only so far as he represents
the will of the people.” 123</p>
<p>The sovereign power of the people may be delegated to many, to a few,
or to one. Democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy may all be good if the
laws are good and well administered. In general a constitutional
monarchy is best, as giving unity, continuity, and stabil ity; “a
multitude,” as Homer said, “is better governed by one than by several.”
124 The prince or king, however, should be chosen by the people from any
free rank of the population . 125 If the monarch becomes a tyrant he
should be overthrown by the orderly action of the people . 126 He must
always remain the servant, not the master, of the law.</p>
<p>Law is threefold: natural, as in the “natural laws” of the universe;
divine, as revealed in the Bible; human or positive, as in the
legislation of states. The third was made necessary by the passions of
men and the development of the state. So the Fathers believed that
private property was opposed to natural and divine law, and was the
result of the sinfulness of man. Thomas does not admit that property is
unnatural. He considers the arguments of the communists of his time, and
an- swers like Aristotle that when everybody owns everything nobody
takes care of anything . 127 But private property is a public trust.
“Man ought to possess external things not as his own but as common, so
that he is ready to communicate them to others in their need.” 128 For a
man to desire or pursue wealth beyond his need for maintaining his
station in life is sinful covetousness . 129 “Whatever some people</p>
<p>Thomas was not the man to make economics a dismal science by
divorcing it from morality. He believed in the right of the community to
regulate agriculture, industry, and trade, to control usury, even to
establish a “just price” for services and goods. He looked with
suspicious eye upon the art of buying cheap and sell- ing dear. He
condemned outright all speculative trading, all attempts to make gain by
skillful use of market fluctuations . 131 He opposed lending at
interest, but saw no sin in borrowing “for a good end” from a
professional moneylender . 132</p>
<p>He did not rise above his time on the question of slavery. Sophists,
Stoics, and Roman legists had taught that by “nature” all men are free;
the Church Fathers had agreed, and had explained slavery, like property,
as a result of the sinfulness acquired by man through Adam’s Fall.
Aristotle, friend of the mighty, had jus - tified slavery as produced by
the natural inequality of men. Thomas tried to reconcile these views: in
the state of innocence there was no slavery; but since the Fall it has
been found useful to subject simple men to wise men; those who have</p>
<p>97 6 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>strong bodies but weak minds are intended by nature to be bondmen .
133 The slave, however, belongs to his master only in body, not in soul;
the slave is not obliged to give sexual intercourse to the master; and
all the precepts of Chris- tian morality must be applied in the
treatment of the slave.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>As economic and political problems are ultimately moral, it seems
just to Thomas that religion should be ranked above politics and
industry, and that the state should submit, in matters of morals, to
supervision and guidance by the Church. Authority is nobler, the higher
its end; the kings of the earth, guidi ng men to earthly bliss, should
be subject to the pope, who guides men to everlasting happiness. The
state should remain supreme in secular affairs; but even in such matters
the pope has the right to intervene if rulers violate the rules of
morality, or do avoidable injury to their peoples. So the pope may
punish a bad king, or absolve subjects from their oath of allegiance.
Moreover, the state must protect religion, support the Church, and
enforce her decrees . 134</p>
<p>The supreme function of the Church is to lead men to salvation. Man
is a citizen not alone of this earthly state but of a spiritual kingdom
infinitely greater than any state. The supreme facts of history are that
man committed an infinite crime by disobeying God, thereby meriting
infinite punishment; and that God the Son, by becoming man and suffering
ignominy and death, created a redeeming store of grace by which man can
be saved despite original sin. God gives of this grace to whom He will;
we cannot fathom the reasons of His choic e; but “nobody has been so
insane as to say that merit is the cause of divine predestination.” 135
The</p>
<p>It is fitting that God should predestine men. For all things are
sub-</p>
<p>ject to His Providence As men are ordained to eternal life
through</p>
<p>the Providence of God, it likewise is part of that Providence to
permit some to fall away from that end; this is called reprobation As
pre-</p>
<p>destination includes the will to confer grace and glory, so also
repro- bation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and
to</p>
<p>impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin. . . . “He
chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.” 136</p>
<p>Thomas struggles to reconcile divine predestination with human
freedom, and to explain why a man whose fate is already sealed should
strive to virtue, how prayer can move an unchangeable God, or what the
function of the Church can be in a society whose individuals have
already been sorted out into the saved and the damned. He answers that
God has merely foreseen how each man would freely choose. Presumably all
pagans are among the damned except possibly a few to whom God vouchsafed
a special and personal revelation.* 137</p>
<ul>
<li>The oft-quoted passage about the blessed in heaven enhancing their
bliss by observing the sufferings of the damned occurs in the Summa’s
Supplement (xcvii, 7 ), and is to be discredited not to Thomas but to
Reginald of Piperno . 138</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 977</p>
<p>The chief happiness of the saved will consist in seeing God. Not that
they will understand Him; only infinity can understand infinity;
nevertheless, by an in- fusion of divine grace, the blessed will see the
essence of God. 139 The whole cre- ation, having proceeded from God,
flows back to Him; the human soul, gift of His bounty, never rests until
it rejoins its source. Thus the divine cycle of creation and return is
completed, and Thomas’ philosophy ends, as it began, with God.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The Reception of Thomism</li>
</ol>
<p>It was received by most of his contemporaries as a monstrous
accumula- tion of pagan reasonings fatal to the Christian faith. The
Franciscans, who sought God by Augustine’s mystic road of love, were
shocked by Thomas’ “intellectualism,” his exaltation of intellect above
will, of understanding above love. Many wondered how so coldly negative
and remote a God as the Actus Purus of the Summa could be prayed to, how
Jesus could be part of such an abstraction, what St. Francis would have
said of — or to — such a God. To make body and soul one unity seemed to
put out of court the in- corruptible immortality of the soul; to make
matter and form one unity was, despite Thomas’ denials, to fall into the
Averroistic theory of the eter - nity of the world; to make matter, not
form, the principle of individuation seemed to leave the soul
undifferentiated, and to fall into the Averroistic theory of the unity
and impersonal immortality of the soul. Worst of all, the triumph of
Aristotle over Augustine in the Thomist philosophy seemed to the
Franciscans the victory of paganism over Christianity. Were there not
already, in the University of Paris, teachers and students who put Aris-
totle above the Gospels?</p>
<p>Just as orthodox Islam, at the end of the twelfth century, denounced
and banished the Aristotelian Averroes, and orthodox Judaism, at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, burned the books of the
Aristotelian Maimonides, so in the third quarter of that century
Christian orthodoxy defended itself against the Aristotelian Thomas. In
1 277, at the prompting of Pope John XXI, the bishop of Paris issued a
decree branding 219 propositions as her- esies. Among these were three
expressly charged “against Brother Thomas”: that angels have no body,
and constitute each of them a separate species; that matter is the
principle of individuation; and that God cannot multiply in- dividuals
in a species without matter. Anyone holding these doctrines, said the
bishop, was ipso facto excommunicated. A few days after this decree
Robert Kilwardby, a leading Dominican, persuaded the masters of the Uni-
versity of Oxford to denounce various Thomistic doctrines, including the
unity of soul and body in man.</p>
<p>Thomas was now three years dead, and could not defend himself; but
his old teacher Albert rushed from Cologne to Paris, and persuaded the
Domin- icans of France to stand by their fellow friar. A Franciscan,
William de la Mare, joined the fray with a tract called Correctorium
fratris Thomae , set-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>978</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVI</p>
<p>ting Thomas right on 1 1 8 points; and another Franciscan, John
Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, officially condemned Thomism, and
urged a return to Bonaventura and St. Francis. Dante entered the lists
by making a modified Thomism the doctrinal framework of The Divine
Comedy, and choosing Thomas to guide him on the stairway to the highest
heaven. After half a hundred years’ war the Dominicans convinced Pope
John XXII that Thomas had been a saint; and his canonization (1323) gave
the victory to Thomism. Thereafter the mystics found in the Summa 140
the deepest and clearest exposition of the mystic-contemplative life. At
the Council of Trent (1545-63) the Summa theologica was placed upon the
altar together with the Bible and the Decretals. 141 Ignatius Loyola
imposed upon the Jesuit Order the obligation to teach Thomism. In 1 879
Pope Leo XIII, and in 1921 Pope Benedict XV, while not pronouncing the
works of St. Thomas free from all error, made them the official
philosophy of the Catholic Church; and in all Roman Catholic colleges
that philosophy is taught today. Tho- mism, though it has some critics
among Catholic theologians, has won new defenders in our time, and now
rivals Platonism and Aristotelianism as one of the most enduring and
influential bodies of philosophical thought.</p>
<p>It is a simple matter for one who stands on the shoulders of the last
700 years to point out in the work of Aquinas those elements that have
ill borne the test of time. It is both a defect and a credit that he
relied so much on Aristotle: to that degree he lacked originality, and
showed a courage that cleared new paths for the medieval mind. Carefully
securing direct and accurate translations, Thomas knew Ari stotle’s
philosophical (not the sci - entific) works more thoroughly than any
other medieval thinker except Averroes. He was willing to learn from
Moslems and Jews, and treated their philosophers with a self-confident
respect. There is a heavy ballast of non- sense in his system, as in all
philosophies that do not agree with our own; it is strange that so
modest a man should have written at such length on how the angels know,
and what man was before the Fall, and what the human race would have
been ex cept for Eve’s intelligent curiosity. Perhaps we err in thinking
of him as a philosopher; he himself honestly called his work the- ology;
he made no pretense to follow reason wherever it should lead him; he
confessed to starting with his conclusions; and though most philosophers
do this, most denounce it as treason to philosophy. He covered a wider
range than any thinker except Spencer has dared to do again; and to
every field he brought the light of clarity, and a quiet temper that
shunned exaggera- tion and sought a moderate mean. Sapientis est
ordinare, he said — “the wise man creates order.” 142 He did not succeed
in reconciling Aristotle and Chris - tianity, but in the effort he won
an epochal victory for reason. He had led reason as a captive into the
citadel of faith; but in his triumph he had brought the Age of Faith to
an end.</p>

<p>THE ADVENTURE OF REASON</p>
<p>979</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE SUCCESSORS</li>
</ol>
<p>The historian always oversimplifies, and hastily selects a manageable
mi- nority of facts and faces out of a crowd of souls and events whose
multitu- dinous complexity he can never quite embrace or comprehend. We
must not think of Scholasticism as an abstraction purged of a thousand
individual peculiarities, but as a lazy name for the hundreds of
conflicting philosoph- ical and theological theories taught in the
medieval schools from Anselm in the eleventh century to Occam in the
fourteenth. The historian is miserably subject to the brevity of time
and human patience, and must dishonor with a line men who were immortal
for a day, but now lie hidden between the peaks of history.</p>
<p>One of the strangest figures of the many-sided thirteenth century was
Ramon Lull — Raymond Lully (12 3 2? — 1 315). Born in Palma of a wealthy
Catalan family, he found his way to the court of James II at Barcelona,
en- joyed a riotous youth, and slowly narrowed his amours to monogamy.
Sud- denly, at the age of thirty, he renounced the world, the flesh, and
the Devil to devote his polymorphous energy to mysticism, occultism,
philanthropy, evangelism, and the pursuit of martyrdom. He studied
Arabic, founded a college of Arabic studies in Majorca, and petitioned
the Council of Vienne ( 1 3 1 1 ) to set up schools of Oriental
languages and literature to prepare men for missionary work among
Saracens and Jews. The Council established five such schools — at Rome,
Bologna, Paris, Oxford, and Salamanca — with chairs of Hebrew, Chaldaic,
and Arabic. Perhaps Lully learned Hebrew, for he be- came an intimate
student of the Cabala.</p>
<p>His 1 50 works defy classification. In youth he founded Catalan
literature with several volumes of love poetry. He composed in Arabic,
and then trans- lated into Catalan, his Libre de contemplacio en Deu, or
Book of Contempla- tion on God — no mere mystic revery but a
million-word encyclopedia of theology (1272). Two years later, as if
with another self, he wrote a manual of chivalric war — Libre del orde
de cavalyeria-, and almost at the same time a handbook of education —
Liber doctrinae puerilis. He tried his hand at philosophical dialogue,
and published three such works, presenting Moslem, Jewish, Greek
Christian, Roman Christian, and Tatar points of view with astonishing
tolerance, fairness, and kindliness. About 1283 he composed a long
religious romance, Blanqnerna, which patient experts have pronounced
“one of the masterpieces of the Christian Middle Ages.” 143 At Rome in 1
295 he issued another encyclopedia, the Arbre de sciencia, or Tree of
Science , stating 4000 questions in sixteen sciences, and giving
confident replies. Dur- ing a stay in Paris ( 1 309-1 1 ) he fought the
lingering Averroism there with some minor theological works, which he
signed, with unwonted accuracy, Phantasticus. Throughout his long life
he poured forth so many volumes</p>
<p>980 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>on science and philosophy that even to list them would empty the
pen.</p>
<p>Amid all these interests he was fascinated by an idea that has
captured bril- liant minds in our own time — that all the formulas and
processes of logic could be reduced to mathematical or symbolical form.
The ars magna, or “great art” of logic, said Raymond, consists in
writing the basic concepts of human thought on movable squares, and then
combining these in various positions not only to reduce all the ideas of
philosophy to equations and diagrams, but to prove, by mathematical
equivalence, the truths of Christi- anity. Raymond had the gentleness of
some lunatics, and hoped to convert Mohammedans to Christianity by the
persuasive manipulations of his ars. The Church applauded his
confidence, but frowned upon his proposal to reduce all faith to reason,
and to put the Trinity and the Incarnation into his logical machine.
144</p>
<p>In 1 292, resolved to balance the loss of Palestine to the Saracens
by peace- ably converting Moslem Africa, Raymond crossed to Tunis, and
secretly organized there a tiny colony of Christians. In 1 307, on one
of his missionary trips to Tunisia, he was arrested and brought before
the chief judge of Bou- gie. The judge arranged a public disputation
between Raymond and some Moslem divines; Raymond, says his biographer,
won the argument, and was thrown into jail. Some Christian merchants
contrived his rescue, and brought him back to Europe. But in 1314,
apparently longing for martyrdom, he crossed again to Bougie, preached
Christianity openly, and was stoned to death by a Moslem mob (1315).</p>
<p>To pass from Raymond Lully to John Duns Scotus is like emerging from
Carmen into the Well-Tempered Clavichord. John’s middle and last names
came from his birth (1266?) at Duns in Berwickshire (?). He was sent at
eleven to a Franciscan monastery at Dumfries; four years later he
entered the Order. He studied at Oxford and Paris, and then taught at
Oxford, Paris, and Cologne. Then, still a youth of forty-two, he died
(1308), leaving be- hind him a multiplicity of writings, chiefly on
metaphysics, distinguished by such obscurity and subtlety as would
hardly appear again in philosophy before the coming of another Scot. And
indeed the function of Duns Scotus was very much like that of Kant five
centuries later — to argue that the doc- trines of religion must be
defended by their practical-moral necessity rather than their logical
cogency. The Franciscans, willing to jettison philosophy to save
Augustine from Dominican Thomas, made their young Doctor Sub- tilis
their champion, and followed his lead, alive and dead, through genera-
tions of philosophical war.</p>
<p>This Duns was one of the keenest minds in medieval history. Having
studied mathematics and other sciences, and feeling the influence of
Grosse- teste and Roger Bacon at Oxford, he formed a severe notion of
what con- stituted proof; and applying that test to the philosophy of
Thomas, he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVl) THE ADVENTURE OF REASON 981</p>
<p>ended, almost in its honeymoon, the rash marriage of theology with
philoso- phy. Despite his clear understanding of the inductive method,
Duns argued — precisely contrary to Francis Bacon — that all inductive
or a posteriori proof — from effect to cause — is uncertain; that the
only real proof is deduc- tive and a priori — to show that certain
effects must follow from the essential nature of the cause. For example,
to prove the existence of God, we must first study metaphysics — i.e.,
study “being as being,” and by strict logic ar - rive at the essential
qualities of the world. In the realm of essences there must be one which
is the source of all the rest, the Primus ; this First Being is God.
Duns agrees with Thomas that God is Actus Purus, but he interprets the
phrase not as Pure Actuality but as Pure Activity. God is primarily will
rather than intellect. He is the cause of all causes, and is eternal.
But that is all that we can know of Him by reason. That He is a God of
Mercy, that He is Three in One, that He created the world in time, that
He watches over all by Providence — these and practically all the
doctrines of the Christian faith are credibilia; they should be believed
on the authority of the Scriptures and the Church, but they cannot be
demonstrated by reason. Indeed, the mo- ment we begin to reason about
God we run into baffling contradictions (the Kantian “antinomies of pure
reason”). If God is omnipotent He is the cause of all defects, including
all evil; and secondary causes, including the human will, are illusory.
In view of these ruinous conclusions, and because of the necessity of
religious belief for our moral life (Kant’s “practical reason”), it is
wiser to abandon the Thomistic attempt to prove theology by philoso-
phy, and to accept the dogmas of the faith on the authority of the Bible
and the Church . 145 We cannot know God, but we can love Him, and that
is better than knowing . 146</p>
<p>In psychology Duns is a “realist” after his own s ubtle fashion:
universals are objectively real in the sense that those identical
features, which the mind abstracts from similar objects to form a
general idea, must be in the objects, else how could we perceive and
abstract them? He agrees with Thomas that all natural knowledge is
derived from sensation. For the rest he differs from him all along the
psychologic line. The principle of individuation is not mat- ter but
form, and form only in the strict sense of thisness (haecceitas ) — the
peculiar qualities and distinguishing marks of the individual person or
thing. The faculties of the soul are not distinct from one another, nor
from the soul itself. The basic faculty of the soul is not understanding
but will; it is the will that determines to what sensations or purposes
the intellect is to at- tend; only the will (voluntas), not the judgment
(arbitrium), is free.</p>
<p>Thomas’ argument that our hunger for continuance and for perfect
happi - ness proves the immortality of the soul proves too much, for it
could be applied to any beast in the field. We cannot prove personal
immortality; we must simply believe . 147</p>
<p>As the Franciscans had claimed to see in Thomas the victory of
Aristotle</p>
<p>982 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVI</p>
<p>over the Gospels, so the Dominicans might have seen in Duns the
triumph of Arabic over Christian philosophy: his metaphysic is
Avicenna’s, his cos - mology is Ibn Gabirol’s. But the tragic and basic
fact in Scotus is his aban - donment of the attempt to prove the basic
Christian doctrines by reason. His followers cairried the matter
further, and removed one after another of the articles of faith from the
sphere of reason, and so multiplied his distinctions and subtleties that
in England a “Dunsman” came to mean a hairsplitting fool, a dull
sophist, a dunce. Those who had learned to love philosophy re- fused to
be subordinated to theologians who rejected philosophy; the two studies
quarreled and parted; and the rejection of reason by faith issued in the
rejection of faith by reason. So ended, for the Age of Faith, the brave
adventure.</p>
<p>Scholasticism was a Greek tragedy, whose nemesis lurked in its
essence. The attempt to establish the faith by reason implicitly
acknowledged the authority of reason; the admission, by Duns Scotus and
others, that the faith could not be established by reason shattered
Scholasticism, and so weakened the faith that in the fourteenth century
revolt broke out all along the doc- trinal and ecclesiastical line.
Aristotle’s philosophy was a Greek gift to Latin Christendom, a Trojan
horse concealing a thousand hostile elements. These seeds of the
Renaissance and the Enlightenment were not only “the revenge</p>
<p>But no perspective can dim the splendor of the Scholastic enterprise.
It was an undertaking as bold and rash as youth, and had youth’s faults
of over - confidence and love of argument; it was the voice of a new
adolescent Europe that had rediscovered the exciting game of reason.
Despite heresy- hunting councils and inquisitors, Scholasticism enjoyed
and displayed, dur- ing the two centuries of its exaltation, a freedom
of inquiry, thought, and teaching hardly surpassed in the universities
of Europe today. With the help of the jurists of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries it sharpened the Western mind by forging the tools
and terms of logic, and by such subtle reasoning as nothing in pagan
philosophy could excel. Certainly this facility in argu- ment ran to
excess, and generated the disputatious verbosity and “scholas - tic”
hairsplitting against which not only Roger and Francis Bacon, but the
Middle Ages themselves, rebelled.* Yet the good of the inheritance far
out- weigh ed the bad. “Logic, ethics, and metaphysics,” said Condorcet,
“owe</p>

<li>Giraldus Cambrensis tells of a youth who, at his father’s painful
expense, studied phi - losophy for five years at Paris, and, returning
home, proved to his father, by remorseless logic, that the six eggs on
the table were twelve; whereupon the father ate the six eggs that he
could see, and left the others for his son . 148</li>

<p>to Scholasticism a precision unknown to the ancients themselves”; and
“it is to the Schoolmen,” said Sir William Hamilton, “that the vulgar
lan - guages are indebted for what precision and analytical subtlety
they pos- sess.” 149 The peculiar quality of the French mind— its love
of logic, its clarity, its finesse — was in large measure formed by the
heyday of logic in the schools of medieval France . 160</p>
<p>Scholasticism, which in the seventeenth century was to be an obstacle
to the development of the European mind, was in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries a revol utionary advance, or restoration, in human
thought. “Mod - ern” thought begins with the rationalism of Abelard,
reaches its first peak</p>
