<h4 id="chapter-xxii">CHAPTER XXII</h4>
<p>A Christian Epilogue</p>
<p>I. THE JOLLY BUCCANEERS</p>
<p>The arrival of the Europeans — The British Conquest — The Sepoy</p>
<p>Mutiny — Advantages and disadvantages of British rule</p>
<p>I N many ways that civilization was already dead when Clive and Hast-
ings discovered the riches of India. The long and disruptive reign
of</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, and the chaos and internal wars that followed it, left
India ripe for reconquest; and the only question open to “manifest
destiny” was as to which of the modernized powers of Europe should
become its instrument. The French tried, and failed; they lost India, as
well as Can- ada, at Rossbach and Waterloo. The English tried, and
succeeded.</p>
<p>In 1498 Vasco da Gama, after a voyage of eleven months from Lisbon,
anchored off Calicut. He was well received by the Hindu Raja of Mala-
bar, who gave him a courteous letter to the King of Portugal: “Vasco da
Gama, a nobleman of your household, has visited my kingdom, and has
given me great pleasure. In my kingdom there is abundance of cinnamon,
cloves, pepper, and precious stones. What I seek from your country is
gold, silver, coral and scarlet.” His Christian majesty answered by
claim - ing India as a Portuguese colony, for reasons which the Raja was
too backward to understand. To make matters clearer, Portugal sent a
fleet to India, with instructions to spread Christianity and wage war.
In the seventeenth century the Dutch arrived, and drove out the
Portuguese; in the eighteenth the Fr ench and English came, and drove
out the Dutch. Savage ordeals of battle decided which of them should
civilize and tax the Hindus.</p>
<p>The East India Company had been founded in London in 1600 to buy
cheap in India, and sell dear in Europe, the products of India and the
East Indies.* As early as 1686 it announced its intentio n “to establish
a large, well-grounded, sure English dominion in India for all time
to</p>
<p>come.”* It set up trading -posts at Madras, Calcutta and Bombay,
fortified # Goods bought for ,000,000 in India were sold for 0,000,000
in England. 1 The stock of the Company rose to 2,000 a share. 3</p>

<p>614 the STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.XXn</p>
<p>them, imported troops, fought battles, gave and took bribes, and
exercised other functions of government. Clive gayly accepted “presents”
amount - ing to 70,000 from Hindu rulers dependent upon his guns;
pocketed from them, in addition, an annual tribute of 40,000; appointed
Mir Jafar ruler of Bengal for ,000,000; played one native prince against
an- other, and gradually annexed their territories as the property of
the East India Company; took to opium, was investigated and exonerated
by Par- liament, and killed himself (1774)/ Warren Hastings, a man of
courage, learning and ability, exacted contributions as high as a
quarter of a mil- lion dollars from native princes to the coffers of the
Company; accepted bribes to exact no more, exacted more, and annexed the
states that could not pay; he occupied Oudh with his army, and sold the
province to a prince for ,500,000’ — conquered and conqueror rivaled
each other in venality. Such parts of India as were under the Company
were subjected to a land tax of fifty per cent of the produce, and to
other requisitions so numerous and severe that two-thirds of the
population fled, while others sold their childre n to meet the rising
rates.’ “Enormous fortunes,” says Macaulay, “were rapidly accumulated at
Calcutta, while thirty millions of human beings were reduced to the
extremity of wretchedness. They had been accustomed to live under
tyranny, but never under tyranny like this.’”</p>
<p>By 1857 the crimes of the Company had so impoverished northeastern
India that the natives broke out in desperate revolt. The British
Govern- ment stepped in, suppressed the “mutiny,” took over the captured
terri - tories as a colony of the Crown, paid the Company handsomely,
and added the purchase price to the public debt of India. 8 It was
plain, blunt conquest, not to be judged, perhaps, by Commandments
recited west of Suez, but to be understood in terms of Darwin and
Nietzsche: a people that has lost the ability to govern itself, or to
develop its natural re-</p>
<p>sources, inevitably falls a prey to nations suffering from strength
and greed.</p>
<p>The conquest brought certain advantages to India. Men like Bentinck,
Cannin g, Munro, Elphinstone and Macaulay carried into the administra-
tion of the British provinces something of the generous liberalism that
con- trolled England in 1832. Lord William Bentinck, with the aid and
stimu- lus of native reformers like Ram Mohun Roy, put an end to suttee
and thuggery. The English, after fighting 111 wars in India, with
Indian</p>
<p>money and troops, 8 to complete the conquest of India, established
peace</p>
<p>CHAP, xxrl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 615</p>
<p>throughout the peninsula, built railways, factories and schools,
opened universities at Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Lahore and Allahabad,
brought the science and technology of England to India, inspired the
East with the democratic ideals of the West, and played an important
part in re- vealing to the world the cultural wealth of India’s past.
The price of these benefactions was a financial despotism by which a
race of transient rulers drained India’s wealth year by year as they
returned to the reinvigorating north; an economic despotism that ruined
India’s industries, and threw her millions of artisans back upon an
inadequate soil; and a political des- potism that, coming so soon after
the narrow tyranny of Aurangzeb, broke for a century the spirit of the
Indian people.</p>

<p>Christianity in India — The “Brahma - Somaj”— Mohammedanism —</p>
<p>Ramakrishna — V ivekananda</p>
<p>It was natural and characteristic that under these conditions
India</p>
<p>should seek consolation in religion. For a time she gave a cordial
welcome to Christianity; she found in it many ethical ideals that she
had honored for thousands of years; and “before the character and
behavior of Euro - peans,” says the blunt Abbe Dubois, “became well
known to these people, it seemed possible that Christianity might take
root among t hem .’” 0 Throughout the nineteenth century harassed
missionaries tried to make the voice of Christ audible above the roar of
the conquering cannon; they erected and equipped schools and hospitals,
dispensed medicine and char- ity as well as theology, and brought to the
Untouchables the first recog- nition of their humanity. But the contrast
between Christian precept and the practice of Christians left the Hindus
sceptical and satirical. They pointed out that the raising of Lazarus
from the dead was unworthy of remark; their own religion had many more
interesting and astonishing miracles than this; and any true Yogi could
perform miracles today, while those of Christianity were apparently
finished . 11 The Brahmans held their ground proudly, and offered
against the orthodoxies of the West a system of thought quite as subtle,
profound, and incredible. “The progress of Christianity in India,” says
Sir Charles Eliot, “has been insignificant .” 12</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fascinating figure of Christ has had far more
influence in India than may be measured by the fact that Christianity
has converted six per cent of the population in three hundred years. The
first signs of</p>
<p>dl6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>that influence appear in the Bhagavad-Gita; 1 * the latest are
evident in Gandhi and Tagore. The clearest instance is in the reform
organization known as the Brahma-Soma j* founded in 1828 by Ram Mohun
Roy. No one could have approached the study of religion more
conscientiously. Roy learned Sanskrit to read the Vedas, Pali to read
the Tripit aka of Buddhism, Persian and Arabic to study Mohammedanism
and the Koran, Hebrew to master the Old Testament and Greek to
understand the New. 14 Then he took up English, and wrote it with such
ease and grace that Jeremy Bentham wished that James Mill might profit
from the example. In 1820 Roy published his Precepts of Jesus: a Guide
to Peace and Happi- ness, and announced: “I have found the doctrines of
Christ more con - ducive to moral principles, and better adapted for the
use of rational beings, than any other which have come to my knowledge.”
15 He pro - posed to his scandalized countrymen a new religion, which
should</p>
<p>abandon polytheism, polygamy, caste, child marriage, suttee and
idolatry, and should worship one god — Brahman. Like Akbar he dreamed
that all India might be united in so simple a faith; and like Akbar he
underesti- mated the popularity of superstition. The Brahma-Soma j,
after a hun- dred years of useful struggle, is now an extinct force in
Indian life.f</p>
<p>The Moslems are the most powerful and interesting of the religious
minor- ities of India; but the study of their religion belongs to a
later volume. It is not astonishing that Mohammedanism, despite the
zealous aid of Aurangzeb, failed to win India to Islam; the miracle is
that Mohammedanism in India did not succumb to Hinduism. The survival of
this simple and masculine monotheism amid a jungle of polytheism attests
the virility of the Moslem mind; we need only recall the absorption of
Buddhism by Brahmanism to realize the vigor of this resistance, and the
measure of this achievement. Allah now has some 70,000,000 worshipers in
India.</p>
<p>The Hindu lias found little comfort in any alien faith; and the
figures that have most inspired his religious consciousness in the
nineteenth cen-</p>
<ul>
<li>Literally, the “Brahma Society”; known more fully as “The Society of
the Believers</li>
</ul>
<p>tit has today some 5,joo adherents. 18 Another reform organization,
the Arya-Somaj (Aryan Society), founded by Swami Dyananda, and
brilliantly carried forward by the late Lala Lajpat Rai, denounced
caste, polytheism, superstition, idolatry and Christianity, and urged a
return to the simpler religion of the Vedas. Its followers now number
half a million. 1 ’’ A reverse influence, of Hinduism upon Christianity,
appears in Theosophy — a mixture of Hindu mysticism and Christian
morality, developed in India by two exotic women: Mme. Helena Blavatsky
(1878) and Mrs. Annie Besant (1895).</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 617</p>
<p>tury were those that rooted their doctrine and practice in the
ancient creeds of the people. Ramalcrishna, a poor Brahman of Bengal,
became for a time a Christian, and felt the lure of Christ;* he became
at another time a Moslem, and joined in the austere ritual of Mohammedan
prayer; but soon his pious heart brought him back to Hinduism, even to
the ter- rible Kali whose priest he became, and whom he transformed into
a Mother-Goddess overflowing with tenderness and affection. He rejected
the ways of the intellect, and preached Bhakti-yoga — the discipline and
union of love. “The knowledge of God,” he said, “may be likened to a
man, while love of God is like a woman. Knowledge has entry only to the
outer rooms of God, and no one can enter into the inner mysteries of God
save a lover .” 18 Unlike Ram Mohun Roy, Ramakrishna took no trouble to
educate himself; he learned no Sanskrit and no English; he wrote
nothing, and shunned intellectual discourse. When a pompous logician
asked him, “What are knowledge, knower, and the object</p>
<p>known?” he answered, “Good man, I do not know all these niceties of
scholastic learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and that I am her
son.” 1 * All religions are good, he taught his followers; each is a way
to God, or a stage on the way, adapted to the mind and heart of the
seeker. To be converted from one religion to another is foolishness; one
need only continue on his own way, and reach to the essence of his own
faith. “All rivers flow to the ocean. Flow, and let others flow, too !”
20 He tolerated</p>
<p>Many fine souls, rich and poor, Brahman and Pariah, chose him as</p>
<p>Guru, and formed an order and mission in his name. The most vivid of
these followers was a proud young Kshatriya, Narendranath Dutt, who,
full of Spencer and Darwin, first presented himself to Ramakrishna as an
atheist unhappy in his atheism, but scornful of the myths and supersti-
tions with which he identified religion. Conquered by Ramakrishna’s
patient kind liness, “Naren” became the young Master’s most ardent dis -
ciple; he redefined God as “the totality of all souls ,” 21 and called
upon his fellow men to practise religion not through vain asceticism and
meditation, but through absolute devotion to men.</p>
<ul>
<li>To the end of his life he accepted the divinity of Christ, but
insisted that Buddha, Krishna and others were also incarnations of the
one God. He himself, he assured Vive- kananda, was a reincarnation of
Rama and Krishna . 178</li>
</ul>
<p>6 18</p>
<p>THE STORY OP CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Leave to the next life the reading of the Vedanta , and the
practice</p>
<p>of meditation. Let this body which is here be put at the service
of</p>
<p>others! . . .. The highest truth is this: God is present in all
beings.</p>
<p>They are His multiple forms. There is no other God to seek. He</p>
<p>alone serves God who serves all other beings! 2 *</p>
<p>Changing his name to Vivekananda, he left India to seek funds abroad
for the Ramakrishna Mission. In 1893 he found himself lost and penni-
less in Chicago. A day later he appeared in the Parliament of Religions
at the World’s Fair, addressed the meeting as a representative of Hindu
- ism, and captured everyone by his magnificent presence, his gospel of
the unity of all religions, and his simple ethics of human service as
the best worship of God; atheism became a noble religion under the
inspira- tion of his eloquence, and orthodox clergymen found themselves
honor- ing a “heathen” who said that there was no other God than the
souls of living things. Returning to India, he preached to his
countrymen a more virile creed than any Hindu had offered them since
Vedic days:</p>
<p>It is a man-making religion that we want. . . . Give up these</p>
<p>weakening mysticisms, and be strong. . . . For the next fifty
years</p>
<p>… let all other, vain gods disappear from our minds. This is the</p>
<p>only God that is awake, our own race, everywhere His hands, every-
where His feet, everywhere His ears; He covers everything. . . .</p>
<p>The first of all worship is the worship of those all around us. . .
.</p>
<p>These are all our gods — men and animals; and the first gods we have
to worship are our own countrymen. 2 *</p>
<p>It was but a step from this to Gandhi.</p>

<p>new school of painting has arisen in Bengal, which merges the
richness of color in the Ajanta frescoes with the delicacy of line in
the Rajput minia- tures. The paintings of Abanindranath Tagore share
modestly in the voluptuous mysticism and the delicate artistry that
brought the poetry of his uncle to international fame.</p>
<p>The Tagores are one of the great families of history.
Davendranath</p>
<p>Tagore (Bengali Thakur) was one of the organizers, and later the
head, of the Brahma-Soma j; a man of wealth, culture and sanctity, he
became in his old age a heretic patriarch of Bengal. From him have
descended the artists Abanindranath and Gogonendranath, the philosopher
Dwijen- dranath, and the poet Rabindranath, Tagore — the last two being
his sons. Rabindranath was brought up in an atmosphere of comfort and
refine- ment, in which music, poetry and high discourse were the very
air that he breathed. He was a gentle spirit from birth, a Shelley who
refused to die young or to grow old; so affectionate that squirrels
climbed, upon his knees, and birds perched upon his hands . 24 He was
observant and recep- tive, and felt the eddying overtones of experience
with a mystic sensitiv- ity. Sometimes he would stand for hours on a
balcony, noting wifh literary instinct the figure and features, the
mannerisms and gait of each passer-by in the street; sometimes, on a
sofa in an inner room, he would spend half a day silent with his
memories and his dreams. He began to compose verses on a slate, happy in
the thought that errors could be so easily wiped away.” Soon he was
writing songs ful l of tenderness for India — for the beauty of her
scenery, the loveliness of her women, and the sufferings of her people;
and he composed the music for these songs himself. All India sang them,
and the young poet thrilled to hear them on the lips of rough peasants
as he traveled, unknown, through distant villages.” Here is one of them,
translated from the Bengali by the author himself; who else has ever
expressed with such sympathetic scepticism the divine nonsense of
romantic love?</p>
<p>Tell me if this be all true, my lover, tell me if this be true.</p>
<p>When these eyes flash their lightning the dark clouds in your breast
make stormy answer.</p>
<p>Is it true that my lips are sweet like the opening bud of the
first</p>
<p>conscious love?</p>
<p>Do the memories of vanished months of May linger in my limbs?</p>
<p>Does the earth, like a harp, shiver into songs with the touch of
my</p>
<p>feet?</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Is it then true that the dewdrops fall from the eyes of night when
I</p>
<p>am seen, and the morning light is glad when it wraps my body</p>
<p>round?</p>
<p>Is it true, is it true, that your love traveled alone through ages
and</p>
<p>worlds in search of me?</p>
<p>That when you found me at last, your age-long desire found utter</p>
<p>peace in my gentle speech and my eyes and lips and flowing hair?</p>
<p>Is it then true that the mystery of the Infinite is written on
this</p>
<p>little forehead of mine?</p>
<p>Tell me, my lover, if all this be true?”</p>
<p>There are many virtues in these poems* — an intense and yet sober
patriotism; a femininely subtle understanding of love and woman, nature
and man; a passionate penetration into the insight of India’s
philosophers; and a Tennysonian delicacy of sentiment and phrase. If
there is any fault in them it is that they are too consistently
beautiful, too monotonously idealistic and tender. Every woman in them
is lovely, and every man in them is infatuated with woman, or death, or
God; nature, though some- times terrible, is always sublime, never
bleak, or barren, or hideous, f Perhaps the story of Ch itra is Tagore’s
story: her lover Arjuna tires of her in a year because she is completely
and uninterruptedly beautiful; only when she loses her beauty and,
becoming strong, takes up the natural labors of life, does the god love
her again — a profound symbol of the contented marriage . 28 Tagore
confesses his limitations with captivating grace:</p>
<p>My love, once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>Alas, I was not careful, and it struck your ringing anklets and
came</p>
<p>to grief.</p>
<p>It broke up into scraps of songs, and lay scattered at your
feet.®</p>
<p>Therefore he has sung lyrics to the end, and all the world except the
critics has heard him gladly. India was a little surprised when her
poet</p>
<p>♦ The more important volumes are Gitanjali (1913), Chitra (1914), The
Post-Office (1914), The Gardener (1914), Fruit-Gathering (1916), and Red
Oleanders (1925). The poet’s own My Reminiscences (1917) is a better
guide to understanding him than E. Thompson’s R. Tagore , Poet and
Dramatist (Oxford, 1926).</p>
<p>t Cf. his magnificent line: “When I go from hence let this be my
parting word, that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 62 1</p>
<p>received the Nobel prize (1913); the Bengal reviewers had seen only
his faults, and the Calcutta professors had used his poems as examples
of bad Bengali.” The young Nationalists disliked him because his
condemnation of the abuses in India’s moral life was stronger than his
cry for polit ical t freedom; and when he was knighted it seemed to them
a betrayal of India. He did not hold the honor long; for when, by a
tragic misunder- standing, British soldiers fired into a religious
gathering at Amritsar</p>
<p>(1919), Tagore returned his decorations to the Viceroy with a
stinging letter of renunciation. Today he is a solitary figure, perhaps
the most im- pressive of all men now on the earth: a reformer who has
had the cour- age to denounce the most basic of India’s institutions—
the caste system — and the dearest of her beliefs — transmigration; 81 a
Nationalist who longs for India’s liberty, but has dared to protest
against the chauvinism and self-seeking that play a part in the

<p>That a man unfamiliar with English till almost fifty should write</p>
<p>English so well is a sign of the ease with which some of the gaps can
be bridged between that East and that West whose mating another poet has
banned. For since the birth of Tagore the West has come to the East in a
hundred ways, and is changing every aspect of Oriental life. Thirty
thousand miles of railways have webbed the wastes and ghats of India,
and carried Western faces into every village; telegraph wires and the
printing press have brought to every student the news of a suggest-
ively changing world; English schools have taught British history with a
view to making British citizens, and have unwittingly inculcated English
ideas of democracy and liberty. Even the East now justifies
Heraclitus.</p>
<p>Reduced to poverty in the nineteenth century by the superior machin-
ery of British looms and the higher calibre of British guns, India
has</p>
<p>now turned her face reluctantly towards industrialization.
Handicrafts are dying, factories are growing. At Jamsetpur the Tata Iron
and Steel Company employs 45,000 men, and threatens the leadership of
American firms in the production of steel.“ The coal production of India
is mount- ing rapidly; within a generation China and India may overtake
Europe and America in lifting out of the soil the basic fuels and
materials of</p>
<p>industry. Not only will these native resources meet native needs,
they may compete with the West for the markets of the world, and the</p>
<p>conquerors of Asia may suddenly find their markets gone, and the</p>
<p>standards of living of their people at home severely reduced, by the
com- petition of low-wage labor in once docile and backward (i.e.,
agricul- tural) lands. In Bombay there are factories in mid- Victorian
style, with old-fashioned wages that bring tears of envy to the eyes of
Occidental Tories.* Hindu employers have replaced the British in many of
these industries, and exploit their fellow men with the rapacity of
Europeans bearing the white man’s burden.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1922 there were eighty-three cotton factories in Bombay, with
180,000 employees, and an average wage-scale of thirty-three cents a
day. Of 33,000,000 Indians engaged in industry, 51per are women, 14per
are children under fourteen. 85</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 623</p>
<p>The economic basis of Indian society has not changed without
affecting the social institutions and moral customs of the people. The
caste system was conceived in terms of a static and agricultural
society; it provided order, but gave no opening to unpedigreed genius,
no purchase to ambi- tion and hope, no stimulus to invention and
enterprise; it was doomed when the Industrial Revolution reached India’s
shores. The machine does not respect persons: in most of the factories
men work side by side with- out discrimination of caste, trains and
trams give berth or standing-room to all who can pay, cooperative
societies and political parties bring all grades together, and in the
congestion of the urban theatre or street Brahman and Pariah rub elbows
in unexpected fellowship. A raja an- nounces that every caste and creed
will find reception at his court; a Shudra becomes the enlightened ruler
of Baroda; the Brahma-Soma j denounces caste, and the Bengal Provincial
Congress of the National Congress advocates the abo lition of all caste
distinctions forthwith. “ Slowly the machine lifts a new class to wealth
and power, and brings the most ancient of living aristocracies to an
end.</p>
<p>Already the caste terms are losing significance. The word Vaisya
is</p>
<p>used in books today, but has no application in actual life. Even the
term Shudra has disappeared from the north, while in the south it is a
loose designation for all non-Brahmans.“ The lower castes of older days
have in effect been replaced by over three thousand “castes” that are
really guilds: bankers, merchants, manufacturers, farmers, professors,
engineers, trackwalkers, college women, butchers, barbers, fishermen,
actors, coal miners, washermen, cabmen, shop-girls, bootblacks — these
are organized into occupational castes that differ from our trade-unions
chiefly in the loose expectation that sons will follow the trades of
their fathers.</p>
<p>The great tragedy of the caste system is that it has multiplied,
from</p>
<p>generation to generation, those Untouchables whose growing number and
rebelliousness undermine the institution that created them. The
Outcastes have received into their ranks all those who were enslaved by
war or debt, all the children of marriages between Brahmans and Shudras,
and all those unfortunates whose work, as scavengers, butchers,
acrobats, conjurors or executioners was stamped as degrading by
Brahmanical law;“ and they have swollen their mass by the improvident
fertility of those who have nothing to lose. Their bitter poverty has
made cleanliness of body, cloth- ing or food an impossible luxury for
them; and their fellows shun them</p>
<p>624 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>with every sense.* Therefore the laws of caste forbid an Untouchable
to approach nearer than twenty-four feet to a Shudra, or seventy-four
feet to a Brahman; 40 if the shadow of a Pariah falls upon a man of
caste, the latter must remove the contamination by a purifying ablution.
Whatever the Outcaste touches is thereby defiled, f In many parts of
India he must not draw water from the public wells, or enter temples
used by Brahmans, or send his children to the Hindu schools. 42 The
British, whose policies have in some degree contributed to the
impoverishment of the Outcastes, have brought them at least equality
before the law, and equal access to all British-controlled colleges and
schools. The Nationalist movement, under the inspiration of Gandhi, has
done much to lessen the disabilities of the Untouchables. Perhaps
another generation will see them externally and superficially free.</p>
<p>The coming of industry, and of Western ideas, is disturbing the
ancient mastery of the Hindu male. Industrialization defers the age of
marriage, and requires the “emancipation” of woman; that is to say, the
woman can - not be lured into the factory unless she is persuaded that
home is a prison, and is entitled by law to keep her earnings for
herself. Many real reforms have come as incidents to this emancipation.
Child marriage has been formally ended (1929) by raising the legal age
of marriage to fourteen for girls and to eighteen for men; 48 suttee has
disappeared, and the remarriage of widows grows daily; J polygamy is
allowed, but few men practise</p>
<p>it; 45 and tourists are disappointed to find that the temple dancers
are alm ost extinct. In no other country is moral reform progressing
so</p>
<p>rapidly. Industrial city life is drawing women out of purdah ; hardly
six per cent of the women of India accept such seclusion today. 40 A
number of lively periodicals for women discuss the most up-to-date
questions; even a birth-control league has appeared, 47 and has faced
bravely the gravest problem of India — indiscriminate fertility. In many
of the prov- inces women vote and hold political office; twice women

<p>fin 1913 the child of a rich Hindu of Kohat fell into a fountain and
was drowned. No one was at hand but its mother and a passing Outcaste.
The latter offered to plunge into the water and rescue the child, but
the mother refused; she preferred the death of her child to the
defilement of the fountain. 41</p>

<p>dent of the Indian National Congress. Many of them have taken degrees
at the universities, and have become doctors, lawyers, or professors. 48
Soon, no doubt, the tables will be turned, and women will rule. Must not
some wild Western influence bear the guilt of this flaming appeal issued
by a subaltern of Gandhi to the women of India? —</p>
<p>Away with ancient purdah! Come out of the kitchens quick!</p>
<p>Fling the pots and pans rattling into the corners! Tear the clqth</p>
<p>from your eyes, and see the new world! Let your husbands and</p>
<p>brothers cook for themselves. There is much work to be done to</p>

<p>V. THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT</p>
<p>The westernized students — The secularization of heaven — The</p>
<p>Indian National Congress</p>
<p>In 1923 there were over a thousand Hindus studying in England, pre-
sumably an equal number in America, perhaps an equal number elsewhere.
They marveled at the privileges enjoyed by the lowliest citizens of
western Europe and America; they studied the French and American
Revolutions, and read the literature of reform and revolt; they gloated
over the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the
Declaration of Inde- pendence, and the American Constitution; they went
back to their coun- tries as centers of infection for democratic ideas
and the gospel of liberty. The industrial and scientific advances of the
West, and the victory of the Allies in the War, gave to these ideas an
irresistible prestige; soon every student was shouting the battle-cry of
freedom. In the schools of England and America the Hindus learned to be
free.</p>
<p>These Western-educated Orientals had not only taken on political</p>
<p>ideals in the course of their education abroad, they had shed
religious ideas; the two processes are usually associated, in biography
and in history. They came to Europe as pious youths, wedded to Krishna,
Shiva, Vishnu, Kali, Rama . . . ; they touched science, and their
ancient faiths were</p>
<p>shattered as by some sudden catalytic shock. Shorn of religious
belief, which is the very spirit of India, the Westernized Hindus
returned to their country disillusioned and sad; a thousand gods had
dropped dead from the skies* Then, inevitably, Utopia filled the place
of Heaven, democracy</p>
<ul>
<li>This does not apply to all. Some, in the significant phrase of
Coomaraswamy, have “returned from Europe to India.”</li>

<p>626 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>became a substitute for Nirvana , liberty replaced God. What had gone
on in Europe in the second half of the eighteenth century now went on in
the East.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the new ideas developed slowly. In 1885 a few Hindu</p>
<p>leaders met at Bombay and founded the “Indian National Congress,” but
they do not seem to have dreamed then even of Home Rule. The effort of
Lord Curzon to partition Bengal (that is, to destroy the unity and</p>
<p>strength of the most powerful and politically conscious community in
India) roused the Nationalists to a more rebel mood; and at the Congress
of 1905 the uncompromising Tilak demanded Swaraj. He had created the
word” out of Sanskrit roots still visible in its E nglish translation —
“self - rule.” In that same eventful year Japan defeated Russia; and the
East, which for a century had been fearful of the West, began to lay
plans for the liberation of Asia. China followed Sun Yat Sen, took up
the sword, and fell into the arms of Japan. India, weaponless, accepted
as her leader one of the strangest figures in history, and gave to the
world the unprece- dented phenomenon of a revolution led by a saint, and
waged without a gun.</p>

<p>Picture the ugliest, slightest, weakest man in Asia, with face and
flesh of bronze, close-cropped gray head, high cheek-bones, kindly
little brown eyes, a large and almost toothless mouth, larger ears, an
enormous nose, thin arms and legs, clad in a loin cloth, standing before
an English judge in I ndia, on trial for preaching “non - cooperation”
to his countrymen. Or picture him seated on a small carpet in a bare
room at his Satyagrahashram, — School of Truth-Seekers — at Ahmedabad:
his bony legs crossed under him in yogi fashion, soles upward, his hands
busy at a spinning-wheel, his face lined with responsibility, his mind
active with ready answers to every questioner of freedom. From 1920 to
1935 this naked weaver was both the spiritual and the political leader
of 3 20,000,000 Indians. When he ap- peared in public, crowds gathered
round him to touch his clothing or to kiss his feet. 61</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 627</p>
<p>Four hours a day he spun the coarse khaddar, hoping by his example to
persuade his countrymen to use this simple homespun instead of buying
the product of those British looms that had ruined the textile industry
of India. His only possessions were three rough cloths — two as his
ward- robe and one as his bed. Once a rich lawyer, he had given all his
prop- erty to the poor, and his wife, after some matronly hesitation,
had fol- lowed his example. He slept on the bare floor, or on the earth.
He lived on nuts, plantains, lemons, oranges, dates, rice, and goat’s
milk ; 52 often for months together he took nothing but milk and fruit;
once in his life he tasted meat; occasionally he ate nothing for weeks.
“I can as well do with - out my eyes as without fasts. What the eyes are
for the outer world, fasts are for the inner .” 53 As the blood thins,
he felt, the mind clears, irrelevan- cies fall away, and fundamental
things — sometimes the very Soul of the World — rise out of Maya like
Everest through the clouds.</p>
<p>At the same time that he fasted to see divinity he kept one toe on
the earth, and advised his followers to take an enema daily when
they</p>
<p>fasted, lest they be poisoned with the acid products of the body’s
self - consumption just as they might be finding God . 54 When the
Moslems and the Hindus killed one another in theological enthusiasm, and
paid no heed to his pleas for peace, he went without food for three
weeks to move them. He became so weak and frail through fasts and
privations that when he addressed the great audiences that gathered to
hear him, he spoke to them from an uplifted chair. He carried his
asceticism into the field of sex, and wished, like Tolstoi, to limit all
physical intercourse to delib- erate reproduction. He too, in his youth,
had indulged the flesh too</p>
<p>much, and the news of his father’s death had surprised him in the
arms of love. Now he returned with passionate remorse to the
Brahmacharia that had been preached to him in his boyhood — absolute
abstention from all sensual desire. He persuaded his wife to live with
him only as sister with brother; and “from that time,” he tells us, “all
dissension ceased.”“ When he realized that India’s basic need was birth
-control, he adopted not the methods of the West, but the theories of
Malthus and Tolstoi.</p>
<p>Is it right for us, who know the situation, to bring forth
children?</p>
<p>We only multiply slaves and weaklings if we continue the process</p>
<p>of procreation whilst we feel and remain helpless. . . . Not till
India</p>
<p>has become a free nation . . . have we the right to bring forth</p>
<p>progeny. … I have not a shadow of doubt that married people, if</p>
<p>628</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>they wish well to the country and want to see India become a nation
of strong and handsome, well-formed men and women, would prac- tice
self-restraint and cease to procreate for the time being.“</p>
<p>Added to these elements in his character were qualities strangely
like those that, we are told, distinguished the Founder of Christianity.
He did not mouth the name of Christ, but he acted as if he accepted
every word of the Sermon on the Mount. Not since St. Francis of Assisi
has any life known to history been so marked by gentleness,
disinterestedness, sim- plicity, and forgiveness of enemies. It was to
the credit of his opponents, but still more to his own, that his
undiscourageable courtesy to them won a fine courtesy from them in
return; the Government sent him to jail with profuse apologies. He never
showed rancor or resentment. Thrice he was attacked by mobs, and beaten
almost to death; not once did he retaliate; and when one of his
assailants was arrested he refused to enter a charge. Shortly after the
worst of all riots between Moslems and Hindus, when the Moplah
Mohammedans butchered hundreds of unarmed Hindus and offered their
prepuces as a covenant to Allah, these same Moslems were stricken with
famine; Gandhi collected funds for them from all India, and, with no
regard for the best precedents, forwarded every anna, without deduction
for “overhead,” to the starving enemy.“</p>
<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was bom in 1869. His family be-</p>
<p>longed to the Vaisya caste, and to the Jain sect, and practised the
ahimsa principle of never injuring a living thing. His father was a
capable admin- istrator but an heretical financier; he lost place after
place through hon- esty, gave nearly all his wealth to charity, and left
the rest to his family. 68 While still a boy Mohandas became an atheist,
being displeased with the adulterous gallantries of certain Hindu gods;
and to make clear his ever- lasting scorn for religion, he ate meat. The
meat disagreed with him, and he returned to religion.</p>
<p>At eight he was engaged, and at twelve he was married, to Kasturbai,
who remained loyal to him through all his adventures, riches, poverty,
imprisonments, and Brahmacharia. At eighteen he passed examinations for
the university, and went to London to study law. In his first year there
he read eighty books on Christianity. The Sermon on the Mount “went</p>
<p>str ai ght to my heart on the first reading.” 66 He took the counsel
to return</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 629</p>
<p>Returning to India in 1891, he practised law for a time in Bombay,
re- fusing to prosecute for debt, and always reserving the right to
abandon a case which he had come to think unjust. One case led him to
South Africa; there he found his fellow-Hindus so maltreated that he
forgot to return to India, but gave himself completely, without
remuneration, to the cause of removing the disabilities of his
countrymen in Africa. For twenty years he fought this issue out until
the Government yielded. Only then did he return home.</p>
<p>Traveling through India he realized for the first time the
complete</p>
<p>destitution of his people. He was horrified by the skeletons whom he
saw toiling in the fields, and the lowly Outcastes who did the menial
work of the towns. It seemed to him that the discriminations against his
coun- trymen abroad were merely one consequence of their poverty and
sub- jection at home. Nevertheless he supported England loyally in the
War; he even advocated the enlistment of Hindus who did not accept the
prin- ciple of non-violence. He did not, at that time, agree with those
who called for independence; he believed that British misgovernment in
India was an exception, and that British government in general was good;
that British government in India was bad just because it violated all
the prin- ciples of British government at home; and that if the English
people could be made to understand the case of the Hindus, it would soon
accept them in full brotherhood into a commonwealth of free dominions.
60 He trusted that when the War was over, and Britain counted In dia’s
sacrifice for the Empire in men and wealth, it would no longer hesitate
to give her liberty.</p>
<p>But at the close of the War the agitation for Home Rule was met
by</p>
<p>the Rowland Acts, which put an end to freedom of speech and press; by
the establishment of the impotent legislature of the Montagu-Chelms-
ford reforms; and finally by the slaughter at Amritsar. Gandhi was</p>
<p>shocked into decisive action. He returned to the Viceroy the
decorations which he had received at various times from British
governments; and he issued to India a call for active civil disobedience
against the Government of India. The people responded not with peaceful
resistance, as he had asked, but with bloodshed and violence; in Bombay,
for example, they killed fifty-three unsympathetic Parsees. 61 Gandhi,
vowed to ahimsa, sent out a second message, in which he called upon the
people to postpone the campaign of civil disobedience, on the ground
that it was degenerating into mob rule. Seldom in history had a man
shown more courage in</p>
<p>acting on principle, scorning expediency and popularity. The nation
was</p>
<p>630 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>astonished at his decision; it had supposed itself near to success,
and it did not agree with Gandhi that the means might be as important as
the end. The reputation of the Mahatma sank to the lowest ebb.</p>
<p>It was just at this point (in March, 1922) that the Government deter-
mined upon his arrest. He made no resistance, declined to engage a
lawyer, and offered no defense. When the Prosecutor charged him with
being responsible, through his publications, for the violence that had
marked the outbreak of 1921, Gandhi replied in terms that lifted him at
once to nobility.</p>
<p>I wish to endorse all the blame that the learned Advocate-General</p>
<p>has thrown on my shoulder in connection with the incidents in Bom-
bay, Madras, and Chauri Chaura. Thinking over these deeply, and</p>
<p>sleeping over them night after night, it is impossible for me to</p>
<p>dissociate myself from these diabolical crimes. . . . The learned</p>
<p>Advocate-General is quite right when he says that as a man of</p>
<p>responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, . .
.</p>
<p>I should have known the consequences of every one of my acts. I</p>
<p>knew that I was playing with fire, I ran the risk, and if I was
set</p>
<p>free I would still do the same. I felt this morning that I would
have</p>
<p>failed in my duty if I did not say what I say here just now.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid violence. I want to avoid violence. Non-</p>
<p>violence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last
article of</p>
<p>my creed. But I had to make my choice. I had either to submit to</p>
<p>a system which I considered had done an irreparable harm to my</p>
<p>country, or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting</p>
<p>forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I know that</p>
<p>my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply sorry for it,</p>
<p>and I am therefore here to submit not to a light penalty but to
the</p>
<p>highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any ex-</p>
<p>tenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and cheerfully
submit</p>
<p>to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law
is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a
citizen. 63</p>
<p>The Judge expressed his profound regret that he had to send to
jail</p>
<p>one whom millions of his countrymen considered “a great patriot and a
great leader”; he admitted that even those who differed from Gandhi
looked upon him “as a man of high ideals and of noble and even saintly
life.” 08 He sentenced him to prison for six years.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) A CHRISTIAN EPILOGUE 63 1</p>
<p>Gandhi was put under solitary confinement, but he did not complain.
“I do not see any of the other prisoners,” he wrote, “though I really do
not see how my society coul d do them any harm.” But “I feel happy. My
nature likes loneliness. I love quietness. And now I have opportunity to
engage in studies that I had to neglect in the outside world.”“ He in -
structed himself sedulously in the writings of Bacon, Carlyle, Ruskin,
Emerson, Thoreau and Tolstoi, and solaced long hours with Ben Jonson and
Walter Scott. He Tead and re-read the Bhagavad-Gita. He studied
Sanskrit, Tamil and Urdu so that he might be able not only to write for
scholars but to speak to the multitude. He drew up a detailed schedule
of studies for the six years of his imprisonment, and pursued it
faithfully till accident intervened. “I used to sit down to my books
with the delight of a young man of twenty-four, and forgetting my
four-and-fifty years and my poor health .” 85</p>
<p>Appendicitis secured his release, and Occidental medicine, which he
had often denounced, secured his recovery. A vast crowd gathered at the
prison gates to greet him on his exit, and many kissed his coarse gar-
ment as he passed. But he shunned politics and the public eye, pled his
weakness and illness, and retired to his school at Ahmedabad, where he
lived for many years in quiet isolation with his students. From that re-
treat, however, he sent forth weekly, through his mouthpiece Young India
, editorials expounding his philosophy of revolution and life. He begged
his followers to shun violence, not only because it would be suicidal,
since India had no guns, but because it would only replace one despotism
with another . “History,” he told them, “teaches one that those who
have, no doubt with honest motives, ousted the greedy by using brute
force against them, have in their turn become a prey to the disease of
the conquered. . . . My interest in India’s freedom will c ease if she
adopts violent means. For their fruit will be not freedom, but
slavery.”“</p>
<p>The second element in his creed was the resolute rejection of modem
industry, and a Rousseauian call for a return to the simple life of
agri- culture and domestic industry in the village. The confinement of
men and women in factories, making with machines owned by others
fractions of articles whose finished form they will never see, seemed to
Gandhi a roundabout way of burying humanity under a pyramid of
shoddy</p>
<p>goods. Most machine products, he thought, are unnecessary; the labor
saved in using them is consumed in making and repairing them; or if</p>
<p>632 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>labor is really saved it is of no benefit to labor, but only to
capital; labor is thrown by its own productivity into a panic of
“technological unem - ployment.” 81 So he renewed the Swadeshi movement
announced in 1905 by Tilak; self-production was to be added to Swaraj,
self-rule. Gandhi made the use of the charka, or spinning-wheel, a test
of loyal adherence to the Nationalist movement; he asked that every
Hindu, even the richest, should wear homespun, and boycott the alien and
mechanical textiles of Britain, so that the homes of India might hum
once more, through the dull winter, with the sound of the
spinning-wheel. 88</p>
<p>The response was not universal; it is difficult to stop history in
its</p>
<p>course. But India tried. Hindu students everywhere dressed in
kloaddar; highborn ladies abandoned their Japanese silk saris for coarse
cloths woven by themselves; prostitutes in brothels and convicts in
prison began to spin; and in many cities great Feasts of the Vanities
were arranged, as in Savonarola’s day, at which wealthy Hindus and
merchants brought from their homes and warehouses all their imported
cloth, and flung it into the fire. In one day at Bombay. alone, 1 50,000
pieces were consumed by the flames. 88</p>
<p>The movement away from industry failed, but it gave India for a
decade a symbol of revolt, and helped to polarize her mute millions into
a new unity of political consciousness. India doubted the means, but
honored the purpose; and though it questioned Gandhi the statesman, it
took to its heart Gandhi the saint, and for a moment became one in
reverencing him. It was as Tagore said of him:</p>
<p>He stopped at the thresholds of the huts of the thousands of dis-</p>
<p>possessed, dressed like one of their own. He spoke to them in
their</p>
<p>own language. Here was living truth at last, and not only quotations
from books. For this reason the Mahatma, the name given to him</p>
<p>by the people of India, is his real name. Who else has felt like
him</p>

<li>FAREWELL TO INDIA</li>
</ol>
<p>One cannot conclude the history of India as one can conclude the</p>
<p>history of Egypt, or Babylonia, or Assyria; for that history is still
being made, that civilization is still creating. Culturally India has
been reinvig- orated by mental contact with the West, and her literature
today is as fertile and noble as any. Spiritually she is still
struggling with superstition and excess theological baggage, but there
is no telling how quickly the acids of modern science will dissolve
these supernumerary gods. Politically the last one hundred years have
brought to India such unity as she has seldom had before: partly the
unity of one alien government, partly the unity of one alien speech, but
above all the unity of one welding aspiration to liberty. Economically
India is passing, for better and for worse, out of medievalism into
modem industry; her wealth and her trade will grow, and before the end
of the century she will doubtless be among the powers of the earth.</p>
<p>We cannot claim for this civilization such direct gifts to our own
as</p>
<p>we have traced to Egypt and the Near East; for these last were the
im- mediate ancestors of our own culture, while the history of India,
China and Japan flowed in another stream, and is only now beginning to
touch and influence the current of Occidental life. It is true that even
across the Himalayan barrier India has sent to us such questionable
gifts as grammar and logic, philosophy and fables, hypnotism and chess,
and above all, our numerals and our decimal system. But these are not
the essence of her spirit; they are trifles compared to what we may leam
from her in the future. As invention, industry and trade bind the
continents together, or as they fling us into conflict with Asia, we
shall study its civilizations more closely, and shall absorb, even in
enmity, some of its ways and thoughts. Perhaps, in return for conquest,
arrogance and spoliation, India will teach us the tolerance and
gentleness of the mature mind, the quiet content of the unacquisitive
soul, the calm of the understanding spirit, and a unifying, pacifying
love for all living things.</p>
