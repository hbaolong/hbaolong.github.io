<h4 id="chapter-xii">CHAPTER XII</h4>
<p>Work and Wealth in Athens</p>
<p>I. LAND AND FOOD</p>
<p>AT the base of this democracy and this culture lies the production
and XJL distribution of wealth. Some men can govern states, seek truth,
make music, carve statues, paint pictures, write books, teach children,
or serve the gods because others toil to grow food, weave clothing,
build dwellings, mine the earth, make useful things, transport goods,
exchange them, or finance their production or their movement. Everywhere
this is the foun- dation.</p>
<p>Supporting all society is the peasant, the poorest and most necessary
of men. In Attica he has at least the franchise; only citizens are
permitted to own land, and nearly all peasants own the soil that they
till. Clan control of the land has disappeared, and private ownership is
solidly established. As in modem France and America, this great class of
small proprietors is a steadying conservative force in a democracy where
the propertyless city dwellers are always driving toward reform. The
ancient war between the country and the city — between those who want
high returns for agricul- ture and low prices for manufactured goods,
and those who want low prices for food and high wages or profits in
industry — is especially con- scious and lively in Attica. Whereas
industry and trade are accounted plebeian and degrading by the Athenian
citizen, the pursuits of husbandry are honored as the groundwork of
national economy, personal character, and military power; and the
freemen of the countryside tend to look down upon the denizens of the
city as either weakling parasites or degraded slaves.’</p>
<p>The soil is poor: of 630,000 acres in Attica a third is unsuitable
for cul- tivation, and the rest is impoverished by deforestation, meager
rainfall, and rapid erosion by winter floods. The peasants of Attica
shirk no toil — for themselves or their handful of slaves — to remedy
this dry humor of the gods; they gather the surplus flow of headwaters
into reservoirs, dike the channels of the streams to control the floods,
reclaim the precious humus of the swamps, build thousands of irrigation
canals to bring to their thirsty fields the trickle of the rivulets,
patiently transplant vegetables to improve</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 269</p>
<p>their size and quality, and let the land lie fallow in alternate
years to regain its strength. They alkalinize the soil Avith salts like
carbonate of lime, and fertilize it with potassium nitrate, ashes, and
human waste;’ the gardens and groves about Athens are enriched with the
sewage of the city, brought by a main sewer to a reservoir outside the
Dipylon, and led thence by brick- lined canals into the valley of the
Cephisus River.’ Different soils are mixed to their mutual benefit, and
green crops like beans in flower are plowed in to nourish the earth.
Plowing, harrowing, sowing, and planting are crowded into the brief days
of the fall; the grain harvest comes at the end of May, and the rainless
summer is the season of preparation and rest. With all this care Attica
produces only 675,000 bushels of grain yearly — hardly enough to supply
a quarter of its population. Without imported food Periclean Athens
would starve; hence the urge to imperialism, and the necessity for a
powerful fleet.</p>
<p>The countryside tries to atone for its parsimonious grain by generous
harvests of olives and grapes. Hillsides are terraced and watered, and
asses are encouraged to make the vine more fruitful by gnawing off the
twigs.’ Olive trees cover many a landscape in Periclean Greece, but it
is Peisistratus and Solon who deserve the credit for introducing them.
The olive tree takes sixteen years to come to fruit, forty years to
reach perfection; with- out the subsidies of Peisistratus it might never
have grown on Attic soil; and the devastation of the olive orchards in
the Peloponnesian War will play a part in the decline of Athens. To the
Greek the olive has many uses: one pressing gives oil for eating, a
second, oil for anointing, a third, oil for illumination; and the
remainder is used as fuel.’ It becomes Attica’s richest crop, so
valuable that the state assumes a monopoly of its export, and pays with
it and wine for the grain that it must import.</p>
<p>It forbids altogether the export of figs, for these are a main source
of health and energy in Greece. The fig tree grows well even in arid
soil; its spreading roots gather whatever moisture the earth will yield,
and its stinted foliage offers scant surface for evaporation.
Furthermore, the hus- bandman learns from the East the secret of
caprification: he hangs branches of the wild male goat fig (capri ficus)
among the boughs of the female cul- tivated tree, and relies upon gall
wasps to carry the fertilizing pollen of the male into the fruit of the
female, which then bears richer and sweeter figs.</p>
<p>These products of the soil — cereals, olive oil, figs, grapes, and
wine — are the staples of diet in Attica. Cattle rearing is negligible
as a source of food; horses are bred for racing, sheep for wool, goats
for milk, asses, mules, cows, and oxen for transport, but chiefly pigs
for food; and bees are kept as pro-</p>

<p>viders of honey for a sugarless world. Meat is a luxury; the poor
have it only on feast days; the heroic banquets of Homeric days have
disappeared. Fish is both a commonplace and a delicacy; the poor man
buys it salted and dried; the rich man celebrates with fresh shark meat
and eels.“ Cereals take the form of porridge, flat loaves, or cakes,
often mixed with honey. Bread and cake are seldom baked at home, but are
bought from women peddlers or in market stalls. Eggs are added, and
vegetables — particularly beans, peas, cabbage, lentils, lettuce,
onions, and garlic. Fruits are few; oranges and lemons are unknown. Nuts
are common, and condiments abound. Salt is collected in salt pans from
the sea, and is traded in the in- terior for slaves; a cheap slave is
called a “salting,” and a good one is “worth</p>

<li>INDUSTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>Out of the earth come minerals and fuels as well as food. Lighting is
provided by graceful lamps or torches — burning refined olive oil, or
resin — or by candles. Heat is derived from dry wood or charcoal,
burning in portable braziers. The cutting of trees for fuel and building
denudes the woods and hills near the towns; already in the fifth century
timber for houses, furniture, and ships is imported. There is no
coal.</p>
<p>Greek mining is not for fuels but for minerals. The soil of Attica is
rich in marble, iron, zinc, silver, and lead. The mines at Laurium, near
the southern tip of the peninsula, are in the phrase of Aeschylus “a
fountain running silver”” for Athens; they are a main support of the
government, which retains all sub- soil rights, and leases the mines to
private operators for a talent (|6ooo) fee and one twenty- fourth of the
product yearly.” In 483 a prospector discovers the first really
profitable veins at Laurium, and a silver rush takes place to the region
of the mines. Only citizens are allowed to lease the properties, and
only slaves perform the work. The pious Nicias, whose superstition will
help to</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS IJl</p>
<p>ruin Athens, makes 70 a day by leasing a thousand slaves to the mine
oper- ators at a rental of one obol (17 cents) each per day; many an
Athenian fortune is made in this way, or by lending money to the
enterprise. The slaves in the mine number some twenty thousand, and
include the superintendents and engineers. They work in ten-hour shifts,
and the operations continue without interruption, night and day. If the
slave rests he feels the foreman’s</p>

Salamis. Even</li>
</ol>
<p>Metallurgy advances with mining. The ore at Laurium is crushed in
huge mortars with a heavy iron pestle worked by slave power; then it
goes to mills where it is ground between revolving stones of hard
trachyte; then it is sized by screening; the material that passes
through the screen is sent to an ore washer, where jets of water are
discharged from cisterns upon inclined rec- tangular tables of stone
covered with a smooth thin coat of hard cement; the current is turned at
sharp angles, where pockets snare the metal particles. The collected
metal is thrown into small smelting furnaces equipped with blowers to
raise the heat; at the bottom of each furnace are openings through which
the molten metal is drawn. Lead is separated from the silver by heating
the molten metal on cupels of porous material and exposing it to the
air; by this simple process the lead is converted into litharge, and the
silver is freed. The processes of smelting and refining are competently
performed, for the silver coins of Athens are ninety-eight per cent
pure. Laurium pays the price of the wealth it produces, as mining always
pays the price for metal industry; plants and men wither and die from
the furnace fumes, and the vicinity of the works becomes a scene of
dusty desolation.^</p>
<p>Other industries are not so toilsome. Attica has many of them now,
small in scale but remarkably specialized. It quarries marble and other
stones, it makes a thousand shapes of pottery, it dresses hides in great
tanneries like those owned by Cleon, rival of Pericles, and Anytus,
accuser of Socrates; it has wagon- makers, shipbuilders, saddlers,
harness makers, shoe manufacturers; there are saddlers who make only
bridles, and shoemakers who make only men’s or</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>(chap, xn</p>
<p>women’s shoes.“ In the building trades are carpenters, molders,
stonecutters, metalworkers, painters, veneerers. There are blacksmiths,
swordmakers, shield- makers, lampmakers, lyre tuners, millers, bakers,
sausage men, fishmongers — everything necessary to an economic life busy
and varied, but not mechanized or monotonous. Common textiles are still
for the most part produced in the home; there the women weave and mend
the ordinary clothing and bedding of the family, some carding the wool,
some at the spinning wheel, some at the loom, some bent over an
embroidery frame. Special fabrics come from work- shops, or from abroad
— fine linens from Egypt, Amorgos, and Tarentum, dyed woolens from
Syracuse, blankets from Corinth, carpets from the Near East and
Carthage, colorful coverlets from Cyprus; and the women of Cos, late in
the fourth century, learn the art of unwinding the cocoons of the
silkworm and weaving the filaments into silk.“ In some homes the women
become so highly skilled in textile arts that they produce more than
their families can use; they sell the surplus at first to consumers,
then to middlemen; they employ helpers, freedmen or slaves; and in this
way a domestic industry develops as a step to a factory system.</p>
<p>Such a system begins to take form in the age of Pericles. Pericles
himself, like Alcibiades, owns a factory.” No machinery is available,
but slaves can be had in abimdance; it is because muscle power is cheap
that there is no incentive to develop machinery. The ergasteria of
Athens are rather workshops than factories; the largest of them,
Cephalus’ shield factory, has 120 workmen, Timarchus’ shoe factory has
ten, Demosthenes’ cabinet factory twenty, his armor factory thirty.^ At
first these shops produce only to order; later they manufacture for the
market, and finally for export; and the spread and abun- dance of
coinage, replacing barter, facilitates their operations. There are no
corporations; each factory is an independent unit, owned by one or two
men; and the owner often works beside his slaves. There are no patents;
crafts are handed down from father to son, or are learned by
apprentices; the Athenians are exempted by law from caring for the old
age of parents who have failed to teach them a trade .“ Hours are long
but work is leisurely; master and man labor from dawn to twilight, with
a siesta at summer noons. There are no vacations, but there are some
sixty workless holydays every year. III. TRADE AND FINANCE</p>
<p>When an individual, a family, or a city creates a surplus, and wishes
to exchange it, trade begins. The first difficulty here is that
transport is costly, for roads are poor, and the sea is a snare. The
finest road is the Sacred Way from Athens to Eleusis; but this is mere
dirt, and is often too narrow to let vehicles pass. The bridges are
precarious causeways formed by earthen</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 273</p>
<p>dikes, which as likely as not have been washed away by floods. The
usual draft animal is the ox, who is too philosophical to enrich the
trader that de- pends upon him for transport; wagons are fragile, and
always break down, or get bogged in the mud; it is better to pack the
goods on the back of a mule, for he goes a trifle faster, and does not
take up so much of the road. There is no postal service in Greece, even
for the governments; they are con- tent with runners, and private
correspondence must wait the chance of using these. Important news can
be flashed by fire beacons from hill to hill, or sent by carrier
pigeons.* There are inns here and there on the road, but they are
favored by robbers and vermin; even the god Dionysus, in Aris- tophanes,
inquires of Heracles for “the eating -houses and hostels where there are
the fewest bugs.”*</p>
<p>Sea transport is cheaper, especially if voyages are limited, as most
of them are, to the calm summer months. Passenger tariffs are low: for
two drach- mas () a family can secure passage from the Piraeus to Egypt
or the Black Sea,* but ships do not cater to passengers, being made to
carry goods or wage war or do either at need. The main motive power is
wind upon a sail, but slaves ply the oars when the wind is contrary or
dead. The small- est seagoing merchant vessels are triaconters with
thirty oars, all on one level; the penteconter has fifty. Back about 700
the Corinthians launched the first trireme, with a crew of two hundred
men plying three banks or tiers of oars; by the fifth century such
ships, beautiful with their long and lofty prows, have grown to 256
tons, carry seven thousand bushels of grain, and become the talk of the
Mediterranean by making eight miles an hour.*</p>
<p>The second problem of trade is to find a reliable medium of exchange.
Every city has its own system of weights and measures, and its own indi-
vidual coinage; at every one of a hundred frontiers one must transvalue
all values skeptically, for every Greek government except the Athenian
cheats by debasing its coins.* “In most cities,” says an anonymous
Greek, “merchants are compelled t o ship goods for the return journey,
for they cannot get money that is of any use to them elsewhere.”* Some
cities mint coins of electrum — a compound of silver and gold — and
rival one another in getting as little gold as possible into the
mixture. The Athenian govern- ment, from Solon onward, helps Athenian
trade powerfully by establishing a reliable coinage, stamped with the
owl of Athena; “taking owls to Athens” is the Greek equivalent of
“carrying coals to Newcastle.”* Because Athens, through all her
vicissitudes, refuses to depreciate her silver drachmas, these “owls”
are accepted gladly throughout the Mediterranean world, and tend</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>(chap, xn</p>
<p>to displace local currencies in the Aegean. Gold at this stage is
still an article of merchandise, sold by weight, rather than a vehicle
of trade; Athens mints it only in rare emergencies, usually in a ration
to silver of 14 to I.” The smallest Athenian coins are of copper; eight
of these make an obol — a coin of iron or bronze, named from its
resemblance to nails or spits (obeliskot). Six obols make a drachma,
i.e., a handful; two drachmas make a gold stater; one hundred drachmas
make a mina; sixty minas make a tal- ent. A drachma in the first half of
the fifth century buys a bushel of grain, as a dollar does in
twentieth-century America.*“ There is no paper money in Athens, no
government bonds, no joint-stock corporations, no stock exchange.</p>
<p>But there are banks. They have a hard struggle to get a footing, for
those who have no need for loans denounce interest as a crime, and the
philoso- phers agree with them. The average fifth-century Athenian is a
hoarder; if he has savings he prefers to hide them rather than entrust
them to the banks. Some men lend money on mortgages, at 16 to 18 per
cent; some lend it, without interest, to their friends; some deposit
their money in tem- ple treasuries. The temples serve as banks, and lend
to individuals and states at a moderate interest; the temple of Apollo
at Delphi is in some measure an international bank for all Greece. There
are no private loans to governments, but occasionally one state lends to
another. Meanwhile the money-changer at his table (trapeza) begins in
the fifth century to re- ceive money on deposit, and to lend it to
merchants at interest rates that vary from 12 to 30 per cent according
to the risk; in this way he becomes a banker, though to the end of
ancient Greece he keeps his early name of trapezite, the man at the
table. He takes his methods from the Near East, improves them, and
passes them on to Rome, which hands them down to modem Europe. Soon
after the Persian War Themistocles deposits sev- enty talents (20,000)
with the Corinthian banker Philostephanus, very much as political
adventurers feather foreign nests for themselves today; this is the
earliest known allusion to secular — nontemple — banking. Towards the
end of the century Antisthenes and Archestratus establish what will
become, under Pasion, the most famous of all private Greek banks.
Through such trapezitai money circulates more freely and rapidly, and so
does more work, than before; and the facilities that they offer
stimulate creatively the expansion of Athenian trade.</p>
<p>• In this volume an obol is reckoned as equivalen t in buying power
to 17 cents in United States currency in 1938, a drachma as , a talent
as ooo. These equivalents are only approximate, for prices rose
throughout Greek history; cf. section V of this chapter.</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 1J, not industry or finance, is
the soul of Athenian economy. Though many producers still sell directly
to the consumer, a growing number of them require the intermediary of
the market, whose function it is to buy and store goods until the
consumer is ready to purchase them. In this way a class of retailers
arises, who peddle their wares through the streets, or in the wake of
armies, or at festivals or fairs, or offer them for sale in shops or
stalls in the agora or elsewhere in the town. To the shops come freemen
or metics or slaves to haggle with tradesmen and buy for the home. One
of the severest disabilities suffered by the “free” women of Athens is
that custom does not allow them to shop.*</p>
<p>Foreign commerce advances even faster than domestic trade, for the
Greek states have learned the advantages of an international division of
labor, and each specializes in some product; the shieldmaker, for
example, no longer goes from city to city at the call of those who need
him, but makes his shields in his shop and sends them out to the markets
of the classic world. In one century Athens moves from household economy
— wherein each household makes nearly all that it needs — to urban
economy — wherein each town makes nearly all that it needs — to
international economy — where each state is dependent upon imports, and
must make exports to pay for them. The Athenian fleet for two
generations keeps the Aegean clear of pirates, and from 480 to 430
commerce thrives as it never will again until Pompey suppresses piracy
in 67 b.c. The docks, warehouses, markets, and banks of the Piraeus
offer every facility for trade; soon the busy port becomes the chief
center of distribution and reshipment for the commerce between the East
and the West. “The arti cles which it is</p>
<p>difficult to get, one here, one there, from the rest of the world,”
says Isocrates, “all these it is easy to buy in Athens.”* “The magnitude
of our city,” says Thucydides, “draws the produce of the world into our
harbor, so that to the Athenian the fruits of other countries are as
familiar a luxury as those of his own.”“ From the Piraeus merchants
carry the wine, oil, wool, minerals, marble, pottery, arms, luxuries,
books, and works of art produced by the fields and shops of Attica; to
the Piraeus they bring grain from the Byzantium, Syria, Egypt, Italy,
and Sicily, fruit and cheese from Sicily and Phoenicia, meat from
Phoenicia and Italy, fish from the Black Sea, nuts from Paphlagonia,
copper from Cyprus, tin from England, iron from the Pontic coast, gold
from Thasos and Thrace, timber from Thrace and Cyprus, embroideries from
the Near East, wools, flax, and dyes from Phoenicia, spices from Cyrene,
swords from Chalcis, glass from Egypt, tiles from Corinth, beds from
Chios and Miletus, boots and bronzes from</p>
<p>276 THE LIFE OF GREECE (cHAP. XH</p>
<p>Etruria, ivory from Ethiopia, perfumes and ointments from Arabia,
slaves from Lydia, Syria, and Scythia. The colonies serve not only as
markets, but as shipping agents to send Athenian goods into the
interior; and though the cities of Ionia decay in the fifth century
because the trade that once passed there is diverted to the Propontis
and Caria during and after the Persian War, Italy and Sicily replace
them as outlets for the surplus prod- ucts and population of mainland
Greece. We may estimate the amount of Aegean commerce from the return of
1200 talents from a 5 per cent tax laid in 413 upon the imports and
exports of the cities in the Athenian Empire, indicating a trade of
44,000,000 a year.</p>
<p>The danger lurking in this prosperity is the growing dependence
of</p>
<p>Athens upon imported grain; hence her insistence upon controlling the
Hellespont and the Black Sea, her persistent colonizing of the coasts
and isles on the way to the straits, and her disastrous expeditions to
Egypt in 459 and to Sicily in 415. It is this dependence that persuades
Athens to transform the Confederacy of Delos into an empire; and when,
in 405, the Spartans destroy the Athenian fleet in the Hellespont, the
starvation and surrender of Athens are inevitable results. Nevertheless
it is this trade that makes Athens rich, and provides, with the imperial
tribute, the sinews of her cultural development. The merchants who
accompany their goods to all quarters of the Mediterranean come back
with changed perspective, and alert and open minds; they bring new ideas
and ways, break down ancient taboos and sloth, and replace the familial
conservatism of a rural aristocracy with the individualistic and
progressive spirit of a mercantile civilization. Here in Athens East and
West meet, and jar each other from their ruts. Old myths lose their
grasp on the souls of men, leisure rises, inquiry is supported, science
and philosophy grow. Athens becomes the most intensely alive city of her
time.</p>

<li>FREEMEN AND SLAVES</li>
</ol>
<p>Who does all this work? In the countryside it is done by citizens,
their families, and free hired men; in Athens it is done partly by
citizens, partly by freedmen, more by metics, mostly by slaves. The
shopkeepers, artisans, merchants, and bankers come almost entirely from
the voteless classes. The burgher looks down upon manual labor, and does
as little of it as he may. To work for a livelihood is considered
ignoble; even the professional prac- tice or teaching of music,
sculpture, or painting is accounted by many</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS *77</p>
<p>Greeks “a mean occupation.”* Hear blunt Xenophon, who speaks, how -
ever, as a proud member of the knightly class:</p>
<p>The base mechanic arts, so called … are held in ill repute by
civ-</p>
<p>ilized communities, and not unreasonably; seeing they are the
ruin</p>
<p>of the bodies of all concerned in them, workers and overseers alike,
who are forced to remain in sitting postures or to hug the gloom,</p>
<p>or else to crouch whole days confronting a furnace. Hand in hand</p>
<p>with physical enervation follows apace an enfeebling of soul,
while</p>
<p>the demand which these base mechanic arts make on the time of those
employed in them leaves them no leisure to devote to the claims of
friendship and the state.”</p>
<p>Trade is similarly scorned; to the aristocratic or philosophical
Greek it is merely money-making at the expense of others; it aims not to
create goods but to buy them cheap and sell them dear; no respectable
citizen will engage in it, though he may quietly invest in it and profit
from it so long as he lets others do the work. A freeman, says the
Greek, must be free from economic tasks; he must get slaves or others to
attdnd to his material con- cerns, even, if he can, to take care of his
property and his fortune; only by such liberation can he find time for
government, war, literature, and philosophy. Without a leisure class
there can be, in the Greek view, no standards of taste, no encouragement
of the arts, no civilization. No man who is in a hurry is quite
civilized.</p>
<p>Most of the functions associated in history with the middle class are
in Athens performed by metics — freemen of foreign birth who, though in-
eligible to citizenship, have fixed their domicile in Athens. For the
most part they are professional men, merchants, contractors,
manufacturers, managers, tradesmen, craftsmen, artists, who, in the
course of their wan- dering, have found in Athens the economic liberty,
opportunity, and stim- ulus which to them is far more vital than the
vote. The most important industrial undertakings, outside of mining, are
owned by metics; the ceram- ic industry is theirs completely; and
wherever middlemen can squeeze themselves in between producer and
consumer they are to be found. The law harasses them and protects them.
It taxes them like citizens, lays “liturgies” upon them, exacts military
service from them, and adds a poll tax for good measure; it forbids them
to own land or to marry into the family of a citizen; it excludes them
from its religious organization, and</p>
<p>•Plutarch, Pericles. Zimmem, The Greek Commonwealth, 272, and
Ferguson, Greek Imperialism, 61, feel that the Athenian disdain for
manual labor has been exaggerated; but cf. Glotz, Ancient Greece at
Works 160.</p>

<p>from direct appeal to its courts. But it welcomes them into its
economic life, appreciates their industry and skill, enforces their
contracts, gives them religious freedom, and guards their wealth against
violent revolution. Some of them flaunt their riches vulgarly, but some
of them, too, work quietly in science, literature, and the arts,
practice law or medicine, and create schools of rhetoric and philosophy.
In the fourth century they will pro- vide the authors and subject of the
comic drama, and in the third they will set the cosmopolitan tone of
Hellenistic society. They itch for citi- zenship, but they love Athens
proudly, and contribute painfully to finance her defense against her
enemies. Through them, chiefly, the fleet is main- tained, the empire is
supported, and the commercial supremacy of Athens is preserved.</p>
<p>Mingled with the metics in political disabilities and economic oppor-
tunities are the freedmen — those who once were slaves. For though it is
inconvenient to liberate a slave, since usually he must be replaced by
an- other, yet the promise of freedom is an economical stimulus to a
young slave; and many Greeks, as death approaches, reward their most
loyal slaves with manumission. The slave may be freed through ransoming
by relatives or friends, as in the case of Plato; or the state,
indemnifying his owner, may free him for service in war; or he himself
may save his obols until he can buy his liberty. Like the metic, the
freedman engages in in- dustry, trade, or finance; at the lowest he may
do for pay the work of a slave, at the top he may become a magnate of
industry. Mylias manages Demosthenes’ armor factory; Pasion and Phormio
become the richest bankers in Athens. The freedman is especially valued
as an executive, for no one is more severe with slaves than the man who
has come up from slavery,*® and has known only oppression all the days
of his life.</p>
<p>Beneath these three classes — citizens, metics, and freedmen — are
the 115,- 000 slaves of Attica.* They are recruited from unransomed
prisoners of war, victims of slave raids, infants rescued from exposure,
wastrels, and criminals. Few of them in Greece are Greeks. The Hellene
looks upon foreigners as natural slaves, since they so readily give
absolute obedience to a king, and he does not account the servitude of
such men to Greeks as</p>
<p>•The figure is Gomme’s, l.c. Possibly the number was much greater:
Suidas, on the authority of a speech uncertainly attributed to
Hypereides in 338, gives the number of adult male slaves alone as
150,000;“ and according to the unreliable Athenaeus the census of
Attica</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 279</p>
<p>unreasonable. But he balks at the enslavement of a Greek, and seldom
stoops to it. Greek traders buy slaves as they would merchandise, and
offer them for sale at Chios, Delos, Corinth, Aegina, Athens, and
wherever else they can find purchasers. The slave dealers at Athens are
among the richest of the metics. In Delos it is not unusual for a
thousand slaves to be sold in a day; Cimon, after the battle of the
Eurymedon, puts 20,000 prisoners on the slave market.“ At Athens there
is a mart where slaves stand ready for naked inspection and bargaining
purchase at any time. They cost from half a mina to ten minas (0 to
000). They may be bought for direct use, or for investment; men and
women in Athens find it profitable to buy slaves and rent them to homes,
factories, or mines; the return is as high as 33 per cent.” Even the
poorest citizen has a slave or two; Aeschines, to prove his poverty,
complains that his family has only seven; rich homes may have fifty.“
The Athenian government employs a number of slaves as clerks,
attendants, minor officials, or policemen; many of these receive their
clothing and a daily “allowance” of half a drachma, and are permitted to
live where they please.</p>
<p>In the countryside the slaves are few, and are chiefly women servants
in the home; in northern Greece and most of the Peloponnesus serfdom
makes slavery superfluous. In Corinth, Megara, and Athens slaves do most
of the manual labor, and women slaves most of the domestic toil; but
slaves do also a great part of the clerical, and some of the executive
work, in industry, commerce, and finance. Most skilled labor is
performed by freemen, freedmen or metics; and there are no learned
slaves as there will be in the Hellenistic period and in Rome. The slave
is seldom allowed to bring up children of his own, for it is cheaper to
buy a slave than to rear one. If the slave misbehaves he is whipped; if
he testifies he is tortured; when he is struck by a freeman he must not
defend himself. But if he is subjected to great cruelty he may flee to a
temple, and then his master must sell him. In no case may his master
kill him. So long as he labors he has more security than many who in
other civilizations are not called slaves; when he is ill, or old, or
there is no work for him to do, his master does not throw him upon
public relief, but continues to take care of him. If he is loyal he is
treated like a faithful servant, almost like a member of the family. He
is often allowed to go into business, provided he will pay his owner a
part of his earnings. He is free from taxation and from mili- tary
service. Nothing in his costume distinguishes him, in fifth-century
Athens, from the freeman; indeed the “Old Oligarch” who about 425 writes
a pamphlet on The Polity of the Atheniam complains that the slave</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>does not make way for citizens on the street, that he talks freely,
and acts in every detail as if he were the equal of the citizen.® Athens
is known for mildness to her slaves; it is a common judgment that slaves
are better off in democratic Athens than poor freemen in oligarchic
states.“ Slave revolts, though feared, are rare in Attica.“</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Athenian conscience is disturbed by the existence of
slavery, and the philosophers who defend it reveal almost as clearly as
those who denounce it that the moral development of the nation has
outrun its institutions. Plato condemns the enslavement of Greeks by
Greeks, but for the rest accepts slavery on the ground that some people
have under- privileged minds.“ Aristotle looks upon the slave as an
animate tool, and thinks that slavery will continue in some form until
all menial work can be done by self-operating machines.“ The average
Greek, though kind to his slaves, has no notion of how a cultured
society can get along without slavery; to abolish slavery, he feels, it
would be necessary to abolish Athens. Others are more radical. The Cynic
philosophers condemn slavery out- right; their successors, the Stoics,
will condenm it more politely; Euripides again and again stirs his
audiences by sympathetic pictures of war-captured slaves; and the
sophist Alcidamas goes about Greece preaching, unmolested, the doctrin e
of Rousseau almost in the words of Rousseau; “God has sent all men into
the world free, and nature has made no man a slave.”“ But slavery goes
on.</p>
<p>V. THE WAR OF THE CLASSES</p>
<p>The exploitation of man by man is less severe in Athens and Thebes
than in Sparta or Rome, but it is adequate to the purpose. There are no
castes among the freemen in Athens, and a man may by resolute ability
rise to any- thing but citizenship; hence, in part, the fever and
turbulence of Athenian life. There is no tense class distinction between
employer and employee except in the mines; usually the master works
beside his men, and personal acquaintance dulls the edge of
exploitation. The wage of nearly all arti- sans, of whatever class, is a
drachma for each actual day of work;“ but un- skilled workers may get as
low as three obols (50 cents) a day.“ Piecework tends to replace
timework as the factory system develops; and wages begin to vary more
widely. A contractor may hire slaves from their owner for a rental of
one to four obols a day.“ We may estimate the buying power of these
wages by comparing Greek prices with our ovra. In 414 a house and estate
in Attica cost twelve hundred drachmas; a medivmus, or 1 *4</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 28 l</p>
<p>bushels, of barley costs a drachma in the sixth century, two at the
close of the fifth, three in the fourth, five in the time of Alexander;
a sheep costs a drachma in Solon’s day, ten to twenty at the end of the
fifth century;“ in Athens as elsewhere currency tends to increase faster
than goods, and prices rise. At the close of the fourth century prices
are five times as high as at the opening of the sixth; they double from
480 to 404, and again from 404 to 330.“</p>
<p>A single man lives comfortably on 120 drachmas (20) a month;* we may
judge from this the condition of the worker who earns thirty drachmas
per month, and has a family. It is true that the state comes to his
relief in times of great stress, and then distributes corn at a nominal
price. But he observes that the goddess of liberty is no friend to the
goddess of equality, and that under the free laws of Athens the strong
grow stronger, the rich richer, while the poor remain poor.*“
Individualism stimulates the able, and degrades the simple; it creates
wealth magnificently, and concentrates it dangerously. In Athens, as in
other states, cleverness gets all that it can, and mediocrity gets the
rest. The landowner profits from the rising value of his land; the
merchant does his best, despite a hundred laws, to secure corners and
monopolies; the speculator reaps, through the high rate of interest on
loans, the lion’s share of the proceeds of industry and trade.
Demagogues arise who point out to the poor the inequality of human
possessions, and conceal from them the inequality of human economic
ability; the poor man, face to face with wealth, becomes conscious of
his poverty, broods over his unrewarded merits, and dreams of perfect
states. Bitterer than the war of Greece with Persia, or of Athens with
Sparta, is, in all the Greek states, the war of class with class.</p>
<p>In Attica it begins with the conflict between the new rich and the
landed aristocracy. The ancient families still love the soil, and live
for the greater part on their estates. Division of the patrimony through
many generations has made the average holding small* (the rich
Alcibiades has only seventy acres), and the squire in most cases labors
personally on the soil, or in the management of his property. But though
the aristocrat is not rich, he is proud; he adds his father’s name to
his own as a title of nobility, and he remains aloof as long as he can
from the mercantile bourgeoisie which is capturing the wealth of Athens’
growing trade. His wife, however, cries for a city home and the varied
life and opportunities of the metropolis; his</p>
<p>•The great fortunes of Greek antiquity were of course modest in
amount by modem standards. Callias, the wealthiest of the Athenians, is
said to have had two hundred talents (,200,000) ; Nicias, one
hundred.”</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap, xn</p>
<p>daughters wish to Kve in Athens and snare rich husbands; his sons
hope to find hetairai there and to give gay parties in the style of the
nouveaux riches. As the aristocrat cannot compete in luxury with the
merchants and manu- facturers, he accepts them, or their children, as
sons-in-law or daughters- in-law; they are anxious to climb, and willing
to pay. The upshot is a union of the rich in land with the rich in
money, and the formation of an upper class of oligarchs, envied and
hated by the poor, angry at the excesses and extravagance of democracy,
and fearful of revolution.</p>
<p>It is the insolence of the new wealth that brings on the second phase
of the class war — the struggle of the poorer citizens against the rich.
Many of the bourgeoisie flaunt their wealth like Alcibiades, but few
others can so charm the “mechanic multitude” by dramatic audacity and
elegance of person or speech. Young men conscious of ability and
frustrated with poverty translate their personal need for opportunity
and place into a gen- eral gospel of revolt; and intellectuals eager for
new ideas and the applause of the oppressed formulate for them the aims
of their rebellion.” They call</p>
<p>In the face of this threat the rich band themselves in secret
organizations pledged to take common action against what Plato, despite
his communism, will call the “monstrous beast” of t he aroused and
hungry mob.“ The free workers also organize — have at least since Solon
organized — themselves into clubs {eranoi, thiasoi) of stonemasons,
marble cutters, woodworkers, ivory- workers, potters, fishermen, actors,
etc.; Socrates is a member of a sculptor’s thiasos.*’^ But these groups
are not so much trade-unions as mutual benefit</p>
<p>• The sculptors and architects of Greece formed a guild of builders,
with their own re - ligious mysteries, and became the forerunners of the
Freemasons of later Europe.*®</p>
<p>CHAP.Xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 283</p>
<p>societies: they come together in meeting places called synods or
synagogues, have banquets and games, and worship a patron deity; they
make payments to sick members, and contract collectively for specific
enterprises; but they do not enter visibly into the Athenian class war.
The battle is fought on the fields of literature and politics.
Pamphleteers like the “Old Oligarch” issue denunciations or defenses of
democracy. The comic poets, since their plays require rich men to
finance their production, are on the side of the drachmas, and pour
ridicule upon the radical leaders and their utopias. In the
Ecclesiazusae (392) Aristophanes introduces us to the lady communist
Praxagora, who makes an oration as follows:</p>
<p>I want all to have a share of everything, and all property to be
in</p>
<p>common; there will no longer be either rich or poor; no longer shall
we see one man harvesting vast tracts of land, while another has not
ground enough to be buried in. … I intend that there shall only be</p>
<p>one and the same condition of life for all. … I shall begin by
making</p>
<p>land, money, everything that is private property, common to all. . .
. Women shall belong to all men in common.“</p>
<p>“But who,” asks Blepyrus, “will do the work?” “The slaves,” is her
reply. In another comedy, the Plutus (408), Aristophanes allows Poverty,
who is threatened with extinction, to defend herself as the necessary
goad to human toil and enterprise:</p>
<p>I am the sole cause of all your blessings, and your safety
depends</p>
<p>upon me alone. . . . Who would wish to hammer iron, build ships,</p>
<p>sew, turn, cut up leather, bake bricks, bleach linen, tan hides,
or</p>
<p>break up the soil with the plow and gamer the gifts of Demeter if</p>
<p>he could live in idleness and free from all this work? … If your
sys-</p>
<p>tem 〔communism〕 is applied . . . you will not be able to sleep in
a</p>
<p>bed, for no more will ever be manufactured; nor on carpets, for</p>
<p>who would weave them if he had gold?®</p>
<p>The reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles are the first achievement of
the democratic revolt. Pericles is a man of judgment and moderation; he
does not wish to destroy the rich but to preserve them and their
enterprise by easing the condition of the poor; but after his death
(429) the democracy becomes so radical that the oligarchic party
conspires again with Sparta, and makes in 41 1, and once more in 404, a
rich man’s revolution. Never - theless, because wealth is great in
Athens and trickles down to many, and because fear of a slave uprising
gives the citizenry pause, the class war in Athens is milder, and sooner
reaches a working compromise, than in Greek states where the middle
class is not strong enough to mediate between rich</p>
<p>284 THE LIFE OF GREECE ( CHAP. XII</p>
<p>and poor. At Samos, in 412, the radicals seize the government,
execute two hundred aristocrats, banish four hundred more, divide up the
lands and houses among themselves,” and develop another society like
that which they have overthrown. At Leontini, in 422, the commoners
expel the oligarchs, but soon afterward take to flight. At Corcyra, in
427, the oli- garchs assassinate sixty leaders of the popular party; the
democrats seize the government, imprison four hundred aristocrats, try
fifty of them before a kind of Committee of Public Safety, and execute
all fifty at once; seeing which a considerable number of the surviving
prisoners slay one another, others kill themselves, and the rest are
walled up in the temple in which they have sought sanctuary, and are
starved to death. Thucydides describes the class war in Greece in a
timeless passage:</p>
<p>During seven days the Corcyraeans were engaged in butchering</p>
<p>those of their fellow-citizens whom they regarded as their enemies;
and although the crime imputed was that of attempting to put down the
democracy, some were slain also for private hatred, others by</p>
<p>their debtors because of the monies owed to them. Death thus raged in
every shape, and as usually happens at such times, there was no</p>
<p>length to which violence did not go; sons were killed by their</p>
<p>fathers, and suppliants were dragged from the altar or slain upon
it.</p>
<p>. . . Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the
places</p>
<p>where it arrived last, from having heard what had been done before,
carried to a still greater excess the refinement of their inventions</p>
<p>. . . and the atrocity of their reprisals. . . . Corcyra gave the
first</p>
<p>example of these crimes … of the revenge exacted by the governed</p>
<p>— who had never experienced equitable treatment, or, indeed, aught
but violence from their rulers — when their hour came; of the iniqui-
tous resolves of those who desired to get rid of their accustomed pov-
erty, and ardently coveted their neighbors’ goods; and the savage and
pitiless excesses into which men who had begun the struggle not</p>
<p>in a class but in a party spirit, were hurried by their passions. . .
.</p>
<p>In the confusion into which life was now thrown in the cities,</p>
<p>human nature, always rebelling against the law and now its master,
gladly showed itself ungoverned in passion, above respect for jus-</p>
<p>tice, and the enemy of all superiority. . . . Reckless audacity
came</p>
<p>now to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation,
specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unman-</p>
<p>liness; ability to see all sides of a question was accounted
inability</p>
<p>to act on any. . . .</p>
<p>The cause of all these evils was the lust for power arising from</p>
<p>greed and ambition. . . . The leaders in the cities, each
provided</p>
<p>CHAP, xn) WORK AND WEALTH IN ATHENS 285</p>
<p>with the fairest professions, on the one side with the cry of the</p>
<p>political equality of the people, on the other of a moderate
aris-</p>
<p>tocracy, sought prizes for themselves in those public interests which
they pretended to cherish; and, recoiling from no means in their</p>
<p>struggle for ascendancy, engaged in the direst excesses. . . .
Reli-</p>
<p>gion was in honor with neither party, but the use of fair phrases</p>
<p>to arrive at guilty ends was in high reputation. . . . The ancient
sim-</p>
<p>plicity into which honor so largely entered was laughed down, and</p>
<p>disappeared; and society became divided into Camps in which no</p>
<p>man trusted his fellow. . . . Meanwhile the moderate part of the</p>
<p>citizens perished between the two, either for not joining in the</p>
<p>quarrel, or because envy would not suffer them to escape. . . .
The</p>
<p>whole Hellenic world was convulsed.“</p>
<p>Athens survives this turbulence because every Athenian is at heart an
individualist, and loves private property; and because the Athenian
govern- ment finds a practicable medium between socialism and
individualism in a moderate regulation of business and wealth. The state
is not afraid to regu- late: it sets a limit upon the size of dowries,
the cost of funerals, and the dress of women;® it taxes and supervises
trade, enforces fair weights and measures and honest quality so far as
the ingenuity of human rascality per- mits;® it limits the export of
food, and enacts sharp laws to govern and chasten the practices of
merchants and tradesmen. It watches the grain trade carefully, and
legislates severely against corners — even to the death penalty — by
forbidding the purchase of more than seventy-five bushels of wheat at a
time; it interdicts loans on outgoing cargoes unless the return shipment
is to bring grain to the Piraeus; it requires that all com loaded by
vessels owned in Athens shall be brought to the Piraeus; and it
prohibits the export of more than a third of any com cargo that reaches
that port.” By keeping a reserve of grain in state-owned storehouses,
and pouring this upon the market when prices rise too rapidly, Athens
sees to it that the price of bread shall never be exorbitant, that
milHonaires shall not be cre- ated out of the hunger of the people, and
that no Athenian shall starve.® The state regulates wealth through
taxation and liturgies, and persuades or com- pels rich men to supply
funds for the fleet, the drama, and the theoric pay- ments that enable
the poor to attend the plays and the games. For the rest Athens protects
freedom of trade, private property, and the opportunity to profit,
deeming them the necessary implements of human liberty, and the most
powerful stimuli to industry, commerce, and prosperity.</p>
<p>Under this system of economic individualism tempered with
socialistic</p>

<p>regulation, wealth accumulates in Athens, and spreads sufficiently to
pre- vent a radical revolution; to the end of ancient Athens private
property remains secure. The number of citizens with a comfortable
income doubles between 480 and 431;“ the public revenue grows, public
expenditures rise, and yet the treasury is full beyond any precedent in
Greek history. The economic basis of Athenian freedom, enterprise, art,
and thought is firmly laid, and will bear without strain every
extravagance of the Golden Age except the war by which all Greece will
be ruined.</p>
