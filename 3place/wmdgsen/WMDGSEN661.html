<p>Faith and Reason in France</p>
<p>1648 — 1715</p>
<p>I. THE VICISSITUDES OF CARTESIANISM</p>
<p>T HE dictionary of the French Academy in 1694 defined philosopher
as</p>
<p>one who devotes himself to research work in connection with the</p>
<p>various sciences, and who seeks from their effects to trace their
causes and principles. A name 〔also〕 applied to one who lives a quiet
and</p>
<p>secluded life remote from the stir and troubles of the world. It
is</p>
<p>occasionally used to denote someone of undisciplined mind who re-
gards himself as above the responsibilities and duties of civil life.
1</p>
<p>From the first part of this definition it is clear that philosophy
and science were not yet distinguished; science, as “natural
philosophy,” would remain a branch of philosophy till the nineteenth
century. From the final portion of the definition we gather that the
Forty Immortals, under Louis XIV, sniffed a revolutionary odor in the
philosophic air, as if the harbingers of the Enlightenment had already
spoken their prologue.</p>
<p>Between three horns of the definition the intellectual legacy of Rene
Descartes meandered through renown to repudiation. The legacy itself had
three horns: one sounded the trumpet of doubt as the prelude to all phi-
losophy; another announced the universal mechanism of the external
world; the third played the welcome tunes of the traditional creed, and
drew God, free will, and immortality out of the vortices of the world.
Descartes had begun with doubt and ended with piety; and his heirs could
take him at either end. The ladies of the early salons — the femmes
savantes satirized by Moliere in 1672 — found some exciting respite from
the rosary in the whirlpools of the new cosmology. Mme. de Sevigne
reported the Cartesian philosophy as an after-dinner topic in her
circle; she and Mmes. de Grignan, de Sable, and de La Fayette were all
cartesiennes. Fragrant women attended the lectures given in Paris by
followers of Descartes. 2 Great nobles took up the philosophic mode;
Cartesian discourses were pronounced each week in the chateau of the Due
de Luynes, and in the Paris palace of the Prince de Conde, and in “the
most magnificent hotels of the capita l.” 3 Religious orders —
Oratorians, Benedictines, Augustinians —</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>taught the new philosophy in their schools. It became the fashion to
praise reason in science and human affairs, while carefully
subordinating it, in religion, to divine revelation as interpreted by
the Catholic Church. The Jansenists and Port-Royal accepted Cartesianism
as an elegant reconciliation of religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>But their most brilliant convert, Blaise Pascal, denounced
Cartesianism as the vestibule of atheism. “I cannot pardon Descartes,”
he said; “he would have been glad, in all his philosophy, to dispense
with God; but he could not avoid allowing him a fillip 〔a snap of the
finger released from the thumb〕 to put the world in motion; after that
he had no use for God.” 4 On this point the Jesuits agreed with Pascal;
after 1650 they rejected Car- tesianism as a subtle, even if unintended,
corrosive of religious faith. The Sorbonne wished to proscribe
Descartes; Boileau defended him; Ninon de Lenclos and others persuaded
Moliere to write a satire on the Sorbonne; the Sorbonne deferred its
censure. 6 The learned Huet, after long accepting Cartesianism, turned
against it as blowing hot and cold for and against Christianity.
Theologians were increasingly alarmed by the difficulty of reconciling
transubstantiation with Descartes’ view of matter as pure ex - tension.
In 1665 Louis XIV forbade the teaching of the ambivalent philos- ophy in
the College Royal, and in 1671 he extended the prohibition to the
University of Paris. In 1687 Bossuet joined in the attack.</p>
<p>These condemnations revived interest in Cartesianism, and drew atten-
tion to its skeptical overture, the Discours de la methode; the initial
doubt of that essay spread subterraneanly; its orthodox appendages
withered away; in the eighteenth century hardly anything remained of the
once victorious system except its attempt to reduce the external world
to a mechanism obeying the laws of physics and chemistry. Every new dis-
covery of science seemed to support this Cartesian mechanism and to dis-
credit the Cartesian theology. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
found no place in Descartes’ picture of the cosmos; nor was Christ
there; all that remained was a dieu faineant who gave the world an
initial push and then retired from the scene except as a guarantor of
Descartes’ intuitions. This was not the majestic and awful God of the
Old Testament, nor the merci- ful Father of the New; he was the God of
deism, impersonal, functionless, negligible, subject to invariable laws;
who would think of praying to such an Epicurean futility? Already in
1669 and 1678 the books of Guillaume Lamy, professor on the medical
faculty at the University of Paris, ex- pounded a completely mechanistic
psychology anticipating Condillac’s Traite des sensations (1754), and a
materialistic philosophy anticipating La Mettrie’s V Homme machine
(1748). And amid the fracas Cyrano de Bergerac made his scandalous
voyages to the moon and the sun.</p>
<p>6 oo</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CYRANO DE BERGERAC: 1619-55</li>
</ol>
<p>For most of us he is the lover travestied by Rostand, and losing
every race to Venus by a nose. The real Cyrano was not quite frustrated;
he played vivaciously with life and love, and frittered away his time to
the top of his bent. To the usual education of a wellborn lad he added
(with Moli&amp;re) eager attendance on the lectures of Pierre Gassendi,
the amiable priest who liked Epicurus the materialist and Lucretius the
atheist. Cyrano became an esprit especially fort, a libertin in both
senses, as freethinker and loose liver. He joined in Paris a company of
sacrilegious roisterers, earned repute as a duelist, served in the army,
was for a while incapacitated by his wounds, and retired from active
venery to philosophy. He wrote the first French philosophical play, and
opened the road to Swift by making fun of mankind via travels to
unfrequented parts of the cosmos. He laughed at the venerable
St. Augustine, “that grand personage who assures us, though his mind was
illuminated by the Holy Ghost, that in his time the earth was as flat as
an oven, and that it floated on the water like half an orange.” 6</p>
<p>Cyrano tried his pen in almost every literary form, seldom seriously,
but usually finding the nerve. His comedy, Le Pedant joue, seemed to
Moliere good enough for poaching a scene or two. His tragedy, La Mort
d’Agrip - pine, was acted once in 1640, was immediately proscribed by
the authorities, and had to wait till i960 to reach the boards again.
But it was published in 1654, an d soon the wild young men of Paris were
shouting the atheistic lines of its Sejan:</p>
<p>Que sont-ils done ces diem? Des enfants de I’effroi;</p>
<p>Des beaux riens qu’on adore et sans savoir pourquoi . .</p>
<p>Des diem que I’homme fait, et qui n’ont pas fait I’homme</p>
<p>— “What, then, are these gods? The offspring of our fears; pretty
nothings that we adore without knowing why. . . ; Gods whom man has
made, and who never made man.” And on immortality:</p>
<p>JJne heure apres la mort notre dme evanouie</p>
<p>Sera ce qu’elle etait une heure avant la vie</p>
<p>— “One hour after death our vanished soul will be that which it was
an hour before life.”</p>
<p>Soon after this play was printed, Cyrano was struck on the head by a
falling beam, and died of the blow, aged thirty-six. He left a
manuscript which was published in two parts: Histoire comique des etats
et empires</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 6oi</p>
<p>de la lime, (1657), and Histoire comique des etats et empires du
soleil (1662). They were a comic kind of science fiction, based upon the
Car- tesian cosmology, and deriving the planets from vortices formed by
the revolutionary agitation of primeval matter. Cyrano suggested that
the plan- ets had once blazed like the sun, but,</p>
<p>in the compass of time, suffered so great a loss of light and heat
by</p>
<p>the continual emission of the corpuscles causing such phenomena, that
they have become cold, dark, and almost powerless pulps. We find</p>
<p>even that sun spots . . . increase in size from day to day. Now
who</p>
<p>knows if these are not a crust forming on the sun’s surface from
its</p>
<p>mass that cools in proportion as light is lost, and if the sun will
not</p>
<p>become … an opaque globe like the earth? 7</p>
<p>Propelled by rockets, Cyrano leaves the earth, and swiftly reaches
the moon. He notes that through three quarters of the way he feels the
earth drawing him backward, then, through the final quarter, he feels
the attrac- tion of the moon. “This, I told myself, was because the mass
of the moo n was less than that of the earth; hence the sphere of its
action was corre- spondingly less in space.” 8 Landing dazed, he finds
himself in a Garden of Eden. He falls into an argument with Elijah about
original sin, and is ex- pelled from the garden into the primitive
wastelands of the satellite. There he encounters a tribe of animals
twelve cubits long, fashioned like men but walking on all fours. One of
these, having served in Athens as the daemon of Socrates, speaks
philosophic Greek. He informs Cyrano that walking on all fours is the
natural and healthy way; that these lunar gentlemen have a hundred
senses, not five or six, and perceive countless realities hidden from
mankind. (Fontenelle, Voltaire, and Diderot will play with this specula-
tion.) Cyrano’s fancy runs wild: the lunars feed only on vapors pressed
from foods, not on foods themselves; hence they are saved the nuisance
and noises of digestion, the indignities and anachronisms of
elimination. The lunar laws are made by the young, who are revered by
the old; celibacy and chastity are condemned; suicide, cremation, and
large noses are praised. The aforesaid daemon of Socrates explains that
the world was not created, but is eternal; that creation out of nothing
(taught by the Scholastics) is inconceivable; that the eternity of the
universe is no more difficult to accept than the eternity of God;
indeed, the hypothesis of a God is quite unneces- sary, since the world
is a self-propelled and self-perpetuating machine. Cyrano argues that
there must be a God, for he has with his own eyes seen miraculous cures;
the daemon laughs these away as due to suggestion or imagination.
Orthodoxy is revenged by a powerful Ethiopian, who grasps Cyrano in one
arm, the daemon in the other, carries the daemon to hell, and,</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>en route, deposits Cyrano in Italy, where all the neighborhood dogs
howl at him because he smells of the moon. Jonathan Swift was attracted,
too.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MALEBRANCHE: 1 6 3 8 — 1 7 1 5</li>
</ol>
<p>Against the infidel progeny of Gassendi and Descartes the faith found
powerful defenders not only in Pascal, Bossuet, and Fenelon, but in one
of the subtlest metaphysicians of modern times.</p>
<p>Nicolas de Malebranche was an almost exact contemporary of Louis XIV:
bom a month before him, dying a month after him. There was no further
resemblance. Nicolas was gentle of spirit and pure of life. As his
father was secretary to Louis XIII, and his uncle was viceroy of Canada,
he had every advantage of birth and rearing except health; his body was
feeble and deformed, and only a frugal regimen in the routine and peace
of monastic life can explain his seventy-seven years. At twenty-two he
joined the Congregation of the Oratory, a religious order dedicated to
meditation and preaching. At twenty-six he was ordained priest.</p>
<p>In that same year he came upon Descartes’ TraitS de Vhomme. He was
transported by both its argument and its style. He became a Cartesian
with a sublime faith in reason; and he at once resolved to prove by
reason the Catholic creed in which he had rooted his life and his hopes.
This was a brave move away from Pascal back to St. Thomas Aquinas; it
showed the splendid confidence of youth, but it exposed the citadel of
faith to the in- roads of reason. After ten years of study and writing,
Malebranche issued in four volumes (1674) one of the classics of French
philosophy, De la Recherche de la verite ( The Search for Truth). Here,
as by all the philos- ophers of France, the moral obligation to be
intelligible was accepted, and philosophy became literature.</p>
<p>Descartes had not only begun his lucubrations with the self, but had
set such a gulf between the body physical and mechanical and the mind
spirit- ual and free, that no interaction between them could be
conceived. And yet that interaction seemed indisputable: an idea could
move an arm or an army, and a drug could muddle the mind. Half the
puzzling of Descartes’ successors was devoted to bridging the gap
between flesh and thought.</p>
<p>A Flemish philosopher, Arnold Geulincx, prepared for Malebranche —
and for Spinoza and Leibniz — by denying the interaction. The material
body does not act upon the immaterial mind or vice versa; when either
seems to act upon the other it is only because God has created reality
in two distinct streams of events, the one physical, the other mental;
their synchronism is like that of two clocks, set to the same second and
speed and striking the same hours simultaneously, but operating quite
independ-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 603</p>
<p>ently of each other except that both have one source — the
intelligence that set and started them. So God is the sole source of
both the physical and mental series of causes and effects; the mental
state is the occasion, not the cause, of the apparently resultant
physical motion; and the physical motion — event or sensation — is
merely the occasion of the mental state that</p>
<p>Malebranche made this hesitant “occasionalism” complete. God is
always the cause of both the physical act and the mental state; their
interaction is illusory; neither ever acts upon the other, t “God alone
drives back the air which He Himself has made me breathe. … It is not I
who breathe; I</p>
<p>breathe despite myself. It is not I who speak to you; I merely wish
to speak to you .” 9 God 〔the total energy of the universe〕 is the
only power. What- ever moves or thinks does so because the divine power
acts through the physical and mental processes. Motion is God acting in
material forms; thought is God thinking in us.</p>
<p>In this apparently deterministic philosophy there are countless
difficul- ties, which in later treatises Malebranche tried to resolve.
He struggled to harmonize some degree of free will in man with the
universal agency of God, and to reconcile evil and suffering and
multitudinous deviltry with the sole and omnipresent causality of an
omnipotent and omniscient benevo- lence; we shall not follow him into
these labyrinths. But in the course of his wandering he leaves a helpful
thread of psychology. Sensations, he thinks, are in the body, not in the
mind; the mind has ideas, and knows objects only as bundles of ideas —
of structure, size, color, odor, solidity, sound, temperature, taste.
These idea complexes are built up not merely from the object; most of
the qualities here named are not in the object; and many of our
judgments about the object — that it is large, small, bright, dim,
heavy, light, hot, cold, quickly moving or slow — describe the position,
condition, and attitude of the observer rather than the attributes of
the thing observed. We do not know things; we know only our prejudiced
and transformed perceptions and ideas. (All this a generation before
Locke and Berkeley.)</p>
<h1

emendation of this “psychophysical parallelism” may help us to see some
sense</h1>
<p>t Compare this theological statement with the determinist doctrine
that every motion in matter, and every mental state, is caused by the
total past, and that the immediate physical agents, and the self and
“free will,” are the instruments of this total force, or cosmic
energy,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>604</p>
<p>Despite his spiritualistic background, Malebranche, after Descartes
and Hobbes, gives physiological explanations of habit, memory, and
association of ideas. Habit is a readiness with which the animal
spirits, as the result of similar experiences or actions often repeated,
flow in certain grooves or channels of the body. Memory is the
reactivation of associations created in experience. Ideas tend to be
associated according to their past sequence or contiguity. Strength of
character, power of will, are the force of animal spirits flowing along
the fibers of the brain, deepening the grooves of asso- ciation and the
vividness of imagination.</p>
<p>Pious though Malebranche was, there were many elements in his philos-
ophy that disturbed that alert watchman of orthodoxy, Benigne Bossuet.
In a clever move to divert the passionate pen of Antoine Amauld from the
logic of Jansenism to the succor of the proper faith, he persuaded him
to comb Malebranche for hidden heresies. The philosopher defended
himself in a series of treatises as eloquent and incredible as the
first; and the con- troversy continued from 1683 to 1697. Bossuet
brought Fenelon’s light artillery to the attack. Mme. de Sevigne, seeing
that mice were devouring her crops and caterpillars her trees,
complained that she found little conso- lation in Malebranche’s view of
evil as a necessary element in the best of all possible worlds. 10</p>
<p>To offset these critics Malebranche had many fervent friends. Young
men and old women found in his doctrine of God as the only agent in all
actions a mystic pleasure of surrender and divine union. Frenchmen and
foreigners wore a path to his cell; one Englishman said that he came to
France to see only two celebrities, Louis XIV and Malebranche. 11
Berkeley came, all reverence, and engaged the old priest in a long
discussion. Soon afterward Malebranche, seventy-seven, weakened; he grew
thinner every day, until his mind had hardly any body left to serve as
occasion for his thought. On October 13, 1715, he passed away in his
sleep.</p>
<p>His fame faded rapidly after his death, for his religious philosophy
was not in tune with the skepticism and revelry of the Regency, and
still less with the ensuing tendency of the philosopher to replace
divine Providence with a world machine. But his influence appeared in
Leibniz’ attempt to show that the actual was the best possible world; in
Berkeley’s view that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 605</p>
<p>Above all, the system of occasionalism served as a halfway house
between Descartes and Spinoza. Descartes saw mechanism in matter, but
liberty in mind; Malebranche saw God as sole cause in every action of
every mind; Spinoza, quite as “God -intoxi cated” as the monk, agreed
with him that the mental and physical series were parallel products of
one creative force. Unwittingly the pious Oratorian, seeing God
everywhere, had taught, even to the faithful, a pantheism that needed
only the phrase Deus sive natura — God or nature — to become the
philosophy of Spinoza, and of the Enlightenment.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PIERRE BAYLE: 1647-1706</li>
</ol>
<p>The “Father of the Enlightenment” was the son of a Huguenot m inister
serving the town of Carla in the countship of Foix, under the Pyrenees.
Pierre lived there his first twenty-two years, imbibing Greek, Latin,
and Calvinism. He was a sensitive, impressionable youth. Sent to the
Jesuit college at Toulouse (1669) to get the best classical education
within his family’s reach and means, he fell in love with his teachers,
and was soon converted to Catholicism — so fervently that he tried to
convert his father and brother. They bore with him patiently, and
seventeen months later he returned to the parental faith. But now, as a
relapsed heretic, he was subject to prosecution by the Roman Church. To
protect him the father sent him to the Calvinist University of Geneva
(1670), hoping that Pierre would enter the Protestant ministry. There,
however, Bayle discovered the works of Descartes, and began to doubt all
forms of Christianity.</p>
<p>His schooling completed, he lived as a tutor in Geneva, Rouen,
and</p>
<p>Paris, and rose to a professorship in philosophy at a Huguenot
seminary in Sedan (1675). In 1681 the seminary was closed by order of
Louis XIV, as part of his war of attrition against the Edict of Nantes.
Bayle found refuge in Rotterdam, and a berth as professor of history and
philosophy in the £cole Illustre, the municipal academy. He was among
the first of many intellectual emigres who in this age made the Dutch
Republic a citadel of independent thought.</p>
<p>His salary was small, but he was content to live simply so long as he
had access to books. He never married, preferring a library to a wife.
He was not unmindful of feminine graces and charms, and would have been
grateful for the tender solicitude of a good woman, but he suffered all
his life from headaches and an associated “megrim,” or melancholia, and
doubtless he hesitated to bind another spirit to his ills. He had his
cynical moments, how- ever, for when a French Jesuit, Father Maimbourg,
in a History of</p>
<p>Calvinism, argued that Catholic priests had accepted conversion to
Prot-</p>
<p>606 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>estantdsm in order to marry, Bayle asked how could this be, “for what
greater cross is there than marriage?” 12</p>
<p>He reviewed Maimbourg’s book in a volume of letters that appeared</p>
<p>In that same year 1682 Bayle issued his first major work, Pensees
diverses sur la comete — miscellaneous thoughts on the comet that had
crossed the sky in December, 1680. All Europe had been frightened by
that star, whose tail of fire seemed to herald the conflagration of the
world. Only if we put ourselves back into the fears of that age — when
Catholic and Protestant</p>
<p>Bayle passed boldly to one of the most difficult problems of history:
Is a natural ethic possible — can a moral code be maintained without the
aid of supernatural belief? Did atheism lead to corrupt morals? If that
were so, said Bayle, one would have to conclude, from the crime,
corruption, and immorality prevalent in Europe, that most Christians are
secret atheists.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 607</p>
<p>Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, and infidels differ in creeds, but not
in deeds. Apparently religious belief — and ideas in general — have
little in- fluenceupon conduct; this flows from desires and passions
usually stronger than beliefs. What influence had the precepts of Christ
upon the European conception of courage and honor? — which praised most
the man who promptly and violently avenged insults and injuries, who
excelled in war, inventing an infinity of machines to make sieges more
murderous and frightful; “it is from us that infidels learn to use
better arms.” 16 Bayle con - cluded that a society of atheists would
have no worse morals than a society of Christians. What keeps most of us
in order is not the distant and un- certain terror of hell so much as
the fear of the policeman and the law, of social condemnation and
disgrace, of the hangman; take away these secular deterrents, and you
would have chaos; keep them, and a society of atheists would be
possible; indeed, it might contain many men of high honor, and women of
chastity. 17 We hear of such exemplary atheists in antiquity, like
Epicurus and both Plinys; and in modem times, like Michel de l’ Hopital
and Spinoza. (Whether the morals of the average man would be worse than
they are if religion did not supplement law is a question that Bayle
leaves untouched.)</p>
<p>This tract on the comet was published anonymously. Bayle took the
same precaution when he inaugurated one of the major periodicals of the
time, Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres. Its first number, running
to 104 pages, appeared in Amsterdam in March, 1684. The magazine
proposed to keep its readers informed on all significant developments in
literature, science, philosophy, scholarship, exploration, and
historiography. So far as we know, Bayle himself wrote all the contents,
month after month for three years; we may imagine the industry this
entailed. His reviews of books soon became a power in the literary
world. In 1685 he took courage, and acknowledged his authorship. Two
years later his health broke down, and he surrendered the editorship to
other hands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the persecution of Huguenots in France found four victims
in Bayle’s family. As a direct or indirect result of the dragonnades his
mother died in 1681, his father in 1685; in that year his brother was
imprisoned, and died of the cruelties inflicted upon him. Six days later
(October 18) the Edict of Nantes was revoked. Bayle was shocked by these
developments. Like Voltaire, he had no weapon but his pen. In 1686 he
challenged the persecutors with one of the classics in the literature of
toleration.</p>
<p>He called it Commentaire philosophique sur ces paroles de
Jesus-Christ: Contrains-les d’entrer (Philosophical Commentary on These
Words of Jesus Christ: “ Compel Them to Come In“). The persecutors had
claimed to find a divine warrant for their procedure in the parable told
by Christ of</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>the man who, when the guests whom he had invited to a feast failed to
come, said to his servant, “Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of
the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt,
and the blind. . . . Compel them to come in, that my house may be
filled.” 18 Bayle had no trouble in showing that these words had nothing
to do with compelling unity of religious faith. On the contrary, the
attempts to enforce unity of belief had bloodied half of Europe, and the
diversity of religions in a state prevented any one creed from being
strong enough to persecute. Besides, which of us can be so sure that he
has the truth as to warrant injuring another for differing from him?
Bayle condemned persecution by Prot- estants as well as by Catholics,
and of non-Christians by Christians in general. Unlike Locke, he
proposed to extend freedom of worship or non- worship to Jews,
Mohammedans, and freethinkers. Forgetting his claim that atheists were
as likely as Christians to be good citizens, he advised against
tolerating sects that had no belief in Providence and a punishing deity;
these, undeterred from perjury by fear of God, would make difficult the
en- forcement of the law. 19 For the rest, only intolerance should be
exempt from toleration. Should a Protestant state tolerate the rise of a
Catholicism that defended intolerance on the ground that it alone had
the true faith? Bayle thought that in such cases Catholics “should be
deprived of the power of doing mischief. … Yet I should never be for
leaving them exposed to personal insult, or for disturbing their
enjoyment of property or the exercise of their religion, or allow any
injustice in their appeals to law.” 20</p>
<p>The Protestants were no better pleased than the Catholics by this</p>
<p>program of toleration. Pierre Jurieu, who had been Bayle’s friend and
pro - fessorial associate in Sedan, and was now pastor of a Calvinist
congregation in Rotterdam, attacked Bayle in a tract on The Rights of
the Two</p>
<p>Sovereigns in the Matter of Religion — the Conscience and the Prince
(1687). Jurieu proposed “to destroy the dogma of the indifference of
religions, and of universal tolerance, against a book entitled A
Philosophical Commentary .” He agreed with the popes that rulers had
full right to destroy a false religion; and he was especially shocked by
the idea of tolerating Jews, Mohammedans, Socinians, and pagans. In 1691
Jurieu appealed to the burgomasters of Rotterdam to dismiss Bayle from
his professorship. They refused; but in 1693 an election changed the
official personnel; Jurieu renewed his campaign, charging Bayle with
atheism, and Bayle was dismissed. “God preserve us from the Protestant
Inquisition,” said the philosopher; “another five or six years, and it
will have become so terrible that people will be longing to have the
Roman back again.” 21</p>
<p>Soon recovering his perspective and good humor, Bayle adjusted him-
self to the situation. It was sufficient consolation that now he could
devote all his working hours to the epochal Dictionnaire that he had
already begun.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 6 09</p>
<p>He accustomed himself to live on his savings, and a few honorariums
from his publishers. He received offers of patronage from the French
ambassador in Holland, and from three English earls; he courteously
declined, and even refused the Earl of Shrewsbur y’s proffered gift of
two hundred guineas for the dedication of the Dictionary. He had
friends, but few distractions. “Public amusements, games, country jaunts
. . . and other recreations . . . were none of my business. I waste no
time on them, nor in any domestic cares, never soliciting for any
preferment. … I find sweetness and repose in the studies in which I have
engaged myself, and which are my delight. . . . Canem mihi et Musis — I
will sing to myself and the Muses.” 22</p>
<p>So he remained quietly in his room, working fourteen hours a day,</p>
<p>adding page after page to the strange volumes that were to become a
fountainhead of the Enlightenment. The two massive folios, totaling
2,600 pages, appeared at Rotterdam in 1697. He called them Dictionnaire
historique et critique; not a vocabulary of words, but a critical
considera- tion of persons, places, and ideas in history, geography,
mythology,</p>
<p>theology, morals, literature, and philosophy. “Iacta est alea!” he
cried as he dispatched the final proof sheets to the printer — “The die
is cast!” It was a heavy gamble with life and liberty, for it contained
more heresies than any other book of its century, perhaps more than its
grandchild, the Ency elope die (1751) of Diderot and d’Alembert.</p>
<p>Bayle had begun with the limited aim of correcting the errors and</p>
<p>supplying the omissions in the Grand Dictionnaire historique that
Louis Moreri had published in 1674 from the viewpoint of Catholic
orthodoxy; but his aim widened as he progressed. He never pretended to
encyclopedic coverage; where he had nothing to say he said nothing; so
there were no articles on Cicero, Bacon, Montaigne, Galileo, Horace,
Nero, Thomas More. Science and art were largely ignored; on the other
hand, there were articles on such recondite notables as Akiba, Uriel
Acosta, and Isaac Abrabanel. Space was allotted not according to
historical importance but according to Bayle’s interest; so Erasmus, who
had been allotted one page in Moreri, received fifteen in Bayle, and
Abelard eighteen. The arrangement was alphabetical but semi-Talmudic:
the main facts were stated in the text, but in many cases Bayle appended
in smaller type a note in which he let himself go into “a miscellany of
proofs and discussions . . . , even sometimes a train of philosophical
reflections.” It was in this fine print that he draped</p>
<p>6lO THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>in-cheek professions of Calvinist orthodoxy. The original issue of
one thousand copies was sold out in four months.</p>
<p>Bayle’s method was to collate authorities, ferret out the facts,
expound rival and contradictory opinions, follow reason to its
conclusions, and then, if these wounded orthodoxy, reject them piously
in favor of Scripture and faith. Jurieu angrily asked, “Can a word in
passing in favor of faith over reason oblige men to renounce the
objections that Bayle has called in- vincible ?” 23 Otherwise there is
little order in his Dictionnaire. Some of its major discussions emerge
under trivial topics or mislea ding heads. “I cannot meditate with much
regularity on one subject; I am too fond of change. I often wander from
the subject, and jump into places of which it might be difficult to
guess the way out .” 24 Usually the argument was courteous, modest,
undogmatic, and good-humored; now and then, how- ever, Bayle sharpened
his tongue, and the article on St. Augustine did not spare the great
Calvinist for his long deferment of chastity, his gloomy theology, and
his religious intolerance. Bayle professed to accept the Bible as the
Word of God, but he slyly pointed out that we would never believe some
of its miracle stories had they not had so distinguished an author. He
put pagan legends — e.g., Hercules swallowed by a whale — beside similar
tales in the Bible, and let the reader puzzle why one story should be
re- jected and the other received. In the most famous of his articles
he</p>
<p>recounted the massacres, treacheries, and adulteries of King David,
and left the reader to wonder why such a crowned scoundrel should be</p>
<p>honored by Christians as the ancestor of Christ.</p>
<p>He found it easier to swallow both Jonah and the whale than the fall
of Eve and Adam. How could an omnipotent deity create them, foreseeing
that they would taint the whole human race with “original sin” and curse
it with a million miseries?</p>
<p>If man is the creature of one principle perfectly good, most holy and
omnipotent, can he be exposed to diseases, to heat and cold, hunger and
thirst, pain and grief? Can he have so many bad inclinations? Can he
commit so many crimes? Can perfect holiness produce a criminal creature?
Can perfect goodness produce an unhappy creature? Would not omnipotence,
joined with infinite goodness, furnish his own work plentifully with
good things, and secure it from everything that might be offensive or
vexatious ? 25</p>
<p>The God of Genesis was either a cruel deity or one of limited power.
So Bayle expounded with much sympathy and force the Manichean concep-
tion of two gods, one good, the other evil, fighting to control the
world and man. As “the Papists and the Protestants agree that very few
people</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 6ll</p>
<p>escape damnation,” it would seem that the Devil is w inning the
battle against Christ; moreover, his victories are everlasting, for, the
theologians assure us, there is no escape from hell. Since there is, or
will be, more souls in hell than in heaven, and those in hell “eternally
curse the name of God, there will be more creatures who will hate God
than those who will love him.” Bayle maliciously concluded that “we must
not engage with the Manicheans until we have first laid down the
doctrine of the exaltation of faith and the abasing of reason.” 26</p>
<p>The article on Pyrrho expressed doubts about the Trinity, for “things
which do not differ from a third do not differ from each other.” 27 And
as to transubstantiation, “the modes of a substance” — and therefore the
ap- pearances of bread and wine — “cannot subsist without the substance
which they modify.” 28 As to all men inheriting the guilt of Adam and
Eve: “A creature which does not exist cannot be an accomplice of an ill
action.” 29 But all these doubts were placed by him in other mouths than
his own, and were repudiated by him in the name of faith. Bayle quoted
as “most falsely said by impious men” that “religion is a mere human
invention, set up by sovereigns to keep their subjects within the bounds
of obedien ce.” 30 In the article on Spinoza he went out of his way to
condemn the Jewish pantheist as an atheist; yet he must have found
something fascinating in him, for this is the longest article in the
Dictionary. Bayle pretended to reassure the theologians by telling them
that the doubts expressed in his book would never destroy religion —
because these matters were beyond the understanding of the people.
31</p>
<p>Faguet thought Bayle “unquestionably an atheist,” 32 but it would be
fairer to call him a skeptic, and to remember that he was skeptical of
skepticism too. Since secondary sense qualities are largely subjective,
the objective world is quite different from what it appears to us. “The
absolute nature of things is unknown to us; we know only some relations
they have one to another.” 33 Amid 2,600 pages of reasoning he confessed
the weakness of reason; it too, like the senses upon which it depends,
may deceive us, for it is often clouded by passion, and it is desire and
passion, rather than reason, that determine our conduct. Reason can
teach us to doubt, but it rarely moves us to act.</p>
<p>The reasons for doubting are doubtful themselves; one must there-
fore doubt whether he ought to doubt. What chaos! What torment</p>
<p>for the mind! . . . Our reason is the way to wander, since, when it
dis- plays itself with the greatest subtlety, it throws us into such an
abyss.</p>
<p>. . . Human reason is a principle of destruction and not of
edification; it is only fit to start doubts, and to turn itself all
manner of ways to</p>
<p>perpetuate a dispute. 34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Consequently Bayle counseled philosophers not to set a high value on
philosophy, and he advised reformers not to expect much of reforms.
Since human nature is apparently the same in all centuries, it will
continue, through greed, pugnacity, and erotic appetite, to produce the
problems that disorder societies and cause the infantile mortality of
utopias. Men do not learn from history; every generation shows the same
passions, delusions, and crimes. Therefore democracy is all the more a
mistake in proportion as it is real: to allow the busy, ill-informed,
and impulsive multitude to choose rulers and policies would be the
suicide of a state. Some kind of monarchy is necessary, even under
democratic forms. 35 Progress too is a delusion; we mistake movement for
advance, but probably it is merely oscillation. 86 The best we can hope
for is a government that, though manned by corrupt and imperfect men,
will provide enough law and order to enable us to cultivate our gardens
in security, and pursue our studies or hobbies in peace.</p>
<p>No such peace was left to Bayle in the nine years that remained to
him. As his readers passed from his large to his fine print, a wave of
resentment rose. The consistory of the Walloon church in Rotterdam
summoned Bayle — a member of die congregation — to appear before it and
answer charges that his Dictionary contained “indecent expressions and
questions , a great many obscene quotations,” offensive remarks on
atheism and Epicurus, and especially objectionable articles on David,
Pyrrho, and the Manichees. Bayle promised that he “would meditate
further on the doctrine of the Mani - chees,” and if he “fou nd any
replies, or if the ministers of the consistory would furnish him with
some,” he “would be glad to put them in the best form possible.” 37 For
the second edition of the Dictionary (1702) he rewrote and softened the
article on David. Jurieu, unmollified, renewed the assault, and
published in 1706 a blast entitled The Philosopher of Rotterdam Accused,
Attacked, and Convicted.</p>
<p>After that second edition Bayle’s health failed. Like Spinoza, he
suffered from tuberculosis. In these later years he coughed almost
constantly, fell into repeated fevers, and grew despondent with
headaches. Convinced that his disease was incurable, he resigned himself
to death, retired more and more to the confinement of his room, and
worked day and night on the reply that he was making to his critics. On
December 27, 1706, he sent his final sheets to the printer. The next
morning his friends found him dead in his bed.</p>
<p>His influence pervaded the eighteenth century. His Dictionary,
re-</p>
<p>peatedly reissued, became a secret delight to thousands of rebel
minds. By 1750 nine editions had appeared in French, three in English,
one in German. In Rotterdam his admirers wished to raise a statue to him
alongside that of Erasmus, 88 and they induced the publishers to reprint
the original article on David. Within a decade of his death students
stood in line at the Mazarin</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 613</p>
<p>Library in Paris, waiting their turn to read the Dictionnaire . 39 A
survey of private libraries in France found it in more of them than any
other work. 40 Almost every thinker of consequence felt his influence.
Most of Leibniz’ Theodicy was explicitly an attempt to answer Bayle.
Lessing’s mental emancipation, and his defense of tolerance, stemmed
from Bayle. Frederick the Great probably derived his skepticism
originally from Bayle rather than from Voltaire; he called the
Dictionary “the breviary of good sense,” 41 had four sets of it in his
library, and supervised the publication of a cheaper and abbreviated
two-volume edition to attract a wider range of readers. 42 Shaftesbury
and Locke were touched by Bayle more lightly; both of them knew him in
Holland, and Locke’s Epistola de Toler antia (1689) walked in the
footsteps of Bayle’s Commentaire (1686).</p>
<p>But of course the greatest influence of Bayle was on the philosophes
of the Enlightenment; they were weaned on the Dictionnaire. It was
probably from Bayle that Montesquieu and Voltaire took the device of
invoking Asiatic comparisons and criticisms of European institutions.
The En- cyclopedic of 1751 was not, as Faguet judged, “merely a revised,
corrected,</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>fontenelle: 1657-1757</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first forty of his hundred years Bernard Le Bovier de
Fontenelle waged the philosophic war, independently of Bayle, sometimes
before him; and he continued the war, un poco adagio , for half a
century after Bayle’s</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>614</p>
<p>death. He was one of the phenomena of longevity, bridging the gap
between Bossuet and Diderot, and carrying into the intellectual turmoil
of the eighteenth century the milder and more cautious skepticism of
the</p>
<p>seventeenth.</p>
<p>He was bom at Rouen February 11, 1657, so frail that he was baptized
at once in fear that he would die before the day was out. He remained
frail through all his circuit; his lungs were bad, and he spat blood if
he exerted himself even to play billiards; but by measuring out his
forces sparingly, avoiding marriage, starving his passions and indulging
his sleep, he outlived all his contemporaries, and remembered Moliere
while he spoke to Voltaire.</p>
<p>He had some impetus to letters as the nephew of Corneille. He too</p>
<p>dreamed dramas, but the plays and operas that he composed, his
eclogues, love poems, and bergeries lacked passion, and died of the
cold. French literature was losing art and gaining ideas, and Fontenelle
found himself only when he discovered that science could be a more
astonishing revelation than the Apocalypse, and that philosophy was a
ruthful battle transcending all wars. Not that he was a warrior; he was
too genial for strife, too much a man of the world to lose his temper in
debate, and too conscious of the relativity of truth to tie his thought
to an absolute. And yet he “sowed dragon’s teeth.” 48 Where he walked in
feigned discourse with his imaginary Marquise, the army of the
Enlightenment would rise with the dashing light horse of Voltaire, the
heavy i nfantry of d’Holbach, the sappers of the Ency elope die, and the
artillery of Diderot.</p>
<p>His first sally into philosophy was a fifteen- page essay, L’Origine
des fables, in effect a sociological inquiry into the origin of gods. We
can hardly believe his biographer that this was composed at the age of
twenty- three, though prudently left in manuscript till the censorship
was relaxed in 1724. It is almost completely “modem” in spirit, tracing
myths not to priestly invention but to primitive imagination — above
all, to the readiness of simple minds to personify processes. So a river
flowed because a god poured out its water; all natural operations were
the actions of deities.</p>
<p>Men beheld many wonders beyond their own power: to hurl</p>
<p>thunderbolts, raise the winds and the waves . . . Men imagined beings
more powerful than themselves, capable of producing these effects. These
superior beings had to have human form, for what other form could be
imagined? … So the gods were human, but endowed with</p>
<p>superior power. . . . Primitive men could conceive no quality
more</p>
<p>admirable than physical force; they had not yet conceived, had
not</p>
<p>yet words for, wisdom and justice. 49</p>
<p>Half a century before Rousseau, Fontenelle rejected Rousseau’s
idealiza - tion of the savage; primitive men were stupid and barbarous.
But, he added.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH ANI&gt; REASON IN FRANCE 615</p>
<p>“All men are so much alike that there is no race whose follies should
not make us tremble.” 50 He took care to add that his naturalistic
interpretation</p>
<p>Putting that little essay aside for safer times, Fontenelle took a
leaf and a title from Lucian, and published in January, 1683, a little
book called Dialogues des morts. These imaginary conversations between
dead ce- lebrities proved so popular that a second edition was called
for in March, and a third soon afterward. Bayle praised it
enthusiastically in his Nouvelles. Before the year ran out it was
translated into Italian and English, and Fontenelle, at twenty-six,
reached European fame. The dialogue form was handy in a world infested
with censors; almost any notion could be expressed by one of the
speakers, “refuted” by another, and disclaimed by the author.
Fontenelle, however, was in a mood for humor rather than heresy; the
ideas he discussed were moderate, and left no miters crushed. So Milo,
the vegetarian athlete of Crotona, plumes himself with having carried an
ox on his shoulders at the Olympic games; Smindiride, from neighboring
Sybaris, taunts him with developing his muscles at the ex- pense of his
mind; but the sybarite confesses that the epicurean life is also vain,
since it dulls pleasure with frequency, and multiplies the sources and
degrees of pain. Homer compliments Aesop on teaching truth with fables,
but warns him that truth is the last thing desired by mankind. “The
spirit of man is extremely sympathetic to falsehood. . . . Truth must
borrow the figure of the false to be agreeably received by the human
mind.” 51 “If,” said Fontenelle, “I had all truth in my hands, I would
be careful not to open them”; 52 but probably that would be out of
sympathy for mankind, as well as from reckless love of the pursuit.</p>
<p>In the most delightful of the Dialogues Montaigne meets Socrates,
doubt- less in hell, and discusses the idea of progress:</p>
<p>Montaigne. Is this you, divine Socrates? What a joy it is to see
you!</p>
<p>I’ve just entered this region, and ever since I’ve been looking
for</p>
<p>you. At last, after filling my book with your name and praise, I</p>
<p>can talk with you.</p>
<p>socrates. I am happy to see a dead man who appears to have been a
philosopher. But since you have come so recently from up there</p>
<p>… let me ask you the news. How goes the world? Hasn’t it</p>
<p>changed a great deal?</p>
<p>Montaigne. Much indeed. You wouldn’t recognize it.</p>
<p>socrates. I am delighted to hear it. I have never doubted that it
must become better or wiser than in my time.</p>
<p>Montaigne. What are you saying? It is crazier and more corrupt</p>
<p>than ever. That is the change I wanted to discuss with you; and I</p>
<p>have been waiting to hear from you an account of the age in</p>
<p>6i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>which you lived, and in which so much honesty and justice</p>
<p>reigned.</p>
<p>socrates. And I, on the contrary, have been waiting to learn
about</p>
<p>the marvels of the age in which you have just lived. What? Men</p>
<p>have not yet corrected the follies of antiquity? … I hoped that</p>
<p>things would take a turn toward reason, and that men would</p>
<p>profit from the experience of so many years.</p>
<p>montaigne. Eh? Men profit from experience? They are like birds</p>
<p>that repeatedly let themselves be caught in the same nets that</p>
<p>have already taken a hundred thousand birds of the same species.</p>
<p>Everyone enters new into life, and the mistakes of the parents</p>
<p>are lost on the children. . . . Men of all centuries have the
same</p>
<p>inclinations, over which reason has no power. Hence, wherever</p>
<p>there are men there are follies, even the same follies. . . .</p>
<p>socrates. You idealized antiquity because you were angry at your own
time. . . . When we were alive we esteemed our ancestors more</p>
<p>than they deserved, and now our posterity exalts us beyond our</p>
<p>merits: but our ancestors, ourselves, and our posterity are quite</p>
<p>equal. . . .</p>
<p>montaigne. But aren’t some ages more virtuous, and others more</p>
<p>wicked?</p>
<p>socrates. Not necessarily. Clothes change, but that is not to say
that the figure of the body changes, too. Politeness or grossness,
knowl- edge or ignorance, … are but the outside of man, and all that</p>
<p>changes; but the heart changes not at all; and all of man is in
the</p>
<p>heart. . . . Among the vast multitude of foolish men born in a</p>
<p>hundred years, nature may have scattered here and there . . .</p>
<p>two or three dozen reasonable men. 63</p>
<p>Some years after this pessimistic conclusion, Fontenelle took a
slightly more optimistic view in a Digression sur les Anciens et les
Modernes (January, 1688). There he drew a helpful distinction: in poetry
and art there had been no visible progress, for these depend upon
feeling and imagination, which hardly change from generation to
generation; but in science and learning, which depend upon the slow
accumulation of knowl- edge, we may expect to surpass antiquity. Each
nation, Fontenelle sug- gested, goes through stages like an individual:
in infancy it devotes itself to meeting its physical wants; in youth it
adds imagination, poetry, and art; in maturity it may reach science and
philosophy. 54 Fontenelle thought that he saw truths growing through the
gradual elimination of erroneous views. “We are under an obligation to
the ancients for having exhausted almost all the false theories that
could be formed” — which is to forget that for every truth there is an
indefinite number of possible errors. He sup-</p>
<p>FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>617</p>
<p>posed that Descartes had found a new and better mode of reasoning —
the mathematical; now, he hoped, science would grow by leaps.</p>
<p>When we behold the progress the sciences have made during the</p>
<p>last hundred years, in spite of prejudices, obstacles, and the
small</p>
<p>number of scientific men, we might almost be tempted to let our</p>
<p>hopes for the future rise too high. We shall see new sciences
springing out of nothingness, while ours are still in the cradle. 68</p>
<p>So Fontenelle formulated a theory of progress, le progrks des choses;
and, like Condorcet a century later, he conceived it as having no
assignable limit in the future; here already was the “indefinite
perfectibility of man - kind.” The idea of progress was now fully
launched, and sailed on through the eighteenth century to become one of
the fairest vehicles of modern thought.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fontenelle, whose brilliant fancy was ever straining at
the leash of caution, had come close to the Bastille. About 1685 he
published a brief Relation de Pile de Borneo , an imaginary voyage so
realistically de- scribed (anticipating the verisimilitude of Defoe and
Swift) that Bayle printed it as an actual history in his Nouvelles. But
the conflict which it described between Eenegu and Mreo was an evident
satire on the theologi- cal strife between Geneva and Rome. When the
French authorities saw through the anagrams, the arrest of Fontenelle
seemed inevitable, for the skit appeared on the very heels of the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He hurriedly issued a poem lauding
“the Triumph of Religion under Louis the Great.” His apology was
accepted, and thereafter Fontenelle saw to it that his philosophy should
be unintelligible to governments.</p>
<p>He returned to science, and made himself its missionary to French</p>
<p>society. He was too fond of ease to engage directly in experiment or
re- search, but he understood the sciences well, and presented them to
his growing audiences in small doses coated with literary art. To
popularize the Copemican astronomy he composed Entretiens sur la
pluralite des mondes (1686) — Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds.
Though 143 years had passed since the appearance of Copernicus’ De
revolutionibus orbium coelestium, very few people in France, even among
college gradu- ates, accepted the heliocentric theory. Galileo had been
condemned by the Church (1633) for assuming that the hypothesis was a
fact; and Descartes had not dared to publish his treatise Le Monde, in
which the Copemican view had been taken for granted.</p>
<p>Fontenelle approached the subject with disarming gallantry. He
imagined himself discussing it with a pretty marquise; her figure —
unseen but not unfelt — moved through the discourse alluringly; for when
beauty has a</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>tide it can dim the stars. The six “conversations” were soirs,
“evenings”; the scene was the garden of the marquise’s chateau near Ro
uen. The pur- pose was to get the people of France — or at least the
ladies of the</p>
<p>salons — to understand the rotation and revolution of the earth, and
the Cartesian theory of vortices. As an added lure, Fontenelle raised
the ques- tion whether the moon and the planets are inhabited. He was
inclined to think so; but, remembering that some readers might be
disturbed by the notion that there were in the world men and women not
descended from Adam and Eve, he prudently explained that these lunar or
planetary popu- lations were not really human. However, he suggested
that they might have other senses, perhaps finer senses, than ours; if
so, they would see objects differently than we do; would truth, then, be
relative? This would upset everything, even more than Copernicus had
done. Fontenelle saved the situation by pointing out the beauty and
order of the cosmos, com- paring it to a watch, and deducing from the
cosmic mechanisms a divine artificer of supreme intelligence.</p>
<p>As the desire to teach is among our strongest itches, Fontenelle
again risked the Bastille by issuing anonymously, in December, 1688, the
boldest of his little treatises, UHistoire des oracles. He confessed to
having taken his material from the De Oraculis of a Dutch scholar, van
Dael; but he transformed it by the clarity and gaiety of his style. “//
nous enjole a la verite,” said a reader — “He cajoles us to the truth.”
So he compared mathe - maticians with lovers: “Grant a mathematician the
least princi ple, and he will draw from it a consequence which you must
also grant him, and from this consequence another . . .” 56 Theologians
had accepted some pagan oracles as authentic, but had ascribed their
occasional accuracy to Satanic inspiration; and they had held it a proof
of the Church’s divine origin that these oracles had ceased to operate
after the coming of Christ. But Fon- tenelle showed that they had
continued as late as the fifth century a.d. He exonerated Satan as their
deus ex machine; the oracles were tricks of pagan priests moving in the
temples to work apparent miracles, or to appropriate the food offered by
worshipers to the gods. He pretended that he spoke only of pagan
oracles, and explicitly excepted Christian oracles and priests from his
analysis. This essay, and the Origine des fables, were not only subtle
blows struck for enlightenment; they were examples of a new historical
approach to theological questions — to explain the human sources of
transmundane beliefs, and thereby naturalize the supernatural.</p>
<p>UHistoire des oracles was the last of Fontenelle’s sapping
operations. In 1691 he was elected to the French Academy, over the
opposition of Racine and Boileau. In 1697 he became, and for forty-two
years he re- mained, “perpetual secretary” of the Academie des Sciences.
He wrote its history, and composed gracious and illuminating eloges of
members who</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) FAITH AND REASON IN FRANCE 619</p>
<p>had died; these constitute a lucid record and exposition of French
science through almost half a century. From such seances of the sciences
Fontenelle could pass with equal pleasure to the salons — first that of
Mme. de Lambert, then Mme. de Tencin’s, then Mme. Geoffrin’s. He was
always welcomed, not merely because of his fame as a writer, but because
his courtesy never lapsed. He dispensed truth with discretion, he
refused to sour conversation with controversy, and his wit had no sting.
“No man of his time was more open- minded and free from prejudice.” 57
Mme. de Tencin, who had been a firefly of passion, foolishly accused him
of having another brain where his heart should have been. 58 And the
young God-killers who were grow- ing up around him could no more
understand his moderation than he could relish their dogmatism and
violence. “Je suis effraye de la conviction qui regne autour de moi’ ’
(I am frightened by the certainties that reign around me). 59 He did not
see an unmixed evil in the decay of his hearing as he grew old.</p>
<p>About the age of fifty he apparently decided to give thereafter none
but platonic services to the ladies. But his gallantry never faltered.
At ninety, being introduced to a young and pretty woman, he remarked,
“Ah, if I were only eighty now!” 60 Nearly ninety -eight, he opened a
New Year’s ball by dancing with the one -and-a-half-y ear-old daughter
of Helvetius. 61 When Mme. Grimaud, almost as old as he, said,
wonderingly, “Well, here we are, both still alive,” he put a finger to
his lips, and</p>
<p>whispered, “Hush, madame, death has forgotten us.” 62</p>
<p>It found him at last, January 9, 1757, and took him quietly, after he
had been ill but a day. He explained to his friends that he was
“suffering from being” (“Je souffre d’etre”) -, he may have felt that he
had carried longevity to excess. He fell short by thirty-three days of
rounding out a century. He had been bom before Louis XIV had begun to
govern; he had grown up amid the triumphs of Bossuet, the Revocation,
and the dragonnades; he had lived to see the Ency elope die, and to hear
Voltaire summon the philoso- phers to war upon I’infame.</p>
