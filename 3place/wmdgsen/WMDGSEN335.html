Literature in the Age of Rabelais</h4>
<p>1517-64</p>
<p>I. OF MAKING BOOKS</p>
<p>A FTER Gutenberg the impulse to self-display took an added form — the
itch. to be in print. It was a costly urge, for the only copyright then
known was the “exclusive privilege” given by civil or ecclesiastical
authorities to print a speci - fied book. Such a grant was exceptional,
and without it rival publishers, even in the same country, might
“pirate” a work at will. If a book sold well the publisher would usually
give the author an honorarium; but almost the only publications
profitable enough to earn such a fee were popular romances, tales of
magic or marvels, and controversial pamphlets which had to be abusive to
sell. Works of scholarship were lucky to pay their cost. Publishers
encouraged authors to dedi- cate such productions to state or Church
dignitaries, or affluent magnates or lords, in the hope of a gift for
the laud.</p>
<p>Printing and publishing were generally united in the same firm, and
the man or family that engaged in them was a vital factor in his town
and times. Fame through printing alone was rare. Claude Garamond of
Paris managed it by discarding the “Gothic” typ e that German printers
had adopted from manu- script lettering, and designing ( c. 1540) a
“roman” type based on the Carolongian</p>
<p>Germany led the world in publishing. There were active firms in
Basel, Stras- bourg, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Wittenberg, Cologne, Leipzig,
Frankfurt, and Magdeburg. Twice a year publishers and booksellers met at
the Frankfurt fair, bought and sold books, and exchanged ideas. One
Frankfurt printer issued the first newspaper ( 1 548) — a sheet
distributed at the fair and reporting recent events. Antwerp became a
publishing center when Christopher Plantin turned his bindery into a
printing shop (1 555); two years later he sent 1,200 volumes to the
Frankfurt fair. In France the hub of the book trade was Lyons; 200
printing establishments made the city challenge Paris as the
intellectual capital of the land.</p>
<p>Etienne Dolet, printer and humanist, was the firebrand of Lyons. Born
in Orleans, schooled in Paris, he fell in love with Cicero; “I approve
only of Christ</p>
<p>784</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 785</p>
<p>here, and exchanged irreverent epigrams with skeptical Averroists. At
Toulouse he became the soul of a freethinking band that laughed at
“Papists” and Lutherans alike. Banished, he went to Lyons and made a
name for himself with poems and articles, but he killed a painter in an
argument, and fled to Paris, where Margue- rite of Navarre won him a
pardon from the King. He became friends — and quarreled — with Marot and
Rabelais. Returning to Lyons, he set up a printing press, and
specialized in publishing heretical works. The Inquisition summoned him,
tried him, imprisoned him; he escaped, but was captured on a clandestine
visit to his son. On August 3, 1546, he was burned alive.</p>
<p>The most distinguished of French publishers were the Etiennes, a
dynasty as persistent in printing as the Fuggers in finance. Henri
Etienne started his press at Paris about 1500; it was continued by his
sons Francis, Robert, and Charles; to these four France owed her finest
editions of the Greek and Latin classics. Robert compiled a Thesaurus
linguae latinae (1532), which became the leaning- post for all later
Latin-French dictionaries. To the Etiennes Latin became a second tongue;
they regularly spoke it in their family life. Francis I praised their
work, supported Marguerite in defending them against the Sorbonne, and
on one occasion joined the cot erie of scholars that met in Robert’s
shop; a famous story tells how the King waited patiently while Robert
corrected an urgent proof. Francis provided the funds with which Robert
engaged Garamond to design and cast a new font of Greek type, so
beautiful that it became the model of most later printing in Greek. The
Sorbonne disapproved of the King’s flirta - tion with Hellenism; a
professor warned Parlement (1539) that “to propagate</p>
<p>Many publications of this age were models of typography, engraving,
and binding. The heavy half-metallic bindings of the fifteenth century
gave place to lighter and cheaper covers in leather, velum, or
parchment. Jean Grolier de Servieres, treasurer of France in 1534, had
most of his 3,000 volumes so elegantly bound in Levantine morocco that
they rank among the handsomest books in existence. Private libraries
were now numberless, and public libraries were opened in many cities —
Cracow (1517), Hamburg (1529), Nuremberg (1538)…. Under Francis I the
old royal library assembled by Charles VIII was trans- ferred from the
Louvre to Fontainebleau, and was enriched with new collections</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>and fine bindings; this Bibliotheque du Roi became, after the
Revolution, the Bibliotheque Nationale. Many monastic libraries perished
in the Reformation, but many passed into private hands, and what was of
value in them found its way into public repositories. Much is lost in
history, but so much of worth has been preserved that not a hundred
lifetimes could absorb it.</p>

<li>SCHOOLS</li>
</ol>
<p>It was natural that the Revolution should for a time disrupt the
educational system of Western Europe, for that system was almost wholly
a service of the Church, and the influence of the orthodox clergy could
not be successfully challenged without breaking their control of
education. Luther condemned the existing grammar schools as teaching the
student “only enough bad Latin to become a priest and read Mass… and yet
remain all his life a poor ignoramus fit neither to cackle nor to lay
eggs.” 2 As for the universities, they seemed to him dens of murderers,
temples of Moloch, synagogues of corruption; “nothing mor e hellish…
ever appeared on earth… or ever would appear”; and he concluded that
they were “only worthy of being reduced to dust.” 8 Melanch - thon
agreed with him on the ground that the universities were turning
students into pagans. 4 The opinio n of Carlstadt, the Zwickau
“prophets,” and the Anabap - tists — that education was a useless frill,
a peril to morals, and a hindrance to salvation — was readily accepted
by parents who grudged the cost of educating their children. Some
fathers argued that since secondary instruction was largely directed to
preparing students for the priesthood, and priests were now so un-
fashionable, it was illogical to send sons to universities.</p>
<p>The Reformers had expected that the revenues of ecclesiastical
properties appropriated by the state would in part be devoted to
establishing new schools to replace those that were disappearing with
the closing of the monasteries; but “princes and lords,” Luther
complained, “were so bu sily engaged in the high and important affairs
of the cellar, the kitchen, and the bedchamber that they had no time” to
help education. “In the German provinces,” he wrote (1524), “the schools
are now everywhere allowed to go to ruin.” 5 By 1530 he and Melanchthon
were lamenting the deterioration of the German universities. 6 At Erfurt
the enrollment fell from 311 in 1520 to 120 in 1521, to 34 in 1524; at
Rostock from 300 in 1517 to 15 in 1525; at Heidelberg in that year there
were more professors than students; and in 1526 only five scholars
enrolled at the University of Basel. 7</p>
<p>Luther and Melanchthon labored to repair the damage. In an Epistle to
the Burgomasters (1524) Luther appealed to secular authorities to
establish schools. In 1530, far ahead of his time, he proposed that
elementary education should be made compulsory, and be provided at
public expense. 8 To the universities, gradually reconstituted under
Protestant auspices, he recommended a curriculum centered on the Bible,
but also teaching Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, law, medicine, history,
and “poets and orators… heathen or Christian.” 9 Melanch -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 787</p>
<p>hon made the revival of education a main task of his life. Under his
leadership and stimulus many new schools were opened; by the end of the
sixteenth century there were 300 in Germany. He drew up a Schulplan (
1527) for the organization of schools and universities; he wrote
textbooks of Latin and Greek grammar, of rhetoric, logic, psychology,
ethics, and theology; and he trained thousands of teachers for the new
institutions. His country gratefully named him Praeceptor Germaniae ,
the Educator of Germany. One by one the universities of northern Germany
passed under Protestant control: Wittenberg (1522), Marburg (1527),
Tubingen (1535), Leipzig (1539), Konigsberg (1544), Jena (1558).
Professors or students who (as Duke Ulrich of Wiirttemberg put it ) were
opposed to “the right, true, evangelical doctrine” were dismissed.
Calvinists were excluded from Lutheran colleges, and Protestants were
barred from universities still held by Catholics. Generally, after the
Peace of Augsburg (1555), German students were forbidden to attend
schools of another faith than that of the territorial prince. 10</p>
<p>Johannes Sturm immensely advanced the new education when he set up a
Gymnasium or secondary school at Strasbourg (1538), and published in
that year an influential tract On Rightly Opening Schools of Letters (De
litter arum ludis recte aperiendis). Like so many leaders of thought in
Central Europe, Sturm had received his schooling from the Brethren of
the Common Life. Thence he went to Louvain and Paris, where he met
Rabelais; the famous letter of Gargantua on education may echo a mutual
influence. While making “a wise piety” the chief aim of education, Sturm
laid rising, stress on the study of the Greek and Latin languages and
literatures; and this thoroughness of training in the classics passed
down to the later Gymnasien of Germany to raise the army of scholars
that in the nineteenth century raided and ransacked the ancient
world.</p>
<p>The schools of England suffered even more than those of Germany from
the religious overturn. Cathedral, monastic, guild, and chantry schools
melted away in the heat of the attack upon ecclesiastical abuses and
wealth. Most university students had been sent up by those schools; this
flow ceasing, Oxford graduated only 173 bachelors of arts, Cambridge
only 19 1, in 1548; in 1547 and 1550 Ox- ford had no such graduates at
all. 11 Henry VIII felt the problem, but his need of funds for war or
weddings limited him to establishing Trinity College, Cambridge (1546),
and financing regius professorships in divinity, Hebrew, Greek,
medicine, and law. Private philanthropy in this period founded Corpus
Christi College, Christ Church College, St. John’s College, and Trinity
College at Oxford, and Magdalen College at Cambridge. The royal
commission sent by Cromwell to Oxford and Cambridge (1535) to
appropriate their charters and endowments for the King brought both
faculty and curriculum under governmental control. The reign of
Scholasticism in England was summarily ended; the works of Duns Scotus
were literally scattered to the winds; 12 canon law was set aside; Greek
and Latin studies were encouraged; the curriculum was largely
secularized. But dogmatism remained. A law of 1553 required all candi-
dates for degrees to subscribe to the Anglican Articles of Religion.</p>
<p>In Catholic France and Flanders the universities declined not in
endowments</p>
<p>788 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>or enrollments but in vigor and freedom of intellectual life. New
universities were opened at Reims, Douai, Lille, and Besanjon. The
University of Louvain rivaled that of Paris in number of students
(5,000), and in defense of an ortho- doxy that even the popes found
extreme. The University of Paris had a large enrollment (6,000), but it
no longer attracted foreign students in any consider- able number, or
tolerated, as in its thirteenth-century prime, the quickening ferment of
new ideas. Its other faculties were so dominated by that of theology —
the Sorbonne — that this name became almost a synonym for the
university. The curriculum of theology and expurgated classics seemed to
Montaigne a superficial routine of memorizing and conformity. Rabelais
never tired of satirizing the scholastic formalities and logical
gymnastics of the Sorbonne, the waste of student years in debates
carefully removed from actual concern with human life. “I am willing to
lose my share of paradise/’ vowed Clement Marot, “if those great
beasts”— the professors — “did not ruin my youth.” 13 All the power and
authority of the university were turned not only against the French
Protestants but against the French humanists as well.</p>
<p>Francis I, who had drunk the wine of Italy, and had met churchmen
steeped in the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, did his best to
protect French scholarship from the conservative discouragements
emanating from the Sor- bonne. Urged on by Guillaume Bude, Cardinal Jean
du Bellay, and the indefati- gable Marguerite, he provided funds to
establish (1529), independently of the university, a school devoted
predominantly to humanistic studies. Four “royal professors” were
initially appointed— two for Greek, two for Hebrew; and chairs of Latin,
mathematics, medicine, and philosophy were presently added. Tuition was
free. 14 This College Royale, later renamed College de France, be- came
the warming hearth of French humanism, the home of the free but disci-
plined mind of France.</p>
<p>Spain, though passionately orthodox, had excellent universities,
fourteen in 1553, including new foundations at Toledo, Santiago, and
Granada; that of Salamanca, with seventy professors and 6,778 students
in 1584, could bear com- parison with any. The universities of Italy
continued to flourish; that of Bologna, in 1 543, had fifty- seven
professors in the faculty of “arts,” thirty -seven in law, fifteen in
medicine; and Padua was the Mecca of enterprising students from north of
the Alps. Poland testified to its golden age by enrolling 15,338
students at one time in the University of Cracow; 15 and in Poznan the
Lubranscianum , founded ( 1 5 19) by Bishop John Lubranski, was
dedicated to humanistic pursuits. All in all, the universities suffered
less in Catholic than in Protestant countries in this cataclysmic
century.</p>
<p>The importance of the teacher was underestimated, and he was
grievously underpaid. The professors at the College Royale received 200
crowns a year (,000?), but this was highly exceptional. At Salamanca the
professors were chosen by the students after a trial period of sample
lectures by rival candidates. Instruction was mostly by lectures,
sometimes brought to life by debates. Note- taking served many a student
in place of textbooks; dictionaries were rare; laboratories were
practically unknown except to alchemists. Students were</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 789</p>
<p>housed in cheap and poorly heated rooms, and became ill on unclean or
in- adequate food. Many worked their way through college. Classes began
at six in the morning, ended at five in the afternoon. Discipline was
rigorous; even near-graduates might be flogged. The students warmed
themselves with street brawls and such wine and wenches as they could
afford. By one means or another they achieved education, to a
degree.</p>
<p>Girls of the lower classes remained illiterate; many of the middle
classes found moderate schooling in nunneries; well-to-do young women
had tutors. Holland boasted of several ladies who could be courted in
Latin, and who could probably conjugate better than they could decline.
In Germany the wife of Peutinger and the sisters and daughters of
Pirkheimer were famous for learning; in France the women around Francis
graced their flirtations with classical quotations; and in England some
bluestockings — More’s daughters, Jane Grey, “Bloody Mary,” Elizabeth —
were paragons of erudition.</p>
<p>Two famous teachers belong to this age. The lesser was Sir Thomas
Elyot, whose Boke Named the Govemour (1531) outlined an education by
which pedigreed pupils might be fitted for statesmanship. Elyot began by
berating the cultural crudity of the English nobles; he contrasted it
with the learning credited to men of affairs in ancient Greece and Rome,
and quoted Diogenes the Cynic, who, “seeing one without learning seated
on a stone, remarked… ‘Behold where one stone sitteth on another.’” 16
At seven the boy should be placed under a carefully selected tutor, who
will teach him the elements of music, painting, and sculpture. At
fourteen he is to be taught cosmography, logic, and history, and is to
be trained in wrestling, hunting, shooting with the longbow, swimming,
and tennis; not football, for that is plebeian, and “therein is nothing
but beastly furie and external violence.” The lad is to study the
classics at every stage of his education — first the poets, then the
orators, then the historians, then the generals, then the philosophers;
to which Elyot, as almost an afterthought, adds the Bible, thereby
reversing Luther’s plan. For, despite his protestations, Elyot much
prefers the classics to the Bible. “Lord God, what incomparable
sweetness of words and matter in the works of Plato and Cicero, wherein
is joined gravity and delectation, excellent wisdom with divine elo-
quence, absolute virtue with pleasure incredible,” so “that those books
be almost sufficient to mak e a perfect and excellent governor!” 17</p>
<p>Juan Vives, humanest of the humanists, followed a larger aim and
wider course. Born at Valencia in 1492, he left Spain at seventeen,
never to see it again. He studied in Paris long enough to love
philosophy and despise Scholasticism. At twenty-six he wrote the first
modern history of philosophy — De initiis , sectis , et laudibus
philosophiae. In the same year he challenged the universities with an
attack on Scholastic methods of teaching philosophy; the scheme of
promoting thought by debates, he felt, promoted only futile wrangling
over inconsequential issues. Erasmus hailed the book, recommended it to
More, and politely feared that “Vives… will overshadow… Erasmus.” 18
Perhaps through Erasmus’ influence Vives was appointed professor of the
humanities at Louvain (1519). Urged on by Erasmus, he published an
edition of Augustine’s City of God with</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>790</p>
<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>elaborate commentaries; he dedicated it to Henry VIII, and received
so cordial a reply that he moved to England (1523). He was welcomed by
More and Queen Catherine, his compatriot, and Henry named him one of
Princess Mary’s tutors. Apparently for her guidance he wrote On the
Education of Children (De ratione studii puerilis, 1523). All went well
until he expressed disapproval of Henry’s plea for a marriage annulment.
Henry stopped his salary, and put him under house arrest for six weeks.
Released, Vives returned to Bruges (1528), and spent there the remaining
years of his life.</p>
<p>Still idealistic at thirty-seven, he dedicated to Charles V an
Erasmian appeal for an international court of arbitration as a
substitute for war (De concordia et discordia in humano genere , 1529).
Two years later he issued his major work, De tradendis disciplinis (On
the Transmission of Studies ), the most progressive educational treatise
of the Renaissance. He called for an education directed “to the
necessities of life, to some bodily or mental improvement, to the
cultivation and increase of reverence.” 19 The pupil should enter school
“as if into a holy temple,” but his studies there should prepare him to
be a decent and useful citizen. Those studies should cover the whole of
life, and should be taught in their interrelation, as they function in
living. Nature, as well as books, should be studied; things are more
instructive than theories. Let the student note the veins, nerves,
bones, and other parts of the body in their anatomy and action; let him
consult farmers, hunters, shepherds, gardeners… and learn their lore;
these gleanings will be more useful than the Scholastic “babblement
which has corrupted every branch of knowledge in the name of logic.” 20
T he classics, expurgated for youth, should remain a vital part of the
curriculum, but modem history and geography are to be studied too. The
vernaculars as well as Latin should be taught, and all by the direct
method of daily use.</p>
<p>Vives was so far ahead of his time that it lost sight of him, and let
him die in poverty. He remained a Catholic to the end.</p>
<p>fll. SCHOLARS</p>
<p>The distinctive task of the universities, the academies, and the
humanists in the Renaissance was to gather, translate, and transmit the
old world of Greece and Rome to the young world of modern Europe. The
task was grandly accom- plished, and the classic revelation was
complete.</p>
<p>Two men remain to be commemorated as oracles of this revelation.
Guillaume Bude, after living sixty-two years in hopes of making Paris
the heir of Italian humanism, came into his own when Francis founded the
College Roy ale. He began his adult studies with law, and for almost a
decade he buried himself in the Pandects of Justinian. To understand
these texts better — Latin in language but Byzantine in bearings — he
took up Greek with John Lascaris, and so devotedly that his teacher,
departing, bequeathed to him his precious library of Greek books. When,
at forty-one, Bude published Annotations in XXIV libros Pandectarum
(1508), the Digest of Justinian, for the first time in Renaissance</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 791</p>
<p>jurisprudence, was studied in itself and its environment, instead of
being dis - placed by t he commentaries of the “glossators.” Six years
later he issued another monument of recondite research, De asse et
partibus — on its surface a discussion of ancient coins and measures,
but actually an exhaustive consideration of classi- cal literature in
relation to economic life. Still more impressive were his Com - mentarii
linguae graecae (1529), a work loosely ordered, but so rich in
lexicographic information and illumination that it placed Bude at the
head of all European Hellenists. Rabelais sent him a letter of homage,
Erasmus paid him the compliment of jealousy. Erasmus was a man of the
world, to whom scholarship was only a part of life; but to Bude
scholarship and life were one. “It is philology,” he wrote, “that has so
long been my companion, my associate, my mistress, bound to me by every
tie of affection…. But I have been forced to loosen the bonds of a love
so devouring… that I found it destructive to my health.” 21 He</p>
<p>Paris had not yet in his time absorbed the intellectual life of
France. Humanism had a dozen French hearths: Bourges, Bordeaux,
Toulouse, Montpellier, and, above all, Lyons, where love and humanism,
ladies and literature, made a delight- ful mixture. And in Agen, where
no one would have looked for an emperor, Julius Caesar Scaliger ruled
imperiously over the philological scene after Bude’s death. Bom probably
at Padua (1484), he came to Agen at forty-one, and lived there till his
death (1558). Every scholar feared him, for he had a masterly com- mand
of vituperative Latin. He made a name for himself by attacking Erasmus
for belittling the “Ciceronians”— sticklers for a precise Ciceronian
Latin. He criticized Rabelais, then criticized Dolet for criticizing
Rabelais. In a volume of Exercitationes he examined Jerome Cardan’s De
subtilitate, and undertook</p>
<p>A special gift of the Greek revival was Amyot’s translation of
Plutarch’s Lives. Jacques Amyot was one of Marguerite’s many prot6g6s;
through her he was appointed to a chair of Greek and Latin at Bourges.
His translations of Daphnis and Chloe and other Greek love stories were
rewarded, in the genial</p>

<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>oddity of the times, with a rich abbey. So secured, he traveled
widely in Italy, indulging his antiquarian and philological tastes. When
he published the hives (1559) he prefaced the book with an eloquent plea
for the study of history as the “treasure house of humanity,” a museum
in which a thousand examples of virtue and vice, statesmanship and
decay, are preserved for the instruction of mankind; like Napoleon, he
considered history a better teacher of philosophy than philosophy
itself. Nevertheless he proceeded to translate also Plutarch’s Moralia.
He was promoted to the bishopric of Auxerre. and died there in the
ripeness of eighty years (1593). His version of the Lives was not alw
ays accurate, but it was a work of literature in its own right, endowed
with a natural and idiomatic style quite equal to that of the original.
Its influence was endless. Montaigne reveled in it, and turned from the
France of St. Bartholomew to this select and ennobled antiquity;
Shakespeare took three plays from North’s virile translation of Amyot’s
translation; the Plutarchian ideal of the hero modeled a hundred French
dramas and revolutionists; and the Vies des hovmies illustres gave to
the nation a pantheon of celebrities fit to stir the more masculine
virtues of the French soul.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE FRENCH RENAISSANCE</li>
</ol>
<p>It is customary and forgivable to call by this term, so rich in
overtones, the period between the accession of Francis I (1515) and the
assassination of Henry IV (1610). Essentially this colorful flowering of
French poetry and prose, manners and arts and dress was less a rebirth
than a ripening. By the patient resilience of men and the new growth of
the new-seeded earth, the French economy and spirit had recovered from
the Hundred Years’ War. Louis XI had given France a strong, centered,
orderly government; Louis XII had given it a fruitful decade of peace.
The free, loose, fantastic creativeness of the Gothic age survived, even
and most in Rabelais, who so admired the classics that he quoted nearly
all of them. But the great awaken- ing was also a renascence. French
literature and art were unquestionably affected by a closer acquaintance
with ancient culture and classic forms. Those forms and the classic
temper — the predominance of intellectual order over emotional ardor —
continued in French drama, poetry, painting, sculp- ture, and
architecture for almost three centuries. The fertilizing agents in the
new birth were the French discovery and invasion of Italy, the French
study of Roman ruins, jurisprudence, and literature, of Italian letters
and arts, and the influx of Italian artists and poets into France. To
the happy issue many other factors contributed: printing; the
dissemination and trans- lation of classic texts; the patronage of
scholars, poets, and artists by French kings, by their mistresses, by
Marguerite of Navarre, by ecclesiastics and aristocrats; and the
inspiration of women capable of appreciating other</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXV) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 793</p>
<p>beauties than their own. All these elements came together in the
flourishing of France.</p>
<p>Francis I, who inherited all this, had as a page the poet who served
as a transition from Gothic to classic, from Villon to Renaissance.
Clement Marot entered history as a frolicsome lad of thirteen who amused
the King with jolly tales and sprightly repartees. Some years later
Francis smiled upon the youth’s adventures and quarrels with “all the
ladies of Paris,” for he agreed with Marot that they were very charming
indeed:</p>
<p>La Frangoise est entire et sans rompeure;</p>
<p>Plaisir la tneine, au profit ne regarde.</p>
<p>Conclusion: qui en parle ou brocarde,</p>
<p>Franpoises sont chef-d’oeuvre de nature —</p>
<p>“The Frenchwoman is flawless and complete; pleasure leads her; she
does not look for profit. To conclude: whatever anyone may say to
ridicule them, Frenchwomen are nature’s masterpiece.” 22</p>
<p>Marot babbled poems like a bubbling spring. They were seldom pro-
found, but often touched with tender sentiment; they were verses of
occa- sion, conversation pieces, ballads, roundels, madrigals, or
satires and epistles reminiscent of Horace or Martial. He noted with
some pique that women (himself to the contrary notwithstanding) could be
more readily persuaded by diamonds than by dithyrambs:</p>
<p>Quant les petites vilotieres</p>
<p>Trouvent quelque hardi amant</p>

<p>In 1519 Marot became valet-de-chambre to Marguerite, and fell in love
with her dutifully; gossip said she returned his moans, but more likely
she gave him nothing but religion. He developed a moderate sympathy with
the Protestant cause in the intervals of his amours. He followed Francis
to Italy, fought like a Bayard at Pavia, had the honor to be captured
with his King, and — no ransom being expected for a poet — was released.
Back in France, he announced his Protestant ideas so openly that the
bishop of Chartres sum- moned him, and kept him under genteel
imprisonment in the episcopal palace. He was set free by Marguerite’s
intercession, but was soon arrested</p>
<p>Presently the affair of the placards revived the campaign against the
French Protestants. News reached Marot that his rooms in Paris had been
searched, and that a warrant had gone out for his arrest (1535). Fearful
that even Marguerite’s skirts would not suffice to hide him, he fled to
Italy, to the Duchess Renee in Ferrara. She welcomed him as if a reborn
Virgil had ar- rived from Mantua; and perhaps she knew that he liked to
link his name with that of Publius Vergilius Maro. He resembled more the
lighthearted, amor- ous Ovid, or his favorite Villon, whose poems he
edited and whose life he relived. When Duke Ercole II let it be known
that he was surfeited with Protestants, Clement moved on to Venice. Word
reached him that Francis had offered pardon to abjuring heretics; Marot,
thinking the ladies of Paris worth a Mass, abjured. The King gave him a
house and garden, and Clement tried to be a bourgeois gentilhomme.</p>
<p>Francois Vatable, who was teaching Hebrew in the College Royale,
asked him to translate the Psalms into French verse, and expounded them
to him word for word. Marot put thirty of them into melodious poetry,
and pub- lished them with a judicious dedication to the King. Francis
liked them so</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 795</p>
<p>much that he gave a special copy to Charles V, who was momentarily
his friend; Charles sent the poet 200 crowns (,000?). Marot translated
more of the Psalms, and issued them in 1543 with a dedication to his
first love, “the ladies of France.” Goudimel put them to music, as we
have seen, and half of France began to sing them. But as Luther and
Calvin also liked them, thi Sorbonne suspected them of Protestantism; or
perhaps in the ordeal of sue cess Marot had remumbled his heresies. The
campaign against him was re- newed. He fled to Geneva, but found the
theological climate there too severe for his health. He slipped into
Italy, and died in Turin ( 1 544) at the age of forty-nine, leaving an
illegitimate daughter to the care of the Queen of Navarre.</p>

<p>The unique, inexhaustible, skeptical, hilarious, learned, and obscene
au- thor of “the most diverting and most profitable stories which have
ever been told” 23 burst into the world in 1495, son of a prosperous
notary at Chinon. He was entered at too early an age into a Franciscan
monastery; he com- plained later that women wh o “carry children nine
months beneath their hearts… cannot bear to suffer them nine years… and
by simply adding an ell to their dress, and cutting I know not how many
hairs from the top of their head, by means of certain words they turn
them i nto birds”— i.e., they tonsure them and make them monks. The boy
accepted his fate because he was inclined to study, and probably, like
Erasmus, he was drawn to the books in the monastic library. He found
there two or three other monks who wished to study Greek, and who were
excited by the vast ancient world that scholarship was revealing.
Francois made such progress that he received a letter of praise from
Bude himself. Matters seemed to be going well, and in 1 520 the future
doubter was ordained a priest. But some older monks scented heresy in
philology; they accused the young Hellenists of buying books with the
fees they received for preaching, instead of handing the money over to
the common treasury. Rabelais and another monk were put in solitary
confinement and were deprived of books, which were to them half of life.
Bude, apprised of this contretemps, appealed to Francis I, who ordered
the scholars reinstated in freedom and privileges. Some further
intercession brought a papal rescript permitting Rabelais to change his
monastic alle- giance and residence; he left the Franciscans, and
entered a Benedictine house at Maillezais (1524). There the bishop,
Geoff roy d’Estissac, took such a fancy to him that he arranged with the
abbot that Rabelais should be al-</p>
<p>79 &lt;5 the reformation (chap, xxxv</p>
<p>lowed to go wherever he wished for his studies. Rabelais went, and
forgot to return.</p>
<p>After sampling several universities he entered the School of Medicine
at Montpellier (1530). He must have had some prior instruction, for he
re- ceived the degree of bachelor of medicine in 153 1. For reasons
unknown he did not proceed to earn the doctorate, but resumed his
wandering until, in 1532, he settled down in Lyons. Like Servetus, he
combined the practice of medicine with scholarly pursuits. He served as
editorial aide to the printer Sebastian Gryphius, edited several Greek
texts, translated the Aphorisms of Hippocrates into Latin, and was
willingly caught in the humanistic stream then in full flow at Lyons. On
November 30, 1532, he dispatched a copy of Josephus to Erasmus with a
letter of adulation strange in a man of thirty- seven, but savoring of
that enthusiastic age:</p>
<p>George d’Armagnac… recently sent me Flavius Josephus’</p>
<p>History… and asked me… to send it to you…. I have eagerly</p>
<p>seized this opportunity, O humanest of fathers, to prove to you
by</p>
<p>grateful homage my profound respect for you and my filial piety.</p>
<p>My father, did I say? I should call you mother did your
indulgence</p>
<p>allow it. All that we know of mothers, who nourish the fruit of
their</p>
<p>wombs before seeing it, before knowing even what it will be, who</p>
<p>protect it, who shelter it against the inclemency of the air — that
you have done for me, for me whose face was not known to you, and</p>
<p>whose obscure name could not impress you. You have brought me</p>
<p>up, you have fed me at the chaste breasts of your divine knowledge;
all that I am, all that I am worth, I owe to you alone. If I did not</p>
<p>publish it aloud I should be the most ungrateful of men.
Salutations</p>
<p>once more, beloved father, honor of your country, support of letters,
unconquerable champion of truth. 24</p>
<p>In that same November 1532 we find Rabelais a physician in the Hotel-
Dieu, or city hospital, of Lyons, with a salary of forty livres (,000?)
a year. But we must not think of him as a typical scholar or physician.
It is true that his learning was varied and immense. Like Shakespeare,
he seems to have had professional knowledge in a dozen fields — law,
medicine, litera- ture, theology, cookery, history, botany, astronomy,
mythology. He refers to a hundred classic legends, quotes half a hundred
classic authors; some- times he parades his erudition amateurishly. He
was so busy living that he had no time to achieve meticulous accuracy in
his scholarship; the editions that he prepared were not models of
careful detail. It was not in his charac- ter to be a dedicated humanist
like Erasmus or Bude; he loved life more than books. He is pictured for
us as a man of distinguished presence, tall and handsome, a well of
learning, a light and fire of conversation. 25 Fie was not a toper, as
an old tradition wrongly inferred from his salutes to drinkers and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 797</p>
<p>his paeans to wine; on the contrary, except for one little bastard 26
-who lived so briefly as to be only a venial sin — he led a reasonably
decent life, and was honored by the finest spirits of his time,
including several dignitaries of the Church. At the same time he had in
him many qualities of the French peasant. He relished the bluff and
hearty types that he met in the fields and streets; he enjoyed their
jokes and laughter, their tall tales and boastful rib- aldry; and
unwittingly he made Erasmus’ fame pale before his own because he
collected and connected these stories, improved and expanded them,
dignified them with classic lore, lifted them into constructive satire,
and carefully included their obscenity.</p>
<p>One story, then current in many rural areas, told of a kindly giant
named Gargantua, his cavernous appetite, his feats of love and strength;
here and there were hills and boulders which, said local traditions, had
dropped from Gargantua’s basket as he passed. Such legends were still
told, as late as 1 860, in French hamlets that had never heard of
Rabelais. An unknown writer, perhaps Rabelais himself as a tour de rire,
jotted some of the fables down, and had them printed in Lyons as The
Great and Inestimable Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant
Gargantua (1532). The book sold so readily that Rabelais conceived the
idea of writing a sequel to it about Gargantua’s son. So, at the Lyons
fair of October 1532, there appeared, anonymously, the Horribles et
espouvantables faictz et prouesses du tres renomme Panta- gruel (The
Horrible and Dreadful Deeds and Prowesses of the Most Re- nowned
Pantagruel). This name had been used in some popular dramas, but
Rabelais gave the character new content and depth. The Sorbonne and the
monks condemned the book as obscene, and it sold well; Francis I enjoyed
it, some of the clergy relished it. Not till fourteen years later did
Rabelais admit his authorship; he feared to endanger, if not his life,
his reputation as a scholar.</p>
<p>He was still so wedded to scholarship that he neglected his duties at
the hospital, and was dismissed. He might have had trouble buttering his
bread had not Jean du Bellay, Bishop of Paris and co-founder of the
College de France, taken Rabelais with him as physician on a mission to
Italy (January</p>
<p>1534). Returning to Lyons in April, Rabelais published there in
October La vie tres horrifique du grand Gargantua, pere de Pantagruel
(The Very Hor- rible Life of the Great Gargantua, father of Pantagruel).
This second vol- ume, which was later to form Book One of the full work,
contained such rollicking satires of the clergy that it won another
Sorbonnian condemna- tion. Soon the two stories, published together,
outsold every publication in France except the Bible and The Imitation
of Christ. 21 Again, we are told, King Francis laughed and
applauded.</p>
<p>But on the night of October 17-18, 1534, the posting of insulting
Protes- tant placards on Paris buildings and the King’s own doors
changed him from</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>798</p>
<p>(chap. XXXV</p>
<p>a protector of humanists into a persecutor of heretics. Rabelais had
again concealed his authorship, but it was widely suspected, and he had
good rea- son to fear that the Sorbonne, carrying the King in its train,
would demand the scandalous writer’s head. Again Jean du Bellay came to
his rescue. Now a cardinal, the genial churchman snatched the endangered
scholar-physi- cian-pornographer out of his Lyons den and took him to
Rome (1535). It was Rabelais’ luck to find there an enlightened pope.
Paul III forgave him his neglect of his monastic and priestly duties,
and gave him permission to practice medicine. As amende honorable
Rabelais expunged from future edi- tions of his now “double - backed”
book the passages most offensive to ortho - dox taste; and when Etienne
Dolet played a trick on him by publishing, without permission, an
unexpurgated edition, he crossed him from the roster of his friends.
Under the protection of the Cardinal he studied again at Montpellier,
received the doctorate in medicine, lectured to large audiences there,
and then returned to Lyons to resume his life as physician and scholar.
In June 1537, Dolet described him as conducting an anatomy lesson by
dis- secting an executed criminal before an assemblage of students.</p>
<p>Thereafter we know only snatches of his undulant career. He was in
the suite of the King at the historic meeting of Francis I and Charles V
in Aigues- mortes (July 1538). Two years later we find him at Turin as
physician to Guillaume du Bellay, brother to the Cardinal, and now
French ambassador to Savoy. About this time spies fou nd in Rabelais’
correspondence some items that raised a flurry in Paris. He hurried to
the capital, faced the matter out bravely, and was exonerated by the
King (1541). Despite renewed con- demnations of Gargantua and Pantagruel
by the Sorbonne, Francis gave the harassed author a minor post in the
government as maitre des requetes (commissioner of petitions), and
official permission to publish Book Two of Pantagruel, which Rabelais
gratefully dedicated to Marguerite of Navarre. The volume aroused such
commotion among the theologians that Rabelais judged it discreet to take
refuge in Metz, then part of the Empire. There he served for a year as
physician in the city hospital (1546-47). In 1548 he thought it safe to
return to Lyons, and in 1549 to Paris. Finally his ecclesi- astical
protectors secured his appointment (1551) as parish priest of Meu- don,
just southwest of the capital, and the hunted, aging gadfly resumed his
sacerdotal robes. Apparently he delegated the duties of his benefice to
subordinates, and confined himself to using the income. 28 So far as we
know he was still cure of Meudon when, a bit anomalously, he published
what is now Book Four of his work (1552). This was dedicated to Odet,
Cardinal de Chatillon, presumably with permission; evidently there were
then in France high churchmen of the learning and lenience of the
Italian Renais- sance cardinals. Nevertheless the book was denounced by
the Sorbonne, and its sale was forbidden by the Parlement. Francis I and
Marguerite were now</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 799</p>
<p>dead, and Rabelais found no favor with the somber Henry II. He
absented himself for a while from Paris, but soon returned. There, after
a long illness, he died (April 9, 1553). An old story tells how, when he
was asked on his deathbed where he expected to go, he answered, Je vais
chercher un grand peut-etre —“l go to seek a great perhaps.” 29 Alas, it
is a legend.</p>

<li>Gargantua</li>
</ol>
<p>The Prologue to Book One (originally Book Two) gives at once the
taste and smell of the whole:</p>
<p>Most noble and illustrious drinkers, and you thrice precious</p>
<p>pockified blades (for to you and none else do I dedicate my writ-</p>
<p>ings)…. To have eyed the outside of Socrates and esteemed of him by
his external appearance, you would not have given the peel of an onion
for him…. You, my good disciples, and some other jolly fools of ease and
leisure, reading the pleasant titles of some books of our invention… are
too ready to judge that there is nothing in them but jests, mockeries,
lascivious discourse, and recreative lies…. But..</p>
<p>in the perusal of this treatise you shall find… a doctrine of a
more</p>
<p>profound and abstract consideration… as well in what concerneth</p>
<p>our religion, as matters of public state, and life economical…. A</p>
<p>certain addle-headed coxcomb saith [ill] of my books, but a bren</p>
<p>for him…. Frolic now, my lads, cheer up your hearts, and joyfully</p>
<p>read…. Pull away, Supernaculum!</p>
<p>This is Urquhart’s famed translation, which sometimes overdoes the
origi - nal, but is here quite faithful to it, even with pithy words now
no longer permitted in learned discourse. In these two paragraphs we
have Rabelais’ spirit and aim: serious satire clothed in neck-saving
buffoonery, and some- times smeaied with unfumigated smut. We proceed at
our own risk, thank- ful that the printed word does not smell, and
trusting to find some diamonds m the dunghill.</p>
<p>Gargantua begins with a peerless genealogy Scriptural in form.
The</p>
<p>father of the giant was Grangousier, King of Utopia; the mother was
Gar- gamelle. She bore him for eleven months, and when her pains began
their friends gathered for a merry bout of wine, alleging that nature
abhors a vacuum. “On with a sheep’s courage!” the proud father tells his
wife pain - lessly; “dispatch this boy, and we will speedily fall to
work… making an - other.” For a moment she wishes him the fate of Ab 61
ard; he prop oses to accomplish this forthwith, but she changes her
mind. The unborn Gar- gantua, finding the usual outlet of maternity
blocked by an untimely as- tringent, “entered the vena cava” of
Gargamelle, climbed through her</p>
<p>800 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>diaphragm and neck, and “issued forth by the left ear.” As soon as he
was bom he cried out, so loudly that two counties heard him, A boire! d
boire! ct boire! — “Drink! drink! drink!” 17,913 cans of milk were set
aside for his nourishment, but he early showed a preference for
wine.</p>
<p>When it came time to educate the young giant, and make him fit to
succeed to the throne, he received as tutor Maitre Jobelin, who made a
dolt of him by stuffing his memory with dead facts and befuddling his
reason with Scholastic argument. Driven to a desperate expedient,
Gargantua turned the boy over to the humanist Ponocrates. Teacher and
pupil went off to Paris to get the latest education. Gargantua rode on a
tremendous mare, whose swishing tail cut down vast forests as she
proceeded; hence part of France is a plain. Arrived in Paris, Gargantua
alighted on a tower of Notre Dame; he took a fancy to the bells, and
purloined them to hang them about his horse’s neck. Ponocrates began the
re -education of the spoiled giant by giv- ing him an enormous purgative
to cleanse the bowels and the brain, which are near allied. So purified,
Gargantua became enamored of education; he began zealously to train at
once his body, his mind, and his character; he studied the Bible, the
classics, and the arts; he learned to play the lute and the virginal and
to enjoy music; he ran, jumped, wrestled, climbed, and swam; he
practiced riding, jousting, and the skills needed in war; he hunted to
develop his courage; and to develop his lungs he shouted so that all
Paris heard him. He visited metalworkers, stonecutters, goldsmiths,
alchemists, weavers, watchmakers, printers, dyers, and “giving them
somewhat to drink,” stud ied their crafts; he took part every day in
some useful physical work; and sometimes he went to a lecture, or a
trial, or to “the sermons of evangelical preachers” (a Protestant
touch).</p>
<p>Amid all this education Gargantua was suddenly called back to his
father’s realm, for another king, Picrochole, had declared war on
Grangousier. Why? Rabelais steals a story from Plutarch’s Life of
Pyrrhus , and tells how Picrochole’s generals boasted of the lands they
would conquer under his leadership: France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria,
Italy, Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, Rhodes, Greece, Jerusalem…. Picrochole
rejoices and swells. But an old philosopher asks him: “What shall be the
end of so many labors and crosses?” “When we return,” answers
Picrochole, “we shall sit down, rest, and be merry.” “But,” suggests the
philosopher, “if by chance you should never come back, for the voyage is
long and dangerous, were it not better for us to take our rest now?”
“Enough,” cried Picrochole; “go forward; I fear nothing… He that loves
me, follow me” (I, xxxiii). Gargantua’s horse al - most wins the war
against Picrochole by drowning thousands of the enemy with one simple
easement.</p>
<p>But the real hero of the war was Friar John, a monk who loved
fighting more than praying, and who let his philosophical curiosity
venture into the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 801</p>
<p>most dangerous alleys. “What is the reason,” he asks, “that the
thighs of a gentlewoman are always fresh and cool?”— and though he finds
nothing about this engaging problem in Aristotle or Plutarch, he himself
gives an- swers rich in femoral erudition. All the King’s men like him,
feed and wine him to his paunch’s content; they invite him to take off
his monastic robe to allow more eating, but he fears that without it he
will not have so good an appetite. All the faults that the Protestant
reformers alleged against the monks are satirized through this jolly
member of their tribe: their idleness, gluttony, guzzling,
prayer-mumbling, and hostility to all but a narrowing range of study and
ideas. “In our abbey,” says Friar John, “we never study, for fear of the
mumps” (I, xxxix).</p>
<p>Gargantua proposed to reward the Friar’s good fighting by making him
abbot of an existing monastery, but John begged instead to be given the
means of establishing a new abbey, with rules “contrary to all others.”
First, there should be no encompassing walls; inmates are to be free to
leave at their pleasure. Second, there is to be no exclusion of women;
however, only such women shall enter as are “fair, well - featured, of a
sweet disposition,” and between the ages of ten and fifteen. Third, only
men between twelve and eighteen will be accepted, and they must be
comely, and of good birth and manners; no sots or bigots may apply, no
beggars, lawyers, judges, scribes, usurers, gold- graspers, or
“sniveling hypocrites.” Fourth, no vows of chastity, poverty, or
obedience; the members may marry, enjoy wealth, and in all matters be
free. The abbey is to be called Theleme, or What You Will, and its sole
rule will be Fais ce que vous vouldras — “Do what you wish.” For “men
that are free, wellborn, well -bred, and conversant in honest com-
panies, have naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth them to
virtuous actions and withdraws them from vice; and this instinct is
called Honor” (I, lvii). Gargantua provided the funds for this
aristocratic anarchism, and the abbey rose according to specifications
which Rabelais gave in such detail that architects have made drawings of
it. He provided for it a library, a theater, a swimming pool, a tennis
court, a football field, a chapel, a garden, a hunting park, orchards,
stables, and 9,332 rooms. It was an American hotel in vacation land.
Rabelais forgot to provide a kitchen, or to explain who would do the
menial work in this paradise.</p>

<p>After Gargantua had succeeded his father as king he took his turn at
procreation and pedagogy. At the age of “four hundred fourscore forty
and four years” he begot Pantagruel on Badebec, who died in giving

who had to be excavated by a mining operation in the young giant’s

Gargantua sent him a letter redolent of the Renaissance:</p>

<p>Pantagruel studied zealously, learned many languages, and might have
be- come a bookworm had he not met Panurge. Here again, even more than
in Friar John, the subordinate character stands out more clearly than
his master, as Sancho Panza sometimes outshines the Don. Rabelais does
not find full scope for his irreverent humor and riotous vocabulary in
Gargantua or Pantagruel; he needs this quarter-scoundrel,
quarter-lawyer, quarter- Villon, quarter-philosopher as a vehicle for
his satire. He describes Panurge (which means “Ready to do anything”) as
lean like a starving cat, walking gi ngerly “as if he trod on eggs”; a
gallant fellow, but a little lecherous, and “subject</p>
<p>As the story rollicks on into Book Three, Panurge debates with
himself and others whether he should marry. He lists the arguments pro
and con through a hundred pages, some sparkling, many wearisome; but in
those pages we meet the man who married a dumb wife, and the renowned
jurist Bridlegoose, who arrives at his soundest judgments by throwing
dice. The Prologue to Book Four catches a cue from Lucian and describes
a “con - sistory of gods” in heaven, with Jupiter complaining about the
unearthly chaos reigning on the earth, the thirty wars going on at once,
the mutual hatreds of the peoples, the divisions of theologies, the
syllogisms of the phi- losophers. “What shall we do with this Ramus and

<p>Returning to earth, he records in Books Four and Five * the long
Gulli- verian voyages of Pantagruel, Panurge, Friar John, and a royal
Utopian fleet to find the Temple of the Holy Bottle, and to ask whether
Panurge should marry. After a score of adventures, satirizing Lenten
fasts, Protes- tant pope-haters, bigot pope-olators, monks, dealers in
fake antiques, lawyers (“furred cats”), Scholasti c philosophers, and
historians, the expedition reaches the Temple. Over the portal is a
Greek inscription to the effect that “in wine there is truth.” In a near
-by fountain is a half-submerged bottle, from which a voice emerges,
gurgling, Trinc; and the priestess Bacbuc ex- plains that wine is the
best philosophy, and that “not laughing but drink - ing… cool, delicious
wine… is the distinguishing character of man.” Panurge is happy to have
the oracle confirm what he has known all the time. He resolves to eat,
drink, and be married, and to take the consequences manfully. He sings
an obscene hymeneal chant, and Bacbuc dismisses the party with a
blessing: “May that intellectual sphere whose center is every - where,
and its circumference nowhere, whom we call God, keep you in His
Almighty protection” (V, xlvii ). So, with a typical blend of lubricity
and philosophy, the great romance comes to an end.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The King’s Jester</li>
</ol>
<p>What sense is there behind this nonsense, and is there any wisdom in
this demijohn of Falernian- Priapean hilarity? “We country clowns,”
Rabelais makes one of his asses say, “are somewhat gross, and apt to
knock words out of joint” (V, vii). He loves words, has an endless
supply of them, and invents a thousand more; he draws them, like
Shakespeare, from every occu- pation and profession, every field of
philosophy, theology, and law. He makes lists of adjectives, nouns, or
verbs, as if for the pleasure of contem- plating them (III, xxxviii) ;
he multiplies synonyms in an ecstasy of redun- dancy; this pleonasm was
already an old trick on the French stage. 32 It is part of Rabelais’
boundless and uncontrollable humor, an overflow beside which even the
humor of Aristophanes or Moliere is a modest trickle. His coarseness is
another phase of this unmanageable flux. Perhaps some of it was a
reaction against monastic asceticism, some of it the anatomical indif-
ference of a physician, some of it a bold defiance of pedantic
precision; much of it was in the manner of the age. Undoubtedly Rabelais
carries it to excess; aftei a dozen pages of urogenital, excretory, and
gaseous details we</p>

<p>weary and turn away. Another generation of classic influence would be
needed to tame such volcanic exuberance into disciplined form.</p>
<p>We forgive these faults because Rabelais’ style runs away with us, as
with him. It is an unpretentious, unliterary style, natural, easy,
flowing, just the medium for telling a long story. The secret of his
verve is imagination plus energy plus clarity; he sees a thousand things
unobserved by most of us, notes innumerable quirks of dress and conduct
and speech, unites them fantastically, and sets the mixtures chasing one
another over the sportive page.</p>
<p>He borrows right and left, as the custom was, and with Shakespeare’s
ex - cuse, that he betters everything that he steals. He helps himself
to hundreds of proverbial snatches from Erasmus’ Adagia , 33 and follows
many a lead from The Praise of Folly or the Colloquies. He assimilates
half a hundred items from Plutarch, years before Amyot’s translation
opened that treasury</p>
<p>Because he loved life he flayed those who made it less lovable.
Perhaps he was a bit too hard on the monks who had been unable to share
his humanistic devotions. He must have been clawed by a lawyer or two,
for he tears their fur revengefully. Mark my words, he warns his
readers, “if you live but six Olympiads and the age of two dogs more,
you’ll see these law -cats lords of all Europe.” But he lays his whip
also upon judges, Scholastics, theologians, historians, travelers,
indulgence peddlers, and women. There is hardly a good word for women in
all the book; this is Rabelais’ blindest spot, perhaps the price he
paid, as monk and priest and bachelor, for never earning tender-
ness.</p>
<p>Partisans have debated whether he was a Catholic, a Protestant, a
free- thinker, or an atheist. Calvin thought him an atheist; and “my own
belief,” concluded his lover Anatole France, “is that he believed
nothing.” 34 At’ times he wrote like the most irreverent cynic, as in
the language of the sheep drover about the best way to fertilize a field
(IV, vii). He ridiculed fasting, indulgences, inquisitors, decretals,
and enjoyed explaining the an-</p>
<p>8o 6</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>atomical requisites for becoming a pope (IV, xlviii). He had
evidently no belief in hell (II, xxx). He echoed the Protestant
arguments that the papacy was draining the nations of their gold (IV,
liii), and that the cardinals of Rome lived lives of gluttony and
hypocrisy (IV, lviii-lx). He sympathized with the French heretics;
Pantagruel, he says, did not stay long in Toulouse, because there they
“bum their regents alive, like red herrings”— referring to the execution
of an heretical professor of law (II, v). But his Protestant sympathies
seem to have been limited to those who were humanists. He fol- lowed
Erasmus admiringly, but only mildly favored Luther, and he turned with
distaste from the dogmatism and puritanism of Calvin. He was tolerant of
everything but intolerance. Like nearly all the humanists, when driven
to choose, he preferred Catholicism with its legends, intolerance, and
art to Protestantism with its predestination, intolerance, and purity.
He repeatedly affirmed his faith in the fundamentals of Christianity,
but this may have been the prudence of a man who, in defense of his
opinions, was willing to go to the stake exclusively. He loved his
definition of God so well that he (or his continuator) repeated it (III,
xiii; V, xlvii). He apparently accepted the im- mortality of the soul
(II, viii; IV, xxvii) , but in general he preferred scatology to
eschatology. Farel called him a renegade for accepting the pastorate of
Meudon, 35 but this was understood, by donor and recipient, as merely a
way of eating.</p>
<p>His real faith was in Nature, and here, perhaps, he was as trustful
and credulous as his orthodox neighbors. He believed that ultimately the
forces of Nature work for good, and he underestimated her neutrality as
between men and fleas. Like Rousseau, and against Luther and Calvin, he
believed in the natural goodness of man; or, like other humanists, he
was confident that a good education and a good environment would make
men good. Like Montaigne, he counseled men to follow Nature, and
possibly he looked with impish unconcern on what would then happen to
society and civili- zation. In describing the Abbey of Theleme he seemed
to be preaching philosophical anarchism, but it was not so; he would
admit to it only those whose good breeding, education, and sense of
honor would fit them for the trials of freedom.</p>
<p>His final philosophy was “Pantagruelism.” This must not be confused
with the useful weed Pantagruelion, which is merely hemp, and whose
final virtue is that it can make appropriate neckties for criminals.
Pantagruelism is living like Pantagruel — in a genial and tolerant
fellowship with Nature and men, in grateful enjoyment of all the good
things of life, and in cheerful acceptance of our inescapable
vicissitudes and termination. Once Rabelais defined Pantagruelism as une
certtnne gaiete &lt;T esprit confite de mepris des choses fortuites —“a
certain gaiety of spirit prese rved in contempt of the accidents of
life” (IV, Prologue). It combined Zeno the Stoic, Diogenes</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXV) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 807</p>
<p>he Cynic, and Epicurus: to bear all natural events with equanimity,
to view without offense all natural impulses and operations, and to
enjoy every sane pleasure without puritanic inhibitions or theological
remorse. Panta- gruel “took all things in good part, and interpreted
every action in the best sense; he neither vexed nor disquieted himself…
since all the goods that the earth contains… are not of so much worth as
that we should for them disturb or disorder our emotions, trouble or
perplex our senses or spirits” (III, ii). We must not exaggerate the
epicurean element in this philosophy; R abelais’ litanies to wine were
more verbal than alcoholic; they do not quite comport with a
contemporary’s description of him as a man of “serene, gracious, and
open countenance”; 86 the wine he celebrated was the wine of life. And
this pretended Lord of Dipsophily put into the mouth of Gargantua a
sentence that in ten words phrases the challenge of our own time:
“Science</p>
<p>France has treasured Rabelais more than any other of her giants of
the pen except Montaigne, Moliere, and Voltaire. In his own century
Etienne Pas- quier called him the greatest writer of the age. In the

classic form became liter- ally de rigueur, he lost some standing in the
nation’s memory; but even then</p>

<p>Meanwhile a veritable flood of poetry was pouring over France. We
know some 200 French poets in the reigns of Francis and his sons; and
these were no vapid mourners in an unheeding wilderness; they were
warriors in a literary battle — form vs. content, Ronsard vs. Rabelais —
that determined the character of French literature till the
Revolution.</p>
<p>A complex ecstasy inspired them. They longed to rival the Greeks and
Romans in purity of sry’“ and perfection of form, and the Italian

<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>in grace of speech and imagery; nevertheless they were resolved to
write not in Latin, like the scholars who were instructing and exciting
them, but in their native French; and at the same time they proposed to
mellow and refine that still rough tongue by teaching it words, phrases,
constructions, and ideas judiciously pilfered from the classics. The
episodic formlessness of Rabelais ’ romance made it, in their eyes, a
crude vessel of clay hastily turned by hand, unpainted and unglazed.
They would add to his earthly vitality the discipline of form carefully
designed, and of feeling rationally controlled. The classical crusade
began in the Lyons of Rabelais himself. Maurice Seve spent part of his
life locating, as he thought, the tomb of Petrarch’s</p>
<p>The very word was a classic echo, for in the Alexandria of the third
cen- tury before Christ a galaxy of seven poets had likewise been named
from the constellation that commemorated the seven mythological
daughters of Atlas and Ple’ione. Ronsard, brightest star in the French
Pleiade, rarely used that term, and his models were Anacreon and Horace
rather than Alexan- drian Theocritus or Callimachus. It was in 1548, at
an inn in Touraine, that he met Joachim du Bellay, and conspired with
him to make French poetry classical. They won to their enterprise four
other young poets — Antoine de Bai’f, Remi Belleau, Etienne Jodelle, and
Ponthus de Thyard; and they were joined also by the scholar Jean Dorat,
whose lectures on Greek literature at the College de France and the
College de Coqueret fired them with enthusi- asm for the lyric singers
of ancient Greece. They called themselves La Brigade, and vowed to
rescue the French muse from the coarse hands of Jean de Meung and
Rabelais, and the loose measures of Villon and Marot. They turned their
noses from the riotous language and privy wisdom of Gargantua and
Pantagruel; they found no classic restraint in those jumbled verbs and
adjectives, those coprophilic ecstasies, no feeling for beauty of form
in woman, nature, or art. A hostile critic, seeing them seven, dubbed
them La Pleiade. Their victory turned the word into a flag of fame.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 809</p>
<p>In 1549 Du Bellay proclaimed the linguistic program of the Brigade in
a Defense et illustration de la langue frangoyse. By defense he meant
that the French language could be enabled to express all that the
classic tongues had uttered; by illustration he meant that French could
take on new luster, could brighten and polish itself, by putting aside
the rough speech of prevalent French prose, and the ballad, roundel,
virelay forms of French poesy, and purify and enrich itself by importing
classical terms and studying classical forms, as in Anacreon,
Theocritus, Virgil, Horace, and Petrarch. For to the Pleiade Petrarch
was already a classic, and the sonnet was the most perfect of all
literary forms.</p>
<p>Pierre de Ronsard realized in his verse the ideals that Du Bellay
voiced in splendid prose. He came of a recently ennobled family; his
father was mcntre d’hdtel to Francis I, and for some time Pierre lived
at the brilliant court. He was successively page to the Dauphin Francis,
then to the Madeleine who married James V of Scotland, then ecuyer or
squire to the future Henry II. He looked forward to military exploits,
but at sixteen he began to grow deaf. He sheathed his sword and
brandished a pen. He fell in with Virgil by acci- dent, and saw in him a
perfection of form and speech as yet unknown in France. Dorat led him on
from Latin to Greek, and taught him to read Anacreon, Aeschylus, Pindar,
Aristophanes. “O Master!” cried the youth, “why have you hidden these
riches from me so long?” 88 At twenty -four he met Du Bellay. Thereafter
he divided his time devotedly among song, woman, and wine.</p>
<p>His Odes (1550) completed the lyric revolt. They frankly imitated
Hor- ace, but they introduced the ode into French poetry, and stood on
their own feet in purity of language, elegance of phrase, precision of
form. Two years later, in the 183 sonnets of his Amours , he took
Petrarch as his model, and achieved a grace and refinement never
surpassed in French poetry. He wrote to be sung, and many of his poems
were put to music during his lifetime, some by famous composers like
Jannequin and Goudimel. He offered to the women he courted the old
invitation to make play while beauty shines, but even on that ancient
theme he struck an original note, as when he warned one prudent lass
that she would someday regret having lost the opportunity of being
seduced by so renowned a bard:</p>

<p>The exaltation of style suited well the court of Catherine de
Medicis, who had brought to France an Italian retinue bearing Petrarch
in their books. The new poet — hard of hearing but proud of carriage,
with martial figure, golden hair and beard, and the face of Praxiteles’
Hermes — became a favorite of Catherine, Henry II, Mary Stuart, even of
Elizabeth of England, who, as his seventeenth cousin, sent him a diamond
ring. The Greco-Roman my- thology of the Pleiade was welcomed; when the
poets talked of Olympus the court acknowledged the compliment; 80 Henry
became Jupiter, Cather- ine Juno, Diane Diana; and the sculpture of
Goujon confirmed the com- parison.</p>
<p>When Henry died, Charles IX continued to befriend Ronsard, not quite
to good result, for the young monarch wanted an epic about France to
match the Aeneid. “I can give death,” wrote the royal simpleton, “but
you can give immortality.” 40 Ronsard began a Franciade, but found his
muse too short of breath for so long a run; soon he gave up the
pretense, and re- turned to lyrics and love. He passed peacefully into
old age, protected from the noise of the world, safely conservative in
politics and religion, revered by younger minstrels, and respected by
all but death. It came in 1585. He was buried at Tours, but Paris gave
him an Olympian funeral, in which all the notables of the capital
marched to hear a bishop intone an oraison funebre.</p>
<p>The poets who called him prince produced many volumes of verse,</p>
<p>delicate but dead. Most of them, like the master, were pagans who at
their ease professed Catholic orthodoxy, and scorned the moralistic
Huguenots. However poor these poets might be in pocket, they were
aristocrats in pride, sometimes in blood, and they wrote for a circle
that had the leisure to relish form. Rabelais returned their hostility
by ridiculing their pedantry, their servile imitation of Greek and Roman
meters, phrases, and epithets, their thin echoes of ancient themes and
Petrarchan conceits and laments. In that</p>

<p>conflict between naturalism and classicism the fate of French
literature was decided. The poets and tragic dramatists of France would
choose the straight and narrow path of perfect structure and chiseled
grace; the prose writers would aim to please by force of substance
alone. Hence French poetry before the Revolution is untranslatable; the
vase of form cannot be shattered and then be refashioned in an alien
mold. In nineteenth-century France the two streams met, the half-truths
merged, content married form, and French prose became supreme.</p>

<p>Not as a flood, but as a river flowing through many outlets to the
sea, the influence of Italy passed through France and reached England.
The scholarship of one generation inspired the literature of the next;
the divine revelation of ancient Greece and Rome became the Bible of the
Renaissance. In i486 the plays of Plautus were staged in Italy, and soon
thereafter at the rival courts of Francis I and Henry VIII. In 1508
Bibbiena’s Calandra began the vernacular classic comedy in Italy; in
1552 Jodelle’s Cleopatre captive began the vernacular classic tragedy in
France; in 1553 Nicholas Udall produced the first English comedy in
classical form. Ralph Roister Doister , said a critic, “smelt of
Plautus”; 41 it did; but it smelled of England too, and of that robust
humor that Shakespeare would serve to the ground- lings at the
Elizabethan theaters.</p>
<p>The Italian influence appeared brightest in the poetry of the Tudor
reigns. The medieval style survived in such pretty ballads as The
Not-broame Mayd (1521); but when the poets who basked in the sun of
young Henry VIII took to verse their ideal and model were Petrarch and
his Canzoniere. Just a year before Elizabeth’s accession, Richard
Tottel, a London printer, pub - lished a Miscellany in which the poems
of two distinguished courtiers re- vealed the triumph of Petrarch over
Chaucer, of classic form over medieval exuberance. Sir Thomas Wyatt, as
a diplomat in the sendee of the King, made many a trip to France and
Italy, and brought back some Italians to help him civilize his friends.
Like a good Renaissance cortigiano, he burned his fingers in love’s
fire: he was, said tradition, one of Anne Boleyn’s early</p>

gallantly for Eng- land in France. Returning, he toyed too audibly with
the idea of becoming king of England. He was condemned to be hanged,
drawn, and quartered, but was let off with decapitation (1547).</p>
<p>Poetry was an incidental ornament in this strenuous life. Surrey
translated some books of the Aeneid , introduced blank verse into
English literature, and gave the sonnet the form that Shakespeare was to
use. Perhaps fore- seeing that the paths of undue glory might lead to
the block, he addressed</p>

<p>The mind of Germany, in the century that followed Luther’s Theses,
was lost in the hundred years’ debate that prepared the Thirty Y ears’

general, fewer books were issued; they were replaced by a torrent of
controversial pam- phlets. Thomas Murner, a Franciscan monk with an acid
pen, scourged everybody with a chain of booklets about rascals or dolts

persecuted sect, con- demned Lutheran intolerance, was expelled from
Strasbourg, and made { living by boiling soap in Ulm. He ridiculed the
determination of religious orthodoxy by the German dukes, noting that
“if one prince dies and his successor brings in another creed, this at
once becomes God’s Word.” 44 “Mad zeal possesses all men today, that we
should believe… that God is ours alone, that there is no heaven, faith,
spirit, Christ, but in our sect.” His own faith was a universalist
theism that closed no doors. “My heart is alien to none. I have my
brothers among the Turks, Papists, Jews, and all peo- ples.” 46 He
aspired to “a free, unsectarian… Christianity, bound to no outer thing,”
not even to the Bible. 46 Shocked by sentiments so unbecoming to his
century, Ulm banished him in its turn. He found work as a printer in
Basel, and died there in honest penury (1542).</p>
<p>German poetry and drama were now so immersed in theology that they
ceased to be arts and became weapons of war. In this strife any jargon,
coarseness, and obscenity were held legitimate; except for folk songs
and hymns, poetry disappeared in a fusillade of poisoned rhymes. The
lavishly staged religious dramas of the fifteenth century passed out of
public taste, and were succeeded by popular farces lampooning Luther or
the popes.</p>
<p>Now and then a man rose above the fury to see life whole. If Hans
Sachs had obeyed the magistrates of Nuremberg he would have remained a
shoe- maker; for when, without securing the civic imprimatur, he
published a rhyming history of the Tower of Babel, they suppressed the
book, assured him that poetry was obviously not his line, and bade him
stick to his last. 47 Yet Hans had some rights, for he had passed
through the usual stages to become a Meistersinger, and the anomaly of
his being a cobbler and a poet fades when we note that the guild of
weavers and shoemakers to which he belonged regularly practiced choral
song, and gave public concerts thrice a year. For this guild, and at any
other opportunity, Sachs wrote songs and plays as assiduously as if he
were mouthing nails.</p>
<p>We must think of him not as a great poet, but as a sane and cheerful
voice in a century of hate. His basic interest was in simple people, not
in geniuses; his plays were almost always about such people; and even
God, in these dramas, is a benevolent commoner, who talks like some
parson of the neigh- borhood. While most writers peppered their pages
with bitterness, vulgarity, or ribaldry, Hans portrayed and exalted the
virtues of affection, duty, piety, marital fidelity, parental and filial
love. His first published poems (1516)</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>814</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>proposed “to promote the praise and glory of God,” and “to help his
fellow creatures to a life of penitence”; 48 and this religious spirit
warmed his writ - ings to the end. He turned half the Bible into rhyme,
using Luther’s transla - tion as a text. He saluted Luther as “the
Nightingale of Wittenberg,” who would cleanse religion and restore
morality.</p>
<p>Awake! awake! the day is near,</p>
<p>And in the woods a song I hear.</p>
<p>It is the glorious nightingale;</p>
<p>Her music rings on hill and dale.</p>
<p>The night falls into Occident,</p>
<p>The day springs up in Orient,</p>
<p>The dawn comes and sets alight</p>
<p>The gloomy clouds of parting night. 40</p>
<p>Now Sachs became the bard of the Reformation, satirizing the faults
of Catholics with doggerel tenacity. He wrote plays about rascally
monks, and traced the origin of their tribe to the Devil; he issued
burlesques and farces which showed, for example, a priest seducing a
girl or saying Mass while drunk; in 1558 he published a History in Rhyme
of the Popess Joanna — a fable which most Protestant preachers accepted
as history. But Hans satirized Lutherans too, denouncing their lives as
scandalously contrary to their creed: “With your flesh -eating, your
uproars, your abuse of priests, your quarrel- ing, mocking, insulting,
and all your other improper behavior, you Lutherans have brought the
Gospel into great contempt.” 50 He joined a hundred others in mourning
the commercialism and immorality of the age.</p>
<p>All in all, and discounting Wagner’s ideal ization, Hans Sachs may
typify the bluff and crude but kindly German who, at least in the south,
must have been in the majority. We picture him happy and melodious for
forty years in his home and his poetry. When his first wife died (1560)
he married, at sixty-eight, a pretty woman of twenty-seven, and survived
even this trial. There is something to be said for an age and a city in
which a cobbler could become a humanist, a poet, and a musician, acquire
and use a large library, learn Greek literature and philosophy, write
6,000 poems, and live in reason- able health and happiness to die at the
age of eighty- two.</p>

<p>This was a lively time in the literature of Portugal. The exciting
stimulus of the explorations, the spreading wealth of expanding
commerce, the influence of Italy, the humanists at Coimbra and Lisbon,
the patronage of a cultivated court, joined in an efflorescence that
would soon culminate in the Lusiads (1572) of Camoens. A merrv battle
raged between the Eschola Velha — Old School —</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 8 15</p>
<p>of Gil Vicente, who cherished native themes and forms, and Os
Quinhentistas — The Men of the Fifteenth (our Sixteenth) Century — who
followed Sa de Miranda in enthusiasm for Italian and classic modes and
styles. For thirty-four years (1502- 36) Gil Vicente, “the Portuguese
Shakespeare,” dominated the theater with his simple autos , or acts; the
court smiled upon him, and expected him to celebrate every royal event
with a play; and when the king was quarrel- ing with the pope Gil was
allowed to satirize the papacy with such freedom that Aleander, seeing
one of Vicente’s plays in Brussels, “thought I was in mid -Saxony
listening to Luther.” 51 The fe rtile dramatist wrote sometimes in
Spanish, some- times in Portuguese, sometimes in both, with scraps of
Italian and French, Church Latin and peasant slang, thrown in. Often the
action of the piece was interrupted, as in Shakespeare, with lyrics that
crept into the hearts of the people. Like Shakespeare, Gil was actor as
well as playwright; he was stage manager as well, and directed the
settings. For good measure he was one of the best goldsmiths of the
age.</p>
<p>In 1524 Francisco Sa de Miranda returned from a six years’ stay in
Italy, and brought with him the classical fever of the Renaissance. Like
Ronsard and the Pleiade in France, like Spenser and Sidney in England,
he proposed to dignify the national literature by modeling its subjects,
meters, and style on classical lines; like Joachim du Bellay, he
included Petrarch among the classics, and in- troduced the sonnet to his
countrymen; like Jodelle he wrote the first classical tragedy in his
native tongue (1550); and he had already (1527) written the first
Portuguese prose comedy in classic form. His friend Bernardim Ribeiro
com- posed bucolic poetry in the style of Virgil, and lived a tragedy in
the manner of Tasso: he made such a stir with his passion for a lady of
the court that he was banished; he was forgiven and restored to royal
favor, and died insane (1552).</p>
<p>A school of colorful historians recorded the triumphs of the
explorers. Caspar Correa went out to India, rose to be one of
Albuquerque’s secretaries, denounced official corruption, and was
murdered in Malacca in 1565. Amid this active life he wrote in eight
volumes what he called “a brief summary” of the Portuguese</p>
<p>The Castilian tongue had now become the literary language of Spain.
Gali- cian, Valencian, Catalonian, Andalusian dialects survived in the
speech of the people, and Galician became Portuguese; but the use of
Castilian as the language</p>
<p>8i 6</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP XXXV</p>
<p>of state and Church under Ferdinand, Isabella, and Ximenes gave that
dialect an insuperable prestige, and from their time to ours its
masculine sonority has carried the literature of Spain. An infatuation
with language appeared in some writers of this age. Antonio de Guevara
set an example of linguistic conceits and rhetorical flourishes, and the
translation of his Reloj de principes ( Dial of Princes , 152 9) by Lord
Berners helped to mold the euphuism of John Lyly’s Euphues , and the
silly wordplay of Shakespeare’s early comedies.</p>
<p>Spanish literature sang of religion, love, and war. The passion for
romances of chivalry reached such a height that in 1555 the Cortes
recommended that they be prohibited by law; such a decree was actually
issued in Spanish America; had it been enforced in Spain we might have
missed Don Quixote. One of the romances spared by the curate in the
purification of the Knight’s li brary was the Diana enamor ata ( 1 542)
of Jorge de Montemayor; it imitated the Arcadia ( 1 504) of the
Spanish-Italian poet Sannazaro, and was itself imitated by Sir Philip
Sidney’s Arcadia (1590). Montemayor’s prose -and-poetry romance was one
of a thousand instances of Italian influence on Spanish literature; here
again the conquered conquered the conquerors. Juan Boscan translated
Castiglione’s Cortigiano into prose quite worthy of the original, and
accepted the suggestion of the Venetian poet Navagero to popularize the
sonnet form in Spain.</p>
<p>His friend Garcilaso de la Vega almost at once brought the form to
perfection in Castilian. Like so many Spanish writers of this period, he
came of high lineage; his father was ambassador of Ferdinand and
Isabella at Rome. Born at Toledo in 1503, Garcilaso was early dedicated
to arms. In 1532 he distinguished himself in the repulse of the Turks
from Vienna; in 1535 he was twice severely wounded in the siege of
Tunis; a few months later he shared in Charle s V’s futile campaign in
Provence. At Frejus he volunteered to lead an attack upon an obstructive
castle; he was the first to mount the wall; he received a blow on the
head from which he died a few days later, aged thirty-three. One of the
thirty-seven sonnets which he bequeathed to his friend Boscan struck a
note that has echoed in every war:</p>
<p>And now larger than ever lies the curse</p>
<p>On this our time; and all that went before</p>
<p>Keeps altering its face from bad to worse;</p>
<p>And each of us has felt the touch of war —</p>
<p>War after war, and exile, dangers, fear —</p>
<p>And each of us is weary to the core</p>
<p>Of seeing his own blood along a spear</p>
<p>And being alive because it missed its aim.</p>
<p>Some folks have lost their goods and all their gear,</p>
<p>And everything is gone, even the name</p>
<p>Of house and home and wife and memory.</p>
<p>And what’s the use of it? A little fame?</p>
<p>The nation’s thanks? A place in history?</p>
<p>One day they’ll write a book, and then we’ll see. 61</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 817</p>
<p>He could not see, but a thousand books commemorated him fondly.
Historians recorded his death among the leading events of the time. His
poems were printed in handy volumes which were carried in the pockets of
Spanish soldiers into a dozen lands. Spanish lutenists put his lyrics to
music as madrigals for the vihuela, and dramatists turned his eclogues
into plays.</p>
<p>The Spanish drama marked time, and could not know that it would soon
rival the Elizabethan. One-act comedies, farcical satires, or episodes
from popu- lar romances were performed by strolling players in a public
square or the corrale — yard — of an inn, sometimes at a princely seat
or royal court. Lope de Rueda, who succeeded Gil Vicente as chief
provider of autos for such troupes, made his fame — and gave us a word —
with his bobos&gt; clowns.</p>
<p>Historians abounded. Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo was appointed his-
toriographer of the New World by Charles V, and acquitted himself
indiffer- ently well with a voluminous and ill-ordered Historia general
y natural de las Indias Occidentales (1535). During forty years of
residence in Spanish America he grew rich from mining gold, and he
resented the Brevisima relacion de la destruycion de las Indias (1539
f.), in which Bartolom6 de las Casas exposed the merciless exploitation
of native slave labor in the American mines. Las Casas sailed with
Columbus in 1502, became Bishop of Chiapa in Mexico, and gave nearly all
his life to the cause of the Indians. In Memorials addressed to the
Spanish government he described the rapidity with which the natives were
dying under the arduous conditions of work imposed upon them by the
settlers. The Indians had been accustomed by their warm climate and
simple diet to only casual labor; they had not mined gold, but had been
content to derive it from the surface of the earth or the beds of
shallow streams, and used it only as an ornament. Las Casas calculated
that the native population of the “Indies” had been reduced from 1
2,000,000 (doubtless too high a guess) to 14,000 in thirty-eight years.
53 Dominican and Jesuit missionaries joined with Las Casas in protesting
against Indian slavery, 54 and Isabella repeatedly denounced it. 55
Ferdinand and Ximenes prescribed semi-humane conditions for the
conscription of Indian labor, 56 but while these gentlemen were
engrossed in European politics their instructions for the treatment of
the natives were mostly ignored.</p>
<p>A minor debate concerned the conquest of Mexico. Francisco Lopez de
Gomara gave a very Cortesian account of that rape; Bernal Diaz del
Castillo, in protest, composed (1568 f.) his Historia verdadera de la
conquista de la Nueva Espana , which, while giving due praise to Cortes,
condemned him for taking all the honors and profits of the conquest,
leaving little for such brave soldiers as Bernal. It is a fascinating
book, full of the lust of action, the joy of victory, and honest
amazement at the wealth and splendor of Aztec Mexico. “When I beheld the
scenes that were around me, I thought within myself that this was the
garden of the world.” And then he adds, “All is destroyed.” 57</p>
<p>The most mature Spanish history and the most famous Spanish novel of
this period have been attributed to the same man. Diego Hurtado de
Mendoza was bom at Granada some eleven years after its conquest by
Ferdinand; his father had won laurels in the siege, and had been made
governor of the city after its</p>
<p>8 1 8 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>fall. Educated at Salamanca, Bologna, and Padua, Mendoza acquired a
wide culture in Latin, Greek, and Arabic, in philosophy and law; he
collected classic texts with the zeal of a Renaissance prince; and when
Suleiman the Magnificent bade him name his reward for certain good
offices he had performed for the Porte, he asked only for some Greek
manuscripts. He rose to high place in the diplomatic service of Charles
V at Venice, Rome, and the Council of Trent. Rebuked by Paul III for
conveying some harsh message from Charles to the Pope, he answered with
all the pride of a Spanish grandee: “I am a cavalier, my father was one
before me, and as such it is my duty to fulfill the commands of my royal
master, without any fear of your Holiness, so long as I observe due
reverence to the vicegerent of Christ. I am minister to the King of
Spain. ,. safe, as his representative, even from your Holiness’s
displeasure.” 58</p>
<p>Recent research questions Mendoza’s authorship of the first
picaresque novel in European literature — The Life and Adventures of
Lazarillo de Tonnes. Though not printed till 1553, it had probably been
written many years before. That a scion of a family only less noble than
the king’s should make a thief his hero would be startling; more so that
a man originally intended for the priesthood should include in his story
such sharp satires of the clergy that the Inquisition forbade any
further printing of the book until it had been ex- purgated of all
offense. 59 Lazarillo * is a waif who, as guide to a blind beggar,
acquires the tricks of petty larceny, and rises to higher crimes as
servant to a priest, a friar, a chaplain, a bailiff, a seller of
indulgences. Even the worldly wise young thief is impressed with some of
the marvels arranged by the indulgence peddler in promoting his wares.
“I must confess that I, amongst many others, was deceived at the time,
and thought my master a miracle of sanctity.” 60 This rollicking
narrative set the gusto picaresco , or “style of the rogue,” in fiction;
it evoked innumerable imitations, culminating in the most renowned of
picaresque romances, the Gil Bias (1715-35) of Alain Lesage.</p>
<p>Exiled from the court of Philip II for drawing his sword in an
argument, Mendoza retired to Granada, composed incidental verses too
free to be printed during his lifetime, and recounted the Moorish revolt
of 1568-70 in an Historia de la guerra de Granada so impartial, so just
to the Moors, that this too could not find a publisher, and saw print
only in 1610, and then only in part. Mendoza took Sallust for his model,
rivaled him, and stole a theme or two from Tacitus; but all in all, this
was the first Spanish work that advanced beyond mere chronicle or
propaganda to factual history interpreted with philosophical grasp and
presented with literary ai’t. Mendoza died in 1 575, aged seventy-two.
He was one of the most complete personalities of a time rich in complete
men. Always, in these hurried pages, conscience runs a race with time,
and warns the hurrying pen that, like the hasty traveler, it is but
scratching sur- faces. How many publishers, teachers, scholars, patrons,
poets, romancers, and reckless rebels labored for half a century to
produce the literature that</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXV ) LITERATURE IN THE AGE OF RABELAIS 819</p>
<p>here has been so narrowly confined, so many masterpieces unnamed,
nations ignored, once immortal geniuses slighted with a line! It cannot
be helped. The ink runs dry; and while it lasts it must be enough if
from its scratches and splashes some hazy picture unfolds of men and
women resting a while from theology and war, loving the forms of beauty
as well as the mirages of truth and power, and building, carving,
painting words until thought finds an art to clothe it, wisdom and music
merge, and literature arises to let a na- tion speak, to let an age pour
its spirit into a mold so fondly fashioned that time itself will cherish
’ ana carry it down tnrough a thousand catastrophes</p>
