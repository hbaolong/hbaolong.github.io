<h4 id="chapter-xx-letters-and-arts">CHAPTER XX Letters and Arts</h4>
<p>in the Fourth Century</p>
<p>I. THE ORATORS</p>
<p>T hrough all this turmoil literature reflected the declining
virility</p>
<p>of Greece. Lyrical poetry was no longer the passionate expression</p>
<p>of creative individuals, but a polite exercise of salon
intellectuals, a learned echo of schoolday tasks. Timotheus of Miletus
wrote an epic, but it did not accord with an argumentative age, and
remained as unpopular as his early music. Dramatic performances
continued, but on a more modest scale and in a lower key. The
impoverishment of the public treasury and the weakened patriotism of
private wealth reduced the splendor and sig- nificance of the chorus;
more and more the dramatists contented them- selves with unrelated
musical intermezzi in place of choruses organically united with the
play. The name of the choragus disappeared from public notice, then the
name of the poet; only the name of the actor remained. The drama became
less and less a poem, more and more a histrionic exhibi- tion; it was an
era of great actors and small dramatists. Greek tragedy had been built
upon religion and mythology, and required some faith and piety in its
auditors; it naturally faded away in the twilight of the gods.</p>
<p>Comedy prospered as tragedy decayed, and took over something of the
subtlety, refinement, and subject matter of the Euripidean stage. This
Middle Comedy (400-323) lost its taste or courage for political satire
pre- cisely when politics mos t needed a “candid friend”; possibly such
satire was forbidden or the audience was weary of politics now that
Athens was ruled by second-rate men. The general retirement of the
fourth-cen- tury Greek from public to private life inclined his interest
from affairs of state to those of the home and the heart. The comedy of
manners ap- peared; love began to dominate the scene, and not always by
its virtue; the ladies of the demimonde mingled on the boards with
fishwives, cooks, and bewildered philosophers — though the honor of the
protagonists and the dramatist was saved by a marriage at the end. These
plays were not coars- ened by Aristophanes’ vulgarity and burlesque, but
neither were they</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 483</p>
<p>vitalized by his exuberance and his imagination. We know the names,
and have none of the works, of thirty-nine poets of the Middle Comedy;
but we may judge from their fragments that they did not write for the
ages. Alexis of Thurii wrote 245 plays, Antiphanes 260. They made hay
while the sun shone, and died with its setting.</p>
<p>It was a century of orators. The rise of industry and trade turned
men’s minds to realism and practicality, and the schools that once had
taught the poems of Homer now trained their pupils in rhetoric. Isaeus,
Lycurgus, Hypereides, Demades, Deinarchus, Aeschines, Demosthenes were
orator- politicians, leaders of political factions, masters of what the
Germans have called the Advokatenrepublik. Similar men appeared in the
democratic interludes of Syracuse; the oligarchic states did not suffer
them. The Athenian orators were clear and vigorous in language, averse
to ornate eloquence, capable, now and then, of noble patriotic flights,
and given to such dishonesty of argument and abusiveness of speech as
would not be tolerated even in a modern campaign. The heterogeneous
quality of the Athenian Assembly and the popular courts had a debasing
as well as a stimulating effect upon Greek oratory, and through it upon
Greek litera- ture. The Athenian citizen enjoyed bouts of oratorical
invective almost as much as he enjoyed a prize fight; when a duel was
expected between such word warriors as Aeschines and Demosthenes, men
came froms dis- tant villages and foreign states to hear them. Often the
appeal was to prido and prejudice; Plato, who hated oratory as the
poison that was killing democracy, defined rhetoric as the art of
governing men by addressing their feelings and passions.</p>
<p>Even Demosthenes, with all his vigor and nervous intensity, his
frequent ascent to passages of patriotic fervor, his withering fire of
personal attack, his clever and relieving alternation of narrative and
argument, the care- fully rhythmic quality of his language, and the
overwhelming torrent of his speech — even Demosthenes strikes us as a
little less than great. He laid the secret of oratory in acting
(hypocrisis) , and so believed this that he rehearsed his speeches
patiently, and recited them before a mirror. He dug himself a cave and
lived in it for months, practicing secretly; in these periods he kept
one half of his face shaved to deter himself from leaving his retreat.’
On the rostrum he contorted his figure, whirled round and round, laid
his hand upon his forehead as in reflection, and often raised his voice
to a scream.’ All this, says Plutarch, “was wonderfully pleasing to the
common people, but by well-educated persons, as, for example, by
Ekmetrius of Phalerum, it was looked upon as mean, humiliating, and</p>
<p>484 THE LIFE OF GREECE (cHAP.</p>
<p>XXunmanly.” We are amused by Demosthenes’ histrionics, amazed by his
self-esteem, confused by his digressions, and appalled by his ungracious
scurrility. There is little wit in him, little philosophy. Only his
patriotism redeems him, and the apparent sincerity of his despairing cry
for freedom.</p>
<p>The historic climax of Greek oratory came in 330. Six years
before,</p>
<p>Ctesiphon had carried through the Council a preliminary proposal to
award Demosthenes a crown or wreath in appreciation not only of his
states- manship but of his many financial gifts to the state. To keep
this honor from has rival, Aeschines indicted Ctesiphon on the ground
(technically correct) of having introduced an unconstitutional proposal.
The case of Ctesiphon, repeatedly postponed, finally came to trial
before a jury of five hundred citizens. It was, of course, a cause
cSUbre; all who could came, even from afar, to hear it; for in effect
the greatest of Athenian orators was fighting for his good name and his
political life. Aeschines spent little time attacking Ctesiphon, but
turned his assault upon the character and career of Demosthenes, who
replied in kind with his famous speech On the Crown. Every line of the
two orations still vibrates with excitement, and is hot with the hatred
of enemies brought face to face in war. Demosthenes, knowing that
offense is better than defense, charged that Philip had chosen the most
corruptible of the orators as his mouthpieces in Athens. Then he etched
in add a life portrait of Aeschines:</p>
<p>I must let you know who this man really is who embarks upon</p>
<p>vituperation so glibly… and what is his parentage. Virtue? You</p>
<p>renegade! — what have you or your family to do with virtue?…</p>
<p>Where did you get your right to talk about education?… Shall</p>
<p>I relate how your father was a slave who kept an elementary school
near the Temple of Theseus, and how he wore shackles on his legs</p>
<p>and a timber collar round his neck, or how your mother practiced</p>
<p>daylight nuptials in an outhouse?… You helped your father in</p>
<p>he dradgery of a grammar school, grinding the ink, sponging the</p>
<p>benches, sweeping the room, holding the position of a menial….</p>
<p>After getting yourself enrolled on the register of your parish —
no</p>
<p>one knows how you managed it, but let that pass — you chose a most
gentlemanly occupation, that of clerk and errand-boy to minor</p>
<p>o fficial s. After committing all the offenses with which you
reproach other people, you were relieved of that employment…. You
en-</p>
<p>ered rihe service of those famous players, Simylus and Socrates, bet-
ter known as the Growlers. You played small parts to their lead,</p>
<p>picTfing up figs and grapes and olives, and maldng a better
living</p>
<p>out of those missiles than by all the battles you fought for dear
life.</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY</p>
<p>For there was no truce or armistice in the warfare between you</p>
<p>and your audience….</p>
<p>Compare, then, Aeschines, your life and mine. You taught read-</p>
<p>ing, I attended school. You danced, I was choragus…. You were</p>
<p>a public scribe, I a public orator. You were a third-rate actor,
I</p>
<p>a spectator at the play. You failed in your part, and I hissed
you.“</p>
<p>It was a powerful speech; not a model of order and courtesy, but so
eloquent with passion that the jury acquitted Ctesiphon by a vote of
five to one. In the following year the Assembly voted Demosthenes the
dis- puted crown. Aeschines, unable to pay the fine that was
automatically levied upon so unsuccessful a persecution, fled to Rhodes,
where he made a precarious living by teaching rhetoric. An old tradition
says that Demos- thenes sent him money to alleviate his poverty.*</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>ISOCRATES</li>
</ol>
<p>This duel of oratory has been loudly lauded and devoutly studied in
every generation. But in truth it represents almost the nadir of
Athenian politics; we cannot see nobility in this street-corner contest
in vituperation, this mean quarrel for public praise between two secret
recipients of foreign gold. Isocrates is a little more attractive, and
carries down into the fourth century something of the grandeur of the
fifth. Born in 436, he lived till 338, and died with Greek liberty. His
father had made a fortune by manufacturing flutes; he gave his son every
educational advantage, even sending him to study rhetoric with Gorgias
in Thessaly. The Peloponnesian War, and the example of Alcibi- ades,
ruined the flute business, and destroyed the family fortune; Isocrates
had to go forth and earn his living by the sweat of his pen. He began by
writing speeches for others, and thought of becoming an orator. But he
suffered from shyness and a weak voice, and a strong distaste for the
crudities of political strife. He abominated the demagogues who had
captured the Assembly, and shrank for a time into a quiet pedagogic
life.</p>
<p>In 391 he opened the most successful of Athenian schools of rhetoric.
Stu- dents came to him from all the Greek world; perhaps their variety
of origin and outlook helped to form his Panhellenic philosophy. He
thought that all other teachers were on the wrong track. In a pamphlet
Against the Sophists he denounced both those who professed to turn any
numbskull into a pundit for three or four minas, and those who, like
Plato, hoped to prepare men for government by training them in science
and metaphysics. As for himself, he admitted that he could get results
only when the student possessed some natural talent. He would not teach
metaphysics or science, for these, he argued, were</p>
<p>486 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhopeless inquiries into insoluble mysteries. Nevertheless, he gave
the name of philosophy to the instruction provided in his school. The
curriculum centered upon the arts of writing and speaking, but these
were taught in connection with literature and politics;® Isocrates
offered, as we should say, a cultural course as opposed to the
mathematical course given in Plato’s Academy. The art of speech was the
goal, as being then the chief medium of public advancement; the Athenian
state was governed by argument. So Isocrates taught his pupils the use
of words: how to arrange them in the clearest order, in rhythmic but not
metrical sequence, in polished but not ornate diction, in smooth
transitions of sound and thought,* in balanced clauses and cumulative
periods; such prose, he believed, would please the refined ear as much
as poetry. Out of this school came many leaders of the Demosthenic age:
Timotheus the general, Ephorus and Theopompus the historians, Isaeus,
Lycurgus, Hypereides, and Aeschines the orators, Speusippus the
successor of Plato, and, some say, Aris- totle himself.®</p>
<p>Isocrates was not content with forming great men; he wished to play
some part in the affairs of his time. Unable to be either an orator or a
statesman, he became a pamphleteer. He addressed long speeches to the
Athenian public, to leaders like Philip, or to the assembled Greeks at
the PanheRenic games; in- stead of delivering these he published them,
and thereby unconsciously invented the essay as a literary form.
Twenty-nine of his discourses remain, and rank among the most
interesting survivals of Greek antiquity. His first great pro-
nouncement, the PanegyricuSyf struck the theme of all his thought — the
theme of his old master Gorgias — a call to Greece to forget its little
sovereignties, and become a state. Isocrates was a proud Athenian — “So
far has our city distanced the rest of mankind in thought and speech
that her pupils have become the teachers of all the world.” But he was a
prouder Greek; to him, as to the Hellenistic age, Hellenism meant not
membership in a race, but participation in a culture; and that culture,
he felt, was the finest that men had yet created anywhere.’ But all
around this culture were “barbarians”— in Italy, Sicily, Africa, Asia,
and what we should now call the Balkans. It saddened him to see the
barbarians becoming stronger, and Persia consolidating her control of
fonia, while the Greek states consumed themselves in civil war.</p>
<p>For many as are the ills that are incident to the nature of man,</p>
<p>we have ourselves invented more than those that nature lays upon</p>
<p>us, by engendering wars and factions among ourselves…. Against</p>
<p>hese ills no one has ever protested; and people are not ashamed to
weep over the calamities that have been fabricated by the poets,</p>
<p>• E.g., Isocrates— and most Greek writers after him — counted it a
literary sin to end one word, and begin the next, with a vowel.</p>
<p>So named because addressed to the panegyris, or General Assembly
(pan-agora) of the Greeks, at the hundredth Olympiad.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY</p>
<p>while they view complacently the real sufferings, the many
terrible</p>
<p>sufferings, that result from our state of war; and they are so
far</p>
<p>from feeling pity t hat they even rejoice more in each other’s sor
-</p>
<p>rows than in their own blessings.®</p>
<p>If the Greeks must fight, why not fight a real enemy? Why not drive
the Persians back to their plateau? A small detachment of Greeks, he
prophesied, would defeat a large army of Persians.® Such a holy war
might at last give unity to Greece; and the choice was between Greek
unity or triumphant barbarism.</p>
<p>Two years arter publishing this appeal (378) Isocrates, turning
theory into practice, toured the Aegean with his ex-pupil Timotheus, and
helped to for- mulate the tern &gt; of the second Athenian Confederacy.
The rise and fall of this new hope of u - :xy formed one more
disappointment in his long life. In a brave a!.d vigorous pamphlet Oit
the Peace he condemned Athens for again corrupt- ing an alliance into an
empire, and called upon her to sign a peace that would assure every
Greek state against Athenian encroachments. “What we call em - pire is
in reality misfortune, for by its very nature it depraves all who have
to do with it.”“ Imperialism, he said, had ruined democracy by teaching
Athenians to live on foreign tribute; losing that, they now wished to
live on state contri- butions, and exalted to the highest offices those
who promised them most. Whenever you deliberate on the business of the
state you dis-</p>
<p>rust and dislike men of superior intelligence, and cultivate in-</p>
<p>stead the most depraved of the orators who come before you; you</p>
<p>prefer… those who are drunk to those who are sober, those who</p>
<p>are witless to those who are wise, and those who dole out the public
money to those who perform public services at their own expense.^</p>
<p>In his next address, the Areopagiticus, he spoke more leniently of
democracy. “We sit around in our shops denouncing the present order,”
says a timeless pas - sage, “but we perceive that even badly constituted
democracies are responsible for fewer disasters than are oligarchies.
Had not Sparta made a worse mis- tress for Greece than Athens had been?
— and, “Have not we all o f us, because of the madness of the Thirty,
become greater enthusiasts for democracy than those who occupied
Phyle?”<em>‘^ But Athens had ruined itself by carrying to excess the
principles of liberty and equality, by “training the citizens in such
fashion that they looked upon insolence as democracy, lawlessness as
liberty, impudence of speech as equality, and license to do what they
pleased as hap- piness.”’</em> All men are not equal, and should not be
equally free to hold office. The institution of the lot, Isocrates felt,
had lowered disastrously the level of Athenian statesmanship. Better
than this “mob rule” was the “timocracy” of Solon and Cleisthenes; for
then amiable ignorance and eloquent venality had</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXless chance of being raised to leadership; able men rose naturally
to the top, and the Areopagus, receiving them after their term of
office, became auto- matically the mature brain of the state.</p>
<p>In 346, when Athens came to terms with Philip, Isocrates, now ninety,
ad- dressed an open letter to the Macedonian King. He foresaw that
Philip would make himself master of Greece, and begged him to use his
power not as a ty- rant, but as the unifier of autonomous Greek states
in a war for the liberation of Greece from the King’s Peace, and of
Ionia from Persian rule. The war party denounced the letter as a
surrender to despotism, and for seven years Isocrates held his pen. He
spoke once more in 339, addressing his pamphlet to the Greeks who were
gathering for the Panathenaic games. The Panathe- naicus is a weak and
prolix repetition of the Panegyricus; the style trembles in the old
man’s hand; but it is an astonishing performance for one who was only
three years short of a century. Then in 338 came Chaeronea; Athens was
de- feated, but Isocrates’ dream of a unified Greece was about to come
true. A late Greek tradition says that when the news came he forgot
about Philip and unity, and thought only of his native city humiliated,
the days of her glory ended; and that, at the age of ninety-eight,
having at last lived long enough, he starved himself to death.“ We do
not know if this is true; but Aristotle tells us that within five days
after Chaeronea, Isocrates was dead.</p>
<p>HI. XENOPHON</p>
<p>The influence of “the old man eloquent”^ upon the statesmen of his
time is open to doubt, but his influence upon letters was immediate and
enduring.* It was felt first by the historians. Xenophon and others
imitated his sketch of Evagoras,t and biography became a popular form of
Greek literature, cul- minating in the gossipy masterpieces of Plutarch.
To one of his pupils, Ephorus of Cyme, Isocrates committed the task of
writing a general history of Greece — a record not of any one state, but
of Greece as a whole. Ephorus carried out the assignment so well that
his contemporaries ranked his Universal History with the books of
Herodotus. To another pupil, Theopompus of Chios, Isocrates committed
the field of recent events; Theopompus covered it in his Hellenica and
Philippica, lively and rhetorical works highly praised by his
contemporaries. About 340 Dicaearchus of Messana wrote a history of
Greek civilization under the title of Bios Hellados — The Life of
Greece; so ancient is our present enter- prise, even, by chance, to its
name.</p>
<p>• Cicero, Milton, Massillon, Jeremy Taylor, and Edmund Burke formed
their prose style upon the balanced clauses and long periods of
Isocrates,</p>
<p>The enlightened dictator who had imported Greek culture into Cyprus,
410-387.</p>
<p>CHAP.XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 489</p>
<p>The only one of the fourth-century historians who has survived is
Xeno- phon. Diogenes Laertius describes him in his youth:</p>
<p>Xenophon was a man of great modesty, and as handsome as can</p>
<p>be imagined. They say that Socrates met him in a narrow lane, and</p>
<p>put his stick across it, and prevented him from passing by,
asking</p>
<p>where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And when Xenophon</p>
<p>had answered him, he asked, again, where men were made good and
virtuous. And as Xenophon did not know, Socrates said, “Follow</p>
<p>me, then, and learn.” And from that time forth Xenophon became</p>
<p>a follower of Socrates.”</p>
<p>He was among the more practical of S ocrates’ students. He liked his
master’s fascinating sleight - o’ -mind, and loved him as a philosophic
saint. But he enjoyed action as well as thought, and became a soldier of
fortune while some other scholars, as Aristophanes disdainfully put it,
were “m eas- uring the air.”“ About the age of thirty he took service
under the younger Cyrus, fought at Cunaxa, and led the Ten Thousand to
safety. At Byzan- tium he joined the Spartans in their war against
Persia, captured a wealthy Mede, accepted a rich ransom for him, and
lived on it for the rest of his life. He became a friend and admirer of
the Spartan King Agesilaus, and made him the subject of a worshipful
biography. Returning to Greece with Agesilaus after Athens had declared
war upon Sparta, he chose to be loyal to him rather than to his city;
whereupon Athens decreed him an exile, and confiscated his property. He
fought on the side of the Lacedaemonians at Coronea, and received as a
reward an estate at Scillus in Elis, then under Spartan domination.
There he spent twenty years as a country gentle- man, farming, hunting,
writing, and bringing up his sons sternly on the Spartan plan.“</p>
<p>To his banishment we owe the varied works that lifted him to the
front rank among the authors of his time. He wrote as his mood inclined
him, about breaking in dogs, managing horses, training a wife, educating
princes, fighting with Agesilaus, or raising revenues for Athens. In the
ATiabasis, with the fresh style of one who had seen or done the things
he described, he told the thrilling (but quite uncorroborated) story of
the Ten Thou- sand’s long trek to the sea. In the Hellenica he took up
the history of Greece where Thucydides had left off, and brought it down
to the battle of Mantinea, in which his own son Gryllus died fighting
bravely after slay- ing Epaminondas. The book is a dreary chronicle, in
which history is con- ceived as an endless chain of battles, a vain
logic-chopping alternation of victory and defeat. The style is lively,
the character sketches are vivid; but</p>

<p>XXhe facts are judiciously chosen to prove the superiority of Spartan
ways. Superstition, which disappeared from history in Thucydides,
returns with Xenophon, and supernatural agency is invoked to explain the
trajectory of events. With like simplicity or duplicity, the Memorabilia
transforms Soc- rates into a monster of perfection, orthodox in
religion, in ethics, in gender- less love, in everything except that
scorn for democracy which particularly endeared him to the banished and
Laconizing Xenophon. Still more unre- liable is the Banquet, which
reports conversations alleged to have occurred when Xenophon was a
child.</p>
<p>In the Oeconomicus, however, Xenophon speaks in his own right, and
with such frank conservatism that we are charmed despite ourselves.
Asked for instruction in agriculture, Socrates modestly confesses his
ignorance, but recalls the advice and example of the rich landowner
Ischomachus. The latter voices the knightly Xenophon’s disdain for any
occupation except husbandry and war. He expounds not only the secrets of
successful tillage, but the art of managing one’s property and one’s
wife. In pages that for a moment rival the grace of Plato, Ischomachus
tells how he taught his bride — only half his age — the business of
caring for the home, keeping all things in place, governing her servants
with kindness but without familiar- ity, and building a good name for
herself not through artificial beauty but through a faithful performance
of her obligations as -wife, mother, and friend. In the view of
Ischomachus-Xenophon marriage is an economic as well as a physical
association, and decays when the silent partner does all the work.
Perhaps the readiness with which the young bride accepts all this is
merely the devout wish of a general who won no victories on the domestic
battlefield; but we should be willing to believe everything in the
account except the tale of how Ischomachus, with but a moment’s reason -
ing, per suaded his wife to abandon powder and rouge.”</p>
<p>Having expounded the art of marriage, Xenophon describes in the Cyro-
paedia (i.e.. The Education of Cyrus) his ideals of schooling and
govern- ment, as if in answer to Plato’s Republic. Cleverly adapting f
ictitious biog- raphy to the uses of philosophy, he gives an imaginary
account of the training, career, and administration of Cyrus the Great.
He makes the story dramatically personal, enlivens it with dialogue, and
decorates it with the oldest romantic love story in extant literature.
He almost ignores cultural education, and concentrates upon making the
boy a healthy, able, and honorable man; the youth learns the virile
sports, the arts of war, the habit of silent obedience, and finally the
capacity for effective and persuasive command over subordinates. The
best government, Xenophon thinks, is</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 491</p>
<p>an enlightened monarchy supported and checked by an aristocracy de-
voted to agricultural and military pursuits. He admires the laws of
Persia for rewarding good as well as punishing evil,“ and points out to
the in- dividualistic Greeks, from the example of Persia, the
possibility of uniting many cities and states in an empire enjoying
internal order and peace. Xenophon began, like Philip, with a vision of
conquest; he ends, like Alex- ander, captivated by the people whom he
thought to conquer.</p>
<p>He is a masterly storyteller, but a middling philosopher. He is an
ama- teur in everything but war; he considers a hundred subjects, but
always from the viewpoint of a general. He exaggerates the virtues of
order and has not a word to say for liberty; we may Judge from this how
far disorder had gone in Athens. If antiquity ranked him with Herodotus
and Thucyd- ides it must have been because of his style — the fresh
charm of its Attic purity, the harmonious flow of a prose that Cicero
called “sweeter than honey,”“ the human touches of personality, the
transparent simplicity of language that allows the reader to see through
the clear medium the thought or subject in hand. Xenophon and Plato
stand to Thucydides and Socrates in the same relation as Apelles and
Praxiteles to Polygnotus and Pheidias — the culmination of artistry and
grace after an age of creative originality and power.</p>

<li>APELLES</li>

<p>The highest excellence of the fourth century lay not in literature
but in philosophy and art. In art, as in politics, the individual
liberated himself from the temple, the state, the tradition, and the
school. As patriotic devotion yielded to private loyalties, architecture
took on a more modest scale, and became increasingly secular; the great
choral forms of music and dance made way for private performances by
professionals; painting and sculpture continued to adorn public
buildings with the representation of gods or noble human types, but at
the same time they entered upon that service and portrayal of liv ing
individuals which characterized the succeeding age. Where cities could
still afford to patronize art on a national scale it was because — like
Cnidus, Hali- carnassus, or Ephesus — they had not been deeply touched
by war, or, like Syracuse, had found in natural resources and
governmental order the means of a rapid recovery.</p>
<p>On the mainland architecture marked time. In 338 Lycurgus rebuilt the
Theater of Dionysus, the Stadium, and the Lyceum; and under his adminis-
tration Philon raised an impressive arsenal at the Piraeus. As the
tendency to a delicate refinement increased, the Doric order became less
fashionable, it?</p>
<p>49* THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXStem simplicity finding no counterpart in the soul; the Ionic style
rose in popularity, and served as an architectural analogue to
Praxiteles’ elegance and Plato’s charm; while the C orinthian order made
modest conquests in the Tower of the Winds and the choragic monument of
Lysicrates. At Arcadian Tegea Scopas raised a temple of Athena in all
three styles — one colonnade Doric, another Ionic, another Corinthian^ —
and beautified it with statuary from his own masculine hand.</p>
<p>Vaster and more famous was the third temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
The second temple had burned down on the day of Alexander’s birth in
356, a coin - cidence which, says the usually kindly Plutarch, Hegesias
of Magnesia “made the occasion of a conceit frigid enough to have
stopped the conflagration.”®* The new building was begun soon afterward,
and was completed by the end of the century. Alexander offered to bear
the whole cost of the work if his name as donor were recorded on the
edifice; but the proud Greeks of Ephesus refused for the disarming (or
possibly satirical) reason that “it was not meet</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme of size the fourth century distinguished
itself in terra-cotta statuettes. Boeotian Tanagra made its name
synonymous with little figures in baked and unglazed clay, cast in
generalized types but then molded and painted by hand into a thousand
individual shapes quick with the color and variety of common life. As in
earlier centuries, painting was called in to aid other arts; but now it
acquired an independent status and dignity, and its mas- ters received
commissions from all the Greek world. Pamphilus of Amphipolis, who
taught Apelles, refused to take any pupil for less than twelve years,
and charged 000 for the course. Mnason, dictator of Locrian Elatea, paid
ten minas for each of the hundred figures in a battle scene by Aristides
of Thebes, making 00,000 for one painting; and the same enthusiast gave
Asclepiodoros 60,000 for a panel of the twelve major Olympians. Lucullus
paid 2,000 for a copy of portrait that Pausias of Sicyon had painted of
Menander’s mistress Glycera.“ A picture by Apelles, says Pliny, sold for
a sum equal to the treasuries of whole cities.“</p>
<p>’’Apelles of Cos,” says the same enthusiastic amateur, “surpassed all
the other painters who either preceded or succeeded him. Singlehanded,
he</p>
<p>CHAP.XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 493</p>
<p>contributed more to painting than all the others together.’”® Apelles
must have been supreme in his day and art, since he could afford the
rare extrava- gance of praising other painters. Learning that his
greatest rival, Protog- enes, was living in poverty, Apelles sailed for
Rhodes to visit him. Pro- togenes, unwarned, was not in his studio when
Apelles came. An old woman attendant asked Apelles whom she should name
as visitor when her master returned. Apelles replied only by taking a
brush and tracing upon a panel, with one stroke, an outline of exceeding
fineness. When Protogenes came back the old woman regretted that she
could not tell him the name of his departed visitor; but Protogenes,
seeing the outline and noting its deli- cacy, exclaimed: “Only Apelles
could have drawn that line.” Then he</p>
<p>drew a still finer line within that of Apelles, and bade the woman
show it if the stranger should return. Apelles came, marveled at the
absent; Protog- enes’ skill , but drew, between the two lines, a third
of such slenderness and grace that when Protogenes saw it he confessed
himself surpassed, and rushed to the harbor to detain and welcome
Apelles. The panel was trans- mitted as a masterpiece from generation to
generation, until it was bought by Julius Caesar and perished in the
fire that destroyed his palace on the Palatine Hill. Anxious to awaken
the Greek world to Protogenes’ worth, Apelles asked him what he wanted
for some of his paintings; Protogenes mentioned a modest sum, but
Apelles offered him, instead, fifty talents (00,000), and then
circulated a report that he intended to sell these works as his own. The
Rhodians, aroused to a better appreciation of their artist, paid
Protogenes more than the sum Apelles had named, and kept the pic- tures
among the public treasures of the city.”</p>
<p>Apelles meanwhile had captured the plaudits of the Greek world by his
painting of Aphrodite Anadyomene — .andandandand., Aphrodite rising from
the sea. Alexander sent for him, and sat for many portraits. The young
conqueror was not satisfied with the representation of his horse
Bucephalus in one of these pictures, and had the animal brought closer
to the panel for compari- son. Bucephalus, looking at the picture,
whinnied; whereupon Apelles remarked, “Your Majesty’s horse seems to
know more about painting than you do.”” On another occasion, when the
King was holding forth about art in Apelles’ studio, Apelles begged him
to talk of anything else, lest the boys who were grinding the colors
should laugh at him. Alexander took it good-naturedly; and when he
engaged the artist to paint his favorite con- cubine, and Apelles fell
in love with her, the King sent her to him as a gift.“ — Over his
finished pictures Apelles painted a thin coat of varnish, which
preserved the colors, softened their glare, and yet made them livelier
than</p>

<p>XXbefore. He worked to the last, and death came upon him while he was
once more delineating the eternal Aphrodite.</p>
<p>V. PRAXITELES</p>
<p>The sculptural masterpiece of the period was the great mausoleum
dedi- cated to King Mausolus of Halicarnassus. Nominally a satrap of
Persia, Mausolus had extended his personal sway over Caria and parts of
Ionia and Lycia, and had used his rich revenues to build a fleet and
beautify his capi- tal. When he died (353), his devoted sister and wife,
Artemisia, held a famous oratorical contest in his honor, and summoned
the best artists of Greece to collaborate upon a tomb that should be a
fitting memorial to his genius. She was a queen by nature as well as by
marriage; when the Rho- dians took advantage of the King’s death to
invade Caria, she ‘defeated them by clever strategy, captured their
fleet and their capital, and soon brought the rich merchants to terms.”
But her grief over the death of Mausolus weakened her, and she died two
years after him, before she could see the completed monument that was to
give a word to every Western tongue. Slowly Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis,
and Timotheus raised a rectangular tomb of white marble slabs over a
base of bricks, covered it with a pyram- idal roof, and adorned it with
thirty-six columns and a wealth of statu- ary and reliefs. A statue of
Mausolus,* calm and strong, was found among the ruins of Halicarnassus
by the English in 1857. Still more finished in workmanship is a frieze*
showing again the struggle of Greeks and Ama- zons. These men, women,
and horses are among the chejs- d’ oeuvres of the world’s bas -;reliefs.
The Amazons are not masculine females built for battle; they are women
of a voluptuous beauty that should have tempted the Greeks to something
gentler than war. The Mausoleum took its place, with the third temple at
Ephesus, among the Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
<p>In many respects sculpture now reached its apogee. It lacked the
stimu- lus of religion, and fell short of the majestic power of the
Parthenon pedi- ments; but it took a new inspiration from feminine
grace, and achieved a loveliness never equaled before or since. The
fifth century had modeled nude men and draped women; the fourth
preferred to carve nude women and clothed men. The fifth century had
idealized its types, and had cast or chiseled the harassed life of man
into an emotionless repose; the fourth century tried tc realize in stone
something of human individuality and</p>

</ul>

<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY</p>
<p>feeling. In male statuary the head and face took on more importance,
the body less; the study of character replaced the idolatry of muscle;
portraits in stone became the fashion for any subject who could pay. The
body abandoned its stiff, straight pose, and leaned at ease upon a stick
or tree; and the surface was modeled to let in the living play of light
and shade. Anxious for realism, Lysistratus of Sicyon, apparently first
among the Greeks, fitted a plaster mold upon the subject’s face, and
made a preliminary cast.”</p>
<p>The representation of sensuous beauty and grace came to perfection in
Praxiteles. All the world knows that he courted Phryne, and gave a
lasting form to her loveliness, but no one knows when he was born or
when he died. He was both the son and father of sculptors named
Cephisodotus, so that we picture him as the climax of a family tradition
of patient artistry. He worked in bronze as well as marble, and won such
repute that a dozen cities competed for his services. About 360 Cos
commissioned him to carve an Aphrodite; with Phryne’s help he did, but
th e Coans were scandalized to find the goddess quite nude. Praxiteles
mollified them by making an- other Aphrodite, clothed, while Cnidus
bought the first. King Nicomedes of Bithynia offered to pay the heavy
public debt of the city in return for the statue, but Cnidus preferred
immortality. Tourists came from every nook of the Mediterranean to see
the work; critics pronounced it the finest statue yet made in Greece,
and gossip said that men had been stirred to amorous frenzy by viewing
it.*“</p>
<p>As Cnidus achieved fame through the Aphrodite, so the little town of
Thespiae in Boeotia, birthplace of Phryne, attracted travelers because
Phryne had dedicated there a marble Eros by Praxiteles. For she had
asked of him, as a proof of his love, the most beautiful of the works in
his studio. He wished to leave the choice to her; but Phryne, hoping to
discover his own estimate, ran to him one day with news that his studio
was on fire; whereupon he cried out, “I am lost if my Satyr and my Eros
are burned.”” Phryne chose the Eros, and gave it to her native town.f
Eros, once the cre- ator god of Hesiod, became in Praxiteles’ conception
a delicate and dreamy youth, symbolizing the power of love to capture
the soul; he had not yet become the mischievous and sportive Cupid of
Hellenistic and Roman art.</p>

<p>XXas Hawthorne’s Marble Faun, is a copy of the work that Praxiteles
pre - ferred to his Eros. Some have thought that a torso in the Louvre
is part of the original itself.” The satyr is represented as a well
-formed and happy lad, whose only animal element is his long and pointed
ears. He is resting lazily against a tree trunk, with one foot crossed
behind the other. Seldom has marble conveyed so fully the sense of idle
ease; all the charming care- lessness of boyhood is in the relaxed limbs
and trustful face. Perhaps the limbs are too rounded and soft;
Praxiteles looked too long at Phryne to be able to model a man. The
Apollo Sauroctonus — Apollo the Lizard-Killer — is so feminine that we
are half inclined to class him with the hermaphrodites that abound in
Hellenistic statuary.</p>
<p>Pausanias remarks with regrettable brevity that among the statues in
the Heraeum at Ol ympia was “a stone Hermes carrying Dionysus as a babe,
by Praxiteles.”” German excavators digging on the site in 1877 crowned
their labors by finding this figure, buried under centuries of rub- bish
and clay. Descriptions, photographs, and casts miss the quality of the
work; one must stand before it in the little museum at Olympia, and
clandestinely pass the fingers over its surface, to realize the smooth
and living texture of this marble flesh. The messenger god has been
entrusted with the task of rescuing the infant Dionysus from the
jealousy of Hera, and taking him to the nymphs who are to rear him in
secret. Hermes pauses on the way, leans against a tree, and holds up a
cluster of grapes before the child. The infant is crudely done, as if
the inspiration of the artist had been exhausted on the older god. The
right arm of the Hermes is gone, and parts of the legs have been
restored; the remainder is appar- ently as it came from the sculptor’s
hand. The firm limbs and broad chest show a healthy physical
development; the head is in itself a masterpiece, with its aristocratic
shapeliness, its chiseled refinement of features, and its curly hair;
and the right foot is perfect where perfection in statuary is rare.
Antiquity considered this a minor work; we may judge from this the
artistic wealth of the age.</p>
<p>Another passage in Pausanias” describes a marble group set up by
Praxit - eles in Mantinea. Excavation has found the base alone, bearing
the figures of three Muses, carved probably by the pupils rather than by
the master. If we put together the references in extant Greek writings
to statues by Praxiteles, we find some forty major works;” and these
were doubtless but a part of his abundant production. We miss in the
remains the sublimity and strength, the dignity and reverence of
Pheidias; the gods have made way for Phryne, and the great issues of
national life have been put aside</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LETTERS AND ARTS IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 497</p>
<p>for private love. But no sculptor has ever surpassed the sureness of
Praxit- eles’ technique, the almost miraculous power to pour into hard
stone ease and grace and the tenderest sentiment, sensuous delight and
woodland joyousness. Pheidias was Doric, Praxiteles is Ionic; in him
again we have a premonition of that cultural conquest of Europe which
was to follow Alexander’s victories.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>SCOPAS AND LYSIPPUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Scopas played Byron to Pheidias’ Milton and Praxiteles’ Keats. We
know nothing about his life except through his works, which are the real
biography of any man; but even of his works we know none with certainty.
The stocky and pugnacious heads of the statues that are attributed to
him, or of the copies that are ascribed to his originals, stamp him as a
man of passionate individuality and force. At Tegea, as we have seen, he
served as both archi- tect and sculptor, showing a versatility and power
unsurpassed in all the cen- turies between Pheidias and Michelangelo.
Excavations have found only a few fragments of a pediment, chiefly two
badly damaged heads marked by a brachy- cephalic roundness, and a moody
distant look, which are typical of Scopas’ work; together with a
battered and masculine figure of Atalanta. Strangely like these remains
is the Meleager head in the Villa Medici at Rome; here again are the
full cheeks, the sensual lips, the brooding eyes, the slightly
projecting ridge of the forehead above the nose, and the half-disheveled
curly hair; perhaps it is a Roman copy of a Meleager set up by Scopas as
part of a group represent- ing the Calydonian hunt. Another head, in the
Metropolitan Museum at New York, is almost surely by Scopas, or copied
from him; blunt and powerful, and yet handsome and intelligent, it is
one of the most characterful remains of ancient statuary.</p>
<p>At Elis, says Pausanias,“ Scopas cast “a brazen statue of the
Pandemian Aphrodite sitting on a brazen he- goat.” At Sicyon he made a
marble Heracles^ of which, perhaps, we have a Roman copy in the
Lansdowne House at London: the body a relapse into Polycleitan stylized
musculature, the head small and round_as-usual, the face almost as
refined as in Praxiteles. He paused long enough at Megara, Argos,
Thebes, and Athens to make statues that Pausanias saw there five
centuries later; and perhaps he had a hand in rebuilding the sanc- tuary
at Epidaurus. Crossing the Aegean, he made an Athena and a Dionysus for
Cnidus, and played a major role in the sculptures of the Mausoleum.
Going north, he carved one of the column drums of the third temple at
Ephesus. At Pergamum he made a colossal seated Ares; at Chrysa in the
Troad he set up an Apollo Smintheus to scare mice from the fields. He
contributed to the fame</p>
<p>49® the life of GREECE (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXof Samothrace with an Aphrodite; and in far-off Byzantium he carved
a Bac- chante of which the Dresden Albertinum may have a Roman copy in
the Raging Maenad, This marble statuette, though only eighteen inches
high, is worthy of a great artist — powerful in figure, magnificent in
drapery, unique in pose, alive with anger, and beautiful from every
side. Pliny refers to many other statues by Scopas, which in his day
stood in the palaces of Rome: an Apollo probably copied in the Apollo
Citharoedus of the Vatican; a group of Poseidon, Thetis, Achilles, and
Nereids, “an admirable piece of workmanship,” says Pliny, “even if it
had taken a whole life to complete it”; and a “naked Aphrodite,
sufiicient to establish the renown of any city.”^</p>
<p>All in all, these works, if a judgment may be based upon a few
hypothetical survivals, suggest for Scopas a rank very near to
Praxiteles. Here is originality without extravagance, strength without
brutality, and a dramatic portrayal of impulse, emotion, and mood,
without disfigurement by any strained intensity. Praxiteles loved
beauty, Scopas was drawn to character; Praxiteles wished to reveal the
grace and tenderness of womanhood, the buoyant health and gaiety of
youth; Scopas chose to portray the pains and tragedies of life, and
ennobled them with artistic representation. Perhaps, if we had more of
his works, we should place him second only to Pheidias.</p>
<p>Lysippus of Sicyon began as a humble artisan in brass. He longed to
be an artist, but could not afford a teacher; he took courage, however,
when he heard Eupompus the painter announce that for his part he would
imitate nature her- self, not any artist.“ Lysippus thereupon turned his
face to the study of living beings, and formed a new canon of sculptural
proportions to replace the stem rule of Polycleitus; he made the legs
longer and the head shorter, extended the limbs into the third
dimension, and gave the figure more vitality and ease. His Apoxyomenos
is a vagrant son of the Diadumenos; Polycleitus’ athlete bound a fillet
above his brow, Lysippus’ scrapes the oil a nd dust from his arm with a
bronze strigil, and achieves a greater slenderness and grace. More
attractive and alive, if we judge from the marble copy in the Delphi
Museum, was his portrait of Agias, a young Thessalian nobleman. Once
free, Lysippus struck out into new fields, abandoning the type for the
individual, the conventional for the impressionistic,* and almost
creating portrait sculpture among the Greeks. Philip interrupted his
wars and amours to sit for Lysippus; Alexander was so pleased with the
artist’s busts of him that he made him the oflicial royal sculptor, as
he had given the exclusive right to Apelles to paint his likeness, and
to Pyrgoteles to engrave it upon gems.</p>

<p>mous: the bronze statue of a youth found in the sea near Marathon, an
ancient copy of a fourth-century Hermes of Andros, and a modest, pen-
sive, delicate Hygiaea found at Tegea* — all three in the Athens Museum;
and in the Boston Museum, from Chios, a profoundly beautiful Head of a
Girl. To this period, so far as we can make out, belong most of the
Niobid figures that came to Rome from Asia Minor in the days of Augus-
tus, and are now scattered among the museums of Europe. And perhaps to
this age must be assigned the originals of three Aphrodites in the
Praxit- elean tradition: the hesitant Venus of Capua in the Naples
Museum, the Vatican’s Crouching Venus, and the modest Venus of Arles in
the Louvre. Greater than these in mature beauty and quiet depth of
feeling is the seated Demeter found at Cnidus in 1858, and now among the
noblest fig- ures in the British Museum. The subject is uncertain;
perhaps it is merely the finest funerary piece that has come down to us
from antiquity; per- haps it represents the com goddess as a mater
dolorosa, silently mourning the rape of Persephone. The emotion is
conveyed with classic restraint; all the tenderness of motherhood, and
its silent resignation, are in the face and eyes. This and the Hermes,
and not those ingratiating Aphrodites, are the living sculptural
masterpieces of fourth-century Greece.</p>
