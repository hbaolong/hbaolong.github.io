<h4 id="chapter-xxxiii-around-the-heartland">CHAPTER XXXIII Around the
Heartland</h4>
<p>1789 — 1812</p>
<p>I. SWITZERLAND</p>
<p>T HIS blessed land felt the tremors of the French upheaval with all
the intimacy of a neighbor. Swiss liberals welcomed the Revolution as an
invitation to Freedom — Johannes von Muller (1752-1809), the most famous
current historian, pronounced July 14, 1789, the best day in the history
of Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. When the Jacobins took
charge he wrote to a friend: “Doubtless you share my regret that in the
National Assembly eloquence is more effective than good sense, and you
may perhaps apprehend that owing to their wish to become too free they
will not become free at all. Yet there will always be something to show,
for these ideas are lodged in every heart.” 1</p>
<p>Frederic-Cesar de La Harpe, who had returned in 1796 to his
native</p>
<p>Switzerland after inoculating Czarevich Alexander with liberalism,
joined with Peter Ochs and other Swiss rebels to form the Helvetic Club,
which labored to overthrow the oligarchies that ruled the cantons.
Napoleon, pass- ing through after his first Italian campaign, noted
these sparks, and advised the Directory that it would find many allies
if it chose to act against the anti- revolutionary activities of French
emigres who were being harbored and helped by the Swiss aristocracy. The
Directory saw the strategic value of Switzerland in the conflict between
France and the German princes; it sent an army into the cantons, annexed
Geneva, deposed the oligarchs, and, with the enthusiastic support of
native revolutionaries, set up the Helvetic Repub- lic under a French
protectorate ( 1798).</p>
<p>The ne w government divided into Jacobin “Patriots,” Moderates, and
Federalists. They quarreled and plotted rival coups d’etat until,
fearing chaos and war, they asked Napoleon (then consul) to give them a
new constitu- tion. In 1801 he sent them the “Constitution of
Malmaison,” which, “in spite of its imperfections, was the best that the
country could hope for at the time,” 2 though it kept Switzerland under
French tutelage. After more in - ternal quarreling the Federalists
overthrew the republican government, organized a new army, and proposed
to renew the oligarchy. Napoleon in- tervened, and sent an army of
thirty thousand men to reestablish French control of Switzerland. The
warring parties again asked Napoleon to me- diate. He formulated an “Act
of Mediation,” which all major factions accepted. It ended the Helvetic
Republic, and initiated the Swiss Confed-</p>
<p>659</p>
<p>66 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>eration essentially as it exists today, except for a continuing
obligation to contribute an annual quota of men to the French Army.
Despite this burden it was a good constitution, 3 and the cantons gave
Napoleon the title of Re- storer of Liberty.</p>
<p>Switzerland, however magnificent its scenery, gave only a small
theater and audience to genius, and several of her authors, artists, and
scientists sought the range and stimulus of larger lands. Johann Fiissli
went to England to paint; Augustin de Candolle (1778-1841) went to
France and advanced the description and classification’ of plants.
Johann Pestalozzi (1746-1827) remained, and caught European attention
for his experiments in education. In 1805 he founded at Yverdun a
boarding school that oper- ated oh the principle that, at least for the
young, ideas have meaning only when connected with concrete objects, and
that the education of children works best through group activities and
recitations. The school drew visiting teachers from a dozen countries,
and influenced primary education in Eu- rope and the United States.
Fichte made it an element in his plan for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Johannes von Muller spent twenty-two years (1786-1808) on his volu-
minous Geschichten Schweitzerischer Eidgenossenschaft, and, even so,
brought this History of the Swiss Confederation only to 1489; but it
remains a classic in both substance and style. Its excellence earned him
the title of the Swiss Tacitus; its idealization of the medieval cantons
shared with martial victories in building up the national pride; and its
story of the legendary William Tell gave Schiller the outline of a
famous play. In 1810, at the age of fifty-eight, Muller began a general
history, Vier und zwanzig Bucher allgemeiner Geschichten. Drawn to
Germany by his readers, he served the Catholic Elector of Mainz, moved
to the Imperial Chancellery in Austria, and ended as the director of
education in Jerome Bonaparte’s Westphalia. When he died Mme. de Stael
wrote of him: “We cannot conceive how the head of one man could contain
such a world of facts and dates…. It seems as if more than one man were
taken from us.” 4</p>
<p>Only next to him in historiographic industry was one of Madame’s</p>
<p>cavalieri serventi, Jean-Charles-Leonard de Sismondi (1773-1842).
Born in Geneva, he fled to England to escape revolutionary violence,
then to Italy, then back to a recalmed Geneva. He met Germaine in 1803,
accompanied her to Italy, and later frequented her salon at nearby
Coppet. Meanwhile he wrote prodigiously, yet with conscientious
scholarship. His sixteen-volume Histoire des republiques italiennes au
moyen age (1809-18) shared in inspir- ing Manzoni, Mazzini, Cavour, and
other leaders of the Risorgimento. For twenty-three years he labored on
his thirty-one-volume Histoire des franpais (182 1-44), which for a time
rivaled Michelet in acclaim.</p>
<p>He visited England again in 1818, and was moved by the mercilessness
of its economy to write and publish (1819) a remarkably prophetic book,
Nouveaux Principes d’economie politique. The basic cause of the
English</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIII ) AROUND THE HEARTLAND 66 1</p>
<p>depression, he argued, was the lag of public purchasing power behind
pro- duction that was rapidly rising with invention; and this lag, he
argued, was due chiefly to underpayment of the workers. Similar crises
of under- consumption would recur as long as the economic system
remained un- changed.</p>
<p>Sismondi’s recommendations were alarmingly radical. The well -being
of the population should be the chief object of government. The laws
against labor unions should be repealed. The workers must be cushioned
against unemployment, and be protected against exploitation. The
interests of the nation or of humanity should not be sacrificed “to th e
simultaneous action of all cupidities;… the rich must be protected
against their own greed.” Despite this pre-Marxian Marxism, Sismondi
rejected socialism (which was then called communism); it would put both
economic and political power into the same hands, and would sacrifice
individual liberty to an omnipotent state. 5</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SWEDEN</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweden could welcome the French Revolution, at least in its early
stages, for throughout the “Swedish Enlightenment” of the eighteenth
century</p>
<p>The reign of Gustavus IV (1792-1809) was unfortunate. He joined the
Third Coalition against France ( 1 805 ) , which gave Napoleon an excuse
for seizing Pomerania and Stralsund — Sweden’s last possessions on the
main - land. In 1808 a Russian army crossed the Gulf of Bothnia on the
ice and threatened Stockholm; Sweden was compelled to cede Finland as
the price of peace. The Riksdag deposed Gustavus IV, restored the power
of the aristocracy, and chose the King’s uncle, then sixty -one, as a
manageable Charles XIII (r. 1809-18). As Charles was childless, an heir
to the throne had to be chosen. The Riksdag asked Napoleon to let one of
his ablest mar- shals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, accept election as
crown prince. Napoleon consented, probably in the hope that Bemadotte’s
wife— who had once been</p>
<p>66 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>Napoleon’s fiancee, and was sister -in-law to Joseph Bonaparte —
would be a pro-French influence in Sweden. So Bernadotte, in 1810,
became Charles John, crown prince.</p>
<p>Within this frame of government the Swedish mind continued to keep
pace with the march of education, science, literature, and art. The
Universi- ties of Uppsala, Abo and Lund were among the best in Europe.
Jons Jakob Berzelius (1779-1848) was one of the founders of modem
chemistry. By the careful examination of some two thousand compounds he
arrived at a table of atomic weights far more accurate than Dalton’s,
and differing only minutely from the table internationally established
in 19 1 7.® He isolated many chemical elements for the first time. He
revised Lavoisier’s system of chemical nomenclature. He made classical
studies in the chemical action of electricity, and developed the
dualistic system which studied elements as electrically positive or
negative in chemical combinations. The textbook which he published in
1808, and the Jahresbericht ( Annual Report ) which he began to issue in
1 8 10, became the gospel of chemists for a generation.</p>
<p>There were so many poets that they divided into two rival schools:
the “Phosphorists,” who took their name from their magazine Phosphorus,
and imported the more mystical elements of German Romanticism; and the
“Gothics,” who strummed their lyres to heroic themes.</p>
<p>Esaias Tegner began his literary career as a Gothic, but as he
developed he so enlarged his scope that he seemed to sum up all the
schools of Swedish poetry. Born in 1782, he was only seven years old
when the greatest phos- phorist of all — the French Revolution — spread
its light and heat through Eu- rope; and he was still but thirty-three
when Napoleon left for St. Helena. Tegner lived another thirty-one
years, but he had already achieved eminence when, in 18 11, the Swedish
Royal Academy awarded him a prize for his poem Svea, which scolded his
contemporaries for their failure to maintain the customs of their
ancestors. He joined the “Gothic Union,” and ridiculed the Phosphorists
as Romantic weaklings. At the age of thirty he became pro- fessor of
Greek at the University of Lund; at forty-two he was made bishop of
Vaxjo; and at forty-three (1825) he published the most celebrated poem
in Swedish literature.</p>
<p>Frithjofs Saga is a series of legends taken from an old Norse cycle
of lays. Some critics 7 thought the epic too rhetorical — the poet could
not discard the episcopal manner; but the splendor of the lyrics carried
the work to en- thusiastic acceptance, even abroad; by 1888 there were
twenty-one transla- tions into English, nineteen into German.</p>
<p>Tegner seems to have consumed himself in his poem; after it his
health declined. He still wrote occasional poems, one dedicated to a
married woman of Vaxjo. Originally a liberal, he passed over to a
dogmatic conservatism, and engaged in warm controversies with the
liberal minority in the Riksdag. A stroke in 1 840 was followed by a
mental disorder, during which he con- tinued to write good poetry. He
died in Vaxjo in 1 846.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>AROUND THE HEARTLAND</p>
<p>663</p>
<p>Meanwhile, King Charles XIII being chronically ill, Crown Prince
Charles John acted as regent, and assumed the responsibilities of
government. He soon faced a choice between loyalties — to his native or
to tus adopted land. Since states are as acquisitive as their component
citizens, and send out pre- hensile pseudopodia, called armies, to seize
delectable objects, the Swedish government looked fondly at contiguous
Norway, over which, at that time, and since 1397, Denmark claimed
proprietary rights. The Crown Prince suggested to Napoleon that French
consent to the Swedish absorption of Norway would strengthen the
friendship between Sweden and France; Na- poleon refused, for Denmark
was one of his most faithful allies. In January 1812 Napoleon again
seized Swedish Pomerania, on the ground that it al- lowed the import of
British goods in violation of his Continental Blockade. Prince Charles
John turned to Russia, which was also ignoring the embargo; Russia
approved of Sweden’s absorption of Norway; Sweden confirmed the Russian
absorption of Finland. In April 1812 Sweden signed an alliance with
Russia, and opened its ports to British trade.</p>
<p>This was the situation in Sweden when Napoleon entertained kings at
Dresden on his way to Moscow.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>DENMARK</li>
</ol>
<p>The news that the Bastille had fallen did not unduly excite the
Danes, who had already, in 1772, abolished serfdom and judicial torture,
reformed the law, the courts and the police, cleansed the civil service
of corruption and jobbery, proclaimed toleration for all religions, and
encouraged literature and art. The Danes looked upon their royal family
as a stake of stability in the conflicts of classes and the flux of
politics; and whSn Louis XVI — who, like their own kings, had supported
liberal measures — was attacked by the Parisian populace, and was
sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Assem- bly, the Danes agreed
with their King that they wanted no such ecstasies. Napoleon was soon
forgiven for calling a halt to the Revolution and restor- ing order in
France. Denmark refused to join in the coalition against Bona-
parte.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Danish government challenged the claims of the
British Admiralty to the right of its naval captains to board, and
search for contraband, any vessel bound for France. On several occasions
in 1799 and 1800 British captains had boarded Danish vessels, and one
commander had captured, and had held in a British port, seven Danish
merchantmen that had resisted him. In August, 1 800, Czar Paul I invited
the Kings of Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark to join him in a Second League
of Armed Neutrality pledged to resist British search of neutral
vessels.* On December 16-18, 1800, the four Baltic Powers signed a
declaration of principles which they agreed to defend:</p>
<ul>
<li>The First League of Armed Neutrality, founded in 1780, had collapsed
in 1793.</li>
</ul>
<p>664 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>that every neutral vessel may navigate freely from port to port on
the coasts of nations at war; (2) goods belonging to the subjects of the
belligerent Powers, with the exception of contraband, are free [from
search when carried] on neutral vessels;… (5) the declaration of the
officer commanding the vessel or vessels of the Royal or Imperial
Marine… that his convoy has no contra- band on board shall suffice to
prevent any visit. 8</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoleon expressed his pleasure with this declaration. Paul I invited
France to join Russia in an invasion of India, with a view to ending
British power there. 9 England felt that the dispute had reached a
critical point, for the combined navies of the neutral powers and France
could put an end to British control of the seas; and that control seemed
the only barrier to Napo- leon’s invasion of England. The British gov
ernment concluded that either the Danish or the Russian fleet had to be
captured or destroyed; the Danish preferably, for a prior attack on
Russia would leave the British fleet in dan- ger of attack from the
rear.</p>
<p>On March 12, 1801, a British fleet under Sir Hyde Parker left
Yarmouth with instructions to go to Copenhagen, to demand that Denmark
withdraw from the League of Armed Neutrality, and, if rebuffed, to seize
or destroy the Danish Navy. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, aged forty-two,
second in command, fretted over his subordination to Admiral Parker,
who, aged sixty- two, had shown a disposition to caution alien to
Nelson’s temperament.</p>
<p>They reached the west coast of Jutland on March 17, sailed cautiously
north and around the Skaggerak point of the peninsula, then south into
the great bay of Kattegat to Sjaelland Island, then through the narrow
strait be- tween Swedish Halsingborg and Danish Helsingor (Hamlet’s
Elsinore), where they were fired upon by the batteries of Kronborg
Castle. The British fleet survived, and moved south into the “Sound” to
the narrowest strait of all, where Copenhagen seemed unreachably
sheltered by forts and the Dan- ish Navy — seventeen vessels arranged
in. a line from north to south, each armed with from twenty to
sixty-four guns.</p>
<p>Admiral Parker decided that his larger ships, of deeper draft than
Nel- son’s, could not enter this shallow strait without danger of being
grounded</p>
<p>The “great gamble” 10 succeeded; the Danish vessels were one after an
- other disabled or sunk. Nelson offered a cease-fire; it was accepted;
and Nel-</p>

<p>AROUND THE HEARTLAND</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>son, undertaking (like Napoleon) diplomacy as well as war, went on
shore to discuss terms of peace with the Danish Regent, Crown Prince
Frederick. The Prince had received the news that Czar Paul I had been
assassinated (March 23, 1801); the League of Armed Neutrality was
falling apart. Fred- erick agreed to withdraw from it. The British
government confirmed Nel- son’s arrangement, and he returned to another
triumph. He rested on his honors until the nation called upon him (1805)
to save, at Trafalgar, Brit- ain’s control of the seas.</p>
<p>Denmark survived, and England joined the rest of Europe in respecting
her. During the next six years the little kingdom struggled to maintain
its neutrality between the nations — Great Britain and Russia — that
controlled the neighboring seas, and the French armies that patrolled
the lands adjoin- ing the precarious peninsula. Generally the Danes
inclined to favor Napo- leon, but they resented his repeated urging of a
more decided partiality. After the Peace of Tilsit he sent the Danish
government a message insisting upon its complete exclusion of British
trade, and the cooperation of its new Navy with the French.</p>
<p>Now, as in 1801, the British government took challenge by the
forelock, and sent a massive fleet, with 27,000 troops, into Danish
waters (July 26,</p>
<p>1807), alleging the most pacific intentions. But George Canning,
foreign minister, persuaded his government that Napoleon was planning to
use the Danish Navy as part of a flotilla that would attempt a landing
in Scotland or Ireland. 11 On July 28 Canning instructed the British
representative in Denmark to inform the Danish Crown Prince that it was
essential to the security of Great Britain that Denmark should ally
itself with England and put its Navy at Engl and’s disposal. The Prince
refused, and prepared to re - sist. British ships thereupon surrounded
Sjaelland, and British troops closed the circle around Copenhagen; the
city was subjected to bombardment from land and sea (September 2-5,
1807), with such “terrible effect” that on September 7 the Danes
surrendered to England their entire fleet — eighteen ships of the line,
ten frigates, and forty-two smaller vessels. 12 Denmark fought on, and
thereafter, till 1813, aligned itself with France.</p>
<p>Between wars — and often inspired by them — the Danes made
significant contribu- tions to science, scholarship, literature, and
art. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851) discovered that a pivoted
magnetic needle will turn at right angles to an object carry- ing an
electric current; the word oersted entered into all European and
American languages to indicate a unit of strength in a magnetic field.
Oersted founded the sci - ence of electromagnetism through thirty years
of experiment.</p>
<p>Nikolai Grundtvig managed, in his eighty-nine years, to be a liberal
theologian, a bishop, a philosopher, an historian, an innovating
educator, a pathfinder in the study of Norse legends and Anglo-Saxon
literature, and the author of an epic poem and songs and hymns still
loved in Scandia.</p>
<p>Denmark in this dramatic age had a lively theater, whose comedies
served as a gadfly to social pretenses; so Peter Andreas Heiberg
(1758-1841) made fun of class distinctions in De Vonner og de V annex (
The Vons and the Vans), and earned so many enemies that he had to seek
safety in Paris, where he served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
under Talleyrand. He left to posterity a son, Johan Ludvig Heiberg
(1791-1860), who dominated the Danish theater in the following age.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>Danish literature now produced at least two poets whose interests and
renown surmounted the barriers of nation and language. Jens Immanuel
Baggesen (1764-1826) was doubly gifted with an attractive character and
graceful style. Charmed by his early verse, the Duke of Augustenburg
paid for the youth’s visits to Germany and Switzerland. Jens met
Wieland, Schil - ler, Herder, and Klopstock; he felt the Romantic
longings of Rousseau, and rejoiced over the French Revolution. He
immersed himself in the Kantian stream that was nourishing German
philosophy; he added Kant’s name to his own. He put his wanderings of
body and mind into Labyrinthen eller Digtervandringer ( Labyrinths of a
Wandering Poet, 1792), which almost rivaled Laurence Sterne in humor and
sentiment. Back in Denmark, he missed the excitement of Weimar and
Paris. From 1800 to 18 11 he lived in France, watching Napoleon
transform liberty into order, and republic into empire. In 1807 he
issued a lively poem, Gjengengeren og ban selv ( The Ghost and Himself
), in which he examined with wit and penetration his wavering between
the classical ideals of order, truth, and moderation and the Romantic
exaltation of freedom, imagination, and desire. In 1 8 1 1 he received a
professorship in the University of Kiel. Two years later he fell into a
wearing war with the greatest of Denmark’s poets.</p>
<p>Adam Gottlob Oehlenschlager (1779-1850) had an unusually happy</p>
<p>youth. His father was caretaker of a suburban palace; the boy had the
gar- den for his playground, the hall for his art gallery, the library
for his school. His imagination prodded him into becoming an actor, but
his friend Hans Christian Oersted drew him into the University of
Copenhagen. He lived through the British bombardment of fleet and
capital in 1801, and felt the influence of the Norwegian philosopher
Henrik Steffens. Finally he reached his own note in Digte (Poems, 1802),
which established the Romantic move- ment in Danish literature.</p>
<p>He advanced his campaign with Poetiske Skriften (1803), a cycle
of</p>
<p>lyrics paralleling the life of Christ with annual changes in nature.
The Estab- lished Church condemned this as heretical pantheism, but the
Danish gov- ernment awarded him a grant for travel in Germany, Italy,
and France. He met Goethe, and perhaps from his example learned to check
his Romantic subjectivity and sentiment. In Nordiske Digte (Northern
Poems, 1807) he turned to Scandinavian mythology with an epic
celebrating the journeys of the god Thor, and with a drama about Haakon
Jarl, who ruled Norway from 970 to 995 and fought a losing battle
against the spread of Christianity. When Oehlenschlager returned to
Copenhagen (1809) he was received as Denmark’s greatest poet.</p>
<p>He took advantage of his popularity to publish a succession of
hastily written works. Jens Baggesen publicly condemned them as
negligent and inferior productions. A controversy flared, in which
Oehlenschlager took little part; his friends, however, fervently
defended him, and challenged Baggesen to a duel in the form of a Latin
disputation. Meanwhile Oehlen- schlager published Helge and Den lille
Hyrdedreng; Baggesen was so pleased</p>

<p>with them that he welcomed the return of “the old Adam.” 13 In 1829
Oehlenschlager was crowned with laurel in Lund by Esaias Tegner. On
November 4, 1 849, his seventieth birthday, he was acclaimed by
contempo- rary poets as “the Adam of our Parnassus.”</p>
<p>In art Denmark offered Europe a sculptor who, at his zenith, had no
living rival but Canova. Bertel Thorwaldsen (1770-1844) won a
scholarship at the Copenhagen Academy, and settled in 1797 in a Rome
that was still in artistic surrender to Winckelmann’s gospel of Hellenic
sculpture as art’s ideal. He caught the attention of Canova, and
followed him in making statues of pagan deities, and of contemporary
celebrities in Greek or Roman pose and garb; so, in 1817, he modeled a
nude bust of Byron as a grave Antinoiis. He succeeded Canova as leader
of the neoclassic school in sculp- ture, and his fame spread so far that
when he left Rome in 1819 for a stay in Copenhagen his progress through
Vienna, Berlin, and Warsaw was al- most a triumphal procession. 14 Now
(1819) he made the model from which Lucas Ahorn hewed out of sandstone
rocks the massive Lion of Lucerne, commemorating the heroism of the
Swiss Guards who died defending Louis XVI in 1792. Copenhagen complained
when he again left it for Rome, but in 1838 it proudly celebrated his
return. By this time he had carved his way into a fortune, part of which
he gave to endow a museum to display his works. Outstanding among these
is the statue that he left of himself, not quite classical in its honest
obesity. He died in 1844, and was buried in the garden of his
museum.</p>

<li>POLAND</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically weakened by the proud individualism of her nobility, and by
economic stagnation through persistent serfdom, Poland had been unable
to resist the three partitions (1772, 1793, 1795-96) that had divided
her among Russia, Prussia, and Austria. She ceased to be a state, but
continued as a culture rich in literature and art, and as a people
passionately resolved to be free. They were nearly all Slavs, except for
a pocket of Germans in the west, and a minority of Jews in Warsaw and
the east. The Poles were Roman Catholics, fervent and dogmatic because
that religion had supported them in their grief, had inspired them in
their hopes, and had preserved social order amid the ruin of their
state. So they condemned heresy as treason, and their patriotism was
intolerant. Only the best-educated and most comfortable among them could
feel any brotherhood with the Jews who were rising in commerce and the
professions — much less with those poorer Jews who, bear- ing the mark
and miseries of the ghetto, could not believe that he in whose name they
had been persecuted was the Messiah who had been promised them.</p>
<p>Christian and Jew alike marveled at Napoleon’s humiliation of Austria
and</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>Russia at Austerlitz, still more at his victories over the Prussians
at Jena and Auerstedt; and now, 1806, he was sitting in Berlin, sending
orders to half a continent. He had chastened Poland’s despoilers; he was
on his way to fight Russia; might he not, en route, declare Poland free,
give her a king and a constitution, and the promise of his powerful
protection? A delegation of leading Poles went to appeal to him; he sent
them back with polite assurances that he would help them now as much as
he could, but that the liberation of Poland would have to wait upon the
results of his coming confrontation with Russia.</p>
<p>Kosciusko, the most persevering of the Polish patriots, cautioned his
coun- trymen not to put their hopes in Napoleon. “He thinks only o f
himself. He hates every great nationality, and still more the spirit of
independence. He is a tyrant, and his only aim is to satisfy his own
ambition.” When Napoleon sent to inquire what Kosciusko wanted, the
Polish leader answered: A gov- ernment li ke England’s, freedom of the
serfs, and a Poland ruling from Danzig to Hungary, from Riga to Odessa.
15</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Poles had organized a small army, and had expelled the
Prussians from Warsaw. When Napoleon entered the capital on December 19,
1806, the populace gave him a wild and joyous reception; Polish troops
joined his army, eager to fight under him against Russia, as a Polish
legion had already fought for him in Italy. Perhaps the Emperor
appreciated still more the beauty and grace of the Polish women. Mme.
Walewska, who at first gave herself to him as a patriotic sacrifice,
fell deeply in love with him, and remained with him through the severe
winter that nearly destroyed his army at Eylau. Then she returned to
Warsaw, while he went on to defeat the Russians at Friedland.</p>
<p>At the Peace of Tilsit (July 9, 1807) he compelled Frederick William
III to surrender Prussia’s claims to central Poland. Article IV of the
treaty rec - ognized the new grand duchy of Warsaw as an independent
state to be ruled by the King of Saxony. On July 22 Napoleon gave the
duchy a constitution based on the French, establishing equality before
the law, religious tolera- tion, conscription, higher taxes, and
censorship of the press. The Catholic Church was placed under the
authority of the state, but the state accepted and protected the
Catholic faith as the religion of the Polish people. The constitution
gave full rights to the Jews, but required state authorization of their
marriages and their acquisition of land. 16 Napoleon, foreseeing a war
to the death with Alexander, tempered the Polish Constitution to ensure
Polish support of France.</p>
<p>In this matter his calculation was largely justified. When Armageddon
came, all classes in Poland supported Napoleon until, in 1814, he could
no longer protect them. The Polish legions in his various armies fought
for him to their last breath. When, returning from Russia in the
greatest military disaster in history, many Poles were drowned in the
collapse of a bridge over the Berezina, some of them cried, “Vive
VEmpereur /” as they sank to their death.</p>

<p>V. TURKEY IN EUROPE</p>
<p>The days of Ottoman achievement in government, literature, and art
were past, but the Turks in 1789 still held sway, however laxly, over
Egypt, the Near East to the Euphrates, Asia Minor and Armenia, Greece,
Bulgaria, Al- bania, Serbia, and those Danubian principalities Wallachia
and Moldavia (now Romania) which were among the disputed morsels
released to Alex- ander by Napoleon (who did not have them) at the Peace
of Tilsit. The sultans, weakened by economic stagnation and moral decay,
allowed the pashas to rule and bleed the provinces with very little
interference from Constantinople; we have noted, with Byron, Ali Pasha’s
strong -arm rule in Albania (1788-1822). Ali overreached himself in
plotting against the Porte; Sultan Mahmud II had him assassinated.</p>
<p>The Serbs fought for independence. When their popular Pasha was slain
by Janis- saries, a Serbian patriot, Karageorge, attempted (1804) to
found a republic, with an elected assembly which would choose a senate;
and in 1808 the senate elected Kara- george hereditary prince. Sultan
Mahmud sent a substantial army to Belgrade to sup- press the new
republic (1813); Karageorge and thousands of his followers fled to
Austria. A second revolt, under Prince Milos Obrenovich, induced the
Sultan to ac- cept a compromise (1815) by which the Serbs were
guaranteed freedom of religion, education, and trade. Milos strengthened
his rule by a mixture of politics and assassina- tion, had his rival
Karageorge executed, and obtained from the Sultan a recognition of his
hereditary rule. By 1830 Serbia was in effect an independent state.</p>
<p>Greece had fallen to the Turks in 1452, and had now been so long
under Ottoman rule that it had half forgotten its ancient pride.
Conquest by “Franks” and immigration by Slavs mingled bloods, racial
memories, and dialects until the popular “demotic” speech had
substantially diverged from the Greek of Plato’s days. Nevertheless
scholars, poets, and patriots had preserved some remembrance of classic
Greece, and of the eleven centuries (395-1452) during which Greeks had
ruled the Byzantine Empire and had continued to enrich scholarship,
philosophy, and art. News of the French Revolution ignited these
memories, and made many Greeks wonder, with Byron’s “Childe Harold,” why
Greece might not again be free. Rhigas Pheraios ( r 757? — 98) , a
Wallachian born in Thessaly and living in Vienna, wrote and spread a
Greek adaptation of “The Marseillaise,” and organized a hetairia, or
brotherhood, dedicated to bringing Greeks and Turks under a common bond
of liberty and equality. He set out for Greece in 1797 with “twelve
chestloads of proclamations,” 17 was captured at Trieste, and was
executed at Belgrade. Another hetairia was formed at Odessa, spread into
Greece, and shared in preparing the Greek mind for revolt. Adamantios
Koraes (1748-1833), a Greek of Smyrna, settled in Paris in 1788, and de-
voted himself to “purifying” current Greek speech in to closer harmony
with ancient norms. He rejoiced over the French Revolution, and, in
anony- mous poems and tracts, as well as in his editions of the Greek
classics, spread</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Xhis republican and anticlerical ideas — though he warned that
revolution might be premature. It came in 182 1, and by 1830 Greece was
free.</p>
<p>The Turkish government, so far as one can judge through the haze of
time and space, of language and prejudice, was not clearly more
oppressive than the governments of Europe before 1800. Byron was shocked
(May 21,</p>
<ol start="1810" type="1">
<li>on seeing the severed heads of criminals exposed on either side of
the gate to the Seraglio, but we may presume that the French
Revolutionary government had guillotined more men and women than the
sultans had ever in equal time beheaded. A majority of the wealth was in
the hands of a small minority — as elsewhere. The Turks were a
philosophical and poetical, as well as a warlike, people; they too k the
day’s fate as Allah’s will, not to be changed by grumbling, and they
considered a beautiful woman, properly disciplined and perfumed, as more
precious than anything but gold. They liked polygamy when they could
afford it; why should not the ablest breed most? They had little need
for prostitutes, but provided brothels for Chris- tians. They were still
producing good literature and art: poets abounded; the mosques sparkled;
probably Istanbul was in 1800 the most beautiful city in Europe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Politically the position of Turkey was perilous. Her economy and army
were in disarray, while the material resources and military power of her
enemies were growing. Her capital was the most strategic point on the
map; all Christian Europe itched for that pearl. Catherine the Great had
stretched Russia’s grasp to the Black Sea, had taken the Crimea from the
Tatars, and, with Voltaire’s blessing, was dreaming of crowning her
grandson Con - stantine in Constantinople.</p>
<p>Such was the situation when Selim III, at the age of twenty-seven,
became sultan (1789). He had received a good education, had formed a
close friend- ship with the French ambassador, and had sent an agent to
France to report to him on West European policies, ideas, and ways. He
decided that unless Turkish institutions were basically reformed his
country could not hold off its enemies. He made peace with Catherine at
Jassy (1792), recogniz- ing Russian sovereignty over the Crimea and the
rivers Dniester and Bug. Then he set himself to giving the Ottoman
Empire a “New Organization” (Nizam-i-Jadid) — based on popular election
of mayors and deputies. With the help of West European officers and
experts he set up schools of naviga- tion and engineering, and gradually
formed a new army. His plans for a return engagement with Russia were
aborted by Napoleon’s conquest of Egypt and attack upon Turkish Acre. He
joined England and Russia in war against France (1798). Peace was
restored in 1802, but the war had been costly and unpopular; the local
governors and venal officials rebelled against the new constitution;
Selim allowed himself to be deposed (1807), but was assassinated
nevertheless. After a year of chaos his party prevailed, and his nephew
Mahmud II began, in 1808, a sultanate of thirty-one years.</p>
<p>The rival Powers of Christendom tried to control the policies of the
Porte by money or force. Turkey survived as a state because none of them
could</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>AROUND THE HEARTLAND</p>
<p>671</p>
<p>afford to allow another to control the Bosporus. In 1806 Alexander I
sent troops into Moldavia and Wallachia to appropriate these provinces
for Rus- sia; Napoleon’s ambassador at the Porte urged Selim to resist;
Turkey de - clared war against Russia. At Tilsit, in 1807, Napoleon
undertook to arrange peace. The resulting truce was repeatedly violated
until Alexander, recon- ciled to war against Napoleon, decided to
withdraw his army from the southern front. On May 28, 1812, one day
before Napoleon left Dresden to join his gathering forces in Poland,
Russia signed with Turkey the Peace of Bucharest, abandoning all her
claims to the Danubian principalities. Now Alexander could gather all
his battalions to meet the 400,000 men — French and others — who were
preparing to cross the Niemen into Russia.</p>
