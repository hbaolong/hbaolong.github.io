<h4 id="chapter-xxii-alexander">CHAPTER XXII Alexander</h4>
<p>I. THE SOUL OF A CONQUEROR</p>
<p>T he intellectual career of Aristotle, after he left his royal pupil,
par- alleled the military career of Alexander; both lives were
expressions of conquest and synthesis. Perhaps it was the philosopher
who instilled into the mind of the youth that ardor for unity which gave
some grandeur to Alexander’s victories; more probably that resolve
descended to him from his father’s ambitions, and was fused into a
passion by his maternal blood. If we would understand Alexander we must
always remember that he bore in his veins the drunken vigor of Philip
and the barbaric intensity of Olym- pias. Furthermore, Olympias claimed
descent from Achilles. Therefore the Iliad had a special fascination for
Alexander; when he crossed the Helles- pont he was, in his
interpretation, retracing the steps of Achilles; when he conquered
Hither Asia he was completing the work that his ancestor had begun at
Troy. Through all his campaigns he carried with him a copy of the Iliad
annotated by Aristotle; often he placed it under his pillow at night
beside his dagger, as if to symbolize the instrument and the goal.</p>
<p>Leonidas, an austere Molossian, trained the boy’s body, Lysimachus
taught him letters, Aristotle tried to form his mind. Philip was anxious
that Alexander should study philosophy, “so that,” he said, “you may not
do a great many things of the sort that I am sorry to have done.’” To
some extent Aristotle made a Hellene of him; through all his life
Alexander ad- mired Greek literature, and envied Greek civilization. To
two Greeks sitting with him at the wild banquet at which he slew Cleitus
he said, “Do you not feel like demigods among savages when you are
sitting in com- pany with these Macedonia ns?”*</p>
<p>Physically, Alexander was an ideal youth. He was good in every sport;
a swift runner, a dashing horseman, a brilliant fencer, a practiced
bowman, a fearless hunter. His friends wished him to enter the foot
races at Olympia; he answered that he would be willing, if his opponents
were kings. When all others had failed to tame the giant horse
Bucephalus, Alexander suc- ceeded; seeing which, says Plutarch, Philip
acclaimed him with prophetic words: “My son, Macedonia is too small for
you; seek out a larger empire,</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>worthier of you.’” Even on the march his wild energy found vent in
shoot - ing arrows at passing objects, or in alighting from, and
remounting, his chariot at full speed. When a campaign lagged he would
go hunting and, unaided and on foot, face any animal in combat; once,
after an encounter with a lion, he was pleased to hear it said that he
had fought as though it had been a duel to decide which of the two
should be king.* He liked hard work and dangerous enterprises, and could
not bear to rest. He laughed at some of his generals, who had so many
servants that they themselves could find nothing to do. “I wonder,” he
told them, “that you with your experience do not know that those who
work sleep more soundly than those for whom other people work. Have you
yet to learn that the great- est need after our victories is to avoid
the vices and the weaknesses of those whom we have conquered? He grudged
the time given to sleep, and said that “s leep and the act of generation
chiefly made him sensible that he was mortal.’” He was abstemious in
eating, and, until his last years, in drinking, though he loved to
linger with his friends over a goblet of wine. He</p>
<p>despised rich foods, and refused the famous chefs who were olfered
him, saying that a night march gave him a good appetite for breakfast,
and a light breakfast gave him an appetite for dinner.’ Perhaps in
consequence of these habits his complexion was remarkably clear, and his
body and b reath, says Plutarch, “were so fragrant as to perfume the
clothes that he wore.’” Discounting the flattery of those who painted or
carved or en - graved his likeness, we know from his contemporaries that
he was hand- some beyond all precedents for a king, with expressive
features, soft blue eyes, and luxuriant auburn hair. He helped to
introduce into Europe the custom of shaving the beard, on the ground
that whiskers offered too ready a handle for an enemy to grasp.®* In
this little item, perhaps, lay his greatest influence upon history.</p>
<p>Mentally he was an ardent student, who was too soon consumed with
responsibilities to reach maturity of mind. Like so many men of action,
he mourned that he could not be also a thinker. “He had,” says Plutarch,
“a violent thirst and passion for learning, which increased as time went
on…. He was a lover of all kinds of reading and knowledge,” and it was
his delight, after a day of marching or fighting, to sit up half the
night con- versing with scholars and scientists. “For my part,” he wrote
to Aristotle, “I had rather surpass others in the knowledge of what is
excellent, than in the extent of my power and dominion.”“ Possibly at
Aristotle’s suggestion he sent a commission to explore the sources of
the Nile, and he gave funds generously for a variety of scientific
inquiries. Whether a longer life wotild</p>
<p>540</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap, xxn</p>
<p>have brought him to Caesar’s clear intelligence, or the subtle
understand - ing of Napoleon, is to be doubted. Royalty found him at
twenty, after which warfare and administration absorbed him; in
consequence he re- mained uneducated to the end. He could talk
brilliantly, but fell into a hundred errors when he wandered from
politics and war. With all his cam- paigns he seems never to have gained
such acquaintance with geography as the science of his time could have
given him. He rose at times above the narrowness of dogma, but remained
to the last a slave to superstition. He put great confidence in the
soothsayers and astrologers that crowded his court; before the battle of
Arbela he spent the night performing magic ceremonies with the magician
Aristander, and offered sacrifices to the god Fear; he who faced all men
and beasts with a very ecstasy of courage was “easily alarmed by
portents and prodigies,” even to changing important plans.’“ He could
lead many thousands of men, could conquer and rule millions, but he
could not control his own temper. He never learned to recognize his own
faults or limitations, but allowed his judgment to be soaked and drowned
in praise. He lived in a frenzy of excitement and glory, and so loved
war that his mind never knew an hour of peace.</p>
<p>His moral character hovered between similar contradictions. He was at
bottom sentimental and emotional, and had, we are told, “melting eyes”;
he was moved sometimes beside himself by poetry and music; he played the
harp with great feeling in his early youth. Teased about this by Philip,
he abandoned the instrument, and thereafter, as if to overcome himself,
refused to listen to any but martial airs.” Sexually he was almost
virtuous, not so much on principle as by preoccupation. His incessant
activity, his long marches and frequent battles, his complex plans and
administrative burdens, used up his resources, and left him little
appetite for love. He took many wives, but as a sacrifice to
statesmanship; he was gallant to ladies, but preferred the company of
his generals. When his aides brought a beautiful woman to his tent la te
at night he asked her, “Why at this time?” “I had to wait,” she replied,
“to get my husband to bed.” Alex - ander dismissed her, and rebuked his
servants, saying that because of them he had narrowly escaped becoming
an adulterer.^ He had many of the qualities of a homosexual, and loved
Hephaestion to madness; but when Theodorus of Taras offered to sell him
two boys of great beauty he sent the Tarentine packing, and begged his
friends to tell him what baseness of soul he had shown that anyone
should make such a proposal to him.” He gave to friendship the
tenderness and solicitude that most men give to love. No statesman known
to us, much less any general, ever surpassed him in</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>54 *</p>
<p>simple trustfulness and warmheartedness, in open sincerity of
affection and purpose, or in generosity even to acquaintances and
enemies.“ Plutarch</p>
<p>One quality in him dominated all the rest — ambition. As a youth he
had fretted over Philip’s victories: “Father,” he complained to his
friends, “will get everything done before we are ready, and will leave
me and you no chance of doing anything great and important.”” In his
passion for achieve - ment he assumed every task, and faced every risk.
At Chaeronea he was the first man to charge the Theban Sacred Band; at
the Granicus he indulged to the full what he called his “eagerness for
encountering danger.”” TTiis, too, became an uncontrollable passion; the
sound and sight of battle intoxi- cated him; he forgot then his duties
as a general, and plunged ahead into the thickest of the fight; time and
again his soldiers, fearful of losing him, had to plead with him to go
to the rear. He was not a great general; he was a brave soldier whose
obstinate perseverance marched on, with boyish heedlessness of
impossibilities, to unprecedented victories. He supplied the
inspiration; probably his generals, who were able men, contributed
organi-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>542</p>
<p>(chap, xzn</p>
<p>zation, training, tactics, and strategy. He led his troops by the
brilliance of his imagination, the fire of his unstudied oratory, the
readiness and sin- cerity with which he shared their hardships and
griefs. Without question he was a good administrator: he ruled with
kindness and firmness the wide domain which his arms had won; he was
loyal to the agreements which he signed with commanders and cities; and
he tolerated no oppression of his subjects by his appointees. Amid all
the excitement and chaos of his cam- paigns he kept clearly at the
center of his thoughts the great purpose that even his death would not
defeat: the unification of all the eastern Mediter- ranean world into
one cultural whole, dominated and elevated by the ex- panding
civilization of Greece.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PATHS OF GLORY</li>
</ol>
<p>On his accession Alexander found himself at the head of a
tottering</p>
<p>empire. The northern tribes in Thrace and Illyria revolted; Aetolia,
Acar- nania, Phocis, Elis, Argolis renounced their allegiance; the
Ambraciotes ex- pelled the Macedonian garrison; Artaxerxes III boasted
that he had insti- gated the killing of Philip, and that Persia now had
nothing to fear from the immature stripling of twenty who had succeeded
to the throne. When the glad tidings of Philip’s death reached Athens,
Demosthenes donned fes - tal garb, placed a garland of flowers upon his
head, and moved in the As- sembly that a crown of honor should be voted
to the assassin Pausanias.“ Within Macedonia a dozen factions conspired
against the young King’s life.</p>
<p>Alexander rose to the situation with a decisive energy that ended all
internal opposition, and set the tempo of his career. Having arrested
and decapitated the chief plotters at home, he marched south into Greece
(336), and within a few days reached Thebes. The Greek states hastened
to renew their allegiance; Athens sent him a profuse apology, voted him
two crowns, and conferred upon him divine honors. Alexander, appeased,
declared all dictatorships abolished in Greece, and decreed that each
city should live in freedom according to its own laws. The Amphictyonic
Council con- firmed him in all the rights and honors that it had given
to Philip; and a congress of all Greek states except Sparta, meeting. at
Corinth, proclaimed him captain general of the Greeks, and promised to
contribute men and supplies for the Asiatic campaign. Alexander returned
to Pella, put the capital in order, and then marched north to suppress
the rebellion of the barbarian tribes (335). With Napoleonic swiftness
he led his troops as far as the modem Bucharest, and planted his
standards upon the northern bank</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>CHAP.XXn)</p>
<p>of the Danube. Then, hearing that the Illyrians were advancing upon
Macedonia, he marched two hundred miles through Serbia, surprised the
invaders in the rear, defeated them, and drove the remnant back to their
mountains.</p>
<p>But in the meantime a rumor had stirred Athens that Alexander had
been killed in fighting on the Danube. Demosthenes called for a war of
inde- pendence, and felt justified in accepting large sums from Persia
to further his plans. At his instigation Thebes revolted, killed the
Macedonian offi- cials left there by Alexander, and besieged the
Macedonian garrison in the Cadmeia. Athens sent help to Thebes, and
invited Greece and Persia to join in an alliance against Macedon.
Alexander, furious over what seemed to him not a passion for freedom but
the crudest ingratitude and treachery, marched his weary troops down
again into Greece. Reaching Thebes after thirteen days, he defeated the
army sent out against him. He left the fate of the defenseless city to
her ancient enemies — Plataea, Orchomenos, Thes- piae, and Phocis; they
voted that Thebes should be burned to the ground, and her inhabitants
sold as slaves. Hoping to give other rebels a lesson, Alexander signed
the order, but stipulated that the victorious troops should spare the
home of Pindar, and the lives of priests and priestesses, and of all
Thebans who could prove that they had opposed the revolt. Later he
looked back with shame upon this violent revenge, and “was sure to grant
without the least difficulty whatsoever any Theban asked of him.”“ He
atoned in part by his leniency with Athens; he forgave her violation of
the pledges made to him a year before, and did not press his demand for
the sur- render of Demosthenes and the other anti-Macedonian leaders. To
the end of his life he ipaintained an attitude of respect and affection
for Athens: he dedicated on ^the Acropolis various spoils from his
Asiatic victories, sent back to Athens the Tyrannicide statues that
Xerxes had taken away, and re marked, after an arduous campaign, “O ye
Athenians, will you believe what dangers I incur to merit your
praise?</p>
<p>Having received again the allegiance of all the Greek states except
Sparta, Alexander returned to Macedonia, and prepared for the invasion
of Asia. He found his state treasury almost empty, with a deficit of
five hundred talents (,000,000) as a legacy from Philip’s reign.“ He
borrowed eight hundred talents, and set out to conquer not the world but
his debts. He had hoped to fight Persia as the champion of all Hellas,
but he knew that half of Greece was praying that he would soon be
killed. It was reported that the Persians could muster a million men;
Alexander’s expeditionary force did not exceed thirty thousand infantry
and five thousand cavalry.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>Nevertheless the new Achilles, leaving twelve thousand soldiers under
Antipater to guard Macedonia and watch Greece, set out in 334 upon the
most daring and romantic enterprise in the history of kings. He would
live eleven years more, but would never see home or Europe again. While
his army crossed the Hellespont from Sestos to Abydos, he himself chose
to land at Cape Sigeum, and retrace what he believed to have been
Agamem- non’s path to Tr oy. At every step he quoted to his comrades
passages from the Iliad, which he knew almost by heart. He anointed the
reputed tomb of Achilles, crowned it with garlands, and ran naked around
it according to the custom of antiquity. “Happy Achilles!” he exclaimed,
“to have had in life so faithful a friend, and, after his death, so
famous a poet to celebrate him.”“ He vowed now to carry through to a
successful end that long</p>
<p>struggle, between Europe and Asia, which had begun at Troy.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to our purpose to tell again the story of his
victories. He met the first Persian contingent at the river Granicus,
and overwhelmed it. There Cleitus saved his life by severing the arm of
the Persian who was about to strike Alexander from behind; a whimsical
student might build upon such events an accidental interpretation of
history. After giving his men a rest he marched down into Ionia,
offering the Greek cities demo- cratic self-government under his
protectorate. Most of them opened their gates without resistance. At
Issus he met the main force of the Persians, 600,000 men, under Darius
III. Once more he won by using his cavalry for attack, his infantry for
defense. Darius fled, leaving his purse and his family behind him, to be
treated the one with gratitude, the other with chivalry. After peaceably
taking Damascus and Sidon Alexander laid siege to Tyre, which was
harboring a large Phoenician squadron in the pay of Persia. The ancient
city resisted so long that when at last he captured it Alexander lost
his head and allowed his men to massacre eight thousand Tyrians, and to
sell thirty thousand as slaves. Jerusalem surrendered quietly, and was
well treated; Gaza fought till every man in the city was dead and every
woman raped.</p>
<p>The triumphant march of the Macedonians was resumed through the Sinai
desert into Egypt, where, when he showed a tactful respect for the
country’s gods, Alexander was welcomed as a divinely sent liberator from
Persian rule. Knowing that religion is stronger than politics, he
crossed another desert to the oasis of Siwa, and paid his respects to
the god Am- mon — his very father if Olympias could be believed. The
pliant priests crowned him Pharaoh with the ancient rites, and so eased
the way for the Ptolemaic dynasty. Returning to the Delta, Alexander
conceived or ap-</p>

<p>proved the idea of building a new capital at one of the Nile’s many
mouths; perhaps the Greek merchants at near-by Naucratis suggested it as
pro- viding a more convenient depot for the enlarged Greek trade that
might now be expected between Egypt and Greece. He marked out the orbit
of the walls of Alexandria, the outline of the principal streets, and
the sites for temples to the Egyptian and Grecian gods; further details
he left to his architect. Dinocrates.*</p>
<p>Marching back into Asia, he met the vast polyglot army of Barius
at</p>
<p>Gaugamela, near Arbela, and was dismayed by their multitude; he knew
that one defeat would cancel all his victories. His soldiers comforted
him: “Be of good cheer. Sire; do not fear the great number of the enemy,
for they will not be able to stand the very smell of goat that clings to
us.”“ He spent the night in reconnoitering the ground on which he was to
give battle, and in offering sacrifices to the gods. His victory was
decisive. The disorderly hosts of Darius could make no headway against
the phalanxes, and knew not how to defend themselves against the swift
and incalculable dashes of the Macedonian cavalry; they broke and fled,
and Darius was not the last to go. While Darius’ generals assassinated
him as a coward, Alexander received the submission of Babylon, partook
of its wealth, distributed some of it to his soldiers, but charmed the
city by making obeisance to its gods, and decreeing the restoration of
its sacred shrines. By the end of the year (33 1 ) he had reached Susa,
whose population, still remembering the ancient glory of Elam, welcomed
him as a deliverer. He protected the city from pillage, but comforted
his troops by dividing among them some of the fifty thousand talents
(00,000,000) that he found in Darius’ vaults. To the people of Plataea
he sent a substantial sum because they had so bravely resisted the
Persians in 480; and to the Greek cities of Asia he appears to have
remitted the “donations” that he had elicited from them at the outset of
his campaign.” And he announced proudly to the Greeks of the world that
they were now completely free from Persian rule.</p>
<p>Hardly stopping to rest at Susa, he marched over mountains in the</p>
<p>depth of winter to seize Persepolis; and so rapidly did he move that
he was in Darius’ palace before the Persians could conceal the royal
treasury. Here</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinocrates had pleased Alexander by proposing to carve Mt. Athos —
six thousand feet high — into a figure of Alexander standing waist deep
in the sea, holding a city in one hand</li>

<p>he men. Perhaps they had been infuriated by seeing, on their approach
to the town, eight hundred Greeks who, for various reasons, had suffered
mutilation at the hands of Persians by the cutting off of legs, arms, or
ears, or the gouging out of the eyes. Alexander, moved to tears by the
sight, gave them lands, and assigned dependents to work for them.</p>
<p>Still insatiate, he attempted now what Cyrus the Great had failed to
ac- complish — the subjugation of the tribes that hovered on the eastern
borders of Persia. Perhaps in his simple geography he hoped to find,
beyond that mystic East, the ocean that would serve as a natural
frontier for his con- quered realm. Entering Sogdiana, he came upon a
village inhabited by the descendants of those Branchidae who, in 480,
had surrendered to Xerxes the treasures of their temple near Miletus.
Fevered with the thought that he was revenging the pillaged god, he
ordered all the inhabitants slain, in- cluding the women and children —
visiting the sins of the fathers upon the</p>
<p>The year 327 found him passing over the Himalayas into India. Vanity
conspired with curiosity to lead him into such distant territory; his
gen- erals advised against it, his army obeyed him unwillingly. Crossing
the Indus, he defeated King Porus, and announced that he would continue
to the Ganges. But his soldiers refused to go farther. He pled with
them, and for three days, like a scion of Achilles, pouted in his tent;
but they had had enough. Sadly he turned back, loath to face west again,
and forced his way through hostile tribes with such personal bravery
that his soldiers wept at their inability to realize all his dreams. He
was the first to scale the walls of the Mallians; after he and two
others had leaped into the city the ladders broke, and they found
themselves alone amidst the enemy. AJexander fought till he sank
exhausted by his wounds. Meanwhile his troops had made their way into
the town, and soldier after soldier sacrificed his life to protect the
fallen King. When the battle was over Alexander was carried to his tent,
and his veterans kissed his garments as he passed. After three</p>

<p>months of convalescence he renewed his march along the Indus, and at
last reached the Indian Ocean. There he sent on part of his forces by
water under Nearchus, who skillfully accomplished the long voyage in
unfamiliar seas. Alexander himself led the rest of his army northwest
along the coast of India and through the desert of Gedrosia
(Baluchistan), where the suf- ferings of his men rivaled those of
Napoleon’s army on the return from Moscow. Heat killed thousands, thirst
killed more. A little water was found, and was brought to Alexander, but
he deliberately poured it out upon the ground.” When the remnants of his
force reached Susa some ten thousand had died, and Alexander was half
insane.</p>
<p>ra. THE DEATH OF A GOD</p>
<p>He had now spent nine years in Asia, and he had changed the continent
by his victories less than it had transformed him by its ways. He had
been told by Aristotle to treat Greeks as freemen, “barbarians” as
slaves. But he had been surprised to find among the Persian aristocrats
a degree of refinement and good manners not often seen in the turbulent
democracies of Greece; he admired the manner in which the Great Kings
had organized their empire, and wondered how his rough Macedonians could
replace such governors. He concluded that he could give some permanence
to his conquests only by reconciling the Persian nobles to his
leadership, and using them in administrative posts. More and more
charmed by his new subjects, he abandoned the idea of ruling over them
as a Macedonian, and conceived himself as a Greco-Persian emperor
governing a realm in which- Persians and Greeks would be on an equal
footing, and would peaceably mingle their culture and their blood. The
long quarrel of.Europe and Asia would end in a wedding feast.</p>
<p>Already thousands of his soldiers had married native women, or were
living with them; should he not do likewise, marry the daughter of
Darius, and reconcile the nations by begetting a king who would unite
both dynas- ties in his veins? He had already married Roxana, a Bactrian
princess; but this was a negligible impediment. He broached the plan to
his officers, and suggested that they, too, should take Persian wives.
They smiled at his hopes of uniting the two nations, but they had been a
long time away from home, and the Persian ladies were beautiful. So in
one great nuptid at Susa (324) Alexander married Statira, daughter of
Darius III, and Pary- satis, daughter of Artaxerxes III, attaching
himself in this way to both</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>branches of Persian royalty, while eighty of his officers took
Persian brides. Thousands of similar marriages were soon afterward
celebrated among the soldiers. Alexander gave each officer a substantial
dowry, and paid the debts of the marrying soldiers — which amounted (if
we may believe Ar- rian) to twenty thousand talents (20,000,000).” To
further this union of peoples he opened lands in Mesopotamia and Persia
to Greek colonists, thereby reducing the pressure of population in some
of the Greek states, and mitigating the class war; now began those
Hellenized Asiatic cities which were to be a vital part of the Seleucid
Empire. At the same time he drafted thirty thousand Persian youths, had
them educated on Greek lines, and taught them the Greek manual of
war.</p>
<p>Possibly his wives had something to do with his rapid adoption of
Orien- tal ways; possibly it was a failure of modesty, or a part of his
plan. “In Persia,” says Plutarch, “he first put on the barbaric” (i.e.,
foreign) “dress, perhaps with the view of making the work of civilizing
the Persians easier, as nothing gains more upon men than a conformity to
their customs…. However, he followed not the Median fashion… but taking
a middle way between the Persian mode and the Macedonian, so contrived
his habit that it was not so flaunting as the one, and yet more pompous
and magnificent than the other.”” His soldiers saw in this change the
conquest of Alexan - der by the Orient; they felt that they had lost
him, and they mournfully missed the signs of solicitude and affection
which he had once showered upon them. The Persians made every obeisance
to him, and flattered him to his heart’s content; the Macedonians,
themselves softened by Oriental</p>
<p>His culminating apostasy, or diplomacy, was his announcement of his
own divinity. In 324 he sent word to all the Greek states except Mace-
donia (where the insult to Philip might have aroused resentment) that he
wished hereafter to be publicly recognized as the son of Zeus-Ammon.
Most of the states complied, feeling it to be merely a form; even the
ob- s tinate Spartans agreed, saying, “Let Alexander be a god if he
wants to.” It was not so much for a man to be a god in the Greek sense
of the term; the chasm between humanity and deity was not as wide then
as it was to become in modem theology; several Greeks had overleaped it,
like Hip- podameia, Oedipus, Achilles, Iphigenia, and Helen. The
Egyptians had always thought of their Pharaohs as gods; if Alexander had
neglected to rank himself similarly the Egyptians might have been
disturbed by so bold</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>a violation of precedent. The priests at Siwa, Didyma, and Babylon,
who were believed to have special sources of information in this field,
had all assured him of his divine origin. That (as Grote thought”)
Alexander actu - ally believed himself to be a god in a more than
metaphorical sense is quite unlikely. It is true that after his
self-deification he became increasingly irritable and arrogant; that he
sat on a golden throne, wore sacred vest- ments, and sometimes adorned
his head with the horns of Ammon.“ But when he was not playing his
divinity for world stakes he smiled at his own honors. Being injured by
an arrow, he remarked to some friends, “This, you see, is blood, and not
such ichor as flows from the wounds of the Immortals.”“ That he had not
taken too seriously his mother’s tale of the thunderbolt appears from
his flaming anger at Attains’ imputations on his birth, and his remark
about the need of sleep as distinguishing man from the gods. Even
Olympias laughed when she heard that Alexander had made her legend
official. “When,” she asked, “will Alexander stop slander - ing me to
Hera?”“ Despite his godhead Alexander continued to offer sac - rifice to
the gods — an unheard-of thing for a divinity. Plutarch and Arrian, able
to judge the matter as Greeks, took it for granted that Alexander
deified himself as a means to easier rule over a superstitious and
heterogeneous population.“ Doubtless he felt that the task of unifying
two hostile worlds would be facilitated by the reverence which the
common people would give him if his claims to divinity were accepted by
the upper classes. Per- haps, indeed, he thought to overcome the
disruptive diversity of faiths in his empire by providing, in his own
person, the beginning of a sacred myth and a common unifying faith.*</p>
<p>The Macedonian officers could not fathom Alexander’s policy. The</p>
<p>Greek spirit had touched them to the point of mental emancipation,
but not to the point of philosophical toleration; they found it
humiliating to prostrate themselves, as he now demanded, in approaching
the King. One of his bravest officers, Philotas, son of his ablest and
most favored general, Parmenio, entered into a conspiracy to kill the
new god. Alexander got wind of it, had Philotas arrested, and wrung from
him by torture a confes- sion implicating his own father. Philotas was
forced to repeat the confes- sion before the soldiers, who, in accord
with their custom in such cases, at once stoned him to death; Parmenio
was executed by messenger as prob-</p>

<p>ably guilty, and in any case a presumptive enemy. From that moment to
the end, the relations between Alexander and his army became increas-
ingly strained — the troops ever more discontent, the King ever more
sus- picious, severe, and lonely.</p>
<p>His solitary exaltation and the growing multitude of his cares
inclined him to seek forgetfulness in heavy draughts of wine. At a
banquet in Samarkand Cleitus, who had saved his life at the Granicus,
drank himself into such candor as to tell Alexander that his victories
had been won by his soldiers rather than by him, and that Philip’s
achievement had been much greater,</p>
<p>In the end the discontent in the army verged on open mutiny. When the
King announced that he would send back to Macedon the oldest of the
soldiers, each richly paid for his services, f he was shocked to hear
many muttering that they wished he would dismiss them all, since, being
a god, he had no need of men to realize his purposes. He ordered the
leaders of the sedition executed, and then addressed to his troops an
affecting (but probably apocryphal) speech“ in which he reminded them of
all that they had done for him, and he for them, and asked which of them
could show more scars than he, whose body bore the marks of every weapon
used in war. Finally he gave them all permission to go home: “Go back
and report</p>
<p>• There are conflicting stories about his guilt and his death ” He
left three main works: Hellenica, a history of Greece from 387 to 337; a
History of the Sacred War, and a History of Alexander,</p>
<p>Each of them, Arrian assures us, received a talent in addition to his
pay — which continued till he reached his home.^</p>

<p>551</p>
<p>hat you deserted your king and left him to the protection of
conquered foreigners.” Then he retired to his rooms, and refused to see
anyone. His soldiers, stricken with remorse, came and lay down before
the palace, say- ing that they would not leave till he had forgiven them
and reaccepted them into his army. When at last he appeared they broke
into tears and insisted on kissing him; and after being reconciled with
him they went back to their camp shouting a song of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Deceived by this show of affection, Alexander dreamed now of further
campaigns and victories; he planned the subjugation of hidden Arabia,
sent a mission to explore the Caspian regions, and thought of conquering
Europe to the Pillars of Hercules. But his strong frame had been weak-
ened by exposure and drink, and his spirit by the conspiracies of his
officers and the mutinies of his men. While the army was in Ecbatana his
dearest companion, Hephaestion, fell sick and died. Alexander had loved
him so much that when Darius’ queen, entering the conqueror’s tent,
bowed first to Hephaestion, thinking him Alexander, the young King said,
graciously, “Hephaestion is also Alexander”“— as if to say that he and
Hephaestion were one. The two often shared one tent, and drank from one
cup; in battle they fought side by side. Now the King, feeling that half
of him had been torn away, broke down in uncontrolled grief. He lay for
hours upon the corpse, weeping; he cut off his hair in mourning, and for
days refused to take food. He sentenced to death the physician who had
left the sick youth’s side to attend the public games. He ordered a
gigantic funeral pile to be erected in Hephaestion’s memory, at a cost,
we are tol d, of ten thousand talents (0,000,000), and sent to inquire
of the oracle of Ammon whether it was permitted to worship Hephaestion
as a god. In his next campaign a whole tribe was slain, at his orders,
as a sacrifice to Hephaestion’s ghost. The thoug ht that Achilles had
not long survived Patroclus haunted him like a sentence of death.</p>
<p>Back in Babylon, he abandoned himself more and more to drink. One
night, reveling with his officers, he proposed a drinking match.
Promachus quaffed twelve quarts of wine, and won the prize, a talent;
three days later he died. Shortly afterward, at another banquet,
Alexander drained a goblet containing six quarts of wine. On the next
night he drank heavily again; and cold weather suddenly setting in, he
caught a fever, and took to his bed. The fever raged for ten days,
during which Alexander continued to give orders to his army and his
fleet. On the eleventh day he died, being in the thirty-third year of
his age (323). When his generals asked him to whom he lef t his empire
he answered, “To the strongest.”“</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXH</p>
<p>Like most great men he had been unable to find a successor worthy of
him, and his work fell unfinished from his hands. Even so his
achievement was not only immense, but far more permanent than has
usually been sup- posed. Acting as the agent of historical necessity, he
put an end to the era of city-states, and, by sacrificing a substantial
measure of local freedom, created a larger system of stability and order
than Europe had yet known. His conception of government as absolutism
using religion to impose peace upon diverse nations dominated Europe
until the rise of nationalism and democracy in modem times. He broke
down the barriers between Greek and “barbarian,” and prepared for the
cosmopolitanism of the Hellenistic age; he opened Hither Asia to Greek
colonization, and established Greek settlements as far east as Bactria;
he united the eastern Mediterranean world into one great web of
commerce, liberating and stimulating trade. He brought Greek literature,
philosophy, and art to Asia, and died before he could realize that he
had also made a pathway for the religious victory of the East over the
West. His adoption of Oriental dress and ways was the beg inning of
Asia’s revenge.</p>
<p>It was just as well that he died at his zenith; added years would
almost surely have brought him disillusionment. Perhaps if he had lived
he might have been deepened by defeat and suffering, and might have
learned — as he was beginning — to love statesmanship more than war. But
he had under- taken too much; the strain of holding his swollen realm
together, and watching all its parts, was probably disordering his
brilUant mind. Energy is only half of genius; the other half is harness;
and Alexander was all energy. We miss in him — though we have no right
to expect — the calm mamrity of Caesar, or the subtle wisdom of
Augustus. We admire him as we admire Napoleon, because he stood alone
against half the world, and because he encourages us with the thought of
the incredible power that lies potential in the individual soul. And we
feel a natural sympathy for him, despite his superstitions and his
cruelties, because we know that he was at least a generous and
affectionate youth, as well as incomparably able and brave; that he
fought against a maddening heritage of barbarism in his blood; and that
through all battles and all bloodshed he kept before his eyes the dream
of bringing the light of Athens to a larger world.</p>

<li>THE END OF AN AGE</li>
</ol>
<p>When the news of his death reached Greece, revolts against the Mace-
donian authority broke out everywhere. Theban exiles in Athens
organized</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>a force of patriots, and besieged the Macedonian garrison in the
Cadmeia. In Athens itself, where many had prayed for an end to
Alexander, the anti- Macedonian party, feeling that its prayers had been
heard, crowned them- selves with garlands and feasted over the death of
him whom they had courted as a god — singing, says Plutarch, “triumphant
songs of victory, as if by their own valor they had vanquished
him.”“</p>
<p>For a moment Demosthenes was in his glory. He had not fared well dur-
ing Alexander’s campaigns: he had been convicted of accepting a heavy
bribe from Harpalus, and had been flung into jail; he had been allowed
to escape, and had lived nine months of fretting exile in Troezen. Now
he was recalled, and was sent as envoy to the Peloponnesus to raise
allies for Athens in a war of liberation. A united force marched north,
met Antipa- ter at Crannon, and was destroyed. The old soldier, who
lacked Alexan- der’s sensitivity to Athenian culture, laid the most
arduous terms upon the city, requiring it to pay the cost of the war, to
receive a Macedonian gar- rison, to abandon its democratic constitution
and courts, to disfranchise and deport to colonial settlements all
citizens (12,000 out of 2 1,000) possessing less than two thousand
drachmas’ worth of property, and to surrender Demosthenes, Hypereides,
and two other anti-Macedonian orators. De- mosthenes fled to Calauria
and took refuge in a temple sanctuary. Sur- rounded by Macedonian
pursuers, he drank a phial of poison, and died be- fore he could drag
himself out of the sacred court.</p>
<p>The same tragic year saw the end of Aristotle. He had long been un-
popular in Athens: the Academy and the school of Isocrates disliked him
as a critic and a rival, while the patriots looked upon him as a leader
of the pro-Macedonian party. Advantage was tak en of Alexander’s death
to bring an accusation of impiety against Aristotle; heretical passages
from his books were brought in as evidence; he was charged with having
offered divine honors to the dictator Hermeias, who, being a slave,
could not have been a god. Aristotle quietly left the city, saying that
he would not give Athens a chance to sin a second time against
philosophy.“ He withdrew to the home of his mother’s family in Chalcis,
leaving the Lyceum in the care of Theophrastus. The Athenians passed
sentence of death upon him, but had neither opportunity nor need to
execute it. For either through a stomach illness aggravated by his
flight, or, as some say,“ by taking poison, Aristotle died a few months
after leaving Athens, in the sixty-third year of his age. His will was a
model of kindly consideration for his second wife, his family, and his
slaves.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>The death of Greek democracy was both a violent and a natural death,
in which the fatal agents were the organic disorders of the system; the
sword of Macedon merely added the final blow. The city-state had proved
incapable of solving the problems of government: it had failed to
preserve order within, and defense without; despite the appeals of
Gorgias, Isocrates, and Plato for some Dorian discipline to tame Ionian
freedom, it had dis- covered no way of reconciling local autonomy with
national stability and power; and its love of liberty had seldom
interfered with its passion for empire. The class war had become bitter
beyond control, and had turned democracy into a contest in legislative
looting. The Assembly, a noble body in its better days, had degenerated
into a mob hating all superiority, rejecting all restraint, ruthless
before weakness but cringing before power, voting itself every favor,
and taxing property to the point of crushing initiative, industry, and
thrift. Philip, Alexander, and Antipater did not destroy Greek freedom;
it had destroyed itself; and the order that they forged preserved for
centuries longer, and disseminated through Egypt and the East, a
civilization that might otherwise have died of its own tyrannous
anarchy.</p>
<p>And yet, had oligarchy or monarchy done any better? The Thirty had
committed more atrocities against life and property in the few months of
their power than the democracy in the preceding hundred years.“ And
while democracy was producing chaos in Athens, monarchy was producing
chaos in Macedonia — a dozen wars of succession, a hundred
assassinations, and a thousand interferences with freedom — with no
redeeming glory of literature, science, philosophy, or art. The weakness
and smallness of the state in Greece had been a boon to the individual,
if not in body, certainly in soul; that freedom, costly though it was,
had generated the achieve- ments of the Greek mind. Individualism in the
end destroys the group, but in the interim it stimulates personality,
mental exploration, and artistic creation. Greek democracy was corrupt
and incompetent, and had to die. But when it was dead men realized how
beautiful its heyday had been; and all later generations of antiquity
looked back to the centuries of Pericles and Plato as the zenith of
Greece, and of all history.</p>
