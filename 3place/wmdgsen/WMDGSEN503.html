<h4 id="chapter-xxxiv">CHAPTER XXXIV</h4>
<p>Music</p>
<p>1300-1564</p>
<p>I. THE INSTRUMENTS</p>
<p>T HE popularity of music in these centuries corrects the somber note
that history tends to give them; every now and then, through the ex-
citement and bitterness of the religious revolution, we hear people
singing. “I care nothing for the pleasures of food, gaming, and love,”
wrote the passionate printer Etienne Dolet; “music alone . . . takes me
prisoner, holds me fast, dissolves me in e cstasy.” 1 From the pure note
of a girl’s voice or a perfect flute to the polyphonic counterpoint of
Depres or Palestrina, every nation and class redeemed with music the
commercialism and theology of the age. Not only did everyone sing;
Francesco Landino complained that everyone composed. 2 Between the merry
or plaintive folk songs of the village and the solemn High Masses of the
Church a hundred forms of music lent their harmony to dances, ballets,
banquets, courtships, courts, processions, pageants, plays, and prayers.
The world sang.</p>
<p>The merchants of Antwerp were escorted daily to the Bourse by a band.
Kings studied music as no feminine or mechanical prerogative but as a
mark and fount of civilization. Alfonso X of Spain sedulously and
lovingly col- lected songs to the Virgin — Cantigas de Santa Maria.
James IV of Scotland wooed Margaret Tudor with clavichord and lute;
Charles VIII of France took the royal choir with him on his campaigns in
Italy; Louis XII sang tenor in the court choir; Leo X composed French
chansons; 3 Henry VIII and Francis I courted and challenged each other
with rival choirs on the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Luis Milan
described Portugal in 1540 as “a veritable sea of music.” 4 The court of
Matthias Corvinus at Buda had a choir rated equal to the pope’s, and
there was a good school of music under Sigismund II in Cracow. Germany
was bursting with song in Luther’s</p>
<p>youth. “We have singers here in Heidelberg,” wrote Alexander Agricola
in 1 484, “whose leader composes for eight or twelve voices.” 6 At
Mainz, Nuremberg, Augsburg, and elsewhere the Meistersinger continued to
adorn popular songs and Biblical passages with the pomp of pedantry and
the jewelry of counterpoint. The German folk songs were probably the
best in Europe. Everywhere music was the prod of piety and the lure of
love. 771</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>772</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>Although nearly all music in this age was vocal, the accompanying in-
struments were as diverse as in a modern orchestra. There were string
instru- ments like psalteries, harps, dulcimers, shawms, lutes, and
viols; wind instruments like flutes, oboes, bassoons, trumpets,
trombones, cornets, and bagpipes; percussion instruments like drums,
bells, clappers, cymbals, and castanets; keyboard instruments like
organs, clavichords, harpsichords, spinets, virginals; there were many
more; and of many there were fascinating variants in place and time.
Every educated home had one or more musical instruments, and some homes
had special cabinets to hold them. Often they were works of art, fondly
carved or fancifully formed, and they were handed down as treasures and
memories from generation to generation. Some organs were as elaborately
designed as Gothic cathedral fronts; so the men who built the organs for
the Sebalduskirche and the Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg became “immortal”
for a century. The organ was the chief but not the only instrument used
in churches; flutes, pipes, drums, trom- bones, even kettledrums might
add their incongruous summons to adoration.</p>
<p>The favorite accompaniment for the single voice was the lute. Like
all string instruments, it had an Asiatic origin. It came into Spain
with the Moors, and there, as the vihuela, it rose to the dignity of a
solo instrument, for which the earliest known purely instrumental music
was composed. Usually its body was made of wood and ivory, and shaped
like a pear; its belly was pierced with holes in the pattern of a rose;
it had six — sometimes twelve — pairs of strings, which were plucked by
the fingers; its neck was divided by frets of brass into a measured
scale, and its pegbox was turned back from the neck. When a pretty girl
held a lute in her lap, strummed its strings, and added her voice to its
tones, Cupid could save an arrow. How- ever, it was difficult to keep
the lute in tune, for the constant pull of the strings tended to warp
the frame, and one wit said of an old lutanist that sixty of his eighty
years had been spent in tuning his instrument. 6</p>
<p>The viol differed from the lute in having its strings stretched over
a bridge and played by a bow, but the principle was the same — the
vibration of taut struck strings over a box perforated to deepen sound.
Viols came in three sizes: the large bass viola da gamba, held between
the legs like its modern re- placement, the violoncello; the small tenor
viola da braccio, held on the arm; and a treble viol. During the
sixteenth century the viola da braccio evolved into the violin, and in
the eighteenth the viol passed out of use.</p>
<p>The only European invention in musical instruments was the keyboard,
by which the strings were indirectly struck instead of being directly
plucked or bowed. The oldest known form, the clavichord, made its debut
in the twelfth century and survived to be “well tempered” by Johann
Sebastian Bach; the oldest extant example (1537) is in the Metropolitan
Museum in New York. In the fifteenth century a sturdier variant took
form in the harp-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV )</p>
<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>773</p>
<p>sichord; this allowed modifications of tone through differences of
pressure; sometimes a second keyboard extended the gamut, and stops and
couplers offered new marvels of sound. The spinet and virginal were
Italian and Eng- lish variants of the harpsichord. These keyboard
instruments, like the viol and the lute, were prized for their beauty as
well as their tone, and formed a graceful element of decoration in
well-to-do homes.</p>
<p>As instruments improved in range and quality of tone and in
complexity of operation, more and more training and skill were required
to play them successfully; an audience grew for performances of one or
more instruments without voices, and virtuosos appeared for the organ
and the lute. Conrad Paumann (d. 1473), the blind organist of Nuremberg,
traveled from court to court giving recitals whose excellence knighted
him. Such developments encouraged the composition of music for
instruments alone. Till the fif- teenth century nearly all instrumental
music had apparently been intended to accompany voices or dances, but in
that century several paintings show musicians playing with no visible
singing or dancing. The oldest surviving music for instruments alone is
the Fundamentum organisandi (1452) of Conrad Paumann, which was composed
primarily as a guide to organ play- ing, but contained also a number of
pieces for solo performance. Ottaviano dei Petrucci’s application of
movable metal types to the printing of music (1501) lowered the cost of
publishing instrumental and other compositions. Music written for dances
lent itself to independent presentation; hence the influence of dance
forms on ins trumental music; the suite of “movements” composed for a
succession of dances led to the symphony and the chamber music quartet,
whose parts sometimes retained dance names. The lute, viol, organ, and
harpsichord were favored for solo or orchestral performances. Alberto da
Ripa achieved such fame as a lutanist at the court of Francis I and
Henry II that when he died (1551) the poets of France warbled dirges to
his remains.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE FLEMISH ASCENDANCY: I43O-I59O</li>
</ol>
<p>The songs and dances of the people were the perennial fountain from
which nonecclesiastical forms of music took their origin, moods, and
themes, and even Masses might stem from such ditties as Adieu mes
amours. The chansons of France ranged from the lilting lays of street
singers and the bal- lads of troubadours to the intricate polyphonic
chants of Guillaume de Machaut and Josquin Depres.</p>
<p>Machaut ( c . 1300-77) was the lord of that ars nova which Philippe
de Vitry had expounded in 1 3 2 5 — music using binary rhythms in
addition to the triple rhythms sanctioned by the ars antiqua and the
Church. Machaut was</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>774</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>poet, a scholar, a musician, a canon of Reims Cathedral, probably
also a man of ardor, for he wrote some amorous lyrics whose warmth has
not yet cooled. He excelled in a dozen musical forms — ballads,
roundels, virelays, motets, Masses; to him we trace the oldest
polyphonic Mass composed by one man. Though an ecclesiastic, he shared
in the movement to secularize poly- phonic music, to lead it from the
orthodox rhythms of the motet and the High Mass to the freer, more
flexible cantilena of secular song.</p>
<p>In those centuries the English were musical. They did not rival the
Italians in melody (who has? ) , nor the Flemings in polyphony, but
their songs now and then touched a strain of tenderness and delicacy
equaled only in the profoundest French chansons. English singers were
acclaimed at the Coun- cil of Constance, and in that generation Henry V,
hero of Agincourt, com- posed a Mass whose Gloria and Sanctus are still
preserved. The compositions of John Dunstable ( c . 1370-1453) were sung
from Scotland to Rome, and played a part in forming the style of the
Flemish school.</p>
<p>As Flanders had set the pace in painting in the fifteenth century, so
it was there, in a milieu of prosperous and art-loving nobles and
burghers, that music had one of its most exuberant periods. “Today,”
wrote Johannes Ver- were about 1490, “we have blossoming forth, quite
apart from a large num - ber of famous singers … an almost unlimited
number of composers” whose works “excel in pleasant sound; I never hear
or look at their compositions without rejoicing in the m.” 7
Contemporaries would probably have ranked Dufay, Okeghem, and Depres
quite on a par with Jan van Eyck, Claus Sluter, and Rogier van der
Weyden in the hierarchy of genius and benefi- cence. Here, in Flemish
polyphony, Western Europe lived the last phase of the Gothic spirit in
art — religious devotion tempered with secular gaiety, forms firm in
base and structure, fragile and delicate in development and ornament.
Even Italy, so hostile to Gothic, joined Western Europe in ac-
knowledging the supremacy of Flemish music, and in seeking maestri from
Flanders for episcopal choirs and princely courts. Emperor Maximilian I,
enchanted by the music of Brussels, formed a choir in Vienna on Flemish
models. Charles V took Flemish musicians to Spain; Archduke Ferdinand
took some to Austria, Christian II others to Denmark; “the fountain of
music,” said the Venetian Cavallo, “is in the Netherlands.” 8 Through
this Flemish ascendancy professional music escaped the narrowing
nationalism of the age.</p>
<p>Guillaume Dufay led the way. Born in Hainaut ( c . 1399), trained as
a boy chorister in the cathedral of Cambrai, he was called to Rome to
sing in the Sistine Chapel; then, back in Cambrai, he raised its choir
to interna- tional renown; the Masses that he composed there were sung
in all the mu- sical centers of Latin Christendom. Those that survive
sound heavy and slow to ears alert to the light celerity of modern life,
yet they may have fitted</p>
<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIV)</p>
<p>775</p>
<p>well in stately cathedrals or solemn papal choirs. More to our mood
is a polyphonic song of mellifluous melancholy, Le jour s’endort — “The
day is going to sleep.” We picture a robed chorus singing such a chant
in the Gothic halls of Cambrai, Ypres, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, or
Dijon, and we perceive that the architecture, painting, costumes, music,
and manners of that warm and colorful and pompous age made a harmonious
artistic whole, being themselves variations on one pervasive theme.</p>
<p>Dufay’s methods were developed, and were broadcast through Europe, by
the most influential musical teacher of perhaps any time. Johannes Okeg-
hem, born in Flanders ( c . 1430), spent most of his years providing
music, and musical education, at the court of France. His special
passion was for the “canon”— a form of fugue in which the words and
melody sung by the first voice were repeated, several bars later, by a
second voice, later by a third, and so on, in a flowing counterpoint
whose laborious complexity challenged the singers and charmed the
composers. These ran to him from every Roman Catholic land to learn and
carry off his skill. “Through his pupils,” wrote an old historian, “the
art” of contrapuntal and “canonical” pol yphony “was transplanted into
all countries; and he must be regarded— for it can be proved by
〔stylistic〕 genealogy — as the founder of all schools from his own to
the present age”; 9 but since this was written in 1833, Okeg - hem
cannot be held responsible for twentieth-century music. At his death
(1495) the musicians of Europe wrote motets to his memory, and Erasmus a
“Lamentation.” The names of even the “immortals” are writ in water.</p>
<p>His pupils became the musical leaders of the next generation. Coming
from Hainaut to Paris, Josquin Depres spent years studying with Okeghem,
then served as maestro di capella — “master of the chapel” choir— in
Florence, Milan, and Ferrara. For Duke Ercole I he wrote a Miserere that
soon re- sounded throughout Western Europe. After six years in the
Sistine Chapel Choir he returned to Paris (1494) to serve as mcatre de
chapelle for Louis XII. One of his noblest works was his Deploration de
Jehan Okeghem, a dirge for his dead teacher. For a time he followed him
in composing Masses and motets in canonic style, piling voice upon voice
in almost mathematical problems of sequence and harmony. When his skill
was complete, and his supremacy in “art music” was un questioned, he
tired of technique, and wrote motets, hymns, and secular songs in a
simpler harmonic style, in which the music followed and illuminated the
words instead of torturing them on a Protean canon, or stretching a
syllable into a song. When both teacher and pupil were gone it became
customary to call Okeghem the Donatello, Depres the Michelangelo, of
musical art.</p>
<p>The French court cultivated music as the finest flower of wealth and
power. A lovely tapestry dated about 1500, and now in the Musee des
Gobelins at Paris, pictures four women, three youths, and a bald
monk</p>
<p>7j6 the reformation (chap, xxxiv</p>
<p>grouped in a garden around a fountain; one lad is playing a lute, a
girl plays a viol, a staid lady plays a portable organ. French poets
intended their lyrics to be sung; an Academie du Palais devoted itself
to promoting the union between music and poetry; and even now one
without the other seems in- complete. Clement Jannequin, a pupil of
Depres’, excelled in descriptive chansons; his Chant de Valouette, or
“Song of the Lark” (1521), still warbles over several continents.</p>
<p>Spanish music reflected the piety and gallantry of the people. Cross-
fertilized by Arabic, Italian, Provengal, French, and Flemish
influences, this art ranged from melancholy Morisco monodies to stately
polyphonic Masses in the Flemish style. One of the greatest composers of
the sixteenth century, Cristobal Morales, carried polyphony to high
excellence, and transmitted his art to his more famous pupil, Tomas Luis
de Victoria. By contrast the Arabic heritage produced just the strains
to fit the lute. Luis de Milan and Miguel de Fuenllana composed for the
vihuela — and performed on it — songs that rivaled the German Lieder in
range and power.</p>
<p>The conquest of Italy by Flemish musicians continued to the rise of
Pales- trina. Heinrich Ysaac, after absorbing the contrapuntal art in
Flanders, was brought to Florence by Lorenzo de’ Medici to teach II
Magnifico’s children; he stayed there fourteen years , and composed
music for Lorenzo’s songs. Disturbed by the French invasion of Italy, he
passed into the service of Maximilian I at Innsbruck, where he shared in
giving form to the Lieder. In 1502 he returned to Italy, pensioned by
the Emperor and his former pupil, Leo X. His Masses, motets, and songs —
above all his Choralis Constantinus, fifty-eight four-part settings for
the Offices of the Mass throughout the reli- gious year — were ranked
with the highest music of the age.</p>
<p>Orlando di Lasso brought the Flemish school to its culmination, and
illus- trated, in his triumphant career, the geographical range and
rising social status of Renaissance musicians. As a boy chorister in his
native Hainaut, he so fascinated his hearers that he was twice abducted
by those who hoped to profit from his voice; finally, in his fifteenth
year (1545?) his parents allowed Ferdinand Gonzaga to take him to Italy.
At the age of twenty-three he became choirmaster in the church of
St. John Lateran in Rome. In 1555 he settled in Antwerp, and published
his First Book of Italian Madrigals, secular lyrics dressed in all the
frills of Flemish counterpoint. In the same year he issued a miscellany
of villanelles (songs of Neapolitan origin), French chansons, and four
religious motets; this collection well reflected the judicious
oscillation of Di Lasso’s life between profane enjoyment and melo -
dious penitence. We get a glimpse of his environment at Antwerp in the
dedication of a motet to Cardinal Pole, and another to Cardinal
Granvelle, minister to Philip II in the Netherlands. Probably it was
Granvelle who arranged the young composer’s engagement to assist in
directing the</p>

<p>ducal choir at Munich (1556). Orlando came to like Bavaria as much as
Italy, took his wife from one as he had taken his name from the other,
and served the Bavarian dukes till his death.</p>
<p>This happy Mozart of the sixteenth century doubled the 626
compositions of his counterpart. He traversed the whole gamut of current
musical forms, and in each won European renown. He seemed equally at
home in madrigals of refined love, chansons of amorous levity, and
Masses of mystic piety. In 1563 he was made Kapellmeister. Now he
composed for Albert V a musical setting of the seven Penitential Psalms.
The Duke so admired these composi- tions that he engaged artists to
transcribe them on parchment, adorn them with miniatures, and bind them
in red morocco in two folio volumes which are today among the most
prized possessions of the state library in art-loving Munich.</p>
<p>All Europe solicited the new star. When Di Lasso visited Paris
(1571), Charles IX offered him 1,200 livres (0,000?) per year to stay;
he refused, but presented Charles and Catherine de Medicis with a book
of French chansons, the most melodious, said Brantome, that Paris had
ever heard. One song chanted the praises of the French capital for its
love of justice and peace — a year before the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew. Returning to Munich, Di Lasso dedicated to the Fuggers
a collection of Latin motets, Italian madrigals, German Lieder, and
French chansons; this composer was no romantic starveling but a man
adept in the ways of the world. In 1 574 he traveled to Rome at Duke
Albert’s expense, gave Gregory XIII a volume of Masses, and received the
Order of the Golden Spur. Even God appreci- ated Orlando’s dedications;
for when, on Corpus Christi day (1584), a severe storm threatened to
cancel the usual religious procession through the stree ts of Munich,
the rain stopped and the sun came out as Orlando’s motet, Gustate et
videte — “Taste and see how gracious the Lord is”— was sung by his
choir; and every year thereafter, on Corpus Christi, the same music was
sung to ensure propitious skies.</p>
<p>In 1585 Di Lasso, aging and repentant, published his Fifth Book of
Madri- gals, in which he applied the form to spiritual themes; these are
among his most moving compositions. Five years later his mind began to
fail; he could no longer recognize his wife, and talked of almost
nothing but death, the Last Judgment, and an increase in salary. He
received the increase, and died triumphant and insane ( 1 594) .</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MUSIC AND THE REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The Reformation was a revolution in music as well as in theology,
ritual, ethics, and art. Catholic liturgy was aristocratic, a stately
ceremonial rooted</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>778</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIV</p>
<p>in inviolable tradition and standing frankly above the people in
language, vestments, symbols, and music. In that spirit the clergy
defined itself as the Church, and thought of the people as a flock to be
shepherded into morality and salvation by myth, legend, sermon, drama,
and all the arts. In that spirit the Mass was an esoteric mystery, a
miraculous intercourse of the priest with God, and the music of the Mass
was sung by the priest and a male choir set apart from the worshipers.
But in the Reformation the middle classes asserted themselves; the
people became the Church, the clergy became their ministers, the
language of the service was to be the vernacular of the nation, the
music was to be intelligible, and in it the congregation would take an
active, finally a leading, role.</p>
<p>Luther loved music, appreciated polyphony and counterpoint, and wrote
enthusiastically in 1538:</p>
<p>When natural music is sharpened and polished by art, then one be-</p>
<p>gins to see with amazement the great and perfect wisdom of God in His
wonderful work of music, where one voice takes a simple part</p>
<p>and around it sing three, four, or five other voices, leaping,
springing round about, marvelously gracing the simple part, like a
square dance in heaven. . . . He who does not find this an inexpressible
miracle of</p>
<p>the Lord is truly a clod, and is not worthy to be considered a man.
10</p>
<p>At the same time he aspired to a religious music that would move the
people by its fusion of faith with song. In 1524 he collaborated with
Johann Wal- ther, Kapellmeister to the Elector Frederick the Wise, to
produce the first Protestant hymnal, which was expanded and improved
through many edi- tions. The words were taken partly from Catholic
hymns, partly from the songs of the Meistersinger, partly from Luther’s
own rough ly poetic pen, partly from folk songs transfonned to religious
themes; “the Devil,” said Luther, “has no right to all the good tunes.”
11 Some of the music was com - posed by Luther, some by Walther, some
was adapted from current Catholic settings. Lutheran churches continued
for almost a century to include poly- phonic Masses in their ritual; but
gradually Latin was replaced by the ver- nacular, the role of the Mass
was reduced, singing by the congregation was extended, and the chants of
the choir moved away from counterpoint to an easier harmonic form in
which the music sought to follow and interpret the words. From the choir
music composed by Luther and his aides to accom- pany the recitation of
Gospel narratives came the noble Protestant church music of the
eighteenth century, culminating in the oratorios of Handel and the
Masses, oratorios, and chorales of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>Not all the founders of Protestantism were so favorable to music as
Luther. Zwingli, though himself a musician, excluded music altogether
from the religious service, and Calvin forbade any church music except
unisonal</p>

<p>singing by the congregation. But he allowed polyphonic song in the
home; and his Huguenot followers in France took part of their strength
and cour- age from family singing of hymns and Psalms set to music for
several voices. When Clement Marot translated the Psalms into French
verse Calvin so liked the result that he condoned the polyphonic
settings arranged by Claude Goudimel, and the fact that this Protestant
composer was slain in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew made his Psalter a
doubly holy book. A century after Marot a Catholic bishop expressed his
envy of the role these translations and settings had played in the
French Reformation. “To know these Psalms by heart is, among the
Huguenots, a sign of the communion to which they belong; and in the
towns in which they are most numerous the airs may be heard coming from
the mouths of artisans, and, in the coun- try, from those of tillers of
the soil.” 12 The democratization of religious music marked the lands of
the Reformation, covering the darkness of the creed with the releasing
joy of song.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church remained the chief patron of music, as of the
other arts. North of the Alps Catholic music proceeded along the lines
set by the Flemish School. This tradition was confirmed by Ysaac in
Austria, and by Di Lasso in Bavaria. One of Luther’s most generous
letters was addressed (1530) to Ludwig Send, complimenting him on the
music he was compos- ing at Munich, and praising the Catholic dukes
there because “they cultivate and honor music.” 13</p>
<p>The choir of the Sistine Chapel was still the model on which kings
and princes established their “chapels” in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. Even among Protestants the highest form of musical
composition was the Mass, and the crowning glory of a Mass was to be
sung by the papal choir. The supreme ambition of a singer was to join
that choir, which was there- fore able to include the best male voices
in Western Europe. Castrati — then called eunuchi — were first admitted
to the Sistine Choir about 1550; soon afterward some appeared at the
Bavarian court. The emasculation was per- formed on consenting boys who
were persuaded that their soprano voices would be a greater asset to
them than fertility — a vulgar virtue generally sup- plied beyond
demand.</p>
<p>Like any old and complex institution, which has so much to lose by an
un- successful innovation, the Church was conservative, even more in
ritual than in creed. Composers, on the contrary, were weary of old
modes, as they have been in all ages, and experiment was to them the
life of their art. All through these centuries the Church struggled to
prevent the artificiality of the ars</p>

<p>780</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>nova, and the subtlety of Flemish counterpoint, from weakening the
dignity and grandeur of the High Mass. In 1322 Pope John XXII issued a
stern decree against musical novelties and decoration, and ordered that
the music of the Mass should keep to unisonal plain song, the Gregorian
chant, as its foundation, and permit only such harmony as would be
intelligible to wor- shipers, and would deepen rather than distract
piety. The order was obeyed for a century; then it was evaded by having
some of the performers sing the bass part an octave higher than written;
this faulx bourdon — false bass — be- came a favorite ruse in France.
Complexities in Mass music developed again. Five, six, or eight parts
were sung in fugue and counterpoint, in which the words of the liturgy
ran upon one another’s heels in professional confu - sion, or were
drowned in musical flourishes sometimes inserted by the singers ad
libitum. The custom of adapting popular tunes into a Mass led even to
the intrusion of profane words into the sacred text. Some Masses came to
be known from their secular sources, like The Mass of Farewell My Loves,
or The Mass in the Shadow of the Bush . 14 The liberal Erasmus was
himself so disgusted with the artificiality of “art Masses” that he
protested, in a note to his edition of the New Testament:</p>
<p>Modern church music is so constructed that the congregation can-</p>
<p>not hear one distinct word. The choristers themselves do not under-
stand what they are singing. . . . There was no 〔church〕 music in</p>
<p>St. Paul’s time. Words were then pronounced plainly. Words nowa -</p>
<p>days mean nothing. . . . Men leave their work and go to church to</p>
<p>listen to more noises than were ever heard in Greek or Roman</p>
<p>theaters. Money must be made to buy organs and train boys to</p>
<p>squeal. 16</p>
<p>In this matter the reform party within the Church agreed with
Erasmus. Bishop Giberti of Verona forbade the use of amorous songs or
popular melo- dies in the churches of his diocese, and Bishop Morone of
Modena prohibited all “figured” music— i.e., music adorned with the
elaboration of motives or themes. At the Council of Trent the Catholic
reformers urged the exclusion of all polyphonic music from church
services, and a return to monodic Gre- gorian chant. The predilection of
Pope Pius IV for Palestrina’s Masses may have helped to save the day for
Catholic polyphony.</p>
<p>Giovanni Luigi Palestrina took his name from a little city in the
Roman Campagna, which in ancient days had entered history as Praeneste.
In 1537 we find him listed, at the age of eleven, among the choirboys at
Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He was not yet twenty-one when he was
appointed choirmaster in the cathedral of his native town. So
established, he married (1547) Lucrezia di Goris, a woman of helpful but
moderate means. When the bishop of Palestrina became Julius III he
brought his choirmaster to</p>
<p>MUSIC</p>
<p>CHAP, xxxrv)</p>
<p>781</p>
<p>Rome, and made him head of the Cappell a Giulia, in St. Peter’s,
which trained singers for the Sistine Chapel. To the new Pope the young
composer dedicated his First Book of Masses (1554), one of which
presented a three- voice counterpoint accompaniment to one voice in
plain song. The Pope liked these Masses enough to give Palestrina
membership in the Sistine Choir. As a married man Giovanni’s position in
this usually tonsured group seemed irregular, and evoked some
opposition. Palestrina was about to dedicate a book of madrigals to the
Pope when Julius died ( 1555) .</p>
<p>Marcellus II lived only three weeks after his elevation to the
papacy. To his memory the composer dedicated (1 555) his famous Missa
Papae Mar- celli, which was not published or so named till 1567. Pope
Paul IV, a man of inflexible and puritan principles, dismissed the three
married members from the Sistine Choir, allotting each a small pension.
Palestrina was soon made choirmaster at St. John Lateran, but this
position, though it buttered his bread, offered no patronage to cover
the expense of publishing musical compositions. With the accession of
Pius IV (1559) papal favor returned. Pius was impressed by the
Improperia that Palestrina wrote for the Good Friday service, and from
that time this composition became a regular part of that ritual in the
Sistine Chapel. Palestrina’s marriage still excluded him from the
Sistine Choir, but his status rose with his appointment (1561) as
choirmaster at Santa Maria Maggiore.</p>
<p>A year later the reassembled Council of Trent took up the problem of
adjusting church music to the new spirit of reform. The extreme proposal
to forbid polyphony altogether was rejected; a compromise measure was
passed urging ecclesiastical authorities to “exclude from churches all
such music as . . . introduces anything of the impure or lascivious, in
order that the house of God may truly be seen to be . . . the house of
prayer.” * Pius IV appointed a committee of eight cardinals to implement
this decree in the diocese of Rome. A pleasant story relates that the
commission was on the verge of banning polyphonic music when one member,
Cardinal Charles Borromeo, appealed to Palestrina to compose a Mass that
would show the full congruity of polyphony and piety; that Palestrina
wrote, and a choir sang, for the commission, three Masses, one of them
the Missa Papae Mar- celli, and that the profound union of religious
elevation and chastened musical artistry in these Masses saved polyphony
from condemnation. How- ever, the Mass of Pope Marcellus was already ten
years old, and the only known connection of Palestrina with this
commission is its extension of his pension. 16 We may none the less
believe that the music which Palestrina had presented in the choirs of
Rome — by its fidelity to the words, its avoidance of secular motives,
and the subordination of musical art to religious intent —</p>
<p>Pius X (1903) and Pius XII (1955) f*it it necessary to repeat these
instructions.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>782</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXIV</p>
<p>played a part in leading the committee to sanction polyphonic music.
17 It was an added argument for polyphony that Palestrina’s
ecclesiastical com - positions normally dispensed with instrumental
adornment, and were almost always written a cappella — “in chapel
style”— i.e., for voices alone. In 1 57 1 Palestrina was again made
choirmaster of the Cappella Giulia, and ne kept this post till his
death. Meanwhile he composed with uncontrollable fertility — in all,
ninety-three Masses, 486 antiphons, offertories, motets, and psalms, and
a great number of madrigals. Some of these were on secular themes, but
as Palestrina aged he turned even this form to religious purposes. His
First Book of Spiritual Madrigals (1581) includes some of his most beau-
tiful chants. Personal misfortunes may have colored his music. In 1576
his son Angelo died, leaving to his care two beloved grandchildren, who
died a few years later. Another son died about 1 579, and in 1580 the
death of his wife moved the composer to think of becoming a monk.
However, he mar- ried again within a year.</p>
<p>The astonishing abundance and quality of Palestrina’s product raised
him to the leadership of Italian, if not of all European, music. His
setting of the Song of Solomon to twenty-nine motets (1584), his
Lamentations of Jere- rmah (1588), his Stabat Mater and Magnificat
(1590) confirmed his reputa- tion and his persisting power. In 1592 his
Italian competitors joined in presenting him with a Collection of Vesper
Psalms honoring him as the “common father of all musicians.” On January
1, 1594, he dedicated to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany a Second
Book of Spiritual Madrigals, combining again religious devotion with
musical mastery. A month later he died, in the sixty-ninth year of his
age. His tomb bore under his name the title he had earned, Musicae
Princeps, Prince of Music.</p>
<p>We must not expect to appreciate Palestrina today unless, ourselves
in a religious mood, we hear his music in its proper setting as part of
some solemn ritual; and even there its technical aspects may leave us
more marveling than moved. In a literal sense the proper setting can
never return, for it was music of the Catholic Reformation, the somber
tone of a stern reaction against the sensuous joyousness of the pagan
Renaissance. It was Michelangelo surviv- ing Raphael, Paul IV replacing
Leo X, Loyola displacing Bembo, Calvin succeeding Luther. Our current
preferences are a transient and fallible norm; and an individual’s
taste— especially if he be lacking in technical competence,</p>

<p>change. Who knows but some not very distant age, tiring of orchestral
sonorities and operatic romances, may find again in such music as
Palestrina’s a depth of feeling, a profound and placid flow of harmony,
better fitted to express the soul of man cleansed of pride in reason and
power, and standing again humble and fearful before the engulfing
infinite.</p>
