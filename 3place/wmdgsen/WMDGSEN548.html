Reynolds</h4>
<p>1 75 6 - 9 °</p>
<p>I. THE MUSICIANS</p>
<p>T HIS England loved great music, but could not produce it.</p>
<p>Appreciation abounded. In Zoffany’s picture The Copper and Gore</p>
<p>Families we see the part that music played in cultivated homes. We
hear of the hundreds of singers and performers that were brought
together for the Handel Commemoration Concert in 1784. The Morning
Chronicle of De- cember 30, 1790, announced, for the ensuing months, a
series of “Profes - sional Concerts,” another of “Ancient Concerts,”
“Ladies’ Subscription Concerts” for Sunday evenings, oratorios twice a
week, and six symphony concerts to be conducted by the composer himself
— Joseph Haydn; 1 this rivaled the musical wealth of London today. Just
as Venice made choirs from orphans, so the “Charity Children” of
St. Paul’s Cathed ral gave annual performances, of which Haydn wrote,
“No music has ever moved me so much in my life.” 2 Concerts and light
operas were presented in the Ranelagh Rotunda and the Marylebone
Gardens. A dozen societies of amateur musi- cians gave public
performances. The English predilection for music was so widely known
that a score of virtuosos and composers came to the island — Geminiani,
Mozart, Haydn, Johann Christian Bach; and Bach remained.</p>
<p>The taste for serious opera declined in England after Han del’s
surfeit. Some enthusiasm returned when Giovanni Manzuoli opened the 1764
season in Ezio; Burney described his voice as “the most powerful and
voluminous soprano that has been heard on our stage since Farinelli.” 3
This was appar - ently the last triumph of Italian opera in England in
that century. When the Italian opera house in London was burned down
(1789), Horace Walpole rejoiced, and hoped it would never be rebuilt.
4</p>
<p>If there were now no memorable British composers, there were two emi-
nent historians of music, whose works appeared in the same year, 1776 —
the annus mirabile of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and The
Wealth of Nations, not to speak of the American Declaration of Independ-
ence. Sir John Hawkins’ five - volume General History of the Science and
Practise of Music was a work of careful scholarship, and though he
himself — attorney and magistrate — was not a musician, his appraisals
have stood well amid the flux of critical opinion. Charles Burney was
organist at S t. Paul’s and the most sought-for musical teacher in
England. His handsome face and amiable personality, added to his
accomplishments, won him the friendship</p>

<p>THE AGE OF REYNOLDS</p>
<p>747</p>
<p>of Johnson, Garrick, Burke, Sheridan, Gibbon, and Reynolds — who made
an attractive portrait of him gratis. 5 He traveled through France,
Germany, Austria, and Italy to get materials for his General History of
Music, and spoke with firsthand knowledge of the leading composers who
were then alive. About 1780 he reported that “old musicians complain of
the extrava - gance of the young, and these again of the dryness and
inelegance of the</p>

<li>THE ARCHITECTS</li>
</ol>
<p>English builders now offered a lively contest between Gothic and
classical revivals. The grandeur of the old cathedrals, the vestigial
splendor of stained glass, the ivied ruins of medieval abbeys in
Britain, stirred the imagination to idealize the Middle Ages, and fell
in with the developing Romantic reaction against classic couplets, cold
columns, and oppressive pediments. Horace Walpole engaged a succession
of second-rate architects to rebuild his “Strawberry Hill” at Twickenham
in Gothic form and ornament (1748 - 7 3 ) ; he gave years of finical
care to making his home the very palladium of the anti-Palladian style.
Year after year he added rooms, until there were twenty- two; one, “the
Gallery,” housing his art collections, was fifty -six feet long. Too
often he used lath and plaster instead of stone; even a first glance
reveals a fragility forgivable in interior decoration but unpardonable
in external structure. Selwyn called Strawberry Hill “gingerbread
Gothic,” 7 and another wit reckoned that Walpole had outlived three sets
of crenellated battlements, 8 which had to be repeatedly restored.</p>
<p>Despite these experiments, Palladio and Vitruvius remained the
tutelar deities of English architecture in the second as in the first
half of the eight- eenth century. The classic spirit was reinforced by
the excavations at Her- culaneum and Pompeii, and it was spread by
descriptions of classic ruins in Athens, Palmyra, and Baalbek. Sir
William Chambers defended the Palladian view in his Treatise on Civil
Architecture (1759), and added example to pre- cept by rebuilding
Somerset House (1776-86) with a vast fa9ade of Renais- sance windows and
Corinthian porticoes.</p>
<p>A remarkable family of four brothers, John, Robert, James, and
William Adam, came out of Scotland to dominate English architecture in
this half century. Robert left the strongest impress upon his time.
After studying in the University of Edinburgh he spent three years in
Italy, where he met Piranesi and Winckelmann. Noting that the private
palaces praised by Vi- truvius had disappeared from the Roman scene, and
learning that one re- mained relatively intact, the palace of Diocletian
at Spalato (now Split in Yugoslavia), he made his way to that ancient
Dalmatian capital, spent five weeks making measurements and drawings,
was arrested as a spy, was freed, wrote a book about his researches, and
came back to England resolved to use Roman styles in British building.
In 1768 he and his brothers leased for ninety-nine years a tract of
sloping land between the Strand and the Thames,</p>
<p>748</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXand erected on it the famous Adelphi Terrace — a district of fine
streets and handsome houses on an embankment supported by massive Roman
arches and vaults; here some dramatic notables lived, from Garrick to
Bernard Shaw. Robert designed also some famous mansions, like Bute’s
Luton Hoo (i.e., house at Luton, thirty miles north of London). “This,”
said Johnson, “is one of the places I do not regret having come to see”;
9 and he was hard to please.</p>
<p>By and large the classic orders won the battle against the Gothic
revival. Many of the great palaces of this age, like Carlton House in
London and Harewood House in Yorkshire, were in the neoclassic style.
Walpole did not live to see Gothic return in triumph and splendor in the
Houses of Par- liament (1840-60).</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>WEDGWOOD</li>
</ol>
<p>The Adam brothers were not content with designing buildings and in-
teriors; they built some of the loveliest furniture of the time. But the
great name here is Thomas Chippendale. In 1754, at th e age of
thirty-six, he pub- lished The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker’s Director,
which was to the art of furniture what Reynolds’ Discourses were to
painting. His characteristic products were chairs with slim “ribbon
backs” and charming legs. But also he delighted the lords and ladies of
George Ill’s reign with cabinets, writing tables, commodes, bookcases,
mirrors, tables, and fourposter beds — all ele- gant, mostly novel,
generally frail.</p>
<p>The frailty continued in the work of Chippendale’s rival, George
Hepple - white, and their successor, Thomas Sheraton; they seemed
converted to Burke’s theory that in art, as in life, beauty must be
frail. Sheraton carried</p>
<p>They were giving a lead to the French in designing gardens and parks.
Lancelot B rown earned the nickname “Capability” because he was so quick
to see the “capabilities” offered by his clients’ grounds for fantastic—
and ex- pensive-designs; in this spirit he laid out gardens at Blenheim
and Kew. The fashion in gardens ran now to the exotic, unexpected, or
picturesque. Minia- ture Gothic temples and Chinese pagodas were used as
outdoor ornaments; Sir William Chambers, in decorating the Kew Gardens
(1757-62), intro- duced Gothic shrines, Moorish mosques, and Chinese
pagodas. Funerary urns were favorite garden glories, sometimes holding
the ashes of departed friends.</p>
<p>The ceramic arts had an almost revolutionary development. England was
producing glass as fine as any in Europe. 10 The Chelsea and Derby
potteries turned out delightful figures in porcelain, usually in the
styles of Sevres. But</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REYNOLDS</p>
<p>749</p>
<p>he busiest ceramic center was the “Five Towns” in Staffordshire—
chiefly Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent. Before Josiah Wedgwood the industry
was poor in methods and earnings; the potters were coarse and
letterless; when Wesley first preached to them they pelted him with mud;
their houses were huts, and their market was restricted by impassable
roads. In 1755 a rich deposit of kaolin — hard white clay like that used
by the Chinese — was discov- ered in Cornwall; but that was two hundred
miles from the Five Towns.</p>
<p>Wedgwood began at the age of nine (1739) to work at the potter’s
wheel. He received little schooling, but he read much; and his study of
Caylus’ Recueil (Tantiquites egyptiennes , etrusques , grecques ,
romaines , et gauloises (1752-67) inspired him with ambition to
reproduce and rival classic ceramic forms. In 1753 he started his own
business at the Ivy House Works, and built around it, near Burslem, a
town which he called Etruria. He attacked with the energy of a warrior
and the vision of a statesman the conditions that hampered the industry.
He arranged better transport for the kaolin of Cornwall to his
factories; he campaigned — and helped to pay — for the im- provement of
roads and the building of canals; he was resolved to open ave- nues from
the Five Towns to the world. Heretofore the English market for fine
pottery had been dominated by Meissen, Delft, and Sevres; Wedgwood
captured the domestic, then much of the foreign, trade; by 1763 his pot-
teries were annually exporting 550,000 pieces to the Continent and North
America. Catherine the Great ordered a dinner set of a thousand
pieces.</p>
<p>By 1785 the Staffordshire potteries were employing fifteen thousand
workers. Wedgwood introduced specialization of labor, established
factory discipline, paid good wages, built schools and libraries. He
insisted on good workmanship; an early biographer described him as
stamping about his shops on his wooden leg, and breaking with his own
hand any pot that showed the least flaw; usually, in such cases, he
chalked on the careless artisan’s bench the warning “This won’t do for
Josiah Wedgwood.” 11 He dev eloped preci- sion tools, and bought steam
engines to power his machines. As a result of his large-scale production
of commercial pottery, pewter went out of gen- eral use in England. His
output ranged from earthenware pipes for London drains to the most
exquisite vessels for Queen Charlotte. He divided his offerings between
“Useful” and “Ornamental.” For the latter he frankly imitated classic
models, as in his luxurious agate vases; but also he developed original
forms, especially the famous jasper ware with Greek figures deli- cately
embossed in white on a base of blue.</p>
<p>His interest and enthusiasm ranged far beyond pottery. In experiments
to find more satisfactory mixtures of earth and chemicals, and better
methods of firing, he invented a pyrometer for measuring high
temperatures; this and other researches won him entry into the Royal
Society (1783). He was an early member of the Society for the Abolition
of Slavery; he designed and made the seal. He campaigned for universal
male suffrage and parliamentary reform. He supported the American
colonies from the beginning to the end of their revolt. He hailed the
French Revolution as promising a happier and more prosperous France.</p>
<p>75 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXHe had the good sense to employ John Flaxman to provide new and
re- fined designs for his pottery. From this work Flaxman went on to
illustrate Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante with drawings based on the art of
the Greek vase painters. They are admirable in line, but, lacking body
and color, they are as attractive as a woman without flesh. Something of
this cold quality was carried into Flaxman’s sculpture, as in his
monument to Nelson in St. Paul’s; but in the marble Cupid and Marpessa
12 he achieved full -blooded forms in one of the best imitations of
classic statuary. Funerary monuments became his specialty; he raised
them to Chatterton at Bristol, to Reynolds in St. Paul’s, to Paoli in
Westminster Abbey. He served in England the same role as Canova in Italy
— the neoclassic attempt to recapture the smooth and voluptuous grace of
Praxiteles.</p>
<p>We find less beauty but more life in the portrait busts that Joseph
Nolle- kens made of famous Englishmen. Born in London of Flemish
parents, he studied there till he was twenty-three, then went to Rome.
He lived and worked there for ten years, selling real and counterfeit
antiques. 13 Returning to England, he made so successful a bust of
George III that he was soon in general demand. Sterne, Garrick, Fox,
Pitt II, and Johnson sat for him, some- times to their sorrow, for
Nollekens carved no compliments. Johnson grum- bled that the sculptor
had made him look as if he had taken physic. 14</p>
<p>It was an age of popular engravers. The public was intensely
interested in the powerful personalities that trod the political and
other stages; prints of their figures and faces were scattered
throughout England. James Gill- ray’s caricatures were almost as lethal
as the letters of Junius; Fox confessed that such drawings did him “more
mischief than the debates in Parliament.” 15 Thomas Rowlandson
caricatured men as beasts, but also he drew pleasant landscapes, and he
amused several generations with his T ours of Dr. Syntax. Paul Sandby
and Edmund Dayer developed water color to almost finished
excellence.</p>
<p>Britons returning from the grand tour brought back prints,
engravings, paintings, and other works of art. The appreciation of art
spread; artists multiplied, raised their heads, their fees, and their
status; some were knighted. The Society for the Encouragement of Art,
Manufacture, and Commerce f 1 754) gave good sums in prizes to native
artists, and presented exhibitions. The British Museum opened its
collections in 1759. In 1761 a separate Soci- ety of Arts began annual
displays. Soon it divided into conservatives and innovators. The
conservatives, formed the Royal Academy of London, with a charter and £
5,000 from George III, and made Joshua Reynolds its presi- dent for
twenty-three years. The great age of English painting began.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>JOSHUA REYNOLDS</li>
</ol>
<p>Richard Wilson led the way. Son of a Welsh clergyman, he came to Lon-
don at fifteen, and made a living by painting portraits. In 1749 he went
to Italy; there and in France he absorbed the heritage of Nicolas
Poussin and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REYNOLDS</p>
<p>75 1</p>
<p>Claude Lorrain, and learned to value historical and landscape
painting above portraiture. Back in England, he painted landscapes
luminous with atmos- phere but cluttered with gods, goddesses, and other
classic ruins. Especially beautiful is The Thames at Twickenham , 16
which catches the spirit of an English summer day — bathers lolling,
trees and sailboats hardly moved by the quiet breeze. But the English
would not buy landscapes; they wanted portraits to preserve their faces
in their prime. Wilson persisted. He lived in poverty in a
half-furnished room in Tottenham Court Road, and sweetened his
bitterness with alcohol. In 1776 the Royal Academy rescued him by mak-
ing him its librarian. The death of a brother left him a small property
in Wales; he spent his final years there in such obscurity that no
journal men- tioned his death (1782).</p>
<p>By contrast the career of Reynolds was a lifelong pageant of honors
and prosperity. He was fortunate in being born (1723) to a Devonshire
clergy- man who kept a Latin school and loved books. Among these Joshua
found an Essay on the Whole Art… of Fainting (1719) by Jonathan Richard-
son. This inflamed him with a desire to be a painter, and his
sympathetic parents indulged his choice; they sent him to London to
study with Thomas Hudson, a Devon man who had married Richardson’s
daughter and was then the most courted portrait painter in England. In
1746 the father died, and the young artist set up house with his two
sisters in what is now Plymouth. In that famous port he met sailors and
commanders, painted their portraits, and made precious friendships. When
Captain Augustus Keppel was com- missioned to take gifts to the Dey of
Algiers he offered Joshua free passage to Minorca, for he knew that the
youth longed to study in Italy. From Mi- norca Reynolds made his way to
Rome ( 1750).</p>
<p>He remained in Italy three years, painting and copying. He labored to
discover the methods used by Michelangelo and Raphael in achieving line,
color, light, shade, texture, depth, expression, and mood. He paid a
price, for while copying Raphael in some unheated rooms of the Vatican
he caught a cold that apparently damaged his inner ear. Passing to
Venice, he studied Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, and learned how to
endow any sitter with the dignity of a doge. On his way home he stopped
for a month in Paris, but he found contemporary French painting too
feminine for his taste. After a month in Devon he established himself
with his sister Frances in London (1753), and remained there for the
rest of his life.</p>
<p>Almost at once he caught attention with another portrait of Captain
Kep- pel 17 — handsome, eager, masterful; here the Vandyck tradition was
restored to make portraits as resplendent images of aristocracy. Within
two years Reynolds had received 120 sitters, and was recognized as the
finest painter in England. His facility was his limitation. He became so
absorbed and ex- pert in portraiture that he lacked the time and skill
for historical, mythologi- cal, or religious pictures. He did well a
few, like The Holy Family and The Three Graces , 18 but his inspiration
was not in them. Nor did his patrons want such pictures; they were
nearly all Protestants, who discountenanced religious paintings as
encouraging idolatry; they loved nature, but as an ad-</p>
<p>75 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXjunct to their personalities or their hunts; they wished to see
themselves age- less on their walls, impressing themselves upon
posterity. So they came to Reynolds, two thousand of them, and they sent
him their wives and children, sometimes their dogs. Non e went away
grieved, for Reynolds’ amiable imagination could always supply what
nature had failed to give.</p>
<p>Never has a generation or a class been so fully preserved as in
Reynolds’ 630 surviving portraits. Here are the statesmen of that lusty
age: Bute in a splendor of color; 19 Burke rather somber for
thirty-eight; Fox potbellied, wistful, and noble at forty-four… Here are
the writers: Walpole, Sterne, Goldsmith 20 looking really like “Poor
Poll,” Gibbon with those fat cheeks which the Marquise du Deffand, who
could see only with her hands, mis- took for “the sitting part of a
child,” 21 and Boswell 22 as proud as if he had</p>
<p>Most numerous in this incomparable gallery are the aristocrats who
gave social order to an individualistic people, triumphant strategy to
foreign pol- icy, and a controlling constitution to the king. See them
first in their hand- some youth, like twelve-year-old Thomas Lister — a
picture which, as Reyn- old’s Brown Boy, challenges the Blue Boy of
Gainsborough. Many of them swelled in the girth when their dangerous
days were over, like that same Augustus Keppel who had been so
presentable as a captain in 1753, but was so full-filled as an admiral
in 1780. Despite such rotundities, and the silk and lace of their
investiture, Reynolds succeeded in transforming intangible courage and
pride into color and line. Take, as example, the powerful form and
personality of Lord Heathfield, bold in British red and holding the key
to Gibraltar, which he had invincibly defended against a four-year siege
by the Spanish and the French.</p>
<p>And so we come to those dial gynaikon, goddesses among women, whom
Reynolds found in the wives and daughters of the British aristocracy.
Un- married, he was free to love all of them with his eyes and brush, to
straighten their noses, refine their features, arrange their luxuriant
hair, and transfigure them with such fluffy, flowing raiment as would
make Venus long to be clothed. See Lady Elizabeth Keppel, Marchioness of
Tavistock, wearing the courtly robes she had worn years ago as
bridesmaid to Queen Charlotte; what would she be without those folds of
painted silk enveloping legs that, after all, could not be much
different from Xanthippe’s? Sometimes Reyn - olds tried what he could do
with a woman in simple garb; he pictured Mary Bruce, Duchess of
Richmond, dressed in a common cloak, and sewing a pattern into a
cushion; 25 this is a face that could haunt a philosopher’s dreams.
Almost as simple in dress and seraphic in profile is Mrs. Bouverie
listening to Mrs. Crewe. 26 There was a still profounder beauty in the
quiet and gentle face of Emma Gilbert, Countess of Mount Edgcumbe; 27

<p>lovely portrait was destroyed by enemy action in the Second World
War.</p>
<p>Nearly all these women had children, for part of the aristocratic
obliga- tion was to maintain the family and the property in undivided
continuity. So Reynolds painted Lady Elizabeth Spencer, Countess of
Pembroke, with her six-year-old son, Lord Herbert to be; 28 and
Mrs. Edward Bouverie with her three-year-old Georgiana; 29 and this
daughter, become Duchess of Devon- shire (the gay beauty who with kisses
bought votes for Fox in his campaign for Parliament), with her
three-year-old daughter, another Georgiana, the future Countess of
Carlisle. 30</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps the most attractive of all, the children
themselves, a full gallery of them, nearly all individualized as
unduplicable souls, and sym- pathetically understood in the insecurity
and wonderment of youth. The world knows Reynolds’ masterpiece in this
sector, The Age of Innocence , 31 which he painted in 1788, in the last
years of his vision; but how soon his understanding of childhood reached
an almost mystic intuition can be seen in his indescribably beautiful
portrait of Lord Robert Spencer, aged eleven, 32 painted in 1758.
Thereafter he painted them at every age: at age one Prin- cess Sophia
Matilda; at two years Master Wynn with his lamb; at three Miss Bowles
with her dog; at four Master Crewe in a perfect imitation of Henry VIII,
and, about the same age, the “Strawberry Girl”; 33 at five the Brum -
mell boys William and George (“Beau Brummel” to be); at six Prince</p>
<p>William Frederick; at seven Lord George Conway; at eight Lady
Caroline Howard; at nine Frederick, Earl of Carlisle; and so on to youth
and mar- riage and children.</p>
<p>Reynolds admitted that he preferred titled sitters; “the slow
progression of things naturally makes elegance and refinement the last
effect of opulence and power” 34 and only the rich could pay the £ 300
that he asked for “a whole length with two children.” 35 In any case he
had struck gold, and soon earned £ 1 6,000 a year. In 1760 he bought a
house at 17 Leicester Square, then the most select quarter of London; he
furnished it luxuriously, collected Old Masters, and took for his studio
a chamber as large as a ballroom. He had his own coach, with painted
panels and gilded wheels; he asked his sister to drive in it about town,
for he believed that such an advertisement of pros- perity would bring
more. 36 In 1761 he was knighted. He was received every- where, and
himself played host to genius, beauty, and class; he had more literary
men at his table than any other man in England. 37 To him Gold- smith
dedicated The Deserted Village , and Boswell the Life of Samuel Johnson.
It was Reynolds who in 1764 founded “The Club” to give Johnson a forum
of his peers.</p>
<p>He must have loved Johnson, he made so many portraits of him. He made
even more of himself. He was not blessed with good looks: his face was
florid and scarred by childhood smallpox; his features were blunt, his
upper lip had been disfigured by a fall in Minorca. At thirty he
pictured himself shading his eyes and trying to pierce a maze of light
and shade to catch the soul behind a face. 38 He painted himself at
fifty in his doctoral robes, 39 for Oxford had just made him a doctor of
civil law. Finest of the series is the</p>

<p>XXXportrait in the National Gallery, about 1775; his face is now more
refined, but his hair is gray and his hand is cupped to his ear, for he
was going deaf.</p>
<p>When the Royal Academy of Arts was founded in 1768 Reynolds was by
common consent made its president. For fifteen years he opened its sea-
sons with a discourse to the students. Boswell was among the friends who
sat in the front row at the first discourse (January 2, 1769). Many who
heard these addresses were surprised at their literary excellence; some
thought that Burke or Johnson had written them, but Sir Joshua had
learned much from his associations, and had developed a style, as well
as a mind, of his own. Nat- urally, as an Academician, he stressed the
importance of study; he depre- cated the notion that genius may dispense
with schooling and hard work; he derided “this phantom of inspiration,”
and insisted that “labor is the only price of solid fame.” 40
Furthermore, “every opportunity should be taken to discountenance that
false and vulgar opinion — that rules are the fetters of genius.” 41
There should be three stages in the normal development of an artist:
first, tutelage — learning the rules, draftsmanship, coloring, modeling;
second, studying those masters who have received the approbation of
time; through such studies “those perfections which lie scattered among
various masters are now united in one general idea, which is henceforth
to regulate the student’s taste and enlarge his imagination…. The third
and last pe- riod emancipates the student from subjection to any
authority but what he shall himself judge to be supported by reason.” 42
Only then should he inno - vate. “Having well established his judgment
and stored his memory, he may now without fear try the power of his
imagination. The mind that has been thus disciplined may be indulged in
the wildest enthusiasm, and venture to play on the borders of the
wildest extravagance.” 43</p>
<p>Hogarth had rejected the Old Masters as “Black Masters,” and had ad -
vised a realistic portrayal of nature. Reynolds thought that this should
be merely a preparation for a more idealistic art. “Nature herself is
not to be too closely copied…. The wish of the genuine painter must be
more extensive: instead of endeavoring to amuse mankind with the minute
neat- ness of his imitations, he must endeavor to improve them by the
grandeur of his ideas…. [He] must strive for fame by captivating the
imagination.” 44 Everything in nature is imperfect from the standpoint
of beauty, has in it some blemish or defect; the artist learns to
eliminate these from his creations; he combines in one ideal the
excellences of many deficient forms; “he corrects</p>
<p>In 1782 he suffered a paralytic stroke, from which he partially
recovered. For seven years more he continued to paint. Then his left eye
clouded, and soon lost its vision; in 1789 the right eye began to fail,
and he put down his</p>

<p>brush, despondent that almost total blindness was to be added to the
semi- deafness which since his twenty-seventh year had forced him to use
an ear trumpet. On December io, 1790, he delivered the last of his
discourses. He reaffirmed his faith in the academic and conservative
precepts of his earlier addresses, and renewed his counsel to study line
before color, and the classic painters before attempting innovation. He
ended with a paean to Michelan- gelo:</p>
<p>Were I now to begin the world again, I would tread in the steps of
that great master; to kiss the hem of his garment, to catch the
slightest of his per- fections, would be glory and distinction enough
for an ambitious man…. I reflect, not without vanity, that these
discourses bear testimony of my admira- tion of that truly divine man;
and I should desire that the last word which I should pronounce in this
Academy, and from this place, might be the name of Michael Angelo.

<p>The repentant portraitist died on February 23, 1792, and nine
noblemen were proud to bear his remains to St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>V. THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH</p>
<p>Reynolds was a man of the world, ready to make the obeisances
required for social acceptance; Gainsborough was a passionate
individualist who raged at the sacrifices demanded of his personality
and his art as the price of suc- cess. His parents were Dissenters;
Thomas inherited their independence of spirit without their piety.
Stories are told of his playing truant from school in his native Sudbury
to roam the countryside, sketching trees and sky, and the cattle grazing
in the fields or drinking at a pond. Having by the age of fourteen drawn
all the trees in the neighborhood, he obtained permission from his
father to go to London and study art. There he studied the women of the
town, as we gather from his later advice to a young actor: “Don’t run
about London streets, fancying you are catching strokes of nature, at
the hazard of your constitution. It was my first school, and deeply read
in petti- coats I am; therefore you may allow me to caution you.” 47</p>
<p>Suddenly, still but nineteen, he found himself married to a Scottish
girl of sixteen, Margaret Burr. She was, by most accounts, the
illegitimate daughter of a duke, but she had an income of ^200 a year.
48 In 1748 they settled in Ipswich. He joined a music club there, for he
was fond of music, and played several instruments. “I make portraits for
a living, landscapes because I love them, and music because I cannot hel
p myself.” 49 In the work of the Dutch “landskip” painters he found a
reinforcement of his interest in nature. Philip Thicknesse, governor of
the nearby Landguard Fort, commissioned him to paint the fort, the
neighboring hills, and Harwich; then he advised him to seek a richer and
wider clientele in Bath.</p>
<p>Arrived there (1759), Gainsborough sought out the musicians rather
than the artists, and soon numbered Johann Christian Bach among his
friends. He had the soul and sensitivity of a musician, and in his
paintings he turned</p>
<p>75^ ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXmusic into warmth of color and grace of line. Bath had some good
collec- tions; now he could study landscapes by Claude Lorrain and
Gaspard Pous- sin, and portraits by Vandyck; he became the inheritor of
Vandyck’s Eng - lish manner — portraits that added the highest
refinement of art to distinction of personality and elegance of
dress.</p>
<p>In Bath he did some of his best work. The Sheridans were living
there; Gainsborough painted Richard’s lovely young wife. 50 He lavished
all his maturing artistry on The Honorable Mrs. Graham ? 1 whose red
robe, in its wrinkles and folds, allowed him to display the most
delicate gradations of color and shade. When this portrait was exhibited
in the Royal Academy at London (1777) it seemed to many observers to
outshine anything that Reynolds had done. About 1770 Gainsborough
transfigured Jonathan But- tal, son of an ironmonger, into The Blue Boy,
for which the Huntington Art Gallery paid 00,000. Reynolds had expressed
his conviction that no acceptable portrait could be done in blue; his
rising rival met the challenge triumphantly; blue became henceforth a
favorite color in English painting.</p>
<p>Now every notab le in Bath wished to sit for Gainsborough. But “I’m
sick of portraits,” he told a friend, “and wish very much to take my
viol -da- gamba and walk off to some sweet village, where I can paint
landskips and enjoy the fag end of life in quietness and ease.” 52
Instead he moved to Lon - don (1774) and rented sumptuous rooms in
Schomberg House, Pall Mall, at £ 300 a year; he was not to be outdone by
Reynolds’ display. He quarreled with the Academy on the hanging of his
pictures; for four years (1773-77) he refused to exhibit there; and
after 1783 his new work could be seen only at the annual opening of his
studio. Art critics began an ungracious war of comparisons between
Reynolds and Gainsborough; Reynolds was generally rated superior, but
the royal family favored Gainsborough, and he painted them all. Soon
half of the blue bloods of England flocked to Schomberg House, seeking
the precarious immortality of paint. Now Gainsborough por- trayed
Sheridan, Burke, Johnson, Franklin, Blackstone, Pitt II, Clive… To
establish himself, and pay his rent, he had to resign himself to
portraiture.</p>
<p>His sitters found him hard to please. One lord put on all his airs as
he posed; Gainsborough sent him away unpainted. Garrick’s f eatures were
so mobile and changeful (for this was half the secret of his superiority
as an actor) that the artist could find no expression that lasted long
enough to re- veal the man. He had the same trouble with Garrick’s rival
Samuel Foote. “Rot them for a couple of rogues,” exclaimed Gainsborough;
“they have everybody’s face but their own.” 53 He found a different
difficulty with Mrs. Siddons: “Damn your nose, madam! There’s no end to
it.” 54 He was at his best with women; he felt their sexual attraction
strongly, but he sublimated this into a poetry of soft colors and dreamy
eyes.</p>
<p>When his expensive establishment allowed him he painted landscapes,
for which there was little demand. Often he placed his sitters — or
standees — against a rustic scene, as in Robert Andrews and His Wife
(which brought 64,000 at an auction in i960). Too busy to go and sketch
in the face of living nature, he brought into his studio stumps, weeds,
branches, flowers,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REYNOLDS</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>animals, and arranged them — with dressed-up dolls to serve as people
— into a tableau; 55 from these objects, from his memories, and from his
imagination, he painted landscapes. There was a certain artificial
quality in them, a for- malism and regularity seldom found in nature;
even so the result conveyed an air of rural fragrance and peace. In his
later years he painted some “fancy pictures,” in which he made no
pretense to realism, but indulged his romantic temper; one of these,
Cottage Girl with Dog and Pitcher, has all the senti- ment of Greuze’s
La Cruche cassee ( The Broken Pitcher) -, both were painted in 17 85.
56</p>
<p>Only an artist can measure Gainsborough’s worth. In his own time he
was ranked below Reynolds; his drawing was criticized as careless, his
composi- tion as lacking unity, his figures as improperly posed; but
Reynolds himself praised the shimmering brilliance of his rival’s
coloring. There was a poetry</p>
<p>As he grew older he turned melancholy, for the romantic spirit,
unless it is religious, is helpless in the face of death. In many
Gainsborough land- scapes a dead tree intrudes itself as a memento mori
amid rich foliage and lush grass. Probably he surmised that cancer was
consuming him, and felt a rising bitterness at the thought of so
prolonged an agony. A few days be- fore he died he wrote a letter of
reconciliation to Reynolds and asked the older man to visit him.
Reynolds came, and the two men, who had not so much quarreled as been
the subject of lesser men’s disputes, engaged in a friendly chat. When
they parted Gainsborough remarked, “Goodbye till we meet in the
hereafter, Vandyck in our company.” 57 He died on August 2, 1788, in his
sixty-first year.</p>
<p>Reynolds joined Sheridan in carrying the body to Kew Churchyard. Four
months later Reynolds, in his Fourteenth Discourse, paid him a just
tribute. He frankly noted defects as well as excellences in
Gainsborough’s work, but he added: “If ever this nation should produce
genius sufficient to acquire to us the honorable distinction of an
English School, the name of Gains- borough will be transmitted to
posterity, in the history of art, among the very first of that rising
name.” 58</p>
<p>George Romney struggled to reach the popularity of Reynolds and</p>
<p>Gainsborough, but his defects of education, health, and character
kept him to a more modest role. Without schooling after the age of
twelve, he worked in his father’s carpentry shop in Lancashire till he
was nineteen. His draw -</p>

<p>XXXings won him instruction in painting from a local wastrel. At
twenty-two he fell seriously ill; recovering, he married the nurse; soon
restless, he left her to seek his fortune; he saw her only twice in the
next thirty-seven years, but he sent her a part of his earnings. He made
enough to visit Paris and Rome, where he was influenced by the
neoclassical trend. Back in London, he attracted patronage by his
ability to clothe his sitters in grace or dignity. One of these was Emma
Lyon, the future Lady Hamilton; Romney was so captivated by her beauty
that he portrayed her as goddess, Cassandra, Circe, Magdalen, Joan of
Arc, and saint. In 1782 he painted a portrait of Lady Sutherland, for
which he received ^18; it was recently sold for 50,000. In 1799, broken
in body and mind, he returned to his wife; she nursed him again, as she
had done forty-four years before. He lingered through three years of
paralysis, and died in 1802. Through him and Reynolds and Gains- borough
England was now, in this half century, in painting as well as in
politics and literature, in the full stream of European
civilization.</p>
