<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>The Medieval Jews</p>
<p>565-1300</p>
<p>I. THE ORIENTAL COMMUNITIES</p>
<p>I SRAEL now had a law, but no state; a book, but no home. To 614
Jerusa- lem was a Christian city; till 629, Persian; till 637, again
Christian; then, till 1099, a Moslem provincial capital. In that year
the Crusaders besieged Jerusalem; the Jews joined the Moslems in its
defense; when it fell, the surviv- ing Jews were driven into a
synagogue, and were burned to death. 1 A rapid growth of Palestinian
Jewry followed the recapture of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187; and
Saladin’s brother, the Sultan al -Adil, welcomed the 300 rabbis who in 1
2 1 1 fled from England and France. Fifty-two years later, however,
Nachmanides found there a mere handful of Jews; 2 the Holy City had be-
come overwhelmingly Mohammedan.</p>
<p>Despite conversions and occasional persecutions, Jews remained
numerous in Moslem Syria, Babylonia (Iraq), and Persia, and developed a
vigorous economic and cultural life. In their internal affairs they
continued, as under the Sasanian kings, to enjoy self-government under
their exilarch and the directors of their rabbinical academies. The
exilarch was accepted by the caliphs as the head of all the Jews in
Babylonia, Armenia, Turkestan, Persia, and Yemen; according to Benjamin
of Tudela all subjects of the caliphs were required “to rise in the
presence of the Prince of the Captivity and to salute him respectfully.”
3 The office of exilarch was hereditary in one famly, which traced its
lineage to David; it was a political rather than a spiritual power; and
its efforts to control the rabbinate led to its decline and fall. After
762 the directors of the academies elected and dominated the
exilarch.</p>
<p>The rabbinical colleges at Sura and Pumbeditha provided religious and
intellectual leadership for the Jews of Islam, and in less degree for
those of Christendom. In 658 the Caliph Ali freed the academy of Sura
from the juris- diction of the exilarch; thereupon its head, Mar-Isaac,
took the title Gaon, or Excellency, and inaugurated the Gaonate, the
epoch of the Geonim in Baby- lonian religion and scholarship. 4 As the
college of Pumbeditha rose in reve- nues and dignity from its proximity
to Baghdad, its directors also assumed the title of Gaon. From the
seventh to the eleventh century, questions in Talmudic law were
addressed to these Geonim from all the Jewish world; and their responsa
created a new legal literature for Judaism.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>THE MEDIEVAL JEWS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>The rise of the Geonim coincided with — perhaps in some measure it
was necessitated by — a heresy that now shook and divided Oriental
Jewry. In 762, when the Exilarch Solomon died, his nephew Anan ben David
stood in line for the succession; but the heads of Sura and Pumbeditha,
discarding the hereditary principle, installed as exilarch Anan’s
younger brother Chananya. Anan denounced the two Geonim, fled to
Palestine, established his own syn- agogue, and called upon Jews
everywhere to reject the Talmud and obey only the law of the Pentateuch.
This was a return to the position of the Sad- ducees; it corresponded to
the repudiation of the “traditions,” and exaltation</p>
<p>Saadia ben Joseph al-Fayyumi was born at Dilaz, a village of the
Faiyum, in 892. He grew up in Egypt, and married there. In 915 he
migrated to Pal- estine, then to Babylonia. He must have been an apt
student and sound teacher, for at the youthful age of thirty-six he was
made Gaon or director of the college at Sura. Perceiving the inroads
that Qaraism and skepticism had made upon orthodox Judaism, he set
himself the same task that the mutakal- linrun had undertaken in Islam —
to demonstrate the full accord of the tradi- tional faith with reason
and history. In his brief life of fifty years Saadia produced — mostly
in Arabic — a mass of writings rivaled only by those of</p>
<ul>
<li>From Qera , Aramaic for text ; from qctra, to read; cf. Quran.</li>
</ul>
<p>3&lt;58 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Maimonides in the record of medieval Jewish thought. His Agron, an
Ara- maic dictionary of Hebrew, founded Hebrew philology; his Kitab
al-Lugah , or Book of Language , is the oldest known grammar of the
Hebrew tongue; his Arabic translation of the Old Testament remained to
our time the version used by Arabic-speaking Jews; his several
commentaries on books of the Bible rank him as “perhaps the greatest
Bible commentator of all time”; 8 his Kitab al-Amanat , or Book of
Philosophical Doctrines and Beliefs (933), is the Summa contra Gentiles
of Jewish theology.</p>
<p>Saadia accepts both revelation and tradition, the written and the
oral Law; but he also accepts reason, and proposes to prove by reason
the truth of reve- lation and tradition. Wherever the Bible clearly
contradicts reason, we may assume that the passage is not meant to be
taken literally by adult minds. An- thropomorphic descriptions of the
deity are to be understood metaphori- cally; God is not like a man. The
order and law of the world indicate an intelligent creator. It is
unreasonable to suppose that an intelligent God would fail to reward
virtue, but obviously virtue is not always rewarded in this life;
consequently there must be another life, which will redeem the ap-
parent injustice of this one. Perhaps the sufferings of the virtuous
here are punishments for their occasional sins, so that they may enter
paradise at once when they die; and the earthly triumphs of the wicked
are rewards for their incidental virtues, so that . . . But even those
who achieve the highest virtue, prosperity, and happiness on earth feel
in their hearts that there is a better state than this one of indefinite
possibilities and limited fulfillments; and how could a God intelligent
enough to create so marvelous a world allow such hopes to form in the
soul if they were never to be realized? 9 Saadia took a leaf or two from
Moslem theologians, and followed their methods of exposi- tion, even,
now and then, the details of their argument. In turn his work per-
meated the Jewish world, and influenced Maimonides . “Were it not for
Saadia,” said ben Maimon, “the Torah would almost have disappeared.”
10</p>
<p>It must be admitted that Saadia was a man of some acerbity, and that
his quarrel with the Exilarch David ben Zakkai injured Babylonian Jewry.
In 930 David excommunicated Saadia, and Saadia excommunicated David. In
940 David died, and Saadia appointed a new exilarch; but this appointee
was assassinated by Moslems on the ground that he had disparaged
Mohammed. Saadia appointed the victim’s son to succeed him, wh ereupon
this youth also was slain. The discouraged Jews decided to leave the
office unfilled; and in 942 the Babylonian exilarchate closed its career
of seven centuries. In that year Saadia died. The disintegration of the
Baghdad caliphate, the establish- ment of Egypt, North Africa, and Spain
as independent Moslem states, weakened the bonds between Asiatic,
African, and European Jewry. The Babylonian Jews shared in the economic
decline of Eastern Islam after the tenth century; the college of Sura
closed its doors in 1 034, that of Pumbeditha four years later; and in
1040 the Gaonate came to an end. The Crusades fur-</p>
<p>CHAP.XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 369</p>
<p>ther isolated the Babylonian from the Egyptian and European Jews; and
after the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1 2 5 8 the Babylonian J ewish
community almost disappeared from history.</p>
<p>Long before these catastrophes many Oriental Jews had migrated to
fur- ther Asia, Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, and Europe. Ceylon had
23,000 Hebrews in 1 165; 11 several Jewish communities in Arabia
survived the hos- tility of Mohammed; when Amr conquered Egypt in 641 he
reported “40, - 000 tributary” (taxpaying) Jews in Alexandria. As Cairo
spread its prolif - erations, its Jewish population, orthodox and
Qaraite, increased. The Egyptian Jews enjoyed self-government in
internal affairs under their nagid , or prince; they rose to wealth in
commerce and to a high place in the admin- istration of the Moslem
state. 12 In 960, according to a tradition, four rabbis sailed from Bari
in Italy; their vessel was captured by a Spanish Moslem ad- miral, and
they were sold into slavery: Rabbi Moses and his son Chanoch at Cordova,
Rabbi Shemaria at Alexandria, Rabbi Hushiel at Qairwan. Each rabbi, we
are told, was freed, and founded an academy in the city where he had
been sold. It is usually assumed, but not certain, that they were
scholars from Sura; in any case they brought the learning of Eastern
Jewry to the West, and while Judaism declined in Asia it entered upon
its halcyon days in Egypt and Spain.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES</li>
</ol>
<p>Jews made their way into medieval Russia from Babylonia and Persia
through Transoxiana and the Caucasus, and up the Black Sea coast from
Asia Minor through Constantinople. In that capital, and in the Byzantine
realm, the Jews enjoyed a harassed prosperity from the eighth to the
twelfth cen- tury. Greece had several substantial Jewish communities,
notably at Thebes, where their silk manufactures earned high repute. Up
through Thessaly, Thrace, and Macedonia the Jews migrated into the
Balkans, and followed the Danube into Hungary. A handful of Hebrew
merchants came to Poland from Germany in the tenth century. Jews had
been in Germany since pre- Christian times. In the ninth century there
were considerable Jewish settle- ments at Metz, Speyer, Mainz, Worms,
Strasbourg, Frankfort, and Cologne. These groups were too busy and
mobile with commerce to contribute much to cultural history; however,
Gershom ben Jehuda (960-1028) founded a rabbinical academy at Mainz,
wrote a Hebrew commentary on the Talmud, and acquired such authority
that German Jewry addressed to him, rather than to the Geonim of
Babylonia, their questions on Talmudic law.</p>
<p>There were Jews in England in 691. 13 Many more came in with William
the Conqueror, and were at first protected by the Norman rulers as
providers of capital and collectors of revenue. Their communities in
London, Nor- wich, York, and other English centers were outside the
jurisdiction of the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>local authorities, and were subject only to the king. This legal
isolation wid- ened the barrier between Christian and Jew, and played a
part in the pogroms of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>Gaul had had Jewish merchants from the time of Caesar. By 600 there
were Jewish colonies in all the major cities. The Merovingian kings
perse- cuted them with pious ferocity; Chilperic ordered them all to
accept Christi- anity or have their eyes torn out (581). 14 Charlemagne,
while maintaining discriminatory laws against the Jews, protected them
as useful and enterpris- ing farmers and craftsmen, merchants, doctors,
and financiers, and employed a Jew as his personal physician. In 787,
according to a disputed tradition, he brought the Kalonymos family from
Lucca to Mainz to encourage Jewish scholarship in the Frank realm. In
797 he sent a Jew as interpreter or as drago- man with an embassy to
Harun al-Rashid. Louis the Pious favored the Jews as stimulators of
commerce, and appointed a magister ludaeormn to guard their rights.
Despite hostile legends, legal disabilities, and occasional minor
persecutions, the Jews enjoyed in France in the ninth and tenth
centuries a degree of prosperity and peace hardly known again by the
Jews of Europe before the French Revolution. 15</p>
<p>All through Italy there were little Jewish enclaves, from Trani to
Venice and Milan. Jews were especially numerous in Padua, and may have
influenced the growth of Averroism in the university there. Salerno,
home of the first medieval school of scientific medicine in Latin
Christendom, contained 600 Jews, 16 several of them noted physicians.
The Emperor Frederick II had Jewish scholars at his court in Foggia, and
Pope Alexander III ( 1 1 59-8 1 ) had several Jews in high position in
his household; 17 but Frederick joined with Pope Gregory IX in
oppressive measures against the Jews of Italy.</p>
<p>The Spanish Jews called themselves Sephardim, and traced their origin
to the royal tribe of Judah.* After the conversion of King Recared
(586-601) to orthodox Christianity the Visigothic government united with
the power- ful hierarchy of the Spanish Church to make life less
attractive to the Jews. They were excluded from public office, and were
forbidden to marry Chris- tians or have Christian slaves. King Sisebut
ordered all Jews to accept Chris- tianity or emigrate (61 3) ; his
successor repealed this decree, but the Council of Toledo of 633 ruled
that those Jews who had submitted to baptism and then returned to
Judaism should be separated from their children and sold into slavery.
King Chintila renewed Sisebut’s decree (638); and King Egica prohibited
Jewish ownership of land, and any business transaction between Christian
and Jew (693). When the Moors and Arabs invaded the peninsula (7 1 1 )
the Jews helped them at every turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sepharad is the name applied in the Book of Obadiah (i, 20) to a
region, presumably Asia Minor, to which some Jews were deported by
Nebuchadrezzar (597 b.c.) ; the word was later applied to Spain. The
Jews of Germany were loosely called Ashkenazim through their sup- posed
derivation from Ashkenaz, grandson of Japheth (Gen. x, 3).</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 37 1</p>
<p>The conquerors, to repopulate the land, invited immigration; 50,000
Jews came from Asia and Africa* 18 some towns, like Lucena, were
inhabited almost wholly by Jews. Freed from economic disabilities, the
Jews of Moslem Spain spread into every field of agriculture, industry,
finance, and the professions. They adopted the dress, language, and
customs of the Arabs, garbed them- selves in turbans and silk robes,
rode in carriages, and were hardly distin- guishable from their Semitic
cousins. Several Jews became court physicians, and one of these was made
adviser to the greatest of the caliphs of Cordova. Hasdai ibn Shaprut
(915-70) was to Abd-er-Rahman III what Nizam al- Mulk in the next
century would be to Malik Shah. Bom in the wealthy and cultured Ibn Ezra
family, his father taught him Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin; he studied
medicine and other sciences at Cordova, cured the Caliph’s ail - ments,
and showed such wide knowledge and good judgment in politics that he was
appointed to the diplomatic staff, apparently at the age of twenty-
five. He was entrusted with ever larger responsibilities over the
financial and commercial life of the state. He had no official title;
the Caliph hesitated to arouse resentment by making him officially
vizier; but Hasdai performed his many functions with such tact that he
won the good will of Arabs, Jews, and Christians alike. He encouraged
learning and literature, provided students with scholarships and books,
and gathered about him a salon of poets, savants, and philosophers. When
he died, Moslems vied with Jews in honoring his memory.</p>
<p>There were similar, if lesser, figures, elsewhere in Moslem Spain. At
Seville al-Mutamid invited to his court the scholar and astronomer Isaac
ben Baruch, gave him the title of Prince, and made him head rabbi of all
the Jewish con- gregations there. 19 At Granada Samuel Halevi ibn
Naghdela rivaled the power and wisdom, and exceeded the learning, of
Hasdai ibn Shaprut. Born (993) and reared in Cordova, he combined the
study of the Talmud with that of Arabic literature, and both with the
selling of spices. When Cordova fell to the Berbers he moved to Malaga,
and there added to his modest income by composing letters for
petitioners to King Habbus of Granada. Struck with the calligraphy and
diction of these letters, the King’s vizier v isited Samuel, took him to
Granada, and installed him in the Alhambra as his secretary. Soon Samuel
was also his adviser, and the vizier said that “when Samuel gave coun -
sel the voice of God was heard.” Dying, the vizier recommended Samuel as
his successor; and in 1027 Samuel became the only Jew openly to hold the
office and name of vizier in a Moslem state; this was the more feasible
in Gra- nada, where half the population in the eleventh century was
Jewish. 20 The Arabs soon applauded the choice, for under Samuel the
little state flourished financially, politically, and culturally. Fie
himself was a scholar, poet, as- tronomer, mathematician, and linguist,
knowing seven tongues; he wrote (chiefly in Hebrew) twenty treatises on
grammar, several volumes of poetry and philosophy, an introduction to
the Talmud, and an anthology of Hebrew</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>literature. He shared his fortune with other poets, came to the
rescue of the poet and philosopher Ibn Gabirol, financed young students,
and contributed to Jewish communities in three continents. While vizier
to the King he was also rabbi to the Jews, and lectured on the Talmud.
His grateful people con- ferred upon him the title of Nagid — Prince (in
Israel) . When he died (1055) he was succeeded as vizier and Nagid by
his son Joseph ibn Naghdela.</p>
<p>Those centuries — the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth — were the golden
age of Spanish Jewry, the happiest and most fruitful period in medieval
Hebrew history. When Moses ben Chanoch (d. 965), one of the Bari
emigres, was ransomed in Cordova, he organized there, with Hasdai’s
help, an academy that soon acquired the intellectual leadership of the
Jewish world. Similar schools were opened at Lucena, Toledo, Barcelona,
Granada . . . ; and whereas the schools of Eastern Jewry had almost
confined themselves to re- ligious education, these gave instruction
also in literature, music, mathemat- ics, astronomy, medicine, and
philosophy. 21 Such education gave to the upper half of the Jewish
population in Spain a breadth and depth of culture and refinement at
that time equaled only by their Moslem, Byzantine, and Chinese
contemporaries. It was then a disgrace for a man of wealth or politi-
cal position to be unacquainted with history, science, philosophy, and
poetry. 22 A Jewish aristocracy took form, graced by beautiful women;
per- haps it was too keenly conscious of its superiority, but it
redeemed its pride by its sense that good birth and fortune are an
obligation to generosity and excellence.</p>
<p>The decline of Spanish Jewry might be dated from the fall of Joseph
ibn Naghdela. He served the king almost as ably as his father had done,
but not with the modest tact that had reconciled a population half
Moorish to be ruled by a Jew. He took all power in his hands, dressed as
royally as the king, and laughed at the Koran; gossip called him an
atheist. In 1066 the Arabs and Berbers revolted, crucified Joseph,
massacred 4000 Jews in Granada, and plundered their homes. The remaining
Jews were compelled to sell their lands and emigrate. Twenty years later
the Almoravids came from Africa, aflame with orthodoxy; and the long
honeymoon of Spanish Moslems and Jews was ended. A Mohammedan theologian
announced that the Jews had promised Mohammed to accept Islam at the end
of 500 years after the Hegira, if by that time their expected Messiah
had not come; the five centuries were up in 1107 by Mohammedan
reckoning; the Emir Yusuf demanded the con- version of all the Jews in
Spain, but excused them on payment of an enormous sum into his treasury.
23 When the Almohads replaced the Almoravids as rulers of Morocco and
Moslem Spain (1 148), they gave the Jews and the Christians the same
choice that King Sisebut had allowed the Jews 535 years before —
apostasy or exile. Many Jews pretended conversion to Islam; many
followed the Christians into northern Spain.</p>
<p>There, at first, they found a royal tolerance as magnanimous as that
which</p>
<p>CHAP, XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 373</p>
<p>they had enjoyed for four centuries under Islam. Alfonso VI and VII
of Castile treated the Jews well, made Jew and Christian equal before
the law, and sternly repressed an anti-Semitic outbreak in Toledo
(1107), where there were then 72,000 Jews. 24 A like entente between the
mother and daugh- ter religions prevailed for a century in Aragon;
indeed King James I invited Jews to settle in Majorca, Catalonia, and
Valencia, and in many cases gave Jewish settlers free homes and lands.
25 In Barcelona they dominated com- merce in the twelfth century, and
owned a third of the soil. 26 The Jews of Christian Spain were severely
taxed, but they prospered, and enjoyed inter- nal autonomy. Trade flowed
freely between Christian, Jew, and Moor; the three exchanged gifts on
holidays; now and then a king contributed to a synagogue building fund.
27 From 1085 even to 1492, Jews could be found in high public office in
Spanish Christian states as fiscal agents and diplomats, sometimes as
ministers. 28 During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the Christian
clergy joined in this Christian amity. 29</p>
<p>The first outbreak of intolerance was among the Jews themselves. In
1149 Jehuda ibn Ezra, steward of the palace to Alfonso VII of Leon and
Castile, turned the powers of his mast er’s government against the
Qaraite Jews of Toledo; the details are unknown, but from that time the
once numerous Spanish Qaraites are heard of no more. 30 In 1212 some
Christian crusaders entered Spain to help free it from the Moors; for
the most part they treated the Jews well; one group attacked the Jews of
Toledo and killed many of them; but the Christians of the city rose to
the defense of their fellow citizens, and stopped the persecution. 31
Alfonso X of Castile included anti-Judaic leg- islation in his law code
of 1 265, but the code was not put into effect till 1 348; meanwhile
Alfonso employed a Jewish physician and treasurer, presented to the Jews
of Seville ’three mosques to be turned into synagogues, 32 and basked in
the splendor that Jewish and Moslem scholarship shed upon his genial
reign. In 1 276 the military enterprises of Pedro III of Aragon required
insuf- ferable taxes; his finance minister and several other officials
were Jews; a re- volt of nobles and cities against the monarchy
compelled the King to dismiss his Jewish aides, and to confirm a
resolution of the Cortes (1283) against further employment of Jews in
the government. The era of toleration ended when the ecclesiastical
Council of Zamora (1313) decreed the imposition of the badge, the
segregation of the Jewish from the Christian population, and a ban
against the employment of Jewish physicians by Christians, or of Chris-
tian servants by Jews. 33</p>

<p>Excepting Palermo and a few towns in Spain, the cities of medieval
Chris- tendom required no segregation of their Jewish population.
Usually, how- ever, the Jews lived in a voluntary isolation for social
convenience, physical security, and religious unity. The synagogue was
the geographical, social, and economic center of the Jewish quarter, and
drew most Jewish dwellings toward it. There was in consequence much
overcrowding, to the detriment of public and private sanitation. In
Spain the Hebrew sections contained handsome residences as well as
hovels and tenements; in the rest of Europe they verged on slums. 34</p>
<p>Allowing for the universally greater influence of the rich in
elections and appointments, the Jewish communities were semidemocratic
enclaves in a monarchical world. The taxpaying members of a congregation
chose the rabbis and officers of the synagogue. A small group of elected
elders sat as a Beth Din or communal court; this levied taxes, fixed
prices, administered justice, issued ordinances — not always observed —
on Jewish diet, dancing, morals, and dress. It was empowered to try
Jewish offenders against Jewish law, and had executive officers to carry
out its decrees. Penalties ranged from fines to excommunication or
banishment. Capital punishment was rarely within the power or custom of
the Beth Din-, in its stead the Jewish court used the herem or full
excommunication — a majestic and frightening cere- mony of charges,
curses, and candles extinguished one by one as a symbol of the culprit’s
spiritual death. The Jews, like the Christians, used excommuni - cation
too frequently, so that in both faiths it lost its terror and
effectiveness. The rabbis, like the Church, prosecuted heretics,
outlawed them, and on rare occasions burned their books. 35</p>
<p>Normally the Jewish community was not subject to local authority. Its
only master was the king; him it paid liberally for a charter protecting
its re- ligious and economic rights; later it paid the liberated
communes to confirm its autonomy. The Jews, however, were subject to the
law of the state, and made it a principle to obey it; “the law of the
kingdom is law,” said the Tal - mud. 36 “Pray for the welfare of the
government,” said another passage, “since but for fear thereof men would
swallow one another alive.” 37</p>
<p>The state laid upon the Jews a poll or head tax, property taxes
running up to 33per, and taxes on meat, wine, jewelry, imports, and
exports; in addition it required “voluntary” contribution s from them to
help finance a war, a coronation, or a royal “progress” or tour. The
English Jews, numbering in the twelfth century one quarter of one per
cent of the population, paid eight per cent of the national taxes. They
raised a fourth of the levy for the crusade</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 375</p>
<p>of Richard I, and donated 5000 marks toward his ransom from German
cap- tivity — thrice the amount given by the city of London. 38 The Jew
was also taxed by his own community, and was periodically dunned for
charity, edu- cation, and the support of the harassed Jews in Palestine.
At any moment, for cause or without, the king might confiscate part or
all of the property of “his Jews,” for in feudal law they were all his
“men.” When a king died, his agree- ment to protect the Jews expired;
his successor could be induced to renew it only by a large gift;
sometimes this was a third of all Jewish property in the state. 39 In
1463 Albrecht III, Margrave of Brandenburg, declared that every new
German k ing “may, according to old usage , either burn all the Jews, or
show them his mercy, and, to save their lives, take the third penny”
(i.e., one third) “of their property.” 40 Bracton, the leading English
jurist of the thir - teenth century, summed up the matter simply: “A Jew
cannot have anything of his own, because whatever he acquires he
acquires not for himself but for the king.” 41</p>
<p>2 . Economy</p>
<p>To these political inconveniences were added economic restrictions.
The Jews were not legally or generally prevented from owning land; at
one time or another in the Middle Ages they owned considerable tracts in
Moslem or Christian Spain, in Sicily, Silesia, Poland, England, and
France. 42 But circum- stances made such ownership increasingly
impractical. Forbidden by Chris- tian law to hire Christian slaves, and
by Jewish law to hire Jewish slaves, the Jew had to work his holding
with free labor, hard to get and costly to retain. Jewish law forbade
the Jew to work on Saturday, Christian law usually for- bade him to work
on Sunday; such leisure was a hardship. Feudal custom or law made it
impossible for a Jew to find a place within the feudal system; any such
position required a Christian oath of fealty, and military service; but
the laws of nearly all Christian states forbade the Jews to carry arms.
43 In Visi- gothic Spain King Sisebut revoked all grants of land made to
Jews by his predecessors; King Egica “nationalized” all Jewish holdings
that had at any time belonged to Christians; and in 1 293 the Cortes of
Valladolid prohibited the sale of land to Jews. The ever-present
possibility of expulsion or attack persuaded the Jews, after the ninth
century, to avoid landed property or rural solitude. All these
conditions discouraged Jewish agriculture, and in- clined the Jew to
urban life, to industry, trade, and finance.</p>
<p>In the Near East and in southern Europe the Jews were active in
industry; indeed in several cases it was they who brought advanced
handicraft tech- niques from Islam or Byzantium to Western lands.
Benjamin of Tudela found hundreds of Jewish glassworkers at Antioch and
Tyre; Jews in Egypt and Greece were renowned for the excellence of their
dyed and embroidered textiles; and as late as the thirteenth century
Frederick II called in Jewish</p>

<p>376</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>craftsmen to manage the state’s silk industry in Sicily. There and
elsewhere</p>
<p>So restricted, the Jews took to trade. Rab, the Babylonian Talmudist,
had given his people a shrewd motto: “Trade with a hundred florins, and
you will afford meat and wine; put the same sum into agriculture, and at
most you may have bread and salt.” 46 The Jewish pedlar was known in
every city and town; the Jewish merchant at every market and fair.
International com- merce was their specialty, almost their monopoly,
before the eleventh cen- tury; their packs, caravans, and ships crossed
deserts, mountains, and seas; and in most instances they accompanied
their goods. They served as com- mercial links between Christendom and
Islam, between Europe and Asia, between the Slavic and the Western
states. They handled most of the trade in slaves. 47 They were helped by
their skill and patience in learning lan- guages; by the understanding
of Hebrew, and the similarity of laws and cus- toms, among widely
separated Jewish communities; and by the hospitality of the Jewish
quarter in every city to any foreign Jew; so Benjamin of Tudela traveled
halfway across the world, and found himself everywhere at home. Ibn
Khordadbeh, director of the post for the Baghdad caliphate in 870, told
in his Book of Routes of Jewish merchants who spoke Persian, Greek,
Arabic, Frank, Spanish, and Slavonic; and he described the land and sea
routes by which they traveled from Spain and Italy to Egypt, India, and
China. 48 These merchants took eunuchs, slaves, brocades, furs, and
swords to the Far East, and brought back musk, aloes, camphor, spices,
and silks. 49 The capture of Jerusalem by the Crusades, and the conquest
of the Mediter- ranean by the fleets of Venice and Genoa, gave the
Italian merchants an ad- vantage over the Jews; and Jewish commercial
leadership ended with the eleventh century. Even before the Crusades
Venice had forbidden the trans- port of Jewish merchants on Venetian
ships, and soon afterward the Hanse- atic League closed its ports on the
North Sea and the Baltic to Jewish trade. 50 By the twelfth century
Jewish commerce was mostly domestic; and even within that narrow scope
it was limited by laws prohibiting the sale of divers goods by Jews.
61</p>
<p>They turned to finance. In a hostile environment where popular
violence might destroy, or royal cupidity confiscate, their immovable
goods, the Jews were forced to the conclusion that their savings should
be in liquid and mo-</p>

<p>bile form. They took first to the simple business of money-changing,
then to receiving money for commercial investment, then to lending money
at in- terest. The Pentateuch 52 and the Talmud 53 had forbidden this
among Jews, but not between Jew and non-Jew. As economic life grew more
complex, and the need for financing became more acute with the expansion
of com- merce and industry, the Jews lent one another money through a
Christian intermediary, 54 or through silent partnerships in an
enterprise and its profits — a device allowed by the rabbis and several
Christian theologians. 55 Since both the Koran and the Church forbade
the charging of interest, and Chris- tian moneylenders were consequently
scarce before the thirteenth century, Moslem and Christian borrowers —
including ecclesiastics, churches, and monasteries 50 — applied to Jews
for loans; so Aaron of Lincoln financed the building of nine Cistercian
monasteries and the great abbey of St. Albans. 57 In the thirteenth
century Christian bankers invaded the field, adopted the methods that
had been developed by the Jews, and soon surpassed them in wealth and
range. “The Christi an usurer, although he did not have to safe- guard
himself to anything like the same extent against the chances of murder
and pillage, was no less exacting” than the Jew. 58 Both alike pressed
the debtor with Roman severity, and the kings exploited them all.</p>
<p>All moneylenders were subject to high taxation, and, in the case of
the Jews, to occasional outright confiscation. The kings made it a
principle to allow high interest rates, and periodically to squeeze the
profits out of the financiers. The cost of collection was high, and in
many cases the creditor had to bribe officials to allow him to capture
his due. 59 In 1198 Innocent III commanded all Christian princes, in
preparation for the Fourth Crusade, to compel full remission of interest
demanded of Christians by Jews. 60 Louis IX, the saintly king of France,
“for the salvation of his own soul and those of his ancestors,” freed
all his subjects from a third of whatever they owed to Jews. 61 English
kings on occasion granted letters of release — canceling interest or
principle or both — to subjects owing money to Jews; not rarely the
kings sold such letters, and noted in their registers the sums they
received for their vi- carious philanthropy. 62 The British government
required a copy of every loan agreement; an Exchequer of the Jews was
formed to file and supervise these agreements, and to hear cases
concerning them; when a Jewish banker could not meet the taxes or levies
laid upon him, the government, checking its record of his loans,
confiscated all or part of them, and notified the debtors to pay not the
lender but the government. 63 When, in 1187, Henry II levied a special
tax upon the people of England, the Jews were compelled to pay one
fourth, the Christians one tenth, of their property; nearly half the
entire tax was paid by the Jews. 04 At times “the Jews financed the
kingdom.” 65 In 1210 King John ordered all Jews in England — men, women,
and children — to be imprisoned; a “tallage” of 66,000 marks was taken
from them; 66 those sus-</p>

<p>pected of concealing the full amount of their hoards were tortured by
having a tooth pulled out each day till they confessed. 67 # In 1 230
Henry III, charg- ing that the Jews had clipped the coin of the realm
(apparently some had), confiscated a third of all the movable property
of the English Jews. The op- eration having proved profitable, it was
repeated in 1239; two years later 20,000 silver marks were exacted from
the Jews; 60,000 marks — a sum equal to the whole yearly revenue of the
Crown — were exacted in 1244. When Henry III borrowed 5000 marks from
the Earl of Cornwall, he consigned to him all the Jews of England as
security. 68 A series of imposts from 1252 to 1 255 drove the Jews to
such desperation that they begged permission to leave England en masse ;
permission was refused. 69 In 1275 Edward I strictly pro- hibited
lending at interest. Loans continued nevertheless; and as the risk was
greater, interest rates rose. Edward ordered all Jews in England
arrested and their goods seized. Many Christian lenders were also
arrested, and three of them were hanged. Of the Jews 280 were hanged,
drawn, and quartered in London; there were additional executions in the
counties; and the property of hundreds of Jews was confiscated to the
state. 70</p>
<p>In the uneasy intervals between confiscations the Jewish bankers
pros- pered, and some became too visibly rich. They not only advanced
capital to build castles, cathedrals, and monasteries, but they raised
for themselves sub- stantial houses; in England their homes were among
the first dwellings built of stone. There were rich and poor among the
Jews, despite Rabbi Eleazar’s dictum that “all men are equal before God—
women and slaves, rich and poor .” 71 The rabbis sought to mitigate
poverty, and check profiteering wealth, by a variety of economic
regulations. They emphasized the responsi- bility of the group for the
welfare of all, and softened the stings of adversity with organized
charity. They did not denounce riches, but they succeeded in giving to
learning a prestige equal to that of wealth. They branded monop- oly and
“corners” as sins; 72 they forbade the retailer to profit by more than a
sixth of the wholesale price; 73 they watched over weights and measures;
they fixed maximum prices and minimum wages. 74 Many of these
regulations failed; the rabbis could not isolate the economic life of
the Jews from that of their neighbors in Islam or Christendom; and the
law of supply and demand of goods and services found a way around all
legislation.</p>

<p>ing in a Jewish community . 75 Periodically, and as early as the
second cen- tury after Christ, each member of the congregation, however
poor, was as- sessed by official overseers for a contribution to the
kupah or “community chest,” which took care of the old, poor, or sick,
and the education and mar- riage of orphans . 76 Hospitality was
accorded freely, especially to wandering scholars; in some communities
incoming travelers were billeted in private homes by officers of the
congregation. Jewish philanthropic societies grew to a great number as
the Middle Ages advanced; not only were there many hospitals,
orphanages, poorhouses, and homes for the aged, but there were or-
ganizations providing ransoms for prisoners, dowries for poor brides,
visits to the sick, care for destitute widows, and free burial for the
dead . 77 Christians complained of Jewish greed, and tried to stir
Christians to charity by citing the exemplary generosity of the Jews .
78</p>
<p>Class differences disported themselves in dress, diet, speech, and a
hundred other ways. The simple Jew wore a long-sleeved and girdled robe
or caftan, usually black as if in mourning for his ruined Temple and
ravished land; but in Spain the well-to-do Jews proclaimed their
prosperity with silks and furs; and the rabbis deplored in vain the
handle given to hostility and discontent by such displays. When the king
of Castile banned finery in raiment the Jew- ish males obeyed, but
continued to array their wives in splendor; when the king demanded an
explanation they assured him that the royal gallantry could never have
meant the restrictions to apply to women ; 79 and the Jews continued
throughout the Middle Ages to robe their ladies well. But they forbade
them to appear in public with uncovered hair; such an offense was ground
for divorce; and the Jew was instructed not to pray in the presence of a
woman whose hair was visible . 80</p>
<p>The hygienic features of the Law alleviated the effects of congested
settle- ments. Circumcision, the weekly bath, the prohibition of wine or
putrid meat as food, gave the Jews superior protection against diseases
rampant in their Christian vicinities . 81 Leprosy was frequent among
the Christian poor, who ate salted meat or fish, but was rare among the
Jews. Perhaps for like reasons the Jews suffered less than Christians
from cholera and kindred ail- ments . 82 But in the slums of Rome,
infested with mosquitoes from the Cam- pagna marshes, Jew and Christian
alike shivered with malaria.</p>
<p>The moral life of the medieval Jew reflected his Oriental heritage
and his European disabilities. Discriminated against at every turn,
pillaged and massacred, humiliated and condemned for crimes not his own,
the Jew, like the physically weak everywhere, resorted to cunning in
self-defense. The rabbis repeated again an d again that “to cheat a
Gentile is even worse than to cheat a Jew,” 83 but some Jews took the
chance ; 84 and perhaps Christians too bargained as shrewdly as they
knew. Some bankers, Jewish or Christian, were ruthless in their resolve
to be paid; though doubtless there were in the Middle Ages, as in the
eighteenth century, moneylenders as honest and faith-</p>

<p>ful as Meyer Anselm of the rote Schild. Certain Jews and Christians
clipped coins or received stolen goods . 86 The frequent use of Jews in
high financial office suggests that their Christian employers had
confidence in their integ- rity. Of violent crimes — murder, robbery,
rape — the Jews were seldom guilty. Drunkenness was rarer among them in
Christian than in Moslem lands.</p>
<p>Their sex life, despite a background of polygamy, was remarkably
whole- some. They were less given to pederasty than other peoples of
Eastern origin. Their women were modest maidens, industrious wives,
prolific and conscien- tious mothers; and early marriage reduced
prostitution to a human mini- mum . 88 Bachelors were rarities. Rabbi
Asher ben Yehiel ruled that a bach- elor of twenty, unless absorbed in
study of the Law, might be compelled to marry by the court . 87
Marriages were arranged by the parents; few girls, says a Jewish
document of the eleventh century, were “indelicate or impudent enough to
express their own fancies of preference”; 88 but no marriage was fully
legal without the consent of both parties . 89 The father might give his
daughter in marriage in her early years, even at six; but such child
marriages were not consummated till maturity, and when the daughter came
of age she could annul it if she wished . 90 The betrothal was a formal
act, making the girl legally the man’s wife; they could not thereafter
separate except by a bill of divorce. At the betrothal a contract
(ketuba) was signed for the dowry and the marriage settlement. The
latter was a sum set aside out of the husband’s estate to be paid his
wife in case the husband should divorce her or die. With- out a marriage
settlement of at least 200 zuzas (which could buy a one-family house),
no marriage with a virgin bride was valid.</p>
<p>Polygamy was practiced by rich Jews in Islamic lands, but was rare
among the Jews of Christendom . 91 Post-Talmudic rabbinical literature
refers a thou- sand times to a man’s “wife,” never to his “wives.” About
the year 1000 Rabbi Gershom ben Judah of Mainz decreed the
excommunication of any polygamous Jew; and soon thereafter, in all
Europe except Spain, polygamy and concubinage became almost extinct
among the Jews. Cases continued to occur, however, where a wife barren
for ten years after marriage allowed her husband to take a concubine or
an additional wife ; 92 parentage was vital. The same decree of Gershom
abolished the old right of the husband to di- vorce his wife without her
consent or guilt. Divorces were probably less frequent in-medieval Jewry
than in modern America.</p>
<p>Despite the comparative looseness of the marriage bond in law, the
family was the saving center of Jewish life. External danger brought
internal unity; and hostile witnesses testify to the “warmth and dignity
. . . thoughtfulness, consideration, parental and fraternal affection,”
that marked and mark the Jewish family . 94 The young husband, merged
with his wife in work, joy, and tribulation, developed a profound
attachment for her as part of his larger self; he became a father, and
the children growing up around him stimulated his reserve energies and
engaged his deepest loyalties. He had probably</p>
<p>CHAP.XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 38 1</p>
<p>known no woman carnally before marriage, and had, in so small and
intimate a community, few chances for infidelity afterward. Almost from
their birth he saved to provide a dowry for his daughters and a marriage
settlement for his sons; and he took it for granted that he should
support them in the early years of their married life; this seemed wiser
than to let youth prepare with a decade of promiscuity for the
restrictions of monogamy. In many cases the bridegroom came to live with
the bride in her father’s home— seldom to the increment of happiness.
The authority of the oldest father in the home was almost as absolute as
in republican Rome. He could excommunicate his children, and might beat
his wife within reason; if he seriously injured her the community fined
him to the limit of his resources. Usually his authority was exercised
with a sternness that never quite concealed a passionate love.</p>
<p>The position of woman was legally low, morally high. Like Plato, the
Jew thanked God that he had not been born a woman; and the woman replied
humbly, “I thank God that I was made according to His will.” 95 In the
synagogue the women occupied a separate place in the gallery or behind
the men — a clumsy compliment to their distracting charms; and they
could not be counted toward making a quorum. Songs in praise of a
woman’s beauty were considered indecorous, though the Talmud allowed
them. 96 Flirtation, if any, was by correspondence; public conversation
between the sexes — even between man and wife — was forbidden by the
rabbis. 97 Dancing was per- mitted, but only of woman with woman, of man
with man. 98 While the hus- band was by law the sole heir of his wife,
the widow did not inherit from her husband; when he died she received
the equivalent of her dowry and the marriage settlement; for the rest
her sons, the natural heirs, were relied upon to support her decently.
Daughters inherited only in the absence of sons; otherwise they had to
depend upon brotherly affection, which seldom failed. 99 Girls were not
sent to school; in their case a little knowledge was accounted an
especially dangerous thing. However, they were allowed to study
privately; we hear of several women who gave public lectures on the Law
— though sometimes the lecturer screened herself from her audience. 100
Despite every physical and legal disadvantage, the deserving Jewish
woman received after marriage full honor and devotion. Judah ben Moses
ibn Tib- bon (1170) quoted approvingly a Moslem sage: “None but the
honorable honor women, none but the despicable despise them.” 101</p>
<p>The parental relation was more nearly perfect than the marital. The
Jew, with the vanity of the commonplace, prided himself on his
reproductive ability and his children; his most solemn oath was taken by
laying his hand upon the testes of the man receiving the pledge; hence
the word testimony. Every man was commanded to have at least two
children; usually there were more. The child was reverenced as a visitor
from heaven, a very angel be- come flesh. The father was reverenced
almost as a vicar of God; the son stood in his father’s presence until
bidden to be seated, and gave him a solicit ous</p>
<p>382 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>obedience that fully comported with the pride of youth. In the
ceremony of circumcision the boy was dedicated to Yahveh by the covenant
of Abra- ham; and every family felt obligated to train one son for the
rabbinate. When the boy had completed his thirteenth year he was
received into manhood, and into all the obligations of the Law, by a
solemn ceremony of confirma- tion.* Religion cast its awe and sanctity
over every stage of development, and eased the tasks of parentage.</p>
<p>4 . Religion</p>
<p>In like manner religion stood as a spiritual policeman over every
phase of the moral code. Doubtless loopholes were found in the Law, and
legal fic- tions were concocted to restore the freedom of adaptation
indispensable to an enterprising people. But apparently the medieval Jew
accepted the Law, by and large, as a bulwark saving him not only from
eternal damnation but, more visibly, from group disintegration. It
harassed him at every turn, but he honored it as the very home and
school of his growth, the vital medium of his life.</p>
<p>Every home in Judaism was a church, every school was a temple, every
father was a priest. The prayers and ritual of the synagogue had their
briefer counterparts in the home. The fasts and festivals of the faith
were celebrated there with educative ceremonies that bound the present
with the past, the living with the dead and the yet unborn. Every Friday
eve of the Sabbath the father called his wife, children, and servants
around him, blessed them individually, and led them in prayer, religious
readings, and sacred songs. To the doorpost of each major room was
attached a tube (mezuzah) contain- ing a parchment roll inscribed with
two passages from Deuteronomy (vi, 4-9; xi, 13-21), reminding the Jew
that his God is one, and must be loved “with all thy heart and soul and
strength.” From the age of four the child was brought to the synagogue;
and there religion was impressed upon him in his most formative
years.</p>
<p>The synagogue was not merely a temple, it was the social center of
the Jewish community; synagoge, like ecclesia, synod , and college,
meant an assemblage, a con-greg-ation. In pre-Christian days it had been
essentially a school; it is still called Schule by Ashkenazic Jews. In
the Dispersion it took on a strange variety of functions. In some
synagogues it was the custom to publish, on the Sabbath, the decisions
reached by the Beth Din during the week; to collect taxes, advertise
lost articles, accept complaints of one mem- ber against another, and
announce the coming sale of property so that any claimant on it might
protest the sale. The synagogue dispensed communal</p>

<p>charity, and, in Asia, served as a lodging for travelers. The
building itself was always the finest in the Jewish quarter; sometimes,
especially in Spain and Italy, it was an architectural masterpiece,
expensively and lovingly adorned. Christian authorities repeatedly
forbade the erection of synagogues equaling in height the tallest
Christian church in the city; in 1221 Pope Honorius III ordered the
destruction of such a synagogue in Bourges. 103 Seville had twenty-three
synagogues in the fourteenth century, Toledo and Cordova almost as many;
one built in Cordova in 1 3 1 5 is now maintained as a national monument
by the Spanish government.</p>
<p>Every synagogue had a school ( Beth ha-midrash — House of Study — the
Arabic madrasa) ; in addition there were private schools and personal
tutors; probably there was a higher relative literacy among the medieval
Jews than among the Christians, 104 though lower than among the Moslems.
Teachers were paid by the community or the parents, but all were under
communal supervision. Boys went off to school at an early hour — in
winter before dawn; some hours later they returned home for breakfast;
then they went back to school till eleven, then home for lunch, back to
school at noon, a respite be- tween two and three, then more schooling
till evening; then at last they were released to their homes for supper,
prayers, and bed. Life was a serious mat- ter for the Jewish boy.
103</p>
<p>Hebrew and the Pentateuch were the primary studies. At the age of ten
the student took up the Mishna, at thirteen the major tractates of the
Tal- mud; those who were to be scholars continued the study of Mishna
and Gemara from thirteen to twenty or later. Through the diversity of
subjects in the Talmud the student received a smattering of a dozen
sciences, but al- most nothing of non-Jewish history. 106 There was much
learning by repeti- tion; the chorus of recitation was so vigorous that
some localities excluded schools. 107 Higher education was given in the
Yeshibah or academy. The graduate of such an academy was called tahnid
hakam — scholar of the Law; he was usually freed from community taxes;
and though he was not neces- sarily a rabbi, all nonscholars were
expected to rise on his coming or going. 108</p>
<p>The rabbi was teacher, jurist, and priest. He was required to marry.
He was paid little or nothing for his religious functions; usually he
earned a liv- ing in the secular world. He seldom &gt; preached; this
was left to itinerant preachers ( maggidim ) schooled in sonorous and
frightening eloquence. Any member of the congregation might lead it in
prayer, read the Scriptures, or preach; usually, however, this honor was
granted to some prominent or philanthropic Jew. Prayer was a complex
ceremony for the orthodox He- brew. To be properly performed it required
that he should cover his head as a sign of reverence, strap upon his
arms and his forehead small cases con- taining passages from Exodus
(xiii, 1-16) and Deuteronomy (vi, 4-9; xi, 13-21), and wear on the
borders of his garments fringes inscribed with the basic commandments of
the Lord. The rabbis explained these formalities as</p>

<p>necessary reminders of the unity, presence, and laws of God; simple
Jews came to look upon them as magical amulets possessed of miraculous
powers. The culmination of the religious service was a reading from the
scroll of the Law, contained in a little ark above the altar.</p>
<p>The Jews of the Dispersion at first frowned upon music in religion as
hardly suited to a mood of grief for their lost home. But music and
religion are as intimately related as poetry and love; the deepest
emotions require for their civilized expression the most emotional of
the arts. Music returned to the synagogue through poetry. In the sixth
century the paitanim or “Neo - Hebraic” poets began to write religious
verse, confused with acrostic and alliterative artificialities, but
uplifted with the resounding splendor of He- brew, and filled with that
religious ardor which in the Jew now served for both patriotism and
piety. The crude but powerful hymns of Eleazar ben Kafir (eighth
century) still find a place in some synagogue rituals. Similar poetry
appeared among the Jews of Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. One such
hymn is sung by many Jews on the Day of Atonement:</p>
<p>With the coming of Thy Kingdom</p>
<p>The hills shall break into song,</p>
<p>And the islands laugh exultant</p>
<p>That they to God belong.</p>
<p>And all their congregations</p>
<p>So loud Thy praise shall sing</p>
<p>That the farthest peoples, hearing,</p>
<p>Shall hail Thee crowned King. 109</p>
<p>When such piutim or sacred poems were introduced into the synagogue
service they were sung by a precentor, and music re-entered the ritual.
Fur- thermore the scriptural readings and the prayers were in many
synagogues chanted by a cantor or by the congregation in a
“cantillation” whose mu - sical tones were largely improvised, but
occasionally followed patterns set in the plain song of the Christian
chant. 110 From the singing school of the monastery of St. Gall in
Switzerland, at some time before the eleventh cen- tury, came the
complex chant for the famous Hebrew song Kol Nidre — “All Vows.” 111</p>
<p>The synagogue never fully replaced the Temple in the heart of the
Jew. The hope that he might some day offer sacrifice to Yahveh before
the Holy of Holies on Zion’s hill inflamed his imagination, and left him
open to re - peated deception by false messiahs. About 720 Serene, a
Syrian, announced himself to be the expected redeemer, and organized a
campaign to recapture Palestine from the Moslems. Jews from Babylonia
and Spain abandoned their homes to join his adventure. He was taken
prisoner, exposed as a char- latan by the Caliph Yezid II, and was put
to death. Some thirty years later Obadiah Abu Isa ben Ishaq of Isfahan
led a similar revolt; 10,000 Jews took up the sword and fought bravely
under his lead; they were defeated, Abu</p>
<p>CHAP.XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 385</p>
<p>Isa was slain in battle, and the Isfahan Jews suffered indiscriminate
punish- ment. When the First Crusade excited Europe, Jewish communities
dreamed that the Christians, if victorious, would restore Palestine to
the Jews; 112 they awoke from this fantasy to a succession of pogroms.
In 1160 David Alrui aroused the Jews of Mesopotamia with the
announcement that he was the Messiah, and would restore them to
Jerusalem and liberty; his father-in-law, fearing disaster for the Jews
from such an insurrection, slew him in his sleep. About 1225 another
Messiah appeared in southern Arabia, and stirred the Jews to mass
hysteria; Maimonides, in a famous “Letter to the South,” ex - posed the
impostor’s claims, and reminded the Arabian Jews of the death</p>

<li>ANTI-SEMITISM*. 500-1306</li>
</ol>
<p>What were the sources of the hostility between non-Jew and Jew?</p>
<p>The main sources have ever been economic, but religious differences
have given edge and cover to economic rivalries. The Moslems, living by
Mo- hammed, resented the Jewish rejection of their prophet; the
Christians, ac- cepting the divinity of Christ, were shocked to find
that His own people would not acknowledge that divinity. Good Christians
saw nothing un- christian or inhuman in holding an entire people,
through many centuries, responsible for the actions of a tiny minority
of Jerusalem Jews in the last days of Christ. The Gospel of Luke told
how “throngs” of Jews welcomed</p>
<p>Around that central misunderstanding rose a thousand suspicions and
ani- mosities. Jewish bankers bore the brunt of the hostility aroused by
interest rates that reflected the insecurity of loans. As the economy of
Christendom developed, and Christian merchants and bankers invaded
fields once domi- nated by Jews, economic competition fomented hate; and
some Christian moneylenders actively promoted anti-Semitism. 115 Jews in
official positions, especially in the finance department of governments,
were a natural target</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>for those who disliked both taxes and Jews. Given such economic and
reli- gious enmity, everything Jewish became distasteful to some
Christians, and everything Christian to some Jews. The Christian
reproached the Jew for clannish exclusiveness, and did not excuse it as
a reaction to discrimination and occasional physical assault. Jewish
features, language, manners, diet, ritual all seemed to the Christian
eye offensively bizarre. The Jews ate when Christians fasted, fasted
when Christians ate; their Sabbath of rest and prayer had remained
Saturday as of old, while that of the Christians had been changed to
Sunday; the Jews celebrated their happy deliverance from Egypt in a
Passover feast that came too close to the Friday on which Christians
mourned the death of Christ. Jews were not allowed by their Law to eat
food cooked, to drink wine pressed, or to use dishes or utensils that
had been touched, by a non-Jew , 118 or to marry any but a Jew ; 117 the
Christian interpreted these ancient laws — formulated long before
Christianity — as meaning that to a Jew everything Christian was
unclean; and he retorted that the Israelite himself was not usually
distinguished by cleanliness of person or neatness of dress. Mutual
isolation begot absurd and tragic legends on both sides. Romans had
accused Christians of murdering pagan children to offer their blood in
secret sacrifice to the Christian God; Christians of the twelfth century
accused Jews of kidnaping Christian children to sacrifice them to
Yahveh, or to use their blood as medicine or in the making of un-
leavened bread for the Passover feast. Jews were charged with poisoning
the wells from which Christians drank, and with stealing consecrated
wafers to pierce them and draw from them the blood of Christ . 118 When
a few Jewish merchants flaunted their opulence in costly raiment the
Jews as a people were accused of draining the wealth of Christendom into
Jewish hands. Jew- ish women were suspected as sorceresses; many Jews,
it was thought, were in league with the Devil . 119 The Jews retaliated
with like legends about Christians, and insulting stories about the
birth and youth of Christ. The Talmud counseled the extension of Jewish
charity to non- Jews ; 120 Bahya praised Christian monasticism;
Maimonides wrote that “the teachings of Christ and Mohammed tend to lead
mankind to ward perfection”; 121 but the average Jew could not
understand these courtesies of philosophy, and re- turned all the hatred
that he received.</p>
<p>There were some lucid intervals in this madness. Ignoring state
and</p>
<p>Church laws that forbade it, Christians and Jews often mingled in
friendship, sometimes in marriage, above all in Spain and southern
France. Christian and Jewish scholars collaborated — Michael Scot with
Anatoli, Dante with Im- manuel . 122 Christians made gifts to
synagogues; and in Worms a Jewish park was maintained through a legacy
from a Christian woman . 123 In Lyons the market day was changed from
Saturday to Sunday for the convenience of the Jews. Secular governments,
finding the Jews an asset in commerce and</p>
<p>CHAP.XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 387</p>
<p>finance, gave them a vacillating protection; and in several cases
where a state restricted the public movements of Jews, or expelled them
from its territory, it was because it could no longer safeguard them
from intolerance and vio- lence. 124</p>
<p>The attitude of the Church in these matters varied with place and
time. In Italy she protected the Jews as “guardians of the Law” of the
Old Testament, and as living witnesses to the historicity of the
Scriptures and to “the wrath of God.” But pe riodically Church councils,
often with excellent intentions, and seldom with general authority,
added to the tribulations of Jewish life. The Theodosian Code (439), the
Council of Clermont (535), and the Coun- cil of Toledo (589) forbade the
appointment of Jews to positions in which they could impose penalties
upon Christians. The Council of Orleans (538) ordered Jews to stay
indoors in Holy Week, probably for their protection, and prohibited
their employment in any public office. The Third Council of the Lateran
( 1 1 79) forbade Christian midwives or nurses to minister to Jews; and
the Council of Beziers (1246) condemned the employment of Jewish
physicians by Christians. The Council of Avignon (1209) retaliated
Jewish laws of cleanliness by enjoi ning “Jews and harlots” from
touching bread or fruit exposed for sale; it renewed Church laws against
the hiring of Christian servants by Jews; and it warned the faithful not
to exchange services with Jews, but to avoid them as a pollution. 125
Several councils declared null the marriage of a Christian with a Jew.
In 1 222 a deacon was burned at the stake for accepting conversion to
Judaism and marrying a Jewess. 120 In 1234 a Jewish widow was refused
her dower on the ground that her husband had been converted to
Christianity, thereby voiding their marriage. 127 The Fourth Council of
the Lateran (1215), arguing that “at times through error</p>
<p>388 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>cians, scholars, financiers, and travelers were often exempted from
the de- cree. Its observance declined after the sixteenth century, and
ended with the French Revolution.</p>
<p>By and large, the popes were the most tolerant prelates in
Christendom. Gregory I, though so zealous for the spread of the faith,
forbade the com- pulsory conversion of Jews, and maintained their rights
of Roman citizen- ship in lands under his rule. 128 When bishops in
Terracina and Palermo appropriated synagogues for Christian use, Gregory
compelled them to make full restitution. 129 To the bishop of Naples he
wrote: “Do not allow the Jews to be molested in the performance of their
services. Let them have full liberty to observe and keep all their
festivals and holydays, as both they and their fathers have done for so
long.” 130 Gregory VII urged Christian rulers to obey conciliar decrees
against the appointment of Jews. When Eu- genius III came to Paris in
1145, and went in pomp to the cathedral, which was then in the Jewish
quarter, the Jews sent a delegation to present him with the Torah, or
scroll of the Law; he blessed them, they went home happy, and the Pope
ate a paschal lamb with the king. 131 Alexander III was friendly to
Jews, and employed one to manage his finances. 132 Innocent III led the
Fourth Lateran Council in its demand for a Jewish badge, and laid down
the principle that all Jews were doomed to perpetual servitude because
they had crucified Jesus. 133 In a softer mood he reiterated papal
injunctions against forcible conversions, and added: “No Christian shall
do the Jews any per - sonal injury … or deprive them of their
possessions … or disturb them dur- ing the celebration of their
festivals … or extort money from them by threatening to exhume their
dead,” 134 Gregory IX, founder of the Inquisi - tion, exempted the Jews
from its operation or jurisdiction except when they tried to Judaize
Christians, or attacked Christianity, or reverted to Judaism after
conversion to Christianity; 135 and in 1235 he issued a bull denouncing
mob violence against Jews. 136 Innocent IV (1247) repudiated the legend
of the ritual murder of Christian children by Jews:</p>
<p>Certain of the clergy and princes, nobles and great lords . . .
have</p>
<p>falsely devised godless plans against the Jews, unjustly
depriving</p>
<p>them of their property by force, and appropriating it to themselves;
they falsely charge them with dividing among them on the Passover the
heart of a murdered boy. … In fact, in their malice, they ascribe</p>
<p>to Jews every murder, wherever it chance to occur. And on the</p>
<p>ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage</p>
<p>against them, rob them . . . oppress them by starvation,
imprison-</p>
<p>ment, torture, and other sufferings, sometimes even condemning them
to death; so that the Jews, though living under Christian princes, are
in worse plight than were their ancestors under the Pharaohs. They are
driven to leave in despair the land in which their fathers have</p>
<p>dwelt since the memory of man. Since it is our pleasure that they
shall</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS</p>
<p>not be distressed, we ordain that you behave toward them in a
friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come</p>
<p>under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to
be visited in the future by similar tribulations. 137</p>
<p>This noble appeal was widely ignored. In 1272 Gregory X had to repeat
its denunciation of the ritual murder legend; and to give his words
force he ruled that thereafter the testimony of a Christian against a
Jew should not be accepted unless confirmed by a Jew. 138 The issuance
of similar bulls by later popes till 1763 attests both the humanity of
the popes and the persistence of the evil. That the popes were sincere
is indicated by the comparative security of the Jews, and their relative
freedom from persecution, in the Papal States. Expelled from so many
countries at one time or another, they were never expelled from Rome or
from papal Avignon. “Had it not been for the Catho - lic Church,” writes
a learned Jewish historian, “the Jews would not have sur - vived the
Middle Ages in Christian Europe.” 139</p>
<p>Before the Crusades the active persecution of Jews in medieval Europe
was sporadic. The Byzantine emperors continued for two centuries the op-
pressive policies of Justinian toward the Jews. Heraclius (628) banished
them from Jerusalem in retaliation for their aid to Persia, and did all
he could to exterminate them. Leo the Isaurian sought to disprove the
rumor that he was Jewish by a decree (723) giving Byzantine Jews a
choice between Chris- tianity or banishment. Some submitted; some burned
themselves to death in their synagogues rather than yield. 140 Basil I
(867-86) resumed the campaign to enforce baptism upon the Jews; and
Constantine VII (912-59) required from Jews in Christian courts a
humiliating form of oath — more Judaico — which continued in use in
Europe till the nineteenth century. 141</p>
<p>When, in 1095, Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade, some
Chris- tians thought it desirable to kill the Jews of Europe before
proceeding so far to fight Turks in Jerusalem. Godfrey of Bouillon,
having accepted the lead- ership of the crusade, announced that he would
avenge the blood of Jesus upon the Jews, and would leave not one of them
alive; and his companions proclaimed their intention to kill all Jews
who would not accept Christianity. A monk further aroused Christian
ardor by declaring that an inscription found on the Holy Sepulcher in
Jerusalem made the conversion of all Jews a moral obligation of all
Christians. 142 The Crusaders planned to move south along the Rhine,
where lay the richest settlements in northern Europe. The German Jews
had played a leading part in the development of Rhenish com- merce, and
had behaved with a restraint and piety that had won the respect of
Christian laity and clergy alike. Bishop Rudiger of Speyer was on
cordial terms with the Jews of his district, and gave them a charter
guaranteeing their autonomy and security. In 1095 the Emperor Henry IV
issued a simi- lar charter for all the Jews of his realm. 143 Upon these
peaceful Jewish con- gregations the news of the crusade, its proposed
route, and the threats of its</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>leaders, broke with paralyzing terror. The rabbis proclaimed several
days of fasting and prayer.</p>
<p>Arrived at Speyer, the Crusaders dragged eleven Jews into a church,
and ordered them to accept baptism; refusing, the eleven were slain (May
3,</p>
<p>1096). Other Jews of the city took refuge with Bishop Johannsen, who
not only protected them but caused the execution of certain Crusaders
who had shared in the murders at the church. As some Crusaders neared
Trier, its Jews appealed to Bishop Egilbert; he offered protection on
condition of baptism. Most of the Jews consented; but several women
killed their children and threw themselves into the Moselle (June 1,
1096). At Mainz Archbishop Ruthard hid 1 300 Jews in his cellars;
Crusaders forced their way in, and killed 1014; the Bishop was able to
save a few by concealing them in the ca- thedral (May 27, 1096) . Four
Mainz Jews accepted baptism, but committed suicide soon afterward. As
the Crusaders approached Cologne, the Christians hid the Jews in their
homes; the mob burned down the Jewish quarter, and killed the few Jews
upon whom they could lay their hands. Bishop Hermann, at great danger to
himself, secretly conveyed the Jews from their Christian hiding places
to Christian homes in the country; the pilgrims discovered the maneuver,
hunted their prey in the villages, and killed every Jew they found
(June, 1096) . In two of these villages 200 Jews were slain; in four
others the Jews, surrounded by the mob, killed one another rather than
be baptized. Mothers delivered of infants during these attacks slew them
at birth. At Worms Bishop Allebranches received such of the Jews as he
could into his palace, and saved them; upon the rest the Crusaders fell
with the savagery of anonymity, killing many, and then plundering and
burning the homes of the Jews; here many Jews committed suicide rather
than repudiate their faith. Seven days later a crowd besieged the
episcopal residence; the Bishop told the Jews that he could no longer
hold back the mob, and advised them to accept baptism. The Jews asked to
be left alone for a while; when the Bishop returned he found that nearly
all of them had killed one another. The be- siegers broke in and slew
the rest; all in all, some 800 Jews died in this pogrom at Worms (August
20, 1096). Similar scenes occurred at Metz, Regensburg, and Prague.
144</p>
<p>The Second Crusade (1147) threatened to better the example of the
First. Peter the Venerable, the saintly Abbot of Cluny, advised Louis
VII of France to begin by attacking the French Jews. “I do not require
you to put to death these accursed beings . . . God does not wish to
annihilate them; but, like Cain the fratricide, they must be made to
suffer fearful torments, and be preserved for greater ignominy, for an
existence more bitter than death.” 145 Abbot Suger of St. Denis
protested against this conception of Christianity, and Louis VII
contented himself with capital levies on rich Jews. But the German Jews
were not let off with mere confiscation. A French monk, Ro- dolphe,
leaving his monastery without permission, preached a pogrom in</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 39I</p>
<p>Germany. At Cologne Simon “the Pious” was murdered and mutilated; at
Speyer a woman was tortured on the rack to persuade her to Christianity.
Again the secular prelates did all they could to protect the Jews.
Bishop Arnold of Cologne gave them a fortified castle as refuge, and
allowed them to arm themselves; the Crusaders refrained from attacking
the castle, but killed any unconverted Jew that fell into their
clutches. Archbishop Henry at Mainz admitted into his house some Jews
pursued by a mob; the mob forced a way in, and killed them before his
eyes. The Archbishop appealed to St. Bernard, the most influential
Christian of his time; Bernard replied with a strong denunciation of
Rodolphe, and demanded an end to violence against the Jews. When
Rodolphe continued his campaign Bernard came in person to Germany, and
forced the monk to return to his monastery. Shortly there- after the
mutilated body of a Christian was found at Wurzburg; Christians charged
Jews with the crime, attacked them despite the protests of Bishop
Embicho, and killed twenty; many others, wounded, were tended by Chris-
tians (1147); and the Bishop buried the dead in his garden. 146 From
Germany the idea of beginning the Crusades at home passed back to
France, and Jews were massacred at Carentan, Rameru, and Sully. In
Bohemia 1 50 Jews were murdered by Crusaders. After the terror had
passed, the local Christian clergy did what it could to help the
surviving Jews; and those who had ac- cepted baptism under duress were
allowed to return to Judaism without in- curring the dire penalties of
apostasy. 147</p>
<p>These pogroms began a long series of violent assaults, which
continued till our time. In 1235 an unsolved murder at Baden was laid to
the Jews, and a massacre ensued. In 1243 the entire Jewish population of
Belitz, near Berlin, was burned alive on the charge that some of them
had defiled a consecrated Host. 14S In 1 283 the accusation of ritual
murder was raised at Mainz, and de- spite all the efforts of Archbishop
Werner, ten Jews were killed, and Jewish homes were pillaged. In 1 285 a
like rumor excited Munich; 1 80 Jews fled for refuge to a synagogue; the
mob set fire to it, and all 180 were burned to death. A year later forty
Jews were killed at Oberwesel on the charge that they had drained the
blood of a Christian. In 1298 every Jew in Rottingen was burned to death
on the charge of desecrating a sacramental wafer. Rind- fleisch, a pious
baron, organized and armed a band of Christians sworn to kill all Jews;
they completely exterminated the Jewish community at Wurzburg, and slew
698 Jews in Nuremberg. The persecution spread, and in half a year 140
Jewish congregations were wiped out. 149 The Jews of Germany, having
repeatedly rebuilt their communities after such attacks, lost heart; and
in 1286 many Jewish families left Mainz, Worms, Speyer, and other German
towns, and migrated to Palestine to live in Islam. As Poland and
Lithuania were inviting immigrants, and had not yet experienced pogroms,
a slow ex- odus of Jews from the Rhineland began to the Slavic East.</p>
<p>The Jews of England, excluded from landholding and from the
guilds,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>39 2</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>became merchants and financiers. Some waxed rich through usury, and
all were hated for it. Lords and squires equipped themselves for the
Crusades with money borrowed from the Jews; in return they pledged the
revenues of their lands; and the Christian peasant fumed at the thought
of money- lenders fattening on his toil. In 1144 young William of
Norwich was found dead; the Jews were accused of having killed him to
use his blood; and the Jewish quarter of the city was sacked and fired.
150 King Henry II protected the Jews; Henry III did likewise, but took
^42 2,000 from them in taxes and capital levies in seven years. At the
coronation of Richard I in London ( 1 190) a minor altercation,
encouraged by nobles seeking escape from their debts to Jews, 151
developed into a pogrom that spread to Lincoln, Stamford, and Linn. In
York, in the same year, a mob led by Richard de Malabestia, “who was
deeply indebted to the Jews,” 152 killed 350 of them; in addition 150
York Jews, led by their Rabbi Yom Tob, slew themselves. 153 In 1 2 1 1
300 rabbis left England and France to begin life anew in Palestine;
seven years later many Jews emigrated when Henry III enforced the edict
of the badge. In 1 255 rumor spread through Lincoln that a boy named
Hugh had been en- ticed into the Jewish quarter and there had been
scourged, crucified, and pierced with a lance, in the presence of a
rejoicing Jewish crowd. Armed bands invaded the settlement, seized the
rabbi who was supposed to have pre- sided over the ceremony, tied him to
the tail of a horse, dragged him through the streets, and hanged him.
Ninety-one Jews were arrested, eighteen were hanged; many prisoners were
saved by the intercession of courageous Do- minican monks.* 154</p>
<p>During the civil war that disordered England between 1 257 and 1267,
the populace got out of hand, and pogroms almost wiped out the Jewish
com- munities of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Winchester, Worcester,
Lincoln, and Cambridge. Houses were looted and destroyed, deeds and
bonds were burned, and the surviving Jews were left almost penniless.
155 The English kings were now borrowing from the Christian bankers of
Flor- ence or Cahors; they no longer needed the Jews, and found it
troublesome to protect them. In 1290 Edward I ordered the 16,000
remaining Jews of England to leave the country by November 1, abandoning
all their immova- ble realty and all their collectible loans. Many were
drowned in crossing the Channel in small boats; some were robbed by the
ships’ crews; those who reached France were told by the government that
they must leave by Lent of 1291. 156</p>

<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE MEDIEVAL JEWS 393</p>
<p>In France, too, the spiritual climate changed for the Jews with the
Cru- sades against the Turks in Asia and the Albigensian heretics of
Languedoc. Bishops preached anti-Semitic sermons that stirred the
people; at Beziers an attack upon the Jewish quarter was a regular rite
of Holy Week; finally (1 160) a Christian prelate forbade such
preaching, but required the Jewish community to pay a special tax every
Palm Sunday. 157 At Toulouse the Jews were forced to send a
representative to the cathedral each Good Friday to receive publicly a
box on the ears as a mild reminder of everlasting guilt. 158 In 1 17 1
several Jews were burned at Blois on a charge of using Christian blood
in Passover rites. 159 Seeing a chance to turn a pious penny, King
Philip Augustus ordered all the Jews in his realm to be imprisoned as
poisoners of Christian wells, 160 and then released them on payment of a
heavy ransom ( 1 1 80) . A year later he banished them, confiscated all
their realty, and gave their synagogues to the Church. In 1190 he had
eighty Jews of Orange killed because one of his agents had been hanged
by the city authorities for mur- dering a Jew. 161 In 1 198 he recalled
the Jews to France, and so regulated their banking business as to secure
large profits to himself. 162 In 1236 Christian crusaders invaded the
Jewish settlements of Anjou and Poitou — especially those at Bordeaux
and Angouleme — and bade all Jews be baptized; when the Jews refused,
the crusaders trampled 3000 of them to death under their horses’ hoofs.
163 Pope Gregory IX condemned the slaughter, but did not raise the dead.
St. Louis advised his people not to discuss religion with Jews; “the
layman,” he told Joinville, “when he hears any speak ill of the
Christian faith, should defend it not with words but with the sword,
which he should thrust into the other’s belly as far as it will go.” 164
In 1254 he banished the Jews from France, confiscating their property
and their synagogues; a few years later he readmitted them, and restored
their synagogues. They were rebuild- ing their communities when Philip
the Fair ( 1 306) had them all imprisoned, confiscated their credits and
all their goods except the clothes they wore, and expelled them, to the
number of 100,000, from France, with provisions for one day. The King
profited so handsomely from the operation that he pre- sented a
synagogue to his coachman. 165</p>
<p>So crowded a juxtaposition of bloody episodes scattered over two cen-
turies makes a one-sided picture. In Provence, Italy, Sicily, and in the
Byzan- tine Empire after the ninth century there were only minor
persecutions of the Jews; and they found means of protecting themselves
in Christian Spain. Even in Germany, England, and France the periods of
peace were long; and a generation after each tragedy the Jews there were
again numerous, and some were prosperous. Nevertheless their traditions
carried down the bitter memory of those tragic interludes. The days of
peace were made anxious by the ever-present danger of pogroms; and every
Jew had to learn by heart the prayer to be recited in the moment of
martyrdom. 166 The pursuit of wealth was made more feverish by the
harassed insecurity of its gains; the gibes of</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>gamins in the street were ever ready to greet the wearers of the
yellow badge; the ignominy of a helpless and secluded minority burned
into the soul, broke down individual pride and interracial amity, and
left in the eyes of the north- ern Jew that somber Judenschmerz — the
sorrow of the Jews — which recalls a thousand insults and injuries.</p>
