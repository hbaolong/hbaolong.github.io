<p>1643-84</p>
<p>I. MAZAR1N AND THE FRONDE: 1 643-6 1</p>
<p>W HY is it that from 1 643 France exercised an almost hypnotic domi-
nance over Western Europe, in politics till 1763, in language,
liter-</p>
<p>ature, and art dll 1815? Not since Augustus had any monarchy been so
adorned with great writers, painters, sculptors, and architects, or so
widely admired and imitated in manners, fashions, ideas, and arts, as
the govern- ment of Louis XIV from 1643 to 1715. Foreigners came to
Paris as to a finishing school for all graces of body and mind.
Thousands of Italians, Germans, even Englishmen, preferred Paris to
their native lands.</p>
<p>One reason for French domination was manpower. France had a popu-
lation of 20,000,000 in 1660, while Spain and England had 5,000,000
each, Italy 6,000,000, the Dutch Republic 2,000,000. The Holy Roman
Empire, which included Germany, Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary, had some
21,- 000,000; but it was an empire only in name, recently impoverished
by the Thirty Years’ War, and divided into over four hundred jealously
“sov - ereign” states, nearly all small and weak, each with its own
ruler, army, currency, and laws, and none with more than 2,000,000
inhabitants. France, after 1660, was a geographically compact nation,
united under one strong central government; so Richelieu’s painful
midwifery had helped the birth of le grand siecle.</p>
<p>In the long duel between the Hapsburgs and the French kings the Bour-
bons won where the Valois had lost. Decade after decade some portion of
the Empire fell to France, and Hapsburg Spain surrendered her pride and
leadership at Rocroi (1643) and the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659). There-
after the French state was the strongest in Christendom, confident in
its natural resources, the skills and loyalty of its people, the
strategy of its generals, the destiny of its King. It was of some
moment, too, that this youth was to reign for almost three quarters of a
century, adding unity of government and policy to unity of race and
soil. Now for fifty years France would support and import geniuses in
science and letters, build colossal palaces, equip immense armies,
frighten and inspire half the world. It was to be a picture of almost
unprecedented glory, painted in all the forms and colors of art, and in
the blood of men.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>When Louis XIV, aged five, came to the throne (1643), France was not
yet unified, and another cardinal had to complete the work of Richelieu.
In Italy Jules Mazarin had been Guilio Mazarini, bom in the Abruzzi of
poor Sicilian parentage, educated by the Jesuits in Rome, serving the
popes as a diplomatic agent, and suddenly catching the eye of Europe by
nego- tiating, at a critical moment, an end to the Mantuan War (1630).
Sent as papal nuncio to Paris, he tied his fortunes to the commanding
genius of Richelieu, who rewarded his fidelity with a cardinal’s hat.
When Rich elieu heard the summons of death, he “assured the King that he
knew of no one more capable than Mazarin of filling his place.” 1 Louis
XIII took the advice.</p>
<p>On the death of this obedient sovereign (1643), Mazarin remained in
the background while the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria, took the regency
for her son, and Louis de Conde and Gaston d’Orl6ans, princes of the
blood, maneuvered to be the power behind the throne. They never forgave
her for passing them by and calling the handsome Italian, now forty-one,
to be her chief minister. On the day after his appointment Paris hailed
the news of the epochal victory at Rocroi; Mazarin’s rule began
auspiciously, and was buttressed by many successes in diplomacy and war.
His choice of policies, generals, and negotiators proved his
intelligence. It was under his guidance that the Peace of Westphalia
(1648) confirmed to France the supremacy that her arms had won.</p>
<p>Not dowered with Richelieu’s unity and strength of will, Mazarin had
to rely on patience, craft, and charm. He had the disadvantage of
foreign birth. He assured France that though his tongue was Italian his
heart was French, but he was never quite believed; his head was Italian,
and his heart was his own. We do not know how much of it he gave to the
Queen; he served her and his ambition zealously, and won her affection,
perhaps her love. He knew that his safety and hers lay in continuing
Richelieu’s policy of building up the power of the monarchy against the
feudal lords. To feather his nest in the event of a fall, he accumulated
wealth with all the greed of poverty remembered or feared; and France,
which was be- ginning to admire measure, condemned him as a parvenu. It
resented his Italian accent, his costly relatives, especially his
nieces, whose beauty de- manded a lavish equipage. Cardinal de Retz,
himself no Grandison of vir- tue, scorned him as “a sordid soul… a
complete trickster… a villainous heart”; 2 but de Retz; defeated by
Mazarin, was in no cond ition to be just. If the wily minister gathered
riches without dignity, he spent them with taste, filling his rooms with
books and art that he later bequeathed to France. He had a gay and
courtly way that pleased the ladies and baffled the men. The jud icious
Mme. de Motteville described him as “full of</p>
<p>gentleness, and far removed from the severity of” Richelieu. 8 He
readily pardoned opposition, and readily forgot benefits. All agreed
that he labored</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>irelessly in the government of France, but even his industry could
offend, for sometimes he left titled visitors waiting fretfully in his
anterooms. He thought everybody corruptible, and was insensitive to
integrity. His per- sonal morals were proper enough if we set aside the
gossip that he made a mistress of his Queen. Many persons at the court
were shocked by his skep- tical wit about religion, 4 for such
irreverence was not yet fashionable; they attributed his religious
toleration to lack of religious belief. 5 One of his first acts was to
confirm the Edict of Nantes. He allowed the Huguenots to hold their
synods in peace; and during his ministry no Frenchman suffered religious
persecution by the central government.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how long he held his power despite his
unpopularity. The peasants hated him because they were bitterly burdened
by the taxes with which he waged war. The merchants hated him because
his imposts injured commerce. The nobles hated him because he did not
agree with them about the virtues of feudalism. The parlements hated him
because he set himself and the King above the law. The Queen heightened
his unpopularity by forbidding criticism of his rule. She supported him
be- cause she found herself challenged by two groups that saw in the
infancy of the King and the supposed weakness of the woman an opening to
power: the nobles who hoped to restore their former feudal privileges at
the expense of the monarchy, and the parlements that aspired to make the
government an oligarchy of lawyers. Against these two forces — the old
aristocracy of the sword ( noblesse d’epee ) and the younger
aristocracy</p>
<p>The Parlement of Paris launched the first Fronde (1648-49), seeking
to duplicate in France the movement that in England had just raised
Parlia- ment above the king as the source and judge of law. The Paris
Parlement was, below the king, the supreme court of France; and by
tradition no law or tax received public acceptance until these
magistrates (nearly all law- yers) had registered the law or the tax.
Richelieu had reduced or ignored these powers; now the Parlement was
resolved to assert them. It felt that the time had come to make the
French monarchy constitutional, subject to the national will as
expressed by some representative assembly. The twelve parlements of
France, however, were not legislative chambers chosen by the nation,
like the Parliament of England; they were judiciary and administrative
bodies whose members inherited their seats or magis- tracies from their
fathers, or were appointed by the king. The success of the first Fronde
would have made the French government an aristocracy of lawyers. The
States-General, composed of delegates from the three etats (states or
classes) — nobles, clergy, and the remainder of the people —</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>could have been developed into a representative assembly checking the
monarchy; but the States-General could be summoned only by the king; no
king had summoned it since 1614, none would summon it till 1789; hence
the Revolution.</p>
<p>The Parlement of Paris became indirectly and momentarily representa-
tive when its members dared to speak for the nation. So Omer Talon,
early in 1648, denounced the taxes that under Richelieu and Mazarin had
impoverished the people:</p>
<p>For ten years France has been reduced to ruin. The peasantry must</p>
<p>sleep upon straw, for their effects have been sold to pay taxes.
To</p>
<p>enable certain people to live in luxury in Paris, countless
innocent</p>
<p>persons must survive on the meanest bread… owning nothing but their
souls — and that merely because nobody has devised a means to put them
up for sale. 6</p>
<p>On July 12 the Parlement, meeting in the Palais de Justice with other
courts of Paris, addressed to the King and his mother several demands
that must have seemed to them revolutionary. All personal taxes were to
be reduced by one quarter; no new taxes were to be levied without the
freely voted consent of the Parlement; the royal commissioners
(intendants), who had been ruling the provinces over the heads of local
governors and magistrates, were to be dismissed; and no person was to be
kept in prison beyond twenty-four hours without being brought before the
proper judges. If these demands had been met they would have made the
French government a constitutional monarchy, and would have put France
abreast of England in political development.</p>
<p>The Queen Mother had stronger roots in the past than vision of the
future. She had never experienced any other form of government than ab-
solute monarchy; such a surrender of royal power as was now proposed
must, she felt, irreparably crack the established mold of rule,
undermine its psychological support in tradition and custom, and bring
it down, sooner or later, into the chaos of the sovereign crowd. And
what a disgrace it would be to transmit to her son anything less than
the power that his father (or Richelieu) had enjoyed! This would be a
dereliction of duty, and condemn her at the bar of history. Mazarin
agreed with her, seeing his own evaporation in these insolent demands
from the pedants of the law. On August 26 he ordered the arrest of
Pierre Broussel and other lead- ers of Parlement. But the aged Broussel
had become popular with his motto, Pas d’impostes — “No taxes.” A mob
gathered before the Palais - Royal and clamored for his release. The
slings or catapults that many in the crowd carried earned them the name
frondeurs, throwers, and gave a name to the revolt. Jean Frangois Paul
de Gondi — later de Retz — coadjutor</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>and prospective successor to the Archbishop of Paris, advised the
Queen to release Broussel. When she refused he retired in anger and
helped to rouse the people against the government. Meanwhile he pulled
wires in an effort to obtain a cardinal’s hat, and attended to three
mistresses.</p>
<p>On August 27 the members of Parlement, 160 in number, made their way
to the royal palace through crowds and barricades. They were spurred on
by cries of “Vive le rot! A mort Mazarin!” The cautious minister thought
it time for discretion rather than valor; he advised the Queen to order
Broussel’s release. She consented; then, furious at this concession to
the crowd, she withdrew with the boy King to the suburb Rueil. Mazarin
provisionally granted the demands of the Parlement, but dallied in their
enforcement. The barricades remained in the streets; when the Queen
ventured to return to Paris the crowd shouted its scorn at her, and she
heard its jokes about her relations with Mazarin. On January 6, 1649,
she again fled from the city, this time with the royal family and the
court to St.-Germain, where silk slept on straw and the Queen pawned her
jewels to buy food. The young King never forgave that crowd, never loved
his capital.</p>
<p>On January 8 the Parlement, in full rebellion, issued a decree
outlawing Mazarin, and urging all good Frenchmen to hunt him down as a
criminal. Another decree ordered the seizure of all royal funds, and
their use in the common defense. Many nobles saw in the revolt a chance
to win the Parlement to the restoration of feudal privileges; perhaps
also they</p>
<p>feared that the uprising would get out of hand without pedigreed
leader- ship. Great lords like the Dues de Longueville, de Beaufort, and
de Bouillon, even the Prince de Conti of royal Bourbon blood, joined the
rebellion, and brought to it soldiers, funds, and romance. The Duchesse
de Bouillon and the Duchesse de Longueville — beautiful despite smallpox
— came with their children to live in the Hotel de Ville as voluntary
hostages guaranteeing the fidelity of their husbands to the Parlement
and the people. While Paris became an armed camp, titled ladies danced
in the City Hall, and the Duchesse de Longueville carried on a liaison
with the Prince de Marsillac, who was not yet the Due de La
Rochefoucauld, and not yet cynical. On January 28 the Duchesse raised
the morale of the revolt by giving birth to Marsillac’s son. 7 Many
Frondeurs bound themselves as chivalric servitors to highborn ladies,
who bought their blood with a condescending smile.</p>
<p>The situation was saved for the Queen by a feud between the Prince de
Conti and his older brother Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Conde — the
“Great Conde” who had led French arms to victory at Rocroi and Lens.
Turning up his powerful nose at the insurgence of lawyers and populace,
he offered his services to Queen and King. Gladly she commissioned him
to lead an army against rebellious Paris — against his brother, against
his</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>sister the Duchesse de Longueville — and take the royal family back
in safety to the Palais-Royal. Conde gathered troops, laid siege to
Paris, captured the fortified outpost of Charenton. The rebel nobles
appealed for aid to Spain and the Empire. It was a mistake; the
sentiment of patriotism was stronger in Parlement and people than the
feeling of class. Most mem- bers of Parlement refused to annul the work
and victories of Richelieu by restoring the Hapsburg ascendancy over
France; and they began to see that they themselves were being used as
pawns in an attempt to restore a feudalism that would again divide
France into regions individually in- dependent and collectively
impotent. In a revulsion of humility they sent a deputation to the
approaching Queen; they offered their submission, and protested that
they had always loved her. She granted a general amnesty to all who
would lay down their arms. Parlement dismissed its troops, and informed
the people that obedience to the King was the order of the day. The
barricades were removed; Anne, Louis, and Mazarin returned to the royal
seat (August 28, 1649); the court reassembled, and the rebel nobles
joined it as if nothing but a trifling unpleasantness had occurred. All
was forgiven, nothing was forgotten. The first Fronde was ended.</p>
<p>There was a second. Conde felt that his services entitled him to sub-
ordinate Mazarin. They quarreled; Conde flirted with the discontented
nobles; Mazarin, in his boldest moment, had Conde, Conti, and
Longueville imprisoned at Vincennes (January 18, 1650). Mme. de
Longueville rushed up to Normandy, raised rebellion there, passed on to
the Spanish Nether- lands, and charmed Turenne into treason; the great
general agreed to lead a Spanish army against Mazarin. “All parties,”
said Voltaire, “came into</p>
<p>collision with each other, made treaties, and betrayed each other in
turn</p>
<p>There was not a man who did not frequently change sides.” 8 “We
were</p>
<p>A royal force maneuvered Bordeaux into surrender; and Mazarin, play-
ing Mars, led an army toward Flanders and defeated the invincible
Turenne. Meanwhile de Retz, eager to replace the Queen’s minister and
lover, persuaded the Parlement to renew its demand for the exile of
Mazarin. Losing his nerve, the Cardinal ordered the release of the
imprisoned princes (February 13, 1651), and then, fearing for his life,
he fled to Briihl, near Cologne. Conde, hot for revenge against minister
and Queen, brought his brother Conti, his sister Longueville, and the
Dues de Nemours and de La Rochefoucauld into a new alliance. In
September they declared war, captured Bordeaux, and made it again a
citadel of revolt. Conde signed an</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>alliance with Spain, negotiated with Cromwell, and promised to
establish a republic in France.</p>
<p>On September 8 Louis XIV, aged thirteen, announced that he was ending
the regency of his mother, and was taking the government into his own
hands. To appease the Parlement he confirmed Mazarin’s banishment; but
in November, gaining courage, he recalled the minister, who came back to
France at the head of an army. Gaston d’Orleans now played neutral, but
Turenne came over to the royal cause. In March, 1652, Louis sent Mole,
keeper of the seals, to demand the allegiance of the city of Orleans.
Its magistrates dispatched a message to Gaston that unless he or his
daughter came to inspire the citizens to resist, they would deliver the
city to the King.</p>
<p>At this point one of the most famous of France’s many famous women
rode upon the scene, like another Joan rescuing Orleans. Anne Marie
Louise d’Orleans had become a rebel in her childhood, when Richelieu
exiled her father. Gaston, as brother of Louis XIII, was officially “Mon
- sieur”; his wife, Marie de Bourbon, Duchesse de Montpensier, was the
curre nt “Madame”; their daughter was thereby “Mademoiselle”; and
because she was strong and tall, she came to be called La Grande
Mademoi- selle de Montpensier. As the Montpensier fortune was immense,
she grew up with the double pride of money and ancestry. “I am of a
birth,” she said, “that does nothing that is not great and noble.” 10
She aspired to marry Louis XIV, though he was her cousin; when she
received no encourage- ment she nursed revolt. Hearing the appeal of her
city, and seeing her father loath to commit himself, she won his consent
to go in his place. She had long resented the l limitations put upon her
sex by custom; especially she recognized no reason why women should not
be warriors. Now she arrayed herself in armor and helmet, gathered about
her some highborn Amazons and a small force of soldiery, and led them
gaily to Orleans. The magistrates refused to admit her, fearing the
wrath of the King. She ordered some of her men to break a hole in the
walls; through this she and two countesses entered, while the guardians
napped or winked. Once within, her flaming oratory captured the
citizens; Mole was sent away with- out his prize, and Orleans vowed
fidelity to its new Maid.</p>
<p>The second Fronde reached its climax at the gates of Paris. Conde</p>
<p>marched up from the south, defeated a royal army, and came within an
ace of capturing King, Queen, and Cardinal, which would have been check-
mate indeed. As his army neared Paris the populace, again Frondeurs,
carried a shrine of the city’s patron St. Genevieve through the streets
in processional prayer for the victory of Conde and the overthrow of
Mazarin. La Grande Mademoiselle, hurrying up from Orleans to the
Luxembourg Palace, where her father was still playing with pros and
cons, begged him</p>
<p>IO THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. I</p>
<p>o support Conde; he refused. Turenne and the King’s army now ap -
proached, and met Conde’s forces outside the walls, near the Porte St. -
Antoine (now the Place de la Bastille). Turenne was winning when</p>
<p>Mademoiselle rushed into the Bastille and prodded its governor to
turn its cannon upon the royal troops. Then, in the name of her absent
father, she commanded the people within the walls to open the gates just
long enough to let Conde’s army in and shut out the King’s (July 2,
1652). Made -</p>
<p>moiselle was the heroine of the day.</p>
<p>Conde was master of Paris, but level heads were turning against him.
He could not pay his troops; they began to desert, and the populace ran
riot. On July 4 a mob attacked the City Hall, demanding that all
supporters of Mazarin be given up to them; to indicate their temper they
set fire to the building, and killed thirty citizens. Economic
operations were disrupted; the food supply fell into chaos; every second
family in Paris feared starva- tion. The propertied classes began to
wonder whether royal autocracy, or even government by Mazarin, was not
better than mob rule. Mazarin helped by going into voluntary exile,
leaving the Frondeurs without a unifying cause. De Retz, having obtained
his coveted red hat, thought it time to consolidate his gains, and now
used his influence to encourage loyalty to the King.</p>
<p>On October 21 the royal family re-entered Paris peacefully. The sight
of the young monarch, fourteen, handsome, and brave, charmed the
Parisians; the streets resounded with “Vive le roi!” Almost overnight
public agitation subsided, and order was restored, not by force but by
the aura of royalty, the prestige of legitimacy, the half-unconscious
belief of the people in the divine right of kings. By February 6, 1653,
Louis felt strong enough to recall Mazarin again, and to re-establish
him in all his former powers. The second Fronde was over.</p>
<p>Conde fled to Bordeaux, Parlement submitted gravely, the rebel nobles
retired to their chateaux. Mme. de Longueville, no longer lovely, sought
solace among the nuns of Port-Royal. La Grande Mademoiselle was</p>
<p>banished to one of her estates, where she ate her heart out recalling
the remark ascribed to Mazarin, that her cannonade from the Bastille had
killed her husband — i.e., ended her chance of marrying the King. At the
age of forty she fell in love with Antoine de Caumont, Comte de Lauzun,
who was much younger and shorter; the King refused permission for the
marriage; when they proposed to marry nevertheless, Louis imprisoned him
for ten years (1670-80). Mademoiselle remained bravely loyal to him
through all that time; when he was released she married him, and she
lived in turmoil with him till her death (1693). De Retz was arrested,
escaped, was pardoned, served the King as a diplomat in Rome, retired to
a corner in Lorraine, and composed his memoirs, remarkable for their
objective analysis of character, including his own:</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE SUN RISES II</p>
<p>I did not act the devotee, because I could not be sure how long I</p>
<p>should be able to play the counterfeit…. Finding I could not live</p>
<p>without some amorous intrigue, I managed an amour with Mme.</p>
<p>de Pommereux, a young coquette, who had so many sparks, not only in
her house but at her devotions, that the apparent business of others was
a cover for mine…. I came to a resolve to go on in my sins…</p>
<p>but I was fully determined to discharge all the duties of my
[religious] profession faithfully, and exert my utmost to save other
souls, though I took no care of my own. 11</p>
<p>As for Mazarin, he had landed safely on his feet, and was again
master of the realm, under a King still willing to learn. To the scandal
of France, the minister arranged a treaty with Protestant England and
regicide Cromwell (1657), who sent six thousand troops to help fight
Conde and the Spanish; together the French and the Engl ish won the
“Battle of the Dunes” (June 13, 1658). Ten days later the Spanish
surrendered Dunkirk; Louis entered it in state, and then, pursuant to
the treaty, gave it to England. Exhausted in money and men, Spain signed
with France the Peace of the Pyrenees (November 7, 1659), ending
twenty-three years of one war and establishing the basis of another.
Spain ceded Roussillon, Artois, Gravelines, and Thionville to France,
and abandoned all claim to Alsace. Philip IV gave his daughter Maria
Teresa in marriage to Louis XIV, on terms that later involved all
Western Europe in the War of the Spanish Succession: he promised to send
her a dowry of 500,000 crowns within eighteen months, but exacted from
her and Louis a renunciation of her rights to succeed to the Spanish
throne. The Spanish King made the</p>
<p>pardon of Conde a condition of the Peace. Louis did not merely
forgive the impetuous Prince, he restored him to all his titles and
estates, and welcomed him to his court.</p>
<p>The Peace of the Pyrenees mark ed the fulfillment of Richelieu’s pro
- gram — the reduction of the Hapsburg power, and the replacement of
Spain by France as the dominant nation in Europe. Mazarin was given the
credit for carrying this policy through triumphantly; though few men
liked him, they recognized him as one of the ablest ministers in French
history. But France, which so soon forgave Conde’s treason, never
forgave Mazarin’s greed. Amid the destitution of the people he amassed a
fortune reckoned by Voltaire at 200,000,000 francs. 12 He deflected
military ap- propriations into his personal coffers, sold crown offices
for his own benefit, lent money to the King at a high rate of interest,
and gave one of his nieces a necklace which is still among the most
costly pieces of jewelry in the world. 13</p>
<p>Dying, he advised Louis to be his own chief minister, and never to
leave major matters of policy to any of his aides. 14 After his death
(March 9,</p>
<p>1661), the hiding place of his hoard was revealed to the King by
Colbert.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Louis confiscated it to the general satisfaction, and became the
richest monarch of his time. The wits of Paris acclaimed as a public
benefactor Mazarin’s physician Guenot: “Make way for his honor! It is
the good</p>
<p>doctor who killed the Cardinal.” 15</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE KING</li>
</ol>
<p>The most famous of French kings was only one-quarter French. He</p>
<p>was half Spanish by his mother, Anne of Austria; he was one-quarter
Italian by his grandmother Marie de Medicis. He took readily to Italian
art and love, afterward to Spanish piety and pride; in his later years
he resembled his maternal grandfather, Philip III of Spain, far more
than his paternal grandfather, Henry IV of France.</p>
<p>At birth (September 5, 1638) he was called Dieudonne, God-given;</p>
<p>perhaps the French could not believe that Louis XIII had really
achieved parentage without divine assistance. The estrangement between
father and mother, the father’s early de ath, and the prolonged
disorders of the Fronde hurt the boy’s development. Amid the struggles
of Anne and Mazarin to</p>
<p>maintain themselves in power Louis was often neglected; at times, in
those unroyal days, he knew poverty in shabby dress and stinted food. No
one seemed to bother about his education; and when tutors took him in
hand their most earnest endeavor was to convince him that all France was
his patrimony, which he would rule by divine right, with no
responsibility except to God. His mother found time to train him in
Catholic doctrine and devotion, which would return to him in force when
passion was spent and glory had worn thin. Saint- Simon assures us that
Louis “was scarcely taught to read or write, and remained so ignorant
that the most familiar historical and other facts were utterly unknown
to him” 16 — but this is probably one of the Duke’s furious
exaggerations. Certainly Louis showed little taste for books, though his
patronage of authors, and his friendship with Moliere, Boileau, and
Racine suggest a sincere appreciation of litera- ture. Later he
regretted that he had come so tardily to the study of history. “The
knowledge of the great events produced in the world through many
centuries, and digested by so lid and active minds,” he wrote, “will
serve to fortify the reason in all important deliberations.” 17 His
mother labored to form in him not merely good manners but a sense of
honor and chivalry, and much of this remained in him, sullied with a
reckless will to power. He was a serious and submissive youth,
apparently too good for govern- ment, but Mazarin declared that Louis
“has in him the stuff to make four kings and an honorable man.” 18</p>
<p>On September 7, 1651, John Evelyn, from the Paris apartment of</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>«3</p>
<p>Thomas Hobbes, watched the procession that escorted the boy monarch,
now thirteen, to the ceremony that was to mark the end of his minority.
“A young Apollo,” the Englishman described him. “He went almost the
whole way with his hat in hand, saluting the ladies and acclamators who
filled the windows with their beauty, and the air with Vive le Roi !” 19
Louis might then have taken over full authority from Mazarin, but he
respected his minister’s suave resourcefulness, and allowed him to hold
the reins for nine years more. Nevertheless, when the Cardinal died he
confessed, “I do not know what I should have done if he had lived much
longer.” 20 A fter Mazarin’s death the heads of the departments came to
Louis and asked to whom henceforth they should address themselves for
instructions. He answered, with decisive simplicity, “To me.” 21 From
that day (March 9,</p>
<ol start="1661" type="1">
<li>till September 1, 1715, he governed France. The people wept with joy
that now, for the first time in half a century, they had a functioning
king.</li>
</ol>
<p>They gloried in his good looks. Seeing him in 1660, Jean de La
Fontaine, a man not easily deceived, exclaimed: “Do you think that the
world has many kings of figure so beautiful, of appearance so fine? I do
not think so, and when I see him I imagine I see Grandeur herself in
person.” 22 He was only five feet five inches tall, but authority made
him seem taller. Well built, robust, a good horseman and good dancer, a
skillful j ouster and fascinating raconteur, he had just the combination
to turn a woman’s head and unlock her heart. Saint- Simon, who disliked
him, wrote: “Had he been just a private individual, he would have
created the same havoc with his love affairs.” 23 And this Duke (who
could never forgive Louis for not letting dukes rule), acknowledged the
royal courtesy that now became a school to the court, through the court
to France, and through France to Europe:</p>
<p>Never did man give with better grace than Louis XIV, or augment</p>
<p>so much in this way the value of his benefits…. Never did disobliging
words escape him; and if he had to blame, to reprimand, or to correct,
which was rare, it was nearly always with goodness, never, except on one
occasion… , with anger or severity. Never was a man so naturally
polite…. Towards women his politeness was without parallel. Never did he
pass the humblest petticoat without raising his hat, even to</p>
<p>chambermaids whom he knew to be such…. If he accosted ladies</p>
<p>he did not cover himself until he had quitted them. 24</p>
<p>His mind was not as good as his manners. He almost matched Napoleon
in his penetrating judgment of men, but he fell far short of
Caesar’s</p>
<p>philoso phical intellect, or Augustus’ humane and farseeing
statesmanship. “He had nothing more than good sense,” said Sainte -
Beuve, “but he had a</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>*4</p>
<p>great deal of it,” 25 and perhaps that is better than intellect. Hear
a gain Saint- Simon: “He was by disposition prudent, moderate, discreet,
the master of his movements and his tongue.” 26 “He had a soul greater
than his mind,” said Montesquieu, 27 and a power of attention and will
that in his heyday made up for the limitation of his ideas. We know his
defects chiefly from the second period (1683-1715) of his reign, when
bigotry had narrowed him, and success and flattery had spoiled him. Then
we shall find him as vain as an actor and as proud as a monument —
though some of this pride may have been put on by the artists who
portrayed him, and some may have been due to his conception of his
office. If he “acted the part” of Le Grand Monarque, he may have thought
this necessary to the technique of rule and the support of order; there
had to be a center of authority, and this authority had to be propped up
with pomp and</p>
<p>ceremony. “It seems to me,” he told his son, “that we should be at
once humble for ourselves and proud for the place we hol d.” 28 But he
rarely achieved humility — perhaps once, when he took no offense at
Boileau’s correcting him on a point of literary taste. In his memoirs he
contemplated his own virtues with great equanimity. The chief of these,
he judged, was his love o f glory; he “preferred to all things,” he
said, “and to life itself, a lofty reputation.” 29 This love of glory
became his nemesis because of its excess. “The ardor that we feel for la
gloire” he wrote, “is not one of those feeble passions that cool with
possession. Her favors, which can never be obtained except with effort,
never cause disgust, and he who can refrain from longing for fresh ones
is unworthy of all those he has re- ceived.” 30</p>
<p>Until his love of glory ruined his character and his country, he had
his share of estimable qualities. His court was impressed by his
justice, lenience, generosity, and self- control. “In this respect,”
said Mme. de Motteville, who saw him almost daily in this period, “all
preceding reigns… must yield p recedence to the happy beginning of this
one.” 31 Those near him noted the fidelity with which, despite a
multitude of affairs, he visited his</p>
<p>mother’s apartments several times each day; later they saw his
tenderness for his children, his solicitude for their health and rearing
— no matter who their mother had been. He had more sympathy for
individuals than for nations; he could make war upon the inoffensive
Dutch, and order the devastation of the Palatinate, but he grieved at
the death of the Dutch Admiral de Ruyter, who had inflicted defeats upon
the French navy; and his pity for the dethroned queen and son of James
II cost him the worst of his wars.</p>
<p>He seems seriously to have believed that he was ordained by God to
govern France, and with absolute power. He could of course quote</p>
<p>Scripture to his purpose, and Bossuet was happy to show him that
both</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>1 5</p>
<p>he Old and the New Testament upheld the divine right of kings. The
memoirs* which he prepared for the guidance of his son informed him that
“God appoints kings the sole guardians of the public weal,” and that
they “are God’s vicars here below.” For the proper exercise of their
divine functions they need unlimited authority; hence they should have
“full and free liberty to dispose of all property, whether in the hands
of the clergy or the laity.” 32 He did not say, “ L’etat , c’est mot”
but he believed it in all simplicity. The people do not appear to have
resented these</p>
<p>assumptions, which Henry IV had made popular in reaction against
social chaos; they even looked up to this royal youth with religious
devotion, and took a collective pride in his magnificence and power; the
only alterna- tive they knew was feudal fragmentation and arrogance.
After the tyranny of Richelieu, the disorder of the Fronde, and the
peculations of Mazarin, the middle and lower classes welcomed the
centralized power and leader- ship of a “legitimate” rul er who seemed
to promise order, security, and peace.</p>
<p>He gave expression to his absolutism when, in 1665, the Parlement of
Paris wished to discuss some of his decrees. He drove from Vincennes in
hunting dress, entered the hall in top boots, whip in han d, and said,
“The misfortunes that your assemblies have brought about are well known.
I order you to break up this assembly which has met to discuss my
decrees. Monsieur le Premier President, I forbid you to allow these
meetings, and any single one of you to demand them.” 33 The function of
the Parlement</p>
<p>The place of the nobles in the government was radically changed. They
furnished the dress and glamour of the court and the army, but they
seldom held administrative posts. The leading nobles’ were invited to
leave their estates through most of the year and live at the court —
most of them in their Paris hotels, or mansions, the greater of them in
the royal palaces as royal guests; hence the acres of apartments at
Versailles. If they refused the invitation they could expect no favors
from the King. The nobles were exempt from taxation, but they were
required, in time of crisis, to rush back to their rural chateaux,
organize and equip their retainers, and lead them to join the army. The
tedium of court life made them relish war. They were expensive idlers,
but their bravery in battle became a compulsion of their caste. Custom
and etiquette forbade them to engage</p>
<p>The Notes pour servir aux Memoir es, begun in 1661, were continued at
intervals till 1679, when he added Reflexions sur le metier de roi —
Thoughts on the Business of Being a King. Despite their theory of
absolutism they contain much good sense, and make the treatises of
philosophers on this subject seem jejune. They were apparently dictated
to secretaries, who tidied them up into literary form. They are as well
worth reading as anything in the literature of the age.</p>
<p>1 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>in commerce or finance — though they took tolls on trade passing
through their lands, and borrowed freely from the bankers. Their estates
were worked by sharecroppers {metayers), who paid them a part of the
pro- duce and rendered them various feudal services and dues. The
seigneur was expected to maintain local order, justice, and charity; in
some locali- ties he did this reasonably well, and was respected by the
peasants; in others he gave a poor return for his privileges, and his
long absences at court undermined the humanizing intimacy of master and
man. Louis for- bade the private wars of feudal factions, and put an
end, for a time, to dueling, which had revived during the Fronde — and
had become doubly serious, since seconds as well as principals fought
and killed, and cheated Mars of prey. Gramont reckoned nine hundred
deaths from dueling in nine years (1643-5 2). 34 Perhaps one cause of
the frequent wars was the desire to provide an outlet, at the expense of
foreigners, for domestic pugnacity and pride.</p>
<p>For the actual operation of the government Louis preferred those
leaders of the middle class who had proved their ability by their rise,
and could be depended upon to support the absolutism of the King. 35
Administra- tion was directed chiefly by three councils, each meeting
under the King’s presidency, and serving to prepare the information and
recommendations upon which he based his decisions. A Conseil d’£tat of
four or five men met thrice weekly to deal with major questions of
action or policy; a Conseil des Depeches managed provincial affairs; and
a Conseil des Finances attended to taxation, revenue, and expenditure.
Additional councils dealt with war, commerce, religion. Local government
was taken out of the hands of irresponsible nobles and entrusted to
royal intendants, and munici- pal elections were manipulated to produce
mayors satisfactory to the King. Today we should consider so centralized
a government to be oppressive; it was, but probably less so than the
preceding rule by municipal oligarchies or feudal lords. When a royal
commission entered the Auvergne district (1665) to inquire into local
abuses of seignorial power, the people wel- comed this grand inquest
{les grands jours cT Auvergne) as their liberation from tyranny; they
were delighted to see a grand seigneur beheaded for murdering a peasant,
and lesser nobles punished for malfeasance or cruelty. 36 By such
procedures monarchical replaced feudal law.</p>
<p>The laws were revised into as much order and logic as comported with
aristocracy, and the Code Louis so formed (1667-73) governed France till
the Code Napoleon (1804-10). The new code was superior to any- thing of
the kind since Justinian, and it “powerfully contributed to ad - vance
French… civilization.” 37 A system of police was established to check
the crime and filth of Paris. Marc Rene, Marqui s de Voyer d’Argen -
son, serving through twenty-one years as lieutenant general of
police,</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>left a noble record for just and energetic administration of a
difficult post. Under his surveillance the streets of Paris were paved,
were moderately cleaned, were lighted by five thousand lamps, and were
made passably safe for the citizens; in such matters Paris was now far
ahead of any other city in Europe. But the code legalized much barbarism
and tyranny. A net of informers was spread through France, spying on
words as well as actions. Arbitrary arrests could be made by lettres de
cachet — secret orders of the king or his ministers. Prisoners could be
kept for years with- out trial, and without being told the cause of
their arrest. The code for- bade accusations of witchcraft, and it ended
capital punishment for blasphemy, but it retained the use of torture to
elicit confessions. A great variety of offenses could be punished by
condemnation to the war galleys — large, low ships rowed by convicts
chained to the benches. Six men were allotted to each fifteen-foot oar,
and were forced to hold a pace set by an overseer’s whistle. Their
bodies were naked except for a loincloth; tbeir hair, beards, and
eyebrows were shaved. Their sentences were long, and could be
arbitrarily extended for inadequate submission; sometimes they were kept
to their slavery for years after their sentences had expired. They knew
relief only when, in port, still coupled in chains, they could sell
trifles or beg for charity.</p>
<p>Louis himself was placed above the law, free to decree any punishment
for anything. In 1674 he decreed that all prostitutes found with
soldiers within five miles of Versailles should have their noses and
ears cut off. 88 He was often humane, but often severe. “A measure of
severity,” he told his son, “was the greatest kindness I could do to my
people; the opposite policy would have brought in an endless series of
evils. For as soon as a king weakens in that which he has commanded,
authority perishes, and with it the public peace…. Everything falls upon
the lowest ranks,</p>
<p>oppressed by thousands of petty tyrants, instead of by a legitimate
king.” 89</p>
<p>He labored conscientiously at what he called le metier de roi. He re-
quired frequent and detailed reports from his ministers, and was the
best- informed man in the kingdom. He did not resent ministerial advice
contrary to his own views, and sometimes yielded to his councilors. He
maintained the most friendly relations with his aides, provided that
they remembered who was king. “Continue to write to me whatever comes
into your mind,” he told Vauban, “and do not be discouraged though I do
not always do what you suggest.” 40 He kept an eye on everything — the
army, the navy, the courts, his household, the finances, the Church, the
drama, literature, the arts; and though, in this first half of his
reign, he was supported by devoted ministers of high ability, the major
policies and decisions, and the union of all phases of the complex
government into a consistent whole, were his. He was every hour a
king.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>It was hard work. He was waited on at every step, but paid for it
by</p>
<p>being watched in every move. His getting out of bed and getting into
it (when unaccompanied) were public functions. After his lever, or
official rising, he heard Mass, breakfasted, went to the council
chamber, emerged toward one o’clock, ate a big meal, usually at a single
small table, but surrounded by courtiers and servitors. Then, usually, a
walk in the garden, or a hunt, attended by the favorites of the day.
Returning, he spent three or four hours in council. From seven till ten
in the evening he joined the court in its amusements — music, cards,
billiards, flirtation, dancing, re- ceptions, balls. At several stages
in this daily routine “anyone spoke to him who wished,” 41 though few
took the liberty. “I gave my subjects, without distinction, the freedom
to address me at all hours, in person or by petition.” 42 About io p.m.
the King supped in state with his children and grandchildren, and,
sometimes, the Queen.</p>
<p>France was edified to note how punctually, seven or eight hours
six</p>
<p>days a week, the King attended to the tasks of government. “It is un
- believable,” wrote the Dutch ambassador, “with what promptness,
clarity, judgment, and intelligence this young prince treats and
expedites business, which he accompanies with a great agreeableness to
those with whom he deals, and with a great patience in listening to that
which one has to say to him: which wins all hearts.” 43 He continued his
devotion to ad - ministration through fifty-four years, even when ill in
bed. 44 He came to councils and conferences carefully prepared. He
“never decided on the</p>
<p>Despite or because of the concentration of authority and direction,

France, in those days of her ascendant sun, was better governed than
ever before.</p>

<li>NICOLAS FOUQUET: 1615-80</li>
</ol>
<p>The first task was to reorganize finance, which under Mazarin had</p>
<p>fallen through a sieve of embezzlements. Nicolas Fouquet, as
surintendant des finances since 1653, had managed taxation and
expenditure with sticky fingers and lordly hand. He had reduced the
hindrances to internal trade, and had stimulated the growth of French
commerce overseas; and he had</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>*9</p>
<p>dutif ully shared the spoils of his office with the “farmers” of the
taxes and with Mazarin. The “farmers - general” were capitalists who
advanced large sums to the state, and were in return, and for a fixed
sum, empowered to collect taxes. This they did with such efficient
rapacity that they were the most hated persons in the kingdom;
twenty-four such men were executed during the French Revolution. In
collusion with these fermiers-generaux Fouquet amassed the greatest
private fortune of his time.</p>
<p>In 1657 he engaged the architect Louis Le Vau, the painter
Charles</p>
<p>Le Brun, and the landscape artist Andre Le Notre to design, build,
and decorate the immense and magnificent Chateau Vaux-le-Vicomte, to lay
out the gardens and adorn them with statuary. The project employed
eighteen thousand men at one time, 47 cost eighteen million livres, 48
and covered the area of three villages. There Fouquet collected
paintings, sculpture, objects of art, and a library of 27,000 volumes,
impartially in- cluding Bibles, Talmuds, and Korans. To these elegant
rooms (we are told) “women of the highest nobility went secretly to keep
him company at an extravagant price.” 49 With similar taste but at less
cost he brought poets like Corneille, Moliere, and La Fontaine to grace
his salon.</p>
<p>Louis envied this splendor, and suspected its source. He asked
Colbert to examine the Surintendant’s methods and accounts; Colbert
reported that they were incredibly corrupt. On August 17, 1661, Fouquet
invited the young King to a fete at Vaux. The six thousand guests were
served</p>
<p>on six thousand plates of silver or gold; Moliere presented, in the
gardens, his comedy Les Fdcheux. That evening cost Fouquet 120,000
livres, and his liberty. Louis felt that t his man was “stealing beyond
his station.” He did not like the motto Quo non ascendam? — “To what may
I not ascend?” — accompanied by the figure of a squirrel climbing a
tree; and he thought that one of Le Brun’s paintings contained a
portrait of Mile, de La</p>
<p>Valliere, already a royal mistress. He would have arrested Fouquet on
the spot, but his mother convinced him that it would spoil an enchanting
evening.</p>
<p>The King bided his time until the evidence of the minister’s
peculations was overwhelming. On September 5 he ordered the chief of his
musketeers to arrest him. (This mousquetaire was Charles de Baatz, Sieur
d’Artagnan, hero of Dumas pere.) The trial, dragging on for three years,
became the cause most celebre in the history of the reign. Mme. de
Sevigne, La</p>
<p>Fontaine, and other friends worked and prayed for Fouquet’s
acquittal, but the papers found in his chateau convicted him. The court
condemned him to banishment and the confiscation of his property; the
King changed this to life imprisonment. For sixteen years the once
joyous minister languished in the fortress of Pignerol (Pinerolo) in
Piedmont, consoled by the faithful comradeship of his wife. It was a
harsh sentence, but it checked</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>political corruption, and served notice that the appropriation of
public funds for private pleasure was a prerogative of the king.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>COLBERT REBUILDS FRANCE</li>
</ol>
<p>“To keep an eye on Fouquet,” Louis wrote, “I associated with him</p>
<p>Colbert as… intendant, a man in whom I had all possible confidence,
for I knew his intelligence, application, and honesty.” 50 Fouquet’s
friends thought that Colbert had pursued him vindictively; some envy may
have been involved, but in all the France of that age no man rivaled
Colbert in tireless devotion to the public good. Mazarin, dying, is
reported to have said to the King, “Sire, I owe everything to you; but I
pay my debt… by giving you Colbert.” 51</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste Colbert was the son of a clothier in Reims, and the
nephew of a rich merchant. Bourgeois in blood and economist by
contagion, he was trained to hate confusion and incompetence, and was
fitted by nature and time to trarisform the economy of France from
peasant changelessness and feudal fragmentation into a nationally
unified system of agriculture, industry, commerce, and finance, marching
with a centralized monarchy, and providing it with the material basis of
grandeur and power.</p>
<p>Entering the war office as a minor secretary at the age of twenty
(1639), Colbert toiled his way into notice, was taken into the service
of Mazarin, and became the successful manager of the Cardinal’s fortune.
When Fouquet fell, Colbert was given the critical task of reorganizing
the nation’s finances. In 1664 he was made also superintendent of
buildings, royal manu- factures, commerce, and fine arts; in 1665 he was
named controller general of finances; in 1669, secretary of the navy,
and secretary of state for the King’s household. No other man under
Louis XIV rose so rapidly, worked so hard, or accomplished so much. He
sullied his rise with nepotism, dower- ing countless Colberts with place
and pay, and remunerated himself almost in proportion to his worth. He
was subject to vanity, insisting on his alleged descent from Scottish
kings. Sometimes, in his hurry to get things done, he rode roughly over
existing laws, and circumvented opposition with superior bribery. As his
power grew he became imperious, and angered the nobility by stepping on
toes that bled blue blood. In remolding the French economy he used the
same dictatorial methods that Richelieu had used in remolding the French
state. He was no better than a car- dinal.</p>
<p>He began by looking into the ways of the financiers who collected</p>
<p>axes, supplied the army with weapons, clothing, and food, and
advanced loans to feudal lords or the national treasury. Some of these
bankers were</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>as rich as kings; Samuel Bernard had 33,000,000 livres. 52 Many of
them infuriated the aristocracy by marrying into it, by buying or
earning titles, and by living in luxury unattainable by mere pedigree.
They charged up to eighteen per cent for their loans, according to the
uncertainty of re- payment. At Colbert’s request the King set up a
Chamber of Justice to inquire into all financial malfeasance since 1635
“by any person of any quality or condition whatsoever.” 53 All fiscal
agents, tax collectors and rentiers were summoned to open their records
and explain the legitimacy of their gains. Everyone had to show clean
hands or suffer confiscation and other penalties. The Chamber spread its
agents through France, and encouraged informers. Several men of wealth
were imprisoned, some were sent to the galleys, some were hanged. The
upper classes were shocked by this “Colbert Terror”; the lower classes
applauded. In Burgundy the money men organized a revolt against the
minister, but the populace rose in arms against them, and the government
was hard put to save them from the public wrath. Some 1 50,000,000
francs were restored to the treasury, and fear, for a generation,
tempered the corruptions of finance. 54</p>
<p>Colbert marched through the fisc with an economizing scythe. He dis-
missed half the officials in the department of finance. Probably at his
sug- gestion Louis abolished, in the royal household, all offices that
carried emoluments without duties. Twenty “secretaries to the king” were
sent out to earn their bread. The number of attorneys, sergeants,
ushers, and other minor functionaries at the court was drastically
reduced. All fiscal agents were ordered to keep and submit accurate and
intelligible accounts. Colbert converted old governmental debts into new
ones at a lower rate of interest. He simplified the collection of taxes.
Recognizing the diffi- culty of collecting arrears, he persuaded the
King to cancel all taxes still due for 1647-58. He lowered the tax rate
in 1661, and mourned when he had to raise it again in 1667 to finance
the “War of Devolution” and the extravagance of Versailles.</p>
<p>His greatest failure was in retaining the old system of taxation.
Perhaps a basic reconstruction would have entailed disorder endangering
the flow of revenue. The state was financed chiefly by two taxes — the
taille and the gabelle. In some provinces the taille (cut) was assessed
on real property, in others on income. The nobles and the clergy were
exempt from this tax, so that it fell entirely upon the “third estate” —
which was all the rest of the population. Each district was required to
collect a stated amount, and the principal citizens were held
responsible for raising the allotted sum. The gabelle was a tax on salt.
The government held a monopoly on its sale, and compelled all subjects
to buy periodically a prescribed quantity at prices fixed by the
government. To these basic taxes were added a variety of minor imposts,
and the tithe of the peasant’s produce to be paid to the Church.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>This, however, was usually much less than a tenth, 65 and was
collected with mercy.</p>
<p>Colbert’s reforms affected agriculture least. The technique of
tillage was still so primitive that it could not support twenty million
people reproducing without restraint. Many couples had twenty children;
the population would have doubled every twenty years except for war,
famine, disease, and infant mortality. 56 Yet Colbert, instead of
seeking to increase the fertility of the soil, gave tax exemptions for
early marriage, and rewards for large fam- ilies: a thousand livres to
parents of ten children, two thousand livres to parents of twelve. 57 He
protested the multiplication of convents as a threat to the manpower of
France. 53 Nevertheless the French birth rate declined during the reign,
as war raised taxes and deepened poverty. Even so, war did not kill
enough to keep a balance between births and food, and pestilence had to
co-operate with war. Two successive crop failures could bring fam- ine,
for transportation was not developed to the point of effectively supply-
ing the deficiencies of one region with the surplus of another. There
was no year without famine somewhere in France. 69 The years 1648-51,
1660- 62, 1693-94, an d 1709-10 were periods of starvation terror, when,
in some districts, thirty per cent of the population died. In 1662 the
King imported com, sold it at a low price or gave it to the poor, and
remitted three million francs of taxes due. 60</p>
<p>Legislation alleviated some rural griefs. The seizure of peasants’
beasts, carts, or implements for debt was forbidden, even for debts owed
the Crown; stud farms were established where the peasants might have
their mares serviced without charge; hunters were forbidden to traverse
sown fields; and fax exemptions were offered to those who restored
abandoned lands to cultivation. But these palliatives could not reach
the heart of the problem — the disbalance between human and soil
fertility, and the lack of mechanical invention. All the peasantries of
Europe suffered likewise, and the French pay sans were probably better
off than their fellows in England or Germany. 61</p>
<p>Colbert sacrificed agriculture to industry. To feed the rising
population of the towns, and the expanding armies of the King, he kept
the price of grain from rising commensurately with other staples. He
took it as ele- mentary that a government, to be strong, must have ample
revenues and an army of sturdy soldiers well equipped; a peasantry
inured to hardships would provide a tough infantry; a growing industry
and commerce must supply the wealth and the tools. Therefore Colbert’s
persisting aim was to stimulate industry. Even trade was to be
subordinate; home industries were to be protected by tariffs that would
exclude dangerous competition from abroad. Continuing the economic
policies of Sully and Richelieu, he brought all but the minor
enterprises of France under the control of the</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>corporative state: each industry, with its guilds, finances, masters,
appren- tices, and journeymen, formed a corporation regulated by the
government in practices, prices, wages, and sales. He established high
standards for each industry, hoping to win foreign markets by the
refinement of design and finish in French products. He and Louis
believed that the aristocratic taste for elegance supported and improved
the luxury trades; so the gold- smiths, engravers, cabinetmakers, and
tapestry weavers found employment, stimulus, and renown.</p>
<p>Colbert completely nationalized the Gobelin factory in Paris, and
made it a model of method and arrangement. He encouraged new enterprises
by tax exemptions, state loans, and lowering the interest rate to five
per cent. He allowed new industries a monopoly until they were well
established. Inducements were offered to foreign artisans to bring their
skills into France; Venetian glassworkers were settled at St.-Gobain;
ironworkers were brought in from Sweden; and a Dutch Protestant, assured
freedom of worship, and capital advanced by the state, established at
Abbeville the manufacture of fine cloth. By 1669 there were 44,000 looms
in France; Tours alone had 20,000 weavers. France planted its own
mulberry trees, and was already famous for its silks. As the armies of
Louis XIV grew, textile factories multiplied to clothe them. Under these
stimuli French in- dustries rapidly expanded. Many of them produced for
a national or an international market, and some reached a capitalistic
stage of investment, equipment, and management. The King fell in with
Colbert’s industrializ - ing mission; he visited workshops, allowed fine
products to be stamped with the royal arms, raised the social status of
the businessman, and en- nobled great entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The state encouraged or provided scientific and technical education.
Workshops in the Louvre, the Tuileries, Les Gobelins, and the naval
ship- yards became schools for apprentices. Anticipating Diderot’s
Encyclopedic, Colbert sponsored an encyclopedia of arts and crafts, and
an illustrated description of all known machinery. 62 The Academy of
Sciences published treatises on machines and mechanical arts; the
Journal des savants recorded new industrial techniques. Perrault,
building the eastern front of the Louvre, marveled at a machine that
raised a stone block weighing 100,000 kilos (1,100 tons). 63 Colbert,
however, opposed the introduction of machinery that would throw
employees out of work. 64</p>
<p>Burning with a passion for order and efficiency, he nationalized, and
expanded almost to suffocation, the regulation of industry by communes
or guilds. Hundreds of ordinances prescribed methods of manufacture, the
size, color, and quality of products, the hours and conditions of labor.
Boards were established in all town halls to check defects in the output
of local crafts and factories. Specimens of faulty workmanship were
publicly</p>
<p>24 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. I</p>
<p>exposed, with the name of the worker or manager attached. If the
offender repeated the offense, he was censured at a meeting of the
guild; if he offended a third time he was tied to a post for public
exhibition and dis- grace. 65 Every ablebodied male was put to work;
orphans were drafted from asylums into industry; beggars were taken from
the streets and placed in factories; and Colbert remarked happily to the
King that now even chil- dren could earn something in the shops.</p>
<p>Workers were subjected to an almost military discipline. Laziness,
in- competence, cursing, indecent conversation, disobedience,
drunkenness, frequentation of taverns, concubinage, irreverence in
church — all these were to be punished by the employer, sometimes by
flogging. Working hours were long — twelve or more, with interruptions
of thirty or forty minutes for meals. Wages were low, and were partly
paid in goods priced by the employer. Vauban calculated the average
daily wage of artisans in the large towns at twelve sous (thirty cents)
a day; however, a sou could buy a pound of bread. 66 The government cut
down the number of re- ligious feast days that exempted men from work;
thirty-eight such holydays remained, so that the people had ninety days
of rest in the year. 67 Strikes were outlawed, meetings of workers to
improve their conditions were for- bidden; at Rochefort some workers
were jailed for complaining that their wages were too low. The wealth of
the business class grew, the revenues of the state rose; the condition
of the workers was probably lower under Louis XIV than in the Middle
Ages. 68 France was disciplined in industry as well as in war.</p>
<p>And in commerce. Colbert, like nearly all statesmen of his time,
believed that the economy of a nation should produce the maximum of
wealth and self-sufficiency within the nation; and that, since gold and
silver were so valuable as mediums of exchange, commerce should be so
regulated as to secure for the nation a “favorable balance of trade” —
i.e., an excess of ex- ports over imports, and therefore an influx of
silver or gold. Only in this way could France, England, and the United
Provinces, which had no gold in their soil, procure their needs, and
supply their troops, in time of war. This was “mercantilism”; and though
some economists ridiculed it, there</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>return; and interest rates had to be low to tempt entrepreneurs to
borrow capital. The competitive nature of man, in the lawless jungle of
states, geared their nationalistic economies to the chances and needs of
war. Peace is war by other means.</p>
<p>Therefore the function of commerce, in the view of Colbert (and, in-
deed, of Sully, Richelieu, and Cromwell) was to export manufactured
articles in exchange for precious metal or raw materials. In 1664, and
again in 1667, he raised the duties on imports that threatened to
outsell in France the products of domestic industries considered
necessary in war; and when such imports persisted, he forbade them
completely. He laid heavy export dues upon vital materials, but reduced
the tax on the export of luxuries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he tried to free domestic commerce from internal tolls. He
found French trade clogged by provincial, municipal, and manorial
barriers and tariffs. Goods moving from Paris to the Channel, or from
Switzerland to Paris, paid tolls at sixteen points; from Orleans to
Nantes, at twenty- eight points. These dues may have had sense when,
because of difficulties of transport, and possibilities of feudal or
intercommunal strife, each locality aspired to self-sufficiency, and
strove to protect its own industries. Now that France was politically
unified, these internal tolls were an irri- tating impediment to a
national economy. By an edict of 1664 Colbert tried to suppress all
internal tolls. The resistance was obdurate; in half of France the tolls
continued, some of them till the Revolution, of which they were a minor
cause. Colbert almost nullified his work for commercial expansion by
issuing complex regulations that aimed to remedy abuses but hampered
trade sometimes to frustration. “Liberty,” he (or one of his critics)
said, “is the soul of commerce. We must let men choose the most
convenient ways” (11 faut laissez faire les hommes ); 69 here was a
phrase destined to make history.</p>
<p>He labored to open new avenues of internal transport. He began a
system of royal highways, military in their primary purpose, but also a
boon to commerce in general. Land travel was still arduous and slow;
Mme. de Sevigne took eight days to go by coach from Paris to her estate
at Vitre in Brittany. At the suggestion of Pierre Paul de Riquet,
Colbert put twelve thousand men to work digging the great Languedoc
Canal, 162 miles long, and rising at times to 830 feet above sea level;
by 1681 the Mediterranean was connected by the Rhone, the canal, and the
Garonne with the Bay of Biscay, and the commerce of France could bypass
Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>Colbert envied the Dutch, who had fifteen thousand of the twenty</p>
<p>housand commercial vessels on the seas, while France had only six
hundred. He built up the French navy from its twenty ships to 270; he
repaired harbors and docks; he impressed men ruthlessly into naval
service; he organized or reformed trading companies for the West Indies,
the East</p>
<p>2 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Indies, the Levant, and the northern seas. He gave these companies
pro- tective privileges, but again the regulations that he laid upon
them hindered them fatally. Nevertheless foreign commerce grew; French
goods com- peted with Dutch or English products in the Caribbean and the
Near, Middle, and Far East. Marseilles, which had declined through lack
of French shipping, became the biggest port on the Mediterranean. After
ten years of experience, consultation and labor, Colbert issued (1681) a
mari- time code for French shipping and commerce; soon other nations
adopted it. He organized insurance for commercial ventures overseas. He
sanctioned French participation in the slave trade, but strove to
mitigate it with humane regulations. 70</p>
<p>He encouraged exploration and the establishment of colonies, hoping
to sell them manufactured articles for raw materials, and to use them as
feeders to a merchant marine that would prove useful in war. French
colonists were already spreading in Canada, West Africa, and the West
Indies, and were entering Madagascar, India, and Ceylon. Courcelle and
Frontenac explored the Great Lakes (1671-73). Cadillac founded a large
French colony at what is now Detroit. La Salle (having been granted a
monopoly in the slave trade in any regions that he should open up)
discovered the Mississippi (1672), and descended it in a frail bark,
reaching the Gulf of Mexico after two months of adventurous navigation.
He took possession of the delta, and named it after the King. France now
controlled the valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi through
the heart of North America.</p>
<p>All in all — and we have noted as yet but a part of Colbert’s
activity, having said nothing of his work for science, literature, and
art — this was one of the most devoted and overspreading lives in
history. Not since Charlemagne had a single mind so remade in so many
phases so great a state. Those regulations were a nuisance, and made
Colbert unpopular, but they created the economic form of modern France;
and Napoleon only con- tinued and revised Colbert in government and
code. For ten years France knew such prosperity as never before. Then
the faults of the system and the King brought it down. Colbert protested
against the extravagance of King and court, and the disease of war that
was consuming France in his old age; yet it was his high tariffs, as
well as Louis’ love of power and glory, that led to some of those wa rs;
France’s commercial rivals denounced the closing of her pdrts to their
goods. The peasants and the artisans bore the brunt of Colbert’s
reforms, and even the businessmen whom they en - riched charged that his
regulations clogged development; said one of them to the minister, “You
found the carriage overturned on one side, and you have upset it on the
other.” 71 When, broken and defeated, he died (Sep - tember 6, 1683),
his body had to be buried by night lest it be insulted by the people in
the streets. 72</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>V. MANNERS AND MORALS</p>
<p>It was an age of strict manners and loose morals. Dress was the
sacra- ment of status. In the middle classes clothing was almost
puritanically simple — a black coat modestly covering shirt and trousers
and legs. But in the elite it was magnificent, and more so in men than
in women. Hats were large and soft, with a broad brim trimmed with gold
braid, tilted up on one or three sides, and sporting a plume of feathers
caught in a metal clasp. When Louis came to the throne he — and soon the
court — discarded the perukes that had come into style with his bald
father, for the young King’s waves of chestnut hair were too splendid to
be concealed; but when, after 1670, his hair began to thin, he took to
wigs; and presently every head of any pretensions, in France, England,
or Germany, was crowned with bor- rowed and powdered curls falling to
the shoulders or lower, and making all men look alike except to their
bedfellows. Beards were shaved, mustaches were cherished. Gloves were
gauntleted and adorned, and both sexes carried muffs on cold days. The
high ruff was now replaced by the silk cravat, loosely tied around the
neck. The doublet was giving way to a long and ornamented vest; the
thighs were graced with culottes — trousers ending at the knees, and
buckled or ribboned there; and these garments were covered, except in
front, by a swirling coat whose sleeves ended in large cuffs trimmed
with lace. By law only nobles were permitted to deck their rai- ment
with gold embroidery or precious stones, but moneyed men of any class
overrode the law. Stockings were usually of silk. Male feet were shod in
boots, even for a dance.</p>
<p>The dress of courtly women was free and flowing to accord with their
morals. Their bodices were laced, but in front, as Panurge had urged in
Rabelais, and swelling bosoms leaped to the roving eye. Farthingales and
puffed sleeves went out with Richelieu. Robes were richly embroidered
and gaily colored; entrancing high-heeled shoes covered tired feet; and
hair was daintily beribboned, be jeweled, perfumed, and curled. The
first fashion magazine appeared in 1672.</p>
<p>Manners were stately, though under the flourish of the saluting hat
and trailing skirt many crudities remained. Men spat on floors, and
urinated on the stairways of the Louvre. 73 Humor could be brutal or
obscene. But conversation was elegant and polite, even when dealing with
physiology and sex. Men were learning from women the graces of conduct
and speech; they spoke clearly and correctly, avoided sententiousness
and pedantry, and touched all topics, however profound, with a light
gaiety of spirit and phrase. To dispute earnestly was bad form. Table
manners were improving. The King ate with his fingers to the end of his
life, but by that time forks</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>were in general use. About 1 660 napkins came into vogue, and guests
were no longer expected to wipe their fingers on the tablecloth.</p>
<p>Social morality was not outstanding in this age of etiquette and
protocol. Charity declined as the wealth of the upper classes grew.
Morals</p>
<p>were soundest in the lower middle class, where good behavior was</p>
<p>made possible by security, and stimulated by the desire to rise. In
all classes the ideal was I’honnete homrne — not the honest man, but the
honor- able man, who added good breeding and manners to good conduct.
Honesty was hardly expected. Despite Colbert’s regulations and royal
espionage, venality in office was widespread, and it was encouraged by
the sale of governmental appointments as a source of public revenue.
Crime sprouted from the greed of the rich, the need of the poor, and the
passionate out- breaks of all classes. So some highborn dames enjoyed
the services of Catherine Monvoisin or the Marquise de Brinvilliers,
both skilled in con- cocting poisons of lingering subtlety; poisoning
was so popular that special courts were set up to deal with it. 74
Catherine Montvoisin practiced medi- cine, midwifery, and witchcraft;
she assisted a renegade priest in celebrat- ing the “Black Mass,”
soliciting the aid of Satan; she procured abortion and sold poisons and
love potions. Among her clients were Olympe Mancini, niece of Mazarin,
the Comtesse de Gramont, and Mme. de Montespan, mistress of the King. In
1679 a commission investigated the activities of “La Voisin,” and found
evide nce involving so many members high at the court that Louis ordered
suppression of the record. 75 La Voisin was burned alive (1680).</p>
<p>Private morals included the usual aberrations. In law homosexuality
was punishable with death; a nation preparing for war and paying for
babies could not let the sexual instincts be diverted from reproduction;
but it was difficult to pursue such deviates when the King’s own brother
was a noted invert, beneath contempt but above the law. Love between the
sexes was accepted as a romantic relief from marriage, but not as a
reason for mar- riage; the acquisition, protection, or transmission of
property was judged more important in marriage than the attempt to fix
for a lifetime tbe pas- sions of a day. As most marriages in the
aristocracy were arrangements of property, French society condoned
concubinage; nearly every man who could afford it had a mistress; men
plumed themselves on their liaisons almost as much as on their battles;
a woman felt desolate if no man but her husband pursued her; and some
faithless husbands winked at their wives’ infidelities. “Is there in all
the world,” asks a character in Moli£re, “another town where the
husbands are as patient as here?” 76 It was in t his cynical atmosphere
that La Rochefoucauld’s maxims grew. Prostitution was de - spised if it
had no manners, but a woman like Ninon de Lenclos, who gilded it with
literature and wit, could become almost as famous as the King.</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Her father was a nobleman, freethinker and duelist. Her mother was a
woman of strict morals but (if we may believe her daughter) “with no
sensory feelings… She procreated three children, scarcely noticing it.”
77 Without formal education, Ninon picked up considerable knowledge; she
learned to speak Italian and Spanish, perhaps as aids in international
com- merce; she read Montaigne, Charron, even Descartes, and followed
her father into skepticism. Later her discussions of religion made Mme.
de Sevigne shudder. 78 “If a man needs a religion to conduct himself
properly in this world,” said Ninon, “it is a sign that he has either a
limited mind or a corrupt heart.” 79 She mig ht thence have concluded to
the almost universal necessity of religion; instead she slipped into
prostitution at the age of fifteen (1635). “Love,” she said recklessly,
“is a passion involving no moral obligation.” 80 When Ninon allowed her
promiscuity to be too prominent, Anne of Austria ordered her confinement
in a convent; there, we are told, she charmed the nuns by her wit and
vivacity, and enjoyed her imprison- ment as a restful vacation. In 1657
she was released by order of the King.</p>
<p>There was so much more in her than the courtesan that she soon
enlisted among her devotees many of the most distinguished men in
France, includ- ing several members of the court, 81 ranging from the
composer Lully to the Great Conde himself. She played the harpsichord
well, and sang; Lully came to her to try out his new airs. Three
generations of Sevignes were on her list — the husband, then the son,
then the grandson, of the amiable letter writer. 82 Men came from
foreign lands to court her. Her lovers, she said, “never quarreled over
me; they had confidence in my inconsistency; each awaited his turn.”
83</p>
<p>In 1657 she opened a salon; she invited men of letters, music, art,
politics, or war, and sometimes their wives; and she astonished Paris by
showing an intelligence equal to that of any woman, and most men, of her
time; behind the face of Venus they found the mind of Minerva. Says a
severe judge, Saint-Simon:</p>
<p>It was useful to be received by her, on account of the
connections</p>
<p>hus formed. There was never any gambling there, nor loud laughing,
nor disputes, nor talk about religion or politics, but much elegant</p>
<p>wit… [and] news of gallantries, yet without scandal. All was</p>
<p>delicate, light, measured; and she herself maintained the
conversation by her wit and her great knowledge. 84</p>
<p>At last the King himself became curious about her; he asked Mme. de
Maintenon to invite her to the palace; from behind a curtain he listened
to her; charmed, he revealed and introduced himself. But by this time
(1677?) s he had become quasi-respectable. Her simple honesty and many
kindnesses gave her a brighter renown; men left large sums with her
for</p>
<p>3 &lt;&gt;</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>safekeeping, and could always rely on regaining them at will; and
Paris had noted how, when the poet Scarron was incapacitated by
paralysis, Ninon visited him almost daily, bringing him the delicacies
that he could not afford.</p>
<p>She outlived nearly all her friends, even the nonagenarian
Saint-£vre- mond, whose letters from England were the consolation of her
old age. “Sometimes,” she wrote to him, “I am tired of always doing the
same things, and 1 admire the Swiss who throw themselves into the river
for that very reason.” 85 She resented wrinkles. “If God had to give a
woman wrinkles, He might at least have put them on the soles of her
feet.” 86 As she neared death, in her eighty-fifth year, the Jesuits
competed.with the Jansenists for the honor of converting her; she
yielded to them graciously, and died in the arms of the Church (1705).
87 In her will she left only ten ecus for her funeral, “so that it might
be as simple as possible”; but “I humbly request M. Arouet” — her
attorney — “to allow me to leave his son, who is at the Jesuits, one
thousand francs for books.” 88 The son bought books, read them, and
became Voltaire.</p>
<p>It was the crowning charm of French society that the sexual stimulus
extended to the mind, that the women were roused to add intelligence to
beauty, and that the men were tamed by the women to courteous conduct,
good taste, and polished speech; in this regard the century from 1660 to
1760 in France marks the zenith of civilization. In that society
intelligent women were numerous beyond any precedent; and if they were
also attrac- tive in face or figure, or in the solicitude of kindliness,
they became a per- vasive civilizing force. The salons were training men
to be sensitive to feminine refinement, and women to be responsive to
masculine intellect. In those gatherings the art of conversation was
developed to an excellence never known before or since — the art of
exchanging ideas without exag- geration or animosity, but with courtesy,
tolerance, clarity, vivacity, and grace. Perhaps the art was more nearly
perfect under Louis XIV than in the days of Voltaire — not so brilliant
and witty, but more substantial and friendly. “After dinner,” wrote Mme.
de Sevigne to her daughter, “we went to talk in the most agreeable woods
in the world; we were there till six o’clock, engaged in various sorts
of conversation so kind, so tender, so amiable, so obliging… that I am
touched to the heart by it.” 89 Many men ascribed nine tenths of their
education to such converse and social inter- course. 90</p>
<p>In the Blue Room at the Hotel de Rambouillet the first of the salons
was in its final glory. Conde came there, though he did not shine;
Corneille came, La Rochefoucauld, Mmes. de La Fayette and de Sevigne,
the Duchesse de Longueville, and La Grande Mademoiselle. There les
femmes precieuses laid down the laws of nice conduct and polished
speech. The Fronde inter- rupted these gatherings; Mme. de Rambouillet
moved to the country; and</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE SUN RISES 31</p>
<p>hough her hotel later reopened its doors to the genius of France, the
premiere of Moliere’s Les Precieuses ridicules (1659) was a mortal blow.
The first famous salon ended with the death of its founder in 1665.</p>
<p>Other salons continued the tradition, in the homes of Mmes. de La</p>
<p>Sabliere, de Lambert, and de Scudery — the last the most famous
novelist of the reign, the first a woman who attracted men by beauty
despite her love of physics, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. In
such salons flourished the femmes savantes who provoked Moliere’s
laughter in 1672.</p>
<p>But every satire is a half-truth; in his philosophical moments
Moliere might have recognized the right of women to share in the
intellectual life of their times. It is the women of France, even more
than her writers and artists, who are the crown of her civilization, and
the special glory of her history.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE COURT</li>
</ol>
<p>The King and the court helped to civilize France. The court, in
1664,</p>
<p>comprised some six hundred persons: the royal family, the higher
nobility, the foreign envoys, and the servant staff. In the fullness of
Versailles it grew to ten thousand souls, 91 but this included notables
in occasional attend- ance, all the entertainers and servitors, and the
artists and authors whom the King had singled out for reward. To be
invited to the court became a passion only third to hunger and sex; even
to be there for a day was a memorable ecstasy, worth half a lifetime’s
savings.</p>
<p>The splendor of the court lay partly in the luxurious furnishings of
the apartments, partly in the dress of the courtiers, partly in the
sumptuous entertainments, partly in the fame of the men and the beauty
of the women drawn there by the magnets of money, reputation, and power.
Some notable women, like Mmes. de Sevigne and de La Fayette, were seldom
seen there, for they had sided with the Fronde; but enough remained to
please a King extremely sensitive to feminine charms. In the portraits
that have come down to us these ladies seem a bit ponderous, overflowing
their corsages; but apparently the men of that time liked an adipose
warmth in their amours.</p>
<p>The morals of the court were decorous adultery, extravagance in dress
and gambling, and passionate intrigues for prestige and place, all
carried on a rhythm of external refinement, elegant manners, and
compulsory gaiety. The King set the fashion of costly dress, especially
in ambassadorial receptions; so in receiving the envoys of Siam he wore
a robe laced with gold and bordered with diamonds, the whole worth
12,500,000 livres; 92 such display was part of the psychology of
government. Nobles and their ladies consumed half the income of their
estates on clothing, lackeys, and equipage; the most modest had to have
eleven servants and two coaches;</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>richer dignitaries had seventy-five attendants in their household,
and forty horses in their stables. 93 When adultery was no longer
prohibited it lost its charm, and gambling at cards became the chief
recreation of the court. Louis again gave the lead, bidding for high
stakes, urged on by his mistress Montespan, who herself lost and won
four million francs in one night’s play. 9 4 The mania spread from the
court to the people. “Thousands ruin themselves in gambling,” wrote La
Bruyere; “a frightful game… in</p>
<p>which the player contemplates the total ruin of his adversary, and is
trans- ported with the lust for gain.” 95</p>
<p>Competition for the royal favor, for a lucrative appointment or a
place in the royal bed, led to an atmosphere of mutual suspicion,
calumny, and tense rivalry. “Every time I fill a vacant post,” said
Louis, “I make a hundred people discontented, and one ungrateful.” 96
There were quarrels for prece - dence at table or in attending the King;
even Saint-Simon worried lest the Due de Luxembourg should walk five
steps in advance of him in a proces- sion, and Louis had to banish three
dukes from court because they refused to yield precedence to foreign
princes. The King laid great stress on proto- col, and frowned when, at
dinner, he found an untitled lady seated above a duchess. 97 Doubtless
some fixed order was necessary to keep six hundred beribboned egos from
trampling upon one another’s toes, and visitors praised the external
harmony of the enormous entourage. From the palaces, receptions, and
entertainments of the King a code of etiquette, standards of manners and
taste, spread through the upper and middle classes, and became a part of
the European heritage.</p>
<p>To keep all these lords and ladies from being bored into regicide,
artists of every kind were engaged to arrange amusements — tournaments,
hunts, tennis, billiards, bathing or boating parties, dinners, dances,
balls, masques, ballets, operas, concerts, plays. Versailles seemed
heaven on earth when the King led the court into boats on the canal, and
voices and instruments made music, and torches helped the moon and the
stars to illuminate the scene. And what could be more splendid or more
suffocating than the formal balls, when the Galerie des Glaces reflected
in its massive mirrors the grace and sparkle of men and women in stately
dances under a thousand lights? To celebrate the birth of the Dauphin
(1662) the King arranged a ballet in the square before the Tuileries,
attended by fifteen thousand people. The Commune of 1871 destroyed the
palace, but the site of that famous fete is still called the Place du
Carrousel.</p>
<p>Louis loved dancing, praised it as “one of the most excellent and
impor - tant disciplines for training the body,” 98 and established at
Paris (1661) the Academie Royale de Danse. He himself took part in
ballets, and the</p>
<p>nobility followed suit. The composers at his court were kept busy
prepar- ing music for dances and ballets; there the dance suite
developed which was</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>so skillfully used by Purcell in England and the Bachs in Germany.
Not since Imperial Rome had the dance reached such graceful and
harmonious forms.</p>
<p>In 1645 Mazarin imported Italian singers to establish opera in Paris.
The Cardinal’s death interrupted this initiation, but when the King grew
up he founded an Academie de l’Opera (1669), and commissi oned Pierre
Perrin to present operas in several cities of France, beginning with
Paris in 1671. When Perrin bankrupted himself through excessive outlays
for scenery and machinery, Louis transferred the privilege des academies
de musique to Jean Baptiste Lully, who soon made the whole court dance
to his tunes.</p>
<p>He too was a gift of Italy. The Chevalier de Guise brought him, as
a</p>
<p>peasant boy of seven, from Florence to France in 1646 “as a present”
to his niece, La Grande Mademoiselle, who gave him work as an assistant
in her kitchen (sousmarmiton ). He annoyed his fellow servants by
practicing the violin, but Mademoiselle recognized his talent, and
provided him with an instructor. Soon he was playing in the royal band
of twenty-four violins. Louis took a liking to him, and gave him a small
ensemble to conduct. Through this little string orchestra he learned to
conduct and to compose — dance music, songs, violin solos, cantatas,
church music, thirty ballet suites, twenty operas. He became friendly
with Moliere, collaborated with him in several ballets, and composed
divertissements for some of Moliere’s plays.</p>
<p>His success as a courtier rivaled his triumphs as a musician. In
1672, through Mme. de Montespan’s influence, he succeeded in acq uiring
a monopoly on opera in Paris. He found in Philippe Quinault a librettist
who was also a poet. Together they produced a succession of operas that
consti- tuted a revolution in French music. Not only did these
performances de- light the court at Versailles, they brought the elite
of Paris to the theater that had been built for Lully in the Rue
St.-Honore, and in such numbers that the street was blocked with
carriages, and patrons in many cases had to get out and walk, often
through mud, lest they miss Act One. Boileau frowned upon opera as an
enervating effeminacy,“ but the King granted a charter to the Academie
de Musique (1672), and authorized “gentlemen and ladies to sing at the
representations of the said Academy without dero- gation” to their rank.

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>One more name survives from the music of that lordly reign. The</p>
<p>Couperins were another case of heredity in art, contributing
composers to France for two centuries, and ruling from 1650 to 1826 the
great organ in the Church of St.- Gervais. Fran§ois Couperin “le Grand”
held that</p>
<p>post for forty- eight years; he was also organiste du roi in the
King’s chapel at Versailles, and was the most famous harpsichordist o f
the “great cen - tury.” His compositions for that instrument were
closely studied by Johann Sebastian Bach; and his treatise L’Art de
toucher le clavecin (the French name for the clavichord) influenced the
great German’s Das wohltempe - rirte Clavier. Was music in the Couperin
blood, or only in the Couperin home? Probably it is social, not
biological, heredity that makes civilization.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE king’s WOMEN</li>
</ol>
<p>Louis was not a rake. We must always remember, in the case of kings
even to our own century, that custom required them to sacrifice their
per- sonal preferences in order to contract marriages of some political
utility to the state. Consequently society — and often the Church —
winked an eye when a king sought the exhilaration of sex and the romance
of love outside the marriage bond. If Louis had had his way he would
have begun with a marriage of love. He was deeply moved by the beauty
and charm of Marie Mancini, a niece of Mazarin; he begged his mother and
the Cardinal to let him marry her (1658); Anne of Austria reproved him
for allowing passion to interfere with politics; and Mazarin regretfully
sent Marie off to marry a Colonna. Then for a year the subtle minister
pulled wires to get as Louis’ bride Maria Teresa, daughter of Philip IV.
What if, by some failure of the male line in the Spanish kings, this
Infanta should bring all Spain as her dowry to the King of France? So in
1660, with all the costly splendor that mesmerized the taxpayers, Louis
married Maria, both of them twenty-two years old.</p>
<p>Marie Therese was a proud woman, pious and virtuous; her example and
influence helped to improve the morals of the court, at least in her
entou- rage. But a severe discipline had made her somber and dull, and
her great appetite was amplifying her, just when the beauties of Paris
were ogling her handsome mate. She gave him six children, of whom only
one, the Dauphin, survived infancy.* It was her misfortune that in the
very year of</p>
<ul>
<li>Mme. de Montespan, who was a bit biased, related in her memoirs how
an African prince presented Mane with a Negro dwarf, and how Marie gave
birth to “a fine, healthy girl, black from head to toe.” The Queen
ascribed the color to being frightened by the dwarf during her
pregnancy. The Paris Gazette announced that the girl had died shortly
after birth, but apparently she survived, was brought up by a colored
family, and became a nun. 102</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>heir marriage Louis had discovered in his sister-in-law Henrietta
Anne all the charms of young womanhood.</p>
<p>Henrietta Anne was the daughter of England’s Charles I. Her mother,
Henrietta Maria (daughter of Henry IV of France), had shared with her
husband the tragedy of the Civil War. When the Parliament army ap-
proached Charles’s headquarters at Oxford, the English Queen fled to
Exeter, and there, so ill that she expected death, she gave birth ( 1
644) to “a lovely little princess.” Pursued by Parliamentary agents, the
ailing mother fled again, and made her way clandestinely to the coast,
where a Dutch vessel, narrowly escaping English guns, took her to
France. The child, left behind with Lady Anne Dalkeith, lived through
two years of concealment in England before she too could be safely
gotten across the Channel. Soon she had to experience the vicissitudes
of the Fronde; in January, 1649, she joined her mother and Anne of
Austria in the flight from barricaded Paris to St.-Germain. In that
month the news came — doubtless kept from her for a time — that her
father had been beheaded by the vic- torious Roundheads. After the
Fronde subsided, Princess Henrietta was brought up in comfort and piety
by her mother, and both lived to see Charles II restored to the English
throne (1660). A year later, aged sixteen, she married the brother of
Louis XIV, “Monsieur” Philippe Due d’Orleans, and became “Madame.”</p>
<p>Monsieur was a little round-bellied man on high-heeled shoes, who
loved feminine adornments and masculine forms; as brave as any knight in
battle, but as painted, perfumed, beribboned, and begemmed as the
vainest woman in this vainest land. It was a grief and a shame to
Henrietta that her husband preferred the company of the Chevaliers de
Lorraine and de Chatillon to her own. Almost everybody else fell in love
with her, not so much for her frail beauty — though she was considered
the fairest creature at the court 103 — as for her gentle and kindly
spirit, her almost childlike vivacity and gaiety, the fresh vernal
breeze that she brought wherever she went. Racine — one of the many
authors whom she inspired and helped — called her “the arbiter of all
that is beautiful.” 104</p>
<p>At first Louis XIV found her too weak and slender for his vigor
and</p>
<p>aste; but as he came to feel the douceur etlumiere, “sweetness and
light,” 106 of her character, he found increasing pleasure in her
presence, delighted to dance with her, frolic with her, plan games with
her, go walking in the park at Fontainebleau or boating on the canal
with her, until all Paris assumed that she had become his mistress, and
thought it a just revenge on the “King of Sodom.” 100 But probably Paris
misjudged. Louis l oved her this side of adultery, and she, who spent
her devotion in love for her brothers Charles and James, accepted the
King as another brother, and took it as her mission to bind all three in
alliance or amity.</p>
<p>3 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. I</p>
<p>In 1670, at Louis’ request, she crossed to England to persuade
Charles to join France against Holland, even to urge him to proclaim his
Catholic faith. Charles so promised in the secret Treaty of Dover (June
1, 1670), and Henrietta returned to France loaded with gifts and
victory. A few days after reaching her palace at St.-Cloud she fell
violently ill. She thought she had been poisoned, and so all Paris
believed. The King and his Queen hurried to her bedside, along with the
penitent Monsieur, and Conde, Turenne, Mme. de La Fayette, and
Mademoiselle de Montpensier; and Bossuet came to pray with her. At last,
on June 30, her suffering ended. A post-mortem examination revealed that
she had died not of poison but of peritonitis. 107 Louis gave her such a
funeral as was usually reserved for crowned heads, and over her remains
in St.-Denis Bossuet preached a funeral sermon that has reverberated
through the centuries.</p>
<p>It was Henrietta who gave the King the first of his more public
mistresses. Bom at Tours in 1644, Louise de La Valliere received with
unquestioning faith the religious education given her by her mother and
her priestly uncle, the future bishop of Nantes. She had barely reached
the age of First Communion when her father died. Her mother remarried;
the new</p>
<p>husband, maitre d’hotel for Gaston, Due d’Orleans, secured a place
for Louise as lady in waiting to the daughters of the Duke; and when,
after Gaston’s death, his nephew and successor Philippe marr ied, he
took Louise with him as a maid of honor to Henrietta (1661). In that
capacity she frequently saw the King. She was dazzled by his splendor,
power, and personal fascination. Like a hundred other women she fell in
love with him, but hardly dreamed of speaking to him.</p>
<p>Her beauty was more of character than of form. She was delicate in
health, limped a bit, and “had no bosom to speak of,” said a critic; and
she was alarmingly thin. But her frailty was itself a charm, for it
engendered in her a modesty and gentleness that disarmed even women.
Henrietta, to discourage the gossip that she herself was the royal
mistress, had the King’s attention drawn to Louise. The scheme worked
too well; Louis was at- tracted by this timid girl of seventeen, so
different from the proud and aggressive ladies who surrounded him at the
court. One day, finding her alone in the gardens at Fontainebleau, he
offered himself to her, with no very honorable intentions. She surprised
him by confessing that she loved him, but she long resisted his
importunities. She pleaded with him not to make her betray both
Henrietta and the Queen. Nevertheless, by August, 1661, she was his
mistress. Everything seemed good if it was the King’s will.</p>
<p>Then the King in turn fell in love, and was never so happy as with
this diffident fledgling. They picnicked like children, danced at balls,
and pranced in ballets; by his side in the hunt she lost her timidity
and rode so impetuously that, said the Due d’Enghien, “not even the men
can keep up</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>with her.” 108 She took no advantage of her triumph; she refused to
accept</p>
<p>Sensing this mood, Louis gave her many signs of lingering affection,
and thought to keep her in his world by making her a duchess. But
between Montespan and war he found less and less time for her, and at
the court she cared for no one but him. In 1671 she renounced her
worldly possessions, put on the simplest dress she could find, slipped
out of the palace on a winter morning, and fled to the convent of
Ste.-Marie-de-Chaillot. Louis sent after her, protesting his love and
anguish; and she, still a maid in mind, consented to return to the
court. She stayed there three years more, torn between her love for the
faithless King and her longing for religious cleansing and peace;
already, in secret, she practiced in the palace the austerities of
conventual life. Finally she persuaded the King to release her. She
joined the barefoot Carmelite nuns in the Rue d’Enfer (1674), became
Sister Louise de la Misericorde, and lived there in ascetic penitence
for her remaining thirty- six years. “My soul is so content, so
tranquil,” she said, “that I worship the goodness of God.” 109</p>
<p>Her successor in the King’s favor has not won such universal
forgiveness. Fran§oise Athenai’s Rochechouart came to the court in 1661,
served the Queen as a maid of honor, and married the Marquis de
Montespan (1663). According to Voltaire she was one of the three most
beautiful women in France, and the other two were her sisters. 110 Her
pearl-studded blond curls, her languorous proud eyes, her sensuous lips
and laughing mouth, her caressing hands, her skin with the color and
texture of lilies — so her con- temporaries breathlessly described her,
and so Henri Gascard painted her in a famous portrait. She was pious,
she fasted strictly on fast days, and attended church devoutly and
frequently. She had a bad temper and a cutting wit, but that was at
first a challenge.</p>
<p>Michelet quoted her as having said she had come up to Paris resolved
to capture the King; 111 but Saint-Simon reports that when she saw that
she was quickening the royal pulse, she begged her husband to take her
back at once to Poitou. 112 He refused, confident of his hold on her,
and loving the aura of the court. One night at Compiegne she went to
sleep in a room usually assigned to the King. For a while he tried to
sleep in an adjoining room; he found it difficult; at last he took
possession of his room and her</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>(1667). The Marquis, hearing of it, put on widower’s garb, draped his
carriage in black, and adorned its corners with horns. Louis with his
own hand wrote the bill of divorcement between the Marquis and the
Marquise, sent him 100,000 ecus, and bade him leave Paris. The court,
quite shorn of morals, smiled.</p>
<p>For seventeen years Mme. de Montespan was mistress of the royal bed.
She gave Louis what La Valliere could not give him — intelligent con-
versation and stimulating vivacity. She boasted that she and dullness
could never be in the same place at the same time; and it was so. She
bore six children to the King. He loved them, and was grateful to her;
but he could not resist the opportunity to sleep, now and then, with
Mme. de Soubise or the young Mile, de Scorraille de Roussilles, whom he
made the Duchesse de Fontanges. Such aberrations led Mme. de Montespan
to consult sorceresses for magic potions or other means to keep the
King’s love; but the story that she planned to poison him or her rivals
was probably a legend spread by her enemies. 113</p>
<p>Her children were her undoing. She needed someone to take care of
them; Mme. Scarron was recommended, and was engaged; Louis, going fre-
quently to see his brood, observed that the governess was beautiful.
Mme. Scarrop, nee Frangoise d’ Aubigne, was the granddaughter of
Theodore Agrippa d’ Aubigne, Huguenot aide to Henry IV. Bom in a prison
at</p>
<p>Niort in Poitou, where her father was serving one of many sentences
for a variety of crimes, she was baptized a Catholic, and was brought up
amid the disorder and poverty of a divided family. Some Protestants took
pity on her, fed her, and made her so firm in the Reformed faith that
she turned her back upon Catholic altars. When she was nine her parents
took her to Martinique, where she nearly died under the harsh discipline
of her mother. The father dying a year later (1645), the widow and her
three children returned to France. In 1649 Frangoise, aged fourteen,
again a Catholic, was placed in a convent, and earned her bread with
menial tasks. Probably we should never have heard of her had she not
married Paul Scarron.</p>
<p>He was a famous writer, a brilliant wit, an almost complete
cripple,</p>
<p>hideously deformed. The son of a lawyer of note, he had expected a
prosperous career, but his widowed father married again, the new wife
rejected Paul, the father sent him off with a small pension, just enough
to entertain Marion Delorme and other ladies of a night. He contracted
syphilis, surrendered himself to a quack, and imbibed strong drugs that
ruined his nervous system. At last he was so paralyzed that he could
move hardly anything but his hands. He described himself:</p>
<p>Reader,… I am going to tell you as nearly as possible what I am</p>
<p>like. My figure was well made, though small. My malady has shortened
it by a good foot. My head is rather large for my body. My face is full,
while my body is that of a skeleton. My sight is fairly good, but my</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>eyes protrude, and one of them is lower than the other…. My legs and
thighs formed at first an obtuse, next a right, and finally an acute,
angle; my thighs and body form another; and with my head bent</p>
<p>down on my stomach I resemble not badly the letter Z. My arms</p>
<p>have shrunk as well as my legs, and my fingers as well as my
arms.</p>
<p>To sum up, I am a condensation of human misery. 114</p>
<p>He solaced his misery by writing a picaresque Roman comique ( 1 649)
, which had considerable success, and by staging farces hilarious in
their humor and scandalous in their wit. Paris honored him for keeping
his gaiety amid his pains; Mazarin and Anne of Austria gave him
pensions, which he forfeited by supporting the Fronde. He earned much,
spent more, and was repeatedly in debt. Propped up in a box from which
his head and arms emerged, he presided with zest and erudition over one
of the famous salons of Paris. As his debts multiplied, he made his
guests pay for their dinner. Still they came.</p>
<p>Who would marry such a man? In 1652 Frangoise d’Aubigne, now</p>
<p>sixteen, was living with a miserly female relative, who so grudged
her keep that she resolved to send Fran§oise back to a convent. A friend
introduced the girl to Scarron, who received her with painful grace. He
offered to pay her board and lodging in the convent, so exempting her
from taking the vows; she refused. Finally he proposed marriage to her,
making it clear that he could not claim a husband’s rights. She accepted
him, served him as nurse and secretary, and played hostess at his salon,
pretending not to hear the double-entendres of the guests. When she
joined in the conversation they were surprised by her intelligence. She
gave to Scarron’s gatherings a degree of respectability sufficient to
attract Mile, de Scudery, and, now and then, Mme. de Sevigne; Ninon,
Gramont, and Saint-£vremond were already habitues. There is a hint in
Ninon’s letters that Mme. Scarron</p>
<p>Celui qui ici maintenant dort</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>He left nothing but creditors. The “Widow Scarron,” still a young</p>
<p>woman of twenty-five, was again thrown destitute upon the world. She
appealed to the Queen Mother to renew the canceled pension; Anne settled
upon her two thousand livres annually. Frangoise took a room in a
convent, lived and dressed modestly, and accepted various minor employ-
ments in good homes. 117 In 1667 Mme. de Montespan, about to give birth,
sent an emissary to ask her to receive and bring up the expected child.
Frangoise refused, but when Louis himself seconded the request she con-
sented, and for several years thereafter she received the royal infants
as they emerged.</p>
<p>She learned to love these children, and they looked up to her as a
mother. The King, who at first had laughed at her as a prude, came to
admire her, and was moved by the grief she showed when one of the
children, despite her constant care, died. “She knows how to love,” he
said; “it would be a pleasure to be loved by her.” 118 In 1673 he
legitimized the children; Mme. Scarron had no longer to practice
secrecy; she was admitted to the court as a lady in waiting to Mme. de
Montespan. The King gave her a present of 200,000 livres to maintain her
new status. She used them to buy an estate at Maintenon, near Chartres.
She never lived there, but it gave her a new name; she became the
Marquise de Maintenon.</p>
<p>It was a dizzy rise for one so lately destitute, and perhaps it
turned her head for a time. She took upon herself to advise Mme. de
Montespan to end her life of sin; Montespan resented the counsel, and
thought that Maintenon was scheming to replace her. And indeed, by 1675,
Louis was becoming more impatient with Montespan’s tantrums, and was
finding pleasure in talking wi th the new Marquise. Perhaps with the
King’s con - nivance Bishop Bossuet warned him that the Easter Sacrament
would be refused him unless he dismissed his concubine. He bade her
leave the court. She did; Louis received Communion, and remained
continent for a while. Mme. de Maintenon approved his course, apparently
without selfish in- tent, 119 for soon she left with the sickly Due de
Maine (one of Montespan’s children) to seek the boy’s cure in the
sulphur baths of Bareges in the Pyrenees. Louis went off to the wars.
Returning famished, he repulsed Bossuet, and invited Montespan to
reoccupy her apartment in Versailles. There he fell into her waiting
arms, and she conceived again.</p>
<p>Maintenon, returning with the cured Duke from the Pyrenees, was</p>
<p>welcomed by the King and his mistress, but was alarmed to see him in
the full swing of several simultaneous liaisons. In 1679 he ended his
adulteries with Montespan by appointing her surintendante of the Queen’s
household — one of the many indelicacies to which he subjected Marie
Therese. Montespan raged and wept, but was comforted by great gifts. A
year later Maintenon received a similar post — lady of the bedchamber to
the</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>4 1</p>
<p>Dauphine, the wife of Louis’ one survi ving legitimate child. The
King now frequently visited the Dauphine, to converse with Maintenon.
There seems no doubt that he wished to make the Marquise his mistress,
and that she refused. On the contrary, she urged him to abandon his
irregularities and return penitent to the Queen. 120 He yielded to her
and Bossuet, and in 1681, after twenty years of philandering, he became
a model husband. The Queen, who had long since reconciled herself to his
infidelities, and even to his mistresses, enjoyed the royal favor for
only two years, dying in 1683.</p>
<p>Louis thought that Maintenon would now consent to be his mistress,
but he found in her a politic restraint: it must be marriage or nothing.
121 At some date not precisely known, but probably in 1684, he married
her, he forty-seven, she fifty. It was a morganatic union, whereby the
mate of lower status acquired no new rank, and no hereditary rights. The
King’s councilors had difficulty in dissuading him from giving his wife
full rights, and crowning her as queen; they pointed out how discontent
the royal family and the court would be to find themselves curtsying to
a governess. So the marriage was not made public, and there are some who
think it never took place. Saint- Simon, always a stickler for caste,
thought it “a frightful marriage”; 122 but it was the King’s best and
happiest union, the only one whose vows he appears to have kept. It had
taken him almost half a century to discover that to be loved is worth
monogamy.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>LE ROl S’EN VA -T-EN GUERRE</li>
</ol>
<p>The successes of Richelieu and Mazarin had left France the strongest
power in Europe. The Empire was weakened by the exhaustion and</p>
<p>division of Germany, and by renewed danger from the Turks. Spain was
weakened by the exhaustion of her gold and men in eighty years of futile
war in the Netherlands. England, after 1660, was bound to France by
secret subsidies to its King. France too had been divided and weakened,
but by 1667 the wounds of the Fronde had healed, and France was one.
Meanwhile first-rate men had been found to rebuild the French armies:
Louvois, a genius of military organization and discipline, Vauban, a
genius of fortification, trench warfare, and siege, and two superlative
generals — Conde and Turenne. Now, it seemed to the young and adulated
King, was the time for France to reach to her natural geographical
boundaries — the Rhine, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the sea.</p>
<p>First, then, to the Rhine. The Dutch controlled it; they must be
subdued; and soon thereafter they must be brought back to the faith that
for a thousand years had been the helpful ally of kings. Once the many
mouths of the great river were under French control, all the Rhineland,
and there-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>fore half of German commerce, would be in the power of France. The
Spanish Netherlands (“Belgium”) were in the way; they must be con -
quered. Philip IV, dying in 1665, left the Spanish Netherlands to
Charles II, his son by his second marriage. Louis saw a diplomatic
opening. He quoted the old custom of Hainaut and Brabant, by which the
children of a first marriage inherited in preference to those of a
second; Louis’ wi fe was the daughter of Philip IV’s first marriage;
therefore, by this ius devolutionis — the right or law of devolution or
transmission — the Spanish Netherlands belonged to Marie Therese. It was
true that Marie, at her marriage, had renounced her right of succession;
but this renunciation had been made conditional upon the payment of her
dowry — 500,000 gold crowns — by Spain to France; 123 this dowry had not
been paid; ergo… Spain denied the syllogism, Louis declared the “War of
Devolution.” Let his own memoirs reveal the motives of the royal chess
player:</p>
<p>The death of the King of Spain and the war of the English against</p>
<p>he Dutch (1 665) offered me at once two important occasions for</p>
<p>making war: one against Spain for the pursuance of rights which had
fallen to me; the other against England for the defense of the
Dutch.</p>
<p>I saw with pleasure the plan of these two wars as a vast field
where</p>
<p>great occasions might arise for distinguishing myself. Many brave</p>
<p>men whom I saw devoted to my service seemed always to be begging me
to offer them an opportunity for valor…. Moreover, since I was obliged
in any case to maintain a large army, it was more expedient for me to
throw it into the Low Countries than to feed it at my ex-</p>
<p>pense…. Under pretext of a war with England I would dispose</p>
<p>of my forces and my information [espionage] service to begin more</p>
<p>successfully my enterprise in Holland. 124</p>
<p>This was the royal view of war; it might make one’s country greater
in extent, security, or revenue; it would open roads to renown and
power; it would provide outlets for combative impulses; it would let the
costly army feed on alien food; it would improve the position of the
state for the next war. As for the human lives that would be lost, men
must die in any case; how absurd to die of some lingering disease in
bed! — how better could men die than in the anesthesia of battle, on the
field of glory, and for their fatherland?</p>
<p>On May 24, 1667, French troops crossed into the Spanish Netherlands.
There was no effectual resistance; the French had 55,000, the Spanish
8,000, men; soon the King entered Charleroi, Toumai, Courtrai, Douai,
Lille, as if in a triumphal procession; and Vauban fortified the
conquered towns. Louvois had supplies ready at every step, even to
silver service for the officers in camp or trench. Artois, Hainaut,
Walloon Flanders were</p>

<p>THE SUN RISES</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>annexed to France. Spain appealed to the Emperor Leopold I for help;
Louis proposed to Leopold to divide the Spanish empire with him; Leopold
agreed, and gave no help to Spain. The conquest of Flanders had been so
easy that Louis hurried to take also Franche-Comte — the region around
Besangon, between Burgundy and Switzerland. It was a dependency of
Spain, and yet a thorn in the very side of France. In February, 1668, a
French army, twenty thousand strong, descended upon Franche-Comte under
the lead of Conde; it was everywhere victorious, for French bribes had
softened local commanders. Louis himself led the siege of Dole; it fell
in four days; and in three weeks all Franche-Comte submitted. He
returned to Paris in glory.</p>
<p>But he had overreached himself. The United Provinces persuaded</p>
<p>Sweden and England to join them in a Triple Alliance against
France</p>
<p>(January, 1668); all three states recognized that their political or
com- mercial freedom would wither if the power of France should extend
to the Rhine. Louis saw that he had moved too precipitately toward his
goal. The secret agreement with Leopold had stipulated that on the death
of Charles II of Spain all the Netherlands and Franche-Comte were to go
to France; it seemed only a matter of a year or so when the sickly
Charles would die; perhaps it was better for France to wait and let the
fruit fall peacefully into her lap. Louis offered terms to the Alliance;
his trained diplomats worked on England and Sweden; at the Treaty of
Aix-la-</p>
<p>Chapelle (May 2, 1668) the War of Devolution was ended. France re-
turned Franche-Comte to Spain, but she retained Charleroi, Douai,
Tournai, Audenaarde, Lille, Armentieres, and Courtrai. Louis had kept
half the spoils.</p>
<p>In 1672 he resumed his march to the Rhine, and now his real goal ap-
peared — not Flanders but Holland. We shall see this tragedy later from
the standpoint of the Dutch; in summary, the attack reached almost to
Amsterdam and The Hague before it was checked by the opening of the
dykes. But again Europe rose against the new threat to the balance of
power. In October, 1672, Emperor Leopold joined the United Provinces and
Brandenburg in a “Great Coalition”; Spain and Lorraine entered it in
1673; Denmark, the Palatinate, and the duchy of Brunswick-Liineburg, in
1674; and in that year the English Parliament compelled its Francophile
King to make peace with the Dutch.</p>
<p>Louis faced bravely this nemesis of his pride. Despite Colbert’s com
- plaints that he was impoverishing France, he raised more taxes, built
a navy, and expanded his armies to 180,000 men. In June, 1674, he
directed one force to a second siege of Besangon; in six weeks
Franche-Comte was again conquered. Meanwhile Turenne, in the most
brilliant and ruthless of his campaigns, led twenty thousand soldiers to
victory over seventy</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>housand Imperial troops; to prevent the enemy from feeding itself, he
laid waste the Palatinate, Lorraine, and part of Alsace; along the Rhine
the desolation of the Thirty Years’ War was renewed. On July 27,
1675,</p>
<p>Turenne was killed while reconnoitering near Sulzbach in Baden. Louis
had him buried in St.-Denis with almost royal honors, knowing that that
one death equaled a dozen defeats. The Great Conde, after bloody
victories in the Netherlands, replaced Turenne, and drove the Imperials
from Alsace; then the Prince, worn out by years of passion and war,
retired to a life of philosophy and government at Chantilly. Louis now
took charge of the campaign in the Netherlands; he besieged and captured
Valenciennes, Cambrai, St.-Omer, Ghent, and Ypres (1677-78). France
acclaimed the King as a general.</p>
<p>But the drain upon his people had become unbearable. Revolts broke
out in Bordeaux and Brittany; in south France the peasantry neared
starva- tion; in the Dauphine the populace was living on bread made of
acorns and roots. 125 When the Dutch offered peace, Louis signed with
them (August 11, 1678) a treaty restoring to the United Provinces all
the territory that France had taken from them, and lowering the tariffs
that had kept Dutch products out of France. He made up for these
surrenders by forcing Spain, now in disintegration, to yield to him
Franche-Comte, and a dozen towns that advanced the northeastern frontier
of France into the Spanish Netherlands. A treaty with the Emperor kept
for France the strategic cities of Breisach and Freiburg-im-Breisgau;
Alsace and Lorraine re-</p>
<p>mained in French hands. These treaties of Nijmegen (1678-79) and St.-
Germain-en-Laye (1679) were a triumph for the United Provinces, but not
a defeat for Louis; he had prevailed over the Empire and Spain,</p>
<p>and, here and there, he had reached the coveted Rhine.</p>
<p>Despite the peace he kept up his immense army, knowing that an army
in being is a force in diplomacy. With that power behind him, and taking
scandalous advantage of the Emperor’s preoccupation with the advancing
Turks, he established in Alsace, Franche- Comte, and Breisgau “Chambers
of Reunion” to reclaim certain frontier districts that had formerly be -
longed to them; these were occupied by French troops; and the great city
of Strasbourg was induced, by the lavish lubrication of its officials,
to acknowledge Louis as its sovereign ( 1 68 1 ). In the same year, by
like means, the Duke of Milan was led to cede to France the town and
fortress of Casale, which controlled the road between Savoy and Milan.*
When Spain dallied in handing over the Netherland cities, Louis again

<ul>
<li>The Man in the Iron Mask was probably the Count Mattioli who sold to
Spain (1679) the secret of the negotiations between Louis and the Duke
of Milan. Speculation has identified him with a mysterious prisoner
Marchioli, whose face was hidden behind a velvet (not iron) mask, and
who died in the Bastille in 1703. 126</li>

<p>armies into Flanders and Brabant, overcame resistance with
indiscriminate bombardment, and absorbed the duchy of Luxembourg en
route (June,</p>
<p>1684). In the Truce of Regensburg (August 15) these conquests were
pro- visionally recognized by Spain and the Emperor, for the Turks
were</p>
<p>besieging Vienna. By an alliance with the Elector of Cologne Louis in
effect extended French power to the Rhine. Part of the Gallic aspiration
to reach natural boundaries was realized.</p>
<p>This was the zenith of the Roi Soleil. Not since Charlemagne had
France been so extended or so powerful. Immense and costly spectacles
celebrated the successes of the Sun King. The Council of Paris
officially declared him Louis le Grand (1680). Le Brun painted him as a
god on the vaults of Versailles; and a theologian argue d that Louis’
victories proved the existence of God. 127 The populace, amid its
destitution, idealized its ruler, and took pride in his apparent
invincibility. Even foreigners praised him, seeing some geographical
logic in his campaigns; the philosopher Leibniz hailed him as “that
great prince who is the acknowledged glory of our time, and for whom
succeeding ages will long in vain.” 128 North of the Alps and the
Pyrenees, west of the Vistula, all educated Europe began to speak his
language and imitate his court, his arts, and his ways. The sun was
high.</p>
