<h4 id="chapter-xvi-islam">CHAPTER XVI Islam</h4>
<p>1715-96</p>
<p>I. THE TURKS</p>
<p>I N the eighteenth century Christianity was caught between Voltaire
and Mohammed — between the Enlightenment and Islam. Though the Mos- lem
world had lost military power since Sobieski’s repulse of the Turks from
Vienna in 1683, it still dominated Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya,
Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Persia, Asia Minor, the Crimea, South
Russia, Bes- sarabia, Moldavia, Wallachia (Romania), Bulgaria, Serbia
(Yugoslavia), Montenegro, Bosnia, Dalmatia, Greece, Crete, the Aegean
Isles, and Tur- key. All these except Persia were part of the immense
empire of the Otto- manTurks. On the Dalmatian coast they touched the
Adriatic and faced the Papal States; on the Bosporus they controlled the
sole naval outlet from the Black Sea, and could at will block the
Russians from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Crossing from Hungarian territory into Moslem lands, one would at
first note little difference between Christian and Mohammedan
civilization. Here too the simple and pious poor tilled the soil under
the overlordship of the clever and skeptical rich. But beyond the
Bosporus the economic landscape changed: hardly fifteen per cent of the
terrain had come under cultivation; the rest was desert, or mountains
permitting only mining or pasturage; there the characteristic figure was
the Bedouin, black and parched with the sun, and wrapping himself
complexly against the sand and the heat. The coastal cities or
incidental towns hummed with trade and handicrafts, but life seemed more
leisurely than in Christian centers; women stayed at home, or walked in
stately dignity under their burdens and behind their veils, and the men
moved unhurried along the streets. Industry was nearly all manual, and
the craftsman’s shop was a frontal annex to his home; he smoked and
chatted as he worked, and sometimes shared his coffee ( qahvelo ) and
his pipe with a lingering customer.</p>
<p>By and large the common Turk was so satisfied with his civilization
that he had not for centuries tolerated any significant change. As in
Roman Catholic doctrine, tradition was as sacred as sacred scripture.
Religion was more powerful and pervasive in Islam than in Christendom;
the Koran was the law as well as the gospel, and the theologians were
the official interpreters of the law. The pilgrimage to Mecca annually
led its moving drama over the desert and along the dusty roads. But in
the upper classes the rationalist heresies voiced by the eighth-century
Mutazilites, and continued through the Age of Faith by Moslem poets and
philosophers, received a wide and secret assent. From Constantinople in
1719 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu reported:</p>
<p>4 1 1</p>
<p>4 12</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>The effendis (that is to say, the learned)… have no more faith in the
inspiration of Mohammed than in the infallibility of the pope. They make
a frank profession of deism among themselves, or to those they can
trust, and never speak of their law [the dictates of the Koran and the
traditions] but as a politic institution, fit now to be observed by wise
men, however at first intro- duced by politicians and enthusiasts. 1</p>
<p>The Sunni and Shi‘a sects divided Islam, as Catholicism and
Protestantism divided Western Christianity; and in the eighteenth
century a new sect was founded by Mohammad ibn-Abd-al-Wahab, a sheik of
the Nejd — that cen- tral plateau which we now know as Saudi Arabia. The
Wahabites were the Puritans of Islam: they condemned the worship of
saints, destroyed the tombs and shrines of saints and martyrs, denounced
the wearing of silk and the use of tobacco, and defended the right of
each individual to interpret the Koran for himself. 2 In all the sects
superstitions were popular; religious impostors and bogus miracles found
ready credence; and by most Moslems the realm of magic was considered as
real as the world of sand and sun. 3</p>
<p>Education was dominated by the clergy, who held that good citizens or
loyal tribesmen could be more surely made by disciplining character than
by liberating intellect. The clergy had won the battle against the
scientists, philosophers, and historians who had prospered in medieval
Islam; astronomy had relapsed into astrology, chemistry into alchemy,
medicine into magic, history into myth. But in many Moslems a wordless
wisdom took the place of education and erudition. As the wise and
eloquent Doughty wrote: “The Arabs and Turks, whose books are men’s
faces,… and whose glosses are the common saws and thousand old sapient
proverbs of their oriental world, touch near the truth of human things.
They are old men in policy in their youth, and have little later to
unlearn.” 4 Wortley Montagu, in a letter of 1717, assured Addison that
“the men of consideration among the Turks ap - pear in thei r
conversation as civilized as any I have met with in Italy.” 5 Wis - dom
has no nationality.</p>
<p>Poets have always abounded in Islam. The awesome deserts, the encom-
passing sky, and the infinity of stars on cloudless nights stirred the
imagina- tion, as well as religious faith, with the sense of mystery,
and the blood idealized with impeded desire the charms that women wisely
enhanced with concealment and modesty. In 1774 Sir William Jones, in
Commentaries on Arabic Poetry, revealed to alert minds in Western Europe
the popularity, elegance, and passion of poetry in Islam. Greatest of
Ottoman poets in the eighteenth century was Nedim, who sang in the time
of Sultan Ahmed III (1703-30):</p>
<p>Love distraught, my heart and soul are gone for naught,…</p>
<p>All my patience and endurance spent….</p>
<p>Once I bared her lovely bosom, whereupon did calm and peace</p>
<p>Forth from my breast take flight….</p>
<p>Paynim [pagan] mole, paynim tresses, paynim eyes,…</p>
<p>All her cruel beauty’s kingdom forms a heathenness , 1 swear.</p>
<p>Kisses on her neck and kisses on her bosom promised she.</p>
<p>Woe is me, for now the Paynim rues the troth she pledged
while-ere.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>ISLAM</p>
<p>4M</p>
<p>Such the winsome grace wherewith she showed her locks from ’neath her
fez;</p>
<p>Whatsoever wight beheld her, gazed bewildered then and there….</p>
<p>Ruthless, ’tis for thee that all men weep and wail in drear
despair….</p>
<p>Sweeter than all the perfumes, brighter than all dyes, thy dainty
frame;</p>
<p>One would deem some fragrant rose had in her bosom nurtured
thee….</p>
<p>Holding in one hand a rose, in one a cup, thou comest, sweet;</p>
<p>Ah, I know not which of these — rose, cup, or thee — to take to
me.</p>
<p>Lo, there springs a jetting fountain from the Stream of Life,
methought, When thou madest me that lovely lissom shape of thine to see.
6</p>
<p>Women had to take what advantage they could of their lissom shapes,
for once their lilies and roses faded they were lost in the recesses of
the harim. This term was applied not only to the wives and concubines of
the hus- band but to all the females of his household. Seclusion was
still their lot in the eighteenth century; they might go out, but (after
1754) they had then to veil all but their alluring eyes, and no male but
father, brother, husband and son might enter their apartment. Even after
death this separation of the sexes was supposed to remain: saved women
would have their own Elysium, apart from the men; saved men would go to
another Paradise, where they would be entertained by houris — heavenly
nymphs periodically revirginized. Adultery by women was severely
punished, and was rare; Arabs swore by “the honor of my women” as their
securest oath 7 Lady Mary reported that the Turkish women whom she had
been allowed to meet did not resent their separation from the men. Some
of them she thought as fair in face and figure, and as refined in
manners, as “our most celebrated English beauties.” 8 Admitted to one of
the many public baths, she discovered that women could be beautiful even
without clothing. She was especially charmed by the ladies in a bathing
establishment at Adrianople. They invited her to undress and bathe with
them; she begged to be excused. “They being all so earnest in persuading
me, I was at last forced to open my shirt and show them my stays; which
satisfied them very well, for I saw they believed I was so locked up in
that machine that it was not in my power to open it; which contrivance
they attributed to my husband”; and one of them remarked, “See how
cruelly the poor English ladies are used by their husbands.” 9</p>
<p>The Turks were proud of their public baths, and generally considered
themselves a more cleanly people than the Christian infidels. Many
persons in the upper and middle classes went to a “Turkish bath” twice a
week, more of them once a week. There they sat in a steam room until
they had sweated abundantly; then an attendant manipulated every joint,
massaged the flesh, rubbed it with a coarse cloth, washed it; we do not
hear much about arthritis in Turkey. Some other diseases flourished,
especially ophthal- mia; sand and flies infected the eyes. But the
Turks, as we have seen, taught Europe to inoculate for smallpox.</p>
<p>They had no doubt that their civilization excelled that of
Christendom. They admitted that slavery was more widespread in Islam,
but they saw no real difference between slaves in Turkey and serfs or
servants in the Chris- tian world, and Lady Mary and etymology agreed
with them. They were as zealous as we in the love and care of flowers;
they too, as in Constan-</p>
<p>414 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>inople under Ahmed III (1703-30), had feverish competitions in
cultivating tulips; apparently it was the Turks who, through Venice and
Vienna and the Netherlands, introduced to Christian Europe the tulip,
the Oriental hyacinth, and the garden ranunculus, as well as the
chestnut and mimosa trees. 10</p>
<p>Art in Turkey was now in decline, as in most Christian lands. The
Turks considered themselves superior in pottery, textiles, rugs,
decorations, even in architecture. They had inherited the art of
endowing abstract painting with logic, communication, and significance.
They gloried in the splendor of their faience (as on the Fountain of
Ahmed III in Constantinople), the un- fading gleam of their tiles, the
strength and delicacy of their weaves, the sturdy brilliance of their
rugs. Anatolia and the Caucasus were noted in this age for the lustrous
pile and strict geometrical design of their carpets, es- pecially of
their prayer rugs, whose columns and pointed arches kept the bent
worshiper facing the mihrab that indicated, in each mosque, the direc-
tion of Mecca. And the Turks preferred their domed and tiled and mina-
retted mosques to the spires and arches and gloomy grandeur of Gothic
cathedrals. Even in this declining age they raised the majestic mosques
of Nuri-Osmanieh (1748) and Laleli-Jamissi (1765), and Ahmed III brought
the style of the Alhambra to the palace that he built in 1729.
Constantinople, despite its tangled streets and noisome slums, was
probably the most impres- sive, as well as the largest, of European
capitals; its population of two mil- lion souls 11 was double that of
London, three times that of Paris, eight times that of Rome. 12 When
Lady Mary looked out upon the city and the port from the palace of the
British ambassador, she thought they constituted “perhaps, all together,
the most beautiful prospect in the world.” 13</p>
<p>Over this Ottoman Empire, from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, reigned
the sultans of the decline. We have considered elsewhere 14 the causes
of that decline: the movement of Asia-bound West-European commerce
around Africa by sea instead of overland through Egypt or western Asia;
the destruction or neglect of the irrigation canals; the expansion of
the em- pire to distances too great for effective central rule; the
consequent inde- pendence of the pashas and the separatism of the
provinces; the deterioration of the central government through
corruption, incompetence, and sloth; the repeated rebellions of
Janissaries repudiating the discipline that had made them strong; the
domination of life and thought by a fatalistic and unpro- gressive
religion; and the lassitude of sultans who preferred the arms of women
to those of war.</p>
<p>Ahmed III began his reign by allowing the Janissaries to dictate his
choice of a grand vizier. It was this vizier who, when he led 200,000
Turks against the 38,000 troops of Peter the Great at the River Prut,
accepted a bribe of 230,000 rubles to let the cornered Czar escape (July
21, 17 1 1). When Ven- ice incited the Montenegrins to revolt, Turkey
declared war against Venice (1715), and completed the conquest of Crete
and Greece. When Austria intervened, Turkey declared war against Austria
(1716); but Eugene of Savoy defeated the Turks at Peterwardein, and
compelled the Sultan, by the</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ISLAM</p>
<p>4*5</p>
<p>Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), to evacuate Hungary, to cede Belgrade
and parts of Wallachia to Austria, and to surrender to Venice certain
strong- holds in Albania and Dalmatia. An attempt to balance these
losses by raids on Persia brought more reverses; a mob led by a bath
attendant killed the Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, and forced Ahmed to abdicate
(1730).</p>
<p>His nephew, Mahmud I (r. 1730-54), renewed the struggle with the</p>
<p>West to determine by war the flow of taxes and the doctrines of
theology. One Turkish army took Ochakov and Kilburun from Russia,
another recov- ered Belgrade from Austria. But the military decline of
Turkey was resumed under Mustafa III (1757-74). In 1762 Bulgaria
declared itself independent. In 1769 Turkey opened war with Russia to
prevent the spread of Russian power in Poland; so began the long
conflict in which the armies of Catherine the Great inflicted fatal
repulses upon the Turks. After Mustafa’s death his brother Abdul-Hamid I
(1774-89) signed the humiliating Treaty of Ku- chuk Kainarji (1774),
which finished Turkish influence in Poland, South Russia, Moldavia, and
Wallachia, and Turkish control of the Black Sea. Abdul-Hamid renewed the
war in 1787, suffered disastrous routs, and died of grief. Turkey had to
wait for Kemal Pasha to end two centuries of chaos and make it a modern
state.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">

</ol>
<p>The Turks, after conquering Arabic Egypt (1517), delegated its
govern- ment to pashas and viceroys. The Mamelukes, who had ruled Egypt
since 1250, were allowed to retain local power as the beys of the twelve
sanjaks into which the country was divided. While the pashas lost their
vigor in luxury, the beys trained their soldiers to personal loyalty,
and soon chal- lenged the authority of the hated viceroys. The most
enterprising of these local rulers was ’Ali Bey, who in boyhood had been
sold as a slave. In 17 66 he deposed the pasha; in 1769 he declared
Egypt independent. Feverish with success, he led his Mameluke troops to
the conquest of Arabia, captured Mecca, and took the titles of Sultan of
Egypt and Khakan of the Two Seas (the Red and the Mediterranean). In
1771 he sent abu’l -Ahahab with thirty thousand men to co nquer Syria;
abu’l -Ahahab conquered, but then allied himself with the Porte, and led
his army back into Egypt. ’Ali fled to Acre, organized another army, met
the forces of abu’l -Ahahab and the Turks, fought till he was disabled
by wounds, was captured, and died within a week (1773). Egypt became
again a province of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Beneath such oscillations of power and ecstasies of homicide the
ships and caravans of trade, the industry of craftsmen, the annual
overflow of the Nile, and the labor of fellaheen in the fertile mud,
maintained in Egypt an econ- omy whose profits went to a minority
dowered by nature or circumstance with ability or place. The toil and
yield of fields and seas fed the cities — here, above all, Alexandria,
one of the greatest ports, and Cairo, one of the most populous capitals,
of the eighteenth-century world. The streets were narrow</p>
<p>4 16 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>o obstruct the sun, and were made picturesque by latticed windows and
balconies from which the women of the harem could look unseen upon the
life below. The larger streets hummed with handicrafts that defied
capitalis- tic intrusion or machine production. In Islam every industry
was an art, and the quality of the product took the place of quantity.
The poor made beau- tiful things for the rich, but they never sold their
pride.</p>
<p>Three hundred mosques supported the poor of Cairo with hope, and
adorned it with massive domes, shady porticos, and stately minarets. One
mosque, El Azhar, was also the mother university of Islam; to it came
two or three thousand students, from as far east as Malaysia and as far
west as Mo- rocco, to learn Koranic grammar, rhetoric, theology, ethics,
and law. The graduates of universities constituted the ulema, or body of
scholars, from whom were chosen the teachers and judges. It was a
regimen made for a rigorous orthodoxy in religion, morals, and
politics.</p>
<p>So morals hardly changed from century to century. Puberty came
earlier than in the north; many girls married at twelve or thirteen,
some at ten; to be unmarried at sixteen was a disgrace. Only the rich
could afford the polyg- amy that Koranic law allowed. A cuckolded
husband was not only per- mitted by law, but was encouraged by public
opinion, to put the offending wife to death. 15 Islamic theology, like
the Christian, considered woman a main source of evil, which could be
controlled only by her strict subordina- tion. Children grew up in the
discipline of the harem; they learned to love their mother and to fear
and honor their father; nearly all of them developed self-restraint and
courtesy. 16 Good manners prevailed in all classes, along with a certain
ease and grace of motion probably derived from the women, who may have
derived it from carrying burdens on their heads. The climate forbade
haste, and sanctioned indolence.</p>
<p>Polygamy did not prevent prostitution, for prostitutes could provide
the excitation that familiarity had allayed. The courtesans of Egypt
specialized in lascivious dances; some ancient monuments reveal the
antiquity of this lure. Every large town allotted to prostitutes a
special quarter where they might practice their arts without fear of the
law. As in all civilizations, women skilled in erotic dances were
engaged to vibrate before male assem- blies, and in some cases women
also took pleasure in witnessing such per- formances. 17</p>
<p>Music served both love and war; in either case it aroused attack and
soothed defeat. Professional musicians, of either sex, could be engaged
to provide entertainment. “I have heard the most celebrated musicians in
Cairo,” said Edward Lane in 1833, “and have been more charmed with their
songs… than with any other music that I have ever enjoyed.” 18 The fa -
vorite instrument was the kemengeh , a kind of emaciated viol, with two
strings of horsehair over a sounding box made of a cocoanut shell partly
cut open between center and top, and covered with fish skin tightly
stretched. The performer sat cross-legged, rested the pointed end of the
instrument upon the ground, and stroked the strings with a bow of
horsehair and ash. Or the artist sat with a large chanoon , or zither,
on his lap, and plucked the</p>

<p>ISLAM</p>
<p>4 X 7</p>
<p>strings with horn plectra attached to the forefingers. The ancient
lute now took the form of a guitar (the co’d). Add a flute, a mandolin,
and a tambou - rine, and the ensemble would provide an orchestra whose
strains might suit a civilized taste better than the primitive music
that now agitates Occidental gatherings.</p>
<p>The “Barbary States,” or lands of the allegedly barbarous Berbers—
Trip- oli, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco — entered history in the eighteenth
century chiefly through the exploits of their corsairs or the
assassination of their beys or deys. These governments, by sending
occasional “presents” to the sultans at Constantinople, maintained
virtual independence. The people lived pre- dominantly by agriculture or
piracy; the ransoms paid for Christian captives were a substantial part
of the national income; the corsair captains, however, were mostly
Christians. 19 The arts maintained a precarious existence, but the
Moroccan builders kept enough skill to blazon with radiant blue and
green tiles the lordly “Bab - Afansur” that was added as a gateway in
1732 to the</p>
<p>in. Persia: 1722-89</p>
<p>A Persian would have expressed similar relief on returning to his
native land after a sojourn in Christendom, or even in Ottoman Islam.
Until the fall of the Safavid dynasty (1736) an educated Persian would
probably have ranked Iranian civilization as superior to any
contemporary culture except possibly the Chinese. He would have
deprecated Christianity as a reversion to popular polytheism. He might
have admitted the superiority of Christen- dom in science, commerce, and
war, but he would have preferred art to sci- ence and handicrafts to
mechanized industry.</p>
<p>The eighteenth was a bitter century for Persia. Conquered by Afghans
from the southeast, harassed by slave-gathering raids from the Uzbeks in
the northeast, attacked by Russian depredations in the north, repeatedly
overrun by vast Turkish armies in the west, impoverished by the
taxgathering tyr- anny of its own spectacular Nadir Shah, and
dismembered by the brutal conflict of rival families for the Persian
throne — how could Iran continue, in this turbulence, the great
traditions of Persian literature and art?</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century the land now called Afghanistan was divided
by three governments: Kabul under Indian rule, Balkh under the Uzbeks,
and Herat and Kandahar under the Persians. In 1706-08 the Afghans of

<p>har rose under Mir (Amir) Vais and expelled the Persians. His son Mir
Mah- mud invaded Persia, deposed the Safavid ruler Husein, and made
himself shah. Religion strengthened his arms, for the Afghans followed
the Sunni, or orthodox, form of Mohammedanism, and considered the Shi’a
Persians to be damned infidels. Mahmud put to death in hot blood three
thousand of Husein’s bodyguard, three hundred Persian nobles, and some
two hundred children suspected of resenting the murder of their fathers.
After a long rest Mahmud in one day (February 7, 1725) slaughtered all
the surviving mem- bers of the royal family except Husein and two of his
younger children. Then Mahmud went insane, and was killed, aged
twenty-seven, by his cou- sin Ashraf (April 22, 1725), who proclaimed
himself shah. So began the bloodletting that devitalized Persia in that
century.</p>
<p>Tahmasp, son of Husein, appealed to Russia and Turkey for help; they
responded by agreeing to partition Persia between them (1725). A Turkish
army entered Persia and took Hamadan, Kazvin, and Maragha, but was de-
feated by Ashraf near Kermanshah. The Turkish troops lacked fervor; why,
they asked, should they fight their fellow Sunnis, the Afghans, to
restore the heretical Shi’a Safavids? The Turks made peace with Ashraf,
but retained the provinces they had conquered (1727).</p>
<p>Ashraf now seemed secure, but a year later his usurped and alien
power was challenged by the rise of an obscure Persian who swept in a
few years through a military career as brilliant and bloody as any in
history. Nadir Kuli (i.e., “Slave of the Wonderful”— i.e., of Allah) was
born in a tent in north- eastern Iran (1686). He helped his father to
tend their flocks of sheep and goats; he had no schooling but a hard and
adventurous life. When he was eighteen, and had succeeded his dead
father as head of the family, he and his mother were carried off by
Uzbek raiders to Khiva and were sold as slaves. The mother died in
bondage, but Nadir escaped, became the head of a rob- ber band, captured
Kalat, Nishapur, and Meshed, declared himself and these cities loyal to
Shah Tahmasp, and undertook to drive the Afghans out of Persia and
restore Tahmasp to the Persian throne. He accomplished this in swift
campaigns (1729- 30); Tahmasp was reinstated, and made Nadir “sul - tan”
of Khurasan, Seistan, Kerman, and Ma zanderan.</p>
<p>The victorious general soon set out to recover the provinces that
Turkey had seized. By decisively defeating the Turks at Hamadan (1731)
he brought Iraq and Azerbaijan under Persian rule. Hearing of a
rebellion in Khurasan, he raised the siege of Erivan and marched
fourteen hundred miles across Iraq and Iran to invest Herat — a march
that dwarfs the famous crossings of Germany by Frederick the Great in
the Seven Years’ War. Meanwhile Tahmasp in person took the field against
the Turks, lost all that Nadir had won, and ceded Georgia and Armenia to
Turkey on promise of Turkish help against Russia (1732). Nadir rushed
back from the east, denounced the treaty, deposed and imprisoned
Tahmasp, set up Tahmasp’s six -month-old son as Shah Abbas III,
proclaimed himself regent, and sent Turkey a declara- tion of war.</p>
<p>Having raised, by persuasion or conscription, an army of eighty
thousand men, he marched against the Turks. Near Samarra he encountered
a vast</p>

<p>Turkish force led by Topal Osman, who, maimed in both legs, commanded
from a litter. Nadir twice had horses shot under him; his
standard-bearer fled, thinking him slain; an Arab contingent on whose
aid he had relied turned against him; the Persian rout was complete
(July 1 8, 1733). He as- sembled the remnants at Hamadan, recruited,
armed, and fed new thousands, marched again to meet the Turks, and
overwhelmed them at Leilan in a holo- caust in which Topal Osman was
killed. Another revolt having broken out in southeastern Persia, Nadir
again crossed from west to east, and overcame the rebel leader, who
committed suicide. Marching back across Persia and Iraq, he met eighty
thousand Turks at Baghavand (1735), and so thoroughly defeated them that
Turkey signed a peace ceding Tiflis, Gandzha, and Erivan to Persia.</p>
<p>Nadir had not forgotten that Peter the Great had attacked Persia
in</p>
<p>1722-23, appropriating the Caspian provinces of Gilan, Astarabad, and
Mazanderan, and the cities of Derbent and Baku. Russia, busy on other
fronts, had restored the three provinces to Persia (1732). Now (1735)
Nadir threatened that unless Russia withdrew from Derbent and Baku he
would ally himself with Turkey against Russia. The two cities were
surrendered, and Nadir entered Isfahan as the triumphant rebuilder of
Persian power. When the child Abbas III died (1736), ending the Safavid
dynasty, Nadir wedded reality to form, and made himself Nadir Shah.</p>
<p>Believing that the religious differences between Turkey and Persia
made for repeated wars, he declared that henceforth Persia would abandon
its Shi‘a heresy and accept the orthodoxy of Sunni Islam. When the head
of the Shi‘a sect condemned this move Nadir had him strang led as
quietly as possible. He confiscated the religious endowments of Kazvin
to meet the expenses of his army, saying that Persia owed more to its
army than to its religion. 22 Then, lonesome for war, he appointed his
son Riza Kuli regent, and led 100,000 men to the conquest of Afghanistan
and India.</p>
<p>For a year he besieged Kandahar. When it surrendered (1738) he
treated its defenders so leniently that a troop of Afghans enlisted
under his standard and remained faithful to him till his death. He
marched on to Kabul, the key to the Khyber Pass; there the captured
booty enabled him to keep his army in good spirits. Mohammed Shah, Mogul
emperor of India, had refused to be- lieve a Persian invasion possible;
one of his governors had killed Nadir’s envoy; now Nadir crossed the
Himalayas, took Peshawar, crossed the Indus, and advanced to within
sixty miles of Delhi before Mohammed’s army re - sisted him. On the
plain of Karnal the immense hordes met in battle (1739); the Indians
relied on their elephants, the Persians attacked these patient ani- mals
with fireballs; the elephants turned and fled, throwing the Indian army
into disorder; ten thousand Indians were slain, more were captured; Mo-
hammed Shah came as a su ppliant for mercy “to our heavenly presence,”
Nadir reported. 23 The victor exacted from him the surrender of Delhi
and of nearly all its portable wealth, amounting to £ 87,500,000, and
including the famous Peacock Throne, which had been made (1628-35) for
Shah Jehan at the zenith of Mogul power. A riot among the populace
killed some of Nadir’s soldiers; he avenged them by allowing his army to
massacre</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>100,000 natives in seven hours. He apologized for this by giving his
son Nasrulla in marriage to Mohammed’s daughter. Then he marched
unimpeded back to Persia, having established himself as the greatest
conqueror since Timur.</p>
<p>It was his fatality that if he disbanded his army it might create
havoc and rebellion; if he kept it in force it would have to be clothed
and fed; his con- clusion was that war would be cheaper than peace if
the war could be fought on foreign soil. Whom should he attack next? He
remembered the Uzbek raids on northeast Persia, and his own enslavement,
and his mother’s death</p>
<p>Nadir was all soldier, with no mind left for statesmanship. Peace
became for him an intolerable bore. His spoils made him avaricious
instead of gen- erous. Enriched by Indian treasure, he declared a three
years’ moratorium on taxes in Persia; then he changed his mind and
ordered the accustomed pay- ments; his tax collectors impoverished
Persia as if it had been a conquered land. He suspected his son of
plotting to depose him; he had him blinded. “It is not my eyes that you
have put ou t,” said Riza Kuli, “but the eyes of Persia.” 24 The
Persians began to hate their savior, as the Russians had learned to hate
Peter the Great. The religious leaders roused against him the resent-
ment of a nation offended in its religious faith. He tried to suppress
the rising rebellion by wholesale executions; he built pyramids from the
skulls of the victims. On June 20, 1747, four members of his own
bodyguard entered his tent and attacked him; he killed two of them; the
others cut him down. All Persia breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>After him the country fell into worse disorder than under the Afghan
domination. Several provincial khans claimed the throne; a contest of
as- sassination ensued. Ahmed Khan Durani contented himself with
founding the modern kingdom of Afghanistan; Shah Rukh — handsome,
amiable, hu- mane — was blinded shortly after his accession, and retired
to rule Khurasan till 1796. Karim Khan emerged victorious from the
contest, and established (1750) the Zand dynasty, which held power till
1794. Karim made Shiraz his capital, adorned it with handsome buildings,
and gave South Persia twenty-nine years of moderate order and peace.
Upon his death the scramble for power took again the form of civil war,
and chaos was restored.</p>
<p>With the overthrow of the Safavid dynasty by the Afghans, Persia
ended the last of her great periods in art, and only some minor
productions graced this century. The Madrasa-i-Shah-Husein (1714) at
Isfahan, a college for training scholars and lawyers, was described by
Lord Curzon as “one of the stateliest ruins in Persia”; 25 Sir Percy
Sykes marveled at its “exquisite tiles… and lovely stenciling.” 26 The
tilemakers were still the ablest in the world, but the impoverishment of
the upper classes by protracted wars</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>ISLAM</p>
<p>4 21</p>
<p>destroyed the market for excellence, and compelled the potters to
lower their art into an industry. Splendid book covers were made of
lacquered papier mache. Textile workers produced brocades and embroidery
of consummate finesse. Persian rugs, though they had seen their last
supremacy under Shah Abbas I, were still woven for the fortunate of many
nations. Especially at Joshagan, Herat, Kerman, and Shiraz, the weavers
produced carpets that “suffer only by comparison with their classical
predecessors.” 27</p>
<p>The Afghan conquest broke the heart of Persian poetry, and left it
almost voiceless through the ensuing servitude. Lutf ’Ali Beg Adar,
about 1750, compiled a biographical dictionary of Persian poets,
concluding with sixty contemporaries; despite this apparent abundance,
he deplored what seemed to him the dearth of good writers in his time,
and ascribed it to the prevalent chaos and misei v, “which have reached
such a point that no one has the heart to read poetry, let alone compose
it.” 28 Typical was the experience of Shaykh ’Ali Hazin, who wrote four
diwans (collections) of verse, but was caught in die siege of Isfahan by
the Afghans; all the dwellers in his household died then except himself;
he recovered, fled from the ruins of the once beautiful city, and spent
the last thirty-three years of his life in India. In his Memoirs (1742)
he commemorated a hundred Persian poets of his time. Accounted greatest
of these was Say y id Ahmad Hatif of Isfahan; probably the most praised
of his poems was an ecstatic reaffirmation of faith in God despite doubt
and desolation:</p>
<p>In the church I said to a Christian charmer of hearts, “O thou in
whose net the heart is held captive!</p>
<p>O thou to the warp of whose girdle each hair tip of mine is
separately bound!</p>
<p>How long wilt thou miss the way to the Divine Unity? How long wilt
thou impose upon the One the shame of the Trinity?</p>
<p>How can it be right to name the One True God “Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost“?</p>
<p>She parted her sweet lips and said to me, while with sweet laughter
she poured sugar from her lips:</p>
<p>“If thou art aware of the secret of the Divine Unity, do not cast
upon me the stigma of infidelity!</p>
<p>In three mirrors the Eternal Beauty casts a ray from His effulgent
counte- nance.“…</p>
<p>Whilst we were so speaking, this chant rose up beside us from the
church bell: “He is One and there is naught but He;</p>
<p>There is no God save Him alone!“…</p>
<p>In the heart of each atom which thou cleavest thou wilt behold a sun
in the midst.</p>
<p>If thou givest whatever thou hast to love, may I be accounted an
infidel if thou shouldst suffer a grain of loss!…</p>
<p>Thou wilt pass beyond the narrow straits of dimensions, and wilt
behold the spacious realms of the Placeless;</p>
<p>Thou shalt hear what ear hath not heard, and shalt see what eye hath
not seen; Until they shall bring thee to a place where, of the world and
its people, thou shalt behold One alone.</p>
<p>To that One thou shalt give love with heart and soul, until with the
eye of certainty thou shalt clearly see that</p>
<p>“He is One and there is naught but he;</p>
<p>There is no God save Him alone !“ 29</p>
