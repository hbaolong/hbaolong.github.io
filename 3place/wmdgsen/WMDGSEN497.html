<h4 id="chapter-xxviii">CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>
<p>The Migrations of Reform</p>
<p>1517-60</p>
<p>I. THE SCANDINAVIAN SCENE: I47O-1523</p>
<p>T HE piety of the people had by 1500 made the Church the economic
master of Scandinavia. In Denmark half the soil was owned by the</p>
<p>Church, and was tilled by tenants verging on serfdom. 1 Copenhagen
itself was an ecclesiastical fief. Clergy and nobility were exempt from
land taxes: the nobles because they served at their own expense in war,
the clergy be- cause they organized worship, morals, education, and
charity. The univer- sities at Copenhagen and Uppsala were of course in
ecclesiastical hands. The Church required a tenth, annually, of all
nonecclesiastical produce or in- come; it exacted a small fee for every
building raised, every child born, every couple married, every corpse
interred; it claimed a day of gratis labor from every peasant yearly;
and no one could inherit property without making a contribution to the
Church as the probate court of wills. 2 These imposts were defended as
financing the ministrations of the Church, but complaints rose that too
much of the proceeds went to maintain bishops in regal splendor. The
merchants of Denmark, harassed by Hanseatic dominance in the North and
Baltic seas, chafed at the additional competition of nobles and clergy
who directly exported, often in their own ships, the surplus product of
their estates. In Scandinavia, as elsewhere, nobles hankered after
ecclesiastical lands. And there, as elsewhere, nationalism conflicted
with the supernational Church.</p>
<p>In all three countries the Church supported the Scandinavian Union of
Calmar, which Christian I of Denmark had renewed ( 1457) . But in Sweden
a National party of burghers and peasants rejected the Union as in
effect a Danish supremacy, and proclaimed Sten Sture the Younger regent
of an independent nation (1512). Archbishop Gustav Trolle of Uppsala —
then the capital of Sweden — defended the Union; Sten Sture the Younger
de- posed him; Pope Leo X ordered him reinstated; Sture refused; Leo
inter- dicted religious services in Sweden, and commissioned Christian
II of Denmark to invade Sweden a nd punish the Regent. Christian’s first
attempt failed; he had to sign a truce; but he carried back with him to
Copenhagen (January 18, 1520) several hostages as pledges for Swedish
adherence to</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>622 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>the truce; one of these hostages was Gustavus Vasa. In a second
expedition Christian won a decisive victory, and Sture died of wounds
received in battle. His widow improvised an army, which held Stockholm
for five months against Danish siege; finally sh e surrendered on the
promise, by Christian’s general, of a general amnesty. On November 4
Christian was crowned King of Sweden by the restored and triumphant
Trolle.</p>
<p>On November 7 the leading Swedes who had supported Sture were sum-
moned to the presence of the King in the citadel of Stockholm. A repre-
sentative of Trolle accused them of major crimes in having deposed the
Archbishop and having destroyed his castle, and he called upon the King
to revenge these wrongs. Despite the amnesty seventy leading Swedes were
condemned to death. On November 8 they were beheaded in the Grand
Square; on November 9 several others were arrested and executed; some
spectators who expressed sympathy were added to the slaughter; and the
property of the dead was confiscated to the King. All Sweden cried out
with horror. The Union of Calmar, men said, was drowned in this
“Stockholm Bath of Blood,” and the Church suffered severely in public
esteem for having initiated the massacre. Christian had thought to make
his rule secure by de- stroying the brains of the National party. In
reality he had cleared a way to the throne for the young hostage who was
to make Sweden free.</p>
<p>His name was Gustavus Eriksson, but posterity called him also Vasa,
from the bundle (Swedish vasa, Latin fascis ) of sticks that appeared in
his family’s coat of arms. At thirteen he was sent to study at Uppsala;
at twenty he was called to the court of Sture the Younger, who had
married a half-sister of Gustavus’s mother; an d there he received
further instruction from the prime minister, Bishop Hemming Gad. In 1519
he escaped from surveillance in Denmark, made his way to Lubeck,
persuaded its senate (always hostile to Denmark) to lend him money and a
ship, and regained his native shores (May 3 1, 1520) . For months he
wandered in disguise, or hid in obscure vil- lages. In November news
reached him that nearly a hundred Swedish pa- triots, including his
father, had been slaughtered in Stockholm. He mounted the swiftest horse
he could find, and rode north to his own province of Dalecarlia,
resolved to organize there, from the hardy yeomanry, the be- ginnings of
an army that might free Sweden from the Danes.</p>
<p>His life was now an epic worthy of Homeric song. Traveling icy roads,
he sought rest at the home of a former schoolmate. This friend gave him
every hospitality, and then went off to notify the pro-Danish police
that the escaped hostage could now be caught; but the wife warned
Gustavus to flee. Riding onward twenty miles, he found asylum with a
priest, who hid him for a week. Moving thirty miles farther, he tried to
rouse the town of Rattvik to revolt; but its people had not yet heard,
and would not believe, the story of the Bath of Blood. Vasa rode over
frozen meadows twenty-five</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 6lJ</p>
<p>miles north to Mora, and again pleaded for a revolutionary uprising,
but the peasants listened in skeptical apathy. Friendless and for a
moment hope- less, Gustavus turned his horse to the west, resigned to
seeking asylum in Norway. Before he reached the frontier a messenger
from Mora overtook him, and begged him to come back, pledging that now
he would be heard with a spirit as hot as his own. The peasants had at
last heard of the horror in Stockholm; moreover, it was rumored that the
King was planning to journey through Sweden, and had ordered gallows to
be set up in every major town. New taxes were to be imposed upon a
people already struggling for life against the greed of masters and the
tyranny of the elements. When Gustavus spoke again to the citizens of
Mora they gave him a bodyguard of sixteen highlanders, and vowed to arm
themselves, discipline themselves, and follow wherever he led them
against the Danes.</p>
<p>They knew no weapons yet but bows and arrows and axes. Vasa taught
them to make javelins and pikes with iron heads. He trained them with
all the ardor of a youth inspired by love of country and power. So
inspired, they captured Vesteres, then Uppsala; once more Archbishop
Trolle fled. Patiently, resolutely, the growing army won province after
province from the Danish garrisons. Christian II could not come to lead
his forces in per- son, for in his own country he was confronted by
civil strife, but his navy repeatedly raided Swedish shores. Gustavus
dispatched emissaries to Liibeck to ask for ships of war. For a large
promised sum the merchant city equipped ten vessels, which diverted the
energies of the Danish fleet. On June 7, 1523, the victorious
revolutionaries, in a new Riksraad, named their leader King Gustavus I;
on June 20 Stockholm surrendered to him, and thereafter Vasa made it his
capital. Mean while Christian II had been deposed in Denmark, and
Frederick I, his successor, renounced all Danish claims to sovereignty
over Sweden. The Union of Calmar (1397-1523) came to an end; the Vasa
dynasty began.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SWEDISH REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Gustavus was still a youth of twenty-seven. He was not as tall as we
expect men of the north to be, but he had a Viking’s vigor of body, his
round face was ruddy with health, and his long yellow beard gave him a
dignity be- fitting his royalty rather than his age. His morals were
excellent for a king, and even the Church that he was soon to reject
could not impugn his piety. He devoted himself to the tasks of
government with an impatient energy that sometimes slipped into violence
or tyranny, but the condition of Sweden at his accession almost
justified his temper and autocracy. In the chaos of war thousands of
peasants had left their farms unsown, miners had aban- doned their pits,
the cities were devastated with conflict, the currency was</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>624</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>debased, the national treasury was bankrupt, the executive brains of
the country had been spilled out in the “Bath.” The surviving feudal
barons con - sidered Gustavus an upstart, and looked down their noses at
his assumption of power. Conspiracies were formed to depose him; he put
them down with a strong arm. Finland, which had been part of Sweden, was
still in Danish hands, and Soren Norby, the Danish admiral, held the
strategic island of Gotland. Liibeck clamored for the repayment of its
loans.</p>
<p>The first need of a government is money paid, or promised, to the
armed forces that protect it, then to the officials that administer it.
But in Vasa’s Sweden taxes cost almost as much to collect as they
brought in, for those who alone could pay them were strong enough to
resist. Gustavus stooped to the desperate expediency of again debasing
the coinage, but the bad coins soon fell to their actual value, and the
state’s finances were worse than be - fore. Only one group in Sweden was
still rich — the clergy. Gustavus turned to them for aid, thinking it
just that the wealth of the Church should alleviate the poverty of the
people and the government. In 1523 he wrote to Bishop Hans Brask of
Linkoping for a donation of 5,000 guilders to the state. The Bishop
protested and yielded. To the churches and monasteries of Sweden Vasa
sent an urgent request that all money and precious metal not indis-
pensable to the continuance of their services should be remitted to the
gov- ernment as a loan; and he published a list of the amounts he
expected from each source. The response was not what he had hoped for,
and he began to wonder whether it would not be wise to do as the
Lutheran princes of Ger- many were doing — confiscate the wealth of the
Church to the needs of the state. He had not forgotten that most of the
higher clergy had opposed the revolution, and had buttressed the rule of
Christian II in Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1519 Olaus Petri, son of a Swedish ironmaster, returned from
several years of study in Wittenberg. As deacon of the cathedral school
at Strang- nars he permitted himself some heresies — that purgatory was
a myth, that prayers should be addressed, and confession should be made,
only to God, and that the preaching of the Gospel was better than the
ritual of the Mass. The writings of Luther began to circulate in Sweden.
Brask importuned Vasa to forbid their sale; the King replied that
“Luther’s teachings have not been found by impartial judges to be
false.” 8 Perhaps he th ought it politic to keep a heretic in reserve as
a bargaining point with the Church.</p>
<p>Matters grew livelier when Pope Adrian VI refused to confirm his own
legate, Johannes Magnus, as Archbishop of Uppsala, and proposed to
restore Gustav Trolle, enemy of the revolution. Vasa sent to the Curia a
letter that would then (1523) have shocked, and would later have
delighted, Henry VIII:</p>
<p>If our Most Holy Father has any care for the peace of our
country,</p>
<p>we shall be pleased to have him confirm the election of his legate .
. .</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVTIl) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 6l we shall comply with the
Pope’s wishes as to a reformation of the Church and religion. But if His
Holiness, against our honor and the</p>
<p>peace of our subjects, sides with the crime-stained partisans of</p>
<p>Archbishop Trolle, we shall allow his legate to return to Rome,
and</p>
<p>shall govern the Church in this country with the authority which</p>
<p>we have as king.</p>
<p>Adrian’s death, and the absorption of Clement VII with Luther,
Charles V, and Francis I left Vasa free to advance the Swedish
Reformation. He appointed Olaus Petri to the church of St. Nicholas at
Stockholm; he made Olaus’s brother Laurentius professor of theology at
Uppsala, and raised a third reformer, Laurentius Andreae, to be
archdeacon of the cathedral. In the chapter house of the cathedral,
under the presidency of the King, Olaus Petri defended Lutheranism in
debate with Peter Galle (December 27,</p>
<p>1524). Vasa judged Olaus victor, and was not disturbed when Olaus,
four months before Luther’s marriage, took a wife (1525). Bishop Brask,
how - ever, was shocked by this violation of clerical celibacy, and
demanded that the King should place Petri under the ban. Gustavus
replied that Olaus should be punished if he had d one wrong, but “it
would seem surprising if that should be the effect of marriage (a
ceremony not forbidden by God), and yet for debauchery, and other sins
that are forbidden, one should not fall under the ban.” 4 Instead of
outlawing Petri he commissio ned him and his brother to translate the
Bible into Swedish. As in many other countries the vernacular version
helped to form the national language, and to transform the national
religion.</p>
<p>Gustavus, like most rulers, considered any measure moral that
strengthened his country or his throne. He saw to it that bishops
pliable to his plans should be promoted to Swedish sees. He found
irresistible reasons for appropriating, gradatim , monastic lands; and
as he shared the spoils with the nobles, he ex- plained that he was
merely returning to laymen what their ancestors had been wheedled into
giving to the Church. Pope Clement VII complained that Swedish priests
married, gave communion in bread and wine, neglected the sacrament of
extreme unction, and altered the ritual of the Mass; and he appealed to
the King to remain faithful to the Church. But Gustavus had gone too far
to come back; orthodoxy would have ruined his treasury. At the Diet of
Vesteres (1527) he openly declared for the Reformation.</p>
<p>It was an historic meeting in both its constitution and its results.
Four bishops, four canons, fifteen members of the Riksraad, 1 29 nobles,
thirty-two burgesses, fourteen deputies of the miners, 104
representatives of the peas- antry — this was one of the broadest-based
national assemblies of the sixteenth century. The King’s chancellor laid
a revolutionary proposal before the Diet: the state, he said, was so
impoverished that it could not function for the good of the people; the
Swedish Church was so rich that it could transfer</p>
<p>626 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>much of its wealth to the government and yet have enough left to
fulfill all its tasks. Bishop Brask, fighting to the last for his own
ideals and realty, de- clared that the Pope had commanded the clergy to
defend their property. The Diet voted in favor of obeying the Pope.
Gustavus, staking everything on one throw, announced that if this was
the sentiment of the Diet and the nation he would resign and leave
Sweden. For three days the assembly de- bated. The burghers and the
deputies of the peasants came over to the side of the King; the nobles
had good cause for moving in the same direction; finally the Diet,
convinced that Vasa was more valuable to Sweden than any pope, agreed to
the royal wishes. In the Recess or conclusions of Vesteres the
monasteries were made fiefs of the King, though the monks were allowed
to use them; all property granted by nobles to the Church since 1454 was
to be returned to the donors’ heirs; the bishops were to surrender their
castles to the Crown; no bishop was to seek papal confirmation; the
clergy were to yield to the state all income not needed for their
services; auricular confes- sion was ended, and all sermons were to be
based exclusively on the Bible. In Sweden, even more decisively than
elsewhere, the Reformation was the nationalization of religion, the
triumph of the state over the Church.</p>
<p>Vasa survived this crisis for thirty-three years, and remained to the
end a forceful but beneficent autocrat. He was convinced that only a
centralized authority could reorganize Sweden into order and prosperity,
that in so complex a task he could not stop at every step to consult a
deliberative assem- bly. Under his encouragement and regulation the
mines of the north poured their iron into the sinews of Sweden; industry
expanded; commercial treaties with England, France, Denmark, and Russia
found markets for Swedish goods, brought into Sweden the products of a
dozen lands, and gave new refinement and confidence to a civilization
that before him had been arrested in rural and illiterate simplicity.
Sweden flourished now as never before.</p>
<p>Gustavus engaged in several wars, suppressed four rebellions, and
took in succession three wives. The first bore him the future Eric XIV ;
the second gave him five sons and five daughters; the third, who was
sixteen when he, fifty-six, married her, outlived him by sixty years. He
induced the Rigsraad to accept his sons as heirs to the throne, and to
establish hereditary succession in the male line as a rule for Swedish
royalty. Sweden forgave his dictator- ship, because it understood that
order is the parent, not the child, of liberty. When he died (September
29, 1560), after a reign of thirty-seven years, he was buried in Uppsala
Cathedral with fond and lavish ceremony. He had not given his people the
personal freedom for which they seem so peculiarly fitted, but he had
given them collective freedom from foreign domination in religion or
government; and he had created the conditions under which his nation
could mature in economy, literature, and art. He was the father of
modern Sweden.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE DANISH REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Christian II of Denmark (r. 1513-23) was as colorful a character as
the Gustavus Vasa who defeated him in Sweden. Forced by the barons to
sign humiliating “capitulations” as the price of his election, he
surrounded himself with middle-class advisers, ignored the Rigsraad of
highborn magnates, and took as his chief counselor the mother of his
beautiful Dutch mistress. This privy council must have had some ability
and spirit, for Chris tian’s domestic policy was as constructive as his
foreign adventures were futile. He labored assiduously in
administration, reformed the government of the cities, revised the laws,
put down piracy, improved the roads, began a public postal system,
abolished the worst evils of serfdom, ended the death penalty for
witchcraft, organized poor relief, opened schools for the poor, made
education compulsory, and developed the University of Copenhagen into a
light and haven of learning. He incurred the enmity of Liibeck by
restricting the power of the Hanse; he encouraged and protected Danish
trade; and he put an end to the barbarous custom by which maritime
villagers had been privileged to plunder all ships wrecked on their
shores.</p>
<p>In 1517 Leo X sent Giovanni Arcimboldo to Denmark to offer
indulgences. Paul Helgesen, a Carmelite monk, denounced what seemed to
him the sale of these indulgences; and in this he anticipated Luther’s
Theses. 5 Legate and King quarreled over the division of the proceeds;
Arcimboldo decamped to Liibeck with a part, Christian confiscated the
rest. Finding excellent reasons for Protestantism in the real abuses and
available wealth of the Church, Christian brought Helgesen to a post in
the University of Copenhagen, where, for a time, this eloquent Danish
Erasmus led the movement for reform. When Helgesen turned cautious,
Christian asked Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony to send him Luther
himself, or- at least some theologian of Luther’s school. Carl stadt
came, but did not stay long. Christian issued some reform legislation:
no one was to be ordained without having studied sufficiently to expound
the Gospel in Danish; the clergy could not legally own property or
receive bequests unless they married; bishops were bidden to moderate
their luxury; ecclesiastical courts lost jurisdiction where property was
involved; and a supreme court appointed by the King was to have final
authority over ecclesiastical as well as civil affairs. However, when
the Diet of Worms placed Luther under the Imperial ban Christian
suspended his reforms, and Helgesen advised reconciliation with the
Church.</p>
<p>While these domestic policies were exciting his people, Christian
lost the reins by his failures in foreign affairs. His cruelty in Sweden
turned many Danes against him. Liibeck declared war on him for his
attacks upon Hanseatic ship- ping. Nobles and clergy, alienated by high
taxation and hostile legislation, ignored his summons to a national
assembly, and proclaimed his uncle, Duke Frederick of
Schleswig-Holstein, as the new king of Denmark. Christian fled to
Flanders with his queen, the Protestant sister of Charles V; he made his
peace</p>
<p>6z8</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>with the Church, hoping to get a kingdom for a Mass; he was captured
in a futile attempt to regain his throne, and for twenty-seven years he
lived in the dungeons of Sonderborg with no companion but a half-wit
Norwegian dwarf. The paths of glory led him with leisurely ignominy to
the grave (1559).</p>
<p>Frederick I found no happiness under his challenged crown. Nobles and
clergy had accepted him on many conditions, one of which was that he
would never allow a heretic to preach in Denmark. Helgesen, while
continuing to criticize the shortcomings of the Church, now turned most
of his passionate polemics against the Protestants, urging that gradual
reform was better than turbulent revolution. But he could not stem the
tide. Frederic k’s son, Duke Christian, was already a Lutheran, and the
King’s daughter, with his consent, had married Albrecht of Brandenburg,
the Lutheran ex-head of the Teutonic Knights. In 1526 Frederick veered
with the wind, and appointed as his chaplain Hans Tausen, who had
studied under Luther. Tausen left his monastery, married, and openly
advocated Lutheran ideas. Frederick found it convenient to order that
episcopal confirmation fees should be paid to him, not to the pope.
Lutheran preachers took courage and multiplied; the bishops asked for
their expulsion; Frederick answered that he had no lordship over men’s
souls, and was resolved to leave faith free — a most unusual proceeding.
In 1524 a Dardsl; translation of the New Testament appeared; in 1529 a
much better version was published by Christian Pedersen, which immensely
advanced the Protestant development. The people, eager to end tithe
payments to the clergy, readily accepted the new theology; by 1530 the
Lutherans dominated Copenhagen and Viborg. In that year, at the Diet of
Copenhagen, a public debate was held be- tween Catholic and Protestant
leaders; both King and people gave the victory to the Protestants; and
the Confession of Faith presented there by Hans Tausen remained for a
decade the official creed of the Danish Lutherans.</p>
<p>Frederick’s death (1533) ushered in the final act of the Danish
Reformation. The merchant princes of Denmark joined with their old
enemies in Liibeck in an attempt to restore Christian II; Count
Christopher of Oldenburg led the Liibeck forces and gave his name to the
“Count’s War”; Copenhagen fell to him, and Liibeck dreamed of ruling all
Denmark. But the burghers and peasants rallied to the standard of
Frederick’s son Christian; their army defeated Old en- burg, and
captured Copenhagen after a year’s siege (July 1536). All bishops were
arrested, and were released only on promising to abide by the Protestant
regime. The national assembly, in October 1536, formally established the
Luth- eran State Church, with Christian III as its supreme head. All
episcopal and monastic properties were confiscated to the King, and the
bishops lost all voice in the government. Norway and Iceland accepted
Christian III and his legisla- tion, and the triumph of Lutheranism in
Scandinavia was complete (1554).</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIIl) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM</p>
<p>629</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PROTESTANTISM IN EASTERN EUROPE</li>
</ol>
<p>Poland had her Golden Age under Sigismund I (1506-48) and his son
Sigismund II (1548-72). Both were men of culture and spirit, discerning
patrons of literature and art, and both gave to religious thought and
worship a freedom which, though imperfect, made most other nations of
Europe seem medieval by comparison. Sigismund I married the gay and
talented Bona Sforza (1518), daughter of Duke Giangaleazzo of Milan; she
brought to Cracow a retinue of Italian courtiers and scholars, and the
King, instead of resenting them, welcomed them as a bridge to the
Renaissance. A taste for luxury in ornate dress and rich furnishings
took hold of the aristocracy, lan- guage and manners became more
refined, letters and arts flourished, and Erasmus wrote (1523): “I
congratulate this nation . . . which now, in</p>
<p>sciences, jurisprudence, morals, and religion, and in all that
separates us from barbarism, is so flourishing that it can rival the
first and most glorious of nations.” 6 Dominating her husband by her
beauty, grace, and craft, Bona became queen in fact as well as in
fashion. Her son Sigismund II was a hu- manist, linguist, orator, and
transvestite. 7 Wars marred these brilliant reigns, for Poland was
involved with Sweden, Denmark, and Russia in a contest for control of
the Baltic Sea and its ports. Poland lost Prussia, but she absorbed
Mazovia, including Warsaw (1529), and Livonia, including Riga (1561).
Poland was in this age a major European state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Reformation filtered in from Germany and Switzerland.
The freedom of worship guaranteed by the Polish Crown to its Greek
Catholic subjects had habituated the nation to religious tolerance, and
the century-long rebellion of Hussites and Utraquists in neighboring
Bohemia had made Poland somewhat careless of distant papal authority.
The bishops, nominated by the Kings, were cultured patriots, favoring
Church reform with Erasmian caution, and generously supporting the
humanist movement. This, however, did not allay the envy with which
nobles and townsmen looked upon their property and revenues. Complaints
grew of national wealth being drained off to Rome, of indulgences
expensively absurd, of ecclesiastical simony, of costly litigation in
episcopal courts. The szlachta , or lesser nobility, took particular
offense at the exemption of the clergy from taxation, and the clerical
collection of tithes from the nobles themselves. Probably for economic
reasons some influential barons listened with sympathy to Lutheran
criticism of the Church; and the semi- sovereignty of the individual
feudal lords provided protection to local Protes- tant movements, much
as the independence of the German princes made possible the revolt and
shielding of Luther. In Danzig a monk championed Luther’s Theses, called
for ecclesiastical reforms, and married an heiress (1518); another
preacher followed the Lutheran vein so effectively that several
congregations removed all religious images from their churches (1522);
the city council re-</p>
<p>63O THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVHI</p>
<p>leased monks and nuns from their vows, and closed the monasteries
(1525); by 1540 all Danzig pulpits were in Protestant hands. When some
clergymen in Polish-Prussian Braunsberg introduced the Lutheran ritual,
and the cathedral canons complained to their bishop, he replied that
Luther based his views on the Bible, and that whoever felt able to
refute them might undertake the task (1520). 8 Sigismund I was prevailed
upon to censor the press and forbid the importation of Luthera n
literature; but his own secretary and Bona’s Franciscan confessor were
secretly won to the forbidden creed; and in 1539 Calvin dedi- cated his
Commentary on the Mass to the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>When the Prince became Sigismund II both Lutheranism and Calvinism
advanced rapidly. The Bible was translated into Polish, and the
vernacular began to replace Latin in religious services. Prominent
priests like Jan Laski announced their conversion to Protestantism. In
1548 the Bohemian Brethren, exiled from their own country, moved into
Poland, and soon there were thirty conventicles of their sect in the
land. The attempt of the Catholic clergy to indict some members of the
szlachta for heresy, and to confiscate their property, led many minor
nobles to rebel against the Church (1552). The national Diet of 1555
voted religious freedom for all faiths based on “the pure Word of God,”
and legalized clerical marriage and communion in bread and wine. The
Reform in Poland was now at its crest.</p>
<p>The situation was complicated by the development, in Poland, of the
strongest Unitarian movement in sixteenth-century Europe. As early as
1546 the anti- trinitarian tentatives of Servetus were discussed in this
Far East of Latin Christianity. Laelius Socinus visited Poland in 1551,
and left a ferment of radical ideas; Giorgio Blandrata continued the
campaign; and in 1561 the new group issued its confession of faith.
Continuing the confusion of Servetus’s theology, they restricted full
divinity to God the Father, but professed belief in the super- natural
birth of Christ, His divine inspiration, miracles, resurrection, and
ascen- sion. They rejected the ideas of original sin and Christ’s
atonement; they admitted baptism and communion as symbols only; and they
taught that salvation depended above all upon a conscientious practice
of Christ’s teachings. When the Calvinist synod of Cracow (1563)
condemned these doctrines, the Unitarians formed their own separate
church. The full flourishing of the sect came only with Laelius’s nephew
Faustus Socinus, who reached Poland in 1579.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church fought these developments with persecution,
literature, and diplomacy. In 1539 the bishop of Cracow sent to the
stake an eighty-year- old woman on the charge that she refused to
worship the consecrated Host. 9 Stanislaus Hosius, Bishop of Kulm in
Prussia, later Cardinal, carried on the counteroffensive with ability
and zeal. He labored for ecclesiastical reform, but had no sympathy with
Protestant theology or ritual. At his suggestion Lodovico Lippomano,
Bishop of Verona, was sent to Poland as papal legate, and Giovanni
Commendone, Bishop of Zante, was made papal nuncio at Cracow. They won
Sigismund II to active support of the Church by stressing the divisions
among the Protestants, and magnifying the difficulty of organizing the
moral life of the nation on such inimical and fluctuating creeds. In
1564 Hosius and Com-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 63 1</p>
<p>mendone brought the Jesuits into Poland. These trained and devoted
men secured strategic places in the educational system, caught the ear
of pivotal personalities, and turned the Polish people back to the
traditional faith.</p>
<p>The Bohemians had been Protestants before Luther, and found little to
terrify them in his ideas. A large German element on the border readily
accepted the Reform; the Bohemian Brethren, numbering some 10 per cent
of the 400,000 population, were more Protestant than Luther; 60 per cent
were Utraquists — Catholics who took the Eucharist in wine as well as
bread, and ignored the protests of the popes. 10 By 1560 Bohemia was two
thirds Protestant; but in 1561 Ferdinand introduced the Jesuits, and the
tide turned back to the orthodox Catholic creed.</p>
<p>The Reformation came to Hungary through German immigrants bearing the
news of Luther — that one could defy the Church and the Empire and yet
live. Hungarian peasants oppressed by a Church-supported feudalism
viewed with some favor a Protestantism that might end ecclesiastical
tithes and dues; feudal barons looked with grasping eyes upon vast
Church properties whose products competed with their own; town laborers,
infected with Utopia, saw in the Church the chief obstacle to their
dream, and indulged in image-breaking ecstasies. The Church co-operated
by persuading the government to make Protestantism a capital crime. In
western Hungary King Ferdinand labored for a compromise, and wished to
allow clerical marriage and communion in both forms. In eastern Hungary
Protestantism spread freely under a Turkish rule scornfully indifferent
to varieties of Christian belief. By 1550 it seemed that all Hungary
would become Protestant. But Calvinism began then to compete with
Lutheranism in Hungary; the Magyars, constitutionally anti-German,
supported the Swiss style of Reform; and by 1558 the Calvinists were
numerous enough to hold an impressive synod at Czenger. The rival
focuses of reform tore the movement in two. Many officials or converts,
seeking social stability or mental peace, returned to Catholicism; and
in the seventeenth century the Jesuits, led by the son of a Calvinist,
restored Hungary to the Catholic fold.</p>
<p>V. CHARLES V AND THE NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>In the Flanders of Charles’s maturity a thriving commerce was more
than making up for sporadic industrial decline. Bruges and Ghent were
depressed, but Brussels survived by being the Flemish capital, Louvain
was brewing theology and beer, and Antwerp was becoming — would be by
1550 — the richest, busiest city in Europe. To that hectic port on the
broad and naviga- ble Scheldt international trade and finance were drawn
by low import and export dues, by the political connection with Spain,
and by a bourse dedi- cated, its inscription said, ad usum mercatorum
cuius que gentis ac linguae — “to the use of merchants of every land and
tongue.” 11 Business enterprise was here free from the guild
restrictions and municipal protectionism that</p>
<p>632 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>had kept medieval industry happily unprogressive. Here Italian
bankers opened agencies, English “merchant adventurers” established a
depot, the</p>
<p>He responded by giving Flanders and Holland reasonably good govern-
ment except in religious liberty — a boon hardly conceived by his
friends or his foes. His authority was constitutionally limited by his
sworn pledge to observe the charters and local laws of the cities and
provinces; by personal and domiciliary rights stoutly maintained by the
burghers; by councils of state and finance, and a court of appeal,
established as part of the central administration. Generally Charles
ruled the Netherlands by indirection, through regents acceptable to the
citizens: first his aunt, nurse, and tutor, Margaret of Austria, then
his sister Mary, ex-queen of Hungary, both women of competence,
humanity, and tact. But Charles became more im- perious with more
Empire. He stationed Spanish garrisons in the proud cities, and
suppressed with severity any serious contravention of his inter-
national policies. When Ghent refused to vote the military funds
demanded by him and granted by the other cities, Charles put down the
revolt by a show of indisputable force, exacted the subsidy and an
indemnity, abolished the traditional liberties of the municipality, and
substituted Imperial ap- pointees for the locally chosen government
(1540). 14 But this was hardly typical. Despite such occasional
harshness Charles remained popular with his Lowland subjects; he
received credit for the political stability and social order that
supported the economic prosperity; and when he announced his abdication
nearly all citizens mourned. 15</p>
<p>Accepting the current theory that national peace and strength
required unity of religious belief, and fearing that Protestantism in
the Netherlands would endanger his flank in his strife with France and
Lutheran Germany, Charles fully supported the Church in prosecuting
heresy in Flanders and Holland. The reform movement there was mild
before Luther; after 1517 it</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIIl) the migrations of reform 633</p>
<p>entered as Lutheranism and Anabaptism from Germany, as Zwinglianism
and Calvinism from Switzerland, Alsace, and France. Luther’s writings
were soon translated into Dutch, and were expounded by ardent preachers
in Antwerp, Ghent, Dordrecht, Utrecht, Zwolle, and The Hague. Dominican
friars led a vivacious rebuttal; one said he wished he could fasten his
teeth on Luther’s throat, and would not hesitate to go to the Lord’s
Supper with that blood on his mouth. 16 The Emperor, still young,
thought to stop the agitation by publishing ( 1 52 1 ) , at the Pope’s
request, a “placard” forbidding the printing or reading of Luther’s
works. In the same year he ordered the secular courts to enforce
throughout the Netherlands the Edict of Worms against all proponents of
Lutheran ideas. On July 1, 1523, Henry Voes and Johann Eck, two
Augustinian friars, were sent to the stake at Brussels as the first
Protestant martyrs in the Lowlands. Henry of Zutphen, friend and pupil
of Luther’s, and p rior of the Augustinian monastery at Antwerp, was
imprisoned, escaped, was caught in Holstein, and was there burned
(1524). These executions advertised the Reformers’ ideas.</p>
<p>Despite censorship Luther’s translation of the New Testament was
widely circulated, more fervently in Holland than in rich Flanders. A
longing for the restoration of Christianity to its pristine simplicity
generated a millenarian hope for the early return of Christ and the
establishment of a New Jerusalem in which there would be no government,
no marriage, and no property; and with these notions were mingled
communistic theories of equality, mutual aid, and even “free love.” 17
Anabaptist groups formed at Antwerp, Maas - tricht, and Amsterdam.
Melchior Hofmann came from Emden to Amsterdam in 1 5 3 1, and in 1 5 34
John of Leyden returned the visit by carrying the Ana- baptist creed
from Haarlem to Munster. In some Dutch towns it was esti- mated that two
thirds of the population were Anabaptists; in Deventer even the
burgomaster was converted to the cause. Fanned by famine, the move- ment
became a social revolt. “In these provinces,” wrote a friend to Erasmus
in 1534, “we are made extremely anxious by the Anabaptist conflagration,
for it is mounting up like flames. There is hardly a spot or town where
the torch of insurrection does not secretly glow.” 18 Mary of Hungary,
then Regent, warned the Emperor that the rebels planned to plunder all
forms of property among the nobility, clergy, and mercantile
aristocracy, and to distribute the spoils to every man according to his
need. 19 In 1535 John of Leyden sent emissaries to arrange a
simultaneous uprising of Anabaptists at several Dutch centers. The
rebels made heroic efforts; one group cap- tured and fortified a
monastery in West Friesland; the governor besieged them with heavy
artillery; 800 died in a hopeless defense (1535). On May 1 1 some armed
Anabaptists stormed and captured the city hall of Amster- dam; the
burghers dislodged them, and wreaked uoon the leaders the fright-</p>
<p>634 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>ful vengeance of frightened men: tongues and hearts were tom from
living bodies and flung into the faces of the dying or dead. 20</p>
<p>Thinking the whole social structure challenged by a communistic
revolu- tion, Charles imported the Inquisition into the Netherlands, and
gave its officials power to stamp out the movement, and all other
heresies, at what- ever cost to local liberties. Between 1521 and 1555
he issued placard after placard against social or religious dissent. The
most violent of these (Septem- ber 25, 1550) revealed the deterioration
of the Emperor, and laid the foun- dations for the revolt of the
Netherlands against his son.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 635</p>
<p>In addition, any person entering the Low Countries was required to
sign a pledge of loyalty to the full orthodox creed. 22</p>
<p>Through these desperate edicts the Netherlands were made a major bat-
tleground between the old and the new forms of Christianity. The
Venetian ambassador at Charles’s court estimated in 1546 that 30,000
persons, nearly all Anabaptists, perished in this prolonged Imperial
pogrom; 28 a less excited estimate reduced the victims to i,ooo. 24 So
far as the Dutch Anabaptists were concerned, the Caroline Inquisition
succeeded; a remnant survived in Hol- land by adopting non-resistance;
some fled to England, where they became active supporters of
Protestantism under Edward VI and Elizabeth. The communistic movement in
the Netherlands collapsed, frightened by prose- cution and stifled by
prosperity.</p>
<p>But as the Anabaptists wave subsided, a stream of hunted Huguenots
poured into the Lowlands from France, bringing the gospel of Calvin. The
stem and theocratic fervor of the new heresy appealed to those who in-
herited the traditions of the mystics and the Brethren of the Common
Life; and the Calvinist acceptance of work as a dignity instead of a
curse, of wealth as a blessing instead of a crime, of republican
institutions as more responsive than monarchy to the political ambitions
of the business class, contained in- gredients diversely welcome to many
elements in the population. By 1555 there were Calvinist congregations
in Ypres, Tournai, Valenciennes, Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp, and the
movement was spreading into Holland. It was with Calvinism, not
Lutheranism or Anabaptism, that Charles’s son would be locked, through a
bitter generation, in the conflict that would break the Netherlands in
two, liberate Holland from the Spanish domina- tion, and make her one of
the major homes and havens of the modern mind.</p>
<p>In 1555 Charles V put aside all dreams except that of dying in
sanctity. He relinquished his hope of either suppressing Protestantism
in Germany and the Netherlands, or reconciling it with Catholicism at
the Council of Trent. He abandoned his aspiration to lead Protestants
and Catholics, Ger- mans and French, in a magnificent march against
Suleiman, Constantinople, and the Turkish threat to Christendom. His
excesses in eating, drinking, and sex, his exhausting campaigns, the
burdens of an office that bore the brunt of revolutionary change, had
ruined his body, dulled his statesmanship, and broken his will.
Suffering from ulcers at thirty-three, old at thirty-five, af- flicted
at forty-five with gout, asthma, indigestion, and stammering, he was now
half his waking time in pain, and found it hard to sleep; often his
diffi- culty in breathing kept him sitting upright all the night
through. His fingers were so distorted with arthritis that he could
hardly grasp the pen with which he signed the Peace of Crepy. When
Coligny presented a letter from Henry II, Charles could hardly open it.
“What think you of me, Sir Ad -</p>
<p>636 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>miral?” he asked. “Am I not a fine knight to charge and break a
lance, I who can only open a letter after so much trouble?” 25 Perhaps
his occasional cruelty, and something of the savagery with which he
attacked Protestantism in the Netherlands, came from the exhaustion of
his patience by his pains. He ordered the amputation of the feet of
captured German mercenaries who had fought for France, though his son,
the future inexorable Philip II, begged mercy for them. 26 He had
mourned long and bitterly the death of his beloved wife Isabella (1539);
but in time he allowed helpless maidens to be brought to his bed. 27</p>
<p>In the fall of 1 555 he called a meeting of the States-General of the
Nether- lands for October 25, and summoned Philip to it from England. In
the great tapestried hall of the dukes of Brabant at Brussels, where the
Knights of the Golden Fleece were wont to hold their assemblies, the
deputies, nobles, and magistrates of the seventeen provinces gathered
within a guard of armed soldiery. Charles entered leaning on the
shoulder of his son’s future enemy, William of Orange. Philip followed
with the Regent Mary of Hungary; then Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, and
the Emperor’s councilors, a nd the Knights of the Fleece, and many other
notables around whom the world once turned before forgetting them. When
all had been seated Philibert rose and explained, too lengthily and
vividly for Charles’s enjoyment, the med - ical, mental, and political
reasons why the Emperor wished to abdicate his rule in the Netherlands
to his son. Then Charles himself stood up, leaning again on the tall and
handsome Prince of Orange, and spoke simply and to the point. He
summarized his rise to successively wider powers, and the absorption of
his life in government. He recalled that he had visited Ger- many nine
times, Spain six, Italy seven, France four, England and Africa twice,
and had made eleven voyages by sea. He continued:</p>
<p>This is the fourth time that I am setting out hence for Spain. . .
.</p>
<p>Nothing that I have ever experienced has given me so much pain</p>
<p>… as that which I feel in parting from you today without leaving</p>
<p>behind me that peace and quiet which I so much desired. . . . But
I</p>
<p>am no longer able to attend to my affairs without great bodily
fatigue and consequent detriment to the state. . . . The cares which so
great a responsibility involves, the extreme dejection which it causes,
my</p>
<p>health already ruined — all these leave me no longer the vigor neces-
sary for governing. … In my present state I should have to render</p>
<p>a serious account to God and man if I did not lay aside
authority.</p>
<p>. . . My son, King Philip, is of an age sufficiently advanced to be
able</p>
<p>to govern you, and he will be, I hope, a good prince to all my
beloved subjects. . . , 28</p>
<p>When Charles sank painfully into his chair the audience forgot his
sins, his persecutions, and his defeats in pity for a man who for forty
years had</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 637</p>
<p>labored according ro his lights under the heaviest obligations of the
time. Many auditors wept. Philip was formally installed as ruler of the
Nether- lands, and took a solemn oath (as he would be later reminded) to
observe all the laws and traditional rights of the provinces. Early in
1556 Charles surrendered to him the crown of Spain, with all its
possessions in the Old World and the New. Charles reserved the Imperial
title, hoping to transmit that too ro his son; but Ferdinand protested,
and in 1558 the Emperor re- signed it to his brother. On September 17,
1556, Charles sailed from Flushing to Spain.</p>

<li>SPAIN: 1516-58</li>
</ol>
<p>1 . The Revolt of the Comuneros: 1520-22</p>
<p>It was a questionable boon for Spain that her King Charles I
(1516-56) became the Emperor Charles V (1519-58). Born and reared in
Flanders, he acquired Flemish ways and tastes, until in his final years
the spirit of Spain conquered him. The King could be only a small part
of the Emperor who had his hands full with the Reformation, the papacy,
Suleiman, Barbarossa, and Francis I; the Spaniards complained that he
gave them so little of his time and spent so much of their human and
material resources on campaigns apparently foreign to Spanish interests.
And how could an emperor sympa- thize with the communal institutions
that had made Spain half a democracy before the coming of Ferdinand the
Catholic, and that she so longed to restore?</p>
<p>Charles’s fir st visit to his kingdom (1517) earned him no love.
Though king for twenty months past, he still knew no Spanish. His curt
dismissal of the devoted Ximenes shocked Spanish courtesy. He came
surrounded by Flemings who thought Spain a barbarous country waiting to
be milked; and the seventeen-year-old monarch appointed these leeches to
the highest posts. The various provincial Cortes, dominated by the
hidalgos or lower nobility, did not conceal their reluctance to accept
so alien a king. The Cortes of Castile refused him the title, then
grudgingly recognized him as co-ruler with his demented mother Juana;
and it let him understand that he must learn Spanish, live in Spain, and
name no more foreigners to office. Other Cortes laid down similar
demands. Amid these humiliations Charles received the news that he had
been elected emperor, and that Germany was summon- ing him to show
himself and be crowned. When he asked the Cortes at Valladolid (then the
capital) to finance the trip, he was rebuffed, and a public tumult
threatened his life. Finally he secured the money from the Cortes of
Corunna, and hurried off to Flanders. To make matters trebly</p>

cities, and left his former tutor, Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht, as regent
of Spain.</p>
<p>Now one after another of the Spanish municipalities rose in the
“Revolt of the Comuneros” or commune m embers. They expelled the
corregidores, murdered a few of the delegates who had voted funds to
Charles, and leagued themselves in a Santa Comunidad pledged to control
the King. Nobles, ecclesiastics, and burghers alike joined the movement,
and organ- ized at Avila (August 1520) the Santa Junta, or Holy Union,
as a central government. They demanded that the Cortes should share with
the royal council in choosing the regent, that no war should be made
without the con- sent of the Cortes, and that the town should be ruled
not by corregidores but by alcaldes or mayors chosen by the citizens. 29
Antonio de Acuna, Bishop of Zamora, openly advocated a republic, turned
his clergy into revolution- ary warriors, and gave the resources of his
diocese to the revolt. Juan de Padilla, a Toledo noble, was made
commander of the rebel forces. He led them to the capture of
Tordesillas, took Juana la Loca as a hostage, and urged her to sign a
document deposing Charles and naming herself queen. Wise in her madness,
she refused.</p>
<p>Adrian, having no soldiery strong enough to suppress the uprising,
ap- pealed to Charles to return, and frankly blamed the revolt on the
King’s arbitrary and absentee government. Charles did not come, but
either he or his councilors found a way to divide and conquer. The
nobles were warned that the rebellion was a threat to the propertied
classes as well as to the Crown. And indeed the working classes, long
oppressed with fixed wages, forced labor, and prohibition of unions, had
already seized power in several towns. In Valencia and its neighborhood
a Germania or Brotherhood of guildsmen took the reins, and ruled the
committees of workingmen. This proletarian dictatorship was unusually
pious; it imposed upon the thousands of Moors who still remained in the
province the choice of baptism or death; hundreds of the obstinate were
killed. 80 In Majorca the commons, whose masters had treated them as
slaves, rose in arms, deposed the royal governor, and slew every noble
who could not elude them. Many towns renounced their feudal ties and
dues. In Madrid, Sigiienza, and Guadalajara the new municipal
administration excluded all nobles and gentry from office; here and
there aristocrats were slain; and the Junta assessed for taxation noble
properties formerly exempt. Pillage became general; commoners burned the
palaces of nobles, nobles massacred commoners. Class war spread through
Spain.</p>
<p>The revolt destroyed itself by extending its aims beyond its powers.
The nobles turned against it, raised their own forces, co-operated with
those of the King, captured Valencia, and overthrew the proletarian
government after days of mutual slaughter (1521). At the height of the
crisis the rebel</p>

Junta also split into hostile factions; and each province carried on its
revolu- tion without co-ordination with the rest. Giron went over to the
royalists, who recaptured Tordesillas and Juana. Padilla’s dwindling
army was routed at Villalar, and he was put to death. When Charles
returned to Spain (July</p>

able to subdue the municipalities and the guilds, tame the Cortes, and
estab- lish an almost absolute monarchy. The democratic movement was so
com- pletely suppressed that the Spanish commons remained cowed and
obedient till the nineteenth century. Charles tempered his power with
courtesy, sur- rounded himself with grandees, and learned to talk good
Spanish; Spain was pleased when he remarked that Italian was the proper
language to use to women, German to enemies, French to friends, Spanish
to God. 81</li>

<li>The Spanish Protestants</li>
</ol>
<p>Only one power could now challenge Charles in Spain — the Church. He
was pro-Catholic but anti-papal. Like Ferdinand the Catholic he sought
to make the Spanish Church independent of the popes, and he so far
succeeded that during his rule ecclesiastical appointments and revenues
were in his con- trol, and were used to promote governmental policies.
In Spain, as in France, no Reformation was needed to subordinate the
Church to the state. None- theless, during the half of his reign that
Charles spent in his kingdom, the fervor of Spanish orthodoxy so worked
upon him that in his later years noth- ing (except the power of the
Hapsburgs) seemed more important to him than the suppression of heresy.
While the popes tried to moderate the In- quisition, Charles supported
it till his death. He was convinced that heresy in the Netherlands was
leading to chaos and civil war, and was resolved to circumvent such a
development in Spain.</p>
<p>The Spanish Inquisition abated its fury, but extended its
jurisdiction, un- ’er Charles. It undertook the censorship of
literature, had every bookstore ’arched, and ordered bonfires of books
charged with heresy. 32 It investi- ated and punished sexual
perversions. It instituted rules of limpieza (purity of blood), which
closed all avenues of distinction to descendants of Con- versos and to
all who had ever been penanced by the tribunal. It looked upon mystics
with a stern eye, for some of these claimed that their direct inter-
course with God exempted them from attending church, and others gave
their mystical ecstasies a suspiciously sexual flavor. The lay preacher
Pedro Ruiz de Alcaraz announced that coitus was really union with God;
and Friar Francisco Ortiz explained that when he lay with a pretty
fellow mystic</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVIH</p>
<p>— even when he embraced her naked body — it was not a carnal sin but
a spiritual delight . 83 The Inquisition dealt leniently with these
Alumbrados (Enlightened Ones), and kept its severest measures for the
Protestants of Spain.</p>
<p>As in northern Europe, an Erasmian skirmish preceded the Protestant
battle. A few liberal chu rchmen applauded the humanist’s strictures on
the faults of the clergy; but Ximenes and others had already reformed
the more palpable abuses before the coming of Charles. Perhaps
Lutheranism had seeped into Spain with Germans and Flemings in the royal
entourage. A German was condemned by the Inquisition at Valencia in 1524
for avowing Lutheran sympathies; a Flemish painter was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1 5 28 for questioning purgatory and indulgences.
Francisco de San Roman, the first-known Spanish Lutheran, was burned at
the stake in 1542, while fervent onlookers pierced him with their
swords. Juan Diaz of Cuenca im- bibed Calvinism at Geneva; his brother
Alfonso rushed up from Italy to reconvert him to orthodoxy; failing,
Alfonso had him killed (1546). 34 At Seville a learned canon of the
cathedral, Juan Gil or Egidio, was imprisoned for a year for preaching
against image worship, prayer to the saints, and the efficacy of good
works in earning salvation; after his death his bones were exhumed and
burned. His fellow canon, Constantino Ponce de la Fuente, continued his
propaganda, and died in the dungeons of the Inquisition. Four- teen of
Constantino’s followers were burned, including four friars and three
women; a large number were sentenced to diverse penalties; and the house
in which they had met was razed to the ground.</p>
<p>Another semi-Protestant group developed in Valladolid; and here
influ- ential nobles and high ecclesiastics were involved. They were
betrayed to the Inquisition; nearly all were arrested and condemned;
some, trying to leave Spain, were caught and brought back. Charles V,
then in retirement at Yuste, recommended that no mercy be shown them,
that the repentant should be beheaded, and the unrepentant burned. On
Trinity Sunday, May 21, 1559, fourteen of the condemned were executed
before a cheering crowd. 35 All but one recanted, and were let off with
beheading; Antonio de Herrezuelo, impenitent, was burned alive. His
twenty-three-year-old wife, Leonor de Cisneros, repentant, was allowed
life imprisonment. After ten years of confinement she retracted her
recantation, proclaimed her heresy, and asked to be burned alive like
her husband; her request was granted. 36 Twenty-six more of the accused
were displayed in an auto-da-fe on October 8, 1559, before a crowd of
200,000, presided over by Philip II. Two victims were burned alive, ten
were strangled.</p>
<p>The most famous prey of the Inquisition in this period was Bartolome
de Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. As a Dominican
friar he was active for many years in hounding heretics. Charles
appointed him</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE MIGRATIONS OF REFORM 641</p>
<p>envoy to the Council of Trent, and sent him to England to attend the
mar- riage of Philip and Queen Mary. When he was elected archbishop
(1557) only his own vote kept the choice from being unanimous. But some
of the “Protestants” arrested at Valladolid testified that Carranza had
secretly sympathized with their views; he was found to have corresponded
with the Spanish Italian reformer Juan de Valdes; and the influential
theologian Mel- chior Cano accused him of upholding the Lutheran
doctrine of justification by faith. He was arrested only two years after
his elevation to the highest ecclesiastical dignity in Spain; we may
judge from this the power of the Spanish Inquisition. For seventeen
years he was kept in one prison or another while his life and writings
were subjected to scrutiny at Toledo and Rome. Gregory XIII proclaimed
him “vehemently suspected” of heresy, ordered him to abjure sixteen
propositions, and suspended him for five years from the exercise of his
office. Carranza accepted the sentence humbly, and tried to perform the
penances assigned to him; but within five weeks, exhausted by
imprisonment and humiliation, he died (1576).</p>
<p>With him ended all danger of Protestantism in Spain. Between 1551 and
1600 there were some 200 executions there for Protestant heresies —
i.e., four per year. The temper of the people, formed by centuries of
hatred for Moors and Jews, had congealed into an unshakable orthodoxy;
Catholicism and patriotism had merged; and the Inquisition found it a
simple matter to stamp out in a generation or two the passing Spanish
adventure with independent thought.</p>
<p>3 . The Emperor Passes: 1556-58</p>
<p>On September 28, J556, Charles V made his final entry into Spain. At
Burgos he dismissed with rewards most of those who had attended him, and
took leave of his sisters, Mary of Hungary and Eleonora, widow of
Francis I. They wished to share his monastic retreat, but the rules
forbade it, and they took up their residence not too far from this
brother whom they alone now seemed to love. After suffering many
ceremonies en route, he reached the village of Juandilla in the valley
of Plasencia, some 120 miles west of Madrid. There he tarried several
months while workmen completed and furnished the accommodations that he
had ordered in the monastery of Yuste (St. Justus), six miles away. When
he made the last stage of his jour- ney (February 3, 1557) it was not to
a monastic cell but to a mansion spacious enough to house the more
intimate of his fifty servitors. The monks rejoiced to have so
distinguished a guest, but were chagrined to find that he had no
intention of sharing their regimen. He ate and drank as abundantly as
before — i.e., excessively. Sardine omelets, Estremadura sausages, eel
pies, pickled partridges, fat capons, and rivers of wine and beer
disappeared into</p>
<p>642 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>the Imperial paunch; and his physicians were obliged to prescribe
large quantities of senna and rhubarb to carry off the surplusage.</p>
<p>Instead of reciting rosaries, litanies, and psalms, Charles read or
dictated dispatches from or to his son, and offered him advice on every
aspect of war, theology, and government. In his final year he became a
merciless bigot; he recommended ferocious penalties to “cut out the
root” of heresy, and he regretted that he had allowed Luther to escape
him at Worms. He ordered that a hundred lashes should be laid upon any
woman who should approach within two bowshots of the monastery walls. 87
He revised his will to provide that 30,000 Masses should be said for the
repose of his soul. We should not judge him from those senile days; some
taint of insanity may have come down to him with his mother’s blood.</p>
<p>In August 1558, his gout developed into a burning fever. This
returned intermittently, and with rising intensity. For a month he was
racked with all the pains of death before he was allowed to die
(September 21, 1558). In 1574 Philip had the remains removed to the
Escorial, where they lie under a stately monument.</p>
<p>Charles V was the most impressive failure of his age, and even his
virtues were sometimes unfortunate for mankind. He gave peace to Italy,
but only after a decade of devastation, and by subjecting it and the
papacy to Spain; and the Italian Renaissance withered under that somber
mastery. He de- feated and captured Francis, but he lost at Madrid a
royal opportunity to make with him a treaty that could have saved all
faces and a hundred thou- sand lives. He helped to turn back Suleiman at
Vienna, and checked Barba- rossa in the Mediterranean. He strengthened
the Hapsburgs but weakened the Empire; he lost Lorraine and surrendered
Burgundy. The princes of Ger- many frustrated his attempt to centralize
authority there, and from his time the Holy Roman Empire was a decaying
tissue waiting for Napoleon to pronounce it dead. He failed in his
efforts to crush Protestantism in Ger- many, and his method of
repressing it in the Netherlands left a tragic legacy to his son. He had
found the German cities flourishing and free; he left them ailing under
a reactionary feudalism. When he came to Germany it was alive with ideas
and energy beyond any other nation in Europe; when he abdi- cated it was
spiritually and intellectually exhausted, and would lie fallow for two
centuries. In Germany and Italy his policies were a minor cause of de-
cline, but in Spain it was chiefly his action that crushed municipal
liberty and vigor. He might have saved England for the Church by
persuading Catherine to yield to Henry’s need for an heir; instead he
forced Clement into a ruinous vacillation.</p>
<p>And yet it is our hindsight that sees his mistakes and their
enormity; our historical sense can condone them as rooted in the
limitations of his mental</p>

<p>environment and in the harsh delusions of the age. He was the ablest
states- man among his contemporaries, but only in the sense that he
dealt coura- geously with the profoundest issues in their widest range.
He was a great man dwarf ed and shattered by the problems of his
time.</p>
<p>Two fundamental movements pervaded his long reign. The most funda-
mental was the growth of nationalism under centralized monarchies; in
this he did not share. The most dramatic was a religious revolution
rising out of national and territorial divisions and interests. Northern
Germany and Scandinavia accepted Lutheranism; southern Germany,
Switzerland, and the Lowlands divided into Protestant and Catholic
sections; Scotland became Calvinist Presbyterian, England became
Anglican Catholic or Cal- vinist Puritan. Ireland, France, Italy, Spain,
and Portugal remained loyal to a distant or chastened papacy. Yet amid
that double fragmentation a subtle integration grew: the proudly
independent states found themselves inter- dependent as never before,
increasingly bound in one economic web, and forming a vast theater of
interrelated politics, wars, law, literature, and art. The Europe that
our youth knew was taking form.</p>
