<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>Zwingli: The Reformation in</p>
<p>Switzerland</p>
<p>1477-1531</p>
<p>MULTUM IN P ARVO</p>
<p>T HE success of the Swiss cantons in repelling the assault of Charles
the Bold (1477) strengthened their Confederation, fired their pride
of</p>
<p>nationality, and steeled them to withstand the attempt of Maximilian
to sub- ject them in fact as well as in theory to the Holy Roman Empire.
Disputes over the division of the spoils after the defeat of Burgundy
brought the can- tons close to civil war; but at the Diet of Stans
(1481) a hermit philosopher, Nikolaus von der Flue — Bruder Klaus in
Swiss memory — persuaded them to peace.</p>
<p>Canton by canton the sturdy Confederation grew. Fribourg and
Solothurn were admitted in 1481, Basel and Schaffhausen in 1501,
Appenzell in 1513; now they were thirteen, all speaking German dialects,
except that French too was spoken in Fribourg and Bern. They formed a
federal republic: each canton regulated its internal affairs, but was
governed in its external relations by a common legislature. The single
chamber of this federal diet was com- posed of an equal number of
deputies from each canton. Democracy was not complete; several cantons
appropriated minor communities as voteless vassals. Nor was Switzerland
as yet a model lover of peace. In 1500-12 the cantons took advantage of
Italian disruption to seize Bellinzona, Locarno, Lugano, and other
regions south of the Alps; and they continued to lease Swiss legions —
with their consent — to foreign powers. But after the defeat of the
Swiss pikemen at Marignano (1515) the Confederation renounced
territorial expansion, adopted a policy of neutrality, and directed its
virile peasantry, its skillful artisans, and its resourceful merchants
in developing one of the most civilized civilizations in history.</p>
<p>The Church was as genial and corrupt in Switzerland as in Italy. She
gave patronage and considerable freedom to the humanists who gathered
around Froben and Erasmus at Basel. It was part of the moral tolerance
of the age that most Swiss priests enjoyed the services of concubines. 1
One Swiss bishop charged his clergy four guilders for every child born
to them, and in one</p>

<p>404</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>year garnered 1522 guilders from this source. 2 He complained that
many priests gambled, frequented taverns, and got drunk 3 — apparently
without paying an episcopal fee. Several cantons — Zurich in particular
— set up civic supervision of churchmen and taxed monastic properties.
The bishop of Constance claimed all Zurich as his feudal fief, and
demanded of it obedience and tithes; but the papacy was too enmeshed in
Italian politics to support his claims effectively. In 1510 Pope Julius
II, in return for some Genevese legions, agreed that the town council of
Geneva should regulate the mon- asteries, convents, and public morals
within its domain. 4 So, seven years be- fore Luther’s theses, the
essence of the Reformation was achieved in Zurich and Geneva — the
supremacy of secular over ecclesiastical authority. The path was cleared
for Zwingli and Calvin to establish their diverse mergers of Church and
state.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ZWINGLI</li>
</ol>
<p>A visit to the birthplace of Huldreich or Ulrich Zwingli suggests
the</p>
<p>not invariable rule that great men are born in small houses. The most
rational and unsuccessful of the Reformers began life (January 1, 1484)
in a tiny cottage in the mountain valley village of Wildhaus, fifty
miles southeast of Zurich, in the present canton of Saint-Gall. A low
gable roof, walls of heavy boards, little mullioned windows, floors of
massive planks, low ceil- ings, dark rooms, creaking stairs, sturdy beds
of oak, a table, a chair, a shelf for books: this historic home bespeaks
an environment in which natural selection was rigorous, and supernatural
selection seemed an indispensable hope. Ulrich’s father was chief
magistrate in that hidden hamlet, and his mother was the proud sister of
a priest. He was the third of eight sons, who competed for the
admiration of two sisters. From his boyhood he was des- tined for the
priesthood.</p>
<p>His uncle, dean of the church at near-by Wesen, shared with his
parents in his education, and gave Zwingli a humanistic bent and breadth
that sharply distinguished him from Luther and Calvin. At ten the boy
was sent to a Latin school at Basel; at fourteen he entered at Bern a
college headed by an outstanding native classicist; from sixteen to
eighteen he studied in the Uni - versity of Vienna in its humanist
heyday under Conrad Celtes. He lightened his labors by playing on the
lute, harp, violin, flute, and dulcimer. At eight- een he returned to
Basel, and took theology under Thomas Wyttenbach, who, as early as 1
508, attacked indulgences, clerical celibacy, and the Mass. At twenty-
two ( 1 506) Zwingli received his master’s degree, and was or - dained
priest. He celebrated his first Mass at Wildhaus amid joyful relatives,
and, with a hundred guilders raised for him, bought appointment 5 to a
pas- torate in Glarus, twenty miles away.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII) THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND 405</p>
<p>There, while zealously performing his duties, he continued his
studies. He taught himself Greek to read the New Testament in the
original. He read with enthusiasm Homer, Pindar, Democritus, Plutarch,
Cicero, Caesar, Livy, Seneca, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, and wrote a
commentary on the skeptical humorist Lucian. He corresponded with Pico
della Mirandola and Erasmus, called Erasmus “the greatest philosopher
and theologian,” visited him reverently (1515), and read him every night
as a prelude to sleep. Like Erasmus, he grew a sharp nose for
ecclesiastical corruption, a genial scorn for doctrinal bigotry, and an
ardent refusal to think of the classical philoso- phers and poets as
burning in hell. He vowed that he “would rather share the eternal lot of
a Socrates or a Seneca than that of a pope.” 6 He did not let his
sacerdotal vows exclude him from the pleasures of the flesh; he had some
affairs with generous women, and continued so to indulge himself until
his marriage (1514). His congregation did not seem to mind, and the
popes paid him, till 1520, an annual pension of fifty florins for
supporting them against the pro-French party in Glarus. In 1513 and 1 5
1 5 he accompanied the Glarus contingent of Swiss mercenaries to Italy
as their chaplain, and did his best to keep them faithful to the papal
cause; but his contact with war at the battles of Navarro and Marignano
turned him strongly against any further sale of Swiss valor to foreign
governments.</p>
<p>In 1516 the French faction in Glarus won the upper hand, and Zwingli
moved to a pastorate at Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. His
preaching there took a Protestant tinge even before Luther’s rebellion.
In 1517 he called for a religion based exclusively on the Bible, and he
told his arch- bishop, Cardinal Matthaus Schinner, that there was scant
warrant in Scripture for the papacy. In August 1 5 1 8, he attacked
abuses in the sale of indulgences, and persuaded Benedictine monks to
remove, from their lucrative shrine of the Virgin, an inscription
promising pilgrims “full remission of all sins in guilt and punishment
alike.” 7 Some pilgrims from Zurich brought to their pastors an
enthusiastic report of his preaching. On December 10, 1518, he accepted
a call to be vicar or “people’s priest” at the Grossmiinster, or Great
Minster, of Zurich, the most enterprising city in Switzerland.</p>
<p>He was now approaching maturity in morals and mind. He undertook a
series of sermons expounding, from the Greek text, all the New Testament
except the Apocalypse, which he disliked; he had little in him of the
mysti- cism that shared in forming Luther. We have no portrait of him
from life, but his contemporaries described him as a handsome,
ruddy-faced, full- blooded man, with a melodious voice that captured his
congregation. He did not rival Luther in eloquence or exegesis; yet his
sermons were so convincing in sincerity and clarity that soon all Zurich
responded to his influence. His ecclesiastical superiors supported him
when he resumed his campaign against the sale of indulgences. Bemhardin

<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>had crossed the Saint Gotthard Pass in August 1518, to become the
Tetzel of Switzerland. He offered Pope Leo’s indulgence to the rich on
parchment</p>
<p>In 1519 plague struck Zurich, taking a third of the population in
half a year. Zwingli stayed at his post, toiled night and day in the
care of the sick, caught the infection himself, and came close to death.
When he recovered he was the most popular figure in Zurich. Distant
dignitaries like Pirkheimer and Diirer sent him felicitations. In 1521
he was made head priest of the Grossmiinster. He was now strong enough
to proclaim openly the Ref- ormation in Switzerland.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE ZWINGLIAN REFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Almost unconsciously, but as a natural result of his unusual
education, he had changed the character of the pastorate in his church.
Before him the sermon had counted for little; Mass and communion had
been nearly all the service; Zwingli made the sermon dominate the
ritual. He became teacher as well as preacher; and as his confidence
grew he drove home ever more forcefully his conviction that Christianity
should be restored to its early simplicity of organization and worship.
He was deeply stirred by Luther’s revolt and writings, and by Huss’s
treatise On the Church. By 1520 he was publicly attacking monasticism,
purgatory, and the invocation of saints; furthermore, he argued that the
payment of tithes to the Church should be purely voluntary, as in
Scripture. His bishop begged him to withdraw these statements; he
persisted; and the cantonal council supported him by order- ing all
priests within its jurisdiction to preach only what they found in the
Bible. In 1521 Zwingli persuaded the council to forbid the enlistment of
Swiss soldiery by the French; a year later the prohibition was extended
to all foreign powers; and when Cardinal Schinner continued to recruit
Swiss troops for the pope, Zwingli pointed out to his congregation that
the Car- dinal wore a red hat not without reason, for “if it were wrung
you would see the blood of your nearest kindred drip from its folds.” 8
Finding no text in the Testament for the avoidance of meat in Lent, he
allowed his parishioners to ignore the Church’s rules for Lenten fasts.
The bishop of Constance pro- tested; Zwingli answered him in a book,
Archeteles (beginning and end), which predicted a universal rebellion
against the Church, and advised the prelates to imitate Caesar, fold
their garments about them, and die with grace and dignity. With ten
other priests he petitioned the bishop to end clerical</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) THE REFORMATION IN. SWITZERLAND 407</p>
<p>immorality by allowing sacerdotal marriage (1522). He was at this
time keeping Anna Reinhard as his mistress or secret wife. In 1524 he
publicly married her, a year before Luther’s marriage to Catherine von
Bora.</p>
<p>This definite rupture with the Church was preceded by two
disputations that recalled the Leipzig debate of Luther and Eck, and
distantly echoed the Scholastic disputations of the medieval
universities. As a semi-democratic republic, Switzerland was not shocked
by Zwingli’s suggestion that the dif - ferences between his views and
those of his conservative opponents should receive an open and impartial
hearing. The Great Council of Zurich, blithely assuming theological
jurisdiction, invited the bishops to send representatives. They came in
force, and altogether some 600 persons gathered for the ex- citing
contest in the city hall (January 25, 1523).</p>
<p>Zwingli offered to defend sixty-seven theses.</p>

<p>Johann Faber, Vicar-General of the diocese of Constance, refused to
dis- cuss these propositions in detail, claiming that they should be
laid before great universities or a general council of the Church.
Zwingli thought this unnecessary; now that the New Testament was
available in the vernaculars, all could have the Word of God to decide
these issues; that was enough. The Council agreed; it declared Zwingli
guiltless of heresy, and bade all</p>
<p>THE- REFORMATION</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Zurich clergymen to preach only what they could establish by
Scripture. Here, as in Lutheran Germany, the state took over the
Church.</p>
<p>Most priests — their salaries being now guaranteed by the state —
accepted the Council’s order. Many of them married, baptized in the
vernacular, neg~ lected the Mass, and abandoned the veneration of
images. A band of en- thusiasts began indiscriminately to destroy
pictures and statues in the churches of Zurich. Disturbed by the spread
of violence, Zwingli arranged a second disputation (October 26, 1523),
which was attended by 550 lay- men and 350 clergymen. The outcome was an
order of the Council that a committee including Zwingli should prepare a
booklet of doctrinal instruc- tion for the people, and that meanwhile
all violence should cease. Zwingli rapidly composed Eine kurze
Christliche Einleitung, which was sent to all the clergy of the canton.
The Catholic hierarchy protested, and the Diet of the Confederation,
meeting at Lucerne (January 26, 1524), seconded the protest, at the same
time pledging itself to ecclesiastical reform. The Council ignored the
protests.</p>
<p>Zwingli formulated his doctrine more amply in two Latin treatises: De
vera et falsa religione (1525) and Ratio fidei ( 1 5 3 o ) . He accepted
the basic theology of the Church — a triune God, the Fall of Adam and
Eve, the In- carnation, Virgin Birth, and Atonement; but he interpreted
“original sin” not as a taint of guilt inherited from our “first
parents,” but as an unsocial tendency inherent in the nature of man. 10
He agreed with Luther that man can never earn salvation by good works,
but must believe in the redeeming efficacy of Christ’s sacrificial
death. He agreed with Luther and Calvin on pred estination: every event,
and therefore every individual’s eternal fate, has been foreseen by God,
and must occur as so foreseen. But God has fated for damnation only
those who reject the Gospel offered them. All children (of Christian
parents) who die in infancy are saved, even if unbaptized, for they were
too young to sin. Hell is real, but purgatory is “a figment . . . a
lucrative business for its authors”; Scripture knows nothing of it. 11
The sacraments are not miraculous vehicles, but useful symbols, of
divine grace. Auricular confession is unnecessary; no priest — only God
— can forgive sin; but it is often beneficial to confide our spiritual
troubles to a priest. 12 The Lord’s Supper is no actual eating of the bo
dy of Christ, but a symbol of the union of the soul with God, and of the
individual with the Christian com- munity.</p>
<p>Zwingli kept the Eucharist as part of the Reformed service, and
ad-</p>
<p>ministered it in both bread and wine, but he offered it only four
times a year. In that occasional celebration much of the Mass was
retained, but it was recited in Swiss German by congregation and priest.
During the remainder of the year the Mass was replaced by the sermon;
the appeal of ritual to the senses and the imagination was subordinated
to the appeal of discourse to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND 409</p>
<p>mind — a rash gamble on popular intelligence and the stability of
ideas. Since an infallible Bible had now to substitute for an infallible
Church as a guide to doctrine and conduct, Luther’s German translation
of the New Testa - ment was adapted to the Swiss German dialect, and a
corps of scholars and divines, led by the saintly Leo Jud, was
commissioned to prepare a German version of the entire Bible. This was
published by Christian Froschauer at Zurich in 1534, four years before
Luther’s better version appeared.</p>
<p>In faithful obedience to the Second Commandment, and signalizing the
return of Protestant Christianity to its early Jewish traditions, the
Zurich Council ordered the removal of all religious images, relics, and
ornaments from the churches of the city; even the organs were banished,
and the im- mense interior of the Grossmiinster was left dismally bare,
as it is today. Some of the images were absurd enough, some lent
themselves so readily to superstition as to merit destruction; but some
were sufficiently beautiful to make Zwingli’s successor, Heinrich
Bullinger, mourn their loss. Zwingli him- self had a tolerant attitude
toward images that were not worshiped as won- der-working idols, 13 but
he condoned the demolition as a reproof to idolatry. 14 Village churches
in the canton were allowed to keep their images if a majority of the
congregation so desired. Catholics retained some civic rights, but were
ineligible to public office. Attendance at Mass was punish- able by a
fine; eating fish instead of meat on Friday was forbidden by law. 15
Monasteries and nunneries (with one exception) were closed or turned
into hospitals or schools; monks and nuns emerged from the cloister into
marriage. Saints’ days were abolished, and pilgrimages, holy water, and
Masses for the dead disappeared. Though not all these changes were
consummated by 1524, yet the Reformation was by that time far more
advanced in Zwingli and Zurich than in Luther and Wittenberg; Luther
then was still a celibate monk, and still said Mass.</p>
<p>In November 1524, Zurich formed a Privy Council (Heimliche Rath)</p>
<p>of six members to prepare settlements of urgent or delicate problems
of gov- ernment. Between Zwingli and this Council a working compromise
took form: he surrendered to it the regulation of ecclesiastical as well
as secular affairs, and in both fields it followed his lead. Church and
state in Zurich became one organization, of which Zwingli was unofficial
head, and in which the Bible was accepted (like the Koran in Islam) as
the first source and final test of law. In Zwingli, as later in Calvin,
the Old Testament ideal of the prophet guiding the state was
realized.</p>
<p>So quickly and completely successful in Zurich, Zwingli turned an ac-
quisitive eye upon the Catholic cantons, and wondered whether all
Switzer- land might not be won to the new form of the old faith.</p>

<li>ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Reformation had split the Confederation, and seemed destined to
destroy it. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, Appenzell, and the Grisons
favored Zurich; the other cantons were hostile. Five cantons — Lucerne,
Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug — formed a Catholic League to suppress
all Hussite, Lutheran, and Zwinglian movements (1524). Archduke
Ferdinand of Aus- tria urged all Catholic states to united action,
promised his aid, and doubtless hoped to restore the Hapsburg power in
Switzerland. On July 16 all the cantons except Schaffhausen and
Appenzell agreed to exclude Zurich from future federal diets. Zurich and
Zwingli responded by sending missionaries into the Thorgau district to
proclaim the Reformation. One of these was arrested; friends rescued
him, and led a wild crowd that sacked and burned a monastery, and
destroyed images in several churches (July 1524). Three of the leaders
were executed, and a martial spirit rose on both sides. Erasmus, timid
in Basel, was alarmed to see pious worshipers, aroused by their preach-
ers, come out of church “like men possessed, with ang er and rage
painted on their faces . . . like warriors animated by their general to
some mighty at- tack.” 16 Six cantons threatened to leave the
Confederation if Zurich were not chastised.</p>
<p>Zwingli, enjoying his new role of war leader, advised Zurich to
increase its army and arsenal, to seek alliance with France, to build a
fire behind Ferdinand by fomenting revolution in Tirol, and to promise
Thorgau and Saint-Gall the properties of their monasteries in return for
their support. To the Catholic League he offered peace on three
conditions: that it yield to Zurich the famous abbey of St. Gall; that
it renounce the Austrian alliance; and that it surrender to Zurich the
Lucerne satirist Thomas Murner, who had written too pungendy of the
Reformers. The League scorned these terms. Zurich ordered its
representatives in Saint-Gall to seize the abbey; they obeyed (January
28, 1529). In February the tension was raised by events in Basel.</p>
<p>The Protestant leader in that “Athens of Switzerland” was Johann es
Hausschein, who had Hellenized his name, meaning house lamp, into Oeco-
lampadius. He wrote Latin poetry at twelve, mastered Greek soon after-
ward, and rose to rank second only to Reuchlin as a Hebraist. In his
pulpit at St. Martin’s Church and in his chair of theology at the
university, he made a name for himself as a reformer and moralist,
humane in everything but religion. By 152 1 he was attacking the abuses
of the confessional, the doctrine of transubstantiation, the idolatry of
the Virgin. In 1523 Luther acclaimed him. In 1525 he adopted the
Zwinglian program, including the prosecution of Anabaptists. But he
rejected predestination; salus nostra ex Deo, he taught,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND 4II</p>
<p>perditio nostra ex nobis — u Our salvation comes from God, our
damnation from ourselves.” 17 When the Basel Council, now predominantly
Protestant,</p>
<p>On February 8, 1529, 800 men, assembled in the church of the
Franciscans, sent to the Council a demand that the Mass should be
forbidden, that all Catholics should be dismissed from office, and that
a more democratic consti- tution should be put in force. The Council
deliberated. On the following day the petitioners came in arms to the
market place. When by noon the Council had still reached no decision,
the crowd moved into the churches with hammers and axes, and destroyed
all discoverable religious images. 18 Erasmus described the affair in a
letter to Pirkheimer:</p>
<p>The smiths and workmen removed the pictures from the churches,</p>
<p>and heaped such insults upon the images of the saints and the
crucifix itself, that it is quite surprising there was no miracle,
seeing how many always used to occur whenever the saints were even
slightly of-</p>
<p>fended. Not a statue was left either in the churches, or the
vestibules, or the porches, or the monasteries. The frescoes were
obliterated by means of a coating of lime. Whatever would bum was thrown
into the fire, and the rest was pounded into fragments. Nothing was
spared</p>
<p>for love or money. 19</p>
<p>The Council took the hint, and voted full abolition of the Mass.
Erasmus, Beatus Rhenanus, and nearly all professors in the university
left Basel. Oeco- lampadius, triumphant, survived the outbreak by only
two years, dying soon after Zwingli’s death. ’</p>
<p>In May 1529, a Protestant missionary from Zurich, attempting to
preach in the city of Schwyz, was burned at the stake. Zwingli persuaded
the Zurich Council to declare war. He drew up the plan of campaign, and
led the can- ton’s troops in person. At Kappel, ten miles south of
Zurich, they were</p>

<p>freedom for Protestant preaching in Catholic cantons. He predicted an
early rupture of the peace.</p>
<p>It lasted twenty-eight months. In the interim an effort was made to
unite the Protestants of Switzerland and Germany. Charles V had patched
up his quarrel with Clement VII; both were now free to join forces
against the Protestants. But these were already a powerful political
force. Half of Ger- many was Lutheran; many German cities — Ulm,
Augsburg, Wiirttemberg, Mainz, Frankfurt-am-Main, Strasbourg — had
strong Zwinglian sympathies; and in Switzerland, though the rural
districts were Catholic, most of the towns were Protestant. Obviously
self-protection against the Empire and the papacy required Protestant
unity. Only theology stood in the way.</p>
<p>Philip, Landgrave of Hesse, took the initiative by inviting Luther,
Mel- anchthon, and other German Protestants to meet Zwingli,
Oecolampadius, and other Swiss Protestants in his castle at Marburg,
north of Frankfurt. On September 29, 1519, the rival factions met.
Zwingli made generous conces- sions; he dispelled Luther’s suspicion t
hat he doubted the divinity of Christ; he accepted the Nicene Creed, and
the dogma of original sin. But he would not withdraw his view of the
Eucharist as a symbol and commemoration rather than a miracle. Luther
chalked on the conference table the words ascribed to Christ — “This is
my body”— and would admit none but a literal interpretation. On fourteen
articles the parties signed an agreement; on the Eucharist they parted
(October 3), and not amicably. Luther refused Zwingli’s proffered hand,
saying, “Your spirit is not our spirit”; he drew up a theological
profession in seventeen articles, including “consubstantiation,” and
persuaded the Lutheran princes to reject alliance with any group that
would not sign all sev enteen. 20 Melanchthon agreed with his master.
“We told the Zwinglians,” he wrote, “that we wondered how their
consciences would allow them to call us brethren when they held that our
doctrine was erroneous”; 21 here in one sentence is the spirit of the
age. In 1532 Luther admonished Duke Albrecht of Prussia not to allow any
Zwinglian in his territory, on pain of everlasting damnation. It was too
much to ask of Luther that he should pass at one step from the Middle
Ages into modernity; he had received too profound an impress of medieval
religion to bear pa- tiently with any repudiation of its fundamentals;
he felt, like a good Catholic, that his world of thought would collapse,
the whole meaning of life would fade away, if he lost any basic element
of the faith in which he had been formed. Luther was the most medieval
of modern men.</p>
<p>Crushed with this failure, Zwingli returned to a Zurich that was
becoming restless under his dictatorship. Strict sumptuary laws were
resented; trade was hampered by the religious differences among the
cantons; artisans were dissatisfied with their still small voice in the
government, and Zwingli’s ser - mons, cluttered with politics, had lost
their inspiration and charm. He felt</p>
<p>CHAP, XVIIl) THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND 4H</p>
<p>the change so keenly that he asked the Council’s leave to seek a
pastorate</p>
<p>He gave much of his time now to writing. In 1530 he sent his Ratio
fidet to Charles V, who gave no sign of receiving it. In 1531 he
addressed to Francis I a Christianae fidei brevis et clara expositio. In
this “brief and clear exposition of the Christian faith” he expressed
his Erasmian conviction that a Christian, on reaching paradise, would
find there many noble Jews and pagans: not only Adam, Abraham, Isaac,
Moses, Isaiah . . . but Hercules, Theseus, Socrates, Aristides, Numa,
Camillus, the Catos, the Scipios; “in short, there has not been any good
man, nor any holy mind, nor any faithful soul, from the very beginning
of the world even to its end, whom you will not see there with God. What
could be imagined more joyful, pleasing, and noble, than this sight?” 22
This passage so shocked Luther that he concluded that Zw ingli must have
been a “heathen”; 23 and Bishop Bossuet, agreeing for once with Luther,
quoted it to prove that Zwingli had been a hopeless infidel. 24</p>
<p>On May 15, 1 53 1, an assembly of Zurich and her allies voted to
compel the Catholic cantons to allow freedom of preaching in their
territory. When the cantons refused, Zwingli proposed war, but his
allies preferred an economic blockade. The Catholic cantons, denied all
imports, declared war. Again rival armies marched; again Zwingli led the
way and carried the standard; again the armies met at Kappel (October
11,1531) — the Catholics with 8,000 men, the Protestants with 1,500.
This time they fought. The Catholics won, and Zwingli, aged forty-seven,
was among the 500 Zurichers slain. His body was quartered and then
burned on a pyre of dung. 25 Luther, hearing of Zwingli’s death,
pronounced it the judgment of heaven on a heathen, 26 and “a triumph for
us.” 27 “I wish from my heart,” he is reported to have said, “that
Zwingli could be saved, but I fear for the contrary, for Christ has said
that those who deny Him shall be damned.” 28</p>
<p>Zwingli was succeeded in Zurich by Heinrich Bullinger, and at
Basel</p>
<p>Oswald Myconius carried on after Oecolampadius’ death. Bulli nger
avoided politics, superintended the city’s schools, sheltered fugitive
Protestants, and</p>
<p>Despite that protective accord, Catholicism regained in later years
much of its lost ground in Switzerland, partly through its victory at
Kappel; the-</p>

<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>ologies are proved or disproved in history by competitive slaughter
or fertil- ity. Seven cantons adhered to Catholicism — Lucerne, Uri,
Schwyz, Zug, Unterwalden, Fribourg, and Solothurn; four were definitely
Protestant — Zurich, Basel, Bern, and Schaffhausen; the rest remained
poised between the two faiths, uncertain of their certainties. Zwingli’s
successor at Glarus, Val - entin Tschudi, compromised by saying Mass in
the morning for Catholics, and preaching an evangelical — purely
Scriptural — sermon in the evening for the Protestants; he argued for
mutual toleration, and was tolerated; he wrote a Chronicle so impartial
that no one could tell from it which faith he favored. Even in that age
there were Christians.</p>
