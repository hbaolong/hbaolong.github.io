Mind</h4>
<p>I. THE WORD INDUSTRY</p>
<p>T HE French language had now become the second tongue of every ed-
ucated European, the accepted medium of international diplomacy.
Frederick the Great used it regularly, except to his troops; Gibbon
wrote his first book in French, and for a time thought of writing in
French his history of declining Rome. In 1784 the Berlin Academy
announced a prize competition. for an essay explaining the causes of
this pre-eminence, and issued its own publications in French. The chief
causes were the political supremacy of France under Louiv XIV, the
spread of the French language by French troops in the Netherlands,
Germany, Austria, and Spain, the un- questioned superiority of French
literature on the Continent (England had reservations), the popularity
of Parisian society as the finishing school of the European elite, the
desire to replace Latin with a more modern and flexible speech in the
commerce of nations, and the purification and stand- ardization of the
French language by the French Academy through its Dictionary. Nowhere
had any vernacular reached such precision and variety, such point and
charm of phrase, such elegance and clarity of style. There were some
losses in this victory: French prose sacrificed the simple directness of
Montaigne, the rough and hearty vitality of Rabelais; French poetry
languished in the prison of Boileau’s rules. The Academy itself, until
Duclos aroused it after his election in 1746, had slipped into dreamy
formalism and cautious mediocrity.</p>
<p>The relative freedom of thought and speech under the Regency had en-
couraged the multiplication of authors, publishers, and libraries.
Printer- publisher-booksellers lurked everywhere, even though, as the
century ad- vanced, their trade became perilous; in Paris alone there
were 360, nearly all of them poor. Many towns now had circulating
libraries, and many libraries maintained reading rooms open to the
public for an admission fee of forty sous. Authorship seldom sufficed as
a way of life; it was usually appended to some other occupation; so the
elder Crebillon was a notary’s clerk, and Rousseau copied music. A few
famous writers could sell their product at a good price; Marivaux,
ruined by the collapse of Law’s System, retrieved his finances with his
plays and Marianne, and Rousseau, usually poor, received</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>X324</p>
<p>five thousand livres for Smile. The only copyright available was the
privi- lege du roi, or royal permission to publish; this protected the
author against the pirating of his book in France, but not against its
piratical printing abroad; it was granted only to manuscripts guaranteed
by official censors to contain nothing offensive to Church or state. New
ideas could surmount that barrier only through disguising their subject
matter or their heresies. This ruse failing, an author might send his
manuscript to Amsterdam, The Hague, Geneva, or some other foreign city,
to be printed there in French, distributed abroad, and circulated
clandestinely in France.</p>
<p>The expansion of the middle class, the spread of education, and the
gathering of intellect in Paris were generating an audience eager for
books, and a swarm of authors rose to saturate this demand. The
weakening of the state under Louis XV, and the decline of religious
belief, stimulated the oral and written discussion of political and
philosophical issues. The aristocracy, resenting both the monarchy that
had shorn it of power and the Church that was supporting the monarchy,
offered an interested hearing to criticism of the government and the
creed; and the upper middle class joined in this receptivity, hoping for
a change that would give them social equality with the nobility.</p>
<p>In this new atmosphere authors attained a status rarely accorded them
either before or after the eighteenth century. They were welcomed in the
salons, where they held forth with all the facility of their eloquence;
they were received in titled homes so long as they stepped upon no
titled toes; they were entertained and sometimes housed by financiers
like La Popelin- iere. Despite their poverty they became a force in the
state. “Of all em - pires,” said Duclos in 1751, “that of the men of
mind [ gens d’ esprit ], with- out being visible, is most widely spread.
Men of power can command, but men of intellect govern; for in the long
run… public opinion sooner or later overcomes or upsets every form of
despotism.” 1 (The technique of forming public opinion by money or
government had not yet been per- fected in 1751.)</p>
<p>Cheered on by a widening audience, stimulated by hundreds of alert
competitors, liberated by the decline of dogma, spurred by the vanity of
print, French writers now launched upon the inky sea such a flotilla of
let- ters, pamphlets, brochures, diatribes, essays, memoirs, histories,
novels, dramas, poems, theologies, philosophies, and pornography as
finally broke through all the chains of censorship, swept away all
resistance, and trans- formed the mind, the faith, and the government of
France and, in some measure, of the world. Never in literature had there
been such subtle wit, such delicate pleasantry, such coarse buffoonery,
such lethal ridicule. Every orthodoxy of Church or state trembled under
the assault of these sharply pointed, sometimes poisoned, usually
nameless, pens.</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>325</p>
<p>Even private correspondence became a public art. Men and women re-
vised, rewrote, polished their letters in the hope that these would
shine be- fore more eyes than two; and sometimes they succeeded so well
that their letters became belles-lettres, literature. Loving
conversation, they talked on paper to absent friends or enemies with all
the naturalness of face-to-face speech, all the sparkle and vitality of
exchanges across the table in salons. Such letters were no mere trivia
of personal news; they were in many cases discourses on politics,
literature, or art. Sometimes they were in verse — vers de societe —
bubbling with the rhymes that come so readily in French, and warm with
the hope of praise. So Voltaire delighted his friends with episto- lary
poems poured from the cornucopia of his agile mind and facile art.</p>
<p>The age of oratory was ending, for eighteenth-century France feared
to be bored, even by a Bossuet; it would return with the Revolution.
Memoirs were still in fashion, for, being letters to posterity, they
kept some of the charm of correspondence. It was at the end of this
period, in 1755, that the Memoir es of the Baronne de Staal de Launay,
who had died in 1750, at last reached print, recalling the days of the
Regency and the soirees de Sceaux; here, said Grimm, was a lady who
rivaled Voltaire himself in the excellence of her prose. 2</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE STAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>The theaters surpassed the salons in the place they held in the life
and affection of Paris. “The theater,” said Voltaire to Marmontel in
1745, “is the most enchanting of all careers. It is there that in one
day you may ob- tain glory and fortune. One successful piece renders a
man at the same time rich and celebrated.” 3 There were good theaters in
the provinces, there</p>
<p>All these theaters, and the Opera in the Palais-Royal, were spacious
el- lipses, with several tiers of boxes or seats for the perfumed few;
less aromatic spectators stood in the “parterre” (i.e., on the ground),
which we misname the orchestra; no seats were placed there till the
Revolution. As many as 1 50 extra-paying fops or devotees sat on the
stage, surrounding the action on three sides. Voltaire denounced this
custom as hampering the players and destroying the illusion. “Hence it
arises that most of our plays are noth - ing but long discourses; all
theatrical action is lost, or, if practiced, appears</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xridiculous.” 4 How, he asked, could a dramatist represent on such a
stage such a scene as Brutus and then Antony addressing the Roman
populace after Caesar’s assassination? Ho w could the poor Ghost in
Hamlet peek through these privileged anatomies? Hardly any of
Shakespeare’s plays could be presented under such conditions. 5
Voltaire’s vigorous protests, seconded by Diderot and others, finally
had effect, and by 1759 the stages of the French theaters were
cleared.</p>
<p>Voltaire had less success in his campaign to improve the theological
status of actors. Socially their condition had improved; they were
received in aris- tocratic homes, and in many cases they played at royal
command. But the Church still condemned the theater as a school for
scandal, held all actors to be ipso facto excommunicated, and forbade
their burial in consecrated ground — which included every cemetery in
Paris. Voltaire pointed the con- tradiction:</p>
<p>Actors are paid wages by the King, and excommunicated by the</p>
<p>Church; they are ordered by the King to play every evening, and for-
bidden to play at all by the ritual. If they do not play they are put
into prison [as happened when His Majesty’s Players went on strike];
if</p>
<p>hey play they are [at death] cast into the sewers. We delight to live
with them, and object to be buried with them; we admit them to our
tables, and close our cemeteries to them. 6</p>
<p>Adrienne Lecouvreur, the greatest French actress of her time,
illustrated these antitheses in her life and death. Born near Reims in
1692, she came to Paris at the age of ten. Living near the
Theatre-Frangais, she found her way into it frequently, and imitated at
home the tragediennes whom she admired from the parterre. At fourteen
she organized a company of ama- teurs, which performed on private
stages. The actor Le Grand gave her lessons, and secured a place for her
in a troupe acting in Strasbourg. For years, like Moliere, she played in
the provinces, passing from role to role, and doubtless from one romance
to another. Longing for love, she found only lechers; two of them in
succession left her pregnant and refused her marriage; at eighteen she
bore a daughter, at twenty-four another. By 1715 she was back in Paris,
for young Voltaire met her there and then, and was for a time something
more than a friend. 7 In 1717 she was the leading lady at the
Theatre-Fran9ais, the haunt and aspiration of her youth.</p>
<p>Like many famous actresses, she was not particularly beautiful; she
was rather stout, and her features were irregular. But she had an
indescribable grace in carriage and manners, a seductive music in her
voice, a light of fire and feeling in her dark eyes, a mobile and noble
expression in her face; her every action expressed personality. She
refused to follow the oratorical style of speech that had been made
traditional in French acting by the long,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>3*7</p>
<p>rectangular form of the early theaters; she resolved to act her part
and speak her lines as naturally on the boards as in real life, except
for the distinct articulation and added volume of voice needed to carry
her words to the farthest auditors. In her brief career she accomplished
a revolution in his- trionic art. This was founded also in her depth of
feeling, her capacity to convey the passion and tenderness of love, the
full pathos or terror of a tragic scene. She excelled in the difficult
art of listening actively and ex- pressively while others spoke.</p>
<p>Old men praised her, youths lost their hearts and wits over her.
Young Charles Augustin de Ferriol, Comte d’Argental, who was to be the
“angel” and agent of Voltaire, developed for her an ardor that alarmed
his mother, who, fearing that he would propose marriage and be accepted,
vowed to send him to the colonies. When Adrienne heard of this she wrote
to Mme. de Ferriol (March 22, 1721) assuring her that she would
discourage the youth’s addresses:</p>
<p>I will write to him whatever you please. I will never see him
again</p>
<p>if you desire it. But do not threaten to send him to the end of
the</p>
<p>world. He can be useful to his country; he can be the delight of
his</p>
<p>friends; he will crown you with satisfaction and fame; you have only
to guide his talents and let his virtues act. 8</p>
<p>She was right; d’Argental rose to be a councilor of the Parlement of
Paris. In his eighty-fifth year, going through the papers his mother had
left, he came upon this letter, of which he had known nothing
before.</p>
<p>Adrienne in her turn experienced all the rapture and desolation of
love and rejection. Often to her performances came the young Prince
Maurice of Saxony, not yet swollen with victories, but so handsome and
romantic that when he pledged her his lifelong devotion she thought that
this was the hero she had long awaited. (When it comes to pledging
lifelong devo- tion men have as many lives as a cat.) She accepted him
as her lover (1721), and for a time they lived in such cooing fidelity
that Paris compared them to La Fontaine’s amorous turtledoves. But the
young soldier, already a marechal de camp, dreamed of kingdoms; we have
seen him running off to Kurland to seek a crown, half financed by
Adrienne’s savings.</p>
<p>She consoled herself in his absence by establishing a salon. It was
not without intellectual profit that she had learned the elegance of
Racine and the ideas of Moliere; she had become one of the best-educated
women in France. Her friends were not casual admirers, but men and women
who liked her mind. Fontenelle, Voltaire, d’Argental, the Comte de
Caylus came regularly to her dinners; and some titled ladies were glad
to join that spar- kling company.</p>
<p>In 1728 the defeated soldier of fortune returned to Paris. Absence
had</p>

<p>Xcooled his glands; he discovered that Adrienne was four years his
senior, being now thirty-six; and a dozen rich women were offering to
share his bed. One of them was almost as royal as himself, Louise de
Lorraine, Duch- esse de Bouillon, granddaughter of Poland’s noble hero
Jan Sobieski. She paraded Maurice so boldly in her box at the
Theatre-Fran§ais that Adrienne faced that box when, with some emphasis,
she recited angry lines from Racine’s Phedre:</p>
<p>Je ne mis point de ces femmes hardies</p>
<p>Qui, portant dans le crime une tranquille paix,</p>
<p>Ont m se faire un front qui ne rough jamais 9</p>
<p>—“I am not one of those brazen women who, bringing into crime a [show
of] tranquil peace, have learned to put on a front that never blushes
with shame.”</p>
<p>In July, 1729, Simeon Bouret, abbe and painter of miniatures,
informed Mile. Lecouvreur that two masked agents of a court lady had
proposed to him to give the actress some poisoned pills, for which
service he was to re- ceive 6,600 livres. Adrienne notified the police.
They arrested the abbe and questioned him severely, but he persisted in
his story. She wrote a charac- teristic letter to the lieutenant of
police, asking him to free the abbe:</p>
<p>I have talked with him and made him talk often and for a long time,
and he always answered connectedly and intelligently. It is not that I
wish what he said to be true; I have a hundred times more reason to wish
he may be crazy. Ah, would to God I had only to solicit his par-</p>
<p>don! But if he is innocent, think, monsieur, what an interest I ought
to take in his fate, and how cruel this uncertainty is to me. Do not
con- sider my profession or my birth; deign to see my soul, which is
sincere and laid bare in this letter. 10</p>
<p>The Due de Bouillon, however, insisted that the abbe should be
detained. He was released several months later, still adhering to his
story. We do not yet know if it was true.</p>
<p>In February, 1730, Mile. Lecouvreur began to suffer from a diarrhea
that grew daily worse. She continued her roles at the theater, but early
in March she had to be carried from the theater in a faint. On March 15,
with her last strength, she played Jocaste in Voltaire’s Oedipe. On the
seventeenth she took to her bed, bleeding mortally from severe
inflammation of the bowels. The Marechal no longer came to her; only
Voltaire and d’Argental at - tended her in this tragic and humiliating
end. She died on March 20 in Voltaire’s arms.*</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1849 Eugene Scribe and Ernest Legouve produced in Paris their
successful but not quite accurate drama, Adrienne Lecouvreur ; and in
1902 Francesco Cilea composed an opera on the same theme.</li>

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>

<p>Since she had refused the last rites of the Church, 11 canon law
forbade her burial in consecrated ground. A friend engaged two
torchbearers to take her body in a hackney coach and bury her
clandestinely on the banks of the Seine, in what became the Rue de
Bourgogne. (In that same year 1730 Anne Oldfield, an English actress,
was buried with public honors in West- minster Abbey.) Voltaire wrote
(1730) a poem, La Mort de Mademoiselle Lecouvreur, passionately
denouncing the indignity of this burial.</p>
<p>Tons les coeurs sont emus de ma douleur mortelle,</p>
<p>J’entends de tous cotes les beaux-arts eperdus</p>
<p>S’ eerier en pleurant, “ Melpomene 12’ est plus!”</p>

<p>Honore par nos chants, consacre par tes mdnes,</p>
<p>Est pour nous un temple nouveau !*</p>
<p>The greatest dramatist of this period was, of course, Voltaire. He
had many rivals, among them Prosper Jolyot de Crebillon, an old survival
who should have been long since dead. From 1 705 to 1 7 1 1 Crebillon
had produced successful plays; then, convinced by the decided failure of
his Xerxes (1714) and Semiramis (1717) that he was through, he had
retired from authorship, and fallen into a poverty consoled in his
garret by his tender collection of ten dogs, fifteen cats, and some
ravens. In 1 745 Mme. de Pom- padour rescued him with a pension and a
sinecure, and arranged for an edi- tion of his collected works to be
published by the government press. He came to Versailles to thank her;
ill, she received him while she remained in her bed; as he bent to kiss
her hand Louis XV entered. “Madame,” cried the septuagenarian, “I am
undone; the King has surprised us together.” 12 Louis enjoyed this flash
of wit, and joined Pompadour in urging him to complete # “All hearts are
moved like mine by mortal grief. I hear on every side the distracted
arts</p>
<p>33 »</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhis abandoned play on Catiline. She and the court attended and
applauded the premiere (1748), and Crebillon again thrilled with fame
and francs. In 1754, a g e d eighty, he produced his last play- He
survived eight years more, happy with his animals.</p>
<p>Voltaire did not enjoy this appearance of a competitor from the
grave. But he had also to face, in comedy, the rivalry of the versatile
and effer- vescent Marivaux. Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux
became a satirist when, by chance, he saw his seventeen-year-old
sweetheart practicing her seductive charms before a mirror. His heart
was only momentarily sprained, for his father was the rich director of
the mint at Riom, and many a young lady yearned to be Pierre’s wife. He
married for love, and surprised Paris by leading a life of sexual
sobriety. He joined the salon of Mme. de Tencin, and may have learned
there the gay wit, elegant phrasing, and subtle feeling that went into
the marivaudage of his plays.</p>
<p>His first success was Arlequin poli par /’ amour, which ran for
twelve suc - cessive nights at the Theatre des Italiens in 1720. Just as
he was sipping his royalties he lost most of his money in the crash of
Law’s bank. We are told that he retrieved his fortune with his pen, 13
writing a long succession of comedies that amused Paris with their
graceful badinage and clever plots. The most famous of them, Le Jeu de T
amour et du hasard ( The Game of Love and Chance ) , turned on the
simultaneous but unconcerted resolve of two couples to test the devotion
of their as-yet-unseen fiance (e)s by an exchange of garb and manner
between master and man, mistress and maid, developing through a
concatenation of coincidences as absurd as Desde- mona’s handkerchief.
The women of Paris were better pleased than the men with the love
tangles in these plays, and their tender sentiment. Here too, as in
Versailles and the salons, as in Watteau and Boucher, woman ruled, and
had the deciding word; and the analysis of feeling replaced the prob-
lems of politics and the heroics of war. The masculine comedy of Moliere
gave way before the feminine comedy that ruled the French stage (barring
Beaumarchais) to the days of Scribe, Dumas fils, and Sardou.</p>

<li>THE FRENCH NOVEL</li>
</ol>
<p>It was this same Marivaux who gave a new form to the novel in France.
In 1731 he published Part I of La Vie de Marianne. It was well received;
he continued to offer further installments until 1741, when there were
eleven; he left it unfinished (though he survived till 1763) because his
aim had been not so much to tell a tale as to analyze character,
particularly in woman, especially in love. Nothing could be more
arresting than the open- ing scene: a band of robbers hold up a
stagecoach, and kill everybody in it</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>331</p>
<p>except Marianne, who survives to tell the story in her old age. The
heroine and supposed author keeps her intriguing anonymity to the end;
she trans- mits the manuscript to a friend with the caution, “Do not
forget that you have promised never to say who I am; I wish to be known
only to you.” 14</p>
<p>As her parents were among the casualties, Marianne is brought up by a
charitable bourgeoise, becomes a salesgirl in a lingerie shop, and
swells into charms that arouse M. de Climal. He brings her small gifts,
then costly gifts, and soon asks for her person as his reward. She
rejects him, and sends back his presents after some hesitations which
Marivaux describes with delicate understanding. We should have said that
meanwhile she had met Climal’s nephew, M. de Valville, who has less
money than his uncle, but also less years. Valville, however, keeps
Marianne in suspense for a thousand pages, and goes off with another
woman; at which point Marivaux’s story ends.</p>
<p>This was the outstanding psychological novel of eighteenth-century
France, to be rivaled only by Choderlos de Laclos’ Liaisons dangereuses
( 1 782 ). It recalled Mme. de La Fayette’s Princesse de Cleves (1678),
hardly equaled it in delicacy of feeling or beauty of style, but
surpassed it in the dissection of motive and sentiment. Here is a woman
who, like Richard- son’s Pamela, preserves her honor, but for its
marketable worth; she knows that women have only frail and perishable
values to offer for the monoga- mous support of the polygamous male. It
is a subtler picture than Richard- son’s. Pamela (1740) was begun nine
years after Marianne , and may have been influenced by it; in return
Richardson’s Clarissa (1747) helped Rous - seau’s La Nouvelle
Helo’ise.</p>
<p>Marivaux reflected the sturdy and cautious morals of the middle
class; Crebillon fils found his interest in the reckless license of the
aristocracy. Known as “Crebillon le gai” in contrast to his father,
“Crebillon le tra - gique” (who called his son the worst of his many
productions), Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crebillon grew up in the Paris of
the Regency, whose morals quite outweighed his Jesuit education. For
several years he shared his father’s garret, ravens, dogs, and cats. In
1734, aged twenty -seven, he achieved fame by his novel Vfscumoire — T
he Surface-Skimmer; this might have been the title of all his heroes and
books, for in them love, as Chamfort put it, is merely the “contact of
two skins.” 15 The story was laid in Japan, but it was so transparent a
satire on Church and state in France, and on the tiny Duchesse du Maine
(“the Fairy Cucumber”), that Cardinal Fleury banished him from Paris for
five years.</p>
<p>Returning, the author issued in 1740 his most notorious novel, Le
Sopha , which earned him a briefer banishment. The scene was Agra, but
the morals were Parisian. The “sultan” is bored, and calls for stories.
The young cour - tier Amanzei obliges by telling how, in a previous
incarnation, he had been a sofa; and he recalls some of the sins that
had tested his springs. The sue-</p>
<p>332 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xcession of adulteries is increasingly detailed. Crebillon took
special delight in the story of Almahide and Mochles, who, after verbose
boasting of their chastity, confess that their thoughts are as unchaste
as other people’s con - duct; they conclude that there could be no
greater guilt in the action than in the thought; whereupon they suit the
deed to the word. This, however, was an exceptional case; Crebillon’s
women usually require some financial quid for their quo; so Amina
counted her quid carefully, and “complied with her lover’s desire only
after she had made quite sure that he had not blundered in his
arithmetic.” 16</p>
<p>The book had its calculated success, and found readers in many lan-
guages, all addicted to irregular conjugations. Laurence Sterne
confessed to having been influenced by the novels of Crebillon; Horace
Walpole pre- ferred them to Fielding’s; the virtuous Thomas Gray’s
conception of Par a- dise was “to read eternally new romances by
Marivaux and Crebillon.” 17 Lady Henrietta Stafford rushed over from
England, became Crebillon’s mistress, the mother of his child, then his
wife; we are told that he “made her a model husband.” 18 In 1752 he
joined Alexis Piron and Charles Colle in founding the Caveau (Cave), a
club for gay wits notable for irreverence and pranks. In 1759, by a
reductio ad absurdum, he was appointed royal censor of literature; and
when, after irritating delays, his father died (1762), the son inherited
his pension. All’s well that ends well.</p>
<p>Crebillon’s books lost their popularity long before his death, but
mean - while a learned cleric had written a novel that still lives and
moves today. The life of Antoine Francois Prevost d’Exiles, known as the
Abbe Prevost, was as varied and troubled as the careers that came from
his pen. Born in Artois in 1697, educated by the Jesuits, he became a
novice in the Jesuit order (1713), left it to join the army, worked his
way up to a commission, fell in love, suffered a broken heart, and
became a Benedictine monk (1719) and priest (1726). Thenceforth,
marvelous to relate, he supported himself almost entirely by his
pen.</p>
<p>Even before abandoning monastic life he had begun a romance, Me-
moires et aventures d’un hovrme de qualite, of which the first four
volumes were published at Paris in 1728. After a year in England he
moved to Holland. In 1730 he began to publish a second romance, Le
Philosophe anglais, ou Histoire de Monsieur Cleveland, fils naturel de
Cromwell; this — one of the earliest historical novels — he drew out to
eight volumes in the next nine years. In 1731 he published at Amsterdam
Volumes V-VII of the Memoir es; Volume VII was separately published at
Paris (1731) as Les Aventures du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon
Lescaut, par Monsieur D. It was forbidden by the French government, and
entered at once upon its still continuing popularity. “Paris,” we are
told, “went wild over it;… people rushed for the book as if to a fire.”
19</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>The story of Manon is enclosed in a clumsy mechanism of make-believe.
Twelve prostitutes are in a vehicle en route to Le Havre for deportation
to</p>
<p>America. The Marquis , the nameless “man of quality” who is
supposed</p>
<p>o author all seven volumes of the Memoir es, is struck by the beauty
of one of the girls, whose face is later described as one “that could
bring back the world to idolatry.” 20 He s ees also the desolate
Chevalier des Grieux, who gazes in tears at his former mistress, Manon,
and mourns that he is too bank- rupt to follow her into exile. The
Marquis, doubly touched, gives Des Grieux four louis d’or, which enabled
the Chevalier to ac company Manon to Louisiana. Two years later the
Marquis sees him at Calais, and takes him home. The remainder of the
little volume is Des Grieux’s account of his romance.</p>
<p>He was an exemplary, wellborn youth, who excelled in everything at
college in Amiens. His parents intended him for the order of the Knights
of Malta, and in their fond hopes “they already had me wearing the</p>
<p>Cross.” 21 But Manon passed by, and all was changed. She was then
fifteen; he was seventeen, and “had never give n a thought to the
difference of the sexes.” This arrested development was at once
accelerated. Manon tells him that she has been sent to Amiens, against
her will, to become a nun. He offers to rescue her; they elope to Paris.
Their mutual admiration seemed a sufficient covenant; “we dispensed with
the rites of the Church, and found ourselves man and wife without having
given it a thought.” His brother discovers him, has him arrested, and
takes him back to the father, who in- forms him that Manon has already
become the mistress of the banker Mon- sieur B. Des Grieux proposes to
go and kill B.; the father locks up his son. A friend, Tiburge, comes,
confirms the claim that Manon is B.’s mistress, and urges Des Grieux to
take holy orders. The youth enters the Seminary of St.- Sulpice, and
becomes an abbe. “I thought myself absolutely purged from the wickedness
of love.” Two years later he comes up for public examination and
disputation at the Sorbonne. Manon is in the audience; she makes her way
to him, confesses her infidelity, but swears that she has sinned with B.
only to raise money for Des Grieux. They elope again.</p>
<p>They take a house in suburban Chaillot. They live expensively on the
sixty thousand francs received by Manon from Monsieur B.; Des Grieux,
dis-abbeed and re-chevaliered, hopes to win forgiveness and francs from
his father, or to inherit property on his father’s death. They are
robbed, and find themselves suddenly penniless. “I realized then that
one can love money without being a miser…. I knew Manon;… however
faithful and</p>
<p>fond she might be in good fortune, one could not count on her in
want. She cared too much for pleasure and plenty to sacrifice them for
me.” 22 And he loves her more than honor. He lets her brothers teach him
how to cheat at cards. He wins a small fortune, but is robbed again.
Manon leaves him for</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xa wealthy old voluptuary, explaining in a note, “I am working to
make my Chevalier rich and happy.” He joins with her in a plot to get
money out of the old man; they succeed, abscond, are arrested. She is
committed to the common hospital as a prostitute, he is Sent to a
monastery. From this he es- capes by shooting dead the porter who guards
the gate. He borrows money and bribes the hospital attendants to let
Manon escape. She vows eternal love.</p>
<p>When their funds are exhausted she allows a moneyed heir to set her
up as mistress. She is again arrested, and Des Grieux’s father persuades
the au - thorities to deport her. Des Grieux attempts to rescue her en
route; failing, he embarks with her to New Orleans. There she learns to
bear poverty, and to give Des Grieux complete fidelity. They return to
the practices of re- ligion. But the colonial governor’s son falls in
love with her. As she and Des Grieux have still neglected to secure a
legal marriage, the governor ex- ercises his right to assign her to any
colonist; he bids her accept his son. Des Grieux kills the son in a
duel. He and Manon escape from New Orleans into the wilderness, on foot.
After weary miles she faints, and dies. “For two days and two nights I
stayed with my lips pressed to the face and hands of my dear Manon.” He
digs he r grave there with his hands, buries her, and lies down on the
grave to die. But his good friend Tiburge, who meanwhile has come from
France, finds him, and takes him back to Calais, to the Mar- quis, to
tell his tale.</p>
<p>Manon Lescaut became the fountainhead of a Mississippi of romans lar-
moyants, romances wet with tears. Every woman, even if she is not “at
heart a rake,” weeps over Manon’s grave and Des Grieux’s grief,
forgiving her financial stratagems and his caitiff crimes. Prevost
struck a new note by endowing his hero and heroine with so many faults;
he made them real by baring Manon’s supreme love of pleasure, and her
lover’s capacity for para - sitism, cheating, theft, and homicide; she
is an old type of heroine, he is assuredly a new type of hero. The book
might have reached a starker power had he been left to die on Manon’s
grave.</p>
<p>Perhaps Prevost told the story with such feeling because he had
himself all the ardor of Des Grieux. It was an autobiography before the
event. But he was no parasitic idler. He translated the three enormous
novels of Rich- ardson into French, and these translations inaugurated
in France that craze for Richardson which found such diverse expression
in Rousseau and Dide- rot. He translated Middleton’s Life of Cicero, and
Hume’s History of Eng - land. He wrote several minor novels, and many
volumes of the Histoire generate des voyages. In 1733, at Amsterdam, he
fell in love with another man’s mistress. Learning that the Benedictines
had secured an order for his imprisonment, he fled to England, taking
the lady with him. In London he earned his bread by tutoring. On
December 1 5 he was arrested on a charge</p>

<p>by one of his pupils that he had forged a note for fifty pounds — a
crime for which the statutory penalty was death. He was soon released,
for reasons unknown. He returned to France (1734) and rejoined the
Benedictine order. In 1753 he was appointed to the Priory of
St.-Georges-de-Gennes.</p>
<p>His death, ten years later, led to a legend told as fact by his
grandniece to Sainte-Beuve: that Prevost was stricken with apoplexy
while walking in the woods of Chantilly; that a doctor, thinking him
dead, cut him open to find the cause of his death; that Prevost was
still alive, but that the post-mortem killed him. 23 The story is now
generally rejected. 24</p>
<p>Pr evost’s influence was immense. It shared in shaping Rousseau’s La
Nou - velle Helo’ise; it moved the tough-minded, tenderhearted Diderot
to write sentimental drames larmoyants; it took a completely idealistic
turn in Ber- nardin de Saint- Pierre’s Paul et Virginie; it reappeared
in the Dame aux camelias (1848) of Dumas fils; it played a part in the
Romantic movement till Flaubert introduced Madame Bovary (1857); and
Manon still lives and dies in opera.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MINOR SAGES</li>
</ol>
<p>Another abbe returns to our story, and this time we must give him his
due. We have seen Charles Irenee Castel, Abbe de Saint-Pierre, shocking
the diplomats at Utrecht (1712) with Memoir e pour rendre la paix per-
petuelle, which was to fascinate both Rousseau and Kant. And we have
seen him proposing to the Club de l’Entresol a medley of ideas and
reforms so ad - vanced that Cardinal Fleury felt inspired to close the
club and save the state (1731). What were these ideas?</p>
<p>Like so many rebels, his mind was sharpened by a Jesuit education. It
did not take him long to shed the popular faith; and though he continued
to profess Catholicism, he did it some sly damage by his Discourse
against Mohammedanism, in which his argumen ts, like Voltaire’s in
Mahomet, could readily be applied to orthodox Christianity. His Physical
Explanation of “the pretended miracles told by Protestants, schismatics,
and Mohamme - dans” was obviously intended to question Catholic miracles
as well.</p>
<p>In 1717, and again in 1729, he republished in expanded form his
Projet de paix perpetuelle. He pleaded with the sovereigns of Europe,
including the Sultan, to enter into a sacred pact that would mutually
guarantee their pres- ent possessions, would renounce war as a means of
settling international dis- putes, and would submit these to a European
Union armed with force to compel the acceptance of its decisions. He
drew up a model charter for the Union, with rules of procedure for its
assembly, and specified the financial contributions to be made to the
Union by each member state. He could not</p>
<p>33 &lt;*</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xbe expected to foresee that the Congress of Vienna (1815) would form
on these lines a Holy Alliance to perpetuate monarchical and feudal
institu- tions, and suppress all revolutionary movements.</p>
<p>No difficulties could shake the confidence of the resilient abbe.
He</p>
<p>adopted with religious ardor the rising faith in progress; and in
Observations on the Continuous Progress of Universal Reason (1737) he
proclaimed, long before Condorcet, the indefinite perfectibility of
mankind through the agency of reason in scientists and governments.
After all, he mused, the human race, on accepted authority, is not more
than seven or eight thou- sand years old; therefore it is only “in the
infancy of reason”; what may we not expect of its virile youth six
thousand years hence, and of its glorious flowering in the maturity of
mankind a hundred thousand years from now? 25</p>
<p>Saint-Pierre foresaw our modern problem: that while science and
knowl- edge have made immense advances, there has been no commensurate
prog- ress in morals or politics; knowledge implements vice as much as
it en- lightens morality. How could the growth of knowledge be turned to
the improvement of conduct in individuals and nations? In A Project to
Perfect the Governments of States (1737) Saint-Pierre proposed the
formation of a Political Academy, to be composed of the wisest men in
the land, and to act as an advisory body to the ministers of state in
matters of social or moral reform. He made many specific proposals:
universal education under gov- ernmental (not ecclesiastical) control,
religious toleration, marriage of the clergy, the unification of French
laws, the promotion of public welfare by the state, and the enlargement
of national revenues by progressive taxes on incomes and inheritances.
26 The abbe in 1725 added to the French language the word bienfaisance,
beneficence, to distinguish the humanitarianism that he preferred to the
condescending charities of the Old Regime. And long before Helvetius and
Bentham he laid down the utilitarian principle that “the value of a
book, of a regul ation, of an institution, or of any public work is
proportioned to the number and grandeur of the actual pleasures it pro-
duces, and of the future pleasures which it is calculated to procure for
the greatest number of men.” 27 Most of the basic ideas o f the
philosophes ap- peared as a prelude in Saint-Pierre, even to the hope
for an enlightened king as an agent of reform. With all his simplicity,
naivete, and prolixity he was one of the seminal minds of the
Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Charles Pinot Duclos must have scorned him as a visionary quite
uncon- genial to a realistic mind. Born at Dinan in Brittany, he kept to
the end the sturdy, cautious, obstinate character of the Breton. Son of
a well-to-do bourgeois, and of a mother who died at 101, he had in him
the iron to sur- vive his wild youth in the Paris of the Regency. He
received his higher edu-</p>

<p>cation from the Jesuits and the filles de joie, sowing wild oats
lavishly and sharpening his wit in the cafes. Soon his reputation for
repartee gave him access to society and the salons. He added to his fame
with a novel, Histoire de la baronne de Luz (1741), which was almost an
indictment of God. The Baroness repels all other assaults upon her
marital fidelity, but yields herself to a corrupt magistrate to save the
life of her husband, implicated in a con- spiracy against the King. She
is twice raped. In hysterical anger she cries out, “Cruel Heaven! In
what way have I deserve d your hatred? Can it be that virtue is hateful
to you?” 28</p>
<p>Despite the tenor and eroticism of this book Duclos was elected to
the Academy in 1746 through the influence of Mme. de Pompadour. He en-
tered vigorously into its operations, reorganized it, and brought it
into vitalizing touch with the literature and philosophy of the time. In
1751 he succeeded Voltaire as historiographer to the King; in 1754 he
maneuvered the election of d’Alembert to the Academy; in 1755 he was
elected its per - manent secretary, and remained its dominating spirit
till his death. He won the Academy to liberal ideas, but he deplored the
precipitancy of d’Hol - bach, Helvetius, and Diderot. “This band of
little atheists,” he said, “will end by driving me back to the conf
essional.”</p>
<p>We remember him chiefly for his Considerations sur les moeurs de ce
siecle (1750),* a work of calm and often penetrating analysis of French
morals and character. Written before he was forty-five, it begins with
the solemnity of a senile sag e: “I have lived; I wish to be useful to
those who shall live.” He regrets that “the most civilized peoples are
not also the most virtuous.”</p>
<p>The happiest epoch would be that in which virtue would not be con-
sidered a merit. When it begins to be remarked, manners are already
altered; and if it becomes an object of ridicule, that is the last stage
of corruption. 29</p>
<p>“The great defect of the Frenchman,” in his judgment, “is to have
always a youthful character; thereby he is often amiable, rarely stable;
he has al- most no age of maturity, but passes from youth to
decrepitude…. The Frenchman is the child of Europe” 30 — just as Paris
is its playground. Duclos does not entirely sympathize with the Age of
Reason, which he feels swirl- ing around him: “I am not sure that I have
too high an opinion of my cen - tury, but it seems to me that a certain
fermentation of reason tends to de- velop everywhere.” 31</p>
<ul>
<li>This was followed in 1751 by Memoires pour s ervir de suite aux
Considerations. Duclos’ Memoir es secrets sur les regnes de Louis XIV et
de Louis XV was not published till 1791. Part of this was translated
into English as Secret Memoirs of the Regency.</li>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XWe declaim a great deal in these days against prejudices; perhaps we
have too much destroyed them. Prejudice is a kind of common law</p>
<p>among men…. In this matter I cannot avoid blaming those writers</p>
<p>who,… wishing to attack a superstition (a motive that could be</p>
<p>praiseworthy and useful if the discussion were kept on a
philosophical plane), sap the foundations of morality and weaken the
bonds of so- ciety…. The sad effect which they produce on their readers
is to</p>
<p>make, of the young, bad citizens and scandalous criminals, and to en-
gender unhappiness in old age. 32</p>
<p>Grimm, the Parisian correspondent of foreign dignitaries, was one of
many who resented these delicate aspersions on philosophy by one who had
sampled many bosoms — “When one has a cold heart and a spoiled taste, he
should not write on morals and the arts”; 33 but Grimm had been Duclos’
rival for the favors of Mme. d’fipinay. The Memoires of that tender lady
picture Duclos as rough and tyrannical in possession, and coarsely
bitter in defeat; but Grimm edited those Memoires. If we may believe
these hot and tearful pages, Madame drove Duclos from her home as a
treacherous satyr. The learned Academician wandered to other beds and
other lands, and so, at sixty-seven, to death.</p>
<p>Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, was more lovable. At the
age of eighteen he joined the army, drunk with Plutarch and with
ambition to earn glory in the service of the King. He took part in the
disastrous adven- ture of Marechal de Belle-Isle in the Bohemian
campaign of 1741-43; in the bitter retreat from Prague his legs were
frozen; he fought at Dettingen (1743), but his health was so impaired
that he was soon afterward retired from the army. He sought employment

eyesight began to fail, and a chronic consumptive cough disabled him
from active life.</p>
<p>Books became his consolation. After all, he said, “the best things
are the most common; you can purchase the mind of Voltaire for a crown.”
34 He warned against judging books by their weight; “even the best
authors talk too much,” and many are ponderously obscure; “clearness is
th e ornament of deep thought.” 35 The volume that he himself sent to
the press in 1 746 was a seventy-five- page Introduction d la
connoissance de 1 ’ esprit humain, fol - lowed by 607 reflexions et
maximes in 1 1 5 pages. A year later, in a dingy Paris hotel, he died,
aged thirty-two, the Mozart and Keats of French philosophy.</p>

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>years before Rousseau’s idealization of nature and equality, he
pictured “nature” as a brutal struggle for power, and equality as a
delusion.</p>
<p>Among kings, among peoples, among individuals, the stronger gives
himself rights over the weaker, and the same rule is followed by ani-
mals and inanimate beings, so that everything in the universe is exe-
cuted by violence; and this order, which we blame with some sem-</p>
<p>blance of justice, is the most general law, the most immutable, and
the most important in nature. 37</p>
<p>All men are born unfree and unequal.</p>
<p>It is not true that equality is a law of nature. Nature has made
nothing equal; her sovereign law is subordination and dependence….
He</p>
<p>who is born to obey will obey even on the throne. 38</p>
<p>As for free will, that too is a myth. “The will is never the first
cause of an action, it is the last spring.” If you give the classic
instance of free will, that - ever, is indispensable; only through that
faith, Vauvenargues felt, could life and history have any meaning other
than everlasting strife and final defeat. 40</p>
<p>The most individual feature of Vauvenargues’ philosophy is his
defense of the passions. They must not be destroyed, for they are the
root of per- sonality, genius, and all vigor of thought.</p>
<p>The mind is the eye of the soul, but not its force. Its force is in
the</p>
<p>heart; that is to say, in the passions. The most enlightened reason
does not give us the power to act and to will…. 41 Great thoughts come
from the heart…. Perhaps we owe to the passions the greatest ac-
complishments of the intellect… , 42 Reason and feeling advise and
supplement each other turn by turn. Whoever consults only one of</p>
<p>hem, and renounces the other, foolishly deprives himself of a part of
the resources given us for our conduct. 43</p>
<p>Vauvenargues admitted the pervasiveness of self-love, but refused to
con- sider it a vice, since it is the first necessity of nature’s first
law, self -preserva- tion. Neither is ambition a vice, it is a necessary
spur; “the love of glory makes great careers of nations.” 44 He adds
that “one is not born to glory if he does not recognize the value of
time.” 45 There are real vices, however, which must be controlled by
laws and moral codes; and “the science of government lies in guiding
them [vices] to the public good.” 46 There are</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xreal virtues too, and “the first days of spring have less grace and
charm than the growth of virtue in a youth.” 47</p>
<p>Despite his concessions to Hobbes and La Rochefoucauld, and despite
his own experience of evil in life, Vauvenargues kept his faith in
mankind. Said his friend Marmontel:</p>
<p>He knew the world and did not despise it. Friend of men, he ranked
vice among the misfortunes [rather than among the crimes] of men, and
pity held in his heart the place of indignation and hatred….</p>
<p>He never hu mi liated anyone…. An unalterable serenity concealed his
pains from the eyes of his friends. To sustain adversity one needed only
his example; seeing the equanimity of his spirit, we did not dare be
unhappy before him. 48</p>
<p>Voltaire described him as “the most unfortunate of men, and the most
tranquil.” 49</p>
<p>One of the most gracious aspects of French literature in the
eighteenth century is the warm sympathy and friendly aid that Voltaire,
apostle of reason, extended to Vauvenargues, defender of Pascal and the
“heart.” The youthful philosopher confessed his admiration for “ a man
who honors our century, and who is not less great, nor less celebrated,
than his predeces- sors.” 50 And the older man wrote to him in a moment
of modesty: “If you had been born a few years earlier, my writings would
have had more worth.” 51 The most eloquent passage in all the hundred
volumes of Voltaire is his funeral eulogy of Vauvenargues. 52</p>

<p>Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brede et de Montesquieu, was
born at La Brede, near Bordeaux in the country of Montaigne, on January
18, 1689. He boasted good-humoredly of descent from those Goths who,
after conquering the Roman Empire, “established everywhere monarchy and
liberty.” 53 In any c ase he belonged to the nobility, both of sword and
of robe: his father was chief justice at Guienne, and his mother brought
as her dowry the castle and domain of La Brede. At the moment of his
birth a beggar presented himself at the castle gate; he was brought in
and fed,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>341</p>
<p>and was made the godfather of the child, allegedly in the hope that
Charles would never forget the poor. 54 The boy’s first three years were
spent at nurse among the village peasants. At eleven he was sent to the
college of the Oratorians at Juilly, twenty miles from Paris. At sixteen
he returned to Bordeaux to study law; at nineteen he received his law
degree.</p>
<p>The death of his father (1713) left him, at twenty-four, considerable
property and moderate wealth; he was to speak frequently of “my domain”
and “my vassals,” 55 and we shall find him firmly upholding feudalism. A
year later he was admitted to the Bordeaux Parlement as a councilor and
magistrate. In 1 7 1 6 his uncle, who had bought the presidency of the
Parle- ment, bequeathed to him his fortune and his office. Later
Montesquieu would defend “the sale of employments” as “good in
monarchical states, because it makes it the profession of persons of
family to undertake tasks which they would not assume from disinterested
motives alone.” 58 While retaining the presidency of the Parlement, he
spent most of his time in study. He made experiments, presented papers
on physics and physiology to the Academy of Bordeaux, and planned a
“geological history of the earth.” He never wrote it, but the material
he gathered for it forced its way into The Spirit of Laws.</p>
<p>He was thirty-two when he caught the mood and ear of Regency Paris
with the most brilliant of his books. He did not give his name to the
Lettres persanes (1721), for it contained passages hardly becoming a
magistrate. Probably he took its scheme from VEspion du Grand Seigneur
(1684) of Giovanni Marana, in which an imaginary Turkish spy reported to
the sultan, with some fetching ribaldry, the absurd beliefs and behavior
of the Christians of Europe, and the delightful or murderous contrasts
between Christian professions and practices. A similar device of
picturing Occiden- tal civilization as seen through Oriental eyes had
been used in Addison’s Spectator; Charles Dufresny, in Amusements
serieux et comiques, had conceived the comments of a Siamese in Paris;
Nicolas Gueudeville had shown French customs as seen by an American
Indian. Antoine Galland’s translation of the Arabian Nights — Mille et
une Nuits (1704-17) — had sharpened French interest in Mohammedan life;
so had the travelogues of Jean (Sir John) Chardin and Jean Tavernier.
From March to July, 1721, the Turkish ambassador treated Paris to the
exotic charm of his dress and ways. Paris was ready for the Lettres
persanes. Eight editions were sold out within a year.</p>
<p>Montesquieu presented the letters as written by Rica and Usbek, two
Persians traveling in France, and by their correspondents in Isfahan.
The letters did not merely expose the foibles and prejudices of the
French; they revealed also, through the writers themselves, the
absurdities of Oriental conduct and creeds; laughing at these faults,
the reader was compelled to</p>
<p>34 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xaccept with good grace the ridicule of his own. It was done with so
light a touch — who could take offense at these unconscious epigrams,
these rapier thrusts with politely buttoned foils? Moreover, certain of
the letters con- tained alluring confidences from Usbek’s seraglio in
Isfahan. Zachi, his fa - vorite, writes to tell him how painfully she
misses his passion; and Rica de- scribes a Mohammedan l ady’s conception
of Paradise as a place where every good woman has a harem of handsome
and virile men. Here Montesquieu let himself go into details in the
reckless style of the Regency.</p>
<p>Only during that interregnum could the political and religious
heresies of the Lettres have escaped official rebuke. The old King was
dead, the new one was a boy, the Regent was tolerant and gay; now
Montesquieu could make his Persians laugh at a “magician” ruler who made
people be - lieve that paper was money (Law’s System had just crashed ).
57 He could expose the corruption of the court, the idleness of
spendthrift nobles, the maladministration of state finances. He could
praise the ancient republics of Greece and Rome, and the modern
republics of Holland and Switzer- land. “Monarchy,” says Usbek, “is an
abnormal condition which always degenerates into despotism.” 58 (See
below for a different view.)</p>
<p>Ip Letters XI-XIV Usbek illustrates the nature of man and the problem
of government by telling of the Troglodytes, whom he conceives to be
Arabian descendants of the Troglodytai described by Herodotus 59 and
Aristotle 60 as bestial tribes living in Africa.* Usbek’s Troglodytes,
resenting governmental interference, killed thinking magistrates, and
lived in a para- dise of laissez- faire. Every seller took advantage of
the consumer’s need, and raised the price of the product. When a strong
man stole the wife of a weak man there was no law^ormagistrate to appeal
to. Murder, rape, and robbery went unpunished except by private
violence. When the inhabitants of the highlands suffered from drought,
the lowlanders let them starve; when the lowlanders suffered from flood
the highlanders let them starve. Soon the tribe died out. Two families
survived by emigration; they prac- ticed mutual aid, raised their
children in religion and virtue, and “looked upon themselves as one
single family; their flocks were almost always in- termixed.” 61 But as
they increased in number they f ound their customs in- adequate to
govern them; they chose a king, and submitted to laws. Usbek’s
conclusion: government is necessary, but fails in its function if it is
not based on virtue in ruler and ruled.</p>
<p>The religious heresies in the Persian Letters were more startling
than the political. Rica observes that Negroes conceive God as black and
the Devil as white; he suggests (like Xenophanes) that if triangles
confabulated a theology, God would have three sides and sharp points.

<p>he power of another magician, called pope, who persuades people to
be- lieve that bread is not bread, and wine is not wine, “and a thousand
things of a like nature.” 62 He laughs at the conflict between Jesuits
and Jansenists. He is horrified by the Spanish and Portuguese
Inquisition, where “der - vishes [Dominican monks] cause men to be
burned as they would burn straw.” 63 He smiles at rosaries and
scapulars. He wonders how long the Catholic countries can survive in
competition with Protestant peoples, for he thinks that the prohibition
of divorce, and the celibacy of nuns and monks, will retard the growth
of population in France, Italy and Spain ( cf. twentieth-century
Ireland); at this rate, Usbek calculates, Catholicism in Europe cannot
last five hundred years more. 64 * Moreover, these idle and supposedly
contine nt monks “hold in their hands almost all the wealth of the
state. They are a miserly crew, always getting and never giving; they
are continually hoarding their income to acquire capital. All this
wealth falls as it were into a palsy; it is not circulated; it is not
employed in trade, industry, or manufactures.” 66 Usbek is troubled by
the thought that Eu - rope’s benighted infidels, who worship Christ
instead of Allah and Mo - hammed, seem all destined to hell, but he has
some hope that ultimately they will accept Islam and be saved. 67</p>
<p>Usbek, in a transparent parable, considers the Revocation (1685) of
Henry IV’s tolerant Edict of Nantes:</p>
<p>You know, Mirza, that some ministers of Shah Suleiman [Louis</p>
<p>XIV] formed the design of obliging all the Armenians of Persia
[the</p>
<p>Huguenots] to quit the kingdom or become Mohammedans [Catho- lics] ,
in the belief that our empire will continue polluted as long as it
retains within its bosom these infidels…. The persecution of the</p>
<p>Ghebers by our zealous Mohammedans has obliged them to fly in</p>
<p>crowds into the Indies, and has deprived Persia of that people which
labored so heartily…. Only one thing remained for bigotry to do,</p>
<p>and that was to destroy industry, with the result that the Empire</p>
<p>[France in 1713] fell of itself, carrying along with it that very
religion which they wished to advance.</p>
<p>If unbiased discussion were possible, I am not sure, Mirza, that
it</p>
<p>would not be a good thing for a state to have several religions….</p>
<p>History is full of religious wars; but… it is not the multiplicity
of</p>
<p>religions which has produced wars; it is the intolerant spirit
animating that one which believed itself in the ascendant. 68</p>
<p>The ideas of the Persian Letters seem trite to us now, but when they
were expressed they were for the author a matter of life and death, at
least</p>

<li>Montesquieu thought, in 1721, that the population of Europe was
hardly a tenth of what it had been under the Roman Empire, 6 ° that it
would continue to decrease, and that Negroes would soon die out in

<p>Xof imprisonment or banishment; they are trite now because the fight
for freedom to express ideas was won. Because the Lettres persanes
opened a way, Voltaire was able, thirteen years later, to issue his
Lettres sur les Anglais, putting an English torch to French debris;
these two books an- nounced the Enlightenment. Montesquieu and his
liberty survived his book because he was a noble and the Regent was
tolerant. Even so he did not dare acknowledge his authorship, for there
were some disapproving voices amid the general acclaim. D’Argenson, who
himself would later criticize the government, thought “these are
reflections of a kind which a witty man can easily make, but which a
prudent man ought never allow to be printed.” And the cautious Marivaux
added: “A man must be sparing of his wit on such subjects.” Montesquieu
recalled: “When I had in some degree gained the esteem of the public,
that of the official classes was lost, and I met with a thousand
slights.” 69</p>
<p>Nevertheless he came to Paris to sip his fame in society and the
salons. Mme. de Tencin, the Marquise de Lambert and the Marquise du
Deffand all opened their hearths. Having left his wife behind at La
Brede, he had no difficulty falling in love with the ladies of Paris. He
aimed high — at Marie Anne de Bourbon, sister of the Due de Bourbon who
became prime minister in 1723. For her, we are told, he composed a
little prose poem, Le Temple de Gnide (1725), ecstatic with love. He
anointed its wanton- ness by pretending that it was a translation from
the Greek, and so ob- tained royal permission to print it. He pulled
wires — especially those of Mme. de Prie — to secure admission to the
Academy; the King objected that he was not a resident of Paris; he
hurried to Bordeaux, resigned his presidency of its Parlement (1726),
returned to Paris, and joined the Forty Immortals in 1728.</p>
<p>In April he set out on a tour that took three years and covered parts
of Italy, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, the Rhineland, Holland, and
Eng- land. He remained in England eighteen months (November, 1729, to
August, 1731). There he formed a friendship with Chesterfield and other
notables, was elected to the Royal Society of London and initiated into
Freemasonry, was received by George II and Queen Caroline, attended
Parliament, and fell in love with what he thought was the British
constitu- tion. Like Voltaire he went back to France strong in the
admiration for liberty, yet sobered by contact with the problems of
government. He re- tired to La Brede, transformed his park into an
English garden, and, ex- cept for occasional trips to Paris, gave
himself up to the researches and writings that occupied the rest of his
life.</p>

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>345</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Why Rome Fell</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1734 he issued, unsigned but acknowledged, Considerations sur les
causes de la grandeur des Romains et de leur decadence. He had submitted
the manuscript to a Jesuit scholar, and had consented to eliminate
passages that might give umbrage to the Church. The book did not and
could not repeat the success of the Lettres persanes; it contained no
indecencies, it dealt with a remote and complex subject, it was
relatively conservative in politics and theology. Radicals did not
relish the emphasis on moral decay as a cause of national decline, and
they were not ready to appreciate the terse wisdom of such sentences as:
“Those who have ceased to fear power can still respect authority.” 70
Today the little treatise is looked upon as a pioneer attempt at a
philosophy of history, and as a classic of French prose, recalling
Bossuet but adding brilliance to gravity.</p>
<p>The subject invited the historian-philosopher, for it involved the
whole gamut of a great civilization from birth to death, and exposed in
broad scope and illuminating detail one of the basic processes of
history — the dis- solution that seems fated to follow any full
evolution in individuals, reli- gions, and states. Already there was a
suspicion that France, after the col- lapse of le grand siecle, had
entered upon a long period of decay in empire, morals, literature, and
art; the profane trinity of Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau had not yet
appeared to challenge the intellectual supremacy of the seventeenth
century. But the rising courage of the new age showed in the fact that
Montesquieu, in explaining the course of history, considered only
earthly causes, and quietly set aside, except for incidental obeisance,
the Providence which, in Bossuet’s Discours sur Fhistoire universelle
(1681), had guided all events to divinely determined results.
Montesquieu proposed to seek laws in history as Newton had sought them
in space:</p>
<p>It is not Fortune who governs the world, as we see from the
history</p>
<p>of the Romans…. There are general causes, moral or physical,</p>
<p>which operate in every monarchy, raise it, maintain it, or overthrow
it.</p>
<p>All that occurs is subject to these causes; and if a particular
cause, like the accidental result of a battle, has ruined a state, there
was a general cause which made the downfall of this state ensue from a
single battle.</p>
<p>In a word, the principal movement [Failure principale ] draws with it
all the particular occurrences. 71</p>
<p>Consequently Montesquieu reduced the role of the individual in
history. The indi vidual, however great his genius, is but an instrument
of the “gen - eral movement”; his importance is due not to his
surpassing ability so much as to his falling in with what Hegel was to
call the Zeitgeist , or spirit of the</p>
<p>346</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xime. “If Caesar and Pompey had thought like Cato [had striven to
preserve the powers of the Roman Senate], others would have come to the
same ideas [to subordinate the Senate] as those of Caesar and Pompey,
and the Republic, destined to perish [from internal causes] would have
been led to ruin by some other hand.” 72</p>
<p>But this “destiny” was no mystical guidance or metaphysical force; it
was a complex of factors producing the “principal movement”; and the
main func tion of the philosophical historian, in Montesquieu’s view, is
to ferret out each such factor, analyze it, and show its operation and
relations. So the decline of Rome (he thought) was due first of all to a
change from a republic — in which there had been a division and balance
of powers — to an empire better fitted to govern dependencies, but so
centering all rule in one city and one man as to destroy the liberty and
vigor of the citizens and the provinces. To this prime cause were added
other factors in the course of time: the spread of supine servility
among the masses; the desire of the poor to be supported by the state;
the weakening of character by wealth, luxury, and license; the influx of
aliens unformed by Roman traditions and ready to sell their votes to the
highest bidder; the corruption of central and provincial administrators;
the depreciation of currency; the excess of tax- ation; the abandonment
of farms; the sapping of martial virility by new religions and a long
peace; the failure of military discipline; the ascendancy of the army
over the civilian government; the preference of the army for making or
unmaking emperors in Rome rather than for defending the fron- tiers from
barbarian invasion… Perhaps in reaction against the super- natural
emphasis in Bossuet, Montesquieu made little account of those changes in
religion which Gibbon was to stress as a main cause of the im- perial
collapse.</p>
<p>But always Montesquieu came back to what he considered the prime fact
or in Rome’s decadence— the passage from republic to monarchy. By their
republican maxims the Romans conquered a hundred peoples; but by the
time they had accomplished this the republic could not subsist; and the
maxims of the new government, contrary to those of the republic, caused
the decline. 73 However, when we go back to Chapter vi, and examine the
maximes, or methods, by which the Roman Republic conquered “all the
peoples,” we find a strange assortment: deceit, broken treaties, force,
severe punishments, division of the enemy for piecemeal conquest (
divide et iw- pera ) , forcible reshuffling of populations, subverting
resistant governments by subsidizing internal revolts, and other
procedures familiar to states- men. “The Romans used thei r allies to
destroy an enemy, and then</p>
<p>soon destroyed the destroyers.” 74 Apparently forgetting this
description of republican maxims, or swallowing Machiavelli at one gulp,
Montesquieu, in</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>Chapter xvm, held up the Republic as an ideal of greatness, and
deplored the Empire as a gay landslide to dissolution. Yet he recognized
the corrup- tion of politics in the Republic, and the political splendor
of the Empire under “the wisdom of Nerva, t he glory of Trajan, the
valor of Hadrian, and the virtue of the two Antonines”; 75 here
Montesquieu gave a lead to Gibbon and Renan in naming that period the
noblest and happiest in the history of government. In those
philosopher-kings too Montesquieu found the ethics of the Stoics, which
he clearly preferred to the Christian. His admiration for the Romans of
the Republic passed down to the French en- thusiasts of the Revolution,
and shared in changing French government, martial methods, and art.</p>
<p>The book had some faults of a scholarship made hasty by the press of
time and the call of a larger task. Montesquieu was sometimes uncritical
in his use of classical texts; so, for example, he took as history
Livy’s chapters on Rome’s beginnings, whereas Valla, Glareanus, Vico,
and Pouilly had already rejected that account as legend. He
underestimated the economic factors behind the politics of the Gracchi
and Caesar. But against these shortcomings a larger view ranges the
eloquence, vigor, and concentration of the style, the depth and
originality of the thought, the bold attempt to see in one perspective
the rise and fall of a complete civilization, and to ele- vate history
from a record of details to the analysis of institutions and the logic
of events. Here was a challenge to historians, which Voltaire and Gibbon
would seek to meet; and here was that longing for a philosophy of
history which Montesquieu himself, after a generation of labor, would
try to satisfy with The Spirit of Laws.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Spirit of Laws</li>
</ol>
<p>Fourteen years passed between the Considerations and UEsprit des
lois. Montesquieu had begun his chef- d’oeuvre about 1729, aged forty;
the essay on Rome was a by-product and interruption. In 1747, aged
fifty-six, he grew tired of the toil, and was tempted to abandon it:
“Often have I begun this work, and often have I laid it aside. I have a
thousand times cast to the winds the leaves that I had written.” 76 He
appeal ed to the Muses to sustain him: “I am running a long course, I am
weighed down with sadness and weariness. Pour into my soul the
persuasive charm that once I knew, but which now flies from me. You are
never so divine as when you lead us through pleasur e to wisdom and
truth.” 77 They must have responded, for he carried on. When at last the
task was done, he confessed his hesitations and his pride:</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XI have followed my object without forming a plan; I have known</p>
<p>neither rule nor exceptions; I have found the truth only to lose
it</p>
<p>again. But when I once discovered my principles, everything I sought
for came to me; and in the course of twenty years I have seen my work
begun, growing up, advancing toward completion, and finished….</p>
<p>If this work meets with success I shall owe it chiefly to the
grandeur and majesty of the subject. However, I do not think that I have
been totally deficient in genius…. When I have seen what so many great
men in both France and Germany have written fon this subject] be-</p>
<p>fore me, I have been lost in admiration, but I have not lost my
courage;</p>
<p>I have said with Correggio, “And I too am a painter.” 78</p>
<p>He showed the manuscript to Helvetius, Henault, and Fontenelle. Fon-
tenelle thought the treatise lacked le bon genre of French style; 79
Helvetius begged the author not to ruin his reputation as a liberal by
publishing a book so lenient to many conservative beliefs. 80
Montesquieu judged these cautions irrelevant, and proceeded to print.
Fearing the French censorship, he sent the manuscript to Geneva; it was
published there in 1748 in two volumes, unsigned. When the French clergy
had ferreted out its heresies they condemned it, and a government order
forbade its distribution in France. In 1750 Malesherbes — future savior
of the Encyclopedic — became censor, removed the prohibition, and the
book rapidly made its way. Twenty-two editions were printed in two
years, and soon the work was translated into all the languages of
Christian Europe.</p>
<p>Titles in Montesquieu’s time were honestly, often laboriously,
explana - tory. So he called his book On the Spirit of Laws, or On the
Relations Which Must Exist between the Laws and the Constitution of Each
Gov- ernment, the Manners, Climate, Religion, Commerce, etc. It was an
essay on the relations between physical forces and social forms, and on
the inter- relations among the components of civilization. It tried to
lay the founda- tions for what we should now call “scientific”
sociology: to make possible — after the manner of research in the
natural sciences — verifiable conclusions illuminating present society
and conditionally predicting the future. It was, of course, too much for
one man to accomplish in the brevity of life and the existing state of
ethnology, jurisprudence, and historiography.</p>
<p>More specifically, Montesquieu’s thesis was that “the spirit of
laws”— i.e., their origin, character, and tendency — is determined first
by the climate and soil of the habitat, and then by the physiology,
economy, government, re- ligion, morals, and manners of the people. He
began with a broad defini- tion: “Laws, in their most general
signification, are the necessary relations arising from the nature of
things”; obviously he wished to bring the “nat - ural laws” of the
physical world, and the assumed regularities in history,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>under one general concept. Following Grotius, Pufendorf, and other
prede- cessors, he distinguished several kinds of laws: ( i ) natural
law, which he defined as “human reason so far as it governs all the
peoples of the earth” 81 — i.e., the “natural rights” of all men as
beings endowed with reason; (2) the law of nations in their relations
with one another; (3) political law, govern- ing the relations between
the individual and the state; and (4) civil law — the relations of
individuals with one another.</p>
<p>In the early stages of human society, Montesquieu thought, the basic
determinant of laws is the physical character of the terrain. Is it
jungle, desert, or arable? Is it inland or coastal? Is it mountainous or
plain? What is the quality of the soil, and the nature of the food it
yields? In a word, cli- mate is the first, and at first the most
powerful, factor in determining a people’s economy, its laws, and its
“national character.” (Bodin in the six - teenth century anticipated,
and Buckle in the nineteenth followed, Montes- quieu in this initial
emphasis.) For example, consider the climatic, and consequent human,
differences between north and south:</p>
<p>People are more vigorous in cold climates…. This superiority of</p>
<p>strength must produce various effects: for instance, a greater
boldness, i.e., more courage; a greater sense of superiority, i.e., less
desire of re- venge; a greater sense of security, i.e., more frankness,
less suspicion, policy, and cunning…. I have been at the opera in
England and in</p>
<p>Italy, where I have seen the same pieces and the same performers; and
yet the same music produced such different effects on the two nations;
one is so cold and phlegmatic, and the other so lively and
enraptured.</p>
<p>… If we travel toward the north we meet with people who have few
vices, many virtues…. If we draw near the south we fancy our-</p>
<p>selves entirely removed from the verge of morality; here the
strongest passions are productive of all manner of crimes, each man
endeavoring, let the means be what they will, to indulge his inordinate
desires….</p>
<p>In warm countries the aqueous part of the blood loses itself greatly
bv perspiration; it must therefore be supplied by a like liquid. Water
is</p>
<p>here of admirable uses; strong liquors would congeal the globules of
the blood which remains after the transuding of the aqueous humor.</p>
<p>In cold countries the aqueous part of the blood is very little
evacuated by perspiration. They must therefore make use of spirituous
liquors, without which the blood would congeal…. The law of Mohammed,
which prohibits the drinking of wine, is therefore fitted to the climate
of Arabia…. The law which forbade the Carthaginians to drink</p>
<p>wine was a law of the climate. Such a law would be improper for cold
countries, where the climate seems to force them to a kind of national
intemperance…. Drunkenness predominates… in proportion to</p>
<p>he coldness and humidity of the climate. 82</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XOr consider the relations between climate and marriage:</p>
<p>Women, in hot countries, are marriageable at eight, nine, or ten</p>
<p>years of age…. They are old at twenty; their reason, therefore,</p>
<p>never accompanies their beauty. When beauty demands the empire, the
want of reason forbids the claim; when reason is obtained, beauty is no
more. These women ought then to be in a state of dependency, for reason
cannot procure in old age that empire which even youth</p>
<p>and beauty could not give. It is therefore extremely natural that
in</p>
<p>hese places a man, when no law opposes it, should leave one wife to
take another, and that polygamy should be introduced.</p>
<p>In temperate climates, where the charms of women are best pre-</p>
<p>served, where they arrive later at maturity, and have children at a
more advanced stage of life, the old age of their husbands in some
degree follows theirs; and as they have more reason and knowledge at
the</p>
<p>ime of marriage [than their semitropical analogues]… it must</p>
<p>naturally introduce a kind of equality between the sexes, and in con-
sequence of this, the law of having only one wife…. That is the</p>
<p>reason why Mohammedanism [with polygamy] was so easily estab- lished
in Asia, and with such difficulty extended in Europe; why</p>
<p>Christianity is maintained in Europe, and has been destroyed in Asia;
and, in fine, why the Mohammedans have made such progress in China, and
the Christians so little. 83</p>
<p>At this point Montesquieu realizes that he has replaced Bossuet’s
Provi^ dence with climate, and hastens to add, for God’s sake, a saving
caution: “Human reasons, however, are subordinate to that Supreme Cause
who does whatever He pleases, and renders everything subordinate to His
will.” Some Jesuits thought that they saw Montesquieu’s tongue in his
cheek.</p>
<p>He soon resumed his reckless generalizations. In the “East” (Turkey,
Persia, India, China, Japan) the climate compels the seclusion of women,
for “the hot airs inflame the passions,” and would endanger polygamy as
well as monogamy if the sexes were as free to mingle as “in our
northern</p>
<p>Customs are more directly the result of climate than laws are, for
laws must sometimes seek to counter the effects of climate. As
civilization ad- vances, climatic factors are and must be more and more
controlled by moral or legal restraints, as in the Oriental seclusion of
women. And the wisest</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>35 1</p>
<p>legislators aim to balance “physical causes.” Customs are a function
of place and time; none is in itself right or wrong or best. By and
large, custom is the best law, since it is a natural adaptation of
character to situation. We must move slowly in trying to change a
custom. Usually a custom refuses to be changed by a law. 86</p>
<p>Since habitat determines custom, which determines national character,
the form of government will vary with the complex of all three. In gen-
eral it will depend upon the extent of the area ruled: a republic
comports with a small territory, whose leading citizens can assemble in
one place for deliberation or action; if the area expands it will
require more laws and wars, and will submit to monarchical rule.
Monarchy passes into despotism when it governs too much terrain; for
only despotic power can keep under subjection the local rulers of
distant provinces. 87 A monarchy must rest on “honor”; i.e., its
population must be ranged in ranks, and its citizens must be zealous for
distinction and preference. A republic must rest on a wide dissemination
of “virtue,” which Montesquieu defines in his own way as “the love of
one’s country— i.e., the love of equality.” 88</p>
<p>A republic may be either an aristocracy or a democracy, according as
it is ruled by only a part of the citizenry or by all. Montesquieu
admires Venice as an aristocratic republic, and the ancient city-states
as democra- cies; he knows but ignores the fact that in these the
enfranchised citizens were only a minority. He praises the rule
established by William Penn in America, and, still more
enthusiastically, the theocratic communism organ- ized by the Jesuits in
Paraguay. 89 To be real, however, an honest democ- racy must provide
economic as well as political equality; it should regulate inheritances
and dowries, and progressively tax wealth. 90 The best republics are
those in which the people, recognizing their incapacity to wisely deter-
mine policy, accept the policies adopted by the representatives whom
they have chosen.</p>
<p>A democracy should aim at equality, but it can be ruined by a
spirit</p>
<p>of extreme equality, when each citizen would fain be on a level with
those whom he has chosen to command him…. Where this is the</p>
<p>case virtue can no longer subsist in the republic. The people are de-
sirous of exercising the functions of the magistrates, who cease to be
revered. The deliberations of the senate are slighted; all respect is
then laid aside for the senators, and consequently for old age. If there
is no more respect for old age, there will be none presently for
parents;</p>
<p>deference to husbands will be likewise thrown off, and submission to
masters. This license will soon become general…. The people fall</p>
<p>into this misfortune when those in whom they confided, desirous of
concealing their corruption, endeavor to corrupt them…. The</p>
<p>people will divide the public money among themselves, and, having</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xadded the administration of affairs to their indolence, will be for
blend- ing their poverty with the amusement of luxury. 91</p>
<p>And so, says the Baron, echoing Plato across two thousand years,
democ- racy falls into chaos, invites dictatorship, and disappears.</p>
<p>There are many passages in Montesquieu that favor an aristocratic re-
public, but he so feared the despotism that he thought potential in
democ- racy that he was willing to put up with monarchy if it ruled by
established laws. The shortest chapter in his book is on despotism, and
consists of three lines: “When the savages of Louisiana desire fruit,
they cut the tree to the root and gather the fruit. This is a symbol of
despotic government”; 92 i.e., the despot cuts down the ablest families
to safeguard his power. The exam- ples Montesquieu gave were safely
Oriental, but he was apparently fearful that the Bourbon monarchy was
tending toward despotism, now that Car- dinal Richelieu and Louis XIV
had destroyed the political power of the aristocracy. He spoke of the
Cardinal as “bewitched with the love of des- potic power.” 93 As a
French noble he strongly resented the reduction of his class to mere
courtiers of the king. He believed that “intermediate, subor - dinate,
and dependent powers” were necessary to a healthy monarchy; and by these
powers he meant the landed nobility and the hereditary magis- tracy, to
both of which he belonged. So he defended feudalism at great length (173
pages), sacrificing the unity and symmetry of his book. Alone among the
philosophers of eighteenth-century France he spoke with respect of the
Middle Ages, and made Gothic a term of praise. In the conflict that
continued throughout the reign of Louis XV between the monarch and the
parlements the embattled magistrates found an arsenal of argument in L’
Esprit des lois.</p>
<p>Montesquieu’s resentment of absolute monarchy as the vestibule to des
- potism led him to favor a “mixed government” of monarchy,
aristocracy,</p>
<p>In such a state there are always persons distinguished by their
birth, riches, or honors. Were they to be confounded with the common
peo- ple, and to have only the weight of a single vote like the rest,
the</p>
<p>common liberty would be their slavery, and they would have no
inter-</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>est in supporting it, as most of the popular resolutions would be
against them. The share they have, therefore, ought to be proportioned
to</p>
<p>heir other advantages in the state; which happens only where they
form a body that has a right to check the licentiousness of the people,
as the people have a right to oppose any encroachment upon their</p>
<p>liberty. The legislative power is therefore committed to the body
of</p>
<p>he nobles, and to that which represents the people, each having its
assemblies and deliberations apart, each its separate interest and
views. 95</p>
<p>Each of the three powers in the government, and each of the two
chambers in the legislature, should serve as a check and balance against
the others. By this complex way the liberties of the citizen will be
reconciled with the wisdom, justice, and vigor of the government.</p>
<p>These ideas on mixed government had come down from Aristotle, but the
plan for a separation of powers had developed in Montesquieu’s mind from
his study of Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and Locke, and from his
experience in England. He thought he had found there, however imper-
fect, his ideal of a monarchy checked by democracy in the House of Com-
mons, this checked by aristocracy in the House of Lords; and he supposed
that the courts of England were an independent check on Parliament and
the king. He idealized what he had seen in England under the chaperonage
of Chesterfield and other nobles; but like Voltaire he used this
idealization as a spur to France. He must have known that the English
courts were not quite independent of Parliament, but he thought it good
that France should contemplate the right of the accused in England to an
early examination or release on bail, to be tried by a jury of his own
class, to challenge his ac- cusers, and to be exempt from torture. But
also he thought that “the nobil - ity ought not to be cited before the
ordinary court of judicature, but be- fore that part of the legislature
which is composed of their own body”; they too should have the right of
“being judged by their peers.” 98</p>
<p>Montesquieu, like nearly all of us, became increasingly conservative
with age. Conservatism is a function and obligation of old age, as
radicalism is a useful function of youth, and moderation a gift and
service of middle age; so we have a mixed constitution of a nation’s
mind, with a division and mutual checking of powers. With all his laud
of liberty as the true end of government, Montesquieu defined liberty as
“a right of doing whatever the laws permit. If a citizen could do what
they forbid he would no longer be possessed of liberty, because all his
fellow citizens would have the same power.” 97 And he agreed with his
fellow Gascon, Montaigne, in depre - cating revolutions:</p>
<p>When the form of government has been long established, and affairs
have reached a fixed condition, it is almost always prudent to leave</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhem there; because the reasons — often complicated or unknown —
which have allowed such a state to subsist will still maintain it.
98</p>
<p>He rejected the idea of equality in property or power, but he felt
like the Gracchi about the concentration of land ownership.</p>
<p>With land sufficient to nourish a nation… the common people</p>
<p>have scarcely enough to nourish a family…. The clergy, the</p>
<p>prince, the cities, the great men, and some of the principal citizens
in- sensibly become proprietors of all the land which lies
uncultivated.</p>
<p>The families who are ruined have left their fields, and the laboring
man is destitute. In this situation they [the ruling classes]… should
dis-</p>
<p>ribute land to all the families that are in want, and procure them
ma- terials for clearing and cultivating it. This distribution ought to
be</p>
<p>continued as long as there is a man to receive it. 99</p>
<p>He condemned the farming of tax collecting to private financiers. He
de- nounced slavery with moral fervor and bitter irony. 100 He
acknowledged the occasional necessity of war, and stretched the concept
of defense to sanction pre-emptive war:</p>
<p>With a state the right of natural defense carries along with it
some-</p>
<p>imes the necessity of attacking; as, for instance, when one sees that
a continuance of peace will enable another to destroy her, and that to
attack that nation instantly is the only way to prevent her own des-</p>
<p>ruction. 101</p>
<p>But he deprecated the competitive amassing of armament:</p>
<p>A new distemper has spread itself over Europe, infecting our princes,
and inducing them to keep up an exorbitant number of troops. It has its
redoublings, and of necessity becomes contagious. For as soon as one
prince augments his forces, the rest, of course, do the same; so that
nothing is gained thereby, but the public ruin. 102</p>
<p>Though he esteemed patriotism so highly as to identify it with
virtue, he had moments in which he dreamed of a larger ethic:</p>
<p>If I knew of something that was useful to myself but injurious to my
family, I would cast it from my mind. If I knew of something which</p>
<p>was useful to my family but not to my country, I would try to
forget</p>
<p>it. If I knew of something that was useful to my country but
injurious to Europe and the human race, I should regard it as a crime.
103</p>
<p>His ultimate ethic and secret religion were those of the ancient
Stoics:</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>Never were any principles more worthy of human nature, and more
proper to form the good man…. If I could for a moment cease to</p>
<p>hink that I am a Christian, I should… rank the destruction of the</p>
<p>sect of Zeno among the misfortunes that have befallen the human</p>
<p>race…. It was this sect alone that made citizens, this alone that
made great men, this alone great emperors. Laying aside for a moment re-
vealed truths, let us search through all nature, and we shall not find a
nobler object than the Antonines, not even Julian himself (a commen-
dation thus wrested from me will not render me an accomplice of his
apostasy). No, there has not been a prince, since his reign, more</p>
<p>worthy to govern mankind. 104</p>
<p>Visibly Montesquieu took care, in UEsprit des lois , to make his
peace with Christianity. He acknowledged God — “for what greater
absurdity could there be than a blind fatality which had brought forth
intelligent beings ?” 105 But he conceived this Supreme Intelligence a s
expressed in the laws of nature, and never interfering with them. “For
Montesquieu,” said Faguet, “God is the Spirit of Laws.” 106 He accepted
supernatural beliefs as a necessary support of a moral code uncongenial
to the nature of man. “It is proper there should be some sacred books to
serve for a rule, as the Koran among the Arabs, the books of Zoroaster
among the Persians, the Veda among the Indians, and the classics among
the Chinese. The religious code supplements the civil, and fixes [limits
] the extent of arbitrary sway.” 107 State and Church should act as
checks and balances to each other, but should always remain separate;
“this great distinction [is] the basis of the tranquillity of nations.”
108 Montesquieu defended religion against Bayle , 109 but he subjected
it, like everything else, to the influence of climate and na- tional
character:</p>
<p>A moderate government is most agreeable to the Christian religion,
and a despotic government to the Mohammedan…. When a reli-</p>
<p>gion adapted to the climate of one country clashes too much with the
climate of another, it cannot be there established, and, if introduced,
it will be discarded. 110… The Catholic religion is most agreeable to
monarchy, and the Protestant to a republic…. When the Christian</p>
<p>religion… became unhappily divided into Catholic and Protestant,</p>
<p>he people of the north embraced the Protestant, and those of the
south still adhered to the Catholic. The reason is plain: the people of
the</p>
<p>north have, and will forever have, a spirit of liberty and
independence, which the people of the south have not; and therefore a
religion which has no visible head is more agreeable. 111</p>
<p>While conceding the benefits of religion in gross, he berated it in
detail. He condemned the wealth of the clergy in France , 112 and wrote
“a most</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhumble remonstrance to the Inquisitors of Spain and Portugal” to
stop roasting heretics; he wa rned them that “if anyone in times to come
shall dare to assert that, in the age in which we live, the people of
Europe were civilized, you will be cited to prove that they were
barbarians.” 113 As a patriotic Gallican he laughed at papal
infallibility, and insisted that the Church should be subject to the
civil power. As to religious toleration he took a middle view: “When the
state is at liberty to receive or reject a new religion, it ought to be
rejected; when it is received it ought to be toler- ated.” 114 With all
his obeisance to the censor he remained a rationalist. “Reason is the
most perfect, the most noble, the most beautiful of all our faculties
[la raison est le plus parfait, le plus noble, et le plus exquis de tous
les sens].” lls Wha t better motto could the Age of Reason display?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Aftermath</li>
</ol>
<p>The Spirit of Laws was soon recognized as a major event in French
liter- ature, but it met with criticism from both right and left. The
Jansenists and the Jesuits, normally at odds, united in condemning the
book as a subtle repudiation of Christianity. Said the Jansenist
Ecclesiastical News: “The parentheses that the author inserts to inform
us that he is a Christian give slight assurance of his Catholicism; the
author would laugh at our simplicity if we should take him for what he
is not”; and the reviewer ended with an appeal to the secular
authorities to take action against the book. 116 The Jesuits accused
Montesquieu of following the philosophy of Spinoza and Hobbes; in
assuming laws in history as in natural science, he left no room for
freedom of the will. Father Berthier, in the Jesuit Journal de Trevoux,
argued that truth and justice are absolute, not relative to place or
time, and that laws should be based on God-given universal principles,
rather than on diversities of climate, soil, custom, or national
character. 117 Montesquieu thought it wise to issue (1750) a Defense de
1 ’ Esprit des lois, in which he disclaimed atheism, materialism, and
determinism, and reaffirmed his Chris- tianity. The clergy remained
unconvinced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rising philosophes were also displeased. They
considered The Spirit of Laws as almost a manual of conservatism; they
resented its occasional piety, the moderation of its proposed reforms,
and its halfhearted conception of religious toleration. 118 Helvetius
wrote to Montesquieu chid- ing him with laying too much emphasis on the
dangers and difficulties of social change. 119 Voltaire, who was
preparing his own philosophy of history in the Essai sur les moeurs, was
not enthusiastic over Montesquieu’s achievement. He had not forgotten
that Monsieur le President had opposed his admission to the Academy with
the words, “It would be a disgrace to</p>
<p>CHAP, x)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>he Academy if Voltaire were a member, and it will one day be his
disgrace that he was not one.” 120 Under the circumstances Voltaire’s
criticism was restrained, and was dammed with considerable praise. He
argued that Mon- tesquieu had exaggerated the influence of climate; he
noted that Christian- ity had originated in hot Judea and was still
flourishing in chilly Norway; and he thought it more likely that England
had gone Protestant because Anne Boleyn was beautiful than because Henry
VIII was cold. 121 If, as Montesquieu had suggested, the spirit of
liberty rose chiefly in mountain regions, how explain the sturdy Dutch
Republic, or the liberum veto of the Polish lords? In his Philosophical
Dictionary (1764) Voltaire filled pages with examples indicating that
“climate has some influence, govern - ment a hundred times more,
religion and government combined more still.” 122</p>
<p>We might ask those who maintain that climate does everything</p>
<p>[Montesquieu had not claimed this], why the Emperor Julian, in
his</p>
<p>Misopogon , says that what pleased him in the Parisians was the
gravity of their character and the severity of their manners; and why
these</p>
<p>Parisians, without the slightest change of climate, are now like
playful children, whom the government punishes and smiles at at the same
mo- ment, and who themselves, the moment after, also smile and sing lam-
poons upon their masters. 123</p>
<p>Voltaire found it</p>
<p>melancholy that in so many citations and so many maxims the con-</p>
<p>rary of what is asserted should be almost always the truth…. “Peo -
ple of warm climates are timid, like old men; those of cold countries
are courageous, like young ones”? We should take great care how</p>
<p>general propositions escape us. No one has ever been able to make a
Laplander or an Eskimo warlike, while the Arabs in fourscore years</p>
<p>conquered a territory which exceeded that of the whole Roman Em-
pire. 124</p>
<p>And then the praise:</p>
<p>After thus convincing ourselves that errors abound in The Spirit
of</p>
<p>Laws ,… that this work wants method, and possesses neither plan</p>
<p>nor order, it is proper to ask what really forms its merit and has
led to its great reputation. In the first place, it is written with
great wit, whilst the authors of all the other books on this subject are
tedious. It was on this account that a lady [Mme. du Deffand], who
possessed as much wit as Montesquieu, observed that his book was V
esprit sur les lois [wit about laws]; it can never be more correctly
defined. A still. stronger</p>
<p>35 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xreason is that the book exhibits grand views, attacks tyranny,
supersti- tion, and grinding taxation…. Montesquieu was almost always
in</p>
<p>error with the learned, because he was not learned; but he was almost
always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery. Europe
owes him eternal gratitude. 125</p>
<p>And he added, elsewhere: “Humanity had lost its title deeds [to
freedom j, and Montesquieu recovered them.” 126</p>
<p>Later criticism has largely agreed with Voltaire, while checking his
own exaggerations. 127 It is true that The Spirit of Laws was poorly
constructed, with little logic in the arrangement and sequence of the
topics, and frequent forgetting of the unifying theme. In his zeal to be
a scientist, to accumulate and interpret facts, Montesquieu ceased at
times to be an artist; he lost the whole in the parts instead of
co-ordinating the parts into a harmonious whole. He had gathered his
data over half a lifetime; he wrote his book during twenty years; its
sporadic composition injured its unity. He general- ized too readily
from a few instances, and did not look about him for con- trary
instances — e.g., Catholic Ireland in the cold and “therefore”
Protestant</p>
<p>Against these faults there must have been great virtues to give the
book its acclaim and influence. Voltaire rightly signalized the style.
This too, however, suffered from fragmentation. Montesquieu indulged a
liking for short chapters, perhaps as a means of emphasis, as in the
“chapter” on des - potism; the result is unpleasantly staccato,
obstructing the flow of thought. Part of this fragmentation may have
been due to progressive weakening of his eyes, compelling him to dictate
instead of writing. When he let himself go and spoke out, he achieved,
with crisp and pithy sentences, some of the brilliance that had
brightened the Lettres per sane s. Voltaire thought there were more
epigrams in V Esprit des lois than befitted a work on law. (“In Venice,”
said Montesquieu, “they are so habituated to parsimony that none but
courtesans can make them part with their money.” 128 ) It is
nevertheless a magistral style, moderate and calm. It is occasionally
obscure, but it re- pays unraveling.</p>
<p>Montesquieu was modest and right in ascribing part of the value of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>book to its subject and aim. To find laws in laws, some system in
their variation in place and time, to enlighten rulers and reformers by
consider- ing the sources and limits of legislation in view of the
nature and place of states and men — this was a majestic enterprise,
whose scope made faults forgivable. Herbert Spencer failed in the same
enterprise 129 1 48 years later, despite a corps of research aides, and
because of a similar passion for gen- eralization; but both attempts
were increments of wisdom. Montesquieu’s achievement was the greater. He
had predecessors;* he did not inaugurate, but he powerfully advanced the
historical method for the comparative study of institutions. He
anticipated Voltaire in establishing a philosophy of history independent
of supernatural causes; and he achieved a breadth and impartial).y of
view never reached by Voltaire. Burke called Montes- quieu “the g:
latest genius which has enlightened this age”; 130 Taine con - sidered
him “the best instructed, the most sagacious, and the be st balanced of
aU the spirits of the time.” 131 Horace Walpole thought The Spirit of
Law: “the best book that ever was written.” 132 Perhaps not, but it was
the greatest book of the generation.</p>
<p>It exhausted its author. He wrote to a friend in 1749: “I confess
that this work has nearly killed me. I shall rest; I shall toil no
more.” 133 He continued to study nevertheless. “Study has been for me,”
he said, “the sovereign remedy against all the disappointments of life.
I have never known any trouble t hat an hour’s reading would not
dissipate.” 134</p>
<p>He visited Paris occasionally, and enjoyed his fame, which at that
time (1748) equaled Voltaire’s. “ The Spirit of Laws,” said Raynal, “has
turned the heads of the whole French people. We find this work in the
libraries of our scholars and on the dressing tables of our ladies and
our fashionable young men.” 135 He was again welcomed in the salons, and
he was received at court. But for the most part he stayed at La Brede,
content to be a grand seigneur. His book so pleased the English that
they sent in large orders for the wine grown on his lands. In his last
years he became almost blind. “It seems to me,” he said, “that the
little light left to me is but the dawning of the day when my eyes will
close forever.” 136 In 1754 he went to Paris to end the lease on his
house there; but on that visit he developed pneu- monia and died,
February 10, 1755, aged sixty-six. He had received the last rites of the
Catholic Church, but the agnostic Diderot was the only man of letters
who attended his funeral. 137 His influence spread over centuries. “In
the forty years since the publication of The Spirit of Laws,” wrote
Gibbon, “no work has been more read and criticized, and the spirit of
inquiry which it has excited is not the least of our obligations to the
author.” 138 Gibbon,</p>

from The Spirit of Laws and The Greatness and Decadence of the Romans.
Frederick the Great thumbed V Esprit des lois only next to The Prince;
Catherine the Great thought it should be “the breviary of sovereigns ,”
139 and made extracts from it for the men whom she appointed to revise
Rus- sia’s laws. 140 The framers of the American Constitution took from
Mon - tesquieu not only the separation of governmental powers but the
exclusion of cabinet members from Congress; and their writings were
interspersed with quotations from his work. The Spirit of Laws became
almost the bible of the moderate leaders in the French Revolution, and
from The Greatness and Decadence came, in part, their admiration for the
Roman Republic. “All the great modern ideas,” said Faguet, “have their
commencement in Montesquieu.” 141 For a generation it was Montesquieu,
not Voltaire, who was the voice and hero of the mind of France.</p>
