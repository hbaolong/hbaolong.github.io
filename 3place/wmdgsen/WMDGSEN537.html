Poland</h4>
<ul>

<p>I. POLISH PANORAMA: I 7 I 5-64</p>
<p>G EOGRAPHY, race, religion, and politics were the natural enemies of
Poland. The country was as large as France, extending in 1715 from</p>
<p>he Oder in the west almost to Smolensk and Kiev in the east; but it
had no natural boundary — no mountains or broad river — on either front
to protect it from invasion; it was named from pole, a plain. It had
only one outlet to the sea — at Danzig; and the Vistula that found its
exit there was no defense against adjacent Prussia. The nation had no
ethnic unity: the Polish majority of its 6,500,000 souls (1715) was in
intermittent strife with German, Jewish, Lithuanian, and Russian
minorities; here the Teutons and the Slavs came face to face in
spontaneous hostility. There was no religious unity: the Roman Catholic
majority ruled and oppressed the “Dissidents”— themselves conten-
tiously divided between Protestants, Greek Orthodox, and Jews. There was
no political unity, for the jealously sovereign power lay in a Sejm, or
Diet, composed exclusively of nobles each of whom had, through the
liberum veto, the authority to nullify any proposal of all the rest, and
at will bring any session, any elected Diet, to an end. The king was
chosen by the Diet, and was subject to “conventions” signed by him as a
condition of his election; he could pursue no long-term policy with any
assurance of transmitting his crown or receiving steady support. The
nobles demanded such limitless power over legislation because each
wished to be completely free in ruling his lands and his serfs. But
limitation is the essence of liberty, for as soon as liberty is complete
it dies in anarchy. The history of Poland after Jan So- bieski was a
chronicle of anarchy.</p>
<p>Nearly all the soil was tilled by serfs in a feudal subjection from
which there was no appeal. The master was sometimes kind, but he was
always absolute. His serfs not only owed him such part of their produce
as he might demand; they were required also to give him gratis two or
three days of work each week on his manor. Fortunately the well- watered
land was fertile, and the peasants had enough to eat, but Coxe described
them as “poorer, humbler, and more miserable than any people we have yet
observed on our travels.” 1 Their local masters w ere the lower
nobility, or gentry (szlachta*), and these squires in turn were subject
to some hundred magnates owning or controlling immense areas. The gentry
held most of the executive offices in</p>

<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>

<p>he state, and theoretically they dominated the Sejm; actually Polish
politics was a strife of magnates or their families, manipulating
szlachta groups by economic influence or direct bribery. 2</p>
<p>In Poland the family still retained its primitive priority over the
state. The Radziwills, the Potockis, the Czartoryskis were severally
united by a senti- ment of family solidarity more intense than any
national bond; here patriotism was literally reverence for the father,
and above all for the oldest father. The family was strong as an
institution because it was the unit of economic pro- duction and moral
discipline; there was no economic individualism scattering the sons over
the country; normally the son remained on the patrimonial estate,
subject to paternal command as long as the father lived; the family
flourished through that same unity of authority whose absence weakened
the state. All the wealth of the family was under centralized
patriarchal control; in many cases it grew from year to year through the
reinvested profits of ex- ploitation and exportation, and in several
cases it exceeded the wealth of the king. Twenty Polish families in the
eighteenth century spent, each of them, over 200,000 livres per year on
their households. 3 Powerful families called their homes courts, with
retainers, private armies, numerous servants, and semiroyal displays; so
Prince Karol Radziwill, whose estate was half as large as Ireland, gave
in 1789 a feast to four thousand guests at a cost of a million marks.
4</p>
<p>The most famous of Polish families — so well- known that it was
called “the Family”— was the Czartoryskis. It had held princely rank
since the fifteenth century, and was related to the house of Jagiello,
which had ruled Poland from 1384 to 1572. Prince Kasimierz Czartoryski
(d. 1741), vice-chancellor of Lithuania, married Isabella Morstin, who
brought a further infusion of French culture into the family. By her he
had three children of note: ( 1 ) Fryderyk Michal Czartoryski, who
became grand chancellor of Lithuania; (2) Alexander Augustus
Czartoryski, who became Prince Palatine of “Red Russia”; and (3) Konst
antia, who married Stanislas Poniatowski I, and bore to him Stanislas
Poniatowski II, the most tragic figure in Polish history.</p>
<p>It was an added distinction of the Czartoryskis that their liberalism
grew with their wealth. They had long been known for their humane
treatment of their serfs; “if I had been born a serf,” said a
contemporary, “I should wish to be the serf of Prince [Alexander]
Augustus Czartoryski.” 5 They or - ganized schools for children,
supplied them with textbooks, built chapels, hospitals, model cottages.
To their estate and mansion in Pulawy (near Lub- lin) they brought
teachers and scholars who trained promising youths, from any class, for
the service of the state. Politically the Family opposed the liberum
veto as making effective government impossible. Against them were ranged
many families which felt that the veto was their sole protection against
a centralized autocracy. Strongest of these were the Potockis, led by
Prince Felix Potocki, who could ride thirty miles in one direction
without leaving his land — three million acres in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Industry and commerce, which in the sixteenth century had shared in
making Poland great and its towns prosperous, had been retarded by
the</p>
<p>474</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xhostility of the landowners and their obedient Diet. Many towns were
wholly within the private property of a magnate who, fearing the rise of
an independent middle class, favored agriculture against industry. The
com- petition of serf handicrafts on the manors had depressed the
artisans of the towns. “The ruin of the cities,” wrote Antoni Potocki in
1744, “is so evident that with the single exception of Warsaw the first
ones in the country can well be compared to dens of robbers.” 6 Grass
grew in the streets of Lvov, some city squares had become open fields,
and Cracow, formerly one of the great cultural centers of Europe, had
declined to a population of nine thou- sand, and its famous university
to six hundred students. 7</p>
<p>The decay of the towns was due in part to the Catholic reconquest of
Poland. Many of the displaced Protestants had been merchants or
artisans; their diminution in all but western Poland (where many Germans
remained) left the Polish scene to the landlords; and these were either
Roman Catholics or, in the east, Greek Orthodox or Uniates (Catholics
using the Eastern ritual but acknowledging the pope of Rome). The
Dissidents — Protestants, Greek Orthodox, and Jews, numbering eight per
cent of the population — were excluded from public office and the Diet;
all suits against them were tried be- fore completely Catholic courts. 8
Religious hostility reached the point where, in 1724, in predominantly
Protestant Torun (Thorn), the populace, infuri- ated by the behavior of
a Jesuit student, desecrated the Host and trampled upon an image of the
Virgin. Nine of the raiders were put to death. The Protestants of Poland
appealed to Prussia, the Greek Orthodox appealed to Russia; Prussia and
Russia offered protection, from which they progressed to invasion and
partition.</p>
<p>Polish morals resembled the German at table and the French in bed.
The peasants were inured to monogamy by care of the soil and their
brood, but in the capital it was made difficult by the beauty and the
“seductive man - ners” 9 of the women, who did not allow their superior
education to interfere</p>
<p>The literate Poles colored the scene with their dress. The peasant,
in sum- mer, made shift with shirt and knee breeches of coarse linen,
without stock- ings or shoes, and in winter he bundled himself up with
no care for color and no time for art; but the gentry, numbering some
725,000, wore boots, sword, plumed hat, a colored robe of silk or lace,
and, around the waist, a broad sash</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>of patterned fabrics in rich hues. This proudly national garb had
come up from Islam through the contact of the Lithuanians with Turks in
the</p>
<p>Ukraine; it reflected the occasional alliance of Poland with Turkey
against Austria or Russia; and perhaps it expressed an Asiatic element
in Polish man- ners and character.</p>
<p>Culturally Poland, from 1697 to 1763, was retarded by the
indifference of its Saxon kings to Slavic literature and art, and by two
devastating wars. The Catholic Church was not only the chief patron of
the arts, it was also the dispenser of education and the main repository
of learning and literature. It carefully quarantined Poland from the
movement of science and philosophy in the West, but within its limits it
spread and cultivated knowledge. Jozef Zaluski, bishop of Kiev, gathered
200,000 volumes at Warsaw into one of the greatest libraries of the age;
in 1748 he opened it to the public and presented it to the nation;
meanwhile he himself lived frugally, and sacrificed himself in the
struggle to preserve Poland’s independence.</p>
<p>It was he who turned the eager young priest Stanislas Konarski to the
study of history and law. In 1731 Konarski issued the first of four
volumes — Volu- mina legum — which codified Polish legislation from
Casimir the Great to his own time. These and other researches revealed
to Konarski how tragically Poland had fallen from her Renaissance
flowering. Convinced that regenera- tion could come only from the top,
he established in Warsaw (1740) a Col- legium Nobilium, where pedigreed
youths could receive an education not only in mathematics and the
classic languages and literatures (which the Jes- uits taught well) but
also in the natural sciences and modern languages. It was an heroic
task, for he had neither money nor textbooks, neither teachers nor
students; yet after fifteen years of labor he had made his College of
Nobles a famous and honored institution, one of the sources of the
cultural revival under Poniatowski, and of the enlightened constitution
of 1791. He appealed for a reform of the Polish language, seeking to rid
it of Latin phrases and flowering rhetoric; the nation protested, still
it learned. Konarski crowned his work by publishing (1760-63) the most
important political treatise of the century in Poland, innocently
entitled On the Effective Con- duct of Debates ; however containing a
blast against the liberum veto. Again there were many protests, but
after 1 764 no Diet was dissolved by the liberum veto. It was with
Konarski’s aid that Poniatowski began the reform of the Polish
constitution.</p>
<p>Before that brilliant and fitful resurrection Poland suffered
sixty-seven years of disorder, disgrace, and decline under Saxon
kings.</p>

<p>Other pages 13 have told how the Polish Diet passed over the son of
the great Sobieski to give the crown of Poland to Frederick Augustus,
Elector of Saxony, who embraced Catholicism overnight to become Augustus
II (the “Strong”) of Poland; how Charles XII of Sweden replaced him with
Stanis -</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>X47 6</p>
<p>las Leszczynski (1704), and how the defeat of Charles at Poltawa
(1709) allowed Augustus to regain his throne. He enjoyed few of the
legislative powers of an eighteenth-century monarch, but all the sexual
privileges of royalty. Failing to rule Poland, he turned his love back
to Saxony, beautified Dresden, filled himself with beer, and depleted
himself with mistresses; he added insult to injury by taking only one of
these from the Polish belles. Toward the end of his reign he planned to
partition Poland among Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, but he died
(February 1, 1733) before effecting this deviltry. On his deathbed he
said, “My whole life was one ceaseless sin.” 14 In morte veritas.</p>
<p>In the interregnum that ensued during the assembling of an electoral
Diet, French emissaries lavished livres to win deputies to the
restoration of Lesz- czynski. Since his deposition Stanislas had lived
in peace and hope in Alsace. In 1725 his daughter Marie had become queen
of France by marrying Louis XV ; now Louis expected his father-in-law,
if enthroned, to follow the French policy of aligning Poland with
Prussia and Turkey in a cordon around Austria. Feeling that such an
alliance would weaken Russia in her inevitable conflicts with Turkey and
Prussia, the Russian government dis- patched rubles to Warsaw to prevent
the election of Leszczynski. The livres outweighed the rubles, and on
September 10, 1733, Leszczynski became King Stanislas I of Poland.</p>
<p>A minority refused to recognize his election, and put themselves
under the protection of a Russian army that advanced to the Vistula and
proclaimed the Saxon Elector as King Augustus III of Poland (October 6).
So began the War of the Polish Succession, and the first decisive
interference of Russia in Polish affairs. Stanislas looked for a Polish
army to defend him; none existed except on paper; he fled to Danzig and
appealed to France for aid. The French government was then led by
Cardinal Fleury, who had no stomach for a war with distant Russia; he
sent a detachment of 2,400 soldiers; the Russians, with twelve thousand
men, overwhelmed it. Stanislas escaped from Danzig and retired to
Lorraine. In January, 1736, he signed his abdication; in July Augustus
III was acknowledged king.</p>
<p>But he was no more fit than Leszczynski to guide a nation which had
chaos built into its constitution. For a time he co-operated with the
Czartoryskis in attempts to end the liberum veto ; the Potocki
repeatedly used the veto to preserve it; Augustus gave up, comforted
himself in Dresden, and rarely visited Poland. Corruption continued and
flourished; unable to stop it, the King shared in it, selling offices to
the highest bidder. Magnates controlled the courts and the armed forces;
they negotiated directly with foreign powers, and received subsidies
from them. 15 France, Austria, Prussia, Russia maneu- vered to see which
could profit most from the imminent dissolution of the Polish state.</p>
<p>Before and after the death of Augustus III (October 5, 1763), the
compe- tition to name and rule his successor ran through every device of
diplomacy to the brink of war. The Potockis pleaded for a standing army
of 100,000 to protect Poland from foreign domination. The Czartoryskis
resigned them-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>selves to a Russian protectorate, and negotiated with Catherine II.
Russia claimed the right to protect the Greek Orthodox minority in
Poland, and stretched its memory to recall that the eastern Polish
provinces had been taken from Russia by St. Vladimir (956?-ioi5) eight
hundred years before. France favored the son of Augustus III to succeed
him; if Russia mastered Poland the whole structure of French foreign
policy in the East would col- lapse. Frederick the Great, who had just
concluded seven years of bitter war against France and Austria, needed
the friendship of Catherine, by whose permission he had escaped
disaster; he agreed to support her candidate for the Polish crown;
moreover, he signed with her (April n, 1764) a treaty secretly binding
both of them to oppose any changes in the constitution of either Poland
or Sweden, lest an increase in the royal power should make one or both
of these countries dangerously strong; they proposed to defend chaos in
the name of liberty. The Czartoryskis were appeased by Catherine’s prom
- ise to curtail the liberum veto after stability had been restored, and
by her choice of a Czartoryski protege as her candidate for the throne.
On Septem- ber 7, 1764, by the unanimous vote of a Diet convinced by
rubles and a Rus- sian army only three miles away, Stanislas Poniatowski
was chosen king.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PONIATOWSKI</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born to Stanislas Poniatowski the elder, governor of Cracow,
and to Konstantia Czartoryski, January 17, 1732. “I was brought up
very</p>
<p>strictly,” he told Mme. Geoffrin, “by a mother the like of whom you
will scarce find anywhere nowadays, while my father only preached to me
by his example.” I * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 16 At the age of sixteen
he began extensive travels. In 1753 he</p>
<p>captivated Mme. Geoffrin, her salon, and nearly all Paris by his
figure, his manners, and his youth. A few years later, following a
fashion of the time, he composed a self-portrait that accorded fairly
with the facts:</p>
<p>I should be content with my figure if only I were an inch taller,…
and</p>
<p>my nose less hooked, and my mouth a little smaller. With these
reservations I</p>
<p>believe that my face is noble and expressive, my figure not without
distinction.</p>
<p>… My shortsightedness often makes me look awkward, but only for an
in-</p>
<p>stant. Indeed I am rather apt to offend by the opposite extreme — too
haughty</p>
<p>a demeanor. An excellent education enables me to conceal my mental
and bodily defects, so that many people perhaps expect more from me than
I can</p>
<p>readily give. I have wit enough to take part in any conversation, but
not enough</p>
<p>o converse long and frequently. However, my natural sympathy and
amiabil-</p>
<p>ity often come to my assistance. I have a natural penchant toward
art…. My</p>
<p>indolence prevents me from going as far as I should like to go in the
arts and</p>
<p>sciences. I work either overmuch or not at all. I can judge very well
of affairs,… but I am very much in need of good counsel to carry out any
plan of my</p>
<p>own. I am very impressionable, but far more affected by sorrow than
by joy.</p>
<p>I am the first to be depressed…. When I love I love too
passionately….</p>
<p>I am not vindictive. Though in the first moment of irritation I may
long to</p>
<p>avenge myself upon my enemies, I am never able to carry out my
desire; com-</p>
<p>passion always comes between. 17</p>
<p>478</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XTo see — and express — himself so well suggests that Poniatowski was
born to think and write rather than to plan and do. He had met
Montesquieu and read Voltaire; he had acquired the intellectual polish
and subtlety of French society along with a degree of that “sensibility”
which was finding expres - sion in Rousseau. He was extremely sensitive
to women, and felt that what they gave him, in body and soul, was beyond
price. Rumor said that in Paris he was arrested for debt, and was
released after an hour’s imprisonment upon payment of 100,000 livres by
Mme. Geoff rin. 18</p>
<p>After five months in Paris, and having learned English, he went to
Eng- land, attended some sessions of Parliament, and aspired to remold
the Polish situation in the image of England as interpreted by
Montesquieu. Back from his travels (1754), he was appointed high steward
of Lithuania. A year later he accompanied Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams
to Russia, with results already noted. He returned home in 1756, but
went to St. Petersburg in 1757 as Polish ambassador. He shared in the
intrigue against Elizabeth in 1758, and was forced to leave Russia at
short notice. Catherine mourned his departure, but when she supported
him for the throne of Poland it was not because she still loved him, but
because (she said) he had less right than any other candi- date, and
should therefore be all the more grateful. 19 As for himself, he never
quite recovered from that exciting liaison; he remembered Catherine
before she had been hardened by power, and that fascination survived
even when she made him her tool in the subjection of his people.</p>
<p>Two days after his election he sent the news to Mme. Geoffrin:</p>
<p>My Dear Mama: It seems to me that I have greater pleasure in calling
you by that name since the day before yesterday. [His own mother was now
dead.] In all our history there has never been an election so tranquil
and so unani- mous…. All the principal ladies of the kingdom were
present on the Field of Election amid the squadrons of the nobility…. I
had the satisfaction of being proclaimed by the voices of all the women
as well as by those of all the men…. Why were you not there? You would
have named your son. 20 We have seen how “Mama” braved the roads of
Europe to visit her “son” in his palace at Warsaw (1766). Having no
realistic conception of the gap between French and Polish civilization,
she longed to have him pull Poland up a century in a year; her advice
became troublesome, and strained Ponia- towski’s filial devotion; he was
relieved when she left, thoug h he soothed her with compliments and a
picture of himself set in diamonds. She kept the pic- ture and sent back
the diamonds. Once away, her love for him returned to full fervor, and
she wrote to him from Vienna affirming for him “an affection which i s a
necessity of my life.” 21</p>
<p>Stanislas did his best. He gave himself dutifully, in these first
years, to the chores of government. He attended daily the deliberations
of his ministers, and worked till late at night on problems which he
undertook in conscien- tious detail. He succeeded in good measure in
training a civil-service corps of unusual competence and startling
integrity. 22 He made himself easily acces- sible, and charmed all by
his amiability, not all by his enthusiasm for reform. But his energy was
diluted by a sense of his dependence upon Catherine,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>even upon the Russian troops that she had left in Poland as a
guarantee of his security and obedience. Her ambassador, Count Otto von
Stackelberg, watched over him lest he forget his Russian strings.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by enemies far and near. The Polish nobility was
di- vided into two factions: one, led by the Potockis, agitated for
independence before reform, and wished to check the royal power by
keeping the aristoc- racy strong; the other, under the Czartoryskis,
asked for reform first, arguing that in its present disorder Poland was
too weak to throw off the Russian pro- tectorate. The Czartoryskis were
hesitant in the support of Poniatowski, for they deplored his
extravagances and his mistresses. The Diet allowed him 2,200,000 thalers
per year, and raised this, by 1786, to 6,143,000 gulden — one third of
the government’s revenue. He spent more than this allowance, having
borrowed from banks at home and abroad. Twice the state paid his debts;
yet in 1790 he still owed 1 1,500,000 gulden. 23 Like Catherine, he
aspired to make his reign memorable for fine buildings; he divided
himself and his retinue between two costly palaces; he gave expensive
entertainments, and lavished gifts upon artists, writers, and women.</p>
<p>His attractiveness was costly. Thirty-two at his accession, handsome,
cul- tured, generous, and unmarried, he gathered about him a swarm of
belles eager for his hand and his purse. Several who could not marry him
were glad to share his bed, and some Parisian actresses joined in
amusing the King. The Czartoryskis protested; he confessed his sins and
continued them. Finally one mistress, Pani Grabowska, led him to the
altar in a secret marriage. There- after his sexual life was under
strict surveillance, and he could give more attention to government,
literature, and the arts.</p>
<p>He took a personal interest in the works and the lives of the artists
and authors of the time. Like Catherine, he collected pictures,
statuary, and books, built a gallery and a library, and gave prominence,
in the latter, to a statue of Voltaire. He found work for native
artists, and brought in others from France, Italy, and Germany. Piranesi
and Canova could not come, but they executed works for him in Italy. He
transformed half the royal palace into a school of art, and provided
funds to enable promising young artists to study abroad. He established
near Warsaw a porcelain industry whose prod- ucts ranked with those of
Meissen and Sevres. He inspired well-to-do Poles — Adam Czartoryslci,
Elizabeth Lubomirska, Helen Radziwill, and others — to collect art, to
commission artists, and, in building and decorating their palaces, to
replace the rococo of the Saxon period with variations of the
neoclassical style. He himself favored a mixture of baroque and
classical; in this style Domenico Merlini designed the Lazienki Palace
on the outskirts of War- saw. Meanwhile foreign painters were training a
new generation of Polish artists, who came to maturity after Polish
liberty had disappeared.</p>
<p>The first moves toward that catastrophe were the obstacles placed by
Fred- erick the Great in the path of Poland’s self -reform. Thus far
(1767) Cather- ine seems to have had no intention to dismember a Poland
so obviously sub- ject to Russian influence; partition would enlarge
Prussia into a much more formidable barrier than Slavic Poland could be
to Russian participation in the</p>
<p>480</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xaffairs and culture of Western Europe. She was content to demand the
admis- sion of the Dissidents to full civil rights. But Frederick wanted
more. He could never reconcile himself to the fact that West Prussia,
predominantly German and Protestant, was subject to Polish and Catholic
rule. Hence some partition of Poland was with him an unforgettable
objective. Any strength- ening of Poland, political or military, would
hinder his aims; therefore his agents supported the liberum veto,
opposed the formation of a Polish national army, and welcomed the
quarrels of Catholics and Dissidents as offering a ground for
invasion.</p>
<p>The intolerance of the Roman Catholic hierarchy co-operated with
Fred- erick’s schemes. It resisted every attempt to admit the Dissidents
to civil rights. In “White Russia”— which was then a part of Poland, and
included Minsk — the Roman Catholic authorities took two hundred
churches from their Greek Orthodox congregations and gave them to the
Uniates; the Or- thodox communities were forbidden to repair their old
churches and to build new ones. In many cases children were separated
from their parents to be brought up in the Roman obedience. Orthodox
priests were ill-treated, and some were put to death. 24 Poniatowski,
child of the philosophes, favored toleration, 25 but he knew that the
Diet would fight, with force if necessary, any move to admit non-Roman
Catholics to its membership; and he felt that such proposals should be
deferred until some modification of the liberum veto could strengthen
his hand. Frederick and Catherine replied that they were asking no more
of Poland than they themselves were granting to their own religious
minorities. To the Diet that met in October 2nd November, 1766, Prussia,
Russia, Denmark, and Great Britain presented a petition that their
coreligionists in Poland should receive full civil rights.</p>
<p>Aroused by the eloquence of Bishop Kajetan Soltyk of Cracow, the
depu- ties rose to their feet in anger and demanded not only the
rejection of the petition, but the prosecution of its Polish supporters
as traitors to Poland and God. 26 A member who tried to defend the
petition narrowly escaped death. 27 Poniatowski sought to quiet the
assembly by issuing (November, 1766) a pamphlet called Considerations of
a Good Citizen, calling upon all Poles for national unity, and warning
them that a divided nation invited conquest. At the same time he begged
the Polish ambassador at St. Petersburg to detach Russia from the
petitioning powers. “If this [petition] be persisted in,” he wrote, “I
can see nothing but a St. Bartholomew’s Eve [Massacre] for the
Dissidents, and a harvest of Ravaillacs [assassins] for myself…. The Em-
press would make of my royal mantle a robe of Nessus. I shall have to
choose between renouncing h er friendship and being an enemy to my
country.” Catherine answered, through Nikolai Repnin, her ambassador at
Warsaw: “I cannot conceive how the King can fancy himself a traitor to
his country by simply supporting the demands of equity.” 28 She was too
far from Poland, in space and education, to feel the consuming heat of
Polish passion and pride. When a group of Protestant nobles formed a
confederacy at Thorn, and a Czartoryski faction formed a confederacy at
Radom, Catherine bade Repnin offer them the protection of Russia. Under
this pretext he brought eighty</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>housand Russian troops to the Polish border, and some of them into
Warsaw itself.</p>
<p>The Diet reconvened in October, 1767. Bishops Zaluski and Soltyk ex-
horted the deputies to stand firm against any change in the
constitution. Go- ing over Poniatowski’s head, Repnin arrested the
bishops and two laymen on the charge of having insulted the Empress, and
had them transported to Kaluga, ninety miles southwest of Moscow. The
Diet protested; Repnin announced that if further opposed he would deport
not four but forty mag- nates. On February 24, 1768, the Diet
surrendered to threats of war and signed with Russia a treaty accepting
all of Catherine’s demands: full free - dom of religious worship, and
eligibility to the Diet and public office, were granted to the
Dissidents; suits between Catholics and Dissidents were to be tried
before mixed courts. The Diet, Catherine, and Frederick were pleased
that the treaty confirmed the liberum veto, with some exceptions for
eco- nomic legislation. The Diet humbly accepted Catherine as the
protectress of this new constitution. In return she guaranteed the
territorial integrity of Poland so long as this entente continued. She
rejoiced that she had not only given Poland a greater degree of
religious liberty than even England enjoyed, but had foiled Frederick’s
plan for partition. Po niatowski received the con- gratulations of the
philosophers and the scorn of his people.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE FIRST PARTITION: 1 768-72</li>
</ol>
<p>Polish patriots and priests agreed with Frederick in not accepting
the situa- tion. The Roman Catholic clergy forcefully condemned the
surrender of Poland’s autonomy to a Russian infidel. Adam Krasinski,
bishop of Kamien - iec, and Jozef Pulaski (father of the Casimir Pulaski
who fought for Amer- ica) roused the Poles, by sermons and pamphlets, to
reassert their political freedom and religious dictatorship. Within a
week after the surrender of the Diet to Repnin a group of Poles formed
(February 29, 1768) the Confedera- tion of Bar — a town on the Dniester
in the Polish Ukraine. The magnates who financed the movement were
inspired by hatred of Catherine and the King; the “imbecile mass,” as
Frederick called their followers, burned with - nin reported to
Catherine. Poniatowski thought of joining the Confederation, but the
hotheads in it frightened him away by demanding his deposition, if not
his death. 29 If we may believe Voltaire, 30 thirty confederates took an
oath at Czestochowa:</p>
<p>We, excited by a holy and religious zeal, having resolved to avenge
the Deity, religion, and our country, outraged by Stanislas Augustus, a
despiser of</p>

<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xlaws both divine and human, a favorer of atheists and heretics, do
promise and swear, before the sacred and miraculous image of the Mother
of God, to ex- tirpate from the face of the earth him who dishonors her
by trampling upon religion…. So help us God!</p>
<p>Repnin ordered Russian troops to suppress the rebellion. They drove
the confederates over the Turkish border, and burned a Turkish town;
Turkey declared war upon Russia (1768), and demanded Russian evacuation
and liberation of Poland. Cossacks took advantage of the turmoil to
invade the Polish Ukraine, killing landlords, Jewish stewards, Roman
Catholic or Prot- estant peasants in an orgy of indiscriminate
slaughter; in one town they slew sixteen thousand men, women, and
children. The confederates retaliated by murdering all available
Russians and Dissidents, so that Protestants and Jews suffered double
jeopardy. Altogether in those years (1768-70), fifty thou- sand
inhabitants of Poland died by massacre or war. 31</p>
<p>All sides now began to talk of partition. The confederates were
charged by their enemies with having agreed to divide Poland between
themselves and their allies. 32 In February, 1769, Frederick sent to
St. Petersburg a pro- posal for dividing Poland among Russia, Prussia,
and Austria; Catherine re- plied that if Prussia and Austria would help
Russia to expel the Turks from Europe, she would consent to Prussian
appropriation of that part of Poland which separated mainland Prussia
from East Prussia — the remainder of Poland to be under a Russian
protectorate; 33 Frederick demurred. Choiseul, for France, suggested to
Austria that it should seize Polish territory adjoining Hungary: Austria
thought it a good idea in a good time, and in April, 1769, it occupied
the Polish province of Spiz, which had been mortgaged to Poland by
Hungary in 1412 and had never been redeemed. 34 In 1770 the Turks, then
at war as a defender of Poland, proposed to Austria a partition of
Poland between Austria and Turkey. 35</p>
<p>While these negotiations were proceeding, the Western powers resigned
themselves to the partitioning of Poland as the fated result of her
political chaos, her religious animosities, and her military impotence;
“the catastro phe was recognized as inevitable by every Continental
statesman.” 38 But the anti - Confederation Poles at this time sent a
member of the Diet to ask the socialist philosophe Mably and the
antiphilosophe Rousseau to draw up tentative con- stitutions for a new
Poland. Mably submitted his recommendations in 1770- 71; Rousseau
finished his Constitution of Poland in April, 1772 — two months after
the first partition treaty had been signed.</p>
<p>The Confederation of Bar had some moments of ecstasy before its
collapse. In March, 1770, from the Turkish city of Varna, it proclaimed
the deposi- tion of Poniatowski. On November 3, 1771, some confederates
intercepted him as he was leaving the house of an uncle at night,
overpowered his escort, shot one of them dead, dragged the King out of
his carriage, cut his head with a saber blow, and abducted him from the
capital. In the forest of Bielny they were attacked by a patrol; in the
melee Poniatowski escaped, and communi- cated with the Royal Guards, who
came and escorted him, disheveled and bloody, back to his palace at five
o’clock in the morning. All chances of</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>reconciliation between the government and the Confederation
disappeared. Poniatowski fell back upon Russian aid, and the
Confederation was sup- pressed, leaving a remnant in Turkey — the
Crescent protecting the Cross ( 1 7 7 2 ) - 37</p>
<p>Meanwhile the advance of Russia’s armies to the Black Sea and the
Danube disturbed both Prussia and Austria. Neither Frederick II nor
Joseph II took pleasure in contemplating Russian control of the Black
Sea, much less of Constantinople. By treaties of 1764 and 1766 Prussia
had pledged help to Russia if Russia should be attacked; Turkey was
formally the aggressor in the Russo-Turkish war of 1768; Prussia was now
endangering its solvency by sending subsidies to Russia. Austria,
resenting the entry of Russian forces into Wallachia, was threatening to
ally itself with Turkey against Russia; in that case Russia would expect
Prussia to attack Austria. But Frederick had had enough of war. He had
fought two wars to take and hold Silesia; why risk it now? He preferred
diplomacy. Perhaps the three powers could be appeased with servings of
Polish soil? As things were going, with the Russian ambassador the real
ruler of Poland, it was only a matter of time till Russia would
completely absorb the country, under whatever phrase. Was it still
possible to prevent this? Yes, if Catherine would consent to take only
eastern Poland, to let Frederick take western Poland, and to withdraw
from the Danube. Would a share in the spoils moderate Joseph’s
belligerency?</p>
<p>In January, 1771, Prince Henry, Frederick’s brother, proposed the
plan to the Russian diplomats at St. Petersburg. Panin objected that
Russia had guaranteed the territorial integrity of Poland; he was
reminded that this guarantee was conditional upon Poland’s adherence to
her new constitution and her alliance with Russia, and this adherence
had ceased when so many deputies joined the rebellious Confederation of
Bar. Even so, Catherine was reluctant. Why give Frederick a part of
Poland when she might soon take all? Why strengthen Prussia with
additional territory, resources, Baltic ports, and more six-foot troops?
But she did not want to fight Frederick; he had 180,000 men in arms; she
preferred to have him keep Joseph from uniting with Turkey against
Russia. Her present goal was not Poland but the Black Sea. On January 8,
1771, almost casually at a party, she indicated to Henry her tentative
consent to Frederick’s scheme.</p>
<p>A year passed before negotiation could settle the division of the
spoils. Frederick wanted Danzig; Catherine objected; so did Britain,
whose Baltic commerce anchored on that port. Meanwhile Austria
mobilized, and secretly allied itself with Turkey. On February 17, 1772,
Frederick and Catherine signed a “convention” for the partition of
Poland. Catherine softened Joseph by renouncing all Russian claims to
Wallachia and Moldavia; and the failure of the 1771 harvest had made it
impossible for him to feed his troops. On the other hand, Maria Theresa
was using all her tears to keep her son from join- ing in the rape.
Frederick and Catherine forced his hand by beginning actual seizure of
their self-assigned terrain. On August 5, 1772, Joseph added his
signature to the partition pact.</p>
<p>The treaty, after invoking the Blessed Trinity, agreed to let Poland
keep</p>
<p>484</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xwo thirds of her soil and one third of her population. Austria took
southern Poland between Volhynia and the Carpathians, with Galicia and
western Podolia — 27,000 square miles, 2,700,000 souls. Russia took
“White Russia” (eastern Poland to the Dvina and the Dnieper) — 36,000
square miles, 1,800,- 000 souls. Prussia took “West Prussia,” excepting
Danzig and Thorn— 1 3,000 square miles, 600,000 souls. Frederick took
the smallest share, but he had bound the conspirators to peace, and had
“sewed together,” as he put it, West Prussia and East Prussia with
Brandenburg. After all, said the patriotic Treit- schke, this was merely
restoring to Germany “the stronghold of the… Teutonic Order, the lovely
Weichsal Valley, which in days of yore the German knights had wrested
from the barbarians.” 38 Frederick reminded Europe that the population
of West Prussia was predominantly German and Protestant, and Catherine
pointed out that the region she had taken was peopled almost entirely by
Russian-speaking Greek Catholics. 39</p>
<p>The three powers soon occupied their shares with troops. Poniatowski
ap- pealed to the Western powers to prevent the partition; they were too
busy; France was expecting war with England, and hesitated to oppose her
ally Austria; England faced incipient revolt in America, with danger
from France and Spain; George III advised Poniatowski to pray to God. 40
The partitioning powers demanded that a Diet be called to confirm the
new geography; Poniatowski temporized for a year; Anally he summoned a
Diet to meet at Grodno. Many nobles and prelates refused to attend; some
who came and protested were sent to Siberia; others accepted bribes; the
rump Diet changed itself into a confederation (in which majority rule
was permitted by Polish law), and signed the treaty ceding the
expropriated territories (September 18, 1773). Poniatowski, like Maria
Theresa, wept and signed.</p>
<p>Western Europe accepted the first partition as the only alternative
to the complete absorption of Poland by Russia. Some diplomats, we are
told, “were startled by the moderation of the partners, who took only a
third when the whole was theirs for the asking.” 41 The philo sophes
rejoiced that an intoler - ant Poland had been chastened by their
enlightened despots; Voltaire hailed the partition as an historic
repulse of Vinjame 42 It was, of course, the triumph of organized power
over reactionary impotence.</p>
<p>V. THE POLISH ENLIGHTENMENT: 1 773-9 1</p>
<p>Poniatowski had to choose now between Russia and Prussia as his
protector and master. He chose Russia, for it was farther away, and only
Russia could prevent Frederick from taking Danzig and Thorn. Catherine
was anxious to prevent the further aggrandizement of Prussia, whose army
was the greatest obstacle to Russian aggrandizement in the West. She
ordered her ambassador in Warsaw to help Poniatowski in every way
consonant with Russian inter- ests, and she sent to the King the
proposals that Panin had drawn up for a more workable Polish
constitution. It retained elective monarchy and the liberum veto, but it
increased the royal power by establishing, under his</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>presidency and as his executive arm, a Permanent Council of
thirty-six mem- bers, divided into ministries of police, justice,
finance, foreign affairs, and war; and it provided for a regular army of
thirty thousand men. The nobles feared that such an army would endanger
their domination of the King; they reduced the figure to eighteen
thousand; but, with this and some minor ex- ceptions, the Diet of 1775
ratified the new constitution, and Poniatowski could now proceed to
restore some health to the nation.</p>
<p>Corruption continued but anarchy diminished, guerrilla bands were
over- come, and the national economy grew. Rivers were deepened for
large vessels, canals were dug between rivers, and a “Royal Canal,”
completed in 1783, connected the Baltic with the Black Sea. Between 1715
and 1773 the population of Poland grew from 6,500,000 to 7,500,000, and
the state revenue was doubled. A system of national schools was
established, textbooks were prepared and provided, the universities of
Cracow and Wilno were re- endowed and revitalized, and teachers’
colleges were established and financed by the state. Poniatowski liked
to surround himself with poets, journalists, and philosophers. “The
King,” reported Coxe, “gives a dinner every Thurs - day to the men of
letters who are most conspicuous for learning and abilities, and his
Majesty himself presides at table,” 43 leading the discussion of books
and ideas. He took three authors to live with him, and quietly added to
the income of others. 44 Thousands of Poles, while making their
courteous obei- sance to the Church — even while serving as its priests
— read Locke, Montes- quieu, Voltaire, Diderot, d’Alembert, and
Rousseau. The foundations were laid of the Polish, or Stanislavian,
Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Adam Naruszewicz, a Jesuit, caught the ear of the King by his poems;
he was raised to a bishopric, but continued to indite lyrics to nature;
his “Hymn to the Sun” and his “Four Seasons” still endear him to those
who can read him in the original. His Satires used a popular vocabulary
sometimes Rabe- laisian or profane. Stanislas asked him to write a
readable but scholarly his- tory of Poland; Naruszewicz gave nine years
to the task, and in six volumes (1780-86) produced a work remarkable for
its discriminate documentation. He lost heart after the second
partition, fell into melancholy, and survived the final partition by
only a year 45</p>
<p>The outstanding Polish writer of the period was Ignacy Krasicki. In
his travels he won the friendship of Voltaire and Diderot. 46 He became
a priest, ultimately an archbishop, but Stanislas urged him to give rein
to his poetic gifts. In a mock-heroic Mousiad (1775) he satirized the
wars of his time as battles between rats and mice; in Monomachia (1778)
he made fun of monas- tic disputes — the deadly weapons being
theological tomes. Turning to prose, he told, in The Adventures of
Mr. Nicholas Find-Out (1776), how a young Polish noble, equipped with
all fashionable attainments and sentiments, and wrecked on a strange
island, discovered how men and women, though in a “state of nature,”
could be industrious and virtuous. Having followed the lead of Homer,
Swift, and Defoe in these works, Krasicki took up the style of Addison,
and produced a series of genre pictures, Pan Podstoli (1778 f.),
describing the life of a model gentleman and citizen. In Fables and
Parables</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>X(1779) he challenged Phaedrus and La Fontaine, and struck with
trenchant irony at the dishonesty and brutality that flourished about
him. His final ad- vice was Horatian: seek a quiet corner, and let
happiness come by stealth. 47</p>
<p>Although the influence of the French Enlightenment upon Naruszewicz
and Krasicki was sacerdotally subdued, it appeared decisively in
Stanislas Trembecki, who never mentioned religion except with hostility.
His poetry idolized nature, but not in those pleasant aspects that most
often stir senti- ment; he liked rather her wilder phases — her mad
profusion of plants and animals, her storms and torrents, the strife of
life with life, of eaten with eater; his fables took their form from La
Fontaine but their spirit from Lu- cretius. The power, subtlety, and
finish of his verse won him a high place in this literary flowering.
Poniatowski supported him through all his trials, and when the King was
deposed the poet accompanied him into exile, and stayed with him till
death.</p>
<p>There was much religious poetry, for religion was the ultimate
consolation of the Poles in their personal and national misfortunes.
Franciszek Karpinski’s “Morning Song,” “Evening Song,” and “Christ Is
Being Born” are literature as well as piety. Franciszek Kniaznin passed
readily between those ancient enemies, religion and sex: on the verge of
ordination he discovered Anacreon and love; he published Erotica (1770),
pursued worldly happiness, returned to religion, and died insane. The
attempt to reconcile opposites may lead to madness as well as to
philosophy.</p>
<p>In the drama the dominant figure was Wojciecz Boguslawski, whom his
countrymen honor as “the father of the Polish theater”; we might call
him the Garrick of Poland, but the Poles would call Garrick the
Boguslawski of England. He was apparently the first Pole who gave his
entire career to the stage — as actor, dramatist, and producer, as
director of permanent theaters in Warsaw and Lvov, and as manager of
companies that spread an appreciation of the drama throughout the
provinces and over the frontiers. He presented Shakespeare and Sheridan
in translation, and himself wrote comedies some of which still hold the
Polish stage. The best play of this period was The Deputy’s Return, by
Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, himself a deputy; here the two sides of the
political crisis were dramatically pictured in the devotion of a reform
deputy to a girl whose parents defend the privileges of the magnates and
the ways of the past.</p>
<p>Last and greatest of the Polish illumines was Hugo Kollontaj. His
educa- tion infected him with the ideas of the philosophes, but he
concealed his heresies sufficiently to secure a comfortable canonry at
Cracow. Poniatowski appointed him (1773) to an Education Committee, for
which Kollontaj, aged twenty-three, drew up a program of educational
reform quite up to the best of its time. At twenty-seven he was
entrusted with the reorganization of Cra- cow University; he carried
this through in a few years, and then remained as rector. In Letters of
an Anonymous Writer to the President of the Diet (1788-89), and in The
Political Law of the Polish Nation (1790), he offered proposals which
became the basis of the constitution of 1791.</p>
<p>Prodded by its poets and publicists, Poland struggled to transform
itself into an effective and defensible state. An opportunity came when,
to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OF POLAND</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>“Four Years’ Diet” of 1788 - 92, Frederick II’s successor, Frederick
Wil - liam II, offered an alliance that pledged protection by the
powerful Prussian army against any foreign interference. Russia was busy
with war against both Turkey and Sweden; now Poland might deliver itself
from its long sub- servience to Catherine, and from such depredations as
Russian soldiers had committed on Polish soil during the last
twenty-five years. Over Poniatow- ski’s protests the Diet dissolved his
Permanent Council, voted to raise, subject to the Diet, an army of
100,000 men, and ordered Russian troops to leave Poland at once (May,
1789). Catherine, needing all her forces elsewhere, made no resistance,
but vowed revenge. On March 29, 1790, the Diet signed alliance with
Prussia.</p>
<p>By this time Poniatowski too was intoxicated with the air of freedom.
Throwing off his allegiance to Catherine, he took the lead in drafting a
new constitution. Its terms made the monarchy hereditary, but assured
the suc- cession, after the childless Poniatowski’s death, to the house
of Saxony. The executive powers of the Crown were to be enlarged by
giving the king a suspensive veto — i.e., the right to prevent a measure
passed by one Diet from becoming law until reaffirmed by the next. The
king was to appoint his min- isters and the bishops, and to have command
of the army. A small number of burghers and other townsmen were to be
elected as deputies. The Diet was to consist of two chambers: a House of
Deputies, which alone could originate laws; and a Senate — composed of
bishops, provincial governors, and the king’s ministers — whose consent
was to be necessary to any law. The liberum veto was to be replaced by
majority rule. Roman Catholicism was to be recognized as the prevailing
religion of the nation, and apostasy from it was made a crime; but
otherwise freedom of worship was guaranteed to all. Serfdom re- mained,
but peasants might now appeal from the patrimonial to a provincial or
national court. The influence of the constitution adopted by the United
States of America (1787-88) was evident in these recommendations; Poles
who had fought for the American colonies had prepared the mind of Ponia-
towski, and he had not forgotten his reading of Locke, Montesquieu, and
the philosophes.</p>
<p>To ensure the ratification of his proposals Poniatowski resorted to a
ruse. Many members of the Diet went home for the Easter holy days of
1791; the King summoned it to reconvene on May 3, too soon to let
distant members return to Warsaw for the reopening; those nearby
deputies who arrived on time were mostly liberals who could be depended
upon to support the new constitution. It was offered to them in the
royal palace as soon as they con- vened; it was received with wild
acclaim, and was ratified by a large majority. That day, May 3, 1791,
was proudly remembered by patriotic Poles, and was celebrated in Polish
literature, art, and song.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>DISMEMBERMENT: 1 792-95</li>
</ol>
<p>All the powers except Russia recognized the new constitution. Edmund

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xdeclared that Stanislas II had earned a place among the greatest
kings and statesmen in history; 48 but this enthusiasm may have
reflected England’s pleasure at Catherine’s defeat.</p>
<p>The Empress concealed for a time her hostility to the new Poland. But
she did not forgive the expeditious expulsion of her troops, nor the
replacement of Russian with Prussian influence in Polish affairs. When
the Peace of Jassy (January 9, 1792) ended her war with Turkey, and the
involvement of Prussia and Austria in war against Revolutionary France
(April, 1792) freed her from fear of her former accomplices, she looked
around for another opening into Poland.</p>
<p>It was provided for her by conservative Poles. They quite agreed with
Catherine that Poniatowski’s constitution h ad been approved by a Diet
so hastily assembled that many nobles had been unable to attend. Felix
Potocki and other magnates were furious at the abandonment of that
liberum veto which had insured their power against any central
authority, and they were unwilling to surrender their right to elect —
and therefore dominate — the king. Refusing to take an oath of loyalty
to the new charter, Potocki led a group of nobles to St. Petersburg and
asked the Empress to help them restore the older constitution (of 1775)
which she had promised to protect. She an- swered that she did not care
to interfere in Poland at the request of a few individuals, but that she
would consider an appeal from a substantial organ- ized Polish minority.
Informed of these negotiations, Frederick William II, involved against
France and unwilling to wage war against Russia, informed the Polish
government (May 4, 1792) that if it intended to defend its new
constitution by force of arms, it must not expect support from Prussia.
49 Potocki returned to Poland, formed (May 14, 1792) in a little town of
the Ukraine the Confederation of Targowica, and invited to his standard
all those who wished to restore tht old constitution. His followers
called themselves Republicans, condemned the alliance of Poland with
Prussia, praised Cath- erine, and begged for her blessing and her
troops.</p>
<p>She sent both, and, so strengthened, the confederates marched toward
Warsaw. Their propaganda for “freedom” made some impression, for several
towns received them as liberators; and at Teresapol (September 5)
Potocki was hailed as in effect the new king of Poland. Poniatowski
called upon the Diet to give him all powers needed for defense. It
appointed him dictator, summoned all adult male Poles to military
service, and adjourned. Stanislas made his nephew, the
twenty-nine-year-old Prince Jozef Poniatowski, com- mander in chief of
the army, which he found untrained and miserably equipped. Jozef ordered
all detachments of the army to join him at Lubar on the River Slucz; but
many had been surrounded by Russian forces, and could not come, and
those that came were too weak to withstand the Russian advance. The
young commander withdrew to Polonne, his center of supplies, in an
orderly retreat made possible by the valiant rear-guard action of
Thaddeus Kosciusko, who had fought for the colonies in America, and was
already, at forty-six, old in the honors of patriotism and war.</p>
<p>On June 17, 1792, the Poles encountered a major Russian army at
Zielence,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>THE RAPE OK POLAND</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>and defeated it in the first pitched battle won by Poland since
Sobieski’s days. Here again Kosciusko proved his skill, by seizing a
hill from which his artil- lery commanded the field; and Jozef, hitherto
distrusted by subordinates twice his age, won their respect by leading
his reserves in person to force the retreat of the Russians. The report
of this victory rejoiced Poniatowski, but was almost outweighed by news
that Prince Ludwig of Wurttemberg, a Prussian-army commander in charge
of the Polish forces in Lithuania, had deserted his post, leaving his
troops in such disarray that on June 1 2 the Rus- sians easily captured
Wilno, the Lithuanian capital.</p>
<p>Jozef’s army remained the sole defense of Poland. Its supplies were
so low that some of its regiments fasted for twenty-four hours, and only
a dozen charges of ammunition were left in the artillery. The Prince
ordered retreat to Dubno; accused of cowardice, he took a stand at
Dubienka (July 18), and with 12,500 men fought 28,000 Russians to a
draw. He fell back in good order to Kurow, where he awaited the
reinforcements and supplies that had been promised him by the King.</p>
<p>But Stanislas had given up. The refusal of Frederick William II to
honor the terms of the Prusso-Polish alliance, the treachery of Prince
Ludwig, the hundreds of desertions from the army that he had collected
at Praga, had been too much for his never very valiant spirit. He sent a
personal appeal to Catherine for some honorable terms; her reply (July
23) was an ultimatum requiring him to join the Confederation of
Targowica, and to restore the constitution of 1775. He was shocked by
her uncompromising tone; was this the same woman who had once responded
to his reckless love?</p>
<p>It was his tenderness that now dominated him. He had thought of
resisting, of arming himself and going to the front to lead a forlorn
defense; but his wife, his sister, and his niece wept so copiously at
the thought of his death and their own desolation that the King promised
he would yield. And, after all, of what use would resistance be? Now
that no help — now that attacks on the undefended western front — could
be expected from Prussia, how could Poland stand against Russia? Had he
not striven to dissuade the Diet from flouting Catherine and risking all
on the promises of Prussia? Had he not pleaded for a large army properly
equipped, and had not the Diet, after vot- ing the men, refused the
funds? Even if the existing Polish army won a vic- tory or two over the
Russians, could not Catherine, surfeited with soldiers by peace with
Turkey, send wave after wave of disciplined and well-armed troops
against his scattered and disorganized remnants? Why sacrifice more
lives, and surrender half of Poland to devastation, when surrender would
be the end in any case?</p>
<p>The new Russian ambassador, Yakov Sievers, sent to his sister a
sympa- thetic picture of Poniatowski in this hour of physical and
spiritual collapse:</p>
<p>The King is still [at sixty] a handsome man who wears well, though
his face is pale, but one can see that a dark veil has been drawn over
his soul. He speaks well, and even eloquently, and is courteous and
attentive always and to every- one. He is lodged badly, slighted,
despised, and betrayed; and yet he is the most amiable of men. Leaving
his high position out of the question, and re-</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xgarding him simply from the personal point of view, I may say that
his good</p>
<p>? [ualities outweigh his bad ones. Certainly, after Louis XVI, he is
the most un- ortunate of monarchs. He loves his kinsfolk most tenderly,
and it is just these very people who have been the cause of all his
misfortunes. 50</p>
<p>On July 24, 1792, Poniatowski read the Russian ultimatum to his privy
councilors, and advised them to trust to Catherine’s magnanimity. Many
councilors protested against such simplicity. One of them, Malachowski,
offered to raise within an hour 100,000 gulden for defense, and urged
that even if Warsaw had to be abandoned, the Polish troops could retreat
to Cra- cow and raise a new army in the populous south. Poniatowski’s
motion to surrender was defeated in the Council by a vote of twenty to
seven. By his authority as dictator he overruled them, and ordered his
nephew to make no further resistance. Jozef replied that instead of such
capitulation the King should hasten to the front with what forces he
could gather, and fight to the end. When Stanislas insisted that the
army must join the Confederation, all the officers but one sent in their
resignations, and Jozef returned to his former home in Vienna. On August
5 a Russian army occupied Praga. In October Jozef sent a plea to his
uncle to abdicate before every shred of honor had gone. In November
Potocki, with the advance guard of the Confederation, made a triumphal
entry into Warsaw, and lectured Poniatowski on the duties of a king. But
Potocki’s victory was soon seen to be a calamity, for in Janu - ary,
1793, Prussian troops entered Poland, and then moved on to occupy Danzig
and Thorn, without Potocki’s Russian allies raising a musk et to pre-
vent them. It became clear that Russia and Prussia had agreed to
partition Poland again.</p>
<p>Catherine and Frederick William had signed such an agreement on Janu-
ary 23, but they kept it secret till February 28. Potocki appealed to
Poles of all parties to rise in defense of Poland; they laughed at him;
Jozef denounced him as the betrayer of his country, and challenged him
to single combat; Stanislas forbade the duel.</p>
<p>By the second partition Russia took 89,000 square miles of eastern
Poland, with 3,000,000 population, including Wilno and Minsk; Prussia
took 23,000 square miles of western Poland, with 1,000,000 population,
including Danzig and Thorn; Poland retained 80,000 square miles and
4,000,000 souls — approx- imately one half of what had been left to her
in 1773. Austria had no share in this second spoliation, but was
mollified by Russo-Prussian promises to aid her in acquiring Bavaria.
The Western powers, still absorbed in the struggle with Revolutionary
France, took no action against this second rape, which Catherine
explained to them as made necessary by the development of revolu-
tionary agitation in Warsaw, endangering all monarchies.</p>
<p>To give the theft a garb of legality she ordered Poniatowski to
summon a Diet to meet at Grodno, and bade him come there in person to
sign an alli- ance with Russia. At first he declined to go, but when she
offered to pay his debts — which now amounted to 1,566,000 ducats — he
accepted this added humiliation for the sake of his creditors. The
Russian ambassador was sup- plied with funds to bribe a sufficient
number of deputies to attend the Diet,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX ) THE RAPE OF POLAND 49 1</p>
<p>and he found it easy to corrupt several members of the King’s suite
to report every wor d and action of their master. This “Last Diet” (June
17 to Novem - ber 24, 1793) was persuaded to sign a treaty with Russia,
but it refused for months to ratify the second partition. Told that they
would not be allowed to leave the hall till they had signed, the members
still refused, and sat in silence for twelve hours. Then the marshal put
the question to a vote, and, hearing no answer, declared that silence
was consent (September 25). The residue of Poland became again a Russian
protectorate; the constitution of 1775 was restored.</p>
<p>If one man could redeem the nation it was Kosciusko. Financed by the
Czartoryskis, he went to Paris (January, 1793), and besought the help of
France for a Poland warmly sympathetic with the French Revolution. He
promised that if help came the Polish peasants would rise against
serfdom, the townsmen against the nobility; Poniatowski would abdicate
in favor of a republic, and a Polish army would support France in its
war with Prussia. 51 The French leaders welcomed his proposals, but the
outbreak of war with England (February, 1793), and the invasion of
France by the Allies, ended all chance of aid to Poland.</p>
<p>During Kosciusko’s absence some burghers, Freemasons, and army
officers raised a new Polish army (March, 1794). Kosciusko hurried from
Dresden to Cracow to join it; he was appointed commander in chief with
dictatorial powers; he ordered every five houses in Poland to send him a
foot soldier, every fifty houses a cavalryman, and bade these recruits
to bring whatever weapons they could muster, even pikes and scythes. On
April 4, with four thousand regulars and two thousand peasant recruits,
Kosciusko attacked a force of seven thousand Russians at Raclawice, near
Cracow, and defeated it partly by his generalship, partly by the
effectiveness of the peasants’ scythes.</p>
<p>On hearing of this victory the radical, or “Jacobin,” element in
Warsaw organized an insurrection. Middle-class leaders hesitantly joined
it. On April 17 these rebels attacked the Russian garrison of 7,500 men,
slew many of them, and defeated a Prussian contingent of 1,650 troops;
the occupation forces fled, and for a moment Warsaw was under Polish
control. A similar uprising freed Wilno (April 23), hanged the Grand
Hetman of Lithuania, and regained parts of Poland almost to Minsk. On
May 7 Kosciusko promised liberation to the serfs, and guaranteed
ownership of the lands they tilled. So many volunteers and conscripts
came to his standard that by June of 1794 he commanded 1 50,000 men,
only 80,000 of them properly equipped.</p>
<p>Against them came wave after wave of disciplined Russian or Prussian
troops. On June 6 an allied army of 26,000 surprised the Poles near
Szczeko- ciny; Kosciusko had time to bring up only 14,000 men. He was
beaten with heavy losses; he sought death in battle, but it evaded him;
the Polish remnant retired to Warsaw. On June 15 the Prussians took
Cracow; on August 1 1 the Russians recaptured Wilno; on September 19 a
Polish army of 5,500 men was annihilated at Teresapol by a Russian force
of 12,500 seasoned soldiers under Suvorov; on October 10 Kosciusko
himself, with 7,000 Poles, was over- whelmed by 1 3,000 Russians at
Maciejowice; he was seriously wounded and</p>
<p>492 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xwas taken prisoner. He did not, as legend supposed, utter the
despairing cry “ Finis Poloniae!” but that defeat was the end of the
heroic revolt.</p>
<p>Suvorov, uniting various Russian armies, stormed the entrenched* camp
of the Poles at Praga, and his battle-crazed troops slaughtered not only
the de- fenders but the civilian population of the town. Poniatowski
surrendered Warsaw to avoid a greater massacre. Suvorov dispatched
Kosciusko and other rebel leaders to imprisonment at St. Petersburg, and
sent the King to Grodno to await the pleasure of the Empress. There, on
November 25, 1795, he signed his abdication. He appealed to Catherine to
let some part of Poland survive, but she determined to solve the Polish
question by putting an end, as she thought, to the Polish nation. After
fifteen months of dispute Russia, Prussia, and Austria signed the Third
Partition Treaty (January 26, 1797). Russia took Kurland, Lithuania, and
western Podolia and Volhynia — 181,000 square miles; Austria took
“Little Poland,” with Cracow and Ludlin— 45,000 square miles; Prussia
received the remainder, with Warsaw — 57,000 square miles. By all three
partitions Russia absorbed some 6,000,0 00 of Poland’s 12, - 200,000
souls ( 1797), Austria 3,700,000, Prussia 2,500,000.</p>
<p>Thousands of Poles fled from their country; aliens received the
confiscated properties. Poniatowski remained in Grodno, playing at
botany and writing memoirs. After Catherine’s death Paul I invited him
to St. Petersburg and assigned him the Marble Palace and 100,000 ducats
a year. There he died, February 12, 1798, in his sixty-sixth year.
Kosciusko was freed by Emperor Paul in 1796, returned to America, then
to France, and continued his efforts for Polish liberation till his
death (1817). Jozef Poniatowski escaped to Vienna, joined in Napoleon’s
campaign against Russia, was wounded at</p>
