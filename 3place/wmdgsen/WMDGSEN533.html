<h4 id="chapter-xv-mozart">CHAPTER XV Mozart</h4>
<p>I. THE WONDERFUL BOY: 1756-66</p>
<p>S ALZBURG, like Prague and Pressburg and Esterhaza, was a musical
out- post of Vienna. It had its own character, partly from the salt
mines that ex- plain its name, partly from its environing mountains and
its bisecting Salzach River, partly from having grown up around the
monastery and episcopal see founded there about a.d. 700 by St. Rupert
of Worms. The archbishop had been made an Imperial prince in 1278, and
from that time till 1802 he was the civic as well as the ecclesiastical
ruler of the city. In 1731-32 some thirty thousand Protestants had been
forced to migrate, leaving Salzburg thor- oughly and theocratically
Catholic. Otherwise the archiepiscopal rule rested lightly on an
orthodox population which, assured of eternal certainties, de- voted
itself to epidermal contacts and other worldly joys. Sigismund von
Schrattenbach, archbishop during Mozart’s youth, was especially genial
and kindly, except to heretics.</p>
<p>To this lovely town Leopold Mozart had come in 1737, aged eighteen,
from his native Augsburg, presumably to study theology and become a
priest. But he lost his heart to music, served for three years as
musician and valet in a patrician’s home, and in 1743 became fourth
violinist in the Arch - bishop’s orchestra. When he married Anna Maria
Pertl (1747) he and she were rated the handsomest couple in Salzburg. He
composed concertos, Masses, symphonies, and wrote a long-honored
textbook of violin technique. In 1757 he was appointed court composer to
the Archbishop. Of his seven children only two survived childhood: Maria
Anna (Marianna, “Nannerl”), born 1751, and Wolfgang Amadeus, born
January 27, 1756. (The boy’s full name — soliciting the intercession of
several saints — was Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart;
Theophilus was translated from Greek into Latin as Amadeus, Lover of
God.) Leopold was a good husband and father, devoted and industrious.
His letters to his son are warm with love, and not wanting in wisdom.
The Mozart home — allowing for a little obscenity — was a haven of
mutual affection, parental piety, childish pranks, and music without
end.</p>
<p>Every German child was expected to become in some measure, on some
instrument, a musician. Leopold taught his children mus ic with their
ABC’s. Marianna was already at eleven a virtuoso at the clavichord.
Wolfgang, stimulated by her lead, took eagerly to the clavier: at three
he picked out chords; at four he played several pieces from memory; at
five he invented compositions which the father put on paper as they were
played. Leopold refrained, at some cost, from taking other pupils,
wishing to give full atten- tion to his children. He did not send “Wolf”
to school, for he proposed to be</p>
<p>382</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>383</p>
<p>his teacher in everything. Presumably some German discipline was
used, but not much was needed in this case; the boy would of his own
accord remain at the keyboard for hours on end till forced away. 1 Years
later Leopold wrote to him:</p>
<p>Both as a child and as a boy you were serious rather than childlike;
and when you were at the clavier, or otherwise engaged with music, you
would not suffer the least joking to go on with you. Your very
countenance was so serious that many observant persons prophesied your
early death, on the ground of your precocious talent and earnest mien.
2</p>
<p>In January, 1762, while Germany was still torn with war, Leopold took
daughter and son to Munich to display their artistry before the Elector
Max- imilian Joseph; and in September he led them to Vienna. They were
invited to Schonbrunn; Maria Theresa and Francis I were delighted with
the chil- dren; Wolfgang leaped into the Empress’ lap, hugged and kissed
her; chal - lenged by the Emperor, he played the violin with one finger,
and played the clavichord unerringly though the keys were covered with a
cloth. Romping with the princesses, Wolfgang stumbled and fell; the
Archduchess Maria An- tonia, seven years old, picked him up and
comforted him. “You are good,” he said, and gratefully added, “I will
marry you.” 3 A dozen aristocrats opened their homes to the Mozarts,
marveled at the music they heard, and re- warded the trio with money and
gifts. Then the boy was bedded for a fort- night with scarlet fever —
the first of many illnesses that were to mar his travels. In January,
1763, the troupe returned to Salzburg.</p>
<p>The indulgent Archbishop overlooked the fact that Leopold had
exceeded his leave of absence; indeed, he promoted him to be
Vize-Kapellmeister. But on June 9, forfeiting further promotion, Leopold
took to the road again, this time with his wife, to show his brood to
Europe; after all, they could not re- main child prodigies forever. At
Mainz the children gave two concerts, at Frankfurt four; sixty years
later Goethe recalled that he had heard one of these, and how he had
marveled at “the little man with wig and sword”— for so Leopold had
accoutered his son. Wolfgang was exploited by his father as almost a
circus wonder. An announcement in a Frankfurt newspaper of Au- gust 30,
1 763, promised that in the concert of that evening</p>
<p>he little girl, who is in her twelfth year, will play the most
difficult composi - tions of the greatest masters; the boy, who is not
yet seven, will perform on the clavichord or harpsichord; he will also
play a concerto for the violin, and will accompany symphonies on the
clavier, the keyboard being covered with a cloth, with as much facility
as if he could see the keys. He will instantly name all notes played at
a distance, whether singly or in chords, on the clavier or on any other
instrument — bell, glass, or clock. He will finally, both on the
harpsichord and the organ, improvise as long as may be desired, and in
any key. 4</p>
<p>Such demands upon the boy’s talent s may have done some damage to his
health or nerves, but he seems to have enjoyed the applause as much as
his father enjoyed the florins.</p>
<p>They played at Coblenz, were disappointed at Bonn and Cologne, but
had a concert at Aachen. At Brussels they expected that the
governor-general,</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>384</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>Prince Charles of Lorraine, would honor their performance with his
presence, but he was busy. Leopold angrily reported:</p>
<p>We have now been nearly three weeks in Brussels… and nothing has hap-
pened…. His Highness does nothing but hunt, gobble, and swill, and we
may in the end discover that he has no money…. I own that we have
received sundry presents here, but we do not wish to convert them into
cash…. What with snuffboxes and leather cases and such-like gewgaws, we
shall soon be able to open a stall. 5</p>
<p>The Prince finally agreed to attend; a concert was given, florins
were col- lected, and the troupe encoached for Paris.</p>
<p>On November 15, 1763, they arrived in Paris after tumbling three days
on rough and rutted roads. They had letters of introduction to many
notables, but none proved so valuable as the one to Melchior Grimm. He
arranged to have the Mozarts received by Mme. de Pompadour, by the royal
family, finally by Louis XV and Queen Marie Leszczinska. Now the most
lordly homes were opened to the visitors, private and public concerts
went off well, and Grimm wrote enthusiastically to his clientele:</p>
<p>True miracles are rare, but how wonderful it is when we have the
opportu- nity to see one! A Salzburg Kapellmeister by the name of Mozart
has just come here with two of the prettiest children in the world. His
daughter, aged eleven, plays the piano in the most brilliant fashion,
performs the longest and most difficult pieces with astounding
precision. Her brother, who will be seven next February, is such an
extraordinary phenomenon that you can hardly believe what you see with
your own eyes…. His hands are hardly big enough to take a sixth…. He
improvises for an hour, yielding himself to the inspiration of his
genius, with a wealth of delightful ideas…. The most consummate
Kapellmeister cannot possibly have so deep a knowledge of harmony and
mod- ulation as this child…. It is nothing for him to decipher whatever
you put before him. He writes and composes with marvelous ease, and does
not find it necessary to go to the piano and look for his chords. I
wrote out a minuet for him and asked him to put a bass to it. He seized
a pen, and without going to the piano he wrote the bass…. The child will
turn my head if I listen to him much more…. What a pity that so little
is understood of music in this coun- try ! 6</p>
<p>After many triumphs in Paris the family departed for Calais (April
10,</p>
<p>1764). In London they were received by George III. For four hours, on
May 19, before King and court, Wolfgang played Handel and Bach and other
masters at sight; he accompanied Queen Charlotte’s singing, and
improvised a new melody to the bass of a Handel aria. Johann Christian
Bach, who had settled in London in 1762, placed the boy on his knee and
played a sonata with him, each playing a bar i n turn, “with so much
precision that no one would have suspected two performers.” 7 Bach began
a fugue, Wolfgang pursued it, again as if the two geniuses were one.
Thereafter, for several years, Mozart’s compositions showed the
influence of Johann Chris tian Bach. On June 5 the children gave a
concert which gladdened Leopold with a hundred guineas net. But the
father was afflicted with severe inflammation of the throat, and the
family retired to Chelsea for seven weeks’ rest, during which Wolfgang,
now eight, composed two symphonies (K. 16 and 19).</p>

<p>MOZART</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>On July 24, 1765, they left London for Holland, but at Lille both
father and son took sick, and the tour was halted for a month, though
Archbishop von Schrattenbach had long ago called for Leopold’s return.
They reached</p>
<p>They dallied at Dijon as guests of the Prince de Conde; they spent
four weeks at Lyons, three at Geneva, one in Lausanne, another in Bern,
two in Zurich, twelve days at Donaueschingen; then brief stops at
Biberach, Ulm, and Augsburg; a longer stay at Munich, where Wolfgang
again took sick. At last, toward the end of November, 1766, after an
absence of three and a half years, the family regained Salzburg. The old
Archbishop forgave them, and they could now appreciate the comforts of
home. All seemed well, but Mozart was never quite healthy again.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Leopold was an unrelenting taskmaster. He put his son through a hard
course of instruction in counterpoint, thorough bass, and such other
elements of composition as had come down to him from German and Italian
music. When the Archbishop heard that Wolfgang composed, he wondered was
not the father co-operating. To settle the question he invited the boy
to stay with him for a week; he isolated him from all outside help, gave
him paper, pencil, and harpsichord, and bade him compose part of an
oratorio on the First Commandment. At the close of the week Mozart
presented the result; the Archbishop was told that it merited praise; he
commissioned his Konzert- meister , Michael (brother of Joseph) Haydn,
to compose a second part, and his organist to compose a third; the whole
was performed at the archiepis- copal court on March 12, 1767, and was
judged worthy of repetition on April 2. Mozart’s part is now included as
No. 35 in KochePs catalogue.*</p>

<p>he result that both Wolfgang and Marianna caught smallpox from the
bride. The unhappy parents took their prodigies to Olmiitz in Moravia,
where Count Podstatsky gave them shelter and care. Mozart was blind for
nine days. On January io, 1768, the family was back in Vienna; both the
Empress and Joseph II received them cordially, but the court was
mourning the death of the bride, and concerts were out of the
question.</p>
<p>After a long and unprofitable absence the family returned to Salzburg
(January 5, 1769). Mozart continued his studies with his father, but
toward the end of the year Leopold decided that he had taught the boy
all that he could, and that what Wolfgang needed now was acquaintance
with the musi- cal life of Italy. Having secured letters of introduction
to Italian maestri from Johann Hasse and others, father and son set out
on December 1 3, 1769, leaving Marianna and mother to keep a footing in
Salzburg. On the next eve- ning Mozart gave a concert at Innsbruck; he
played at sight an unfamiliar concerto placed before him as a test of
his skill; the local press acclaimed his “extraordinary musical
attainments.” 8 At Milan they met Sammartini, Hasse, and Piccini, and
Count von Firmian secured for Wolfgang a commission for an opera; this
meant a hundred ducats for the family coffers. At Bologna they heard the
still marvelous voice of Farinelli, who had returned from his triumphs
in Spain, and they arranged with Padre Martini that Wolfgang should
return to take the tests for the coveted diploma of the Accademia
Filarmonica. At Florence, at the court of the Grand Duke Leopold, Mozart
played the harpsichord to Nardini’s violin. Then father and son hurried
on to Rome for the Holy Week music.</p>
<p>They arrived on April 1 1, 1770, in a storm of thunder and lightning,
so that Leopold could report that they had been “received like grand
people with a discharge of artillery.” 9 They were just in time to go to
the Sistine Chapel and hear the “Miserere” of Gregorio Allegri, which
was sung there annually. Copies of this famous chorale, written for
four, five, or nine parts, were hard to get; Mozart listened to it twice
and wrote it out from memory. They stayed four weeks in Rome, giving
concerts in the homes of the civil or ecclesiastical nobility. On May 8
they undertook the journey to Naples; robbers made the road perilous;
the Mozarts traveled with four Augustinian monks to secure divine
protection or an emergency viaticum. Naples held them for a full month,
for the aristocracy, from Tanucci downward, invited them to soirees and
placed lordly equipages at their disposal. When Wolf- gang played at the
Conservatorio della Pieta the superstitious audience ascribed his
prowess to some magic in the ring he wore; they were amazed when, having
discarded the ring, he played as brilliantly as before.</p>
<p>After enjoying Rome again they crossed the Apennines to worship the
Virgin in her Santa Casa at Loretto; then they turned north to spend
three months at Bologna. Almost daily Mozart received instruction from
Padre Martini in the arcana of composition. Then he took the test for
admission to the Accademia Filarmonica: he was given a piece of
Gregorian plain chant, to which, while he was shut up alone in a room,
he was required to add three upper parts in stile osservato — strict
traditional style. He failed, but</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>he good padre corrected his work, and the revised form was accepted
by the jury “in view of the special circumstances”— presumably Mozart’s
youth.</p>
<p>On October 18 father and son were in Milan. There Wolfgang had his
first triumph as a composer, but after hard work and much tribulation.
The subject for his commissioned opera was Mitridate, re di Ponto; the
libretto was taken from Racine. The fourteen-year-old youth toiled so
hard in com- posing, playing, and rewriting that his fingers ached; his
enthusiasm became a fever, and his father had to restrict his hours of
work and cool his agitation with an occasional walk. Mozart felt that
this, his first opera seria, was a far more critical test than that
antiquarian trial at Bologna; his career as an oper- atic composer might
depend upon the outcome. Now, though not much in- clined to piety, he
begged his mother and sister to pray for the success of this venture,
“so that we may all live happily together again.” 10 At last, when he
was near exhaustion with rehearsals, the opera was presented to the
public (December 26, 1770); the composer conducted, and his triumph was
com- plete. Every important aria was received with wild applause, some
with cries of “Evviva il maestro! Evviva il maestrinoT The opera was
repeated twenty</p>
<p>Now they could go home with their heads high. On March 28, 1771, they
reached Salzburg. They had hardly arrived when they received a request
from Count von Firmian, in the name of the Empress, that Wolfgang write
a serenata or cantata, and come to Milan in October to conduct it as
part of the ceremonies that were to celebrate the marriage of Archduke
Ferdinand to the Princess of Modena. Archbishop Sigismund consented to
another ab- sence of Leopold from his duties; and on August 1 3 pater et
filius set out again for Italy. Arrived in Milan, they found that Hasse
was there, prepar- ing an opera for the same ceremonies; perhaps without
intending it so, the managers had arranged a battle of genius between
the most renowned living composer of Italian opera, who was in his
seventy-third year, and the fifteen- year-old lad who had barely tried
his operatic wings. Hasse’s Ruggiero was performed to great applause on
October 16. On the next day Mozart’s can - tata, Ascanio in Alba, was
sung under his baton, and “the applause was extraordinary.” “I am
sorry,” wrote Leopold to his wife, “that Wolfgang’s serenata should have
so entirely eclipsed Hasse’s opera.” 12 Hasse was gen - erous; he joined
in the praise of Mozart, and made a famous prophecy: “ Questo ragazzo ci
fara dimenticar tutti ” (This boy will throw us all into oblivion).
13</p>
<p>Father and son returned to Salzburg (December 1 1, 1771). Five days
later the good Sigismund died. His successor as archbishop, Hieronymus
von Paula, Count von Colloredo, was a man of intellectual culture, an
admirer of Rousseau and Voltaire, an enlightened despot eager to carry
out the reforms that Joseph II was preparing. But even more than Joseph
he was despotic as well as enlightened, demanding discipline and
obedience, and intolerant of opposition. For his ceremonial installation
on April 29, 1772, he asked noth-</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>ing less than an opera from Mozart. The now famous youth responded
hast- ily with II sogno di Scipione ( The Dream of Scipio ); it served
its turn and is forgotten. Colloredo forgave it, and appointed Wolfgang
concertmaster with a yearly salary of 150 florins. The youth busied
himself for some months with composing symphonies, quartets, and
religious music, but also he worked on an opera, Lucio Silla, which
Milan had ordered for 1773.</p>
<p>By November 4, 1772, Leopold and his moneymaker were again in the
Lombard capital, and soon Wolf was laboring to find compromises between
his musical ideas and the caprices and capacities of the singers. The
prima donna began by being imperious and hard to satisfy; the maestrino
was pa- tient with her; she ended by loving him, and declared herself
“enchanted by the incomparable way Mozart had served her.” 14 The
premiere (February 26, 1772) was not so certain a success as Mitridate
two years before; the tenor fell ill during rehearsals, and had to be
replaced by a singer with no stage experience; nevertheless the opera
bore nineteen repetitions. The music was difficult; the arias were
strung too high with passion; perhaps some strain of Germany’s Sturm und
Drang had made here an incongruous entry into Italian opera. 15 In
exchange, Mozart brought back with him the bel canto clarity of Italian
song, and his naturally happy spirit was further brightened by Italian
skies and plein-air life. He learned in Italy that opera buff a, as he
heard it in the works of Piccini and Paisiello, could be high art; he
studied the form, and in Figaro and Don Giovanni he perfected it. To his
alert mind and ears every experience was education.</p>
<p>March 13, 1773, saw pere et fils again in Salzburg. The new
Archbishop was not as tolerant of their long absences as Sigismund had
been. He saw no reason for rewarding Leopold with promotion, and treated
Wolfgang as merely one of his household retinue. He expected the Mozarts
to supply his choir and his orchestra with music prompt, new, and good;
and for two years they labored to satisfy him. But Leopold wondered how
he could support his family without additional tours, and Wolfgang,
accustomed to applause, could not adjust himself to being a musical
servant. Besides, he wanted to write operas, and Salzburg had too small
a stage, too small a choir, orchestra, and audience, to let the bright
fledgling flap his expanding wings.</p>
<p>The clouds broke for a while when Elector Maximilian Joseph of
Bavaria commissioned Mozart to write an opera buff a for the Munich
Carnival of 1775, and secured the Archbishop’s consent to a leave of
absence for the composer and his father. They left Salzburg on December
6, 1774. Wolf- gang suffered from the severe cold, which brought on a
toothache more severe than either music or philosophy could mitigate.
But the premiere of La finta giardiniera ( The Pretended Garden Girl),
January 13, 1775, led Christian Schubart, a prominent composer, to
predict: “If Mozart does not turn out to be a hothouse plant [too
rapidly developed by intensive domestic care], he will undoubtedly be
one of the greatest composers that ever lived.” 16 His head swirling
with success, Mozart returned to Salzburg to serve what he felt to be an
unworthy vassalage.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa’s youngest son, the Archduke Maximilian; Mozart took an
old libretto by Metastasio and composed II re pastor e ( The Shepherd
King). It was performed on April 23, 1775. The story is silly, the music
is excellent; excerpts from it still show up in the concert repertoire.
Meanwhile Mozart was pouring forth sonatas, symphonies, concertos,
serenades, Masses; and some of the compositions of these unhappy years —
e.g., the Piano Concerto in E Flat (K. 271) and the Serenade in B (K.
250) — are among his enduring masterpieces. The Archbishop, however,
told him that he knew nothing of the composer’s art, and should go to
study at the Naples Conservatory. 17</p>
<p>Unable to bear the situation longer, Leopold asked permission to take
his son on a tour; Colloredo refused, saying he would not have members
of his staff go on “begging expeditions.” When Leopold asked again the
Arch - bishop dismissed him and his son from their employment. Wolfgang
re- joiced, but his father was frightened at the prospect of being
flung, aged fifty-six, upon the indiscriminate world. The Archbishop
relented and re- instated him, but would not hear of any absence from
his work. Who now would go with Wolfgang upon the extensive foray that
had been planned? Mozart was twenty-one, just the age for sexual
adventure and marital im- prisonment; more than ever he needed guidance.
So it was decided that his mother should accompany him. Marianna, trying
to forget that she too had been a genius, remained to give her father
the most loving care. On Septem- ber 23, 1777, mother and son left
Salzburg to conquer Germany and France.</p>

<p>From Munich, on September 26, Mozart wrote to his father a paean of
liberation: “I am in my very best spirits, for my head has been as light
as a feather ever since I got away from all that humbug; and what is
more, I have become fatter.” 18 That letter must have crossed one from
Leopold, whose emotion may remind us again that the events of history
were written upon human flesh:</p>
<p>After you both had left, I walked up our steps very wearily, and
threw my- self down on a chair. When we said good-by I made great
efforts to retain my- self in order not to make our parting too painful,
and in the rush and flurry I forgot to give my son a father’s blessing.
I ran to the window and sent my blessing after you, but I did not see
you…. Nannerl wept bitterly…. She and I send greetings to Mamma, and we
kiss you and her millions of times. 19</p>
<p>Munich taught Wolfgang that he was no longer a prodigy, but just one
musician in a land where the supply of composers and performers was out-
running the demand. He had hoped to secure a good place in the Elector’s
musical retinue, but all places were filled. Mother and son passed on to
Augs - burg, where they wore themselves out with visiting, at Leopold’s
urging, the friends of Leopold’s youth; but the survivors were now m
ostly fat and stodgy, and Wolfgang found no interest in them except with
a merry cousin, Maria Anna Thekla Mozart, whom he was to immortalize
with obscenities.</p>
<p>39 ° ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XV</p>
<p>More to his purpose was Johann Andreas Stein, maker of pianofortes;
here for the first time Mozart, who had hitherto used the harpsichord,
began to appreciate the possibilities of the new instrument; by the time
he reached Paris he had made his transition to the piano. At a concert
in Augsburg he played both the piano and the violin, to great applause
but little profit.</p>
<p>On October 26 mother and son moved on to Mannheim. There Mozart en-
joyed the company and stimulus of skilled musicians, but the Elector
Karl Theodor could find no opening for him, and rewarded his performance
at court with only a gold watch. Mozart wrote to his father: “Ten
carolins would have suited me better…. What one needs on a journey is
money; and, let me tell you, I now have five watches…. I am seriously
thinking of having a watch pocket on each leg of my trousers; when I
visit some great lord I shall wear both watches,… so that it will not
occur to him to give me another.” 20 Leopold advised him to hurry on to
Paris, where Grimm and Mme. d’fipinay would help him; but Wolfgang
persuaded his mother that the trip would be too arduous for her in the
winter months. Assuming that they were soon leaving for Paris, Leopold
warned Wolfgang to beware of the women and the musicians there, and
reminded him that he was now the financial hope of the family. Leopold
had gone into debt for seven hundred gulden; he was taking pupils in his
old age,</p>
<p>and that, too, in a town where this heavy work is wretchedly paid….
Our future depends upon your abundant good sense…. I know that you love
me, not merely as your father, but also as your truest and surest
friend; and that you understand and realize that our happiness and
unhappiness, and, what is more, my long life or my speedy death, are,…
apart from God, in your hands. If I have read you aright, I have nothing
but joy to expect from you, and this alone must console me when I am
robbed by your absence of a father’s delight in hearing you, seeing you,
and folding you in my arms…. From my heart I give you my paternal
blessing. 21</p>
<p>To one of Leopold’s letters (February 9, 1778) “Nannerl,” now twenty
-six, dowerless and facing spinsterhood, added a note that rounds out
the picture of this loving family:</p>
<p>Papa never leaves me room enough to write to Mamma and yourself…. I
beg her not to forget me…. I wish you a pleasant journey to Paris, and
the best of health. I do hope, however, that I shall be able to embrace
you soon. God alone knows when that will happen. We are both longing for
you to make your fortune, for that, I know for certain, will mean
happiness for us all. I kiss Mamma’s hands and embrace you, and trust
that you will always remember us and think of us. But you must do so
only when you have time, say for a quarter of an hour when you are
neither composing nor teaching. 22</p>
<p>It was in this mood of great expectations and loving trust that
Leopold re- ceived a letter written by Wolfgang on February 4,
announcing the arrival of Cupid. Among the minor musicians at Mannheim
was Fridolin Weber, who was blessed and burdened with a wife, five
daughters, and a son. Frau Weber was casting nets to snare husbands,
especially for the oldest daughter, Josefa, nineteen and nervously
nubile. Mozart, however, fancied Aloysia, sixteen, whose angelic voice
and swelling charms made her a young musi-</p>

<p>cian’s dream. He hardly noticed Constanze, fourteen, who was to be
his wife. For Aloysia he composed some of his tenderest songs. When she
sang them he forgot his own ambitions, and thought of accompanying her —
and Josef a and their father — to Italy, where she could get vocal
instruction and operatic</p>
<p>I have become so fond of this unfortunate family that my dearest wish
is to make them happy…. My advice is that they should go to Italy. So
now I should like you to write to our good friend Lugiati, and the
sooner the better, and inquire what are the highest terms given to a
prima donna in Verona…. As far as Aloysia’s singing is concerned, I
would wager my life that she will bring me renown…. If our plan
succeeds, we — Herr Weber, his two daugh- ters, and I — will have the
honor of visiting my dear sister for a fortnight on our way through
Salzburg…. I will gladly write an opera for Verona for fifty zecchini
(50?), if only in order that she may make her name…. The eldest daughter
will be very useful to us, for we could have our own menage, as she can
cook. Apropos, you must not be too much surprised when you learn that I
have only forty-two gulden left out of seventy-seven. This is merely the
result of my delight at being again in the company of honest and
like-minded peo- ple….</p>
<p>Send me an answer soon. Do not forget how much I desire to write
operas. I envy anyone who is composing one. I could really weep for
vexation when I hear… an aria. But Italian, not German; seria, not buff
a!… I have now written all that is weighing on my heart. My mother is
quite satisfied with my ideas…. The thought of helping a poor family,
without injury to myself, de- lights my very soul. I kiss your hands a
thousand times and remain until death your most obedient son. 23</p>
<p>Leopold replied on February 1 1 :</p>
<p>My dear son! I have read your letter of the 4th with amazement and
horror…. For the whole night I have been unable to sleep…. Merciful
God!… Those happy moments are gone when, as a child or a boy, you never
went to bed without standing on a chair and singing to me,… and kissing
me again and again on the tip of my nose, and telling me that when I
grew old you would put me in a glass case and protect me from every
breath of air, so that you might always have me with you and honor me.
Listen to me, therefore, in pa- tience!…</p>
<p>He went on to say that he had hoped Wolfgang would defer marriage
until he had made a secure place for himself in the musical world; then
he would get a good wife, bring up a fine family, help his parents and
his sister. But now, infatuated with a young siren, this son forgets his
parents, and thinks only of following a girl to Italy, as part of her
entourage. What incredible nonsense!</p>
<p>Off with you to Paris! and that soon! Find your place among great
people. Aut Caesar aut nihil!… From Paris the name and fame of a man of
great talent resounds through the whole world. There the nobility treat
men of genius with the greatest deference, esteem, and courtesy; there
you will see a refined manner of life, which forms an astonishing
contrast to the coarseness of our German courtiers and their ladies; and
there you may become proficient in the French tongue. 24</p>

<p>Mozart answered humbly that he had not taken very seriously the plan
to escort the Webers to Italy. He said a tearful goodbye to the Webers,
and promised to see them on his way home. On March 14, 1778, he and his
mother set off in the public coach for Paris.</p>
<ol start="4" type="i">
<li>in Paris: 1778</li>
</ol>
<p>They arrived on March 23, just in time to be engulfed in the
apotheosis of Voltaire. They took simple lodgings, and Mozart ran about
seeking commis- sions. Grimm and Mme d’Lpinay bestirred themselves to
draw some atten - tion to the youth whom Paris had acclaimed as a
prodigy fourteen years before. Versailles offered him the post of court
organist at two thousand livres for six months’ service per year;
Leopold advised him to take it; Grimm opposed; Mozart refused it as too
poorly paid, and perhaps as uncongenial to his talent. Many homes were
opened to him if he would play the piano for a meal, but even to get to
those homes required an expensive cab ride through muddy streets. One
noble, the Due de Guines, looked promising; for him and his daughter
Mozart composed the glorious Concerto in C for flute and harp (K. 299),
and he gave the young lady lessons in composition at a good fee; but
soon she married, and the Duke paid only three louis d’or (5?) for a
concerto that should have laid Paris at Mozart’s feet. For the first
time in his life Mozart lost courage. “I am tolerably well,” he wrote to
his father on May 29, “but I often wonder whether life is worth living.”
His spirits re - vived when Le Gros, director of the Concerts
Spirituels, engaged him to write a symphony (K. 297). It was performed
on June 18 with success.</p>
<p>Then, on July 3, his mother died. She had begun by enjoying her
vacation from Salzburg and housewifery; soon she was longing to return
to her home and the daily tasks and contacts that had given substance
and significance to her life. The nine days’ trip to Paris in a jolting
coach and jarring company and drenching rain had broken her health; and
the failure of her son to find a berth in Paris had cast a gloom over
her usually buoyant spirit. Day after day she had sat solitary amid
strange surroundings and unintelligible words, while her son went to
pupils, concerts, operas… Now, seeing her fade quietly away, Mozart
spent the last weeks at her side, caring for her tenderly, and hardly
believing that she could die so soon.</p>
<p>Mme. d’fipinay offered him a room in her home with Grimm, a place at
her table, and the use of her piano. He did not quite harmonize with
Grimm so near; Grimm idolized Voltaire, Mozart despised him, and was
shocked at the assumption of his hosts and their friends that
Christianity was a myth useful in social control. Grimm wanted him to
accept small commissions as a road to larger ones, and to play gratis
for influential families; Mozart felt that such a procedure would sap
his strength, which he preferred to give to composing. Grimm thought him
indolent, and so informed Leopold, who agreed. 25 The situation was made
worse by Mo zart’s repeated borrowing from Grimm, to a total of fifteen
louis dor (75?). Grimm told him that repayment could be indefinitely
postponed; it was. 28</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>393</p>
<p>The situation was resolved by a letter (August 31, 1778) from Mozart
pere that Archbishop Colloredo had offered to make the father
Kapellmeister if Wolfgang would serve as organist and concertmaster,
each to receive five hundred florins per year; moreov er, “the
Archbishop has declared himself prepared to let you travel where you
will if you want to write an opera.” As irresistible bait Leopold added
that Aloysia Weber would probably be in- vited to join the Salzburg
choir, in which case “she must stay with us.” 27 Mozart replied
(September n): “When I read your letter I trembled with joy, for I felt
myself already in your embrace. It is true, as you will acknowl- edge,
that it is not much of a prospect for me; but when I look forward to
seeing you, and embracing my very dear sister, I think of no other
prospect.” On September 26 he took the coach to Nancy. At Strasbourg he
earned a few louis d’or with arduous concerts to almost empty houses. He
dallied at Mannheim, hoping to be appointed conductor of German opera;
this too failed. He went on to Munich, dreaming of Aloysia Weber. But
she had found a place in the Elector’s choir, perhaps in his heart; she
received Mozart with a calm that showed no desire to be his bride. He
composed and sang a bitter song, and resigned himself to Salzburg.</p>
<p>V. SALZBURG AND VIENNA: 1 779-82</p>
<p>He reached home in mid- January, and was welcomed with festivities
sad- dened by the now keenly realized death of the mother. Soon he was
in har- ness as organist and concertmaster, and soon he was fretting. He
later re- called:</p>
<p>In Salzburg work was a burden to me, and I could hardly ever settle
down to it. Why? Because I was never happy…. In Salzburg — for me at
least — there is not a farthing’s worth of entertain ment. I refuse to
associate with a good many people there — and most of the others do not
think me good enough. Be- sides, there is no stimulus for my talent.
When I play, or when any of my com- positions is performed, it is just
as if the audience were all tables and chairs. If only there were even a
tolerably good theater in Salzburg ! 28</p>
<p>He longed to write operas, and gladly accepted the request of Elector
Karl Theodor to compose one for the next Munich festival. He began work
on Idomeneo , re di Crete , in October, 1780; in November he went to
Munich for rehearsals; on January 29, 1781, the opera was produced with
success, despite its unusual length. Mozart remained six weeks more in
Adunich, relish- ing its social life, until a summons came from
Archbishop Colloredo to join him in Vienna. There he had the pleasure of
living in the same palace with his employer, but he ate with the
servants. “The two valets sit at the head of the table, and I have the
honor to be placed above the cooks.” 29 T his was the custom of the time
in the homes of the nobility; Haydn bore it with silent resentment,
Adozart rebelled against it ever more audibly. He was pleased to have
his music and his talent displayed in the homes of the Archbishop’s
friends, but he fumed when Colloredo refused most of his requests to let
him</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>accept outside engagements that might have brought him added income
and wider fame. “When I think of leaving Vienna without at least a
thousand florins in my pocket, my heart sinks within me.” 30</p>
<p>He made up his mind to quit Colloredo’s service. On May 2, 1781, he
went to live as a lodger with the Webers, who had moved to Vienna. When
the Archbishop sent him instructions to return to Salzburg, he replied
that he could not leave till May 12. An interview followed, in which the
Arch- bishop (as Mozart reported to his father)</p>
<p>called me the most opprobrious names — oh, I really cannot bring
myself to write you all! At last, when my blood was boiling, I could
hold out no longer, and said, “Then your Serene Highness is not
satisfied with me?” “What! do you mean to threaten me, you rascal, you
villain? There is the door; I will have nothing more to do with such a
wretched fellow!” At last I said, “Neither will I with you.” “Then be
off!” As I went I said, “Let it be so, then; tomorrow you shall hear
from me by letter.” Tell me, dear father, should I not have had to say
this sooner or later?…</p>
<p>Write to me privately that you are pleased — for indeed you may be so
— and find fault with me heartily in public, so that no blame may attach
to you. But if the Archbishop offers you the least impertinence, come to
me at once in Vienna. We can all three live on my earnings. 31</p>
<p>Leopold was plunged into another crisis. His own position seemed im-
periled, and it was not for some time yet that he would receive
reassurances from Colloredo. He was alarmed at the news that his son was
rooming with the Webers. The father of that family was now dead; Aloysia
had married the actor Joseph Lange; but the widow had another daughter,
Constanze, waiting for a husband. Was this another blind alley for
Wolfgang? Leopold begged him to apologize to the Archbishop, and come
home. Mozart now for the first time refused to obey his father. “To
please you, my dear father, I would renounce my happiness, my health,
and life itself, but my honor comes before all with me, and so it must
be with you. My dearest, best of fathers, demand of me what you will,
only not that.” 32 On June 2 he sent Leopold thirty ducats as an earnest
of future aid.</p>
<p>Three times he went to the Archbishop’s Vienna residence to submit
his formal resignation. Colloredo’s chamber lain refused to transmit it,
and on the third occasion he “threw him [Mozart] out of the antechamber
and gave him a kick in the behind”— so Mozart described the scene in his
letter of June 9. 33 To appease his father he left the Weber home and
took other lodg- ings. He assured Leopold that he had only “had fun”
with Constanze: “if I had to marry all those with whom I have jested, I
should have two hundred wives at least.” 34 However, on December 15 he
informed his father that Con- stanze was so sweet, so simple and
domestic, that he wished to marry her.</p>
<p>You are horrified at the idea? But I entreat you, dearest, most
beloved father, to listen to me…. The voice of nature speaks as loud in
me as in others — louder, perhaps, than in many a big, strong lout of a
fellow. I simply cannot live as most young men do in these days. In the
first place, I have too much religion; in the second place I have too
much love of my neighbor and too high a feel- ing of honor to seduce an
innocent girl; and in the third place I have too much</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>horror and disgust, too much dread and fear of diseases, and too much
care for my health, to fool about with whores. So I can swear that I
have never had relations of that sort with any woman…. I stake my life
on the truth of what I have told you….</p>
<p>But who is the object of my love?… Surely not one of the Webers?
Yes,… Constanze,… the kindest-hearted, the cleverest, the best of them
all…. Tell me whether I could wish myself a better wife…. All that I
desire is to have a small assured income (of which, thank God, I have
good hopes), and then I shall never cease entreating you to allow me to
save this poor girl and to make myself and her — and, if I may say so,
all of us — very happy. For surely you are happy when I am? And you are
to enjoy one half of my -fixed income…. Please take pity on your son !
35</p>
<p>Leopold did not know what to believe. He used every effort to
dissuade his almost penniless son from marriage, but Mozart felt that
after twenty-six years of filial obedience it was time for him to have
his own way, to lead his own life. Through seven months he pleaded in
vain for parental consent; finally, on August 4, 1782, he married
without it. On August 5 it came. Now Mozart was free to discover how far
one could support a family by compos- ing the most varied assemblage of
superb mu sic in man’s history.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE COMPOSER</li>
</ol>
<p>He had reason for confidence, for he had already won reputation as a
pianist, had acquired some paying pupils, and had produced successful
operas. Just a month after leaving the Archbishop’s service he received
from Count Orsini-Rosenberg, director of court theaters for Joseph II, a
commission to compose a Singspiel — a spoken drama interspersed with
songs. The result was presented on July 16, 1782, in the presence of the
Emperor, as Die Entfuh- rung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction front the
Seraglio). A hostile clique condemned it, but nearly all the audience
was won over by the vivacious arias that adorned an aged theme: a
Christian beauty captured by pirates, sold to a Turkish harem, and
rescued by her Christian lover after incredible intrigues. Joseph II
commented on the music, “Too beautiful for our ears, my dear Mozart, and
far too many notes”; to which the reckless composer answered, “Exactly
as many, your Majesty, as are needed.” 36 Th e operetta was repeated
thirty-three times in Vienna in its first six years. Gluck praised it,
though he perceived that it quite ignored his “reform” of the opera; he
admired the instrumental compositions of the impetuous youth, and
invited him to dinner.</p>
<p>Mozart took inspiration rather from Italy than from Germany; he pre-
ferred melody and simple harmony to complex and erudite polyphony. Only
in his final decade did he feel strong influences from Handel and Johann
Sebastian Bach. In 1782 he joined the musicians who, under the aegis of
Baron Gottfried van Swieten, gave concerts, chiefly of Handel and Bach,
in the National Library or in van Swieten’s home. In 1774 the Baron had
brought from Berlin to Vienna The Art of the fugue , The W ell-tempered
Clavichord , and other works of J. S. Bach. He deprecated Italian music
as</p>
<p>396</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>( CHAP. XV</p>
<p>amateurish; real music, he thought, required strict attention to
fugue, po- lyphony, and counterpoint. Mozart, though he never allowed
structure, rule, or form to be an end in itself, profited from van
Swieten’s counsel and con - certs, and carefully studied Handel and the
major Bachs. After 1787 he conducted Handel concerts in Vienna, and took
some liberties in adjusting Handel’s scores to Viennese orchestras. In
his later instrumental music he wedded Italian melody and German
polyphony in a harmonious union.</p>
<p>A glance at Kochel’s catalogue of Mozart’s compositions is an impr
essive experience. Here are listed 626 works — the largest body of music
left by any composer except Haydn, all produced in a life of thirty-six
years, and in- cluding masterpieces in every form: 77 sonatas, 8 trios,
29 quartets, 5 quin- tets, 51 concertos, 96 divertimenti, dances or
serenades, 52 symphonies, 90 arias or songs, 60 religious compositions,
22 operas. If some of those near Mozart thought him indolent, it may
have been because they did not quite realize that the labor of the
spirit can exhaust the flesh, and that without in- tervals of lethargy
genius would slip into insanity. His father told him, “Pro -
crastination is your besetting sin,” 37 and in many cases Mozart waited
till almost the last hour before putting to paper the music that had
been taking form in his head. “I am, so to speak, steeped in music,” he
said; “it is in my mind the whole day, and I love to dream, to study, to
reflect on it.” 38 His wife reported, “He was always strumming upon
something— his hat, his watch fob , the table, the chair, as if they
were the keyboard.” 39 Sometimes he carried on this silent composition
even while apparently listening to an opera. He kept scraps of music
paper in his pockets, or, when traveling, in the side pocket of the
carriage; on these he made fragmentary notes; usually he carried a
leather case to receive such obiter scripta. When he was ready to
compose he sat not at a keyboard but at a table; he “wrote music like
let - ters,” said Constanze, “and never tried a movement until it was
finished.” Or he would sit at the piano for hours on end, improvising,
leaving his musical fancy seemingly free, but half unconsciously
subjecting it to some recog- nizable structure — sonata form, aria,
fugue… Musicians enjoyed Mozart’s improvisations because they could
detect, with esoteric delight, the order hidden behind the apparently
whimsical strains. Niemetschek said in old age, “If I dared to pray for
one more earthly joy it would be that I might hear Mozart improvise.”
40</p>
<p>Mozart could play almost any music at sight, because he had seen
certain combinations and sequences of notes so often that he could read
them as one note, and his habituated fingers played them as one musical
phrase or idea, just as a practiced reader takes in a line as if it were
a word, or a paragraph as if it were a line. Mozart’s trained memory was
allied with this capacity to perceive aggregates, to feel the logic that
compelled the part to indicate the whole. In later years he could play
almost any one of his concertos by heart. At Prague he wrote the drum
and trumpet parts of the second finale in Don Giovanni without having at
hand the score for the other instruments; he had kept that complex music
in his memory. Once he wrote down only the violin part of a sonata for
piano and violin; the next day, without a rehearsal, Re-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>gina Strinasacchi played the violin part at a concert, and Mozart
played the piano part purely from the memory of his conception, without
having had time to set it down upon paper. 41 Probably no other man in
history was ever so absorbed in music.</p>
<p>We think of Mozart’s sonatas as rather slight and playful, hardly in
a class wit h Beethoven’s passionate and powerful pronouncements in the
same genre; this may be because they were written for pupils of limited
legerdemain, or for harpsichords of minor resonance, or for a piano that
had no means of con- tinuing a note. 42 The favorite of our childhood,
the Sonata in A (K. 331), with its engaging “Minuetto” and its “Rondo
alia Turca,” is still (1778) in harpsichord style.</p>
<p>Mozart did not at first care for chamber music, but in 1773 he came
upon Haydn’s early quartets, envied the ir contrapuntal excellence, and
imitated them with something short of success in the six quartets that
he composed in that year. In 1781 Haydn published another series; Mozart
was again stirred to rivalry, and issued (1782-85) six quartets (K. 387,
421, 428, 458, 464-65) that are now universally recognized as among the
supreme examples of their kind. Performers complained that they were
abominably difficult; critics es- pecially condemned the sixth for its
clashing dissonances and its turbulent mixture of major and minor keys.
An Italian musician returned the score to the publisher as obviously
full of gross mistakes, and one purchaser, when he found that the
discords were deliberate, tore up the sheets in a rage. Yet it was after
playing the fourth, fifth, and sixth of these quartets with Mozart,
Dittersdorf, and others that Haydn said to Leopold Mozart, “Before God,
and as an honest man, I tell you that your son is the greatest composer
known to me either in person or by name. He has taste, and, what is
more, the most profound knowledge of composition.” 43 When the six
quartets were pub - lished (1785) Mozart dedicated them to Haydn with a
letter that shines out even in a brilliant correspondence:</p>
<p>A father who had decided to send his sons out into the great world
thought it his duty to entrust them to the protection and guidance of a
man who was very celebrated at the time, and who, moreover, happened to
be his best friend. In like manner I send my six sons to you, most
celebrated and very dear friend. They are indeed the fruit of a long and
laborious study; but the hope which many friends have given me that
their toil will be in some degree rewarded,… flatters me with the
thought that these children may one day prove a source of consolation to
me.</p>
<p>During your last stay in this capital you… expressed to me your
approval of these compositions. Your good opinion encourages me to offer
them to you, and leads me to hope that you will not consider them
unworthy of your favor. Please then receive them kindly, and be to them
a father, guide, and friend. From this moment I surrender to you all my
rights over them. I entreat you, however, to be indulgent to those
faults which may have escaped their com- poser’s partial eye, and, in
spite of them, to continue your generous friendship towards one who so
highly appreciates it. 44</p>
<p>Mozart had a particular fondness for his quintets. He thought his
Quintet in E Flat for piano, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon (K. 452)
“the best</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>work I have ever composed,” 45 but that was before he had written his
major operas. “Eine kleine Nachtmusik” was originally (1787) composed as
a quin- tet, but it was soon taken up by small orchestras, and is now
classed among Mozart’s serenades. He valued, as “rather carefully”
written, the Serenade in E Flat (K. 375), with which he himself was
serenaded one evening in 1781, but musicians rank above it the Serenade
in C Minor (K. 388) — which is as somber as the Pathetiques of Beethoven
and Tchaikowsky.</p>
<p>Having discovered the orchestra, Mozart turned it to a hundred
experi- ments: overtures, nocturnes, suites, cassations (variants of the
suite), dances, divertimenti. The last were usually intended to serve a
passing purpose rather than to echo in the halls of history; they are
not to be weighed but enjoyed. Even so, Divertimenti No. 15 (K. 287) and
No. 17 (K. 334) are substantial works, more delightful than most of the
symphonies.</p>
<p>For his symphonies Mozart, like Haydn, used a “band” of thirty
-five</p>
<p>pieces; hence they fail to convey their full worth to ears accustomed
to the multiplied sonority of twentieth-century orchestras. Pundits
praise No. 25 (K. 183) as “impassioned” 46 and “a miracle of impetuous
expression,” 47 but the earliest Mozart symphony of note is the Paris
(No. 31, K. 297), which Mozart adapted to the French taste for
refinement and charm. The Haffner Symphony (No. 35, K. 385) was
originally composed in haste to grace the festivities planned by
Sigismund Haffner, former burgomaster of Salzburg, for the wedding of
his daughter (1782); Mozart later added parts for flute and clarinet,
and presented it at Vienna (March 3, 1783) at a concert at- tended by
Joseph II. The Emperor “gave me great applause,” and twenty - five
ducats. 48 In this and No. 36, written at Linz in November, 1783, Mozart
still kept to the form and stamp — always pleasant, seldom profound —
that Haydn had laid upon the symphony; in both cases the slow movement
comes most gratefully to aging ears. We must speak more respectfully of
No. 38, which Mozart composed for Prague in 1786; here the first
movement pleases the musician with its structural logic and contrapuntal
skill, and the andante, adding contemplation to melody, has stirred
experts to speak of its “undying perfection” 49 and its “enchanted
world.” 50</p>
<p>By c ommon consent the greatest of Mozart’s symphonies are the three
that he poured forth in a torrent of inspiration in the summer of 1788 —
at a time of depressing poverty and mounting debts. The first is dated
June 26, the second July 25, the third August 10 — three births in three
months. So far as we know, none of them was ever played in his lifetime;
he never heard them; they remained in that mysterious realm in which
black spots on a sheet were for the composer “ditties of no sound”—
notes and harmonies heard only by the mind. The third, misnamed the
Jupiter (No. 41 in C, K. 551), is usually accounted the best; Schumann
equated it with Shakespeare and Beethoven, 51 but it does not lend
itself to amateur appreciation. No. 40 in G Minor (K. 550) begins with a
vigor that presages the Eroica, and it pro- ceeds to a development that
has led commentators — struggling in vain to ex- press music in words —
to read into it a Lear or Macbeth of personal tragedy; 52 yet to simpler
ears it seems almost naively joyous. To the same ears the most</p>

<p>MOZART</p>
<p>399</p>
<p>satisfying of the symphonies is No. 39 in E Flat (K. 543). It is not
burdened with woe, nor is it tortured with technique; it is melody and
harmony flow- ing in a placid stream; it is such music as might please
the gods on a rural holiday from celestial chores.</p>
<p>The sinfonia concertante is a cross between the symphony and the con-
certo; it grew out of the concerto grosso by opposing two or more
instru- ments to the orchestra in a dialogue between melody and
accompaniment. Mozart raised the form to its apex in the Sinfonia
Concertante in E Flat (K.</p>
<ol start="364" type="1">
<li>for flute, violin, and viola (1779); this is as fine as any of his
sym- phonies.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the concertos are delightful, for in them the solo passages help
the un- trained ear to follow themes and strains that in the symphonies
may be ob- scured by technical elaboration or contrapuntal play. Debate
is interesting, and all the more so when, as in the form of the concerto
as proposed by Karl Philipp Emanuel Bach and developed by Mozart, the
contest is of one against all — solo contra tutti. Since Mozart relished
such harmonious con- frontations, he wrote most of his concertos for the
piano, for in these he played the solo part himself, usually adding,
toward the end of the first move- ment, a cadenza that allowed him to
frolic and shine as a virtuoso.</p>
<p>He first touched excellence in this form with Piano Concerto No. 9 in
E Flat (K. 271). The earliest of his still popular concertos is No. 20
in D Minor (K. 466), famous for its almost childlike “Romanze”; in this
slow movement, we might say, the Romantic movement in music began.
Whether through laziness or distractions, Mozart did not complete the
score of this concerto till an hour before the time appointed for its
performance (Febru- ary 11, 1785); copies reached the players just
before the recital, allowing no time for practice or rehearsal; yet the
performance went so well, and Mozart played his part so expertly, that
many repetitions were called for in the en- suing years.</p>
<p>Mozart offered noble music for other solo instruments. Perhaps the
melo- dious Concerto in A for clarinet (K. 622) comes over the air more
frequently than any other of his compositions. In his merry youth (1774)
he had great fun with a Concerto in B Flat for the bassoon. The horn
concertos were bubbles gaily blown upon the score — which sometimes bore
humorous direc- tions for the performer: u da bravo /,’’ “coraggio!”
“bestial,” “ohime!”— for Mozart was familiar with more wind instruments
than one. Then the Con- certo for Flute and Harp (K. 299) lifts us to
the stars.</p>
<p>In 1775 Mozart, aged nineteen, composed five violin concertos, all of
them beautiful, three of them still in living repertoires. No. 3 in G
(K. 216) has an adagio that sent an Einstein into ecstasy, 53 No. 4 in D
is one of mus ic’s masterpieces, and No. 5 in A has an andante cantabile
that rivals the miracle of a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>Little wonder that Mozart produced, especially in the years of his
love for Aloysia Weber, some of the most delectable airs in all the
literature of song. They are not full-blown lieder, such as found their
ripe development in Schubert and Brahms; they are simpler and shorter,
often adorning •silly</p>
<p>400 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>words; but when Mozart found a real poem, like Goethe’s “Das
Veilchen,” he rose to the peak of the form (K. 476). A violet, trembling
with joy at the approach of a pretty shepherdess, thinks how sweet it
would be to lie upon her breast; but as she walks along, gaily singing,
she crushes it unseen under her foot. 54 Was this a memory of the cruel
Aloysia? For her Mozart had written one of his tenderest arias — “Non so
d’onde viene.” But he attached little importance to such isolated songs;
he kept the secret resources of his vocal art for the arias in his
operas and his compositions for the Church.</p>
<p>His religious music was rarely heard outside Salzburg, for the
Catholic Church frowned upon the operatic qualities apparently expected
by the archbishops whom Mozart served. High Mass in Salzburg was sung to
an accompaniment of organ, strings, trumpets, trombones, and drums, and
pas- sages of merriment broke out in the most solemn places in Mozart’s
Masses. Yet the religious spirit must surely be moved by the motets
“Adoramus Te” ( K. 327) and “Santa Maria Mater Dei” (K. 341b); and the
most hauntingly beautiful strain in all of Mozart appears in the
“Laudate Dominum” in the fourth of the “Vesperae solennes di confessore”
(K. 3 39). 55</p>
<p>All in all, Mozart’s music is the voice of a n aristocratic age that
had not heard the Bastille fall, and of a Catholic culture undisturbed
in its faith, free to enjoy the charms of life without the restless
search to find new content for an emptied dream. In its lighter aspects
this music harmonizes with the elegance of rococo ornament, with the
pictorial romances of Watteau, the calmly floating Olympus of Tiepolo,
the smiles and robes and pottery of Mme. de Pompadour. It is, by and
large, serene music, touched now and then by suffering and anger, but
raising neither a humble prayer nor a Pro- methean challenge to the
gods. Mozart began his work in childhood, and a childlike quality lurked
in his compositions until it dawned upon him that the Requiem which he
was writing for a stranger was his own.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>SPIRIT AND FLESH</li>
</ol>
<p>Mozart was not physically attractive. He was short, his head was too
large for his body, his nose was too large for his face, his upper lip
overlapped the lower, his bushy brows darkened his restless eyes; only
his abounding blond hair impressed. In later years he sought to offset
the shortcomings of his stature and features by splendid dress: shirt of
lace, blue coat with tails, gold buttons, knee breeches, and silver
buckles on his shoes. 56 Only when he performed at the piano was his
physique forgotten; then his eyes burned with intense concentration, and
every muscle of his body subordinated itself to the play of his mind and
hands.</p>
<p>As a boy he was modest, good-natured, trustful, loving; but his early
fame, and an almost daily diet of applause, developed some faults in his
character. “My son,” Leopold warned him (1778), “you are hot -tempered
and impul- sive,… much too ready to retort in a bantering tone to the
first chal-</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>4OI</p>
<p>lenge.” 57 Mozart admitted this and more. “If anyone offends me,” he
wrote, “I must revenge myself; unless I revenge myself with interest, I
consider I have only repaid my enemy and not corrected him.” 58 And he
yielded to no one in appreciating his genius. “Prince Kaunitz told the
Archduke that peo - ple like myself come into the world only once in a
hundred years.” 59</p>
<p>A sense of humor prevailed in his letters, and appeared in his music,
till his dying year. Usually it was harmlessly playful; sometimes it
became sharp satire; occasionally, in youth, it ran to obscenity. He
passed through a stage of fascination with defecation. When he was
twenty-one he wrote to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart nineteen
letters of incredible vulgarity. 60 A letter to his mother celebrated
flatulence in prose and verse. 61 She was not squeamish, for in a letter
to her husband she counseled him, “Keep well, my love; into your mouth
your arse you’ll shove.” 62 Apparently such funda - mental phrases were
standard procedure in the Mozart family and their cir- cle; they were
probably an heirloom from a lustier generation. They did not prevent
Mozart from writing to his parents and his sister letters of the tender-
est affection.</p>
<p>He was, on his own word, a virgin bridegroom. Was he a faithful hus-
band? His wife accused him of “servant gallantries.” 63 According to his
de - voted biographer:</p>
<p>Rumor was busy among the public and in the press, and magnified
solitary instances of weakness on his part into distinguishing features
of his character. He was credited with intrigues with every pupil he
had, and with every singer for whom he wrote a song; it was considered
witty to designate him as the nat- ural prototype of Don Juan. 64</p>
<p>The frequent confinements of his wife, her repeated trips to health
resorts, his own absence from her on concert tours, his sensitivity to
all the charms of women, his association with bewitching singers and
uninhibited actresses, created a situation in which some adventure was
well-nigh inevitable. Con- stanze related how he had confessed such an
“indiscretion” to her, and why she forgave him — “he was so good it was
impossible to be angry with him”; but her sister reports violent
outbreaks now and then. 65 Mozart seems to have been very fond of his
wife; he bore patiently her deficiencies as a house- wife, and wrote to
her, during their separations, letters of almost childish endearment.
66</p>
<p>He was not a success socially. He judged some rivals harshly,
“dementi’s sonatas are worthless…. He is a charlatan, like all
Italians.” 67 “Yesterday</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>He suffered another handicap in having never gone to school or
univer- sity. His father had allowed him no time for general education.
Mozart had among his few books some volumes of poetry by Gessner,
Wieland, and Gellert, but he seems to have used them chiefly as a source
of possible libret- tos. He cared little for art or literature. He was
in Paris when Voltaire died; he could not understand why the city had
made such a fuss over the old rebel’s visit and death. “That godless
rascal Voltaire,” he wrote to his father, “has pegged out like a dog,
like a beast! That is his reward.” 70 He imbibed some anticlericalism
from his Masonic confreres, but he took part, candle in hand, in a
Corpus Christi procession. 71</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the simplicity of his mind that made him lovable
despite his faults. Those who were not his rivals in music found him
sociable, cheer- ful, kind, and usually serene. “All my life,” his
sister -in-law Sophie Weber wrote, “I have never seen Mozart in a
temper, still less angry”; 72 but there</p>
<p>vm. apogee: 1782-87</p>
<p>He began his free-lance career in Vienna with heartening success. He
was well paid for the lessons he gave; each of his concerts in 1782-84
brought him some five hundred gulden. 74 Only seventy of his
compositions were published in his lifetime, but he was reasonably paid.
The publisher Artarin gave him a hundred ducats for the six quartets
dedicated to Haydn — a hand- some sum for those days. 75 Another
publisher, Hoffmeister, lost money by printing Mozart’s piano quartets
in G Minor (K. 478) and E Flat (K. 493); the musicians found them too
difficult (they are now considered easy), and Hoffmeister warned Mozart,
“Write more popularly, or else I can neither</p>
<p>CHAP. XV ) MOZART 403</p>
<p>But Mozart did not put those gulden in the bank. He spent them on
cur- rent expenses, entertainment, good clothes, and in meeting the
needs of mendicant friends. For these and more obscure reasons he fell
into debt at the height of the demand for his services and his
compositions. As early as February 15, 1783, he wrote to the Baroness
von Waldstadten that one of his creditors had threatened to “bring an
action against me…. At the moment I cannot pay — not even half the sum!…
I entreat your Lady- ship, for Heaven’s sake, to help me keep my honor
and my good name.” 79 He was temporarily relieved by the success of a
concert given for his benefit in March, which brought in sixteen hundred
gulden. Out of this he sent a gift to his father.</p>
<p>In May, 1783, he moved to a good house at No. 244 in the Judenplatz.
There his first child was born (June 17) — “a fine, sturdy boy, as round
as a ball.” This event, and the gift, softened paternal resentment of
the marriage; Wolfgang and Constanze took advantage of the thaw to visit
Leopold and Nannerl in Salzburg, leaving the infant in Vienna with a
nurse. On August 1 9 the child died. Its parents remained in Salzburg,
for Mozart had arranged for the performance there of his Mass in C
Minor, in which Constanze was to sing. Wolfgang and Constanze outstayed
their welcome, for Leopold had to count every penny, and thought three
months were too long a visit. On their way back to Vienna they stopped
at Linz, where Count von Thun commissioned Mozart to write a
symphony.</p>
<p>Home again, he worked hard, teaching composing, performing, conduct-
ing. In two months (February 26 to April 3, 1784) he gave three concerts
and played in nineteen others. 80 In December he joined one of the seven
Freemason lodges in Vienna; he enjoyed their meetings, and readily con-
sented to write music for their festivals. In February his father,
mollified by the birth of another son to Constanze, came for a long
visit. And in 1785 Lorenzo da Ponte entered Mozart’s life.</p>
<p>This Lorenzo had almost as adventurous a life as his friend Casanova.
He had begun life in 1 749 as the son of a tanner in the ghetto of
Ceneda. When he was fourteen Emmanuele Conegliano and two brothers were
taken by their father to Lorenzo da Ponte, bishop of Ceneda, to be
baptized into the Catholic Church. Emmanuele adopted the bishop’s name,
became a priest, had an affair at Venice with a married woman, was
banished, moved to Dresden, then to Vienna, and was engaged in 1783 as
poet and librettist to the National Theater.</p>
<p>Mozart suggested to him the possibility of making an opera libretto
out of Beaumarchais’ recent comedy Le Manage de Figaro. This had been
trans - lated into German with a view to staging it in Vienna, but
Joseph II forbade it as containing revolutionary sentiments that would
scandalize his court. Could the Emperor, who was himself quite a
revolutionary, be persuaded to allow an opera judiciously abstracted
from the play? Ponte admired Mozart’s music; he was to speak of him
later as one who, “although endowed with talents surpassing those of any
composer, past, present, or future, had.not been able as yet, owing to
the intrigues of his enemies, to utilize his divine</p>
<p>404 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XV</p>
<p>genius in Vienna.” 81 He eliminated the radical overtones of
Beaumarchais’ drama, and transformed the remainder into an Italian
libretto rivaling the best of Metastasio.</p>
<p>The story of Le nozze di Figaro was the old maze of disguises,
surprises, and recognitions, and the clever hoodwinking of masters by
servants: all familiar in comedy since Menander and Plautus. Mozart took
readily to the theme, and composed the music almost as fast as the
libretto took form; both were completed in six weeks. On April 29, 1786,
Mozart wrote the overture; on May 1 the premiere went off triumphantly.
Part of the success may have been due to the jovial, stentorian basso,
Francesco Benucci, who sang the part of Figaro; more must have been due
to the vivacity and fitness of the music, and to such arias as
Cherubino’s plaintive “Voi che sapete” and the Countess’ intense yet
restrained appeal to the god of love in “Porgi amor.” So many encores
were demanded that the performance took twice the usual time; and at the
end Mozart was repeatedly called to the stage.</p>
<p>The income from the production of Figaro in Vienna and Prague should
have kept Mozart solvent for a year had it not been for his
extravagance, and the illnesses and pregnancies of his wife. In April,
1787, they moved to a less expensive house, Landstrasse 224. A month
later Leopold died, leaving his son a thousand gulden.</p>
<p>Prague commissioned another opera. Ponte suggested for a subject the
sexual escapades of Don Juan. Tirso de Molina had put the legendary Don
on the stage at Madrid in 1630 as El burlador de Sevilla ( The Deceiver
of Seville)-, Moliere had told the story in Paris as Le Festin de pierre
( The Feast of Stone, 1665); Goldoni had presented it in Venice as Don
Giovanni T enorio (1736); Vincente Righini had staged II convitato di
pietra in Vienna in 1777; and at Venice, in this very year 1787,
Giuseppe Gazzaniga had pro- duced, under the same title, an opera from
which Ponte stole many lines, including the jaunty catalogue of
Giovanni’s sins.</p>
<p>The “greatest of all operas” (as Rossini called it) had its premiere
at</p>
<p>Prague on October 29, 1787. Mozart and Constanze went up to the
Bohemian capital for the event; they were feted so fully that he
deferred the composi- tion of the overture till the eve of the premiere;
then, at midnight, “after spending the merriest evening imaginable,” 82
he composed a piece which is almost Wagnerian in foreshadowing the
tragic and comic elements of the play. The score reached the orchestra
just in time for the performance. 83 The Vienna Zeitung reported: “On
Monday Kapellmeister Mozart’s long -ex- pected opera, Don Giovanni, was
performed… Musicians and connois- seurs are agreed that such a
performance has never before been witnessed in Prague. Herr Mozart
himself conducted, and his appearance in the orchestra was the signal
for cheers, which were renewed at his exit.” 84</p>
<p>On November 12 the happy couple were back in Vienna. Gluck died three
days later, and Joseph II appointed Mozart to succeed him as Kammer-
musikus — chamber musician — to the court. After much trouble with the
singers Don Giovanni was produced in Vienna on May 7, 1788, to scanty
applause. Mozart and Ponte made further alterations, but the opera never
attained in Vienna the success it had in Prague, Mannheim, Hamburg…</p>

<p>MOZART</p>
<p>405</p>
<p>A Berlin critic complained that the drarnma giocoso was an offense
against morals, but he added: “If ever a nation might be proud of one of
its children, Germany may be proud of Mozart, the composer of this
opera.” 85 Nine years later Goethe wrote to Sc hiller: “Your hopes for
opera are richly fulfilled in Don Giovanni”; 86 and he mourned that
Mozart had not lived to write the music for Faust.</p>
<ol start="9" type="i">
<li>nadir: 1788-90</li>
</ol>
<p>The proceeds from Don Giovanni were soon used up, and Mozart’s modest
salary hardly paid for food. He took some pupils, but teaching was an
exhausting, time-consuming task. He moved to cheaper quarters in
suburban Wahringerstrasse; debts multiplied nevertheless. He borrowed
wherever he could — chiefly from a kindly merchant and fellow Mason,
Michael Puch- berg. To him Mozart wrote in June, 1788:</p>
<p>I still owe you eight ducats. Apart from the fact that at the moment
I am not in a position to pay you back this sum, my confidence in you is
so boundless that I dare implore you to help me out with a hundred
gulden until next week, when my concerts in the Casino are to begin. By
that time I shall certainly have received my subscription money, and
shall then be able quite easily to pay you back 136 gulden with my
warmest thanks. 87</p>
<p>Puchberg sent the hundred gulden. Encouraged, Mozart appealed to him
(June 17) for a loan of “one or two thousand gulden for a year or two at
a suitable rate of interest.” He had left unpaid the arrears of rent at
his former home; the landlord threatened to have him jailed; Mozart
borrowed to pay him. Apparently Puchberg sent less than was asked, for
the desperate composer made further appeals in June and July. It was in
those harassed months that Mozart composed the three “Great
Symphonies.”</p>
<p>He welcomed an invitation from Prince Karl von Lichnowsky to ride
with him to Berlin. For that trip he borrowed a hundred gulden from
Franz Hofdemel. Prince and pauper left Vienna April 8, 1789. At Dresden
Mozart played before Elector Frederick Augustus, and received a hundred
ducats. At Leipzig he gave a public performance on Bach’s organ, and was
stirred by the Thomasschule choir’s singing of Bach’s motet “Singet dem
Herrn.” At Potsdam and Berlin (April 28 to May 28) he played for
Frederick Wil- liam II, and received a gift of seven hundred florins,
with commissions for six quartets and six sonatas. But his gains were
spent with mysterious celerity; an unverified rumor ascribed part of the
outlet to a liaison with a Berlin singer, Henriette Baronius. 8 8 On May
23 he wrote to Constanze: “As regards my return, you will have to look
forward to me more than to the money.” 89 He reached home June 4,
1789.</p>
<p>Constanze, pregnant again, needed doctors and medicines and an
expensive trip to take the waters at Baden-bei-Wien. Mozart again turned
to Puchberg: Great God! I would not wish my worst enemy to be in my
present position. If you, most beloved friend and brother [Mason]
forsake me, we are altogether lost — both my unfortunate and blameless
self and my poor sick wife and chil-</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>dren…. All depends… upon whether you will lend me another five hun-
dred gulden. Until my affairs are settled, I undertake to pay back ten
gulden a month; and then I shall pay back the whole sum…. Oh, God! I can
hardly bring myself to dispatch this letter, and yet I must! — For God’s
sake forgive me, only forgive me ! 90</p>
<p>Puchberg sent him 150 gulden, most of whi ch went to pay Constanze’s
bills at Baden. On November 1 6, at home, she gave birth to a daughter,
who died the same day. Joseph II helped by commissioning Mozart and
Ponte to write a dramma giocoso on an old theme (used by Marivaux in Le
Jeu de V amour et du hasard, 1730); two men disguise themselves to test
the fidelity of their fiancees; they find them pliable, but forgive them
on the ground that “cost fan tutte”—’ “so do all” women; thence the
opera’s name. It was hardly a subject fit for Mozart’s tragic mood
(except that Constanze had flirted a bit at Baden), but he provided for
the clever and witty libretto music that is the very embodiment of
cleverness and wit; seldom has nonsense been so glori- fied. It had a
moderately successful premiere on January 26, 1790, and four repetitions
in a month, bringing Mozart a hundred ducats. Then Joseph II died
(February 20), and the Vienna theaters were closed till April 12.</p>
<p>Mozart hoped that the new Emperor would find work for him, but Leo-
pold II ignored him. He ignored Ponte too, who went off to England and
America, and ended (1838) as a teacher of Italian in what is now
Columbia University in New York. 91 Mozart made further appeals to
Puchberg (De- cember 29, 1789, January 20, February 20, April 1, 8, and
23, 1790), never in vain, but seldom receiving all that he asked. Early
in May he pleaded for six hundred gulden to pay rent due; Puchberg sent
a hundred. He confessed to Puchberg on May 17, “I am obliged to resort
to moneylenders”; in that letter he numbered his pupils as only two, and
asked his friend “to spread the news that I am willing to give lessons.”
92 However, he was too nervous and impa - tient to be a good teacher.
Sometimes he failed to keep appointments with his pupils; sometimes he
played billiards with them instead of giving a les- son. 93 But when he
found a student of promising talent he gave himself un- reservedly; so
he gladly and successfully taught Johann Hummel, who came to him (1787)
at the age of eight and became a famous pianist in the next
generation.</p>
<p>Serious illnesses added pains to Mozart’s griefs. One physician
diagnosed his ailments as “excretory pyelitis with pyonephritis, latent
focal lesions of the kidneys, tending inescapably toward eventual total
nephritic insuffi- ciency” 94 — i.e., a disabling pus- forming
inflammation of the kidneys. “I am absolutely wretched today,” he wrote
to Puchberg on August 14, 1790. “I could not sleep at all last night
because of pain…. Picture to yourself my condition — ill, and consumed
with worries and anxieties…. Can you not help me with a trifle? The
smallest sum would be very welcome.” Puchberg sent him ten gulden.</p>
<p>Despite his physical condition Mozart undertook a desperate expedient
to support his family. Leopold II was to be crowned at Frankfurt October
9, 1 790. Seventeen court musicians were in the Emperor’s retinue, but
Mozart was not invited. He went nevertheless, accompanied by Franz
Hofer, his</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>MOZART</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>violinist brother-in- law. To defray the expense he pawned the
family’s silver plate. At Frankfurt on October 1 5 he played and
conducted his Piano Con- certo in D (K. 537), which he had composed
three years before, but which the whim of history has named the
“Coronation Concerto”— hardly among his best. “It was a splendid
success,” he wrote to his wife, “from the point of view of honor and
glory, but a failure as far as money was concerned.” 95 He returned to
Vienna having earned little more than his expenses. In No- vember he
moved to cheaper lodgings at Rauhensteingasse 70, where he was to
die.</p>

<p>He was kept alive for another year by three commissions coming in</p>
<p>crowded succession. In May, 1791, Emanuel Schikaneder, who produced
German operas and plays in a suburban theater, offered him the sketch of
a libretto about a magic flute, and appealed to his brother Mason to
provide the music. Mozart agreed. When Constanze, pregnant once more,
went to Baden-bei- Wien in June, he accepted Schikaneder’s invitation to
spend his days in a garden house near the theater, where he could
compose Die Xau- ber flote under the manager’s prodding. In the evenings
he joined Schikaneder</p>
<p>In that month a request came from an anonymous stranger, offering a
hun- dred ducats for a Requiem Mass to be secretly composed and to be
trans- mitted to him without any public acknowledgment of its
authorship. Mozart turned from the merriment of The Magic Flute to the
theme of death, when, in August, he received a commission from Prague
for an opera, La clemenza di Tito , to be performed there at the
approaching coronation of Leopold II as king of Bohemia. He had barely a
month to set Metastasio’s old libretto to new music. He worked at it in
shaky coaches and noisy inns while journey- ing to Prague with his wife.
The opera was sung on September 6 to mild applause. Mozart had tears in
his eyes as he left the one city that had be- friended him, and as he
realized that the Emperor had witnessed his failure. His only
consolations were the two hundred ducats’ fee and the later news that
the repetition of the opera at Prague on September 30 was a complete
success.</p>
<p>On that day he conducted from the piano the premiere of Die 2
jauberfldte. The story was in part a fairy tale, in part an exaltation
of Masonic initiation ritual. Mozart gave his best art to the
composition, though he kept most of the arias to a simple melodic line
congenial to his middle-class audience. He lavished coloratura
pyrotechnics on the Queen of the Night, but privately he laughed at
coloratura singing as “cut - up noodles.” 97 The March of the</p>

<p>Priests, opening the second act, is Masonic music; the aria of the
high priest, “In diesen heiligen Hallen”— “In these holy halls we know
nothing of re - venge, and love for their fellow men is the guiding rule
of the initiated”— is the claim of Freemasonry to have restored that
brotherhood of man which Christianity had once preached. (Goethe
compared The Magic Flute to Part II of Faust, which also preached
brotherhood; and, himself a Mason, he spoke of the opera as having “a
higher meaning which will not escape the</p>
<p>This last triumph came when Mozart already felt the hand of death
touch- ing him. As if to accentuate the irony, a group of Hungarian
nobles now assured him an annual subscription of a thousand florins, and
an Amsterdam publisher offered him a still larger sum for the exclusive
right to print some of his work. In September he received an invitation
from Ponte to come to London; he replied: “I would gladly follow your
advice, but how can I?… My condition tells me that my hour strikes; I am
about to give up my life. The end has come before I could prove my
talent. Yet life was beau- tiful.” 100</p>
<p>In his final months he gave his failing strength to the Requiem. For
several weeks he worked at it feverishly. When his wife sought to turn
him to less gloomy concerns he told her, “I am writing this Requiem for
myself; i t will serve for my funeral service.” 101 He composed the
Kyrie and parts of the Dies Irae, the Tuba Mirum, the Rex Tremendae, the
Recordare, the Confu- tatis, the Lacrimosa, the Domine, and the Hostias;
these fragments were left unrevised, and reveal the disordered state of
a mind facing collapse. Franz Xaver Siissmayr completed the Requiem
remarkably well.</p>
<p>In November Mozart’s hands and feet began to swell painfully, and
partial paralysis set in. He had to take to his bed. On those evenings
when The Magic Flute was performed he laid his watch beside him and
followed each act in imagination, sometimes humming the arias. On his
last day he asked for the score of the Requiem; he sang the alto part,
Mme. Schack sang the so- prano, Franz Hofer the tenor, Herr Gerl the
bass; when they came to the Lacrimosa, Mozart wept. He predicted that he
would die that night. A priest administered the last sacrament. Toward
evening Mozart lost consciousness, but shortly after midnight he opened
his eyes; then he turned his face to the wall, and soon suffered no more
(December 5, 1791).</p>
<p>Neither his wife nor his friends could give him a fitting funeral.
The body was blessed in St. Stephen’s Church on December 6, and was
buried in the chur chyard of St. Mark’s. No grave had been bought; the
corpse was low - ered into a common vault made to receive fifteen or
twenty paupers. No cross or stone marked the place, and when, a few days
later, the widow came there to pray, no one could tell her t he spot
that covered Mozart’s remains.</p>
