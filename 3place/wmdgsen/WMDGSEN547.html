<h4 id="chapter-xxix-the-english-people">CHAPTER XXIX The English
People</h4>
<p>*756-89</p>
<p>I. ENGLISH WAYS</p>
<p>S O much for the government; let us now consider the people.</p>
<p>First, look at their figures. Doubtless Reynolds idealized them,
show- ing us mostly the titled fortunate, and glorifying their
corpulence with the robes and insignia of dignity. But hear Goethe on
the Englishmen he saw in Weimar: “What fine, handsome people they are!”—
and he worried lest these confident young Britishers, bearing empire in
their stride, would disen- chant German girls with German men. 1 Several
of these youths kept their figures into later years, but many of them,
as they passed from the play- grounds of their schools to the pleasures
of the table, swelled in paunch and jowls, blossomed like a red, red
rose, and fought in the still of the night the gout they had fed in the
jovial day. Some Elizabethan robustness had been lost in Restoration
roistering. English women, by contrast, were more beauti- ful than ever,
at least on the easels: refined features, flowered and ribboned hair,
mysteries in silk, poems of stately grace.</p>
<p>Sartorial class distinctions were disappearing on the streets as a
new plenty of cotton clothing issued from the multiplying mills, but on
formal occasions they remained; Lord Derwentwater rode to his execution
in a scarlet coat and waistcoat laced with gold. 2 Wigs were waning, and
they vanished when Pitt II taxed the powder that deodorized them; they
survived on doctors, judges, barristers, and Samuel Johnson; most men
were now content with their own hair, gathered at the back of the neck
in a ribboned queue. About 1785 some men extended their breeches from
knees to calves; in 1793, in- spired by the triumphant French
sans-culottes, they let them reach the ankle, and modern man was bom.
Women still laced their bosoms to the verge of suffocation, but the
hoopskirt was losing fashion and breadth, and dresses were assuming
those flowing lines that fascinated our youth.</p>
<p>Cleanliness was next to godliness in rarity, for water was a luxury.
Rivers were lovely but usually polluted; the Thames was a drainage
canal. 3 Most London houses had water piped into them three times a week
for three shillings per quarter; 4 some had mechanical toilets; a few
had bathrooms with running water. Most privies (wh ose current name was
“Jerichos”) were ex - tramural, built over open pits that sent their
seepage through the soil to wells from which much of the drinking water
came. 5 Nevertheless public sanita- tion was improving; hospitals were
multiplying; infantile mortality fell from seventy-four per hundred
births in 1749 to forty-one in 1809. 6</p>
<p>728</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX )</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>729</p>
<p>No one drank water if he could get something safer. Beer was
considered a food, necessary for any vigorous work; wine was a favorite
medicine, whiskey was a portable stove, and drunkenness was a venial
sin, if not a necessary part of social conformity. “I remember,” said
Dr. Johnson, “when all the decent people in Lichfield got drunk every
night, and were not the worse thought of.” 7 Pitt II came drunk to the
House of Commons, and Lord Cornwallis went drunk to the opera. 8 Some
hackney coachmen added to their incomes by cruising the streets at late
hours, picking up gentlemen who were “as drunk as a lord,” and d
elivering them to their homes. Drunk- enness declined as the century
advanced; tea took up some of the task of warming the vitals and loosing
the tongue. Tea imports rose from a hundred pounds in 1668 to fourteen
million pounds in 1786. 9 The coffeehouses now served more tea than
coffee.</p>
<p>Meals were hearty, bloody, and immense. Dinner came about four in the
afternoon for the upper classes, and was progressively deferred till six
as the century declined. A hurried man might ease his hunger with a
sandwich. This contraption took its name from the fourth Earl of
Sandwich, who, not to interrupt his gambling with dinner, ate two slices
of bread divided by meat. Vegetables were eaten under protest. “Smoking
has gone out [of fashion],” Johnson told Boswe ll in 1773; but tobacco
was taken in the form of snuff. Opium was widely used as a sedative or a
cure.</p>
<p>At table the Englishman could drink himself into loquacity, and then
the conversation might rival that of the Paris salons in wit and excel
it in sub- stance. One day (April 9, 1778), as Johnson, Gibbon, Boswell,
Allan Ram- say, and other friends gathered in the home of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the Doctor remarked: “I question if in Paris such a company as
is sitting around this table could be got toge ther in less than half a
year.” 10 Aristocratic gath - erings preferred wit to learning, and
Selwyn to Johnson. George Selwyn was the Oscar Wilde of the eighteenth
century. He had been expelled from Oxford (1745) because “he did
impiously affect to perso nate the Blessed Saviour, and did ridicule the
institution of the Holy Sacrament,” 11 but this did not prevent him from
getting several lucrative sinecures in the adminis- tration, or from
sitting and sleeping in the House of Commons from 1747 to 1780. He had a
host of friends, but never married. He had a passion for executions, but
skipped that of a namesake of Charles James Fox, a political enemy for
whom fie hopefully awaited a Tyburn elevation — “I make a point of never
attending rehearsal s.” 12 He and Horace Walpole were intimate friends
for sixty-three years, without a cloud or a woman between them.</p>
<p>Those who did not enjoy executions could choose among a hundred other
amusements, from whist or bird-watching to horse races or prize fights.
Cricket was now the national game. The poor squandered their wages in
taverns, the rich gambled their fortunes in clubs or in private homes;
so Wal- pole, at Lady Hertford’s, “lost fifty -six guineas before I
could say an Ave Maria.” 13 James Gillray, in famous caricatures, called
such hostesses “Faro’s daughters.” 14 To take losses calmly was a prime
requisite of an English gen - tleman, even if he ended by blowing out
his brains.</p>
<p>730</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XIt was a man’s world, legally, socially, and morally. Men took most
of their social pleasures with other men; not till 1770 was a club
organized for bisexual membership. Men discouraged intellect in women,
and then com- plained that women were incapable of intellectual
conversation. Some women, nevertheless, managed to develop intellects.
Mrs. Elizabeth Carter learned to speak Latin, French, Italian, and
German, studied Hebrew, Por- tuguese, and Arabic, and translated
Epictetus with a Greek scholarship that drew Johnson’s praise. She
protested against the reluctance of men to discuss ideas with women, and
she was one of those ladies who made the “blue - stockings” the talk of
literate London.</p>
<p>The name was first given to the mixed gatherings at the home of
Mrs. Elizabeth Vesey in Hertford Street, Mayfair. At these evening
assemblies card playing was banned and discussion of literature was
encouraged. Meet- ing, one day, Benjamin Stillingfleet, who had a
momentary reputation as poet, botanist, and philosopher, Mrs. Vesey
invited him to her next “rout.” He excused himself on the ground that he
had no clothes fit for a party. He was wearing blue hose. “Don’t mind
dress,” she told him; “come in your blue stockings.” He came. “Such was
the excellence of his conversation,” Boswell relates, “that… it used to
be said, ‘we do nothing without the blue stockings’; and thus by degrees
the title was established,” 15 and Mrs. Vesey ’s group came to be called
the Bas Bleu Society. There came Garrick and Walpole, and there one
evening Johnson awed all with pontifical dis- course.</p>
<p>But “the Queen of the Blues,” as Johnson called her, was Elizabeth
Robin - son Montagu. She was married to Edward Montagu, grandson of the
first Earl of Sandwich and relative of Edward Wortley Montagu, husband
of the volatile Lady Mary whom we celebrated in pages gone by. 16
Elizabeth was a wit, a scholar, an author; her essay The Writings and
Genius of Shake- speare (1769) indignantly defended the national bard
against the strictures of Voltaire. She was rich, and could afford to
entertain in style. She made the Chinese Room in her Berkeley Square
home the favorite center of London’s intellect and beauty; there came
Reynolds, Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Gar- rick, Horace Walpole, Fanny
Burney, Hannah More; there artists met law- yers, prelates met
philosophers, poets met ambassadors. Mrs. Montagu’s “excellent cook” put
them all in good humor, but no liquor was served, and intoxication was
taboo. She played Maecenas to budding authors, and scat- tered bounty.
Other London ladies — Mrs. Thrale, Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Monckton — opened
their homes to talent and charm. London society became</p>

<li>ENGLISH MORALS</li>
</ol>
<p>“In every society,” said Adam Smith, “where the distinction of ranks
has once been completely established, there have always been two
different schemes or systems of morality current at the same time; of
which one may</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>73 *</p>
<p>be called the strict or austere, the other the liberal, or, if you
will, the loose system. The former is generally admired and revered by
the common people, the latter… more esteemed and adopted by what are
called people of fashion.” 17 John Wesley, who belonged to the austere
class, described Eng - lish morality in 1757 as a medley of smuggling,
false oaths, political corrup- tion, drunkenness, gambling, cheating in
business, chicanery in the courts, servility in the clergy, worldliness
among Quakers, and private embezzle- ment of charitable funds. 18 It is
an old refrain.</p>
<p>Then, as now, sexual differentiation was far from complete. Some
women tried to be men, and almost succeeded; we hear of cases where
women dis- guised themselves as men and maintained the deception till
death; some joined the army or navy as men, drank, smoked, and swore
like men, fought in battle, and bore flogging manfully. 1 9 Toward 1772
“Macaronis” became prominent on London streets; they were young men who
wore their hair in long curls, dressed in rich materials and striking
colors, and “wenched with - out passion”; Selwyn described them as “a
kind of animal neither male nor female, but of the neuter gender.” 20
Homosexualism had its brothels, though homosexual acts, if detected and
proved, were punishable with death.</p>
<p>The double standard flourished. A thousand bordellos served tumescent
men, but those men branded female unchastity as a crime for which only
death could atone. So the gentle Goldsmith:</p>
<p>When lovely woman stoops to folly</p>
<p>And finds too late that men betray, —</p>
<p>What charm can soothe her melancholy,</p>
<p>What art can wash her guilt away?</p>
<p>The only art her guilt to cover,</p>
<p>To hide her shame from every eye,</p>
<p>To give repentance to her lover</p>
<p>And wring his bosom, is — to die. 21</p>
<p>Early marriage was advised as a preventive of such calamities. The
law al- lowed girls to marry at twelve, boys at fourteen. Most women of
the edu- cated classes married young, and deferred their deviations; but
then the double standard checked them. Hear Johnson on adultery ( 1768)
:</p>
<p>Confusion of progeny constitutes the essence of the crime, and
therefore the woman who breaks her marriage vows is much more criminal
than a man who does it. A man, to be sure, is criminal in the sight of
God, but he does not do his wife a very material injury if he does not
insult her; if, for instance, from mere wantonness of appetite, he
steals privately to her chambermaid. Sir, a wife ought not greatly to
resent this. I would not receive home a daughter who had run away from
her husband on that account. A wife should study to reclaim her husband
by more attention to please him. Sir, a man will not, once in a hundred
instances, leave his wife and go to a harlot, if his wife has not been
negligent of pleasing. 22</p>
<p>In Boswell’s own circle it was taken as quite ordinary that men
should occasionally go to a prostitute. In the aristocracy — even in the
royal family- adultery was widespread. The Duke of Grafton, while chief
minister, lived openly with Nancy Parsons, and took her to the opera in
the face of the</p>
<p>73 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XQueen. 23 Divorce was rare; it could not be obtained except by act
of Parlia- ment, and as this cost “several thousand pounds,” it was a
luxury of the rich; only 132 such grants were recorded in the years 1
670-1 800. 24 It was gener- ally supposed that the morals of the
commonalty were better than those of the aristocracy, but Johnson
thought otherwise (1778): “There is as much fornication and adultery
amongst farmers as amongst noblemen,” and “so far as I have observed,
the higher in rank, the richer ladies are, they are the better
instructed, and the more virtuous.” 25 The literature of the day, as in
Fielding and Burns, pictured the peasant as celebrating almost every
week- end with a carouse, spending half his pay in taverns, and some on
tarts. Each class sinned according to its ways and means.</p>
<p>The poor fought one another with fists and cudgels, the rich with
pistols and swords. Dueling was a point of honor in the nobility; Fox
fought Adam, Shelburne fought Fullerton, Pitt II fought Tierney; it was
difficult to get through a titled life without at least one puncture.
Many stories attest the sang-froid of British gentlemen in these
encounters. Lord Shelburne, having received a wound in the groin,
assured his anxious seconds, “I don’t think Lady Shelburne will be the
worse for it.” 26</p>
<p>Worse than the looseness of sexual morals was the brutality of
industrial exploitation: the merciless consumption of human life in the
grasp for profits; the use of children six years of age in factories or
as chimneysweeps; the reduction of thousands of men and women to such
destitution that they sold themselves into payless bondage for passage
to America; the govern- mental prote ction of the slave trade as a
precious source of England’s wealth…</p>
<p>From Liverpool, Bristol, and London — as from Holland and France —
merchants sailed to Africa, bought and captured Negroes, shipped them to
the West Indies, sold them there, and returned to Europe with lucrative
cargoes of sugar, tobacco, or rum. By 1776 English traders had carried
three million slaves to America; add 250,000 who died in passage and
were thrown into the sea. The British government granted an annual
subsidy of £ 10,000 to the African Company and its successor, the
Regulated Company, toward the maintenance of their forts and posts in
Africa, on the ground that they were “the most beneficial to this island
of all the Companies that were ever formed by our merchant s.” 27 George
III (1770) forbade the governor of Virginia “to assent to any law by
which the importations of slaves should be in any respect prohibited or
obstructed.” 26 In 1771 there were in England about fourteen thousand
Negroes, who had been brought in by their colonial masters, or had
escaped from them; some were used as domestic servants with no right to
wages; 29 some were sold at public auction, as in Liverpool in 1766. 30
In 1772, however, an English court ruled that a slave automatically
became a free man the moment he touched English soil. 31</p>
<p>Slowly the conscience of England awoke to the contradiction between
this traffic and the simplest dictates of religion or morality. The
finest spirits in Britain denounced it: George Fox, Daniel Defoe, James
Thomson, Rich- ard Steele, Alexander Pope, William Paley, John Wesley,
William Cowper,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>Francis Hutcheson, William Robertson, Adam Smith, Josiah Wedgwood,
Horace Walpole, Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Charles James Fox. The
first organized opposition to slavery was by the Quakers in England and
America; in 1761 they excluded from their membership all persons engaged
in the traffic; in 1783 they forme d an association “for the relief and
liberation of the Negro slaves in the West Indies, and for the
discouragement of the slave trade on the coast of Africa.” 32 In 1787
Granville Sharp formed a com - mittee to advance abolition; in 1789
William Wilberforce began his long campaign in the House of Commons to
end the English trade in slaves. The merchants repeatedly persuaded the
House to defer action; it was not till 1807 that Parliament enacted that
no vessel should carry slaves from any port within the British dominions
after May 1, 1807, or to any British colony after March 1, 1808. 33</p>
<p>In political morality England now touched nadir. The rotten-borough
system flourished, and the nabobs outbid all other purchasers. Franklin
de- plore d the American war for a peculiar reason: “Why did they not
let me go on? If they [the colonies] had given me a fourth of the money
they have spent on the war, we should have had our independence without
spending a drop of blood. I would have bought all the Parliament, the
whole govern- ment of Britain.” 34 Corruption ruled in the Church, the
universities, the judiciary, the civil service, the army and navy, and
the councils of the King. Military discipline was more rigorous than in
any other European country 35 with the possible exception of Prussia;
and when the men were demobilized nothing was done to ease their
transition into a useful and law-abiding life.</p>
<p>Social morality hovered between the essential good nature of the
individ- ual Englishman and the irresponsible brutality of mobs. Between
1765 and 1780 there were nine major riots, nearly all in London; we
shall see an ex- ample presently. Crowds ran to a hanging as a holiday,
and sometimes bribed the hangman to be especially thorough in flogging a
prisoner. 36 The penal code was the severest in Europe. Language in
nearly all classes tended to violence and profanity. The press engaged
in orgies of vituperation and cal- umny. Almost everyone gambled, if
only in the national lottery, and almost everyone drank to excess.</p>
<p>The faults of the English character were allied to its basic quality
— a hearty, lusty vigor. The peasant and the factory laborer expended it
in toil, the nation showed it in every crisis but one. Out of that vigor
came the voracious appetite, the high spirits, the resort to
prostitutes, the brawls in the pubs and the duels in the park, the
passion of parliamentary debate, the capacity for suffering silently,
the proud claim of every Englishman that his home was his castle, not to
be entered except by due process of law. When, in this age, England was
defeated, it was by Englishmen who had transplanted to America the
English passion for freedom. Mme. du Deffand noted the diversity of
individuals in the Englishmen whom she met, and most of whom she never
saw. “Each one,” she said, “is original; there are</p>
<p>734</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xcertain that no other country produces so many singular and
discriminate characters as England.” 38 Look at Reynolds’ men: they
agree only in their pride of country and class, their ruddy faces, their
bold confronting of the world. It was a powerful breed.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>FAITH AND DOUBT</li>
</ol>
<p>The English masses remained faithful to their various forms of the
Chris- tian creed. The most widely read book, next to the Bible, was
Nelson’s Festivals and Fasts, a guide to the ecclesiastical year. 39
Johnson’s Prayers and</p>
<p>Private clubs offered relief from public conformity. Many aristocrats
joined one or another of the Freemason lodges. These condemned atheism
as stupid, and required of their members a belief in God, but they
inculcated toleration of differences on all other doctrines of religion.
45 In the Lunar Society of Birmingham manufacturers like Matthew
Boulton, James Watt, and Josiah Wedgwood heard without horror the
heresies of Joseph Priestley and Erasmus Darwin. 46 Nevertheless the
furor of deism had passed, and nearly all freethinkers accepted a truce
by which they would not interfere with the propagation of the faith if
the Church allowed some latitude to sin. The English upper classes, with
their sense of order and moderation, avoided the reckless radicalism of
the French Enlightenment; they recognized the intimate union of religion
and government, and were too economical to re- place a supernatural
morality with an infinitude of police.</p>
<p>Since they were now servants of the state, the Anglican bishops, like
the Catholic cardinals, thought themselves entitled to a measure of

<p>joyment. Cowper satirized in bitter lines 47 the clergymen who
scrambled like politicians for richer or additional benefices; but many
others led lives of quiet attention to their duties, and several were
scholarly and able defenders of the faith. William Paley’s Principles of
Moral and Political Philosophy (1785) displayed a generous spirit of
doctrinal latitude and toleration, and his Evidences of Christianity
(1794) persuasively presented the argument from design. He welcomed into
holy orders men of freethinking tendencies so long as they preached the
essentials of religion and served as moral leaders in their communities.
48</p>
<p>Dissenters — Baptists, Presbyterians, and Independents (Puritans) —
enjoyed religious toleration provided they adhered to Trinitarian
Christianity; but no one could hold political or military office, or
enter Oxford or Cambridge, without accepting the Anglican Church and its
Thirty-nine Articles. Meth- odism continued to spread among the lower
classes. In 1784 it broke its tenuous ties with the Established Church,
but meanwhile it had inspired the “Evangelical movement” in a minority
of Anglican clergymen. These men admired Wesley, and agreed with him
that the Gospel, or Evangel, should be preached precisely as handed down
in the New Testament, with no concessions to rationalist or textual
criticism.</p>
<p>England’s memory of the Gunpowder Plot, the Great Rebellion, and the
reign of James II still kept on the statute books the old laws against
Roman Catholics. Most of these laws were no longer enforced, but many
disabilities remained. Catholics could not legally buy or inherit land
except through a subterfuge and payment of a double tax on their
property. They were ex- cluded from the army and navy, from the legal
profession, from voting or standing for Parliament, and from all
governmental posts. Even so, their number was growing. In 1781 they
included seven peers, twenty-two baron- ets, 150 “gentlemen.” Mass was
celebrated in private homes, and only two or three arrests for this
offense are recorded in the sixty years of George Ill’s reign.</p>
<p>In 1778 Sir George Savile offered Parliament a bill for “Catholic
relief,” legalizing the purchase and inheritance of land by Catholics,
and allowing Catholics to enlist in the armed forces without renouncing
their religion. The bill was passed, and met with no serious opposition
from the Anglican bishops in the House of Lords. It applied only to
England, but in 1779 Lord North moved that it be extended to Scotland.
When news of this proposal reached the Lowlands, riots broke out in
Edinburgh and Glasgow (January,</p>
<p>1779); several houses inhabited by Catholics were burned to the
ground; the shops of Catholic tradesmen were looted and wrecked; the
houses of Protestants — like Robertson the historian — who expressed
sympathy for the Catholics were likewise attacked, and the outbreak
ended only when Edin- burgh magistrates announced that the Act for
Catholic Relief would not be applied to Scotland.</p>
<p>A Scottish member of Parliament, Lord George Gordon, took up the “No
- Popery” cause in England. On May 29, 1780, he presided over a meet -
ing of the “Protestant Association,” which planned a mass march to
present a petition for repeal of the Relief Act of 1778. On June 2 sixty
thousand</p>
<p>736 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xmen, wearing blue cockades, surrounded Parliament House. Many
members were mauled on their way in; the carriages of Lords Mansfield,
Thurlow, and Stormont were demolished; some noble lords reached their
seats wigless, disheveled, and trembling. 49 Gordon and eight of his
followers entered the House of Commons; they presented a petition,
allegedly bearing 120,000 signatures, calling for repeal, and demanded
immediate action as the sole alternative to invasion of the House by the
mob. The members resisted. They sent for troops to check the crowd; they
locked all doors; a relative of Gordon declared that he would kill him
the moment any outsider forced his way into the chamber; then the House
voted to adjourn till June 6. Troops arrived and cleared a way for the
members to return to their homes. Two Catholic chapels, belonging to
Sardinian and Bavarian ministers, were gutted, and their furniture made
a bonfire in the streets. The crowd dis- persed, but on June 5 rioters
looted other foreign chapels, and burned sev- eral private homes.</p>
<p>On June 6 the mob regathered, broke into Newgate Gaol, freed the
pris- oners, captured an arsenal, and marched, armed, through the
capital. Nobles barricaded themselves in their homes; Horace Walpole
complimented himself on guarding a duchess in his “garrison” in Berkeley
Square. 50 On June 7 more houses were looted and burned; distilleries
were entered, and thirst was freely quenched; several rioters were
cremated as they lay intoxicated in burning buildings. The London
magistrates, who alone had legal author- ity over the municipal guard,
refused to order them to fire upon the crowd. George III called out the
citizen militia, and bade them shoot whenever the mob used or threatened
violence. Alderman John Wilkes earned forgiveness from the King, and
lost his popularity with the populace, by mounting a horse and joining
with the militia in attempting to disperse the assemblage. The militia,
attacked by the rioters, fired upon them, killing twenty-two. The crowd
fled.</p>
<p>On June 9 the riot flared again. Houses — whether of Catholics or of
Prot- estants — were pillaged and burned, and firemen were prevented
from extin- guishing the flames. 51 Troops suppressed the uprising at
the cost of 285 men killed and 173 wounded; 1 35 rioters were arrested,
twenty-one were hanged. Gordon was arrested in flight toward Scotland;
he proved that he had taken no part in the riots; he was freed. Burke
secured the approval of the Com- mons for reaffirmation of the Act for
Catholic Relief in England. An act of 1791 extended legal toleration to
Catholic worship and education, but no Catholic church was to have a
steeple or a bell. 52</p>

<li>BLACKSTONE, BENTHAM, AND THE LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>A learned jurist thought “the publication of Blackstone’s Comment
aries… in some ways the most notable event in the history of the law.”
53 This is patriotic, but it serves to point the reverential awe with
which English- speaking students, till our time, approached the
Commentaries on the Laws of England which William Blackstone published
in four volumes and two</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>737</p>
<p>housand pages in 1765-69. Despite or because of its size it was
acclaimed as a monument of learning and wisdom; every lord had it in his
library, and George III took it to his heart as the apotheosis of
kings.</p>
<p>Blackstone was the son of a London tradesman rich enough to send him
through Oxford and the Middle Temple to the practice of law. His
lectures at Oxford (1753-63) reduced the contradictions and absurdities
of the stat- utes to some order and logic, and expounded the result with
clarity and charm. In 1761 he was elected to Parliament; in 1763 he was
appointed so- licitor general to Queen Charlotte; in 1770 he began
service as judge in the Court of Common Pleas. Addicted to study and
hating locomotion, he sank into a gentle but premature decomposition,
and died in 1780 at the age of fifty-seven.</p>
<p>His opus maximum had the virtues of his lectures: logical
arrangement, lucid exposition, and a gracious style. Jeremy Bentham, his
passionate oppo- nent, praised him as the man who had “taught
jurisprudence to speak the</p>
<p>He loved England and Christianity just as he found them, and would
hardly admit any flaw in either. He was more orthodox than Bishop War-
burton, and more royalist than George III. “The King of England is not
only the chief, but properly the sole, magistrate of the nation…. He may
reject what bills, may make what treaties,… may pardon what offenses he
pleases, unless the Constitution hath expressly, or by evident
consequence, laid down some exception or boundary.” 56 Blackstone placed
the king above Parliament and above the law; the king “is not only
incapable of doing wrong, but even of thinking wrong”— by which,
however, Blackstone meant that there was no law above the king by which
the king could be judged. But he warmed the pride of all England when he
defined “the absolute rights of every Englishman: the right of personal
security, the right of personal liberty, and th e right of private
property.” 57</p>
<p>Blackstone’s conception of English law as a system permanently valid
because ultimately grounded on the Bible as the word of God eminently
pleased his time, but it discouraged the growth of English jurisprudence
and the reform of penology and prisons; it is to his credit, however,
that he ap- plauded the efforts of John Howard to ameliorate the
conditions in British jails. 58</p>
<p>Howard took Christianity not as a system of law but as an appeal to
the heart. Appointed sheriff at Bedford (1773), he was appalled by
conditions in the local prison. The jailer and his aides received no
salary; they lived on fees exacted from the prisoners. No man was
released, after serving his term, until he had paid all fees required of
him; many men remained incarcerated for months after the court had found
them innocent. Traveling from county to county, Howard found similar
abuses, or worse. Defaulting debtors and</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xfirst offenders were thrown in with hardened criminals. Most
prisoners wore chains, heavy or light according to the fee they paid.
Each prisoner was allowed one- or twopenceworth of bread daily; for
additional food he had to pay, or rely on relatives or friends. Three
pints of water were allowed to each inmate daily for drinking and
washing. No heat was provided in winter, and there was little
ventilation in summer. The stench in these dun- geons was so strong that
it clung to Howard’s clothes long af ter he emerged. “Prison fever” and
other diseases killed many prisoners; some died of slow starvation. 59
At Newgate Gaol in London fifteen to twenty men lived in a room
twenty-three by twenty-five feet.</p>
<p>In 1774 Howard presented to Parliament his report on fifty prisons
visited; the House of Commons passed an act requiring hygienic reforms
in the jails, providing salaries for the jailers, and freeing all
prisoners against whom the grand jury had failed to find a true bill. In
1775-76 Howard visited Conti- nental prisons. He found those of Holland
best equipped and relatively humane; among the worst were those in
Hanover, ruled by George III. The publication of Howard’s book The State
of the Prisons in England and Wales,… and an Account of Some Foreign
Prisons (1777) stirred the sleeping conscience of the nation. Parliament
voted funds for two “peni - tentiary houses,” in which an attempt was
made to redeem prisoners by in - dividual treatment, supervised labor,
and religious instruction. Howard re- sumed his travels, and reported
his findings in new editions of his book. In 1789 he toured Russia; at
Kherson he caught camp fever, and died (1790). His efforts for reform
produced only modest results. The act of 1774 was ignored by most
jailers and justices. Descriptions of London prisons in 1 804 and 1817
showed no improvement since Howard’s time; “perhaps the condi - tion of
things had become worse instead of better.” 60 Reform had to wait for
Dickens’ acco unt of the New Marshalsea Prison in Little Dorrit (1855).
Jeremy Bentham’s diverse labors for reform in law, government, and
education fall mostly after this period, but his Fragment on Government
(1776) belongs here, as being principally a criticism of Blackstone. He
scorned the jurist’s worship of tradition; he pointed out that “whatever
novo is established, once was innovation”; 61 present conservatism is
reverence of past radicalism; consequently those who advocate reforms
are quite as pa- triot ic as those who tremble at the thought of change.
“Under a government of laws, what is the motto of a good citizen? To
obey punctually, to censure freely.” 62 Bentham rejected Blackstone’s
view of royal sovereignty; a good government will distribute powers,
encourage each of these to check the others, and allow freedom of the
press, of peaceable assemblage and opposi- tion. In the last resort,
revolution may do less damage to the state than a dulling submission to
tyranny. 63 This little book was published in the year of the American
Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>In the same essay Bentham expounded that “greatest - happiness
principle” to which John Stuart Mill in 1863 gave the name
“utilitarianism.” “It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number
that is the measure of right and wrong.” 64 By this “principle of
utility” all moral and political proposals and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>practices should be judged, for “the business of gove rnment is to
promote the happiness of society.” 65 Bentham derived this “principle of
happiness” from Helvetius, Hume, Priestley, and Beccaria, 66 and his
general viewpoint was formed from reading the philosophies. 67</p>
<p>In 1780 he wrote, and in 1789 he published, An Introduction to the
Prin- ciples of Morals and Legislation, giving a more detailed and
philosophical exposition of his ideas. He reduced all conscious action
to the desire for pleasure or the fear of pain, and he defined happiness
as “the enjoyment of pleasure, security from pain.” 68 This seemed to
justify complete selfishness, but Bentham applied the happiness
principle to individuals as well as states: did the individual’s action
make for his greatest happiness? In the long run, he thought, the
individual obtains most pleasure or least pain by being just to his
fellow men.</p>
<p>Bentham practiced what he preached, for he devoted his life to a long
series of reform proposals: universal literate male adult suffrage,
secret ballot, annual Parliaments, free trade, public sanitation, the
amelioration of prisons, the cleansing of the judiciary, the abolition
of the House of Lords, the modernization and codification of the law in
terms intelligible to laymen, and the extension of international law
(Bentham invented this term 69 ). Many of these reforms were effected in
the nineteenth century, largely through the efforts of “utilitarians”
and “philosophical radicals” like James and John Stuart Mill, David
Ricardo, and George Grote.</p>
<p>Bentham was the last voice of the Enlightenment, the bridge between
the liberating thought of the eighteenth century and the reforms of the
nine- teenth. Even more than the philosophes he trusted to reason. He
remained a bachelor to the end of his life, though he was one of the
most lovable of men. When he died (June 6, 1832), aged eighty-four, he
willed that his body should be dissected in the presence of his friends.
It was, and the skeleton is still preserved in University College,
London, wearin g Bentham’s habitual dress. 70 On the day after his death
the historic Reform Bill that embodied many of his proposals was signed
by the King.</p>
<p>V. THE THEATER</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Performance</li>
</ol>
<p>This second half of the eighteenth century was rich in theater, poor
in drama. It saw some of the finest actors in history, and produced only
two dramatists whose works have escaped the Reaper: Sheridan, whom we
have already laid to rest, and Goldsmith, who will get a niche of his
own under the rubric of literature. Perhaps the dearth of serious plays
was cause and effect of the Shakespearean revival, which continued till
the end of the century.</p>
<p>The dramatists suffered from the tastes of the audience. There was
much discussion of histrionic, little of dramatic, technique and art.
The author received, usually as his only material reward, the profits of
the third per-</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xformance, if this arrived; some actors and actresses, however,
became as rich as prime ministers. Hired claques could damn a good play
with hostile noise, or make a worthless play an exciting success. A run
of twenty nights in a season was attained only by the most favored
dramas. Performances began at six or six-thirty, and ordinarily included
a three-hour play and a farce or a pantomime. Seats cost one to five
shillings; there were no reservations ex- cept by sending a servant to
buy and hold a place till the master or lady came. All seats were
backless benches. 71 Some favored spectators sat on the stage, until
Garrick ended this abomination (1764). All lighting was by candles in
chandeliers, which remained lit throughout the program. Cos- tumes,
before 1782, were eighteenth- century English regardless of the play’s
time or place; Cato, Caesar, and Lear were shown in knee breeches and
wigs.</p>
<p>Despite opposition by the clergy, and the competition of opera and
cir- cuses, the theater flourished, both in London and in the
“provinces.” Bath, Bristol, Liverpool, Nottingham, Manchester,
Birmingham, York, Edinburgh, and Dublin had good playhouses; some had
their own companies; and since the major companies went on tour, nearly
every town saw good acting. London was kept on edge by the lively
rivalry of two principal theaters. In 1750 both of these played Romeo
and Juliet nightly for the same two weeks, with Spranger Barry and
Susannah Cibber at Covent Garden, and Garrick and Miss Bellamy at Drury
Lane. Samuel Foote had his own Little Theatre in the Haymarket, where he
specialized in satirical mimicry; his imitations of Garrick were long a
misery in David’s life.</p>
<p>Never had the English stage seen so many first-class performers.
Charles Macklin opened the great age in 1741 with his productions of
Shakespeare; he was the first actor to present Shylock as a serious
character, though still as a merciless villain. (Not till Henry Irving
was Shylock interpreted with some sympathy.) John Philip Kemble closed
this century-long revival of Shakespeare. His supreme hours were when he
and his sister Sarah played Macbeth at Drury Lane in 1785.</p>
<p>Some memorable actresses now graced the stage. Peg Woffington was
gifted with stirring beauty of figure and face, but she lived loosely,
suffered a paralytic stroke in mid-play (1757), and died prematurely old
at forty-six (1760). Kitty Clive stayed with Garrick’s company twenty
-two years; she astonished London by her exemplary morals; after
quitting the stage (1769) she lived sixteen years in a house that Horace
Walpole gave her in Twicken- ham. Mrs. Hannah Pritchard was the foremost
tragedienne before Mrs. Sid- dons surpassed her as Lady Macbeth; she
absorbed her life in her acting, and (it was said) never read a book;
Johnson called her “an inspired idiot”; 72 but she outlasted many
belles, acting till within a few months of her death. Mrs. Frances
Abington starred as Beatrice, Portia, Ophelia, and Desdemona, but her
most famous role was as Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal. Mary
Robinson acquired her popular name “Perdita” from acting that part</p>
<p>The conscious goddess of the stage was Sarah Kemble Siddons. Born to

<p>74 1</p>
<p>raveling actor in a hostelry in Wales (1755), she married at eighteen
the actor William Siddons, and starred at nineteen in Otway’s Venice
Preserved. Garrick engaged her a year later, but critics pronounced “her
powers not equal to a London stage,” and Henry Woodward, who played
comic parts for Garrick, advised her to go back to country theaters for
a while. She did, and for six years she played in provincial towns.
Recalled to Drury Lane in 1782, she surprised everyone by her
development as an actress. She was the first to adopt in her roles the
dress of the period represented. Soon Garrick favored her for
Shakespearean roles, and London marveled at the dignity and pathos with
which she elevated the part of Lady Macbeth. Her private life won the
respect and friendship of eminent contemporaries; Johnson wrote his name
on the hem of her robe in Reynolds’ picture of her as the Tragic Muse,
and was struck by her “great modesty and propriety” when she called on
him. 73 Two of her brothers, one of her sisters, and two of her nieces
continued the Kemble dynasty in the theater till 1893. Through her and
Garrick the social status of actors was raised, even in an England that
made class distinctions the soul and machinery of government.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Garrick</li>
</ol>
<p>All who know of Johnson will recall that David Garrick was born
in</p>
<p>Lichfiel d (1717), attended Johnson’s school at Edial (1736), and
accom - panied him in their historic migration to London (1737)- Seven
years younger, he never won Johnson’s full friendship, for the older man
could not forgive David for being an actor and rich.</p>
<p>On reaching London Garrick joined his brother in importing and
selling wine. This involved frequent visits to taverns; there he met
actors; their talk fascinated him; he followed some of them to Ipswich,
where they let him take minor parts. He learned the histrionic art so
rapidly that soon he under- took to play the lead in Richard 111 at an
unlicensed theater in Goodman’s Fields in the East End of London. He
relished that role because he was small, like the hunchback King, and
because he enjoyed dying on the stage. His performance was so well
received that he abandoned the vintner business, to the shame and
chagrin of his Lichfield relatives. But William Pitt the Elder came
backstage to compliment him, and Alexander Pope, as crippled as Richard,
said to another spectator, “That young man never had his equal, and he
will never have a rival.” 74 Here was an actor who poured all his body
and soul into the part that he played; who became Richard III in face
and voice and hands and broken frame and sly mind and evil aims; who did
not cease to act his part when others spoke, and with difficulty forgot
it when he left the stage. Soon he was the talk of theatergoing London.
Aristocracy came to see him; lords dined with h im; “there are a dozen
dukes a night at Goodman’s Fields,” wrote Thomas Gray. 75 The Garricks
of Lichfield</p>
<p>proudly claimed David as their own.</p>
<p>He tried Lear next (March 1 1 , 1742). He failed; he was too active
in his movements to portray an octogenarian, and he had not acquired the
dignity</p>
<p>742 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XXI</p>
<p>Xof a king. The failure chastened him, and proved invaluable. He gave
up the part for a while, studied the play, practiced the facial
expressions, the feeble gait, the ailing vision, the shrill and
plaintive tones of the unhappy Lear. In April he tried again. He was
transformed; the audience wept and cheered; Garrick had created another
of the roles that for almost a century would recall his name. Everybody
applauded but Johnson, who decried acting as mere pantomime, and Horace
Walpole, who thought Garrick’s expressive - ness excessive, and Gray,
who mourned the fall from classic restraint to ro- mantic emotionalism
and sentiment. Scholars complained that Garrick played not an
unadulterated Shakespeare but versions revised and bowdler- ized,
sometimes by Garrick himself; half the lines of his Richard III were
written by Colley Cibber, 76 and the last act of his Hamlet was changed
to provide a tender finale.</p>
<p>In that season 1741-42 Garrick offered eighteen roles — a feat
suggesting almost incredible powers of memory and attention. When he
performed, the theater was filled; when he was not billed it was half
empty. The licensed theaters suffered reduced attendance. By some
backstage politics the play- house in Goodman’s Fields was forced to
close. Garrick, lost without a stage, signed a contract with the Drury
Lane Theatre for 1742-43 at ^500 — a record salary for an actor.
Meanwhile he left for a spring season in Dublin. Handel had just
captured that city with his Messiah (April 13, 1742); now Garrick and
Peg Woffington conquered it with Shakespeare. When they returned to
London they set up housekeeping together, and Garrick bought a wedding
ring. But she resented his parsimony and he her extravagance. He began
to wonder what kind of wife would emerge from Peg’s miscellaneous past.
He kept the ring, and they parted ( 1 744).</p>
<p>His acting at Drury Lane marked an era in the art. He gave to each
role all the force of his energy, and constant care that every motion of
his body, every inflection of his voice, should be in character. He made
the alarm and terror of Macbeth so vivid that this, more than any other
of his roles, remained in the public memory. He replaced the declamation
of older tra- gedians with a more natural speech. He achieved a
sensitivity of facial ex- pression that varied with the slightest change
of thought or mood in the text. Years later Johnson remarked, “David
looks much older than he is, for his face has had double the business of
any other man’s; it is never at rest.” 77 And there was his versatility.
He played comic parts with almost all the care and finish that he had
given to his Macbeth or Hamlet or Lear.</p>
<p>After five seasons as an actor Garrick signed (April 9, 1747) a
contract to divide the management of Drury Lane with James Lacy: Lacy to
take charge of business affairs, Garrick to choose the plays and the
actors and direct the rehearsals. During his twenty-nine years as
manager he produced seventy-five different plays, wrote one himself (in
collaboration with George Colman), revised twenty-four of Shakespeare ’s
dramas, composed a great number of prologues, epilogues, and farces, and
wrote for the press anonymous articles promoting and praising his work.
He appreciated money, and tempered his choice of plays to the greatest
happiness of the greatest</p>

<p>THE ENGLISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>743</p>
<p>paying number. He loved applause, as actors and writers must, and he
ar- ranged parts to get most of it. His actors thought him tyrannical
and stingy, and complained that he underpaid them while he was becoming
rich. He established order and discipline among jealous and
hypersensitive individuals each of whom verged or brooded on genius.
They grumbled, but they were glad to stay, for no other company
weathered so well the winds of fortune and the tides of taste.</p>
<p>In 1749 Garrick married Eva Maria Weigel, a Viennese dancer who had
come to England as “Mile. Violette,” and had earned plaudits for her per
- formances in opera ballets. She was, and remained, a pious Catholic;
Garrick smiled at her belief in the story of St. Ursula and the eleven
thousand vir- gins, 78 but he respected her faith since she lived up to
its moral code. She did much, by her devotion, to ease the strain of an
actor- manager’s life. He lavished his wealth upon her, took her on
Continental tours, and bought for her an expensive home in Hampton
village. There, and in his London house on Adelphi Terrace, he
entertained sumptuously, and many lords and dis- tinguished foreigners
were happy to be his guests. There he romped with Fanny Burney, and
sheltered Hannah More.</p>
<p>In 1763 he gave up acting except for special occasions. “Now,” he
said, “I will sit down and read Shakespeare.” 79 In 1768 he suggested,
planned, and supervised the first Shakespeare festival at
Stratford-on-Avon. He continued to manage Drury Lane, but found the
tempers and quarrels of the actors ever harder on his aging nerves.
Early in 1776 he sold his share of the part- nership to Richard Brinsley
Sheridan, and on March 7 he announced that he would soon retire. For
three months thereafter he gave farewell perform- ances of his favorite
roles, and enjoyed such a succession of triumphs as probably no other
actor in history has ever known. His departure from the stage caused as
much talk in London as the war with America. On June 10, 1776, he closed
his theatrical career with a benefit for the Decayed Actors’ Fund.</p>
<p>He survived three years more. He died on January 20, 1779, aged
sixty- two. On February 1 his corpse was borne to Westminster Abbey by
mem- bers of Britain’s highest nobility, and was deposited in the Poets’
Corner at</p>

<p>744</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XThese, of course, were but some aspects of London, chosen to feed
the rage of unplaced youth. Three years later Johnson described London
as “a city famous for wealth and commerce and plenty, and for every
other kind of civility and politeness, but which abounds with such heaps
of filth as a savage would look on with amazement.” 81 The civic
authorities, at that time, left street cleaning to the citizen, who was
commanded to keep in neat re- pair the pavement — or earth — before his
house. In 1762 the Westminster Paving Acts arranged for municipal
cleaning of streets, collection of rub- bish, paving and repair of main
thoroughfares, and establishment of an underground sewerage system; soon
other sections of London followed suit. Elevated footpaths protected
pedestrians, and gutters drained the streets. New streets were laid out
in straight lines, houses were built more durably, and the venerable
metropolis effused a more genteel odor.</p>
<p>There was no public fire department, but insurance companies
maintained private hose brigades to limit their losses. Coal dust and
fog sometimes col- laborated to blanket the city with a pall so thick
that one could not tell friend from foe. When the sky was visible
certain streets were bright with colorful shops. On the Strand the
largest and richest stores in Europe dis- played behind their windows
the products of half the world. Not far away were a thousand shops of a
hundred crafts, and here and there were potteries, glass factories,
smithies, breweries. The noises of artisans and tradesmen, of carriages
and horses, of hawkers and street singers, contributed to the din and
sense of life. If one wished a quieter scene and cleaner air he could
saunter in St. James’s Park, or watch fascinating ladies swing their
spread ing skirts and show their silken shoes on the Mall. In the
morning one could buy fresh milk from maids who milked cows on the park
green. In the eve- ning he might prowl, like Boswell, for a fille de
joie, or wait for the night to cover a multitude of sins. Farther west
one could ride or drive in Hyde Park. And there were the great amusement
resorts: Vauxhall with its color- ful crowds, its acres of gardens and
arbored walks, and Ranelagh with its spacious tiered Rotunda, where
Mozart performed when a child of eight.</p>
<p>The poor had alehouses, the middle and upper classes had clubs, and
there were taverns for all. There was the Boar’s Head, and the Mitre,
where the Great Cham supped, and the Globe, dear to Goldsmith, and the
Devil’s Tav - ern, which had entertained famous figures from Jonson to
Johnson. There were two Turk’s Heads— one a coffee shop on the Strand,
the other a tavern</p>
<p>Near the theaters were brothels. Preachers complained that “to the
said plays and interludes great numbers of mean, idle, and disorderly
people do commonly resort, and after the performance is over from thence
they go to bawdy houses.” 82 Nearly all cla sses who could afford it
patronized prosti- tutes, and agreed in condoning the habit as
unavoidable in the current state of male development. There were some
colored courtesans who drew cus-</p>

<p>omers even from the nobility; Boswell describes Lord Pembroke as ex-
hausted after a night in “a black bawdy house.” 83</p>
<p>Slums continued. In the lower orders it was not unusual for a family
to live in one room of a tenement. The very poor lived in damp, unheated
cellars, or in garrets with leaky roofs; some slept on bunks or in
doorways or under booths. Johnson told Miss Reynolds that “as he
returned to his lodg - ings about one or two o’clock in the morning he
often saw poor children asleep on thresholds and stalls and that he used
to put pennies into their hands to buy them a breakfast.” 84 A
magistrate informed Johnson that in any week</p>
<p>The Thames and its docks were crowded with merchantmen and their
cargoes. “The whole surface of the Thames,” wrote a contemporary, “is
covered with small vessels, barges, boats, and wherries, passing to and
fro, and, below the three bridges, such a forest of masts for miles
together, that you would think all the ships of the universe we re here
assembled.” 87 Two new bridges were added in this period: Blackfriars
and Battersea. Canaletto, coming to London from Venice (1746, 1751),
painted magnificent views of city and river; prints from these vedute
enabled educated Europeans to re- alize how London had grown to be the
chief port of the Christian world.</p>
<p>Never since ancient Rome (excepting Constantinople) had history known
so vast and rich and complex a city. In St. James’s Palace the King and
Queen and their attendants, the court and its ceremonies; in the
churches fat prelates mumbling hypnotic formulas, and humble worshipers
resting from reality and begging divine aid; in Parliament House the
Lords and the Com- mons playing the game of politics with souls as their
pawns; in Mansion House the Lord Mayor and his liveried aides laying
down ordinances about chapels and brothels, and wondering how to control
the next epidemic or mob; in the barracks soldiers gaming, wenching, and
profaning the air; in the shops the tailors curving their spines,
plumbers inhaling lead, jewelers, watch- makers, cobblers, hairdressers,
vintners, hurrying to meet the demands of ladies and gentlemen; in Grub
Street or Fleet Street the hack writers puffing up clients, tumbling
ministries, challenging the King; in the prisons men and women dying of
infection or graduating to greater crimes; in the tenements and cellars
the hungry, the unfortunate, and the defeated multiplying their like
eagerly and forever.</p>
<p>With all this both Johnson and his biographer loved London. Boswell
ad- mired “the liberty and the whims… and curious characters, the
immense crowd and hurry and bustle of business and diversion, the great
number of public places of entertainment, the noble churches and the
superb buildings,… the satisfaction of pursuing whatever plan is most
agreeable without being known or looked at” 88 — the protective, erosive
anonymity of the crowd. And Johnson, relishing and deepening “the full
flow o f London talk,” settled the matter with one authoritative line:
“When a man is tired of London he is tired of life.” 89</p>
