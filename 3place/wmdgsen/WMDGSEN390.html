<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>Milan</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>W E do injustice to the Renaissance when we concentrate our study on
Florence, Venice, and Rome. For a decade it was more brilliant in</p>
<p>Milan, under Lodovico and Leonardo, than in Florence. Its liberation
and exaltation of woman found their best embodiment in Isabella d’Este
at Mantua. It glorified Parma with Correggio, Perugia with Perugino, Or-
vieto with Signorelli. Its literature reached an apex with Ariosto at
Ferrara, and its cultivation of manners at Urbino in the days of
Castiglione. It gave name to a ceramic art at Faenza, and to the
Palladian architectural style at Vicenza. It revived Siena with
Pinturicchio and Sassetta and Sodoma, and made Naples a home and symbol
of joyous living and idyllic poetry. We must pass leisurely through the
incomparable peninsula from Piedmont to Sicily, and let the varied
voices of the cities merge in the polyphonic chorus of the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>The economic life of the Italian states in the fifteenth century was
as diverse as their climate, dialects, and costumes. The north — i.e.,
above Flor- ence — could have severe winters, sometimes freezing the Po
from end to end; yet the coastal region around Genoa, sheltered by the
Ligurian Alps, enjoyed mild weather in almost every month. Venice could
shroud its palaces and towers and liquid streets in clouds and mist;
Rome was sunny but miasmic; Naples was a climatic paradise. Everywhere,
at one time or another, the cities and their countryside suffered those
earthquakes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, famines, plagues, and wars
that a Malthusian Nature sedulously provides to compensate for the
reproductive ecstasies of man- kind. In the town? the old handicrafts
supplied the poor with a living and the rich with superfluities. Only
the textile industry had reached the fac- tory and capitalist stage; one
silk mill at Bologna contracted with the city authorities to do “the
work of 4000 spinning women.” 1 Petty tradesmen, merchants of import and
export, teachers, lawyers, physicians, administra- tors, politicians,
made up a complex middle class; a wealthy and worldly clergy added their
color and grace to the courts and the streets; and monks and friars,
somber or jovial, wandered about seeking alms or romance. The</p>
<p>l Ti</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>*74</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>aristocracy of landowners and financiers lived for the most part
within the city walls, occasionally in rural villas. At the top a
banker, condottiere, marquis, duke, doge, or king, with his wife or
mistress, presided over a court hampered with luxuries and gilded with
art. In the countryside the peasant tilled his modest acres or some
lord’s domain, and lived in a poverty</p>
<p>Slavery existed on a minor scale, chiefly in domestic service among
the rich; occasionally as a supplement and corrective to free labor on
large estates, especially in Sicily; but here and there even in northern
Italy. 2 From the fourteenth century onward the slave trade grew;
Venetian and Genoese merchants imported them from the Balkans, southern
Russia, and Islam; male or female Moorish slaves were considered a
shining ornament of Italian courts. 3 In 1488 Pope Innocent VIII
received a hundred Moorish slaves as a present from Ferdinand the
Catholic, and distributed them as gratuities among his cardinals and
other friends. 4 In 1501, after the capture of Capua, many Capuan women
were sold as slaves in Rome. 5 But these stray facts illustrate the
morals rather than the economy of the Renaissance; slavery rarely played
a significant role in the production or transport of goods.</p>
<p>Transport was chiefly on muleback or by cart, or by river, canal, or
sea. The well-to-do traveled on horseback or in horse-drawn carriages.
Speed was moderate but exciting; it took two days and a good spine to
ride from Perugia to Urbino — sixty-four miles; a boat might take
fourteen days from Barcelona to Genoa. Inns were numerous, noisy, dirty,
and uncomfortable. One at Padua could house 200 guests and stable 200
horses. Roads were rough and perilous. The main streets of the cities
were paved with flag- stones, but were only exceptionally lighted at
night. Good water was brought in from the mountains, rarely to
individual homes, usually to pub- lic fountains artistically designed,
by whose cooling flow simple women and idle men gathered and distributed
the news of the day.</p>
<p>The city-states that divided the peninsula were ruled in some cases —
Florence, Siena, Venice — by mercantile oligarchies; more often b y “des
- pots” of diverse degree, who had superseded republican or communal
institutions vitiated by class exploitation and political violence. Out
of the competition of strong men one emerged — almost always of humble
birth — who subdued and destroyed or hired the rest, made himself
absolute ruler, and in some cases transmitted his power to his heir. So
the Visconti or Sforzas ruled in Milan, the Scaligeri in Verona, the
Carraresi in Padua, the Gonzagas in Mantua, the Estensi in Ferrara. Such
men enjoyed a precari-</p>

<p>ous popularity because they laid a lid upon faction, and made life
and property safe within their whim and the city’s walls. The lower
classes accepted them as a last refuge from the dictatorship of ducats;
the sur- rounding peasantry reconciled itself to them because the
commune had given it neither protection nor justice nor freedom.</p>
<p>The despots were cruel because they were insecure. With no tradition
of legitimacy to support them, subject at any moment to assassination or
revolt, they surrounded themselves with guards, ate and drank in fear of
poison, and hoped for a natural death. In their earlier decades they
gov- erned by craft, corruption, and quiet murder, and practised all the
arts of Machiavelli before he was born; after 1450 they felt more secure
through sanctification by time, and contented themselves with pacific
means in domestic government. They suppressed criticism and dissent, and
main- tained a horde of spies. They lived luxuriously, and affected an
impressive pomp. Nevertheless they earned the tolerance and respect,
even, in Ferrara and Urbino, the devotion, of their subjects, by
improving administration, executing impartial justice where their own
interests were not involved, helping the people in famine and other
emergencies, relieving unemploy- ment with public works, building
churches and monasteries, beautifying their cities with art, and
supporting scholars, poets, and artists who might polish their
diplomacy, brighten their aura, and perpetuate their name. They waged
frequent but usually petty war, seeking the mirage of se- curity through
the advancement of their frontiers, and having an expansive appetite for
taxable terrain. They did not send their own people to war, for then
they would have had to arm them, which might be suicidal; instead they
hired mercenaries, and paid them with the proceeds of conquests,
ransoms, confiscations, and pillage. Dashing adventurers came down over
the Alps, often with bands of hungry soldiers in their train, and sold
their services as condottieri to the highest bidder, changing sides with
the fluc- tuations of the fee. A tailor from Essex, known in England as
Sir John Hawkwood and in Italy as Acuto, fought with strategic subtlety
and tacti- cal skill against and for Florence, amassed several hundred
thousand florins, died as a gentleman farmer in 1 394, and was buried
with honors and art in Santa Maria del Fiore.</p>
<p>The despot financed education as well as war, built schools and
libraries, supported academies and universities. Every town in Italy had
a school, usually provided by the Church; every major city had a
university. Under the schooling of humanists, universities, and courts,
public taste and man- ners improved, every second Italian became a judge
of art, every important</p>

<p>center had its own artists and its own architectural style. The joy
of life spread, for the educated classes, from one end of Italy to the
other; manners were relatively refined, and yet instincts were
unprecedentedly free. Never since the days of Augustus had genius found
such an audience, such stimu- lating competition, and such liberty.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PIEDMONT AND LIGURIA</li>
</ol>
<p>In northwestern Italy and what is now southeastern France lay the
prin- cipality of Savoy-Piedmont, whose ruling house was till 1945 the
oldest royal family in Europe. Founded by Count Humbert I as a
dependency of the Holy Roman Empire, the proud little state expanded to
a moment of g lory under the “Green Count” Amadeus VI (1343 -83), who
annexed Geneva, Lausanne, Aosta, and Turin, which he made his capital.
No other ruler of his time enjoyed so fair a reputation for wisdom,
justice, and gen- erosity. The Emperor Sigismund raised the counts to
dukes (1416), but the first duke, Amadeus VIII, lost his head when he
accepted nomination as Antipope Felix V (1439). A century later Savoy
was conquered by Fran- cis I for France (1536). Savoy and Piedmont
became a battleground be- tween France and Italy; Apollo surrendered
them to Mars; they remained in the backwater of the Italian torrent, and
never felt the full flow of the Renaissance. In the rich Turin Gallery,
and in his native Vercelli, are the pleasant but mediocre paintings of
Defendente Ferrari.</p>
<p>South of Piedmont, Liguria embraces all the glory of the Italian
Riviera: on the east the Riviera di Levante, or Coast of the Rising
(Sun) ; on the west the Riviera di Ponente, or Coast of the Setting; and
at their junction Genoa, almost as resplendent as Naples on a throne of
hills and a spreading pedestal of blue sea. To Petrarch it had seemed “a
city of Kings, the very temple of prosperity, the gate of joy”; 6 but
that was before the Genoese debacle at Chioggia (1378). While Venice
recovered rapidly through the orderly and devoted co-operation of all
classes in restoring commerce and solvency, Genoa continued its
tradition of civil strife between noble and noble, nobles and commoners.
Oligarchic oppression provoked a minor revolution (1383); the butchers,
armed with the persuasive cutlery of their trade, led a crowd to the
palace of the doge, and compelled a reduction of taxes and the exclusion
of nobles from the government. In five years (1390-4) Genoa had ten
revolutions, ten doges rose and fell; finally order</p>
<p>emed more precious than freedom, and the harassed republic, fearing
absorption by Milan, gave itself over, with its Rivieras, to France
(1396).</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>Two years later the French were expelled in a passionate revolt; five
bloody battles were fought in the streets; twenty palaces were burned,
government buildings were sacked and demolished, property to the value
of a million florins was destroyed. Genoa again found the chaos of
freedom unbear- able, and surrendered itself to Milan (1421). The
Milanese rule became intolerable, revolution restored the republic
(1435), and the strife of fac- tions was resumed.</p>
<p>The one element of stability amid these fluctuations was the Bank of
St. George. During the war with Venice the government had borrowed money
from its citizens, and had given them promissory notes. After the war it
was unable to redeem these pledges, but it turned over to the lenders
the customs dues of the port. The creditors organized themselves into
the Casa di San Giorgio, the House of St. George, chose a directorate of
eight governors, and received from the state a palace for their use. The
House or Company was well managed, being the least corrupt institution
in the republic. It was entrusted with the collection of taxes; it lent
some of its funds to the government, and received in return substantial
properties in Liguria, Corsica, the eastern Mediterranean, and the Black
Sea. It became both the state treasury and a private bank, accepting
deposits, discounting notes, making loans to commerce and industry. As
all factions were finan- cially tied to it, all respected it, and left
it unharmed in revolution and war. Its magnificent Renaissance palace
still stands in the Piazza Caricamento.</p>
<p>The fall of Constantinople was an almost fatal blow to Genoa. The
rich Genoese settlement at Pera, near Constantinople, was taken over by
the Turks. When the impoverished republic once more submitted to France
(1458), Francesco Sforza financed a revolution that expelled the French
and made Genoa again a dependency of Milan (1464) . The confusion that
weakened Milan after the assassination of Galeazzo Maria Sforza (1476)
allowed the Genoese a brief interlude of freedom; but when Louis XII
seized Milan (1499), Genoa too succumbed to his power. At last, in the
long conflict between Francis I and Charles V, a Genoese admiral, Andrea
Doria, turned his ships against the French, drove them out of Genoa, and
established a new republican constitution (1528). Like the governments
of Florence and Venice, it was a commercial oligarchy; only those
families were enfranchised whose names were inscribed in il libro d’oro
( The Golden Book). The new regime — a senate of 400, a council of 200,
a doge elected for two years — brought a disciplined peace to the
factions, and maintained the independence of Genoa till the coming of
Napoleon ( 1 797 ) -</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>I?8</p>
<p>(chap. VI</p>
<p>Amid this passionate disorder the city contributed far less than her
due share to Italian letters, science, and art. Her captains explored
the seas avidly, but when her son Columbus appeared among them Genoa was
too timid or too poor to finance his dream. The nobles were absorbed in
poli- tics, the merchants in gain; neither class spared much for the
adventures of the mind. The old cathedral of San Lorenzo was remodeled
in Gothic (1307) with a majestic interior; its chapel of San Giovanni
Battista (145 if) was adorned with a handsome altar and canopy by Matteo
Civitali and a somber statue of the Baptist by Iacopo Sansovino. Andrea
Doria effected almost as significant a revolution in Genoese art as in
government. He brought Fra Giovanni da Montorsoli from Florence to
remodel the Palazzo Doria (1529), and Perino del Vaga from Rome to adorn
it with frescoes and stucco reliefs, grotesques, and arabesques; the
result was one of the most ornate residences in Italy. Leone Leoni,
rival and foe of Cellini, came from Rome to cast a fine medallion of the
admiral, and Montorsoli designed his tomb. In Genoa the Renaissance did
not long antedate Doria, and did not long survive his death.</p>
<p>in. PAVIA</p>
<p>Between Genoa and Milan the ancient city of Pavia lay quietly along
the Ticino. Once it had been the seat of the Lombard kings; now, in the
four- teenth century, it was subject to Milan, and was used by the
Visconti and the Sforzas as a second capital. There Galeazzo Visconti II
began (1360), and Gian (i.e., Giovanni, John) Galeazzo Visconti
completed, the majestic Castello that served as a ducal residence for
its second founder, and as a pleasure palace for later dukes of Milan.
Petrarch called it “the noblest product of modem art,” and many
contemporaries ranked it first among the royal dwellings of Europe. The
library contained one of the most precious collections of books in
Europe, including 95 1 illuminated manu- scripts. Louis XII, having
taken Milan in 1499, carried off this Pavia library among his spoils;
and a French army destroyed the interior of the castle with the latest
artillery (1527). Nothing remains but the walls.</p>
<p>Though the Castello is ruined, the finest jewel of the Visconti and
the Sforzas survives intact — the Certosa, or Carthusian monastery,
hidden off the highway between Pavia and Milan. Here, in a placid plain,
Gian- galeazzo Visconti undertook to build cells, cloisters, and a
church in ful- fillment of a vow made by his wife. From that beginning
until 1499 the dukes of Milan continued to develop and embellish the
edifice as the favor-</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>*79</p>
<p>ite embodiment of their piety and their art. There is nothing more
exquisite in Italy. The Lombard-Romanesque fagade of white Carrara
marble was designed, carved, and erected (1473^ by Cristoforo Mantegazza
and Gio- vanni Antonio Amadeo of Pavia sponsored by Galeazzo Maria
Sforza and Lodovico il Moro. It is too ornate, too fondly gifted with
arches, statues, reliefs, medallions, columns, pilasters, capitals,
arabesques, carved angels, saints, sirens, princes, fruits, and flowers
to convey a sense of unity and harmony; each part importunes attention
regardless of the whole. But each part is a labor of love and skill; the
four Renaissance windows by Amadeo would of themselves entitle him to
the remembrance of mankind. In some Italian churches the fagade is a
brave front on an otherwise un- distinguished exterior; but in this
Certosa di Pavia every external feature and aspect is arrestingly
beautiful: the stately attached buttresses, the noble towers, arcades,
and spires of the north transept and the apse, the graceful columns and
arches of the cloisters. Within the court the eye rises from these
slender columns through three successive stories of arcades to the four
superimposed colonnades of the cupola; this is an ensemble harmoniously
conceived and admirably wrought. Within the church everything is of
unsurpassed excellence: columns rising in clusters and Gothic arches to
carved and coffered vaults; bronze and iron grilles as delicately
designed as royal lace; doors and archways of elegant form and ornament;
altars of marble studded with precious stones; paintings by Perugino,
Borgognone, and Luini; the magnificent inlaid choir stalls; the luminous
stained glass; the careful carving of pillars, spandrels, archivolts,
and cornices; the stately tomb of Giangaleazzo Visconti by Cristoforo
Romano and Benedetto Briosco; and, as the last relic of a pathetic
romance, the tomb and figures of Lodovico il Moro and Beatrice d’Este,
here united in exq uisite marble, though they died ten years and five
hundred miles apart. In a like union of diverse moods the Lombard,
Gothic, and Renaissance styles are here wedded in the most nearly
perfect architectural product of the Renais- sance. For under Lodovico
the Moor Milan had gathered fair women to create an unrivaled court, and
supreme artists like Bramante, Leonardo, and Caradosso to snatch the
leadership of Italy, for one bright decade, from Florence, Venice and
Rome.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE VISCONTI: 1378-1447</li>
</ol>
<p>Galeazzo II, dying in 1378, bequeathed his share of the Milanese
realm to his son Giangaleazzo Visconti, who continued to use Pavia as a
capital.</p>
<p>l8o THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Here was a man who would have warmed Machiavelli’s heart. Immersed in
the great library of his palace, taking care of a delicate constitution,
win- ning his subjects by moderate taxation, attending church with
impressive piety, filling his court with priests and monks, he was the
last prince in Italy whom diplomats would have suspected of planning to
unite the entire pen- insula under his rule. Yet this was the ambition
that seethed in his brain; he pursued it to the end of his life, and
almost realized it; and in its service he used craft, treachery, and
murder as if he had studied the unwritten Prince with reverence, and had
never heard of Christ.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his uncle Bernabo was ruling the other half of the Visconti
realm from Milan. Bernabo was a candid villain; he taxed his subjects to
the edge of endurance, compelled the peasantry to keep and feed the five
thousand hounds that he used in the chase, and stilled resentment by an-
nouncing that criminals would be tortured for forty days. He laughed at
Giangaleazzo’s piety, and schemed how to dispose of him and ma ke
himself master of all the Visconti heritage. Gian, equipped with the
spies necessary to any competent government, learned of these plans. He
arranged a meet- ing with Bernabo, who came conveniently with two sons;
Gian’s secret guard arrested all three, and apparently poisoned Bernabo
(1385). Gian now ruled Milan, Novara, Pavia, Piacenza, Parma, Cremona,
and Brescia. In 1387 he took Verona, in 1389 Padua; in 1399 he shocked
Florence by buying Pisa for 200,000 florins; in 1400 Perugia, Assisi,
and Siena, in 1401 Lucca and Bologna, submitted to his generals; and
Gian was master of nearly all north Italy from Novara to the Adriatic.
The Papal States were now weakened by the Schism (1378-1417) that had
followed the return of the papacy from Avignon. Gian played pope against
rival pope, and</p>
<p>dreamed of absorbing all the lands of the Church. Then he would send
his armies against Naples; his control of Pisa and other outlets would
force Florence into submission; Venice alone would remain unbound, but
help- less against a united Italy. However in 1402 Giangaleazzo, aged
fifty-one, died.</p>
<p>All this time he had hardly moved from Pavia or Milan. He liked
in-</p>
<p>trigue better than war, and achieved by subtlety more than his
generals won for him by arms. Nor could these political enterprises
exhaust the fertility of his mind. He issued a code of laws including
the regulation of public health and the compulsory isolation of
infectious disease. 7 He built the Castello of Pavia, and began the
Certosa di Pavia and the cathedral of Milan. He called Manuel
Chrysoloras to the chair of Greek in the Uni- versity of Milan, fostered
the University of Pavia, helped poets, artists,</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>scholars, and philosophers, and relished their company. He extended
the Naviglio Grande, or Great Canal, from Milan to Pavia, thereby
opening an inland waterway across the breadth of Italy from the Alps
through Milan and the Po to the Adriatic Sea, and providing irrigation
for thousands of acres of soil. The agriculture and commerce so promoted
encouraged industry; Milan began to rival Florence in woolen goods; her
smiths made weapons and armor for warriors throughout western Europe; in
one crisis two master armorers forged arms for six thousand soldiers in
a few days. 8 In 1314 the silk weavers of Lucca, impoverished by faction
and war, had migrated by hundreds to Milan; by 1400 the silk industry
was well devel- oped there, and moralists complained that clothing had
become shamefully beautiful. Giangaleazzo protected this flourishing
economy with wise administration, equable justice, and reliable
currency, and a tolerable taxa- tion that extended to clergy and
nobility as well as laymen and commoners. Under his prodding the postal
service was expanded; in 1425 over a hun- dred horses were regularly
employed by the post; private correspondence was accepted at post
offices, and traveled all day — in emergency, all night as well. In 1423
Florence had an annual state revenue of 4,000,000 gold florins
(00,000,000), Venice 11,000,000, Milan 12,000,000.® Kings were glad to
have their sons and daughters marry into the Visconti family. Em- peror
Wenceslas merely crowned fact with form when (1395) he gave imperial
sanction and legitimacy to Gian’s t itle of duke, and invested him and
his heirs with the duchy of Milan “forever.”</p>
<p>This proved to be fifty- two years. Gian’s oldest son, Gianmaria Vis
-</p>
<p>conti,* was thirteen when his father died (1402). The generals who
had led Gian’s victorious armies co mpeted for the regency. While they
fought for Milan, Italy resumed her fragmentation: Florence recaptured
Pisa; Venice took Verona, Vicenza, and Padua; Siena, Perugia, and
Bologna submitted to individual despots. Italy was as before, and worse,
for Gian- maria, leaving the government to oppressive regents, devoted
himself to his dogs, trained them to eat human flesh, and joyfully
watched them feed on the live men whom he had condemned as political
offenders or social crimi- nals. 10 In 1412 three nobles stabbed him to
death.</p>
<p>His brother Filippo Maria Visconti seemed to have inherited the
subtle intelligence, the patient industry, the ambitious and farseeing
policies of his father. But what had been sedentary courage in
Giangaleazzo became in Filippo sedentary timidity, a perpetual fear of
assassination, a haunting</p>

<p>belief in universal human perfidy. He shut himself up in the castle
of Porta Giovia at Milan, ate and grew fat, cherished superstitions and
astrologers, and yet by pure craft remained to the end of his long reign
the absolute master of his country, his generals, and even of his
family. He married Beatrice Tenda for her money, and condemned her to
death for infidelity. He married Maria of Savoy, kept her secluded from
all but her ladies in waiting, brooded over his lack of a son, took a
mistress, and became partly human in his affection for the pretty
daughter Bianca who was born of this liaison. He continued his father’s
patronage of learning, called noted schol - ars to the University of
Pavia, and gave commissions to Brunellesco and the incomparable medalist
Pisanello. He ruled Milan with efficient autocracy, suppressing faction,
maintaining order, protecting peasants against feudal exactions, and
merchants against brigandage. By deft diplomacy and adroit manipulation
of his armies he restored to Milanese allegiance Parma and Piacenza, all
of Lombardy to Brescia, all the lands between Milan and the Alps; and in
1421 he persuaded the Genoese that his dictatorship was milder than
their civil wars. He encouraged marriages between rival families, so
ending many feuds. For a hundred petty tyrannies he set up one; and the
population, shorn of liberty but free from internal strife, grumbled,
pros- pered, and multiplied.</p>
<p>He had a flair for finding able generals; suspected them all of
wishing to replace him; played them off against one another; and kept
war brewing in the hope of regaining all that his father had won and his
brother had lost. A breed of powerful condottieri developed in his wars
with Venice and Florence: Gattamelata, Colleoni, Carmagnola, Braccio,
Fortebraccio, Mon- tone, Piccinino, Muzio Attendolo. . . . Muzio was a
country lad, one of a large family of male and female fighters; he won
the cognomen Sforza by the strength of body and will with which he
served Queen Joanna II of Naples; he lost her favor and was thrown into
prison; his sister, in full armor, forced his jailers to set him free;
he was given command of one of the Milanese armies, but was drowned soon
afterward while crossing a stream (1424). His bastard son, then twenty-
two, leaped into his father’s place, and fought and married his way to a
throne.</p>
<p>V. THE SFORZAS: I45O-150O</p>
<p>Francesco Sforza was the ideal of Renaissance soldiers: tall,
handsome, athletic, brave; the best runner, jumper, wrestler in his
army; sleeping little, marching bareheaded winter and summer; winning
the devotion of his men</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>l8 3</p>
<p>by sharing their hardships and rations, and leading them to lucrative
vic- tories by strategy and tactics rather than by superior numbers or
arms. So unrivaled was his reputation that enemy forces, on more than
one occasion, laid down their arms at sight of him, and greeted him with
uncovered heads as the greatest general of his time. Ambitious to found
a state of his own, he allowed no scruple to hinder his policy; he
fought alternately for Milan, Florence, and Venice until Filippo won his
loyalty by giving him Bianca in marriage, with Cremona and Pontremoli as
her dowry (1441). When, six years later, Filippo died heirless, bringing
the Visconti dynasty to an end, Francesco felt that the dowry should
include Milan.</p>
<p>The Milanese thought differently; they proclaimed a republic named
Ambrosian from the masterful bishop who had chastened Theodosius and
converted Augustine a thousand years before. But the rival factions in
the city could not agree; the dependencies of Milan snatched the
opportunity to declare themselves free; some of them fell before
Venetian arms; danger was imminent of a Venetian or Florentine attack;
moreover the Duke of Orleans, the Emperor Frederick III, and King
Alfonso of Aragon all</p>
<p>claimed Milan as their own. In this crisis a deputation sought
Sforza, gave him Brescia, and begged him to defend Milan. He fought off
its enemies with resourceful energy; but when the new government made
peace with Venice without consulting him he turned his troops against
the Republic, besieged Milan to the edge of starvation, accepted its
surrender, entered the city amid the acclamations of a hungry populace,
and dulled the lust for liberty by distributing bread. A general
assembly was summoned, com- posed of one man from each household; it
invested him with the ducal authority over the protests of the Emperor,
and the Sforza dynasty began its brief and brilliant career (1450).</p>
<p>His elevation did not change his character. He continued to live
simply and to work hard. Now and then he was cruel or treacherous,
alleging the good of the state as his excuse; generally he was a man of
justice and hu- manity. He suffered from a lawless sensitivity to the
beauty of women. His accomplished wife killed his mistress, and then
forgave him; she bore him eight children, advised him wisely in
politics, and won the people to his rule by succoring the needy and
protecting the oppressed. His adminis- tration of the state was as
competent as his leadership of its armies. The social order that he
enforced brought back to the city a prosperity that dimmed the memory of
its suffering and its fitful liberty. As a citadel against revolt or
siege he began to build the enormous Castello Sforzesco. He cut new
canals through the land, organized public works, and built the</p>

<p>184</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Ospedale Maggiore, or Great Hospital. He brought the humanist Filelfo
to Milan, and encouraged education, scholarship, and art; he lured
Vincenzo Foppa from Brescia to develop a school of painting. Threatened
by the intrigues of Venice, Naples, and France, he held them all at bay
by winning the decisive support and firm friendship of Cosimo de’
Medici. He dis - armed Naples by wedding his daughter Ippolita to
Ferdinand’s son Alfonso; he checkmated the Duke of Orleans by signing an
alliance with Louis XI of France. Some nobles continued to seek his
death and his power, but the success of his government disordered their
plans, and he lived to die, in peace, the traditional death of generals
(1466).</p>
<p>Born to the purple, his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza never knew the
disci- pline of poverty and struggle. He gave himself up to pleasure,
luxury, and pomp, seduced with special relish the wives of his friends,
and punished opposition with a cruelty that seemed to have descended to
him, deviously and mysteriously, through the kindly Bianca from the hot
Visconti blood. The people of Milan, inured to absolute rule, offered no
resistance to his despotism, but private vengeance punished what public
terror brooked. Girolamo Olgiati grieved over a sister seduced and then
discarded by the Duke; Giovanni Lampugnani thought himself despoiled of
property by the same lord; together with Carlo Visconti they had been
trained by Niccolo Monteno in Roman history and ideals, including
tyrannicide from Brutus to Brutus. After imploring the help of the
saints, the three youths entered the church of St. Stephen, where
Galeazzo was worshiping, and stabbed him to death (1476). Lampugnani and
Visconti were killed on the spot. Olgiati was tortured till almost every
bone in his body was broken or tom from its socket; he was then flayed
alive; but to his last breath he refused to repent, called upon pagan
heroes and Christian saints to approve his deed, and died with a classic
and Renaissance phrase on his lips: Mors acerba, jama perpetua — “Death
is bitter, but fame is everlasting.” 11</p>
<p>Galeazzo left his throne to a seven-year-old boy, Giangaleazzo
Sforza. For three chaotic years Guelf and Ghibelline factions competed
in force and fraud to capture the regency. The victor was one of the
most colorful and complex personalities in all the crowded gallery of
the Renaissance. Lodovico Sforza was the fourth of Francesco Sforza’s
sons. His father gave him the cognomen Mauro; his contemporaries
jokingly transformed this into il Moro — l ‘ the Moor”— because of his
dark hair and eyes; he himself good-humoredly accepted the nickname, and
Moorish emblems and cos- tumes became popular at his court. Other wits
found in the name a syno- nym for the mulberry tree (in Italian, moro )
; this too became a symbol for</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>I8 5</p>
<p>him, made the mulberry color fashionable in Milan, and provided a
theme and motive for some of Leonardo’s decorations in the Castello
rooms. Lodovico’s chief teacher was the scholar Filelfo, who gave him a
rich grounding in the classics; but his mother Bianca warned the
humanist that “we have princes to educate, not merely scholars”; and she
saw to it that her sons should also be skilled in the arts of government
and war. Lodovico was seldom physically brave; but in him the
intelligence of the Visconti freed itself from their cruelty, and with
all his faults and sins, he became one of the most civilized men in
history.</p>
<p>He was not handsome; like most great men, he was spared this
distracting handicap. His face was too full, his nose too long and
curved, his chin too ample, his lips too firmly closed; and yet in the
profile attributed to Bol- traffio, in the busts in Lyons and the
Louvre, there is a quiet strength in the features, a sensitive
intelligence, an almost soft refinement. He earned the reputation of
being the craftiest diplomat of his time, sometimes vacil- lating, often
devious, not always scrupulous, occasionally unfaithful; these were the
common faults of Renaissance diplomacy; perhaps they are the hard
necessities of all diplomacy. Nevertheless few Renaissance princes
equaled him in mercy and generosity; cruelty was against his grain, and
countless men and women enjoyed his beneficence. Mild and courteous,
sensually susceptible to every beauty and every art, imaginative and
emo- tional and yet rarely losing perspective or his temper, skeptical
and super- stitious, the master of millions and the slave of his
astrologer — all this was Lodovico, the unstable culminating heir of
clashing strains.</p>
<p>For thirteen years -(1481-94) he governed Milan as regent for his
nephew. Giangaleazzo Sforza was a timid retiring spirit, dreading the
responsibilities of rule; he was subject to frequent illness, and
incapable of serious affairs — incapacissimo, Guicciardini called him;
he gave himself to amusement or idleness, and gladly left the
administration of the state to the uncle whom he admired with envy and
trusted with doubt. Lodovico resigned to him all the pomp and splendor
of the ducal title and office; it was Gian who sat on the throne,
received homage, and lived in regal luxury. But his wife, Isabella of
Aragon, resented Lodovico’s retention of power, urged Gian to take the
reins of office in his own hands, and begged her father Alfonso, heir to
the throne of Naples, to come with his army and give her the powers of
an actual ruler.</p>
<p>Lodovico governed efficiently. Around his summer cottage at Vigevano
he developed a vast experimental farm and cattle-breeding station;
experi- ments were made there in cultivating rice, the vine, and the
mulberry tree;</p>
<p>i86</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>the dairies made butter and cheese of such excellence as even Italy
had never known before; the fields and hills pastured 28,000 oxen, cows,
buffa- loes, sheep, and goats; the spacious stables sheltered the
stallions and mares that bred the finest horses in Europe. Meanwhile, in
Milan, the silk in- dustry employed twenty thousand workers, and
captured many foreign markets from Florence. Ironmongers, goldsmiths,
woodcarvers, enamelers, potters, mosaicists, glass painters, perfumers,
embroiderers, tapestry weav- ers, and makers of musical instruments
contributed to the busy din of Milanese industry, adorned the palaces
and personages of the court with ornaments, and exported sufficient
surplus to pay for the softer luxuries that came from the East. To ease
the traffic of rrien and goods, and “give the people more light and
air,” 12 Lodovico had the principal streets widened;</p>
<p>strong.</p>
<p>Milan was not convinced, but it seemed to share Lodovico’s happiness
when he brought to it as his bride the tenderest and most lovable of the
Ferrara princesses (1491). He made no pretense that he could match the
vivacious virginity of Beatrice d’Este; he was already thirty -nine, and
had served a number of mistresses, who had given him two sons and a
daughter — the gentle Bianca whom he loved as his father had loved the
passionate lady from whom she took her name. Beatrice raised no
difficulties about these usual preparations of the Renaissance male for
monogamy; but when she reac hed Milan she was shocked to find her lord’s
latest mistress, the beautiful Cecilia Gallerani, still lodged in a
Castello suite. Worse yet, Lodovico continued to visit Cecilia for two
months after his marriage; he explained to the Ferrarese ambassador that
he had not the heart to send away the cultured poetess who had so
graciously entertained his body and</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ) MILAN 1 87</p>
<p>soul. Beatrice threatened to return to Ferrara; Lodovico yielded, and
per- suaded Count Bergamini to marry Cecilia.</p>
<p>Beatrice was a girl of fourteen when she came to Lodovico. She was
not especially pretty; her charm lay in the innocent gaiety with which
she approached and appropriated life. She had grown up at Naples and
learned its joyous ways; she had left it before it could spoil her
guilelessness, but it had imparted to her a carefree extravagance which
now, in the lap of Lodovico ’s wealth, so indulged itself that Milan
caller her amantissima del lusso — madly in love with luxury . 14
Everybody forgave her, for she dif- fused such innocent merriment —
“spending day and night,” reports a con - temporary chronicler , 15 ’*in
singing and dancing and all manner of delights” — that the whole court
caught her spirit, and joy was unconfined. The grave Lodovico, some
months after their marriage, fell in love with her, and confessed for a
while that all power and wisdom were negligible things beside his new
felicity. Under his care she added graces of mind to the lure of her
youthful esprit: she learned to make Latin speeches, dizzied her head
with affairs of state, and at times served her lord well as an
irresistible am- bassadress. Her letters to her still more famous
sister, Isabella d’Este, are fragrant flowers in the Machiavellian
jungle of Renaissance strife . 18</p>
<p>With playful Beatrice to lead the dance, and hard-working Lodovico to
pay the bills, the court of Milan became now the most splendid not only
in Italy but in all Europe. The Castello Sforzesco expanded to its
fullest glory, with its majestic central tower, its endless maze of
luxurious rooms, its inlaid floors, its stained-glass windows, its
embroidered cushions and Persian car- pets, its tapestries telling again
the legends of Troy and Rome; here a ceiling by Leonardo, there a statue
by Cristoforo Solari or Cristoforo Romano, and almost everywhere some
luscious relic of Greek or Roman or Italian art. In that resplendent
setting scholars mingled with warriors, poets with philoso- phers,
artists with generals, and all with women whose natural charms were
enhanced by every refinement of cosmetics, jewelry, and dress. The men,
even the soldiers, were carefully coiffured and richly garbed.
Orchestras played a combination of musical instruments, and song filled
the halls. While Florence trembled before Savonarola and burned the
vanities of love and art, music and loose morals reigned in Lodovico’s
capital. Husbands connived at their wives’ amours in exchange for their
own excursions.” Masked balls were frequent, and a thousand gay costumes
covered a multi- tude of sins. Men and women danced and sang as if
poverty were not stalking the city walls, as if France were not planning
to invade Italy, as if Naples were not plotting the ruin of Milan.</p>
<p>1 88</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Bernardino Corio, who came from his native Como to this court, de-
scribed it with classic flourishes in his lively Historia di Milano
(c. 1500):</p>
<p>The court of our princes was splendid exceedingly, full of new</p>
<p>fashions, dresses, and delights. Nevertheless, at this time virtue
was so much lauded on every side that Minerva had set up great
rivalry</p>
<p>with Venus, and each sought to make her school the most
brilliant.</p>
<p>To that of Cupid came the most beautiful youths. Fathers yielded to
it their daughters, husbands their wives, brothers their sisters, and so
thoughtlessly did they thus flock to the amorous hall that it was</p>
<p>reckoned a stupendous thing by those who had understanding. Mi-</p>
<p>nerva, she too, sought with all her might to adorn her gentle
Acad-</p>
<p>emy. Wherefore that glorious and most illustrious Prince Lodovico</p>
<p>Sforza had called into his pay — as far as from the uttermost parts
of Europe — men most excellent in knowledge and art. Here was the</p>
<p>learning of Greece, here Latin verse and prose flourished
resplend-</p>
<p>ently, here were the poetic Muses; hither the masters of the
sculp-</p>
<p>tor’s art and those foremost in painting had gathered from
distant</p>
<p>countries, and here songs and sweet sounds of every kind and such</p>
<p>dulcet harmonies were heard, that they seemed to have descended from
Heaven itself upon this excelling court. 17a</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Beatrice who, in the fervor of maternal love, brought
disaster to Lodovico and Italy. In 1493 she bore him a son, who was
named Maximilian after his godfather, the heir apparent to the Imperial
throne. Beatrice wondered what her future, and the boy’s, would be
should Lodo - vico die. For her lord had no legal right to rule Milan;
Giangaleazzo Sforza, with Neapolitan aid, might at any moment depose,
exile, or kill him; and if Gian should manage to have a son, the duchy
would presumably descend to that son, regardless of Lodovico’s fate.
Lodovico, sympathizing with these worries, sent a secret embassy to King
Maximilian, offering him his niece, Bianca Maria Sforza, in marriage,
with a tempting dowry of 400,000 ducats (,000,000), provided that
Maximilian, on becoming emperor, would confer upon Lodovico the title
and powers of duke of Milan. Maxi- milian agreed. We should add that the
emperors, who had given the ducal title to the ruling Visconti, had
refused to sanction its assumption by the Sforzas. Legally Milan was
still subject to Imperial authority.</p>
<p>Giangaleazzo was too busy with his dogs and doctors to bother his
head with these developments, but his fuming Isabella sensed their
trend, and renewed her pleas to her father. In January, 1494, Alfonso
became King of Naples, and adopted a policy frankly hostile to the
regent of Milan.</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>Pope Alexander VI was not only allied with Naples, he was anxious to
unite the town of Forli — then ruled by a Sforza — with other cities in
a powerful papal state. Lorenzo de’ Medici, who had been friendly to
Lodo - vico, had died in 1492. Driven to desperate measures to protect
himself, Lodovico allied Milan with France, and consented to give
Charles VIII and the French army an unhindered passage through
northwestern Italy when Charles should undertake to assert his rights to
the Neapolitan throne.</p>
<p>So the French came. Lodovico played host to Charles, and bade him
Godspeed on his expedition against Naples. While the French marched
south Giangaleazzo Sforza died of a combination of ailments. Lodovico
was wrongly suspected of poisoning him, but gave some support to the
rumor by the haste with which he had himself invested with the ducal
title (1495). Meanwhile Louis, Duke of Orleans, invaded Italy with a
second French army, and announced that he would take Milan as his
rightful pos- session through his descent from Giangaleazzo Visconti.
Lodovico saw now that he had made a tragic error in welcoming Charles.
Swiftly revers- ing his policy, he helped to form, with Venice, Spain,
Alexander VI, and Maximilian, a “Holy League” to expel the French from
the peninsula. Charles hastily retraced his steps, suffered an
indecisive defeat at Fornovo (1495), and barely managed to bring his
battered army back to France. Louis of Orleans decided to wait for a
better day.</p>
<p>Lodovico prided himself on the apparent success of his tortuous
policy: he had taught Alfonso a lesson, had foiled Orleans, and had led
the League to victory. His position now seemed safe; he relaxed the
vigilance of his diplomacy, and again enjoyed the splendor of his court
and the liberties of his youth. When Beatrice became pregnant a second
time he freed her from marital obligations, and formed a liaison with
Lucrezia Crivelli</p>
<p>(1496). Beatrice bore his infidelity with impatient grief; she no
longer spread song and merriment about her, but immersed herself in her
two sons. Lodovico vacillated between his mistress and his wife,
pleading that he loved both. In 1497 Beatrice was a third time confined
in childbirth. She was delivered of a stillborn son; and half an hour
later, after great agony, she died, aged twenty-two.</p>
<p>From that moment everything changed in the city and the Duke. The
people, says a contemporary, “showed such grief as had never been known
before in Milan.” The court put on mourning; Lucrezia Crivelli fled into
obscurity; Lodovico, overcome with remorse and sorrow, passed days in
solitude and prayer; and the strong man who had hardly thought of
religion now asked for only one boon — that he might die, see Beatrice
again, earn</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>her forgiveness, and regain her love. For two weeks he refused to
receive officials, his envoys, or his children; he attended three Masses
daily, and daily visited the tomb of his wife in the church of Santa
Maria delle Grazie. He commissioned Cristoforo Solari to carve a
recumbent effigy of Beatrice; and as he wished, when dead, to be buried
with her in one tomb, he asked that his own effigy should be placed
beside hers. It was so done; and that simple monument in the Certosa di
Pavia still commemorates the brief bright day that for Lodovico and
Milan, as well as for Beatrice and Leo- nardo, had now come to an
end.</p>
<p>The tragedy ripened rapidly. In 1498 the Duke of Orleans became</p>
<p>Louis XII of France, and at once reaffirmed his intention of taking
Milan. Lodovico sought allies, but found none; Venice bluntly reminded
him of his invitation to Charles VIII. He gave command of his army to
Galeazzo di San Severino, who was too handsome for a general; Galeazzo
fled at sight of the enemy, and the French marched unhindered upon
Milan. Lodovico appointed his trusted friend Bernardino da Corte to
guard the well-fortified Castello, and bade him hold it till Lodovico
could secure aid from Maximilian. Then Lodovico, in disguise and through
a hundred vicis- situdes, made his way (September 2, 1499) to Innsbruck
and Maximilian. When Gian Trivulzio, a Milanese general whom Lodovico
had offended, led the French into Milan, Bernardino surrendered the
Castello and its treasures to him without resistance for a bribe of
150,000 ducats (,875,- 00 0). “Since Judas,” mourned Lodovico, “there
was no greater treason,” 18 and all Italy agreed with him.</p>
<p>Louis bade Trivulzio make the conquered pay for the conquest; the
gen- eral levied heavy taxes; the French soldiers behaved with coarse
insolence; t he people began to pray for Lodovico’s return. He came,
with a small force of Swiss, German, and Italian mercenaries; the French
troops retired into the Castello, and Lodovico entered Milan in triumph
(February 5,</p>
<p>1500). During his brief stay there a distinguished French prisoner
was brought to him, the Chevalier Bayard, renowned for courage and
courtesy; Lodovico restored to him his sword and horse, freed him, and
sent him back under escort to the French camp. The French did not return
the courtesy; the garrison in the Castello bombarded the streets of
Milan until Lodovico, to protect or appease the population, changed his
headquarters to Pavia. His funds began to run out, and he fell behind in
paying his troops. They proposed to compensate themselves by pillaging
the Italian towns, and fumed when he forbade them. He engaged
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, hus- band of Beatrice’s sister Isabella, to lead
his little army; Francesco agreed,</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>but secretly negotiated with the French. 18 When the French appeared
at Novara, Lodovico led his motley force to battle; it turned at the
first shock and fled; its leaders arranged terms with the French; and
when Lodovico tried to escape in disguise his Swiss mercenaries betrayed
him to the enemy (April 10, 1500). He accepted his fate quietly, merely
asking that his copy of The Divine Comedy should be brought to him from
his library in Pavia. White-haired but still proud, he was led through
hostile mocking crowds in the streets of Lyons, and was imprisoned in
the castle of Lys-Saint- Georges in Berry. Louis XII refused to see him,
and ignored the pleas of the Emperor Maximilian to set the broken
captive free, but he allowed Lodovico to stroll in the castle grounds,
to fish in the moat, and to receive friends. When Lodovico fell
seriously ill Louis sent him his own doctor, Maitre Salomon, and brought
one of Lodovico’s dwarfs from Milan to amuse him. In 1 504 he
transferred Lodovico to the chateau of Loches, and allowed him still
wider liberty. In 1508 Lodovico tried to escape; he made his way out of
the castle precincts in a load of straw; he lost himself in the woods,
was tracked by bloodhounds, and thereafter suffered a stricter
imprisonment. He was deprived of books and writing materials, and was
confined in a subterranean dungeon. There, on May 17, 1508, in a dark
solitude all the world away from the bright life of his once gay
capital, Lodovico, aged fifty-seven, died. 20</p>
<p>He had sinned against man and woman and Italy, but he had loved</p>
<p>beauty, and had cherished the men who brought art and music, poetry
and learning to Milan. Said one of Italy’s greatest historians, Girolamo
Tiraboschi, a century ago:</p>
<p>If we consider the immense number of learned men who flocked</p>
<p>to his court from all parts of Italy in the certainty of receiving
great</p>
<p>honors and rich rewards; if we recall how many famous architects</p>
<p>and painters he invited to Milan, and how many noble buildings he</p>
<p>raised; how he built and endowed the magnificent University of</p>
<p>Pavia, and opened schools of every kind of science in Milan; if
be-</p>
<p>sides all this we read the splendid eulogies and dedicatory
epistles</p>
<p>addressed to him by scholars of every nationality, we feel
inclined</p>
<p>to pronounce him the best prince that ever lived . 21</p>

<p>Lodovico and Beatrice gathered about them many poets, but life was

<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>votion that produces a masterpiece. Serafino of Aquila was short and
ugly, but his lyrics, sung by himself to the lute he played, were a
delight to Beatrice and her friends. When she died he slipped away from
Milan, unable to bear the heavy silence of rooms that had rung with her
laughter and known the lightness of her feet. Lodovico invited the
Tuscan poets Camelli and Bellincione to his court in the hope that they
would refine the rude diction of Lombardy. The result was a war of
Tuscan vs. Lombard poets, in which venomous sonnets ousted honest
poetry. Bellincione was so quarrelsome that when he died a rival wrote
an inscription for his tomb, warning the passer-by to tread quietly,
lest the corpse should rise and bite him. Therefore Lodovico made a
Lombard, Gasparo Visconti, his court poet. In 1496 Visconti presented to
Beatrice 143 sonnets, and other poems, written in letters of silver and
gold on ivory vellum, illuminated with deli- cate miniatures, and bound
in silver-gilt boards enameled with flowers. He was a real poet, but
time has withered him. He loved Petrarch, and engaged in an earnest but
friendly debate with Bramante, in verse, on the relative merits of
Petrarch and Dante, for the great architect loved to think himself a
poet as well. Such jousts of rhyme were a favorite amusement of Renais-
sance courts; almost everybody took part in them, and even generals be-
came sonneteers. The best poems written under the Sforzas were those of
a polished courtier, Niccolo da Correggio; he had come to Milan in
Beatrice’s bridal train, and had been detained there by love for her and
Lodovico; he served them as poet and diplomat, and composed his noblest
verses on Beatrice’s death. Lodovico’s mistress, Cecilia Gallerani,
herself a poetess, presided over a distinguished salon of poets,
scholars, statesmen, and philosophers. All the refinements of life and
culture that marked the eighteenth century in France flourished in
Lodovico’s Milan.</p>
<p>Lodovico did not match Lorenzo’s interest in scholarship, nor his dis
- crimination in patronage; he brought a hundred scholars to his city,
but their learned intercourse produced no outstanding native savant.
Francesco Filelfo, who made all Italy resound with his erudition and
vituperation, was born in Tolentino, studied at Padua, became a
professor there at eighteen, taught for a while at Venice, and rejoiced
at the opportunity to visit Con- stantinople as secretary to the
Venetian consulate ( 1419) . There he studied Greek under John
Chrysoloras, married John’s daughter, and ser ved for years as a minor
official at the Byzantine court. When he returned to Venice he was an
expert Hellenist; he boasted, with some truth, that no other Italian had
so thorough a knowledge of classic letters and tongues; he wrote poetry,
and delivered orations, in Greek and Latin; and Venice</p>

<p>paid him, as professor of those languages and their literature, the
unusually hig h stipend of 500 sequins ( 2,500) a year. A still fatter
fee lured him to Florence (1429), wh ere he became a scholastic lion.
“The whole city,” he assured a friend, “turns to look at me. . . . My
name is on every lip. Not only civic leaders, but women of the noblest
birth make way for me, paying me so much respect that I am ashamed of
their worship. My audience num- bers every day four hundred persons,
mostly men advanced in years, and of the dignity of senators.” 22 All
this soon ended, for Filelfo had a flair for quarreling, and alienated
the very men — Niccolo de’ Niccoli, Ambrogio Traversari, and others —
who had invited him to Florence. When Cosimo de’ Medici was imprisoned
in the Palazzo Vecchio, Filelfo urged the gov - ernment to put him to
death; when Cosimo triumphed Filelfo fled. For six years he taught at
Siena and Bologna; finally ( 1440) Filippo Maria Visconti drew him to
Milan with the unprecedented fee of 750 florins per year. There Filelfo
spent the remainder of his long and tempestuous career.</p>
<p>He was a man of awesome energy. He lectured four hours a day, in</p>
<p>Greek, Latin, or Italian, expounding the classics or Dante or
Petrarch; he delivered public orations for governmental ceremonies or
private celebra- tions; he wrote a Latin epic on Francesco Sforza, ten
“decades” of satires, ten “books” of odes, and twenty -four hundred
lines of Greek poetry. He composed ten thousand lines De seriis et iocis
(1465), which were never printed and are often unprintable. He buried
two wives, married a third, and had twenty-four children in addition to
the bastards that plagued his infidelities. Amid these labors he found
time to carry on gigantic literary wars with poets, politicians, and
humanists. Despite his handsome salary and incidental fees, he pled
intermittent poverty, and asked his patrons, in classic couplets, for
money, fo od, clothing, horses, and a cardinal’s hat. He made the
mistake of including Poggio among his targets, and found that jolly
scoundrel his master in scurrility.*</p>
<p>Even so, his learning made him the most sought-for scholar of the
age. In 1453 Pope Nicholas V, receiving him in the Vatican, gave him a
purse of 500 ducats (2,500); Alfonso I at Naples crowned him poet
laureate and knighted him; Duke Borso was his host at Ferrara, the
Marchese Lodovico Gonzaga at Mantua, the dictator Sigismondo Malatesta
at Rimini. When the death of Francesco Sforza, and the ensuing chaos,
made his position in- secure in Milan, he had no difficulty securing a
post in the University of</p>

<p>Rome. But the papal treasurer was remiss in his payments, and Filelfo
re- turned to Milan. Nevertheless he longed to end his days near Lorenzo
de’ Medici, to be one of the illustrious group that surrounded the
grandson of the man whom he had nominated for death. Lorenzo forgave
him, and offered him the chair of Greek literature in Florence. Filelfo
was so poor now that the government of Milan had to lend him money for
the trip. He managed to reach Florence, but died of dysentery a
fortnight after his arrival, aged eighty-three (1481). His career is one
of a hundred that, taken together, convey the unique aroma of the
Italian Renaissance, in which scholarship could be a passion, and
literature could be war.</p>

<li>ART</li>
</ol>
<p>Despotism was a boon to Italian art. A dozen rulers competed in
seeking architects, sculptors, and painters to adorn their capitals and
their memory; and in this rivalry they spent such sums as democracy
rarely spares to beauty, and such as would never have been available to
art had the proceeds of human labor and genius been equitably shared.
The result was, in Ren- aissance Italy, an art of courtly distinction
and aristocratic taste, but too often circumscribed, in form and theme,
to the needs of secular potentates or ecclesiastical powers. The noblest
art is that which, out of the toil and contributions of multitudes,
creates for them a common gift and glory; such were the Gothic
cathedrals and the temples of classic Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Every critic denounces the duomo of Milan as a plethora of ornament
confusing structural line; but the people of Milan have for five
centuries gathered fondly in its cool immensity, and, even in this
doubting day, cher- ish it as their collective achievement and pride.
Giangaleazzo Visconti began it (1386), and planned it on a scale
befitting the capital of the united Italy of his dreams; 40,000 people
should find room there to worship God and admire Gian. Tradition tells
how, at that time, the women of Milan were afflicted with a mysterious
disease in their pregnancies, and many of their babies died in infancy;
Gian himself mourned three sons painfully born and all soon dead; and he
dedicated the great shrine as an offering Mariae nascenti, “to Mary in
her birth,” praying that he might have an heir, and that the mothers of
Milan might bear a wholesome progeny. He sum- moned architects from
France and Germany as well as from Italy; the northerners dictated the
Gothic style, the Italians lavished ornament; har- mony of style and
form faded in a conflict of counsels and two centuries of</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>delay; the mood and taste of the world changed during the process;
and those who finished the structure no longer felt as those who had
begun it. When Giangaleazzo died (1402) only the walls had been built;
then the work marked time for lack of funds. Lodovico called in
Bramante, Leo- nardo, and others to design a cupola that should bring
the proud wilderness of pinnacles to some crowning unity; their ideas
were rejected; finally (1490) Giovanni Antonio Amadeo was drawn from his
labors on the</p>
<p>Certosa di Pavia, and was given full charge of the whole cathedral
enter- prise. He and most of his aides were rather sculptors than
architects; they could not bear that any surface should remain uncarved
or unadorned. He consumed in the task the last thirty years of his life
(1490-1522); even so the cupola was not finished till 1759; and the
facade, begun in 1616, was not completed till Napoleon made that
consummation an imperial command (1809).</p>
<p>In Lodovico’s day it was the second largest church in the world,
covering 1 20,000 square feet; today it yields the specious honor of
size to St. Peter’s</p>
<p>As the cathedral is the monument of Giangaleazzo Visconti, and the
Certosa of Pavia is the shrine of Lodovico and Beatrice, so the Ospedale
Maggiore, or Great Hospital, is the simple and stately memorial of Fran-
cesco Sforza. To design it in a manner “worthy of the ducal dominion and
of so great and illustrious a city,” Sforza brought in from Florence
(1456) Antonio Averulino, known as Filarete, who chose for it a stately
form of Lombard Romanesque. Bramante, the probable architect of the
inner court</p>

<p>or cortile, faced this with a double tier of round arches, each tier
sur- mounted by an elegant cornice. The Great Hospital remained one of
Milan’s chief glories till the Second World War left most of it in
ruins.</p>
<p>In the judgment of Lodovico and his court the supreme artist in Milan
was not Leonardo but Bramante, for Leonardo revealed only a part of him-
self to his time. Bom at Castel Durante near Urbino, Donato d’ Agnolo
began his career as a painter, and received the nickname Bramante as
mean- ing one consumed with insatiable desires. He went to Mantua to
study with Mantegna; he learned enough to paint some mediocre frescoes,
and a splen- did portrait of the mathematician Luca Pacioli. Perhaps in
Mantua he met Leon Battista Alberti, who was designing the church of
Sant’ Andrea; in any case repeated experiments in perspective led
Bramante from painting to architecture. In 1472 he was in Milan,
studying the cathedral with the intensity of a man resolved to do great
things. About 1476 he was given a chance to show his mettle by designing
the church of Santa Maria around the little church of San Satiro. In
this modest masterpiece he revealed his peculiar architectural style —
semicircular apses and sacristies, octagonal cu- polas, and circular
domes, all crowned with elegant cornices, and all crowded one upon
another in an engaging ensemble. Lacking space for an apse, Bramante,
frolicking with perspective, painted the wall behind the altar with a
pictured apse whose converging lines gave the full illusion of spatial
depth. To the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie he added an apse, a
cupola, and the handsome cloister porticoes that were another casualty
of the Second World War. After Lodovico fell Bramante went south, ready
to tear down and rebuild Rome.</p>
<p>The sculptors at Lodovico’s court were not such giants as Donatello
and Michelangelo, but they carved for the Certosa, the cathedral, and
the pal- aces a hundred figures with fascinating grace. Cristoforo
Solari the hunch- back (il Gobbo) will be remembered as long as his tomb
of Lodovico and Beatrice survives. Gian Cristoforo Romano won all hearts
by his gentle manner and beautiful singing; he was a major sculptor at
the Certosa, but after Beatrice died he yielded to a year of urging and
went to Mantua. There he carved for Isabella the pretty doorway of her
Paradiso study, and cut her likeness in one of the finest medallions of
the Renaissance. Then he moved on to Urbino to work for the Duchess
Elisabetta Gonzaga, and be- came a leading figure in Castiglione’s
Courtier. The greatest medallion carver of Milan was Cristoforo Foppa,
nicknamed Caradosso, who cut the gleaming gems that Beatrice wore, and
earned the envy of Cellini.</p>
<p>MILAN</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>There were good painters in Milan a generation before Leonardo came.
Vincenzo Foppa, bom at Brescia and formed in Padua, worked chiefly in
Mil an; his frescoes in Sant’ Eustorgio were renowned in their day, and
his Martyrdom of St. Sebastian still adorns a Castello wall. His
follower Am- brogio Borgognone has left us a more pleasing legacy:
Madonnas in the Brera and Ambrosiana galleries at Milan, in Turin, and
Berlin, all in the pure tradition of warm piety; a delectable portrait
of Giangaleazzo Sforza as a child, in the Wallace Collection in London;
and, in the church of the Incoronata at Lodi, an Annunciation which is
one of the most successful renderings of that difficult theme. Ambrogio
de Predis was court painter to Lodovico when Leonardo arrived; he seems
to have had a brush in Leo- nardo’s Virgin of the Rocks; he may have
painted the captivating angel musicians in the London National Gallery;
but his finest relics are two portraits now in the Ambrosiana: one of a
very serious young man, identity unknown;* the other of a young woman,
now generally identified with Lodovico’s natural daughter Bianca. Rarely
has an artist caught the con- flicting charms of a girl innocently
demure and yet proudly conscious of her simple beauty.</p>
<p>The cities subject to Milan suffered from the luring of their talent
to the capital, but several of them managed to earn a place in the
history of art. Como was not satisfied to be merely a Milanese gate to
the lake that gave it fame; it was proud, too, of its Torre del Comune,
its Broletto, above all of its majestic marble cathedral. The superb
Gothic fagade rose under the Sforza rule (1457-87); Bramante designed a
pretty doorway on the south side, and on the east Cristoforo Solari
built a charming apse in Bramantean style. More interesting than these
features is a pair of statues adjoining the main portal: on the left
Pliny the Elder, on the right Pliny the Younger, ancient citizens of
Como, civilized pagans finding a place on a Christian cathedral fagade
in the tolerant days of Lodovico the Moor.</p>
<p>The jewel of Bergamo was the Cappella Colleoni. The Venetian con-
dottier e, born here, desired a chapel to receive his bones, and a
sculptured cenotaph to commemorate his victories. Giovanni Antonio
Amadeo de- signed the chapel and the tomb with splendor and taste; and
Sixtus Siry of Nuremberg surmounted the sepulcher with an equestrian
statue in wood, which would have won a wider fame had not Verrocchio
cast the great captain in prouder bronze. Bergamo was too near to Milan
to keep its paint-</p>

<p>ers home; but one of them, Andrea Previtali, after studying with
Giovanni Bellini in Venice, returned to Bergamo (1513) to bequeath to it
some paint- ings of exemplary piety and modest excellence.</p>
<p>Brescia, subject at times to Venice, at times to Milan, held a
balance be- tween the two influences, and developed its own school of
art. After dis- seminating his talent among half a dozen cities,
Vincenzo Foppa returned to spend his declining years in his native
Brescia. His pupil Vincenzo Civer- chio shared with Floriano Ferramolo
the honor of forming the Brescian school. Girolamo Romani, called
Romanino, studied with Ferramolo, later in Padua and Venice; then,
making Brescia his center, he painted there, and in other towns of
northern Italy, a long series of frescoes, altarpieces, and portraits,
excellent in color, less laudable in line; let us name only the Ma-
donna and Child , in a magnificent frame by Stefano Lamberti, in the
church of San Francesco. His pupil Alessandro Bonvicino, known as</p>
<p>Moretto da Brescia, brought this dynasty to its zenith by blending
the sensuous glory of the Venetians with the warm religious sentiment
that marked Brescian painting to its end. In the church of SS. Nazaro e
Celso, where Titian placed an Annunciation , Moretto painted an equally
beautiful Coronation of the Virgin, whose archangel rivals in delicacy
of form and feature the most graceful figures of Correggio. Like Titian
he could paint, when he wished, an appetizing Venus; and his Salome,
instead of revealing a murderess by proxy, shows us one of the sweetest,
gentlest faces in the whole gamut of Renaissance art.</p>
<p>Cremona gathered her life around her twelfth-century cathedral and
its adjoining Torrazo — a campanile almost challenging Giotto’s and the
Gi - ralda. Within the duomo Giovanni de’ Sacchi— named II Pordenone
from his native town — painted his masterpiece, Jesus Carrying His
Cross. Three remarkable families contributed successive generations of
talent to Cremo- nese painting: the Bembi (Bonifazio, Benedetto, Gian
Francesco), the Boc- caccini, and the Campi. Boccaccio Boccaccini, after
studying in Venice and burning his fingers in a competition with
Michelangelo in Rome, re- turned to Cremona and won acclaim by his
frescoes of the Virgin in the Cathedral; and his son Camillo continued
his excellence. In like manner the work of Galeazzo Campi was carried on
by his sons Giulio and Antonio, and by Giulio’s pupil Berna rdino Campi.
Galeazzo designed the church of Santa Margherita in Cremona, and then
painted in it a magnificent Presenta- tion in the T emple. So the arts,
in Renaissance Italy, tended to mate in one mind, and flowered under
geniuses of such versatility as not even Periclean Greece had known.</p>
