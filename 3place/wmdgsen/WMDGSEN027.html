<p>“ Marco Millions ”</p>
<p>I N THE golden age of Venice, about the year 1295, two old men and a
man of middle age, worn with hardship, laden with bundles, dressed in
rags and covered with the dust of many roads, begged and then forced
their way into the home from which, they claimed, they had set forth
twenty-six years before. They had (they said) sailed many dangerous
seas, scaled high mountains and plateaus, crossed bandit-ridden deserts,
and passed four times through the Great Wall; they had stayed twenty
years in Cathay,* and had served the mightiest monarch in the world.
They told of an empire vaster, of cities more populous, and of a ruler
far richer, than any known to Europe; of stones that were used for
heating, of paper accepted in place of gold, and of nuts larger than a
man’s head; of nations where virginity was an impediment to marriage,
and of others where strangers were entertained by the free use of the
host’s willing daughters and wives. 1 No man would believe them; and the
people of Ven- ice gave to the youngest and most garrulous of them the
nickname “Marco Millions,” because his tale was full of numbers large
and marvelous. 5</p>
<p>Mark and his father and uncle accepted this fate with good cheer, for
they had brought back with them many precious stones from the distant
capital, and these gave them such wealth as maintained them in high
place in their city. When Venice went to war with Genoa in 1298,

name of a Mongolian tribe.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE j6l</p>
<p>Polo received command of a galley; and when his ship was captured,
and he was kept for a year in a Genoese jail, he consoled himself by
dictating to an amenuensis the most famous travel-book in literature. He
told with the charm of a simple and straightforward style how he, father
Nic- olo and uncle Maffeo had left Acre when Mark was but a boy of
seventeen; how they had climbed over the Lebanon ranges and found their
way through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf, and thence through Persia,
Khorassan and Balkh to the Plateau of Pamir; how they had joined cara-
vans that slowly marched to Kashgar and Khotan, and across the Gobi
Desert to Tangut, and through the Wall to Shangtu, where the Great Khan
received them as humble emissaries from the youthful West.* They had not
thought that they would stay in China beyond a year or two, but they
found such lucrative service and commercial opportunities under Kublai
that they remained almost a quarter of a century. Marco above all
prospered, rising even to be governor of Hangchow. In fond memory he
describes it as far ahead of any European city in the excellence of its
building and bridges, the number of its public hospitals, the ele- gance
of its villas, the profusion of facilities for pleasure and vice, the
charm and beauty of its courtesans, the effective maintenance of public
order, and the manners and refinement of its people. The city, he tells
us, was a hundred miles in circuit.</p>
<p>Its streets and canals are extensive, and of sufficient width to</p>
<p>allow of boats on the one, and carriages on the other, to pass easily
with articles necessary for the inhabitants. It is commonly said
that</p>
<p>the number of bridges, of all sizes, amounts to twelve thousand.</p>
<p>Those which are thrown over the principal canals and are connected
with the main streets, have arches so high, and built with so much</p>
<p>skill, that vessels with their masts can pass under them. At the same
time carts and horses can pass over, so well is the slope from the</p>
<p>street graded to the height of the arch. . . . There are within
the</p>
<p>city ten principal squares or market-places, besides innumerable
shops along the streets. Each side of these squares is half a mile in
length,</p>
<p>and in front of them is the main street, forty paces in width,
and</p>
<p>running in a direct line from one extremity of the city to the
other.</p>
<p>In a direction parallel to that of the main street . . . runs a
very</p>
<p>large canal, on the nearer bank of which capacious warehouses are</p>

is Coleridge’s “Xanadu.” The central Asian regions described by Polo
were not explored again by Europeans (with one forgotten exception)
until 1838.</h1>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>built of stone, for the accommodation of the merchants who arrive</p>
<p>from India and other parts with their goods and effects. They are</p>
<p>thus conveniently situated with respect to the market-places. In</p>
<p>each of these, upon three days in every week, there is an assemblage
of from forty to fifty thousand persons. . . .</p>
<p>The streets are all paved with stone and bricks. . . . The main</p>
<p>street of the city is paved … to the width of ten paces on each</p>
<p>side, the intermediate part being filled up with small gravel,
and</p>
<p>provided with arched drains for carrying off the rain-water that</p>
<p>falls into the neighboring canals, so that it remains always dry.</p>
<p>On this gravel carriages continually pass and repass. They are of
a</p>
<p>long shape, covered at the top, have curtains and cushions of
silk,</p>
<p>and are capable of holding six persons. Both men and women who</p>
<p>feel disposed to take their pleasure are in the daily practice of
hiring them for that purpose. . . .</p>
<p>There is an abundant quantity of game of all kinds. . . . From
the</p>
<p>sea, which is fifteen miles distant, there is daily brought up
the</p>
<p>river, to the city, a vast quantity of fish. … At the sight of
such</p>
<p>an importation of fish, you would think it impossible that it
could</p>
<p>be sold; and yet, in the course of a few hours, it is all taken off,
so</p>
<p>great is the number of inhabitants. . . . The streets connected
with</p>
<p>the market-squares are numerous, and in some of them are many</p>
<p>cold baths, attended by servants of both sexes. The men and women who
frequent them have from their childhood been accustomed</p>
<p>at all times to wash in cold water, which they reckon conducive</p>
<p>to health. At these bathing places, however, they have apartments</p>
<p>provided with warm water, for the use of strangers, who cannot</p>
<p>bear the shock of the cold. All are in the daily practice of
wash-</p>
<p>ing their persons, and especially before their meals. . . .</p>
<p>In other streets are the quarters of the courtesans, who are here</p>
<p>in such numbers as I dare not venture to report, . . . adorned
with</p>
<p>much finery, highly perfumed, occupying well-furnished houses,</p>
<p>and attended by many female domestics. … In other streets are</p>
<p>the dwellings of the physicians and ^he astrologers. . . . On
each</p>
<p>side of the principal street there are houses and mansions of
great</p>
<p>size. . . . The men as well as the women have fair complexions,</p>
<p>and are handsome. The greater part of them are always clothed in</p>
<p>silk. . . . The women have much beauty, and are brought up with</p>
<p>delicate and languid habits. The costliness of their dresses, in
silks</p>
<p>and jewelry, can scarcely be imagined.®</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 7^3</p>
<p>Peking (or, as it was then called, Cambaluc) impressed Polo even more
than Hangchow; his millions fail him in describing its wealth and
popula- tion. The twelve suburbs were yet more beautiful than the city;
for there the business class had built many handsome homes . 4 In the
city proper there were numerous hotels, and thousands of shops and
booths. Food of all kinds abounded, and every day a thousand loads of
raw silk entered the gates to be turned into clothing for the
inhabitants. Though the Khan had residences at Hangchow, Shangtu and
other places, the most extensive of his palaces was at Peking. A marble
wall surrounded it, and marble steps led up to it; the main building was
so large that “dinners could be served there to great multitudes of
people.” Marco admired the arrange - ment of the chambers, the delicate
and transparent glazing of the windows, and the variety of colored tiles
in the roof. He had never seen so opulent a city, or so magnificent a
king . 5</p>
<p>Doubtless the young Venetian learned to speak and read Chinese; and
perhaps he learned from the official historians how Kublai and his
Mongol ancestors had conquered China. The gradual drying up of the
regions along the northwestern frontier into a desert land incapable of
supporting its hardy population had sent the Mongols (i.e., “the brave”)
out on des - perate raids to win new fields; and their success had left
them with such a taste and aptitude for war that they never stopped
until nearly all Asia, and parts of Europe, had fallen before their
arms. Story had it that their fiery leader, Genghis Khan, had been born
with a clot of blood in the palm of his hand. From the age of thirteen
he began to weld the Mongol tribes into one, and terror was his
instrument. He had prisoners nailed to a wooden ass, or chopped to
pieces, or boiled in cauldrons, or flayed alive. When he received a
letter from the Chinese Emperor Ning Tsung demanding his submission, he
spat in the direction of tbe Dragon Throne and began at once his march
across twelve hundred miles of the Gobi desert into the western
provinces of China. Ninety Chinese cities were so completely destroyed
that horsemen could ride over the devastated areas in the dark without
stumbling. For five years the “Emperor of Man - kind” laid north China
waste. Then, frightened by an unfavorable con - junction of planets, he
turned back towards his native village, and died of illness on the way .
0</p>
<p>His successors, Ogodai, Mangu and Kublai, continued the campaign</p>
<p>with barbaric energy; and the Chinese, who had for centuries given
them-</p>
<p>7&lt; THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>selves to culture and neglected the arts of war, died with individual
heroism and national ignominy. At Juining-fu a local Chinese ruler held
out until all the aged and infirm had been killed and eaten by the
beseiged, all the able-bodied men had fallen, and only women remained to
guard the walls; then he set fire to the city and burned himself alive
in his palace. The armies of Kublai swept down through China until they
stood before the last retreat of the Sung Dynasty, Canton. Unable to
resist, the Chinese general, Lu Hsiu-fu, took the boy emperor on his
back, and leaped to a double death with him in the sea; and it is said
that a hundred thousand Chinese drowned themselves rather than yield to
the Mongol conqueror. Kublai gave the imperial corpse an honorable
burial, and set himself to establish that Yuan (“Original”) or Mongol
Dyn asty which was to rule China for less than a hundred years.</p>
<p>Kublai himself was no barbarian. The chief exception to this
statement was not his treacherous diplomacy, which was in the manner of
his time, but his treatment of the patriot and scholar, We n T’ien
-hsian, who, out of loyalty to the Sung Dynasty, refused to acknowledge
Kublai’s rule. He was imprisoned for three years, but would not yield.
“My dungeon,” he wrote, in one of the most famous passages in Chinese
literature,</p>
<p>is lighted by the will- o’ -the-wisp alone; no breath of spring
cheers</p>
<p>the murky solitude in which I dwell. . . . Exposed to mist and
dew,</p>
<p>I had many times thought to die; and yet, through the seasons of</p>
<p>two revolving years, disease hovered around me in vain. The dank,</p>
<p>unhealthy soil to me became paradise itself. For there was that</p>
<p>within me which misfortune could not steal away. And so I re-</p>
<p>mained firm, gazing at the white clouds floating over my head,
and</p>
<p>bearing in my heart a sorrow boundless as the sky.</p>
<p>At length Kublai summoned him into the imperial presence. “What is it
that you want?” asked the monarch. “By the grace of the Sung Emperor,”
answered Wen, “I became his Majesty’s minister. I cannot serve two
masters. I only ask to die.” Kublai consented; and as Wen awaited the
sword of the executioner upon his neck he made obeisance toward the
south, as though the Sung emperor were still reigning in the southern
capital, Nanking . 7</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kublai had the grace to recognize the civilized
superiority of the Chinese, and to merge the customs of his own people
into theirs.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 7 65</p>
<p>Of necessity he abandoned the system of examinations for public
office, since that system would have given him a completely Chinese
bureau- cracy; he restricted most higher offices to his Mongol
followers, and tried for a time to introduce the Mongol alphabet. But
for the greater part he and his people accepted the culture of China,
and were soon trans- formed by it into Chinese. He tolerated the various
religions philoso- phically, and flirted with Christianity as an
instrument of pacification and rule. He reconstructed the Grand Canal
between Tientsin and Hang- chow, improved the highways, and provided a
rapid postal service through- out a domain larger than any that has
accepted the government of China since his day. He built great public
granaries to store the surplus of good crops for public distribution in
famine years, and remitted taxes to all peasants who had suffered from
drought, storms, or insect depredations;* he organized a system of state
care for aged scholars, orphans and the infirm; and he patronized
munificently education, letters and the arts. Under him the calendar was
revised, and the Imperial Academy was opened . 9 At Peking he reared a
new capital, whose splendor and popula- tion were the marvel of visitors
from other lands. Great palaces were built, and architecture flourished
as never in China before.</p>
<p>“Now when all this happened,” says Marco Polo, “ Messer Polo was</p>
<p>on the spot .” 10 He became fairly intimate with the Khan, and
describes his amusements in fond detail. Besides four wives called
empresses, the Khan had many concubines, recruited from Ungut in Tatary,
whose</p>
<p>ladies seemed especially fair to the royal eye. Every second year,
says Marco, officers of proved discrimination were sent to this region
to enlist for his Majesty’s service a hundred young women, according to
specifica - tions carefully laid down by the king.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival in his presence, he causes a new examination
to</p>
<p>be made by a different set of inspectors, and from amongst them a</p>
<p>further selection takes place, when thirty or forty are retained
for</p>
<p>his own chamber. . . . These are committed separately to the care</p>
<p>of certain elderly ladies of the palace, whose duty it is to
observe</p>
<p>them attentively, during the course of the night, in order to
ascer-</p>
<p>tain that they have not any concealed imperfections, that they
sleep</p>
<ul>
<li>“Not a day passes,” writes Marco Polo, “in wh ich there are not
distributed, by the regular officers, twenty thousand vessels of rice,
millet, and panicum. By reason of this admirable and astonishing
liberality which the Great Khan exercises towards the poor, the people
all adore him.” 8</li>

<p>tranquilly, do not snore, have sweet breath, and are free from</p>
<p>unpleasant scent in any part of the body. Having undergone this</p>
<p>rigorous scrutiny, they are divided into parties of five, each
taking</p>
<p>turn for thre e days and three nights in his Majesty’s interior apart
-</p>
<p>ment, where they are to perform every service that is required of</p>
<p>them, and he does with them as he likes. When this term is com-</p>
<p>pleted they are relieved by another party, in this manner suc-</p>
<p>cessively, until the whole number have taken their turn; when the</p>
<p>first five recommence their attendance . 11</p>
<p>After remaining in China for twenty years, Marco Polo, with his
father and his uncle, took advantage of an embassy sent by the Khan to
Persia, to return to their native city with a minimum of danger and
expense. Kublai gave them a message to the Pope, and fitted them out
with every comfort then known to travelers. The voyage around the Malay
Penin- sula to India and Persia, the overland journey to Trebizond on
the Black Sea, and the final voyage to Venice, took them three years;
and when they reached Europe they learned that both the Khan and the
Pope were dead.* Marco himself, with characteristic obstinacy, lived to
the age of seventy. On his deathbed his friends pleaded with him, for
the salvation of his soul, to retract the obviously dishonest statements
that he had made in his book; but he answered, stoutly: “I have not told
half of what I saw.” Soon after his death a new comic figure became
popular at the Venetian carnivals. He was dressed like a clown, and
amused the populace by his gross exaggerations. His name was Marco
Millions. 1 ”</p>

<p>Not for four centuries was China to know again so brilliant an age.
The Yuan Dynasty quickly declined, for it was weakened by the collapse
of the Mongol power in Europe and western Asia, and by the sinification
(if so pedantic a convenience may be permitted for so repeated a
phenome- non) of the Mongols in China itself. Only in an era of

<p>deserts and seas, be held permanently under one rule. The Mongols
proved better warriors than administrators, and the successors of Kublai
were forced to restore the examination system and to utilize Chinese
capacity in government. The conquest produced in the end little change
in native customs or ideas, except that it introduced, perhaps, such new
forms as the novel and the drama into Chinese literature. Once more the
Chinese married their conquerors, civilized them, and overthrew them. In
1368 an ex-Buddhist priest led a revolt, entered Peking in triumph, and
proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Ming (“Brilliant”) Dy -
nasty. In the next generation an able monarch came to the throne, and
under Yung Lo China again enjoyed prosperity and contributed to the
arts. Nevertheless, the Brilliant Dynasty ended in a chaos of rebellion
and invasion; at the very time when the country was divided into hostile
fac- tions, a new horde of conquerors poured through the Great Wall and
laid seige to Peking.</p>
<p>The Manchus were a Tungusic people who had lived for many cen-</p>
<p>turies in what is now Manchukuo (i.e., the Kingdom of the Manchus).
Having extended their power northward to the Amur River, they turned
back southward, and marched upon the Chinese capital. The last Ming
emperor gathered his family about him, drank a toast to them, bade his
wife kill herself,* and then hanged himself with his girdle after
writing his last edict upon the lapel of his robe: “We, poor in virtue
and of con - temptible personality, have incurred the wrath of God on
high. My</p>
<p>ministers have deceived me. I am ashamed to meet my ancestors. There-
fore I myself take off my crown, and with my hair covering my face</p>
<p>await dismemberment at the hands of the rebels. Do not hurt a single
one of my people.” 15 The Manchus buried him with honor, and established
the Ch’ing (“Unsullied”) Dynasty that w as to rule China until our own
revolutionary age.</p>
<p>They, too, soon became Chinese, and the second ruler of the Dynasty,
K’ang -hsi, gave China the most prosperous, peaceful and enlightened
reign in the nation’s history. Mounting the throne at the age of seven,
K’ang -hsi took personal control, at the age of thirteen, of an empire
that included not only China proper but Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea,
Indo-China, Annam, Tibet and Turkestan; it was without doubt the</p>
<p>largest, richest and most populous empire of its time. K’ang -hsi
ruled it</p>

at the same time labored to make himself acquainted with the learning
and arts of his time. He traveled throughout his realm, corrected abuses
wherever he saw them, and reformed the penal code. He lived frugally,
cut down the expenses of administration, and took pride in the welfare
of the people. 18 Under his generous patronage and discriminating
apprecia- tion literature and scholarship flourished, and the art of
porcelain reached one of the peaks of its career. He tolerated all the
religions, studied Latin under the Jesuits, and put up patiently with
the strange practices of European merchants in his ports. When he died,
after a long and benefi- cent reign (i66i- i722),he left these as his
parting words: “There is cause for apprehension lest, in the centuries
or millenniums to come, China may be endangered by collisions with the
various nations of the West who come hither f rom beyond the seas.”
17</p>
<p>These problems, arising out of the increasing commerce and contacts
of China with Europe came to the front again under another able</p>
<p>emperor of the Manchu line — Ch’ien Lung. Ch’ien Lung wrote 34,000
poems; one of them, on “Tea,” came to the attention of Voltaire, who
sent his “compliments to the charming king of China.” 18 French mis -
sionaries painted his portrait, and inscribed under it these indifferent
verses:</p>
<p>Occupe sans relache d tous les soins divers</p>
<p>D’un gouvernement qu’on admire,</p>
<p>Le plus grand potentat qui soit dans I’univers</p>
<p>Est le Meilleur lettre qui soit dans son Empire.*</p>
<p>He ruled China for two generations (1736-96), abdicated in his
eighty- fifth year, and continued to dominate the government until his
death (1799). During the last years of his reign an incident occurred
which might have led the thoughtful to recall the forebodings of K’ang
-hsi. England, which had aroused the Emperor’s anger by importing opium
into China, sent, in 1792, a commission under Lord Macartney to negoti-
ate a commercial treaty with Ch’ien Lung. The commissioners
explained</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 769</p>
<p>to him the advantages of trading with England, and added that the
treaty which they sought would take for granted the equality of the
British ruler with the Chinese emperor. Ch’ien Lung dictated this reply
to George III:</p>
<p>I set no value on objects strange and ingenious, and have no use</p>
<p>for your country’s manufactures. This, then, is my answer to your</p>
<p>request to appoint a representative at my court, a request
contrary</p>
<p>to our dynastic usage, which could only result in inconvenience
to</p>
<p>yourself. I have expounded my views in detail and have commanded your
tribute envoys to leave in peace on their homeward journeys.</p>
<p>It behooves you, O King, to respect my sentiments and to display</p>
<p>even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by
perpetual</p>
<p>submission to our throne, you may secure peace and prosperity for</p>
<p>your country hereafter. 19</p>
<p>In these proud words China tried to stave off the Industrial
Revolution. We shall see in the sequel how, nevertheless, that
Revolution came. Mean- while let us study the economic, political and
moral elements of the unique and instructive civilization which that
Revolution seems destined to destroy.</p>

<p>The first element in the picture is number: there are many
Chinese.</p>
<p>Learned guessers calculate that the population of the Chinese states
in 280 b.c. was around 14,000,000; in 200 a.d., 28,000,000; in 726,
41,500,000; in 1644, 89,000,000; in 1743, 150,000,000; in 1919,
330,000,000“ In the fourteenth century a European traveler counted in
China “two hundred cities all greater than Venice.” 91 The Chinese
census is obtained through a registration law requiring every household
to inscribe the names of its occupants upon a tablet at the entrance; 28
we do not know how accurate these tablets are, or the reports which
purport to be based upon them. It is probable that China now harbors
some 400,000,000 souls.</p>

<li>The following description of Chinese society will apply chiefly to
the nineteenth century; the changes brought on by contact with the West
will be studied later. Every description must be taken with reserve,
since a civilization is never quite the same over a long period of time
or an extensive area of space.</li>
</ul>
<p>77 ° THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>The Chinese vary in stature, being shorter and weaker in the south,
taller and stronger in the north; in general they are the most vigorous
people in Asia. They show great physical stamina, magnificent courage in
the bear- ing of hardships and pain, exceptional resistance to disease,
and a climatic adaptability which has enabled them to prosper in almost
every zone. Neither opium nor inbreeding nor syphilis has been able to
impair their health, and the collapse of their social system has not
been due to any visi- ble deterioration in their biological or mental
vitality.</p>
<p>The Chinese face is one of the most intelligent on earth, though not
uni- versally attractive. Some of the pauper class are incomparably ugly
to our Western prejudice, and some criminals have an evil leer admirably
suited to cinematic caricature; but the great majority have regular
features calm with the physiological accident of low eyelids, and the
social accumulation of centuries of civilization. The slant of the eyes
is not so pronounced as one had been led to expect, and the yellow skin
is often a pleasant sun- tanned brown. The women of the peasantry are
almost as strong as the men; the ladies of the upper strata are delicate
and pretty, starch themselves with powder, rouge their lips and cheeks,
blacken their eyebrows, and train or thin them to resemble a willow leaf
or the crescent moon. 23 The hair in both sexes is coarse and vigorous,
and never curls. The women wear theirs in a tuft, usually adorned with
flowers. Under the last dynasty the men, to please their rulers, adopted
the Manchu custom of shaving the fore half of the head; in compensation
they left the remainder uncut and gathered it into a long queue, which
became in time an instrument of correction and a support of pride. 34
Beards were small, and were always shaved, though sel- dom by the owners
thereof; barbers carried their shops about with them, and throve.</p>
<p>The head was ordinarily left bare; when men covered it they used in
winter a cap of velvet or fur with a tumed-up rim, and in summer a
conical cap of finely woven filaments of bamboo, surmounted, in persons
of any rank, by a colored ball and a silken fringe. Women, when they
could af- ford it, clothed their heads with silk or cotton bands adorned
with tinsel, trinkets or artificial flowers. Shoes were usually of warm
cloth; since the floor was often of cold tile or earth, the Chinese
carried a miniature carpet with him under each foot. By a custom begun
at the court of the Em- peror Li Hou-chu (ca. 970 a.d.), the feet of
girls, at the age of seven, were compressed with tight bandages to
prevent their further growth, so that the mature lady might walk with a
mincing step erotically pleasing to the men. It was regarded as immodest
to speak of a woman’s foot, and as scandalous to look at one; in the
presence of a lady even the word for shoe was tabu. 25 The practice
spread to all ranks and groups except the Manchus and Tatars,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 77 1</p>
<p>and became so rigid that a deception about the size of the bride’s
foot suf - ficed to annul an engagement or a marriage. 28 K’ang -hsi
tried to stop the custom, but failed; today it is one of the happier
casualties of the Revolu- tion.</p>
<p>Men covered their nakedness with trousers and tunics, almost always
blue. In winter the trousers were overlaid with leggings, and additional
tunics, sometimes to the number of thirteen, were put on. These were
kept on night and day throughout the winter, and were removed one by one
with the progress of spring.* 7 The tunic fell variously to the loins,
or the knees, or the feet; it was buttoned closely up to the neck, and
had immense sleeves instead of pockets; China does not say that a man
“pocketed” an object, but that he “sleeved” it. Shirts and underwear
were well -nigh un- known. 28 In the country women wore trousers like
the men, since they were accustomed to doing a man’s work and more; in
the towns they covered the trousers with skirts. In the cities silk was
almost as common as cotton. 20 No belt compressed the waist, and no
corsets held in the breasts. In general the Chinese dress was more
sensible, healthy and convenient than the garb of the modern West. No
tyranny of fashion harassed or exalted the life of the Chinese woman;
all urban classes dressed alike, and nearly all generations; the quality
of the garment might differ, but not the form; and all ranks might be
sure that the fashion would last as long as the gown.</p>
<p>The language of the Chinese differed from the rest of the world even
more distinctly than their dress. It had no alphabet, no spelling, no
gram- mar, and no parts of speech; it is amazing how well and how long
this oldest and most populous nation on earth has managed without these
curses of Occidental youth. Perhaps in forgotten days there were inflec-
tions, declensions, conjugations, cases, numbers, tenses, moods; but the
language as far back as we can trace it shows none of them. Every word
in it may be a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb, according to its
context and its tone. Since the spoken dialects have only from four to
eight hundred monosyllabic word-sounds or vocables, and these must be
used to express the 40,000 characters of the written language, each
vocable has from four to nine “tones,” so that its meaning is made to
differ accord - ing to the manner in which it is sung. Gestures and
context eke out these tones, and make each sound serve many purposes; so
the vocable / may mean any one of sixty-nine things, shi may mean
fifty-nine, ku twenty- nine. 80 No other language has been at once so
complex, so subtle and so brief.</p>
<p>77 2 the story of civilization (chap. XXVI</p>
<p>The written language was even more unique than the spoken. The</p>
<p>objects exhumed in Honan, and tentatively dated back to the Shang
Dynasty, bear writing in characters substantially like those in use
until our own generation, so that — barring a few Copts who still speak
ancient Egyptian — Chinese is both the oldest and the most widespread
language spoken on the earth today. Originally, as we infer from a
passage in</p>
<p>Lao-tze, the Chinese used knotted cords to communicate messages.
Prob- ably the needs of priests in tracing magic formulas, and of
potters in marking their vessels, led to the development of a pictorial
script.” These primitive pictograms were the original form of the six
hundred signs that are now the fundamental characters in Chinese
writing. Some two hun- dred and fourteen of them have been named
“radicals” because they enter as elements into nearly all the characters
of the current language. The present characters are highly complex
symbols, in which the primi- tive pictorial element has been overlaid
with additions designed to define the term specifically, usually through
some indication of its sound. Not only every word, but every idea, has
its own separate sign; one sign repre- sents a horse, ano ther sign “a
bay horse with a white belly,” another “a horse with a white spot on his
forehead.” Some of the characters are still relatively simple: a curve
over a straight line (i.e., the sun over the</p>
<p>horizon) means “morning”; the sun and the moon toge ther represent
“fight”; a mouth and a bird together mean “singing”; a woman beneath a
roof means “peace”; a woman, a mouth and the sign for “crooked” con -
stitute the character for “dangerous”; a man and a woman together mean
“talkative”; “quarreling” is a woman with two mouths; “wife” is repre -
sented by signs for a woman, a broom and a storm.”</p>
<p>From some points of view this is a primitive language that has by</p>
<p>supreme conservatism survived into “modern” times. Its difficulties
are more obvious than its virtues. We are told that the Chinese takes
from ten to fifty years to become acquainted with all the 40,000
characters in his language; but when we realize that these characters
are not letters but ideas, and reflect on the length of time it would
take us to master 40,000 ideas, or even a vocabularly of 40,000 words,
we perceive that the terms of the comparison are unfair to the Chinese;
what we should say is that it takes any one fifty years to master 40,000
ideas. In actual practice the average Chinese gets along quite well with
three or four thousand signs, and learns these readily enough by finding
their “radicals.” The clearest</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 773</p>
<p>advantage of such a language — expressing not sounds but ideas — is
that it can be read by Koreans and Japanese as easily as by the Chinese,
and pro- vides the Far East with an international written language.
Again it unites in one system of writing all the inhabitants of China,
whose dialects differ to the point of mutual unintelligibility; the same
character is read as dif- ferent sounds or words in different
localities. This advantage applies in time as well as in space; since
the written language has remained essentially the same while the spoken
language has diverged from it into a hundred dialects, the literature of
China, written for two thousand years in these characters, can be read
today by any literate Chinese, though we cannot tell how the ancient
writers pronounced the words, or spoke the ideas, which the signs
represent. This persistence of the same script amidst a flux and
diversity of speech made for the preservation of Chinese thought and
culture, and at the same time served as a powerful force for conserva-
tism; old ideas held the stage and formed the mind of youth. The char-
acter of Chinese civilization is symbolized in this phenomenon of its
unique script: its unity amid diversity and growth, its profound
conservatism, and its unrivaled continuity. This system of writing was
in every sense a high intellectual achievement; it classified the whole
world — of objects, activi- ties and qualities — under a few hundred
root or “radical” signs, combined with these signs some fifteen hundred
distinguishing marks, and made them represent, in their completed forms,
all the ideas used in literature and life. We must not be too sure that
our own diverse modes of writing down our thoughts are superior to this
apparently primitive form. Leibnitz in the seventeenth century, and Sir
Donald Ross in our time, dreamed of a system of written signs
independent of spoken languages, free from their nationalist diversity
and their variations in space and time, and capable, therefore, of
expressing the ideas of different peoples in identical and mutually
intelligible ways. But precisely such a sign language, uniting a hundred
generations and a quarter of the earth’s inhabitants, already exists in
the Far East. The conclusion of the Oriental is logical and terrible:
the rest of the world must learn to write Chinese.</p>

<p>The poverty of the peasant — Methods of husbandry — Crops — Tea —
Food — The stoicism of the village</p>
<p>All the varied literature of that language, all the subtleties of
Chinese thought and the luxuries of Chinese life, rested in the last
analysis on the fertility of the fields. Or rather on the toil of men —
for fertile fields are not born but made. Through many centuries the
early inhabitants of China must have fought against jungle and forest,
beast and insect, drought and flood, saltpetre and frost to turn this
vast wilderness into fruitful soil. And the victory had to be
periodically rewon; a century of careless timber- cutting left a
desert,* and a few years of neglect allowed the jungle to return. The
struggle was bitter and perilous; at any moment the bar- barians might
rush in, and seize the slow growths of the cleared earth. Therefore the
peasants, for their protection, lived not in isolated home- steads but
in small communities, surrounded their villages with walls, went out
together to plant and cultivate the soil, and often slept through the
night on guard in their fields.</p>
<p>Their methods were simple, and yet they did not differ much from what
they are today. Sometimes they used ploughs — first of wood, then of
stone, then of iron; but more often they turned up their little plots
patiently with the hoe. They helped the soil with any natural fertilizer
they could find, and did not disdain to collect for this purpose the
offal of dogs and men. From the earliest times they dug innumerable
canals to bring the water of their many rivers to rice paddies or millet
fields; deep channels were cut through miles of solid rock to tap some
elusive stream, or to divert its course into a desiccated plain. Without
rotation of crops or artificial manures, and often without draft animals
of any kind, the Chinese have wrung two or three crops annually from at
least half their soil, and have won more nourishment from the earth than
any other people in history . 34</p>
<p>The cereals they grew were chiefly millet and rice, with wheat
and</p>
<p>barley as lesser crops. The rice was turned into wine as well as
food, but</p>

<p>the peasant never drank too much of it. His favorite drink, and next

<p>The poor man did not need so much time for his two meals a day. With
all his toil the peasant, with exceptions here and there, was never
secure from starvation until he was dead. The strong and clever
accumulated large estates, and concentrated the wealth of the country
into a few hands; occasionally, as under Shih Huang-ti, the soil was
redivided among the population, but the natural inequality of men soon
concentrated wealth again. 41 The majority of the peasants owned land,
but as the population increased faster than the area under cultivation,
the average holding be- came smaller with every century. The result was
a poverty equaled only by destitute India: the typical family earned but
3 a year, many men lived on two cents a day, and millions died of hunger
in each year. 43 For twenty centuries China has had an average of one
famine annually; 48 partly because the peasant was exploited to the
verge of subsistence, partly be*</p>

because trans- port was so undeveloped that one region might starve
while another had more than it required. Finally, flood might destroy
what the landlord and the tax-collector had left; the Hoang-ho — which
the people called “China’s Sorrow”— might change its course, swamp a
thousand villages, and leave another thousand with desiccated land.</p>
<p>The peasants bore these evils with stolid fortitude. “All that a

<p>ments — Printing-press inflation</p>
<p>Meanwhile industry flourished as nowhere else on earth before our
eight- eenth century. As far back as we can delve into Chinese history
we find busy handicrafts in the home and thriving trade in the towns.
The basic industries were the weaving of textiles and the breeding of
worms for the secretion of silk; both were carried on by women in or
near their cottages. Silk-weaving was a very ancient art, whose
beginnings in China went back to the second millennium before Christ.*
46 The Chinese fed the worms on fresh-cut mulberry leaves, with
startling results: on this diet a pound of (700,000) worms increased in
weight to 9,500 pounds in forty-two days. 47 The adult worms were then
placed in little tents of straw, around which * The spinning of silk out
of the cocoons of wild silkworms was known to the ancient classical
world; but the breeding of the worms and the gathering and weaving of
the silk as an industry were introduced into Europe from China by
Nestorian monks about 552 a.d . 46 The art was brought from
Constantinople to Sicily in the twelfth century, and to England in the
fifteenth.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 777</p>
<p>they wove their cocoons by emitting silk. The cocoons were dropped in
hot water, the silk came away from its shell, was treated and woven, and
was skilfully turned into a great variety of rich clothing, tapestries,
em- broideries and brocades for the upper classes of the world.* The
raisers and weavers of silk wore cotton.</p>
<p>Even in the centuries before Christ this domestic industry had been
sup- plemented with shops in the towns. As far back as 300 b.c. there
had been an urban proletariat, organized with its masters into
industrial guilds/ 9 The growth of this shop industry filled the towns
with a busy population, mak- ing the China of Kublai Khan quite the
equal, industrially, of eighteenth- century Europe. “There are a
thousand workshops for each craft,” wrote</p>
<p>The guilds undertook many of the functions which the once proud</p>
<p>citizens of the West have surrendered to the state: they passed their
own laws, and administered them fairly; they made strikes infrequent by
ar- bitrating the disputes of employers and employees through mediation
boards representing each side equally; they served in general as a
self-governing and self-disciplining organization for industry, and
provided an admirable escape from the modern dilemma between
laissez-faire and the servile state. These guilds were formed not only
by merchants, manufacturers and their work- men, but by such less
exalted trades as barbers, coolies and cooks; even the beggars were
united in a brotherhood that subjected its members to strict laws. 51 A
small minority of town laborers were slaves, engaged for the most part
in domestic service, and usually bonded to their masters for a period of
years, or for life. In times of famine girls and orphans were exposed
for sale at the price of a few “cash,” and a father might at any time
sell his daughters as bondservants. Such slavery, however, never reached
the pro- portions that it attained in Greece and Rome; the majority of
the work- ers were free agents or members of guilds, and the majority of
the peasants</p>

<p>owned their land, and governed themselves in village communities
largely independent of national control. 62</p>
<p>The products of labor were carried on the backs of men; even human
transport moved, for the most part, in sedan chairs raised upon the
bruised but calloused shoulders of uncomplaining coolies.* Heavy buckets
or enormous bundles were balanced on the ends of poles, and slung over
the shoulder. Sometimes dray-carts were drawn by donkeys, but more often
they were pulled by men. Muscle was so cheap that there was no en-
couragement to the development of animal or mechanical transport; and
the primitiveness of transportation offered no stimulus to the
improvement of roads. When European capital built the first Chinese
railway (1876) — a ten-mile line between Shanghai and Woosung — the
people protested that it would disturb and offend the spirit of the
earth; and the opposition grew so vigorous that the government bought
the railroad and heaved its rolling stock into the sea. 63 In the days
of Shih Huang-ti and Kublai Khan im- perial highways existed, paved with
stone; but only their outlines now re- main. The city streets were mere
alleys eight feet wide, designed with a view to keeping out the sun.
Bridges were numerous, and sometimes very beautiful, like the marble
bridge at the Summer Palace. Commerce and travel used avenues of water
almost as frequently as the land; 25,000 miles of canals served as a
leisurely substitute for railways; and the Grand Canal between Hangchow
and Tientsin, 650 miles long, begun about 300 a.d. and completed by
Kublai Khan was surpassed only by the Great Wall in the modest list of
China’s engineering achievements. “Junks” and sampans plied the rivers
busily, and provided not only cheap transportation for goods, but homes
for millions of the poor.</p>
<p>The Chinese are natural merchants, and work many hours at the
business of bargaining. Chinese philosophy and officialdom agreed in
despising traders, and the Han emperors taxed them heavily, and forbade
them to use carriages or silk. The educated classes displayed long nails
as Western women wore French heels — to indicate their exemption from
physical toil. 64 It was the custom to rank scholars, teachers and
officials as the highest class, farmers as the next, artisans as the
third, merchants as the lowest; for, said C hina, these last merely made
profits by exchanging the fruits of other men’s toil. Nevertheless they
prospered, carried the products of Chinese fields and workshops to all
corners of Asia, and became in the end the chief finan- cial support of
the government. Internal commerce was hindered by the likin tax, and
foreign trade was made hazardous by robbers on land and pirates on the
sea; but the merchants of China found a way, by sailing</p>
<p>A word of Hindu origin, probably from the Tamil kuli, hired
servant.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 779</p>
<p>around the Malay Peninsula or plodding the caravan routes through
Turk- estan, to get their goods to India, Persia, Mesopotamia, at last
even to Rome. 65 Silk and tea, porcelain and paper, peaches and
apricots, gunpowder and playing cards, were the staple exports; in
return for which the world sent to China alfalfa and glass, carrots and
peanuts, tobacco and opium.</p>
<p>Trade was facilitated by an ancient system of credit and coinage.</p>
<p>Merchants lent to one another at high rates of interest, averaging
some thirty-six per cent — though this was no higher than in Greece and
Rome.” Money-lenders took great risks, charged commensurate fees, and
were popular only at borrowing time; “wholesale robbers,” said an old
Chinese proverb, “start a bank.” 6 ’ The oldest known currency of the
country took the form of shells, knives and silk; the first metal
currency went back at least to the fifth century b.c.“ Under the Ch’in
Dynasty gold was made the standard of value by the government; but an
alloy of copper and tin served for the smaller coins, and gradually
drove out the gold.* When Wu Ti’s experiment with a currency of silver
alloyed with tin was ruined by counterfeiters, the coins were replaced
with leather strips a foot long, which became the foster-parents of
paper money. About the year 807, the supply of copper having, like
modern gold, become inadequate as com- pared with the rising abundance
of goods, the Emperor Hsien Tsung ordered that all copper currency
should be deposited with the govern- ment, and issued in exchange for it
certificates of indebtedness which re- ceived the name of “flying money”
from the Chinese, who appear to have taken their fiscal troubles as
good-naturedly as the Americans of 1933. The practice was discontinued
after the passing of the emergency; but the invention of block-printing
tempted the government to apply the new art to the making of money, and
about 935 a.d. the semi-independent pro- vince of Szechuan, and in 970
the national government at Ch’ang -an, be- gan the issuance of paper
money. During the Sung Dynasty a fever of printing- press inflation
ruined many fortunes.” “The Emperor’s Mint,” wrote Polo of Kublai’s
treasury, “is in the city of Cambaluc (Peking );</p>
<p>and the way it is wrought is such that you might say that he hath the
Secret of Alchemy in perfection, and you would be right. For he makes
his money after this fashion”— and he proceeded to arouse the
incredulous scorn of his countrymen by describing the process by which
the bark # Copper is still the dominant currency, in the form of the

worth a thousand “cash.”</p>

people as the equivalent of gold.® Such were the sources of that flood
of paper money which, ever since, has alternately accelerated and
threatened the economic life of the world.</p>

<p>Gunpowder, fireworks and war — The compass — Poverty of indus-</p>
<p>trial invention — Geography — Mathematics — Physics — “ Feng</p>
<p>shui”— Astronomy — Medicine — Hygiene</p>
<p>The Chinese have been more facile in making inventions than in using
them. Gunpowder appea red under the T’angs, but was very sensibly re -
stricted to fireworks; not until the Sung Dynasty ( 1 161 a.d.) was it
formed into hand-grenades and employed in war. The Arabs became
acquainted with saltpetre — the main constituent of gunpowder — in the
course of their trade with China, and called it “Chinese snow”; they
brought the secret of gunpowder westward, the Saracens turned it to
military use, and Roger Bacon, the first European to mention it, may
have learned of it through his study of Arab lore or his acquaintance
with the central Asiatic traveler, De Rubruquis. 61</p>
<p>The compass is of much greater antiquity. If we may believe Chinese
historians, it was invented by the Duke of Chou in the reign of the Em-

back to their home lands; the Duke, we are told, presented the embassy
with five chariots each equipped with a “south - pointing needle.”® Very
probably the magnetic properties of the lodestone were known to ancient
China, but the use of it was confined to orienting temples. The magnetic
needle was described in the Sung-shu, an historical work of the fifth
cen- tury a.d., and was attributed by the author to the astronomer Chang
Heng (d. 139 a.d.), who, however, had only rediscovered what China
had</p>
<p>known before. The oldest mention of the needle as useful for mariners
occurs in a work of the early twelfth century, which ascribes this use
of it to foreign — probably Arab — navigators plying between Sumatra and
Can- ton.® About 1 190 we find the first known European notice of the

<p>dustrially inventive people. They were inventive in art, developing
their own forms, and reaching a degree of sensitive perfection not
surpassed in any other place or time; but before 1912 they were content
with ancient economic ways, and had a perhaps prophetic scorn of
labor-saving devices that hectically accelerate the pace of human toil
and throw half the popu- lation out of work in order to enrich the rest.
They were among the first to use coal for fuel, and mined it in small
quantities as early as 122 b.c.; 65 but they developed no mechanisms to
ease the slavery of mining, and left for the most part unexplored the
mineral resources of their soil. Though they knew how to make glass they
were satisfied to import it from the West. They made no watches or
clocks or screws, and only the coarsest nails. 80 Through the two
thousand years that intervened between the rise of the Han and the fall
of the Manchus, industrial life remained substantially the same in China
— as it remained substantially the same in Europe from Pericles to the
Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>In like manner China preferred the quiet and mannerly rule of
tradition and scholarship to the exciting and disturbing growth of
science and plutoc- racy. Of all the great civilizations it has been the
poorest in contributions to the material technique of life. It produced
excellent textbooks of agri- culture and sericulture two centuries
before Christ, and excelled in treatises on geography. 07 Its
centenarian mathematician, Chang Ts’ang (d. 152 b.c.), left behind him a
work on algebra and geometry, containing the first known mention of a
negative quantity. Tsu Ch’ung -chih calculated the correct value of 7 r
to six decimal places, improved the magnet or “south -pointing vehicle,”
and is vaguely recorded to have experimented with a self -moving vessel.
68 Chang Heng invented a seismograph in 132 a.d.,* but for the most part
Chinese physics lost itself in the occultism of feng shui and the meta-
physics of the yang and the yin . t Chinese mathematicians apparently
derived algebra from India, but developed geometry for themselves out of
their need for measuring the land. 70 The astronomers of Confucius’ time
correctly cal - culated eclipses, and laid the bases of the Chinese
calendar — twelve hours a day, and twelve months each beginning with the
new moon; an extra month was added periodically to bring this lunar
calendar in accord with the seasons and the sun. 71 Life on earth was

Each dragon held a copper ball in its mouth. When an earthquake
occurred, the dragon nearest its source dropped its ball into the mouth
of the toad. Once a dragon released its ball, though no shock had been
felt by the inhabitants. Chang Heng was ridiculed as a charlatan, until
a messenger arrived who told of an earthquake in a distant province .

<p>festivals of the year were regulated by sun and moon; the moral order

<p>Medicine in China was a characteristic mixture of empirical wisdom
and popular superstition. It had its beginnings before recorded history,
and pro- duced great physicians long before Hippocrates. Already under
the Chous the state held yearly examinations for admission to medical
practice, and fixed the salaries of the successful applicants according
to their showing in the tests. In the fourth century before Christ a
Chinese governor ordered a careful dissection and anatomical study of
forty beheaded criminals; but the results were lost in theoretical
discussion, and dissection stopped. Chang Chung-ning, in the second
century, wrote treatises on dietetics and fevers, which remained
standard texts for a thousand years. In the third cen- tury Hua To wrote
a volume on surgery, and made operations popular by inventing a wine
which produced a general anesthesia; it is one of the stupidities of
history that the formula for mixing this drink has been lost. About 300
a.d. Wang Shu-ho wrote a celebrated treatise on the pulse. 73 Towards
the beginning of the sixth century T’ao Hung -ching composed an
extensive description of the 730 drugs used in Chinese medicine; and a
hun- dred years later Ch’ao Yuan -fang wrote a classic on the diseases
of women and children. Medical encyclopedias were frequent under the
T’angs, and specialist monographs under the Sungs. 78 A medical college
was established in the Sung Dynasty, but most medical education was
through apprentice- ship. Drugs were abundant and various; one store,
three centuries ago, sold a thousand dollars’ worth every day. 74
Diagnosis was pedantically detailed; ten thousand varieties of fever
were described, and twenty-four conditions of the pulse were
distinguished. Inoculation — not vaccination — was used, prob- ably in
imitation of India, in the treatment of small-pox; and mercury was
administered for syphilis. This disease seems to have appeared in China
in the later years of the Ming Dynasty, to have run wild through the
popula- tion, and to have left behind its course a comparative immunity
to its more serious effects. Public sanitation, preventive medicine,
hygiene and surgery made little progress in China; sewage and drainage
systems were primitive, or hardly existed; 78 and some towns failed to
solve the primary obligations of an organized society — to secure good
water, and to dispose of waste.</p>
<p>Soap was a rare luxury, but lice and vermin were easily secured. The
simpler Chinese learned to itch and scratch with Confucian equanimity.
Medical science made no ascertainable progress from Shih Huang-ti to the
Dowager; perhaps the same might be said of European medicine between
Hippocrates and Pasteur. European medicine invaded China as an annex to
Christianity; but the sick natives, until our own time, confined their
use of it to surgery, and for the rest preferred their own physicians
and their ancient herbs.</p>

<p>Chinese society was built not on science but on a strange and unique
mixture of religion, morals and philosophy. History has known no people
more superstitious, and none more sceptical; no people more devoted to
piety, and none more rationalistic and secular; no nation so free from
clerical domination, and none but the Hindus so blessed and cursed with
gods. How shall we explain these contradictions, except by ascribing to
the philosophers of China a degree of influence unparalleled in history,
and at the same time recognizing in the poverty of China an inexhausti-
ble fountain of hopeful fantasy?</p>
<p>The religion of the primitive inhabitants was not unlike the faith
of</p>
<p>nature peoples generally: an animistic fear and worship of spirits
lurking anywhere, a poetic reverence for the impressive forms and
reproductive powers of the earth, and an awed adoration of a heaven
whose energizing sunlight and fertilizing rains were part of the mystic
rapport between ter- restrial life and the secret forces of the sky.
Wind and thunder, trees and mountains, dragons and snakes were
worshiped; but the greater fes- tivals celebrated above all the miracle
of growth, and in the spring girls and young men danced and mated in the
fields to give example of fertility to mother earth. Kings and priests
were in those days near allied, and the early monarchs of China, in the
edifying accounts which tendentious historians gave of them in later
years, were statesmen-saints whose heroic deeds were always prefaced
with prayers, and aided by the gods.™</p>
<p>In this primitive theology heaven and earth were bound together as
two halves of a great cosmic unity, and were related very much as man
and woman, lord and vassal, yang and yin. The order of the heavens and
the moral behavior of mankind were kindred processes, parts of a uni-
versal and necessary rhythm called Tao — the heavenly way; morality,
like the law of the stars, was the cooperation of the part with the
whole. The Supreme God was this mighty heaven itself, this moral order,
this divine orderliness, that engulfed both men and things, dictating
the right rela-</p>
<p>784 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>tionship of children to parents, of wives to husbands, of vassals to
lords, of lords to the emperor, and of the emperor to God. It was a
confused but noble conception, hovering between personality when the
people prayed to THen — heaven as a deity — and impersonality when the
philoso- phers spoke of T’ien as the just and beneficent, but hardly
human or per - sonal, sum of all those forces that ruled the sky, the
earth, and men. Gradually, as philosophy developed, the personal
conception of “Heaven” was confined to the masses of the people, and the
impersonal conception was accepted by the educated classes and in the
official religion of the state.”</p>
<p>Out of these beginnings grew the two elements of the orthodox re-</p>
<p>ligion of China: the nation-wide worship of ancestors, and the
Confucian worship of heaven and great men. Every day some modest
offering — usually of food — was made to the departed, and prayers were
sent up to their spirits; for the simple peasant or laborer believed
that his parents and other forbears still lived in some ill-defined
realm, and could bring him good or evil fortune. The educated Chinese
offered similar sacrifice, but he looked upon the ritual not as worship
so much as commemoration; it was wholesome for the soul and the race
that these dead ones should be remembered and revered, for then the
ancient ways which they had followed would also be revered, innovation
would hesitate, and the empire would be at peace. There were some
inconveniences in this religion, for it littered China with immense
inviolable graves, impeding the construc- tion of railroads and the
tillage of the soil; but to the Chinese philosopher these were trivial
difficulties when weighed in the balance against the political stability
and spiritual continuity which ancestor worship gave to civilization.
For through this profound institution the nation, which was shut out
from physical and spatial unity by great distances and the poverty of
transport, achieved a powerful spiritual unity in time; the generations
were bound together with the tough web of tradition, and the individual
life received an ennobling share and significance in a drama of timeless
majesty and scope.</p>
<p>The religion adopted by the scholars and the state was at once a
widen- ing and a narrowing of this popular faith. Slowly, by increments
of rev- erence from century to century, Confucius was lifted up, through
imperial decrees, to a place second only to that of Heaven itself; every
school raised a tablet, every city a temple, in his honor; and
periodically the emperor and the officials offered incense and sacrifice
to his spirit or his</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 785</p>
<p>memory, as the greatest influence for good in all the rich memories
of the race. He was not, in the understanding of the intelligent, a god;
on the contrary he served for many Chinese as a substitute for a god;
those who attended the services in his honor might be agnostics or
atheists, and yet — if they honored him and their ancestors — they were
accepted by their communities as pious and religious souls. Officially,
however, the faith of the Confucians included a recognition of Shang-ti,
the Supreme Ruling Force of the world; and every year the emperor
offered ceremonious sacrifice, on the Altar of Heaven, to this
impersonal divinity. Nothing was said, in this official faith, of
immortality.” Heaven was not a place but the will of God, or the order
of the world.</p>
<p>This simple and almost rationalistic religion never quite satisfied
the people of China. Its doctrines gave too little room to the
imagination of men, too little answer to their hopes and dreams, too
little encourage- ment to the superstitions that enlivened their daily
life. For the people, here as everywhere, brightened the prose of
reality with the poetry of the supernatural; they felt a world of good
or evil spirits hovering in the air about them and the earth beneath,
and longed to appease the enmity or enlist the aid of these secret
powers by magic incantation or prayer. They paid diviners to read the
future for them in the lines of the I-Ching, or on the shells of
tortoises, or in the movements of the stars; they hired magicians to
orient their dwellings and graves to wind and water, and sorcerers to
bring them sunshine or rain.” They exposed t o death such children as
were born to them on “unlucky” days,” and fervent daughters sometimes
killed themselves to bring good or evil fortune to their parents.” In
the south, particularly, the Chinese soul inclined to mysticism; it was
repelled by the frigid rationalism of the Confucian faith, and hungered
for a creed that would give China, like other nations, deathless conso-
lations.</p>
<p>Therefore some popular theologians took the misty doctrine of Lao-tze
and gradually transformed it into a religion. To the Old Master and to
Chuang-tze the Tao had been a way of life for the attainment of indi-
vidual peace on earth; they do not seem ever to have dreamed of it as a
deity, much less as a price to be paid here for a life beyond the
grave.” But in the second century of our era these doctrines were
improved upon by men who claimed to have received, in direct line from
Lao-tze, an elixir that would confer immortality. This drink became so
popular that several emperors are said to have died from piou s
indulgence in it.” A</p>
<p>786 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>mystagogue in Szechuan (ca. 148 a.d.) offered to cure all diseases
with a simple talisman to be given in exchange for five packages of
rice. Ap- parently miraculous cures were effected, and those who were
not cured were told that their faith had been too weak.“ The people
flocked to the new religion, built temples for it, supported its
priesthood generously, and poured into the new faith some part of their
inexhaustible superstitious lore. Lao-tze was made a god, and was
credited with a supernatural con- ception; he had been born, the
faithful believed, already old and wise, having been in his mother’s
womb for eighty years.® They peopled the world with new devils and
deities, frightened away the one with fire- crackers exploding merrily
in the temple courts, and with mighty gongs called the others out of
slumber to hear their importunate prayers.</p>
<p>For a thousand years the Taoist faith had millions of adherents, con-
verted many emperors, and fought long battles of intrigue to wrest from
the Confucians the divine right to tax and spend. In the end it was
broken down not by the logic of Confucius, but by the coming of a new
religion even better suited than itself to inspire and console the
common man. For the Buddhism that began its migration from India to
China in the first century after Christ was not the hard and gloomy
doctrine that the Enlightened One had preached five hundred years
before; it was no ascetic creed, but a bright and happy faith in helping
deities and a flower- ing paradise; it took the form, as time went on,
of the Greater Vehicle, or Mahay ana, which Kanishka’s theologians had
adapted to the emotional needs of simple men; it presented China with
freshly personal and humane gods, like Amitabha, Ruler of Paradise, and
Kuan-yin, god-then-goddess of mercy; it filled the Chinese pantheon with
Lohans or Arhats — eighteen of the original disciples of Buddha — who
stood ready at every turn to give of their merits to help a bewildered
and suffering mankind. When, after the fall of the Han, China found
itself tom with political chaos,</p>
<p>and life seemed lost in a welter of insecurity and war, the harassed
nation turned to Buddhism as the Roman world was at the same time
turning to Christianity. Taoism opened its arms to take in the new
faith, and in time became inextricably mingled with it in the Chinese
soul. Emperors per- secuted Buddhism, philosophers complained of its
superstitions, statesmen were concerned over the fact that some of the
best blood of China was being sterilized in monasteries; but in the end
the government found again that religion is stronger than the state; the
emperors made treaties of peace with the new gods; the Buddhist priests
were allowed to collect alms</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 787</p>
<p>and raise temples, and the bureaucracy of officials and scholars was
per- force content to keep Confucianism as its own aristocratic creed.
The new religion took possession of many old shrines, placed its monks
and fanes along with those of the Taoists on the holy mountain Tai-shan,
aroused the people to many pious pilgrimages, contributed powerfully to
painting, sculpture, architecture, literature, and the development of
print- ing, and brought a civilizing measure of gentleness into the
Chinese soul. Then, it, too, like Taoism, fell into decay; its clergy
became corrupt, its doctrine was permeated more and more by sinister
deities and popular superstitions, and its political power, never
strong, was practically de- stroyed by the renaissance of Confucianism
under Chu Hsi. Today its temples are neglected, its resources are
exhausted, and its only devotees are its impoverished priests.“</p>
<p>Nevertheless it has sunk into the national soul, and is still part of
the complex but informal religion of the simpler Chinese. For religions
in China are not mutually exclusive as in Europe and America, nor have
they ever precipitated the country into religious wars. Normally they
tol- erate one another not only in the state but in the same breast; and
the average Chinese is at once an animist, a Taoist, a Buddhist and a
Confu- cianism He is a modest philosopher, and knows that nothing is
certain; perhaps, after all, the theologian may be right, and there may
be a para- dise; the best policy would be to humor all these creeds, and
pay many diverse priests to say prayers over one’s grave. While fortune
smiles, however, the Chinese citizen does not pay much attention to the
gods; he honors his ancestors, but lets the Taoist and the Buddhist
temples get along with the attentions of the clergy and a few women. He
is the most secular spirit ever produced, as a type, in known history;
this life absorbs him; and when he prays he asks not for happiness in
paradise, but for some profit here on earth.“ If the god does not answer
his prayers he may overwhelm him with abuse, and end by throwing him
into the river. “No image- maker worships the gods,” says a Chinese
proverb; “he knows wh at stuff they are made of.”“</p>
<p>Hence the average Chinese has not taken passionately to Mohamme-
danism or Christianity; these offered him a heaven that Buddhism had
already promised, but what he really wanted was a guarantee of happi-
ness here. Most of the fifteen million Chinese Moslems are not really
Chinese, but people of foreign origin or parentage.“ Christianity
entered China with the Nestorians about 636 a.d. The Emperor Tai Tsung
gave</p>
<p>7^8 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>it a sympathetic hearing, and protected its preachers from
persecution. In 781 the Nestorians of China raised a monument on which
they recorded their appreciation of this enlightened tolerance, and
their hope that Chris- tianity would soon win the whole land.“ Since
then Jesuit missionaries with heroic zeal and lofty learning, and
Protestant missionaries backed with great American fortunes, have
labored to realize the hope of the Nestorians. Today there are three
million Christians in China; one per cent of the population has been
converted in a thousand years.*</p>

<p>The subjection of woman — The Chinese character</p>
<p>Confucianism and ancestor worship survived so many rivals and so</p>
<p>many attacks, during twenty centuries, because they were felt to be
indispensable to that intense and exalted moral tradition upon which
China had founded its life. As these were the religious sanctions, so
the family was the great vehicle, of this ethical heritage. From parents
to children the moral code was handed down across the generations, and
became the invisible government of Chinese society; a code so stable and
strong that that society maintained its order and discipline through
nearly all the vicis- situdes of the unsteady state. “What the Chinese,”
said Voltaire, “best know, cultivate the most, and have brought to the
greatest perfection, is</p>
<ul>
<li>Christianity lost its opportunity early in the eighteenth century,
when a quarrel arose between the Jesuits and other Roman Catholic orders
in China. The Jesuits had, with characteristic statesmanship, found
formulas by which the essential elements of Chinese piety — ancestor
worship and the adoration of heaven — could be brought under Christian
forms without disrupting deep-rooted institutions or endangering the
moral stability of China; but the Dominicans and Franciscans demanded a
stricter interpretation, and de- nounced all Chinese theology and ritual
as inventions of the devil. The enlightened Emperor K’ang -hsi was
highly sympathetic to Christianity; he entrusted his children to Jesuit
tutors, and offered on certain conditions to become a Christian. When
the Church officially adopted the rigid attitude of the Dominicans and
the Franciscans, K’ang -hsi withdrew his support of Christianity, and
his successors decided to oppose it actively. 91 In later days the
greedy imperialism of the West weakened the persuasiveness of Chris -
tian preaching, and precipitated the passionate anti-Christianism of the
revolutionary Chinese.</li>

<p>morality .”” 2 “By building the house on a sound foundation,”
Confucius had said, “the world is made secure .” 10</p>
<p>The Chinese proceeded on the assumption that the purpose of a moral
code was to transform the chaos of sexual relations into an orderly
insti- tution for the rearing of children. The family’s reason for being
lay in the child. There could not, from the viewpoint of China, be too
many children: a nation was always subject to attack, and needed
defenders; the soil was rich, and could support many millions; even if
there should be a bitter struggle for existence in large families and
crowded communi- ties, the weakest would be eliminated, and the ablest
would survive and multiply to be a support and an honor to their aging
parents, and to tend the ancestral graves religiously. Ancestor worship
forged an endless chain of reproduction, and gave it a double strength;
the husband must beget sons not only to sacrifice to him after his
death, but to continue the sacri- fices to his ancestors. “There are
three things which are unfilial,” said Mencius; “and the greatest of
them is to have no posterity .” 01</p>
<p>Sons were prayed for, and mothers were shamed forever if they had
none; for sons could work better than girls in the fields, and could
fight better in war; and a regulation not unconscious of this had long
since decreed that only sons should be permitted to offer the ancestral
sacri- fice. Girls were a burden, for one had to rear them patiently
only to see them go off, at maturity, to their husban ds’ homes, to
labor there, and beget laborers, for another family. If too many
daughters came, and times were very hard, the infant girl might without
sin be left exposed in the furrows, to be killed by the night’s frost or
eaten by prowling swine . 06 Such progeny as survived the hazards and
ailments of childhood were brought up with the tenderest affection;
example took the place of blows in their education; and occasionally
they were exchanged for a while for the children of kindred families, so
that they might not be spoiled by an indulgent love . 09 The children
were kept in the women’s division of the home, and seldom mingled with
the adult males until the age of seven. Then the boys, if the family
could afford it, were sent to school, and were severely separated from
the girls; from the age of ten they would be limited in their choice of
associates to men and courtesans; and the fre- quency of homosexuality
and male prostitution sometimes made this choice unreal.”</p>
<p>Chastity was exalted and rigidly enforced in daughters, and was
incul- cated with such success that Chinese girls have been known to
kill them-</p>
<p>79° the story of civilization (chap.xxvi</p>
<p>selves because they believed that they had been dishonored by the
acci- dental touch of a man . 88 But no effort was made to maintain
chastity in the unmarried man; on the contrary, it was considered normal
and legitimate that he should visit brothels; sex (in the male) was an
appetite like hunger, and might be indulged in without any other
disgrace than that which would in any case attach to immoderation. 88 *
The supply of women to meet these demands had long since been an
established institution in China; the famous premier of T’si, Kuan
Chung, had provided a lupanar where</p>
<p>Premarital relations were so free for men, and premarital association
with men was so restricted for respectable women, that small opportunity
was given for the growth of romantic love. A literature of such tender
affection appeared under the T’angs, and some indication of the
sentiment may be found as far back as the sixth century before Christ in
the legend of Wei Sheng, who, having promised to meet a girl under a
bridge, waited vainly for her there, though the water rose above his
head and drowned him. 1 ” Doubtless Wei Sheng knew better than this, but
it is significant that the poets thought that he might not. In general,
however, love as a tender solicitude and attachment was more frequent
between men than between the sexes; in this matter the Chinese agreed
with the Greeks . 105</p>
<p>Marriage had little to do with love; since its purpose was to
bring</p>
<p>healthy mates together for the rearing of abundant families, it could
not, the Chinese thought, be left to the arbitrament of passion. Hence
the sexes were kept apart while the parents sought eligible mates for
their children. It was considered immoral for a man not to marry;
celibacy was a crime against one’s ancestors, the state and the race,
and was never</p>

<li>Men sometimes prepared themselves openly for a night in a brothel by
pictures, aphrodisiacs and songs . 100 It should be added that this

<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 791</p>
<p>quite condoned even in the case of the clergy. In the ancient days
a</p>
<p>special official was appointed to see to it that every man was
married by the age of thirty, and every woman by twenty . 108 With or
without the help of professional intermediaries ( mei- ren , “go -
betweens”), parents arranged the betrothal of their children soon after
puberty, sometimes before puberty, sometimes before birth . 107 Certain
endogamic and ex- ogamic limits were placed on the choice: the mate had
to be of a family long known to the match-seeking parents, and yet
sufficiently distant in relationship to be outside the clan. The father
of the boy usually sent a substantial present to the father of the girl,
but the girl in her turn was expected to bring a considerable dowry,
chiefly in the form of goods, to her husband; and gifts of some value
were ordinarily exchanged between the families at the marriage. The girl
was kept in strict seclusion until the wedding. Her future mate could
not see her except by stratagem — though that was often managed; in many
cases he saw her for the first time when he removed her veil in the
wedding cermony. This was a complex and symbolic ritual, in which the
essential matter was that the bridegroom should be sufficiently wined to
guard against the chance of a criminal bashfulness on his part ; 106 as
for the girl, she had been trained to be at once shy and obedient. After
the marriage the bride lived with her husband in or near the house of
his father; there she labored in servitude to her mate and his mother,
until such time as the normal course of life and death liberated her
from this slavery and left her ready to impose it upon the wives of her
sons.</p>
<p>The poor were monogamous; but so eager was China for vigorous chil-
dren that such men as could afford it were permitted by custom to take
concubines, or “secondary wives.” Polygamy was looked upon as eugenic,
on the ground that those who could bear its expense would on the average
be the abler men in their communities. If the first wife remained child-
less she would in most cases urge her husband to take an additional
mate, and would often adopt as her own the child of the concubine. There
were many instances in which wives, anxious to keep their husbands home,
suggested that they should marry the courtesans to whom they were giv-
ing their attention and their substance, and should bring them home as
secondary wives . 100 The wife of the Emperor Chuang-tchu was much
praised in Chinese tradition because she was reported to have said: “I
have never ceased to send people to all the neighboring towns to look
for beau- tiful women in order that I might represent them as concubines
to my</p>
<p>79 2 the story of civilization (chap. XXVI</p>
<p>lord.” 130 Families rivaled one another in seeking the honor of
providing a daughter for the royal harem. To guard the harem, and to
attend to other duties at his court, the emperor was entitled to three
thousand eunuchs. Most of these had been mutilated by their parents
before the age of eight, in order to ensure their livelihood. 111</p>
<p>In this paradise of the male the secondary wives were practically
slaves, and the chief wife was merely the head of a reproductive
establishment. Her prestige depended almost entirely on the number and
sex of her children. Educated to accept her husband as a lord, she might
win some modest happiness by falling quietly into the routine expected
of her; and so adaptive is the human soul that the wife and husband, in
these pre- arranged unions, seem to have lived in a peace no more
violent than that which follows the happy endings of Western romantic
love. The woman could be divorced for almost any cause, from barrenness
to loquacity; 113 she herself could never divorce her husband, but she
might leave him and return to her parents — though this was a matter of
rare resort. Divorce in any case was infrequent; partly because the lot
of the divorced woman was too unpleasant to be thought of, partly
because the Chinese were natural philosophers, and took suffering as the
order of the day.</p>
<p>Very probably, in pre-Confucian times, the family had centered around
the mother as the source of its existence and its authority. In the
earliest period, as we have seen, the people “knew their mothers but not
their fathers”; and the character for a man’s family name is still
formed from the radical for “woman.” 113 The word for “wife” meant
“equal”; and the wife preserved her own name after marriage. As late as
the third century of our era women held high administrative and
executive positions in China, even to ruling the state;” 4 the “Dowager
Empress” merely followed in the steps of that Empress Lu who ruled China
so severely from 195 to 180 b.c. Lu, “hard and inflexible,” killed and
poisoned her rivals and enemies with all the gusto of a Medicean; she
chose and deposed kings, and had her husband’s favorite concubine shorn
of ears and eyes an d thrown into a latrine.” 6 Though hardly one in ten
thousand Chinese were</p>

<p>Probably the establishment of the feudal system in China reduced the
political and economic status of woman, and brought with it an
especially rigorous form of the patriarchal family. Usually all the male
descendants, and their wives and children, lived with the oldest male;
and though the family owned its land in common, it acknowledged the
complete authority of the patriarch over both the family and its
property. By the time of Confucius the power of the father was almost
absolute: he could sell his wife or his children into servitude, though
he did so only under great need; and if he wished he could put his
children to death with no other restraint than public opinion.™ He ate
his meals alone, not inviting either his wife or his children to table
with him except on rare occasions. When he died his widow was expected
to avoid remarriage; formerly she had been required to commit suttee in
his honor, and cases of this occurred in China to the end of the
nineteenth century.™ He was courteous to his wife, as to everybody, but
he maintained a severe distance, almost a separa- tion of caste, between
himself and his wife and children. The women lived in distinct quarters
of the home, and seldom mingled with the men; social life was
exclusively male, except for promiscuous women. The man</p>
<p>thought of his wife as the mother of his children; he honored her not
for her beauty or her culture, but for her fertility, her industry and
her obe- dience. In a celebrated treatise the Lady Pan Ho-pan, from the
same eleva- tion of aristocracy, wrote with edifying humility of the
proper condition of women:</p>
<p>We occupy the last place in the human species, we are the weaker</p>
<p>part of humanity; the basest functions are, and should be, our
por-</p>
<p>tion. . . . Rightly and justly does the Book of the Laws of the</p>
<p>Sexes make use of these words: “If a woman has a husband after</p>
<p>her own heart, it is for her whole life; if a woman has a husband</p>
<p>against her heart, it is also for life.”™</p>
<p>And Fu Hsuan sang:</p>
<p>How sad it is to be a woman!</p>
<p>Nothing on earth is held so cheap.</p>

<p>Like gods fallen out of heaven.</p>

<p>No one is glad when a girl is bom:</p>
<p>By her the family sets no store.</p>
<p>When she grows up she hides in her room.</p>
<p>Afraid to look a man in the face.</p>

<p>She bows her head and composes her face,</p>
<p>Her teeth are pressed on her red lips:</p>
<p>She bows and kneels countless times. m</p>
<p>Perhaps such quotations do injustice to the Chinese home. There was
rank subjection in it, and quarrels were frequent between man and woman,
and among the children; but there were also much kindness and affection,
much mutual helpfulness, and constant cooperation in the busy function-
ing of a natural home. Though economically subordinate the woman en-
joyed the franchise of the tongue, and might scold her man into fright
or flight in the best Occidental style. The patriarchal family could not
be de- mocratic, much less egalitarian, because the state left to the
family the task of maintaining social order; the home was at once a
nursery, a school, a workshop and a government. The relaxation of family
discipline in Amer- ica has been made possible only by the economic
unimportance of the urban home, and the appropriation of family
functions by the school, the factory and the state.</p>
<p>The type of character produced by these domestic institutions has won
the highest praise of many travelers. Allowing for the many exceptions
that weaken every social generalization, the average Chinese was a model
of filial obedience and devotion, of wholesome respect and willing care
for the old.* He accepted patiently the character-forming precepts of
the Li-chi or Book of Ceremonies, carried easily its heavy burden of
etiquette, regulated every phase of his life with its rules of
passionless courtesy, and acquired under it an ease and excellence of
manners, a poise and dignity of bearing, unknown to his compeers of the
West — so that a coolie carry- ing dung through the streets might show
better breeding, and more self- respect, than the alien merchant who
sold him opium. The Chinese learned the art of compromise, and
graciously “saved the face” of h is worsted</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese legend illustrates this with characteristic humor by the
story of Hakuga, who was whipped daily by his mother, but never cried.
One day, however, he cried as he was being beaten; and being asked the
cause of this unusual disturbance he answered that he wept because his
mother, now old and weak, was unable to hurt him with her blows. 15

<p>enemy. He was occasionally violent in speech and always loquacious,
often unclean and not invariably sober, given to gambling and gluttony,*
to petty peculation and courteous mendacity; 1 “ he worshiped the God of
Wealth with too frank an idolatry, 1 ® and was as hungry for gold as a
caricatured American; he was capable occasionally of cruelty and bru-
tality, and accumulating injustices sometimes provoked him to mass out-
breaks of pillage and slaughter. But in nearly all cases he was
peaceable and kindly, ready to help his neighbors, disdainful of
criminals and war- riors, thrifty and industrious, leisurely but steady
at his work, simple and unassuming in his mode of life, and
comparatively honest in commerce and finance. He was silent and patient
under the whip of adversity, and took good and evil fortune alike with a
wise humility; he bore bereave- ment and agony with fatalistic
self-control, and showed little sympathy for those who suffered them
audibly; he mourned long and loyally for his departed relatives, and
(when all his compromises had failed to elude it) faced his own death
with philosophic calm. He was as sensitive to beauty as he was
insensitive to pain; he brightened his cities with colorful decora-
tion, and adorned his life with the maturest art.</p>
<p>If we wish to understand this civilization we must forget for a
moment the bitter chaos and helplessness into which it has been thrown
by its own internal weakness and by contact with the superior guns and
machines of the West; we must see it at any of its many apogees — under
the Chou princes, or Ming Huang, or Hui Tsung, or K’ang -hsi. For in
those quiet and beauty-loving days the Chinese represented without doubt
the highest civilization and the ripest culture that Asia, or perhaps
any continent, had yet achieved.</p>

<p>ernment is that which governs least, then the Chinese have had the
best. Never has a government governed so many people, or governed them
so little, or so long.</p>
<p>Not that individualism, or individual liberty, flourished in China;
on</p>
<p>the contrary, the concept of the individual was weak, and lost him in
the groups to which he belonged. He was, first of all, a member of a
family and a passing unit in a stream of life between his ancestors and
his pos- terity; by law and custom he was responsible for the acts of
the others of his household, and they were responsible for his. Usually
he belonged to some secret society, and, in the town, to a guild; these
limited his rights to do as he pleased. A web of ancient custom bound
him, and a powerful public opinion threatened him with ostracism if he
seriously violated the morals or traditions of the group. It was
precisely the strength of these popular organizations, rising naturally
out of the needs and voluntary cooperation of the people, that made it
possible for China to maintain itself in order and stability despite the
weakness of law and the state.</p>
<p>But within the framework of these spontaneous institutions of
self-gov- ernment the Chinese remained politically and economically
free. The great distances that separated one city from another, and all
of them from the imperial capital, the dividing effect of mountains,
deserts, and unbridged or unnavigable streams, the lack of transport and
quick communication, and the difficulty of supporting an army large
enough to enforce some central will upon four hundred million people,
compelled the state to leave to each district an almost complete
autonomy.</p>
<p>The unit of local administration was the village, loosely ruled by
the family heads under the eye of a “headman” named by the government; a
group of villages gathered about a town constituted a hien, or county,
of which there were some thirteen hundred in China; two or more hien,
ruled together from a city, constituted a fu; two or more fu formed a
tao, or circuit; two or more tao made a sheng, or province; and eighteen
provinces, under the Manchus, made the empire. The state appointed a
magistrate to act as administrator, tax-collector and judge in each
hien; a chief officer for each f« and each tao; and a judge, a
treasurer, a governor, and sometimes a viceroy, for each province.’*’
But these officials normally contented them- selves with collecting
taxes and “squeezes,” judging such cases as volun - tary arbitration had
failed to settle, and, for the rest, leaving the maintenance of order to
custom, the family, the clan and the guild. Each province was a
semi-independent state, free from imperial interference or central
legislation</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 797</p>
<p>so long as it paid its tax-allotment and kept the peace. Lack of
facilities for communication made the central government more an idea
than a reality. The patriotic emotions of the people were spent upon
their districts and provinces, and seldom extended to the empire as a
whole.</p>
<p>In this loose structure law was weak, unpopular, and diverse. The
people preferred to be ruled by custom, and to settle their disputes by
face-sav- ing compromises out of court. They expressed their view of
litigation by such pithy proverbs as “Sue a flea and catch a bite,” or
“Win your law - suit, lose your money.” In many to wns of several
thousand population years passed without a case coming into the courts .
118 The laws had been codified under the T’ang emperors, but they dealt
almost entirely with crime, and attempted no formulation of a civil
code. Trials were simple, for no lawyer was allowed to argue a case in
court, though licensed</p>
<p>notaries might occasionally prepare, and read to the magistrate, a
state- ment in behalf of a client . 188 There were no juries, and there
was scant protection in the law again:: the sudden seizure and secret
retention of a person by the officers of the state. Suspects were
finger-printed , 180 and confessions were sometimes elicited by tortures
slightly more physical than those now used for such purposes in the most
enlightened cities. Punishment was severe, but hardly as barbarous as in
most other countries of Asia; it began with cutting off the hair, and
went on to flogging, ban- ishment or death; if the criminal had
exceptional merits or rank, he might be allowed to kill himself . 181
There were generous commutations of sen- tences, and capital punishment
could in normal times be imposed only by the emperor. Theoretically, as
with us, all persons were equal before the law. These laws never availed
to prevent brigandage on the highways or corruption in office and the
courts, but they cooperated modestly with custom and the family to give
China a degree of social order and personal security not equaled by any
other nation before our century . 188</p>
<p>Poised precariously above these teeming millions sat the emperor. In
theory he ruled by divine right; he was the “Son of Heaven,” and repre -
sented the Supreme Being on earth.* By virtue of his godlike powers he
ruled the seasons and commanded men to coordinate their lives with the
divine order of the universe. His decrees were laws, and his judgments
were</p>

<p>the final court; he administered the state and was the head of its
religion; he appointed all officials, examined the highest contestants
for office, and chose his successor to the throne. Actually his powers
were wholesomely limited by custom and law. He was expected to rule
without contraven- ing the regulations that had come down from the
sacred past; he might at any moment be rebuked by a strange dignitary
known as the Censor; he was in effect imprisoned by a ring of
counsellors and commissioners whose advice it was usually expedient for
him to accept; and if he ruled very un- justly or unwell he lost, by
common custom and consent, the “mandate</p>
<p>The Censor was head of a board whose function it was to inspect all
officials in the administration of their duties; and the emperor was not
exempt from this supervision. Several times in the course of history the
Censor has reproved the emperor himself. For example, the Censor Sung
respectfully suggested to the Emperor Chia Ch’ing (1796 -1821 a.d.) a
moderation in his attachment to actors and strong drink. Chia Ch’ing
summoned Sung to his presence, and angrily asked him what punishment was
proper for so insolent an official. Sung answered, “Death by the slic -
ing process.” Ordered to select a milder penalty, he answered, “Let me
be beheaded.” Ordered to select a milder penalty, he recommended
that</p>
<p>The imperial government had come to be a highly complex administra-
tive machine. Nearest to the throne was the Grand Council, composed of
four “Great Ministers,” usually headed by a prince of the royal blood;
by custom it met daily, in the early hours of the morning, to determine
the policies of the state. Superior in rank but inferior in influence
was another group of adv isers called the “Inner Cabinet.” The work of
administration was headed by “Six Boards”: of Civil Office, of Revenue,
of Ceremonies, of War, of Punishments, and of Works. There was a
Colonial Office, for managing such distant territories as Mongolia,
Sinkiang and Tibet; but there was no Foreign Office: China recognized no
other nations as its equals, and made no provisions for dealing with
them beyond arrangements for the re- ception of tribute-bearing
embassies.</p>
<p>The weakness of the government lay in its limited revenues, its
inadequate defenses, and its rejection of any instructive intercourse
with the outside world. It taxed the land, monopolized the sale of salt,
and impeded the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 799</p>
<p>development of commerce by levying, after 1852, a duty on the transit
of goods along the main routes of die country; but the poverty of the
people, the difficulty of collection, and the dishonesty of the
collectors kept the national revenue at too low a point to finance the
naval and military forces that might have saved China from invasion and
shameful defeat.* Perhaps the basic defect was in the personnel of the
government; the ability and honesty of its officials deteriorated
throughout the nineteenth century, and left the nation essentially
leaderless when half the wealth and power of the world were joining in
an assault upon its independence, its resources and its
institutions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless those officials had been chosen by the most unique, and
all in all the most admirable, method ever developed for the selection
of public servants. It was a method that would have interested Plato;
and despite its failure and abandonment today it still endears China to
the philosopher. Theoretically, the plan provided a perfect
reconciliation of aristocracy and democracy: all men were to have an
equal opportunity to make themselves fit for office, but office was to
be open only to those who had made themselves fit. Practically, the
method produced good results for a thousand years.</p>
<p>It began in the village schools — simple private institutions, often
no more than a room in a cottage — where an individual teacher, out of
his own meager remuneration, provided an elementary education for the
sons of the prosperous; the poorer half of the population remained
illiterate. 137 These schools were not financed by the state, nor were
they conducted by the clergy; education, like marriage, remained, in
China, independent of religion, except in so far as Confucianism was its
creed. Hours were long and discipline was severe in these modest
schoolhouses: the children reported to the teacher at sunrise, studied
with him till ten, had breakfast, resumed their studies till five, and
then were free for the day. Vacations were few and brief: there were no
lessons after noon in the summer, but to atone for this leisure to work
in the fields there were school sessions in the winter evenings. The
chief instruments of instruction were the writings</p>

maintenance of order, are compared with the 50,000,000 exacted of China
by Japan in 1894, and the 00,000,000 indemnity asked by the Allies after
the Boxer Rebellion, the collapse of China becomes a mere matter of
bookkeeping.</li>

<p>of Confucius, the poetry of the T’ang, and a whip of clinging bamboo.
The method was memory: day after day the young students learned by
heart, and discussed with their teacher, the philosophy of K’ung the Mas
- ter, until almost every word of it had sunk into their memories, and
some of it into their hearts; China hoped that in this joyless and
merciless way even a peasant lad might be turned into a philosopher and
a gentleman. The graduate emerged with little information and much
understanding, factually ignorant and mentally mature.*</p>
<p>It was on the basis of this education that China established — first
tenta- tively under the Han, then definitely under the T’ang, dynasties—
its sys- tem of examinations for public office. It is an evil for the
people, said China, that its rulers should learn to rule by ruling; as
far as possible they should learn to rule before ruling. It is an evil
for the people that they should have no access to office, and that
government should be the privi- lege of an hereditary few; but it is
good for the people that office should be confined to those who have
been prepared for it by ability and training. To offer to all men
democratically an equal opportunity for such training, and to restrict
office aristocratically to those who proved themselves best, was the
solution that China proposed for the ancient and insoluble problem of
government.</p>
<p>Therefore it periodically arranged, in each district, a public
examina- tion to which all males of any age were eligible. It tested the
applicant in his memory and understanding of the writings of Confucius,
in his knowl- edge of Chinese poetry and history, and in his capacity to
write intelli- gently on the issues of moral and political life. Those
who failed might study more and try again; those who succeeded received
the degree of Hsiu ts’ai, entitling them to membership in the literary
class, and to pos - sible appointment to minor local offices; but more
important than this, they became eligible — either at once or after
further preparation — for the tri- ennial provincial examinations, which
offered similar but harder tests. Those who failed here might try again,
and many did, so that some men passed these tests after eighty years of
living and studying, and not a few died in the midst of the
examinations. Those who succeeded were eligi-</p>

often financed through such school- ing by men of means, on the

appointment to office and their access to “squeeze.”</h1>

<p>ble for appointment to minor positions in the national service; and
at the same time they were admitted to a final and especially severe
examination at Peking. There in the Examination Hall were ten thousand
cells, in which the contestants, cribbed and confined, lived with their
own food and bedding for three separate days, while they wrote essays or
theses on sub- jects announced to them after their imprisonment. The
cells were un- heated, uncomfortable, ill-lighted and unsanitary; only
the spirit mattered! Typical test s were the composition of a poem on
the theme: “The sound of the oars, and the green of the hills and
water”; and the writing of an essay on this passage from the Confucian
Classics: “Tsang Tsze said, ‘To possess ability, and yet ask of those
who do not; to know much, and yet inquire of those who know little; to
possess, and yet appear not to possess; to be full, and yet appear
empty.’” There was not a word in any of the tests about science,
business or industry; the object was to reveal not knowledge but
judgment and character. Those who survived the tests were at last
eligible for the higher offices in the state.</p>
<p>The defects of the plan grew in the course of time. Though dishonesty
in taking or judging the tests was sometimes punished with death, dis-
honesty found a way. The purchase of appointments became frequent and
flagrant in the nineteenth century; 1 ” an inferior officer, for
example, sold twenty thousand forged diplomas before he was exposed. 1 ”
The form of the trial essay came to be a matter of custom, and students
prepared themselves for it mechanically. The curriculum of studies
tended to for- malize culture and impede the progress of thought, for
the ideas that cir- culated in it had been standardized for hundreds of
years. The graduates became an official .and intellectual bureaucracy,
naturally arrogant and humanly selfish, occasionally despotic and often
corrupt, and yet immune to public recall or control except through the
desperate resort of the boy- cott or the strike. In short, the system
had the faults that might be ex- pected of any governmental structure
conceived and operated by men. The faults of the system belonged to the
men, not to the system; and no other had less.*</p>
<p>The merits of the system were abundant. Here were no manipulated
nominations, no vulgar campaigns of misrepresentation and hypocrisy, no
* “Seldom,” says Dr. Latourette, “has any large group of mankind been so
prosperous and so nearly contented as were the Chinese under this
governmental machinery when it was dominated by the ablest of the
monarchs” This was likewise the opinion of the</p>

<p>sham battles of twin parties, no noisy or corrupt elections, no
ascent to office through a meretricious popularity. It was a democracy
in the best sense of the term, as equality of opportunity for all in the
competition for leadership and place; and it was an aristocracy in its
finest form, as a gov- ernment by the ablest men, democratically
selected from every rank in every generation. By this system the
national mind and ambition were turned in the direction of study, and
the national heroes and models were men of culture rather than masters
of wealth.* It was admirable that a society should make the experiment
of being ruled, socially and politically, by men trained in philosophy
and the humanities. It was an act of high tragedy when that system, and
the entire civilization of which it formed the guiding part, were struck
down and destroyed by the inexorable forces of evolution and
history.</p>
