<h4 id="chapter-xiii-the-enlightenment-in-austria">CHAPTER XIII The
Enlightenment in Austria</h4>
<p>1 75 6 _ 9 °</p>
<p>I. THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>S TRICTLY, Austria designates a nation; loosely it may stand for the
em- pire of which Austria was the head. Formally, till 1 806, this was
the Holy Roman Empire, which had included Germany, Bohemia, Poland,
Hungary, and parts of Italy and France. But nationalistic aims had so
weakened Im- perial allegiance that what now (175 6) survived was really
an Austro-Hun- garian Empire, embracing Austria, Styria, Carinthia,
Carniola, the Tirol, Hungary, Bohemia, the Catholic archbishoprics of
Cologne, Trier, and Mainz, diverse and varying parts of Italy, and,
since 1713, the formerly Spanish, now Austrian, Netherlands —
approximately the Belgium of today.</p>
<p>Hungary, with a population of some five million souls, was proudly
feudal. Four fifths of the soil were owned by Magyar nobles, and were
tilled by serfs; taxes fell only upon the peasants and the German or
Slav burghers of the towns. The new empire had had its legal birth in
1687, when the Hun- garian nobles renounced their ancient right of
electing their king, and ac- knowledged the Hapsburg emperors as their
sovereigns. Maria Theresa, fol- lowing Bourbon strategy, invited the
leading Hungarian magnates to her court, gave them offices, titles, and
ribbons, and lulled them into accepting Imperial law for their domains,
and Vienna for their capital. In generous response the Empress
commissioned Lukas von Hildebrandt to draw up plans for governmental
buildings in Buda; the work was begun in 1769, and was renewed in 1894,
giving the old capital one of the most impressive royal structures in
the world. Rivaling the Queen, rich Hungarian nobles built lordly
chateaux along the Danube or in their mountain retreats; so Prince Pal
Esterhazy built a family seat at Eisenstadt (1663-72), and Prince Miklos
Jozsef Esterhazy built in Renaissance style, some thirty miles away, the
new Schloss Esterhazy (1764-66). Here were 126 guest rooms, two great
halls for receptions and balls, a rich collection of art, and, nearby, a
library of 7,500 volumes, and a theater with four hundred seats. Around
the palace a vast swamp was transformed into gardens decorated with
grottoes, temples, and statuary, with hothouses, orangeries, and game
preserves. Said a French traveler: “There is no place— perhaps excepting
Versailles — that equals this castle in splendor.” Here came painters,
sculptors, actors, singers, virtuosi; here, for a full generation, Haydn
conducted, composed, and longed for a larger world.</p>
<p>Bohemia, which is now the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, did not fare
so</p>

<p>34 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>well under Maria Theresa’s rule. It had withdrawn from history after
the Thirty Years’ War, its national spirit broken by foreig n rule, and
by a Cath- olic creed imposed upon a people that had once known Jan Hus
and Jerome of Prague. Its eight million inhabitants suffered the wounds
of war in the repeated conflicts between Prussia and Austria, and its
historic capital changed hands again and again as its alien Queen passed
from defeat to vic- tory to defeat. Bohemia had to content itself with
an independence of culture and taste; it developed its own composers,
like Georg Benda, and Prague distinguished itself by giving a hea rty
reception to the premiere of Mozart’s Don Giovanni (1787), which Vienna
later damned with faint applause.</p>
<p>In the Austrian Netherlands the struggle of local dignitaries to
retain their traditional authority was more successful than in Bohemia;
it was to cloud with tragedy the last days of the “revolutionary
Emperor.” Those seven provinces — Brabant (which included Brussels,
Antwerp, and Louvain), Lux- embourg, Limburg, Flanders, Hainaut, Namur,
and Gelders — had an ancient and prestigious history, and the nobles who
ruled their four million souls were jealous of the privileges that had
survived so many centuries of trial. “Society” displayed its fashions,
gambled its gains, and sometimes drank the waters, as well as the wines,
at Spa in the neighboring episcopate of Liege. The flower of that
society in this age was Prince Charles- Joseph de Ligne, whom Brussels
gave to the world in 1735. He was tutored by several abbes, “only one of
whom believed in God”; he himself was “devout for a fort - night” 1 in
this strongly Catholic country. He fought with distinction in the Seven
Years’ War, served Joseph II as counselor and intimate friend, joined
the Russian army in 1787, accompanied Catherine the Great in her “prog -
ress” to the Crimea, built himself a luxurious chateau and art gallery
near Brussels, wrote thirty-four volumes of Melanges, impressed even the
French with the perfection of his manners, and amused the cosmopolitan
circles of Europe with his philosophic wit. #</p>
<p>It was this complex empire, stretching from the Carpathians to the
Rhine, which for forty years submitted to one of the great women of
history.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MARIA THERESA</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen her in war; there she yielded only to Frederick and Pitt
in military statesmanship, in scope of view and pertinacity of purpose,
in courage confronting defeat. Said Frederick in 1752: “Except the Queen
of Hungary and the King of Sardinia [Charles Emmanuel I], whose genius
triumphed over a bad education, all the princes of Europe are only
illustrious imbeciles.” 3 Elizabeth I of England before her, and
Catherine II of Russia after her, excelled her in the art of rule; no
other queens. Frederick thought her “ambitious and vengeful,” 4 but did
he expect her to seek no redress for his rape of Silesia? The Goncourts
saw in her “a good average brain with a</p>

many think, and no fool ever knew how to do it.” 2</li>

<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>loving heart, an exalted sense of duty, astonishing powers of work,
an im- posing presence and exceptional charm;… a true mother of her
people.” 5 She was the soul of kindness to all who did not attack her
empire or her faith; note her warm reception of the Mozart family in
1768. 6 She was a good mother to her children; her letters to them are
models of tenderness and wise counsel; had Joseph listened to her he
might not have died a failure; had Marie Antoinette followed her advice
she might have escaped the guil- lotine.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa was not an “enlightened despot.” She was no despot; Vol
- taire thought “she established her reign in all hearts by an
affability an d popularity which few of her ancestors had ever
possessed; she banished form and restraint from her court;… she never
refused audience to anyone, and no person ever departed from her
presence dissatisfied.” 7 She was far from enlightened in Voltaire’s
sense; she issued intolerant decrees against Jews and Protestants, and
remained a devout Catholic to the end. She saw with tremors the
infiltration of religious skepticism into Vienna from Lon- don and
Paris; she tried to stem the tide by a fervent censorship of books and
periodicals, and she forbade the teaching of English “because of the
dangerous character of this language in respect of its corrupting
religious and ethical principles.” 8</p>
<p>And yet she was not untouched by the anticlericalism of her
councilors and her son. They pointed out that the territorial and other
wealth of the clergy was rapidly increasing through priestly suggestions
that moribund pa- tients might expiate their sins and propitiate God by
bequeathing property to the Church; at this rate the Church — already a
state within a state — must soon be master of the government. Convents
and monasteries were multiply- ing, removing men and women from active
life, and excluding more and more property from taxation. Young women
were being induced to take conventual vows before they were old enough
to realize the significance of these lifelong dedications. Education was
so completely controlled by the clergy that every growing mind was being
molded into giving its supreme allegiance to the Church rather than to
the state. The Empress so far yielded to these arguments as to order
some substantial reforms. She forbade the presence of ecclesiastics at
the making of wills. She reduced the number of religious establishments,
and ordered the taxation of all religious property. No vows were to be
taken by persons under twenty-one years of age. Churches and convents
were no longer to afford asylum to criminals by “right of sanctuary.” No
papal brief was to be recognized in the Austrian realm until it had
received Imperial consent. The Inquisition was subjected to governmental
supervision, and was in effect suppressed. Education was reorganized
under the directio n of Gerhard van Swieten (the Queen’s phy - sician)
and Abbot Franz Rautenstrauch; in many professorships Jesuits were
replaced by laymen; 9 the University of Vienna was brought under laic
ad- ministration and state control; the curriculum there and elsewhere
was re- vised to widen instruction in science and history. 10 So the
pious Empress anticipated in some measure the ecclesiastical reforms of
her skeptical son.</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>She was a model of morality in an age when the courts of Christendom
rivaled Constantinople in polygamy. The Church might have used her as an
argument for orthodoxy, except that Augustus III, the Catholic King of
Po- land, and Louis XV of France were the most avid pluralists of all.
The Vien- nese aristocracy did not follow her example. Count Arco fled
to Switzerland with his mistress; Countess Esterhazy eloped to France
with Count von der Schulenburg; Prince von Kaunitz took his current
mistress with him in his coach, and when the Empress remonstrated he
told her, “Madame, I have come here to speak about your affairs, not
mine.” 11 Maria Theresa looked with disgust upon this laxity, and issued
Draconic decrees to enforce the Sixth Commandment among the people. She
ordered that women’s skirts should be lengthened at the bottom and
blouses at the top. 12 She organized a corps of Chastity Commissioners
empowered to arrest any woman sus- pected of prostitution. Casanova
complained that “the bigotry and narrow - mindedness of the Empress made
life difficult, especially for foreigners.” 13</p>
<p>A great part of her success as a ruler was due to her able ministers.
She accepted their lead and earned their devotion. Prince von Kaunitz,
despite the failure of his “reversal of alliances,” remained in charge
of foreign affairs, and served the Empire well for forty years. Ludwig
Haugwitz transformed internal administration, and Rudolf Chotek
reorganized the economy. These three men did for Austria what Richelieu
and Colbert had done for France; in effect they created a new state,
immeasurably stronger than the disordered realm that Maria Theresa had
inherited.</p>
<p>Haugwitz began by rebuilding the Imperial army. He believed that this
had collapsed in the face of Prussian discipline because it was composed
of independent units raised and commanded by semi-independent nobles; he
proposed and created a standing army of 108,000 men under unified
training and central control. To finance this force he recommended that
nobles and clergy, as well as commoners, be taxed; nobles and clergy
protested; the Empress braved their wrath and laid upon them a property
and an income tax. Frederick praised his enemy as an administrator: “She
put her finances in such order as her predecessors had never attained,
and not only recouped by good management what she had lost by ceding
provinces to the Kings of Prussia and Sardinia, but she considerably
augmented her revenue.” 14 Haugwitz went on to co-ordinate the law, to
free the judiciary from domina- tion by the nobles, and to bring the
feudal lords under control by the central government. A new and unified
legal code, the Theresianische Halsgericht- sordnung, was proclaimed in
1768.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Chotek strove to invigorate the sluggish economy. Industry
was hampered by monopolies that favored nobles, and by guild regulations
which remained in force till 1774; nevertheless Linz had woolen mills
with a total of 26,000 employees, Vienna excelled in glass and
porcelain, and Bohe- mia led the Empire in metallurgical operations.
Both Austria and Hungary had productive mines; Galicia had great salt
deposits, and Hungary mined seven million gulden’ worth of gold per
year. Chotek protected these in- dustries with tariffs, for Austria,
frequently at war, had to be made self-sufE-</p>

<p>cient in necessary goods; free trade, like democracy, is a luxury of
security and peace.</p>
<p>Even so, the Empire remained agricultural and feudal. Like Frederick,
the Empress, facing war, dared not risk social disruption by attacking
the en- trenched nobility. She gave a good example by abolishing serfdom
on her own lands, and she imposed upon the haughty magnates of Hungary a
decree empowering the peasant to move, marry, and bring up his children
as he liked, and to appeal from his lord to the county court. 15 Despite
these mitiga- tions the peasantry in Hungary and Bohemia was almost as
poor as in Russia. In Vienna the lower class lived in traditional
poverty, amid lordly palaces, elaborate operas, and magnificent churches
dispensing hope.</p>
<p>Vienna was beginning to rival Paris and its environs in royal
splendor. Schonbrunn (“Beautiful Spring”), just outside the city,
included 495 acres of gardens, laid out (1753-75) in emulation of
Versailles, with straight tow- ering hedges, fanciful grottoes,
symmetrical ponds, lovely statues by Donner and Beyer, a “Menagerie,” a
botanical garden, and , on a hill in the back- ground, a “Gloriette”
built in 1775 by Johann von Hohenberg— a colonnaded arcade in chaste
Romanesque. The Schonbrunn palace itself, an immense congeries of 1,441
rooms, had been designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in 1695,
but had been left unfinished in 1705; Maria Theresa en- gaged Niccolo
Pacassi to remodel it; work was resumed in 1744, and was completed in
the year of the Empress’ death (1780). Within was a Great Gallery 141
feet long, with a rococo ceiling painted by Gregorio Guglielmi (1761).
Schonbrunn housed the court from spring till fall.</p>
<p>The court numbered now some 2,400 souls. Two hundred and fifty stew-
ards and grooms were needed to care for the horses and carriages.
Altogether the maintenance of the palace and its grounds cost 4,300,000
gulden per year. 16 The Empress herself practiced economy, and excused
the splendor of her palace as necessary to the histrionics of royal
rule. She offset the luxury of her court with the extent of her
charities. A generation later Mme. de Stael reported of Austria: “The
charitable elements there are regulated with great order and liberality;
private and public beneficence is directed with a fine spirit of
justice… Everything in this country bears the mark of a parental, wise,
and religious government.” 17</p>
<p>Despite poverty there was hardly any begging, and relatively little
crime. 18 The people found their simple pleasures in exchanging visits,
rubbing elbows in the squares, cooling their heat in shady parks,
promenading on the tree- lined Hauptallee of the Prater, picnicking in
the countryside, or, at their lowest, thrilling to ferocious fights
arranged between famished animals. Pret- tier were the dances, and,
above all, the formal minuet; in this the man and the woman rarely
touched each other, every movement was governed by tradition and rule,
and was performed with restraint and grace. Music was so large a part of
Viennese life that it commands a chapter to itself.</p>
<p>By comparison literature was mediocre and immature. Austria, sacerdo-
tally controlled, had no share in the Sturm und Drang movement that
excited Germany. Maria Theresa was no patron of learning or
belles-lettres. There</p>
<p>34 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>were no literary salons in Vienna, no mingling of authors, artists,
and philos- ophers with women, nobles, and statesmen as in France. It
was a static soci- ety, with the charm and comfort of old and calculable
ways, saved from the turmoil of revolution but missing the zest of
challenging ideas. The Viennese newspapers, carefully censored, were
dull impediments to thought, perhaps excepting the Wiener Zeitung,
founded in 1780. The Viennese theaters were given to opera for the
aristocracy and the court, or to coarse comedies for the general public.
Leopold Mozart wrote that “the Viennese public, as a whole, has no love
of anything serious or sensible; they cannot even under- stand it; and
their theaters furnish abundant proof that nothing but utter trash, such
as dances, burlesques, harlequinades, ghost tricks, and devil’s an -
tics will go down with them.” 19 But Papa Mozart had been disappointed
with V ienna’s reception of his son.</p>
<p>Over this medley of actors, musicians, populace, serfs, barons,
courtiers, and ecclesiastics the great Empress ruled with maternal
watchfulness and solicitude. Her consort, Francis of Lorraine, had been
crowned emperor in 1745, but his talents inclined him to business rather
than government. He organized manufactures, provided the Austrian armies
with uniforms, horses, and arms, sold flour and provender to Frederick
while Frederick was at war with Austria (1756), 20 and left the
management of the Empire to his wife. Matrimonially, however, he
insisted on his rights, and the Empress, loving him despite his
adulteries, 21 bore him sixteen children. She brought them up with love
and severity, scolded them frequently, and gave them such doses of
morality and wisdom that Marie Antoinette was glad to escape to
Versailles, and Joseph flirted with philosophy. She plotted skillfully
to secure cozy berths for her other offspring: she made her daughter
Maria Carolina queen of Naples, her son Leopold grand duke of Tuscany,
her son Ferdi- nand governor of Lombardy. She devoted herself to
preparing her eldest son, Joseph, for the formidable responsibilities
that she would bequeath to him; and she watched with anxiety his
development through education and mar- riage, through the storms of
philosophy and the bereavements of love, to the time when, in a
transport of affection and humility, she raised him up, aged
twenty-four, to sit beside her on the Imperial throne.</p>
<p>in. Joseph growing: 1741-65</p>
<p>She had entrusted his education to the Jesuits, but, anticipating
Rousseau, she had asked that he be taught as if he were amusing himself.
22 When he was four years old she com plained that “my Joseph can’t
obey”; 23 obedience was not amusing. “He has already a high conception
of his station,” reported the Prussian ambassador when Joseph was six.
Maria Theresa resorted to discipline and enforced piety, but the boy
found religious observances irk- some, and resented the importance
attached to the supernatural world; this one, being in part his
patrimony, sufficed. He soon tired of orthodoxy, and discovered the
fascination of Voltaire. Otherwise he cared little for litera-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>ure, but he took eagerly to science, economics, history, and
international law. He never outgrew his boyhood haughtiness and pride,
but he developed into a handsome and alert youth, whose faults did not
yet alienate him from his mother. On his travels he wrote to her letters
of warm filial tenderness.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty he was made a member of the Staatsrath, or State
Council. Soon (1761) he drew up, and submitted to his mother, a paper
out- lining his ideas on political and religious reform; these remained
the essence of his policies to the end of his life. He advised the
Empress to extend reli- gious toleration, to reduce the power of the
Church, to relieve the peasantry of feudal burdens, and to allow greater
freedom in the movement of goods and ideas. 24 He asked her to spend
less on the court and its ceremonies, and more on the army. Every member
of the government should work for his salary, and the nobles should be
taxed like anybody else. 25</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was learning another side of life. Louis XV, as part of
the reversal of alliances, had offered his granddaughter Isabella of
Parma as a fit bride for the Archduke. Joseph seemed fortunate: Isabella
was eighteen, beautiful, and of good character except for a turn to
melancholy. In June, 1760, she came across the Alps in a caravan drawn
by three hundred horses; the marriage was celebrated with a sumptuous
feast, and Joseph was happy to have so fair a creature in his arms. But
Isabella took to heart the theology she had learned; dowered with all
the gifts of life, she found no joy in them, but longed for death.
“Death is beneficent,” she wrote to her sister in 1763. “Never have I
thought of it more than now. Everything arouses in me the desire to die
soon. God knows my wish to desert a life which insults Him every day….
If it were permitted to kill oneself I would already have done it.” 26
In November, 1763, she was stricken with smallpox; she gave no</p>
<p>A few months later he was taken by his father to Frankfurt-am-Main to
be crowned King of the Romans — the traditional step to the Imperial
throne. There, March 26, 1764 (young Goethe in the crowd), he was
elected, and on April 3 he was crowned. He did not enjoy the prolonged
ritual, the reli- gious services, the orations; he complained, in a
letter to his mother, of the “trash and idiocies which we had to listen
to all day…. It costs me great efforts to refrain from telling these
gentlemen to their faces how idiotically they act and talk.” Through it
all he kept thinking of the wife he had lost. “With my heart full of
pain I must appear as if enraptured…. I love soli - tude,… and yet I
must live among people…. I have to chatter all day and say p retty
nothings.” 27 He must have concealed his feelings well, for his brother
Leopold reported that “our King of the Romans is always charming, always
in good humor, gay, gracious, and polite, and he wins all hearts.”
28</p>
<p>On his return to Vienna he was informed that he must marry again; the
orderly continuity of the government seemed to require the continuity of
the Hapsburg family. Kaunitz chose a wife for him, josepha of Bavaria,
for Kaunitz was hoping to add Bavaria to the Austrian realm. Joseph
signed the proposal of marriage that Kaunitz had composed for him, sent
it off, and</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>wrote to the Duke of Parma (father of Isabella) a description of
Josepha as “a small squat figure without the charm of youth; pimples and
red spots on her face;… repulsive teeth…. Judge for yourself what this
decision has cost me…. Have pity on me, and do not fail in your love for
a son who, although he has another wife, has eternally buried in his
heart the image of his adored.” 29 Joseph and Josepha were married early
in 1765. She tried to be a good wife, but he abstained from her publicly
and privately. She suf- fered in silence, and died of smallpox in 1767.
Joseph refused to marry again. Now, with a tragic mixture of coldness
and devotion, of idealism and arro- gance, he gave the remainder of his
life to government.</p>

<li>MOTHER AND SON: 1765-80</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Emperor Francis I died (August 1 8, 1765) Maria Theresa was
for a time broken in body and mind. She joined his mistress in mourning
him; “My dear Princess,” she said, “we have both lost much.” 30 She cut
off her hair, gave away her wardrobe, discarded all jewelry, and wore
mourning till her death. She turned the government over to Joseph, and
spoke of retir- ing to a convent; then, fearful that her impetuous heir
should prove unfit to rule, she returned to public affairs, and signed
on November 17 an official declaration of co-regency. She kept supreme
authority over the internal affairs of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia;
Joseph, as emperor, was to have charge of foreign affairs and the army,
and, less fully, of administration and finance; but in foreign affairs
he accepted the guidance of Kaunitz, and in all fields his decisions
were subject to review by the Empress. His eagerness for power was
tempered by his respect and love for his mother. When (1767) she nearly
died of smallpox he seldom left her side, and astonished the court with
the depth of his anxiety and grief. These three attacks of the disease
upon the royal family at last persuaded the Austrian physicians to in-
troduce inoculation.</p>
<p>The loving son troubled his mother with the urgency of his ideas for
re- form. In November, 1765, he sent to the Council of State a
memorandum that must have startled its readers:</p>
<p>To retain more able men capable of serving the state, I shall decree
— what- ever the Pope and all the monks in the world may say — that none
of my sub- jects shall embrace an ecclesiastical career before… the age
of twenty-five. The sad results, for both sexes, often caused by early
vows should convince us of the utility of this arrangement, quite apart
from reasons of state….</p>
<p>Religious toleration, a mild censorship, no prosecution for morals,
and no espionage in private affairs should be maxims of government….
Religion and morals are unquestionably among the principal objects of a
sovereign, but his zeal should not extend to correcting and converting
foreigners. In faith and morals violence is unavailing; conviction is
needed. As for the censorship, we should be very careful about what is
printed and sold, but to search pockets and trunks, especially of a
foreigner, is an excess of zeal. It would be easy to prove that, despite
the now vigorous censorship, every prohibited book is now avail-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>able at Vienna, and everyone, attracted by the veto, can buy it at
double the price….</p>
<p>Industry and commerce are to be prompted through the prohibition of
all foreign goods except spices, through the abolition of monopolies,
the establish- ment of schools of commerce, and an end to the notion
that the pursuit of busi- ness is incompatible with aristocracy….</p>
<p>Liberty of marriage should be introduced, even of what we now call
mesal- liances. Neither the divine law nor the law of nature forbids it.
Only prejudice makes us believe that I am worth more because my
grandfather was a count, or because I possess a parchment signed by
Charles V. From our parents we in- herit only physical existence; thus
king, count, bourgeois, peasant, it is exactly the same. 81</p>
<p>Maria Theresa and the councilors must have smelled the breath of
Voltaire or the Encyclopedic in these proposals. The young Emperor had
to proceed slowly, but he advanced. He transferred to the Treasury
twenty million gulden — in cash, shares, and property — bequeathed him
in his father’s will, and he refunded the national debt at a charge of
only four instead of six per cent. He sold the hunting preserves of the
late Emperor, and ordered the slaughter of the wild boars that had
served as targets for the hunters and as destroyers of peasant crops.
Over the protests of nobles, but with the approval of his mother, he
opened the Prater and other parks to the public. 32</p>
<p>In 1769 he shocked Empress and court by going to Neisse, in Silesia,
and spending three days (August 25- 27) in friendly discussion with
Austria’s most hated enemy, Frederick the Great. He had taken from the
King of Prussia the conception of a monarch as “the first servant of the
state.” He admired Frederick’s subordination of Church to state, and
toleration of reli - gious varieties; he envied the Prussian military
organization and law reform. Both men felt that it was time to sink
their differences in a protective accord against the rising strength of
Russia. Joseph wrote to his mother: “After supper… we smoked, and talked
about Voltaire.” 33 The King, now fifty - seven, formed no high opinion
of the Emperor, now twenty- eight. “The young prince,” he wrote,
“affected a frankness which suited him well…. He is desirous of
learning, but he has had no patience to instruct himself. His exalted
position makes him superficial…. Boundless ambition devours him…. He has
enough taste to read Voltaire and appreciate his merits.” 34 The
alarming success of Catherine II in Russia led Kaunitz to arrange a
second conference with Frederick. King, Emperor, and Prince met at Neu-
stadt, in Moravia, September 3-7, 1770. Joseph must have developed
consid- erably during the year, for Frederick now wrote to Voltaire:
“Brought up in a bigoted court, the Emperor has discarded superstition;
reared in splendor, he has adopted simple manners; fed with incense, he
is modest; eager for glory, he sacrifices his ambitions to filial duty.”
35</p>
<p>These two meetings were part of Joseph’s education in politics. He
added to it by visiting his dominions and examining their problems and
possibilities at first hand. He went not as an emperor but as a common
traveler, on horse- back. He avoided ceremonies, and put up at inns
instead of chateaux. Visit- ing Hungary in 1764 and 1768, he noted the
extreme poverty of the serfs,</p>
<p>35 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>and was shocked by seeing, in a field, the corpses of children who
had died of hunger. In 1771-72 he saw similar conditions in Bohemia and
Moravia; everywhere he heard reports, or saw evidence, of brutal
landlords and starv- ing serfs. “The internal situation,” he wrote, “is
incredible and indescribable; it is heartbreaking.” 36 Returning to
Vienna, he fumed at the trifling improve - ments contemplated by the
Empress’s councilors. “Petty reforms will not do,” he said; “the whole
must be transformed.” He proposed, as a first step, to take over some
ecclesiastical lands in Bohemia and build upon them schools, asylums,
and hospitals. After much argument he persuaded the Council to issue
(1774) an “Urbarian Law” reducing and r egulating the amount of serf
labor (which the Bohemians called robota) due to a feudal lord. The
lords of Bohemia and Hungary resisted; the Bohemian serfs rose in
disorderly revolt, and were put down by the military. Maria Theresa
blamed her son for th e turmoil. To her agent in Paris, Mercy
d’Argentau, she wrote:</p>
<p>The Emperor, who pushes his popularity too far, has on his various
trips talked too much… about religious liberty and peasant emancipation.
All this has caused confusion in all our German provinces…. It is not
only the Bohemian peasant that is to be feared, but also the Moravian,
the Styrian, the Austrian; even in our section they dare indulge in the
greatest impertinences. 37</p>
<p>The strain between son and mother increased when (1772) Joseph joined
Frederick and Catherine II in the first partition of Poland. She
protested against this rape of a friendly (and Catholic) nation; she
wept when Joseph and Kaunitz prevailed upon her to add her signature to
the agreement, which gave a sector of Poland to Austria. Frederick
commented cynically, “Elle pleure, mats elle prend” (She weeps, but she
takes). 38 Her regret was sincere, as we see from her letter to her son
Ferdinand: “How often did I strive to dissociate myself from an action
which sullies the whole of my reign! God grant that I shall not be held
responsible for it in another world. It weighs upon my heart, tortures
my brain, and embitters my days.” 39</p>
<p>She contemplated the character of her s on with fear and love. “He
likes respect and obedience, regards opposition as distasteful and
almost intoler- able,… and is often inconsiderate…. His great and
growing vivacity results in a vehement desire to get his way in every
detail…. My son has a good heart.” Once she reproached him bitterly:</p>
<p>When I am dead I flatter myself that I will live on in your heart, so
that the family and the state will not lose by my death…. Your imitation
[of Fred- erick] is not flattering. This hero,… this conqueror — does he
have a single friend?… What a life, when there is no humanity! No matter
what your talents may be, it is not possible that you have already
experienced everything. Beware of falling into spitefulness! Your heart
is not yet evil, but it will become so. It is time to no longer take
pleasure in all these bon mots, these clever con- versations whose only
aim is to ridicule others…. You are an intellectual coquet. You are only
a thoughtless imitator where you think you are an inde- pendent thinker.
40</p>
<p>Joseph revealed his side of the situation in a letter to Leopold:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>35 1</p>
<p>Our uncertainties here have reached a pitch you cannot imagine. Tasks
ac- cumulate daily, and nothing is done. Every day till five or six,
except for a quarter hour for a solitary meal, I am at work; yet nothing
happens. Trifling causes, intrigues of which I have long been the dupe,
block the way, and mean- while everything goes to the devil. I make you
a present of my position as eldest son. 41</p>
<p>He scorned the men who had grown old in the service of his mother.
Only Kaunitz supported him, but with irritating caution.</p>
<p>The aging Empress heard with trepidation the revolutionary ideas of
her son. She told him frankly:</p>
<p>Among your fundamental principles the most important are: (i) the
free exercise of religion, which no Catholic prince can permit without
heavy re- sponsibility; (2) the destruction of the nobility [by ending
serfdom]… ; and (3) the so frequently repeated [advocacy of] liberty in
everything…. I am too old to accommodate myself to such ideas, and pray
to God that my succes- sor will never try them…. Toleration,
indifferentism, are precisely the means to undermine everything….
Without a dominant religion what restraint is there? None. Neither the
gallows nor the wheel…. I speak politically, not as a Christian. Nothing
is so necessary and beneficial as religion. Would you al- low everyone
to act according to his fancy? If there were no fixed worship, no
subjection to the Church, where would we be? Fist law would be the
result…. I only wish that when I die I can join my ancestors with the
consolation that my son will be as great, as religious, as his
forefathers, and that he will give up his false arguments, the evil
books, and the contact with those who have seduced his spirit at the
expense of everything that is precious and sacred, only to establish an
imaginary freedom which could… only lead to universal de- struction.
42</p>
<p>But if there was one thing Joseph was eager for it was freedom of
religion. He may not have been an atheist, as some have thought, 43 but
he had been deeply affected by the literature of France. Already in 1763
a group of Austrian intellectuals had formed an Aufklarungspartei, or
Party of Enlight- enment. 44 In 1772 Gy orgy Bessenyei, of Hungary,
published in Vienna a play echoing the ideas of Voltaire; he accepted
conversion to Catholicism to please Maria Theresa, but he returned to
rationalism after her death. 45 Joseph doubtless knew the remarkable
book, De statu ecclesiae et legitima potestate romani pontificis (1763),
in which a prominent Catholic bishop, under the pseudonym of Febronius,
had reasserted the supremacy of general councils over the popes, and the
right of each national church to govern itself. The young Emperor saw in
the entrenched wealth of the Austrian Church a prin- cipal obstacle to
economic development, and in the ecclesiastical control of education the
main barrier to the maturing of the Austrian mind. In January, 1770, he
wrote to Choiseul:</p>
<p>As regards your plan for getting rid of the Jesuits, you have my
complete ap- proval. Don’t count too much on my mother; a close
attachment to the Jesuits is hereditary in the Hapsburg family….
However, you have a friend in Kaunitz, and he does what he likes with
the Empress. 46</p>
<p>Joseph seems to have used his influence in Rome to bring Clement XIV
to the final step, and he was well pleased by the papal abolition of the
order ( 1 7 7 3 ). 47</p>
<p>35 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Maria Theresa would have been shocked to see, from her son’s letters,
how far he had strayed into the camp of the philosophes. She did her
best to prevent the dissolution of the Society of Jesus, but Kaunitz
persuaded her to yield to the view of all the other Catholic powers. “I
am discon solate and in despair about the Jesuits,” she wrote to a
friend. “I have loved and hon - ored them all my life, and have never
seen anything in them but what was edifying.” 48 She delayed enforcement
of the papal bull by appointing a com - mission to study it. The
Austrian Jesuits had time to remove their cash, valu- ables, and papers
from the country. Jesuit property was confiscated, but the Empress saw
to it that the members of the order received pensions, clothing, and
diverse gifts.</p>
<p>Joseph’s obvi ous satisfaction over the suppression of the Jesuits
widened the gap between mother and son. In December, 1773, he broke
under the strain, and begged her to release him from all share in the
government. She was dismayed by so startling a proposal, and wrote him a
touching appeal for reconciliation:</p>
<p>I must admit that my abilities, face, hearing, and skill are rapidly
deteriorat- ing, and that the weakness which I have dreaded all my life
— indecision — is now accompanied by discouragement and lack of faithful
servitors. The alienation of yourself and Kaunitz, the death of my loyal
advisers, the irreligion, the de- terioration of morals, the jargon that
everybody uses, and which I do not un- derstand — all this is enough to
overwhelm me. I offer you my whole confidence, and ask you to call
attention to any mistakes I may make…. Help a mother who… lives in
loneliness, and who will die when she sees all her efforts and sorrows
gone to waste. Tell me what you wish and I will do it. 49</p>
<p>He was reconciled, and for a time the woman who had once fought Fred-
erick to a standstill agreed to co- operate with Frederick’s admirer and
pupil. Together they applied the confiscated property of the Jesuits to
educational reform. In 1774 they issued an “Allgemeine Schulordnung”
which effected</p>
<p>Collaboration of mother and son went on to abolish torture (1776).
But the entente was shattered by the events of the following year.
Joseph had long thought of visiting Paris — not to see the philosophes
and bask in the salons, but to study the resources, army, and government
of France, to see Marie Antoinette, and to strengthen the ties that so
loosely bound the ancient enemies in their frail entente. When Louis XV
died, and France seemed about to fall apart, Joseph wrote to Leopold: “I
am anxious for my sister;</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>she will have a difficult part to play.” 50 He arrived in Paris April
18, 17 77, and courted privacy by pretending to be Count von
Falkenstein. He advised the gay young Queen to abandon extravagance,
frivolity, and rouge; she listened impatiently. He tried and failed to
win Louis XVI to a secret alli- ance for checking the expansion of
Russia. 51 He moved quickly about the capital, and “in a few days he
learned more about it than Louis XVI would learn in all his life.” 52 He
visited the Hotel -Dieu and did not conceal his aston- ishment at the
inhuman mismanagement of that hospital. The people of Paris were
charmed, and the courtiers at Versailles were alarmed, to find the
loftiest monarch in Europe dressed like a simple citizen, speaking
French like a Frenchman, and meeting all classes with the most
unassuming manners. Of literary lights he sought out especially Rousseau
and Buffon. He joined a soiree at Mme. Necker’s, and met Gibbon,
Marmontel, and the Marquise du Deffand; it is a credit to him that he
was more embarrassed by her poise and fame than she by his exalted
state; blindness is a leveler, for dignities are half composed of garb.
He attended a session of the Parlement of Paris and a sitting of the
French Academy. The philosophes felt that here at last was the
enlightened ruler whom they had hoped for as the agent of a peaceful
revolution. — After a month in Paris Joseph left for a tour of the
provinces, traveling north to Nor- mandy, then along the west coast to
Bayonne, then to Toulouse, Montpellier, and Marseilles, then up the
Rhone to Lyons and east to Geneva. He passed through Ferney without
visiting Voltaire; he did not wish to offend his mother, or too openly
ally himself with a man who seemed a devil incarnate to the people of
Austria and the King of France.</p>
<p>He was anxious to appease his mother, for during his absence some ten
thousand Moravians had abandoned Catholicism for Protestantism, and Ma-
ria Theresa — or the Council of State — had reacted to this catastrophe
with measures recalling the anti-Huguenot dragonnades under Louis XIV.
The leaders of the movement were arrested, Protestant assemblies were
dispersed; persistent converts were drafted into the army and assigned
to hard labor, and their women were sent to workhouses. When Joseph
returned to Vienna he protested to his mother: “To reconvert those
people you make soldiers of them, send them to the mines, or use them
for public works…. I must positively declare… that whoever is
responsible for this order is the most infamous of your servants, who
deserves only my contempt, for he is both a fool and shortsighted.” 53
The Empress answered that not she but the Coun - cil of State had issued
the decrees; however, she did not retract them. A dele- gation of
Moravian Protestants came to see Joseph; Maria Theresa ordered their
arrest. The crisis between mother and son was reaching an impasse when
Kaunitz persuaded her to withdraw the decrees. The persecutions were
stopped; the converts were allowed to practice their new worship
provided it was done quietly in their homes. The conflict of the
generations paused.</p>
<p>It was resumed when, on December 30, 1777, Maximilian Joseph, elector
of Bavaria, died childless after a long and prosperous reign. In the
contest for the succession to his power the Elector Palatine, Charles
Theodore (Karl Theodor), was supported by Joseph II, on condition of
ceding a part of</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Bavaria to Austria; and Charles, duke of Zweibriicken, was supported
by Frederick the Great, who announced that he would resist any
acquisition of Bavarian territory by Austria. The Empress warned her son
against chal- lenging the yet invincible King of Prussia. Joseph ignored
her advice, Kau- nitz upheld him, and an Austrian force was sent into
Bavaria. Frederick di- rected his troops to enter Bohemia and take
Prague unless the Austrians evacuated Bavaria. Joseph led his main army
to the defense of Prague; the hostile hosts approached each other, and
another Austro-Prussian war seemed about to shed fratricidal blood.
Frederick, violating precedents and expecta- tions, avoided battle,
content to let his soldiers consume Bohemia’s crops; and Joseph, knowing
Frederick’s reputation as a general, hesitated to attack. He had hoped
that France would come to his aid, and he dispatched pleas to Marie
Antoinette. Louis XVI sent him fifteen million livres, but could do no
more, for France had signed (February 6, 1778) an alliance with the
revolt- ing American colonies, and had to be prepared for war with
England. Joseph fretted in camp, while hemorrhoids agitated him at one
end, and an enormous boil at the other.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa, with a last flurry of will, took matters into her own
hands, and secretly sent Frederick an offer of peace (July 12).
Frederick agreed to negotiate; Joseph submitted to his mother; Louis of
France and Catherine of Russia mediated. The Treaty of Teschen (May 13,
1779) solaced Joseph with thirty-four square miles of Bavaria, but
allotted all the rest of that elec- torate to Charles Theodore, so
uniting Bavaria and the Palatinate; Prussia was to receive Bayreuth and
Ansbach at the death of their childless ruler. Everyone claimed
victory.</p>
<p>This third crisis between the aging Frederick and the aging Empress
ex- hausted her life. She was only sixty-three in 1780, but she was
stout and asthmatic, and two wars, sixteen pregnancies, and incessant
worry had weak- ened her heart. In November she was caught in a heavy
rain while driving in an open carriage; she developed a bad cough, but
insisted on spending the next day at her desk, working; she had once
remarked, “I reproach myself for the time I consume in sleep.” 54
Finding it almost impossible to breathe</p>
<p>V. THE ENLIGHTENED DESPOT: 1780-90</p>
<p>After sincerely mourning a mother whose greatness he now realized,
Jo- seph felt free to be himself, and to put into operation his
burgeoning ideas for reform. He was absolute monarch over Austria,
Hungary, Bohemia, and the Southern Netherlands; his brother Leopold
obeyed him in Tuscany, his sister</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette would serve him in France. He felt deeply the
opportuni- ties that had come to him at the zenith of his life and
power.</p>
<p>What was he like? Forty years old, still in the prime of life, he was
quite handsome when he covered his bald head with a wig. He had an
alert, almost feverishly active mind, abreast of his time, but
insufficiently steadied by a knowledge of history and human character.
Always feeling the stinginess of time, he erred only through haste,
rarely through ill-will. Many stories tell of his sensitivity to the
misfortunes of others, of his readiness to remedy re- mediable wrongs.
55 He made himself as accessible to the people as his tasks allowed. He
lived simply, dressed like any sergeant, and shujined the purple robes
of kings. He was as free from mistresses as Frederick, and had no “Greek
friends”; his work was his absorbing love. Like Frederick, he w orked
harder than any of his aides. He had prepared himself conscientiously
for his responsibilities; he had traveled not for amusement and display,
but for ob- servation and study; he had examined the industries, arts,
charities, hospitals, courts, naval and military establishments of many
countries; he had looked with his own eyes at the peoples, classes, and
problems of his realm. Now he resolved, so far as one man could, to
realize the dreams of the philosophers. “Since I have come to the
throne, and wear the foremost diadem in the world, I have made
philosophy the lawgiver of my empire.” 56 Philosophers everywhere in
Europe looked at the great enterprise with eager expectations.</p>
<p>The first difficulty was to find aides who would share his dream.
Those whom he had inherited were nearly all of the upper classes whose
privileges would be clipped by his reforms. Kaunitz and van Swieten
supported him; two privy councilors, Qualtenburg and Gebler, and two
professors in the University of Vienna, Martini and Sonnenfels,
encouraged him; but below these men were bureaucrats mortised in habit,
comfortable in tradition, and automatically resisting change. Joseph,
too hurried to be courteous, treated these servitors as servants,
confused them with a cloud of orders, asked them to report on any
serious fault in their associates , 57 clogged them with ques-
tionnaires, and demanded of them labor as unremitting as his own. He
prom- ised them, and their widows, pensions after ten years of service;
they thanked him, resented his methods, and nursed their pride. Joseph’s
confidence in the justice of his aims led him to impatient intolerance
of criticism or debate. He wrote to Choiseul (now in easeful re
tirement): “Live happier than I can be. I have hardly known happiness,
and before I complete the course that I have set out for myself I shall
be an old man.” 58 He never lived to be old.</p>
<p>He put aside all thought of democracy. His people, he felt, were
unpre- pared for political judgment; with a few exceptions they would
adopt what- ever opinions were handed down to them by their masters or
their priests. Even a constitutional monarchy appeared unpromising; a
parliament like England’s would be a cl osed society of landlords and
bishops defying any basic change. Joseph took it for granted that only
an absolute monarchy could break the cake of custom and the chains of
dogma and protect the simple weak from the clever strong. So he took up
every problem personally, and issued directives covering every phase of
life. To promote compliance</p>
<p>35*5</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>with his orders he set up a system of espionage that soured his
benefactions.</p>
<p>It was part of his absolutism to raise by conscription a large
standing army independent of territorial magnates, manned by universal
conscription, and hardened by Prussian discipline. That army, he hoped,
would give strength to his voice in international affairs, and would
keep Frederick at a distance; perhaps (for our philosopher was somewhat
acquisitive) it would enable him to absorb Bavaria and drive the Turks
from the adjoining Balkans. He named a commission of jurists to reform
and codify the laws; after six years of labor it published a new civil
code of judicial procedure. Penalties were lightened, and capital
punishment was abolished. (In contemporary England a hundred crimes were
still considered capital.) Magic, witchcraft, and apostasy were no
longer punishable by law. Dueling was forbidden; to kill in a duel was
classified as murder. Marriage was made a civil contract; marriages
between Christians and non-Christians became legal; divorce could be
obtained from the civil authority. Magistrates were to be appointed only
after specific train- ing and after passing difficult examinations. Many
ecclesiastical courts were abolished. All persons were to be held equal
before the law. Aristocrats were shocked when one of their number was
exposed in a pillory and another was sentenced to sweep the streets.</p>
<p>Serfdom was abolished by a series of decrees, 1781-85. The right to
change residence or occupation, to own property, and to marry by mutual
consent was guaranteed to all, and special attorneys were provided to
protect the peasants in their new liberties. The barons lost criminal
jurisdiction over their tenants, but, lest baronial manors remain
unproductive, the lords could require some customary services from their
former serfs.</p>
<p>Convinced that guild regulations hampered economic development, Jo-
seph encouraged capitalist industry, but he opposed the multiplication
of machines for fear “it would deprive thousands of their livelihood.”
59 He exempted industrial workers from conscription, but they grumbled
at his reduction of workless holydays. He elevated merchants,
manufacturers, and bankers to aristocratic titles and national honors.
He abolished or reduced internal tolls, but retained high protective
tariffs on imports. Domestic manu- facturers, so shielded from foreign
competition, raised prices and produced shoddy goods. 60 Resenting the
tariffs, Prussia, Saxony, and Turkey closed their gates to the products
of the Empire; the Elbe, the Oder, and the Dan- ube lost some of their
trade. Joseph tried to increase overland traffic with Adriatic ports by
cutting a new road, the Via Josephina, through the Car- niolan Alps; he
set up an East India Company, and hoped to develop com- merce with the
Orient, Africa, and America through the free ports of Fiume and Trieste.
In 1784 he negotiated a commercial treaty with Turkey, but three years
later his war with Turkey closed the Danube’s exits to the Black Sea,
and the Danubian merchants followed one another into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To promote the circulation of capital he removed from the statutes
the old prohibition of interest, legalized loans at five per cent, and
raised a Jewish banker to the baronetcy. He offered state loans and
temporary monopolies to new enterprises. He adopted the physiocratic
idea of a single tax falling</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>only upon land, varying with location and fertility, and paid by
landowners great or small. The proposal required a survey of all the
lands of the Em- pire; this was carried out at a cost of 120,000,000
gulden, paid by the pro- prietors. The new law decreed that the peasant
was to keep seventy per cent of his produce or income, give twelve per
cent to the state, and divide the remainder between feudal dues and
ecclesiastical tithes; previously he had paid thirty-four per cent to
the state, twenty-nine per cent to the landlord, and ten per cent to the
Church, keeping only twenty-seven per cent for him- self. 61 The nobles
protested that this new division would ruin them; in Hun- gary they rose
in revolt.</p>
<p>The population of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia rose from 18,700,000
in 1780 to 2 1,000,000 in 1790. 62 A contemporary reported that brick
cottages were replacing the old rural hovels, and that brick was
replacing wood in urban housing. 63 Poverty remained, but an Imperial
rescript of 1781 estab- lished Armeninstitute (Institutes for the Poor)
where any person unable to earn a living could claim support without
sacrificing his self-respect.</p>
<p>Though Joseph was officially “Vicar of Christ,” “Advocate of the
Chris - tian Church,” and “Protector of Palestine… and the Catholic
Faith,” he set about, soon after his rise to absolute power, to reduce
the role of the Church in his “hereditary” lands— i.e., Austria,
Hungary, and Bohemia. On October 12, 1781, he issued an Edict of
Toleration: Protestants and Greek Orthodox were to be free to have their
own temples, schools, and conven- tions, to own property, enter the
professions, and hold political or military offices. The Emperor
exhorted the people to “forbear all occasions of dispute relative to
matters of faith,… and to treat affectionately and kindly those who are
of a different communion.” 64 In a directive to van Swieten Joseph
frankly revealed the sources of his inspiration: “Intolerance is
banished from my Empire, [which can be] happy that it has not made
victims like Calas and Sirven…. Toleration is the effect of the
propagation of the enlighten- ment [les lumieres ] which has now spread
through all Europe. It is based on philosophy, and on the great men who
have established it…. It is philos- ophy alone that governments must
follow.” 65</p>
<p>There were limits to this toleration, as there had been in Voltaire’s
Treatise on Toleration (1763). Some councilors warned Joseph that if all
restraint were removed there would be a rank growth of wild creeds, even
of outright atheism, and that this would eventuate in warring sects,
social disorder, and the breakdown of all authority. So when he was told
that several hundred Bohemians had publicly declared themselves deists
(1783), he ordered that any man so professing “should, without further
investigation, be given twenty-four lashes on his buttocks with a
leather whip, and then be sent home,” and that this operation was to be
repeated as often as such public profession was renewed. 66 Some
persisting deists were transported to mili- tary colonies. We shall see
later how far Joseph went in his efforts to liberate the Jews.</p>
<p>One result of the Edict of Toleration was a rapid rise in the number
of professing Protestants in the realm, from 74,000 in 1781 to 157,000
in 1786.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Free thought grew, but remained confined to private circles. The
Free- masons, who had long been established in Austria, organized in
Vienna (1781) a lodge which was joined by many prominent citizens, and
(despite its implicit deism) was protected by the Emperor himself. “The
aim of the society,” said one member, “was to give effect to that
freedom of conscience and thought so happily fostered by the government,
and to combat super- stition and fanaticism in the… monkish orders,
which are the main sup- ports of these evils.” 67 Masonic lodges
multiplied to the number of eight in Vienna alone; it became fashionable
to belong; Masonic emblems were worn by both sexes; Mozart wrote music
for Masonic ceremonies. In time Joseph suspected the lodges of political
conspiracy; in 1785 he ordered the Viennese lodges to merge into two,
and allowed only one lodge in each provincial capital.</p>
<p>Joseph appointed a commission to revise the laws of censorship, and
in 1782 he promulgated its results in a new code. Books systematically
attack- ing Christianity, or containing “immoral utterances and unclean
obscenities,” were prohibited; but so too were books “containing
fabulous miracles, ap - paritions, revelations, and such things, which
would lead the common man to superstition, [and] arouse disgust in
scholars.” 68 Criticisms and lampoons were allowed, even if they
assailed the Emperor, but they must bear the au- thor’s real name, and
were subject to the law of libel. Books listed in the Roman Index
Librorum Prohibitorum were to be open to the use of scholars in
libraries. Scientific works were to be entirely exempt from censorship;
so were learned works, provided some recognized authority vouched for
their scholarly character. Books in a foreign language might be imported
and sold without hindrance. Academic freedom was enlarged. When fourteen
stu- dents at the University of Innsbruck denounced their teacher to the
au- thorities for contending that the world was older than six thousand
years, Joseph handled the matter summarily: “The fourteen students
should be dismissed, for heads so poor as theirs cannot p rofit from
education.” 69 — The new regulations elicited indignant protests from
the hierarchy; Joseph re- sponded by allowing Vienna complete liberty of
publication (1787). Even before this liberation the Viennese printers
took advantage of the lax en- forcement of the 1782 code: pamphlets,
books, and magazines flooded Aus- tria with semiobscenities,
“revelations” of nuns, and attacks upon the Catho - lic Church, or upon
Christianity itself.</p>
<p>Joseph felt that he should also regulate ecclesiastical affairs. On
November 29, 1781, he issued a decree that closed a great number of
monasteries and nunneries, such as “neither operate schools, nor care
for the sick, nor engage in studies.” Of 2,163 religious houses in the
German dominions (Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola) 413 were closed;
of their 65,000 inmates 27,000 were freed with pensions; and a similar
reduction was effected in Bohemia and Hungary. “The monarchy,” said
Joseph “is too poor and backward to allow itself the luxury of suppo
rting the idle.” 70 The wealth of the disman - tled institutions —
amounting to some sixty million gulden — was declared a patrimony of the
people, and was confiscated by the state. The surviving</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>monasteries were declared ineligible to inherit property. The
mendicant orders were commanded to cease begging, and were forbidden to
take nov- ices. Religious brotherhoods were abolished. All
ecclesiastical possessions were to be registered with the government,
which prohibited their sale, alienation, or exchange.</p>
<p>Joseph proceeded to bring the Catholic episcopate under state
control. New bishops were required to take an oath of obedience to the
secular au- thorities. No papal regulation or decree was to be valid in
Austria without the government’s permission. The papal bulls of 1362 and
1713, condemning heretics or Jansenists, were to be ignored. On the
other hand Joseph organ- ized new parishes, built new churches, and
provided stipends to support can- didates for the priesthood. He opened
new seminaries, and prescribed for them a curriculum stressing science
and secular knowledge as well as theol- ogy and liturgy.</p>
<p>These measures aroused the Catholic clergy throughout Europe. Many
prelates begged Joseph to rescind his anticlerical decrees; unheeded,
they threatened him with hell; he smiled and kept his course. Finally
the Pope himself, Pius VI, handsome, cultured, kindly, vain, took the
unusual step of leaving Italy (February 27, 1782), crossed the Apennines
and the Alps in winter, and arrived in Vienna (March 22) resolved to
make a personal plea to the Emperor; this was the first time since 1414
that a pope had set foot on German soil. Joseph, with his fellow skeptic
Kaunitz, went out from the city to escort the pontiff to the apartments
that had been used by Maria Theresa. During the Pope’s stay in Vienna
immense crowds gathered almost daily be - fore the royal palace to seek
the papal blessings. Joseph later described them:</p>
<p>All the passages and stairs of the court were crammed with people;
despite redoubled sentries it was impossible to protect oneself from all
the things they brought him to be blessed: scapularies, rosaries,
images. And for the benedic- tions which he gave seven times daily from
the balcony he had a throng of people so great that one can form no idea
of it unless one has seen it; it is no exaggeration to say that at one
time there were at least sixty thousand souls. That was a most beautiful
spectacle; peasants and their wives and children came from twenty
leagues around. Yesterday a woman was crushed right beneath my window.
71</p>
<p>Joseph was moved less by the Pope’s eloquent exhortations than by
this evidence of religion’s power on the human mind; nevertheless he
continued to close monasteries, even while Pius was his guest. 72 The
Pope warned him prophetically: “If you persevere in your projects,
destructive of the faith and the laws of the Church, the hand of the
Lord will fall heavily upon you; it will check you in the course of your
career, it will dig under you an abyss where you will be engulfed in the
flower of your life, and will put an end to the reign which you could
have made glorious.” 73 After a month of honors and failure Pius
returned sadly to Rome. Shortly afterward the Emperor ap- pointed as
archbishop of Milan a Visconti unacceptable to the Curia; the Pope
refused confirmation, and Church and Empire neared a break. Joseph was
not ready for so drastic a step. He hurried to Rome (December,
1782),</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>visited Pius, professed piety, and won papal consent to the
appointment of bishops — even in Lombardy — by the state. Prince and
prelate parted amicably. Joseph scattered thirty thousand scudi among
the Roman mob, and was hailed with grateful cries of “Viva nostro
Imperatore!”</p>
<p>Back in Vienna, he continued his one-man Reformation. Having defied
the Pope like Luther (with whom many Protestants gratefully compared
him), and having attacked the monasteries like Henry VIII, he proceeded
like Calvin to cleanse churches by ordering the removal of votive
tablets and most statuary, and by stopping the touching of pictures, the
kissing of relics, the distribution of amulets… He regulated the length
and number of reli- gious services, the clothing of the Virgin, the
character of church music; the litanies were hereafter to be recited in
German, not Latin. Pilgrimages and processions were to require the
consent of the secular authorities; ultimately only one procession was
allowed — for Corpus Christi Day; the people were officially informed
that they need not kneel in the streets before a procession, even if it
carried a consecrated Host; it was enough to doff their hats. Uni-
versity professors were told that they need no longer swear belief in
the immaculate conception of the Virgin.</p>
<p>No one could question the humanity of Joseph’s aims. The wealth taken
from dispensable monasteries was set apart for the support of schools,
hospi- tals, and charities, for pensions to displaced monks and nuns,
and for sup- plementary payment to poor parish priests. The Emperor
issued a long series of ordinances for the promotion of education. All
communities containing a hundred children of school age were required to
maintain elementary schools; elementary education was made compulsory
and universal. Schools for girls were provided by convents or the state.
Universities were supported at Vienna, Prague, Lemberg, Pest, and
Louvain; those at Innsbruck, Briinn, Graz, and Freiburg were made into
lycees to teach medicine, law, or prac- ti cal arts. Medical schools
were established, including the “Josephinum” at Vienna, for military
medicine and surgery. Vienna began to be one of the most advanced
medical centers in the world.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>The difficulty of Joseph’s revolutionary enterprise was doubled by
the diversity of his realm. He knew Austria well, but, despite arduous
travels, he had not realized how deeply entrenched were the Hungarian
magnates in the economic and political life of their nation, and how the
patriotism of the Hungarian masses could outweigh class interests. On
acceding to power he had refused to follow tradition and go to Pressburg
to be crowned king of Hun- gary, for in that ceremony he would be
required to swear allegiance to the Hungarian constitution, which
sanctioned the feudal structures of so- ciety. He had offended every
Hungarian by ordering the crown of Hun- gary’s patron St. Stephen to be
removed from Buda to Vienna (1784). He had replaced Latin with German,
not Magyar, as the language of law and</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>instruction in Hungary. He had angered Hungarian businessmen by
imped- ing with tariffs the export of their products into Austria. He
had shocked the Catholic Church by interfering with traditional rituals,
and by allowing Hungarian Protestant communities to multiply from 272 to
758 in one year (1783-84). Hungary fell into a turmoil of conflicting
classes, nationalities, languages, and faiths.</p>
<p>In 1784 the peasants of Wallachia (between the Danube and the
Transyl- vanian Alps) broke out in a violent Jacquerie against their
feudal lords, set fire to 182 baronial chateaux and sixty villages,
slaughtered four thousand Hun- garians, 74 and announced that they were
doing all this with the blessing of the Emperor. Joseph sympathized with
their resentment of long oppression, 75 but he was seeking to end
feudalism peaceably by legislation, and could not allow the peasants to
rush matters by arson and murder. He sent troops to put down the
insurrection; 1 50 leaders were executed, and the rebellion halted. The
nobles blamed him for the uprising, the peasants blamed him for its
fail- ure. The stage was set for national revolt against the Emperor in
1787.</p>
<p>In November, 1780, Joseph came in person to study the problems of the
Austrian Netherlands. He visited Namur, Mons, Courtrai, Ypres, Dunkirk,
Ostend, Bruges, Ghent, Audenaarde, Antwerp, Malines, Louvain, Brussels.
He made a side trip into the United Netherlands — to Rotterdam, The
Hague, Leiden, Haarlem, Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Spa (where he dined with
the philosophe Raynal). He was struck by the contrast between the
prosperity of Holland and the relative stagnation of the Belgian
economy. He at- tributed this to the activity and opportunities of Dutch
businessmen, and to the closing of the River Scheldt to oceanic trade by
the Treaty of Munster (1648). He returned to Brussels, and entered into
conferences seeking to im- prove commerce, administration, finance, and
law. In January, 1781, he ap- pointed his sister Maria Christina and her
husband, Duke Albert of Saxe- Teschen, governors of the Austrian
Netherlands.</p>
<p>Now for the first time he perceived how opposed to his reforms were
the traditional privileges of the upper classes in this historic land.
One province, Brabant, had a charter of liberties dating back to the
thirteenth century, and known as the Joyeuse Entree; any ruler entering
Brussels was expected to swear fidelity to this charter, and one clause
declared that if the sovereign violated any article his Flemish subjects
would have the right to refuse him all service and obedience. Another
clause required the sovereign to maintain the Catholic Church in all its
existing privileges, possessions, and powers, and to enforce all the
decisions of the Council of Trent. Similar constitutions were cherished
by the patricians and clergy in the other provinces. Joseph resolved not
to allow these traditions to defy his reforms. After a brief visit to
Paris (July, 1781) he returned to Vienna.</p>
<p>In November he began to apply to these provinces his Edict of
Toleration. He made the Belgian monasteries independent of the pope,
closed several of them, and confiscated their revenues. The bishops of
Brussels, Antwerp, and Malines protested; Joseph passed on to extend to
“Belgium” his regulations</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>on votive tablets, processions, and ritual. He withdrew control of
the- schools from the bishops, saying that “the children of Levi should
no longer have a monopoly on the human mind.” 76 He abrogated the
exclusive privileges long enjoyed by the University of Louvain. He
established there a new seminary free from episcopal dominance, and
ordered that all Belgian candidates for the priesthood should study for
five years in this institution. 77 Eager to im- prove provincial
government, he replaced (January, 1787) the provincial Estates, or
assemblies, and the old aristocratic privy councils, with a single
Council of General Administration under a plenipotentiary appointed by
the emperor; and he substituted a unified and secular judiciary for the
exist- ing feudal, territorial, and ecclesiastical courts. All persons,
of whatever class, were declared equal before the law.</p>
<p>The nobles and many bourgeois joined the clergy in resisting these
meas- ures. Their hostility was not appeased by the futile efforts that
Joseph made to reopen the Scheldt to oceanic commerce; Holland refused
to permit it, and France, despite the pleas of Marie Antoinette, joined
in the refusal. In January, 1787, the Estates of Brabant notified Joseph
that changes in the existing constitution of the province could not be
made without the consent of the Estates; in effect they informed him
that his rule in the Austrian Neth- erlands must be a constitutional,
not an absolute, monarchy. He ignored the declaration, and ordered the
enforcement of his decrees. The Estates refused to vote taxes unless
attention was paid to their remonstrances. Agitation flared into such
widespread violence that Maria Christina promised annul- ment of the
hated reforms (May 31, 1787).</p>
<p>Where was the Emperor during this turmoil? He was flirting diplomati-
cally with Catherine II, believing that an entente with Russia would
isolate Prussia and strengthen Austria against the Turks. Even before
the death of his mother Joseph had visited the Czarina at Mogilev (June
7, 1780), and thence he had gone on to Moscow and St. Petersburg. In
May, 1781, Austria and Russia signed an alliance that pledged each to
come to the aid of the other in case of attack.</p>
<p>Thinking that this agreement would immobilize the septuagenarian
Fred- erick, Joseph again (1784) offered the Austrian Netherlands to
Elector Charles Theodore in exchange for Bavaria. The Elector was
tempted, but Frederick roused all his energies to foil the plan. He
stirred up revolt against the Emperor in Hungary and Belgium; he induced
the Duke of Zweibriicken — heir to Bavaria — to oppose the exchange; he
sent agents to convince the German princes that their independence was
threatened by Austrian expan- sion; and he succeeded in organizing (July
23, 1785) Prussia, Saxony, Han- over, Brunswick, Mainz, Hesse-Cassel,
Baden, Saxe-Weimar, Gotha, Meck- lenburg, Ansbach, and Anhalt into a
Fiirstenbund, or League of Princes, pledged to resist any expansion of
Austria at the expense of a German state. Joseph again appealed to his
sister at Versailles; Marie Antoinette used her charm on Louis XVI to
win his support for her brother; Vergennes, foreign</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>363</p>
<p>minister, cautioned Louis against consent; Joseph confessed himself
defeated by the old fox who had been the idol of his youth. When, in
August, 1786, he received news of Frederick’s death, he expressed a
double grief: “As a sol - dier I regret the passing of a great man who
has been epoch-making in the art of war. As a citizen I regret that his
death has come thirty years too late.” 78</p>
<p>Now the Emperor’s only hope of extending his realm lay in joining
Cath - erine in a campaign to divide between them the European
possessions of Tur- key. When the Empress of Russia set out in January,
1787, to visit and awe her new conquests in the south, she invited
Joseph to meet her en route and accompany her to the Crimea. He went,
but did not at once agree to her proposal for a united crusade. “What I
want,” he said, “is Silesia, and war with Turkey will not give me that.”
79 Nevertheless, when Turkey declared war against Russia (August 15,
1787) Joseph’s hand was forced; his alliance with Catherine required him
to help her in a “defensive” war; besides, now that Turkey was so
critically engaged, Austria had a chance to regain Serbia and Bosnia,
perhaps even a port on the Black Sea. So, in February, 1788, Jo- seph
sent his soldiers to war, and told them to take Belgrade.</p>
<p>But meanwhile the Swedes seized the opportunity to send a force
against St. Petersburg. Catherine summoned troops from the south to
defend her capital. The Turks, relieved of Russian pressure,
concentrated their power against the Austrians. Joseph, going to lead
his army, saw it weakened by apathy, desertion, and disease; he ordered
a retreat, and returned to Vienna in despair and disgrace. He turned
over the command to Laudon, a hero of the Seven Years’ War; the old
Marshal redeemed Austrian arms by capturing Belgrade (1789). Sweden’s
sortie against Russia having failed, Catherine’s soldiers swarmed
backward to the south, and survived in slightly superior number in
competitive holocausts with the Turks. Joseph was rejoicing in the
prospect of long-awaited martial glory when Prussia, England, Sweden,
and Holland, fearing Russian aggrandizement, intervened to help the
Turks. Suddenly Joseph found nearly all of Protestant Europe united and
arming against him. Once more he appealed to France, but France, in
1789, was busy with revolution. Prussia, under Frederick William II,
signed an alliance with Turkey (January, 1790), and sent agents to
foment revolt against the Em- peror in Hungary and the Austrian
Netherlands.</p>
<p>Hungary welcomed these machinations, for it was in open rebellion
against Joseph’s edicts of conscription, taxation, language change, and
religious re - form. In 1786 Emerich Malongei called upon the Hungarians
to elect their own king. In 1788 Remigius Franyo organized a plot to
make Frederick William king of Hungary; Counts Esterhazy and Karolyi
betrayed the plot to the Emperor, and Franyo was sentenced to sixty
years’ imprisonment. In 1789 the Hungarian Estates appealed to Prussia
to free Hungary from Aus- tria. When news of the French Revolution
reached Hungary the country rang with cries for independence. Joseph,
who felt death in his veins, had no more strength to maintain his stand.
His brother Leopold urged him to yield. In January, 1790, he
announced:</p>
<p>364</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>We have decided to restore the administration of the Kingdom [of
Hungary]… to the status of 1 780…. We instituted [the reforms] out of
zeal for the common good, and in the hope that you, taught by
experience, would find them pleasing. Now we have convinced ourselves
that you prefer the old order…. But it is our will that our Edict of
Toleration,… as well as that con- cerning the serfs, their treatment and
their relation to the seigneurs, remain in force. 80</p>
<p>In February the crown of St. Stephen was carried back to Buda, and
was ac- claimed with public rejoicing at every stop on the way. The
revolt died down.</p>
<p>The revolt in the Austrian Netherlands went full course, for there it
felt the heat of the revolutionary movement in neighboring France.
Joseph re- fused to confirm the promise his sister had given to the
Estates of Brabant that the reforms they resented would be annulled; he
ordered their enforce- ment, and bade his soldiers fire upon any crowds
resisting them. It was so done; six rioters were killed in Brussels
(January 22, 1788), an unknown number in Antwerp and Louvain. A Brussels
lawyer, Henri van den Noot, summoned the people to arm themselves and
enroll as volunteers in an army of independence. The appeal was actively
supported by the clergy; an anom- alous inspiration was added by news
that the Bastille had fallen; soon ten thousand “Patriots,” ably led,
were in the field. On October 24 a manifesto of “the Brabantine people”
announced the deposition of Joseph II as their ruler. On October 26 a
force of Patriots defeated the Austrian soldiery. Town after town was
occupied by the insurgents. On January 1 1, 1790, the seven provinces
declared their independence, and proclaimed the Republic of the United
States of Belgium, taking the name of the Belgic tribes that had
troubled Caesar eighteen centuries before. England, Holland, and Prus-
sia were happy to recognize the new government. Joseph appealed to
France for help, but France herself was busy deposing her King. All the
old world that Joseph had known seemed to be falling apart. And death
was calling him.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ATRA MORS</li>
</ol>
<p>The bitterness of those final months was complete. Hungary and
Belgium were in revolt, the Turks were advancing, his army was mutinous,
his own people, the Austrians, who once had loved him, had turned
against him as the violator of their sacred customs and beliefs. The
priests denounced him as an infidel, the nobles hated him for freeing
their serfs, the peasants cried out for more land; the urban poor were
near starvation; all classes cursed the high taxes and prices caused by
the war. On January 30, 1790, in full surrender, Joseph rescinded all
reforms decreed since the death of Maria Theresa, ex- cept the abolition
of serfdom.</p>
<p>Why had he failed? He had accepted in full faith and generous trust
the thesis of the philosophes that a monarch of good education and good
will</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN AUSTRIA</p>
<p>3&lt;55</p>
<p>would be the best instrument of enlightenment and reform. He had a
good education, but his good will was tarnished by love of power, and
ultimately his eagerness to be a conqueror overcame his zeal for putting
philosophy on the throne. He lacked the philosopher’s capacity for
doubt; he took for granted the wisdom of his means as well as of his
ends. He tried to reform too many evils at once, and too hurriedly; the
people could not absorb the bewildering multiplicity of his decrees. He
commanded faster than he could convince; he sought to achieve in a
decade what required a century of edu- cation and economic change.
Basically it was the people who failed him. They were too deeply rooted
in their privileges and prejudices, in their cus- toms and creeds, to
give him the understanding and support without which, in such
challenging reforms, his absolutism was impotent. They preferred their
churches, priests, and tithes to his taxes, spies, and wars. They could
not put their trust in a man who laughed at their beloved legends,
badgered their bishops, and humiliated their Pope.</p>
<p>Through all those exacting years since 1765 his body had rebelled
against his will. His stomach could not digest his pace; repeatedly and
in vain it cau- tioned him to rest. The Prince de Ligne warned him that
he was killing him- self; he knew it, but “what can I do?” he said; “I
am killing myself because I cannot rouse up others to work.” 81 His
lungs were bad, his voice was feeble and hollow; he had varicose veins,
running eyes, erysipelas, hemorrhoids… He exposed himself to all kinds
of weather in the war with the Turks; like thousands of his troops he
contracted quartan fever. Sometimes he could hardly breathe; “my heart
palpitates at the slightest movement.” 82 In the spring of 1789 he began
to vomit blood — “almost three ounces at once,” he wrote to Leopold. In
June he had violent pains in the kidneys. “I observe the strictest diet;
I eat neither meat nor vegetables nor dairy products; soup and r ice are
my nourishment.” 83 He developed an anal abscess; this and his
hemorrhoids had to be lanced. He developed dropsy. He summoned Leopold
to come and take over the government. “I do not regret leaving the
throne,” he said; “all that grieves me is to have so few people happy.”
84 To the Prince de Ligne he wrote: “Your country has killed me. The
taking of Ghent was my agony; the loss of Brussels is my death…. Go to
the Low Countries; bring them back to their sovereign. If you cannot do
this, stay there. Do not sacrifice your interests to me. You have
children.” 85 He made his will, leav - ing generous gifts to his
servants, and to “the five ladies who bore my so - ciety.” 86 He
composed his own epitaph: “Here lies Joseph, who could suc - ceed in
nothing.” 87 He received with resignation the last sacrament of the
Catholic Church. He begged for death, and on February 20, 1790, it was
given him. He was forty-eight years old. Vienna rejoiced at his passing,
and Hungary gave thanks to God.</p>
<p>Was he a failure? In war, unquestionably. Despite Laudon’s victories
Leo - pold II (1790-92) found it advisable to make peace with Turkey

<p>Austria most of the reforms were preserved. The toleration edicts
were not repealed; the closed monasteries were not restored; the Church
remained sub- ject to the laws of the state. The economic legislation
had freed and stimu- lated commerce and industry. Austria passed without
violent revolution from a medieval to a modern state, and shared in the
diverse cultural vitality of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>“Deeply convinced of the integrity of my intentions,” Joseph had
written to Kaunitz, “I hope that when I am dead posterity— more
favorable, more impartial, and therefore juster than my contemporaries —
will examine my ac- tions and goals before judging m e.” 88 It has taken
posterity a long time to do this, but it has learned at last, while
deploring his autocracy and haste, to recognize in him the bravest and
most thoroughgoing, as well as the least judicious, of the “enlightened
despots.” After the re action under Metternich had passed away, the
reforms of Joseph II were one by one restored, and the revolutionaries
of 1848 laid a wreath of grateful acknowledgment upon his tomb.</p>
