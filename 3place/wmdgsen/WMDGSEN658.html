<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>The Scientific Quest</p>
<p>1648-1715</p>
<p>I. THE INTERNATIONAL OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>S LOWLY the mood of Europe, for better or for worse, was changing
from supematuralism to secularism, from theology to science, from hopes
of heaven and fears of hell to plans for the enlargement of knowledge
and the improvement of human life. The upper classes, pursuing their
epicurean ways, made little protest against a religious faith which they
conceived to be salutary for the unfortunate masses excluded from the
paradise of pedigree; yet even among the gilded few there were some who
played at science, balanced equations, burned their fingers or sniffed
their noses in laboratories, or gazed in puzzlement at the multiplying
stars. In Paris fashionable ladies crowded to Lemery’s lectures on
chemistry, to Du Vemey’ s demonstrations in anatomy; Conde invited
Lemery to his very exclusive salon, and Louis XIV appointed Du Verney to
aid in educating the heir to the throne. In England Charles II had a
“chimical laboratory” of his own; barons, bishops, and barristers
contrived experiments; elegant mistresses came in their carriages to
observe the marvels of magnetism; Evelyn dabbled in physics, and
proposed to establish an institute for scien- tific research; Pepys,
between ships and skirts, plied the microscope, the air pump, and the
dissecting knife, and became president of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>The universities lagged behind the public in the new interest, but
private academies took it up. First, apparently, the Academia Secretorum
Naturae at Naples ( 1 560) ; then the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome ( 1
603 ) , to which Galileo belonged; then the Accademia del Cimento which
his disciples Viviani and Torricelli founded at Florence (1657). This
last institute was dedicated by its name to experiment, and took
Cartesian doubt as its start- ing point; nothing was to be received on
faith; every problem was to be investigated without regard to any
existing sect or philosophy. 1 Some of these academies were short-lived,
but they left successors when they died. Academies were established at
Schweinfurt (1652), Altdorf (1672), and Uppsala (1710); in 1700, after
thirty years of pleading by Leibniz, the Berlin Academy took form; and
to Leibniz’ credit we must ascribe also the Academy of St. Petersburg
(1724).</p>
<p>49&lt;S the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XVIII</p>
<p>In France the Academie des Sciences developed from the meetings</p>
<p>(1631-38) of Mersenne, Roberval, Desargues, and other scientists in
the home of Pascal’s father in Paris, or in Mersenne’s mon astic cell.
It formu- lated a program “to work for the perfection of the sciences
and the arts, and to seek generally for all that can be of use or
convenience to the human race”; it resolved also “to disabuse the world
of all those common errors that have long passed for truth,” but it
counseled its members to avoid discussion of religion or politics. 2 In
1666 the Academy received a royal charter, and a room in the
Biblioth&amp;que Royale; at Versailles we may still see a large canvas,
by Testelin, in which Louis XIV presents this charter to a group headed
by Christian Huygens and Claude Perrault. Each of the twenty-one members
received an annual salary from the government, and funds for expenses;
in effect the Academy became a department of the state. Louis was
especially kind to astronomers. He invited Cassini from Italy, Roemer
from Denmark, Huygens from Holland, and built for them a splendid
observatory. When Hevelius of Danzig, who had distinguished himself by
his studies of the moon, lost his precious library in a fire, the King
sent him a substantial gift to repair the loss. 3 Laplace credited the
Academie with most of the scientific advances made in France; but its
dependence upon a King closely allied with the Church proved detrimental
to the progress of French science, 4 and the English forged ahead.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of England that its scientific academies were
private foundations only incidentally indebted to the government. About
1645, according to John Wallis, he became acquainted in London with
“divers worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy and other
parts of human learning, and particularly . . . Experimental
Philosophy.” 8 They agreed to meet once a week to discuss mathematics,
astronomy, magnetics, navigation, physics, mechanics, chemistry, the
circulation of the blood, and other such subjects. This “Invisible
College,” as it was then called, took its inspiration from the House of
Solomon in Bacon’s New Atlantis. When Wallis removed to Oxford as
professor of mathematics, the association divided into two sections, one
of which met in the lodgings of Robert Boyle at the University, the
other in Gresham’s College, London; Wren and Evelyn were early members
there. The political turmoil intervening be- tween the death of Cromwell
and the Restoration interrupted these Lon- don meetings, but they were
resumed soon after the accession of Charles II; and on July 15, 1662,
the King conferred an official charter upon the “Royal Society of London
for Improving Natural Knowledge.” The</p>
<p>ninety- eight “original fellows” included not only scientists like
Boyle and Hooke, but poets like Dryden and Waller, Wren the architect,
Evelyn, fourteen peers, and several bishops. Between 1663 and 1686 some
three hundred additional fellows were enrolled. No class distinctions
divided</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>them; dukes and commoners rubbed elbows in the enterprise; and poor
members were exempt from dues. 6 In 1673 Leibniz, admitted to member-
ship, declared the Royal Society the most respected intellectual
authority in Europe. As early as 1667 Thomas Sprat published his
excellent History of the Royal Society ; he too, though he became bishop
of Rochester, was stirred by the Baconian breezes that were blowing over
England.</p>
<p>Some theologians complained that the new institute would undermine
respect for the universities and the Established Church, but the
moderation and caution of the Society soon calmed ecclesiastical
opposition. Its strange experiments amused the court and the King, who
laughed when he heard that it was weighing air and meditating mechanical
flight. Swift satirized it in Gulliver’s Travels 7 as the Grand Academy
of Lagado, whose members made plans for extracting sunshine from
cucumbers, and for building houses from the roof downward; and Samuel
Butler, author of Hudibras, told how a club of scientists was excited by
discovering an elephant in the moon, only to find that it was a mouse in
their telescope. 8 But it was under the auspices of the Royal Society
that Evelyn improved English husbandry, that Sir William Petty
established the science of statistics, that English science and medicine
advanced beyond anything known in contemporary France or Germany, that
Boyle almost founded chemistry, that Ray</p>
<p>revolutionized botany, Woodward geology, and Newton astronomy. The
Society made thousands of experiments in chemistry and physics; it re-
ceived, dissected, and studied the bodies of executed criminals; it
became a repository of clinical reports from physicians in all parts of
the country; it collected reports of technological developments; it kept
in touch with scientific research abroad. Its emphasis on natural
processes and law dis- credited superstition and the witchcraft
persecution.</p>
<p>In 1665 Henry Oldenburg, its secretary, began to publish The
Philo-</p>
<p>sophical Transactions of the Royal Society , which has continued to
our own day. It invited and received contributions from abroad; it was
among the first to print the findings of Malpighi and Leeuwenhoek.
Oldenburg had come to England in 1653 to negotiate a trade treaty for
his native Bremen; he remained, and became a friend of Milton, Hobbes,
Newton, and Boyle; he corresponded actively with scientists and
philosophers in all parts of the world. The members of the Royal
Society, he said, “have taken</p>
<p>We feel certain that the forms and qualities of things can best
be</p>
<p>explained by the principles of mechanics, and that all effects of
Nature are produced by motion, figure, texture, and the varying
combinations of these; and that there is no need to have recourse to
inexplicable</p>
<p>forms and occult qualities, as to a refuge from ignorance. 10</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Through these Philosophical Transactions , the Journal des savants ,
the Giornale de’ letterati, and the Acta Eruditorum the scientists and
scholars of Europe were able to overcome national boundaries, to keep in
touch with one another’s work and findings, and to form a united army of
advance in a vast creative enterprise. Almost hidden away in their
studies, laboratories, and expeditions, ignoring or surviving the
clatter of politics, the march of regiments, the din of dogma, the mists
of superstition, and the prying agents of civil or ecclesiastical
censorship, they pored over texts, test tubes, and microscopes, mingled
chemicals curiously, measured forces and magni- tudes, plotted equations
and diagrams, peered into the mysteries of the cell, burrowed into the
strata of the earth, charted the movements of the stars, until all the
motions of matter seemed to fall into an order of law, and the
overwhelming immensity of the universe seemed to obey the predic- tions
of the amazing human mind. In France Fermat, Pascal, Roberval, Mariotte,
Perrault, and whole families of Cassinis; in Switzerland the Bemoullis;
in Germany Guericke, Leibniz, Tschimhaus, Fahrenheit; in Holland Huygens
and Leeuwenhoek; in Italy Viviani and Torricelli; in Denmark Steno; in
Scotland James and David Gregory; in England Wallis, Lister, Boyle,
Hooke, Flamsteed, Halley, Newton: these and many others, in this bri ef
period of Europe’s history from 1 648 to 1715, labored apart and
together, solitary and conspiring, to build, day by day, night after
night, the mathematics, astronomy, geology, geography, physics,
chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology that were to effect a
fateful revolution in the modern soul. Oldenburg, feeling this
internationalism of science, and never dreaming that nationalism might
make science itself a partisan and cataclys- mic tool, saw in this
inspiring co-operation an omen of a be tter life. “I hope,” he wrote to
Huygens, “that in time all nations, even the less civilized, will
embrace each other as dear comrades, and will join forces, both intel-
lectual and material, to banish ignorance and to make true and useful
philosophy r egnant.” 11 It is still the hope of the world.</p>

<li>MATHEMATICS</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the new international sharpened its instruments. Pascal,
Hooke, and Guericke developed the barometer; Guericke’s air pump
explored the possibility of a vacuum; Gregory, Newton, and others made
better telescopes than those of Kepler and Galileo; Newton invented the
sextant; Hooke improved the compound microscope, which transformed the
study of the cell; the thermometer became more reliable and accurate
under Guericke and Amontons, and in 1714 Fahrenheit gave it its English-
Amer- ican form by using mercury instead of alcohol as the expanding
medium,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>and dividing its scale at zero, 32 degrees, and 96 degrees (which he
as- sumed to be the normal temperature of the human body).</p>
<p>The greatest instrument of all was mathematics, for this gave
experience a quantitative and measured form, and in a thousand ways
enabled it to predict, even to control, the future. “Nature plays the
mathematician,” said Boyle; and Leibniz added, “Natural science is
naught but applied mathematics.” 12 Historians of mathematics acclaim
the seventeenth cen - tury as especially fruitful in their field, for it
was the century of Descartes, Napier, Cavalieri, Fermat, Pascal, Newton,
Leibniz, and Desargues. Ladies perfumed with pedigree attended lectures
on mathematics; some of them, joked the Journal des savants , made the
squaring of the circle the sole passport to their favors; 13 th is may
explain Hobbes’s persistent efforts to solve that baffling problem.</p>
<p>Pierre de Fermat fathered the modem theory of numbers (the study of
their classes, characteristics, and relationships), conceived analytical
geome- try independently of — perhaps before — Descartes, invented the
calculus of probabilities independently of Pascal, and anticipated the
differential cal- culus of Newton and Leibniz. Yet he lived in
comparative obscurity as a counselor of the Parlement of Toulouse, and
formulated his contributions to mathematics only in letters to his
friends — which were not published till 1679, fourteen years after his
death. We catch the mathematical ecstasy in one of these letters: “I
have found a very great number of exceedingly beautiful theorems.” 14 He
was delighted by every new trick or surprising regularity in numbers. He
challenged the mathematicians of the world “to separate a cube into two
cubes, a fourth power into two fourth powers,” etc.; “I have
discovered,” he wrote, “a truly marvelous demonstration” of this, now
known as “Fermat’s last theorem”; but neither his nor any con - clusive
proof of it has yet been found. A German professor in 1908 left 100,000
marks to the first person who should prove Fermat’s proposition; no one
has yet claimed the reward, perhaps discouraged by the depreciation of
marks.</p>
<p>Christian Huygens, barring only one, was the outstanding scientist of
this age — facile secundus to Newton. His father, Constantijn Huygens,
wa s one of the most distinguished of Holland’s poets and statesmen. Bom
at The Hague in 1629, Christiaan (as the Dutch spelled him) began at the
age of twenty-two to publish mathematical treatises. His discoveries in
astronomy and physics soon won him a European renown; he was elected a
fellow of the Royal Society in London in 1663, and in 1665 he was in-
vited by Colbert to join the Academie des Sciences in Paris. He moved to
the French capital, received a liberal pension, and remained there till
1681; then, uncomfortable under a King turned persecutor of Protestants,
he returned to Holland. His correspondence in six languages with
Descartes,</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Roberval, Mersenne, Fermat, Pascal, Newton, Boyle, and many others
illustrated the growing unity of the scientific fraternity. “The world
is my country,” he said, and “to promote science is my religion.” 15 His
mens Sana in corpore aegro was one of the marvels of his time — his body
always ailing, his mind creative till his death at sixty-six. His work
in mathematics was the least part of his achievement; yet geometry,
logarithms, and calcu- lus all profited from his labors. In 1673 he
established that “law of inverse squares” (that the attraction of bodies
for one another varies inversely as the square of the distance between
them) which became so vital to New- ton’s astronomy.</p>
<p>Newton, of course, was now the central luminary in the galaxy of
British science; he deserves a separate chapter; but there were
satellites to his star. His friend John Wallis, an Anglican priest,
became Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford in 1649 at the age of
thirty-three, and held that chair for fifty-four years. Grammar, logic,
and theology diverted his pen from science; nevertheless he wrote
effectively on mathematics, mechanics, acoustics, astronomy, tides,
botany, physiology, geology, and music; he lacked only some amours and
wars to make him a full man. His De Algebra Tractatus Historicus et
Practicus (1673) not only contributed original ideas to that science,
but was the first serious attempt in England to write the history of
mathematics. His contemporaries were delighted by his prolonged
controversy with Hobbes over the quadrature of the circle; Wal- lis
scored his point, but the old philosopher fought on to the end of his
ninety-first year. History remembers Wallis chiefly for his Arithmetica
Infinitorum (1655), which applied Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles to
the quadrature of curves, and so prepared for infinitesimal
calculus.</p>
<p>Calculus meant originally a small stone used by the ancient Romans in
calculating; but only the devotees of calculus can now define their
science properly.* Archimedes had glimpsed it, Kepler had approached it,
Fermat had discovered it but had not published his findings; Cavalieri
and Torricelli in Italy, Pascal and Roberval in France, John Wallis and
Isaac Barrow in England, James and David Gregory in Scotland, had all
carried bricks to the building in this astonishing co-operation of a
continent. Newton and Leibniz brought the work to fulfillment.</p>
<p>•For us who are not initiates, differential calculus may be described
as the calculation</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>501</p>
<p>The term calculus was suggested to Leibniz by Johann Bernoulli, mem-
ber of a family as remarkable as the Bachs, the Brueghels, and the
Couperins for the social heredity of genius. Nikolaus Bernoulli
(1623-1708), like his ancestors, was a merchant. In his son Jakob
Bernoulli I (1654-1705) mer- cantile accounting passed into higher forms
of reckoning. Taking as his motto Invito patre sidera verso — “Against
my father’s will I study the stars” — Jakob dabbled in astronomy,
contributed to analytical geometry, advanced the calculus of variations,
and became professor of mathematics at the University of Basel. His
studies of catenary curves (curves described by a uniform chain
suspended between two points) came to later fruition in the designing of
suspension bridges and high-voltage transmission lines. His brother
Johann (1667-1748), also against paternal plans, took up medicine, then
mathematics, and succeeded Jakob as professor at Basel; he contributed
to physics, optics, chemistry, astronomy, the theory of tides, and the
mathematics of sails; he invented exponential calculus, constructed the
first system of integral calculus, and introduced the use of the word
integral in this sense. Another brother, Nikolaus I (1662-1716), took
his doctor’s degree in philosophy at sixteen, in law at twenty, taught
law at Bern and mathematics in St. Petersburg. We shall find six more
Bernoulli mathematicians in the eighteenth century, and there were two
in the nine- teenth. By that time the Bernoulli battery had run
down.</p>
<p>The establishment of statistics as almost a science was among the
achieve- ments of this age. John Graunt, a haberdasher, amused himself
by collect- ing and studying the burial records of London parishes.
Usually these rec- ords stated the reported cause of death, including
“dead in the street and starved,” “executed and prest to death,” “King’s
evil,” “starved at nurse,” and “made away themselves.” 16 In 1662 Graunt
published his Natural and Political Observations . . . upon the Bills of
Mortality-, this is the beginning of modem statistics. He concluded from
his tables that thirty -six per cent of all children died before the age
of six, twenty-four per cent died in the next ten years, fifteen per
cent in the next ten, etc.; 17 the infantile mortality seems much
exaggerated here, but suggests the labor of love in keeping up with the
angel of death. “Among the several casualties,” said Graunt, “some bear
a constant proportion unto the whole number of burials; such are
chronical diseases, and the diseases whereunto the city is most subject,
as, for example, consumptions, dropsies, jaundice, etc.”; 18 i.e.,
certain diseases, and other social phenomena, though incalculable in
individuals, may be precalculated with relative accuracy for a large
community; this principle, here formulated by Graunt, became a
foundation of statistical prediction. He noted that in many years the
burials in London exceeded the christen- ings; he concluded that London
was especially rich in opportunities for death, as from business
anxieties, “smokes, stinks, close air,” and “intern -</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap, xvni</p>
<p>perance in feeding.” As the population of London grew nevertheless,
Graunt ascribed the increase to immigration from the countryside and the
lesser towns. He reckoned the population of the capital in 1662 at some
384,000 souls.</p>
<p>Statistics were applied to politics by Graunt’s friend Sir William
Petty.</p>
<p>Insurance companies used statistics to turn their business into an
art and science that took account of everything except inflation. From
the mortality reports of Breslau Edmund Halley drew up (1693) a table of
expectable deaths for all years between one and eighty-four; on its
basis he calculated the odds against persons of a given age dying during
the calendar year, and deduced the logical price of a policy. The first
life insurance companies established in London in the eighteenth century
made use of Halley’s tables, and turned mathematics into gold.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ASTRONOMY</li>
</ol>
<p>The stars were subjected to science in a hundred countries. In Italy
the Jesuit astronomer Riccioli (1650) discovered the first double star —
i.e., a star which to the eye seems one but is seen through the
telescope as two stars apparently revolving around each other. In Danzig
Johannes Heve- lius built an observatory in his own home, made his own
instruments, cata- logued 1,564 stars, discovered four comets, observed
the transit of Mercury,</p>
<ul>
<li>At Oxford, says Aubrey, “he kept a body . . . soused or pickled.”
One of the corpses turned over to him for dissection was that of Nan
Green, who had murdered her bastard child; Petty found her still
breathing, and brought her back to life . 19</li>

<p>noted the moon’s librations (periodic alternations in th e visibility
of its parts), charted its surface, and gave to several of its features
names that remain on lunar maps today. When he announced to Europe’s
stargazers that he could distinguish stellar positions as accurately
with a diopter (a sight using only one lens or prism) as with a compound
telescope, Robert Hooke challenged the claim; Halley traveled from
London to Danzig to test it, and reported that Hevelius had told the
truth. 21</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of astronomy for navigation, Louis XIV</p>
<p>provided funds to raise and equip an observatory at Paris (1667-72).
From that center Jean Picard led or sent expeditions to study the skies
from different points on the earth; he went to Uraniborg to note the
exact location from which Tycho Brahe had made his classic map of the
stars; and, by a variety of observations ranging from Paris to Amiens,
he measured a degree of longitude with such accuracy (within a few yards
of the current figure, 69.5 miles) that Newton is supposed to have used
Picard’s results to estimate the mass of the earth and verify the theory
of gravitation. By similar observations Picard reckoned the equatorial
diameter of the earth at 7,801 miles — not far from our present
computation of 7,913 miles. 22 These findings made it possible for a
ship at sea to determine its location with unprecedented precision. So
the commercial expansion and industrial development of Europe urged on
the scientific revolution, and profited from it.</p>
<p>At Picard’s suggestion Louis XIV invited to France the Italian
astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who had already acquired European
fame by discovering the spheroidal form of Jupiter and the periodic
rotation of Jupiter and Mars. Arrived in Paris (1669), he was received
by the King as a prince of science. 23 In 1672 he and Picard sent Jean
Richer to Cayenne, in South America, to observe Mars at its maximum
“opposition” to the sun and nearness to the earth; Cassini noted the
same opposition from Paris. The comparison of the simultaneous
observations from these two separate points gave new and more precise
values to the parallax of Mars and the sun and their distance from the
earth, and revealed vaster dimensions in the solar system than had been
estimated before. As a pendulum was found to beat more slowly at Cayenne
than a similar pendulum at Paris, the astronomers concluded that gravity
was less intense near the equator than in higher latitudes; and this
suggested that the earth was not a perfect sphere. Cassini thought it
was flattened at the equator; Newton thought it was flattened at the
poles; further research supported Newton. Meanwhile Cassini discovered
four new satellites of Saturn, and the division (now known by his name)
of Saturn’s ring into two. After Cassini’s death in 1712 he was
succeeded in the Paris observatory by his son Jacques, who measured</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan, and published the
first tables of the satellites of Saturn.</p>
<p>Christian Huygens, before joining the cosmopolitan assemblage of</p>
<p>scientists in Paris, made at The Hague some important contributions
to astronomy. With his brother Constantijn he developed a new method of
grinding and polishing lenses; with these he constructed telescopes of
greater power and clarity than any known before; thereby he discovered
(1655) the sixth satellite of Saturn, and that planet’s mysterious ring.
A year later he made the first delineation of the bright region (now
bearing his name) in the Orion nebula, and detected the multiple
character of its nuclear star.</p>
<p>The great rival to the Paris astronomers was the remarkable group
that gathered mostly around Halley and Newton in England. James Gregory
of Edinburgh lent distant aid by designing the first reflecting
telescope ( 1 663 ) — i.e., one in which the rays of light from the
object are concentrated by a curved mirror instead of a lens; Newton
improved this in 1668. In 1675 John Flamsteed and others addressed to
Charles II a memorial asking him to finance the building of a national
observatory, so that better methods of calculating longitude might guide
the English shipping that was now plowing the seas. The King provided
for the building, which was raised in the borough of Greenwich near
southeast London; this came to be used as the point of zero longitude
and standard time. Charles offered Flamsteed a small salary as director,
but nothing to pay for assistants or instruments. Flamsteed, frail and
sickly, gave his life to that observatory. He took pupils, bought
instruments out of his personal funds, received others as gifts from
friends, and set himself patiently to chart the sky as seen from
Greenwich. Before he died (1719) he had made the most extensive and
accurate star catalogue yet known, considerably improving on that which
Tycho Brahe had left to Kepler in 1601. Harassed by lack of aid, doing
himself the paperwork usually left to assistants, Flamsteed angered
Halley and Newton by delays in the calculation and announcement of his
results; at last Halley published them without Flamsteed’s permission,
and the ailing astronomer shook the stars with his wrath.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Edmund Halley was the finest gentleman of them all. An
enthusiastic schoolboy student of the sky, he published at twenty a
paper on the planetary orbits; and in that same year (1676) he set out
to see how the heavens looked from the southern hemisphere of the earth.
On the island of St. Helena he charted the behavior of 341 stars. On the
eve of his twenty-first birthday he made the first full observation of a
transit of Mercury. Back in England, he was elected a fellow of the
Royal Society at twenty- two. He recognized Newton’s genius, financed
the first edition of the costly Principia, and prefixed to it some
complimentary verse in</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>5°5</p>
<p>splendid Latin, ending in the line, Nec fas est proprius mortali
attingere divos (It is not allowed to any mortal to come closer to the
gods). 24 Halley edited the Greek text of the Conics of Apollonius of
Perga, and learned Arabic to translate Greek treatises preserved only in
that language.</p>
<p>He wrote his name in the sky by one of the most successful
predictions in history. Borelli had paved the way by discovering the
parabolic form of cometary paths (1665). When a comet appeared in 1682
Halley found similarities in its course with comets recorded in 1456,
1531, and 1607; he noted that these manifestations had come at intervals
of some seventy-five years, and he predicted a reappearance in 1758. He
could not live to see the fulfillment of his prophecy, but when the
comet returned it received his name, and added to the rising prestige of
science. Until late in the seventeenth century comets were considered to
be direct acts of God, portending great calamities to mankind; the
essays of Bayle and Fontenelle, and the prediction of Halley, laid this
superstition. Halley identified an- other comet, seen in 1680, with one
observed in the year of Christ’s death; he traced its recurrence every
575 years, and from this periodicity he computed its orbit and speed
around the sun. Commenting on these calculations, Newton concluded that
“the bodies of comets are solid, compact, fixed, and durable, like the
bodies of the planets,” and are not “vapors or exhalations of the earth,
of the sun, and other planets.” 25 *</p>
<p>In 1691 Halley was refused the Savilian chair of astronomy at Oxford
on suspicion of being a materialist. 28 In 1698, on a commission from
William III, he sailed far into the South Atlantic, studied the
variations of the compass, and charted stars as seen from the Antarctic.
(Compared with this expedition, said Voltaire, “the voyage of the
Argonauts was but the crossing of a bark from one side of a river to the
other.” 27 ) I n 1718 Halley pointed out that several of the supposedly
“fixed stars” had altered their positions since Greek times, and that
one of them, Sirius, had changed since Brahe; allowing for errors of
observation, he concluded that the stars vary their positions relative
to one another over great periods of time; and these “proper motions”
are now accepted as real. In 1721 he was appointed to succeed Flamsteed
as astronomer royal; but Flamsteed had died so poor that his creditors
seized his instruments, and Halley found his own work hampered by
inadequate equipment as well as by his own de- clining energies;
nevertheless he began, at sixty-four, to observe and record the
phenomena of the moon through its complete cycle of eighteen years. He
died in 1742, aged eighty-six, after wisely drinking a glass of wine
against his doctor’s orders. Life, like wine, should not be taken in
excess.</p>
<p>•Dryden, in Absalom and Achitophel (1681), had recently described
comets as “rising from earthy vapours ere they shine in the skies.”</p>

<li>THE EARTH</li>
</ol>
<p>In love with science, Halley had ventured into the mists of
meteorology with an essay (1697) on trade winds, and a chart that for
the first time mapped the movements of the air. He attributed these
movements to dif- ferences in the temperature and pressure of the
atmosphere; so the sun, moving apparently westward, carried heat with
it, especially along the equatorial regions of the earth; the air
rarefied by this heat sucked in less rarefied air from the east, and
created the prevailing equatorial winds that Columbus had relied on to
sail from east to west. Francis Bacon had sug- gested a similar
explanation. George Hadley was to develop it in 1735 by adding that the
greater eastward speed of the earth’s rotation at the equator creates a
contrary westward flow of air.</p>
<p>The development of the barometer and the thermometer made meteor-
ology a science. G uericke’s barometer rightly forecast a severe storm
in</p>
<ol start="1660" type="1">
<li>Various hygrometers were invented in the sixteenth century to
measure humidity. The Accademia del Cimento used a graduated vessel that
received the moisture dripping from the outside of an ice-filled
metallic cone. Hooke attached a grain bristle, or “beard” — which
swelled and bent with increasing moisture in the air — to an indicator
needle that turned as the bristle swelled. Hooke invented also a wind
gauge, a wheel barometer, and a weather clock. This last instrument,
designed on a commission from the Royal Society (1678), measured and
recorded the velocity and direc- tion of the wind, the pressure and
humidity of the atmosphere, the tempera- ture of the air, and the amount
of rainfall; for literal good measure it gave the time of day. Armed
with improved instruments, weather stations in diverse cities began to
record and compare their simultaneous observations, as between Paris and
Stockholm in 1649. Grand Duke Ferdinand II of Tuscany, patron of the
Cimento, sent barometers, thermometers, and hygrometers to chosen
observers at Paris, Warsaw, Innsbruck, and else- where, with
instructions for recording meteorological data daily, and transmitting a
copy to Florence for comparison. Leibniz persuaded the weather stations
at Hanover and Kiel to keep daily records from 1679 to</li>
</ol>
<p>The ingenious and inconclusive Hooke opened a hundred promising
avenues of investigation, but was too poor in funds or patience to
follow them to famous ends. We find him everywhere in the history of
British science in the second half of the seventeenth century. Son of a
minister who “died by suspending himself,” 28 he prefigured his
vacillating diversity by painting pictures, playing the organ, and
inventing thirty different ways of flying. At Oxford he took to
chemistry, serving as assistant to Robert</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>507</p>
<p>Boyle. In 1662 he was appointed “curator of experiments” for the
Royal Society; in 1665 he was professor of geometry in Gresham College;
in 1666, after the Great Fire of London, he took to architecture and
designed several major buildings — Montagu House, the College of
Physicians, and Bethlehem Hospital (“Bedlam”). After long poring th
rough microscopes, he published his chef- d’oeuvre, Micro graphia
(1665), containing a number of suggestive ideas in biology. He proposed
a wave theory of light, helped Newton in optics, and anticipated both
the law of inverse squares and the theory of gravitation. He discovered
the fifth star in Orion, and made the first attempts to determine by
telescope the parallax of a fixed star. He propounded a kinetic theory
of gases in 1678, and described a system of telegraphy in 1684. He was
among the first to apply the spring to regulate watches; he laid down
the principle of the sextant for measuring angular distances; he made a
dozen scientific instruments. He was probably the most original mind in
all that galaxy of geniuses that for a time made the Royal Society the
pacemaker of European science; but his somber and nervous nature kept
him from the acclaim that he deserved.</p>
<p>Even in geology he had his moment of truth. He argued that
fossils</p>
<p>proved for the earth and for life an antiquity quite incompatible
with the Book of Genesis; and he foresaw that the chronology of
terrestrial life would someday be calculated from the differing fossils
of successive strata. Most seventeenth-century writers still accepted
the Biblical account of Creation, and some of them struggled to
reconcile Genesis with the sporadic discoveries of geology. In An Essay
towards a Natural History of the</p>
<p>Earth (1695) John Woodward, after long study of his large collection
of fossils, restored Leonardo da Vinci’s interpretation of them as the
relics of plants or animals that had once lived on the earth, but even
he thought that the distribution of fossils was a result of Noah’s
Flood. An Anglican clergyman, Thomas Burnet, proposed (1680) a
reconciliation between Genesis and geology by stretching the “days” of
the Biblican Creation myth into epochs; this subterfuge proved
acceptable; but when Thomas, gather- ing courage, went on to explain the
story of Adam’s fall as an allegory, h e found himself barred from
ecclesiastical advancement.</p>
<p>Athanasius Kircher was both a good Jesuit and a great scientist; we
shall find him brilliant in a dozen fields. His Mundus subterraneus (
1665) charted ocean currents, suggested that underground streams were
fed from the sea, and ascribed volcanic eruptions and hot springs to
subterranean fires; this seemed to confirm the popular belief that hell
was in the center of the earth. Pierre Perrault (1674) rejected the idea
that springs and rivers have subterranean sources, and upheld the now
accepted view that they are the product of rain and snow. Martin Lister
explained volcanic eruptions as due to the heating and consequent
explosion of the sulphur in iron pyrites;</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>THE AGE OE LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>and experiment showed that a mixture of iron filings, sulphur, and
water, buried in the earth, became heated, cracked the earth above it,
and burst into flames.</p>
<p>The most prominent figure in the geology of this age was known to</p>
<p>Denmark as Niels Stensen, and to the international of science as
Nicolaus Steno. Born in Copenhagen, he studied medicine there and in
Leiden, where he numbered Spinoza among his friends. 29 Migrating to
Italy, he accepted Catholicism and became court physician to Ferdinand
II at Florence. In 1669 he published a small volume, De solido intra
solidwn naturaliter contento , which one student has ranked as “the most
important geological document of that century.” 30 Its purpose was to
confirm the new view of fossils; but as a prelude Steno for the first
time formulated principles to explain the evolution of the earth’s
crust. Studying the geology of Tuscany, he found six successive strata.
He analyzed their structure and contents, the formation of mountains and
valleys, the causes of volcanoes and earthquakes, and the fossil
evidence for formerly higher levels of rivers and the sea. The
reputation earned by this book, and by Steno’s anatomical studies, led
King Christian IV to offer him the chair of anatomy in the University of
Copenhagen. He accepted, but his zealous Catholicism caused some
friction; he returned to Florence, passed from science to religion, and
ended as bishop of Titopolis and vicar apostolic for north Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile geography was growing, usually as a by-product of mis-</p>
<p>sionary, military, or commercial enterprise. The Jesuits were almost
as devoted to science as to religion or politics; many of them belonged
to learned societies, which welcomed their geographical and
ethnographical reports. As missionaries they ventured into Canada,
Mexico, Brazil, Tibet, Mongolia, China . . . They gathered and remitted
much useful knowledge, and made the best maps of the areas they visited.
In 1651 Martino Martini published his Atlas sinensis, the fullest
geographical description of China yet printed; and in 1667 Athanasius
Kircher issued a magnificent China illustrata. Louis XTV sent six Jesuit
scientists, equipped with the latest instruments, to map China again; in
1718 they issued a vast map in 120 sheets, covering China, Manchuria,
Mongolia, and Tibet; this remained for two centuries the basis of all
later maps of those areas. The cartographical wonder of the age was the
map, twenty-four feet in diameter, which Giovanni Cassini and his aides
drew in ink on the floor of the Paris</p>
<p>observatory (c. 1690), showing the precise location, in latitude
and</p>
<p>longitude, of all important places on the earth. 31</p>
<p>Some famous travelers belong to this period. We have already helped
ourselves to Tavernier’s Six Voyages through Europe into Asia (1670),
and Chardin’s Travels in Persia (1686). “In my six voyages,” w rote</p>
<p>Tavernier, “and traveling by different roads, I had the leisure and
op -</p>
<p>CHAP. XVin) THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST 509</p>
<p>portunity to see all Turkey, all Persia, and all India. . . . The
last three times I went beyond Ganges to the island of Java, so that for
the space of forty years I have traveled above sixty thousand leagues by
land.” 32 Chardin in one sentence anticipated Montesquieu’s Spirit of
Laws : “The climate of each particular race is . . . always the primary
cause of the inclinations and cu stoms of its people.” 33 In 1670 -71
Frangois Bernier published an account of his travels and studies in
India, and was accused of having shed his Christianity en route. 34
William Dampier buccaneered in a hundred lands and seas, wrote A New
Voyage round, the World (1697), and gave a cue to Defoe by telling how,
on one of his later sallies, he piloted the vessel that rescued
Alexander Selkirk from an otherwise uninhabited island (1709).</p>
<p>Geography played its part in the erosion of Christian theology.
As</p>
<p>accounts of other continents accumulated, the educated classes of
Europe could not but marvel at the variety of religious beliefs on the
earth, the similarity of religious myths, the confidence of each cult in
the truth of its creed, and the moral level of Mohammedan or Buddhist
societies that in some respects shamed the gory wars and murderous
intolerance of peoples dowered with the Christian faith. Baron de
Lahontan, traveling in Canada in 1683, reported that he had much
difficulty in meeting criticisms of Christianity by Indian natives. 35
Bayle again and again quoted the customs and ideas of the Chinese or the
Japanese in criticizing European beliefs and ways. The relativity of
morals became an axiom of eighteenth-century philosophy; one wit
described the travels of Jacques Seden the hermaph- rodite, who, to his
delight, found a country where all the inhabitants were homosexuals, who
looked upon Europe’s heterosexuals as immoral and disgusting
monstrosities. 36</p>
<p>V. PHYSICS</p>
<p>Physics and chemistry conflicted less visibly than geography and
biology with the ancient creed, for they dealt with solids, liquids, and
gases that apparently had no connection with theology; but even in that
material realm the progress of science was enlarging the rule of law,
and weakening the faith in miracles. The study of physics rested on no
philosophical interests, but on commercial and industrial needs.</p>
<p>Navigators, having induced astronomers to chart the skies more ac-
curately, now offered rewards for a clock that would aid in finding</p>
<p>longitude despite the perturbations of the sea. Longitude at sea
could be determined by comparing the moment of sunrise or meridian with
the time shown at that instant by a clock set to keep Greenwich or Paris
time; but unless the clock was accurate the calculation would be
dangerously wrong.</p>
<p>5 io</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>In 1657 Huygens contrived a reliable clock by attaching a pendulum to
a toothed escapement wheel, but such a clock was useless on a rolling
and pitching ship.* After many trials, Huygens constructed a successful
marine clock by substituting for the pendulum a balance wheel worked by
two springs. This was among the illuminating suggestions expounded by
him in one of the classics of modern science, the Horologium
oscillatorium (The Pendulum Clock ) published in Paris in 1673. Three
years later Hooke invented the anchor escapement of clocks, applied
spiral springs to the balance wheel of watches, and expounded the action
of the springs on the principle Ut tensio sic vis — “As the tension, so
the force”; this is still called Hooke’s law. Pocket watches could now
be made more competently and cheaply than before.</p>
<p>In the Horologium and a special monograph Huygens studied the law of
centrifugal force — that every particle of a rotating body not lying in
the axis of rotation is subject to a centrifugal force which increases
with its distance from the axis, and with the speed of rotation. He set
a clay sphere rotating rapidly, and found that it assumed the form of a
spheroid flattened at both ends of the axis. On this centrifugal
principle he explained the polar flattening of the planet Jupiter, and
by analogy he concluded that the earth too must be slightly flattened at
the poles.</p>
<p>Huygens’ Tractatus de Morn Corporum ex Percussione (1703), pub -</p>
<p>lished eight years after his death, continued the studies of Galileo,
Descartes, and Wallis on the problems of impact. These presented
intriguing mysteries, from the play of billiards to the collision of
stars. How is force transmitted from a moving object to an object that
it strikes? Huygens did not solve the mystery, but he stated some basic
principles:</p>
<p>I. If upon a body at rest another body equal to it impinges, the</p>
<p>latter will come to rest after the impact, while the body initially
at rest will acquire the velocity of the impinging body.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>If two equal bodies collide with unequal velocities, they will</li>
</ol>
<p>move, after impact, with interchanged velocities. . . .</p>
<ol start="11" type="I">
<li>In the mutual impact of two bodies the sum of the products of</li>
</ol>
<p>the masses into the squares of the relative velocities is the same
before and after impact.</p>
<p>These propositions, formulated by Huygens in 1669, gave partial
expression to the most comprehensive principle of modern physics, the
conservation of energy. They were, however, only ideally true, since
they assumed</p>
<ul>
<li>Leonardo da Vinci, about 1500, made drawings of a pendulum and an
escapement mechanism. Galileo formulated some laws of the pendulum, and
conceived the idea of a pendulum clock in 1641, but he died before
applying the idea in practice. Camerini in 1656 made a small pendulum
clock just a few months before Huygens.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>5 ”</p>
<p>complete elasticity in bodies. As no body in nature is perfectly
elastic, the relative velocity of impinging objects is diminished
according to the</p>
<p>substance of which they are composed. Newton determined this rate of
diminution for wood, cork, steel, and glass in the introductory scholium
to Book I of his Principia ( 1687) .</p>
<p>Another line of investigation flowed from the experiments of
Torricelli and Pascal on atmospheric pressure. Pascal had announced in
1647 that “any vessel, however large, can be made empty of all matter
known in nature and perceptible to the senses.” 37 For hundreds of years
European philosophy had proclaimed that natura abhonat vacuum; even now
a Paris professor informed Pascal that the angels themselves could not
produce a vacuum, and Descartes scornfully remarked that the only
existing vacuum was in Pascal’s head. But about 1650 Otto von Guericke
con- structed at Magdeburg an air pump which produced so nearly complete
a vacuum that he astonished the dignitaries of his country, and the
luminaries of the scientific world, with a famous experiment known as
“the Magdeburg hemisphe res” (1654) . In the presence of the Emperor
Ferdinand III and the Imperial Diet at Ratisbon, he brought two bronze
hemispherical shells to- gether in such a way that they were
hermetically sealed but not mechani- cally connected at their edges; he
pumped nearly all the air from their united interiors; then he showed
that the combined strength of sixteen horses — eight pulling in one
direction, eight in the opposite direction — could not separate the two
halves of the sphere; but when a stopcock in one hemisphere was opened,
admitting air, the shells could be separated by hand.</p>
<p>Guericke had a flair for making physics intelligible to emperors.
By</p>
<p>emptying a copper sphere of water and air he caused it to collapse
with a loud and startling noise; so he demonstrated the pressure of the
atmosphere. He balanced two equal globes, and made one fall by pumping
air from the other; so he proved that air has weight. He confessed that
all vacuums were incomplete, but he showed that in his imperfect vacuums
a flame would be extinguished, animals would suffocate, and a striking
clock would make no sound; so he prepared for the discovery of oxygen,
and revealed air as the medium of sound. He used the suction of a vacuum
to pump water and raise weights, and shared in preparing for the steam
engine. Having become burgomaster of Magdeburg, he delayed publishing
his discoveries till 1672; but he communicated them to Kaspar Schott,
Jesuit professor of physics at Wurzburg, who printed an account of them
in 1657. It was this publication that stimulated Boyle to the researches
leading to the law of atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Robert Boyle was a prime factor in the flowering of English science
in the second half of the seventeenth century. His father, Richard
Boyle, Earl</p>
<p>5 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>of Cork, had acquired a large estate in Ireland, and Robert inherited
most of this at the age of seventeen (1644). On frequent visits to
London he became acquainted with Wallis, Hooke, Wren, and other members
of the “Invisible College.” Fascinated by their work and their
aspirations, he moved to Oxford and built a laboratory there (1654). He
was a man of warm enthusiasms and of a piety that no science could
destroy. He refused to communicate further (through Oldenburg) with
Spinoza when he learned that the philosopher worshiped “substance” as
God; but he placed much of his fortune at the service of science, and
helped many friends. Tall and lean, frail and often ill, he held death
at a distance by resolute diet and regimen. He found in his laboratory
“that water of Lethe which causes me to forget everything but the joy of
making experiments.” 38</p>
<p>Having read of Guericke’s air pump, Boyle devised, with Hooke’s help
(1657), a “pneumatic engine” to study the properties of the atmosphere.
With this and later pumps he proved that the column of mercury in a
barometer is supported by atmospheric pressure, and he measured roughly
the densit y of the air. He advanced upon Galileo’s alleged experiment
at Pisa by showing that even in an incomplete vacuum a bunch of feathers
fell as rapidly as a stone. He showed that light is not affected by a
vacuum, and therefore does not, like sound, use air as its medium of
transmission; and he confirmed Guericke’s demonstration that air is
indispensable to life. (When a mouse fainted in the vacuum chamber he
stopped the experiment and revived it by letting in air.) We see the
international of science in action when we learn that Guericke was
stimulated by Boyle’s work to contrive a better air pump and resume his
scientific studies; and that Huygens, visiting Boyle in 1661, was led to
make similar instruments and tests.</p>
<p>Boyle went on to creative inquiries into refraction, crystals,
specific</p>
<p>gravities, hydrostatics, and heat. He crowned his contributions to
physics by formulating the law that bears his name: that the pressure of
air or any gas varies inversely as its volume — or that at a constant
temperature the pressure of a gas, multiplied by its volume, is
constant. He first announced this principle in 1662, and generously
credited it to his pupil Richard Towneley. Hooke had reached the same
formula in 1660 by independent experiments, but did not make it known
till 1665. A French priest, Edme Mariotte, about the same time as Boyle,
arrived at a similar conclusion — “air is compressed according to the
weight acting upon it”; he published this in 1676; and on the Continent
his name, rather than Boyle’s, is attached to the law of atmospheric
pressure. Whatever its parentage, it was one of the progenitors of the
steam engine and the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Boyle and Hooke followed up Bacon ’s view that “heat is a motion of
expansion not uniformly of the whole body, but in the smaller parts of
it.” 39 Describing heat as “a property arising in a body from the motion
or</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST J 1 3</p>
<p>agitation of its parts,” Ho oke distinguished it from fire and flame,
which he attributed to the action of air on heated bodies. “All bodies,”
said Hooke, “have some degree of heat in them,” for “the parts of all
bodies, though never so solid, do yet vibrate”; 40 cold is merely a
negative conception. Mariotte amused his friends by showing that “cold”
could bum: with a concave slab of ice he focused sunlight upon
gunpowder, causing it to explode. Spinoza’s friend Count Ehrenfried
Walter von Tschimhaus melted porcelain and silver dollars by focusing
upon them the light of the sun.</p>
<p>In the physics of sound two Englishmen, William Noble and Thomas
Pigot, separately showed (c. 1673) that not only the whole, but
different parts of a string may vibrate with diverse overtones, in
sympathy with a near and related string plucked, struck, or bowed.
Descartes had suggested this to Mersenne, and Joseph Sauveur, working on
this idea, arrived in- dependently at results similar to those of the
Englishmen ( 1 700) ; we should note in passing that Sauveur, who first
used the word acoustics, had been a deaf mute from infancy. 41 In 1711
John Shore invented the tuning fork. Attempts to find the velocity of
sound were made in this period by Borelli, Viviani, Picard, Cassini,
Huygens, Flamsteed, Boyle, Halley, and Newton; Boyle, reckoning it at
1,126 feet per second, came closest to our current estimate. William
Derham pointed out (1708) that this knowledge could be used to calculate
the distance of a storm by observing the time interval between the
lightning flash and the thunderclap.</p>
<p>The second half of the seventeenth century was probably the most</p>
<p>brilliant epoch in the history of the physics of light. First, what
was light itself? Hooke, always ready to delve into difficulties,
hazarded the view that light is “nothing else but a peculiar motion of
the parts of the luminous body” 42 — i.e., light differs from heat only
in the more rapid motion of the</p>
<p>• Cf. our current conception of light as visible radiant energy. All
bodies are assumed to be continually emitting radiant energy. Radiation
from objects warmer than the human body are felt by the skin as heat;
but if the temperature of the object is sufficiently in - creased it
will become luminous — i.e., some of its emitted radiation will be felt
by the eye as light.</p>

<p>on that slender basis he calculated the speed of light at some
120,000 miles per second. (The current estimate is 186,000 miles.)</p>
<p>But how was light transmitted? Did it move in straight lines? If so,
how did it get around comers? Francesco Grimaldi, Jesuit professor at
Bologna, discovered and named (1665) the phenomena of diffraction — that
rays of light passing through a small opening into a dark room spread
more widely on the opposite wall than straight lines from source to wall
would warrant, and that rays of light are slightly deflected from a
straight line when they pass by the edges of an opaque body; these and
other findings led Grimaldi to accept Leonardo da Vinci’s s uggestion
that light moves in expanding waves. Hooke agreed, but it was Huygens
who established the wave theory still popular among physicists. In
another classic of modern science, Traite de la lurmere (1690), Huygens
reported the conclusions he had reached from studies begun twelve years
before: that light is transmitted by a hypothetical substance which he
called aether (from the Greek word for the sky), and which he conceived
as made up of small, hard, elastic bodies transmitting light in
successive spherical waves spreading out from the luminous source. On
this theory he formulated laws of reflection, refraction, and double
refraction; he ascribed to the enveloping motion of the waves the
ability of light to move around corners and opaque objects; and he
explained translucence by supposing the ether particles to be so minute
that they can travel around and between the particles composing
transparent liquids and solids. But he confessed himself unable to
explain polarization; this was one of the reasons why Newton rejected
the wave hypothesis and preferred the corpuscular theory of light.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century made only modest advances in the study of
electricity after the work of Gilbert and Kircher on magnetism, and of
Cabeo on electrical repulsion. Halley studied the influence of
terrestrial magnetism on compass needles, and was the first to recognize
a connection between the magnetism of the earth and the aurora borealis
(1692). Guericke reported in 1672 some experiments in frictional
electricity. A ball of sulphur, after being rotated against his hand,
attracted paper, feathers, and other light objects, and carried them
around with it in its rotation; he likened this to the action of the
earth carrying along with it the objects on or near its surface. He
verified electrical repulsion by showing that a feather, placed between
the electrified ball and the floor, jumped up and down from one to the
other. He pioneered in studying conduction by proving that an electric
charge could travel along a linen thread, and that bodies could become
electrified by being brought near to the electrified ball. Francis
Hauksbee, of the Royal Society, developed (1705-9) a better method of
generating electricity by rapidly rotating an exhausted glass ball, and
then applying it to his hand; the contacts gave off sparks an inch
long,</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>

<p>providing light enough for reading. Another Englishman, Wall, having
produced similar sparks, likened their sound and light to thunder and
lightning (1708). Newton made the same comparison in 1716; Franklin
confirmed the relation in 1749. So, year by year, and mind by mind, the
impenetrable immensity surrenders some teasing, luring fragment of its
mystery.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CHEMISTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>This remarkable century saw the science of chemistry evolve from the
experiments and vagaries of alchemy. Industry had long been accumulating
chemical knowledge through such operations as smelting iron, tanning
leather, mixing dyes, brewing beer; but the investigation of substances
in their composition, combination, and transformation had been for the
most part left to alchemists seeking gold, or to pharmacologists
concocting drugs, or to philosophers, from Democritus to Descartes,
puzzling over the con- stitution of matter. Some approach to chemistry
had been made by Andreas Libavius in 1597 and by Jan van Helmont in
1640; but both of these men shared the alchemist’s hope of transmuting
“base” metal into gold. Boyle himself made experiments with this aim. In
1689 he secured repeal of an old English statute against “multiplying
gold and silver,” 43 and at his death (1691) he left to his executors a
quantity of red earth with instruc- tions for trying to turn it into
gold. 44 Now that the transmutation of metals is a cliche of chemistry
we can applaud the science in alchemy while condemning and concealing
the itch for gold.</p>
<p>The greatest blow to alchemy was the publication of Boyle’s Sceptical
Chymist (1661) — the prime classic in the history of chemistry. He</p>
<p>apologized for “suffering” his treatise “to pass abroad so maimed and
imperfect,” 45 but, with his many ailments, he was never confident of
much longer life. He was consoled to “observe that of late chymistry
begins, as indeed it deserves, to be cultivated by learned men who
before despised it.” 46 He called his chemistry skeptical because he
proposed to reject all mystical explanations and occult qualities as the
“sanctuary of ignorance,” and was resolved to rely upon “experiments
rather than syllogisms.” 47 He abandoned the traditional division of
matter into the four elements of air, fire, water, and earth; these, he
argued, were compounds, not elements; the real ele- ments were rather
“certain primitive and simple, or perfectly unmingled bodies, which, not
being made of any other bodies or of one another,” are the ingredients
of all compounds, and into which all compounds may be resolved. He did
not mean that the elements were the ultimate constituents of matter;
these minima naturalia, he thought, were tiny particles, invisible</p>
<p>516</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>to the eye, and differing in shape and size, like the atoms of
Leucippus. From the diversity and motion of these particles, and their
union in</p>
<p>“corpuscles,” all bodies, and all their qualities and conditions,
like color, magnetism, heat, and fire, arise by purely mechanical means
and laws.</p>
<p>Fire was as fascinating to scientists as to dreamers at the hearth.
What made a substance bum? How explain those ever-changing tongues of
flame, beautiful, imperious, and terrible? In 1669 a German chemist,
Johann Joachim Becher, reduced all “elements” to two — water and earth;
one form of the latter he called “oily earth,” which he believed present
in all com - bustible bodies; this it was that burned. In the eighteenth
century Georg Stahl, following this false lead, was to set chemistry
askew for decades with his similar theory of “phlogiston.” Boyle took
another cue. Noting that various burning substances ceased to bum in a
vacuum, he concluded that “there is in the air a little vital
quintessence . . . whic h serves to the</p>
<p>refreshment and restoration of our vital spirits.” 48 His younger con
- temporary John Mayow, also of the Royal Society, advanced (1647) to-
ward our current theory of fire by positing among the constituents of
air a substance that unites with metals when they are calcined
(oxidized) ; and he believed that a similar substance, entering our
bodies, changes venous into arterial blood. A hundred years had to pass
before Scheele and Priestley would definitely discover oxygen.</p>
<p>About 1670 a German alchemist, Hennig Brand, discovered that he could
obtain from human urine a chemical that glowed in the dark without
preliminary exposure to light. A Dresden chemist, Kraft, exhibited the
new product before Charles II at London in 1677. Boyle drew from the
secretive Kraft only the admission that the luminous substance “was some
- what that belonged to the body of man.” 49 The hint proved enough:
Boyle soon obtained his own supply of phosphorus, and by a series of
experiments he established all that is yet known about the glowing of
that element. The new product cost its purchasers six guineas (15?) per
ounce, despite the abundance of the source.</p>

<li>TECHNOLOGY</li>
</ol>
<p>Until the nineteenth century more stimulus was given by industry to
science than by science to industry; and until the twentieth century
inventions were made less often in the laboratory than in the shop or
field. In the most important case of all, the development of the steam
engine, the two processes may have proceeded hand in hand.</p>
<p>Hero of Alexandria, in or before the third century A.D., made several
steam engines, but, so far as we know, these were used as toys or
marvels to</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>517</p>
<p>amuse the multitude rather than as mechanisms replacing human energy.
Early in the sixteenth century Leonardo da Vinci described a gun which
by steam pressure could propel an iron bolt twelve hundred yards; but
his scientific manuscripts remained unpubl ished till 1880. Some of
Hero’s Greek writings were translated into Latin in 1575, and into
Italian in 1589. Jerome Cardan (1550) and Giambattista della Porta
(1601) pointed out that a vacuum could be produced by the condensation
of steam, and Porta described a machine for using the pressure of steam
to raise a column of water. Similar applications of expanding steam were
proposed by Salomon de Caus at Paris in 1615 and by Branca at Rome in
1629; and in 1630 David Ramsay obtained from Charles I of England a
patent for machines “to raise water from low pits by fire … to make any
sort of mills to go on standing waters by continual motion, without help
of wind, waite</p>
<ul>
<li>weight?〕, or horse.” 50 In 1663 Edward Somerset, Marquis of
Worcester,</li>
</ul>
<p>Huygens’ French assistant, Denis Papin, went to England, worked with
Boyle, and published in 1681 an account of a “digester” — a pressure
cooker — to soften bones by water boiling in a closed vessel. To prevent
explosion he attached to the top of the vessel a tube that could be
opened when the pressure reached a certain point; this first “safety
valve” played a saving role in the development of the steam engine.
Papin went on to show that the power of expanding steam could be piped
pneumatically from one place to another. Moving to Marburg in Germany,
he demonstrated (1690) the first engine in which the condensation of
steam, producing a vacuum, was used to drive a piston. He suggested the
possibilities of this machine for throwing bombs, raising water from
mines, and propelling ships by paddle wheels; and in 1707 (precisely a
century before Fulton’s Clermont moved up the Hudson River) he used his
steam engine to drive a paddle- wheel boat on the River Fulda at Cassel.
52 This boat, however, was wrecked, and the German authorities,
comfortable in the status quo , and perhaps fearing the spread of
unemployment, discouraged the development of mechanical power. 53</p>
<p>A similar apparatus had been offered to the Navy Board in England</p>
<p>about 1700 by Thomas Savery, but had been turned down with the
alleged</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>comment, “What have interloping people, that have no concern with us,
to do to pretend to contrive or invent things for us?” 64 Savery
demonstrated his device on the Thames, but the Navy again rejected it.
In 1698 Savery patented the first steam engine actually employed to pump
water out of mines. In 1699 he was awarded a patent granting him for
fourteen years “the sole exercise of a new invention . . . for raising
water and occasioning motion by the impellant force of fire; which will
be of great use for</p>
<p>draining mines, serving towns with water, and for the working of all
sorts of mills.” 55 Savery’s engines, however, proved costly and
dangerous: they had gauge cocks but no safety valves; they were subject
to boiler explosions; and though they were used in some mines to pump
out water, the mine owners soon returned to the employment of
horses.</p>
<p>At this point in the story we again meet Robert Hooke. About 1702,
according to a reliable contemporary, he corresponded with a Dartmouth
ironmonger and blacksmith, Thomas Newcomen, on the possibility of using
the air- pump principle to produce mechanical power. “Could you make a
speedy vacuum under your second cylinder,” he wrote, “your work is
done.” 56 Apparently Newcomen had been experimenting with a steam
engine; here science and industry visibly touched. Hooke was skeptical,
let the matter drop, and again missed an opportunity. Newcomen joined
with a plumber, John Cawley, to build (1712) a steam engine — with rock-
ing beam, piston, and safety valve — that could be trusted to do heavy
work without danger of explosion, and with fully automatic control.
Newcomen continued till his death (1729) to improve his engine; but we
may date from Savery’s patent in 1699, and Newcomen’s engine of 1712,
the begin - nings of the Industrial Revolution that in the next two
centuries would change the face and air of the world.</p>
<p>vra. BIOLOGY</p>
<p>The remarkable group of investigators that made the glory of the
Royal Society extended its researches into the sciences of life. The
omnipresent Hooke demonstrated experimentally what Sir Kenelm Digby —
that “arrant mountebank,” as Evelyn called him 61 — had already pointed
out: that plants need air for their life. He sowed lettuce seed in soil
under the open sky, and, at the same time, similar seed in similar soil
in a vacuum chamber; the first grew an inch and a half in eight days,
the other not at all. Hooke identified the part of the air used up in
combustion with the part used up in plant and animal respiration, and
described this used part as nitrous in character (1665). He showed that
animals which had stopped breathing could be kept alive by blowing air
into their lungs with bellows. He</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>5 1 9</p>
<p>discovered the cellular structure of living tissue, and invented the
term cell for its organic constituents. Through his microscope the
members of the Society saw with delight the cells of cork, whereof,
Hooke estimated, one cubic inch contained 1,200,000,000 cells. He
studied the histology of insects and plants, and gave novel drawings of
them in his Micrographia. Hooke was always on the verge of ranking with
Galileo and Newton.</p>
<p>Another member of the society, John Ray, shared in giving its modem
form to the science of botany. He was the son of a blacksmith, but he
made his way to Cambridge, became a fellow of Trinity College, and
was</p>
<p>ordained an Anglican priest. Like Boyle, he gave his devotion to
religion as well as to science. Because he would not sign the Act of
Uniformity (1662) pledging nonresistance to Charles II, he resigned his
fellowship, and set out with his pupil Francis Willughby on a tour of
Europe to gather data for a systematic description of the animal and
plant kingdoms. Willughby undertook the zoology, but died after
completing the sections on birds and fishes. In 1670 Ray issued a
Catalogus Plantarum Angliae, which became the frame of English botany.
Helped by the improved terminology and classification established in
1678 by Joachim Jungius, Ray proposed a Methodus Plantarum Nova (1682),
which divided all flowering plants into dicotyledons and monocotyledons
according to their having two seed leaves or only one. He completed his
great task in one of the chefs- d’oeuvre of modern science, the massive
three -volume Historia Generalis Plantarum (1682-1704), which described
18,625 species of plants. Ray was the first to use the word species in
its biological sense, as a group of organisms derived from similar
parents and capable of reproducing their kind. This definition, and the
later classification by Linnaeus (1751), set the stage for the
controversy over the origin and mutability of species. Meanwhile Ray
edited Willughby’s manuscripts on ichthyology and</p>
<p>ornithology, and added a Synopsis Methodic a Animalium Quadrupedum
(1693), providing for modern zoology the first really scientific
classification of animals. 58 Order was Ray’s first law.</p>
<p>Even in antiquity botanists had recognized that some plants might be
termed female because they bore fruit, and others male because they did
not, and Theophrastus, in the third century before Christ, had observed
that the female date palm produces fruit only if the dust of the male
date palm has been shaken over it; but these ideas had been almost
forgotten. In 1682 Nehemiah Grew, of the Royal Society, gave a new charm
to flowers by definitely affirming the sexuality of plants. Studying
plant tissues under the microscope, he noted the pores in the upper
surface of leaves, and suggested that leaves are organs of respiration.
Flowers he described as organs of reproduction: the pistils as female,
the stamens as male, the pollen as seed. He mistakenly assumed that all
plants are hermaphrodites, uniting</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>male and female structures in one organism. In 1691 Rudolf
Camerarius, professor of botany at Tubingen, definitely proved the
sexuality of plants by showing that they would bear no fruit after the
removal of their</p>
<p>anthers — the pollen-containing part of the stamens.</p>
<p>On the same day (December 7, 1671) that the Royal Society of London
received Grew’s first essay (The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun) it re -
ceived also a manuscript from Marcello Malpighi of Bologna. The Society
published it (1675) as Anatomes Plantarum Idea; the use of Latin was
still facilitating the international of science. Malpighi divided with
Grew the honor of establishing the histology of plants, but his major
contribution was to zoology. In 1 676 Mariotte, by chemically analyzing
the residue of plants and the soil in which they had grown, showed that
they absorb nutritive elements in the water that they suck from the
earth. Neither Mariotte nor Grew nor Malpighi recognized the power of
plants to take nourishment from the air; but the processes of nutrition
and reproduction now discovered were a v ast advance upon Aristotle’s
vague explanation of plant growth by the expansive ambitions of the
“vegetable soul.”</p>
<p>An old and popular notion received in 1668 the first of several
shocks when Francesco Redi of Arezzo published his Esperienze intorno
alia generazione degli insetti — experiments tending to disprove
abiogenesis, or the spontaneous generation of living organisms from
nonliving matter. Until the second half of the seventeenth century it
was almost universally believed (William Harvey an outstanding
exception) that minute animals and plants could be generated in dirt or
slime, and especially in decaying flesh; so Shakespeare spoke of “the
sun breeding maggots in dead dogs.” 69 Redi showed that maggots did not
form on meat that was protected from insects, but did form on meat
exposed. He formulated his conclusion in the phrase Omne vivum ex ovo —
“Every living thing comes from an egg or a seed.” When protozoa were
discovered, the argument for abiogenesis was revived; Spallanzani
answered it in 1767, and Pasteur again in 1861.</p>
<p>The discovery of those single-celled organisms which were later
termed protozoa was the major contribution of this age to zoology. Anton
van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutchman of Delft, but he reported through the
Royal Society at London his scientific results through forty of his
ninety- one years. Coming of a family of rich brewers, he was able to
accept employments that offered him more leisure than pay, and he gave
himself with fascinated pertinacity to studying the new world of life
revealed by the microscope. He had 247 of these instruments, most of
them made by himself, and his laboratory sparkled with 419 lenses, some
of which may have been ground by Spinoza, who had been born in the same
year (1632) and the same land as he. Peter the Great, when in Delft in
1698, made it a</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>point to peer through Leeuwenhoek’s microscopes. When (1675) the
scientist turned one of these to the study of some rain water that had
fallen into a pot a few days before, he was astonished to see “little
animals appear - ing to me ten thousand times less than those
represented by Mons. Swammerdam and by him called water fleas or water
lice, which may be perceived in the water with the naked eye”; 80 and he
proceeded to describe an organism that we now recognize as the bell
animalcule ( V orticella ) . This was apparently the earliest
description of a protozoon. In 1683 Leeuwenhoek discovered still tinier
organisms — bacteria. He found them first on his own teeth, “though my
teeth,” he protested, “are kept usually very clean”; and he startled
some neighbors by examining their spittle and showing them, under the
microscope, “a great many living creatures” therein. 61 In 1677 he
discovered spermatozoa in semen. He marveled at nature’s profuse
equipment for reproduction: in a small quantity of human semen he
estimated a thousand spermatozoa; and he calculated that in the milt of
a single codfish there were 150 billion sperm — more than ten times the
number of inhabitants that the earth would contain if all the land were
as thickly populated as the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Jan Swammerdam was five years younger than Leeuwenhoek, but</p>
<p>preceded him by forty-three years to the grave; he was a man of
nerves, passions, ailments, and fluctuating purposes, who stopped his
scientific work at thirty-six and burned himself out at forty-three
(1680) . He was intended for the ministry, but abandoned theology for
medicine. Having secured his medical degree, he devoted himself to
anatomy. He became enamored of bees, and especially of their intestines;
he spent his days in dissecting them, his nights in reporting and
illustrating his findings. When he had finished his classic treatise on
bees (1673) he broke down physically; soon thereafter he gave up science
as too worldly a pursuit, and returned to religion. Fifty- seven years
after his death his manuscripts were collected and published as Biblia
Naturae , the Bible of nature. This contained, in remarkably exact
detail, the life history of a dozen typical insects, including the May
fly and the honey bee, and microscopic studies of the squid, the snail,
the clam, and the frog. Here, too, were descriptions of the experiments
by which</p>
<p>Swammerdam proved that muscles in tissues cut off from an animal’s
body could be made to contract by stimulation of the connecting nerve.
Like Redi he rejected abiogenesis; he went further, and showed that
instead of decay- ing flesh producing minute organisms, it is these that
produce decay in organic matter. In his brief career Swammerdam founded
modern ento- mology, and established himself as one of the most accurate
observers in the history of science. His return from science to religion
personified the hesitation of modem man between a search for truth that
smiles at hope and a retreat to hopes that shy from truth.</p>

<li>ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</li>
</ol>
<p>The human body, subjected to the microscope, gave up some of its</p>
<p>intimate secrets to the advancing army of science. In 1651 Jean
Pecquet of Paris traced the course of the lacteal vessels; in 1653 Olof
Rudbeck of Uppsala discovered, and Thomas Bartholin of Copenhagen
described, the lymphatic system; and in 1664 Swammerdam detected the
lymphatic valves. In that year his friend Regnier de Graaf demonstrated
the function and operation of the pancreas and the bile. In 1661
Nicolaus Steno, another friend, discovered the duct (still bearing his
name) of the parotid gland, and a year later the lachrymal ducts of the
eye. Graaf studied especially the anatomy of testicles and ovaries; in
1672 he gave the first account of those ovum-bearing sacs which Haller
in his honor called the Graafian follicles. Bartholin left his card on
two oval bodies adjoining the vagina, and William Cowper (physician, not
poet) found (1702), and gave his name to, the glands that discharge into
the urethra. Franciscus Sylvius (beloved teacher of Graaf, Swammerdam,
Steno, and Willis at Leiden) left his signature on a fissure of the
brain (1663). Thomas Willis, a founder of the Royal Society, published
in 1664 a Cerebri Anatome which was the most complete account yet given
of the nervous system; his name is still borne by the “circle of
Willis,” a hexagonal network of arteries at the base of the brain.</p>
<p>The outstanding anatomist of the age was Marcello Malpighi. Bom near
Bologna in 1628, he took his degree in medicine there; after some pro-
fessorial years in Pisa and Messina he returned to Bologna, and taught
medicine in the university for twenty-five years. After working on the
microscopic anatomy of plants he turned his lenses upon the silkworm,
and recorded his findings in a classic monograph. In this investigation
he nearly lost his eyesight; nevertheless, “in performing these
researches,” he wrote, “so many marvels of nature were spread before my
eyes that I ex - perienced an internal pleasure that my pen could not
describe.” 62 He must have felt like Keats first looking into Chapman’s
Homer when (1661) he saw, in the lungs of the frog, how the blood passed
from the arteries into the veins through vessels so f ine that he called
them “capillaries”; he found a network of such “little hairs” wherever
arterial became venous blood; now, for the first time, the circulatory
system was demonstrated in its course.</p>
<p>This was but a part, though the most important, of Malpighi’s con
-</p>
<p>tributions to anatomy. He was the first to prove that the papillae of
the tongue are organs of taste; the first to distinguish the red
corpuscles in the blood (but he mistook them to be globules of fat); the
first to give an</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>523</p>
<p>accurate account of the nervous and circulatory systems in the
embryo; the first to describe the histology of the cortex and the spinal
cord; the first to make possible a practical theory of respiration by
describing with precision the vesicular structure of the lungs. Justly
his name is scattered over our flesh in the “Malpighian tufts,” or loops
of capillaries, in the kid - neys, in the “Malpighian corpuscles” of the
spleen, in the “Malpighian layer” of the skin. Many of his revelations
and interpretations were chal - lenged by his contemporaries; he
defended himself vigorously, and won his battles at some cost to his
nerves. As if laying these matters before the supreme court of science
in his age, he sent to the Royal Society at London an account of his
labors, discoveries, and controversies; the Society pub- lished this as
his autobiography. In 1691 he was appointed personal phy- sician to Pope
Innocent XII, but he died in 1694 of an apoplectic stroke. His detection
of the capillaries is one of the landmarks in the history of anatomy;
his work as a whole established the science of histology.</p>
<p>As anatomical research progressed it revealed so many similarities
be- tween human and animal organs that some students were led close to a
theory of evolution. Edward Tyson (whose name is given to the sebaceous
glands of the foreskin) published in 1699 Orang-Outang, sive Homo</p>
<p>Sylvestris, descri bing the orangutan as a “man of the woods”; he
compared the anatomy of man with that of the monkey, and reckoned the
chimpanzee to be intermediate between the two. Only the fear of a
theological earth- quake kept biology from anticipating Darwin in the
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>From anatomy and structure the researchers passed to physiology and
function. Till about 1660 respiration had been interpreted as a cooling
process; now the experimenters likened it to combustion. Hooke proved
that the essence of respiration is the exposure of venous blood to fresh
air in the lungs. Richard Lower, also of the Royal Society, showed
(1669) that venous blood could be changed to arterial by aeration, and
that arterial blood became venous when persistently kept from contact
with air. He suggested that the chief agent in aeration is a “nitrous
spirit” in the atmos - phere. Following these leads, Lower’s friend John
Mayow described this active factor as “nitro -aerial particles.” In
respiration, he believed, the nitrous particles are absorbed from the
air into the blood; hence air exhaled is lighter in weight and less in
volume than the same air inhaled. Animal heat is due to the union of
nitrous particles with combustible elements in the blood; increased heat
after exercise results from the extra intake of nitrous particles
through increased respiration. These nitrous particles, said Mayow, play
the leading role in the life of animals and plants.</p>
<p>The interpretation of vital processes led to one of the most
indestructible controversies in the history of modem science. As
physiology delved more and more curiously into the human anatomy, one
after another function</p>
<p>5 2 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>of the body seemed to yield to a mechanical interpretation in terms
of physics and chemistry. Respiration appeared to be a combination of
ex- pansion, aeration, and contraction; the functions of the saliva, the
bile, and the pancreatic juice were obviously chemical; and Gian Alfonso
Borelli apparently brought to completion (1679) the mechanical analysis
of muscular action. Steno, the fervent Catholic, adopted the mechanical
view of physiological processes, and dismissed as “mere words meaning
nothing” such vague phrases as Galen’s “animal spirits.” Descartes’
conception of the body as a machine seemed now fully justified.</p>
<p>Nevertheless most scientists felt that these bodily mechanisms were
merely the instruments of some vital principle beyond analysis in
physico- chemical terms. Francis Glisson, a founder of the Royal
Society, ascribed to all living substance a characteristic
“irritability” — susceptibility to stim- ulation — which he thought to
be absent from nonliving matter. Just as Newton, after reducing the
cosmos to mechanism, ascribed the initial impetus of the world machine
to God, so Borelli, after giving a mechanical explanation of the
muscular processes, posited within the human body a soul from which all
animal motion took its origin. 63 Claude Perrault, architect and
physician, suggested (1680) that physiological actions that now seem
mechanical were formerly voluntary, guided by a soul, but became
mechanical through frequent repetition, like the formation of habits;
perhaps even the heart had once been controlled by the will. 64 Georg
Stahl argued (1702) that the chemical changes in living tissue are
different from those seen in laboratories, for in living animals, he
believed, the chemical changes are governed by an anima sensitiva which
pervades all parts of the body. The soul, said Stahl, directs every
physiological function, even digestion and respiration; it builds each
organ, indeed the whole body, as an instrument of desire. 65 Diseases,
he surmised, are proces- ses by which the soul strives to remove
something that hinders its opera- tions; and he foreshadowed a
twentieth- century “psychosomatic” theory by holding that disturbances
of the “sensitive soul” can produce bodily ailments. 66</p>
<p>In one form or another vitalistic conceptions held the ascendancy in
science till the second half of the nineteenth century. They yielded for
a time to the rising prestige of mechanical physics; and they were
revived, with the charm of literature, in Bergson’ s Creative Evolution
(1906). The debate will go on until the part understands the whole.</p>
<p>X. MEDICINE</p>
<p>The strongest stimulus to the biological sciences came from the needs
of medicine. Botany, before Ray, had been the handmaiden of
pharmacy.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>5 2 5</p>
<p>Health was the sumrnum bonum, and men, women, and children sought it
through prayers, stars, kings, toads, and science. One physician, before
prescribing, “went to his closet to pray,” says Aubrey, 67 so that at
last “his knees were horny” with orisons. Astrology still took a hand in
medi - cine; the surgeon in ordinary of Louis XIV advised that the King
be bled only in the first and last quar ters of the moon, “because at
this time the humors have retired to the center of the body.” 68 Defoe
thought that the money spent upon quacks would have paid off the
national debt. 69 Flam- steed, the astronomer royal, traveled miles to
have his back stroked by the famous quack Valentine Greatrakes, who
proposed so simply to cure scrofula. Perhaps Flamsteed was among the
100,000 whom Charles II touched for scrofula — the “King’s evil.” In the
one year 1682 the com - plaisant ruler touched 8,500 sufferers; in 1684
the press to get to him was so great that six of the sick were trampled
to death. William III refused to go on with the play. “It is a silly
superstition,” he exlaimed when a crowd besieged his palace. “Give the
poor creatures some money, a nd send them away.” On another occasion,
when he was importuned to lay his hand on a patient, he yielded, but
said, “God give you better health and more sense.” The people denounced
him as an infidel. 70</p>
<p>Defects of personal hygiene and public sanitation co-operated with
the resilient ingenuity of disease. Prostitution spread syphilis in
cities and camps. It was especially rife among actors and actresses, as
we gather from a subtle story in Mme. de Sevig ne of “a player who,
being resolved to marry though he labored under a certain dangerous
disorder, one of his companions said to him, ‘Zounds! can’t you wait
till you are cured? You will be the ruin of us all.’” 71 The French
general Vendome appeared a t court without a nose, having sacrificed it
to the spirochetes. 72 Cancer was on its way; Mme. de Motteville
describes a cancer of the breast. 73 Yellow fever was first described in
1694. Smallpox was especially widespread in England; no cure was yet
known for it; Queen Mary died of it, and</p>
<p>Marlborough’s son. Epidemics, particularly of malaria, ran through
whole countries; in 1657, reported Thomas Willis, almost all England was
a hospital treating malarial fever. 74 Plague devastated London in 1665,
killed 100,000 in Vienna in 1679, and 83,000 in Prague in 1681. 75
Occupational diseases increased with industry: Bernardino Ramazzini,
professor of medi- cine at Padua, issued in 1700 a classic treatise, De
morbis artificum, on the damage done to painters by the chemicals in
their paint, to workers in colored glass from antimony, to masons and
miners from tuberculosis, to potters from vertigo, to printers from eye
troubles, to physicians from the mercury they applied.</p>
<p>Amid ignorance and poverty the science of medicine slowly advanced.
The thirst for money hampered the profession; some doctors who had made
successful cures refused to reveal to other doctors the treatment
they</p>
<p>5 26</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>had used. 76 The medical members of the Royal Society rose above this
greed, and zealously shared their discoveries with their fellows. There
were now good medical schools, led by those at Leiden, Bologna, and
Montpellier; and generally a degree from a recognized institution was
re- quired for the legal practice of medicine in Western Europe. The
teachers of the art continued their division into two schools of
treatment. Borelli defended “iatrophysical” therapy, proposing to deal
with diseases as de - rangements of the body’s mechanism. Sylvius,
developing the arguments of Paracelsus and Helmont, advocated the
“iatrochemical” method of using drugs to counteract disturbances in the
“humours” of the body; most of these, he thought, were due to
hyperacidity. More fruitful than these general theories were discoveries
in the causes of specific diseases; so Sylvius first described tubercles
in the lungs, and related these morbid growths to consumption.</p>
<p>One of the most basic discoveries of this age was the work of that
re- markable Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher of Fulda, mathematician,
physicist, Orientalist, musician, and physician, and apparently the
first to use the microscope in investigating disease. 77 With this aid
he found that the blood of plague victims contained numberless “worms”
invisible to the naked eye. He saw similar animalcules in putrefying
matter, and ascribed putre- faction and many diseases to their activity.
He reported his findings in Scrutinium pestis (Rome, 1658), which first
stated in explicit terms what Fracastoro had only suggested in 1546 —
the doctrine that the transfer of noxious organisms from one person or
animal to another is the cause of infectious disease. 78</p>
<p>Medical treatment lagged behind medical research, for those who ex-
celled in research tended to form a class distinct from those who
practiced, and their communication was imperfect. Some medieval cures
were still prescribed. Aubrey records an untimely success: “A woman . .
. endeavored</p>
<p>Two Dutchmen were the greatest medical teachers of the age: Sylvius
and Boerhaave, both at Leiden. Hermann Boerhaave taught chemistry,
physics, and botany as well; students came to him from all northern
Europe; and he raised the status of clinical medicine by taking his
maturer pupils with him on his daily rounds of the hospital beds,
instructing them by direct observation and specific treatment of each
individual case. His works were translated into all major European
languages, even Turkish; his reputation reached to China itself.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST</p>
<p>5^7</p>
<p>In England clinical medicine had its finest exponent in Thomas Syden-
ham. After two stays at Oxford, separated by terms of service in the
army, he settled in London as a general practitioner. With little theory
and much experience, he came to his philo sophy of disease, which he
defined as “an effort of nature striving with all her might to restore
the health of the patient by eliminating morbid matter .” 81 He
distinguished “essential” symptoms as those caused by the foreign
substance, and “accidental” as those caused by the body’s resistance to
it; so fever is not an illness but a device of the organism in its
self-defense. The problem of the physician is to help this process of
defense. Hence Sydenham praised Hippocrates because the “Father of
Medicine”</p>
<p>required no more of art than to assist nature when she
languished,</p>
<p>and to check her when her efforts were too violent. … For this</p>
<p>sagacious observer found that nature alone terminates distemper,</p>
<p>and works a cure with the assistance of a few simple medicines, and
sometimes even without any medicines at all . 82</p>
<p>Sydenham’s distinction lay in recognizing that each major disease has
many varieties; he studied each case with its clinical record, in order
to diagnose the special form of the disease involved; and he adjusted
the treatment to the specific differences of the ailment. So he
separated scarlatina from measles, and gave it its current name. He was
known to his profession as “the English Hippocrates,” becau se he
subordinated theory to observation, general ideas to particular cases,
and drugs to natural cures. His Processus Integri remained for a century
the English practitioner’s manual of therapy.</p>
<p>Surgery continued to struggle for recognition as a reputable science.
Its ablest representatives found themselves pressed on either side by
the hos- tility of physicians and the envy of barbers — who still
performed some minor operations, including dentistry. Guy Patin, dean of
the faculty of medicine in the University of Paris, could not forgive
surgeons for assum- ing the dress and manners of the medical profession,
and he denounced all surgeons as “a race of evil, extravagant coxcombs
who wear mustaches and flourish razors .” 83 But in 1686 the surgeon
Felix operated successfully upon Louis XIV’s fistula; the King was so
pleased that he gave Felix fifteen thousand louis d’or, a country
estate, and a patent of nobility. This eleva - tion raised the social
status of surgeons in France. In 1699 surgery was decreed to be a
liberal art, and its exponents began to assume a high rank in French
society. Voltaire called surgery “the most useful of all the arts,”</p>
<p>English surgery, however, had at least two credits in this age: in
1662 J. D. Major made the first successful intravenous injection in man,
and in</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>1665-67 Richard Lower succeeded in transfusing blood from one animal
into the veins of another; Pepys noted this latter event in his diary.
85 From that private gossip sheet we gather that operations were usually
performed with only feeble anesthetics or none: when Pepys was operated
on for stone in his bladder he received no chloroform and no
antiseptics, but only “a soothing draught.” 86</p>
<p>Satires of the physician continued as in every generation. People re-
sented his fees, his pompous dress in gown, wig, and conical hat, his
grandiloquent speech, and his sometimes mortal mistakes. Boyle said that
many people feared the doctor more than the disease. 87 Moliere’s carica
- tures of the great profession were for the most part the good-natured
fun of a man who nevertheless took care to keep on amiable terms with
his physician. After all darts had been thrown it remained that the
seventeenth century had seen a creditable advance in medical science
through a hun- dred discoveries in anatomy, physiology, and chemistry,
that the inter- national exchange of medical knowledge was increasing,
that notable teachers were sending out able pupils to all parts of
Western Europe, that surgery was improving its methods and status, that
specialists were de- veloping greater knowledge and skill, and that more
measures were being taken to promote public health. Municipal
governments legislated sanita- tion. In 1656, when plague appeared in
Rome, Monsignor Gastaldi, papal commissioner of health, made mandatory
the cleansing of streets and sewers, the regular inspection of
aqueducts, the provision of public facili- ties for the disinfection of
clothing, and the requirement of health certifi- cates from all persons
entering the city. 88 As wealth rose, men built sturdier houses that
could keep rats at a respectful distance and so reduce the spread of
plague. Better supplies of water — the first necessity of civiliza- tion
— enabled the willing body to be clean. For more and more people it was
becoming physically possible to be civilized.</p>

<p>All in all, the seventeenth century was one of the peak periods in
the history of science. See it in its arching gamut, from Bacon calling
men to labor for the advancement of learning, and Descartes marrying
algebra to geometry; through the improvement of telescopes, microscopes,
baro- meters, thermometers, air pumps and mathematics; through Kepler’s
planetary laws, Galileo’s swelling firmament, Harvey’s charting of the
blood, Guericke’s obstinate hemispheres, Boyle’s skeptical chemistry,
Huygens’ multifarious physics, Hooke’s polymorphous tentatives, and
Halley’s cosmetary predictions, culminating in Leibniz’ notational
calculus</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE SCIENTIFIC QUEST 529</p>
<p>and Newton’s cosmic synthesis: what previous century had equaled
that</p>
<p>The influence of science spread in widening arcs. It affected
industry by supplying the physics and chemistry for new ventures in
technology. In education it compelled a lessening of emphasis on the
humanities — on literature, history, and philosophy; for the development
of industry, com- merce, and navigation demanded practical knowledge and
minds. Litera- ture itself felt the new influence: the scientist’s
pursuit of order, precision, and clarity suggested similar virtues in
poetry and prose, and accorded well with the classic style exemplified
by Moliere, Boileau, and Racine, by Addison, Swift, and Pope. The Royal
Society, according to its historian, required of its members “a close,
naked, natural way of speaking, . . . bringing all things as near to
mathematical plainness as the y can .” 90</p>
<p>The triumphs of mathematics and physics, giving period to comets and
laws to stars, affected philosophy and religion. Descartes and Spinoza
ac- cepted geometry as the ideal of philosophy and exposition. There
seemed no need, henceforth, to posit in the universe anything but matter
and motion. Descartes saw all the world, except the human and divine
mind, as a machine; Hobbes challenged the exception, and formulated a
ma- terialism in which even religion would be a tool of the state for
manipu- lating human machines. The new physics, chemistry, and astronomy
seemed to show a universe operating according to invariable laws; this
cosmos allowed no miracles, therefore answered no prayers, therefore
needed no God. Perhaps He could be kept to give the world machine an
inaugural push; but thereafter he might retire to be an
Epicurean-Lucretian deity, mindless of the world and men. Halley was
said to have assured a friend of Berkeley that “the doctrines of
Christianity” were now “incon - ceivable .” 91 Boyle, however, saw in
the revelations of science additional evidence of the existence of God.
“The world,” he wrote, “behaves as if there were diffused throughout the
universe an intelligent being”; a nd in a sentence recalling Pascal he
added, “The soul of man 〔is〕 a nobler and more valuable being than the
whole corporeal world .” 92 Dying, Boyle left a fund to finance lectures
that would demonstrate the truth of Christianity against “notorious inf
idels, viz., atheists, theists, pagans, Jews, and Mo- hammedans,” to
which he added a proviso that the lectures must not men - tion the
controversies among Christians . 93</p>
<p>Many scientists agreed with Boyle, and many believing Christians
joined in prais ing science. “In these last hundred years,” said Dryden
at the close of the century, “almost a new Nature has been revealed to
us — more errors . . . have been detected, more useful experiments have
been made,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>more noble secrets in optics, medicine, anatomy, and astronomy have
been discovered, than in all these doting and credulous ages from
Aristotle to us.” 94 This was a wild but significant exaggeration,
revealing the convic - tion of the “moderns” that they had won the
battle of the books with the “ancients.” In any case men could not but
see that the sciences were in - creasing human knowledge while religions
quarreled and statesmen warred. Science now rose to a new status of
honor among human enterprises; in- deed, by the end of this epoch it was
already being hailed as the harbinger of Utopia and the savior of
mankind. “The application of science to</p>
<p>nature,” said Fontenelle in 1702, “will constantly grow in scope and
in - tensity, and we shall go on from one marvel to another. The day
will come when man will be able to fly by fitting on wings to keep him
in the air; the art will increase, … till one day we shall be able to
fly to the moon.” 96 Everything was progressing except man.</p>
