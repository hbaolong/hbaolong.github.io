<p>XThe Play of the Mind</p>
<p>I. THE WORD INDUSTRY</p>
<p>T HE French language had now become the second tongue of every ed-
ucated European, the accepted medium of international diplomacy.
Frederick the Great used it regularly, except to his troops; Gibbon
wrote his first book in French, and for a time thought of writing in
French his history of declining Rome. In 1784 the Berlin Academy
announced a prize competition . for an essay explaining the causes of
this pre-eminence, and issued its own publications in French. The chief
causes were the political supremacy of France under Louiv XIV, the
spread of the French language by French troops in the Netherlands,
Germany, Austria, and Spain, the un- questioned superiority of French
literature on the Continent (England had reservations), the popularity
of Parisian society as the finishing school of the European elite, the
desire to replace Latin with a more modern and flexible speech in the
commerce of nations, and the purification and stand- ardization of the
French language by the French Academy through its Dictionary. Nowhere
had any vernacular reached such precision and variety, such point and
charm of phrase, such elegance and clarity of style. There were some
losses in this victory: French prose sacrificed the simple directness of
Montaigne, the rough and hearty vitality of Rabelais; French poetry
languished in the prison of Boileau’s rules. The Academy itself, until
Duclos aroused it after his election in 1746, had slipped into dreamy
formalism and cautious mediocrity.</p>
<p>The relative freedom of thought and speech under the Regency had en-
couraged the multiplication of authors, publishers, and libraries.
Printer- publisher-booksellers lurked everywhere, even though, as the
century ad- vanced, their trade became perilous; in Paris alone there
were 360, nearly all of them poor. Many towns now had circulating
libraries, and many libraries maintained reading rooms open to the
public for an admission fee of forty sous. Authorship seldom sufficed as
a way of life; it was usually appended to some other occupation; so the
elder Crebillon was a notary’s clerk, and Rousseau copied music. A few
famous writers could sell their product at a good price; Marivaux,
ruined by the collapse of Law’s System, retrieved his finances with his
plays and Marianne, and Rousseau, usually poor, received</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>X324</p>
<p>five thousand livres for Smile. The only copyright available was the
privi- lege du roi, or royal permission to publish; this protected the
author against the pirating of his book in France, but not against its
piratical printing abroad; it was granted only to manuscripts guaranteed
by official censors to contain nothing offensive to Church or state. New
ideas could surmount that barrier only through disguising their subject
matter or their heresies. This ruse failing, an author might send his
manuscript to Amsterdam, The Hague, Geneva, or some other foreign city,
to be printed there in French, distributed abroad, and circulated
clandestinely in France.</p>
<p>The expansion of the middle class, the spread of education, and the
gathering of intellect in Paris were generating an audience eager for
books, and a swarm of authors rose to saturate this demand. The
weakening of the state under Louis XV, and the decline of religious
belief, stimulated the oral and written discussion of political and
philosophical issues. The aristocracy, resenting both the monarchy that
had shorn it of power and the Church that was supporting the monarchy,
offered an interested hearing to criticism of the government and the
creed; and the upper middle class joined in this receptivity, hoping for
a change that would give them social equality with the nobility.</p>
<p>In this new atmosphere authors attained a status rarely accorded them
either before or after the eighteenth century. They were welcomed in the
salons, where they held forth with all the facility of their eloquence;
they were received in titled homes so long as they stepped upon no
titled toes; they were entertained and sometimes housed by financiers
like La Popelin- iere. Despite their poverty they became a force in the
state. “Of all em - pires,” said Duclos in 1751, “that of the men of
mind 〔 gens d’ esprit 〕, with- out being visible, is most widely
spread. Men of power can command, but men of intellect govern; for in
the long run . . . public opinion sooner or later overcomes or upsets
every form of despotism.” 1 (The technique of forming public opinion by
money or government had not yet been per- fected in 1751.)</p>
<p>Cheered on by a widening audience, stimulated by hundreds of alert
competitors, liberated by the decline of dogma, spurred by the vanity of
print, French writers now launched upon the inky sea such a flotilla of
let- ters, pamphlets, brochures, diatribes, essays, memoirs, histories,
novels, dramas, poems, theologies, philosophies, and pornography as
finally broke through all the chains of censorship, swept away all
resistance, and trans- formed the mind, the faith, and the government of
France and, in some measure, of the world. Never in literature had there
been such subtle wit, such delicate pleasantry, such coarse buffoonery,
such lethal ridicule. Every orthodoxy of Church or state trembled under
the assault of these sharply pointed, sometimes poisoned, usually
nameless, pens.</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>325</p>
<p>Even private correspondence became a public art. Men and women re-
vised, rewrote, polished their letters in the hope that these would
shine be- fore more eyes than two; and sometimes they succeeded so well
that their letters became belles-lettres, literature. Loving
conversation, they talked on paper to absent friends or enemies with all
the naturalness of face-to-face speech, all the sparkle and vitality of
exchanges across the table in salons. Such letters were no mere trivia
of personal news; they were in many cases discourses on politics,
literature, or art. Sometimes they were in verse — vers de societe —
bubbling with the rhymes that come so readily in French, and warm with
the hope of praise. So Voltaire delighted his friends with episto- lary
poems poured from the cornucopia of his agile mind and facile art.</p>
<p>The age of oratory was ending, for eighteenth-century France feared
to be bored, even by a Bossuet; it would return with the Revolution.
Memoirs were still in fashion, for, being letters to posterity, they
kept some of the charm of correspondence. It was at the end of this
period, in 1755, that the Memoir es of the Baronne de Staal de Launay,
who had died in 1750, at last reached print, recalling the days of the
Regency and the soirees de Sceaux; here, said Grimm, was a lady who
rivaled Voltaire himself in the excellence of her prose. 2</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE STAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>The theaters surpassed the salons in the place they held in the life
and affection of Paris. “The theater,” said Voltaire to Marmontel in
1745, “is the most enchanting of all careers. It is there that in one
day you may ob- tain glory and fortune. One successful piece renders a
man at the same time rich and celebrated.” 3 There were good theaters in
the provinces, there</p>
<p>All these theaters, and the Opera in the Palais-Royal, were spacious
el- lipses, with several tiers of boxes or seats for the perfumed few;
less aromatic spectators stood in the “parterre” (i.e., on the ground),
which we misname the orchestra; no seats were placed there till the
Revolution. As many as 1 50 extra-paying fops or devotees sat on the
stage, surrounding the action on three sides. Voltaire denounced this
custom as hampering the players and destroying the illusion. “Hence it
arises that most of our plays are noth - ing but long discourses; all
theatrical action is lost, or, if practiced, appears</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xridiculous.” 4 How, he asked, could a dramatist represent on such a
stage such a scene as Brutus and then Antony addressing the Roman
populace after Caesar’s assassination? Ho w could the poor Ghost in
Hamlet peek through these privileged anatomies? Hardly any of
Shakespeare’s plays could be presented under such conditions. 5
Voltaire’s vigorous protests, seconded by Diderot and others, finally
had effect, and by 1759 the stages of the French theaters were
cleared.</p>
<p>Voltaire had less success in his campaign to improve the theological
status of actors. Socially their condition had improved; they were
received in aris- tocratic homes, and in many cases they played at royal
command. But the Church still condemned the theater as a school for
scandal, held all actors to be ipso facto excommunicated, and forbade
their burial in consecrated ground — which included every cemetery in
Paris. Voltaire pointed the con- tradiction:</p>
<p>Actors are paid wages by the King, and excommunicated by the</p>
<p>Church; they are ordered by the King to play every evening, and for-
bidden to play at all by the ritual. If they do not play they are put
into prison 〔as happened when His Majesty’s Players went on strike〕;
if</p>
<p>they play they are 〔at death〕 cast into the sewers. We delight to
live with them, and object to be buried with them; we admit them to our
tables, and close our cemeteries to them. 6</p>
<p>Adrienne Lecouvreur, the greatest French actress of her time,
illustrated these antitheses in her life and death. Born near Reims in
1692, she came to Paris at the age of ten. Living near the
Theatre-Frangais, she found her way into it frequently, and imitated at
home the tragediennes whom she admired from the parterre. At fourteen
she organized a company of ama- teurs, which performed on private
stages. The actor Le Grand gave her lessons, and secured a place for her
in a troupe acting in Strasbourg. For years, like Moliere, she played in
the provinces, passing from role to role, and doubtless from one romance
to another. Longing for love, she found only lechers; two of them in
succession left her pregnant and refused her marriage; at eighteen she
bore a daughter, at twenty-four another. By 1715 she was back in Paris,
for young Voltaire met her there and then, and was for a time something
more than a friend. 7 In 1717 she was the leading lady at the
Theatre-Fran9ais, the haunt and aspiration of her youth.</p>
<p>Like many famous actresses, she was not particularly beautiful; she
was rather stout, and her features were irregular. But she had an
indescribable grace in carriage and manners, a seductive music in her
voice, a light of fire and feeling in her dark eyes, a mobile and noble
expression in her face; her every action expressed personality. She
refused to follow the oratorical style of speech that had been made
traditional in French acting by the long,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>3*7</p>
<p>rectangular form of the early theaters; she resolved to act her part
and speak her lines as naturally on the boards as in real life, except
for the distinct articulation and added volume of voice needed to carry
her words to the farthest auditors. In her brief career she accomplished
a revolution in his- trionic art. This was founded also in her depth of
feeling, her capacity to convey the passion and tenderness of love, the
full pathos or terror of a tragic scene. She excelled in the difficult
art of listening actively and ex- pressively while others spoke.</p>
<p>Old men praised her, youths lost their hearts and wits over her.
Young Charles Augustin de Ferriol, Comte d’Argental, who was to be the
“angel” and agent of Voltaire, developed for her an ardor that alarmed
his mother, who, fearing that he would propose marriage and be accepted,
vowed to send him to the colonies. When Adrienne heard of this she wrote
to Mme. de Ferriol (March 22, 1721) assuring her that she would
discourage the youth’s addresses:</p>
<p>I will write to him whatever you please. I will never see him
again</p>
<p>if you desire it. But do not threaten to send him to the end of
the</p>
<p>world. He can be useful to his country; he can be the delight of
his</p>
<p>friends; he will crown you with satisfaction and fame; you have only
to guide his talents and let his virtues act. 8</p>
<p>She was right; d’Argental rose to be a councilor of the Parlement of
Paris. In his eighty-fifth year, going through the papers his mother had
left, he came upon this letter, of which he had known nothing
before.</p>
<p>Adrienne in her turn experienced all the rapture and desolation of
love and rejection. Often to her performances came the young Prince
Maurice of Saxony, not yet swollen with victories, but so handsome and
romantic that when he pledged her his lifelong devotion she thought that
this was the hero she had long awaited. (When it comes to pledging
lifelong devo- tion men have as many lives as a cat.) She accepted him
as her lover (1721), and for a time they lived in such cooing fidelity
that Paris compared them to La Fontaine’s amorous turtledoves. But the
young soldier, already a marechal de camp, dreamed of kingdoms; we have
seen him running off to Kurland to seek a crown, half financed by
Adrienne’s savings.</p>
<p>She consoled herself in his absence by establishing a salon. It was
not without intellectual profit that she had learned the elegance of
Racine and the ideas of Moliere; she had become one of the best-educated
women in France. Her friends were not casual admirers, but men and women
who liked her mind. Fontenelle, Voltaire, d’Argental, the Comte de
Caylus came regularly to her dinners; and some titled ladies were glad
to join that spar- kling company.</p>
<p>In 1728 the defeated soldier of fortune returned to Paris. Absence
had</p>

<p>Xcooled his glands; he discovered that Adrienne was four years his
senior, being now thirty-six; and a dozen rich women were offering to
share his bed. One of them was almost as royal as himself, Louise de
Lorraine, Duch- esse de Bouillon, granddaughter of Poland’s noble hero
Jan Sobieski. She paraded Maurice so boldly in her box at the
Theatre-Fran§ais that Adrienne faced that box when, with some emphasis,
she recited angry lines from Racine’s Phedre:</p>
<p>Je ne mis point de ces femmes hardies</p>
<p>Qui, portant dans le crime une tranquille paix,</p>
<p>Ont m se faire un front qui ne rough jamais 9</p>
<p>—“I am not one of those brazen women who, bringing into crime a
〔show of〕 tranquil peace, have learned to put on a front that never
blushes with shame.”</p>
<p>In July, 1729, Simeon Bouret, abbe and painter of miniatures,
informed Mile. Lecouvreur that two masked agents of a court lady had
proposed to him to give the actress some poisoned pills, for which
service he was to re- ceive 6,600 livres. Adrienne notified the police.
They arrested the abbe and questioned him severely, but he persisted in
his story. She wrote a charac- teristic letter to the lieutenant of
police, asking him to free the abbe:</p>
<p>I have talked with him and made him talk often and for a long time,
and he always answered connectedly and intelligently. It is not that I
wish what he said to be true; I have a hundred times more reason to wish
he may be crazy. Ah, would to God I had only to solicit his par-</p>
<p>don! But if he is innocent, think, monsieur, what an interest I ought
to take in his fate, and how cruel this uncertainty is to me. Do not
con- sider my profession or my birth; deign to see my soul, which is
sincere and laid bare in this letter. 10</p>
<p>The Due de Bouillon, however, insisted that the abbe should be
detained. He was released several months later, still adhering to his
story. We do not yet know if it was true.</p>
<p>In February, 1730, Mile. Lecouvreur began to suffer from a diarrhea
that grew daily worse. She continued her roles at the theater, but early
in March she had to be carried from the theater in a faint. On March 15,
with her last strength, she played Jocaste in Voltaire’s Oedipe. On the
seventeenth she took to her bed, bleeding mortally from severe
inflammation of the bowels. The Marechal no longer came to her; only
Voltaire and d’Argental at - tended her in this tragic and humiliating
end. She died on March 20 in Voltaire’s arms.*</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1849 Eugene Scribe and Ernest Legouve produced in Paris their
successful but not quite accurate drama, Adrienne Lecouvreur ; and in
1902 Francesco Cilea composed an opera on the same theme.</li>

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>

<p>Since she had refused the last rites of the Church, 11 canon law
forbade her burial in consecrated ground. A friend engaged two
torchbearers to take her body in a hackney coach and bury her
clandestinely on the banks of the Seine, in what became the Rue de
Bourgogne. (In that same year 1730 Anne Oldfield, an English actress,
was buried with public honors in West- minster Abbey.) Voltaire wrote
(1730) a poem, La Mort de Mademoiselle Lecouvreur, passionately
denouncing the indignity of this burial.</p>
<p>Tons les coeurs sont emus de ma douleur mortelle,</p>
<p>J’entends de tous cotes les beaux-arts eperdus</p>
<p>S’ eerier en pleurant, “ Melpomene 12’ est plus!”</p>
<p>Que direz-vous, race future,</p>
<p>Lorsque vous apprendrez la fletrissante injure</p>
<p>Qu ’ a ces arts desoles font des hommes cruels?</p>
<p>lls privent de la sepulture</p>
<p>Celle qui dans la Grece aurait eu des autels.</p>
<p>Je les ai vus soumis, autour d’elles empresses;</p>
<p>Shot qu’elle n’est plus, elle est done criminelle!</p>

<p>lls contiennent ta cendre, et ce triste tombeau,</p>
<p>Honore par nos chants, consacre par tes mdnes,</p>
<p>Est pour nous un temple nouveau !*</p>
<p>The greatest dramatist of this period was, of course, Voltaire. He
had many rivals, among them Prosper Jolyot de Crebillon, an old survival
who should have been long since dead. From 1 705 to 1 7 1 1 Crebillon
had produced successful plays; then, convinced by the decided failure of
his Xerxes (1714) and Semiramis (1717) that he was through, he had
retired from authorship, and fallen into a poverty consoled in his
garret by his tender collection of ten dogs, fifteen cats, and some
ravens. In 1 745 Mme. de Pom- padour rescued him with a pension and a
sinecure, and arranged for an edi- tion of his collected works to be
published by the government press. He came to Versailles to thank her;
ill, she received him while she remained in her bed; as he bent to kiss
her hand Louis XV entered. “Madame,” cried the septuagenarian, “I am
undone; the King has surprised us together.” 12 Louis enjoyed this flash
of wit, and joined Pompadour in urging him to complete # “All hearts are
moved like mine by mortal grief. I hear on every side the distracted
arts</p>
<p>33 »</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xhis abandoned play on Catiline. She and the court attended and
applauded the premiere (1748), and Crebillon again thrilled with fame
and francs. In 1754, a g e d eighty, he produced his last play- He
survived eight years more, happy with his animals.</p>
<p>Voltaire did not enjoy this appearance of a competitor from the
grave. But he had also to face, in comedy, the rivalry of the versatile
and effer- vescent Marivaux. Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux
became a satirist when, by chance, he saw his seventeen-year-old
sweetheart practicing her seductive charms before a mirror. His heart
was only momentarily sprained, for his father was the rich director of
the mint at Riom, and many a young lady yearned to be Pierre’s wife. He
married for love, and surprised Paris by leading a life of sexual
sobriety. He joined the salon of Mme. de Tencin, and may have learned
there the gay wit, elegant phrasing, and subtle feeling that went into
the marivaudage of his plays.</p>
<p>His first success was Arlequin poli par /’ amour, which ran for
twelve suc - cessive nights at the Theatre des Italiens in 1720. Just as
he was sipping his royalties he lost most of his money in the crash of
Law’s bank. We are told that he retrieved his fortune with his pen, 13
writing a long succession of comedies that amused Paris with their
graceful badinage and clever plots. The most famous of them, Le Jeu de T
amour et du hasard ( The Game of Love and Chance ) , turned on the
simultaneous but unconcerted resolve of two couples to test the devotion
of their as-yet-unseen fiance (e)s by an exchange of garb and manner
between master and man, mistress and maid, developing through a
concatenation of coincidences as absurd as Desde- mona’s handkerchief.
The women of Paris were better pleased than the men with the love
tangles in these plays, and their tender sentiment. Here too, as in
Versailles and the salons, as in Watteau and Boucher, woman ruled, and
had the deciding word; and the analysis of feeling replaced the prob-
lems of politics and the heroics of war. The masculine comedy of Moliere
gave way before the feminine comedy that ruled the French stage (barring
Beaumarchais) to the days of Scribe, Dumas fils, and Sardou.</p>

In 1731 he published Part I of La Vie de Marianne. It was well received;
he continued to offer further installments until 1741, when there were
eleven; he left it unfinished (though he survived till 1763) because his
aim had been not so much to tell a tale as to analyze character,
particularly in woman, especially in love. Nothing could be more
arresting than the open- ing scene: a band of robbers hold up a
stagecoach, and kill everybody in it</p>

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>

<p>except Marianne, who survives to tell the story in her old age. The
heroine and supposed author keeps her intriguing anonymity to the end;
she trans- mits the manuscript to a friend with the caution, “Do not
forget that you have promised never to say who I am; I wish to be known
only to you.” 14</p>
<p>As her parents were among the casualties, Marianne is brought up by a
charitable bourgeoise, becomes a salesgirl in a lingerie shop, and
swells into charms that arouse M. de Climal. He brings her small gifts,
then costly gifts, and soon asks for her person as his reward. She
rejects him, and sends back his presents after some hesitations which
Marivaux describes with delicate understanding. We should have said that
meanwhile she had met Climal’s nephew, M. de Valville, who has less
money than his uncle, but also less years. Valville, however, keeps
Marianne in suspense for a thousand pages, and goes off with another
woman; at which point Marivaux’s story ends.</p>
<p>This was the outstanding psychological novel of eighteenth-century
France, to be rivaled only by Choderlos de Laclos’ Liaisons dangereuses
( 1 782 ) . It recalled Mme. de La Fayette’s Princesse de Cleves (1678),
hardly equaled it in delicacy of feeling or beauty of style, but
surpassed it in the dissection of motive and sentiment. Here is a woman
who, like Richard- son’s Pamela, preserves her honor, but for its
marketable worth; she knows that women have only frail and perishable
values to offer for the monoga- mous support of the polygamous male. It
is a subtler picture than Richard- son’s. Pamela (1740) was begun nine
years after Marianne , and may have been influenced by it; in return
Richardson’s Clarissa (1747) helped Rous - seau’s La Nouvelle
Helo’ise.</p>
<p>Marivaux reflected the sturdy and cautious morals of the middle
class; Crebillon fils found his interest in the reckless license of the
aristocracy. Known as “Crebillon le gai” in contrast to his father,
“Crebillon le tra - gique” (who called his son the worst of his many
productions), Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crebillon grew up in the Paris of
the Regency, whose morals quite outweighed his Jesuit education. For
several years he shared his father’s garret, ravens, dogs, and cats. In
1734, aged twenty -seven, he achieved fame by his novel Vfscumoire — T
he Surface-Skimmer; this might have been the title of all his heroes and
books, for in them love, as Chamfort put it, is merely the “contact of
two skins.” 15 The story was laid in Japan, but it was so transparent a
satire on Church and state in France, and on the tiny Duchesse du Maine
(“the Fairy Cucumber”), that Cardinal Fleury banished him from Paris for
five years.</p>
<p>Returning, the author issued in 1740 his most notorious novel, Le
Sopha , which earned him a briefer banishment. The scene was Agra, but
the morals were Parisian. The “sultan” is bored, and calls for stories.
The young cour - tier Amanzei obliges by telling how, in a previous
incarnation, he had been a sofa; and he recalls some of the sins that
had tested his springs. The sue-</p>
<p>332 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xcession of adulteries is increasingly detailed. Crebillon took
special delight in the story of Almahide and Mochles, who, after verbose
boasting of their chastity, confess that their thoughts are as unchaste
as other people’s con - duct; they conclude that there could be no
greater guilt in the action than in the thought; whereupon they suit the
deed to the word. This, however, was an exceptional case; Crebillon’s
women usually require some financial quid for their quo; so Amina
counted her quid carefully, and “complied with her lover’s desire only
after she had made quite sure that he had not blundered in his
arithmetic.” 16</p>
<p>The book had its calculated success, and found readers in many lan-
guages, all addicted to irregular conjugations. Laurence Sterne
confessed to having been influenced by the novels of Crebillon; Horace
Walpole pre- ferred them to Fielding’s; the virtuous Thomas Gray’s
conception of Par a- dise was “to read eternally new romances by
Marivaux and Crebillon.” 17 Lady Henrietta Stafford rushed over from
England, became Crebillon’s mistress, the mother of his child, then his
wife; we are told that he “made her a model husband.” 18 In 1752 he
joined Alexis Piron and Charles Colle in founding the Caveau (Cave), a
club for gay wits notable for irreverence and pranks. In 1759, by a
reductio ad absurdum, he was appointed royal censor of literature; and
when, after irritating delays, his father died (1762), the son inherited
his pension. All’s well that ends well.</p>
<p>Crebillon’s books lost their popularity long before his death, but
mean - while a learned cleric had written a novel that still lives and
moves today. The life of Antoine Francois Prevost d’Exiles, known as the
Abbe Prevost, was as varied and troubled as the careers that came from
his pen. Born in Artois in 1697, educated by the Jesuits, he became a
novice in the Jesuit order (1713), left it to join the army, worked his
way up to a commission, fell in love, suffered a broken heart, and
became a Benedictine monk (1719) and priest (1726). Thenceforth,
marvelous to relate, he supported himself almost entirely by his
pen.</p>
<p>Even before abandoning monastic life he had begun a romance, Me-
moires et aventures d’un hovrme de qualite, of which the first four
volumes were published at Paris in 1728. After a year in England he
moved to Holland. In 1730 he began to publish a second romance, Le
Philosophe anglais, ou Histoire de Monsieur Cleveland, fils naturel de
Cromwell; this — one of the earliest historical novels — he drew out to
eight volumes in the next nine years. In 1731 he published at Amsterdam
Volumes V-VII of the Memoir es; Volume VII was separately published at
Paris (1731) as Les Aventures du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon
Lescaut, par Monsieur D. It was forbidden by the French government, and
entered at once upon its still continuing popularity. “Paris,” we are
told, “went wild over it; . . . people rushed for the book as if to a
fire.” 19</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>The story of Manon is enclosed in a clumsy mechanism of make-believe.
Twelve prostitutes are in a vehicle en route to Le Havre for deportation
to</p>
<p>America. The Marquis , the nameless “man of quality” who is
supposed</p>
<p>to author all seven volumes of the Memoir es, is struck by the beauty
of one of the girls, whose face is later described as one “that could
bring back the world to idolatry .” 20 He s ees also the desolate
Chevalier des Grieux, who gazes in tears at his former mistress, Manon,
and mourns that he is too bank- rupt to follow her into exile. The
Marquis, doubly touched, gives Des Grieux four louis d’or, which enabled
the Chevalier to ac company Manon to Louisiana. Two years later the
Marquis sees him at Calais, and takes him home. The remainder of the
little volume is Des Grieux’s account of his romance.</p>
<p>He was an exemplary, wellborn youth, who excelled in everything at
college in Amiens. His parents intended him for the order of the Knights
of Malta, and in their fond hopes “they already had me wearing the</p>
<p>Cross .” 21 But Manon passed by, and all was changed. She was then
fifteen; he was seventeen, and “had never give n a thought to the
difference of the sexes.” This arrested development was at once
accelerated. Manon tells him that she has been sent to Amiens, against
her will, to become a nun. He offers to rescue her; they elope to Paris.
Their mutual admiration seemed a sufficient covenant; “we dispensed with
the rites of the Church, and found ourselves man and wife without having
given it a thought.” His brother discovers him, has him arrested, and
takes him back to the father, who in- forms him that Manon has already
become the mistress of the banker Mon- sieur B. Des Grieux proposes to
go and kill B.; the father locks up his son. A friend, Tiburge, comes,
confirms the claim that Manon is B.’s mistress, and urges Des Grieux to
take holy orders. The youth enters the Seminary of St.- Sulpice, and
becomes an abbe. “I thought myself absolutely purged from the wickedness
of love.” Two years later he comes up for public examination and
disputation at the Sorbonne. Manon is in the audience; she makes her way
to him, confesses her infidelity, but swears that she has sinned with B.
only to raise money for Des Grieux. They elope again.</p>
<p>They take a house in suburban Chaillot. They live expensively on the
sixty thousand francs received by Manon from Monsieur B.; Des Grieux,
dis-abbeed and re-chevaliered, hopes to win forgiveness and francs from
his father, or to inherit property on his father’s death. They are
robbed, and find themselves suddenly penniless. “I realized then that
one can love money without being a miser. … I knew Manon; . . . however
faithful and</p>
<p>fond she might be in good fortune, one could not count on her in
want. She cared too much for pleasure and plenty to sacrifice them for
me .” 22 And he loves her more than honor. He lets her brothers teach
him how to cheat at cards. He wins a small fortune, but is robbed again.
Manon leaves him for</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xa wealthy old voluptuary, explaining in a note, “I am working to
make my Chevalier rich and happy.” He joins with her in a plot to get
money out of the old man; they succeed, abscond, are arrested. She is
committed to the common hospital as a prostitute, he is Sent to a
monastery. From this he es- capes by shooting dead the porter who guards
the gate. He borrows money and bribes the hospital attendants to let
Manon escape. She vows eternal love.</p>
<p>When their funds are exhausted she allows a moneyed heir to set her
up as mistress. She is again arrested, and Des Grieux’s father persuades
the au - thorities to deport her. Des Grieux attempts to rescue her en
route; failing, he embarks with her to New Orleans. There she learns to
bear poverty, and to give Des Grieux complete fidelity. They return to
the practices of re- ligion. But the colonial governor’s son falls in
love with her. As she and Des Grieux have still neglected to secure a
legal marriage, the governor ex- ercises his right to assign her to any
colonist; he bids her accept his son. Des Grieux kills the son in a
duel. He and Manon escape from New Orleans into the wilderness, on foot.
After weary miles she faints, and dies. “For two days and two nights I
stayed with my lips pressed to the face and hands of my dear Manon.” He
digs he r grave there with his hands, buries her, and lies down on the
grave to die. But his good friend Tiburge, who meanwhile has come from
France, finds him, and takes him back to Calais, to the Mar- quis, to
tell his tale.</p>
<p>Manon Lescaut became the fountainhead of a Mississippi of romans lar-
moyants, romances wet with tears. Every woman, even if she is not “at
heart a rake,” weeps over Manon’s grave and Des Grieux’s grief,
forgiving her financial stratagems and his caitiff crimes. Prevost
struck a new note by endowing his hero and heroine with so many faults;
he made them real by baring Manon’s supreme love of pleasure, and her
lover’s capacity for para - sitism, cheating, theft, and homicide; she
is an old type of heroine, he is assuredly a new type of hero. The book
might have reached a starker power had he been left to die on Manon’s
grave.</p>
<p>Perhaps Prevost told the story with such feeling because he had
himself all the ardor of Des Grieux. It was an autobiography before the
event. But he was no parasitic idler. He translated the three enormous
novels of Rich- ardson into French, and these translations inaugurated
in France that craze for Richardson which found such diverse expression
in Rousseau and Dide- rot. He translated Middleton’s Life of Cicero, and
Hume’s History of Eng - land. He wrote several minor novels, and many
volumes of the Histoire generate des voyages. In 1733, at Amsterdam, he
fell in love with another man’s mistress. Learning that the Benedictines
had secured an order for his imprisonment, he fled to England, taking
the lady with him. In London he earned his bread by tutoring. On
December 1 5 he was arrested on a charge</p>

<p>by one of his pupils that he had forged a note for fifty pounds — a
crime for which the statutory penalty was death. He was soon released,
for reasons unknown. He returned to France (1734) and rejoined the
Benedictine order. In 1753 he was appointed to the Priory of
St.-Georges-de-Gennes.</p>
<p>His death, ten years later, led to a legend told as fact by his
grandniece to Sainte-Beuve: that Prevost was stricken with apoplexy
while walking in the woods of Chantilly; that a doctor, thinking him
dead, cut him open to find the cause of his death; that Prevost was
still alive, but that the post-mortem killed him. 23 The story is now
generally rejected. 24</p>
<p>Pr evost’s influence was immense. It shared in shaping Rousseau’s La
Nou - velle Helo’ise; it moved the tough-minded, tenderhearted Diderot
to write sentimental drames larmoyants; it took a completely idealistic
turn in Ber- nardin de Saint- Pierre’s Paul et Virginie; it reappeared
in the Dame aux camelias (1848) of Dumas fils; it played a part in the
Romantic movement till Flaubert introduced Madame Bovary (1857); and
Manon still lives and dies in opera.</p>

<li>MINOR SAGES</li>
</ol>
<p>Another abbe returns to our story, and this time we must give him his
due. We have seen Charles Irenee Castel, Abbe de Saint-Pierre, shocking
the diplomats at Utrecht (1712) with Memoir e pour rendre la paix per-
petuelle, which was to fascinate both Rousseau and Kant. And we have
seen him proposing to the Club de l’Entresol a medley of ideas and
reforms so ad - vanced that Cardinal Fleury felt inspired to close the
club and save the state (1731). What were these ideas?</p>
<p>Like so many rebels, his mind was sharpened by a Jesuit education. It
did not take him long to shed the popular faith; and though he continued
to profess Catholicism, he did it some sly damage by his Discourse
against Mohammedanism, in which his argumen ts, like Voltaire’s in
Mahomet, could readily be applied to orthodox Christianity. His Physical
Explanation of “the pretended miracles told by Protestants, schismatics,
and Mohamme - dans” was obviously intended to question Catholic miracles
as well.</p>
<p>In 1717, and again in 1729, he republished in expanded form his
Projet de paix perpetuelle. He pleaded with the sovereigns of Europe,
including the Sultan, to enter into a sacred pact that would mutually
guarantee their pres- ent possessions, would renounce war as a means of
settling international dis- putes, and would submit these to a European
Union armed with force to compel the acceptance of its decisions. He
drew up a model charter for the Union, with rules of procedure for its
assembly, and specified the financial contributions to be made to the
Union by each member state. He could not</p>
<p>33 &lt;*</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xbe expected to foresee that the Congress of Vienna (1815) would form
on these lines a Holy Alliance to perpetuate monarchical and feudal
institu- tions, and suppress all revolutionary movements.</p>
<p>No difficulties could shake the confidence of the resilient abbe.
He</p>
<p>adopted with religious ardor the rising faith in progress; and in
Observations on the Continuous Progress of Universal Reason (1737) he
proclaimed, long before Condorcet, the indefinite perfectibility of
mankind through the agency of reason in scientists and governments.
After all, he mused, the human race, on accepted authority, is not more
than seven or eight thou- sand years old; therefore it is only “in the
infancy of reason”; what may we not expect of its virile youth six
thousand years hence, and of its glorious flowering in the maturity of
mankind a hundred thousand years from now? 25</p>
<p>Saint-Pierre foresaw our modern problem: that while science and
knowl- edge have made immense advances, there has been no commensurate
prog- ress in morals or politics; knowledge implements vice as much as
it en- lightens morality. How could the growth of knowledge be turned to
the improvement of conduct in individuals and nations? In A Project to
Perfect the Governments of States (1737) Saint-Pierre proposed the
formation of a Political Academy, to be composed of the wisest men in
the land, and to act as an advisory body to the ministers of state in
matters of social or moral reform. He made many specific proposals:
universal education under gov- ernmental (not ecclesiastical) control,
religious toleration, marriage of the clergy, the unification of French
laws, the promotion of public welfare by the state, and the enlargement
of national revenues by progressive taxes on incomes and inheritances.
26 The abbe in 1725 added to the French language the word bienfaisance,
beneficence, to distinguish the humanitarianism that he preferred to the
condescending charities of the Old Regime. And long before Helvetius and
Bentham he laid down the utilitarian principle that “the value of a
book, of a regul ation, of an institution, or of any public work is
proportioned to the number and grandeur of the actual pleasures it pro-
duces, and of the future pleasures which it is calculated to procure for
the greatest number of men.” 27 Most of the basic ideas o f the
philosophes ap- peared as a prelude in Saint-Pierre, even to the hope
for an enlightened king as an agent of reform. With all his simplicity,
naivete, and prolixity he was one of the seminal minds of the
Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Charles Pinot Duclos must have scorned him as a visionary quite
uncon- genial to a realistic mind. Born at Dinan in Brittany, he kept to
the end the sturdy, cautious, obstinate character of the Breton. Son of
a well-to-do bourgeois, and of a mother who died at 101, he had in him
the iron to sur- vive his wild youth in the Paris of the Regency. He
received his higher edu-</p>

<p>337</p>
<p>cation from the Jesuits and the filles de joie, sowing wild oats
lavishly and sharpening his wit in the cafes. Soon his reputation for
repartee gave him access to society and the salons. He added to his fame
with a novel, Histoire de la baronne de Luz (1741), which was almost an
indictment of God. The Baroness repels all other assaults upon her
marital fidelity, but yields herself to a corrupt magistrate to save the
life of her husband, implicated in a con- spiracy against the King. She
is twice raped. In hysterical anger she cries out, “Cruel Heaven! In
what way have I deserve d your hatred? Can it be that virtue is hateful
to you?” 28</p>
<p>Despite the tenor and eroticism of this book Duclos was elected to
the Academy in 1746 through the influence of Mme. de Pompadour. He en-
tered vigorously into its operations, reorganized it, and brought it
into vitalizing touch with the literature and philosophy of the time. In
1751 he succeeded Voltaire as historiographer to the King; in 1754 he
maneuvered the election of d’Alembert to the Academy; in 1755 he was
elected its per - manent secretary, and remained its dominating spirit
till his death. He won the Academy to liberal ideas, but he deplored the
precipitancy of d’Hol - bach, Helvetius, and Diderot. “This band of
little atheists,” he said, “will end by driving me back to the conf
essional.”</p>
<p>We remember him chiefly for his Considerations sur les moeurs de ce
siecle (1750),* a work of calm and often penetrating analysis of French
morals and character. Written before he was forty-five, it begins with
the solemnity of a senile sag e: “I have lived; I wish to be useful to
those who shall live.” He regrets that “the most civilized peoples are
not also the most virtuous.”</p>
<p>The happiest epoch would be that in which virtue would not be con-
sidered a merit. When it begins to be remarked, manners are already
altered; and if it becomes an object of ridicule, that is the last stage
of corruption. 29</p>
<p>“The great defect of the Frenchman,” in his judgment, “is to have
always a youthful character; thereby he is often amiable, rarely stable;
he has al- most no age of maturity, but passes from youth to
decrepitude. . . . The Frenchman is the child of Europe” 30 — just as
Paris is its playground. Duclos does not entirely sympathize with the
Age of Reason, which he feels swirl- ing around him: “I am not sure that
I have too high an opinion of my cen - tury, but it seems to me that a
certain fermentation of reason tends to de- velop everywhere.” 31</p>
<ul>
<li>This was followed in 1751 by Memoires pour s ervir de suite aux
Considerations. Duclos’ Memoir es secrets sur les regnes de Louis XIV et
de Louis XV was not published till 1791. Part of this was translated
into English as Secret Memoirs of the Regency.</li>

<p>338</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XWe declaim a great deal in these days against prejudices; perhaps we
have too much destroyed them. Prejudice is a kind of common law</p>
<p>among men. … In this matter I cannot avoid blaming those writers</p>
<p>who, … wishing to attack a superstition (a motive that could be</p>
<p>praiseworthy and useful if the discussion were kept on a
philosophical plane), sap the foundations of morality and weaken the
bonds of so- ciety. . . . The sad effect which they produce on their
readers is to</p>
<p>make, of the young, bad citizens and scandalous criminals, and to en-
gender unhappiness in old age. 32</p>
<p>Grimm, the Parisian correspondent of foreign dignitaries, was one of
many who resented these delicate aspersions on philosophy by one who had
sampled many bosoms — “When one has a cold heart and a spoiled taste, he
should not write on morals and the arts”; 33 but Grimm had been Duclos’
rival for the favors of Mme. d’fipinay. The Memoires of that tender lady
picture Duclos as rough and tyrannical in possession, and coarsely
bitter in defeat; but Grimm edited those Memoires. If we may believe
these hot and tearful pages, Madame drove Duclos from her home as a
treacherous satyr. The learned Academician wandered to other beds and
other lands, and so, at sixty-seven, to death.</p>
<p>Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, was more lovable. At the
age of eighteen he joined the army, drunk with Plutarch and with
ambition to earn glory in the service of the King. He took part in the
disastrous adven- ture of Marechal de Belle-Isle in the Bohemian
campaign of 1741-43; in the bitter retreat from Prague his legs were
frozen; he fought at Dettingen (1743), but his health was so impaired
that he was soon afterward retired from the army. He sought employment
as a diplomat, and through Vol- taire’s help was on the point of
securing it, when an attack of smallpox dis - figured his face. His
eyesight began to fail, and a chronic consumptive cough disabled him
from active life.</p>
<p>Books became his consolation . After all, he said, “the best things
are the most common; you can purchase the mind of Voltaire for a crown.”
34 He warned against judging books by their weight; “even the best
authors talk too much,” and many are ponderously obscure; “clearness is
th e ornament of deep thought.” 35 The volume that he himself sent to

<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>years before Rousseau’s idealization of nature and equality, he
pictured “nature” as a brutal struggle for power, and equality as a
delusion.</p>
<p>Among kings, among peoples, among individuals, the stronger gives
himself rights over the weaker, and the same rule is followed by ani-
mals and inanimate beings, so that everything in the universe is exe-
cuted by violence; and this order, which we blame with some sem-</p>
<p>blance of justice, is the most general law, the most immutable, and
the most important in nature . 37</p>
<p>All men are born unfree and unequal.</p>
<p>It is not true that equality is a law of nature. Nature has made
nothing equal; her sovereign law is subordination and dependence. . . .
He</p>
<p>who is born to obey will obey even on the throne . 38</p>
<p>As for free will, that too is a myth. “The will is never the first
cause of an action, it is the last spring.” If you give the classic
instance of free will, that - ever, is indispensable; only through that
faith, Vauvenargues felt, could life and history have any meaning other
than everlasting strife and final defeat . 40</p>
<p>The most individual feature of Vauvenargues’ philosophy is his
defense of the passions. They must not be destroyed, for they are the
root of per- sonality, genius, and all vigor of thought.</p>
<p>The mind is the eye of the soul, but not its force. Its force is in
the</p>
<p>heart; that is to say, in the passions. The most enlightened reason
does not give us the power to act and to will. . . . 41 Great thoughts
come from the heart. . . . Perhaps we owe to the passions the greatest
ac- complishments of the intellect. . . , 42 Reason and feeling advise
and supplement each other turn by turn. Whoever consults only one of</p>
<p>them, and renounces the other, foolishly deprives himself of a part
of the resources given us for our conduct . 43</p>
<p>Vauvenargues admitted the pervasiveness of self-love, but refused to
con- sider it a vice, since it is the first necessity of nature’s first
law, self -preserva- tion. Neither is ambition a vice, it is a necessary
spur; “the love of glory makes great careers of nations .” 44 He adds
that “one is not born to glory if he does not recognize the value of
time .” 45 There are real vices, however, which must be controlled by
laws and moral codes; and “the science of government lies in guiding
them 〔vices〕 to the public good .” 46 There are</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xreal virtues too, and “the first days of spring have less grace and
charm than the growth of virtue in a youth.” 47</p>
<p>Despite his concessions to Hobbes and La Rochefoucauld, and despite
his own experience of evil in life, Vauvenargues kept his faith in
mankind. Said his friend Marmontel:</p>
<p>He knew the world and did not despise it. Friend of men, he ranked
vice among the misfortunes 〔rather than among the crimes〕 of men, and
pity held in his heart the place of indignation and hatred. . . .</p>
<p>He never hu mi liated anyone. . . . An unalterable serenity concealed
his pains from the eyes of his friends. To sustain adversity one needed
only his example; seeing the equanimity of his spirit, we did not dare
be unhappy before him. 48</p>
<p>Voltaire described him as “the most unfortunate of men, and the most
tranquil.” 49</p>
<p>One of the most gracious aspects of French literature in the
eighteenth century is the warm sympathy and friendly aid that Voltaire,
apostle of reason, extended to Vauvenargues, defender of Pascal and the
“heart.” The youthful philosopher confessed his admiration for “ a man
who honors our century, and who is not less great, nor less celebrated,
than his predeces- sors.” 50 And the older man wrote to him in a moment
of modesty: “If you had been born a few years earlier, my writings would
have had more worth.” 51 The most eloquent passage in all the hundred
volumes of Voltaire is his funeral eulogy of Vauvenargues. 52</p>

<p>Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brede et de Montesquieu, was
born at La Brede, near Bordeaux in the country of Montaigne, on January
18, 1689. He boasted good-humoredly of descent from those Goths who,
after conquering the Roman Empire, “established everywhere monarchy and
liberty.” 53 In any c ase he belonged to the nobility, both of sword and
of robe: his father was chief justice at Guienne, and his mother brought
as her dowry the castle and domain of La Brede. At the moment of his
birth a beggar presented himself at the castle gate; he was brought in
and fed,</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>341</p>
<p>and was made the godfather of the child, allegedly in the hope that
Charles would never forget the poor. 54 The boy’s first three years were
spent at nurse among the village peasants. At eleven he was sent to the
college of the Oratorians at Juilly, twenty miles from Paris. At sixteen
he returned to Bordeaux to study law; at nineteen he received his law
degree.</p>
<p>The death of his father (1713) left him, at twenty-four, considerable
property and moderate wealth; he was to speak frequently of “my domain”
and “my vassals,” 55 and we shall find him firmly upholding feudalism. A
year later he was admitted to the Bordeaux Parlement as a councilor and
magistrate. In 1 7 1 6 his uncle, who had bought the presidency of the
Parle- ment, bequeathed to him his fortune and his office. Later
Montesquieu would defend “the sale of employments” as “good in
monarchical states, because it makes it the profession of persons of
family to undertake tasks which they would not assume from disinterested
motives alone.” 58 While retaining the presidency of the Parlement, he
spent most of his time in study. He made experiments, presented papers
on physics and physiology to the Academy of Bordeaux, and planned a
“geological history of the earth.” He never wrote it, but the material
he gathered for it forced its way into The Spirit of Laws.</p>
<p>He was thirty-two when he caught the mood and ear of Regency Paris
with the most brilliant of his books. He did not give his name to the
Lettres persanes (1721), for it contained passages hardly becoming a
magistrate. Probably he took its scheme from VEspion du Grand Seigneur
(1684) of Giovanni Marana, in which an imaginary Turkish spy reported to
the sultan, with some fetching ribaldry, the absurd beliefs and behavior
of the Christians of Europe, and the delightful or murderous contrasts
between Christian professions and practices. A similar device of
picturing Occiden- tal civilization as seen through Oriental eyes had
been used in Addison’s Spectator; Charles Dufresny, in Amusements
serieux et comiques, had conceived the comments of a Siamese in Paris;
Nicolas Gueudeville had shown French customs as seen by an American
Indian. Antoine Galland’s translation of the Arabian Nights — Mille et
une Nuits (1704-17) — had sharpened French interest in Mohammedan life;
so had the travelogues of Jean (Sir John) Chardin and Jean Tavernier.
From March to July, 1721, the Turkish ambassador treated Paris to the
exotic charm of his dress and ways. Paris was ready for the Lettres
persanes. Eight editions were sold out within a year.</p>
<p>Montesquieu presented the letters as written by Rica and Usbek, two
Persians traveling in France, and by their correspondents in Isfahan.
The letters did not merely expose the foibles and prejudices of the
French; they revealed also, through the writers themselves, the
absurdities of Oriental conduct and creeds; laughing at these faults,
the reader was compelled to</p>
<p>34 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xaccept with good grace the ridicule of his own. It was done with so
light a touch — who could take offense at these unconscious epigrams,
these rapier thrusts with politely buttoned foils? Moreover, certain of
the letters con- tained alluring confidences from Usbek’s seraglio in
Isfahan. Zachi, his fa - vorite, writes to tell him how painfully she
misses his passion; and Rica de- scribes a Mohammedan l ady’s conception
of Paradise as a place where every good woman has a harem of handsome
and virile men. Here Montesquieu let himself go into details in the
reckless style of the Regency.</p>
<p>Only during that interregnum could the political and religious
heresies of the Lettres have escaped official rebuke. The old King was
dead, the new one was a boy, the Regent was tolerant and gay; now
Montesquieu could make his Persians laugh at a “magician” ruler who made
people be - lieve that paper was money (Law’s System had just crashed ).
57 He could expose the corruption of the court, the idleness of
spendthrift nobles, the maladministration of state finances. He could
praise the ancient republics of Greece and Rome, and the modern
republics of Holland and Switzer- land. “Monarchy,” says Usbek, “is an
abnormal condition which always degenerates into despotism .” 58 (See
below for a different view.)</p>
<p>Ip Letters XI-XIV Usbek illustrates the nature of man and the problem
of government by telling of the Troglodytes, whom he conceives to be
Arabian descendants of the Troglodytai described by Herodotus 59 and
Aristotle 60 as bestial tribes living in Africa.* Usbek’s Troglodytes,
resenting governmental interference, killed thinking magistrates, and
lived in a para- dise of laissez- faire. Every seller took advantage of
the consumer’s need, and raised the price of the product. When a strong
man stole the wife of a weak man there was no law^ormagistrate to appeal
to. Murder, rape, and robbery went unpunished except by private
violence. When the inhabitants of the highlands suffered from drought,
the lowlanders let them starve; when the lowlanders suffered from flood
the highlanders let them starve. Soon the tribe died out. Two families
survived by emigration; they prac- ticed mutual aid, raised their
children in religion and virtue, and “looked upon themselves as one
single family; their flocks were almost always in- termixed .” 61 But as
they increased in number they f ound their customs in- adequate to
govern them; they chose a king, and submitted to laws. Usbek’s
conclusion: government is necessary, but fails in its function if it is
not based on virtue in ruler and ruled.</p>
<p>The religious heresies in the Persian Letters were more startling
than the political. Rica observes that Negroes conceive God as black and
the Devil as white; he suggests (like Xenophanes) that if triangles
confabulated a theology, God would have three sides and sharp points.

<p>the power of another magician, called pope, who persuades people to
be- lieve that bread is not bread, and wine is not wine, “and a thousand
things of a like nature.” 62 He laughs at the conflict between Jesuits
and Jansenists. He is horrified by the Spanish and Portuguese
Inquisition, where “der - vishes 〔Dominican monks〕 cause men to be
burned as they would burn straw.” 63 He smiles at rosaries and
scapulars. He wonders how long the Catholic countries can survive in
competition with Protestant peoples, for he thinks that the prohibition
of divorce, and the celibacy of nuns and monks, will retard the growth
of population in France, Italy and Spain ( cf . twentieth-century
Ireland); at this rate, Usbek calculates, Catholicism in Europe cannot
last five hundred years more. 64 * Moreover, these idle and supposedly
contine nt monks “hold in their hands almost all the wealth of the
state. They are a miserly crew, always getting and never giving; they
are continually hoarding their income to acquire capital. All this
wealth falls as it were into a palsy; it is not circulated; it is not
employed in trade, industry, or manufactures.” 66 Usbek is troubled by
the thought that Eu - rope’s benighted infidels, who worship Christ
instead of Allah and Mo - hammed, seem all destined to hell, but he has
some hope that ultimately they will accept Islam and be saved. 67</p>
<p>Usbek, in a transparent parable, considers the Revocation (1685) of
Henry IV’s tolerant Edict of Nantes:</p>
<p>You know, Mirza, that some ministers of Shah Suleiman 〔Louis</p>
<p>XIV〕 formed the design of obliging all the Armenians of Persia
〔the</p>
<p>Huguenots〕 to quit the kingdom or become Mohammedans 〔Catho- lics〕
, in the belief that our empire will continue polluted as long as it
retains within its bosom these infidels. . . . The persecution of
the</p>
<p>Ghebers by our zealous Mohammedans has obliged them to fly in</p>
<p>crowds into the Indies, and has deprived Persia of that people which
labored so heartily. . . . Only one thing remained for bigotry to
do,</p>
<p>and that was to destroy industry, with the result that the Empire</p>

<li>France in 1713〕 fell of itself, carrying along with it that very
religion which they wished to advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If unbiased discussion were possible, I am not sure, Mirza, that
it</p>
<p>would not be a good thing for a state to have several religions. . .
.</p>
<p>History is full of religious wars; but … it is not the multiplicity
of</p>
<p>religions which has produced wars; it is the intolerant spirit
animating that one which believed itself in the ascendant. 68</p>
<p>The ideas of the Persian Letters seem trite to us now, but when they
were expressed they were for the author a matter of life and death, at
least</p>

<li>Montesquieu thought, in 1721, that the population of Europe was

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>

<p>Xof imprisonment or banishment; they are trite now because the fight
for freedom to express ideas was won. Because the Lettres persanes
opened a way, Voltaire was able, thirteen years later, to issue his
Lettres sur les Anglais, putting an English torch to French debris;
these two books an- nounced the Enlightenment. Montesquieu and his
liberty survived his book because he was a noble and the Regent was
tolerant. Even so he did not dare acknowledge his authorship, for there
were some disapproving voices amid the general acclaim. D’Argenson, who
himself would later criticize the government, thought “these are
reflections of a kind which a witty man can easily make, but which a
prudent man ought never allow to be printed.” And the cautious Marivaux
added: “A man must be sparing of his wit on such subjects.” Montesquieu
recalled: “When I had in some degree gained the esteem of the public,
that of the official classes was lost, and I met with a thousand
slights.” 69</p>
<p>Nevertheless he came to Paris to sip his fame in society and the
salons. Mme. de Tencin, the Marquise de Lambert and the Marquise du
Deffand all opened their hearths. Having left his wife behind at La
Brede, he had no difficulty falling in love with the ladies of Paris. He
aimed high — at Marie Anne de Bourbon, sister of the Due de Bourbon who
became prime minister in 1723. For her, we are told, he composed a
little prose poem, Le Temple de Gnide (1725), ecstatic with love. He
anointed its wanton- ness by pretending that it was a translation from
the Greek, and so ob- tained royal permission to print it. He pulled
wires — especially those of Mme. de Prie — to secure admission to the
Academy; the King objected that he was not a resident of Paris; he
hurried to Bordeaux, resigned his presidency of its Parlement (1726),
returned to Paris, and joined the Forty Immortals in 1728.</p>
<p>In April he set out on a tour that took three years and covered parts
of Italy, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, the Rhineland, Holland, and
Eng- land. He remained in England eighteen months (November, 1729, to
August, 1731). There he formed a friendship with Chesterfield and other
notables, was elected to the Royal Society of London and initiated into
Freemasonry, was received by George II and Queen Caroline, attended
Parliament, and fell in love with what he thought was the British
constitu- tion. Like Voltaire he went back to France strong in the
admiration for liberty, yet sobered by contact with the problems of
government. He re- tired to La Brede, transformed his park into an
English garden, and, ex- cept for occasional trips to Paris, gave
himself up to the researches and writings that occupied the rest of his
life.</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>THE PLAY OF THE MIND</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>2 . Why Rome Fell</p>
<p>In 1734 he issued, unsigned but acknowledged, Considerations sur les
causes de la grandeur des Romains et de leur decadence. He had submitted
the manuscript to a Jesuit scholar, and had consented to eliminate
passages that might give umbrage to the Church. The book did not and
could not repeat the success of the Lettres persanes; it contained no
indecencies, it dealt with a remote and complex subject, it was
relatively conservative in politics and theology. Radicals did not
relish the emphasis on moral decay as a cause of national decline, and
they were not ready to appreciate the terse wisdom of such sentences as:
“Those who have ceased to fear power can still respect authority.” 70
Today the little treatise is looked upon as a pioneer attempt at a
philosophy of history, and as a classic of French prose, recalling
Bossuet but adding brilliance to gravity.</p>
<p>The subject invited the historian-philosopher, for it involved the
whole gamut of a great civilization from birth to death, and exposed in
broad scope and illuminating detail one of the basic processes of
history — the dis- solution that seems fated to follow any full
evolution in individuals, reli- gions, and states. Already there was a
suspicion that France, after the col- lapse of le grand siecle, had
entered upon a long period of decay in empire, morals, literature, and
art; the profane trinity of Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau had not yet
appeared to challenge the intellectual supremacy of the seventeenth
century. But the rising courage of the new age showed in the fact that
Montesquieu, in explaining the course of history, considered only
earthly causes, and quietly set aside, except for incidental obeisance,
the Providence which, in Bossuet’s Discours sur Fhistoire universelle
(1681), had guided all events to divinely determined results.
Montesquieu proposed to seek laws in history as Newton had sought them
in space:</p>
<p>It is not Fortune who governs the world, as we see from the
history</p>
<p>of the Romans. . . . There are general causes, moral or physical,</p>
<p>which operate in every monarchy, raise it, maintain it, or overthrow
it.</p>
<p>All that occurs is subject to these causes; and if a particular
cause, like the accidental result of a battle, has ruined a state, there
was a general cause which made the downfall of this state ensue from a
single battle.</p>
<p>In a word, the principal movement 〔Failure principale 〕 draws with
it all the particular occurrences . 71</p>
<p>Consequently Montesquieu reduced the role of the individual in
history. The indi vidual, however great his genius, is but an instrument
of the “gen - eral movement”; his importance is due not to his
surpassing ability so much as to his falling in with what Hegel was to
call the Zeitgeist , or spirit of the</p>
<p>346</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xtime. “If Caesar and Pompey had thought like Cato 〔had striven to
preserve the powers of the Roman Senate〕, others would have come to the
same ideas 〔to subordinate the Senate〕 as those of Caesar and Pompey,
and the Republic, destined to perish 〔from internal causes〕 would have
been led to ruin by some other hand .” 72</p>
<p>But this “destiny” was no mystical guidance or metaphysical force; it
was a complex of factors producing the “principal movement”; and the
main func tion of the philosophical historian, in Montesquieu’s view, is
to ferret out each such factor, analyze it, and show its operation and
relations. So the decline of Rome (he thought) was due first of all to a
change from a republic — in which there had been a division and balance
of powers — to an empire better fitted to govern dependencies, but so
centering all rule in one city and one man as to destroy the liberty and
vigor of the citizens and the provinces. To this prime cause were added
other factors in the course of time: the spread of supine servility
among the masses; the desire of the poor to be supported by the state;
the weakening of character by wealth, luxury, and license; the influx of
aliens unformed by Roman traditions and ready to sell their votes to the
highest bidder; the corruption of central and provincial administrators;
the depreciation of currency; the excess of tax- ation; the abandonment
of farms; the sapping of martial virility by new religions and a long
peace; the failure of military discipline; the ascendancy of the army
over the civilian government; the preference of the army for making or
unmaking emperors in Rome rather than for defending the fron- tiers from
barbarian invasion . . . Perhaps in reaction against the super- natural
emphasis in Bossuet, Montesquieu made little account of those changes in
religion which Gibbon was to stress as a main cause of the im- perial
collapse.</p>
<p>But always Montesquieu came back to what he considered the prime fact
or in Rome’s decadence— the passage from republic to monarchy. By their
republican maxims the Romans conquered a hundred peoples; but by the
time they had accomplished this the republic could not subsist; and the
maxims of the new government, contrary to those of the republic, caused
the decline . 73 However, when we go back to Chapter vi, and examine the
maximes, or methods, by which the Roman Republic conquered “all the
peoples,” we find a strange assortment: deceit, broken treaties, force,
severe punishments, division of the enemy for piecemeal conquest (
divide et iw- pera ) , forcible reshuffling of populations, subverting
resistant governments by subsidizing internal revolts, and other
procedures familiar to states- men. “The Romans used thei r allies to
destroy an enemy, and then</p>
<p>soon destroyed the destroyers .” 74 Apparently forgetting this
description of republican maxims, or swallowing Machiavelli at one gulp,
