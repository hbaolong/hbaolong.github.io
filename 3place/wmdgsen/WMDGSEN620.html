<h4 id="chapter-xxv-iberia">CHAPTER XXV Iberia</h4>
<p>I. PORTUGAL: 1789-1808</p>
<p>N EWS of the French Revolution came to a Portugal that was struggling
to return to the quiet order of the Middle Ages after the violent and
scandalous attempt of the Marques de Pombal to bring it abreast, in
culture and law, with the France of Louis XV and the Spain of Charles
III. The Pyrenees obstructed the flow of ideas between France and the
Peninsula; the movement of ideas from Spain was hindered by Spain’s
recurrent eager - ness to swallow her sister state; and in both
countries the agents of the Inquisition loomed like lions at a palace
gate to repel any word or thought that might question the ancient
creed.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the social scale stood other guardians of the past:
the simple, mostly unlettered commoners — peasants, craftsmen,
tradesmen, sol- diers — who were fondly habituated to their transmitted
faith, comforted by its legends, awed by its miracles, thrilled by its
ritual. At the top were the feudal barons, models of manners and owners
of the soil; a timid, feeble- minded Queen Maria Francisca, and her son
John, regent (1799) and then (1816-26) king; all dependably protective
of the Church as the indispen- sable support of private morals, social
order, and absolute, divine-right monarchy.</p>
<p>Amid these diverse sentinels lurked a small minority — students,
Free- masons, scientists, poets, businessmen, a few officials, even a
noble or two — who were irked by the despotism of the past, furtively
flirted with philos- ophy, and dreamed of representative government,
free trade, free assembly, free press, free thought, and a stimulating
participation in the international of the mind.</p>
<p>Upon that timid minority, those shocked commoners, those startled
dig- nitaries and Inquisitors, the news of the French Revolution,
however dulled by delay, came as an exhilarating or terrifying
revelation. Some reckless spirits openly rejoiced; Masonic lodges in
Portugal celebrated the event, the Portuguese ambassador in Paris, who
may have read Rousseau or heard Mirabeau, applauded the French National
Assembly; the Portuguese Min- ister for Foreign Affairs allowed the
official gazette to salute the fall of the Bastille; copies of the
Revolutionary Constitution of 1791 were sold by French booksellers in
Portugal. 1</p>
<p>But when Louis XVI was deposed by a Paris uprising (1792), Queen</p>
<p>Maria felt her throne tremble, and surrendered the government to her
son.</p>
<ul>
<li>This name was given by the ancient Greeks to the region along the
River Iberus (now Ebro) , and was subsequently extended to the whole
Spanish-Portuguese Peninsula.</li>
</ul>
<p>531</p>
<p>53 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>The future John VI turned with fury upon the liberals of Portugal,
and encouraged his intendant of police to arrest, or expel, or keep
under unre- mitting surveillance, every Freemason, every important
alien, every writer who advocated political reform. Francisco da Silva,
leader of the liberals, was imprisoned; liberal nobles were banished
from the court; Manuel du Bocage (1765-1805), leading Portuguese poet of
the age, who had written a powerful sonnet against despotism, was jailed
in 1797, and supported himself in prison by translating Ovid and Virgil.
2 In 1793, infuriated by the execution of Louis XVI, the Portuguese
government followed Spain in a holy war against France, and sent a
squadron to join the British fleet in the Mediterranean. Soon Spain
negotiated a separate peace (1795); Portugal asked for a like
accommodation, but France refused, alleging that Portugal was in effect
a colony and ally of England. The quarrel simmered till Napoleon, after
conquering half of Europe, reached out for the little state that was
refusing to join in his Continental Blockade of Britain.</p>
<p>Behind the military and political situation of Portugal lay the
precarious structure of its economic life. As with Spain, the nation’s
wealth depended upon the importation of precious metals from its
colonies; this gold and silver, rather than domestic products, went to
pay for imported articles, to gild the throne, enrich the rich, and
purchase luxuries and slaves. No middle class grew to develop natural
resources with progressive agriculture and technological industry. When
command of the seas passed to England, the supply of gold became subject
to evading the British Navy or making terms with the British government.
Spain chose to fight, and almost ex- hausted her resources to build a
navy excellent in everything but seamanship and morale. When that navy,
reluctantly merged with the French, was defeated at Trafalgar, Spain
became dependent upon France; and Portugal, to avoid absorption by
France and Spain, became dependent upon England. Enterprising Englishmen
filled important posts in Portugal, opened or man- aged factories there.
British goods dominated Portugal’s import trade, and Britons agreed to
drink port wine from Oporto (“the port”) in Portugal.</p>
<p>The situation irritated and tempted Napoleon. It defied his plan to
bring England to peace by excluding her products from Continental
markets; it gave him an excuse for conquering Portugal; a conquered
Portugal could share with France in imprisoning Spain within French
policy; and a subject Spain might provide another throne for another
Bonaparte. So, as we have seen, Napoleon persuaded the Spanish
government to join with France in invading Portugal; the Portuguese
royal family fled in an English vessel to Brazil; and on November 30,
1807, Junot led a French-Spanish army, al- most unresisted, into Lisbon.
Liberal leaders in Portugal flocked to the new government, hoping that
Napoleon would annex their country and give it representative
institutions. 3 Junot humored these men, secretly laughed at them,
announced (February 1, 1808) “that the House of Braganza has ceased to
reign,” and more and more behaved like a king.</p>

<li>SPAIN: 1808</li>
</ol>
<p>Spain was still in the Middle Ages, and preferred it so. It was a
God-</p>
<p>intoxicated country, crowding its somber cathedrals, making devout
pil- grimages to sacred shrines, multiplying monks, comforted with
indulgences and absolutions, fearing and revering the Inquisition,
kneeling as the conse- crated Host was borne in awesome processions
through the streets, cherish- ing above all else the faith that brought
God into every home, disciplined children, guarded virginity, and
offered Paradise at the end of the burden- some testing called life. A
generation later George Borrow found “the ignorance of the masses so
great,” at least in Leon, “that printed charms against Satan and his
host, and against every kind of misfortune, are pub- licly sold in the
shops, and are i n great demand.” 4 Napoleon, still a son of the
Enlightenment while signing concordats with the Church, concluded that
“the Spanish peasants have even less share in the civilization of Europe
than the Russians.” 5 But the Spanish peasant, as Byron testi fied,
could be as “proud as the noblest duke.” 6</p>
<p>Education was almost confined to the bourgeoisie and the nobility;
lit- eracy was a distinction; even the hidalgos seldom read a book. The
ruling class distrusted print; 7 and in any case widespread literacy was
not needed in the existing economy of Spain. Some commercial cities,
like Cadiz and Seville, were fairly prosperous, and Byron, in 1809,
thought Cadiz “the</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties the high spirit of the nation survived,
supported by traditions of Ferdinand and Isabella and Philip II, of
Velasquez and Murillo, by the spread and potential wealth of Spain’s
empire in the Amer - icas and the Far East. Spanish art enjoyed a repute
rivaling the Italian and the Dutch. Now the nation gathered its
treasures in painting and sculpture into the Museo del Prado, built at
Madrid (1785-1819) by Juan de Vil- lanueva and his successors and aides.
There, among its greatest glories, are the frightening masterpieces of
the supreme painter of that age, Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes
(1746-1828).* Vicente Lopez y Portana handed</p>
<p>See Rousseau and Revolution , 300-09. That volume, thinking itself
the last of its series, accompanied Goya and Goethe to their end,
whereas, of course, they belonged to, and enclosed, the age of Napoleon,
whom they both admired through his rise and fall.</p>

<p>him down to us in an uncompromising portrait fully in accord with the
powerful and somber spirit who showed war in all its gory savagery, and
who loved his country and scorned its king.</p>
<p>Spanish literature — till civil and foreign war consumed the nation —
flour- ished under the double impulse of Catholic scholarship and the
French Enlightenment. A Jesuit priest, Juan Francisco de Masdeu, issued,
in install- ments from 1783 to 1805, a learned Historia cntica de Espana
y de la cultura espanola, which achieved integral history by weaving
cultural history into the general record of a civilization. 11 Juan
Antonio Llorente, who had been general secretary of the Spanish
Inquisition from 1789 to 1801, received from Joseph Bonaparte (1809) a
commission to write a history of that in- stitution; he thought it safer
to do this in Paris, and in French (1817-18). The flowering of prose and
poetry that had adorned the age of Charles III had not quite faded at
his death: Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos (1744- 1 8 1 1 ) continued to be
the voice of liberalism in education and government; Leandro Fernandez
de Moratin (1760-1828) still dominated the stage with comedies that
earned him the title of the Spanish Moliere. During the War of
Liberation (1808-14) Manuel Jose Quintana and the priest Juan Nicasio
Gallego poured out passionate poetry to stimulate the revolt against the
French.</p>
<p>Till that struggle tore them apart, most of the leading writers had
been won to French ideas of intellectual and political liberty; they and
the Free- masons were afrancesa dos — Frenchified; they deplored the
monarchical emasculation of the provincial cortes that had once kept
Spain alive in all its parts; they hailed the French Revolution, and
welcomed Napoleon as challenging Spain to free itself from a feudal
aristocracy, a medieval Church, and an incompetent government. Let a
masterly Spanish historian sing a powerful dirge to a dying dynasty:</p>
<p>In 1808, when the Bourbon monarchy was working toward its own
destruc- tion, the political and social situation of Spain might have
been summed up as follows: An aristocracy, especially the courtiers,
which had lost respect for the kings; rotten politics, ruled by personal
animosities and reciprocal fears; absolute lack of patriotism among the
upper classes, who subordinated every- thing else to passions and greed;
the delirious hope of the masses, centered upon a Prince — Ferdinand —
who had already shown himself to be both false and vengeful; and finally
the profound influence, in intellectual circles, of the ideas of the
Encyclopedists and the French Revolution. 12</p>
<p>An earlier chapter has described, from Napoleon’s corner, the
collapse of the Spanish monarchy: Charles IV (r. 1788-1808) allowed his
wife Maria Luisa and her paramour Godoy to take the government out of
his hands; Prince Ferdinand, heir apparent, maneuvered his father into
abdicating; Godoyistas fought Fernandistas; Madrid and its environs were
in chaos. Napoleon saw in the confusion an opportunity to bring the
entire Penin- sula under French rule and security within the Continental
Blockade. He</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV )</p>
<p>IBERIA</p>
<p>535</p>
<p>sent Murat and a second French army into Spain, with instructions to
main- tain order. Murat entered Madrid (March 23, 1808), and suppressed
a popular insurrection on the historic Dos de Mayo — the Second of May.
Meanwhile Napoleon had invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand to meet him
in Bayonne, in France near the Spanish border. He frightened the Prince
into restoring the throne to his father, and then persuaded the father
to abdicate in favor of Napoleon’s appointee, provided Catholicism
should be recognized and protected as the national religion. Napoleon
bade his brother Joseph to come and be king of Spain. Joseph, unwilling,
came, and received from Napoleon a new constitution for Spain, granting
much of what the Spanish liberals had hoped for, but requiring them to
make their peace with a chastened Church. Joseph went sadly to his new
responsibili- ties, and Napoleon returned to Paris happy with his
absorption of Spain.</p>
<p>He had reckoned without the Spanish masses and Wellington.</p>

<li>ARTHUR WELLESLEY: 1769-1807</li>
</ol>
<p>He would not be Wellington till 1809; till 1798 he was Wesley, though
far removed from Methodism. He was born in Dublin, May i, 1769 (105 days
before Napoleon), being the fifth son of Garret Wesley, first Earl of
Mornington, the English proprietor of an estate north of the Irish
capital. He was sent to Eton at the age of twelve, but was called home
after “three</p>
<p>When he had won his spurs he was appointed — through family influence
or plain purchase — to be aide-de-camp to the Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, and to a seat in the Irish House of Commons as representative
of the bor- ough of Trim. In 1799 he was made lieutenant colonel and led
three regi- ments in the Duke of York’s invasion of Flanders. He came b
ack from that aborted venture so disgusted with war, mud, and titled
incompetence that he thought of abandoning the Army for civil life. He
preferred the violin to the barracks, suffered a succession of ailments,
and impressed his brother Morn- ington as so deficient in ability that
not much could be expected of him. 16 A portrait of him, aged
twenty-six, by John Hoppner made him look like a poet, as handsome as
Byron. Like Byron, he proposed to a noble lady, was rejected and sampled
surfaces incontinently. In 1796 he went to India as a colonel under his
brother Richard, who, now Marquess Wellesley, became</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>53 6</p>
<p>governor of Madras, then of Bengal, and added some Indian
principalities to the British Empire. Arthur Wellesley (as the future
Duke now spelled him- self) won some profitable victories in these
campaigns, and was knighted in</p>

</ol>
<p>He continued to rise from post to post, now not so much by purchase
as by earning a reputation for careful analysis and competent
performance. William Pitt, near death, marked him out as a man who
“states every diffi - culty before he undertakes any service, but none
after he undertakes it.” 17 In 1807 he became chief secretary for
Ireland in the ministry of the Duke of Portland; in 1808 he was made
lieutenant general; in July he was commis- sioned to lead 13,500 troops
and expel Junot and the French from Portugal.</p>
<p>On August 1 he landed his men at Mondego Bay, a hundred miles north
of Lisbon. There he received some 5,000 Portuguese allies, and a letter
from the War Ministry promising him another 15,000 men at an early date,
but adding that Sir Hew Dalrymple, aged fifty-eight, would accompany
these reinforcements and assume supreme command of the entire
expedition. Wellesley had already designed his campaign, and did not
enjoy subordina- tion. He decided not to wait for those 15,000 men, but
to march north with his 18,500, and seek a battle that would decide
Junot’s fate and his own. Junot, who had allowed his army to deteriorate
with all the pleasures of a capital, led his 13,000 men out to meet the
challenge, and suffered a costly defeat at Vimeiro, near Lisbon (August
21, 1808). Dalrymple arrived after the battle, took command, stopped
pursuit, and arranged with Junot the Convention of Gntra (September 3)
by which Junot surrendered all the towns and fortresses that the French
had occupied in Portugal, but obtained consent for the unhindered exit
of his surviving forces; the British agreed to provide shipping for
those who wished to return to France. Wellesley signed the document,
feeling that the liberation of Portugal by one battle justified some
British courtesies.</p>
<p>This was the convention that Wordsworth and Byron, agreeing now and
rarely afterward, denounced as an incredible stupidity; those released
Frenchmen, if able to walk, would soon be conscripted to fight Britain
or her allies again. Wellesley was summoned to London to face a court of
in- quiry. He was not entirely sorry to go; he did not relish the
prospect of serving under Dalrymple; and — incredible as it may seem —
he hated war. “Take my word for it,” he was to say after many victories,
“if you had seen but one day of war you would pray to Almighty God that
you might never again see an hour of it.” 18 He seems to have convinced
the court of inquiry that the Convention of Cintra, by dissuading
further resistance, had saved thousands of British and Allied lives.
Then he retired to Ireland, and waited for a better opportunity to serve
his country and his good name.</p>

<li>THE PENINSULAR WAR: III (1808-12)</li>
</ol>
<p>Joseph Bonaparte, king of Spain, was in multiple trouble. He labored
to win a wider acceptance than that given him by a sprinkling of
liberals. These favored confiscatory measures against the wealthy
Church, but Joseph, al- ready hampered by his reputation as an agnostic,
knew that every move against the clergy would further inflame resistance
to his alien rule. The Spanish armies that Napoleon had defeated had
re-formed in scattered divi- sions, undisciplined but enthusiastic; the
guerrilla war of the peasantry against the usurpers went on between
sowing and reaping annually; the French army in Spain had to divide
itself into separate forces under jealous generals in a chaos of
campaigns that defied the efforts of Napoleon to co- ordinate them from
Paris. Napoleon learned, said Karl Marx, that “if the Spanish State was
dead, Spanish society was full of life, and every part of it was
overflowing with power of resistance…. The center of Spanish re-
sistance was nowhere and everywhere.” 19 After the collapse of a
major</p>
<p>Sir John Moore, before his death at Corunna (January 16, 1809), had
advised the British government to make no further attempt to control
Portu- gal. The French, he thought, would sooner or later carry out
Napoleon’s order to make Portugal a vassal of France; and how was
England to find transport, and provision enough soldiers to face the
100,000 seasoned French troops then in Spain? But Sir Arthur Wellesley,
restless in Ireland, told the War Ministry that if it would give him
undivided command of twenty to thirty thousand British troops, and
native reinforcements, he would under- take to hold Portugal against any
French army not exceeding 100,000 men. 21 His government took him at his
word, and on April 22, 1809, he reached Lisbon with 25,000 Briti shers,
whom he was later to describe as “the scum of the earth,… a pack of
rascals,… a crowd who only enlist for drink, and can only be managed
with the whip”; 22 but they could fight lustily when faced with a choice
of killing or being killed.</p>
<p>Anticipating their arrival, Marshal Soult had marched 23,000
Frenchmen</p>
<p>53 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>— doubtless themselves poor devils more familiar with taverns than
salons — down the coast to Oporto; while from the west another French
army, under Marshal Claude Victor, was advancing along the Tagus.
Wellesley, who had carefully studied Napoleon’s campaigns, resolved to
attack Soult before the two marshals could join their forces in an
attack on British-held Lisbon. Having added to his 25,000 men some
15,000 Portuguese under William Carr Beresford (Viscount Beresford to
be), he led them to a point on the River Douro opposite Oporto. On May
12, 1809, he crossed the stream, and attacked Soult’s unsuspecting army
in the rear in a battle that drove the French into a disorderly retreat,
having lost 6,000 men and all their artillery. Wellesley did not pursue
them, for he had to hurry south to halt Victor; but Victor, informed of
Soult’s disaster, turned back to Talavera, where he received from Joseph
reinforcements that increased his army to 46,000 men. Against these
Wellesley had 23,000 Britons and 36,000 Spaniards. The hos- tile masses
met at Talavera on July 28, 1809; the Spanish troops soon had enough,
and fled from the field; nevertheless Wellesley drove off repeated
French attacks until Victor withdrew with a loss of 7,000 men and seven-
teen guns. The British had suffered 5,000 casualties, but held the
field. The British government credited Wellesley with his courageous
leadership, and made him Viscount Wellington.</p>
<p>Nevertheless his support in the War Ministry was weakening. The vic-
tory of Napoleon at Wagram (1809), and his marriage with the Austrian
Emperor’ s daughter (March, 1810), had ended the Austrian fealty to Eng-
land; Russia was still an ally of France; and an additional 138,000
French troops were now available for service in Spain. Marshal Andre
Massena, with 65,000 men, was planning to lead them out of Spain to the
definite con- quest of Portugal. The British government informed
Wellington that if the French again invaded Spain he would be excused if
he withdrew his army to England. 23</p>
<p>This was a cru cial moment in Wellington’s career. Withdrawal,
however permitted, would tarnish his record unless some major future
victory, not to be reckoned upon, could lend glamour even to his
defeats. He decided to risk his men, his career, and his life on one
more throw of the dice. Mean- while he had his men build, from the Tagus
through Torres Vedras to the sea, a line of fortifications twenty-five
miles north of his base at Lisbon. Massena began his campaign by
capturing the Spanish stronghold of Gu- dad Rodrigo, and then crossed
into Portugal with 60,000 men. Wellington, commanding 52,000 Allies
(i.e. British, Spanish, and Portuguese), met him at Bussaco (north of
Coimbra) on September 27, 1810. In the battle he lost 1,250 in dead and
wounded; Massena lost 4,600. Nevertheless Wellington, feeling that he
could not rely, like Massena, on reinforcements, retired to the Torres
Vedras fortifications, ordered a policy of “scorched earth” as his army
retreated, and waited for Massena’s army to grow hungry a nd dis-
appear. It did. On March 5, 1811, Massena led his starving men back to
Spain, and yielded his command to Auguste Marmont.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>IBERIA</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>After a winter of resting and training his men, Wellington took the
initi- ative, marched into Spain, and with 50,000 troops attacked
Marmont’s 48,000 near Salamanca on July 22, 1812. Here the wholesale
execution cost the French 14,000 casualties, the Allies 4,700; Marmont
gave way. On July 21 King Joseph, with 15,000 soldiers , had left Madrid
to go to Marmont’s aid; en route he learned of Marmont’s defeat. Not
daring to return to the capi - tal, he led his army to Valencia, to join
a larger French force there under Marshal Suchet. He was followed in
chaotic haste by his court and officials and some 10,000 afrancesados.
On August 12 Wellington entered Madrid, and was welcomed ecstatically by
a populace that had remained immune to French charm and Napoleon’s
constitution. “I am among a people mad with joy,” Wellington wrote to a
friend. “God send my good fortune may con - tinue, and that I may be the
instrument of securing their independence.” 24 God hesitated. Marmont
reorganized his army behind the fortifications of Burgos; Wellington
besieged him there; Joseph marched from Valencia with 90,000 men to face
the Allies, Wellington retreated (October 18, 1812) past Salamanca to
Ciudad Rodrigo, losing 6,000 men on the way. Joseph re- entered Madrid,
to the grim displeasure of the populace and the delight of the middle
class. Meanwhile Napoleon was shivering in Moscow, and Spain, like the
rest of Europe, awaited the result of his gamble for a continent.</p>
<p>V. RESULTS</p>
<p>Even at this resting point in the Peninsular War, some results had
taken form. Geographically, the largest result was that the South
American col- onies of Spain and Portugal had freed themselves from
their weakened motherland, and had begun their own lusty and unique
career. All Spain south of the Tagus had been cleared of French troops.
Militarily Wellington had proved that France could not take Portugal —
and probably could not hold Spain — without risking the loss of all her
conquests east of the Rhine. Socially, the popular resistance, however
chaotic, had achieved a victory for the peasantry and the Church.
Politically, the provincial juntas had won back some of their old power
of local rule; each had built its own army, minted its own coinage,
formed its own policy — even, in some cases, signing a separate peace
with Britain. And most significantly of all, the juntas had sent
delegates to a national Cortes, with instructions to formulate a new
con- stitution for a new Spain.</p>
<p>This supreme Cortes, fleeing from French armies, had met first on the
Isla de Leon in 1810; when the French withdrew, it moved to Cadiz; and
there, on March 19, 1812, it promulgated a proudly liberal constitution.
Since most of the delegates were good Catholics, Article XII declared
that “the religion of the Spanish nation is and shall per petually be
Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman, the only true religion. The nation
protects it by wise and just laws, and prohibits the exercise of any
other [religion] what- ever”; however, the constitution abolished the
Tribunal of the Inquisition,</p>
<p>540</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>and restricted the number of religious communities. In nearly all
other mat- ters the Cortes accepted the leadership of the 1 84 delegates
from the middle class. Most of these called themselves “Liberals”— the
first known use of the term as a political designation. Under their lead
the Constitution of 1812 rivaled the Constitution of 1791 in
revolutionary France.</p>
<p>It accepted the Spanish monarchy, and acknowledged the absent Ferdi-
nand VII as the rightful king; however, it placed the sovereignty not in
the king but in the nation acting through its elected delegates. The
king was to be a constitutional ruler, obeying the laws; and adding to
them, and making treaties, only in conjunction with the national Cortes,
which was to be a single chamber. A new Cortes was to be chosen every
second year, by the adult males of the nation, through three stages of
election: parochial, dis- trict, and provincial. Laws were to be made
uniform throughout Spain; all citizens were to be equal before the law;
and the judiciary was to be inde- pendent of both the Cortes and the
king. The constitution called for the abolition of torture, slavery,
feudal courts, and seignorial rights. The press was to be free, except
in matters of religion. Uncultivated communal lands were to be
distributed to the poor.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances — which included the religious traditions of
Spain — it was a brave and progressive constitution. Now, it seemed,
Spain would enter the nineteenth century.</p>
