<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>Cromwell</p>
<p>1649-60</p>
<p>I. THE SOCIALIST REVOLT</p>
<p>H AVING beheaded Charles I (January 30, 1649), the victorious</p>
<p>Puritans faced the problems of constructing a new government and
restoring the security of life and property in an England disordered by
seven years of civil war. The Rump Parliament — the fifty-six active
mem- bers that remained of the Long Parliament after “Pride’s Purge”
(1648) — proclaimed the supremacy and sufficiency of the Commons,
abolished the House of Lords (February 6, 1649) and the monarchy, and
nominated as its executive arm a Council of State composed of three
generals, three peers, three judges, and thirty members of the House,
all Independents — i.e., republican Puritans. On May 19 the Commons
officially established the English republic: “England shall hereafter be
governed as a Common- wealth, or Free State, by the supreme authority of
this nation, the repre- sentatives of the people in Parliament, and by
such as they shall appoint and constitute as ministers under them for
the good of the peo ple.” 1 The republic was not a democracy; the
Parliament claimed a democratic base, but the expulsion of Royalist
members during the war, and of Presbyterians in the Purge, had “winnowed
and sifted it,” said Cromwell, “and brought it to a handful.” 2 In its
origin the Parliament had been elected by property owners only; now
whole counties were without delegates in the Rump. Its power rested not
on the people but on the army. Only the army could protect it from the
royalist rebels in England, the Catholic rebels in Ireland, the
Presbyterian rebels in Scotland, and the radical rebels in the army
itself.</p>
<p>To meet the expenses of the government, and the arrears of pay due to
the army, the Rump levied taxes as lavishly as the late King. It
proposed to confiscate the property of all who had borne arms for
Charles, but in most cases it compromised by taking a fine equal to a
part — from one tenth to one half — of the capital value of the estate.
Many young nobles, facing impoverishment in England, migrated to America
and founded aristocratic families like the Washingtons, the Randolphs,
the Madisons, the Lees.* Some royalist leaders were executed, some were
imprisoned. Even</p>
<p>•The American Civil War renewed the English Civil War by pitting the
descendants of English aristocrats in the South against the descendants
of English Puritans in the North.</p>
<p>*83</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>so, the royalist movement remained troublesome, for royalist
sentiment predominated among the people. The execution of the King had
turned him from a tax collector into a martyr. Ten days after that
regicide a book appeared under the title of Eikon Basilike — i.e., a
royal portrait. It had been written by John Gauden, a Presbyterian
minister, but it purported to be the thoughts and feelings of Charles as
set down by his own hand shortly before his death. Some of it may have
been elaborated from notes left by the King. 3 In any case the picture
presented by it was that of a tender- hearted ruler who had actually
been defending England against the tyranny of a merciless oligarchy.
Within a year the book sold thirty-six editions; it was translated into
five languages, and not all the thunder of Milton’s Eikonoklastes (1649)
could cancel its effect. It shared in promoting a public reaction
against the new government, and encouraged the royalist agents who in
every county of England began at once to agitate for the restoration of
the Stuart dynasty. The Council of State met the movement with</p>
<p>widespread and efficient espionage, and the prompt arrest of leaders
who might have organized a revolt.</p>
<p>At the other extreme a minority of the populace and a large part of
the army demanded a more thorough, some a socialist, democracy. The sky
rained radical pamphlets; Colonel John Lilburne alone produced a
hundred; Milton, at this stage, was not a poet but a pamphleteer.
Lilburne attacked Cromwell as a tyrant, an apostate, a hypocrite. One
writer complained that “you shall scarce speak to Cromwell about any
thing but he will lay his hand on his breast, elevate his eyes, and call
God to record. He will weep, howl, and repent, even while he doth smite
you under the fifth rib.” 4 Another pamphleteer asked: “We wer e ruled
before by King, Lords, and Commons, now by a General, Court Martial, and
Commons; and we pray you, what is the difference?” 5 The new government
felt compelled to censure press and pulpit sternly. In April, 1649,
Lilburne and three others were arrested for issuing two pamphlets that
described England as in “new chains.” The army clamored for their
release, and their women threatened Cromwell’s life if any harm came to
the prisoners. From prison Lilburne sent to his printer a defiant
Impeachment of High Treason against Cromwell and Ireton. In October the
four writers were tried in a cause celebre that drew thousands of people
about the court. Lilburne challenged the judges, and appealed to a jury.
When all four were acquitted there went up from the crowd “such a loud
and unanimous shout as is believed was never heard in Guildhall, which
lasted for about half an hour without intermission, which made the
judges for fear turn pale.” 6 For two years Lilburne was the hero of the
army. In 1652 he was banished; he returned in 1653, was again arrested,
was again acquitted (August, 1653); he was kept in prison</p>
<p>nevertheless. In 1655 he was released; in 1657 he died, aged
forty-three.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>l8 5</p>
<p>Some “Levellers” went beyond Lilbume and democracy to call for a</p>
<p>more equal distribution of goods. Why, they asked, should there be
rich and poor? Why should some starve while the rich engrossed the land?
In April, 1649, a “prophet” named William Everar d led four men to
St.</p>
<p>George’s Hill in Surrey; they took possession of some unoccupied
land, dug the earth, planted seed, and invited recruits; some thirty
other</p>
<p>“Diggers,” as they came to be called, joined them, and (said a report
to the Council of St ate) “they threaten the neighbors that they will
shortly make them all come up to the hills and work.” 7 Haled before Sir
Thomas Fairfax, captain general of the army, Everard explained that his
followers proposed to respect private property, “only to me ddle with
what is common and untilled, and make it fruitful,” but they hoped “that
the time will suddenly be when all men shall willingly come in and give
up their lands and estates, and submit to this Community of Goods.” 8
Fairfax released the men as harmless fanatics. One of them, Gerrard
Winstanley, continued the movement with a manifesto (April 26, 1649)
entitled The True Leveller’s Standard Advanced: “In the beginning the
great Creator Reason made the earth a common treasury for beasts and
men” ; but then man, falling into blindness, became a greater slave to
his own kind than the beasts of the field to him; the earth was bought
and sold and hedged in by rulers, and was kept in the possession of a
few. All landlords are thieves. Only when common ownership is restored
will crime and hatred cease. 9 In The Law of Freedom (1652) Winstanley
begged the Commonwealth to establish a society in which there would be
no buying or selling, no lawyers, no rich or poor; all to be compelled
to work till forty, then to be absolved from toil; the franchise to be
open to all adult males; marriage to be a civil ceremony, and divorce to
be free. 10 The Diggers abandoned their scheme, but their propaganda
entered into the memory of the English poor, and perhaps crossed the
Channel to France and the sea to America.</p>
<p>Cromwell, himself a property owner and well versed in the nature of
man, put no trust in these ideals of common ownership, or even of adult
suffrage. In the confusion inevitable after the violent overthrow of a
government, some centralized authority was needed, and Cromwell supplied
it. Many who hated him as a regicide welcomed for a time a dictatorship
that seemed the sole alternative to social and political dissolution.
And even the army, when it heard that counterrevolution was brewing in
Ireland and Scotland, was glad that his iron hand was ready to lead it
against rebels who sought not a democratic utopia, but a restored and
vengeful monarchy.</p>
<p>1 86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE IRISH REVOLT</li>
</ol>
<p>In Ireland the reaction against the Great Rebellion united
transiently the Protestants of the Pale and the Catholics in it and
beyond. Even before the execution of Charles I James Butler, Earl of
Ormonde, as lord lieutenant in Ireland, signed a treaty with the
Confederate Catholics at Kilkenny (January 17, 1649), by which, in
return for religious freedom and an independent Irish Parliament, they
agreed to furnish him with fifteen thousand infantry and five hundred
horse. Ormonde sent a message to the Prince of Wales, whom he
immediately recognized as Charles II, inviting him to come to Ireland
and lead a combined army of Protestants and Catholics. Charles chose to
go to Scotland, but Cromwell decided to meet the Irish threat first.</p>
<p>When he landed at Dublin in August, Ormonde had already been de-
feated at Rathmines by troops adhering to the Commonwealth, and had
retreated with his remaining 2,300 men into the fortified town of
Drogheda on the Boyne. Cromwell besieged it with ten thousand soldiers,
took it by storm (September 10, 1649), and ordered all the surviving
garrison killed. 11 Some civilians were included in the massacre; every
priest in the town was slain; 12 altogether some 2,300 died in this
triumphant slaughter. Cromwell shared the credit with God: “I wish that
all honest hearts may give the</p>
<p>But the war continued for three years. From Drogheda Cromwell passed
to the siege of Wexford; it was soon taken; fifteen hundred of its
defenders and inhabitants were slain; “God, by an unexpected providence
in His righteous justice,” reported Cromwell, “brought a just judgment
upon them . . . with their bloods to answer the cruelties which they had
exercised upon the lives of divers poor Protestants.” 15 The policy of
massacre failed. The towns of Duncannon and Waterford defied Cromwell’s
siege; Kilk enny surrendered only after receiving terms that elsewhere
had been refused; Clonmel was taken, but after a loss of two thousand
men. Hearing that Charles II had reached Scotland, Cromwell left the
further prosecution of the Irish war to his son-in-law Henry Ireton, and
sailed to England (May 24, 1650).</p>
<p>Ireton was an able leader, but he died of plague on November 26,
1651. The policy of massacre was abandoned, pardon was offered to the
rebels, and by the Articles of Kilkenny (May 12, 1652) nearly all of
them sur-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>rendered on condition of being allowed to emigrate unhindered. An
“Act for the Settling of Ireland” (August 12) confiscated part or all of
the</p>
<p>property of Irishmen — of whatever faith — who could not prove that
they had been loyal to the Commonwealth; in this way 2,500,000 acres of
Irish soil were transferred to English or Irish soldiers or civilians
who had supported Cromwell in Ireland; two thirds of the soil of Ireland
passed into the hands of Englishmen. 16 The counties of Kildare, Dublin,
Carlow, Wicklow, and Wexford were formed into a new English Pale, and an
attempt was made to exclude from them all Irish proprietors, then all
Irishmen. Thousands of Irish families were dispossessed, and were given
until March 1, 1655, to find other homes. Hundreds were shipped to
Barbados or elsewhere on a charge of vagrancy.</p>
<p>Sir William Petty calculated that out of a total population of
1,466,000 in Ireland in 1641, 616,000 had perished by 1652, by war,
starvation or plague. In some counties, said an English officer, “a man
might travel twenty</p>
<p>miserable.” 17 The Catholic religion was outlawed; all Catholic
clergymen were ordered to leave Ireland within twenty days; to harbor a
priest was made punishable by death; severe penalties were decreed for
absence from Protestant services on Sunday; magistrates were authorized
to take away the children of Catholics and send them to England for
education in the Protestant faith. 18 All the inhumanity that was to be
visited by Catholics upon the Protestants of France in 1680-90 was
visited by Protestants upon the Catholics of Ireland in 1650-60.
Catholicism became an inseparable part of Irish patriotism because the
Church and the people were fused in a community of suffering. Those
bitter years remained in Irish memory as an undying heritage of
hate.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SCOTTISH REVOLT</li>
</ol>
<p>The Scots, who had surrendered Charles I to the English Parliament,
were shocked by his execution, suddenly remembering that his father was
a Scot. They looked upon Pride’s Purge of Presbyterians from the Long
Parliament as a violation of the Solemn League and Covenant by which
that Parliament had sworn fidelity to Scotland and the Presbyterian
faith; they feared that the victorious Puritans would attempt to force
their own form of Protestantism upon Scotland as well as England. On
February 5, 1649, less than a week after the beheading of Charles I, the
Scottish Parlia- ment or Estates proclaimed his son Charles II, then in
the Netherlands, to be the rightful King of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>Before they would allow his entry into Scotland they required him to
sign the National Covenant and the Solemn League and Covenant, and swear
to maintain or establish Presbyterian Protestantism in all his dominions
and in his household. Charles II, who was already a mixture of
Catholicism and skepticism, had no talent for Presbyterianism, but much
relish for a throne; he reluctantly signed all these demands at Breda on
May i, 1650. Montrose, noblest of the Scots in this age, led a small
force from the Orkneys into Scotland, hoping to raise for Charles an
army independent of the Covenanters; he was defeated, captured, and
hanged (May 21, 1650). On June 23 Charles landed in Scotland, eager to
head an army against the Puritan Commonwealth that had beheaded his
father. Before the Scots would fight for him they induced him to issue a
declaration in which he desired to be “deeply humbled before God because
of his father’s opposi - tion to the Solemn League and Covenant, and
because his mother had been guilty of idolatry” (Catholicism). 19 To
expiate the sins of Charles I and II the Scottish clergy ordained, for
the army and the people, a solemn fast, and assured the army that now —
the young King having made amends to Heaven — it would be invincible. 20
On the insistence of the ministers all officers who put loyalty to the
King above loyalty to the Covenant and the Kirk were purged from the
army; in this way eighty of its ablest leaders were discharged.</p>
<p>Cromwell proposed to the English Parliament that he invade Scotland
at once, without waiting for a Scottish attack. Fairfax, who had refused
to take part in the trial of Charles I, now resigned his supreme command
of the Commonwealth armies. Cromwell, appointed to succeed him,
organized his forces with his usual decision and speed, and crossed into
Scotland (July 22, 1650) at the head of sixteen thousand men. On August
3 he sent to the Commission of the General Assembly of the Scottish Kirk
a letter full of intestinal fortitude: “Is it infallibly agreeable to
the Word of God, all that you say? I beseech you, in the bowels of
Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.” 21 At Dunbar
(September 3) he routed the main Scottish armies, taking ten thousand
prisoners; soon he held Edinburgh and Leith. The Scottish preachers lost
face and infallibility; the purged officers were hastily recalled.
Charles II was formally crowned at Scone. Cromwell took sick in
Edinburgh, and for some months the conflict marked time.</p>
<p>Then the reorganized Scottish army, with Charles at its head, marched
into England, hoping that all good royalists and Presbyterians would
come to the banner of legitimacy and truth. Cromwell pursued them,
gathering local militia as he passed through the English towns. At
Worcester</p>
<p>(September 3, 1651) the battle was fought that preserved the Common-
wealth and made Charles again an exile; by superior strategy and
courage, Cromwell’s lesser forces defeated thirty thousand Scots.
Charles was brave,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>but he was no general. He strove to rally his disordered troops, but
they seemed awed and palsied by Cromwell’s reputation as a warrior who
never lost a battle; many of them threw down their arms and fled.
Charles begged his officers to shoot him; they refused, and a few of his
most devoted followers led him to temporary safety in a royalist home.
There he cut his hair close to his head, discolored his hands and face,
exchanged his clothes for those of a laborer, and began a long march, on
horse and foot, hunted from one hiding place to another, sleeping in
attics, barns, or woods, once in a “Royal Oak” tree in Boscobel while
Commonwealth soldiers searched for him below. Often recognized, never
betrayed, he and his party, after forty days of flight, found at
Shoreham, in Sussex, a vessel whose captain agreed, at the risk of his
life, to take them to France</p>
<p>(October 15).</p>
<p>Cromwell entrusted to General George Monck the further suppression of
the Scottish rebels; by February, 1652, this was complete. Scotland was
made subject to England, its separate Parliament was dissolved, but the
country was allowed to send thirty delegates to the London Parliament.
The Kirk was chastened by the prohibition of its general assemblies, and
by the toleration of all peaceful Protestant sects. Economically,
Scotland benefited from the new freedom of trade with England.
Politically it waited and prayed for a Stuart restoration.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>OLIVER ABSOLUTE</li>
</ol>
<p>Cromwell returned in modest triumph to London. Seeing the multitude
that had collected to witness his arrival, he remarked that a still
greater crowd would have gathered to see him hanged. 22 The Rump
Parliament gave him an annual allowance of four thousand pounds, and the
once royal palace at Hampton Court. It trusted that he would be content
to re- main its general. It proposed a new election to raise its
membership to four hundred, but the present members were to retain their
seats without re-election, and were to determine the conditions of the
franchise and the validity of the votes. It protected itself against
criticism by rigidly restricting the freedom of pulpit and press:
“Nothing by pretence of pulpit liberty shall be suffered in prejudice of
the peace and honour of the government.” 23 The clergy of the Anglican
Established Church were dispossessed of their livings. Persons who
professed the Catholic faith were condemned to forfeit two thirds of
their property. Rewards were offered for the apprehension of Catholic
priests. 24</p>
<p>Cromwell, though slow to make up his mind, was prompt to act when he
had reached a decision. He suffered impatiently the long debates
that</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>in Parliament confused policy and obstructed administration; he
agreed with Charles I that the executive power should be distinct and
free from the legislative. He began to wonder might it not be a blessing
if Cromwell were king. He hinted the idea (December, 1652) to his friend
Whitelocke, who lost his friendship by objecting. 25 On the morning of
April 20, 1653, hear- ing that the Rump was about to make itself the
unelected master of the new Parliament, he gathered a handful of
soldiers, stationed them at the door of the House, entered it with Major
General Thomas Harrison at his side, and for a time listened in dark
silence to the discussion. When the question was put to the vote he rose
and spoke, at first with moderation, soon with fury. He denounced the
Rump as a self-perpetuating oligarchy unfit to govern England.
“Drunkards!” he cried, indicating one member. “Whore - master!” he
shouted at another. “You are no Parliament. I say you are no i
Parliament. I will put an end to your sittings.” Turning to Harrison, he
ordered, “Call them in, call them in.” His soldiery marched into the</p>
<p>I chamber; Cromwell commanded them to clear the room; the members ;
left, protesting, “This is not honest”; the empty hall was locked, and
next day a notice was found tacked to the door: “This house to l ett,
now unfurnished.” 26 Going to the room where the Council of State was in
session, Cromwell, accompanied by two generals, told it, “If you are met
here as private persons, you shall not be disturbed; but if as a Council
of State, this is no place for you. . . . Take notice that the
Parliament is</p>
<p>dissolved.” 27 So ignominiously ended the Long Parliament, which had
sat at Westminster, in full or in Rump, since 1640, and had transformed
the constitution and government of England. Now there was no
constitution, only an army and an untitled king.</p>
<p>Generally the people were glad to have done with a Parliament that
had shaken England to the verge of anarchy. According to Cromwell, there
was “not so much as the barking of a dog, or any . . . visible repining
at its dissolution.” 28 Ardent Puritans accepted the expulsion as
clearing the way for the Fifth Monarchy — i.e., the promised coming and
rule of Christ. Royalists took heart, and whispered that Cromwell would
now call back Charles II and content himself with a dukedom, or the
viceroyalty of Ireland. But Oliver was not the man to sit content under
another’s will. He instructed his military aides to choose — chiefly
from the Puritan con- gregations of England — 140 men, including five
from Scotland and six from Ireland, to meet as a “Nominated Parliament.”
When it assembled at Whitehall on July 4, 1653, Cromwell confessed that
it had been chosen by the army, but he hailed it as beginning a
veritable reign of saints under the presidency of Jesus Christ, 29 and
proposed to devolve upon it the supreme authority and the task of
devising a new constitution. For five months it struggled with this
assignment, but it lost itself in long debates,</p>

<p>and divided hopelessly on questions of religion and toleration.
London wits called it “Barebone’s Parliament,” from one of its members,
Praise - God Barebon, a Fifth Monarchy saint.</p>
<p>The army tired of these men as it had tired of those it had expelled
in April. The officers, playing Antony, proposed to Cromwell that he</p>
<p>make himself king; Caesar gently demurred, but on December 12 eighty
members of the Parliament, at the pointed suggestion of the army, an-
nounced to Cromwell that the new assembly could come to no agreement,
and was voting its own dissolution. An “Instrument of Government”</p>
<p>prepared by army leaders proposed that Cromwell be “Lord
Protector</p>
<p>Was he a despot? Obviously he relished power, but this is a common
taste, and most natural to conscious ability. He had thought of making
himself king, and of establishing a new royal line. 31 He seems to have
been sincere in offering to surrender his power to the Nominated Parlia-
ment, but its incompetence convinced him that his own executive
authority was the sole present alternative to chaos; if he stepped down
there seemed no one who could command sufficient support to maintain
order. The radicals in the army condemned the Protectorate as just
another monarchy; they denounced Cromwell as “a dissembling perjured
villain,” and threat - ened him with “a worse fate than had befallen the
last tyrant.” 32 Some of these rebels he sent to the Tower, including
the Major General Har- rison who had led the soldiers in expelling the
Rump. Cromwell’s fear for his own safety led him more and more toward
absolutism, for he knew that half the nation would have welcomed his
assassination. Like other rulers, he felt the need to surround himself
with awe-inspiring splendor and dignity; he moved into Whitehall Palace
(1654), refurnished it sumptu- ously, and adopted royal state; 33 but
doubtless much of this show was to impress ambassadors and awe the
populace.</p>
<p>Privately he was a man without airs, living simply and devotedly with
his mother, wife, and children. His mother loved him fearfully,
trembling for his life at every musket shot; dying at ninety-three
(1654), she said, “My dear son, I leave my heart with thee.” 34 He
himself, in his middle fifties, was aging rapidly; crisis after crisis
had shaken his supposedly iron nerves; the campaigns in Ireland and
Scotland had added fever to his</p>
<p>I 9 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>gout; and every day was passed in trouble and anxiety. Lely painted a
remarkable portrait of him in 1650. Everyone knows Cromwell’s admo -
nition to the painter: “Mr. Lely, I desire you would use all your skill
to paint my picture truly like me, and not flatter me at all; but remark
all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything; otherwise I never
will pay a farthing for it.” 35 Lel y took his fee in his hands and
polished the Protector considerably; nevertheless he caught well the
stern strong face, incarnate will — and also a nervous spirit strained
to the breaking point.</p>
<p>Cromwell was criticized for the somber simplicity of his usual dress
— a plain black coat and suit; but on official occasions he donned a
coat em- broidered with gold. In public he maintained an unostentatious
dignity; privately he indulged in amusements and jesting, even in
practical jokes and occasional buffoonery. 36 He loved music, and played
the organ well. 37 His religious piety was apparently sincere, 38 but he
took the name of the Lord (not in vain) so often in support for his
purposes that many accused him of hypocrisy. Probably there was some
hypocrisy in his public piety, little in the private piety that all who
knew him attested. His letters and speeches are half sermons; and there
is no question that he assumed too readily that God was his right hand.
His private morals were impeccable, his public morals were no better
than those of other rulers; he used de- ception or force when he thought
them necessary to his major purposes. No one has yet reconciled
Christianity with government.</p>
<p>He was not technically absolute. Pursuant to the Instrument of Gov-
ernment, a Council of State was formed and a Parliament was elected.
Despite all efforts of the Protector and the army to ensure the return
of complaisant delegates, the Commons that convened on September 3,
1654, contained some troublesome republicans, even some royalists. A
struggle ensued as to whether the Parliament or the Protector should
control the army. Parliament proposed to reduce the number and pay of
the soldiers; they rebelled, and persuaded Cromwell to dismiss the
Parliament (January 22, 1655). Actually the government of England had
been a military dic- tatorship since Pride had purged the Parliament in
1648.</p>
<p>Cromwell was now driven to govern without pretense of any other</p>
<p>than martial law. In the summer of 1655 he divided England into
twelve military districts, and over each district he stationed a corps
of soldiers headed by a major general. To support the expense of this
establishment he laid a tax of ten per cent upon all Royalist estates.
The people pro- tested, criticism and rebellion spread, voices were
heard calling for the restoration of Charles II. Cromwell replied with
stricter censorship, wider espionage, arbitrary arrests, and
star-chamber proceedings that bypassed juries and habeas corpus. 39 “Sir
Harry” Vane was among the former revolu - tionists who found their way
to jail. Revolutions eat their fathers.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>Needing more money than he dared raise by further direct taxes, Crom-
well summoned another Parliament. When it assembled (September 17,</p>
<p>1656), his Council of State posted army officers at the door of the
House, and forbade entry to 1 03 members duly elected but suspected of
republican, royalist, Presbyterian, or Catholic sympathies. The excluded
members signed a remonstrance denouncing the exclusion as a flagrant
violation of their constituents’ expressed will, and they branded as
rank hypocrisy “the practice of the tyrant to use the name of God and
religion, and formal fasts and prayer, to color the blackness of the
fact.” 40 Of the 352 members who passed the Council’s scrutiny, 175 were
army men, or appointees or relatives of Cromwell. The reduced and
submissive Parliament presented to the Protector (March 31, 1657) “An
Humble Petition and Advice”</p>
<p>asking him to take the title of king. Sensing opposition to this in
the army, Cromwell refused, but a compromise gave him the right to name
his suc- cessor as lord protector. In January, 1658, he consented to
readmit the excluded members to the House; at the same time he chose
nine peers and sixty-one commoners to sit as a Second House. Many army
officers re- fused to support this move. When they entered into an
agreement with the republicans in the Commons to limit the powers of the
Second House, Cromwell lost his temper, invaded Westminster Palace, and
dismissed the Parliament (February 4, 1658). Now in law, as well as in
fact, the English republic ended, and monarchy was restored. History had
given another illustration to Plato’s sardonic sequence of monarchy,
aristocracy, democ - racy, dictatorship, and monarchy. 41</p>
<p>V. PURITAN HEYDAY</p>
<p>The Puritan victory involved a religious revolution. The Church
of</p>
<p>England had been broken up in 1643 by the abolition of the
episcopacy. The Presbyterian form of Protestantism — in which the
congregations were ruled by ministers governed by district synods
subject to a general as- sembly — had been made the official religion of
the state in 1646, but this Presbyterian dominance ended two years later
when Pride purged the Presbyterians from Parliament. For a time it
seemed that religion was to be left free of state control or subsidy.
But Cromwell (who came to agree in almost everything with the King whom
he had killed) believed that a state-endowed church was indispensable to
education and morals. In 1654 he appointed a “Commission of Triers” to
test clergymen for fitness to receive a benefice and stipend. Only
Independents (Puritans), Baptists, and Presbyterians were eligible. Each
parish was allowed to choose be- tween the presbyterian form of
organization and the congregational form</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>— in which each congregation ruled itself. The Puritans adopted the
con- gregational form; the presbyterian system, which prevailed in
Scotland, was largely confined in England to London and Lancashire. The
Anglican clergy, once so powerful, were ejected from their livings, and
ministered to their followers in secret places, like the Catholic
priests. In 1657 John Evelyn was arrested for attending Anglican
services. 42 Catholicism was still outlawed. Two priests we re hanged
(1650, 1654) for “seducing the people,” and in 1657 the Puritan
Parliament, with Cromwell’s consent, passed an act by which any person
over sixteen years old who did not disavow Catholicism was to suffer the
forfeiture of two thirds of his</p>
<p>property. 43 By 1650 religion had taken on a measure of social
stratifica- tion: the poor favored the dissenting sects — Baptists,
Quakers, Fifth Monarchy Men, etc. — or the Catholics; the middle classes
were predomi- nantly Puritans; the aristocracy and most of the gentry
(untitled land- owners) adhered to the disestablished Anglican
Church.</p>
<p>Intolerance was inverted rather than lessened. Instead of
Anglicans</p>
<p>persecuting Catholics, Dissenters, and Puritans, the triumphant
Puritans, who formerly had clamored for toleration, now persecuted
Catholics, Dissenters, and Anglicans. They forbade the use of the Book
of Common Prayer, even in the privacy of homes. The Puritan Parliaments
limited toleration to those Britons who accepted the Trinity, the
Reformation, the Bible as God’s Word, and the rejection of bishops.
Socinians or Unitarians were therefore beyond toleration. Severe
penalties were decreed for any criticism of the Calvinistic creed or
ritual. 44 Cromwell was more lenient than his Parliaments. He connived
at some Anglican services, and per- mitted a small number of Jews to
live in London, even to build a synagogue. Two Anabaptist preachers
denounced him as the Beast of the Apocalypse, but he bore with them
patiently. 45 He used his influence to check the persecution of
Huguenots in France and of Waldenses in Piedmont; but when Mazarin asked
in return more toleration of Catholics in England, Cromwell pleaded his
inability to control the zeal of the Puritans. 40 Perhaps only among the
Jews did religion play so pervasive a role in everyday life as among the
Puritans; and indeed Puritanism agreed with Judaism in almost everything
except the divinity of Christ. Literacy was encouraged in order that the
Bible might be read by all. The Old Testa- ment was loved with a special
devotion, because it offered the model of a society dominated by
religion. The main business of life was to escape the fires of hell; the
Devil was real and everywhere, and only the grace of God could enable a
chosen few to inherit salvation. Biblical phrases and imagery permeated
the utterances of the Puritans; thoughts and visions of God or Christ
(but never of Mary) brightened and terrified their minds. Their clothing
was modest, somber, and unadorned; their speech was grave and</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>slow. They were expected to abstain from all profane amusements and
sensual pleasure. The theaters, which had been closed in 1642 because of
war, remained closed till 1656 because of Puritan condemnation. Horse
races, cockfights, wrestling matches, bear or bull baiting, were
forbidden; and to make sure that the bears in London would be baited no
more the Puritan Colonel Newson killed them all. 47 All maypoles were
pulled down. Beauty was suspect. Women were respected as faithful wives
and good mothers; elsewise they were in bad odor with the Puritans as
temptresses, and as the cause of man’s expulsion f rom Paradise. Music
was frowned upon, except in hymns. Art was destroyed in the churches,
and none was produced except for some excellent portraits by Samuel
Cooper and by Peter Lely — who was a Dutchman.</p>
<p>The Puritan attempt to legislate morality was probably the most</p>
<p>thoroughgoing since the Mosaic Law. Civil marriage was recognized as
valid and divorce was allowed, but adultery was made a capital crime;
however, after two executions on this head no jury would convict. Oaths
were punished on a class-graduated scale; they cost a duke twice as much
as a baron, three times as much as a squire, ten times as much as a
commoner; one man was fined for saying “God is my witness.” 48 Wednesday
was a day of obligatory fasting from meat, even if it coincided with
Christmas, and soldiers were authorized to invade homes to see that the
fasts were ob- served. No shops were to be opened on Sunday, no games or
sports were then to be played, no worldly work was to be done, and no
avoidable travel was permitted ; “vainly and profanely walking on the
day” was prohibited. 49 Despite the Restoration and its moral relapse,
the English Sunday remained “blue” till our time.</p>
<p>Many of these legal or social taboos proved too severe for human
nature. We are told that a large proportion of the population under
Cromwell be- came hypocrites, sinning as usual, pursuing money, women,
and power, but always with a long face, a nasal twang, and religious
phrases dripping from the tongue. And yet a great number of Puritans
seem to have lived up to their Gospel with sincerity and courage. We
shall find two thousand Puritan preachers accepting poverty under the
Restoration rather than abandon their principles. The Puritan regimen
narrowed the mind but stengthened the will and the character. It helped
to prepare Englishmen for self-rule. If the home was darkened by fear of
hell and by Puritan ordinances, the family life of the common people was
given an order and purity that survived the demoralization of the elite
in the reign of Charles II. All in all, the Puritan regime probably
effected a moral betterment which — renewed and reinforced by Methodism
in the eighteenth century — may deserve much of the credit for the
comparatively high morality of the British nation today.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE QUAKERS</li>
</ol>
<p>All the virtues of the Puritans shone in their offshoot the Quakers,
how- ever obscured for a time with fantasies and bigotry. The fear of
both God and Satan was so strong in them that sometimes it set their
bodies trembling, and gave them a name. Said one of them, Robert
Barclay, in 1679:</p>
<p>The power of God will break forth into a whole meeting, and there</p>
<p>will be such an inward travail, while each is seeking to overcome the
evil in themselves, that by the strong workings of these opposite</p>
<p>powers, like the going of two opposite tides, every individual will
be strongly exercised as in a day of battle, and thereby trembling
and</p>
<p>a motion of the body will be upon most, if not upon all, which,
as</p>
<p>the Power of Truth prevails, will from pangs and groans end with
a</p>
<p>sweet sound of thanksgiving and praise. And from this the name of</p>
<p>Quakers, i.e., Tremblers, was first reproachably passed upon us.
B0</p>
<p>The explanation of their founder, George Fox, is slightly different:
“Justice Bennet of Derby was the first that called us Quakers, because
we bid them tremble at the word of the L ord. This was in 1650.” 51
Their own name for their sect was the Friends of Truth, and later, more
modestly, the Society of Friends.</p>
<p>Apparently they were at first Puritans with an especially strong con-
viction that their hesitations between virtue and sin were the
struggles, in their minds and bodies, of two spiritual forces, one good
and the other evil, to possess them here and through all eternity. They
accepted the basic tenets of the Puritans — the divine inspiration of
the Scriptures, the fall of Adam and Eve, the natural sinfulness of man,
the redeeming death of Christ the Son of God, and the possibility of the
Holy Ghost or Spirit coming from heaven to enlighten and ennoble the
individual soul. To perceive and feel this Inner Light, to welcome its
guidance, was to the Quaker the essence of religion; if a man followed
that Light he needed no preacher or priest, and no church. That Light
was superior to human reason, even to the Holy Bible itself, for it was
the direct voice of God to the soul.</p>
<p>George Fox was a man with little education, but the Journal that
he</p>
<p>wrote is an English classic, revealing the literary power of
unliterary speech if simple, earnest, and sincere. Son of a weaver,
apprenticed to a shoemak er, (le left his master and his relatives “at
the command of God,” and began at the age of twenty-three (1647) the
perambulant preaching that ended only with his death in 1691. In those
early years he was beset with temptations, and went to clergymen for
counsel. One prescribed</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>medicine and bloodletting, another recommended tobacco and psalms. 52
George lost faith in ministers, but whenever he opened the Scriptures he
found solace.</p>
<p>Often I took my Bible, arid went and sate in hollow trees and
lone-</p>
<p>some places till night came on; and frequently in the night
walked</p>
<p>mournfully about by myself, for I was a man of sorrows in the times
of the first workings of the Lord in me. . . . Then the Lord led me</p>
<p>along, and let me see His love, which was endless and eternal,
surpass- ing all the knowledge that men have in the natural state, and
can get by history or books. 53</p>
<p>Soon he felt that the divine love had chosen him to preach the Inner
Light to all. At a meeting of Baptists in Leicestershire “the Lord
opened my mouth, and the everlasting truth was declared amongst them,
and the power of the Lord was over them all.” 54 A report spread that he
had “a discerning spirit,” whereupon many came to hear him. “The Lord’s
power broke forth, and I had great openings 〔revelations〕 and
prophecies.” 55 “As I was walking in the fields, the Lord said unto me:
‘Thy name is written in the Lamb’s book of life, which was before the
foundation of the world’” 56 — i.e., George was now comforted with the
thought that he was among that minority of men chosen by God, before the
Creation, to receive His grace and eternal bliss. Now he felt equal to
any man, and the pride of this divine election forbad e him “to put off
my hat to any, high or low; and I was required to Thee and Thou all men
and women, without respect to rich or poor, great or small.” 57</p>
<p>Convinced that true religion was found not in churches but only in
the enlightened heart, he entered a church near Nottingham, and
interrupted the sermon by crying out that the test of truth was not in
the Scriptures but in the Inner Light. He was arrested (1649), but the
sheriff released him, and the sheriff’s wife became one of his first
converts. He resumed his missionary wandering, entered another church,
and: “I was moved to de - clare the truth to the priest and the people,
but the people fell upon me in great rage, struck me down . . . , and I
was cruelly beaten and bruised by them with their hands, Bibles, and
sticks.” He was again arrested; the magistrate let him go, but the
populace stoned him out of the town. 58 At Derby he preached against
churches and sacraments as vain approaches to God; he was committed to a
house of correction for six months (1650). He was offered release if he
would join the army; he replied by preaching against war. His jailers
now put him “into a lousy, stinking place, low in the ground, without
any bed, among thirty felons, where I was kept almost half a year.” 50
From his prison he wrote to judges and magistrates arguing against
capital punishment, and his intercession may have helped</p>
<p>198 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>to save from the gallows a young woman who had been condemned to
death for stealing.</p>
<p>After a year of imprisonment he resumed his peripatetic gospel.
At</p>
<p>Wakefield he converted James Nayler. At Beverley he entered a church,
listened till the sermon was over, and then asked the preacher was he
not ashamed to “take three hundred pounds a year for preaching the Scrip
- tures?” 60 In another town the minister invited him to preach in the
church; he refused, but addressed a crowd in the churchyard.</p>
<p>I declared to the people that I came not to hold up their idol</p>
<p>temples, nor their priests, nor their tithes, nor . . . their Jewish
and</p>
<p>heathenish ceremonies and traditions (for I denied all these),
and</p>
<p>told them that that piece of ground was no more holy than any</p>
<p>other. . . . Therefore I exhorted the people to come off from all
these things, and directed them to the spirit and grace of God in
themselves, and to the light of Jesus in their own hearts. 61</p>
<p>At Swarthmore, in Yorkshire, he converted Margaret Fell, and then her
husband, Judge Thomas Fell; their home, Swarthmore Hall, became the
first substantial meeting place of the Quakers, and is to this day a
shrine of pilgrimage for Friends.</p>
<p>We must not follow Fox’s story further. His methods wer e crude, but
he atoned for them by the patience with which he bore a long succession
of arrests and bufferings. Puritans, Presbyterians, and Anglicans
attacked him, for he rejected sacraments, churches, and ministers.
Magistrates sent the Quakers to jail not only for disturbing public
worship, and seducing soldiers with pacifism, but also for refusing to
swear allegiance to the government. The Quakers protested that oaths of
any kind are immoral; Yea or Nay should be enough. Cromwell sympathized
with the Quakers, gave Fox a friendly interview (1654) and, parting,
said, “Come again to my house; if thou and I were but an hour of a day
together, we should be nearer one to the other.” 62 In 1657 the
Protector ordered the release of imprisoned Quakers, and sent
instructions to all justices to treat these churchless preachers “as
persons under a strong delusion.” 63</p>
<p>The worst persecution had fallen to the lot of James Nayler, who
carried the doctrine of the Inner Light to the point of believing, or
pretending, that he was Christ reincarnate. Fox reprimanded him, but
some devoted followers worshiped him, and one woman affirmed that he had
restored her to life after she had been two days dead. When Nayler rode
into Bristol women threw their scarves before his horse, and chanted,
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hosts.” He was arrested on a charge
of blasphemy. Questioned as to the claims made by or for him, he would
make no other a nswer but Christ’s “Thou hast said it.” Parliament, then
predominantly</p>
<p>CHAP. Vll)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>Puritan, took up his case (1656), and for eleven days debated whether
he should be put to death. The motion was lost by ninety-six to
eighty-two, but by a spirit of humane compromise he was sentenced to
stand for two hours with his neck in a pillory, to receive 310 lashes,
to have the letter B (for blasphemer) burned into his forehead, and to
have his tongue bored through with a red-hot iron. He suffered these
atrocities bravely; his followers hailed him as a martyr; they kissed
and sucked his wounds. He was committed to solitary confinement, without
pen, paper, fire, or light. Gradually his spirit broke; he confessed
that he had been deluded. He was released in 1659, and died destitute in
i66o. B4</p>
<p>The Quakers distinguished themselves by what seemed to some of their
contemporaries to be troublesome peculiarities. They allowed no
ornaments on their clothing. They refused to take off their hats to any
person, of whatever rank, even in church or palace or at court. They
addressed all persons by the singular thou or thee, instead of by the
originally honorific plural you. They rejected the pagan names of the
days of the week and the months of the year, saying, for example, “the
first day of the sixth month.” They worshiped as readily in the open as
indoors. Each worshiper Was invited to tell what the Holy Ghost had
inspired him to say; then all practiced a reverent silence, probably as
a sedative after enthusiasm — which originally meant “feeling a god
within.” Women were admitted to worship and preaching on the same terms
as men. Matter-of-fact Britons resented the tendency of the early
Quakers to the intemperate denunciation of other sects, and to a certain
pride in election and virtue. Otherwise the Friends were model
Christians. They did not resist evil, they accepted with only verbal
protests the vilest conditions of imprisonment, they did not strike back
at those who beat them. They gave as they could to all who asked. Their
married life was beyond reproach. Their rule against marrying any but
another Quaker limited their growth; nevertheless by 1660 there were
sixty thousand Friends in England. Their reputation for honesty,
courtesy, industry, and thrift raised them from the humble ranks in
which they first appeared into the middle classes that claim most of
them today.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>DEATH AND TAXES</li>
</ol>
<p>It was the middle classes that prospered most under Cromwell; above
all, the merchants engaged in foreign trade. Parilament now included
many men representing or possessing commercial interests. It was in
their behalf that the Navigation Act of 1651 required all colonial
imports into Britain to be carried in English ships — a measure
obviously aimed at the Dutch. Cromwell at times played with the idea of
an alliance with the United</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Provinces for the protection and advancement of Protestantism, but
the London merchants preferred profits to piety, and soon (1652)
Cromwell found himself engaged in the First Dutch War. The results, as
we have seen, were encouraging.</p>
<p>The imperialistic fever rose as the navy grew. Memories of Hawkins
and Drake suggested to the merchants and to Cromwell that the Spanish
hegemony in the Americas might be broken, the lucrative trade in slaves
could be captured for England, and the precious metals of the New World
could be directed to London; moreover, as Cromwell explained, the con-
quest of the West Indies would enable English preachers to convert those
islands from Catholicism to Protestantism. 65 On August 5, 1654,
Cromwell sent to Philip IV of Spain assurances of friendship. In October
he dis- patched a fleet under Blake to the Mediterranean, and in
December another, under William Penn (father of the Quaker) and Robert
Venables, to</p>
<p>seize Hispaniola from Spain. The latter attempt failed, but Penn
captured Jamaica for England (1655).</p>
<p>On November 3, 1655, Cromwell and Mazarin, both subordinating</p>
<p>religion to politics, signed an Anglo-French alliance against Spain.
The war that Spain had continued to wage with France, after the Treaty
of Westphalia (1648), had kept those powers too busy to interfere with
Cromwell’s rise to leadership in England; now it gave his foreign policy
a brilliant if passing success. Blake for a long time watched for the
Spanish Silver fleet coming from America. He found it in the harbor of
Santa Cruz in the Canary Islands, and totally destroyed it (April 20,
1657). English soldiers took the lead in defeating a Spanish army in the
Battle of the Dunes (June 4, 1658). When the Peace of the Pyrenees ended
the war (1659), France ceded Dunkirk to England, and Cromwell appeared
to have retrieved the ignominy of Mary Tudor in losing Calais a century
before. He had proposed to make the name of Englishman as great as ever
that of Roman had been, and he came close to realizing his aim. The
mastery of the seas had now fallen to England; consequently it was only
a matter of time until England would dominate North America and extend
her rule in Asia. All Europe looked in awe upon this Puritan who praised
God but built a navy, who preached sermons but won every battle, who
founded the British Empire by martial force while invoking the name of
Christ. The crowned heads who had counted him an upstart now sought his
alliance, making no fuss about theology.</p>
<p>But John Thurloe, secretary to the Council of State, warned Cromwell
that it was a mistake to help France against Spain; France was rising,
Spain was declining; England’s policy of supporting a balance of power
on the Continent, as a surety for England’ s freedom, required, if not
help to Spain, certainly none to France. Now (1659) France was supreme
on land; the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>road was open for her expansion into the Netherlands, Franche-Comte,
and Lorraine. Many an Englishman’s l ife would be laid down to check the
aggressive ambitions of Louis XIV.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the merchant princes prospered from the wars. The East
India Company was reorganized in 1657 as a joint- stock enterprise; it
“lent” Cromwell sixty thousand pounds to avoid governmental scrutiny of
its affairs; 66 It was now a powerful factor in the economy and politics
of England. The cost of the wars was met by raising taxes beyond any
point reached in the reigns of Charls I or II. Most of the crown lands,
those of the Anglican Church, many Royalist estates, half of Ireland,
were sold by the government; even so it operated at an average annual
deficit of ,£450,000 after 1654. The simple citizen profited little. All
the goals for which the Great Rebellion of 1 642-49 had been fought had
now been set aside. Taxation without representation or parliamentary
approval, arrest without due process of law, trial without jury, were as
flagrant as before; and rule by the army and naked force was made still
more offensive by being coated with religious cant. “The rule of
Cromwell became hated as no government has ever been hated in England
before or since.” 67</p>
<p>England waited impatiently for its Protector’s death. Plots to
assassinate him multiplied. He had to be always on the watch, and now he
raised his bodyguard to 160 men. A former radical, Lieutenant Colonel
Sexby,</p>
<p>engaged one Sundercombe to kill him; the plot was detected
(January,</p>
<p>1657). Sundercombe was arrested, and died in the Tower. In May Sexby
published a pamphlet under the tide Killing No Murder, which was an
outright appeal for the murder of Cromwell. Sexby was found, and he too
died in the Tower. Conspiracies against the Protector took form in the
army, and in royalist circles where hope for a Stuart restoration was
rising feverishly. Cromwell’s eldest daughter, married to the radical
Major General Charles Fleetwood, adopted republican principles, and
deplored her father’s dictatorship. 68</p>
<p>Cares, fears, and bereavements broke the iron man’s spirit . Like so
many others who had tasted power to the dregs, he sometimes regretted
that he had ever left the quiet of his early life as a rural squire. “I
can say in the presence of God … I would have lived under my woodside,
to have kept a flock of sheep, rather than undertook such a government
as this is.” 68 In August, 1658, his best-loved daughter, Elizabeth,
died after a long and painful illness. Shortly after her funeral
Cromwell took to bed with inter- mittent fever. Quinine might have cured
him, but his physician rejected it as a newfangled remedy introduced
into Europe by idolatrous Jesuits. 70 Cromwell seemed to recover, and
spoke bravely. “Do not think that I shall die,” he told his wife; “I am
sure of the contrary.” 71 His Council asked him to name his successor;
he answered, “Richard” — his eldest son. On</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>September 2 he suffered a relapse, and sensed his end. He prayed God
to forgive his sins and protect the Puritans. The next afternoon he
died. Secretary Thurloe wrote, “He is gone to heaven, embalmed with the
tears of his people, and upon the wings of the prayers of the saints.”
72 When news of Cromwell’s death reached Amsterdam the city “was lighted
up as for a great deliverance, and children ran along the canals,
shouting for joy that the Devil was dead.” 73</p>
<p>; VIII. THE ROAD BACK: 1658-60</p>
<p>His son did not have the devil in him, nor the steel that might have
held England in the chains that force and piety had forged. Richard
Cromwell shared with his sister the tenderness of mind that had made
them look with secret dread upon their father’s policy of blood and
iron. Richard, on his knees, had begged Cromwell to spare the life of
Charles I. During the Commonwealth and the Protectorate he had lived
peaceably on the rural estate that his marriage had brought him. It was
through no ambition of his own that on September 4, 1658, by his
father’s will, he became Lord Pro- tector of England. Lucy Hutchinson
described him as “gentle and virtuous, but a peasant in his nature, and
became not greatness.” 74</p>
<p>All the divisions that Oliver had kept in check now emerged, more</p>
<p>boldly as they saw the weakness of Richard’s fi ber. The army,
resenting his civil background, and wishing to keep in its hands the
authority that under his father had been frankly martial, petitioned him
to yield all military direction to Fleetwood. He refused, but mollified
his brother-in-law by making him lieutenant general. As the treasury was
empty and burdened with debt, he summoned a Parliament, which met on
January 27, 1659. A rumor spread that it was planning to reinstate the
Stuart monarchy. The army officers, followed by bands of soldiers, came
to Richard and asked him to dismiss the Parliament. He sent for his
guards to protect him; they ignored his orders. Yielding to force, he
signed an order dissolving the Parliament (April 22). He was now at the
mercy of the army. The ardent republicans in the army, led by Major
General John Lambert, invited the surviving members of the Long
Parliament to reassemble, and to assume the authority which, as the
Rump, they had held until Cromwell, aided by the ardent republicans in
the army, dismissed them in 1653. The new Rump convened at Westminster
May 7, 1659. Richard, weary of politics, sent it his resignation (May
25). He retired into private life, and in 1660 he disappeared into
France, where he lived in seclusion under the pseudonym of John Clarke.
He returned to England in 1680, and died there in 1712, aged
eighty-six.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>“Chaos,” wrote a royalist on June 3, 1659, “was a perfection compared
to our present order and government.” 75 The contest for p ower between
army and Parliament continued; but those parts of the army that were
stationed in Scotland or Ireland favored Parliament, and in the predomi-
nantly republican Parliament there was a strong royalist faction. On
October 13 Lambert stationed soldiers at the entrance to Westminster
Palace, excluded the Parliament, and announced that the army would for
the present take over the government. It seemed as if the whole sequence
of events that had begun with Pride’s Purge was to be repeated, with</p>
<p>Lambert a new Cromwell.</p>
<p>Milton called Lambert’s coup d’etat “most illegal and scandalous, I
fear me barbarous . . . that a paid army . . . should thus subdue the
supreme power that set them up,” 76 but the poet was powerless. The only
force in Britain that could oppose the military dictatorship was another
army, the ten thousand soldiers that Parliament had assigned to General
George Monck to maintain its authority in Scotland. We do not know
whether any personal ambitions were concealed behind Monck’s resolve to
challenge the London army’s usurpation of power. “I am engaged in
conscience and honor,” he declared, “to free England from that
intolerable slavery of a sword</p>
<p>government. ” 77 His statement roused to courage a variety of other
elements opposed to martial rule. The people refused to pay taxes; the
army in Ireland, the fleet in the Downs, the apprentices in the capital
declared for the Parliament. The London financiers refused to the
usurping leaders the loans that had been depended upon for the payment
of the troops. The mercantile and manufacturing classes, which had
approved the deposition of Charles I, now felt that the deepening and
spreading disorder threatened the economic life of England, and began to
wonder whether political or economic stability could be restored without
a king whose legitimacy would comfort the people, bring in taxes, and
quiet the storm. On December 5 Monck led his forces into England. The
army leaders sent troops to oppose him; they refused to fight. The
usurping officers admitted defeat, restored the Parliament, and
submitted themselves to its mercy (December * 4 )-</p>
<p>The triumphal Parliament, numbering thirty-six men, was still re-</p>
<p>publican. One of its first acts required all present and future
members to abjure the Stuart line. It refused admission to the
Presbyterian survivors of the pre-Rump Parliament, on the ground that
they favored the restoration of Charles II. The people scorned it as
merely a revived Rump unrepre- sentative of England, and expressed its
sentiments by the “Roasting of the Rump” in effigy in a multitude of
bonfires — thirty-one in a single London street. Monck, whose army had
reached London on February 3, 1660, notified the Parliament that unless
it called for a new and wider election, and</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>dissolved itself by May 6, he would no longer protect it. He advised
the House to admit the excluded Presbyterians; it did. The enlarged
Commons re-established the presbyterian organization of religion in
England, issued a call for a new election, and declared itself
dissolved. Now at last the Long Parliament came to its official and
legal end (March 16, 1660).</p>
<p>On that same day a workman blotted out with paint the inscription</p>
<p>Exit Tyrannus, Regum Ultimus (“Exit the Tyrant, Last of the
Kings”)</p>
<p>which the Commonwealth had set up in the Exchange; then he threw up
his cap and cried, “God bless King Charles the Second!”; whereupon, we
are told, “the whole Exchange joined with the greatest shout.” 78 The
next day Monck gave a secret interview to Charles’s emissary, Sir John
Greenville. Soon Greenville was on his wa y to Brussels with Monck’s
message to the throneless King.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE KING RETURNS: 1660</li>
</ol>
<p>Since his 7 arduous escape from England in 1650, Charles had led
almost a vagabond’s life on the Continent. His mother, Henrietta Maria,
received him in Paris; but the French had impoverished her, and for a
while Charles and his entourage lived like paupers; his faithful future
Chancellor, Edward Hyde, was reduced to one meal a day; and Charles
himself, having no food at home, ate in taverns, mostly on the credit of
his expectations. When Louis XIV returned to affluence he gave Charles a
pension of six thousand francs, and Charles began to enjoy life too
freely to please his mother. In those Paris days he learned to love with
his purest affection his sister, Henrietta Anne. Mother and sister
exerted themselves to win him to Catholicism; Catholic emigres from
England did not let him forget how they had fought for his father.
Presbyterian emissaries promised to aid his restoration if he would
accept and protect their faith. He listened to both sides courteously,
but expressed his determination to adhere to that Anglican Church for
which his father had suffered. 79 The arguments that besieged him may
have inclined him to a skepticism of all religion. But the Catholic
worship, which he saw all around him in France, seems to have made a
strong impression on him; it became an open secret in his little court
that if his hands were free he would join the Roman Church. 80 In 1651
he wrote to Pope Innocent X, promising, if restored to the throne of
England, to repeal all laws against Catholics. The Pope made no answer,
but the general of the Jesuits informed Charles that the Vatican could
not support an heretical prince. 81</p>
<p>When Mazarin began to negotiate an alliance with Cromwell, Charles’s
advisers persuaded him to leave France, and the Cardinal agreed to
continue</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>CROMWELL</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>his pension. He moved to Cologne, then to Brussels. There, toward
March 26, 1660, Gr eenville brought him Monck’s message: If he would
promise a general amnesty, excepting not more than four persons, grant
liberty of conscience, and confirm the present possessors of confiscated
property, Monck would help him; meanwhile, since England was still at
war with Spain, it would be advisable for Charles to leave the Spanish
Netherlands. He moved to Breda in Dutch Brabant, and there (April 14)
signed an agreement accepting Monck’s terms in principle, but leaving
precise con - ditions to the new Parliament.</p>
<p>The elections returned an overwhelmingly royalist House of Commons,
and forty-two peers took their seats in the new House of Lords. On May 1
the letters that Greenville had brought from Charles were read to both
houses. In this “Declaration of Breda” the young King offered amnesty to
all, “excepting only such persons as shall hereafter be excepted by
Parlia - ment”; he left to Parliament the adjustment of confiscated
properties; he promised that “no man shall be disquie ted or called in
question for dif- ferences of opinion in matters of religion which do
not disturb the peace of the Kingdom”; and he added a judicious
statement prepared for him by Chancellor Hyde:</p>
<p>We do assure you upon our royal word that none of our predeces-</p>
<p>sors have had a greater esteem of Parliament than we have . . .
We</p>
<p>do believe them to be so vital a part of the constitution of the
King-</p>
<p>dom, and so necessary to the government of it, that we well know</p>
<p>neither prince nor people can be in any tolerable degree happy with-
out them . . . We shall always look upon their counsels as the best</p>
<p>we can receive, and shall be as tender of their privileges, and as
careful to preserve and protect them, as of that which is most near to
ourself, and most necessary for our own preservation.</p>
<p>Parliament was pleased. On May 8 it proclaimed Charles II King of
England, dated his title from the moment of his father’s death, and
derived it not from any act of Parliament but from inherent birthright.
The sum of fifty thousand pounds was voted to be sent to Charles, with
an invitation to come at once and take his throne.</p>
<p>Nearly all England rejoiced that two decades of violence had ended in
the restoration of order without the shedding of one drop of blood.
Bells rang throughout the land; in London men knelt in the streets and
drank to the health of the King. 82 All the crowned heads of Europe
acclaimed the triumph of legitimacy; even the United Provinces, firmly
republican, feted Charles as he traveled from Breda to The Hague, and
the States-General, which had heretofore ignored him, offered him thirty
thousand pounds for his expenses, as a persuasive to future good will.
An English fleet, already</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>decked with pennants and the initials “C. R.,” came to The Hague and
took Carolus Rex on board (May 23).</p>
<p>On May 25 the fleet reached Dover. Twenty thousand people had</p>
<p>gathered on the beach to receive the King. When his boat neared the
shore they fell on their knees; and he, touching land, knelt and thanked
God. “Old men who were there,” wrote Voltaire, “told me that nearly
everyone was in tears. Perhaps there has never been a more moving
sight.” 83 Along roads lined in every mile with happy crowds Charles and
his escort,</p>
<p>followed by hundreds, rode to Canterbury, to Rochester, to London.
There 120,000 citizens came out to welcome him; and even the army that
had fought against him joined Monck’s army in the parade. The houses of
Parliament awaited him in the Palace of Whitehall. “Dread Sovereign,”
said the Speaker of the Lords, “you are the desire of three kingdoms,
the strength and stay of the tribes of the people, for the moderating of
ex- tremities, the reconciling of differences . . . and for restoring
the collapsed honor of these nations.” 84 Charles accepted all
compliments with grace and private humor. As he retired to his rest,
exhausted with triumph, he re- marked to a friend, “It must surely have
been my fault that I did not come before, for I have met with no one
today who did not protest that he always wished for my restoration.”
