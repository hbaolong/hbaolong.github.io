<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>The Greek Conquest</p>
<p>2OI-I46 B.C.</p>
<p>I. THE CONQUEST OF GREECE</p>
<p>W HEN Philip V of Macedon made an alliance with Hannibal against</p>
<p>Rome (214) he hoped that all Greece would unite behind him</p>
<p>to slay the growing young giant of the west. But rumors were about
that he was planning, if Carthage won, to conquer all Greece with
Carthage’s</p>
<p>He was a youth of thirty, one of that liberal Hellenizing circle
which</p>
<p>was gathering about the Scipios in Rome. After some careful
maneuvering he met Philip at Cynoscephalae and overwhelmed him (197).
Then he sur- prised all the Mediterranean nations, and perhaps Rome, by
restoring the chastened Philip to a bankrupt and weakened throne, and
offering freedom to all Greece. The imperialists in the Senate
protested; but for a moment the liberals predominated, and in 196 the
herald of Flamininus announced to a vast assemblage at the Isthmian
games that Greece was to be free from Rome, from Macedon, from tribute,
even from garrisons. So great a cheer rose from the multitude, says
Plutarch, that crows flying over the stadium fell dead . 2 When a
cynical world questioned the sincerity of the Roman general he answered
by withdrawing his army to Italy. It was a bright page in the history of
war.</p>
<p>But one war always invites another. The Aetolian League resented
Rome’s emancipation of Greek cities formerly subject to the League, and
appealed</p>
<p>8j</p>
<p>86 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. V</p>
<p>to Antiochus III, the Seleucid king, to reliberate liberated Greece.
Inflated with some easy victories in the East, Antiochus thought of
extending his power over all western Asia. Pergamum, fearing him, called
to Rome for help. The Senate sent Scipio Africanus and his brother
Lucius with the first Roman army to touch Asiatic soil; the hostile
forces met at Magnesia (189), and Rome’s victory inaugurated her
conquest of the Hellenistic East. The Romans marched north, drove back
into Galatia (Anatolia) the Gauls who had threatened Pergamum, and
earned the gratitude of all Ionian Greeks.</p>
<p>The Greeks of Europe were not so pleased. Roman armies had spared
Greek soil, but they now encompassed Greece on east and west. Rome had
freed the Greeks, but on condition that both war and class war should
end. Freedom without war was a novel and irksome life for the
city-states that made up Hellas; the upper classes yearned to play power
politics against neigh- boring cities, and the poor complained that Rome
everywhere buttressed the rich against the poor. In 171 Perseus, son and
successor of Philip V as King of Macedon, having arranged an alliance
with Seleucus IV and Rhodes, called upon Greece to rise with him against
Rome. Three years later Lucius Aemilius Paulus, son of the consul who
had fallen at Cannae, defeated Perseus at Pydna, razed seventy
Macedonian towns, and led Perseus captive to grace a magnificent triumph
at Rome.* Rhodes was punished by the emancipation of her tributary
cities in Asia, and by the establishment of a competitive port at Delos.
A thousand Greek leaders, including the historian Polybius, were taken
as hostages to Italy, where, in sixteen years of exile, 700 of them
died.</p>
<p>During the next decade the relations between Greece and Rome moved
even nearer to open enmity. The rival cities, factions, and classes of
Hellas appealed to the Senate for support, and gave cause for
interferences that made Greece actually subject though nominally free.
The partisans of the Scipios in the Senate were overruled by realists
who felt that there would be no lasting peace or order in Greece until
it was completely under Roman rule. In 146 the cities of the Achaean
League, while Rome was in conflict with Carthage and Spain, announced a
war of liberation. Leaders of the poor seized control of the movement,
freed and armed the slaves, declared a moratorium on debts, promised a
redistribution of land, and added revolu-</p>

<p>tion to war. When the Romans under Mummius entered Greece they found
a divided people and easily overcame the undisciplined Greek troops.
Mummius burned Corinth, slew its males, sold its women and children into
bondage, and carried nearly all its movable wealth and art to Rome.
Greece and Macedon were made into a Roman province under a Roman
governor; only Athens and Sparta were allowed to remain under their own
laws. Greece disappeared from political history for two thousand
years.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROME</li>
</ol>
<p>Step by step the Roman Empire grew, not so much through conscious
design as through the compulsions of circumstance and the ever receding
frontiers of security. In bloody battles at Cremona (200) and Mutina
(193) the legions again subdued Cisalpine Gaul and pushed the boundaries
of Italy to the Alps. Spain, rewon from Carthage, had to be kept under
control lest Carthage should win it again; besides, it was rich in iron,
silver, and gold. The Senate exacted from it a heavy annual tribute in
the form of bullion and coin, and the Roman governors reimbursed
themselves liberally for spending a year away from home; so Quintus
Minucius, after a brief pro- consulate in Spain, brought to Rome 34,800
pounds of silver and 35,000 silver denarii. Spaniards were conscripted
into the Roman army; Scipio Aemilianus had 40,000 of them in the force
with which he took Spanish Numantia. In 195 b.c. the tribes broke out in
wild revolt, which Marcus Cato put down with a hard integrity that
recalled the proud virtues of a vanishing Roman breed. Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus (179) adjusted his rule sympathetically to the
character and civilization of the native popu- lation, made friends of
the tribal chieftains, and distributed land among the poor. But one of
his successors, Lucius Lucullus ( 1 5 1 ), violated the treaties made by
Gracchus, attacked without cause any tribe that could yield plunder, and
slaughtered or enslaved thousands of Spaniards without bother- ing to
invent a pretext. Sulpicius Galba (150) lured 7000 natives to his camp
by a treaty promising them land; when they arrived he had them sur-
rounded and enslaved or massacred. In 154 the tribes of Lusitania
(Portugal) began a sixteen-year war against Rome. An able leader,
Viriathus, appeared among them, heroic in stature, endurance, courage,
and nobility; for eight years he defeated every army sent against him,
until at last the Romans purchased his assassination. The rebellious
Celtiberians of central Spain bore a siege of fifteen months in
Numantia, living on their dead; at last (133) Scipio Aemilianus starved
them into surrender. In general the policy of the</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>Roman Republic in Spain was so brutal and dishonest that it cost more
than it paid. “Never,” said Mommsen, “had war been waged with so much
perfidy, cru elty, and avarice.” 4</p>
<p>The plunder from the provinces provided the funds for that orgy
of</p>
<p>corrupt and selfish wealth which was to consume the Republic in
revolu- tion. The indemnities paid by Carthage, Macedon, and Syria, the
slaves that poured into Rome from every field of glory, the precious
metals captured in the conquest of Cisalpine Gaul and Spain, the
400,000,000 sesterces (0,000,000) taken from Antiochus and Perseus, the
4503 pounds of gold and 220,000 pounds of silver seized by Manlius Vulso
in his Asiatic cam- paigns 8 — these and other windfalls turned the
propertied classes in Rome in half a century (202-146 b.c.) from men of
means into persons of such opulence as hitherto only monarchs had known.
Soldiers returned from these gigantic raids with their pouches full of
coins and spoils. As currency multiplied in Italy faster than building,
the owners of realty in the capital tripled their fortunes without
stirring a muscle or a nerve. Industry lagged while commerce flourished;
Rome did not have to produce goods; it took the world’s money and paid
with that for the world’s goods. Public works were expanded beyond
precedent and enriched the “publicans” who lived on state contracts; any
Roman who had a little money bought shares in their corporations.®
Bankers proliferated and prospered; they paid interest on deposits,
cashed checks ( praescriptiones ), met bills for their clients, lent and
borrowed money, made or managed investments, and fattened on such
relentless usury that cutthroat ( sector ) and moneylender became one
word. 7 Rome was becoming not the industrial or commercial, but the
financial and political, center of the white man’s world.</p>
<p>Equipped with such means, the Roman patriciate and upper middle class
passed with impressive speed from stoic simplicity to recldess luxury;
the lifetime of Cato (234-149) saw the transformation almost completed.
Houses became larger as families became smaller; furniture grew lavish
in a race for conspicuous expense; great sums were paid for Babylonian
rugs, for couches inlaid with ivory, silver, or gold; precious stones
and metals shone on tables and chairs, on the bodies of women, on the
harness of horses. As physical exertion diminished and wealth expanded,
the old simple diet gave way to long and heavy meals of meat, game,
delicacies, and condi- ments. Exotic foods were indispensable to social
position or pretense; one magnate paid a thousand sesterces for the
oysters served at a meal; another imported anchovies at 1600 sesterces a
cask; another paid 1 200 for a jar of caviar. 8 Good chefs fetched
enormous prices on the slave auction block. Drinking increased; goblets
had to be large and preferably of gold; wine</p>
<p>CHAP, v) THE GREEK CONQUEST 89</p>
<p>was less diluted, sometimes not at all. Sumptuary laws were passed by
the Senate limiting expenditure on banquets and clothing, but as the
senators ignored these regulations, no one bothered to observe them.
“The citizens,” Cato mourned, “no longer listen to good advice, for the
belly has no ears.” 0 The individual became rebelliously conscious of
himself as against the state, the son as against the father, the woman
as against the man.</p>
<p>Usually the power of woman rises with the wealth of a society, for
when the stomach is satisfied hunger leaves the field to love.
Prostitution flourished. Homosexualism was stimulated by contact with
Greece and Asia; many rich men paid a talent (600) for a male favorite;
Cato complained that a pretty boy cost more than a farm. 10 But women
did not yield the field to these Greek and Syrian invaders. They took
eagerly to all those supports of beauty that wealth now put within their
reach. Cosmetics became a neces- sity, and caustic soap imported from
Gaul tinged graying hair into auburn locks. 11 The rich bourgeois took
pride in adorning his wife and daughter with costly clothing or jewelry
and made them the town criers of his pros- perity. Even in government
the role of women grew. Cato cried out that “all other men rule over
women; but we Romans, who rule all men, are ruled by our women.” 12 In
195 b.c. the free women of Rome swept into the Forum and demanded the
repeal of the Oppian Law of 2 1 5, which had forbidden women to use gold
ornaments, varicolored dresses, or chariots. Cato predicted the ruin of
Rome if the law should be repealed. Livy puts into his mouth a speech
that every generation has heard:</p>
<p>If we had, each of us, upheld the rights and authority of the
hus-</p>
<p>band in our own households, we should not today have this trouble
with our women. As things are now, our liberty of action, which has been
annulled by female despotism at home, is crushed and trampled on here in
the Forum. . . . Call to mind all the regulations respecting women by
which our ancestors curbed their license and made them obedient to their
husbands; and yet with all those restrictions you</p>
<p>can scarcely hold them in. If now you permit them to remove these</p>
<p>restraints . . . and to put themselves on an equality with their
hus-</p>
<p>bands, do you imagine that you will be able to bear them? From the
moment that they become your equals they will be your masters . 18</p>
<p>The women laughed him down, and stood their ground until the law was
repealed. Cato revenged himself as censor by multiplying by ten the
taxes on the articles that Oppius had forbidden. But the tide was in
flow, and could not be turned. Other laws disadvantageous to women were
repealed or modified or ignored. Women won the free administration of
their dowries, divorced their husbands or occasionally poisoned them,
and</p>
<p>90 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. V</p>
<p>doubted the wisdom of bearing children in an age of urban congestion
and imperialistic wars.</p>
<p>Already by 1 60 Cato and Polybius had noted a decline of population
and the inability of the state to raise such armies as had risen to meet
Hannibal. The new generation, having inherited world mastery, had no
time or inclina- tion to defend it; that readiness for war which had
characterized the Roman landowner disappeared now that ownership was
being concentrated in a few families and a proletariat without stake in
the country filled the slums of Rome. Men became brave by proxy; they
crowded the amphitheater to see bloody games, and hired gladiators to
fight before them at their ban- quets. Finishing schools were opened for
both sexes, where young men and women learned to sing, play the lyre,
and move gracefully. 14 In the upper classes manners became more refined
as morals were relaxed. In the lower classes manners continued to be
coarse and vigorous, amusements often violent, language freely obscene;
we get the odor of this lusty profamtm vulgus in Plautus, and understand
why it wearied of Terence. When a band of flute players attempted a
musical concert at a triumph in 167, the audience forced the musicians
to change their performance into a boxing match. 10</p>
<p>In the widening middle classes commercialism ruled unhindered. Their
wealth was based no longer on realty but on mercantile investment or
man- agement. The old morality and a few Catos could not keep this new
regime of mobile capital from setting the tone of Roman life. Everyone
longed for money, everyone judged or was judged in terms of money.
Contractors cheated on such a scale that many government properties —
e.g., the Mace- donian mines — had to be abandoned because the lessees
exploited the work- ers and mulcted the state to a point where the
enterprise brought in more tribulation than profit. 10 That aristocracy
which (if we may believe the historians — and we must not) had once
esteemed honor above life adopted the new morality and shared in the new
wealth; it thought no longer of the nation, but of class and individual
privileges and perquisites; it accepted presents and liberal bribes for
bestowing its favor upon men or states, and found ready reasons for war
with countries that had more wealth than power. Patricians stopped
plebeians in the street and asked or paid for their votes. It became a
common thing for magistrates to embezzle public funds and an uncommon
thing to see them prosecuted; for who could punish rob- bery among his
fellows when half the members of the Senate had joined in violating
treaties, robbing allies, and despoiling provinces? “He who steals from
a citizen,” said Cato, “ends his days in fetters and chains; but he who
steals from the community ends them in purple and gold.” 17</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the prestige of the Senate was higher than ever before.
It</p>
<p>CHAP, v) THE GREEK CONQUEST 91</p>
<p>had brought Rome successfully through two Punic Wars and three Mace-
donian Wars; it had challenged and overcome all of Rome’s rivals, had
won the subservient friendship of Egypt, and had captured so much of the
world’s wealth that in 146 Italy was freed from direct taxation. In the
crises of war and policy it had usurped many powers of the assemblies
and the magis- trates, but victory sanctified its usurpations. The
machinery of the comitia had been made ridiculous by empire; the
turbulent peoples who now sub- mitted to rule by a Senate largely
composed of seasoned statesmen and tri- umphant generals would have
protested passionately against having their affairs determined by the
few thousand Italians who could attend the assem- blies in Rome. The
principle of democracy is freedom, the principle of war is discipline;
each requires the absence of the other. War demands superior
intelligence and courage, quick decisions, united action, immediate
obedi- ence; the frequency of war doomed democracy. By law the Centurial
As- sembly alone had the right to declare war or make peace; but by its
power to conduct foreign relations the Senate could usually bring
matters to a point where the Assembly had no longer any practical
choice. 18 The Senate controlled the Treasury and all outlays of public
funds; and it controlled the judiciary by the rule that all important
juries had to be taken from the Senatorial list. The formulation and
interpretation of the laws were in the hands of the patrician class.</p>
<p>Within this aristocracy there was an oligarchy of dominant families.
Till Sulla, Roman history is a record of families rather than of
individuals; no great statesman stands out, but generation after
generation the same names occur in the higher offices of the state. Out
of 200 consuls between 233 and 133 b.c., 159 belonged to twenty-six
families, one hundred to ten. The most powerful family in this period
was the Cornelii. From the Publius Cornelius Scipio who lost the battle
of the Trebia (218), through his son Scipio Africanus who defeated
Hannibal, to the latter’s adoptive grandson, Scipio Aemilianus, who
destroyed Carthage in 146, the history of Roman politics and war is
largely the story of this family; and the revolution that destroyed the
aristocracy was begun by the Gracchi, grandsons of Africanus. The saving
victory at Zama made Africanus so popular with all classes that for a
time Rome was ready to give him any office he desired. But when he and
his brother Lucius returned from the war in Asia (187), the party of
Cato demanded that Lucius should give an account of the money paid him
by Antiochus as an indemnity to be transmitted to Rome. Africanus
refused to let his brother answer; instead he tore the records to shreds
before the Senate. Lucius was brought to trial before the Assembly and
was con- victed of embezzlement; he was saved from punishment by the
tribunician</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>9 2</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>veto of Africanus’ son -in-law, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus.
Summoned to trial in his turn, Africanus disrupted the proceedings by
inviting and lead- ing the Assembly to the Temple of Jupiter to
celebrate the anniversary of Zama. Summoned again, he refused to obey
the call, retired to his estate at Litemum, and remained there
unmolested till his death. The emergence of such individualism in
politics corresponded with the growth of individu- alism in commerce and
morals. The Roman Republic would soon be de- stroyed by the unfettered
energy of its great men.</p>
<p>The redeeming feature of this aristocracy and this age was their
awakened appreciation of the beautiful. Contact with Greek culture in
Italy, Sicily, and Asia had acquainted the Romans not merely with the
appurtenances of luxury but with the highest products of classic art.
The conquerors brought back with them world-famous paintings and
statues, cups and mirrors of chased metal, costly textiles and
furniture. The older generation was shocked by Marcellus’ adornment of
Roman squares with the stolen sculptures of Syracuse; they com- plained
not of the ro bbery, but of the “idleness and vain talk” among once in -
dustrious citizens who now stopped to “examine and criticize trifles.”
10 Fulvius carried off 1015 statues from Pyrrhus’ collection in
Ambracia; Aemilius Paulus filled fifty chariots in his triumph with the
art treasures he had taken from Greece as partial payment for liberating
her; Sulla, Verres, Nero, and a thousand other Romans were to do
likewise through two hundred years. Greece was denuded to clothe the
Roman mind.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with this invasion, Italian art abandoned its native
quality and styles and, with one exception, surrendered to Greek
artists, themes, and forms. Greek sculptors, painters, and architects,
following the line of greatest gold, migrated to Rome and slowly
Hellenized the capital of their conquerors. Rich Romans began to build
their mansions in the Greek manner around an open court, and to adorn
them with Greek columns, statuary, paintings, and furni- ture. Temples
changed more slowly, lest the gods take offense; for them the short
cella and high podium of the Tuscan style remained the rule; but as more
Olympians were domiciled in Rome it seemed appropriate to design their
homes on the slenderer Hellenic scale. In one vital respect, however,
Roman art, while still taking hints from Greece, expressed with unique
means and power the sturdy Italic soul. For triumphal and decorative
monuments, basilicas and aque- ducts, the Roman architect replaced the
architrave with the arch. In 184 Cato built in stone the Basilica
Porcia; five years later Aemilius Paulus gave its first form to that
Basilica Aemilia which his descendants would repair and beautify through
many generations.* The typical Roman basilica, designed for the
transaction of business or law, was a long rectangle divided into nave
and aisles</p>

could be carved above each aisle for the admission of light and air.
Here, of course, was the essential in- terior form of the medieval
cathedral. With these vast edifices Rome began to take on that aspect of
magnificence and strength which was to distinguish the city even after
it ceased to be the capital of the world.</p>

<li>THE NEW GODS</li>
</ol>
<p>How were the old gods faring in this age of reckless change?
Apparently a rivulet of unbelief had trickled down from the aristocracy
to the crowd; it is hard to understand how a people still faithful to
the ancient pantheon could have accepted with such boisterous approval
those comedies in which Plautus — with whatever excuse of following
Greek models — made fun of Jupiter’s labors with Alcmena, and turned
Merc ury into a buffoon. Even Cato, so anxious to preserve old forms,
marveled at the ability of two augurs to keep from laughing when they
met face to face. 21 Too long these takers of auspices had been suborned
to political trickery; prodigies and portents had been concocted to mold
public opinion, the vote of the people had been annulled by pious
humbuggery, and religion had consented to turn exploitation into a
sacrament. It was a bad omen that Polybius, after living seventeen years
among the highest circles in Rome, could write, about 150 b.c., as if
the Roman religion were merely a tool of government:</p>
<p>The quality in which the Roman commonwealth is most distinctly</p>
<p>superior is, in my judgment, the nature of its religion. The very
thing that among other nations is an object of reproach — i.e.,
superstition — is that which maintains the cohesion of the Roman state.
These mat- ters are clothed in such pomp, and introduced to such an
extent into public and private life, as no other religion can parallel.
… I be-</p>
<p>lieve that the government has adopted this course for the sake of the
common people. This might not have been necessary had it been pos- sible
to form a state composed of wise men; but as every multitude is fickle,
full of lawless desires, unreasoned passion, and violent anger, it must
be held in by invisible terrors and religious pageantry. 22</p>
<p>Polybius could have justified himself, perhaps, by recent incidents
tend- ing to show that, despite Plautus and philosophy, superstition
still was king. When the disaster of Cannae seemed to leave Rome
defenseless against Hannibal, the excitable populace fell into a panic,
and cried, “To what god must we pray to save Rome?” The Senate sought to
still the commotion by</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>human sacrifice; thenby prayers to Greek gods; then by applying the
Greek ritual to all the gods, Roman and Greek alike. Finally the Senate
decided that if it could not prevent superstition it would organize and
control it. In 205 it announced that the Sibylline Books foretold that
Hannibal would leave Italy if the Magna Mater — a form of the goddess
Cybele — should be brought from Phrygian Pessinus to Rome. Attalus, King
of Pergamum, con- sented; the black stone which was believed to be the
incarnation of the Great Mother was shipped to Ostia, where it was
received with impressive cere- mony by Scipio Africanus and a band of
virtuous matrons. When the vessel that bore it was grounded in the
Tiber’s mud, the Vestal Virgin Claudia freed it, and drew it upstream to
Rome, by the magic power of her chastity. Then the matrons, each holding
the stone tenderly in her turn, carried it in solemn procession to the
Temple of Victory, and the pious people burned incense at their doors as
the Great Mother passed. The Senate was shocked to find that the new
divinity had to be served by self-emasculated priests; such men were
found, but no Roman was allowed to be among them. From that time onward
Rome celebrated, every April, the Megalesia, or Feast of the Great
Goddess, first with wild sorrow and then with wild rejoicing. For Cybele
was a vegetation deity, and legend told how her son Attis, symbol of
autumn and spring, had died and gone to Hades, and then had risen from
the dead.</p>
<p>In that same year (205) Hannibal left Italy, and the Senate
complimented itself on its handling of the religious crisis. But the
wars with Macedon opened the gates to Greece and the East; in the wake
of soldiers returning with Eastern spoils, ideas, and myths came a flood
of Greek and Asiatic captives, slaves, refugees, traders, travelers,
athletes, artists, actors, musicians, teachers, and lecturers; and men
in their migrations carry along their gods. The lower classes of Rome
were pleased to learn of Dionysus-Bacchus, of Orpheus and Eurydice, of
mystic rites that gave a divine inspiration and intoxication, of
initiations that revealed the resurrected deity and promised the
worshiper eternal life. In 186 the Senate was disturbed to learn that a
considerable minority of the people had adopted the Dionysian cult, and
that the new god was being celebrated by nocturnal bacchanalia whose
secrecy lent color to rumors of unrestrained drinking and sexual
revelry. “More uncleanliness was wrought with men than with women,” says
Livy; and he adds, probably turning gossip into history, that “whoever
would not submit to defilement . . . was sacrificed as a victim.” 23 The
Senate sup - pressed the cult, arrested 7000 of the devotees, and
sentenced hundreds to death. It was a temporary victory in the long war
that Rome was to wage against Oriental faiths.</p>

<p>THE GREEK CONQUEST</p>
<p>95</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE COMING OF PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>The Greek conquest of Rome took the form of sending Greek religion
and comedy to the Roman plebs; Greek morals, philosophy, and art to the
upper classes. These Greek gifts conspired with wealth and empire in
that sapping of Roman faith and character which was one part of Hellas’
long revenge upon her conquerors. The conquest reached its climax in
Roman philosophy, from the stoic Epicureanism of Lucretius to the
epicurean Stoicism of Seneca. In Christian theology Greek metaphysics
overcame the gods of Italy. Greek culture triumphed in the rise of
Constantinople as first the rival and then the successor of Rome; and
when Constantinople fell, Greek literature, philosophy, and art
reconquered Italy and Europe in the Renaissance. This is the central
stream in the history of European civili- zation; all other currents are
tributaries. “It was no little brook that flowed from Greece into our
city,” said Cicero, “but a mighty river of culture and learning.” 24
Henceforth the mental, artistic, and religious life of Rome was a part
of the Hellenistic world.*</p>
<p>The invading Greeks found a strategic opening in the schools and lec-
ture halls of Rome. A swelling stream of Graeculi — “Greeklings,” as the
scornful Romans called them — followed the armies returning from the
East. Many of them, as slaves, became tutors in Roman families; some,
the gram- matici, inaugurated secondary education in Rome by opening
schools for instruction in the language and literature of Greece; some,
the rhetor es, gave private instruction and public lectures on oratory,
literary composition, and philosophy. Roman orators — even the
mishellenist Cato — began to model their addresses on the speeches of
Lysias, Aeschines, and Demosthenes. Few of these Greek teachers had any
religious belief; fewer transmitted any; a small minority of them
followed Epicurus and preceded Lucretius in describing religion as the
chief evil in human life. The patricians saw where die wind was blowing,
and tried to stop it; in 173 the Senate banished two Epicureans, and in
16 1 it decreed that “no philosophers or rhetors shall be perm itted in
Rome.” The wind would not stop. In 1 59 Crates of Mallus, Stoic head of
the royal library at Pergamum, came to Rome on an official embassy,
broke a leg, stayed on, and, while convalescing, gave lec- tures on
literature and philosophy. In 155 Athens sent as ambassadors to Rome the
leaders of its three great philosophical schools: Cameades the Academic
or Platonist, Critolaus the Peripatetic or Aristotelian, and Diog-</p>

</ul>
<p>9 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. V</p>
<p>enes the Stoic of Seleucia. Their coining was almost as strong a
stimulus as Chrysoloras would bring to Italy in 1453. Cameades spoke on
eloquence so eloquently that the younger set came daily to hear him. 25
He was a com- plete skeptic, doubted the existence of the gods, and
argued that as good reasons could be given for doing injustice as for
being just — a belated sur- render of Plato to Thrasymachus. 20 When old
Cato heard of this he moved in the Senate that the ambassadors be sent
home. They were. But the new generation had tasted the wine of
philosophy; and from this time onward the rich youth of Rome went
eagerly to Athens and Rhodes to exchange their oldest faith for the
newest doubts.</p>
<p>The very conquerors of Greece were in person the sponsors of
Hellenistic culture and philosophy in Rome. Flamininus, who had loved
Greek litera- ture before invading Macedon and freeing Greece, was
deeply moved by the art and drama he saw in Hellas. We must lay it to
the credit side of Rome that some of its generals could understand
Polycleitus and Pheidias, Scopas and Praxiteles, even if they carried
their appreciation to the point of robbery. Of all the spoils that
Aemilius Paulus brought back from his victories over Perseus, he kept
for himself only the library of the King, as a heritage for his
children. He had his sons instructed in Greek literature and philosophy
as well as in the Roman arts of the chase and war; and so far as his
public duties permitted he shared in these studies with his
children.</p>
<p>Before Paulus died, his youngest son was adopted by his friend, P.
Cor- nelius Scipio, son of Africanus. Following Roman custom, the lad
took the name of his adoptive father and added the name of his father’s
clan; in this way he became the P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus whom we
shall hereafter mean by Scipio. He was a handsome and healthy youth,
simple in habits and moderate in speech, affectionate and generous, so
honest that at his death, after having all the plunder of Carthage pass
through his hands, he left only thirty-three pounds of silver and two of
gold — though he had lived like a scholar rather than as a man of means.
In his youth he met the Greek exile Polybius, who earned his gratitude
and lifelong friendship by giving him good advice and good books. The
boy won his spurs by fighting under his father at Pydna; in Spain he
accepted the challenge of the enemy to single combat, and won. 27</p>
<p>In private life he gathered about him a group of distinguished Romans
interested in Greek thought. Chief among them was Gaius Laelius, a man
of kindly wisdom and steadfast friendship, just in judgment and
blameless in life, and second only to Aemilianus in eloquence of speech
and purity of style. Cicero, across a century, fell in love with
Laelius, named after him his essay on friendship, and wished he might
have lived not in his own turbu-</p>

<p>97</p>
<p>lent epoch but in that exalted circle of Rome’s intellectual youth.
Its in - fluence on literature was considerable; through participation
in it Terence developed the elegant precision of his language; and Gaius
Lucilius (180-</p>
<ol start="103" type="1">
<li>perhaps learned here to give a social purpose to the satires with
which he lashed the vices and luxury of the age.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Greek mentors of this group were Polybius and Panaetius. Polybius
lived for years in Scipio’s home. He was a realist and a rationalist,
and had few illusions about men and states. Panaetius came from Rhodes
and, like Polybius, belonged to the Greek aristocracy. For many years he
lived with Scipio in affectionate intimacy and reciprocal influence: he
stirred Scipio to all the nobility of Stoicism, and probably it was
Scipio who persuaded him to modify the extreme ethical demands of that
philosophy into a more practicable creed. In a book On Duties Panaetius
laid down the central ideas of Stoicism: that man is part of a whole and
must co-operate with it — with his family, his country, and the divine
Soul of the World; that he is here not to enjoy the pleasures of the
senses, but to do his duty without com- plaint or stint. Panaetius did
not, like the earlier Stoics, require a perfect virtue, or complete
indifference to the goods and fortunes of life. Educated Romans grasped
at this philosophy as a dignified and presentable substitute for a faith
in which they had ceased to believe, and found in its ethic a moral code
completely congenial to their traditions and ideals. Stoicism became the
inspiration of Scipio, the ambition of Cicero, the better self of
Seneca, the guide of Trajan, the consolation of Aurelius, and the
conscience of Rome.</p>
<p>V. THE AWAKENING OF LITERATURE</p>
<p>It was a basic purpose of the Scipionic circle to encourage
literature as well as philosophy, to mold the Latin tongue into a
refined and fluent literary medium, to lure the Roman muses to the
nourishing springs of Greek poetry, and to provide an audience for
promising writers of verse or prose. In 204 Scipio Africanus proved his
character by welcoming to Rome a poet brought there by Cato, the
strongest opponent of everything represented by the Scipios and their
friends. Quintus Ennius had been bom of Greek and Italian parentage near
Brundisium (239). He had received his education in Tarentum, and his
enthusiastic spirit had been deeply impressed by the Greek dramas
presented on the Tarentine stage. His courage as a soldier in Sardinia
attracted Cato, who was quaestor there. Arrived in Rome, he lived by
teaching Latin and Greek, recited his verses to his friends, and found
admittance to the circle of the Scipios.</p>
<p>There was hardly a poetic form that he did not try. He wrote a
few</p>
<p>98 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. V</p>
<p>comedies and at least twenty tragedies. He was in love with
Euripides, flirted like him with radical ideas, and plagued the pious
with such Epi- curean quips as, “I grant you there are gods, but they
don’t care what men do; else it would go well with the good and ill with
the bad — which rarely happens”; 28 according to Cicero the audience
applauded the lines . 29 He translated or paraphrased Euhemerus’ Sacred
History , which argued that the gods were merely dead heroes deified by
popular sentiment. He was not immune to theology of a kind, for he
announced that the soul of Homer, having passed through many bodies,
including Pythagoras and a peacock, now resided in Ennius. He wrote with
verve an epic history of Rome from Aeneas to Pyrrhus, and these Annales
became, till Virgil, the national poem of Italy. A few fragments
survive, of which the most famous is a line that Roman conservatives
never tired of quoting:</p>
<p>Moribus antiquis stat res Romana virisque —</p>
<p>“the Roman state stands through its ancient morals and its great
men.” Metrically the poem was a revolution; it replaced the loose
“Saturnian” verse of Naevius with the flowing and flexible hexameters of
Greek epic poetry. Ennius molded Latin to new forms and powers, filled
his lines with the meat of thought, and prepared for Lucretius, Horace,
and Virgil in method, vocabulary, theme, and ideas. To crown his career
he wrote a treatise on the pleasures of the palate, and died of gout at
seventy, after com- posing a proud epitaph:</p>
<p>Pay me no tears, nor for my passing grieve;</p>
<p>I linger on the lips of men, and live. 30</p>
<p>Ennius succeeded in everything but comedy; perhaps he took philosophy
too seriously, forgetting his counsel that “one must philosophize, but
not too much .” 81 The people rightly preferred laug hter to philosophy,
and made Plautus rich and Ennius poor. For like reasons they gave little
en- couragement to the tragic drama in Rome. The tragedies of Pacuvius
and Accius were acclaimed by the aristocracy, ignored by the people, and
for- gotten by time.</p>
<p>In Rome, as in Athens, plays were presented to the public by state
officials as partial celebration of a religious festival or as the
obsequies of some distinguished citizen. The theater of Plautus and
Terence consisted of a wooden scaffolding supporting a decorated
background (the scaena), and, in front of this, a circular orchestra ,
or platform for dancing; the rear half of this circle formed the pros-
caenium, or stage. These flimsy structures were tom down after each
festival, like our reviewing stands today. The spectators stood, or sat
on stools they had brought, or squatted on the ground under the sky. Not
till 145 was a complete</p>
<p>CHAP, v) THE GREEK CONQUEST 99</p>
<p>theater built in Rome, still of wood and roofless, but fitted with
seats in the Greek semicircular style. No admission was charged; slaves
might attend, but not sit; women were admitted only in the rear. The
audience in this period was prob- ably the roughest and dullest in
dramatic history — a jostling, boisterous crowd of “groundlings”; it is
sad to note how often the prologues beg for quiet and better manners,
and how the crude jokes and stereotyped ideas must be repeated to be
understood. Some prologues ask mothers to leave their babies at home, or
threaten noisy children, or admonish women not to chatter so much; such
peti- tions occur even in the midst of the published plays . 32 If an
exhibition of prize fighting or rope walking happened to compete, the
play, as like as not, would be interrupted until the more exciting
performance was over. At the end of a Roman comedy the words, Nunc
plaudite omnes , or some variant, made plain that the play was finished
and that applause was in order.</p>
<p>The best feature of the Roman stage was the acting. The leading part
was usually played by the manager, a freeman; the other performers were
mostly Greek slaves. Any citizen who became an actor forfeited his civic
rights — a cus- tom that lasted till Voltaire. Female parts were taken
by men. As audiences were small, actors in this age did not wear masks,
but contented themselves with paint and wigs. About ioo b.c., as
audiences grew larger, the mask became necessary to distinguish the
characters; it was called persona , apparently from the Etruscan word
for mask, phersu; and the parts were called dramatis personae — masks of
the play. Tragedians wore a high shoe, or “buskin” ( cothurnus ),
comedians a low shoe, or “sock” ( soccus ). Parts of the play were sung
to the obbligato of a flute; sometimes singers sang the parts while
actors performed them in pantomime.</p>
<p>The Plautine comedies were written in rough and ready iambic verse,
imitating the meter as well as the matter of their Greek models. Most of
the Latin comedies that have come down to us were taken directly, or by
combination, from one or more Greek dramas; usually from Philemon,
Menander, or other practitioners of the New Comedy in Athens. The author
and title of the Greek original were usually named on the title page.
Adaptations of Aristophanes and the Old Comedy were ruled out by a law
of the Twelve Tables punishing political satire with death . 38 It was
probably fear of this lethal legislation that led the Latin playwrights
to keep the Greek scenes, characters, customs, names, even coins, of
their originals; but for Plautus Roman law would have banished Roman
life almost completely from the Roman stage. This police supervision did
not exclude coarseness and obscenity; the aedile wished to amuse the
crowd, not to elevate it; and the Roman government was never displeased
by the ignorance of the multi- tude. The audience preferred broad humor
to wit, buffoonery to subtlety, vul- garity to poetry, Plautus to
Terence.</p>
<p>T. Maccius Plautus — literally, Titus the flat-footed clown — had
made his first entrance in Umbria in 254. Coming to Rome, he worked as a
stage hand, saved his money, invested it eagerly, and lost it. To eat he
wrote plays; his adaptations from the Greek pleased by the Roman
allusions scattered</p>
<p>IOO</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>through them; he made money again and was given the citizenship of
Rome. He was a man of the people and the earth, exuberantly jolly,
Rabelaisianly robust; he laughed with everyone at everyone, but felt a
hearty good will toward all. He wrote or refurbished 130 plays, of which
twenty survive. The Miles Gloriosus is a jolly picture of a braggart
soldier, whose servant feeds him hopefully with lies:</p>
<p>Servant: You saw those girls who stopped me yesterday?</p>
<p>Captain: What did they say?</p>
<p>Servant: Why, when you passed, they asked me,</p>
<p>“What! is the great Achilles here?” I answered,</p>
<p>“No, it’s his brother.” Then says the other one,</p>
<p>“Troth, he is handsome! What a noble man!</p>
<p>What splendid hair!” . . . and begged me, both of them,</p>
<p>… To make you take a walk again today,</p>
<p>That they might get a better sight of you.</p>
<p>Captain: ’Tis a great nuisance being so very handsome! 84</p>
<p>The Amphitryon turns the laugh upon Jove, who, disguised as Alcmena’s
husband, calls upon himself to witness his own oath and offers pious
sacri- fice to Jupiter. 35 The day after he seduces the lady she bears
twins. At the end Plautus asks the god to forgive him and to take the
lion’s share of the applause. The story proved as popular in the Rome of
Plautus as in the Athens of Menander, the Paris of Moliere, or the New
York of our own time. The Aulularia is the tale of a miser’s hoard, told
with more sympathy than in Moliere’s Avare; the miser collects the
parings of his nails, and laments the wasted water in the tears he has
shed. The Menaechmi is the old story of twins and their climactic
recognition — a source for Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors. Lessing
thought the Captivi the best play ever staged; 86 Plautus, too, liked
it, and made its prologue say:</p>
<p>It is not hackneyed or just like the rest;</p>
<p>It has no filthy lines one must not quote,</p>
<p>No perjured pander, and no wicked wench.</p>
<p>It is true; but the plot is so intricate, so dependent upon
improbable coinci- dences and revelations, that a mind allergic to dead
history may be forgiven for passing it by. What made these comedies
succeed was not their ancient plots but their wealth of humorous
incident, their rollicking puns as bad as Shakespeare’s, their
boisterous indecency, their gallery of precipitate women, and their
occasional sentiment; in every play the audience could rely upon finding
a love affair, a seduction, a handsome and virtuous hero, and a slave
with more brains than all the rest of the characters put together. Here,
almost at its outset, Roman literature touches the common man, and
reaches, through</p>
<p>CHAP, v) THE GREEK CONQUEST</p>
<p>Greek disguises, to the realities of daily life as Latin poetry would
never do again.</p>
<p>Probably in the year of Plautus’ death (184), Publius Terentius Afer
wa s bom at Carthage of Phoenician, perhaps also of African, blood. We
know nothing more of him until he appears as the slave of Terentius
Lucanus in Rome. This senator recognized the shy lad’s talent, gave him
an education, and freed him; the youth in gr atitude took his master’s
name. We get a pleasant note of Roman manners when we hear how Terence,
“poor and meanly clad,” came to the house of Caecilius Statius— whose
comedies, now lost, were then dominating the Roman stage — and read him
the first scene of the Andria. Caecilius was so charmed that he invited
the poet to dinner and listened admiringly to the rest. 87 Terence soon
won a hearing from Aemilianus and Laelius, who sought to form his style
in the polished Latin so dear to their hearts. Hen ce gossip said that
Laelius was writing Terence’s plays — a report which the author, with
tact and prudence, neither confirmed nor denied. 38 Moved perhaps by the
respectful Hellenism of the Scipionic circle, Terence adhered faithfully
to his Greek originals, gave his plays Greek titles, avoided allusions
to Roman life, and called himself merely a translator 39 — a modest
understatement of his work.</p>
<p>We do not know the fate of the play that Caecilius liked so well. The
Hecyra, which Terence wrote next, failed because its audience slipped
away to watch a bear fight. Fortune smiled in 162 when he produced his
most famous play — the Heanton Ttmoroumenos, or “Self - Tormentor.” It
told the story of a father who had forbidden his son to marry the girl
of his choice; the son married her nevertheless; the father disowned and
banished him, and then, in self-punishing remorse, refused to touch his
wealth, but lived in hard labor and poverty. A neighbor proposes to
mediate; the father asks why he takes so kindly an interest in the
troubles of others; and the neighbor replies in a world-renowned line
which all the audience applauded:</p>
<p>Homo sum ; humani nihil a me alienum puto —</p>
<p>“I am a man; I consider nothing human alien to me.” In the following
year The Eunuch was so well received that it was performed twice in the
same day (then a rare event) , and earned Terence 8000 sesterces ($ 1
200) between morning and night. 40 A few months later appeared the
Phormio, named from the witty servant who saved his master from paternal
ire, and became the model for Beaumarchais’ lusty Figaro. In 160
Terence’s last play, the Adelphi, or “Brothers,” was performed at the
funeral games of Aemilius Paulus. Soon afterward the playwright sailed
for Greece. On the way back he died of illness in Arcadia, in his
twenty-fifth year.</p>
<p>His later plays had suffered in popularity because Hellenism had won
in</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>him too full a victory. He lacked the vivacity and abounding humor of
Plautus; he never thought to deal with Roman life. There were no lusty
villains in his comedies, no reckless strumpets; all his feminine
characters were handled with tenderness, and even his prostitutes
hovered on the brink of virtue. There were fine pithy lines and
memorable phrases: hinc illae lacrimae (“hence those tears”), fortes
fortuna adiuvat (“fortune favors the brave”), quot homines tot
sententiae (“as many opinions as men”), and a hundred more; but they
required for their appreciation a philosophical intel- ligence or
literary sensitivity which the African slave found wanting in the Roman
plebs. It did not care for his comedies that were half tragedies, his
well-built but slowly moving plots, his subtle studies of strange
characters, his quiet dialogue and too even style, and the almost
insulting purity of his language; it was as if the audience felt that a
breach, never to be healed, had been opened between the people and the
literature of Rome. Cicero, too near to Catullus to see him, and too
prudent to relish Lucretius, thought Terence the finest poet of the
Republic. Caesar estimated him more justly when he praised the “lover of
pure speech,” but deplored the lack of vis comica — the power of
laughter — in Terence, and called him dhmdiatus Menander — ’half a
Menander.” One thing, nevertheless, Terence had achieved: this Semitic
alien, inspired by Laelius and Greece, had molded the Latin language at
last into a literary instrument that would in the next century make
possible the prose of Cic ero, and Virgil’s poetry.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CATO AND THE CONSERVATIVE OPPOSITION</li>
</ol>
<p>This Greek invasion, in literature, philosophy, religion, science,
and art, this revolution in manners, morals, and blood, filled
old-fashioned Romans with disgust and dread. Out on a Sabine farm a
retired senator, Valerius Flaccus, fretted over the decay of the Roman
character, the corruption of politics, the replacement of the mos
maiorum with Greek ideas and ways. He was too old to fight the tide
himself. But on a near-by homestead, just outside Reate, was a young
plebeian peasant who showed all the old Roman qualities, loved the soil,
worked hard, saved carefully, lived with conserva- tive simplicity, and
yet talked as brilliantly as a radical. He bore the names Marcus Porcius
Cato: Porcius because his family had for generations raised pigs; Cato
because they had been shrewd. Flaccus encouraged him to study law; Cato
did, and won his neighbors’ cases in the local courts. Flaccus advised
him to go to Rome; Cato went, and by the age of thirty obtained the
quaestorship (204) . By 199 he was aedile, by 198 praetor, by 195
consul; in 19 1 tribune, in 184 censor. Meanwhile he served twenty-six
years in the</p>
<p>CHAP. V) THE GREEK CONQUEST 103</p>
<p>army as a fearless soldier and an able and ruthless general. He
considered discipline the mother of character and freedom; he despised a
soldier “who plied his hands in marching and his feet in fighting, and
whose snore was louder than his battle cry”; but he won the respect of
his troo ps by marching beside them on foot, giving each of them a pound
of silver from the spoils, and keeping nothing for himself . 41</p>
<p>In the intervals of peace he denounced rhetors and rhetoric, and
became the most powerful orator of his time. The Romans listened in
reluctant fascination, for no one had ever spoken to them with such
obvious honesty and stinging wit; the lash of his tongue might fall upon
any man present, but it was pleasant to see it descend upon one’s
neighbor. Cato fought cor - ruption recklessly, and seldom let the sun
set without having made new enemies. Few loved him, for his scar-covered
face and wild red hair dis- concerted them, his big teeth threatened
them, his asceticism shamed them, his industry left them lagging, his
green eyes looked through their words into their selfishness. Forty-four
times his patrician enemies tried to destroy him by public indictments;
forty-four times he was saved by the votes of farmers who, like him,
resented venality and luxury . 42 When their votes made him censor, all
Rome shuddered. He carried out the threats with which he had won the
campaign; laid heavy taxes upon luxuries, fined a senator for
extravagance, and excluded from the Senate six members in whose record
he found malfeasance. He expelled Manilius for kissing his wife in
public; as for himself, he said, he never embraced his wife except when
it thundered — though he was glad when it thundered. He completed the
drainage system of the city, cut the pipes that had clandestinely tapped
water from the public aqueducts or conduits, compelled owners to
demolish the illegal projections of their buildings upon or over the
public right of way, forced down the price paid by the state for public
works, and frightened the tax collectors into remitting a larger share
of their receipts to the Treas- ury . 48 After five years of heroic
opposition to the nature of man, he retired from office, made successful
investments, manned his now vast farm with slaves, lent money at
usurious rates, bought slaves cheap and — after training them in some
skill — sold them dear, and became so rich that he could afford to write
books — an occupation he despised.</p>
<p>Cato was the first great writer of Latin prose. He began by
publishing his own speeches. Then he issued a manual of oratory,
demanded a rugged Roman style instead of the Isocratean smoothness of
the rhetors, and set a theme for Quintilian by defining the orator as
vir bonus dicendi peritus ’“—“a good man skilled in speaking” (but was
there ever union so rare?). He put his farming experiences to use by
composing a treatise De agri cultura — the</p>
<p>104 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. V</p>
<p>only work of Cato, and the oldest literary Latin, that time has
saved. It is written in a simple and vigorous style, pithily compact;
Cato wastes no words, and seldom condescends to a conjunction. He gives
detailed advice on buying and selling slaves (old ones should be sold
before they become a loss), on renting land to share-croppers, on
viticulture and aboriculture, on domestic management and industries, on
making cement and cooking dainties, on curing constipation and diarrhea,
on healing snakebite with the dung of swine, and offering sacrifice to
the gods. Asking himself what is the wisest use of agricultural land, he
answers, “Profitable cattle raising.” The next best? “Moderately
profitable cattle raising.” The third best? “Very unprofitable cattle
raising.” The fourth? “To plow the land.” This was the argument that
gave the latifundia to Italy.</p>
<p>The most important of his books was probably the lost Origines, a
brave attempt to deal with the antiquities, ethnology, institutions, and
history of Italy from the beginnings to the very year of Cato’s death.
Nearly all that</p>
<p>The Greeks 〔he wrote to his son〕 are an intractable and
iniquitous</p>
<p>race. You may take my word for it that when this people bestows its
literature upon Rome it will ruin everything. . . . And all the
sooner</p>
<p>if it sends us its physicians. They have conspired among
themselves</p>
<p>to murder all “barbarians.” … I forbid you to have anything to do</p>
<p>with physicians . 47</p>
<p>Having these ideas, he was a natural antagonist of the Scipionic
circle, which thought the spread of Greek literature in Rome a necessary
ferment in lifting Larin letters and the Roman mind to a fuller growth.
Cato lent his aid to the prosecution of Africanus and his brother; the
laws against embez-</p>

<p>105</p>
<p>zlement should be no respecters of persons. Toward foreign states,
with one exception, he advocated a policy of justice and
nonintervention. Despising Greeks, he respected Greece; and when the
imperialistic plunderers in the Senate were for waging war upon rich
Rhodes, he made-a decisive speech in favor of conciliation. The
exception, as all the world knows, was Carthage. Sent there on an
official mission in 175, he had been shocked by the rapid recovery of
the city from the effects of the Hannibalic war, the fruitful orchards
and vineyards, the wealth that poured in from revived commerce, the arms
that mounted in the arsenals. On his return he held up before the Senate
a bundle of fresh figs that he had plucked in Carthage three days
before, as an ominous symbol of her prosperity and her nearness to Rome;
and he predicted that if Carthage were left unchecked, she would soon be
rich and strong enough to renew the struggle for the mastery of the
Medi- terranean. From that day, with characteristic pertinacity, he
ended all his speeches in the Senate, on whatever subject, with his dour
conviction: Ceterum censeo delendam esse Carthaginem — ’ Besides, I
think that Carthage must be destroyed.” The imperialists in the Senate
agreed with him, not so much because they coveted Ca rthage’s trade, as
because they saw in the well-irrigated fields of north Africa a new
investment for their money, new latifundia to be tilled by new slaves.
They awaited eagerly a pretext for the Third Punic War.</p>
<p>vn. CARTHAGO DELETA</p>
<p>Their cue came from the most extraordinary ruler of his time.
Masinissa, King of Numidia, lived ninety years (238-148), begot a son at
eighty-six, 48 and by a vigorous regimen kept his health and strength
almost to the end. He organized his nomad people into a settled
agricultural society and a disciplined state, ruled them ably for sixty
years, adorned Cirta, his capital, with lordly architecture, and left as
his tomb the great pyramid that still stands near the town of
Constantine, in Tunisia. Having won the friendship of Rome, and knowing
the political weakness of Carthage, he repeatedly raided and
appropriated Carthaginian terrain, took Great Leptis and other cities,
and finally controlled all land approaches to the harassed metropolis.
Bound by treaty to ma ke no war without Rome’s consent, Carthage sent
ambassadors to the Senate to protest against Masinissa’s encroachments.
The Senate reminded them that all Phoenicians were interlopers in Africa
and had no rights there which any well-armed nation was obliged to
respect. When Carthage paid the last of her fifty annual indemnities of
200 talents to Rome, she felt herself released from the treaty signed
after Zama. In 15 1 she</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>declared war against Numidia, and a year later Rome declared war
against her.</p>
<p>The latter declaration, and the news that the Roman fleet had already
sailed for Africa, reached Carthage at the same time. The ancient city,
how- ever rich in population and trade, was quite unprepared for a major
war. She had a small army, a smaller navy, no mercenaries, no allies.
Rome con- trolled the sea. Utica therefore declared for Rome, and
Masinissa blocked all egress from Carthage to the hinterland. An embassy
hastened to Rome with authority to meet all demands. The Senate promised
that if Carthage would turn over to the Roman consuls in Sicily 300
children of the noblest families as hostages, and would obey whatever
orders the consuls would give, the freedom and territorial integrity of
Carthage would be preserved. Secretly the Senate bade the consuls carry
out the instructions that they had already received. The Carthaginians
gave up their children with fore- bodings and laments; the relatives
crowded the shores in a despondent farewell; at the last moment the
mothers tried by force to prevent the ships from sailing; and some swam
out to sea to catch a last glimpse of their children. The consuls sent
the hostages to Rome, crossed to Utica with army and fleet, summoned the
Carthaginian ambassadors, and required of Carthage the surrender of her
remaining ships, a great quantity of grain, and all her engines and
weapons of war. When these conditions had been fulfilled, the consuls
further demanded that the population of Carthage should retire to ten
miles from the city, which was then to be burned to the ground. The
ambassadors argued in vain that the destruction of a city which had
surrendered hostages and its arms without striking a blow was a
treacherous atrocity unknown to history. They offered their own lives as
a vicarious atonement; they flung themselves upon the ground and beat
the earth with their heads. The consuls replied that the terms were
those of the Senate and could not be changed.</p>
<p>When the people of Carthage heard what was demanded of them they lost
their sanity. Parents mad with grief tore limb from limb the leaders who
had advised surrendering the child hostages; others killed those who had
counseled the surrender of arms; some dragged the returning ambas-
sadors through the streets and stoned them; some killed whatever
Italians could be found in the city; some stood in the empty arsenals
and wept. The Carthaginian Senate declared war against Rome and called
all adults — men and women, slave or free — to form a new army, and to
forge anew the weapons of defense. Fury gave them resolution. Public
buildings were demolished to provide metal and timber; the statues of
cherished gods were melted down to make swords, and the hair of the
women was shorn to make ropes. In two months the beleaguered city
produced 8000 shields,</p>
<p>CHAP, v) THE GREEK CONQUEST 107</p>
<p>18.000 swords, 30,000 spears, 60,000 catapult missiles, and built in
its inner harbor a fleet of 1 20 ships. 49</p>
<p>Three years the city stood siege by land and sea. Again and again the
consuls led their armies against the walls, but always they were
repulsed; only Scipio Aemilianus, one of the military tribunes, proved
resourceful and brave. Late in 147 the Roman Senate and Assembly made
him consul and commander, and all men approved. Soon afterward Laelius
succeeded in scaling the walls. The Carthaginians, though weakened and
decimated by starvation, fought for their city street by street, through
six days of slaughter without quarter. Harassed by snipers, Scipio
ordered all captured streets to be fired and leveled to the ground.
Hundreds of concealed Cartha- ginians perished in the conflagration. At
last the population, reduced from</p>
<p>500.000 to 55,000, surrendered. Hasdrubal, their general, pleaded for
his life, which Scipio granted, but his wife, denouncing his cowardice,
plunged with her sons into the flames. The survivors were sold as
slaves, and the city was turned over to the legions for pillage.
Reluctant to raze it, Scipio sent to Rome for final instructions; the
Senate replied that not only Carthage, but all such of her dependencies
as had stood by her were to be completely destroyed, that the soil
should be plowed and sown with salt, and a formal curse laid upon any
man who should attempt to build upon the site. For seventeen days the
city burned.</p>
<p>There was no treaty of peace, for the Carthaginian state no longer
existed. Utica and other African cities that had helped Rome were left
free under a protectorate; the remainder of Cartha ge’s territory became
the province of “Africa.” Roman capitalists came in to divide the land
into latifundia, and Roman merchants fell heir to Carthaginian trade.
Imperialism became now the frank and conscious motive of Roman politics.
Syracuse was absorbed into the province of Sicily, southern Gaul was
subdued as a neces- sary land route to completely subjected Spain, and
the Hellenistic mon- archies of Egypt and Syria were quietly induced —
like Antiochus IV by Popilius — to submit to the wishes of Rome. From
the moral standpoint, which is always a window dressing in international
politics, the destruction of Carthage and Corinth in 146 must rank among
the most brutal conquests in history; from the standpoint of empire — of
security and wealth — it laid simultaneously the two cornerstones of
Rome’s commercial and naval supremacy. From that moment the political
history of the Mediterranean flowed through Rome.</p>
<p>In the midst of the war its chief instigators had died in the
fullness of victory — Cato in 149, Masinissa in 148. The old censor had
left a deep mark upon Roman history. Men would look back to him for many
centuries as</p>
<p>io8</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>the typical Roman of the Republic: Cicero would idealize him in De
Senec- tute; his great-great-grandson would reincarnate his philosophy
without his humor; Marcus Aurelius would mold himself upon his example;
Fronto would call upon Latin literature to return to the simplicity and
directness of his style. Nevertheless, the destruction of Carthage was
his only success. His war against Hellenism completely failed; every
department of Roman letters, philosophy, oratory, science, art,
religion, morals, manners, and dress surrendered to Greek influence. He
hated Greek philosophers; his famous descendant would surround himself
with them. The religious faith that he had lost continued to decline
despite his efforts to reanimate it. Above all, the political corruption
that he had fought in his youth grew wider and deeper as the stak es of
ofKce rose with the Empire’s spread; every new conquest made Rome
richer, more rotten, more merciless. She had won every war but the class
war; and the destruction of Carthage removed the last check to civil
division and strife. Now through a hundred bitter years of revolution
Rome would pay the penalty of gaining the world.</p>
