<h4 id="chapter-xii-thought-and-art-in-eastern-islam">CHAPTER XII
Thought and Art in Eastern Islam</h4>
<p>632-1058</p>
<p>I. SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>I F we may believe the traditions, Mohammed, unlike most religious
re- formers, admired and urged the pursuit of knowledge: “He who leaves
his home in search of knowledge walks in the path of God… and the ink of
the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr”; 1 but these
traditions have the ring of pedagogic narcissism. In any case the
contact of the Arabs with Greek culture in Syria awoke in them an eager
emulation; and soon the scholar as well as the poet was honored in
Islam.</p>
<p>Education began as soon as the child could speak; it was at once
taught to say, “I testify that there is no God but Allah, and I testify
that Mohammed is His prophet.” At the age of six some slave children,
some girls, and nearly all boys except the rich (who had private tutors)
entered an elementary school, usually in a mosque, sometimes near a
public fountain in the open air. Tuition was normally free, or so low as
to be within general reach; the teacher received from tbe parent some
two cents per pupil per week ; 2 the remaining cost was borne by
philanthropists. The curriculum was simple: the necessary prayers of
Moslem worship, enough reading to decipher the Koran, and, for the rest,
the Koran itself as theology, history, ethics, and law. Writing and
arithmetic were left to higher education, perhaps because writing, in
tbe Orient, was an art that required specific training; besides, said
the Moslem, scribes would be available for those who insisted on
writing. 8 Each day a part of the Koran was memorized and recited aloud;
the goal set before every pupil was to learn the entire book by heart.
He who succeeded was called hafiz, “holder,” an d was publicly
celebrated. He who also learned writing, archery, and swimming was
called al- kamil, “the perfect one.” The method was memory, the
discipline was the rod; the usual punishment was a beating with a palm
stick on the soles of the feet. Said Harun to the tutor of his son Amin:
“Be not strict to the extent of stifling his faculties, nor lenient to
the point of… accustoming him to idleness. Straighten him as much as
thou canst through kindness and gentleness, but fail not to resort to f
orce and severity should he not respond.” 4</p>
<p>Elementary education aimed to form character, secondary education to
transmit knowledge. Squatting against a mosque pillar or wall,
scholars</p>
<p>2 35</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>offered instruction in Koranic interpretation, Hadith, theology, and
law. At an unknown date many of these informal secondary schools were
brought under governmental regulation and subsidy as madrasas or
colleges. To the basic theological curriculum they added grammar,
philology, rhetoric, liter- ature, logic, mathematics, and astronomy.
Grammar was emphasized, for Arabic was considered the most nearly
perfect of all languages, and its cor- rect use was the chief mark of a
gentleman. Tuition in these colleges was free, and in some cases
government or philanthropy paid both the salaries of the professors and
the expenses of the students. 5 The teacher counted for more than the
text, except in the case of the Koran; boys studied men rather than
books; and students would travel from one end of the Moslem world to
another to meet the mind of a famous teacher. Every scholar who desired
a high standing at home had to hear the master scholars of Mecca,
Baghdad, Damascus, and Cairo. This international of letters was made
easier by the fact that throughout Islam — through whatever diversity of
peoples — the lan- guage of learning and literature was Arabic; Latin
had no wider realm. When a visitor entered a Moslem city he took it for
granted that he could hear a scholarly lecture at the principal mosque
at almost any hour of the day. In many cases the wandering scholar
received not only free instruction at the madrasa, but, for a time, free
lodging and food. 6 No degrees were given; what the student sought was a
certificate of approval from the individual teacher. The final accolade
was the acquirement of adab — the manners and tastes, the verbal wit and
grace, the lightly carried knowledge, of a gentle- man.</p>
<p>When the Moslems captured Samarkand (712) they learned from the Chi-
nese the technique of beating flax and other fibrous plants into a pulp,
and drying the pulp in thin sheets. Introduced to the Near East as a
substitute for parchment and leather at a time when papyrus was not yet
forgotten, the product received the name papyros — paper. The first
paper-manufacturing plant in Islam was opened at Baghdad in 794 by al-
Fadl, son of Harun’s vizier. The craft was brought by the Arabs to
Sicily and Spain, and thence passed into Italy and France. We find paper
in use in China as early as a.d. 105, in Mecca in 707, in Egypt in 800,
in Spain in 950, in Constantinople in 1 100, in Sicily in 1 102, in
Italy in 1 1 54, in Germany in 1228, in England in 1 309. 7 The
invention facilitated the making of books wherever it went. Yaqubi tells
us that in his time (891) Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers. Their
shops were also centers of copying, calligraphy, and literary
gatherings. Many students made a living by copying manuscripts and
selling the copies to book dealers. In the tenth century we hear of
autograph hunters, and of book collectors who paid great sums for rare
manuscripts. 8 Authors received nothing from the sale of their books;
they depended on some less speculative mode of subsistence, or upon the
patronage of princes or rich men. Liter-</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 237</p>
<p>ature was written, and art was designed, in Islam, to meet the taste
of an aristocracy of money or of blood.</p>
<p>Most mosques had libraries, and some cities had public libraries of
consid- erable content and generous accessibility. About 950 Mosul had a
library, established by private philanthropy, where students were
supplied with paper as well as books. Ten large catalogues were required
to list the vol- ume s in the public library at Rayy. Basra’s library
gave stipends to scholars working in it. The geographer Yaqut spent
three years in the libraries of Merv and Khwarizm, gathering data for
his geographical dictionary. When Baghdad was destroyed by the Mongols
it had thirty-six public libraries. 9 Private libraries were numberless;
it was a fashion among the rich to have an ample collection of books. A
physician refused the invitation of the sultan of Bokhara to come and
live at his court, on the ground that he would need 400 camels to
transport his library. 10 Al-Waqidi, dying, left 600 boxes of books,
each box so heavy that two men were needed to carry it; 11 “princes like
Sahib ibn Abbas in the tenth century might own as many books as could
then be found in all the libraries of Europe combined.” 12 Nowhere else
in those eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of our era was
there so great a passion for books, unless it was in the China of Ming
Huang. Islam reached then the summit of its cultural life. In a thousand
mosques from Cordova to Samarkand scholars were as numerous as pillars,
and made the cloisters tremble with their eloquence; the roads of the
realm were disturbed by innumerable geographers, historians, and
theologians seeking knowledge and wisdom; the courts of a hundred
princes resounded with poetry and philosophical debate; and no man dared
be a millionaire without supporting literature or art. The old cultures
of the conquered were eagerly absorbed by the quick-witted Arabs; and
the conquerors showed such tolerance that of the poets, scientists, and
philosophers who now made Arabic the most learned and literary tongue in
the world only a small minority were of Arab blood.</p>
<p>The scholars of Islam in this period strengthened the foundations of
a distinguished literature by their labors in grammar, which gave the
Arabic tongue logic and standards; by their dictionaries, which gathered
the word wealth of that language into precision and order; by their
anthologies, ency- clopedias, and epitomes, which preserved much that
was otherwise lost; and by their work in textual, literary, and
historical criticism. We gratefully omit their names, and salute their
achievement.</p>
<p>Those whom we remember best among the scholars are the historians,
for to them we owe our knowledge of a civilization that without them
would be as unknown to us as Pharaonic Egypt before Champollion.
Muhammad ibn Ishaq (d. 767) wrote a classical Life of Mohammed-, as
revised and enlarged by Ibn Hisham (763) it is — barring the Koran — the
oldest significant Arabic prose work</p>
<p>238 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XII</p>
<p>hat has reached 11s. Curious and tireless scholars composed
biographical diction- aries of saints, or philosophers, or viziers, or
jurists, or physicians, or calligraphers, or mandarins, or lovers, or
scholars. Ibn Qutaiba (828-89) was one of many Moslems who attempted to
write a history of the world; and unlike most histo- rians he had the
courage to set his own religion in that modest perspective which every
nation or faith must bear in time’s immensity. Muhammad al -Nadim pro-
duced in 987 an Index of the Sciences ( Fihrist al-ulum ), a
bibliography of all books in Arabic, original or translated, on any
branch of knowledge, with a bio- graphical and critical notice of each
author, including a list of his virtues and vices; we may estimate the
wealth of Moslem literature in his time by noting that not one in a
thousand of the volumes that he named is known to exist today. 13</p>
<p>The Livy of Islam 14 was Abu Jafar Muhammad al-Tabari (838-923). Like
so many Moslem writers, he was a Persian, born in Tabaristan, south of
the Caspian Sea. After several years spent as a poor wandering scholar
in Arabia, Syria, and Egypt, he settled down as a jurist in Baghdad. For
forty years he de- voted himself to composing an enormous universal
chronicle — Annals of the Apostles and Kings (Kitab akhbar al-Rusul
wal-Muluk ) — from the creation to</p>
<ol start="913" type="1">
<li>What survives fills fifteen large volumes; we are told that the
original was ten times as long. Like Bossuet, al-Tabari saw the hand of
God in every event, and filled his early chapters with pious nonsense:
God “created men to test them”; 15 God dropped upon the earth a house
built of rubies for Adam’s dwell - ing, but when Adam sinned God drew it
up again. 16 Al-Tabari followed the Bible in giving the history of the
Jews; accepted the Virgin Birth of Christ (Mary conceived Jesus because
Gabriel blew into her sleeve) , 17 and ended Part One with Jesus’ asce
nsion into heaven. Part Two is a far more creditable performance, and
gives a sober, occasionally vivid, history of Sasanian Persia. The
method is chron- ological, describing events year by year, and usually
traditional — tracing the narratives through one or more chains of
Hadith to an eyewitness or contempo- rary of the incident. The method
has the virtue of stating sources carefully; but as al-Tabari makes no
attempt to co-ordinate the diverse traditions into a sus- tained and
united narrative his history remains a mountain of industry rather than
a work of art.</li>
</ol>
<p>Al-Masudi, al- Tabari’s greatest successor, ranked him as al -
Masudi’s greatest predecessor. Abu-l-Hasan Ali al-Masudi, an Arab of
Baghdad, traveled through Syria, Palestine, Arabia, Zanzibar, Persia,
Central Asia, India, and Ceylon; he claims even to have reached the
China Sea. He gathered his gleanings into a thirty-volume encyclopedia,
which proved too long for even the spacious schol- ars of Islam; he
published a compendium, also gigantic; finally (947) — perhaps realizing
that his readers had less time to read than he had to write — he reduced
his work to the form in which it survives, and gave it the fancy title,
Meadows of Gold and Mines of Precious Stones. Al-Masudi surveyed
omnivorously the geog- raphy, biology, history, customs, religion,
science, philosophy, and literature of all lands from China to France;
he was the Pliny as well as the Herodotus of the Moslem world. He did
not compress his material to aridity, but wrote at times with a genial
leisureliness that did not shun, now and then, an amusing tale. He was a
bit skeptical in religion, but never forced his doubts upon his
audience. In</p>
<p>CHAP.XII) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 239</p>
<p>he last year of his life he summarized his views on science, history,
and philos- ophy in a Book of Information , in which he suggested an
evolution “from min - eral to plant, from plant to animal, and from
animal to man.” 18 Perhaps these views embroiled him with the
conservatives of Baghdad; he was forced, he says, “to leave the city
where I was born and grew up.” He moved to Cairo, but mourned the
separation. “It is the character of our time,” he wrote, “to
separate</p>
<p>At their best these historians excel in the scope of their enterprise
and their interests; they properly combine geography and history, and
nothing human is alien to them; and they are far superior to the
contemporary historians in Christendom. Even so they lose themselves too
long in politics and war and wordy rhetoric; they seldom seek the
economic, social, and psychological causes of events; we miss in their
vast volumes a sense of orderly synthesis, and find merely a congeries
of unco-ordinated parts — nations, episodes, and personalities. They
rarely rise to a conscientious scrutiny of sources, and rely too piously
upon chains of tradition in which every link is a possible error or
deceit; in consequence their narratives sometimes degenerate into
childish tales of portent, miracle, and myth. As many Christian
historians (always excepting Gibbon) can write medieval histories in
which all Islamic civilization is a brief appendage to the Crusades, so
many Moslem historians reduced world history before Islam to a halting
prepara- tion for Mohammed. But how can a Western mind ever judge an
Oriental justly? The beauty of the Arab language fades in translation
like a flower cut from its roots; and the topics that fill the pages of
Moslem historians, fascinating to their countrymen, seem aridly remote
from the natural interests of Occidental readers, who have not realized
how the economic interdependence of peoples ominously demands a mutual
study and understanding of East and West.</p>

<li>SCIENCE w</li>
</ol>
<p>In those lusty centuries of Islamic life the Moslems labored for such
an understanding. The caliphs realized the backwardness of the Arabs in
science and philosophy, and the wealth of Greek culture surviving in
Syria. The Umayyads wisely left unhindered the Christian, Sabaean, or
Persian colleges at Alexandria, Beirut, Antioch, Harran, Nisibis, and
Jund-i-Shapur; and in those schools the classics of Greek science and
philosophy were pre- served, often in Syriac translations. Moslems
learning Syriac or Greek were intrigued by these treatises; and soon
translations were made into Arabic by</p>

<li>Every writer on Islamic science must record his debt to George
Sarton for his Introduc- tion to the History of Science. That monumental
work is not only one of the noblest achieve- ments in the history of
scholarship; it also performs an inestimable service in revealing the
wealth and scope of Moslem culture. Scholars everywhere must hope that
every facility will be provided for the completion of this work.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Nestorian Christians or Jews. Umayyad and Abbasid princes stimulated
this fruitful borrowing. Al-Mansur, al-Mamun, and al-Mutawakkil
dispatched messengers to Constantinople and other Hellenistic cities —
sometimes to their traditional enemies the Greek emperors — asking for
Greek books, especially in medicine or mathematics; in this way Euclid’s
Elements came to Islam. In 830 al-Mamun established at Baghdad, at a
cost of 200,000 dinars (50,000), a “House of Wisdom” ( Bayt al-Hikmah)
as a scientific academy, an observ- atory, and a public library; here he
installed a corps of translators, and paid them from the public
treasury. To the work of this institution, thought Ibn Khaldun, 20 Islam
owed that vibrant awakening which in causes — the exten- sion of
commerce and the rediscovery of Greece — and results — the flowering of
science, literature, and art — resembled the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>From 750 to 900 this fertilizing process of translation continued,
from Syriac, Greek, Pahlavi, and Sanskrit. At the head of the
translators in the House of Wisdom was a Nestorian physician, Hunain ibn
Ishaq (809-73) — i.e., John son of Isaac. By his own account he
translated a hundred treatises of Galen and the Galenic school into
Syriac, and thirty-nine into Arabic; through his renderings some
important works of Galen escaped destruction. Further, Hunain translated
Aristotle’s Categories , Physics , and Magna Moralia ; Plato’s Republic
, Timaeus , and Laws - , Hippocrates’ Aph orisms , Dioscorides’ Materia
Medic a, Ptolemy’s Quadripartitum , and the Old Testa - ment from the
Septuagint Greek. Al-Mamun endangered the treasury by paying Hunain in
gold the weight of the books he had translated. Al- Mutawakkil made him
court physician, but jailed him for a year when Hunain, though
threatened with death, refused to concoct a poison for an enemy. His son
Ishaq ibn Hunain helped him with his translations, and him- self
rendered into Arabic the Metaphysics , On the Soul , and On the Gener-
ation and Corruption of Animals of Aristotle, and the commentaries of
Alexander of Aphrodisias — a work fated to wield great influence on
Moslem philosophy.</p>
<p>By 850 most of the classic Greek texts in mathematics, astronomy, and
medicine had been translated. It was through its Arabic version that
Ptol- emy’s Almagest received its name; and only Arabic versions
preserved Books V-VII of the Conics of Apollonius of Perga, the
Mechanics of Hero of</p>
<p>Alexandria, and the Pneumatics of Philo of Byzantium. Strange to say,
the Mohammedans, so addicted to poetry and history, ignored Greek
poetry, drama, and historiography; here Islam accepted the lead of
Persia instead of Greece. It was the misfortune of Islam and humanity
that Plato, and even Aristotle, came into Moslem ken chiefly in
Neoplatonic form: Plato in Por- phyry’s interpretation, and Aristotle
discolored by an apocryphal Theol - ogy of Aristotle written by a
Neoplatonist of the fifth or sixth century, and translated into Arabic
as a genuine product of the Stagirite. The works of Plato and Aristotle
were almost completely translated, though with many</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 241</p>
<p>inaccuracies; but as the Moslem scholars sought to reconcile Greek
philoso- phy with the Koran, they took more readily to Neoplatonist
interpretations of them than to the original books themselves. The real
Aristotle reached Islam only in his logic and his science.</p>
<p>The continuity of science and philosophy from Egypt, India, and Baby-
lonia through Greece and Byzantium to Eastern and Spanish Islam, and
thence to northern Europe and America, is one of the brightest threads
in the skein of history. Greek science, though long since enfeebled by
ob- scurantism, misgovernment, and poverty, was still alive in Syria
when the Moslems came; at the very time of the conquest Severus Sebokht,
abbot of Ken-nesre on the upper Euphrates, was writing Greek treatises
on astron- omy, and was making the first known mention of Hindu numerals
outside of India (662). The Arabic inheritance of science was
overwhelmingly Greek, but Hindu influences ranked next. In 773, at al-
Mansur’s behest, translations were made of the Siddhantas — Indian
astronomical treatises dating as far back as 425 b.c.; these versions
may have been the vehicle through which the “Arabic” numerals and the
zero were brought from India into Islam. 21 In 8 1 3 al-Khwarizmi used
the Hindu numerals in his astronom- ical tables; about 825 he issued a
treatise known in its Latin form as Algoritmi de numero Indorum — “al -
Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians”; in tiihe algorithm or
algorism came to mean any arithmetical system based on the decimal
notation. In 976 Muhammad ibn Ahmad, in his Keys of the Sci- ences ,
remarked that if, in a calculation, no number appears in the place of
tens, a little circle should be used “to keep the rows.” 22 This circle
the</p>
<p>Algebra, which we find in the Greek Diophantes in the third century,
owes its name to the Arabs, who extensively developed this detective
science. The great figure here — perhaps the greatest in medieval
mathematics — was Muhammad ibn Musa (780-850), called al-Khwarizmi from
his birthplace Khwarizm (now Khiva), east of the Caspian Sea.
Al-Khwarizmi contributed effectively to five sciences: he wrote on the
Hindu numerals; compiled as- tronomical tables which, as revised in
Moslem Spain, were for centuries standard among astronomers from Cordova
to Chang-an; formulated the oldest trigonometrical tables known;
collaborated with sixty-nine other scholars in drawing up for al-Mamun a
geographical encyclopedia; and in his Calculation of Integration and
Equation gave analytical and geometrical solutions of quadratic
equations. This work, now lost in its Arabic form, was translated by
Gerard of Cremona in the twelfth century, was used as a prin- cipal text
in European universities until the sixteenth century, and intro- duced
to the West the word algebra (al-jabr — “restitution,” “comple - tion”).

<p>Moslem geometers. Abu Abdallah al-Battani (850-929), a Sabaean of
Raqqa known to Europe as Albategnus, advanced trigonometry far beyond
its be- ginnings in Hipparchus and Ptolemy by substituting triangular
for Ptolemy’s qua drilateral solutions, and the sine for Hipparchus’
chord -, he formulated the trigonometrical ratios essentially as we use
them today.</p>
<p>The Caliph al-Mamun engaged a staff of astronomers to make
observations and records, to test the findings of Ptolemy, and to study
the spots on the sun. Taking for granted the sphericity of the earth,
they measured a terres- trial degree by simultaneously taking the
position of the sun from both Palmyra and the plain of Sinjar; their
measurement gave 563 miles — half a mile more than our present
calculation; and from their results they estimated the earth’s
circumference to approximate 20,000 miles. These astronomers proceeded
on completely scientific principles: they accepted nothing as true which
was not confirmed by experience or experiment. One of them, Abu’l -
Farghani, of Transoxiana, wrote ( c. 860) an astronomical text which re-
mained in authority in Europe and Western Asia for 700 years. Even more
renowned was al-Battani; his astronomical observations, continued for
forty- one years, were remarkable for their range and accuracy; he
determined many astronomical coefficients with remarkable approximation
to modern calculations — the precession of the equinoxes at 54.5“ a
year, and the inclina- tion of the ecliptic at 23 0 55’. 23 Working
under the patronage of the early Buwayhid rulers of Baghdad, Abu’l -Wafa
(in the disputed opinion of Sadil- lot) discovered the third lunar
variation 600 years before Tycho Brahe. 24 Costly instruments were built
for the Moslem astronomers: not only astro- labes and armillary spheres,
known to the Greeks, but quadrants with a radius of thirty feet, and
sextants with a radius of eighty. The astrolabe, much improved by the
Moslems, reached Europe in the tenth century, and was widely used by
mariners till the seventeenth. The Arabs designed and constructed it
with aesthetic passion, making it at once an instrument of science and a
work of art.</p>
<p>Even more important than the charting of the skies was the mapping of
the earth, for Islam lived by tillage and trade. Suleiman al-Tajir —
i.e., the merchant — about 840 carried his wares to the Far East; an
anonymous author (85 1 ) wrote a narrative of Suleiman’s journey; this
oldest Arabic account of China antedated Marco Pol o’s T ravels by 42 5
years. In the same century Ibn Khordadhbeh wrote a description of India,
Ceylon, the East Indies, and China, apparently from direct observation;
and Ibn Hauqal described India and Africa. Ahmad al-Yaqubi, of Armenia
and Khurasan, wrote in 891 a Book of the Countries, giving a reliable
account of Islamic provinces and cities, and of many foreign states.
Muhammad al-Muqaddasi visited all the lands of Islam except Spain,
suffered countless vicissitudes, and in 985 wrote his Description of the
Moslem Empire — the greatest work of Arabic geogra- phy before al-
Biruni’s India.</p>
<p>CHAP.XII) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 243</p>
<p>Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (973-1048) shows the
Moslem scholar at his best. Philosopher, historian, traveler,
geographer, lin- guist, mathematician, astronomer, poet, and physicist —
and doing major and original work in all these fields — he was at least
the Leibniz, 25 almost the Leonardo, of Islam. Born like al-Khwarizmi
near the modern Khiva, he sig- nalized again the leadership of the
Transcaspian region in this culminating century of medieval science. The
princes of Khwarizm and Tabaristan, rec- ognizing his talents, gave him
a place at their courts. Hearing of the bevy of poets and philosophers
at Khwarizm, Mahmud of Ghazni asked its prince to send him al-Biruni,
Ibn Sina, and other savants; the prince felt obliged to comply (1018),
and al-Biruni went to live in honor and studious peace with the
bellicose ravisher of India. Perhaps it was in Mahmud’s train that al -
Biruni entered India; in any case he stayed there several years, and
learned the language and the antiquities of the country. Returning to
Mahmud’s court, he became a favorite of that incalculable despot. A
visitor from northern Asia offended the king by describing a region,
which he claimed to have seen, where for many months the sun never set;
Mahmud was about to im- prison the man for jesting with royalty when
al-Biruni explained the phe- nomenon to the satisfaction of the king and
the great relief of the visitor. 26 Mahmud’s son Masud, himself an
amateur scientist, showered gifts and money upon al-Biruni, who often
returned them to the treasury as much ex- ceeding his needs.</p>
<p>His first major work ( c. 1000) was a highly technical treatise — V
estiges of the Past (Athar-ul-Baqiy a) — on the calendars and religious
festivals of the Persians, Syrians, Greeks, Jews, Christians, Sabaeans,
Zoroastrians, and Arabs. It is an unusually impartial study, utterly
devoid of religious animosities. As a Moslem al-Biruni inclined to the
Shia sect, with an unobtrusive tendency to agnosticism. He retained,
however, a degree of Persian patriotism, and condemned the Arabs for
destroying the high civilization of the Sasanian re- gime. 27 Otherwise
his attitude was that of the objective scholar, assiduous in research,
critical in the scrutiny of traditions and texts (including the Gos -
pels) , precise and conscientious in statement, frequently admitting his
igno- rance, and promising to pursue his inquiries till the truth should
emerge. In the preface to the Vestiges he wrote like Francis Bacon: “We
must clear our minds… from all causes that blind people to the truth —
old custom, party spirit, personal rivalry or passion, the desire for
influence.” While his host was devastating India al-Biruni spent many
years studying its peoples, lan- guages, faiths, cultures, and castes.
In 1030 he published his masterpiece, History of India ( Tarikh
al-Hind). At the outset he sharply distinguished between hearsay and
eyewitness reports, and classified the varieties of “liars” who have
written history. 28 He spent little space on the political history of
India, but gave forty-two chapters to Hindu astronomy, and eleven to
Hindu religion. He was charmed by the Bhagavad Gita. He saw the
simi-</p>

<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>larity between the mysticism of the Vedanta, the Sufis, the
Neopythagoreans, and the Neoplatonists; he compared excerpts from Indian
thinkers with like passages from Greek philosophers, and expressed his
preference for the Greeks. “India,” he wrote, “has produced no Socrates;
no logical method has there expelled fantasy from science.” 29
Nevertheless he translated several Sanskrit works of science into
Arabic, and, as if to pay a debt, rendered into Sanskrit Euclid’s
Elements and Ptolemy’s Almagest.</p>
<p>His interest extended to nearly all the sciences. He gave the best
medieval account of the Hindu numerals. He wrote treatises on the
astrolabe, the plani- sphere, the armillary sphere; and formulated
astronomical tables for Sultan Masud. He took it for granted that the
earth is round, noted “the attraction</p>
<p>Chemistry as a science was almost created by the Moslems; for in this
field, where the Greeks (so far as we know) were confined to industrial
experi- ence and vague hypothesis, the Saracens introduced precise
observation, con- trolled experiment, and careful records. They invented
and named the alem- bic ( al-anbiq ), chemically analyzed innumerable
substances, composed lapidaries, distinguished alkalis and acids,
investigated their affinities, studied and manufactured hundreds of
drugs.* Alchemy, which the Moslems inheri- ted from Egypt, contributed
to chemistry by a thousand incidental discov-</p>

<p>eries, and by its method, which was the most scientific of all
medieval opera- tions. Practically all Moslem scientists believed that
all metals were ultimately of the same species, and could therefore be
transmuted one into another. The aim of the alchemists was to change
“base” metals like iron, copper, lead, or tin into silver or gold; the
“philosopher’s stone” was a substance— ever sought, never found — which
when properly treated would effect this trans- mutation. Blood, hair,
excrement, and other materials were treated with vari- ous reagents, and
were subjected to calcination, sublimation, sunlight, and fire, to see
if they contained this magic al-iksir or essence. 36 He who should
possess this elixir would be able at will to prolong his life. The most
famous of the alchemists was Jabir ibn Hayyan (702-65), known to Europe
as Gebir. Son of a Kufa druggist, he practiced as a physician, but spent
most of his time with alembic and crucible. The hundred or more works
attributed to him were produced by unknown authors, chiefly in the tenth
century; many of these anonymous works were translated into Latin, and
strongly stimulated the development of European chemistry. After the
tenth century the science of chemistry, like other sciences, gave ground
to occultism, and did not lift its head again for almost three hundred
years.</p>
<p>The remains of Moslem biology in this period are scant. Abu Hanifa
al- Dinawari (815-95) wrote a Book of Plants based on Dioscorides, but
adding many plants to pharmacology. Mohammedan botanists knew how to
pro- duce new fruits by grafting; they combined the rose bush and the
almond tree to generate rare and lovely flowers. 37 Othman Amr al-Jahiz
(d. 869) propounded a theory of evolution like al- Masudi’s: life had
climbed “from mineral to plant, from plant to animal, from animal to
man.” 38 The mystic poet Jalal ud-din accepted the theory, and merely
added that if this has been achieved in the past, then in the next stage
men will become angels, and fi- nally God. 39</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MEDICINE</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile men loved life while maligning it, and spent great sums to
stave off death. The Arabs had entered Syria with only primitive medical
knowl- edge and equipment. As wealth came, physicians of better caliber
were de- veloped in Syria and Persia, or were brought in from Greece and
India. Forbidden by their religion to practice vivisection, or the
dissection of human cadavers, Moslem anatomy had to content itself with
Galen and the study of wounded men. Arabic medicine was weakest in
surgery, strongest in medicaments and therapy. To the ancient
pharmacopeia the Saracens added ambergris, camphor, cassia, cloves,
mercury, senna, myrrh; and they introduced new pharmaceutical
preparations — sirups (Arabic sharab ), juleps ( golab ) , rose water,
etc. One of the main features of Italian trade with the Near East was
the importation of Arabic drugs. The Moslems established the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>first apothecary shops and dispensaries, founded the first medieval
school of pharmacy, and wrote great treatises on pharmacology. Moslem
physicians were enthusiastic advocates of the bath, especially in fevers
40 and in the form of the steam bath. Their directions for the treatment
of smallpox and measles could scarcely be bettered today. 41 Anesthesia
by inhalation was practiced in some surgical operations; 42 hashish and
other drugs were used to induce deep sleep. 43 We know of thirty-four
hospitals established in Islam in this period, 44 apparently on the
model of the Persian academy and hospital at Jund-i- Shapur; in Baghdad
the earliest known to us was set up under Harun al- Rashid, and five
others were opened there in the tenth century; in 9 1 8 we hear of a
director of hospitals in Baghdad. 45 The most famous hospital in Islam
was the bimaristan founded in Damascus in 706; in 978 it had a staff of
twenty-four physicians. Medical instruction was given chiefly at the
hos- pitals. No man could legally practice medicine without passing an
examina- tion and receiving a state diploma; druggists, barbers, and
orthopedists were likewise subject to state regulation and inspection.
The physician-vizier Ali ibn Isa organized a staff of doctors to go from
place to place to tend the sick (931); certain physicians made daily
visits to jails; there was an especially humane treatment of the insane.
But public sanitation was in most places poorly developed; and in four
centuries forty epidemics ravaged one or an- other country of the Moslem
East.</p>
<p>In 93 1 there were 860 licensed physicians in Baghdad. 40 Fees rose
with proximity to the court. Jibril ibn Bakhtisha, physician to Harun,
al-Mamun, and the Barmakids, amassed a fortune of 88,800,000 dirhems
(,104,000); we are told that he received 100,000 dirhems for bleeding
the caliph twice a year, and a like sum for giving him a semiannual
purgative. 47 He successfully treated hysterical paralysis in a slave
girl by pretending to disrobe her in public. From Jibril onward there is
a succession of famous physicians in East- ern Islam: Yuhanna ibn
Masawayh (777-857) , who studied anatomy by dis- secting apes; Hunain
ibn Ishaq, the translator, author of Ten Treatises on the Eye — the
oldest systematic textbook of ophthalmology; and Ali ibn Isa, greatest
of Moslem oculists, whose Manual for Oculists was used as a text in
Europe till the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The outstanding figure in this humane dynasty of healers was Abu Bekr
Muhammad al-Razi (844-926), famous in Europe as Rhazes. Like most of the
leading scientists and poets of his time, he was a Persian writing in
Arabic. Born at Rayy near Tehran, he studied chemistry, alchemy, and
medicine at Baghdad, and wrote some 1 3 1 books, half of them on
medicine, most of them lost. His Kitab al-Hawi ( Comprehensive Book )
covered in twenty volumes every branch of medicine. Translated into
Latin as Liber continens , it was probably the most highly respected and
frequently used medical textbook in the white world for several
centuries; it was one of the nine books that composed the whole library
of the medical faculty at the University of Paris</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 247</p>
<p>in 1 395 , 48 His Treatise on Smallpox and Measles was a masterpiece
of direct observation and clinical analysis; it was the first accurate
study of infectious diseases, the first effort to distinguish the two
ailments. We may judge its in- fluence and repute by the forty English
editions printed between 1498 and</p>
<ol start="1866" type="1">
<li>The most famous of al- Razi’s works was a ten -volume survey of
medi- cine, the Kitab al-Mansuri ( Book for al-Mansur), dedicated to a
prince of Khurasan. Gerard of Cremona translated it into Latin; the
ninth volume of this translation, the Nonas Almansoris, was a popular
text in Europe till the sixteenth century. Al-Razi introduced new
remedies like mercurial oint- ment, and the use of animal gut in
sutures. He checked the enthusiasm for urinalysis in an age when
physicians were prone to diagnose any disease by examining the urine,
sometimes without seeing the patient. Some of his shorter works showed a
genial side; one was “On the Fact That Even Skill - ful Physicians
Cannot Cure All Diseases”; another was entitled, “Why Igno - rant
Physicians, Laymen, and Women Have More Success than Learned Medical
Men.” Al -Razi was by common consent the greatest of Moslem physicians,
and the greatest clinician of the Middle Ages. 40 He died in pov- erty
at the age of eighty-two.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the school of medicine at the University of Paris hang two
portraits of Moslem physicians — “Rhazes” and “Avicenna.” Islam knew its
greatest phi - losopher and most famous physician as Abu Ali al-Husein
ibn Sina (980-</p>
<p>1037). His autobiography — one of the few in Arabic literature —
shows us how mobile might be, in medieval days, the life of a scholar or
sage. Son of a money-changer of Bokhara, Avicenna was educated by
private tutors, who gave a Sufi mystic turn to an otherwise scientific
mind. “At the age of ten,” says Ibn Khallikan, with customary Oriental
hyperbole, “he was a perfect master of the Koran and general literature,
and had obtained a certain degree of information in theology,
arithmetic, and algebra.” 50 He studied medicine without a teacher, and
while still young began to give gratis treatment. At seventeen he
brought back to health the ailing ruler of Bokhara, Nuh ibn Mansur,
became an official of the court, and spent eager hours in the Sultan’s
voluminous library. The breakup of the Samanid power towards the end of
the tenth century led Avicenna to take service under al-Mamun, prince of
Khwarizm. When Mahmud of Ghazni sent for Avicenna, al-Biruni, and other
intellectual lights of al- Mamun’s court, Avicenna refused to go. With a
fel - low scholar, Masihi, he escaped into the desert. There in a dust
storm Masihi died; but Avicenna, after many hardships, reached Gurgan,
and took service at the court of Qabus. Mahmud circulated throughout
Persia a picture of Avicenna, and offered a reward for his capture, but
Qabus protected him. When Qabus was murdered, Avicenna was called to
treat the emir of Hama- dan; he succeeded so well that he was made
vizier. But the army did not like his rule; it seized him, pillaged his
home, and proposed his death. He escaped, hid himself in the rooms of a
druggist, and began in his confinement to write</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>he books that were to make his fame. As he was planning a secret
departure from Hamadan he was arrested by the emir’s son, and spent
several months in jail, where he continued his writing. He again
escaped, disguised himself as a Sufi mystic, and after adventures too
numerous for our space found refuge and honors at the court of Ala
ad-Dawla, the Buwayhid Emir of Isfa- han. A circle of scientists and
philosophers gathered about him, and held learned conferences over which
the emir liked to preside. Some stories sug- gest that the philosopher
enjoyed the pleasures of love as well as of scholar- ship; on the other
hand we get reports of him as absorbed day and night in study, teaching,
and public affairs; and Ibn Khallikan quotes from him some unhackneyed
counsel: “Take one meal a day…. Preserve the seminal fluid with care; it
is the water of life, to be poured into the womb.” 51 Wor n out too
soon, he died at fifty-seven on a journey to Hamadan, where to this day
pious veneration guards his grave.</p>
<p>Amid these vicissitudes he found time, in office or in jail, in
Persian or in Arabic, to write a hundred books, covering nearly every
field of science and philosophy. For good measure he composed excellent
poems, of which fif- teen survive; one of them slipped into the Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam; an- other, “The Descent of the Soul” (into the body
from a higher sphere), is still memorized by young students in the
Moslem East. He translated Euclid, made astronomical observations, and
devised an instrument like our vernier. He made original studies of
motion, force, vacuum, light, heat, and specific gravity. His treatise
on minerals was a main source of European geology until the thirteenth
century. His remarks on the formation of mountains is a model of
clarity:</p>
<p>Mountains may be due to two different causes. Either they result</p>
<p>from upheavals of the earth’s crust, such as might occu r in
violent</p>
<p>earthquake; or they are the effect of water, which, cutting for
itself</p>
<p>a new route, has denuded the valleys. The strata are of different
kinds, some soft, some hard; the winds and waters disintegrate the first
kind, but leave the other intact. It would require a long period of time
for all such changes to be accomplished… but that water has been the
main cause of these effects is proved by the existence of fossil remains
of aquatic animals on many mountains. 52</p>
<p>Two gigantic produ ctions contain Avicenna’s teaching: th zKitab al
-Shif a, or Book of Healing (of the soul), an eighteen- volume
encyclopedia of mathematics, physics, metaphysics, theology, economics,
politics, and music; and the Qanun-fi-l-Tibb, or Canon of Medicine, a
gigantic survey of physi- ology, hygiene, therapy, and pharmacology,
with sundry excursions into philosophy. The Qanun is well organized, and
has moments of eloquence; but its scholastic passion for classification
and distinction becomes the one disease for which the author has no
prescription. He begins with a discour- aging admonition: “Every
follower of my teachings who wishes to use them</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 249</p>
<p>profitably should memorize most of this work,” 52a which c ontains a
million words. He conceives medicine as the art of removing an
impediment to the normal functioning of nature. He deals first with the
major diseases — their symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment; he has
chapters on general and indi- vidual prophylaxis and hygiene, and on
therapy through enemas, bleeding, cautery, baths, and massage. He
recommends deep breathing, even occa- sional shouting, to develop the
lungs, chest — and uvula. Book II summarizes Greek and Arabic knowledge
of medicinal plants. Book III, on special pa- thology, contains
excellent discussions of pleurisy, empyema, intestinal dis- orders,
sexual diseases, perversions, and nervous ailments, including love. Book
IV discusses fevers, surgery, and cosmetics, the care of the hair and
the skin. Book V — materia medica — gives detailed directions for
concocting 760 drugs. The Qanun, translated into Latin in the twelfth
century, dethroned al-Razi, and even Galen, as the chief text in
European medical schools; it held its place as required reading in the
universities of Montpellier and Lou- vain till the middle of the
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Avicenna was the greatest writer on medicine, al-Razi the greatest
physi- cian, al-Biruni the greatest geographer, al-Haitham the greatest
optician, Jabir probably the greatest chemist, of the Middle Ages; these
five names, so little known in present-day Christendom, are one measure
of our provincial- ism in viewing medieval history. Arabic, like all
medieval science, was often sullied with occultism; except in optics it
excelled rather in the synthesis of accumulated results than in original
findings or systematic research; at the same time, however haltingly, it
developed in alchemy that experimental method which is the greatest
pride and tool of the modern mind. When Roger Bacon proclaimed that
method to Europe, five hundred years after Jabir, he owed his
illumination to the Moors of Spain, whose light had come from the Moslem
East.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>
</ol>
<p>In philosophy, as in science, Islam borrowed from Christian Syria the
legacy of pagan Greece, and returned it through Moslem Spain to
Christian Europe. Many influences, of course, ran together to produce
the intellectual rebellion of the Mutazilites, and the philosophies of
al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Avi- cenna, and Averroes. Hindu speculations came
in through Ghazni and Persia; Zoroastrian and Jewish eschatology played
some minor role; and Christian heretics had stirred the air of the Near
East with debate on the at- tributes of God, the nature of Christ and
the Logos, predestination and free will, revelation and reason. But the
yeast that caused the ferment of thought in Moslem Asia — as in
Renaissance Italy — was the rediscovery of Greece. Here, through however
imperfect translations of apocryphal texts, a new world appeared: one in
which men had reasoned fearlessly about everything,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>unchecked by sacred scriptures, and had conceived a cosmos not of
divine whimsy and incalculable miracle, but of majestic and omnipresent
law. Greek logic, fully conveyed through Aristotle’s Organon, came like
an intoxication to Moslems now gifted with leisure to think; here were
the terms and implements they needed for thought; now for three
centuries Islam p layed the new game of logic, drunk like the Athenian
youth of Plato’s time with the “dear delight” of philosophy. Soon the
whole edifice of Mo - hammedan dogma began to tremble and crack, as
Greek orthodoxy had melted under the Sophists’ eloquence, as Ch ristian
orthodoxy would wince and wilt under the blows of the Encyclopedists and
the whips of Vol- taire’s wit.</p>
<p>What might be called the Moslem Enlightenment had its proximate
origin in a strange dispute. Was the Koran eternal or created? Philo’s
doct rine of the Logos as the timeless Wisdom of God; the Fourth
Gospel’s identification of Christ with the Logos, the Divine Word or
Reason, that was “in the be - ginning… was God,” and “without which was
not anything made that was made”; 53 the Gnosti c and Neoplatonic
personification of Divine Wisdom as the agent of creation; the Jewish
belief in the eternity of the Torah — all con- spired to beget in
orthodox Islam a correlative view that the Koran had al- ways existed in
the mind of Allah, and that only its revelation to Mohammed was an event
in time. The first expression of philosophy in Islam (c. 757) was the
growth of a school of “Mutazilites”— i.e., Seceders — who denied the
eter- nity of the Koran. They protested their respect for Islam’s hol y
book, but they argued that where it or the Hadith contradicted reason,
the Koran or the traditions must be interpreted allegorically; and they
gave the name kalam or logic to this effort to reconcile reason and
faith. It seemed to them absurd to take literally those Koranic passages
that ascribed hands and feet, anger and hatred, to Allah; such poetic
anthropomorphism, however adapted to the moral and political ends of
Mohammed at the time, could hardly be accepted by the educated
intellect. The human mind could never know what was the real nature or
attributes of God; it could only agree with faith in affirming a
spiritual power as the foundation of all reality. Furthermore, to the
Mutazilites, it seemed fatal to human morality and enterprise to
believe, as orthodoxy did, in the complete predestination of all events
by God, and the arbitrary election, from all eternity, of the saved and
the damned.</p>
<p>In a hundred variations of these themes, Mutazilite doctrines spread
rap- idly under the rule of al-Mansur, Harun al-Rashid, and al-Mamun. At
first in the privacy of scholars and infidels, then in the soirees of
the caliphs, fi - nally in the lecture circles of colleges and mosques,
the new rationalism won a voice, even, here and there, ascendancy.
Al-Mamun was fascinated by this fledgling flight of reason, defended it,
and ended by proclaiming the Mutazi- lite views as the official faith of
the realm. Mingling old habits of Oriental monarchy with the latest
ideas of Hellenizing Moslems, al-Mamun in 832</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 251</p>
<p>issued a decree requiring all Moslems to admit that the Koran had
been cre- ated in time; a later decree ruled that no one could be a
witness in law, or a judge, unless he declared his acceptance of the new
dogma; further decrees extended this obligatory acceptance to the
doctrines of free will, and the im- possibility of the soul ever seeing
God with a physical eye; at last, refusal to take these tests and oaths
was made a capital crime. Al-Mamun died in 833, but his. successors
al-Mutassim and al-Wathiq continued his campaign. The theologian Ibn
Hanbal denounced this inquisition; summoned to take the tests, he
answered all questions by quoting the Koran in favor of the ortho- dox
view. He was scourged to unconsciousness and cast into jail; but his
suf- ferings made him, in the eyes of the people, a martyr and a saint,
and prepared for the reaction that overwhelmed Moslem philosophy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile that philosophy had produced its first major figure. Abu
Yusuf Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi was born in Kufa about 803, son of the
governor of the city; he studied there and at Baghdad, and won a high
reputation at the courts of al-Mamun and al-Mutassim as translator,
scientist, and philoso- pher. Like so many thinkers in that confident
heyday of the Moslem mind, he was an omnivorous polymath, studying
everything, writing 265 treatises about everything — arithmetic,
geometry, astronomy, meteorology, geogra- phy, physics, politics, music,
medicine, philosophy He agreed with Plato</p>
<p>hat no one could be a philosopher without being first a
mathematician, and he struggled to reduce health, medicine, and music to
mathematical relations. He studied the tides, sought the laws that
determine the speed of a falling body, and investigated the phenomena of
light in a book on Optics which in- fluenced Roger Bacon. He shocked the
Moslem world by writing an</p>
<p>Apology for Christianity , 54 He and an aide translated the
apocryphal Theol- ogy of Aristotle ; he was deeply impressed by this
forgery, and rejoiced in the thought that it reconciled Aristotle with
Plato — by turning both of them into Neoplatonists. Al- Kindi’s
philosophy was Neoplatonism restated: spirit has three grades — God, the
creative World Soul or Logos, and its emanation, the soul of man; if a
man trains his soul to right knowledge he can achieve free- dom and
deathlessness. 55 Apparently al-Kindi made heroic efforts to be or-
thodox; yet he took from Aristotle 56 the distinction between the active
intel- lect, which is divine, and the passive intellect of man, which is
merely the capacity for thought; Avicenna would transmit this
distinction to Averroes, who would set the world by the ears with it as
an argument against personal immortality. Al-Kindi associated with
Mutazilites; when the reaction came his library was confiscated, and his
deathlessness hung by a thread. He sur- vived the storm, recovered his
liberty, and lived till 873.</p>
<p>In a society where government, law, and morality are bound up with a
religious creed, any attack upon that creed is viewed as menacing the
founda- tions of social order itself. All the forces that had been
beaten down by the Arab conquest — Greek philosophy, Gnostic
Christianity, Persian national-</p>

<p>ism, Mazdakite communism — were rampantly resurgent; the Koran was
questioned and ridiculed; a Persian poet was decapitated for proclaiming
the superiority of his verses to the Koran (784); 67 the whole structure
of Islam, resting on the Koran, seemed ready to collapse. In this crisis
three fac- tors made orthodoxy victorious: a conservative caliph, the
rise of the Turk- ish guard, and the natural loyalty of the people to
their inherited beliefs. Al- Mutawakkil, coming to the throne in 847,
based his support upon the populace and the Turks; and the Turks, new
converts to Mohammedanism, hostile to the Persians, and strangers to
Greek thought, gave themselves with a whole heart to a policy of saving
the faith by the sword. Al-Mutawakkil annulled and reversed the
illiberal liberalism of al-Mamun; Mutazilites and other heretics were
expelled from governmental employ and educational po- sitions; any
expression of heterodox ideas in literature or philosophy was for-
bidden; the eternity of the Koran was re-established by law. The Shia
sect was proscribed, and the shrine of Husein at Kerbela was destroyed
(851). The edict allegedly issued by Omar I against Christians, and
extended to the Jews by Harun (807) and soon again ignored, was reissued
by al-Mutawak- kil (850); Jews and Christians were ordered to wear a
distinctive color of dress, put colored patches on the garments of their
slaves, ride only on mules and asses, and affix wooden devils to their
doors. New churches and syna- gogues were to be pulled down, and no
public elevation of the cross was to be allowed in Christian ceremonies.
No Christian or Jew was to receive edu- cation in Moslem schools. 58</p>
<p>In the next generation the reaction took a milder form. Some orthodox
theologians, bravely accepting the gage of logic, proposed to prove by
reason the truth of the traditional faith. These mutakallivmn (i.e.,
logicians) were the Scholastics of Islam; they undertook that same
reconciliation of religious dogma with Greek philosophy which Maimonides
in the twelfth century would attempt for Judaism, and Thomas Aquinas in
the thirteenth for Chris- tianity. Abul-Hasan al-Ashari (873-935) of
Basra, after teaching Mutazilite doctrines for a decade, turned against
them in his fortieth year, attacked them with the Mutazilite weapon of
logic, and poured forth a stream of con- servative polemics that shared
powerfully in the victory of the old creed. He accepted the
predestinarianism of Mohammed without flinching: God has predetermined
every act and event, and is their primary cause; He is above all law and
morals; He “rules as a sovereign over His creatures, doing what He
wills; if He were to send them all to hell there would be no wrong.” 58
Not all the orthodox relished this submission of the faith to
intellectual de- bate; many proclaimed the formula Bila kayf — “Believe
without asking how.” 00 The theologians for the most part ceased to
discuss basic issues, but lost themselves in the scholastic minutiae of
a doctrine whose fundamentals they accepted as axioms.</p>
<p>The ferment of philosophy subsided at Baghdad, only to emerge at
minor</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 253</p>
<p>courts. Sayfu’l -Dawla provided a house at Aleppo for Muhammad Abu
Nasr al-Farabi, the first Turk to make a name in philosophy. Born at
Farab in Turkestan, he studied logic under Christian teachers at Baghdad
and Har- ran, read Aristotle’s Physics forty times and the De Anima 200
times, was denounced as a heretic at Baghdad, adopted the doctrine and
dress of a Sufi, and lived like the swallows of the air. “He was the
most indifferent of men to the things of this world,” says Ibn
Khallikan; “he never gave himself the least trouble to acquire a
livelihood or po ssess a habitation.” 61 Sayfu’l -Dawla asked him how
much he needed for his maintenance; al-Farabi thought that four dirhems
(.00) a day would suffice; the prince settled this allowance on him for
life.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine works by al-Farabi survive, many of them commentaries on
Aristotle. His Ihsa al-ulum, or Encyclopedia of Science , summarized the
knowledge of his time in philology, logic, mathematics, physics,
chemistry, economics, and politics. He answered with a straightforward
negative the question that would soon agitate the Scholastic
philosophers of Christen- dom: Does the universal (the genus, the
species, or the quality) exist apart from the specific individual?
Deceived like the rest by the Theology of Aris - totle, he transformed
the hard-headed Stagirite into a mystic, and lived long enough to
subside into orthodox belief. Having in his youth professed a theo-
retical agnosticism, 82 he progressed sufficiently in later life to give
a detailed description of the deity. 63 He took over Ari stotle’s proofs
of God’s existence very much as Aquinas would do three centuries later:
a chain of contingent events requires for its intelligibility an
ultimate necessary being; a chain of causes requires a First Cause; a
series of motions requires a Prime Mover un- moved; multiplicity
requires unity. The ultimate goal of philosophy, never quite attainable,
is knowledge of the First Cause; the best approach to such knowledge is
purity of soul. Like Aristotle, al-Farabi carefully managed to make
himself unintelligible on immortality. He died at Damascus in 950.</p>
<p>One work alone, among his remains, strikes us with its original
force: Al- Medina al-Fadila — The Ideal City. It opens with a
description of the law of nature as one of perpetual struggle of each
organism against all the rest — Hobbes* bellum omnium contra omnes ;
every living thing, in the last analy- sis, sees in all other living
things a means to its ends. Some cynics argue from this, says al-Farabi,
that in this inescapable competition the wise man is he who best bends
others to his will, and most fully achieves his own desires. How did
human society emerge from this jungle law? If we may trust al- Farabi’s
account, there were both Rousseauians and Nietzscheans among the Moslems
who took up this question: some thought that society had begun in an
agreement, among individuals, that their survival required the accept-
ance of certain restraints through custom or law; others laughed this
“social contract” out of history, and insisted t hat society, or the
state, had begun as the conquest and regimentation of the weak by the
strong. States themselves,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>said these Nietzscheans, are organs of competition; it is natural
that states should struggle with one another for ascendancy, security,
power, and wealth; war is natural and inevitable; and in that final
arbitrament, as in the law of nature, the only right is might. Al-Farabi
counters this view with an appeal to his fellow men to build a society
not upon envy, power, and strife, but upon reason, devotion, and love.
64 He ends safely by recommending a monarchy based upon strong religious
belief. 65</p>
<p>A pupil of a pupil of al-Farabi established at Baghdad, about 970, an
as- sociation of savants — known to us only from its founder’s place
name as the Sidjistani Society — for the discussion of philosophical
problems. No ques- tions were asked as to the national origin or
religious affiliation of any mem- ber. The group seems to have drowned
itself in logic and epistemology, but its existence indicates that
intellectual appetite survived in the capital. Of greater moment or
result was a similar but secret fraternity of scientists and
philosophers organized at Basra about 983. These “Brethren of Sincerity”
or Purity (Jkhwan al-Safa ) were alarmed by the weakening of the
caliphate, the poverty of the people, and the corruption of morals; they
aspired to a moral, spiritual, and political renovation of Islam; and
thought that this re- newal might be founded upon a blend of Greek
philosophy, Christian ethics, Sufi mysticism, Shia politics, and Moslem
law. They conceived friendship as a collaboration of abilities and
virtues, each party bringing to the union a quality of which the others
had lack and need; truth, they thought, comes more readily from a
meeting of minds than from individual thought. So they privately met and
discussed, with fine freedom, catholicity, and courtesy, all the basic
problems of life, and finally issued fifty-one tracts as their consid-
ered and co-operative system and epitome of science, religion, and phi-
losophy. A Spanish Moslem, traveling in the Near East about the year
1000, took a fancy to these treatises, collected them, and preserved
them. In these 1134 pages we find scientific explanations of tides,
earthquakes, eclipses, sound waves, and many other natural phenomena; a
full acceptance of astrology and alchemy; and occasional dallying with
magic and numer- ology. The theology, as in nearly all Moslem thinkers,
is Gnostic and Neo- platonic: from the First Cause or God emanates the
Active Intelligence (Logos, Reason), from which proceeds the world of
bodies and souls. All material things are formed by, and act through,
soul. Every soul is restless until it rejoins the Active Intelligence or
World Soul. This union demands absolute purity in the soul; ethics is
the art of attaining this purity; science, philosophy, and religion are
means to such purification. In seeking purity we must try to model
ourselves upon the intellectual devotion of Socrates, the universal
charity of Christ, and the modest nobility of Ali. When the mind has
been emancipated by knowledge it should feel free to reinterpret through
allegory, and thereby reconcile with philoso phy, “the crude expressions
of the Koran, which were adapted to the understanding of an uncivilized
desert</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>people” 66 — a sharp Persian retort to Arab pride. All in all, these
fifty-one tracts constitute the fullest and most consistent expression
that we possess of Moslem thought in the Abbasid age. The orthodox
leaders in Baghdad burned them as heresy in 1 1 50, but they continued
to circulate, and exercised a per- vasive influence upon Moslem and
Jewish philosophy — upon al-Ghazali and Averroes, ibn Gabirol and Judah
Halevi, 67 the philosophical poet al- Ma‘arri, and perhaps upon the man
who in his brief life rivaled the scope and depth, and surpassed the
rationality, of this co-operative synthesis.</p>
<p>For Ibn Sina — Avicenna — was not content to be a scientist and a
world- renowned authority on medicine; doubtless he knew that a
scientist com- pletes himself only through philosophy. He tells us that
he read Aristotle’s Metaphysics forty times without understanding it,
and that when al- Farabi’s commentary enabled him to comprehend the book
he was so happy and grateful that he rushed into the street and
scattered alms. 68 Aristotle re- mained to the end his ideal in
philosophy; already in the Qanun he used of him that phrase, “the
philosopher,” which was to become in the Latin world a synonym for
Aristotle. He detailed his own philosophy in the Kitab al- Shifa, and
then summarized it in the Najat. He had a flair for logic, and in-
sisted on precise definitions. He gave the classic medieval answer to
the question whether universals or general ideas (man, virtue , redness
) exist apart from individual things: they exist ( 1 ) ante res ,
“before the things,” in the mind of God as Platonic exemplars according
to which the things are made; (2) in rebus, “in the things” in which
they appear or are exemplified; and (3 ) post res, “after the things,”
as abstract(ed) ideas in the human mind; but universals do not exist in
the natural world apart from individual things. Abelard and Aquinas
would, after a century of turmoil, give the same reply.</p>
<p>Indeed, Avicenna’s metaphysics is almost a summary of what, two cen -
turies after him, the Latin thinkers would syncretize as the Scholastic
phi- losophy. He begins with a laborious restatement of Aristotle and
al-Farabi on matter and form, the four causes, the contingent and the
necessary, the many and the one, and frets over the puzzle of how the
contingent and changeable many — the multiplicity of mortal things —
could ever have flowed from the necessary and changeless One. Like
Plotinus he thinks to solve the problem by postulating an intermediate
Active Intelligence, distributed through the celestial, material, and
human world as souls. Finding some diffi- culty in reconciling God’s
passage from noncreation to creation with the di - vine immutability, he
proposes to believe, with Aristotle, in the eternity of the material
world; but knowing that this will offend the mutakallimun, he offers
them a compromise by a favorite Scholastic distinction: God is prior to
the world not in time but logically, i.e., in rank and essence and
cause: the existence of the world depends at every moment upon the
existence of its sustaining force, which is God. Avicenna concedes that
all entities but God are contingent — i.e., their existence is not
inevitable or indispensable. Since</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>such contingent things require a cause for their existence, they
cannot be explained except by reverting, in the chain of causes, to a
necessary being- one whose essence or meaning involves existence, a
being whose existence must be presupposed in order to explain any other
existence. God is the only being that exists by its own essence; it is
essential that He exist, for without such a First Cause nothing that is
could have begun to be. Since all matter is contingent — i.e., its
essence does not involve existence — God cannot be ma- terial. For like
reasons He must be simple and one. Since there is intelligence in
created beings, there must be intelligence in their creator. The Supreme
Intelligence sees all things — past, present, and future — not in time
or sequence but at once; their occurrence is the temporal result of His
timeless thought. But God does not directly cause each action or event;
things develop by an internal teleology — they have their purposes and
destinies written in them- selves. Therefore God is not responsible for
evil; evil is the price we pay for freedom of will; and the evil of the
part may be the good of the whole. 89</p>
<p>The existence of the soul is attested by our most immediate internal
per- ception. The soul is spiritual for the same reason: we simply
perceive it to be so; our ideas are clearly distinct from our organs.
The soul is the principle of self-movement and growth in a body; in this
sense even the celestial spheres have souls; “the whole cosmos is the
manifestation of a universal principle of life.” 70 By itself a body can
cause nothing; the ca use of its every motion is its inherent soul. Each
soul or intelligence possesses a measure of freedom and creative power
akin to that of the First Cause, for it is an ema- nation of that Cause.
After death the pure soul returns to union with the World Soul; and in
this union lies the blessedness of the good. 71</p>
<p>Avicenna achieved as well as any man the ever-sought reconciliation
be- tween the faith of the people and the reasoning of the philosophers.
He did not wish, like Lucretius, to destroy religion for the sake of
philosophy, nor, like al-Ghazali in the ensuing century, to destroy
philosophy for the sake of religion. He treats all questions with reason
only, quite independently of the Koran, and gives a naturalistic
analysis of inspiration ; 72 but he affirms the people’s need of
prophets who expound to them the laws of morality in forms and parables
popularly intelligible and effective; in this sense, as laying or
preserving the foundations of social and moral development, the prophet
is God’s messenger. 73 So Mohammed preached the resurrection of the
body, and sometimes described heaven in material terms; the philosopher
will doubt the immortality of the body, but he will recognize that if
Mohammed had taught a purely spiritual heaven the people would not have
listened to him, and would not have united into a disciplined and
powerful nation. Those who can worship God in spiritual love,
entertaining neither hope nor fear, are the highest of mankind; but they
will reveal this attitude only to their maturest students, not to the
multitude. 74</p>
<p>Avicenna’s Shifa and Qanun mark the apex of medieval thought, and con
-</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 257</p>
<p>stitute one of the major syntheses in the history of the mind. Much
of it fol- lowed the lead of Aristotle and al-Farabi, as much of
Aristotle followed Plato; only lunatics can be completely original.
Avicenna occasionally talks what seems to our fallible judgment to be
nonsense; but that is also true of Plato and Aristotle; there is nothing
so foolish but it may be found in the pages of the philosophers.
Avicenna lacked the honest uncertainty, critical spirit, and ever open
mind of al-Biruni, and made many more mistakes; syn- thesis must pay
that price as long as life is brief. He surpassed his rivals in the
clarity and vivacity of his style, in the ability to relieve and
illuminate ab- stract thought with illustrative anecdote and pardonable
poetry, and in the unparalleled scope of his scientific and
philosophical range. His influence was immense: it reached out to Spain
to mold Averroes and Maimonides, and into Latin Christendom to help the
great Scholastics; it is astonishing how much of Albertus Magnus and
Thomas Aquinas goes back to Avicenna. Roger Bacon ca lled him “the chief
authority in philosophy after Aristotle”; 75 and Aquinas was not merely
practicing his customary courtesy in speaking of him with as much
respect as of Plato. 70</p>
<p>Arabic philosophy in the East almost died with Avicenna. Soon after
his culminating effort the orthodox emphasis of the Seljuqs, the
frightened fide- ism of the theologians, the victorious mysticism of
al-Ghazali put a cloture on speculative thought. It is a pity that we
know these three centuries (750-</p>
<ol start="1050" type="1">
<li>of Arabic efflorescence so imperfectly. Thousands of Arabic manu-
scripts in science, literature, and philosophy lie hidden in the
libraries of the Moslem world: in Constantinople alone there are thirty
mosque libraries whose wealth has been merely scratched; in Cairo,
Damascus, Alosul, Bagh- dad, Delhi are great collections not even
catalogued; an immense library in the Escorial near Madrid has hardly
completed the listing of its Islamic manu- scripts in science,
literature, jurisprudence, and philosophy. 77 What we know of Moslem
thought in those centuries is a fragment of what survives, what survives
is a fragment of what was produced; what appears in these pages is a
morsel of a fraction of a fragment. When scholarship has surveyed more
thoroughly this half-forgotten legacy, we shall probably rank the tenth
century in Eastern Islam as one of the golden ages in the history of the
mind.</li>

<p>V. MYSTICISM AND HERESY</p>
<p>At their peak philosophy and religion meet in the sense and
contemplation of universal unity. The soul untouched by logic, too weak
of wing for the metaphysical flight from the many to the one, from
incident to law, might reach that vision through a mystic absorption of
the separate self in the soul of the world. And where science and
philosophy failed, where the brief finite reason of man faltered and
turned blind in the presence of infinity, faith</p>
<p>258 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>might mount to the feet of God by ascetic discipline, unselfish
devotion, the unconditional surrender of the part to the whole.</p>
<p>Moslem mysticism had many roots: the asceticism of the Hindu fakirs,
the Gnosticism of Egypt and Syria, the Neoplatonist speculations of the
later Greeks, and the omnipresent example of ascetic Christian monks. As
in Christendom, so in Islam a pious minority protested against any
accommoda- tion of religion to the interests and practices of the
economic world; they denounced the luxury of caliphs, viziers, and
merchants, and proposed to return to the simplicity of Abu Bekr and Omar
I. They resented any inter- mediary between themselves and the deity;
even the rigid ritual of the mosque seemed to them an obstacle to that
mystic state in which the soul, purified of all earthly concerns, rose
not only to the Beatific Vision but to unity with God. The movement
flourished most in Persia, perhaps through proximity to India, through
Christian influence at Jund-i-Shapur, and through Neoplatonist
traditions established by the Greek philosophers who fled from Athens to
Persia in 529. Most Moslem mystics called themselves Sufis, from the
simple robe of wool ( mf ) that they wore; but within that term were
embraced sincere enthusiasts, exalted poets, pantheists, ascetics,
charlatans, and men with many wives. Their doctrine varied from time to
time, and from street to street. The Sufis, said Averroes, “maintain
that the knowledge of God is found in our own hearts, after our
detachment from all physical desires, and the concentration of the mind
upon the desired ob- ject.” 78 But ma ny Sufis tried to reach God
through external objects too; whatever we see of perfection or
loveliness in the world is due to the presence or operation of divinity
in them. “O God,” said one mystic, “I never listen to the cry of
animals, or the quivering of trees, or the murmur of water, or the song
of birds, or the rustling wind, or the crashing thunder, without feel-
ing them to be an evidence of Thy unity, and a proof that there is
nothing like unto Thee.” 79 In reality, the mystic held, these indiv
idual things exist only by the divine power in them; their sole reality
is this underlying divin- ity. Therefore God is all; not only is there
no god but Allah, there is no being but God. 80 Consequently each soul
is God; and the full-blooded mystic sh amelessly avers that “God and I
are one.” “Verily I am God,” said Abu Yezid ( c. 900) ; “there is no god
but me; worship me.” 81 “I am He Whom I love,” said Husein al - Hallaj;
“and He Whom I love is I…. I am He Who drowned the people of Noah…. I a
m the Truth.” 82 Hallaj was arrested for exaggeration, scourged with a
thousand stripes, and burned to death (922). His followers claimed to
have seen and talked with him after this interrup- tion, and many Sufis
made him their favorite saint.</p>
<p>The Sufi, like the Hindu, believed in a course of discipline as
necessary to the mystic revelation of God: purifying exercises of
devotion, meditation, and prayer; the full obedience of the novice to a
Sufi master or teacher; and the complete abandonment of any personal
desire, even the desire for salva-</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 259</p>
<p>ion or the mystical union. The perfect Sufi loves God for His own
sake, not for any reward; “the Giver,” said Abu’l - Qasim, “is better
for you than the gif t.” 83 Usually, however, the Sufi valued his
discipline as a means of reach - ing a true knowledge of things,
sometimes as a curriculum leading to a degree of miraculous power over
nature, but almost always as a road to union with God. He who had
completely forgotten his individual self in such union was called
al-insanu-l-Kamil — the. Perfect Man. 84 Such a man, the Sufis believed,
was above all laws, even above the obligation to pilgrimage. Said a Sufi
verse: “All eyes toward the Kaaba turn, but ours to the Beloved’s face.”
85</p>
<p>Until the middle of the eleventh century the Sufis continued to live
in the world, sometimes with their families and their children; even the
Sufis attached small moral worth to celibacy. “The true saint,” said Abu
Said, “goe s in and out amongst the people, eats and sleeps with them,
buys and sells in the market, marries and takes part in social
intercourse, and never forgets God for a single moment.” 86 Such Sufis
were distinguished only by their simplicity of life, their piety and
quietism, very much like the early Quakers; and occasionally they
gathered around some holy teacher or exem- plar, or met in groups for
prayer and mutual stimulation to devotion; al- ready in the tenth
century those strange dervish dances were taking form which were to play
so prominent a part in later Sufism. A few became recluses and tormented
themselves, but asceticism was in this period dis- countenanced and
rare. Saints, unknown to early Islam, became numerous in Sufism. One of
the earliest was a woman, Rabia al-Adawiyya of Basra (717-801). Sold as
a slave in youth, she was freed because her master saw a radiance above
her head while she prayed. Refusing marriage, she lived a life of
self-denial and charity. Asked if she hated Satan, she answered, “My
love for God. leaves me no room for hating Satan.” Tradition ascribes to
her a famous Sufi saying: “O God! Give to Thine enemies whatever Thou
hast assigned to me of this world’s goods, and to Thy friends what -
ever Thou hast assigned to me in the life to come; for Thou Thyself art
sufficient for me.” 87</p>
<p>Let us take, as an example of many Sufis, the saint and poet Abu Said
ibn Abi’l -Khayr (967-1049). Bom in Mayhana in Khurasan, he knew
Avi-</p>
<p>cenna; story has it that he said of the philosopher, “What I see he
knows,” and that the philosopher said of him, “What I know he sees.” 88
In his youth he was fond of profane literature, and claims to have
memorized 30,000 verses of pre-Islamic poetry. One day, in his
twenty-sixth year, he heard a lecture by Abu Ali, who took as text the
ninth verse of the sixth sura of the Koran: “Say Allah! then leave them
to amuse themselves in their vain discourse.” “At the moment of hearing
this word,” Abu Said re - lates, “a door in my breast was opened, and I
was rapt from myself.” He collected all his books and burned them. “The
first step in Sufism,” he would say, “is the breaking of inkpots, the
tearing up of books, the forget -</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>ing of all kinds of k nowledge.” He retired to a niche in a chapel of
his home; “there I sat for seven years, saying continually, ’Allah!
Allah!</p>
<p>Allah!’ ”; such repetition of the Holy Name was, with Moslem mystics,
a favorite means of realizing “passing away from self.” He p
racticed</p>
<p>several forms of asceticism: wore the same shirt always, spoke only
in dire need, ate nothing till sunset, and then only a piece of bread;
never lay down to sleep; made an excavation in the wall of his niche or
cell, just high and broad enough to stand in, often closed himself
within it, and stuffed his ears to hear no sound. Sometimes at night he
would lower himself by a rope into a well, head downward, and recite the
entire Koran before emerg- ing — if we were to believe the testimony of
his father. He made himself a servant to other Sufis, begged for them,
cleaned their cells and privies. “Once, whilst I was seated in the
mosque, a woman went up on the roof and bespattered me with filth; and
still I heard a voice saying, ‘Is not thy Lor d enough for thee?’” At
forty he “attained to perfect illumination,” began to preach, and
attracted devoted audiences; some of his hearers, he assures us, smeared
their faces with his ass’s dung “to gain a blessing.” 80 He left his
mark on Sufism by founding a monastery of dervishes, and formulating for
it a set of rules that became a model for similar institutions in later
centuries.</p>
<p>Like Augustine, Abu Said taught that only God’s grace, not man’s good
works, would bring salvation; but he thought of salvation in terms of a
spiritual emancipation independent of any heaven. God opens to man one
gate after another. First the gate of repentance, then</p>
<p>he gate of certainty, so that he accepts contumely and endures abase-
ment, and knows for certain by Whom it is brought to pass…. Then God
opens to him the gate of love; but still he thinks, “I love.”…</p>
<p>Then God opens to him the gate of unity… thereupon he perceives that
all is He, all is by Him… he recognizes that he has not the right</p>
<p>o say, “I” or “mine”… desires fall away from him, and he becomes free
and calm…. Thou wilt never escape from thy self until thou</p>
<p>slay it. Thy self, which is keeping thee far from God, and saying “So
-</p>
<p>and-so has treated me ill… suc h a one has done well by me”— all this
is polytheism; nothing depends upon the creatures, all upon the Cre-
ator. This must thou know; and having said it, thou must stand firm.</p>
<p>… To stand firm means that when thou hast said “One,” thou must</p>
<p>never ag ain say “Two.”… Say “Allah!” and stand firm there. 90</p>
<p>The same Hindu-Emersonian doctrine appears in one of the many
quatrains dubiously ascribed to Abu Said:</p>
<p>Said I, “To whom belongs Thy beauty?” He</p>
<p>Replied, “Since I alone exist, to Me;</p>
<p>Lover, Beloved, and Love am I in one;</p>
<p>Beauty, and Mirror, and the eyes that see.” 91</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM l6l</p>
<p>There being no church to canonize such heroes of ecstasy, they
received the informal canonization of popular acclaim; and by the
twelfth century the Koranic discouragement of the worship of saints as a
form of idolatry had been overwhelmed by the natural sentiments of the
people. An early saint was Ibrahim ibn Adham (eighth century?), the Abou
ben Adhem of Leigh Hunt. Popular imagination attributed miraculous
powers to such saints: they knew the secrets of clairvoyance, thought
reading, and telepa- thy; they could swallow fire or glass unhurt, pass
through fire unburnt, walk upon water, fly through the air, and
transport themselves over great distances in a moment’s time. Abu Said
reports feats of mind reading as startling as any in current
mythography. 92 Day by day the religion that some philosophers supposed
to be the product of priests is formed and re-formed by the needs,
sentiment, and imagination of the people; and the mono- theism of the
prophets becomes the polytheism of the populace.</p>
<p>Orthodox Islam accepted Sufism within the Moslem fold, and gave it
considerable latitude of expression and belief. But this shrewd policy
was refused to heresies that concealed revolutionary politics, or
preached an anarchism of morality and law. Of many half-religious
half-political re- volts the most effective was that of the “Ismaila.”
In Shia doctrine, it will be recalled, each generation of Ali’s
descendants, to the twelfth, was headed by a divine incarnation or Imam,
and each Imam named his successor. The sixth, Jafar al-Sadiq, appointed
his eldest son Ismail to succeed him; Ismail, it is alleged, indulged in
wine; Jafar rescinded his nomination, and chose an- other son, Musa, as
seventh Imam (c. 760). Some Shi‘ites held the appoint - ment of Ismail
to be irrevocable, and honored him or his son Muhammad as seventh and
last Imam. For a century these “Ismailites” remained a negligible sect;
then Abdallah ibn Qaddah made himself their leader, and sent mission-
aries to preach the doctrine of the “Seveners” throughout Islam. Before
initiation into the sect the convert took an oath of secrecy, and
pledged ab- solute obedience to the Dai-d-Duat, or Grand Master of the
order. The teaching was divided into exoteric and esoteric: the convert
was told that after passing through nine stages of initiation all veils
would be removed, the Talim or Secret Doctrine (that God is All) would
be revealed to him, and he would then be above every creed and every
law. In the eighth degree of initiation the convert was taught that
nothing can be known of the Supreme Being, and no worship can be
rendered Him. 93 Many survivors of old com- munistic movements were
drawn to the Ismaila by the expectation that a Mahdi or Redeemer would
come, who would establish a regime of equality, justice, and brotherly
love on the earth. This remarkable confraternity be- came in time a
power in Islam. It won North Africa and Egypt, and founded the Fatimid
dynasty; and late in the ninth century it gave birth to a move- ment
that almost brought an end to the Abbasid caliphate.</p>

<p>ibn al-Ashrath, popularly known as Qarmat, became the leader of the
Ismaili sect, and gave it such energy that for a time in Asia it was
called, after him, Qaramita, the Carmathians. Planning to overthrow the
Arabs and restore the Persian Empire, he secretly enlisted thousands of
supporters, and persuaded them to contribute a fifth of their property
and income to a common treas- ury. Again an element of social revolution
entered into what was ostensibly a form of mystical religion: the
Carmathians advocated a communism of both property and women, 04
organized workmen into guilds, preached uni- versal equality, and
adopted an allegorical freethinking interpretation of the Koran. They
disregarded the rituals and fasts prescribed by orthodoxy, and laughed
at the “asses” who offered worship to shrines and stones. 95 In 899 they
established an independent state on the west shore of the Persian Gulf;
in 900 they defeated the caliph’s army, leaving hardly a man o f it
alive; in 902 they ravaged Syria to the gates of Damascus; in 924 they
sacked Basra, then Kufa; in 930 they plundered Mecca, slew 30,000
Moslems, and carried off rich booty, including the veil of the Kaaba and
the Black Stone itself.* The movement exhausted itself in its successes
and excesses; citizens united against its threat to property and order;
but its doctrines and violent ways were passed on in the next century to
the Ismaili of Alamut — the hashish-inspired Assassins.</p>

<li>LITERATURE</li>
</ol>
<p>In Islam life and religion had drama, but literature had none; it is
a form apparently alien to the Semitic mind. And as in other medieval
literatures, there was here no novel. Most writing was heard rather than
silently read; and those who cared for fiction could not rise to the
concentration necessary for a complex and continued narrative. Short
stories were as old as Islam or Adam; the simpler Moslems listened to
them with the ardor and appetite of children, but the scholars never
counted them as literature. The most popular of these stories were the
Fables of Bidpai and the Thousand Nights and a Night. The Fables were
brought to Persia from India in the sixth century, were translated into
Pahlavi, and thence, in the eighth century, into Arabic. The Sanskrit
original was lost, the Arabic version survived, and was rendered into
forty languages.</p>
<p>Al-Masudi (d. 597) speaks in his Meadows of Gold 98 of a Persian book
Hazar Afsana, or Thousand Tales, and of its Arabic translation, Alf
Laylah wa Laylah; this is the earliest known mention of The Thousand
Nights and a Night. The plan of the book as described by al-Masudi was
that of our Arabian Nights; such a framework for a series of stories was
already old in India. A great number of these tales circulated in the
Oriental world; various collections might differ in their selection, and
we are not sure that any story</p>

<p>in our present editions appeared in the texts known to al-Masudi.
Shortly after 1 700 an incomplete Arabic manuscript, not traceable
beyond 1536, was sent from Syria to the French Orientalist Antoine
Galland. Fascinated by their whimsical fantasy, their glimpses of
intimate Moslem life, perhaps by their occasional obscenity, he issued
at Paris in 1704 their first European translation — Les mille et une
milts. The book succeeded beyond any expecta- tion; translations were
made into every European language; and children of all nations and ages
began to talk of Sinbad the Sailor, Aladdin’s lamp, and Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves. Next to the Bible (itself Oriental), the Fables and the
Nights are the most widely read books in the world.</p>
<p>Literary prose, in Islam, is a form of poetry. The Arabic temperament
was inclined to strong feeling; Persian manners made for ornate speech;
and the Arabian language, then common to both peoples, invited rhyme by
the sim- ilarity of its inflectional endings. So literary prose usually
rhymed; preachers and orators and storytellers used rhymed prose; it was
in this medium that Badi al-Hamadhani (d. 1008) wrote his famous Maqamat
(Assemblies) — tales told to various gatherings about a wandering
rapscallion with less morals than wit. The peoples of the Near East were
ear-minded, as were all men before printing; to most Moslems literature
was a recited poem or narrative. Poems were written to be read aloud or
sung; and everyone in Islam, from peasant to caliph, heard them gladly.
Nearly everyone, as in samurai Japan, composed verses; in the educated
classes it was a popular game for one person to finish in rhyme a
couplet or stanza begun by another, or to compete in forming extempore
lyrics or poetic epigrams. Poets rivaled one another in fashioning
complex patterns of meter and rhyme; many rhymed the middle as well as
the end of a line; a riot of rhyme scurried through Arab verse, and
influenced the rise of rhyme in European poetry.</p>
<p>Probably no civilization or period — not even China in the days of Li
Po and Tu Fu, nor Weimar when it had “a hundred citizens and ten
thousand poets”— ever equaled Abbasid Islam in the number and prosperity
of its bards. Abul-Faraj of Isfahan (897-967), toward the end of this
age, collected and recorded Arabic poetry in his Kitab al-Aghani (Book
of Songs ) ; its twenty volumes suggest the wealth and variety of Arabic
verse. Poets served as propagandists, and were feared as deadly
satirists; rich men bought praise by the meter; and caliphs gave high
place and fat sums to poets who turned for them a pleasant stanza, or
celebrated the glory of their deeds or their tribe. The Caliph Hisham,
wishing to recall a poem, sent for the poet Hammad, who luckily
remembered it all; Hisham rewarded him with two slave girls and 50,000
dinars (37,500) ; 97 no poet will believe the tale. Arabic poetry, which
once had sung to Bedouins, now addressed itself to courts and palaces;
much of it became artificial, formal, delicately trivial, politely
insincere; and a battle of ancients and moderns ensued in which the
critics complained that there were great poets only before Mohammed.

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>Love and war outbid religion as poetic themes. The poetry of the
Arabs (this would not be true of the Persians) was seldom mystical; it
preferred songs of battle, passion, or sentiment; and as the century of
conquest closed, Eve overcame both Mars and Allah as the inspiration of
Arab verse. The poets of Islam thrilled with autointoxication in
describing the charms of woman — her fragrant hair, jewel eyes, berry
lips, and silver limbs. In the deserts and holy cities of Arabia the
troubadour motifs took form; poets and philosophers spoke of adab as, in
one phase, the ethic and etiquette of love; this tradition would pass
through Egypt and Africa to Sicily and Spain, and thence to Italy and
Provence; and hearts would break in rhyme and rhythm and many
tongues.</p>
<p>Hasan ibn Hani won the name of Abu Nuwas — “Father of the Curl”— from
his abounding locks. Born in Persia, he found his way to Baghdad, be-
came a favorite of Harun, and may have had with him one or two of the
adventures ascribed to them in the Thousand Nights and a Night. He loved
wine, woman, and his songs; offended the Caliph by too conspicuous
toping, agnosticism, and lechery; was often imprisoned and often
released; came by leisurely stages to virtue, and ended by carrying
beads and the Koran with him everywhere. But the society of the capital
liked best the hymns that he had written to wine and sin:</p>
<p>Come, Suleiman! sing to me,</p>
<p>And the wine, quick, bring to me!…</p>
<p>While the flask goes twinkling round,</p>
<p>Pour me a cup that leaves me drowned</p>
<p>With oblivion — ne’er so nigh</p>
<p>Let the shrill muezzin cry! 99</p>
<p>Accumulate as many sins as thou canst:</p>
<p>The Lord is ready to relax His ire.</p>
<p>When the Day comes, forgiveness thou wilt find</p>
<p>Before a mighty King and gracious Sire;</p>
<p>And gnaw thy fingers, all that joy regretting</p>
<p>Which thou didst leave through terror of hell-fire. 100</p>
<p>The minor courts had their poets too, and Sayfu’l -Dawla provided a
place for one who, almost unknown to Europe, is reckoned by the Arabs as
their best. His name was Ahmad ibn Husein, but Islam remembers him as
al- Mutannabi — “the pretender to prophecy.” Bom at Kufa in 915, he
studied at Damascus, announced himself as a prophet, was arrested and
released, and settled down at the Aleppo court. Like Abu Nuwas, he made
his own religion, and notoriously neglected to fast or pray or read the
Koran; 101 though he denounced life as not quite up to his standards, he
enjoyed it too much to think of eternity. He celebrated Sayfu’s
victories with such zest and verbal artifice’ that his poems are as
popular in Arabic as they are untrans- latable into English. One couplet
proved mortal to him:</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>I am known to the horse- troop, the night, and the desert’s
expanse;</p>
<p>Not more to paper and pen than to sword and the lance.</p>
<p>Attacked by robbers, he wished to flee; his slave inopportunely
reminded him of these swashbuckling verses; al-Mutannabi resolved to
live up to them, fought, and died of his wounds (965). 102</p>
<p>Eight years later the strangest of all Arab poets, Abu’l - ’Ala
al-Ma^rri was born at al- Ma‘arratu, near Aleppo. Smallpox left him
blind at four; never - theless he took up the career of a student,
learned by heart the manuscripts that he liked in the libraries,
traveled widely to hear famous masters, and re- turned to his village.
During the next fifteen years his annual income was thirty dinars, some
twelve dollars a month, which he shared with servant and guide; his
poems won him fame, but as he refused to write encomiums, he nearly
starved. In 1008 he visited Baghdad, was honored by poets and schol-
ars, and perhaps picked up among the freethinkers of the capital some of
the skepticism that spices his verse. In 1010 he went back to al-
Ma‘arratu, be - came rich, but lived to the end with the simplicity of a
sage. He was a vege- tarian a Voutrance , avoiding not only flesh and
fowl, but milk, eggs, and honey as well; to take any of these from the
animal world, he thought, was rank robbery. On the same principle he
rejected the use of animal skins, blamed ladies for wearing furs, and
recommended wooden shoes. 103 He died at eighty-four; and a pious pupil
relates that 180 poets followed his funeral, and eighty-four savants
recited eulogies at his grave. 104</p>
<p>We know him now chiefly through the 1592 short poems called briefly
Luzumiyyat {Obligations ). Instead of discussing woman and war, like his
fellow poets, al- Ma‘arri deals boldly with the most basic questions:
Should we follow revelation, or reason? — Is life worth living? — Is
there a life after death? — Does God exist?… Every now and then the poet
professes his ortho- doxy; he warns us, however, that this is a
legitimate precaution against martyrdom, which was not to his taste: “I
lift my voice to utter lies absurd; but speaking truth my hushed tones
scarce are heard.” 105 He deprecates in - discriminate honesty: “Do not
acquaint rascals with the essence of your religion, for so you expose
yourself to ruin.” 100 In simple fact al -Ma^rri is a rationalist
agnostic pessimist.</p>
<p>Some hope that an Imam with prophet’s gaze</p>
<p>Will rise and all the silent ranks amaze.</p>
<p>Oh, idle thought! There’s no Imam but Reason</p>
<p>To point the morning and the evening ways….</p>
<p>Shall we in these old tales discover truth,</p>
<p>Or are they worthless fables told to youth?</p>
<p>Our reason swears that they are only lies,</p>
<p>And reason’s tree bears verity for truth….</p>

<p>He denounces the Moslem divines who “make religion serve the pelf of
man,” who “fill the mosque with terror when they preach,” but conduct
themselves no better than “some who drink to a tavern tune.” “You have
been deceived, honest man, by a cunning knave who preaches to the

<p>And though he disbelieves in resurrection,</p>

<p>The worst scoundrels, he thinks, are those who manage the holy places
in Mecca; they will do anything for money. He advises his hearers not to
waste their time in pilgrimage , 100 and to be content with one
world.</p>
<p>The body nothing feels when soul is flown;</p>

<p>We laugh, but inept is our laughter;</p>
<p>We should weep, and weep sore,</p>
<p>Who are shattered like glass, and thereafter</p>
<p>Remolded no more. 111</p>
<p>And h e concludes: “If by God’s decree I shall be made into a clay
pot that serves for ablutions, I am thankful and content.” 112 He
believes in a God omnipotent and wise, and “marveled at a physician who
denies the Creator</p>
<p>Why blame the world? The world is free</p>
<p>Of sin; the blame is yours and mine.</p>
<p>Grapes, wine, and drinker — these are three;</p>
<p>But who was at fault, I wonder — he</p>
<p>That pressed the grapes, or he that sipped the wine?</p>
<p>“I perceive,” he writes with Voltairean sarcasm, “that men are
naturally un - just to one another, but there is no doubt of the justice
of Him Who created injustice.” 114 And he breaks out into the angry
dogmatism of a Diderot:</p>
<p>O fool, awake! The rites ye sacred hold</p>
<p>Are but a cheat contrived by men of old,</p>
<p>Who lusted after wealth, and gained their lust,</p>
<p>And died in baseness — and their law is dust. 115</p>
<p>Offended by what seemed to him the lies and cruelties of men, al-
Ma‘arri became a pessimist recluse, the Timon of Islam. Since the evils
of society are due to the nature of man, reform is hopeless. 110 The
best thing is to live apart, to meet only a friend or two, to vegetate
like some placid, half -solitary ani-</p>

<p>He obeyed his own counsel, and wrote for himself the pithiest,
bitterest epitaph:</p>
<p>My sire brought this on me, but I on none. 119 *</p>
<p>We do not know how many Moslems shared the skepticism of al-Ma-
’arri; the revival of orthodoxy after his time served as a conscious or
uncon - scious censor of the literature transmitted to posterity, and,
as in Christen- dom, may mislead us into minimizing medieval doubt.
Al-Mutannabi and al- Ma‘arri marked the zenith of Arabic poetry; after
them the supremacy of theology and the silencing of philosophy drove
Arabic verse into the insin- cerity, artificial passion, and flowering
elegance of courtly and trivial lays. But at the same time the
resurrection of Persia and its self-liberation from Arab rule were
stirring the nation to a veritable renaissance. The Persian tongue had
never yielded to Arabic in the speech of the people; gradually, in the
tenth century, reflecting the political and cultural independence of the
Tabirid, Samanid, and Ghaznevid princes, it reasserted itself as the
language of government and letters, and became New or Modern Persian,
enriched itself with Arabic words, and adopted the graceful Arabic
script. Persia now broke out in magnificent architecture and lordly
poetry. To the Arab qasida or ode, qita or fragment, and ghazal or love
poem, the poets of Iran added the mathna r wi or poetic narrative, and
the rubai (pi. rubaiyyat) or quatrain. Everything in Persia —
patriotism, passion, philosophy, pederasty, piety — now blossomed into
verse.</p>
<p>This efflorescence began with Rudagi (d. 954), who improvised
poetry,</p>

There, a generation later, Prince Nuh ibn Mansur asked the poet Daqiqi
to put into verse the Khodainama, or Book of Kings , wherein Danishwar
(c. 651) had gathered the legends of Persia. Daqiqi had written a
thousand lines when he was stabbed to death by his favorite slave.
Firdausi completed the task, and became the Homer of Persia.</p>
<p>Abu’l -Qasim Mansur (or Hasan) was born at Tus (near Mashhad)
about</p>
<ol start="934" type="1">
<li>His father held an administrative post at the Samanid court, and be-
queathed to his son a comfortable villa at Bazh, near Tus. Spending his
leisure in antiquarian research, Abu’l -Qasim became interested in the
Khodainama , and undertook to transform these prose stories into a
national epic. He called his work Shahnama — book of the shahs — and, in
the fashion of the time, took a pen name, Firdausi (garden), perhaps
from the groves of his estate. After twenty-five years of labor he
finished the poem in its first form, and set out for Ghazni (999? ) ,
hoping to present it to the great and terrible Mahmud.</li>
</ol>
<p>An early Persian historian assures us that there were then “four
hundred poets in constant attendance on Sultan Mahmud.” 120 It should
have been an unsurpassable barrier, but Firdausi succeeded in
interesting the vizier, who brought the immense manuscript to the
Sultan’s attention. Mahmud (says one account) gave the poet comfortable
quarters in the palace, turned over to him reams of historical material,
and bade him incorporate these in the epic. All variations of the story
agree that Mahmud promised him a gold dinar (.70) for each couplet of
the revised poem. For an unknown time Firdausi labored; at last (
c. 1010) the poem reached its final form in 60,000 couplets, and was
sent to the Sultan. When Mahmud was about to remit the promised sum,
certain courtiers protested that it was too much, and added that
Firdausi was a Shi‘ite and Mutazilite heretic. Mahmud sent 60,000 silver
dirhems (0,000). The poet, in anger and scorn, divided the money between
a bath attendant and a sherbet seller, and fled to Herat. He hid for six
months in a bookseller’s shop till Mahmud’s agents, instructed to arrest
him, gave up the search. He found refuge with Shariyar, prince of
Shirzad in Tabari- stan; there he composed a bitter satire on Mahmud;
but Shariyar, fearful of the Sultan, bought the poem for 100,000
dirhems, and destroyed it. If we may believe these figures, and our
equivalents, poetry was one of the most lucrative professions in
medieval Persia. Firdausi went to Baghdad, and there wrote a long
narrative poem, Yusuf and Zuleika , a variant of the story of Joseph and
Potiphar’s wife. Then, an old man of seventy -six, he returned to Tus.
Ten years later Mahmud, struck by the vigor of a couplet that he heard
quoted, asked the author’s name; when he learned that it was by Firdausi
he regretted his failure to reward the poet as promised. He des- patched
to Firdausi a caravan carrying 60,000 gold dinars’ worth of indigo,</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 269</p>
<p>and a letter of apology. As the caravan entered Tus it encountered
the poet’s funeral (1020?).</p>
<p>The Shahnama is one of the major works of the world’s literature, if
only in size. There is something noble in the picture of a poet putting
aside trivial subjects and easy tasks, and giving thirty-five years of
his life to telling his country’s story in 120,000 lines— far exceeding
the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. Here was an old man
mad about Persia, enamored of every detail in its records, whether
legend or fact; his epic is half finished before it reaches history. He
begins with the mythical figures of the Avesta, tells of Gayamurth, the
Zoroastrian Adam, and then of Gayamurth’s mighty</p>
<p>grandson Jamshid, who “reigned over the land 700 years The world
was</p>
<p>happier because of him; death was unknown, neither sorrow nor pain.”
But after a few centuries “his heart was lifted up with pride, and he
forgot whence came his weal He beheld only himself on the earth, called
him-</p>
<p>self God, and sent forth his image to be worshiped.” 121 At last we
come to the hero of the epic, Rustam, son of the feudal noble Zal. When
Rustam is 500 years old Zal falls in love with a slave girl, and through
her gives Rustam a brother. Rustam serves and saves three kings, and
retires from military life at the age of 400. His faithful steed Rakhsh
ages as leisurely, is almost as great a hero, and receives from Firdausi
the affectionate attention bestowed by any Persian upon a fine horse.
There are pretty love stories in the Shahnama , and something of the
troubadour’s reverence for woman; there</p>
<p>The strong emotion choked her panting breath,</p>
<p>Her veins seemed withered by the cold of death.</p>
<p>The trembling matrons hastening round her mourned,</p>
<p>With piercing cries, till fluttering life returned.</p>
<p>Then gazing up, distraught, she wept again,</p>
<p>And frantic, seeing ’midst her pitying train</p>

<p>The favorite steed — now more than ever dear,</p>
<p>Its limbs she kissed, and bathed with many a tear;</p>
<p>Clasping the mail Sohrab in battle wore,</p>
<p>With burning lips she kissed it o’er and o’er;</p>
<p>His martial robes she in her arms compressed,</p>
<p>And like an infant strained them to her breast. 123</p>
<p>It is a vivid narrative, moving rapidly from episode to episode, and
finding unity only from the unseen presence of the beloved fatherland in
every line. We — who have less leisure than men had before so many
labor-saving de- vices were invented — cannot spare the time to read all
these couplets and bury all these kings; but which of us has read every
line of the Iliad, or the Aeneid, or The Divine Comedy, or Paradise Lost
? Only men of epic stomach can digest these epic tales. After 200 pages
we tire of Rustam’s victories over demons, dragons, magicians, Turks.
But we are not Persians; we have not heard the sonorous roll of the
original verse; we cannot be moved as Persians are, who in a single
province have named 300 villages after Rustam. In 1934 the educated
world of Asia, Europe, and the Americas joined in commemo- rating the
millennial anniversary of the poet whose massive book has been for a
thousand years the bulwark of the Persian soul.</p>

<li>ART *</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Arabs invaded Syria their sole art was poetry. Mohammed was
believed to have forbidden sculpture and painting as accomplices of
idolatry — and music, rich silks, gold and silver ornaments as epicurean
degeneracy; and though all these prohibitions were gradually overcome,
they almost confined Moslem art in this period to architecture, pottery,
and decoration. The Arabs themselves, so recently nomads or merchants,
had no mature facility in art; they recognized their limitations, and
employed the artists and artisans — adapted the art forms and traditions
— of Byzantium, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Iran, and India. The Dome of
the Rock at Jerusalem and the Mosque of Walid II at Damascus were purely
Byzantine, even in their decoration. Farther east the old Assyrian and
Babylonian tile decora- tion, and current Armenian and Nestorian church
forms, were adopted; and in Persia, after much destruction of Sasanian
literature and art, Islam saw the advantages of the column cluster, the
pointed arch, the vault, and those styles of floral and geometrical
ornament which finally flowered into the arabesque. The result was no
mere imitation, but a brilliant synthesis that justified all borrowing.

<p>in India, Islamic art overrode all limits of place and time, laughed
at distinc- tions of race and blood, developed a unique and yet varied
character, and expressed the human spirit with a profuse delicacy never
surpassed.</p>
<p>Moslem architecture, like most architecture in the Age of Faith, was
al- most entirely religious; the dwellings of men were designed for
brief mor- tality, but the house of God was to be, at least internally,
a thing of beauty forever. Nevertheless, though the remains are scant,
we hear of bridges, aqueducts, fountains, reservoirs, public baths,
fortresses, and turreted walls built by engineer-architects who in the
first centuries after the Arab con- quest were in many cases Christian,
but in after centuries were predomi- nantly Moslem. The Crusaders found
excellent military architecture at Aleppo, Baalbek, and elsewhere in the
Islamic East, learned there the uses of machicolated walls, and took
from their foes many an idea for their own incomparable castles and
forts.The Alcazar at Seville and the Alhambra at Granada were fortresses
and palaces combined.</p>
<p>Of Umayyad palaces little survives except a country house at Qusayr
Amra in the desert east of the Dead Sea, where the ruins show vaulted
baths and frescoed walls. The palace of Adud ad-Dawla at Shiraz, we are
assured, had 360 rooms, one for each day in the year, each painted in a
unique color combination; one of its largest rooms was a library two
stories high, arcaded and vaulted; “there was no book on any subject,”
says an enthusiastic Mos - lem, “of which there was not here a copy.”
124 Scheherazade’s descriptions of Baghdad mansions are fiction, but
suggest an ornate magnificence of internal decoration. 125 Rich men had
villas in the country as well as homes in the city; even in the city
they had formal gardens; but around their villas these gardens became
“paradises”— parks with springs, brooks, fountains, tiled pool, rare
flowers, shade, fruit, and nut trees, and usually a pavilion for
enjoying the open air without the glare of the sun. In Persia there was
a religion of flowers; rose festivals were celebrated with sumptuous
displays; the roses of Shiraz and Firuzabad were world famous; roses
with a hundred petals were gifts grateful to a caliph or a king. 126</p>
<p>The houses of the poor were then, as they are now, rectangles of
sun-dried brick cemented with mud, and roofed with a mixture of mud,
stalks, branches, palm leaves, and straw. Better homes had an interior
court with a water basin, perhaps a tree; sometimes a wooden colonnade
and cloister be- tween court and rooms. Houses rarely faced or opened
upon the street; they were citadels of privacy, built for security and
peace. Some had secret doors for sudden escape from arrest or attack, or
for the inconspicuous entry of a paramour. 127 In all but the poorest
houses there were separate quarters for the women, occasionally with
their own court. Rich houses had a compli- cated suite of bathrooms, but
most dwellings had no plumbing; water was carried in, waste was carried
out. Fashionable homes might have two stories, with a central living
room rising to a dome, and a second-story balcony</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>facing the court. All except the poorest houses had at least one
window grille ( mashrabiyyah ), a lattice of woodwork to let in light
without heat, and allow the occupants to look out unseen; these grilles
were often elegantly carved, and served as models for the stone or metal
screens that adorned the palace or the mosque. There was no fireplace;
heat was provided by charcoal-burning portable braziers. Walls were of
plaster, usually painted in many colors. Floors were covered with hand-
woven rugs. There might be a chair or two, but the Moslem preferred to
squat. Near the wall, on three sides of the room, the floor was raised a
foot or so, forming a diivan, and was furnished with cushions.There were
no specific bedrooms; the bed was a mattress which, during the day, was
rolled up and placed in a closet, as in modern Japan. Furniture was
simple: some vases, utensils, lamps, and per- haps a niche for books.
The Oriental is rich in the simplicity of his needs.</p>
<p>For the poor and pious Moslem it was enough that the mosque itself
should be beautiful. It was built with his labor and dirhems; it
gathered up his arts and crafts and laid them like a rich carpet at
Allah’s feet; and that</p>
<p>The most brilliant and varied decoration was reserved for the
interior of the mosque: mosaics and brilliant tiles on floor and mihrab;
exquisite shapes</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 273</p>
<p>and hues of glass in windows and lamps; rich carpets and prayer rugs
on the pavement; facings of colored marble for the lower panels of the
walls; lovely friezes of Arabic script running round mihrabs or
cornices; delicate carv- ings of wood or ivory, or graceful molding of
metal, in doors, ceilings, pul- pits, and screens…. The pulpit itself,
or minbar , was of wood carefully carved, and inlaid with ebony or
ivory. Near it was the diqqa, a reading desk supported by small columns
and holding the Koran; the book itself, of course, was a work of
calligraphic and miniaturist art. To show the qibla or direction of
Mecca, a niche was cut into the wall, possibly in imitation of the
Christian apse. This mihrab was elaborated until it became almost an
altar or chapel, and all the skill of Moslem artists was deployed to
make it beautiful with faience or mosaic, floral or scriptural moldings
or reliefs, and colorful patterns in brick, stucco, marble, terra cotta,
or tile.</p>
<p>We probably owe this splendor of ornament to the Semitic prohibition
of human or animal forms in art: as if in compensation, the Moslem
artist invented or adopted an overflowing abundance of
non-representational forms. He sought an outlet first in geometrical
figures — line, angle, square, cube, polygon, cone, spiral, ellipse,
circle, sphere; he repeated these in a hun- dred combinations, and
developed them into swirls, guilloches, reticulations, entrelacs , and
stars; passing to floral forms, he designed, in many materials, wreaths,
vines, or rosettes of lotus, acanthus, or palm tendrils or leaves; in
the tenth century he merged all these in the arabesque; and to them all,
as a unique and major ornament, he added the Arabic script. Taking
usually the Kufic characters, he lifted them vertically, or expanded
them laterally, or dressed them in flourishes and points, and turned the
alphabet into a work of art. As religious prohibitions slackened, he
introduced new motifs of decoration by representing the birds of the
air, the beasts of the field, or strange composite animals that dwelt
only in his whimsical fantasy. His flair for adornment enriched every
form of art — mosaic, miniature, pottery, tex- tiles, rugs; and in
nearly every case the design had the disciplined unity of a dominant
form or motif developed from center to border, or from begin- ning to
end, as in the elaboration of a musical theme. No material was thought
too obdurate for such ornament; wood, metal, brick, stucco, stone, terra
cotta, glass, tile, and faience became the vehicles of such a poetry of
abstract forms as no art, not even the Chinese, had ever achieved
before.</p>
<p>So illuminated, Islamic architecture raised in Arabia, Palestine,
Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, Transoxiana, India, Egypt, Tunisia, Sicily,
Morocco, and Spain an endless chain of mosques in which masculine
strength of out- ward form was always balanced by feminine grace and
delicacy of interior ornament. The mosques of Medina, Mecca, Jerusalem,
Ramleh, Damascus, Kufa, Basra, Shiraz, Nishapur, and Ardebil; the Mosque
of Jafar at Bagh- dad, the Great Mosque of Samarra, the Zakariyah Mosque
of Aleppo, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun and the el-Azhar in old Cairo, the
Great Mosque of</p>
<p>274 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Tunis, the Sidi Oqba Mosque of Qairuan, the Blue Mosque of Cordova —
we can do no less, and no more, than name them, for of the hundreds such
that were built in this period only a dozen remain distinguishable;
indis- criminate time has leveled the rest through earthquake,
negligence, or war.</p>
<p>Persia alone — a fraction of Islam — has yielded to recent research
such un- suspected architectural splendor as marks a major event in our
rediscovery of the past.* The revelation was too long delayed; already
many master- pieces of Persian architecture had crumbled to earth.
Muqaddasi ranked the mosque of Fasa with that of Medina, and the mosque
of Turshiz with the Great Mosque of Damascus; the mosque of Nishapur,
with its marble col- umns, gold tiles, and richly carved walls, was one
of the wonders of the time; and “no mosque in Khurasan or Sistan equaled
in beauty” the mosque of Herat. 132 We may vaguely judge the exuberance
and quality of Persian architecture in the ninth and tenth centuries
from the stucco reliefs and carved columns and capitals of the mihrab in
the Congregational Mosque at Nayin, now mostly destroyed, and the two
lovely minarets that survive at Damghan. The Friday Mosque at Ardistan
(1055) still shows a handsome mihrab and portal, and many elements that
were to appear later in Gothic: pointed arches, groined pendentives,
cross vaults, and ribbed dome. 133 In these and most Persian mosques and
palaces the building material was brick, as in Sumerian and Mesopotamian
antiquity; stone was rare and costly, clay and heat were plentiful; yet
the Persian artist transformed brick layers with light and shade, novel
patterns, and divers attitudes into such variety of decoration as that
modest substance had never known before. Over the brick, in special
places like portals, minbars, and mihrabs, the Persian potter laid
varicolored mosaics and the most brilliant tiles; and in the eleventh
cen- tury he made bright surfaces more resplendent still with
luster-painted faience. So every art in Islam humbly and proudly served
the mosque.</p>
<p>Sculpture, forbidden to make statues lest idolatry return, devoted
itself to decorative reliefs. Stone was skillfully carved, and stucco,
before it hard- ened, was shaped by hand into a rich diversity of
designs. One impressive sample remains. At Mshatta, in the Syrian desert
east of the Jordan, Walid II began ( c. 743), and left unfinished, a
winter palace; along the lower surface of the fagade ran a sculptured
stone frieze of extraordinary excellence — tri- angles, rosettes, and
borders intricately carved with flowers, fruits, birds, beasts, and
trailing arabesques; this chef- d’oeuvre, transferred to Berlin in 1904,
has survived the Second World War. Woodworkers beautified win- dows,
doors, screens, balconies, ceilings, tables, lecterns, pulpits, and
mihrabs with such exquisite carving as may be seen in a panel from
Takrit</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1925 Reza Khan, afterwards Shah of Persia, authorized Arthur
Upham Pope to enter the mosques of Persia, which had been closed to
non-Moslems, in order to photograph the interiors. The result was an
epochal revelation of the technical and artistic excellence of Persian
architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 275</p>
<p>in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Workers in ivory and
bone adorned mosques, Korans, furniture, utensils, and persons with
carv- ings and inlays; from this age only one piece has come to us — an
elephant rook (in the National Museum at Florence) precariously ascribed
to the ninth century and to a chess set allegedly sent by Harun to
Charlemagne. 134 The metalworkers of Islam acquired Sasanian techniques,
made great bronze, brass, dr copper lamps, ewers, bowls, jugs, mugs,
cups, basins, and braziers; cast them playfully into the forms of lions,
dragons, sphinxes, peacocks, and doves; and sometimes incised them with
exquisite patterns, as in a lacelike lamp in the Art Institute of
Chicago. Some craftsmen filled incised designs with silver or gold, and
made “damascened” metal— an art practiced, but not originated, at
Damascus. 133 The swords of Damascus were of highly tempered steel,
adorned with reliefs or inlaid with arabesques, scripts, or other
patterns in gold or silver threads. The metalworkers of Islam stood at
the very top of their art.</p>
<p>When the Moslem conquest settled down to cultural absorption, Moham-
medan pottery found itself heir, in Asia, Africa, and Spain, to five
ceramic traditions: Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Mesopotamian, Persian,
Chinese. Sarre discovered at Samarra some Tang pottery, including
porcelain; and early Islamic-Persian wares were frankly copied from
Chinese prototypes. Pottery centers developed at Baghdad, Samarra, Rayy,
and many other towns. By the tenth century Persian potters were making
almost every kind of pot- tery except porcelain, in every form from hand
spittoons to monstrous vases “large enough to hold at least one of the
Forty Thieves.” 136 At its best Persian pottery showed a subtlety of
conception, a splendor of color, a re- finement of workmanship, second
only to the Chinese and Japanese; for six centuries it had no rival this
side of the Pamirs. 137 It was a favorite and con- genial art with the
Persians; aristocrats collected its masterpieces jealously, and poets
like al- Ma‘ arri and Omar Khayyam found in it many a metaphor for their
philosophy. We hear of a ninth-century banquet at which poems were
composed and dedicated to the bowls that adorned the board. 138</p>
<p>In that century the potters of Samarra and Baghdad distinguished
them- selves by making — perhaps inventing — lustered pottery: the
decoration was painted in a metallic oxide upon the glazed coating of
the clay, and the vessel was then submitted to a smoky and subdued
second firing, which reduced the pigment to a thin layer of metal, and
gave the glaze an iridescent glow. Lovely monochromes were produced in
this manner, and still lovelier poly- chromes in gold, green, brown,
yellow, and red, in a hundred almost fluid tints. The luster technique
was applied also to the ancient Mesopotamian art of decorative tiles.
The rich colors of these squares, and their harmonious combinations,
gave unique splendor jto the portals or mihrabs of a hundred mosques,
and to many a palace wall. In the allied art of working glass the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>Moslems inherited all the skill of Egypt and Syria. Brilliant lamp
shades were made in glass adorned with medallions, inscriptions, or
floral designs; and perhaps in this period Syria inaugurated ~the art of
enameled glass, which would reach its peak of excellence in the
thirteenth century.</p>
<p>When we recall the exuberant and omnipresent use of painting and
sculp- ture in Catholic cathedrals, and its importance as a vehicle of
Christian creed and story, we are struck by the absence of the
representative arts in Islam. The Koran had forbidden sculpture (v, 92),
but it had said nothing about painting. However, a tradition ascribed to
Aisha reported the Prophet as condemning pictures too. 139 Moslem law,
Shi’ite as well as Sunnite, enforced the double prohibition. Doubtless
Mohammed had been influenced by the Second Commandment and Judaic
teaching, and partly by the notion that the artist, in giving form to
living things, usurped the function of the Cre- ator. Some theologians
relaxed the prohibition, permitting pictures of inani- mate things; some
winked at the portrayal of animal or human figures on objects intended
only for secular use. Certain Umayyad caliphs ignored the prohibitions;
about 712 Walid I adorned his summer palace at Qusayr Amra with
Hellenistic frescoes depicting hunters, dancing girls, women bathing,
and himself on his throne. 140 The Abbasid caliphs professed piety, but
had murals in their private chambers; al-Mutasim hired artists, probably
Chris- tian, to paint hunting scenes, priests, and naked dancing girls
on the walls of his palace at Samarra; and al-Mutawakkil, who persecuted
heretics, permitted Byzantine painters to add to these frescoes one that
represented Christian monks and a Christian church. 141 Mahmud of Ghazni
decorated his palace with pictures of himself, his armies, and his
elephants; and his son Masud, shortly before being deposed by the Seljuq
Turks, covered the walls of his chambers at Herat with scenes based on
Persian or Indian manuals of erotic techniques. 142 A story tells how,
at the home of a vizier, two artists vied with each other in realistic
representation: Ibn Aziz proposed to paint a dancing girl so that she
would seem to be coming out of the wall; al-Qasir undertook a harder
task — to paint her so that she would seem to be going into the wall.
Each succeeded so well that the vizier gave them robes of honor, and
much gold. 143 Many other violations of the interdict could be listed;
in Persia particularly we find living things pictured in joyous
abundance, and in every form of pictorial art. Nevertheless the
prohibition — supported by the people to the point of occasionally
mutilating or de- stroying works of art — delayed the development of
Islamic painting, largely restricted it to abstract ornament, almost
excluded portraiture (yet we hear of forty portraits of Avicenna), and
left the artists completely dependent upon royal or aristocratic
patronage.</p>
<p>From this age no Moslem murals survive save those of Qusayr Amra and
Samarra; they reveal a strange and barren marriage of Byzantine
techniques</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 277</p>
<p>with Sasanian designs. As if in compensation, Islamic miniatures are
among the finest in history. Here fruition came to a varied heritage —
Byzantine, Sasanian, and Chinese; and zealous hands carried on an art so
intimately beautiful that one almost resents Gutenberg. Like chamber
music in modem Europe, so in medieval Islam the illumination of
manuscripts with miniature paintings was an art for the aristocratic
few; only the rich could maintain an artist in the devoted poverty that
produced these patient masterpieces. Here again decoration subordinated
representation; perspective and model- ing were deliberately ignored; a
central motif or form — perhaps a geomet- rical figure or a single
flower — was extended in a hundred variations, until nearly every inch,
and even the border, of the page was filled with lines as carefully
drawn as if incised. In secular works men, women, and animals might be
introduced, in scenes of hunting, humor, or love; but always the
ornament was the thing, the fanciful play of delicate line, the liquid
flow of harmonious colors, the cool perfection of abstract beauty,
intended for a mind at peace. Art is significance rendered with feeling
through form; but the feeling must accept discipline, and the form must
have structure and meaning, even if the meaning outreach the realm of
words. This is the art of illumination, as of the profoundest music.</p>
<p>Calligraphy was an integral part of illumination; one must go as far
as China to find again so fraternal a union of writing and design. From
Kufa had come the Kufic letters, clumsily angular, crudely sharp; the
calligraphers clothed these meager bones with vowel, inflectional,
prosodic, diacritical marks, and little floral flourishes; so redeemed,
the Kufic script became a frequent feature of architectural decoration.
For cursive writing, however, the Naskhi form of the Arabic alphabet
proved more attractive; its rounded characters and sinuous horizontal
flow were of themselves a decoration; in all the world is no writing or
print that equals it in beauty. By the tenth century it had gained the
upper hand over Kufic in all but monumental or ceramic lettering; most
of the Moslem books that have reached us from the Middle Ages are in
Naskhi script. The majority of these surviving volumes are Korans.
Merely to copy the holy book was a work of piety sure of divine reward;
to illustrate it with pictures was accounted sacrilege; but to lavish
beautiful handwriting upon it was deemed the noblest of the arts.
Whereas miniaturists were hired artisans poorly paid, calligraphers were
sought and honored with royal gifts, and numbered kings and statesmen in
their ranks. A scrap of writing by a master’s hand was a priceless
treasure; already in the tenth century there were bibliophiles who lived
and moved and had their being in their collections of fine manuscripts,
written on parchment with inks of black, blue, violet, red, and gold.
Only a few such volumes have reached us from this age; the oldest is a
Koran in the Cairo Library, dated</p>

<p>many instances adorned with an elegant design, we may without
hyperbole rank Islamic books of the ninth to the eighteenth century as
the finest ever issued. Which of us can be published in such splendor
today?</p>
<p>In the embellishment of Islamic life all the arts mingled like the
interlaces of a decorative theme. So the patterns of illumination and
calligraphy were woven into textiles, burned into pottery, and mounted
on portals and mihrabs. If medieval civilization made little distinction
between artist and artisan it was not to belittle the artist but to
ennoble the artisan; the goal of every industry was to become an art.
The weaver, like the potter, made un- distinguished products for
ephemeral use; but sometimes his skill and pa- tience found expression,
his dream found form, in robes or hangings, rugs or coverings,
embroideries or brocades, woven for many lifetimes, designed with the
finesse of a miniature, and dyed in the gorgeous colors so favored of
the East. Byzantine, Coptic, Sasanian, Chinese textiles were already fa-
mous when the Moslems conquered Syria, Persia, Egypt, and Transoxiana;
Islam was quick to learn; and though the Prophet had proscribed silk,
Mos- lem factories soon issued the sinful substance in bold abundance
for men and women who sought forgiveness for their bodies as well as
their souls. A “robe of honor” was the most precious present a caliph co
uld offer his servi- tors. The Moslems became the leading silk merchants
of the medieval world. Persian silk taftah was bought for European
ladies as taffeta. Shiraz was fa- mous for its woolen cloths, Baghdad
for its baldachin* hangings and tabby silk s; Khuzistan for fabrics of
camel’s or goat’s hair; Khurasan for its sofa (Arabic suffah ) covers,
Tyre for its carpets, Bokhara for its prayer rugs, Herat for its gold
brocades. No samples of these products from this period have survived
the wear and tear of time; we can only surmise their excellence from
later work, and the witness of the writers of their age. An entry in the
archives of Harun al- Rashid notes “400,000 pieces of gold, the price of
a robe of honor for Jafar, the son of Yahya the Vizie r.” 144</p>

<li>MUSIC</li>
</ol>
<p>Music, like sculpture, was at first a sin in Islam. 145 It was not
forbidden in the Koran; but, if we may believe a dubious tradition, the
Prophet, fearful of the songs and dances of promiscuous women, denounced
musical instru- ments as the devil’s muezzin call to damnation. The
theologians, and all the four schools of orthodox law, frowned upon
music as raising the winds of passion; but some generously conceded that
it was not sinful in itself. The people, always healthier in their
conduct than in their creeds, held it as a</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>CHAP. XII) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM 279</p>
<p>proverb that “wine is as the body, music is as the soul, joy is their
off - spring.” 146 Music ac companied every stage of Moslem life, and
filled a thou- sand and one Arabian nights with songs of love and war
and death. Every palace, and many mansions, engaged minstrels to sing
the songs of the poets, or their own. In the startling judgment of an
historian fully competent to judge, “the cultivation of music by the
Arabs in all its branches reduces to insignificance the recognition of
the art in the history of any other coun- try.” 147 No Western ear,
except after long training, can quite apprecia te the quality of Arabian
music — its preference of melodic elaboration (arabesques of sound) to
harmony and counterpoint, its division of tones not into halves but into
thirds, its florid Oriental patterns of structure and rhythm. To us it
seems repetitiously simple, monotonously mournful, formlessly weird; to
the Arabs European music seems deficient in the number and subtlety of
its tones, and vulgarly addicted to useless complexity and monumental
noise. The meditative tenderness of Arabian music deeply affects the
Moslem soul. Sa’di speaks of a boy “singing such a plaintive melody as
would arrest a bird in its flight”; 148 al - Ghazali defined ecstasy as
“the state that comes from listening to music”; 149 one Arabic book
gives a chapter to those wh o fainted or died while listening to Moslem
music; and religion, which at first de- nounced it, later adopted music
for the intoxicating dervish ritual.</p>
<p>Moslem music began with ancient Semitic forms and tunes; developed in
contact with Greek “modes” t hat were themselves of Asiatic origin; and
felt strong influences from Persia and India. A musical notation, and
much musical theory, were taken from the Greeks; al-Kindi, Avicenna, and
the Brethren of Sincerity wrote at length on the subject; al-Farabi ’s
Grand Book on Music is the outstanding medieval production on the theory
of music — “equal, if not superior, to anything that has come down to us
from Greek sources.” 150 As early as the seventh century the Moslems
wrote mensurable music (apparently unknown to Europe before 1 1 90) 151
— their notation indi- cated the duration, as well as the pitch, of each
note.</p>
<p>Among a hundred musical instruments the chief were the lute, lyre,
pan- dore, psaltery, and flute, occasionally reinforced by horn,
cymbals, tambou- rine, castanets, and drum. The lyre was a small harp.
The lute was like our mandolin, with a long neck and a curved sounding
board made of small glued segments of maple wood; the strings, of
catgut, were plucked by the fingers. There were a dozen sizes and
varieties of lute. The large lute was called qitara from the Greek
kithara; our words guitar and lute (Arabic al-ud) are from the Arabic.
Some string instruments were played with a bow, and the organ was known
in both its pneumatic and its hydraulic forms. Certain Moslem cities,
like Seville, were celebrated for making fine musical instruments, far
superior to anything produced in contemporary Islam. 152 Nearly all
instru- mental music was intended to accompany or introduce song.
Performances</p>
<p>280 the age of faith (chap. XII</p>
<p>were usually confined to four or five instruments at a time, but we
also read of large orchestras; 153 and tradition ascribes to the Medina
musician Surayj the first use of the baton. 154</p>
<p>Despite the Moslem madness for music, the status of musicians, except
for renowned virtuosos, was low. Few men of the higher classes
condescended to study the intoxicating art. The music of a rich
household was provided by female slaves; and a school of law held that
the testimony of a musician could not be accepted in court. 155 Dancing
likewise was almost confined to slaves trained and hired; it was often
erotic, often artistic; the Caliph Amin personally directed an all-night
ballet in which a large number of girls danced and sang. Contact of the
Arabs with Greeks and Persians raised the status of the musician.
Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs showered largess upon the great performers
of their time. Suleiman I offered prizes as high as 20,000 pieces of
silver (0,000) for a competition among the musicians of Mecca; Walid II
held song tournaments, at one of which the first prize was 300,000
pieces of silver (50,000) ; 156 these figures are presumably Oriental
exaggerations. Mahdi invited to his court the Meccan singer Siyat,
“whose soul warmed and chilled more than a hot bath”; and Harun al
-Rashid took into his service Siyat’s pupil Ibrahim al -Mawsili (i.e.,
of Mosul), gave him 150,000 dirhems (5,000), 10,000 more per month, and
100,000 for a single song. 157 Harun so loved music that — against the
wont of his class — he encouraged the talent of his young half brother,
Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, who had a voice of tremen- dous power and three
octaves’ range; time seems an impish circle when we hear that he led a
kind of Romantic movement in Arabian music against the classical school
of Ishaq, son of Ibrahim al-Mawsili. 158 Ishaq was by general consent
the greatest musician ever produced by Islam. Al-Mamun used to say of
him: “He never sang to me but what I fe lt that my possessions were
increased.” 159</p>
<p>We get a pleasant picture of Moslem society, and of the stir made by
music in the Moslem soul, in a story told by Ibrahim al- Mawsili’s pupil
Mukhariq; we need not believe it to feel its significance:</p>
<p>After drinking with the Caliph a whole night, I asked his permis-</p>
<p>sion to take the air,… which he granted. While I was walking I saw a
damsel who appeared as if the rising sun beamed from her face. She had a
basket, and I followed her. She stopped at a fruiterer’s, and</p>
<p>bought some fruit; and observing that I was following her, she looked
back and abused me several times; but still I followed her until she ar-
rived at a great door…. When she had entered, and the door was</p>
<p>closed behind her, I sat down opposite to it, deprived of my reason
by her beauty…. The sun went down upon me while I sat there; and at
length there came two handsome young men on asses, and they</p>
<p>knocked at the door, and when they were admitted, I entered with</p>
<p>hem; the master of the house thinking that I was their companion,</p>
<p>28 i</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) THOUGHT AND ART IN EASTERN ISLAM</p>
<p>and they imagining that I was one of his friends. A repast was
brought us, and we ate, and washed our hands, and were perfumed. The
mas- ter of the house then said to the two young men, “Have ye any
desire that I should call such a one?” (mentioning a woman’s name).
They</p>
<p>answered: “If thou wilt grant us the favor, well.” So he called for
her, and she came, and lo, she was the maiden whom’ I had seen A
serv-</p>
<p>ant maid preceded her, bearing her lute, which she placed in her lap.
Wine was then brought, and she sang, while we drank and shook with
delight. “Whose air is that?” they asked. She answered, “My master</p>
<p>Mukhariq’s.” She then sang an other air, which she said was also
mine, while they drank by pints; she looking aside doubtfully at me
until I</p>
<p>lost my patience, and called out to her to do her best; but in
attempt- ing to do so, singing a third air, she overstrained her voice,
and I said, “Thou hast made a mistake”; upon which she threw the lute
from her lap in anger, saying… “Take it thyself, and let us hear thee.”
I an -</p>
<p>swered, “Well”; and having taken it and tuned it perfectly, I sang
the first of the airs which she had sung before me; whereupon all of
them sprang to their feet and kissed my head. I then sang the second
air, and the third; and their reason almost fled with ecstasy.</p>
<p>The master of the house, after asking his guests and being told
by</p>
<p>hem that they knew me not, came to me, and kissing my hand, said, “By
Allah, my master, who art thou?” I answered, “By Allah, I am the singer
Mukhariq.” “And for what purpose,” said he, kissing both my</p>
<p>hands, “earnest thou hither?” I replied, “As a sponger”— and I
related what had happened with respect to the maiden. Thereupon he
looked toward his two companions and said to them: “Tell me, by Allah,
do</p>
<p>ye not know that I gave for that girl 30,000 dirhems (5,000), and</p>
<p>have refused to sell her?” They answered, “It is so.” Then, said
he,</p>
<p>“I take you as witnesses that I have given her to him.” “And we,”
said the two friends, “will pay thee two - thirds of her price.” So he
put me in possession of the girl; and in the evening, when I departed,
he pre- sented me also with rich robes and other gifts, with all of
which I</p>
<p>went away. And as I passed the places where the maiden had abused me,
I said to her, “Repeat thy words to me”; but she would not for</p>
<p>shame. Holding the girl’s hand, I went with her to the Caliph, whom I
found in anger at my long absence; but when I related my story to</p>
<p>him he was surprised, and laughed, and ordered that the master of the
house and his two friends should be brought before him, that he might
requite them; to the former he gave 40,000 dirhems; to each of his two
friends 30,000; and to me 100,000; and I kissed his feet and departed.
