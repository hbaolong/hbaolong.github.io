<p>The Atheists</p>
<p>1 73 °- 5 1</p>
<p>I. THE PHILOSOPHIC ECSTASY</p>
<p>1 ET us define our terms. By philosopher we shall mean anyone who
tries to arrive at reasoned opinions on any subject whatever as seen in
a large perspective. More specifically, in these chapters, we shall
apply the term to those who seek a rational view of the origin, nature,
significance, and destiny of the universe, life, or man. Philosophy must
not be understood as in opposition to religion, and any large
perspective of human life must make room for religion. But since many
philosophers in eighteenth-century France were hostile to Christianity
as they knew it, the word philosophe took on an anti-Christian
connotation;* and usually, in our use of the French term, it will carry
that implication. So we shall call La Mettrie, Voltaire, Diderot,
d’Alembert, Grimm, Helvetius, and d’Holbach phi - losophes ; but we
shall not so term Rousseau — though we should call him a philosopher, if
only because he gave a reasoned argument in defense of feeling and
faith. We must also allow for the fact that a philosophe might oppose
all the religions around him, and yet, like Voltaire, consistently and
to the end profess belief in God. The debate that agitated the intel-
lectual classes in the half century before the Revolution was not quite
a conflict between religion and philosophy; it was primarily a conflict
between the philosophes and Catholic Christianity as it then existed in
France. It was the pent-up wrath of the French mind after centuries in
which religion had sullied its services with obscurantism, persecution,
and massacre. The reaction went to extremes, but so had the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew (1572), the assassination of Henry IV (1610), and the
dragonnades of the Revocation (1685).</p>
<p>Never had there been such a multitude of philosophers. Helvetius re-
marked “the taste of our age for philosophy,” 2 and d’Alembert
wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guillaume Francois Berthier, the brilliant Jesuit who edited the
Journal de Trevoux, noted in the issue of July, 1759: “The custom has
been established to call philosophe those who attack revealed religion,
and ‘persecutor’ those who battle for its defense.” 1</li>
</ul>
<p>605</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Our century has called itself the century of philosophy par
excel-</p>
<p>lence. . . . From the principles of the profane sciences to the
founda- tions of revelation, from metaphysics to questions of taste,
from music to morals, . . . from the rights of princes to those of
peoples, . . .</p>
<p>everything has been discussed, analyzed, disputed. . . . One
cannot</p>
<p>deny that philosophy among us has shown progress. Natural science
from day to day accumulates new riches. . . . Nearly all fields of</p>
<p>knowledge have assumed new forms . 3</p>
<p>The French philosophers were a new breed. First of all, they were
clear. They were not solemn recluses, talking to themselves or their
like in esoteric gibberish. They were men of letters, who knew how to
make thoughts shine through words. They turned their backs on
metaphysics as a hopeless quest, and on systems of philosophy as
pretentious vanities. They wrote not long convoluted treatises,
laboriously evolving the world from one idea, but relatively short
essays, diverting dialogues, novels sometimes spiced with obscenity,
satires that could slay with laughter, epigrams that could crush with a
line. These philosophers attuned their speech to the men and women of
the salons; in many cases they addressed their works to dis- tinguished
ladies; such books were bound to be intelligible, and might make atheism
charming. So philosophy became a social force, moving out of the schools
into society and government. It took part in the conflict of powers; it
was in the news. And since all educated Europe looked to France for the
latest notions, the works of the French philosophers reached into
England, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Sweden, and Russia, and became
Euro- pean events. Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great were
proud to be philo sophes, and perhaps they were not disturbed when
French con- servatives predicted that the freethinkers of France were
undermining her morals, unity, and power.</p>
<p>Gutenberg was having his effect: print was spreading science,
history, Biblical criticism, the pagan classics; the philosophers could
now speak to a larger and better-prepared audience than ever before.
They did not dis- dain to come down from their towers and “popularize”
knowledge. Not that they put much trust in the “common man” as they knew
him in that age; but they were confident that the dissemi nation of
“truth” would im - prove the conduct and happiness of mankind.
D’Alembert regarded “the art of instructing and enlightening men” as
“the noblest portion and gift within human reach .” 4 Sctpere crude —
“to dare to know”— became the motto of this eclaircissement, or
enlightenment, this Age of Reason triumphant and fulfilled.</p>
<p>For now the faith in reason, which had had its chanticleer in Francis
Bacon a century before, became the foundation and instrument of
“liberal” thought — i.e., in this aspect, thought liberated from the
myths of the Bible</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>6 07</p>
<p>and the dogmas of the Church. Reason appeared in all the glory of a
new revelation; it claimed authority henceforth in every field, and
proposed to re-form education, religion, morals, literature, economy,
and government in its own bright image. The philosophes admitted the
frailty of reason, as of everything human; they knew that it could be
deceived by bad logic or a mistaken interpretation of experience; and
they did not have to wait for Schopenhauer to tell them that reason is
usually the servant of desire, the handmaiden of the will. Hume, who
dominated this Age of Reason in Britain, was the strongest critic that
reason ever encountered, possibly ex- cepting Kant. Voltaire time and
again acknowledged the limits of reason, and Diderot agreed with
Rousseau that feeling is more basic than reason. Nearly all the
philosophers of the Enlightenment recognized that the majority of men,
even in the most civilized nation, are too pressed by economic
necessities and toil to have time for the development of reason, and
that the masses of mankind are moved far more by passion and preju- dice
than by reason. Even so, the hope remained that reason could be spread,
and could be freed from narrow selfishness and interested indoc-
trination.</p>
<p>And so, despite their periods of pessimism, a spirit of optimism
prevailed among the philosophes. Never had men been so confident that
they could remold, if not themselves, at least society. Despite the
disasters of the Seven Years’ War, despite the loss of Canada and India
to England, there rose in the second half of the eighteenth century an
elan of the mind that seemed to make old and ailing France young and
strong again. Not since the days of the Greek Sophists had there been so
many ideas in the air, or so invigorating a spirit of inquiry and
debate; no wonder Duclos sensed around him “a certain fermentation of
reason tending to develop every - where.” 3 And because Paris was now
the intellectual capital of Europe, the Enlightenment became as wide a
movement as the Renaissance and the Reformation. Indeed, it seemed the
logical culmination of the earlier move- ments. The Renaissance had gone
back beyond Christianity to explore the pagan mind; the Reformation had
broken the bonds of doctrinal authority, and, almost despite itself, had
let loose the play of reason. Now those two preludes to modernity could
complete themselves. Man could at last liberate himself from medieval
dogmas and Oriental myths; he could shrug off that bewildering,
terrifying theology, and stand up free, free to doubt, to in- quire, to
think, to gather knowledge and spread it, free to build a new religion
around the altar of reason and the service of mankind. It was a noble
intoxication.</p>
<p>6o8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE BACKGROUND OF REVOLT</li>
</ol>
<p>But how had all this come about? Why had so many philosophers, es-
pecially in France, turned against Christianity, which, after all, had
mingled hope with its terrors, charity with its crimes, beauty with its
sins?</p>
<p>In England the revolt, as expressed by the deists, had met with a
rela- tively tolerant hearing, even from the Established Church; and
perhaps for that reason the fire of revolt had died down. Moreover, the
Church in England was subject to the state, and no longer made any
active pretense to be a rival independent power. But in France the
Church was a powerful organization owning a large share of the national
wealth and soil, and yet bound by supreme allegiance to a foreign power.
It seemed to be draining more wealth from secular into ecclesiastical
hands through its role in the making of wills and the guidance of
bequests; it refused to pay taxes be- yond its occasional “gratuitous
gift”; it held thousands of peasants in prac - tical serfdom on its
lands; it maintained monks in what seemed to be fruitless idleness. It
had repeatedly profited from false documents and bogus miracles. It
controlled nearly all schools and universities, through which it
inoculated the minds of the young with stupefying absurdities. It de-
nounced as heresy any teaching contrary to its own, and used the state
to enforce its censorship over speech and press. It had done its best to
choke the intellectual development of France. It had urged Louis XIV
into the inhuman persecution of the Huguenots, and the heartless
destruction of Port-Royal. It had been guilty of barbarous campaigns
against the Al- bigenses, and of sanctioning massacres like that of
St. Bartholomew’s Day; it had fomented religious wars that had almost
ruined France. And amid all these crimes against the human spirit it had
pretended, and had made millions of simple people believe, that it was
above and beyond reason and questioning, that it had inherited a divine
revelation, that it was the infal- lible and divinely inspired
vicegerent of God, and that its crimes were as much the will of God as
were its charities.</p>
<p>The Church offered many answers to this indictment; we shall hear
them in due course. Meanwhile these proliferating charges moved
thousands of minds to resentment and protest, and finally to an
impassioned hostility. Skeptics multiplied to the point where they
ceased to fear the clergy, and openly harassed them with difficult
questions. When, about 1730, Father Toumemine, at the College
Louis-le-Grand, invited unbelievers to meet him, “his room,” we are
told, “was soon filled with freethinkers, deists, materialists; he
converted hardly any.” 6 The clergy were appalled at the number of
Frenchmen and Frenchwomen who died rejecting the sacra- ments of the
Church. Mme. de Prie threatened to have her servants throw</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) THE ATHEISTS 609</p>
<p>through the window the cure who importuned her to accept extreme unc-
tion. 7 A priest complained that “the moment we appear we are forced
into discussion. We are called upon to prove, for example, the utility
of prayer to a man who does not believe in God, and the necessity of
fasting to a man who has all his life denied the immortality of the
soul. The effort is very irksome, while those who laugh are not on our
side.” 8</p>
<p>Barbier remarked in 1751, “We may see in this country a revolution in
favor of Protestantism.” 9 He was mistaken. The expulsion of the Hugue -
nots had left no halfway house between Catholicism and unbelief. French
liberal thought skipped the Reformation, and went at one leap from the
Renaissance to the Enlightenment. So in France it was not to the
Jansenists or to the few surviving Protestants that the French mind
turned in its rebellion; it was to Montaigne, Descartes, Gassendi,
Bayle, and Montes- quieu. When the French freethinkers went back to
Descartes they rejected nearly all of him but his “methodic doubt” and
his mechanistic interpreta - tion of the objective world. Bayle was
honored as the subtlest of reasoners, whose doubts had generated a
thousand doubts more; his Dictionnaire was an inexhaustible armory for
the enemies of the Church.</p>
<p>The example of England was an emboldening inspiration to the free-
thinkers of France. First, Francis Bacon, whose call to inductive
science seemed to promise so much more fruit than Des cartes’ magical
deduction of God and immortality from the existence of Descartes. Then
Hobbes, whose blunt materialism never ceased to agitate Diderot. Then
Newton, who seemed to have reduced God to a button-presser in the world
machine; the French did not yet know that Newton was more prolific in
theology than in science. Then the English deists, who had given courage
and impetus to Voltaire. And finally Locke, for the French skeptics
thought that all religion collapsed before the proposition that all
ideas are derived from sensation. If sensation is a product of external
forces, mind is a prod- uct of experience, not a deathless gift of an
invisible God. And if ex-</p>
<p>perience creates character, character can be changed by altering
educational methods and content, and reforming social institutions. From
these two propositions men like Diderot, Helvetius, and d’Holbach drew
revolu - tionary conclusions. “Can there be anything more splendid,”
asked Vol - taire, with Locke in mind, “than to put the wh ole world
into commotion by a few arguments?” 10 (Voltaire died before 1789.)</p>
<p>Hear again the alert Marquis d’Argenson, writing in 1753:</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to attribute the loss of religion in France
to</p>
<p>the English philosophy, which has not gained more than a hundred</p>
<p>philosophes or so in Paris, instead of setting it down to the
hatred</p>
<p>against the priests, which goes to the very last extreme.</p>
<p>6lO THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>And he added, after that prediction of revolution which we have
already quoted:</p>
<p>It 〔the revolution〕 will be a very different thing from the
rude</p>
<p>Reformation — a medley of superstition and freedom that came to us
from Germany in the sixteenth century. As our nation and our</p>
<p>century are enlightened in so very different a fashion, they will
go</p>
<p>whither they ought to go: they will expel the priests, abolish the
priest- hood, and get rid of all revelation and all mystery. . . .</p>
<p>One may not speak in behalf of the clergy in social circles; one
is</p>
<p>scoffed at and regarded as a “familiar” 〔spy〕 of the Inquisition. .
. .</p>
<p>The priests remark that this year there is a diminution of more than
one third in the number of communicants. The college of the Jesuits is
being deserted; 120 boarders have been withdrawn from these so</p>
<p>greatly defamed monks . 11</p>
<p>There were other intellectual influences that weakened the medieval
creed. The philosophes joined with the orthodox in rejecting Spinoza,
for the great Jew had been labeled atheist, and it was dangerous to
speak of him without denouncing him, as Hume and Voltaire took care to
do; but clandestinely Spinoza was being read; his Tractatus
theologico-politicus was stirring up Biblical criticism; and M. le Comte
de Boulainvilliers ex- pounded Spinoza under the pretense of refuting
him. Hume himself, in- fluenced by France, was influencing France.
Freemasons were establishing lodges in France, and were privately
enjoying their deistic heresies. Ex- ploration, history, and the
comparative study of religions were adding fire to the crucible in which
Christianity was being tried as never before. Every science, in its
growth, was raising the respect for reason, the belief in uni- versal
law, the disbelief in miracles, including the greatest and most fre-
quent miracle of all — the daily transformation of bread and wine, by
fifty thousand simple priests, into the body and blood of Christ.</p>
<p>Social forces entered into the decay of dogma. Every increase in
wealth was accelerating the race for pleasure, and was making the
restraints of Christian morality more and more irksome in a Paris where
the Most Chris- tian King kept a stud of mistresses, and the Virgin Mary
had been displaced by Mme. de Pompadour. And even the moral laxity of
the age was turned into an indictment of Christianity: how was it that
after seventeen hundred years of Christian domination the morals of
Europe were no better than those of American savages or the “heathen
Chinee”?</p>
<p>Every class but the peasantry included a skeptical minority. The gov-
ernmental bureaucracy resented the independence and the tax immunity of
the Church; the old association between the Church and its “secular
arm,” the state, was breaking down. There w ere freethinkers like
Males-</p>

<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>6 1 1</p>
<p>herbes in the department of censorship, actively protecting Diderot
and the Encyclopedic; and much closer to the King was Mme. de Pompadour,
who hated the Jesuits and was counted by Voltaire as “one of us.” The
aristocracy thought of the Church as supporting a Bourbon dynasty that
had deposed the aristocracy from rule; they were not averse to weakening
the clergy; many nobles enjoyed the irreverencies of Voltaire. The upper
middle class smiled its favor upon the intellectuals who were battling
the clergy; it had never forgiven the Church for condemning interest and
favoring landowners over moneyed men; if these supercilious bishops were
taken down a peg the bourgeoisie would move up in the scale of repute
and power; so financiers like La Popeliniere, Helvetius, and d’Holbach
opened their homes and purses, even, in some cases, their hearts, to the
crusade against the Church. The lawyers had long since been envious of
the clergy; they looked forward to the time when they could rule the
state, as they were already ruling the parlements. In 1747 a police
report alleged that there was hardly an officer of the Paris Parlement
who had not an irre- ligious publication or manuscript in his home. 12
The cafes of Paris hummed with atheism; lampoons of the clergy were the
feast of urban wits, who re- ferred to God as “Monsieur de l’Etre,”
Mr. Being. Even in the provinces anticlerical literature circulated
widely; some traveling salesmen profitably peddled from door to door a
brochure entitled The Three Most Famous Impostors: Moses, Jesus, and
Mahomet* And was not the clergy itself in- fected with religious doubt —
even, here and there, with out-and-out athe- ism? Consider, for
example,</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>JEAN MESLIER: 1678-1733</li>
</ol>
<p>He was the parish priest of Etrepigny in Champagne. Every year he</p>
<p>gave to the poor whatever remained of his salary after paying the
cost of his abstemious life. After thirty years of quiet and exemplary
ministry he died, aged fifty-five, bequeathing all his possessions to
the people of his parish, and leaving three manuscript copies of a
treatise which he entitled “My Testament.” One copy was addressed to his
parishioners; this was surely the strangest bequest in history. On the
enclosing envelope he begged their pardon for having served error and
prejudice through all his career. Apparently he had lost his religious
faith before ordination. “If I embraced a profession so directly opposed
to my sentiments, it was not through cupidity; I obeyed my parents.” 13
Voltaire published parts of the Testament in 1762; d’Holbach and Diderot
issued a summary of it in 1772 as Le Bon Sens du cure Meslier; the full
text was not printed till 1861-64;</p>
<p>• The manuscript is in the Bibliotheque Nadonale.</p>
<p>6l2</p>
<p>THE AGE Of VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>it is now long since out of print, and rarely accessible. In all the
campaign against Christianity, from Bayle to the Revolution, there was
no attack so thoroughgoing, so merciless, as that of this village
priest.</p>
<p>He seems to have begun his doubts by studying the Bible. The result
showed that the Church had been only moderately wise in keeping the
Bible from the common people; she should have kept it from the clergy
too. Father John found many difficulties in Holy Writ. Why was the</p>
<p>genealogy of Christ in the Gospel of St. Matthew so different from
that in Luke, if both were authored by God? Why did both of these
genealogies end with Joseph, who was soon to be excused from begetting
Jesus? Why should the Son of God be complimented on being the Son of
David, who was an arrant adulterer? Did the Old Testament prophecies
apply to Christ, or were those applications mere tours de theological
force? Were the miracles of the New Testament pious frauds, or were they
natural opera- tions misunderstood? Should one believe such stories, or
follow reason? Jean voted for reason:</p>
<p>I will not sacrifice my reason, because this reason alone enables me
to distinguish between good and evil, the true and the false. … I</p>
<p>will not give up experience, because it is a much better guide
than</p>
<p>imagination, or than the authority of the guides whom they wish
to</p>
<p>give me. … I will not distrust my senses. I do not ignore the
fact</p>
<p>that they can sometimes lead me into error; but on the other hand I
know that they do not deceive me always; . . . my senses suffice to</p>
<p>rectify the hasty judgments which they induced me to form . 14</p>
<p>Meslier saw no warrant in reason for believing in free will or the
im- mortality of the soul. He thought that we should be grateful that we
are all allowed an eternal sleep after the turmoil of “this world, which
caus es more trouble than pleasure to the majority of you. . . . Return
peaceably to the universal home from which you come, . . . and pass by
without murmuring, like all the beings that surround you .” 15 To those
who de - fended the conception of heaven as a consolation, he replied
that on their own allegations only a minority ever reached that goal,
while the majority went to hell; how, then, could the idea of
immortality be a consolation? “The belief which delivers me from
overwhelming fears . . . appe ars to me more desirable than the
uncertainty in which I am left through belief in a God who, master of
his favors, gives them but to his favorites, and permits all the others
to render themselves worthy of eternal punishments.” How could any
civilized person believe in a god who would condemn his creatures to
everlasting hell?</p>
<p>Is there in nature a man so cruel as to wish in cold blood to
torment,</p>
<p>I do not say his fellow beings, but any sentient being whatever?</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>Conclude, then, O theologians, that according to your own principles
your God is infinitely more wicked than the most wicked of men.</p>
<p>. . . The priests have made of God such a malicious, ferocious being
. . . that there are few men in the world who do not wish that God did
not exist. . . . What morals would we have if we should imitate this</p>
<p>God ! 16</p>
<p>Voltaire thought this was a bit extreme, and in publishing the
Testament he did his best to soften the priest’s atheism into deism; but
Meslier w as quite uncompromising. The Christian God, he argued, is the
author of all evil, for, since he is omnipotent, nothing can happen
without his consent. If he gives us life, he also causes death; if he
grants us health and riches, he sends us, in recompense, poverty,
famine, disasters, and war . 17 There are in the world many indications
of intelligent design, but are there not quite as many signs that this
Divine Providence, if it exists, is capable of the most devilish
mischief?</p>
<p>All the books are filled with the most flattering praises of
Provi-</p>
<p>dence, whose attentive care is extolled. . . . However, if we examine
all parts of this globe, we see the uncivilized as well as the
civilized</p>
<p>man in a perpetual struggle with Providence; he is compelled to ward
off the blows which it sends in the form of hurricanes, tempests,</p>
<p>frost, hail, inundations, sterility, and the diverse accidents which
so</p>
<p>often render all man’s labors useless. In a word, I see the human
race</p>
<p>this Providence, which is said to be busy with the care of their</p>
<p>happiness . 18</p>
<p>After all, was there ever a stranger and more incredible God than
this? For thousands of years he kept himself hidden from mankind, and
heard without any clear and visible response the prayers and praises of
billions of men. He is supposed to be infinitely wise, but his empire is
ridden with disorder and destruction. He is supposed to be good, but he
punishes like an inhuman fiend. He is supposed to be just, and he lets
the wicked prosper and his saints be tortured to death. He is
continually occupied in creating and destroying . 19</p>
<p>Instead of holding, like Voltaire, that belief in God is natural and
uni- versal, Meslier contended that such a belief is unnatural, arid has
to be infused into the adolescent mind.</p>
<p>All children are atheists — they have no idea of God. . . . Men
be-</p>
<p>lieve in God only upon the word of those who have no more idea of him
than they themselves. Our nurses are our first theologians; they talk to
children about God as they talk to them of werewolves. . . .</p>
<p>614 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Very few people would have a god if care had not been taken to give
them one . 20</p>
<p>And whereas most atheists professed admiration for Jesus, Meslier
included Christ too in his passionate demolition of religious faith.
First of all, what sane man could believe that “God, with the view of
reconciling himself with mankind, . . . would sacrifice his own innocent
and sinless son ?” 21 As for Jesus himself,</p>
<p>We see in him … a fanatic, a misanthrope, who, preaching to the</p>
<p>wretched, advises them to be poor, to combat and extinguish nature,
to hate pleasure, to seek sufferings, and to despise themselves. He
tells them to leave father, mother, all the ties of life, in order to
follow</p>
<p>him. What beautiful morality! … It must be divine, because it is</p>
<p>impracticable for men . 22</p>
<p>Meslier moves on to complete materialism, it is not necessary to go
be- yond matter and ask who created it; the puzzle of origins would be
merely put back a step to the child’s natural question, “Who made God?”
“I say to you that matter acts of itself. . . . Leave to theologians
their ’First</p>
<p>Cause’; nature has no need of this in order to produce all the
effects which you see .” 23 If you must worship something, worship the
sun, as many peoples do, for the sun is the real creator of our life and
health and light and warmth and joy. But alas, mourns Meslier, “if
religion were clear, it would have fewer attractions for the ignorant.
They need obscurity, mys- teries, fables, miracles, incredible things .
24 . . . Priests and legislators, by inventing religions and forging
mysteries, . . . have served them to their taste. In this way they
attract enthusiasts, women, and the illiterate .” 25</p>
<p>All in all, in Meslier’s view, religion has been part of a conspiracy
be - tween Church and state to frighten people into a convenient
obedience to abso lute rule . 26 The priests “took great care to make
their God a terrible, capricious, and changeable tyrant; it was
necessary for them that he should be thus that he might lend himself to
their various interests .” 27 In this con - spiracy the priests are more
to blame than the kings, for they capture con- trol of the prince in his
childhood and then through the confessional; they mold him to
superstition, they warp and stunt his reason, they lead him on to
religious intolerance and brutal persecution . 28 In this way,</p>
<p>theological disputes . . . have unsettled empires, caused
revolutions, ruined sovereigns, devastated the whole of Europe. These
despicable quarrels could not be extinguished even in rivers of blood. .
. . The</p>
<p>votaries of a religion which preaches . . . charity, harmony, and</p>
<p>peace have shown themselves more ferocious than cannibals or savages
every time that their instructors have excited them to the
destruction</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>of their brethren. There is no crime which men have not committed in
the idea of pleasing the deity or appeasing his wrath , 29 … or to sanc-
tion the knaveries of impostors on account of a being who exists only in
their imagination . 30</p>
<p>This gigantic and self-perpetuating conspiracy of Church and
state</p>
<p>against man and reason is defended on the ground that a supernatural
re- ligion, and even a religion of terror, is an indispensable aid in
the task of forming men to morality.</p>
<p>But is it irue that this dogma 〔of heaven and hell〕 renders men . .
.</p>
<p>more virtuous? The nations where this fiction is established, are
they remarkabl ; for the morality of their conduct ? 31 … To disabuse
us</p>
<p>… it is sufficient to open the eyes and to consider what are the</p>
<p>morals of the most religious people. We see haughty tyrants,
courtiers, countless extortioners, unscrupulous magistrates, impostors,
adulterers, libertines, prostitutes, thieves, and rogues of all kinds,
who have never doubted the existence of a vindictive God, or the
punishments of hell, or the joys of Paradise . 32</p>
<p>No; theological ideas, though professed by nearly all men, have very
little effect upon their conduct. God is far away, but temptation is
near. “Whom does the idea of God overawe? A few weak men disappointed
and dis- gusted with this world; some persons whose passions are already
extin- guished by age, infirmities, or reverses of fortune .” 33 It is
not the Church</p>
<p>To discern the true principles of morality men have no need of</p>
<p>theology, of revelation, or of gods; they need but common sense. They
have only to look within themselves, to reflect upon their own nature,
to consult their obvious interests, to consider the object of society
and of each of its members; and they will easily understand that virtue
is an advantage, and that vice is an injury, to beings of their
species.</p>
<p>. . . Men are unhappy only because they are ignorant; they are</p>
<p>ignorant only because everything conspires to prevent them from</p>
<p>being enlightened; and they are wicked only because their reason is
not sufficiently developed . 35</p>
<p>Philosophers could build a natural and effective morality if they
were not frightened into a hypocritical orthodoxy by fear of powerful
priests.</p>
<p>From the most remote periods theology alone regulated the march</p>
<p>of philosophy. What aid has theology given it? It changed it into
an</p>
<p>6 1 6 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>unintelligible jargon, . . . with words void of sense, better suited
to</p>
<p>obscure than to enlighten. . . . How Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz,
and many others have been compelled to invent hypotheses and eva- sions
in order to reconcile their discoveries with the reveries and the
blunders which religion had rendered sacred! With what precautions have
not the greatest philosophers guarded themselves, even at the risk of
being absurd . . . and unintelligible, whenever their ideas did</p>
<p>not correspond with the principles of theology! Vigilant priests were
always ready to extinguish systems which could not be made to tally with
their interests. … All that the most enlightened men could do</p>
<p>was to speak and write with hidden meaning; and often, by a cowardly
complaisance, to shamefully ally falsehood with truth. . . . How</p>
<p>could modern philosophers, who, threatened with the most cruel</p>
<p>persecution, were called upon to renounce reason and to submit to
faith — that is, to priestly authority — how could men thus fettered
give free flight to their genius, . . . or hasten human progress ?
30</p>
<p>Some philosophers have had the courage to accept experience and
reason as their guides, and to shake off the chains of superstition —
Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Strabo. “But their systems, too simple,
too sensible, and too stripped of wonders for the lovers of fancy, were
obliged to yield to the fabulous conjectures of Plato, Socrates, and
Zeno. Among the mod- erns, Hobbes, Spinoza, Bayle, and others have
followed the path of Epi- curus .” 37</p>
<p>Meslier mourned the loss to mankind from this domination of
philosophy by theology. He pleaded for freedom of thought as the basic
right that “alone can give to men humaneness and grandeur of soul .”
38</p>
<p>It is only by showing them the truth that they can know their
best</p>
<p>interests and the real motives that will lead them to happiness. Long
enough have the instructors of the people fixed their eyes upon</p>
<p>heaven; let them at last bring them back to earth. Tired of an incom-
prehensible theology, of ridiculous fables, of impenetrable mysteries,
of puerile ceremonies, let the human mind occupy itself with natural
things, intelligible objects, sensible truths, and useful knowledge .
39</p>
<p>Let thought and speech and print be free, let education be secular
and unconstrained, and men will move day by day toward utopia. The
exist- ing social order is iniquitous; it makes a small minority idly
rich and cor- rupt with luxury, at the cost of keeping millions of men
in a degrading poverty and ignorance. The root of the evil is the
institution of property. Property is theft, and education, religion, and
law are adjusted to protect and sanctify this theft . 40 A revolution to
overthrow this conspiracy of the few against the many would be quite
justified. “Where,” Meslier cried</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>617</p>
<p>out in his final fury, “where are the Jacques Clement 〔who killed
Henry III〕 and the Ravaillac 〔assassin of Henry IV〕 of our France?
Are there</p>
<p>men still alive in our days to stun and stab all these detestable
monsters, enemies of the human race, and by these means deliver the
people from tyranny?” 41 Let the nation appropriate all property; let
every man be put to moderate work; let the product be equally shared.
Let men and women mate as they wish and part when they please; let their
children be brought up together in communal schools. There would then be
an end to domestic strife, to class war, and poverty; then Christianity
would at last be real! 42</p>
<p>Having said all this, Jean Meslier concluded his Testament with a
defi- ance to all who, as he knew, would execrate him.</p>
<p>Let them think and judge and say and do what they will; . . .</p>
<p>1 shall pay little heed. . . . Even now I have almost ceased to
heed</p>
<p>what happens in the world. The dead, w hose company I am now about to
join, have no more troubles, and disquiet themselves no more. So I am
putting finis to all this. Even now I am little more than nothing. Soon
I shall be nothing indeed. 43</p>
<p>Was there ever a testament like this in the history of mankind?
Picture the lonely priest, shorn of all faith and hope, living out his
silenced life in a village where probably every soul but his own would
have been horrified to learn his secret thoughts. So he talked freely
only to his manuscript; and there, recklessly and without any wide
knowledge of the nature of man, he poured out his resentment in the most
complete antireligious decla- ration that even this age would ever know.
All the campaign of Voltaire against Finfame was here, all the
materialism of La Mettrie, the atheism of d’Holbach, the devastating
phantasies of Diderot, even the communism of Babeuf. Hesitantly issued
by Voltaire, joyfully published by d’Hol bach, the Testament of Jean
Meslier entered into the ferment of the French mind, and shared in
preparing the collapse of the Old Regime and the ecstasies of the
Revolution.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>IS MAN A MACHINE?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, said Julien Offroy de La Mettrie. Born in St.-Malo (1709) to
a</p>
<p>prosperous merchant, he received abundant education, and decided to
be a poet. His father recommended the ecclesiastical profession as less
perilous; he sent Julien to a college at Plessis, where the boy became
an ardent Jan- senist. But a doctor friend of the father thought (as
Frederick the Great put it) that “a mediocre physician would be better
paid for his remedies than a good priest for his absolutions.” 44 So
Julien turned his zeal to anat -</p>
<p>6 18</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>omy and medicine, received the doctor’s degree at Reims, studied
under Boerhaave at Leiden, wrote several medical treatises, served as
surgeon in the French army, and saw “one per cent glory and ninety -nine
per cent diarrhea” 46 on the f ields of Dettingen and Fontenoy. Himself
bedded with violent fever, he claimed, on recovery, that the clearness
of his thinking had varied with the height of his fever; from this he
concluded that thought is a function of the brain. He published these
and allied ideas in 1745 in Histoire naturelle de Fame.</p>
<p>We cannot know what the soul is (ran the argument), and we do not
know what matter is; we do know, however, that we never find a soul
without a body. To study the soul we must study the body, and to study
the body we must investigate the laws of matter. Matter is not mere
exten- sion, it is also a capacity for motion; it contains an active
principle, which takes more and more complex forms in different bodies.
We do not know that matter has of itself the power to feel, but we see
evidences of that power in even the lowest animals. It is more logical
to believe that this sensitivity is a development from some kindred
potentiality in matter than to ascribe it to some mysterious soul
infused into bodies by a supernatural agency. So the “active principle”
in matter evolves through plants and animals until in man it enables the
heart to beat, the stomach to digest, and the brain to think. This is
the natural history of the soul.</p>
<p>The chaplain in La Mettrie’s regiment trembled at this conclusion. He
sounded an alarm, and the medicophilosopher was dismissed from his post
as surgeon. His fellow physicians might have come to his aid, but he had
written about the same time a little book, The Politics of Physicians ,
sati- rizing their intrigues in competition for lucrative posts. They
joined in de- nouncing him; he found both his practice and his
reputation ruined. He fled to Leiden, wrote another attack upon the
medical profession, and turned to philosophy.</p>
<p>So at Leiden in 1748 he issued V Homme machine. By the term machine
La Mettrie means a body whose actions are due entirely to physical or
chemical causes and processes. That the animal body is a machine in this
sense is clear to him from a hundred phenomena: the flesh of animals
con- tinues to palpitate, and their intestines continue peristalsis, for
some time after death; muscles separated from the body contract when
stimulated, and so forth. Animals, then, are machines; and if so, why
not men, whose bones, muscles, tendons, and nerves are so remarkably
similar to those of the higher animals? The mind obviously depends upon
the physicochemical operations of the body. Opium, coffee, wine, and
diverse drugs do not merely affect the body, they can alter the stream
and character of thought, the mood and force of the will. Change a few
fibers in Fontenelle’s brain, and you make him an idiot. 46 Bodily
disease can weaken the mind; “the soul</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>gains vigor with the body, and acquires keenness as the body
gains</p>
<p>strength.” 47 Diet influences character; so “the English, who eat
meat red</p>
<p>proper organization of the brain and of the whole body, . . . they
are apparently but this organization itself; the soul is clearly an
enlightened machine . . . Soul is therefore but an empty word, of which
no one</p>
<p>has any idea, and which an enlightened man should use only to signify
the part in us that thinks. 50</p>
<p>In L’ Homme plante (1748) La Mettrie developed the “great chain of
being” into a theory of e volution. He lost some of his confidence when
he tried to bridge the apparent gap between the inorganic and the
organic; suddenly he forgot mechanism, and slipped into vitalism: he
supposed cer- tain semences, seeds, which enabled matter to beget life.
51 After that he found it easy to follow Lucretius: “The first
generations must have been quite imperfect; . . . perfection could not
have been the work of a day in nature, any more than in art.” 52 To
diminish the gap between animals and men, La Mettrie argues, against
Descartes, that some animals reason:</p>
<p>Let us observe the ape, the beaver, the elephant, etc., in their
opera- tion. If it is clear that these activities cannot be performed
without</p>
<p>intelligence, why refuse intelligence to these animals? And if
you</p>
<p>grant them a soul, you are lost. . . . Who does not see that the soul
of an animal must be either mortal or immortal, whichever ours is?
53</p>
<p>There is no great difference between the simplest man and the most
in- telligent animal. “Imbeciles … are animals with human faces, as the
in - telligent ape is a little man in another shape.” 54 La Mettrie
adds, with his peculiar humor, that “the entire realm of man” is “but a
composite of dif- ferent monkeys, at whose head Pope has placed Newton.”
55 Man ceased to be a monkey only when he invented specific sounds as
convenient ex- pressions for specific ideas; he became man through
language. 56</p>
<p>Did La Mettrie admit a God as Prime Mover of the world machine?</p>
<p>Voltaire and Diderot had defended the argument from design; La
Mettrie rejected it scornfully:</p>
<p>All reasoning based on final causes is frivolous. . . . Nature
makes</p>
<p>silk the way the Bourgeois Gentilhomme speaks prose — without
know-</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>ing it. It is as blind when it gives life as it is innocent when it
destroys it. . . . Having, without seeing, made eyes that see, it has
made,</p>
<p>without thinking, a machine that thinks. 57</p>
<p>La Mettrie was not explicitly an atheist; he affected rather to
discard the question of God as unimportant; “it does not matter, for our
peace of mind, whether matter is eternal or has been created, whether
there is or is not a God.” 58 But he quoted a probably fictitious
“friend” as holding that “the universe will never be happy unless it is
atheistic”; for then there will be no more theological disputes, no
ecclesiastical persecutions, no more religious wars, and man will
express his natural instincts with no sense of sin. 59 As for himself,
La Mettrie was content with materialism. He ended his VHomme machine on
a defiant note: “Such is my system— or rather the truth, unless I am
much deceived. It is short and simple. Dispute it now who will.” 60
Perhaps as a parting jest he dedicated his agnostic manifesto to the
pious poet and physiologist Albrecht von Haller, who rejected the
dedication with horror in a letter to the Journal des savants for May,
1749:</p>
<p>The anonymous author of VHomme machine having dedicated to</p>
<p>me a work as dangerous as it is unusual, I feel that I owe it to God,
to religion, and to myself to make the following statement: … I</p>
<p>declare that the book in question is completely alien to my
sentiments.</p>
<p>I regard its dedication to myself as an outrage, exceeding in
cruelty</p>
<p>all those which its anonymous author has inflicted on so many worthy
people; and I beg the . . . public to be assured that I have never
had</p>
<p>anything to do with the author, . . . that I do not know him, . .
.</p>
<p>and that I should look upon any consonance of views between us as one
of the most unmitigated calamities that could possibly befall me. 61</p>
<p>La Mettrie continued to print the dedication in later editions of his
book.</p>
<p>VHomme machine was widely reviewed and unanimously refuted. It was a
simple matter to criticize the disorderly composition of the little
volume, to condemn its self-assurance, and to expose careless errors of
fact. It was not at all obvious that “the soul and the body fall asleep
together”; 62 some authors are more brilliant in their dreams than on
the page. A sick body may house a good mind, as with Pope and Scarron;
and our rare- meat lovers will not admit that they are still in the
hunting stage. La Mettrie himself, who was up to every prank, published
a pretended critique of his book in an anonymous VHomme plus qu’une
machine ( Man More Than a Machine) — probably as a means of drawing
attention to his major work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he may have been really impressed by antimechanis-
tic arguments. We know that he was interested in Trembley’s demonstra -
tion (1744) of the fresh- water polyp’s regenerative powers, which
did</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>THE ATHEISTS</p>
<p>621</p>
<p>not easily accord with mechanistic theory. Georg Stahl, of phlogiston
fame, had boldly inverted the physiological thesis by declaring (1707)
that instead of the body determining the ideas and volitions of the
soul, it was the soul — the inherent animating principle — that
determined the growth and action of the organs. Theophile de Bordeu —
physician to d’Alembert - held that physiological processes, even of the
simplest digestion, are in- capable of mechanistic or purely chemical
explanations. 63 And Jean Baptiste Robinet offered a cosmic vitalism
that endowed all matter with life and sensitivity. La Mettrie was
apparently willing to accept this solution of the problem of matter
versus life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he proceeded to deduce a hedonistic ethic from his
material- istic philosophy. In three separate works — Discours sur le
bonheur, La Volupte (Pleasure), and VArt de jouir ( The Art of
Enjoyment) — he pro- claimed self-love to be the highest virtue, and
sense pleasure the supreme good. He resented the theological denigration
of the pleasures of life, and questioned the alleged superiority of
intellectual pleasure; all pleasures, he thought, are really sensual;
hence simple people, who do not bother with intellect, are happier than
philosophers. Let no man (said La Mettrie) re- pent his indulgence in
sensual delights if these involved no harm to others. Nor should the
criminal be held morally responsible for his crimes; he is the product
of heredity and environment, over which he had no control. He should be
treated not with sermons but with medicine; with a firm- ness that
protects society, but also with a humaneness that recognizes uni- versal
determinism. “It would be desirable to have for judges none but the most
skillfu l physicians.” 64</p>
<p>These pronouncements marked the victory of Epicurus (misunderstood)
over Zeno in eighteenth-century France: the Stoic philosophy of the
classic age of Louis XIV surrendered, in the Enlightenment, to the
Epicurean vindication of pleasure, the universalization of matter, and
the banishment of the gods. No wonder La Mettrie’s books were widely
sold to a public disillusioned of theology and tired of classic
formalism and moral restraint. Polite society, however, shied away from
him as an intellectual maverick who had incontinently revealed too many
upper-class tenets. The clergy attacked him as an emissary of Satan; the
theologians of Leiden prodded the Dutch government into ordering him out
of the country. The free- thinking Frederick the Great invited him to
Prussia (February, 1748), gave him a pension, and enrolled him in the
Berlin Academy of Sciences. La Mettrie resumed the practice of medicine,
and wrote, on asthma and dysentery, treatises that the King considered
the best of their kind. Vol- taire, after rubbing elbows with La Mettrie
at Frederick’s court, wrote to Mme. Denis (November 6, 1750):</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>There is here too gay a man; it is La Mettrie. His ideas are
fireworks</p>
<p>always in the form of skyrockets. His chatter is amusing for half
a</p>
<p>quarter of an hour, and mortally tiresome thereafter. He has just</p>
<p>made, without knowing it, a bad book, … in which he proscribes</p>
<p>virtue and remorse, eulogizes the vices, and invites his readers to
dis- orderly living — all without bad intention. There are in his work
a</p>
<p>thousand brilliant touches, and not half a page of reason; they
are</p>
<p>like flashes of lightning in the night. . . . God keep me from
taking</p>
<p>him for my doctor! He would give me corrosive sublimate instead of
rhubarb, very innocently, and then begin to laugh. This strange doctor
is the King’s reader, and the best of it is that he is at present
reading to him the History of the Church. He goes over hundreds of pages
of it, and there are places where monarch and reader are ready to choke
with laughter. 65</p>
<p>La Mettrie had described death as the conclusion of a farce (“la
