<h4 id="chapter-xiii">CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<p>Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa</p>
<p>I. IMPERIAL PRELUDE: 1711-40</p>
<p>V OLTAIRE was apparently the first to dub Frederick “Great” (“ Fred -
eric le Grand”), so early as 1742; 1 the phrase was part of a mutual -
admiration pact with still ten years to run. But if history may join
Whitman in blowing bugles for the defeated it might as justly call Maria
Theresa great, for she was one of several queens who in modern times
have sur- passed and shamed most kings.</p>
<p>Let us approach her through her background. Six years before her
birth her Hapsburg father succeeded ( 1 7 1 1 ) as Charles VI to the
throne of the “Holy Roman Empire.” Voltaire thought it none of the
three, but it was still an empire, dressed in the dignity of nine
centuries. Governed loosely from Vienna, it included Austria, Hungary,
Bohemia (Czechoslovakia), Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and the Tirol;
and in 1715 it extended its power over the former Spanish Netherlands,
which we know as Belgium. The German states were only formally subject
to the emperor, but the German free cities acknowledged his authority in
their external affairs. Bohemia was now in decline, disordered by
religious intolerance and exploited by ab- sentee landlords mostly of
alien speech. Hungary had suffered from being the chief area of
contention between Christians and Turks; a dozen armies had crossed and
consumed it; population had fallen, local government was in chaos; a
numerous and martial nobility, now only partly Magyar, re- fused to pay
Imperial taxes, and hated Austrian rule. None but nobles and the Church
owned land in Hungary; they divided it into enormous estates tilled by
serfs, and drew from them the revenues with which they built great
monasteries, castles, and palaces, and patronized music and art. Some
nobles owned fifty thousand acres each; the Esterhazy family held seven
million. 2</p>
<p>Austria itself, as chief beneficiary of the Empire, was prospering.
Whereas Hungary had some two millions population, Austria had
approximately 6,100,000 in 1754, expanding to 8,500,000 in 1800. Here,
too, the land was owned by nobles or clergy and tilled by serfs; serfdom
survived there till</p>
<ol start="1848" type="1">
<li>As in England, the estates were kept intact by primogeniture, the
bequest of the whole to the oldest son; younger sons were cared for
by</li>

<p>432 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>appointment to posts in the army, the Church, or the administration;
so the court of the Emperor Charles VI numbered forty thousand souls.
There was no rich middle class in Austria to challenge the omnipotence
of the aristocracy, or dilute its blue blood. Marriages were matters of
protocol. Mistresses and lovers were allowed by unwritten law, but only
within the class. Lady Mary Montagu wrote from Vienna in 1716,
presumably with the exaggerations of a traveler:</p>
<p>’Tis the established custom for every lady to have two husbands, one
that bears the name, and another that performs the duties. And these
engagements are so well known that it would be a downright affront, and
publicly resented, if you invited a woman of quality to dinner</p>
<p>without at the same time inviting her two attendants, . . . lover
and</p>
<p>husband, between whom she always sits in state with great gravity. .
.</p>
<p>A woman looks out for a lover as soon as she is married, as part of
her equipage. 3</p>
<p>The aristocracy, throughout what was now being transformed into an
Austro-Hungarian empire, worked hand in hand with the Church. The nobles
probably took the Catholic theology with a grain of salt; several of
them were Freemasons; 4 but they contributed gratefully to a religion
that so graciously helped their serfs and undowered daughters to
reconcile themselves hopefully to their earthly lot. Diversity of creeds
would have confused this operation by leading to debate and doubt;
religious toleration was obviously bad politics. Archbishop Firmian of
Salzburg made life so uncomfortable for the Protestants in his
archdiocese that thirty thousand of them migrated, mostly to Prussia
(1722-2 3),® where they strengthened Austria’s rising enemy. Similar
migrations or expulsions from Bohemia shared in the economic decline of
that once proudly independent state, and contributed to the advance of
Protestant Germany.</p>
<p>Rich and poor joined in financing the ecclesiastical architecture of
the age. In Prague the greatest of Czech architects, Kilian Ignaz
Dientzen- hofer, completed in massive grandeur the Church of
St. Nicholas, which Christoph Dientzenhofer had begun. Johann Bernhard
Fischer von Erlach, the greatest of Austrian architects, left his mark
in Salzburg, Prague, and Rome, and, with his son Josef Emanuel, raised a
baroque masterpiece in the Church of St. Charles at Vienna. Magnificent
monasteries proclaimed the glory of God and the comforts of celibacy.
There was the Benedictine abbey at Melk on the Danube, where Jakob
Prandtauer and his aides spread 6 a complex of buildings, towers, and
dome, with an interior of stately arches, perfect pillars, and gorgeous
decoration. There was the old convent of the Augustinian canons at
Diirnstein, rebuilt 7 in sumptuous baroque by Josef Munggenast; note
that its chief glories, the main portal and the west tower,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>were the product of Matthias Steindl, a sculptor who took up
architecture at the age of seventy-eight. There were the Benedictine
abbey church and library at Altenburg (also by Munggenast 8 ), famous
for luxuriant orna- ment. There was the twelfth-century abbey of the
Cistercian friars at Zwettl, where Munggenast and Steindl raised a new
fagade, tower, and library; 9 the glorious choir, however, was the
achievement of Meister Jo- hann in 1343-48; here the old Gothic
displayed its superiority over the new baroque. There was Stams Abbey in
the Tirol, rebuilt 10 by Georg Gumpp, and distinguished by the iron
grilles and stucco decoration of its “Prelates’ Staircase”; here the
Hapsburg princes were buried. There was the abbey church at
Herzogenburg, the chef- d’oeuvre in the brief life (1724 -48) of Josef
Munggenast’s son Franz. And there was the abbey church at Wil - hering,
which has been judged “the loveliest rococo building in Austria.” 11 We
remark, in passing, the superb organs in these churches, as at Herzogen-
burg and Wilhering, and the handsome libraries; typical is the
Bibliothek- saal of the Benedictine monastery at Admont, housing 94,000
volumes and 1,100 manuscripts in a shrine of baroque embellishment. The
monks of Austria were at the height of their glory in this age of waning
faith.</p>
<p>The nobles kept pace with them. In Austria and Hungary, as in
Ger-</p>
<p>many, every prince hungered for a Versailles; and though he could not
rival that unconscionable splendor he gathered sufficient spoils to
build a palais (as he called it) whose every aspect should mirror his
transcendence. Prince Eugene of Savoy raised a summer palace on two
levels of his estate outside Vienna: a “Lower Belvedere” (now the
Barockmuseum) , and an “Upper Belvedere” handsomely designed by Johann
Lukas von Hilde - brandt. Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach designed
the Prince’s Winter Palace (now the Finance Ministry). He also drew up
plans for the palace and gardens of Schonbrunn to rival Versailles, but
the actual construction, begun in 1696, abandoned or reduced these plans
as it proceeded. Fischer von Erlach and his son Josef Emanuel designed
the Imperial — now the National- Library, which a specialist in baroque
art considers to have the finest interior of any library in the world.
12 In 1726 Charles VI opened this treasure to the public; in 1737 he
bought for it Eugene of Savo y’s immense collection of manuscripts and
books. Vienna was by far the most beautiful city in the Germanic
realm.</p>
<p>Most Austrian architecture was adorned with sculpture. We note with
shamefaced ignorance the wood Crucifixion by Andra Thamasch in Stams
Abbey, and Balthasar Moll’s marble figure of the Emperor Francis I in
the</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>sculptors of this age? Born in Esslingen in Lower Austria (1693),
he</p>
<p>learned his art from Giovanni Giuliani; through this Italian tutelage
he acquired the classic bent that enabled him to chasten the exuberance
of Austrian baroque. His marble Apotheosis of Charles VI, 13 however,
still suffers from the fancifulness of baroque — the Emperor is raised
to heaven by an angel with charming legs and effulgent breasts;
nevertheless we are grateful to art for restoring to the seraphim — whom
philosophy had thought bodiless — something tangible. Almost worthy of
Renaissance Italy is Don- ner’s St. Martin and the Beggar in the
cathedral at Pressburg (Bratislava) ; and his marble relief Hagar in the
Wilderness 14 has a smooth classic grace. He reached his peak in the
figures that he cast in lead for two great</p>
<p>fountains in Vienna: the Providence Fountain in the Neuer Markt,
repre- senting the rivers of Austria, and the Andromeda Fountain,
rivaling the fonti of Rome. Just a year before his death in 1741 he cast
for the cathedral of Gurk a group representing the lamentation of Mary
over the corpse of Christ; this would have made Raphael rejoice that
Donner had taken his name.</p>
<p>Neither the painters nor the poets produced in this age in Austria or
its dependencies any works that attracted the attention of the outside
world, except, perhaps, the frescoes that Daniel Gran painted within the
cupola of the great library in Vienna. But in music Vienna was the
acknowledged center of the Western world. Charles VI loved music only
next to his daughters and his throne. He himself composed an opera,
accompanied Farinelli on the harpsichord, and conducted rehearsals. He
brought to Vienna the best vocalists, instrumentalists, actors, and
scene painters, re- gardless of cost; on one occasion he spent, in Lady
Mary’s e stimate, thirty thousand pounds to stage one opera. 15 His
chapel choir numbered 1 35 sing- ers and players. Music became imperial,
or at least noble: in some operas all the participants — soloists,
chorus, ballet, orchestra — were members of the aristocracy. In one such
performance the principal role was sung by the Archduchess Maria
Theresa. 16</p>
<p>The greatest librettists of the time accepted the call to Vienna.
Apostolo Zeno came from Venice in 1718, served as court poet to Charles
VI, and in 1730 retired amiably in favor of Pietro Trapassi, the
Neapolitan who had been renamed Metastasio. During the next ten years
Metastasio wrote — al- ways in Italian — such stirring poetic dramas
that the leading composers of Western Europe were happy to set them to
music. No one rivaled him in adapting poetry to the demands of opera —
i.e., in adjusting the theme, ac- tion, and feeling of his text to
provide the requisite solos, duets, recitatives, choruses, ballets, and
spectacles; but in return he exacted from the com- posers the harmonious
accordance of the music with the play. His success was so great that
Voltaire worried that opera might drive drama from the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>sta ge; “ce beau monstre” he said, “etouffe Melpomene 〔the Muse of
tragedy〕” 17</p>
<p>Over all this music, art, and multilingual court and empire Charles
VI presided with lavish hand, kind heart, and martial grief. His
generals could not follow his baton; they gave him tragedies when he
called for odes to joy. While Eugene of Savoy, who had shared with
Marlborough in beat- ing back the armies of Louis XIV, still retained
his vigor of mind and com- mand, matters military went well for Austria:
she took Belgrade from the Turks, Sardinia from Savoy, and Milan,
Naples, and the Spanish Nether- lands from Spain. Eugene was promoted to
be not only generalissimo of all Austrian armies, but also first
minister and director of diplomacy; in effect he ruled everything but
opera. But then, in the normal disintegration of our flesh, he grew weak
not only in body but in mind. In the War of the Polish Succession
(1733-35) Austria slipped into conflict with France, Spain, and Savoy
(now known as the “small kingdom of Sardinia”) ; she lost Lorraine,
Naples, and Sicily ( 1 735-38) . An alliance with Russia brought on
another war with Turkey; Bosnia, Serbia, and Wallachia were lost;
Belgrade became Turkish again (1739). The Emperor could not supply the
talents missing in his aides. As Frederick the Great saw him,</p>
<p>Charles VI had received from nature the qualities that make a
good</p>
<p>citizen, but none of those that make a great man. He was generous,
but without discernment; of a spirit limited and without penetration; he
had application, but without genius. He worked hard but accomplished
little. He knew German law well, and several languages; he excelled
above all in Latin. He was a good father, a good husband, but bigoted
and superstitious like all the princes of the House of Austria . 18</p>
<p>His consolation and pride were in his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa,
and his heart was set on having her inherit his throne. However, his
father, Leopold I, had laid down (1703) a “Pactum Mutuae Successionis,”
by which the principle of male primogeniture was to govern the
succession; in default of a male heir, the crown should pass to the
daughters of his son Joseph (b. 1678), and, next in line, to the
daughters of his son Charles (b. 1685). The death of Joseph I in 17 1 1
without male heir (but with two surviving daughters) left the crown to
Charles. In 1713, in a “Pragmatic</p>
<p>43^ THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>was officially accepted by Spain, Russia, Prussia, England, Holland,
Den- mark, Scandinavia, and France.</p>
<p>But there were difficulties, which made much history. Saxony and</p>
<p>Bavaria had princes who had married the daughters of Charles’s
brother Joseph, and who now claimed the succession to the Imperial
throne by virtue of the Pactum of Leopold I. Frederick William I of
Prussia con- sented on the understanding that Charles would support his
claim to a part of the duchies of Jiilich and Berg. Charles apparently
agreed to this con- dition, but soon gave contrary promises to Frederick
William’s competitors. The Prussian King thereupon allied himself with
the Emperor’s enemies. 19</p>
<p>In 1736 Maria Theresa, in her eighteenth year, married Francis
Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, later (1737) Grand Duke of Tuscany. On
October</p>
<p>20, 1740, Charles VI died, ending the male line of the Hapsburgs, and
Maria Theresa mounted the throne as archduchess of Austria and queen of
Bohemia and Hungary. Her husband became coruler, but, as he showed
little concern or capacity for affairs of state, the full burden of
government fell upon the young Queen. She had in 1 740 all the charms of
womanhood as well as of royalty: fine features, brilliant blue eyes,
rich blond hair, grace of manners and movement, the zest of health, the
animation of youth. 20 Her intelligence and her character were superior
to these charms, yet they seemed inadequate to the problems that
encompassed her. She was now four months pregnant with the child wh o
was to succeed her as the “enlightened despot” Joseph II. Her right to
the throne was challenged by both Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria,
and Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, and a strong faction in
Vienna favored the Bavarian cause. There was no assurance that Hungary
would acknowledge her as its queen; she was not so crowned till June 24,
1741. The Imperial treasury contained only</p>
<p>100,000 florins, which the Empress Dowager, widow of Charles VI,</p>
<p>claimed as her own. The army was in disorder, and its generals were
in- competent. The Council of State was manned by old men who had lost
the ability to organize or command. Rumors circulated that the Turks
would soon again march upon Vienna. 21 Philip V of Spain demanded Hun-
gary and Bohemia, the King of Sardinia demanded Lombardy, as the price
of recognition. 22 Frederick II, who had become king of Prussia only
five months before Maria Theresa’s accession, sent an offer to recognize
and defend her, and promote her husband’s election as emperor, if she
would cede to him the greater part of Silesia. She rejected the offer,
remembering her father’s hope that the realm would remain undivided and
unimpaired. On December 23, 1740, Frederick invaded Silesia, and the
twenty-three- year-old Queen found herself at war with the strongest
power in Germany, and with the man who was to be the greatest general of
his time.</p>

<li>PRUSSIAN PRELUDE: 1713-4O</li>

<li>Frederick William I</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hohenzollern family had succeeded in graduating the electorate of
Brandenburg into the kingdom of Prussia in 1701; the Elector had become
King Frederick I, and, dying, had bequeathed his realm to his son
Frederick William I (r. 1713-40). Through his wife, Sophia Dorothea, the
new</p>
<p>monarch was son-in-law to George I, who in 1714 mounted the throne of
England. The Prussian dominions included East Prussia, Lower Pomerania,
the Mark of Brandenburg (centering around Berlin), the district of
Cleves in western Germany, and the county of Mark and city of Ravensberg
in Westphalia: a loose assortment of lands running interruptedly from
the Vistula to the Elbe, and united only by the forces of the King. In
1740 this “Prussia” had some 3,300,000 population* which grew to
5,800,000 by the end of the century. The social structure was mainly
feudal: a peasantry paying taxes and feudal dues, a weak middle class, a
nobility demanding exemption from taxes as the price of providing
military support to the king. It was in part to free himself from
dependence upon these nobles that Fred- erick William I organized a
standing army that was to determine for half a century the political
history of Central Europe.</p>
<p>Frederick William was quite as unusual a ruler as his more famous
son, whose victories were in great part due to his father’s army.
Neither father</p>
<p>He required everyone to work as hard as himself. He ordered municipal
officials to censor the morals of the population, to preach industry and
thrift, and to discipline tramps with hard labor. Commerce and
manufac-</p>
<p>43** THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>tures were kept under state control, but they were encouraged by the
im- provement of canals and roads. In 1722 the watchful King decreed
uni- versal compulsory education; every parish must maintain a school;
by 1750 Prussia led all Europe in both primary and secondary education.
23 and the seed was sown for the age of Kant and Goethe.</p>
<p>Finding that pious persons worked more steadily than skeptics,
Frederick William supported the Pietist movement. Catholics were
grudgingly toler- ated. Calvinists were told to stop preaching their
predestinarian gloom. Lutherans were ordered to use German instead of
Latin in their liturgy, and to abandon surplices, stoles, and the
elevation of the Sacrament, as papistical vestiges. When the Archbishop
of Salzburg forced fifteen thou- sand Protestants to emigrate, Frederick
William welcomed them, advanced them money for their five-hundred-mile
journey, leased them lands (not of the best), provided them with tools
and seed on loan, and exempted them from taxation till their soil grew
profits. Another fifteen thousand immigrants were brought in from
Switzerland and German states. Prussia, ruined by the Thirty Years’ War,
was restored to economic life.</p>
<p>Behind this royal activity the dominant passion was to make the
nation secure in a warring world. When Frederick William came to power
the Great Northern War was still on, involving Sweden, Russia, Poland,
Den- mark, Saxony, soon England; the obvious lesson was that in a world
of nationalized robbery a strong army was indispensable even for peace.
Anx- ious to get Stettin as a port for the commerce of Berlin, the
Prussian King bought it for 400,000 thalers from the powers that had
seized it from Charles XII. Charles, returning from Turkey, refused to
recognize this sale of stolen goods; Frederick William offered to return
it to Sweden for a return of his 400,000 thalers; Charles had no money,
but insisted on re- gaining Stettin; Prussia declared war on him (1715)
and joined his enemies in besieging Stralsund. Charles, half the world
against him, fled to Sweden and death; Frederick William returned to
Berlin with Stettin in his pocket and triumph in his eyes.</p>
<p>Thereafter his first administrative concern was his army. He was not
quite a militarist, certainly not a warrior; he never again waged war,
but he was resolved that no one should with impunity make war upon him;
this builder of the most famous army of that century was “one of the
most pacific of princes.” 24 “My maxim,” he said, “is to injure no one,
but not to let myself be slighted.” 25 So he gathered soldiers, and
sought with passion the tallest he could find; to win his good will one
had only to send him a man at least six feet tall. The King paid well
for them, and his heart warmed at their height. He was no madder than
his fellow kings, except about inches. France in 1 7 1 3 had 1 60,000
regular troops, Russia 1 30,000, Austria 9o,ooo. 28 To bring the
Prussian army up to 80,000 men in a country with a</p>

<p>population of only three millions, Frederick William enlisted men
from abroad and conscripted men at home. The peasants and the townsmen
re- sisted impressment; they were taken by ruse or force; in one case a
recruit- ing officer invaded a church and carried off the tallest and
strongest men, notwithstanding their prayers. 27 (Let us remember that
we too conscript.) Once the men were enrolled they were cared for well,
but were subjected to ruthless discipline and arduous drill; flogging
was the penalty for even minor offenses.</p>
<p>Conscription was applied to the aristocracy too; every able-bodied
noble had to serve as an officer as long as he could physically bear the
strain. These officers underwent a special training, and were especially
honored by the King. They became a ruling caste, which looked down upon
merchants,, teachers, clergymen, and the middle classes generally as
weakling inferiors, and often treated them with swashbuckling insolence
or brutality. Mean- while they drilled the infantry, artillery, and
cavalry in such precise forma- tions and flexible movements as probably
no other modern army has ever known. The King himself took part in these
military maneuvers, and su- pervised in loving detail the training of
his troops. When Frederick II came to the throne he found under his
command a force of men ready for strata- gems and spoils, and overriding
in a moment all the lessons of peace that the Prince had learned from
philosophy.</p>
<p>2 . Der junge Fritz</p>
<p>The “great Drill - Sergeant of the Prussian Nation” (as Carlyle
called</p>
<p>Frederick William I 28 ) had ten children, of whom the eldest was
Wilhel- mine. The memoirs which she left at her death (1758) are our
most im- mediate and intimate source for the early history of her
brother. Perhaps she detailed with selective emphasis the cruelty of her
governess, the hard selfishness of her mother, the brutality of her
father, his despotic orders for her marriage, his harsh treatment of the
Fritz whom she loved as the pride and solace of her life. 29 “There
never was such love as ours for one an - other. … I loved my brother so
passionately that I always tried to give him pleasure.” 30</p>
<p>Frederick, born January 24, 1712, was three years her junior. Neither
his mother nor his father was pleased with him. They strove to make him
a general and a king; he gave every sign of becoming a poet and a
musician. We have Frederick William’s instructions to the instructors of
his s on:</p>
<p>Impress my son with a proper love and fear of God, as the founda-</p>
<p>tion and sole pillar of our temporal and eternal welfare. No false
reli- gions, or sects of atheist, Arian, Socinian, or whatever name the
poison-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>ous things have which can so easily corrupt a young mind, are to be
ever named in his hearing 〔Frederick became all of these〕 . On the
other hand, a proper abhorrence of papistry, and insight into its
baselessness and absurdity, are to be communicated to him. . . .</p>
<p>Let the Prince learn French and German, … no Latin. . . . Let</p>
<p>him learn arithmetic, mathematics, artillery, economy, to the very
bot- tom. . . . History in particular. . . . With increasing years you
will</p>
<p>more and more … go upon fortification, the formation of a camp,</p>
<p>and the other sciences of war; that the Prince may, from youth
up-</p>
<p>wards, be trained to act as officer and general. . . . Stamp into
my</p>
<p>son a true love for the profession of soldier; and impress upon him
that as there is nothing in the world which can bring a prince renown
and honor like the sword, so he would be a despised creature before all
men if he did not love it and seek his sole glory therein . 31</p>
<p>Had the father lived long enough, he would have been proud of his son
as soldier and general; but in those apprentice years everything seemed
to go wrong. The boy was bright, but he never bothered to spell. He
despised the German language, loved the language, literature, music, and
art of France; he liked to write French verses, and continued that
diversion to the end of his life. The old King fumed when he saw his son
with French books, and still more when he found him playing the flute.
Johann Quantz, flutist at the court of Saxony, came to Berlin to teach
the boy clandestinely at the mother’s request. Hearing the King
approach, Quantz hid in a closet, and Frederick quickly changed from
French robe to military coat; but the sire flew into a rage at the
French books lying about. He ordered the serv- ants to send these to a
bookseller; better to sell them than to burn them. The servants did
neither; they hid the books, and soon returned them to the Prince.</p>
<p>The old man did his angry loving best to make the boy a warrior. He
took him along on hunts, hardened him with outdoor life, accustomed him
to danger and rough riding, made him subsist on scrimped food and short
sleep, put him in charge of a regiment, taught him to drill his men, to
mount a battery, and to fire cannon. Frederick learned all this, and
showed courage enough; but the father saw with rising anger that the
youth, now sixteen, was developing a suspicious intimacy with two young
officers, Captain von Katte and Lieutenant Keith. Katte had read and
traveled widely, and, though smallpox had marked him, his “refinement of
mind and manners,” said Wilhelmine, made him “a most agreeable
companion. . . . He boasted of being an esprit fort 〔freethinker〕. It
was K atte’s influ - ence that destroyed all religious belief in my
brother .” 82</p>
<p>To these unorthodox developments in his oldest son Frederick William
could find no other response than rage and violence. He was accustomed
to</p>
<p>CHAP. XIXl) FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA 441</p>
<p>use his cane upon his servants; he threatened to use it against his
son. Mean- while Wilhelmine was resisting his plans to marry her to some
potential political ally; son and daughter seemed fated to disappoint
all his hopes. “The King’s anger against my brother and myself reached
such a pitch that, with the exception of the hours for our meals, we
were banished from his presence.” At one meeting the King</p>
<p>threw his plate at my brother’s head, who could have been struck had
he not gotten out of the way; a second he threw at me, which I also
happily escaped; then torrents of abuse followed. … As my brother</p>
<p>and I passed near him to leave the room, he hit out at us with his
crutch.</p>
<p>He never saw my brother without threatening him with his stick. Fritz
often said to me that he would bear all ill treatment save blows, and
that if it came to these he would run away. 33</p>
<p>We can understand something of the anger felt by the aging King. He
had looked forward to leaving his reorganized realm to a son who would
continue to foster the army, economize expenditures, build industries,
and administer the state with conscience and application; he could not
be ex- pected to foresee that this son would do all these and more. In
Friedrich he found only an insolent and effeminate youth who curled his
hair like a Frenchman instead of cutting it off like a Prussian soldier;
34 who hated soldiers and hunting, laughed at religion, wrote French
poems, and played the flute. What future could Prussia have under such a
weakling? Even the boy’s occasional pleas for forgiveness could be
interpreted as coward - ice. Once, after boxing his son’s ears, the King
said to others that had he been treated so by his father he would have
shot himself, but that Friedrich had no sense of honor, and would put up
with anything. 35</p>
<p>At Potsdam in the spring of 1730, if we may believe Frederick’s
report to Wilhelmine, the King tried to kill him.</p>
<p>He sent for me one morning. As I entered the room he seized me by the
hair and threw me to the ground. After having beaten me with his fists
he dragged me to the window and tied the curtain cord around my throat.
I had fortunately time to get up and seize his hands, but as he pulled
with all his might at the cord around my throat, I felt I was being
strangled, and screamed for help. A page rushed to my assistance, and
had to use force to free me. 38</p>
<p>Friedrich, now eighteen, confided to Wilhelmine that he was planning
to escape to England with Katte and Keith. She pleaded with him not to
go; he persisted. She kept his secret fearfully, but the King, who sur-
rounded his son with spies, learned of the plot, and arrested son and
daugh- ter, Katte and Keith (August, 1730). Wilhelmine was soon
released, and Keith escaped to England, but Friedrich and Katte were
court-martialed</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>and were condemned to death (October 30). Katte was executed in the
yard of the fortress at Ciistrin (now Kostrzyn in Poland), and
Friedrich, on his father’s orders, was forced to witness the execution
from the win - dows of his cell (November 6). The King thought of having
his son be- headed, and making the next-older son crown prince; but,
fearing interna- tional repercussions, he reconciled himself to letting
Friedrich live.</p>
<p>From November, 1730, till February, 1732, the Prince remained in
Ciis- trin, at first in close confinement, then restricted to the town,
always under close surveillance; but, says Wilhelmine, “all Berlin sent
him provisions, and even the greatest delicacies.” 37 On August 15,
1731, after a year of separation, the King came to see his son, berated
him at length, and told him that if the plot to escape had succeeded “I
would have cast your sister for life into a place where she never would
have seen sun or moon again.” 38 Friedrich knelt and asked forgiveness;
the old man broke down, wept, and embraced him; Friedrich kissed his
father’s feet . 39 He was released, and was sent on a tour of the
Prussian provinces to study their economy and ad- ministration. Those
years of filial strife changed and hardened his character.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wilhelmine, glad to leave the paternal roof, accepted the
hand of Crown Prince Henry of Bayreuth. After their marriage in Berlin
(November 30, 1731) she went south, to become (1734) the margravine of
Bayreuth, and to make her court hum with culture. It was during her sway
there that the princely residence, the Schloss der Eremitage, was trans-
formed into one of the loveliest chateaux in Germany.</p>
<p>Friedrich too had to be married, willy-nilly. He resented the
necessity, and threatened: “If the King absolutely will have it, I will
marry to obey him; after that I will shove my wife into a corner and
live after my own fancy.” 40 So he took to the altar (June 12, 1733)
Elisabeth Christina, “Se - rene Princess” of Brunswick -Bevern, he
twenty- one, she eighteen, “very handsome,” said Friedrich’s mother to
Wilhelmine, but “as stupid as a bundle of straw — I cannot understand
how your brother will get on with such a goose.” 41 Though in later
years Frederick learned to esteem her highly, in this period he left her
mostly to her own resources. They went to live at Rheinsberg, a few
miles north of Berlin. There the bachelor hus- band built himself a
tower of refuge, performed experiments in physics and chemistry,
gathered scientists, scholars, and musicians around him, and cor-
responded with Wolff, Fontenelle, Maupertuis, and Voltaire.</p>

<p>His correspondence with Voltaire is among the most revealing docu-
ments of that time: a brilliant literary expression of two pre-eminent

<p>CHAP. XIIl) FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA 443</p>
<p>sonalities, in which the art of the older man fades before the
realism of the maturing youth. Voltaire was now forty-two, Frederick was
twenty-four. Voltaire was the acknowledged head of French writers, yet
it almost turned his head to receive, from a crown prince soon to be
king, the following letter, written from Berlin on August 8, 1736, and
sent by private messen- ger to the poet at Cirey:</p>
<p>Monsieur:</p>
<p>Although I have not the satisfaction of knowing you personally,
you</p>
<p>are not the less known to me through your works. They are treasures
of the mind, if I may so express myself; and they reveal to the reader
new beauties at every fresh perusal. … If ever the dispute on the</p>
<p>comparative merits of the Moderns and the Ancients should be re-</p>
<p>vived, the modem great men will owe it to you, and to you only, that
the scale is turned in their favor. . . . Never before did poet put
meta- physics into rhythmic cadence; to you the honor was reserved of
doing it first.</p>
<p>Frederick, perhaps because of his little Latin, had obviously not yet
en- countered Lucretius. But he had read Wolff, and he dispatched to
Vol- taire a</p>
<p>copy of the Accusation and Defense of M. Wolff, the most celebrated
philosopher of our days; who, for having carried light into the darkest
places of metaphysics, is cruelly accused of irreligion and atheism.</p>
<p>… I am getting a translation made of Wolff’s Treatise on God ,
the</p>
<p>Soul and the World. … I will send it to you. . . .</p>
<p>The kindness and assistance you afford to all who devote themselves
to the arts and sciences make me hope that you will not exclude me from
the number of those whom you find worthy of your instruc-</p>
<p>tions. . . .</p>
<p>Apparently Frederick had heard some rumor of La Pucelle:</p>
<p>Monsieur, there is nothing I wish so much as to possess all your
writ- ings. … If there be among your manuscripts any that you wish
to</p>
<p>conceal from the eyes of the public, I engage to keep them in the
pro- foundest secrecy. . . .</p>
<p>Nature, when she pleases, forms a great soul endowed with faculties
that can advance the arts and sciences; and it is the part of princes to
recompense his noble toil. Ah, would Glory but make use of me to</p>
<p>crown your success! . . .</p>
<p>If my destiny refuse me the happiness of being able to possess
you,</p>
<p>may I at least hope one day to see the man whom I have admired so
long now from afar; and to assure you, by word of mouth, that I am —</p>

<p>with all the esteem and consideration due to those who, following the
torch of truth for guide, consecrate their labors to the Public — mon-
sieur, your affectionate friend,</p>
<p>Frederic, P. R. of Prussia . 42</p>
<p>We can imagine the satisfaction with which Voltaire, never too old to
be vain, read this letter, sipping its honey before the already jealous
Mar- quise. Soon after its receipt he replied, August 26, 1736:</p>
<p>Monseigneur:</p>
<p>A man must be devoid of all feeling who would not be infinitely</p>
<p>moved by the letter with which your Royal Highness has deigned to</p>
<p>honor me. My self-love is only too much flattered by it; but my love
of mankind, which I have always nourished in my heart, and which, I</p>
<p>venture to say, forms the basis of my character, has given me a very
much purer pleasure — to see that there is now in the world a Prince who
thinks as a man, a Philosopher Prince, who will make men happy.</p>
<p>Permit me to say, there is not a man on earth but owes you thanks</p>
<p>for the care you take to cultivate by sound philosophy a soul that
is</p>
<p>bom for command. Good kings there never were except those that had
begun by seeking to instruct themselves; by knowing good men from bad,
by loving what is true, by detesting persecution and superstition.</p>
<p>A prince persisting in such thoughts might bring back the Golden Age
to his country! Why do so few princes seek this glory? . . . Because</p>
<p>thejrthink more of their royalty than of mankind. Precisely the
reverse is your case; and unless, one day, the tumult of business and
the wick- edness of men alters so divine a character * you will be
worshiped by your people, and loved by the whole world. Philosophers
worthy of</p>
<p>the name will flock to your state; thinkers will crowd around
your</p>
<p>throne. . . . The illustrious Queen Christina left her kingdom to go
in search of the arts; so reign, Monseigneur, and the arts will come to
seek you. . . .</p>
<p>I cannot sufficiently thank your Royal Highness for the gift of
that</p>
<p>little book about Monsieur Wolff. I respect metaphysical ideas; they
are rays of light amid deep night. More, I think, is not to be hoped</p>
<p>from metaphysics. It does not seem likely that the first principles
of things will ever be known. The mice that must be in some little holes
of an immense building know not whether it is eternal, or who the</p>
<p>architect is, or why he built it. Such mice are we; and the
Divine</p>
<p>Architect who built the universe has never, that I know of, told
his</p>
<p>secret to one of us. . . .</p>
<p>I shall obey your commands as to sending those unpublished
pieces.</p>
<p>You shall be my public, Monseigneur, your criticisms will be my
re-</p>
<p>ward; it is a price few sovereigns can pay. I am sure of your
secrecy.</p>

<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>445</p>
<p>… I should indeed consider it a precious happiness to come to pay</p>
<p>my court to your Royal Highness. . . . But the friendship which</p>
<p>keeps me in this retirement does not permit my leaving it.
Without</p>
<p>doubt you think with Julian, that great and much calumniated man,</p>
<p>who said, “Friends should always be preferred to kings.”</p>
<p>In whatever comer of the world I may end my life, be assured, Mon-
seigneur, my wishes will continually be for you — that is to say, for a
whole people’s happiness. My heart will rank itself among your sub -
jects; your glory will ever be dear to me. I shall wish that you may</p>
<p>always be like yourself, and that other kings may be like you. — I
am, with profound respect, your Royal Highness’s most humble</p>
<p>Voltaire 43</p>
<p>The correspondence between the greatest king and the greatest writer
of the time continued, with bitter interruptions, for forty-two years.
Almost every word of it repays reading, for it is not often that we are
privileged to hear the private and considered conversation of two such
men. We resist with difficulty the temptation to quote the illuminating
judgments, the strokes of wit, in those letters; but some passages help
us to visualize the rival giants of sword and pen. #</p>
<p>They agree, at first, in mutual admiration. Frederick expresses
astonish- ment that France has not recognized “the treasure enclosed in
its heart,” that it allows Voltaire to “live solitary in the deserts of
Champagne. . . .</p>
<p>Henceforth Cirey shall be my Delphi, and your letters my oracles .”
44 “Leave your ungrateful country, and come to a land where you will be
adored .” 45 Voltaire throws the bouquets back: “You think like Trajan,
you write like Pliny, you use French like our best writers. . . . Under
your auspices Berlin will be the Athens of Germany, perhaps of Europe .”

<p>urally inclined to evil, and they are good only in proportion to the
extent that education and experience have modified their impetuosity.”
52</p>
<p>Two events marked the last years of Frederick’s tutelage. In 1738 he
joined the Freemasons. 53 In 1739, apparently in the warmth of
Voltaire’s in - fluence, he wrote a small book, Refutation du Prince de
Machiavel, which took the Italian philosopher to task for apparently
justifying any means that a ruler might think necessary to the
preservation or strengthening of his state. No, countered the new
Prince; the only true principle of govern- ment is the loyalty, justice,
and honor of the sovereign. The royal philoso- pher expressed his scorn
for kings who preferred “the fatal glory of con - querors to that won by
kindness, justice, and clemency”; he wondered what could induce a man to
aggrandize himself through the misery and destruction of other men.” 54
Frederick proceeded:</p>
<p>Machiavelli has not understood the true nature of the sovereign.</p>
<p>. . . Far from being the absolute master of those who are under
his</p>
<p>rule, he is only the first of their servants 〔le premier
domestique〕, and should be the instrument of their welfare, as they are
the instrument of his glory . 55</p>
<p>And, probably again following Voltaire, Frederick praised the English
constitution:</p>
<p>It seems to me that if a form of government may be held up as a</p>
<p>model for our days, it is the English. There Parliament is the
supreme judge of both the people and the king, while the king has full
power of doing good, but none of doing evil . 56</p>
<p>We find no sign of insincerity in these professions; they are
repeated time and again in Frederick’s letters of this period. He sent
the manuscript</p>
<p>Frederick William I remained almost to the end the gnarled oak that
he had so long been, scolding, denouncing, laying down the law in his
striking way. Only when the court preacher told him that he was dying
and must forgive his enemies if he wished pardon from God, did he
reluctantly make his peace with the world. In his last moments he sent
for Friedrich, em- braced him, and wept; perhaps after all this willful
youth had ki him the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>makings of a king? “Am I not happy,” he asked the generals around his
bed, “to have such a son to leave behind me?” 57 And the son may have
understood better now the old man’s feeling that a monarch must have
some iron in his blood.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1740, Frederick William I, worn out at fifty-one, yielded
up his life and his throne. Anti-Machiavel was king.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE NEW MACHIAVELLI</li>
</ol>
<p>Frederick II was twenty-eight years old at his accession. As painted
by Antoine Pesne a year before, he was still the musician and
philosopher despite his shining armor: handsome and kindly features, big
blue-gray eyes, lofty brow; “a natural and charming manner,” reported
the French ambassador, “a soft and ingratiating voice.” 58 He was still
the pupil of Vol - taire. To him he wrote, after six days of rule:</p>
<p>My lot is changed. I have witnessed the last moments of a king,
his</p>
<p>agony, his death. On coming to the throne I had no need of that
lesson to be disgusted with the vanity of human grandeur. … I beg
you</p>
<p>will see in me nothing but a zealous citizen, a rather skeptical
philoso- pher, and a really faithful friend. For God’s sake, write to me
as a man, and, like me, scorn titles, names, and all exterior pomp.
59</p>
<p>And three weeks later, again to Voltaire:</p>
<p>The infinite amount of work which has fallen to my lot scarcely</p>
<p>leaves time for my real grief. I feel that since losing my father I
owe</p>
<p>myself wholly to my country. With this view I have worked to the</p>
<p>limit of my capacity to make the promptest arrangements, and those
most suitable to the public good. 60</p>
<p>It was true. On the second day of his reign, judging from the cold
spring that the harvest would be late and poor, he ordered that the
public gran- aries be opened, and that grain be sold to the poor at
reasonable rates. On the third day he abolished throughout Prussia the
use of torture in criminal trials — twenty- four years before Beccaria’s
epochal treatise; we should add that judicial torture, though permitted
by law, had in practice become ob- solete under Frederick William I, and
that Frederick for a moment re- lapsed into its use in one case in 175
2. 61 In 1757 he commissioned Samuel von Cocceji, chief of the Prussian
judiciary, to supervise an extensive re- form of Prussian law.</p>
<p>The influence of philosophy appeared in other actions of this first
month.</p>
<p>44® THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIH</p>
<p>On June 22 Frederick issued a simple order: “All religions must be
tol - erated, and the government must see to it that none of them makes
un- just encroachments on any other, for in this country every man must
get to heaven in his own way.” 62 He issued no official order about
freedom of the press, but in practice he allowed it, telling his
ministers, “La presse est libre .” He bore with contemptuous silence a
thousand diatribes that were published against him. 83 Once, seeing a
lampoon against him posted in the street, he had it removed to a
position where it could be more easily read. “My people and I,” he said,
“have come to an agreement that satisfies us both: they are to say what
they please, and 7 am to do what I please.” 64 But the freedom was by no
means complete; as Frederick became more and more the Great he allowed
no public criticism of his military measures or his tax decrees. He
remained an absolute monarch, though he tried to keep his measures
consistent with the laws.</p>
<p>He made no attempt to change the structure of Prussian society or
gov- ernment. The administrative boards and agencies remained as before,
ex- cept that Frederick kept a closer eye on them and joined more
assiduously in their work; he became a member of his own b ureaucracy.
“He begins his government,” said the French ambassador, “in a highly
satisfactory way: everywhere traits of benevolence, sympathy for his
subjects.” 65 This did not extend to mitigating serfdom; the Prussian
peasant continued to be worse off than the French. The nobles retained
their privileges.</p>
<p>The influence of Voltaire joined with the tradition of Leibniz in
bring- ing about a vigorous revival of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
Founded by Frederick I ( 1 70 1 ) , it had been neglected by Frederick
William I. Fred- erick II now made it the most prominent in Europe. We
have seen that he recalled Wolff from exile; Wolff wanted to head the
Academy, but he was too old, weak in the legs, and a bit stooping to
orthodoxy; Frederick wanted an esprit fort, a man abreast of the latest
in science, and unimpeded by theology. At Voltaire’s suggestion (later
mourned) he invited (June, 1 740) Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, now
in the summer of life, and fresh from a famous expedition to Lapland to
measure a degree of latitude. Maupertuis came and received lavish
support; he built a great laboratory, and performed experiments
sometimes in the presence of the King and the court. Goldsmith, who must
have known the Royal Society of London, judged the Berliner Akademie der
Weissenschaften to “excel any other</p>
<p>All this warmed the heart of Voltaire. When Frederick had occasion to
visit Cleves he invited his philosopher to meet him; Voltaire, then at
Brus- sels, tore himself away from his fretful Marquise, and traveled 1
50 miles to the Schloss Moyland; there the new Plato saw his Dionysius
for the first time, and spent three days (September 11 to 14, 1740) in
ecstasy, spoiled</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII )</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>only by the presence of Algarotti and Maupertuis. To M. de Cideville,
in a letter of October 1 8, he gave his view of Frederick:</p>
<p>It was there I saw one of the most amiable men in the world, who</p>
<p>forms the charm of society, who would be everywhere sought after if
he were not king; a philosopher without austerity, full of sweetness,
complaisance, and obliging ways; not remembering that he is a king when
he meets his friends. … I needed an effort of memory to rec-</p>
<p>ollect that I here saw sitting at the foot of my bed a sovereign
who</p>
<p>had an army of 100,000 men. 67</p>
<p>And Frederick was equally pleased. To his aide Jordan he wrote, on
Sep- tember 24:</p>
<p>I have seen that Voltaire whom I was so curious to know; but I
saw</p>
<p>him with the quartan fever hanging on me, and my mind as unstrung as
my body. . . . He has the eloquence of Cicero, the mildness of</p>
<p>Pliny, the wisdom of Agrippa; he combines, in short, what is to
be</p>
<p>collected of virtues and talents from three of the greatest men
of</p>
<p>antiquity. His intellect is at work incessantly; every drop of ink is
an</p>
<p>extract of wit from his pen. … La Chatelet is lucky to have him;
for</p>
<p>of the good things he flings out at random a person who had no
faculty but memory might make a brilliant book. 68</p>
<p>On returning to Berlin Frederick noted that he had an army of 100,000
men. On October 20 Charles VI died, and a young woman with a second-
class army became head of the Austro-Hungarian empire. On that very day
Frederick sent an ominous letter to Voltaire: “The death of the Em -
peror alters all my pacific ideas, and I think that in June it will be
rather a matter of cannon and powder, soldiers and trenches, than of
actresses, balls, and stages; so That I am obliged to cancel the bargain
we were about to make.” 69</p>
<p>Voltaire’s heart ached. Was his pupil a warmonger like any other
king? Taking advantage of Frederick’s invitation to visit him in Berlin,
he de - cided to see what he could do for peace. At the same time he
might repair his fences at Versailles, for Cardinal Fleury, still at the
helm in France, also wanted peace. On November 2 he wrote to the
Cardinal, offering his serv- ices as a secret agent of France in an
effort to win Frederick back to philos- ophy. Fleury accepted the offer,
but gently reproved the new diplomat for his impetuous sallies against
religion: “You have been young, and per - haps a little too long 〔Vous
avez ete jeune, et peut-etre un peu trop long- temps 〕.“ 70 In another
letter of the same date (November 14) the amiable Cardinal acknowledged
receipt of the Anti-Machiavel from Mme. du Chatelet, and praised it with
judicious suspicion of its authorship:</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Whoever may be the author of this work, if he is not a prince he de-
serves to be one; and the little that I have read of it is so wise, so
reason- able, and expresses principles so admirable, that the author
would be worthy to command other men, provided he has the courage to put
them in practice. If he was born a prince, he contracts a very solemn
engagement with the public; and the Emperor Antoninus would not have
acquired the immortal glory which he retains, age after age, if he had
not sustained by the justice of his government the exquisite moral- ity
of which he had given such instructive lessons to all sovereigns.</p>
<p>… I should be infinitely touched if his Prussian Majesty could
find</p>
<p>in my conduct some conformity with his principles, but I can at least
assure you that I regard his as the outline of the most perfect and glo-
rious government. 71</p>
<p>Voltaire, having arranged that all his traveling expenses should be
paid by Frederick, crossed Germany for the first time, and spent almost
two weeks with the King at Rheinsberg, Potsdam, and Berlin (November 20
to December 2). He made the mistake of showing to Frederick the Cardi-
nal’s letter about the Anti -Machiavel; Frederick saw at once that
Voltaire was playing diplomat; he translated Fl eury’s beautiful
commendation into an appeal for co-operation with France; and he was
irked to find himself hampered by his essay in philosophy. He exchanged
verses and repartee with Voltaire, treated him to performances on the
flute, and sent him away with nothing more definite than thanks for the
quinine with which the poet had mitigated the royal ague. To Jordan, on
November 28, Frederick wrote, not naming but meaning Voltaire: “Thy
Miser shall drink to the lees of his insatiable desire to enrich
himself; he shall have three thousand thalers. This is paying dear for a
fool 〔c’est bien payer pour un fou 〕 ; never did court jester have
such wages before.” 72 Apparently the sum included both Voltaire’s
travel ing expenses — which Frederick had probably volun- teered to
remit — and the cost of publishing the Anti-Machiavel, which Vol- taire
had advanced out of his own pocket. When money comes in, love goes out;
Frederick did not relish paying the expenses of a French agent, or the
costs of a book which he would gladly have paid the world to forget.</p>
<p>The influence of Frederick William now outweighed the teachings of
the philosopher. As the opportunities of power and the responsibilities
of rule replaced the music and poetry of his princely years, Frederick
grew colder and harder; even the maltreatment which his father had
lavished upon him had toughened his skin and his temperament. Every day
he saw those 100,000 giants his father had left him; every day he had to
feed them. What sense was there in letting them rust and rot in peace?
Was there not some wrong that these giants could right? Certainly. There
was Silesia, separated from Austria by Bohemia, and much closer to
Berlin than to</p>
<p>CHAP. XIII ) FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA 45 1</p>
<p>Vienna; the great River Oder ran down from Prussia to Silesia’s
capital, Breslau, only 183 miles southeast of Berlin; what were the
Austrians doing there? The house of Brandenburg had claims in Silesia —
to the former prin- cipalities of Jagerndorf, Ratibor, Oppeln, Liegnitz,
Brieg, Wohlau; all these had been taken by Austria, or had been ceded to
it by arrangements never satisfactory to Prussia. Now that the Austrian
succession was in dispute, and Maria Theresa was young and weak, and an
infant Czar, Ivan VI, was on the Russian throne — now was the time to
urge those old claims, to rec- tify those old mistakes, and to give
Prussia some greater geographical unity and base.</p>
<p>On November 1 Frede rick asked Podewils, one of his councilors, “I
give you a problem to solve: When one has the advantage, should one make
use of it or not? I am ready with my troops and with everything else. If
I do not use them now I keep in my hands a powerful but useless
instrument. If I use my army it will be said that I have had the skill
to take advantage of the superiority which I have over my neighbor.”
Podewils suggested that</p>
<p>In December Frederick sent an envoy to Maria Theresa to offer her his
protection if she would recognize his claims to a part of Silesia.
Expecting that the offer would be rejected, he ordered a part of his
army, thirty thou- sand men, to advance. It crossed the border into
Silesia December 23, two days before Frederick’s envoy reached Vienna.
So began the First Silesian War (1740-42), the first phase of</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION: 1 740-48</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall not follow Frederick in all his military moves; this is a
history of civilization. We are interested, however, in the nature of
man and the conduct of states as revealed by the words and actions of
Frederick, and the shifting policies of the Powers. Probably in no
recorded war were the realities of power politics so visibly bared.</p>
<p>The Prussian army moved almost unresisted through Silesia. The
Protes- tant half of the population, which had suffered some persecution
under</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Austrian rule, welcomed Frederick as a liberator; 74 to the Catholics
he pledged — and gave — full freedom to practice their faith. On January
3, 1741, he took peaceful possession of Breslau; “no house,” he assures
us, “was pillaged, no citizen was insulted, and Prussian discipline
shone in all its splendor”; 75 it was the most genteel appropriation.
Maria Theresa or - dered Marshal Neipperg to collect an army in Moravia
and cross into Silesia. On April 10 this army en gaged Frederick’s main
Silesian force at Mollwitz, twenty miles southeast of Breslau. Neipperg
had 8,600 cavalry, 11,400 infantry, eighteen guns; Frederick had 4,000
cavalry, 16,000 in- fantry, sixty guns; these differences determined the
phases and issues of the battle. The Austrian horsemen overwhelmed the
Prussian cavalry, which turned and fled. Marshal Schwerin persuaded
Frederick to join in the flight, lest he be captured and held for a
ruinous ransom. But after the King and his cavalry had gone, the
Prussian infantry withstood all attacks of horse or foot; and the
Prussian artillery, reloading their guns with iron ramrods, so damaged
the Austrians that Neipperg ordered retreat. Frederick, called back to
the scene, was delighted and ashamed to find the battle won. He felt
that he had been guilty not only of cowardice but of defective strategy;
he had scattered his thirty thousand men through Silesia before
consolidating his conquest; and only the courage and training of his
infantry had saved the day. “He reflected a great deal,” said his
Memoirs , “on the faults he had committed, and tried to correct them in
the sequel.” 76 He was never want - ing again in bravery, and rarely in
tactics or strategy.</p>
<p>The news of her army’s defeat reached Maria Theresa as she was re-
cuperating from the birth of her child. In the weakened condition of her
forces and her finances her only hope seemed to lie in aid from abroad.
She appealed to the many powers that had pledged their support to the
Pragmatic Sanction of her rule. England responded cautiously; it needed
a strong Austria as a foil to France, but George II feared for his
Hanoverian principality if he warred against neighboring Prussia.
Parliament voted a subsidy of £ 300,000 to Maria Theresa, but British
envoys urged her to cede Lower (northern) Silesia to Frederick as a
price of peace. Frederick was willing, the Queen refused. Poland, Savoy,
and the Dutch Republic promised help, but were so slow in sending it
that they counted for little in the result.</p>
<p>Every coalition begets its opposite. France, watching the
rapprochement of her ancient enemies, England and Austria, hurried to
form an alliance with Bavaria, Prussia, and Bourbon Spain. We have seen
that France had her own Machiavelli, Belle-Isle, who proposed a gem of
political brig- andage. France, which had pledged to support the
Pragmatic Sanction, was to take swift advantage of Maria Theresa’s
plight: Charles Albert of Bavaria was to be upheld in his claim, through
his wife, to the Imperial</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>453</p>
<p>throne; France was to offer him money and troops to join in attacking
Austria; if the plan prospered, Maria Theresa was to be restricted to
Hun- gary, Lower Austria, and the Austrian Netherlands; Charles was to
be em- peror, ruling Bavaria, Upper Austria, the Tirol, Bohemia, and
part of</p>
<p>Swabia; the second son of the King of Spain was to have the Milanese.
Fleury opposed the scheme, Belle-Isle prevailed, and was sent off to win
Frederick to the conspiracy. France and Bavaria signed their alliance at
Nymphenburg on May 18, 1741. Frederick was reluctant to join; he could
not afford to let France become so strong; he still hoped to come to an
ar- rangement with Maria Theresa; but when she offered him only
negligible concessions, he signed at Breslau on June 5 an alliance with
France, Bavaria, and Spain; if the Austrian dominions were to be divided
he wished to share in the spoils. Each signatory pledged his government
to make no secret separate peace. France guaranteed Frederick’s
possession of Breslau and Lower Silesia, promised to prod Sweden into a
holding war with Russia, and agreed to send a French army to prevent
England’s Hanoverian fo rces from entering the game.</p>
<p>Left almost friendless, Maria Theresa resolved to appeal to the
martial lords of Hungary. Those lords, or their ancestors, had suffered
much under Austrian rule; Leopold I had deprived them of their old
constitution and traditional rights; they had little reason to love or
succor his granddaughter. But when she appeared before them in their
Diet at Pressburg (September 11, 1741), they were moved by her beauty
and tears. She addressed them in Latin, confessed herself abandoned by
her allies, and declared that her honor and her throne now depended upon
the valor and chivalry of Hungarian knights and arms. That the nobles
cried out, “ Moriamur pro rege nostro ” 77 — “Let us die for our King!”
(for so they called the Quee n) — is a fine story now relegated to
legend; 78 they bargained considerably, and drew from her many political
concessions; but when, on September 21, her husband Francis Stephen
came, with a nurse holding up to them the six-month-old Joseph, they
responded gallantly, and many cried out, “ Vitam et sanguinem !”— vowing
their lives and blood. 79 A levy en masse was voted, calling all men to
arms, and after many delays a Hungarian force rode westward to the
defense of the Queen.</p>
<p>It would have been too late to save Vienna if Charles Albert had con-
tinued his march upon that capital. But meanwhile (September 19) Saxony
had joined the alliance against Austria; Charles Albert feared that
Augustus III would seize Bohemia; Fleury advised the Bavarian to take
Bohemia be- fore the Saxons could get to it. Frederick urged Charles to
continue on to Vienna; Charles, financed by France, obeyed France.
Frederick, fearing that a France dominant in both Bavaria and Bohemia
would be too strong for Prussia’s security, signed a secret truce with
Austria (October 9, 1741);</p>
<p>454 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Maria Theresa, anxious to save Bohemia, provisionally ceded to him
Lower Silesia.</p>
<p>Three armies now converged upon Prague: one under Charles Albert, a
French force under Belle-Isle, and twenty thousand Saxons. Poorly gar-
risoned, the Bohemian capital fell at the first assault (November 25).
The victory was a disaster for Charles. Absorbed in the Bohemian
campaign, he had left his electorate of Bavaria with only minor
defenses, never dream- ing that Maria Theresa, harassed on so many
sides, would be able to take the offensive. But the Queen showed a
resilience that dismayed her enemies. She called back ten thousand
Austrian troops from Italy; Hungarian regi- ments were arriving in
Vienna; these two armies she placed under Count Ludwig von
Khevenhiiller, who had learned the art of war under Eugene of Savoy.
Ably led, they invaded Bavaria and overran it almost unresisted; on
February 12, 1742, they took Munich, its capital. On that same day, at
Frankfurt-am-Main, Charles Albert was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman
Empire as Charles VII.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Frederick, shifting with every turn in the winds of power,
had re-entered the war. He had made the truce conditional on secrecy;
Maria Theresa revealed it to France; Frederick overheard these
diplomatic whisperings, and hastened to rejoin his allies (December,
1741). He con- certed with them a plan by which he would lead an army
through Moravia into Lower Austria; he was to be met there by Saxon and
Franco-Bavarian forces; together they were to march upon Vienna. But he
was now operat- ing amid an actively hostile population, and Hungarian
cavalrymen were raiding his lines of communication with Silesia. He
turned back and entered Bohemia. There, near Chotusitz, his rear guard
was attacked by an Aus- trian army under Prince Charles Alexander of
Lorraine (May 17, 1742). The Prince, brother-in-law to Maria Theresa,
was a youth of thirty years, one of the most brilliant and gallant of
his line, but he could not match Frederick in the tactics of battle.
Each had some twenty-eight thousand men. Frederick’s advance guard
returned to the scene just in time; he di- rected its full force against
an exposed flank of the Austrians; they fell back in orderly retreat.
Both armies suffered heavy losses, but the result con- vinced Maria
Theresa that she could not deal with all her foes at once. She accepted
the advice of the English envoys to make a definite peace with
Frederick; and this time, by the Treaty of Berlin (July 28, 1742),
she</p>
<p>ceded to him nearly all of Silesia. So ended the First Silesian
War.</p>
<p>The Austrian armies of Khevenhiiller and Prince Charles Alexander</p>
<p>now moved into Bohemia. The French garrison in Prague faced encircle-
ment and starvation. To prevent this reductio ad absurdum of Belle-
Isle’s dreams, France ordered Marshal Maillebois to lead into Bohemia
the army that had been holding the forces of George II in Hanover. So
freed, Eng-</p>

<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>455</p>
<p>land entered actively into the war, advanced £ 500,000 to Maria
Theresa, and dispatched sixteen thousand troops to Austrian Flanders;
and the United Provinces contributed 840,000 florins. The Queen
transmuted the money into armies. One of these blocked Maillebois’
advance toward Bo - hemia. Austrian forces, repeatedly augmented,
converged upon Prague. Belle-Isle and most of his men escaped to Eger,
at great cost. Maria Theresa came up from Vienna to Prague, and there at
last (May 12, 1743) she was crowned queen of Bohemia.</p>
<p>Everywhere now she seemed triumphant. In that same May the United
Provinces voted her twenty thousand troops. A month later her English
allies defeated her French foes at Dettingen. Control of the
Mediterranean by the English navy advanced her cause in Italy; on
September 1 3 Charles Emmanuel I, King of Sardinia, joined in alliance
with Austria and Eng- land; he received a slice of Lombardy from Austria
and a pledge of</p>
<p>j£ 200,000 a year from England, in return for 45,000 troops; so
soldiers were bought in gross, kings in retail. Maria Theresa, as
intransigent in vic- tory as she had been heroic in adversity, dreamed
now not only of regain- ing Silesia but of absorbing into her empire
Bavaria, Alsace, and Lorraine.</p>
<p>Frederick for a while played with peace. He opened a new opera house
in Berlin, wrote poetry, fingered the flute. He renewed his invitations
to Voltaire; Voltaire answered that he was still loyal to fimilie. But
at this juncture the French ministry, alarmed to find France at war with
England, Austria, the Dutch Republic, and Savoy-Sardinia, bethought
itself that Frederick’s genius and giants would be a welcome aid; that
his violations of his treaties with France could be forgiven if he would
violate his treaty with Austria; and that he might be persuaded to see,
in Austria’s resur - rected might, a threat to his hold on Silesia, even
on Prussia. Who could best explain this to him? Why not try Voltaire,
already holding an invita- tion from Frederick, and always itching to
play politics?</p>
<p>So Voltaire the pacifist again bounced and swayed across Germany, and
spent six weeks there (August 30 to October 12, 1743) trying to persuade
Frederick to war. The King would not commit himself; he sent the
philoso- pher away with nothing but compliments. But as the campaigns of
1744 proceeded he began to fear for his own security and the permanence
of his gains. On August 1 5 he opened the Second Silesian War.</p>
<p>He proposed to begin by conquering Bohemia. As Saxony lay between
Berlin and Prague, he marched his troops through Dresden, infuriating
the absent Augustus III. By September 2 his eighty thousand men were at
the gates of Prague; on September 1 6 the Austrian garrison surrendered.
Leav- ing five thousand men to hold the Bohemian capital, Frederick
moved south, again threatening Vienna. Maria Theresa reacted defiantly;
she rode in haste to Pressburg and asked the Hungarian Diet for another
levy of</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>troops; it gathered 44,000 for her, and soon added thirty thousand
more. She ordered Prince Charles to abandon his attack upon Alsace and
lead the main Austrian army eastward to intercept the Prussians.
Frederick expected the French to pursue the Austrians; they did not. He
tried to force a battle with Charles; the Prince avoided it, but
seconded the efforts of raiders to cut the Prussian lines of
communication with Silesia and Berlin. History repeated itself;
Frederick found his army isolated amid a population fer- vently Catholic
and resourcefully hostile. Hungarian troops were coming to join Prince
Charles. Word came that Saxony had openly entered the war on Austria’s
side. Fearing to be cut off from his own capital and from his sources of
supply. Frederick retreated northward, cursing the French who had failed
him again; he ordered the Prussian garrison to abandon Prague; and on
December 1 3 he returned to Berlin, not so proud as before, and hav- ing
learned that the deceiver may be deceived.</p>
<p>The current ran strongly against him. On January 8, 1745, England,
the United Provinces, and Poland-Saxony signed at Warsaw a pact with
Aus- tria that pledged all signatories to restore to each of them all
that it had possessed in 1739 — therefore to regain Silesia for Maria
Theresa. Augustus III promised thirty thousand men in return for £ 1
50,000 from England and Holland — five pounds per soul. On January 20
Charles VII, so briefly emperor, died, aged forty-eight. In his last
moments he expressed his sor- row for having ruined his country by
aspiring to the Imperial and Bo- hemian thrones; he begged his son
Maximilian Joseph to forgo such pre- tenses, and make peace with the
house of Austria. The new Elector, despite French protests, followed
this advice; on April 22 he resigned all claims to empire, and agreed to
support Duke Francis Stephen for the Imperial crown. Austrian troops
were withdrawn from Bavaria.</p>
<p>The Queen now thought not merely of regaining Silesia but of dismem-
bering Prussia as a guarantee against the ambitions of Frederick. 80 She
was temporarily disconcerted by the French victory over her English
allies at Fontenoy (May 1 1, 1745); but in that month she sent her main
army into Silesia, and ordered it to seek battle. Reinforced by a Saxon
contingent, the Austrians encountered Frederick at Hohenfriedberg (June
4, 1745). Here his skill in tactics saved him; he deployed his cavalry
to capture a hill from which his artillery could rake the enemy
infantry. After seven hours of slaughter the Austrians and Saxons
withdrew, leaving four thousand killed and seven thousand prisoners.
This was the decisive battle of the Silesian Wars.</p>
<p>England again bent her diplomacy to peace. The Jacobite invasion of 1
745 compelled her to withdraw her best troops from Flanders; Marechal de
Saxe took town after town for France, even the main English base at
Ostend; George II feared that the victorious French would reach his
be-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>loved Hanover. The British Parliament, which had deposed Walpole for
loving peace, was now weary of a war that had cost not only thousands of
replaceable men but millions of precious pounds; English envoys pleaded
with Maria Theresa to come to terms with Frederick in order that Aus-
trian and English forces might concentrate upon a France reinvigorated
by a general whose victories almost equaled his amours. The Queen re-
fused. England threatened to withdraw all aid, end all subsidies; she
still refused. England invited Frederick to a conference at Hanover;
there it signed with his representatives a separate peace (August 26,
1745); Eng- land accepted the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, which
confirmed Prus- sian possession of Silesia; Frederick agreed to support
the election of Duke Francis Stephen as emperor. On October 4, at
Frankfurt, Francis was crowned emperor and Maria Theresa became
empress.</p>
<p>She bade her generals continue the war. They fought the Prussians at
Soor in Bohemia (September 30) and at Hennersdorf (November 24) ; the
Austrians, numerically superior, were twice defeated. Meanwhile a Prus-
sian army under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau advanced into Saxony, and at
Kesselsdorf (December 15) overwhelmed the forces protecting Dresden.
Frederick, coming up after the victory, entered Dresden unresisted and
magnanimous; he forbade pillage, and reassured the children of Augustus
III, who had fled to Prague. He offered to withdraw from Saxony if the
Elector-King would join England in recognizing Frederick’s possession of
Silesia, and abandon all aid to Maria Theresa; Augustus consented. Aban-
doned by both England and Saxony, Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of
Dresden (December 25, 1745), ceding Silesia and the county of Glatz to
Prussia. So ended the Second Silesian War.</p>
<p>The War of the Austrian Succession had now lost meaning, but it went
on; France fought Austria and England for dominance in Flanders; France
and Spain fought Austria and Sardinia for dominance in Italy. The
victories of the Austrians in Italy were counterbalanced by those of the
French in the Netherlands. At last financial exhaustion, rather than any
distaste for massacre, persuaded the contestants to peace. By the Treaty
of Aix-la- Chapelle, after negotiations that dragged on from April to
November, 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession came to a sorry end.
Frederick’s seizure of Silesia was confirmed, and was the only
appreciable gain that any of the powers could show for eight years of
competitive destruction. France, despite Saxe’s victories, restored the
southern Netherlands to Aus - tria; it recognized the Hanoverian dynasty
in England, and agreed to expel the Young Pretender from French
soil.</p>
<p>The powers rested for eight years, until the labor of women in child-
birth could replenish the regiments for another round in the game of
kings.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>V. FREDERICK AT HOME: 1745-50</p>
<p>The tired victor returned to Berlin (December 28, 1745 ) vowing “from
this day Peace to the end of my life !” 81 All Europe outside of (and
some souls in) Prussia denounced him as a treacherous, and admired him
as a successful, thief. Voltaire reproved his slaughter and called him
“Great .” 82 Frederick in 1742 had replied to the poet’s protests:</p>
<p>You ask me for how long my colleagues have agreed to ruin the</p>
<p>earth. To this I answer that I have not the slightest knowledge, but
that it is now the fashion to make war, and I presume it will last a
long</p>
<p>time. The Abbe de Saint-Pierre, who distinguishes me sufficiently to
honor me with his correspondence, has sent me a beautiful book on the
way to re-establish peace in Europe and retain it forever. … For the</p>
<p>success of the plan all that is lacking is the consent of Europe and
a few similar trifles. 83</p>
<p>To Europe he made his defense in his posthumous Histoire de mon</p>
<p>temps , adopting Machiavelli’s principle that the interest of the
state over - rides the rules of private morality:</p>
<p>Perhaps posterity will see with surprise, in these memoirs, accounts
of treaties made and broken. Though there are many precedents for such
actions, they would not justify the author of this work if he had no
better reasons to excuse his conduct. The interest of the state must
serve as the rule for sovereigns. Alliances may be broken for any one of
these reasons: ( 1 ) when an ally fails to keep his engagements; (2)
when an ally plans to deceive you, and when you have no other recourse
but to anticipate him; (3) when a major force 〔force majeure〕 lies
upon</p>
<p>you and compels you to break your agreements; (4) when you have no
means for continuing the war. … It seems clear and evident to me</p>
<p>that a private individual must scrupulously keep his word. … If he
is</p>
<p>deceived he can ask for the protection of the laws. . . . But to
what</p>
<p>tribunal can a sovereign have recourse if another prince violates en-
gagements made to him? The word of an individual involves the mis-
fortune of only one man; that of a sovereign may bring a general ca-
lamity to whole nations. All this can be reduced to one question: Is it
better that the people should perish than that the prince should violate
a treaty? What imbecile would hesitate to decide this question? 84</p>
<p>Frederick agreed with Christian theology that man is by nature
wicked. When Sulzer, a school inspector, expressed the opinion that “the
inborn inclination of men is rather to good than to evil,” the King
answered, “Ach,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>mein lieber Sulzer, er kennt nicht diese verdammte Rasse 〔you don’t
know this damned race 〕.” 85 Frederick did not merely accept La
Rochefoucauld’s analysis of human nature as completely egoistic; he
believed that man would recognize no restraints on the pursuit of his
own interest if he were not checked by fear of the police. Since the
state is the individual multi- plied, and is deterred in its collective
egoism by no international police, it can be checked only by fear of the
power of other states. Hence the first duty of “the first servant of the
state” (as Frederick called himself) is to organize the power of the
nation for defense, which includes pre-emptive offense — to do unto
others what they are planning to do unto you. So to Frederick, as to his
father, the army was the foundation of the state. He es- tablished a
carefully supervised and planned economy; he fostered manu- factures and
commerce; he sent agents throughout Europe to import skilled workers,
inventors, industries; but he felt that all this would in the end be of
no avail unless he kept his troops the best-drilled, best-disciplined,
and most reliable army in Europe.</p>
<p>Having such an army, and a well-organized police, he saw no need for
religion as an aid to social order. When Prince William of Brunswick
asked did he not think religion to be one of the best props of a ruler’s
authority, he answered: “I find order and the laws sufficient. . . .
Countries have been adm irably governed when your religion had no
existence .” 86 But he accepted whatever help religion could give him in
inculcating moral senti- ments that contributed to “order.” He protected
all the religions in his realm, but he insisted on naming the Catholic
bishops, especially in Silesia. (Catholic kings also insisted on naming
the Catholic bishops, and the Eng- lish kings named the Anglican
bishops.) Everybody — including Greek Catholics, Mohammedans,
Unitarians, atheists — was to be free to worship as he liked, or not at
all. There was, however, one limitation: when reli- gious controversy
became too abusive or violent Frederick put a damper upon it, as upon
any threat to internal peace. In his later years he was less tolerant of
attacks upon his government than of attacks upon God.</p>
<p>What was he like, this terror of Europe and idol of philosophers?
Five feet six inches tall, he had no commanding height. Rather stout in
his youth, he was now, after ten years of rule and war, slender,
nervous, taut, a wire of electric sensitivity and energy; eyes sharp
with a penetrating and skeptical intelligence. He was capable of humor,
and his wit was as keen as Voltaire’s. As a man unc rossed he could be
quite amiable; as a king he was severe, and seldom tempered justice with
mercy; he could talk philosophy with his associates while calmly
watering soldiers suffering the knout. His cynicism had a biting tongue
that sometimes cut his friends. He was usually parsimonious,
occasionally generous. Accustomed to being obeyed, he be- came
dictatorial, seldom brooking remonstrance, rarely seeking advice,</p>
<p>460</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>never taking it. He was loyal to his intimates, but contemptuous of
man- kind. He spoke seldom to his wife, kept her in financial straits,
tore up be- fore her face the note in which she had humbly stated her
wants. 87 He was normally kind and affectionate to his sister
Wilhelmine, but she too some- times found him coldly reserved. 88 Other
women, except for visiting prin- cesses, he kept at a distance; he had
no taste for feminine graces and charms of body or character, and he
abominated the light chatter of salons. He preferred philosophers and
handsome youths; often he took one of the lat- ter to his rooms after
dinner. 89 Perhaps he liked dogs still better. In his later years his
best-loved companions were his greyhounds; they slept in his bed; he had
monuments raised over their graves, and gave orders that he should be
buried near them. 90 He found it difficult to be at once a success- ful
commander and a lovable man.</p>
<p>In 1747 he suffered an apoplectic stroke and remained unconscious for
half an hour. 91 Thereafter he countered his unsteady health with steady
habits and a frugal regimen. He slept on a thin mattress on a simple
fold- ing bed, and wooed sleep by reading. In these middle years he was
content with five or six hours of sleep per day. He rose at three, four,
or five in the summer, later in winter. He had but one servant to attend
him — chiefly to light his fire and shave him; he scorned kings who had
to be helped to put on their clothes. He was not noted for cleanliness
of person or elegance of dress; he spent half the day in his dressing
gown, half in the uniform of a guardsman. His breakfast began with
several glasses of water; then fol- lowed several cups of coffee, then
some cakes, then much fruit. After breakfast he played the flute,
pondering politics and philosophy while puffing. Every day, about
eleven, he attended the drill and parade of his troops. His main meal,
at noon, was usually mixed with conferences. In the afternoon he became
an author, spending an hour or two in writing poetry or history; we
shall find him an excellent historian of his family and his times. After
several hours given to administration, he relaxed with scientists,
artists, poets, and musicians. At seven in the evening he might take
part as flutist in a concert. At eight-thirty came his famous suppers,
usually (after May, 1747) at Sanssouci. To these he invited his closest
asso- ciates, distinguished visitors, and the leading lights of the
Berlin Academy. He bade them be at their ease, forget that he was king,
and discourse with- out fear, which they did on every subject but
politics. Frederick himself talked abundantly, learnedly, brilliantly.
“His conversation,” said the Prince de Ligne, “was encyclope dic; the
fine arts, war, medicine, literature, religion, philosophy, morals,
history, and legislation passed, turn by turn, in review.” 92 Only one
added ornament was needed to make this a feast of the mind. He came on
July 10, 1750.</p>

</ol>
<p>Even he was satisfied with his reception. Frederick put on Gallic
man- ners to greet him. “He took my hand to kiss it,” Voltaire reported
to</p>
<p>Richelieu. “I kissed his, and made myself his slave.” 93 He was given
an ele - gant apartment in the Palace of Sanssouci, just over the royal
suite. The King’s horses, coaches, coachmen, and cuisine were placed at
his com - mand. A dozen servants fussed around him; a hundred princes,
princesses, nobles, the Queen herself, paid court to him. He was
officially a chamber- lain to the King at twenty thousand francs a year,
but his chief chore was to correct the French of Frederick’s poetry and
speech. He was second only to the King at the suppers. A German visitor
thought their exchanges “a thousand times more interesting than any
book.” 94 “Never in any place in the world,” Voltaire later recalled,
“was there greater freedom of con - versation concerning the super
stitions of mankind.” 95</p>
<p>He was ecstatic. To d’Argental he wrote (September, 1750):</p>
<p>I find a port after thirty years of storms. I find the protection of
a</p>
<p>king, the conversation of a philosopher, the agreeable qualities of
an amiable man, all united in one who for sixteen years has wished to
con- sole me for my misfortunes, make me secure against my enemies. . .
. Here I am sure of a destiny forever tranquil. If one can be sure of
any- thing it is of the character of the King of Prussia . 98</p>
<p>He wrote to Mme. Denis asking her to come and live with him in his
para- dise. She wisely preferred Paris and younger gallants. She warned
him against staying long in Berlin. Friendship with a king (she wrote)
is always precarious; he changes his mind and his favorites; one must be
always on one’s guard not to cross the royal mood or will. Sooner or
later Voltaire would find himself a servant and a prisoner rather than a
friend. 97</p>
<p>The foolish philosopher sent the letter to Frederick, who, reluctant
to lose his prize, wrote to him in reply (August 23) :</p>
<p>I have seen the letter which your niece writes you from Paris.
The</p>
<p>affection which she has for you wins my esteem. If I were Mme. Denis
I should think as she does; but being what I am, I think otherwise.
I</p>
<p>should be in despair to be the cause of my enemy’s unhappiness; how,
then, could I wish the misfortune of a man whom I esteem, whom I</p>
<p>love, and who sacrifices to me his country and all that is dearest to
hu- manity? No, my dear Voltaire, if I could foresee that your
removal</p>
<p>hither would turn the least in the world to your disadvantage, I
should</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>be the first to dissuade you from it. I should prefer your happiness
to my extreme pleasure in possessing you. But you are a philosopher; I
am one also; what is then more natural, more simple, more according to
the order of things, than that philosophers made to live together,
united by the same studies, by the same tastes, and by a similar way of
thinking, should give one another that satisfaction? … I am firmly
persuaded</p>
<p>that you will be very happy here; that you will be regarded as the
fa- ther of letters and of people of taste; and that you will find in me
all the consolations which a man of your merit can expect from one who
esteems him. Good night. 98</p>
<p>It took the older philosopher only four months to ruin his paradise.
Vol- taire was a millionaire, but he could not with equanimity miss an
oppor- tunity to swell his hoard. The state bank of Saxony had issued
notes called Steuerscheine (revenue certificates), which had fallen to
half their original worth. In the Treaty of Dresden Frederick had
required that all such notes that had been bought by Prussians should be
redeemed, at maturity, at their face value in gold. Some wily Prussians
bought Steuerscheine at a low price in Holland and then had them
redeemed in full in Prussia. In May, 1748, in justice to Saxony,
Frederick forbade such importation. On November 23, 1750, Voltaire
summoned to him at Potsdam a Jewish banker, Abraham Hirsch. According to
Hirsch, Voltaire asked him to go to Dresden and buy for him 18,430 ecu
s’ worth of Steuerscheine at thirty -five per cent of their face value.
Hirsch claimed to have warned Voltaire that these bank notes could not
be legally brought into Prussia; Voltaire (said Hirsch) promised him
protection, and gave him letters of exchange on Paris and Leipzig. As
security for these sums Hirsch left with Voltaire some diamonds that had
been appraised at 18,430 ecus. After his agent’s departure (December 2)
Voltaire regretted the arrangement, and Hirsch, arrived in Dresden, de-
cided not to go through with the transaction; Voltaire stopped payment
on the letters of exchange, and the banker returned to Berlin. According
to Hirsch, Voltaire sought to bribe him to silence by buying three
thousand ecus’ worth of the diamonds. A dispute a rose over the
appraisal; Voltaire flew at Hirsch’s throat and knocked him down; 99 not
receiving further sat - isfaction, he had Hirsch arrested, and brought
the dispute to public trial (December 30). Hirsch exposed Voltaire’s
plan for buying Saxon bonds ; Voltaire denied it, saying he had sent
Hirsch to Dresden to buy furs. No- body believed him.</p>
<p>Frederick, learning of the mess, dispatched an angry letter from
Pots- dam to Voltaire at Berlin (February 24, 1751):</p>
<p>I was glad to receive you in my house; I esteemed your genius, your
talents and acquirements; and I had reason to think that a man of
your</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>463</p>
<p>age, wearied with fencing against authors and exposing himself to the
storm, came hither to take refuge as in a safe harbor.</p>
<p>But, on arriving, you exacted of me, in a rather singular manner, not
to take Freron to write news from Paris, and I had the weakness . . . to
grant you this, though it is not for you to decide what persons I</p>
<p>should take into my service. Baculard d’ Arnault 〔Baculard d’Arnaud,
a French poet at Frederick’s court〕 had given you offense, a generous
man would have pardoned him; a vindictive man hunts down those whom he
takes to hating. . . . Though to me d’ Arnault had done nothing, it was
on your account that he had to go. … You have had the most vil-</p>
<p>lainous affair in the world with a Jew. It has made a frightful
scandal all over town. And that Steuerschein business is so well known
in Saxony that they have made grievous complaints of it to me.</p>
<p>For my own part I have preserved peace in my house till your ar-</p>
<p>rival; and I warn you that if you have the passion of intriguing
and</p>
<p>caballing, you have applied to the wrong hand. I like peaceable, com-
posed people, who do not put into their conduct the passions of tragic
drama. In case you can resolve to live like a philosopher, I shall be
glad to see you; but if you abandon yourself to all the violences of
your</p>
<p>passions, and get into quarrels with all the world, you will do me no
good by coming hither, and you may as well stay in Berlin.</p>
<p>The trial court declared in favor of Voltaire. He sent humble
apologies to the King; Frederick granted him pardon, but advis ed him to
“have no more quarrels, neither with the Old Testament nor with the
New.” 100 Henceforth Voltaire was lodged not in Sanssouci but in a
pleasant rural lodge nearby called “the Marquisat.” The King sent him
assurances of re - newed esteem, but V oltaire’s foolishness did not
extend to trusting them. The royal poet sent him poems with requests to
polish the French; Voltaire labored over them to weariness, and offended
the author by making incisive alterations.</p>
<p>Voltaire now composed his poem Sur la Loi naturelle; it sought to
find God in nature, chiefly along the lines of Alexander Pope. Of far
greater import was Le Siecle de Louis XIV , which in these worrisome
months he brought to finished form, and published in Berlin (1751). He
was anxious to have it printed before some necessity should drive him
from Germany, for only under Frederick could it be safe from censorship.
“You know very well,” he wrote to Richelieu on August 31, “that there is
not one little cen - sor of books 〔in Paris〕 who would not have made a
merit and duty out of mutilating or suppressing my work.” 101 The sale
of the book was forbidden in France; booksellers in Holland and England
issued pirated editions, for which they paid Voltaire nothing; noting
this, we may better understand his love of money. He had to fight “rogue
booksellers” 102 as well as ec - clesiastics and governments.</p>
<p>4&lt;&gt;4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>The Age of Louis XIV was the most thoroughly and conscientiously</p>
<p>prepared of Voltaire’s works. He had planned it in 1732, begun it in
1734 put it aside in 1738, resumed it in 1750. For it he read two
hundred volumes and reams of unpublished memoirs, consulted scores of
survivors from le grand siecle, studied the original papers of
protagonists like Louvois and Colbert, secured from the Due de Noailles
the manuscripts left by Louis XIV, and found important documents,
hitherto unused, in the archives of the Louvre. 103 He weighed
conflicting evidence with discretion and care, and achieved a high
degree of accuracy. With Mme. du Chatelet he had tried to be a
scientist, and had failed; now he turned to writing history, and there
his success was a revolution.</p>
<p>Long ago, in a letter of January 18, 1739, he had expressed his aim:
“My chief object is not political and military history, it is the
history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization — in a word, of the
human mind.” And, still better, in a letter written to Thieriot in
1736:</p>
<p>When I asked for anecdotes on the age of Louis XIV it was less on</p>
<p>the King himself than on the arts that flourished in his reign. I
should prefer details about Racine and Boileau, Quinault, Lully,
Moliere, Le Brun, Bossuet, Poussin, Descartes, and others, rather than
about the battle of Steenkerke. Nothing but a name remains of those who
com- manded battalions and fleets; nothing results to the human race
from a hundred battles gained; but the great men of whom I have spoken
pre- pared pure and durable delights for generations unborn. A canal
that connects two seas, a picture by Poussin, a beautiful tragedy, a
discov- ered truth, are things a thousand times more precious than all
the annals of the court, all the narratives of war. You know that with
me great</p>
<p>men rank first, “heroes” last. I call great men all those who have ex
- celled in the useful and the agreeable. The ravagers of provinces are
mere heroes . 104</p>
<p>Possibly Voltaire would have promoted martial heroes from last place
if their victories had saved civilization from barbarism; but it was
natural that the philosopher who knew no weapon but words would enjoy
raising aloft the men of his own kind; and his name illustrates his
thesis by remain- ing, after two centuries, the most prominent in our
memory of his age. Originally he had proposed to give all the book to
cultural history; then Mme. du Chatelet suggested to him a “general
history” of the nations; con - sequently he added chapters on politics,
war, and the court to make the volume a homogeneous continuation of the
larger Essai sur Vhistoire gen- erale that was taking form under his
pen. This may be the reason why the cultural history is not integrated
into the rest of the volume: the first half of the book is devoted to
political and military history; then follow sec-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA 465</p>
<p>dons on manners (“characteristics and anecdotes”), government, com -
merce, science, literature, art, and religion.</p>
<p>The hunted scribe looked back with admiration to the reign under
which poets (if they behaved) were honored by the King; perhaps his
emphasis on the support of literature and art by Louis XIV was a flank
attack upon Louis XV’s comparative indifference to such patronage. Now
that the grandeur of the former age stood out in gilded retrospect, and
its despotism and dragonnades were shunted from memory, Voltaire
idealized the Sun King somewhat, and thrilled to the victories of French
generals — though he stigmatized the devastation of the Palatinate. But
criticism hides its head before this first modern attempt at integral
history. Perceptive contempo- raries realized that here was a new start
— history as the biography of civili- zation, history as transformed by
art and perspective into literature and philosophy. Within a year of its
publication the Earl of Chesterfield wrote to his son:</p>
<p>Voltaire has sent me from Berlin his Histone du siecle de Louis
XIV.</p>
<p>It came at a very proper time; Lord Bolingbroke had just taught
me</p>
<p>how history should be read; Voltaire shows me how it should be</p>
<p>written. … It is the history of the human understanding, written
by</p>
<p>a man of genius for the use of intelligent men. … Free from reli-</p>
<p>gious, philosophical, political, and national prejudices beyond any
his- torian I have ever met with, he relates all those matters as truly
and as impartially as certain regards, which must always be observed,
will</p>
<p>allow him . 105</p>
<p>Amid his literary labor s Voltaire fretted over his insecurity at
Frederick’s court. One day in August, 1751, La Mettrie, the jolly
materialist who often read to the King, reported to Voltaire their
host’s remark: “I need him 〔Voltaire〕 another year at most 〔as
polisher of the royal French〕; one squeezes the orange, and throws away
the peel.” 106 Some have doubted the authenticity of the remark; it was
not like Frederick to be so confidential, and it was not impossible for
La Mettrie to wish Voltaire off the scene. “I have done all that I could
not to believe La Mettrie,” Voltaire wrote to Mme. Denis on September 2;
“but still, I don’t know.” And to her on Oc - tober 29: “I keep dreaming
about that orange peel. . . . He who was fall - ing from a bell tower
and, finding hims elf at ease in the air, said, ‘Good, provided this
lasts,’ resembles me quite.” 107</p>
<p>There was another Frenchman in Germany who entered into the com- edy.
Of two Frenchmen in the same court, said Frederick, one must per- ish.
108 Maupertuis, head of the Berlin Academy, was next in honor to Vol-
taire alone among the guests at Sanssouci; each was irked by that prox-
imity; and perhaps Voltaire had not forgotten that Mme. du Chatelet
had</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>been fond of Maupertuis. In April, 1751, Voltaire gave a dinner
party; Maupertuis was invited and came. “Your book Sur le Bonheur has
given me great pleasure,” said Voltaire, “a few obscurities excepted, of
which we will talk together some evening.” “Obscurities? There may be
such for you, monsieur,” scowled Maupertuis. Voltaire laid a hand on the
scientist’s shoulder. “Monsieur le President,” he said, “I esteem you;
you are brave, you want war. We will have it, but meanwhile let us eat
the King’s roast meat.” 109 “Maupertuis,” he wrote to d’Argental (May
4), “is not of very engaging ways. He takes my dimensions harshly with
his quadrant; it is said that there enters something of envy into his
data. … A somewhat surly gentleman, not too sociable.” And on July 24,
1752, to niece Denis: “Maupertuis has discreetly set the rumor going
that I found the King’s Works very bad; that I said to someone, on
verses of the King coming in, ‘Will he never tire, then, of sending me
his dirty linen to wash?’” uo It is not certain that Maupertuis had
conveyed this rumor to Frederick; Voltaire thought it certain, and
resolved on war.</p>
<p>One of Maupertuis’ contributions to science was the “princ iple of
least action”— that all effects in the world of motion tend to be
achieved by the least force sufficient for the result. Samuel Koenig,
who owed his member- ship in the Berlin Academy to Maupertuis, came upon
what purported to be a copy of an unpublished letter of Leibniz, in
which this principle</p>
<p>seemed to be anticipated. He wrote an article about his discovery,
but be- fore publishing it he submitted it to Maupertuis, offering to
suppress it if the president objected. Maupertuis, perhaps after too
hurried a perusal, consented to the publication. Koenig had the article
printed in the</p>
<p>March, 1751, issue of the Leipzig Acta eruditorum. It caused a stir.
Mau- pertuis asked Koenig to submit Leibniz’ letter to the Academy;
Koenig replied that he had seen only a copy of it among the papers of
his friend Henzi, who had been hanged in 1749; he had made a copy of
this copy, and now sent it to Maupertuis, who again demanded the
original. Koenig confessed that this could not now be found, since Hen
zi’s papers had been scattered after his death. Maupertuis submitted the
matter to the Academy (October 7, 1751); the secretary sent to Koenig a
peremptory order to produce the original. He could not. On April 13,
1752, the Academy pro- nounced the supposed letter of Leibniz a forgery.
Maupertuis did not at- tend this session, being ill with consumptive
spitting of blood. 111 Koenig sent in his resignation from the Academy,
and issued an Appeal to the Public (September, 1752).</p>
<p>Koenig had once spent two years at Cirey as the guest of Voltaire and
Mme. du Chatelet. Voltaire decided to strike a blow for his former
friend at a present enemy. In the quarterly review Bibliotheque
raisonnee for</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>September 18 there appeared a “Reponse d’un academicien de Berlin a
un academicien de Paris,” restating the case for Koenig, and concluding
that the Sieur Maupertuis has been convicted, in the face of Scientific
Eu- rope, not only of plagiarism and blunder, but of having abused his
place to suppress free discussion, and to persecute an honest man. . . .
Sev- eral members of our Academy have protested against so crying a pro-
cedure, and would leave the Academy, were it not for fear of displeas-
ing the King . 112</p>
<p>The article was unsigned, but Frederick knew Voltaire’s feline touch.
In - stead of hurling a royal thunderbolt, he wrote a reply in which the
“Re - ponse” was described as “malicious, cowardly, and infamous,” and
its au - thor was branded “a shameless impostor,” an “ugly brigand,” a
“concocter</p>
<p>Voltaire’s pride was piqued. He could never let an enemy have the
last word, and perhaps he had made up his mind to break with the King.
“I have no scepter,” he wrote to Mme. Denis (October 18, 1752), “but I
have a pen.” He t ook full advantage of the fact that Maupertuis had
just published (Dresden, 1752) a series of Lettres in which it was
suggested that a hole be bored into the earth, if possible to the
center, in order to study its composition; that one of the Pyramids of
Egypt be blown up, to discover the secrets of their purpose and design;
that a city be built where only Latin would be spoken, so that students
might go there for a year or two and learn that language as they had
learned their own; that a doctor be paid only after curing the patient;
that an adequate dose of opium might enable a man to foresee the future;
and that proper care of the body might enable us to prolong life
indefinitely. 114 Voltaire seized upon these Lettres as easy game,
carefully ignoring any item of good sense in them and any hints of
humor, and tossed the rest joyously upon the horns of his wit. So, in
November, 1752, he composed his famous Diatribe of Dr. Akakia, Phy-
sician and Ordinary to the Pope.</p>
<p>Diatribe then meant a diss ertation; akakia is Greek for “guileless
sim - plicity.” The supposed physician began in apparent innocence by
doubt - ing that so great a man as the president of the Berlin Academy
had written so absurd a book. After all, “nothing is more common in the
p resent age than for young and ignorant authors to usher into the
world, under well- known names, works unworthy of the supposed writers.”
These Lettres</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>sympathetic chord in Voltaire’s aching breast, but: “Does a c lient
deprive a lawyer of his just fee because he has lost his cause? A
physician promises his assistance, not a cure. He does all that lies in
his power, and is paid ac- cordingly.” How would a member of the Academy
like it if a certain</p>
<p>number of ducats were to be subtracted from his annual salary for
every error he has made, for every absurdity that he has uttered, during
the year? And the doctor proceeded to detail what Voltaire considered to
be errors or absurdities in Maupertuis’ works. 115</p>
<p>It was not so brilliant a satire as commonly supposed; much of it is
repe- titious, and some of the fault-finding is trivial and ungenerous;
we conceal our venom more politely in these days. But Voltaire was so
pleased with his performance that he could not resist the added delight
of seeing it in print. He sent a manuscript of it to a printer in The
Hague. Meanwhile he showed another manuscript to the King. Frederick,
who privately agreed that Maupertuis was sometimes insufferably
conceited, enjoyed the skit (or so we are told), but forbade Voltaire to
publish it; obviously, the dignity and prestige of the Berlin Academy
were involved. Voltaire allowed him to keep the manuscript, but the
satire was nevertheless published in Hol- land. Soon thirty thousand
copies were flying about Paris, Brussels, The Hague, Berlin. One reached
Frederick. He expressed his anger in such terms that Voltaire fled to a
private lodging in the capital. On December 24, 1752, he saw from his
window the public burning of the Diatribe by the official executioner of
the state. On January 1, 1753, he remitted to Frederick his gold key as
a chamberlain, and his Cross of Merit.</p>
<p>Now he was really ill. Erysipelas burned his brow, dysentery tortured
his bowels, fever consumed him. He took to his bed on February 2 and
stayed there for two weeks, having, said a visitor, “all the appearance
of a skeleton.” 116 Frederick, relenting, sent his own physician to
attend the poet. When he improved, Voltaire wrote to the King asking
permission to visit Plombieres, whose waters might heal his erysipelas.
Frederick bade his secretary reply (March 16) “that he can leave this
service whenever he wishes; that he has no need to employ the pretext of
the waters of Plom- bieres; but that he will have the goodness, before
setting out, to return to me . . . the volume of poems that I confided
to him.” 117 On the eighteenth the King invited Voltaire to reoccupy his
old apartment in Sanssouci. Vol- taire came, remained eight days, and
apparently made his peace with the King — but kept the royal poems. On
March 26 he bade Frederick au revoir, both pretending that the
separation was to be temporary. “Take care of your health above all,”
said the King, “and don’t forget that I expect to see you again after
the waters. . . . Bon voyage!” 118 They never saw each other again.</p>
<p>So ended this historic friendship, but the ridiculous enmities went
on.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA</p>
<p>469</p>
<p>Voltaire, with secretary and baggage, rolled on in his own coach to
safety in Saxon Leipzig. There, pleading weakness, he tarried three
weeks, adding to the Diatribe. On April 6 he received a letter from
Maupertuis:</p>
<p>The gazettes say you are detained sick at Leipzig; private
informa-</p>
<p>tion assures me that you are stopping there only to have new
libels</p>
<p>printed. … I have never done anything against you, never written</p>
<p>anything, never said anything. I have ever found it unworthy of me to
reply one word to the impertinences which you have hitherto spread
abroad . . . But if it is true that your intention is to attack me
again,</p>
<p>and to attack me by personalities, … I declare to you that . . .
my</p>
<p>health is sufficiently good to find you wherever you may be, and
to</p>
<p>wreak upon you vengeance the most complete. 119</p>
<p>Voltaire nevertheless printed the embellished Diatribe, and with it
Mauper- tuis’ letter. The pamphlet, now swollen to fifty pages, beca me
the gossip of palaces and courts in Germany and France. Wilhelmine wrote
from Bayreuth to Frederick (April 24, 1753) confessing that she had not
been able to keep from laughing over the piece. Maupertuis did not carry
out his threat, nor did he, as some supposed, die of unimplemented rage
and grief; he survived Dr. Akakia by six years, and died at Basel in
1759 of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>On April 19 Voltaire moved on to Gotha. There he put up at the public
inn, but the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Gotha soon persuaded him to come
and stay in their palace. As the little court went in for culture, the
Duchess gathered notables and literati, and Voltaire read to them from
his works, even from the rollicking La Pucelle. Then on to
Frankfurt-am-Main,</p>
<p>where Nemesis overtook him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Voltaire continued the war against Maupertuis, Frederick
wondered whether the irresponsible poet might give to the world the
poems that Frederick had composed, and of which a privately printed copy
was still in Voltaire’s possession — poems some risque, some ridiculing
Christian- ity, some speaking with more wit than respect of living
sovereigns, and therefore liable to alienate useful powers. He sent to
Freytag, Prussian resident at Frankfurt, orders to detain Voltaire until
the impish skeleton should surrender the royal poems and various
decorations given him by the King during the honeymoon. Frankfurt was a
“free city,” but so dependent upon Frederick’s good will that it did not
dare interfere with these orders; moreover, Voltaire was still
technically in the service of, and on a leave of absence from, the
Prussian King. On June 1 Freytag went to the Golden Lion, where Voltaire
had arrived the night before, and politely asked for the insignia and
the poetry. Voltaire allowed the resident to examine his luggage and
take the royal decorations; but as for the royal poems, they</p>
<p>470</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>were probably in a box that had been forwarded to Hamburg. Freytag
ordered him kept under watch until the box could be brought from Ham-
burg. On June 9 the fuming philosopher was consoled by the arrival of
Mme. Denis, who helped him express his rage. She was appalled by his
emaciation. “I knew that man 〔Frederick〕 would be the death of you!”
On June 18 the box arrived; the volume of poetry was found and
surrendered; but on the same day a new directive from Potsdam ordered
Freytag to maintain the status quo till further orders came. Voltaire,
his patience quite at an end, tried to escape; on June 20, leaving his
baggage with his niece, he and his secretary secretly fled from
Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Before they could reach the limits of the municipal jurisdiction
they</p>
<p>were overtaken by Freytag, who brought them to the city and lodged
them as prisoners in the Goat Inn, for (according to Freytag) “the
landlord of the Golden Lion was unwilling to have Voltaire any longer in
his house, on account of his incredible parsimony.” 120 All of
Voltaire’s money was now taken from him by his captors; also his watch,
some jewels that he wore, and his snuffbox — which was soon restored to
him on his plea that it was indispensable to his life. On June 21 a
letter arrived from Frederick order- ing Voltaire’s release, but Freytag
thought that strict duty required him to send the King notice that
Voltaire had tried to escape; should he still be allowed to go? On July
5 Frederick answered yes; after thirty-five days of detention Voltaire
was freed. On July 7 he left Frankfurt for Mainz. Mme. Denis returned to
Paris, hoping to secure permission for Voltaire to enter France.</p>
<p>The news of his arrest had spread, and now, wherever he went, he was
feted and acclaimed, for Frederick was not popular except with Wilhel-
mine, and Voltaire was still, with all his deviltry, the greatest living
poet, dramatist, and historian. After three weeks in Mainz he moved on,
with the suite of a prince, to Mannheim and Strasbourg (August 1 5 to
October</p>
<p>2), where he feasted his soul with the thought that he was on French
soil. Then on to Colmar (October 2), where Wilhelmine, en route to Mont-
pellier, visited and comforted him “with bounties.” His strength revived
enough to inspire some gallant letters to Mme. Denis, who had complained
of a swelling in her thighs:</p>
<p>Eh, mon Dieu, my dear child, what are your legs and mine trying
to</p>
<p>say? If they were together they would be well 〔elles se porter
aient</p>
<p>bien 〕. . . . Your thighs were not made to suffer. These lovely
thighs</p>
<p>so soon to be kissed are now shamefully treated 〔Queste belle c
ossie tantot bacciate sono oggi indignamente trattate 〕. 121</p>
<p>In a humbler mood he wrote to Mme. de Pompadour invoking her influ-
ence with Louis XV to allow him to return to Paris. But meanwhile a
pirate</p>
<p>CHAP, XIIl) FREDERICK AND MARIA THERESA 47 1</p>
<p>printer in The Hague published a garbled Abrege de Thistoire
generate, an abridgment of Voltaire’s unfinished Essai sur I’histoire
generate, or Essai sur les moeurs; it contained some sharp
animadversions on Christianity; it sold rapidly in Paris; Louis XV
informed Pompadour, “I do not wish Vol - taire to come to Paris.” 122
The Jesuits in Colmar called for his expulsion from that city. He tried
to appease his ecclesiastical enemies by taking the Sacrament at Easter;
the sole result was that his friends joined with the Jesuits in calling
him a hypocrite. “Behold Voltaire, who knows not where</p>
<p>The homeless philosopher desperately thought of leaving Europe and
settling in Philadelphia; he admired the spirit of Penn and the work of
Franklin, who had just united lightning and electricity; “if the sea did
not make me unsupportably sick, it is among the Quakers of Pennsylvania
that I would finish the remainder of my life.” 124 On June 8, 1754, he
left Col - mar, and found asylum in the Benedictine Abbey of Senones in
Lorraine. There the learned Dom A justin Calmet was abbot and the
library had twelve thousand volumes; for three weeks, amid the monks,
Voltaire found peace. On July 2 he moved on to Plombieres, and at last
drank its waters. Mme. Denis joined him there, and henceforth remained
the mistress at least of his household. He resumed his wandering, went
back to Colmar, found it uncomfortable, passed on to Dijon for a night,
then to Lyons for a month (November 1 1 to December 10). For a week he
was the guest of his old friend and debtor the Due de Richelieu; then,
perhaps fearing to compro- mise him, he moved to the Palais-Royal Hotel.
He attended the Academy of Lyons, and received all its honors. Some of
his plays were produced in the local theater, and his spirit was
heartened by the applause. He thought of settling in Lyons, but
Archbishop Tencin objected, 125 and Voltaire de- parted. He knew that at
any moment he might be arrested if he remained in France.</p>
<p>Late in 1754, or early in 1755, he crossed over the Jura Mountains
into Switzerland.</p>
