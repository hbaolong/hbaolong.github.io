<h4 id="chapter-xxviii-the-makers-of-japan">CHAPTER XXVIII The Makers of
Japan</h4>
<p>T HE history of Japan is an unfinished drama in which three acts have
been played. The first — barring the primitive and legendary centuries —
is classical Buddhist Japan (522-1603 a.d.), suddenly civilized by China
and Korea, refined and softened by religion, and creating the historic
masterpieces of Japanese literature and art. The second is the feudal
and peaceful Japan of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603-1868), isolated and
self- contained, seeking no alien territory and no external trade,
content with agriculture and wedded to art and philosophy. The third act
is modem Japan, opened up in 1853 by an American fleet, forced by
conditions within and without into trade and industry, seeking foreign
materials and markets, fighting wars of irrepressible expansion,
imitating the im- perialistic ardor and methods of the West, and
threatening both the ascendancy of the white race and the peace of the
world. By every his- torical precedent the next act will be war.</p>
<p>The Japanese have studied our civilization carefully, in order to
absorb its values and surpass it. Perhaps we should be wise to study
their civili- zation as patiently as they have studied ours, so that
when the crisis comes that must issue either in war or understanding, we
may be capable of understanding.</p>
<p>I. THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS</p>
<p>How Japan was created — The rdle of earthquakes</p>
<p>In the beginning, says the oldest of Japanese histories , 1 were the
gods. Male and female they were bom, and died, until at last two of
them, Izanagi and Izanami, brother and sister, were commanded by the
elder deities to create Japan. So they stood on the floating bridge of
heaven, thrust down into the ocean a jeweled spear, and held it aloft in
the sky. The drops that fell from the spear became the Sacred Islands.
By watch- ing the tadpoles in the water the gods learned the secret of
copulation; Izanagi and Izanami mated, and gave birth to the Japanese
race. From Izanagi’s left eye was bom Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun, and
from</p>
<p>830 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>her grandson Ninigi sprang in divine and unbroken lineage all the em-
perors of Dai Nippon. From that day until this there has been but one
imperial dynasty in Japan.*</p>
<p>There were 4,223 drops from the jeweled spear, for there are that</p>
<p>number of islands in the archipelago called Japan, t Six hundred of
them are inhabited, but only five are of any considerable size. The
largest — Hondo or Honshu — is 1,130 miles long, averages some 73 miles
in width, and contains in its 81,000 square miles half the area of the
islands. Their situation, like their recent history, resembles that of
England: the sur- rounding seas have protected them from conquest, while
their 13,000 miles of seacoast have made them a seafaring people,
destined by geo- graphical encouragement and commercial necessity to a
widespread mas- tery of the seas. Warm winds and currents from the south
mingle with the cool air of the mountain-tops to give Japan an English
climate, rich in rain and cloudy days, 4 nourishing to short but
rapid-running rivers, and propitious to vegetation and scenery. Here,
outside the cities and the slums, half the land is an Eden in
blossom-time; and the mountains are no tumbled heaps of rock and dirt,
but artistic forms designed, like Fuji, in almost perfect lines-J</p>
<p>Doubtless these isles were born of earthquakes rather than from drip-
ping spears. 8 No other land — except, perhaps, South America — has suf-
fered so bitterly from convulsions of the soil. In the year 599 the
earth shook and swallowed villages in its laughter; meteors fell and
comets flashed, and snow whitened the streets in mid-July; drought and
famine followed, and millions of Japanese died. In 1703 an earthquake
killed 32,000 in Tokyo alone. In 1885 the capital was wrecked again;
great clefts opened in the earth, and engulfed thousands; the dead were
carried away in cartloads and buried en masse. In 1923 earthquake, tidal
wave and fire took 100,000 lives in Tokyo, and 37,000 in Yokahama and
near-</p>

<li>j£ t his account be questioned sis improbable, the objection has
long since been answered by the most influential of Japanese critics,
Moto- ori: “The very inconsistency is the proof of the authenticity of
the record; for who would have gone out of his way to invent a story
apparently so ridiculous and incredible?” 3</li>
</ul>
<p>The name Japan is probably a corruption of the Malay word for the
islands-/flp&lt;rag or Japun; this is a rendering of the Japanese term
Nippon , which in turn is a corrup- tion of the Chinese name for “the
place the sun comes from” -Jih-pen. The Japanese usually prefix to
Nippon the adjective Dai , meaning Great.</p>
<p>Fuji-san (less classically Fuji-yama), idol of artists and priests,
approximates to a gently sloping cone. Many thousands of pilgrims ascend
its 12,365 feet in any year. Fuji (Ainu for “fire”) erupted last in
1707. 5</p>

<p>by; Kamakura, so kind to Buddha, was almost totally destroyed,’ while
the benign colossus of the Hindu saint survived shaken but unperturbed
amid the ruins, as if to illustrate the chief lesson of history — that
the gods can be silent in many languages. The people were for a moment
puzzled by this abundance of disaster in a land divinely created and
ruled; at last they explained the agitations as due to a large
subterranean fish, which wriggled when its slumber was disturbed. 8 They
do not seem to have thought of abandoning this adventurous habitat; on
the day after the last great quake the school-children used bits of
broken plaster for pencils, and the tiles of their shattered homes for
slates.“ The nation bore patiently these lashings of circumstance, and
emerged from repeated ruin undiscourageably industrious, and ominously
brave.</p>

<li>PRIMITIVE JAPAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Racial components — Early civilization — Religion — “Shinto”—</p>
<p>Buddhism — The beginnings of art — The “ Great Reform”</p>
<p>Japanese origins, like all others, are lost in the cosmic nebula of
theory. Three elements appear to be mingled in the race: a primitive
white strain through the “Ainus” who seem to have entered Japan from the
region of the Amur River in neolithic times; a yellow, Mongol strain
coming from or through Korea about the seventh century before Christ;
and a brown- black, Malay and Indonesian strain filtering in from the
islands of the south. Here, as elsewhere, a mingling of diverse stocks
preceded by many hundreds of years the establishment of a new racial
type speaking with a new voice and creating a new civilization. That the
mixture is not yet complete may be seen in the contrast between the
tall, slim, long-headed aristocrat and the short, stout, broad-headed
common man.</p>
<p>Chinese annals of the fourth century describe the Japanese as
“dwarfs,” and add that “they have neither oxen nor wild beasts; they
tattoo their faces in patterns varying with their rank; they wear
garments woven in one piece; they have spears, bows and arrows tipped
with stone or iron. They wear no shoes, are law-abiding and polygamous,
addicted to strong drink and long-lived…. The women smear their bodies
with pink and scarlet” paint.” “There is no theft,” these records state,
“and litigation is infrequent”;” civilization had hardly begun. Lafcadio
Hearn, with</p>
<p>uxorious clairvoyance, painted this early age as an Eden unsullied
with exploitation or poverty; and Fenollosa pictured the peasantry as
composed</p>
<p>832 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>of independent soldier-gentlemen. 13 Handicrafts came over from Korea
in the third century a.d., and were soon organized into guilds. 14
Beneath these free artisans was a considerable slave class, recruited
from prisons and battlefields. 13 Social organization was partly feudal,
partly tribal; some peasants tilled the soil as vassals of landed
barons, and each clan had its well-nigh sovereign head. 10 Government
was primitively loose and weak.</p>
<p>Animism and totemism, ancestor worship and sex worship 17 satisfied
the religious needs of the early Japanese. Spirits were everywhere — in
the planets and stars of the sky, in the plants and insects of the
field, in trees and beasts and men. 18 Deities innumerable hovered over
the home and its in- mates, and danced in the flame and glow of the
lamp. 18 Divination was prac- tised by burning the bones of a deer or
the shell of a tortoise, and studying with expert aid the marks and
lines produced by the fire; by this means, say the ancient Chinese
chronicles, “they ascertain good and bad luck, and whether or not to
undertake journeys and voyages.” 20 The dead were feared and worshiped,
for their ill will might generate much mischief in the world; to placate
them precious objects were placed in their graves — for ex- ample, a
sword in the case of a man, a mirror in the case of a woman; and prayers
and delicacies were offered before their ancestral tablets every day. 21
Human sacrifices were resorted to now and then to stop excessive rain or
to ensure the stability of a building or a wall; and the retainers of a
dead lord were occasionally buried with him to defend him in his
epilogue. 22</p>
<p>Out of ancestor worship came the oldest living religion of Japan.
Shinto , the Way of the Gods, took three forms: the domestic cult of
family an- cestors, the communal cult of clan ancestors, and the state
cult of the im- perial ancestors and the founding gods. The divine
progenitor of the im- perial line was addressed with humble petitions,
seven times a year, by the emperor or his representatives; and special
prayers were offered up to him when the nation was embarking upon some
particularly holy cause, like the taking of Shantung (1914). 28 Shinto
required no creed, no elaborate ritual, no moral code; it had no special
priesthood, and no consoling doctrine of immortality and heaven; all
that it asked of its devotees was an occasional pilgrimage, and pious
reverence for one’s ancestors, the emperor, and the</p>
<p>In 522 Buddhism, which had entered China five hundred years before,
passed over from the continent, and began a rapid conquest of Japan. Two
elements met to give it victory: the religious needs of the people, and
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE MAKERS OF JAPAN 833</p>
<p>political needs of the state. For it was not Buddha’s Buddhism that
came, agnostic, pessimistic and puritan, dreaming of blissful
extinction; it was the Mahay ana Buddhism of gentle gods like Amida and
Kwannon, of cheerful ceremonial, saving Bodhisattwas, and personal
immortality. Better still, it in- culcated, with irresistible grace, all
those virtues of piety, peacefulness and obedience which make a people
amenable to government; it gave to the oppressed such hopes and
consolations as might reconcile them to content with their simple lot;
it redeemed the prose and routine of a laborious life with the poetry of
myth and prayer and the drama of colorful festival; and it offered to
the people that unity of feeling and belief which statesmen have always
welcomed as a source of social order and a pillar of national
strength.</p>
<p>We do not know whether it was statesmanship or piety that brought
victory to Buddhism in Japan. When, in 586 a.d., the Emperor Yomei died,
the succession was contested in arms by two rival families, both of them
politically devoted to the new creed. Prince Shotoku Taishi, who had
been born, we are told, with a holy relic clasped in his infant hand,
led the Bud- dhist faction to victory, established the Empress Suiko on
the throne, and for twenty-nine years (592-621) ruled the Sacred Islands
as Prince Imperial and Regent. He lavished funds upon Buddhist temples,
encouraged and supported the Buddhist clergy, promulgated the Buddhist
ethic in national decrees, and became in general the Ashoka of Japanese
Buddhism. He patronized the arts and sciences, imported artists and
artisans from Korea and China, wrote history, painted pictures, and
supervised the building of the Horiuji Temple, the oldest extant
masterpiece in the art history of Japan.</p>
<p>Despite the work of this versatile civilizer, and all the virtues
inculcated or preached by Buddhism, another violent crisis came to Japan
within a genera- tion after Shotoku’s death. An ambitious aristocrat,
Kamatari, arranged with Prince Naka a palace revolution that marked so
definite a change in the political history of Nippon that native
historians refer to it enthusiastically as the “Great Reform” (645). The
heir -apparent was assassinated, a senile pup- pet was placed upon the
throne, and Kamatari as chief minister, through Prince Naka as
heir-apparent and then as Emperor Tenchi, reconstructed the Japanese
government into an autocratic imperial power. The sovereign was elevated
from the leadership of the principal clan to paramount authority over
every official in Japan; all governors were to be appointed by him, all
taxes paid directly to him, all the land of the realm was declared his.
Japan graduated rapidly from a loose association of clans and
semi-feudal chieftains into a closely-knit monarchical state.</p>

<p>HI. THE IMPERIAL AGE</p>
<p>The emperors — The aristocracy — The influence of China — The</p>
<p>Golden Age of Kyoto — Decadence</p>
<p>From that time onward the emperor enjoyed impressive titles. Some-
times he was called Tenshi, or “Son of Heaven”; usually Tenno, or</p>
<p>“Heavenly King”; rarely Mikado, or “August Gateway.” He had the</p>
<p>distinction of receiving a new appellation after his death, and of
being known in history by an individual name quite different from that
which he bore during his life. To ensure the continuity of the imperial
line, the emperor was allowed to have as many wives or consorts as he
desired; and the succession went not necessarily to his first son, but
to any of his progeny who seemed to him, or to the Warwicks of the time,
most likely to prove strongest, or weakest, on the throne. In the early
days of the Kyoto period the emperors inclined to piety; some of them
abdi- cated to become Buddhist monks, and one of them forbade fishing as
an insult to Buddha. 25 Yozei was a troublesome exception who
illustrated the perils of active monarchy: he made people climb trees,
and then shot them down with bow and arrow; he seized maidens in the
street, tied them up with lute strings, and cast them into ponds; it
pleased His Majesty to ride through the capital and to belabor the
citizens with his whip; at last his subjects deposed him in an outbreak
of political impiety rare in the history of Japan. 28 In 794 the
headquarters of the government were removed from Nara to Nagaoka, and
shortly thereafter to Kyoto (“Capital of Peace”); this remained the
capital duri ng those four centuries (794-</p>

<li>which most historians agree in calling the Golden Age of Japan. By
1190 Kyoto had a population of half a million, more than any Eu- ropean
city of the time except Constantinople and Cordova. 27 One part of the
town was given over to the cottages and hovels of the populace, which
seems to have lived cheerfully in its humble poverty; another part,
discreetly secluded, contained the gardens and palaces of the
aristocracy and the Imperial Family. The people of the court were
appropriately called “Dwellers above the Clouds.” 28 For here as
elsewhere the progress of civilization and technology had brought an
increase in social distinctions; the rough equality of pioneer days had
given way to the inequality that comes inevitably when increasing wealth
is distributed among men ac cording to their diverse capacity,
character, and privilege. Great families</li>

<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE MAKERS OF JAPAN 835</p>
<p>arose like the Fujiwara, the Taira, the Minamoto and the Sugawara,
who made and unmade emperors, and fought with one another in the lusty
manner of the Italian Renaissance. Sugawara Michizane endeared him- self
to Japan by his patronage of literature, and is now worshiped as the God
of Letters, in whose honor a school holiday is declared on the twenty-
fifth day of every month; and the young Shogun Minamoto Sanetomo dis-
tinguished himself by composing on the morning before his assassination
this simple stanza, in the chastest Japanese style:</p>
<p>If I should come no more,</p>
<p>Plum-tree beside my door,</p>
<p>Forget not thou the spring,</p>
<p>Faithfully blossoming.”</p>
<p>Under the enlightened Daigo (898-930), greatest of the emperors set
up by the Fujiwara clan, Japan continued to absorb, and began to rival,
the culture and luxury of China, then flourishing at its height under
the T’ang. Having taken their religion from the Middle Kingdom, the Japa
- nese proceeded to take from the same source their dress and their
sports, their cooking and their writing, their poetry and their
administrative methods, their music and their arts, their gardens and
their architecture; even their handsome capitals, Nara and Kyoto, were
laid out in imitation of Ch’ang -an. 30 Japan imported Chinese culture a
thousand years ago as it imported Europe and America in our own day:
first with haste, then with discrimination; jealously maintaining its
own spirit and character, zealously adapting the new ways to ancient and
native ends.</p>
<p>Stimulated by its great neighbor, and protected by orderly and con-
tinuous government, Japan now entered that Engi period (901-922) which
is accounted the acme of the Golden Age.* Wealth accumulated, and was
centered in a fashionable life of luxury, refinement and culture hardly
equaled again until the courts of the Medici and the salons of the
French Enlightenment. Kyoto became the Paris and Versailles of France,
elegant in poetry and dress, practised in manners and arts, and setting
for all the nation the standards of learning and taste. Every appetite
was full</p>
<p>“This period named ‘Engi,’” says the enthusiastic Fenollosa, “must
doubtless be reckoned the high- water mark of Japanese civilization, as
Ming Huang’s had been that of China. Never again would either China or
Japan be quite so rich, splendid, and full of free genius…. In general
culture and luxurious refinement of a life which equally ministered to
mind and body, not only not in Japan, but perhaps not in the world was
there ever again anything quite so exquisite.” 81</p>
<p>836 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>and free; the cuisine invented novelties for the palate and heaped up
feasts for gourmands and gourmets ; and fornication or adultery was
winked at as a very venial sin. 88 Silks of fine texture clothed every
lord and lady, and harmonies of color wavered on every sleeve. Music and
the dance adorned the life of temple and court, and graced aristocratic
homes attractively landscaped without, and luxuriously finished with in-
teriors of bronze or pearl, ivory or gold, or wood most delicately
carved. 08 Literature flourished, and morals decayed.</p>
<p>Such epochs of glittering refinement tend to be brief, for they
rest</p>
<p>insecurely upon concentrated wealth that may at any moment be de-
stroyed by the fluctuations of trade, the impatience of the exploited,
or the fortunes of war. The extravagance of the court finally ruined the
solvency of the state; the exaltation of culture above ability filled
admin- istrative posts with incompetent poetasters, under whose scented
noses corruption multiplied unnoticed; at last offices were sold to the
highest bidder. 8 * Crime rose among the poor as luxury mounted among
the rich; brigands and pirates infested the roads and the seas, and
preyed impar- tially upon the people and the emperor; tax-gatherers were
robbed as they brought their revenues to the court. Gangs of bandits
were organized in the provinces, and even in the capital itself; for a
time Japan’s most notorious criminal, like ours, lived in open splendor,
too powerful to be arrested or annoyed. 88 The neglect of martial habits
and virtues, or military or- ganization and defense, left the government
exposed to assault from any ruthless buccaneer. The great families
raised their own armies, and began an epoch of civil war in which they
contended chaotically for the right to name the emperor. The emperor
himself was every day more helpless, while the heads of the clans became
again almost independent lords. Once more history moved in its ancient
oscillation between a powerful central government and a feudal
decentralized regime.</p>

<p>Tempted by this situation, a class of military dictators arose, who

recog- nized the emperor merely as the divine fagade of Japan, to be
maintained</p>

<p>at a minimum of expense. The peasants, no longer protected from
bandits by imperial armies or police, paid taxes to the shoguns, or
generals, instead of to the emperor, for only the shoguns were able to
safeguard them from robbery.” The feudal system triumphed in Japan for
the same reason that it had triumphed in Europe: local sources of
authority grew in power as a central and distant government failed to
maintain security and order. About the year 1192 a member of the
Minamoto clan, Yoritomo, gath- ered about him an army of soldiers and
vassals, and established an inde- pendent authority which, from its
seat, acquired the name of the “Kama - kura Bakufu.” The very word
bakufu meant a military office, and indi - cated bluntly the nature of
the new regime. The great Yoritomo died suddenly in 1198,* and was
succeeded by his weakling sons; for, says a Japanese proverb, “the great
man has no seed.”” A rival family set up in 1199 the “Hojo Regency,”
which for 134 years ruled the shoguns</p>
<p>who ruled the emperors. Kublai Khan took advantage of this
trinitarian government to attempt the conquest of Japan, for clever
Koreans, fearful of it, had described it to him as desirably rich.
Kublai ordered from his ship-builders so vast a fleet that Chinese poets
represented the hills as mourning for their de nuded forests.” The
Japanese, in heroic retrospect, reckoned the vessels at 70,000, but less
patriotic historians are content with 3,500 ships and 100,000 men. This
gigantic armada appeared off the coast of Japan late in the year 1291.
The brave islanders sailed out to meet it in an improvised and
comparatively tiny fleet; but, as in the case of a smaller but more
famous Armada, t a “Great Wind,” renowned in thankful memory, arose,
smashed the ships of the mighty Khan upon the rocks, drowned 70,000 of
his sailors, and saved the others for a life of slavery in Japan.</p>
<p>The turn of the Hojos came in 1333. For they, too, had been poisoned
by power, and hereditary rule had passed in time from scoundrels and
geniuses to cowards and fools. Takatoki, last of the line, had a passion
for dogs; he accepted them in lieu of taxes, and collected from four to
five thousand of them; he kept them in kennels with gold and silver
decorations, fed them on fish and fowl, and had them carried in palan- *
Both rider and horse, we are told, were thrown into a panic by seeing
the ghost of the brother whom Yoritomo had murdered; the horse stumbled,
the rider fell, and Yoritomo died some months later, at the age of
fifty-three. 87 The story is vouched for by his enemies.</p>
<p>fThe Spanish Armada of 1588, on its arrival in the English Channel,
had some 120 ships, with 24,000 men. 88 *</p>

<p>quins to take the air. The contemporary emperor, Go Daigo, saw in the
degeneration of his keepers an opportunity to reassert the imperial
power. The Minamoto and Ashikaga clans rallied to him, and led his
forces, after many defeats, to victory over the Regency. Takatoki and
870 of his vas- sals and generals retired to a temple, drank a last cup
of sake, and com- mitted hara- kiri. “This,” said one of them as he
pulled out his intestines with his own hand, “gives a fine relish to the
wine.”“</p>
<p>Ashikaga Takauji turned against the Emperor whom he had helped to
restore, fought with successful stratagem and treachery the armies sent
to subdue him, replaced Go Daigo with the puppet emperor Kogon, and set
up at Kyoto that Ashikaga Shogunate which was to rule Japan through 250
years of chaos and intermittent civil war. It must be admitted that part
of this disorder was due to the nobler side of the Ashikaga dictators —
their love and patronage of art. Yoshimitsu, tired of strife, turned his
hand to painting, and became not the least artist of his time; Yoshimasa
be- friended many painters, subsidized a dozen arts, and grew into so
refined a connoisseur that the pieces selected by him and his associates
are the most coveted prizes of collectors today.“ Meanwhile, however,
the prosaic tasks of organization were neglected, and neither the rich
shoguns nor the impoverished emperors seemed able to maintain public
security or peace.</p>
<p>It was this very chaos and looseness of life, and the call of the
nation for leaders who would give it order, that produced a trio of
buccaneers famous in Japanese history. In their youth, says tradition,
Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu resolved together to restore unity to
their country, and each took a solemn oath that he would obey as vassal
whichever of the others should win the imperial consent to administer
Japan.“ Nobunaga tried first, and failed; Hideyoshi tried second, and
died just short of suc- cess; Iyeyasu bided his time, tried last of all,
founded the Tokugawa Shogunate, and inaugurated one of the longest
periods of peace, and one of the richest epochs of art, in human
history.</p>

<p>known to his friends, and later to his subjects, as Sarumen Kanja —
“Mon - key- Face”; for not even Confucius could rival him in ugliness.
Unable to discipline him, his parents sent him to a monastic school; but
Hideyoshi made such fun of the Buddhist priests, and raised such turmoil
and in- surrections, that he was expelled. He was apprenticed to various
trades, and was discharged thirty-seven times;“ he became a bandit,
decided that more could be stolen by law than against it, joined the
service of a Samu- rai (i.e., a “sword - bearing man”), saved his
master’s life, and was there - after allowed to carry a sword. He joined
Nobunaga, helped him with brains as well as courage, and, when Nobunaga
died (1582), took the lead of the lawless rebels who had set out to
conquer their native land. Within three years Hideyoshi had made himself
ruler of half the empire, had won the admiration of the impotent
emperor, and felt strong enough to dig est Korea and China. “With Korean
troops,” he modestly an -</p>
<p>nounced to the Son of Heaven, “aided by your illustrious influence, I
intend to bring the whole of China under my sway. When that is ef-</p>
<p>fected, the three countries (China, Korea and Japan) will be one. I
shall do it as easily as a man rolls up a piece of matting and carries
it away under his arm.”“ He tried hard; but a villainous Korean invented
a metal war-boat — a pre-plagiarism of the Monitor and the Merrimac —
and de- stroyed one after another of the troop-laden ships that
Hideyoshi had dis- patched to Korea (1592). Seventy-two vessels were
sunk in one day, and the very sea ran blood; forty-eight other vessels
were beached and de- serted by the Japanese, and burned to the water by
the victors. After an indecisive alternation of successes and defeats
the attempt to conquer Korea and China was postponed until the twentieth
century. Hideyoshi, said the Korean king, had tried to “measure the
ocean in a cockle - shell.” 45 Meanwhile Hideyoshi had settled down to
enjoy and administer the Regency that he had established. He provided
himself with three hun- dred concubines, but he bestowed a substantial
sum upon the peasant wife whom he had long ago divorced. He looked up
one of his old employers, and returned to him with interest the money
that he had stolen from him in apprentice days. He did not dare ask the
Emperor’s consent to his assumption of the title of Shogun ; but his
contemporaries gave him, in compensation, the name of Taiko, or “Great
Sovereign,” which, by one of those strange verbal Odysseys that
characterize philology, is now entering our language as tycoon. “Cunning
and crafty beyond belief,” as a missionary described him,“ he subtly
disarmed the people by order-</p>

statue — the Daibutsu, or Great Buddha, of Kyoto. He appears to have
had</p>
<p>no religious beliefs, but he was not above making use of religion for
the purposes of ambition or statesmanship.</p>
<p>Christianity had come to Japan in 1549 in the person of one of
the</p>
<p>first and noblest of Jesuits, St. Francis Xavier. The little
community</p>
<p>which he established grew so rapidly that within a generation after
his coming there were seventy Jesuits and 150,000 converts in the
empire.“ They were so numerous in Nagasaki that they made that trading
port a Christian city, and persuaded its local ruler, Omura, to use
direct action in spreading the new faith.“ “Within Nagasaki territory,”
says Lafcadio Hearn, “Buddhism was totally suppressed— its priests being
persecuted and driven away.”“ Alarmed at this spiritual invasion, and
suspecting it of political designs, Hideyoshi sent a messenger to the
Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits in Japan, armed with five peremptory
questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why, and by what authority, he (the Vice-Provincial) and his</li>
</ol>
<p>religieux (members of religious orders) constrained Hideyoshi’s sub -
jects to become Christians?</p>

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Why he allowed the merchants of his nation to buy Japanese</li>

<p>and make slaves of them in the Indies?“</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the replies, Hideyoshi issued, in 1587, the
follow-</p>
<p>ing edict:</p>
<p>Having learned from our faithful councillors that foreign
religieux</p>
<p>have come into our realm, where they preach a law contrary to that of
Japan, and that they have even had the audacity to destroy temples
dedicated to our (native gods) Kami and Hotoke; although this out-</p>
<p>rage merits the severest punishment, wishing nevertheless to show
them mercy, we order them under pain of death to quit Japan</p>
<p>within twenty days. During that space no harm or hurt will come</p>
<p>o them. But at the expiration of that term, we order that if any
of</p>
<p>hem be found in our States, they shall be seized and punished as the
greatest criminals.“</p>

<p>841</p>
<p>Amid all these alarms the great buccaneer found time to encourage
artists, to take part in No plays, and to support Rikyu in making the
tea ceremony a stimulant to Japanese pottery and an essential adornment
of Japanese life. He died in 1598, having exacted from Iyeyasu a promise
to build a new capital at Yedo (now Tokyo), and to recognize Hide-</p>
<p>yoshi’s son Hideyori as heir to the Regency in Japan.</p>

<p>The accession of Iyeyasu — His philosophy — Iyeyasu and Christi-</p>

<p>Hideyoshi being dead, Iyeyasu pointed out that he had drawn the</p>
<p>blood for his oath not from his finger or his gums, as the code of
the Samurai required, but from a scratch behind his ear; hence the oath
was not binding.” He overwhelmed the forces of certain rival leaders
at</p>
<p>Sekigahara in a battle that left 40,000 dead. He tolerated Hideyori
till his coming of age made him dangerous, and then suggested to him the
wis- dom of submission. Rebuked, he besieged the gigantic Castle of
Osaka where Hideyori was established, captured it while the youth
committed hara- kiri, and ensured his hold upon power by killing all of
Hideyori’s children, legitimate and illegitimate. Then Iyeyasu organized
peace as ably and ruthlessly as he had organized war, and administered
Japan so well that it was content to be ruled by his posterity and his
principles for eight generations.</p>
<p>He was a man of his own ideas, and made his morals as he went along.
When a very presentable woman came to him with the complaint that one of
his officials had killed her husband in order to possess her, Iyeyasu
ordered the official to disembowel himself, and made the lady his con-
cubine.” Like Socrates he ranked wisdom as the only virtue, and charted
some of its paths in that strange “Legacy,” or intellectual testament,
which he bequeathed to his family at his death.</p>
<p>Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden. Let thy
step</p>
<p>be slow and steady, that thou stumble not. Persuade thyself that im-
perfection and inconvenience is the natural lot of mortals, and there
will be no room for discontent, neither for despair. When ambitious
desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast</p>
<p>passed through. Forbearance is the root of quietness and
assurance</p>

<p>forever. Look upon wrath as thy enemy. If thou knowest only</p>
<p>what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated, woe
unto thee; it will fare ill with thee. Find fault with thyself
rather</p>
<p>han with others.“</p>
<p>Having captured power by arms, he decided that Japan had no need of
further war, and devoted himself to furthering the ways and virtues of
peace. To win the Samurai from the habits of the sword he encouraged
them to study literature and philosophy, and to contribute to the arts;
and under the rule which he established, culture flourished in Japan and
mili- tarism decayed. “The people,” he wrote, “are the foundation of th
e Empire,”“ and he invoked the “special commiseration” of his successors
for the “widower, the widowed, the orphaned and the lonely.” But he had
no democratic predispositions: the greatest of all crimes, he thought,
was insubordination; a “fellow” who stepped out of his rank was to be
cut down on the spot; and the entire family of a rebel should be put to
death.“ The feudal order, in his judgment, was the best that could be
devised for actual human beings; it provided a rational balance between
central and local power, it established a natural and hereditary system
of social and economic organization, and it preserved the continuity of
a society without subjecting it to despotic authority. It must be
admitted that Iyeyasu organized the most perfect form of feudal
government ever known. 67</p>
<p>Like most statesmen he thought of religion chiefly as an organ of</p>
<p>social discipline, and regretted that the variety of human beliefs
canceled half this good by the disorder of hostile creeds. To his
completely polit- ical mind the traditional faith of the Japanese people
— a careless mixture of Shintoism and Buddhism — was an invaluable bond
cementing the race into spiritual unity, moral order and patriotic
devotion; and though at first he approached Christianity with the
lenient eye and broad intelli- gence of Akbar, and refrained from
enforcing against it the angry edicts of Hideyoshi, he was disturbed by
its intolerance, its bitter denunciation of the native faith as
idolatry, and the discord which its passionate dog- matism aroused not
only between the converts and the nation, but among the neophytes
themselves. Finally his resentment was stirred by the dis- covery that
missionaries sometimes allowed themselves to be used as van- guards for
conquerors, and were, here and there, conspiring against the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE MAKERS OF JAPAN 843</p>
<p>Japanese state. 58 * In 1614 he forbade the practice or preaching of
the Christian religion in Japan, and ordered all converts either to
depart from the country or to renounce their new beliefs. Many priests
evaded the decree, and some of them were arrested. None was executed
during the lifetime of Iyeyasu; but after his death the fury of the
bureaucrats was turned against the Christians, and a violent and brutal
persecution ensued which practically stamped Christianity out of Japan.
In 1638 the remaining Christians gathered to the number of 37,000 on the
peninsula of Shima- bara, fortified it, and made a last stand for the
freedom of worship.</p>
<p>Iyemitsu, grandson of Iyeyasu, sent a large armed force to subdue
them. When, after a three months’ siege, their stronghold was taken, all
but one hundred and five of the survivors were massacred in the
streets.</p>
<p>Iyeyasu and Shakespeare were contemporaries in death. The doughty
Shogun left his power to his son Hidetada, with a simple admonition:
“Take care of the people. Strive to be virtuous. Never neglect to
protect</p>
<p>His descendants conducted themselves much better than monarchs can
usually be expected to behave over a great length of time. Hidetada was
a harmless mediocrity; Iyemitsu represented a stronger mood of the
stock, and sternly suppressed a movement to restore to actual power the
still reigning but not ruling emperors. Tsunayoshi lavished patronage
upon men of letters, and on the great rival schools of painting, Kano
and Tosa, that embellished the Genroku age (1688-1703). Yoshimune set

Japanese boats, was purposely driven by them upon a reef that broke it
in two, and then was pillaged by the local governor on the ground that
Japanese law permitted the authorities to appro- priate all vessels
stranded on their shores. The outraged pilot, Landecho, protested to
Hideyoshi’s Minister of Works, Masuda. Mas uda asked how it was that the
Christian Church had won so many lands to be subject to one man; and
Landecho, being a seaman rather than a diplomat, answered: “Our kings
begin by sending, into the countries they wish to conquer, religieux who
induce the people to embrace our religion; and when they have made
considerable progress, troops are sent who combine with the new
Christians; and then our kings have not much trouble in accomplishing
the rest.” 68</li>
