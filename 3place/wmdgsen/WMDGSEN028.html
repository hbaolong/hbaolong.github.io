<p>T HOSE forces took the form of the Industrial Revolution. A
Europe</p>
<p>vitalized and rejuvenated by the discovery of mechanical power and
its application to ever-multiplying machinery, found itself capable of
pro- ducing goods more cheaply than any nation or continent that still
relied on handicrafts; it was unable to dispose of all these machine
products to its own population, because it paid its workers somewhat
less than the full value of their labor; it was forced to seek foreign
markets for the surplus, and was driven, by imperialist necessity, to
conquer the world. Under the compulsions of invention and circumstance
the nineteenth century became a world-wide drama of conflict between the
old, mature and fatigued civilizations of handicraft Asia, and the
young, jejune, and invigorated civilizations of industrial Europe.</p>
<p>The Commercial Revolution of Columbus’ time cleared the routes and
prepared the way for the Industrial Revolution. Discoverers refound old
lands, opened up new ports, and brought to the ancient cultures the
novel products and ideas of the West. Early in the sixteenth century the
ad- venturous Portuguese, having established themselves in India,
captured Malacca, sailed around the Malay Peninsula, and arrived with
their pic- turesque ships and terrible guns at Canton (1517). “Truculent
and law - less, regarding all Eastern peoples as legitimate prey, they
were little if any better than . . . pirates”; 1 and the natives treated
them as such. Their rep - resentatives were imprisoned, their demands
for free trade were refused, and their settlements were periodically
cleansed with massacres by the</p>
<p>803</p>
<p>804 the story of civilization (chap. XXVII</p>
<p>frightened and infuriated Chinese. But in return for their aid
against other pirates, the Portuguese were rewarded in 1557 by receiving
from Peking full liberty to settle in Macao, and to govern it as their
own. There they built great opium factories, employing men, women and
children; one fac- tory alone paid to the Portuguese provincial
government a revenue of ,560,000 per year. 2</p>
<p>Then came the Spanish, conquering the Philippines (1571), and setting
themselves up in the Chinese island of Formosa; then the Dutch; then, in
1637, five English vessels sailed up the river to Canton, silenced with
su- perior guns the batteries that opposed them, and disposed of their
cargo.* The Portuguese taught the Chinese to smoke and buy tobacco, and,
early in the eighteenth century, began the importation of opium from
India into China. The Chinese Government forbade its use by the people,
but the habit became so widespread that the annual consumption of the
drug in China had raised its import to 4,000 chests by the year 1795.*
The Gov- ernment prohibited its importation in that year, and reiterated
the prohi- bition in 1800, appealing to importers and population alike
against the weakening of national vitality by this powerful opiate. The
trade pro- ceeded briskly despite these discouragements; the Chinese
were as anxious to buy as the Europeans were eager to sell, and the
local officials gratefully pocketed the bribes connected with the
trade.</p>
<p>In 1838 the Peking Government ordered the strict enforcement of the
edict against the importation of opium, and a vigorous official, Lin
Tze- hsii, commanded the foreign importers at Canton to surrender such
quan- tities as they held in their stores. When they refused he
surrounded the foreign quarters, forced them to turn over to him 20,000
chests of the drug, and, in a kind of Canton Opium Party, destroyed the
contents com-</p>
<p>pletely. The British withdrew to Hong Kong, and began the Firs t
“Opium War.” They protested that it was not an opium war; that their
anger was rather at the insolent pride with which the Chinese Government
had re- ceived — or refused to receive — their representatives, and at
the impediments, in the form of severe taxation and corrupt courts,
which Chinese law and custom had raised against an orderly import trade.
They bombarded those cities of China which they could reach from the
coast, and compelled peace by capturing control, at Chinkiang, of the
Grand Canal. The Treaty</p>
<p>•The meaning of this may be felt by recalling that a vest -pocket
package of opium costs 0.*</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 805</p>
<p>of Nanking avoided all mention of opium, ceded the island of Hong
Kong to the British, forced Chinese tariffs down to five per cent,
opened five “treaty ports” (Canton, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo and Shanghai)
to</p>
<p>foreign trade, levied upon China an indemnity to cover the cost of
the war and the destroyed opium, and stipulated that British citizens in
China, when accused of violating laws, should be tried and judged only
by British courts. 6 Other countries, including the United States and
France, asked and obtained the application of these “extra - territorial
rights” to their traders and nationals in China.</p>
<p>This war was the beginning of the disintegration of the ancient
regime. The Government had lost “face” in its dealings with Europeans;
it had first scorned, then defied, then yielded; and no courtly phrases
could con- ceal the facts from educated natives or gloating foreigners.
At once the authority of the Government was weakened wherever the news
of its defeat penetrated, and forces that might have held their peace
broke out now in open rebellion against Peking. In 1843 an enthusiast
named Hung Hsiu- ch’uan, after a brief acquaintance with Protestantism,
and some vi - sions, came to the conclusion that he had been chosen by
God to rid China of idolatry and convert it to Christianity. Beginning
with this modest pur- pose, Hung finally led a movement to overthrow the
Manchus and estab- lish a new dynasty — the T’ai P’ing, or Great Peace.
His followers, actuated</p>
<p>In the midst of this dangerous T’ai - p’ing Rebellion the Government
was called upon to defend itself against Europe in the Second “Opium
War” (1856-60). Great Britain, supported in varying degrees by France
and the United States, demanded the legalization of the opium traffic
(which had continued, despite prohibitions, between the wars), access to
more cities, and the honorable admission of Western envoys to the court
at Peking. When the Chinese refused, the French and English captured
Can- ton, sent its Viceroy in chains to India, took the forts at
Tientsin, ad- vanced upon the capital, and destroyed the Summer Palace
in revenge for</p>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>the torture and execution of Allied emissaries in Peking. The
victors</p>
<p>forced upon the defeated a treaty that opened ten new ports and the
Yang- tze River to foreign trade, arranged for the reception of European
and American ministers and ambassadors on terms of equality with China,
guaranteed toleration of missionaries and traders in every part of the
country, removed missionaries from the jurisdiction of Chinese
officials, further freed Western nationals from the operation of Chinese
laws, ceded to Great Britain a strip of the mainland opposite Hong Kong,
legalized the importation of opium, and charged China with an indemnity
to pay for the cost of her tuition in Occidental ways.</p>
<p>Encouraged by their easy victories, the European nations proceeded to
help themselves to one piece of China after another. Russia took the
terri- tory north of the Amur and east of the Ussuri River (i860); the
French revenged the death of a missionary by appropriating Indo-China
(1885); Japan pounced upon her neighbor and civilizer in a sudden war
(1894), defeated her in a year, took Formosa, liberated Korea from China
for later (1910) absorption by Japan, and charged China an indemnity of
70,- 000,000 for causing so m uch trouble.’ On condition that China pay
an additional indemnity to Japan, Russia prevented Japan from also
taking the Liaotung Peninsula, which three years later Russia took over
and forti- fied as her own. The murder of two missionaries by Chinese
enabled Ger- many to seize the peninsula of Shantung (1898). The realm
of the once powerful government was divided into “spheres of influence,”
in which one or another European power secured special privileges for
mining and trade. Alarmed by the prospects of an actual partition,
Japan, foreseeing her own later need of China, joined with America in a
demand for an “Open Door”: that is, that while certain “spheres of
interest” might be recognized, all nations should be allowed to trade in
China on equal terms — tariffs and transport charges to be the same for
all. To put herself in a proper position for bargaining in these
matters, the United States took over the Philippines (1898), and
declared by this act her intention to share in the struggle for Chinese
trade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile another and simultaneous act of the drama was being played
behind palace walls in Peking. When the Allies entered the capital in
triumph at the close of the Second “Opium War” (i860), the young em -
peror, Hsien Feng, fled to Jehol; there, a year later, he died, leaving
the throne to his five-year-old son. The secondary wife who had been the
mother of this boy took the reins of empire in her own hands, and as
Tz’u</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 807</p>
<p>Hsi — known to the world as the “Dowager Empress”*— governed China
ruthlessly, cynically and well for a generation. In her youth she had
ruled by beauty; now she ruled by her wits and her will. When the son
con- veniently died on approaching his majority (1875), the Empress,
careless of precedent and objection, placed another minor — Kuang Hsu —
on the throne, and continued to rule. For a generation, with the help of
clever statesmen like Li Hung-chang, the doughty Empress kept China at
peace and won for it a certain respect from the predatory Powers. But
the sudden invasion of China by Japan, and the rapid series of
renewed</p>
<p>spoliations by Europe after the triumph of the Japanese, caused a
strong movement to rise in the capital in favor of imitating Japan’s
imitation o f the West — i.e., for organizing a large army, building
railroads and factories, and striving to acquire the industrial wealth
with which Japan and Europe had financed their victories. The Empress
and her advisers opposed this tendency with all their influence, but it
secretly won the adherence of Kuang Hsu, who had now been permitted to
ascend the throne as emperor in his own right. Suddenly Kuang, without
consulting “Old Buddha” (as her court called the Empress), issued to the
Chinese people (1898) a series of astonishing decrees which, if they
could have been accepted and en- forced, would have advanced China
vigorously and yet peaceably on the road to Westernization, and might
have averted the fall of the dynasty and the collapse of the nation into
chaos and misery. The young emperor ordered the establishment of a new
system of schools, to teach not only the old Confucian Classics, but the
scientific culture of the West; the translation into Chinese of all the
important works of Occidental science, literature and technology; the
encouragement of railroad building; and the reform of the army and the
navy with a definite view to meeting the “crisis,” as he put it, “where
we are beset on all sides by powerful</p>
<p>neighbors who craftily seek advantage from us, and who are trying to
combine together in overpowering us.” 8 The Dowager Empress, shocked by
what seemed to her the precipitate radicalism of these edicts, impris-
oned Kuang Hsu in one of the imperial palaces, annulled his decrees, and
made herself again the government of China.</p>
<p>A reaction now set in against all Western ideas, and the subtle Dow-
ager diverted it amiably to her purposes. An organization known as the /

a gesture of generosity, which proved more effective in the undoing of
old China than almost any other single factor in this historic and
tragic conflict of East and West.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 809</p>
<p>at an early and impressionable age, before they had matured to the
point of understanding the depth and values of their own national
culture. They drank in with gratitude and admiration the novel education
given in the science, methods, history and ideas of the West; they were
amazed at the comforts and vigorous life they saw about them, the
freedom of the Western individual, and the enfranchisement of the
people. They studied Western philosophy, lost faith in the religion of
their fathers, and enjoyed the position of respectable radicals
encouraged by their educators and their new environment in their
rebellion against all the elements in the civilization of their native
land. Year by year thousands of such deraci- nated youths returned to
China, fretted against the slow tempo and ma- terial backwardness of
their country, and sowed in every city the seeds of inquiry and
revolt.</p>
<p>An endless chain of circumstances helped them. For two generations
the merchants and missionaries who had conquered China from the West had
acted, willingly or not, as centers of foreign infection; they had lived
in a style, and with such comforts and conveniences, as made the young
Chinese about them anxious to adopt so promising a civilization; they
had undermined, in an active minority, the religious faith that had
supported the old moral code; they had set one generation against
another by advo- cating the abandonment of ancestor worship; and though
they preached a gentle Jesus meek and mild, they were protected in
emergencies by guns whose size and efficacy offered the dominating
lesson of Europe to the Orient. Christianity, which had been in its
origin an uprising of the op- pressed, became once more, in these
Chinese converts, a ferment of revolu- tion.</p>
<p>Among the converts was the leader of the Revolution. In 1866 a</p>
<p>tenant farmer near Canton fathered a troublesome boy whom the world,
with no conscious sarcasm, was to christen Sun Yat-sen — i.e., Sun,</p>
<p>the Fairy of Tranquillity.” Sun became so Christian that he defaced
the images of the gods in the temple of his native village. An older
brother, who had migrated to Hawaii, brought the boy to Honolulu and
placed him in a school conducted by an Anglican bishop and offering a
thoroughly Occidental education. 11 Returning to China, Sun entered the
British Medical College, and became its first Chinese graduate. Largely
as a result of these studies he lost all religious faith;” and at the
same time the indignities to which he found himself and his fellow
Chinese subjected at the foreign- controlled customs offices and in the
foreign quarters of the treaty ports 8X0 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION
(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>turned his thoughts to revolution. The inability of a corrupt and
reaction- ary government to prevent the defeat of great China by little
Japan, or the commercial partition of the country by European powers,
filled him with humiliation and resentment, and made him feel that the
first step in the liberation of China must be the overthrow of the
Manchu dynasty.</p>
<p>His first move was characteristic of his self-confidence, his
idealism, and his simplicity. He boarded a steamer and traveled sixteen
hundred miles north, at his own expense, to lay before Li Hung-chang,
vice-regent of the Empress Dowager, his plans for reforming the country
and restoring its prestige. Refused a hearing, Sun began a lifetime of
adventure and wandering in the quest of funds for a Chinese revolution.
He won the support of many mercantile guilds and powerful secret
societies, whose leaders were envious of the imperial aristocracy, and
longed for a govern- ment in which the new manufacturing and trading
classes would play a role commensurate with their rising wealth. Then he
traveled overseas to America and Europe, gathering modest sums from a
million laundrymen and a thousand Chinese merchants. In London the
Chinese Legation il- legally arrested him, and was about to send him
secretly to China in chains as a traitor to his government, when a
missionary who had taught him in his youth aroused the British
Government to rescue him. For fifteen years more he passed from city to
city over the world, collecting all in all two and a half million
dollars for the Revolution; and apparently he spent almost none of this
money on himself. Suddenly, in the midst of his travels, a message
informed him that the revolutionary forces had won the south, were
winning the north, and had chosen him as Provisional President of the
Chinese Republic. A few weeks later he landed in triumph at Hong</p>
<p>Kong, where, twenty years back, he had been humiliated by the British
officials of the port.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager had died in 1908, having arranged the death</p>
<p>of the imprisoned emperor Kuang Hsu the day before. She was suc-</p>
<p>ceeded by Kuang’s nephew, P’u Yi, now Emperor of Manchukuo. In
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 8 1 1</p>
<p>this program added: “Any impetuosity shown in introducing these re -
forms will, in the end, be so much labor lost.” 13 But the Revolution
could not be halted by this deathbed repentance of an ailing dynasty.
On</p>
<p>February 12, 1912, the young Emperor, faced by revolt on every side
and finding no army willing to defend him, abdicated; and the Regent,
Prince Ch’un, issued one of the most characteristic edicts in Chin ese
history:</p>
<p>Today the people of the whole Empire have their minds bent</p>
<p>upon a Republic The will of Providence is clear, and the people’s</p>
<p>wishes are plain. How could I, for the sake of the glory and the</p>
<p>honor of one family, thwart the desire of teeming millions?
Where-</p>
<p>fore I, with the Emperor, decide that the form of government in</p>
<p>China shall be a constitutional republic, to comfort the longing of
all within the Empire, and to act in harmony with the ancient sages,</p>
<p>who regarded the throne as a public heritage. 1 *</p>
<p>The Revolutionists behaved magnanimously to P’u Yi: they gave him his
life, a comfortable palace, an ample annuity, and a concubine. The
Manchus had come in like lions, and had gone out like lambs.</p>
<p>The new republic paid for its peaceful birth with a stormy life.
Yuan</p>
<p>Shi-kai, a diplomat of the old school, possessed an army that might
have impeded the Revolution. He demanded the presidency as the price of
his support; and Sun Yat-sen, only beginning to enjoy his office,
yielded and retired magnificently to private life. Yuan, encouraged by
strong financial groups native and foreign, plotted to make himself
emperor and to found a new dynasty, on the ground that only in this way
could the incipient break-up of China be stayed. Sun Yat-sen branded him
as a traitor, and called upon his followers to renew the Revolution; but
before the issue could come to battle Yuan took sick and died.</p>
<p>China has not known order or unity since. Sun Yat-sen proved too</p>
<p>idealistic, too good an orator and too poor a statesman, to take the
reins and guide his nation to peace. He passed from one plan and theory
to an- other, offended his middle-class supporters by his apparent
acceptance of communism, and retired to Canton to teach and inspire its
youth and occa- sionally to rule its people.* China, left without a
government that all sections would recognize, deprived of the unifying
symbol of the mon- archy, broken of its habit of obedience to custom and
law, and weak in the patriotism that attaches the soul not to a district
but to the country</p>

sec- tion against section, of property against hunger, of old against
young. Adventurers organized armies, ruled as tuchuns over isolated
provinces, levied their own taxes, raised their own opium, 1 ’ and
sallied forth occa- sionally to annex new victims to their subject
population. Industry and trade, taxed by one victorious general after
another, fell into disorder and despair; bandits exacted tribute, stole
and killed, and no organized force could control them. Men became
soldiers or thieves lest they should starve, and ravaged the fields of
men who, so despoiled, became soldiers or thieves lest they should
starve. The savings of a lifetime or the modest stores of a thrifty
family were, as often as not, appropriated by a general or looted by a
robber band. In the province of Honan alone, in 1931, there were 400,000
bandits. 1 *</p>
<p>In the midst of this chaos (1922) Russia sent two of its ablest
diplo-</p>
<p>mats, Karakhan and Joffe, with orders to bring China into the circle
of the Communist Revolution. Karakhan prepared the way by surrendering
Russia’s claims to “extra - territoriality,” and by signing a treaty
that rec - ognized the full authority and international status of the
revolutionary government. The subtle Joffe found little difficulty in
converting Sun Yat-sen to sympathy with communism, for Sun had been
rebuffed by every other power. In an incredibly short time, with the
help of seventy Soviet officers, a new Nationalist army was formed and
trained. Under command of Sun’s fo rmer secretary Chiang Kai-shek, but
guided largely by a Russian adviser, Michael Borodin, this army marched
northward from Canton, conquered one city after another, and finally
established its power in Peking.* In the moment of victory the victors
divided; Chiang Kai-shek attacked the communist movement in Oriental
style, and estab- lished a military dictatorship realistically
responsive to the will of business and finance.</p>
<p>It is as difficult for a nation as for an individual to take no
comfort from a neighbor’s misfortune. Japan, which in the plans of Sun
Yat -sen, was to be the friend and ally of China against the West, and
which had stimu- lated the Chinese revolt by her swift and successful
imitation of Europe in industry, diplomacy and war, saw in the disorder
and weakness of her</p>

<p>ancient teacher an opportunity for solving the problems that had
arisen out of her very success. For Japan could not discourage the
growth of her population without endangering her capacity for
self-defense against obviously possible aggression; she could not
support an increasing popu- lation unless she developed industry and
trade; she could not develop industry without importing iron, coal and
other resources in which her own soil was deficient, nor could she
develop trade profitably unless she had a large share in the only great
market left free by the European colonization of the globe. But China
was supposedly rich in iron and coal, and offered, at Japan’s door,
potentially the greatest market in the world. What nation, faced with
the apparent choice between returning to agri- culture and subjection,
or advancing to industrial imperialism and con- quest, could have
resisted the temptation to snatch the prizes of pros- trate China while
the other imperial vultures were tearing one another’s throats on the
fields of France?</p>
<p>So Japan, soon after the outbreak of the Great War, declared herself
at war with Germany, and pounced upon the Kiaochow territory which
Germany had “leased” from China sixteen years before. Then she pre -
sented to the government of Yuan Shi- kai “Twenty - One Demands” which
would have made China a political and economic colony of Japan; and only
the protest of the United States and the boycott of Japanese goods in
China under the leadership of its enraged students prevented these
commands from being enforced. Students wept in the streets, or killed
themselves, in shame at the humiliation of their country.” The J apanese
listened with cynical humor to the moral indignation of a Europe that
had been gnawing at China for half a century, and waited patiently</p>
<p>for another opportunity. It came when Europe and America were en-
gulfed in the debacle of an imperialist industry that had depended upon
foreign markets for the absorption of “surplus” products unpurchasable
by their producers at home. Japan marched into Manchuria, set up the
former emperor of China, P’u Yi, first as president, then as emperor, of
the new state of Manchukuo, and by political alliance, economic penetra-
tion and military control, placed herself in a favored position for the
exploitation of Manchuria’s natural resources, employable population and
commercial possibilities. The European world, which had proposed a
moratorium on robbery after it had gathered in all available spoils,
joined America feebly in protests against this candid plunder, but
prepared, as always, to accept victory as justification in the end.</p>

<p>The final humiliation came at Shanghai. Angered by the successful</p>
<p>boycott of her goods, Japan landed her undefeated troops at the
richest port in China, occupied and destroyed the district of Chapei,
and de- manded the restraint of the boycott associations by the Chinese
Govern- ment. The Chinese defended themselves with a new heroism, and
the Nineteenth Route Army from Canton, almost unaided, held the well-
equipped forces of Japan at bay for two months. The Nanking Govern- ment
offered a compromise, Japan withdrew from Shanghai, and China, nursing
its wounds, resolved to build from the bottom a new and more vigorous
civilization, capable of preserving and defending itself against a
rapacious world.</p>

<p>Once everything changed except the East; now there is nothing in the
East that does not change. The most conservative nation in history has
suddenly become, after Russia, the most radical, and is destroying with
a will customs and institutions once held inviolate. It is not merely
the end of a dynasty, as in 1644; it is the moulting of a
civilization.</p>
<p>Change comes last and least to the village, for the slow sobriety of
the soil does not encourage innovation; even the new generation must
plant in order to reap. But now seven thousand miles of railroad
traverse the countryside; and though a decade of chaos and native
management has left them in bad repair, and war has conscripted them too
often for its purposes, yet they bind the eastern villages with the
cities of the coast, and daily bear their trickle of Western novelties
into a million peasant homes. Here one may find such foreign-devilish
importations as kero- sene, kerosene lamps, matches, cigarettes, even
American wheat; for sometimes, so poor is transport, it costs more to
carry goods from the Chinese interior to the marine provinces than it
does to bring them to these from Australia or the United States.“ It
becomes clear that the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 8 1 5</p>
<p>economic growth of a civilization depends upon transportation. Twenty
thousand miles of dirt roads have been built, over which, with Oriental
irregularity, six thousand buses travel, always full. When the gasoline
engine has bound these innumerable villages together it will have accom-
plished one of the greatest changes in Chinese history — the end of
famine.</p>
<p>In the towns the triumph of the West goes on more rapidly. Handi-</p>
<p>crafts are dying under the competition of cheaply-transported
machine- made goods from abroad; millions of artisans flounder about in
unemploy- ment, and are drawn into the jaws of the factories that
foreign and do- mestic capital is building along the coast. The hand
loom, still spinning in the village, is silent in the city; imported
cotton and cotton cloths flood the country, and textile factories rise
to induct impoverished Chinese into the novel serfdom of the mill. Great
blast-furnaces bum at Hankow, as weird and horrible as any in the West.
Canneries, bakeries, cement works, chemical works, breweries,
distilleries, power works, glass works, shoe factories, paper mills,
soap and candle factories, sugar refineries — all of them have now been
planted on Chinese soil, and slowly transform the domestic artisan into
a factory hand. The development of the new in- dustries is retarded
because investment hesitates in a world disordered by permanent
revolution; it is obstructed further by the difficulty and cost- liness
of transport, by the inadequacy of local raw materials, and by that
amiable Chinese habit which places the family above every other loyalty,
and turns every native office and factory into a nest of genial nepotism
and incompetence.“ Commerce, too, is impeded by inland tariffs and
coastal customs, and the universal demand for bribes or “squeeze”; 20
but it is growing more, rapidly than industry, and plays the central
role in the economic transformation of China.*</p>
<p>The new industries have destroyed the guilds, and have thrown into
chaos the relations of employer and employee. The guilds had lived by
regulating wages and prices through agreements between owners and
workers whose products had no rivals in local trade; but as transport
and commerce increased, and brought distant goods to compete in every
town with the handiwork of the guilds, it was found impossible to
control prices or to regulate wages without surrendering to the dictates
of foreign</p>
<ul>
<li>Once Great Britain dominated the import trade; now it accounts for
14per, the United States for 17per, Japan for 27per; a and the Japanese
leadership in this field mounts with every year. Between 1910 and 1930
Chinese trade increased 600per to approximately one and a half billion
dollars. 22</li>
</ul>
<p>8i6</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>competitors and capital. The guilds have therefore disintegrated and
divided into chambers of commerce on the one side and labor unions on
the other. The chambers discuss order, loyalty and economic liberty, and
the workers discuss starvation. Strikes and boycotts are frequent, but
they have been more successful in compelling foreign concessions to the
Chin- ese Government than in raising the remuneration of labor. In 1928
the Department of Social Affairs of the Chinese Municipality of Shanghai
computed the average weekly wage of the textile-mill workers as varying
from .73 to .76 for men, and from .10 to .78 for women. In flour mills
the male weekly average pay was .96; in cement mills .72; in glass works
11-84; in match-factories .11; among the skilled workers of the electric
power plants, .10; in the machine shops, .24; among the printers, . 5 5.
23 The wealth enjoyed by the printers was doubtless due to their better
organization, and the cost of suddenly replacing them. The first unions
were formed in 1919; they grew in number and power until, in the days of
Borodin, they proposed to take over the management of China; they were
repressed ruthlessly after Chiang Kai- shek’s break with Russia; today
the laws against them are severe, but they multiply nevertheless as the
sole refuge of the workers against an industrial system that has only
begun to pass labor legislation, and has not yet begun to enforce it. 24
The bitter destitution of the city proletaires, working twelve hours a
day, hovering on the margin of subsistence, and facing starvation if
employment should fail, is worse than the ancient poverty of the vil-
lage, where the poor could not see the rich, and accepted their lot as
the natural and immemorial fate of mankind.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of these evils might have been avoided if the
politi-</p>
<p>cal transformation of eastern China had not been so rapid and com-
plete. The mandarin aristocracy, though it had lost vitality and was
dis- honored with corruption, might have held the new industrial forces
in check until China could accept them without chaos or slavery; and</p>
<p>then the growth of industry would have generated year by year a new
class that might have stepped peaceably into political power, as the
man- ufacturers had displaced the landed aristocracy of England. But the
new government found itself without an army, without experienced
leaders, and without funds; the Kuomintang, or People’s Party,
established to liber - ate a nation, found that it must stand by while
foreign and domestic capital subjugated it; conceived in democrary and
baptized with the blood of communism, it became dependent upon Shanghai
bankers, abandoned</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 817</p>
<p>democracy for dictatorship, and tried to destroy the unions.* For the
Party depends upon the army, and the army upon money, and money upon
loans; until the Army is strong enough to conquer China the Gov- ernment
cannot tax China; and until it can tax China the Government must take
advice where it takes its funds. Even so it has accomplished much. It
has brought back to China full control over her tariffs and</p>
<p>— within the internationalism of finance — over her industries; it
has or- ganized, trained and equipped an Army which may some day be used
against others than Chinese; it has enlarged the area that acknowledges
its authority, and has reduced, in that area, the banditry that was
stifling the nation’s economic life. It takes a day to make a
revolution, and a generation to make a government.</p>
<p>The disunity of China reflects and follows from the division that
lies</p>
<p>in the Chinese soul. The most powerful feeling in China today is
hatred of foreigners; the most powerful process in China today is
imitation of foreigners. China knows that the West does not deserve this
flattery, but China is forced by the very spirit and impetus of the
times to give it, for the age offers to all nations the choice of
industrialism or vassalage. So the Chinese of the eastern cities pass
from fields to factories, from robes to trousers, from the simple
melodies of the past to the saxophone sym- phonies of the West; they
surrender their own fine taste in dress and furniture and art, adorn
their walls with European paintings, and erect office buildings in the
least attractive of American styles. Their women have ceased to compress
their feet from north to south, and begin, in the superior manner of the
Occident, to compress them from east to west.f Their philosophers
abandon the unobtrusive and mannerly rationalism of Confucius, and take
up with Renaissance enthusiasm the pugnacious rationalism of Moscow,
London, Berlin, Paris and New York.</p>
<p>The dethronement of Confucius has something of the character of</p>
<p>both the Renaissance and the Enlightenment; it is at once the
overthrow of the Chinese Aristotle, and the rejection of the racial
gods. For a time the new state persecuted Buddhism and the monastic
orders; like the Revolutionists of France, the Chinese rebels were
freethinkers without concealment, openly hostile to religion, and
worshiping only reason. Con- fucianism tolerated the popular faiths on
the assumption, presumably, that * In 1927 alone many thousands of
workers were executed for belonging to labor unions. 28</p>
<p>t Some Chinese women pad their shoes to conceal the fact that their
feet were bound. 20</p>
<p>8 1 8</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>as long as there is poverty there will be gods; the Revolution,
fondly be- lieving that poverty can be destroyed, had no need of gods.
Confucianism took agriculture and the family for granted, and formulated
an ethic de- signed to maintain order and content within the circle of
the home and the field; the Revolution is bound for industry, and needs
a new morality to accord with urban and individual life. Confucianism
endured because access to political office and scholarly occupations
demanded a knowledge and acceptance of it; but the examinations are
gone, and science takes the place of ethical and political philosophy in
the schools; man is now to be moulded not to government but to industry.
Confucianism was con- servative, and checked the ideals of youth with
the caution of old age; the Revolution is made of youth, and will have
none of these ancient restraints; it smiles at the old sage’s warning
that “he who thinks the old embankments useless and destroys them is
sure to suffer from the desola- tion caused by overflowing water .”*
11</p>
<p>The Revolution has, of course, put an end to official religion, and
no sacrifice mounts any longer from the Altar of Heaven to the
impersonal and silent T’ien. Ancestor worship is tolerated, but visibly
decays; more and more the men tend to leave it to the women, who were
once thought unfit to officiate at these sacred rites. Half of the
Revolutionary leaders were educated in Christian schools; but the
Revolution, despite the Meth- odism of Chiang Kai-shek, is unfavorable
to any supernatural faith, and gives to its schoolbooks an atheistic
tint . 28 The new religion, which tries to fill the emotional void left
by the departure of the gods, is nationalism, as in Russia it is
communism. Meanwhile this creed does not satisfy all; many proletaires
seek in the adventure of oracles and mediums a refuge from the prose of
their daily toil; and the people of the village still find some solace
from their poverty in the mystic quiet of the ancient shrines.</p>
<p>Shorn of its sanctions in government, religion and economic life, the
traditional moral code, which seemed a generation ago unchangeable,
disintegrates with geometrical acceleration. Next to the invasion of in-
dustry the most striking change in the China of today is the destruction
of the old family system, and its replacement with an individualism that
leaves every man free and alone to face the world. Loyalty to the fam-
ily, on which the old order was founded, is superseded in theory by</p>
<p>loyalty to the state; and as the novel loyalty has not yet graduated
from</p>
<ul>
<li>P. 673 above. Latterly the “New Life” movement, let by Chiang Kai
-shek, has at- tempted, with some success, to restore Confucianism.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 819</p>
<p>theory into practice, the new society lacks a moral base. Agriculture
favors the family because, before the coming of machinery, the land
could most economically be tilled by a group united by blood and
paternal authority; industry disrupts the family, because it offers its
places and rewards to individuals rather than to groups, does not always
offer them these rewards in the same place, and recognizes no obligation
to aid the weak out of the resources of the strong; the natural
communism of the family finds no support in the bitter competition of
industry and trade. The younger generation, always irked by the
authority of the old, takes with a will to the anonymity of the city and
the individualism of the</p>
<p>“job.” Perhaps the omnipotence of t he father helped to precipitate
the Revolution; the reactionary is always to blame for the excesses of
the radical. So China has cut itself off from all roots, and no one
knows</p>
<p>whether it can sink new roots in time to save its cultural life.</p>
<p>The old marriage forms disappear with the authority of the
family.</p>
<p>The majority of marriages are still arranged by the parents, but in
the city marriage by free choice of the young tends more and more to
pre- vail. The individual considers himself free not only to mate as he
pleases, but to make experiments in marriage which might shock the
West.</p>
<p>Nietzsche thought Asia right about women, and considered their
subjec- tion the only alternative to their unchecked ascendancy; but
Asia is choos- ing Europe’s way, not Nietzsche’s. Polygamy diminishes,
for the modern wife objects to a concubine. Divorce is uncommon, but the
road to it is wider than ever before.* Co-education is the rule in the
universities, and the free mingling of the sexes is usual in the cities.
Women have estab- lished their own law and medical schools, even their
own bank.” Those of them that are members of the Party have received the
franchise, and places have been found for them on the highest committees
of both the Party and the Government . 32 They have turned their backs

consent of the parents is required for a divorce. The old causes for
which the husband may divorce his wife remain in force- barrenness,
infidelity, neglect of duty, loquacity, thievishness, jealousy, or
serious dis - ease; but these are not allowed to apply if the wife has
mourned three years for her husband’s parents, or has no family to
return to, or has been faithful to her husband during his rise from
poverty to wealth . 30</li>

<p>noticeably increased since the Revolution; perhaps the vast tide of
Chinese humanity has begun to ebb”</p>
<p>Nevertheless fifty thousa nd new Chinese are born every day.“
They</p>
<p>are destined to be new in every way: new in the cut of their clothes
and their hair, new in education and occupation, in habits and manners,
in religion and philosophy. The queue is gone, and so are the graceful
manners of the older time; the hatreds of revolution have coarsened the
spirit, and radicals find it hard to be courteous to conservatives.® The
phlegmatic quality of the ancient race is being changed by the speed of
industry into something more expressive and volatile; these stolid faces
conceal active and excitable souls. The love of peace that came to China
after centuries of war is being broken down by the contemplation of
national dismemberment and defeat; the schools are drilling every
student into a soldier, and the general is a hero once more.</p>
<p>The whole world of education has been transformed. The schools</p>
<p>have thrown Confucius out of the window, and taken science in. The
rejection was not quite necessary for the admission, since the doctrine
of Confucius accorded well with the spirit of science; but the conquest
of the logical by the psychological is the warp and woof of history.</p>
<p>Mathematics and mechanics are popular, for these can make machines;
machines can make wealth and guns, and guns may preserve liberty.
Medical education is progressing, largely as the result of the
cosmopoli- tan beneficence of the Rockefeller fortune.* Despite the
impoverish- ment of the country, new schools, high schools and colleges
have multi- plied rapidly, and the hope of Young China is that soon
every child will receive a free education, and that democracy may be
widened as educa- tion grows.</p>
<p>A revolution akin to that of the Renaissance has come to Chinese
litera- ture and philosophy. The importation of Western texts has had
the fer- tilizing infl uence that Greek manuscripts had upon the Italian
mind. And just as Italy, in her awakening, abandoned Latin to write in
the vernacular, so China, under the leadership of the brilliant Hu Shih,
has turned the popular “Mandarin” dialect into a literary language, the
Pat Hua. Hu</p>

John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was opened to medical students of either sex.

maintains nineteen hospitals, three medical schools, and sixty- five
scholarships.”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 8 3 1</p>
<p>Shih took his literary fate in his hands by writing in this “plain
language” a History of Chinese Philosophy (1919). His courage carried
the day; half a thousand periodicals adopted Pai Hua, and it was made
the official written language of the schools. Meanwhile the “Thousand
Character</p>
<p>Under the stimulus of a popular language and an eager people, litera-
ture flourishes. Novels, poems, histories and plays become almost as
numerous as the population. Newspapers and periodicals cover the land.
The literature of the West is being translated en masse, and American
motion pictures, expounded by a Chinese interpreter at the side of the
screen, are delighting the profound and simple Chinese soul. Philosophy
has returned to the great heretics of the past, has given them a new
hearing and exposition, and has taken on all the vigor and radicalism of
European thought in the sixteenth century. And as Italy, newly freed
from ecclesiastical leading-strings, admired the secularism of the Greek
mind, so the new China listens with especial eagerness to Western think-
ers like John Dewey and Bertrand Russell, whose independence of all
theology and respect for experience and experiment as the only logic,
accord completely with the mood of a nation that is trying to have its
Reformation, Renaissance, Enlightenment and Revolution in one gen-
eration.* Hu Shih scorns our praise of the “spiritual values” of Asia,
and finds more spiritual worth in the reorganization of industry and
govern- ment for the elimination of poverty than in all the “wisdom of
the East.”” He describes Confucius as “a very old man,” and suggests
that a better</p>

movement, the ac - ceptance of Western models in mind and morals has

and China is tending to join with Japan in a revolt against European and

<p>cient sanity to see the value even of old men, and he has formulated
the problem of his country perfectly:</p>
<p>It would surely be a great loss to mankind at large if the accep-</p>
<p>tance of this new civilization should take the form of abrupt
dis-</p>
<p>placement instead of organic assimilation, thereby causing the
dis-</p>
<p>appearance of the old civilization. The real problem, therefore, may
be restated thus: How can we best assimilate modern civilization in</p>
<p>such a manner as to make it congenial and congruous and continu-</p>
<p>ous with the civilization of our own making? 1 “</p>
<p>All the surface conditions of China today tempt the observer to con-
clude that China will not solve the problem. When one contemplates the
desolation of China’s fields, blighted with dro ught or ruined with
floods, the waste of her timber, the stupor of her exhausted peasants,
the high mortality of her children, the unnerving toil of her
factory-slaves, the disease-ridden slums and tax-ridden homes of her
cities, her bribe-in- fested commerce and her foreign-dominated
industry, the corruption of her government, the weakness of her defenses
and the bitter factionalism of her people, one wonders for a moment
whether China can ever be great again, whether she can once more consume
her conquerors and live her own creative life. But under the surface, if
we care to look, we may see the factors of convalescence and renewal.
This soil, so vast in extent and so varied in form, is rich in the
minerals that make a country indus- trially great; not as rich as
Richtofen supposed, but almost certainly richer than the tentative
surveys of our ’day have revealed; as industry moves inland it will come
upon ores and fuels as unsuspected now as the mineral and fuel wealth of
America was undreamed of a century ago. This</p>
<p>nation, after three thousand years of grandeur and decay, of repeated
deaths and resurrections, exhibits today all the physical and mental
vital- ity that we find in its most creative periods; there is no people
in the world more vigorous or more intelligent, no other people so
adaptable to circumstance, so resistant to disease, so resilient after
disaster and suf- fering, so trained by history to calm endurance and
patient recovery. Imagination cannot describe the possibilities of a
civilization mingling the physical, labor and mental resources of such a
people with the tech- nological equipment of modern industry. Very
probably such wealth will be produced in China as even America has never
known, and once again,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) REVOLUTION AND RENEWAL 823</p>
<p>as so often in the past, China will lead the world in luxury and the
art of life.</p>
<p>No victory of arms, or tyranny of alien finance, can long suppress
a</p>
<p>nation so rich in resources and vitality. The invader will lose funds
or patience before the loins of China will lose virility; within a
century</p>
<p>China will have absorbed and civilized her conquerors, and will have
learned all the technique of what transiently bears the name of modern
industry; roads and communications will give her unity, economy and
thrift will give her funds, and a strong government will give her order
and peace. Every chaos is a transition. In the end disorder cures and
balances itself with dictatorship; old obstacles are roughly cleared
away, and fresh growth is free. Revolution, like death and style, is the
removal of rubbish, the surgery of the superfluous; it comes only when
there are many things ready to die. China has died many times before;
and many times she has been reborn.</p>
