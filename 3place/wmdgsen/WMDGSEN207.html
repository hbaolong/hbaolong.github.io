<h4 id="chapter-xxiii">CHAPTER XXIII</h4>
<p>Roman Greece</p>
<p>I. PLUTARCH</p>
<p>R OME tried hard to be generous to Greece and did not quite fail. No
.garrisons were placed in the new province of Achaea; less was exacted
from it than its own taxgatherers had claimed before; the city-states
were allowed to govern themselves by their old constitutions and laws;
and many of them — Athens, Sparta, Plataea, Delphi, and others — were
“free cities” exempt from all restrictions except the right to wage
foreign or class war.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hungry for its ancient liberties, and bled by Roman
generals, moneylenders, and businessmen skilled in buying cheap and
selling dear, Greece joined in Mithridates’ revolt and paid the heaviest
penalty. Athens suffered a devastating siege, and Delphi, Elis, and
Epidaurus were pillaged of their sanctuary hoards. A generation later
Caesar and Pompey, then An- tony and Brutus, fought their duels on Greek
territory, conscripted Greek men, requisi tioned Greek crops and gold,
levied twenty years’ taxes in two, and left the cities destitute. Under
Augustus Greek Asia recovered, but Greece herself remained poor, ruined
not so much by the Roman conquest as by a stifling despotism in Sparta,
a chaotic freedom in Athens, a blighting sterility in soil and men. Her
most enterprising sons deserted her for younger and richer lands. The
rise of new powers in Egypt, Carthage, and Rome, and the development of
industry in the Hellenistic East, left the homeland of the classic
spirit outmoded and forlorn. Rome loaded Greece with compliments and
ravaged her art: Scaurus took 3000 statues for his theater, Caligula or-
dered the husband of his mistress to comb Greece for statuary, and Nero
alone took half the sculptures of Delphi. Not till Hadrian would Athens
smile again.</p>
<p>Epirus bore the brunt of Rome’s anger in the Macedonian Wars; the
Senate</p>

<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP, xxm)</p>
<p>chief cities of the province — Edessa, Pella, and Thessalonica. This
last — known to us as Salonika, but to modern Greeks by its ancient name
(Victory of Thes- saly) — was the capital of the province, seat of the
provincial council, and one of the great ports of trade between the
Balkans and Asia. Thrace, farther east, de- voted itself to agriculture,
herding, and mining; but it had considerable cities at Serdica (Sofia),
Philippopolis its capital, Adrianople, Perinthus, and Byzantium
(Istanbul). Here at the Golden Horn the merchants and fishmongers grew
rich while the Greek settlers of the hinterland gave way to the
encroaching bar- barians; all the grain of the interior came down to its
docks, all the commerce of Scythia and the Black Sea paid toll as it
passed by, and the fish almost leaped into the net as they poured
through the narrow Bosporus. Soon Constantine would recognize this site
as the key city of the classic world.</p>
<p>Thessaly, south of Macedonia, specialized in wheat and fine horses.
Euboea, the great island named of old (like Boeotia) for its fine
cattle, was described by Dio Chrysostom 1 as reverting to barbarism in
our second century; here, above all, the discouragement of the poor by
the concentration of land and wealth in the hands of a few families, the
discouragement of the rich by ever-rising taxes and liturgies, and the
discouragement of parentage by selfish wealth and desperate poverty had
almost wiped out a once thriving agricultural population, and cattle
grazed within the walls of Chalcis and Eretria. Boeotia had not
recovered from the death and taxes laid upon it by Sulla’s campaigns;
“Thebes,” said Strabo, “is only a village,” huddled into what had once
been merely its Cadmea or citadel. A century of peace, however, brought
some prosperity to Plataea; and Chaeronea, on whose plains Philip and
Sulla had won empires, retained enough charm to keep its most famous
citizen; it had become so small, said Plutarch, that he would not make
it smaller by leaving it. 2 In his calm career and genial thought we
find a fairer side of a somber scene, a decent middle class clinging to
ancient virtues, capable of civic devotion, warm friendship, and
parental love. There is no more pleasant character in our tale than
Plutarch of Chaeronea.</p>
<p>He was bom there about a.d. 46, and died there about 126. He was a
student at Athens when Nero collected triumphs in Greece. He must have
had a fair income, for he traveled in Egypt and Asia Minor and twice in
Italy; he lectured in Greek at Rome and seems to have served his country
in some diplomatic role. He liked the great capital and the good manners
and honorable life of its new aristocracy; he admired their stoic code,
and agreed with Ennius that Rome had been made by morality and
character. As he contemplated these living nobles and the noble dead,
the thought came to him of comparing the heroes of Rome with those of
Greece. He proposed not merely to write history or even biography, but
to teach virtue and hero- ism by historic exemplars; even his Parallel
Lives were in his mind Moralia . He was always a teacher and never lost
a chance to tie a moral to a tale; but who has ever done it more
gracefully? He warns us, in his “Alexander,” that</p>
<p>484 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>he is more interested in character than in history; he hopes that by
pairing and comparing great Romans with great Greeks he will pass on
some moral stimulus, some heroic impulse, to his readers. With disarming
candor he confesses that he himself has become a better man through
keeping company so long with distinguished men. 3</p>
<p>We must not expect to find in him the conscience and accuracy of a
proper historian; he is rich in errors of name and place and date and
occasionally (if we may judge) misunderstands events; he even fails in
two major tasks of the biographer — to show the derivation of his
subject’s character and work from heredity, environment, and
circumstance, and the development of character through growth,
responsibility, and crisis; in Plutarch, as in Heracleitus, a man’s
character is his fate. But no one who has read the Lives can feel their
shortcomings; these are lost in the vivid narrative, the exciting
episodes, the fascinating anecdotes, the wise comments, the noble style.
In all these 1500 pages there is not a line of padding; every sentence
counts. A hundred eminent men — generals, poets, and philosophers — have
borne witness to the book; “it is,” said Mmc Roland, “the pasture of
great souls.” 4 “I can hardly do without Plutarch,” wrote Montaigne; “it
is my breviary.” 6 Shakespeare takes many stories here, and his view of
Brutus goes back through Plutarch to Roman aristocrats. Napoleon carried
the Lives with him almost every- where; and Heine, reading them, could
hardly restrain himself from leaping upon a horse and riding forth to
conquer France. Greece has not left us a more precious book.</p>
<p>Having seen the Mediterranean world Plutarch returned to Chaeronea,
raised four sons and a daughter, lectured and wrote, journeyed now and
then to Athens, but for the most part shared to the end of his days the
simple life of his native town. He thought it an obligation to combine
public office with his scholarly pursuits. His fellow citizens elected
him building inspector, then chief magistrate, then Boeotarch — member
of the national council. He pre- sided over municipal ceremonies and
festivals, and became in his spare mo- ments a priest of the revived
oracle at Delphi. He thought it unwise to reject the old faith because
of its intellectual incredibility; the vital thing was not the creed but
the support it gave to man’s weak morality, the reinforcing bond it wove
among the members and generations of a family and a state. The thrill of
religious emotion was in his judgment the most deepening ex- perience of
life. Tolerant as well as pious, he almost founded the study of
comparative religion by his treatises on Roman and Egyptian cults. 6 All
deities, he argued, are aspects of one supreme being, timeless,
indescribable, so far removed from earthly and temporal affairs that
intermediary spirits ( daimones ) must create and regulate the world.
There are also evil spirits, marshaled by some master demon who is the
source and soul of all the chaos,</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>irrationality, and viciousness in nature and man. It is good,
Plutarch thought, to believe in personal immortality — a rewarding
Heaven, a cleansing Purga- tory, a punishing Hell; he was comforted by
the possibility that a stay in Purgatory might purify even Nero, and
that only a few would suffer eternal damnation. 7 He denounced the
terrors of superstition as worse than atheism, but he accepted
divination, oracles, necromancy, and the prophetic power of dreams. He
did not pretend to be an original philosopher; like Apuleius and so many
others of that age, he described himself as an adapter of Plato. He
condemned the Epicureans for replacing the fear of Hell with the gloom
of annihilation, and criticized the “repugnances” of Stoicism; bu t he
held, like a Stoic, that “to follow God and to obey reason are the same
thing.” 8 His lectures and essays have properly been collected under the
title Moralia, for most of them are simple and genial preachments on the
wisdom of life. They discuss everything, from the advisability of
keeping old men in public office to the priority of the chicken or the
egg. Plutarch is fond of his library, but confesses that good health is
more precious than good books:</p>
<p>Some men, led by gluttony, rush off to join in drinking bouts, as</p>
<p>if they were laying in provisions for a siege. . . . The less
expensive</p>
<p>foods are always more helpful. . . . When, in a precipitate
retreat,</p>
<p>Artaxerxes Memnon had nothing to eat but barley-bread and figs, he
exclaimed, “What a pleasure is this, which has never been mine be-
fore!” . . . Wine is the most beneficial of beverages, provided
there</p>
<p>is a happy combination of it with the occasion as well as with
water.</p>
<p>. . . Especially to be feared are indigestions arising from meats,
for</p>
<p>they are depressing at the outset, and a pernicious residue from them
remains behind. It is best to accustom the body not to require meat in
addition to other food. For the earth yields in abundance many</p>
<p>things not only for nourishment but for comfort and enjoyment. But
since custom has become a sort of unnatural second nature, our use of
meat should be … as a prop and support of our diet; we should</p>
<p>use other foods . . . more in accord with nature, and less dulling
to</p>
<p>the reasoning faculty, which, as it were, is kindled from plain
and</p>
<p>light substances . 0</p>
<p>He follows Plato in advocating equal opportunity for women, and gives
many examples of cultured ladies in antiquity (there were some in his
own circle) ; but he views adultery by the man with all the lenience of
a pagan male:</p>
<p>If a man in private life, who is incontinent and dissolute in
regard</p>
<p>to his pleasures, commit some peccadillo with a paramour or maid-</p>
<p>servant, his wedded wife ought not to be indignant or angry, but</p>
<p>she should reason that it is respect for her that leads him to share
his licentiousness with another woman . 10</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we rise from these charming essays warmed by the
fellow- ship of a man humane, essentially wholesome, and complete. We
are not offended by the commonness of his ideas; his moderation is a
welcome anti- dote to the ideological hysteria of our time; his good
sense, his kindly humor, and his engaging illustrations carry us on
unresisting, even over the shoals of his platitudes. It is refreshing to
find a philosopher who is wise enough to be happy. Let us be thankful,
he counsels us, for the common boons and graces of life, and feel them
none the less gladly for their permanence:</p>
<p>We must not forget those blessings and comforts which we share</p>
<p>with many more, but must . . . joy in this, that we live, that we
have our health, that we behold the light of the sun. . . . Will not
the</p>
<p>good man consider every day a festival? . . . For the world is
the</p>
<p>most august of temples, and most worthy of its Lord. Into this temple
man is introduced at his birth, into the presence not of statues made
with hands and motionless, but such as the Divine Mind has mani-</p>
<p>fested to our senses . . . even the sun, moon, and stars, and the</p>
<p>rivers ever pouring forth fresh water, and the earth producing</p>
<p>food. … As this life is the most perfect of initiations into the</p>
<p>most exalted of mysteries, we should ever be filled with good cheer
and rejoicing. 11</p>

<p>Plutarch exemplifies two movements of his time: the return to
religion and the passing renaissance of Greek literature and philosophy.
The former was universal, the latter was confined to Athens and the
Greek East. Six cities of the Peloponnesus prospered, but contributed
little to Greek thought. Western commerce and a busy textile industry
kept Patrae alive through Roman and medieval history even to our day.
Olympia throve on the leavings of tourists coming to see Pheidias’ “Zeus
or the Olympic games. It is one of the pleasantest aspects of Greek
history that these quadrennial contests continued from 77 6 b.c. to a.d.
394, when Theodosius ended them. As in the days of Prodicus and
Herodotus, philosophers and historians came to harangue the crowd
assembling for the festival. Dio Chrysostom describes authors reading
“their stupid compositions” to transient listeners, poets reciting their
verses, rhetoricians thumping the air, and “sophists in great number,
like gorgeous peacocks,” com ing to blow their wind over the multitude;
13 he proved no more silent than the rest. Epictetus pictures the
spectators cramped and sweltering in the unshaded stands, burned by the
sun or drenched by the rain, but forgetting everything in the tumult and
the shouting that marked the final moments of each bout or race. 13 The
old Nemean, Isthmian, Pyth-</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>ian, and Panathenaic games continued; new ones were added like the
Pan- hellenia of Hadrian; and many of them included competitions in
poetry, oratory, or music. “Can you not hear classical music at the
great festivals?” asks a character in Lucian . 14 Gladiatorial combats
were introduced to Greece by the Roman colony at Corinth; thence they
spread to other cities until even the Theater of Dionysus was befouled
with butchery. Many Greeks — Dio Chrysostom, Lucian, Plutarch —
protested against the desecra- tion; Demonax, the Cynic philosopher,
begged the Athenians not to allow the innovation until they had thrown
down the altar of Pity at Athens ; 18 but the Roman games continued in
Greece till predominantly Christian times.</p>
<p>Sparta and Argos were still moderately alive, and Epidaurus grew rich
on the visits of sick bodies and souls to the shrine of Asclepius.
Corinth, control- ling the trade across the isthmus, became, within half
a century of its re- establishment by Caesar, the wealthiest city in
Greece. Its heterogeneous population of Romans, Greeks, Syrians, Jews,
and Egyptians, most of them uprooted from their native lands and morals,
was notorious for commercial- ism, epicureanism, and immorality. The old
Temple of Aphrodite Pandemos carried on an undkninished trade as the
shrine and center of Corinthian pros- titutes. Apuleius describes a
gorgeous ballet that he saw in Corinth, represent- ing the judgment of
Paris. “Venus appeared all naked, save that her fine and comely middle
was lightly covered with a thin silken smock; and this the wanton wind
blew hither and thither .” 18 Corinth had not m ended her ways since
Aspasia.</p>
<p>Passing through Megara into Attica, the rural scene was one of great
poverty. Deforestation, erosion, and mineral depletion had been added to
war, emigration, taxation, and race suicide to make a desert of the
Roman peace. Two cities alone in Attica were prosperous: Eleusis, whose
sacra- mental Mysteries drew lucrative crowds to her every year; and
Athens, the educational and intellectual center of the classic world.
Its ancient institu- tions — council, assembly, and archons — still
functioned, and Rome had re- stored the Areopagus to its primeval
authority as the seat of judgment and the citadel of property rights.
Rulers like Antiochus IV, Herod the Great, Augustus, and Hadrian rivaled
millionaires like Herodes Atticusin benefac- tions to the city. Herodes
rebuilt the stadium in marble, almost exhausting Pentelicus, and raised
an odeon, or music hall, at the foot of the Acropolis. Hadrian provided
funds to complete the Olympieum, and Zeus, who now had one foot in the
grave, received a home worthy of his Casanova prime. Meanwhile the
unrivaled fame of Athens in letters, philosophy, and educa- tion brought
a stream of rich youths and needy scholars to her schools. The
University of Athens consisted of ten professorships endowed by the city
or</p>
<p>488 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>the emperor, and a host of private lecturers and tutors. Instruction
was given in literature, philology, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics,
astronomy, medi- cine, and law — usually in gymnasia or theaters,
sometimes in temples or homes. Except in oratory or law the curriculum
had no thought of equipping the student to earn a living; it sought
rather to sharpen his mind, deepen his understanding, and provide him
with a moral code. It produced many bril- liant intellects, but also it
generated thousands of cobweb-spinners who would turn both philosophy
and religion into a maze of controversial theories.</p>
<p>As Athens depended for a considerable part of its income on the
students, it put up patiently with their hilarious ways. “Freshmen” were
hazed with practical jokes that sometimes injured citizens; the students
of rival profes- sors became ardent partisans and attacked one another
in occasional riots like the “cane rushes” of ou r youth. Some students
felt that they could learn more from the courtesans and gamblers of the
town than from all teachers of philosophy; and we gather from AJciphron
that the ladies in question looked upon the professors as dull and
incompetent competitors. 17 But there was often a pleasant bond of
friendship between learners and teachers; many of these invited students
to dinner, guided their reading, visited them in illness, and kept their
parents misinformed about their progress. Most of the lec- turers lived
on fees paid by each disciple; a small number of professors drew a
salary from the state; and the heads of the four schools of philosophy
re- ceived 10,000 drachmas (000) a year from the imperial Treasury.</p>
<p>Under these stimuli the period of the “Second Sophistic” developed— a
revival of the orator-philosopher passing from city to city as
honorariums might beckon, delivering addresses, teaching pupils,
pleading cases in the courts, living in rich homes as spiritual
counselors, and sometimes acting as honored emissaries of their
city-states. The movement flourished throughout the Empire, but
especially in the Greek world, in the first three centuries of our era;
philosophers were then, says Dio, as numerous as cobblers. 18 The new
sophists, like the old, had no common doctrine, phrased their teaching
eloquently, drew large audiences, and attained in many cases high social
status, imperial favor, or great wealth. They differed from the earlier
Soph- ists in seldom questioning religion or morality; they were more
interested in form and style, in oratorical technique and skill, than in
the great questions that had shaken the beliefs and morals of the world;
indeed, the new sophists were warm defenders of the ancient faith.
Philostratus has preserved for us the lives of the leading sophists of
this age; let one example suffice. Adrian of Tyre studied rhetoric at
Athens and rose to the state chair of rhetoric there; he opened his
inaugural address with the proud words, “Once again le tters have come
from Phoenicia.” He rode to his lectures in a carriage with silver</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>harness, in rich attire, and gleaming with gems. When Marcus Aurelius
visited Athens he tested Adrian by asking him to improvise an oration on
a difficult theme; Adrian carried the matter off so well that Marcus
loaded him with honors, silver and gold, houses and slaves. Promoted to
the chair of rhetoric at Rome, Adrian’s lectures, though in Greek,
proved so alluring that senators adjourned their sessions, and the
populace deserted the panto- mimes, to go and hear him. 10 Such a career
almost announces the death of philosophy; it had been swallowed up in an
ocean of rhetoric, and had ceased to think when it learned to speak.</p>
<p>At the other extreme were the Cynics. We have described them else-
where — their tattered cloak, their unkempt hair and beard, their wallet
and staff, their reduction of life to simplicities, sometimes
obscenities. They lived like mendicant friars, had a hierarchical
organization with novices and su- periors, 20 avoided marriage and work,
scorned the conventions and arti- ficialities of civilization, denounced
all governments as thieves and super- fluities, laughed at all oracles,
“mysteries,” and go ds. Everyone satirized them, Lucian most savagely;
yet even Lucian admired Demonax, a cultured Cynic who had abandoned his
wealth to live in philosophical poverty. He gave his century of life
(a.d. 50-150) to helping others, reconciling hostile individuals and
cities; and Athens, which ridiculed everything, respected him. Indicted
before an Athenian court for refusing to offer sacrifice to the gods, he
won acquittal by saying simply that the gods had no need of offer- ings,
and that religion consisted in kindness to all. When the Athenian as-
sembly was engaged in a quarrel of factions, his mere appearance
sufficed to quiet the dispute; whereupon he left without having uttered
a “foord. It was his custom, in old age, to enter any house uninvited
and eat and sleep there; and every home in Athens sought the honor. 21
Lucian speaks with less sympathy of Peregrinus, who tried Christianity,
abandoned it for the Cynic regimen, denounced Rome, called all Greece to
revolt, and astonished an assemblage at Olympia by making and lighting
his own funeral pyre, leap- ing into it, and allowing himself to be
consumed in the flames (a.d. 165). 22 In such scorn of wealth and life
the Cynics were paving a way for the monks of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>When Vespasian, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius established chairs of
philosophy at Athens they ignored the Cynics and the Skeptics, and
recog- nized only four schools of thought: the Platonic Academy, the
Aristotelian Lyceum, the Stoics, and the Epicureans. The Acad emy had
diluted Plato’s proud faith in reason into the universal doubt of
Carneades; but after the latter’s death the school reacted toward
orthodoxy, and Antiochus of As - calon, who taught Cicero at the Academy
(79 b.c.), returned to Plato’s con - ceptions of reason, immortality,
and God. The Lyceum was now devoting</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>490</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>itself to natural science in the tradition of Theophrastus, or to
pious com- mentaries on Aristotle’s works. The school of Epicurus was
decli ning in this religious age; few men dared profess its doctrines
without diplomatic reserva- tions. In most of Greek Asia the words
Epicurean, atheist, and Christian were synonyms expressive of horror and
desecration. 23</p>
<p>The dominant philosophy had long since been Stoicism. The rigorous
perfectionism of its early forms had been softened by Panaetius and
Posei- donius, both citizens of Rhodes. Returning to Athens after
Scipio’s death ( 1 29 b . c .), Panaetius, now head of the Stoa, defined
God as a material spirit or breath ( pneuma ) permeating all things,
appearing in plants as the power of growth, in animals as soul {psyche),
in man as reason (logos ) . His suc- cessors developed this vague
pantheism into a more definitely religious phi- losophy. The Stoic
theory of moral discipline moved closer to Cynic as- ceticism; and in
the second century a.d. Cynicism, as one observer put it, differed from
Stoicism only by a torn cloak. In Epictetus, as in Marcus Aurelius, we
see both movements advancing toward Christianity.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>EPICTETUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Epictetus was bom at Hierapolis in Phrygia about a.d. 50, a slave
woman’s son, and therefore himself a slave. He had little chance of
education, for he was passed from one owner and city to another, until
he found himself the property of Epaphroditus, a powerful freedman in
Nero’s court. He was of feeble health and lame, apparently through the
brutality of one of his mas- ters, but he lived the normal threescore
years and ten. Epaphroditus allowed him to attend the lectures of
Musonius Rufus and later freed him. Epictetus must himself have set up
as a teacher in Rome, for when Domitian banished the philosophers
Epictetus was among those who fled. He settled in Nicop- olis and drew
to his lectures there students from many parts. One was Arrian of
Nicomedia, later governor of Cappadocia; Arrian took down the words of
Epictetus, probably in shorthand, and published them as Diatribai — “rub
- bings” or copies— now on all lists of the world’s best books as the D
iscourses* It is no dull formal treatise, but a classic of simple speech
and bluff humor, intimately expressing a modest and kindly, yet sharp
and vigorous character. Epictetus applied his lusty sarcasms to himself
and others impartially, and gaily mocked his rough-and-tumble style. He
made no complaint when Demonax, hearing that the old bachelor counseled
marriage, sarcastically petitioned for his daughter’s hand; he excused
himself on the ground that teaching wisdom is as great a service as
begetti ng “two or three pug -nosed</p>
<p>• Arrian later issued an Enchetridion, or synoptic “Handbook” of
Epictetus.</p>

<p>children.” 24 In later years he took a wife to help him care for an
infant that</p>
<p>Epictetus, resembling Socrates in this as in so many other ways,
cared too little about physics or metaphysics to construct a system of
thought; his one subje ct and passion was the good life. “What do I
care,” he asks, “whether all existing things are composed of atoms … or
of fire and earth? Is it not enough to learn the true nature of good and
evil?” 25 Philosophy does not mean reading books about wisdom, it means
training oneself in the practice of wisdom. The essence of the matter is
that a man should so mold his life and conduct that his happiness shall
depend as little as possible upon external things. This does not require
a hermit’s solitude; on the contrary, “Epicure - ans and blackguards”
are to be condemned for detaching men from public service; the good man
will take his part in civic affairs. But he will accept with equanimity
all vicissitudes of fortune — poverty, bereavement, humilia- tio n,
pain, slavery, imprisonment, or death; he will know how to “endure and
renounce.”</p>
<p>Never say about anything, “I have lost it,” but only “I have
given</p>
<p>it back.” Is your child dead? It has been given back. Is your wife
dead?</p>
<p>She has been returned. “I have had my farm taken away.” Very well;
this, too, has been given back. So long as God gives it to you take</p>
<p>care of it as something not your own. . . . “Alas, that I should
be</p>
<p>lame in one leg!” Slave! do you then, because of one paltry leg,</p>
<p>blame the universe? Will you not make a free gift of it to the whole?
… I must go into exile: does anyone keep me from going with a</p>
<p>smile, serene? … “I will throw you into prison.” It is only my</p>
<p>body you imprison. I must die; must I then die complaining? . . .</p>
<p>These are the lessons that philosophy ought to rehearse, and
write</p>
<p>down daily, and practice. … A platform or a prison are places,
one</p>
<p>high, the other low; but your moral purpose can be kept the same in
either place . 27</p>
<p>The slave can be spiritually free, like Diogenes; the prisoner can be
free, like Socrates; the emperor can be a slave, like Nero . 28 Even
death is a minor incident in the good man’s life; he may advance its
coming if he finds that evil too heavily outweighs good ; 29 in any case
he will receive it calmly as part of the secret wisdom of Nature.</p>
<p>If heads of grain had feeling, ought they to pray that they
should</p>
<p>never be harvested? … I would have you know that it is a curse</p>
<p>never to die. . . . The ship goes down. What, then, am I to do?</p>
<p>Whatever I can … I drown without fear, neither shrinking nor</p>
<p>crying out against God, but recognizing that what is bom must

<p>gard yourself as but a single thread of all that go to make up

<p>garment . 31 . . . Seek not that the things which happen to you
should happen as you wish, but wish the things that happen to be as
they</p>
<p>are, and you will find tranquillity . 32</p>
<p>Though he often speaks of Nature as an impersonal force, Epictetus as
frequently infuses his conception with personality, intelligence, and
love. The atmosphere of religion pervading his age warms his philosophy
to a self- surrendering piety akin to that of the Stoic emperor who
would soon read him and echo his thought. He speaks with a fine
eloquence of the majestic order prevailing in time and space, and the
evidences of design in nature, but he proceeds to explain that “God has
created some animals to be eaten, others to serve in farming, others to
produce cheese.” 33 The human mind itself, he thinks, is so marvelous an
instrument that only a divine creator could have brought it into being;
indeed, so far as we possess reason we are parts of the World Reason. If
we could trace our ancestry back to the first man we should find him
begotten by God; God is therefore literally the father of us all, and
all men are brothers . 84</p>
<p>He who has once observed with understanding the administration</p>
<p>of the world, and has learned that the greatest and most comprehen-
sive community is the system 〔 systema , standing together〕 of men and
God, and that from God came the seeds whence all things, and</p>
<p>especially rational beings, spring — why should not that man call
him- self a citizen of the world . . . nay, a son of God? … If a man</p>
<p>could only subscribe heart and soul to this doctrine … I think he</p>
<p>would entertain no mean or ignoble thought in himself. . . . Bear</p>
<p>in mind, then, when you eat, who you are that eat, and whom you</p>
<p>are nourishing; when you cohabit with women, who you are that</p>
<p>do this. … You arc bearing God about with you, you poor wretch,</p>
<p>and know it not! 33</p>
<p>In a passage that Saint Paul might have written, Epictetus exhorts
his students not only to submit their wills trustingly to God’s, but to
be</p>
<p>the apostles of God among mankind:</p>
<p>God says, “Go and bear witness for me .” 30 . . . Think what it
is</p>
<p>to be able to say, “God has sent me into the world to be his
soldier</p>
<p>and witness, to tell men that their sorrows and fears are vain,
that</p>
<p>to a good man no evil can befall, whether he live or die. God
sends</p>
<p>me at one time here, at another time there; he disciplines me by</p>
<p>poverty and imprisonment, that I may be the better witness to him</p>
<p>among men. With such a ministry committed to me, can I any longer</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>care in what place I am, or who my companions are, or what they say
about me? Nay, rather, does not my whole nature strain after God,</p>
<p>his laws and commandments?” 37</p>
<p>As for himself, he is filled with awe and gratitude by the mystery
and splendor of things, and he intones to the Creator a pagan Magnificat
that is one of the supreme passages in the history of religion:</p>
<p>What language is adequate to praise all the works of Providence?</p>
<p>… If we had sense, ought we to be doing anything else, publicly</p>
<p>or privately, than hymning and praising the Deity, and rehearsing</p>
<p>his benefits? Ought we not, as we dig and plow and eat, to sing a</p>
<p>hymn of praise to God? . . . What then? — since most of you have</p>
<p>become blind, ought there not to be someone to fulfill this office
for you, and in behalf of all sing hymns of praise to God? 88</p>
<p>Though we have here no word for immortality, and can trace all these
ideas back to the Stoics and the Cynics, we find in these pages
remarkable parallels to many attitudes of early Christianity. Epictetus,
indeed, sometimes advances beyond Christianity: he denounces slavery,
condemns capital pun- ishment, and wishes to have criminals treated as
sick men . 39 He advocates a daily examination of conscience 40 and
announces a kind of Golden Rule: “What you shun to suffer, do not make
others suffer”; 41 and he adds: “If a man is reported to have spoken ill
of you, make no defense, but say, “He did not know the rest of my
faults, else he would not have mentioned only these.” 42 He advises men
to return good for evil , 43 and to “submit when re - viled”; 44 to fast
now and then and “abstain from the things you desire .” 45 Sometimes he
speaks of the body with the blasphemous contempt of an un- scoured
anchorite: “The body is of all things the most unpleasant and most foul.
… It is astonishing that we should love a thing to which we perform such
strange services every day. I fill this bag, and then I empty it; what
is more troublesome?” 40 There arc passages that breathe the piety of
Augustine and the eloquence of Newman: “Use me henceforward, O God, as
thou wilt; I am of one mind with thee. I am thine. I ask exemption from
nothing that seems good in thy sight. Where thou wilt, lead me; in what
raiment thou wilt, clothe me .” 47 And like Jesus he bids his disciples
take no care of the</p>
<p>To have God as our maker, father, and guardian — shall not this</p>
<p>suffice to keep us from grief and fear? And wherewithal shall I
be</p>
<p>fed, asks one, if I have nothing? But what shall we say of . . .
the</p>
<p>animals, every one of which is sufficient to itself, and lacks
neither</p>
<p>its own proper food nor that way of life which is appropriate to
it,</p>
<p>and in harmony with nature? 48</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Christians like Saint John Chrysostom and
Augustine lauded him, and that his Encheiridion was adopted, with minor
changes, as a rule and guide for the monastic life ? 46 Who knows but
that Epictetus had read in some form the sayings of Jesus and was,
without knowing it, a convert to Christianity?</p>

<li>LUCIAN AND THE SKEPTICS</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, in this final stage of Hellenistic culture, there were
skeptics who recalled all the doubts of Protagoras, and a Lucian who
laughed at belief with the insolence of Aristippus and almost Plato’s
charm. The school of Pyrrho was not dead; Aenesidemus of Cnossus
rephrased its denials in the Alexandria of our first century, by
propounding the famous “Ten Modes” ( tropoi ), or contradictions, that
made knowledge impossible.* To - wards the end of the second century
Sextus Empiricus, of unknown date or place, gave the skeptical
philosophy its final formulation in several destruc- tive volumes of
which three survive. Sextus takes all the world for his enemy; he
divides philosophers into diverse species and slays each breed in turn.
He writes with the vigor necessary to an executioner, the good order and
clarity characteristic of ancient philosophy, occasional sarcastic
humor, and much dreary chopping of logic.</p>
<p>To every argument, says Sextus, an equal argument can be opposed, so
that in the end there is nothing so superfluous as reasoning. Deduction
is un- trustworthy unless based upon complete induction; but complete
induction is impossible, for we can never tell when a “negative
instance” will turn up . 51</p>
<p>• Some of them: (i) The sense organs (c.g., eyes) of different an
imals, even of different men, vary in form and structure, and presumably
give diverse pictures of the world; how do we know which picture is
true? (2) The senses convey only a fraction of the object — e.g., a
limited range of colors, sounds, and smells; clearly the conception that
we form of the object is parrial and unreliable. (3) One sense sometimes
contradicts another. (4) Our physical and mental condition colors and
perhaps discolors our perceptions — awake or sleeping, youth or age,
motion or rest, hunger or satiety, hatred or love. (6) The appearance of
an object varies according to the condition of the surrounding media —
light, air, cold, heat, moisture, etc.; which appearance is “rear? (8)
Nothing is known by itself or absolutely, but only in relation to
something else, ta pros tu (10) An individual’s beliefs depend upon the
customs, religion, institutions, and laws amid which he was reared; no
individual can think objectively. 00</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>more complete agnostic than the agnostics, for he affirms that we
cannot know that we cannot know; agnosticism is a dogma. 66 But, he
consoles us, we do not need certainty. Probability is enough for all
practical purposes, and the suspension of judgment ( epoche , holding
back; aphasia, saying nothing) in philosophical questions, instead of
disturbing the mind, brings it a careless peace (ataraxia) . 68
Meanwhile, since nothing is certain, let us accept the conventions and
beliefs of our time and place, and modestly worship our ancient gods.
67</p>
<p>Lucian would have belonged to the Skeptic school if he had been so
un- wise as to fetter his judgment with a label. Like Voltaire, whom he
resembled in all but pity, he wrote philosophy so brilliantly that no
one supposed that he was writing philosophy. As if to show the spread of
Hellenism, he was born at Samosata, in distant Commagene; “I am a Syrian
from the Euphrates,” he said; his native tongue was Syriac, his blood
probably Semitic. 68 He was apprenticed to a sculptor, but deserted to a
rhetor. After a stay in Antioch practicing law he took to the road as a
“dependent scholar,” living by lec - turing, especially in Rome and
Gaul; then (a.d. 165) he settled down in Athens. In his later years he
was rescued from poverty by the pious but tolerant Marcus Aurelius, who
appointed the irreverent skeptic to an official post in Egypt. There, at
a date unknown, he died.</p>
<p>Time has preserved seventy- six of Lucian’s little books, and many of
them are as fresh and pertinent today as when he read them to friends
and audi- ences eighteen centuries ago. He tried his hand at a variety
of forms, until he found a congenial medium in the dialogue. His
Dialogues of the Hetairai were free enough to win a large audience. But
at least in his works he is more absorbed in the gods than in
courtesans; he is never through mishandling them. “When I was a boy,”
says his Menippus, “and heard the tales of Homer and Hesiod about the
gods — adulterous gods, rapacious gods, violent, litigious, incestuous
gods — I found it all quite proper and, indeed, was intensely in-
terested. When, however, I came to man’s estate I observed that the laws
flatly contradicted the poets, forbidding adultery and rapacity.”
Perplexed, Menippus went to the philosophers for an explanation; but
they were so busy refuting one another that they only confounded his
confusion. So he made himself wings, flew up to heaven, and examined
matters for himself. Zeus received him magnanimously and allowed him to
watch Olympus functioning. Zeus himself was listening to prayers as they
came up to him through “a row of openings with lids like well covers. …
Of those at</p>
<p>sea one prayed for a north, another for a south, wind. The farmer
asked for rain, the fuller for sun. . . . Zeus seemed puzzled; he did
not know which prayer to grant, and experienced a truly Academic
suspension of judgment, showing a reserve and equilibrium worthy of
Pyrrho himself.” 60 The great</p>
<p>49 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>god rejects some petitions, grants others, and then arranges the
day’s weather:</p>
<p>But Lucian was as skeptical of rhetoric and philosophy as of the old
reli- gion. In one of his Dialogues of the Dead Charon commands a
rhetorician, whom he is ferrying to the other world, to “strip off that
boundless length of sentences that is wrapped around you, and those
antitheses, and balanced clauses”— otherwise the boa t will surely sink
. 62 In “Hermotimus” a student enters with enthusiasm upon the study of
philosophy, hoping that it will give him some substitute for faith; but
he is shocked by the vanity and greed of the rival teachers, and is left
intellectually and morally naked by their mutual refutations;
henceforth, he concludes, “I shall turn aside from a phi - losopher as
from a mad dog.” 63 Lucian himself defines philosophy as an attempt to
“get an elevation from which you may see in every direction.” 64 From
such an elevation life seems to him a ridiculous confusion, a chaotic
chorus in which all the dancers move and shout each at his own
individual will, “until the impresario dismisses them one by one from
the stage.” 05 In “Charon” he paints a dark pi cture of the human scene
as witnessed by super- human eyes from some celestial peak: men plowing,
toiling, disputing, suing in the courts, lending at usury, cheating and
being cheated, running after gold or pleasure; over their heads a cloud
of hopes, fears, follies, and hates; over these the Fates spinning the
web of life for each human atom; one man is lifted high from the mass
and then has a resounding fall; and each in turn is drawn away by some
messenger of death. Charon observes two armies fight-</p>
<p>ROMAN GREECE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>ing in the Peloponnesus; “Fools!” he comments, “not to know that
though each of them should win a whole Peloponnesus he will get but a
bare foot of ground in the end.” 00 Lucian is as impartial as nature; he
satirizes the rich for their greed, the poor for their envy, the
philosophers for their cobwebs, the gods for their nonexistence. In the
end he concludes with Voltaire that one must cultivate his garden.
Menippus, finding Teiresias in the lower world, asks him, What is the
best life? The old prophet answers:</p>
<p>The life of the ordinary man is the best and most prudent choice.</p>
<p>Cease from the folly of metaphysical speculation and inquiry into</p>
<p>origins and ends; count all this clever logic as idle talk, and
pursue</p>
<p>one end alone — how you may do what your hand finds to do, and go
your way with never a passion and always a smile . 07</p>
<p>If we sum up Greek thought in the first two centuries of our era, we
find it, despite Lucian, overwhelmingly religious. Men had once lost
faith in faith and taken to logic; now they were losing faith in logic
and were flocking back to faith. Greek philosophy had completed the
circuit from primitive theology through the skepticism of the early
Sophists, the atheism of Democ- ritus, the reconciliatory blandishments
of Plato, the naturalism of Aristotle, and the pantheism of the Stoa
back to a philosophy of mysticism, submission, and piety. The Academy
had passed from the utilitarian myths of its founder through the
skepticism of Cameades to the learned devotion of Plutarch; soon it
would culminate in the heavenly visions of Plotinus. The scientific
achievements of Pythagoras were forgotten, but his notion of
reincarnation was having another life; Neo-Pythagoreans were exploring
the mysticism of number, were practicing a daily examination of
conscience, and were pray- ing that after a minimum of avatars they
might pass — if necessary through Purgatory — into a blessed union with
God . 68 Stoicism was ceasing to be the proud and scornful philosophy of
aristocrats, and had found its final and most eloquent voice in a slave;
its doctrine of a final conflagration of the world, its rejection of all
pleasures of the flesh, its humble surrender to the hidden will of God,
were preparing for the theology and ethics of Christian- ity. The
Oriental mood was capturing the European citadel.</p>
