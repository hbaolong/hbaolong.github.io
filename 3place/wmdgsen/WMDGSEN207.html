Manners</h4>
<p>of Christendom</p>
<p>7OO-I3OO</p>
<p>I. THE CHRISTIAN ETHIC</p>
<p>M AN in the jungle or hunting stage had to be greedy — to seek food
eagerly and gorge himself zealously — because, when food came, he could
not be sure when it would come again. He had to be sexually sensitive,
often promiscuous, because a high death rate compelled a high birth
rate; every woman had to be made a mother whenever possible, and the
function of the male was to be always in heat. He had to be pugnacious,
ever ready to fight for food or mate. Vices were once virtues,
indispensable to survival.</p>
<p>But when man found that the best means of survival, for individual as
well as species, was social organization, he expanded the hunting pack
into a sys- tem of social order in which the instincts once so useful in
the hunting stage had to be checked at every turn to make society
possible. Ethically every civilization is a balance and tension between
the jungle instincts of men and the inhibitions of a moral code. The
instincts without the inhibitions would end civilization; the
inhibitions without the instincts would end life. The problem of
morality is to adjust inhibitions to protect civilization without
enfeebling life.</p>
<p>In the task of moderating human violence, promiscuity, and greed,
certain instincts, chiefly social, took the lead, and provided a
biological basis for civilization. Parental love, in beast and man,
created the natural social order of the family, with its educative
discipline and mutual aid. Parental authority, half a pain of love and
half a joy of tyranny, transmitted a life-saving code of social conduct
to the individualistic child. The organized force wielded by chieftain,
baron, city, or state circumscribed and largely circumvented the
unorganized force of individuals. Love of approval bent the ego to the
will of the group. Custom and imitation guided the adolescent, now and
then, into ways sanctioned by the trial-and-error experience of the
race. Law frightened instinct with the specter of punishment. Conscience
tamed youth with the detritus of an endless stream of prohibitions.</p>
<p>The Church believed that these natural or secular sources of morality
could not suffice to control the impulses that preserve life in the
jungle but destroy</p>
<p>819</p>
<p>820</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXorder in a society. Those impulses are too strong to be deterred
by any human authority that cannot be everywhere at once with awesome
police. A moral code bitterly uncongenial to the flesh must bear the
seal of a supernatural origin if it is to be obeyed; it must carry a
divine sanction and prestige that will be respected by the soul in the
absence of any force, and in the most secret moments and coverts of
life. Even parental authority, so vital to moral and social order,
breaks down in the contest with primitive instincts unless it is
buttressed by religious belief inculcated in the child. To serve and
save a society, a religion must oppose to insistent instinct no
disputable man-made directives, but the undebatable, categorical
imperatives of God Himself. And those divine commandments (so sinful or
savage is man) must be supported not only by praise and honor bestowed
for obeying them, nor only by dis- grace and penalties imposed for
violating them, but also by the hope of heaven for unrequited virtue,
and the fear of hell for unpunished sin. The command- ments must come
not from Moses but from God.</p>
<p>The biological theory of primitive instincts unfitting man for
civilization was symbolized in Christian theology by the doctrine of
original sin. Like the Hindu conception of karma, this was an attempt to
explain apparently unmerited suffering: the good endured evil here
because of some ancestral sin. In Christian theory the whole human race
had been tainted by the sin of Adam and Eve. Said Gratian’s Decretum (
c. 1 1 50), unofficially accepted by the Church as her teaching, “Every
human being who is conceived by the</p>
<p>Gregory I and later theologians spoke of seven deadly sins — pride,
avarice, envy, anger, lust, gluttony, and sloth; and opposed to them the
seven cardinal virtues: four “natural” or pagan virtue s praised by
Pythagoras and Plato — wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance; and
three “theological” virtues — faith, hope, and charity. But though
accepting the pagan virtues, Christi- anity never assimilated them. It
preferred faith to knowledge, patience to courage, love and mercy to
justice, abstention and purity to temperance. It exalted humility, and
ranked pride (so prominent in Aristotle’s ideal man) as the deadliest of
the Deadly Sins. It spoke occasionally of the rights of man, but it
stressed rather the duties of man — to himself, his fellow man, his
Church, and God. In preaching a “gentle Jesus meek and mild” the
Church</p>

<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>had no fear of making men effeminate; on the contrary, the men of
medieval Latin Christendom were more masculine — because they met more
hardships — than their modern beneficiaries and heirs. Theologies and
philosophies, like men and states, are what they are because in their
time and place they have to be.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PREMARITAL MORALITY</li>
</ol>
<p>How far did medieval morality reflect or justify medieval ethical
theory? Let us first look at the picture, with no thesis to prove.</p>
<p>The first moral incident of the Christian life was baptism: the child
was solemnly inducted into the community and the Church, and was
vicariously subjected to their laws. Every child received a “Christian
name”— that is, usually, the name of some Christian saint. Surnames
(i.e., added names) were of motley origin, and could go back through
generations to kinship, occupa- tion, place, a feature of body or
character, even a bit of church ritual: Cicely Wilkinsdoughter, James
Smith, Margaret Ferry woman, Matthew Paris, Ag- nes Redhead, John
Merriman, Robert Litany, Robert Benedicite or Bene- dict. 2</p>
<p>Gregory the Great, like Rousseau, urged mothers to nurse their own
in- fants; 3 most poor women did, most upper-class women did not. 4
Children were loved as now, but were beaten more. They were numerous,
despite high infantile and adolescent mortality; they disciplined one
another by their number, and became civilized by attrition. They learned
a hundred arts of the country or the city from relatives and playmates,
and grew rapidly in knowledge and wickedness. “Boys are taught evil as
soon as they can babble,” said Thomas of Celano in the thirteenth
century; “and as they grow up they become steadily worse until they are
Christians only in name” B — but moralists are bad historians. Boys
reached the age of work at twelve, and legal maturity at sixteen.</p>
<p>Christian ethics followed, with adolescents, a policy of silence
about sex: financial maturity — the ability to support a family — came
later than biological maturity — the ability to reproduce; sexual
education might aggravate the pains of continence in this interval; and
the Church required premarital con- tinence as an aid to conjugal
fidelity, social order, and public health. Never- theless, by the age of
sixteen the medieval youth had probably sampled a variety of sexual
experiences. Pederasty, which Christianity had effectively attacked in
late antiquity, reappeared with the Crusades, the influx of Orien- tal
ideas, and the unisexual isolation of monks and nuns.® In 1177 Henry,
Abbot of Clairvaux, wrote of France that “ancient Sodom is springing up
from her ashes.” 7 Philip the Fair charged that homosexual practices
were</p>
<p>822</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>an astonishing variety of beasts received such attentions. 8 Where
amours of this sort were discovered they were punishable with the death
of both par- ticipants; and the records of the English Parliament
contain many cases of dogs, goats, cows, pigs, and geese being burned to
death with their human paramours. Cases of incest were numerous.</p>
<p>Premarital and extramarital relations were apparently as widespread
as at any time between antiquity and the twentieth century; the
promiscuous na- ture of man overflowed the dikes of secular
ecclesiastical legislation; and some women felt that abdominal gaiety
could be atoned for by hebdomadal piety. Rape was common 9 despite the
severest penalties. Knights who served highborn dames or damoiselles for
a kiss or a touch of the hand might console themselves with the lady’s
maids; some ladies could not sleep with a good conscience until they had
arranged this courtesy. 10 The Knight of La Tour- Landry mourned the
prevalence of fornication among aristocratic youth; if we were to
believe him, some men of his class fornicated in church, nay, “on the
altar”; and he tells of “two queens which in Lent, on Holy Thursday…
took their foul delight and pleasance within the church during divine
serv- ice.” 11 William of Malmesbury described the Norman nobility as
“given over to gluttony and lechery,” and exchanging concubines with one
an - other 12 lest fidelity should dull the edge of husbandry.
Illegitimate children littered Christendom, and gave a plot to a
thousand tales. The heroes of sev- eral medieval sagas were bastards —
Cuchulain, Arthur, Gawain, Roland, William the Conqueror, and many a
knight in Froissart’s Chronicles.</p>
<p>Prostitution adjusted itself to the times. Some women on pilgrimage,
ac- cording to Bishop Boniface, earned their passage by selling
themselves in the towns on their route. 13 Every army was followed with
another army, as dangerous as the enemy. “The Crusaders,” reports Albert
of Aix, “had in their ranks a crowd of women wearing the habit of men;
they traveled to- gether without distinction of sex, trusting to the
chances of a frightful promiscuity.” 14 At the siege of Acre ( 1 189),
says the Arabic historian Em - ad- Eddin, “300 pretty Frenchwomen…
arrived for the sola ce of the French soldiers… for these would not go
into battle if they were deprived of women”; seeing which, the Moslem
armies demanded similar inspiration. 15 In the first crusade of
St. Louis, according to Joinville, his barons “set up their bro thels
about the royal tent.” 10 The university students, particularly at
Paris, developed urgent or imitative needs, and filles established
centers of accommodation. 17</p>
<p>Some towns — e.g., Toulouse, Avignon, Montpellier, Nuremberg —
legalized prostitution under municipal supervision, on the ground that
without such lupanars, bordelli, Frauenhauser, good women could not
venture safely into the streets. 18 St. Augustine had written: “If you
do away with harlots the world will be convulsed with lust”; 19 and
St. Thomas Aquinas agreed. 20 Lon- don in the twelfth century had a row
of “bordells” or “stews” near London</p>

<p>Bridge; originally licensed by the Bishop of Winchester, they were
subse- quently sanctioned by Parliament. 21 An act of Parliament in 1161
forbade the brothel keepers to have women suffering from the “perilous
infirmity of burning”— the earliest known regulation against the spread
of venereal dis- ease. 22 Louis IX, in 1254, decreed the banishment of
all prostitutes from France; the edict was ’enforced; soon a clandestine
promiscuity replaced the former open traffic; the bourgeois gentlemen
complained that it was well nigh impossible to guard the virtue of their
wives and daughters from the solicitations of soldiers and students; at
last criticism of the ordinance became so general that it was repealed (
1256). The new decree specified those parts of Paris in which
prostitutes might legally live and practice, regulated their dress and
ornaments, and submitted them to supervision by a police magis- trate
popularly known as the roi des ribauds, or king of the bawds, beggars,
and vagabonds. 23 Louis IX, dying, advised his son to renew the edict of
expul- sion; Philip did, with results much as before; the law remained
in the statutes, but was not enforced. 24 In Rome, according to Bishop
Durand II of Mende (1311), there were brothels near the Vatican, and the
pope’s marshals per - mitted them for a consideration. 23 The Church
showed a humane spirit toward prostitutes; she maintained asylums for
reformed women, and dis- tributed among the poor the donations received
from converted courtesans. 26</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MARRIAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Youth was brief, and marriage came early, in the Age of Faith. A
child of seven could consent to a betrothal, and such engagements were
sometimes made to facilitate the transfer or protection of property.
Grace de Saleby, aged four, was married to a great noble who could
preserve her rich estate; presently he died, and she was married at six
to another lord; at eleven she was married to a third. 27 Such unions
could be annulled at any time before the normal age of consummation,
which in the girl was presumed to be twelve, in the boy fourteen. 28 The
Church reckoned the consent of parents or guard- ian unnecessary for
valid marriage if the parties were of age. She forbade the marriage of
girls under fifteen, but allowed many exceptions; for in this matter the
rights of property overruled the whims of love, and marriage was an
incident in finance. The bridegroom presented gifts or money to the
girl’s parents, gave her a “morning gift,” and pledged her a dower right
in his estate; in England this was a life interest of the widow on one
third of the husband’s inheritance in land. The bride’s family gave
presents to the family of the groom, and assigned to her a dowry
consisting of clothing, linen, uten- sils, and furniture, and sometimes
of property. Engagement was an exchange of gages or pledges; the wedding
itself was a pledge (Anglo-Saxon iveddian, promise) ; the spouse was one
who had re-spo- nded “I will.”</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>824</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXState and Church alike accepted as valid marriage a consummated
union accompanied by the exchange of a verbal pledge between the
participants, without other ceremony legal or ecclesiastical. 29 The
Church sought in this way to protect women from abandonment by seducers,
and preferred such unions to fornication or concubinage; but after the
twelfth century she de- nied validity to marriages contracted without
ecclesiastical sanction; and after the Council of Trent (1563) she
required the presence of a priest. Secular law welcomed the
ecclesiastical regulation of marriage; Bracton (d. 1268) held a
religious ceremony essential to valid matrimony. The Church raised
marriage to a sacrament, and made it a sacred covenant between man,
woman, and God. Gradually she spread her jurisdiction over every phase
of marriage, from the duties of the nuptial bed to the last will and
testament of the dying spouse. Her canon law drew up a long list of
“impediments to matrimony.” Each party must be free from any previous
marriage bond, and from any vow of chastity. Marriage with an unbaptized
person was forbid- den; nevertheless there were many marriages between
Christian and Jew. 30 Marriage between slaves, between slave and free,
between orthodox Chris- tian and heretic, even between the faithful and
the excommunicate, was recognized as valid. 31 The parties must not be
related within the fourth de- gree of kinship — i.e., must not have an
identical ancestor within four genera- tions; here the Church rejected
Roman law and accepted the primitive exogamy that feared degeneration
from inbreeding; perhaps also she depre- cated the concentration of
wealth through narrow family alliances. In rural villages such
inbreeding was difficult to avoid, and the Church had to close her eyes
to it, as to many another gap between reality and law.</p>
<p>After the marriage ceremony came the wedding procession — with
blaring music and flaunting silk — from the church to the bridegroom’s
home. Festivi - ties would there ensue through all the day and half the
night. The marriage was not valid until consummated. Contraception was
forbidden; Aquinas accounted it a crime second only to homicide; 32
nevertheless diverse means- mechanical, chemical, magical — were used to
effect it, with chief reliance on coitus interruptus. 33 Drugs were
peddled that would produce abortion, or sterility, or impotence, or
sexual ardor; the penitential formulas of Rabanus Maurus decreed three
years of penance for “her who mixes the semen of her husband with her
food so that she may better receive his love.” 34 Infanticide was rare.
Christian charity established foundling hospitals in various cities from
the sixth century onward. A council at Rouen, in the eighth century,
invited women who had secretly borne children to deposit them at the
door of the church, which would undertake to provide for them; such
orphans were brought up as serfs on ecclesiastical properties. A law of
Charlemagne decreed that exposed children should be the slaves of those
who rescued and reared them. About 1 1 90 a Montpellier monk founded the
Fraternity of the Holy Ghost, dedicated to the protection and education
of orphans.</p>
<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>825</p>
<p>Penalties for adultery were severe; Saxon law, for example, condemned
the unfaithful wife at least to lose her nose and ears, and empowered
her husband to kill her. Adultery was common notwithstanding ; 35 least
so in the middle classes, most in the nobility. Feudal masters seduced
female serfs at the cost of a modest fine: he who “covered” a maid
“without her thanks”— against her will — paid the court three shillings.
38 The eleventh century, said Freeman, “was a profligate age,” and he
marveled at the apparent marital fidelity of William the Conqueror , 37
who could not say as much for his father. “Medie - val society,” said
the learned and judicious Thomas Wright, “was profoundly immoral and
licentious.” 38</p>
<p>The Church allowed separation for adultery, apostasy, or grave
cruelty; this was called divortium, but not in the sense of annulling
the marriage. Such annulment was granted only when the marriage could be
shown to have con- travened one of the canonical impediments to
matrimony. It is hardly prob- able that these were deliberately
multiplied to provide grounds of divorce for those who could afford the
substantial fees and costs required for an annulment. The Church used
these impediments to meet with flexible judg- ment exceptional cases
where divorce would promise an heir to a childless king, or would
otherwise serve public policy or peace. Germanic law allowed divorce for
adultery, sometimes even by mutual agreement. 39 The kings preferred the
laws of their ancestors to the stricter law of the Church; and feudal
lords and ladies, reverting to the ancient codes, sometimes divorced one
another without ecclesiastical leave. Not till Innocent III refused
divorce to Philip Augustus, the powerful King of France, was the Church
strong enough, in authority and conscience, to hew bravely to her own
decrees.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>WOMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>The theories of churchmen were generally hostile to woman; some laws
of the Church enhanced her subjection; many principles and practices of
Chris- tianity improved her status. To priests and theologians woman was
still in these centuries what she had seemed to Chrysostom — “a
necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic
peril, a deadly fascina- tion, a painted ill.” 40 She was still the
ubiquitous reincarnation of the Eve who had lost Eden for mankind, still
the favored instrument of Satan in lead-. ing men to hell. St. Thomas
Aquinas, usually the soul of kindness, but speak- ing with the
limitations of a monk, placed her in some ways below the slave:</p>
<p>The woman is subject to the man on account of the weakness of her
nature, both of mind and of body. 41… Man is the beginning of</p>
<p>woman and her end, just as God is the beginning and end of every</p>
<p>creature. 42… Woman is in subjection according to the law of nature,
but a slave is not. 43… Children ought to love their father more than
their mother. 44</p>
<p>8i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXCanon law gave to the husband the duty of protecting his wife, and
to the wife the duty of obeying her husband. Man, but not woman, was
made in the image of God; “it is plain from this,” argued the canonist,
“that wives should be subject to thei r husbands, and should almost be
servants.” 45 Such passages have the ring of wistful wishing. On the
other hand the Church en- forced monogamy, insisted upon a single
standard of morals for both sexes, honored woman in the worship of Mary,
and defended woman’s right to the inheritance of property.</p>
<p>Civil law was more hostile to her than canon law. Both codes
permitted wife-beating , 46 and it was quite a forward step when, in the
thirteenth cen- tury, the “Laws and Customs of Beauvais” bade a man beat
his wife “only in reason.” 47 Civil law ruled that the word of women
could not be admitted in court, “because of their frailty”; 48 it
required only half as high a fine for an offense against a woman as for
the same offense against a man ; 49 it excluded even the most high-born
ladies from representing their own estates in the Parliament of England
or the Estates-General of France. Marriage gave the husband full
authority over the use and usufruct of any property that his wife owned
at marriage / ’ 0 No woman could become a licensed physician.</p>
<p>Her economic life was as varied as the man’s. She learned and
practiced</p>
<p>As usual, despite theology and law, the medieval woman found ways

<p>annulling her disabilities with her charms. The literature of this
period is rich in records of women who ruled their men. 53 In several
respects woman was the acknowledged superior. Among the nobility she
learned something of letters and art and refinement, while her
letterless husband labored and fought. She could put on all the graces
of an eighteenth-century salonniere, and swoon like a Richardson
heroine; at the same time she rivaled man in lusty liberty of action and
speech, exchanged risque stories with him, and often took an unabashed
initiative in love. 54 In all classes she moved with full freedom seldom
chaperoned; she crowded the fairs and dominated the festi- vals; she
joined in pilgrimages, and took part in the Crusades, not only as a
solace but now and then as a soldier dressed in the panoply of war.
Timid monks tried to persuade themselves of her inferiority, but knights
fought for her favors, and poets professed themselves her slaves. Men
talked of her as an obedient servant, and dreamed of her as a goddess.
They prayed to Mary, but they would have been satisfied with Eleanor of
Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Eleanor was but one of a score of great medieval women — Galla
Placidia, Theodora, Irene, Anna Comnena, Matilda, Countess of Tuscany,
Matilda, Queen of England, Blanche of Navarre, Blanche of Castile,
Heloi’se…. Eleanor’s grandfat her was a prince and a poet, William X of
Aquitaine, patron and leader of the troubadours. To his court at
Bordeaux came the best wits and graces and gallants of southwestern
France; and in that court Elea- nor was reared to be a queen to life and
letters both. She absorbed all the culture and character of that free
and sunny clime: vigor of body and poetry of motion, passion of temper
and flesh, freedom of mind and manners and speech, lyric fantasies and
sparkling esprit , a boundless love of love and war and every pleasure,
even to the death. When she was fifteen (1137) the King of France
offered her his hand, anxious to add her duchy of Aquitaine, and the
great port of Bordeaux, to his revenues and his crown. She did not know
that Louis VII was a man stolid and devout, gravely absorbed in affairs
of state. She went to him gay and lovely and unscrupulous; he was not
charmed by her extravagance, and did not care for the poets who followed
her to Paris to reward her patronage with lauds and rhymes.</p>
<p>Hungry for a living romance, she resolved to accompany her husband to
Palestine on the Second Crusade (1147). She and her attendant ladies
donned male and martial costumes, sent their distaffs scornfully to
stay-at-home knights, and rode off in the van of the army, flying bright
banners and trail- ing troubadours. 55 Neglected or chided by the King,
she allowed herself, at Antioch and elsewhere, a few amours; rumor gave
her love now to her uncle Raymond of Poitiers, now to a handsome Saracen
slave, now (said ig- norant gossip) to the pious Saladin himself. 50
Louis bore these dalliances, and her keen tongue, patiently, but
St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the watchdog of Christendom, denounced her to
the world. In 1 152, suspecting that the King would divorce her, she
sued him for divorce on the ground that they w r ere</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXrelated in the sixth degree. The Church smiled at the pretext, but
granted the divorce; and Eleanor returned to Bordeaux, resuming her
title to Aqui- taine. There a swarm of suitors courted her; she chose
Henry Plantagenet, heir to the throne of England; two years later he was
Henry II, and Eleanor was again a queen ( 1 154) — “Queen of England,”
as she was to say, “by the wrath of God.”</p>
<p>To England she brought the tastes of the South; and she continued in
London to be the supreme lawgiver, patron, and idol of the trouveres and
troubadours. She was now old enough to bear fidelity, and Henry found no
scandal in her. But the tables were turned: Henry was eleven years her
jun- ior, quite her equal in temper and passion; soon he was spreading
his love among the ladies of the court; and Eleanor, who had once
scorned a jealous husband, fretted and fumed in jealousy. When Henry
deposed her, she fled from England, seeking the protection of Aquitaine;
he had her pursued, ar- rested, imprisoned; and for sixteen years she
languished in a confinement that never broke her will. The troubadours
roused the sentiment of Europe against the King; his sons, at her
behest, plotted to dethrone him, but he fought them off until his death
(1189). Richard Coeur de Lion succeeded his father, released his mother,
and made her regent of England while he crusaded against Saladin. When
her son John became king she retired to a convent in France, and died
there “through sorrow and anguish of mind,” at the age of eighty- two.
She had been “a bad wife, a bad mother, and a’ bad queen”; 87 but who
would think of her as belonging to a subject sex? V. PUBLIC MORALITY</p>
<p>In every age the laws and moral precepts of the nations have
struggled to discourage the inveterate dishonesty of mankind. In the
Middle Ages — not demonstrably more nor less than in other epochs — men,
good and bad, lied to their children, mates, congregations, enemies,
friends, governments, and God. Medieval man had a special fondness for
forging documents. He forged apocryphal gospels, perhaps never intending
them to be taken as more than pretty stories; he forged decretals as
weapons in ecclesiastical politics; loyal monks forged charters to win
royal grants for their monasteries; 88 Arch- bishop Lanfranc of
Canterbury, according to the papal Curia, forged a charter to prove the
antiquity of his see; 89 schoolmasters forged charters to e ndow some
colleges at Cambridge with a false antiquity; and “pious frauds”
corrupted texts and invented a thousand edifying miracles. Bribery was
gen- eral in education, trade, war, religion, government, law. 60
Schoolboys sent pies to their examiners; 61 politicians paid for
appointments to public office, and collected the necessary sums from
their friends; 62 witnesses could be bribed to swear to anything;
litigants gave presents to jurors and judges; 63</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) MORALS AND MANNERS 829</p>
<p>in 1289 Edward I of England had to dismiss most of his judges and
ministers for corruption. 64 The laws arranged for solemn oaths at every
turn; men swore on the Scriptures or the most sacred relics; sometimes
they were required to take an oath that they would keep the oath they
were about to take; 65 yet perjury was so frequent that trial by combat
was sometimes re- sorted to in the hope that God would identify the
greater liar. 66</p>
<p>Despite a thousand guild and municipal statutes and penalties,
medieval craftsmen often deceived purchasers with shoddy products, false
measures, and crafty substitutes. Some bakers stole small portions of
dough under their customers’ eyes by means of a trap door in the
kneading board; cheap cloths were secretly put in the place of better
cloths promised and paid for; in- ferior leather was “doctored” to look
like the best; 67 stones were concealed in sacks of hay or wool sold by
weight; 68 the meat packers of Norwich were accused of “buying measly
pigs, and making from t hem sausages and pud- dings unfit for human
bodies.” 69 Berthold of Regensburg ( c. 1220) described the different
forms of cheating used in the various trades, and the tricks played upon
country folk by merchants at the fairs. 70 Writers and preachers
condemned the pursuit of wealth, but a medieval German proverb said,
“All things obey money”; and some medieval moralists judged the lust for
gain stronger than the urge of sex. 71 Knightly honor was often real in
feudalism; but the thirteenth century was apparently as materialistic as
any epoch in history. These examples of chicanery are drawn from a great
area and time; though such instances were numerous they were presumably
exceptional; they do not warrant any larger conclusion than that men
were no better in the Age of Faith than in our age of doubt, and that in
all ages law and mo- rality have barely succeeded in maintaining social
order against the innate individualism of men never intended by nature
to be law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>Most states made grave theft a capital crime, and the Church
excommuni- cated brigands; even so, theft and robbery were common, from
pickpockets in the streets to robber barons on the Rhine. Hungry
mercenaries, fugitive criminals, ruined knights made roads unsafe; and
city streets after dark saw many a brawl, robbery, rape, and murder. 72
Coroners’ records from thirteenth- century Merrie England show “a
proportion of manslaughters which would be considered scandalous in
modern times”; 73 murders were almost twice as numerous as deaths by
accident; and the guilty were seldom caught. 74 The Church labored
patiently to repress feudal wars, but her mod- est measure of success
was won by diverting men and pugnacity to the Cru- sades, which were, in
one aspect, imperialistic wars for territory and trade. Once at war,
Christians were no gentler to the defeated, no more loyal to pledges and
treaties, than the warriors of other faiths and times.</p>
<p>Cruelty and brutality were apparently more frequent in the Middle
Ages than in any civilization before our own. The barbarians did not at
once cease to be barbarians when they became Christians. Noble lords and
ladies buf-</p>
<p>830 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXfeted their servants, and one another. Criminal law was brutally
severe, but failed to suppress brutality and crime. The wheel, the
caldron of burning oil, the stake, burning alive, flaying, tearing the
limbs apart with wild ani - mals, were often used as penalties.
Anglo-Saxon law punished a female slave convicted of theft by making
each of eighty female slaves pay a fine, bring three faggots, and burn
her to death. 75 In the wars of central Italy in the late thirteenth
century, says the chronicle of the contemporary Italian monk Salimbene,
prisoners were treated with a barbarity that in our youth would have
been incredible:</p>
<p>For some men’s heads they bound with a cord and lever, and strained
it with such force that their eyes started from their sockets and
fell</p>
<p>upon their cheeks; others they bound by the right or left thumb only,
and thus lifted the whole weight of their bodies from the ground;</p>
<p>others again they racked with yet more foul and horrible torments</p>
<p>which I blush to relate; others… they would seat with hands bound
behind their backs, and laid under their feet a pot of live coals…
or</p>
<p>hey bound their hands and legs together round a spit (as a lamb
is</p>
<p>carried to the butcher), and kept them thus hanging all day long,</p>
<p>without food or drink; or again, with a rough piece of wood they</p>
<p>would rub and grate their shins until the bare bone appeared, which
was a misery and sore pity even to behold. 70</p>
<p>Medieval man bore suffering bravely, and perhaps with less
sensitivity than the men of Western Europe would show today. In all
classes men and women were hearty and sensual; their festivals were
feasts of drinking, gam- bling, dancing, and sexual relaxation; their
jokes were of a candor hardly rivaled today ; 77 their speech was freer,
their oaths vaster and more numer- ous. 78 Hardly a man in France, says
Joinville, could open his mouth without mentioning the Devil. 79 The
medieval stomach was stronger than ours, and bore without flinching the
most Rabelaisian details; the nuns in Chaucer listen unperturbed to the
scatology of the Miller ’s Tale; and the chronicle of the good monk
Salimbene is at times untranslatably physical. 80 Taverns were numerous,
and some, in modern style, supplied “tarts” with ale. 81 The Church
tried to close the taverns on Sundays, with small success. 82 Occa-
sional drunkenness was the prerogative of every class. A visitor to
Liibeck found some patrician ladies in a wine cellar, drinking hard
under their veils. 83 At Cologne there was a society that met to drink
wine, and took for its motto, Bibite cum hilaritate ; but it imposed
upon its members strict rules for moderation in conduct and modesty in
speech. 84</p>
<p>The medieval man, like any other, was a thoroughly human mixture of
lust and romance, humility and egotism, cruelty and tenderness, piety
and greed. Those same men and women who drank and cursed so heartily
were capable of touching kindnesses and a thousand charities. Cats and
dogs were pets then as now; dogs were trained to lead the blind ; 85 and
knights devel-</p>

<p>oped an attachment for their horses, falcons, and dogs. The
administration of charity reached new heights in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. Indi- viduals, guilds, governments, and the Church
shared in relieving the unfor- tunate. Almsgiving was universal. Men
hopeful of paradise left charitable bequests. Rich men dowered poor
girls, fed scores of the poor daily, and hundreds on major festivals. At
many baronial gates doles of food were dis- tributed thrice weekly to
all who asked. 86 Nearly every great lady felt it a social, if not a
moral, necessity, to share in the administration of charity. Roger
Bacon, in the thirteenth century, advocated a state fund for the relief
of poverty, sickness, and old age ; 87 but most of this work was left to
the Church. In one aspect the Church was a continent-wide organization
for charitable aid. Gregory the Great, Charlemagne, and others required
that one fourth of the tithes collected by any parish should be applied
to succor the poor and the infirm ; 88 it was so done for a time; but
the expropriation of parish revenues by lay and ecclesiastical superiors
disrupted this parochial administration in the twelfth century, and the
work fell more than ever upon bishops, monks, nuns, and popes. All nuns
but a few human sinners devoted themselves to education, nursing, and
charity; their ever-widening ministra- tions are among the brightest and
most heartening features of medieval and modem history. Monasteries,
supplied by gifts and alms and ecclesiastical revenues, fed the poor,
tended the sick, ransomed prisoners. Thousands of monks taught the
young, cared for orphans, or served in hospitals. The great abbey of
Cluny atoned for its wealth by an ample distribution of alms. The popes
did what they could to help the poor of Rome, and continued in their own
way the ancient imperial dole.</p>
<p>Despite all this charity, begging flourished. Hospitals and
almshouses tried to provide food and lodging for all applicants; soon
the gates were sur- rounded by the halt, the decrepit, the maimed, the
blind, and ragged vaga- bonds who went from “spital to spital, prowling
and poaching for lumps of bread and meat.” 89 Mendicancy reached in
medieval Christendom and Islam a scope and pertinacity unequaled today
except in the poorest areas of the Far East.</p>

<p>Who were the people of medieval Europe? We cannot divide them into
“races”; they were all of the “white race” except the Negro slaves. But
what a baffling unclassifiable variety of men! Greeks of Byzantium and
Hellas, the half-Greek Italians of southern Italy, the Greco-Moorish-
Jewish population of Sicily, the Romans, Umbrians, Tuscans, Lombards,
Genoese, Venetians of Italy — all so diverse that each at once betrayed
his origin by dress and coiffure and speech; the Berbers, Arabs, Jews,
and Christians of Spain; the Gascons, Provencals, Burgundians,
Parisians, Normans, of France; the</p>

Anglian,</p>
<p>Saxon, Danish, Norman stocks in England; the Celts of Wales, Ireland,
and Scotland; the Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes; the hundred tribes of
Ger- many; the Finns and Magyars and Bulgars; the Slavs of Poland,
Bohemia, the Baltic States, the Balkans, and Russia: here was such a
farrago of bloods and types and noses and beards and dress that no one
description could fit their proud diversity.</p>
<p>The Germans, by a millennium of migrations and conquests, had made
their type prevail in the upper classes of all Western Europe except
central and southern Italy, and Spain. The blond type was so definitely
admired in hair and eyes that St. Bernard struggled through an entire
sermon to rec- oncile with this preference the “I am black but
beautiful” of the Song of Songs. The ideal knight was to be tall and
blond and bearded; the ideal woman in epic and romance was slender and
graceful, with blue eyes and long blond or golden hair. The long hair of
the Franks gave place, in the upper classes of the ninth century, to
heads closely cropped in back, with only a cap of hair on the top; and
beards disappeared among the European gentry in the twelfth century. The
male peasantry, however, continued to wear long and unclean beards, and
hair so ample that it was sometimes gath- ered in braids. 00 In England
all classes kept long hair, and the male beaux of the thirteenth century
dyed their hair, curled it with irons, and bound it with ribbons. 91 In
the same land and century the married ladies tied up their hair in a net
of golden thread, while highborn lasses let it fall down their backs,
with sometimes a curl falling demurely over each shoulder upon the
breast. 92</p>
<p>The West Europeans of the Middle Ages were more abundantly and
attractively dressed than before or since; and the men often excelled
the women in splendor and color of costume. In the fifth century the
loose toga and tunic of the Roman fought a losing war with the breeches
and belt of the Gaul; the colder climate and military occupations of the
North required tighter and thicker clothing than had been suggested by
the warmth and ease of the South; and a revolution in dress followed the
transfer of power across the Alps. The common man wore close-fitting
pantaloons and tunic or blouse, both of leather or strong cloth; at the
belt hung knife, purse, keys, sometimes the worker’s tools; over the
shoulders was flung a cloak or cape; on the head a cap or hat of wool or
felt or skins; on the legs long stockings; and on the feet high leather
shoes curled up at the toe to forestall stubbing. Toward the end of the
Middle Ages the hose grew longer till they reached the hips and evolved
into the uncomfortable trousers that modem man has substituted, as a
perennial penance, for the hair shirt of the medieval saint. Nearly all
garments were of wool except some of skin or leather among peasants or
hunters; nearly all were spun, woven, cut, and sewed at home; but the
rich had professional tailors, known in England as “scissors.”

<p>occasionally used in antiquity, were avoided before the thirteenth
century, and then appeared as functionless ornaments; hence the phrase
“not worth</p>
<p>The rich embellished these basic garments in a hundred fancy ways.
Hems and necklines were trimmed with fur; silk, satin, or velvet
replaced linen or wool when the weather allowed; a velvet cap covered
the head, and shoes of colored cloth followed closely the form of the
feet. The finest furs came</p>
<p>from Russia; the choicest was ermine, made from white weasel; barons
were known to mortgage their lands to buy ermine for their wives. The
rich wore drawers of fine white linen; hose often colored, usually of
wool, sometimes of silk; a shirt of white linen, with flaunty collar and
cuffs; over this a tunic; and over all, in cold or rainy weather, a
mantle or cape or chaperon — a cape with a cowl that could be drawn up
over the head. Some caps were made with a flat square top; these
mortiers or “mortar - boards” were affected in the later Middle Ages by
lawyers and doctors, and survive in our college dignities. Dandies wore
gloves in any weather, and (complained the monk Ordericus Vitalis)
“swept the dusty ground with the prodigal trains of their mantles and
robes.” 94</p>
<p>Jewelry was displayed by men not only on the person but on the cloth-
ing-cap, robe, shoes. Some garments were embroidered with sacred or pro-
fane texts in pearls; 95 some were trimmed with gold or silver lace,
some wore cloth of gold. Kings had to distinguish themselves with extra
finery: Edward the Confessor wore a robe resplendently embroidered with
gold by his accomplished wife Edgitha, and Charles the Bold of Burgundy
wore a robe of state so thickly inlaid with precious stones that it was
valued at 200,000 ducats (,082,000). All but the poor wore rings; and
every man of any account had a signet ring bearing his personal seal; a
mark made with this seal was accepted as his personal signature.</p>
<p>Dress was an index of status or wealth; each class protested against
the imitation of its raiment by the class below it; and sumptuary laws
were vainly passed — as in France in 1294 and 1 306 — seeking to
regulate a citizen’s expenditure on wardrobe according to his fortune
and his class. The retain- ers, or dependent knights, of a great lord
wore, at formal functions, robes presented to them by him and dyed in
his favorite or distinctive color; such robes were called livery (
livree ) because the lord delivered them twice a year. Good medieval
garments, however, were made to last a lifetime, and some were carefully
bequeathed by will.</p>
<p>Wellborn ladies wore a long linen chemise; over this a fur-trimmed
pelisson or robe reaching to the feet; over this a bliaut or blouse worn
loose in disha- bille, but tightly laced against the coming of company;
for all fine ladies longed for slenderness. They might also wear jeweled
girdles, a silken purse, and chamois-skin gloves. Often they wore
flowers in their hair, or bound it</p>
<p>834 the age of faith (chap. </p>
<p>XXXwith fillets of jeweled silk. Some ladies aroused the clergy, and
doubtless worried their husbands, by wearing tall conical hats adorned
with horns; at one time a woman without horns was subject to unbearable
ridicule. 96 In the later Middle Ages high heels became the fashion.
Moralists complained that women found frequent occasions to raise their
robes an inch or two to show trim ankles and dainty shoes; female legs,
however, were a private and costly revelation. Dante denounced the
ladies of Florence for public decollete that “showed the bosom and the
breasts.” 97 The dress of ladies at tournaments furnished an exciting
topic for clergymen; and cardinals legis- lated on the length of women’s
robes. When the clergy decreed veils as vital to morality, the women
“caused their veils to be made of fine muslin and silk inwoven with
gold, wherein they showed ten times fairer than before, and drew
beholders’ eyes all the more to wantonness.” 98 The monk Guyot of
Provins complained that women used so much paint on their faces that
none was left to color the icons in the churches; he warned them that
when they w ore false hair, or applied poultices of mashed beans and
mares’ milk to their faces to improve their complexion, they were adding
centuries to their durance in purgatory. 99 Berthold of Regensburg,
about 1220, berated women with vain eloquence:</p>
<p>Ye women, ye have bowels of compassion, and ye go to church</p>
<p>more readily than the men… and many of you would be saved but for
this one snare:… in order that ye may compass men’s praise ye</p>
<p>spend all your labor on your garments Many of you pay as much</p>
<p>o the seamstress as the cost of the cloth itself; it must have
shields on the shoulders, it must be flounced and tucked all round the
hem. It is not enough for you to show your pride in your very
buttonholes; you must also send your feet to hell by special torments….
Ye busy your- selves with your veils: ye twitch them hither, ye twitch
them thither; ye gild them here and there with gold thread, and spend
thereon all your trouble. Ye will spend a good six months’ work on a
single veil,</p>
<p>which is sinful great travail — and all that men may praise your
dress:</p>
<p>“Ah, God! how fair! Was ever so fair a garment?” “How, Brother</p>
<p>Berthold” (you say), “we do it only for the goodman’s sake, that
he</p>
<p>may gaze the less on other women.” No, believe me, if thy goodman be
a good man indeed he would far rather behold thy chaste conversa- tion
than thy outward adorning…. Ye men might put an end to this, and fight
against it doughtily; first with good words; and if they are</p>
<p>still obdurate step valiantly in… tear it from her head, even though
four or ten hairs should come with it, and cast it into the fire! Do
thus not thrice or four times only; and presently she will forbear.
100</p>
<p>Sometimes the women took such preaching to heart, and — two centuries
be- fore Savonarola — cast their veils and ornaments into the fire. 101
Fortunately, such repentance was brief and rare.</p>

<p>MORALS AND MANNERS</p>
<p>835</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>IN THE HOME</li>
</ol>
<p>There was not much comfort in a medieval home. Windows were few, and
seldom glazed; wooden shutters closed them against glare or cold. Heat-
ing was by one or more fireplaces; drafts came in from a hundred cracks
in the walls, and made high-backed chairs a boon. In winter it was
common to wear warm hats and furs indoors. Furniture was scanty but well
made. Chairs were few, and usually had no backs; but sometimes they were
ele- gantly carved, engraved with armorial bearings, and inlaid with
precious stones. Most seats were cut into the masonry walls, or built
upon chests in alcoves. Carpets were unusual before the thirteenth
century. Italy and Spain had them; and when Eleanor of Castile went to
England in 1254 as the bride of the future Edward I, her servants
covered the floors of her apartment at Westminster with carpets after
the Spanish custom — which then spread through England. Ordinary floors
were strewn with rushes or straw, making some houses so malodorous that
the parish priest refused to visit them. Walls might be hung with
tapestries, partly as ornaments, partly to hinder drafts, partly to
divide the great hall of the house into smaller rooms. Homes in Italy
and Provence, still remembering Roman luxuries, were more comfortable
and sanitary than those of the North. The homes of German bourgeois, in
the thirteenth century, had water piped into the kitchen from wells.
102</p>
<p>Cleanliness, in the Middle Ages, was not next to godliness. Early
Chris- tianity had denounced the Roman baths as wells of perversion and
prom- iscuity, and its general disapproval of the body had put no
premium on hygiene. The modern use of the handkerchief was unknown. 103
Cleanliness was next to money, and varied with income; the feudal lord
and the rich bourgeois bathed with reasonable frequency, in large wooden
tubs; and in the twelfth century the spread of wealth spread personal
cleanliness. Many cities in Germany, France, and England had public
baths in the thirteenth century; one student reckons that Parisians
bathed more frequently in 1 292 than in the twentieth century. 104 One
result of the Crusades was the in- troduction into Europe of public
steam baths in the Moslem style. 105 The Church frowned upon public
baths as leading to immorality; and several of them justified her fears.
Some towns provided public mineral baths.</p>
<p>Monasteries, feudal castles, and rich homes had latrines, emptying
into cesspools, but most homes managed with outhouses; and in many cases
one outhouse had to serve a dozen homes. 106 Pipes for carrying off
waste were one of the sanitary reforms introduced into England under
Edward I (127 1 —</p>
<p>1307). In the thirteenth century the chamber pots of Paris were
freely emptied from windows into the street, with only a warning cry of
Gar ’ Feau! — such contretemps were a cliche of comedies as late as
Moliere. Public com- fort stations were a luxury; San Gimignano had some
in 1255, but Florence</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>836</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXas yet had none. 107 People eased themselves in courtyards, on
stairways and balconies, even in the palace of the Louvre. After a
pestilence in 1531 a de- cree ordered Parisian landlords to provide a
latrine for every house, but this ordinance was much honored in the
breach. 108</p>
<p>The upper and middle classes washed before and after meals, for most
eating was done with the fingers. There were but two regular meals
daily, one at ten, another at four; but either repast might last several
hours. In great houses the meal was announced by blasts on a hunting
horn. The dinner board might be rude planks on trestles, or a great
table strongly built of costly wood and admirably carved. Around it were
stools or benches — in French, bancs, whence banquet. In some French
homes ingenious machines raised or lowered into place, from a lower or
upper story, a full table ready served, and made it disappear in a
moment when the meal was finished. 109 Servants brought ewers of water
to each diner, who washed the hands therein and wiped them on napkins
which were then put away; in the thirteenth century no napkins were used
during the meal, but the diner wiped his hands on the tablecloth. 110
The company sat in couples, gentleman and lady paired; usually each
couple ate from one plate and drank from one cup. 111 Each person
received a spoon; forks were known in the thirteenth century, but seldom
provided; and the diner used his own knife. Cups, saucers, and plates
were normally of wood; 112 but the feudal aristocracy and the rich
bourgeoisie had dishes of earthenware or pewter, and some displayed
dinner sets of silver, even, here and there, of gold. 113 Dishes of cut
glass might be added, and a large silver vessel in the shape of a ship,
containing various spices, and the knife and spoon of the host. Instead
of a plate each couple received a large piece of bread, flat, round, and
thick; upon this tranchoir the diner placed the meat and bread that he
took with his fingers from the platters passed to him; when the meal was
over the “trencher” was eaten by the diner, or given to the dogs and
cats that swarmed around, or sent out to the neighboring poor. A great
meal was completed with spices and sweets and a final round of wine.</p>
<p>Food was abundant, varied, and well prepared, except that lack of
refrig- eration soon made meats high, and put a premium on spices that
could preserve or disguise. Some spices were imported from the Orient;
but as these were costly, other spices were grown in domestic gardens —
parsley, mustard, sage, savory, anise, garlic, dill…. Cookbooks were
numerous and complex; in a great establishment the cook was a man of
importance, bear- ing on his shoulders the dignity and reputation of the
house. He was equipped with a gleaming armory of copper caldrons,
kettles, and pans, and prided himself on serving dishes that would
please the eye as well as the palate. Meat, poultry, and eggs were

<p>grain bread of barley, oats, or rye, baked in their homes; city
dwellers preferred white bread — baked by bakers — as a mark of caste.
There were no potatoes, coffee, or tea; but nearly all meats and
vegetables now used in Europe — including eels, frogs, and snails — were
eaten by medieval man. 116 By the time of Charlemagne the European
acclimatization of Asiatic fruits and nuts was almost complete; oranges,
however, were still a rarity in the thirteenth century north of the Alps
and the Pyrenees. The commonest meat was pork. Pigs ate the refuse in
the streets, and people ate the pigs. It was widely believed that pork
caused leprosy, but this did not lessen the taste for it; great sausages
and black puddings were a medieval delight. Lordly hosts might have a
whole roast pig or boar brought to the table, and carve it before their
gaping guests; this was a delicacy almost as keenly relished as
partridges, quails, thrushes, peacocks, and cranes. Fish was a staple
food; herring was a main recourse of soldiers, sailors, and the poor.
Dairy products were less used than today, but the cheese of Brie was
already renowned. 117 Salads were unknown, and confections were rare.
Sugar was still an import, and had not yet replaced honey for
sweetening. Desserts were usually of fruits and nuts. Pastries were
innumerable; and jolly bakers, quite unreproved, gave cakes and buns the
most interesting shapes imaginable — quaedam pudenda muliebra, aliae
virilia. 118 It seems incredible that there was no after-dinner smoking.
Both sexes drank instead.</p>
<p>As unboiled water was seldom safe, all classes found substitutes for
it in beer and wine. “Drinkwater” and “Boileau” were unusual names,
indicating unusual tastes. Cider or perry was made from apples or pears,
and provided cheap intoxicants for the peasantry. Drunkenness was a
favorite vice of the Middle Ages, in all classes and sexes. Taverns were
numerous, ale was cheap. Beer was the regular drink of the poor, even at
breakfast. Monasteries and hospitals north of the Alps were normally
allowed a gallon of ale or beer per person per day. 119 Many
monasteries, castles, and rich homes had their own breweries, for in the
northern countries beer was reckoned as second only to bread as a
necessary of life. Among the well-to-do of all nations, and in all ranks
of Latin Europe, wine was preferred. France produced the most famous
wines, and proclaimed their glory in a thousand popular songs. At
vintage time the peasants worked harder than usual, and were rewarded by
good abbots with a moral holiday. A customal of the abbey of St. Peter
in the Black Forest includes some tender clauses:</p>
<p>When the peasants have unladen the wine, they shall be brought</p>
<p>into the monastery, and shall have meat and drink in abundance. A</p>
<p>great tub shall be set there and filled with wine… and each shall</p>
<p>drink… and if they wax drunken and smite the cellarman or the</p>
<p>cook, they shall pay no fine for this deed; and they shall drink so
that two of them cannot beat the third to the wagon. 120</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>838</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXAfter a banquet the host would usually offer entertainment by
jugglers, tumblers, players, minstrels, or buffoons. Some manor houses
had their own staff of such entertainers; some rich men kept jesters
whose merry impu- dence and ribald humor could be vented without fear
and without reproach. If the diners preferred to provide their own
amusement they could tell stories, hear or make music, dance, flirt,
play backgammon, chess, or parlor games; even barons and baronesses
romped abo ut in “forfeits” and “blind man’s buff.” Playing cards were
still unknown. French laws of 1256 and 1291 forbade making, or playing
with, dice, but gambling with dice was widespread nonetheless, and
moralists told of fortunes and souls lost in the game. Gambling was not
always forbidden by law’; Siena provided booths for it in the public
square. 121 Chess was prohibited by a council at Paris (1213) and by an
edict of Louis IX (1254); no one paid much attention to these demurrers;
the game became a consuming pastime among the aris- tocracy, and gave
its name to the royal exchequer — a chequered table or chessboard on
which the revenues of the state were reckoned. 122 In Dante’s youth a
Saracen player set all Florence agape by playing three games of chess at
once against the best players of the city; he looked at one board and
kept the plays on the other two in his head; of the three games he won
two and tied the third. 123 The game of checkers was played in France as
dames , in England as “draughts.”</p>
<p>Dancing was condemned by preachers, and was practiced by nearly all
persons except those dedicated to religion. St. Thomas Aquinas, with
char- acteristic moderation, allowed dancing at weddings, or on the
homecoming of a friend from abroad, or to celebrate some national
victory; and the hearty saint went so far as to say that dancing, if
kept decent, was a very healthy exercise. 124 Albertus Magnus showed a
like liberality, but medieval moralists generally reprobated the dance
as an invention of the Devil. 125 The Church frowned upon it as
provocative of immorality; 126 the young blades of the Middle Ages did
their best to justify her suspicions. 127 The French and Ger- mans in
particular were fond of the dance, and developed many folk dances to
mark the festivals of the agricultural year, to celebrate victories, or
to sustain public spirit in depression or plague. One of the Carmina
Burma de- scribes the dances of girls in the fields as among the
sweetest pleasures of spring. When knighthood was conferred all the
knights of the vicinity gath- ered in full armor and performed
evolutions on horseback or on foot, while the populace danced around
them to the accompaniment of martial music. Dancing could become an
epidemic: in 1237 a band of German children danced all the way from
Erfurt to Amstadt; many died en route; and some survivors suffered to
the end of their lives from St. Vitus’ dance, or other nervous
disorders. 128</p>
<p>Most dancing took place by day and in the open air. Houses were
poorly lit at night — by standing or hanging lamps with wick and oil, or
a rushlight</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) MORALS AND MANNERS 839</p>
<p>orch of mutton fat; and as fat and oils were expensive, very little
work or reading was done after sunset. Soon after dark the guests
dispersed, and the household retired. Bedrooms seldom sufficed; it was
not uncommon to find an extra bed in the hall or reception room. The
poor slept well on beds of straw, the rich slept poorly on perfumed
pillows and feather mattresses. Lordly beds were overhung with mosquito
netting or a canopy, and were mounted with the aid of stools. Several
persons, of any age or sex, might sleep in the same room. In England and
France all classes slept nude. 129</p>

<li>SOCIETY AND SPORT</li>
</ol>
<p>The general coarseness of medieval manners was smoothed by certain
graces of feudal courtesy. Men shook hands on meeting, as a pledge of
peace through unreadiness to draw a sword. Titles were innumerable, in a
hundred grades of dignity; and by a charming custom each dignitary was
addressed by his title and his Christian name, or the name of his
estate. A code of man- ners was drawn up for polite society in any
circumstance — at home, at the dance, on the street, at tournament, at
court; ladies had to learn how to walk, curtsey, ride horseback, play,
carry falcons gracefully on the wrist… ; all this, and a like code for
men, constituted courtoisie, the manners of the court, courtesy. The
thirteenth century saw the publication of many guides to etiquette.
130</p>
<p>In traveling, one expected courtesies and hospitality from persons of
his own class. The poor for charity, the rich for fee or gift, would be
sheltered en route by convents or monasteries. As early as the eighth
century monks established hospices in the passes of the Alps. Some
monasteries had great guest-houses capable of sheltering 300 wayfarers,
and stabling their horses. 131 Most travelers, however, put up at
wayside inns; rates were low there, and a wench might be had at a
reasonable rate, if one guarded his purse. Offered such comforts, many
braved the dangers of travel — merchants, bankers, priests, diplomats,
pilgrims, students, monks, tourists, tramps. The highways of the Middle
Ages, however discouraging, were alive with curious and hopeful people
who thought that they would be happier somewhere else.</p>
<p>Class distinctions were as sharp in amusement as in travel. The
mighty and the lowly mingled now and then: when the king held a public
assembly of his vassals, and distributed food to the crowd; when the
aristocratic cavalry performed martial maneuvers; when some prince or
princess, king or queen, entered the city in panoplied state, and masses
lined the highway to feed on pageantry; or when a tournament or trial by
combat was opened to the public eye. Planned spectacles were a vital
part of medieval life; church processions, political parades, guild
celebrations, filled the streets with ban- ners, floats, wax saints, fat
merchants, prancing knights, and military bands.</p>
<p>84O THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXTraveling mummers staged short plays in the village or city
square; minstrels sang and played and strummed romantic tales; acrobats
tumbled and jug- gled, and men and women walked or danced on tightropes
across mortal chasms; or two blindfolded men belabored each other with
sticks; or a circus would come to town, exhibit strange animals and
stranger men, and pit one animal against another in combat to the
death.</p>
<p>Among the nobility hunting rivaled jousting as the royal sport. Game
laws restricted the season to brief periods, and poaching laws kept game
preserves for the aristocracy. The woods of Europe were still inhabited
by beasts who had not yet acknowledged the victory of man in the war for
the planet; medieval Paris, for example, was several times invaded by
wolves. In one aspect the hunter was engaged in maintaining man’s
precarious ascendancy; in another he was adding to the food supply; and,
not least, he was pre- paring himself for inevitable war by hardening
body and spirit to danger, combat, and the shedding of blood. At the
same time he made this, too, a pageant. Great olifants — hunting horns
of ivory, sometimes chased with gold — rounded up the ladies and
gentlemen and dogs: women sitting daintily side- saddle on prancing
steeds; men in colorful attire and varied armament — bow and arrow,
small ax, spear, and knife; greyhounds, staghounds, bloodhounds,
boarhounds pulling on the leash. If the chase led across a peasant’s
fields, the baron, his vassals, and his guests were free to cross them
at whatever cost to seeds and crops; and only reckless peasants would
complain. 132 TheFrench aristocracy organized hunting into a system,
gave it the name of chasse, and developed for it a complex ritual and
etiquette.</p>
<p>The ladies joined with especial flair in the most aristocratic game
of all- falconry. Nearly all great estates had aviaries housing a
variety of birds, of which the falcon was most prized. It was taught to
perch on my lord or lady’s wrist at any ti me; some piquant dames kept
them so while hearing Mass. The Emperor Frederick II wrote an excellent
book on falconry, run- ning to 589 pages, and introduced into Europe
from Islam the custom of controlling the nerves and curiosity of the
bird by covering its head with a leather hood. Different varieties were
trained to fly up and attack diverse birds, kill or wound them, and
return to the hunter’s wrist; there, lured and rewarded by a bit of
meat, they allowed their feet to be snared in straps until fresh prey
flew into view. A well-trained falcon was almost the finest gift that
could be made to noble or king. The duke of Burgundy ransomed his son by
sending twelve white hawks to the captor, Sultan Bajazet. The office of
grand falconer of France was one of the highest and best paid in the
kingdom.</p>
<p>Many another sport made tolerable the summer’s heat and the winter’s
cold, and turned the passions and energies of youth to vital skills.
Practically every lad learned to swim; and in the North all learned to
skate. Horse racing was popular, especially in Italy. All classes
practiced archery; but only the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) MORALS AND MANNERS 841</p>
<p>working classes had the leisure to fish. There were divers games of
bowling, hockey, quoits, wrestling, boxing, tennis, football…. Tennis
developed in France, probably from Moslem antecedents; the name was
apparently de- rived from the tenez! — “play ! ’’— with which a player
announced his serve. 133 The sport became so popular in France and
England that it was sometimes played before large crowds in theaters or
the open air. 134 The Irish played hockey as early as our second
century; and a Byzantine historian of the twelfth century gives a vivid
description of a polo match played with cord- strung racquets as in
lacrosse. 135 Football, says a horrified medieval chron- icler, “is an
abominable game wherein young people propel a huge ball not by throwing
it into the air but by striking and rolling it along the ground, not
with their hands but with the ir feet.” 136 Apparently the game had come
from China to Italy 137 to England, where it became so popular and
violent in the thirteenth century that Edward II banned it as. leading
to breaches of the peace (1314).</p>
<p>Life was more social then than later; group activities stirred the
monaster- ies, nunneries, universities, villages, guilds. Life was
especially hilarious on Sundays and solemn holydays; then the peasant,
the merchant, and the lord dressed their best, prayed the longest, drank
the most. 138 On May Day the English raised Maypoles, lit bonfires, and
danced around them in semi- conscious recollection of pagan fertility
feasts. At Christmas time many towns and chateaux appointed a Lord of
Misrule to organize pastimes and spectacles for the populace. Mummers in
masks and beards and jolly garb went about performing street plays or
pranks, or singing Christmas carols; houses and churches were decked
with holly, ivy, “and whatsoever the</p>
<p>Some festivals adapted the ceremonies of the Church to boisterous
parodies that ranged from simple humor to scandalous satire. Beauvais,
Sens, and other French towns through many years celebrated on January 14
a fete de I’dne, or Festival of the Ass: a pretty girl was placed on an
ass, apparently to rep- resent Mary on the Flight to Egypt; the ass was
led into a church, was made to genuflect, was stationed beside the
altar, and heard a Mass and hymns sung in its praise; and at the end
both the priest and the congregation brayed thrice in honor of the
animal that had saved the Mother of God from Herod, and borne Jesus into
Jerusalem. 141 A dozen cities of France celebrated annu- ally — usually
on the Feast of the Circumcision — a fete des foils, or Feast of Fools.
On that day the lower clergy were allowed to revenge themselves for
their subordination to priest and bishop during the year by taking over
the</p>
<p>842 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXchurch and the ritual; they dressed themselves in feminine
costumes, or in ecclesiastical vestments turned inside out; they chose
one of their number to be episcopus ]atuorum or fools’ bishop; they cha
nted ribald hymns, ate sausages on the altar, played dice at its foot,
burned old shoes in the censer, and preached hilarious sermons. 142 In
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries many towns in England, Germany,
and France chose an episcopus puerorum , or boys’ bishop, to lead his
fellows in a good -humored imitation of ecclesi- astical ceremonies. 143
The local clergy smiled on these popular buffooneries; the Church closed
her eyes to them for a long time; but as they tended to ever greater
irreverence and indecency she was forced to condemn them, and they
finally disappeared in the sixteenth century.*</p>
<p>In general the Church was lenient with the lusty humor of the Age of
Faith; she knew that men must have a moral holiday now and then, a mora-
torium on the unnatural moral restraints normally necessary to a
civilized society. Some ultra- Puritans like St. John Chrysostom might
cry out: “Christ is crucified, and yet you laugh!”— but there continued
to be “cakes and ale,” and wine ran hot in the mouth. St. Bernard was
suspicious of mirth and beauty; but most churchmen in the thirteenth
century were hearty livers who enjoyed their meat and drink with a good
conscience, and took no of- fense at a well-turned joke or ankle. The
Age of Faith was not so solemn after all; rather it was an age of
abounding vitality and full-blooded merri- ment, and tender sentiment,
and a simple joy in the blessings of the earth. On the back of a
medieval vocabulary book some wistful student wrote a wish for all of
us:</p>
<p>And I wish that all times were April and May, and every month</p>
<p>renew all fruits again, and every day fleur-de-lis and gillyflower
and</p>
<p>violets and roses wherever one goes, and woods in leaf and meadows
green, and every lover should have his lass, and they to love each other
with a sure heart and true, and to everyone his pleasure and a gay</p>
<p>heart. 145</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>MORALITY AND RELIGION</li>
</ol>
<p>Does the general picture of medieval Europe support the belief that
religion makes for morality?</p>
<p>Our general impression suggests a wider gap between moral theory and
practice in the Middle Ages than in other epochs of civilization.
Medieval Christendom was apparently as rich as our own irreligious age
in sensuality, violence, drunkenness, cruelty, coarseness, profanity,
greed, robbery, dis- honesty, and fraud. It seems to have outdone our
time in the enslavement of individuals, but not to have rivaled it in
the economic enslavement of colonial areas or defeated states. It
surpassed us in the subjection of women;</p>
<p>A boys’ bishop, however, is still annually elected at Addlestone,
Surrey, England. 144</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) MORALS AND MANNERS 843</p>
<p>it hardly equaled us in immodesty, fornication, and adultery, or in
the im- mensity and murderousness of war. Compared with the Roman Empire
from Nerva to Aurelius, medieval Christendom was a moral setback; but
much of the Empire had in Nerva’s day enjoyed many centuries of
civilization, while the Middle Ages, through most of their duration,
represented a struggle between Christian morality and a virile barbarism
that largely ignored the ethics of the religion whose theology it
indifferently received. The barbari- ans would have called some of their
vices virtues, as necessary to their time: their violence as the other
side of courage, their sensuality as animal health, their coarse and
direct speech, and their shameless talk about natural things, as no
worse than the introverted prudery of our youth.</p>
<p>It would be an easy matter to condemn medieval Christendom from the
mouths of its own moralists. St. Francis bemoaned the thirteenth century
as “these times of superabundant malice and iniquity”; 146 Innocent III,
St. Bonaventura, Vincent of Beauvais, Dante considered the morals of
that “wonderful century” to be dishe arteningly gross; and Bishop
Grosseteste, one of the most judicious prelates of the age, told the
pope that “the Cath - olic population, as a body, was incorporate with
the Devil.” 147 Roger Bacon (i2i4?~94) judged his time with
characteristic hyperbole:</p>
<p>Never was so much ignorance Far more sins reign in these days</p>
<p>han in any past age… boundless corruption… lechery… gluttony.</p>
<p>… Yet we have baptism and the revelation of Christ… which men</p>
<p>cannot really believe in or revere, or they would not allow
themselves to be so corrupted…. Therefore many wise men believe that
Anti-</p>
<p>christ is at hand, and the end of the world. 148</p>
<p>Such passages, of course, are the exaggerations necessary to
reformers, and could be matched in any age.</p>
<p>Apparently the fear of hell had less effect in raising the moral
level than the fear of public opinion or the law has now — or had then;
but the public opinion, and in a measure the law, had been formed by
Christianity. Probably the moral chaos, born of half a millennium of
invasion, war, and devastation, would have been far worse without the
moderating effect of the Christian ethic. Our selection of instances in
this chapter may have been unwittingly biased; at best they are
fragmentary; statistics are lacking or unreliable; and history always
leaves out the average man. There must have been, in medieval
Christendom, thousands of good and simple people like Fra Salimbene’s
mother, whom he describes as “a humble lady and devout, fasting much ,
and gladly dispensing alms to the poor”; 149 but how often do such women
make the pages of history?</p>
<p>Christianity brought some moral retrogressions and some moral
advances. The intellectual virtues naturally declined in the Age of
Faith; intellectual conscience (fairness with the facts) and the search
for truth were replaced</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>844</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXby zeal and admiration for sanctity, and a sometimes unscrupulous
piety; “pious frauds” of textual doctoring and documentary forgery
seemed negligible venial sins. The civic virtues suffered from
concentration on the afterlife, but more from the disintegration of the
state; nevertheless there must have been some patriotism, however local,
in the men and women who built so many cathedrals and some lordly town
halls. Perhaps hypocrisy, so indispensable to civilization, increased in
the Middle Ages as compared with the frank secularism of antiquity, or
the unabashed corporate brutality of our time.</p>
<p>Against these and other debits many credits stand. Christianity
struggled with heroic tenacity against an inundation of barbarism. It
labored to di- minish war and feud, trial by combat or ordeal; it
extended the intervals of truce and peace, and sublimated something of
feudal violence and pugnacity into devotion and chivalry. It suppressed
the gladiatorial shows, denounced the enslavement of prisoners, forbade
the enslavement of Christians, ran- somed numberless captives, and
encouraged — more than it practiced — the emancipation of serfs. It
taught men a new respect for human life and work. It stopped
infanticide, lessened abortion, and softened the penalties exacted by
Roman and barbarian law. It steadfastly rejected the double standard in
sexual morality. It immensely expanded the scope and operations of char-
ity. It gave men peace of mind against the baffling riddles of the
universe, though at the cost of discouraging science and philosophy.
Finally, it taught men that patriotism unchecked by a higher loyalty is
a tool of mass greed and crime. Over all the competing cities and petty
states of Europe it estab- lished and maintained one moral law. Under
its guidance, and at some nec- essary sacrifice of liberty, Europe
achieved for a century that international morality for which it prays
and struggles today — a law that shall raise states out of their jungle
code, and free the energies of men for the battles and victories of
peace.</p>
