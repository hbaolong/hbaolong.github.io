<h4 id="chapter-i-the-background-of-revolution">CHAPTER I The Background
of Revolution</h4>
<p>1774-89</p>
<p>I. THE FRENCH PEOPLE</p>
<p>F RANCE was the most populous and prosperous nation in Europe. Rus-
sia in 1780 had 24 million inhabitants, Italy 17 million, Spain 10
million, Great Britain 9 million* Prussia 8.6 million, Austria 7.9
million, Ireland 4 mil- lion, Belgium 2.2 million, Portugal 2.1 million,
Sweden 2 million, Holland</p>
<p>1.9 million, Switzerland 1.4 million, Denmark 800,000, Norway
700,000, France 25 million. 1 Paris was the largest city in Europe, with
some 650,000 inhabitants, the best-educated and most excitable in
Europe.</p>
<p>The people of France were divided into three orders, or classes (
etats — states or estates) : the clergy, some 1 3o,ooo 2 souls; the
nobility, some 400,000; and the Tiers £tat, which included everybody
else; the Revolution was the attempt of this economically rising but
politically disadvantaged Third Es- tate to achieve political power and
social acceptance commensurate with its growing wealth. Each of the
classes was divided into subgroups or layers, so that nearly everyone
could enjoy the sight of persons below him.</p>
<p>The richest class was the ecclesiastical hierarchy — cardinals,
archbishops, bishops, and abbots; among the poorest were the pastors and
curates of the countryside; here the economic factor crossed the lines
of doctrine, and in the Revolution the lower clergy joined with the
commonalty against their own superiors. Monastic life had lost its lure;
the Benedictines, numbering 6,434 in ^ France of 1770, had been reduced
to 4,300 in 1790; nine orders of “religious” had been disbanded by 1780,
and in 1773 the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) had been dissolved.
Religion in general had declined in the French cities; in many towns the
churches were half empty; and among the peasantry pagan customs and old
superstitions competed actively with the doctrines and ceremonies of the
Church. 3 The nuns, however, were still actively devoted to teaching and
nursing, and were honored by rich and poor alike. Even in that skeptical
and practical age there were thousands of women, children, and men who
eased the buffets of life with piety, fed their imaginations with tales
of the saints, interrupted the succession of toilsome days with holyday
ritual and rest, and found in religious hopes an anodyne to defeat and a
refuge from bewilderment and despair.</p>
<p>The state supported the Church because statesmen generally agreed
that the clergy gave them indispensable aid in preserving social order.
In their view the natural inequality of human endowment made inevitable
an un-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>equal distribution of wealth; it seemed important, for the safety of
the pos- sessing classes, that a corps of clerics should be maintained
to provide the poor with counsels of peaceful humility and expectation
of a compensating Paradise. It meant much to France that the family,
buttressed with religion, remained as the basis of national stability
through all vicissitudes of the state. Moreover, obedience was
encouraged by belief in the divine right of kings — the divine origin of
their appointment and power; the clergy inculcated this belief, and the
kings felt that this myth was a precious aid to their personal security
and orderly rule. So they left to the Catholic clergy almost all forms
of public education; and when the growth of Protestantism in France
threatened to weaken the authority and usefulness of the national
Church, the Huguenots were ruthlessly expelled.</p>
<p>Grateful for these services, the state allowed the Church to collect
tithes and other income from each parish, and to manage the making of
wills — which encouraged moribund sinners to buy promissory notes,
collectible in heaven, in exchange for earthly property bequeathed to
the Church. The government exempted the clergy from taxation, and
contented itself with receiving, now and then, a substantial don
gratuit, or free grant, from the Church. So variously privileged, the
Church in France accumulated large domains, reckoned by some as a fifth
of the soil; 4 and these it ruled as feudal properties, collecting
feudal dues. It turned the contributions of the faithful into gold and
silver ornaments which, like the jewels of the crown, were consecrated
and inviolable hedges against the inflation that seemed ingrained in
history.</p>
<p>Many parish priests, mulcted of parish income by the tithe, labored
in pious poverty, while many bishops lived in stately elegance, and
lordly arch- bishops, far from their sees, fluttered about the court of
the king. As the French government neared bankruptcy, while the French
Church (accord- ing to Talleyrand’s estimate) enjoyed an annual income
of 150 mill ion livres,* the tax-burdened Third Estate wondered why the
Church should not be compelled to share its wealth with the state. When
the literature of unbelief spread, thousands of middle-class citizens
and hundreds of aristo- crats shed the Christian faith, and were ready
to view with philosophic calm the raids of the Revolution upon the
sacred, guarded hoard.</p>
<p>The nobility was vaguely conscious that it had outlived many of
the</p>
<p>functions that had been its reasons for being. Its proudest element,
the no- bility of the sword ( noblesse d’epee), had served as the
military guard, economic director, and judiciary head of the
agricultural communities; but much of these services had been superseded
by the centralization of power and administration under Richelieu and
Louis XIV; many of the seigneurs now lived at the court and neglected
their domains; and their rich raiment, fine manners, and general
amiability 5 seemed, in 1789, insufficient reason for owning a fourth of
the soil and exacting feudal dues.</p>
<p>The more ancient families among them called themselves la noblesse

<p>THE BACKGROUND OF REVOLUTION</p>

<p>race, tracing their origin to the Germanic Franks who had conquered
and renamed Gaul in the fifth century; in 1789 Camille Desmoulins would
turn this.boast against them as alien invaders when he called for
revolution as a long-delayed racial revenge. Actually some ninety-five
percent of the French nobility were increasingly bourgeois and Celtic,
having mated their lands and titles to the new wealth and agile brains
of the middle class.</p>
<p>A rising portion of the aristocracy — the noblesse de robe, or
nobility of the gown — consisted of some four thousand families whose
heads had been appointed to judicial or administrative posts that
automatically endowed their holders with nobility. As most such posts
had been sold by the king or his ministers to raise revenue for the
state, many of the purchasers felt warranted in regaining their outlay
by a genial susceptibility to bribes; 6 “venality in office” was
“unusually widespread in France,” 7 and was one of a hundred complaints
against the dying regime. Some of these titles to office and rank were
hereditary, and as their holders multiplied, especially in the
parlements, or law courts, of the various districts, their pride and
power grew to the point where in 1787 the Parlement of Paris claimed the
right to veto the decrees of the king. In terms of time the Revolution
began near the top.</p>
<p>In Qu’est -ce que le Tiers etat ? — a pamphlet published in January,
1789 — the Abbe Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyes asked and answered three
questions: What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been till
now? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something, 8 or, in Chamfort’s
emendation, tout— everything. It was nearly everything. It included the
bourgeoisie, or middle class, with its 100,000 families® and its many
layers — bankers, brokers, manu- facturers, merchants, managers,
lawyers, physicians, scientists, teachers, art- ists, authors,
journalists, the press (the fou rth “estate,” or power); and the menu
peuple, “little people” (sometimes called “the people”), consisting of
the proletariat and tradesmen of the towns, the transport workers on
land or sea, and the peasantry.</p>
<p>The upper middle classes held and managed a rising and spreading
force: the power of mobile money and other capital in aggressive,
expansive com- petition with the power of static land or a declining
creed. They speculated on the stock exchanges of Paris, London, and
Amsterdam, and, in Necker’ s estimate, controlled half the money of
Europe. 10 They financed the French government with loans, and
threatened to overthrow it if their loans and charges were not met. They
owned or managed the rapidly developing min- ing and metallurgical
industry of northern France, the textile industry of Lyons, Troyes,
Abbeville, Lille, and Rouen, the iron and salt works of Lor- raine, the
soap factories of Marseilles, the tanneries of Paris. They managed the
capitalist industry that was replacing the craft shops and guilds of the
past; they welcomed the doctrine of the Physiocrats 11 that free
enterprise would be more stimulating and productive than the traditional
regulation of industry and trade by the state. They financed and
organized the transfor- mation of raw materials into finished goods, and
transported these from pro-</p>

<p>ducer to consumer, making a profit at both ends. They benefited from
thirty thousand miles of the best roads in Europe, but they denounced
the obstructive tolls that were charged on the roads and canals of
France, and the different weights and measures jealously maintained by
individual prov- inces. They controlled the commerce that was enriching
Bordeaux, Mar- seilles, and Nantes; they formed great stock companies
like the Compagnie des Indes and the Compagnie des Eaux; they widened
the market from the town to the world; and through such trade they
developed for France an overseas empire second only to England’s. They
felt that they, not the</p>
<p>It was they who filled the theaters and applauded Beaumarchai s’
satires of the aristocracy. It was they, even more than the nobility,
who joined the Freemason lodges to work for freedom of life and thought;
they who read Voltaire and relished his erosive wit, and agreed with
Gibbon that all re- ligions are equally false for the philosopher and
equally useful for the states- man. They secretly admired the
materialism of d’Holbach and Helvetius; it might not be quite just to
the mysteries of life and mind, but it was a handy weapon against a
Church that controlled most of the minds, and half the wealth, of
France. They agreed with Diderot that nearly everything in the existing
regime was absurd — though they smiled at his longing for Tahiti. They
did not take to Rousseau, who smelled of socialism and reeked with
certainty; but they, more than any other section of French society, felt
and spread the influence of literature and philosophy.</p>
<p>Generally the philosophes were moderate in their politics. They
accepted monarchy, and did not resent royal gifts; they looked to
“enlightened des - pots” like Frederick II of Prussia, Joseph II of
Austria, even Catherine II of Russia, rather than to the illiterate and
emotional masses, as engineers of re- form. They put their trust in
reason, though they knew its limits and malle- ability. They broke down
the censorship of thought by Church and state, and opened and broadened
a million minds; they prepared for the triumphs of science in the
nineteenth century, even — with Lavoisier, Laplace, and Lamarck — amid
the turmoil of revolution and war.</p>
<p>Rousseau disassociated himself from the philosophes. He respected
rea- son, but gave high place to sentiment and an inspiring, comforting
faith; his “Savoyard Vicar’s Profession of Faith” provided a religious
stance to</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE BACKGROUND OF REVOLUTION 7</p>
<p>Robespierre, and his insistence upon a uniform national creed allowed
the Committee of Public Safety to make political heresy — at least in
wartime — a capital crime. The Jacobins of the Revolution accepted the
doctrine of The Social Contract: that man is by nature good, and becomes
bad by being sub- jected to corrupt institutions and unjust laws; that
men are born free and become slaves in an artificial civilization. When
in power the Revolutionary leaders adopted Rousseau’s idea that the
citizen, by receiving the protection</p>
<p>The “people,” in the terminology of the Revolution, meant the
peasants and the town workers. Even in the towns the factory employees
were a minority of the population; the picture there was not a
succession of fac- tories but rather a humming medley of butchers,
bakers, brewers, grocers, cooks, peddlers, barbers, shopkeepers,
innkeepers, vintners, carpenters, ma- sons, house painters, glass
workers, plasterers, tilers, shoemakers, dress- makers, dyers, cleaners,
tailors, blacksmiths, servants, cabinetmakers, saddlers, wheelwrights,
goldsmiths, cutlers, weavers, tanners, printers, booksellers,
prostitutes, and thieves. These workers wore ankle-length pantaloons
rather than the knee breeches ( culottes ) and stockings of the upper
classes; so they were named “sansculottes,” and as such they played a
dramatic part in the Revolution. The influx of gold and silver from the
New World, and the re- peated issuance of paper money, raised prices
everywhere in Europe; in France, between 1741 and 1789, they rose 65
percent, while wages rose 22 percent. 14 In Lyons 30,000 persons were on
relief in 1787; in Paris 100,000 families were listed as indigent in
1791. Labor unions for economic action were forbidden; so were strikes,
but they were frequent. As the Revolution neared, the workers were in an
increasingly despondent and rebellious mood. Give them guns and a
leader, and they would take the Bastille, invade the Tuileries, and
depose the King.</p>
<p>The peasants of France, in 1789, were presumably better off than a
cen- tury before, when La Bruyere, exaggerating to point a theme, had
mistaken them for beasts. 15 They were better off than the other
peasants of Conti- nental Europe, possibly excepting those of northern
Italy. About a third of the tilled land was held by peasant proprietors;
a third was farmed out by noble, ecclesiastical, or bourgeois owners to
tenants or sharecroppers; the rest was worked by hired hands under
supervision by the owner or his steward. More and more of the owners —
themselves harassed by rising costs and keener competition — were
enclosing, for tillage or pasturage, “common lands” on which the
peasants had formerly been free to graze t heir cattle or gather
wood.</p>
<p>All but a few “allodial” (obligation -free) peasant holders were
subject to feudal dues. They were bound by contract charter to give the
seigneur — the lord of the manor — several days of unpaid labor every
year (the corvee) to</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>aid him in farming his land and repairing his roads; and they paid
him a toll whenever they used those roads. They owed him a moderate
quitrent an- nually in produce or cash. If they sold their holding he
was entitled to io or 1 5 percent of the purchase price. 16 They paid
him if they fished in his waters or pastured their animals on his field.
They owed him a fee every time they used his mill, his bake-house, his
wine- or oil-press. As these fees were fixed by the charters, and lost
value through inflation, the owner felt warranted in extracting them
with increasing rigor as prices rose. 17</p>
<p>To support the Church that blessed nis crops, formed his children to
obedience and belief, and dignified his life with sacraments, the
peasant con- tributed to it annually a tithe — usually less than a tenth
— of his produce. Heavier than tithe or feudal dues were the taxes laid
upon him by the state: a poll or head tax (capitation) , the vingtieme
or twentieth of his yearly in- come, a sales tax (aide) on his every
purchase of gold or silver ware, metal products, alcohol, paper, starch…
, and the gabelle , which required him to buy in each year a prescribed
amount of salt from the government at a price fixed by the government.
As the nobility and the clergy found legal or il- legal ways of avoiding
many of these taxes — and as, in wartime levies, well- to-do youths
could buy substitutes to die in their place — the main burden of support
for state and Church, in war and peace, fell upon the peasantry.</p>
<p>These taxes, tithes, and feudal dues could be borne when harvests
were good, but they brought misery when, through war damages or the
weather’s whims, the harvest turned bad, and a year’s exhausting toil
seemed spent in vain. Then many peasant owners sold their land or their
labor, or both, to luckier gamblers with the soil.</p>
<p>The year 1788 was marked by merciless “acts of God.” A severe drought
stunted crops; a hailstorm, raging from Normandy to Champagne, devas-
tated 180 miles of usually fertile terrain; the winter (1788-89) was the
se- verest in eighty years; fruit trees perished by the thousands. The
spring of 1789 loosed disastrous floods; the summer brought famine to
almost every province. State, church, and private charity strove to get
food to the starv- ing; only a few individuals died of hunger, but
millions came close to the end of their resources. Caen, Rouen, Orleans,
Nancy, Lyons, saw rival groups fighting like animals for corn;
Marseilles saw 8,000 famished people at its gates threatening to invade
and pillage the city; in Paris the working- class district of
St.-Antoine had 30,000 paupers to be cared for. 18 Mean- while a
trade-easing treaty with Great Britain (1786) had deluged France with
industrial products down-pricing native goods and throwing thousands of
French laborers out of work — 25,000 in Lyons, 46,000 in Amiens, 80,000
in Paris. 19 In March, 1789, peasants refused to pay taxes, adding to
fears of national bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Arthur Young, traveling in the French provinces in July, 1789, met
a</p>
<p>peasant woman who complained of the taxes and feudal dues that kept
her always at the edge of destitution. But, she added, she had learned
that “some - thing was to be done by some great folks for such poor
ones,… for the taxes and the dues are crushing us.” 20 They had heard
that Louis XVI was a</p>

<p>good man, eager to reform abuses and protect the poor. They looked
hope- fully to Versailles, and prayed for the long life of the King.</p>

<p>He was a good man, but hardly a good king. He had not expected to
rule, but the early death of his father (1765) made him dauphin, and the
tardy death of his grandfather Louis XV (1774) made him, at the age of
twenty, master of France. He had no desire to govern men; he had a knack
with tools, and was an excellent locksmith. He preferred hunting to
ruling; he counted that day lost in which he had not shot a stag;
between 1774 and 1789 he ran down 1,274 °f them, and killed 189,251
game; yet he was al- ways unwilling to order the death of a man; and
perhaps he lost his throne because he bade his Swiss Guards to hold
their fire on August 10, 1792. Returning from his hunts he ate to the
steadily increasing capacity of his stomach. He became fat but strong,
with the gentle strength of a giant who fears to crush with his embrace.
Marie Antoinette judged her husband well: “The King is not a coward; he
possesses abundance of passive courage, but he is overwhelmed by an
awkward shyness and mistrust of himself…. He is afraid to command…. He
lived like a child, and always ill at ease, under the eyes of Louis XV,
until the age of twenty-one. This constraint con- firmed his timidity.”
21</p>
<p>His love for his Queen was part of his undoing. She was beautiful and
stately, she graced his court with her charm and gaiety, and she forgave
his tardiness in consummating their marriage. The tightness of his
foreskin made coitus unbearably painful to him; he tried again and
again, for seven years, shunning the simple operation that would have
solved his problem; then, in 1777 , the Queen’s brother Joseph II of
Austria persuaded him to submit to the knife, and soon all was well.
Perhaps it was a sense of guilt at so often arousing and then failing
his mate that made him too tolerant of her gambling at cards, her
extravagant wardrobe, her frequent trips to Paris for opera that bored
him, her Platonic or Sapphic friendship with Count von Fersen or the
Princesse de Lamballe. He amused his courtiers, and shamed his
ancestors, by being visibly devoted to his wife. He gave her costly
jewels, but she and France wanted a child. When children came she proved
to be a good mother, suffering with their ailments and moderating nearly
all her faults except her pride (she had never been less than part of
royalty) and her repeated intervention in affairs of state. Here she had
some excuses, for Louis could seldom choose or keep a course, and often
waited for the Queen to make up his mind; some courtiers wished he had
her quick judgment and readiness to command.</p>
<p>The King did all he could to meet the crises laid upon him by the</p>
<p>weather, the famine, the bread riots, the revolt against taxes, the
demands of the nobility and the Parlement, the expenses of the court and
the ad- ministration, and the growing deficit in the Treasury. For two

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>(1774-76) he allowed Turgot to apply the Physiocratic theory that
free- dom of enterprise and competition, and the unhindered dictatorship
of the market — of supply and demand — over the wages of labor and the
prices of goods, would enliven the French economy and bring added
revenue to the state. The people of Paris, accustomed to think of the
government as their sole protection against greedy mani pulators of the
market, opposed Turgot’s measures, rioted, and rejoiced at his fall.</p>
<p>After some months of hesitation and chaos, the King called
Jacques</p>
<p>Necker, a Swiss Protestant financier domiciled in Paris, to be
director of the Treasury (1777-81). Under this alien and heretical
leadership Louis undertook a brave program of minor reforms. He allowed
the formation of elected local and provincial assemblies to serve as the
voice of their con- stituents in bridging the gap between the people and
the government. He shocked the nobles by denouncing the corvee, and by
declaring, in a public statement (1780), “The taxes of the poorest part
of our subjects [have] increased, in proportion, much more than all the
rest”; and he expressed his “hopes that r ich people will not think
themselves wronged when they will have to meet the charges which long
since they should have shared with others.” 22 He freed the last of the
serfs on his own lands, but resisted Necker’s urging to require a like
measure from t he nobility and the clergy. He established pawnshops to
lend money to the poor at three percent. He forbade the use of torture
in the examination of witnesses or criminals. He proposed to abolish the
dungeons at Vincennes and to raze the Bastille as items in a program of
prison reform. Despite his piety and orthodoxy he allowed a considerable
degree of religious liberty to Protestants and Jews. He refused to
punish free thought, and allowed the ruthless pamphleteers of Paris to
lampoon him as a cuckold, his wife as a harlot, and his children as
bastards. He forbade his government to spy into the private
correspondence of the citizens.</p>
<p>With the enthusiastic support of Beaumarchais and the philosophies,
and over the objections of Necker (who predicted that such a venture
would complete the bankruptcy of France), Louis sent material and
financial aid, amounting to 40,000,000, to the American colonies in
their struggle for independence; it was a French fleet, and the
battalions of Lafayette and Rochambeau, that helped Washington to bottle
up Cornwallis in Yorktown, compelling him to surrender and so bring the
war to a close. But democratic ideas swept across the Atlantic into
France, the Treasury stumbled under its new debts, Necker was dismissed
(1781), and the bourgeois bondholders clamored for financial control of
the government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Parlement of Paris pressed its claim to check the
monar- chy through a veto power over the decrees of the King; and
Louis-Philippe- Joseph, Due d’Orleans— his cousin through direct descent
from a younger brother of Louis XIV — almost openly schemed to capture
the throne. Through Choderlos de Laclos and other agents he scattered
money and promises among politicians, pamphleteers, orators, and
prostitutes. He threw</p>

<p>open to his followers the facilities, court, and gardens of his
Palais-Royal; cafes, wineshops, bookstores and gambling clubs sprang up
to accommodate the crowd that gathered there day and night; the news
from Versailles was brought there speedily by special couriers;
pamphlets were born there every hour; speeches resounded from platforms,
tables, and chairs; plots were laid for the deposition of the King.</p>
<p>Harassed to desperation, Louis recalled Necker to the Ministry of Fi-
nance (1788). On Necker’s urging, and as a last and perilous resort
that</p>
<p>There were some remarkable features about this historic call to the
coun- try by a government that for almost two centuries had apparently
thought of the commonalty as merely food providers, taxpayers, and a
periodic tribute to Mars. First the King, again at Necker’s urging, a nd
over nobiliar protests, announced that the Third Estate should have as
many deputies and votes, in the coming assembly, as the two other
estates combined. Second, the election was to be by the nearest approach
yet made in France to uni- versal adult suffrage: any male aged
twenty-seven or more, who had paid in the past year any state tax
however small, was eligible to vote for the local assemblies that would
choose the deputies to represent the region in Paris. Third, the King
added to his call a request to all electoral assemblies to submit to him
cahiers, or reports, that would specify the problems and needs of each
class in each district, with recommendations for remedies and re- forms.
Never before, in the memory of Frenchmen, had any of their kings asked
advice of his people.</p>
<p>Of the 6 1 5 cahiers taken to the King by the delegates, 545 survive.
Nearly all of them express their loyalty to him, and even their
affection for him as clearly a man of goodwill; but nearly all propose
that he share his problems and powers with an elected assembly that
would make up with him a con- stitutional monarchy. None mentioned the
divine right of kings. All de- manded trial by jury, privacy of the
mails, moderation of taxes, and reform of the law. The cahiers of the
nobility stipulated that in the coming States- General each of the
orders should sit and vote separately, and no measure should become law
unless approved by all three estates. The cahiers of the clergy called
for an end to religious toleration, and for full and exclusive control
of education by the Church. The cahiers of the Third Estate re- flected,
with diverse emphasis, the demands of the peasants for a reduction of
taxes, abolition of serfdom and feudal dues, universalization of free
edu- cation, the protection of farms from injury by the hunts and
animals of the seigneurs; and the hopes of the middle class for careers
open to talent regard- less of birth, for an end to transport tolls, for
the extension of taxes to the nobility and the clergy; some proposed
that the King should wipe out the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>fiscal deficit by confiscating and selling ecclesiastical property.
The first stages of the Revolution were already outlined in these
cahiers.</p>
<p>In this humble call of a king to his citizens there was a noticeable
devi- ation from impartiality. Whereas outside Paris any man who had
paid a tax was eligible to vote, in Paris only those could vote who had
paid a poll tax of six livres or more. Perhaps the King and his advisers
hesitated to leave to the 500,000 sansculottes the selection of men to
represent in the States- General the best intelligence of the capital;
the democratic problem of quality versus quantity, of getting brains by
counting noses, appeared here on the eve of the Revolution that was, in
1793, to declare for democracy. So the sansculottes were left out of the
legitimate drama, and were led to feel that only through the violent
force of their number could they express their aliquot part of the
general will. They would be heard from, they would be avenged. In 1789
they would take the Bastille; in 1792 they would dethrone the King; in
1793 they would be the government of France.</p>
