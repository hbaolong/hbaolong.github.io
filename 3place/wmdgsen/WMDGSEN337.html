<h4 id="chapter-xxxvii-science-in-the-age-of-copernicus">CHAPTER XXXVII
Science in the Age of Copernicus</h4>
<p>i5!7-65*</p>
<p>I. THE CULT OF THE OCCULT</p>
<p>I T is remarkable that this age, so absorbed in theology and
scholarship, should have produced two men of the highest standing in the
history of science — Copernicus and Vesalius; and curious that the books
that con- tained their lifeblood should have appeared in one annus
mirabilis, 1543. Some conditions favored science. The discovery of
America and the exploration of Asia, the demands of industry and the
extension of commerce, turned up knowledge that often contradicted
traditional beliefs and encouraged fresh thought. Translations from
Greek and Arabic, the printing of Apollonius’s Conics (1537) and the
Greek text of Archimedes ( 1 544) stimulated mathe- matics and physics.
Bur many travelers were liars or careless; printing spreat nonsense more
widely than knowledge; and scientific instruments, though numerous, were
almost primitive. The microscope, the telescope, the ther- mometer, the
barometer, the micrometer, the microchronometer, were still in the
future. The Renaissance was enamored of literature and style, politely
interested in philosophy, almost indifferent to science. The Renaissance
popes were not hostile to science; Leo X and Clement VII listened with
open minds to Copernican ideas, and Paul III received without trembling
the dedication of Copernicus’s world -shaking Book of Revolutions. But
the re- action under Paul IV, the development of the Inquisition in
Italy, and the dogmatic decrees of the Council of Trent made scientific
studies increasingly difficult and dangerous after 1555.</p>
<p>Protestantism could not favor science, for it based itself on an
infallible Bible. Luther rejected the Copnemican astronomy because the
Bible told of Joshua commanding the sun — not the earth — to stand
still. Melanchthon was inclined to science; he studied mathematics,
physics, astronomy, and medi- cine, and lectured on the history of
mathematics in antiquity; but his broad spirit was overwhelmed by the
forceful nature of his master, and by the pre- domina nce of a narrowed
Lutheranism after Luther’s death. Calvin had little use for science;
Knox, none.</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>850</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>A discouraging milieu of occultism continued to surround, confuse,
and sometimes — as in Cardan and Paracelsus — threaten the sanity of the
would-be scientist. Hermetic lore from Egypt, mystical Pythagoreanism
and Neo- platonism from Greece, the Cabala from Judaism, bemused a
thousand grop- ing minds. Legends and miracles infested historiography,
and travelers told of fire-breathing dragons and rope-climbing fakirs.
Almost any unusual event in public or private life was interpreted as
contrived by God or Satan for the warning or edification, the temptation
or ruination, of man. Many believed that comets and meteors were
fireballs hurled by an angry deity. 1 Cheap literature entered every
literate home with assurances that baser metals could be turned into
gold; and (says a contemporary report) “all the tailors, shoemakers,
servants, and maids who hear and read about these things give all the
coins they can spare to… perambulating and fraudulent” practitioners</p>
<p>Perhaps more events were ascribed to Satan than to God. “Scarcely a
year goes by,” lamented a Protestant writer in 1563, “without the most
appalling news from numbers of principalities, towns, and villages, of
the shameless and horrible ways in which the prince of hell, by bodily
apparition and in all sorts of forms, is trying to extinguish the new
and shining light of holy evangel.” 7 Luther joined the commonalty in
attributing most disease s to demons entering the body — which, after
all, is not altogether unlike our cur- rent theory. Many believed that
diseases were caused by the evil eye or other magical means, and that
they could be cured by magic potions — which again is not too far
removed from our present practice. Most remedies were ad- ministered
according to the position of the planets; hence medical students studied
astrology.</p>
<p>Astrology verged on science by assuming a rule of law in the
universe, and operating largely through experiment. The belief that the
movements and positions of the stars determined human events was not
quite as general as before; yet there were 30,000 astrologers in Paris
in the sixteenth century, 8 all ready to cast a horoscope for a coin.
Almanacs of astrological predictions were best sellers; Rabelais
parodied them in the Pantagruelian Prognostica- tions of Master
Alcofribas. Luther and the Sorbonne here agreed with him,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 85 1</p>
<p>and condemned astrology in all its forms. The Church officially
frowned upon astrological predictions, as implying determinism and the
subjection of the Church to the stars; yet Paul III, one of the greatest
minds of the age, “would call no important meeting of the Consistory,”
said an ambassador to the papal court, “and would take no trip, without
choosing his days and ob - serving the constellations.” 9 Francis I,
Catherine de Medicis, Charles IX, Julius II, Leo X, and Adrian VI
consulted astrologers. 10 Melanchthon changed the date of Luther’s birth
to give him a more propitious horoscope, 11 and begged him not to travel
under a new moon. 12</p>
<p>One astrologer of this period is still popular. Nostradamus was, in
French, Michel de Notredame. He professed to be a physician and an
astronomer, and was accepted as semi-official astrologer by Catherine de
Medicis; she built an observatory for him in Les Halles. In 1564 he
predicted a life of ninety years for Charles IX, 13 who died ten years
later at the age of twenty- four. At his own death ( 1 566) he left a
book of prophecies so wisely ambigu- ous that some line or another could
be applied to almost any event in later history.</p>
<p>Because Christians of the sixteenth century believed in the
possibility of obtaining supernatural powers from demons, and because
the fear of demons was ingrained in their rearing, they felt an
obligation to burn witches. Luther and Calvin seconded Pope Innocent
VIII in urging the prosecution of witches. “I would have no compassion
on these witches,” said Luther; “I would bum them all.” 14 Four were
burned at Wittenberg on June 29, 1 540; thirty-four at Geneva in 1 545.
16 The Reformers, of course, had Biblical war- rant for these bonfires,
and Protestant dependence upon the Scriptures gave new urgency to Exodus
22:18. The Catholic practice of exorcism encour- aged the belief in
witchcraft by assuming the power of devils lodged in hu- man beings.
Luther claimed that his Leipzig opponent, Johannes Eck, had signed a
pact with Satan; and Johannes Cochlaeus retorted that Luther was a by-
product of Satan’s dalliance with Margaret Luther. 16</p>
<p>Accusations of witchcraft were sometimes used to get rid of personal
ene- mies. The accused had a choice of prolonged torture to elicit a
confession, or death as the result of a confession; and in
sixteenth-century Europe the administration of torture was systematized
“with a cold -blooded ferocity unknown… t o the heathen nations.” 17
Many victims seem to have believed in their own guilt — that they had
had transactions, sometimes sexual, with devils. 18 Some of the accused
committed suicide; a French judge noted fif- teen such cases within a
year. 19 Secular magistrates often exceeded ecclesias- tics in the
enthusiasm of this persecution. The laws of Henry VIII (1541) punished
with death any of several practices ascribed to witches, 20 but the
Spanish Inquisition branded stories and confessions of witchcraft as
the</p>
<p>852 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>delusions of weak minds, and cautioned its agents ( 1538) to ignore
the popu- lar demand for the burning of witches. 21</p>
<p>Fewer voices were raised to protect witches than in defense of
heretics, and the heretics themselves believed in witches. But in 1563
Johannes Wier, a physician of Cleves, issued a treatise De praestigiis
daemonum (On Demonic Deceptions ) which timidly dared to mitigate the
mania. He did not question the existence of demons, but suggested that
witches were the innocent victims of demonic possession, and were
deluded by the Devil into believing the absurdities that they confessed.
Women, and persons suffering from illness of body or mind, were, he
thought, especially subject to posses- sion by demons. He concluded that
witchcraft was not a crime but a disease, and he appealed to the princes
of Europe to stop the execution of these help- less women. A few years
later Wier replaced himself in his time by writing a detailed
description of hell, its leaders, its organization, and its operation.
The spirit of the age spoke in the story of Faust. We first hear of
Georg Faust in 1 507, in a letter of Johannes Trithemius, who calls him
a mounte- bank; and then in 1513, when Mutianus Rufus accords him no
gentler term. Philip Begardi, a Worms physician, wrote in 1539: “Of late
years a remark - able man has been traveling through nearly every
province, principality, and kingdom… and has boasted highly of his great
skill not only in medicine but in chiromancy, physiognomy, crystal
gazing, and other kindred arts… and has not denied that he is called
Faustus” 22 — i.e., favored or fortunate. The historic Faust seems to
have died in 1539 — by the Devil wringing his neck, said Melanchthon.
Four years later the legend of Faust as in league with the Devil made
its appearance in the Sermones conviviales of Johannes Gast, a
Protestant pastor at Basel. Two old notions combined to transform the
historical charlatan into a figure of legend, drama, and art: that man
might obtain magic powers by compacts with Satan, and that secular
learn- ing is an insolent conceit likely to lead a man to hell. In one
phase the legend was supposed to be a Catholic caricature of Luther; in
a deeper view it ex- pressed the religious repudiation of “profane”
knowledge as opposed to a humble acceptance of the Bible as in itself
sufficient erudition and truth. Goethe repudiated the repudiation, and
allowed the hunger for knowledge to purify itself by its application to
the common good.</p>
<p>The legend of Faust came to bitter life in Henry Cornelius Agrippa.
Born of good family at Cologne (1487), he found his way to Paris, and
fell in there with some mystics or quacks who claimed esoteric wisdom.
Hungry for knowledge and fame, he took up alchemy, studied the Cabala,
and be- came convinced that there was a world of enlightenment
unattainable by ordinary perception or reasoning. He sent to Trithemius
a manuscript De occulta philosophia, with a personal letter:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 853</p>
<p>I wondered much, and indeed felt indignant, that up to this time</p>
<p>no one had arisen to vindicate so sublime and sacred a study from the
accusation of impiety. Thus my spirit was aroused, and… I too con-</p>
<p>ceived the desire to philosophize, thinking that I should produce
a</p>
<p>work not unworthy of praise… if I could vindicate… that ancient</p>
<p>Magic, studied by all the wise, purged and freed from the errors
of</p>
<p>impiety, and endowed with its own reasonable system. 28</p>
<p>Trithemius replied with good counsel:</p>
<p>Speak of things public to the public, but of things lofty and
secret</p>
<p>only to the loftiest and most private of your friends. Hay to an ox
and sugar to a parrot. Rightly interpret this, lest you, as some others
have been, be trampled down by oxen. 24</p>
<p>Whether through caution or lack of a publisher, Agrippa refrained for
twenty years from sending his book through the press. The Emperor Maxi-
milian summoned him to war in Italy; he gave a good account of himself
on the battlefield, but took occasion to lecture on Plato at the
University of Pisa, and to receive degrees in law and medicine at Pavia.
He was appointed town advocate at Metz (1518), and soon lost that
position by interfering with the prosecution of a young woman accused of
witchcraft; he procured her release from the Inquisition, but he thought
it wise then to change his habitat (1519). For two years he served
Louise of Savoy as physician; how- ever, he entered into so many
disputes that she stopped his salary. He moved to Antwerp with his
second wife and his children, was made historiographer and court
librarian to the Regent Margaret of Austria, and managed to eat
regularly. Now he composed his most important work, De incertitudine et
vanitate scientiarum; he published it in 1530, and then, strangely
enough, issued his youthful De occulta philosophia , with a preface
disclaiming con- tinued belief in the mystic abracadabra there detailed.
The two books to- gether offended all the cognizant world.</p>
<p>The Occult Philosophy urged that as the human soul pervades and gov-
erns the body, so the spiritus mundi pervades and governs the universe;
that this great reservoir of soul-force can be tapped by a mind morally
purified and patiently instructed in Magian ways. So reinforced, the
mind can dis- cover the hidden qualities of objects, numbers, letters,
words, can penetrate the secrets of the stars, and can gain mastery over
the forces of the earth and the demons of the air. The book circulated
widely, and its many posthu- mous editions led to legends about
Agrippa’s compact with a devil, who accompanied him in the guise of his
dog, 25 and enabled him to fly over the globe and sleep in the moon.
26</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of life abated Agrippa’s claims on supersensual
experi - ence; he learned that no magic or alchemy could feed his family
or keep him</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>out of jail for debt. He turned in angry disillusionment upon the
pursuit of knowledge, and wrote at the age of thirty-nine On the
Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences, the most skeptical book of the
sixteenth century be- fore Montaigne. “I well perceive,” ran his
exordium, “what a bloody battle I have to fight…. First of all, the
lousy ( pediculose ) grammarians will make a stir, and… peevish poets,
trifle-selling historians, blustering orators, obsti- nate logicians…
fatal astrologers… monstrous magicians… contentious philosophers…” All
knowledge is uncertain, all science is vain, and “to know nothing is the
happiest life.” It was knowledge that destroyed the hap - piness of Adam
and Eve; it was Socrates’s confession of ignorance that brought him
content and fame. “All sciences are only the ordinances and opinions of
men, as injurious as profitable, as pestilent as wholesome, as ill as
good, in no part perfect, but doubtful and full of error and
contention.” 27</p>
<p>Agrippa begins his devastation with the alphabet, and upbraids it for
its bewildering inconsistencies of pronunciation. He laughs at the
grammarians, whose exceptions are more numerous than their rules, and
who are repeat- ed ly outvoted by the people. Poets are madmen; no one
“well in his wits” can write poetry. Most history is a fable; not une
fable convenue, as Voltaire would mistakenly call it, but an
ever-changing fable which each historian and generation transforms anew.
Oratory is the seduction of the mind by eloquence into error. Occultism
is a sham; his own book about it, Agrippa now warns, was “false, or, if
you will, lying”; if formerly he practiced astrol - ogy, magic,
divination, alchemy, and other such “nesciences,” it was mostly through
the importunate solicitation of patrons demanding esoteric knowl- edge,
and able to pay. The Cabala is “nothing else but a pestilent supersti -
tion.” As for the philosophers, the self -canceling diversity of their
opinions puts them out of court; we may leave them to refute one
another. So far as philosophy seeks to deduce morality from reason, it
is stultified by the irra- tional contrariety of morals in place and
time; “whereof it cometh to pass that that which at one time was vice,
another time is accounted virtue, and that which in one place is virtue,
in another is vice.” The arts and occupa - tions are as vitiated as the
sciences with falsehood and vanity. Every court is “a school of corrupt
customs, and a refuge of detestable wickedness.” Trade is treachery.
Treasurers are thieves; their hands are sticky with bird-lime, their
fingers end in hooks. War is the slaughter of many in the sport of the
few. Medicine is “a certain art of manslaughter,” and often “there is
more danger in the physician and the medicine than in the sickness
itself.”</p>
<p>What is the upshot of all this? If science is transient opinion, and
philoso- phy is the vain speculation of mental maggots on the nature of
the infinite, what shall a man live by? Only by the Word of God as
revealed in the Bible. This has an evangelical ring, and indeed,
scattered among Agrippa’s doubts, are sundry affirmations of reform. He
rejects the temporal power of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 855</p>
<p>popes, and even their spiritual authority when this contravenes
Scripture. He denounces the Inquisition as persuading men not with
reason and Scrip- ture but with “fire and faggots.” He wishes the Church
would spend less on cathedrals and more on charity. But he goes beyond
the Reformers when he admits that the authors of the Old and the New
Testament were liable to error. Christ alone is always right and true;
Him only should we trust; in Him is the last refuge of the mind and the
soul.</p>
<p>Agrippa enjoyed the furor caused by his rampage, but he paid for the
pleasure through his remaining years. Charles V demanded that he recant
his criticism of the Church. When he refused, his salary was cut short.
Im- prisoned for debt, he laid responsibility on the Emperor, who was
behind in payments to his court historiographer. Cardinal Campeggio and
the Bishop of Liege secured his release, but Charles banished him from
Imperial ter- ritory (1531). Agrippa moved to Lyons, where, says an
uncertain tradition, he was again imprisoned for debt. Set free, he
passed on to Grenoble; and there, aged forty-eight, he died. Probably he
had a share in forming the skepticism of Montaigne, but his only popular
book was on the occultism that he had renounced. Occult thought and
practices flourished to the end of the century.</p>

<p>Mathematical advances that now seem trivial sharpened the tools of
calcu- lation in this age. Michael Stifel’s Arithm etic a integra (1544)
introduced our plus and minus signs, and Robert Recorde’s Whetstone of
Wit (1557) first used our equals sign in print. The once famous
arithmetics of Adam Riese persuaded Germany to pass from reckoning with
counters to written com- putation. Johannes Werner published (1522) the
first modern treatise on conic sections; and Georg Rheticus, besides
serving as midwife to Coper- nicus, carried on the work of Regiomontanus
in trigonometry.</p>
<p>Astronomy had at its disposal better calculations than instruments.
On the basis of these calculations some astrologers predicted a second
Deluge for February 1 1, 1524, when Jupiter and Saturn would join in
Pisces; thereupon Toulouse built an ark of refuge, and cautious families
stored food on moun- taintops. 28 Most of the astronomical instruments
were of medieval origin: celestial and terrestrial spheres, Jacob’s
staff, an astrolabe, an armillary sphere, quadrants, cylinders, clocks,
compasses, and several other devices, but no telescope and no
photography. With this equipment Copernicus moved the earth.</p>
<p>Mikolai Kopernik, as Poland calls him, Niklas Koppernigk, as Germany
calls him, Nicolaus Copernicus, as scholars call him, was born in 1473
at</p>
<p>856 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>Thorn (Torun) on the Vistula in West Prussia, which, seven years
before, had been ceded to Poland by the Teutonic Knights; he was a
Prussian in space, a Pole in time. His mother came of a prosperous
Prussian family; his father hailed from Cracow, settled in Thorn, and
dealt in copper. When the father died (1483), the mother’s brother,
Lucas Watzelrode, Prince Bishop of Ermland, took charge of the children.
Nicolaus was sent at eighteen to the University of Cracow to prepare for
the priesthood. Not liking the Scholasticism that had there suppressed
humanism, he persuaded his uncle to let him study in Italy. The uncle
had him appointed a canon of the cathe- dral at Frauenburg in Polish
East Prussia, and gave him leave of absence for three years.*</p>
<p>At the University of Bologna (1497-1500) Copernicus studied mathe-
matics, physics, and astronomy. One of his teachers, Domenico de Novara,
once a pupil of Regiomontanus, criticized the Ptolemaic system as
absurdly complex, and introduced his students to ancient Greek
astronomers who had questioned the immobility and central position of
the earth. Philolaus the Pythagorean, in the fifth century before
Christ, had held that the earth and the other planets moved around
Hestia, a central fire invisible to us be- cause all known parts of the
earth are turned away from it. Cicero quoted Hicetas of Syracuse, also
of the fifth century before Christ, as believing that the sun, the moon,
and the stars stood still, and that their apparent motion was due to the
axial rotation of the earth. Archimedes and Plutarch reported that
Aristarchus of Samos (310-230 b.c.) had suggested the revolution of the
earth around the sun, had been accused of impiety, and had withdrawn the
suggestion. According to Plutarch, Seleucus of Babylonia had revived the
idea in the second century before Christ. This heliocentric view might
have triumphed in antiquity had not Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria, in
the second century of our era, restated the geocentric theory with such
force and learning that hardly anyone thereafter dared to challenge it.
Ptolemy him- self had ruled that in seeking to explain phenomena,
science should adopt the simplest possible hypothesis consistent with
accepted observations. Yet Ptolemy, like Hipparchus before him, to
explain the apparent motion of the planets, had been compelled by the
geocentric theory to assume a bewilder- ing complexity of epicycles and
eccentrics, f Could any simpler hypothesis be found? Nicole Oresme
(1330-82) and Nicholas of Cusa (1401-64) had renewed the proposal of
terrestrial motion; Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1 519)</p>

to the priesthood before his later years. In 1537 he was recommended for
a bishopric, which would indicate that he was then a priest. 29</li>

<p>Copernicus felt that the heliocentric theory could “save the
appearances” — explain the observed phenomena — more compactly than the
Ptolemaic view. In 1500, now twenty-seven, he went to Rome, presumably
for the Jubilee, and gave lectures there in which, a tradition reports,
he tentatively propounded the motion of the earth. Meanwhile his leave
of absence expired, and he returned to his duties as canon in
Frauenburg. But geocentric mathe- matics confused his prayers. He begged
permission to resume his studies in Italy, proposing now to take up
medicine and canon law — which to his su- periors seemed more to the
point than astronomy. Before the fifteenth cen- tury ended he was back
in Italy. He received the degree of law at Ferrara (1503), apparently
took no degree in medicine, and again reconciled himself to Frauenburg.
Soon his uncle, probably to give him time for further study,
appropriated him as secretary and physician ( 1 506) ; and for six years
Coper- nicus lived in the episcopal castle at Heilsberg. There he worked
out the basic mathematics of his theory, and formulated it in
manuscript.</p>
<p>When the kindly bishop died, Copernicus resumed his place in Frauen-
burg. He continued to practice medicine, treating the poor without
charge. 31 He represented the cathedral chapter on diplomatic missions,
and prepared for King Sigismund I of Poland a plan for reforming the
Prussian currency. In one of many learned essays on finance he stated
what was later to be known as Gresham’s law: “Bad money… drives the old,
better money away” 32 — i.e., when a government issues a debased
coinage, the good coins are hoarded or exported and disappear from
circulation, the bad coins are offered as taxes, and the king is “paid
in his own coin.” But amid these diverse concerns Copernicus continued
his astronomic researches. His geographical location was unpropitious:
Frauenburg was near the Baltic, and was half the time shrouded in mists
or clouds. He envied Claudius Ptolemy, for whom “the skies were more
cheerful, where the Nile does not breathe fogs as does our Vistula.
Nature has denied us that comfor t, that calm air”; 83 no wonder
Copernicus almost worshiped the sun. His astronomical observations were
neither numerous nor precise, but they were not vital to his purpose. He
used for the most part the astronomic data transmitted by Ptolemy, and
proposed to prove that all received observations accorded best with a
heliocentric view.</p>
<p>About 1514 he summarized his conclusions in a Little Commentary</p>
<p>( Nicolai Copernici de hypothesibus motuum coelestium a se
constitutis commentariolus). It was not printed during his lifetime, but
he sent out some manuscript copies as “trial balloons.” He stated his
conclusions with a mat - ter-of-fact simplicity as if they were not the
greatest revolution in Christian</p>

<p>The few astronomers who saw the Commentariolus paid no great atten-
tion to it. Pope Leo X, informed of the theory, expressed an open-minded
interest, and asked a cardinal to write to Copernicus for a
demonstration of his thesis; for a time the hypothesis won considerable
favor at the enlightened papal court. 35 Luther, toward 1530, rejected
the theory: “People give ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show
that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and
the moon…. This fool wishes to reverse the entire scheme of astronomy;
but sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand
still, not the earth.” 36 Calvin answered</p>
<p>Into this resigned old age burst, in 1539, an enthusiastic young
mathe- matician, Georg Rheticus. He was twenty-five, a Protestant, a
protege of Melanchthon, and a professor at Wittenberg. He had read the
Commentari - olus, he was convinced of its truth, he longed to help the
old astronomer who, far off in an obscure Baltic outpost of
civilization, was waiting so patiently for others to see, with him, the
invisible rotation and revolution of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 859</p>
<p>he earth. The youth fell in love with Cope rnicus, called him “the
best and greatest of men,” and was deeply impressed by his devotion to
science. For ten weeks Rheticus studied the big manuscript. He urged its
publication. Copernicus refused, but agreed to have Rheticus publish a
simplified analysis of its first four books. So in 1540 at Danzig the
young scholar issued his N ctr ratio prima de libris revoliitionum —
First Account of the Books of the Revolutions of the celestial bodies.
He sent a copy hopefully to Melanch- thon. The kindly theologian was not
convinced. When Rheticus returned to Wittenberg (early in 1 540) , and
commended the Copernican hypothesis in his class, he was “ordered,” he
says, to lecture instead on the Sphaera of Johannes de Sacrobosco. 89 On
October 16, 1541, Melanchthon wrote to a friend: “Some think it a
distinguished achievement to construct such a crazy thing as that
Prussian astronomer who moves the earth and fixes the sun. Verily, wise
rulers should tame the unrestraint of men’s minds.” 40</p>
<p>In the summer of 1540 Rheticus went back to Frauenburg, and stayed
till September 1541. Repeatedly he begged his master to give his own
text to the world. When two prominent clergymen joined in the appeal,
Coper- nicus, perhaps feeling that he had now one foot safely in the
grave, yielded. He made some final additions to the manuscript, and
allowed Rheticus to send it to a printer in Nuremberg, who assumed all
financial costs and risks ( 1 542 ). As Rheticus had now left Wittenberg
to teach in Leipzig, he dele- gated to his friend Andreas Osiander, a
Lutheran minister at Nuremberg, the task of seeing the book through the
press.</p>
<p>Osiander had already written to Copernicus (October 20, 1541)
suggest- ing that the new view should be presented as an hypothesis
rather than as proved truth, and in a letter of the same day to Rheticus
he had pointed out that by this procedure “the Aristotelians and the
theologians will easily let themselves be appeased.” 41 Copernicus
himself had repeatedly termed his theories hypotheses, not only in the
Commentariolus but in his major text; 42 at the same time his Dedication
claimed that he had supported his views with “the most transparent
proofs.” We do not know how he answered Osiander. In any case Osiander,
without appending his own name, prefaced the book as follows:</p>
<p>To the reader, concerning the hypotheses of this work.</p>
<p>Many scientists, in view of the already widespread reputation of</p>
<p>hese new hypotheses, will doubtless be greatly shocked by the</p>
<p>heories of this boo k…. However… the master’s… hypotheses</p>
<p>are not necessarily true; they need not even be probable. It is
com-</p>
<p>pletely sufficient if they lead to a computation that is in
accordance</p>
<p>with the astronomical observations…. The astronomer will most</p>
<p>readily follow those hypotheses which are most easily understood.</p>
<p>The philosopher will perhaps demand greater probability; but
neither</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>of the two will be able to discover anything certain… unless it
has</p>
<p>been made known to him by divine revelations. Therefore let us grant
that the following new hypotheses take their place beside the old ones
which are not any more probable. Moreover, these are really admi- rable
and easy to grasp, and in addition we shall find here a great</p>
<p>reasure of the most learned observations. For the rest let no one ex-
pect certainty from astronomy as regards hypotheses. It cannot give this
certainty. He who takes everything that is worked out for other
purposes, as truth, would leave this science probably more ignorant than
when he came to it…. 48</p>
<p>This preface has often been condemned as an insolent interpolation.
44 Coper- nicus may have resented it, for the old man, having lived with
his theory for thirty years, had come to feel it as part of his life and
blood, and as a descrip- tion of the actual facts of the universe. But
Osiander’s preface was judicious and just; it reduced the natural
resistance of many minds to a disturbing and revolutionary idea, and it
is still a good reminder that our descriptions of the universe are the
fallible pronouncements of drops of water about the sea, and are likely
to be rejected or corrected in their turn.</p>
<p>The book appeared at last, in the spring of 1543, with the title,
Nicolai Copernici revolutionum liber primus (First Book of Revolutions);
later the book came to be known as De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (
On the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs). One of the first copies
reached Coper- nicus May 24, 1543. He was on his deathbed. He read the
title page, smiled, and in the same hour died.</p>
<p>The Dedication to Pope Paul III was itself an effort to disarm
resistance to a theory which, as Copernicus well knew, flagrantly
contradicted the letter of Scripture. He began with pious assurances: “I
still believe that we must avoid theories altogether foreign to
orthodoxy.” He had long hesitated to publish, wondering “were it not
better to follow the example of the Pythagoreans… who were accustomed to
transmit the secrets of philoso- phy not in writing but orally, and only
to their relatives and friends.” But learned churchmen — Nicholas
Schonberg, Cardinal of Capua, and Tiedeman Giese, Bishop of Kulm — had
urgently recommended that he should publish his findings. (Copernicus
felt it wise not to mention the Lutheran Rheticus.) He acknowledged his
debt to Greek astronomers, but, by a slip of the pen, he omitted
Aristarchus. He believed that astronomers were in need of a better
theory than the Ptolemaic, for they now found many difficulties in the
geocentric view, and were unable to calculate accurately, on that basis,
the length of the y ear. And he appealed to the Pope, as a man “eminent…
in the love of all learning, and even of mathematics,” to protect him
against the “bites of slanderers” who, without adequate mathematical
knowledge,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 86l</p>
<p>would “assume the right to pass judgment on these things,” or would
“attack</p>
<p>The exposition begins with postulates: first, that the universe is
spherical; second, that the earth is spherical — for matter, left to
itself, gravitates toward</p>
<p>Copernicus notes the relativity of motion: “All change in position
which is seen is due to motion either of the observer or of the thing
looked at, or to changes in the position of both, provided that these
are different. For when things are moved equally relatively to the same
things, no motion is per- ceived as between the object seen and the
observer.” 48 So the apparent daily rotation of the planets about the
earth could be explained as due to a daily rotation of the earth on its
axis; and the apparent annual movement of the sun around the earth can
be explained by supposing the earth to move annu- ally around the
sun.</p>
<p>Copernicus anticipates objections. Ptolemy had argued that the clouds
and surface objects of a rotating earth would fly off and be left
behind. Coper- nicus answers that this objection would hold still more
against the revolution of the major planets around the earth, since
their great distances would imply vast orbits and extreme speeds.
Ptolemy had further held that an ob- ject propelled directly upward from
a rotating earth would not fall back to its point of origin. Copernicus
replies that such objects, like the clouds, are “parts of the earth,”
and are carried along with it. And to the objection that the annual
revolution of the earth around the sun should manifest itself in a
movement of the “fixed” stars (stars beyond our planetary system) as ob
- served at opposite ends of the earth’s orbit, Copernicus answers that
there is such a movement, but the great distance of the stars
(“firmament”) makes it imperceptible to us. (A moderate degree of such
movement is now ob- servable.)</p>
<p>He sums up his system in a compact paragraph:</p>
<p>First and above all lies the sphere of the fixed stars, containing
itself and all things, for that very reason immovable…. Of the
moving</p>
<p>bodies [planets] first comes Saturn, who completes his circuit in
thirty years. After him Jupiter, moving in a twelve-year revolution.
Then</p>
<p>Mars, who revolves biennially. Fourth in order, an annual cycle takes
place, in which… is contained the earth, with the lunar orbit as an</p>
<p>epicycle. In the fifth place Venus is carried round in nine
months.</p>
<p>Then Mercury holds the sixth place, circulating in the space of

<p>days. In the middle of all dwells the sun…. Not ineptly some call
it</p>
<p>he lamp of the universe, others its mind, and others again its
ruler</p>
<p>… rightly, inasmuch as the sun, sitting on a royal throne, governs
the</p>
<p>circumambient family of the stars We find, therefore, under this</p>
<p>orderly arrangement, a wonderful symmetry in the universe, and a</p>
<p>definite relation of harmony in the motion and magnitude of the orbs,
of a kind it is not possible to obtain in any other way.* 47</p>
<p>Generally an advance in human theory carries with it many remnants of
the theory displaced. Copernicus based his conceptions on observations
handed down by Ptolemy, and he retained much of the Ptolemaic celestial
machinery of spheres, epicycles, and eccentrics; the rejection of these
would wait for Kepler. Most eccentric of all was Copernicus’s
calculation that the sun was not quite at the center of the earth’s orbi
t. The center of the uni- verse, he reckoned, would be “three sun -
diameters away from the sun”; and the centers of the planetary orbits
were likewise outside the sun, and not at all identical. Copernicus
transferred from the earth to the sun two ideas now rejected: that the
sun is the approximate center of the universe, and that it is at rest.
He thought of the earth as having not only an axial rotation and an
orbital revolution, but a third motion, which he supposed necessary to
ex- plain the inclination of the earth’s axis and the precession of the
equinoxes.</p>
<p>Consequently we must not smile in hindsight at those who took so long
to adopt the Copemican system. They were required not only to set the
earth turning and hurtling in space at an alarming speed, contrary to
the direct evidence of the senses, but to accept a mathematical maze
only slightly less bewildering than Ptolemy’s. Not until Kepler,
Galileo, and Newton should work out the mechanism of the new theory to
greater simplicity and accu- racy would it appear clearly superior to
the old; and even then we should have to say of the sun what Galileo may
have said of the earth — eppur si muove. Meanwhile Tycho Brahe rejected
the heliocentric hypothesis on the ground that C opernicus had not
convincingly answered Ptolemy’s objec - tions. More surprising than such
a rejection is the relative celerity with which the new system was
accepted by astronomers like Rheticus, Osiander, John Field, Thomas
Digges, and Erasmus Reinhold — whose “Prutenic Tables” (1551) of
celestial motions was in large part based on Copernicus. The Catholic
Church raised no objection to the new theory so long as it represented
itself as an hypothesis; but the Inquisition struck back merci- lessly
when Giordano Bruno assumed the hypothesis to be a certainty, and made
explicit its consequences for religion. In 1616 the Congregation of the
Index forbade the reading of De Revolutionibus “until corrected”; in
1620</p>
<p>Current astronomy supposes nine planets and periods of revolution:
Mercury (88 days), Venus (225), earth (365.26), Mars (687), Jupiter
(11.86 years), Saturn (26.46 years), Uranus (84.02 years), Neptune
(164.79 years), and Pluto (248 years).</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 863</p>
<p>it allowed Catholics to read editions from which nine sentences had
been removed that represented the theory to be a fact. The book
disappeared from the revised Index of 1758, but the prohibition was not
explicitly re- scinded till 1828.</p>
<p>The geocentric theory had fitted reasonably well a theology which
sup- posed that all things had been created for the use of man. But now
men felt tossed about on a minor planet whose history was reduced to a
“mer e local item in the news of the universe.” 48 What could “heaven”
mean when “up” and “down” had lost all sense, when each would become the
other in half a day? “No attack on Christianity,” wrote Jerome Wolf to
Tycho Brahe in 1575, “is more dangerous than the infinite size and depth
of the heavens”— though Copernicus had not taught the infinity of the
universe. When men stopped to ponder the implications of the new system
they must have won- dered at the assumption that the Creator of this
immense and orderly cosmos had sent His Son to die on this middling
planet. All the lovely poetry of Chris- tianity seemed to “go up in
smoke” (as Goethe was to put it) at the touch of the Polish clergyman.
The heliocentric astronomy compelled men to re- conceive God in less
provincial, less anthropomorphic terms; it gave theology the strongest
challenge in the history of religion. Hence the Copernican revo- lution
was far profounder than the Reformation; it made the differences be-
tween Catholic and Protestant dogmas seem trivial; it pointed beyond the
Reformation to the Enlightenment, from Erasmus and Luther to Voltaire,
and even beyond Voltaire to the pessimistic agnosticism of a nineteenth
cen- tury that would add the Darwinian to the Copernican catastrophe.
There was but one protection against such men, and that was that only a
small minority in any generation would recognize the implications of
their thought. The sun will “rise” and “set” when Copernicus has been
forgotten.</p>
<p>In 1 58 1 Bishop Kromer raised a monument to Copernicus against the
inner wall of Frauenburg Cathedral, next to the canon’s grave. In 1746
the monu - ment was removed to make place for a statue of Bishop
Szembek. Who was he? Who knows?</p>

<li>MAGELLAN AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE EARTH</li>
</ol>
<p>The exploration of the earth progressed more rapidly than the
charting of the skies, and with almost as disturbing influences on
religion and philoso- phy. Geology advanced least, for the Biblical
theory of creation was put be- yond question by belief in its divine
authorship. “If a wrong opinion should obtain regarding the creation as
described in Genesis,” said the Italian - English reformer, Peter Martyr
Vermigli, “all the promises of Christ fall into nothing, and all the
life of our religion would be lost.” 49 Aside from Leo -</p>
<p>864 the reformation (chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>nardo’s scattered suggestions, the most significant work in geology
in the first half of the sixteenth century was done by Georg Agricola.
Note this passage from De ortu et causis subterraneorum (Basel, 1 546)
on the origin of mountains:</p>
<p>Hills and mountains are produced by two forces, one of which is</p>
<p>he power of water, tire other the strength of the wind; we must add
the fire in the interior of the earth…. For the torrents first of all
wash out the soft earth, next carry away the harder earth, and then
roll</p>
<p>down the rocks, and thus in a few years they excavate the plains
or</p>
<p>slopes…. By such excavation to a great depth through many ages</p>
<p>here arises an immense eminence…. Streams… and rivers effect the same
result by their rushing and washing; for this reason they are</p>
<p>frequently seen flowing either between very high mountains, which
they have created, or close by the shore which borders them….</p>
<p>The wind produces hills and mountains in two ways: either… it</p>
<p>violently moves and agitates the sand, or also when, after having
been driven into the hidden recesses of the earth… it struggles to
burst</p>
<p>out. 50</p>
<p>Agricola’s De natura fossilium (1546) was the first systematic
treatise on mineralogy; his De re metallica included the first
systematic stratigraphy, and gave, as we have seen, the first
explanation of ore deposits.</p>
<p>Ethnography produced two major works: the Cosmographia universalis
(1544) of Sebastian Munster, and the Descriptio Africae (1550) of “Leo
Africanus.” Al -Hasan ibn-Muhammad al-Wazzan was a Moor from Gra- nada;
he traveled through Africa, and south to the Sudan, with the avidity of
Ibn-Batuta; he was captured by Christian pirates and sent to Rome as a
present to Leo X, who, impressed by his scholarly attainments, freed and
pensioned him. He responded by accepting Christianity and Leo’s name.
During the next thirty years he composed his book, first in Arabic, then
in Italian. Before it came from the press he returned to Tunis; and
there he died in 1 552, apparently in the faith of his fathers. 51</p>
<p>It was an exciting age for geography. Reports poured in from
missionaries, conquistador es, navigators, travelers, adding immensely
to Europe’s knowl - edge of the globe. The Spanish who in this period
conquered Mexico, Cali- fornia, Central America, and Peru were first of
all adventurers, tired of poverty and routine at home, and facing with
pleasure the perils of distant and alien lands. Amid the hardships of
their reckless enterprise they forgot civilized restraints, frankly
adopted the morality of superior guns, and ac- complished an act of
continental robbery, treachery, and murder forgivable only because here
and there — if an interested party may judge — the ultimate result was a
gain for civilization. Yet there is little doubt that the conquered were
at the time more civilized than their actual conquerors. Think of
the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 865</p>
<p>Mayan culture found in Yucatan by Hernandez de Cordova (1517), and
the Aztec Empire of the Montezumas conquered by Hernando Cortes (1521),
and the socialistic civil ization of the Incas destroyed in Francisco
Pizarro’s conquest of Peru (1526-32). We cannot know into what forms,
noble or ignoble, these civilizations would have developed had they
possessed the weapons to defend themselves.</p>
<p>TTie geographical revelation proceeded. Sebastian Cabot, under a
Spanish flag, explored Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. De Soto crossed
Florida and the Gulf States into Oklahoma. Pedro de Alvarado discovered
the em- pire of Texas, and Francisco de Coronado moved through Arizona
and Oklahoma to Kansas. The mines of Potosi in Bolivia began to send
their silver to Spain (1545). Year by year the map of the New World was
charted in gold, silver, and blood. The English and French lagged behind
in the great raid, because those parts of North America which the
Spanish and Portu- guese left to them were poor in precious metals, and
forbidding in forests. John Rut sailed along the coast of Newfoundland
and Maine. Giovanni da Verrazano was sent by Francis I to find a
northwest passage to Asia; he landed on North Carolina, entered New York
harbor (which remembers him with a statue at the Battery), and rounded
Cape Cod to Maine. Jacques Cartier, under the flag of France, sailed up
the St. Lawrence to Montreal, and established a French claim to
Canada.</p>
<p>The most impressive adventure in this second generation of
transoceanic exploration was the circling of the globe. Femao de
Magalhaes was a Portu- guese who shared actively in many Portuguese
voyages and forays, but, fall- ing into disfavor with his government, he
passed into the service of Spain. In 1 5 1 8 he persuaded Charles I (V)
to finance an expedition that would seek a southwest passage to Asia.
The young King was not yet rich, and the five ships allotted to Magellan
were so weatherbeaten that one captain pro- nounced them unseaworthy.
The largest was of 120 tons burden, the small- est, of seventy-five.
Experienced sailors were loath to enlist; the crews had to be made up in
large part of water-front riffraff. On September 20, 1519, the fleet
sailed out of the Guadalquivir at San Lucar. It had the advantage of
sailing from summer in the North Atlantic into summer in the South At-
lantic; but in March 1520, winter came, and the vessels were anchored
while the crews spent five weary months in Patagonia. The giant natives,
averag- ing over six feet in height, gave the comparatively short
Spaniards a con- descending friendliness; nevertheless the hardships
were so endless that three of the five crews mutinied, and Magellan had
to wage war against his own men to compel their continuance in the
enterprise. One ship stole away and returned to Spain; another was
shattered on a reef. In August 1520, the voyage was resumed, and every
bay was eagerly looked into as possibly the mouth of a transcontinental
waterway. Or November 28 the search sue-</p>

<p>ceeded; the reduced fleet entered the Straits that bear Magellan’s
name. Thirty-eight days were spent in the 320-mile passage from sea to
sea. Then began a dreary crossing of the seemingly endless Pacific. In
ninety- eight days only two small islands were seen. Provisions ran
dangerously low, and scurvy plagued the crews. On March 6, 1521, they
touched at Guam, but the natives were so hostile that Magellan sailed
on. On April 6 they reached the Philippines; on the seventh they landed
on the island of Cebu. There Magellan, to assure supplies, agreed to
support the local ruler against neighboring enemies. He took part in an
expedition against the island of Mactan, and was killed in battle there
on April 27, 152 1. He did not circum- navigate the globe, but he was
the first to realize Columbus’ dream of reach - ing Asia by sailing
west. 62</p>
<p>The crews were now so reduced by death that they could man only two
ships. One of these turned back across the Pacific, probably seeking
American gold. Only the Victoria remained. Juan Sebastian del Cano took
command, and guided the little vessel, of eighty-five tons burden,
through the Spice Islands, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of
Good Hope, and up the west coast of Africa. Hungry for supplies, the
crew anchored the ship off one of the Cape Verde Islands, but they were
attacked by the Portu- guese, and half of them were jailed. The
remaining twenty-two managed to get away; and on September 8, 1522, the
Victoria sailed up to Seville, with only eighteen men (the rest were
Malays) of the 280 who had set out from Spain almost three years before.
The ship’s log recorded the date as Septem - ber 7; Cardinal Gasparo
Contarini explained the discrepancy as due to the westward direction of
the voyage. The enterprise was one of the bravest in history, and one of
the most fruitful for geography.</p>
<p>It remained for the geographers to catch up with the explorers. Giam-
battista Ramusio, the Italian Hakluyt, made the task easier by
collecting, through thirty years, the accounts brought home by voyagers
and</p>
<p>other travelers; he translated and edited them, and they were
published in three volumes (1550-59), thirteen years after his death.
The progress made by the geographers in a decade becomes visible in
comparing the 1520 globe preserved in the Germanisches National Museum

and skips over a narrow ocean to Asia — with the three maps drawn up ( 1
527-29) by Diogo Ribeiro, which show the coasts of Europe, Africa, and
southern Asia with great ac- curacy, the east coast of the Americas from
Newfoundland to the Straits of Magellan, and the west coast from Peru to
Mexico. Probably copied from Ribeiro is the beautiful “Ramusio Map”
(Venice, 1534) of the Americas in the New York Public Library. In the
same alma mater is an early and faulty map by Gerhadus Mercator (1538),
in which North and South America were first so named. (“Mercator’s

<p>The effects of these explorations were felt in every phase of
European life. The voyages of 1420-1560 nearly quadrupled the known
surface of the globe. New fauna and flora, gems and minerals, foods and
drugs, enlarged the botany, zoology, geology, menu, and pharmacopoeia of
Europe. People wondered how representatives of all the new species had
found room in Noah’s ark. Literature was transformed: the old tales of
chivalry gave way to stories of travel or adventure in distant lands;
the search for gold replaced the quest of the Holy Grail in unconscious
symbolism of the modern mood. The greatest commercial revolution in
history (before the maturing of the airplane) opened the Atlantic and
other oceans to European trade, and left the Mediterranean in a
commercial — soon, therefore, in a cultural — back- water; the
Renaissance moved from Italy to the Atlantic states. Europe, pos-
sessing better ships and guns, a hardier, more acquisitive and
adventurous population, conquered — sometimes colonized — one after
another of the newly discovered lands. Native populations were put to
unwontedly steady and arduous work producing goods for Europe; slavery
became an established institution. The almost-smallest continent became
the richest; that European- ization of the globe began which has been so
sharply reversed in our time. The mind of Western man was powerfully
stimulated by the distance, im- mensity, and variety of the new lands.
Part of Montaigne’s skepticism would root in the fascination of exotic
ways and faiths. Customs and morals took on a geographical relativity
that sapped old dogmas and certainties. Christianity itself had to be
viewed in a new perspective as the religion of a minor conti- nent amid
a world of rival creeds. As humanism had discovered a world be- fore
Christ, and Copernicus had exposed the astronomic insignificance of the
earth, so exploration and the commerce that followed it revealed vast
realms beyond and ignoring Christianity. The authority of Aristotle and
the other Greeks was damaged when it appeared how little of the planet
they had known. The Renaissance idolatry of the Greeks declined, and
man, swelling with Renaissance pride at his new discoveries, prepared to
forget his lessened astronomic size in the expansion of his knowledge
and his trade. Modern science and philosophy rose, and undertook the
epochal task of reconceiving the world.</p>

<li>THE RESURRECTION OF BIOLOGY</li>
</ol>
<p>The biological sciences, which had made hardly any progress since the
Greeks, now came back to life. Botany struggled to free itself from
phar- macy and stand on its own feet; it succeeded, but inevitably its
masters were still medical men. Otto Brunfels, city physician at Bern,
began the move-</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>ment with his Herbarum vivae icones ( 1530-36) —“living pictures oi
plants”; its text was largely filched from Theophrastus, Dioscorides,
and other prede- cessors, but it also described the native plants of
Germany, and its 1 3 5 wood- cuts were models of fidelity. Euricius
Cordus, city physician to Bremen, set up the first botanical garden
(1530) north of the Alps, attempted an inde- pendent summary of the
nascent science in his Botanilogicon (1534), and hen returned to his
medical medium in his Liber de minis. His son Valerius Cordus wandered
recklessly in the study of plants, met his death in the search at the
age of twenty-nine ( 1 544) , but left for posthumous publication his
Historia plantarum, which vividly and accurately described 500 new
species. Leonard Fuchs, professor of medicine at Tubingen, studied
botany at first for pharmaceutics, then for its own sake and delight.
His Historia stirpium (1542) was typical of scientific devotion; its 343
chapters analyzed 343 genera, and illustrated them with 5 1 5 woodcuts,
each occupying a full folio page. He prepared a still more comprehensive
work with 1,500 plates, but no printer would undertake the expense of
its publication. The genus Fuchsia is his living memorial.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important single idea contributed to biology in this
period was Pierre Belon’s demonstration, in his Histoire… des oyseaux
(1555), °f the astonishing correspondence of the bones in men and birds.
But the greatest fig ure in the “natural science” of this age was Conrad
Ges - ner, whose work and learning covered so wide a field that Cuvier
called him the Pliny, and might have called him the Aristotle, of
Germany. Born of a poor family in Zurich (1516), he showed such aptitude
and industry that the city joined with private patrons to finance his
higher education in Stras- bourg, Bourges, Paris, and Basel. He made or
collected 1,500 drawings to illustrate his Historia plantarum, but this
work proved so expensive to print that it did not emerge from manuscript
till 1 7 5 1 ; its brilliant classification of plant genera by their
reproductive structures reached the light too late to help Linnaeus. He
published during his lifetime four volumes (1551-58), and left a fifth,
of a gigantic Historia animalium, which listed each animal species under
its Latin name, and described its appearance, origin, habitat, habits,
illnesses, mental and emotional qualities, medical and domestic uses,
and place in literature; the classification was alphabetical instead of
scientific, but its encyclopedic accumulation of knowledge invited
biology to take form. Insufficiently used up by these labors, Gesner
began a twenty-one- volume Bibliotheca universalis, in which he set out
to catalogue all known Greek, Latin, and Hebrew writings; he completed
twenty volumes, and earned the title of Father of Bibliography. In an
aside called Mithridates (1555) he attempted to classify 130 languages
of the world. His Descriptio Montis Pilati (1541) was apparently the
first published study of mountains as forms of beauty; Switzerland now
knew that it was majestic. All these</p>
<p>CHAV. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 869</p>
<p>enterprises were accomplished between 1541 and 1565. In that year
Conrad Gesner, the incarnate spirit of study, died.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Juan Vives’s De anima et vita (1538) almost created modern
empirical psychology. As if to elude the skepticism that Hume would ex-
pound two centuries later about the existence of a “mind” additional to
mental operations, Vives advised the student not to ask what the mind or
soul is, since (he felt) we shall never know this; we must inquire only
what the mind does; psychology must cease to be theoretical metaphysics
and must become a science based on specific and accumulated
observations. Here Vives anticipated by a century Francis Bacon’s
emphasis on induction. He studied in detail the association of ideas,
the operation and improvement of memory, the process of knowledge, and
the role of feeling and emotion. In his book we see psychology, like so
many sciences before it, emerging painfully from the womb of their
common mother, philosophy.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>VESALIUS</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published what Sir William Osier judged the
greatest medical work ever written. r ‘ 8 His father, Andreas Wessel,
was a prosperous apothecary in Brussels; his grandfather had been
physician to Mary of Burgundy and then to her husband Maximilian I; his
great-grand- father had been city physician at Brussels; his
great-great-grandfather, a physician, had composed a commentary on
Avicenna’s Kanun; here was a social heredity outmatching Bach’s.
Subjected to it from birth, Vesalius soon developed a p assion for
dissection. “No animal was safe from him. Dogs and cats, mice, rats, and
moles were meticulously dissected by him.” 54 But he did not neglect
other studies. At twenty-two he lectured in Latin, and read- ily read
Greek. At Paris (1533-36) he studied anatomy under Jacques Dubois, who
gave to many muscles and blood vessels the names they bear today. For a
long time, like his teachers, he accepted Galen as a Bible; he never
lost respect for him, but he respected much more the authority of ob-
servation and dissection. With some fellow students he made many trips
to the charnel houses where were gathered the bones exhumed from the
Ceme- tery of the Innocents; there they became so familiar with the
parts of the human skeleton that, he tells us , “we, even blindfolded,
dared at times to wager with our companions, and in the space of half an
hour no bone could be offered us.. , which we could not identify by
touch.” 55 Frequently, in the classes of Dubois, the bold young
anatomist would displ ace the “barber surgeons” to whom actual
dissection was usually delegated by the physician professor, and would
himself expertly expose the parts relevant to the lec- ture. 56</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>When his sovereign Charles V invaded France (1536), Vesalius retired
to Louvain. Hampered by a shortage of corpses there, he and his friend
Gemma Frisius (later famous as a mathematician) snatched one out of the
air. His account reveals his passion:</p>
<p>While out walking, looking for bones in the place where, on the</p>
<p>country highways… those who have been executed are customarily</p>
<p>placed, I happened upon a dried cadaver The bones were entirely</p>
<p>bare, held together by the ligaments alone…. With the help of</p>
<p>Gemma I climbed the stake and pulled off the femur The scapulae</p>
<p>ogether with the arms and hands followed…. After I had brought</p>
<p>he legs and arms home in secret and successive trips… I allowed</p>
<p>myself to be shut out of the city in the evening in order to
obtain</p>
<p>he thorax, which was firmly held by a chain. 1 was burning with
so</p>
<p>great a desire…. The next day I transported the bones home piece-
meal through another gate of the city. 57</p>
<p>The burgomaster saw the point, and thereafter gave the anatomy
classes whatever cadaver could be released; “and he himself,” says
Vesalius, “was in regular attendance when I administered an anatomy.”
58</p>
<p>A man with such “burning desire” could not keep his temper cool. He
fell into a hot dispute with a teacher about methods of venesection,
left Louvain (1537), and rode down the Rhine and across the Alps to
Italy. He was al- ready so proficient that before the end of that year
he received his doctor’s degree at Padua cum ultima diminutione — ’with
the maximum diminution” of the fee; for the higher a student’s standing
the lower his graduation fee. On the very next day (December 6, 1537)
the Venetian Senate appointed him professor of surgery and anatomy at
the University of Padua. He was twenty-three.</p>
<p>During the following six years he taught at Padua, Bologna, and Pisa,
do- ing hundreds of dissections with his own hands, and issuing some
minor works. Under his direction Jan Stefan van Kalkar, a pupil of
Titian, drew six plates which were published (1538) as Tabulae anatomic
ae sex. A year later Vesalius, in a V enesection Letter, supported
Pierre Brissot of Paris on methods of bloodletting. In the course of his
argument he revealed some results of his dissections of the venous
system, and these observations con- tributed to the discovery of the
circulation of the blood. In 1541-42 he joined other scholars in a new
edition of the Greek text of Galen. He was astonished by Galenic errors
that the simplest human dissection would have disproved — that the lower
jaw had two parts, the sternum seven distinct bones, the liver several
lobes. Only on the assumption that Galen’s dissec - tions had been of
animals, never of men, could these errors be explained and forgiven.
Vesalius felt that the time had come to revise the science of human
anatomy in terms of the dissection of man. He prepared his
masterpiece.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 871</p>
<p>When Johannes Oporinus printed at Basel in 1543 the De humani
corporis fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body), a large folio of
663 pages, what must have struck the reader at once was the title page —
an engraving worthy of Diirer, which pictured Vesalius demonstrating the
anatomy of an opened arm, with half a hundred students looking on. And
then the illus- trations: 277 woodcuts of unprecedented anatomical
accuracy and high technical excellence, made mostly by Van Kalkar, with
scientifically ir- relevant and artistically attractive landscapes
behind the figures — a skeleton, for example, at a reading desk. These
cuts were so fine that some have thought they were designed in the
studio of Titian, perhaps under his super- vision; to which we must add
that Vesalius drew several of them with his own hand. He accompanied the
blocks watchfully in their journey by mule pack over the Alps from
Venice to Basel. When the printing was complete the blocks were
carefully preserved; later they were bought, exchanged, and lost; in
1893 they were found secreted in the library of the University of
Munich; they were destroyed by bombing in the second World War.</p>
<p>What should have aroused more astonishment than these drawings was
that the text — a triumph of typography but also a scientific revolution
— was by a youth of twenty-nine. It was a revolution because it ended
the reign of Galen in anatomy, revised the whole science in terms of
dissection, and so established the physical basis of modern medicine,
which begins with this book. Here for the first time were described the
true course of the veins and the anatomy of the heart; here was the
epochal statement that the most care- ful dissection showed none of
those pores through which Galen had sup- posed the blood to pass from
one ventricle of the heart to the other; so the way was prepared for
Servetus, Colombo, and Harvey. Galen was corrected again and again — on
the fiver, the bile ducts, the maxillae, the uterus. Vesalius, too, made
errors, even of observation, and failed to take the great leap from the
anatomy of the heart to the circulation of the blood. But here were ac-
curate descriptions of scores of organs never so well described before,
and every part of the body opened to science with a confident and
masterly hand. He suffered from the defects of his qualities. The pride
that upheld him through years of minute study made him quick to take
offense, slow to recog- nize the achievements of his predecessors and
the sensitivity of his rivals. He was so in love with “that true Bible…
the human body and the nature of man” 59 that he hurt many theological
toes. He referred sarcastically to the ecclesiastics who seemed most
attracted to his lecture room when the re- productive organs were to be
studied and shown. 60 He made many enemies; and though Gesner and
Fallopio hailed his work, most of the older professors, including his
former teacher Dubois, condemned him as an insolent upstart, and
sedulously picked flaws in his book. Dubois explained that Galen had not
been wrong, but that the human body had changed since Galen’s time;
so.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>872</p>
<p>(chap, xxxvn</p>
<p>he thought, the straight thigh bones, which, as everyone saw, were
not curved in accordance with Galen’s descr iption of them, were the
result of the narrow trousers of Renaissance Europeans. 61</p>
<p>In a tempest of disappointment at the attitude of these men, Vesalius
burned a huge volume of Annotationes, and a paraphrase of the ten books
of al- Razi’s Kitab al -Mansuri — in encyclopedia of medicine. 62 In
1544 he left Italy to become second physician on the staff of Charles V,
to whom he had judiciously dedicated the Fabrica. In the same year his
father died, leaving him a considerable fortune. He married, and built a
handsome home in Brussels. A second edition of the Fabrica was issued in
1555, with augmented and corrected text. It showed that artificial
respiration could keep an animal alive despite incision of its chest,
and that a stopped heart could sometimes be revived by bellows.
Thereafter Vesalius made no contribution to anat- omy. He absorbed
himself in caring for his Imperial and lesser patients, and in the
practice and study of surgery. When Charles abdicated, Vesalius be- came
second physician to Philip II. In July 1559, the King sent him to aid
Ambroise Pare in an attempt to save the wounded Henry II; Vesalius ap-
plied clinical tests that showed no possibility of recovery. Later in
that year he and his family accompanied Philip to Spain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile others advanced anatomy. Giambattista Cano noted the venous
valves (1547); Servetus explained the pulmonary circulation of the blood
( 1 553 );Realdo Colombo made the same discovery (1558), and proved it
by experiment on the living heart; but another seventy years passed
before Har- vey’s epochal description of the course of the blood from
heart to lungs to heart to arteries to veins to heart. The Arab
physician Ibn al-Nafis had an- ticipated Servetus in 1 2 8 5 , 63 and
the tradition of his doctrine may have carried down into the Spain of
Servetus’s youth.</p>
<p>Vesalius had some adventures left to him. The native physicians at
the Spanish court made it a point of honor to disregard his diagnoses.
When Don Carlos, Philip’s only son, suffered concussion of the brain
from a fall (1562), Vesalius recommended trepanning. The advice was
rejected, and the youth neared death. Relics and charms were applied to
the wound, and pious people flogged themselves to persuade heaven to
effect some miracu- lous cure; to no avail. Finally Vesalius insisted on
opening the skull; it was done, and a large quantity of pus was drawn
off. The Prince soon improved, and eight days after the operation Philip
II attended a solemn procession of thanksgiving to God. 64</p>
<p>Two years later Vesalius left Spain, for reasons still in dispute.
Ambroise Pare told of an anatomist who brought most of Spain down upon
his head by opening the body of a woman supposedly dead from
“strangulation of the uterus”; at a further stroke of the surgeon’s
knife, said Pare, the woman came suddenly back to life, “which struck
such admiration and horror into</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 873</p>
<p>he hearts of all her friends… that they accounted the physician —
before of good fame and report- as infamous and detestable”; 65
relatives do not always appreciate such unexpected recoveries.
“Therefore,” continued the Hu - guen ot surgeon, “he thought there was
no better way for him, if he would live safe, than to forsake the
country.” Hubert Languet, another Hugue - not, told a similar story (
c. 1579), named the physician as Vesalius, and claimed that Vesalius, by
dissecting a living person, had become liable to the Inquisition, which
he escaped by promising to make a penitential pilgrimage to Palestine.
No contemporary source mentions the incident, and Catholic historians
reject it as a fable. 66 Perhaps Vesalius was just tired of Spain.</p>
<p>He returned to Italy, sailed from Venice (April 1564), and apparently
reached Jerusalem. On the way back he suffered shipwreck, and died of
ex- posure, far from any friend, on the island of Zante off the west
coast of Greece (October 15,1 564). He was fifty years old. In that same
year Michel- angelo died and Shakespeare was born. The splendor that had
shone for a century in Italy was passing to the north.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF SURGERY</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the advances of anatomy, the science and art of medicine were
still in leading strings to Greek and Arabic authorities. The evidence
of the senses hardly availed against the word of Galen or Avicenna; even
Vesalius, when his dissections disproved Galen, said, “I could hardly
believe my eyes.” Edi - tions or translations of Galen or Hippocrates,
while spreading old knowl- edge, discouraged new experiments — very much
as the efforts of Petrarch and Ronsard to write Virgilian epics diverted
and injured their natural genius. When Linacre founded what was later
named the Royal College of Physicians (1518), its principal texts were
his translations of Galen.</p>
<p>Therapy benefited from new drugs brought to Europe — cinchona, ipe-
cacuanha, and rhubarb from America, ginger and benzoin from Sumatra,
cloves from the Moluccas, aloes from Cochin China, camphor and cinnabar
from China; and the development widened the use of native plants.
Valerius Cordus compiled the first German pharmacopoeia (1546). The
treatment of syphilis with infusions of guaiac wood from the West Indies
was so popu- lar that the Fuggers made another fortune by securing from
their debtor, Jharles V, a monopoly on its sale in his realms.</p>
<p>The poverty and uncleanliness of the masses kept diseases always
ahead of cures. Open heaps of refuse or dung poisoned the air, and
sometimes littered the streets. Paris had a system of sewers, which
Henry II proposed to empty into the Seine; the municipal authorities
dissuaded him by explaining that the river was the sole drinking water
that half the people had. 67 Sewer com-</p>
<p>874 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>missions were set up in England in 1532, but as late as 1844 there
were only two English towns where refuse was removed at public expense
from the slums.</p>
<p>Epidemics were less virulent than in the Middle Ages, but they
sufficed — along with high puerperal and infantile mortality, to keep
the population almost stationary. Plagues swept through Germany and
France repeatedly between 1500 and 1568. Typhus fever spread in England
in 1422, 1577, and 1586, through the migrations of lice. The “sweating
sickness”— probably a form of influenza — ravaged England in 1528, 1529,
1551, 1578; Germany in 1543-45; France in 1550-51; Hamburg and Aachen,
we are told, each lost a thousand souls to it within a few days. 68
Influenza was ascribed to celestial influences — hence its name. The
bubonic plague reappeared in Germany in 1562, taking 9,000 of the 40,000
inhabitants of Nuremberg 69 — though we may suspect all plague
statistics as exaggerations. Brighter sides of the picture are the
fading out of leprosy and such mental disorders as St. Vitus’s
Dance.</p>
<p>Medical practice progressed more slowly than medical knowledge.
Quacks still abounded; despite some restrictive laws it was easy to
practice medicine without a degree. Most babies were eased into the
world by midwives. Specialism had hardly begun. Dentistry was not
separated from medicine or surgery; barber surgeons extracted teeth, and
replaced them with ivory substitutes. Nearly all physicians — Vesalius
was one of the exceptions — left surgery to barber surgeons, who,
however, must not be thought of as bar- bers; many of them were men of
training and skill.</p>
<p>Ambroise Pare began as a barber’s apprentice, and r ose to be surgeon
to kings. Born (1517) at Bourg-Hersent in Maine, he made his way to
Paris, and set up his barber’s stall in the Place St. -Michel. During
the war of 1536 he served as a regimental surgeon. In treating soldiers
he accepted the pre- vailing theory that gunshot wounds were poisonous,
and (like Vesalius) he followed the current practice of cauterizing them
with boiling elder oil, which turned pain into agony. One night the oil
ran out, and for lack of it Pare dressed the wounds with a salve of egg
yolk, attar of roses, and turpen- tine. On the morrow he wrote:</p>
<p>Last night I could hardly sleep for continually thinking about
the</p>
<p>wounded men whose hurts I had not been able to cauterize. I expected
to find them all dead the next morning. With this in view I rose early
to visit them. Greatly to my surprise, I found that those whom I had
treated with the salve had very little pain in their wounds, no inflam-
mation… and had passed a comfortable night. The others, whose</p>
<p>wounds had been treated with boiling elder oil, were in high
fever,</p>
<p>while their wounds were inflamed… and acutely painful. I deter-</p>
<p>mined, therefore, that I would no longer cauterize the
unfortunate</p>
<p>in so cruel a manner. 70</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 875</p>
<p>Pare had little education, and it was not till 1 545 that he
published his little manual, now a medical classic, on the treatment of
wounds (Methode de tr aider les plaies). In the war of 1552 he proved
that ligature of the artery was preferable to cauterization to check
bleeding in amputations. Captured by the enemy, he earned his release by
successful operations. On returning to Paris he was appointed head
surgeon at the College St.-Come, to the horror of the Sorbonne, where a
professor innocent of Latin seemed a biological monstrosity.
Nevertheless he became surgeon to Henry II, then to Francis II, then to
Charles IX; and though a professed Huguenot, he was spared by royal
order in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. His Deux limes de chirurgie
(1573) added little to the theory, much to the practice, of surgery. He
in- vented new instruments, introduced artificial limbs, popularized the
use of the truss in hernia, improved podalic version in childbirth, made
the first exarticulation of the elbow joint, described monoxide
poisoning, and in- dicated flies as carriers of disease. Famous in the
annals of medicine is his de- murrer to congratulations on his success
in a difficult case: Je le pansay, Dieu le guarit —“l treated him, God
cured him.” He died in 1 590, age seventy - three. He had considerably
improved the status and competence of surgeons, and had given France, in
surgery, that lead which it was to retain for several centuries.</p>

<li>PARACELSUS AND THE DOCTORS</li>
</ol>
<p>In every generation men arise who, resenting the cautious
conservatism of the medical profession, lay claim to remarkable cures by
heterodox means, denounce the profession as cruelly laggard, perform
wonders for a time, and then lose themselves in a mist of desperate
extravagance and isolation. It is good that such gadflies should appear
now and then to keep medical thought on its toes, and good that medicine
should check hasty innovations in dealing with human life. Here, as in
politics and philosophy, radical youth and con- servative age
unwillingly co-operate in that balance of variation and heredity which
is nature’s technique of development.</p>
<p>Philippus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim called himself Aureo-
lus as signifying the carat of his brilliance, and Paracelsus probably
as a Latinization of Hohenheim. 71 His father, Wilhelm Bombast von
Hohen- heim, was the illegitimate son of a hot-tempered Swabian noble.
Left to shift for himself, Wilhelm practiced medicine among poor
villagers near Einsiedeln in Switzerland, and married Elsa Ochsner, an
innkeeper’s daugh - ter and nurse’s aid, who soon afterward developed a
manic -depressive con- dition. This ambivalent ancestry may have
inclined Philip to instability, and to a resentful sense of capacities
inadequately nurtured by his environment. Born in 1493, he grew up amid
his father’s patients, and perhaps in undue</p>
<p>876 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>familiarity with inns, whose unbuttoned life remained always to his
taste. A dubious story alleges that the boy was emasculated by a wild
boar or by drunken soldiers. No woman is known to have figured in his
adult life. When he was nine his mother drowned herself. Probably for
that reason father and son moved to Villach in Tirol. There, says
tradition, Wilhelm taught in a school of mines and dabbled in alchemy.
Certainly there were mines near by, and a smelter; and it is likely that
Philip learned there some of the chemistry with which he was to
revolutionize therapy.</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen he went off to study at Heidelberg. The
restlessness of his nature showed now in his quick passage from one
university to an- other — Freiburg, Ingolstadt, Cologne, Tubingen,
Vienna, Erfurt, finally (15 1 3-1 5) Ferrara — though such scholastic
peregrination was frequent in the Middle Ages. In 1515, without having
won a degree, Philip — now Para- celsus — took service as a barber
surgeon in the army of Charles I of Spain. The campaign over, he resumed
his footloose life. If we may believe him, he practiced medicine in
Granada, Lisbon, England, Denmark, Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, Hungary,
“and other lands.” 72 He was in Salzburg during the Peasants’ War of
1525, treated their wounds, and sympathized with the ir aims. He had a
socialist spell; he denounced money, interest, merchants, and advocated
communism in land and trade, and equal remuneration for all. 78 In his
first book, Archidoxa ( The Arch-Wisdom, 1 524), he rejected theol- ogy
and lauded scientific experiment. 74 Arrested after the failure of the
peas- ants’ revolt, he was saved from the gallows by evidence that he
had never taken up arms; but he was banished from Salzburg, and left in
haste.</p>
<p>In 1527 he was at Strasbourg, practicing surgery and lecturing to
barber surgeons. His doctrine was a confusion of sense and nonsense,
magic and medicine — though God knows how the future will describe our
current cer- tainties. He rejected astrology, then accepted it; he would
not give an enema when the moon was in the wrong phase. He laughed at
the divining rod, but claimed to have transmuted metals into gold. 75
Animated, like the young Agrippa, by a thirst for knowledge, he sought
anxiously the “philosopher’s stone”— i.e., some universal formula that
would explain the universe. He wrote credulously about gnomes, asbestos
salamanders, and “signatures”— the treatment of diseased organs with
drugs resembling them in color or form. He was not above using magical
incantations and amulets as cures 76 — perhaps as suggestive
medicine.</p>
<p>But this same man, dripping with the delusions of his time, boldly
advanced the application of chemistry to medicine. Sometimes he spoke
like a material- ist: “Man derives from matter, and matter is the whole
universe.” 77 Man is to the universe as microcosm to macrocosm; both are
composed of the same elements — basically, salts, sulfur, and mercury;
and the apparently lifeless metals and minerals are instinct with life.
78 Chemotherapy is the use of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 877</p>
<p>macrocosm to cure the microcosm. Man is, in body, a chemical
compound; sickness is a disharmony not of Galen’s “humours” but of the
chemical con - stituents of the body; here was the first modern theory
of metabolism. By and large the therapy of the age depended for its
drugs on the plant and animal world; Paracelsus, deep in alchemy,
stressed the curative possibilities of inorganic materials. He made
mercury, lead, sulfur, iron, arsenic, copper sulfate, and potassium
sulfate parts of the pharmacopoeia; he spread the use of chemical
tinctures and extracts; he was the first to make that “tincture of
opium” which we call laudanum. He encouraged the use of mineral baths,
and explained their diverse properties and effects.</p>
<p>He noted the occupational and geographical factors in disease,
studied fibroid phthisis in miners, and first linked cretinism with
endemic goiter. He advanced the understanding of epilepsy, and related
paralysis and speech disturbances to injuries of the head. Whereas gout
and arthritis had been generally accepted as natural and incurable
accompaniments of increasing age, Paracelsus claimed that they were
curable if diagnosed as due to acids formed by food residues too long
retained in the colon. “All diseases can be traced to a coagulation of
undigested matter in the bowels.” 79 These acids of intestinal
putrefaction he called “tartar” because their deposits in joints,
muscles, kidneys, and blad der “burn like hell, and Tartarus is hell.”
80 “Doc - tors boast of their [knowledge of] anatomy,” he said, “but
they fail to see the tartar sticking to their teeth”; 81 and the word
stuck. He proposed to check the formation of such deposits in the body
by a healthy diet, tonics, and improved elimination; he tried to
“mollify” the deposits by using laurel oil and resin compounds; and in
extreme cases he advocated surgery to allow the accretions to escape or
be removed. He claimed to have cured many cases of gout by these
methods, and some physicians in our time believe they have made cures by
following Paracelsus’ diagnosis.</p>
<p>News of cures accomplished by Paracelsus in Strasbourg reached Basel.
There the famous printer Froben was suffering acute pain in his right
foot. The doctors advised amputation. Froben invited Paracelsus to come
to Basel and diagnose the case. Paracelsus came, and effected a cure
without use of the knife. Erasmus, then living with Froben and many
ailments, consulted Paracelsus, who prescribed for him — we do not know
with what success. In any case these famous patients gave the young
doctor new fame, and a strange medley of circumstances brought him close
to that university pro- fessorship which he coveted.</p>
<p>At this time the Protestants were a majority in the city council of
Basel. Over the objections of Erasmus and the Catholic minority, they
dismissed Dr. Wonecker, the city physician, on the ground that he had
“uttered fresh words against the Reformation,” 82 and they appointed
Paracelsus in his place. The council and Paracelsus assumed that the
appointment carried with</p>
<p>THE REFORMAT/ON</p>
<p>878</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVII</p>
<p>it the right to teach in the university; but the faculty condemned
the appoint- ment, and — knowing the weakness of Paracelsus in anatomy —
proposed a public examination of his fitness. He evaded the test, began
practice as city physician, and gave public lectures in a private hall
without university sanc- tion (1527). He gathered students by a
characteristic invitation:</p>
<p>Theophrastus Bombast of Hohenheim, doctor of both medicines</p>
<p>and professor, greetings to the students of medicine. Of all
disciplines medicine alone… is recognized as a sacred art. Yet few
doctors today practice it with success, and therefore the time has come
to bring it back to its former dignity, to cleanse it from the leaven of
the bar-</p>
<p>barians, and to purge their errors. We shall do so not by
strictly</p>
<p>adhering to the rules of the ancients, but exclusively by
studying</p>
<p>nature and using the experience which we have gained in long years of
practice. Who does not know that most contemporary doctors</p>
<p>fail because they slavishly abide by the precepts of Avicenna, Galen,
and Hippocrates?… This may lead to splendid titles, but does not</p>
<p>make a true doctor. What a doctor needs is not eloquence or knowl-
edge of language and of books… but profound knowledge of Nature and her
works….</p>
<p>Thanks to the liberal allowance the gentlemen of Basel have</p>
<p>granted for that purpose, I shall explain the textbooks which I
have</p>
<p>written on surgery and pathology, every day for two hours, as an</p>
<p>introduction to my healing methods. I do not compile these from</p>
<p>excerpts of Hippocrates or Galen. In ceaseless toil I created
them</p>
<p>anew upon the foundations of experience, the supreme teacher of all
things. If I want to prove anything I shall not do so by quoting</p>
<p>authorities, but by experiment and by reasoning thereupon. If, there-
fore, dear reader, you should feel the impulse to enter into those</p>
<p>divine mysteries, if within a brief lapse of time you should want
to</p>
<p>fathom the depths of medicine, then come to me at Basel…. Basel, June
5, 1527. 83</p>
<p>Thirty students registered for the course. At its opening Paracelsus
ap- peared in the customary professorial robe, but at once he cast it
aside, and stood forth in the rough garb and sooty leather apron of the
alchemist. His lectures on medicine were given in a Latin form prepared
by his secretary Oporinus (who later printed Vesalius’s Fabrica ); on
surgery he spoke in German. This was a further shock to the orthodox
physicians, but hardly so disturbing as when Paracelsus proposed that
“no pharmacist should act in collusion with any doctor.” 84 As if to
signalize his scorn of traditional medi - cine, he merrily threw into a
bonfire — lit by students to celebrate St. John’s Day (June 24, 1527) —
a recent medical text, probably the Surnma Jacobii. “I threw into
St. John’s Fire,” he said, “the Surnma of the books, so that all the
misfortunes might go up in the air with the smoke. Thus the realm of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 879</p>
<p>medicine has been purged.” 85 Men compared the gesture with Luther’s
burn - ing of a papal bull.</p>
<p>Paracelsus’ life in Basel was as heterodox as his lectures. “The two
years I passed in his company,” said Oporinus, “he spent in drinking and
gluttony,</p>
<p>day and night He was a spendthrift, so that sometimes he had not a
penny</p>
<p>left…. Every month he had a new coat made for him, and gave away his
old one to the first comer; but usually it was so dirty that I never
wanted one.” 86 Heinrich Bullinger gave a similar picture of Paracelsus
as a hard</p>
<p>The profession disowned him as a degreeless quack, a reckless
empiric, in- capable of dissection and ignorant of anatomy. He opposed
dissection on the ground that the organs could be understood only in
their united and normal functioning in the living organism. He returned
the scorn of the doc- tors in the liveliest billingsgate. He laughed at
their barbarous prescriptions, their silk shirts, finger rings, sleek
gloves, and haughty gait; he challenged them to come out of the
classrooms into the chemical laboratory, to put on aprons, soil their
hands with the elements, and, bending over furnaces, learn the secrets
of nature by experiment and the sweat of their brows. He made up for his
lack of a degree by taking such titles as “Prince of Philosophy and
Medicine,” “Doctor of Both Medicines” (i.e., physician and surgeon), and
“Propagator of Philosophy”; and he salved the wounds of his vanity with
the confidence of his claims. “All shall follow me,” he wrote, “and the
mon - archy of medicine shall be mine…. All the universities and all the
old writers put together are less talented than my a —” 89 Rejected by
others, he took as his motto, Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest —
“Let him not belong to another who can be his own.” 90 History rebuked
his boasts by making his family name Bombast a common noun.</p>
<p>Whether through collusion with the university faculty, or in a
spontaneous revolt of students against a dogmatic teacher, an anonymous
Basel wit com- posed — and prominently exposed — a lampoon in dog-Latin,
purporting to be written by Galen himself from Hades against his
detractor, whom he called Cacophrastus — Dung- speaker. It made great
fun of Paracelsus’ mystical terminology, called him a madman, and
suggested that he hang himself. Un- able to find the culprit, Paracelsus
asked the town council to question the students one by one, and to
punish the guilty. The council ignored the request. About this time a
canon of the Basel Cathedral offered a hundred guilders to anyone who
would cure him of his disease; Paracelsus cured him in three days; the
canon paid him six guilders, but refused the rest on the ground that the
cure had taken so little time. Paracelsus sued him in court, and lost.
He lost his temper too, denounced his critics as Bescheisser and</p>
<p>880 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>Arschkrdtzer (cheaters and rear-scratchers), and published,
anonymously, a pamphlet branding the clergy and magistrates as corrupt.
The council ordered his arrest, but deferred execution of the order till
the next morning. During the night Paracelsus fled (1528). He had been
ten months in Basel.</p>
<p>In Nuremberg he recapitulated his experience at Basel. The city
fathers gave him charge of a prison hospital; he worked impressive
cures; but he inveighed against the jealous medicos of the town for
their dishonesty, their opulence, and the size of their wives. Noting
that the majority of the coun- cil was Protestant, he defended
Catholicism. The Fuggers, who sold guaiac, were alarmed by his contenti
on that this “holy wood” was useless in the treatment of syphilis. In
1530 he persuaded an obscure printer to publish Three Chapters on the
French Disease, which so berated the doctors that a storm of opposition
forced him to resume his wandering. He wished to pub- lish a larger work
on the same subject, but the city council forbade its print- ing;
Paracelsus, in a letter to the council, pleaded with ineffective
eloquence for the freedom of the press; the book was never printed in
his lifetime. It contained the best clinical description of syphilis yet
written, and advised internal doses, rather than external applications,
of mercury. Syphilis became a battleground of vegetable vs. chemical
therapy.</p>
<p>Moving to Saint-Gall, Paracelsus lived for half a year in the house
of a patient. There and later he wrote his Opus paramirum — “the very
wonderful work”— his Paragranum — “against the grain”?— and Die grosse
Wundartz- ney (The Great Surgery ), all in rough German. They are heaps
of crude ore, with here and there a gem. In 1 534 he relapsed into
magic, and composed Philo sophia sagax, a compendium of the occult.</p>
<p>When his patient in Saint-Gall died he took to the road again,
passing from place to place in Germany, sometimes begging his bread. In
his youth he had uttered some religious heresies — that baptism has only
symbolic significance, that the sacraments are good for children and
fools, but useless for men of intelligence, and that prayers to the
saints are a waste of time. 91 Now (1532), p oor and defeated, he
experienced religious “conversion.” He fasted, gave his remaining goods
to the poor, wrote essays of devotion, and consoled him- self with hopes
of paradise. In 1 540 the Bishop of Salzburg offered him asy- lum, and
the man who had encouraged revolution there fifteen years before
accepted gratefully. He made his will, bequeathing his few coins to
relatives, his instruments to the barber surgeons of the city; and on
September 24, 1541, he yielded his body to the earth.</p>
<p>He was a man overcome by his own genius, rich in varied experience
and brilliant perceptions, but too little schooled to separate science
from magic, too undisciplined to control his fire, too angrily hostile
to infuse his influence into his time. Perhaps his career, along with
Agrippa’s, helped to swell the legend of Faust. Until a century ago
people suffering an epidemic in Austria</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 88</p>
<p>Xmade a pilgrimage to his grave in Salzburg, hoping to be healed by
the magic of his spirit or his bones. 92</p>

<li>THE SKEPTICS</li>
</ol>
<p>The sixteenth century was a poor time for philosophy; theology
absorbed the active thinkers, and faith, ruling every roost, kept reason
in its train. Luther rejected reason as inclining to atheism, 98 but
cases of atheism were rare. A Dutch priest was burned at The Hague ( 1 5
1 2 ) f or denying creation, immortality, and the divinity of Christ, 94
but he was not clearly an atheist. “This year,” wrote an English
chronicler under 1539, “there died in the Uni - versity of Paris a great
doctor, which said there was no God, and had been of that opinion since
he was twenty years old, and was above fourscore years old when he died;
and all that time he had kept that er ror secret.” 96 Guillaume Postel,
in 1552, published a book Contra atheos, but the word atheist was seldom
distinguished from deist, pantheist, or skeptic.</p>
<p>Skeptics were numerous enough to win a blow from Luther. “For the
blind children of the world,” he is reported to have said, “the articles
of faith are too high. That three persons are only one God, that the
true Son of God was made man, that in Christ there are two natures,
divine and human, etc. — all this offends them as fiction and fable”;
and some, he added, doubted whether God had created men whose damnation
He had foreseen. 96 In France there were some skeptics of immortality.
97 Bonaventure Desperiers, in his Cymbalum mundi (1537), ridiculed
miracles, the contradictions of the Bible, and the persecution of
heretics. His book was condemned by Calvin and the Sorbonne, and was
burned by the official hangman. Mar- guerite had to banish him from her
court at Nerac, but she sent him money to keep him alive at Lyons. In
1544 he killed himself, leaving his manuscripts to Marguerite, “prop and
safeguard of all goodness.” 98</p>
<p>The spirit of doubt appeared in politics in the form of attacks on
the divine right and inviolability of kings; and here the skeptics were
usually Protes- tant thinkers uncomfortable under Catholic rulers, or
Catholic thinkers smarting under the triumph of the state. Bishop John
Ponet, resenting Mary Tudor, published in 1558 A Short Treatise of
Politique Power, which argued that “the manifold and continual examples
that have been, from time to time, of the deposing of kings and killing
of tyrants, do most certainly confirm it to be most true, just, and
consonant to God’s judgment…. Kings, princes, and governors have their
authority of the people… and men may recover their proxies… when it
pleaseth them.” 99 John Major, a Scottish professor who helped to form
the mind of John Knox, argued likewise that since all secular authority
derives from the will of the community, a bad king may be deposed and
executed, but only by due process of law.</p>
<p>882 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>The most interesting opponent of royal absolutism was a young
Catholic who achieved a modest immortality by dying in Montaigne’s arms.
Etienne de la Boetie, said the incomparable essayist, “was the greatest
man, to my mind, of our age.” 100 Son of a high official in Perigord,
Etienne studied law at Orleans, and, before the prescribed age, was
admitted as a councilor to the Parlement of Bordeaux. About 1 549, as a
youth of nineteen inspired with republican ideas by his study of Greek
and Roman literature, he wrote — he never published — a passionate
attack on absolutism. He called it Discours sur la servitude volonttnre
, but as it denounced the dictatorship of one over many, it came to be
called Contr’un, Against One. Hear its flaming appeal:</p>
<p>What a shame and disgrace it is when countless men obey a tyrant</p>
<p>willingly, even slavishly! A tyrant who leaves them no rights
over</p>
<p>property, parents, wife, or child, not even over their own lives
—</p>
<p>what kind of a man is such a tyrant? He is no Hercules, no
Samson!</p>
<p>Often he is a pygmy, often the most effeminate coward among the</p>
<p>whole people — not his own strength makes him powerful, him who is
often the slave of the vilest whores. What miserable creatures are his
subjects! If two, three, or four do not revolt against one , there is an
understandable lack of courage. But when hundreds and thousands do not
throw off the shackles of an individual, what remains there of
individual will and human dignity?… To free oneself it is not</p>
<p>necessary to use force against a tyrant. He falls as soon as the
country is tired of him. The people who are being degraded and
enslaved</p>
<p>need but deny him any right. To be free only calls for the
earnest</p>
<p>will to shake off the yoke…. Be firmly resolved no longer to be</p>
<p>slaves — and you are free! Deny the tyrant your help, and like a</p>
<p>colossus whose pedestal is pulled away, he will collapse and break to
pieces. 101</p>
<p>La Boetie proceeded to formulate Rousseau and Tom Paine. Man natu-
rally longs for liberty; inequalities of fortune are fortuitous, and lay
upon the fortunate the obligation to serve their fellow men; all men are
brothers, “made from the same mold” by the same God. Strange to say, it
was the read - ing of this radical pronouncement that attracted the
normally cool and cautious Montaigne to La Boetie, and led (1557) to one
of the most famous friendships in history. Montaigne was then
twenty-four, Etienne was twenty-seven; perhaps Montaigne was then young
enough to harbor radical sentiments. Their friendship was soon ended by
La Boetie’s death at the age of thirty-two (1563). Montaigne described
the final days as if remembering Plato’s account of the death of
Socrates. He so keenly felt the loss of the warmhearted youth that
seventeen years later he spoke of it with deeper feeling than of
anything else in his experience. He had not favored the printing of the
Discours, and mourned when a Genevese pastor published</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 883</p>
<p>it (1576). He ascribed the composition to the generous spirit of
youth, and predated it to the age of sixteen. It was almost the voice of
the French Revolution.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>RAMUS AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite as romantic was the life, and more violent the death, of Petrus
Ramus — Pierre de la Ram6e — who undertook to overthrow the tyranny of
Aristotle. Here was a one-man rule that had lasted three centuries and
more, over not one nation only but many, and over not the body but the
mind, almost over the soul, for had not the pagan thinker been made an
official philosopher of the Church? The humanists of the Renaissance had
thought to displace him with Plato, but the Reformation — or fear of it
— was stran- gling humanism, and in Protestant Germany as well as
Catholic France Aristotelian Scholasticism was still in the saddle when
Luther, who had cursed it, died (1546). To depose the Stagyrite from his
throne seemed to intellectual youth the most legitimate form of
tyrannicide. Applying for the master’s degree at the University of Paris
in 1536, Ramus, aged twenty - one, took as his thesis — to be defended
through a whole day against faculty and all challengers — the
unequivocal proposition, Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent
commentitia esse — “Whatever was said by Aristotle is false.” Ramus’s
career was an ode to education. Born near Calvin’s Noyon in Picardy, he
twice tried to walk to Paris, hungry for its colleges; twice he failed,
and returned defeated to his village. In 1528, aged twelve, he suc-
ceeded by attaching himself as servant to a rich student matriculating
in the College de Navarre — the same that Villon had robbed. Serving by
day, studying by night, Pierre made his way, for eight years, through
the heavy curriculum in the faculty of “arts.” He almost lost his
eyesight in the</p>
<p>process, but he found Plato.</p>
<p>When I came to Paris, I fell among the subtleties of the
sophists,</p>
<p>and they taught me the liberal arts through questions and disputings,
without showing me any other advantage or use. When I had gradu- ated… I
decided that these disputes had brought me nothing but</p>
<p>loss of time. Dismayed by this thought, led by some good angel, I</p>
<p>chanced on Xenophon and then on Plato, and learned to know the</p>
<p>Socratic philosophy. 102</p>
<p>How many of us have made that same exhilarating discovery in youth,
happy to meet in Plato a philosopher who had wine and poetry in his
blood, who heard philosophy in the very air of Athens, caught it on the
wing, and sent it down the centuries still bearing the breath of life,
all those voices of Socrates and his pupils still ringing with the lust
and ecstasy of debate about</p>
<p>884 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>he most exciting subjects in the world! What a relief after the prosy
pages of Aristotle, after reams of middle-of-the-road, and not-so-golden
mean! Of course we — and Ramus — were unfair to Aristotle, comparing his
compact lecture notes with the popular dialogues of his master; only
white hairs can appreciate the Stagyrite. The Aristotle that Ramus knew
was chiefly the logician of the Organon, the Aristotle of the schools,
barely surviving the ordeal of translation into Scholastic Latin, of
transmogrification into a good Christian orthodox Thomist. Three years,
said Ramus, he had spent studying Aristotle’s logic, without ever being
shown a single use or application of it in science or in life. 103</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the Paris faculty, as well as to the learning
and skill and courage of Ramus, that he was given his master’s degree;
perhaps the professors too were weary of logic and moderation. But some
of them were scandalized, and felt that their stock-in-trade had been
damaged by that day’s debate. Enmities began that pursued Ramus to his
death.</p>
<p>His degree entitled him to teach, and he began at once, at the
university, a course of lectures in which he mingled philosophy with
Greek and Latin literature. His classes grew, his earnings mounted, and
he was able to reim- burse his widowed mother for the savings that she
had sacrificed to pay for his graduation fee. After seven years of
preparation he issued in 1543 (the annus imrabilis of Copernicus and
Vesalius) two works that continued his campaign to overthrow the
Aristotelian logic. On e — Aristotelicae animad- versiones — was a
frontal assault, sometimes phrased in impetuous invective; the other —
Diale cticae partitiones ( Divisions of Logic) — offered a new sys- tem
to replace the old. It redefined logic as ars disserendi, the art of
discourse, and brought logic, literature, and oratory together in a
technique of persua- sion. The university authorities forgivably saw
some dangers in this ap- proach. Moreover they viewed with suspicion
certain propositions in Ramus that smelled of heresy, such as, “Unbelief
is the beginning of knowledge” 104 — Cartesian doubt before Descartes;
or his plea to replace the tomes of the Scholastics with more study of
the Scriptures — this had a Protestant ring; or his definition of
theology as doctrina bene vivendi — which threatened to reduce religion
t o morality. And there were Ramus’s irritating ways, his pride and
pugnacity, his violent controversial tone, his dogmatic superiority to
dogma.</p>
<p>Soon after publication of these books the rector of the university
cited Ramus before the provost of Paris as an enemy of the faith, a
disturber of the public peace, a corrupter of youth with dangerous
novelties. The trial was held before a royal commission of five men —
two appointed by Ramus, two by his accusers, one by Francis I.
Dissatisfied with the procedure of the trial, Ramus withdrew his
appointees. The remaining three decided against him ( 1 544) , and a
royal mandate forbade him to lecture, or to publish, or to</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIl) SCIENCE IN THE AGE OF COPERNICUS 885</p>
<p>attack Aristotle further. The condemnation notice was placarded
through- out the city, and was sent to other universities. Students
staged burlesques ridiculing Ramus, and Rabelais made heavenly fun of
the fracas.</p>
<p>After holding his peace for a while, Ramus opened a course of
lectures at the College Ave Maria, but he confined himself to rhetoric
and mathematics, and the government winked at his disobedience. In 1 545
he became assistant rector of the College de Presles, and his lecture
room was soon crowded. When Henry II succeeded Francis I he repealed the
sentence against Ramus, left him “free in both tongue and pen,” and, a
year later, appointed him to a chair in the College Royale, where he
would be exempt from university control.</p>
<p>Having reached his pinnacle as now the most famous teacher in Paris,
Ramus devoted much time and effort to reforming pedagogical methods. If
he stressed “rhetoric”— which then meant literature — it was not only to
revivify philosophy with poetry, but also to infuse a vibrant humanism
into courses grown dry and hard with abstractions and scholastic rules.
In five treatises on grammar he applied logic to language; he begged
French spelling to become phonetic, but it went its reeling way;
however, he succeeded in introducing into the French alphabet the
letters j and v to replace conso- nantal i and u. Remembering his own
penniless striving for an education, he encouraged the establishment of
scholarships for poor students, and con- demned the heavy fees required
for graduation. At the same time he labored to raise the remuneration of
teachers.</p>
<p>In 1555 he published Dialectique, the first work on logic in French.
He argued now not merely about reasoning but for reason. He was by
tempera- ment a foe to traditionalism and mere authority; reason seemed
to him the only authority; and he believed, with Renaissance ardor, that
if reason were left free it would bring all the sciences close to
perfection within a cen- tury. 105 “It was my constant study,” he wrote,
“to remove from the path of the liberal arts… all intellectual obstacles
and retardations, and to make even and straight the way, in order to
arrive more easily not only at intelli- gence but at the practice and
use of the liberal arts.” 100</p>
<p>His character and philosophy inclined him to sympathize with the
Prot- estant revolt. When, for a time, the Huguenots won toleration from
the government, even participation in it, Ramus announced his adherence
to the Reformed faith (1561). Early in 1562 some of his students tore
down the religious images in the chapel of the College de Presles. The
government continued to pay his salary, but his position was
increasingly precarious. When civil war broke out (1562) he left Paris,
with a safe-conduct from Catherine de Medicis; he returned a year later
on the signing of peace. He politely refused an invitation to a chair in
the University of Bologna, saying that he was too indebted to France to
leave it.</p>
<p>886</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>The quarrel that led to his death came into the open when his
chief</p>
<p>enemy, Jacques Charpentier, frankly confessing his ignorance of
mathema- tics, bought his way 107 into a professorship of mathematics at
the College Royale (1565). Ramus denounced the appointment; Charpentier
threat- ened him; Ramus appealed to the courts for protection;
Charpentier was jailed, but was soon released. Two attempts were made on
Ramus’s life, and when the civil war between Catholics and Protestants
was resumed (1567) he left Paris again. The government now ruled that
only a Catholic might teach in the university or the College Royale.
Ramus, returning, retired to private life, but Catherine continued and
doubled his salary, and he was free to devote himself to study and
writing.</p>
<p>In July 1572, Montluc, Bishop of Valence, invited him to join an
embassy to Poland; perhaps the Bishop foresaw the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew, and thought to protect the aging philosopher. Ramus
refused, having no stomach for the enterprise of setting Prince Henry of
Anjou on the Polish throne. Montluc left on August 17; on the
twenty-fourth the Massacre be- gan. On the twenty-sixth two armed men
invaded the College de Presles, and mounted to the fifth floor, where
Ramus had his study. They found him in prayer. One shot him in the head,
the other stabbed him; together they hurled him through the window.
Students or ragamuffins dragged the still living body to the Seine and
threw it in; others recovered it and hacked it to pieces. 108 We do not
know who hired the assassins; apparently not the government, for both
Charles IX and Catherine seem to have continued their favor to Ramus
till the end. 109 Charpentier rejoiced over the Massacre and the murder:
“This brilliant sun, which, during the month of August, has brightened
France…. The stuff and nonsense have disappeared with its author. All
good men are full of joy.” 110 Two years later Charpentier him - self
died, some say of remorse; but perhaps this does him too much
credit.</p>
<p>Ramus seemed defeated in life and influence. His enemies triumphed;
and though some “Ramists” were heard in the next generation in France,
Hol - land, and Germany, the Scholasticism that he had fought regained
its ascend- ancy, and French philosophy hung its head until Descartes.
But if philosophy had gained little in this period, the advances of
science had been epochal; modern science began with Copernicus and
Vesalius. The known earth had been doubled; the world view had been
changed as never before in recorded history. Knowledge was growing
rapidly in scope and spread; the use of the vernacular in science and
philosophy — as by Pare and Paracelsus in medicine, by Ramus in
philosophy — was extending to the middle classes instruction and ideas
formerly confined to tonsured scholars and priests. The “cake of cus -
tom,” the mold of belief, the hold of authority, had been broken. Faith
