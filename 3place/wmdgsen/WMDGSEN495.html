<h4 id="chapter-xxvi">CHAPTER XXVI</h4>
<p>Edward VI and Mary Tudor</p>
<p>I547-5 8</p>
<p>I. THE SOMERSET PROTECTORATE: 1 547-49</p>
<p>T HE ten-year-old boy who succeeded to the throne of England as</p>
<p>Edward VI had been painted by Holbein four years before in one of</p>
<p>the most appealing of all portraits: feathered beret, red hair,
ermine-collared robe, and a face of such gentleness and wistful delicacy
that we should im- agine him to be all Jane Seymour, nothing of Henry
VIII. Perhaps he in- herited the physical frailty that had made her life
his ransom; he never gained the strength to rule. Yet he took in noble
earnest the obligations falling to him as prince or king: zealously
studied languages, geography, government, and war; kept close watch on
all affairs of state that were al- lowed to come under his ken; and
showed to all except nonconforming Catholics so much kindness and good
will that England thought it had buried an ogre to crown a saint.
Educated by Cranmer, he had become an ardent Protestant. He discouraged
any severe punishment for heresy, but was unwilling to let his Catholic
half-sister Mary hear Mass, for he sincerely believed the Mass to be the
most blasphemous idolatry. He accepted gladly the decision of the Royal
Council that chose as regent for him his uncle Ed- ward Seymour — soon
made Duke of Somerset — who favored a Protestant policy.</p>
<p>Somerset was a man of intelligence, courage, and integrity imperfect
but, in his time, outstanding. Handsome, courteous, generous, he shamed
by his life the cowardly and self-seeking aristocracy that could forgive
him every- thing but his sympathy for the poor. Though almost absolute
in power, he ended the absolutism established by Henry VII and VIII,
allowed much greater freedom of speech, reduced the number of actions
previously classed as treason or felony, required sounder evidence for
conviction, returned their dowries to the widows of condemned men, and
repealed the more op- pressive laws of the preceding reign concerning
religion. The King remained head of the English Church, and to speak
irreverently of the Eucharist was still a punishable offense; but the
same statute ordered the sacrament to be administered in both kinds,
prescribed English as the language of the serv- ice, and repudiated
purgatory and Masses for the dead. English Protestants</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>580 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>who had fled from England returned with the pollen of Luther,
Zwingli, and Calvin on them; and foreign reformers, scenting the new
freedom, brought their diverse gospels to the troubled isle. Peter
Martyr Vermigli and Martin Bucer came from Strasbourg, Bernardino Ochino
from Augsburg, Jan Laski from Emden. Anabaptists and Unitarians crossed
the Channel to preach in England heresies that shocked Protestants as
much as Catholics. Iconoclast crowds in London removed crucifixes,
paintings, and statues from the churches; Nicholas Ridley, Principal of
Pembroke College, Cambridge, preached powerfully against religious
images and holy water; and, to cap it all, Archbishop Cranmer “did eat
meat openly in Lent, the like of which was never seen since England was
a Christian country.” 1 The Royal Coun - cil thought this was going too
far, but Somerset overruled it, and gave Re- form its head. Under his
lead Parliament (1547) ordered that every picture on church wall or
window, commemorating a Prophet, Apostle, or saint, should be extirpated
“so that there should remain no memory of the same.” Most of the stained
glass in the churches was destroyed; most of the statues were crushed;
crucifixes were replaced with the royal arms; whitewashed walls and
stainless windows took the color out of the religion of England. There
was a general scramble in each locality for church silver and gold; and
in 1551 the government appropriated what remained. The magnificent
medieval cathedrals barely remained.</p>
<p>The leading spirit in these changes was Archbishop Cranmer; their
leading opponents were Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, and Stephen
Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester; Cranmer had them sent to the Fleet.*
Meanwhile the Archbishop had been working for years on an attempt to
provide in one book a substitute for both the missal and the breviary of
the defeated Church. Peter Martyr and other scholars helped him; but
this First Book of Common Prayer (1548) was essentially Cranmer’s
personal product, in which zeal for the new faith merged with a fine
sense for solemn beauty in feeling and phrase; even his translations
from the Latin had the spell of genius on them. The Book was not quite
revolutionary; it followed some Lutheran leads, as in rejecting the
sacrificial character of the Mass, but it neither denied nor affirmed
transubstantiation; it retained much Catholic ritual, and could be
accepted by not too precise a Romanist. Cranmer sub- mitted it not to
Convocation but to Parliament, and that laic body had no qualms of
jurisdiction in prescribing religious ritual and belief. The Book was
made law of the realm, and every church in England was ordered to adopt
it. Bonner and Gardiner, who were released from jail in a general
amnesty (1549), were reimprisoned when they rejected the right of
Parlia- # A London jail so named from its proximity to the Fleet Stream,
an estuary (now covered) of the T hames.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVl) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 581</p>
<p>ment to legislate on religion. Princess Mary was allowed to hear Mass
in the privacy of her chambers.</p>
<p>A dangerous international situation quieted for a time the violent
debate between Catholics and Protestants. Henry II of France demanded
the evacuation of Boulogne; refused, he prepared to besiege it; and at
any mo- ment Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, then a girl of five in France,
might bring Scotland into the war. Learning that the Scots were arming
and were stir- ring up rebellion in Ireland, Somerset led a force across
the border, and defeated them at Pinkie Cleugh (September 10, 1547). The
terms that he offered to the Scots were remarkably generous and
farseeing: the Scots were not to suffer any forfeiture of liberty or
property; Scotland and England were to be merged into one “Empire of
Great Britain”; each nation was to have self-government under its own
laws, but both were to be ruled, after the current reign, by the
offspring of the Queen of Scots. This was precisely the union effected
in 1603, except that it would have facilitated a restoration of
Catholicism in England, and its continuance in Scotland. The Catholics
of Scotland rejected the plan for fear that English Protestantism would
infect their own land; besides, Scottish nobles were receiving pensions
from the French government, and thought a livre in the hand worth two
pounds in the bush.</p>
<p>Frustrated in seeking peace, facing war with France, struggling to
establish a compromise among uncompromising faiths at home, and hearing
renewed noises of agrarian revolt in England, Somerset drank the cup of
power to the dregs when his own brother plotted to overthrow him. Thomas
Seymour was not content to be Lord High Admiral and a member of the
Privy Coun- cil; he would be king. He wooed Princess Mary, then Princess
Elizabeth, but in vain. He received money stolen from the mint, and
spoils from the pirates whom he allowed in the Channel; and so financed
he gathered secret stores of arms and ammunition. His conspiracy was
discovered; he was ac- cused by the Earls of Warwick and Southampton; he
was almost unani- mously condemned by both houses of Parliament; and on
March 20, 1549, he was put to death. Somerset tried to protect him, but
failed; and the Protector’s prestige fell with his brother’s head.</p>
<p>Somerset’s ruin was completed by Ket’s rebellion. That uprising
illustrated the apparent anomaly that whereas in Germany peasant revolt
was Protes- tant, in England it was Catholic; in each case religion was
a front for eco- nomic discontent, and in England the front was Catholic
because the government was now Protestant. “In t he experience of the
agricultural poor,” wrote the Protestant Froude, “an increase of
personal suffering was the chief result of the Reformation.” 2 It is to
the credit of Protestant divines in this reign — Cranmer, Latimer,
Lever, Crowley — that they condemned the sharpened exploitation of the
peasantry; and Somerset with hot indignation</p>
<p>582 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>denounced the merciless exactions of new landowners “sprung from the
dunghill” of city wealth. 3 Parliament could think of no wise r remedies
than to pass ferocious laws against beggary, and instruct the churches
to take up weekly a collection for the poor. Somerset sent out a
commission to get the facts about enclosures and high rents; it met with
subtle or open resistance from the landlords; tenants were terrified
into concealing their wrongs; and the modest recommendations of the
commission were rejected by the Parliament, in which the agricultural
districts were represented by landowning gentry. Somerset opened a
private court in his own house to hear the complaints of the poor. More
and more nobles, led by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, joined in a
movement to depose him.</p>
<p>But now the peasants, furious with accumulated wrongs and frustrated
suits for redress, burst into revolt from one end of England to the
other. Somersetshire rose first, then Wilts and Gloucestershire, Dorset
and Hamp- shire, Berks and Oxford and Buckingham, in the west Cornwall
and Devon, in the east Norfolk and Kent. At Norwich a minor landlord,
Robert Ket, organized the rebels, seized the municipal government, and
set up a peasant commune that for a month ruled the town and its
hinterland. On Mousehold Hill, north of the city, Ket encamped 16,000
men, and there, under an oak tree, he sat daily in judgment upon
offending landlords arrested by the peasants. He was not bloodthirsty;
those whom he condemned were im- prisoned and fed. But of property
rights and title deeds he made small ac- count. He bade his men scour
the surrounding country, force entry into the manor houses, confiscate
all weapons, and corral for the commune all cattle and provisions
wherever found. Sheep — chief rivals of the peasants for the use of the
soil — were rounded up to the number of 20,000, and were in- continently
consumed, along with “infinite beeves,” swans, hinds, ducks, venison,
and pigs. Amid this feasting Ket nevertheless maintained remark- able
order, even allowing preachers to exhort the men to abandon the revolt.
Somerset felt much sympathy with the rebels, but agreed with Warwick
that they must be dispersed lest the whole economic structure of English
life should be overturned. Warwick was sent against them with an army
recently raised to fight in France. He offered the rebels a general
pardon if they would return to their homes. Ket favored acceptance, but
hotter heads were for judgment by battle, and Ket yielded to them. On
August 17, 1549, the issue was decided; Warwick’s superior tactics won;
3,500 of the rebels were cut down; but when the remnant surrendered
Warwick con- tented himself with nine hangings, and sent Ket and a
brother to prison in London. News of the defeat took the heart out of
the other rebel groups; one after another laid down its arms on promise
of amnesty. Somerset used his influence to have most of the leaders
released, and the Ket brothers for a while survived.</p>
<p>EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>583</p>
<p>The Protector was accused of having encouraged the revolt by his out-
spoken sympathy with the poor. He was branded also with failure in
foreign affairs, for France was now besieging Boulogne. He was justly
accused of allowing corruption among governmental personnel, of debasing
the cur- rency, of augmenting his own fortune, of building his sumptuous
Somerset House amid the near-bankruptcy of the nation. Warwick and
Southampton led a move to unseat him. The majority of the nobles, who
could pardon his wealth but not his tenderness for their peasants,
seized the opportunity for revenge. On October 12, 1549, the Duke of
Somerset was paraded as a prisoner through the streets of London, and
was shut up in the Tower.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE WARWICK PROTECTORATE: 1 549-5 3</li>
</ol>
<p>By the standards of the time Somerset’s enemies were lenient. He was
deprived of such property as he had acquired during his regency; on
Febru- ary 6, 1550, he was released; in May he was restored to
membership in the Royal Council. But Warwick was now Protector of the
Realm.</p>
<p>He was a frank Machiavellian. Himself inclined to Catholicism, he
adopted a Protestant line because his rival Southampton was the accepted
leader of the Catholics, and the majority of the nobles were financially
wedded to the new creed. He had learned well the art of war, but he knew
that with a bankrupt government and an impoverished people he could not
hold Bou- logne against a France having twice the resources of England.
He surren- dered the town to Henry II, and signed an ignominious,
inescapable peace ( I5 5°)-</p>
<p>Under the domination of landlords noble or common, Parliament ( 1
549) passed legislation fearfully punishing the rebellion of the
peasants. Enclo- sures were sanctified by express law; the taxes that
Somerset had imposed on sheep and wool to discourage enclosures were
repealed. Severe penalties were prescribed for workers who combined to
raise their wages. 4 Assem- blies gathering to discuss a lowering of
rents or prices were declared illegal; persons attending them were to
forfeit their property. Robert Ket and his brother were hanged. Poverty
increased, but the almshouses that had been swept away by the religious
revolution were not replaced. Sickness became endemic, but hospitals
were abandoned. The people were famished, but the currency was again
debased, and prices soared. The once sturdy yeomanry of England were
perishing, and the poorest of the poor were sinking into savagery. 5</p>
<p>Religious chaos rivaled economic anarchy. The majority of the people
remained Catholic, 6 but the victory of Warwick over Southampton left
them leaderless, and they felt the weakness of those who stand for the
past.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>The collapse of the spiritual and moral authority of the priesthood,
to- gether with the instability and corruption of the government,
allowed not only a growth of immorality but a bedlam of heresies that
frightened Catho- lics and Protestants al ike. John Clement (1556)
described “the wonderful sort of sects swarming everywhere, not only of
papists . . . but also of Arians, Anabaptists, and all other kind of
heretics . . . some denying the Holy Ghost to be God, some denying
original sin, some denying predestination … in- numerable such like, too
long to be recited.” 7 Roger Hutchinson ( c . 1550) wrote of “Sadducees
and Libertines” (freethinkers), who say “that the Devil … is nothing but
… a filthy affection of the flesh . . . that there is neither place of
rest nor pain after this life, that hell is nothing but a tor- menting
and desperate conscience, and that a joyful, quiet, and merry con-
science is heaven.” 8 And John Hooper, Protestant Bishop of Gloucester,
reported that “there are some who say that the soul of man is no better
than the soul of a beast, and is mortal and perishable. There are
wretches who dare, in their conventicles, not only to deny that Christ
is our Saviour, but to call that blessed Child a mischief- maker and
deceiver.” 9</p>
<p>Utilizing the liberty that had been granted by Somerset, a reckless
fringe among the Protestants satirized the old religion heartlessly.
Oxford students parodied the Mass in their farces, chopped missals to
pieces, snatched conse- crated bread from the altar and trampled it
under foot. London preachers called priests “imps of the whore of
Babylon”— i.e., the pope. 10 Businessmen met for conferences in
St. Paul’s; young gallants gathered there, fought, and slew. The new
protectorate was now definitely Protestant. Reformers were named to
bishoprics, usually on condition that they transfer part of the
episcopal manor to the courtiers responsible for their appointment. 11
Parliament (1550) ruled that all paintings and statues were to be
removed from any church in England except “the monumental figures of
kings or nobles who had never been taken for saints”; and all prayer
books except</p>
<p>Religious persecution, so long of heretics by Catholics, was now in
Eng- land, as in Switzerland and Lutheran Germany, of heretics and
Catholics by Protestants. Cranmer drew up a list of heresies which, if
not abjured.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVi; EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 5#5</p>
<p>were to be punished with death; they included affirmation of the Real
Pres- ence in the Eucharist, or the ecclesiastical supremacy of the
pope, and denial of the inspiration of the Old Testament, or the two
natures in Christ, or justification by faith. 16 Joan Bocher of Kent
went to the stake for questioning the Incarnation (1550). To Ridley,
Protestant Bishop of London, who begged her to recant, she said: “Not
long ago you burnt Anne Askew for a piece of bread 〔for denying
transubstantiation〕, yet came yourselves to believe the doctrine for
which you burnt her; and now you will burn me for a piece of flesh
〔referring to the phrase in the Fourth Gospel — “The Word was made
flesh”〕, and in the end you will believe this also.” 17 Only two
heretics were burned in Edward’s reign; however, many Catholics were
imprisoned for hearing Mass, or openly criticizing the currently
orthodox creed. 18 Obstinately Catholic priests were deposed from their
posts, and some were sent to the Tower. 19 Gardiner, still there, was
offered freedom if he would consent to preach the Reformed faith;
refusing, he was removed “to a meaner lodging” in the Tower, and was
deprived of paper, pen, and books. In 1552 Cranmer issued his Second
Book of Common Prayer, which denied the Real Presence, rejected the
sacrament of extreme unction, and otherwise revised the First Book in a
Protestant direction. Parliament now passed a Second Act of Uniformity,
which required all persons to attend regularly, and only, religious
services conducted according to this Book of Common Prayer; three
violations of this Act were to be punished with death. In 1553 the Royal
Council promulgated forty- two “Articles of Reli - gion” drawn up by
Cranmer, and made them obligatory on all Englishmen.</p>
<p>While virtue and orthodoxy became law, the Warwick protectorate was
distinguishing itself, in a corrupt age, by its corruption. This did not
prevent the malleable young Edward from making Warwick Duke of
Northumber- land (October 4, 1551). A few days later the Duke atoned for
an act of political decency — the release of Somerset — by charging his
predecessor with an attempt to re-establish himself in power. Somerset
was arrested, tried, and convicted, chiefly on evidence given by Sir
Thomas Palmer; an order of the King was forged to ca ll for Somerset’s
execution; and on Janu - ary 22, 1552, he met his death with courage and
dignity. Northumberland, when he in turn faced execution, confessed that
through his means Somer- set had been falsely accused; and Palmer,
before his death, confessed that the evidence he had sworn to had been
invented by Northumberland. 20</p>
<p>Rarely in English history had an administration been so unpopular.
Protes- tant clergymen, who had praised the new Protector in gratitude
for his sup- port, turned against him as his crimes increased. King
Edward was sinking toward death; Mary Tudor, by an act of Parliament,
had been named heiress to the throne if Edward remained childless; and
Mary, made queen, would soon revenge herself on those who had led
England from the old faith. North-</p>
<p>586 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>umberland felt that his life was in jeopardy. His one comfort was
that his agents had formed Edward to his obedience. He induced the dying
King to settle the crown upon Lady Jane Grey, daughter of the Duke of
Suffolk and granddaughter of Henry VUI’s sister; moreover, Jane had
recently</p>
<p>Early in July the King neared his end. He coughed and spat blood, his
legs swelled painfully, eruptions broke out over his body, his hair fell
out, then his nails. No one could say what this strange disease was;
many sus- pected that Northumberland had poisoned him. At last, after
long suffering, Edward died (July 6, 1553), still but fifteen, too young
to share the guilt of his reign.</p>
<p>The next morning Northumberland rode out toward Hunsdon to seize the
Princess. But Mary, warned, escaped to Catholic friends in Suffolk, and
Northumberland returned to London without his prey. By promises,
threats, or bribes, he persuaded the Privy Council to join him in
proclaiming Jane Grey queen. She fainted. Recovering, she still
protested that she was unfit for the perilous honor forced upon her. Her
relatives pleaded with her, arguing that their lives depended upon her
acceptance. On July 9 she reluctantly acknowledged herself to be Queen
of England.</p>
<p>But on July 10 news reached London that Mary had proclaimed herself
queen, that the northern nobles were flocking to her support, and that
their forces were marching upon the capital. Northumberland hurriedly
gathered what troops he could, and led them out to the issue of battle.
At Bury his soldiers told him that they would not take another step
against their lawful sovereign. Crowning his crimes, Northumberland sent
his brother, with gold and jewels and the promise of Calais and Guines,
to bribe Henry II of France to invade England. The Privy Council got
wind of the mission, inter- cepted it, and announced allegiance to Mary.
The Duke of Suffolk went to Jane’s room, and informed her that her ten
-day reign was over. She wel- comed the news, and asked innocently might
she now go home; but the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 587</p>
<p>Council, which had sworn to serve her, ordered her confined in the
Tower. There, soon, Northumberland too was a prisoner, praying for
pardon but expecting death. The Council sent out heralds to proclaim
Mary Tudor queen. England received the tidings with wild rejoicing. All
through that summer night bells caroled and bonfires blazed. The people
brought out tables and food, and picnicked and danced in the
streets.</p>
<p>The nation seemed to regret the Reformation, and to look with longing
upon a past that could now be idealized since it could not return. And
truly the Reformation had as yet shown only its bitterest side to
England: not a liberation from dogma, inquisition and tyranny, but their
intensification; not a spread of enlightenment but a spoliation of
universities and the closing of hundreds of schools; no enlargement of
kindness but almost an end to charity and carte blanche to greed; no
mitigation of poverty but such merciless grinding of the poor as England
had not known for centuries — perhaps had never known. 21 Almost any
change would be welcome that would eliminate Northumberland and his
crew. And poor Princess Mary, who had won the secret love of England by
her patience in twenty-two years of humiliation — surely this chastened
woman would make a gentle queen.</p>

<li>THE GENTLE QUEEN: 1 553~ 54</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand her we should have had to live with her the tragic
youth during which she had hardly ever tasted happiness. She was
scarcely two (1518) when her father took to mistresses and neglected her
grieving mother; eight when he asked for an annulment of his marriage;
fifteen when her parents parted, and mother and daughter went into a
separate exile. Even when the mother was dying the daughter was
forbidden to go to her. 22 After the birth of Elizabeth (1533) Mary was
declared a bastard, and was shorn of her title of princess. The Imperial
ambassador feared that Anne Boleyn would seek the death of her
daughter’s rival for the throne. When Elizabeth was moved to Hatfield
Mary was compelled to go and serve her there, and to live in “the worst
room of the house.” 23 Her servants were taken from her, and were
replaced by others subject to Miss Shelton of Hatfield, who, reminding
her that she was a bastard, said, “If I were in the King’s place I would
kick you out of the K ing’s house for your disobedience,” and told her
that Henry had expressed his intention to have her beheaded. 24 All that
first winter at Hatfield (1534) Mary was ill, her nerves shattered with
contumely and fear, her body and soul not unwillingly near death. Then
the King relented and spared her some casual affection, and for the
remainder of the reign her position eased. But as the price of this hard
graciousness she was required to sign an acknowledgment of Henry’s
ecclesiastical suprem -</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>588</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>acy, her mother’s “incestuous marriage,” and her own illegitimate
birth. 25</p>
<p>Her nervous system was permanently affected by these experiences;
“she was subject to a heart complaint,” 26 and she remained in frail
health till the end of her life. Her courage returned when, under the
Somerset protectorate, Parliament declared her heiress-apparent to the
throne. Since her Catholic faith, bred into her childhood with Spanish
fervor, and strengthened by her mother’s living and dying exhortations,
had been a precious support in her griefs, she refused to abandon it
when she hovered on the edge of power; and when the King’s Council bade
her cease hearing Mass in her rooms (1549) she would not obey. Somerset
connived at her resistance; but Som- erset fell, her brother the King
approved the order, and three of her servants, for ignoring it, were
sent to the Tower (1551). The chaplain who had said Mass for her was
taken from her, and she finally agreed to forgo the beloved ritual. Her
spirit broken, she begged the Imperial ambassador to arrange her escape
to the Continent. The cautious Emperor refused to sanction the plan, and
it fell through.</p>
<p>Her moment of triumph came at last when Northumberland could find no
man to fight against her, and those who came in arms to uphold her cause
asked no pay, but brought their own supplies and offered their personal
for- tunes to finance the campaign. When she entered London as queen
(August 3, 1553) even that half-Protestant city rose almost unanimously
to welcome her. Princess Elizabeth came diffidently to meet her at the
city gates, won- dering whether Mary would hold against her the
indignities suffered in Elizabeth’s name; but Mary greeted her with a
warm em brace, and kissed all the ladies in her half- sister’s train.
England was as happy as when Henry VIII, young and handsome and
generous, had mounted the throne.</p>
<p>Mary was now thirty-seven, and heartless time had already crossed her
face with omens of decay. She had seldom known an adult year without a
serious illness. She was troubled with dropsy, indigestion, and racking
head- aches; she was treated with repeated bloodlettings, which left her
nervous and pale. Her recurrent amenorrhea plunged her at times into
hysterical grief with fear that she would never bear a child. 27 Now her
body was thin and frail, her forehead was wrinkled, her reddish hair was
streaked with gray, her eyes were so weak that she could read only with
the page held close to her face. Her features were plain, almost
masculine; her voice was as deep as a man’s; life had given her all the
frailties, none of the charms, of woman - hood. She had some womanly
accomplishments — she knitted patiently, em- broidered skillfully, and
played the lute; to which she added a knowledge of Spanish, Latin,
Italian, and French. She would have made a good woman had she not been
cursed with theological certainty and royal power. She was honest to the
point of simplicity, incapable of diplomacy, and pitifully anxious to
love and be loved. She had bursts of temper and shrewish speech.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 589</p>
<p>She was obstinate, but not proud; she recognized her mental
limitations, and listened humbly to advice. She was inflexible only
where her faith was con- cerned; otherwise she was clement and
compassionate, liberal to the un- fortunate, and eager to redress the
wrongs of the law. Frequently she visited incognito the homes of the
poor, sat and talked with the housewives, made note of needs and
grievances, and gave whatever help she could. 28 She restored to the
universities the endowments filched from them by her predecessors.</p>
<p>The best side of her character showed in the relative tolerance of
her early reign. She not only released Gardiner, Bonner, and others who
had been imprisoned for refusing to accept Protestantism, but she
pardoned almost all those who had tried to keep her from the throne.
Some of these, however, like the Duke of Suffolk, she compelled to pay
heavy fines into the treasury; then, the revenue being so aided, she
reduced taxes substantially. Peter Martyr and other alien Protestants
were allowed safe-conducts to leave the country. The Queen’s Council
gave a hasty trial to Northumberland and six others who had conspired to
arrest Mary and crown Jane Grey; all seven were condemned to die. Mary
wished to pardon even Northumberland, but Simon Renard, now Imperial
ambassador, dissuaded her. All the unforgiven three made a last-minute
profession of the Roman Catholic faith. Jane Grey called the sentence
just, and the confessions cowardly. 29 Mary proposed to release her, but
yielded so far to her councilors as to order her to be kept in loose
confinement within the Tower grounds. 80</p>
<p>On August 1 3 the Queen issued an official declaration that she would
not “compel or constrain consciences” in the matter of religious belief
; 81 this was one of the first proclamations of religious tolerance by a
modern gov- ernment. Innocently hopeful of converting Protestants by
argument, she arranged a public debate between opposed theologians, but
it evaporated in bitter and inconclusi ve dispute. Shortly thereafter
Bishop Bonner’s chaplain had a dagger thrown at him from a crowd that
resented his Catholic preach- ing; he was rescued from death by two
Protestant divines. 82 Frightened out of her tolerance, Mary ordered
(August 1 8, 1553) that until Parliament could meet and consider the
problems raised by the conflict of faiths, no doctrinal sermons should
be preached except in the universities. Cranmer, still Archbishop, was
bidden keep to his Lambeth palace; he retorted with a bl ast against the
Mass as an “abominable blasphemy”; he and Latimer were</p>
<p>The problems she faced might have overwhelmed one far superior to
her</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>VCHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>590</p>
<p>in intelligence and tact. She was shocked by the confusion and
corruption prevalent in the administration. She ordered the corruption
to stop; it hid its head and continued. She gave a good example by
reducing the expenses of the royal household, pledging a stable
currency, and leaving parliamentary elections free from royal influence;
the new elections were “the fairest which</p>
<p>Even in religion she met with severe economic obstacles. There was
hardly an influential family in England that did not hold property taken
from the Church; 85 such families, of course, opposed any return to the
Roman faith. The Protestants, numerically a minority, financially
powerful, might at any moment provide the sinews for a revolt that would
place Protestant Elizabeth on the throne. Mary was anxious to restore
the right of Catholics to worship according to their own ritual; yet the
Emperor, who had been fighting Protestantism for thirty-two years,
cautioned her to move slowly, and to be content with having Mass said
privately for herself and her immediate circle. But she felt her
religion too deeply to be politic with it. The skeptical gener- ation
that had grown up in London marveled at the frequency and fervor of her
prayers, and the Spanish ambassador probably thought it a nuisance when
she asked him to kneel beside her to ask divine guidance. She felt that
she had a sacred mission to restore the faith that had become so dear to
her because she had suffered for it. She sent a messenger to the Pope
begging him to remove the interdict on religious services in England;
but when Car- dinal Pole wished to come to England as papal legate, she
agreed with Charles that the time was not ripe for so bold a move.</p>
<p>The Parliament that met on October 5, 1553, was by no means
subservient. It agreed to repeal all the legislation of Edward’s rei gn
concerning religion; it reduced to their earlier proportions the severe
penalties prescribed in the laws of Henry VIII and Edward VI; and it
graciously informed the Queen that “the illegitimation of your most
noble person” was now annulled, and she had ceased to be a bastard. But
it refused even to consider the restoration of ecclesiastical property,
it resisted any hint that papal sovereignty should be acknowledged, and
it left Mary the unwilling head of the English Church. By this authority
she replaced Protestant bishops with the Catholic prelates that had been
expelled; Bonner was again Bishop of London; Gardiner was</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 59I</p>
<p>again Bishop of Winchester, and a close adviser of the Crown. Married
priests were dismissed from their parishes. The Mass was again allowed,
then encouraged; and (says a Protestant historian) “the eagerness with
which the country generally availed itself of the permission to restore
the Catholic ritual proved beyond a doubt that except in London and a
few large towns, the popular feeling was with the Queen.” 88 By an edict
of March 4, 1554, the Catholic worship was completely reinstated,
Protestantism and other “heresies” were made illegal, and all Protestant
preaching or p ublication was prohibited.</p>
<p>The nation was much less disturbed by this return of the theological
pendulum than by Mary’s marriage plans. She was constitutionally fearful
of marriage, but she faced the trial in the hope of having an heir who
would prevent the accession of Protestant Elizabeth. Mary claimed to be
a virgin, and probably was; perhaps if she had sinned a bit she would
have been less somber, tense, and certain. Her Council recommended to
her Edward Cour- tenay, great-grandson of Edward IV, but his debauched
ways were not to Mary’s taste. Rejected, he schemed to marry Elizabeth,
depose Mary, en - throne Elizabeth, and rule England through her — never
dreaming how little chance he had of dominating that virile lady.
Charles V offered Mary his son Philip, to whom he was about to bequeath
all but the Imperial title; and he pledged the Netherlands as a gift to
any male issue of the marriage. Mary thrilled at the thought of having
as her husband the ruler of Spain, Flanders, Holland, Naples, and the
Americas; and her half-Spanish blood warmed at the prospect of a
political and religious union of England with Spain. She modestly
suggested that her greater age — ten years ab ove Philip’s— was a
barrier; she feared that her faded charms would not suffice his youthful
vigor or imagination; she was not even sure that she would know how to
make love. 87 For his part Philip was reluctant; his English agents
reported that Mary w as “a perfect saint,” who “dressed badly”; 88 could
not something more alluring be found among the royal families of Europe?
Charles per- suaded him by pointing out that the marriage would give
Spain a strong ally against France, and precious support in the
Netherlands, which were bound to England commercially; perhaps
Protestantism in Germany could be sup- pressed by the united action of
Spain, France, and England as Catholic states; and the union of the
Hapsburgs and the Tudors would constitute a power capable of giving
Western Europe a generation of compulsory peace.</p>
<p>The Queen’s Council and the English people recognized the force of
these considerations, but they feared that the marriage would make
England an appendage of Spain, and would involve England in recurrent
wars against France. Charles countered by offering, in his son’s name, a
marriage contract</p>
<p>59 2</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>she was to share all of Philip’s titles; and if Don Carlos (Philip’s
son by an earlier marriage) died without issue, Mary or her son was to
inherit the Spanish Empire; moreover, added the astute Emperor, Mary was
to receive £ 60,000 a year for life from the Imperial revenues. All this
seemed generous enough, and with a few minor provisions the English
Council sanctioned the marriage. Mary herself, despite her modest
timidity, looked forward to it eagerly. How long she had waited for a
lover!</p>
<p>But the people of England resented her choice. The Protestant
minority, which was bearing up under suppression in the hope that
Elizabeth would soon succeed a fragile and barren Mary, feared for its
life if the power of Spain should stand beside Mary in enforcing the
Catholic restoration. Nobles rich in ecclesiastical property shivered at
the thought of disgorging. Even Catholic Englishmen objected to putting
upon the throne a dour foreigner who would doubtless use England for his
own alien purposes. Protests were voiced everywhere in the land. The
city of Plymouth, in panic, asked the King of France to take it under
his protection. Four nobles laid plans for an uprising to begin on March
18, 1554. The Duke of Suffolk (pardoned father of Jane Grey) was to
raise Warwickshire, Sir James Croft was to lead his Welsh tenants, Sir
Peter Carew would rouse Devonshire, and Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger
would lead the revolt in Kent. The elder Wyatt — the poet — had secured
a mass of Church lands, which his son was loath to surrender. The
conspirators made the mistake of confiding their plans to Courtenay,
whose task was to secur e Elizabeth’s co -operation. Bishop Gardiner,
who had kept watch on Courtenay as a rejected and per- haps vengeful
suitor for Mary’s hand, had him arrested, and Courtenay,</p>
<p>The conspirators, preferring to die in battle rather than on the
block, rose hurriedly to arms, and revolt flared up in four counties at
once (Febru- ary 1554). Wyatt led an army of 7,000 men toward London,
and sent out an appeal to all citizens to prevent England from becoming
an appanage of Spain. The Protestant part of the London populace set in
motion a plan to open the gates to Wyatt. The Queen’s Council hesitated
to commit itself, and raised not one soldier in her defense. Mary
herself could not understand why the country that had so welcomed her
accession should refuse her the happiness and fulfillment that she had
dreamed of through so many years of misery. If now she had not taken
matters into her own hands with un- wonted resolution, her reign and her
life would have soon ended. But she went in person to the Guildhall, and
faced an excited assemblage that was debating which side to take. She
told it that she was quite ready to abandon the Spanish marriage if the
Commons so wished, and indeed “to abstain from marriage wh ile I live”;
but meanwhile she would not let that issue be made “a Spanish cloak” for
a political revolution. “I cannot tell,” she said.</p>
<p>EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>593</p>
<p>“how naturally the mother loveth her child, for I was never the
mother of any; but certainly if a queen may as naturally and earnestly
love her subjects as the mother doth her child, then assure yourselves
that I, being your lady and mistress, do as ear nestly and tenderly love
and favor you.” 39 Her words and spirit were warmly applauded, and the
assembly pledged her its sup- port. Agents of the government were able,
almost in a day, to muster 25,000 armed men. Suffolk was arrested, Croft
and Carew fled into hiding. Wyatt, so abandoned, led his small force to
battle in the streets of London, and made his way almost to the Queen’s
palace at Whitehall. Mary’s guards begged her to flee; she would not.
Finally Wyatt’s men were overcome; he yielded in exhaustion of body and
soul, and was taken to the Tower. Mary breathed safely again, but she
was never more the gentle Queen.</p>

</ol>
<p>Her advisers had often condemned her policy of pardon. The Emperor
and his ambassador had censured her for allowing life, even liberty, to
per- sons who had conspired against her and would be free to do so
again. How, she was asked, could Philip trust himself in a land where
his enemies were left unhindered to plot his assassination? Bishop
Gardiner argued that mercy to the nation required that traitors should
be put to death. The Queen, in a panic of fright, veered to the views of
her counselors. She ordered the execution of Lady Jane Grey, who had
never wanted to be queen, and of Jane’s husband, who had so wanted to be
king. Jane, still but seventeen, went to her death stoically, without
protest or tears (February 12, 1554). Suffolk, her father, was beheaded,
and a hundred lesser rebels were hanged. Some conspirators were spared
for a while in the hope of eliciting useful con- fessions. Wyatt at
first incriminated Elizabeth as privy to the plan, but on the scaffold
(April 1 1, 1 554) he exonerated her of all cognizance. Courtenay, af
ter a year’s imprisonment, was let off with banishment. Charles advised
Mary to put Courtenay and Elizabeth to death as perpetual threats to her
life. Mary sent for Elizabeth, kept her in the palace of St. James for a
month, then for two months imprisoned her in the Tower. Renard urged her
im- mediate execution, but Mary objected that Elizabeth’s complicity had
not been proved. 40 During these fateful months Elizabeth’s life hung in
the balance, and this terror helped to form her character to suspicion
and in- security, and was echoed in the severity of her later reign,
when she had the same worry about Mary Stuart that Mary Tudor now had
about Eliza- beth. On May 18 the future queen was moved to Woodstock,
where she lived in loose confinement but under watch. Fear that another
plot might</p>
<p>594 THE reformation (chap, xxvi</p>
<p>raise Elizabeth to the throne urged Mary on to marriage in the hope
of motherhood.</p>
<p>Philip was not so eager. Through a proxy in England he married Mary
on March 6, 1554, but he did not reach England till July 20. The English
were pleasantly surprised to find him physically and socially tolerable:
a rather strange triangular face sloping from broad forehead to narrow
chin, adorned with yellow hair and beard; but also a gracious manner, a
ready wit, gifts for all, and no hint that he and his retinue considered
the English to be barbarians. Even for Elizabeth he had a kind word,
perhaps foreseeing that Mary might prove childless, that Elizabeth would
someday be queen, and that this would be a lesser evil than the
accession of Mary Queen of Scots — long since bound to France — to the
throne of England. Mary, though so much older than Philip, looked up to
him with girlish admiration. Starved for affection through so many
years, she rejoiced now to have won so charm- ing and mighty a prince,
and she gave herself to him with such unquestioning devotion that her
court wondered whether England was not already sub- ject to Spain. To
Charles V she wrote humb ly that she was now “happier than I can say, as
I daily discover in the King my husband so many virtues and perfections
that I constantly pray God to grant me grace to please him.” 41</p>
<p>Her desire to give Philip a son and England an heir was so absorbing
that she soon conceived herself pregnant. Her amenorrhea was now
welcomed as a royal sign, and hope silenced the thought that that
condition had often come to her before. Digestive disturbances were
accepted as additional proofs of motherhood, and th e Venetian
ambassador reported that the Queen’s “paps” had swollen and given milk.
For a long time Mary rejoiced in the thought that she too, like the
poorest woman in her realm, could bear a child; and we cannot imagine
her desolation when her doctors finally convinced her that her swelling
was dropsy. Meanwhile the rumor of her pregnancy had swept through
England; prayers and processions were arranged for her happy delivery;
soon gossip said that she had borne a boy. Shops closed for a holiday,
men and women feasted in the streets, church bells rang, and a clergyman
announced that the child was “fair and beautiful” as became a prince. 42
Broken with frustration and shame, Mary hid herself for months from the
public view.</p>
<p>She was in a measure consoled by the return of Cardinal Pole to
England. Charles had detained him at Brussels because Pole had opposed
the Spanish marriage; but now that this had been consummated the
Imperial objections subsided; the Cardinal, as papal legate, crossed the
Channel (November 20, 1 554) to the land he had left twenty-two years
before; and the warm wel- come given him by officials, clergy, and
people attested the general satisfac- tion over renewal of relations
with the paoacy. He greeted Mary with</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 595</p>
<p>almost the choicest phrase in his vocabulary: Ave Maria, gratia
plena, Domi- nus tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus, and he trusted that
he might soon add, “Blessed is the fruit of thy womb.” 48 When
Parliament learned that Pole brought papal consent to the retention of
confiscated Church property by the present holders, all went merry as a
wedding should. Parliament, on its knees, expressed repentance for its
offenses against the Church, and Bishop Gardiner, having confessed his
own vacillation, gave the penitents absolu- tion. The ecclesiastical
supremacy of the pope was acknowledged, his right to annates and “first
fruits” was reaffirmed, episcopal courts were re -estab- lished, and
parish tithes were restored to the clergy. The old statutes against
Lollardry were renewed, and censorship of publications was returned from
state to Church authorities. After the turmoil of twenty years
everything seemed as before.</p>
<p>Philip stayed with Mary thirteen months, hoping with her for a child;
when no sure sign of it appeared he begged her to let him go to
Brussels, where the planned abdication of his father required his
presence. She con- sented sadly, went with him to the barge that was to
take him down the Thames, and watched from a window till the barge
disappeared (August 28, 1555). Philip felt that he had done his duty
through an arduous year of making love to a sick woman, and he rewarded
himself with the full-blooded ladies of Brussels.</p>
<p>Pole was now the most influential man in England. He busied himself
with the reorganization and reform of the English Church. With Mary’s
help he restored some monasteries and a nunnery. Mary was happy to see
the old religious customs live again, to see crucifixes and holy
pictures again in the churches, to join in pious processions of priests,
children, or guilds, to sit or kneel through long Masses for the quick
and the dead. On Maundy Thursday, 1556, she washed and kissed the feet
of forty-one old women, shuffling from one to the next on her knees, and
gave alms to all. 44 Now that hope of motherhood had gone, religion was
her sustaining solace.</p>
<p>But she could not quite resurrect the past. The new ideas had aroused
an exciting ferment in city minds; there were still a dozen sects
clandestinely publishing their literature and their creeds. Mary was
pained to hear of groups that denied the divinity of Christ, the
existence of the Holy Ghost, the transmission of original sin. To her
simple faith these heresies seemed mortal crimes, far worse than
treason. Could the heretics know better than her beloved Cardinal how to
deal with the human soul? Word came to her that one preacher had prayed
aloud, before his congregation, that God would either convert her or
soon remove her from the earth. 45 One day a dead dog with a
monastically tonsured head, and a rope around its neck, was thrown
through a window into the Queen’s chamber. 46 In Kent a priest had his
nose cut off. 47 It seemed unreasonable to Mary that the Protestant
emigres, to</p>
<p>596 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>whom she had allowed safe departure from England, should be sending
back pamphlets attacking her as a reactionary fool, and speaking of the
“lousy Latin service” of an “idolatrous Mass.” 48 Some pamphlets urged
their readers to rise in revolt and depose the Queen. 49 A meeting of
17,000 persons at Aldgate (March 14, 1554) heard a call to put Elizabeth
on the throne. 60 In- surrections in England were planned by English
Protestants abroad.</p>
<p>Mary was by nature and habit merciful — till 1555. What transformed
her into the most hated of English queens? Partly the provocation of
attacks that showed no respect for her person, her faith, or her
feelings; partly the fear that heresy was a cover for political revolt;
partly the sufferings and disap- pointments that had embittered her
spirit and darkened her judgment; partly the firm belief of her most
trusted advisers — Philip, Gardiner, Pole — that religious unity was
indispensable to national solidarity and survival. Philip was soon to
illustrate his principles in the Netherlands. Bishop Gardiner had
already (in the spring of 1554) vowed to burn the three Protestant
bishops — Hooper, Ridley, Latimer — unless they recanted. 51 Cardinal
Pole, like Mary, was of a kindly disposition, but inflexible in dogma;
he loved the Church so much that he shuddered at any questioning of her
doctrines or authority. He did not take any direct or personal lead in
the Marian persecution; he counseled moderation, and once freed twenty
persons whom Bishop Bonner had sentenced to the stake. 62 Nevertheless
he instructed the clergy that if all peaceful methods of suasion failed,
major heretics should be “removed from life and cut off as rotten
members from the body.” 63 Mary’s own view was expressed hesitantly.
“Touching the punishment of heretics, we think it ought to be done
without rashness, not leaving meanwhile to do justice to such as by
learning would seek to deceive the simple.” 64 Her responsibility was at
first merely permissive, but it was real. When (1558) the war with
France proved disastrous to her and England, she ascribed the failure to
God’s anger at her lenience with heresy, and thereafter she positively
pro - moted the persecution.</p>
<p>Gardiner opened the reign of terror by summoning to his episcopal
court (January 22, 1555) six clergymen who had refused to accept the
re-estab- lished creed.* One recanted; four, including John Hooper,
deposed Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester, were burned (February 4-8,
1555). Gardiner</p>

of Oliver Cromwell’s England. Many Protestant churchmen have criticized
it for exaggeration, misquotation, prejudice, and carelessness with
details; 55 a Catholic historian compares it, in reliability, with
medieval legends of the saints, but concludes that, though many details
are dubious, “no one doubts that these events did so happen.” 56</h1>

<p>seems to have had a revulsion of feeling after these executions; he
took no further part in the persecution; his health broke down, and he
died in No- vember of this year. Bishop Bonner took charge of the
slaughter. Philip, still in England, advised moderation; when Bonner
condemned six more to the stake the Imperial ambassador, Renard,
objected to “this barbarous precip - itancy”; 57 and Philip’s confessor,
a Spanish friar, preaching before the</p>
<p>Most of the martyrs were simple workingmen who had learned to read
the Bible, and had been encouraged in the Protestant interpretation of
it during the previous reign. Perhaps the persecutors thought it justice
that the ecclesiastics who had done most to inculcate the Protestant
faith should be called upon to testify to it by martyrdom. In September
1555, Cranmer, sixty-six, Ridley, sixty-five, and Latimer, eighty, were
brought from the Tower to stand trial at Oxford. Latimer had tarnished
his eloquent career by approving the burning of Anabaptists and
obstinate Franciscans under Henry VIII. Ridley had actively supported
Jane Grey’s usurpation, had called Mary a bastard, and had assisted in
deposing Bonner and Gardiner from their sees. Cranmer had been the
intellectual head of the English Refor- mation: had dissolved the
marriage of Henry and Catherine, had married Henry to Anne Boleyn, had
replaced the Mass with the Book of Common Prayer, had prosecuted Frith,
Lambert, and other Catholics, had signed Ed- ward’s devise of the crown
to Jane Grey, and had denounced the Mass as a blasphemy. All these men
had now been in the Tower for two years, daily expecting death.</p>
<p>Cranmer was tried at Oxford on September 7. His examiners made every
effort to elicit a recantation. He stood his ground firmly, and was
judged guilty; but as he was an archbishop his sentence was reserved to
the Pope, and he was returned to the Tower. On September 30 Ridley was
tried, and stood his ground. On the same day Latimer was led before the
ecclesiastical court: a man now quite careless of life, dressed in an
old threadbare gown, his white head covered with a cap upon a nightcap
over a handkerchief, his</p>

<p>spectacles hanging from his neck, a New Testament attached to his
belt. He too denied transubstantiation. On October 1 they were
condemned; on October 6 they were burned. Before the pyre they knelt and
prayed to- gether. They were bound with chains to an iron post, a bag of
powder was hung around each man’s neck, the faggots were lit. “Be of
good cheer, Master Ridley,” said Latimer, “play the man; we shall this
day light such a candle, by God’s grace, in England, as I trust shall
never be put out.” 61</p>
<p>On December 4 Pope Paul IV confirmed the sentence against Cranmer.
For a time the first Protestant archbishop of Canterbury gave way to
forgiva- ble fear; no man who could write such sensitive English as the
Book of Com- mon Prayer could face these ordeals without exceptional
suffering of body and mind. Moved perhaps by Pole’s fervent appeal,
Cranmer repeatedly - stantiation, purgatory, and all other teachings of
the Roman church. By every precedent such recantations should have
commuted his sentence to imprisonment, but (according to Foxe) Mary
rejected the retractions as insincere, and ordered Cranmer’s execution.
62</p>
<p>In St. Mary’s Church, Oxford, on the morning of his death (March
21,</p>
<p>1556), he read his seventh and last recantation. Then, to the
astonishment of all present, he added:</p>
<p>And now I come to the great thing, which so much troubleth my</p>
<p>conscience more than anything that ever I did or said in my whole</p>
<p>life, and that is the setting abroad of a writing contrary to the
truth; which now here I renounce and refuse … as written for fear of
death . . . and that is, all such bills and papers which I have written
or signed with my hand since my degradation. . . . And forasmuch as my
hand offended, writing contrary to my heart, my hand shall first be
pun-</p>
<p>ished therefor, for . . . it shall be first burned. And as for the
pope, I</p>
<p>refuse him as Christ’s enemy and Antichrist. 68</p>
<p>On the pyre, as the flames neared his body, he stretched out his hand
into them, and held it there, says Foxe, “steadfast and immovable . . .
that all men might see his hand burned before his body was touched. And
using often the words of Stephen, ‘Lord, receive my spirit,’ in the
greatness of the flame he gave up the ghost.” 64</p>
<p>His death marked the zenith of the persecution. Some 300 persons died
in its course, 273 of them in the last four years of the reign. As the
holocaust advanced it became clear that it had been a mistake.
Protestantism drew strength from its martyrs as early Christianity had
done, and many Catholics were disturbed in their faith, and shamed in
their Queen, by the sufferings and fortitude of the victims. Bishop
Bonner, though he did not enjoy the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 599</p>
<p>work, came to be called “Bloody Bonner” because his diocese saw most
of the executions; one woman called him “the common cutthroat and
general slaughter- slave to all the bishops in England.” 65 Hundreds of
English Prot - estants found refuge in Catholic France, and labored
there to bring the sorry reign to an end. Henry II, while persecuting
French Protestants, encouraged English plots against Catholic Mary,
whose marriage with the King of Spain left France surrounded by hostile
powers. In April 1556, British agents discovered a conspiracy, led by
Sir Henry Dudley, to depose Mary and en- throne Elizabeth. Several
arrests were made, including two members of Elizabeth’s household; one
confession implicated Elizabeth herself, and the French King. The
movement was suppressed, but it left Mary in constant fear of
assassination.</p>
<p>One group of fugitives encountered tribulations that reveal the
dogmatic temper of the times. Jan Laski, a Polish Calvinist, had come to
London in 1548, and had founded there the first Presbyterian church in
England. A month after Mary’s accession Laski and part of his
congregation left London in two Danish vessels. At Copenhagen they were
denied entry unless they signed the official Lutheran confession of
faith. As firm Calvinists, they de- clined. Refused permission to land,
they sailed to Wismar, Liibeck, and Hamburg, and in each case met with
the same demand and repulse. 66 The Lutherans of Germany shed no tears
over Mary’s victims, but denounced them as detestable heretics and
“Devil’s martyrs” for denying the Real Presence of Christ in the
Eucharist. 67 Calvin condemned the merciless sectar- ianism of the
Lutherans, and in that year (1553) burned Servetus at the stake. After
buffeting the North Sea through most of the winter, the refu- gees at
last found entry and humanity at Emden.</p>
<p>Mary moved with somber fatality to her end. Her pious husband, now
anomalously at war with the papacy as well as with France, came to
England (March 20, 1 557) and urged the Queen to bring Britain into the
war as his ally. To make his mission less hateful to the English, he
persuaded Mary to moderate the persecution. 68 But he could not so
easily win public support; on the contrary, a month after his arrival,
Thomas Stafford, a nephew of Cardinal Pole, fomented a rebellion with a
view to freeing England from both Mary and Philip. He was defeated and
hanged (May 28, 1557). To fill the Queen’s cup of misery the Pope in
that month repudiated Pole as papal legate, and accused him of heresy.
On June 7 Mary, anxious to please Philip, and convinced that Henry II
had supported Stafford’s plot, declared war against France. Having
accomplished his purpose, Philip left England in July. Mary suspected
that she would never see him again. “I will live the rest of my days
without the company of men,” she said. 69 In this unwanted war England
lost Calais (January 6, 1558), which it had held for 21 1 years; and</p>
<p>6oo</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>the thousands of Englishmen and women who had lived there, and now
fled as penniless fugitives to Britain, spread the bitter charge that
Mary’s govern - ment had been criminally negligent in defending
England’s last possession on the Continent. Philip made a peace
favorable to himself, without requiring the restoration of Calais. It
was an old phrase that that precious port was “the brightest jewel in t
he English crown.” Mary added another mot to the tale: “When I am dead
and opened you will find Calais lying in my heart.” 70</p>
<p>Early in 1558 the Queen again thought herself pregnant. She made her
will in expectation of a dangerous delivery, and dispatched a message to
Philip beseeching his presence at the happy event. He sent his
congratula- tions, but he did not have to come; Mary was mistaken. She
was now quite forlorn, perhaps in some measure insane. She sat for hours
on the floor with knees drawn up to her chin; she wandered like a ghost
through the palace galleries; she wrote tear-blotted letters to a King
who, anticipating her death, ordered his agents in England to incline
the heart of Elizabeth toward marriage with some Spanish grandee, or
with Philip himself.</p>
<p>In Mary’s final summers a plague of ague fever moved through England.
In September 1558, it struck the Queen. Combined with dropsy and “a su -
perfluity of black bile,” it so weakened her that her will to live fell
away.</p>
<p>On the same day died Cardinal Pole, as profoundly defeated as his
Queen. In estimating him we must record the bitter fact that at the
beginning of his last month he had condemned three men and two women to
be burned for heresy. It is true that all parties except the
Anabaptists, in those years of mad certainty, agreed that religious
unity had to be preserved, even, if necessary, by punishing dissent with
death. But nowhere in contemporary Christendom — not even in Spain —
were so many men and women burned for their opinions as during Reginald
Pole’s p rimacy of the English Church.</p>
<p>For Mary we may speak a more lenient word. Grief, illness, and many
suffered wrongs had warped her mind. Her clemency passed into cruelty
only after conspiracies had sought to deprive her of her crown on her
head. She listened too trustingly to ecclesiastics who, having
themselves been per- secuted, sought revenge. Till the end she thought
she was fulfilling by mur- der her obligations to the faith which she
loved as the vital medium of her life. She does not quite dese rve the
name of “Bloody Mary,” unless we are to spread that adjective over all
her time; it simolifies pitilessly a character</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) EDWARD VI AND MARY TUDOR 6oi</p>
<p>in which there had been much to love. It is her strange distinction
that she carried on the work of her father in alienating England from
Rome. She showed to an England still Catholic the worst side of the
Church she served. When she died England was readier than before to
accept the new faith that she had labored to destroy.</p>
