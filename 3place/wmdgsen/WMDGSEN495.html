Triumph of the Philosophes</h4>
<p>I 7 I 5 _ ^9</p>
<p>I. THE CLERGY FIGHTS BACK</p>
<p>T HERE was much to be said for Christianity, and its defenders said
it with vigor, sometimes with blind misjudging of the age, sometimes</p>
<p>with the grace and clarity that France expects even of theology.
There were ecclesiastics who still insisted that any deviation from
defined Cath- olic doctrine should be punished by the state, and that
the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was as legitimate as surgery. 1 But
there were others who took up the gage like gentlemen, and allowed the
enemy to choose the weapon- reason. It was a gallant gesture, for when a
religion consents to reason it begins to die.</p>
<p>Some nine hundred works in defense of Christianity were published in
France between 1715 and 1789, ninety in one year (1770) alone. 2
Diderot’s Pensees philosophiques, Helvetius’ De I’Esprit, Rousseau’s
Emile, drew ten refutations each. The Abbe Houteville, in La Religion
cloretienne prou- vee par les faits (1722), contended (like Archbishop
Whately a century later) that the miracles proving the divinity of
Christianity were as reliably attested as the accepted events of secular
history. The Abbe Guyon spread through two volumes his satirical Oracle
des nouveaux philosophes (1759-</p>
<p>60). The Abbe Pluche spread out the Spectacle de la nature in eight
vol- umes (1739-46); it went through eighteen costly editions; it
displayed the wonders of science, and the evidences of design in nature,
to manifest the existence of a Deity supreme in intelligence and power.
If the human mind finds some puzzles in the immense scene, let it be
modest; we must not re- ject God because we cannot understand him;
meanwhile let us be grateful for the splendor and glory of his works.
The Abbe Gauchat in fifteen volumes of Lettres critiques (1755-63)
attacked the evolutionary hypoth- eses of Buffon, Diderot, and others
with a reckless argument: “If men were</p>
<p>755</p>
<p>756</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>La Philo sophie chretienne (17 65), stressed the necessity of
religion as a support for morality; purely secular restraints merely
sharpen the wits of criminals who no longer believe in the all-seeing
eye of God. In 1767 the Abbe Mayeul Chandon published a Dictionnaire
antiphilosophique which went through seven editions. In 1770 Pere
Nonotte, “an ex -Jesuit with the vast erudition of the members of this
order,” 4 issued his massive Erreurs de Voltaire ; this book sold out
four editions in its first year, six in eight years; as late as 1857
Flaubert listed it as part of the reading of Emma Bovary. The Abbe
Guenee defended the Bible with “spirit, taste, urbanity, and learn -
ing” in Lettres de quelques Juifs (1776), letters purporting to come
from</p>
<p>The materialists encountered an able opponent in Nicolas
Sylvestre</p>
<p>Bergier, a parish priest in the diocese of Besan§on. His Deisme
refute par lui- meme (17 65) was “the answe r of a real.cure to the
Savoyard Vicar of Rousseau’s imagination.” 6 For his Certitude des
preuves du Christianisme (1767) he received a letter of praise from the
Pope. At the age of fifty-one (1769) he was elevated to a canonry in
Notre-Dame-de-Paris, and became confessor to the daughters of Louis XV.
In that year he published an Apologie de la religion chretienne contre
/’ auteur du Christianisme devoile —a blast against d’Holbach. Pleased,
the Assembly of the Clergy voted him (1770) an annual pension of two
thousand livres to give him more leisure to defend the faith. Within a
year he issued a two-volume Examen du materialisme , a reply to
d’Holbach’s Systeme de la nature. He pointed out again that mind is the
only reality immediately known to us; why should it be reduced to
something else known only through mind? 7 He charged d’Holbach with
several inconsistencies: ( 1 ) the Baron pronounced God to be
unknowable, but then applied to matter those qualities of infinity and
eternity which he had found unintelligible in our concept of the Deity;
(2) he accepted determinism, and yet exhorted men to reform their con-
duct; (3) he attributed religion (a) to the ignorance of primitive man,
(b) to the chicanery of priests, (c) to the cunning of lawmakers — let
him make up his mind. The abbe put aside the criticism of the Old
Testament by ex- plaining that the human amanuenses of God had used
Oriental metaphors; therefore the Bible must not always be taken
literally. The New Testament is the essence of Christianity; the
divinity of the religion is proved by the life and miracles of Christ;
however, the authority of the Church rests not on the Bible only, but on
the Apostolic Succession of her bishops and their traditions of the
faith. In Examen de la religion chretienne (1771) Bergier</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>stressed the argument that atheism, despite the exceptional
individualities signalized by Bayle, would ruin morality.</p>
<p>The finest figure among the clerical defenders of Catholicism in
eight- eenth-century France was Guillaume Francois Berthier. 8 Entering
at the age of twelve (1714) the Jesuit college at Bourges, he
distinguished him- self by a keenness of mind that did no visible harm
to his piety. At seven- teen he expressed to his parents his desire to
join the Society of Jesus; they bade him think it over for a year; he
did, and persisted. In his novitiate at Paris he read, studied, and
prayed so assiduously that he seldom gave more than five hours a day to
sleep. He developed so rapidly that at nineteen he was appointed to
teach the humanities at the College de Blois. After seven years there,
and another year of novitiate, he was sent to Rennes, then to Rouen, as
professor of philosophy. In 1745 the Jesuits made him editor of their
Journal de Trevoux, which was then published in Paris. Under his
leadership this periodical became one of the most respected voices of
edu- cated France.</p>
<p>He wrote most of the Journal himself. He lived in a small cell,
never</p>
<p>heated, and worked every hour of the waking day. His door was open to
all who came; his mind was open on every subject but the faith that
warmed his life. La Harpe, a pupil of Voltaire, described Berthier as
“that man uni - versally admired by scholars for his vast knowledge, and
by all Europe for his modest virtues.” 9 He had the charm of French
courtesy, even in con - troversy; he attacked ideas, not characters, and
praised the talents of his opponents. 10 Nevertheless, he defended
religious intolerance. Believing that the Catholic Church had been
founded by Christ the Son of God, he held it a Christian duty to
prevent, by any peaceful means, the dissemination of religious error; in
a Christian nation anti-Christian propaganda should be banned as
injurious to moral conduct and the stability of the state. He thought
“it would be wrong to confound Catholic intolerance with zeal for
persecution,” 11 but he offered no promise that persecution would not be
resumed. In 1759 he retorted the charge of intolerance upon the philoso-
phes: “Unbelievers, you accuse us of a fanaticism which we do not have a
semblance of possessing, while the hatred which animates you against our
religion inspires in you a fanaticism whose too apparent excesses are
in- conceivable.” 12</p>
<p>He did not admit the universal finality of reason. Even on Locke’s
sen - sationist terms, reason can reach only as far as the senses;
beyond these limits there are realities that must forever remain
mysteries to finite minds; therefore the “true philosopher limits his
search where he cannot reason - ably penetrate.” 13 To seek to subject
the universe, or the traditional and general beliefs of mankind, to the
test of individual reason is a form of in- tellectual pride; a modest
man will accept the creed of his fellow men, even</p>
<p>758</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>if he cannot understand it. In a rare mean moment Berthier suggested
that many unbelievers reject religion because it interferes with their
pleasures. If such libertins should prevail, he predicted, the moral
code would collapse, passion would be loosed, and civilization would
disappear in a morass of self-seeking, sensualism, deceit, and crime. If
there is no free will, there is no moral responsibility; “since it
[determinism] does not admit any law binding the conscience, the only
guilty person will be the one who does not succeed.” 14 Morality would
then be merely a cal culus of expediency; no sense of justice would
restrain the clever minority from abusing the sim- plicity of the
majority; no ruler would feel any other obligation to his people than to
keep his exploitation of them this side of revolution. 15</p>
<p>Berthier, as we have seen, welcomed and commended the first volume of
the Encyclopedic. He exposed its inaccuracies and plagiarisms with
incon- testable scholarship; so he showed that the article “Agir” (To
Act), by the Abbe Yvon, extending to three col umns in folio, was taken
“completely and word for word from Father Buffier’s Traite des verites
premieres.” 1 * He praised the article on Arab philosophy, but expressed
dismay at find- ing in the article “Athee” the arguments for atheism
laid out at the same length, and with the same force, as those against
it, leaving the existence of God in serious doubt. When, in Volume II,
the anti-Christian bent became more evident, he attacked it with verve
and skill. He pointed out that the Ency elope die derived the authority
of a government from the consent of the governed; this, said Berthier,
is a view dangerous to hereditary mon- archy. He may have been
instrumental in having the Encylopedie re- pressed. 17</p>
<p>In the Journal de Trevoux for April, 1757, h e examined Voltaire’s
Essai sur les moeurs. “It is sad for us to find here a living author
whose talents we admire, [but who] abuses them in the most essential
matters.” He saw in Voltaire’s work an attempt “to destroy the Church
and religion, to elevate upon their ruins a philosophic structure, a
temple dedicated to license of thought, and vowed to independence from
all authority, to re- duce and restrict worship and morality to a
philosophy purely human and secular.” He charged Voltaire with a bias
that disgraced the historian, with an almost complete blindness to the
virtues and services of Christianity, and a passionate resolve to find
every possible fault in its teachings and career. Voltaire, he said,
pretended to believe in God, but the effect of his writings was to
promote atheism. When, in the same issue, Berthier turned to Vol-
taire’s La Puce lie, he lost his temper and cried out:</p>
<p>Never has hell vomited up a more deadly plague…. Voluptuous-</p>
<p>ness here impudently displays the most lewd pictures; obscenity bor-
rows the language of the market place;… the basest buffoonery</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>759</p>
<p>seasons its impiety…. The odor given off by these verses is enough to
infect and corrupt every age and condition in society. 18</p>
<p>Voltaire did not hurry to reply. He still entertained an affectionate
re- membrance of his Jesuit teachers, still had on the walls of his
study at Ferney a portrait of the kindly and devoted Father Poree. 18
But when the French government suppressed the Encyclopedie he yielded to
d’Alem - bert’s urging, and took up arms against Berthier. He accused
him of oppos - ing the Encyclopedie because it competed with the
Dictionnaire de Tre- voux, which he supposed to be a Jesuit product (it
was so only in part, and unofficially); and he invited the Society of
Jesus to dissociate itself from this “gazetteer” of Trevoux. “What an
employment for a priest,… to sell every month, from a bookstore, an
anthology of slander and rash judg- ments!” 20 Berthier answered (July,
1759) that the editors of the Journal de Trevoux had no connection with
the editors of the Dictionnaire de Tre- voux; he confessed that being a
“gazetteer” was “neither beautiful nor agreeable,” but he upheld the
right of a priest to use a periodical to praise good works and censure
bad. He regretted that Voltaire had stooped to personalities and charges
of venality; and he ended by expressing the hope that “this man of fine
talents” would, in “the remaining moments which Providence is allowing
him,” return to “that holy religion— not only the natural but the
Christian and the Catholic — in which he was born.” 21 In November
Voltaire (doubt less remembering Swift’s imaginary burial of John
Partridge) issued a solemn Relation de la maladie, la confession, la
mort, et F apparition du jesuite Berthier, telling how the editor had
died of a fit of yawning over the Journal de Trevoux. He excused his
method of controversy in a letter to Mme. d’fipinay: “We must render
Finfame and its defenders ridiculous.” 22</p>
<p>In 1762 the parlements of France ordered the suppression of the
Jesuits. Glad to end his travail as editor, Berthier went to a Trappist
monastery for a silent and meditative retreat. He asked to be admitted
to that order, but the general of the Jesuits refused to release him. He
was engaged by Louis XV to tutor the royal children, but when the King
(1764) signed the</p>
<p>decree expelling all Jesuits from France, Berthier emigrated to
Germany. In 1776 he was allowed to return. He lived in retirement with
his brother in Bourges, and died there, aged seventy-eight, in 1782. He
was a good man.</p>

<li>THE ANT. IPHILOSOPHES</li>
</ol>
<p>The war became bloodier when cassocks and courtesies were discarded
and the journalists set their sights on the philosophes; now all the wit
and vocabulary of Paris were brought to bear and to kill. We have seen
how</p>
<p>760</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Voltaire in 1725 went to some trouble to save Pierre Desfontaines
from the statutory punishment for homosexual acts, which was death.
Desfon- taines never forgave him. In 1 7 3 5 he began a periodical
publication, Observa- tions sur les ecrits modemes , which continued
till 1743. In its pages he made himself the defender of all the virtues,
chastity in particular; he attacked with indignation any sign of lax
morality, or of imperfect orthodoxy, in the litera- ture of the day. He
became the bitterest enemy of Voltaire. When he died ( 1 745) he
bequeathed his crusade to his friend Freron.</p>
<p>£lie Catherine Freron was the ablest, bravest, and most learned of
the antiphilosophes. He was scholar enough to write an Histoire de Marie
Stuart (1742) and an eight-volume Histoire de f empire (TAllemagne
(1771). He was poet enough to compose an “Ode sur la bataille de Fon -
tenoy” (1745), which Voltaire must have viewed as insolent competition
with his own ode as royal historiographer. He founded in 1745 a
periodical, Lettres sur quelques ecrits de cette dge, which more than
once drew blood from Voltaire. Freron had his years of poverty en route
to a coach-and- four; once he suffered six weeks of imprisonment in the
Bastille for criticiz- ing an influential abbe; but he fought for thirty
years his lusty battle for the past. He harbored some intelligible
resentment against Voltaire for dis- suading Frederick from hiring him
as Paris correspondent. 23 In 1754 he founded a new review, Annee
litteraire, which he edited and mostly wrote, and published every ten
days until 1774.</p>
<p>Freron admired the religious conservatism of Bossuet, and the stately
ways and style of the seventeenth century; he felt that the philosophes
had a culpably superficial understanding of social organization, the
supports of morality, and the consolations of faith.</p>
<p>Never was there an age more fertile than ours in seditious
writers,</p>
<p>who… concentrate all their powers on attacking the Godhead.</p>
<p>They call themselves apostles of humanity, never realizing that it
ill</p>
<p>befits a citizen, and does a grave disservice to mankind, to rob them
of the only hopes which offer them some mitigation of their life’s ills.
They do not understand that they are upsetting the social order, in-
citing the poor against the rich, the weak against the strong, and put-
ting arms into millions of hands hitherto restrained from violence by
their moral and religious sense quite as much as by the law. 24</p>
<p>This attack upon religion, Freron predicted, would loosen all the
founda- tions of the state. He anticipated by a generation the warnings
of Edmund Burke.</p>
<p>Is not the fanaticism of your irreligion more absurd and more</p>
<p>dangerous than the fanaticism of superstition? Begin by
tolerating</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE FhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>he faith of your fathers. You talk of nothing but tolerance, and</p>
<p>never was a sect more intolerant…. As for me, I hold to no cabal</p>
<p>of bel esprit, and to no party except that of religion, morality,
and</p>
<p>honor. 25</p>
<p>Freron was an acute critic. He lost no chance to puncture the
sensitive vanity of the philosophes. He made fun of their dogmaticism,
and of Voltaire’s seignorial pretensions as “Comte de Tournay.” When
they re - plied by calling him a rascal and a bigot, he retaliated by
calling Diderot a hypocrite, Grimm a sycophant of foreign notables, and
the whole infidel group “knaves, crooks, puppies, and scoundrels.” 26 He
ac cused the Ency- clopedists of stealing illustrations from Reaumur’s
book on ants; they denied the charge; the Academie des Sciences
supported their denial; later facts substantiated the charge. 27 He did
not do so well in re Calas; he suggested that the evidence indicated
Calas’ guilt, and he wrote that Voltaire, in de - fending Calas, “was
not so much carried away by the feeling of humanity as by the urge to
recall public attention to his existence,” and “to make people talk
about him.” 28 Mil e. Clairon, a leading tragedienne, liked and visited
Voltaire; Freron sedulously praised her rival, and dropped hints about
the immoral private life of a certain actress. The actors resented his
allegations as undue interference with their personal affairs; the Due
de Richelieu, no persecutor of adultery, persuaded Louis XV to order
Freron back to the Bastille, but the Queen secured his pardon “for his
piety and zeal in combating the philosophes.” 29 When Turgot, friend of
the philoso - phes, rose to power, the privilege of the Annee litteraire
was withdrawn (1774). Freron comforted himself with good food, and died
of a hearty meal (1776). His widow asked Voltaire to adopt his daughter,
but Voltaire thought that this would be carrying gallantry to
extremes.</p>
<p>Almost as damaging to the philosophes as Freron’s thirty volumes was
one word — the last in the title of Jacob Nicolas Moreau’s satire,
Nouveau Memoir e pour servir cl I’histoire des cacouacs (1757). The
Cacouacs, said Moreau, were a species of barely human animals who
carried a pouch of poison under their tongues; when they spoke, this
venom mingled with their words and polluted all the surrounding air. The
clever author quoted passages from Diderot, d’Alembert, Voltaire, and
Rousseau; he argued that these men were veritable poisoners of the
breath of life, and he charged them with doing evil “precisely for the
pleasure of doing evil.” 30 He called them atheists, anarchists,
immoralists, egoists; but it was the term cacouac that pained them most
keenly; it suggested the cacophony of quacking ducks, the bedlam of
insane prattlers, sometimes (as the word intended) the odor of latrines.
Voltaire struggled to reply, but who can refute a smell?</p>
<p>762</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>The conservatives took courage and multiplied their blows. In
1757</p>
<p>hey won an ambitious and vivacious recruit. Charles Palissot de
Monteney had visited Voltaire at Les Delices (1754), with an
introduction by Thie- riot as “a disciple formed by your works.” 31 A
year later he staged at Nancy a comedy genially satirizing Rousseau. In
Paris he cultivated the young and devout Princesse de Robecq, who was at
least the friend of the Due de Choiseul. Diderot, adept in faux-pas, had
censured her morals in the preface to his Fils naturel. Perhaps to
placate her, Palissot published (1757) Petites Lettres sur de grands
philosophies, severely criticizing Diderot but praising Voltaire. And on
May 2, 1760, under the patronage of Mile, de Robecq, he offered at the
Theatre-Fran§ais the outstanding comedy of the season, Les Philosophes.
This was to Helvetius, Diderot, and Rousseau what the Clouds of
Aristophanes had been to Socrates 2,183 years before. Helvetius was
portrayed as the philosopher-pedant Valere, who explains the altruism of
egoism to the bluestocking Cidalise; the audi- ence at once recognized
in this lady Mme. Geoffrin, whose salon was fre- quented by the
philosophes. Diderot was portrayed as Dortidius. In the servant Crispin,
who moved across the stage on all fours, munching lettuce, the Parisians
saw a caricature of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who had in 1750 denounced
civilization and idealized a “state of nature.” It was crude but
legitimate satire, and everyone but the victims enjoyed it. Mile, de
Robecq had packed the house with her friends, other devots, and several
members of the hierarchy. The Princess herself, though dying of
tuberculosis, in- sisted on gracing the premiere with her feverish
beauty; at the end of the second act she had Palissot summoned to her
box, and publicly embraced him; then, coughing blood, she was carried
home. 32 In twenty-nine days Les Philosophes was played fourteen
times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a loftier figure had joined in the attack upon the
unbelievers. Jean Jacques Le Franc, Marquis de Pompignan, a provincial
magistrate, wrote poems and plays significant enough to win him election
to the Acad- emy. In his speech of acceptance he denounced</p>
<p>his deceptive philosophy, which calls itself the organ of truth
and</p>
<p>serves as an instrument of calumny. It vaunts its own moderation and
modesty, and swells with importance and pride. Its followers, bold and
haughty with the pen, tremble basely in their lives. There is nothing
sure in their principles, no consolation in their ethics, no rule for
the present, no goal for the future. 33</p>
<p>Louis XV praised the speech. Voltaire made fun of it in an anonymous
seven-page pamphlet entitled Les Quand, each paragraph beginning with
the word quand — when. For example:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>763</p>
<p>When one has the honor to be received into an honorable society</p>
<p>of men of letters, it is not necessary that his reception speech be
a</p>
<p>satire on men of letters; this is to insult the society and the
pub-</p>
<p>lic….</p>
<p>When one is scarcely a man of letters at all, and not in the least
a</p>
<p>philosopher, it does not become him to say that our nation has only a
false literature and a vain philosophy…</p>
<p>and so forth, not very brilliantly. But then Morellet followed with a
broad- sheet of ifs ( Les Si), and, soon afterward, one of •wherefores (
Les Pour - quoi)-, and Voltaire added successive sheets of tos, thats,
whos, y esses, noes, and whys. Pompignan fled from this hurricane to his
native Montauban, and never appeared in the Academy again. But in 1772
he returned to the conflict with La Religion vengee de Pincredulite par
Tincredulite meme. Materialism, he urged, left no real sanction for
morality; if there is no God everything is permitted; all we need do is
to elude the police. And if there is no heaven, “how,” asked the
Marquis, “will you persuade men that they should be satisfied with the
position of subordination that the republic allots them?” 34</p>
<p>The Abbe Galiani, coming from Naples to Paris in 1761, and for eight
years shining in the salons, told the philosophes — who loved him — that
the plea of some of them to “follow nature” wa s a counsel of madness
that would reduce civilized men to brutality and savagery; 35 that the
evidences of design in the universe were overwhelming; 36 and that
skepticism led to in- tellectual emptiness and spiritual despair:</p>
<p>By dint of enlightening ourselves we have found more void than</p>
<p>fullness…. This void, persisting in our souls and our
imagination,</p>
<p>is the true cause of our melancholy. 37… After all is said and done,
in- credulity is the greatest effort the spirit of man may make against
his own instincts and tastes…. Men need certainty…. The ma-</p>
<p>jority of men, and especially of women (whose imagination is double
ours)… could not be agnostic; and those capable of agnosticism</p>
<p>would be able to sustain the effort only a t the height of their
souls’</p>
<p>youth and strength. If the soul grows old, some belief reappears. 38…
Agnosticism is a reasoned despair [mi desespoir raisonne ]. 39</p>
<p>Against the brilliant Galiani, the learned Bergier, the courteous
Berthier, the industrious Freron, the titled Pompignan, the tantalizing
Palissot, and the cackling Moreau the philosophes used every weapon of
intellectual war, from reason and ridicule to censorship and
vituperation. Voltaire gave up his peace, risked his security, to
answer, often with more wit than argu- ment, every assailant of
philosophic and raison. “Send me the names of</p>
<p>764</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>hese miserable fellows,” he wrote to Diderot, “and I will t reat them
as they deserve.” 40</p>
<p>It was difficult to get at Moreau, for he was librarian and
historiographer to the Queen. But Pompignan could be pilloried with
particles, and Palissot could be punctured with puns. So Marmontel
wrote, quite untranslatably:</p>
<p>Cet hornrne avait nom Pali.</p>
<p>On dit d’abord Palis fade,</p>
<p>Puis Palis fou, Palis flat;</p>
<p>Palis froid et Palis fat;</p>
<p>Pour couronner la tirade</p>
<p>En fin de turlupinade,</p>
<p>On rencontra le vrai mot:</p>
<p>On le nomma Palis-sot.</p>
<p>M’abaissant jusqu’cL toi,</p>
<p>Je joue avec le mot;</p>
<p>Reflechis, si tu peux,</p>
<p>Mais n’ecris pas… lis… sot.</p>
<p>This man had once the name Pali.</p>
<p>At first they called him Palis</p>
<p>Dull,</p>
<p>Then Palis Low and Palis Fool,</p>
<p>Palis Vain and Palis Cool.</p>
<p>To top all the tirade</p>
<p>And end the pasquinade,</p>
<p>The fit word came at once —</p>
<p>They named him Palis Dunce.</p>
<p>To come down to your level</p>
<p>I with the word must revel.</p>
<p>Reflect, if you can use that tool,</p>
<p>But write not; rather read, you</p>
<p>fool.</p>
<p>Diderot postponed his revenge till he retailed Pallissot’s debauchery
in Le Neveu de Rameau;* 1 it was hardly worthy of a philosopher, but he
had the decency not to publish it, and it did not see French print till
after its vic- tim’s death. Morellet, h owever, sent forth at once a
stinging satire, lam- pooning not only Palissot but his protectrice,
Mile, de Robecq. Her</p>
<p>friends at court had Morellet committed to the Bastille (June 1 1,
1760), and she made matters worse for him by dying (June 26). Rousseau
secured his release, but henceforth dissociated himself from the
philosophes. Palissot tarnished his triumph with dissipation. In 1778 he
turned with the Vol- tairean tide, and rejoined the philosophes.</p>
<p>Their heaviest blows fell upon Freron. Diderot described him, in
Le</p>
<p>Neveu,* 2 as one of a group of literary hacks who lived by eating at
the table of the millionaire Bertin. Voltaire devoted one of his
cleverest quips to Freron:</p>
<p>V autre jour, au fond d’un vallon,</p>
<p>Un serpent piqua Jean Freron.</p>
<p>Que pensez-vous qu’il arriva?</p>
<p>Ce fut le serpent qui creva.*</p>
<p>Typical of the grossness that often interrupted the good manners of
Vol- taire and the eighteenth century was his description of Freron as
ll le vet</p>
<p>• “The other day, down in a valley, a serpent stung John Freron. What
think you happened</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>765</p>
<p>sorti du cul de Desfontaines ” (the worm that came out of
Desfontaines’ behind). 43 But the grand attack came in Voltaire’s play
UEcossaise ( The Lady from Scotland ), which opened at the Theatre-F
ran§ais on July 26,</p>
<ol start="1760" type="1">
<li>It burlesqued Palissot’s Les Philosophes with obvious exaggerations
by ascribing to his victims the responsibility for the defeats of the
French armies in war and the collapse of the state finances. Freron was
pictured as a Grub Street scribbler who manufactured infamy at one
pistole per para- graph. Among the terms applied to him in Voltaire’s
play were scoundrel, toad, hound, spy, lizard, snake, and heart of
filth. 44 Voltaire followed cus - tom by packing the house with friends
of himself or the freres. The play rivaled Palissot’s in popularity,
appearing sixteen times in five weeks.</li>

<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE FALL OF THE JESUITS</li>
</ol>
<p>The sudden collapse of the Society of Jesus, though it was effected
rather by the Parlement of Paris than by the philosophes, revealed the
temper of the times. Called by its founder the “Company of Jesus,”
approved by Pope Paul III in 1 540 as Societas Jesu, “a mendicant order
of clerks regu - lar” (i.e., a body of religious following a defined
rule and living on alms), these “Jesuits,” as their critics called them,
became within a century the most powerful group of ecclesiastics in the
Catholic Church. By 1575 they had established twelve colleges in France
alone; soon they dominated the education of French youth. For two
hundred years the kings of France chose Jesuits as their confessors;
other Catholic rulers followed suit; and by this and other means the
Society of Jesus intimately influenced the history of Europe.</p>
<p>Almost from their beginnings in Paris they were opposed by the Parle-
ment and the Sorbonne. In 1 594 the Parlement accused them of
instigating the attempt of Jean Chatel upon the life of Henry IV, and in
1610 it</p>
<p>charged them with having stirred Ravaillac to murder the King. The
Parle- ment gave force to its accusations by referring to the De rege of
the Span- ish Jesuit Mariana, who had defended, under certain
conditions, the moral- ity of regicide. But the Society grew in number
and power. It dominated the religious policies of Louis XIV, and led him
to attack the Jansenists of Port-Royal as Calvinists in a Catholic
disguise. The Provincial Letters then</p>
<p>7 66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>written by Pascal ( 1656 f.) were still remembered by the educated
minority in France. Nevertheless, in 1749 the Society had 3,350 members
in France, of whom 1,763 were priests. They stood out among the French
clergy as the best scholars, the subtlest theologians, the most eloquent
preachers, the most devoted, industrious, and successful defenders of
the Church. They contributed to a score of sciences, and influenced the
forms of art. They were, by general consent, the best educators in
Europe. They were distin- guished by the austerity of their morals, and
yet they used every device of casuistry to lighten the demands of
Christian ethics upon common men; even so they never condoned the
adulteries of the nobles or the kings. By their arduous preparation and
their patient persistence they made them- selves a power over the
policies of sovereigns and the minds of men. At times it seemed that all
Europe would yield to the tenacity of their united and disciplined
will.</p>
<p>Their power almost ruined them. It became too evident to the kings
that the “Ultramontanism” of the Jesuits, if unchecked, would make all
secular rulers the vassals of the popes, and would restore the authority
of Imperial Rome. Though closer than any other group to royal ears, they
defended the right of the people to overthrow the king. Though they were
relatively liberal in theology and morals, and strove to reconcile
science and the Church, they cultivated popular piety by supporting the
claim of Marguerite Marie Alacoque that Christ had revealed to her his
Sacred Heart burning with love for mankind. They trained the intellects
of Descartes, Moliere, Voltaire, and Diderot, only to see these
brilliant men turn against them and the whole system of Jesuit
education.</p>
<p>It was charged that the curriculum of their schools clung too long to
Latin; that it discouraged the growth of knowledge by excluding any but
traditional ideas; that it appealed too much to memory and to passive
obe- dience; that the unchanging ratio studiorum had lost touch with the
needs of the time for a greater utilization of science and a more
realistic view of human life. So d’Alembert, in the article “College” in
the Encyclopedic, deplored the six years spent by Jesuit pupils in
acquiring a dead language; he recommended more attention to English and
Italian, to history and science and modern philosophy; he appealed to
the government to take control of education and establish a new
curriculum in new schools. In 1762 Rousseau published his Emile,
announcing a revolution in education.</p>
<p>The philosophes, however, were a minor factor in the decline of the
Jesuits in France. A kind of mutual truce dulled the mutual hostility:
the unbelievers respected the learning and character of the Jesuits, and
these, by patient handling, hoped to bring the errant skeptics back into
the ortho- dox fold. Voltaire found it hard to make war against his
former teachers. He had submitted his Henriade to Father Poree with a
request for the cor-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>767</p>
<p>rection of any passages injurious to religion. 46 In the Temple de
gout he had praised the Jesuits for their appreciation of literature,
and for their large use of mathematics in the education of youth. The
Journal de Tre- voux responded with favorable reviews of the Henriade,
Charles XU, and the Philosophic de Newton. This entente demi-cordiale
ended when Vol- taire joined Frederick in Potsdam; the Jesuit leaders
then abandoned him as a lost soul, but as late as 1757 some of them
attempted a reconciliation between Voltaire and the Society. 47 At
Ferney (1758 f.) Voltaire main- tained friendly relations with the local
Jesuits; several of them enjoyed his hospitality; meanwhile he had
attacked the Church on a hundred pages of the Essai sur les moeurs, and
he was writing anti-Christian articles for the Dictionnaire philo
sophique. When he heard of the attack upon the Jesuits of Portugal (
1757 f.) by the chief minister, Carvalho, and the burning of the Jesuit
Malagrida (1764), he denounced Carvalho’s charges as unjust, and
condemned the execution as an atrocity. 48 But all through those years
he himself was at war wi th the Church, and the writings of his
“brethren,” Diderot, d’Alembert, and Morellet, were contributing to the
weakening of the Jesuits in France.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Masonic lodges, generally dedicated to deism, shared in
the sapping operation. But the strongest influences in the tragedy were
per- sonal and class antagonisms. Mme. de Pompadour could not forget
that the Jesuits had opposed every step in her rise, had denied
absolution to the King as long as he kept her, and had refused to take
seriously her sudden conversion to piety. Cardinal de Bernis, long a
favorite of the Marquise, later declared that the suppression of the
Society in France was due mainly to the unwillingness of the Jesuit
confessors to grant absolution to La Pompadour despite her assurances
that her relations with Louis XV were no longer physical. 49 The King
echoed her resentment. Why were these priests, so lenient to others, so
hard on the woman who had brightened his weary, isolated life? Why were
they increasing in corporate wealth while he was struggling to raise
funds for his army and navy in a disastrous war — and for the robes of
his mistress and the pensions of her understudies in the Parc aux Cerfs?
Damiens had tried to kill the King; the Jesuits had no demonstrable
connection with the attempt; but Damiens had had a Jesuit confessor; and
had not some dead Jesuit defended regicide? The King began to listen to
Choiseul and other semi-Voltaireans in his minis- try, who argued that
the time had come to free the state from tutelage to the Church, to
build a social and moral order independent of an obscur- antist clergy
and a medieval theology. If little Portugal, darkly supersti- tious, had
dared to expel the Jesuits, why could not enlightened France?</p>
<p>Stricken by these diverse enmities, and widely suspected of having
bound France to Austria in the Seven Years’ War, the Jesuits suffered a
strangely</p>
<p>768</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>sudden unpopularity. After the defeat of the French by Frederick at
Ross- bach (1757), and the fortunes of France had apparently reached
nadir, and crippled soldiers became a frequent sight in Paris, the
Jesuits became a target for jokes, rumors, slanders running even to
suggestions of peder- asty. 54 They were accused of worldliness, of
heresy, of coveting wealth, of being the secret agents of foreign
powers. Many of the secular clergy criti- cized their theology as too
liberal, their casuistry as demoralizing, their politics as the betrayal
of France to Rome. In 1759 d’Alembert wrote to Voltaire: “Brother
Berthier and his accomplices dare not appear on the streets these days
for fear that people will throw Portuguese oranges at their heads.”
51</p>
<p>The most powerful of all the forces that were converging upon the
Jesu- its was the hostility of the Paris Parlement. That assemblage was
composed of lawyers or magistrates belonging to the noblesse de robe,
encased in gowns as awesome as the cassocks of the priests. This second
aristocracy, well organized and eloquently vocal, was rapidly rising in
power, and eager to challenge the authority of the clergy. Moreover, the
Parlement was pre- dominantly Jansenist. Despite all the suppression
that Jansenism had suf- fered, that austere doctrine, the gloomy outcome
of Paul’s hardening of Christ’s more gentle Christianity, had captured
large sections of the French middle class, and most thoroughly those
legal minds that felt its logic and saw in it a stance of strength
against the Jesuits. Now, it was precisely the Jesuits who had urged
Louis XIV to pursue the Jansenists to the complete destruction of
Port-Royal, and to the bitter compulsion to accept the re- luctant papal
bull that had made Jansenism a heresy more disabling than atheism. If
only some opportunity would come to retaliate those injuries, to avenge
that persecution!</p>
<p>The Jesuits gave the Parlement that opportunity. They had for genera-
tions past engaged in industry and commerce as a means of financing
their seminaries, colleges, missions, and politics. In Rome they held a
monopoly in several lines of production or trade; in Angers, France,
they ran a sugar refinery; 52 they maintained trading posts in many
foreign lands, as in Goa; in Spanish and Portuguese America they were
among the richest entre- preneurs. 53 Private enterprise complained of
this competition, and even good Catholics wondered why an order vowed to
poverty should accumu- late such wealth. One of their most active
businessmen was Father Antoine de La Valette, superior-general of the
Jesuits in the Antilles. In the name of the Society he managed extensive
plantations in the West Indies. He em- ployed thousands of Negro slaves,
54 and exported sugar and coffee to Europe. In 1755 he borrowed large
sums from banks in Marseilles; to repay these loans he sent a shipment
of merchandise to France; the vessel, with a cargo valued at two million
francs (,000,000?), was seized by Eng-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>769</p>
<p>lish men-of- war (1755) in the preliminaries to the Seven Years’ War.
Hop - ing to recoup these losses, La Valette borrowed more; he failed
and declared bankruptcy, owing 2,400,000 francs. His creditors demanded
payment, and asked the Society to acknowledge responsibility for the
debts of La Valette. The Jesuit leaders refused, alleging that he had
acted as an individual, and not in the name of their order. The bankers
sued the Soci- ety. Father Frey, political expert of the Society in
France, advised it to lay the matter before the Parlement. It was sb
done (March, 1761), and the fate of the order lay in the hands of its
strongest enemy. Meanwhile a Jes- uit sent a secret paper to the King,
recommending dismissal of Choiseul from the ministry as a man hostile to
the Society and religion. Choiseul defended himself successfully.</p>
<p>Parlement seized the opportunity to examine the constitutions and
other documents revealing the organization and activities of the
Society. On May 8 it gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and
ordered the Society to pay all of La Valette’s debts. The Jesuits began
to make arrangements</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>two decrees. One condemned to the fire a large number of Jesuit
publi- cations of the preceding two centuries as “teaching murderous and
abomi - nable” principles against the security of citizens and
sovereigns; it forbade further additions to the membership of the
Society in France; and ordered that by April 1, 1762, all Jesuit schools
in France be closed except such as should receive letters of permission
from the Parlement. The other decree offered to receive complaints
against abuses of authority in or by the Soci- ety. The King (August 29)
suspended the execution of these decrees; Parlement consented to hold
them in abeyance till April 1. The harassed King tried for a compromise.
In January, 1762, he sent to Clement XIII, and to Lorenzo Ricci, general
of the Jesuits, a proposal that henceforth all the general’s powers for
France should be delegated to five provincial vicars sworn to obey the
laws of France and the Gallican Articles of 1682, which in effect freed
the French Church from submission to the pope; furthermore, the Jesuit
colleges in France should be subject to inspection by the parlements.
Both the Pope and Ricci rejected this proposal with a defiant response:
“Sint ut sunt, aut non sint” (Let them [the Jesuits] be as they are, or
not at all) , 56 In behalf of the Society Clement appealed to the French
clergy directly, which violated French law; the French clergy re- fused
to accept the brief, and remitted it to the King, who returned it to the
Pope.</li>
</ol>
<p>The provincial parlements now entered the drama. Various reports
filed with them added to the charges against the Jesuits. The Parlement
of</p>
<p>77 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Rennes in Brittany was impressed by the Comptes rendus des
constitutions des Jesuites presented to it in 1761-62 by its procureur
general , Louis Rene de La Chalotais. This charged the Society with
heresy, idolatry, illegal operations, and the inculcation of regicide;
it contended that every Jesuit had to swear absolute obedience to the
pope and to the general of the order, who resided in Rome; that
therefore the Society was by its very constitu- tion a threat to France
and the King; and it urged that the education of children should be the
exclusive right of the state. On February 15, 1762, the Parlement of
Rouen ordered all Jesuits in Normandy to vacate their houses and
colleges, to remove all foreign directors, and to accept the Gal- lican
Articles. Similar decrees were issued by the Parlements of Rennes,
Aix-en-Provence, Pau, Toulouse, Perpignan, and Bordeaux. On April 1 the
Parlement of Paris ordered the enforcement of its decrees, and trans-
ferred to other administrators the Jesuit schools within its
jurisdiction. The secular clergy, though traditionally jealous of the
Jesuits, tried to save them. An assembly of French bishops (May 1 )
appealed to the King in behalf of the order as</p>
<p>an institution useful to the state,… a society of religious who
were</p>
<p>so praiseworthy for the integrity of their morals, the austerity of
their discipline, the vastness of their labors and their erudition, and
for the countless services they have rendered to the Church….
Everything,</p>
<p>Sire, pleads with you in favor of the Jesuits: religion claims them
as</p>
<p>its defenders, the Church as her ministers, Christians as the
guardians of their conscience; a great number of your subjects who have
been their pupils intercede with you for their old masters; all the
youth of the kingdom pray for those who are to form their minds and
their</p>
<p>hearts. Do not, Sire, turn a deaf ear to our united supplication.
67</p>
<p>The Queen, her daughters, the Dauphin, and the others of the devot
party at the court added their pleas for the Jesuits, but Choiseul and
Pompa- dour now definitely advised the King to yield to the Parlement
and close the Jesuit schools. Louis was reminded that he must soon raise
new taxes, and that these would require the assent of the Parlement.
While he vacil- lated between opposed counsels the Parlement took
decisive steps. On Au- gust 6, 1762, it declared that the Society of
Jesus was inconsistent with the laws of France, that the oaths of the
members overrode their loyalty to the King, and that the subjection of
the Society to an alien authority made it a foreign body within a
supposedly sovereign state; therefore the Parle- ment ordered the
Society dissolved in France, and bade the Jesuits vacate, within eight
days, all their French property, which was declared forfeited to the
King.</p>
<p>The King delayed by eight months the full execution of this
decree.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS 77 1</p>
<p>Two parlements — Besar^on and Douai — refused to obey the decrees;
three — Dijon, Grenoble, Metz — temporized. But the Paris Parlement
insisted, and finally, in November, 1764, Louis ordered the complete
suppression of the Society of Jesus in France. The confiscated property
amounted to 58 million francs, 58 and may have helped to reconcile the
King to the dis- solution. A small pension was allowed to the
ex-Jesuits, and for a time they were permitted to stay in France; but in
1767 the Paris Parlement decreed that all former Jesuits must leave
France. Only a few renounced their order and remained.</p>
<p>The expulsion was agreeable to the nobility, the middle class, the
literati, and the Jansenists, but was unpopular with the rest of the
population. Christophe de Beaumont, archbishop of Paris, vigorously
condemned the actions of the Parlement. An assembly of the French clergy
(1765) unani- mously expressed grief over the dissolution of the
Society, and pleaded for its restoration. Pope Clement XIII, in the bull
Apostolicum, proclaimed the innocence of the Jesuits; the bull was
burned in the streets of several cities by the public executioner, on
the ground that the popes had no legal right to interfere with French
affairs. 39 The philosophes at first hailed the expulsion as an
inspiring victory for liberal thought, and d’A lembert noted with
pleasure the comment of the Biblical scholar Jean Astruc that “it was
not the Jansenists but the Encyclopedic that killed the Jesuits.” 60 The
num - ber of free-thought publications now rapidly increased; it was in
the decade after th e expulsion that d’Holbach and his aides carried the
anti -Christian campaign to the point of atheism.</p>
<p>On second thought, however, the philosophes perceived that the
victory belonged less to them than to the Jansenists and the parlements,
and that it left free thought facing an enemy far more intolerant than
the Jesuits. 61 In his Histoire de la destruction des Jesuites (1765)
d’Alembert expressed only a tempered elation over their fate:</p>
<p>It is certain that the greater part of them, who had no voice in
af-</p>
<p>fairs,… should not have suffered for the faults of their
superiors,</p>
<p>if such a distinction were practicable. There were thousands of
in-</p>
<p>nocents whom we have regretfully confused with some twenty guilty
individuals…. The destruction of the Society will redound to the</p>
<p>great advantage of reason, provided Jansenist intolerance does
not</p>
<p>succeed to Jesuit intolerance…. If we had to choose between</p>
<p>hese two sects we should prefer the Society of Jesus as the less</p>
<p>yrannical. The Jesuits — accommodating people provided one did not
declare himself their enemy — allowed one to think as he pleased. The
Jansenists want everyone to think as they do. If they were masters</p>
<p>hey would exercise the most violent inquisition over minds, speech,
and morals. 62</p>
<p>772</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>As if to illustrate these views, the Jansenist Parlement of Paris, in
the same year of 1762 in which it ordered the dissolution of the Society
of Jesus, also ordered the public burning of Rousseau’s relatively pious
Smile; the Jansenist Parlement of Toulouse, in that year, broke Jean
Calas on the wheel; the Paris Parlement, in 1765, burned Voltaire’s
Dictionnaire philo - sophique, and, a year later, confirmed the sentence
of torture and execution laid upon the young Chevalier de La Barre by
the court of Abbeville.</p>
<p>On September 25, 1762, d’Alembert had written to Voltaire: “Do you
know what I heard about you yesterday? That you begin to pity the Jesu-
its, and are tempted to write in their favor.” 63 There had always been
a fund of pity in Voltaire, and now that the battle against the
Society</p>
<p>seemed thoroughly won he could hear some voices of reproach from his
dead teachers. He took into his home at Ferney one of the ex-Jesuits,
Pere Adam, who handled his charities and regularly beat him at chess.
Voltaire warned La Chalotais: “Beware lest one day Jansenism do as much
harm as the Jesuits have done…. What will it serve me to be delivered
from the foxes if they deliver me to the wolves?” 64 He feared that the
Jansenists, like the Puritans in seventeenth-century England, would
close the theaters, and the theater was almost his favorite passion. So
he wrote to d’Alembert: “The Jesuits were nec essary; they were a
diversion; we made fun of them, and we are going to be crushed by
pedants.” 63 He was ready to pardon the Jesuits if only because they had
loved the classics and the drama. 66 His friend and enemy Frederick the
Great joined in these sentiments. “Why,” Frederick asked the Prince de
Ligne in 1764,</p>
<p>why have they destroyed those repositories of the graces of Athens
and Rome, those excellent professors of the humanities, and perhaps of
humanity, the Jesuits? Education will suffer…. But as my</p>
<p>brothers the Kings, most Catholic, most Christian, most faithful
and</p>
<p>apostolic, have tumbled them out, I, most heretical, gather as many
as I can; I preserve the breed. 87</p>
<p>When d’A lembert warned Frederick that he would regret this
amiability, and reminded him that the Jesuits had opposed his conquest
of Silesia, the King reproved the philosopher:</p>
<p>You need not be alarmed for my safety; I have nothing to fear
from</p>
<p>he Jesuits. They can teach the youth of the country, and they are</p>
<p>better able to do that than anyone else. It is true that they were on
the other side during the war, but as a philosopher you ought not to re-
proach one for being kind and humane to everyone of the human</p>
<p>species, no matter what religion or society he belongs to. Try to
be</p>
<p>more of a philosopher and less of a metaphysician. 68</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>When Pope Clement XIV dissolved the entire Society of Jesus in 1773
Frederick refused to allow the publication of the papal bull in his
realm. The Jesuits were maintained in their property and functions in
Prussia and Silesia.</p>
<p>Catherine II left undisturbed the Jesuits whom she found in that part
of Poland which she appropriated in 1772, and she protected those who
later entered Russia. There they labored patiently until their
restoration (1814).</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>EDUCATION AND PROGRESS</li>
</ol>
<p>But who would educate French youth now that the Jesuits were gone?
Here was chaos, but also an opening for a pedagogical revolution.</p>
<p>La Chalotais, still warm with his indictment of the Jesuits, seized
the opportunity, and offered to France an Essai cP education nationale
(1763) which the philosophes crowned with acclaim. His present plea was
that the schools of France should not pass from one religious fraternity
to an- other — for example, to the Christian Brothers or to the
Oratorians. He was no atheist; at least he welcomed the support of
religion for morality; he would have it taught and honored, but he would
not have the clergy con- trol education. He admitted that many
ecclesiastics were excellent teachers, unrivaled in patience and
devotion, but sooner or later, he argued, their domination of the
classroom closed the mind to original thought, and in- doctrinated
pupils with loyalty to a foreign power. The rules of morality should be
taught independently of any religious creed; “the laws of ethics take
precedence over all laws, both divine and human, and would subsist even
if these laws had never been declared.” 09 La Chalotais too wanted</p>
<p>774</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>education of women, but it was unnecessary to educate the poor. The
son of a peasant would not learn in school anything better than he would
learn in the field, and further education would merely make him
discontent in his class.</p>
<p>Helvetius, Turgot, and Condorcet were shocked by this last opinion,
but Voltaire applauded it. He wrote to La Chalotais: “I thank you for
for - bidding laborers to study. I, who cultivate the earth, need manual
work- ers, not tonsured clerics. Send me especially ignorant brothers to
drive or harness my coaches.” 73 And to Damilaville, who had proposed
education for all: “I doubt if those who have only their muscle to l ive
by will ever have time to become educated; they would die of hunger
before becoming philosophers…. It is not the manual worker whom we must
instruct, it is the urban bourgeoisie.” 74 In other passages he
condescended to favor primary education for all, but hoped that
secondary education would be sufficiently restricted to leave a large
class of manual workers to do the physical work of society. 716 The
first task of education, in Voltaire’s view, was to end the
ecclesiastical indoctrination which he held responsible for the
superstitions of the masses and the fanaticism of the crowd.</p>
<p>Diderot, at the request of Catherine II, drew up in 1773 a Plan d’une
universite pour le gouvemement de la Russie. Like La Chalotais, he de-
nounced the traditional curriculum, in terms that we hear today:</p>
<p>In the Faculty of Arts there are still taught… two dead lan-</p>
<p>guages, which are of use to only a small number of citizens, and
these languages are studied for six or seven years without being
learned. Un- der the name of rhetoric the art of speaking is taught
before the art of thinking; under the name of logic the head is filled
with Aristotelian subtleties;… under the name of metaphysics trifling
and knotty</p>
<p>points are discussed, laying the foundation of both skepticism
and</p>
<p>bigotry; under the name of physics there is an endless dispute about
matter and the system of the world, but not a word of natural history
[geology and biology], of chemistry, of the movements and gravita-</p>
<p>ion of bodies; there are very few experiments, still less
anatomical</p>
<p>dissection, and no geography. 76</p>
<p>Diderot called for state control of education, for lay teachers, and
for more science; education should be practical, producing good
agronomists, technicians, scientists, and administrators. Latin should
be taught only after the age of seventeen; it could be omitted
altogether if the student had no prospect of using it; but “it is
impossible to be a man of letters without a knowledge of Greek and
Latin.” 77 Since genius may arise in any class, the schools should be
open to all, without charge; and poor children should receive books and
food free. 78</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>775</p>
<p>So belabored, the French government struggled to avert the
educational interregnum threatened by the expulsion of the Jesuits. The
confiscated property of the order was largely applied to a
reorganization of the five hundred colleges of France. These were made
part of the University of Paris; the College Louis-le-Grand became a
normal school to train teachers; salaries were established at what
seemed a reasonable rate; teachers were exempted from municipal duties,
and were promised a pension on complet- ing their term of service.
Benedictines, Oratorians, and Christian Brothers were accepted as
teachers, but the philosophies campaigned against them, and with some
effect. Catholic doctrine was still a substantial part of the
curriculum, but science and modern philosophy began to displace Aris-
totle and the Scholastics, and some lay teachers managed to convey the
ideas of the philosophes.’’ 9 Laboratories were set up in the colleges,
with professors of experimental physics, and technical and military
schools were opened in Paris and the provinces. There were several
warnings that the new curriculum would improve intellect rather than
character, would weaken morality and discipline, and lead to revolution.
80</p>
<p>The philosophes, however, pinned all their hopes for the future on
the reform of education. Generally they believed that man was by nature
good, and that some false or wicked turns of priestcraft or politics had
depraved him; all he had to do was to cleanse himself of artifice and go
back to “nature”— which no one satisfactorily defined. This, as we shall
see, was the essence of Rousseau. We have noted Helvetius’ faith that
“education can change everything.” 81 Even the skeptical Voltaire, in
some moods, thought that “we are a species of monkey that can be taught
to act reasonably or unreasonably.” 82 The belief in the indefinite
possibilities of progress through the improvement and extension of
education became a sustaining dogma of the new religion. Heaven and
utopia are the rival buckets that hover over the well of fate: when one
goes down the other goes up; hope draws up one or the other in turn.
Perhaps when both buckets come up empty a civilization loses heart and
begins to die.</p>
<p>Turgot formulated the new faith in a lecture at the Sorbonne on De-
cember ii, 1750, on “The Successive Advances of the Human Mind.”</p>
<p>The human race, viewed from its earliest beginning, presents
itself</p>
<p>o the eye of the philosopher as a vast whole which, like every
in-</p>
<p>dividual being, has its time of childhood and progress…. Man-</p>
<p>ners become gentler; the mind becomes more enlightened; nations,
hitherto living in isolation, draw nearer to one another; trade and</p>
<p>political relations link up the various quarters of the globe; and
the</p>
<p>whole body of mankind, through vicissitudes of calm and tempest, of
fair days and foul, continues its onward march, albeit with tardy</p>
<p>steps, toward an ever-nearing perfection. 83</p>
<p>77&lt;* THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Voltaire hesitantly agreed:</p>
<p>We may believe that reason and industry will always progress</p>
<p>more and more; that the useful arts will be improved; that of the
evils which afflict men, prejudices — which are not their least scourge
— will gradually disappear among all those who govern nations; and
that</p>
<p>philosophy, universally diffused, will give some consolation to
the</p>
<p>human spirit for the calamities which it will experience in all ages.
84 The dying philosophe hailed Turgot’s rise to power in 1774, for he
had no faith in the masses, and had attached his hopes to the
enlightenment of kings. We cannot educate the canaille, as he called the
commonalty of mankind; they are worn out with toil before they learn to
think; but we can educate a few men who, nearing the top, may educate
the monarch. This dream of “enlightened despots” as the leaders of human
advance was the precarious these royale upon which most of the
philosophes rested their vision of progress. They had many premonitions
of revolution, but they feared rather than desired it; they trusted that
reason would win the gov- erning class, that ministers and rulers would
listen to philosophy, and that they would effect the reforms that would
avert revolution and set man- kind on the road to happiness. So they
hailed the reforms of Frederick II; they forgave the sins of Catherine
II; and had they lived they would have rejoiced in Joseph II of Austria.
And what is our faith in government but that hope revived?</p>
<p>V. THE NEW MORALITY</p>
<p>A tantalizing problem remained. Could a state survive without a
re-</p>
<p>ligion to buttress social order with supernatural hopes and fears?
Could popular morality be maintained without popular belief in the
divine origin of the moral code, and in a God who saw everything, who
rewarded and avenged? The philosophes (excepting Voltaire) claimed that
such motives were not needed for morality; granting that this might be
true about the cultured few, was it true about the rest? And was the
morality of the cul- tured few an ethical echo of the faith they had
lost, of the religious rearing they had received?</p>
<p>The philosophes gambled on the efficacy of a natural ethic. Voltaire
had his doubts about it, but Diderot, d’Alembert, Helvetius, d’Holbach,
Mably, Turgot, and others argued for a morality that would be independ-
ent of theology, and therefore strong enough to survive the vicissitudes
of belief. Bayle had led the way by arguing that atheists would be just
as moral as believers; but he had defined morality as the habit of
conformity</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>with reason, he had assumed that man is a rational animal, and he had
left reason undefined. Should society or the individual be judge of what
was reasonable? If “society” and the individual disagreed, what but
force could decide between them? Would social order be merely a contest
between the enforcement and the evasion of the law, and would morality
merely calculate the chances of detection? F. V. Toussaint had expounded
a natu- ral ethic in Les Moeurs (1748); he too had defined virtue as
“fidelity in fulfilling the obligations imposed by reason”; 85 but how
many men could reason, or did reason if they could? And was not
character (which deter- mined action) formed before reason developed,
and was not reason the harlot of the strongest desire? These were some
of the problems that con- fronted a natural ethic.</p>
<p>Most of the philosophes accepted the universality of self-love as the
basic source of all conscious action, but they trusted that education,
legislation, and reason could turn self-love to mutual co-operation and
social order. D’Alembert confidently rested natural morality on</p>
<p>one single and incontrovertible fact — the need that men have of one
another, and the reciprocal obligations which that need imposes. This
much being granted, all the moral laws follow from it in orderly and
ineluctable sequence. All questions that have to do with morals have a
solution ready to hand in the heart of each one of us — a solution</p>
<p>which our passions sometimes circumvent, but which they never</p>
<p>destroy. And the solution of each particular question leads… to</p>
<p>he parent stem, and that, of course, is our own self-interest
which</p>
<p>is the basic principle of all moral obligations. 86</p>
<p>Some of the philosophes recognized that this assumed a general pre-
dominance of reason in the generality of men — that is, a self-interest
suf- ficiently “enlightened” to see the results of the ego’s choice in a
perspective large enough to reconcile the selfishness of the individual
with the good of the group. Voltaire did not share this trust in the
intelligence of egoism; reasoning seemed to him a very exceptional
operation. He preferred to base his ethic on the reality of an altruism
independent of self-love, and he de- rived this altruism from a sense of
justice infused into men by God. The freres condemned him as
surrendering the case to religion.</p>
<p>Having assumed the universality of self-love, the philosophes in
general concluded that happiness is the supreme good, and that all
pleasures are permissible if they do no harm to the group or to the
individual himself. Borrowing the methods of the Church, Grimm,
d’Holbach, Mably, and Saint-Lambert wrote catechisms expounding the new
morality. Saint- Lambert addressed his Catechisme universel to children
of twelve or thir- teen years:</p>
<p>77 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Q. What is man?</p>
<p>A. A being possessed of feeling and understanding.</p>
<p>Q. That being so, what should he do?</p>
<p>A. Pursue pleasure and avoid pain.</p>
<p>Q. Is this not self-love?</p>
<p>A. It is the necessary effect thereof.</p>
<p>Q. Does self-love exist in all men alike?</p>
<p>A. It does, because all men aim at self-preservation and at
attain-</p>
<p>ing happiness.</p>
<p>Q. What do you understand by happiness?</p>
<p>A. A continuous state in which we experience more pleasure than</p>
<p>pain.</p>
<p>Q. What must we do to attain this state?</p>
<p>A. Cultivate our reason and act in accord therewith.</p>
<p>Q. What is reason?</p>
<p>A. The knowledge of truths that conduce to our well-being.</p>
<p>Q. Does not self-love always lead us to discover those truths and</p>
<p>act in accord with them?</p>
<p>A. No, for all men do not know how self-love should be practiced.</p>
<p>Q. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>A. I mean that some men love themselves rightly, and others</p>
<p>wrongly.</p>
<p>Q. Who are those who love themselves rightly?</p>
<p>A. Those who seek to know one another, and who do not separate</p>
<p>heir own happiness from the happiness of others. 87</p>
<p>In their practical ethics the philosophies built upon their memories
of Christian morality. For the worship of God, Mary, and the saints,
which had indirectly aided morality, they substituted direct devotion to
mankind. The Abbe de Saint-Pierre had proposed a new word for an old
virtue — bienfaisance, which we weakly translate as beneficence, but
which meant active mutual aid, and co-operation with others in common
beneficent tasks. Along with this the philosophes stressed humanite,
which meant humaneness, humanitarianism. This had its roots in the
second of the two commandments enunciated by Christ. Raynal, when he
branded as inhuman the cruelty of Europeans to Negroes and Indians (East
and West), must have known that a Spanish bishop, Las Casas, had led the
way in such con- demnation in 1539. But the fresh enthusiasm for helping
the poor, the sick, and the oppressed was due chiefly to the
philosophes, and above all to Vol- taire. To his persistent campaigns
was due the reform of law in France. The French clergy had been noted
for their charity, but they now had the experience of seeing the
practical ethics of Christianity preached with re- markable success by
the philosophes. Morality grew more independent of religion; in the
fields of humaneness, sympathy, toleration, philanthropy,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE Philosophes</p>
<p>779</p>
<p>and peace it passed from a theological to a secular basis, and
influenced society as seldom before.</p>
<p>Faced with the moral problems generated by war, the philosophes</p>
<p>avoided pacifism while counseling peace. Voltaire admitted wars of
de- fense, but he argued that war is robbery, that it impoverishes the
victorious nation as well as the defeated, that it enriches only a few
princes, war con- tractors, and royal mistresses. He protested
Frederick’s invasion of Silesia and probably had it in mind when, in a
passionate article, “War,” in the Dictionnaire philosophique, he
explained how easily a royal conscience can be reconciled to
aggression:</p>
<p>A genealogist proves to a prince that he descends in a direct
line</p>
<p>from a count, whose parents made a family compact three or four</p>
<p>centuries ago with a house the memory of which does not even exist.
That house had distant pretensions to a province…. The prince</p>
<p>and his council see his right at once. This province, which is some
hun- dred leagues distant from him, in vain protests that it knows him
not, that it has no desire to be governed by him, that to give laws to
its</p>
<p>people he must at least have their consent…. He immediately assem-
bles a great number of men who have nothing to lose, dresses them in
coarse blue cloth,… makes them turn to the right and left, and</p>
<p>marches to glory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Voltaire advised Catherine II to take up arms and drive
the Turks from Europe; he wrote a patriotic elegy for the officers who
had died for France in 1741; and he blessed the army of France in its
victory at Fontenoy.</p>
<p>The philosophes rejected nationalism and patriotism on the ground
that these emotions narrowed the conceptions of humanity and moral
obliga- tion and made it easier for kings to lead their people into war.
The article “Patrie” in the Dictionnaire philosophique condemned
patriotism as in - corporated egotism. Voltaire begged the French to
moderate their boast- ing of superiority in language, literature, art,
and war, and reminded them of their faults, crimes, and defects. 88
Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, and d’Alembert in France, like Lessing ,
Kant, Herder, Goethe, and Schiller in Germany, were “good Europeans,”
and Frenchmen or Germans after - ward. As one religion and one language
had promoted cosmopolitanism in Western Europe in the Middle Ages, so
cosmopolitanism developed on the Continent as a result of the spread of
the French language and culture. Rousseau in 1755 spoke of “those great
cosmopolitan minds that make light of the barriers designed to sunder
nation from nation, and who, like the Sovereign Power that created them,
embrace all mankind within the scope of their benevolence.” 89 Elsewhere
he wrote, with characteristic exaggera -</p>
<p>780</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>ion: “There are no longer Frenchmen or Germans,… there are only
Europeans.”™ This was true only of the nobility and the intelligentsia,
but in those strata the cosmopolitan spirit extended from Paris to
Naples and St. Petersburg. Even in wartime aristocrats and literati
mingled with others of their class across frontiers; Hume, Horace
Walpole, Gibbon, and Adam Smith were welcomed in Parisian society while
England and France were at war, and the Prince de Ligne felt at home in
almost any European capital. Soldiers too had a bit of this
internationalism. “Every German officer,” said Duke Ferdinand of
Brunswick, “should feel honored to serve under the French flag”; 91 an
entire regiment in the French army— the Allemands Royaux — was composed
of Germans. The Revolution put an end to this cosmopolitan camaraderie
of manners and minds; the ascendancy of France faded, and nationalism
advanced.</p>
<p>So the intellectual revolt, which in part had risen out of a moral
revulsion against the cruelties of gods and priests, passed from a
rejection of the old theology to an ethic of universal brotherhood that
was derived from the finest aspect of the superseded faith. But the
question whether a moral code unsupported by religion could maintain
social order remained un- solved. It is still with us; we live in that
critical experiment.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>RELIGION IN RETREAT</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, for the time being, the philosophes appeared to have won
their war against Christianity. That admirably impartial historian Henri
Martin described the people of France in 1762 as “a ge neration which
had no belief in Christianity.” 92 In 1770 the avocat general Seguier
reported:</p>
<p>The philosophes have with one hand sought to shake the throne,</p>
<p>and with the other to upset the altars. Their purpose was to change
public opinion on civil and religious institutions, and that revolution,
so to speak, has been effected. History and poetry, romances and even
dictionaries have been infected with the poison of incredulity. Their
writings are hardly published before they inundate the provinces like a
torrent. The contagion has spread into workshops and cottages. 93</p>
<p>As if to illustrate this report, Sylvan Marechal compiled in 1771 a
Diction- naire des athees, which he expanded somewhat by including
Abelard, Boc- caccio, and Bishop Berkeley. 94 In 1775 the Archbishop of
Toulouse de- clared that u le monstrueux atheisme est devenu Fopinion do
7 ninante” as Mme. du Deffand supposed that belief in the Christian
miracles was as extinct as belief in the Greek mythology. 96 The Devil
survived as an ex- pletive, hell as a jest; 97 and the heaven of
theology had been upset in space</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>7 8l</p>
<p>by the new astronomy, just as it recedes from space with the
planetary explorations of our age. De Tocqueville spoke in 1856 of “the
universal discredit into which all religious belief fell at the end of
the eighteenth century.” 98</p>
<p>All these statements were exaggerated, and were probably made with
Paris and the upper and literate classes in mind. Lecky’s judgment was
more discriminating: “The anti -Christian literature represented the
opin- ions, and met the demands, of the great body of the educated
classes; and crowds of administrators in all departments [of the
government] connived at, or favored, its circulation.” 99 The French
masses still cherished the medieval faith as the prop and poetry of
their toilsome lives. They accepted not only old miracles but new ones.
Peddlers found a profitable market for miracle-working statuettes of the
Virgin. 100 Statues and relics were carried in processions to avert or
end some public calamity. The churches, even in Paris, were filled on
the great festivals of the religious year, and the church bells caroled
through the city their reverberating invitations. Re- ligious
confraternities numbered many members, at least in the provincial towns.
“Frere” Servan, writing from Grenoble to d’Alembert (1767),</p>
<p>assured him: “You would be astonished at the progress of philosophy
in these barbarous regions”; and at Dijon there were sixty sets of the
En - cyclopedic. But these cases were exceptional; by and large the
provincial bourgeoisie remained faithful to the Church.</p>
<p>In Paris the new movement reached every class. The workers were in-
creasingly anticlerical; the cafes had long since dismissed God. A
noble- man told how his hairdresser said to him, while powdering his
hair: “You see, sir, though I am a miserable scrub, I have no more
religion than any- one else.” 101 The wome n of the proletariat carried
on the old worship, and fondly fingered their rosaries. Fashionable
women, however, followed the philosophic mode, dispensing with religion
until they reached desiccation; nearly all of them sent for the priest
when they were sure of imminent death. Most of the major salons belonged
to the philosophies. Mme. du Deffand despised these men, but Mme.
Geoffrin let them dominate her dinners; d’Alembert, Turgot, and
Condorcet reigned around Mile, de Lespinasse, and Grimm presid ed for
Mme. d’fipinay. Horace Walpole de - scribed the intellectual atmosphere
of the salons in 1765:</p>
<p>There is God and the King to be pulled down;… men and</p>
<p>women are devoutly employed in the demolition. They think me</p>
<p>quite profane for having any belief left. 102… The philosophes are
insupportable, superficial, overbearing, and fanatic; they preach
in-</p>
<p>cessantly, and their avowed doctrine is atheism; you would not</p>
<p>believe how openly. Don’t wonder, therefore, if I should return a</p>
<p>Jesuit. 103</p>
<p>782</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Academy chose nine philosophies to its membership in
the fourteen elections between 1760 and 1770; and in 1772 it made
d’Alembert its permanent secretary.</p>
<p>The nobles consumed with anticlerical delight the offerings of the
esprits forts. “Atheism was universal in high society,” reported Lamothe
-Langon; “to believe in God was an invitation to ridicule.” 104 “After
1771 irreligion prevailed in the aristocrac y.” 105 The Duchesse
d’Enville and the Duchesses de Choiseul, Gramont, Montesson, and Tesse
were deists. Men high in the government — Choiseul, Rohan, Maurepas,
Beauvau, Chauvelin — mingled amiably with d’Alembert, Turgot, Condorcet.
Meanwhile the philoso phes explained to France that feudalism had
outlived its usefulness, that heredi- tary privileges were injustice
fossilized, that a good shoemaker is better than a wastrel lord, and
that all power stems from the people.</p>
<p>Even the clergy took the contagion. Chamfort in 1 769 measured the
de- gree of sacerdotal unbelief with the grades of the hierarchy: “The
priest must believe a little;… the vicar can smile at a proposition
against re- ligion; the bishop laughs outright; the cardinal adds his
own quip.” 106 Diderot and d’Holbach numbered several skeptical abbes
among their friends. The Abbes Torne, Fauchet, Maury, de Beauvais, and
de Boulogne “were among the most outspoken of the philosophes” 101 We
hear of a “Societe de Pretres Beaux - Esprits”; some of these “witty
priests” were deists, some were atheists — Mesliers come to life.
Priestley, dining with Turgot in 1774, was informed by the Marquis de
Chastellux “that the two gentlemen opposite were the Bishop of Aix and
the Archbishop of Tou- louse, but ‘they are no more believers than you
or I.’ I assured him that I was a believer, and M. Le Roy, the
philosopher, told me that I was the only man of sense he knew that was a
Christian.” 108</p>
<p>Even in the monasteries atheism had some friends. Dom Collignon, to
avoid scandal, had his two mistresses at his table only when his other
guests were trusted friends; he did not allow the Apostles’ Creed to
interfere with his pleasures, but he considered religion an admirable
institution for maintaining morals among commoners. 100 Diderot told
(1769) of a day he had passed with two monks:</p>
<p>One of them read the first draft of a very fresh and very
vigorous</p>
<p>reatise on atheism, full of new and bold ideas; I learned with
edifica- tion that this was the current doctrine in their cloisters. For
the rest, these two monks were the “big bonnets” of their monasteries.
They had intellect, gaiety, good feeling, knowledge. 110</p>
<p>A fervent Catholic historian tells us that toward the end of the
eighteenth century “a sentiment of contempt, exaggerated but universal,
had replaced</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOphes 783</p>
<p>everywhere the profound veneration which the great monasteries had so
long inspired in the Catholic world.” 111</p>
<p>The growth of toleration resulted chiefly from the decline of
religious belief; it is easier to be tolerant when we are indifferent.
Voltaire’s success in the cases of Calas and the Sirvens moved several
provincial governors to recommend to the central government a mitigation
of the laws against Protestants. This was done. The edicts against
heresy were not repealed, but they were only mildly enforced; the
Huguenots were left in peace, as Voltaire had proposed. The Parlement of
Toulouse showed its repentance by extending toleration to a degree that
alarmed the King. 112 Some prelates — e.g., Bishop Fitzjames of Soissons
in 1757 — issued a pastoral letter calling upon all Christians to regard
all men as brothers. 113</p>
<p>Voltaire gave philosophy the credit for this victory. “It seems to
me,” he wrote to d’Alembert in 1764, “that only the philosophers have in
some measure softened the manners of men, and that without them we would
have two or three St. Bartho lomew Massacres in every century.” 114 We
must note again that the philosophes themselves were sometimes
intolerant. D’Alembert and Marmontel exhorted Malesherbes to suppress
Freron (1757), 115 and d’Alembert asked him to prosecute some critics of
the E n- cyclopedic (1758). Mme. Helvetius urged him to silence a
journal that had vilified her husband’s De l’ Esprit (1758). Voltaire on
several occasions begged the authorities to suppress parodies and libels
against the philosophic group; 116 and so far as these were real libels
— injurious falsehoods — he was justified.</p>
<p>There were other factors besides philosophy in promoting toleration.
The Reformation, though it sanctioned intolerance, generated so many
sects (several of them strong enough to defend themselves) that
intolerance seldom dared go beyond words. The sects had to dispute by
argument, and they unwillingly accepted the test — and promoted the
prestige — of reason. The memory of the “religious” w ars in France,
England, and Ger- many, and of the economic losses thereby incurred,
turned many economic and political leaders to toleration. Mercantile
centers like Hamburg, Am- sterdam, and London found it necessary to put
up with the different creeds and customs of their customers. The growing
strength of the nationalist state made it more independent of religious
unity as a means of maintain- ing social order. The spread of
acquaintance with different civilizations and cults weakened the
confidence of each faith in its monopoly of God. Above all, the advances
of science made it difficult for religious dogma to proceed to
barbarities like the trials of the Inquisition and the executions for
witchcraft. The philosophes embraced most of these influences in their
propaganda for toleration, and could reasonably claim much credit
for</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>he victory. It was a measure of their success that whereas in the
first half of the eighteenth century Huguenot preachers were still being
hanged in France, in 1776 and 1778 a Swiss Protestant was summoned by a
Catholic king to save the state.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>SUMMING UP</li>
</ol>
<p>So we end as we began, by perceiving that it was the philosophers and
the theologians, not the warriors and diplomats, who were fighting the
crucial battle of the eighteenth century, and that we were justified in
call- ing that period the Age of Voltaire. “The philosophers of
different na - tions,” said Condorcet, “em bracing in their meditations
the entire interests of mankind,… formed a firm and united phalanx
against every descrip- tion of error and every species of tyranny.” 117
It was by no means a united phalanx; we shall see Rousseau leaving the
ranks, and Kant striving to reconcile philosophy and religion. But it
was truly a struggle for the soul of man, and the results are with us
today.</p>
<p>By the time Voltaire left Ferney for his triumph in Paris (1778),
the</p>
<p>movement that he had led had become the dominant power in European
thought. Freron, its devoted enemy, described it as “the malady and
folly of the age.” 118 The Jesuits had fled, and the Jansenists were in
retreat. The whole tone of French society had changed. Nearly every
writer in France followed the line and sought the approval of the
philosophes; philosophic was in a hundred titles and a thousand mouths;
“a word of praise from Voltaire, Diderot, or d’Alembert was more valued
than the favor of a prince.” 119 The salons and the Academy, sometimes
even the King’s minis - try, were in “philosophic” hands.</p>
<p>Foreign visitors angled for admission to salons where they might meet
and hear the famous philosophes; returning to their own lands, they
spread the new ideas. Hume, though in many of his views he preceded
Voltaire, looked up to him as a master; Robertson sent to Ferney his
splendid Charles V; Chesterfield, Horace Walpole, and Garrick were among
a</p>
<p>score of Voltaire’s English correspondents; Sm ollett, Franklin, and
others joined in preparing an English translation and edition of
Voltaire’s works in thirty-seven volumes (1762). In America the founders
of the new re- public were deeply stirred by the writings of the
philosophes. As to Ger- man y, hear Goethe’s remarks to Eckermann in
1820 and 1831:</p>
<p>You have no idea of the influence which Voltaire and his great</p>
<p>contemporaries had in my youth, and how they governed the [mind of
the] whole civilized world…. It seems to me quite extraordinary</p>
<p>o see what men the French had in their literature in the last
century.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>THE TRIUMPH OF THE PhiloSOpheS</p>
<p>785</p>
<p>I am astonished when I merely look at it. It was the
metamorphosis</p>
<p>of a hundred-year-old literature, which had been growing ever since
Louis XIV, and now stood in full flower. 120</p>
<p>Kings and queens joined in acclaiming Voltaire, and proudly listed
them- selves among his followers. Frederick the Great had been among the
first to sense his importance; now in 1767, after thirty years of
knowing him in all the faults of his character and the brilliance of his
mind, he hailed the triumph of the campaign against Finfdme: “The
edifice [of supersti - tion] is sapped to its f oundations,” and “the
nations will write in their an - nals that Voltaire was the promoter of
this revolution that is taking place, in the eighteenth century, in the
human spirit.” 121 Catherine II of Russia and Gustavus III of Sweden
joined in this adulation; and though the Em- peror Joseph II could not
so openly declare himself, he unquestionably owed to the philosophes the
spirit of his reforms. Admirers of Voltaire rose to power in Catholic
Milan, Parma, Naples, even Madrid. Grimm summed up the si tuation in
1767: “It gives me pleasure to note that an immense republic of
cultivated spirits is being formed in Europe. Enlight- enment is
spreading on all sides.” 122</p>
<p>Voltaire himself, overcoming the natural pessimism of old age,
sounded a note of victory in 1 77 1 :</p>
<p>Well-constituted minds are now very numerous; they are at the</p>
<p>head of nations; they influence public manners; and year by year the
fanaticism that overspread the earth is receding in its detestable usur-
pations…. If religion no longer gives birth to civil wars, it is to</p>
<p>philosophy alone that we are indebted; theological disputes begin to
be regarded in much the same manner as the quarrels of Punch and Judy at
the fair. A usurpation odious and injurious, founded upon</p>
<p>fraud on one side and stupidity on the other, is being at every
instant undermined by reason, which is establishing its reign. 123</p>
<p>Let us give him his due. We may admit, with our hindsight knowledge
of the Revolution’s excesses and o f the reaction that followed, that
the philosophes (excepting Voltaire) had too sanguine a confidence in
human nature; that they underestimated the force of instincts generated
in thou- sands of years of insecurity, savagery, and barbarism; that
they exaggerated the power of education to develop reason as a
sufficient controller of those instincts; that they were blind to the
demands of imagination and senti- ment, and deaf to the cry of the
defeated for the consolations of belief. They gave too little weight to
traditions and institutions produced by cen- turies of trial and error,
and too great weight to the individual intellect that at best is the
product of a brief and narrow life. But if these were serious</p>
<p>786</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>misjudgments, they were rooted not merely in intellectual pride but
also in a generous aspiration for human betterment. To the
eighteenth-century thinkers — and to the perhaps profounder philosophers
of the seventeenth — we owe the relative freedom that we enjoy in our
thought and speech and creeds; we owe the multiplication of schools,
libraries, and universities; we owe a hundred humane reforms in law and
government, in the treat- ment of crime, sickness, and insanity. To
them, and to the followers of Rousseau, we owe the immense stimulation
of mind that produced the literature, science, philosophy, and
statesmanship of the nineteenth century. Because of them our religions
can free themselves more and more from a dulling superstition and a
sadistic theology, can turn their backs upon obscurantism and
persecution, and can recognize the need for mutual sym- pathy in the
diverse tentatives of our ignorance and our hope. Because of those men
we, here and now, can write without fear, though not without reproach.
When we cease to honor Voltaire we shall be unworthy of freedom.</p>
<p>Epilogue in Elysium</p>
<p>Persons of the Dialogue: Pope Benedict XIV and Voltaire</p>
<p>Scene: A place in the grateful memory of mankind</p>
<p>Benedict. I am happy to see you here, monsieur, for though you did
much damage to the Church which I was allowed to head for eighteen
years, you did much good in chastising the sins and errors of the
Church, and the injustices that shamed all of us in your time.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You are now, as you were in life, the most gracious and
for- giving of the popes. If every “servant of the servants of God” had
been like you I would have recognized the sins of the Church as the
natural property of men, and I would have continued to honor a great
institution. You will remember how, for over fifty years, I respected
the Jesuits.</p>
<p>Benedict. I remember, but I am sorry that you joined in the
attack</p>
<p>upon them just when they had moderated their political intrigues and
were standing up bravely against the licentiousness of the King.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I should have known better than to side with the Jansenists
in that argument.</p>
<p>Benedict. Well, you see that you too can make mistakes, just like
a</p>
<p>pope. And now that I have found you in a modest mood, will you let me
tell you why I remained faithful to the Church that you abandoned?</p>
<p>Voltaire. That would be most interesting.</p>
<p>Benedict. I’m afraid I shall tire you, for I shall have to do most of
the talking. But remember how many volumes you wrote.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I often longed to see Rome, and I should have been happy to
have you talk to me.</p>
<p>Benedict. And I often wished that I might speak with you. I must con-
fess that I enjoyed your wit and your artistry. But it was your
brilliance that led you astray. It is difficult to be brilliant and
conservative; there is little charm, for active minds, in standing for
tradition and authority; it is tempting to be critical, for then you can
feel the pleasure of individuality and novelty. But in philosophy it is
almost impossible to be original without being wrong. And I should like
to talk with you not as a priest or a theolo- gian, but as one
philosopher to another.</p>
<p>787</p>
<p>788</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>Voltaire. Thank you. There has been considerable doubt as to my</p>
<p>being a philosopher.</p>
<p>Benedict. You had the good sense not to fabricate a new system. But
you made a fundamental and grievous mistake.</p>
<p>V oltaire. What was that one?</p>
<p>Benedict. You thought it possible for one mind, in one lifetime, to
ac- quire such scope of knowledge and depth of understanding as to be
fit to sit in judgment upon the wisdom of the race — upon traditions and
institu- tions that have taken form out of the experience of centuries.
Tradition is to the group what memory is to the individual; and just as
the snapping of memory may bring insanity, so a sudden break with
tradition may plunge a whole nation into madness, like France in the
Revolution.</p>
<p>Voltaire. France did not go mad; it. concentrated into a decade
the</p>
<p>resentment accumulated during centuries of oppression. Besides, the
“race”</p>
<p>Benedict. The success or failure of ideas in the experiments of com-
munities and nations has determined the survival of some ideas and the
loss of the rest.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I am not so sure. Perhaps prejudice robed in authority
de-</p>
<p>ermined in many cases what ideas should be preserved, and censorship
may have prevented a thousand good ideas from entering into the
traditions of the race.</p>
<p>Benedict. I suppose my predecessors thought of censorship as a means
of preventing the spread of ideas that would destroy the moral basis of
social order, and the inspiring beliefs that help humanity to bear the
bur- dens of life. I will admit that our censors made some grave
mistakes, as in the case of Galileo — though I think we were more gentle
with him than your followers have led many people to believe.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Tradition, then, is capable of being wrong and
oppressive,</p>
<p>and an impediment to the advancement of understanding. How can man
progress if he is forbidden to question tradition?</p>
<p>Benedict. Perhaps we should question progress too, but let us put
that problem aside for the present. I believe that we should be allowed
to ques- tion traditions and institutions, but with care that we do not
destroy more than we can build, and with caution that the stone that we
dislodge shall not prove to be a necessary support to what we wish to
preserve, and al- ways with a modest consciousness that the experience
of generations may be wiser than the reason of a transitory
individual.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE IN ELYSIUM</p>
<p>789</p>
<p>Voltaire. And yet reason is the noblest gift that God has given
us.</p>
<p>Benedict. No; love is. I do not wish to belittle reason, but it
should be the servant of love, not of pride.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I often admitted the frailty of reason, I know that it
tends to prove anything suggested by our desires; and my distant friend
Diderot wrote somewhere that the truths of feeling are more unshakable
than the truths of logical demonstration. 1 The true skeptic will doubt
reason too. Perhaps I exaggerated reason because that madman Rousseau
exaggerated feeling. To subordinate reason to feeling is, to my mind,
more disastrous than to subordinate feeling to reason.</p>
<p>Benedict. The whole man needs both in their interplay. But now I</p>
<p>wonder will you accompany me in a further step? Won’t you agree
that</p>
<p>Voltaire. Well?</p>
<p>Benedict. So we know thought more immediately than we know any- thing
else?</p>
<p>Voltaire. I wonder. I believe that we know things long before we turn
into ourselves and realize that we are thinking.</p>
<p>Benedict. But confess that when you look within you perceive a
re-</p>
<p>ality entirely different from the matter to which you were sometimes
in- clined to reduce everything.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I had my doubts about it. But proceed.</p>
<p>Benedict. Confess, too, that what you perceive when you look within
is some reality of choice, some freedom of will.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You go too fast, Father. I once believed that I enjoyed
a</p>
<p>moderate degree of freedom, but logic forced me to accept
determinism.</p>
<p>Benedict. That is, you surrendered what you immediately perceived to
what you concluded from a long and precarious process of reasoning.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I couldn’t refute that tough little lens -grinder Spinoza.
Have you read Spinoza?</p>
<p>Benedict. Of course. A pope is not bound by the Index
Expurgatorius.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You know that we considered him an atheist.</p>
<p>Benedict. We mustn’t throw epithets at one another. He was a lovable
fellow, but unbearably gloomy. He saw God so universally that he left no
room for human personality. He was as religious as Augustine, and as
great a saint.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I love you, Benedict; you are kinder to him than I was.</p>
<p>Benedict. Let’s get on. I ask you to agree that thought,
consciousness, and the sense of personality are the realities most
directly known to us.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Very well; granted.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>Benedict. So I feel justified in rejecting materialism, atheism, and
de- terminism. Each of us is a soul. Religion builds on that fact.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Suppose all that; how does it warrant the mass of
absurdities that were added, century after century, to the creed of the
Church?</p>
<p>Benedict. There were many absurdities, I know. Many incredibilities.
But the people cry out for them, and in several instances the Church, in
accepting such marvels into her creed, yielded to persistent and
widespread popular demand. If you take from the people the beliefs we
allow them to hold, they will adopt legends and superstitions beyond
control. Organ- ized religion does not invent superstition, it checks
it. Destroy an organized faith, and it will be replaced by that
wilderness of disorderly superstitions that are now arising like maggots
in the wounds of Christianity. And even so, there are more
incredibilities in science than in religion. Is there any- thing more
incredible than the belief that the condition of some primeval nebula
determined and compelled every line in your plays?</p>
<p>Voltaire. But those stories about asbestos saints who couldn’t be</p>
<p>burned, and a decapitated saint walking with his head in his hand,
and Mary lifted up into heaven — I just couldn’t stomach them.</p>
<p>Benedict. You always had a weak stomach. The people make no diffi-
culty about them, for these stories are part of a creed that gives
support and consolation to their lives. That is why they will never
listen to you for long, since the breath of their life depends upon not
hearing you. So, in the struggle between faith and unbelief, faith
always wins. See how Ca- tholicism is winning Western Germany, regaining
your infidel France, holding Latin America, and rising to power in North
America, even in the land of the Pilgrims and the Puritans.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Sometimes, Father, I think your religion recovers not</p>
<p>hrough the truth of your creed, nor through the attractiveness of
your myths, not even through your clever use of drama and art, but
through your devilishly subtle encouragement of fertility among your
people. I per- ceive that the birth rate is the chief enemy of
philosophy. We breed from the bottom and die at the top; and the
fertility of simplicity defeats the activity of intelligence.</p>
<p>Benedict. You are mistaken if you think that our birth rate is the
secret of our success; something far profounder is involved. Shall I
tell you why intelligent people all over the world are returning to
religion?</p>
<p>Voltaire. Because they are tired of thinking.</p>
<p>Benedict. Not quite. They have discovered that your philosophy has no
answer but ignorance and despair. And wise men perceive that all at-
tempts at what your brethren called a natural ethic have failed. You and
I probably agree that man is born with individualistic instincts formed
in thousands of years of primitive conditions; that his social instincts
are rela-</p>
<p>EPILOGUE IN ELYSIUM</p>
<p>791</p>
<p>ively weak; and that a strong code of morals and laws is needed to
tame this natural anarchist into a normally peaceful citizen. Our
theologians called those individualisti c instincts original sin,
inherited from our “first parents”— that is, from those harassed,
lawless men, ever endangered hunt- ers, who had always to be ready to
fight and kill for food or mates; who had to be violently acquisitive,
and pugnacious, and cruel, because whatever social organization they had
was still weak, and they had to depend upon themselves for security in
their lives and possessions.</p>
<p>V oltaire. You are not talking like a pope.</p>
<p>Benedict. I told you we should talk like philosophers. A pope too can
be a philosopher, but he has to express the conclusions of philosophy in
terms not only intelligible to the people, but capable of influencing
their emotions and conduct. We are convinced — and the world is
returning to us because it is learning — that no moral code of
confessedly human origin will be sufficiently impressive to control the
unsocial impulses of the natural man. Our people are held up in their
moral life — though this is uncongenial to the flesh — by a moral code
taught them in their formative childhood as part of their religion, and
as the word not of man but of God. You wish to keep the morality and
discard the theology; but it is the theology that makes the morality
sink into the soul. We must make the moral code an inseparable part of
that religious belief which is man’s most precious pos - session; for
only through such belief does life acquire a meaning and a dignity that
can support and ennoble our existence.</p>
<p>Voltaire. So Moses invented those conversations with God?</p>
<p>Benedict. No mature mind asks such a question.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You are quite right.</p>
<p>Benedict. I forgive your immature sarcasm. Certainly Hammurabi,</p>
<p>Lycurgus, and Numa Pompilius were wise in recognizing that morality
must be given a religious foundation if it is not to crumble under the
per- sistent attacks of our strongest instincts. You too accepted this
when you talked about a rewarding and punishing God. You wanted your
servants to have religion, but you thought your friends could get along
without it.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I still think that philosophers can dispense with it.</p>
<p>Benedict. How naive you are! Are children capable of philosophy?</p>
<p>Can children reason? Society is based upon morality, morality is
based upon character, character is formed in childhood and youth long
before reason can be a guide. We must infuse morality into the
individual when he is young and malleable; then it may be strong enough
to withstand his indi- vidualistic impulses, even his indiv idualistic
reasoning. I’m afraid you began to think too soon. The intellect is a
constitutional individualist, and when it is uncontrolled by morality it
can tear a society to pieces.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>Voltaire. Some of the finest men of my time found reason a sufficient
morality.</p>
<p>Benedict. That was before the individualistic intellect had time to
over- come the effects of religion. A few men, like Spinoza and Bayle,
d’Holbach and Helvetius, may have led good lives after abandoning the
religion of their fathers; but how do we know that their virtues were
not the result of their religious education?</p>
<p>Voltaire. There were hundreds of people among my contemporaries who
were contemptible profligates despite religious educations and Catho-
lic orthodoxy, like Cardinal Dubois and Louis XV —</p>
<p>Benedict: Of whom you wrote a fulsome eulogy.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Alas, yes. I was like some of your monks; I used pious
frauds to obtain what I felt were good ends.</p>
<p>Benedict. However, there is no doubt that thousands of people ortho-
dox in faith — even people who attend to all the observances of religion
— can become great sinners and passionate criminals. Religion is no
infallible cure for crime, it is only a help in the great task of civ
ilizing mankind; we be- lieve that without it men would be far worse
than they are.</p>
<p>Voltaire. But that awful doctrine of hell turned God into an ogre
more cruel than any despot in history.</p>
<p>Benedict. You resent that doctrine, but if you knew men better
you</p>
<p>would understand that they must be frightened with fears as well as
en- couraged with hopes. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
When your followers lost that fear they began to deteriorate. You were
relatively decent in your immorality; there was something beautiful in
your long asso- ciation with Madame du Chatelet; but your relations with
your niece were disgraceful. And you found nothing to reproach in the
conduct of your lecherous friend the Due de Richelieu.</p>
<p>Voltaire. How could I reproach him? I would have endangered my</p>
<p>loans.</p>
<p>Benedict. You did not live long enough to see how atheism came close
to making man the most despicable of beasts. Have you read the Marquis
de Sade? During the ecstasy of the French Revolution he published three
novels 2 in which he explained that if there is no God, everything is
per- mitted except detection by the agents of the law. He pointed out
that many wicked people prosper on earth, and many good people suffer;
therefore, since there is no heaven or hell, there is no sense in being
good to the de- triment of our pleasures. He concluded that if the will
is not free, there is no moral responsibility; there is no right or
wrong, there are only weak and strong. Goodness is weakness, and
weakness is evil; even the pleasure of the strong in exploiting the weak
is justifiable. Cruelty, he argued, is nat- ural, and often pleasurable.
So he approved every form of pleasure, includ-</p>
<p>EPILOGUE IN ELYSIUM</p>
<p>793</p>
<p>ing the most disgusting and degenerate perversions, until at last the
sum- mum bonum seemed to lie in inflicting or receiving pain as a mode
of sexual delight.</p>
<p>Voltaire. That man should have been flogged to within an inch of
his</p>
<p>Benedict. Yes, if you could catch him; but if you couldn’t? Think
of</p>
<p>he countless crimes that are committed every day and are never
detected or never punished. You have to have a moral code that will
deter a man from crime even when he feels secure from detection. Is it
any wonder that the “Age of Voltaire” was one of the most immoral in
history? I will not say anything about your own Pucelle, but think of
the King’s Parc aux Cerfs, and the licentious literature that was
printed in great quantity, widely sold, and eagerly bought, even by
women. This reckless provision of erotic excitement becomes an obscene
flood in times and lands of un- belief.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You must know, your Holiness, that the sexual instinct
is</p>
<p>very strong, even in some popes, and that it will find expression
despite every law.</p>
<p>Benedict. Because of its strength it needs special controls, and
certainly no encouragement. That is why we tried to channel it within
orderly mar- riage, and did all we could to make early marriage
possible. In your modern societies you make marriage impossible for all
but reckless and improvident men until long after they reach sexual
maturity; yet you make continence difficult for them by stimulating
their sexual imagination and desire at every turn by literature and the
theater, under the shibboleth of freedom for the press and the
stage.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Our young people take no lasting harm from their
freedom.</p>
<p>Benedict. I think you are wrong. A man accustomed to promiscuity</p>
<p>before marriage will seldom prove a faithful husband; and a woman who
gives herself freely before marriage will only exceptionally make a
faithful wife. So you are driven to allow divorce on ever easier
conditions. We make marriage a solemn sacrament, a vow of lifelong
patience and fidelity; you make marriage a business contract, which
either party is free to cancel after a passing quarrel, or in prospect
of a younger or richer mate. Every home now has all its doors open,
inviting flight, and the institution of mar- riage falls into a chaos of
temporary and experimental unions tragic for women and fatal to moral
order.</p>
<p>Voltaire. But, my dear Father, monogamy is unnatural and
unbearable.</p>
<p>Benedict. All restraint of instinct is unnatural, and yet without
many such restraints society is impossible. And I believe that a man or
woman with one mate and several children is happier than a man or woman
with several mates and one child. How can a man be long happy who,
excited</p>
<p>794</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>by a new face and a pretty form, has divorced the wife who has lost
her beauty in bearing and rearing his children?</p>
<p>Voltaire. But by forbidding divorce you have had to tolerate the
adul- tery that is so widespread in Catholic countries.</p>
<p>Benedict. Yes, there we are weak and guilty; weak through the growth
of unbelief. Perhaps, because it allows an apparently united home for
the children, adultery is better than divorce, and involves a less
lasting derange- ment of the family; but I am ashamed that we have found
no better solution.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You are an honest man, Father. I would give all that I
ever</p>
<p>had if I could share your faith and your goodness.</p>
<p>Benedict. And yet you are so hard to convince! Sometimes I despair of
winning back brilliant men like you, whose pens move a million souls for
evil or for good. But some of your followers are opening their eyes to
the awful reality. The bubble of progress has exploded in a century that
has seen more wholesale murder of men and women, more devastation of
cities and desolation of hearts, than any other century in history.
Progress in knowledge, science, comforts, and power is only progress in
means; if there is no improvement in ends, purposes, or desires,
progress is a delusion. Rea- son improves the instrumentalities, but the
ends are determined by instincts formed before birth and established
before reason can grow.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I still have faith in human intelligence; we shall improve
ends as well as means as we become more secure in our lives.</p>
<p>Benedict. Are you becoming more secure? Is violent crime decreasing?
Is war less terrible than before? You hope against hope that the
destructive- ness of your weapons will deter you and your enemies from
war; but did the equivalent progress from the arrow to the bomb stop
nations from challenging each other to the death?</p>
<p>Voltaire. The education of the human race will take many
centuries.</p>
<p>Benedict. Meanwhile consider the spiritual devastation that your
prop- aganda has spread, perhaps more tragic than any ruin of cities. Is
not athe- ism the prelude to a profounder pessimism than believers have
ever known? And you, rich and famous, did you not often think of
suicide?</p>
<p>Voltaire. Yes. I tried to believe in God, but I confess to you that
God</p>
<p>meant nothing in my life, and that in my secret heart I too felt a
void where my childhood faith had been. But probably this feeling
belongs only to individuals and generations in transition; the
grandchildren of these pes- simists will frolic in the freedom of their
lives, and have more happiness than poor Christians darkened with fear
of hell.</p>
<p>Benedict. That fear played only a minor role in the lives of the
great majority of the faithful. What inspired them was the feeling that
the agony of death was not a meaningless obscenity but the prelude to a
larger life, in which all earthly injustices and cruelties would be
righted and healed, and</p>
<p>EPILOGUE IN ELYSIUM</p>
<p>795</p>
<p>hey would be united in happiness and peace with those whom they had
loved and lost.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Yes, that was a real comfort, however illusory. I didn’t
feel</p>
<p>it, because I hardly knew my mother, I seldom saw my father, and I
had no known children.</p>
<p>Benedict. You were not a complete man, and so your philosophy was not
complete. Did you ever know the life of the poor?</p>
<p>Voltaire. Only from the outside; but I tried to be just and helpful
to</p>
<p>he poor who lived on my estates.</p>
<p>Benedict. Yes, you were a good seigneur. And you saw to it that the
consoling faith of your people should be renewed by religious
instruction and worship. But meanwhile your desolating gospel of no hope
beyond the grave was being spread over France. Have you ever answered de
Musset’s question ? 3 After you or your followers have taught the poor
that the only heaven they can ever reach must be created by them on
earth, and after they have slaughtered their rulers, and new rulers
appear, and poverty re- mains, together with greater disorder and
insecurity than before — what comfort will you then be able to offer to
the defeated poor?</p>
<p>Voltaire. I did not recommend slaughtering their rulers; I suspected
that the new rulers would be much like the old, but with worse
manners.</p>
<p>Benedict. I will not say that revolution is never justified. But we
have learned, through the experience accumulated and transmitted by our
undy- ing hierarchy, that after every overturn there will soon again be
masters and men, rich and relatively poor. We are all born unequal, and
every new invention, every added complexity of life or thought,
increases the gap be- tween the simple and the clever, the weak and the
strong. Those hopeful revolutionists talked of liberty, and equality,
and fraternity. But these idols never get along together. If you
establish liberty you let natural inequalities multiply into artificial
inequalities; and to check these you have to restrain liberty; so your
utopias of freedom sometimes become straitjackets of des- potism, and in
the turmoil fraternity becomes only a phrase.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Yes, it is so.</p>
<p>Benedict. Well, then, which of us offers the greater consolation to
the inevitably defeated majority? Do you think you will be doing a favor
to the toilers of France and Italy if you convince them that their
wayside shrines, their crosses, religious images, and devout offerings
are meaningless mummeries, and that their prayers are addressed to an
empty sky? Could there be any greater tragedy than that men should have
to believe that there is nothing in life but the struggle for existence,
and nothing certain in it but death?</p>
<p>Voltaire. I sympathize with your feeling, Father. I was touched
and</p>
<p>disturbed by a letter that came to me from Madame de Talmond. I
remember</p>
<p>79 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>it well: “I think, sir, that a philosopher should never write but to
endeavor to render mankind less wicked and unhappy than they are. Now,
you do quite the contrary. You are always writing against that religion
which alone is able to restrain wickedness and to afford consolation in
misfortune.” 4 But I have my faith, too — that in the long run truth
will be a blessing even to the poor.</p>
<p>Benedict. Truth is not truth unless it remains true through
generations. The past generations belie you, future generations will
reproach you. Even the victors in the struggle of life will reprove you
for taking from the poor the hopes that reconciled them to their humble
place in the inevitable strati- fication of any society.</p>
<p>Voltaire. I would not lend myself to such a double deception of
the</p>
<p>poor.</p>
<p>Benedict. We do not deceive them. We teach them faith, hope, and
charity, and all three are real boons to human life. You made miserable
jokes about the Trinity; but have you any notion of the comfort brought
to millions and millions of souls by the thought that God himself had
come down to this earth to share their sufferings and atone for their
sins? You laughed at the Virgin Birth, but is there in all literature a
more lovable and inspiring symbol of womanly modesty and maternal
love?</p>
<p>Voltaire. It is a beautiful story. If you had read all my
ninety-nine</p>
<p>volumes you would have noted that I acknowledged the value of conso-
latory myths. 5</p>
<p>Benedict. We do not admit that they are myths; they are among the
profoundest truths. Their effects are among the most certain facts of
his- tory. I will not speak of the art and music they have engendered,
which are among the richest portions of man’s heritage.</p>
<p>Voltaire. The art was excellent, but your Gregorian chant is a gloomy
bore.</p>
<p>Benedict. If you were profounder you would appreciate the value of
our rituals and our sacraments. Our ceremonies bring the worshipers to-
gether in a living drama and a unifying brotherhood. Our sacraments are
really what we call them — outward signs of an inward grace. It is a
comfort to parents to see their child, through baptism and confirmation,
accepted into the community and into the inheritance of the ancient
faith; so the generations are united into a timeless family, and the
individual need not feel alone. It is a boon to the sinner to confess
his sins and receive absolu- tion; you say that this merely permits him
to sin again; we say that it en- courages him to begin a better life,
unburdened with the weight of guilt. Are not your psychiatrists
struggling to find a substitute for the confes- sional? And do they
create as many neurotics as they cure? Is it not beau- tiful that in the
sacrament of the Eucharist weak man is strengthened and</p>
<p>EPILOGUE IN ELYSIUM</p>
<p>797</p>
<p>inspired by union with God? Have you ever seen anything lovelier than
children going to their First Communion?</p>
<p>Voltaire. I’m still shocked by the idea of eating God. It’s a
remnant</p>
<p>of savage customs.</p>
<p>Benedict. Again you confuse the outward sign with the inward grace.
There is nothing so shallow as sophistication; it judges everything from
the surface, and thinks it is profound. All modern life has been misled
by it. In religion the mature mind has passed through three stages:
belief, unbelief, and understanding.</p>
<p>Voltaire. You may be right. But that does not justify the hypocrisy
of your sinful prelates, or the persecution of honest thought.</p>
<p>Benedict. Yes, we have been guilty. The faith is good, but its
minis-</p>
<p>rants are men and women, fallible and sinful.</p>
<p>Voltaire. But if its ministrants are fallible, why do they claim
infalli-</p>
<p>bility?</p>
<p>Benedict. The Church claims infallibility only for her most
official,</p>
<p>fundamental, and considered judgments. Somewhere debate has to stop
if the mind or the society is to have peace.</p>
<p>Voltaire. And so we come back to the stifling consorship and
brutal</p>
<p>intolerance that were the bane of my life and the disgrace of
ecclesiastical history. I can see the doors of the Inquisition opening
again.</p>
<p>Benedict. I hope not. It was because the papacy was weak that the In-
quisition was so cruel; my predecessors strove to check it.</p>
<p>Voltaire. The popes too were guilty. They looked with equanimity</p>
<p>upon the killing of hundreds of Jews during the Crusades, and they
con- spired with the French state to slaughter the Albigenses. Why
should we go back to a faith that, with all its charm, could engender,
and can still condone, such savagery?</p>
<p>Benedict. We shared in the manners of our time. We share now in the
improvement of morals. See our priests; are they not a fine group of men
in education, devotion, and conduct?</p>
<p>Voltaire. So I am told, but perhaps that is because they have
competi- tion. Who knows what they will be when the higher birth rate of
their adherents gives them political supremacy? The Christians of the
first three centuries of our era were noted for their superior morals,
but you know what they became when they rose to power. They killed a
hundred times more people for religious dissent than all the Roman
emperors had ever done.</p>
<p>Benedict. Our people were then only emerging into education. Let us
hope that we shall do better next time.</p>
<p>Voltaire. The Church did do better at times. During the Italian
Renais- sance some of your predecessors showed an urbane tolerance of
unbelief</p>
<p>798</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>when unbelievers made no attempt to deprive the poor of their
consolatory faith. I, for one, do not wish to destroy the faith of the
poor. And I assure you that the poor do not read my books.</p>
<p>Benedict. Blessed be the poor.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Meanwhile you must forgive me if I and my like continue</p>
<p>our efforts to enlighten a minority sufficiently numerous and
resolute to prevent any recurrence of ecclesiastical domination over the
thought of educated men. History would be worthless to us if it did not
teach us to keep on our guard against the natural intolerance of an
orthodoxy wielding power. I honor and reverence you, Benedict, but I
must remain Voltaire.</p>
<p>Benedict. May God forgive you.</p>
<p>Voltaire. Pardon is the word for all.</p>
