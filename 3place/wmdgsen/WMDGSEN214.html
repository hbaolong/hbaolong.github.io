<p>XXXThe Triumph of Christianity</p>
<p>A.D. 306-325</p>
<p>I. THE WAR OF CHURCH AND STATE</p>
<p>A.D. 64-3 I I</p>
<p>I N pre-Christian days the Roman government had for the most part
allowed to the rivals of orthodox paganism a tolerance which they in
turn had shown to the official and imperial cults; nothing was demanded
from the adherents of new faiths except an occasional gesture of
adoration to the gods and head of the state. The emperors were piqued to
find that of all the heretics under their rule only the Christians and
the Jews refused to join in honoring their genius. The burning of
incense before a statue of the emperor had become a sign and affirmation
of loyalty to the Empire, like the oath of allegiance required for
citizenship today. On its side the Church resented the Roman idea that
religion was subordinate to the state; it saw in emperor-worship an act
of polytheism and idolatry, and instructed its followers to refuse it at
any cost. The Roman government concluded that Christianity was a radical
— perhaps a communist — movement, subtly designed to overthrow the
established order.</p>
<p>Before Nero the two forces had found it possible to live together
without blows. The law had exempted the Jews from emperor-worship, and
the Christians, at first confused with the Jews, were granted the same
privilege. But the execution of Peter and Paul, and the burning of
Christians to light up Nero’s games, turned this mutual and contemptuous
tolerance into un - ceasing hostility and intermittent war. We cannot
wonder that after such provocation the Christians turned their full
armory against Rome — de- nounced its immorality and idolatry, ridiculed
its gods, rejoiced in its calami- ties , 1 and predicted its early fall.
In the ardor of a faith made intolerant by intolerance, Christians
declared that all who had had a chance to accept Christ and had refused
would be condemned to eternal torments; many of them foretold the same
fate for all the pre-Christian or non-Christian world; some excepted
Socrates. In reply, pagans called the Christians “dregs</p>
<p>646</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 647</p>
<p>of the people” and “insolent barbarians,” accused them of “hatred of
the human race,” and ascribed the misfortunes of the Empire to the anger
of pagan deities whose Christian revilers had been allowed to live . 2 A
thousand slanderous legends arose on either side. Christians were
charged with de- monic magic, secret immorality, drinking human blood at
the Paschal feast , 3 and worshiping an ass.</p>
<p>But the conflict was profounder than mere pugnacity. Pagan
civilization was founded upon the state, Christian civilization upon
religion. To a Roman his religion was part of the structure and ceremony
of government, and his morality culminated in patriotism; to a Christian
his religion was something apart from and superior to political society;
his highest allegiance belonged not to Caesar but to Christ. Tertullian
laid down the revolutionary principle that no man need obey a law that
he deemed unjust . 4 The Christian revered his bishop, even his priest,
far above the Roman magistrate; he submitted his legal troubles with
fellow Christians to his church authorities rather than to the officials
of the state . 5 The detachment of the Christian from earthly affairs
seemed to the pagan a flight from civic duty, a weakening of the
national fiber and will. Tertullian advised Christians to refuse
military serv- ice; and that a substantial number of them followed his
counsel is indicated by Celsus’ appeal to end this refusal, and Origen’s
reply that though Chris - tians will not fight for the Empire they will
pray for it . 6 Christians were exhorted by their leaders to avoid
non-Christians, to shun their festival games as barbarous, and their
theaters as stews of obscenity . 7 Marriage with a non- Christian was
forbidden. Christian slaves were accused of introducing dis- cord into
the family by converting their masters’ children or wives; Chris -
tianity was charged with breaking up the home . 8</p>
<p>The opposition to the new religion came rather from the people than
from the state. The magistrates were often men of culture and tolerance;
but the mass of the pagan population resented the aloofness,
superiority, and certainty of the Christians, and called upon the
authorities to punish these “atheists” for insulting the gods.
Tertullian notes “the general hatred felt for us.” 0 From the time of
Nero Roman law seems to have branded the</p>
<p>648 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXbegun, and restored t he exiles.” 13 Pliny enforced the law with
the ofHcious - ness of an amateur ( 1 1 1 ), if we may judge from his
letter to Trajan:</p>
<p>The method I have observed toward those who have been de-</p>
<p>nounced to me as Christians is this: I interrogated them whether they
were Christians; if they confessed it I repeated the question twice</p>
<p>again, adding the threat of capital punishment; if they still
persevered,</p>
<p>I ordered them to be executed. . . . The temples, which had been</p>
<p>almost deserted, begin now to be frequented . . . and there is a gen-
eral demand for sacrificial animals, which for some time past have met
with but few purchasers.</p>
<p>To which Trajan replied:</p>
<p>The method you have pursued, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases</p>
<p>of those denounced to you as Christians is eminently proper. . . . No
search should be made for these people ; when they are denounced and
found guilty they must be punished; but where the accused party</p>
<p>denies that he is a Christian, and gives proof … by adoring our</p>
<p>gods, he shall be pardoned. . . . Information without the
accuser’s</p>
<p>name subscribed must not be admitted in evidence against anyone .
14</p>
<p>The passage here italicized suggests that Trajan only reluctantly
carried out a pre-existing statute. Nevertheless, we hear of two
prominent martyrs in his principate: Simeon, head of the church of
Jerusalem, and Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch; presumably there were others
of less fame.</p>
<p>Hadrian, a skeptic open to all ideas, instructed his appointees to
give the Christians the benefit of every doubt. 15 Being more religious,
Antoninus allowed more persecution. At Smyrna the populace demanded of
the “Asiarch” Philip that he enforce the law; he complied by having
eleven Christians executed in the amphitheater (155). The bloodthirst of
the crowd was aroused rather than assuaged; it clamored for the death of
Bishop Poly- carp, a saintly patriarch of eighty-six years, who was said
in his youth to have known Saint John. Roman soldiers found the old man
in a suburban retreat, and brought him unresisting before the Asiarch at
the games. Philip pressed him: “Take the oath, revile Christ, and I will
let you go.” Polycarp, says the most ancient of the Acts of the Martyrs,
replied: “For eighty -six years have I been his servant, and he has done
me no wrong; how then can I blaspheme my King who saved me?” The crowd
cried out that he should be burned alive. The flames, says the pious
document, refused to bum him, “but he was within them as bread that is
being baked; and we perceived such a fragrant smell as might come from
incense or other costly spices. At length the lawless men commanded an
executioner to stab him. When he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 649</p>
<p>did this ther£ came out a dove, and so much blood that the fire was
quenched, and all the crowd marveled.” 16</p>
<p>The persecutions were renewed under the saintly Aurelius. When
famine, flood, pestilence, and war overwhelmed a once happy reign, the
conviction spread that these evils were due to neglect and denial of the
Roman gods. Aurelius shared the public terror, or yielded to it. In 177
he issued a rescript ordering the punishment of sects that caused
disturbances by “exciting the ill- balanced minds of men” with new winds
of doctrine. In that same year, at Vienne and Lyons, the pagan populace
arose in fury against the Christians, and stoned them whenever they
dared to stir from their homes. The im- perial legate ordered the arrest
of the leading Christians of Lyons. Bishop Pothinus, ninety years old,
died in jail from the effects of torture. A mes- senger was sent to Rome
to ask the advice of the Emperor as to the treatment of the remaining
prisoners. Marcus replied that those who denied Chris- tianity should be
freed, but those who professed it should be put to death according to
the law.</p>
<p>The annual festival of the Augustalia was now to be celebrated in
Lyons, and delegates from all Gaul crowded the provincial capital. At
the height of the games the accused Christians were brought to the
amphitheater and were questioned. Those who recanted were dismissed;
forty-seven who persisted were put to death with a variety and barbarity
of tortures equaled only by the Inquisition. Attalus, second to Pothinus
in the Christian com- munity, was forced to sit on a chair of red-hot
iron and roast to death. 17 Blandina, a slave girl, was tortured all
day, then bound up in a bag, and thrown into the arena to be gored to
death by a bull. Her silent fortitude led many Christians to believe
that Christ made his martyrs insensitive to pain; the same result might
have come from ecstasy and fear. “The Chris - tian,” said Tertullian,
“even when condemned to die, gives thanks.” 18 *</p>
<p>Under Commodus the persecutions waned. Septimius Severus renewed
them, even to the point of making baptism a crime. In 203 many
Christians suffered martyrdom in Carthage. One of them, a young mother
named Perpetua, left a touching account of her days in prison, and her
father’s prostrate pleas that she should renounce Christianity. She and
another young mother were tossed and gored by a bull; we have an
indication of the anesthetic effect of fear and trance in her later
query, “When are we to be tossed?” Story tells how she guided to her
throat the dagger of the reluctant gladiator who had to kill her. 10 The
Syrian empresses who followed Sep- timius had little concern for the
Roman gods, and gave Christianity a careless</p>

</ul>
<p>650 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXtoleration. Under Alexander Severus peace seemed established among
all the rival faiths.</p>
<p>The renewal of the barbarian attacks ended this truce. To understand
the persecution under Decius (or Aurelius) we must imagine a nation in
the full excitement of war, frightened by serious defeats, and expecting
hostile invasion. In 249 a wave of religious emotion swept the Empire;
men and women flocked to the temples and besieged the gods with prayers.
Amid this fever of patriotism and fear the Christians stood apart, still
resenting and discouraging military service, 20 scorning the gods, and
interpreting the collapse of the Empire as the prophesied prelude to the
destruction of “Babylon” and the return of Christ. Using the mood of the
people as an opportunity to strengthen national enthusiasm and unity,
Decius issued an edict requiring every inhabitant of the realm to offer
a propitiatory act of homage to the gods of Rome. Apparently Christians
were not asked to abjure their own faith, but were commanded to join in
the universal mpplicatio to the deities who, the populace believed, had
so often saved imperiled Rome. Most Christians complied; in Alexandria,
according to its Bishop Dionysius, “the apostasy was universal”; 21 it
was likewise in Carthage and Smyrna; probably these Christians
considered the mpplicatio a patriotic formality. But the bishops of
Jerusalem and Antioch died in jaij, and the bishops of Rome and Toulouse
were put to death (250). Hundreds of Roman Christians were crowded into
dungeons; some were beheaded, some were burned at the stake, a few were
given to the beasts in holiday festival. After a year the persecution
abated; and by Easter of 251 it was practically at an end.</p>
<p>Six years later Valerian, in another crisis of invasion and terror,
ordered that “all persons must conform to the Roman ceremonials,” and
forbade any Christian assemblage. Pope Sixtus II resisted, and was put
to death with four of his deacons. Bishop Cyprian of Carthage was
beheaded, the bishop of Tarragona was burned alive. In 261, after the
Persians had removed Valerian from the scene, Gallicnus published the
first edict of toleration, recognizing Christianity as a permitted
religion, and ordering that property taken from Christians should be
restored to them. Minor persecutions occurred in the next forty years,
but for the most part these were for Christianity decades of
unprecedented calm and rapid growth. In the chaos and terror of the
third century men fled from the weakened state to the consolations of
religion, and found them more abundantly in Christianity than in its
rivals. The Church made rich converts now, built costly cathedrals, and
allowed its adherents to share in the joys of this world. The odium
tbeologicum sub- sided among the people; Christians intermingled more
freely with pagans,</p>
<p>CHAP.XXX) THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 651</p>
<p>even married them. The Oriental monarchy of Diocletian seemed
destined to consolidate religious as well as political security and
peace.</p>
<p>Galerius, however, saw in Christianity the last obstacle to absolute
rule, and urged his chief to complete the Roman restoration by restoring
the Roman gods. Diocletian hesitated; he was averse to needless risks,
and esti- mated more truly than Galerius the magnitude of the task. But
one day, at an imperial sacrifice, the Christians made the sign of the
cross to ward off evil demons. When the augurs failed to find on the
livers of the sacrificed animals the marks that they had hoped to
interpret, they blamed the presence of profane and unbelieving persons.
Diocletian ordered that all in attendance should offer sacrifice to the
gods or be flogged, and that all soldiers in the army should similarly
conform or be dismissed (302). Strange to say, Christian writers agreed
with the pagan priests: the prayers of the Chris- tian, said Lactantius,
22 kept the Roman gods at a distance; and Bishop Dio- nysius had written
to the same effect a generation before. Galerius at every opportunity
argued the need of religious unity as a support to the new monarchy; and
at last Diocletian yielded. In February, 303, the four rulers decreed
the destruction of all Christian churches, the burning of Christian
books, the dissolution of Christian congregations, the confiscation of
their property, the exclusion of Christians from public office, and the
punishment of death for Christians detected in religious assembly. A
band of soldiers inaugurated the persecution by burning to the ground
the cathedral at Nico- media.</p>
<p>The Christians were now numerous enough to retaliate. A revolutionary
movement broke out in Syria, and in Nicomedia incendiaries twice set
fire to Diocletian’s palace. Galerius accused the Christians of the
arson; they</p>
<p>Maximian carried out the edict with military thoroughness in
Italy.</p>
<p>Galerius, become Augustus, gave every encouragement to the
persecution in the East. The roll of martyrs was increased in every part
of the Empire except Gaul and Britain, where Constantius contented
himself with burning a few churches. Eusebius assures us, presumably
with the hyperbole of indignation, that men were flogged till the flesh
hung from their bones, or their flesh was scraped to the bone with
shells; salt or vinegar was poured</p>
<p>6j 2 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXupon the wounds; the flesh was cut off bit by bit and fed to
waiting animals; or bound to crosses, men were eaten piecemeal by
starved beasts. Some victims had their fingers pierced with sharp reeds
under the nails; some had their eyes gouged out; some were suspended by
a hand or a foot; some had molten lead poured down their throats; some
were beheaded, or crucified, or beaten to death with clubs; some were
tom apart by being tied to the momentarily bent branches of trees. 28 We
have no pagan narrative of these events.</p>
<p>The persecution continued for eight years, and brought death to ap-
proximately 1 500 Christians, orthodox or heretic, and diverse
sufferings to countless more. Thousands of Christians recanted;
tradition said that even Marcellinus, Bishop of Rome, denied his faith
under duress of terror and pain. But most of the persecuted stood firm;
and the sight or report of heroic fidelity under torture strengthened
the faith of the wavering and won new members for the hunted
congregations. As the brutalities multi- plied, the sympathy of the
pagan population was stirred; the opinion of good citizens found courage
to express itself against the most ferocious oppres- sion in Roman
history. Once the people had urged the state to destroy Christianity;
now the people stood aloof from the government, and many pagans risked
death to hide or protect Christians until the storm should pass. 24 In 3
1 1 Galerius, suffering from a mortal illness, convinced of failure, and
implored by his wife to make his peace with the undefeated God of the
Christians, promulgated an edict of toleration, recognizing Christianity
as a lawful religion and asking the prayers of the Christians in return
for “our most gentle clemency.”</p>
<p>The Diocletian persecution was the greatest test and triumph of the
Church. It weakened Christianity for a time through the natural
defection of adherents who had joined it, or grown up, during a half
century of unmolested prosperity. But soon the defaulters were doing
penance and pleading for readmission to the fold. Accounts of the
loyalty of martyrs who had died, or of “confessors” who had suffered,
for the faith were circulated from community to community; and these
Acta Marty rum, intense with exaggeration and fascinating with legend,
played a historic role in awaken- ing or confirming Christian belief.
“The blood of martyrs,” said Tertullian, “is seed.” 20 There is no
greater drama in human record than the sight of a few Christians,
scorned or oppressed by a succession of emperors, bearing all trials
with a fierce tenacity, multiplying quietly, building order while their
enemies generated chaos, fighting the sword with the word, brutality
with hope, and at last defeating the strongest state that history has
known. Caesar and Christ had met in the arena, and Christ had won.</p>

<li>THE RISE OF CONSTANTINE</li>
</ol>
<p>Diocletian, peaceful in his Dalmatian palace, saw the failure of both
the persecution and the tetrarchy. Seldom had the Empire witnessed such
con- fusion as followed his abdication. Galerius prevailed upon
Constantius to let him appoint Severus and Maximinus Daza as “Caesars”
(305). At once the principle of heredity asserted its claims: Maxentius,
son of Maximian, wished to succeed his father’s a uthority, and a like
resolution fired Con- stantine.</p>
<p>Flavius Valerius Constantinus had begun life at Naissus in Moesia
(272?) as the illegitimate son of Constantius by his legal concubine
Helena, a bar- maid from Bithynia. 27 On becoming a “Caesar,” C
onstantius was required by Diocletian to put away Helena and to take
Maximian’s stepdaughter Theodora as his wife. Constantine received only
a meager education. He took up soldiering early, and proved his valor in
the wars against Egypt and Persia. Galerius, on succeeding Diocletian,
kept the young officer near him as a hostage for the good behavior of
Constantius. When the latter asked Galerius to send the youth to him
Galerius procrastinated craftily; but Constantine escaped from his
watchers, and rode night and day across Europe to join his father at
Boulogne and share in a British campaign. The Gallic army, deeply loyal
to the humane Constantius, came to love his handsome, brave, and
energetic son; and when the father died at York (306), the t roops
acclaimed Constantine not merely as “Caesar” but as Augustus — emperor.
He accepted the lesser title, excusing himself on the ground that his
life would be unsafe without an army at his back. Galerius, too distant
to intervene, reluctantly recogniz ed him as a “Caesar.” Con - stantine
fought successfully against the invading Franks, and fed the beasts of
the Gallic amphitheaters with barbarian kings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Rome the Praetorian Guard, eager to restore the ancient
capital to leadership, hailed Maxentius as emperor (306). Severus
descended from Milan to attack him; Maximian, to confound the confusion,
returned to the purple at his son’s request, and joined in the campaign;
Severus was deserted by his troops and put to death (307). To help
himself face the growing chaos, the aging Galerius appointed a new
Augustus — Flavius Li- cinius; hearing which, Constantine assumed a like
dignity (307). A year later Maximinus Daza adopted the same title, so
that in place of the two Augusti of Diocleti an’s plan there were now
six; no one cared to be merely “Caesar.” Maxentius quarreled with his
father; Maximian went to Gaul to seek Constantine’s aid; while the
latter fought Germans on the Rhine, Maximian tried to replace him as
commander of the Gallic armies; Con-</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>654</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXstantine marched across Gaul, besieged the usurper in Marseilles,
captured him, and granted him the courtesy of suicide (310).</p>
<p>The death of Galerius ( 3 1 1 ) removed the last barrier between
intrigue and war. Maximinus plotted with Maxentius to overthrow Licinius
and Constantine, who conspired to overthrow them. Talcing the
initiative, Con- stantine crossed the Alps, defeated an army near Turin,
and advanced upon Rome with a celerity of movement, and a restraining
discipline of his troops, that recalled the march of Caesar from the
Rubicon. On October 27, 312, he met the forces of Maxentius at Saxa
Rubra (Red Rocks) nine miles north of Rome; and by superior strategy
compelled Maxentius to fight with his back to the Tiber, and no retreat
possible except over the Mulvian Bridge. On the afternoon before the
battle, says Eusebius, 2S Constantine saw a flaming cross in the sky,
with the Greek words en toutoi mka —“m this sign con - quer.” * Early
the next morning, according to Eusebius and Lactantius, 31 Constantine
dreamed that a voice commanded him to have his soldiers mark upon their
shields the letter X with a line drawn through it and curled around the
top — the symbol of Christ. On arising he obeyed, and then advanced into
the forefront of battle behind a standard (known henceforth as the
labarum ) carrying the initials of Christ interwoven with a cross. As
Max- entius displayed the Mithraic-Aurelian banner of the Unconquerable
Sun, Constantine cast in his lot with the Christians, who were numerous
in his army, and made the engagement a turning point in the history of
religion. To the worshipers of Mithras in Constantine’s forces the cross
could give no offense, for they had long fought under a standard bearing
a Mithraic cross of light. 32 In any case Constantine won the battle of
the Mulvian Bridge, and Alaxentius perished in the Tiber with thousands
of his troops. The victor entered Rome the welcomed and undisputed
master of the West.</p>
<p>Early in 3 1 3 Constantine and Licinius met at Alilan to co-ordinate
their rule. To consolidate Christian support in all provinces,
Constantine and Licinius issued an “Edict of Milan,” confirming the
religious toleration proclaimed by Galerius, extending it to all
religions, and ordering the restora- tion of Christian properties seized
during the recent persecutions. After this historic declaration, which
in effect conceded the defeat of paganism, Constantine returned to the
defense of Gaul, and Licinius moved eastward to overwhelm Maximinus (3
13). The death of Maximinus shortly afterward left Constantine and
Licinius the unchallenged rulers of the Empire. Licinius</p>

<p>married Constantine’s sister, and a war - weary people rejoiced at
the prospect of peace.</p>
<p>But neither of the Augusti had quite abandoned the hope of undivided
supremacy. In 3 14 their mounting enmity reached the point of war. Con-
stantine invaded Pannonia, defeated Licinius, and exacted the surrender
of all Roman Europe except Thrace. Licinius revenged himself upon Con-
stantine’ s Christian supporters by renewing the persecution in Asia and
Egypt. He excluded Christians from his palace at Nicomedia, required
every soldier to adore the pagan gods, forbade the simultaneous
attendance of both sexes at Christian worship, and at last prohibited
all Christian services within city walls. Disobedient Christians lost
their positions, their citizen- ship, their property, their liberty, or
their lives.</p>
<p>Constantine watched for an opportunity not only to succor the
Christians of the East, but to add the East to his realm. When
barbarians invaded Thrace, and Licinius failed to move against them,
Constantine led his army from Thessalonica to the rescue of Licinius’
province. After the barbarians were driven back Licinius protested Const
antine’s entry into Thrace; and as neither ruler desired peace, war was
renewed. The defender of Chris- tianity, with 130,000 men, met the
defender of paganism, with 160,000 men, first at Adrianople and then at
Chrysopolis (Scutari), won, and became sole emperor (323). Licinius
surrendered on a promise of pardon; but in the following year he was
executed on the charge that he had resumed his intrigues. Constantine
recalled the Christian exiles, and restored to all “con - fessors” their
lost privileges and property. While still proclaiming liberty of worship
for all, he now definitely declared himself a Christian, and invited his
subjects to join him in embracing the new faith.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>CONSTANTINE AND CHRISTIANITY</li>
</ol>
<p>Was his conversion sincere — was it an act of religious belief, or a
con- summate stroke of political wisdom? Probably the latter. :,:l His
mother Helena had turned to Christianity when Constantins divorced her;
presum- ably she had acquainted her son with the excellences of the
Christian way; and doubtless he had been impressed by the invariable
victory that had crowned his arms under the banner and cross of Christ.
But only a skeptic would have made so subtle a use of the religious
feelings of humanity. The Historia Augusta quotes hi m as saying, “it is
Fortuna that makes a man emperor” 34 — though this was a bow to modesty
rather than to chance. In his Gallic court he had surrounded himself
with pagan scholars and philos- ophers. 85 After his conversion he
seldom conformed to the ceremonial re-</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXquirements of Christian worship. His letters to Christian bishops
make it clear that he cared little for the theological differences that
agitated Chris- tendom — though he was willing to suppress dissent in
the interests of im- perial unity. Throughout his reign he treated the
bishops as his political aides; he summoned them, presided over their
councils, and agreed to enforce whatever opinion their majority should
formulate. A real believer would have been a Christian first and a
statesman afterward; with Constantine it was the reverse. Christianity
was to him a means, not an end.</p>
<p>He had seen in his lifetime the failure of three persecutions; and it
was not lost upon him that Christianity had grown despite them. Its
adherents were still very much in the minority; but they were relatively
united, brave, and strong, while the pagan majority was divided among
many creeds, and included a dead weight of simple souls without
conviction or influence. Christians were especially numerous in Rome
under Maxentius, and in the East under Licinius; Constantine’s support
of Christianity was worth a dozen legions to him in his wars against
these men. He was impressed by the com- parative order and morality of
Christian conduct, the bloodless beauty of Christian ritual, the
obedience of Christians to their clergy, their humble acceptance of
life’s inequalities in the hope of happiness beyond the grave; perhaps
this new religion would purify Roman morals, regenerate marriage and the
family, and allay the fever of class war. The Christians, despite bitter
oppression, had rarely revolted against the state; their teachers had
incul- cated submission to the civil powers, and had taught the divine
right of kings. Constantine aspired to an absolute monarchy; such a
government would profit from religious support; the hierarchical
discipline and ecu- menical authority of the Church seemed to offer a
spiritual correlate for monarchy. Perhaps that marvelous organization of
bishops and priests could become an instrument of pacification,
unification, and rule?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a world still preponderantly pagan, Constantine had
to feel his way by cautious steps. He continued to use vague
monotheistic lan- guage that any pagan could accept. During the earlier
years of his supremacy he carried out patiently the ceremonial required
of him as pontifex maximus of the traditional cult; he restored pagan
temples, and ordered the taking of the auspices. He used pagan as well
as Christian rites in dedicating Con- stantinople. He used pagan magic
formulas to protect crops and heal disease. 36</p>
<p>Gradually, as his power grew more secure, he favored Christianity
more openly. After 317 his coins dropped one by one their pagan
effigies, until by 323 they bore only neutral inscriptions. A legal text
of his reign, ques- tioned but not disproved, gave Christian bishops the
authority of judges in their dioceses; 37 other laws exempted Church
realty from taxation, 38 made</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) the TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY ^57</p>
<p>Christian associations juridical persons, allowed them to own land
and re- ceive bequests, and assigned the property of intestate martyrs
to the Church. 30 Constantine gave money to needy congregations, built
several churches in Constantinople and elsewhere, and forbade the
worship of images in the new capital. Forgetting the Edict of Milan, he
prohibited the meet- ings of heretical sects, and finally ordered the
destruction of their con- venticles. 40 He gave his sons an orthodox
Christian education, and financed his mother’s Christian philanthropies.
The Church rejoiced in blessings be - yond any expectation. Eusebius
broke out into orations that were songs of’ gratitude and praise; and
all over the Empire Christians gathered in festal thanksgiving for the
triumph of their God.</p>
<p>Three clouds softened the brilliance of this “cloudless day”: the
monastic secession, the Donatist schism, the Arian heresy. In the
interval between the Decian and the Diocletian persecution the Church
had become the richest religious organization in the Empire, and had
moderated its attacks upon wealth. Cyprian complained that his
parishioners were mad about money, that Christian women painted their
faces, that bishops held lucrative offices of state, made fortunes, lent
money at usurious interest, and denied their faith at the first sign of
danger. 41 Eusebius mourned that priests quar- reled violently in their
competition for ecclesiastical preferment. 42 While Christianity
converted the world, the world converted Christianity, and displayed the
natural paganism of mankind. Christian monasticism arose as a protest
against this mutual adjustment of the spirit and the flesh. A minority
wished to avoid any indulgence of human appetite, and to continue the
early Christian absorption in thoughts of eternal life. Following the
custom of the Cynics, some of these ascetics renounced all possessions,
donned the ragged robe of the philosopher, and subsisted on alms. A few,
like Paul the Hermit, went to live as solitaries in the Egyptian desert.
About 275 an Egyptian monk, Anthony, began a quarter century of isolated
existence first in a tomb, then in an abandoned mountain castle, then in
a rock-hewn desert cell. There he struggled nightly with frightful
visions and pleasant dreams, and overcame them all; until at last his
reputation for sanctity filled all Christendom, and peopled the desert
with emulating eremites. In 325 Pachomius, feeling that solitude was
selfishness, gathered anchorites into an abbey at Tabenne in Egypt, and
founded that cenobitic, or community, monasticism which was to have its
most influential development in the West. The Church opposed the
monastic movement for a time, and then accepted it as a necessary
balance to its increasing preoccupation with government.</p>
<p>Within a year after Constantine’s conversion the Church was tom by a
schism that might have ruined it in the very hour of victory. Donatus,
Bishop of</p>
<p>658 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXCarthage, supported by a priest of like name and temper, insisted
that Christian bishops who had surrendered the Scriptures to the pagan
police during the per- secutions had forfeited their office and powers;
that baptisms or ordinations performed by such bishops were null and
void; and that the validity of sacra- ments depended in part upon the
spiritual state of the ministrant. When the Church refused to adopt this
stringent creed, the Donatists set up rival bishops wherever the
existing prelate failed to meet their tests. Constantine, who had
thought of Christianity as a unifying force, was dismayed by the chaos
and violence that ensued, and was presumably not unmoved by the
occasional alliance of Donatists with radical movements among the
African peasantry. He called a council of bishops at Arles (314),
confirmed its denunciation of the Donatists, ordered the schismatics to
return to the Church, and decreed that recalcitrant congregations should
lose their property and their civil rights (31 6). Five years later, in
a momentary reminiscence of the Milan edict, he withdrew these measures,
and gave the Donatists a scornful toleration. The schism continued till
the Saracens overwhelmed orthodox and heretic alike in the conquest of
Africa.</p>
<p>In those same years Alexandria saw the rise of the most challenging
heresy in the history of the Church. About 318 a priest from the
Egyptian town of Baucalis startled his bishop with strange opinions
about the nature of Christ. A learned Catholic historian describes him
generously:</p>
<p>Arius . . . was tall and thin, of melancholy look, and an aspect
that</p>
<p>showed traces of his austerities. He was known to be an ascetic,
as</p>
<p>could be seen from his costume — a short tunic without sleeves, under
a scarf that served as a cloak. His manner of speaking was gentle; his
addresses were persuasive. The consecrated virgins, who were nu-</p>
<p>merous in Alexandria, held him in great esteem; and he counted many
stanch supporters among the higher clergy. 43</p>
<p>Christ, said Arius, was not one with the Creator, he was rather the
Logos, the first and highest of all created beings. Bishop Alexander
protested, Arius persisted. If, he argued, the Son had been begotten of
the Father, it must have been in time; the Son therefore could not be
coetemal with the Father. Furthermore, if Christ was created, it must
have been from nothing, not from the Father’s substance; Christ was not
“consubstantiar with the Father. 44 The Holy Spirit was begotten by the
Logos, and was still less God than the Logos. We see in these doctrines
the continuity of ideas from Plato through the Stoics, Philo, Plotinus,
and Origen to Arius; Platonism, which had so deeply influenced Christian
theology, was now in conflict with the Church.</p>
<p>Bishop Alexander was shocked not only by these views but by their
rapid spread even among the clergy. He called a council of Egyptian
bishops at</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY &lt;&gt;59</p>
<p>Alexandria, persuaded it to unfrock Arius and his followers, and sent
an account of the proceedings to other bishops. Some of these objected;
many priests sympathized with Arius* throughout the Asiatic provinces
clergy as well as laity divided on the issue, and made the cities ring
with such “tumult and dis order . . . that the Christian religion,” says
Eusebius, “afforded a subject of profane merriment to the pagans, even
in their theaters.” 45 Con - stantine, coming to Nicomedia after
overthrowing Licinius, heard the story from its bishop. He sent both
Alexander and Arius a personal appeal to imi- tate the calm of
philosophers, to reconcile their differences peaceably, or at least to
keep their debates from the public ear. The letter, preserved by
Eusebius, clearly reveals Constantine’s lack of theology , and the
political purpose of his religious policy.</p>
<p>I had proposed to lead back to a single form the ideas which all</p>
<p>people conceive of the Deity; for I feel strongly that if I could
induce men to unite on that subject, the conduct of public affairs would
be considerably eased. But alas! I hear that there are more disputes
among you than recently in Africa. The cause seems to be quite trifling,
and unworthy of such fierce contests. You, Alexander, wished to know</p>
<p>what your priests were thinking on a point of law, even on a portion
only of a question in itself entirely devoid of importance; and you,</p>
<p>Arius, if you had such thoughts, should have kept silence. . . .
There</p>
<p>was no need to make these questions public . . . since they are prob-
lems tha t idleness alone raises, and whose only use is to sharpen men’s
wits. . . these are silly actions worthy of inexperienced children, and
not of priests or reasonable man. 40</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXThe Council met in the hall of an imperial palace. Constantine
presided and opened the proceedings by a brief appeal to the bishops to
restore the unity of the Church. He “listened patiently to the debates,”
reports Eusebius, “moderated the violence of the contending parties,” 48
and himself joined in the argument. Arius reaffirmed his view that
Christ was a created being, not equal to the Father, but “divine only by
participation.” Clever ques- tioners forced him to admit that if Christ
was a creature, and had had a beginning, he could change; and that if he
could change he might pass from virtue to vice. The answers were
logical, honest, and suicidal. Athanasius, the eloquent and pugnacious
archdeacon whom Alexander had brought with him as a theological sword,
made it clear that if Christ and the Holy Spirit were not of one
substance with the Father, polytheism would triumph. He conceded the
difficulty of picturing three distinct persons in one God, but argued
that reason must bow to the mystery of the Trinity. All but seven- teen
of the bishops agreed with him, and signed a statement expressing his
view. The supporters of Arius agreed to sign if they might add one iota,
changing bomoousion to bomoiousion. The Council refused, and issued with
the Emperor’s approval the following creed:</p>
<p>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things</p>
<p>visible or invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
be-</p>
<p>gotten . . . not made, being of one essence ( bomoousion ) with
the</p>
<p>Father . . . who for us men and our salvation came down and was</p>
<p>made flesh, was made man, suffered, rose again the third day,
ascended into heaven, and comes to judge the quick and the dead. . . .*
49</p>
<p>Only five bishops, finally only two, refused to sign this formula.
These two, with the unrepentant Arius, were anathematized by the Council
and exiled by the Emperor. An imperial edict ordered that all books by
Arius should be burned, and made the concealment of such a book
punishable with death.f Constantine celebrated the conclusion of the
Council with a royal dinner to all the assembled bishops, and then
dismissed them with the request that they should not tear one another to
pieces . 51 He was mistaken in thinking that the controversy was ended,
or that he himself would not change his view of it, but he was right in
believing that he had struck a great blow for the unity of the Church.

the Bishop of Rome. On the question of clerical celibacy the Council
inclined to require continence of married priests; but Paphnurius,
Bishop of Upper Thebes, persuaded his peers to leave unchanged the
prevailing custom, which forbade marriage after ordination, but

<p>siastical majority that the organization and survival of the Church
required a certain fixity of doctrine; and in final effect it achieved
that practical unanim- ity of basic belief which gave the medieval
Church its Catholic name. At the same time it marked the replacement of
paganism with Christianity as the religious expression and support of
the Roman Empire, and committed Con- stantine to a more definite
alliance with Christianity than ever before. A new civilization, based
on a new religion, would now rise over the ruins of an exhausted culture
and a dying creed. The Middle Ages had begun.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>CONSTANTINE AND CIVILIZATION</li>
</ol>
<p>A year after the Council Constantine dedicated, amid the desolation
of Byzantium, a new city which he termed Nova Roma, and which posterity
called by his name. In 330 he turned his back upon both Rome and Nico-
media, and made Constantinople his capital. There he surrounded himself
with the impressive pomp of an Oriental court, feeling that its
psychological influence upon army and people would make its expensive
pageantry a subtle economy in government. He protected the army with
able diplomacy and arms, tempered despotism with humane decrees, and
lent his aid to letters and the arts. He encouraged the schools at
Athens, and founded at Con- stantinople a new university where
state-paid professors taught Greek and Latin, literature and philosophy,
rhetoric and law, and trained officials for the Empire. 52 He confirmed
and extended the privileges of physicians and teachers in all provinces.
Provincial governors were instructed to establish schools of
architecture, and to draw students to them with divers privi- leges and
rewards. Artists were exempted from civic obligations, so that they
might have time to learn their art thoroughly and transmit it to their
sons. The art treasures of the Empire were drawn upon to make
Constantinople an elegant capital.</p>
<p>In Rome the architectural works of this period were inaugurated
by</p>
<p>Maxentius. He began (306), and Constantine finished, an immense
basilica that marked the climax of classical architecture in the West.
Adapting the structure of the great baths, this edifice covered an area
330 by 250 feet. Its central hall, 1 14 by 82 feet, was roofed by three
cross vaults of concrete 1 20 feet high, partly supported by eight broad
piers faced with fluted Co- rinthian columns sixty feet tall. Its
pavement was of colored marble; its bays were peopled with statuary; and
the walls of these bays were prolonged above their roofs to serve as
elevated buttresses for the central vaults. Gothic and Renaissance
architects found much instruction in these vaults and but- tresses.
Bramante, designing St. Peter’s, planned to “raise the Pantheon over</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>662</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXthe Basilica of Constantine” C 3 — i.e., to crown a spacious nave
with a massive dome.</p>
<p>The first Christian emperor built many churches in Rome, probably
including the original form of San Lorenzo outside the Walls. To
celebrate his victory at the Mulvian Bridge he raised in 3 1 5 the arch
that still towers over the Via dei Trionfi. It is one of the best
preserved of Rome’s remains; and its majesty is not visibly injured by
the diverse pilferage of its parts. Four finely proportioned shafts,
rising from sculptured bases, divide the three arches, and support an
ornate entablature. The attic story bears reliefs and statues taken from
monuments of Trajan and Aurelius; while the medallions between the
columns are from some building of Hadrian’s reign. Two of the reliefs
appear to be the work of Con - st antine’s artists. The crude squat
figures, the awkward quarrel of profile faces</p>
<p>Early in this fourth century a new art took form — the “illumination”
of manu - scripts with miniature paintings. Literature itself was now
predominantly Chris- tian. Lucius Firmianus Lactantius expounded
Christianity eloquently in Divinae Institutiones (307), and in De
Mortibiis Persccutormn (314) described the final agonies of the
persecuting emperors with Ciceronian elegance and venom. “Re - ligion,”
wrote Lactantius, “must by its very nature be untrammeled, unforced,
free” 55 — a heresy which he did not live to expiate. More famous was
Eusebius Pamphili, bishop of Caesarea. He began his literary career as a
priestly scribe and librarian for his episcopal predecessor, Pamphilus,
whom he loved so well that he adopted his name. Pamphilus had acquired
Origen’s library, and had built around it the largest Christian
collection of books yet known. Living among these volumes, Eusebius
became the most erudite cleric of his time. Pamphilus lost his life in
the Galerian persecution (310), and Eusebius was much plagued by later
queries as to how he himself had survived. He made diverse enemies by
taking a middle position between Arius and Alexander; nevertheless, he
became the Bossuet of C onstantine’s court, and was commissioned to
write the imperial biography. Part of his scholastic harvest was
gathered into a Universal History — the most complete of ancient
chronologies. Eusebius arranged sacred and profane history in parallel
columns divided by a synchronizing row of dates, and tried to fix the
time of every important event from Abraham to Constantine. All later
chronologies rested on this “canon.”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 663</p>
<p>Putting flesh upon these bones, Eusebius issued in 325 an
Ecclesiastical History describing the development of the Church from its
beginnings to the Council of Nicaea. Here in the first chapter, again
serving as a model for Bossuet, was the earliest philosophy of history —
portraying time as the battleground of God and Satan, and all events as
advancing the triumph of Christ. The book was poorly arranged but well
written. The sources were critically and conscientiously examined, the
statements are as accurate as in any ancient work of history; and at
every turn Eusebius put posterity in his debt by quoting important docu-
ments that would otherwise have been lost. The bishop’s learning is
enormous, his style is warmed with feeling and rises to eloquence in
moments of theological odium. He frankly excludes such matters as might
not edify his Christian readers or support his philosophy, and he
manages to write a history of the great Council without mentioning
either Arius or Athanasius. The same honest dishonesty makes his Life of
Constantine a panegyric rather than a biography. It begins with eight
inspiring chapters on the Emperor’s piety and good works, and tells how
he “governed his empire in a godly manner for more than thirty years.”
One would never guess from this book that Constantine had killed his
son, his nephew, and his wife.</p>
<p>For like Augustus, Constantine had managed well everything but his
family. His relations with his mother were generally happy. Apparently
by his commis- sion she went to Jerusalem, and leveled to the ground the
scandalous Temple of Aphrodite that had been built, it was said, over
the Saviour’s tomb. According to Eusebius the Holy Sepulcher thereupon
came to light, with the very cross on which Christ had died. Constantine
ordered a Church of the Holy Sepulcher to be built over the tomb, and
the revered relics were preserved in a special shrine. As in classical
days the pagan world had cherished and adored she relics of the Trojan
War, and even Rome had boasted the Palladium of Troy’s Athene, so now
the Christian world, changing its surface and renewing its essence in
the immemorial manner of human life, began to collect and worship relics
of Christ and the saints. Helena raised a chapel over the traditional
site of Jesus’ birth at Bethlehem, modestly served the nuns who
ministered there, and then returned to Constantinople to die in the arms
of her son.</p>
<p>Constantine had been twice married: first to Minervina, who had borne
him a son Crispus; then to Maximian’s daughter Fausta, by whom he had
three daughters and three sons. Crispus became an excellent soldier, and
rendered vital aid to his father in the campaigns against Licinius. In
326 Crispus was put to death by Constantine’s order; about the same time
the Emperor decreed the execution of Licinianus, son of Licinius by
Constan- tine’s sister Constantia; and shortly thereafter Fausta was
slain by her hus - band’s command. We do not know the reasons for this
triple execution. Zosimus assures us that Crispus had made love to
Fausta, who accused him to the Emperor; and that Helena, who loved
Crispus dearly, had avenged</p>
<p>6&lt;5 4 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXhim by persuading Constantine that his wife had yielded to his son
. 57 Possibly Fausta had schemed to remove Crispus from the path of her
sons’ rise to imperial power, and Licinianus may have been killed for
plotting to claim his father’s share of the realm.</p>
<p>Fausta achieved her aim after her death, for in 3 35 Constantine
bequeathed the Empire to his surviving sons and nephews. Two years
later, at Easter, he celebrated with festival ceremonies the thirtieth
year of his reign. Then, feeling the nearness of death, he went to take
the warm baths at near-by Aquyrion. As his illness increased, he called
for a priest to administer to him that sacrament of baptism which he had
purposely deferred to this moment, hoping to be cleansed by it from all
the sins of his crowded life. Then the tired ruler, aged sixty-four,
laid aside the purple robes of royalty, put on the white garb of a
Christian neophyte, and passed away.</p>
<p>He was a masterly general, a remarkable administrator, a superlative
states- man. He inherited and completed the restorative work of
Diocletian; through them the Empire lived 1150 years more. He continued
the monarchical forms of Aurelian and Diocletian, partly out of ambition
and vanity, partly, no doubt, because he believed that absolute rule was
demanded by the chaos of the times. His greatest error lay in dividing
the Empire among his sons; presumably he foresaw that they would fight
for sole supremacy as he had done, but surmised that they would fight
even more certainly if he chose another heir; this, too, is a price of
monarchy. His executions we cannot judge, not knowing their provocation;
burdened with the problems of rule, he may have allowed fear and
jealousy to dethrone his reason for a while; and there are signs that
remorse weighed heavily upon his declining years. His Christianity,
beginning as policy, appears to have graduated into sincere conviction.
He became the most persistent preacher in his realm, persecuted heretics
faithfully, and took God into partnership at every step. Wiser than
Diocletian, he gave new life to an aging Empire by associating it with a
young religion, a vigorous organization, a fresh morality. By his aid
Christianity became a state as well as a church, and the mold, for
fourteen centuries, of European life and thought. Perhaps, if we except
Augustus, the grateful Church was right in naming him the greatest of
the emperors.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>I. WHY ROME FELL</p>
<p>I AHE two greatest problems in history,” says a brilliant scholar of
our time, are “how to account for the rise of Rome, and how to account
for her fall.” 1 We may come nearer to understanding them if we remember
that the fall of Rome, like her rise, had not one cause but many, and
was not an event but a process spread over 300 years. Some nations have
not lasted as long as Rome fell.</p>
<p>A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has
destroyed itself within. The essential causes of Rome’s decline lay in
her people, her</p>
<p>You must know that the world has grown old, and does not remain</p>
<p>in its former vigor. It bears witness to its own decline. The
rainfall and the sun’s warmth are both diminishing; the metals are
nearly exhausted; the husbandman is failing in the fields. 2</p>
<p>Barbarian inroads, and centuries of mining the richer veins, had
doubtless lowered Rome’s supply of the precious metals. In central and
southern Italy deforestation, erosion, and the neglect of irrigation
canals by a diminishing peasantry and a disordered government had left
Italy poorer than before.</p>
<p>The cause, however, was no inherent exhaustion of the soil, no change
in climate, but the negligence and sterility of harassed and discouraged
men.</p>
<p>Biological factors were more fundamental. A serious decline of
popula- tion appears in the West after Hadrian. It has been questioned,
but the mass importation of barbarians into the Empire by Aurelius,
Valentinian, Au- relian, Probus, and Constantine leaves little room for
doubt. 3 Aurelius, to replenish his army, enrolled slaves, gladiators,
policemen, criminals; either the crisis was greater, or the free
population less, than before; and the slave population had certainly
fallen. So many farms had been abandoned, above all in Italy, that
Pertinax offered them gratis to anyone who would till them.</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>A law of Septimius Severus speaks of a penuria hovnnum — z shortage
of men. 4 In Greece the depopulation had been going on for centuries. In
Alex- andria, which had boasted of its numbers, Bishop Dionysius
calculated that the population had in his time (250) been halved. He
mourned to “see the human race diminishing and constantly wasting away
.” 5 Only the barbarians and the Orientals were increasing, outside the
Empire and within.</p>
<p>What had caused this fall in population? Above all, family
limitation. Practiced first by the educated classes, it had now seeped
down to a prole- tariat named for its fertility; 0 by a.d. ioo it had
reached the agricultural classes, as shown by the use of imperial
alimenttt to encourage rural par- entage; by the third century it had
overrun the western provinces, and was lowering man power in Gaul. 7
Though branded as a crime, infanticide flourished as poverty grew. 8
Sexual excesses may have reduced human fer- tility; the avoidance or
deferment of marriage had a like efFcct, and the making of eunuchs
increased as Oriental customs flowed into the West. Plantianus,
Praetorian Prefect, had one hundred boys emasculated, and then gave them
to his daughter as a wedding gift. 0</p>
<p>Second only to family limitation as a cause of lessened population
were the slaughters of pestilence, revolution, and war. Epidemics of
major pro- portions decimated the population under Aurelius, Gallicnus,
and Con- stantine. In the plague of 260-65 almost every family in the
Empire was attacked; in Rome, we are told, there were 5000 deaths every
day for many weeks. 10 The mosquitoes of the Campagna were winning their
war against the human invaders of the Pontine marshes, and malaria was
sapping the strength of rich and poor in Latium and Tuscany. The
holocausts of war and revolution, and perhaps the operation of
contraception, abortion, and infanticide, had a dysgenic as well as a
numerical effect: the ablest men mar- ried latest, bred least, and died
soonest. The dole weakened the poor, luxury weakened the rich; and a
long peace deprived all classes in the peninsula of the martial
qualities and arts. The Germans who were now peopling north Italy and
filling the army were physically and morally superior to the sur- viving
native stock; if time had allowed a leisurely assimilation they might
have absorbed the classic culture and reinvigorated the Italian blood.
But time was not so generous. Moreover, the population of Italy had long
since been mingled with Oriental strains physically inferior, though
perhaps men- tally superior, to the Roman type. The rapidly breeding
Germans could not understand the classic culture, did not accept it, did
not transmit it; the rapidly breeding Orientals were mostly of a mind to
destroy that culture; the Romans, possessing it, sacrificed it to the
comforts of sterility. Rome was conquered not by barbarian invasion from
without, but by barbarian multi- plication within.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>667</p>
<p>Moral decay contributed to the dissolution. The virile character that
had been formed by arduous simplicities and a supporting faith relaxed
in the sunshine of wealth and the freedom of unbelief; men had now, in
the middle and upper classes, the means to yield to temptation, and only
expediency to restrain them. Urban congestion multiplied contacts and
frustrated sur- veillance; immigration brought together a hundred
cultures whose differ- ences rubbed themselves out into indifference.
Moral and esthetic standards were lowered by the magnetism of the mass;
and sex ran riot in freedom while political liberty decayed.</p>
<p>The greatest of historians held that Christianity was the chief cause
of Rome’s fall . 11 For this religion, he and his followers 12 argued,
had destroyed</p>
<p>There is some truth in this hard indictment. Christianity
unwillingly</p>
<p>shared in the chaos of creeds that helped produce that medley of
mores which moderately contributed to Rome’s collapse. But the growth of
Chris - tianity was more an effect than a cau se of Rome’s decay. The
breakup of the old religion had begun long before Christ; there were
more vigorous attacks upon it in Ennius and Lucretius than in any pagan
author after them. Moral disintegration had begun with the Roman
conquest of Greece, and had culminated under Nero; thereafter Roman
morals improved, and the ethical influence of Christianity upon Roman
life was largely a wholesome one. It was because Rome was already dying
that Christianity grew so rapidly. Men lost faith in the state not
because Christianity held them aloof, but because the state defended
wealth against poverty, fought to capture slaves, taxed toil to support
luxury, and failed to protect its people from famine, pestilence,
invasion, and destitution; forgivably they turned from Caesar preaching
war to Christ preaching peace, from incredible brutality to
unprecedented charity, from a life without hope or dignity to a faith
that consoled their poverty and honored their humanity. Rome was not
destroyed</p>
<p>66 8</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>by Christianity, any more than by barbarian invasion; it was an empty
shell when Christianity rose to influence and invasion came.</p>
<p>The economic causes of Rome’s decline have already been stated as pre
- requisite to the understanding of Diocletian’s reforms; they need only
a re - minding summary here. The precarious dependence upon provincial
grains, the collapse of the slave supply and the latifundia; the
deterioration of trans- port and the perils of trade; the loss of
provincial markets to provincial competition; the inability of Italian
industry to export the equivalent of Italian imports, and the consequent
drain of precious metals to the East; the destructive war between rich
and poor; the rising cost of armies, doles, public works, an expanding
bureaucracy, and a parasitic court; the depreci- ation of the currency;
the discouragement of ability, and the absorption of investment capital,
by confiscatory taxation; the emigration of capital and labor, the
strait jacket of serfdom placed upon agriculture, and of caste forced
upon industry: all these conspired to sap the material bases of Italian
life, until at last the power of Rome was a political ghost surviving
its economic death.</p>
<p>The political causes of decay were rooted in one fact — that
increasing despotism destroyed the citizen’s civic sense and dried up
statesmanship at its source. Powerless to express his political will
except by violence, the Roman lost interest in government and became
absorbed in his business, his amusements, his legion, or his individual
salvation. Patriotism and the pagan religion had been bound together,
and now together decayed. 18 The Senate, losing ever more of its power
and prestige after Pertinax, relapsed into indo- lence, subservience, or
venality; and the last barrier fell that might have saved the state from
militarism and anarchy. Local governments, overrun by imperial
correctores and exactores, no longer attracted first-rate men. The
responsibility of municipal officials for the tax quotas of their areas,
the rising expense of their unpaid honors, the fees, liturgies,
benefactions, and games expected of them, the dangers incident to
invasion and class war, led to a flight from office corresponding to the
flight from taxes, factories, and farms. Men deliberately made
themselves ineligible by debasing their social category; some fled to
other towns, some became farmers, some monks. In 313 Constantine
extended to the Christian clergy that exemption from municipal office,
and from several taxes, which pagan priests had tradi- tionally enjoyed;
the Church was soon swamped with candidates for ordina- tion, and cities
complained of losses in revenue and senators; in the end Constantine was
compelled to rule that no man eligible for municipal po- sition should
be admitted to the priesthood. 14 The imperial police pursued fugitives
from political honors as it hunted evaders of taxes or conscription;</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>66 9</p>
<p>it brought them back to the cities and forced them to serve; 18
finally it decreed that a son must inherit the social status of his
father, and must accept election if eligible to it by .his rank. A
serfdom of office rounded out the prison of economic caste.</p>
<p>Gallienus, fearing a revolt of the Senate, excluded senators from the
army. As martial material no longer grew in Italy, this decree completed
the mili- tary decline of the peninsula. The rise of provincial and
mercenary armies, the overthrow of the Praetorian Guard by Septimius
Severus, the emergence of provincial generals, and their capture of the
imperial throne, destroyed the leadership, even the independence, of
Italy long before the fall of the Empire in the West. The armies of Rome
were no longer Roman armies; they were composed chiefly of provincials,
largely of barbarians; they fought not for their altars and their homes,
but for their wages, their dona- tives, and their loot. They attacked
and plundered the cities of the Empire with more relish than they showed
in facing the enemy; most of them were the sons of peasants who hated
the rich and the cities as exploiters of the poor and the countryside;
and as civil strife provided opportunity, they sacked such towns with a
thoroughness that left little for alien barbarism to destroy. 10 When
military problems became more important than internal affairs, cities
near the frontiers were made the seats of government; Rome became a
theater for triumphs, a show place of imperial architecture, a museum of
political antiquities and forms. The multiplication of capitals and the
division of power broke down the unity of administration. The Empire,
grown too vast for its statesmen to rule or its armies to defend, began
to disintegrate. Left to protect themselves unaided against the Germans
and the Scots, Gaul and Britain chose their own imperatores, and made
them sovereign; Palmyra seceded under Zenobia, and soon Spain and Africa
would yield almost unresisting to barbarian conquest. In the reign of
Gallienus thirty generals governed thirty regions of the Empire in
practical inde- pendence of the central power. In this awful drama of a
great state breaking into pieces, the internal causes were the unseen
protagonists; the invading barbarians merely entered where weakness had
opened the door, and where the failure of biological, moral, economic,
and political statesmanship had left the stage to chaos, despondency,
and decay.</p>
<p>Externally the fall of the Western Roman Empire was hastened by the
expan- sion and migration of the Hsiung-nu, or Huns, in northwestern
Asia. Defeated in their eastward advance by Chinese armies and the
Chinese Wall, they turned westward, and about a.d. 355 reached the Volga
and the Oxus. Their pressure forced the Sarmatians of Russia to move
into the Balkans; the Goths, so harassed, moved again upon the Roman
frontiers. They were admitted across the Danube</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>670</p>
<p>to settle in Moesia (376); maltreated there by Roman officials, they
revolted, defeated a large Roman army at Adrianople (378), and for a
time threatened Constantinople. In 400 Alaric led the Visigoths over the
Alps into Italy, and in 410 they took and sacked Rome. In 429 Gaiseric
led the Vandals to the conquest of Spain and Africa, and in 455 they
took and sacked Rome. In 451 Attila led the Huns in an attack upon Gaul
and Italy; he was defeated at Chalons, but overran Lombardy. In 472 a
Pannonian general, Orestes, made his son emperor under the name of
Romulus Augustulus. Four years later the barbarian mercenaries who d
ominated the Roman army deposed this “little Augustus,” and named their
leader Odoacer king of Italy. Odoacer recognized the supremacy of the
Roman emperor at Constantinople, and was accepted by him as a vassal
king. The Roman Empire in the East would go on until 1453; in the West
it had come to an end.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE ROMAN ACHIEVEMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easier to explain Rome’s fall than to account for her long
survival. This is the essential accomplishment of Rome — that having won
the Medi- terranean world she adopted its culture, gave it ordtfr,
prosperity, and peace for 200 years, held back the tide of barbarism for
two centuries more, and transmitted the classic heritage to the West
before she died.</p>
<p>Rome has had no rival in the art of government. The Roman state com-
mitted a thousand political crimes; it built its edifice upon a selfish
oligarchy and an obscurantist priesthood; it achieved a democracy of
freemen, and then destroyed it with corruption and violence; it
exploited its conquests to support a parasitic Italy, which, when it
could no longer exploit, collapsed. Here and there, in East and West, it
created a desert and called it peace. But amid all this evil it formed a
majestic system of law which through nearly all Europe gave security to
life and property, incentive and continuity to industry, from the
Decemvirs to Napoleon. It molded a government of separated legislative
and executive powers whose checks and balances in- spired the makers of
constitutions as late as revolutionary America and France. For a time it
united monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy so suc- cessfully as to win
the applause of philosophers, historians, subjects, and enemies. It gave
municipal institutions, and for a long period municipal freedom, to half
a thousand cities. It administered its Empire at first with greed and
cruelty, then with such tolerance and essential justice that the great
realm has never again known a like content. It made the desert blossom
with civilization, and atoned for its sins with the miracle of a lasting
peace. Today our highest labors seek to revive the Pax Romana for a
disordered world.</p>
<p>Within that unsurpassed framework Rome built a culture Greek in
origin,</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>671</p>
<p>Roman in application and result. She was too engrossed in government
to create as bountifully in the realms of the mind as Greece had done;
but she absorbed with appreciation, and preserved with tenacity, the
technical, intel- lectual, and artistic heritage that she had received
from Carthage and Egypt, Greece and the East. She made no advance in
science, and no mechanical improvements in industry, but she enriched
the world with a commerce moving over secure seas, and a network of
enduring roads that became the arteries of a lusty life. Along those
roads, and over a thousand handsome bridges, there passed to the
medieval and modem worlds the ancient tech- niques of tillage,
handicraft, and art, the science of monumental building, the processes
of banking and investment, the organization of medicine and military
hospitals, the sanitation of cities, and many varieties of fruit and nut
trees, of agricultural or ornamental plants, brought from the East to
take new root in the West. Even the secret of central heating came from
the warm south to the cold north. The south has created the
civilizations, the north has conquered and destroyed or borrowed
them.</p>
<p>Rome did not invent education, but she developed it on a scale
unknown before, gave it state support, and formed the curriculum that
persisted till our harassed youth. She did not invent the arch, the
vault, or the dome, but she used them with such audacity and
magnificence that in some fields her architecture has remained
unequaled; and all the elements of the medieval cathedral were prepared
in her basilicas. She did not invent the sculptural portrait, but she
gave it a realistic power rarely reached by the idealizing Greeks. She
did not invent philosophy, but it was in Lucretius and Seneca that
Epicureanism and Stoicism found their most finished form. She did not
invent the types of literature, not even the satire; but who could
adequately record the influence of Cicero on oratory, the essay, and
prose style, of Virgil on Dante, Tasso, Milton, … of Livy and Tacitus on
the writing</p>
<p>of history, of Horace and Juvenal on Dryden, Swift, and Pope?</p>
<p>Her language became, by a most admirable corruption, the speech of
Italy, Rumania, France, Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; half the
white man’s world speaks a Latin tongue. Latin was, ti ll the eighteenth
century, the Esperanto of science, scholarship, and philosophy in the
West; it gave a convenient international terminology to botany and
zoology; it survives in the sonorous ritual and official documents of
the Roman Church; it still writes medical prescriptions, and haunts the
phraseology of the law. It entered by direct appropriation, and again
through the Romance languages ( regalis , regal, royal; paganus, pagan,
peasant), to enhance the wealth and flexibility of English speech. Our
Roman heritage works in our lives a thou- sand times a day.</p>
<p>When Christianity conquered Rome the ecclesiastical structure of
the</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>672</p>
<p>pagan church, the title and vestments of the pontifex maomnus , the
worship of the Great Mother and a multitude of comforting divinities,
the sense of supersensible presences everywhere, the joy or solemnity of
old festivals, and the pageantry of immemorial ceremony, passed like
maternal blood into the new religion, and captive Rome captured her
conqueror. The reins and skills of government were handed down by a
dying empire to a virile papacy; the lost power of the broken sword was
rewon by the magic of the consoling word; the armies of the state were
replaced by the missionaries of the Church moving in all directions
along the Roman roads; and the revolted provinces, accepting
Christianity, again acknowledged the sov- ereignty of Rome. Through the
long struggles of the Age of Faith the authority of the ancient capital
persisted and grew, until in the Renaissance the classic culture seemed
to rise from the grave, and the immortal city became once more the
center and summit of the world’s life and wealth and art. When, in 1936,
Rome celebrated the 2689th anniversary of her founda- tion, she could
look back upon the most impressive continuity of govern- ment and
civilization in the history of mankind. May she rise again.</p>
