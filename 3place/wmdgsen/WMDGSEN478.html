<p>1 7 1 4 - 5 6</p>
<p>I. THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>S HINING brilliantly with its own light in literature and
statesmanship, England was a humble satellite in music and art. The
retardation in art had many causes. The gloomy skies could hardly be one
of them, for skies gloomed in the Netherlands too, and yet Holland had
as many artists as windmills. The Channel may have been a cause,
shielding England from the arts as well as the wars of the Continent.
Perhaps English talent was too absorbed in commerce and (after Walpole)
in war. Protestantism might be blamed for the becalming of English art,
for art grows on imagination, and Protestantism had banished imagination
from art and dedicated it to litera- ture and theology; but, again,
Holland was Protestant. Probably the chief factor was the Puritan revolt
and legacy: the execution of the art-loving Charles I, the dispersion of
his art collection, and the recession of the Eng- lish mind — barring
Milton — during the chaotic Commonwealth. The Puritan influence bowed
its head during the Restoration, but it returned with Wil- liam III and
the Hanoverians, and in Methodism it took a reinvigorated form. Beauty
was again a sin.</p>
<p>There were some minor achievements in the minor arts. Fine soft-paste
porcelain was produced in Chelsea (17 55), imitating Meissen and Sevres.
Birmingham japanners made fortunes in lacquered ware; one of them, John
Baskerville, grew rich enough to indulge in printing fine editions of
English bards. Rococo curves in riotous fancy decorated books, fabrics,
furniture, ves- sels, Sheffield silver, the Rotunda at Vauxhall Gardens,
and some rooms in Chesterfield House and Strawberry Hill.</p>
<p>Sculptors were just beginning to be distinguished from masons. The
leading sculptors in England were of foreign birth, though they usually
became British citizens. Peter Schaemaekers came from Antwerp and joined
Laurent Delvaux in carving the statue of the Duke of Buckingham and
Normanbv in Westmin- ster Abbey. Greatest of these aliens was Louis
Fmubillac, son of a Lyonese banker. Coming to England in 1744, he was
rapidly advanced as a protege of the Walpoles. He executed the bust of
Shakespeare now in the British Museum, and that of Handel now in the
National Portrait Gallery. Queen Caroline favored him, sat for him,
commissioned him to make busts of Boyle, Newton,</p>
<p>2I 4</p>
<p>CHAP. VI ;</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>2I 5</p>
<p>Locke, and other English worthies for her grotto at Richmond.
Chesterfield, a man of taste, called Roubiliac “the Pheidias of his
day.” 1 Roubiliac died a bankrupt in 1762, after a life of devotion to
his art.</p>
<p>Architecture was in a Palladian ecstasy. The rising wealth of upper
classes prospering discontentedly under the Walpolian peace financed a
thousand grand tours, during which British gentlemen imbibed a liking
for Roman temples and Renaissance palaces. Venice was always on the
itinerary; on the way the traveler stopped at Vicenza to admire
Palladio’s fafades; and on their return they littered England with
classical columns, architraves, and pediments. In 1715-25 Colin Campbell
issued his Vitruvius Britannicus , which became the bible of the
Palladians; William Kent ( 1727) and James Gibbs (1728) furthered the
style with their architectural manuals. In 1716 Richard Boyle, third
Earl of Burlington, printed a sumptuous edition of Palladio’s texts, and
in 1730 he published Palladio’s restoratio ns of ancient edifices. His
own country house at Chiswick included a replica of Palladio’s Villa
Rotonda at Vicenza, with</p>
<p>In 1719 he brought back with him from Rome a young architect, William
Kent, who had won a papal prize for his paintings and was also an
enthusiast for everything classical. Housed till his death in Burlington
House (still, in its second incarnation, a center of English art), Kent
became the most popular and versatile artist in England. He painted
ceilings at Houghton, Stowe, and Kensington Palace; he designed
furniture, dinner plate, mirrors, glass, a barge, and costumes for
fashionable ladies; he carved the statue of Shakespeare in the Abbey; he
was a leader in promoting the “natural” English garden; as an architect
he built the Temple of Ancient Virtue in the Stowe gardens, Devon- shire
House in Piccadilly, the Horse Guards House in Whitehall, and the
prodigious Holkham Hall in Norfolk.</p>
<p>In 1738 Lord Burlington submitted to the London City Council Kent’s
Palladian plan for Mansion House, residence of the lord mayor; a member
ob- jected that Palladio was a papist; Kent’s design was rejected;
George Dance the Elder, a Protestant, received the commission and
acquitted himself well. But in that year the excavations began at
Herculaneum; the discoveries there led to the unearthing of Pompeii
(1748 f.); in 1753 Robert Wood published The Ruins of Palmyra , and in
1757 The Ruins of Baalbek ; these revelations gave the classical
campaign in England an irresistible verve, and put an end to the baroque
exuberance that had flowered in V anbrugh’s palace for the Churchills,
Blenheim. In 1748 Isaac Ware, another protege of Burlington, built
Chester- field House in Curzon Street.</p>
<p>In their enthusiasm the Palladians forgot that classical architecture
had been designed for Mediterranean skies, not for English winds and
clouds. Colin Campbell was a special sinner in adopting Italian models
without adapting them to English winters; his Merew r orth Castle gave
scant entry to the sun, and the Houghton Hall that he built for Robert
Walpole sacrificed living space to majestic halls inviting icy drafts.
James Gibbs, a disciple of Christopher Wren,</p>
<p>21 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>used the classic style to fine effect in the Church of
St. Mary-le-Strand in Lon- don (17 14-17); its steeple is a lyric in
stone. To the Church of St. Clement Dane, built by Wren, Gibbs added
(1719) a steeple too lofty for its base, but still precariously
beautiful. He capped his work in 1721 with the classic portico and
Corinthian columns of St. Martin’s -in-the-Fields, at Trafalgar Square,
Finally in the Radcliffe Library (1737-47) he created a perfect harmony
of columns and dome at Oxford.</p>
<p>The architectural splendor of Bath was due principally to John Wood.
His dominating conception was to bind individual dwellings into a single
mass; so he designed and began, and his son John ably completed, the
massive “Royal Crescent”— thirty houses behind a united front of 114
Corinthian columns — severely but not irreparably damaged in the Second
World War. Nearby Wood Senior and Junior built the “Circus” (1754 -64),
a handsome circle of residences faced by a continuous frieze and a
three-tiered colonnade; here once lived the elder Pitt, Thomas
Gainsborough, and Clive of India. For thre e sides of “Queen Square”
Wood designed but never completed another series of homes united behind
a palatial Renaissance fa9ade. Much of this town-planning and -building
program was financed by Ralph Allen, whom Fielding took as model for
Squire Allworthy. For Allen the elder Wood raised a magnificent
Palladian palace at Prior Park (1735-43), two miles outside Bath.</p>
<p>The poverty of Britain’s masses was equaled by the splendor of her
pal - aces. Allen’s temple at Prior Park cost £ 240,000. A competitive
craze in - spired nobles and merchants to raise immense mansions for
hospitality and display. According to Hervey, Robert Walpole earned the
lasting enmity of Lord Townshend by building Houghton Hall on a still
more lavish scale than Townshend’s neighboring Raynham Park. Lord
Lyttleton denounced this “epidemical madness” of palatial building; his
wife, however, demanded a new palace, in Italian style; he yielded to
her at the point of repetition and to the point of bankruptcy; when the
palace was finished she left him for an Italian opera singer of
uncertain sex. Soon England and even English Ireland were dotted with
such show houses of the rich. Tours were organ- ized, guidebooks were
published, for visiting these lordly dwellings, their gardens, and their
picture galleries. The fame of these edifices reached as far as Russia;
Catherine the Great asked Josiah Wedgwood to make her an imperial table
service decorated with views of English country seats. 2</p>
<p>Most of the paintings in England were housed, and for the most part
concealed, in these aristocratic homes; there were as yet no museums
where pictures could be viewed by the general public. Patronage went
chiefly to foreign artists, and almost entirely for portraits of
notables who hoped to live on canvas while rotting in wood; there was no
market for landscapes or “histories.” When Carle Vanloo came to England
in 1737 so many</p>
<p>pedigreed faces clamored to be pictured that for several weeks after
his arrival the train of carriages approaching his home rivaled that
before a</p>

<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>heater. Large sums were given to the man who kept the register of his
engagements, as bribes to advance their appointments; else one might
have to wait six weeks. 3</p>
<p>The “Royal Society of Arts,” founded in 1754, tried to stimulate
native talent with competitions and exhibitions, but the demand for
English art dallied for another generation. Joseph Highmore, a pupil of
Kneller, se- cured a few purchasers by picturing scenes from Pamela ,*
and Thomas Hudson caught a fraction of Handel’s vitality in the portrait
that he painted in 1 749.® Among Hudson’s pupils was young Joshua
Reynolds, “who,” he predicted, “will never distinguish himself.” 8 Sir
James Thornhill had more foresight. He won success with portraits of
Newton, Bentley, and Steele; he painted the inner cupola of St. Paul’s,
and ceilings at Greenwich Hospi - tal and Blenheim Palace; and he
achieved vicarious immortality by surren- dering his daughter in
marriage to the greatest English artist of the age.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WILLIAM HOGARTH; 1697-1764</li>
</ol>
<p>His father was a schoolteacher plus literary hack, who apprenticed
him in early youth to an engraver of arms. From this he passed to
engraving on copper, and from this to making illustrations for books. In
1726 he prepared twelve large engravings for Butler’s Hudibras. He
joined Thornhill’s art class, learned oil painting , and eloped with the
master’s daughter; Thornhill forgave him and engaged him as aide.</p>
<p>The illustrations that Hogarth made for The Tempest, 2 Henry IV, and
The Beggar’s Opera were vivid images; Miranda tender, Caliban coarse,
Prospero kindly, Ariel strumming a lute in the air; Sir John Falstaff
pon- tificating from his paunch; Captain Macheath in his irons and
arias, still a hero to his wives. The coming satirist struck his
distinctive vein in The Sleeping Congregation, for Hogarth hated all
homilies except his own; while in A Children’s Party he relished the
fairest phase of English life. These pictures please us now, but drew no
plaudits then.</p>
<p>He tried his hand at portrait painting, to indifferent results. The
compe- tition was severe. A dozen artists were making minor fortunes by
flattering their sitters and dividing their tasks; they painted the head
but delegated backgrounds and draperies to underpaid subordinates; “all
this,” said Ho - garth, “is done at so easy a rate as enables the pri
ncipal to get more money in a week than a man of the first professional
talents can in three months.” 7 He denounced the “phiz - mongers” who
prettified the faces of their clients to feed their vanity and open
their purses. As for himself he would portray his sitters with all their
carbuncles, or not at all. When a distinctively simian noble sat for his
picture Hogarth painted him with offensive hon-</p>
<p>218 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>esty. The lord, never having seen himself as others saw him, refused
to take the portrait. The artist sent him a message:</p>
<p>Mr. Hogarth’s dutiful respects to Lord. Finding that he does</p>
<p>not mean to have the picture which was drawn for him, is informed
again of Mr. Hogarth’s need for the money. If, therefore, his Lordship
does not send for it in three days, it will be disposed of, with the
addi- tion of a tail and some other little appendages, to Mr. Hare, the
famous wild-beast man; Mr. Hogarth having given that gentleman a
condi-</p>
<p>ional promise of it for an exhibition picture… 8</p>
<p>His Lordship paid.</p>
<p>Hogarth was confident that he could paint portraits as well as any
man. When he was portraying Henry Fox (later Baron Holland) he told
Horace Walpole that he had promised Fox, if he would sit as instructed,
that he, Hogarth, would make as good a portrait of him as Rubens or
Vandyck could have done; 9 which shocked Horace to the very core of his
conven- tions. Many of Hogarth’s male portraits ma y justify the
distaste that Wal- pole expressed for them; the faces are too
stereotyped, and some deserve his own scornful labeling of certain
English portraits as “still life.” We must except Sir Thomas Coram,
already noted in commemorating the Foundling Hospital, which Coram
founded and where he hangs; Hogarth caught the philanthropic nature in
the smiling face, and the firm character in the closed hands. Generally
the artist’s brush was kinder to women than to men. The Portrait of a
Lady 10 rivals Gainsborough; A Lady in Brown 11 has the strong features
of a woman who has successfully mothered many children; and if Miss Mary
Edwards 12 is slightly dead, it is brought to life by the — in Hogarth
always present — dog. Finer are the group portraits, like The Price
Family 13 and The Graham Children ; u and better still Hogarth’s
Servants, 15 where every face is fondly limned in all its unduplicable
charac- ter. Finest of all, of course, is The Shrimp Girl 16 — not a
portrait but a hale man’s memory of the young woman he had seen peddling
shrimp from a basket balanced on her head; a girl free from all frills,
not ashamed of the rags that robe her, looking out upon the world with
the health of action ruddying her cheeks and brightening her eyes.</p>
<p>Hogarth left at least four portraits of himself. In 1 745 he painted
himself with his fat dog Trump. 17 In 1758 he showed himself at his
easel: short, stout body, round and pudgy face, broad pug nose, blue
eyes tired with fighting, lips tight with readiness to fight again. He
was “a jovial, honest London citizen,” in Thackeray’s view, “a hearty,
plain -spoken man, loving his laugh, his friends, his glass, his roast-
beef of Old England.” 18 He was hardly five feet tall, but he wore a
sword 19 and took no nonsense from any man. Behind his defensive
pugnacity was a warm heart, sometimes senti-</p>

<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>mental, forever pledged to war against hypocrisy and cruelty. He
despised the lords whom he painted, he liked the simple Londoner who put
on no airs. He brought the English masses into art; he pictured them in
their sins and sufferings, in Bedlam, prison, debt, and heavy toil. He
disliked the French as having corrupted England with finicky finery and
aristocratic airs. He never forgot his being arrested for making
sketches of Calais Gate; he took revenge by picturing the French as he
had seen them there: rugged workmen, superstitious populace, and fat
monk gazing in ecstasy upon a shoulder of beef. 20</p>
<p>In his Anecdotes Hogarth told how the unprofitableness of his
portraits turned him into the line that made his fame:</p>
<p>I was unwilling to sink into a portrait manufacturer; and still
ambitious of being singular [working independently], dropped all
expectations of advantage from that source… As I could not bring myself
to</p>
<p>act like some of my brethren, and make it a sort of manufactory to be
carried on by the help of background and drapery painters, it was</p>
<p>not sufficiently profitable to pay the expenses my family required.
I</p>
<p>herefore turned my thoughts to painting and engraving modern moral
subjects, a field not broken up in any country or any age. 21</p>
<p>So in 1731 he painted six pictures which he called A Harlot’s
Progress; he engraved them on copper; from these engravings he made a
series of prints which a year later were offered for sale. The girl
arriving from the country is introduced to an itching gentleman by a
persuasive procuress; the lass is a ready learner, and soon reaches an
insolent prosperity. She is arrested not for prostitution but for theft;
she does her stint in jail, beating hemp; she progresses quickly to
disease and death, but she has the consola- tion of having a bevy of
courtesans follow her funeral. Hogarth could eas- ily have taken his
characters from life; we have seen Mrs. Needham exposed in the pillory
for prostitution, pelted by the populace, and dying of her injuries.
(However, Colonel Charteris, twice accused of rape and twice condemned
to death, was twice pardoned by the King, and died in state at his
country seat.) 22 Hogarth was mistaken in thinking that he broke new
ground in these genre prints; there had been many such in Renaissance
Italy, in France, in the Netherlands, in Germany. But Hogarth now made
an art and philosophy of “moral subjects.” Like most moralists he was
not himself immaculate; he had borne without horror the company of
drunk- ards and prostitutes, 23 and his prints were designed first to
make money and then, if possible, saints.</p>
<p>The Harlot prints sold well, appealing to twelve hundred subscribers
and netting over a thousand pounds. Though pirated editions clipped the
artist’s coin, they drove the wolf from the door. The British public,
which had no</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>passion for paintings, took readily to these scenes of sin. Here was
forbid- den fruit, sterilized by morality but delightful none the less;
here for a pit- tance one could make safe acquaintance with vice, and
watch with satisfac- tion its proper punishment. With his earnings
Hogarth could now feed his family; indeed, he took a home in fashionable
Leicester Fields, and hung outside his door a golden head, indicating
his profession as an artist. Later he bought a country house at
Chiswick.</p>
<p>He painted some large pictures in the next few years, chiefly
Southwark Fair — •an English Brueghel— and a pretty group portrait, The
Edwards Fam- ily. But in 1733 he returned to prints, and paralleled his
Harlot with a series entitled A Rake’s Progress. A giddy-pated youth
suddenly inherits a rich estate; he abandons Oxford for London, enjoys
taverns and wenches, squanders his money, is hauled off for debts, is
rescued by his castoff mis- tress, recovers solvency by marrying an
elderly lady with one eye but much money; he gambles away his new
fortune at White’s, is jailed again, and ends his career insane in
“Bedlam” Hospital. It was a morality play in pictures easily understood
and graphically presenting a segment of life. To guard the Rake prints
from piracy, Hogarth campaigned for the legal pro- tection of his
rights. In 1735 Parliament passed “An Act for the Encourage - ment of
the Arts of Designing, Engravi ng, Etching, etc.”; this law, popu -
larly known as “Hogarth’s Act,” gave him an equivalent of copyright on
his prints. In 1745 he auctioned off the paintings from which he had en-
graved the Harlot and the Rake, and took in ^427.</p>
<p>Solvent and confident, he made another foray into painting. “I enter
- tained some hopes of succeeding in what the puffers in books call ’the
great</p>
<p>Nevertheless these works did not earn critical acclaim. Hogarth
turned back (1745) to the satire of London life in engravings where the
burin pointed a moral with a tale. In the first scene of Marriage a la
Mode a bank- rupt gouty earl contracts to marry his title and unwilling
son to the unwill- ing daughter of an opulent alderman. The Earl
displays the family pedigree</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>as a tree on a scroll; the lawyer sprinkles blotting powder on the
signatures; the bridegroom turns away from the bride, who lends an ear
to her para- mour; and two dogs monopolize the domestic peace. In the
next scene the married couple are already at odds: the young lord has
returned exhausted from an all-night adventure whose n ature is signaled
by a girl’s lace cap protruding from his pocket; the young wife yawns
after spending the night entertaining company with music, gambling, and
small talk; again only the dog is happy. The third scene is Hogarth at
his boldest: the lordly scoun- drel brings his mistress to a quack
doctor for an abortion. Scene four shows the wife having her hair
dressed at her levee, or morning reception; her lover is with her, and
she ignores the music played or sung by her guests, who include a
deviate with curling papers in his hair. In the fifth scene her husband
has caught her with her lover; the two men draw their swords; the
husband is mortally wounded; the lover flees through the window; the
wife is overcome with remorse; a constable appears at the door. In the
final scene the young widow is dying; her father, removing a costly ring
from her finger, salvages the last remnant of the fortune that he had
paid for her title.</p>
<p>In 1751 Hogarth announced that he would sell at auction, at a given
hour in his studio, the oil paintings that he had made for Marriage h la
Mode; but he warned picture dealers to stay away. Only one person
appeared, who bid £ 1 26 for the pictures and their frames. Hogarth let
them go at this price, but privately raged at what he rated a shameful
failure. In 1797 these paintings brought ,£1,381; today they are among
the most highly prized possessions of London’s National Gallery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had earned the ire of the King with The March of the
Guards toward Scotland (1745). This was the year of Bonnie Prince</p>
<p>Charlie’s attempt to overthrow the Hanoverians. Hogarth pictured the
Royal Guards assembling at Finchley, a suburb of London. A fifer and a
drummer summon them; the soldiers accept their fate with the help of in-
toxication; they are a sorry-looking lot, fitter for a tavern carouse
than for a rendezvous with heroic death. The artist had the painting
shown to George II with request for permission to dedicate it to him.
The King re- fused. “What?” he exclaimed. “A painter burlesque a
soldier? He deserves to be picketed [imprisoned] for his insolence. Take
his trumpery out of my sight!” Hogarth, says an uncertain story,
dedicated the picture to Frederick the Great as “an encourager of arts
and sciences.” 28</p>
<p>He resumed his satirical prints. In twelve plates entitled Industry
and Idleness (1747) he traced the careers of two apprentices. Frank
Goodchild works hard, reads good books, goes to church every Sunday,
marries his m aster’s daughter, gives alms to the poor, becomes sheriff,
alderman, lord mayor of London. Tom Idle snores over his loom, reads
wicked books like</p>

<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Moll Flanders, drinks, gambles, picks pockets, is brought before
Alderman Goodchild, who, weeping with mercy, condemns him to be hanged.
Two engravings, Gin Lane and Beer Street (1751), contrasted the
“dreadful consequences of gin- drinking” with the who lesome effects of
beer. The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751) aimed, said the artist, “to
correct that bar - barous treatment of animals, the very sight of which
renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling
mind. I am more proud of having been the author [of these prints] than I
should be of having painted Raphael’s Cartoons.” 29 He aimed at fancier
evils in Four Prints of an Elec - tion ( 1755-58) , which attacked the
corruption of English politics.</p>
<p>Taken merely as drawings, Hoga rth’s prints are crude in conception
and execution, hasty and sketchy in detail. But he thought of himself as
an au- thor or playwright rather than an artist; he resembled his friend
Fielding more than his favorite enemy, William Kent; he was presenting a
picture of the age rather than displaying the techniques of art. “I have
endeavored</p>
<p>The art critics, collectors, and dealers of the time acknowledged
neither Hogarth’s ability as an artist nor his truth as a satirist. They
charged him with picturing only the dregs of English life. They taunted
him with hav- ing turned to popular prints through inability to paint
successful portraits or historical scenes; and they condemned his
drawing as careless and inac- curate. He retorted by denouncing the
dealers as conspiring to praise their stock of Old Masters, while
letting live artists starve:</p>
<p>Unsanctioned by their authority and unascertained [not guaranteed] by
tradition, the best preserved and highest finished picture… will not, at
a public auction, produce five shillings; while a despicable,</p>
<p>damaged, and repaired old canvas, sanctioned by their praise, shall
be purchased at any price, and find a place in the noblest collections.
All this is very well understood by the dealers. 31</p>
<p>He refused to submit his judgment to such dealers or connoisseurs. He
in- veighed against the enslavement of English painters to the imitation
of Vandyck or Lely or Kneller; even the giants of Italian art were
nicknamed</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) ART AND MUSIC 223</p>
<p>“Black Masters” by him, as having cast a pall upon English painting
by the black magic of their brown sauce. When a picture attributed to
Correggio brought four hundred pounds at a London sale, he questioned
the attribu- tion and the value, and offered to paint as good a picture
any time he liked. Challenged, he produced Sigismunda (1759) 32 — a good
imitation of Cor- reggio, with lace and finery and delicate hands and
lovely face; but the eyes were too melancholy to please the prospective
purchaser, who refused to pay the four hundred pounds that Hogarth asked
for it. It was sold after his death for fifty-six pounds.</p>
<p>He gave another handle to his enemies by writing a book. On the
palette in his portrait of himself and his dog (1745) he had traced a
serpentine line which seemed to him to be the basic element of beautiful
form. In a peda- gogical treatise, Analysis of Beauty (1753), he defined
this line as that formed by winding a wire in even progression around a
cone. Such a line, he thought, was not only the secret of grace but also
the movement of life. All this, to Hogarth’s critics, seemed to be vapid
moonshine.</p>
<p>Despite them he prospered. His prints were in almost every literate
home, and their continuing sale gave him a steady income. In 1757, his
March of the Guards having been forgotten, he was appointed “Serjeant
Painter of all his Majesty’s Works,” which brought him an additional two
hundred pounds a year. He could now afford new enemies. In 1762 he
issued a print, The Times , which attacked Pitt, Wilkes, and others as
warmongers. Wilkes replied in his journal, The North Briton , describing
Hogarth as a vain and avaricious old man incapable of a “single idea of
beauty.” Hogarth retali - ated by publishing a portrait of Wilkes as a
squint- eyed monster. Wilkes’s friend Churchill answered with a savage
“Epistle to William Hogarth”; Hogarth issued a print showing Churchill
as a bear. “The pleasure and pe - cuniary advantage which I derived from
these two engravings,” he wrote, “together with occasional riding on
horseback, restored me to as much health as can be expected at my time
of life.” 33 But on October 26, 1764, he burst an artery and died.</p>
<p>He left no visible mark on the art of h is time. In 1734 he opened a
“life school” to train artists; it was merged in 1768 with the Royal
Academy of Arts. Even the artists educated in his studio abandoned his
realism for the fashionable idealism of Reynolds and Gainsborough. His
influence was felt, however, in the field of caricature; there his humor
and force passed down through Thomas Rowlandson to Isaac and George
Cruikshank, and cari- cature became an art. Hogarth’s present high
repute as a painter began with Whistler’s remark that Hogarth was “the
only great English painter”; 34 Whistler carefully excluded himself from
the comparison. A less cautious judge ranked Hogarth, “taking him at his
best,” as “the supreme figure in eighteenth- century painting.” 35 This
estimate represents th e current de-</p>

<p>preciation of Reynolds as a money-making beautifier of aristocrats.
It is a mood that will pass. It is hard to rank Hogarth as an artist,
because he was not only that; he was the voice of England angry at its
own squalor and degradation; he rightly considered himself a social
force. Fielding so under- stood him: “I almost dare affirm that those
two works of his, which he calls The Rake’s and Harlot’s Progress, are
calculated more to serve the cause of virtue… than all the folios of
morality which have ever been writ- ten.” 36 One thing is certain: he
was the most English English artist that ever</p>

<li>THE MUSICIANS</li>
</ol>
<p>It is one of the puzzles of history why England, which has
contributed so richly to economic and political development and theory,
to literature, science, religion, and philosophy, has been relatively
barren in the more complex forms of musical composition since the age of
Elizabeth I. The passage from Catholicism may serve as a partial
explanation: the new faiths offered less inducement to lofty musical
productions; and though Lutheran ritual in Germany and the Anglican in
England called for music, the se- verer forms of Protestantism in
England and the Dutch Republic gave little encouragement to any music
above the congregational hymn. The legends and liturgy of the Roman
Church, often stressing the joys of faith, were replaced by somber
predestinarian creeds stressing the fear of hell; and only Orpheus could
sing in the face of hell. The madrigals of Elizabethan Eng- land died in
the Puritan frost. The Restoration brought a merrier spirit from France,
but after the death of Purcell a pall fell upon English music again.</p>
<p>Except for songs. These ranged from the corporate sonorities of glee
clubs to the airy delicacy of lyrics from Shakespeare’s plays. The word
glee was the Anglo-Saxon gleo, meaning music; it did not necessarily
imply joy. Usually it was applied to unaccompanied songs for three or
more parts. Glee clubs flourished for a century, reaching their peak
toward 1780 in the heyday of the chief composer of glees, Samuel Webbe.
More beautiful were Thomas Arne’s settings for Shakespeare’s songs—
“Blow, blow, thou winter wind,” “Under the greenwood tree,” and “Where
the bee sucks, there suck I”; these are still heard in England. It was
the melodious Arne who put to music Thomson’s “Rule, Britannia!” Now, or
earlier, some un - known patriot composed the national anthem of
Britain, “God Save the King.” So far as we know, this was first publicly
sung in 1745, when news came that the forces loyal to George II had been
defeated at Prestonpans by the Scots under the Young Pretender, and the
Hanoverian dynasty seemed</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>22 5</p>
<p>doomed. In its earliest known form (differing only slightly from the
cur- rent words and melody), it asked God for victory over the Jacobite
faction in English politics as well as over the Stuart army advancing
from Scot- land:</p>
<p>God save our Lord the King,</p>
<p>Long live our noble King [George II],</p>
<p>God save the King.</p>
<p>Send him victorious,</p>
<p>Happy and glorious,</p>
<p>Long to reign over us;</p>
<p>God save the King.</p>
<p>O Lord our God arise,</p>
<p>Scatter his enemies,</p>
<p>And make them fall;</p>
<p>Confound their politicks,</p>
<p>Frustrate their knavish tricks,</p>
<p>On him [now Thee] our hopes are fixed;</p>
<p>O save us all. 37</p>
<p>The melody was adopted for varying periods by nineteen other
countries for patriotic songs, including Germany, Switzerland, Denmark,
and the United States of America, which in 1931 replaced “America” as
national anthem by “The Star - Spangled Banner,” sun g to an
unmanageable tune from an old English drinking song.</p>
<p>The popularity of exquisite songs in England shows a widespread
musical taste. A harpsichord was in nearly everv home except among the
poor. Almost everyone played some instrument, and there were performers
numerous enough to provide, for the Handel commemoration program of 1784
in Westminster Abbey, ninety-five violins, twenty-six violas, twenty-one
violoncellos, fifteen double basses, six flutes, twenty-six oboes,
twelve trumpets, twelve horns, six trombones, and four drums, plus a
choir of fifty-nine sopranos, forty-eight altos, eighty-three tenors,
and eighty-four basses — enough to make Handel tremble in his Abbey
tomb. The clarinet was not admitted till later in the cen- tury. There
were magnificent organs, and great organists like Maurice Greene, whose
anthems and Te Deums — along with those of Handel and Boyce — were
almost the only memorable church music of England in that age.</p>
<p>William Boyce, though his hearing was impaired in youth, rose- to be
master of the King’s Band (i.e., orchestra) and organist in the Chapel
Royal. He was the first maestro to conduct standing; Handel and other
contemporaries con- ducted from the organ or harpsichord. Some of his
anthems — especially “By the Waters of Babylon”— are still heard in
Anglican churches; and English homes still hear at least two of his
songs: “Hearts of Oak,” which he wrote for one of</p>

<p>The only excitement in the English musical world at the outset of the
eighteenth century was the coming of opera. There had been such per-
formances as far back as 1674, but opera took the English fancy only
when, in 1702, Italian singers came from Rome. In 1708 a renowned
castrato , Nicolini, shocked and charmed London with his soprano voice.
Some other castrati came; England became accustomed to them, and went
wild over Farinelli. By 1710 there were enough Italian singers in London
to present there the first opera completely in their language. Many
protests were raised against the invasion. Addison devoted the
eighteenth number of The Spectator to it, proposing to</p>
<p>deliver down to posterity a faithful account of the Italian
opera….</p>
<p>Our great-grandchildren will be very curious to know the reason why
their forefathers used to sit together like an audience of foreigners in
their own country, to hear whole plays acted before them in a tongue
which they did not understand.</p>
<p>He concluded from the plots that in opera “nothing is capable of
being well se t to music, that is not nonsense.” He laughed at scenes
where the hero made love in Italian and the heroine answered him in
English — as if language mattered in such crises. He objected to lavish
scenery — to actual sparrows flying about the stage, and Nicolini
shivering in an open boat on a paste- board sea.</p>
<p>Addison had a grudge: he had written the libretto for Thomas
Clayton’s English opera Rosamond , which had failed. 38 His blast (March
21, 1711) was probably set off by the premiere, on February 24, of an
Italian opera, Rinaldo , at the Haymarket opera house. To complicate the
insult, while the words were Italian the music was by a German recently
arrived in Eng- land. To Addison’s dismay the new opera was a great
triumph: within three</p>

<p>The most famous composer of Johann Sebastian Bach’s time was Georg
Friedrich Handel.* He triumphed in Germany, he brought musical Italy</p>
<p>In Germany he signed himself Handel; in Italy and England, Hendel.
41</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) ART AND MUSIC 227</p>
<p>o his feet, he was the life and history of music in England for the
first half of the eighteenth century. He took his supremacy for granted,
and no one questioned him. He bestrode the world of music like a
commanding colos- sus, weighing 2 50 pounds.</p>
<p>He was born in Halle, Upper Saxony, February 23, 1685, just twenty-
six days before Johann Sebastian Bach, and eight months before Domenico
Scarlatti. But whereas Bach and Scarlatti were baptized in music,
fathered by famous composers, and reared to an obbligato of scales,
Handel was born to parents indifferent to tones. His father was official
surgeon at the court of Duke Johann Adolf of Saxe-Weissenfels; his
mother was the daughter of a Lutheran minister. They frowned upon the
boy’s addiction to the organ and the harpsichord; but when the Duke,
hearing him play, insisted that he should receive musical training, they
allowed him to study with Friedrich Zachau, organist of the
Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. Zachau was a devoted and painstaking teacher.
By the age of eleven Georg was composing sonatas (six of these survive),
and was so skilled an organist that Zachau and the resigned parents sent
him to Berlin to perform before So- phia Charlotte, the cultured
Electress of Brandenburg, soon to be queen of Prussia. When Georg
returned to Halle (1697), he found that his father had just died. His
mother survived till 1729.</p>
<p>In 1702 he entered the University of Halle, ostensibly to prepare for
the practice of law. A month later the authorities at the Calvinist
cathedral in Halle engaged him to replace their hard-drinking organist.
After a year there the restless young genius, craving a wider sphere,
pulled up all his Halle roots except his abiding love for his mother,
and set out for Ham- burg, where music was almost as popular as money.
Hamburg had had an opera house since 1678. There Handel, aged eighteen,
found a place as second violinist. He became friends with the
twenty-two-year-old Johann Mattheson, the leading tenor at the opera and
later the most famous musical critic of the eighteenth century. Together
they made an expedition to Lii- beck (August, 1703) to hear the aging
Buxtehude play, and to explore the possibility of succeeding him as
organist in the Marienkirche. They found that the suc cessor must marry
Buxtehude’s daughter. They looked and came away.</p>
<p>Their friendship collapsed in a duel as absurd as in any play. On
October 20, 1704, Mattheson produced and starred in his own opera,
Cleopatra. It was a decided success, and was often repeated. In these
performances Han- del conducted orchestra and singers from the
harpsichord. On some occa- sions Mattheson, drunk with glory, came down
from the stage after dying as Antony, displaced his friend as conductor
and harpsichordist, and shared happily in the final applause. On
December 5 Handel refused to be so re- placed. The friends expanded the
opera with a warm dispute, and after the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>stage performance was over they proceeded to the public square, drew
their swords, and fought to the plaudits of opera patrons and
passers-by. Matthe- son’s weapon struck a metal button on Handel’s coat,
buckled, and broke. The tragedy became a comedy to all but the
principals; they nursed their grievances until the director of the
company accepted Handel’s opera Al - mira, which required Mattheson in
the tenor role. The success of the opera (January 8, 1705) made the
enemies friends again.</p>
<p>Having forty-one arias in German and fifteen in Italian, Almira was
so popular that it was repeated twenty times in seven weeks. Reinhard
Keiser, who controlled the company and had composed most of its operas,
turned jealous. The Hamburg opera declined in popularity, and for two
years Handel lived at a reduced rate. Meanwhile Prince Giovan Gastone
de’ Medici, passing through Hamburg, had advised him to go to Italy,
where everyone was mad about music, and waiters warbled bel canto. With
two hundred ducats in his wallet, and a letter from Gastone to his
brother Ferdinand, patron of opera in Florence, Handel dared the snows
of the Alps in December, and reached Florence toward the end of 1706.
Finding Ferdinand’s pockets buttoned, he passed d own to Rome. There,
however, the opera house had been closed by Pope Innocent XII as a
center of im- morality. Handel played the organ in the Church of San
Giovanni Later- ano, and was acclaimed as a virtuoso; but as no one
would produce his new opera, he returned to Florence. Gastone was now
there, and pleaded for him; Ferdinand opened his purse, Rodrigo was
staged; everyone was pleased; Ferdinand gave the young composer a
hundred sequins (00?) and a dinner service of porcelain. But Florence
had no public opera house; Venice had sixteen. Handel went on to
Venice.</p>
<p>It was the fall of 1707. The Queen of the Adriatic was under the
spell of Alessandro Scarlatti, and was applauding his greatest opera,
Mitridate Eupatore; there was no opening for a young German just
beginning to learn the secrets of Italian melody. Handel studied
Scarlatti’s operas, and found a good friend in Alessandro’s son. Story
has it that when Handel, masked, played the harpsichord at a Venetian
masquerade, Domenico Scarlatti ex- claimed, “That is either the
marvelous Saxon or the Devil.” 42 The lasting friendship between the two
greatest harpsichordists of the age is a moment of harmony amid the
discords of history. Together they left Venice to older masters, and
went off to Rome (January, 1 708? ).</p>
<p>This time Handel was better received. The news of Rodrigo had reached
the capital; princes and cardinals opened their doors to him, more
disturbed by his German accent than by his Lutheran faith. The Marchese
di Ruspoli b uilt a private theater in his palace to produce Handel’s
first oratorio, La Risurrezione; the music was a revelation in its
power, complexity, and depth; soon all cultural Rome was talking about
“i/ gran Sassone the tall</p>
<p>CHAP. VI )</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>22 9</p>
<p>and mighty Saxon. But his scores were more difficult than Italian
perform- ers liked. When Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni produced Handel’s
Serenata the music troubled Arcangelo Corelli, who played first violin
and conducted the orchestra; he murmur ed politely, “ Caro Sassone, this
music is in the French style, which I do not understand.” 43 Handel took
the violin from Corelli’s hands and played with his usual dash. Corelli
forgave him.</p>
<p>Naples remained to be conquered. An unreliable tradition describes
Han- del, Corelli, and both the Scarlattis as traveling to that city
together (June,</p>
<p>1708). Another dubious story ascribes a love affair to Handel there;
but cautious history regrettably admits that it has no sound evidence of
any love affair an ywhere in Handel’s life, except for his mother and
music. It seems incredible that the man who could write such ardent
arias had no flame of his own; perhaps expression dispersed its heat on
the wings of song. So far as we know, the major event in this Neapolitan
sojourn was Handel’s meeting with Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani, Viceroy of
Naples and scion of a rich Venetian family. He offered the composer the
libretto of an opera on the old theme of Nero’s mother. In three weeks
Handel completed the work. Grimani arranged for its performance in the
theater of his family at Venice; Handel hurried thither with the
score.</p>
<p>The premiere of Agrippina (December 26, 1709) was the most exhilarat-
ing triumph that Handel had yet experienced. The generous Italians were
not jealous that a German had beaten them at their own game, showing
them splendors of harmony, audacities of modulation, devices of
technique seldom achieved even by their favorite, Alessandro Scarlatti;
they cried out, “ Viva il caro Sassone !” 44 Part of the ovation went to
the remarkable basso, Giuseppe Boschi, whose voice ranged smoothly over
a gamut of twenty- nine notes.</p>
<p>Handel was now courted. Charles Montagu, Earl of Manchester, British
ambassador at Venice, advised him to go to London; Prince Ernest Au-
gustus, younger brother of Elector George Louis, offered him the post of
Kapellmeister at Hanover. Venice was lovely, it breathed music, but how
long could one eat out of one opera, and how long could you depend upon
those temperamental Italians? At Hanover there would be fog and clouds
and gutturals, but also a fine opera house, a steady salary, substantial
Ger- man food; and he could ride off now and then to visit his mother at
Halle. On June 15, 1710, age twenty-five, Handel was appointed
Kapellmeister at Hanover, with an annual salary of fifteen hundred
crowns, and permission for occasional absences. In the autumn of that
year he asked and obtained permission to visit England, promising to
return soon.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Conquest of England</li>
</ol>
<p>London opera was in trouble. An Italian company was singing there,
with basso Boschi, his contralto wife, and male soprano Nicolini, whom
Charles Burney, zealous historian of music, judged to be “the first
truly great singer who has ever sung in our theater.” 45 But both the
Haymarltet</p>
<p>Theatre were in a rough section of the city, where pockets were
picked and heads were broken; “society” hesitated to risk its wigs and
purses there.</p>
<p>Hearing that Handel was in London, Aaron Hill, impresario, offered
him a libretto drawn from Tasso’s Gerusalemme liberata. Handel set to
wor k with his massive energy, borrowed freely from his own
compositions, and in a fortnight completed Rinaldo. Produced on February
24, 17 11, it was repeated fourteen times to full houses before the end
of the season on June 22. Addison and Steele attacked it, but London
took to it, and sang its arias in the streets; two especially, “Lascia
ch’io pianga” and “Cara sposa,” touched sentimental chords, and can move
us even today. John Walsh made fourteen hundred guineas by publishing
the songs from Rinaldo; Handel wryly suggested that for the next opera
Walsh should write the music and let him publish the score. 46 Soon this
best of Handel’s operas was produced in Dublin, Hamburg, and Naples. In
London it held the stage for twenty years.</p>
<p>Sipping his success, Handel stretched his leave of absence to a year;
then, reluctantly, he returned to Hanover (June, 17 1 1 ). There he was
not a lion in drawing rooms but a servant in the Elector’s palac e; the
opera house was closed for the season; he composed concerti grossi and
cantatas while his imagination soared in operas. In October, 1712, he
asked leave for another “short” visit to England. The Elector indulged
him, perhaps feeling that England was soon to be a Hanoverian appanage
in any case. Handel reached London in November, and stayed forty-six
years.</p>
<p>He brought with him a new opera, 11 Pastor Fido ( The Faithful Shep-
herd), whose pleasant overture still charms our air. It was produced on
November 22, and failed. Stimulated rather than disheartened, he began
at once on another theme, Teseo {Theseus). The premiere (January 10,</p>
<ol start="1713" type="1">
<li>was a triumph, but after the second night the manager absconded with
the box office receipts. Another manager, John Heidegger, took over,
carried Teseo to thirteen performances, and rewarded the unpaid composer
by arranging a benefit for “Mr. Hendel,” with the composer starring at
the harpsichord. The Earl of Burlington, an enthusiastic auditor,
invited Han- del to make Burlington House his home; Handel accepted, was
well lodged</li>

<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>23 1</p>
<p>and too well fed, and met Pope, Gay, Kent, and other leaders in
literature and art.</p>
<p>Good fortune crowded upon him. Queen Anne had longed for an end to
the War of the Spanish Succession; it came with the Treaty of Utrecht;
Handel pleased Anne with his “Utrecht Te Deum,” and with a “Birthday
Ode” for her anniversary; in these he showed that he had studied
Purcell’s choruses. The kindly Queen rewarded him with a pension of two
hundred pounds. Comfortable and prosperous, he rested on his oars for a
truant year.</p>
<p>On August ; , 1714, Anne died, and Elector George Louis of Hanover
became George I of England. Handel looked with some apprehension upon
this turn of events; he had in effect deserted Hanover, and might expect
the ;oyal shoulder to be cold. It was, but George held his peace. The
Hay- market house was now renamed His Majesty’s Theatre; the King felt
obliged to patronize it; but it was playing the truant’s Rinaldo. He
went in disguise except for his accent, and enjoyed the performance.
Meanwhile Handel had written another opera, Amadigi di Gaula; Heidegger
produced it on May 25, 1715; George liked it. Soon thereafter the
Italian violinist and composer Francesco Geminiani, being invited to
perform at court, asked for Handel as the only harpsichordist in England
who could fitly accom- pany him. He had his way; Handel outdid himself;
the King forgave him, and raised his pension to four hundred pounds a
year. Princess Caroline engaged him to teach her daughters, and added a
pension of two hundred pounds. He was now the best-paid composer in
Europe.</p>
<p>When George I left London (July 9, 1716) for a visit to Hanover
he</p>
<p>ook Handel with him. The musician visited his mother at Halle, and
began his periodic gifts of money to the impoverished widow of his old
teacher Zachau. King and composer returned to London early in 1717.
James Brydges, Earl of Carnarvon — later, Duke of Chandos — invited
Handel to live at his sumptuous palace, Canons, in Middlesex, and to
replace as its music master Dr. Johann Pepusch, who took delayed revenge
by writing the music for The Beggar’s Opera. There Handel composed
Suites de Pieces pour le Clavecin — harpsichord fantasies in the style
of Domenico Scarlatti and Couperin — some concerti grossi, twelve
“Chandos Anthems,” music for Gay’s masque Acis and Galatea, and an
opera, Radamisto.</p>

<p>raided various companies in Germany, and visited his mother again. A
few hours after he left Halle for England, Johann Sebastian Bach
appeared in the town, having walked some twenty-five miles from Cothen,
and asked if he might see the great German who had conquered England. It
was too late; the two masters never met.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1720, Radamisto was performed before the King, his mis-
tress, and a house brilliant with titles and jewelry; pedigreed persons
fought for admission; “several gentlemen,” Mainwaring reported, “were
turned back who had offered forty shillings fo r a seat in the gallery.”
48 The Eng - lish audience rivaled in its applause the Venetians who had
acclaimed Agrippina eleven years before. Handel was again the hero of
London.</p>
<p>Not quite. A rival group of music lovers, led by Handel’s former
patron the Earl of Burlington, preferred Giovanni Battista Bononcini.
They per- suaded the Royal Academy of Music to open its second season
with Bo- noncini’s opera Astarto (November 19, 1720); they secured for
its leading role a male soprano now more adored than Nicolini; this
“Senesino” (Fran - cesco Bernardi) , offensive in manners, captivating
in voice, carried Astarto to triumph and a run of ten performances;
Bononcini’s admirers hailed him as superior to Handel. Neither composer
was responsible for the war that now divided London’s operatic public
into hostile groups, but London, in this year of the bursting South Sea
Bubble, was as excitable as Paris. The King and the Whigs favored
Handel, the Prince of Wales and the Tories played up Bononcini, and the
wits and pamphleteers crowded to the fray. Bononcini seemed to certify
his supremacy with a new opera, Crispo (Jan- uary, 1722), which was so
successful that the Academy followed it with another Bononcini triumph,
Griselda. When the great Marlborough died (June), Bononcini, not Handel,
was chosen to compose the funeral an- them; and the Duke’s daughter
settled upon the Italian an annuity of five hundred pounds a year. It
was Bononcini’s year.</p>
<p>Handel fought back with Ottone, and a new soprano whom he lured from
Italy by an unprecedented guarantee of two thousand pounds. Fran- cesca
Cuzzoni, as Horace Walpole saw her, “was short and squat, with a doughy
cross face but fine complexion; was not a good actress; dressed ill; and
was silly and fantastical”; 49 but she warbled ravishingly. A contest of
wills and tempers enlivened her rehearsals. “Madame,” Handel told her,
“I well know that you are a veritable female devil; but I myself, I will
have you know, am Beelzebub, chief of the devils.” When she insisted on
sing - ing an aria contrary to his instructions, he took hold of her and
threatened to throw her out the window. 50 As the two thousand pounds
would have followed her, she yielded. In the premiere (January 12, 1723)
she sang so well that one enthusiast cried out from the gallery in
mediis rebus , “Damme, she has a nest of nightingales in her belly.” 51
Senesino rivaled her, and</p>

<p>233</p>
<p>Boschi’s basso helped. On the second night seats sold for five pounds
more. About this time John Gay wrote to Jonathan Swift:</p>
<p>As for the reigning amusement of the town, it is entirely music; real
fiddles, bass viols, and hautboys; not poetical harps, lyres, and reeds.
There’s nobody allowed to say I sing but an eunuch, or an Italian</p>
<p>woman. Everybody now is grown as great a judge of music as they</p>
<p>were, in your time, of poetry; and folks that could not distinguish
one tone from another now daily dispute about the different styles of
Han- del, Bononcini, and Attilio [Ariosti]…. In London and Westmin-</p>
<p>ster, in all polite conversation, Senesino is daily voted the
greatest man that ever lived. 52</p>
<p>Again in excelsis , Handel bought a house in London (1723) and became
a British citizen (1727). He continued till 1728 the operatic war.
He</p>
<p>combed history for subjects, and put Flavius, Caesar, Tamerlane,
Scipio, Alexander, and Richard I on the stage; Bononcini countered with
Astyanax, Erminia, Pharnaces, and Calpurnia; a third composer, Ariosti,
set Corio- lanus, Vespasian, Artaxerxes, and Darius to music; never had
history been so harmonious. In 1726 the triune conflict took on added
fire with the ar- rival of Faustina Bordoni, a mezzo-soprano who had
already overcome Venice, Naples, and Vienna. She had not the tender and
dulcet tones of Cuzzoni, but her voice was seconded by her face, her
figure, and her grace. In Alessaiidro (May 5, 1726) Handel brought the
two divas together, gave them the same number of solos, and carefully
balanced them in a duet. For some evenings the audience applauded them
both; then it divided; one part hissed while the other applauded; a new
dimension was added to the tuneful war. On June 6, 1727, whe n the rival
prime donne sang in Bononcini’s Astianatte, the supporters of Cuzzoni
broke out in a disgraceful pande- monium of hisses, boos, and roars when
Bordoni tried to sing. A fight flared up in the pit and spread to the
stage; the divas joined in it and tore at each other’s hair; spectators
joyfully smashed the scenery— all in the presence of the humiliated
Caroline, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>This reductio ad absurdum might of itself have killed Italian opera
in England. The coup de grace was struck by one of the gentlest spirits
in London. On January 29, 1728, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre, John
Gay presented The Beggar’s Opera. We have described its jolly, witty,
ribald lyrics, but only those who have heard them sung to the music that
Johann Pepusch composed or borrowed for them can understand why the
theater- going public turned almost en masse from Handel, Bononcini, and
Ariosti to Pepusch, Polly, and Gay. Night after night for nine weeks The
Beggar’s Opera played to full houses, while the sirens and eunuchs at
His Majesty’s Theatre sang to empty seats. Moreover, Gay had satirized
Italian opera;</p>
<p>234 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>he had made fun of the silly plots, the coloratura trills and
ornaments of sopranos of either sex; he had taken thieves, beggars, and
prostitutes as his dramatis personae instead of kings, nobles, virgins,
and queens; and he of- fered English ballads as better songs than
Italian arias. The public was de- lighted with words that it could
understand, especially if the words were a bit risque. Handel came back
with more operas — Siroe and Tolomeo, Re cTEgitto (1728); they had fine
moments but paid no bills. On June 5 the Royal Academy of Music declared
bankruptcy and expired.</p>
<p>Handel did not admit defeat. Deserted by the nobles, who blamed him
for their losses, he formed with Heidegger (June, 1728) the “New Acad -
emy of Music,” put into it ten thousand pounds— nearly all his savings —
and received from the new King, George II, a pledge of a thousand a year
in support. In February he set out on another Continental tour to
recruit new talent, for Cuzzoni, Bordoni, Senesino, Nicolini, and Boschi
had deserted his sinking ship and were trilling Venice. In their place
Handel engaged new chanticleers and nightingales: Antonio Bernacchi, a
male soprano, Annibale Fabri, tenor, Anna Maria Strada del Po, soprano.
On his way back he stopped to see his mother for the last time. She was
now seventy-nine, blind and almost paralyzed. While he was in Halle he
was visited by Wil- helm Friedemann Bach, who brought him an invitation
to visit Leipzig, where the Passion according to St. Matthew had just
received its first performance. Handel had to refuse. He had barely
heard of Johann Sebas- tian Bach, and never dreamed that this man’s fame
would one day eclipse his own. He hurried back to London, picking up on
the way the Hamburg basso Johann Riemenschneider.</p>
<p>The new cast appeared in Lotario on December 2, 1729, without suc-
cess. He tried again on February 24 with Partenope, without success.
Ber- nacchi and Riemenschneider were restored to the Continent; Senesino
was recalled from Italy; with him and Strada del Po, and a libretto by
Meta- stasio, Handel’s Poro— on which he had lavished some of his most
moving arias — caught the ear of London (February 2, 1731). His
Majesty’s Thea - tre filled again. Two further operas, Ezio and Sosanne,
were favorably received.</p>
<p>But the struggle to keep an English audience with Italian opera was
be- coming ever more arduous; it appeared now to be a blind alley, in
which physical and financial exhaustion was always around the corner.
Handel had conquered England, but now England was apparently conquering
him. His operas were too much alike, and were bound to wear thin. They
were exalted by magnificent arias; but these were only tenuously related
to the plot, they were in an unintelligible, however mellifluous,
language, and many of them were composed for male sopranos, who were
increasingly hard to find. Rigid rules and artistic jealousy governed
the distribution of</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi) ART AND MUSIC 235</p>
<p>arias, and added to the artificiality of the tale. If Handel had
continued on this Italian line he would hardly be remembered today. A
series of accidents jolted him off his beaten track, and turned him into
the field where he was to remain, even to our time, unsurpassed.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Defeat</li>
</ol>
<p>On February 23, 1732, at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Bernard Gates,
to celebrate the composer’s forty -seventh birthday, gave a private
produc- tion of Handel’s Esther, an Oratorio. It drew so profitable an
audience that</p>
<p>heater on May 2, but added that there would be “no action on the
stage,” and that the music was “to be disposed after the Manner of the
Coronation Service”; so he distinguished oratorio from opera. He
provided his own chorus and orchestra, and taught La Strada and other
Italians to sing their solos in English. The royal family attended, and
Esther bore five repeti- tions in its first month.</p>
<p>Another oratorio, Acts and Galatea (June 10), failed to please, and
Han- del turned back to opera. Orlando (January 27, 1733) had a good
run; even so, the partnership with Heidegger faced bankruptcy. When
Handel pro- duced his third oratorio, Deborah (March 17), he tried to
regain solvency by doubling the price of admission; an anonymous letter
to The Craftsman denounced this measure, and called for a revolt against
the domination of London’s music by the “insolent,… imperious, and
extravagant Mr. Hendel.” 53 As Handel had won the patronage of the King,
he automatically lost the good will of Frederick, Prince of Wales, son
and foe of George II. Handel, whose manners often yielded to his temper,
made the mistake of offending Frederick’s drawing master, Joseph Goupy;
Goupy took re - venge by drawing a caricature of the composer as a
monstrous glutton with the snout of a boar; copies of this were
circulated through London, and added to Handel’s misery. In the spring
of 1733 the Prince of Wales en - couraged his courtiers to form a rival
company, the “Opera of the Nobil - ity.” It brought from Naples the mo
st famous singing teacher of the age, Niccolo Porpora; lured Senesino
from Handel and Cuzzoni from Italy; and on December 29, at the Lincoln’s
Inn Fields Theatre, it produced Porpora’s</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>Arianna with great acclaim. Handel met this new challenge with an
opera on a defiantly similar theme, Arianna in Creta (January 26, 1734);
it too was well received. But at the end of the season his contract with
Heidegger expired; Heidegger leased His Majesty’s Theatre to the Opera
of the No - bility; and Handel moved his company to John Rich’s Covent
Garden</p>
<p>Theatre.</p>
<p>Porpora scored by calling upon the world’s most renowned castrato,
Carlo Broschi, known to all Europe as “Farinelli.” On this man’s singing
we may dilate when we meet him in his native Bologna; here it need
hardly be said that when (October 29) he joined Senesino and Cuzzoni in
Porpora’s Artaserse it was an event in the music history of England; the
opera was repeated forty times during Farinelli’s three -year stay. To
compete with it Handel offered Ariodante (January 8, 1735), one of his
finest operas, uniquely rich in its instrumental music; it earned ten
performances in two months, and promised to make ends meet. But when
Porpora produced Polifemo (February 1) with Farinelli in the leading
role, the King, the Queen, and the court could not stay away; its run
exceeded that of Arta- serse, while Handel’s Alcina (April 16) was soon
playing to empty se ats — though a suite from its score still appears on
programs today. For half a year Handel retired from the battlefield to
nurse his rheumatic pains with the waters of Tunbridge Wells.</p>
<p>On February 19, 1736, he returned to Covent Garden with an oratorio
set to Dryden’s “Alexander’s Feast.” A contemporary reported that the
capacity audience of thirteen hundred received the oratorio with
applause “such as had seldom been heard in London”; 54 Handel was
comforted with receipts of ^450; but though he gave a stirring organ
recital in the inter- mission the ode was too slight to bear more than
four repetitions; and the desperate
composer-impresario-conductor-virtuoso turned again to opera. On May 1 2
he offered Atalanta as a pastoral play celebrating the marriage of the
Prince of Wales. He had summoned from Italy a new castrato, Giz- ziello
(Gioacchino Conti), for the soprano role, and had distinguished the part
with an aria, “Care selve,” which is one of the most lovely and endur -
ing of his songs. Frederick was so pleased that he transferred his
patronage from Porpora’s company to Handel’s; but this victory was made
sorrowful when the King, hearing of his son’s move, canceled his annu al
subscription of a thousand pounds to Handel’s enterprise.</p>
<p>Porpora gave up the battle in the spring of 1736. Handel filled his
theater by alternating operas with oratorios, and adding to the cast of
Giustino (February 16, 1737) “bears, fantastic animals, and dragons
vomiting fire.” 55 But the strain of his diverse responsibilities broke
him down. In April he suffered a nervous collapse, and a stroke that for
a time paralyzed his right arm. On May 1 8 he staged Berenice, the last
of the operas that he wrote for</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>his company. He closed his theater on June 1, owing many debts, and
vow- ing to pay them all in full; he did. Ten days later the rival Opera
of the Nobility disbanded, owing twelve thousand pounds. The great age
of opera in England was over.</p>
<p>Handel’s health was among the ruins. Rheumatism in his muscles,
arthri - tis in his bones, gout in his extremities were capped in the
summer of 1737 with a passing attack of insanity. 56 He left England to
take the waters at Aachen. There, reported Sir John Hawkins,</p>
<p>he submitted to such sweats, excited by the vapor baths, as
astonished everyone. After a few essays of this kind, during which
spirits seemed to rise rather than sink under an excessive perspiration,
his disorder left him; and a few hours after… he went to the great
church of the</p>
<p>city, and got to the organ, on which he played in such a manner that
men imputed his cure to a miracle. 57</p>
<p>In November he returned to London, to solvency and honors. Heidegger
had again engaged His Majesty’s Theatre. He paid Handel a thousand
pounds for two new operas; one of them, Serse (April 15, 1738) contained
the famous “Largo,” “Ombra mai fu.” The lessee of Vauxhall Gardens paid
Roubiliac three hundred pounds for a statue showing the composer strum-
ming a lyre; on May 2 this figure, ungainly in pose and stupid in
expression, was unveiled in the Gardens with a musical entertainment.
More pleasing to Handel must have been the benefit tendered him on March
28, bringing over a thousand pounds in receipts. Handel now paid off the
more urgent of his creditors, one of whom was threatening to put him in
the debtors’ jail. Despite all honors, he was near the end of his
financial rope. He could no longer look to Heidegger, who announced (May
24) that he had not received sufficient subscriptions to warrant his
producing operas in 1738-</p>

<li><p>Without a commission and without a company, Handel, aged fifty-

period.</p></li>
<li><p>The Oratorios</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This relatively modern form had grown out of medieval chorales repre-
senting events in Biblical history or the lives of the saints.
St. Philip Neri had given the form its name by favoring it as a means of
devotion and re- ligious instruction in the oratorio , or prayer chapel,
of the Fathers of the Oratory in Rome. Giacomo Carissimi and his pupil
Alessandro Scarlatti developed the oratorio in Italy; Heinrich Schiitz
brought it from Italy into Germany; Reinhard Keiser raised the genre to
high excellence before his</p>
<p>238 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>death (1739). This was the heritage that in 1741 culminated in
Handel’s</p>
<p>Messiah.</p>
<p>Part of Handel’s success cam e from his adaptation of the form to
English taste. He continued to choose the subjects of his oratorios from
the Bible, but he gave them, now and then, a secular interest, as with
the love theme in Joseph and His Brethren and in Jephtha; he emphasized
the dramatic rather than the religious character, as in Saul and Israel
in Egypt; and he used an entirely English text, only partly Biblical. It
was in good part re- ligious music, but it was independent of churches
and liturgy; it was per- formed on a stage under secular auspices.
Moreover, Handel used Biblical themes to symbolize English history:
“Israel” stood for England; the Great Rebellion of 1642 and the Glorious
Revolution of 1688 could be heard in the struggle of the Jews for
liberation from Egyptian (Stuart) bondage and Hellenistic (Gallic)
domination; the Chosen People was really the English nation, and the God
of Israel was the same who had led the English people through trial to
victory. Like the Puritans, Handel thought of God as the mighty Jehovah
of the Old Testament, not as the forgiving Father of the New. 58 England
felt this, and responded proudly to Handel’s ora - torios.</p>
<p>The ascent to the Messiah began with Saul, produced at His Majesty’s
Theatre January 16, 1739. “The solemn and majestic Dead March would
alone immortalize this work.” 59 But the audience was not accustomed to
the oratorio form; Saul could sustain only six performances. With
unbelievable energy Handel composed and presented (April 4) another
masterwork, Israel in Egypt. Here he made the chorus the hero, the voice
of a nation in birth, and wrote what many consider his supreme music. 60
It proved too vast and heavy for the current appetite, and Handel
finished this historic season with new debts.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1739, England plunged into war with Spain for Jenkins’
ear. Amid the turmoil Handel hired a small theater, and on the feast of
the patron saint of musicians he offered his setting of Dryden’s “Ode
for St.</p>
<p>These two years were his finest. On August 22, 1741, he began to com-
pose the Messiah. The text was adapted by Charles Jennens from the books
of Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Lamentations, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>in the Old Testament, and, in the New, the Gospels of Matthew, Luke,
and John, the Epistles of Paul, and the Book of Revelation. The score
was com- pleted in twenty- three days; in some of these, he told a
friend, “I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the great God
himself.” 81 Having no early prospect of finding an audience for it, he
went on to write another major oratorio, Samson, based on the Samson
Agonistes of Milton. At an unknown date during these ecstasies he
received an invitation to present some of his works in Dublin. The
proposal seemed to come from an appre- ciative Providence; actually it
came from William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland.</p>
<p>He reached Dublin November 17, 1741. He engaged the best singers he
could find, including Susannah Maria Cibber, the accomplished daughter
of Thomas Arne. Several charitable organizations arranged six concerts
for him; these were so successful that a second series was presented. On
March 27,1 742, two Dublin periodicals carried an announcement that</p>
<p>for the relief of the Prisoners in the several Gaols, and for the
support of Mercer’s Hospital,… on Monday the 1 2th of April, will be per
-</p>
<p>formed, at the Musick Hall in Fishamble- street, Mr. Hendel’s new</p>
<p>Grand Oratorio, called the Messiah, in which the Gentlemen of the</p>
<p>Choir of both cathedrals will assist, with some Concertos on the
Organ by Mr. Hendel. 62</p>
<p>Tickets were sold also for the rehearsal on April 8, which Faulkner’s
Jour - nal reported as “performed so well that it… was allowed by the
greatest</p>
<p>At last, on April 13, 1742, the most famous of all major musical
compo- sitions was presented. On April 1 7 three Dublin papers carried
an identical review:</p>
<p>On Tuesday last Mr. Hendel’s Sacred Grand Oratorio, the Messiah,</p>
<p>was performed…. The best Judges allowed it to be the most fin-</p>
<p>ished piece of musick. Words are wanting to express the exquisite De-
light it afforded to the admiring crowded Audience. The Sublime, the
Grand, and the Tender, adapted to the most elevated, majestic and</p>
<p>moving Words, conspired to transport and charm the ravished Heart and
Ear. It is but justice to Mr. Hendel that the world should know he</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>generously gave the money arising from this Grand Performance to be
equally shared by the Society of relieving Prisoners, the Charitable In-
firmary, and Mercer’s Hospital, for which they will ever gratefully re -
member his Name. 63</p>
<p>The Messiah was repeated in Dublin on June 3. It has been repeated a
thousand times since; yet who has yet grown weary of those muted or
majestic arias, with their subdued and gracious accompaniments — “He
Shall Feed His Flock,” “I Know That My Redeemer Liveth,” “He Shall</p>
<p>Be Exalted,” “He Was Despised and Rejected”? When, at the Dublin
premiere, Mrs. Cibber sang this last air, an Anglican clergyman cried
out from the audience, “Woman, for this thy sins be forgiven thee!” All
the depth and fervor of religious hope, all the tenderness of pious
song, all the art and feeling of the composer came together to make
these arias the su- preme moments in modern music.</p>
<p>On August 13, replenished in spirit and purse, Handel left Dublin,
re- solved to conquer England again. He must have been comforted to find
that Pope, in the fourth book of The Dunciad (1742), had gone out of his
way to praise him:</p>
<p>Strong in new arms, lo! giant Handel stands,</p>
<p>Like bold Briareus, with a hundred hands [the orchestra] :</p>
<p>To stir, to rouse, to shake the soul he comes,</p>
<p>And Jove’s own thunders follow Mars’s drums.</p>
<p>So on February 18, 1743, at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, the
re- juvenated composer presented his oratorio Samson. George II led
London’s elite to the premiere; the lovely overture pleased everyone but
Horace Walpole, who was resolved nil admirari; the noble aria “O God of
Hosts” was almost of Messiahmc splendor; Samson , like Samson, “brought
down the house.” But when, a month later (March 23), the Messiah itself
was offered to London even the King, who then established a lasting
custom by rising to his feet at the Hallelujah Chorus, could not lift
the oratorio to acceptance. The clergy condemned the use of a theater
for religious music; the nobility, still smarting from the failure of
their opera company, stayed away. The Messiah was offered only three
times in the next two years, then not again till 1 749. In that year
Handel, who was a philanthropist between bankruptcies, presented a
handsome organ to the foundlings’ hospital so dear to his friend
Hogarth; and on May 1, 1750, he gave the first of many annual
performances of the Messiah for the benefit of those lucky un-
fortunates.</p>
<p>On June 27, 1743, George II led his army to victory at Dettingen.
When he returned to London the city greeted him with parades,
illuminations, and</p>
<p>CHAP. Vi)</p>
<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>M 1</p>
<p>music, and the Chapel Royal in the Palace of St. James resounded with
the “Dettingen Te Deum” that Handel had composed for the occasion (No -
vember 27). It was a product of genius and scissors, for it contained
pas- sages pilfered from earlier and minor composers; but it was a
miracle of agglutination. The King was pleased.</p>
<p>Encouraged by royal smiles, Handel renewed his efforts to recapture
the ear of London. On February 10, 1744, he presented another oratorio,
S emele. It contained the exquisite song “Where’er You Walk,” which Eng
- land and America still sing, but it could not exceed four
performances. The nobles remained hostile; many titled ladies made a
point of entertaining lavishly on the evenings scheduled for a concert
by Handel; rowdies were hired to tear down his advertisements. On April
23, 1745, he canceled the eight concerts that he had announced; he
closed his theater, and retired to Tunbridge Wells. Rumor had it that he
was insane. “Poor Hendel,” wrote the current Earl of Shaftesbury
(October 24), “looks a little better. I hope he will recover completely,
though his mind has been entirely deranged.” 64</p>
<p>The rumor may have erred, for Handel, now sixty years old, responded
with all his powers to an invitation from the Prince of Wales to
commemo- rate the victory of the Prince’s younger brother, the Duke of
Cumberland, over the Stuart forces at Culloden. Handel took as a
symbolic subject Judas Maccabaeus’ triumph (1 66 -1 61 b.c.) over the
Hellenizing schemes of An- tiochus IV. The new oratorio was so well
received (April 1, 1747) that it bore five repetitions in its first
season. The Jews of London, grateful to see one of their national heroes
so nobly celebrated, helped to swell the attendance, enabling Handel to
present the oratorio forty times before his death. Grateful for this new
support, he took most of his oratorio subjects henceforth from Jewish
legend or history: Alexander Balus, Joshua, Su- sanna, Solomon, Jephtha.
By contrast Theodora, a Christian theme, drew so small an audience that
Handel ruefully remarked, “There was room enough to dance.” Chesterfield
left before the conclusion, excusing himself on the ground that he “did
not wish to disturb the King in his privacy.” 85</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">

</ol>
<p>The oratorios are but one species of the genus Handel. His polymor-
phous spirit turned with almost spontaneous accord to any of a dozen
musi- cal forms. Songs that still touch the chords of sentiment,
keyboard pieces of exquisite delicacy, sonatas, suites, quartets,
concertos, operas, oratorios, ballet music, odes, pastorals, cantatas,
hymns, anthems, Te Deums, Passions — almost everything but the nascent
symphony is there, rivaling the profuse immensity of Beethoven or Bach.
The Suites de Pieces pour le Clavecin</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>sound today, on the harpsichord, like the voices of happy children
still un- acquainted with history. A second set of suites began with
that prelude which Brahms frolicked with in “Variations and Fugue on a
Theme of Handel.”</p>
<p>Just as he had taken the oratorio from Carissimi and Keiser and
brought it to its peak, so Handel took from Torelli and Corelli the
concerto grosso — for two or more solo or duo instruments with a chamber
orchestra. In Opus 6 he left twelve such concerti grossi, pitting two
violins and a violon- cello against an ensemble of strings; some of them
strike us as monotonous today, some come close to Bach’s Brandenburg
Concertos. There are also, in Handel, delightful concertos for a single
solo instrument — harpsichord, organ, violin, viola, oboe, or harp.
Those for keyboards were performed by Handel himself in preludes or
interludes. Sometimes he left place in the concerto scores for what we
should now call a cadenza, wherein the per- former could free his
imagination and display his skill. Handel’s improvisa - tions in such
openings were the wonder of many days.</p>
<p>In July, 1717, George I arranged a royal “progress” in decorated
barges on the Thames. The Daily Courant of July 19, 1717, reveals the
scene:</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening at about eight the King took water at</p>
<p>Whitehall in an open barge, wherein were also the Duchess of New-
castle, the Countess of Godolphin, Madam Kilmanseck, and the Earl of
Orkney, and went up the river towards Chelsea. Many other barges</p>
<p>with persons of quality attended, and so great a number of boats that
the whole river in a man ner was covered. A city company’s barge was
employed for the music, wherein were fifty instruments of all sorts, who
played all the way from Lambeth… the finest symphonies,</p>
<p>composed express for the occasion by Mr. Hendel, which his Majesty
liked so well that he caused it to be played over three times in going
and returning. 66</p>
<p>This is the Water Music that is today the hardiest and most pleasant
sur- vivor of Handel’s instrumental compositions. Apparently there were
origi - nally twenty-one movements — too many for modern auditors
lacking barges and hours; generally we hear only six. Some are a bit
tiresome in their melodious wandering; but most of them are healthy,
joyous, sparkling music, as if flowing from a fountain to make a lullaby
for royal mistresses. The Water Music is the oldest piece in today’s
orchestral repertoire.</p>
<p>A full generation later, for a second George, Handel dignified
another outdoor occasion. To celebrate the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the
govern- ment arranged a display of fireworks in the Green Park, and
commissioned Handel to write the Royal Fireworks Music. When this was
rehearsed in Vauxhall Gardens (April 21, 1749) twelve thousand persons
paid the then</p>

<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>M3</p>
<p>considerable sum of two shillings each to hear it; so great was the
conges- tion that traffic on the approach over London Bridge was held up
for three hours — “probably the most stupendous tribute any composer
ever re - ceived.” 67 On April 27 half of London pushed its way into the
Green Park; sixteen yards of its wall had to be torn down to let them
enter in time. A “band” of a hundred musicians played Handel’s music,
and fireworks sparkled in the sky. A building erected for the occasion
caught fire; the crowd panicked; many persons were injured; two died.
All that remained of the festivity was Handel’s music. Designed to
commemorate a victorious war and to be heard at a distance, it is a
blare of bravos and a din of drums, too noisy for an adagio ear; but one
largo movement falls gratefully upon tired nerves.</p>
<p>England at last came to love the old German who had striven so hard
to be an Englishman. He had failed, but he had tried, even to swearing
in English. London had learned to forgive his massive corpulence, his
broad face and swelling cheeks, his bow legs and heavy gait, his velvet
scarlet greatcoat, his gold-knobbed cane, his proud and haughty air;
after all his battles this man had the right to look like a conqueror,
or at least a lord. His manners were rough, he disciplined his musicians
with love and rage; he scolded his audience for talking at rehearsals;
he threatened divas with violence. But he muffled his guns with humor.
When Cuzzoni and Bordoni took to fisticuffs on the stage, he said
calmly, “Let them fight it out”; and</p>
<p>In 1752 he began to lose his eyesight. While he was writing Jephtha
his vision became so blurred that he had to stop. On the autograph
manuscript in the British Museum are strange irregularities — “stems
placed at some distance from the notes to which they belonged, and notes
which had obviously lost their way.” 70 At the foot of the page appears
a line by the composer: “Have got so far, Wednesday , 13th February.
Prevented from continuing because of my left eye.” Ten days later he
wrote on the margin: “The 23rd February, am a little better. Resumed
work.” Then he com - posed the music for the words “Our joy is lost in
grief,… as day is lost in night.” 71 On November 4 The General
Advertiser reported: “Yesterday George Frederic Hendel, Esq., was
couched [for cataract] by Wm. Brom- field, Esq., surgeon to her Royal
Highness the Princess of Wales.” The operation seemed successful, but on
January 27, 1753, a London newspaper</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>2 44</p>
<p>announced that “Mr. Hendel has at length, unhappily, quite lost his
sight.” Later reports indicate that he retained some vestiges of vision
till his death.</p>
<p>He continued composing and conducting for seven years more. In six
weeks (February 23 to April 6, 1759) he gave two performances of Solo-
mon, one of Samson, two of Judas Maccabaeus, three of the Messiah. But
on leaving the theater after the Messiah of April 6 he fainted, and had
to be carried to his home. Regaining consciousness, he asked for one
more week of life; “I want to die on Good Friday, in the hope of
rejoining the good God, my sweet Lord and Saviour, on the day of His
Resurrection.” 72 He added to his will a codicil bequeathing a thousand
pounds to the Society for the Support of Decayed Musicians and Their
Families, and substantial bequests to thirteen friends, and “to my
maidservants each one year’s wages.” He died on Holy Saturday, Apr il
14, 1759. He was buried in</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey on April 20, before “the greatest Concourse of
People of all Ranks ever seen upon such or indeed upon any other
Occasion.” 73</p>
<p>He left an unparalleled quantity of music: forty-six operas,
thirty-two oratorios, seventy overtures, seventy-one cantatas,
twenty-six concerti grossi, eighteen organ concertos, and so much else
that the whole fills a hundred bulky volumes, almost equaling the works
of Bach and Beethoven combined. Some of it was repetition, and some of
it was theft, for Handel plagiarized, without acknowledgment, from at
least twenty-nine authors to help him meet a deadline; 74 so the minuet
in the overture to Samson was taken, so to say, notatim from Reiser’s
opera Claudius. 15</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate Handel, for only a small part of his
oeuvre is offered to us today. The operas, except for some captivating
arias, are be- yond resurrection; they were adjusted to Italian modes
that seem irrevoca- bly gone; their extant scores are incomplete, and
use symbols and abbrevia- tions now largely unintelligible; they were
written for orchestras of quite other constitution than ours, and for
voices of a third sex quite different from the intermediate sexes of our
time. The concertos remain, a happy hunting ground of forgotten
treasures, and the Water Music, and the ora- torios. But even the
oratorios are “dated,” having been written for embat - tled Englishmen
and grateful Jews; those massive choruses and proliferated vowels
require a musicological stomach for their digestion — though we should
be glad to hear Jephtha and Israel in Egypt again. Musicians tell us
that in the neglected oratorios there is a solemn grandeur, a sublimity
of feeling, a power of conception, expression, and drama, a variety and
skill in compositional technique, never again reached in the literature
of that form. The Messiah survives its repetitions and dismemberments
partly be- cause it enshrines the central doctrines of Christianity,
dear even to those who have shed them, but chiefly because its profound
chants and triumphal</p>

<p>choruses make it, all in all, the greatest single composition in the
history of music.</p>
<p>England realized his greatness when he was gone. As the anniversary
of his birth approached, the nobility, once hostile, joined with King
and com- moners to commemorate it with three days of his music. As his
birth had fallen in 1684 by the English calendar, the first performance
was given on May 26, 1784, in Westminster Abbey; the second and third on
May 27 and</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>These having failed to meet the demand, two more were given in the
Abbey on June 3 and 5. The singers numbered 274, the orchestra 251; now
began the custom of making Handel overwhelmingly monumental. Similar
immensities celebrated later Handel anniversaries, until in 1874 the
number of performers swelled to 3,500. Burney, who heard one of these
enormi- ties, thought that the quantity of sound had not injured the
quality of the music. 76 In any case these were the most massive
commemorations that any musician has ever received. Now that they have
subsided it may be possible to hear Handel’s music again.</li>

<p>V. VOLTAIRE IN ENGLAND: 1 726-28</p>
<p>There was a young Frenchman, in the England of 1726, who was to</p>
<p>prove far more important than Handel in the history of the eighteenth
cen- tury. Voltaire touched English shores at Greenwich, near London, on
May 10 or 11. His first impression was enthusiastic. It was the week of
the Greenwich Fair; the Thames was almost covered with boats and stately
sails; the King was coming downstream in a decorated barge, preceded by
a band. On shore men and women moved proudly on prancing horses; on foot
were scores of pretty girls, dressed for a holiday. Voltaire,
thirty-two, was stirred by their graceful figures, demure modesty, and
rosy cheeks. He forgot them when he reached London and found that the
banker on whose funds he had a letter of exchange for twenty thousand
francs had declared bankruptcy. He was rescued by Everard Falkener, a
merchant whom he had met in France; for some months he stayed at this
generous Briton’s estate at Wandsworth, a suburb of London. George I,
hearing of Voltaire’s contretemps, sent him a hundred guineas.</p>
<p>He had letters of introduction from Horatio Walpole, British
ambassador to France, to many celebrities; sooner or later he met nearly
everyone of any prominence in English letters or politics. He was
received by Robert Walpole, prime minister; by the Duke of Newcastle; by
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough; by George Augustus and Caroline, Prince
and Princess of Wales; and finally by the King, who gave him a valuable
watch, which</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VI</p>
<p>V oltaire sent as a peace offering to his father. He visited “mylord
and my - lady Bolingbroke,” and “found their affection still the same.”
77 In August he made a flying trip to France, still eager to fight
Rohan, but probably to regulate his financial affairs. For three months
he lived — part of the time with Swift — as guest of the third Earl of
Peterborough. For another three months he enjoyed at Eastbury Manor the
hospitality of Bubb Dodington, corrupt politician but kindly Maecenas to
Fielding, Thomson, and Young. Voltaire met the two poets there, and read
them with no profit. He set himself resolutely to learn the language; by
the end of 1726 he was writing letters in English. 78 For the first
months he confined himself to circles where French was understood; but
nearly all men and women of consequence in English letters or politics
knew French. The notebooks that he now filled were written in either
language, and show that he learned the wicked words He developed such an
acquaintance with English literature as no French- man of note acquired
again till Hippolyte Taine. He read Bolingbroke, but found the
Viscount’s pen less brilliant than his tongue; however, he may have
taken from Bolingbroke’s Idea of a Patriot King the belief that the best
chance of social reform would be through an enlightened monarchy. He
made his way through Swift’s distilled hatreds, learned from him, per -
haps, some arts of satire, and pronounced him “infinitely superior to
Rabe - lais.” 79 He read Milton, and pounced at once upon the fact that
Satan was the real hero of Paradise Lost. 80 We have seen elsewhere his
confused reac- tion to Shakespeare — admiration of the “amiable
barbarian’s” eloquence , “pearls” of sublimity or tenderness in an
“enormous dunghill” of farces and vulgarities. 81 He imitated Julius
Caesar in La Mort de Cesar, and Othello in Zaire. So Gulliver’s Travels
reappeared in Micr omegas, and Pope’s Essay on Man in the Biscours en
vers sur I’homme.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival in England he went to see Pope. He was shocked
by Pope’s deformity and sufferings, amazed by Pope’s sharpness of mind
and phrase; he rated Pope’s Essay on Criticism above Boileau’s Art po -
etique. 82 He visited the aging Congreve, and was piqued to find that
the once great dramatist wished to be considered “not as an author but
as a gentleman.” 83 He learned with envy of the sinecures and pensions
given to authors by English ministries b efore Walpole’s, and contrasted
this with the fate of France’s leading poet, thrown into the Bastille
for resenting a nobleman’s slur.</p>
<p>From literature he passed to science, met members of the Royal
Society, and began that study of Newton which would enable him later to
replace Descartes with Newton in France. He was deeply impressed by the
cere- monial funeral given to Newton by the elite of England, and noted
how the Anglican clergy welcomed a scientist into Westminster Abbey.
Though</p>

<p>ART AND MUSIC</p>
<p>M7</p>
<p>he had become a deist before visiting England — had learned the art
of doubt from Rabelais, Montaigne, Gassendi, Fontenelle, and Bayle — he
now de- rived corroboration from the deists of England — Toland,
Woolston, Tin dal, Chubb, Collins, Middleton, and Bolingbroke; later his
library would be armed with their books. Stronger still was the
influence of Locke, whom Voltaire praised as the first to make a
realistic study of the mind. He ob- served that very few of these
insistent heretics had been imprisoned for their views; he remarked the
growth of religious toleration since 1689; he thought there was no
religious bigotry or fanaticism in England; even the Quakers had
subsided into comfortable businessmen. He visited one of them, and was
pleased to be told that Pennsylvania was a utopia without classes, wars,
or enemies. 84</p>
<p>“How I love the English!” he later wrote to Mme. du Deffand. “How I
love these people who say what they think!” 85 And again:</p>
<p>See what the laws of England have achieved: they have restored to</p>
<p>every man his natural rights, from which nearly all monarchies have
despoiled him. These rights are: full freedom of person and property; to
speak to the nation through his pen; to be judged in criminal matters by
a jury of free men; to be judged in any matter only according to</p>
<p>precise laws; to profess in peace whatever religion he prefers, while
abstaining from those employments to which only members of the</p>
<p>Anglican Church are eligible. 86</p>
<p>The last line shows that Voltaire recognized the limits of English
freedom. He knew that religious liberty was far from complete; and in
his notebooks he recorded the arrest of “Mr. Shipping” for derogatory
remarks on the King’s speech. 87 Either house of Parli ament could
summon authors to trial for unpleasant statements about M.P.S; the lord
chamberlain could refuse to license plays; Defoe had been pilloried for
a sarcastic pamphlet. Never- theless, Voltaire felt, the government of
England, corrupt as it was, gave the people a degree of liberty
creatively stimulating in every area of life.</p>
<p>Here, for example, commerce was relatively free, not shackled by such
internal tolls as hobbled it in France. Businessmen were honored with
high posts in the administration; friend Falkener was soon to be made
ambassa- dor to Turkey. Voltaire the businessman liked the practicality
of the Eng- lish, their respect for facts, reality, utility, their
simplicity of manners, habits, and dress even in opulence. Above all he
liked the English middle class. He compared the English with their beer:
froth at the top, dregs at the bottom, but the middle excellent. 88 “If
I were to follow my inclination,” he wr ote on August 12, 1726, “I would
stay right here, for the sole purpose of learning to think”; and in a
burst of enthusiasm he invited Thieriot to</p>
<p>24^ THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. VI</p>
<p>visit “a nation fond of their liberty, learned, witty, despising life
and death, a nation of philosophers.” 89</p>
<p>This love affair with England was clouded for a while by the
suspicion, in Pope and others, that Voltaire was acting as a spy on his
Tory friends for the Walpole ministry. 90 The suspicion proved unjust
and was soon re- jected, and Voltaire won considerable popularity among
the aristocracy, and the intelligentsia of London. When he decided to
publish La Henriade in England, nearly all literate circles, beginning
with George I, Princess Caroline, and the rival courts, sent in
subscriptions; Swift solicited, or com- manded, a number of these. When
the poem appeared (1728) it was dedi- cated to Caroline, now Queen, with
an incidental bouquet to George II, who responded with a gift of four
hundred pounds and an invitation to royal suppers. Three editions were
sold out in three weeks, despite the princely price of three guineas per
copy; from this English edition Voltaire estimated his receipts at 1
50,000 francs. He used part of the money to help several Frenchmen in
England; 91 the remainder he invested so wisely that he later judged
this windfall to have been the origin of his wealth. He never ceased to
be grateful to England.</p>
<p>He owed to it, above all, an immense stimulation of mind and maturing
of thought. When he returned from exile he brought Newton and Locke in
his baggage; he spent part of his next twenty years introducing them to
France. He brought also the English deists, who supplied him with some
of the ammunition that he was to use in his war against I’infame. As
England under Charles II had learned good and evil from the France of
Louis XIV, so the France of Louis XV was to learn from the England of
1680-1760. Nor was Voltaire the only medium of exchange in this
generation; Mon- tesquieu, Maupertuis, Prevost, Buffon, Raynal,
Morellet, Lalande, Helve- tius, Rousseau also came to England; and
others who did not come learned enough English to become carriers of
English ideas. Voltaire later summed up the debt in a letter to
Helvetius:</p>
<p>We have borrowed, from the English, annuities,… sinking funds,</p>
<p>he construction and maneuvering of ships, the laws of
gravitation,</p>
<p>… the seven primary colors, and inoculation. Imperceptibly we shall
acquire from them their noble freedom of thought, and their profound
contempt for the petty trifling of the schools. 92</p>
<p>Nevertheless he was lonesome for France. England was ale, but France
was wine. He repeatedly begged permission to return. Apparently it was
granted on the mild condition that he avoid Paris for forty days. We do
not know when he left England; probably in the fall of 1728. In March,
1729, he was in St.-Germain-en-Laye; on April 9 he was in Paris,
chastened but indestructible, bursting with ideas, and itching to
transform the world.</p>
