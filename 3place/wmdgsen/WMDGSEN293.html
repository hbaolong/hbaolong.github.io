<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XThe Sword of Islam</p>
<p>632-1058</p>
<p>I. THE SUCCESSORS: 632-60</p>
<p>M OHAMMED had appointed no successor to his power, but he had chosen
Abu Bekr (573-624) to conduct the prayers in the Medina</p>
<p>mosque; and after some turmoil and rivalry this mark of preference
per- suaded the Moslem leaders to elect Abu Bekr the first Caliph of
Islam. Khalifa (“representative”) was at first a designation rather than
a title; the official title was amir al- mumimn, “Commander of the
Faithful.” Ali, cousin and son - in-law of Mohammed, was disappointed by
the choice, and for six months withheld allegiance. Abbas, uncle of both
Ali and Mohammed, shared this resentment. From this inaugural
disagreement came a dozen wars, an Abbasid dynasty, and a sectarian
division that still agitates the Moslem world.</p>
<p>Abu Bekr was now fifty-nine; short, thin, and strong, with scanty
hair, and white beard dyed red; simple and abstemious, kindly but
resolute; attending personally to details of administration and
judgment, and never resting till justice was done; serving without pay
till his people overruled his austerity; and then, in his will,
returning to the new state the stipends it had paid him. The tribes of
Arabia mistook his modest manners for weakness of will; only
superficially and reluctantly converted to Islam, they now ignored it,
and refused to pay the tithes that Mohammed had laid upon them. When Abu
Bekr insisted, they marched upon Medina. The Caliph improvised an army
overnight, led it out before dawn, and routed the rebels (632)..Khalid
ibn al-Walid, the most brilliant and ruthless of Arab generals, was sent
out to bring back the turbulent peninsula to orthodoxy, repentance, and
tithes.</p>
<p>This internal dissension may have formed one of the many conditions
that led to the Arab conquest of western Asia. No thought of so extended
an en- terprise seems to have occurred to the Moslem leaders at Abu
Bekr’s acces - sion. Some Arab tribes in Syria rejected Christianity and
Byzantium, stood off the imperial armies, and asked for Moslem help. Abu
Bekr sent them reinforcements, and encouraged anti-Byzantine sentiment
in Arabia; here was an external issue that might weld internal unity.
The Bedouins, tired of starvation and used to war, enlisted readily in
these apparently limited campaigns; and before they realized it the
skeptics of the desert were dying enthusiastically for Islam.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>1 88</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XMany causes produced the Arab expansion. There were economic causes:
the decline of orderly government in the century before Mohammed had
allowed the irrigation system of Arabia to decay; 1 the lowered yield of
the soil menaced the growing population; hunger for arable land may have
moved the Moslem regiments. 2 Political causes operated: both Byzantium
and Persia, exhausted by war and mutual devastation, were in a tempting
decline; in their provinces taxation rose while administration lapsed
and protection failed. Racial affinities played a part: Syria and
Mesopotamia contained Arab tribes that found no difficulty in accepting
first the rule, then the faith, of the Arab invaders. Religious
considerations entered: Byzantine oppression of Monophysites,
Nestorians, and other sects had alienated a large minority of the Syrian
and Egyptian population, even some of the imperial garri- sons. As the
conquest proceeded, the role of religion mounted; the Moslem leaders
were passionate disciples of Mohammed, prayed even more than they
fought, and in time inspired their followers with a fanaticism that
accepted death in a holy war as an open sesame to paradise. Morale
factors were in- volved: Christian ethics and monasticism had reduced in
the Near East that readiness for war which characterized Arab custom and
Moslem teaching. The Arab troops were more rigorously disciplined and
more ably led; they were inured to hardship and rewarded with spoils;
they could fight on empty stomachs, and depended upon victory for their
meals. But they were not bar- barians. “Be just,” ran Abu Bekr’s
proclamation; “be valia nt; die rather than yield; be merciful; slay
neither old men, nor women, nor children. Destroy no fruit trees, grain,
or cattle. Keep your word, even to your enemies. Molest not those
religious persons who live retired from the world, but compel the •r est
of mankind to become Moslems or pay us tribute. If they refuse these
terms, slay them.” 3 The choice given the enemy was not Islam or the
sword; it was Islam or tribute or the sword. Finally, there were
military causes of the invasion: as the triumphant Arab armies swelled
with hungry or ambi- tious recruits, the problem arose of giving them
new lands to conquer, if only to provide them with food and pay. The
advance created its own momentum; each victory required another, until
the Arab conquests — more rapid than the Roman, 1 more lasting than the
Mongol — summed up to the most amazing feat in military history.</p>
<p>Early in 633 Khalid, having “pacified” Arabia, was invited by a nomad
frontier tribe to join it in raiding a neighboring community across the
border in Iraq. Restless in idleness or peace, Khalid and 500 of his men
accepted the invitation, and in conjunction with 2500 tribesmen invaded
Persian soil. We do not know if this adventure had received the consent
of Abu Bekr; apparently he accepted the results philosophically. Khalid
captured Hira, and sent the Caliph enough booty to elicit from him the
famous phrase: “Surely the womb is exhausted. Woman will no more bear a
Khalid!” 4 Woman had now become a substantial item in the thought and
spoils of the</p>
<p>CHAP. X) THE SWORD OF ISLAM 1 89</p>
<p>victors. At the siege of Emesa a young Arab leader fired the zeal of
his troops by describing the beauty of the Syrian girls. When Hira
surrendered, Khalid stipulated that a lady, Kermat, should be given to
an Arab soldier who claimed that Mohammed had promised her to him. The
lady’s family mourned, but Kermat took the matter lightly. “The fool saw
me in my youth,” she said, “and has forgotten that youth does not last
forever.” The soldier, seeing her, agreed, and freed her for a little
gold. 5</p>
<p>Before Khalid could enjoy his victory at Hira a message came to him
from the Caliph, sending him to the rescue of an Arab force threatened
by an over- whelmingly superior Greek army near Damascus. Between Hira
and Damas- cus lay five days’ march of waterless desert. Khalid gathered
camels, and made them drink plentifully; en route the soldiers drew
water from slain camels’ bellies, and fed their horses on camels’ milk.
This commissary was exhausted when Khalid’s troops reached the main Arab
army on the Yarmuk River sixty miles southwest of Damascus. There, say
the Moslem historians, 40,000 (25,000?) Arabs defeated 240,000 (50,000?)
Greeks in one of the innumerable decisive battles of history (634). The
Emperor Heraclius had risked all Syria on one engagement; henceforth
Syria was to be the base of a spreading Moslem empire.</p>
<p>While Khalid was leading his men to victory a dispatch informed him
that Abu Bekr had died (634), and that the new caliph, Omar, wished him
to yield his command to Abu Obeida; Khalid concealed the message till
the battle was won. Omar (Umar Abu Hafsa ibn al-Khattab) (582-644) had
been the chief adviser and support of Abu Bekr, and had earned such
repute that no one protested when the dying Caliph named him as
successor. Yet Omar was the very opposite of his friend: tall,
broad-shouldered, and passionate; agreeing with him only in frugal
simplicity, bald head, and dyed beard. Time and responsibility had
matured him into a rare mixture of hot temper and cool judgment. Having
beaten a Bedouin unjustly, he begged the Bedouin — in vain — to inflict
an equal number of strokes upon him. He was a severe puritan, demanding
strict virtue of every Moslem; he carried about with him a whip
wherewith he beat any Mohammedan whom he caught infringing the Ko- ranic
code.® Tradition reports that he scourged his son to death for repeated
drunkenness. 7 Moslem historians tell us that he owned but one shirt and
one mantle, patched and repatched; that he lived on barley bread and
dates, and drank nothing but water; that he slept on a bed of palm
leaves, hardly better than a hair shirt; and that his sole concern was
the propagation of the faith by letters and by arms. When a Persian
satrap came to pay homage to Omar he found the conqueror of the East
asleep among beggars on the steps of the Medina mosque. 8 We cannot
vouch for the truth of these tales.</p>
<p>Omar had deposed Khalid because the “Sword of God” had repeatedly</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xposal of Abu Obeida, who had the wisdom to follow his advice in
strategy and oppose his ferocity in victory. The Arabs, ever skillful
horsemen, proved superior to the cavalry, as well as the infantry, of
the Persians and the Greeks; nothing in early medieval armament could
withstand their weird battle cries, their bewildering maneuvers, their
speed; and they took care to choose level battle grounds favorable to
the tactical movements of their mounts. In 635 Damascus was taken, in
636 Antioch, in 638 Jerusalem; by 640 all Syria was in Moslem hands; by
641 Persia and Egypt were conquered. The Patriarch Sophronius agreed to
surrender Jerusalem if the Caliph would come in person to ratify the
terms of capitulation. Omar consented, and traveled from Me- dina in
stately simplicity, armed with a sack of corn, a bag of dates, a gourd
of water, and a wooden dish. Khalid, Abu Obeida, and other leaders of
the Arab army went out to welcome him. He was displeased by the finery
of their raiment and the ornate trappings of their steeds; he flung a
handful of gravel upon them, crying : “Begone! Is it thus attired that
ye come out to meet me?” He received Sophronius with kindness and
courtesy, imposed an easy tribute on the vanquished, and confirmed the
Christians in the peace- ful possession of all their shrines. Christian
historians relate that he accom- panied the Patriarch in a tour of
Jerusalem. During his ten days’ stay he chose the site for the mosque
that was to be known by his name. Then, learning that the people of
Medina were fretting lest he make Jerusalem the citadel of Islam, he
returned to his modest capital.</p>
<p>Once Syria and Persia were securely held, a wave of migration set in
from Arabia to north and east, comparable to the migration of Germanic
tribes into the conquered provinces of Rome. Women joined in the
movement, but not in numbers adequate to Arab zeal; the conquering males
rounded out their harems with Christian and Jewish concubines, and
reckoned the chil- dren of such unions legitimate. By such industry and
reckoning the “Arabs” in Syria and Persia were half a million by 644.
Omar forbade the conquerors to buy or till land; he hoped that outside
of Arabia they would remain a military caste, amply supported by the
state, but vigorously preserving their martial qualities. His
prohibitions were ignored after his death, and almost nullified by his
generosity in life; he divided the spoils of victory eighty per cent to
the army, twenty per cent to the nation. The minority of men, having the
majority of brains, soon gathered in the majority of goods in this
rapidly growing Arab wealth. The Quraish nobles built rich palaces in
Mecca and Medina; Zobeir had palaces in several cities, with 1000 horses
and 10,000 slaves; Abd-er-Rahman had 1000 camels, 10,000 sheep, 400,000
dinars (,912,000). Omar saw with sorrow the decline of his people into
luxury.</p>
<p>A Persian slave struck him down while Omar led the prayers in the
mosque (644). Unable to persuade Abd-er-Rahman to succeed him, the dying
Ca- liph appointed six men to choose his successor. They named the
weakest of their number, perhaps in the hope that they would rule him.
Othman ibn</p>
<p>CHAP, x) THE SWORD OF ISLAM 191</p>
<p>Affan was an old man of kindly intent; he rebuilt and beautified the
Medina mosque, and supported the generals who now spread Moslem arms to
Herat and Kabul, Balkh and Tiflis, and through Asia Minor to the Black
Sea. But it was his misfortune to be a loyal member of that aristocratic
Umayyad clan which in early days had been among Mohammed’s proudest
foes. The Umayyads flocked to Medina to enjoy the fruits of their
relationship to the old Caliph. He could not refuse their importunity;
soon a dozen lucrative offices warmed the hands of men who scorned the
puritanism and simplicity of pious Moslems. Islam, relaxing in victory,
divided into ferocious factions: “Refugees” from Mecca vs. “Helpers”
from Medina; the ruling cities of Mecca and Medina vs. the fast-growing
Moslem cities of Damascus, Kufa, and Basra; the Quraish aristocracy
vs. the Bedouin democracy; the Prophet’s Hashimite clan led by Ali
vs. the Umayyad clan led by Muawiya — son of Mohammed’s chief enemy Abu
Sufyan, but now governor of Syria. In 654 a converted Jew began to
preach a revolutionary doctrine at Basra: that Mo- hammed would return
to life, that Ali was his only legitimate successor, that Othman was a
usurper and his appointees a set of godless tyrants. Driven from Basra,
the rebel went to Kufa; driven from Kufa, he fled to Egypt, where his
preaching found passionate audience. Five hundred Egyptian Mos- lems
made their way to Medina as pilgrims, and demanded Othman’s resig -
nation. Refused, they blockaded him in his palace. Finally they stormed
into his room and killed him as he sat reading the Koran (656) .</p>
<p>The Umayyad leaders fled from Medina, and the Hashimite faction at
last raised Ali to the caliphate. He had been in his youth a model of
modest piety and energetic loyalty; he was now fifty-five, bald and
stout, genial and chari- table, meditative and reserved; he shrank from
a drama in which religion had been displaced by politics, and devotion
by intrigue. He was asked to punish Othman’s assassins, but delayed till
they escaped. He called for the resig - nation of Othman’s appointees;
most of them refused; instead of resigning, Muawiya exhibited in
Damascus the bloody garments of Othman, and the fingers that Othman’s
wife had lost in trying to shield him. The Quraish clan, dominated by
the Umayyads, rallied to Muawiya; Zobeir and Talha, “Companions” of the
Prophet, revolted against Ali , and laid rival claims to the caliphate.
Aisha, proud widow of Mohammed, left Medina for Mecca, and joined in the
revolt. When the Moslems of Basra declared for the rebels, Ali appealed
to the veterans at Kufa, and promised to make Kufa his capital if they
would come to his aid. They came; the two armies met at Khoraiba in
southern Iraq in the Battle of the Camel — called so because Aisha com-
manded her troops from her camel seat. Zobeir and Talha were defeated
and killed; Aisha was escorted with all courtesy to her home in Medina;
and Ali transferred his government to Kufa, near the ancient
Babylon.</p>
<p>But in Damascus Muawiya raised another rebel force. He was a man of
the world, who privately put little stock in Mohammed’s revelation;
religion</p>
<p>192 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xseemed to him an economical substitute for policemen, but no
aristocrat would let it interfere with his enjoyment of the world. In
effect his war against Ali sought to restore the Quraish oligarchy to
the power and leader- ship that had been taken from them by Mohammed.
Ali’s reorganized forces met Muawiya’s army at Siffin on the Euphrates
(657); Ali was prevailing when Muawiya’s general Amr ibn al -As raised
copies of the Koran on the points of his soldiers’ lances, and demanded
arbitration “according to the word of Allah”— presumably by rules laid
down in the sacred book. Yielding to the insistence of his troops, Ali
agreed; arbitrators were chosen, and were allowed six months to decide
the issue, while the armies returned to their homes.</p>
<p>Part of Ali’s men now turned against him, and formed a separate army
and sect as Khariji or Seceders; they argued that the caliph should be
elected and removable by the people; some of them were religious
anarchists who re- jected all government except that of God; 9 all of
them denounced the world- liness and luxury of the new ruling classes in
Islam. Ali tried to win them back by suasion, but failed; their piety
became fanaticism, and issued in acts of disorder and violence; finally
Ali declared war upon them and suppressed them. In due time the
arbitrators agreed that both Ali and Muawiya should withdraw their
claims to the caliphate. Ali’s representative announced the deposition
of Ali; Amr, however, instead of making a similar withdrawal for
Muawiya, proclaimed him Caliph. Amid this chaos a Kharijite came upon
Ali near Kufa, and pierced his brain with a poisoned sword (68 1 ) . The
spot where Ali died became a holy place to the Shia sect, which
worshiped him as the Wali or vicar of Allah, and made his grave a goal
of pilgrimage as sacred as Mecca itself.</p>
<p>The Moslems of Iraq chose Ali’s son Hasan to succeed him; Muawiya
marched upon Kufa; Hasan submitted, received a pension from Muawiya,
retired to Mecca, married a hundred times, and died at forty-five (669),
poisoned by the Caliph or a jealous wife. Muawiya received the reluctant
allegiance of all Islam; but for his own security, and because Medina
was now too far from the center of Moslem population and power, he made
Damascus his capital. The Quraish aristocracy, through Abu Sufyan’s son,
had won their war against Mohammed; the theocratic “republic” of the
Successors became a secular hereditary monarchy. Semitic rule replaced
the dominance of Persians and Greeks in western Asia, expelled from Asia
a European con- trol that had lasted a thousand years, and gave to the
Near East, Egypt, and North Africa the form that in essence they would
keep for thirteen centuries.</p>

<li>THE UMAYYAD CALIPHATE: 661-750</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us do Muawiya justice. He had won his power first through
appoint- ment as governor of Syria by the virtuous Omar; then by leading
the reaction</p>
<p>THE SWORD OF ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP, x)</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>against the murder of Othman; then by intrigues so subtle that force
had seldom to be used. “I apply not my sword,” he said, “where my lash
suffices, nor my lash where my tongue is enough. And even if there be
one hair bind- ing me to my fellow men I do not let it break; when they
pull I loosen, and if they loos en I pull.” 10 His path to power was
less incarnadined than most of those that have opened new dynasties.</p>
<p>Like other usurpers, he felt the need to hedge his throne with
splendor and ceremony. He took as his model the Byzantine emperors, who
had taken as their model the Persian King of Kings; the persistence of
that monarchical pattern from Cyrus to our time suggests its
serviceability in the government and exploitation of an unlettered
population. Muawiya felt his methods justi- fied by the prosperity that
came under his rule, the quieting of tribal strife, and the
consolidation of Arab power from the Oxus to the Nile. Thinking the
hereditary principle the sole alternative to chaotic struggles for an
elec- tive caliphate, he declared his son Yezid heir apparent, and
exacted an oath of fealty to him from all the realm.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Muawiya died (680), a war of succession repeated
the early history of his reign. The Moslems of Kufa sent word to Husein,
son of Ali, that if he would come to them and make their city his
capital, they would fight for his elevation to the caliphate. Husein set
out from Mecca with his family and seventy devoted followers.
Twenty-five miles north of Kufa the caravan was intercepted by a force
of Yezid’s troops under Obeidallah. Husein offered to submit, but his
band chose to fight. Husein’s nephew Qasim, ten years old, was struck by
one of the first arrows, and died in his uncle’s arms; one by one
Husein’s brothers, sons, cousins, and nephews fell; every man in the
group was killed, while the women and children looked on in horror and
terror. When Husein’s severed head was brought to Obei - dallah he
carelessly turned it over with his staff. “Gently,” one of his officers
protested; “he was the grandson of t he Prophet. By Allah! I have seen
those lips kissed by the blessed mouth of Mohammed!” (680) , n At
Kerbela, where</p>
<p>Abdallah, son of Zobeir, continued the revolt. Yezid’s Syrian troops
de - feated him, and besieged him in Mecca; rocks from their catapults
fell upon the sacred enclosure and split the Black Stone into three
pieces; the Kaaba caught fire, and was burned to the ground (683).
Suddenly the siege was lifted; Yezid had died, and the army was needed
in Damascus. In two years of royal chaos three caliphs held the throne;
finally Abd-al-Malik, son of a cousin of Muawiya, ended the disorder
with ruthless courage, and then gov- erned with relative mildness,
wisdom, and justice. His general Hajjaj ibn Yusuf subdued the Kufans,
and renewed the siege of Mecca. Abdallah, now seventy-two, fought
bravely, urged on by his centenarian mother; he was</p>
<p>THE AGE OF’ FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>Xdefeated and killed; his head was sent as a certified check to
Damascus; his body, after hanging for some time on a gibbet, was
presented to his mother (692). During the ensuing peace Abd-al-Malik
wrote poetry, patronized letters, attended to eight wives, and reared
fifteen sons, of whom four suc- ceeded to his throne; his cognomen meant
Father of Kings.</p>
<p>His reign of twenty years paved the way for the accomplishments of
his son Walid I (705-15). The march of Arab conquest was now resumed:
Balkh was taken in 705, Bokhara in 709, Spain in 7 1 1 , Samarkand in 7
1 2. In the eastern provinces Hajjaj governed with a creative energy
that equaled his barbarities: marshes were drained, arid tracts were
irrigated, and the canal system was restored and improved; not content
with which the general, once a schoolmaster, revolutionized Arabic
orthography by introducing diacrit- ical marks. Walid himself was a
model king, far more interested in adminis- tration than in war. He
encouraged industry and trade with new markets and better roads; built
schools and hospitals — including the first lazar houses known — and
homes for the aged, the crippled, and the blind; enlarged and beautified
the mosques of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, and raised at Da- mascus a
still greater one, which still exists. Amid these labors he composed
verses, wrote music, played the lute, listened patiently to other poets
and musicians, and caroused every second day. 12</p>
<p>His brother and successor Suleiman (715-17) wasted lives and wealth
in a vain attempt upon Constantinople, solaced himself with good food
and bad women, and received the praise of posterity only for bequeathing
his power to his cousin. Omar II (717-20) was resolved to atone in one
reign for all the impiety and liberality of his Umayyad predecessors.
The practice and propagation of the faith were the consuming interests
of his life. He dressed so simply, wore so many patches, that no
stranger took him for a king. He bade his wife surrender to the public
treasury the costly jewels that her father had given her, and she
obeyed. He informed his harem that the duties of government would absorb
him to their neglect, and gave them leave to de- part. He ignored the
poets, orators, and scholars who had depended on the court, but drew to
his counsel and companionship the most devout among the learned in his
realm. He made peace with other countries, withdrew the army that had
besieged Constantinople, and called in the garrisons that had guarded
Moslem cities hostile to Umayyad rule. Whereas his predecessors had
discouraged conversions to Islam on the ground that less poll taxes
would come to the state, Omar speeded the acceptance of Islam by
Christians, Zoro- astrians, and Jews; and when his fiscal agents
complained that his policy was ruining the treasury, he replied: “Glad
would I be, by Allah, to see every - body become Moslem, so that you and
I would have to till the soil with our own hands to earn a l iving.” 13
Clever councilors thought to stay the tide of conversions by requiring
circumcision; Omar, another Paul, bade them dis- pense with it. Upon
those who still refused conversion he laid severe restric-</p>

<p>tions, excluded them from governmental employment, and forbade them
to build new shrines. After a reign of less than three years he sickened
and died. Another side of Moslem character and custom appears in Yezid
II (717-</p>
<p>24), last of the royal sons of Abd-al-Malik. Yezid loved a slave girl
Habiba as Omar II had loved Islam. While still a youth he had bought her
for 4000 pieces of gold; his brother Suleiman, then caliph, had
compelled him to return her to the seller; but Yezid had never forgotten
her beauty and her tender- ness. When he came to power his wife asked
him, “Is there, my love, any - thing in the world left you to desire?”
“Yes,” he said, “Habiba.” The dutiful wife sent for Habiba, presented
her to Yezid, and retired into the obscurity of the harem. One day,
feasting with Habiba, Yezid playfully threw a grape pit into her mouth;
it choked her, and she died in his arms. A week later Yezid died of
grief.</p>
<p>Hisham (724-43) governed the realm for nineteen years in justice and
peace, improved administration, reduced expenses, and left the treasury
full at his death. But the virtues of a saint may be the ruin of a
ruler. Hisham’s armies were repeatedly defeated, rebellion simmered in
the provinces, dis- affection spread in a capital that longed for a
spendthrift king. His successors disgraced a hitherto competent dynasty
by luxurious living and negligent rule. Walid II (743-4) was a skeptic
libertine and candid epicurean. He read with delight the news of his
uncle Hisham’s death; imprisoned Hisham’s son, seized the property of
the late Caliph’s relatives, and emptied the treasury with careless
government and extravagant largesse. His enemies reported that he swam
in a pool of wine and slaked his thirst as he swam; that he used the
Koran as a target for his archery; that he sent his mistresses to
preside in his place at the public prayer. 14 Yezid, son of Walid I,
slew the wastrel, ruled for six months, and died (744). His brother
Ibrahim took the throne but could not defend it; an able general deposed
him, and reigned for six tragic years as Merwan II, the last caliph of
the Umayyad line.</p>
<p>From a worldly point of view the Umayyad caliphs had done well for
Islam. They had extended its political boundaries farther than these
would ever reach again; and, barring some illucid intervals, they had
given the new empire an orderly and liberal government. But the lottery
of hereditary monarchy placed on the throne, in the eighth century,
incompetents who exhausted the treasury, surrendered administration to
eunuchs, and lost control over that Arab individualism which has nearly
always prevented a united Moslem power. The old tribal enmities
persisted as political factions; Hashimites and Umayyads hated one
another as if they were more closely related than they really were.
Arabia, Egypt, and Persia resented the author- ity of Damascus; and the
proud Persians, from contending that they were as good as the Arabs,
passed to claiming superiority, and could no longer brook Syrian rule.
The descendants of Mohammed were scandalized to see at the head of Islam
an Umayyad clan that had included the most unyielding and</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>Xlast converted of the Prophet’s enemies; they were shocked by the
easy mor - als, perhaps by the religious tolerance, of the Umayyad
caliphs; they prayed for the day when Allah would send some savior to
redeem them from this humiliating rule.</p>
<p>All that these hostile forces needed was some initiative personality
to give them unity and voice. Abu al-Abbas, great-great-grandson of an
uncle of Mohammed, provided the leadership from a hiding place in
Palestine, organ- ized the revolt in the provinces, and won the ardent
support of the Shia Persian nationalists. In 749 he proclaimed himself
caliph at Kufa. Merwan II met the rebel forces under Abu al- Abbas’
uncle Abdallah on the river Zab; he was defeated; and a year later
Damascus yielded to siege. Merwan was caught and killed, and his head
was sent to Abu al-Abbas. The new Caliph was not satisfied. “Had they
quaffed my blood,” he said, “it would not have quenched their thirst;
neither is my wrath slaked by this man’s blood.” He named himself
al-Saffah, the Bloodthirsty, and directed that all princes of the
Umayyad line should be hunted out and slain, to forestall any
resurrection of the fallen dynasty. Abdallah, made governor of Syria,
managed the matter with humor and dispatch. He announced an amnesty to
the Umayyads, and to confirm it he invited eighty of their leaders to
dinner. While they ate, his hidden soldiers, at his signal, put them all
to the sword. Carpets were spread over the fallen men, and the feast was
resumed by the Abbasid diners over the bodies of their foes, and to the
music of dying groans. The corpses of several Umayyad caliphs were
exhumed, the almost fleshless skeletons were scourged, hanged, and
burned, and the ashes were scattered to the winds. 15</p>

<p>Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah found himself ruler of an empire extending
from the Indus to the Atlantic: Sind (northwest India), Baluchistan,
Afghani- stan, Turkestan, Persia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria,
Palestine, Cyprus, Crete, Egypt, and North Africa. Moslem Spain,
however, rejected his au- thority, and in the twelfth year of his reign
Sind threw off his rule. Hated in Damascus, uncomfortable in turbulent
Kufa, al-Saffah made Anbar, north of Kufa, his capital. The men who had
helped him to power, and now ad- ministered the state, were
predominantly Persian in origin or culture; after al-Saffah had drunk
his fill of blood, a certain Iranian refinement and urban- ity entered
into the manners of the court; and a succession of enlightened caliphs
dignified the growth of wealth by promoting a brilliant flowering of art
and literature, science and philosophy. After a century of humiliation,
Persia conquered her conquerors.</p>
<p>THE SWORD OF ISLAM</p>
<p>CHAP, x)</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>Al-Saffah died of smallpox in 754. His half brother Abu Jafar
succeeded him under the name of al- Mansur, “the Victorious.” Mansur’s
mother was a Berber slave; of the thirty-seven Abbasid caliphs, slaves
mothered all but three through the institution of concubinage and the
legitimation of its prog- eny; in this way the Moslem aristocracy was
perpetually recruited by the democracy of chance and the fortunes of
love and war. The new Caliph was forty, tall, slender, bearded, dark,
austere; no slave to woman’s beauty, no friend of wine or song, but a
generous patron of letters, sciences, and arts. A man of great ability
and little scruple, by his firm statesmanship he established a dynasty
that might else have died at al- Saffah’s death. He gave himself
sedulously to administration, built a splendid new capital at Baghdad,
reorganized the government and the army into their lasting form, kept a
keen eye on every department and almost every transaction, periodically
forced corrupt officials — including his brother — to disgorge their
peculations into the treasury, and dispensed the funds of the state with
a conscientious parsimony that won him no friends, but the title of
“Father of Farthings.” 16 At the out - set of his reign he established
on a Persian model an institution — the vizierate — which was to play a
major role in Abbasid history. As his first vizier he appointed Khalid,
son of Barmak; this family of Barmakids was cast for a heavy part in the
Abbasid drama. Al-Mansur and Khalid created the order and prosperity
whose full fruits were to fall into the lap of Harun al-Rashid.</p>
<p>After a beneficent reign of twenty-two years al-Mansur died on a
pilgrim- age to Mecca. His son al-Mahdi (775-85) could now afford to be
benevolent. He pardoned all but the most dangerous offenders, spent
lavishly to beautify the cities, supported music and literature, and
administered the empire with reasonable competence. Byzantium having
seized the opportunity of the Abbasid revolution to recover
Arab-conquered territory in Asia Minor, al-Mahdi sent an army under his
son Harun to renew a theft long sanctified by time. Harun drove the
Greeks back to Constantinople, and so threatened that capital that the
Empress Irene made peace on terms that pledged a yearly payment of
70,000 dinars (32,500) to the caliphs (784). From that time onward
al-Mahdi called the youth Harun al-Rashid — Aaron the Upright. He had
previously named another son heir apparent; now, seeing the far su-
perior capacity of Harun, he asked al-Hadi to waive his claim in favor
of his younger brother. Al-Hadi, commanding an army in the east,
refused, and disobeyed a summons to Baghdad; al-Mahdi and Harun set out
to capture him, but al-Mahdi, aged forty-three, died on the way. Harun —
so counseled by the Barmakid Yahya, son of Khalid — recognized Hadi as
Caliph, and him- self as he ir apparent. But, as Sa‘di was to say, “Ten
dervishes can sleep on one rug, but two kings cannot be accommodated in
an entire kingdom.” 17 Al-Hadi soon set Harun aside, imprisoned Yahya,
and proclaimed his own son as successor. Shortly thereafter (786)
al-Hadi died; rumor said that his own mother, favoring Harun, had had
him smothered with pillows. Harun</p>
<p>198 THE AGE OF F^ITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xascended the throne, made Yahya his vizier, and began the most
famous reign in Moslem history.</p>
<p>Legends — above all, the Thousand and One Nights — picture Harun as a
gay and cultured monarch, occasionally despotic and violent, often
generous and humane; so fond of good stories that he had them recorded
in state archives, and rewarded a lady raconteur, now and then, by
sharing his bed with her. 18 All these qualities appear in history
except the gaiety, which perhaps of- fended the historians. These depict
him first of all as a pious and resolutely orthodox Moslem, who severely
restricted the liberties of non-Moslems, made the pilgrimage to Mecca
every second year, and performed a hundred prostrations with his daily
prayers. 19 He drank thirstily, but mostly in the privacy of a few
chosen friends. 20 He had seven wives and several concu- bines; eleven
sons and fourteen daughters, all by slave girls except al-Emin, his son
by the Princess Zobeida. He was generous with all forms of his wealth.
When his son al- Mamun fell in love with one of Harun’s palace maids,
the Caliph presented her to him, merely asking him in payment to compose
some lines of poetry. 21 He enjoyed poetry so intensely that on some
occasions he would overwhelm a poet with extravagant gifts, as when he
gave the poet Merwan, for one brief but laudatory ode, 5000 pieces of
gold (3,750), a robe of honor, ten Greek slave girls, and a favorite
horse. 22 His boon com- panion was the libertine poet Abu Nuwas;
repeatedly angered by the poet’s insolence or open immorality, he was
repeatedly mollified by exquisite verse. He gathered about him in
Baghdad an unparalleled galaxy of poets, jurists, physicians,
grammarians, rhetors, musicians, dancers, artists, and wits; judged
their work with discriminating taste, rewarded them abundantly, and was
repaid by a thousand metrical doxologies. He himself was a poet, a
scholar, an impetuous and eloquent orator. 23 No court in history had
ever a more brilliant constellation of intellects. Contemporary with the
Empress Irene in Constantinople and with Charlemagne in France, and
coming a little later than Tsiian Tsung at Chang-an, Harun excelled them
all in wealth, power, splendor, and the cultural advancement that adorns
a rule.</p>
<p>But he was no dilettante. He shared in the labor of administration,
earned repute as a just judge, and — despite unprecedented liberality
and display- left 48,000,000 dinars (28,000,000) in the treasury at his
death. He led his armies personally in the field, and maintained all
frontiers intact. For the most part, however, he entrusted
administration and policy to the wise Yahya. Soon after his accession he
summoned Yahya and said: “I invest you with the rule over my subjects.
Rule them as you please; depose whom you will, appoint whom you will,
conduct all affairs as yoti see fit”; and in ratification</p>
<p>CHAP, x) THE SWORD OF ISLAM 199</p>
<p>been his tutor, whom he had come to call father, and who had borne
im- prisonment for his sake.</p>
<p>Yahya proved to be one of the ablest administrators in history.
Affable, generous, judicious, tireless, he brought the government to its
highest pitch of efficiency; established order, security, and justice;
built roads, bridges, inns, canals; and kept all the provinces
prosperous even while taxing them severely to fill his master’s purse
and his own; for he, too, like the Caliph, played patron to literature
and art. His sons al-Fadl and Jafar received high office from him,
acquitted themselves well, paid themselves better; they be- came
millionaires, built palaces, kept their own herds of poets, jesters, and
philosophers. Harun loved Jafar so well that gossip found scandal in
their intimacy; the Caliph had a cloak made with two collars, so that he
and Jafar might wear it at the same time, and be two heads with but a
single breast; per- haps in this Siamese garb they sampled together the
night life of Baghdad. 25</p>
<p>We do not know the precise causes that so suddenly ended the
Barmakids’ power. Ibn Khaldun saw the “true cause” in “their assumption
of all author - ity, their jealous disposition of the public revenue, to
such degree that al- Rashid was sometimes reduced to asking for a
trivial sum without being able to obtain it.” 26 As the young ruler grew
into middle age, and found no com - plete expression of his abilities in
the pursuit of sensual pleasure and intel- lectual discourse, he may
have regretted the omnipotence with which he had dowered his vizier.
When he ordered Jafar to have a rebel executed, Jafar connived at the
man’s escape; Harun never forgave this amiable negligence. A story
worthy of the Thousand and One Nights tells how Abbasa, Harun’s sister,
fell in love with Jafar; now Harun had vowed to keep the Hashimite blood
of his sisters as pure as might be of any but high Arabian fluid, and
Jafar was Persian. The Caliph permitted them to marry, but on their
promise never to meet except in his presence. The lovers soon broke this
agreement; Abbasa secretly bore Jafar two sons, who were concealed and
reared in Me- dina. Zobaida, Harun’s wife, discovered the situation and
revealed it to Harun. The Caliph sent for his chief executioner, Mesrur,
bade him kill Ab- basa and bury her in the palace, and supervised in
person the perfprmance of these commands; then he ordered Mesrur to
behead Jafar and bring him the severed head, which was duly done; then
he sent to Medina for the children, talked long with the handsome boys,
admired them, and had them killed (803). Yahya and al-Fadl were
imprisoned; they were allowed to keep their families and servants, but
were never released; Yahya died two years after his son, al-Fadl five
years after his brother. All the property of the Barmakid family,
reputedly amounting to 30,000,000 dinars (42,500,000), was con-
fiscated.</p>
<p>Harun himself did not long survive. For a while he dulled his sorrow
and remorse with work, and welcomed even the toils of war. When
Nicephorus</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XI, Byzantine Emperor, refused to continue the payments pledged by
Irene, and boldly demanded the return of the tribute already paid, Harun
replied: “In the name of Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate. From
Harun, Com- mander of the Faithful, to Nicephorus, dog of a Roman: I
have your letter, O son of an infidel mother. The answer shall be for
your eyes to see, not for your ears to hear. Salaam.” 27 He took the
field at once, and fr om his new and strategic residence at Raqqa, on
the northern frontier, he led into Asia Minor such impetuous expeditions
that Nicephorus soon agreed to resume the trib- ute (806). To
Charlemagne — a useful foil to Byzantium — he sent an embassy bearing
many presents, including a complicated water clock and an ele- phant.
28</p>
<p>Though Harun was now only forty-two, his sons al-Emin and al-Mamun
were already competing for the succession, and looking forward to his
death. Hoping to mitigate their strife, Harun arranged that al-Mamun
should in- herit the provinces east of the Tigris, al-Emin the rest, and
that on the death of either brother the survivor should rule the whole.
The brothers signed this compact, and swore to it before the Kaaba. In
that same year 806 a seri- ous rebellion broke out in Khurasan. Harun
set out with al-Emin and al- Mamun to suppress it, though he was
suffering from severe abdominal pains. At Tus in eastern Iran he could
no longer stand. He was in his last agony when Bashin, a rebel leader,
was brought before him. Made almost insane by pain and grief, Harun
upbraided the captive for causing him to undertake this fatal
expedition, ordered Bashin to be cut to pieces limb by limb, and watched
the execution of the sentence. 29 On the following day Harun the Upright
died (809), aged forty-five.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Decline of the Abbasids</li>
</ol>
<p>Al-Mamun continued to Merv, and came to an agreement with the rebels.
Al-Emin returned to Baghdad, named his infant son heir to his power, de-
manded of al-Mamun three eastern provinces, was denied them, and
declared war. Al- Mamun’s general Tahir defeated the armies of al -Emin,
besieged and almost destroyed Baghdad, and sent al- Emin’s severed head
to al -Mamun after a now inviolable custom. Al-Mamun, still remaining in
Merv, had himself proclaimed Caliph (813). Syria and Arabia continued to
resist him as the son of a Persian slave; and it was not till 8 1 8 that
he entered Baghdad as the acknowledged ruler of Islam.</p>
<p>Abdallah al-Mamun ranks with al-Mansur and al-Rashid as one of the
great caliphs of the Abbasid line. Though capable at times of the fury
and cruelty that had disgraced Harun, he was usually a man of mild and
lenient temper. In his state council he included representatives of all
the major faiths in his realm — Mohammedan, Christian, Jewish, Sabian,
Zoroastrian — and</p>
<p>THE SWORD OF ISLAM</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>CHAP, x)</p>
<p>guaranteed, until his latest years, full freedom of worship and
belief. For a time free thought was de rigueur at the Caliph’s court.
Masudi describes one of al- Mamun’s intellectual afternoons:</p>
<p>Al-Mamun used to hold a salon every Tuesday for the discussion of</p>
<p>questions in theology and law. . . . The learned men of diverse sects
were shown into a chamber spread with carpets. Tables were brought in
laden with food and drink. . . . When the repast was finished, serv-
ants fetched braziers of incense, and the guests perfumed themselves;
then they were admitted to the Caliph. He would debate with them in a
manner as fair and impartial, and as unlike the haughtiness of a
monarch, as can be imagined. At sunset a second meal was served, and the
guests departed to their homes. 30</p>
<p>Under al-Mamun the royal support of arts, sciences, letters, and
philosophy became more varied and discriminating than under Harun, and
left a far more significant result. He sent to Constantinople,
Alexandria, Antioch, and elsewhere for the writings of the Greek
masters, and paid a corps of trans - lators to render the books into
Arabic. He established an academy of science at Baghdad, and
observatories there and at Tadmor, the ancient Palmyra. Physicians,
jurists, musicians, poets, mathematicians, astronomers enjoyed his
bounty; and he himself, like some nineteenth-century mikado, and like
every Moslem gentleman, wrote poetry.</p>
<p>He died too young — at forty eight (833) — and yet too late; for in a
fever of authoritarian liberalism he disgraced his final years by
persecuting ortho- dox belief. His brother and successor, Abu Ishaq
al-Mutassim, shared his good will but not his genius. He surrounded
himself with a bodyguard of 4000 Turkish soldiers, as Roman emperors had
leaned on a Praetorian Guard; and in Baghdad, as in Rome, the guard
became in time and effect the king. The people of the capital complained
that al- Mutassim’s Turks rode reck - lessly through the streets and
committed unpunished crimes. Fearing popular revolt, the Caliph left
Baghdad, and built himself a royal residence some thirty miles north at
Samarra. From 836 to 892 eight caliphs # made it their home and
sepulcher. For twenty miles along the Tigris they reared great pal- aces
and mosques, and their officials built luxurious mansions with murals,
fountains, gardens, and baths. The Caliph al-Mutawakkil affirmed his
piety by spending 700,000 dinars (,325,000) on a vast congregational
mosque, and only a trifle less on a new royal residence, the Jafariya,
with a palace called the “Pearl,” and a “Hall of Delight,” all
surrounded with parks and streams. To find money for these structures
and their trappings al-Mutawak- kil raised taxes and sold public offices
to the highest bidders; and to appease Allah he defended orthodoxy with
persecution. His son persuaded his Turk-</p>

<p>Internal factors corrupted the caliphate before external force
reduced it to subservience. Overindulgence in liquor, lechery, luxury,
and sloth watered down the royal blood, and begot a succession of
weaklings who fled from the tasks of government to the exhausting
delights of the harem. The growth of wealth and ease, of concubinage and
pederasty, had like effects among the ruling class, and relaxed the
martial qualities of the people. There could not come from such
indiscipline the strong hand needed to hold to- gether so scattered and
diverse a conglomeration of provinces and tribes. Racial and territorial
antipathies festered into repeated revolt; Arabs, Per- sians, Syrians,
Berbers, Christians, Jews, and Turks agreed only in despising one
another; and the faith that had once forged unity split into sects that
ex- pressed and intensified political or geographical divisions. The
Near East lives or dies by irrigation; the canals that nourished the
soil needed perpetual protection and care, which no individual or family
could provide; when gov- ernmental maintenance of the canal system
became incompetent or negli- gent, the food supply lagged behind the
birth rate, and starvation had to restore the balance between these
basic factors in history. But the impoverish- ment of the people by
famine or epidemic seldom stayed the hand of the tax- gatherer. Peasant,
craftsman, and merchant saw their gains absorbed into the expenses and
frills of government, and lost the incentive to production, ex- pansion,
or enterprise. At last the economy could not support the govern- ment;
revenues fell;- soldiers could not be adequately paid or controlled.
Turks took the place of Arabs in the armed forces of the state, as
Germans had replaced Romans in the armies of Rome; and from al-Muntasir
onward it was Turkish captains that made and unmade, commanded and
murdered, the caliphs. A succession of sordid and bloody palace
intrigues made the later vicissitudes of the Baghdad caliphate unworthy
of remembrance by history.</p>
<p>The weakening of political diligence and military power at the center
in- vited the dismemberment of the realm. Governors ruled the provinces
with only formal reference to the capital; they schemed to make their
position permanent, at last hereditary. Spain had declared itself
independent in 756, Morocco in 788, Tunis in 801, Egypt in 868; nine
years later the Egyptian emirs seized Syria, and ruled most of it till
1076. Al-Mamun had rewarded his general Tahir by assigning to him and
his descendants the governorship of Khurasan; this Tahirid dynasty
(820-72) ruled most of Persia in semisover- eignty until replaced by the
Saffarids (872-903). In 929-44 a tribe of Shia Moslems, the Hamdanids,
captured northern Mesopotamia and Syria, and dignified their power by
making Mosul and Aleppo brilliant centers of cul- tural life; so Sayfu’l
-Dawla (944-67), himself a poet, made places at his Aleppo court for the
philosopher al-Farabi and the most popular of Arab poets, al-Mutanabbi.
The Buwayhids, sons of the Caspian highland chieftain</p>
<p>CHAP. X) THE SWORD OF ISLAM 203</p>
<p>Buwayh, captured Isfahan and Shiraz, and finally Baghdad (945); for
over a century they forced the caliphs to do their bidding; the
Commander of the Faithful became little more than the head of orthodox
Islam, while the Bu- wayhid emir, a Shi‘ite, assumed direction of the
diminishing state. Adud al - Dawla, the greatest of these Buwayhids
(949-83), made his capital, Shiraz, one of the fairest cities of Islam,
but spent generously also on the other cities of his realm; under him
and his successors Baghdad recaptured some of the glory that it had
known under Harun.</p>
<p>In 874 the descendants of Saman, a Zoroastrian noble, founded a
Samanid dynasty that ruled Transoxiana and Khurasan till 999. We are not
wont to think of Transoxiana as important in the history of science and
philosophy; yet under the Samanid kings Bokhara and Samarkand rivaled
Baghdad as centers of learning and art; there the Persian language was
revived, and be- came the vehicle of a great literature; a Samanid court
gave protection, and the use of a rich library, to Avicenna, the
greatest of medieval philosophers; and al-Razi, greatest of medieval
physicians, dedicated the al-Mcmsuri , his immense summary of medicine,
to a Samanid prince. In 990 the Turks cap- tured Bokhara, and in 999
they put an end to the Samanid dynasty. As the Byzantines for three
centuries had fought to contain the Arab expansion, so now the Moslems
fought to check the westward movement of the Turks; so, later, the Turks
would struggle to stay the Mongol flood. Periodically the pressure of a
growing population upon the means of subsistence generates the mass
migrations that overshadow the other events of history.</p>
<p>In 962 a band of Turkish adventurers from Turkestan invaded Afghani-
stan under the lead of Alptigin, a former slave, captured Ghazni, and
estab- lished there a Ghaznevid dynasty. Subuktigin (976-97), first
slave, then son-in-law, then successor, of Alptigin, extended his rule
over Peshawar and part of Khurasan. His son Mahmud (998-1030) took all
Persia from the Gulf to the Oxus, and in seventeen ruthless campaigns
added the Punjab to his empire, and much of India ’s wealth to his
coffers. Surfeited with plunder, and fretting over the unemployment
caused by demobilization, he spent part of his riches, and some of his
men, in building the congregational mosque of Ghazni. Says a Moslem
historian:</p>
<p>It had an immense nave, in which 6000 servants of God might
fulfill</p>
<p>their duties without inconvenience to one another. And he raised near
it a college, and supplied it with a library, and rare volumes. . . .
And to those pure walls came students, professors, and divines . . . and
from the endowments of the college they received their daily sustenance,
and all necessaries, and a yearly or monthly salary. 31</p>
<p>To this college and his court Mahmud brought many scientists,
including al- Biruni, and many poets, including Firdausi, who
reluctantly dedicated to him the greatest of Persian poems. During this
generation Mahmud stood near</p>

<p>Xthe top of the world in more senses than one; but seven years after
his death his empire passed into the hands of the Seljuq Turks.</p>
<p>It would be an error to picture the Turks as barbarians. As it was
necessary to modify that term as applied to the German conquerors of
Rome, so it must be said that the Turks were already passing out of
barbarism when they over- ran Islam. Moving westward from Lake Baikal,
the Turks of north central Asia organized themselves in the sixth
century under a khan or chagan. Forg- ing iron found in their mountains,
they made weapons as hard as ’their code, which punished not only
treason and murder, but adultery and cowardice, with death. The
fertility of their women outran the mortality of their wars. By a.d.
1000 a branch of Turks known by the name of their beg or leader Seljuq
dominated Transoxiana as well as Turkestan. Mahmud of Ghazni, thinking
to halt this rival Turkish power, seized a son of Seljuq, and impris-
oned him in India (1029). Undaunted and enraged, the Seljuq Turks under
the stern but masterful Tughril Beg took most of Persia, and paved their
fur- ther advance by sending to the Caliph al-Qaim at Baghdad a
deputation an- nouncing their submission to him and Islam. The Caliph
hoped that these fearless warriors might free him from his Buwayhid
overlords; he invited Tughril Beg to come to his aid. Tughril came
(1055), and the Buwayhids fled; al- Qaim married Tughril’s niece, and
made him “King of the East and the West” ( 1058) . One by one the petty
dynasties of Asiatic Islam crumbled before the Seljuqs, and acknowledged
again the supremacy of Baghdad. The Seljuq rulers took the title of
sultan — master — and reduced the caliphs to a merely religious role;
but they brought to the government a new vigor and competence, and to
Mohammedanism a new fervor of orthodox faith. They did not, like the
Mongols two centuries later, destroy what they conquered; they rapidly
absorbed the higher civilization, unified into a new empire what had
been the scattered members of a dying state, and gave it the strength to
endure and survive that long duel, between Christianity and Islam, which
we know as the Crusades.</p>

<p>In the year 1060 the Seljuq Turks extended their conquests to
Armenia.</p>
<p>That harassed country has felt the claws of rival imperialisms
through many centuries, because its mountains hindered its unity of
defense while its valleys provided tempting roads between Mesopotamia
and the Black Sea. Greece and Persia fought for those roads as highways
of trade and war; Xenophon’s Ten Thousand traversed them; Rome and
Persia fought for them; Byzantium and Persia, Byzantium and Islam,
Russia and Britain. Through all vicissitudes of ex- ternal pressure or
domination, Armenia maintained a practical independence, a vigorous
commercial and agricultural economy, a cultural autonomy that pro- duced
its own creed, literature, and art. It was the first nation to adopt
Chris-</p>

<p>tianity as its state religion (303). It took the Monophysite side in
the debate about the natures of Christ, refusing to admit that He had
shared the infirmities of human flesh. In 491 the Armenian bishops
parted from Greek and Roman Chris- tianity and formed an autonomous
Armenian Church under its own katholikos . Armenian literature used the
Greek language until the early fifth century, when Bishop Mesrob
invented a national alphabet, and translated the Bible into the Armenian
tongue. Since that time Armenia has had an abundant literature, chiefly
in religion and history.</p>
<p>From 642 to 1046 the .country was nominally subject to the caliphs,
but it remained virtually sovereign and zealously Christian. In the
ninth century the Bagratuni family established a dynasty under the title
of “Prince of Princes,” built a capital at Ani, and gave the country
several generations of progress and relative peace. Ashot III (952-77)
was much loved by his people; he founded many churches, hospitals,
convents, and almshouses, and (we are told) never sat down to meals
without allowing poor men to join him. Under his son Gagik I (990-1020)
— how peculiar our names must seem to the Armenians! — prosperity
reached its height: schools were numerous, towns were enriched by trade
and adorned by art; and Kars rivaled Ani as a center of literature,
theology, and philosophy. Ani had impressive palaces’and a famous
cathedral ( c . 980), subtly compounded of Persian and Byzantine styles;
here were piers and column clus- ters, pointed as well as round arches,
and other features that later entered into Gothic art. When, in 989, the
cupola of St. Sophia in Constantinople was de- stroyed by an earthquake,
the Byzantine emperor assigned the hazardous task of restoring it to
Trdat, the architect of the Ani cathedral. 32</p>
