<p>The Resurrection of the Arts</p>
<p>1095-1300</p>
<p>I. THE ESTHETIC AWAKENING</p>
<p>W HY is it that Western Europe, in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, reached a climax of art comparable with Periclean Athens
and</p>
<p>Augustan Rome?</p>
<p>The Norse and Saracen raids had been beaten off, the Magyars had been
tamed. The Crusades aroused a fever of creative energy, and brought back
to Europe a thousand ideas and art forms from the Byzantine and Moslem
East. The reopening of the Mediterranean, and the opening of the
Atlantic to Christian commerce, the security and organization of trade
along the rivers of France and Germany and on the northern seas, and the
expansion of industry and finance, generated a wealth unknown since
Constantine, new classes capable of affording art, and prosperous
communes each resolved to build a finer cathedral than the last. The
coffers of abbots, bishops, and popes were swelling with the tithes of
the people, the gifts of the merchants, the grants of nobles and kings.
The Iconoclasts had been defeated; art was no longer branded as
idolatry; the Church, which once had feared it, found in it now a
propitious medium for inculcating her faith and ideals among the
letterless, and for stirring souls to a devotion that lifted spires like
supplicat- ing litanies to the sky. And the new religion of Mary, rising
spontaneously from the hearts of the people, poured its love and trust
of the Divine Mother into magnificent temples where thousands of her
children might gather at once to do her homage and beg her aid. All
these influences, and many more, came together to flood half a continent
with profuse streams of unprece- dented art.</p>
<p>The ancient techniques had here and there survived barbarian
devastation and municipal decay. In the Eastern Empire the old skills
were never lost; and it was above all from the Greek East and Byzantine
Italy that artists and art themes now entered the life of the
resurrected West. Charlemagne drew into his service Greek artists
fleeing from Byzantine Iconoclasts; hence the art of Aachen married
Byzantine delicacy and mysticism to German solidity and earthiness. The
monk artists of Cluny, inaugurating in the tenth cen- tury a new era in
Western architecture and adornment, began by copying Byzantine models.
The school of monastic art developed at Monte Cassino</p>
<p>845</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>846</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>by Abbot Desiderius (1072) was taught by Greek teachers on Byzantine
lines. When Honorius III (1218) wished to decorate San Paolo fuori le
mura he sent to Venice for mosaicists; and those who came were steeped
in the Byzantine tradition. Colonies of Byzantine artists could be found
in a score of Western cities; and it was their style of painting that
molded Duccio, Cimabue, and the early Giotto himself. Byzantine or
Oriental motives — pal- mettes, acanthus leaves, animals within
medallions — came to the West on textiles and ivories and in illuminated
manuscripts, and lived hundreds of years in Romanesque ornament. Syrian,
Anatolian, Persian forms of archi- tecture — the vault, the dome, the
tower-flanked facade, the composite col- umn, the windows grouped by two
or three under a binding arch — appeared again in the architecture of
the West. History makes no leaps, and nothing is lost.</p>
<p>Just as the development of life requires variation as well as
heredity, and the development of a society needs experimental innovation
as well as stabi- lizing custom, so the development of art in Western
Europe involved not only the continuity of a tradition in skills and
forms, and the stimulation of Byzantine and Moslem examples, but also
the repeated turning of the artist from the school to nature, from ideas
to things, from the past to the present, from the imitation of models to
the expression of self. There was a somber and static quality in
Byzantine art, a fragile and feminine elegance in Arabic ornament, that
could never represent the dynamic and masculine vitality of a
rebarbarized and reinvigorated West. Nations that were rising out of the
Dark Ages toward the noon of the thirteenth century preferred the noble
grace of Giotto’s women to the stiff Theodoras of Byzantine mosaics;
and, laughing at the Semitic horror of images, they transformed mere
decoration into the smiling angel of the Reims Cathedral, and the Golden
Virgin of Amiens. The joy of life conquered the fear of death in Gothic
art.</p>
<p>It was the monks who, as they preserved classic literature,
maintained and disseminated Roman, Greek, and Oriental art techniques.
Seeking self- containment, the monasteries trained their inmates to the
decorative as well as the practical crafts. The abbey church required
altar and chancel furni- ture, chalice and pyx, reliquaries and shrines,
missal, candelabra, perhaps mosaics, murals, and icons to inform and
inspire piety; these the monks for the most part fashioned with their
own hands; indeed, the monastery itself was in many cases designed and
built by them, as Monte Cassino rises by Benedictine labor today. Most
monasteries included spacious workshops; at Chartres, for example,
Bernard de Tiron founded a religious house and gath- ered into it, we
are told, “craftsmen both in wood and iron, carvers and gold - smiths,
painters and stonemasons . . . and others skilled in all manner of
cunning work.” 1 The illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages were al
- most all the work of monks; the finest textiles were produced by monks
and nuns; the architects of the early Romanesque cathedrals were monks;

<p>CHAP. XXXl) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS 847</p>
<p>the eleventh and early twelfth centuries the abbey of Cluny furnished
most of the architects for Western Europe, and many of the painters and
sculp- tors; 3 and in the thirteenth century the abbey of St. Denis was
a thriving center of varied arts. Even the Cistercian monasteries, which
in the days of the watchful Bernard had closed their doors to
decoration, soon surrendered to the lure of form and the excitement of
color, and began to build abbeys as ornate as Cluny or St. Denis. As the
English cathedrals were usually mo- nastic minsters, the regular or
monastic clergy continued to the end of the thirteenth century to
dominate ecclesiastical architecture in England.</p>
<p>But a monastery, however excellent as a school and refuge for the
spirit, is condemned by its seclusion to be a repository of traditions
rather than a theater of living experiment; it is better fitted to
preserve than to create. Not until the widened demands of a richer laity
nourished secular artists did me- dieval life find the exuberant
expression, in unhackneyed forms, that brought Gothic art to fullness.
First in Italy, most in France, least in England, the emancipated and
specializing laymen of the twelfth century, grouped in guilds, took the
arts from monastic teachers and hands, and built the great
cathedrals.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ADORNMENT OF LIFE</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless it was a monk who wrote the most complete and revealing
summary of medieval arts and crafts. Theophilus — “lover of God” in the
monastery of Helmershausen near Paderborn — wrote, about 1 190, a Sched
- ula diversarum artium :</p>
<p>Theophilus, a humble priest . . . addresses his words to all who
wish, by the practical work of their hands, and by the pleasing
meditation of what is new, to put aside … all sloth of mind and
wandering of</p>
<p>spirit. . . . 〔Here shall such men find〕 all that Greece possesses
in the way of diverse colors and mixtures; all that Tuscany knows of
the</p>
<p>working of enamels … all that Arabia has to show of works
ductile,</p>
<p>fusible, or chased; all the many vases and sculptured gems and ivory
that Italy adorns with gold; all that France prizes in costly variety
of</p>
<p>windows; all that is extolled in gold, silver, copper, or iron, or
in</p>
<p>subtle working of wood or stone. 4</p>
<p>Here in a paragraph we see another side of the Age of Faith — men and
women, and not least monks and nuns, seeking to satisfy the impulse to
ex- pression, taking pleasure in proportion, harmony, and form, and
eager to make the useful beautiful. The medieval scene, however suffused
with re- ligion, is above all a picture of men and women working. And
the first and basic purpose of their art is the adornment of their work,
their bodies, and their homes. Thousands of woodworkers used knife,
drill, gouge, chisel, and polishing materials to carve tables, chairs,
benches, chests, caskets, cabi-</p>
<p>848 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>nets, stairposts, wainscots, beds, cupboards, buffets, icons,
altarpieces, choir stalls . . . with an incredible variety of forms and
themes in high or low relief, and often with a mischievous humor that
recognized no barrier between the sacred and the profane. On the
misericords one might find figures of misers, gluttons, gossipers,
grotesque beasts and birds with human heads. In Venice the wood carvers
sometimes made frames more beautiful and costly than the pictures they
enclosed. The Germans began in the twelfth century that re- markable
wood sculpture which would become a major art in the sixteenth.*</p>
<p>The workers in metal rivaled the workers in wood. Iron was wrought
into elegant gratings for windows, courtyards, and gates; for mighty
hinges that spread across massive doors in a variety of floral designs
(as on Notre Dame at Paris) ; for cathedral choir grilles as “strong as
iron” and as delicate as lace.</p>
<p>The arts of the precious metals and stones flourished amid general
poverty. The Merovingian kings had gold plate, and Charlemagne collected
at Aachen a treasure of goldsmiths’ work. The Church pardonably felt
that if gold and silver brightened the tables of barons and bankers,
they should also be used in the service of the King of Kings. Some
altars were of chased silver, some of chased gold, as in the church of
St. Ambrose at Milan, and the ca- thedrals of Pistoia and Basel. Gold
was normal for the ciborium or pyx that held the consecrated Host, for
the monstrance in which it was exposed to the veneration of the
faithful, for the chalice that contained the sacramental wine, and for
the reliquaries in which saintly relics were preserved; these vessels
were in many cases more beautifully worked than the most costly prize
cups of today. In Spain the goldsmiths made resplendent tabernacles to
bear the Host in processions through the streets; in Paris the goldsmith
Bonnard (1212) used 1 544 ounces of silver, and 60 of gold, to make a
shrine for the bones of St. Genevieve. We may judge the scope of the
goldsmith’s art from the seventy-nine chapters devoted to it by
Theophilus. There we find that every medieval goldsmith was expected to
be a Cellini — at once smelter, sculptor, enameler, jewel mounter, and
inlay worker. Paris in the</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXI ) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS 849</p>
<p>thirteenth century had a powerful guild of goldsmiths and jewelers;
and Parisian jewel cutters had already a reputation for producing
artificial gems. 5 The seals that rich men used to stamp the wax on
their letters or envelopes were carefully designed and carved. Every
prelate had an official ring; and every real or specious gentleman
flaunted at least one ring on his hands. Those who cater to human vanity
seldom starve.</p>
<p>Cameos — small reliefs on precious material — were popular among the
rich. Henry III of England had a “great cameo” valued at £ 200 (0,000) ;
Bald - win II brought a still more celebrated cameo from Constantinople
to house it at Paris in Sainte Chapelle. Ivory was painstakingly carved
throughout the Middle Ages: combs, boxes, handles, drinking horns,
icons, book covers, diptychs and triptychs, episcopal staffs and
croziers, reliquaries, shrines. . . . Astonishingly close to perfection
is a thirteenth-century ivory group in the Louvre depicting the Descent
from the Cross. Towards the end of that cen- tury romance and humor
gained upon piety, and delicate carvings of some- times very delicate
scenes appeared on mirror cases and toilet boxes designed for ladies who
could not be pious all the time.</p>
<p>Ivory was one of many materials used for inlay, which the Italians
called intarsia (from the Latin interserere , insert), and the French
termed mar- quetry ( marquer , to mark). Wood itself might be used as an
inlay in other woods: a design was chiseled into a block of wood, and
other woods were pressed and glued into the design. One of the more
recondite medieval arts was niello (Latin nigellus, black) — inlaying an
incised metal surface with a black paste composed of silver, copper,
sulphur, and lead; when the inlay hardened, the surface was filed till
the silver in the mixture shone. From this technique, in the fifteenth
century, Finiguerra would develop copperplate engraving.</p>
<p>The ceramic arts matured again out of industrial pottery as the
returning Crusaders aroused Europe from the Dark Ages. Cloisonne enamel
entered the West from Byzantium in the eighth century. In the twelfth a
plaque rep- resenting the Last Judgment * gave an excellent example of
champleve; i.e., the spaces between the lines of the design were
hollowed out into a copper ground, and the depressions were filled with
enamel paste. Limoges, in France, had made enameled wares since the
third century; in the twelfth it was the chief center, in the West, of
champleve and cloisonne. In the thir- teenth century Moorish potters in
Christian Spain coated clay vessels with an opaque tin glaze or enamel
as a base for painted decoration; in the fifteenth century Italian
merchants imported such wares from Spain in Majorcan trading ships, and
called the material majolica, changing r to / in their melo- dious
way.</p>
<p>The art of glass, so nearly perfected in ancient Rome, returned to
Venice from Egypt and Byzantium. As early as 1024 we hear of twelve
phiolarii</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Victoria and Albert Museum.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>there, whose products were so varied that the government took the
industry under its protection, and voted the title “gentlemen” to
glassmakers. In 1278 the glassworkers were removed to a special quarter
on the island of Murano, partly for safety, partly for secrecy; strict
laws were passed forbidding Venetian glassmakers to go abroad, or to
reveal the esoteric techniques of their art. From that “foot of earth”
the Venetia ns for four centuries domi- nated the art and industry of
glass in the Western world. Enameling and gilding of glass were highly
developed; Olivo de Venezia made textiles of glass; and Murano poured
out glass mosaic, beads, phials, beakers, tableware, even glass mirrors,
which in the thirteenth century began to replace mirrors of polished
steel. France, England, and Germany also made glass in this period, but
almost entirely for industrial use; the stained glass of the cathe-
drals was a brilliant exception.</p>
<p>Women have always received less credit in histories of art than they
de- served. The adornment of the person and the home are precious
elements in the art of life; and the work of women in dress design,
interior decoration, embroidery, drapery, and tapestry has contributed
more than most arts to that often unconscious pleasure which we derive
from the intimate and silent presence of beautiful things. Delicate
tissues deftly woven, and welcome to sight or touch, were highly prized
in the Age of Faith; they clothed altars, relics, sacred vessels,
priests, and men and women of high estate; and they themselves were
wrapped in soft, thin paper which took from them its “tis - sue paper”
name. In the thirteenth century France and England dethrone d
Constantinople as the chief producer of artistic embroidery; we hear of
em- broiderers’ guilds in Paris in 1258; and Matthew Paris, under the
year 1246, tells how Pope Innocent IV was struck by the gold-embroidered
vestments of English prelates visiting Rome, and ordered such opus
anglicanum for his copes and chasubles. Some ecclesiastical garments
were so heavy with jewels, gold thread, and small enamel plaques that
the priest so robed could hardly walk. 6 An American millionaire paid
0,000 for an ecclesiastical vestment known as the Cope of Ascoli.* The
most famous of medieval embroideries was the “dalmatic of Charlemagne”;
it was believed to be a product of Dal - matia, but was probably a
Byzantine work of the twelfth century; it is now one of the most
precious objects in the treasury of the Vatican.</p>
<p>In France and England embroidered hangings or tapestries took the
place of paintings, especially in public buildings. Their full display
was reserved for festal days; then they were hung under the arches of
church bays, and in the streets, and on processional floats. Usually
they were woven of wool and silk by the “tirewomen” or maids of feudal
chateaux under the superin - tendence of the chatelaine; many were woven
by nuns, some by monks. Tap- estries made no pretense to rival the
subtler qualities of painting; they were</p>

<p>to be seen from some distance, and had to sacrifice nicety of line
and shading to clarity of figure and brilliance and permanence of color.
They com- memorated an historical event or a famous legend, or cheered
gloomy in- teriors with representations of landscapes, flowers, or the
sea. Tapestries are mentioned as early as the tenth century in France,
but the oldest extant full specimens hardly antedate the fourteenth.
Florence in Italy, Chinchilla in Spain, Poitiers, Arras, and Lille in
France, led the West in the art of tapestry and rugs. The world-renowned
Bayeux tapestries were not strictly such, since their design was
embroidered upon the surface instead of forming part of the weave. They
derive their name from the cathedral of Bayeux that long housed them;
tradition ascribed them to William the Conqueror’s Queen Matilda and the
ladies of her Norman court; but ungallant scholarship prefers an
anonymous origin and a later date. 8 They rival the chronicles as an
authority for the Norman Conquest. Upon a strip of brown linen nineteen
inches wide and seventy-one yards long, sixty scenes show in procession
the preparation for the invasion, the Norse vessels cleaving the Channel
with high and figured prows, the wild battle of Hastings, the
transfixing and death of Harold, the rout of the Anglo-Saxon troops, the
triumph of blessed force. These tapestries are impressive examples of
patient needlework, but they are not among the finer products of their
kind. In 1803 Napoleon used them as propaganda to rouse the French to
invade England; 9 but he neglected to secure the blessing of the
gods.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PAINTING</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mosaic</li>
</ol>
<p>The pictorial art in the Age of Faith took four principal forms:
mosaic, miniatures, murals, and stained glass.</p>
<p>The mosaic art was now in its old age, but in the course of 2000
years it had learned many subtleties. To make the gold ground they loved
so well, mosaicists wrapped gold leaf around glass cubes, covered the
leaf with a thin film of glass to keep the gold from tarnishing, and
then, to avoid surface glare, laid the gilded cubes in slightly uneven
planes. The light was reflected at diverse angles from the cubes, and
gave an almost living texture to the whole.</p>
<p>It was probably Byzantine artists who in the eleventh century covered
the east apse and west wall of an old cathedral at Torcello — an island
near Ven- ice — with some of the most imposing mosaics in medieval
history. 10 The mosaics of St. M ark’s range over seven centuries in
authorship and style . Doge Domenico Selvo commissioned the first
interior mosaics in 1071, pre- sumably using Byzantine artists; the
mosaics of 1153 were still under Byzan-</p>

<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>tine tutelage; not until 1450 were Italian artists predominant in the
mosaic adornment of St. Mark’s. The twelfth -century Ascension mosaic of
the cen- tral cupola is a summit of the art, but it has a close rival in
the Joseph mosaics of the vestibule dome. The marble mosaic of the
pavement has survived through 700 years the tread of human feet.</p>
<p>At the other end of Italy Greek and Saracen workers united to produce
the mosaic masterpieces of Norman Sicily — in the Capella Palatina and
Mar- torana of Palermo, the monastery of Monreale, the cathedral of
Cefalu (1148). The wars of the papacy in the thirteenth century may have
retarded art in Rome; however, resplendent mosaics were made in that
period for the churches of Santa Maria Maggiore, Santa Maria in
Trastevere, St. John Lat- eran, and St. Paul Outside the Walls. An
Italian, Andrea Tafi (1213-94), designed a mosaic for the Baptistery at
Florence, but it was not up to the Greek work in Venice or Sicily.
Suger’s abbey at St. Denis (1150) had a magnificent mosaic floor, partly
preserved in the Cluny Museum; and the pavement ( c . 1268) of
Westminster Abbey is an admirable mingling of mosaic shades. But the
mosaic art never prospered north of the Alps; stained glass outshone it;
and with the coming of Duccio, Cimabue, and Giotto, murals crowded it
out even in Italy.</p>

<li>Miniatures</li>
</ol>
<p>The illumination of manuscripts with miniature paintings and
decoration in liquid silver and gold and colored inks continued to be a
favorite art, grate- fully adapted to monastic quiet and piety. Like so
many phases of medieval activity, it reached its Western apogee in the
thirteenth century; never again has it been so delicate, inventive, or
profuse. The stiff figures and drapes, and hard greens and reds, of the
eleventh century were gradually replaced with forms of grace and
tenderness in richer hues on backgrounds of blue or gold; and the Virgin
conquered the miniature even as she was capturing the cathedral.</p>
<p>During the Dark Ages many books were destroyed; those that remained
were doubly precious, and constituted, so to speak, a thin life line of
civiliza- tion in their text and art. 11 Psalters, gospels,
sacramentaries, missals, brevi- aries, books of hours were cherished as
the living vehicles of a divine revela- tion; no effort was too great
for their fit adornment; one might reasonably spend a day on an initial,
a week on a title page. Hartker, a monk of St. Gall, perhaps expecting
the end of the world with the century, made a vow in 986 to remain
within four walls the rest of his earthly life; he stayed in his tiny
cell till he died fifteen years later; and there he illuminated —
brightened with pictures and ornament — the Antiphonary of St. Gall .

<p>lingian exuberance; the enlumineur, as the French called the
miniaturist, sought depth and splendor of color, and a crowded fullness
and vitality of representation, rather than the illusion of
tridimensional space. Most fre- quently his subjects were taken from the
Bible, or the apocryphal gospels, or the legends of the saints; but
sometimes a herbal or a bestiary sought illus - tration, and he took
delight in picturing real or imaginary plants and animals. Even in
religious books the ecclesiastical rules for subject and treatment were
less defined in the West than in the East, and the painter was allowed
to range and frolic widely within his narrow room. Animal bodies with
human heads, human bodies with animal heads, a monkey disguised as a
monk, a monkey examining with proper medical gravity a phial of urine, a
musician giving a concert by scraping together the jawbones of an ass —
such were the topics that graced a Book of the Hours of the Virgin. 13
Other texts, sacred as well as profane, came to life with scenes of
hunting, tournament, or war; one thirteenth-century psalter included in
its pictures the inside of an Italian bank. The secular world,
recovering from its terror of eternity, was invad- ing the precincts of
religion itself.</p>
<p>English monasteries were fertile in this peaceful art. The East
Anglian school produced famous psalters: one treasured by the Brussels
library, an- other (“Ormsby”) at Oxford, a third (“St. Omer”) in the
British Museum. But the finest illumination of the age was French. The
psalters painted for Louis IX inaugurate a style of centered
composition, and division into framed medallions, obviously taken from
the stained glass of the cathedrals. The Lowlands shared in this
movement; the monks of Liege and Ghent at- tained in their miniatures
something of the warm feeling and flowing grace of the sculptures at
Amiens and Reims. Spain produced the greatest single chef- d’oeuvre of
thirteenth -century illumination in a book of hymns to the Virgin — Lay
cantigas del Rey Sabio (c. 1280) — “The Canticles of 〔Alfonso X〕 the
Wise King”; its 1226 miniatures suggest the labor and loyalty that
medieval books might receive. Such books, of course, were works of
calli- graphic as well as pictorial art. Sometimes the same artist
copied or com- posed and wrote the text, and painted the illumination.
In several manuscripts one hesitates to decide which seems more
beautiful — the decoration or the text. We paid a price for print.</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell how far the miniatures, in subject and
design, influ- enced murals, panels, icons, ceramic painting, sculptural
relief, and stained glass, and how far these influenced illumination.
There was among these arts a free trade in themes and styles, a
continuous interaction; and some- times the same artist practiced them
all. We do injustice to art and artist alike</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>854</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>when we separate one art too sharply from the rest, or the arts from
the life of their time; reality is always more integrated than our
chronicles; and the historian disintegrates for convenience’ sake the
elements of a civilization whose components flowed as a united stream.
We must try not to sever the artist from the cultural complex that
reared and taught him, gave him tradi- tions and topics — praised or
tormented him, used him up, buried him, and — more often than not —
forgot his name.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages, like any age of faith, discouraged individualism as
in- solent impiety, and bade the ego even of genius submerge itself in
the work and current of its time. The Church, the state, the commune,
the guild were the lasting realities; they were the artists; individuals
were the hands of the group; and when the great cathedral took form its
body and soul would stand for all the bodies and souls that its design
and building and adornment had consecrated and consumed. So history has
swallowed up nearly all the names of the men who painted the walls of
medieval structures before the thirteenth century; and war, revolution,
and the damp of time have almost swallowed up their work. Were the
methods of the muralists to blame? They used the ancient processes of
fresco and tempera — applying the colors to freshly plastered walls, or
painting upon dry walls with colors made ad- hesive by some glutinous
material. Both methods aimed at permanence, through permeation or
cohesion; even so the colors tended to flake off in the course of years,
so that very little remains of mural painting before the four- teenth
century. Theophilus (1190) described the preparation of oil colors, but
this technique lay undeveloped till the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The traditions of classic Roman painting were apparently snuffed out
by the barbarian invasions and the ensuing centuries of poverty. When
Italian mural painting revived it took its lead not from antiquity but
from the half- Greek, half-Oriental methods of Byzantium. Early in the
thirteenth century we find Greek painters working in Italy — Theophanes
at Venice, Apollonius at Florence, Melormus at Siena. . . . The earliest
signed panel pictures in the Italian art of this period bear Greek
names. Such men brought with them Byzantine themes and styles — symbolic
figures religio-mystical, making no claim to the representation of
natural attitudes and scenes.</p>
<p>Gradually, as wealth and taste rose in thirteenth-century Italy, and
the higher rewards of art drew better talents to their quest, Italian
painters — Giunta Pisano at Pisa, Lapo at Pistoia, Guido at Siena,
Pietro Cavallini at Assisi and Rome — began to abandon the dreamy
Byzantine manner, and to infuse their painting with the color and
passion of Italy. In the church of San Domenico at Siena Guido (1271)
painted a Madonna whose “pure, sweet face” 14 left far behind it the
frail and lifeless forms of the Byzantine painting of that age; this
picture almost begins the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>A generation later Duccio di Buoninsegna (1273-13 19) carried Siena
to a kind of civic-esthetic frenzy with his Maesta or “Majesty” of the
Virgin</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS 855</p>
<p>enthroned. The thriving citizens decided that the Divine Mother,
their feu- dal queen, should have her picture painted on an imposing
scale by the greatest artist available anywhere. They found it pleasant
to choose their townsman Duccio. They promised him gold, gave him food
and time, and watched every step of his work. When, after three years,
it was complete ( 1 3 1 1 ) , and Duccio had added a touching signature
— “Holy Mother of God, give Siena peace and Duccio life because he
painted thee thus”— a procession of bishops, priests, monks, officials,
and half the population of the city es- corted the picture (fourteen
feet long and seven wide) to the cathedral, amid the blare of trumpets
and the ringing of bells. The work was still half Byzan- tine in style,
aiming at religious expression rather than realistic portraiture; the
Virgin’s nose was too long and straight, her eyes too somber; but the
sur - rounding figures had grace and character; and the scenes from the
life of Mary and Christ, painted on the predellas and pinnacles, had a
new and vivid charm. Altogether this was the greatest painting before
Giotto.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Florence Giovanni Cimabue ( 1 240?-! 302) had
inaugurated a dynasty of painters that would rule Italian art for almost
three centuries. Born of a noble family, Giovanni doubtless saddened
them by abandoning law for art. He was a proud spirit, apt to cast aside
any of his works in which he or another had found a defect. While
stemming, like Duccio, from the Italian-Byzantine school, he poured his
pride and energy into his art to revo- lutionary effect; in him, more
than in the greater artist Duccio, the Byzantine style was superseded,
and a new path of advance was cleared. He bent and softened the hard
lines of his predecessors, gave flesh to spirit, color and warmth to
flesh, human tenderness to gods and saints; and by using bright reds,
pinks, and blues for the drapery, he endowed his paintings with a life
and brilliance unknown before him in medieval Italy. All this, however,
we must accept on the testimony of his time; not one of the pictures
attributed to him is unquestionably his; and the Madonna and Child with
Angels , painted in tempera for the Rucellai Chapel of Santa Maria
Novella in Flor- ence, is more probably by Duccio. 15 A tradition
disputed, but probably true, assigns to Cimabue a Virgin and Child
Between Four Angels in the Lower Church of San Francesco at Assisi. This
colossal fresco, usually dated 1296, and restored in the nineteenth
century, is the first extant masterpiece in Ital- ian painting. The
figure of St. Francis is bravely realistic — a man frightened to
emaciation by visions of Christ; and the four angels begin the
Renaissance alliance of religious subjects with feminine beauty.</p>
<p>In the closing years of his life Cimabue was appointed capomaestro of
mosaics at the cathedral of Pisa; and there, it is said, he designed for
the apse a mosaic of Christ in Glory Between the Virgin and St. John.
Vasari tells a pretty tale how Cimabue once found a shepherd lad of ten,
called Giotto di Bondone, drawing a lamb on a slate with a piece of
coal, and took him to</p>

<p>Florence as a pupil. 18 Certainly Giotto worked in Cimabue’s studio,
and oc - cupied his master’s house after Cimabue’s death. So began the
greatest line of painters in the history of art.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Stained Glass</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy was a century ahead of the North in murals and mosaics, a
century behind in architecture and stained glass. The art of painting
glass had been known to antiquity, but chiefly in the form of glass
mosaic. Gregory of Tours (538? — 93) filled the windows of St. Martin’s
with glass “of varied colors”; and in the same century Paul the
Silentiary remarked the splendor of sunlight as filtered through the
variously colored windows of St. Sophia’s at Constantinople. In these
cases, so far as we know, there was no attempt at making pictures with
the glass. But about 980 Archbishop Adalbero of Reims adorned his
cathedral with windows “containing histories”; 17 and in 1052 the
chronicle of St. Benignus described a “very an cient painted win- dow,”
representing St. Paschasius, in a church at Dijon. 18 Here was histori -
ated glass; but apparently the color was painted upon the glass, not
fused into it. When Gothic architecture reduced the strain on walls and
made space for larger windows, the abundant light thereby admitted into
the church al- lowed — indeed, demanded — the coloring of the panes; and
every stimulus was present to find a method of more permanently painting
glass.</p>
<p>Stain-fused glass was probably an offshoot of the art of enameled
glass. Theophilus described the new technique in 1 190. A “cartoon” or
design was laid upon a table, and was divided into small sections, each
marked with a symbol of the desired color. Pieces of glass were cut,
seldom more than air inch long or wide, to fit the sections of the
cartoon. Each piece of glass was painted in the designated color with a
pigment consisting of powdered glass mixed with varying metallic oxides
— cobalt for blue, copper for red or green,</p>
<p>manganese for purple The painted glass was then fired to fuse the
enamel</p>
<p>oxides with the glass; the cooled pieces were laid upon the design,
and were soldered together with thin strips of lead. In viewing a window
of such mosaic glass the eye hardly notices the leads, but makes of the
parts a con- tinuous colored surface. The artist was interested in color
above all, and aimed at a fusion of color tones; he sought no realism,
no perspective; he gave the queerest hues to the objects in his pictures
— green camels, pink lions, blue-faced knights. 19 But he achieved the
effect he aimed at: a brilliant and lasting picture, a softening and
coloring of the light admitted to the church, and the instruction and
exaltation of the worshiper.</p>
<p>The windows — even the great “roses”— were in most cases divided into
panels, medallions, circles, lozenges, or squares, so that one window
might show several scenes in a biography or theme. Old Testament
prophets were</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXl) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS 857</p>
<p>pictured opposite their New Testament analogues or fulfillments; and
the New Testament was amplified from the apocryphal gospels, whose
pictur- esque fables were so dear to the medieval mind. Stories of the
saints were even more frequent in the windows than episodes from the
Bible; so the ad- ventures of St. Eustace were narrated on the windows
of Chartres, and again at Sens, Auxerre, Le Mans, and Tours. Events of
profane history rarely appeared in stained glass.</p>
<p>Within a half century of its oldest known occurrence in France,
stained glass reached perfection at Chartres. The windows of that
cathedral served as models and goals for those at Sens, Laon, Bourges,
and Rouen. Thence the art crossed to England, and inspired the glass of
Canterbury and Lincoln; a treaty between France and England specified
that one of the glass painters of Louis VII ( 1 1 37-80) should be
allowed to come to England. 20 In the thir- teenth century the component
parts of the pane were made larger, and the color lost something of the
vibrating subtlety of the earlier work. Painting in grisaille —
decorative tracery with thin lines of red or blue on a gray mono- chrome
base — replaced, towards the end of that century, the color sympho- nies
of the great cathedrals; the mullions themselves, in ever more complex
designs, played a larger part in the picture; and though such window
tracery became in its turn a lovely art, the skill of the glass painter
declined. The splendor of stained glass had come with the Gothic
cathedral; and when the Gothic glory faded, the ecstasy of color died
away.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>SCULPTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Much Roman sculpture had been destroyed as loot by victorious barba-
rism, or as obscene idolatry by nascent Christianity; something had re-
mained, especially in France, to excite the imagination of barbarism
tamed and a Christian culture coming of age. In this art, as in others,
the Eastern Roman Empire had preserved old models and skills, had
overlaid them with Asiatic conventions and mysticism, and had
redistributed to the West the seeds that had come to it from Rome. Greek
carvers went to Germany after Theophano married Otto II (972); they went
to Venice, Ravenna, Rome, Naples, Sicily, perhaps to Barcelona and
Marseille. From such men, and from the Moslem artists of his Regno , the
sculptors of Frederick II may have learned their trade. When barbarism
became rich it could afford to wed beauty; when the Church became rich
she took sculpture, like the other arts, into the service of her creed
and ritual. That, after all, was the way the major arts had developed in
Egypt and Asia, in Greece and Rome; great art is the child of a
triumphant faith.</p>
<p>Like mural painting, mosaic, and stained glass, sculpture was
conceived not as independent, but as one phase of an integrated art for
which no lan-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>guage has a name — the adornment of worship. Primarily the sculptor’s
func - tion was to beautify the house of God with statuary and reliefs;
secondarily to make images or icons to inspire piety in the home; after
that, if time and funds remained, he might carve the likeness of secular
persons or adorn pro- fane things. In church sculpture the preferred
material was some lasting sub- stance like stone, marble, alabaster,
bronze; but for statuary the Church favored wood: such figures could be
borne without agony by Christians marching in religious pageantry.
Statues were painted, as in ancient religious art, and they were more
often realistic than idealized. The worshiper was to feel the presence
of the saint through the image; and so well was this end attained that
the Christian, like the devotee of older faiths, expected miracles of
the statue, and raised few doubts on hearing that the arm of an
alabaster Christ had moved in benediction, or that the breast of a
wooden Virgin had given milk.</p>
<p>Any study of medieval sculpture should begin with an act of
contrition. A great part of that sculpture was destroyed in England by
Puritan zealots — sometimes by act of Parliament; and in France by the
Art Terror of the Revolution. In England the reaction was against what
seemed to the new iconoclasts the pagan ornamentation of Christian
shrines; in France it at- tacked the collections, effigies, and tombs of
the hated aristocracy. All through these countries we find headless
statues, broken noses, battered sar- cophagi, smashed reliefs, shattered
cornices and capitals; a fury of accumu- lated resentment against
ecclesiastical or feudal tyranny vented itself at last in a Satanic
demolition. As if enlisting in a conspiracy of ruin, time and its
servant elements wore away surfaces, melted stone, effaced inscriptions,
waged against the works of man a cold and silent war that never granted
truce. And man himself, in a thousand campaigns, sought victory through
competitive devastation. We know medieval sculpture only in its
desolation.</p>
<p>We add misunderstanding to injury when we view its scattered members
in museums. It was not meant to be seen in isolation; it was part of a
theo- logical theme and an architectural whole; and what might seem
crude and ungainly in separation may have been skillfully suited to its
context in stone. The cathedral statue was an element in a composition;
it was adjusted to its place, and tended to follow, by elongation, the
vertical lift of the cathedral lines: the legs were kept together, the
arms were pressed to the body; some- times a saint was thinned and
stretched through all the length of a portal jamb. Less often a
horizontal effect was stressed, and the figures over a door might be
fattened and flattened as over the portal of Chartres, or a man or a
beast might be crumpled into a capital like a Greek god cornered in a
pedi- ment. Gothic sculpture was fused in an unrivaled unity with the
architecture it adorned.</p>
<p>This subordination of sculptural to structural line and aim
especially marked the art of the twelfth century. The thirteenth
witnessed an exuber-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS 859</p>
<p>ant rebellion of the sculptor, who now ventured out of formalism into
real- ism, out of piety into humor and satire and the zest of earthy
life. At Char- tres, in the twelfth century, the figures are somber and
stiff; at Reims, in the thirteenth, they are caught in natural
conversation or spontaneous action, their features are individual, there
is grace in their pose. Many figures on the cathedrals of Chartres and
Reims resemble the bearded peasants that still meet us in French
villages; the shepherd warming himself at the fire on the west portal of
Amiens might be in a Norman or Gaspe field today. No sculp- ture in
history rivals the whimsical veracity of Gothic cathedral reliefs. At
Rouen, crowded into little quatrefoils, we find a meditative philosopher
with the head of a pig; a doctor, half man and half goose, studying
another phial of urine; a music teacher, half man and half rooster,
giving a lesson on the organ to a centaur; a man changed by a sorcerer
into a dog, whose feet still wear his boots. 21 Funny little figures
crouch under the statues at Chartres, Amiens, Reims. A capital in
Strasbourg cathedral, since reformed, showed the burial of Reynard the
Fox: a boar and a goat carried his coffin, a wolf bore the cross, a hare
lighted the way with a taper, a bear sprinkled holy water, a stag sang
Mass, an ass chanted the funeral service from a book rest- ing on the
head of a cat. 22 In Beverley Minster a fox cowled like a monk preaches
from a pulpit to a congregation of pious geese. 23</p>
<p>The cathedrals are, among other things, menageries in stone; almost
all animals known to man, and many known only to medieval fancy, find
some- where room in those tolerant immensities. At Laon sixteen bulls
lower on the cathedral towers; they represent, we are told, the mighty
beasts that through patient years transported the stone blocks from the
quarries to the hilltop church. One day, said a genial legend, an ox
laboring upward fell in exhaus- tion; the load was precariously poised
on a slope when a miraculous ox ap- peared, slipped into the harness,
drew the cart to the summit, and then van- ished into the supernatural
air. 24 We smile at such fiction, and return to our tales of sex and
crime.</p>
<p>The cathedrals found place, too, for a botanical garden. Next to the
Vir- gin, the angels, and the saints, what better ornament could there
be for the house of God than the plants, fruits, and flowers of the
French or English or German countryside? In Romanesque architecture
(800-1200) the old Roman floral motives persisted — acanthus leaves and
the vine; in Gothic these formalized motives yielded to an amazing
profusion of indigenous plants, carved into bases, capitals, spandrels,
archivolts, cornices, columns, pulpits,</p>
<p>choirs, doorposts, stalls These forms are not conventional; they are
often</p>
<p>individualized varieties locally loved, and rendered to the life;
sometimes they are composite plants, another play of Gothic imagination,
but still fresh with the feel of nature. Trees, branches, twigs, leaves,
buds, flowers, fruit, ferns, buttercups, plantains, watercress,
celandine, rosebushes, strawberry plants, thistle and sage, parsley and
chicory, cabbage and celery — all are here,</p>
<p>860 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>falling from the never-emptied cornucopia of the cathedral; the
intoxication of spring was in the heart of the sculptor, and guided the
chisel into the stone. Not only spring; all the seasons of the year are
in these carvings, all the toil and solace of sowing, reaping, and
vintage are here; and in the whole history of sculpture there is nothing
finer in its kind than the “Vintage Capital” in the cathedral of Reims .
25</p>
<p>But this world of plants and flowers, birds and beasts, was ancillary
to the main theme of medieval sculpture — the life and death of man. At
Chartres, Laon, Lyons, Auxerre, Bourges, some preliminary reliefs tell
the story of the creation. At Laon the Creator counts on His fingers the
days left Him for His task; and in later scenes we see Him, tired with
His cosmic toil, leaning on His staff, sitting down to rest, going to
sleep; this is a god whom any peas- ant can understand. Other cathedral
reliefs show the months of the year, each with its distinctive work and
joy. Others show the occupations of man: peasants in the field or at the
wine press; some guiding horses or oxen in breaking furrows or pulling
carts; others shearing sheep or milking cows; and there are millers,
carpenters, porters, merchants, artists, scholars, even a philosopher or
two. The sculptor portrays abstractions through examples: Donatus is
grammar, Cicero is oratory, Aristotle is dialectic, Ptolemy is as-
tronomy. Philosophy sits with her head in the clouds, a book in her
right hand, a scepter in her left; she is Regina scientiarum, Queen of
the Sciences. Paired figures personify Faith and Idolatry, Hope and
Despair, Charity and Avarice, Chastity and Lechery, Peace and Discord; a
portal at Laon shows a combat of the Vices and the Virtues; and on the
west front of Notre Dame at Paris a graceful figure with bandaged eyes
represents the Synagogue, while opposite her is an even lovelier woman,
with royal mantle and com- manding air — the Church as the Bride of
Christ. Christ Himself appears sometimes tender, sometimes terrible;
taken down from the cross by His mother; rising from the tomb while near
by, in symbol, a lion brings her cubs to life with a breath; or sternly
judging the quick and the dead. That Last Judgment is everywhere in the
sculpture and painting of the churches; man was never allowed to forget
it; and here, too, only one intercessor could be relied upon to win
forgiveness for his sins. So in the sculpture, as in the litanies, Mary
took the leading place, the mother of infinite mercy, who would not let
her Son take too literally those awful words about the many called, the
few chosen.</p>
<p>There is a depth of feeling in this Gothic sculpture, a variety and
energy of life, a sympathy with all the forms of the plant and animal
world, a tender- ness, gentleness, and grace, a miracle of stone
revealing not flesh but the soul, that move and satisfy us when the
bodily excellence of Greek statuary has lost — perhaps through our aging
— something of its traditional lure. Beside the living figures of
medieval faith the heavy gods of the Parthenon pedi- ment seem cold and
dead. Gothic sculpture is technically deficient; there is</p>
<p>86i</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXI ) THE RESURRECTION OF THE ARTS</p>
<p>nothing in it that can match the perfection of the Parthenon frieze,
or the handsome gods and sensuous goddesses of Praxiteles, or even the
matrons and senators of the Ara Pacis at Rome; and doubtless those
comely ephebi and pliant Aphrodites once meant the joy of healthy life
and love. But the prejudices of our native creed, remembering its
loveliness and forgetting its terror, bring us back again and again to
the great cathedrals, and tip the scales to the Beau Dieu of Amiens, the
Smiling Angel of Reims, and the Vir- gin of Chartres.</p>
<p>As the skill of the medieval sculptor grew, he aspired to free his
art from architecture, and produce works that could please the
increasingly secular taste of princes and prelates, nobles and
bourgeoisie. In England the “mar - blers” of Purbeck, using the
excellent material quarried in that Dorsetshire — of Henry the Lion and
his lioness in the cathedral of Brunswick. France led Europe in the
quality of her Romanesque (twelfth-century) and Gothic
(thirteenth-century) statuary; but most of it is integrated with her
cathe- drals, and is best studied there.</p>
<p>Sculpture in Italy was not so intimately bound up with architecture,
the commune, and the guild as in France; and there, in the thirteenth
century, we begin to get individual artists whose personality dominates
their work and preserves their names. Niccolo Pisano embodied a
diversity of influences fused into a unique synthesis. Bom in Apulia
about 1225, he enjoyed the stimulating air of Frederick II’s regime;
there, apparently, he studied the re- mains and restorations of classic
art. 26 Moving to Pisa, he inherited the Ro- manesque tradition, and
heard of the Gothic style then at its apex in France. When he carved a
pulpit for Pisa’s baptistery he took for his model a Roman sarcophagus
of Hadrian’s time. He was deeply moved by the firm but grace - ful lines
of the classic forms; though his pulpit showed Romanesque and Gothic
arches, most of its figures bore Roman features and dress; the face and
robes of Mary in the panel of the Presentation were those of a Roman
matron; and in one corner a nude athlete proclaimed the spirit of
ancient Greece. Jealous of this masterpiece, Siena (1265) engaged
Niccolo, his son Giovanni, and his pupil Arnolfo di Cambio to carve a
still finer pulpit for the cathedral. They succeeded. Standing on
columns with Gothic flowered capitals, this pulpit of white marble
repeated the themes of the Pisan work,</p>
<p>86z</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>with a crowded panel of the Crucifixion. Here the Gothic influence
won over the classical; but in the feminine figures that crowned the
columns the antique mood found voice in the frank portrayal of rosy
health. As if to underscore his classic sentiments, Niccolo chiseled
upon the tomb of the ascetic St. Dominic at Bologna virile forms in
pagan style, full of the joy of life. In 1 27 1 he joined his son and
Arnolfo to carve the marble font still stand- ing in the public square
of Perugia. He died seven years later, still relatively young; but in
one lifetime he had made straight the way for Donatello and the rebirth
of classic sculpture in the Renaissance.</p>
<p>His son Giovanni Pisano ( c . 1240 -c. 1320) rivaled him in
influence, and surpassed him in technical skill. In 1 27 1 Pisa
commissioned Giovanni to build a cemetery fit for men who were then
dividing the western Mediterranean with Genoa. Holy earth was brought
from Mt. Calvary for the Campo Santo, or Sacred Field; around a grassy
rectangle the artist raised graceful arches in mingled Romanesque and
Gothic styles; masterpieces of sculpture were brought in to adorn the
cloisters, and the Campo Santo remained a monument to Giovanni Pisano
until the Second World War shattered half its arches into a neglected
ruin.* When .the Pisans were defeated by the Genoese (1284) they could
no longer afford Giovanni; he went to Siena, and helped to design and
execute the sculpture of the cathedral fagade. In 1 290 he chiseled some
reliefs for the bizarre face of the Orvieto Cathedral. Thence he
returned north to Pistoia, and carved for the church of Sant’ Andrea a
pulpit less virile than his father’s at Pisa, but excelling it in
natural - ness and grace; this, indeed, is the loveliest product of
Gothic sculpture in Italy.</p>
<p>The third member of this famous trio, Arnolfo di Cambio ( c . 1232
-c. 1 300) , continued the Gothic style under the patronage of the
popes, several of whom had a French background. At Orvieto he shared in
cutting the fagade, and made a handsome sarcophagus for Cardinal de
Braye. In 1 296, with the multidextrous versatility of Renaissance
artists, he designed, and began to execute, three of the glories of
Florence: the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, the church of Santa
Croce, and the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
<p>But with Arnolfo and these works we pass from sculpture to
architecture. All the arts had now returned to life and health; the old
skills were not only restored, but were breeding new ventures and
techniques with almost reck- less fertility. The arts were united as
never before or since — in the same en- terprise and the same man.
Everything had been prepared for the culminat- ing medieval art that
would combine them all in perfect co-operation, and would give its name
to a style and an age.</p>
<p>The Campo Santo is being restored.</p>
