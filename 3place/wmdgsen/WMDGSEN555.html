<h4 id="chapter-xxxvii-the-anatomy-of-revolution">CHAPTER XXXVII The
Anatomy of Revolution</h4>
<p>1774-89</p>
<p>W E HAVE examined the mind of France on the eve of the Revolution —
its philosophy, religion, morals, manners, literature, and art. But</p>
<p>hese were frail flowers growing from an economic ground; we cannot
understand them without a knowledge of their roots. Much less can we
understand the political convulsion that ended the Old Regime without
ex- amining in turn, however briefly, each organ of the French economy,
and inquiring how its condition made for the great debacle.</p>
<p>In dealing once more with agriculture, industry, commerce, and
finance, we should remember that they are not dismal abstractions but
living and sensitive human beings: nobles and peasants organizing the
production of food; managers and workers manufacturing goods; inventors
and scientists forging new methods and tools; towns throbbing with shops
and factories, worried housewives and rebellious mobs; ports and ships
alive with mer- chants, navigators, sailors, and adventurous spirits;
bankers risking, gaining, losing money like Necker, life like Lavoisier;
and, through all the agitated mass, the flow and pressure of
revolutionary ideas and discontent. It is a com- plex and tremendous
picture.</p>
<p>I. THE NOBLES AND THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>France was 24,670,000 men, women, and children; so Necker reckoned
the population in 1784. 1 The number had grown from 17,000,000 in 1715
through greater food production, better sanitation, and the absence of
for- eign invasion and civil war. The nation as a whole experienced a
rise of pros- perity during the eighteenth century, but most of the new
affluence was confined to the middle class. 2</p>
<p>All but two millions of the French were rural. Agricultural life was
di- rected by royal intendants, provincial administrators, and parish
priests, and by seigneurs — feudal lords — estimated in 1789 at some
26,000. These and their sons served their country in war in their
gallant, old-fashioned way (swords were now more an ornament than a
weapon). Only a small minority of the nobles remained at the court; the
majority lived on their estates, and claimed to earn their keep by
providing agricultural management, police surveillance, courts, schools,
hospitals, and charity. Most of these functions, however, had been taken
over by agents of the central government, and the peasant pro- prietors
were developing their own institutions for local administration. So</p>
<p>928</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>he nobility had become a vestigial organ, taking much blood from the
social organism, and giving little but military service in return. Even
this service aroused a public grievance, for the nobility persuaded
Louis XVI (1781) to exclude all but men with four generations of
aristocracy behind them from every major office in the army, the navy,
and the government.</p>
<p>It was further alleged against the nobles that they left vast areas
of their estates uncultivated, while thousands of city dwellers were
hungering for bread. True of many parts of France was Arthur Young’s
description of the Loire and Cher River sections: “The fields are scenes
of pitiable manage - ment, as the houses are of misery. Yet all this
country [is] highly improv- able, if they knew what to do with it.” 3 *
Not a few of the nobles were</p>
<p>Serfdom, in the sense of a person bound by law to a piece of land,
and permanently subject to its owner for dues and services, had largely
disap- peared from France by 1789; about a million serfs remained,
chiefly on monastic properties. When Louis XVI freed the serfs on the
royal domain (1779), the Parlement of Franche-Comte (in eastern France)
delayed nine months before registering his edict. The Abbey of Luxeuil
and the Priory of Fontaine, owning together eleven thousand serfs, and
the Abbey of St.- Claude in the present department of the Jura, with
twenty thousand serfs, refused to follow the King’s example, despite
appeals in which several ec - clesiastics joined with Voltaire. 5
Gradually these serfs bought their freedom, or gained it by flight; and
Louis XVI, in 1779, abolished the owner’s right to pursue fugitive serfs
outside his own domain.</p>
<p>Though ninety-five per cent of the peasants were free in 1789, the
great majority of these were still subject to one or more feudal dues,
varying in degree from region to region. They included a yearly rental
(doubled in the eighteenth century) , a fee for the right to bequeath
goods, and payment for use of the lord’s grist mills, bake ovens, wine
presses, and fishponds— on all of which he maintained a monopoly. He
reserved the right to hunt his game even into the pe asant’s crops. He
enclosed more and more of the common ground on which the peasant had
formerly grazed his cattle and cut wood. The corvee, in most of France,
had been commuted for a money payment, but in Auvergne, Champagne,
Artois, and Lorraine the peasant was still re- quired to give the local
seigneur three or more days of unpaid labor every year for the
maintenance of roads, bridges, and waterways. 6 In sum and on the
average the surviving fe udal dues took ten per cent of the peasant’s
produce or income. The ecclesiastical tithe took another eight to ten
per cent. Add the taxes paid to the state, the market and sales taxes,
and the fees</p>
<ul>
<li>Arthur Young, English gentleman farmer, traveled on the Continent in
1787, 1788, and 1789, and reported his observations in Travels in France
(1792). He had some English prejudices (“Take the mass of mankind, and
you have more good sense in half an hour in England than in half a year
in France” 4 ) ; bu t he seems to have given a fair and reliable account
of what he saw. We shall find him reporting prosperity as well as
poverty. His chief criticisms of France were of its technological
backwardness and its excessively centralized, ubiquitous, and autocratic
government.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION 929</p>
<p>paid to the parish priest for baptism, marriage, and burial, and the
peasant was left about half the fruit of his toil.</p>
<p>As the money payments received by the lords were reduced in value by
depreciation of the currency, the seigneurs sought to protect their
income by increasing the dues, by reviving dues long fallen into disuse,
and by en- closing more of the common lands. The collection of dues was
usually farmed out to professional agents, who were often heartless in
their work. When the peasant questioned the right to certain
requisitions he was told that they were listed on the rolls or registers
of the manors. If he challenged the authenticity of these rolls the
matter was submitted to the manorial court or the provincial parlement,
whose judges were controlled by the seigneurs. 7 When Boncerf, secretly
encouraged by Turgot, published (1776) a bro- chure, The Disadvantages
of the Feudal Rights, recommending the reduc- tion of such rights, he
was censured by the Parlement of Paris. Voltaire, aged eighty- two, rose
again to battle. “To propose the abolition of feudal rights,” he wrote,
“is tantamount to attacking the holdings of the gentlemen of the
Parlement themselves, most of whom possess fiefs…. It is a case of the
Church, the nobility, and the members of the Parlement… united against
the common enemy — i.e., the people.” 8</p>
<p>Something could be said for the feudal dues. From the noble’s point
of view they were a mortgage freely assumed by the peasant as part of
the price at which he bought a parcel of land from its legal owner — who
in many cases had bought it in good faith from its previous possessor.
Some poor nobles depended upon the dues for their sustenance. The
peasant suffered far more from taxes, tithes, and the demands and
ravages of war than from feudal dues. Hear the greatest and noblest of
French socialists, Jean Jaures: “If there had been, in the society of
eighteenth-century France, no other abuse than the despicable remains of
that [feudal] system, there would have been no need of a revolt to heal
the sore; a gradual reduction of feudal rights, a liberation of the
peasantry, would have accomplished the change peace- ably.” 9</p>
<p>The most remarkable feature of the French nobility was its
acknowledg- ment of guilt. Not only did many nobles join the philo
sophes in rejecting the old theology; some, as we have seen, laughed at
the outdated prerogatives of their caste. 10 A year before the
Revolution thirty nobles offered to renounce their pecuniary feudal
privileges. 11 All the world knows the idealism of the young Lafayette,
who not only fought for America, but, on returning to France, vigorously
engaged in the struggle for peaceful reform. He de- nounced slavery, and
devoted part of his fortune to freeing the slaves in French Guiana. 12
The profession of liberal principles, and the advocacy of reform, became
fashionable in a section of the aristocracy, especially among titled
ladies like Mesdames de La Marck, de Boufflers, de Brienne, and de
Luxembourg. Hundreds of nobles and prelates took an active part in cam-
paigns for equalizing taxes, checking governmental extravagance,
organizing charities, ending the corvee. 13 Some nobles, like the
Duchesse de Bourbon, gave most of their wealth to the poor. 14</p>
<p>All this, however, was only a graceful ornament on the visible fact
that</p>
<p>930</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>he French nobility had ceased to earn its keep. Many nobles tried to
fulfill their traditional responsibilities, but the contrast between the
luxurious idle- ness of rich seigneurs and the hardships of a populace
repeatedly on the verge of famine aroused hostility and scorn. Long ago
a great noble himself had passed sentence of death upon his caste. Hear
Rene-Louis de Voyer, Marquis d’ Argenson, secretary of state ( 1 744-47
) , writing about 1752:</p>
<p>The race of great lords must be destroyed completely. By great lords
I understand those who have dignities, property, tithes, offices, and
functions, and who, without deserts and without necessarily being
adults, are none the less great, and for this reason often worthless…. I
notice that a breed of good hunting dogs is preserved, but once it
deteriorates it is done away with. 15 It was these lords, rich, proud,
and often functionless, who initiated the Revolution. They looked fondly
back to the days before Richelieu, when their order was the ruling power
in France. When the parlements asserted their right to annul royal
edicts, the nobilities of race and sword joined with the nobility of the
robe — the hereditary magistrates — in an attempt to sub- ordinate the
king. They cheered the parlement orators who raised the cry for liberte;
they encouraged the people and the pamphleteers to denounce the absolute
power of Louis XVI. We cannot blame them; but by weaken- ing the
authority of the monarch they made it possible for the National As-
sembly of 1789, controlled by the bourgeoisie, to seize the sovereignty
in France. The nobles threw the first spadeful of earth that dug their
grave.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PEASANTS AND THE REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>On the fifty-five per cent of the French soil owned by the nobility,
the clergy, and the king, most of the agricultural work was done by
metayers, who received stock, tools, and seed from the owner, and paid
him, usually, half the yield. These sharecroppers were so poor generally
that Arthur Young pronounced the system “the curse and ruin of the whole
country”; 16 not so much because the owners were cruel, but because
incentives were weak.</p>
<p>The majority of the peasant proprietors who tilled forty-five per
cent of the soil were condemned to poverty by the small size of their
holdings, which limited the profitable use of machinery. Agricultural
technology in France lagged behind that of England. There were schools
of agriculture, and model farms, but only a few farmers took advantage
of them. Probably sixty per cent of the peasant proprietors owned less
than the five hectares (about thirteen acres) needed to support a
family, and the men were driven to hire themselves out as laborers on
large farms. Wages of farm laborers rose twelve per cent between 1771
and 1789, but in the same period prices rose sixty-five per cent or
more. 17 While agricultural production rose during the reign of Louis
XVI, the hired laborers grew poorer, and formed a rural proletariat
which, in periods of slack employment, served as a breeding ground for a
multitude of beggars and vagabonds. Chamfort thought it “in -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII ) THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION 93 1</p>
<p>contestable that there are in France seven million men who beg alms,
and twelve million who are unable to give alms.” 18</p>
<p>Probably the poverty of the peasants was exaggerated by travelers
because they noticed chiefly the visible conditions, and did not see the
currency and goods concealed to avoid the eye of the tax assessor.
Contemporary estimates conflict. Arthur Young found areas of poverty,
brutality, and filth, as in Brittany, and areas of prosperity and pride,
as in Beam. 19 By and large, pov- erty in rural France in 1789 was not
as bad as in Ireland, no worse than in Eastern Europe or in the slums of
some “affluent” cities of our time, but worse than in England or in the
ever bountiful valley of the Po. The latest studies indicate that “there
was, at the end of t he Old Regime, an agrarian crisis.” 20 When drought
and famine came, as in 1788 -89, the sufferings of the peasantry,
particularly in the south of France, were such that only the charities
distributed by the government and the clergy kept half the popula- tion
from starving.</p>
<p>The peasant had to pay for the state, the Church, and the
aristocracy. The taille, or land tax, fell almost entirely upon him. He
supplied almost all the manpower of the army’s infantry. He bore the
brunt of the government’s monopoly on salt. His labor maintained roads,
bridges, and canals. He might have paid the tithe more cheerfully, for
he was a pious “God - fearing” man, and the tithe was collected with
mercy, and seldom took a literal tenth; 21 but he saw most of the tithe
leaving the parish to support a distant bishop, or an ecclesiastical
idler at the court, or even a layman who had bought a share of future
tithes. The direct tax burden on the peasant was reduced by Louis XVI;
the indirect taxes were in many districts increased. 22</p>
<p>Was the poverty of the peasants the cause of the Revolution? It was a
dramatic factor in a complex of causes. The very poor were too weak to
revolt; they could cry out for relief, but they had neither the means
nor the spirit to organize rebellion, until they were aroused by the
more prosperous farmers, by the agents of the middle class, and by
uprisings of the Paris pop- ulace. Then, however, when the powers of the
state had been reduced by the intellectual development of the people,
when the army was dangerously infected with radical ideas, and local
authorities could no longer rely on military support from Versailles —
then the peasants became a revolutionary force. They assembled,
exchanged complaints and vows, armed themselves, attacked the chateaux,
burned the homes of unyielding seigneurs, and de- stroyed the manorial
rolls which were quoted as sanctioning the feudal dues. It was that
direct action, threatening a nationwide destruction of seignorial
property, that frightened the nobles into surrendering their feudal
privileges (August 4, 1789), and so bringing a legal end to the Old
Regime.</p>

<li>INDUSTRY AND THE REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Here especially the pre-Revolutionary picture is complex and obscure.

<p>93 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>merchants who provided the material and bought the product. ( 2 )
Guilds — masters, journeymen, and apprentices — produced handicraft
goods, chiefly for local needs. The guilds survived till the Revolution,
but by 1789 they had been fatally weakened by the growth of (3)
capitalistic free enterprise — companies free to collect capital from
any source, to hire anybody, to in- vent and apply new methods of
production and distribution, to compete with anybody, and to sell
anywhere. These establishments were usually small, but they were
multiplying; so Marseilles alone, in 1789, had thirty- eight soap
factories, forty-eight for hats, eight for glass, twelve sugar re-
fineries, ten tanneries. 23 In textiles, building, mining, and
metallurgy, capital- ism had expanded into large-scale enterprises,
usually through joint-stock companies — societes anonymes.</p>
<p>France was slow to adopt the textile machines that were inaugurating
the Industrial Revolution in England, but large textile factories were
operating in Abbeville, Amiens, Reims, Paris, Louviers, and Orleans, and
the silk in- dustry flourished at Lyons. The building trades were
raising those massive blocks of apartment houses that still give French
cities their characteristic physiognomy. Shipbuilding employed thousands
of workers in Nantes, Bor- deaux, Marseilles. Mining was the most
advanced of French industries. The state kept all rights to the subsoil,
leased the mines to concessionaires, and enforced a code of safety for
the miners. 24 Companies sank shafts to depths of three hundred feet,
installed expensive equipment for ventilation, drain- age, and
transport, and made millionaires. The Anzin firm (1790) had four
thousand workmen, six hundred horses, and twelve steam engines, and
mined 310,000 tons of coal per year. The mining of iron and other metals
supplied material for an expanding metallurgical industry. In 1787 the
Creusot stock company raised ten million livres of capital to apply the
latest machinery in the production of ironware; steam engines operated
bellows, hammers, and drills, and railways enabled one horse to pull
what had required five horses before.</p>
<p>Some startling inventions were developed by Frenchmen in these years.
In 1776 the Marquis de Jouffroy d’Abbans amused crowds along the River
Doubs with a sidewheeler boat propelled by a steam engine, thirty-one
years before Fulton’s Clermont steamed up and down the Hudson. Even more
spectacular were the first steps in the conquest of the air. In 17 66
Henry Cavendish had shown that hydrogen has a lower density than air;
Joseph Black concluded that a bladder filled with hydrogen would rise.
Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier worked on the principle that air loses
density when heated; on June 5, 1783, at Annonay, near Lyons, they
filled a balloon with heated air; it rose to a height of sixteen hundred
feet, and descended ten minutes later when its air had cooled. A
hydrogen-filled balloon, designed by Jacques- Alexandre Charles, made an
ascent from Paris on August 27, 1783, before 300,000 cheering
spectators; when it came down fifteen miles away a village crowd tore it
to pieces on the theory that it was a hostile in- vader from the sky. 25
On October 15 Jean-Fran§ois Pilatre de Rozier made the first recorded
human flight, using a Montgolfier balloon with heated air; this ascent
lasted four minutes. On January 7, 1785, Francois Blanchard, a</p>

<p>THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION</p>
<p>933</p>
<p>Frenchman, and John Jeffries, an American physician, flew in a
balloon from England to France. People began to talk of flying to
America. 26</p>
<p>Nourished with industry and commerce, the towns of France prospered
during the fatal reign. Lyons hummed with shops, factories, and
enterprise. Arthur Young was amazed by the splendor of Bordeaux. Paris
was now a business rather than a political center; it was the hub of an
economic com- plex that controlled half the capital, and so half the
economy, of France. In 1789 it had a population of some 600, ooo. 27 It
was not then an especially beautiful city; Voltaire described much of it
as worthy of Goths and Van- dals. 28 Priestley, visiting it in 1774,
reported: “I cannot say that I was much struck with anything except the
spaciousness and magnificence of the public buildings, and to balance
this I was exceedingly offended by the narrowness, dirt, a nd stench of
almost all the streets.” 29 Young gave a similar account:</p>
<p>The streets are nine-tenths dirty, and all without foot pavements.
Walking, which in London is so pleasant and so clean that ladies do it
every day, is here a toil and a fatigue to a man, and an impossibility
to a well-dressed woman. The coaches are numerous, and what is much
worse, there are an infinity of one-horse cabriolets, which are driven
by young men of fashion and their imi- tators,… with such rapidity as
to… render the streets exceedingly dan- gerous…. I have been myself many
times blackened with mud. 30</p>
<p>In the cities and towns a proletariat was taking form: men, women,
and children working for wages with tools and materials not their own.
There are no statistics of them, but they have been estimated, for the
Paris of 1789, at 75,000 families, or 300,000 individuals ; 31 and there
were proportionate masses in Abbeville, Lyons, and Marseilles. Hours of
work were long and wages were low, for a ruling of the Paris Parlement
(November 12, 1778) forbade the workers to organize. Between 1741 and
1789 wages rose twenty- two per cent, prices sixty-five per cent ; 32
the condition of the workers seems to have deteriorated in the reign of
Louis XVI. 33 When demand slackened, or (as in 1786) foreign competition
became severe, workingmen in great number were discharged, and became a
burden on charity. A rise in the price of bread — which constituted half
the food of the Parisian populace 34 — put thousands of families close
to starvation. At Lyons in 1787 thirty thou- sand persons were on public
relief; at Reims in 1788, after an inundation, two thirds of the
population were destitute; at Paris, in 1791, a hundred thousand fa
milies were listed as indigent. 35 “In Paris,” wrote A^ercier about
1785, “the [common] people are weak, pallid, diminutive, stunted, and ap
- parently a class apart from other classes in the state.” 36</p>
<p>Defying prohibitions, laborers formed unions and went on strike. In
1774 the silk workers of Lyons quit work, alleging that the cost of
living was ris - ing much faster than wages, and that the unregulated
laws of supply and demand were driving workers to a level of mere
subsistence. The employers, with well-stocked larders, waited for hunger
to bring the strikers to terms. Frustrated, many workers left Lyons for
other towns, even for Switzerland or Italy; they were halted at the
frontier and were brought back by force to their homes. The workers rose
in revolt, seized municipal offices, and established a brief
dictatorship of the proletariat over the commune. The government</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>called in the army; the revolt was suppressed; two leaders were
hanged; the strikers returned to their shops beaten, but hostile now to
the government as well as to their employers. 37</p>
<p>In 1786 they struck again, protesting that even with eighteen hours ’
work per day they could not support their families, and complaining that
they were treated “more inhumanly than domestic animals, for even these
are given enough to keep them in health and vigor.” 38 The city
authorities agreed to a rise in pay, but forbade any meeting of more
than four persons. A battalion of artillery took charge of enforcing
this prohibition; soldiers fired upon the strikers, killing several. The
strikers returned to work. The increase in pay was later revoked. 39</p>
<p>Riots against the cost of living occurred sporadically throughout the
sec- ond half of the eighteenth century. In Normandy there were six
between 1752 and 1768; in 1768 the rioters captured control of Rouen,
sacked the public granaries, pillaged the stores. Similar riots occurred
at Reims in 1770, Poitiers in 1772, Dijon, Versailles, Paris, Pontoise
in 1775, Aix-en-Provence in 1785, and again at Paris in 1788 and 1789.
40</p>
<p>What role did the poverty of the proletariat, or of the urban
populace in general, play in bringing on the Revolution? On the surface
it was a proxi- mate cause; the bread shortages and consequent riots in
Paris in 1788-89 raised the fever of the people to a point where they
were willing to risk their lives in defying the army and attacking the
Bastille. But hunger and wrath can give motive force; they do not give
leadership; it is likely that the riots would have been calmed by a
lowering of the price of bread if leadership from higher strata had not
directed the rioters to take the Bastille and march on Versailles. The
masses had as yet no idea of overturning the government, of deposing the
King, of establishing a republic. The proletariat talked hope- fully of
natural equality, but it did not dream of taking possession of the
state. It demanded, whereas the bourgeoisie opposed, state regulation of
the economy, at least to fixing the price of bread; but this was a
return to the old system, not an advance toward an economy dominated by
the working class. It is true that when the time for action came it was
the populace of Paris which, moved by hunger and roused by orators and
agents, took the Bastille and thereby deterred the King from using the
army against the As- sembly. But when that Assembly remade France it was
under the guidance, and for the purposes, of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE BOURGEOISIE AND THE REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>The outstanding feature of French economic life in the eighteenth
cen- tury was the rise of the business class. It had begun to prosper
under Louis XIV and Colbert; it benefited most from the excellent roads
and canals that facilitated trade; it grew rich on commerce with the
colonies; it rose to prominence in administrative posts (till 1781); it
controlled the finances of the state.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION</p>
<p>935</p>
<p>But it was harassed to the point of revolt by the tolls exacted for
seigneurs or the government on roads and canals, and by the
time-consuming examina- tion of the cargo at each toll station. There
were from thirty-five to forty such tolls to be paid by a boat carrying
cargo from south France to Paris. 41 Businessmen demanded free trade
within frontiers, but they were not sure that they wanted it between
nations. In 1786, moved by physiocratic theories, the government reduced
tariffs on textiles and hardware from England, in return for reduction
of English tariffs on French wines, glassware, and other products. One
result was a blow to the French textile industry, which could not meet
the competition of English mills equipped with later machinery.
Unemployment in Lyons, Rouen, and Amiens reached an explosive point.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lowering of tariffs promoted foreign trade, and
filled the coffers of the merchant class. That trade almost doubled
between 1763 and 1787, rising to over a billion francs in 1780. 42 The
port cities of France swelled with merchants, shippers, sailors,
warehouses, refineries, distilleries; in those towns the business class
was supreme long before the Revolution sanctioned its national
supremacy.</p>
<p>Part of mercantile prosperity, as in England, came from the capture
or purchase of African slaves, their transport to America, and their
sale there for work on the plantations. In 1788 French slave dealers
shipped 29,506 Negroes to St.-Domingue (Haiti) alone. 43 French
investors owned most of the soil and industries there and in Guadeloupe
and Martinique. In St.-Domingue thirty thousand whites used 480,000
slaves. 44 A Societe des Amis des Noirs was formed in Paris in 1788,
under the presidency of Condorcet, and includ- ing Lafayette and
Mirabeau fils , for the abolition of slavery, but the shippers and
planters overwhelmed the movement with protests. In 1789 the Chamber of
Commerce of Bordeaux declared: “France needs its colonies for the
maintenance of its commerce, and consequently it needs slaves in order
to make agriculture pay in this quarter of the world, at least until
some other expedient may have been found.” 45</p>
<p>Industrial, colonial, and other enterprises required capital, and
generated a spreading breed of bankers. Joint-stock companies offered
shares, the gov- ernment floated loans, speculation developed in the
sale and purchase of securities. Speculators hired journalists to
disseminate rumors designed to raise or lower the price of stocks. 46
A’lembers of the ministries joined in the speculation, and so became
subject to pressure or influence by the bankers. Every war made the
state more dependent upon the financiers, and made the financiers more
vitally concerned with the policy and solvency of the state. Some
bankers enjoyed a personal credit superior to that of the govern- ment;
hence they could borrow at a low rate, lend to the government at a
higher rate, and increase their wealth merely by bookkeeping — provided
their judgment was good and the state paid its debts.</p>
<p>The farmers general (financiers who bought, by an advance to the
state, the right to collect indirect taxes) were especially rich and
especially hated, for the indirect taxes, like sales taxes in general,
were most burdensome to those who had to spend much of their income on
the necessaries of daily</p>
<p>93^ ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>life. Some of these fermiers generaux, like Helvetius and Lavoisier,
were men of relative integrity and public spirit, contributing
abundantly to charity, literature, and art. 47 The government recognized
the evils of the tax-farming system, and reduced the number of farmers
general from sixty to forty in 1780, but public animosity continued. The
tax farm was abolished by the Revolution, and Lavoisier’s was one of the
heads that fell in the process.</p>
<p>As taxation played a leading role among the causes of the Revolution,
we must once more call to mind the various taxes paid by Frenchmen. ( 1
) The taille was a tax on land and personal property. Nobles were
exempted from it because of their military service; the clergy were
excused because they maintained social order and prayed for the state;
magistrates, head adminis- trators, and university officials were
exempt; almost all the taille fell upon the landowners of the Third
Estate — therefore chiefly upon the peasants. ( 2 ) The capitation, or
poll, tax was laid upon every head of a household; here only the clergy
were exempt. (3) The vingtieme, or twentieth, was a tax on all property,
real or personal; but the nobles escaped a large part of this and the
poll tax by using private influence, or engaging lawyers to find
loopholes in the law; and the clergy avoided the vingtieme by making a
voluntary pay- ment periodically to the state. (4) Every town paid a tax
( octroi ) to the government, and passed it on to its citizens. (5)
Indirect taxes were levied through (a) transport tolls; (b) import and
export dues; (c) excise taxes (aides) on wines, liquors, soap, leather,
iron, playing cards, etc.; and (d) governmental monopolies on the sale
of tobacco and salt. Every individual was required to buy annually a
stated minimum of salt from the government at a price fixed by it,
always higher than the market price. This salt tax (gabelle) was one of
the chief miseries of the peasant. (6) The peasant paid a tax to escape
the corvee. Altogether the average member of the Third Estate paid from
forty-two to fifty-three per cent of his income in taxes. 48</p>
<p>If we take together merchants, manufacturers, financiers, inventors,
engi- neers, scientists, minor bureaucrats, clerks, tradesmen, chemists,
artists, book- sellers, teachers, writers, physicians, and untitled
lawyers and magistrates as constituting the bourgeoisie, we can
understand how by 1789 it had become the richest and most energetic part
of the nation. It probably owned as much rural land as the nobility, 49
and it could acquire nobility merely by buying a noble fief or a post as
one of the many “secretaries” to the king. While the nobility lost
numbers and wealth through idleness, extravagance, and biolog- ical
decay, and the clergy lost ground through the rise of science, philoso-
phy, and an urban epicurean life and code, the middle classes grew in
money and power by the development of industry, technology, commerce,
and finance. They filled with their products or imports the boutiques,
or stores, whose splendor astonished foreign visitors to Paris, Lyons,
Reims, or Bor- deaux. 50 While wars were bankrupting the government they
enriched the bourgeoisie, which provided transport and materiel. The
growing prosperity was almost confined to the towns; it eluded the
peasantry and the proletariat, and appeared most visibly in merchants
and financiers. In 1789 forty French merchants had a combined wealth of
sixty million livres; 51 and one banker, Paris-Montmartel, amassed a
hundred million. 52</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIl)</p>
<p>THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION</p>
<p>937</p>
<p>The essential cause of the Revolution was the disparity between
economic reality and political forms — between the importance of the
bourgeoisie in the production and possession of wealth and its exclusion
from governmental power. The upper middle class was conscious of its
abilities and sensitive to its slights. It was galled by the social
exclusiveness and insolence of the nobility — as when the brilliant Mme.
Roland, invited to stay for dinner in an aristocratic home, found
herself served in the servants’ quarters. 53 It saw the nobility milking
the coffers of the state for extravagant expenditures and feasts while
denying political or military office or promotion to those very men
whose inventive enterprise had expanded the tax-yielding economy of
France, and whose savings were now supporting the treasury. It saw the
clergy absorbing a third of the nation’s income in maintaining a
theology that almost all educated Frenchmen considered medieval and
infantile.</p>
<p>The middle classes did not wish to overthrow the monarchy, but they
aspired to control it. They were far from desiring democracy, but they
wanted a constitutional government in which the intelligence of all
classes could be brought to bear upon legislation, administration, and
policy. They demanded freedom from state or guild regulation of industry
or commerce, but they were not averse to state subsidies, or to support
from the peasants and the city populace in achieving middle-class aims.
The essence of the French Revolution was the overthrow of the nobility
and the clergy by a bourgeoisie using the discontent of peasants to
destroy feudalism, and the discontent of urban masses to neutralize the
armies of the king. When, after two years of revolution, the Constituent
Assembly had become supreme, it abolished feudalism, confiscated the
property of the Church, and legalized the organization of merchants, but
forbade all organizations or gatherings of workingmen (June 14, 1791).
54</p>
<p>Specifically and immediately the financiers were alarmed by the
possibility that the government to which they had lent so much money
might declare bankruptcy — as it had done, in whole or in part,
fifty-six times since Henry IV 55 Tfhg holders of government bonds lost
faith in Louis XVI; contractors who worked on state enterprises were
uncertain of their payment, or of its value when it came. Businessmen in
general felt that the only escape from national bankruptcy was (and so
it proved to be) the full taxation of all classes, especially of the
wealth accumulated by the Church. When Louis XVI hesitated to extend the
taille to the privileged classes, lest he lose their support for his
shaking throne, the bondholders, almost unconsciously, and despite their
generally conservative principles, became a revolutionary force. The
Revolution was due not to the patient poverty of the peasants but to the
endangered wealth of the middle class.</p>
<p>V. THE GATHERING OF THE FORCES</p>
<p>All these revolutionary forces were subject to the influence of
ideas, and used them to clothe and warm desires. In addition to the
propaganda of the philosophers and the physiocrats, there were scattered
communists who con-</p>
<p>93^ ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>inued and extended the socialism expounded in the preceding
generation by Morelly, Mably, and Linguet. 56 Brissot de Warville, in
Recherches philoso- phiques sur le droit de propri ete (1780),
anticipated Pierre Proudhon’s “ La propriete, c’est le vol ” by arguing
that private property is theft of public goods. There is no “sacred
right… to eat the food of twenty men when one man’s share is not
enough.” The laws are “a conspira cy of the stronger against the weaker,
of the rich against the poor.” 57 Brissot later apologized for his early
books as schoolboy ebullitions; he became a leader of the Gi- rondins,
and was guillotined for moderation (1793).</p>
<p>In 1 789, shortly before the taking of the Bastille, Francois Boissel
issued a Catechisme du genre humain, which went the whole distance to
communism. All evils are due to “the mercenary, homicidal, and
antisocial class which has governed, degraded, and destroyed men till
now.” 58 The strong have en - slaved the weak, and have established the
laws to govern them. Property, marriage, and religion have been invented
to legitimize usurpation, violence, and deceit, with the result that a
small minority own the land, while the majority live in hunger and cold.
Marriage is private property in women. No man has a right to more than
he needs; everything above this should be distributed to each according
to his need. Let the rich idlers go to work or cease to eat. Turn the
monasteries into schools. 59</p>
<p>The most interesting and influential of these radicals was
Frangois-£mile Babeuf. After serving nobles and clergy in their
assertion of feudal rights against the peasants, 80 he sent to the
Academy of Arras (March 21, 1787) a proposal that it offer a prize for
the best essay on the question “With the</p>
<p>Such ideas played only a modest part in engendering the Revolution.
There was hardly a trace of socialist sentiment in the cahiers (bills of
griev- ances) that came to the States-General from all quarters of
France in 1789; none of them contained attacks upon private property or
the monarchy. The middle class was in control of the situation.</p>
<p>Were the Freemasons a factor in the Revolution? We have noted the
rise of this secret society in England (1717), and its first appearance
in France ( 1 7 34). It spread rapidly through Protestant Europe;
Frederick II favored it in Germany, Gustavus III in Sweden. Pope Clement
XII (1738) forbade ecclesiastic or secular authorities to join or help
the Freemasons, but the Paris Parlement refused to register this bull,
so depriving it of legal effect in France. In 1789 there were 629
Masonic lodges in Paris, usually with fifty to a hundred members. 82
These included many nobles, some priests, the broth-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVII )</p>
<p>THE ANATOMY OF REVOLUTION</p>
<p>939</p>
<p>ers of Louis XVI, and most leaders of the Enlightenment. 63 In 1760
Helve- tius founded the Loge des Sciences; in 1770 the astronomer
Lalande ex- panded this into the Loge des Neuf Soeurs, or Lodge of the
Nine Sisters (i.e., the Muses). Here gathered Berthollet, Franklin,
Condorcet, Chamfort, Greuze, Houdon, and, later, Sieyes, Brissot,
Desmoulins, Danton. 64</p>
<p>Theoretically the Freemasons excluded the “godless libertine” and the
“stupid atheist”; 65 every member had to profess belief in “the Great
Archi - tect of the Universe.” No further religious creed was required,
so that in general the Freemasons limited their theology to deism. They
were appar- ently influential in the movement to expel the Jesuits from
France. 66 Their avowed purpose was to establish a secret international
brotherhood of men bound in fellowship by assemblage and ritual, and
pledged to mutual aid, religious toleration, and political reform. Under
Louis XVI they entered actively into politics; several of their
aristocratic members — Lafayette, Mira- beau pere et pis, the Vicomte de
Noailles, the Due de La Rochefoucauld- Liancourt, and the Due d’Orleans—
became liberal leaders in the National Assembly. 67</p>
<p>Last came the definitely political clubs. Organized at first on the
English model — for eating, conversation, and reading — they became,
toward 1784, centers of semi-revolutionary a gitation. There, said a
contemporary, “they hold forth loudly and without restraint on the
rights of man, on the advan- tages of freedom, on the great abuses of
inequality of condition.” 68 After the</p>
<p>So, as with most pivotal events in history, a hundred diverse forces
con- verged to produce the French Revolution. Fundamental was the growth
of the middle classes in number, education, ambition, wealth, and
economic power; their demand for a political and social status
commensurate with their contribution to the life of the nation and the
finances of the state; and their anxiety lest the treasury render their
governmental securities worthless by declaring bankruptcy. Subsidiary to
this factor, and used by it as aids and threats, were the poverty of
millions of peasants crying out for relief from dues and taxes and
tithes; the prosperity of several million peasants strong enough to defy
seigneurs, tax collectors, bishops, and regiments; and the organized
discontent of city masses suffering from the manipulation of the bread
supply, and from the lag of wages behind prices in the historic spiral
of inflation.</p>
<p>Add to this a maze of contributory factors: the costly extravagance
of the court; the incompetence and corruption of the government; the
weaken- ing of the monarchy by its long struggle with the parlements and
the nobil- ity; the absence of political institutions through which
grievances could be legally and constructively expressed; the rising
standards of administration expected by a citizenry whose intellect had
been sharpened beyond that of any contemporary people by schools and
books and salons, by science,</p>
<p>94 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVII</p>
<p>philosophy, and the Enlightenment. Add the collapse of press
censorship under Louis XVI; the dissemination of reform or revolutionary
ideas by Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, d’Alembert, d’Holbach, Helvetius,
Morellet, Morelly, Mably, Linguet, Mirabeau pere , Turgot, Condorcet,
Beaumarchais, Mirabeau fils, and a thousand other writers whose sum and
brilliance and force had never been equaled, and whose propaganda
penetrated into every class but the peasantry, into the barracks of the
army, the cells of monas- teries, the palaces of the nobility, the
antechambers of the King. Add the catastrophic decline of faith in the
credibility of a Church that had upheld the status quo and the divine
right of kings, had preached the virtues of obedience and resignation,
and had amassed a hoard of enviable wealth while the government could
not find the means to finance its expanding tasks. Add the spread of
belief in a “natural law” that required a humane justice for every
rational being regardless of birth, color, creed, or class, and in a
boun- tiful “state of nature” in which all men had once been equal,
good, and free, and from which they had fallen because of the
development of private prop- erty, war, and caste-oriented law. Add the
rise and multiplication of lawyers and orators ready to defend or attack
the status quo, and to arouse and organize public sentiment; the
profusion and fury of pamphleteers; the secret activity of political
clubs; the ambition of the Due d’Orleans to replace his cousin on the
throne of France.</p>
<p>Bring all these factors together in the reign of a gentle and
benevolent, weak and vacillating King bewildered by the maze of
conflicts about him, and the contradictory motives within him; let them
operate upon a people more keenly conscious of its grievances, more
passionate, excitable, and imaginative than almost any other people
known to history; and all that would be needed to unite and ignite these
forces in a disruptive explosion would be some event affecting
multitudes, and reaching deeper than thought to the most powerful
instincts of men. Perhaps that was the function of the drought and
famine of 1788, and the cruel winter of 1788- 89. “Hunger alone will
cause this great revol ution,” the Marquis de Girardin had pre - dicted
in 1 78 1. 69 Hunger came to the countryside, to the towns, to Paris; it
was sharp enough in the masses to overcome tradition, reverence, and
fear, and to provide an instrument for the aims and brains of well-fed
men. The dykes of law and custom and piety broke, and the Revolution
began.</p>
