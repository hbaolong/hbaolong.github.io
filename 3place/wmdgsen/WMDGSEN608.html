<h4 id="chapter-xiii-literature-versus-napoleon">CHAPTER XIII Literature
versus Napoleon</h4>
<p>I. THE CENSOR</p>
<p>N APOLEON was more interested in the stage than in literature. He</p>
<p>noted carefully the programs of the Theatre-Frangais, expressed his
judgment on them, and was largely responsible for their discarding
Voltaire and reviving Corneille and Racine. His taste in literature was
not so respect- able. He read fiction eagerly, and took many novels —
mostly romantic — with him on his campaigns. His table talk at
St. Helena contained some good literary criticism, showing knowledge of
Homer, Virgil, Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine, Mme. de Sevigne,
Voltaire, Richardson, and Rousseau; but he was quite dead to
Shakespeare. “It is impossible to finis h any of his plays; they are
pitiful. There is nothing in them that comes anywhere near Cor- neille
or Racine.” 1 (French translations of Shakespeare were pitifully inade -
quate.)</p>
<p>Like most men of affairs he had no respect for writers on economics
or government; he considered them phrasemongers with little corrective
sense of reality, or of the nature and limits of man. He was sure that
he knew bet- ter than they what the French people wanted and should
have: efficiency and integrity in government, moderation in taxes,
freedom of enterprise in business, regularity of provisions, security of
remunerative employment in industry, peasant ownership, and a proud
place for France in the parade of states; if this were given them the
people would not insist on determining measures, or filling offices, by
a count of noses after a contest of words. In his laborious pursuit of
those ends — and of his own power or glory — he would not long tolerate
interference by lords of the rostrum or the pen. If these gentry could
be quieted by prizes, pensions, or political plums, such seda- tives
would be provided; otherwise disturbers of the consular or imperial
peace should be barred from publication, or from Paris or France. “Unlim
- ited freedom of the press,” Napoleon wrote in 1802, “would very soon
re - establish anarchy in a country where all the elements for such a
condition are already present.” 2</p>
<p>To watch public opinion, Napoleon — following Directory precedents —
ordered postmasters to open private mail, make note of hostile passages,
re- seal the envelopes, and send copies of the excerpts to himself or to
the “Black Cabinet” in the General Post Office at Paris. 3 He instructed
his per - sonal librarian to make and bring to him, “daily between five
and six o’clock,” summaries of political material in current
periodicals; “to submit to me, every ten days, an analysis of the
brochures or books published within the previous ten days”; to report on
the content and political te ndencies of each</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 287</p>
<p>play performed, within forty- eight hours after its premiere; and
“every first and sixth day [of the ten- day week] between five and six
o’clock, he will submit to me a bulletin on the posters, placards, or
advertisements that may be worthy of attention; he will also report on
whatever has come to his knowledge, and has been done or said, in the
various lycees, literary assem- blies, sermons,… that might be of
interest from the point of view of politics and morals.” 4</p>
<p>On January 17, 1800 — again continuing Directory custom — Napoleon
or- dered the suppression of sixty of the seventy-three newspapers then
pub- lished in France. By the end of the year only nine survived, none
of them radically critical. “Three hostile newspapers,” he said, “are
more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.” 5 Le Moniteur universel
regularly defended Napoleon’s policies; sometime s he composed articles
— even book reviews — for it, unsigned, but betraying their origin by
their authoritative style. A wit renamed this government organ Le
Menteur [liar] Universel.®</p>
<p>I want you to write to the editor of Le Journal des debats, Le
Publiciste, and La Gazette de France — these, I think, are the
newspapers most widely read — in order to declare to them that… the
Revolutionary times are over, and that there is but one single party in
France; that I shall never tolerate newspapers that say or do anything
against my interests; that they may publish a few little articles with
just a little poison in them, but that one fine morning somebody will
shut their mouths. 7</p>
<p>On April 5, 1800, censorship was extended to the drama. The govern-
ment argued that opinions individually and privately expressed might do
little harm, but that the same opinions when put into the mouth of a
famous historical character, and proclaimed from the stage with the
force and elo- quence of a popular actor, would have an influence
explosively multiplied by the mutual reverberation of feelings — and by
the irresponsibility of indi- viduals — in a theatrical audience. 8 The
censorship excluded from public per- formances any criticism of
monarchy, and any praise of democracy. La Mort de Cesar was banished
from the boards because the audience applauded the speeches of Brutus
against dictatorship. 9</p>
<p>Finally the state took control of all printing. “It is very important
that - cept substitutions proposed by the government. Even after the
censor has given his consent, and the work has been printed, the
minister of police is authorized to confiscate, and even to completely
destroy, the published edi- tion, no matter at what loss to the author
or the publisher. 11</p>
<p>It was in this prison of the mind that literature struggled to
survive under Napoleon. The most heroic effort was made by a woman.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>

<li>MME. DE STAEL: 1799-1817</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>N ap ole on’ s N emesis</li>
</ol>
<p>The Committee of Public Safety had banished her from France; the
Direc- tory had reduced this to exclusion from Paris; the day after its
fall she hur- ried back to the capital (November 12, 1799), and took an
apartment in the Rue de Grenelle in the fashionable Faubourg
St. -Germain. The new con- sular government — i.e., Napoleon — made no
protest against her return.</p>
<p>Soon she had opened a new salon, partly because “conversing in Paris…
has always been to me the most fascinating of all pleasures,” 1 2 partly
because she was determined to play a part in the direction of events.
She did not admit that such a role was unbecoming a woman; it seemed to
her quite be- coming if the woman (like her) had both money and brains;
and particularly becoming to the heiress of Jacques Necker, whom she
considered the un- appreciated hero of the Revolution. Incidentally the
government still owed him the twenty million francs he had loaned it in
1789; part of her resolve was to regain that sum for her father and her
patrimony. Her ideal (like his) was a constitutional monarchy allowing
freedom of press, worship, and speech, and protecting the property of
the rich against the envy of the poor. In this sense she felt that she
was faithful to the Revolution as defined by the National Assembly of
1789-91. She scorned the regicides, and welcomed to her salon her titled
neighbors of the Faubourg, who daily prayed for a Bour- bon restoration.
Nevertheless she centered her gatherings around Benjamin Constant, who
was all for a republic, and who, as a member of the Tribu- nate, opposed
every move of Napoleon from consular to imperial power. She welcomed
also the brothers of the First Consul, for they too were un- comfortable
under his growing authority.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the men of standing in the political and intellectual
world of Paris in 1800 found their way to her soirees, eager to learn
the latest po- litical gossip, or to hear Madame sail off in such
conversation as Paris had not heard from a woma n since Mme. du Deffand.
Mme. de Tesse declared: “If I were queen, I would order Mme. de Stael to
talk to me all the time.” 13 Ger - maine herself wrote that “the
necessity of conversation is felt by all classes in France; speech is
not there, as elsewhere, merely a means of communica- tion;… it is an
instrument on which they are fond of playing.” 14</p>
<p>She did not at once oppose Napoleon; indeed, if we may believe Bour-
rienne, she wrote him some flattering letters in the early Consulate,
even to offering herself to his service. 15 But his resolute ignoring of
her advances, his expanding censorship, his scorn of intellectuals in
politics, his conception of women as breeders and charming toys not to
be trusted with a thought, stung her to reply in kind. When he called
her guests ideologues she called him an ideophobe; and as her ire warmed
she described him as “Robespierre on horseback,” 10 or as the bourgeois
gentilhomme on the throne. 17</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON</p>
<p>289</p>
<p>On May 7, 1800, she moved her household, and a small retinue of de-
votees, to Coppet for the summer. Napoleon had left Paris the day before
to cross the Alps and meet the Austrians at Marengo. Germaine later
confessed: “I could not help wishing that Bonaparte might be defeated,
as that seemed the only means of stopping the progress of his tyranny.”
18 In the fall of the year, bored with Coppet and Mont Blanc, she
returned to the capital, for she lived on conversation, and “French
conversation exists nowhere but in Paris.” 19 Soon she gathered a bevy
of geniuses in her salon, and their pre - dominating topic was
Napoleon’s dictatorship. “She carries a quiver full of arrows,” he
complained. “They pretend that she speak s neither of politics nor of
me; but how, then, does it come to pass that all who see her like me
less?” 20 “Her home,” he said at St. Helena, “became quite an arsenal
against me. People went there to be dubbed knights in her crusade.” 21
Yet he ad - mi tted: “That woman teaches people to think who never took
to it before, or have forgotten how.” 22</p>
<p>He felt that as a man seeking to pull France out of chaos by giving
her an efficient administration, and meanwhile leading her armies to
victory against hostile coalitions, he had the right to expect, and, if
necessary, en- force, some unity of morale in the public, some
coordination of the national spirit with the national will to defend
France’s new republic and its “natu - ral” frontiers; but this wom an
gathered and united against him both the royalists and the Jacobins, and
comforted his enemies. Germaine’s father</p>
<p>In the spring of 1801 Napoleon wrote to his brother Joseph: “Monsieur
de Stael is in the most abject misery, and his wife gives dinners and
balls.” 24 Joseph relayed the rebuke, Germaine went to Monsieur’s room
in the Place de la Concorde, and found him in the last stages of
paralysis. She attended to his care, and in May, 1802, she took him with
her when she left Paris for Switzerland. He died on the way, and was
buried in the cemetery of Coppet. In that year, increasingly excitable,
Mme. de Stael began to take opium.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Author</li>
</ol>
<p>She was the greatest European authoress of her time, and the greatest
French author, barring Chateaubriand. She had written fifteen books, now
forgotten, before 1800; in that year she offered a major work, De la
Litter a- ture; thereafter she produced two novels — Delphine (1803) and
Corinne (1807) — that made her famous throughout Europe; in 1810-13 s h
e fought the batde of her life to publish her masterpiece, De /’
Allemagne; at her death</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>she left another major work, Considerations sur… la Revolution
frangaise, and Les Dix Annees d’exil. All of those here named were
substantial and conscientious productions, some running to eight hundred
pages. Mme. de Stael worked hard, loved assiduously, and wrote
passionately; she fought to the end the strongest man of her time, and
sadly triumphed in his fall.</p>
<p>De la Litterature consideree dans ses rapports avec les institutions
sociales undertook a large and heroic theme: “I propose to examine the
influence of religion, morals, and laws upon literature, and the
influence of literature upon religion, morals, and laws.”* It still
breathes the spirit of the eighteenth - sophical enlightenment) as “the
appreciation of things according to rea - son ,” 26 and only in the face
of death did she waver from her faith in the life of reason. “The
triumph of the light [les lumieres ] has always been favorable to the
greatness and betterment of mankind.” 27</p>
<p>But, she continues (having read Rousseau as well as Voltaire), the
growth of the intellect is not enough; knowledge is only one element in
understand- ing. The other is feeling. There must be a sensitivity of
the soul as well as of the senses. Without it the soul would be a tabula
mortua, a dead receiver of physical sensations; with it the soul enters
into the life of other living beings, shares their wondering and
suffering, feels the soul within the flesh, the God behind the material
world. From this viewpoint the Romantic literature of the misty north —
Germany, Scandinavia, Great Britain — is as important as the classic
literature of the sunny south — Greece and Italy; the poems of “Ossian”
are as important as Homer’s epics, and W erther was the greatest book of
its time.</p>
<p>Napoleon (in his youth) would have agreed with these evaluations,
but</p>

<p>he must have been disturbed by the author’s view of the relations
between</p>
<p>All in all, this was a remarkable book for a woman of thirty-four
years and several million francs. There are errors, of course, in these
six hundred pages, for when the mind outgrasps its reach it is bound to
risk a fall — though it may shake to the ground some elusive fruit.
Madame was a bit vague in history and literature; she thought the Irish
were Germans, and that Dante was a minor poet; but she argued bravely
for a liberal government and a reasonable Christianity, and she spilled
a hundred apergus on her way. She foresaw that the development of
statistics might make government more in- telligent, and that political
education might help prepare candidates for pub- lic office. She
remarked prophetically that “sc ientific progress makes moral progress a
necessity; for if man’s power is increased, the checks that restrain him
from abusing it must be strengthened.” 29 “There is scarcely an idea of
the eighteenth century which [the book] does not transmit, scarcely an
idea of the twentieth century which it does not contain in germ.” 30</p>
<p>She had written, in this volume, her lifelong plaint — that “the
entire social order… is arrayed against a woman who wants to rise to a
man’s reputa - tion” in the realms of art and thought. 31 Now she had to
make an exception; for, as she wrote twenty- one years later, “in the
spring of 1800 I published my work on literature, and the success it met
with restored me completely to favor with society; my drawing room
became again filled.” 32 The faint of heart who had shied away from her
salon after Constant’s blast against dic - tatorship returned penitent
and adulant; and the Little Corporal in the Tuileries had to admit that
he had found a foe to match his mettle.</p>
<p>In August, 1802, Jacques Necker sent to Consul Lebrun Les Dernieres
Vues de politique et de finance — his last views on politics and money.
It ex- cused the dictatorship of Napoleon, but as a necessary evil,
presumably tem- porary; it warned against the continued concentration of
power in the hands of the military; it expressed regret that the
finances of the new gov- ernment depended so heavily upon war
indemnities; and it proposed a more liberal constitution of which
Napoleon would be the “guardian.” Lebrun showed the book to Napoleon,
who, already half imperial, resented the no- tion that he should reduce
his power. Convinced that Mme. de Stael had guided the pen of her
father, he issued an order excluding her from Paris — i.e., in effect,
closing her mischief-making salon. He forgot that she could</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>write as well as speak. She spent the winter of 1802-03 Geneva, but
in December she again became the talk of Paris by publishing a novel,
Delphine. No one reads it now; everyone of literary or political
consciousness read it then, for it was part of a virile struggle between
a woman and her time.</p>
<p>Delphine is a virtuous girl who longs and fears to, yield; otherwise
she is Mme. de Stael. Leonce (= Narbonne) is a handsome aristocrat who
loves Delphine but abstains from her because a rumor accuses her of
“affairs”; he cannot risk his social standing by making her his wife. He
marries Matilde de Vernon, whose mother is a scheming witch who covers
her lies with wit; Paris saw this lady as Talleyrand despite her skirts,
and Talleyrand revenged himself by remarking of the masculine authoress
that she had disguised both him and herself as women. Delphine,
rejected, retires to a convent, where the abbess hurries her into a vow
of lifelong chastity. When Leonce discovers her innocence he thinks of
divorcing his unresponsive wife and courting Del- phine, but he
hesitates to ruin his career by violating the Catholic code of
irrefragable monogamy. Matilde dies, a victim of dramatic convenience;
Leonce persuades Delphine to elope with him and surrender to his
passion; he deserts her, goes off to join the emigres , is caught and
condemned to death. Delphine, in love with his cruelty, rushes to save
him, but arrives only in time to see him shot; whereupon she too falls
dead.</p>
<p>This absurd and typically romantic plot served the authoress as a
podium from which to discuss the legitimacy of divorce, the bigotry of
Catholicism (she had inherited Protestantism), the moral rights of women
as against the double standard, and the validity of the individual
conscience as against the honor code of a class. Her arguments were well
received by the intelligentsia of Paris, but they did not please
Napoleon, who was turning to Catholicism as a cure for the mental and
moral turmoil of France. On October 13, 1803, he issued an order
forbidding Mme. de Stael to approach within forty leagues of Paris.</p>
<p>She thought it was just the right time to visit Germany. She had
learned enough German to read it, though not to speak it; why not now
sample the music of Vienna, the wit of Weimar, and the royal society of
Berlin? On November 8, with son Auguste, daughter Albertine, two
servants, and her now platonic cavaliere servente Constant, she crossed
the Rhine at Metz into Germany.</p>

<p>Her first impression, at Frankfurt, was hostile; all the men seemed
fat, lived to eat, and ate to smoke; she found) it difficult to breathe
when they were near. They wondered at this proud woman who could not
appreciate the Qemutlichkeit of their pipes. Goethe’s mother wrote to
him: “She op - , pressed me like a millstone. I avoided her wherever I
could, refused all invita- tions to go to things she was to attend, and
breathed more freely when she left.” 33</p>
<p>Germaine, with her retinue, hurried on, to’ Weimar, where she found
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 293</p>
<p>atmosphere purified by poetry. The town was dominated by writers,
artists, musicians, and philosophers; the court was judiciously and
tolerantly led by Duke Charles Augustus, his wife the Duchess Luise, and
his mother the Duchess Dowager Anna Amalie. These people were well
educated; they smoked with discrimination, and nearly all of them spoke
French. Moreover, many of them had read Delphine, many more had heard of
her war against Napoleon; and all noted that she had money and spent it.
They feted her with dinners, theater parties, dances, and balls; they
summoned Schiller to read scenes from Wilhelm Tell; they listened to her
reciting long passages from Racine. Goethe, then at Jena, tried to play
truant by pleading a cold; the Duke urged him to come to Weimar
nevertheless; he came, and con- versed with Madame uncomfortably. He was
alarmed by her frank warning that she intended to print her report of
his remarks. 34 She was disappointed to find that he was no longer
Werther, having changed from a lover to a pontiff. He tried to confuse
her with contradictions; “my obstinate con - trariness often drove her
to despair, but it was then that she was most ami- able, and that she
displayed her mental and ve rbal agility most brilliantly.” 35
“Fortunately for me,” she recalled, “Goethe and Wieland spoke French ex
- tremely well; Schiller struggled.” 36 She wrote of Schiller with
affection, of Goethe with respect; he and Napoleon were the only men she
had met who made her realize her limitations. Schiller was fatigued by
the rapidity of her thought and speech, but he ended by being impressed.
“Satan,” he wrote</p>
<p>She found the mists of Berlin depressing after the brilliance of
Weimar. The leaders of the Romantic movement in Germany were absent or
dead; the philosophers were immured in distant universities — Hegel at
Jena, Schel- ling at Wurzburg; Germaine had to content herself with the
King, the Queen, and August Wilhelm von Schlegel, whose wide knowledge
of lan- guages and cultures delighted Ter. She engaged him to come with
her to Coppet as tutor to her son Auguste; he agreed, and fell in love
with her at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>At Berlin she received word that her father was dangerously ill. She
hur– ried back to Coppet, but before reaching it she learned that he had
died (April 9, 1804). It was a blow more desolating than any in her duel
with Napoleon. Her father had been her moral as well as her financial
mainstay; in her view he had always been right, and ever good; and not
all her lovers could take his place. She found comfort in writing an
idyl of adoration — Monsieur Necker’s Character and Private Life — and
in beginning work on her masterpiece, De V Allemagne. She inherited most
of her father’s fortune, and now had an income of 1 20,000 francs per
year.</p>
<p>In December she went to seek the sun in Italy. She took along her
three</p>
<p>2 94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>children — Auguste, Albertine, and Albert — and Schlegel, who now
tutored her also, for he found her poorly informed about Italian art. At
Milan they were joined by a still better Baedeker — Jean-Charles-Leonard
de Sismondi, who was beginning to write his learned History of the
Italian Republics. He too fell in love with Germaine — or with her mind
or her income — until, like Schlegel, he discovered that she never took
a commoner seriously. Together they moved through Parma, Modena,
Bologna, and Ancona to Rome. Joseph Bonaparte, always fond of her, had
given her letters of introduction to the best society there. She was
lionized by the aristocracy, but found the princes and princesses less
interesting than the courtly cardinals, who, as men of the world, knew
her books, her wealth, and her feud with Napoleon, and were not
disturbed by her Protestant faith. She was received with an ovation, and
with improvised poetry and music, into the Accademia dell’ Arcadia; she
used that experience in introducing Corinne.</p>
<p>In June, 1805, she was back in Coppet, soon again surrounded by
lovers, friends, scholars, diplomats (Prince Esterhazy of Vienna, Claude
Hochet of Napoleon’s Council of State) , even a ruler— the Elector of
Bavaria. Coppet’s was now a more famous salon than any in Paris. “I just
returned from Cop - pet,” wrote Charles - Victor de Bonstetten, “and I
feel completely stupefied… and exhausted by the intellectual debauches.
More wit is expended at Coppet in a single day than in many a country
during a whole year.” 38 The assemblage was sufficiently numerous and
talented to stage complete dramas; Germaine herself played the lead in
Andromaque and Phedre, and some guests thought her performances were
surpassed only by the queens of the Paris stage. On other occasions
there were recitals of music or poetry. Three times a day the table was
set, sometimes for thirty guests; fifteen servants were kept busy; and
in the gardens lovers might wander, and new friend- ships might be
made.</p>
<p>Germaine’s time -beaten lovers — Montmorency, Constant, Schlegel,
Sis- mondi — had cooled considerably, exhausted by her demand for
obedient devotion, and she was warming herself with passion for Prosper
de Barante. He was twenty-three, she was thirty-nine, but her pace soon
tired him, and he sought refuge in distance and the indecisiveness which
she was satirizing in the Oswald of Corinne. That once famous novel was
nearing completion, and called for a French printer, who would need the
imprimatur of Napo- leon’s police. Prosper’s father, prefect of the
department of Leman, assured Fouche that Madame had been “reserved and
circumspect” for the past year.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 295</p>
<p>know she is not far from it.” 40 (Secretly and briefly she stole into
Paris sometime in the spring of 1807.) Amid preparations for the battle
of Fried- land, Napoleon wrote to Fouche, April 19:</p>
<p>Among the thousand and one things concerning Madame de Stael that
come into my hands, here is a letter from which you can see what a fine
French- woman we have there…. It truly is difficult to restrain one’s
indignation at the spectacle of all the metamorphoses this whore, and an
ugly one at that, is undergoing. I shall not tell you what projects this
ridiculous coterie has already formed in case by a happy accident I
should be killed, since a police minister may be assumed to be informed
of this.</p>
<p>And on May 1 1, again to Fouche:</p>
<p>This madwoman of a Madame de Stael writes me a six-page letter, in
double Dutch…. She tells me she has bought an estate in the valley of
Montmorency and draws the conclusion that this will entitle her to
reside in Paris. I repeat to you that to leave such a hope to that woman
is to torture her gratuitously. If I showed you the detailed evidence of
everything she has done at her coun- try place during the two months she
resided there, you would be astonished. Indeed, although at five hundred
leagues from France, I know better what hap- pens there than does my
Minister of Police. 41</p>
<p>So, on April 25, 1807, Germaine unwillingly returned to Coppet. Con-
stant, constant despite inconstancies, accompanied her partway, but
diverged at Dole to stay with his ailing father. Arrived at Coppet, she
sent Schlegel to tell Constant that unless he rejoined her soon she
would kill herself. Benja- min knew that this classic threat was a
siren, not a swan, song, but he came, and silently bore her reproaches.
He had long since ceased to love her, but “how can one tell the truth to
one whose only answer consists in swallowing opium?” On July 10 Juliette
Recamier came for a long visit; Germaine fell in love with her, and
decided to live.</p>
<p>The police allowed Corinne to be printed, and its publication in
the</p>
<p>spring of 1807 gave its author a triumph that consoled her for
Napoleon’s victory at Friedland on June 14. The government-sponsored
reviews were hostile, but thousands of readers were charmed, and said
so. Today we are not enchanted by its form — an ecstatic romance
interspersed with dull and dated essays on Italian scenery, character,
religion, manners, literature, and art; and no one is thrilled by the
hero’s “manly face” (he turns out to be spineless), or “the divine
inspiration enthroned in” the heroine’s eyes. 42 But in 1 807 Italy was
not yet an overwritten land, more familiar to us, in history and art,
than our own; romance was spreading its wings; romantic love was
struggling to be freed from parental power, economic bonds, and moral
taboos; the rights of women were beginning to find voice. Corinne had
all these fascinations, embodied in a fair iviprovatrice who sings
spontaneous poetry and strums a bewitching lyre. Corinne, in her prime,
is visibly Ger- maine, with “an Indian shawl twined about her lustrous
black curls;… her arms transcendently beautiful,… her figure rather
robust”; moreover, her conversation “united all that is natural,
fanciful, just, sublime, powerful,</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>and sweet.” 43 Strange to say, the unsentimental Emperor, stranded on
St. Helena, took up the book and could not lay it down until he had read
it to its end. 44</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Understanding Germany</li>
</ol>
<p>To the task of overthrowing Napoleon and managing a menagerie of
geniuses and epicures, Madame now added the delicate enterprise of
explain- ing Germany to France. Even while her newborn Corinne was
battling for life against a subjugated press, she was hiding in her
secret self a bold and massive opus on the land beyond the Rhine. To
prepare herself conscien- tiously she set out on another tour of Central
Europe.</p>
<p>On November 30, 1807, she left Coppet with Albert, Albertine,
Schlegel, and her valet Eugene (Joseph Uginet). At Vienna she heard
music by Haydn, Gluck, and Mozart, but left no mention of Beethoven.
During three of five weeks in Austria she carried on an amorous
correspondence with an Austrian officer, Moritz O’Donnell; offered him
money and marriage, lost him, and wrote to Constant letters of limitless
devotion — “My heart, my life, everything I have is yours if you wish
and as you wish”; 45 he contented him - self by borrowing some of her
money. At Teplitz and Pirna she conferred with Friedrich von Gentz, an
ardent anti-Bonaparte publicist; learning of these meetings, Napoleon
concluded that she was aiming to disrupt the peace that he had recently
signed at Tilsit in July. At Weimar she found neither Schiller (who had
died in 1805) nor Goethe. She passed on to Gotha and Frankfurt; then,
suddenly ill and depressed, she hurried back to Coppet.</p>
<p>Perhaps this intimation of mortality shared in her turn toward
mysticism; Schlegel contributed to it; but a much stronger influence
came from the as- cetic Julie von Kriidener and the lecherous dramatist
Zacharias Werner, both of whom sojourned at Coppet in 1808. By October
of that year the guests and the language were predominantly German, and
the lumieres of the En- lightenment had yielded to a mystic religion.
“There is no reality on this earth,” Germaine wrote to O’Donnell,
“except religion and the power of love; all the rest is even more
fugitive than life itself.” 46</p>
<p>It was in this mood that she wrote De FAllemagne. By 1810 it was
nearing completion, and she longed to be in Paris for its printing. She
wrote humbly to Napoleon, telling him that “eight years’ [exile and]
misery modify all characters, and destiny teaches resignat ion.” She
proposed to go to the United States; she asked for a passport, and
permission for an interim stay in Paris. The passport was granted; the
permission was not. 47 Nevertheless, in April, 1 8 re, she moved with
her family and Schlegel to Chaumont (near Blois), from which she
superintended the printing of her three-volume manuscript in Tours. In
August she moved to neighboring Fosse.</p>
<p>The proofs of the first two volumes were submitted by Nicolle,
the</p>
<p>printer, to the censors in Paris. They agreed to the publication
after the deletion of a few unimportant sentences. Nicolle printed five
thousand copies, and sent advance copies to influential persons. On June
3 the sympa-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 297</p>
<p>hetic Fouche was dismissed as minister of police, and was succeeded
by the rigorous Rene Savary, Due de Rovigo. On September 25 Juliette
Recamier brought to the censor the proofs of Volume III, and to Queen
Hortense a full set of proofs for transmission — with a letter from the
authoress — to the Emperor. Savary, apparently with Napoleon’s approval,
decided that the book was so unfavorable to France and its ruler that
its distribution could not be allowed. He ordered the printer to suspend
the publication, and, on October 3, sent a stern notice to Mme. de Stael
that she was to carry out at once her declared intention to go to
America. On October 1 1 a detachment of gendarmes entered the printer’s
plant, smashed the type plates, and car- ried away all obtainable copies
of the volumes; these were later crushed into pulp. Other officers
demanded the manuscript; Germaine gave them the original, but her son
Auguste secreted and preserved a copy. The authoress reimbursed the
printer for his losses, and fled back to Coppet.</p>
<p>On Germany , as published in 1813, is an earnest attempt to survey,
with brevity and sympathy, every aspect of German civilization in the
age of Napoleon. That a woman with so many cares and lovers should have
found the leisure, the energy, and the competence for such an enterprise
is one of the marvels of that exciting time. Through the Swiss
internationalism in her background, through her marriage with a Holstein
baron, through her Prot- estant heritage and her hatred of Napoleon, she
was prepared to give Ger- many the benefit of nearly every doubt, to use
its virtues as an indirect criti- cism of Napoleon and tyranny, and to
present it to France as a culture rich in sentiment, tenderness, and
religion, and therefore well suited to correct the intellectualism,
cynicism, and skepticism then current in literate France.</p>
<p>Strange to say, she did not care for Vienna, though, like her, it was
both gay and sad — gay with wine and talk, sad with the mortality of
love and the proliferation of Napoleon’s victories. It was Catholic and
southern with mu - sic, art, and almost childlike faith; she was
Protestant and northern, heavy with food and sentiment, and floundering
in philosophy. There was no Kant here, but there was Mozart; no ardor of
controversy, no fireworks of wit, but there was the simple pleasure of
friends and lovers, parents and children, promenading in the Prater and
watching the Danube pass idly by.</p>
<p>Even the Germans disconcerted her; “stoves, beer, and the smoke of to
- bacco surround all the common folk with a thick and hot atmosphere
from which they are never inclined to escape.” 48 She deplored the
monotonous simplicity of German dress, the complete domestication of the
men, the readiness to submit to authority. “The separation into classes…
is more dis - tinct in Germany than anywhere else;… everybody keeps his
rank, his place,… as if it were his established post.” 49 She missed, in
Germany, that cross-fertilization of aristocrats, authors, artists,
generals, politicians, which she had found in French society; hence “the
nobles have few ideas, the men of letters have too little practice in
affairs”; 50 the ruling class remains feudal, the intellectual class
loses itself in airy dreams. Here Madame quoted Jean Paul Richter’s
famous epigram: “The empire of the seas belongs to the Eng - lish, that
of the land to the French, and that of the air to the Germans.” 61</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>She added, pertinently: “The extension of knowledge in modern times
serves to weaken the character when it is not strengthened by the habit
of business and the exercise of the will.” 82</p>
<p>She admired the German universities as then the best in the world.
But she deplored the German language, with its massing of consonants,
and she resented the length and structure of the German sentence, which
kept the decisive verb to the end, and so made interruption difficult ;
53 interruptions, she felt, were the life of conversation. She found too
little in Germany of the lively but polite debate characteristic of
Parisian salons; this, she thought, was due to lack of a national
capital which could bring the country’s wits to - gether , 54 and partly
to the German habit of sending the women away from the dinner table when
the men proposed to smoke and talk. “At Berlin the</p>
<p>Our guide had some trouble appreciating the nuances of German poetry,
and even of German prose; she was accustomed to French clarity and found
Teutonic depth a learned obscurity. But she took the side of the Germans
in the Romantic revolt against classical models and restraints. She
defined the classical style as one based upon the classics of ancient
Greece and Rome; Romantic literature, by contrast, rose out of Christian
theology and senti- ment, spread its roots in the poetry of the
troubadours, the legends of chiv- alry, &lt;he myths and ballads of the
early medieval north. Basically, perhaps, the division lay in the
classic subordination of the self to reality, and the Romantic
subordination of reality to the self.</p>
<p>For this reason Mme. de Stael welcomed German philosophy despite its
difficulty, for, like herself, it put the emphasis on the self; it saw
in con- sciousness a miracle greater than all the revolutions of
science. She rejected the psychology of Locke and Condillac, which
reduced all knowledge to sensations, and so made all ideas the effects
of external objects; this, she felt, led inevitably to materialism and
atheism. In one of the longest chapters in her book she attempted, with
modest disclaimers, to state the essence of Kant’s Critiques: they
restored the mind as an active participant in the con - ception of
reality; free will as an active element in the determination of ac-
tions; and moral conscience as a basic ingredient in morality. By these
the- orems, she felt, “K ant had with a firm hand separated the
different empires of the soul and the senses ,” 57 and so had
established the philosophical basis of Christianity as an effective
moral code.</p>
<p>Though she had made a shambles of the Sixth Commandment, Madame was
convinced that no civilization could survive without morality, and no
moral code could dispense with religious belief. Reasoning about
religion, she argued, is a treacherous procedure; “reason does not give
happiness in</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 299</p>
<p>place of that which it takes away.” 58 Religion is “the solace of
misery, the wealth of the poor, the future of the dying”; 59 here the
Emperor and the Baroness agreed. So she preferred the active
Protestantism of Germany to the pretended Catholicism of upper-class
France; she thrilled to the mighty hymns that resounded from German
throats in choirs, homes, and streets, and she frowned upon the French
way of watching the stock exchange and leaving the poor to attend to
God. 60 She had a good word to say for the Moravian Brethren. Her final
chapter was a plea for a mystic “enthusiasm” — an inner sense of an
omnipresent God.</p>
<p>All in all, allowing for limitations imposed by temperament and time,
On Germany was one of the outstanding books of the age, a heady leap
from Corinne to Kant; and Napoleon would have been wise to disarm it
with faint praise — as being excellent for a woman with no sympathy for
the prob- lems of government. She had strongly censured censorship, but
to deny the book to France was to illustrate and strengthen her case.
She had on many pages praised Germany at the expense of France, but she
had often praised France at the expense of Germany, and a hundred
passages revealed her love for her native and forbidden land. She had
dealt lightly with abstruse sub- jects, but she had aimed to interest a
wide audience in France, and thereby promote international
understanding. She asked for a cross-fertilization of cultures, which
would have helped Napoleon’s union of t he Rhenish Con- federation with
France. She wrote intelligently, sometimes wittily, 61 adorn- ing her
pages with illuminating perceptions and ideas. Ultimately she re- vealed
Germany to France, as Coleridge and Carlyle were soon to reveal it to
England. “This book,” said Goethe, “ought to be considered as a power -
ful engine which made a wide breach in that Chinese wall of antiquated
prejudice which divided the two countries; so that, beyond the Rhine,
and afterward beyond the Channel, we [Germans] became better known — a
fact that could not fail to procure for us a great influence over all
Western Eu- rope.” 02 She was “a good European.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Imperfect Victory</li>
</ol>
<p>Only another author can understand what it meant to Germaine de Stael
that the culminating production of her life and thought had to remain
hidden in the recesses of Coppet, apparently as dead as a child stifled
at birth. She discovered that her home was surrounded by agents of the
Emperor, that some of her servants had been bribed to report on her, and
that any friend who dared to visit her would be marked for imperial
revenge. Notables whose lives and fortunes had been saved by her during
the Revolution took care not to come near her now. 63</p>
<p>She had two consolations. In 181 1 she met Albert-Jean Rocca, then
close to twenty-three years old, a second lieutenant wounded in battle,
perma- nently lamed, and suffering from tuberculosis. He fell in love
with the heroic Germaine, who was then forty-five, physically
unprepossessing, mor- ally imperfect, intellectually brilliant, and not
without financial charm.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>“John” besieged her, and gave her a child. Germaine welcomed the new
love as defying and delaying old age. — The other solace was her hope
that if she could get to Sweden or England she might find a publisher
for her hidden masterpiece. But she could not get to Sweden through any
country under Napoleon’s power. She resolved to take her manus cript
secretly through Austria, then up through Russia to St. Petersburg, and
thence to Stockholm, where Prince Bernadotte would help her. It was no
easy matter for her to abandon the home that she had made famous, and
the grave of her mother, whom she could now forgive, and of the father
who still seemed to her to have been a political sage and a financial
saint. — On April 7, 1812, she gave birth to Rocca’s boy, who was sent
to a nurse for safekeeping. On May 23, 1812, eluding all spies, and
accompanied or followed by her daugh- ter Albertine, her two sons, her
old lover Schlegel and her new lover Rocca, she left for Vienna, hoping
to secure there a passport to Russia, and then to find her way to
St. Petersburg and a handsome, chivalrous, and liberal Czar. On June 22
Napoleon, with 500,000 men, crossed the Niemen into Russia, hoping to
find there a beaten and penitent Czar.</p>
<p>Germaine told the story of this trip in her Ten Years of Exile.
Contem- plating now that strange conjunction of wills and events, one
wonders at the courage that took this harassed woman through a thousand
obstacles and a supposedly barbarous people, to reach Zhitomir, in
Polish Russia, only eight days ahead of Napoleon’s troops. 64 She
hurried on to Kiev and thence to Moscow, where, challenging fate, she
lingered to visit the Kremlin, to hear the church music, to visit the
local leaders in science and literature. Then, a month before Napoleon’s
arrival, she left Moscow via Novgorod for St. Petersburg. Everywhere, in
the cities on her route, she was received as a distinguished ally in the
war against the invader. She flattered the Czar as the hope of European
liberalism. Together they planned to make Bernadotte king of France.</p>
<p>In September she reached Stockholm, where she helped to bring Berna-
dotte into the coalition against Napoleon. 65 After a stay of eight
months in Sweden, she crossed the sea to England. London acclaimed her
as the first woman of Europe; Byron and other notables came to pay their
respects, and she had no difficulty in arranging with Byron’s publisher,
John Murray, to issue her long-delayed volumes to the world (October,
1813). She remained in England while the Allies broke Napoleon at
Leipzig, marched into Paris, and put Louis XVIII on the throne. Then
(May 12, 1814) she hurried</p>
<p>across the Channel, restored her salon in Paris after ten years of
exile, and played host to dignitaries from a dozen lands — Alexander,
Wellington, Berna- dotte, Canning, Talleyrand, Lafayette. Constant
rejoined her, and Mme. Re- camier shone again. Germaine urged Alexander
to remember his liberal pronouncements; Alexander and Talleyrand
persuaded Louis XVIII to “grant” to his recaptured subjects a bicameral
constitution based on the British model; at last Montesquieu had his
way. But Madame did not like the word “grant”; she wanted the King to
recognize the sovereignty of the peo -</p>

<p>LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON</p>
<p>3 OI</p>
<p>pie. In July, 1814, she went back to Coppet, triumphant and proud,
but feeling the nearness of death.</p>
<p>Her adventures, her battles, even her victories, had brought her
amazing vitality close to exhaustion. Nevertheless she devotedly tended
the dying Rocca, arranged for the marriage of her daughter to the Due de
Broglie, and began to write her brilliant swan song, the 600-page
Considerations sur les principaux evenements de la Revolution frangaise.
The first part was a de- fense of Necker in all his policies; the second
excoriated the despotism of Napoleon. After his seizure of the
government his every move seemed to her an advance toward tyranny; and
his wars were props and excuses for abso- lutism. Before Stendhal, long
before Taine, she likened Napoleon “to the Italian despots of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.” 66 He had read and accepted
Machiavelli’s principles of government, without feeling a com - parable
love for his country. France was not really his fatherland; it was his
steppingstone. Religion was to him not the humble acceptance of a
supreme being but an instrument for the conquest of power. Men and women
were not souls but tools. 67 He was not sanguinary, but he was ever
indifferent to the carnage of victory. He had the brutality of a
condottiere, never the manners of a gentleman. And this crowned
vulgarian made himself the judge and censor of all speech and thought,
of the press that was the last refuge of liberty, and of the salons that
were citadels of the free mind of France. He was not the son of the
Revolution; but if he was, he was also its parricide. 68</p>
<p>When she learned that a plan was forming to kill the dethroned
Emperor, she hurried to notify his brother Joseph, and offered to go to
Elba and pro- tect her fallen foe; Napoleon sent her a word of
appreciation. When he returned from Elba, and regained France without a
blow, she could not help admire his courage: “I will not abandon myself
to declamations against Napoleon. He did what was natural for the
restoration of his throne, and his march from Cannes to Paris was one of
the greatest conceptions of audacity that can be cited from history.”
69</p>
<p>After Waterloo she withdrew at last from the political arena. She did
not relish the occupation of France by foreign troops, nor the rush of
the old nobility to regain land, wealth, and power. However, she was
glad to receive from Louis XVIII the twenty million francs owed to
Necker or his heirs for his loan to the French Treasury. On October 10,
1816, she was privately married to Rocca. On October 16, though both
were ailing, they went to Paris, and Germaine reopened her salon. It was
her final triumph. The most famous names in Paris came: Wellington from
England, Blucher and Wil- helm von Humboldt from Prussia, Canova from
Italy; there Chateaubriand began his idyl with Mme. Recamier. But
Germaine’s health was fast failing, and her disillusionment with the
Restoration grew as the royalists undertook to eliminate from the
political life of France every vestige of the Revolution. This was not
the dream that she had dreamed. Her Considerations defined despotism as
the union of both the executive and the legislative powers in</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>one person; and it insisted on a national assembly fully elected by a
sov- ereign people.</p>
<p>She did not live to see that book published. Her body, weakened with
passions, poisoned with drugs, winning sleep only through increasing
doses of opium, broke down in its attempt to support her mind. On
February 21, 1817, as she was mounting the stairs at a reception given
by one of Louis XVIII’s ministers, she swayed and fell, paralyzed by a
cerebral stroke. For three months she lay on her back, unable to move
but able to talk, and sensi- tive to a host of pains. At her urging her
daughter took over the role of hostess in the salon. “I have always been
the same, intense and sorrowful,” she told Chateaubriand. “I have loved
God, my father, and liberty.” 70 She died on July 14, 1817, the
anniversary of the Bastille. She was not yet fifty-one. Four years later
her great enemy died, not yet fifty-two.</p>
<p>We can agree with Macaulay that she was “the greatest woman of her
time,” 71 and the great est name in French literature between Rousseau
and Chateaubriand. Her work ranked higher in aim and range than in
literary art, and her thought was more pervasive than profound. She
shared many qualities with her chosen foe: forceful personality, courage
against odds, domineering spirit, pride of power, and intolerance of
dissent; but she lacked his realistic mind, and her imagination, as seen
in her novels, was ro- mantically childish compared with the reach of
his political dreams. Let him sum her up from the perspective of his
island isolation: “The home of Madame de Stael became a veritable
arsenal against me. To her came many to be armed as her knights in her
war…. And yet, after all, it is only true to say that she was a woman of
very great talent, of high distinc- tion, and of great strength of
character. She will endure.” 72</p>

<li>BENJAMIN CONSTANT: 1 767 — 1 8 1 6</li>
</ol>
<p>There were two Constants in Napoleon’s stormy life: Very Constant,
his valet, who wrote about the great dictator’s private life, voluminous
memoirs disproving an old adage; and Benjamin Constant de Rebecque, who,
born in Switzerland, educated in a dozen cities, and finally embattled
in France, so littered his life with unpaid debts, discarded mistresses,
and political somer- saults that it would hardly be profitable to dally
with him here had he not come close to history in many frays, been loved
to distraction by notable women, and been able to describe his faults
with such eloquence, subtlety, and impartiality as might help us to
understand our own.</p>
<p>He chronicled his first twenty years of life in a Cahier rouge or
Red</p>
<p>Notebook; the next twenty in a short novel, Adolphe ; and the years
1804-16 in a Journal intime that ranges from Paris to Coppet to Weimar
to London with arresting snatches of history, literature, psychology,
and philosophy. Only Adolphe was published in his lifetime (London,
1816); the Journal remained in manuscript till 1887, the Cahier till
1907; these scattered mem- bers, with a thousand contemporary
references, constitute Constant today.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 303</p>
<p>He came of a titled Swiss-German family that traced its pedigree
through 800 years. We need go back no further than his father, who was
so occupied with his own sins that he had little time left to supervise
his son’s. Baron Arnold-Juste Constant de Rebecque was an officer in a
Swiss regiment serv- ing the States-General of the Netherlands. He was
handsome, well read, a friend of Voltaire. Early in 1767 he married
Henriette de Chandieu, of French-Huguenot extraction. She was then
twenty-five, he was forty. On October 25, at Lausanne, she gave birth to
Benjamin; a week later she died, the first of many women who suffered
from his irregularities. The father entrusted the boy to various tutors,
carelessly chosen. One tried by beatings and fondlings to make the boy
an infant prodigy in Greek. When the beatings endangered Benjamin’s
health he was transferred to a second tutor, who took him to a brothel
in Brussels. His third tutor gave him a good knowledge of music, and,
for the rest, relied on him to educate himself through reading. Benjamin
read eight or ten hours a day, permanently in- juring his eyes and his
faith. 78 He spent a year at the University of Erlangen; then he was
transferred to Edinburgh, where he felt the final flurry of the Scottish
Enlightenment; but there too he took to gambling, which became second
only to sex in disordering his life. After adventures in Paris and
Brussels he settled in Switzerland, and began to write a history of
religion, with a view to demonstrating the superiority of paganism to
Christianity.</p>
<p>He passed from woman to woman, from casino to casino, until at last
his father arranged (1785) to have him live in Paris with the family of
Jean- Baptiste Suard, a literary critic of learning and goodwill.</p>
<p>I was received with full acceptance by his set. My wit, which at that
time entirely lacked solidity and accuracy, had an amusingly
epigrammatic turn; my learning — which was very desultory but superior
to that of most of the men of letters of the rising generation — and the
originality of my character, all seemed novel and interesting…. When I
remember the kind of things I used to say at that time, and the
convinced disdain that I showed toward everyone, I am at a loss to know
how I could have been tolerated. 74</p>
<p>In 1787 he met “the first woman of superior intelligence whom I had
hitherto known.” “Zelide”— i.e., Isabella van Tuyll — had been the
difficult piece de resistance in Boswell’s Holland days. She had
rejected him and others to marry her brother’s tutor, and was now living
with him, in re- signed discontent, in the town of Colombier near the
Lake of Neuchatel. When Constant came upon her she was in Paris seeing
her novel Caliste through the press. She was forty-seven, but she had
for the nineteen-year- old philanderer the charm of a woman still
physically stimulating and intellectually brilliant and blase to a
degree that made his own proud sophistication seem sophomorically
juvenile. “I still remember with emotion the days and nights we spent
together, drinking tea, and talking with in- exhaustible ardor on every
possible subject.” When she returned to Colom - bier he took up his own
dwelling in nearby Lausanne. Her husband</p>
<p>mistakenly believed that the disparity of their ages would limit
Zelide and Constant to friendship. She set herself zealously to
educating Benjamin in</p>
<p>304 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>he wiles of women and the lies of men. “We intoxicated one another
with our jests and our scorn of the human race.” 75</p>
<p>His father interrupted this semi-intellectual diversion by sending
him to Brunswick to serve as a court functionary to the Duke who was
soon to lead an army against the French Revolution. Between ceremonies
he fell into the tender trap of the Baroness Wilhelmina von Cramm,
married her (May 8, 1789), found husband-ry duller than philandering,
concluded that Minna loved “cats, dogs, birds, friends, and a lover”
more than her lawful mate, and sued for divorce. Feeling heart-free,, he
developed a passion for Charlotte von Hardenberg, wife of Baron von
Marenholz. She refused Benjamin the consolation of adultery, but offered
to marry him as soon as she could divorce the Baron. Frightened by the
thought of another marriage, Constant fled to Lausanne (1793) and
Colombier, where Zelide resumed his education. He was now twenty-six
years old, and she felt that he should sacrifice the zest of variety for
rest in unity. She told him, “If I knew a young and robust person who
would love you as much as I do, and who is no more stupid than I am, I
would have the generosity to say, ‘Go to her!’” 70 To her surprise and
indignation, he soon found a young and robust person.</p>
<p>On September 28, 1794, on the road between Nyon and Coppet, Benjamin
met Germaine de Stael, aged twenty-eight, jumped into her carriage, and
began a fifteen-year comedy of vows, tears, and words. He had never
known a woman with an intellect so enriched, a will so strong, passions
and senti- ments stronger still. Against these powers he was all
weakness, for he had lost character through a permissive and fragmented
youth, and had reduced his natural vitality through physiological
campaigns without dignity or growth. Here too his ready triumph was a
defeat, for though she accepted him as a lover, and allowed him to
believe that he had fathered Albertine, she persuaded him to sign with
her, at an unknown date, an oath of al- legiance which, aided by his
debts to her, kept him in psychological bondage even after both had
taken other mates to their beds.</p>
<p>We promise to consecrate our lives to each other; we declare that we
regard ourselves as indissolubly bound to each other; that we will share
forever, and in every respect, a common destiny; that we will never
enter into any other bond; and that we shall strengthen the bonds now
uniting us as soon as lies within our powers.</p>
<p>I declare that I am entering into this engagement with a sincere
heart, that 1 know nothing on earth as worthy of love as Madame de
Stael, that 1 have been the happiest of men during the four months I
have spent with her, and that I regard it as the greatest happiness in
my life to be able to make her happy in her youth, to grow old peaceably
by her side, and to reach my term together with the soul that
understands me, and without whose presence life on this earth would hold
no more interest for me.</p>
<p>Benjamin Constant 77</p>
<p>He followed her to Paris in 1795, merged his politics with hers,
supported the Directory, accepted Napoleon’s coup d’etat as necessitated
by the condi - tion of France, and served as spokesman for her as well
as himself when, nominated by Napoleon, he became a member of the
Tribunate. But as</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 305</p>
<p>soon as the First Consul gave signs of desiring absolute power, the
lovers jointly opposed him; she in her salon, he in his maiden speech
(January 5,</p>
<p>1800), which demanded the right of the Tribunate to unshackled
discus- sion. He won reputation as a forceful orator, but was marked for
replace- ment as soon as the time should come (in 1 802 ) for the
Tribunate’s periodic cleansing. When the lovers nevertheless carried on
their war Napoleon banished them from Paris.</p>
<p>Constant went with her to Coppet, though their relations had
apparently cooled to a platonic calm. “I need women,” he told himself,
“and Germaine is not sensual.” 78 He offered to marry her; she refused,
saying that this would sacrifice her rank and her da ughter’s marital
prospects. In September, 1802, she fell in love with Camille Jordan, and
invited him to accompany her to Italy, all expenses paid, vowing to
“forget everything with you, whom I love profoundly.” 79 Jordan refused.
In April, 1803, Consta nt left Coppet for an estate he had bought near
Mafliers, some thirty miles from Paris. In the fall, Germaine, risking
Napoleon’s ire, moved with her family to a country house in Mafliers.
When Napoleon heard of this he bade her obey his order of banishment to
120 miles from Paris. She preferred to visit Ger- many. Constant,
resenting the Consul’s severity and touched by Germaine’s grief, decided
to accompany her.</p>
<p>He helped her and her children through the hardships of travel,
rejoiced when he reached Weimar, and settled down there to work on his
history of religion. On January 22, 1804, he began to keep a Journal
intime with a buoyant entry: “I have just arrived in Weimar, I count on
remaining some time, for there I shall find libraries, serious
conversation after my taste, and, above all, peace for my work.” 80 Some
further entries reveal his mental growth:</p>
<p>January 23: I am working little and badly, but in revenge I have seen
Goethe! Finesse, pride, physical sensitivity to the point of suffering;
a remark- able spirit, a fine countenance, a figure slightly
deteriorated…. After dinner I chat with Wieland — a French soul, cold
like a philosopher, light like a poet…. Herder is like a warm, soft bed,
where one has agreeable dreams….</p>
<p>January 27: Johannes von Muller [the Swiss historian] has explained
to me his plan for a universal history…. [With him] an interesting
question arose: the creation or noncreation of the world. According to
how we decide this question the course of the human race will appear
diametrically opposite: if creation, deterioration; if no creation,
amelioration….</p>
<p>February 12: Have reread Goethe’s Faust [Part I]. It is in derisio n
of man- kind and all scientists. The Germans find in it an unprecedented
profundity, but as for me, I prefer Candide….</p>
<p>February 26: A visit to Goethe….</p>
<p>February 27: An evening with Schiller….</p>
<p>February 28: Supper with Schiller and Goethe. I know no one in the
world who has so much humor [ gaiete ], refinement, force, and range of
spirit as Goethe.</p>
<p>February 29:… I depart tomorrow for Leipzig, and I do not leave
Weimar without sadness. I have passed here three months very pleasantly:
I have studied, lived secure, suffered little; I do not ask for
more….</p>
<p>306</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>March 3: I visit the Museum at Leipzig…. The library has 80,000 vol-
umes…. Why should I not remain here and work?…</p>
<p>March 10: I have bought six louis [approximately 50.00] of German
books. 81</p>
<p>He left Mme. de Stael at Leipzig and made his way down to Lausanne to
visit with his relatives. He arrived just in ti me to learn that
Germaine’s father had died — “this good Monsieur Necker, so noble, so
affectionate, so pure. He loved me. Who now will guide his daughter?” 82
He rushed back to Germany, hoping to break the news to her gently; he
knew that this loss would overwhelm her. He came back with her to
Coppet, and stayed with her till she had raised her head again.</p>
<p>She needed him most in those days when he was longing to part from
her, to be free to pursue his own political and personal career without
tying it to her interest. He felt that he had ruined his political
prospects by becoming a lieutenant in her war against Napoleon. In
April, 1806, his diary analyzed his malady of will: “I always incline to
break with Madame de Stael, but every time I feel this way, the next
morning finds me in a contrary mood. Meanwhile her impetuosities and
imprudences keep me in torment and perpetual danger. We must part… ; it
is my sole chance for a peaceful life.” 83 A month later his journal
records: “In the evening a terrible scene - horrible, senseless,
atrocious words. She is mad or I am crazy. How will it end?” 84</p>
<p>Like so many authors unable to handle life, he took refuge in telling
his side of the story in a fiction carefully disguised but transparently
confes- sional. Hot with resentment of Germaine’s domination and
reproaches, an - gry at his own weak-willed hesitations, he wrote in
fifteen days (January,</p>
<ol start="1807" type="1">
<li>and one hundred pages the first psychological novel of the
nineteenth century, more probing and subtle than most, and merciless to
both woman and man.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adolphe traced the fictional author’s aimless youth, his fragmentary
education, his hasty and superficial amours, his eager reading — which
re- placed his faith with a cynicism that gnawed at the meaninglessness
of his life. He brought his odyssey of irresponsible loves to a
climactic catastrophe in the story of Ellenore, a noblewoman who had
sacrificed home, honor, and future to be the mistress of Count P —.
Adolphe notes the way in which society — founding its order and
stability on laws and customs check- ing unsocial desires — punishes
with gossip and contumely the woman (much less the man) who violates
those protective norms. His pity for the ostra- cized Ellenore, his
admiration for her courage, turn easily into love, or perhaps to the
secret desire for one more conquest to sustain his pride. Just when his
ardor is cooling to controllability she yields to him, leaves the Count
and his money, takes a modest apartment, and tries to live on Adolphe’s
visits and funds. His interest in the surrendered citadel declines as
her devotion mounts. He tries to break away from her; she reproaches
him; finally they quarrel and part. She leaves him, and wastes away
in</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 307</p>
<p>poverty and lack of will to live. He rejoins her only to have her die
in his arms.</p>
<p>Constant had sought to conceal any key that would unveil his
fictional characters as denizens of Coppet; he had made his heroine
Polish and sub- missive, and had made her die in despair. Nevertheless
all who became acquainted with the book and its author identified him
with Adolphe, and Mme. de Stael with Ellenore. Constant refrained for
nine years from pub- lishing his book, but (vanity dulling caution) he
read portions — sometimes all — of the manuscript to friends, and at
last to Germaine herself, who fainted</p>
<p>Constant had received some passing strength by the return, into his
life, of Charlotte von Hardenberg. She had divorced her first husband,
and was tiring of the second, the Vicomte du Tertre; now she resumed her
inter- rupted liaison with Constant. They were married on June 5, 1808,
but when Benjamin, to quiet Mme. de Stael, returned to servitude at
Coppet, Charlotte went back to Germany. Not till Madame discovered a new
lover in John Rocca ( 1 8 1 1 ) did Constant feel free. He went with
Charlotte to live near Gottingen, and, helped by the university library,
renewed his labor on his history of religion. The next two years were
probably the happiest in his life.</p>
<p>But happiness was uncongenial to him. When (January, 1813) he heard
from the Comte de Narbonne a firsthand story of Napoleon’s disaster in
Russia, and sensed the nearness of Napoleon’s fall, his old restlessness
re - turned. “Must I always be a spectator?” he asked himself in his
journal. As the victorious Allies drove Napoleon back to the Rhine,
Constant went to Hanover, met Bernadotte there, and was persuaded by him
to write a pamphlet, Esprit de conquete, ascribing the collapse of
France to Napoleon’s despotism. Published in Hanover in January, 1814,
at the height of the Allied push into France, it made him persona grata
with the Allied leaders, and he followed their armies into Paris (April,
1814) in hopes of a personal restora- tion.</p>
<p>He visited Mme. de Stael’s revived salon, and found that she had lost
all interest in him. Since Charlotte was still in Germany, he announced
in his journal (August 31, 1814) that he had fallen in love with Mme.
Recamier, whose strategy of trembling but impregnable virginity he had
long ridi- culed. He confided to the Due de Broglie that he had tried to
sell his soul to the Devil in exchange for the body of Juliette
Recamier. 85 As she had been an ardent supporter of the Bourbons, she
feared for her safety when she learned that Napoleon had escaped from
Elba and had landed at Cannes. She inspired Constant to publish in the
Journal de Paris (March 6, 1815) a call to the people of France to rise
against the “Usurper.” “Napoleon promises peace, but his very name is a
signal for war. He promises victory; yet three times — in Egypt, Spain,
and Russia — he deserted his armies like a coward.” 86 La Recamier had
lit in the inflammable Constant a fire that seemed to be burning all
bridges behind him. On March 19 he proclaimed</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>in the Journal des debats that he was ready to die for the restored
King. That night Louis XVIII fled to Ghent; the next day Napoleon
entered</p>
<p>Paris; Constant hid in the United States Embassy. Napoleon issued a
general amnesty; Constant emerged from hiding; on March 30 Joseph
Bonaparte assured him that the Emperor was in a forgiving mood. On April
14 Na- poleon received him and asked him to draft a liberal
constitution. Napoleon revised the draft considerably, and then
proclaimed it as the new charter of the French government. Constant was
dizzy with glory.</p>
<p>On June 20, while he was reading Adolphe to Queen Hortense, the Due
de Rovigo entered to tell her that Napoleon had been defeated at
Waterloo two days before. On July 8 Louis returned to the Tuileries;
Constant sent him a humble apology; the King, judging him to be a
wayward irresponsible adolescent who wrote excellent French, issued a
pardon that surprised every- one. All Paris shunned Constant, and spun
puns around his name. He wrote to Mme. Recamier forgiving her for having
ruined “my career, my future, my reputation, and my happiness.” 87 In
October he left for Brussels, where he rejoined the patient Charlotte.
Early in 1816 they crossed to England, where he had Adolphe published.
In September he returned with his wife to Paris, plunged into politics,
and began a new career.</p>

</ol>

<li>Youth</li>
</ol>
<p>For his French contemporaries Fran§ois-Rene de Chateaubriand was the
greatest writer of the time —’ “le plus illustre [said Sainte -Beuve in
1849] de nos ecrivains modernes”; 88 and another paragon of literary
learning, Emile Faguet, wrote, about 1887 (forgetting Voltaire):
“Chateaubriand is the greatest date in the history of French literature
since the Pleiade” (c. 1550); 89 nearness lends enchantment to the view.
Certainly his reign over French letters had been equaled only by
Voltaire’s. His ascendancy marked the triumph of religion over
philosophy, just as Voltaire’s had meant the triumph of philosophy over
religion; and he lived long enough to see unfaith reborn. So one mood,
passionately sustained, wears out its welcome, begets its opposite, and
is revived, across the generations, through the em- battled immoderation
of mankind.</p>
<p>“My life and drama,” he wrote, “is divided into three acts. From
my</p>
<p>early youth until 1800 I was a soldier and traveler; from 1800 till
1814, under the Consulate and the Empire, my life was devoted to
literature; from the Restoration to the present day [1833] my life has
been political.” 90 There would be a fourth and subsiding act (1834-48),
in which the triple hero was to be a living but fragile memory,
sustained by kindly women, but fading in the mist of time.</p>
<p>“My name was first written Brien,… then Briand… About the</p>
<p>beginning of the eleventh century the Briens gave their name to an
important</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 309</p>
<p>chateau in Brittany, and this chateau became the seat of the barony
of Chateaubriand.” 91 When the proud family lost almost everything but
its chateau and its pride, the father went to America, and made a modest
for- tune. Returning, he married Apolline de Bedee, who gave him so many
children that he withdrew into a somber introversion which passed down
to his last and only remembered son. The mother soothed her labors and
illnesses with an intense piety. Four of her children died before Rene
was born, September 4, 1768, at St.-Malo, on the Channel coast. He later
re- marked that “after being born oneself, I know no greater misfortune
than that of giving birth to a human being.” 92 His sister Lucile, ever
ailing, mingled her mal-de-vie with his in an intimacy so intense that
it left them cold to marriage. The fog coming from the Channel, and the
waves that beat upon their island and home added to their somber spirit,
but became dear in memory.</p>
<p>When he was nine the family moved to an estate in Combourg, which
brought with it the title of comte, and made Rene a vicomte. Now he was
sent to a school at nearby Dol, taught by priests who, at his mother’s
urging, sought to inspire in him a vocation to the priesthood. They gave
him a good grounding in the classics; soon he was making his own
translations from Homer and Xenophon. “In my third year at Dol… chance
put into my hands… an unexpurgated Horace. I obtained insight into…
charms of an unknown nature in a sex in which I had seen only a mother
and sisters…. My terror of the infernal shades… affected me both morally
and physically. I continued, in my innocence, to fight against the
storms of a premature passion and the terrors of superstition.” 93 His
sexual energy, without any known contact with the other sex, developed
in him an image of an idealized woman, to whom he became mystically
devoted with an intensity that may have diverted him from a normal
development.</p>
<p>As the time for his First Communion neared, he feared to admit his
secret agitations to his confessor. When he found courage to do so, and
the kindly priest gave him comfort and absolution, he felt “the joy of
the angels.” “The next day… I was admitted to the sublime and moving
ceremony which I vainly endeavored to describe in Le Genie du
christianisme…. The Real Presence of the Victim in the Blessed Sacrament
on the altar was as manifest to me as my mother’s presence by my side….
I felt as though a light had been kindled within me. I trembled with
venerati on.” 94 Three months later he left the College de Dol. “The
memory of these obscure teachers will always be dear to me.” 95</p>
<p>That exaltation subsided as his reading raised questions to his
faith. He confessed to his parents that he felt no vocation to the
priesthood. At seven- teen he was sent for two years to the College de
Rennes to fit him for ap- pointment to the Naval Guard at Brest. In
1788, aged twenty, he reported there for tests, but the prospects of
life and discipline in the French Navy so frightened him that he
returned to his parents at Combourg, and, perhaps to quiet their
reproaches, agreed to enter the College de Dinan and prepare for the
priesthood; “the truth is that I was only trying to gain time, for I</p>
<p>3 10</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>did not know what I wanted.” 96 Finally he joined the Army as a
commis - sioned officer. He was presented to Louis XVI, hunted with him,
and saw the taking of the Bastille; he sympathized with the Revolution
until, in</p>
<p>1790, it abolished all ranks, titles, and feudal rights. When his
regiment voted to join the Revolutionary Army he resigned his
commission, and — fortified by a modest income left him at his father’s
death— he left on April 4, 1791, for the United States. He announced
that he would try to find a northwest passage through Arctic America. “I
was an ardent freethinker at the time.” 97</p>
<p>He reached Baltimore July 11, 1791, drove to Philadelphia, dined with
President Washington, amused him with his grandiose plans, made his way
to Albany, hired a guide, bought two horses, and rode proudly westward.
He marveled at the grandeur of the scenery, which mingled mountains,
lakes, and streams under a summer sun. He reveled in these open spaces
and their natural art, as a refuge from civilization and its cares. He
recorded his experiences in a journal which he later polished and
published as Voyage en Amerique , and which already displayed the
scented beauty of his style:</p>

It did not matter, for literature, that Chateaubriand had lost his
religious faith, or that many of his descriptions were imaginary rather
than factual, or that a hundred inaccuracies, exaggerations, or
impossibilities were soon discov- ered in his Voyage by French or
American critics; 99 here was a prose that set aflutter all female —
many male — breasts; not since Rousseau or Bernardin de Saint-Pierre had
French prose been so colorful, or nature so splendid, or civilization so
absurd. All that the Romantic movement now awaited was a persuasive
presentation of the American Indian as the lord of Eden and wisdom, and
a panorama of religion as the mother of morals, art, and salva- tion.
Chateaubriand would soon provide the one in Atala and Rene, the other in
The Genius of Christianity.</p>
<p>The poet-explorer rode on through New York State, received
hospitality from some Onondaga Indians, slept primitively on Mother
Earth near Ni- agara, and heard the muffled roar of the falls. The next
day, standing hyp- notized by the river that hurrie d to its end, “I had
an involuntary longing to throw myself in.” 100 Eager to see the falls
from below, he clambered down a rocky slope, lost his footing, broke an
arm, and was hoisted to safety by Indians. Sobered, he surrendered his
dream of a northwest passage, turned south, and reached the Ohio. At
this point his narrative becomes dubious. Fie tells us that he followed
the Ohio to the Mississippi, this to the Gulf of Mexico, then, over a
thousand miles and a hundred mountains, to Florida. Critics, comparing
distances, conveyances, and time, have judged his story incredible, and
have branded his description of fauna and flora as quite unlike the
landscapes and vegetation of those regions a hundred years later; 101
however, a century could have drastically changed the wildlife, and
even, through cultivation and mining, the contour of the earth.</p>
<p>After a stay with the Seminole Indians, Chateaubriand made his way
northwest to Chillicothe, in what is now Illinois. There he saw in an
English journ al news of Louis XVI’s flight to Varennes (June 22, 1791).
He wor - ried that the captured King would now be daily in danger of his
life. “I said to myself, ‘Go back to France,’ and abruptly brought my
travels to a close.” 102 On January 2, 1792, he reached France after an
absence of nine months. He was still but twenty-three.</p>

<p>He had exhausted nearly all his funds, and remained uncertain and
inse- cure in a country hostile to viscounts and moving toward war and
Septem- ber Massacres. His sisters advised him to marry money, and found
for him a moderately dowered bride, Celeste Buisson de La Vigne, aged
seventeen. They married (February 21, 1792). The modest Celeste remained
loyal to him through all his vicissitudes and mistresses, and through
his decade of conflict with Napoleon, whom she admired; and after many
years he learned to love her. They went to live in Paris, near his
sisters Lucile and Julie. Part</p>

<p>of his wife’s fortune, invested in church securities, was lost in the
confisca - tion of ecclesiastical property by the revolutionary
government; part of it Rene gambled away in the casinos.</p>
<p>On April 20 the Legislative Assembly declared war upon Austria.
French emigres formed a regiment to join Austria in overthrowing the
Revolution. Chateaubriand, though not quite certain that he desired
this, felt bound to join his fellow nobles. Leaving wife and sisters in
a Paris that would soon imprison and then massacre hundreds of the
aristocracy, he rushed to Coblenz, enrolled in the emigre army, and
shared in the abortive siege of Thionville (September 1, 1792); he was
wounded in the thigh, and was honorably discharged. Unable to get back
through mobilized France to his wife, he made his way, mostly on foot,
to Ostend, found passage to the island of Jersey, was nursed back to
health by an uncle, and, in May, 1793, crossed to England.</p>
<p>There h e learned the ways of poverty, and bore them well despite
“the sickly temperament to which I was subject, and the romantic notions
of freedom which I cherished.” 103 He refused the allowance offered to
emigre nobles by the British government; he survived by teaching French
privately and in a boarding school. He fell in love with a pupil,
Charlotte Ives; she returned his affection; her parents proposed that he
marry Charlotte; he had to confess that he already had a wife. Meanwhile
his wife, his mother, and his sisters had been imprisoned in France; his
elder brother, with his wife and her heroic grandfather Malesherbes,
were guillotined (April 22, 1794); his own wife and his sisters were not

<p>Lucile had often noted his facility with words, and had urged him to
be a writer. During these years in England he began a vast prose epic,
Les Natchez, into whose 2,383 pages he poured his romantic dreams and
his idealization of the American Indian. Anxious to win fame as a
philosopher, he published in London (1797) an Essai historique,
politique, et moral sur les revolutions anciennes et modernes. This was
a remarkable performance for a youth of twenty-nine; poor in
organization, rich in garnered ideas. Revolu- tions, Chateaubriand
argued, are periodic outbursts following always the same curve from
rebellion through chaos to dictatorship. So the Greeks deposed their
kings, established republics, and then submitted to Alexander; the
Romans deposed their king, established a republic, and then submitted to
the Caesars; 104 here, two years before the 18th Brumaire, was Chateau-
briand’s forecast of Napoleon. History is a circle, or an enlarged
repetition</p>

<p>hen, will replace the Christian? Probably none (the young skeptic
con- cludes). Intellectual and political turmoil will undermine European
civiliza- tion, and return it to the barbarism from which it emerged;
peoples now savage will rise to civilization, go through successive
grandeurs ana revolu- tions, and sink into barbarism in their turn.
105</p>
<p>The book made Chateaubriand famous in emigre circles, but shocked
those who felt that aristocracy and religion must stand together or die
divided. These criticisms left their mark on Chateaubriand, whose later
works were largely an apology for this one; but he was now deeply moved
by a letter sent him from France July i , 1 798, by his sister
Julie:</p>
<p>My friend, we have just lost the best of mothers…. If you knew how
many tears your errors have drawn from our honorable mother, and how
deplorable these errors seem to all who make profession not merely of
piety but of reason — if you knew this pledge it would help to open your
eyes, to make you give up writing; and if a Heaven touched by our
prayers should permit our reunion, you would find, among us, all the
happiness that we can taste on earth. 106</p>
<p>When Chateaubriand received this letter it was accompanied by another
to the effect that this sister Julie too had died. In the preface to he
Genie du christianisme he ascribed to these messages the complete change
displayed by the later book: “These two voices from the tomb, this death
serving to</p>
<p>interpret death, were a blow to me; I became a Christian…. I wept,
and I believed.”</p>
<p>So sudden and dramatic a change invited skepticism, but in a less
than literal sense it could be sincere. Probably Chateaubriand, in whom
the philosopher was never distinct from the poet, ascribed to a moment,
as by a figure of speech, the process by which he passed from unbelief
to a view of Christianity as, first, beautiful, then morally beneficent,
finally deserving, despite its faults, of private sympathy and public
support. He was moved, in the last years of the dying century, by
letters from his friend Louis de Fontanes, describing the moral
disintegration then corroding France, and the rising desire of the
people to return to their churches and their priests. Soon, in Fontanes’
judgment, this hunger would compel a restoration of Catholic
worship.</p>
<p>Chateaubriand resolved to be the voice of that movement. He would
write a defense of Christianity in terms not of science and philosophy
but of morals and art. No matter if those fascinating stories that were
told us in our youth were legends rather than history; they entranced
and inspired us, and in some measure reconciled us to those Hebraic
Commandments upon which our social order, and therefore Christian
civilization, had been built. Would it not be the greatest of crimes to
take from the people the beliefs that had helped them to control their
unsocial impulses and to bear injustice, evil, suffering, and the
fatality of death? So Chateaubriand, in his final Memoires, expressed
both his doubts and his faith: “My spirit is inclined to believe in
nothing, not even in myself, to disdain everything — grandeur, miseries,
peoples, and kings; nevertheless it is dominated by an instinct of</p>
<p>314 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>reason that commands it to submit to everything evidently beautiful:
re- ligion, justice, humanity, equality, liberty, glory.” 107</p>
<p>Early in 1800 Fontanes invited Chateaubriand to return to France.</p>
<p>Fontanes was persona grata with the First Consul, and would see to it
that the young emigre should not be harmed. Napoleon was already
thinking of restoring Catholicism; a good book on the virtues of
Christianity might help him meet the inevitable gibes of the
Jacobins.</p>
<p>On May 16, 1800, Chateaubriand rejoined his wife and Lucile in Paris.
Fontanes introduced him to a literary circle that gathered in the home
of the frail but beautiful Comtesse Pauline de Beaumont, daughter of
Comte Armand-Marc de Montmorin, once minister of foreign affairs under
Louis XVI, and then guillotined. Soon she became Chateaubriand’s
mistress. It was in her country house, and under her prodding, that he
finished he Genie. He did not think the time ripe for the complete
publication of a book so contrary to the skepticism prevailing in
intellectual circles; but in 1801 he offered Paris a 100-page extract
from it as an unpretentious idyl of Christian virtue and romantic love.
It made him at once the talk of literate France, the idol of the women,
and the favorite son of the reviving Church.</p>
<p>He called it Atala, or The Loves of Two Savages in the Desert.
The</p>
<p>initial scene is in Louisiana as peopled by the Natchez Indians; the
narrator is the blind old chieftain Chactas. He tells how, in his youth,
he was captured by a hostile tribe, and was sentenced to be burned to
death, but was saved by the Indian maid Atala. They flee together
through marshes and forests, over mountains and streams; they fall in
love by force of propinquity and through dangers shared; he seeks — she
refuses — consummation, having pledged lifelong virginity to her dying
mother. They meet an old mission- ary, who supports her piety by
satirizing love as a form of inebriation, and marriage as a fate worse
than death. 108 Torn (like history) between religion and sex, Atala
solves her dilemma by taking poison. Chactas is desolate, but the
missionary explains that death is a blessed release from life:</p>
<p>“Despite so many days gathered on my head,… I have never met a man
who had not been deceived by dreams of happiness, no heart that did not
hold a hidden wound. The spirit apparently most serene resembles the
natural wells of Florida’s savannas: their surface seems calm and pure,
but when you see to the bottom… you perceive a large crocodile, which
the well nourishes with its waters.” 109</p>
<p>Chateaubriand’s description of Atala’s funeral— priest and pagan
mingling their hands to cover her corpse with the soil — became a famous
passage in’ the literature of romance; it inspired also one of the great
paintings of the Napoleonic period — The Burial of Atala, with which
Girodet-Trioson brought half of Paris to tears in 1808. But the
classical tradition was too strong in the France of 1801 to win for the
tale the full acclaim of critics. Many of them smiled at the purple
passages, and the ancient use of love, religion, and death to stir
hearts broken or young, and the conscription of nature to serve, with
her various moods, as an obbligato to human joys and</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 315</p>
<p>woes. But others praised — and a multitude of readers enjoyed — the
simple words and quiet music of the style; the sounds, forms, and colors
of the fauna and flora; the mountains, forests, and streams that
supplied a living background to the tale. The mood of France was ready
to hear a good word for religion and chastity. Napoleon was planning a
reconciliation with the Church. It seemed a good time to publish Le
Genie du christianisme.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Genius of Christianity</li>
</ol>
<p>The book appeared in five volumes on April 14, 1802, in the same week
that saw the promulgation of the Concordat. “As far as I can judge,”
wrote</p>
<p>The genie of the title did not quite mean genius, though it meant
that too. It meant the distinctive character, the inherent creative
spirit, of the religion that had begotten and nurtured the civilization
of postclassical Europe. Chateaubriand proposed to annul the eighteenth-
century Enlightenment by showing, in Christianity, such understanding
tenderness toward human needs and griefs, such multifarious inspiration
to art, and such powerful supports to moral character and social order,
that all questions as to the credibility of the Church’s dogmas and
traditions became of minor impor - tance. The real question should be:
Is Christianity an immeasurable, insep- arable, and indispensable
support to Western civilization?</p>
<p>A more logical mind than Chateaubriand’s might have begun with a</p>
<p>picture of the moral, social, and political deterioration of that
Revolutionary France which had divorced itself from Catholic
Christianity. But Chateau- briand was a man of feeling and sentiment,
and probably he was right in assuming that most of the French, of either
sex, were more like him than like Voltaire and the other philo sophes
who had labored so ardently to “crush the infamy” of an authoritarian
religion. He called h imself an anti-philo- sophe; he carried far beyond
Rousseau the reaction against rationalism, and he reproved Mme. de Stael
for defending the Enlightenment. So he began with an appeal to feeling,
and left reason to fall in line after feeling had led the way.</p>
<p>He proclaimed at the outset his belief in the fundamental mystery of
Catholic doctrine, the Trinity: God as the Father creating, God as the
Son redeeming, God as the Holy Spirit enlightening and sanctifying. One
must not worry here about credibility; the important thing is that
without a belief in an intelligent God, life becomes a merciless
struggle, sin and failure become unforgivable, marriage becomes a
fragile and precarious association, old age a somber disintegration,
death an obscene but inescapable agony. The sacraments of the Church —
baptism, confession, Communion, confirmation, matrimony, extreme unction
(deathbed anointment), and sacerdotal ordina-</p>
<p>3 i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>ion — transformed the chapters in our painful growth and ignominious
decay into advancing stages of spiritual development, each deepened with
priestly guidance and solemn ceremony, and strengthening the
infinitesimal indi- vidual with membership in a powerful and confident
community of believers in a redeeming and lovable Christ, a sinless and
interceding Mother, a wise, omnipotent, watchful, punishing, forgiving,
and rewarding God. With that faith man is redeemed from the greatest
curse of all — to be meaningless in a meaningless world.</p>
<p>Chateaubriand proceeded to contrast the virtues recommended by
the</p>
<p>E philosophers with those taught by Christianity: on the one hand</p>
<p>ide, temperance, and prudence — all directed toward individual
ad-</p>
<p>vancement; on the other, faith, hope, and charity — a creed that
ennobled life, strengthened the social bond, and made death a
resurrection. He compared the philosopher’s view of history as the
struggle and defeat of individuals and groups with the Christian view of
history as the effort of man to over- come the sinfulness original to
his nature and to achieve a widening caritas. Better to believe that the
heavens declare the glory of God than that they are accidental
accumulations of rock and dust, persistent but senseless, beau- tiful
but dumb. And how can we contemplate the loveliness of most birds and
many quadrupeds without feeling that some divinity lurks in their
resilient growth and their enchanting forms?</p>
<p>As for morality, the matter seemed to Chateaubriand painfully clear:
our moral code must be sanctioned by God, or it will collapse against
the nature of man. No code of confessedly human origin will carry
sufficient authority to control the unsocial instincts of men; the fear
of God is the beginning of civilization, and the love of God is the goal
of morality. More- over, that fear and love must be handed down,
generation after generation, by parents, educators, and priests. Parents
with no God to transmit, teachers with no support in religious creed and
garb, will find the infinite inventive- ness of selfishness, passion,
and greed stronger than their uninspired words. Finally, “there can be
no morality if there is no future state”; 111 there must be another life
to atone for the tribulations of virtue on the earth.</p>
<p>European civilization (Chateaubriand argued) is almost entirely due
to the Catholic Church — to her support of the family and the school, to
her preaching of the Christian virtues, to her checking and cleansing of
popular superstitions and practices, to the healing processes of the
confessional, to her inspiration and encouragement of literature and
art. The Middle Ages wisely abandoned the unguided pursuit of truth for
the creation of beauty, and they produced in the Gothic cathedrals an
architecture superior to that of the Parthenon. Pagan literature has
many excellences for the mind, many pitfalls for morality. The Bible is
greater than Homer, the Prophets are more inspiring than the
philosophers; and what fiction can compare, in tenderness and influence,
with the life and teaching of Christ?</p>
<p>Obviously a book like the Genie could appeal only to those who,
through the excesses of the Revolution or the trials of life, were
emotionally ready</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON 317</p>
<p>o believe. So the philosopher Joubert, Chateaubriand’s friend, said
that he sought in Catholicism a refuge from a revolutionary world too
horrible to bear. 112 Such readers may have smiled at the childish
teleology which taught that “the song of birds is ordained expressly for
our ears…. In spite of our cruelty [to them] they cannot forbear to
charm us, as they are obliged to fulfill the decrees of Providence.” 113
But those readers were so carried</p>
<p>Did he really believe? From 1 80 1 to late in life, we are told, 114
he omitted his “Easter duty” of co nfession and Communion — the Church’s
minimal demand upon her children. Sismondi reported a conversation with
him in 1813:</p>
<p>Chateaubriand observed the universal decadence of religions both in
Europe and in Asia, and compared these symptoms of dissolution with
those of poly- theism in the time of Julian…. He concluded from this
that the nations of Europe would disappear along with their religions. I
was astounded to find him so free a spirit…. Chateaubriand talked of
religion;… he believes it [religion] necessary to sustain the state; he
thinks that he and others are bound to believe. 115</p>
<p>No wonder that, carrying with him through sixty years such a burden
of secret doubt, he never recovered from the youthful pessimism that he
de- scr ibed in Rene. In old age he said, “I ought not to have been
born.” 116</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Rene</li>
</ol>
<p>The Genius of Christianity was a major expression of the Romantic
move- ment in the religious field: it formulated the return of faith and
hope, if not of charity; it exalted medieval poetry and art, and
stimulated the revival of Gothic architecture in France. Within its five
volumes it originally included not only Atala but, till 1805, Rene. This
forty-page paean to pessimism reflected the despondency of emigres , and
Chateaubriand’s youthful infatua - tion with his sisters. It became the
fount and standard of a thousand moans of melodious despair.</p>
<p>Rene is a young French aristocrat who has fled from France and has
joined the Natchez Indian tribe in the hope of forgetting an incestuous
love. His adoptive father, Chactas, having told him the tale of Atala,
persuades him to tell his own story. “Timid and constrained before my
father, I</p>
<p>found ease and contentment only with my sister Amelie.” When he
realized that his love for her was nearing incest, he sought release by
losing himself in the Paris crowd — “vast wilderness of men”; or he sat
for hours in an unfre - quented church, begging God to free him from the
crime of his love or from the incubus of fife. He looked for solitude
amid mountains and fields,</p>
<p>3 i8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>but nowhere could he drive from his thoughts the tenderness and
loveliness of Amelie. Tormented with desire to go to her and declare his
love, he decided, in shame, to kill himself. Amelie divined this
decision when she learned that he was making his will. She hurried to
Paris, found him, em- braced him wildly, and “covered my forehead with
kisses.” Three months of comradeship and restrained happiness followed.
Then, overcome with remorse, she fled to a convent, leaving him a word
of comfort and all her fortune. He sought her and begged permission to
talk with her; she would not see him. When she was about to take the
vows he made his way into the chapel, knelt near her, heard her,
prostrate before the altar, begging, “God of mercy, let me never rise
from this somber bed, and cover with your favors the brother who never p
artook of my criminal passion.” They never saw each other again. He
resumed his thoughts of suicide, but decided to bear the greater pain of
life. “I found” (and this passage became a locus classicus of romantic
grief) “a kind of satisfaction in my suff ering. I discov- ered, with a
secret movement of joy, that sorrow is not, like pleasure, a feel- ing
that wears itself out…. My melancholy became an occupation which filled
all my moments; my heart was entirely and naturally steeped in ennui and
m isery.” 117 Sick of civilization, he decided to lose himself in
America and</p>
<p>It is a story well told, except that the events are improbable and
the senti- ment is overdone. But sentiment had been starved for a
decade; grief had been dangerous and too deep for tears; now, the
Revolution ended and se- curity restored, sentiment was free, and tears
might flow. The melancholy of Rene, echoing Werther’s across a
generation, became a pose for Rene de Chateaubriand, was echoed in
Senancour’s Obermann in 1 804, and was car - ried on in Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage (1813); Chateaubriand reproached</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Chateaubriand and Napoleon</li>
</ol>
<p>The Genius of Christianity, said Napoleon, “is a work of lead and
gold, but the gold predominates…. Everything great and national in
character ought to acknowledge the genius of Chateaubriand.” 119 For his
part he wel - comed the book as admirably concordant with the Concordat.
He arranged a meeting with the author, recognized him as a valuable
property, and appointed him (1803) first secretary to the French Embassy
in Rome. The author recorded the meeting with modesty and pride: “It
mattered</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON</p>
<p>3 r 9</p>
<p>little to him that I had no experience of public affairs, that I was
entirely unfamiliar with practical diplomacy; he believed that some
minds are capable of understanding, and have no need of apprenticeship.”
120 He was soon followed to Rome by his mistress; however, she died in
Rome (November</p>
<p>5), with Chateaubriand at her side, and after bidding him return to
his wife.</p>
<p>He was soon persona grata to the Pope, and ingrata to the ambassador,
Napoleon’s uncle, Cardinal Fesch, who complained that the bri lliant
author was assuming ambassadorial authority. The Cardinal was not the
man to allow this; he asked to be relieved of his aide; Napoleon
recalled the Vis- count by appointing him charge- d’affaires in the
little Swiss republic of Valais. Chateaubriand went to Paris to
consider; but on hearing of the Due d’Enghien’s execution he sent to
Napoleon his resignation from the diplo - matic service.</p>
<p>By daring to leave Bonaparte I had placed myself on his level, and he
was turned against me by all the force of his perfidy, as I was turned
against him by all the force of my loyalty Sometimes I was drawn to him
by the admi-</p>
<p>ration with which he inspired me, and by the idea that I was
witnessing a trans- formation of society and not a mere change of
dynasty; but our respective natures, antipathetic- in so many respects,
always gained the upper hand; and if he would gladly have had me shot, I
should have felt no great compunction about killing him. 121</p>
<p>No immediate harm came to him. He was distracted from politics by the
illness of his wife (whom he loved between liaisons) and the death of
his sister Lucile (1804). Meanwhile he had taken as mistress Delphine de
Custine. In 1806 he sought to replace her with Natalie de Noailles, but
Natalie made her favors conditional on his undertaking a journey to the
holy places in Palestine. 122 Leaving his wife in Venice, he went on to
Corfu, Athens, Smyrna, Constantinople, and Jerusalem; he returned via
Alexandria, Carthage, and Spain, and reached Paris in June, 1807. He had
shown courage and stamina on this arduous tour, and on the way he had
sedulously gathered material and background for two books that
reinforced his literary fame: Les Marytrs de Diocletien (1809), and
Itineraire de Paris d Jerusalem (1811).</p>
<p>While preparing these volumes he carried on his feud with Napoleon
(then negotiating peace at Tilsit) by an article in the Mercure de
France for July 4, 1807. It was ostensibly about Nero and Tacitus, but
it could readily be applied to Napoleon and Chateaubriand.</p>
<p>When, in the silence of abjection, no sign can be heard save that of
the chains of the slave and the voice of the informer; when all tremble
before the tyrant, and it is as dangerous to incur his favor as to merit
his displeasure, the historian appears, entrusted with the vengeance of
the nation. Nero prospers in vain, for Tacitus has already been formed
within the Empire; he grows up unknown beside the ashes of Germanicus,
and already a just Providence has delivered into the hands of an obscure
child the glory of the master of the world. If the historian’s role is a
fine one it often has its dangers; but there are</p>
<p>3 2 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>… Wherever there is a chance for fortune there is no heroism in
trying it; magnanimous actions are those whose foreseeable result is
adversity and death. After all, what do reverses matter if our name,
pronounced by pos- terity, makes a single generous heart beat two
thousand years after we have lived ? 123</p>
<p>On his return from Tilsit Napoleon ordered the new Tacitus to leave
Paris. The Mercure was warned to take no further articles from his pen;
Chateaubriand became a passionate defender of a free press. He retired
to a property that he had bought in the Vallee-aux-Loups at Chatenay,
and devoted himself to preparing Les Martyrs for publication. He deleted
from the manuscript such passages as might be interpreted as derogatory
of Napoleon. In that year (1809) his brother Armand was arrested for
having transmitted dispatches from the emigre Bourbon princes to their
agents in France. Rene wrote to Napoleon asking mercy for Armand;
Napoleon found the letter too proud, and threw it into the fire; Armand
was tried and found guilty, and was shot on March 31. Rene arrived a few
moments after the execution. He never forgot the scene: Armand lying
dead, his face and skull shattered by bullets, “a butcher’s dog licking
up his blood and his brains.” 124 It was Good Friday, 1809.</p>
<p>Chateaubriand buried his grief in his valley solitude and in
preparing his Memoir es dPoutre-tombe. He began these reminiscences in 1
8 1 1 ; he worked on them intermittently as a sedative from travel,
liaisons, and politics; he wrote their last page in 1841, and forbade
their publication till after his death; hence he called them Memoirs
from the Tomb. They are bold in thought, childish in sentiment,
brilliant in style. Here, for example, the parade of Napoleon’s
appointees hurrying to swear their eternal loyalty to Louis XVIII after
Napoleon’s collapse: “Vice en tered leaning on the arm of crime [le vice
appuye sur le bras du crime] — Monsieur de Talleyrand walked in,
supported by Monsieur Fouche.” 125 In those leisurely pages are
descriptions of nature rivaling those in At ala and Rene; and colorful
epi- sodes like the burning of Moscow. 126 Pages of sentiment
abound:</p>
<p>The earth is a charming mother; we come forth from her womb; in
child- hood she holds us to her breasts, which are swollen with milk and
honey; in youth and manhood she lavishes upon us cool waters, her
harvests and her fruits;… when we die she opens her bosom to us again,
and throws a coverlet of grass and flowers over our remains while she
secretly transforms us into her own substance, to be reproduced in some
new and graceful shape. 127</p>
<p>And now and then a flash of philosophy, usually somber: “History is
only a repetition of the same facts applied to diverse men and times.”
128 These Memoir es cP outre- tombe are Chateaubriand’s most enduring
book.</p>
<p>He remained rurally quiet until 1814, when the successes of the
Allied armies brought them to the frontiers of France. Would their
advance, as in 1792, arouse the French people to heroic resistance? On
the fifth anni- versary of Armand’s execution Chate aubriand issued a
powerful pamphlet, De Buonaparte et des Bourbons, which was scattered
through France as Na- poleon retreated, fighting for life. The author
assured the nation that “God</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) LITERATURE VERSUS NAPOLEON</p>
<p>3 21</p>
<p>himself marches openly at the head of the [Allied] armies, and sits
in the Council of the Kings.” 129 He reviewed the offenses of Napoleon—
the execu- tion of Enghien and Cadoudal, the “torture and assassination
of Pichegru,” the imprisonment of the Pope… ; the se “reveal in
Buonaparte” (spelled in the Italian way) “a nature foreign to France”;
130 his crimes must not be charged to the French people. Many rulers had
suppressed freedom of print and speech, but Napoleon had gone further,
and had commanded the press to praise him at whatever cost to truth. The
tributes to him as an ad- ministrator are undeserved; he merely reduced
despotism to a science, turned taxation into confiscation, and
conscription into massacre. In the Russian campaign alone 243,610 men
died after experiencing every manner of suffer- ing, while their leader,
well sheltered and well fed, deserted his army to flee to Paris. 131 How
noble and humane, by comparison, had Louis XVI been! As Napoleon had
asked of the Directory in 1799, “What have you done with the France that
was so brilliant when I left you?,” so now the whole human race</p>
<p>accuses you, calls for vengeance in the name of religion, morality,
freedom. Where have you not spread desolation? In what corner of the
world is there a family so obscure as to have escaped your ravages?
Spain, Italy, Austria, Ger- many, Russia demand of you the sons that you
have slaughtered, the tents, cabins, chateaux, temples that you have put
to flame… The voice of the world declares you the greatest criminal that
has ever appeared on the earth,… you who in the heart of civilization,
in an age of enlightenment, wished to rule by the sword of Attila and
the maxims of Nero. Surrender now your scepter of iron, descend from
that mound of ruins of which you have made a throne! We cast you out as
you cast out the Directory. Go, if you can, as your only punishment, to
be witness of the joy that your fall brings to France, and contempla te,
as you shed tears of rage, the spectacle of the people’s happiness. How
now replace him? With the King who comes sanctified by his birth, a
noble by his character — Louis XVIII, “a prince known for his enlighten
- ment, his freedom from prejudice, hi s repudiation of revenge.” He
comes bearing in his hand a pledge of pardon to all his enemies. “How
sweet it will be, after so many agitations and misfortunes, to rest
under the paternal au- thority of our legitimate sovereign!… Frenchmen,
friends, companions in misfortune, let us forget our quarrels, our
hates, our errors, to save the father- land; let us embrace over the
ruins of our dear country, and call to our help the heir of Henry IV and
Louis XIV… Vive le roi !” 132 Is it any wonder that Louis XVIII later
said that those fifty pages had been worth to him 100,000 troops?
133</p>
<p>Let us leave Chateaubriand here for a while. He was by no means
finished; he still had thirty-four years of life in him. He was to play
an active role in Restoration politics, was still to gather mistresses,
ending at last in the arms of a Recamier who was graduating from beauty
to benevolence. He spent more and more of his time on his Memoires; and
now that his enemy was immured in a distant island, itself imprisoned by
the sea, he could write of him — as he did for 456 pages — in a mood
made milder by time and victory. He lived till 1848, having seen three
French Revolutions.</p>
