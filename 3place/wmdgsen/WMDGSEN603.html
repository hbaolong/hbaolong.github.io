<h4 id="chapter-viii-the-new-empire">CHAPTER VIII The New Empire</h4>
<p>1 804 — 07</p>
<p>I. THE CORONATION: DECEMBER 2, 1804</p>
<p>N APOLEON slipped contentedly into imperial ways. Even before the
plebiscite, he had begun (May, 1804) to sign his letters and docu-</p>
<p>ments with only his first name; soon, except in formal documents, he
reduced this to a simple N ; and in time that proud initial appeared on
monuments, buildings, garments, carriages… He began to speak of the
French people no longer as “citizens” but as “my subjects.” 1 He
expected more deference from his courtiers, readier assent from his
ministers; however, he bore in grim silence Talleyrand’s aristocratic
ways, and accepted with some relish Fouche’s irreverent wit. A
ppreciating the help Fouche had given in ferreting out conspirators, he
restored him (July 1 1, 1804) to his former post as minis- ter of
police. When Napoleon thought to subdue Fouche’s independence of thought
and speech by reminding him of his having voted for the death of Louis
XVI, Fouche replied, “Quite true. It was the first service I had the
occasion to perform for Your Majesty.” 2</p>
<p>One thing was still lacking to this majesty: it had not been
recognized and sanctified, as with other crowns, by the highest
representative of the nation’s religious faith. There was something,
after all, in that medieval - ing an Italian family on the throne of
France to govern those barbarians; we should be avenging ourselves on
the Gauls.” 3 The Pope was probably more practical: he would consent in
the hope of bringing a repentant nation back</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>o papal obedience, and regaining several papal territories that had
been taken by the armies of France.</p>
<p>Napoleon made as careful preparations for this mutual triumph as for
a major war. The coronation rituals of the Old Regime were studied,
adapted, and amplified. Processions were planned as by a choreographer,
and each movement was timed. New dresses were designed for the ladies of
the court; the best milliners gathered around Josephine, and Napoleon
bade her wear the jewels of the Treasury as well as her own; despite the
protests of his mother, brothers, and sisters, he was resolved to crown
her as well as him- self. Jacques-Louis David, who was to commemorate
the event in the great- est painting of the age, rehearsed her and her
attendants in every move and pose. Poets were paid to celebrate the
event. The Opera was instructed to prepare ballets that might stir a
papal breast. Arrangements were made to protect the major streets with
troops, and to line the nave of Notre-Dame with the Consular Guard in a
veritable marriage of Caesar and Christ. Princes and dignitaries from
other states were invited, and came. Multitudes arrived from the city,
the suburbs, the provinces, and abroad, and bargained for places of
vantage in the cathedral or on the routes. Shopkeepers hoped to reap
fortunes, and did. Jobs and spectacles kept the people contented as
perhaps never since the panem et cir censes of Imperial Rome.</p>
<p>The affable Pius VII made his way leisurely, November 2-25, through
cities and ceremonies in Italy and France, and was met by Napoleon at
Fontainebleau. From that moment till the coronation the Emperor gave the
Pope every courtesy except deference; the Emperor was not to be awed
into admitting any superior power. The people of Paris — the most
skeptical on earth at that time — welcomed the Pontiff as a spectacle;
an escort of soldiers and priests led him to the Tuileries, where he was
guided to a special apart- ment in the Pavilion de Flore. Josephine
welcomed him, and seized the occa- sion to tell him that she had not
been united with Napoleon in a religious marriage; Pius promised to
remedy that defect before the coronation. On the night of November 29-30
he remarried them, and Josephine felt that a blessed obstacle had been
raised against a divorce. 4</p>
<p>Early on a cold December 2 a dozen processions left from different
points to converge Qn Notre-Dame: deputations from the cities of France,
from the Army and Navy, the legislative assemblies, the judiciary, and
the adminis- trative corps, the Legion of Honor, the Institute, the
chambers of commerce… They found the cathedral nearly filled with
invited civilians, but sol- diers made way for them to their appointed
places. At 9 a.m., from the Pavilion de Flore, the papal procession set
forth: Pius VII and his servitors, the cardinals and the grand officers
of the Curia, in gaily decorated coaches drawn by horses chosen for
their spirit and beauty, all led by a bishop on a mule and bearing aloft
the papal crucifix. At the cathedral they descended and walked in formal
array up the steps, into the nave, and through lanes of stiff soldiers
to their assigned stations — the Pope to his throne at the altar’s left.
Meanwhile, from another point of the Tuileries, the imperial
cavalcade</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>proceeded: first, Marshal Murat, governor of Paris, and his staff;
then some specially distinguished regiments of the Army; then, in
six-horse carriages, the leading officers of the government; then a
carriage for the Bonaparte brothers and sisters; then a royal coach
marked with a blazoned N, drawn by eight horses, and bearing the Emperor
in purple velvet embroidered with gems and gold, and the Empress, at the
peak of her precarious splendor, robed in silk and sparkling with
jewelry, “her face so well made up that,” though forty- one, “she looked
like four-and- twenty.” 5 Then eight more carriages, bearing the ladies
and officers of the court. It took an hour for all these carriages to
reach the cathedral. There Napoleon and Josephine changed to coronation
robes, and took their places at the right of the altar; he on a throne,
she on a smaller throne five steps below him.</p>
<p>The Pope ascended the altar; Napoleon, then Josephine, mounted to
kneel before him; each of the two was anointed and blessed. Emperor and
Empress stepped down to where General Kellermann stood with a crown on a
tray. Napoleon took the crown and placed it on his head. Then, as
Josephine knelt in piety and modesty before him, he — “with a kind of
noticeable ten - derness” 6 — placed a crown of diamonds upon her
jeweled hair. All this was no surprise to the Pope, for it had been so
arranged in advance.* The patient Pontiff then kissed Napoleon on the
cheek, and pronounced the official formula, “Vivat Imperator in
aeternum.” The Pope sang Mass. His assistants brought a book of the
Gospels to him, and Napoleon, placing his hand on the book, recited the
oath that still affirmed him to be the Son of the Revo- lution:</p>
<p>I swear to maintain the territory of the Republic in its integrity;
to respect and enforce the laws of the Concordat and the Freedom of
Worship; to re- spect and enforce Equality before the Law, political and
civil liberty, and the irreversibility of the sales of national
property; to lay on no duty, to impose no tax, except according to law;
to maintain the institution of the Legion of Honor; and to govern only
in accordance with the interests, the happiness, and the glory of the
French people. 8</p>
<p>By three o’clock the ceremony was complete. Through an acclaiming
crowd, under falling snow, the various groups proceeded back to their
points of origin. The genial Pontiff, fascinated by the glamour of Paris
and the hope of fruitful negotiations, remained in or near the capital
for four months, frequently appearing on a balcony to bless a kneeling
crowd. He found Napoleon politely immovable, and bore patiently the
secular entertain- ments offered him by his host. On April 15, 1805, he
left for Rome. Napo- leon resumed his imperial projects and ways,
confident that now, being as holy as any ruler, he could face
unbendingly the powers that would soon unite to destroy him.</p>

<li>THE THIRD COALITION: 1805</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of 1 804 all the European governments except England, Swe-
den, and Russia had recognized Napoleon as “emperor of the French,” and
some kings had addressed him as “brother.” 9 On January 2, 1805, he
again proposed peace to George III, and now addressed him as</p>
<p>Sir and Brother:</p>
<p>Having been called by Providence, and by the voice of the Senate, the
peo- ple, and the army, to the throne of France, my first feeling is a
desire for peace.</p>
<p>France and England are wasting their prosperity. They may contend for
centuries, but are their Governments rightfully fulfilling their most
sacred duty, and does not their conscience reproach them with so much
blood shed in vain, for no definite end? I am not ashamed to take the
initiative. I have, I think, sufficiently proved… that I do not fear the
chances of war…. Peace is my heartfelt wish, but war has never been
adverse to my renown. I implore Your Majesty not to deprive yourself of
the happiness of bestowing peace on the world…. Never was there a better
occasion… for imposing silence on passion, and for listening to the
voice of humanity and reason. If this oppor- tunity be lost, what term
can be assigned to a war which all my endeavors might fail to
terminate?…</p>
<p>What do you hope to attain by war? The coalition of some Continental
Powers?… To snatch her colonies from France? Colonies are objects of but
secondary importance to France; and does not Your Majesty already
possess more than you can keep?…</p>
<p>The world is large enough for our two nations to live in it, and the
power of reason is sufficient to enable us to overcome all difficulties
if on both sides there is the will to do so. In any case I have
fulfilled a duty which I hold to be righteous, and which is dear to my
heart. I trust Your Majesty will believe in the sincerity of the
sentiments I have expressed, and in my earnest desire to give you proof
of them.</p>
<p>Napoleon 10</p>
<p>We do not know what private assurances of pacifist intent may have
ac- companied this proposal; in any case it did not swerve England from
basing her security upon a balance of Continental Powers, and preserving
this by encouraging the weak against the strong. George III, not yet a
“brother,” did not answer Napoleon, but on January 14, 1805, his Foreign
Secretary, Lord Mulgrave, sent T alleyrand a letter that frankly stated
England’s terms for peace:</p>
<p>His Majesty has no dearer wish than to embrace the first opportunity
of once more procuring for his subjects the advantages of a peace which
shall be founded on bases not incompatible with the permanent security
and the essen- tial interests of his States. His Majesty is convinced
that this end can only be attained by an arrangement which will provide
alike for the future security and tranquillity of Europe, and prevent a
renewal of the dangers and mis- fortunes which have beset the
Continent.</p>
<p>His Majesty, therefore, feels it to be impossible to reply more
decisively to</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>he question which has been put to him, until he has had time to
communicate with those Continental Powers with whom he is allied, and
particularly with the Emperor of Russia, who has given the strongest
proofs of his wisdom and good feeling, and of the deep interest which he
takes in the security and inde- pendence of Europe. 11</p>
<p>William Pitt the Younger was currently prime minister of England
(May, 1804 — January, 1806). He represented, as the new financial
bastion of Brit- ain, the commercial interests that were almost the only
British gainers from the war. They had borne substantial losses from
French control of the mouths and course of the Rhine; but they were
profiting from British control of the seas. This not only stifled most
French maritime competition, it enabled Britain to seize French and
Dutch colonies at will, and French vessels wherever found. On October 5,
1804, English ships seized several Spanish galleons bound for Spain with
silver that would have enabled her to pay much of her debt to France. In
December, 1804, England declared war upon Spain, and Spain placed her
fleet at the disposal of France. With this exception, Britain, with
superior diplomats and judicious subsidies, slowly won to her side
Continental Powers richer in men than in gold. Alexander I could not
make up his mind whether he was a liberal reformer and benevolent despot
or a martial conqueror called by destiny to dominate Europe. However, he
was clear on several points: he wanted to round out his western
boundaries by absorbing Wallachia and Moldavia, which be- longed to
Turkey; consequently he aspired, like the absorbing Catherine, to
overcome Turkey, bestride the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, and, in due
time, control the Mediterranean; already he held the Ionian Isles. But
Napo- leon had once captured those islands, and now longed for them; he
still hungered for Egypt, and thirsted for the Mediterranean; he had
talked of swallowing Turkey and half of the Orient. Here was a rival
gourmand; one or the other must yield. For these and other reasons
Alexander had no wish to see England make peace with France. In January,
1805, he signed an alli- ance with Sweden, which was already allied with
England. On July 1 1 he completed with England a treaty which stipulated
that Britain would pay Russia an annual subsidy of £ 1,250,000 for every
100,000 men contributed to the campaigns against France. 12</p>
<p>Frederick William III of Prussia parleyed with Napoleon for a year
in</p>
<p>he hope of adding to his realm the province of Hanover, which the</p>
<p>French had taken in 1803. Napoleon offered it on condition of an
alliance which would pledge Prussia to support France in maintaining the
new status; Frederick did not relish the thought of angry British
warships along his coast. On May 24, 1804, he signed an alliance with
Russia for united action against any French advance east of the
Weser.</p>
<p>Austria too hesitated. If she joined the new coalition she would bear
the first brunt of French attack. But Austria, even more closely than
England, had felt the successive pushes of Napoleon’s expanding power:
the presi - dency of the Italian Republic, January, 1802; the French
annexation of Piedmont, September, 1802; the Swiss submission to a
French protectorate,</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>February, 1803; the assumption of the imperial title, May, 1804. And
the pushes continued: on May 26, 1805, Napoleon received at Milan the
Iron Crown of Lombardy; and on June 6 he accepted the request of the
Doge of Genoa that the Ligurian Republic be incorporated into France.
When, asked the Austrians, would this new Charlemagne stop? Could he not
— unless most of Europe should unite to stop him — easily absorb first
the Papal States and then the kingdom of Naples? What then would keep
him from appropriat- ing Venice and all of that luscious Venezia which
was contributing so indis- pensably to Austrian revenues? Such was the
mood of Austria when Britain offered her fresh subsidies, and Russia
promised her 100,000 hardy troops in case France should attack. On June
17, 1805, Austria allied herself with England, Russia, Sweden, and
Prussia, and the Third Coalition was com- plete.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>AUSTERUTZ: DECEMBER 2, 1805</li>
</ol>
<p>Against this quintuple alliance France had the hesitant support of
Hesse, Nassau, Baden, Bavaria, and Wiirttemberg, and the cooperation of
the Dutch and Spanish fleets. From all quarters of his realm Napoleon
drew money and conscripts, and organized three armies: (1) the Army of
the Rhine, under Davout, Murat, Soult, and Ney, to challenge the main
Austrian force under General Mack; (2) the Army of Italy, under Massena,
to meet the westward thrust of an Austrian army under the Archduke Karl
Ludwig; and (3) the Grande Armee of Napoleon, presently gathered about
Bou- logne, but capable of being suddenly turned upon Austria. His hope
was that a quick capture of Vienna would compel Austria to sign a
separate peace, immobilizing her Continental allies, and leaving England
unaided and besieged.</p>
<p>The young Emperor had come to hate England as the bane of his life
and the chief obstacle to his dreams; he called her “perfide Albion and
de - nounced British gold as the main source of France’s woes. Night and
day, amid a hundred other projects, he planned the building of a navy
that would end Britannia’s lordship of the seas. He poured funds and
workers into naval arsenals like Toulon and Brest, and he tested a dozen
captains to find an admiral who could lead the growing French Navy to
victory. He thought he had found such a man in Louis de La
Touche-Treville, and strove to in- spire him with the vision of a
Britain invaded and overcome. “If we can be masters of the Channel for
six hours we shall be masters of the world.” 13 But La Touche-Treville
died in 1804, and Napoleon made the mistake of giving command of the
French Navy to Pierre de Villeneuve.</p>
<p>Villeneuve had bungled his share in the Egyptian fiasco, and had
given signs of both insubordination and timidity. He had no faith in the
possibility of capturing control of the Channel for six hours, and he
lingered in Paris until Napoleon ordered him to his post at Toulon. His
instructions were subtle and complex: to lead his fleet out to sea, let
Nelson pursue him with</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>he main British flotilla, draw him on across the Atlantic to the West
Indies, elude him among those islands, and return as swiftly as possible
to the Eng- lish Channel, where French, Dutch, and Spanish squadrons
would join him in engaging the British vessels there long enough to let
the French army, in its thousand boats, cross to England before Nelson
could come back from the Caribbean. Villeneuve accomplished the first
part of his task well: he lured Nelson to America, escaped him, and
hurried back to Europe. But on reaching Spain he judged his ships and
men to be in no condition to over- come the British guardians of the
Channel; instead he sought the protection of a friendly harbor at Cadiz.
Napoleon, frustrated in his plan, sent orders to Villeneuve to seek out
Nelson’s fleet and risk everything in a desperate</p>
<p>Then, in a flurry of decision, the Emperor turned away from the
Channel, and wheeled a hundred thousand men around to march south and
east to the Rhine and beyond. All France followed in anxious hope the
course of this Grande Armee, now so named by Napoleon, and every town on
its itinerary bade it Godspeed on its enterprise. In nearly every church
the clergy called upon the youth of the nation to obey the call to the
colors; they proved from Scripture that Napoleon was now under the
direct guidance and protection of God; 14 so soon had the Concordat come
to fruit. Napoleon cooperated by arranging that twenty thousand
carriages should be provided along the route to hurry and relieve the
soldiers on their passage through France. 15 He himself rode to
Strasbourg with Josephine, who was now all anxiety and devotion; her
fortunes too hung on every throw of the dice. He promised that within a
few weeks he would be master of Vienna. 16 At Stras- bourg he left her
in the care of Remusat, and hurried on to the front.</p>
<p>His strategy, as usual, was to divide and conquer: to keep the
Austrian armies from uniting; to destroy or immobilize the armed forces
of Austria before the Russian horde whose aid they were expecting could
arrive; and then to overwhelm the Russians in a victory that would
compel his Conti- nental enemies to at least a temporary peace. Despite
gloomy days and dark nights of rain, mud, and snow, the Army of the
Rhine carried out its share of the campaign with a thoroughness and
dispatch that may serve as an illus- tration of how much Napoleon owed
to his marshals. After a week of ma- neuvers General Mack’s 50,000 men
found themselves, at Ulm, hemmed in on three sides by the artillery,
cavalry, and infantry of Davout, Soult, Murat, and Ney, and denied
retreat by the width of the Danube behind them. Starved for food, and
short of ammunition, the besieged Austrians threat- ened mutiny unless
they were allowed to surrender. Mack did so at last (October 17, 1805);
30,000 of his troops were taken prisoner and sent to France. It was one
of the least costly and most thorough and effective vic- tories in the
history of war. Emperor Francis II, and some Austrian survivors from
Ulm, fled north to join the oncoming Russians, while Napoleon en- tered
Vienna (November 1 2 ) without resistance and without display.</p>
<p>His triumph was soon soured by news that Villeneuve, pursuant to in-
structions, had gone out to meet Nelson in what proved for both of
them</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>a duel to the death. Nelson won at Trafalgar (October 21, 1805), but
was mortally wounded; Villeneuve lost, and killed himself. Napoleon
somberly put aside all hope of contesting British control of the seas;
no course to vic- tory seemed open but to win so many battles on land
that the Continental Powers would be forced to follow France in closing
their markets to British goods until the merchants of England should
compel their government to sue for peace.</p>
<p>Leaving General Mortier and fifteen thousand men to hold Vienna, he
set out on November 17 to join his troops and prepare them to meet two
Russian armies marching south, one under the resolute Kutuzov, the other
under Czar Alexander himself. The Russian Bear met the French Eagle at
Austerlitz, a village in Moravia, on December 2, 1805. Before the battle
Napoleon issued a proclamation to his legions:</p>
<p>Soldiers:</p>
<p>The Russian army appears before you to avenge the Austrian army of
Ulm…. The positions which we occupy are formidable; while they are
marching to turn my right, they will present their flank to me….</p>
<p>I shall myself direct your battalions. I shall keep out of the fire
if, with your usual bra very, you throw disorder and confusion into the
enemy’s ranks. But if the victory should be for a moment uncertain, you
will see your emperor the foremost to expose himself to danger. For
victory must not hang doubtful on this day most particularly, when the
honor of the French infantry, which so deeply concerns the honor of the
whole nation, is at stake…. It behooves us to conquer these hirelings of
England, who are animated with such bitter hatred of our nation….</p>
<p>This victory will put an end to the campaign, and we shall then be
able to turn to our winter quarters, where we shall be joined by the new
armies which are forming in France; and then the peace which I shall
make will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself. 17</p>
<p>His first tactic was to capture a hill that would allow his artillery
to rake the Russian infantry moving to flank his right. That hill was
held by some of Kutuzov’s bravest men; they gave way, re -formed, fought
again, and were finally overcome by Napol eon’s reserves. Soon the
French artillery was decimating the Russians as they marched on the
plain below; their center broke in terror and flight, dividing their
army into disorganized halves faced at the one end by the infantry of
Davout and Soult, at the other by the battalions of Lannes, Murat, and
Bernadotte; and into the shattered center Napoleon sent his reserves to
complete the rout. The 87,000 Russians and Austrians surrendered 20,000
prisoners and nearly all their artillery, and left 15,000 dead.
Alexander and Francis fled with the remnants into Hungary, while their
frightened ally, Frederick William III, humbly sued for peace.</p>
<p>In that holocaust the 73,000 French and their allies lost 8,000 dead
or wounded. The exhausted survivors, long hardened to the sight of
death, cheered their leader with wild enthusiasm. In a bulletin of
December 3 he answered them with a promise that he would soon keep:
“When all that is necessary for securing the happiness and prosperity of
our country has been accomplished, I will lead you back to France. There
you will be the object</p>

<p>205</p>
<p>of my most tender solicitude. My people will welcome you with joy,
and you will only have to say ‘I was at the battle of Austerlitz’ for
people to exclaim, ‘Behold a hero.’ ” 18</p>

<li>the mapmaker: 1806-07</li>
</ol>
<p>When William Pitt received the news of Austerlitz, he was nearing
death. Seeing a map of Europe on a wall, he asked that it be removed.
“Roll up that map,” he said; “it will not be wanted these ten years.” 19
Napoleon agreed, and remade the map.</p>
<p>He began by remaking Prussia and Austria. Talleyrand, whom he sum-
moned to Vienna to phrase the imperial will in diplomatic language,
advised him to give Austria moderate terms on condition of signing with
France an alliance that might end the connection of English subsidies
with Austrian policies, and might give France some support, even if only
geographical, in conflict with Prussia and Russia. Napoleon, suspecting
the fragility of alli- ances, thought rather to weaken Austria beyond
possibility of challenging France again, and to win Prussia from Russia
by an easy peace. Meanwhile he allowed Alexander to lead his surviving
Russians back to Russia unpur- sued.</p>
<p>By a treaty signed in Maria Theresa’s cabinet in the Austrian royal
palace of Schonbrunn (December 5, 1805), Napoleon required Prussia to
disband its Army, cede the margravate of Ansbach to Bavaria, and the
principality of Neuchatel to France, and to accept a binding alliance
with its conqueror. Frederick William III expected to get in return the
province of Hanover, which Napoleon was glad to promise him as a
deterrent to any pro-English sentiment in Prussia.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Pressburg with Austria (completed in Napoleon’s
absence, December 26, 1805) was merciless. She had begun hostilities by
invading Bavaria; she was now required to give up to Bavaria, Baden, and
Wiirttem- berg all her lands in the Tirol, Vorarlberg, and south
Germany. So en- larged, Bavaria and Wiirttemberg became kingdoms, and
Baden became a grand duchy allied with France. To recompense France for
her outlay of men, money, and materiel in the war, Austria transferred
to a French pro- tectorate all her possessions in Italy, including
Venice and its hinterlands; and she agreed to pay France an indemnity of
forty million francs — part of which, Napoleon was happy to learn, had
recently arrived from England. 20 In addition he ordered his art
connoisseurs to send to Paris some choice pic- tures and statues from
Austrian palaces and galleries. All this tribute of land and money and
art the victor, in his Roman way, considered to be rightful spoils of
war. Finally he ordered that a triumphal column be erected in the Place
Vendome in Paris, and be coated with metal taken from enemy cannon
captured at Austerlitz.</p>
<p>Talleyrand signed these treaties, but, disappointed by the rejection
of his advice, he began to use his influence — not always this side of
treason —</p>
<p>20 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>against the further extension of Napoleon’s power. He later excused
himself as having served France by his disservices to his employer, but
he made both of them pay.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1805, Napoleon left Vienna to join Josephine in Mu-
nich. There they assisted at the marriage of Eugene (who had been made
viceroy of Italy) to t he Princess Augusta, eldest daughter of Bavaria’s
King. Before the wedding Napoleon formally adopted Eugene as his son,
and promised him the crown of Italy as his inheritance. It was a
marriage of political convenience, to cement the alliance of Bavaria
with France; but Augusta learned to love her husband, and helped to save
him after his adop- tive father’s fall.</p>
<p>Emperor and Empress went on to Paris, where he was met with such
offi- cial celebrations and public acclaim that Mme. de Remusat wondered
“if it be possible that a human head should not be turned by such excess
of praise.” 21 Facts helped to sober him. He found that during his
absence mis - management had brought the Treasury near to bankruptcy;
the Austrian in- demnity came to its rescue. He still had to contend
with attempts upon his life, for on February 20, 1806, he received word
from Charles James Fox, then prime minister of England, that he should
be on his guard, since a would-be assassin had offered to kill Napoleon
for a reasonable sum. 22 Fox had had the man kept under detention, but
there were probably other such patriots for a price. As England was then
at war with France, the Prime Minister’s act lived up to both the
Christian and the chivalric code. Amid homicide individual and
collective, France, on January 1, 1806, returned to the Christian
Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>On May 2, after four months of administrative recuperation, the
Emperor read to the Corps Legislat if his “Report on the Condition of
the Empire in</p>
<p>1806.” It recounted briefly the victories of the Army, and the
acquisition of allies and terrain; it described the flourishing
condition of French agriculture and industry; it announced the
Industrial Exhibition — something new in French history — that was to
open at the Louvre in the fall; it noted the build- ing or repair of
harbors, canals, bridges, and 33,500 miles of roads — several of these
across the Alps; it told of great structures in progress — the Temple de
la Victoire (now La Madeleine), the Bourse or Stock Exchange, which
lifted money into art, and the Arc de Triomphe de l’Ltoile that was
begin - ning to crown the Champs-Elysees; and it ended with the
assurance which France was beginning to s eek: “It is not conquests that
the Emperor has in mind; he has exhausted the sphere of military glory….
To perfect the ad- ministration, and make it a source of lasting
happiness and ever-increasing prosperity for his people,… such is the
glor y at which he aims.” 23</p>
<p>The mapmaking continued. On July 12, 1806, the incredible Emperor
accepted, as a gift, another empire, composed of the kingdoms of Ba-
varia, Saxony, Wurttemberg, and Westphalia, the grand duchies of Baden,
Berg, Frankfurt, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Wurzburg, the duchies of Anhalt,
Arenberg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Nassau, Oldenburg, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe-
Gotha, Saxe- Weimar, and half a dozen petty principalities. The
initiative in</p>

<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>his remarkable marriage of friend and foe had been taken (according
to Meneval) 24 by the “Prince Primate” Karl Theodor von Dalberg,
formerly archbishop of Mainz. Under his lead the heads of the various
states asked Napoleon to take them under his protection, pledged him
contingents (total- ing 63,000 men) for his armies, announced their
separation from the Holy Roman Empire (which Charlemagne had established
in a.d. 800), and formed the Confederation of the Rhine. Probably this
new orientation of Teutonic regions was eased by the spread, among them,
of the French lan- guage and literature. The intellectual community was
almost international. Prussia naturally protested against the immense
strengthening of France, but Austria, helpless in defeat, accepted the
change. Since the withdrawal of sixteen princes and their states reduced
the Holy Roman Empire to an in- considerable fraction of its original
extent, Francis II (August 6, 1806) re- nounced his title and
prerogatives as head of the once spacious structure that Voltaire had
called “not holy, not Roman, and not an empire,” and hence - forth he
contented himself with the title of Francis I, Emperor of Austria.</p>
<p>Now the French Empire, and soon the Code Napoleon, extended in effect
from the Atlantic to the Elbe. It included France, Belgium, Holland, the
border states west of the Rhine, Geneva, and nearly all of Italy north
of the Papal States. The man who had envied Charlemagne had apparently
re- peated Charlemagne’s achievement of “giving laws to the West”— i.e.,
West- ern Europe. But from the Atlantic to the Elbe thoughtful souls
wondered: How long can this brotherhood of Gaul and Teuton last?</p>
<p>V. JENA, EYLAU, FRIEDLAND: 1806-07</p>
<p>On August 15, 1806, France celebrated St. Napoleon’s Day and Napo -
leon’s thirty -seventh birthday. The country, wrote Mme. de Remusat
(usually critical), “was in a state of profound tranquillity. Day by day
the Emperor met with less opposition. A firm, equable, and strict
administration — which was just inasmuch as it was equal for all —
regulated both the exer- cises of authority and the mode of supporting
it. Conscription was rigor- ously enforced, but as yet the murmurs of
the people were faint; the French had not then exhausted the sentiment
of glory.” 25 Best of all, Prime Minister Fox for England, and Count
Peter Oubril for Russia, had opened negoti- ations for peace.</p>
<p>Prussia, however, was reeling toward war. Her shotgun union with
France had proved costly: England and Sweden had declared war upon her;
the British Navy had blockaded her ports and seized her ships on the
seas; her economy was suffering; her people wondered why their King had
made so damaging an alliance. Her elder statesmen, contemplating the
splendor of an army still stiff with proud memories of Frederick the
Great, and count- ing the manpower that Czar Alexander was preparing for
another round with France, told the hesitant Frederick William III that
a lasting alliance with Russia was Prussia’s only alternative to being
swallowed in Napoleon’s</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>gaping appetite. Queen Louise, beautiful and passionate, doted upon
the handsome and courtly Alexander, called Napoleon a “monster,” and
scorned her husband’s fear of that “scum from hell”; 26 the regiment
that bore her name wildly cheered her as, shapely in her colonel’s
uniform, she rode be - fore them on the parade ground. Prince Loui s
Ferdinand, the King’s cousin, itched for war as a path of glory to a
throne.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1806, Frederick William sent Alexander an assurance that
Prussia’s treaty with France would never interfere with the treaty it
had made with Russia in 1800. In July he was shocked to learn that
Napoleon had received under his protectorate a Confederation of the
Rhine which in- cluded several regions formerly held by Prussia and
supposedly still within her sphere of influence. Furthermore the
Prussian ambassador to France notified his master that Bonaparte was
secretly proposing the return of Han- over to England as part of the
price of peace; Hanover had been promised to Prussia; the King felt
betrayed. On August 9 he ordered the mobilization of the Prussian Army.
On August 26 Napoleon aroused Prussia still further by ordering — or
allowing — the execution of Palm, a Nuremberg bookseller, for issuing a
brochure urging resistance to France. On September 6, in a letter to the
Czar, Frederick William pledged himself to join in an attack upon “the
disturber of the universe.” 27 On September 13 the gallant Fox died;
this, Napoleon would later say, “was one of the fatalities of my
career.</p>
<p>He must have lost his taste for battle, for when he had to part from
Jose- phine at Mainz he suffered a nervous collapse. Possibly he had
come to realize that no matter how often he risked his throne and life
in war, no victory would ever win him an acceptable peace. Mme. de
Remusat de- scribed the scene as reported to her by her husband:</p>
<p>The Emperor sent my husband to summon the Empress; he returned with
her in a few moments. She was weeping. Agitated by her tears, the
Emperor held her for a long time in his arms, and seemed almost unable
to bid her fare- well. He was strongly moved, and M. de Talleyrand was
also much affected. The Emperor, still holding his wife to his heart,
approached M. de Talleyrand with outstretched hand; then, throwing his
arms around both at once, he said to M. de Remusat, “It is very hard to
leave the two persons one loves best.” As he uttered these words he was
overcome by a sort of nervous emotion, which increased to such a degree
that he wept uncontrollably; and almost im- mediately an attack of
convulsions ensued, which brought on vomiting. He was</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>placed in a chair, and drank some orange-flower water, but continued
to weep for fully a quarter of an hour. At length he mastered himself,
and rising sud- denl y, shook M. de Talleyrand’s hand, gave a last
embrace to his wife, and said to M. de Remusat: “Are the carriages
ready? Call the suite, and let us go.” 29</p>
<p>He had to hurry, for his strategy depended upon bringing his best
forces against the Prussians before the Russians could reach the front.
The Prus- sians were not yet united: in the fore were 50,000 men under
Prince Fried- rich Ludwig of Hohenlohe; farther back were 60,000 men
under Frederick William ana that same gentlemanly Duke of Brunswick who,
fifteen years before, had vowed to destroy Paris; add some 30,000
Hanoverians, who had come without ecstasy to the aid of their new King;
in all, 140,000 men. Na- poleon had 130,000 soldiers, hastily assembled
but skilled in maneuvers, strangers to defeat, and confidently led by
Lannes, Davout, Augereau, Soult, Murat, and Ney. Lannes and Augereau
caught one Prussian division at Saal- feld, a plain between the Saale
and the Ilm, tributaries of the Elbe; the Prus- sians, unused to the
quick maneuvers of the French, were routed, and there Prince Louis
Ferdinand was killed (October 10, 1806).</p>
<p>The French rushed on, 56,000 of them, and came upon Hohenlohe’s army
near Jena, home of the famous university where Schiller had recently
taught, and where Hegel, a year later, was to puzzle the world with a
new philoso- phy. Napoleon deployed his forces in a complex web that
enabled the di- visions of Lannes and Soult to charge the enemy’s center
and left flank while Augereau’s division attacked the right, and Murat’s
cavalry rode furi - ously into the disordered Prussians, who abandoned
all formation and fled from the field. In their flight they ran into the
broken battalions of the Duke of Brunswick, which had been routed at
Auerstedt by a French army bril- liantly led by Davout; there the Duke
of Brunswick was mortally wounded. On that day, October 14, 1806, the
Prussians lost 27,000 dead or wounded, 18,000 prisoners, and nearly all
their artillery. Napoleon, that evening, sent a hurried report to
Josephine: “We have met the Prussian army and it no longer exists. I am
well, and press you to my heart.” 30 In the following days Ney, Soult,
and Murat, pursuing the fugitives, captured 20,000 more men. Davout and
Augereau drove straight on to Berlin; it quickly surrendered; and on
October 27 Napoleon entered the Prussian capital.</p>
<p>One of his first acts was to levy from Prussia and her allies a
contribution of 160 million francs to pay the expenses of the French
army. 31 In addition Berlin was required to supply the occupying forces
with food, clothing, and medicines. Art scouts were ordered to dispatch
to Paris the best pictures and statues in Berlin and Potsdam; Napoleon
himself, in a tour of Potsdam, appropriated the sword of Frederick the
Great.</p>
<p>From Berlin, November 21, 1806, he issued an historic decree: hence-
forth no vessel coming from Great Britain or her colonies should be
allowed to enter any port in the French Empire, which now included the
Hanseatic towns; no goods from Great Britain or her possessions were to
be allowed entry into any territory governed by, or allied with, France;
no Briton was</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>o enter those lands. Finding all his military victories of no avail
in persuad- ing England to peace, and knowing that she would apply her
blockade to any regions controlled by France, as she had (in May, 1806)
extended it to all the coast from Brest to the Elbe, 32 Napoleon sought
to turn that weapon around: Britain was to be shut out from the
Continent, as the British fleet had shut out France and her allies from
all maritime trade. Perhaps in this way, he hoped, the merchants and
manufacturers of Britain might be moved to peace.</p>
<p>There were many weak points in the plan. Continental manufacturers,
freed from British competition, would raise the prices of their
products, and consumers would mourn the absence of British products to
which they had become accustomed. There would be much smuggling and
bribery. (Al- ready Bourrienne, whom Napoleon had made minister at
Hamburg, was amassing a fortune by selling exemptions from the blockade;
Napoleon had to dismiss him again.) Russia was still allied with
England, and British goods could cross the Russian frontiers into
Prussia and Austria. British goods were daily pouring into the port of
Danzig, which was still held by Prussian troops.</p>
<p>Though the Prussian Army had been shattered, and Napoleon was dic-
tator in Berlin, his military situation was more immediately worrisome
than his economic affairs. Most of Poland was held by Russia and
Prussia, and Polish patriots were sending appeals to Napoleon to come
and free their once proud country from these humiliating yokes; however,
a well-equipped army of eighty thousand Russians, stationed west of the
Vistula under Count Levin Bennigsen, was preparing to challenge any
French intrusion into Pol- ish affairs. The French army, slowly
recovering from Jena, was not eager to offer such a challenge; unused to
the damp Baltic cold, it looked with tremors at the approaching winter,
and longed for home. Meanwhile a depu- tation came from Paris to Berlin,
ostensibly to congratulate Napoleon on his brilliant victories, but
really to beg him to make peace and return to a France that had begun to
see in every Napoleonic victory the necessity for many more, each
risking all. He told the delegates that he could not stop now; that the
Russian challenge had to be met, and that the blockade of England would
fail unless Russia were coaxed or forced to join in the plan. He bade
his army advance into Prussian Poland; it met with no immediate
resistance, and on December 19, 1806, Napoleon entered Warsaw unhin-
dered and acclaimed.</p>
<p>All classes, from nobles still longing for the liberum veto to the
peasants still suffering the disabilities of serfdom, united in seeing
him as the miracle- worker who would annul the three partitions of their
country by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and would make Poland again a
sovereign state. He re- turned plaudits with lauds, praised their
nation, their heroes, and their women (who spoke French as readily as
their own seductively sibilant tongue), and took one of these, Countess
Marie Laczynska Walewska, to his bed and heart. His appeals to her,
before and after, were as humble and passionate as his early letters to
his Josephine. Walewska refused him (we</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>21 1</p>
<p>are told) until a group of Polish nobles, “in a document signed with
all the first names in Poland,” called upon her to sacrifice herself in
the hope that Napoleon would thereby be moved to restore the integrity
and inde- pendence of their thrice-partitioned country. It reminded her
that Esther had given herself to Ahasuerus not out of love for him, but
to save her peo- ple. “If but we could say the same, to your glory and
our good fortune!” 38 When Josephine begged to be allowed to come up
from Mainz, Napoleon used the bad roads of Poland as reason for bidding
his wife, “Go back to Paris;… be bright and gay; perhaps I shall be
there soon.” 34</p>
<p>Hibernating with Walewska, he hoped that the Russians would await the
spring before troubling him. But when he sent a force under Marshal
Fran- §ois-Joseph Lefebvre to capture Danzig, Bennigsen led nearly all
his 80,000 men across the Vistula in a massive attack upon Lefebvre’s
columns as they neared Thorn. Couriers rushed back to notify Napoleon;
he hurried north, and with 65,000 men, on February 8, 1807, he fought at
Eylau (south of Konigsberg) one of the costliest battles in his wars.
The Russian artillery proved superior to the French; Augereau, old,
wounded, and dazed, asked to be relieved of his command, alleging that
he could no longer think clearly; Murat’s cavalry broke the enemy’s
lines, but these re -formed, and stood their ground till evening. Then
Bennigsen ordered a retreat, leaving 30,000 men killed or disabled on
the field; however, he reported to the Czar that he had won a glorious
victory. The Czar celebrated it with a Te Deum Mass at St. Petersburg.
35</p>
<p>The French had won, but they had lost 10,000 wounded or dead, and the
survivors wondered how they could resist another assault from those
tough and innumerable Slavs. Napoleon too now had unwonted moods of
gloom; that diseased stomach which was to kill him was already humbling
him with pain. He never forgot the devoted care that Marie Walewska gave
him through that trying winter in the army camp at Finkenstein.
Nevertheless he labored daily, ordering food, clothing, and medicine for
his troops, supervis- ing military practice, summoning conscripts from
his weary people and his reluctant allies, and issuing decrees for the
government of France. In the meantime Czar Alexander I and King
Frederick William III met at Barten- stein on April 26, 1807, and signed
an agreement for dividing non-French Europe between them after the next
battle, in which they expected the French army to be destroyed.</p>
<p>When that mutilated army had been reinforced, and cheered by the
sprouting spring, Napoleon sent another detachment to take Danzig; it
was done. Bennigsen, who had also rebuilt his battalions, received
orders from Alexander to march to Konigsberg, where he would be
fortified by a Prus- sian garrison 24,000 strong. Bennigsen proceeded,
but on the way he allowed his 46,000 men to rest at Friedland. There, at
three o’clock in th e morning of June 14, 1807 (anniversary of Marengo),
they were awakened by an artillery barrage from 12,000 Frenchmen led by
the reckless but undefeated Lannes. The Russians soon returned his fire,
and his venture might have ended in disaster had not reinforcements
come. Napoleon rushed up with</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>his entire force, and hemmed in the Russians on every side except the
River Alle, which denied them retreat. By 5 p.m. the French prevailed;
the Rus- sians took to boats or the water in desperate flight; 25,000 of
them were left on the field. The French had lost 8,000, but they had won
a decisive victory over the only Russian army then available to meet
invasion. Russians and Prussians fled to Tilsit, losing so many hundreds
to their French pursuers that their generals, Alexander permitting,
asked for a truce. Napoleon granted it; then, leaving General Savary to
hold and govern Konigsberg, he himself proceeded to Tilsit to make peace
with a broken King and a chas- tened Czar.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>TILSIT: JUNE 25 -JULY 9, 1807</li>
</ol>
<p>At Tilsit, some sixty miles southeast of Konigsberg, the rival armies
peace- fully faced each other on opposite sides of the River Niemen, and
“a friendly understanding grew up between them”; 36 the rival Emperors,
however, at Alexander’s suggestion, met cautiously in a tent on a raft
moored in the middle of the stream. Each ruler was rowed to the raft;
Napoleon reached it first (as every French soldier had expected), and
had time to walk through the tent and welcome Alexander on the other
side. They embraced, and the opposed armies joined in a lusty cheer; “it
was a beautiful sight,” said eye - witness Meneval.</p>
<p>Each rul er had reasons for being amiable: Napoleon’s army was in no
condition (in number or equipment, or in the security of its rear, or in
the support it might expect from a France crying out for peace) to
invade an unknown land almost limitless in space and men; and Alexander
— disgusted with the weakness of his allies and his troops, fearful of
insurrection in his Polish or Lithuanian provinces, and hody embroiled
with Turkey and his troops — was glad to get a breathing spell before
undertaking to defeat a man who (excepting Acre) had never yet been
overcome. Besides, this French- man who had been playing chess with the
map of Europe was not the “mon - ster” and “barbarian” described by the
Czarina and the Konigin, but an en - gagingly courteous fellow whose
hospitality was unobtrusive but complete. After tnat first meeting,
Alexander readily agreed that their further confer- ences should be held
in Tilsit town, in commodious quarters arranged by Napoleon and near his
own. Often they dined at his table, sometimes with Prussia’s King, later
with its Queen. For a time the Czar made himself a pupil, asking the
Corsican to instruct him in the art of government, and agreeing with him
that Louis XVIII (then living in Courland) lacked all the qualities
neede d in a sovereign, and “was the most insignificant nullity in
Europe.” 37</p>
<p>Each of the Emperors thought the other charming and deceivable. After
apparently amiable negotiations, they signed not only a treaty but an
alli- ance. Russia was to keep her present possessions intact, but she
would end her cooperation with England, and would join France in
maintaining peace</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>THE NEW EMPIRE</p>
<p>2I 3</p>
<p>on the Continent. By a secret agreement Russia was to be free to take
Fin- land from Sweden (which had been hostile to France since 1792), and
France was to be free to conquer Portugal, which had become an outpost
of England in the war. Alexander pledged himself to mediate a
satisfactory peace between England and France, and, if this failed, to
join France in opposing England with blockade and war. This pledge
delighted Napoleon, for he valued the cooperation of Russia in the
blockade far above any acqui- sition of terrain.</p>
<p>Unprepared to sacrifice these agreements, and to undertake a war i
outrance with Russia, Prussia, and Austria, Napoleon put aside as
impracti- cable the idea of restoring Poland to her pre-partition
boundaries, and con- tented himself with establishing, out of Prussia’s
part of Poland, a grand duchy of Warsaw under a French protectorate. For
this new state of two million persons he drew up (July 22, 1807) a
constitution which abolished serfdom, made all citizens equal before the
law, required public trials before juries, and prescribed the Napoleonic
Code as the basis of legislation and justice. The liberum veto, the
feudal dues, and the faineant diet were abol- ished; the legislative
power was to be vested in a senate of notables and a house of a hundred
deputies; the executive, for the time being, was to be the King of
Saxony, who was descended from former rulers of Poland. It was an
enlightened constitution in terms of its place and time.</p>
<p>Generous to the Czar, Napoleon was merciless to the Prussian King who
had broken his alliance with France to join her enemies. Frederick Wil-
liam III was required to surrender all Prussian territory west of the
Elbe; most of this was reconstituted as the grand duchy of Berg and the
kingdom of Westphalia. Nearly all of Prussian Poland went to the grand
duchy of Warsaw, except that Danzig was made a free city under a French
garrison. The surviving half of Prussia was to close its doors to
British trade, was to join in war upon England if called upon, and was
to be occupied by French forces until a heavy indemnity had been fully
paid. Frederick William, who had not wanted the war, was emotionally
stunned by these terms. Queen Louise, who had almost begotten the war,
rushed up from Berlin (July 6), and appealed to Napoleon, with
arguments, perfumes, smiles, and tears to soften his demands. He cooled
her eloquence by offering her a chair (from which it is hard to be
eloquent), and explained that someone had to pay for the war; and why
not the government which, to wage it, had broken its treaty — at her
behest? He sent her away with polite refusals, and on the next day
ordered Talleyrand to conclude the treaties as previously formulated.
The Queen went back to Berlin brokenhearted, and died within three
years, at the age of thirty-four.</p>
<p>On July 9 the Emperors parted, each feeling that he had made a good
bargain: Alexander had Russia, security on the west, and a free hand in
Fin- land and Turkey; Napoleon had Berg, Westphalia, and a precarious
truce. Years l ater he defined a “congress of the Powers” as “deceit
agreed upon be - tween diplomats; it is the pen of Machiavelli combined
with the sword of Mahomet.” 38 The next day he left for Paris, where he
was received with</p>

<p>hosannas of public gratitude not so much for his victories as for
bringing peace. His report to the Corps Legislatif on the state of the
nation in 1807 was one of his proudest: Austria chastened, Prussia
punished, Russia brought from enmity to alliance, new lands added to the
Empire, 123,000 captives — and all expenses paid for by the defeated
aggressors, without any rise of taxes in France. 39</p>
<p>He announced, among many promotions, the elevation of Talleyrand to
prince of Benevento. This brought the esurient abbe an added income of
120,000 francs, but it required his resignation as minister of foreign
affairs, since protocol held that a ministry was beneath the dignity of
a prince. In this way a difficult situation was eased, for Napoleon had
come to distrust his brilliant but stealthy diplomat, and yet hesitated
to antagonize him by a dismissal; indeed, he continued to use him in
several major negotiations. After instructing his successor,
Jean-Baptiste de Champagny, in the ways and wiles of his new office,
Talleyrand was free to enjoy life at the luxurious chateau that he had
bought at Valengay, partly with Napoleon’s money.</p>
<p>On August 15 the court celebrated Napoleon’s triumph with a fete re -
calling the splendor of the Grand Monarque: a concert, a ballet, an
opera, and a reception attended by kings and ministers in formal
costumes, and by women bearing fortunes in gowns and gems. Four days
later he signalized his augmented royalty by abolishing the Tribunate,
where a minority had for years dared to oppose his views and decrees. He
softened the blow by appointing several harmless tribunes to
administrative posts, and by merging most of the others with the Corps
Legislatif, which now acquired the right to discuss measures as well as
to vote. The surviving and returned Emigres, in the reanimated palaces
of the Faubourg St.-Germain, applauded Napoleon as almost worthy of
noble birth. “Why isn’t he legitimate?” they asked one another; then
France would be perfect. Rarely again would he be so popular, powerful,
and content.</p>
