<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>Literature and the Stage</p>
<p>I7H-5 6</p>
<p>I. THE REALM OF INK</p>
<p>E NGLAND was throbbing if not with literature at least with
print.</p>
<p>Not only had population grown, especially in the towns and above</p>
<p>all in London, but literacy had spread as a necessity of commerce and
in- dustry and city life. The burgeoning bourgeoisie took to books as a
dis- tinction and a relief; women took to books and thereby gave
audience and motives to Richardson and the novel. The reading public was
further expanded by circulating libraries, of which the first on record
was set up in 1 740; soon there were twenty-two in London alone. The
collective mid- dle class began to replace the individual aristocrat as
the patron of literature; so Johnson could flout Chesterfield.
Government subsidies no longer — as formerly with Addison, Swift, and
Defoe — commanded superior pens through political plums.</p>
<p>The bitter conflicts of Whigs and Tories, of Hanoverians and
Jacobites, and the increasing involvement of England in Continental and
colonial affairs whetted the appetite for news, and made the newspaper a
force in British history. In 1714 there were eleven newspapers regularly
published in London, most of them weekly; in 1733 there were seventeen,
in 1776 fifty-three. Many of them were subsidized by political factions;
for as demos raised its voice moneyed minorities bought newspapers to
dictate its thoughts. Nearly all newspapers contained advertisements.
The Daily Ad- vertiser, founded in 1730, was at first given over
entirely to advertisements; but soon, like our morning Leviathans, it
added a fillip of news to bolster its circulation and raise its
advertising fees. Some historic magazines were born in this period: The
Craftsman (1726), Bolingbroke’s scourge of Wal - pole; The Grub Street
Journal (1730-37), the sharp tongue of Pope; The Gentleman’s Magazine
(1731), which gave Johnson a berth; and The Edin- burgh Review (1755),
which died only temporarily in 1756. Many Eng- lish newspapers and
journals are still alive after two hundred years of publication.</p>
<p>All these periodicals — daily, weekly, or monthly — gave the press a
power that added something to the perils and vitality of British life.
Robert Wal- pole, while forbidding the publication of parliamentary
debates, allowed</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>journalists to attack him with all the virulence of
eighteenth-century litera- ture. Montesquieu, coming from censored
France, marveled at the liberty with which Grub Street pelted Downing
Street with poisoned ink. 1 A member of Parliament complained to the
Commons in 1738 that</p>
<p>the people of Great Britain are governed by a power that never was
heard of, as a supreme authority, in any age or country before. This
power, Sir, does not consist in the absolute will of the prince, in the
direction of Parliament, in the strength of an army, in the influence of
the clergy; it is the government of the press. The stuff which our
weekly newspapers are filled with is received with greater reverence
than Acts of Parliament; and the sentiments of these scribblers have
more weight with the multitude than the opinion of the best politicians
in the</p>
<p>Kingdom. 2</p>
<p>Printers worked with new fury to meet the widened demand. In London
there were 150, in all England three hundred; two of them in this age,
Wil- liam Caslon and John Baskerville, left their names on fonts of
type. Print- ing, publishing, and bookselling were still in most cases
united in the same firm. One living firm, Longmans, was born in 1724.
The word publisher usually denoted the author; the man who brought out
the book was the bookseller. Some booksellers, like Johnson’s father,
carried their wares to</p>
<p>Under these conditions of risk the booksellers drove hard bargains
with authors. Usually the writer sold his copyright for a flat sum; if
the volume went unexpectedly well, the bookseller might give the author
an added sum, but this was not obligatory. For a book by a known author
the fee ranged from one hundred to two hundred pounds; Hume received the
ex- ceptionally high price of five hundred pounds per volume for his
History of England. An author might take subscriptions for his work, as
Pope did for his translation of the Iliad; usually in such cases the
subscriber paid half the purchase price in advance and the other half on
delivery, and the author paid the printer.</p>
<p>The great majority of authors lived in a galling poverty. Simon
Ockley, after working for a decade on his History of the Saracens
(1708-57), had</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>to complete it in a debtors’ prison; Richard Savage used to tr amp
the streets at night for lack of a lodging; Johnson was poor for thirty
years before he became the sovereign of English letters. Grub (now
Milton) Street was the historic habitat of “poetry and poverty”
(Johnson’s phrase), where hack writers — journalists, translators,
compilers, proofreaders, magazine contributors, editors — sometimes
slept three in a bed and dressed in a blan- ket for want of other
clothes. This poverty was due not so much to the tightness of
booksellers and the indifference of Walpole as to the unprece- dented
glutting of the literary market by mediocre talents underselling one
another. The predominance of failures over successes in the “word busi -
ness” shared with the divorce of literature from aristocratic patronage
in debasing the social status of authors. At the same time when in
France poets, philosophers, and historians were being welcomed into the
fanciest homes and bosoms, in England — with two or three exceptions —
they were excluded from “polite society” as unwa shed bohemians. Perhaps
that was why Congreve begged Voltaire not to class him as a writer.
Alexander Pope challenged the prejudices of his time by claiming to be
both a poet and a gentleman. By the latter word he meant a man of
“gentle birth,” not a ma n of gentle ways. On the contrary!</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ALEXANDER POPE: 1 688-1 744</li>
</ol>
<p>Johnson, who despised biographies that begin with a pedigree and end
with a funeral, began his remarkable biography of Pope by telling us
that “Alexander Pope was born in London May 22, 1688, of parents whose
rank or status was never ascertained.” 3 The father was a linen merchant
who made a modest fortune and then retired to Binfield, near Windsor
Forest. Both parents were Roman Catholics, and the year of Pope’s birth
was also the year when the dethronement of James II dashed the hopes of
Catholics for the abatement of the anti-Catholic laws. The mother was
especially gen- tle to the boy, who was her only child. He inherited
from her a tendency to headaches, and from his father such curvature of
the spine that he never grew beyond four and a half feet in height.</p>
<p>His early education was entrusted to Catholic priests, who made him
proficient in Latin, and less so in Greek; other tutors taught him
French and Italian. As his religion closed the universities and the
professions to him, he continued his studies at home; and as his crooked
figure and frail health handicapped him for active enterprise, his
parents indulged his fondness for writing poetry. He tells us that</p>
<p>As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,</p>
<p>I lisp’d in numbers, for the numbers name. 4</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>At twelve he had a glimpse of Dryden pontificating in Will’s
Coffeehouse; the sight stirred in him a wild desire for literary glory.
At sixteen he com- posed some Pastorals which circulated in manuscript
and won intoxicating praise; they were accepted for publication in 1709.
Then, in 17 1 1, in all the ripe wisdom of his twenty-three years, he
astonished the wits of London with an Essay on Criticism in which — even
while warning authors,</p>
<p>A little learning is a dangerous thing;</p>
<p>Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring 5</p>
<p>of the Muses — he laid down with magisterial finality the rules of
literary art. Here Horace’s Ars poetica and Boileau’s Art poetique were
digested into 744 lines of good sense marvelously, often
monosyllabically, phrased —</p>
<p>What oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed. 6</p>
<p>The youth had a flair for epigram, for compressing reams of wisdom in
a line, and rounding each idea with a rhyme. He took his versification
from Dryden, but his theory from Boileau. Having leisure to file his
verse, he readily accepted the classic counsel to perfect the form, to
make the goblet more precious than its wine. Though still professing the
Catholic faith, he adopted Boileau’s doctrine that literature should be
reason aptly dressed. Nature yes, but nature tamed by man; feeling yes,
but chastened by intelli- gence. And what better guide could there be to
such controlled and chis- eled art than the practice of the ancient
poets and orators, their resolution to be rational, and to make each
part of every work an orderly element in- tegrated into a harmonious
whole? Here was the classic tradition, coming down through Italy and
France, through Petrarch and Corneille, and now conquering England
through Alexander Pope, as it seemed to Voltaire to have conquered
Shakespeare through Addison’s Cato , and as classic architecture, coming
down through Palladio and Serlio, through Perrault and Wren, had
overlaid or overridden Gothic fantasies and exaltation with sober
pediments and calm colonnades. So was formed the young poet’s con - cept
of the classic mind functioning in an ideal critic: .</p>
<p>But whe re’s the man, who counsel can bestow,</p>
<p>Still pleased to teach, and yet not proud to know?</p>
<p>Unbias’d or by favor or by spite;</p>
<p>Not dully prepossessed, nor blindly right;</p>
<p>Though learn’d, well -bred, and though well-bred, sincere;</p>
<p>Modestly bold and humanly severe;</p>
<p>Who to a friend his faults can freely show,</p>
<p>And gladly praise the merits of a foe?</p>
<p>l66 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>Blest with a taste exact yet unconfined,</p>
<p>A knowledge both of books and human kind;</p>
<p>Gen’rous converse; a soul exempt from pride;</p>
<p>And love to praise, with reason on his side? 7</p>
<p>There were a few such critics ready to hail such verse and measured
virtue from a lad of twenty-three; so Addison, who must have felt
himself here described, offered the poet, in No. 253 of The Spectator, a
precious acclaim soon to be forgotten in wordy wars. Another poet, John
Dennis, author of the play Appius and Virginia, thought himself abused
in Pope’s uncautious lines,</p>
<p>But Appius reddens at each word you speak,</p>
<p>And stares, tremendous, with a threatening eye,</p>
<p>Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry, 8</p>
<p>and countered with Reflections, Critical and Satirical (1711). He
picked real flaws in Pope’s thought and diction, and served them up in
peppered sauce. He described Pope as an ugly hypocrite shaped like
Cupid’s bow or a hunchbacked toad, and congratulated him on not having
been born in classic Greece, which would have exposed him at birth for
his deformity. 9 Pope licked his wounds and bided his time.</p>
<p>He followed up his success by publishing The Rape of the Lock (1712).
It was a frank imitation of Boileau’s Le Lutrin (1674), but by general
con - sent it excelled its original. Lord Robert Petre had expressed his
enthusiasm for Mrs. Arabella Fermor by cutting off, and running off
with, a lock of her lovely hair. A coolness ensued between raper and
rapee. A Mr. Caryll suggested to Pope that Arabella’s resentment might
soften if the poet would tell the story in humorous verse and present
the poem to her. It was so done and it so transpired; Mrs. Fermor
forgave the lord, and consented to the publication of the poem. But then
Pope, against the advice of Addison, en- larged and cluttered the lay
with mock-heroic machinery of participating sylphs, salamanders, nymphs,
and gnomes. This “light militia of the lower sky” fell in with the
fancies of the time, and the amended Rape proved a success with everyone
but Dennis. George Berkeley paused in his campaign against matter to
compliment the author on the flexibility of his Muse. All the felicity
of Pope’s versification, and his inexhaustible mint of imagery and
phrase make the poem sparkle like the gems in “Belinda’s” hair. He
describes with feminine learning the cosmetics with which a fairy arms
the heroine for the wars of love, and he lists with sarcastic
equivalents the vital issues of her day:</p>
<p>Whether the nymph 〔Belinda- Arabella〕 shall break Diana’s</p>
<p>law 〔of virginity〕,</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>Or some frail china-jar receive a flaw;</p>
<p>Or stain her honor, or her new brocade;</p>
<p>Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;</p>
<p>Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball . . . 10</p>
<p>Belinda joins the gossip and gambling of titled company at Hampton
Court, where</p>
<p>At every word a reputation dies ; 11</p>
<p>and the poet marshals his artistry to recount a game of cards. Then,
as Belinda bends to drink, the lusty baron snips her curl and steals
away (this iambic flux is catching). Furious, she pursues and finds him,
and throws a charge of snuff into his face;</p>
<p>Sudden, with starting tears each eye o’erflows.</p>
<p>And the high dome re-echoes to his nose . 12</p>
<p>Meanwhile the gnomes, or sylphs, or salamanders themselves rape the
lock and draw it, trailing clouds of glory, to the skies, where it
becomes a comet outcoruscating Berenice’s hair.</p>
<p>All this delighted the lords and ladies, the clubs and coffeehouses,
of London; Pope found himself hailed as the cleverest poet in England;
and all other poets became his foes. He added nothing to his fame with
weari- some verses describing Windsor Forest (1713); nor did the Whigs,
vic- torious in 1714, forget that in that poem he revealed his Catholic
sympathies for the fallen dynasty. 13 But he recaptured his audience in
1717 by carving into couplets the fabled letters of Heloise and Abelard.
“Eloi’sa,” self - immured in a nunnery, bids the emasculated “Abelard”
flaunt the laws of Church and state and come to her arms:</p>
<p>Come, if thou dar’st, all charming as thou art!</p>
<p>Oppose thyself to Heaven, dispute my heart;</p>
<p>Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes</p>
<p>Blot out each bright idea of the skies; . . .</p>
<p>Snatch me, just mounting, from the bless’d abode;</p>
<p>Assist the friends, and tear me from my God!</p>
<p>Then in another mood she tells him,</p>
<p>No, fly me, far as pole from pole;</p>
<p>Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!</p>
<p>Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,</p>
<p>Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee . 14</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>1 68</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>Yet she trusts that in her dying hour he may come to her, not as a
lover but as a priest:</p>
<p>In sacred vestments may’st thou stand,</p>
<p>The hallow’d taper trembling in thy hand,</p>
<p>Present the cross before my lifted eye,</p>
<p>Teach me at once, and learn of me, to die. 15</p>
<p>Like almost every poet in those days Pope dreamed of writing an epic.
He had begun one at the age of twelve. Later, studying Homer, the
thought came to him that he might translate the Iliad into those “heroic
couplets” that seemed to be almost his natural speech. He asked his
friends about the idea; they approved. One of them, Jonathan Swift,
introduced him to Har- ley, Bolingbroke, and other heads of government,
hoping to get him a sus- taining sinecure. Failing in this, he undertook
to get subscriptions that would support the new Alexander prancing over
Troy. Strategically placed between place seekers and ministry, Swift
proclaimed that “the best poet in England was Mr. Pope, a Papist, who
had begun a translation of Homer into English verse, for which he must
have them all subscribe; for the author shall not begin to print till I
have a thousand guineas for him!” 16 Pope proposed to render the Iliad
in six volumes quarto, for six guineas (80?) the set. Despite this
lordly price the subscriptions were so many, and the enthusiasm so
great, that Bernard Lintot, bookseller, agreed to pay Pope two hundred
pounds for each volume, and to supply him gratuitously with copies for
his subscribers. As the 575 subscribers took 654 sets, Pope earned £
5,320 (48,960?) for the Iliad. No author in England had yet received so
handsome a sum. The first volume, containing four cantos, ap- peared in
1715. It encountered unexpected competition from the publica- tion, on
the same day, of a translation of Canto I by Thomas Tickell. Addi- son
lauded Tickell’s version, which Pope took to be really Addison’s; he
felt the simultaneous publication to be an unfriendly act, and added
Addi- son to his foes.</p>
<p>If scholarship had been the only test, Pope’s translation would have
de - served little praise. He had only a modest knowledge of Greek; he
had to engage scholastic help; he accomplished most of his task by
collating earlier translations and rephrasing them in the
iambic-pentameter couplets that were his special forte. Bentley, prince
of then living Hellenists, judged the performance well: “A pretty poem,
Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.” 17 The couplets and the
drumbeat of their rhymes, the balanced phrases, clauses, and antitheses,
halted the swift and surging style of the Greek hexameters. Nevertheless
there was a marching grandeur, and a re- source of language, in those
marvelously sustained verses that carried them over Bentley’s protests
through the eighteenth into the nineteenth century</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>as the favored translation of the Iliad. “The noblest version of
poetry that the world has ever seen,” said Johnson; 18 no other
translation would ever equal it, said Gray. 19 So Britain judged until
Keats looked into Chapman’s Homer, and Wordsworth called down a plague
upon the pompous artificial style that pleased so many in England’s
Augustan Age.</p>
<p>Pope’s Iliad was published in 1715 -20. Its success brought competing
booksellers to his door. One of them begged him to edit Shakespeare’s
plays; he foolishly agreed, blind to the chasm that divided him from
Shake- speare in mind and art. He toiled impatiently at the uncongenial
task; the edition appeared in 1725, and was soon riddled as incompetent
by Lewis Theobald, the best Shakespearean scholar of the day. Pope
crucified him in The Dunciad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lintot persua’dgd him to translate the Odyssey, offering a
hundred pounds for each of five volumes; and subscribers took 819 sets.
But now, lacking the stimulus of youth and need, Pope tired of cutting
couplets, and delegated half the work to two Cambridge scholars, who
soon learned to counterfeit his style. He had forewarned subscribers
that he would use aides; but in publishing his Odyssey (1725-26) — far
inferior to his Iliad — he credited these assistants with five books of
the twenty-four; actually they had translated twelve. 20 He paid them
^770; he himself netted £ 3,500, rightly feeling that his name had sold
the book. The two translations made him financially independent. Now,
“thanks to Homer,” he said, he could “live and thrive indebted to no
prince or peer alive.” 21</p>
<p>In 1718 he bought a villa at Twickenham, with a garden of five acres
sloping to the Thames. He desi gned the garden in “natural” style,
avoiding the classical regularity that he practiced in his verse; “a
tree,” he said, “is a nobler object than a prince in his coronation
robes.” 22 From his house he had a tunnel dug under an intervening
highway to emerge into the garden; this “grotto” he decorated fancifully
with shells, crystals, coral, petrifacts, mirrors, and little obelisks.
In that cool retreat he entertained many fa- mous friends — Swift, Gay,
Congreve, Bolingbroke, Arbuthnot, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Princess
Caroline, and Voltaire. Lady Mary was his neighbor in what they both
called “Twitnam”; Bolingbroke lived at Daw - ley, close by; London was
only eleven miles away, by a pleasant boat ride on the Thames; and
nearer still were the royal palaces at Richmond, Hamp- ton Court, and
Kew.</p>
<p>Dr. John Arbuthnot, whose History of John Bull (1712) had given Eng-
land a personality and a name, joined Swift, Congreve, Gay, and Pope in
the famous Scriblerus Club (17 13-15), dedicated to ridiculing every
kind of quackery and ineptitude. All their victims were added to the
swelling roster of Pope’s foes. With Lady Mary he had a half -real,
half-literary ro- mance that ended in bitter enmity. Swift sometimes
stayed with him, as</p>

<p>when publishing Gulliver (1726); the two exchanged misanthropies, and
some letters that revealed the tenderness under their carapaces. 23
Pope’s acquaintance with Bolingbroke began about 1713, and developed
into a philosophical tutelage. Each paid the other fulsome compliments.
“I really think,” said Pope, “that there is something in that great man
which looks as if it were placed here by mistake from some higher
sphere”; and Boling - broke, when Pope was dying, said, “I have k nown
him these thirty years, and value myself more on this man’s love”—
whereat, we are told, his voice failed. 24</p>
<p>There must have been something to love in this poet whom tradition,
and sometimes his own pen, have pictured as quarrelsome, deceitful,
mean, and vain. We should always remember that he was forgivably
embittered by the daily humiliation of his physical disabilities. In
early life he had been beautiful of face, and of pleasant temper; and
his face always remained attractive, if only by the animation of his
eyes. But as he grew up the cur- vature of his spine became more
painfully pronounced. He described him- self as “a lively little
creature, with long legs and arms; a spider is no ill emblem of him; he
has bee n taken at a distance for a small windmill.” 25 (We are reminded
of the pitiful Scarron.) At table, to be on a level with others, he had
to be propped up on a raised seat like a child. He required almost
constant attendance. He could not go to bed or get up without help;
could not dress or undress himself; had difficulty in keeping himself
clean. On rising he could scarce hold himself erect until his servant
laced him in a bodice of stiff canvas. His legs were so thin that he
wore three pairs of stockings to enlarge their size and keep them warm.
He was so sensitive to cold that he wore “a kind of fur doublet” under a
shirt of coarse warm linen. He rarely knew the zest of health. Lord
Bathurst said of him that he had headaches four days a week, and was
sick the other three. It is a marvel that Jonathan Richardson could have
painted so presentable a por- trait of Pope 29 — all alertness and
sensitivity; but in the bust by Roubiliac 27 we can see the tortured
body torturing the mind.</p>
<p>It would be cruel to expect such a man to be even-tempered,
complaisant, cheerful, or kind. Like any invalid he became irritable,
demanding, and morose; he seldom came closer to laughter than a smile.
Deprived of all physical charm, he comforted himself with pride of place
and vanity of intellect. Like a weak or wounded animal, and as one of an
oppressed mi- nority, he developed cunning, evasion, and subtlety; he
soon learned to lie, even to practice dishonesty with his friends. He
flattered the aristocracy, but he scorned to write acquisitive
dedications. He had the courage to refuse a pension offered him by a
government that he despised.</p>
<p>We see some lovable qualities in his private life. Swift called him
“the</p>
<p>CHAP. V) LITERATURE AND THE STAGE 1 7 1</p>
<p>most dutiful son I have ever known or heard of.” 28 His affection for
his mother was the purest and most lasting sentiment of his troubled
spirit; in her ninety-first year he wrote that her daily company made
him insensitive to any lack of other domestic attachments. His sexual
morals were better in practice than in speech; his frame was not adapted
to fornication, but his tongue and pen could be licentious ad nauseam .
29 Even to the two women with whom he thought he was in love he wrote
with a loose freedom that none but a trull would tolerate today. And yet
one of these, Martha Blount, developed for the infirm poet a devotion
that gossip mistook for a liaison. In 1730 he described her as “a friend
. . . with whom I have spent three - came dependent upon her affection,
and he bequeathed to her nearly all of his substantial estate.</p>
<p>Always conscious of his bodily defects, he felt with double keenness
every word critical of his character or his poetry. It was an age
pre-</p>
<p>eminent in the vindictiveness of its literary wars; and Pope returned
abuse with abuse sometimes unfit to print. In 1728 he gathered his foes
and critics into the corral of his verse, and let loose upon them all
the arrows of his wrath in his most powerful and disagreeable work. It
was anonymous, but all literate London saw his signature in its style.
Treading the rugged path of Dry den’s MacFlecknoe (1682), Pope’s Dunciad
hailed the scribes of Grub Street as the leading dunces of the Court of
Dullness, where Theo- bald is king. He mourned the death of Wren and
Gay, and the Hiberniat- ing exile of Swift, who was dying “like a
poisoned rat in a hole”— i.e., Dublin Cathedral. For the rest he saw
nothing about him but a venal and tasteless mediocrity. Theobald,
Dennis, Blackmore, Osborne, Curll, Cibber, Oldmixon, Smedley, Arnall
received in turn their meed of lashes, taunts, and filth — for the poet,
perhaps as an attribute of impotence, had a flair for offal. 31</p>
<p>In a later edition Pope, through the mouth of the poet Savage, told
with pleasure how, on the date of first publication, a crowd of authors
besieged the bookseller, threatening him with violence if he published
the poem; how this made the public more avid for copies; how one edition
after an- other was demanded and consumed; how the victims formed clubs
to con- cert vengeance upon Pope, and destroyed him in effigy. Dennis’
son came with a cudgel to beat Pope, but was diverted by Lord Bathurst;
thereafter, for a while, Pope took with him on his walks two pistols and
his great Dane. Several victims countered with pamphlets; Pope and his
friends started (1730) The Grub Street Journal to continue the war. In
1742 he issued a fourth book of The Dunciad, in which, hungry for new
enemies, he attacked the pedagogues and the freethinkers — who boast
that</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>We nobly take the high Priori Road,</p>
<p>And reason downward till we doubt of God;</p>
<p>Make Nature still encroach upon His plan,</p>
<p>And shove Him off as far as e’er we can; . . .</p>
<p>Or, at one bound o’erleaping all His laws,</p>
<p>Make God man’s image, man the final cause,</p>
<p>Find virtue local, all relation scorn,</p>
<p>See all in self, and but for self be born;</p>
<p>Of nought so certain as our reason still,</p>
<p>Of nought so doubtful as of soul and will. 32</p>
<p>Obviously Pope had been delving into philosophy, and not only with
Bolingbroke; Hume’s dissolvent Treatise of Human Nature had appeared in
1739, three years before this Book IV of The Dunciad . There is some
evidence that the Viscount had already transmitted to the poet the deism
of Shaftesbury sharpened with the wisdom of the world. 33 Enough of
satire and trivialities, said Bolingbroke; turn your Muse to divine
philosophy. “Lord Bathurst,” reported Joseph Warton, “repeatedly assured
me that he had read the whole scheme of the Essay 〔on Man〕 in the
handwriting of Bolingbroke, and drawn up in a series of propositions
which Pope was to versify and illustrate.” 34 Pope seems to have done
this, even to using specific phrases of the lordly skeptic, 35 but he
added some saving remnants of his Christian creed. So he issued his
Essay on Man: Epistle I in February, 1733; Epistles II and III later in
that year; Epistle IV in 1734. Soon it was trans- lated into French, and
a dozen Gauls hailed it as one of the most brilliant unions of poetry
and philosophy ever composed.</p>
<p>Today it is remembered chiefly for lines that everyone knows; let us
do Pope the justice to see them in the setting of his art and thought.
He begins with an apostrophe to Bolingbroke:</p>
<p>Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things</p>
<p>To low ambition and the pride of kings.</p>
<p>Let us (since life can little more supply</p>
<p>Than just to look about us and to die)</p>
<p>Expatiate free o’er all this scene of man;</p>
<p>A mighty maze! but not without a plan; . . .</p>
<p>Together let us beat this ample field, . . .</p>
<p>Laugh where we must, be candid where we can,</p>
<p>But vindicate the ways of God to man. 36</p>
<p>Here, of course, is a memory of Leibniz’ Theodicy and Milton’s
Paradise Lost . 37 Pope proceeds to warn philosophers against hoping or
pretending to understand — “Can a part contain the whole?” Let us be
grateful that our reason is limited and our future unknown:</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today,</p>
<p>Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?</p>
<p>Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,</p>
<p>And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood . 38</p>
<p>There is a secret pessimism here; hope can survive only through
ignorance:</p>
<p>Hope humbly, then; with trembling pinions soar;</p>
<p>Wait the great teacher, Death, and God adore.</p>
<p>What future bliss He gives not thee to know,</p>
<p>But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal in the human breast,</p>
<p>Man never Is, but always To be, blest . 39</p>
<p>We cannot see the reason for the apparent injustices of life; we must
recog- nize that nature is not made for man, that God must order all
things for all things, not for man alone. Pope describes the “vast Chain
of Being” be - tween the lowest creatures through man and angel to God,
and he keeps his faith in a divine order, however hidden from our
ken:</p>
<p>All Nature is but art, unknown to thee;</p>
<p>All chance, direction which thou canst not see;</p>
<p>All discord, harmony not understood;</p>
<p>All partial evil, universal good;</p>
<p>And, spite of pride, in erring reason’s spite,</p>
<p>One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right . 40</p>
<p>The first lesson is intellectual humility. Then a magnificent
remembrance of Pascal:</p>
<p>Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;</p>
<p>The proper study of mankind is man.</p>
<p>Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,</p>
<p>A being darkly wise, and rudely great, . . .</p>
<p>Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl’d:</p>
<p>The glory, jest, and riddle of the world ! 41</p>
<p>Within these human limits let us agree that “self -love, the spring
of mo- tion, act〔ivate〕s the soul,” but also that reason must enter to
give order and balance to our passions and save us from vice. For</p>
<p>Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,</p>
<p>As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;</p>
<p>Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</p>
<p>We first endure, then pity, then embrace . 42</p>
<p>*74</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>These passions, though they are all modes of self-love, are parts of
the di- vine design, and may tend to an end good even to our blind
vision. So the lust for the flesh continues the race, and mutual
interest begot society. So- cial organization and religious belief are
obvious boons, though kings and creeds have stained history with human
blood.</p>
<p>For forms of government let fools contest;</p>
<p>Whate’er is best ad ministered is best.</p>
<p>For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;</p>
<p>His can’t be wrong whose life is in the right. 43</p>
<p>The fourth epistle of the Essay on Man examines happiness, and labors
to equate it with virtue. If the good man suffers misfortunes, and the
wicked sometimes prosper, it is because</p>
<p>the Universal Cause</p>
<p>Acts not by partial but by general laws; 44</p>
<p>God ordains the whole, but leaves the parts to the laws of nature and
to man’s free will. Some of us mourn the inequality of possessions as a
source of unhappiness; but class divisions are necessary to
government;</p>
<p>Order is Heaven’s first law; and this confessed,</p>
<p>Some are, and must be, greater than the rest. 45</p>
<p>This is not as clear as a day in June, but what else could be said to
(or by?) Viscount Bolingbroke? And despite the inequality of natural and
acquired gifts, happiness is evenly distributed; the poor man is quite
as happy as the king. Nor is the prosperous villain really happy; he
hugs his gains but feels the world’s contempt, while the just man, even
in injustice, has a soul at peace.</p>
<p>What strikes us first in the Essay on Man is the unrivaled
compactness of the style. “I chose verse,” said Pope, “because I found I
could express them 〔ideas〕 more shortly this way than in prose.” 46 No
one, not Shakespeare</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>1 75</p>
<p>Many critics assailed the poem as versified humanism. “The proper
study of mankind is man” defined one aspect of humanism, and seemed to
scuttle all theology. When the Essay was translated into French it was
pounced upon by a Swiss pastor, Jean Crousaz, who argued that Pope had
left God off on a siding in a poem supposed to vindicate the ways of God
to man. No other than the potent William Warburton came to Pope’s
defense against this alien attack; the poem, vouched the future bishop,
was a work of impeccable Christian piety. To calm the clergy Pope
published in 1738 a lovely hymn, “The Universal Prayer.” The orthodox
were not quite</p>
<p>satisfied, but the storm died down. On the Continent the Essay was
hailed with hyperboles; “in my opinion,” Voltaire judged, “the finest,
the most useful, the sublimest didactic poem that has ever been written
in any language.” 47</p>
<p>In 1735 Pope prefaced a volume of satires with an “Epistle to Dr. Ar
- buthnot,” defending his life and works, and dispatching further
enemies. Here came the famous picture of Addison as “Atticus,” and the m
urderous exposure of the ambisexual Lord Hervey, who had made the
mistake of calling Pope “hard as thy heart, and as thy birth obscure.”
48 Pope trans - fixed him as “Sporus” in lines that show the poet at his
best and worst:</p>
<p>What? that thing of silk,</p>
<p>Sporus, that mere white curd of ass’s milk?</p>
<p>Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel,</p>
<p>Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?</p>
<p>Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings,</p>
<p>This painted child of dirt, that stinks and stings . . .</p>
<p>Whether in florid impotence he speaks,</p>
<p>And as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;</p>
<p>Or, at the ear of Eve, familiar toad,</p>
<p>Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad,</p>
<p>In puns, or politics, or tales, or lies,</p>
<p>Or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies,</p>
<p>His wit all seesaw, between that and this,</p>
<p>Now high, now low, now master up, now miss,</p>
<p>And he himself one vile antithesis.</p>
<p>Amphibious thing! that acting either part,</p>
<p>The trifling head, or the corrupted heart,</p>
<p>Fop at the toilet, flatterer at the board,</p>
<p>Now trips a lady, and now struts a lord. 49</p>
<p>Pope was proud of his facility in such assassinations —</p>
<p>Yes, I am proud; I must be proud to see</p>
<p>Men, not afraid of God, afraid of me. 50</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>He excused his bitterness on the ground that the age was threatened
with the triumph of stupidity, and needed a scorpion to sting it into
sense. But in 1743 he concluded that he had lost the battle; in his last
revision of The Dunciad he painted a powerful picture — Donne’s
forebodings in Miltonic tones — of religion, morals, order, and art in
universal darkness and decline. The Goddess of Dullness, enthroned,
yawns upon a dying world:</p>
<p>She comes! she comes! The sable throne behold</p>
<p>Of night primeval and of Chaos old!</p>
<p>Before her, fancy’s gilded clouds decay,</p>
<p>And all its varying rainbows die away. . . .</p>
<p>As one by one, at dread Medea’s strain,</p>
<p>The sick’ning stars fade off th’ ethereal plain; . . .</p>
<p>Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,</p>
<p>Art after art goes out, and all is night.</p>
<p>See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,</p>
<p>Mountains of casuistry heaped o’er her head!</p>
<p>Philosophy, that leaned on Heaven before,</p>
<p>Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.</p>
<p>Physic 〔science〕 of metaphysic begs defense 〔against Hume?〕,</p>
<p>And metaphysic calls for aid on Sense 〔Locke? 〕 !</p>
<p>See mystery to mathematics 〔Newton?〕 fly!</p>
<p>In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.</p>
<p>Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,</p>
<p>And unawares morality expires. . . .</p>
<p>Lo, thy dread empire, Chaos! is restored;</p>
<p>Light dies before thy uncreating word;</p>
<p>Thy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall,</p>
<p>And universal darkness buries all. 51</p>
<p>Perhaps he mistook his own decomposition for the collapse of the cos-
mos. At the age of fifty-five he was already dying of old age. Dropsy
made it difficult for him to walk, asthma made it painful for him to
breathe. On May 6, 1744, he fell into delirium, from which he emerged at
intervals; in one of these he expressed his confidence in life after
death. A Catholic friend asked if he should call a priest; Pope
answered, “I do not think it essential, but it will be very right, and I
thank you for putting me in mind of it.” 52 He died on May 30, “so
placidly” (if we may believe Johnson) “that the attendants did not
discern the exact time of his expiration.” As a Catholic, he was
ineligible for burial in Westminster Abbey; he was in- terred beside his
father and mother in Twickenham.</p>
<p>Was he a gentleman? No; his vituperative hatreds shared in poisoning
the literary air of England in the first half of the eighteenth century;
his</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>I 77</p>
<p>physical sufferings produced acrid acids, and deprived him of the
strength that overflows in charity. Was he a genius? Of course: not in
thought, which he borrowed, but in form, which he perfected in his
genre. Thack- eray called him “the greatest literary artist that the
world has seen.” 53 In felicity of speech, compression of expression,
fertility of phrase, he was the paragon of his time. Even the French
accepted him as the greatest poet of his generation; Voltaire looked up
to him and imitated him, as in the Dis- cours sur Vhomrne. For thirty
years — longer than any other poet — he was the sovereign of English
verse, and for thirty more he was the model of English bards till
Wordsworth announced another age.</p>
<p>For us today, hurried with all our leisure, Pope’s couplets,
mechanically sliced, or rising and falling “like a seesaw,” 54 possess a
virtus dormitiva, periodically arousing us with epigrams. Even the
brilliant Essay on Man is poetry only in its feet and rhymes. Its
workmanship is too visible; the artist has forgotten Horace’s counsel to
hide his art. He forgot, too, Hor- ace’s warning that the poet must
himself have feeling before he can convey it; Pope felt, but mostly to
scorn and revile. He lacked the sense of beauty for noble actions or
feminine grace. His imagination was exhausted in find- ing correct,
incisive, concentrated words for old ideas; it did not reach out to
grasp the ideal forms that inspire great poets and philosophers. Only
his hatreds gave him wings.</p>
<p>He remains the chief poetic symbol of England’s “Augustan Age”— whose
bounds might be defined by his life, 1688-1744. The growing familiarity
of the British mind with the classics of Greece and Rome, and with the
French drama of the grand siecle; the influence of aristocracy — of
class dominating mass — in speech, manners, polite vocabulary, and
gracious ease; the reaction of reason and realism after Elizabethan
extravagance and Puri- tan converse with God; the passage of French
norms to England with the Restoration; the new prestige of science and
philosophy: all these collabo- rated to bring the prevalent forms of
English poetry under the classic rules of Horace and Boileau. An age of
criticism succeeded an age of imagina- tion; whereas in Elizabethan
England poetry invaded and colored prose, now in Augustan England prose
degraded and discolored poetry. The im- press of this “neoclassic”
literature on the English language was good and bad: it gave it a new
precision, clarity, and elegance; it forfeited the vital- ity, force,
and warmth of Elizabethan speech. The old ebullience and in- dividualism
of character and expression yielded to a superimposed order that
compelled conformity in life and form in literature. Youth became middle
age.</p>
<p>This neoclassical style spoke for only a part of English life; it had
no</p>
<p>r oom for rebellion, sentiment, or idealizing love. Even during
Pope’s pon - tificate there were British poets who cried out against
artificiality and logic,</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>turned from reason to nature, and found a voice for feeling, wonder,
im- agination, brooding melancholy and grieving hope. At the peak of
Eng- land’s classic age the Romantic movement began.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE VOICES OF FEELING</li>
</ol>
<p>Neoclassic poetry contemplated hardly anything but the world of
print. It saw Homer and Horace, Addison and Pope, more vividly than the
men and women who passed in the streets, or the weather and landscapes
that entered daily into human moods. But now literature again discovered
what philosophers had so long argued, that man is a general and abstract
notion; that only men exist, fondly individual and jealously real. Poets
deepened themselves by touching the earth, by feeling and responding to
fields, hills, sea, and sky, and by reaching down beneath ideas to the
secret sentiments that speech less manifested than concealed. They
shrugged off discourse, and resolved to sing; the lyric returned, the
epic died away. The longing for supernatural comfort, for some mystic
wonder enlarging life, survived the deistic attack on miracles, and
sought increasingly, in medieval myths, Oriental romances, and Gothic
forms, some escape from the harsh realities of this nether world.</p>
<p>Of course there had always been voices of feeling. Had not
Steele’s</p>
<p>Christian Hero (1701) lauded old faith and kindly sentiment? Had not
Shaftesbury’s Characteristics ( 1 7 1 1 ) centered human life on
“passion” and “affection”? Would not the skeptic Hu me and the economist
Smith derive all morality from fellow feeling, sympathy? Nevertheless it
was James Thomson who struck the first clear blow for “sensibility.”</p>
<p>He was the son of a poor parson in the hills of Scotland. He went
down to Edinburgh to study for the ministry, but was deterred by
professorial condemnation of his diction as profanely poetical. He
migrated to London, was robbed en route, approached starvation, and sold
his poem Winter (1726) to buy a pair of shoes. 55 However, its
dedication to Sir Spencer Compton brought him twenty guineas for his
compliments; the English nobles were not as deaf or tight as Johnson
thought. Thomson recalled the crunch of boots in the crust of snow, and
how he had</p>
<p>Heard the winds roar and the deep torrent burst,</p>
<p>Or seen the deep-fermenting tempest brewed</p>
<p>In the grim evening sky;</p>
<p>how he had watched from the shore the winds plow up the sea, turning
“from its bottom the discolored deep,” tearing ships from their
anchorage,</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>l 19</p>
<p>lifting them precariously upon one wave, pressing them down ominously
beneath the next, flinging them upon “sharp rock or shoal insidious,”
and scattering them “in loose fragments . . . floating round.” He
pictured the peasant caught in a blizzard of blinding snow, sinking icy
feet into deeper drifts as he struggles on, until he can lift his boots
no more, and falls ex- hausted into a frozen death.</p>
<p>Ah, little think the gay, licentious proud . . .</p>
<p>How many feel, this very moment, death</p>
<p>And all the sad variety of pain; . . .</p>
<p>How many pine in want, and dungeon glooms,</p>
<p>Shut from the common air and common use</p>
<p>Of their own limbs; how many drink the cup</p>
<p>Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread</p>
<p>Of misery, sore pierced by wintry winds;</p>
<p>How many shrink into the sordid hut</p>
<p>Of cheerless poverty. . . .</p>
<p>Here was a new note of pity to shame Pall Mall and Downing Street,
and a refreshing return to Milton’s blank verse after what Thomson
called the “little glittering prettiness” of Pope’s rhymes.</p>
<p>Another year and patron saw Thomson’s Summer through the press
(1727), and in that year he joined, with a famous poem, in the cry for
war with Spain:</p>
<p>When Britain first at Heaven’s command</p>
<p>Arose from out the azure main,</p>
<p>This was the charter of her land,</p>
<p>And guardian angels sung this strain:</p>
<p>Rule, Britannia, rule the waves;</p>
<p>Britons never will be slaves.</p>
<p>From London he wandered for days and weeks into the countryside,
absorbing with a poet’s doubled senses “each rural sight, each rural
sound”; loving the “smell of dairy” coming from the farms, thrilled by
the sun triumphing after rain, or anticipating Keats’s autumnal
melancholy mood. So he published Spring in 1728, and, adding Autumn
(“the envenomed leaf begins to curl”), united all four poems in The
Seasons (1730). He was re - warded with a tour of the Continent as
companion to Charles Talbot, son of the current Chancellor. Returning,
he lived in ease and wrote poor poetry till the Chancellor died (1737).
After another stay with poverty he was introduced to the Prince of
Wales, who asked him about the state of his affairs; Thomson replied
“that they were in a more poetical posture than formerly,” and received
a pen sion of a hundred pounds for his quip. Sud-</p>
<p>i8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>denly a cold caught on the Thames ended his life at the age of
forty-eight.</p>
<p>The Seasons set a style in the minor verse of England, and found
follow- ers in France; there Jean Frangois de Saint-Lambert, who stole
fimilie from Voltaire, composed Les Saisons (1769). While heroic
couplets strutted across the century, Edward Young, William Collins,
William Shenstone, Mark Akenside, and Thomas Gray widened the Romantic
road to Words- worth and Chatterton. Young, after writing gay nothings
till sixty, feath- ered his celestial nest with Night Thoughts on Life,
Death, and Immor- tality (1742- 44). Voltaire dismissed this nocturnal
emission as “a confused mixture of bom bast and obscure trivialities”;
but perhaps that was because Young had pricked him with an epigram:</p>
<p>You are so witty, profligate, and thin,</p>
<p>At once we think you Milton, Death, and sin. 56</p>
<p>William Collins lived half as long as Young, and wrote twice as
little and as well. Evading a call to the ministry, he spent his last
pennies polishing to perfection the fifteen hundred lines he composed
before he went mad and died (1759), aged thirty-e ight. Finer than his
lauded “Ode to Evening” is his epitaph for the British soldiers who had
fallen in battle in 1745:</p>
<p>How sleep the brave who sink to rest</p>
<p>By all their country’s wishes blest!</p>
<p>When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,</p>
<p>Returns to deck th eir hallow’d mold,</p>
<p>She there shall dress a sweeter sod</p>
<p>Than Fancy’s feet have ever trod.</p>
<p>By fairy hands their knell is rung,</p>
<p>By forms unseen their dirge is sung;</p>
<p>There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,</p>
<p>To bless the turf that wraps their clay;</p>
<p>And Freedom shall awhile repair</p>
<p>To dwell a weeping hermit there.</p>
<p>Most memorable among these poets of sensibility was the strange
spirit who gave our youthful melancholy many a tender phrase. Thomas
Gray was one of twelve children born to a London scrivener; eleven of
them died in infancy; Thomas survived that dangerous age only because
his mother, seeing him in convulsions, used her scissors to open his
vein. At eleven he went to Eton, where he began fateful friendships with
Horace Walpole and Rich ard West. Then to Cambridge, which he found
“full of doleful creatures” and dreary dons. He proposed to study law,
but slipped into entomology and poetry; eventually he became so learned
in languages, sci- ences, and history that his verse was stifled with
scholarship.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) LITERATURE AND THE STAGE 1 8 1</p>
<p>In 1739 he toured the Continent with Horace Walpole. Crossing the</p>
<p>Alps in winter, he reported that “not a precipice, not a torrent, not
a cliff but is pregnant with religion and poetry”; in 1 740, writing
from Rome, he introduced the word picturesque into the English language;
even in 1755 Johnson’s Dictionary knew it not. In Reggio Emilia he and
Walpole quar - reled; Horace had been too conscious of his pedigree,
Thomas too proud of his pov erty; a “mutual friend” betrayed to each of
them the other’s pri - vate opinion; they parted, and Gray went on alone
to Venice, Grenoble, and London.</p>
<p>The death of his friend West (1742) at the age of twenty-six made him
resent life. He retired to the home of an uncle at Stoke Poges; there,
amid his continued studies, he wrote (1742) his “Ode on a Distant
Prospect of Eton College.” Looking from a safe remove upon those
scholastic scenes, he thought of his friend so prematurely dead; and
beyond the sports and gaiety of those youths he saw with morose vision
their troubled destinies:</p>
<p>These shall the fury Passions tear.</p>
<p>The vultures of the mind,</p>
<p>Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,</p>
<p>And Shame that skulks behind;</p>
<p>Or pining Love shall waste their youth.</p>
<p>Or Jealousy with rankling tooth</p>
<p>That inly gnaws the secret heart.</p>
<p>And Envy wan, and faded Care,</p>
<p>Grim-visaged comfortless Despair,</p>
<p>And Sorrow’s piercing dart. . . .</p>
<p>Lo! in the vale of years beneath,</p>
<p>A grisly troop are seen,</p>
<p>The painful family of Death,</p>
<p>More hideous than their Queen.</p>
<p>This racks the joints, this fires the veins,</p>
<p>That every laboring sinew strains,</p>
<p>Those in the deeper vitals rage;</p>
<p>Lo, Poverty, to fill the band,</p>
<p>That numbs the soul with icy hand,</p>
<p>And slow-consuming Age.</p>
<p>To each his sufferings; all are men,</p>
<p>Condemned alike to groan,</p>
<p>The tender for another’s pain,</p>
<p>The unfeeling for his own.</p>
<p>Vet ah! why should they know their fate.</p>
<p>Since sorrow never comes too late,</p>
<p>And happiness too swiftly flies?</p>

<p>Thought would destroy their paradise.</p>
<p>No more; where ignorance is bliss</p>
<p>’Tis folly to be wise.</p>
<p>Late in 1742 Gray returned to Cambridge to resume his studies. To
Wal- pole, reconciled, he sent (1750) his “Elegy Written in a Country
Church - yard.” Walpole gave it some private circulation; a pirate
publisher printed and garbled it; to protect his verse Gray let Dodsley
issue a better, though still imperfect, version (1751). In this, one of
the finest poems of the cen- tury, Gray clothed a romantic melancholy in
chiseled classical form, re- placing Pope’s “clanging couplets” with
quiet quatrains moving in melo - dious dignity to their somber end.</p>
<p>In 1753 his mother died; he wrote a tender epitaph, and buried
himself in poetry. In an ode on “The Progress of Poesy” he hailed the
passage of the Muses from Greece and Rome to “Albion”; he confessed his
boyhood asp iration to rival Pindar, and begged of Poetry the gift of an
“uncon - querable mind.” A still loftier ode, “The Bard,” saw in the
poets a redeem - ing feature of British life, exposing vice and tyranny.
These two Pindaric Odes, published by Walpole’s pres s at Strawberry
Hill, were so artificial in form, so recondite in classical and medieval
allusions, that only scholars could understand them. Gray wrapped his
solitude in pride. “I would not have put another 〔explanatory〕 note to
save the souls of all the owls in London. It is extremely well as it is
— nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied.” 57 The owls were
familiar with such whistling in the</p>
<p>Morose in his room at Peterhouse, Cambridge, too poor and timid to
marry, too sensitive for the scuffle of life, Gray became a melancholy
intro- vert. Some undergraduates, resenting his distance and dignity,
and knowing his fear of fire, startled him one night by shouting, under
his window, that the hall was aflame. In his nightshirt, says a disputed
story, he let himself out of the window and slid down a rope — into a
tub of water placed by the pranksters to receive him. 58 In 1769 he
toured the English lakes; in the Journal that he wrote (in a remarkably
beautiful hand) he first made Eng- land realize the loveliness of that
region. On another tour, at Malvern, he received a copy of The Deserted
Village ; “this man,” he exclaimed, “is a poet.” Then gout ended his
travels, and soon afterward his life (1771).</p>
<p>For a time his reputation was extreme. By common consent, in 1757, he
stood at the head of English poets; he was offered the laureateship, but
de- clined. Cowper, passing over Milton, called Gray “the only poet
since Shakespeare entitled to the characte r of sublime.” Adam Smith,
passing over Shakespeare, added: “Gray joins to the sublimity of Milton
the ele - gance and harmony of Pope; and nothing is wanting to render
him, per- haps, the first poet in the English language, but to have
written a little</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>more.” 59 Johnson admired the “Elegy,” but was learned enough to find
a score of flaws in the odes; “Gray has a kind of strutting dignity, and
is tall by walking on tiptoe. … I confess that I contemplate his poetry
with less satisfaction than his life.” 60</p>
<p>We might justly invert that oracle. Gray’s was an unhappy, unprepos -
sessing life, from the quarrel with Walpole to the tale of a tub. Its
noblest events were three or four poems that will remain for yet many
generations among the most convincing arguments for the “progress of
poesy” from Greece to Rome to Albion.</p>

<li>THE STAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>What were the London theaters doing in this half century? They were
chiefly the Drury Lane and (from 1733) the Covent Garden; there were
minor stages in Lincoln’s Inn Fields and Goodman’s Fields; the Haymarket
had a Little Theatre for comedies, and His Majesty’s Theatre for opera;
altogether London had twice as many theaters as Paris. Performances
began at 6 p.m. The audience had changed its character since Restoration
days; “society” now withdrew from the theater to the opera. Favored
or</p>
<p>moneyed auditors still sat on the stage. The “pit” and galleries
seated almost two thousand persons; there the middle class predominated,
and determined by its applause the reception and quality of the plays;
hence the rising com- petition of bourgeois with romantic themes. Women
took all female parts, and many male hearts; now began the reign of
famous actresses like Kitty Clive and Peg Woffington — whom Hogarth
painted and Charles Reade novelized.</p>
<p>As the “first, great, ruling passion of actors,” said Garrick, “is to
eat,” 81 they preferred plays spiced with sex. Said Fielding ’s Parson
Adams, “I never heard of any plays fit for a Christian to read but
Addison’s, and 〔Steele’s〕 The Conscious Lovers however, Fielding
himself produced</p>
<p>bawdy comedies. 62 Voltaire described the theaters in England as
“without decency.” Sir John Barnard appealed to the House of Commons in
1735 for some check on the theaters, alleging that “the British nation .
. . were</p>

<p>184</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>In the Encyclopedic Diderot went out of his way to praise a play, The
London Merchant, produced in London in 1 7 3 1 . It interested Diderot
be- cause it marked the introduction of middle-class tragedy to the
British stage. The French classic drama had established the principle
that tragedy belonged to the aristocracy, and would lose caste and
dignity if it de- scended to bourgeois scenes. George Lillo took a
double risk: he brought tragic drama down to a tradesman’s home, and he
wrote in prose. Thorow - good, the honest merchant, upholds “the dignity
of our profession,” and trusts that “as the name of merchant never
degrades the gentleman, so by no means does it exclude him.” The plot is
the ruin of a merchant’s ap - prentice by a seductive courtesan; the
theme is embroidered with moral exhortations, and is swathed in
sentiment. It was applauded by a middle class glad to see its virtues
and ideals presented on a British stage. Diderot welcomed and imitated
it in his campaign to introduce tragedie domestique et bourgeoise to the
French theater; Lessing adopted its tone in Miss Sara Sampson (1755).
The middle classes were asserting themselves in literature as in
politics.</p>
<p>In Scotland the dramatic pot was set to boiling by John Home, who</p>
<p>offended his fellow clergymen by writing and producing (1756)
Douglas, the most suc cessful tragic drama of its time. John’s cousin,
David Hume, in a burst of enthusiasm hardly becoming a skeptic
philosopher, hailed him as “a true disciple of Sophocles and Racine,”
who might “in time vindicate the English stage from the reproach of bar
barism.” 64 When Garrick re - fused the play Hume, Lord Karnes (Henry
Home), and the “Moderates” among the Scottish clergy arranged for its
production in Edinburgh, and David acted as ticket seller. The event was
a triumph for all Homes and Humes, and for the rest of Scotland, for
Home had transformed an old Scottish ballad into a patriotic drama that
brought tears of joy to Scottish eyes. We must except the Edinburgh
Presbytery of the Kirk, which de- nounced Home as a disgrace to his
cloth, and remin ded him of “the opinion which the Christian Church has
always entertained of stage plays and players as prejudicial to the
interest of religion and morality.” 65 Formal accusations were issued
against Home and another minister, Alexander Carlyle, for attending the
performance. David Hume, aflame with kinship, dedicated his Four
Dissertations to his cousin, and wrote a hot indictment of intolerance.
John resigned from the ministry, went to London, and saw his Douglas
produced with Peg Woffington in the female lead ( 1757 ). There too it
was a triumph; the Scots in London gathered to applaud it; and at the
close of this London premiere a Scot called down from the gal- lery,
“Ou, fie, lads, fot 〔what〕 think ye o’ yir Willy Shakespeare now?” 66
The play, as dead today as Addison’s Cato, kept the stage on and off for
a generation. When Mrs. Siddons played it in Edinburgh in 1784, the
Gen-</p>
<p>CHAP. V) LITERATURE AND THE STAGE 1 85</p>
<p>eral Assembly of the Kirk “was obliged to fix all its im portant
business for the alternate days when she did not act.” 67</p>
<p>The most hilarious success of the London stage in this period was The
Beggar’s Opera. John Gay began as a merchant’s apprentice, rose to be
secretary to the Earl of Clarendon, and became one of the liveliest mem-
bers of the Scriblerus Club. Pope described him as</p>
<p>Of manners gentle, of affections mild;</p>
<p>In wit a man; simplicity, a child;</p>
<p>With native humor temp’ring virtuous rage,</p>
<p>Form’d to delight at once and lash the age. 68</p>
<p>Gay made his mark in 1716 with Trivia, or The Art of Walking the
Streets of London. The clatter of wagon wheels on paving stones, the
drivers urg- ing their horses with whip and tongue, the “draggled
damsel” bearing fish for Billingsgate, the serenity o f “Pell Mell” with
fragrant ladies leaning on the arms of beaux, the pedestrian weaving his
way through a game of foot- ball filling the street, the gentle thieves
who with “unfelt fingers make thy</p>
<ol start="1716" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In 1720 Gay’s Poems were published by subscription, and brought him a
thousand pounds; these he lost in the crash of the South Sea Company.
Pope and others came to his aid, but in 1728 he lifted himself to
renewed prosperity with The Beggar’s Opera. The introduction presents
the beggar, who presents his opera. This begins with a ballad sung by
Peachum, who (like Jonathan Wild) pretends to serve the law by reporting
thieves (when they refuse to serve him), but actually is a dealer in
stolen goods. He calls himself an honest man because “all professions be
- rogue one another,” an d are moved by the greed for gain. His affairs
are muddled by the fact that his daughter Polly has fallen in love with,
perhaps has married, the dashing, handsome highwayman Captain Macheath;
this will interfere with the use of Polly’s charms in managi ng buyers,
sellers, and constables. Mrs. Peachum reassures him:</p>
<p>Why must our Polly, forsooth, differ from her sex, and love only her
husband, and why must our Polly’s marriage, contrary to all observa -
tion, make her the less followed by other men? All men are thieves</p>
<p>in love, and like a woman the better for being another’s property.
69</p>
<p>However, Mrs. Peachum warns her daughter:</p>
<p>You know, Polly, I am not against your toying a trifle with a
cus-</p>
<p>tomer in the way of business, or to get out a secret or so; but if I
find</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>1 86</p>
<p>that you have played the fool, and are married, you jade you, I’ll
cut your throat.</p>
<p>Polly excuses her marriage in a ballad:</p>
<p>Can love be controlled by advice?</p>
<p>Will Cupid our mothers obey?</p>
<p>Though my heart were as frozen as ice,</p>
<p>At his flame ’twould have melted away.</p>
<p>When he kissed me, so closely he pressed,</p>
<p>’Twas so sweet that I must have complied;</p>
<p>So I thought it both safest and best</p>
<p>To marry, for fear you should chide . 70</p>
<p>Peachum rages; he is afraid that Macheath will kill him and his wife
to in- herit their fortune through Polly. He schemes to betray Macheath
to the law and have him safely hanged. Macheath comes on the scene,
comforts Polly with pressures, and assures her that henceforth he will
be monoga- mous:</p>
<p>My heart was so free</p>
<p>It roved like the bee,</p>
<p>Till Polly my passion requited;</p>
<p>I sipped each flower,</p>
<p>I changed every hour,</p>
<p>But here every flower is united.</p>
<p>She begs him to swear that if transported he will take her with him.
He swears: “Is there any power . . . that could tear me from thee? You
might sooner tear a pension from a courtier, a fee from a lawyer, a
pretty woman from a looking glass.” And they join in a charming
duet:</p>
<p>he. Were I laid on Greenland’s coast,</p>
<p>And in my arms embraced my lass,</p>
<p>Warm amidst eternal frost,</p>
<p>Too soon the half- year’s night would pass.</p>
<p>she. Were I sold on Indian soil,</p>
<p>Soon as the burning day was closed,</p>
<p>I could mock the sultry toil</p>
<p>When on my charmer’s breast reposed.</p>
<p>he. And I would love you all the day,</p>
<p>she. Every night would kiss and play,</p>
<p>he. If wit h me you’d fondly stray,</p>
<p>she. Over the bills and far away.</p>

<p>She confides to him that her father plans to surrender him to the
law, and sorrowfully she bids him hide for a while. He goes, but stops
in a tavern to give his aides instructions for a robbery. When they are
gone he dances and toys with the tavern tarts; Peachum has bribed them
to betray him; while they fondle him they steal his pistols, then summon
the constables; in the next scene he is in Newgate jail. There Polly and
another of his wives contend for his person; they free him, but he is
recaptured and is sent to the gallows. En route he comforts his ladies
with a song:</p>
<p>Then farewell, my love -dear charmers, adieu!</p>
<p>Contented I die — ’tis the better for you.</p>
<p>Here ends all dispute for the rest of our lives,</p>
<p>For this way, at once, I please all my wives. 71</p>
<p>The beggar-author now appears, and prides himself on having made vice
meet its due punishment, as in all proper plays. But an actor protests
that “an opera must end happily” (how customs change!). The beggar
yields, saves Macheath from one noose and gives him Polly as another;
all dance around the couple, while the captain wonders has he met a fate
worse than death.</p>
<p>Gay had had the luck to secure the services of Johann Pepusch, a
German composer resident in England; Pepusch chose the music for Gay’s
ballads from old English airs; the result was irresistible. Despite the
satire of corrup- tion and hypocrisy, the audience at the premiere in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre (January 29, 1728) responded
enthusiastically. The play ran for sixty-three consecutive nights,
exceeding all precedents; it had long runs in the major towns of
Britain; it still holds the stage on two continents, and has been made
into one of the most delightful motion pictures of our time. The actress
who played Polly became the toast of gay blades and the favor- ite of
salons; her biography and her picture were sold in great number; her
songs were painted on fans; she married a duke. But a High Churchman
denounced Gay for making a highwayman his hero and letting him go un-
punished. When Gay tried to produce a continuation under the title Polly
the Lord Chamberlain refused to license it. Gay had Polly published; it
sold so well, and the proceeds from The Beggar’s Opera mounted so pleas-
antly, that (as a wit said) the play made Gay rich, and Rich, the
manager, gay. Four years after his triumph colic carried the poet
away.</p>
<p>V. THE NOVEL</p>
<p>The outstanding event in the literary history of this period was the
rise of the modern novel. Clarissa and Tom Jones are more important
histori-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>1 88</p>
<p>cally than any English poem or play of the age. From 1740, as the
scope of significant life broadened from the court to the people, and
from actions to sentiments, the novel replaced the drama as the voice
and mirror of England.</p>
<p>Stories were as old as writing. India had had her tales and fables;
Judea had included in her literature such legends as those of Ruth,
Esther, and Job; Hellenistic Greece and medieval Christendom had
produced romances of adventure and love; Renaissance Italy had turned
out thousands of novelle (“little novelties”), as in Boccaccio and
Bandello; Renaissance Spain</p>
<p>But were these productions novels in our present sense? They
resembled eighteenth-century fiction in being imaginary narratives; some
had the sub- stance of indubitable length; some portrayed character with
an effort at reality; but (perhaps excepting Crusoe) they lacked a plot
that would unify events and characters in a developing whole. Mrs. Aphra
Behn’s Oroonoko (1688), the story of an African slave, had a unifying
plot; so did Defoe’s Captain Singleton (1720), Moll Flanders (1722), and
Roxana (1724); but all these were still a string of episodes rather than
a structural unity in which every part advances a unifying theme. When
Richardson and Field- ing seized this art of development, portrayed
character growing through events, and made their novels picture the
manners of an age, the modern novel was born.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Samuel Richardson: 1689-1161</li>
</ol>
<p>The man who inaugurated the new novel was the son of a Derbyshire
carpenter who moved to London soon after Samuel’s birth. The family
hoped to make him a clergyman, but was too poor to give him the
requisite schooling; he managed, however, to do some preaching in his
books. The circle in which he grew retained the Puritan morality. He was
apprenticed to a printer, and his reputation for calligraphy enabled him
to add to his income by composing letters for illiterate lovesick girls;
this accident de- termined the epistolary form of his novels, and their
extensive exploration of feminine psychology and sentiment. His industry
and thrift served him well; he set up his own printing shop, married his
ex- master’s daughter (1721), and begot by her six children, of whom
five died in infancy. She too died (1730), still young and loved, and
these bereavements helped to</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>form his rather somber mood. He married again, begot six more
children, suffered more bereavements, and rose to be printer to the
House of Com- mons. He was fifty years old before he published a
book.</p>
<p>In 1739 two printer friends engaged him to write a little volume of
sam- ple letters as a guide for “those country readers who were unable
to indite for themselves,” and also as instruction in “how to think and
act justly and prudently in the common concerns of human life.” 72 While
preparing this book — and here genius took hold of circumstance —
Richardson conceived the idea of weaving a succession of letters into a
love story that would illustrate a virgin’s wise morality. The theme,
chastity preserved through</p>
<p>The first half of the story is still interesting, for we are never
too old to be interested in seduction — though after a thousand pages
even seduction becomes a bore. The stress on sentiment begins on the
first page, where Pamela writes: “Oh, how my eyes run! Don’t wonder to
see the paper so blotted.” She is a model of goodness, gentleness, and
modesty. Sent out to “service” at sixteen, she remits to her parents the
first money she earns, “for Providence will not let me want. … If I get
more I am sure it is</p>
<p>my duty, as it shall be my care, to love and cherish you both; for
you have loved and cherished me when I could do nothing for myself.” 73
The cau- tious parents refuse to use the money until they have assurance
that it is not her bachelor employer’s advance payment for Pamela’s
favors. They warn her that her beauty imperils her continence. “We fear—
yes, my dear child, we fear —  lest〕 you should be too grateful, and
reward him with that jewel, your virtue, which no riches . . . can make
up to you.” She prom - ises to be chary, and adds: “Oh, how amiable a
thing is doing good! It is all I envy great folks for.” Her sentiments
are admirable , though they lose some charm by being professed. In a
culminating catastrophe her employer enters her bed without the proper
preliminaries, and clasps her to his agi- tated bosom. She faints, and
his program is disturbed. Recovering con- sciousness, “I put my hand to
his mouth, and said, ‘Oh, tell me, yet tell me not, what have I suffered
in this distress?’” 74 He assures her that his inten - tions had
miscarried. Appreciating the compliment of his desire, she gradu- ally
learns to love him; and the gradations by which her fear is shown
turn-</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>ing to love are among the many subtle touches that support
Richardson’s reputation as a psychologist. Nevertheless she resists all
his sieges, and fi- nally he breaks down and offers her marriage. Happy
to have saved her virtue and his soul, Pamela resolves to be a perfect
English wife: to stay at home, avoid grand parties, keep the household
accounts carefully, distrib- ute charity, make jellies, cookies,
candies, and preserves, and be grateful if her husband, descending the
ladder of class, will give her now and then the grace and benefit of his
conversation. Richardson concludes Volume II with a homily on the
advantages of virtue in the bargaining of the sexes. “The editor of
these sheets will have his end if it 〔Pamela’s virtue〕 inspires a
laudable emulation in the minds of any worthy persons, who may thereby
entitle themselves to the rewards, the praises, and the blessings by
which Pamela wa s so deservedly distinguished.”</p>
<p>Some Englishmen, like the lusty Fielding, laughed, but thousands
of</p>
<p>middle- class readers entered sympathetically into Pamela’s throbs.
The clergy praised the book, glad to have found such reinforcements of
their sermons in a literature that had seemed sold to Beelzebub. Four
editions of Pamela were taken up in six months; naturally the publishers
urged Rich- ardson to dig further in the same rich vein. But he was not
mercenary, and besides, his health had begun to fail. He took his time,
and proceeded with his printing. It was not till 1747 that he sent forth
the masterpiece that brought all bourgeois Europe to his feet.</p>
<p>Clarissa, or The History of a Young Lady, two thousand pages
long,</p>
<p>came out in seven volumes between November, 1747, and December, 1748.
Hurt by the charge that Pamela had shown virtue as merely a bargaining
strategy, and had pictured a reformed rake as a good husband, Richardson
undertook to show virtue as a divine gift to be rewarded in heaven, and
an unreformed rake as inevitably bound for an evil and shattering end.
The impetuous Lovelace, reputed a devil with women, seeks the hand of
Clarissa Harlowe. She distrusts him, but is insensibly fascinated by his
reputation. Her family forbids her to meet such a scoundrel; it closes
its doors to him, and offers her Mr. Solmes, a man of no vices and no
character. She refuses. To make her yield they scold her, torment her,
lock her up. Lovelace hires an aide to simulate an armed attack upon her
by her relatives; to escape them she allows him to abduct her to
St. Albans. She is willing to marry him, but he thinks this too
desperate a venture. He writes to a friend:</p>
<p>. . . Determined to marry I would be, were it not for this
considera-</p>
<p>tion, that once married, I am married for life.</p>
<p>That’s the plague of it! Could a man do as the birds do, change</p>
<ul>
<li>mates〕 every Valentine’s Day, . . . there would be nothing at all
in</li>
</ul>
<p>it. . . . Such a change would be a means of annihilating . . . four
or</p>
<p>five very atrocious capital sins: rape, vulgarly so called, adultery,
and</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>l 9 l</p>
<p>fornication; nor would polygamy be panted after. Frequently it would
prevent murders and dueling; hardly any such thing as jealousy (the
causes of shocking violences) would be heard of. . . . Nor would there
possibly be such a person as a barren woman. . . . Both sexes would bear
with each other, in the view that they could help themselves in a few
months. . . . The newspapers would be crowded with paragraphs . . .
concerned to see who and who’s together . Then would not the dis-
tinction be very pretty, Jack? as in flowers: such a gentleman, or such
a lady, is an annual , such a one is a perennial , 75</p>
<p>He tries to seduce Clarissa; she warns him that if he touches her she
will kill herself. He keeps her in durance vile but genteel, during
which she sends heartbroken letters to her confidante, Anna Howe. He
invents one scheme after another to break through her defenses; she
resists him, yet considers her honor irrevocably tarnished by her
half-consenting to elope. She writes pitiful letters to her father
begging him, not to forgive her, but to withdraw the curse which he has
laid upon her, and which, she thinks, forever closes to her the gates of
Paradise; he refuses. She falls into a wast- ing illness, in which her
only support is her religious faith. Lovelace dis- appears into France,
and is killed in a duel by Clarissa’s uncle. At last her parents come
offering forgiveness, and find her dead.</p>
<p>It is a simple story, too long drawn out on a single note to hold the
atten- tion of our hectic minds; but in eighteenth-century England it
became a national issue; hundreds of readers, in the intervals of
publication, wrote to Richardson imploring him not to let Clarissa die .
76 One father described his three daughters as having “at this moment
each a separate volume 〔 of Clarissa 〕 in her hand; and all their eyes
like a wet flower in April .” 77 Lady</p>
<p>I was such an old fool as to weep over Clarissa Harlowe, like any</p>
<p>milkmaid of sixteen over the ballad of the Lady’s Fall. To say truth,
the first volumes softened me by a near resemblance of my maiden days;
but on the whole it is miserable stuff. . . . Clarissa follows the maxim
of declaring all she thinks to all the people she sees, without
reflecting that, in this mortal state of imperfection, fig leaves are as
necessary for our minds as our bodies, and ’tis as indecent t o show all
we think as all we have . 78</p>
<p>The women of England now importuned the triumphant Richardson to

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>goaded on by Fielding’s satire of Famela in Joseph Andrews, and
Fielding’s full-length portrait of a man in Tom Jones. So, between
November, 1753, and March, 1 754, he sent forth in seven volumes The
History of Sir Charles Grandison. The blase mood of our time finds it
hard to understand why this third novel had as great a success as the
other two; the twentieth-cen- tury reaction against Puritanism and the
Mid-Victorian compromise has closed our hearts to pictures of ideal
goodness, at least in the male; we have found good men, but none without
redeeming faults. Richardson tried to embellish Sir Charles with some
minor shortcomings, but we still resent the impassable distance between
him and ourselves. Moreover, virtue loses charm when it is put on
parade. Grandison barely escaped canonization.</p>
<p>Richardson was so intent on preaching that he allowed some flaws into
his literary art. He was almost devoid of humor and wit. His attempt to
tell a long story through letters involved him in many improbabilities
(remem- bering such reams of conversation) ; but it allowed him to
present the same events from a variety of views, and it gave the
narrative an intimacy hardly possible in a less subjective form. It was
quite in the custom of the time to write long and confiding letters to
trusted relatives or friends. Furthermore, the epistolary method gave
scope to Richardson’s forte— the display of feminine character. There
are faults here too: he knew men less than women, nobles less than
commoners; and he seldom caught the variations, contradictions, and
development in the soul. But a thousand details show his careful
observation of human conduct. In these novels English psycho- logical
fiction was born, and the subjectivism that came to a fever in
Rousseau.</p>
<p>Richardson took his success modestly. He continued his work as a</p>
<p>printer, but he built himself a better home. He wrote long letters of
advice to a wide circle of women, some of whom called him “dear Papa.”
In his later years he paid with nervous sensitivity and insomnia the
price of con- centrated thought and diffuse art. On July 4, 1761, he
died of a paralytic stroke.</p>
<p>His international influence was greater than that of any other
Englishman of his time except Wesley and the elder Pitt. At home he
helped to mold the moral tone of Johnson’s England, and to raise the
morals of the court</p>

<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>

<p>said, he had to sell his library, he would keep, of all his books,
only Homer, Euripides, Sophocles, and Richardson. In Germany Gellert
translated and imitated Pamela, and wept over Grandison ; 80 Klopstock
went into raptures over Clarissa; Wieland based a play on Grandison;
Germans made pilgrim- ages to Richardson’s home. 81 In Italy Goldoni
adapted Pamela to the stage.</p>
<p>No one reads Richardson today except through the compulsions of
schol- arship; we have no leisure to write such letters, much less to
read them; and the moral code of an industrial and Darwinian age flees
impatiently from Puritan cautions and restraints. But we know that these
novels represented, far more than the poetry of Thomson, Collins, and
Gray, the revolt of feeling against the worship of intellect and reason;
and we recognize in Richardson the father — as in Rousseau the
protagonist — of that Romantic movement which, toward the end of the
century, would triumph over the classical artistry of Pope and the lusty
realism of Fielding.</p>
<p>2 . Henry Fielding: 1101-54</p>
<p>When he came upon London in 1727 everyone admired his tall figure,
stalwart presence, handsome face, jolly speech, and open heart; here was
a man equipped by nature to enjoy life in all its relish and
disreputable real- ity. He had everything but money. Forced, as he put
it, to be a hackney coachman or a hackney scribe, he harnessed himself
to a pen, and buttered his bread with comedies and burlesques. His
second cousin, Lady Mary Montagu, used her influence to have his play
Love in Several Masques pro- duced at the Drury Lane Theatre (1728); she
went twice to see it, gra- ciously conspicuous; and in 1732 she helped
his Modern Husband to a good run. He persisted with one mediocre play
after another, and struck a vein of good-natured satire in The Tragedy
of Tragedies, or The Life and</p>
<p>Death of Tom T humb the Great (1731).</p>
<p>After four years’ courtship he married Charlotte Cradock (1734). Soon
she inherited £ 1,500, and Fielding retired with her to ease as a
country gentleman. He fell in love with his wife; he described her
uxoriously as the shyly beautiful Sophia Western and the infinitely
patient Amelia Booth. Lady Bute assures us that “the glowing language he
knew how to employ did no more than justice to the amiable qualities of
the original, or to her beauty.” 82</p>
<p>In 1736 he was back in London, producing unmemorable plays. But in
1737 the Licensing Act laid restrictions upon the drama, and Fielding
with- drew from the stage. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar (
1 740) . The course of his life was diverted in that year by the
appearance of Rich- ardson’s Pamela. All of Fielding’s propensity to
satire was provoked by the</p>
<p>’94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>conscious virtues of the heroine and her creator. It was as a parody
of Pamela that he began The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews
and His Friend Mr . Abraham Adams , Written in Imitation of the Manner
of Cervantes (1742). Joseph, who is introduced as Pamela’s brother, is
as pure and beautiful a youth as Pamela was a maiden. Like her he is
repeat- edly tempted by his employer, and resists; and like her he
details in his letters the insidious attempts upon his virginity. His
letter to Pamela is al- most, not quite, Richardsonian:</p>
<p>Dear Sister Pamela:</p>
<p>Hoping you are well, what news have I to tell you! . . . My
mistress</p>
<p>has fallen in love with me — that is, what great folks call falling
in love — she has a mind to ruin me; but I hope I shall have more
resolution and more grace than to part with my virtue to any lady on
earth.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams hath often told me that chastity is as great a virtue in
a</p>
<p>man as in a woman. He says he never knew any more than his wife, and
I shall endeavor to follow his example. Indeed, it is owing entirely to
his excellent sermons and advice, together with your letters, that I
have been able to resist a temptation which, he says, no man complies
with but he repents in this world and is damned for it in the next. . .
.</p>
<p>What fine things are good advice and good examples! But I am glad</p>
<p>she turned me out of the chamber as she did; for I had once
almost</p>
<p>forgotten every word Parson Adams had ever said to me.</p>
<p>I don’t doubt, dear sister, but you will have grace to preserve
your</p>
<p>virtue against all trials; and I beg you earnestly to pray I may be
en-</p>
<p>abled to preserve mine; for truly it is very severely attacked by
more than one; but I hope I shall copy your example, and that of Joseph
my namesake, and maintain my virtue against all temptation. . . . 83</p>
<p>He succeeds, and remains a virgin till he marries the virgin Fanny.
Pamela, lifted a social notch as wife of her rich employer, condemns
Fanny for presuming to marry Joseph, whose social status has been raised
by Pamela’s genteel marriage. Richardson complained that Fielding had
committed a “lewd and ungenerous engraftment” on Pamela , 84</p>
<p>Fielding’s appetite for satire was not sated by parodying Richardson;
he burlesqued the Iliad by invoking the Muses and making his book an
epic. His fount of humor bubbled over in the various characters that
Joseph and Adams meet on their way, and especially the innkeeper
Tow-wouse, who is surprised by Mrs. Tow-wouse in flagrante delicto with
Betty the cham- bermaid, is forgiven, and “quietly and contentedly bore
to be remi nded of his transgressions . . . once or twice a day during
the residue of his life.” And since it was not in Fielding’s nature to
make a hero, and a whole novel, out of an impeccable youth, he soon lost
interest in Joseph, and made Par- son Adams the central figure of his
book. This seemed an unlikely choice,</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>*95</p>
<p>for Adams was an honestly orthodox divine, who carried with him a
manu- script of his sermons in search of a reckless publisher. But his
creator en- dowed Adams with a strong pipe, a tough stomach, and a hard
pair of fists; and though the parson is against war, he is a good
fighter, and lays low a succession of scoundrels in the wake of his
tale. He is by all odds the most lovabl e character in Fielding; and we
share the author’s pleasure in putting him through strange encounters
with pigs, mud, and blood. Those of us who in youth were deeply moved by
the Christian ideal must feel a warm affection for a clergyman who is
utterly without guile and overflows with charity. Fielding contrasts him
with the moneygrubbing Parson Trulliber, who was “one of the largest men
you should see, and could have acted the part of Sir John Falstaff
without stuffing.” 85</p>
<p>Flushed with success, Fielding issued in 1743 three volumes modestly
en- titled Miscellanies. Volume III contained a masterpiece of sustained
irony in The Life of Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great. It was not a factual
biography of the famous eighteenth-centu ry Fagin; “my narrative is
rather of such actions which he might have performed.” 86 In its first
form it was a hit at Sir Robert Walpole as a dealer in stolen votes;
after Walpole’s death it was reissued as a satire of “greatness” as
usually rated and achieved. Most “great men,” Fielding held, had done
more harm than good to mankind; so Alex - ander was called “the Great”
because, after “he had with fire and sword overrun a vast empire, had
destroyed the lives of an immense number of innocent wretches, had
scattered ruin and desolation like a whirlwind, we are told, as an act
of his clemency, that he did not cut the throat of an old woman and
ravish her daughters.” 87 The thief should have an easier con - science
than the “statesman,” since his vict ims are fewer and his booty less.
88</p>
<p>In the style of a political biography Fielding gives Jonathan a lofty
an- cestral tree, tracing his lineage to “Wolfstan Wild, who came over
with Hengist.” His mother “had a most marvelous glutinous quality
attendin g her fingers.” 89 From her Jonathan learned the art and ethics
of thievery. His superior intelligence soon enabled him to organize a
gang of brave youths dedicated to separating superfluous people from
their superfluous goods or a meaningless life. He took the lion’s share
of their gains, and rid himself of disobedient subalterns by
surrendering them to the forces of law and order. He failed to seduce
the chased Laetitia, who preferred to be ruined by his assistant
Fireblood, who “in a few minutes r avished this fair creature, or at
least would have ravished her, if she had not by a timely compliance,
prevented him.” 90 Thereafter she married Wild. Two weeks later they
indulge in “a dialogue matrimonial,” wherein she explains her natural
right to promiscuity; he calls her a bitch; they kiss and make up. He
rises higher still and higher in the grandeur of his crimes, until his
wife has the satisfaction of seeing him condemned to death. A clergyman
attends</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>him to the gallows; Wild picks his pocket en route, but gets only a
cork- screw, for the dominie was a connoisseur of vintages. And
“Jonathan Wild the Great, after all his mighty exploits was — what so
few Great Men can accomplish — h anged by the neck till he was dead.”
91</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1744 Fielding lost his wife; the event darkened his
mood until he purged his grief by portraying her fondly, through the pa-
thos of distance, as Sophia and Amelia. He was so grateful for the loyal
devotion of his wife’s maid, who remained to take care of his children,
that in 1747 he married her. Meanwhile he suffered both in health and in
in- come. He was rescued by appointment (1748) as justice of the peace
for Westminster, and shortly thereafter for Middlesex. It was a
laborious office, precariously paid by the fees of the litigants who
came to his court in Bow Street. He called the aggregate three hundred
pounds a year “the dirtiest money upon earth.” 92</p>
<p>During these troubled years, 1 744-48, he must have been working on
his greatest novel, for in February, 1749, it appeared in six volumes as
The His- tory of Tom Jones, a Foundling. The book was composed, he tells
us, in “some thousands of hours” salvag ed from law and hack writing;
and no one could tell, from its robust humor and virile ethic, that
these were years of grief and gout and thinning purse. Yet here were
twelve hundred pages of what many consider the greatest English novel.
Never before in English literature had a man been so fully and frankly
described in body and mind, morals and character. Famous are the words
of Thackeray introducing Pendennis:</p>
<p>Since the author of T om Jones was buried, no writer of fiction among
us has been permitted to depict to his utmost power a Man. We</p>
<p>must drape him, and give him a certain conventional simper. Society
will not tolerate the Natural in our Art. … You will not hear . . .</p>
<p>what moves in the real world, what passes in society, in the clubs,
col- leges, mess-rooms — what is the life and talk of your sons.</p>
<p>Tom makes his debut as an illegitimate infant found in
Mr. Allworthy’s virtuous bed. Between this and Tom’s concluding marriage
Fielding</p>
<p>squeezed a hundred episodes, apparently in picaresque and unconnected
succession; but the reader is surprised, if he persists to the end, to
find that nearly all those incidents were necessary to the skillfully
woven plot, or to the exposition and development of the characters; the
threads are un- raveled, the knots are untied. Several of the personnel
are idealized, like the almost Grandisonian Allworthy; some are too
simplified, like the un- failingly despicable Blifil, or the Reverend
Mr. Thwackum, the pedagogue “whose meditations were full of birch.” 93
But many of them show the sap of life. Squire Western, of all things in
this world, “held most dear … his</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>guns, dogs and horses ,” 94 then his bottle, then his incomparable
daughter Sophia. Here is a Clarissa who knows her ways among the snares
of men, a Pamela who snares her man without ado about his premarital
experiments.</p>
<p>Tom is a little loose in the loins, but otherwise he is almost too
good to survive. Adopted by Allworthy, schooled and thrashed by
Thwackum, he grows into a sturdy manhood disturbed only by malicious
reminders of his mysterious parentage. He robs an orchard and steals a
duck, but his adop- tive father forgives these pranks as in the best
Shakespearean tradition. Sophia admires him from a chaste distance, but
Tom, conscious of his ille- gitimacy, never dares to fall in love with a
lady so remote from him in status and means. He contents himself with
A^olly Seagrim, the gamekeep- er’s daughter, and confesses himself as
possibly the father of her child; he is much relieved to find that he is
only one of several such possibilities. So- phia suffers when she learns
of this liaison, but her admiration for Tom is only transiently cooled.
He catches her in his arms as she falls from her horse while hunting;
her blushes reveal her feeling for him; and now he loses no time losing
his heart. Squire Western, however, has set his purse on marrying her to
Mr. Blifil, who is the legitimate nephew and heir of the wealthy and
childless Allworthy. Sophia refuses to marry this young hypo- crite; the
Squire insists; and the battle between father’s will and daughter’s</p>
<p>“To her, boy, to her, go to her. … Is it all over? H ath she ap-</p>
<p>pointed the day, boy? What, shall it be tomorrow or the next day? I
shan’t be put off a minute longer than the next day. . . .

<p>she’d have the wedding tonight with all her heart. Wouldst not,</p>
<p>Sophy? . . . Where the devil’s Allworthy? Harkee, Allworthy, I’ll

<p>thee five pounds to a crown we have a boy tomorrow nine months .”
95</p>
<p>Not since Shakespeare had anyone depicted English life so abundantly
or so frankly. It is not all there; we miss the tenderness, devotion,
heroism, civilities, and pathos that can be found in any society.
Fielding preferred the man of instinct to the man of thought. He scorned
the bowdlerizers</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>who in his time were trying to fumigate Chaucer and Shakespeare, and
those poets and critics who supposed that serious literature should deal
only with the upper class. He interpreted love between the sexes as
physical love, and relegated other aspects of it to the world of
delusion. He despised the money madness that he saw in every rank, and
he abominated humbug and hypocrisy. He made short shrift of preachers;
but he loved Parson Adams, and the only hero in Amelia is Dr. Harrison,
an Anglican clergyman;</p>
<p>Fielding himself preached at every opportunity.</p>
<p>After publishing Tom Jones he turned his pen for a while to the prob-
lems that he faced as a magistrate. His experience was bringing him
daily into contact with London’s violence and crime. He suggested
methods of tightening the guard of public order and the administration
of justice. Through his efforts, and those of his half brother Sir John
Fielding, who succeeded him as magistrate in Bow Street, one of the
gangs that had ter- rified London was broken up, and nearly all its
members were hanged. An optimist reported in 1757 that “the reigning
evil of street robberies has been almost wholly suppressed.” 96</p>
<p>Meanwhile (December, 1751) Henry had published his last novel,</p>
<p>Amelia. He could not forget his first wife; he had forgotten any
faults she may have had; now he raised a monument to her as the
faultless mate of an improvident soldier. Captain Booth is kind, brave,
and generous; he adores his Amelia; but he gambles himself into debt,
and the book opens with him in jail. He takes a hundred pages to tell
his story to another inmate, Miss Matthews; he expounds to her the
beauty, modesty, fidelity, tenderness, and other perfections of his
wife, and then accepts Miss Matthews’ invita - tion to share her bed. He
continues “a whole week in this criminal conver - sation.” 97 In these
and later prison scenes Fielding displays, with perhaps some
exaggeration, the hypocrisies of men and women, the venality of con-
stables and magistrates, the brutality of jailers. Here already are the
debtors’ prisons that will linger on for a century more to stir Dickens’
ire. Justice Thrasher can tell a prisoner’s guilt from his brogue.
“Sirrah, your tongue betrays your guilt. You are an Irishman, and that
is always sufficient evi- dence with me.” 98 The number of villains
rises with every chapter, until Amelia cries out to her pauperized
children, “Forgive me for bringing you into the world.” 99</p>
<p>Amelia is Fielding’s patient Griselda. She has her nose broken in an
early chapter, but rhinoplasty repairs it, and she becomes again so
beautiful that an attempt is made on her virtue in almost every
alternate chapter. She ad- mits her intellectual inferiority to her
husband. She obeys him in every- thing, except that she refuses to go to
a masquerade. She attends an oratorio by Handel, but hesitates to expose
herself to the gaze of the philanderers in Vauxhall. When Booth returns
to her after one of his escapades he finds</p>
<p>CHAP. V) LITERATURE AND THE STAGE 199</p>
<p>her “per forming the office of a cook with as much pleasure as a fine
lady generally enjoys in dressing herself for a ball.” 100 She receives
a letter from the evil Miss Matthews betraying Booth’s prison adultery;
she destroys the letter, says nothing about it to her husband, and
continues to love him through all his drinking, gambling, debts, and
imprisonments; she sells her trinkets, then her clothing, to feed him
and their children. She is discour- aged less by his faults than by the
cruelty of the men and institutions that enmesh him. Fielding, like
Rousseau and Helvetius, supposed that most men are by nature good, but
are corrupted by evil environments and bad laws. Thackeray thought
Amelia “the most charming character in English fiction”; 101 but perhaps
she was only a husband’s dream. In the end, of course, Amelia turns out
to be an heiress; she and Booth retire to her estate, and Booth becomes
a good man.</p>
<p>The conclusion is hardly justified by the premises: once a Booth
always a Booth. Fielding tried to bring all the tangles of his plot to a
happy unity, but here his sleight of hand is too obvious. The great
novelist was tired, and he was sickened by his entourage of thieves and
murderers. After complet- ing Amelia he wrote: “I will trouble the world
no more with any children of mine by the same Muse.” In January, 1752,
he started The Covent Gar - den Journal , contributed some vigorous
articles, answered Smollett’s criti - cism, took a shot at Roderick
Random, and then, in November, he let the Journal die. The winter of
1753-54 was too much for his constitution, broken down by work, dropsy,
jaundice, and asthma. He tried Bishop Berkeley’s tar water, but the
dropsy grew worse. His doctor recommended</p>
<p>What was his achievement? He established the realistic novel of man-
ners; he described the life of the English middle classes more vividly
than any historian has done; his books opened a world. He did not
succeed so well with the upper classes; there, like Richardson, he had
to be content with an outsider’s view. He knew the body of his country’s
life better than its soul, and the body of love better than its spirit;
the more delicate and subtle elements of the English character escaped
him. Even so, he left his mark upon Smollett, Sterne, Dickens, and
Thackeray; he was the father of them all.</p>
<p>3 . Tobias Smollett: 1121-11</p>
<p>Smollett did not like him, for they competed for the same applause.
The younger man was a Scot who agreed with Hume in regretting that
England</p>
<p>200 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. V</p>
<p>obstructed the way to France. His grandfather, however, had actively
pro- moted the parliamentary union with England (1707), and had been a
mem- ber of the united Parliament. His father died when Tobias was two
years old, but the family financed the boy’s education at Dumbarton
Grammar School and Glasgow University, where he took premedical courses.
Instead of completing work for his degree, he succumbed to the infection
of au- thorship, and rushed off to London and Garrick with a worthless
tragedy; Garrick refused it. Tobias, after a little starvation, signed
as surgeon’s mate</p>
<p>The Adventures of Roderick Random is the old picaresque romance of
events strung upon a character. Smollett acknowledged no debt to
Fielding, but much to Cervantes and Lesage. He was more interested in
men and deeds than in books and words; he packed his story with
incidents, gave it the stench of offal and the color of blood, and
peopled it with characters reeking with personality and lusty speech.
This is one of the first and best of a thousand English novels of the
sea. But before being dragooned into the navy Roderick, like his
creator, samples English inns and London morals. What have we not missed
by not traveling in those eighteenth- century coaches and putting up in
those inns! — such a gallery of conflicting egos, decaying soldiers,
pimps and bawds, peddlers lugging their bundles and hiding their money,
men turning over chamber pots in search of the wrong bed, women
shrieking rape and quieted with coin, every poor soul pretending
magnitude, and everyone swearing. Miss Jenny calls the peddler “you old
cent per cent fornicator!” and asks the captain, “Damn you, sir, who are
you? Who made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher-scraping, pimping
curler? ’Sdeath! the army is come to a fine pass when such fellows as
you get commissions.” 102</p>
<p>In L ondon Roderick (who here = Smollett) becomes a “journeyman</p>
<p>apothecary”— a druggist’s assistant. He escapes marriage by finding
his be - trothed in bed with another man. “Heaven gave me patience and
presence of mind to withdraw immediately, and I thanked my stars a
thousand times for the happy discovery by which I resolved to profit so
much as to aban- don all thoughts of marriage for the future.” 103 He
contents himself with promiscuity, learns the ways and woes of
streetwalkers, cures their infec- tions, denounces the quacks that
fleece them, and notes how the prostitute, “although often complained of
as a nuisance, still escapes through her in -</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>terest with the justices, to whom she and all of her employment pay
con- tributions quarterly for protection.” 104</p>
<p>Wrongly accused of theft, he loses his job, and falls into such
destitution that “I saw no resource but the army and navy.” He is saved
t he torment of deciding by a press gang that knocks him unconscious and
drags him aboard H. M. S. Thunder. He accepts his fate, and becomes
surgeon’s mate. Only after a day at sea does he perceive that Captain
Oakum is a half- insane brute, who for econ omy’s sake keeps sick
sailors at work till they die. Roderick fights at Cartagena; he is
shipwrecked, swims ashore to Jamaica, becomes footman to an old run-
down poetess, falls “in love” with her niece Narcissa, and “conceived
hopes of one day enjoying this amiable crea- ture.” 105 And so the
narrative runs on, in Smollett’s breathless flow, in paragraphs three
pages long, in language simple, vigorous, and profane. In London
Roderick makes a new set of eccentric friends, including Miss Melinda
Goosetrap and Miss Biddy Gripewell. Then to Bath, with more coach
scenes; there he encounters sweet Narcissa, wins her love, loses her,
fights a duel. . . . He rejoins the navy as surgeon, sails to Guinea
(where his captain “buys” four hundred slaves to sell them in Paraguay
“to great advantage”), again to Jamaica, where he finds his long -lost,
now moneyed father; back to Europe; back to Narcissa; marriage; back to
Scotland and the paternal estate; Narcissa “begins to grow remarkably
round in the waist.” A s for Roderick,</p>
<p>If there be such a thing as true happiness on earth, I enjoy it.
The</p>
<p>tempestuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed
into endearing fondness and tranquillity of love, rooted by that
intimate connection and interchange of hearts which nought but virtuous
wed- lock can produce.</p>
<p>Roderick Random had a good sale. Smollett insisted now on publishing
his play, The Regicide , with a prefatory annihilation of those who had
re- jected it; throughout his career he gave his temper carte blanche to
make enemies. He went up to Aberdeen in 1750 and received the degree in
medi- cine; but his personality impeded his practice, and he sank back
into litera- ture. In 1751 he brought forth The Adventures of Peregrine
Pickle ; here, as in Random , the title invited the reader to a round of
exciting incidents in a wandering life; but now Smollett struck a vein
of salty humor in his most successful character. Commodore Trunnion is
described as “a very oddis h kind of gentleman”; he has been “a great
warrior in his time, and lost an eye and a heel in the service”; 106 he
insists on telling, for the nth</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>east wind singing through a cranny,” gave the required support.
(Here, perhaps, Sterne took some hints for Uncle Toby and Corporal
Trim.)</p>
<p>Smollett frolics through a boisterous account of how Mrs. Grizzle
courts the Commodore, whose one-legged lieutenant, Jack Hatchway, begs
him not to let her “bring him to under her stem,” for “if once you are
made fast to her poop, egad, she’ll spank it away, and make every beam
in your body crack with straining.” The Commodore reassures him, “No man
shall</p>
<p>ever see Hawser Trunnion laying astern in the wake of e’er a b h
in</p>
<p>Christend om.” 107 Sundry stratagems, however, break down his
chastity; he consents to “grapple”— i.e., marry; but he goes to the
splicing “like a felon to execution, … as if every moment he dreaded the
dissolution of Na- ture.” He insists upon a hammock as a m arriage bed;
it breaks under the double load, but not before the lady “thought her
great aim accomplished, and her authority secured against all the shocks
of fortune.” Nevertheless this navel engagement ends without issue, and
Mrs. Trunnion falls back upon brandy and “the duties of religion, which
she performed with a most rancorous severity.”</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott pictured Smollett in his forties as “eminently
handsome, his features prepossessing, and, by the joint testimony of all
his surviving friends, his conversation in the highest degree
instructive and amusing.” 108 By all accounts he was a man of hot temper
and vivid speech. So he de- scribed Sir Charles Knowles as “an admiral
without conduct, an engineer without knowledge, an officer without
resolution, and a man without ve- racity.” 109 The Admiral prosecuted
him for libel, and Smollett suffered three months’ imprisonment and a
fine of a hundred pounds (1757). Along with his irascibility went many
virtues: he was generous and humane, helped poor authors, and became,
said Sir Walter, “a doting father and an affectionate husband.” 110 His
house in Lawrence Lane, Chelsea, was a rendezvous of minor scribes, who
took his food if not his advice; some of them he organized into a corps
of literary aides. He was one of the first prose writers (Dryden the
first poet? ) to make the booksellers support him in a condition
befitting his genius. He earned sometimes six hundred pounds in a year,
but he had to work hard for them. He wrote three more novels, two of
them negligible; he persuaded Garrick to produce his play The Reprisal,
which won success with its attacks upon France; he contributed
pugnaciously to several magazines, and edited The Briton as a Tory
mouth- piece. He translated Gil Bias, several works of Voltaire, and
(with the help of an earlier version) Don Quixote; and he wrote — or
presided over — a nine- volume History of England (1757- 65). Certainly
he used his “literary fac - tory” of Grub Street hacks in compiling a
Univers al History, and an eight- volume Present State of the
Nations.</p>
<p>By 1763, aged forty-two, he had paid with broken health for his
eager</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>life of adventure, work, brawls, and vocabulary. His physician
advised him to consult a specialist, Dr. Fizes, at Montpellier. He went,
and was told that his asthma, cough, and purulent expectoration
indicated tuberculosis. Loath to return to England’s verdant moisture,
he remained on the Continent for two years, covering his costs by
writing Travels through France and Italy (17 66). Here, as in his
novels, he showed his quick, sharp eye for the signs and mannerisms of
individual and national character; but he peppered his description with
candid vituperation. He told coachmen, fellow travelers, innkeepers,
servants, and foreign patriots just what he thought of them; he
challenged every bill, demolished French and Italian art, belabored Ca-
tholicism, and dismissed the French as acquisitive thieves who did not
al- ways coat their thefts with courtesy. Hear him:</p>
<p>If a Frenchman is admitted into your family . . . the first return
he</p>
<p>makes for your civilities is to make love to your wife, if she is
hand-</p>
<p>some; if not, to your sister, or daughter, or niece, … or grand-</p>
<p>mother. … If he is detected … he impudently declares that what</p>
<p>he had done was no more than simple gallantry, considered in France
as indispensable to good breeding. 111</p>
<p>Smollett returned to England much improved in health. But in 1768 his
ailments revived, and he sought a cure in Bath. He found its waters
useless to him, and its damp air dangerous; in 1769 he was back in
Italy. In a villa near Leghorn he wrote his last and best book, The
Expedition of Hum- phrey Clinker, which Thackeray thought “the most
laughable story that has ever been written since the goodly art of
novel- writing began.” 112 It is certainly the most pleasant and amiable
of Smollett’s books, if we can</p>
<p>stomach a little scatology. Almost at the outset we meet Dr. L n,
who</p>
<p>discourses on “good” or “bad” smells as purely subjective prejudices,
“for that every person who pretended to nauseate the smell of another’s
excre - tions snuffed up his own with particular complacency; for the
truth of which he appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen there
present”; 113 fol - lowed by a page or two of still more pungent
illustrations. Having relieved himself of this morsel, Smollett went on
to invent a jolly gamut of charac- ters, who carry the narrative forward
by their letters in the most incredible and delightful way. At their
head is Matthew Bramble, an “old gentleman” and invincible bachelor who
serves as Smollett’s voice. He goes to Bath for health, but finds the
stench of its waters more impressive than their curative power. He hates
crowds, and once faints at their corporate odor. He cannot bear the
polluted air of London, or its adulterated foods:</p>
<p>The bread I eat in London is a deleterious paste, mixed up with</p>
<p>chalk, alum, and bone ashes; insipid to the taste and destructive to
the</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>constitution. The good people are not ignorant of this adulteration,
but they prefer it to wholesome bread, because it is whiter. . . . Thus
they sacrifice their taste and their health, . . . and the miller or the
baker is obliged to poison them. . . . The same monstrous depravity
appears in their veal, which is bleached by repeated bleedings, and
other villain- ous arts, … so that a man might dine as comfortably on a
fricassee of kidskin gloves. … You will hardly believe that they can be
so mad as</p>
<p>to boil their greens with brass half-pence in order to improve
their</p>
<p>color. 114</p>
<p>So Matthew hurries back to his rural estate, where he can breathe and
eat without risking his life. En route, after the story is one-fourth
told, he picks up a poor, half- naked country lad, Humphrey Clinker;
“his looks denoted famine, and the rags that he wore could hardly
conceal what decency re- quires to be covered.” This ragamuffin offers
to drive the coach; but when he takes the high seat his aged breeches
split, and Mrs. Tabitha Bramble (Matthew’s sister) complains that
Humphrey “had the impudence to shock her sight by showing his bare
posteriors.” Matthew clothes the boy, takes him into his service, and
bears with him patiently even when the youth, having heard George
Whitefield, becomes a Methodist preacher.</p>
<p>Another facet of the religious situation appears in Mr. H 1, whom</p>
<p>Bramble meets in Scarborough, and who boasts of having conferred with
Voltaire at Geneva “about giving the last blow to the Christian supersti
- tion.” 115 Another maverick, Captain Lisma hago, enters the story at
Durham —“a tall, meager figure, answering, with horse, to the
description of Don Quixote mounted on Rozinante.” He has lived among
North American Indians, and he tells with relish how these roasted two
French missionaries for saying that God had allowed his son “to enter
the bowels of a woman, and be executed as a malefactor,” and for
pretending that they could “mul - tiply God ad infinitum by the help of
a little flour and water.” Lismahago “dwelt much upon the words reason,
philosophy , and contradiction in terms; he bade defiance to the
eternity of hell-fire; and even threw such squibs at the immortality of
the soul as singed a little the whiskers of Mrs. Tabitha’s faith.”
116</p>
<p>Smollett never saw Humphrey Clinker in print. On September 17, 1771,
he died in his Italian villa, aged fifty, having made more enemies and
cre- ated more vivacious characters than any other writer of his time.
We miss in him the good nature, the healthy acceptance of life, and the
painstaking construction of plot, that we find in Fielding; but there is
a lusty vitality in Smollett, the tang and smell of Britain’s towns and
ships and middle class; and his simple episodic narrative flows on more
freely and vividly, unim- peded by homilies. Characterization is less
striking in Fielding, but more complex; Smollett is often content to
accumulate mannerisms instead of</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>exploring the contradictions, doubts, and tentatives that make a
personality. This mode of individualization — by exaggerating some
peculiarity as a leitmotiv in each person — passed down to Dickens,
whose Pickwick Papers continued the tour that Matthew Bramble began.</p>
<p>Taken together, Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett describe
mid-eight- eenth-century England more fully and graphically than any or
all the historians — who lose themselves in exceptions. Everything is
here but that</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>LADY MARY</li>
</ol>
<p>So England familiarly called the most brilliant Englishwoman of
her</p>
<p>generation, who entered into the history of manners by striking at
the conventions that imprisoned her sex, and who entered into the
history of literature by writing letters that rival Mme. de
Sevigne’s.</p>
<p>She had a good start; she was granddaughter of Sir John Evelyn, and
daughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, who, in the year of her birth (1689), was
elected to Parliament, and soon thereafter succeeded to a rich estate as
Earl of Kingston; hence his daughter was Lady Mary from her infancy. Her
mother, Lady Mary Feilding (so she spelled it), had an earl for her
father, and the novelist for her cousin. She died when our present
heroine was only four. The father sent his children to be reared by his
mother; when she passed away they returned to his luxurious country
seat, Thoresby Park, in Nottinghamshire; and sometimes they lived in his
town house in Piccadilly. He was especially fond of Mary, whom he
nominated, aged eight, as toast of the year at the Kit-Cat Club; there
she moved from lap to lap, and impishly displayed her wit. Helped by a
governess, she educated herself in her father’s library, spending there
sometimes eight hours a day, absorbing French romances and English
plays. She gathered some French and Italian, and taught herself Latin
with Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Addison, Steele, and Congreve frequented the
house, encouraged her studies, and stirred her eager mind. We are told,
on no authority but her own, that’ it was her knowledge of the Latin
classics that won her the attention of Edward Wortley.</p>
<p>He was a grandson of Edward Montagu, first Earl of Sandwich; his</p>
<p>father, Sidney Montagu, had taken the name Wortley on marrying an
heiress of that name. Edward, when he met Mary (1708), was already, at
thirty, a man of mark and great expectations; he had a university
education,</p>
<p>20 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>had been called to the bar at twenty-one, had won a seat in
Parliament at twenty-seven. We do not know how her courtship of him
began, but it made some progress, for on March 28, 1710, she wrote to
him:</p>
<p>Give me leave to say it (I know it sounds vain), I know how to
make</p>
<p>a man of sense happy; but then that man . . . must contribute some-
thing towards it himself. . . . This letter … is the first I ever
writ</p>
<p>to one of your sex, and shall be the last. You must never expect
an-</p>
<p>other. 117</p>
<p>Her Fabian strategy prospered. When she fell ill of measles he sent
her a note warme r than his wont: “I should be overjoyed to hear your
Beauty is very much impaired, could I be pleased with anything that
would give you displeasure, for it would lessen the number of Admirers.”
118 Her reply carried the campaign a step onward: “You thin k, if you
married me, I should be passionately fond of you for one month, and of
somebody else the next; neither would happen. I can esteem, I can be a
friend, but I don’t know whether I can love.” 119 This candor may have
given him pause, for in November she wrote: “You say you are not yet
determined; let me de - termine for you, and save you the trouble of
writing again. Adieu forever! Make no answer!” 120 She wrote again in
February, 17 11, to tell him, “This is the last letter I shall send .”
121 He resumed his advances, she retreated, and lured him into
precipitate pursuit. Financial considerations intervened, and parental
opposition. They planned elopement, though this meant that she could
expect no dowry from her father. She gave Wortley an honest warn- ing:
“Reflect now for the last time in what manner you must take me. I shall
come to you with only a nightgown and petticoat, and that is all you
will get with me.” 122 They met at an inn, and were married in August,
1712; henceforth she was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. This last name she
took as that of her husband’s family line; but as he was the son of a
second son, he continued to be called simply Edward Wortley.</p>
<p>Business and politics soon carried him to Durham and London, while he
left her with very modest means in divers country houses to await the
coming of her child. In April she joined Wortley in London, and there,
in May, her first child was born. Her happiness was brief, for her
husband went off to seek re-election, and soon she was complaining of
her loneli- ness; she had looked for a romantic honeymoon, he looked for
a seat in the new Parliament. His costly campaign failed, but he was
appointed a junior commissioner. He rented a house near St. James’s
Palace, and t here, in January, 1715, Lady Mary began her conquest of
London.</p>
<p>She sampled the social whirl. She entertained on Mondays, went to the
opera on Wednesdays, to the theater on Thursdays. She visited and was
visited, fluttered about the court of George I, and nevertheless won
favor</p>

<p>with Princess Caroline. She cultivated the poets, and bandied wit
with Pope and Gay. Pope was fascinated by her alert intelligence; he
forgot for a moment his scorn of the subtler sex, applauded her efforts
for the educa- tion of girls, and dedicated to her some hurried
rhymes:</p>
<p>In beauty or wit</p>
<p>No mortal as yet</p>
<p>To question your empire has dared;</p>
<p>But men of discerning</p>
<p>Have thought that in learning,</p>
<p>To yield to a lady was hard.</p>
<p>Impertinent schools</p>
<p>With musty dull rules</p>
<p>Have reading to females denied;</p>
<p>So Papists refuse</p>
<p>The Bible to use,</p>
<p>Lest flocks be as wise as their guide</p>
<p>’Twas a woman at first</p>
<p>(Indeed she was curs’d)</p>
<p>In knowledge that tasted delight;</p>
<p>And sages agree</p>
<p>The laws should decree</p>
<p>To the first possessor the right.</p>
<p>Then bravely, fair dame,</p>
<p>Resume the old claim,</p>
<p>Which to your whole sex does belong;</p>
<p>And let men receive</p>
<p>From a second bright Eve</p>
<p>The knowledge of right and of wrong.</p>
<p>But if the first Eve</p>
<p>Hard doom did receive</p>
<p>When only one apple had she,</p>
<p>What a punishment new</p>
<p>Shall be found out for you,</p>
<p>Who, tasting, have robbed the whole tree ? 123</p>
<p>Gay now composed an eclogue, “The Toilet,” in which some London
celebrities were satirized under transparent pseudonyms. Lady Mary took
a hand in the game. With help from Gay and Pope, she wrote two eclogues
whose cutting couplets rivaled theirs in elegance and pricking point.
She did not publish these poems, but she allowed manuscript copies to
pass among her friends. She now acquired the reputation of a female
Pope, adept with pen and rhyme and wounds.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>In December, 1715, she suffered a blow sharper than her darts. Small-
pox, which had killed her brother, attacked her so severely that gossip
talked of her death. She survived, but her face was pockmarked, her
lashes had fallen out; only her brilliant black eyes remained of the
beauty on which she had counted as a help to her husband’s advancement.
Wortley got his plum nevertheless; in A pril, 1716, he was appointed
“ambassador extraordinary” to the court of Turkey. Lady Mary was
delighted; she had dreamed of the East as the land of romance, and even
with her husband along she might find romance in Constantinople or on
the way. Pope, also touched with fantasy, wrote to her on July 1 a
letter that elegantly skirted the precipice of love:</p>
<p>If I thought I should not see you again, I would say some things here
which I could not to your Person. For I would not have you die</p>
<p>deceived in me, that is, go to Constantinople without knowing
that</p>
<p>I am, to some degree of Extravagance, as well as with the utmost Rea-
son, Madam —</p>
<p>and then signed with the usual flourish of humble and obedient
servitude. 124</p>
<p>On August 1 Wortley, Mary, their three-year-old son, and a large
reti- nue crossed to Holland. They passed down through Cologne to
Regens- burg, where they embarked on a houseboat which twelve oarsmen
rowed past castled mountaintops. At Vienna she found a letter from Pope
offering her his heart and assuring her</p>
<p>not that I think everybody naked altogether so fine a sight as
yourself and a few more would be. … You may easily imagine how
desirous</p>
<p>I must be of a correspondence with a person who had taught me, long
ago, that it was as impossible to esteem at first sight as to love; and
who has since ruined me for all the conversation of one sex, and
almost</p>
<p>all the friendship of the other. Books have lost their effect upon
me, and I was convinced, since I saw you, that there is something
more</p>
<p>powerful than philosophy, and, since I heard you, that there is
one</p>
<p>alive wiser than all the sages . 125</p>
<p>But he added the hope that she would be happy with her husband. She
replied:</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll laugh at me for thanking you very gravely for all
the</p>
<p>obliging concern you express for me. ’Tis certain that I may, if I
please, take the fine things you say to me for wit and raillery, and, it
may</p>
<p>be, it would be taking them right. But I never in my life was half
so</p>
<p>well disposed to believe you in earnest . 126</p>
<p>On February 3, 1717, Pope dispatched another declaration of profound
affection, protesting against being considered “only her friend.”
These</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>letters Mary kept to herself, happy to have stirred the ruins of the
greatest living poet.</p>
<p>The party reached Constantinople in May. There Mary set about reso-
lutely to learn Turkish; she progressed to the understanding and
admiration of Turkish poetry; she adopted Turkish dress, visited harem
ladies, and found them more civilized than the mistresses of George I.
She observed the regular and successful practice of inoculation in
Turkey as a preventive of smallpox; and she had her son inoculated by
the English surgeon Dr. Maitland in Constantinople. Her letters from
that city are as fascinating as any letters this side of Mme. de
Sevigne, Horace Walpole, or Melchior Grimm. She did not wait to be told
that they were literature; she wrote with that aspiration, and told her
friends: “The last pleasure that fell my way was Mme. de Sevigne’s
letters; very pretty they are, but I assert, without the least vanity,
that mine will be full as entertaining forty years hence. I advise you,
therefore, to put none of them to the use of waste paper.” 127</p>
<p>Her correspondence with Pope continued. He begged her to take his
protestations seriously, but his tone was a baffling mixture of
playfulness and love. In his rakish imagination he conceived Turkey as a
“land of jeal - ousy, where the unhappy women converse with none but
eunuchs, and where the very cucumbers are brought to them cut.” And
then, thinking sadly of his misshapynness, he added: “I am capable
myself of following one I loved, not only to Constantinople, but to
those parts of India where, they tell us, the women best like the
ugliest fellows, . . . and look upon deformities as the signatures of
divine favor.” He will become a Moham - medan if she will, and will
accompany her to Mecca; if sufficiently encour- aged he will meet her in
Lombardy, “the scene of those celebrated amours between the fairy
princess and her dwarf.” 128 When he learned that she was coming home he
mounted to the semblance of ecstasy: “I write as if I were drunk; the
pleasure I take in thinking of your return transports me beyond the
bounds of common sense and decency. . . . Come, for God’s sake, come,
Lady Mary, come quickly!” 129</p>
<p>Wortley’s mission failed, and he was reca lled to London. We get a
sam- ple of eighteenth-century travel in their departure from
Constantinople on June 25, 1718, and their arrival in London on October
2. There Lady Mary resumed her life at court and with the wits, but
Pope, now marching through Homer, was busy at Stanton Harcourt. In
March, 1719, however, he moved to Twickenham, and in June, with his
help, Wortley and Lady Mary found a home there, too, sold them by Sir
Godfrey Kneller. Soon afterward Pope paid Kneller twenty guineas to
paint her portrait for him. 130 It was well done, though Kneller was
seventy-four. The hands were ex- quisite, the face almost as Oriental as
the Turkish headdress; the lips sensu- ally full, the eyes large, dark,
and still entrancing — Gay celebrated them in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>verses at this time. Pope hung the picture in his bedroom, and
commemo- rated it in a poem which he sent to her:</p>
<p>The playful smiles around the dimpled mouth,</p>
<p>The happy air of majesty and truth; . . .</p>
<p>The equal luster of the heavenly mind,</p>
<p>Where every grace with every virtue’s joined;</p>
<p>Learning not vain, and wisdom not severe,</p>
<p>With greatness easy, and with wit sincere . . , 131</p>
<p>That year was her meridian, and the beginning of calamities. A French
visitor, Toussaint Remond, left two thousand pounds with her to invest
at her discretion; on Pope’s advice she bought South Sea Company stock;
it fell disastrously, reducing the two thousand to five hundred; when
she so reported to Remond he accused her of stealing his funds (1721).
In that same year a smallpox epidemic threatened the life of the
daughter born to her in 1718; she sent for Dr. Maitland, who had
returned from Constan- tinople, and had him inoculate the girl. We shall
see later the effect of this example on British medicine before
Jenner.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in 1722, her friendship with Pope collapsed. As late as
July they saw each other so frequently that gossip flared in Twickenham.
But in September he began to write gallant epistles to Judith Cowper, in
which, for her comfort, he mentioned an obvious decline in “the
brightest wit in the world.” Lady Mary claimed that Pope had made her a
passionate decla - ration of love, and that he had never forgiven the
levity with which she had greeted this brave enterprise. 132 He held his
peace for a while, but now and then he pointed his occasional verse with
barbs only transparently disguised. When she wrote to a friend naming
Swift, Pope, and Gay as joint authors of a ballad that he thought was
hers, he sent her a sharp re- proof; and in the Miscellanies that he
published in 1728 he printed this re- proof with flagrant clarity:</p>
<p>Such, Lady Mary, are your tricks;</p>
<p>But since you hatch, pray own your chicks;</p>
<p>You should be better skilled in nocks,</p>
<p>Nor, like your capons, serve your cocks. 133</p>
<p>In a poem called “Imitation” (1733) he referred to “furious Sappho .
. . p — x’d by her love”— i.e., infected with syphilis by a paramour.
134 Accord- ing to Horace Walpole she threatened to have him
whipped.</p>
<p>This obscene quarrel was added to the wreck of her marriage. Wortley,
resuming his place in Parliament, left her conspicuously neglected in
Twickenham. His father’s death (1727) made him a very rich man; he</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>21 I</p>
<p>supplied her material wants, but left her to her own resources for
love. Her son was proving himself a shiftless rascal. Her daughter,
growing into an intelligent and well-mannered woman, was her only
consolation. Lord Hervey tried to take the place of Pope in her life,
but he was so constituted that he could not forgive her, or his wife,
for being a woman. He must have known of Lady Mary’s division o f the
human race into men, women, and Herveys. 135</p>
<p>In 1736 an Italian meteor entered and altered her orbit. Francesco
Al- garotti, born in Venice in 1712, had already made some noise in
science and belles-lettres. In 1735 he had been the house guest of
Voltaire and Mme. du Chatelet at Cirey, where all three studied Newton.
He came to London with letters of introduction from Voltaire, was
received at court, met Hervey, and through him Lady Mary. She fell in
love with him as never with Wortley, for her heart was empty, and he was
handsome, brilliant, young; she trembled at the thought that she was
forty-seven and he twenty- four. Her road to romance seemed cleared by
the marriage of her daughter to the Earl of Bute (August, 1736). When
she heard that Algarotti was returning to Italy she dispatched to him a
letter of girlish passion:</p>
<p>I no longer know in what manner to write you. My feelings are too</p>
<p>lively; I should not be able either to explain or hide them. To
bear</p>
<p>with my letters you would have to be touched with an enthusiasm</p>
<p>like mine. I see all its folly, without any possibility of correcting

<p>self. The mere idea of seeing you has given me a transport to the</p>
<p>point of melting away. What has become of that philosophic indiffer-
ence which made the glory and tranquillity of my earlier days? I have
lost it never to find it again; and should this passion be cured, I
foresee nothing but a deadly ennui. Forgive the extravagance which you
have caused, and come to see me. 136</p>
<p>He came, and supped with her on the eve of his departure. Hervey had
also invited him, and had been refused. Furious with jealousy, he wrote
to Algarotti a bitter diatribe against Lady Mary, warning him that she
was proclaiming to all London her Italian conq uest with the boast “
Vent , vidi, viciP Possibly, but her letters to Algarotti were not those
of a conqueror.</p>
<p>How timid one is when one loves! I fear to offend you in sending</p>
<p>you this note, even though my intention is to give you pleasure.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am so mad in all that concerns you that I am not sure of my
own thoughts. . . . All that is certain is that I shall love you all mv
life long, despite your caprice and my reason. 137</p>
<p>He did not answer this letter, nor a second, nor a third, though she
spoke of suicide. A fourth letter drew a reply which came, she said, “in
very good</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>time to save the small remains of my understanding.” She offered to
follow him to Italy; he discouraged the idea, and for three years she
nursed her passion in solitude. But in 1739 she persuaded her husband
that she needed a trip to Italy. Having lost his love for her, he could
behave like a gentle- man. He saw her off when she left London, and
agreed to send her a quar- terly allowance of £ 245 from his own income,
and to transmit to her the £ 150 annual income bequeathed her by her
father. She traveled as quickly as she could to Venice, hoping to find
Algarotti there; instead he went to Berlin (1740) to live with
new-crowned Frederick II, who liked him this side of sodomy.
Disconsolate, Mary took a house on the Grand Canal, es- tablished a
salon, entertained literati and dignitaries, and received pleasant
attentions from the Venetian aristocracy and government.</p>
<p>After a year in Venice she moved to Florence, where she stayed for
two months at the Palazzo Ridolfi as the guest of Lord and Lady Pomfret.
There Horace Walpole saw her, and he sent to H. S. Conway a tender
description:</p>
<p>Did I tell you Lady Mary Wortley is here? She laughs at my Lady</p>
<p>Walpole 〔Horace’s sister -in-law〕, scolds Lady Pomfret, and is
laughed at by the whole town. Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence
must amaze anyone that never heard her name. She wears a foul mob
〔a</p>
<p>cap fastened under the chin〕 that does not cover her greasy
black</p>
<p>locks, that hang loose, never combed or curled; an old . . . blue</p>
<p>wrapper that gapes open and discloses a canvas petticoat. Her
face</p>
<p>swelled violently on one side with the remains of a partly
covered</p>
<p>with a plaister, and partly with white paint. . . . She played
pharaoh</p>
<p>two or three times at Princess Craon’s where she cheats horse and</p>
<p>foot. She is really entertaining; I have been reading her works,
which she lends out in manuscript; but they «re too womanish; I like few
of her performances . 138</p>
<p>There was a basis in fact for this caricature: it was the custom in
Italy for a woman in her own home to dress in loose and careless
comfort; and doubtless Mary’s face was badly pocked, but not certainly
with syphilis. 139 It was quite usual for authors to lend their
manuscripts to friends. Lady Mary had earned young Walpole’s displeasure
by befriending Molly Sker - rett, who had earned his displeasure by
becoming the second wife of his father. Probably Lady Mary was more than
usually careless of her ap- pearance now that Algarotti seemed
hopelessly lost to her.</p>
<p>Then, learning that Algarotti was in Turin, she hurried thither,
joined him (March, 1741), and lived with him for two months. But he
treated her with coarseness and indifference; soon they quarreled and
parted, he to Berlin, she to Genoa. There Walpole saw her again, enjoyed
her hospitality, and</p>
<p>addressed to her coach some venomous lines:</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>LITERATURE AND THE STAGE</p>
<p>2I 3</p>
<p>O chaise, who art condemned to carry</p>
<p>The rotten hide of Lady Mary,</p>
<p>To Italy’s last corner drive,</p>
<p>And prithee set her down alive;</p>
<p>Nor jumble off with jolts and blows</p>
<p>The half she yet retains of nose. 140</p>
<p>In 1760 she rejoiced to learn that her son-in-law had become a member
of George Ill’s Privy Council. On January 21, 1761, her husband died,
leaving the bulk of his estate to his daughter, and £ 1,200 a year to
his widow. Whether because his death removed some mysterious obstacle to
her return, or her son-in- law’s political prominence attracted her,
Lady Mary, after twenty-one years of absence, returned to England
(January,</p>
<p>1762).</p>
<p>She had only seven more months to live, and they were not happy. Her
pursuit of Algarotti, and such reports as Horace Walpole’s, had given
her a bad name; and her daughter, though solicitous for her mother’s
health and comfort, did not enjoy her company. In June Lady Mary began
to suffer from a tumor on the breast. She took calmly her doctor’s
confession that she had cancer; she said she had lived long enough. She
died after months of pain (August 21, 1762).</p>
<p>One of her last requests was that her letters should be published to
give her side of her story, and establish her title to remembrance. But
she had entrusted her manuscripts to her daughter, and Lady Bute, now
wife of the Prime Minister, did all she could to prevent their
publication. However, the letters written from Turkey were clandestinely
copied before being de- livered to the daughter, and they were issued in
1763. Several editions were soon sold out. Johnson and Gibbon were among
the delighted readers. The critics, who had been unmerciful to the
author during her lifetime, were now extravagant in praising her
correspondence. Smollett wrote that the letters were “never equaled by
any letter -writer of any sex, age, or na- tion”; and Voltaire rated
them as superior to Sevigne’s. 141 Lady Bute, be - fore she died in 1
794, burned her mother’s voluminous diary, but left the letters to the
discretion of her eldest son. He allowed some of them to be printed in
1803; those to Algarotti remained secret until Byron persuaded John
Murray to buy them from their Italian owner (1817). Not till 1861 was
publication complete; and Lady Mary was recognized as sharing with Pope,
Gray, Gay, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Hume in making the
literature of England the most varied, vibrant and influential of that
virile age.</p>
