<p>The Age of Romance</p>
<p>I IOO-I 300</p>
<p>I. THE LATIN REVIVAL</p>
<p>E VERY age is an age of romance, for men cannot live by bread alone,
and imagination is the staff of life. Perhaps the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries in Europe were slightly more romantic than most periods.
Besides inheriting all the mystic creatures of Europe’s faery lore, they
accepted the Christian epic in all the beauty and terror of its vision,
they made an art and religion of love and war, they saw the Crusades,
they imported a thousand tales and wonders from the East. In any case
they wrote the longest ro- mances known to history.</p>
<p>The growth of wealth and leisure and laic literacy, the rise of towns
and the middle class, the development of universities, the exaltation of
woman in religion and chivalry — all furthered the literary flowering.
As schools mul- tiplied, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Livy, Sallust,
Lucan, Seneca, Statius, Juvenal, Quintilian, Suetonius, Apuleius,
Sidonius, even the ribald Martial and Petronius, brightened with their
art and exotic world many a pedagogic or monastic retreat, perhaps, here
and there, some palace bower. From Je- rome to Alcuin to Heloi’se and
Hildebert Christian souls stole minutes from their Hours to chant the
Aeneid’s music silently. The University of Orleans particularly
cherished the classics of pagan Rome, and a horrified puritan complained
that it was the old gods, not Christ or Mary, that were wor- shiped
there. The twelfth century was almost “the Age of Ovid”; he de - throned
then the Virgil whom Alcuin had made the poet laureate of Charle-
magne’s court, and monks and ladies and “wandering scholars” alike
read</p>
<p>From such classic studies a medieval Latin arose whose diversity and
in- terest are among the most pleasant surprises of literary
exploration. St. Ber- nard, who thought so poorly of intellectual
accomplishments, wrote letters of loving tenderness, vituperative
eloquence, and masterly Latin. The ser- mons of Peter Damian, Bernard,
Abelard, and Berthold of Regensburg kept Latin a language of living
power.</p>
<p>1018</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IOI9</p>
<p>The monastic chroniclers wrote terrible Latin, but they made no claim
to offer esthetic thrills. They recorded first of all the growth and
history of their own abbeys — the elections, buildings, and deaths of
abbots, the mir- acles and quarrels of the monks; they added notes on
the eclipses, comets, droughts, floods, famines, plagues, and portents
of their time; and some of them expanded to include national, even
international, events. Few scruti- nized their sources critically, or
inquired into causes; most of them were care- lessly inaccurate, and
added a cipher or two to bring dead statistics to life; all dealt in
miracles, and showed an amiable credulity. So the French chron- iclers
assumed that France had been settled by noble Trojans, and that
Charlemagne had conquered Spain and captured Jerusalem. The Gesta Fran-
corum ( c . i ioo) attempted a relatively honest account of the First
Crusade, but the Gesta Romanorwn ( c . 1 280) provided frankly fictional
history for Chaucer, Shakespeare, and a thousand romancers. Geoffrey of
Monmouth ( c . 1 10O-54) made his Historia Britonum a kind of national
mythology, in which poets found the legends of King Lear and Arthur,
Merlin, Lancelot, Tristram, Perceval, and the Holy Grail. Still living
literature, however, are the gossipy and guileless chronicles of Jocelyn
of Bury St. Edmunds ( c . 1 200) and Fra Salimbene of Parma ( c . 1 280)
.</p>
<p>About 1 208 Saxo Lange, posthumously named Saxo Grammaticus, dedi-
cated to Archbishop Absalon of Lund his Gesta Danorum or Deeds of the
Danes, a bit bombastic, incredibly credulous, 1 but a vivid narrative
never- theless, with more continuity than in most contemporary
chronicles of the West. In Book III we learn of Amleth, Prince of
Jutland, whose uncle killed the king and married the queen. Amleth, says
Saxo, “chose to feign dullness and an utter lack of wits. This cunning
course ensured his safety.” The cour - tiers of the fratricide king
tested Amleth by putting a pretty woman in his way; he accepted her
embraces, but won her love and fidelity. They tried him with cunning
questions, but “he mingled craft and candor in such wise that there was
nothing to betoken the truth.” From such bones Shakespeare made a
man.</p>
<p>Five Latin historians in these centuries rose from chronicles to
history, even when keeping the chronicle form. William of Malmesbury ( c
. 1090-</p>
<ol start="1143" type="1">
<li>arranged the matter of his Gesta pontificum and Gesta regum An-
glorum to give a connected and lively story, trustworthy and fair, of
British prelates and kings. Ordericus Vitalis ( c . 107 5- 1143), born
in Shrewsbury, was sent as an oblate at the age of ten to the monastery
of St. Evroul in Nor- mandy; there he lived the remainder of his
sixty-eight years, never seeing his parents again. Eighteen of these
years he spent on the five volumes of his Historia ecclesiastica , only
stopping, we are told, on the coldest winter days, when his fingers were
too numb to write. It is remarkable that a mind so limited in space
should have spoken so well of varied affairs, secular as well as
ecclesiastical, with asides on the history of letters and manners and
every-</li>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>day life. Bishop Otto of Freising (c. 1 1 14-58) , in De duabus
civitatibus (On the T too Cities ) , narrated the history of religion
and the secular world from Adam to 1 146, and began a proud biography of
his nephew Frederick Bar- barossa, but died while his hero was in
mid-career. William of Tyre (c. 1 1 30-</p>
<p>90), a Frenchman born in Palestine, became chancellor to Baldwin IV
of Jerusalem, and then Archbishop of Tyre; learned French, Latin, Greek,
Arabic, and some Hebrew; and wrote in good Latin our most reliable
source for the history of the earlier Crusades — Historia rerum in
partibus transma- rinis gestarum (History of Events Overseas ) . He
sought natural explanations for all events; and his fairness in
depicting the characters of Nur-ud-din and Saladin had much to do with
the favorable opinion that Christian Europe formed of those infidel
gentlemen. Matthew Paris (c. 1200-1259) was a monk of St. Albans. As
historiographer to his abbey, and later to King Henry III, he composed
his lively Chronica maiora, covering the major events of European
history between 1235 and 1259. He wrote with clarity, accuracy, and
unexpected partialities; he condemned the “avarice that has alienated
the people from the pope,” and favored Frederick II against the papacy.
H e crowded his pages with miracles, and told the story of the Wandering
Jew (anno 1228), but he frankly recorded the skepticism with which
London- ers viewed the transference of some drops of Christ’s blood to
Westminster Abbey (1247). He drew for his book several maps of England,
the best of the period, and may himself have made the drawings that
illustrate his work. We admire his industry and learning; but his sketch
of Mohammed (anno 123 6) is an astonishing revelation of how ignorant an
educated Christian could be of Islamic history.</p>
<p>The greatest historians of this age were two Frenchmen writing in
their own language, and sharing with the troubadours and trouveres the
honor of making French a literary tongue. Geoffroy de Villehardouin
(c. 1150- c. 1218) was a noble and a warrior, of little formal
education; but precisely because he knew not the tricks of rhetoric
taught in the schools, he dictated his Conquete de Constantinople ( 1
207) in a French whose simple directness and matter-of-fact precision
made his book a classic of historiography. Not that he was impartial; he
played too intimate a role in the Fourth Crusade to see that picturesque
treachery with an objective eye; but he was there, and saw and felt
events with an immediacy that gave his book a living quality half immune
to time. Almost a century later Jean Sire de Joinville, Seneschal of
Champagne, after serving Louis IX on crusade and in France, wrote, when
he was eighty-five, his Histoire de St. Louis (1309). We are grateful to
him for describing, with artless sincerity, the human beings of history,
and for lingering on illuminating customs and anecdotes; through him we
feel the tang of the time as not even in Villehardouin. We are with him
when he leaves his castle after pawning nearly all his possessions to go
on crusade; he did not dare look back, he says, lest his heart should
melt at</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE 1021</p>
<p>sight of the wife and children whom he might never see again. He had
not the subtle and crafty mind of Villehardouin, but he had common
sense, and saw the clay in his saint. When Louis wished him to go a
second time on crusade he refused, foreseeing the hopelessness of the
enterprise. And when the pious King asked him, “Which would you ch oose
— to be a leper or to have committed a mortal sin?”</p>
<p>I, who never lied to him, answered that I would rather have commit-
ted thirty mortal sins than be a leper. When the monks had departed he
called me to him alone, and made me sit at his feet, and said: “How came
you to say that?”… And I told him that I said it again. And he</p>
<p>replied: “You spoke hastily and foolishly. For you should know
that</p>
<p>there is no leprosy so hideous as being in mortal sin.” . . . He
asked me if I washed the feet of the poor on Holy Thursday. “Sire,” said
I, “it</p>
<p>would make me sick! The feet of these villeins will I not wash.”
“In</p>
<p>truth,” said the King, “that was ill said, for you should never
disdain</p>
<p>what God did for our teaching. So I pray you, for the love of God</p>
<p>first, and then for love of me, that you accustom yourself to wash
the feet of the poor.” 2</p>
<p>Not all Lives of the Saints were as honest as this. The sense of
history, and the intellectual conscience, were so poorly developed in
medieval minds that the writers of these edifying narratives seem to
have felt that much good and little harm could come if their readers
accepted the accounts as true. Probably in most cases the authors
received the spreading tales from others, and believed what they wrote.
If we take the Lives of the Saints simply as stories we shall find them
full of interest and charm. Consider how St. Chris- topher got his name.
He was a giant of Canaan, eighteen feet tall. He entered the service of
a king because he had heard that this was the most powerful man in the
world. One day the king crossed himself at mention of the Devil;
Christopher concluded that the Devil was more powerful than the king,
and thereupon he entered the Devil’s service. But at sight of a cross on
the road - side the Devil took flight; and Christopher, reasoning that
Jesus must be stronger than Satan, dedicated himself to Christ. He found
it hard to observe the Christian fasts, there was so much of him to
feed, and his great tongue tripped over the simplest prayers. A saintly
hermit placed him on the bank of a ford whose swift waters annually
drowned many who tried to cross it; Christopher took the wayfarers on
his back and carried them dry and safe to the other shore. One day he
bore a child across the stream; he asked why it was so heavy, and the
child replied that it carried the weight of the world; safely across,
the child thanked him, said, “I am Jesus Christ,” and disappeared; and
Christopher’s staff, which he had stuck in the sand, sud - denly blo
ssomed with flowers . 8 And who was Britain’s St. George? Near Silenum,
in Libya, a dragon annually received as food a living youth or maiden,
chosen by lot, as the price of not poisoning the village with his</p>
<p>102 2 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>breath. Once the lot fell to the virgin daughter of the king. When
the fated day arrived she walked to the pond where the dragon stayed.
There St. George saw her, and asked why she wept. “Young man,” she said,
“I believe that you have a great and noble h eart, but hasten to leave
me.” He refused, and induced her to answer his question. “Fear nothing,”
he told her, “for I will help you in the name of Jesus Christ.” At that
moment the monster emerged from the water. George made the sign of the
cross, recommended himself to Christ, charged, and plunged his lance
into the beast. Then he bade the maiden throw her girdle around the neck
of the wounded dragon; she did, and the beast, yielding like any gallant
to so potent a charm, followed her docilely forever afterward. These and
other pretty tales were gathered, about 1290, into a famous book by
Iacopo de Voragine, Archbishop of Genoa; for each day in the year he
told the story of its appointed saint; and he called his book Legenda
sanctorum — Readings about the Saints. Iacopo’s collection became a
favorite with medieval read - ers, who called it Legenda aurea, the
Golden Legend. The Church counseled a certain suspension of belief in
regard to some of these stories, 4 but the people loved and accepted
them all, and perhaps were not more deceived about life than the simple
folk who absorb the popular fiction of our day.</p>
<p>The glory of medieval Latin was its verse. Much of it was poetry in
form only, for all varieties of didactic material — history, legend,
mathematics, logic, theology, medicine — were given rhythm and rhyme as
mnemonic aids. And there were epics of small moment and great length,
like Walter of Chatillon’s Alexandreis (1176), which seem to us now as
dull as Paradise Lost. There were also poetical disputations — between
body and soul, death and man, mercy and truth, rustic and cleric, man
and woman, wine and water, wine and beer, rose and violet, the poor
student and the well-fed priest, even between Helen and Ganymede as to
the rival merits of hetero- sexual and homosexual love. 6 Nothing human
was alien to medieval poetry.</p>
<p>The classic reliance on vowel quantity as the measure of meter was
aban- doned from the fifth century onward, and medieval Latin verse,
rising out of popular feeling rather than from learned art, achieved a
new poetry based on accent, rhythm, and rhyme. Such forms had existed
among the Romans before Greek meters came to them, and had clandestinely
survived a thou- sand years of the classic style. Classic forms —
hexameter, elegiac, Sapphic- remained throughout the Middle Ages, but
the Latin world had tired of them; they seemed unattuned to the moods of
piety, tenderness, delicacy, and prayer that Christianity had spread.
Simpler rhythms came, short lines of iambic feet that could convey
almost any emotion from the beating of the heart to the tread of
soldiers marching on to war.</p>
<p>Whence rhyme came to Western Christendom no one knows and many guess.
It had been used in a few pagan poems, as by Ennius, Cicero, Apu-</p>
<p>1023</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII ) THE AGE OF ROMANCE</p>
<p>leius; occasionally in Hebrew and Syriac poetry; sporadically in
Latin po- etry of the fifth century; abundantly in Arabic verse as early
as the sixth, century. Possibly the Moslem passion for rhymes affected
the Christians who touched Islam; the surfeit of rhymes, medial and
terminal, in medieval Latin verse recalls a like excess in Arabic
poetry. In any case the new forms begot an entire new corpus of Latin
poetry, utterly unlike the classic types, aston- ishing in abundance,
and of unsuspected excellence. Here, for example, is Peter Damian (
1007-72), the ascetic reformer, likening the call of Christ to the call
of a lover to a maid:</p>
<p>Quis est hie qui pulsat ad ostium? Who is this that knocks at my
door?</p>
<p>noctis rumperis somnium? Would you shatter my night s dream?</p>
<p>Me vocat: “O virginum pulcherimma. He calls me: “O loveliest of
maidens, soror, coniux, gemma splendidissima. Sister, mate, gem most
resplendent! Cito, surgens aperi, dulcissima. Quick! rise! open, most
sweet!</p>
<p>Ego sum summi regis filius,</p>
<p>primus et novissimus;</p>
<p>qui de caelis in has veni tenebras,</p>
<p>liberare captivorum animas:</p>
<p>passus mortem et multas iniurias.”</p>
<p>Mox ego dereliqui lectulum,</p>
<p>cucurri ad pessulum:</p>
<p>ut dilecto tota domus pateat,</p>
<p>et mens mea plenissime videat</p>
<p>quern videre maxime desiderat.</p>
<p>At ille iam inde transierat;</p>
<p>ostium reliquerat.</p>
<p>Quid ergo, miserrima, quid facerem?</p>
<p>Lacrymando sum secuta iuvenem</p>
<p>manus cuius plasmaverunt hominem….</p>
<p>I am the son of the highest king,</p>
<p>His first and youngest son,</p>
<p>Who from heaven has come to this</p>
<p>darkness</p>
<p>To free the souls of captives;</p>
<p>Death have I suffered, and many in-</p>
<p>juries.”</p>
<p>Quickly I left my couch,</p>
<p>Ran to the threshold,</p>
<p>That to the beloved all the house might</p>
<p>lie open,</p>
<p>And my soul might in fullest see</p>
<p>Him whom it most longs to see.</p>
<p>But he so soon had passed by,</p>
<p>Had left my door.</p>
<p>What then, miserable me, should I do?</p>
<p>Weeping I followed after the youth</p>
<p>Whose hands formed man.</p>
<p>To Peter Damian poetry was an incident; to Hildebert of Lavardin</p>
<p>(1055? — 1 133), Archbishop of Tours, it was a passion that fought
his faith for his soul. Probably from the Berenger of Tours who had
studied under Fulbert at Chartres he imbibed a love for the Latin
classics. After many tribulations he journeyed to Rome, not sure which
he sought more — papal benediction or a sight of the scenes endeared to
him by his reading. He was touched by the grandeur and decay of the old
capital, and expressed his feel- ings in classic elegiac form:</p>
<p>1024</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Par tibi, Roma, nihil, cum sis prope tota ruina;</p>
<p>quam magni fueris integra fracta doces.</p>
<p>Longa tuos fastus aetas destraxit, et arces</p>
<p>Caesaris et superum templa palude iacent.</p>
<p>Ille labor, labor ille ruit quern dirus Araxes</p>
<p>et stantem tremuit et cecidisse dolet</p>
<p>Non tamen annorum series, non flamma, nec ensis</p>
<p>ad plenum potuit hoc abolere decus.*</p>
<p>Here for a moment a medieval poet used the Latin language as nobly as
Virgil himself. But once a Christian, always a Christian. Hildebert
found more comfort in Jesus and Mary than in Jupiter and Minerva; and in
a later poem he impeccably dismissed the ancient shrines:</p>
<p>Gratior haec iactura mihi successibus illis;</p>
<p>maior sum pauper divite, stante iacens.</p>
<p>Plus aquilis vexilla crucis, plus Caesare Petrus,</p>
<p>plus cinctis ducibus vulgus inerme dedit.</p>
<p>Stans domui terras, infernum diruta pulso;</p>
<p>corpora stans, animas fracta iacensque rego.</p>
<p>Tunc miserae plebi, modo principibus tenebrarum</p>
<p>impero; tunc urbes, nunc mea regna polus.t</p>
<p>Not since Fortunatus had any Latin penned such poetry.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WINE, WOMAN, AND SONG</li>
</ol>
<p>Our knowledge of the pagan or skeptical aspects of medieval life is
nat- urally fragmentary; the past has not transmitted itself to us
impartially, ex- cept in our blood. We must all the more admire the
liberality of spirit — or the fellowship of enjoyment — that led the
monastery of Benediktbeuern (in Upper Bavaria) to preserve the
manuscript which reached print in 1847 as Carmina Burana ( Beuern Poems
) , and is now our main source for the poetry of the “wandering
scholars.” t These were not tramps; some were footloose monks straying
from their monasteries, some were clerics out of a job, most were
students en route, often by foot, between home and university, or from
one university to another. Many students stopped at taverns on the
way;</p>
<ul>
<li>“Equal to you, O Rome! there is nothing, even when you are almost a
ruin; how great you were when whole, broken you teach us. Long time has
destroyed your pride, and the citadels of Caesar sink in the marshes
with the temples of the gods. That work, that mighty work lies low which
the dire barbarian trembled to see standing and mourns to see fallen. .
. . But no lapse of years, no fire, no sword can all destroy this
glory.”</li>
</ul>
<p>t (Rome speaks:) “Sweeter to me this defeat than those victories;
greater am I poor than when rich, greater prone than standing; more than
the eagles has the standard of the cross given me, more Peter than
Caesar, more a weaponless crowd than commanders girt with arms. Standing
I mastered nations; ruined I strike the depths of the earth; standing I
ruled bodies, broken and prostrate I rule souls. Then I commanded a
miserable populace, now the princes of darkness; then cities were my
realm, now the sky.”</p>

<p>some sampled wines and women, and learned unscheduled lore. Some com-
posed songs, sang them, sold them; some abandoned hope of an
ecclesiastical career, and lived from pen to mouth by dedicating their
poetic powers to bishops or lords. They labored chiefly in France and
western Germany, but as they wrote in Latin their poems achieved an
international currency. They pretended to have an organization — the
Ordo vagorum, or guild of wan- derers; and they invented as its founder
and patron saint a mythical Rabe- laisian personage whom they called
Golias. As early as the tenth century Archbishop Walter of Sens
fulminated against the scandalous “family of Golias”; and as late as 1
227 a Church council condemned the “Goliardi” for singing parodies on
the most sacred songs of the liturgy. 3 * * 6 “They go about in public
naked,” said the Council of Salzburg in 1281; “they lie in bake ovens,
frequent taverns, games, harlots, earn their bread by their vices, and
cling with ob stinacy to their sect.” 7</p>
<p>We know only a few of these Goliardic poets individually. One was
Hugh or Hugo Primas, a canon at Orleans about 1 140, “a vile fellow,
deformed of visage,” says a rival scribe, 8 but famed “through many
provinces” for his ready wit and verse; dying of unbought poetry, and
flinging angry satires at the ecclesiastical rich; a man of great
erudition and little shame, writing coarse indecencies in hexameters
almost as chaste as Hildebert’s. Still more renowned was one whose name
is lost, but whom his admirers called Archi- poeta, the Archpoet ( c . 1
161), a German knight who preferred wine and ink to sword and blood, and
lived fitfully on the occasional charity of Rai- nald von Dassel,
archbishop-elect of Cologne and ambassador of Barbarossa at Pavia.
Rainald tried to reform him, but the poet begged off with one of the
most famous of medieval poems — the “Confession of Goliath”— whose final
stanza became a favorite drinking song in German universities.</p>

Church (“The Gos - pel According to the Silver Mark”) ; some parody the
noblest hymns, like Thomas’ Lauda Sion ; one is a Whitmanesque song of
the open road. 10 Many are doggerel, some are masterpieces of lyrica l

<p>Most of the love poetry in the Carmma is frankly sensual; there are
mo- ments of tenderness and grace, but they are brief preludes. We might
have guessed that by the side of the hymns of the Church there would
sooner or later be hymns to Venus; woman, the devoted supporter of
religion, is the chief rival of the gods. The Church listened patiently
enough to these chants of love and wine. But in 1281 a council decreed
that any cleric (therefore any student) who composed or sang licentious
or impious songs should lose his clerical rank and privileges. Such
wandering students as thereafter re- mained loyal to Golias sank to the
level of jongleurs, and fell out of literature into ribald doggerel. By
1250 the day of the goliards was over. But as they had inherited a pagan
current running beneath the Christian centuries, so their mood and
poetry secretly survived to enter the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Latin poetry itself almost died with the goliards. The thirteenth
century turned the best minds to philosophy; the classics retreated to a
minor place in the university curriculum; and the almost Augustan grace
of Hildebert and John of Salisbury had no heirs. When the thirteenth
century ended, and Dante chose Italian for his medium, the vernacular
languages became litera- ture. Even drama, child and servant of the
Church, put off its Latin dress, and spoke the peoples’ tongues.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE REBIRTH OF DRAMA</li>
</ol>
<p>The classic drama had died before the Middle Ages began, for it had
de- generated into mime and farce, and had been replaced by hippodrome
spec- tacles. The plays of Seneca and Hroswitha were literary exercises,
which apparently never reached the stage. Two lines of active continuity
remained: the mimetic rituals of agricultural festivals, and the farces
played by wan- dering minstrels and clowns in castle hall or village
square. 12</p>
<p>But in the Middle Ages, as in ancient Greece, the main fountainhead
of drama was in religious liturgy. The Mass itself was a dramatic
spectacle; the sanctuary was a sacred stage; the celebrants wore
symbolic costumes; priest and acolytes engaged in dialogue; and the
antiphonal responses of priest and choir, and of choir to choir,
suggested precisely that same evolution of drama from dialogue that had
generated the sacred Dionysian play. In the cere- monies of certain
holydays the dramatic element was explicitly developed. At Christmas, in
some religious rites of the eleventh century, men dressed as shepherds
entered the church, were greeted with “glad tidings” by a choir -</p>
<p>1028</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>boy “angel,” and worshiped a wax or plaster babe in a manger; from an
east - ern door three “kings” entered, and were guided to the manger by
a star pulled along a wire. 13 On the 28th of December certain churches
repre- sented the “slaughter of the innocents”: boy choristers marched
up nave and aisles, fell as if murdered by Herod, rose, and walked up
into the sanctuary as a symbol of mounting into heaven. 14 On Good
Friday many churches re- moved the crucifix from the altar, and carried
it to a receptacle representing the Holy Sepulcher, from which on Easter
morning it was solemnly restored to the altar in token of resurrection.
15 As far back as 380 the story of Christ’s Passion had been written as
a Euripidean drama by Gregory Nazianzen, Patriarch of Constantinople; 16
and from that time to this the Passion Play has kept its hold upon
Christian peoples. The first such play recorded as hav- ing been
performed was presented at Siena about 1 200; probably there had been
many such representations long before.</p>
<p>As the Church used architecture, sculpture, painting, and music to
impress upon the faithful the central scenes and ideas of the Christian
epic, so she appealed to the imagination, and intensified the piety, of
the people by de- veloping in increasing splendor and detail the
dramatic implications of the greater feasts. The “tropes,” or amplifying
texts added for musical elabora - tion to the liturgy, were sometimes
turned into little plays. So an “Easter trope” in a tenth -century
manuscript at St. Gall assigns this dialogue to parts of a choir divided
to represent angels and the three Marys:</p>
<p>Angels : Whom seek ye in the tomb, O servants of Christ?</p>
<p>Marys: We seek Christ that was crucified, O heavenly host.</p>
<p>Angels : He is not here; He is risen, as He foretold. Go, and an-</p>
<p>nounce that He is risen.</p>
<p>United chorus: Alleluia, the Lord has risen . 17</p>
<p>Gradually, from the twelfth century onward, the religious spectacles
grew too complex for representation within doors. A platform was set up
outside the church, and the Indus or play was performed by actors chosen
from the people and trained to memorize an extended script. The oldest
ex- tant example of this form is a twelfth-century Representation of
Adam , written in French with Latin “rubrics” in red ink as directions
to the players. Adam and Eve, dressed in white tunics, are shown playing
in an Eden rep- resented by shrubs and flowers in front of the church.
Devils appear, in those red tights that have clung to them ever since in
the theater; they run through the audience, twisting their bodies and
making horrible grimaces. They offer the forbidden fruit to Adam, who
refuses it, then to Eve, who takes it; and Eve persuades Adam. So
convicted of a desire for knowledge, Adam and Eve are fettered with
irons and are dragged off by the devils to hell — a hole in the ground,
from which comes an infernal noise of rejoicing. In a second act Cain
prepares to murder Abel. “Abel,” he announces, “you are a dead man.”</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO29</p>
<p>Abel: “Why am I a dead man?” Cain: “Do you wish to hear why I want to
kill you? … I will tell you. Because you ingratiate yourself too much
with God.” Cain flings himself upon Abel, and beats him to death. But
the author is merciful: “Abel,” reads the rubric, “shall have a saucepan
beneath his clothes.” 18</p>
<p>Such Biblical ludi were later called “mysteries,” from the Latin
minis - terium in the sense of an action; this was also the meaning of
drama. When the story was post-Biblical it was called a v liraculum or
miracle play, and usually turned on some marvelous deed of the Virgin or
the saints. Hilarius, a pupil of Abelard, composed several such short
plays ( c . 1 1 25) , in a mixture of Latin and French. By the middle of
the thirteenth century the vernacular languages were the regular medium
of such “miracles”; humor, increasingly broad, played a rising role in
them; and their subjects became more and more secular.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the farce had made its own development toward drama. The
evolution is exemplified in two short plays that have come down to us
from the pen of an Arras hunchback, Adam de la Halle (c. 1260). One of
them, Li jus Adam — the Play of Adam — is about the author himself. He
had planned to be a pr iest, but fell in love with sweet Marie. “It was
a beautiful and clear summer day, mild and green, with delightful song
of birds. In the high woods near the brook … I caught sight of her who
is now my wife, and who now</p>
<p>seems pale and yellow to me My hunger for her is satisfied.” He tells
her</p>
<p>so with peasant directness, and plans to go to Paris and the
university. Into this marital scene, with more rhyme than reason, the
author introduces a physician, a madman, a monk begging alms and
promising miracles, and a troop of fairies singing songs, like a ballet
projected by main force into a modem opera. Adam offends one of the
fairies, who lays upon him the curse of never leaving his wife. From
such nonsense there is a line of continuous development to Bernard
Shaw.</p>
<p>As secularization proceeded, the performances moved from the church
grounds to the market place or some other square in the town. There were
no theaters. For the few performances to be given — usually on some
summer festival — a temporary stage was erected, with benches for the
people and gaily decorated booths for nobilities. Surrounding houses
might be used as background and “properties.” In religious plays the
actors were young clerics; in secular plays they were town “mummers” or
wandering jongleurs; women rarely took part. As the plays strayed
farther from the church in scene and theme, they tended toward
buffoonery and obscenity, and the Church, which had given birth to the
serious drama, found herself forced to condemn the village ludi as
immoral. So Bishop Grosseteste of Lincoln classed the plays, even the
“miracles,” along with drinking bouts and the Feast of Fools, as
performances that no Christian should attend; and by such edicts as his
( 1 236-44) the actors who took part were automatically excom-</p>
<p>IO3O THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>municated. St. Thomas was more lenient, and ruled that the profession
of histrio had been ordained for the solace of humanity, and that an
actor who practiced it becomingly might, by God’s mercy, escape hell.
19</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>EPICS AND SAGAS</li>
</ol>
<p>The secularization of literature went hand in hand with the rise of
the na- tional languages. By and large, by the twelfth century, only
clerics could understand Latin, and writers who wished to reach a lay
audience were com- pelled to use the vernacular tongues. As social order
grew, the reading audi- ence widened, and national literatures rose to
meet its demand. French litera- ture began in the eleventh century,
German in the twelfth, English, Spanish, and Italian in the
thirteenth.</p>
<p>The natural early form of these indigenous literatures was the
popular song. The song was drawn out into the ballad; and the ballad, by
prolifera- tion or agglutination, swelled into such minor epics as
Beowulf , the Chanson de Roland, the Nibelungenlied, and the Cid. The
Chanson was probably put together about 1130 from ballads of the ninth
or tenth century. In 4000 sim- ple, flowing iambic lines it tells the
story of Roland’s death at Roncesvalles. Charle magne, having
“conquered” Moorish Spain, turns back with his army toward France; the
traitorous Ganelon reveals their route to the enemy; and Roland
volunteers to lead the dangerous rear guard. In a narrow winding gorge
of the Pyrenees a horde of Basques pours down from the cliffs upon
Roland’s little force. His friend Olivier begs him to sound his great
horn as a call to Charlemagne for aid, but Roland proudly refuses to ask
for help. He and Olivier and Archbishop Turpin lead their troops in a
desperate resist- ance, and they fight till nearly all are dead.
Olivier, blinded by blood flowing from mortal wounds in his head,
mistakes Roland for an enemy, and strikes him. Roland’s helmet is split
from crown to nosepiece, but saves him.</p>
<p>At this blow Roland looks at him,</p>
<p>Asks him gently and softly:</p>
<p>“Sir comrade, do you this in earnest?</p>
<p>I am that Roland who loves you so well.</p>
<p>In no wise have you sent me defiance.”</p>
<p>Says Olivier: “Now I hear you speak;</p>
<p>I do not see you. God see and save you!</p>
<p>Struck you have I. Forgive it to me!”</p>
<p>Roland replies: “I have no injury.</p>
<p>I forgive you here and before God.”</p>
<p>At this word one to the other bows;</p>
<p>And with such love they part . 20</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO31</p>
<p>Roland at last blows his oliphant, blows till the blood bursts from
his tem- ples. Charlemagne hears, and turns back to the rescue, “his
white beard flying in the wind.” But the way is long; “high are the
mountains, vast and dark; deep are the valleys, swift the streams.” Mean
while Roland mourns over the corpse of Olivier, and says to it: “Sir
comrade, we have been together</p>
<p>About 1 1 60 an unknown poet, romantically idealizing the character
and exploits of Ruy or Rodrigo Diaz (d. 1099), gave a national epic to
Spain in the Foema del Cid. Here too the theme is the struggle of
Christian knights against the Spanish Moors, the exaltation of feudal
courage, honor, and mag- nanimity, the glory of war rather than the
servitude of love. So Rodrigo, banished by an ungrateful king, leaves
his wife and children in a nunnery, and vows never to live with them
again until he has won five battles. He goes to fight the Moors, and the
first half of the poem resounds with Homeric victories. Between battles
the Cid robs Jews, scatters alms among the poor, feeds a leper, eats
from the same dish with him, sleeps in the same bed, and discovers him
to be Lazarus, whom Christ raised from the dead. This, of course, is not
the Cid of history, but it does no greater injury to fact than the
Chanson with its idealization of Charlemagne. The Cid became a heady
stimulant to Spanish thought and pride; hundreds of ballads were
composed about its hero, and a hundred histories more or less
historical. There are few things in the world so unpopular as truth, and
the backbone of men and states is a concatenation of romance.</p>
<p>No one has yet explained why little Iceland, harassed by the elements
and isolated by the sea, should have produced in this period a
literature of scope and brilliance quite out of proportion to its place
and size. Two circum- stances helped: a rich store of orally transmitted
historical traditions, dear to any segregated group; and a habit of
reading — or being read to — which was</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO32</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>favored by long winter nights. Already in the twelfth century there
were many private libraries in the island, in addition to those in the
monasteries. When writing became a familiar accomplishment, laymen as
well as priests put this racial lore, once the property of scalds, into
literary form.</p>
<p>By a rare anomaly the leading writer of thirteenth-century Iceland
was also its richest man, and twice the president of the republic — the
“speaker of the law.” Snorri Sturluson ( 1 178 -1241) loved life more
than letters; he trav- eled widely, engaged vigorously in politics and
feuds, and was murdered by his son-in-law at sixty-two. His Heimskringla
— The Round World — told Norse history and legend with a spare and brief
simplicity natural to a man of action. His Edda Snorra Sturlusonar, or
Prose Edda, gave a summary of Biblical history, a synopsis of Norse
mythology, an essay on poetic meters, a treatise on the art of poetry,
and a unique explanation of the art’s urological origin. Two warring
groups of gods made peace by spitting into a jar; from this spittle was
formed a demigod, Kvasir, who taught men wisdom like Prometheus. Kvasir
was slain by dwarfs, who mixed his blood with wine and produced a nectar
that conferred the gift of song on all who drank of it. The great god
Odin found his way to where the dwarfs had stored this poetic wine,
drank it all up, and flew to heaven. But some of the pent-up liquid
escaped from him by a means rarely used in public fountains; this divine
stream fell in an inspiring spray upon the earth; and those who were
bedewed by it imbibed the gift of poesy. 21 It was a learned man’s
nonsense, quite as</p>
<p>The literature of Iceland in this period is astonishingly rich, and
still alive with interest, vivacity, humor, and a poetic charm that
pervades its prose. Hundreds of sagas were written, some brief, some as
long as a novel, some historical, most of them mingling history and
myth. In general they were civilized memories of a barbarous age,
compact of honor and violence, complicated with litigation, and
mitigated with love. The Ynglinga sagas of Snorri repeatedly tell of
Norse knights who burned one another, or themselves, in their halls or
cups. The most fertile of these legends was the V olsungasaga. Its
stories had an early form in the Elder or Poetic Edda; they have their
latest form in Wagner’s Ring of the Nibelungs.</p>
<p>A Volsung was any descendant of Waels, a Norse king, who was</p>
<p>great-grandson of Odin and grandfather to Sigurd (Siegfried). In the
Nibelungenlied the Nibelungs are Burgundian kings; in the V olsungasaga
they are a race of dwarfs guarding in the Rhine a gold treasure and ring
which are infinitely precious but bring a curse and misfortune to all
who possess them. Sigurd slays Fafnir the dragon guardian of the hoard,
and cap- tures it. On his wanderings he comes to a fire-encircled hill,
on which the Valkyrie (an Odin-descended demigoddess) Brunhild sleeps;
this is one form of the Sleeping Beauty tale. Sigurd is ravished by her
beauty, and she is ravished; they plight their troth; and then — as is
the way of men in many</p>
<p>CHAP, xxxvni) the age of romance 1033</p>
<p>medieval romances — he leaves her and resumes his travels. At the
court of Giuki, a Rhine king, he finds the princess Gudrun. Her mother
gives him an enchanted drink, which enables him to forget Brunhild and
marry Gu- drun. Gunnar, son of Giuki, marries Brunhild, and brings her
to the court. Resenting Sigurd’s amnesia, she has him killed; then in
remorse she mounts his funeral pyre, slays herself with his sword, and
is consumed with him.</p>
<p>The most modern in form of these Icelandic sagas is The Story of
Burnt Njal ( c . 1220) . The characters are sharply defined by their
deeds and words rather than by description; the tale is well
constructed, and moves with in- herent fatality through stirring events
to the central catastrophe — the burn- ing of Njal’s house, with himself
and his wife Bergthora and his sons, by an armed band of enemies led by
one Flosi, and bent on blood vengeance against Njal’s sons .</p>
<p>Then Flosi . . . called out to Njal, and said,</p>
<p>“I will offer thee, master Njal, leave to go out, for it is
unworthy</p>
<p>that thou shouldst burn indoors.”</p>
<p>“I will not go out,” said Njal, “for I am an old man, and little
fitted</p>
<p>to avenge my sons, but I will not live in shame.”</p>
<p>Then Flosi said to Bergthora, “Come thou out, housewife, for I
will</p>
<p>for no sake burn thee indoors.”</p>
<p>“I was given away to Njal young,” said Bergthora, “and I have</p>
<p>promised him this, that we would both share the same fate.”</p>
<p>After that they both went back into the house.</p>
<p>“What counsel shall we now take?” said Bergthora.</p>
<p>“We will go to our bed,” said Njal, “and lay us down; I have long</p>
<p>been eager for rest.”</p>
<p>Then she said to the boy Thord, Kari’s son, “Thee will I take ou
t,</p>
<p>and thou shalt not burn in here.”</p>
<p>“Thou hast promised me this, grandmother,” said the boy, “that we</p>
<p>Then she bore the boy to her bed, and . . . put him between
herself</p>
<p>and Njal. Then they signed themselves and the boy with the cross,</p>
<p>and gave over their souls into God’s hand; and that was the last word
men heard them utter. 22</p>
<p>The age of the migrations (300-600) had deposited in the confused</p>
<p>memory of peoples and minstrels a thousand stories of social chaos,
barbaric courage, and murderous love. Some of these tales were carried
to Norway and Iceland, and produced the V olsungasaga many, with kindred
names and themes, lived and multiplied in Germany in the form of
legends, ballads, and sagas. At an unknown time in the twelfth century
an unknown German, uniting and transforming such materials, composed the
Nibelungenlied , or Song of the Nibelimgs. Its form is a concatenation
of rhyming couplets in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO34</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Middle High German; its narrative is a brew of primitive passions and
pagan moods.</p>
<p>Sometime in the fourth century King Gunther and his two brothers
ruled Burgundy from their castle at Worms on the Rhine; and with them
dwelt their young sister Kriemhild — “in no land was any fairer.” In
those days King Sieg - mund governed the Lowlands, and enfeoffed his son
Siegfried (Sigurd) with a rich estate near Xanten, also on the Rhine.
Hearing of Kriemhild’s loveliness, Siegfried invited himself to
Gunther’s court, made himself welcome there, lived there for a year, but
never saw Kriemhild, though she, looking from her high window upon the
youths tilting in the courtyard, loved him from the first. Sieg- fried
surpassed all in jousts, and fought bravely for the Burgundians in their
wars. When Gunther celebrated a victorious peace he bade the ladies join
the feast.</p>
<p>Many a noble maiden adorned herself with care, and the youths</p>
<p>longed exceedingly to find favor in their eyes, and had not taken a
rich King’s land in lieu thereof. . . . And lo, Kriemhild appeared, like
the</p>
<p>dawn from out the dark clouds; and he that had borne her so long
in</p>
<p>his heart was no more aweary And Siegfried joyed and sorrowed,</p>
<p>for he said in his heart, “How should I woo such as thee? Surely it
was a vain dream; yet I were liefer dead than a stranger to thee”. . . .
Her color was kindled when she saw before her the high-minded man, and s
he said, “Welcome, Sir Siegfried, noble knight and good.” His cour - age
rose at her words; and graceful as beseemed a knight he bowed himself
before her and thanked her. And love that is mighty con-</p>

<p>Gunther, unmarried, hears of the Icelandic queen Brunhild; but she,
he is in- formed, can be won only by one who excels her in three trials
of strength; and if he fails in any, he forfeits his head. Siegfried
agrees to help Gunther win Brunhild if the King will give him Kriemhild
to wife. They cross the sea with the speed and ease of romance;
Siegfried, made invisible by a magic cape, helps Gunther meet the tests;
and Gunther brings the reluctant Brunhild home as his bride. Eighty-six
damsels help Kriemhild prepare rich garments for her. In a double
marriage of great pomp Gunther weds Brunhild, and Siegfried is joined to
Kriemhild.</p>
<p>But Brunhild, seeing Siegfried, feels that he, not Gunther, was meant
to be her mate. When Gunther goes in to her on their marriage night she
repulses him, ties him in a knot, and hangs him up on the wall. Gunther,
released, begs Siegfried’s aid; the hero, on the next night, disguises
himself as Gunther, and lies beside Brunhild, while Gunther, hidden in
the darkened room, hears all and sees nothing. Brunhild throws Siegfried
out of bed, and engages him in a bone-crunching, head- cracking combat
quite without rules. “Alas,” he says to himself amid the fight, “if I
lose my life by the hand of a woman, all wives evermore will make light
of their husbands.” Brunhild is finally overcome, and promises to be a
wife; Siegfried re - tires unseen, bearing away her girdle and her ring;
and Gunther # takes his place beside the exhausted queen. Siegfried
makes a present of the girdle and ring to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO35</p>
<p>Kriemhild. He brings her to his father, who crowns him King of the
Lowlands. Using his Nibelungen wealth, Siegfried clothes his wife and
her maidens more richly than ever women were robed before.</p>
<p>Some time later Kriemhild visits Brunhild at Worms; Brunhild, jealous
of Kriemhild’s finery, reminds her that Siegfried is Gunther’s vassal.
Kriemhild re - torts by showing her the girdle and ring as proof that
Siegfried, not Gunther, had overcome her. Hagen, gloomy half brother to
Gunther, rouses him against Sieg- fried; they invite him to a hunt; and
as he stoops over a brook to drink, Hagen pierces him with a spear.
Kriemhild, seeing her hero dead, “lay senseless in a swoon all that day
and night.” She inherits the Nibelung treasure as Siegfried’s widow, but
Hagen persuades Gunther to take it from her. Gunther, his brothers, and
Hagen bury it in the Rhine, and take oath never to reveal its hiding
place.</p>
<p>For thirteen years Kriemhild broods over vengeance upon Hagen and her
brothers, but finds no opportunity. Then she accepts the marriage
proposal of the widowed Etzel (Attila), King of the Huns, and goes to
Vienna to live as his queen. “So famed was Etzel’s rule that the boldest
k nights, Christian or heathen, drew ceaselessly to his court. . . . One
saw there what one never sees now — Christian and heathen together.
Howso diverse their beliefs, the King gave with such free hand that all
had plenty.” There Kriemhild “ruled virtuously” for thir - teen years,
seeming to forgo vengeance. Indeed she asks Etzel to invite her brothers
and Hagen to a feast; they accept despite Hagen’s warning, but come with
an armed retinue of yeomen and knights. While the royal brothers, Hagen,
and th e knights enjoy the hospitality of the Hun court in Etzel’s hall,

<p>She seizes his sword and strikes him dead. Then Hildebrand the Goth,
one of her warriors, surfeited with her blood lust, slays Kriemhild.</p>
<p>It is a terrible tale, as red with gore as any in literature or
beneath. We do some injustice to it by taking its direst moments from
their context of feasting, jousting, hunting, and womanly affairs; but
this is the central and bitter theme — a gentle maiden changed by the
experience of evil into a ferocious murderess. Strangely little of
Christianity is left in the story; it is rather a Greek tragedy of
nemesis, without the Greek reluctance to let violence come upon the
stage. In this stream of crime almost all feudal virtues are submerged,
even the honor of host to in- vited guest. Nothing could surpass the
barbarism of such a tale, until our time.</p>
<p>V. THE TROUBADOURS</p>
<p>At the end of the eleventh century, when we should have expected all
European letters to be colored by the religious enthusiasm of the
Crusades, there developed in southern France a school of lyric poetry
aristocratic, pagan, anticlerical, bearing the marks of Arab influence,
and signalizing the triumph of woman over the chastisement laid upon her
by the theory of the Fall. This style of verse moved from Toulouse to
Paris to London with Eleanor of Aquitaine, captured the lion heart of
her son Richard I, created the minnesingers of Germany, and molded the
Italian dolce stil nuovo that led to Dante.</p>
<p>At the origin of the style stands Eleanor’s grandfather, William IX,
Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine. This reckless blade found himself
f.t eleven (1087) the practically independent ruler of southwestern
France. He joined the First Crusade and sang its victory; but, like so
many nobles in his heresy- infected lands, he had scant respect for the
Church, and made gay mockery of her priests. A n old Provencal biography
describes him as “one of the most courteous men in the world, and a
great deceiver of ladies; and he was a brave knight and had much to do
with love affairs; and he knew well how to sing and make verses; and for
a long time he roamed all through the land to deceive the ladies.” 23
Though married, he carried off the beautiful vis - countess of
Chatellerault, and lived with her in open scandal. When the bold bald
bishop of Angouleme bade him end his wicked ways he replied, “I wi ll
repudiate the viscountess as soon as your hair requires a comb.” Excommu
- nicated, he one day met the bishop of Poitiers. “Absolve me,” he said,
“or I will kill you.” “Strike,” answered the bishop, offering his neck.
“No,” said William; “I do not love you well enough to send you to
paradise.” 24 The Duke set a style of writing amorous poetry to noble
dames. He suited the action to the word, led a short life and a merry
one, and died at fifty-six (1137). He left to Eleanor his immense
domain, and his taste for poetry and love.</p>
<p>She gathered poets about her at Toulouse, and willingly they sang for
her</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO37</p>
<p>and her court the beauty of women and the fever engendered by their
charms. Bernard de Ventadour, whose poems seemed to Petrarch only
slightly inferior to his own, began by praising the loveliness of the
viscount- ess of Ventadour; she took him so seriously that her husband
had to shut her up in his castle tower. Bernard, encouraged, turned to
chant the splen- dor of Eleanor herself, and followed her to Rouen; when
she preferred the love of two kings he emptied out his soul in a famous
dirge. A generation later the troubadour Bertrand de Bom became the
bosom friend of Richard I, and his successful rival for the love of the
most beautiful woman of her time, Dame Maenz of Martignac. Another
troubadour, Peire Vidal (1167?-</p>
<p>1215), accompanied Richard on crusade, returned intact, lived and
rhymed in amours and poverty, and received at last an estate from Count
Raymond VI of Toulouse. 25 We know the names of 446 other troubadours;
but from these four we may judge their loose melodious tribe.</p>
<p>Some were musical vagabonds; most were minor nobles with a flair for
song; four were kings — Richard I, Frederick II, Alfonso II, and Pedro
III of Aragon. For a century (1150-1250) they dominated the literature
of southern France, and molded the manners of an aristocracy emerging
from rustic brutality into a chivalry that almost redeemed war with
courtesy, and a dultery with grace. The language of the troubadours was
the langue d’oc or roman of southern France and northeastern Spain.
Their name is a puzzle; troubadour is probably from the roman word
trobar, to find or invent, as obviously the Italian trovatore is from
trovare ; but some would take it from the Arabic tarraba, to sing. 26
They called their art gai saber or gay a ciencia, “gay wisdom”; but they
took it seriously enough to undergo a long period of training in poetry,
music, and the forms and speech of gallantry; they dressed like the
nobility, flaunted a mantle trimmed with gold embroidery and costly
furs, rode often in knightly armor, entered the lists at tourna- ments,
and fought with lance as well as pen for the ladies to whom they had
pledged their lines, if not their lives. They wrote only for the
aristocracy. Usually they composed music for their own lyrics, and hired
minstrels to sing them at banquets or tournaments; but often they
themselves would strum the lute and wring a passion through a song.</p>
<p>Probably the passion was a literary form; the burning longing, the
celestial fulfillments, the tragic despair of the troubadours were
poetic license and machinery; apparently the husbands took these ardors
so, and had less sense of property than most males. Since marriage among
the aristocracy was normally an incident in a transfer of property,
romance had to come after marriage, as in French fiction; the amours of
medieval literature are, with a few exceptions, tales of illicit love,
from Francesca and Beatrice in the South to Isolde and Guinevere in the
North. The general inaccessibility of the married lady generated the
poetry of the troubadours; it is hard to ro- manticize desire fulfilled,
and where there are no impediments there is no</p>
<p>1038 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>poetry. We hear of a few troubadours who received the ultimate favor
from the ladies whom they had chosen for their lays, but this was a
breach of lit- erary etiquette; usually the poet had to sate his thirst
with a kiss or a touch of the hand. Such restraint made for refinement;
and in the thirteenth cen- tury the poetry of the troubadours — perhaps
influenced by the worship of Mary — graduated from sensualism to an
almost spiritual delicacy.</p>
<p>But they were seldom pious. Their resentment of chastity set them at
odds with the Church. Several of them lampooned prelates, ridiculed hell
, 27 de- fended the Albigensian heretics, and celebrated the victorious
crusade of the impious Frederick where the saintly Louis had failed.
Guillem Ademar ap- proved one crusade, but only because it removed a
husband from his path. Raimon Jorden preferred a night with his beloved
to any promised trans- mundane paradise . 28</p>
<p>Forms of composition seemed more important to the troubadours than
commandments of morality. The canzo was a song of love; the plante was a
dirge for a friend or lover lost to death; the tens on was a rhymed
debate on a question of love, morality, or chivalry; the sirvente was a
song of war, feud, or political attack; the sixtine was a complicated
rhyme sequence of six stanzas, each of six lines, invented by Arnaud
Daniel and much admired by Dante; the pastourelle was a dialogue between
a troubadour and a shep- herdess; the aubade or alba, a song of the
dawn, usually warned lovers that the day would soon reveal them; the
serena or serenade was an evening song; the balada was a narrative in
verse. Here is an anonymous aubade partly spoken by a twelfth-century
Juliet.</p>
<p>In a garden where the white thorn spreads her leaves,</p>
<p>My lady hath her love lain close beside her.</p>
<p>Till the warden cries the dawn — ah, dawn that grieves!</p>
<p>Ah God! ah God! that dawn should come so soon!</p>
<p>“Please God that night, dear night, should never cease,</p>
<p>Nor that my Love should parted be from me,</p>
<p>Nor watch cry ‘Dawn’— ah, dawn that slayeth peace!</p>
<p>Ah God! ah God! that dawn should come so soon!</p>
<p>“Fair friend and sweet, thy lips! Our lips again!</p>
<p>Lo, in the meadow there the birds give song.</p>
<p>Ours be the love, a nd jealousy’s the pain!</p>
<p>Ah God! ah God! that dawn should come so soon!</p>
<p>“Of that sweet wind that comes from Far -Away</p>
<p>Have I drunk deep of my Beloved’s breath,</p>
<p>Yea, of my Love’s that is so dear and gay.</p>
<p>Ah God! ah God! that dawn should come so soon! ”</p>

<p>And many watch her beauty’s gracious way.</p>
<p>Her heart toward love is nowise traitorous.</p>
<p>Ah God! ah God! that dawn should come so soon! - 9</p>
<p>The troubadour movement in France came to an end amid the thirteenth
century, partly through the increasing artificiality of its forms and
senti- ments, partly through the ruin of south France by the Albigensian
Crusades. For in that troubled time many castles fell that had harbored
troubadours; and when Toulouse itself suffered a double siege the
knightly order in Aqui- taine collapsed. Some singers fled to Spain,
some to Italy. There in the second half of the thirteenth century the
art of the love lyric was reborn, and Dante and Petrarch were scions of
the troubadours. The gay science of their gal- lantry helped to mold the
code of chivalry, and to turn the barbarians of northern Europe into
gentlemen. Literature ever since has felt the influence of those subtle
songs; and perhaps love now bears a finer fragrance from the incense of
their praise.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE MINNESINGERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The troubadour movement spread from France to southern Germany, and
flourished there in the golden age of the Hohenstaufen emperors. The
Ger- man poets were called Minnesinger, love singers, and their poetry
coincided with the Minnedienst (love service) and Frauendienst (lady
service) of contemporary chivalry. We know over 300 of these
minnesingers by name, and have a plentiful legacy of their verse. Some
of them belonged to the lower nobility; most of them were poor, and
depended upon imperial or ducal patronage. Though they followed a strict
law of rhythm and rhyme, many of them were illiterate, and dictated the
words and music of their Lieder-, to this day the German term for poetry
— Dichtung — means dictation. Usually they let minstrels sing for them;
sometimes they themselves sang. We hear of a great Sanger krieg, or song
contest, held at the Castle Wartburg in 1 207; there, we are told, both
Tannhauser and Wolfram von Eschenbach took part. 30 * For a century the
minnesingers helped to raise the status of woman in Germany, and the
ladies of the aristocracy became the life and inspiration of a culture
more refined than anything that Germany would know again till Schiller
and Goethe.</p>
<p>Wolfram and Walther von der Vogelweide are classed as minnesingers
because they wrote songs of love; but Wolfram and his Parzival may be
better viewed under the heading of romance. Walther “of the Bird -Me
adow” was born somewhere in the Tirol before 1 1 70. Knight but poor, he
made</p>

<p>matters worse by taking to poetry. We find him at twenty singing for
his bread in the homes of the Viennese aristocracy. In those youthful
years he wrote of love with a sensuous freedom frowned upon by his
rivals. His Unter den Linden is treasured to this day in Germany:</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO4I</p>
<p>As he grew older his perception matured, and he began to see in woman
charms and graces fairer than any budding flesh, and the rewards of
unity in marriage seemed richer than the surface titillations of
variety. “Happy the man, happy the woman, whose hearts are to each other
true; their lives increase in price and worth; blessed their years, and
all their days.” 33 He deprecated the adulation with which his fellow
warblers perfumed the ladies of the court; he proclaimed wip ( Weib ,
woman) a higher title than vrouive {Fran, lady); good women and good men
were the real nobility. He</p>
<p>thought “German ladies fair as God’s angels; anyone who defames them
lies in his teeth.” 34</p>
<p>In 1197 the Emperor Henry VI died, and Germany suffered a generation
of chaos until Frederick II came of age. The aristocratic patronage of
letters fell away, and Walther wandered from court to court, singing
unhappily for his meals in competition with noisy jugglers and prideless
clowns. An item in the expense account of Bishop Wolfger of Passau
reads: “Five solidi, November 12, 1203, to Walther von der Vogelweide to
buy himself a fur coat against the winter cold.” 35 It was a doubly
Christian act, for Walther was a zealous Ghibelline, tuned his lyre
against the popes, denounced the shortcomings of the Church, and raged
at the way in which German coins flew over the Alps to replenish Peter’s
Pence. 30 He was, however, a faith - ful Christian, and composed a
mighty “Crusader’s Hymn.” But at times he could stand above the battle
and see all men as brothers:</p>
<p>Mankind arises from one virgin;</p>
<p>We are alike both outward and within;</p>
<p>Our mouths are sated with the selfsame fare;</p>
<p>And when their bones into confusion fall.</p>
<p>Say ye, who knew the living man by sight,</p>
<p>Which is the villein now, and which the knight,</p>
<p>That worms have gnawed their carcasses so bare?</p>
<p>Christians, Jews, and heathens, serve they all,</p>
<p>And God has all creation in His care. 37</p>
<p>After a quarter century of wandering and poverty, Walther received
from Frederick II an estate and an income (1221), and could spend in
peace his remaining seven years. He mourned that he was too old and ill
to go on cru- sade. He begged God to forgive him for not being able to
love his enemies. 38 In a poetic testament he bequeathed his goods: “to
the envious my ill luck; to the liars my sorrows; to false lovers my
follies; to the ladies my heart’s pain.” 39 He was buried in Wurzburg
Cathedral, and near by a monument proclaims Germany’s affection for the
greatest poet of his age.</p>
<p>After him the minnesinger movement lost itself in extravaganzas, and
shared in the disasters that shattered Germany after the fall of
Frederick II. Ulrich von Lichtenstein ( c . 1200 -c. 1276) tells in his
poetic autobiography, Frauendienst, how he was reared in all the
sentiments of “lady service.” He</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO42</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>chose a lady as his goddess, had his harelip sewed up to mitigate her
repul- sion, and fought for her in tournament. When told of her surprise
that he still had a finger which she thought he had lost in her honor,
he cut off the offending member and sent it to her as tribute. He almost
swooned with delight when fortune permitted him to drink the water in
which she had washed her hands. 40 He received a letter from her, and
carried it for weeks in his pocket before he found someone whom be could
trust t6 read it for him secretly; for Ulrich could not read. 41 On
promise of her favor he waited two days in beggar’s clothing among the
lepers at her gate; she admitted him; and finding him importunate, she
had him lowered in a bed sheet from her window. All this time he had a
wife and children.</p>
<p>The minnesinger movement ended with some dignity in Henrich von Meis-
sen, whose songs in honor of women earned him the title Frauenlob, “wom
- en’s praise.” When he died at Mainz in 1317, the ladies of the city

<li>THE ROMANCES</li>

<p>But in romance the middle class had already captured the field. As
aris- tocratic troubadours and trovatori wrote delicate lyrics for the
ladies of southern France and Italy, so in northern France the poets of
humble birth — known to the French as trouveres or inventors —
brightened the evenings of the middle and upper classes with poetic
tales of love and war.</p>
<p>The typical compositions of the trouv&amp;res were the ballade , the
lai , the chanson de geste, and the roman. Some lovely examples of the
lai have come down to us from one whom both England and France may claim
as their first great poetess. Marie de France came from Brittany to live
in England in the reign of Henry II (1154-89); at his suggestion she
turned several Breton legends into verse, and with a delicacy of speech
and sentiment not excelled by any troubadour. One of her lyrics craves
room here, both for an unusual theme — the living beloved to her dead
lover — and for an exquisite translation:</p>
<p>Hath any loved you well down there,</p>
<p>Summer or winter through?</p>

<p>What charmed death holds you with deep</p>
<p>Strange lure by night and day?</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap, xxxvm</p>
<p>The chanson de geste, or song of deeds, probably arose as a
concatenation of ballads or lays. Upon a core of history usually offered
by the chronicles, the poet laid a web of fancied adventures, running in
lines of ten or twelve syllables to such lengths as only Northern winter
evenings could sustain. The Chanson de Roland was a lithe forerunner of
this genre. The favorite hero of the French chansons de geste was
Charlemagne. Great in history, the trouveres raised him to almost
supernatural grandeur in their poetry; they converted his failure in
Spain into a glorious conquest, and sent him off on triumphant
expeditions to Constantinople and Jerusalem, his legend- ary white beard
waving majesty. As Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied echoed the “heroic
age” of the migrations, so the chansons reflected the feudal era in
subject, morals, and mood; whatever their theme or scene or time, they
moved in a feudal atmosphere to feudal motives and in feudal dress.
Their constant subject was war, feudal or international or interfaith;
and amid their rough alarums woman and love found only a minor
place.</p>
<p>As social order improved, and the status of woman rose with the
growth of wealth, war yielded to love as the major theme of the
trouveres, and in the twelfth century the chansons de geste were
succeeded by the romans. Woman mounted the throne of literature, and
held it for centuries. The name roman meant at first any work written in
that early French which, as a Roman legacy, was called roman. The
romances were not called romans because they were romantic; rather
certain sentiments came to be called ro- mantic because they were found
so abundantly in the French romans. The Roman de la rose , or de Troie,
or de Renard merely meant the tale of a rose, or of Troy, or of a fox,
in roman or early French. Since no literary form should be born without
legitimate parents, we may derive the romances from the chansons de
geste crossed with the troubadour sentiment of courtly love. Some of
their material may have come from such Greek romances as the Ethiopica
of Heliodorus. One Greek book, translated into Latin in the fourth
century, had enormous influence — the fictitious biography of Alexander
falsely ascribed to his official historian Callisthenes. Alexander
stories be- came the most popular and prolific of all the “cycles” of
medieval romance</p>
<p>Richer in variety, tenderer in sentiment, was the cycle of romances —
French, English, and German — stemming from the siege of Troy. Here the
chief inspiration was not Homer but Virgil; the story of Dido was
already a romance; and had not France and England, as well as Italy,
been settled by Trojans fleeing from undeserved defeat? About 1 184 a
French trouvere, Benoit de Ste.-Maure, retold the Roman de Troie in
30,000 lines; it was translated into a dozen languages and was imitated
in a dozen literatures. In</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO45</p>
<p>Germany Wolfram von Eschenbach wrote his Bitch e von Troye, of
Iliadic size; in Italy Boccaccio took from Benoit the tale of
Filostrato; in England Layamon’s Brut (c. 1205) described in 32,000
lines the foundation of Lon - don by Brutus, the imaginary
great-grandson of Aeneas; and from Benoit came Chaucer’s Troilus and
Criseyde, and Shakespeare’s play.</p>
<p>The third great cycle of medieval romance was the Arthurian. We have
seen reason to believe that Arthur was a British Christian noble who
fought against the invading Saxons in the sixth century. Who was it that
turned him and his knights into such delectable legends as only lovers
of Malory have fully savored? Who created Gawaine, Galahad, Perceval,
Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Tristram, the Christian knightliness of the
Round Table, and the mystic story of the Holy Grail? After a century of
dis-</p>
<p>cussion no certain answer remains; inquiry is fatal to certainty. The
old- est references to Arthur are in English chroniclers. Some elements
of the legend appear in the Chronicle of Nennius (976); it was expanded
in the Historic Britonum (1137) of Geoffrey of Monmouth; Geoffrey’s
account was put into French verse by Robert Wace, a trouvere of Jersey,
in Le Brut d’ Angleterre (1155); here first we find the Round Table. The
oldest frag- ments of the legend are probably some Welsh tales now
gathered in the Mabinogion ; the oldest manuscripts of the developed
story are French; Ar- thur’s court and the Holy Grail are by common
consent located in Wales and southwestern Britain. The earliest full
presentation of the legend in prose is in an English manuscript
doubtfully ascribed to an Oxford archdeacon, Walter Map ( 1 1 37-96) .
The oldest verse form of the cycle is in the romans of Chretien de
Troyes (c. 1 140-91 ) .</p>
<p>Of Chretien’s life we know almost as little as of Arthur’s. Early in
his literary career he composed a Tristan, now lost. It reached the eyes
of the Countess Marie de Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine,
and ap- parently led her to hope that Chretien might be the man to
phrase “courtly love,” a nd the highest ideals of chivalry, in the form
of the roman. Marie invited him to be, so to speak, trouvere laureate at
her court in Troyes. Under her patronage (1160-72) he composed four
romances in rhyming couplets of eight-syllabled lines: Erec et Enide,
Cliges, Yvain, and Le Chev- alier de la charrette ( The Knight of the
Wagon) — no sublime title for the story of Lancelot the “perfect
knight.” In 1 1 75, at the court of Philip, Count of Flanders, he began
his Conte del Graal, or Perceval le Gallois, wrote 9000 lines, and left
it to be finished to 60,000 lines by another hand. The atmos- phere of
these stories appears at the outset of Erec:</p>
<p>One Easter Day King Arthur held court at Cardigan. Never was</p>
<p>seen so rich a court; for many a good knight was there, hardy, bold,
and brave, and rich ladies and damsels, gentle and fair daughters of
kings. But before the court disbanded for the day the King told his</p>
<p>knights that he wished on the morrow to hunt the White Stag, in</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO46</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>order to observe worthily the ancient custom. When my lord Gawain
heard this he was sore displeased, and said: “Sire, you will derive</p>
<p>neither thanks nor good will from this hunt. We all know long
since</p>
<p>what this custom of the White Stag is: whoever can kill the White</p>
<p>Stag must kiss the fairest maiden of your court. . . . But of this
there might come great ill; for there are here 500 damsels of high
birth, . . . and there is none of them but has a bold and valiant knight
who would be ready to contend, whether right or wrong, that she who is
his lady is the fairest and gentlest of them all.” “That I know full
well,” said</p>
<p>the King; “yet will I not desist on that account. . . . Tomorrow
we</p>
<p>shall all go gaily to hunt the White Sta g.” 44</p>
<p>And at the outset, too, the amusing exaggerations of romance: “Nature
had used all her skill in forming Enid, and Nature had marveled more
than 500 times how on this occasion she had succeeded in making so
perfect a creature.” In the Lancelot story we learn that “he who is a
perfect lover is always obedient, and quickly and gladly does his
mistress’ pleasure. . . . Suffering is sweet to him; for Love, who
guides and leads him on, assuages and relieves his pain.” 41 ’ But the
Countess Marie h ad a flexible conception of love:</p>
<p>If a knight found a damsel or lorn maid alone, and if he cared for
his fair name, he would no more treat her with dishonor than he would
cut his own throat. And if he assaulted her he would be disgraced
forever in every court. But if, while she was under his escort, she
should be</p>
<p>won at arms by another who engaged him in battle, then this other</p>
<p>knight might do with her what he pleased, without receiving shame or
blame. 40</p>
<p>Chretien’s verses are graceful but feebl e, and their dull abundance
soon surfeits our modern haste. He has the distinction of having written
the first full and extant statement of the chivalric ideal, in his
picture of a court where courtesy and honor, bravery and devoted love,
seemed of more moment than Church or creed. In his final romance
Chretien proved true to his name, and raised the Arthurian cycle to a
nobler pitch by adding to it the story of the Holy Grail. # Joseph of
Arimathea, ran the tale, had caught some of the blood falling from the
crucified Christ in the bowl from which Christ had drunk at the Last
Supper; Joseph or his offspring had brought the bowl and the
imperishable blood to Britain, where it was kept in a mysterious castle
by an ailing imprisoned king; and only a knight perfectly pure in life
and heart could find the Grail and free the king, by asking the cause of
his illness. In Chretien’s story the Grail is sought by Perceval the
Gaul; in the English form of the legend, by Galahad, the spotless son of
the tarnished Lancelot; in both versions the finder carries it off to
heaven. In Germany Wolfram</p>

<li>Grail is uncertainly traced to a hypothetical cratalis derived from

</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO47</p>
<p>von Eschenbach transformed Perceval into Parzival, and gave the tale
its most famous medieval form.</p>
<p>Wolfram ( c . 1165-c. 1220) was a Bavarian knight who risked his
stomach on his verses, found patronage from the Landgrave Hermann of
Thuringia, lived in the Castle Wartburg for twenty years, and wrote the
outstanding poem of the thirteenth century. He must have dictated it,
for we are assured that he never learned to read. He claimed to have
derived his Parzival story not from Chretien but from a Provengal poet
named Kiot. We know of no such poet, nor of any other treatment of the
legend between Chretien’s (1175) and Wolfram’s (1205). Of the sixteen
“books” in Wolfram’s poem eleven seem based on Chretien’s Conte del
Graal. The good Christians and fair knights of the Middle Ages felt no
compulsion to acknowledge their literary debts. But the matter of the
romances was felt to be common prop- erty; any man might forgivably
borrow if he could improve. And Wolfram bettered Chretien’s
tutelage.</p>
<p>Parzival is the son of a knight of Anjou by Queen Herzeleide
(Sorrowful Heart), who is a granddaughter of Titurel — the first
guardian of the Grail — and sister to Amfortas, its present ailing king.
Shortly before she bears Parzival she learns that her husband has fallen
in knightly combat before Alexandria. Resolved that Parzival shall not
die so young, she brings him up in rural solitude, conceals from him his
royal lineage, and keeps him ignorant of arms.</p>
<p>Then full sore were her people grieved, for they held it an evil
thing,</p>
<p>And a training that ill beseemed the son of a mighty king.</p>
<p>But his mother kept him hidden in the woodland valleys wild,</p>
<p>Nor thought, in her love and sorrow, how she wronged the royal</p>
<p>child.</p>
<p>No knightly weapon she gave him, save such as in childish play</p>
<p>He wrought himself from the bushes that grew on his lonely way.</p>
<p>A bow and arrows he made him, and with these, in thoughtless
glee,</p>
<p>He shot at the birds as they caroled o’erhead in the leafy tree.</p>
<p>But when the feathered songster of the woods at his feet lay
dead,</p>
<p>In wonder and dumb amazement he bowed down his golden head,</p>
<p>And in childish wrath and sorrow tore the locks of his sunny hair</p>
<p>(For I know full well, of all earth’s children was never a child
so</p>
<p>fair) ….</p>
<p>Then he thought him well how the music, which his hand had forever
stilled,</p>
<p>Had thrilled his soul with its sweetness, and his heart was with
sorrow filled . 47</p>
<p>Parzival grows to manhood healthy and ignorant. One day he sees two
knights on the road, admires their gleaming armor, thinks them gods, and
falls on his knees before them. Informed that they are not gods but
knights, he resolves to be as splendid as they. He leaves home to seek
King Arthur, who makes men knights;</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO48</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>and his mother dies of grief at his going. On his way Parzival robs a
sleeping duchess of a kiss, her girdle, and her ring; and the taint of
this deed leaves him unclean for many years. He meets Ither the Red
Knight, who sends by him a challenge to King Arthur. Presented to the
King, Parzival asks permission to as- sume the challenge; he returns to
Ither, slays him with beginner’s luck, dons his armor, and rides off to
seek adventure. At night he asks hospitality of Gurnemanz; the old baron
takes a liking to him, teaches him the tricks of feudal combat, and
gives him knightly counsel:</p>
<p>Take pity on those in need; be kind, generous, and humble. The</p>
<p>worthy man in need is ashamed to beg; anticipate his wants. . . . Yet
be prudent, neither lavish nor miserly. . . . Do not ask too many</p>
<p>questions, nor refuse to answer a question fitly asked. Observe
and</p>
<p>listen Spare him who yields, whatever wrong he has done you. . .
.</p>
<p>Be manly and gay. Hold women in respect and love; this increases a
young man’s h onor. Be constant — that is manhood’s part. Short his</p>
<p>praise who betrays honest love. 48</p>
<p>Parzival sallies forth again, rescues the besieged Kondwiramur,
marries her, challenges her returning husband to combat, kills him, and
leaves his wife in search of his mother. By chance he comes to the
castle of the Grail. He is enter- tained by its guardian knights, sees
the Grail (here a precious stone), and — remembering the good Gurnemanz’
advice— asks no question about the magic Grail or the ailing king, whom
he does not know to be his uncle. The next morn- ing he finds the whole
castle empty; he rides out, and the drawbridge rises behind him by
unseen hands, as if forbidding his return. He rejoins Arthur’s court;
but amid his welcome there the seeress Kundry accuses him of ignorance
and dis- courtesy in not having asked the cause of Amfortas’ sickness.
Parzival swears that</p>
<p>But a mood of resentment darkens his life at this point. He feels
that the disgrace that Kundry has laid upon him is unmerited; he
perceives the abundance of in- justice in the world, renounces and
denounces God, and for four years visits no church, utters no prayer. 49
In those years he suffers a hundred misfortunes, ever seeking, never
finding, the Grail. One day he stumbles upon the retreat of an
anchorite, Trevrezent, who turns out to be his uncle; learns from him
the story of the Grail, and how Amfortas’ undying illness was due to
leaving the guardian - ship of the Grail to serve an illicit love. The
hermit wins Parzival back to Christian faith, and takes upon him the
penalty of Parzival’s sins. Humbled and chastened, cured of his
ignorance and cleansed by his sufferings, Parzival resumes his quest of
the Grail. The hermit reveals to Kundry t hat Parzival is Amfortas’
nephew and heir; she finds him and announces that he has been chosen to
succeed Amfortas as king and guardian of the Grail. Guided by her to the
hidden castle, he asks Am- fortas the cause of his illness, and at once
the old king is healed. Parzival finds his wife Kondwiramur, who comes
with him to be his queen. Lohengrin is their son.</p>
<p>As if to provide Wagner with another libretto, Gottfried of
Strasbourg produced, about 1210, the most successful version of the
Tristan story. It</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO49</p>
<p>is an enthusiastic glorification of adultery and disloyalty, and
dishonors the feudal as well as the Christian moral code.</p>
<p>Tristan, like Parzival, is born to a young mother, Blanchefleur, soon
after she receives news that her prince husband has been killed in
battle; she names the infant Tristan — sorrowful — and dies. The boy is
reared and knighted by his uncle Mark, King of Cornwall. Grown up, he
excels in tournaments, and kills the Irish challenger Morold; but in the
combat he receives a poisoned wound, which the dying Morold tells him
can be cured only by Ireland’s queen Iseult. Disguised as Tantris, a
harper, Tristan visits Ireland, is cured by the queen, and becomes the
tutor of the queen’s daug hter, also named Iseult. Returning to Cornwall
he tells Mark of the young Iseult’s beauty and accomplishments, and Mark
sends him back to woo her for him. Iseult is reluctant to leave her
home; and discovering that Tristan is the slayer of her uncle Morold,
she is inflamed with hatred for him. But the mother persuades her to go,
and gives her maid Brangane a love potion to administer to Iseult and
Mark to arouse their love. The maid gives the potion by mistake to
Iseult and Tristan, who soon fall into each other’s arms. Dishonor
multiplies; they agree to conceal their love; Iseult marries Mark,
sleeps with Tris - tan, and plots to kill Brangane as knowing too much.
Mark is here (hardly in Malory) the only gentleman in the tale; he
discovers the deception, tells Iseult and Tristan that they are too dear
to him for revenge, and contents himself with exiling his nephew. In his
wanderings Tristan meets a third Iseult, and falls in love with her,
though he has sworn to be with Mark’s queen “one heart, o ne troth, one
body, one life.” Here Gottfried leaves the tale unfinished, and all the
ideals of chivalry shattered. The rest of the tale belongs to Malory and
a later age.</p>
<p>In this astonishing generation — the first of the thirteenth century
— Ger- many produced another poet who, with Walther, Wolfram, and
Gottfried, made a quartet unequaled elsewhere in the literature of
contemporary Chris- tendom. Hartmann von Aue began by lamely following
Chretien in the poetic romances Erec and lnjoein ; but when he turned to
the legends of his native Swabia he produced a minor masterpiece — Der
arme Heinrich ( c .</p>
<p>1205). “Poor Henry,” like Job, is a rich man who at the height of his
splen - dor is stricken with leprosy, which can only by cured (for
medieval magic must have a say) when some pure maiden freely dies for
him. Not expecting such a sacrifice, Henry abandons himself to
lamentation and despair. But lo and behold, such a maiden appears,
resolved to die that Heinrich may be healed. Her parents, thinking her
decision God-inspired, give their incred- ible consent, and the girl
bares her pretty bosom to the knife. But Heinrich suddenly becomes a
man, calls a halt, refuses the sacrifice, stops his moaning, and accepts
his pain as a divine visitation. Transformed in spirit by this new mood,
his bodily ills rapidly disappear, and his rescuer becomes his wife.
Hartmann redeemed the absurdity of the story with simple, flowing,
unpre- tentious verse, and Germany treasured the poem until our
unbelieving age.</p>
<p>A prettier tale was told, sometime in the first half of the
thirteenth</p>
<p>century, by an unknown Frenchman under the title Cest (TAucassin
et</p>
<p>IO5O THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Nicolette. Half romance, half laughing at romance, it was fittingly
phrased now in poetry now in prose, with music noted in the poetic
text.</p>
<p>Aucassin, son of the count of Beaucaire, falls in love with
Nicolette,</p>
<p>adoptive daughter of the viscount of Beaucaire. The count objects,
desiring to marry his son into some feudal family that can bring him aid
in war, and he bids his vassal viscount hide the girl. When Aucassin
tries to see her the viscount counsels him to “leave Nicolette alone, or
you will never see paradise.” To which Aucassin answers in a literary
correlate to the rising skepticism of the time.</p>
<p>In paradise what have I to do? I care not to enter it, but only to
have</p>
<p>Nicolette For into paradise go none but such people as aged
priests,</p>
<p>old cripples, and the maimed, who all day and night cough before
the</p>
<p>altars With them have I nought to do. But to hell will I go. For
to</p>
<p>hell go the fine scholars, and the fair knights who are slain in the
tour- ney or the great wars, and the stout archer, and the loyal man.
With them will I go. And there go the fair and courteous ladies, who
have friends — two or three — besides their wedded lord. And there pass
the . . . harpers and minstrels, and the kings of this world. With these
will I go so only that I have Nicolette, my very sweet friend, by my
side . 50</p>
<p>Nico lette’s father confines her to her room, and Aucassin’s father
im - prisons him in a cellar, where the lad sings of a strange and
charming cure:</p>
<p>Nicolette, white lily-flower,</p>
<p>Sweetest lady found in bower,</p>
<p>Sweet as grape that brimmeth up</p>
<p>Sweetness in the spiced cup,</p>
<p>On a day this chanced to you,</p>
<p>Out of Limousin there drew</p>
<p>One, a pilgrim, sore and dread,</p>
<p>Lay in pain upon his bed,</p>
<p>Tossed, and took with fear his breath,</p>
<p>Very dolent, near to death.</p>
<p>Then you entered, pure and white,</p>
<p>Softly t o the sick man’s sight</p>

<p>Then a wondrous thing befell,</p>
<p>Straight he rose up sound and well,</p>
<p>Left his bed, took cross in hand,</p>
<p>Sought again his own dear land.</p>
<p>Lily-flower, so white, so sweet,</p>
<p>Fair the faring of thy feet,</p>
<p>Fair thy laughter, fair thy speech,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVI II)</p>
<p>THE AGE OF ROMANCE</p>
<p>IO5I</p>
<p>Fair our playing each with each.</p>
<p>Sweet thy kisses, soft thy touch,</p>
<p>All must love thee overmuch. 51</p>
<p>Meanwhile the lily-flower makes a rope of her bed sheets, and lets
herself down into the garden.</p>
<p>Then she took her skirt in both hands . . . and kilted her
lightly</p>
<p>against the dew which lay thickly on the grass, and so she passed</p>
<p>through the garden. Her hair was golden, with little love-locks;
her</p>
<p>eyes blue and laughing; her face most dainty to see, with lips
more</p>
<p>vermeil than ever rose or cherry in summer heat; her teeth white and
small; her breasts so firm that they showed beneath her vesture like two
rounded nuts. So frail was she about the girdle that your two</p>
<p>hands could have spanned her; and the daisies that she brake with her
feet in passing showed altogether black against her instep and her
flesh, so white was the fair young maid. 52</p>
<p>She finds her way to a barred window of Aucassin’s cell, cuts a tress
of her hair, slips it to him, and swears that her love is as great as
his. Her father sends searchers for her; she flees into the woods, and
lives with apprecia- tive shepherds. After some time Aucassin’s father,
thinking her safely out of sight, frees him. Aucassin takes to the woods
and hunts for her through half- comic vicissitudes. He finds her, sets
her before him on his horse, “kiss - ing her as they rode.” To escape
their pursuing parents they take ship across the Mediterranean; they
come to a land where men give birth and wars are fought by jolly
pummeling with fruit. They are captured by less amiable warriors, are
separated for three years, but at last are made one again. The irate
parents kindly die, and Aucassin and Nicolette become the Count and
Countess of Beaucaire. There is nothing more exquisite in all the rich
litera- ture of France.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE SATIRICAL REACTION</li>
</ol>
<p>The humorous interludes of this story suggest that the French were
be- ginning to feel a surfeit of romance. The most famous poem of the
Middle Ages — far more widely known and read than The Divine Comedy —
began as a romance and ended as one of the heartiest, bluntest satires
in history. About 1237 Guillaume de Lorris, a young scholar of Orleans,
composed an allegorical poem which was designed to enclose the whole art
of courtly love, and to be, through its very abstractions, a model and
summary of all amorous romance. We know nothing of William of the Loire
except that he wrote the first 4266 lines of the Roman de la rose. He
pictures himself wandering in a dream into a gorgeous Garden of Love,
where every known flower blooms and all birds sing, and happy couples,
personifying the joys</p>
<p>IO52 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>and graces of the gallant life — Mirth, Gladness, Courtesy, Beauty .
. . — dance under the presidency of the God of Love; here is a new
religion, with a new conception of paradise, in which woman replaces
God. Within this gar- den the dreamer sees a rose lovelier than all the
beauty that surrounds it, but guarded by a thousand thorns. It is the
symbol of the Beloved; and the hero’s longing to reach and pluck it
becomes an allegory of all the amorous cam- paigns ever waged by checked
desire feeding imagination. No human being but the narrator enters the
tale; all the other actors are personifications of the qualities of
character to be found at any court where women are pur- sued by men:
Fair-Seeming, Pride, Villainy, Shame, Wealth, Avarice, Envy, Sloth,
Hypocrisy, Youth, Despair, even “NewThought”— which here means
inconstancy. The marvel of it is that with these abstractions Guillaume
managed to make interesting verse — perhaps because at any age and in
any guise love is as interesting as the blood is warm.*</p>
<p>William died prematurely, leaving his poem unfinished; and for forty
years the world had to wonder if the Lover, shot by Cupid and shivering
with love, had ever done more than kiss the Rose. Then another
Frenchman, Jean de Meung, took up the torch, and carried it to over
22,000 lines, in a poem as different from William’s as Rabelais from
Tennyson. The lapse of a gen - eration had changed the mood; romance had
talked itself out for a while; philosophy was casting the pall of reason
over the poetry of faith; the Cru- sades had failed; the age of doubt
and satire had begun. Some say that Jean wrote his boisterous
continuation at the suggestion of the same King Philip IV who would send
his skeptical lawyers to laugh in the face of the Pope. Jean Clopinel
was born at Meung on the Loire about 1250, studied philos- ophy and
literature at Paris, and became one of the most learned men of his time.
We know not what imp of the perverse led him to put his learning, his
anticlericalism, his contempt of woman and romance, into a continuation
of the most romantic poem in all literature. In the same eight-syllabled
lines and rhyming couplets as William’s, but with a verve and vivacity
all the world away from William’s dreamy verse, Jean airs his views on
all topics from the Creation to the Last Judgment, while his poor lover
waits in the garden, all this time longing for the Rose. If Jean has any
romance left in him it is Plato’s fancy of a Golden Age in the past,
when “no man called this or that his own, and lust and rapine were
unknown”; when there were</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaucer’s translation — The Romaunt of the Rose — of the first half
of William’s poem is as fine as the original.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE AGE OF ROMANCE IO53</p>
<p>crocodile tears. 55 He admits that a “gracious woman’s love” is
life’s best boon, but apparently he has not known it. 56 Perhaps he did
not deserve it; satire never won fair maiden; and Jean, too schooled in
Ovid, thought and taught more of using women than of loving them.
Monogamy is absurd, he says; nature intended toutes pour touz — all
women for all men. He makes a sated husband chide a primping wife:</p>
<p>What comes of all this bravery?</p>
<p>What benefit accrues to me</p>
<p>From costly gowns and quaint-cut gear,</p>
<p>Your flirting tricks and mincing cheer?</p>
<p>What for these orphreys do I care</p>
<p>With which you twist and bind your hair,</p>
<p>Entwined with threads of gold? And why</p>
<p>Must you have set in ivory</p>
<p>Enameled mirrors, sprinkled o’er</p>
<p>With golden circlets? . . . Why these gems</p>
<p>Befitting kingly diadems? —</p>
<p>Rubies and pearls, and sapphires fair,</p>
<p>Which cause you to assume an air</p>
<p>Of mad conceit? These costly stuffs,</p>
<p>And plaited furbelows and ruffs,</p>
<p>And cinctures to set off your waist,</p>
<p>With pearls bedecked and richly chased?</p>
<p>And wherefore, say, then, do you choose</p>
<p>To fit your feet with gaudy shoes</p>
<p>Except you have a lust to show</p>
<p>Your shapely legs? By St. Thibaud,</p>
<p>Ere yet three days are past I’ll sell</p>
<p>This trash, and trample you pell-mell! 57</p>
<p>It is some consolation to learn that in the end the God of Love, at
the head of his innumerable vassals, storms the tower where Danger,
Shame, and Fear (the lady’s hesitations) guard the Rose, and Welcome
admits the Lover to the inner shrine, and lets him pluck the image of
his dreams. But how can this long-deferred romantic termination wipe out
1 8,000 lines of peasant real- ism and goliardic ribaldry?</p>
<p>The three most widely read books in the Western Europe of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries were the Romance of the Rose, the Golden Legend
, and Reynard the Fox . Reynard began his Latin career as Ysengrinus
about 1150, and passed into various vernaculars as Roman de Renart,
Reynard the Fox , Reineke de Vos, Reinaert, finally as Goethe’s Reinecke
Fu chs. Divers authors contributed some thirty merry tales to the cycle
until it totaled 24,000 lines, nearly all devoted to satirizing feudal
forms, royal courts, Chris- tian ceremonies, and human frailties through
animal analogies.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO54</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>Renart the fox plays impish tricks on Noble the lion, king of the
realm. He scents Noble’s amour with Dame Harouge the leopardess, and by
in - trigues worthy of Talleyrand he persuades her to play mistress to
himself. He propitiates Noble and other beasts by giving each a talisman
that tells a husband of his wife’s infidelities. Dreadful revelations
ensue; the husbands beat their guilty wives, who flee for refuge to
Renart, who gathers them into a harem. In one tale the animals engage in
a tournament, in solemn knightly regalia and parade. In La Mort Renart
the old fox is dying; Bernard the ass, archbishop of the court, comes to
administer the sacraments to him with extreme unction and gravity.
Renart confesses his sins, but stipulates that if he recovers his oath
of reform is to be held null and void. To all appearances he dies, and
the many beasts whom he has cuckolded, beaten, plucked, or cozened
gather to mourn him with happy hypocrisy. The archbishop preaches a
Rabelaisian sermon over the grave, and reproaches Renart for having
considered “anything in season if you could get hold of it.” But when
holy water is sprinkled upon him Renart revives, catches Chantecler (who
is swinging the censer) by the neck, and bolts into a thicket with his
prey. To understand the Middle Ages one must never forget Renart.</p>
<p>The Roman de Renart was the greatest of the fabliaux. A fabliau was a
fable of animals satirizing man, usually in octosyllabic verse running
from thirty to a thousand lines. Some were as old as Aesop or older;
some came from India through Islam. Mostly they lampooned women and
priests, re- senting the natural powers of the one class and the
supernatural powers of the other; besides, ladies and priests had
condemned the minstrels for reciting scandalous fabliaux. For the
fabliaux were directed to strong stomachs; they appropriated the
terminology of taverns and brothels, and gave meter to unmeasured
pleasantries. But from their stews Chaucer, Boccaccio, Ariosto, La
Fontaine, and a hundred other raconteurs brewed many a startling
tale.</p>
<p>The rise of satire lowered the status of minstrelsy. The traveling
singers derived their English name from the ministeriales, originally
attendants in baronial courts, and their French name of jongleurs from
the Latin io culator, a purveyor of jokes. They filled the functions,
and continued the lineage, of Greek rhapsodes, Roman mimes, Scandinavian
scalds, Anglo-Saxon glee- men, and Welsh or Irish bards. In the
twelfth-century heyday of the ro- mances the minstrels took the place of
printing, and kept their dignity by purveying stories occasionally
worthy to be classed as literature. Harp or viol in hand, they recited
lays, dits or contes (short stories) , epics, legends of Mary or the
saints, chansons de geste, romans, or fabliaux. In Lent, when they were
not in demand, they attended, if they could, a confrerie of min- strels
and jongleurs like that which we know to have been held at Fecamp in
Normandy about the yea r 1000; there they learned one another’s tricks
and airs, and the new tales or songs of trouveres and troubadours. Many
of them were willing, if their recitations proved too much of an

<p>strain for their audiences, to entertain them with juggling,
tumbling, con- tortions, and rope walking. When the trouveres went about
reciting their own stories, and when the habit of reading spread and
reduced the demand for reciters, the minstrel became more and more of a
vaudevillian, so that the jongleur became a juggler; he tossed knives,
pulled Punch and Judy puppets, or displayed the repertoire of trained
bears, apes, horses, cocks, dogs, camels, and lions. Some of the
minstrels turned fabliaux into farces, and acted them without skimping
the obscenities. The Church more and more frowned upon them, and forbade
the pious to listen to them, or the kings to feed them; and Bishop
Honorius of Autun was of the opinion that no minstrel would be admitted
to paradise.</p>

students of the universities, received Jean de Meung’s epic of the
