<p>XBabylonia</p>
<p>I. FROM HAMMURABI TO NEBUCHADREZZAR</p>
<p>Babylonian contributions to modem civilization — The Land be-</p>
<p>tween the Rivers — Hammurabi — His capital — The Kassite</p>
<p>Domination — The Amarna letters — The Assyrian Con-</p>
<p>quest — N ebuchadrezzar — Babylon in the days of</p>
<p>its glory</p>
<p>C IVILIZATION, like life, is a perpetual struggle with death. And
as</p>
<p>life maintains itself only by abandoning old, and recasting itself
in</p>
<p>younger and fresher, forms, so civilization achieves a precarious
survival by changing its habitat or its blood. It moved from Ur to
Babylon and Judea, from Babylon to Nineveh, from these to Persepolis,
Sardis and Miletus, and from these, Egypt and Crete to Greece and
Rome.</p>
<p>No one looking at the site of ancient Babylon today would suspect
that these hot and dreary wastes along the Euphrates were once the rich
and powerful capital of a civilization that almost created astronomy,
added richly to the progress of medicine, established the science of
language, prepared the first great codes of law, taught the Greeks the
rudiments of mathematics, physics and philosophy, 1 gave the Jews the
mythology which they gave to the world, and passed on to the Arabs part
of that scientific and architectural lore with which they aroused the
dormant soul of medie- val Europe. Standing before the silent Tigris and
Euphrates one finds it hard to believe that they are the same rivers
that watered Sumeria and Akkad, and nourished the Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.</p>
<p>In some ways they are not the same rivers: not only because “one
never steps twice into the same stream,” but because these old rivers
have long since remade their beds along new courses, 2 and “mow with
their scythes of whiteness” 8 other shores. As in Egypt the Nile, so
here the Tigris and the Euphrates provided, for thousands of miles, an
avenue of commerce and — in their southern reaches — springtime
inundations that helped the peasant to fertilize his soil. For rain
comes to Babylonia only in the winter</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>months; from May to November it comes not at all; and the earth, but
for the overflow of the rivers, would be as arid as northern Mesopotamia
was then and is today. Through the abundance of the rivers and the toil
of many generations of men, Babylonia became the Eden of Semitic legend,
the garden and granary of western Asia. #</p>
<p>Historically and ethnically Babylonia was a product of the union of
the Akkadians and the Sumerians. Their mating generated the Babylonian
type, in which the Akkadian Semitic strain proved dominant; their
warfare ended in the triumph of Akkad, and the establishment of Babylon
as the capital of all lower Mesopotamia. At the outset of this history
stands the powerful figure of Hammurabi (2123-2081 b.c.) conqueror and
law- giver through a reign of forty-three years. Primeval seals and
inscriptions transmit him to us partially — a youth full of fire and
genius, a very whirl- wind in battle, who crushes all rebels, cuts his
enemies into pieces, marches over inaccessible mountains, and never
loses an engagement. Under him the petty warring states of the lower
valley were forced into unity and peace, and disciplined into order and
security by an historic code of laws.</p>
<p>The Code of Hammurabi was unearthed at Susa in 1902, beautifully
engraved upon a diorite cylinder that had been carried from Babylon to
Elam (ca. 1100 b.c.) as a trophy of war.f Like that of Moses, this
legis- lation was a gift from Heaven, for one side of the cylinder shows
the Kang receiving the laws from Sham ash, the Sun-god himself. The
Prologue is almost in Heaven:</p>
<p>When the lofty Anu, King of the Anunaki and Bel, Lord of</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth, he who determines the destiny of the land,</p>
<p>committed the rule of all mankind to Marduk; . . . when they</p>
<p>pronounced the lofty name of Babylon; when they made it famous</p>
<p>among the quarters of the world and in its midst established an</p>
<p>everlasting kingdom whose foundations were firm as heaven and</p>
<p>earth — at that time Anu and Bel called me, Hammurabi, the ex-</p>
<p>alted prince, the worshiper of the gods, to cause justice to
prevail</p>
<p>in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil, to prevent the</p>
<p>strong from oppressing the weak, … to enlighten the land and to</p>
<p>further the welfare of the people. Hammurabi, the governor named by
Bel, am I, who brought about plenty and abundance; who made</p>
<ul>

(ii, 14), flowed through Paradise,</li>

to</p>
<p>the city of Uruk; who supplied water in abundance to its inhabi-</p>
<p>tants; . . . who made the city of Borsippa beautiful; . . . who

<p>The words here arbitrarily underlined have a modern ring; one would
not readily attribute them to an Oriental “despot” 2100 b.c., or suspect
that the laws that they introduce were based upon Sumerian prototypes
now six thousand years old. This ancient origin combined with Baby-
lonian circumstance to give the Code a composite and heterogeneous char-
acter. It begins with compliments to the gods, but takes no further
notice of them in its astonishingly secular legislation. It mingles the
most enlight- ened laws with the most barbarous punishments, and sets
the primitive lex talionis and trial by ordeal alongside elaborate
judicial procedures and a discriminating attempt to limit marital
tyranny. 5 All in all, these 285 laws, arranged almost scientifically
under the headings of Personal Prop- erty, Real Estate, Trade and
Business, the Family, Injuries, and Labor, form a code more advanced and
civilized than that of Assyria a thousand and more years later, and in
many respects “as good as that of a modern European state.” 0 * There
are few words finer in the history of law than those with which the
great Babylonian brings his legislation to a close:</p>
<p>The righteous laws which Hammurabi, the wise king, estab-</p>
<p>lished, and (by which) he gave the land stable support and pure</p>
<p>government. … I am the guardian governor. … In my bosom I</p>
<p>carried the people of the land of Sumer and Akkad; … in my wis-</p>
<p>dom I restrained them, that the strong might not oppress the weak,
and that they should give justice to the orphan and the widow.</p>
<p>. . . Let any oppressed man, who has a cause, come before my</p>
<p>image as king of righteousness! Let him read the inscription on
my</p>
<p>monument! Let him give heed to my weighty words! And may</p>
<p>my monument enlighten him as to his cause, and may he under-</p>
<p>stand his case! May he set his heart at ease, (exclaiming:) “Ham

<p>ftiurabi indeed is a ruler who is like a real father to his
people;</p>
<p>… he has established prosperity for his people for all time, and</p>
<p>given a pure government to the land.” . . .</p>
<p>In the days that are yet to come, for all future time, may the</p>
<p>king who is in the land observe the words of righteousness which
I</p>
<p>have written upon my monument ! 8</p>
<p>This unifying legislation was but one of Hammurabi’s accomplishments.
At his command a great canal was dug between Kish and the Persian Gulf,
thereby irrigating a large area of land, and protecting the cities of
the south from the destructive floods which the Tigris had been wont to
visit upon them. In another inscription which has found ;ts devious way
from his time to ours he tells us proudly how he gave water (that noble
and unap- preciated commonplace, which was once a luxury), security and
gov- ernment to many tribes. Even through the boasting (an honest
mannerism of the Orient) we hear the voice of statesmanship.</p>
<p>When Anu and Enlil (the gods of Uruk and Nippur) gave me</p>
<p>the lands of Sumer and Akkad to rule, and they entrusted this</p>
<p>sceptre to me, I dug the canal Hammurabi-nukhush-nisht (Ham-</p>
<p>murabi- the- Abundance -of- the -People), which bringeth copious</p>
<p>water to the land of Sumer and Akkad. Its banks on both sides I</p>
<p>turned into cultivated ground; I heaped up piles of grain, I pro-</p>
<p>vided unfailing water for the lands. . . . The scattered people I</p>
<p>gathered; with pasturage and water I provided them; I pastured</p>
<p>them with abundance, and settled them in peaceful dwellings.®</p>
<p>Despite the secular quality of his laws Hammurabi was clever enough
to gild his authority with the approval of the gods. He built temples as
well as forts, and coddled the clergy by constructing at Babylon a
gigantic sanctuary for Marduk and his wife (the national deities), and a
massive granary to store up wheat for gods and priests. These and
similar gifts were an astute investment, from which he expected steady
returns in the awed obedience of the people. From their taxes he
financed the forces of law and order, and had enough left over to
beautify his capital. Palaces and temples rose on every hand; a bridge
spanned the Euphrates to let the city spread itself along both banks;
ships manned with ninety men plied up</p>
<p>222 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. E</p>
<p>Xand down the river. Two thousand years before Christ Babylon was</p>
<p>already one of the richest cities that history had yet known.*</p>
<p>The people were of Semitic appearance, dark in hair and features,
mas- culinely bearded for the most part, and occasionally bewigged. Both
sexes wore the hair long; sometimes even the men dangled curls;
frequently the men, as well as the women, disguised themselves with
perfumes. The common dress for both sexes was a white linen tunic
reaching to the feet; in the women it left one shoulder bare, in the men
it was augmented with mantle and robe. As wealth grew, the people
developed a taste for color, and dyed for themselves garments of blue on
red, or red on blue, in stripes, circles, checks or dots. The bare feet
of the Sumerian period gave way to shapely sandals, and the male head,
in Hammurabi’s time, was swathed in turbans. The women wore necklaces,
bracelets and amulets, and strings of beads in their carefully coiffured
hair; the men flourished walking-sticks with carved heads, and carried
on their girdles the prettily designed seals with which they attested
their letters and documents. The priests wore tall conical caps to
conceal their humanity.”</p>
<p>It is almost a law of history that the same wealth that generates a
civili- zation announces its decay. For wealth produces ease as well as
art; it softens a people to the ways of luxury and peace, and invites
invasion from stronger arms and hungrier mouths. On the eastern boundary
of the new state a hardy tribe of mountaineers, the Kassites, looked
with envy upon the riches of Babylon. Eight years after Hammurabi’s
death they inun - dated the land, plundered it, retreated, raided it
again and again, and finally settled down in it as conquerors and
rulers; this is the normal origin of aristocracies. They were of
non-Semitic stock, perhaps descend- ants of European immigrants from
neolithic days; their victory over Sem- itic Babylon represented one
more swing of the racial pendulum in west- ern Asia. For several
centuries Babylonia lived in an ethnic and political chaos that put a
stop to the development of science and art. 11 We have a kaleidoscope of
this stifling disorder in the “Amarna” letters, in which the kinglets of
Babylonia and Syria, having sent modest tribute to im- perial Egypt
after the victories of Thutmose III, beg for aid against rebels and
invaders, and quarrel about the value of the gifts that they
exchange</p>

<li>“In all essentials Babylonia, in the time of Hammurabi, and even
earlier, had reached a pitch of material civilization which has never
since been surpassed in Asia.”— Christopher Dawson, Enquiries into
Religion and Culture, New York, 1933, p. 107. Perhaps we should except
the ages of Xerxes I in Persia, Ming Huang in China, and Akbar in
India.</li>

<p>with the disdainful Amenhotep III and the absorbed and negligent</p>
<p>Ikhnaton.*</p>
<p>The Kassites were expelled after almost six centuries of rule as
disruptive as the similar sway of the Hyksos in Egypt. The disorder
continued for four hundred years more under obscure Babylonian rulers,
whose poly- syllabic roster might serve as an obbligato to Gray’s Elegy
, f until the rising power of Assyria in the north stretched down its
hand and brought Babylonia under the kings of Nineveh. When Babylon
rebelled, Sennach- erib destroyed it almost completely; but the genial
despotism of Esar- haddon restored it to prosperity and culture. The
rise of the Medes</p>
<p>weakened Assyria, and with their help Nabopolassar liberated
Babylonia, set up an independent dynasty, and dying, bequeathed this
second Baby- lonian kingdom to his son Nebuchadrezzar II, villain of the
vengeful</p>
<p>and legendary Book of D aniel .” Nebuchadrezzar’s inaugural address
to Marduk, god-in-chief of Babylon, reveals a glimpse of an Oriental
mon- arch’s aims and character:</p>
<p>As my precious life do I love thy sublime appearance! Outside</p>
<p>of my city Babylon, I have not selected among all settlements any</p>
<p>dwelling. … At thy command, O merciful Marduk, may the house</p>
<p>that I have built endure forever, may I be satiated with its
splendor, attain old age therein, with abundant offspring, and receive
therein tribute of the kings of all regions, from all mankind . 14</p>
<p>He lived almost up to his hopes, for though illiterate and not
unques- tionably sane, he became the most powerful ruler of his time in
the Near East, and the greatest warrior, statesman and builder in all
the suc- cession of Babylonian kings after Hammurabi himself. When
Egypt</p>
<p>conspired with Assyria to reduce Babylonia to vassalage again,
Nebuchad-</p>
<ul>
<li>The Amarna letters are dreary reading, full of adulation, argument,
entreaty and com- plaint. Hear, e.g., Burraburiash II, King of
Karduniash (in Mesopotamia), writing to Amenhotep III about an exchange
of royal gifts in which Burraburiash seems to have been worsted: “Ever
since my mother and thy father sustained friendly relations with

names, linked with such hyphens, would make a like cacophony to alien
ears.</p>
<p>224 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xrezzar met the Egyptian hosts at Carchemish (on the upper reaches of
the Euphrates), and almost annihilated them. Palestine and Syria then
fell easily under his sway, and Babylonian merchants controlled all the
trade that flowed across western Asia from the Persian Gulf to the
Mediterran- ean Sea.</p>
<p>Nebuchadrezzar spent the tolls of this trade, the tributes of these
sub- jects, and the taxes of his people, in beautifying his capital and
assuaging the hunger of the priests. “Is not this the great Babylon that
I built?” 16 He resisted the temptation to be merely a conqueror; he
sallied forth occa- sionally to teach his subjects the virtues of
submission, but for the most part he stayed at home, making Babylon the
unrivaled capital of the Near East, the largest and most magnificent
metropolis of the ancient world. 16 Nabopolassar had laid plans for the
reconstruction of the city; Nebuchad- rezzar used his long reign of
forty-three years to carry them to comple- tion. Herodotus, who saw
Babylon a century and a half later, described it as “standing in a
spacious plain,” and surrounded by a wall fifty -six miles in length, 17
so broad that a four-horse chariot could be driven along the top, and
enclosing an area of some two hundred square miles. 16 * Through the
center of the town ran the palm-fringed Euphrates, busy with commerce
and spanned by a handsome bridge.“t Practically all the better buildings
were of brick, for stone was rare in Mesopotamia; but the bricks were
often faced with enameled tiles of brilliant blue, yellow or white,
adorned with animal and other figures in glazed relief, which remain to
this day supreme in their kind. Nearly all the bricks so far recovered
fr om the site of Babylon bear the proud inscription: “I am Nebuchad -
rezzar, King of Babylon.” 21</p>
<p>Approaching the city the traveler saw first — at the crown of a
very</p>
<p>mountain of masonry — an immense and lofty ziggurat, rising in seven
stages of gleaming enamel to a height of 650 feet, crowned with a shrine
con- taining a massive table of solid gold, and an ornate bed on which,
each night, some woman slept to await the pleasure of the god. 22 This
structure, taller than the pyramids of Egypt, and surpassing in height
all but the latest of modern buildings, was probably the “Tower of
Babel” of He - braic myth, the many-storied audacity of a people who did
not know</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably this included not only the city proper but a large
agricultural hinterland within the walls, designed to provide the
teeming metropolis with sustenance in time of siege.</li>
</ul>
<p>t If we may trust Diodorus Siculus, a tunnel fifteen feet wide and
twelve feet high con- nected the two banks . 20</p>

<p>CHAP. ix)</p>
<p>Yahveh, and whom the God of Hosts was supposed to have confounded
with a multiplicity of tongues.* South of the ziggurat stood the
gigantic Temple of Marduk, tutelary deity of Babylon. Around and below
this temple the city spread itself out in a few wide and brilliant
avenues, crossed by crowded canals and narrow winding streets alive, no
doubt, with traffic and bazaars, and Orientally odorous with garbage and
humanity. Con- necting the temples was a spacious “Sacred Way,” paved
with asphalt - covered bricks overlaid with flags of limestone and red
breccia-, over this the gods might pass without muddying their feet.
This broad avenue was flanked with walls of colored tile, on which stood
out, in low relief, one hundred and twenty brightly enameled lions,
snarling to keep the impious away. At one end of the Sacred Way rose the
magnificent</p>
<p>Ishtar Gate, a massive double portal of resplendent tiles, adorned
with enameled flowers and animals of admirable color, vitality, and
line.f</p>
<p>Six hundred yards north of the “Tower of Babel” rose a mound called
Kasr, on which Nebuchadrezzar built the most imposing of his palaces. At
its center stood his principal dwelling-place, the walls of finely made
yellow brick, the floors of white and mottled sandstone; reliefs of
vivid blue glaze adorned the surfaces, and gigantic basalt lions guarded
the entrance. Nearby, supported on a succession of superimposed circular
colonnades, were the famous Hanging Gardens, which the Greeks in- cluded
among the Seven Wonders of the World. The gallant Nebuchad- rezzar had
built them for one of his wives, the daughter of Cyaxares, King of the
Medes; this princess, unaccustomed to the hot sun and dust of Babylon,
pined for the verdure of her native hills. The topmost terrace was
covered with rich soil to the depth of many feet, providing space and
nourishment not merely for varied flowers and plants, but for the
largest and most deep-rooted trees. Hydraulic engines concealed in the
columns and manned by shifts of slaves carried water from the Euphrates
to the highest tier of the gardens.“ Here, seventy-five feet above the
ground, in the cool shade of tall trees, and surrounded, by exotic
shrubs and fragrant flowers, the ladies of the royal harem walked
unveiled, secure from the common eye; while, in the plains and streets
below, the common man and woman ploughed, wove, built, carried burdens,
and reproduced their kind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Babel, however, does not mean confusion or babble, as the legend
supposes; as used in the word Babylon it meant the Gate of God . 23</li>

<p>fA reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate can be seen in the
Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin.</p>

<p>Part of the country was still wild and dangerous; snakes wandered in
the thick grass, and the kings of Babylonia and Assyria made it their
royal sport to hunt in hand-to-hand conflict the lions that prowled in
the woods, posed placidly for artists, but fled timidly at the nearer
approach of men. Civilization is an occasional and temporary
interruption of the jungle.</p>
<p>Most of the soil was tilled by tenants or by slaves; some of it by
peasant proprietors. 20 In the earlier centuries the ground was broken
up with stone hoes, as in neolithic tillage; a seal dating some 1400
b.c. is our earliest representation of the plough in Babylonia. Probaby
this ancient and hon-* orable tool had already a long history behind it
in the Land between the Rivers; and yet it was modern enough, for though
it was drawn by oxen in the manner of our fathers, it had, attached to
the plough, as in Sumeria, a tube through which the seed was sown in the
manner of our children. 26 The waters of the rising rivers were not
allowed to flood the land as in Egypt; on the contrary, every farm was
protected from the inundation by ridges of earth, some of which can
still be seen today. The overflow was guided into a complex network of
canals, or stored into reservoirs, from which it was sluiced into the
fields as needed, or raised over the ridges by shadufs — buckets lifted
and lowered on a pivoted and revolving pole. Neb- uchadrezzar
distinguished his reign by building many canals, and gather- ing the
surplus waters of the overflow into a reservoir, one hundred and forty
miles in circumference, which nourished by its outlets vast areas of
land. 27 Ruins of these canals can be seen in Mesopotamia today, and —
as if further to bind the quick and the dead — the primitive shaduf is
still in use in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Loire. 28</p>
<p>So watered, the land produced a variety of cereals and pulses, great
orchards of fruits and nuts, and above all, the date; from this
beneficent concoction of sun and soil the Babylonians made bread, honey,
cake and other delica- cies; they mixed it with meal to make one of
their most sustaining foods; and to encourage its reproduction they
shook the flowers of the male palm over those of the female. 29 From
Mesopotamia the grape and the olive were introduced into Greece and Rome
and thence into western Europe; from nearby Persia came the peach; and
from the shores of the Black Sea Lucullus brought the cherry-tree to
Rome. Milk, so rare in the distant Orient, now became one of the staple
foods of the Near East. Meat was rare and costly, but fish from the
great streams found their way into the</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>poorest mouths. And in the evening, when the peasant might have been
dis- turbed by thoughts qn life and death, he quieted memory and
anticipation with wine pressed from the date, or beer brewed from the
com.</p>
<p>Meanwhile others pried into the earth, struck oil, and mined copper,
lead, iron, silver and gold. Strabo tells how what he calls “naphtha or
liquid as - phalt” was taken from the soil of Mesopotamia then as now,
and how Alex - ander, hearing that this was a kind of water that burned,
tested the report incredulously by covering a boy with the strange fluid
and igniting him with a torch . 80 Tools, which had still been of stone
in the days of Ham- murabi, began, at the turn of the last millennium
before Christ# to be made of bronze, then of iron; and the art of
casting metal appeared. Textiles were woven of cotton and wool; stuffs
were dyed and embroidered with such skill that these tissues became one
of the most valued exports of Babylonia, praised to the skies by the
writers of Greece and Rome . 81 As far back as we can go in Mesopotamian
history we find the weaver’s loom and the potter’s wheel; these were
almost the only machines. Buildings were mostly of adobe — clay mixed
with straw; or bricks still soft and moist were placed one upon the
other and allowed to dry into a solid wall cemented by the sun. It was
observed that the bricks in the fireplace became harder and more durable
than those that the sun had baked; the process of hardening them in
kilns was then a natural development, and thenceforth there was no end
to the making of bricks in Babylon. Trades multiplied and became
diversified and skilled, and as early as Hammurabi industry was
organized into guilds (called “tribes”) of masters and apprentices .
33</p>
<p>Local transport used wheeled carts drawn by patient asses . 83 The
horse is first men tioned in Babylonian records about 2100 b . c ., as
“the ass from the East”; apparently it came from the table -lands of
Central Asia, conquered Babylonia with the ’Kassites, and reached Egypt
with the Hyksos . 84 With this new means of locomotion and carriage,
trade expanded from local to foreign commerce; Babylon grew wealthy as
the commercial hub of the Near East, and the nations of the ancient
Mediterranean world were drawn into closer contact for good and
ill. Nebuchadrezzar facilitated trade by im- proving the highways; “I
have turned inaccessible tracks,” he reminds the historian, “into
serviceable roads .” 36 Countless caravans brought to the ba - zaars and
shops of Babylon the products of half the world. From India they came
via Kabul, Herat and Ecbatana; from Egypt via Pelusium and Palestine;
from Asia Minor through Tyre, Sidon and Sardis to Carchemish, and then
down the Euphrates. As a result of all this trade Babylon became, under
Nebuchadrezzar, a thriving and noisy market-place, from which the
wealthy sought refuge in residential suburbs. Note the contemporary ring
of a rich suburbanite’s letter to King Cyrus of Persia (ca. 539 b . c
.): “Our</p>
<p>228 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xestate seemed to me the finest in the world, for it was so near to
Babylon that we enjoyed all the advantages of a great city, and yet
could come back home and be rid of all its rush and worry.” 30</p>
<p>Government in Mesopotamia never succeeded in establishing such eco-
nomic order as that which the Pharaohs achieved in Egypt. Commerce was
harassed with a multiplicity of dangers and tolls; the merchant did not
know which to fear the more — the robbers that might beset him on the
way, or the towns and baronies that exacted heavy fees from him for the
privilege of using their roads. It was safer, where possible, to take
the great national highway, the Euphrates, which Nebuchadrezzar had made
navigable from the Persian Gulf to Thapsacus. 37 His campaigns in Arabia
and his subjuga- tion of Tyre opened up to Babylonian commerce the
Indian and Mediterra- nean Seas, but these opportunities were only
partially explored. For on the open sea, as in the mountain passes and
the desert wastes, perils beset the merchant at every hour. Vessels were
large, but reefs were many and treacherous; navigation was not yet a
science; and at any moment pirates, or the ambitious dwellers on the
shore, might board the ships, appropriate the merchandise, and enslave
or kill the crew. 38 The merchants reimbursed themselves for such losses
by restricting their honesty to the necessities of each situation.</p>
<p>These difficult transactions were made easier by a well-developed
system of finance. The Babylonians had no coinage, but even before
Ham-</p>
<p>murabi they used — besides barley and corn — ingots of gold and
silver as standards of value and mediums of exchange. The metal was
unstamped, and was weighed at each transaction. The smallest unit of
currency was the shekel — a half-ounce of silver worth from .50 to .00
of our con- temporary currency; sixty such shekels made a mina&gt; and
sixty minus made a talent — from 0,000 to izo^oo. 38 * Loans were made
in goods or currency, but at a high rate of interest, fixed by the state
at 20per per annum for loans of money, and 33per for loans in kind; even
these rates were exceeded by lenders who could hire clever scribes to
circumvent the law. 30 There were no banks, but certain powerful
families carried on from generation to generation the business of
lending money; they dealt also in real estate, and financed indus- trial
enterprises; 40 and persons who had funds on deposit with such men could
pay their obligations by written drafts. 41 The priests also made loans,
particu- larly to finance the sowing and reaping of the crops. The law
occasionally took the side of the debtor: e.g., if a peasant mortgaged
his farm, and through storm or drought or other “act of God” had no
harvest from his toil, then no in - terest could be exacted from him in
that year. 43 But for the most part the law was written with an eye to
protecting property and preventing losses;</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>it was a principle of Babylonian law that no man had a right to
borrow money unless he wished to be held completely responsible for its
repay- ment; hence the creditor could seize the debtor’s slave or son as
hostage for an unpaid debt, and could hold him for not more than three
years. A plague of usury was the price that Babylonian industry, like
our own, paid for the fertilizing activity of a complex credit system.
43</p>
<p>It was essentially a commercial civilization. Most of the documents
that have come down from it are of a business character — sales, loans,
contracts, partnerships, commissions, exchanges, bequests, agreements,
promissory notes, and the like. We find in these tablets abundant
evidence of wealth, and a certain materialistic spirit that managed,
like some later civilizations, to re- concile piety with greed. We see
in the literature many signs of a busy and prosperous life, but we find
also, at every turn, reminders of the slavery that underlies all
cultures. The most interesting contracts of sale from the age of
Nebuchadrezzar are those that have to do with slaves. 44 They were
recruited frqm captives taken in battle, from slave-raids carried out
upon foreign states by marauding Bedouins, and from the reproductive
enthusiasm of the slaves themselves. Their value ranged from 0 to 5 for
a woman, and from 0 to 00 for a man. 43 Most of the physical work in the
towns was done by them, including nearly all of the personal service.
Female slaves were completely at the mercy of their purchaser, and were
expected to pro- vide him with bed as well as board; it was understood
that he would breed through them a copious supply of children, and those
slaves who were not so treated felt themselves neglected and dishonored.
46 The slave and all his belongings were his master’s property: he might
be sold or pledged for debt; he might be put to death if his master
thought him less lucrative alive than dead; if he ran away no one could
legally harbor him, and a reward was fixed for his capture. Like the
free peasant he was subject to conscription for both the army and the
corvee — i.e., for forced labor in such public works as cutting roads
and digging canals. On the other hand the slave’s master paid his
doctor’s fees, and kept him moderately alive through illness, slack
employment and old age. He might marry a free woman, and his children by
her would be free; half his property, in such a case, went on his death
to his family. He might be set up in business by his master, and re-
tain part of the profits — with which he might then buy his freedom; or
his master might liberate him for exceptional or long and faithful
service. But only a few slaves achieved such freedom. The rest consoled
themselves with a high birth-rate, until they became more numerous than
the free. A great slave-class moved like a swelling subterranean river
underneath the Babylonian state.</p>

<li>THE LAW</li>

<p>The Code of Hammurabi — The powers of the king — Trial by</p>
<p>ordeal — “ Lex Talionis” — Forms of punishment — Codes of</p>
<p>wages and prices — State restoration of stolen goods</p>
<p>Such a society, of course, never dreamed of democracy; its economic
character necessitated a monarchy supported by commercial wealth or
feudal privilege, and protected by the judicious distribution of legal
vio- lence. A landed aristocracy, gradually displaced by a commercial
plutoc- racy, helped to maintain social control, and served as
intermediary between people and king. The latter passed his throne down
to any son of his choosing, with the result that every son considered
himself heir apparent, formed a clique of supporters, and, as like as
not, raised a war of suc- cession if his hopes were unfulfilled . 47
Within the limits of this arbitrary rule the government was carried on
by central and local lords or admin- istrators appointed by the king.
These were advised and checked by provincial or municipal assemblies of
elders or notables, who managed to maintain, even under Assyrian
domination, a proud measure of local self-government. 4 “</p>
<p>Every administrator, and usually the king himself, acknowledged the
guidance and authority of that great body of law which had been given
form under Hammurabi, and had maintained its substance, despite every
change of circumstance and detail, through fifteen centuries. The legal
development was from supernatural to secular sanctions, from severity to
lenience, and from physical to financial penalties. In the earlier days
an appeal to the gods was taken through trial by ordeal. A man accused
of sorcery, or a woman charged with adultery, was invited to leap into
the Euphrates; and the gods were on the side of the best swimmers. If
the woman emerged alive, she was innocent; if the “sorcerer” was
drowned, his accuser received his property; if he was not, he received
the property of his accuser. 4 * The first judges were priests, and to
the end of Baby- lonian history the courts were for the most part
located in the temples;“ but already in the days of Hammurabi secular
courts responsible only to the government were replacing the
judgment-seats presided over by the clergy.</p>
<p>Penology began with the lex talionis, or law of equivalent
retaliation. If a man knocked out an eye or a tooth, or broke a limb, of
a patrician,</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>2 3 I</p>
<p>precisely the same was to be done to him .* 1 If a house collapsed
and killed the purchaser, the architect or builder must die; if the
accident killed the buyer’s son, the son of the architect or builder
must die; if a man struck a girl and killed her not he but his daughter
must suffer the penalty of death . 68 Gradually these punishments in
kind were replaced by awards of damages; a payment of money was
permitted as an alternative to the physical retaliation , 68 and later
the fine became the sole punishment. So the eye of a commoner might be
knocked out for sixty shekels of silver, and the eye of a slave might be
knocked out for thirty. 6 * For the penalty varied not merely with the
gravity of the offense, but with the rank of the offender and the
victim. A member of the aristocracy was subject to severer penalties for
the same crirqe than a man of the people, but an of- fense against such
an aristocrat was a costly extravagance. A plebeian striking a plebeian
was fined ten shekels, or fifty dollars; to strike a person of title or
property cost six times more . 66 From such dissuasions the law passed
to barbarous punishments by amputation or death. A man who struck his
father had his hands cut off ; 60 a physician whose patient died, or
lost an eye, as the result of an operation, had his fingers cut off ; 67
a nurse who knowingly substituted one child for another had to sacrifice
her breasts . 68 Death was decreed for a variety of crimes: rape,
kidnaping, brigandage, burglary, incest, procurement of a husband’s
death by his wife in order to marry another man, the opening or entering
of a wine-shop by a priestess, the harboring of a fugitive slave,
cowardice in the face of the enemy, malfeasance in office, careless or
uneconomical housewifery , 68 or malpractice in the selling of beer.“ In
such rough ways, through thou- sands of years, those traditions and
habits of order and self-restraint were established which became part of
the unconscious basis of civilization.</p>
<p>Within certain limits the state regulated prices, wages and fees.
What the surgeon might charge was established by law; and wages were
fixed by the Code of Hammurabi for builders, brickmakers, tailors,
stone- masons, carpenters, boatmen, herdsmen, and laborers.® The law of
in- heritance made the man’s children, rather than his w ife, his
natural and direct heirs; the widow received her dowry and her
wedding-gift, and re- mained head of the household as long as she lived.
There was no right of primogeniture; the sons inherited equally, and in
this way the largest estates were soon redivided, and the concentration
of wealth was in some measure checked . 08 Private property in land and
goods was taken for granted by the Code.</p>
<p>232 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XWe find no evidence of lawyers in Babylonia, except for priests who
might serve as notaries, and the scribe who would write for pay anything
from a will to a madrigal. The plaintiff preferred his own plea, without
the luxury of terminology. Litigation was discouraged; the very
first</p>
<p>law of the Code reads, wit h almost illegal simplicity: “If a man
bring</p>
<p>an accusation against a man, and charge him with a (capital) crime,
but cannot prove it, the accuser shall be put to death.” 83 There are
signs of bribery, and of tampering with witnesses.“ A court of appeals,
staffed by “the King’s Judges,” sat at Babylon, and a final appeal might
be car - ried to the king himself. There was nothing in the Code about
the</p>
<p>rights of the individual against the state; that was to be a European
inno- vation. But articles 22-24 provided, if not political, at least
economic, protection. “If a man practise brigandage and be captured,
that man shall be put to death. If the brigand be not captured, the man
who has been robbed shall, in the presence of the god, make an itemized
statement of his loss, and the city and governor within whose province
and juris- diction the robbery was committed shall compensate him for
whatever was lost. If it be a life (that was lost), the city and
governor shall pay one mina (00) to the heirs.” What modem city is so
well governed that it would dare to offer such reimbursements to the
victims of its neg- ligence? Has the law progressed since Hammurabi, or
only increased and multiplied?</p>

<p>image of Marduk in solemn procession through the streets. In these
ceremonies the monarch was dressed as a priest, symbolizing the union of
church and state, and perhaps the priestly origin of the kingship. All
the glamor of the supernatural hedged about the throne, and made
rebellion a colossal impiety which risked not only the neck but the
soul. Even the mighty Hammurabi received his laws from the god. From the
patesis or priest-governors of Sumeria to the religious coronation of
Nebuchad- rezzar, Babylon ia remained in effect a theocratic state,
always “under the</p>
<p>The wealth of the temples grew from generation to generation, as the
uneasy rich shared their dividends with the gods. The kings, feeling an
especial need of divine forgiveness, built the temples, equipped them
with furniture, food and slaves, deeded to them great areas of land, and
as- signed to them an annual income from the state. When the army won a
battle, the first share of the captives and the spoils went to the
temples; when any special good fortune befell the king, extraordinary
gifts were dedicated to the gods. Certain lands were required to pay to
the temples a yearly tribute of dates, corn, or fruit; if they failed,
the temples could foreclose on them; and in this way the lands usually
came into pos-</p>
<p>session by the priests. Poor as well as rich turned over to the
temples as much as they thought profitable of their earthly gains. Gold,
silver, copper, lapis lazuli, gems and precious woods accumulated in the
sacred treasury.</p>
<p>As the priests could not directly use or consume this wealth,
they</p>
<p>turned it into productive or investment capital, and became the
greatest agriculturists, manufacturers and financiers of the nation. Not
only did they hold vast tracts of land; they owned a great number of
slaves, or con- trolled hundreds of laborers, who were hired out to
other employers, or worked for the temples in their divers trades from
the playing of music to the brewing of beer . 66 The priests were also
the greatest merchants and financiers of Babylonia; they sold the varied
products of the temple shops, and handled a large proportion of the
country’s trade; they had a reputation for wise investment, and many
persons entrusted their sav- ings to them, confident of a modest but
reliable return. They made loans on more lenient terms than the private
money-lenders; sometimes they lent to the sick or the poor without
interest, merely asking a return of the principal when Marduk should
smile upon the borrower again.“ Finally,</p>
<p>234 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. DC</p>
<p>they performed many legal functions: they served as notaries,
attesting and signing contracts, and making wills; they heard and
decided suits and trials, kept official records, and recorded commercial
transactions.</p>
<p>Occasionally the king commandeered some of the temple accumula- tions
to meet an expensive emergency. But this was rare and dangerous, for the
priests had laid terrible curses upon all who should touch, unpermit-
ted, the smallest jot of ecclesiastical property. Besides, their
influence with the people was ultimately greater than that of the king,
and they might in most cases depose him if they set their combined wits
and powers to this end. They had also the advantage of permanence; the
king died, but the god lived on; the council of priests, free from the
fortunes of elections, illnesses, assassinations and wars, had a
corporate perpetuity that made possible long-term and patient policies,
such as characterize great religious organizations to this day. The
supremacy of the priests under these conditions was inevitable. It was
fated that the merchants should make Babylon, and that the priests
should enjoy it.</p>
<p>Who were the gods that formed the invisible constabulary of the</p>
<p>state? They were numerous, for the imagination of the people was
limit- less, and there was hardly any end to the needs that deities
might serve. An official census of the gods, undertaken in the ninth
century before Christ, counted th em as some 65,000“ Every town had its
tutelary</p>
<p>divinity; and as, in our own time and faith, localities and villages,
after making formal acknowledgment of the Supreme Being, worship
specific minor gods with a special devotion, so Larsa lavished its
temples on Shamash, Uruk on Ishtar, Ur on Nannar — for the Sumerian
pantheon had survived the Sumerian state. The gods were not aloof from
men; most of them lived on earth in the temples, ate with a hearty
appetite, and through nocturnal visits to pious women gave unexpected
children to the busy citizens of Babylon.*</p>
<p>Oldest of all were the astronomic gods: Anu, the immovable firmament,
Shamash, the sun, Nannar, the moon, and Bel or Baal, the earth into
whose bosom all Babylonians returned after death.” Every family had
household gods, to whom prayers were said and libations poured each
morning and night; every individual had a protective divinity (or, as we
should say, a guardian angel) to keep him from harm and joy; and genii
of fertility hov- ered beneficently over the fields. It was probably out
of this multitude of spirits that the Jews moulded their cherubim.</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>*35</p>
<p>We do not find among the Babylonians such signs of monotheism as
appear in Ikhnaton and the Second Isaiah. Two forces, however, brought
them near to it: the enlargement of the state by conquest and growth
brought local deities under the supremacy of a single god; and several
of the cities patrioti- cally conferred omnipotence upon their favored
divin ities. “Trust in Nebo,” says Nebo, “trust in no other god”;” this
is not unlike the first of the com - mandments given to the Jews.
Gradually the number of the gods was less- ened by interpreting the
minor ones as forms or attributes of the major dei- ties. In these ways
the god of Babylon, Marduk, originally a sun god, became sovereign of
all Babylonian divinities.” Hence his title, Bel -Marduk — that is,
Marduk the god. To him and to Ishtar the Babylonians sent up the most
eloquent of their prayers.</p>
<p>Ishtar (Astarte to the Greeks, Ashtoreth to the Jews) interests
us</p>
<p>not only as analogue of the Egyptian Isis and prototype of the
Grecian Aphrodite and the Roman Venus, but as the formal beneficiary of
one of the strangest of Babylonian customs. She was Demeter as well as
Aphrodite — no mere goddess of physical beauty and love, but the
gracious divinity of bounteous motherhood, the secret inspiration of the
growing soil, and the creative principle everywhere. It is impossible to
find much harmony, from a modem point of view, in the attributes and
functions of Ishtar: she was the goddess of war as well as of love, of
prostitutes as well as of mothers; she called herself “a compassionate
courtesan”;™ she was represented sometimes as a bearded bisexual deity,
sometimes as a nude female offering her breasts to suck” and though her
worshipers repeat - edly addressed her as “The Virgin,” “The Holy
Virgin,” and “The</p>
<p>Virgin Mother,” this merely meant that her amours were free from all
taint of wedlock. Gilgamesh rejected her advances on the ground that she
could not be trusted; had she not once loved, seduced, and then slain, a
lion?” It is clear that we must put our own moral code to one side if we
are to understand her. Note with what fervor the Babylonians could lift
up to her throne litanies of laudation only less splendid than those
which a tender piety once raised to die Mother of God:</p>
<p>I beseech thee, Lady of Ladies, Goddess of Goddesses, Ishtar, Queen
of all cities, leader of all men.</p>

<p>With these gods as dramatis person &lt;e the Babylonians constructed
myths which have in large measure come down to us, through the Jews, as
part of our own religious lore. There was first of all the myth of the
crea- tion. In the beginning was Chaos. “In the time when nothing wh ich
was called heaven existed above, and when nothing below had yet received
the name of earth, Apsu, the Ocean, who first was their father, and</p>
<p>Tiamat, Chaos, who gave birth to them all, mingled their waters in
one.” Things slowly began to grow and take form; but suddenly the
monster-</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>goddess Tiamat set out to destroy all the other gods, and to make
her- self — Chaos — supreme. A mighty revolution ensued in which all
order was destroyed. Then another god, Marduk, slew Tiamat with her own
medi- cine by casting a hurricane of wind into her mouth as she opened
it to swallow him; then he thrust his lance into Tiamat’s wind -swollen
paunch, and the goddess of Chaos blew up. Marduk, “recovering his calm,”
says the legend, split the dead Tiamat into two longitudinal halves, as
one does a fish for drying; “then he hung up one of the halves on high,
which be - came the heavens; the other half he spread out under his feet
to form the earth.”” This is as much as we yet know about creation.
Perhaps the ancient poet meant to suggest that the only creation of
which we can know anything is the replacement of chaos with order, for
in the end this is the essence of art and civilization. We should
remember, however, that the defeat of Chaos is only a myth.*</p>
<p>Having moved heaven and earth into place, Marduk undertook to</p>
<p>knead earth with his blood and thereby make men for the service of
the gods. Mesopotamian legends differed on the precise way in which this
was done; they agreed in general that man was fashioned by the deity
from a lump of clay. Usually they represented him as living at first not
in a paradise but in bestial simplicity and ignorance, until a strange
mon- ster called Oannes, half fish and half philosopher, taught him the
arts and sciences, the rules for founding cities, and the principles of
law; after which Oannes plunged into the sea, and wrote a book on the
history of civilization.™ Presently, however, the gods became
dissatisfied with the men whom they had created, and sent a great flood
to destroy them and all their works. The god of wisdom, Ea, took pity on
mankind, and</p>
<p>resolved to save one man at least — Shamash-napishtim — and his wife.
The flood raged; men “encumbered the sea like fishes’ spawn.” Then sud-
denly the gods wept and gnashed their teeth at their own folly, asking
themselves, “Who will make the accustomed offerings now?” But Sham -
ash-napishtim had built an ark, had survived the flood, had perched on
the mountain of Nisir, and had sent out a reconnoitering dove; now he
decided to sacrifice to the gods, who accepted his gifts with surprise
and gratitude. “The gods snuffed up the odor, the gods snuffed up the ex
- cellent odor, the gods gathered like flies above the offering .”

<li>The Babylonian story of creation consists of seven tablets (one for

<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XLovelier than this vague memory of some catastrophic inundation is
the vegetation myth of Ishtar and Tammuz. In the Sumerian form of the
tale Tammuz is Ishtar’s young brother; in the Babylonian form he is
some- times her lover, sometimes her son; both forms seem to have
entered into the myths of Venus and Adonis, Demeter and Persephone, and
a hun- dred scattered legends of death and resurrection. Tammuz, son of
the great god Ea, is a shepherd pasturing his flock under the great tree
Erida (which covers the whole earth with its shade) when Ishtar, always
in- satiable, falls in love with him, and chooses him to be the spouse
of her youth. But Tammuz, like Adonis, is gored to death by a wild boar,
and descends, like all the dead, into that dark subterranean Hades which
the Babylonians called Aralu, and over which they set as ruler
Ishtar’s</p>
<p>jealous sister, Ereshkigal. Ishtar, mourning inconsolably, resolves
to go down to Aralu and restore Tammuz to life by bathing his wounds in
the waters of a healing spring. Soon she appears at the gates of Hades
in all her imperious beauty, and demands entrance. The tablets tell the
story vigorously:</p>
<p>When Ereshkigal heard this,</p>
<p>As when one hews down a tamarisk (she trembled?).</p>
<p>As when one cuts a reed (she shook?).</p>
<p>“What has moved her heart, what has (stirred) her liver?</p>
<p>Ho, there, (does) this one (wish to dwell) with me?</p>
<p>To eat clay as food, to drink (dust?) as wine?</p>
<p>I weep for the men who have left their wives;</p>
<p>I weep for the wives tom from the embrace of their husbands;</p>
<p>For the little ones (cut off) before their time.</p>
<p>Go, gate-keeper, open thy gate for her,</p>
<p>Deal with her according to the ancient decree.”</p>
<p>The ancient decree is that none but the nude shall enter Aralu.
There- fore at each of the successive gates through which Ishtar must
pass, the keeper divests her of some garment or ornament: first her
crown, then her ear-rings, then her necklace, then the ornaments from
her bosom, then her many-jeweled girdle, then the spangles from her
hands and feet, and lastly her loin-cloth; and Ishtar, protesting
gracefully, yields.</p>
<p>Now when Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return,</p>
<p>Ereshkigal saw her and was angered at her presence.</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>Ishtar without reflection threw herself at her.</p>
<p>Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke</p>
<p>To Namtar, her messenger. . . .</p>
<p>“Go, Namtar, (imprison her?) in my palace.</p>
<p>Send against her sixty diseases,</p>
<p>Eye disease against her eyes,</p>
<p>Disease of the side against her side,</p>
<p>Foot-disease against her foot,</p>
<p>Heart-disease against her heart,</p>
<p>Head-disease against her head,</p>
<p>Against her whole being.”</p>
<p>While Ishtar is detained in Hades by these sisterly attentions, the
earth, missing the inspiration of her presence, forgets incredibly all
the arts and ways of love: plant no longer fertilizes plant, vegetation
languishes, ani- mals experience no heat, men cease to yearn.</p>
<p>After the lady Ishtar had gone down into the land of no return.</p>
<p>The bull did not mount the cow, the ass approached not the
she-ass;</p>
<p>To the maid in the street no man drew near;</p>
<p>The man slept in his apartment,</p>
<p>The maid slept by herself.</p>
<p>Population begins to diminish, and the gods note with alarm a sharp
decline in the number of offerings from the earth. In panic they command
Ereshkigal to release Ishtar. It is done, but Ishtar refuses to return
to the surface of the earth unless she is allowed to take Tammuz with
her. She wins her point, passes triumphantly through the seven gates,
receives her loin-cloth, her spangles, her girdle, her pectorals, her
necklace, her ear-rings and her crown. As she appears plants grow and
bloom again, the land swells with food, and every animal resumes the
business of re- producing his kind.“ Love, stronger than death, is
restored to its rightful place as master of gods and men. To the modern
scholar it is only an ad- mirable legend, symbolizing delightfully the
yearly death and rebirth of the soil, and that omnipotence of Venus
which Lucretius was to cele- brate in his own strong verse; to the
Babylonians it was sacred history, faithfully believed and annually
commemorated in a day of mourning and wailing for the dead Tammuz,
followed by riotous rejoicing over his</p>
<p>resurrection.”</p>
<p>240 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XNevertheless the Babylonian derived* no satisfaction from the idea
of per- sonal immortality. His religion was terrestrially practical;
when he prayed he asked not for celestial rewards but for earthly goods
; 83 he could not trust his gods beyond the grave. It is true that one
text speaks of Marduk as he “who gives back life to the dead ,” 84 and
the story of the flood represents its two survivors as living forever.
But for the most part the Babylonian con- ception of another life was
like that of the Greeks: dead men — saints and vil- lains, geniuses and
idiots, alike — went to a dark and shadowy realm within the bowels of
the earth, and none of them saw the light again. There was a heaven, but
only for the gods; the Aralu to which all men descended was a place
frequently of punishment, never of joy; there the dead lay bound hand
and foot forever, shivering with cold, and subject to hunger and thirst
unless their children placed food periodically in their graves . 85
Those who had been especially wicked on earth were subjected to horrible
tortures; leprosy consumed them, or some other of the diseases which
Nergal and Allat, male and female lords of Aralu, had arranged for their
rectification.</p>
<p>Most bodies were buried in vaults; a few were cremated, and their
remains were preserved in urns . 88 The dead body was not embalmed, but
professional mourners washed and perfumed it, clad it presentably,
painted its cheeks, darkened its eyelids, put rings upon its fingers,
and provided it with a change of linen. If the corpse was that of a
woman it was equipped with scent- bottles, combs, cosmetic pencils, and
eye-paint to preserve its fragrance and complexion in the nether world .
87 If not properly buried the dead would torment the living; if not
buried at all, the soul would prowl about sewers and gutters for food,
and might afflict an entire city with pestilence . 88 It was a medley of
ideas not as consistent as Euclid, but sufficing to prod the simple
Babylonian to keep his gods and priests well fed.</p>
<p>The usual offering was food and drink, for these had the advantage
that if they were not entirely consumed by the gods the surplus need not
go to waste. A frequent sacrifice on Babylonian altars was the lamb; and
an old Babylonian incantation strangely anticipates the symbolism of
Judaism and Christianity: “The lamb as a substitute for a man, the lamb
he gives for his life .” 89 Sacrifice was a complex ritual, requiring
the expert services of a priest; every act and word of the ceremony was
settled by sacred tradition, and any amateur deviation from these forms
might mean that the gods would eat without listening. In general, to the
Babylonian, religion meant correct ritual rather than the good life. To
do one’s duty to the gods one had to offer proper sacrifice to the
temples, and recite the appropriate prayers ; 00 for the rest he might
cut out the eyes of his fallen enemy, cut off the hands and feet of
captives, and roast their remainders alive in a furnace , 01 without
much offense to heaven. To participate in — or reverently to attend —
long and solemn</p>

<p>2 4 I</p>
<p>processions like those in which the priests carried from sanctuary to
sanc- tuary the image of Marduk, and performed the sacred drama of his
death and resurrection; to anoint the idols with sweet-scented oils,* to
burn incense before them, clothe them with rich vestments, or adorn them
with jewelry; to offer up the virginity of their daughters in the great
festival of Ishtar; to put food and drink before the gods, and to be
generous to the priests — these were the essential works of the devout
Babylonian soul . 98</p>
<p>Perhaps we misjudge him, as doubtless the future will misjudge us
from the fragments that accident will rescue from our decay. Some of the
finest literary relics of the Babylonians are prayers that breathe a
profound and sincere piety. Hear the proud Nebuchadrezzar humbly
addressing Marduk:</p>
<p>Without thee, Lord, what could there be</p>
<p>For the king thou lovest, and dost call his name?</p>
<p>Thou shalt bless his title as thou wilt,</p>
<p>And unto him vouchsafe a path direct.</p>
<p>I, the prince obeying thee,</p>
<p>Am what thy hands have made.</p>
<p>’Tis thou who art my creator,</p>
<p>Entrusting me with the rule of hosts of men.</p>
<p>According to thy mercy, Lord, . . .</p>
<p>Turn into loving-kindness thy dread power,</p>
<p>And make to spring up in my heart</p>
<p>A. reverence for thy divinity.</p>
<p>Give as thou thinkest best . 94</p>
<p>The surviving literature abounds in hymns full of that passionate
self abasement with which the Semite tries to control and conceal his
pride. Many of them take the character of “penitential psalms,” and
prepare</p>
<p>I, thy servant, full of sighs cry unto thee.</p>
<p>Thou acceptest the fervent prayer of him who is burdened with
sin.</p>
<p>Thou lookest upon a man, and that man lives. . . .</p>
<p>Look with true favor upon me, and accept my supplication. . . .</p>
<p>Therefore Tammuz was called “The Anointed.” 93</p>

<p>X242</p>
<p>And then, as if uncertain of the sex of the god —</p>
<p>How long, my god,</p>
<p>How long, my goddess, until thy face be turned to me?</p>
<p>How long, known and unknown god, until the anger of thy heart</p>
<p>shall be appeased?</p>
<p>How long, known and unknown goddess, until thy unfriendly heart</p>
<p>be appeased?</p>
<p>Mankind is perverted, and has no judgment;</p>
<p>Of all men who are alive, who knows anything?</p>
<p>They do not know whether they do good or evil.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not cast aside thy servant;</p>
<p>He is cast into the mire; take his hand!</p>
<p>The sin which I have sinned, turn to mercy!</p>
<p>The iniquity which I have committed, let the wind carry away!</p>
<p>My many transgressions tear off like a garment!</p>
<p>My god, my sins are seven times seven; forgive my sins!</p>
<p>My goddess, my sins are seven times seven; forgive my sins! . . .</p>
<p>Forgive my sins, and I will humble myself before thee.</p>
<p>May thy heart, as the heart of a mother who hath borne children,</p>
<p>be glad;</p>
<p>As a mother who hath borne children, as a father who hath begotten,
may it be glad ! 85</p>
<p>Such psalms and hymns were sung sometimes by the priests, sometimes
by the congregation, sometimes by both in strophe and antistrophe. Per-
haps the strangest circumstance about them is that — like all the
religious literature of Babylon — they were written in the ancient
Sumerian lan- guage, which served the Babylonian and Assyrian churches
precisely as Latin serves the Roman Catholic Church today. And just as a
Catholic hymnal may juxtapose the Latin text to a vernacular
translation, so some of the hymns that have come down to us from
Mesopotamia have a Babylonian or Assyrian translation written between
the lines of the</p>
<p>“classic” Sumerian original, in the fashion of a contemporary
schoolboy’s “interlinear.” And as the form of these hymns and rituals
led to the</p>
<p>Psalms of the Jews and the liturgy of the Roman Church, so their
content presaged the pessimistic and sin-struck plaints of the Jews, the
early Christians, and the modern Puritans. The sense of sin, though it
did not interfere victoriously in Babylonian life, filled the Babylonian
chants, and rang a note that survives in all Semitic liturgies and their
anti-Semitic</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>derivatives. “Lord,” cries one hymn, “my sins are many, great are my
misdeeds! … I sink under affliction, I can no longer raise my head; I
turn to my merciful God to call upon him, and I groan! . . . Lord,
reject not thy servant!” M</p>
<p>These groanings were rendered more sincere by the Babylonian concep-
tion of sin. Sin was no mere theoretical state of the soul; like
sickness it was the possession of the body by a demon that might destroy
it. Prayer was in the nature of an incantation against a demon that had
come down upon the individual out of the ocean of magic forces in which
the ancient Orient lived and moved. Everywhere, in the Babylonian view,
these hostile demons lurked: they hid in strange crannies, slipped
through doors or even through bolts and sockets, and pounced upon their
victims in the form of illness or madness whenever some sin had
withdrawn for a moment the beneficent guardianship of the gods. Giants,
dwarfs, cripples, above all, women, had sometimes the power, even with a
glance of the “evil eye,” to infuse such a destructive spirit into the
bodies of those toward whom they were ill-dis- posed. Partial protection
against these demons was provided by the use of magic amulets, talismans
and kindred charms; images of the gods, carried on the body, would
usually suffice to frighten the devils away. Little stones strung on a
thread or a chain and hung about the neck were especially effective, but
care had to be taken that the stones were such as tradition asso- ciated
with good luck, and the thread had to be of black, white or red
according to the purpose in view. Thread spun from virgin kids was par-
ticularly powerful. 07 But in addition to such means it was .wise also
to exor- cise the demon by fervent incantation and magic ritual — for
example, by sprinkling the body with water taken from the sacred streams
— the Tigris or the Euphrates. Or an image of the demon could be made,
placed on a boat, and sent over the water with a proper formula; if the
boat could be made to capsize, so much the better. The demon might be
persuaded, by the appro- priate incantation, to leave its human victim
and enter an animal — a bird, a pig, most frequently a lamb. 08</p>
<p>Magic formulas for the elimination of demons, the avoidance of evil
and the prevision of the future constitute the largest category in the
Babylonian writings found in the library of Ashurbanipal. Some of the
tablets are manuals of astrology; others are lists of omens celestial
and terrestrial, with expert advice for reading them; others are
treatises on the interpretation of dreams, rivaling in their ingenious
incredibility the most advanced products of modem psychology; still
others offer instruction in divining the future by examining the
entrails of animals, or by observing the form and position of a</p>
<p>244 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xdrop of oil let fall into a jar of water.” Hepatoscopy— observation
of the liver of animals — was a favorite method of divination among the
Babylonian priests, and passed from them into the classical world; for
the liver was believed to be the seat of the mind in both animals and
men. No king would undertake a campaign or advance to a battle, no
Babylonian would risk a crucial decision or begin an enterprise of great
moment, without employing a priest or a soothsayer to read the omens for
him in one or another of these recondite ways.</p>
<p>Never was a civilization richer in superstitions. Every turn of
chance</p>
<p>from the anomalies of birth to the varieties of death received a
popular, sometimes an official and sacerdotal, interpretation in magical
or super- natural terms. Every movement of the rivers, every aspect of
the stars, every dream, every unusual performance of man or beast,
revealed the future to the properly instructed Babylonian. The fate of a
king could be forecast by observing the movements of a dog, 1 “ just as
we foretell the length of the winter by spying upon the groundhog. The
superstitions of Babylonia seem ridiculous to us, because they differ
superficially from our own. There is hardly an absurdity of the past
that cannot be found flourishing somewhere in the present. Underneath
all civilization, ancient or modem, moved and still moves a sea of
magic, superstition and sorcery. Perhaps they will remain when the works
of our reason have passed away.</p>
<p>V. THE MORALS OF BABYLON</p>
<p>Religion divorced from morals — Sacred prostitution — Free love —</p>
<p>Marriage — Adultery — Divorce — The position of woman —</p>
<p>The relaxation of morals</p>
<p>This religion, with all its failings, probably helped to prod the
common Babylonian into some measure of decency and civic docility, else
we should be hard put to explain the generosity of the kings to the
priests. Apparently, however, it had no influence upon the morals of the
upper classes in the later centuries, for (in the eyes and words of her
prejudiced enemies) the “whore of Babylon” was a “sink of iniquity,” and
a scandal - ous example of luxurious laxity to all the ancient world.
Even Alexander, who was not above dying of drinking, was shocked by the
morals of Babylon. 1 “</p>
<p>The most striking feature of Babylonian life, to an alien observer,
was the custom known to us chiefly from a famous page in Herodotus:</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>2 45</p>
<p>Every native woman is obliged, once in her life, to sit in the
tem-</p>
<p>ple of Venus, and have intercourse with some stranger. And many</p>
<p>disdaining to mix with the rest, being proud on account of their</p>
<p>wealth, come in covered carriages, and take up their station at
the</p>
<p>temple with a numerous train of servants attending them. But the</p>
<p>far greater part do thus: many sit down in the temple of Venus,</p>
<p>wearing a crown of cord round their heads; some are continually</p>
<p>coming in, and others are going out. Passages marked out in a</p>
<p>straight line lead in every direction through the women, along which
strangers pass and make their choice. When a woman has once</p>
<p>seated herself she must not return home till some stranger has thrown
a piece of silver into her lap, and lain with her outside the
temple.</p>
<p>He who throws the silver must say thus: “I beseech the goddess</p>
<p>Mylitta to favor thee”; for the Assyrians call Venus Mylitta.*
The</p>
<p>silver may be ever so small, for she will not reject it, inasmuch as
it</p>
<p>is not lawful for her to do so, for such silver is accounted
sacred.</p>
<p>The woman follows the first man that throws, and refuses no one.</p>
<p>But when she has had intercourse and has absolved herself from her
obligation to the goddess, she returns home; and after that time,</p>
<p>however great a sum you may give her you will not gain possession</p>
<p>of her. Those that are endowed with beauty and symmetry of shape are
soon set free; but the deformed are detained a long time, from</p>
<p>inability to satisfy the law, for some wait for a space of three
or</p>
<p>four years . 108</p>
<p>What was the origin of this strange rite? Was it a relic of
ancient</p>
<p>sexual communism, a concession, by the future bridegroom, of the jus
prim# noctis , or right of the first night, to the community as
represented by any casual and anonymous citizen ? 108 Was it due to the
bridegroom’s fear of harm from the violation of the tabu against
shedding blood ? 104 Was it a physical preparation for marriage, such as
is still practised among some Australian tribes ? 105 Or was it simply a
sacrifice to the goddess — an offer- ing of first fruits ? 106 We do not
know.</p>
<p>Such women, of course, were not prostitutes. But various classes of
prostitutes lived within the temple precincts, plied their trade there,
and amassed, some of them, great fortunes. Such temple prostitutes were
common in western Asia: we find them in Israel , 107 Phrygia, Phoenicia,
Syria, etc.; in Lydia and Cyprus the girls earned their marriage dowries
# “Assyrians” meant for the Greeks both Assyrians and Babylonians.
“Mylitta” was one of the forms of Ishtar</p>
<p>246 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xin this way.” 8 “Sacred prostitution” continued in Babylonia until
abol - ished by Constantine (ca. 325 A.D.).“ 9 Alongside it, in the
wine-shops kept by women, secular prostitution flourished. 1 ”</p>
<p>In general the Babylonians were allowed considerable premarital ex-
perience. It was considered permissible for men and women to form un-
licensed unions, “trial marriages,” terminable at the will of either
party; but the woman in such cases was obliged to wear an olive — in
stone or terra cotta — as a sign that she was a concubine. 1 ” Some
tablets indicate that the Babylonians wrote poems, and sang songs, of
love; but all that remai ns of these is an occasional first line, like
“My love is a light,” or “My heart is full of merriment and song.” 1 ”
One letter, dating from 2100 b.c., is in the tone of Napoleon’s early
messages to Josephine: “To</p>
<p>Bibiya: . . . May Shamash and Marduk give thee health forever. …
I</p>
<p>have sent (to ask) after thy health; let me know how thou art. I have
arrived in Babylon, and see thee not; I am very sad.” 118</p>
<p>Legal marriage was arranged by the parents, and was sanctioned by an
exchange of gifts obviously descended from marriage by purchase. The
suitor presented to the father of the bride a substantial present, but
the father was expected to give her a dowry greater in value than the
gift, 114 so that it was difficult to say who was purchasd, the woman or
the man. Sometimes, however, the arrangement was unabashed purchase;
Shamashnazir, for example, received ten shekels (0) as the price of his
daughter. 1 ” If we are to believe the Father of History,</p>
<p>those who had marriageable daughters used to bring them once a</p>
<p>year to a place where a great number of men gathered round them.</p>
<p>A public crier made them stand up and sold them all, one after
an-</p>
<p>other. He began with the most beautiful, and having got a large sum
for her he put up the second fairest. But he only sold them on con-</p>
<p>dition that the buyers married them. . . . This very wise custom
no</p>
<p>longer exists.” 8</p>
<p>Despite these strange practices, Babylonian marriage seems to have
been as monogamous and faithful as marriage in Christendom is today.
Premarital freedom was followed by the rigid enforcement of marital
fidelity. The adulterous wife and her paramour, according to the Code,
were drowned, unless the husband, in his mercy, preferred to let his
wife off by turning her almost naked into the streets.” 7 Hammurabi out
- Caesared Caesar: “If the finger have been pointed at the wife of a man

<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. Dt)</p>
<p>cause of another man, and she have not been taken in lying with
another man, for her husband’s sake she shall throw herself into the
river”™— per- haps the law was intended as a discouragement to gossip.
The man could divorce his wife simply by restoring her dowry to her and
saying, “Thou art not my wife”; but if she said to him, “Thou art not my
husband,” s he was to be drowned.™ Childlessness, adultery,
incompatibility, or careless management of the household might satisfy
the law as ground for grant- ing the man a divorce™ indeed “if she have
not been a careful mistress, have gadded about, have neglected her
house, and have belittled her chil- dren, they shall throw that woman
into the water.” m As against this in - credible severity of the Code,
we find that in practice the woman, though she might not divorce her
husband, was free to leave him, if she could show cruelty on his part
and fidelity on her own; in such cases she could return to her parents,
and take her marriage portion with her, along with what other property
she might have acquired.™ (The women of Eng - land did not enjoy these
rights till the end of the nineteenth century.) If a woman’s husband was
kept from her, through business or war, for any length of time, and had
left no means for her maintenance, she might cohabit with another man
without legal prejudice to her reunion with her husband on the latter’s
return.™</p>
<p>In general the position of woman in Babylonia was lower than in</p>
<p>Egypt or Rome, and yet not worse than in classic Greece or medieval
Europe. To carry out her many functions — begetting and rearing chil-
dren, fetching water from the river or the public well, grinding corn,
cooking, spinning, weaving, cleaning — she had to be free to go about in
public very much like the man.™ She could own property, enjoy its</p>
<p>income, sell and buy, inherit and bequeath.™ Some women k ept shops,
and carried on commerce; some even became scribes, indicating that girls
as well as boys might receive an education.™ But the Semitic practice
of</p>
<p>248 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xairy in Herodotus’ report that the Babylonians, when besieged, “had
strangled their wives, to prevent the consumption of their
provisions.’”“ With some excuse, then, the Egyptians looked down upon
the Baby- lonians as not quite civilized. We miss here the refinement of
character and feeling indicated by Egyptian literature and art. When
refinement came to Babylon it was in the guise of an effeminate
degeneracy: young men dyed and curled their hair, perfumed their flesh,
rouged their cheeks, and adorned themselves with necklaces, bangles,
ear-rings and pendants. After the Persian Conquest the death of
self-respect brought an end of self-restraint; the manners of the
courtesan crept into every class; women of good family came to consider
it mere courtesy to reveal their charms indiscriminately for the
greatest happiness of the greatest number;” 0 and “every man of the
people in his poverty,” if we may credit Herodotus, “prostituted his
daughters for money.”” 1 “There is nothing more extraor - dinary than
the manners of this city,” wrote Quintus Curtius (42 a.d.), “and nowhere
are things better arranged with a view to voluptuous pleas - ures.”“*
Morals grew lax when the templ es grew rich; and the citizens of
Babylon, wedded to delight, bore with equanimity the subjection of their
city by the Kassites, the Assyrians, the Persians, and the Greeks.</p>

<p>Did this life of venery, piety and trade receive any ennobling

judge a civiliza- tion from such fragments as the ocean of time has
thrown up from the wreckage of Babylon. These fragments are chiefly
liturgical, magical and commercial. Whether through accident or through
cultural poverty, Babylonia, like Assyria and Persia, has left us a very
middling heritage of literature as compared with Egypt and Palestine;

<p>listed their academic degrees on their cards. The Babylonians wrote
in cuneiform upon tablets of damp clay, with a stylus or pencil cut at
the end into a triangular prism or wedge; when the tablets were filled
they dried and baked them into strange but durable manuscripts of brick.

Tablets in jars classified and arranged on shelves filled numerous
libraries in the temples and palaces of Babylonia. These Babylonian
libraries are lost; but one of the greatest of them, that of Borsippa,
was copied and preserved in the library of Ashurbanipal, whose 30,000
tablets are the main source of our knowledge of Babylonian life.</p>
<p>The decipherment of Babylonian baffled students for centuries; their
final success is an honorable chapter in the history of scholarship. In
1802 Georg Grotefend, professor of Greek at the University of Gottingen,
told the Gottingen Academy how for years he had puzzled over certain
cuneiform inscriptions from ancient Persia; how at last he had
identified eight of the forty-two characters used, and had made out the
names of three kings in the inscriptions. There, for the most part, the
matter rested until 1835, when Henry Rawlinson, a British diplomatic
officer stationed in Persia, quite un- aware of Grotefend’s work,
likewise worked out the names of Hystaspes, Darius and Xerxes in an
inscription couched in Old Persian, a cuneiform de- rivative of
Babylonian script; and through these names he finally deciphered the
entire document. This, however, was not Babylonian; Rawlinson had still
to find, like Champollion, a Rosetta Stone — in this case some
inscription bear- ing the same text in old Persian and Babylonian. He
found it three hundred feet high on an almost inaccessible rock at
Behistun, in the mountains of Media, where Darius I had caused his
carvers to engrave a record of his wars and victories in three languages
— old Persian, Assyrian, and Babylonian. Day after day Rawlinson risked
himself on these rocks, often suspending himself by a rope, copying
every character carefully, even making plastic impressions of all the
engraved surfaces. After twelve years of work he succeeded in
translating both the Babylonian and the Assyrian texts (1847). To test
these and similar findings, the Royal Asiatic Society sent an
unpublished cuneiform document to four Assyriologists, and asked them —
working without contact or communication with one another — to make
independent translations. The four reports were found to be in almost
complete agreement. Through these un- heralded campaigns of scholarship
the perspective of history was enriched with a new civilization. 184</p>
<p>The Babylonian language was a Semitic development of the old tongues
of Sumeria and Akkad. It was written in characters originally Sumerian,
but</p>
<p>25O THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xthe vocabulary diverged in time (like French from Latin) into a
language so different from Sumerian that the Babylonians had to compose
dictionaries and grammars to transmit the old “classic” and sacerdotal
tongue of Sumeria to young scholars and priests. Almost a fourth of the
tablets found in the royal library at Nineveh is devoted to dictionaries
and grammars of the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian languages.
According to tradition, such dictionaries had been made as far back as
Sargon of Akkad — so old is scholarship. In Babylonian, as in Sumerian,
the characters represented not letters but sylla- bles; Babylon never
achieved an alphabet of its own, but remained content with a “syllabary”
of some three hundred signs. The memorizing of these syllabic symbols
formed, with mathematics and religious instruction, the cur- riculum of
the temple schools in which the priests imparted to the young as much as
it was expedient for them to know. One excavation unearthed an ancient
classroom in which the clay tablets of boys and girls who had copied
virtuous maxims upon them some two thousand years before Christ still
lay on the floor, as if some almost welcome disaster had suddenly inter-
rupted the lesson. 136</p>
<p>The Babylonians, like the Phoenicians, looked upon letters as a
device for facilitating business; they did not spend much of their clay
upon literature. We find animal fables in verse — one generation of an
endless dynasty; hymns in strict meter, sharply divided lines and
elaborate stanzas; 130 very little sur- viving secular verse; religious
rituals presaging, but never becoming, drama; and tons of
historiography. Official chroniclers recorded the piety and con- quests
of the kings, the vicissitudes of each temple, and the important events
in the career of each city. Berosus, the most famous of Babylonian
historians (ca. 280 b.c.) narrated with confidence full details
concerning the creation of the world and the early history of man: the
first king of Babylonia had been chosen by a god, and had reigned 36,000
years; from the beginning of the world to the great Flood, said Berosus,
with praiseworthy exactitude and comparative moderation, there had
elapsed 691,200 years. 137</p>
<p>Twelve broken tablets found in Ashurbanipal’s library, and now in the
British Museum, form the most fascinating relic of Mesopotamian litera-
ture — the Epic of Gilgamesh. Like the Iliad it is an accretion of
loosely connected stories, some of which go back to Sumeria 3000 b.c.;
part of it is the Babylonian account of the Flood. Gilgamesh was a
legendary ruler of Uruk or Erech, a descendant of the Shamash-napishtim
who had sur- vived the Deluge, and had never died. Gilgamesh enters upon
the scene as a sort of Adonis-Samson — tall, massive, heroically
powerful and troub- lesomely handsome.</p>

create another son equal to Gilgamesh and able to keep him busy in
conflict, so that the husbands of Uruk may have peace. Aruru kneads a
bit of clay, spits upon it, and moulds from it the satyr Engidu, a man
with the</p>

<p>Engidu forgot where he was born. 13 ”</p>
<p>For six days but seven nights Engidu remains with the sacred woman.
When he tires of pleasure he awakes to find his friends the animals</p>
<p>gone, whereupon he swoons with sorrow. But the priestess chides him:
“Thou who art superb as a god, why dost thou live among the beasts of
the field? Come, I will conduct thee to Uruk, where is Gilgamesh, whose
might is supreme.” Ensnared by the vanity of praise and the conceit of
his strength, Engidu follows the priestess to Uruk, saying, “Lead me to
the place where is Gilgamesh. I will fight with him and manifest to him
my power”; whereat the gods and husbands are well pleased . But Gilga-
mesh overcomes him, first with strength, then with kindness; they become
devoted friends; they march forth together to protect Uruk from Elam;
they return glorious with exploits and victory. Gilgamesh “put aside</p>
<p>his war-harness, he put on his white garments, he adorned himself
with the royal insignia, and bound on the diadem.” Thereupon Ishtar the
in - satiate falls in love with him, raises her great eyes to him, and
says:</p>
<p>“Come, Gilgamesh, be my husband, thou! Thy love, give it to me</p>
<p>as a gift; thou shalt be my spouse, and I shall be thy wife. I
shall</p>
<p>place thee in a chariot of lapis and gold, with golden wheels and</p>

<p>. . . All the country by the sea shall embrace thy feet, kings
shall</p>
<p>bow down before thee, the gifts of the mountains and the plains</p>
<p>they will bring before thee as tribute.”</p>
<p>Gilgamesh rejects her, and reminds her of the hard fate she has
inflicted upon her varied lovers, including Tammuz, a hawk, a stallion,
a gardener</p>

<p>and a lion. “Thou lovest me now,” he tells her; “afterwards thou wilt
strike me as thou didst these.” The angry Ishtar asks of the g reat god
Anu that he create a wild urus to kill Gilgamesh. Anu refuses, and re-
bukes her: “Canst thou not remain quiet now that Gilgamesh has enu -
merated to thee thy unfaithfulness and ignominies?” She threatens
that</p>
<p>Ishtar strikes him down in the midst of his glory by afflicting
Engidu with a mortal illness.</p>
<p>Mourning over the corpse of his friend, whom he has loved more than
any woman, Gilgamesh wonders over the mystery of death. Is there no
escape from that dull fatality? One man eluded it — Shamash-napish- tim;
he would know the secret of deathlessness. Gilgamesh resolves to seek
Shamash-napishtim, even if he must cross the world to find him. The way
leads through a mountain guarded by a pair of giants whose heads touch
the sky and whose breasts reach down to Hades. But they let</p>
<p>him pass, and he picks his way for twelve miles through a dark
tunnel. He emerges upon the shore of a great ocean, and sees, far over
the waters, the throne of Sabitu, virgin-goddess of the seas. He calls
out to her to help him cross the water; “if it cannot be done, I will
lay me down on the land and die.” Sabitu takes pity upon him, and allows
him to cross</p>
<p>through forty days of tempest to the Happy Island where lives
Shamash- napishtim, possessor of immortal life. Gilgamesh begs of him
the secret of deathiessness. Shamash-napishtim answers by telling at
length the story of the Flood, and how the gods, relenting of their mad
destructiveness, had made him and his wife immortal because they had
preserved the human species. He offers Gilgamesh a plant whose fruit
will confer re- newed youth upon him who eats it; and Gilgamesh, happy,
starts back on his long journey home. But on the way he stops to bathe,
and while he bathes a serpent crawls by and steals the plant.*</p>
<p>Desolate, Gilgamesh reaches Uruk. He prays in temple after temple</p>
<p>that Engidu may be allowed to return to life, if only to speak to him
for a moment. Engidu appears, and Gilgamesh inquires of him the state

the earth before thee, if I were to tell thee that which I have seen,
terror would overthrow thee, thou wouldst faint away.” Gilgamesh, symbol
of that brave stupidity, philoso phy, persists in his quest for truth:

<p>The lesser arts — Music — Painting — Sculpture — Bas-relief —</p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<p>The story of Gilgamesh is almost the only example by which we may
judge the literary art of Babylon. That a keen esthetic sense, if not a
profound creative spirit, survived to some degree the Babylonian absorp-
tion in commercial life, epicurean recreation and compensatory piety,
may be seen in the chance relics of the minor arts. Patiently glazed
tiles, glittering stones, finely wrought bronze, iron, silver and gold,
delicate embroideries, soft rugs and richly dyed robes, luxurious
tapestries, pedes- taled tables, beds and chairs 1 * 1 — these lent
grace, if not dignity or final worth, to Babylonian civilization.
Jewelry abounded in quantity, but missed the subtle artistry of Egypt;
it went in for a display of yellow</p>
<p>metal, and thought it artistic to make entire statues of gold. 1 “
There were many musical instruments — flutes, psalteries, harps,
bagpipes, lyres, drums, horns, reed-pipes, trumpets, cymbals and
tambourines. Orchestras played and singers sang, individually and
chorally, in temples and palaces, and at the feasts of the well-to-do .
1 * 5</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>Painting was purely subsidiary; it decorated walls and statuary, but
made no attempt to become an independent art . 144 We do not find among
Baby- lonian ruins the distemper paintings that glorified the Egyptian
tombs, or such frescoes as adorned the palaces of Crete. Babylonian
sculpture remained similarly undeveloped, and was apparently stiffened
into an early death by conventions derived from Sumeria and enforced by
the priests: all the faces portrayed are one face, all the kings have
the same thick and muscular frame, all the captives are cast in one
mould. Very little Babylonian statuary sur- vives, and that without
excuse. The bas-reliefs are better, but they too are stereotyped and
crude; a great gulf separates them from the mobile vigor of the reliefs
that the Egyptians had carved a thousand years before; they</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) BABYLONIA 255</p>
<p>reach sublimity only when they depict animals possessed of the silent
dignity of nature, or enraged by the cruelty of men . 146</p>
<p>Babylonian architecture is safe from judgment now, for hardly any of
its remains rise to more than a few feet above the sands; and there are
no carved or painted representations among the relics to show us clearly
the form and structure of palaces and temples. Houses were built of
dried mud, or, among the rich, of brick; they seldom knew windows, and
their doors opened not upon the narrow street but upon an interior court
shaded from the sun. Tradition describes the better dwellings as rising
to three or four stories in height . 140 The temple was raised upon
foundations level with the roofs of the houses whose life it was to
dominate; usually it was an enormous square of tiled masonry, built,
like the houses, around a court; in this court most of the religious
ceremonies were performed. Near the temple, in most cases, rose a
ziggurat (literally “a high place”)— a tower of superimposed and dimin-
ishing cubical stories surrounded by external stairs. Its uses were
partly reli- gious, as a lofty shrine for the god, partly astronomic, as
an observatory from which the priests could watch the all-revealing
stars. The great ziggurat at Borsippa was called “The Stages of the
Seven Spheres”; each story was dedicated to one of the seven planets
known to Babylonia, and bore a sym- bolic color. The lowest was black,
as the color of Saturn; the next above it was white, as the color of
Venus; the next was purple, for Jupiter; the fourth blue, for Mercury;
the fifth scarlet, for Mars; the sixth silver, for the moon; the seventh
gold, for the sun. These spheres and stars, beginning at the top,
designated the days of the week . 147</p>
<p>There was not much art in this architecture, so far as we can
vision</p>
<p>it now; it was a mass of straight lines seeking the glory of size.
Here and there among the ruins are vaults and arches — forms derived
from Sumeria, negligently used, and unconscious of their destiny.
Decoration, interior and exterior, was almost confined to enameling some
of the brick surfaces with bright glazes of yellow, blue, white and red,
with occasional tiled figures of animals or plants. The use of vitrified
glaze, not merely to beautify, but to protect the masonry from sun and
rain, was at least as old as Naram-sin, and was to continue in
Mesopotamia down to Moslem days. In this way ceram- ics, though seldom
producing rememberable pottery, became the most characteristic art of
the ancient Near East. Despite such aid, Babylonian architecture
remained a heavy and prosaic thing, condemned to mediocrity by the
material it used. The temples rose rapidly out of the earth which slave
labor turned so readily into brick and cementing pitch; they did not
require centuries for their erection, like the monumental structures of
Egypt or medieval Europe. But they decayed almost as quickly as they
rose; fifty years of neglect reduced them to the dust from which they
had been made . 148</p>

<li>BABYLONIAN SCIENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematics — Astronomy — The calendar — Geography — Medicine</p>
<p>Being merchants, the Babylonians were more likely to achieve
successes in science than in art. Commerce created mathematics, and
united with religion to beget astronomy. In their varied functions as
judges, adminis- trators, agricultural and industrial magnates, and
soothsayers skilled in examining entrails and stars, the priests of
Mesopotamia unconsciously laid the foundations of those sciences which,
in the profane hands of the Greeks, were for a time to depose religion
from its leadership of the world.</p>
<p>Babylonian mathematics rested on a division of the circle into
360</p>
<p>degrees, and of the year into 360 days; on this basis it developed
a</p>
<p>sexagesimal system of calculation by sixties, which became the parent
of later duodecimal systems of reckoning by twelves. The numeration</p>
<p>used only three figures: a sign for 1, repeated up to 9; a sign for
10, re- peated up to 90; and a sign for 100. Computation was made easier
by tables which showed not only multiplication and division, but the
halves, quarters, thirds, squares and cubes of the basic numbers.
Geometry ad- vanced to the measurement of complex and irregular areas.
The Baby- lonian figure for ir (the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter of a circle) was 3 — a very crude approximation for a nation of
astronomers.</p>
<p>Astronomy was the special science of the Babylonians, for which they
were famous throughout the ancient world. Here again magic was the
mother of science: the Babylonians studied the stars not so much to
chart the courses of caravans and ships, as to divine the future fates
of men; they were astrologers first and astronomers afterward. Every
planet was a god, interested and vital in the affairs of men: Jupiter
was Marduk, Mercury was Nabu, Mars was Nergal, the sun was Shamash, the
moon was Sin, Saturn was Ninib, Venus was Ishtar. Every movement of
every star determined, or forecast, some terrestrial event: if, for
example, the moon was low, a distant nation would submit to the king; if
the moon was in crescent the king would overcome the enemy. Such efforts
to wring the future out of the stars became a passion with the
Babylonians; priests</p>
<p>BABYLONIA</p>
<p>CHAP. DC)</p>
<p>*57</p>
<p>skilled in astrology reaped rich rewards from both people and king.
Some of them were sincere students, poring zealously over astrologic
tomes which, according to their traditions, had been composed in the
days of Sargon of Akkad; they complained of the quacks who, without
such</p>
<p>study, went about reading horoscopes for a fee, or predicting the
weather a year ahead, in the fashion of our modern almanacs. 149</p>
<p>Astronomy developed slowly out of this astrologic observation and</p>
<p>charting of the stars. As far back as 2000 b . c . the Babylonians
had made accurate records of the heliacal rising and setting of the
planet Venus; they had fixed the position of various stars, and were
slowly mapping the sky. 1 * The Kassite conquest interrupted this
development for a thou- sand years. Then, under Nebuchadrezzar,
astronomic progress was re- sumed; the priest-scientists plotted the
orbits of sun and moon, noted their conjunctions and eclipses,
calculated the courses of the planets, and made the first clear
distinction between a planet and a star;* 1 “ they determined the dates
of winter and summer solstices, of vernal and autumnal</p>
<p>equinoxes, and, following the lead of the Sumerians, divided the
ecliptic (i.e., the path of the earth around the sun) into the twelve
signs of the Zodiac. Having divided the circle into 360 degrees, they
divided the</p>
<p>degree into sixty minutes, and the minute into sixty seconds. 162
They measured time by a clepsydra or water-clock, and a sun-dial, and
these seem to have been not merely developed but invented by them.
166</p>
<p>They divided the year into twelve lunar months, six having thirty
days, six twenty-nine; and as this made but 354 days in all, they added
a thir- teenth month occasionally to harmonize the calendar with the
seasons. The month was divided into four weeks according to the four
phases of the moon. An attempt was made to establish a more convenient
calendar by dividing the month into six weeks of five days; but the
phases of the moon proved more effective than the conveniences of men.
The day was reckoned not from midnight to midnight but from one rising
of the</p>
<p>moon to the next; 164 it was divided into twelve hours, and each of
these hours was divided into thirty minutes, so that the Babylonian
minute had the feminine quality of being four times as long as its name
might suggest. The division of our month into four weeks, of our clock

<p>The dependence of Babylonian science upon religion had a more</p>
<p>stagnant effect in medicine than in astronomy. It was not so much the
ob- scurantism of the priests that held the science back, as the
superstition of the people. Already by the time of Hammurabi the art of
healing had separated itself in some measure from the domain and
domination of the clergy; a regular profession of physician had been
established, with fees and penalties fixed by law. A patient who called
in a doctor could know in advance just how much he would have to pay for
such treatment or operation; and if he belonged to the poorer classes
the fee was lowered accordingly. 1 “ If the doctor bungled badly he had
to pay damages to the patient; in extreme cases, as we have seen, his
fingers were cut off so that he might not readily experiment again. 1
“</p>
<p>But this almost secularized science found itself helpless before the
de- mand of the people for supernatural diagnosis and magical cures.
Sorcer- ers and necromancers were more popular than physicians, and
enforced, by their influence with the populace, irrational methods of
treatment.</p>
<p>Disease was possession, and was due to sin; therefore it had to be
treated mainly by incantations, magic and prayer; when drugs were used
they were aimed not to cleanse the patient but to terrify and exorcise
the demon. The favorite drug was a mixture deliberately compounded of
dis- gusting elements, apparently on the theory that the sick man had
a</p>
<p>stronger stomach than the demon that possessed him; the usual
ingredi- ents were raw meat, snake-flesh and wood-shavings mixed with
wine and oil; or rotten food, crushed bones, fat and dirt, mingled with
animal or human urine or excrement. 1 “ Occasionally this Dreckapothek
was re- placed by an effort to appease the demon with milk, honey,
cream, and sweet-smelling herbs. 1 “ If all treatment failed, the
patient was in some cases carried into the market-place, so that his
neighbors might indulge their ancient propensity for prescribing
infallible cures. 1 “</p>

A clay tablet found in the ruins of Gasur (two hundred miles north of
Babylon), and dated back to 1600 b.c., contains, in a space hardly an
inch square, a map of the province of Shat- Azalia; it represents

lines; the names of various towns are inscribed, and the direction of
north and south is indicated in the margin. 155</p>

magical</p>
<p>cures were merely subtle uses of the power of suggestion; perhaps
those evil concoctions were intended as emetics; and the Babylonian may
have meant nothing more irrational by his theory of illness as due to
invading demons and the patient’s sins than we do by interpreting it as
due to invading bacteria invited by culpable negligence, uncleanliness,
or greed. We must not be too sure of the ignorance of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Religion and Philosophy — The Babylonian Job — The Babylonian</p>
<p>Koheleth — An anti-clerical</p>
<p>A nation is bom stoic, and dies epicurean. At its cradle (to repeat
a</p>
<p>thoughtful adage) religion stands, and philosophy accompanies it to
the grave. In the beginning of all cultures a strong religious faith
conceals and softens the nature of things, and gives men courage to bear
pain and hard- ship patiently; at every step the gods are with them, and
will not let them perish, until they do. Even then a firm faith will
explain that it was the sins of the people that turned their gods to an
avenging wrath; evil</p>
<p>does not destroy faith, but strengthens it. If victory comes, if war
is for- gotten in security and peace, then wealth grows; the life of the
body gives way, in the dominant classes, to the life of the senses and
the mind; toil and suffering are replaced by pleasure and ease; science
weakens faith even while thought and comfort weaken virility and
fortitude. At last men begin to doubt the gods; they mourn the tragedy
of knowledge, and seek refuge in every passing delight. Achilles is at
the beginning, Epicurus at the end. After David comes Job, and after
Job, Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>Since we know the thought of Babylon mostly from the later reigns, it
is natural that we should find it shot through with the weary wisdom of
tired philosophers who took their pleasures like Englishmen. On one
tablet Balta-atrua complains that though he has obeyed the commands of
the gods more strictly than any one else, he has been laid low with a
variety of misfortunes; he has lost his parents and his property, and
even the little that remained to him has been stolen on the highway.
His</p>
<p>friends, like Job’s, reply that his disaster must be in punishment of
some secret sin — perhaps that hybris, or insolent pride of prosperity,
which</p>
<p>l6o THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xparticularly arouses the jealous anger of the gods. They assure him
that evil is merely good in disguise, some part of the divine plan seen
too narrowly by frail minds unconscious of the whole. Let Balta-atrua
keep faith and courage, and he will be rewarded in the end; better
still, his enemies will be punished. Balta-atrua calls out to the gods
for help — and the fragment suddenly ends . 162</p>
<p>Another poem, found among the ruins of Ashurbanipal’s collection of
Babylonian literature, presents the same problem more definitely in the
person of Tabi-utul-Enlil, who appears to have been a ruler in Nippur.
He describes his difficulties:*</p>
<p>(My eyeballs he obscured, bolting them as with) a lock;</p>

<p>A king, I have been changed into a slave;</p>

<p>He goes on to tell what a pious fellow he has always been, the very
last man in the world who should have met with so cruel a fate:</p>
<p>As though I had not always set aside the portion for the god,</p>
<p>And had not invoked the goddess at the meal,</p>
<p>Had not bowed my face and brought my tribute;</p>
<p>As though I were one in whose mouth supplication and prayer were not
constant! . . .</p>
<p>I taught my country to guard the name of the god;</p>
<p>To honor the name of the goddess I accustomed my people. . . .</p>
<p>I thought that such things were pleasing to a god.</p>
<p>Stricken with disease despite all this formal piety, he muses on
the</p>
<p>impossibility of understanding the gods, and on the uncertainty of
human affairs.</p>
<p>Who is there that can grasp the will of the gods in heaven?</p>
<p>The plan of a god full of mystery — who can understand it? . . .</p>
<p>He who was alive yesterday is dead today;</p>
<p>In an instant he is cast into grief; of a sudden he is crushed.</p>

<p>In a twinkling he wails like a mourner. . . .</p>
<p>Like a net trouble has covered me.</p>
<p>My eyes look but see not;</p>
<p>My ears are open but they hear not. . . .</p>
<p>Pollution has fallen upon my genitals,</p>
<p>And it has assailed the glands in my bowels. . . .</p>

<p>Like Job, he makes another act of faith:</p>
<p>But I know the day of the cessation of my tears,</p>
<p>A day of the grace of the protecting spirits; then divinity will
be</p>
<p>merciful . 163</p>
<p>In the end everything turns out happily. A spirit appears, and cures
all of Tabi’s ailments; a mighty storm drives all the demons of disease
out of his frame. He praises Marduk, offers rich sacrifice, and calls
upon every one never to despair of the gods.*</p>
<p>As there is but a step from this to the Book of Job , so we find in
late Babylonian literature unmistakable premonitions of Ecclesiastes. In
the Epic of Gilgamesh the goddess Sabitu advises the hero to give up his
longing for a life after death, and to eat, drink and be merry on
the</p>
<p>earth.</p>
<p>O Gilgamesh, why dost thou run in all directions?</p>
<p>The life that thou seekest thou wilt not find.</p>
<p>When the gods created mankind they determined death for mankind;</p>
<p>Life they kept in their own hands.</p>
<p>Thou, O Gilgamesh, fill thy belly;</p>
<p>Day and night be thou merry; . . .</p>
<p>Day and night be joyous and content!</p>
<p>Let thy garments be pure,</p>

in Sumeria, influ- enced the author of the Book of Job. 1Qi</li>

<p>Regard the little one who takes hold of thy hand;</p>
<p>Enjoy the wife in thy bosom. 106 *</p>
<p>In another tablet we hear a bitterer note, culminating in atheism and
blasphemy. Gubarru, a Babylonian Alcibiades, . interrogates an elder
sceptically:</p>
<p>O very wise one, O possessor of intelligence, let thy heart
groan!</p>
<p>The heart of God is as far as the inner parts of the heavens.</p>
<p>Wisdom is hard, and men do not understand it.</p>
<p>To which the old man answers with a forboding of Amos and Isaiah:</p>
<p>Give attention, my friend, and understand my thought.</p>
<p>Men exalt the work of the great man who is skilled in murder.</p>
<p>They disparage the poor man who has done no sin.</p>
<p>They justify the wicked man, whose fault is grave.</p>
<p>They drive away the just man who seeks the will of God.</p>
<p>They let the strong take the food of the poor;</p>
<p>They strengthen the mighty;</p>
<p>They destroy the weak man, the rich man drives him away.</p>
<p>He advises Gubarru to do the will of the gods none the less. But
Gubarru will have nothing to do with gods or priests who are always on
the side of the biggest fortunes:</p>
<p>They have offered lies and untruth without ceasing.</p>
<p>They say in noble words what is in favor of the rich man.</p>
<p>Is his wealth diminished? They come to his help.</p>
<p>They ill-treat the weak man like a thief,</p>
<p>They destroy him in a tremor, they extinguish him like a flame .
100</p>
<p>We must not exaggerate the prevalence of such moods in Babylon;</p>
<p>doubtless the people listened lovingly to their priests, and crowded
the temples to seek favors of the gods. The marvel is that they were so
long</p>
<ul>
<li>Cf. Ecclesiastes , ix, 7- 9: “Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy,
and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest, all the days of the life
of thy vanity.”</li>

<p>loyal to a religion that offered them so little consolation. Nothing
could be known, said the ’priests, except by divine revelation; and this
revela- tion came only through the priests. The last chapter of that
revelation told how the dead soul, whether good or bad, descended into
Aralu, or Hades, to spend there an eternity in darkness and suffering.
Is it any wonder that Babylon gave itself to revelry, while
Nebuchadrezzar, having all, understanding nothing, fearing everything,
went mad?</p>
<p>X. EPITAPH</p>
<p>Tradition and the Book of Daniel, unverified by any document known to
us, tell how Nebuchadrezzar, after a long reign of uninterrupted vic-
tory and prosperity, after beautifying his city with roads and palaces,
and erecting fifty-four temples to the gods, fell into a strange
insanity, thought himself a beast, walked on all fours, and ate grass. 1
“ For four years his name disappears from the history and governmental
records of Babylonia; 1 “ it reappears for a moment, and then, in 562
b.c., he passes away.</p>
<p>Within thirty years after his death his empire crumbled to
pieces.</p>
<p>Nabonidus, who held the throne for seventeen years, preferred
archeology to government, and devoted himself to excavating the
antiquities of Sumeria while his own realm was going to ruin. 11 “’ The
army fell into disorder; business men forgot love of country in the
sublime internation- alism of finance; the people, busy with trade and
pleasure, unlearned the arts of war. The priests usurped more and more
of the royal power, and fattened their treasuries with wealth that
tempted invasion and conquest. When Cyrus and his disciplined Persians
stood at the gates, the anti- clericals of Babylon connived to open the
city to him, and welcomed his enlightened domination. 110 For two
centuries Persia ruled Babylonia as part of the greatest empire that
history had yet known. Then , the exub- erant Alexander came, captured
the unresisting capital, conquered all the Near East, and drank himself
to death in the palace of Nebuchadrezzar. 1”</p>
<p>The civilization of Babylonia was not as fruitful for humanity as</p>
<p>Egypt’s, not as varied and profound as India’s, not as subtle and
mature as China’s. And yet it was froth Babylonia that those fascinating
legends came which, through the literary artistry of the Jews, became an
insep- arable portion of Europe’s religious lore; i t was from
Babylonia, rather than from Egypt, that the roving Greeks brought to
their city-states.</p>

<p>and thence to Rome and ourselves, the foundations of mathematics,
astronomy, medicine, grammar, lexicography, archeology, history, and
philosophy. The Greek names for the metals and the constellations, for
weights and measures, for musical instruments and many drugs, are trans-
lations, sometimes mere transliterations, of Babylonian names. 1 ” While
Greek architecture derived its forms and inspiration from Egypt and
Crete, Babylonian architecture, through the ziggurat, led to the towers
of Moslem mosques, the steeples and campaniles of medieval art, and the
“setback” style of contemporary architecture in Am erica. The laws of
Hammurabi became for all ancient societies a legacy comparable to Rome’s
gift of order and government to the modern world. Through Assyria’s
conquest of Babylon, her appropriation of the ancient city’s culture,
and her dissemination of that culture throughout her wide em- pire;
through the long Captivity of the Jews, and the great influence upon
them of Babylonian life and thought; through the Persian and Greek con-
quests, which opened with unprecedented fulness and freedom all the
roads of communication and trade between Babylon and the rising cities
of Ionia, Asia Minor and Greece — through these and many other ways the
civilization of the Land between the Rivers passed down into the
cultural endowment of our race. In the end nothing is lost; for good or
evil every event has effects forever.</p>
