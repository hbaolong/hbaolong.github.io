<h4 id="chapter-iv-the-golden-age">CHAPTER IV The Golden Age</h4>
<p>1464-92</p>
<p>I. PIERO “iL GOTTOSO”</p>
<p>C OSIMO’S son Piero, aged fifty, succeeded to his wealth, his
authority, and his gout. Even from boyhood this disease of the
prosperous had afflicted Piero, so that his contemporaries, to
distinguish him from other Peters, called him II Gottoso. He was a man
of fair ability and good morals; he had performed reasonably well some
diplomatic missions entrusted to him by his father; he was generous to
his friends, to literature, religion, and art; but he lacked Cosimo’s
intelligence, geniality, and tact. To cement - velli, “they adopted as
their ensign to give their purpose a graceful cover - ing.” 1 For a
brief interval they controlled the government; but the Medi - cean party
soon recaptured it; and Piero continued a troubled reign until his death
(1469).</p>
<p>He left two sons, Lorenzo aged twenty, Giuliano sixteen. Florence</p>
<p>could not believe that such youths could successfully direct the
business of their family, much less the affairs of the state. Some
citizens demanded the restoration of the Republic in fact as well as
form; and many feared a generation of chaos and civil war. Lorenzo
surprised them.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE DEVELOPMENT OF LORENZO</li>
</ol>
<p>Noting Piero’s ill health, Cosimo had done his best to prepare
Lorenzo for the tasks of power. The boy had learned Greek from Joannes
Argyro- poulos, philosophy from Ficino, and he had absorbed education
uncon- sciously by hearing the conversation of statesmen, poets,
artists, and hu- manists. He learned also the arts of war, and at
nineteen, in a tournament displaying the sons of Florence’s leading
families, he won the first prize “not by favor, but by his own valor.” 2
On his armor, in that contest, was</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>a French motto, Le temps revient, which might have been the theme of
the Renaissance — “The [Golden] Age returns.” Meanwhile he had taken to
writing sonnets in the style of Dante and Petrarch; and bound by fashion
to write of love, he sought among the aristocracy some lady whom he
might poetically desire. He chose Lucrezia Donati, and celebrated all
her virtues except her regrettable chastity; for she seems never to have
allowed more than the passions of the pen. Piero, thinking marriage a
sure cure for romance, persuaded the youth to wed Clarice Orsini (1469),
thus allying the Medici with one of the two most powerful families in
Rome. On that occasion the entire city was feasted by the Medici for
three successive days, and five thousand pounds of sweetmeats were
consumed.</p>
<p>Cosimo had given the lad some practice in public affairs, and Piero,
in power, widened the range of his responsibilities in finance and
govern- ment. When Piero died Lorenzo found himself the richest man in
Florence, perhaps in Italy. The management of his fortune and his
business might have been a sufficient burden for his young shoulders,
and the Republic had now a chance to reassert its authority. But the
clients, debtors, friends, and appointees of the Medici were so
numerous, and so anxious for the continuance of Medicean rule, that, two
days after Piero’s death, a depu - tation of leading citizens waited
upon Lorenzo at his home, and asked him to assume the guidance of the
state. He was not hard to convince. The finances of the Medici firm were
so entangled with those of the city that he feared ruin if the enemies
or rivals of his house should capture political power. To quiet
criticism of his youth, he appointed a council of experi- enced citizens
to advise him on all matters of major concern. He consulted this council
throughout his career, but he soon showed such good judgment that it
rarely questioned his leadership. He offered his younger brother a
generous share of power; but Giuliano loved music and poetry, jousts and
love; he admired Lorenzo, and gladly resigned to him the cares and
honors of government. Lorenzo ruled as Cosimo and Piero had ruled,
remaining (till 1490) a private citizen, but recommending policies to a
balia in which the supporters of his house had a secure majority. The
balia, under the constitution, had absolute but only temporary power;
under the Medici it became a permanent Council of Seventy.</p>
<p>The citizens acquiesced because prosperity continued. When Galeazzo
Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, visited Florence in 1471, he was amazed at
the signs of wealth in the city, and still more at the art that Cosimo,
Piero, and Lorenzo had gathered in the Medici palace and gardens. Here
already was a museum of statuary, vases, gems, paintings, illuminated
manuscripts,</p>
<p>1 12</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>and architectural remains. Galeazzo averred that he had seen a
greater number of fine paintings in this one collection than in all the
rest of Italy; so far had Florence forged ahead in this characteristic
art of the Renais- sance. The Medici fortunes were further enhanced when
(1471) Lorenzo led a delegation of Florentines to Rome to congratulate
Sixtus IV on his elevation to the papacy; Sixtus responded by renewing
the Medici man- agement of the papal finances. Five years earlier Piero
had obtained for his house the lucrative right to develop the papal
mines near Civitavecchia, which produced the precious alum used in
dyeing and finishing cloth.</p>
<p>Soon after his return from Rome Lorenzo met, not too successfully,
his first major crisis. An alum mine in the district of Volterra — a
part of the Florentine dominion — had been leased to private contractors
probably con- nected with the Medici. When it proved extremely lucrative
the citizens of Volterra claimed a share of the profits for their
municipal revenue. The contractors protested, and appealed to the
Florentine Signory; the Signory doubled the problem by decreeing that
the profits should go to the general treasury of the whole Florentine
state. Volterra denounced the decree, declared its independence, and put
to death several citizens who opposed the secession. In the Council of
Florence Tommaso Soderini recommended conciliatory measures; Lorenzo
rejected them on the ground that they would encourage insurrection and
secession elsewhere. His advice was taken, the revolt was suppressed by
force, and the Florentine mercenaries, getting out of hand, sacked the
rebellious city. Lorenzo hurried down to Volterra and labored to restore
order and make amends, but the affair re- mained a blot on his
record.</p>
<p>The Florentines readily forgave his severity to Volterra, and they
ap- plauded the energy with which, in 1472, he averted famine in the
city by quickly securing heavy imports of grain. They were happy, too,
when Lorenzo arranged a triple alliance with Venice and Milan to
preserve the peace of northern Italy. Pope Sixtus was not so well
pleased; the papacy could never be comfortable in its weak temporal
power if a strong and united northern Italy bounded the Papal States on
one side, and an extensive Kingdom of Naples hedged it in on the other.
When Sixtus learned that Florence was trying to purchase the town and
territory of Imola (between Bologna and Ravenna), he suspected Lorenzo
of planning to extend</p>
<p>Florentine territory to the Adriatic. Sixtus himself soon bought
Imola as a necessary link in the chain of cities legally — seldom
actually — subject to the popes. In this transaction he used the
services and funds of the Pazzi banking firm, now the strongest rival of
the Medici; he transferred from</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>“3</p>
<p>Lorenzo to the Pazzi the lucrative privilege of managing the papal
revenues; and he appointed two enemies of the Medici — Girolamo Riario
and Francesco Salviati — to be respectively governor of Imola and
archbishop of Pisa, then a Florentine possession. Lorenzo reacted with
an angry haste that Cosimo would have deplored: he took measures to ruin
the Pazzi firm, and he ordered Pisa to exclude Salviati from its
episcopal see. The Pope was so enraged that he gave his consent to a
plot of the Pazzi, Riario, and Salviati to overthrow Lorenzo; he refused
to sanction the assassination of the youth, but the conspirators did not
consider such squeamishness an im- pediment. With remarkable
indifference to religious propriety, they planned to kill Lorenzo and
Giuliano at Mass in the cathedral on Easter Sunday (April 26, 1478), at
the moment when the priest should elevate the Host. At the same time
Salviati and others were to seize the Palazzo Vecchio and eject the
Signory.</p>
<p>On the appointed day Lorenzo entered the cathedral unarmed and un-
guarded, as was his wont. Giuliano was delayed, but Francesco de’ Pazzi
and Bernardo Bandini, who had undertaken to murder him, went to his
house, amused him with jests, and persuaded him to come to the church.
There, as the priest raised the Host, Bandini stabbed Giuliano in the
breast. Giuliano fell to the ground, and Francesco de’ Pazzi, leaping
upon him, stabbed him repeatedly and with such fury that he severely cut
his own leg. Meanwhile Antonio da Volterra and Stefano, a priest,
attacked</p>
<p>Lorenzo with their daggers. He protected himself with his arms, and
re- ceived but a slight cut; friends surrounded him and led him into a
sacristy, while his assailants fled from the hostile crowd. Giuliano was
carried dead to the Medici palace.</p>
<p>While these ceremonies were taking place in the cathedral, Archbishop
Salviati, Iacopo de’ Pazzi, and a hundred armed followers procee ded
against the Palazzo Vecchio. They tried to rouse the populace to their
aid by shouting Popolo! Liberta! But the people, in this crisis, rallied
to the Medici with the cry, Vivano le pallet — ‘hong live the balls!”—
the emblem of the Medici family. When Salviati entered the palace he was
struck down by the gonfalonier Cesare Petrucci; Iacopo di Poggio, son of
the humanist, was hanged from a palace window; and several other
conspirators, who had climbed the stairs, were seized by the resolute
priors and were thrown out of the windows to be finished by the stone
pavement or the crowd. When Lorenzo appeared, now with a numerous
escort, the joy of the people at his safety expressed itself in violent
rage against all who were suspected of sharing in the conspiracy.
Francesco de’ Pazzi, weak from loss of blood.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>1 1 4</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>was snatched from his bed and hanged beside the Archbishop, who
gnawed at Francesco’s shoulder in his dying agony. The body of Iacopo
de’ Pazzi, the old honored head of his family, was drawn naked through
the streets and flung into the Arno. Lorenzo did what he could to
mitigate the blood- thirst of the mob, and saved several men unjustly
accused; but instincts stealthily latent even in civilized men could not
forego this opportunity of safe expression in the anonymity of the
crowd.</p>
<p>Sixtus IV, shocked by the hanging of an archbishop, excommunicated
Lorenzo, the gonfalonier, and the magistrates of Florence, and suspended
all religious services throughout the Florentine dominions. Some of the
clergy protested against this interdict, and issued a document
condemning the Pope in terms of unmeasured vituperation. 3 At Sixtus’
suggestion Fer - rante — King Ferdinand I — of Naples sent an envoy to
Florence, urging the Signory and the citizens to deliver up Lorenzo to
the Pope, or at least to banish him. Lorenzo advised the Signory to
comply; instead it answered Ferdinand that Florence would suffer every
extremity rather than betray its leader to his enemies. Sixtus and
Ferrante now declared war upon Florence (1479). The King’s son Alfonso
defeated the Florentine army near Poggibonsi, and ravaged the
countryside.</p>
<p>Soon the people of Florence began to complain of the taxes levied to
finance the campaign, and Lorenzo realized that no community will long
sacrifice itself for an individual. He made a characteristic and
unprece- dented decision in this turning point of his career. Embarking
at Pisa, he sailed to Naples, and asked to be taken to the King.
Ferrante admired his courage; the two men were at war; Lorenzo had no
safe-conduct, no weapons, no guard; only recently the condottiere
Francesco Piccinino, invited to Naples as guest of the King, had been
treacherously murdered at the royal command. Lorenzo frankly admitted
the difficulties that Florence faced; but he pointed out how dangerous
it would be to Naples that the papacy should be so strengthened by the
dismemberment of the Florentine dominions as then to be able to press
its old claim upon Naples as a papal and tributary fief. The Turks were
advancing westward by land and sea; they might at any moment invade
Italy, and attack Ferrante’s Adriatic provinces; it would not do, in
that crisis, for Italy to be divided with internal hate and war.
Ferrante did not commit himself, but he gave orders that Lorenzo should
be detained as both a prisoner and an honored guest.</p>
<p>Lorenzo’s mission was made more difficult by the continued victories
of Alfonso against the Florentine troops, and by the repeated request of
Sixtus</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>hat Lorenzo should be sent to Rome as a papal prisoner. For three
months the Florentine was kept in suspense, knowing that failure
probably meant his death and an end to the independence of Florence.
Meanwhile he made friends by his hospitality and generosity, his good
manners and good cheer. Count Caraffa, minister of state, was won over,
and supported his cause. Ferrante appreciated the culture and character
of his prisoner; here, appar- ently, was a man of refinement and
integrity; peace made with such a man would assure the friendship of
Florence for Naples through at least Lo- renzo’s life. He signed a
treaty with him, gave him a splendid horse, and allowed him to take ship
from Naples. When Florence learned that Lorenzo brought peace it gave
him a grateful and tumultuous welcome. Sixtus raged, and wished to
continue the war alone; but when Mohammed II, the conqueror of
Constantinople, landed an army at Otranto (1480), and threatened to
overrun Italy and capture the very citadel of Latin Christi- anity,
Sixtus invited the Florentines to discuss terms. Their envoys made the
due obeisances to the Pope; he scolded them properly, forgave them,
persuaded them to equip fifteen galleys against the Turks, and made
peace. From that time forward Lorenzo was the unchallenged lord of
Tuscany.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT</li>
</ol>
<p>He ruled now with a milder hand than in his youth. He had just
entered the thirties, but men matured quickly in the hothouse of the
Renaissance. He was not handsome: his large flat nose overhung his upper
lip and then turned outward curiously; his complexion was dark; and his
stern brow and heavy jaw belied the geniality of his spirit, the charm
of his courtesy, the vivacity of his wit, the poetic sensitivity of his
mind. Tall, broad-shoul- dered, and robust, he looked more like an
athlete than a statesman; and in- deed he was seldom surpassed in
physical games. He carried himself with the moderate dignity
indispensable to his station, but in private he made his many friends
immediately forget his power and his wealth. Like his son Leo X he
enjoyed the subtlest art and the simplest buffoons. He was a humorist
with Pulci, a poet with Politian, a scholar with Landino, a phi-
losopher with Ficino, a mystic with Pico, an esthete with Botticelli, a
musician with Squarcialupi, a reveler with the gayest in festival time.
“When my mind is disturbed with the tumults of public business,” he
wrote to Ficino , “and my ears are stunned with the clamors of turbulent
citizens, how could I support such contention unless I found relaxation
in science?”— by which he meant the pursuit of knowledge in all its
forms. 4</p>
<p>Il6 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>His morals were not as exemplary as his mind. Like many of his con-
temporaries he did not allow his religious faith to hamper his enjoyment
of life. He wrote devout hymns with apparent sincerity, but turned from
them, without evident qualm, to poems celebrating licentious love. He
seems rarely to have known remorse except for pleasures missed. Having
reluctantly accepted, for political reasons, a wife whom he respected
rather than loved, he amused himself with adultery after the fashion of
the time. But it was accounted one of his distinctions that he had no
illegitimate children. Debate is still warm as to his commercial
morality. No one ques- tions his liberality; it was as lavish as
Cosimo’s. He never rested till he had repaid every gift with a greater
gift; he financed a dozen religious under- takings, supported countless
artists, scholars, and poets, and lent great sums to the state. After
the Pazzi conspiracy he found that his public and private disbursements
had left his firm unable to meet its obligations; whereupon a
complaisant Council voted to pay his debts out of the state treasury
(1480). It is not clear whether this was a fair return for services
rendered and private funds spent for public purposes, 5 or a plain
embezzlement; 6 the fact tha t the measure, though openly known, did no
harm to Lorenzo’s popu - larity, suggests the more lenient
interpretation. It was his liberality, as well as his wealth and his
luxurious menage, that men had in mind when they called him 11
Magnifico.</p>
<p>His cultural activities involved some neglect of the far-flung
business of his firm. His agents took advantage of his preoccupation,
and indulged in extravagance and chicanery. He rescued the family
fortune by gradually withdrawing it from commerce and investing it in
city realty and large- scale agriculture; he took pleasure in personally
supervising his farms and orchards, and was as familiar with fertilizer
as with philosophy. Scientifi- cally irrigated and manured, the lands
near his villas at Careggi and</p>
<p>Poggio a Caiano became models of agricultural economy.</p>
<p>The economic life of Florence prospered under his government. 7 The
rate of interest fell as low as five per cent, and commercial
enterprise, readily financed, flourished until, toward the close of
Lorenzo’s career, England became a troublesome competitor in the textile
export trade. Even more conducive to prosperity was his policy of peace,
and the balance of power that he maintained in Italy during the second
decade of his rule. Florence joined with other Italian states in
ejecting the Turks from Italy; this accomplished, Lorenzo induced
Ferrante of Naples and Galeazzo Sforza of Milan to sign with Florence an
alliance for mutual defense; when Pope Innocent VIII joined this league
most of the minor states adhered to</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>II?</p>
<p>it too; Venice held aloof, but was persuaded to good behavior by fear
of the allies; in this way, with some minor interruptions, the peace of
Italy was maintained until Lorenzo’s death. Meanwhile he exerted all his
tact and influence to protect weak states against the strong, to
adjudicate and reconcile interstate interests and disputes, and to nip
every casus belli in the bud. 8 In that happy decade (1480-90) Florence
reached the apogee of her glory in politics, literature, and art.</p>
<p>Domestically Lorenzo ruled through the Consiglio di Settanta. By the
constitution of 1480 this Council of Seventy was composed of thirty mem-
bers chosen by the Signory of that year, and forty others chosen by
these thirty. Membership was for life, and vacancies were filled by
co-optation. Under this arrangement the Signory and the gonfalonier had
authority only as executive agents of the Council. Popular parlamenti
and elections were dispensed with. Opposition was difficult, for Lorenzo
employed spies to detect it, and had means of troubling his opponents
financially. The old factions slept; crime hid its head; order prospered
while liberty declined. “We have here,” wrote a contemporary, “no ro
bberies, no nocturnal com- motions, no assassinations. By night or by
day every person may transact his affairs in perfect safety.”® “If
Florence was to have a tyrant,” said Guicciardini, “she could never have
found a better or more delightful one.” 10 The merchants preferred
economic prosperity to political freedom; the proletariat was kept busy
with extensive public works, and forgave dictatorship so long as Lorenzo
supplied it with bread and games. Tourna- ments allured the rich, horse
races thrilled the bourgeoisie, and pageants amused the populace.</p>
<p>It was the custom of the Florentines, in carnival days, to promenade
the streets in gay or frightful masks, singing satiric or erotic songs,
and to or- ganize trionfi — parades of painted and garlanded floats
representing mytho- logical or historical characters or events. Lorenzo
relished the custom, but distrusted its tendency to disorder; he
resolved to bring it under control by lending it the approval and order
of government; under his rule the pag- eants became the most popular
feature of Florentine life. He engaged lead- ing artists to design and
paint the chariots, banners, and costumes; he and his friends composed
lyrics to be sung from the carri; and these songs re- flected the moral
relaxation of carnival. The most famous of Lorenzo’s pageants was the
“Triumph of Bacchus,” wherein a procession of floats carrying lovely
maidens, and a cavalcade of richly garbed youths on</p>
<p>prancing steeds, came over the Ponte Vecchio to the spacious square
before the cathedral, while voices in polyphonic harmony, to the
accompaniment</p>

<p>Such poems and pageants lend some pale color to the charge that
Lorenzo corrupted Florentine youth. Probably it would have been
“corrupt” with - out him; morals in Venice, Ferrara, and Milan were no
better than in Florence; they were better in Florence under the Medici
bankers than later in Rome under the Medici popes.</p>
<p>Lorenzo’s esthetic sensibilities were too keen for his morals. Poetry
was one of his prime devotions, and his compositions rivaled the best of
his time. While his only superior, Politian, still hesitated between
Latin and Italian, Lorenzo’s verses restored to the vernacular the
literary primacy that Dante had established and the humanists had
overthrown. He preferred Petrarch’s</p>

<p>CHAP, rv)</p>
<p>U 9</p>
<p>piety. But his most characteristic poems were the Canti camas dales
chi — Carnival Songs — written to be sung in festival time and mood, and
express- ing the legitimacy of pleasure and the discourtesy of maidenly
prudence. Nothing could better illustrate the morals and manners, the
complexity and diversity of the Italian Renaissance than the picture of
its most central character ruling a state, managing a fortune, jousting
in tournament, writ- ing excellent poetry, supporting artists and
authors with discriminating patronage, mingling at ease with scholars
and philosophers, peasants and buffoons, marching in pageants, singing
bawdy songs, composing tender hymns, playing with mistresses, begetting
a pope, and honored throughout Europe as the greatest and noblest
Italian of his time.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>LITERATURE: THE AGE OF POLITIAN</li>
</ol>
<p>Encouraged by his aid and example, Florentine men of leters now wrote
more and more of their works in Italian. Slowly they formed that
literary Tuscan which became the model and standard of the whole
peninsula — “the sweetest, riches t, and most cultured, not only of all
the languages of Italy,” said the patriotic Varchi, “but of all the
tongues that are known</p>
<p>But while reviving Italian literature, Lorenzo carried on zealously
his grandfather’s enterprise of gathering f or the use of scholars in
Florence all the classics of Greece and Rome. He sent Politian and John
Lascaris to various cities in Italy and abroad to buy manuscripts; from
one monastery at Mt. Athos Lascaris brought two hundred, of which eighty
were as yet unknown to Western Europe. According to Politian, Lorenzo
wished that he might be allowed to spend his entire fortune, even to
pledge his furni- ture, in the purchase of books. He paid scribes to
make copies for him of manuscripts that could not be purchased, and in
return he allowed other collectors, like King Matthias Corvinus of
Hungary and Duke Federigo of Urbino, to send their copyists to
transcribe manuscripts in the Medicean Library. After Lorenzo’s death
this collection was united with that which Cosimo had placed in the
convent of San Marco; together, in 1495, they included 1039 volumes, of
which 460 were Greek. Michelangelo later de- signed a lordly home for
these books, and posterity gave it Lorenzo’s name — Bibliotheca
Laurentiana, the Laurentian Library. When Bernardo Cen- nini set up a
printing press in Florence (1471) Lorenzo did not, like his friend
Politian or Federigo of Urbino, turn up his nose at the new art; he
seems to have recognized at once the revolutionary possibilities of
movable</p>
<p>zo</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap, rv</p>
<p>ype; and he engaged scholars to collate diverse texts in order that
the classics might be printed with the greatest accuracy possible at
that time. So encouraged, Bartolommeo di Libri printed the editio
princeps of Homer (1488) under the careful scholarship of Demetrius
Chalcondyles; John Lascaris issued the editiones principes of Euripides
(1494), the Greek Anthology (1494), and Lucian (1496); and Cristoforo
Landino edited</p>
<p>Horace (1482), Virgil, Pliny the Elder, and Dante, whose language and
allusions already required elucidation. We catch the spirit of the time
when we learn that Florence rewarded Cristoforo, for these labors of
scholarship, with the gift of a splendid home.</p>
<p>Lured by the reputation of the Medici and other Florentines for
generous patronage, scholars flocked to Florence and made it the capital
of literary learning. Vespasiano da Bisticci, after serving as
bookseller and librarian at Florence, Urbino, and Rome, composed an
eloquent but judicious series of Lives of Illustrious Men ,
commemorating the writers and patrons of the age. To develop and
transmit the intellectual legacy of the race Lorenzo restored and
enlarged the old University of Pisa, and the Platonic Academy at
Florence. The latter was no formal college but an association of men
interested in Plato, meeting at irregular intervals in Lorenzo’s city
palace or in Ficino’s villa at Careggi, dining together, reading aloud
part or all of a Platonic dialogue, and discussing its philosophy.
November 7, the sup- posed anniversary of Plato’s birth and death, was
celebrated by the Acad - emy with almost religious solemnity; a bust
believed to be of Plato was crowned with flowers, and a lamp was burned
before it as before the image of a deity. Cristoforo Landino used these
meetings as the basis for the imaginary conversations that he wrote as
Disputationes Camaldulenses (1468). He told how he and his brother,
visiting the monastery of the Camaldulese monks, met th e young Lorenzo
and Giuliano de’ Medici, Leon Battista Alberti, and six other Florentine
gentlemen; how they re- clined on the grass near a flowing fountain,
compared the worried hurry of the city with the healing quiet of the
countryside, and debated the active versus the contemplative career, and
how Alberti praised a life of rural meditation, while Lorenzo urged that
the mature mind finds its fullest functioning and satisfaction in the
service of the state and the commerce of the world. 13</p>
<p>Among those who attended the discussions of the Platonic Academy were
Politian, Pico della Mirandola, Michelangelo, and Marsilio Ficino.
Marsilio had been so faithful to Cosimo’s commission as to devote almost
all his life to translating Plato into Latin and to studying, teaching,
and</p>

<p>I 2 I</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>writing about Platonism. In youth he was so handsome that the maidens
of Florence eyed him possessively, but he cared less for them than for
his books. For a time he lost his religious faith; Platonism seemed
superior; he addressed his students as “beloved in Plato” rather than
“beloved in Christ”; 14 he burned candles before a bust of Plato, and
adored him as a saint. 15 Christianity appeared to him, in this mood, as
but one of the many religions that hid elements of truth behind their
allegorical dogmas and symbolic rites. St. Augustine’s writings, and
gratitude for recovery from a critical illness, won him back to the
Christian faith. At forty he became a priest, but he remained an
enthusiastic Platonist. Socrates and Plato, he argued, had expounded a
monotheism as noble as that of the Prophets; they, too, in their minor
way, had received a divine revelation; so, indeed, had all men in whom
reason ruled. Following his lead, Lorenzo and most of the humanists
sought not to replace Christianity with another faith, but to
reinterpret it in terms that a philosopher could accept. For a
generation or two (1447-1534) the Church smiled tolerantly on the
enterprise.</p>
<p>Savonarola denounced it as humbug.</p>
<p>Next to Lorenzo himself, Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola was the
most fascinating personality in the Platonic Academy. Born in the town
(near Modena) made famous by his name, he studied at Bologna and Paris,
and was received with honor at almost every court in Europe; finally
Lorenzo persuaded him to make Florence his home. His eager mind took up
one study after another — poetry, philosophy, architecture, music — and
achieved in each some outstanding excellence. Politian described him as
a paragon in wbom Nature had united all her gifts: “tall and finely
molded, with something of divinity shining in his face”; a man of
penetrating glance, indefatigable study, miraculous memory, and
ecumenical erudition, elo- quent in several languages, a favorite with
women and philosophers, and as lovable in character as he was handsome
in person and eminent in all quali- ties of intellect. His mind was open
to every philosophy and every faith; he could not find it in him to
reject any system, any man; and though in his final years he spurned
astrology, he welcomed mysticism and magic as readily as he accepted
Plato and Christ. He had a good word to say for the Scholastic
philosophers, whom most other humanists repudiated as having barbarously
expressed absurdities. He found much to admire in Arabic and Jewish
thought, and numbered several Jews among his teachers and honored
friends. 10 He studied the Hebrew Cabala, innocently accepted its
alleged antiquity, and announced that he had found in it full proofs for
the divinity of Christ. As one of his feudal titles was Count of
Concordia,</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>he assumed the high duty of reconciling all the great religions of
the West — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — arid these with Plato, and
Plato with Aristotle. Though flattered by all, he retained to the end of
his brief life a charming modesty that was impaired only by his
ingenuous trust in the accuracy of his learning and the power of human
reason.</p>
<p>Going to Rome at the age of twenty-four (i486), he startled priests
and pundits by publishing a list of nine hundred propositions, covering
logic, metaphysics, theology, ethics, mathematics, physics, magic, and
the Cabala, and including the generous heresy that even the greatest
mortal sin, being finite, could not merit eternal punishment. Pico
proclaimed his readiness to defend any or all of these propositions in
public debate against any per- son, and offered to pay the traveling
expenses of any challenger from what- ever land he might come. As a
preface to this proposed tournament of philosophy he prepared a famous
oration, later entitled De hominis dignitate (On the Dignity of Man ) ,
which expressed with youthful ardor the high opinion that the humanists
— contradicting most medieval views — held of the human species. “It is
a commonplace of the schools,” wrote Pico, “that man is a little world,
in which we may discern a body mingled of earthly elements, and a
heavenly spirit, and the vegetable soul of plants, and the senses of the
lower animals, and reason, and the mind of angels, and the likeness of
God.” 17 And then Pico put into the mouth of God Himself, as words
spoken to Adam, a divine testimony to the limitless potentialities of
man: “I created thee as being neither heavenly nor earthly… that thou
mightest be free to shape and to overcome thyself. Thou mayest sink into
a beast, or be born anew to the divine likeness.” To which Pico added,
in the high spirit of the young Renaissance:</p>
<p>This is the culminating gift of God, this is the supreme and</p>
<p>marvelous felicity of man… that he can be that which he wills to</p>
<p>be. Animals, from the moment of their birth, carry with them,
from</p>
<p>heir mothers’ bodies, all that they are destined to have or be;
the</p>
<p>highest spirits [angels] are from the beginning… what they will
be</p>
<p>forever. But God the Father endowed man, from birth, with the</p>
<p>seeds of every possibility and every life. 18</p>
<p>No one cared to accept Pico’s multifarious challenge , but Pope Inno-
cent VIII condemned three of the propositions as heretical. Since these
formed so tiny a proportion of the whole, Pico might have expected
mercy, and indeed, Innocent did not press the matter. But Pico issued a
cautious retraction, and departed for Paris, where the University
offered him pro-</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>1*3</p>
<p>ection. In 1493 Alexander VI, with his wonted geniality, notified
Pico that all was forgiven. Back in Florence Pico became a devout
follower of Savonarola, abandoned his pursuit of omniscience, burned his
five volumes of love poetry, gave his fortune to provide marriage
dowries for poor girls, and himself adopted a semimonastic life. He
thought of joining the</p>
<p>Dominican order, but died before he could make up his mind — still a
youth of thirty-one. His influence survived his brief career, and
inspired Reuch- lin to continue, in Germany, those Hebrew studies which
had been among the passions of Pico’s life.</p>
<p>Politian, who admired Pico generously, and corrected his poetry with
the most gracious apologies, was a man of less meteoric lure, but of
deeper penetration and more substantial accomplishment. Angelus Bassus,
as he originally called himself — Angelo Ambrogini, as some called him —
took his more famous name from Monte Poliziano, in the Florentine
hinterland. Coming to Florence he studied Latin under Cristoforo
Landino, Greek under Andronicus of Salonica, Platonism under Ficino, and
the Aristotelian philosophy under Argyropoulos. At sixteen he began to
translate Homer into a Latin so idiomatic and vigorous that it seemed
the product of at least the Silver Age of Roman poetry. Having finished
the first two books, he sent them to Lorenzo. That prince of patrons,
alert to every excellence, encouraged him to continue, took him into his
home as tutor of his son Piero, and provided for all his needs. So freed
from want, Politian edited ancient texts — among them the Pandects of
Justinian — with a learning and judgment that won universal praise. When
Landino published an edition of Horace, Politian prefaced it with an ode
comparable in Latinity, phrasing, and complex versification with the
poems of Horace himself. His lectures on classic literature were
attended by the Medici, Pico della Mirandola, and foreign students —
Reuchlin, Grocyn, Linacre, and others — who had heard, beyond the Alps,
the echo of his fame as scholar, poet, and orator in three tongues. It
was not unusual for him to prelude a lecture with an extensive Latin
poem composed for the occasion; one such piece, in sono- rous
hexameters, was nothing less than a history of poetry from Homer to
Boccaccio. This and other poems, published by Politian under the title
of Sylvae, revealed a Latin style so facile and fluent, so vivid in
imagery, that the humanists acclaimed him as their master despite his
youth, and rejoiced that the noble language which they aspired to
restore had been taught to live again.</p>
<p>While making himself almost a Latin classic, Politian issued with
fertile ease a succession of Italian poems that stand unrivaled between
Petrarch</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>I2 4</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>and Ariosto. When Lorenzo’s brother Giuliano won a joust in 1475,</p>
<p>Politian described La giostra in ottava rima of melodious elegance;
and in La bella Simonetta he celebrated the aristocratic beauty of
Giuliano’s be - loved with such eloquence and finesse that Italian love
poetry took on thereafter a new delicacy of diction and feeling.
Giuliano tells how, going out to hunt, he came upon Simonetta and other
lasses dancing in a field.</p>
<p>The beauteous nymph who feeds my soul with fire</p>
<p>I found in gentle, pure, and prudent mood,</p>
<p>In graceful attitude,</p>
<p>Loving and courteous, holy, wise, benign.</p>
<p>So sweet, so tender was her face divine,</p>
<p>So gladsome, that in those celestial eyes</p>
<p>Shone perfect paradise,</p>
<p>Yea, all the good that we poor mortals crave….</p>
<p>Down from her royal head and lustrous brow</p>
<p>The golden curls fell joyously unpent,</p>
<p>While through the choir she went</p>
<p>With feet well lessoned to the rhythmic sound.</p>
<p>Her eyes, though scarcely raised above the ground,</p>
<p>Sent me by stealth a ray divinely fair;</p>
<p>But still her jealous hair</p>
<p>Broke the bright beam, and veiled her from my gaze.</p>
<p>She, born and nursed in heaven for angels’ prais e,</p>
<p>No sooner saw this wrong than back she drew —</p>
<p>With hand of purest hue —</p>
<p>Her truant curls with kind and gentle mien;</p>
<p>Then from her eyes a soul so fiery keen,</p>
<p>So sweet a soul of love, she cast on mine</p>
<p>That scarce can I divine</p>
<p>How then I ’scaped from burning utterly. 19</p>
<p>For his own mistress, Ippolita Leoncina, Politian composed love songs
of exquisite grace and tenderness; and, overflowing with rhymes, he
fashioned similar lyrics to be used by his friends as charms to exorcise
modesty. He learned the ballads of the peasantry, and reshaped them into
finished literary form; so rephrased they passed back into popularity,
and have left echoes in Tuscany to this day. In La brunettina mia he
described a village beauty bathing her face and bosom at a fountain, and
crowning her hair with flowers; “her breasts were as May roses, her lips
were as strawberries”; it is a hackneyed theme that never palls. Trying
to recapture that union of</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>drama, poetry, music, and song which had been accomplished in the
Dionysian Theater of the Greeks, Politian composed — in two days, he
vows — a little lyric drama of 434 lines, which was sung for
Cardinal</p>
<p>Francesco Gonzaga at Mantua (1472). It was called La favola di Orfeo
— The Fable of Orpheus — and told how Orpheus’ wife Eurydice died of a
snake bite as she fled from an amorous shepherd; how the disconsolate
Orpheus made his way down to Hades, and so charmed Pluto with his lyre
that the lord of the underworld restored Eurydice to him on condition
that he should not look upon her until quite emerged from Hades. He had
led her but a few steps when, in the ecstasy of his love, he turned to
look upon her; whereupon she was snatched back to Hades, and he was
barred from following her. In an insane reaction Orpheus became a
misogynist, and recommended that men should ignore women and satisfy
themselves with boys after the example of sated Zeus with Ganymede.
Woodland maenads, furious at his contempt of women, beat him to death,
flayed him, tore him limb from limb, and rejoiced tunefully in their
revenge. The music that accompanied the lines is lost; but we may safely
rank the Orfeo among the harbingers of Italian opera.</p>
<p>Politian fell short of greatness as a poet because he avoided the
pitfalls of passion and never plumbed the depths of life or love; he is
always charm- ing and never profound. His love for Lorenzo was the
strongest feeling that he knew. He was at his patron’s side when
Giuliano was killed in the cathedral; he saved Lorenzo by slamming and
bolting the doors of the sacristy in the face of the conspirators. When
Lorenzo returned from his perilous journey to Naples Politian welcomed
him with verses almost scandalously affectionate. When Lorenzo passed
away Politian mourned him inconsolably, and then gradually faded out. He
died two years later, like Pico, in the fateful year 1494, when the
French discovered Italy.</p>
<p>Lorenzo would not have been the full man that he was had he not en-
joyed some humor with his philosophy, some doubt with his faith, some
license with his loves. As his son would welcome jesters and smile at
risque comedies at the papal court, so the banker prince of Florence in-
vited to his friendship and his table Luigi Pulci, and relished the
rough satire of the Morgante maggiore. That famous poem, so admired by
Byron, was read aloud, canto by canto, to Lorenzo and his household
guests. Luigi was a man of robust and uninhibited wit, who convulsed a
palace and a nation by applying the language, idioms, and views of the
bourgeoisie to the romances of chivalry. The legends of Charlemagne’s
adventures in France, Spain, and Palestine had entered Italy in the
twelfth century or be-</p>
<p>126 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>fore, and had been spread through the peninsula by minstrels and im-
provisatori to the delight of every class. But there has always been, in
the common male of the species, a bluff and lusty self-ridiculing
realism, ac- companying and checking the romantic spirit given to
literature and art by woman and youth. Pulci combined all these
qualities, and put together — from popular legends, from the manuscripts
in the Laurentian Library, and from the conversation at Lorenzo’s table—
an epic that laughs at the giants, demons, and battles of chivalric
tales, and recounts, in sometimes serious, sometimes mocking verse, the
adventures of the Christian knight Orlando and the Saracen giant who
gives the poem half its name.*</p>
<p>Attacked by Orlando, Morgante saves himself by announcing his sudden
conversion to Christianity. Orlando teaches him theology; explains to
him that his two brothers, just slain, are now in hell as infidels;
promises him heaven if he becomes a good Christian; but warns him that
in heaven he will be re quired to look without pity upon his burning
relatives. “The doctors of our Church,” says the Christian knight, “are
agreed that if those who are glorified in heaven were to feel pity for
their miserable kindred, who lie in such horrible confusion in hell,
their beatitude would come to nothing.” Morgante is not disturbed. “You
shall see,” he assures Orlando, “if I grieve for my brethren, and
whether or no I submit to the will of God and behave myself like an
angel… I will cut off the hands of my brothers, and take the hands to
these holy monks, that they may be sure that their enemies are
dead.”</p>
<p>In the eighteenth canto Pulci introduces another giant, Margute, a
jolly thief and mild murderer, who ascribes to himself every vice but
that of be- t raying a friend. To Morgante’s question whether he
believes in Christ or prefers Mohammed, Margute answers:</p>
<p>I don’t believe in black more than in blue,</p>
<p>But in fat capons, boiled or maybe roasted;</p>
<p>And I believe sometimes in butter, too,</p>
<p>In beer and must, where bobs a pippin toasted;…</p>
<p>But mostly to old wine my faith I pin,</p>
<p>And hold him saved who firmly trusts therein….</p>
<p>Faith, like the itch, is catching;…</p>
<p>Faith is as man gets it — this, that, or another.</p>
<p>See then what sort of c reed I’m bound to follow:</p>
<p>For you must know a Greek nun was my mother,</p>
<p>My sire, at Brusa mid the Turks, a mullah. 21</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulci published first the cantos referring to Morgante; the
completed poem was called Morgante maggiore — The Greater Morgante.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>Margute dies of laughter after rollicking through two cantos;
Pulci</p>
<p>wastes no tear over him, but pulls from his magic fancy a demon of
the first order, Astarotte, who rebelled with Lucifer. Summoned from
hell by the sorcerer Malagigi to bring Rinaldo swiftly from Egypt to
Roncesvalles, he accomplishes the matter deftly, and wins such affection
from Rinaldo that the Christian knight proposes to beg God to free
Astarotte from hell. But the courteous devil is an excellent theologian,
and points out that re- bellion against infinite Justice was an infinite
crime, requiring eternal punishment. Malagigi wonders why a God who
foresaw everything, in- cluding Lucifer’s disobedience and everlasting
damnation, proceeded t o create him; Astarotte confesses that this is a
mystery which even a wise devil cannot resolve. 22</p>
<p>He was in truth a wise devil, for Pulci, writing in 1483, puts into
his</p>
<p>mouth an astonishing anticipation of Columbus. Referring to the old
warn- ing, at the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar), ne plus ultra — “go
no further”— Astarotte says to Rinaldo:</p>
<p>Know that this theory is false; his bark</p>
<p>The daring mariner shall urge far o’er</p>
<p>The western wave, a smooth and level plain</p>
<p>Albeit the earth is fashioned like a wheel.</p>
<p>Man was in ancient days of grosser mold,</p>
<p>And Hercules might blush to learn how far</p>
<p>Beyond the limits he had vainly set</p>
<p>The dullest sea-boat soon shall wing her way,</p>
<p>Men shall descry another hemisphere.</p>
<p>Since to one common center all things tend,</p>
<p>So earth, by curious mystery divine</p>
<p>Well balanced, hangs amid the starry spheres.</p>
<p>At our antipodes are cities, states,</p>
<p>And thronged empires, ne’er divined of yore.</p>
<p>But see, the Sun speeds on his western path</p>
<p>To glad the nations with expected light. 23</p>
<p>It was part of Pulci’s method to introduce each canto, however full
of buffoonery, with a pious invocation of God and the saints; the more
pro- fane the matter, the more solemn the prologue. The poem ends with a
declaration of faith in the goodness of all religions — a proposition
sure to offend every true believer. Now and then Pulci allows himself a
timid heresy, as when he quotes Scripture to argue that Christ’s
foreknowledge did not equal that of God the Father, or when he allows
himself to hope</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>hat all souls, even Lucifer, will in the end be saved. But like a
good</p>
<p>Florentine, and the other members of Lorenzo’s circle, he remained ex
- ternally faithful to a Church inextricably bound up with Italian life.
Ec- clesiastics were not deceived by his obeisance; when he died (1484)
his body was refused burial in consecrated ground.</p>
<p>If Lorenzo’s group could produce so varied a literature in one
generation, we may reasonably suppose — and shall find — a like
awakening in other cities —Milan, Ferrara, Naples, Rome. In the century
between Cosimo’s birth and Lorenzo’s death Italy had accomplished and
transcended the first stage in her Renaissance. She had rediscovered
ancient Greece and Rome, had established the essentials of classical
scholarship, and had made Latin again a language of masculine splendor
and pithy force. But more: in the genera- tion between Cosimo’s death
and Lorenzo’s, Italy rediscovered her own language and soul, applied the
new standards of diction and form to the vernacular, and composed poetry
classical in spirit, but indigenous and “modern” in tongue and thought,
rooted in the affairs and problems of its own day, or in the scenes and
persons of the countryside. And again: Italy in one generation, through
Pulci, had lifted the humorous romance into literature, had prepared the
way for Boiardo and Ariosto, had even anticipated Cervantes’ smiles at
chivalric fustian and pretense. The age of the scholars receded,
imitation gave way to creation; Italian literature, which had languished
after Petrarch’s choice of Latin for his epic, was re - born. Soon the
revival of antiquity would be almost forgotten in the exuberance of an
Italian culture leading the world in letters, and flooding it with
art.</p>
<p>V. ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE: THE AGE OF VERROCCHIO</p>
<p>Lorenzo continued enthusiastically the Medicean tradition of
supporting art. “He was such an admirer of all the remains of
antiquity,” wrote his contem - porary V alori, “that there was nothing
with which he was more delighted. Those who wished to oblige him were
accustomed to collect, from every part of the world, medals, coins…
statues, busts, and whatever else bore the stamp” of ancient Greece or
Rome. 24 Uniting his architectural and sculptural collec- tions with
those left by Cosimo and Piero, he placed them in a garden between the
Medici palace and the monastery of San Marco, and admitted to them all
responsible scholars and visitors. To students who showed application
and promise — among whom was the young Michelangelo — he gave a stipend
for their maintenance, and awards for special proficiency. Says Vasari:
“It is highly deserving of notice that all those who studied in the
gardens of the</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>Medici, and were favored by Lorenzo, became excellent artists. This
can only be ascribed to the exquisite judgment of this great patron… who
could not merely distinguish men of genius, but had the will and power
to reward them.” 25</p>
<p>The key event in the art history of Lorenzo’s regime was the
publication (i486) of Vitruvius’ treatise De architectura (first century
b.c.), which Poggio had unearthed in the monastery of St. Gall some
seventy years before. Lorenzo succumbed completely to that rigid
classic, and used his influence to spread the style of Imperial Rome.
Perhaps in this matter he did as much harm as good, for he discouraged
in architecture what he was fruitfully practising in litera- ture — the
development of native forms. But his spirit was generous. Through his
encouragement, and in many cases with his funds, Florence was now
adorned with elegant civic buildings and private residences. He
completed the church of San Lorenzo and the abbey at Fiesole, and he
engaged Giuliano da Sangallo to design a monastery outside the San Gallo
gate that gave the architect his name. Giuliano built for him a stately
villa at Poggio a Caiano, and so handsomely that Lorenzo recommended him
when King Ferdinand of Naples asked him for an architect. How well such
artists loved him appears in the subsequent generosity of Giuliano, who
sent as presents to Lorenzo the gifts that Ferrante gave him — a bust of
the Emperor Hadrian, a Sleeping Cupid , and other ancient sculptures.
Lorenzo added these to the collections in his garden, which were later
to form the nucleus of the statuary in the Ufflzi Gallery.</p>
<p>Other rich men rivaled — some surpassed — him in the splendor of
their resi- dences. About 1489 Benedetto da Maiano built for Filippo
Strozzi the Elder the most perfect embodiment of that “Tuscan” style of
architecture which Brunellesco had developed in the Pitti Palace —
internal splendor and luxury behind a massive front of “rustic” or
unfinished stone blocks. It w as begun with careful astrological timing,
with religious services in several churches, and with a conciliatory
distribution of alms. After Benedetto’s death (1497) Simone Pollaiuolo*
completed the building, and added a fine cornice on the model of one
that he had seen in Rome. How excellent the interior of these seeming
prisons might be we may surmise from their magnificent fireplaces —
mighty marble entablatures supported by floral-carved pillars and
surmounted with re- liefs. Meanwhile the Signory continued to improve
its unique and beautiful home, the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
<p>Most of the architects were sculptors too, for sculpture played the
leading part in architectural ornament, carving cornices and moldings,
pilasters and capitals, door jambs and chimney pieces, wall reliefs,
altars, choir stalls, pulpits, and baptismal fonts. Giuliano da Maiano
carved the stalls in the sacristy of the cathedral and in the abbey at
Fiesole. His brother Benedetto developed the</p>
<p>Called II Cronaca from the lively record he wrote of his travels and
studies.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>art of intarsia, and became so famous for it that King Matthias
Corvinus of Hungary ordered from him two coffers of inlaid wood, and
invited him to his court. Benedetto went, and had the coffers sent after
him; when these arrived at Budapest and were unpacked in the presence of
the King the inlaid pieces fell out, the glue having been loosened by
the damp sea air; and Bene- detto, though he replaced the pieces
successfully, took a distaste to marquetry, and devoted himself
thereafter to sculpture. There are few sculptured Virgins lovelier than
his Enthroned Madonna , few busts that surpass his honest and revealing
Filippo Strozzi , few tombs so fine as that of the same Strozzi in Santa
Maria Novella, no pulpit more elegantly carved than that which Benedetto
made for the church of Santa Croce, and few altars so near perfection as
that of Santa Fina in the Collegiate Church of San Gimignano.</p>
<p>Sculpture and architecture tended to run in families — the della
Robbias, the Sangalli, the Rossellini, the Pollaiuoli. Antonio
Pollaiuolo, uncle of Simone, learned accuracy and delicacy of design as
a goldsmith in the studio of his father Iacopo. The bronze, silver and
gold products of Antonio made him the Cellini of his time, and a
favorite of Lorenzo, the churches, the Signory, and the guilds. Noting
how rarely such small objects retained the name of their maker, and
sharing the Renaissance mirage of immortal fame, Antonio turned to
sculpture, and cast in bronze two magnificent figures of Hercules,
rivaling the strained power of Michelangelo’s Captives , and the
tortured pas - sion of the Laocoon. Passing to painting, he told the
story of Hercules in three murals for the Medici palace, challenged
Botticelli in Apollo and Daphne , and equaled the absurdity of a hundred
artists in showing how calmly St. Sebastian could receive into his
flawless body the arrows launched at him by leisurely bowmen. In his
final years Antonio returned to sculpture and cast for the old church of
St. Peter in Rome two superb sepulchral monuments — of Sixtus IV and
Innocent VIII — with a vigor of chiseling and a precision of anatomy
again presaging Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Mino da Fiesole was not so versatile nor so tempestuous; he was
content to learn the sculptor’s art from Desiderio da Settignano, and
when his master died, to carry on his tradition of smooth elegance. If
we may believe Vasari, Mino was so affected by Desiderio’s early death t
hat he found no happiness in Florence, and sought new scenes in Rome.
There he made a name for himself with three masterpieces: tombs of
Francesco Tornabuoni and Pope Paul II, and a marble tabernacle for
Cardinal d’Estouteville. His confidence and sol - vency restored, he
returned to Florence, and adorned with exquisite altars the churches of
Sant’ Ambrogio and Santa Croce, and the Baptistery. In the cathedral of
his native Fiesole he set up in classical style an ornate tomb for
Bishop Salutati, and for the abbey of Fiesole he molded a similar
monument, more restrained in ornament, to commemorate the Count Ugo who
had founded that monastery. The cathedral of Prato boasts a pulpit by
him, and a dozen</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>museums display one or more of the busts by which his patrons were
less flattered than embalmed: the face of Niccolo Strozzi, swollen as
with the mumps, the weak features of Piero the Gouty, the fine head of
Dietisalvi Neroni, a pretty relief of Marcus Aurelius as a youth, a
splendid bust of St. John the Baptist in infancy, and several lovely
reliefs of the Virgin and Child. Nearly all these works have the
feminine grace that Mino had learned from Desiderio; they are pleasing,
but not arresting or profound; they do not grip our interest as do the
sculptures of Antonio Pollaiuolo or Antonio Rossellino. Mino loved
Desiderio too much; he could not turn his back upon his master’s
exemplars and seek in the merciless neutrality of Nature the significant
realities of life.</p>
<p>Verrocchio — “True Eye”— was brave enough to do this, and produced
two of the greatest sculptures of his time. Andrea di Michele Cione (for
that was his real name) was a goldsmith, a sculptor, a bell-caster, a
painter, a geometrician, a musician. As a painter his chief claim to
fame lies in hav- ing taught and influenced Leonardo, Lorenzo di Credi,
and Perugino; his own paintings are mostly stiff and dead. There are few
Renaissance pic- tures more unpleasant than the famous Baptism of
Christ; the Baptist is a dour Puritan, Christ, presumably thirty, looks
like an old man, and the two angels at the left are effeminately
insipid, including the one traditionally ascribed to Leonardo. But
Tobias and the Three Angels is excellent; the central angel foreshadows
the grace and mood of Botticelli, and the young Tobias is so fair that
we must either attribute him to Leonardo, or confess that da Vinci
received more of his pictorial style from Verrocchio than we supposed. A
drawing of a woman’s hea d, in Christ Church, Oxford, again suggests the
vague und pensive ethereality of Leonardo’s women; and Verrocchio’s dark
landscapes already feature the gloomy rocks and mystic streams of
Leonardo’s dreamy masterpieces.</p>
<p>Probably there is mostly fable i n Vasari’s tale that when
Verrocchio</p>
<p>saw the angel that Leonardo had painted in The Baptism of Christ he
“re - solved never to touch the brush again, because Leonardo, though so
young, had so far surpassed him.” 26 But though Verrocchio continued to
pai nt after the Baptism, it is true that he gave most of his mature
years to sculp- ture. He worked for a while with Donatello and Antonio
Pollaiuolo,</p>
<p>learned something from each of them, and then developed his own style
of stem and angular realism. He took his career in his hands by molding
in terra cotta an unflattering bust of Lorenzo — nose and bangs and
worried brow. In any case II Magnifico was well pleased with two bronze
reliefs — of Alexander and Darius — made for him by Verrocchio; he sent
them to</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, and engaged the sculptor (1472) to de-
sign, in the church of San Lorenzo, a tomb for his father Piero and his
uncle Giovanni. Verrocchio carved the sarcophagus in porphyry, and
decorated it with bronze supports and wreaths in exquisite floral form.
Four years later he cast a boyish David standing in calm pride over the
severed head of Goliath; the Signory liked it so much that it placed the
statue at the head of the main stairway in the Palazzo Vecchio. In the
same year it ac- cepted from him a bronze Boy Holding a Dolphin, and
used it as a foun- tain spout in the courtyard of the palace. At the
height of his powers Verrocchio designed, and cast in bronze for a niche
on the exterior of Or San Michele, a group of Christ and Doubting Thomas
(1483). The Christ is a figure of divine nobility, Thomas is portrayed
with understanding sympathy, the hands are finished with a perfection
seldom attained in statuary, the robes are a triumph of sculptural art;
the whole group has a living and mobile reality.</p>
<p>So obvious was Verrocchio’s superiority in bronze that the
Venetian</p>
<p>The Venetian sculptor Alessandro Leopardi completed the great statue
in so vivid a style, with such mastery of motion and command, that the
Colleoni suffered no loss by Verrocchio’s death. It was set up (1496) in
the Campo di San Zanipolo — the Field of Sts. John and Paul; and it

</ol>
<p>Verrocchio’s thriving studio was characteristic of Renaissance
Florence — it united all the arts in one workshop, sometimes in one man;
in the same bottega one artist might be designing a church or a palace,
another might be carving or casting a statue, another sketching or
painting a picture, an- other cutting or setting gems, another carving
or inlaying ivory or wood, or fusing or beating metal, or fashioning
floats and pennons for a festival procession; men like Verrocchio,
Leonardo, or Michelangelo could do any of these. Florence had many such
studios, and art students went wild in the streets, 27 or lived
Bohemianly in the tenements, or became rich men honored by popes and
princes as inspired spirits beyond price and — like Cellini — above the
law. More than any other city except Athens, Florence attached
importance to art and artists, talked and fought about them, and told
anecdotes about them, 28 as we do now of actors and actresses. It was
Renaissance Florence that formed the romantic concept of the genius —
the man inspired by a divine spirit (the Latin genius) dwelling within
him.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that Verrocchio’s studio left no great sculp tor
(ex- cept one side of Leonardo) to carry on the master’s excellence, but
taught two painters of high degree — Leonardo and Perugino — and one of
lesser but notable talent, Lorenzo di Credi. Painting was gradually
ousting sculpture as the favorite art. Probably it was an advantage that
the painters were uninstructed and uninhibited by the lost murals of
antiquity. They knew that there had been such men as Apelles and
Protogenes, but few of them saw even the Alexandrian or Pompeian
remnants of ancient painting. In this art there was no revival of
antiquity, and the continuity of the Middle Ages with the Renaissance
was most visible: the line was devious but clear from the Byzantines to
Duccio to Giotto to Fra Angelico to Leonardo to Raphael to Titian. So
the painters, unlike the sculptors, had to forge through trial and error
their own technology and style; originality and experiment were forced
upon them. They labored over the details of hu- man, animal, and plant
anatomy; they tried circular, triangular, or other schemes of
composition; they explored the tricks of perspective and the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>illusions of chiaroscuro to give depth to their backgrounds and body
to their figures; they scoured the streets for Apostles and Virgins, and
drew from models clothed or nude; they passed from fresco to tempera and
back again, and appropriated the new techniques of oil painting
introduced into northern Italy by Rogier van der Weyden and Antonio da
Messina. As their skill and courage grew, and their lay patrons
multiplied, they added to the old religious subjects the stories of
classic mythology and the pagan glories of the flesh. They took Nature
into the studio, or betook themselves to Nature; nothing human or
natural seemed in their view alien to art, no face so ugly but art could
reveal its illuminating significance. They recorded the world; and when
war and politics had made Italy a prison and a ruin, the painters left
behind them the line and color, the life and passion, of the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>Formed by such studies, inheriting an ever richer tradition of
methods, materials, and ideas, men of talent painted better now than men
of genius had painted a century before. Benozzo Gozzoli, says Vasari in
an un- gr acious moment, “was not of great excellence… yet he distanced
all the others of his age in his perseverance; for among the multitude
of his works some could hardly help but be good.” 20 He began as a pupil
of Fra Angelico, and followed him to Rome and Orvieto as assistant.
Piero the Gouty recalled him to Florence and invited him to portray, on
the walls of the chapel in the Medici Palace, the journey of the Magi
from the East to Bethlehem. These frescoes are Benozzo’s chef -
d’oeuvre: a stately an d yet lively procession of kings and knights in
gorgeous robes, of squires, pages, angels, hunters, scholars, slaves,
horses, leopards, dogs, and half a dozen Medici — and Benozzo himself
slyly introduced into the parade — and all against backgrounds and
landscapes marvelous and picturesque. Flushed with triumph, Benozzo went
to San Gimignano, and decorated the choir of Sant’ Agostino with
seventeen scenes from the life of its patron saint. In the Campo Santo
at Pisa he labored for sixteen years, covering vast walls with
twenty-one Old Testament scenes from Adam to the Queen of Sheba; some,
like The Tower of Babel, were among the major frescoes of the
Renaissance. Benozzo diluted his excellence through eager haste; he drew
carelessly, made many of his figures depressingly uniform, and crowded
his pictures with a confusing multitude of persons and details; but he
had in him the blood and joy of life, he loved its lusty panorama and
the glory of the great; and the imperfections of his line are half for-
gotten in the splendor of his color and the enthusiasm of his
fertility.</p>
<p>The benign influence of Fra Angelico passed down to Alesso
Baldovinetti</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>and Cosimo Roselli, and through Alesso to one of the major painters
of the Renaissance — Domenico Ghirlandaio. Domenico’s father was a
goldsmith who had received the nickname of Ghirlandaio from the gold and
silver garlands that he had fashioned for the pretty heads of Florence.
Under this father and Baldovinetti Domenico studied with zest and zeal;
spent many hours before the frescoes of Masaccio in the Carmine; learned
by in- defatigable practice the arts of perspective, foreshortening,
modeling, and composition; “he would draw everyone who passed the shop,”
says Vasari, “making extraordinary likenesses” after a fleeting view. He
was barely twenty-one when he was charged to paint the story of Santa
Fina in her chapel in the cathedral at San Gimignano. At thirty-one
(1480) he earned the title of master by four frescoes in the church and
refectory of the Ognissanti in Florence — a St. Jerome, a Descent From
the Cross, a Madonna della Misericordia (which included a portrait of
the donor, Amerigo</p>
<p>Vespucci), and a Last Supper that gave some hints to Leonardo.</p>
<p>Summoned to Rome by Sixtus IV, he painted in the Sistine Chapel
Christ Calling Peter and Andrew from Their Nets — especially beautiful
in its background of mountains, sea, and sky. During this stay in Rome
he studied and drew the arches, baths, columns, aqueducts, and
amphitheaters of the ancient city, and with so practiced an eye that he
was able to seize at once, without rule or compass, the just proportions
of each part. A Florentine merchant in Rome, Francesco Tornabuoni,
mourning his dead wife, employed Ghirlandaio to paint frescoes for her
memorial in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and Domenico succeeded so well
that Tornabuoni sent him back to Florence armed with florins and a
letter attesting his ex- cellence. The Signory soon entrusted to him the
decoration of the Sala del Orologio in their palace. In the next four
years (1481-5) he painted scenes from the life of St. Francis in the
Sassetti Chapel of Santa Trinita. All the progress of the painter’s art,
except the use of oil, was embodied in these frescoes: harmonious
composition, accurate line, gradations of light, per- spective fidelity,
realistic portraiture (of Lorenzo, Politian, Pulci, Palla Strozzi,
Francesco Sassetti), and at the same time the Angelesque tradition of
ideality and piety. From the near-perfection of the altarpiece — the
Adoration of the Shepherds — there would be but a step of deeper
imagina- tion and subtler grace to Leonardo and Raphael.</p>
<p>In 1485 Giovanni Tornabuoni, chief of the Medici bank in Rome,
of-</p>
<p>fered Ghirlandaio twelve hundred ducats (0,000) to paint a chapel in
Santa Maria Novella, and promised him two hundred more if the work
should prove fully satisfactory. Aided by several pupils, including
Michel-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>angelo, Ghirlandaio gave most of the following five years to this
high mo- ment of his career. On the ceiling he painted the four
Evangelists; on the walls St. Francis, Peter Martyr, John the Baptist,
and scenes from the lives of Mary and Christ, from an Annunciation to a
magnificent Coronation of the Virgin. Here again he delighted in
contemporary portraits: the stately Lodovica Tornabuoni, fit to be a
queen, the saucy beauty of Ginevra de’ Benci, the scholars Ficino,
Politian, and Landino, the painters Baldovinetti, Mainardi, and
Ghirlandaio himself. When, in 1490, the chapel was opened to the public,
all the dignitaries and literati of Florence flocked to examine the
paintings; the realistic portraits were the talk of the town; and Torna-
buoni expressed himself as completely satisfied. Financially pressed at
the time, he begged Domenico to forgive him the extra two hundred
ducats; the artist replied that the satisfaction of his patron was more
precious to him than any gold.</p>
<p>He was a lovable character, so adored by his brothers that one of
them, David, almost slew an abbot with an aged loaf of bread for
bringing to Domenico and his aides food that David held unworthy of his
brother’s genius. Ghirlandaio opened his studio to all who cared to work
or study there, making it a veritable school of art. He accepted all
commissions, great or small, saying that none should be denied; he left
the care of his household and finances to David, saying that he would
not be content till he had painted the whole circuit of Florence’s wall.
He produced many mediocre paintings, and yet some incidental pieces of
great charm, like the Louvre’s delightful Grandfather with the bulbous
nose, and the lovely Portrait of a Woman in the Morgan Collection in New
York — pictures full of the character that year by year records itself
upon the human face. Great critics of unquestionable learning and repute
yield him only a minor rank; 30 and it is true that he excelled rather
in line than in color, that he painted too rapidly, and crowded his
pictures with irrelevant detail, and took a step backward, perhaps, in
preferring tempera after Baldovinetti’s experiments with oil. Even so,
he brought the accumulated technology of his art to the highest point
that it would reach in his country and his cen- tury; and he bequeathed
to Florence and the world such treasures that criticism hangs its head
in gratitude.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Botticelli</li>
</ol>
<p>Only one Florentine surpassed him in his generation. Sandro
Botticelli was as different from Ghirlandaio as ethereal fancy from
physical fact. Alessandro’s father, Mariano Filipepi, unable to persuade
the boy that life</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>would be impossible without reading, writing, and arithmetic,
apprenticed him to the goldsmith Botticelli, whose name, through the
affection of the pupil or the whim of history, became permanently
attached to Sandro’s own. From this bottega the lad passed at sixteen to
that of Fra Filippo Lippi, who came to love the restless and impet uous
youth. Filippo’s Filippino later painted Sandro as a sullen fellow with
deep-set eyes, salient nose, sensual fleshy mouth, flowing locks, purple
cap, red mantle, and green hose; 81 who would have guessed such a man
from the delicate fantasies that Botticelli has left to the museums?
Perhaps every artist must be a sensualist before he can paint ideally;
he must know and love the body as the ultimate source and standard of
the esthetic sense. Vasari describes Sandro as “a merry fellow,” who
played pranks upon fellow artists and obtuse citizens. Doubt- less, like
all of us, he was many men, turned on one or another of his selves as
occasion required, and kept his real self a frightened secret from the
world.</p>
<p>About 1465 Botticelli set up his own studio, and soon received
commis- sions from the Medici. It was apparently for Lorenzo’s mother,
Lucrezia Tornabuoni, that he painted Judith ; and for Piero Gottoso, her
husband, he made his Madonna of the Magnificat and his Adoration of the
Magi — hymns in color to three Medici generations. In the Madonna
Botticelli pictured Lorenzo and Giuliano as boys of sixteen and twelve,
holding a book upon which the Virgin — borrowed from Fra Lippo — writes
her noble song of praise; in the Adoration Cosimo kneel s at Mary’s
feet, Piero kneels at a lower level before them, and Lorenzo, now
seventeen, holds a sword in his hand as a sign that he has reached the
age of legitimate killing.</p>
<p>Lorenzo and Giuliano carried on Piero’s patronage of Botticelli.
His</p>
<p>finest portraits are of Giuliano and Giuliano’s beloved Simonetta
Vespucci. He still painted religious pictures, like the powerful
St. Augustine in the church of the Ognissanti; but in this period,
perhaps under the influence of Lorenzo’s circle, he turned mo re and
more to pagan subjects, usually from classical mythology, and favoring
the nude. Vasari reports that “in many houses Botticelli painted… plenty
of naked women,” and accuses him of “serious disorders in his living”;
82 the humanists, and anim al spirits, had won Sandro for a time to an
epicurean philosophy. It was apparently for Lo- renzo and Giuliano that
he painted (1480) The Birth of Venus. A demure nude rises from a golden
shell in the sea, using her long blonde tresses as the only fig leaf at
hand; on her right winged zephyrs blow her to the shore; on her left a
pretty maid (Simonetta?), clad in a gown of flowered white, offers the
goddess a mantle to enhance her loveliness. The painting is a
masterpiece of grace, in which design and composition are
everything,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>color is subordinate, realism is ignored, and everything is directed
to evok- ing an ethereal fancy through the flowing rhythm of the line.
Botticelli had taken the theme from a pass age in Politian’s La giostra.
From a de - scription, in the same poem, of Giuliano’s victories in
jousts and love the artist took his second pagan picture, Mars and
Venus; here Venus is clothed, and may again be Simonetta; Mars lies
exhausted and asleep, no rude warrior but a youth of unblemished flesh,
who might almost be mis- taken for another Aphrodite. Finally, in his
Spring ( Primavera ) Botticelli expressed the mood of Lorenzo’s hymn to
Bacchus (“Who would be</p>
<p>happy, let him be!”): the auxiliary lady of the Birth reappears with
her flowing robe and pretty feet; at the left Giuliano (?) plucks an
apple</p>
<p>from a tree to give to one of the three graces standing half nude
beside him; on the right a lusty male seizes a maiden dressed in a
little mist; Simonetta presides modestly over the scene; and in the air
above her Cupid shoots his quite superfluous darts. These three pictures
symbolized many things, for Botticelli loved to allegorize; but perhaps
without his realizing it they represented also the victory of the
humanists in art. The Church would now for half a century (1480-1534)
struggle to regain her domi- nance over pictorial themes.</p>
<p>As if to meet the issue squarely, Sixtus IV called Botticelli to
Rome</p>
<p>(1481), and commissioned him to paint three frescoes in the Sistine
Chapel. They are not among his masterpieces; he was in no mood for
piety. But when he returned to Florence (1485) he found the city astir
with Savona- rola’s sermons, and went to hear him. He was deeply moved.
He had al - ways harbored a strain of austerity, and whatever skepticism
he might have caught from Lorenzo, Pulci, and Politian had been lost in
the secret well of his youthful faith. Now the fiery preacher at San
Marco’s pressed upon him and Florence the awful implications of that
faith: God had allowed Himself to be insulted, scourged, and crucified
to redeem mankind from the guilt of Adam and Eve’s sin; only a life of
virtue or sincere repentance</p>
<p>Barnabas he painted a masterly group of the Virgin enthroned, with
divers saints; she was still the tender and lovely maiden whom he had
drawn in Fra Lippo’s studio. Soon afterward he painted the Madonna of
the</p>
<p>Pomegranate — the Virgin surrounded by singing cherubim, the Child
hold- ing in His hand the fruit whose innumerable seeds symbolized the
dissemi-</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>nation of the Christian faith. In 1490 he recapitulated the epic of
the Divine Mother in two pictures: the Annunciation and the Coronation.
But he was aging now, and had lost the fresh clarity and grace of his
art.</p>
<p>In 1498 Savonarola was hanged and burned. Botticelli was horrified at
this most distinguished murder of the Renaissance. Perhaps it was
shortly after that tragedy that he painted his complex symbolism,
Calumny. Against a background of classic archways and distant sea three
women — Fraud, Deception, Calumny — led by a ragged male (Envy), drag a
nude victim by the hair to a tribunal where a judge with the long ears
of an ass, advised by females personifying Suspicion and Ignorance,
prepares to yield to the fury and bloodthirst of the crowd and condemn
the fallen man; while at the left Remorse, garbed in black, looks in
sorrow upon naked Truth — Botticelli’s Venus once more, clad in the same
reptilian hair. Was the victim intended to represent Savonarola?
Perhaps, though the nudes might have startled the monk.</p>
<p>The Nativity in the National Gallery at London is Botticelli’s
final</p>
<p>masterpiece, confused but colorful, and capturing for the last time
his rhythmic grace. Here all seems to breathe a heavenly happiness; the
ladies of the Spring return as winged angels, hailing the miraculous and
saving birth, and dancing precariously on a bough suspended in space.
But on the picture Botticelli wrote in Greek these words, savoring of
Savonarola, and recalling the Middle Ages in the height of the
Renaissance:</p>
<p>This picture I, Alessandro, painted at the end of the year 1500,
in</p>
<p>he troubles of Italy… during the fulfillment of the Eleventh</p>
<p>[Chapter] of St. John, in the second woe of the Apocalypse, in
the</p>
<p>loosing of the Devil for three years and a half. Later he shall
be</p>
<p>chained, according to the Twelfth of St. John, and we shall see
him</p>
<p>rodden down as in this picture.</p>
<p>After 1500 we have no paintings from his hand. He was only fifty-six,
and might have had some art left in him; but he yielded place to
Leonardo and Michelangelo, and lapsed into a morose poverty. The Medici
who had been his mainstay gave him charity, but they themselves were in
a fallen state. He died alone and infirm, aged sixty-six, while the
forgetful world hurried on.</p>
<p>Among his pupils was his teacher’s son, Filippino Lippi. This
“love</p>
<p>child”* was loved by all who knew him: a man gentle, affable, modest,
courteous, whose “excellence was such,” says Vasari, “that he
obliterated</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowe and Cavalcaselle have labored to restore Filippino’s
legitimacy, but their argu - ment reduces itself to a gallant wish.

<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>he stain of his birth, if any there be.” Under his father’s tutelage
and Sandro’s he learned the painter’s art so rapidly that already at
twenty -three he produced in The Vision of St. Bernard a portrait that
in Vasari’s judg - ment “lacked only speech.” When the Carmelite monks
decided to com - plete the frescoes begun in their Brancacci Chapel
sixty years before, they awarded the commission to Filippino, still but
twenty-seven. The result did not equal Masaccio, but in St. Paul
Addressing St. Peter in Prison Filippino achieved a memorable figure of
simple dignity and quiet power.</p>
<p>In 1489, at Lorenzo’s suggestion, Cardinal Caraffa called him to Rome
to decorate a chapel in Santa Maria sopra Minerva with scenes from the
life of St. Thomas Aquinas. In the main fresco the artist, perhaps
recalling a similar picture by Andrea da Firenze a century before,
showed the phi- losopher in triumph, with Arius, Averroes, and other
heretics at his feet; meanwhile, in the universities of Bologna and
Padua, the doctrines of Averroes were gaining ground over the orthodox
faith. Back in Florence, in the chapel of Filippo Strozzi in Santa Maria
Novella, Filippino recorded the careers of the Apostles Philip and John
in frescoes so realistic that legend told how a boy tried to hide a
secret treasure in a hole that Filippino had represented in a pictured
wall. Interrupting this series for a time, and replacing the dilatory
Leonardo, he painted an altarpiece for the monks of Scopeto; he chose
the old subject of the Magi adoring the Child, but enlivened it with
Moors, Indians, and many Medici; one of these last, serv- ing as an
astrologer with a quadrant in his hands, is among the most human and
humorous portraits of the Renaissance. Finally (1498), as if to say that
his father’s sins had been forgiven, Filippino was invited to Prato to
paint a Madonna; Vasari praised it, the Second World War destroyed it.
He settled down to marriage at forty, and knew for a few years the joys
and tribulations of parentage. Suddenly, at forty-seven, he died of so
simple an ailment as quinsy sore throat (1505).</p>

<li>LORENZO PASSES</li>
</ol>
<p>Lorenzo himself was not among the few who in those centuries reached
old age. Like his father he suffered from arthritis and gout, to which
was added a stomach disorder that frequently caused him exhausting pain.
He tried a dozen remedies, and found nothing better than the passing al-
leviation given by warm mineral baths. For some time before his death he
perceived that he, who had preached the gospel of joy, had not much
longer to live.</p>
<p>THE GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>I 4 I</p>
<p>His wife died in 1488; and though he had been unfaithful to her
he</p>
<p>sincerely mourned her loss and missed her helping hand. She had given
him a numerous progeny, of whom seven survived. He had sedulously
supervised their education; and in his later years he labored to guide
them into marriages that might redound to the happiness of Florence as
well as their own. The oldest son, Piero, was affianced to an Orsini to
win friends in Rome; the youngest, Giuliano, married a sister of the
duke of Savoy, received from Francis I the title of duke of Nemours, and
so helped to build a bridge between Florence and France. Giovanni, the
second son, was directed into an ecclesiastical career, and took to it
amiably; he pleased everyone by his good nature, good manners, and good
Latin. Lorenzo persuaded Innocent VIII to violate all precedents by
making him a cardinal at fourteen; the Pope yielded for the same reason
that made most marriages of royalty — to bind one government to another
in the amity of one blood.</p>
<p>Lorenzo retired from active participation in the government of
Florence, delegated more and more of his public and private business to
his son Piero, and sought comfort in the peace of the countryside and
the conversation of his friends. He excused himself in a characteristic
letter.</p>
<p>What can be more desirable to a well-regulated mind than the enjoy-
ment of leisure with dignity? This is what all good men wish to</p>
<p>obtain, but which great men alone accomplish. In the midst of</p>
<p>public affairs we may indeed be allowed to look forward to a day</p>
<p>of rest; but no rest should totally seclude us from an attention to
the concerns of our country. I cannot deny that the path which it
has</p>
<p>been my lot to tread has been arduous and rugged, full of
dangers,</p>
<p>and beset with treachery; but I console myself in having contributed
to the welfare of my country, the prosperity of which may now</p>
<p>rival that of any other state, however flourishing. Nor have I
been</p>
<p>inattentive to the interests and advancement of my own family,</p>
<p>having always proposed to my imitation the example of my grand-</p>
<p>father Cosmo, who watched over his public and private concerns</p>
<p>with equal vigilance. Having now obtained the object of my cares,</p>
<p>I trust I may be allowed to enjoy the sweets of leisure, to share
the</p>
<p>reputation of my fellow-citizens, and to exult in the glory of my</p>
<p>native place.</p>
<p>But little time was left him to enjoy his unaccustomed peace. He had
hardly moved to his villa at Careggi (March 21, 1492) when his stomach
pains became alarmingly intense. Specialist physicians were summoned,
who made him drink a mixture of jewels. He became rapidly worse, and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>reconciled himself to death. He expressed to Pico and Politian his
sorrow that he could not live long enough to complete his collection of
manu- scripts for their accommodation and the use of students. As the
end ap- proached he sent for a priest, and with his last strength
insisted on leaving his bed to receive the sacrament on his knees. He
thought now of the uncompromising preacher who had denounced him as a
destroyer of liberty and a corrupter of youth, and he longed to have
that man’s for - giveness before he died. He despatched a friend to beg
Savonarola to come to him to hear his confession and give him a more
precious absolution. Savonarola came. According to Politian he offered
absolution on three conditions: that Lore nzo should have a lively faith
in God’s mercy, should promise to mend his life if he recovered, and
should meet death with fortitude; Lorenzo agreed, and was absolved.
According to Savonarola’s early biographer, G. F. Pico (not the
humanist), the third condition was that Lorenzo should promise “to
restore liberty to Florence”; in Pico’s ac - count Lorenzo made no
response to this demand, and the friar left him unabsolved. 84 On April
9, 1492, Lorenzo died, aged forty-three.</p>
<p>When the news of this premature death reached Florence almost the
entire city mourned, and even Lorenzo’s opponents wondered how social
order could now be maintained in Florence, or peace in Italy, without
his guiding hand. 35 Europe recognized his stature as a statesman, and
sensed in him the characteristic qualities of the time; he was “the man
of the Renaissance” in everything but his aversion to violence. His
slowly ac - quired prudence in policy, his simple but persuasive
eloquence in debate, his firmness and courage in action, had made all
but a few Florentines for- get the liberty that his family had
destroyed; and many who had not for- gotten remembered it as the freedom
of rich clans to compete in force and chicanery for an exploitive
dominance in a “democracy” wher e only a thirtieth of the population
could vote. Lorenzo had used his power with moderation and for the good
of the state, even to the neglect of his private fortune. He had been
guilty of sexual looseness, and had given a bad ex-. ample to Florentine
youth. He had given a good example in literature, had restored the
Italian language to literary standing, and had rivaled his proteges in
poetry. He had supported the arts with a discriminating taste that set a
standard for Europe. Of all the “despots” he was the gentlest and the
best. “This man,” said King Ferdinand of Naples, “lived long</p>
<p>enough for his glory, but too short a time for Italy.” 38 After him
Florence declined, and Italy knew no peace.</p>
