<h4 id="chapter-xii">CHAPTER XII</h4>
<p>The Struggle for the Baltic</p>
<p>1648 — 1721</p>
<p>I. ADVENTUROUS SWEDEN: 1648-1700</p>
<p>H ISTORY is a fragment of biology — the human moment in the</p>
<p>pageant of species. It is also a child of geography — the operation
of land and sea and air, and of their forms and products, upon human
desire and destiny. See again the confrontation of countries around the
Baltic in the seventeenth century: on its north, Sweden; on its east,
Esthonia, Livonia, Lithuania, and, behind them, cold and hungry Russia;
on its south, East Prussia, Poland, West Prussia, Germany; and on its
west, Denmark, with its strategic place on the narrow outlets of the
Baltic to the North Sea and the Atlantic. This was a geographical
prison, whose inmates would struggle to control those waters and
straits, those coasts and ports, those avenues of commerce and escape by
land or sea. Here geography created history.</p>
<p>Denmark played now a minor role in the Baltic drama. Its freedom-</p>
<p>monopolizing nobles had tied the hands and feet of its kings. It had
sur- rendered control of the Skagerrak and the Kattegat (1645); it still
held Norway, but in 1660 it lost the southern provinces of Sweden.
Frederick III ( 1 648-70) felt the need of a centralized authority to
meet external chal- lenges, and with the help of the clergy and the
middle classes he compelled the nobles to yield him absolute and
hereditary power. His son Christian V (1670-99) found in Peder
Schumacher, Count Griff enfeld, an aide who won the praise of Louis XIV
as one of the ablest ministers in that heyday of diplomacy. The finances
were reformed, trade and industry were ad- vanced, the army and navy
were reorganized. The Count pursued a policy of peace, but the new King
longed to recover the power and provinces that Denmark had once held. In
1675 he renewed the old conflict with Sweden. He was defeated, and the
sovereignty of Sweden in Scandinavia was con- firmed.</p>
<p>Sweden in this period had a remarkable succession of strong kings;
for half a century (1654-1718) they were the wonder of the world,
rivaled only by Louis XIV. Had they possessed a larger background of
resources they might have equaled the power of France, and the Swedish
people, inspired by the achievements of two Gustavs, three Karls, and
their great ministers, might have financed a cultural flowering
commensurate with</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>3 66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>their victories and aspirations. But the wars that exalted their
power ex- hausted their wealth, and Sweden emerged from this age heroic
but con- sumed. It is astonishing that a nation so weak should have
accomplished so much abroad. She had a population of 1,500,000, divided
into classes that had not yet learned to live with one another in peace.
The nobles dominated the king, and voted themselves crown lands on easy
terms. Industry was so bound and narrowed to the needs of war that it
could not feed the com- merce that war had freed. Foreign possessions
were a proud liability. Only the statesmanship of devoted ministers
staved off the bankruptcy that seemed to be the price of glory.</p>
<p>Charles X Gustavus was the cousin, playmate, lover, and successor of
the redoubtable Christina, who had resigned the throne to him in 1654.
He met the danger of bankruptcy by compelling the nobles to disgorge
some of the royal estates that they had absorbed. By this “reduction” of
seignorial holdings the state regained three thousands homesteads, and
solvency. To supplement the coinage of silver and gold, Charles
commissioned Johann Palmstruh to establish a national bank and issue
paper money (1656) — the first such currency in Europe. For a while the
increased circulation stimu- lated the economy, but the bank issued more
paper than it could redeem on demand, and the experiment was
discontinued. About the same time the enterprising monarch transplanted
the iron and steel industry of Riga to Sweden, and so laid the
foundations of a stronger industrial basis for his martial policy.</p>
<p>His aim was frankly expansionist. The principalities that
Gustavus</p>
<p>Adolphus had won on the mainland were threatening revolt. The Polish
government had refused to recognize Charles X as King of Sweden, but
Poland was weakened by the Cossack rebellion. Russia had come to the aid
of the Cossacks, and was obviously hoping to cut a way to the Baltic.
Sweden had a well-trained army, which it feared to demobilize and could
best support by victorious war. All the conditions, in Charles’s
view,</p>
<p>favored an attack upon Poland. The peasants and the clergy objected;
he won them over by calling his enterprise a holy war to protect and
extend the Reformation (1655). 1</p>
<p>Poland proved easy to invade, difficult to subdue. Disordered and
assailed in the east, it made little resistance in the west. Charles
entered Warsaw, appeased the Polish nobles by promising to preserve
their traditional privi- leges, received the homage of the Polish
Protestants, and the offer of the Lithuanians to acknowledge his
sovereignty. When Frederick William, the “Great Elector” of Brandenburg,
tried to profit from Poland’s collapse by seizing West Prussia (then a
Polish fief), Charles marched his army west- ward with Napoleonic
celerity, besieged the Elector in his capital, and forced him to sign
the Treaty of Konigsberg (January, 1656). The Elector</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>did homage to Charles for East Prussia as a Swedish fief, agreed to
turn over to Sweden half of that province’s customs and dues, and
promised to supply fifteen hundred soldiers to the Swedish army.</p>
<p>The religious issue which Charles had raised defeated him. Pope Alex-
ander VII and the Emperor Ferdinand III used all their influence to
raise up an anti-Swedish coalition; even the Protestant Danes and Dutch
joined in the resolve to check the young conqueror lest he should next
impinge upon their territory or trade. He rushed back to Poland,
defeated a new Polish force, and reoccupied Warsaw (July, 1656). But now
the country, religiously aroused, took up arms against him, and Charles,
triumphant but friendless, found himself hemmed in by foes. The Elector
of Brandenburg deserted him and pledged aid to Poland. Knowing only how
to win battles, not how to consolidate his conquests in a practicable
peace, Charles swept westward against Denmark, crossed the Kattegat over
thirteen miles of ice (January, 1658), defeated the Danes, and compelled
Frederick III to sign the Peace of Roskilde (February 27). Denmark
withdrew completely from the Swedish peninsula, and agreed to close the
Sound against Sweden’s enemies. When the Danes delayed to carry out
these terms Charles renewed the war, and besieged Copenhagen. Now he
resolved to dethrone Frederick III and reunite Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway under one crown.</p>
<p>He was defeated by sea power. The two great naval nations of the age,
England and the United Provinces, normally enemies, agreed that no
country should hold the key to the Baltic by controlling the Sound
between Denmark and Sweden. In October a Dutch squadron forced its
way</p>
<p>through the Sound, relieved Copenhagen, and drove the small Swedish
fleet into its home ports. Charles vowed to fight to the last. But the
rigors of his campaigns had told upon him. While he was addressing the
Swedish Diet at Goteborg he was seized with fever. He died shortly
thereafter (Febru- ary 13, 1660), in the prime of his life.</p>
<p>As his son Charles XI (1660-97) was only five years old, a Regency of
nobles took charge, and brought the war to a close with the Peace of
Oliva and the Treaty of Copenhagen (May, June, 1660). The Polish
monarchy surrendered its claim to the Swedish crown; Livonia was
confirmed to Sweden; Brandenburg received full title to East Prussia;
Sweden retained her southern counties (Skane) and her mainland provinces
(Bremen, Verden, and Pomerania), but she joined Denmark in guaranteeing
the access of foreign vessels to the Baltic. A year later Sweden and
Poland signed at Kardis a halfhearted peace with the Czar. For fifteen
years the struggle for the Baltic proceeded by other means than war.</p>
<p>These treaties were a substantial victory for Sweden, but she was
again verging on bankruptcy. Two members of the Regency, Gustav Bonde
and Per Brahe, labored to check governmental expenditures, but Magnus de
la</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Gardie, the Chancellor, added new debts to old ones, allowed the
nobility, his friends, and himself to profit at the expense of the
treasury, and, for a subsidy, allied Sweden with France (1672) only a
few days before Louis XIV pounced upon Sweden’s ally, the United
Provinces. Soon Sweden</p>
<p>The young Charles XI, taking control, rescued Sweden by a series
of</p>
<p>campaigns in which his personal bravery so inspired his troops that
they routed the Danes at Lund and Landskrona. Through these victories,
and support by Louis XIV, Sweden recovered all that she had lost. A new
hero of Swedish diplomacy, Count Johan Gyllenstierna, co-operated with
Count Griffenfeld to arrange at Lund (1679) not on ty peace but a
military and commercial alliance between Sweden and Denmark. They agreed
to a common coinage, and the union of all Scandinavia was close to
complete when the death of Gyllenstierna at the age of forty-five
(1680), interrupted this development. The two nations preserved the
peace for twenty years.</p>
<p>Gyllenstierna had taught the young King that Sweden would be unable
to maintain her status as a great power if her nobles continued to
absorb crown lands, thereby depressing the monarchy to poverty and the
state to impotence. In 1682 Charles XI took decisive action. Supported
by the clergy, the peasants, and the burghers, he resumed with angry
thoroughness the “reduction,” or restoration, of alienated royal
estates. He investigated and punished official corruption, and brought
the revenues of the govern- ment to a point where Sweden was again able
to maintain her possessions and responsibilities. Charles XI was not a
very lovable king, but he was a great one. Though he made an enviable
record in war, he preferred the less noisy victories of peace. He
established monarchical absolutism, but that was then the alternative to
a chaotic and retrogressive feudalism.</p>
<p>In the calm of this lucid interval science, literature, and art
flourished in Sweden. Swedish architecture reached its zenith in the
erection of the massive and majestic royal palace at Stockholm, designed
(1693-97) by Nicodemus Tessin. Lars Johansson was both the Leopardi and
the Marlowe of Sweden, singing melodious misanthropy, and stabbed to
death in a tavern brawl at the age of thirty- six. Gunno Dahlstierna
composed in Dante’s meter an epic, Kunga-Skald (1697), in honor of
Charles XI. The King died in that year, after saving and rebuilding a
Sweden that his more famous son almost destroyed.</p>
<p>Charles XII was now fifteen. As the map of Europe was being remade by
blood and iron, he had been trained above all for war. All his sports
pre- pared him for martial deeds; he learned mathematics as a branch of
military</p>
<p>CHAP, xn) THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC 369</p>
<p>science; and he read enough Latin to derive from Qintus Curtius’
biography of Alexander the ambition to excel in arms, if not to conquer
the world. Tall, handsome, strong, with no surplus ounce of flesh to
burden him, he enjoyed a soldier’s life, bore its privations stoically,
laughed at danger and death, and demanded the same hardihood of his
troops. He cared little for women, and though often courted, he never
married. He hunted bears with no other weapon than a heavy wooden fork;
rode his horses at reckless speed, swam in waters that were half covered
with ice, and relished sham battles in which, time and again, he and his
friends were nearly killed. Along with fanatical bravery and physical
stamina went certain qualities of char- acter and intellect: a candor
scorning the tricks of diplomacy; a sense of honor blemished by
exceptional moments of wild cruelty; a mind clear to see the point of a
matter at once, but impatient of indirect approaches in thought or
strategy; a taciturn pride that never forgot his royal birth and never
acknowledged defeat. At his coronation he crowned himself, Na-
poleonwise; he took no oath limiting his power; and when a clergyman
questioned the wisdom of conferring absolute authority upon a youth of
fifteen, Charles at first condemned him to death, then commuted the sen-
tence to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>At his accession Sweden was a major Continental power, ruling
Finland, Ingria, Esthonia, Livonia, Pomerania, and Bremen; she
controlled the Baltic, and kept Russia from access to that sea. Russia,
Poland, Brandenburg, and Denmark saw in the youthfulness of the Swedish
King an opportunity to extend their boundaries to the advantage of their
commerce and reve- nues. The catalytic agent in this geographical
solution was a Livonian knight, Johann von Patkul. As a subject of
Sweden he had entered its army and had risen to a captaincy. In 1689 and
1692 he protested so forcefully against Charles XI’s “reduction” of
estates in Livonia that he was charged</p>

<li>POLAND AND SOBIESKI: 1 648-99</li>
</ol>
<p>Two events at the outset of this period deeply influenced Polish
history. In 1652, for the first time, a single member of the Sejm
defeated a measure by exercising the liberum veto, which allowed any
delegate in that parlia-</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>ment to overrule any majority. Formerly the consent of all the
provinces had been required for the passage of any measure, and
sometimes a small minority had made legislation impossible; but no
individual had yet asserted the right to veto a proposal acceptable to
all the rest. Forty-eight of the fifty- five sessions of the Sejm after
1652 were “exploded” or terminated by the “free veto” of a single
deputy. The plan supposed that no majority could justly override a
minority, however small. It rose not out of popular theory but out of
feudal pride; every landowner considered himself su- preme on his lands.
The result was a maximum of local independence and collective futility.
As the kings were subject to the Sejm, and this to the liberum veto , a
consistent national policy was usually impossible. Nine years after that
first veto King John Casimir made a remarkable prediction to the
Sejm:</p>
<p>Would God I may prove a false prophet! But I tell you that if you</p>
<p>do not find a remedy for the present evil 〔the liberum veto〕
the</p>
<p>republic will become the prey of foreign countries. The
Muscovites</p>
<p>will attempt to detach our Russian Palatinates perhaps as far as
the</p>
<p>Vistula. The House of Prussia . . . will try to seize Great
Poland.</p>
<p>Austria will hurl herself upon Cracow. Each of these Powers will</p>
<p>prefer to partition Poland rather than possess the whole of it
with</p>
<p>such liberties as it enjoys today. 2</p>
<p>This prediction was almost literally fulfilled.</p>
<p>Next only to this veto in historical importance was the revolt of the
Cossacks in the Ukraine (1648). The consolidation of Lithuania with
Poland in the Union of Lublin (1569) had brought under chiefly Polish
rule the Dnieper region of the Ukraine, largely peopled by Zaporogue
Cossacks accustomed to independence and war. Polish nobles, buying land
in this western Ukraine, sought to establish feudal conditions there,
and Polish Catholics discouraged the exercise of that freedom which the
Union of Lublin had guaranteed to the Orthodox worship. Out of a now
inextricable complex of dissatisfactions a Cossack rebellion took form,
led for a time by a rich hetman, Bogdan Chmiel- nicki, and supported by
the Moslem Tatars of the Crimea. On May 26, 1648, the Cossacks and the
Tatars routed the main Polish army at Korsun, and enthusiasm for the
revolt spread among rich and poor alike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the death of Ladislas IV on May 20 had left the throne of
Poland to noble debate that lasted till November 20, when the electoral
Diet chose John II Casimir. Chmielnicki, fearing that the revolt could
maintain itself against renewed Polish armies only by accepting alien
aid and suzerainty, cast in his lot with Orthodox Russia. He offered the
Ukraine to Czar Alexis; the Russian government, quite aware that this
meant war with Poland, welcomed the offer; and by the “Act of
Pereyaslav”, January 18, 1654, the Ukraine</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>passed under Russian rule. The region was guaranteed local autonomy
under a hetman elected by the Cossacks and ratified by the Czar.</p>
<p>In the ensuing war between Poland and Russia the Crimean Tatars,
preferring a Polish to a Russian Ukraine, shifted their aid from the
Cossacks to the Poles. On August 8, 1655, the Russians took Wilno,
massacred thousands of the in- habitants, and burned the city to the
ground. While the Poles defended them- selves on their eastern front,
Charles X led a Swedish army into western Poland and took Warsaw
(September 8). Polish resistance to him collapsed. The Polish gentry,
even the Polish army, paid homage and swore allegiance to the conqueror.
3 Cromwell sent him congratulations on having seized one of the pope’s
horns, 4 and Charles assured the Protector that soon there would not be
a papist left in Poland; 5 nevertheless he promised religious toleration
in Poland.</p>
<p>His plans were frustrated by his victorious army. Escaping control,
it pillaged towns, massacred inhabitants, despoiled churches and
monasteries. The famous Monastery of Jasna Gora, near Czestochowa,
stoutly resisted siege; this success, regarded as a miracle, aroused the
religious ardor of the populace; the Catholic priests appealed to the
nation to expel the impious invaders; peasants led the way in taking up
arms; the garrison that Charles had left in Warsaw fled before the
advancing crowd; John Casimir was restored to his capital (June 16,
1656). The Tatars turned against Russia, and Russia, preferring Poland
to Sweden as a neighbor, signed a truce with Poland (1656). The sudden
death of Charles X led to the Peace of Oliva (May 3, 1660), ending the
war between Poland and Sweden. In 1659 the struggle with Russia was
resumed. After eight years of chaos, campaigns, and vacillations of
Cossack loyalty, the Peace of Andrusovo (January 20, 1667) ceded
Smolensk, Kiev, and the Ukraine east of the Dnieper to Russia. This
division of the Ukraine endured till the first partition of Poland</p>
<p>( 1 77 2 )*</p>
<p>Tired of war and the liberum veto, John Casimir abdicated the Polish
throne (1668), retired to Nevers in France, and lived a quiet life of
study and prayer until his death (1672). His successor, Michael
Wisniowieclu, fought a disastrous war with the Turks; by the Peace of
Buczacz (1672) Poland acknowledged Turkish sovereignty over the western
Ukraine, and pledged an annual tribute of 220,000 ducats to the sultans.
In that war Poland discovered the military genius of Jan Sobieski; and
when Wisnio- wiecki died (1673), the Diet, after the usual costly delay,
elected Polan d’s greatest King (1674).</p>
<p>Jan — now John III — was already forty-four years old. He had had a
propitious origin as son of the castellan (military governor) at Cracow;
his mother was the granddaughter of the Polish general Stanislas
Zolkiewski who had captured Moscow in 1610; Jan had arms in his blood.
Education at the University of Cracow, travels in Germany, the
Netherlands, England, and France, with almost a year in Paris, made him
a man of culture as well as of martial courage and skill. In 1648 his
father died, shortly after being</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>chosen to represent Poland at the Peace of Westphalia. Jan hurried
home, and joined the Polish army in action against the Cossack revolt.
When the Swedes invaded Poland, and John Casimir fled, Sobieski was
among the many Polish officials who accepted Charles X as King of
Poland, and for a year he served in the Swedish army. But when the Poles
rose against the invaders Sobieski came back to his national allegiance,
and fought so well for his country that in 1665 he was made commander in
chief of the Polish armies. In that year he married the remarkable woman
who became half of his life and molder of his career.</p>
<p>Maria Kazimiera, of royal French blood, was born at Nevers in 1641,
and brought up in France and Poland. At Warsaw, when she was thirteen,
her vivacious beauty inflamed Sobieski, then twenty-five. But the
fortunes of war took him away, and when he returned he found her married
to Jan Zamojski, a noble debauchee. Neglected by her husband, Maria
accepted Sobieski as her cavaliere servente. Apparently she kept her
marriage vows, but she promised to marry Sobieski as soon as she could
have her union with Zamojski annulled. The husband made this unnecessary
by dying; the lovers were soon wed; and their long love became a legend
in Polish history. Many Polish women rivaled the French in combining
classic beauty of features with an almost masculine courage and
intelligence, and a penchant for making or guiding kings. From the day
of their marriage Maria began to plan the elevation of Sobieski to the
throne.</p>
<p>Her love was sometimes unscrupulous, as love can be. In 1669 Sobieski
seems to have accepted French money to support a French cardinal against
Wisniowiecki. After Michael’s election Jan joined other nobles in plots
to depose the King as a coward unfit and unwilling to defend Poland
against the Turks. He himself led his men to four victories within ten
days. On November 1 1, 1673, the day of the King’s death, Sobieski
routed the Turks at Khotin in Bessarabia. The achievement made him a
logical candidate for a throne that only the most resolute arms could
now maintain against foes on every side. To reinforce logic he appeared
at the electoral Diet at the head of six thousand troops. French money
played a part in his election, but this was quite in the mores of the
age.</p>
<p>He was a king in body and soul as well as in name. Foreigners
described him as “one of the handsomest and best - built men” in Europe,
“of proud and noble visage, eyes of light and fire,” 6 physically
strong, venereally assiduous, mentally curious and alive. His natural
acquisitiveness was spurred by the extravagance of his beloved
Marysienka, but he often atoned for a parsimonious Sejm by paying his
soldiers out of his own pocket, and selling his property to buy them
guns. 7 He deserved all that he took, for he saved both Poland and
Europe.</p>
<p>His foreign policy was simple in aim: to drive the Turks into Asia,
or at least to repel their attacks upon the bastion of Western
Christendom at</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>Vienna. In this effort he was harassed by the alliance of his ally
France with the Sultan, and by the attempts of the Emperor to embroil
him in Turkish wars; Leopold I hoped thus to leave Austria free to
appropriate Danubian or Hungarian territory to which both Austria and
Poland laid claim.</p>
<p>Treading angrily through the maze, Sobieski longed for the freedom to
plan policy and issue directives without being subject at every step to
the Sejm and the liberum veto. He envied the power of Louis XIV and the
Emperor to make decisions definitely and to issue orders accordingly and
immediately.</p>
<p>Soon after his election he undertook to recover the western Ukraine
from the Turks, who had now advanced as far north as Lvov. There, with
only five thousand cavalry, he defeated twenty thousand Turks (August
24, 1675). By the Treaty of Zuravno (October 17, 1676) he compelled the
Turks to surrender their claim to tribute, and to acknowledge Polish
suzerainty in the western Ukraine. He felt that the opportunity had come
to expel the Ottoman power from Europe. He appealed to Leopold to join
with him in war a Foutrance against the Turks; but Leopold objected that
he had no assurance that if he sent his armies to the east, Louis XIV
would not attack him in the west. Sobieski begged France to give Austria
such assurance; Louis refused. 8 Sobieski turned more and more toward
alliance with Austria. When French agents tried to bribe the Sejm
against him, he exposed their plot and published their secret
correspondence. In the re- sultant reaction against France the Sejm
signed (April 1, 1683) an alliance with the Empire. Poland was to raise
forty thousand men, the Empire sixty thousand. If Vienna or Cracow
should be besieged by the Turks, the other ally would come to the rescue
with his entire force.</p>
<p>In July the Turks moved toward Vienna. In August Sobieski and the</p>
<p>Polish army left Warsaw with the declared purpose “to proceed to
the</p>
<p>1683). Half of the twenty-five thousand Poles who had followed him in
the crusade died in battle or on the way.</p>
<p>He returned to Poland in triumph and disappointment. Warsaw received
him proudly as the hero of Europe, but he had been rebuffed by the Em-
peror in his hopes of marrying his son to the Archduchess of Austria. To
secure a kingdom for his son he attempted the conquest of Moldavia; he
won all the battles except against weather and accident, and came back
empty-handed.</p>
<p>Amid the turmoil of politics, and in the intervals of war, he made
his</p>
<p>374</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>court the center of a cultural revival. He himself was a man of wide
read- ing: he had studied Galileo and Harvey, Descartes and Gassendi, he
had read Pascal, Corneille, and Moliere. While supporting the Catholic
Church as a matter of state policy, he extended religious freedom and
protection to Protestants and Jews; 10 the Jews loved him as they had
loved Caesar. He had the will, but not the power, to save from death a
freethinker who had ex- pressed some doubts as to the existence of God
(1689); 11 this was the first auto-da-fe in Polish history. Poland
continued to produce her own poets, but to import most of her major
artists. Waclaw Potocki wrote an epic on the Polish victory at Khotin;
Wespazian Kochowski composed similar epics, and a Polish psalmody in
poetic prose; and Andrzej Morsztyn, after translating Tasso’s Aminta and
Corneille’s Cid, showed in his lyrics the influence of French and
Italian poetry in Poland. Sobieski encouraged the French influence,
admiring everything in France except its politics. He brought French and
Italian painters and sculptors to work in Warsaw. He engaged architects,
chiefly Italian, to build baroque palaces at Wilanow, Zolkiew, and
Jaworow. Sumptuous churches were erected during his reign: St. Peter’s
in Wilno, and in Warsaw the churches of the Holy Cross and the
Benedictine nuns. Andreas Schliiter came from Germany to carve decora-
tion for the palace at Wilanow and the Krasinski Palace in the capital.
Amid these Western influences in art, Eastern influence predominated in
dress and appearance: the long cloak and the broad and colorful
waistband, and mustaches turned up like double scimitars.</p>
<p>The old age of the King was darkened by the rebelliousness of his son
Jakob, the intransigence of his wife, and his failure to have the
monarchy made hereditary in his family. The liberum veto stood always
over his head. He could not improve the condition of the peasants, for
their masters domi- nated the Sejm; he could not compel the rich to pay
taxes, for the rich were the Sejm; he could not keep the factious nobles
in order, for they refused him a standing army. He died of uremia on
June 17, 1696, not, as story has it, brokenhearted, but saddened by the
decline of his beloved country from the pinnacle of heroism to which he
had raised it.</p>
<p>The Diet passed over his son and sold the crown to Frederick
Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who easily transformed himself from a
Protestant to a Catholic to become Augustus II of Poland. He was a
character in his own right. History calls him Augustus the Strong, for
he was an athlete in body and bed; legend credits him with 354
illegitimate children. 12 In January, 1699, he signed at Karlowitz a
treaty by which Turkey yielded all claim to the western Ukraine. Feeling
safe now in south and east, Augustus listened to Patkul, and allied
Poland with Denmark and Russia for the partition of Sweden.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>in. RUSSIA TURNS WEST: 1 645-99</p>
<p>Each of the conspirators could allege some excuse and provocation.
Sweden’s Charles X had besieged Copenhagen and tried to conquer Den -
mark. He had invaded Poland and captured her capital; and Gustavus
Adolphus had so strengthened Swedish power in Livonia and Ingria that he
could defy Russia to launch a boat on the Baltic without Sweden’s
consent. The imprisoned Russian bear gnawed its claws at the sight of
all exits closed in the west, all outlets to the Black Sea shut off by
the Crimean Tatars and the Turks. Only eastward could Russia move — into
Siberia; and that seemed the way to hardships and barbarism. The
comforts and graces of life beckoned Russia to the west, and the West
was resolved to keep Russia Oriental.</p>
<p>When Alexis Mikhailovich Romanov became czar Russia was as yet</p>
<p>overwhelmingly medieval. She had not known Roman law, or Renaissance
humanism, or Reformation religious reform. Under Alexis Russian law
received a new formulation (the Ulozhenie of 1649), but this merely
codi- fied existing laws based on absolutism and orthodoxy. So it
remained a criminal offense to look at the new moon, or play chess, or
neglect church attendance, in Lent. These and a hundred other crimes
were punished by the knout. Alexis himself, though personally amiable
and generous, was fanatically pious; often he spent five hours a day in
church, making on one occasion fifteen hundred obeisances. 13 He
delighted in feeding the beggars who gathered around his palace, but he
punished severely all political or religious dissent, taxed his people
heavily, and allowed exploitation of the peasantry and corruption in the
government to go to such lengths that revolts broke out in Moscow,
Novgorod, and Pskov, and, above all, among the Cossacks of the Don. One
of these, Stenka Razin, formed a robber band, pillaged and killed the
rich and made himself master of Astrakhan and Tsaritsyn (now
Stalingrad). He set up a Cossack republic along the Volga, and at one
time threatened to take Moscow. He was captured and was tortured till he
died (1671), but his memory was cherished by the poor as a promise of
revenge against the landlords and the government.</p>
<p>Even in this medieval milieu some modem influences appeared. The wars
with Poland involved more frequent contacts with the West. Diplomats and
merchants came in rising number from what the Russians called “Europe.”
The River Dvina and the ports of Riga and Archangel saw in - creasing
trade with Western states. Foreign technicians were called in to develop
mines, organize industries, and manufacture armament. An entire colony
of immigrants grew up, about 1650, in a quarter of Moscow; Ger- mans and
Poles brought a touch of Western literature and music to this</p>
<p>376</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>settlement, and provided Latin tutors for rich Russian families.
Alexis him- self maintained a German orchestra. He allowed his minister
Artamon Matveev to import Western furniture and French manners, even to
the social mingling of women with men. When the Russian ambassador to
the Grand Duke of Tuscany sent Alexis descriptions of Florentine dramas,
operas, and ballets, Alexis allowed the building of a theater in Moscow
and the presentation of plays, chiefly Biblical; one of these, Esther ,
preceded Racine’s play of that name by seventeen years. Feeling that he
had sinned in attending these performances, Alexis mentioned them to his
confessor, who permitted him the new pleasures. 14 Matveev married a
Scottish lady of the famous Hamilton family; they adopted and brought up
a Russian orphan, Natalia Naruishkina; Alexis took her as his second
wife.</p>
<p>These Westernizing ventures aroused a patriotic reaction. Some Ortho-
dox Russians condemned the study of Latin as an evil thing that might
in- cline youth to un-Orthodox ideas. The older generation felt that any
change in customs, faith, or ritual dislodged some stone in the social
struc- ture, loosened all, and might in time bring the whole precarious
edifice down in ruins. Religion in Russia relied on liturgy as well as
doctrine. Though the masses had as yet a very limited capacity to
understand ideas, they could be trained in religious observances whose
hypnotic repetition made for social and mental stability and peace. But
the repetition had to be exact to produce the hypnotic effect; a change
in the accustomed sequence would break the soothing charm; hence every
detail of the ceremonial, every word of the prayers, had to remain as
they had been for centuries. One of the bitterest disputes and divisions
in Russian history came when Nikon, Patriarch of Moscow, introduced into
the liturgy some reforms based upon a study of Byzantine practices and
texts. Clerics who had learned Greek pointed out to the Patriarch many
errors in the texts used by the Russian Orthodox Church. Nikon ordered a
revision and correction of the texts and ritual: for example, Jesus was
henceforth to be Jisus, not Isus; the sign of the cross was to be made
with three fingers, not two; the number of genuflections during a
certain prayer were to be reduced from twelve to four; icons showing
Italian influence were to be destroyed and replaced by icons adhering to
Byzantine patterns. In general, Russian ritual was to be brought into
closer conformity with its Byzantine origins. Some Russian churchmen who
refused to accept these changes were demoted or anathematized or sent to
Siberia. Nikon’s dictatorial methods displeased the Czar, and in 1667 he
was banished to a remote monastery. The Russian Church split into two
factions; the official church, supported by Alexis, ac- cepted the
reforms; the dissenters (Raskolniki), or Old Believers (Staro- viertsi),
developed into a schismatic body, which the new orthodoxy persecuted
with fire and sword. Their leader, Awakum, was burned at the</p>
<p>CHAP. XII )</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>stake (1681) by order of Czar Feodor. Many Old Believers killed them-
selves rather than pay taxes to a government which they identified with
Antichrist. This religious chaos was part of the inheritance of Peter
the Great.</p>
<p>The death of Alexis (1676) prepared a violent conflict among his
chil- dren. By his first wife, Maria Miloslavski, he left an ailing son,
Feodor (born 1662), a lame, half -blind, and half -imbecile son, Ivan
(born 1666), and six daughters, of whom the ablest and most ambitious
was Sophia Alekseevna inborn 1657). By his second wife, Natalia
Naruishkina, Alexis begot the famous Peter (born 1672). Feodor inherited
the throne, but died in 1682. The boyars, judging Ivan helplessly
incompetent, wished to make Peter czar, with his mother as regent. But
Peter’s stepsisters hated Natalia, and feared to be neglected under her
rule. Led by Sophia, they stirred up the Streltsi — soldiers of the
Moscow garrison — to invade the Kremlin and insist upon the accession of
Ivan. Matveev, Natalia’s foster father, pleaded with the soldiers to
withdraw. They tore hi m from Peter’s grasp, killed him before the eyes
of the ten-year- old boy, killed Natalia’s brothers and several of her
supporters, and forced the boyars to accept Ivan as czar, with Peter as
co-czar but subordinate, and with Sophia as regent. These barbarities
may have shared in producing the convulsions that later disturbed
Peter’s life; in any case they gave him unforgettable lessons in
violence and bru- tality.</p>
<p>Natalia withdrew with Peter to Preobrazhensky, a suburb of Moscow.
Sophia governed well. She repudiated the isolation of the terem , or
women’s quarters; she appeared in public unveiled, and presided without
a qualm over male assemblies where old heads shook at such insolence.
She had received more education than most of the men around her; she was
inclined to reform, and to Western ideas; and she chose as her chief
minister, per- haps as her lover, a man much won to Western ways. Prince
Vasili Golitsyn wrote Latin, admired France, adorned his palace with
paintings and Gobelin tapestries, and had a large library of Latin,
Polish, and German books. It was apparently due to his example and
encouragement that three thousand stone dwellings were built in Moscow
in the seven years of his regency, whereas, before, all houses had been
of wood. He seems to have planned to free the serfs. 15 Under his rule
enslavement for debt was abolished, mur- derers were no longer buried
alive, and the death penalty for seditious utter- ances was abolished.
His work as a reformer was ruined by his failure as a general. He
reorganized the army and twice led it against the Turks; in both cases
he mismanaged the provisioning of the troops; they returned de- feated
and rebellious, and their disaffection gave Peter his cue to capture
power.</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>PETER LEARNING</li>
</ol>
<p>He had been receiving education from his mother, his tutors, and his
sallies into the streets of Moscow. He was not precocious, but he was
eager, curious, intelligent, fascinated by the mechanisms brought in
from the West — watches, weapons, tools, and instruments. He longed for
a Russia that would rival the West in industry and war. He loved to play
war games with his rough companions — raising, attacking, and defending
forts. Dream- ing of a Russian navy before Russia had touched an
ice-free sea, he built larger and larger boats, until he had to go
eighty miles from Moscow to find, at Pereslavl, a lake in which he could
set his little fleet afloat.</p>
<p>As he grew stronger he bore with rising impatience the ascendancy of
a stepsister who, with Vasili Golitsyn, had appropriated the authority
of both Ivan and himself. On July 18, 1689, Peter joined Ivan in the
procession that annually celebrated Moscow’s liberation from the Poles.
Contrary to cus - tom, Sophia walked in the procession. Peter, now
seventeen, commanded her to withdraw; she persisted; he left the city in
anger, and sought allies against the Regent. He found them in the
boyars, who had never reconciled themselves to being ruled by a woman,
and in the Streltsi, who, having suf- fered some rebuffs from Sophia,
were ready for stratagems and spoils. Boris Golitsyn, cousin to the
minister, set the coup d’etat in motion by sending a false message to
Peter that Sophia was planning to arrest him. Peter, fol- lowed by his
mother, his sister, and his recently acquired wife, fled to the
Troitsko-Sergievskaya Monastery, forty-five miles from Moscow. Thence he
sent orders to each colonel of the Streltsi to come to the Troitsko-
Sergievskaya. Sophia forbade them to obey, but many went. Soon the
leaders of the nobility came, and then Joachim, Patriarch of Moscow.
Vasili Golitsyn was summoned, submitted, and was exiled to a village
near Archangel. Several of Sophia’s supporters were captured; some were
tor - tured, some were put to death. Peter wrote to Ivan for permission
to take over the government; Ivan’s con sent was given or presumed.
Peter ordered Sophia to remove to a convent; she protested, rebelled,
yielded. She was provided with every comfort and many servants, but was
forbidden to leave the convent grounds. On October 16, 1689, Peter
entered Moscow, was welcomed by Ivan, and assumed supreme power. Ivan
gracefully re- tired from public life; and seven years later he
died.</p>
<p>Peter, however, was not yet ready to rule. He left the government to
the the illiberal and reactionary Boris Golitsyn, Joachim, and others,
while he himself spent much of his time in the foreign colony. There he
made new friends who strongly influenced his development. One was
Patrick Gordon, a Scot soldier of fortune who was now at fifty-five an
officer in the Russian</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>army; from him Peter learned more of the art of war. Another was
Francois Lefort, bom in Geneva, now at thirty-four a Russian major
general. His good looks, quick mind, and pleasant ways delighted the
young czar, who dined twice or thrice a week with him, to the dismay of
Muscovites, who regarded all foreigners as vicious heretics. Peter
preferred the company of these aliens to that of the Russians. They
seemed to be more civilized, though they drank as heavily; they far
excelled the Russians in industrial, scientific, and military knowledge;
and their talk and amusements were on a higher plane. Peter noted their
mutual toleration in religion — Gordon a Catholic, Lefort a Protestant —
and smilingly served as godfather for Cath- olic and Protestant children
at the baptismal font. From the Germans and {he Dutch he acquired enough
of their languages for his purposes.</p>
<p>These were to make Russia strong in war, and have her rival the West
in the arts of peace. He learned from the Dutch resident, Baron von
Keller, how the Hollanders maintained their wealth and power by building
good ships. He longed to find an outlet to the sea, and to build a
salt-water fleet. He had no such outlet except at Archangel, which was
icebound half the year. Nevertheless he made his way there in 1693; he
bought a Dutch man- of-war lying in the harbor; when he overcame his
fear of the sea and set forth on this vess el, he was drunk with
delight. “You shall command her,” he wrote to Lefort, “and I will serve
as a common sailor.” 16 He dressed himself like a Dutch sea captain, and
mingled happily with Dutch sailors in the wineshops of the port. The
salt air of that cold sea was a bracing breath from the West, from that
region of industry, power, science, and art which called to him ever
more and more temptingly.</p>
<p>There were two practicable ways to the West: one via the Baltic,
closed by Sweden and Poland, the other via the Black Sea, closed by
Tatars and Turks. The Tatars and Turks controlled at Azov the mouth of
the Don; they made repeated raids into Muscovite territory, capturing
Russians — sometimes twenty thousand in a year — to sell them as slaves
in Constan- tinople. In 1695 Peter ordered his army to graduate from
games to war, to march through the steppes, sail down the rivers, and
attack Azov. Three generals were in divided command — Golovin, Gordon,
Lefort; Peter humbly served as bombardier sergeant in the Preobrazhensky
regiment. The affair was badly managed, the troops were poorly
disciplined; after fourteen costly weeks the siege was abandoned, and
Peter returned to Moscow swearing that he would train a better army, and
try again.</p>
<p>At Voronezh he built a fleet of transports and men-of-war. In May,
1696, he sailed down the Don with 75,000 men, and resumed the siege of
Azov. In July, chiefly by the bravery of the Don Cossacks, the city was
taken. Peter at once ordered a large fleet to be built at Voronezh for
service on the Black Sea. All Russia, including the great landlords, was
taxed for the</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>purpose; workers were conscripted; foreign mechanics were brought in.
Fifty Russian nobles were sent at their own expense to Italy, Holland,
and England, to learn the art of building ships. On March 10, 1697,
Peter fol- lowed them.</p>
<p>Russia w ould have been horrified at the thought of its Czar going
abroad into lands soiled with heresy. Therefore he organized an embassy
of fifty- five nobles and two hundred attendants, led by Lefort, to
visit “Europe” and seek allies against the Turks. Among the fifty-five
emissaries was a non- commissioned officer answering only to the name
Peter Mikhailov, and using as a seal the image of a shipwright and the
inscription “My rank is that of a pupil, and I need masters.” 17 Once
outside Russia, Peter wore this incognito loosely. It was as Czar of
Russia that he was entertained by Elec- tor Frederick III of
Brandenburg, by King William III in England, by</p>
<p>Emperor Leopold I in Vienna. Even in his royal state he shocked the
courts by his rough manners and speech, his uncleanliness and
untidiness, and his aversion to the use of knives and forks. 18 But he
made his way.</p>
<p>The embassy encountered difficulties, which Peter never forgot,
in</p>
<p>moving through Swedish Livonia to Riga. Thence he hurried to Konigs-
berg, where he signed with the Elector a treaty of trade and friendship.
In Brandenburg he studied artillery and fortification with a Prussian
military engineer, who gave him a certificate of progress. At
Koppenbriigge Sophia, the widowed Electress of Hanover, and her daughter
Sophia Charlotte, Electress of Brandenburg, persuaded him and his suite
to dine and dance with them. The Dowager later described him:</p>
<p>The Czar is very tall, his features are fine, and his figure very
noble. He has great vivacity of mind, and a ready and just repartee. …
It could be wished that his manners were a little less rustic . . . He
was very gay, very talkative, and we established a great friendship for
each other. . . .</p>
<p>He told us that he worked in building ships, showed us his hands, and
made us touch the callous places that had been caused by work. . . .</p>
<p>He is a very extraordinary man. . . . He has a very good heart,
and</p>
<p>remarkably noble sentiments. . . . He did not get drunk in our
presence, but we had hardly left when the people of his suite made
ample</p>
<p>amends. . . . He is sensible to the charms of beauty, but … I
found</p>
<p>in him no disposition to gallantry. . . . The Muscovites, in
dancing,</p>
<p>took the whalebones of our corsets for our bones, and the Czar showed
his astonishment by saying that the German ladies had devilish hard
bones . 19</p>
<p>From Koppenbriigge the embassy sailed down the Rhine into Holland.
Leaving most of the group at Amsterdam, Peter and a few intimates went
on to Zaandam, then a great shipbuilding center (August 18, 1697);
even</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>3 8l</p>
<p>in Russia he had heard much about the skill of the shipwrights in
this picturesque town. In its streets he recognized a worker whom he had
known in Moscow, Gerrit Kist. Asking him to respect his incognito, Peter
proposed to live in Kist’s small wooden cottage. There he stayed for a
week, dressing in the garb of a Dutch workingman, spending his days in
watching the shipwrights at work, and finding time, at night, to make
love to a servant girl at the local inn. In later years Joseph II and
Napoleon visited the cottage as a shrine, Czar Alexander I decorated it
with a marble slab, and a Dutch poet inscribed on the wall a famous
line: “ Nic hts is den grooten man te kleivU’ (To a great man nothing is
too small). 20</p>
<p>Annoyed by the crowds that followed his every step at Zaandam, Peter
went back to Amsterdam and his embassy. He again insisted on being
incognito, but now he called himself “Carpenter Peter of Zaandam.” He
persuaded the Dutch East India Company to let him join its workers in
the shipyards at Oostenburg. There he labored for four months with ten
of his followers, helping to build and launch a ship. He allowed no
distinction to be made between himself and other workingmen, and he put
his shoulder to the timber like the rest. At night he studied geometry
and the theory of shipbuilding; his notebooks show how thorough these
studies were. He found time to visit factories, workshops, anatomical
museums, botanical gardens, theaters, and hospitals. He met the great
physician and botanist Boerhaave, studied microscopy with Leeuwenhoek,
and took the gentlemen of his suite into Boerhaave’s anatomical theater.
He took up military engineering with Baron van Coehorn, architecture
with Schynvoet,</p>
<p>mechanics with van der Heyden. He learned to pull teeth, and some of
his aides suffered under his zealous dentistry. He entered the homes of
the Dutch to study their family life and domestic arrangements. He
shopped in the markets, mingled with the people, marveled at their
various trades, learned to mend his own clothes and cobble his shoes. He
drank beer and wine with the Dutch in their saloons. Probably no man in
history has been more eager to absorb and savor life.</p>
<p>In all this activity he did not lose sight of Russia. He guided by
letter</p>
<p>the actions of its deputed government. He engaged, and sent to’
Russia, several naval captains, thirty-five lieutenants, seventy-two
pilots, fifty physicians, four cooks, 345 sailors; he dispatched to
Russia 260 cases of guns, sailcloth, compasses, whalebone, cork,
anchors, and tools, even eight blocks of marble for Russian sculptors to
work on. 21 His interest lagged when it came to the refinement of
manners, the graces of society, or the subtleties of thought; he had no
time for metaphysics, balls, or salons; in any case those intangibles
could wait. For the present his task was to introduce the crafts and
practical sciences of the West in to Russia “so that, having mastered
them thoroughly, we can, when we return, be victors over the</p>
<p>382 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>enemies of Jesus Christ” 22 — i.e., take Constantinople and let
Russia pass from its prison through the Bosporus into the world.</p>
<p>After four, months in Holland he asked William III if he might
visit</p>
<p>England, still semi-incognito. William sent the royal yacht to fetch
him. Peter arrived in London in January, 1698. Though it was winter,
he</p>
<p>frequented the docks and the naval establishments. He visited the
Royal Society and the Mint, where he may have met Newton. Evelyn turned
over his house and carefully groomed grounds at Deptford to Peter and
his staff; later the English government allowed Sir John £ 350 to repair
the damage done by the Russians. The Czar astonished his neighbors by
going to bed early, rising at four, and walking to the shipyards with an
ax over his shoulder and a pipe in his mouth. He made a mistress of a
leading actress, who complained that he underpaid her. He received the
degree of Doctor of Laws at Oxford, and attended Protestant services
with such decorum that parsons expected him to convert Russia to the
Reformation. Bishop Burnet worked upon him, found him curious but
noncommittal, and concluded that the Czar seemed “designed by nature
rather to be a ship- carpenter than a great prince.” 28</p>
<p>Having spent four months in England, Peter sailed back to Amsterdam,
rejoined his embassy, and moved on with it through Leipzig and Dresden
to Vienna (June 2 6 , 1698). Through an impatient month he labored in
vain to bring the Emperor into an alliance against Turkey. He was
pleasant to the Jesuits, who began to dream of a Roman Catholic Russia.
Then, just as he was about to leave for Venice, a message reached him
that the Streltsi were in revolt, and were threatening to seize Moscow
and the government. He started at once for Russia, but near Cracow he
received assurance that the revolt had been put down. At Rava he tarried
four days with Augustus II of Poland. He was surprised and delighted to
find a king who could match him in physical strength, wild hunting, and
hard drinking. They fell in love with each other, kissed, and debated
whether Sweden or Turkey should be die first victim of their friendship.
On September 4 Peter reached Moscow, after eighteen months of a journey
that in Macaulay’s judgment marked “an epoch in the his tory not only of
his own country, but … of the world.” 24 Russia had discovered Europe,
and Europe had discovered Russia. Leibniz began to study Russian.</p>
<p>But Peter was still a seventeenth-century Muscovite. He had never</p>
<p>forgiven the Streltsi their share in the murder of his uncles and
Matveev, and in the usurpation of power by Sophia. His plans for a new
army left no room for this troublesome Praetorian Guard. When he learned
that Sophia had from her convent negotiated with them to restore her to
power, that they had threatened Lefort and others of the “German

<p>love of the West, his fury became a convulsion of revenge. He ordered
a considerable number of the Streltsi to be tortured, with a view to
making them confess Sophia’s share in their uprising; they bore the most
terrible torments without implicating her. He had her attendants
tortured with the same end and result. Sophia was forced to take the
vows, and was closely confined in her convent, where she died six years
later. A thousand Streltsi were put to death; Peter executed five with
his own hand, and compelled his aides to do likewise; Lefort refused. By
1705 the Streltsi had disappeared from history.</p>
<p>Peter began at once to build a new army. The old one had been com-
posed of Streltsi, of foreign mercenaries, and of peasant levies raised
by noblemen. Peter replaced this motley with a standing army of 210,000
men by conscripting one man from every twenty peasant households. These
troops were dressed in “European” uniforms, and were drilled in the
tactics of the West. The term of service for all ranks was for life.
In</p>
<p>addition Peter called upon 100,000 Cossacks. Ships were hurriedly
built on lakes, rivers, seas; by 1705 the Russian navy had forty-eight
men-of-war, eight hundred smaller vessels, and 28,000 men.</p>
<p>All this was still in process, far from complete, when Patkul came to
Moscow and proposed that Peter join Frederick IV of Denmark and</p>
<p>Augustus II of Poland to drive Sweden from the mainland and wrest
from her the control of the Baltic. All those ships that were abuilding
longed for the sea. Preferably the warm Mediterranean — but the Turkish
Empire was still discouragingly strong, Constantinople was a hard nut to
crack, and Austria and France were now friends with the Turks. Russia
must look to the other door, must seek some outlet in the north. It was
untimely that S wedish envoys had just come to Moscow and had secured
Peter’s</p>

<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>V. CHARLES XII AND THE GREAT NORTHERN WAR: 1 7 00-2 1</p>
<p>Some inkling of the coalition agreement reached Stockholm. The royal
Council met to discuss measures of defense. The prevailing judgment was
that negotiations should be opened with one or another of the allies
with a view to a separate peace. Charles listened for a long time in
silence, then rose abruptly. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I have resolved
never to engage in an unjust war, but . . . never to conclude a just war
but by the ruin of my foes.” 25 He renounced all amusements, all
luxuries, all intercourse with women, all use of wine. His army and navy
were in readiness. With them he left Stockholm on April 24, 1700, to
begin one of the most spectacular military careers in history. He never
saw his capital again.</p>
<p>He attacked Denmark first, for he had to protect the southern
provinces of Sweden from Danish assaults while he faced Poland and
Russia. With characteristic daring and speed, over the protest of his
admiral, he led his ships across the eastern — supposedly unnavigable —
channel of the Sound, and landed in Sjaelland, only a few miles from
Copenhagen (August 4,</p>
<p>1700). The Danish King, Frederick IV, dreading the capture of his
capital, hastily signed the Peace of Travendal (August 18), paying an
indemnity of 200,000 rix-dollars, and swearing that he would never
attack Sweden.</p>
<p>In May, 1700, Augustus II tried to take Riga. He was defeated by the
seventy-five-year-old Swedish general Count Erik Dahlberg, who had
gained the title “the Vauban of Sweden” by his skill in
fortification.</p>
<p>Augustus, retreating, appealed to Peter to relieve him by invading
Ingria. Peter responded by ordering forty thousand men to besiege Narva.
Think- ing to help Dahlberg, Charles XII transported his army by sea to
Pemau (Pamu), on the Gulf of Riga; but finding that warrior victorious,
he</p>
<p>turned north, and marched through swamps and dangerous passes to
appear suddenly in the rear of Peter’s army. The Czar was surprised into
what</p>
<p>1700), the first setback in Peter’s adult career.</p>
<p>The Swedish generals urged Charles to march upon Moscow and finish
Peter. But his army was small, winter had begun, even the young
Napoleon’s courage must have hesitated before the engulfing distances of
Russia, and the problem of feeding his army in a hostile land. Moreover
(pledges being</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC 385</p>
<p>paper), could he trust the Danish King, or the Polish, not to invade
Sweden while its main army and leader were so far from home? After
reorganizing the government and defense of Livonia, Charles marched
south into Poland, occupied Warsaw without a struggle (1702) like his
grandfather forty- seven years earlier, deposed Augustus, and made
Stanislas Leszczynski King of Poland ( 1 704) . Each of the allies had
now been defeated; but the Russian bear had just begun to fight.</p>
<p>Peter had not only recovered from his fright, he had organized
and</p>
<p>equipped another army. To provide it with artillery, he ordered the
bells of the churches and monasteries to be melted down; three hundred
cannon were forged, and a school was set up to train artillerymen. Soon
the new levies were winning victories; Peter’s own battalion of
artillery led in capturing Nienskans, at the mouth of the Neva (1703);
and here at once the Czar began to build “Petersburg,” hardly realizing
as yet that this was to be his capital, but resolved that it should be
one portal to the sea. While Charles was busy in Poland, Peter came up
again before Narva. Charles had left too small a garrison there; the
great fortress was taken by assault (August 20, 1704); the victors
avenged the former failure with a frightful massacre, which Peter
finally stopped by killing twelve of the blood-maddened Russians with
his own hand.</p>
<p>In Poland the triumph of Charles seemed complete. The deposed</p>
<p>Augustus signed a treaty acknowledging Leszczynski as king,
renouncing his alliances against Sweden, and surrendering to Charles the
man who had first organized the coalition; Johann von Patkul was broken
on the wheel and then beheaded (1707). Peter found himself alone against
the young Swedish terror. He tried to bribe the English ministry to
arrange a peace, but it refused to interfere. Peter’s agent went
directly to Marlborough, who agreed to intercede in return for a
principality in Russia; 26 Peter offered him Kiev or Vladimir or
Siberia, a guarantee of fifty thousand thalers a year, and “a rock ruby
such as no European potentate possesses”; 27 but these negotiations fell
through. Western statesmen sympathized with Charles, despised Augustus,
feared Peter; some of them argued that if Russia were allowed to expand
westward, all Europe would soon tremble before a Slavic inundation.
28</p>
<p>On January 1, 1708, Charles crossed the Vistula on unsafe ice at
the</p>
<p>head of 44,000 men, half of them cavalry. He reached Grodno on the
twenty-sixth only two hours after Peter had abandoned it. The Czar had
decided on defense by depth and devastation; he ordered his armies to
re- treat, to draw Charles farther and farther into the Russian
mattress, and to burn all crops as they passed; he commanded the
peasants to hide their com in the earth or the snow, and scatter their
cattle in forests and swamps. He entrusted to the Cossack hetman Ivan
Mazeppa the defense of “Little</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XH</p>
<p>Russia” and the Ukraine. Mazeppa had been brought up as a page at the
Polish court; a Polish nobleman whom he had cuckolded had him bound
naked on a wild Ukrainian horse; the horse (as Byron was to tell) was
deliberately frightened by the cuts of a whip and the firing of a pistol
close to his ear; the steed rushed through thickets and woods to his
native haunts; Mazeppa, though torn and bloody, survived, and rose to be
leader of the Zaporogue Cossacks. He pretended loyalty to Peter, but
resented the Czar’s autocracy, and waited for a chance to revolt.
Hearing that Peter</p>
<p>It was probably that offer that led Charles to continue his reckless
march into Russia. The “scorched - earth” policy was having its effect;
the Swedes found nothing but charred wilderness in their path, and began
to starve. Charles had relied upon reinforcements from Riga; these tried
to reach him, but were half destroyed by the Russians on their way.
Charles hoped that Mazeppa would join him with provisions and the full
force of the Dnieper Cossacks; but Peter, suspecting treachery, sent an
army under Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov to arrest Mazeppa; the hetman,
surprised before he could raise his horsemen, fled to Charles at Horki,
bringing only thirteen hundred men. Charles marched south to capture
Mazeppa’s capital, Baturin, and its supplies; Menshikov reached it
first, burned the city to the ground, and appointed a hetman faithful to
Russia. Peter, using every weapon, discouraged the Cossacks from joining
the Swedes by manifestoes describing the invaders as heretics who “deny
the doctrines of the true</p>
<p>None came, and the winter of 1708-9 proved a terrible enemy to the
Swedes. It was especially severe everywhere in Europe: the Baltic froze
so deeply that heavily laden wagons crossed the Sound on the ice; in
Ger- many the fruit trees died; in France the Rhone, in Venice the
canals, were covered with ice. In the Ukraine snow blanketed the ground
from Oc- tober 1 to April 5; birds fell dead in their flight; saliva
congealed in its passage from the mouth to the ground; wine and spirits
froze into solid blocks; firewood would not bum in the open air; and the
wind cut like a knife over the level plains and into t he face.
Charles’s soldiers suffered in silent fortitude while two thousand of
them died of hunger or cold. “You could see,” said an eyewitness, “some
without hands, some without feet, some without ears or noses, many
creeping along after the manner of quadrupeds.” 30 Charles bade them
march on, trusting that somewhere soon they would come upon Peter’s main
army and win all Russia with one overwhelming victory. Wherever he made
contact with the enemy, at</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl) THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC 387</p>
<p>Holowczyn, Cerkova, and Opressa, he won through superior generalship
and courage, often against forces ten times greater than his own. But
when that winter ended, his army had dwindled from 44,000 to 24,000
men.</p>
<p>On May it, 1709, it reached Poltava, on a tributary of the
Dnieper,</p>
<p>eighty- five miles southwest of Kharkov. Here at last Charles sighted
Peter’s</p>
<p>The battle had endless and far-reaching results. Leszczynski fled
to</p>
<p>Alsace, and Augustus II remounted the Polish throne. Russia
appropriated the Baltic principalities and all of the Ukraine. Denmark
rejoined the alli- ance against Sweden, invaded Skane, but was repulsed.
Frederick William of Prussia took Stettin and Holstein, and part of
Pomerania. Russian prestige and pride ran high; Louis XIV offered his
alliance to Peter, who rejected it but consented to receive an
envoy.</p>
<p>Charles did not admit that he was definitely beaten. The Turks,
grate- ful to anyone who had made trouble for Russia, gave their royal
refugee all but royal honors. At Bender (now Tighina), near the
Dniester, he main- tained his own court, and received from Sultan Ahmed
III supplies for himself and eighteen hundred Swedes still in his
service. As soon as his foot healed he resumed martial exercises, and
drilled his little army. His abstinence from wine, and his regular
attendance at public prayers, led to</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>the report that he was a convert to Islam. He employed every means to
persuade the Sultan or the vizier to make war against Russia; and in
that hope he refused to be taken back to Sweden by French vessels
offered to his use. An attempt was made to poison him, but it was
detected in time. Peter demanded that Mazeppa be surrendered to him as a
traitorous Russian subject; Charles would not permit it, and Mazeppa cut
the knot by dying (1710).</p>
<p>Every victory breeds new enemies or inflames old ones. Charles was
able to convince the Sultan that the rising power of Russia, now
unchecked in the north, would sooner or later challenge Turkish control
of the Black Sea and the Bosporus. The Sultan declared war, and sent
against Russia</p>
<p>200.000 men under his vizier. Peter, caught by surprise, could gather
only</p>
<p>38.000 soldiers in the south to stop this avalanche. His Bulgarian
and Serbian allies failed him. When the two armies met at the River Prut
(now the eastern boundary of Romania), Peter had to give battle, for the
sur- rounding country had been ravaged, and he had provisions for only
two days. Expecting defeat and death, he sent instructions to Moscow for
the election of a new czar in case his fears should be realized; then he
retired to his tent and forbade anyone to enter. But his second wife,
Catherine, agreed with his generals that surrender was better than mass
suicide. She braved Peter’s wrath by taking in to him for his signature
a letter asking the vizier for terms. Peter signed without hope.
Catherine collected all her jewels, borrowed money from the officers,
and sent Vice-Chancellor Peter Shafirov, armed with 230,000 rubles, to
negotiate terms with the vizier. The vizier took the rubles and jewels,
and allowed Peter to withdraw his army and equipment unhindered, on his
promise to surrender Azov, to dismantle the Russian forts and ships
there, to allow Charles clear passage to Sweden, and to interfere no
more in Polish affairs. Peter readily made these promises (August 1,
1711), and led his troops away. Charles, coming up ready for battle,
raged when he found peace. He secured the dismissal of the pacific
vizier and continued his efforts for war; but Shafirov, with 84,900
ducats, persuaded the new vizier to confirm the Treaty of the Prut.
Tired of these complications, the Sultan asked Charles to leave Turkey.
He refused. A Turkish force of twelve thousand men was sent to compel
him; with forty men he held them off for eight hours, killing ten Turks
himself; finally a dozen Janissaries overpowered him (February 1, 1713).
He was transported to Dimotika, near Adrianople, but was allowed to re-
main there for twenty months while a new vizier meditated war with
Russia. When this hope faded, Charles consented to return to Sweden. He
was provided with military escort, gifts, and funds. He left
Dimotika</p>
<p>(September 20, 1714), traveled through Wallachia, Transylvania, and
Austria, and at midnight, November 11, reached Pomerania and its
port</p>

<p>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BALTIC</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>and fort, Stralsund, on the Baltic coast due south of Sweden. This
and Wismar, to the west, were the last Swedish strongholds on the
mainland.</p>
<p>By this time Charles’s insistence upon governing Sweden from Turkey,
and his refusal to make any concessions to Peter, had brought the
Swedish empire to collapse. On August 1, 1714, Elector George of Hanover
had become King George I of England. Resolved to use his new power to
add Bremen and Verden to Hanover, he joined Britain with Denmark and
Prussia in a new coalition against Sweden, and the British fleet
reinforced the Danish in the Straits. Charles found himself locked up in
Stralsund, at war with England, Hanover, Denmark, Saxony, Prussia, and
Russia. For twelve months he stood siege there by 36,000 men, frequently
leading his garrison on heroic futile sallies. After the town and its
walls had been shattered by the besiegers’ cannon, and surrender was
inevitable, Charles leaped into a small vessel, sailed through enemy
fire, and reached Karlskrona on the Swedish coast (December 12,
1715).</p>
<p>Stockholm awaited him as its desperate hero, but he refused to return
there except as a victor. He ordered new levies of men, even of youths
fifteen years old; he conscripted all articles of iron to build another
fleet; and taxed almost every article used by his people, even to their
wigs. They obeyed silently, thinking him perhaps mad, but glorious.
Baron Georg von Gortz, now his chief minister, labored to break up the
coalition. Noting that George I was quarreling with Peter over the
division of the spoils, he tried to make peace between Sweden and
Russia, and aid the Stuart revolt in England; but his plans failed. By
the fall of 1717 Charles had assembled an army of twenty thousand men.
That year, and again in 1718, he in- vaded Norway, hoping to win
territory that might compensate for his mainland losses. In December he
laid siege to the fortress of Fredrikssten. On the twelfth he raised his
head for a moment over the parapet of the foremost trench. A Norwegian
bullet struck him in the right temple and killed him instantly. He was
thirty-six years old.</p>
<p>He died as he had lived, stupefied with bravery. He was a great
general, and won unbelievable victories against great odds; but he loved
war to intoxication, never had victories enough, and, in search of them,
planned campaigns to the verge of insanity. His generosity was spoiled
by his pride; he gave much, but demanded more; and time and again he
prevented peace by refusing concessions that might have saved his empire
and his face. Hist ory pardons him because it was not he who had begun
this “Great Northern War” that he refused to finish except with
victory.</p>
<p>The Swedish government, seldom extreme, hastened negotiations for
peace. By the Treaties of Stockholm (November 20, 1719, and February
1,</p>

war, and devastated her coastal lands and cities. Finally, by the Treaty

victorious, and had made her a “Great Power.”</p>
<p>The weary, aging, but triumphant Czar, arriving at Petersburg with
the news and cry of 11 Mir! Mir!” (Peace! Peace!), was hailed by his
people as Father of his Country, Emperor of All the Russias, and Peter
the Great.</p>
