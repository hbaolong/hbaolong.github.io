<h4 id="chapter-xxiv-pitt-nelson-and-napoleon">CHAPTER XXIV Pitt,
Nelson, and Napoleon</h4>
<p>1789 — 1812</p>
<p>I. PITT AND THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>W ILLIAM Pitt II had taken office in 1783 as chancellor of the
ex-</p>
<p>chequer and first lord of the treasury. He who gathered and dis-</p>
<p>pensed the money of the realm was to be lord of the isles and the
Maecenas of coalitions.</p>
<p>He had enjoyed almost every advantage available to a Briton. He came
of a prominent family, and absorbed world politics, high finance, and
good manners from the conversation and entourage of his brilliant
father, the Earl of Chatham. He had the best private education, much of
it directly from that father himself. He entered Parliament at
twenty-one, and took charge of England at twenty-four. He overwhelmed
opposition by his</p>
<p>E roud reserve, his intellectual equipment, the logic, rather than
passion, of is oratory, the firmness and penetration of his eye, his
knowledge and ma- nipulation of public finance. He had read and admired
Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations; he accepted Smith’s philosophy of free
enterprise and free trade. He, the aristocrat, supported the claim of
the rising mercantile and industrial bourgeoisie to fuller
representation in Parliament and policy; with their fluid wealth he
fought Napoleon, while the aristocracy, with their wealth in immobile
land, contributed counsel, diplomacy, and proto- col. He established a
sinking fund for paying the national debt, and suc- ceeded in reducing
that debt until war took every shilling that could be drawn from the
nation. He tried manfully but in vain to eliminate “rotten boroughs,”
though he had used them in his rise. He supported a measure that
transferred from the judge to the popular jury the decision in cases of
alleged libel — i.e., he protected the press in its exposure of official
miscon- duct. He supported Wilberforce in the long campaign against the
trade in slaves. Napoleon defeated him and broke his spirit, but it was
the Britain that he had reorganized, financed, and inspired that
defeated Napoleon. The British King was almost as much of a problem as
the French Consul. George III followed Pitt’s advice in almost
everything but the emancipation of the Catholics; but the aging monarch
was at any moment liable to relapse into insanity — as he did in
1788-89; and when such breakdowns came, the Prince of Wales always
hovered near the throne — the Prince who was the idol of the Whigs and
the friend of Charles James Fox, who agreed with Pitt only in loving
wine this side of paralysis. For a while George III was</p>
<p>512</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON 5 1 3</p>
<p>relied upon to die (1787); he recovered, but remained weak and
hesitant; and generally thereafter submitted, wondering, to Pitt’s
rule.</p>
<p>When the young statesman took the reins England was just beginning to
recover from the disastrous war with her American colonies. Britain
seemed militarily ruined in face of a France bankrupt but victorious, a
Spain pros- pering and enlightened under Charles III, and a Russia
swelling its borders under Catherine II, organizing vast armies,
swallowing half of Poland, and plotting to divide European Turkey
between herself and Joseph II of Aus- tria. Now the safety of England
depended on two conditions: her control of the seas, and the balance of
political power in Continental Europe. If either end of that balance
became supreme, it could dictate to England, sim- ply by closing
Continental markets to British goods. The death of Joseph II (1790)
eased the Eastern threat; Catherine hesitated; and Pitt was about to
turn from foreign to domestic affairs when the French Revolution an-
nounced that it had come to give a constitution to monarchies, or
destroy them. Day by day the astonishing news crossed the Channel: the
Bastille had been stormed by a city mob; feudal rights had been
surrendered; church property had been confiscated by an impious state; a
horde of women had marched on Versailles, and had forced Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette to come and live in Paris under popular
surveillance.</p>
<p>At first Pitt was not as disturbed as his upper-class friends. After
all, England already had a constitution, which any number of famous
French- men had praised and envied. A little turmoil in France would be
appreci- ated: England could then work in peace on her internal problems
while France disordered and then reconstituted its political life. 1
While aristocrats trembled, British men of letters rejoiced — Godwin,
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Cowper, Burns. On November 4, 1789, a
“Society for Commemo - rating the Revolution” (of 1688), was so stirred
by a Unitarian preacher,</p>
<p>Be encouraged, all ye friends to freedom, and writers in its defence!
The times are auspicious. Your labours have not been in vain. Behold
kingdoms, ad- monished by you, starting from sleep, breaking their
fetters, and claiming jus- tice from their oppressors! Behold the light
you have struck out — after setting America free — reflected to France,
and there kindled into a blaze that lays despotism in ashes, and warms
and illuminates Europe!</p>
<p>Tremble, all ye oppressors of the world! Take warning, all ye
supporters of slavish governments and slavish hierarchies!… You can not
now hold the world in darkness…. Restore to mankind their rights, and
consent to the correction of abuses, before they and you are destroyed
together. 3</p>
<p>This was more than Edmund Burke could stomach. He was no longer the
fiery orator who had pleaded the cause of the American colonies before
Par-</p>
<p>5 1 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>liament; he was sixty now, he had mortgaged himself to a large
estate, and had regained the religion of his youth. On February 9, 1790,
in the House of Commons, he began a debate which ended his old
friendship with Charles James Fox:</p>
<p>Our present danger is… from anarchy: a danger of being led, through
an admiration of successful fraud and violence, to an imitation of the
excess of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscatory,
plundering, ferocious, bloody, and tyrannical democracy. On the side of
religion the danger is no longer from intolerance but from atheism — a
foul, unnatural vice, a foe to all the dignity and consolation of
mankind — which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied
into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed. 4</p>
<p>In November, 1790, Burke issued his Reflections on the French Revolu-
tion. He gave them the form of a letter to “a gentleman in Paris”— a
letter 365 pages long. He denounced Dr. Price and the Society for
Commemorat- ing the Revolution: clergymen, he felt, should mind their
business, which is to preach Christian virtues, not political reforms;
the virtues reach to the heart of the matter, which is the evil
tendencies of human nature; the re- forms change only the surface forms
of evil, for they effect no change in the nature of man. Universal
suffrage is a fraud using a delusion; a count of noses will not affect
the distribution and decisions of power. Social order is indispensable
to individual security, but it cannot survive if every indi- vidual is
free to violate any law that he does not like. An aristocracy is de-
sirable, for it allows a nation to be ruled by trained and selected
minds. Monarchy is good because it gives a psychological unity and
historical con- tinuity helpful in the difficult reconciliation of order
with liberty.</p>
<p>Two months after this historic blast Burke published a Letter to a
Mem- ber of the National Assembly of France. In this — and more fully in
a Letter to a Noble Lord (1796) — he offered a philosophical basis for
conservatism. No individual, however brilliant and well informed, can in
one lifetime ac- quire the knowledge and wisdom that would warrant him
to sit in judgment upon those complex, subtle, and persisting traditions
that embody the experi- ence and judgment of the community, the nation,
or the race after thousands of experiments in the great laboratory
called history. Gvilization would be impossible “if the practice of all
moral duties, and the foundations of society,</p>
<p>E ower of primitive instincts, will he appreciate the services of
religion in elping society to co ntrol the innate individualism of men.
“If we should uncover our nakedness [release our instincts] by throwing
off the Christian religion, which has been… one great source of
civilization amongst us,… we are apprehensive… that some uncouth,
pernicious, and degrading super- stition might take the place of it.” 6
Likewise it is difficult to explain to the</p>

<p>5*5</p>
<p>o acquire a socially useful skill, or bestir himself to practice it,
unless he is allowed to keep a portion of his earnings as a gift to his
chidren. Further- more, human society is not merely an association of
persons in space, it is also a succession of persons in time — of
persons dead, living, or unborn, in a continuity of flesh and blood
through generations. That continuity lies more deeply in us than our
association on a given spot of earth; it can per- sist through
migrations across frontiers. How can this be made clear to boys bursting
with individual ambition and sophomoric pride, and recklessly ready to
snap family ties or moral bonds?</p>
<p>Burke’s dirge for a dying world was greeted with gratitude and
delight by the conservative leaders of Britain; and men of seasoned
judgment ac- cepted the three publications as a distinguished
contribution to social and</p>
<p>E olitical philosophy. Coleridge, in his later years, enthused over
them as once e had rejoiced over the Revolution. “I cannot conceive,” he
wrote in 1820, “a time or a state of things in which the writings of
Burke will not have the</p>
<p>But Paine went much further. He demanded the replacement of mon-
archy and aristocracy by a republic; a steeply graduated income tax that
would redistribute concentrated wealth, and would use it to wipe out un-
employment and poverty, and provide education for every child, and a
pension for the old. And he restated the rights of man in terms of
Rousseau:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of
their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on
public utility.</p></li>
<li><p>The end of all political associations is the preservation of the
natural and imprescriptible rights of man; these rights are iiberty,
property, security, and resistance of oppression.</p></li>
<li><p>The Nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can
any indi- vidual, or any body of men, be entitled to any authority which
is not expressly derived from it. 8</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Rights of Man sold fifty thousand copies in a few weeks; this may
indicate the strength of the radical movement in England in 1791.
Societies more or less radical flourished: the Society for
Constitutional Information, the Corresponding Society of London, the
Scottish Friends of the People, the Society for Commemorating the
Revolution. Some of these sent com-</p>
<p>51 6 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>pliments to the French Revolution; two of them helped to give Pai
ne’s book a wide distribution.</p>
<p>Pitt observed, and was disturbed. Privately he was impressed by
Paine’s book: “Paine is no fool,” he said to his niece; “he is perhaps
right; but if I did what he wants I should have thousands of bandits on
my hands tomor- row, and London burned.” 9 He issued an order for
Paine’s arrest; Paine fled to France; he was tried in absence, and was
declared guilty of treason (De- cember, 1792).</p>
<p>The English had many reasons for not following France into
revolution. They had had their 1789 in 1642. They had had their
intellectual revolt be- fore the French: the deist erosion of orthodox
belief had preceded the French Enlightenment, and had been absorbed into
British equanimity by the time Voltaire reached England in 1726. The
Methodist movement di- verted some discontent into piety. The Anglican
Church was comparatively liberal, and had not acquired enough wealth to
arouse the envy and hos- tility of the laity. Feudalism had disappeared;
there were no feudal dues; a large proportion of the peasantry owned the
land that it tilled. The middle class had already entered Parliament,
and found effective voice in national policy; the Prime Minister often
supported its claims. The workers were badly treated by employers and
legislators, and some rebelled violently, but the Army could be depended
upon to suppress them, and the judiciary to hang their leaders. When
England and France went to war, patriotism di- verted class hatred into
nationalist fervor. Revolution subsided into reform, and spread itself
out through the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the French Revolution had passed from legislation to the
September Massacres; its army had defeated the Prussians and the
Austrians at Valmy (September 20, 1792); and the revolutionary fever had
spread into Rhineland Germany. The citizens of Mainz and Darmstadt,
having thrown off feudal rule and set up a popular government, and
fearing in- vasion and punishment by monarchical troops, had sent
emissaries to France, asking protection. After some debate the French
government issued (No- vember 19, 1792) the most revolutionary of all
its decrees:</p>
<p>The National Convention declares, in the name of the French Nation,
that it will accord fraternity and aid to all peoples who wish to
recover their liberty, and charges the executive power to give the
generals the orders necessary for bringing aid to these peoples, and to
defend the citizens who shall have been, or may be, troubled for the
cause of freedom. 10</p>
<p>This recklessly generous announcement set every European monarchy on
edge. The government of Great Britain was further alarmed by the advance
of French troops into Belgium, and the demands of France upon Holland
for the opening of the River Scheldt to all trade. This navigable river,
270 miles long, rises in eastern France, and wanders through Belgium
(passing close to Antwerp) into Holland, where it divides into two
estuaries and empties into the North Sea. Holland, by permission of the
Peace of West- phalia (1648), had closed both estuaries to all trade
except of its own choice, which favored Britain and excluded Belgium; so
Antwerp declined and Am-</p>

<p>5*7</p>
<p>sterdam flourished. On November 27, 1792, the French government
notified England of its resolve to force open the outlets of the
Scheldt. Pitt replied that Britain was bound, by a treaty of 1788, to
protect Holland from any foreign attack. Furthermore, since the Rhine
also emptied into the North Sea through Dutch estuaries, the control of
Holland by France would mean French control of the mouths of the Rhine,
and therefore of British trade reaching central Germany by the Rhine. On
December 31, 1792, the British government notified France that</p>
<p>England will never consent that France should arrogate the power of
annulling at ner pleasure — and under the pretence of a pretended
natural right of which she makes herself the only judge — the political
system of Europe, established by solemn treaties and guaranteed by the
consent of all the Powers. This govern- ment, adhering to tne maxims
which it has followed for more than a century, will also never see with
indifference that France shall make itself, either di- rectly or
indirectly, the sovereign of the Low Countries, or general arbiter of
the rights and liberties of Europe. 11</p>
<p>January 21, 1793, the French government beheaded Louis XVI. News of
this reached London on the 23 rd, shocking George III, and, soon
thereafter, most of the British people. On January 24 the British
government ordered the French minister, Marquis Fran§ois-Bemard de
Chauvelin, to leave the On February 1 France declared war on both
England and Hol-</p>
<p>George III welcomed the war, believing that it would unify the
nation. Pitt regretted it, but gave it all his energies. He opened
negotiations that led to the First Coalition (1793): Britain, Portugal,
Spain, Sardinia, Naples, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. He levied high
taxes upon every class and group in the kingdom, and sent repeated
subsidies to his allies. He tightened the laws against any propaganda
defending France or the Revolution. He sus- pended the freedom of the
press, and (1794) the Habeas Corpus Act, which had secured the right of
every arrested person to early trial or speedy re- lease; political
suspects could now be held without trial. (France did the same.) After
an antiwar demonstration in which a stone was thrown at the King, the
Seditious Meetings Act (1796) forbade meetings of over fifty people
except under governmental license and control. Critics of the British
Constitution were liable to seve n years’ exile in Australia’s Botany
Bay. Prominent radicals — John Horne Tooke, philologist, John Thelwall,
friend of the early Coleridge, and shoemaker Thomas Hardy, founder of
the Lon- don Corresponding Society — were tried on charges of treason
(May, 1794), were defended by Thomas Erskine, and were acquitted.</p>
<p>These trials revealed the panic that had struck the upper classes of
Britain when they found themselves faced by another revolution so soon
after the costly revolt of the American colonies. The thousand-year-old
world of kings and aristocracies seemed to be collapsing, besieged by
peasants burn- ing feudal chateaux and title deeds, and by city mobs
imprisoning the royal family and cutting off hundreds of noble heads.
All this, many Britons felt, was the result of atheistic French
“philosophers,” and of their English imita -</p>

<p>ions, Godwin and Paine. Any time now the godless French troops would
take Holland and the Rhineland; in a year or two they might try to
invade England. How could Britain, with only 15 million men and no
standing army, defeat in war a France with 28 million men and an army
already proud with victory?</p>
<p>Pitt knew all this, but he thought in terms of money rather than of
men; men could be bought for money, if not in England, then in Austria,
Prussia, Russia; and England had money, coming in every day from
commerce, in- dustry, land, colonies, loans, taxes on every article of
consumption, on every form of income. These revenues could equip a small
army for defense against an improbable invasion; they could keep
Britain’s factories humming, her press patriotic and her caricaturists
at the top of their form; they could pay for new armies provided by
allies short or money and long of men. Above all, they could build and
man ships numerous enough, armed enough, to control the oceans, blockade
every French port, capture any French vessel at sea, annex to the
British Empire any French colony. Every month that Navy was growing in
sturdy ships and disciplined, incomparable sea- men. And it had one of
the greatest admirals in history.</p>

<p>The Nelsons were originally Nielsens, of East Anglian Viking
stock;</p>
<p>perhaps Horatio had ships in his blood. He was born September 29,
1758, in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, which neighbors the sea. His father
was rec- tor of the parish. His mother was related to Robert Walpole,
prime minister. Her brother, Captain Maurice Suckling, was assigned in
1770 to H.M.S. Raisonnable in expectation of war with Spain. Horatio,
aged twelve, begged and received permission to serve under him;
thereafter the boy’s school was the sea.</p>
<p>He was not physically strong; he was often sick; but he was resolved
to seize every opportunity for instruction, development, and honor. He
served in various vessels on a variety of missions, repeatedly risking
his life; was promoted step by step, and at twenty was made captain of
the frigate Hinchinbrook. He was as vain as he was competent, and never
doubted that he would someday reach the top in post and fame. He was as
tardy in obey- ing his superiors as they were in rewarding his services;
but he gave an arm, then an eye, then his life for Britain, and could be
indulged in a pride as lofty as his monument.</p>
<p>Sensitive to every sight and touch, he readily surrendered to the
beauty, grace, and tenderness of women. At Quebec in 1782, as captain of
the Albe- marle, he was on the verge of leaving his post at the cost of
his career, to return to the city with an offer of marriage to a woman
who had given him her warmth the night before; a resolute friend barred
his way and called him back to his duty and destiny. 12 In 1787, as
captain of the cruiser Boreas, he dallied at Antigua, in the West
Indies, and married Mrs. Frances Nisbet, a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON 519</p>
<p>pretty young widow with a rich uncle. He brought her to England, set
her up on a small but comfortable estate, and spent a happy interbellum
with her in the country. When war with France became likely he was made
cap- tain (1793) of the Agamevmon — one of the most highly rated ships
in the Navy — with instructions to join Lord Hood’s fleet in the
Mediterranean,</p>
<p>Amy Lyon, born in 1761 to a Welsh blacksmith, had in youth earned her
bread with her body, and had borne two illegitimate children by the time
she was nineteen. In that year she settled down as the mistress of the
Hon- orable Charles Greville, second son of the Earl of Warwick. He
rechris- tened her Emma Hart, taught her the arts of ladyship — singing,
dancing, harpsichord, entering a room gracefully, exchanging nougats of
conversa- tion, and pouring tea. When he had refashioned everything but
her soul, he took her to George Romney, who painted thirty portraits of
her. When Greville found a chance to marry an heiress, he had to find
another berth for his fair lady, who had now learned to love him.
Luckily his uncle Sir William Hamilton, a childless widower, was then in
England. He was rich, a foster brother of George III, a fellow of the
Royal Society, a distinguished collector of Herculanea and classic art.
He found Emma to his liking, and agreed to take her off his nephew’s
hands. After retur ning to Naples, he sent Emma an invitation to come to
Naples with her mother and there com- plete her education in music. She
accepted, on the understanding that Charles Greville would soon follow
her. He did not come.</p>
<p>Sir William gave her and her mother four rooms in the British
Legation. He comforted her with luxuries and tactful admiration; he
arranged for her instruction in music and Italian; he paid her milliners
without complaint. She wrote fond letters to Grevi lle, begging him to
come; he bade her “oblige Sir William”; his letters became rarer,
shorter, and ceased. She became Sir William’s mistress, for she relished
love only next to luxury. Otherwise she behaved modestly and discreetly,
spread charity, became a favorite with the nuns, the King, and the
Queen. She sat for her portrait to Raphael Mengs, Angelica Kauffmann,
Mme. Vigee-Lebrun. Pleased with her, Sir William made her his wife
(1791). When France declared war on England she be- came an active and
passionate patriot, and labored to keep Naples in the coalition with
England.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1794 Nelson was ordered to lay siege to Calvi, a
seaport of Corsica, then held by the French. He captured the stronghold,
but during the battle an enemy shot, striking near him, spattered sand
into his right eye. The wound healed without disfigurement, but the eye
was left permanently blind.</p>
<p>That victory meant little in the perspective of events, for their
course in the next two years was strongly against England. Napoleon
entered Italy, scattered the Sardinian and Austrian armies, and
compelled the governments of Sardinia, Austria, and Naples to leave the
First Coalition and accept terms of peace with France. In October, 1796,
Spain, angered by British actions in</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>he West Indies, declared war against England. With the Spanish fleet
ready to join the French in the Mediterranean, that sea became unsafe
for the British. On February 14, 1797, a British force of fifteen ships
under Admiral Sir John Jervis, then commander of the Mediterranean
fleet, came upon a Spanish armada of twenty-seven vessels some thirty
miles out from Cape St. Vincent, the extreme southwest coast of
Portugal. Nelson, commanding H.M.S. Captain, directed this and other
vessels to attack the rear guard of the enemy flotilla, and himself led
his men in boarding and capturing the San Josef and then the San
Nicolas. The Spanish ships, poorly armed and poorly managed, with
untrained men at the guns, surrendered, one after an- other, giving the
English so complete a victory that Jervis was made Earl of St. Vincent,
and Nelson was made a knight of the Bath. The British Navy was again
master of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In July, 1797, Nelson — now a rear admiral — was sent to capture
Santa Cruz, on one of the Canary Islands. The town had been strongly
fortified by the Spanish as strategically vital for protection of their
trade with the Americas. It offered an unexpectedly able resistance,
helped by a rough surf that made the British landing boats almost
unmanageable; some were smashed on rocks, some were disabled by Spanish
guns; the attack failed. Nelson himself was shot in the right elbow; the
arm was incompetently am- putated, and Nelson was sent home to
recuperate under the care of his wife.</p>
<p>He fretted at the thought that the Admiralty would list him — with
only one arm and one eye — as permanently disabled. He begged for a new
com- mission. In April, 1798, he was assigned as rear admiral to H.M.S.
Van- guard, with orders to join Lord St. Vincent’s fleet near Gibraltar.
On May 2 he was given command of three ships of the line and five
frigates, with in- structions to watch outside Toulon, where Napoleon
was preparing a mys- terious expedition under the shelter of the
harbor’s forts. On May 20 Nel - son’s squadron was so badly damaged by a
storm that it had to retire to Gibraltar for repairs. When the ships
returned to their watch Nelson learned that the French flotilla, under
cover of darkness, had left Toulon and sailed east, destination unknown.
He set sail in pursuit, spent much time following false clues, ran out
of supplies, and put in at Palermo to provision and re- condition his
fleet. This was allowed him through the intercession of Lady Hamilton
with the Neapolitan government, which, being then at peace with France,
had hesitated to allow this violation of its neutrality.</p>
<p>His ships again in good order, Nelson led them back to the search for
Napoleon’s fleet. He found it at last at Abukir, near Alexandria. Now
again he risked everything. On the night of July 31, 1798, he bade his
officers put all their ships in readiness for battle at dawn. “By this
time tomorrow,” he said, “I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster
Abbey”— a hero’s tomb. 13 In the battle he exposed himself as usual. A
fragment of shot struck him in the forehead; he was taken below deck in
expectation of death, but the wound proved superficial, and soon Nelson,
head bandaged, was back on deck, and remained there till the British
victory was complete.</p>
<p>With the dangerous “Little Corporal” apparently bottled up, Pitt
was</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>5 21</p>
<p>able to form a Second Coalition with Russia, Turkey, Austria,
Portugal, and Naples. The Neapolitan Queen Maria Carolina, sister of the
guillotined Marie Antoinette, happy to see her chaotic kingdom once more
engaged on the side of the Hapsburg dynasty and the Catholic Church,
joined with her lackadaisical King Ferdinand IV in preparing a royal
welcome for Nelson’s victorious but damaged fleet, which anchored in
Naples’ harbor on Septem - ber 22, 1798. Lady Hamilton, seeing the
wounded admiral, rushed forward to greet him, and fainted in his arms.
14 She and her husband took him into their legation, the Palazzo Sassa,
and did everything for his comfort. Emma made no effort to conceal her
infatuation, and the famished hero warmed to her under her smiles and
care. He was forty, she was thirty-seven; she was no longer ravishing,
but she was near and fed the Briton with the adulation which had become
to him, next to battle, the wine of life. Sir William, now fifty-eight,
running short of funds and absorbed in art and politics, accepted the
situation philosophically, and may have felt relieved. By the spring of
1799 Nelson was paying a large part of Emma’s expenses. The British Admi
- ralty, after voting him the highest honors and substantial sums, and
allowing him due rest, bade him go to the aid of other admirals; he
excused himself on the ground that it was more important for him to stay
and protect Naples from the spreading revolution.</p>
<p>Late in 1799 Hamilton was replaced by Arthur Paget as British
minister at Naples. On April 24, 1800, Sir William and Emma left Naples
for Leg- horn, where they were joined by Nelson; thence they traveled
overland to the Channel, and across the Channel to England. All London
feted him, but public opinion condemned his continued attachment to
another man’s wife. Mrs. Nelson came to reclaim her husband, and
demanded that he divest him- self of Emma; when he refused, she left
him. On January 30, 1801, Emma, at Sir William’s estate, gave birth to a
daughter, whom she named Horatia</p>

</ol>
<p>When Pitt resigned his first ministry (February 3, 1801) he readily
sup- ported the appointment of his friend Henry Addington as his
successor. Addington snared Pitt’s dislike of the war. He noted its
unpopularity with the country, especially with exporters; he saw how
readily Austria had dis- solved the Second Coalition after her defeat at
Marengo; he saw no sense in wasting subsidies on such weak-kneed allies;
he resolved to end the war as</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>soon as face-saving would permit. On March 27, 1802, his agents
signed with Napoleon the Peace of Amiens. For fourteen months the guns
were silent; but Napoleon’s expansion of his power in Italy and
Switzerland, and England’s refusal to leave Malta, ended this lucid
interval, and hostilities were</p>
<p>He set himself at once to form a Third Coalition (1805), with Russia,
Austria, and Sweden, and gave them subsidies raised in part by an
increase of twenty-five percent in taxes. Napoleon responded by ordering
his Chan- nel army to march across France and give Austria another
lesson; and to his vice-admiral, Pierre de Villeneuve, he sent
instructions to prepare the best ships of the French Navy to meet Nelson
in a fight to end British control of the seas.</p>
<p>Nelson’s flagship, the Victory, had 703 men, averaging twenty-two
years old; some were twelve or thirteen, a few were ten. About half of
them had been captured by press gangs; many were convicts condemned to
naval serv- ice as a penalty for crime. Their pay was minimal, but they
shared, accord- ing to their station and behavior, in the cash realized
from captured vessels or stores. Shore leave was rare, through fear of
desertions; to meet the needs of the men, cargoes of prostitutes were
brought on board; at Brest, one morning 309 women were afloat, with 307
men. 15 The conscripts soon learned, through hard discipline, to adjust
themselves to their condition, and usually to take pride in their work
and their courage. Nelson, we are told, was popular with his men because
he never punished except through obvi- ous necessity and with visible
regret; because he knew a seaman’s business, and seldom erred in tactics
or command; because he himself faced the guns of the enemy; and because
he made his men believe that they would never fail him or E ngland, and
would never be defeated. This was the “Nelson touch” that made these
condemned men love him. 16</p>
<p>On July 8, 1803, he joined his eleven ships in the Mediterranean off
Tou- lon, in whose spacious harbor Villeneuve and his fleet were finding
protec- tion by the guns of the forts. The French admiral had lately
received new orders from Napoleon: to escape from Toulon, force a
passage by Gibraltar, sail to the West Indies, join another French
squadron there and attack Brit- ish forces wherever encountered. While
Nelson’s ships were taking on water</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON 523</p>
<p>ic, and effected union, at Corunna, with a Spanish squadron of
fourteen vessels under Admiral Federico de Gravina.</p>
<p>Revised orders from Napoleon bade him sail north, join another French
force at Brest, and attempt to wrest control of the Channel before
Nelson could come up from the West Indies. But Villeneuve’s ships, after
their Caribbean cruise, were in no condition to face battle. On August 1
3 he led his enlarged fleet in a dash south to the well-equipped and
well-fortifled har- bor of Cadiz, and began there the reconditioning of
his ships and men. Late in August a British squadron under Vice-Admiral
Cuthbert Collingwood took up the task of keeping watch on Villeneuve.
Nelson, after completing his comedy of crossings, thought that he too,
and his men, needed repairs and rest, and he was allowed some weeks with
his mistress at Merton. On September 28 he and his ships joined
Collingwood off Cadiz, and waited impatiently for the French to come out
and fight.</p>
<p>Napoleon again changed his instructions: Villeneuve was to leave
Cadiz, try to elude the British fleet, and go to cooperate with Joseph
Bonaparte in the French control of Naples. On October 19 and 20 the
reluctant admiral led his thirty-three ships out of Cadiz and headed for
Gibraltar. On the 20th Nelson sighted them, and at once ordered his
twenty-seven vessels to clear their decks for battle. That night he
began, and the next morning finished, a letter to Lady Hamilton:</p>
<p>My Dearest beloved Emma, the dear friend of my bosom the signal has
been made that the Enemy’s combined fleet are coming out of port. We
have very little wind so that I have no hopes of seeing them before
tomorrow. May the God of Battles crown my endeavours with success at all
events I will take care that my name shall ever be most dear to you and
Horatia both of whom I love as much as my own life…. May God Almighty
give us success over these fellows and enable us to get peace. 17</p>
<p>And in his diary, on the day of battle, he wrote:</p>
<p>… May the Great God… grant to my country, and for the benefit of
Europe in general, a great and glorious Victory, and may no misconduct
in any one tarnish it; and may humanity after victory be the predominant
fea- ture in the British fleet. For myself,… I commit my life to Him who
made me; and may his blessing light upon my endeavours for serving my
Country faithfully. To him I assign myself and the just cause which is
entrusted to me to defend. Amen. Amen. Amen. 18</p>
<p>The rival armadas met on October 21, 1805, off Cape Trafalgar, on the
coast of Spain shortly south of Cadiz. Villeneuve, from his flagship
Bucen- taure, signaled to his ships to form in a single line from north
to south, their port sides to the oncoming enemy; the vessels,
imperfectly handled, had barely completed this maneuver when they found
themselves the target of the British forces advancing northeastward in a
double line. At 11:35 a.m. Nelson, from his flagship Victory, sent
flashing throughout his fleet the famous signal “England expects that
every man will do his duty.” At 11:50 Admiral Collingwood, commanding
fifteen ships, led the attack by ordering his flagship, the Royal
Sovereign, to sail directly through the gap between</p>
<p>52 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>he first and second of Admiral Grav ina’s men -of-war, the Santa Ana
and the Fougueux. By this move his men were in a position to fire
broadsides against both the Spanish vessels, which could not return the
fire — battleships were then designed with few or no guns fore or aft.
The British gunners had an additional advantage: they could ignite their
cannon with flintlocks (pistol locks having a flint in the cock to
strike a spark) ; this method was twice as quick as the French way of
igniting cannon by slow-acting</p>
<p>matches; and the firing could be better synchronized with the roll of
the ship. 19 The remainder of Collingwood’s squadron followed his
example by piercing the enemy’s line, then veering, and concentrating
their attack upon Gravina’s ships, where moral e was low. At the
northern end of the battle line the French met bravely the fury of
Nelson’s attack; some of them cried, “ Vive TEmpereur /” as they died;
nevertheless, as at Abukir, the superior training and skill of the
British crews, in seamanship and gunnery, carried the day.</p>
<p>But the issue was decided when a sniper in the topmast of the
Redoutable directed a fatal shot at Nelson. The admiral had not only
exposed himself as usual; he had doubled his peril by refusing to remove
from his chest the distinguishing badges of honor that England had
conferred upon him. The ball went through his breast and shattered his
spine. His devoted aide, Cap- tain Thomas Masterman Hardy, carried him
down into the hold, where Dr. Beatty confirmed Nelson’s convi ction that
he had only a few hours of life left to him. He remained conscious
another four hours, long enough to learn that his fleet had won a
complete victory, that nineteen of the enemy’s ships had surrendered,
not one of the British. Almost his last words were, “Take care of my
dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy; take care of poor Lady</p>
<p>Hamilton.” Then, “Kiss me, Hardy. Now I am satisfied. Thank God,
I</p>
<p>have done my duty.” 20</p>
<p>All of Nelson’s ships, anchored by Nelson’s deathbed command,
survived the gale that he had foreseen, and reached England in time to
let their crews share in the national celebration of their victory. The
hero’s corpse, im - mersed in brandy to delay decomposition, was carried
upright in a cask to England, where it received the most splendid
funeral in living memory. Captain Hardy delivered to Lady Hamilton her
dead lover’s farewell letter. She treasured it as her only consolation.
At the end of it she wrote:</p>
<p>Oh miserable wretched Emma,</p>
<p>Oh glorious and happy Nelson.</p>
<p>His will left all his property and governmental rewards to his wife
except for the house at Merton, which Emma Hamilton retained. Worried
lest this — and her annuity from her husband — should not keep her in
comfort, he wrote a c odicil to his will on the day of battle: “I leave
Emma Lady Hamilton as a legacy to my King and Country, that they will
give her an ample pro- vision to maintain her rank in life”; and in his
dying hours, as reported by Dr. Scott, he asked that his coun try should
take care also of “my daughter Horatia.” 21 King and country ignored
these requests. Emma was arrested for</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON 525</p>
<p>debt in 1813, and soon released, and fled to France to escape her
creditors. She died in poverty at Calais, January 20, 1815.</p>
<p>Admiral Gravina, after an honorable resistance, escaped with his
flag- ship to Spain, but so severely wounded that he died a few months
later. Villeneuve had not led wisely but had fought bravely, exposing
himself as recklessly as Nelson; he surrendered his ship only after
nearly all his men were dead. He was taken to England, was released, and
left for France. Unwilling to face Napoleon, he killed himself in a
hotel at Rennes, April 22,</p>
<ol start="1806" type="1">
<li>His final letter apologized to his wife for deserting her, and
thanked the fates that he was leaving no child “to be burdened with my
name.” 22</li>
</ol>
<p>Trafalgar was one of the “decisive battles” of history. It decided
for a century Britain’s mastery of the seas. It ended Napoleon’s chance
to free France from the cordon that the British fleet had drawn along
her shores. It forced him to give up all thought of invading England. It
meant that he must fight land battles ever more costly, and ever leading
to more. He thought to cancel Trafalgar by his massive victory at
Austerlitz (Decem- ber 2, 1805); but this led to Jena, Eylau, Friedland,
Wagram, Borodino, Leipzig, Waterloo. Sea power would win.</p>
<p>Even so, Pitt, who had lived through a hundred crises to rejoice over
Trafalgar, agreed with Napoleon in thinking that Austerlitz had matched
and canceled Nelson’s victory. Worn out by a succession of crises in do
- mestic as well as foreign affairs, he withdrew from London for a rest
in Bath. There he received the news that Austria, the pivot of his
coalitions, had again collapsed. The shock gave the finishing touch to
physical ailments deadened and doubled by brandy. On January 9, 1806, he
was taken to his home in Putney. In that house, on January 23, 1806, he
died, aged forty- seven, after having been prime minister of Great
Britain through nearly all his adult life. In those nineteen years he
had helped to guide his country to industrial, commercial, and maritime
supremacy, and had reformed its finan- cial system masterfully; but he
had failed either to chasten and confine the French Revolution or to
check the dangerous expansion of Napoleon’s au - thority in Europe. The
Continental balance of power, so precious to Eng- land, was
disappearing, and hard-won domestic liberties of speech, assem- blage,
and press had been lost for the duration of a war that had now gone on
for twelve years, and gave no sign of an end.</p>

<p>The scope of our canvas will not allow us to describe in detail the
four ministries that succeeded Pitt’s. Barring a year of Fox, their
energies went to personal and party problems rather than to
statesmanship and policy, and their sum total, internationally, was more
of the same to the same result: the descent from prosperity to
destitution, and from enterprise into pro- crastination.</p>
<p>The brief “Ministry of All the Talents” (1806 -07) was brightened by
the</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>efforts of Charles James Fox, as secretary for foreign affairs, to
arrange peace with France. His unsteady career had been marked by a
patient liber- alism and his capacity to accept the French Revolution,
and even Napoleon, into the tolerable eccentricities of history.
Unfortunately he came to power when his strength of body and mind had
suffered from his reckless enjoy- ment of food and drink. He made a
handsome approach to negotiations by sending word to Talleyrand
(February 16, 1806) that a British patriot had come to the Foreign
Office with a plan for assassinating Napoleon, and add- ing assurances
that the zany was being carefully watched. The Emperor appreciated the
gesture, but he was so elated with his triumph over Austria, and Britain
was so exalted by Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar, that neither would make
the concessions required as preparatory to peace. Fox suc- ceeded better
with his proposal to Parliament for ending the traffic in slaves; after
a generation of effort by Wilberforce and a hundred others, the mea-
sure became law (March, 1807). By that time Fox had died (September
13,</p>
<p>1806), aged fifty-seven, and British politics fell into a treadmill
of hopeful inertia.</p>
<p>This, however, would hardly be the just word for the dominant figures
in the ministry (1807-09) of William Cavendish Bentinck, Duke of Port-
land. George Canning, secretary for foreign affairs, sent a fleet to
bombard Copenhagen (1807); and Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh,
secretary for war, sent a disastrous expedition to Walcheren in an
attempt to capture Antwerp (1809). The two secretaries, matched in
ability and passion, quar- reled over each other’s enterprises, and
fought a duel, which scratched Can - ning. Doubly tarnished by internal
comedy and external tragedy, the Portland ministry resigned.</p>
<p>Spencer Perceval, as minister (1809-12), had the double misfortune of
seeing Britain reach its nineteenth-century nadir, and of being
assassinated for ms pains. By the fall of 1810 Napoleon’s Continental
Blockade had so injured British industry and commerce that thousands of
Britons were unemployed, and millions were on the edge of destitution.
Unrest had come to revolutionary violence; the Luddite weavers began to
smash ma- chines in 18 1 1. In 1810 British exports to northern Europe
had brought in £ 7,700,000; in 18 1 1 they brought in £ 1,500, ooo. 23
In 1811 England was slipping into a second war with America; as part of
the cost her exports to the United States fell from £ 1 1,300,000 in
1810 to £ 1,870,000 in 1811. Meanwhile taxes were rising for every
Briton, until, by 1814, their burden threatened the collapse of
Britain’s financial system, and the credit of her currency abroad.
Hungry Britons cried out for a lowering of import duties on foreign
grain; agricultural Britons opposed such a move lest it reduce the price
of their product; Napoleon eased the crisis for England ( 18 10-1 1 ) by
selling export licenses to French grain producers; he needed cash for
his campaigns. When the Grand Army set out for Russia in 1812 England
knew that victory for Napoleon would mean the more rigid closing of all
Conti- nental ports against British goods, and Napoleon’s fuller control
of Conti - nental shipments to Britain. All England watched and
worried.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) PITT, NELSON, AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>5 2 7</p>
<p>Except George III. He was spared awareness of these events by his
final lapse into deafness, blindness, and insanity. The death of his
best beloved daughter Amelia (November 1810) was the last blow, snapping
all connec- tion between his mind and reality; now he was privileged to
live in a world of his own, in which there were no rebel colonies, no
ministerial Foxes, no unmannerly, murderous Napoleons. He must have
found some satisfaction in this condition, for otherwise his health
improved; he lived on for ten years more, talking cheerfully, without
bond or burden of logic or grammar, amid every comfort and service, and
through a postwar depression worse than that of 1810-12. His popularity
grew with his disease. His starving people pitied him, and wondered,
with old myths, had he not been touched and taken by God.</p>
<p>On May 1 1, 1812, in the lobby of the House of Commons, Prime Minis-
ter Perceval was shot dead by a bankrupt broker, John Bellingham, who
felt that his commercial enterprises had been ruined by the policies of
the gov- ernment. In June, under the Earl of Liverpool, a new cabinet
was formed, which, by miracles of tact and circumstance, endured till
1827. In that same June the United States declared war upon England, and
Napoleon’s 500,000 men crossed the Niemen into Russia.</p>
