<h4 id="chapter-xxiv">CHAPTER XXIV</h4>
<p>The Sun Sets</p>
<p>I. MME. DE MAINTENON</p>
<p>A FTER the death of Marie Therese (July 30, 1683), the uncrowned</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen of France was the “Widow Scarron,” the Marquise de</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintenon, governess of the King’s bastards, soon (January, 1684?)
his morganatic wife, and henceforth the strongest personal influence in
the reign.</p>
<p>It is difficult today to know her real character, and historians
still debate it. She had many enemies who resented her rise and power;
some of them wrote history, and handed her down to us as a selfish,
scheming villain. However, when she might have replaced Mme. de
Montespan as royal mistress — with all the influence that this would
bring — she refused, and, instead, persuaded the King to return to the
bed of the Queen (August,</p>
<p>1680). The Queen was then forty-two, three years younger than La</p>
<p>Maintenon, and there was no reason to expect her early death; at this
point, apparently, the Marquise preferred virtue to power. When death
took the Queen the governess still refused to become a mistress; she
played for higher stakes, risking her present place. If her virtue was
ambition, it was no more sullied by it than the modesty of a prudent
maiden who has only her charms to bargain for her life, and thinks a
night’s lodging less security than a wedding ring. When Louis married
Maintenon she was forty-eight years old; Mignard pictured her as an
amiable matron long past the age of physical allure. At best she was
sincerely pious; at worst she took a brave gamble, and won.</p>
<p>Placed now in an apartment near the King’s, she lived in the Palace
of Versailles with an almost bourgeois simplicity. “Court life was
irksome to</p>
<p>you.” 2 She asked some modest favors for her relatives, and
considerable sums for her pet enterprise, the college that in 1686 she
established at St.-Cyr for girls of good family but straitened means. It
was not her vanity, but the King’s that conscripted labor and money for
the abortive aqueduct that took her name.</p>
<p>In many ways she was a good wife. Her constant occupation,
through</p>
<p>685</p>
<p>686 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>a busy day, was to serve as a buffer between the King and the world,
to maintain peace amid the ambitions and intrigues of courtiers, to
humor a swarm of place- seekers, to serve as a kindly aunt to her
husband’s grand - children, to meet his masculine needs, to comfort him
in his failures and defeats, to amuse “the man most difficult to amuse
in all his kingdom,”® and to bring an atmosphere of domestic calm into a
life that in almost every hour had to make decisions affecting a million
lives. Among her private papers found after her death was this prayer,
apparently composed soon after her marriage:</p>
<p>Lord God, Thou hast placed me where I am, and I submit myself</p>
<p>to Thy providence without reserve. Grant me grace that as a
Chris-</p>
<p>tian I may support its sorrows, sanctify its pleasures, seek in
every-</p>
<p>thing Thy glory, and . . . help the salvation of the King. Prevent
me</p>
<p>from giving way to the agitations of a restless mind. . . . Thy will,
O</p>
<p>God, not mine, be done; for the sole happiness in this world and the
next is to submit to it without reserve. Fill me with this wisdom, and
all other spiritual gifts necessary to the high place to which Thou hast
called me; make fruitful the talents Thou hast been pleased to give</p>
<p>me. Thou who holdest in Thy hands the hearts of kings, open that of
the King that I may set therein the good that Thou desirest; enable me
to please, console, encourage, and even, if it be necessary to Thy</p>
<p>glory, to sadden him. Let me hide none of the things he might
learn</p>
<p>from me which others have not the courage to tell him. Let me save
myself together with him; 〔let me〕 love him in Thee and for Thee;</p>
<p>and let him love me in the same way. Grant that we may walk together
in Thy paths without reproach until the day of Thy coming. 4</p>
<p>This is beautiful, as beautiful as any letter of Helolse to Abelard,
and, we hope, more authentic; such a prayer can give strength regardless
of any external response. Perhaps there is a secret will to power in the
desire to reform and guide others; but Maintenon’s remaining years
proved the</p>
<p>Did she encourage the persecution of the Huguenots? Saint-Simon</p>
<p>thought so, 8 but later investigation tends to clear her of this
inhumanity, in which Louvois, her consistent enemy, was the protagonist.
Lord Acton, a Catholic historian seldom pro-Catholic, judged her</p>
<p>the most cultivated, thoughtful, and observant of women. She had</p>
<p>been a Protestant, and retained for a long time the zeal of a
convert.</p>
<p>She was strongly opposed to Jansenists, and was much in the con-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>687</p>
<p>fidence of the best men among the clergy. It was universally believed
that she promoted persecution and urged the King to revoke the Edict of
Nantes. Her letters are produced in evidence. But her letters have been
tampered with by an editor who was a forger and a falsifier . 7 #</p>
<p>Like Fenelon, Mme. de Sevigne, and nearly all Catholics at the time,
she approved the Revocation, but she usecf her influence — often
successfully, says the Protestant Michelet — to check the cruelty of the
persecution . 8</p>
<p>Lest a romantic tendency to idealize woman should color the picture
with roses, let us look at the Marquise through other prejudices. Saint-
Simon’s ducal pride could never forgive the rise of the lowly bourgeoise
to be mistress of France:</p>
<p>The distress and poverty in which she had so long lived had nar-</p>
<p>rowed her mind, and abased her heart and her sentiments. Her feelings
and her thoughts were so circumscribed that she was in truth always less
even than Mme. Scarron. . . . Nothing was more repelling than</p>
<p>this meanness 〔low origin〕 joined to a situation so radiant . 9</p>
<p>Even so the Duke found some virtues amid her faults:</p>
<p>Mme. de Maintenon was a woman of much wit, which the good</p>
<p>company in which she had at first been merely suffered, but in which
she soon shone, had much polished and ornamented with knowledge of the
world, and which gallantry had rendered of the most agreeable kind. The
various positions she held had rendered her flattering, in-</p>
<p>sinuating, complacent, always seeking to please. The need she had of
intrigues, those she had seen of all kinds, and been mixed up in for</p>
<p>herself and for others, had given her the taste, the ability, and
the</p>
<p>habit of them. Incomparable grace, an easy manner, and yet measured
and respectful, which, in consequence of her long obscurity, had</p>
<p>become natural to her, marvelously aided her talents; with language
gentle, exact, well expressed, and naturally eloquent and brief. Her</p>
<p>best time, for she was three or four years older than the King, had
been the dainty-phrase period — the superfine gallantry days. . . . She
put on afterwards an air of importance, but this gradually gave place
to</p>
<p>one of devoutness that she wore admirably. She was not absolutely
false by disposition, but necessity had made her so, and her natural
flightiness made her appear twice as false as she was . 10</p>

. Jacques Boulenger, The Seventeenth Century (New York, 1920), 243: “It
is evident that she had nothing to do with the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes.” And the En cyclo- paedia Britannica, XIV, 693a: “The
Revocation and the dragonnades have been unjustly laid to her charge.”
Voltaire had long ago concluded likewise ( Works , 〔New York, 1927〕
XXIa-290).</h1>
<p>688</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Macaulay, from the pathos of distance, took a more chivalrous view;
per- haps he felt that much could be forgiven in a woman who was both
“elo - quent and brief”:</p>
<p>When she attracted the notice of her sovereign she could no</p>
<p>longer boast of youth or beauty; but she possessed in an
extraordinary degree those more lasting charms which men of sense . . .
prize most highly in a female companion. … A just understanding, an
inexhaust- ible yet never redundant flow of rational, gentle, and
sprightly con-</p>
<p>versation; a temper of which the serenity was never for a moment</p>
<p>ruffled; a tact which surpassed the tact of her sex as much as the
tact of her sex surpasses the tact of ours: such were the qualities
which</p>
<p>made the widow of a buffoon first the confidential friend, and
then</p>
<p>the spouse, of the proudest and most powerful of European kings .
11</p>
<p>Finally, see her through the eyes of Henri Martin, a French historian
of inadequately recognized excellence:</p>
<p>There was a harmony of mind and manners between them 〔the</p>
<p>Marquise and the King〕 which was destined to increase with age; and
her regular, gentle, and serious beauty, heightened by rare natural</p>
<p>dignity, was essentially fitted to please Louis. She loved
consideration as he loved glory; like him reserved, circumspect, and yet
full of</p>
<p>attraction and grace, she had the same charm of conversation, and</p>
<p>sustained this charm longer by the resources of a richer imagination
and a more varied education. Like him she had the individuality of</p>
<p>vigorous and self-seeking organizations, yet she was capable of
lasting and solid, if not ardent, affections. She was at once less
passionate and more constant than the King, who was to be, in friendship
as in love, truly constant to her alone; but she had never known what it
was to sacrifice to her feelings either her interests or her repose;
contrary to Louis XIV, she was devoted in small things and devoid of
generosity</p>
<p>in great ones. . . . Her calm reflective, reasoning character,
incapable of impulse and of illusion, aided her to defend a virture
often be-</p>
<p>sieged . 12</p>
<p>In any case there must have been many admirable qualities in a woman
whom so masterful a king could choose as his wife, and whom he trusted
with cognizance of the most intimate affairs of state. Usually he met
his ministers in her private room, in her presence and hearing; and
though she maintained a discreet distance and silence, busying herself
with her needle- work, Louis “sometimes turned to her and asked her
judgment” 13 — which he valued so highly that he called her “ Votre
SoliditeT Skeptics called her “Madame de Maintenant” (Madame Now),
presuming that she would</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>CHAP, xxrv)</p>
<p>689</p>
<p>soon be joined or displaced by rivals; on the contrary, the King
remained her loving husband till his death.</p>
<p>Her influence grew with every year, and was as beneficent as her
piety would permit. She tried to moderate the Kang’s extravagance, and
to divert him from war; hence the hostility of Louvois. She secured
royal support for charities — hospitals, convents, help for bankrupt
nobles, dowries for demoiselles. 14 None but good Catholics could win
her recommendation for office. She had vines or drapes drawn over the
more vital nudities in the art that decorated Versailles. 16 She changed
St.-Cyr from a college to a convent (1693), whose doors were henceforth
closed to the world. She herself became almost a nun in a palace; “with
her shut -in life, spending hours in solitude, she seemed to have one
foot in a nunnery.” 18</p>
<p>The King began by laughing at her piety, he ended by imitating it
this side of humility. The priests about him rejoiced to see the
regularity with which he performed the rituals of devotion, but she
understood him well; the King, she said, “never misses a station of the
cross, or a penance, but he cannot understand the necessity of humbling
himself and acquiring the true spirit of repentance.” 17 Pope Alexander
VIII, however, was satisfied, and congratulated Madame upon reforming
the once antipapal Gallican. Perhaps the decline of his physical energy
after 1684, and his sufferings from an anal fistula, f urthered the
King’s piety by reminding him of his mortality. On November 18, 1686, he
submitted to a painful operation, which he bore with class-conscious
courage. For a time the anti-French coalition rejoiced in the rumor that
he was dying. 18 He survived; and when he went to Notre Dame (January
30, 1687) to thank God for his cure, all Catholic France hailed his
recovery with festive joy.</p>
<p>“From that time,” said Voltaire, “the King no longer went to the</p>
<p>theater.” 19 The gaiety -in-dignity that had characterized the
earlier half of his reign gave way to a seriousness that sometimes
neared austerity, but permitted occasional excesses of bed and board. 20
Prompted by fatigue, seconded by Maintenon, he reduced the parade and
ceremony of the court, and retired to a more private life, content with
the domesticity to which his wife had accustomed him. He was still
extravagant in his expenditures on palaces and gardens, still as proud
as his scepter and as sensual as his jowls. In March, 1686, he allowed
an obsequious courtier, Frangois</p>
<p>d’Aubusson, later Due de La Feuillade, to erect on the Place des
Victoires a. statue dedicated to him as “the immortal man”; we must add,
however, that when d’Aubusson wish ed to provide a votive lamp to be
kept lighted before the statue night and day, die King forbade this
premature assump- tion of divinity.</p>
<p>An inner circle of devout aristocrats, led by the Duke and Duchess of
Chevreuse, the Duchesses of Beauvilliers and Mortemart, and the
three</p>
<p>690</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>daughters of Colbert, formed around the King and his wife a cordon
sanitaire of devots, many of them sincerely religious, and some of them
adopting the mystic quietism of Mme. Guyon. The world-famous hymn
“Adeste Fideles” was composed by an unknown French poet about this time.
The remainder of the court joined, only outwardly, in the new mood of
the King. It abandoned its frivolity, went more frequently to Mass and
Communion, less and less to the opera and the theater, which now rapidly
declined from their heyday under Lully and Moliere. Hunts, costly
banquets and balls, and card-playing for high stakes went on, but in an
atmosphere of moderation touched with reminiscent gloom. The roisterers
and freethinkers of Paris hid their heads, waiting for revenge under an
impatiently expected Regency. But the people of France rejoiced in the
saintliness of their ruler, and silently bore, in death and taxes, the
swelling levies of war.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE GRAND ALLIANCE: 1 689-97</li>
</ol>
<p>Taxes rose even as prosperity declined. Colbert’s massive system of
state-regulated commerce and industry had begun to collapse before his
death (1683). Partly it died through the drain of men from farms and
factories to camps and battlefields. Chiefly it died through self
-strangula- tion: governmental regulations stifled the growth that might
have come under less supervision and restraint, more liberty to breathe,
to experiment, and to err. Enterprise found itself bound by a maze of
orders and penalties; the complex mechanism of economic activity, moved
by the toilsome hunger of the many and the inventive greed of the few,
groaned and stumbled under a mountain of rules, and threatened to halt.
So soon as 1685 we hear the cry of laissez faire, sixty-five years
before Quesnay and Turgot, ninety- one before Adam Smith. “The supreme
secret,” said one of Louis XIV’s intendants, “is to allow complete
freedom of trade. Never had manufacturers and commerce so wasted away in
this realm as since we have taken it into our heads to build them up by
the decrees of the state.” 21 Other factors contributed to decay.
Huguenots fleeing from persecution took with them their economic skills,
and sometimes their savings too. Commerce suffered from the King’s
desire to conquer rather than to trade. Exports were balked by foreign
tariffs retaliating against French import dues. The English and the
Dutch proved to be better seamen and colonizers than the proud and
impatient Gauls; the Compagnie des Indes failed. Taxes discouraged
agriculture, and a dishonest currency confused and palsied finance.</p>
<p>The ministers who served Louis after the death of Colbert could
not</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>6 91</p>
<p>compare in ability with those whom the King had inherited from
Richelieu and Mazarin. Colbert’s son Jean Baptiste, the Marquis de
Seignelay, re - ceived the ministries of commerce and marine; Claude Le
Peletier took charge of finance, but was soon succeeded by Louis
Phelypeaux, Seigneur de Pontchartrain; Louvois remained minister of war.
The new men were awed by Louis XIV’s accumulated glory and authority;
they feared to make decisions, and the machine of state waited upon the
burdened mind of the King. Only Louvois had a will of his own, and it
was all for war — against the Huguenots, against the Netherlands,
against any prince or people that stood in the path of expanding France.
For Louvois had built the finest army in Europe; he had trained it to
discipline and bravery, had equipped it with the latest weapons, and had
taught it the gentle art of the bayonet.* How could such a force be fed,
or keep its morale, unless it fought and won?</p>
<p>France looked upon that army with pride, all the rest of Europe heard
of it with anger and dread. When, in May, 1685, Louis claimed part of
the Elector Palatine’s estate as the inheritance of the dead Elector’s
sister Charlotte Elisabeth, now Duchesse d’Orleans, the princes of the
Empire wondered what demands would come next from the aggressive King.
The tension rose when Louis in effect bound Cologne, Hildesheim, and
Munster to France by securing the election of his nominees as their
episcopal princes (1686). On July 6 the Catholic Emperor Leopold I and
the Catholic</p>
<p>Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria joined the Protestant Great
Elector of Brandenburg, the Protestant King Charles XI of Sweden, and
the Protestant Stadholder William III of the United Provinces in forming
the League of Augsburg for defense against any attack upon their terri-
tories or their powers. The Emperor was still busy with the retreating
Turks, but their defeat at the “second Mohacs” (1687) and at Belgrade
(1688) freed the Imperial troops for action on the Empire’s western
front.</p>
<p>The King of France now made the pivotal mistake of his military
career. The Stadholder had expected him to renew the assault upon
Holland; instead, Louis decided to invade Germany before the Imperial
forces CQuld be assembled on his frontier. On September 22, 1688, he
dispatched his main divisions toward the Rhine, with a characteristic
speech to the twenty- seven-year- old Dauphin: “My son, in sending you
to command my armies, I give you opportunities of making your merit
known; show it to all</p>
<p>Europe, so that when I come to die, no one will perceive that the
King is dead .” 23 On September 25 the French army swept into Germany.
Within a month it took Kaiserslautern, Neustadt, Worms, Bingen, Mainz,
and</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Heidelberg; on October 29 the strategic fortress of Philippsburg
fell; on November 4 the triumphant Dauphin advanced to attack
Mannheim.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was these victories that began the downfall of the King.
For they committed him to a long war with a swelling host of foes; they
freed Holland from fear of an early invasion; they induced the
States-General of the United Provinces to give its consent and support
to the conquest of England by William III. As soon as he had certified
his power, William turned England from a dependency into an enemy of
France, and pleaded with his new subjects to take their part in
defending the political and re- ligious liberty of Europe. Parliament
hesitated; it suspected that William’s main interest was to save
Holland; and Holland was England’s greatest commercial competitor. But
again the victories of France strengthened William’s plea.</p>
<p>Louvois had urged Louis to let him devastate the Palatinate in order
to deprive the oncoming enemy of any local means of subsistence. Louis
re- luctantly agreed. In March, 1689, the French army sacked and burned
Heidelberg and Mannheim, then Speyer, Worms, Oppenheim, parts of the
archbishopric of Trier and the margraviate of Baden; nearly all the
German Rhineland was ruined. Voltaire described the atrocity with the
conscience of a good European:</p>
<p>It was in the heart of winter. The French generals could not but</p>
<p>obey; and accordingly they announced to the citizens of those flour-
ishing and well-ordered towns, to the inhabitants of the villages, and
to the masters of more than fifty castles, that they would have to</p>
<p>leave their homes, which were to be destroyed by fire and sword.</p>
<p>Men, women, old people, and children departed in haste. Some went
wandering about the countryside; others sought refuge in neighbor- ing
territory, while the soldiery . . . burnt and sacked the country.</p>
<p>They began with Mannheim and Heidelberg, the seats of the Electors;
their palaces, as well as the houses of the common citizens, were</p>
<p>destroyed. . . . For the second time this beautiful country was
ravaged by Louis XIV; but the flames of the two towns and twenty
villages</p>
<p>which Turenne had burned in 〔the 1674 devastation of〕 the
Palatinate were but sparks compared with this conflagration. 24</p>
<p>From all Germany, the Netherlands, and England a cry rose for
ven-</p>
<p>geance against the King of France. German pamphleteers denounced the
French soldiers as Huns dead to any human feelings; they described Louis
as a monster, a blasphemer, a barbarian worse than any Turk. German
historians taunted the French people with having received their
civilization from the Franks (i.e., Germans) and their universities from
the Holy</p>
<p>Roman emperors (i.e., Germans). 26 Pierre Jurieu, Huguenot exile in

<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE SUN SETS 693</p>
<p>land, had already published there a powerful diatribe, Les Soupirs de
la France esclave ( The Sighs of a France Enslaved), branding Louis as a
bigoted tyrant, and calling upon the French people to depose him and
establish a constitutional monarchy. The French press replied with
appeals to the citizens to hurl back these insults into the face of the
enemy, and come to the rescue of their brave, beleaguered, beloved King.
On May 1 2, 1689, England joined the Empire, Spain, the United
Provinces, Denmark, and Savoy in the first Grand Alliance, which pledged
itself to defend each of its members against external aggression. The
war was now of Europe against France.</p>
<p>Louis responded by raising his armies to 450,000 men, his navy to</p>
<p>100,000 personnel; Europe had never seen such armed hosts before. The
King melted down his silverware to help taxation pay the cost of these
multitudes; he ordered all private individuals, and many churches, to do
the same; and he allowed Pontchartrain to remint and depreciate the cur-
rency by ten per cent. The minister created new offices, restored old
ones that had lapsed, and sold them to place-seekers infatuated with
titles. “Every time your Majesty creates an office,” he said to Louis,
“God creates a fool to purchase it.” 28</p>
<p>Seignelay advised the King to order his fleet to cut off Ireland
from</p>
<p>England. It might have been done, for on June 30, 1690, Admiral
de</p>
<p>Tourville, with seventy-five ships, defeated a combined Dutch and
English fleet at Beachy Head, off the East Sussex coast. But Louis sent
only two thousand men to support James II in Ireland; a larger force
might have won the battle of the Boyne (July 1, 1690), and might have
kept England and its Dutch King too busy in Ireland to fight on the
Continent. Wil- liam III, by the victory, was free to go to Holland
(1691) and lead</p>
<p>English and Dutch troops against the French. In 1692 Louis attempted
an invasion of England; a fleet from Toulon was ordered to sail nprth
and join a fleet under Tourville at Brest; together they were to beat
down any English resistance, and carry thirty thousand troops across the
Channel. The squadron from Toulon, checked by a storm at Gibraltar,
failed to reach Tourville, who had to fight unaided the united Dutch and
English fleets; he was defeated in a decisive engagement off La Hogue,
near Cher- bourg (May 19, 1692), and the invasion was turned back. After
this vic- tory England remained mistress of the seas, free to capture
from France one after another of her colonies. The Channel protected
England till our time.</p>
<p>On land the French continued their victories, though at enormous cost
in materials and men. In April, 1691, proud to anesthesia under the eyes
of their King, they besieged and took strategic Mons. Louvois died on
July 7, but Louis was not quite displeased at being freed from his

<p>sive minister of war; he proposed henceforth to guide all military
policy himself. He observed an old French custom when he gave Louvois’
post to Louvois’ son, the amiable and tractable twenty -four-year-old
Marquis de Barbezieux. In June, 1692, Louis led his troops in person to
the capture of Namur; then, leaving the command to the Due de
Luxembourg, he returned to sip his glory at Versailles. William III
surprised the Duke at Steenkerke in July; the French, at first routed,
recovered order and courage under the direction and example of their ill
but invincible general; once more the victory was French but dearly
bought. There Philippe II</p>
<p>d’Orleans, future regent of France but not yet fifteen, fough t in
the van, was wounded, and returned to fight again. There young Louis,
Due de Bourbon-Conde (grandson of the Great Conde), veteran of three
sieges, and Fran§ois Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, and Louis Joseph
Due de Vendome (great-grandson of Henry IV), and many others of the
French nobility displayed the gallant bravery that made them, despite
their idle extravagance in peace, the idols of their people in war, and
exemplars even to the enemy. “What a nation you are!” exclaimed Count
Salm, one of their prisoners. “There are no foes more to be feared in
battle, and no more generous friends in victory.” 27</p>
<p>A year later the same French army, under the same general, defeated
William at Neerwinden, near Brussels; here too the slaughter was immense
— twenty thousand of the Allies, eight thousand of the French. No
matter</p>
<p>left with only second-rate generals. Though its soil had been
hardly</p>
<p>touched by the Allies, France was feeling the burden of a new kind of
war, in which no hired mercenaries fought the battles, but whole nations
were conscripted for competitive massacre. Even while they acclaimed
their generals, their heroes, and their victories, the French people,
taxed as never before, were nearing exhaustion in body and spirit. In 1
694 famine was added to destitution; in one diocese alone there were 450
deaths from starvation. 29 The national economy verged on collapse.
Transportation was in chaos, for the repair of bridges and roads had
almost stopped during the war. Internal trade was choked by tolls
exacted at a hundred places</p>

<p>on rivers or land. Foreign commerce, already hampered by import and
export dues, was made almost impossible by enemy fleets and privateers.
Those who had lived by coastal fishing or trade were ruined. Hundreds of
towns were depleted of their resources by their support of troops
quartered upon them. Poverty, famine, disease, and war reduced the popu-
lation of France from some 23,000,000 in 1670 to some 19,000,000 in</p>

<p>In 1694 Fenelon, soon to be archbishop of Cambrai, addressed to Louis
XIV an anonymous letter which is one of the high-water marks of the
French spirit:</p>
<p>Sire, he who takes the liberty to write you this letter has no
worldly</p>
<p>interest. He writes through neither disappointment nor amibition,</p>
<p>nor through desire to mingle in great affairs. He loves you
without</p>
<p>being known to you; he sees God in your person. . . . There is no</p>
<p>evil that he would not gladly suffer to make you recognize the truths
necessary to your salvation. If he speaks strongly to you, do not be</p>
<p>surprised; it is only because truth is free and strong. You are not
used to hearing it. People accustomed to be flattered mistake for
resent- ment, bitterness, or excess that which is only pure truth. It
would be treason to the truth not to show it to you. . . . God is
witness that he who now speaks to you does so with a heart full of zeal,
of respect, of fidelity and devotion for everything that concerns your
real inter-</p>
<p>est. . . .</p>
<p>For some thirty years past your chief ministers have overturned
all</p>
<p>the ancient maxims of state to raise your authority to the utmost,
be- cause it was in their hands. No one spoke any more of the state and
its laws; they spoke only of the King and his good pleasure. They
have</p>
<p>extended your revenues and your expenditure without limit. They</p>
<p>have raised you to the skies in order, they say, to efface the
grandeur of all your predecessors combined, but actually they have
impoverished all France to establish at the court a monstrous and
incurable luxury. They have washed to elevate you upon the ruin of every
class in the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>

<p>state — as if you could be great while ruining all the subjects
upon</p>
<p>whom your greatness depends. True, you have been jealous of author-
ity, . . . but in reality each minister has been master within the scope
of his administration. . . . They have been hard, haughty, unjust,</p>
<p>violent, and of bad faith. In domestic and foreign affairs they
have</p>
<p>known no rule but to threaten, remove, or destroy everything that</p>
<p>opposed them. . . . They have accustomed you constantly to receive
extreme praises verging upon idolatry, which, for your own honor,</p>
<p>you should have rejected with indignation. They have made your</p>
<p>name hateful — and the whole French nation unbearable — to neighbor-
ing peoples. They have retained none of our old allies, because they
wanted only slaves. They have been the cause, through twenty years, of
bloody wars . . . whose only motives were glory and vengeance.</p>
<p>… All the frontiers that have been extended by war have been un-</p>
<p>justly acquired. You have always wished to dictate peace, to impose
conditions, instead of arranging them with moderation; that is why no
peace has endured. Your enemies, shamefully struck down, have only one
thought: to stand up again and unite themselves against you. Is it
surprising? You have not even stayed within the limits of the peace</p>
<p>terms that you so proudly dictated. In time of peace you have made
war and immense conquests. . . . Such conduct has aroused and united all
Europe against you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your people, whom you should have loved as your</p>
<p>children, and who have till now been so devoted to you, are dying of
hunger. The cultivation of the earth is almost abandoned; the towns and
the countryside are depopulated; all industry languishes, and no longer
supports the workers. All commerce is destroyed. You have</p>
<p>consumed half the wealth and vitality of the nation to make and</p>
<p>defend vain conquests abroad. . . . All France is now but a vast
hos-</p>
<p>pital, desolate and without provisions. The magistrates are worn out
and despised. . . . Popular uprisings, so long unknown, increase in fre-
quency. Paris itself, so near you, is not exempt; its officials must</p>
<p>tolerate the insolence of rebels, and spread money to appease them.
You are reduced to the sad and disgraceful extremity of letting sedi-
tion go unpunished and therefore grow, or to slaughter without pity
people whom you have driven to despair by snatching from them,</p>

His. … You do not love God, you only fear Him, and with a slavish</p>

<p>and everything else were made to be sacrificed to you. On the
con-</p>
<p>trary, God has put you in this world only for your people. . . .</p>
<p>We have hoped, Sire, that your Council would draw you away</p>
<p>from the wrong road; but it has neither the courage nor the
strength.</p>
<p>At least Mme. de M. 〔Maintenon〕 and M. le D. de B.
〔Beauvilliers〕</p>
<p>might use the confidence you place in them to undeceive you; but</p>
<p>their weakness and timidity are a disgrace and scandal before the</p>
<p>world. . . . You ask, perhaps, Sire, what it is they should do.
This:</p>
<p>they should show you that you must humble yourself under the</p>
<p>powerful hand of God, if you do not wish Him to humble you; that</p>
<p>you must ask for peace, and expiate by that humiliation all the glory
which you have made your idol . . . ; that to save the state you must as
soon as possible restore to your enemies all that you cannot with</p>
<p>justice retain.</p>
<p>Sire, he who tells you these truths, far from opposing your
interests, would give his life to see you such as God wishes you to be;
and he</p>
<p>will not cease to pray for you.*</p>
<p>Fenelon did not dare send this letter directly to the King; he had it
de- livered to Mme. de Maintenon, perhaps hoping that though she might
not show it to Louis, she would be moved by it, as reflecting the mood
of the people, to use her influence for peace. She turned it over to
Archbishop de Noailles, with this comment: “It is well written, but such
truths only irritate or discourage the King. … We must lead him gently
in the way he should go.” 33 She had written in 1692: “Th e King knows
the sufferings of his people, and he seeks all means of relieving them.”
34 Doubtless she knew what reply he would have made to Fenelon: that the
maxims of Christianity could not be used in dealing with states; that a
generation of Frenchmen might justly be sacrificed if thereby the future
of France could be ensured by natural and more defensible boundaries;
and that an attempt to secure peace from the united and vengeful allies
would open France to invasion and dismemberment. Caught in the conflict
between the religion of brotherhood and the philosophy of war, Maintenon
went more and more frequently to St.-Cyr, and sought in the fellowship
of the young nuns the happiness that she had not found in power. 35</p>
<p>Toward the close of the war Pierre Le Pesant, Sieur de
Boisguillebert, lieutenant general of the region around Rouen, brought
to Pontchartrain a plan to mitigate the economic chaos and public
destitution. “Listen to me patiently,” he urged the finance minister;
“you will at first take me for a fool; then you will see that I deserve
attention; finally you will be</p>

Enlightenment , 91 -95. The letter was first published by d’Alembert in

was found in Fenelon’s own hand. 82</p>

<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>satisfied with my ideas.” Pontchartrain laughed at him and sent him
away.</p>
<p>The King and his ministers might be forgiven if they felt that a
war</p>
<p>against half of Europe was no time to attempt so far-reaching an
economic revolution. Instead of reforming the economy they raised taxes.
In 1 695 a poll or head tax was decreed, supposedly for every male adult
in France; it was excused as temporary, it continued till 1789. In
theory nobles, priests, and magistrates were to be subject to it;
actually the clergy bought exemp- tion with a moderate subsidy, while
nobles and financiers found loopholes in the law. Every device was used
to elicit money from the people. Lot- teries were organized, offices
were sold, the currency was debased, rich men were courted and prodded
for loans. The King himself entertained the banker Samuel Bernard,
luring millions from him by the hypnotism of the royal aura and charm.
Despite taxes and devices old and new, the total revenue of the state in
1697 was 81,000,000 livres; the expenses were 2 19,000,000.</p>
<p>At last Louis confessed that his victories were bleeding the life
from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE SUN SETS 699</p>
<p>France. He bade his diplomats come to terms with his enemies. Their
skill in a measure rescued him. In 1696 they persuaded the Duke of Savoy
to sign a separate peace. Louis let it be whispered that he would end
his support of the Stuarts and would recognize William III as King of
Eng- land. William himself w as finding that money was dearer than
blood. “My poverty is incredibje,” he complained, but Parliament grew
more and more reluctant to pour out pounds to supply his troops. He
required, as a preliminary to peace, the expulsion of James II from
France. Louis re- fused, but he offered to restore nearly all the cities
and terrain that his armies had won during the war. On September 20,
1697, the Peace of Ryswick (near The Hague) ended the “War of the
Palatinate” with</p>
<p>England, Holland, and Spain. France kept Strasbourg and
Franche-Comte, and regained Pondicherry in India and Nova Scotia in
America, but French tariffs were lowered to Dutch trade. On October 30 a
supplementary peace was signed with the Empire. Both the Emperor and the
King of France expected the early death of Charles II of Spain; and the
chancelleries of Europe understood quite well that what had been signed
was only a truce in preparation for a greater war, in which the prize
would be the richest empire in the world.</p>
<p>HI. THE SPANISH PROBLEM: 1698-17OO</p>
<p>Charles II, childless, was nearing death; who would inherit his
posses- sions, ranging from the Philippines through Italy and Sicily to
North and South America? Louis claimed them, not only as the son of the
eldest daughter of Philip III of Spain, but through the rights of his
dead wife, Marie Therese, eldest daughter of Philip IV. True enough,
Marie Therese at her marriage had renounced all claim to the Spanish
throne; but that renunciation had been made on condition that the
Spanish government pay 500,000 gold crowns to France as her dowry. Those
crowns had never been paid, for Spain was bankrupt.</p>
<p>The Emperor Leopold I had counterclaims. He was the son of Maria</p>
<p>Anna, younger daughter of Philip III; in 1666 he had married Margaret
Theresa, younger daughter of Philip IV; and neither of these ladies had
renounced her rights of possible succession to the Spanish crown. Always
harassed by the Turks, Leopold, for the sake of peace with France,
compro- mised his claims by signing with Louis XIV (January 19, 1668) a
secret treaty for the eventual partition of the Spanish Empire. By this
pact, says a British historian, “he virtually admitted the force of
Louis XIV’s conten - tion that the French Queen’s renunciation of her
claims was invalid.” 37</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>When, by a second marriage, Leopold had a second son, he renewed his
claims, but offered to resign them in favor of this new Archduke
Karl.</p>
<p>England, the United Provinces, and the German principalities saw with
dread the possibility that the vast realm of Spain would fall to France
or to Austria, in either case toppling the balance of power: if Louis
won, he would dominate Europe and imperil Protestantism; if Leopold won,
the Emperor, holding the Spanish Netherlands, would threaten the Dutch
Republic, and would soon reduce the autonomy of the German states.
Commercial as well as dynastic interests were involved: English and
Dutch exporters supplied most of the market for industrial goods in
Spain and her colonies, and received considerable gold and silver in
exchange; they were loath to let that trade become a French monopoly.
“The preservation of the commerce between the king dom of Great Britain
and Spain,” the British government stated in 1716, “was one of the chief
motives that in - duced our two royal predecessors to enter the late,
long, expensive war.” 38</p>
<p>Anxious to satisfy the merchants of both his native and his
adopted</p>
<p>lands, and to preserve the balance of power on the Continent, William
III proposed to Louis that France waive her claim and agree with England
that Spain, the Indies, Sardinia, and the Spanish Netherlands should be
resigned to Joseph Ferdinand, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, grandson of
Leopold; that the Dauphin of France should receive the Tuscan ports and
the “Two Sicilies” (Italy south of the Papal States) ; while the
Archduke Karl s hould be appeased with the duchy of Milan. Louis
accepted the proposal, and signed with William (October 11, 1698) the
First Treaty for the Partition of Spain. Leopold angrily rejected the
plan. Hoping to keep the Spanish empire from such fragmentation, Charles
II drew up a will (November 14,</p>
<ol start="1698" type="1">
<li>making the Electoral Prince of Bavaria his universal heir. The
Prince confused the situation by dying (February 5).</li>
</ol>
<p>Louis offered William a new division: the Dauphin to receive the
Tuscan ports, the “Two Sicilies,” and the duchy of Lorraine; the Duke of
Lor - raine to be compensated with Milan; all the rest of the Spanish
empire, including America and the Spanish Netherlands, to go to the
Archduke Karl. William and Louis signed this Second Partition Treaty on
June 11,</p>
<ol start="1699" type="1">
<li>The United Provinces agreed to it, but Charles II protested against
any dismemberment of his possessions, and the Emperor, hoping to win all
for his son, supported the Spanish position and refused to accept the
partition. Charles, as a Hapsburg, was inclined to leave all to the
Archduke; as a Spaniard, however, he hated the Austrians, and as a Latin
he preferred the French. As a fervent Catholic he asked the advice of
the Pope; Innocent XII replied (September 27, 1700) that the best plan
would be to bequeath the Spanish empire to a Bourbon prince, who should
renounce any right to the throne of France; so Spain would retain its
integrity. Apparently the</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>701</p>
<p>French diplomats outwitted the Austrians in Madrid as well as in
Rome. Public opinion in Spain, alienated by the arrogant manners of its
German Queen, agreed with the Pope. “The general inclination,” reported
the Eng - lish ambassador at Madrid, “is altogether French.” 39 On
October 1 Charles signed the fateful will that bequeathed all Spain and
its territories to the seventeen-year-old Philip, Duke of Anjou, second
son of the Dauphin, with the proviso that the crowns of France and Spain
should never be united under one head. On November 1 Charles died.</p>
<p>When news of the will reached Paris Louis was pleased but hesitant.
He knew that the passage of Spain from the Hapsburgs to the Bourbons
would be violently opposed by the Emperor, and that England and Holland
would join in resistance. A German historian gives Louis credit, at this
juncture, for pacific aims:</p>
<p>It would be unjust to say of Louis XIV that his intention had
been</p>
<p>from the beginning to throw over the Partition Treaty so soon as a
will favorable to his House should be in his hands. Even when he was
sure of such a will, while King Charles was still alive, he ordered his
am-</p>
<p>bassador in Holland to assure the Pensionary that it was his
intention to adhere to his engagements, rather than accept any offers
that might be made to him. In addition to this, he still continued his
efforts to</p>
<p>obtain the accession of the Court of Vienna to the Treaty of
Parti-</p>
<p>tion. 40</p>
<p>On October 6 Louis sent an urgent appeal to the Emperor to accept
that Second Treaty of Partition. 41 Leopold refused. Louis henceforth
considered the treaty void.</p>
<p>Immediately after the death of Charles, the Spanish Junta, or
Regency, dispatched a courier to Paris to notify Louis that his grandson
would be accepted as King of Spain as soon as he came and took the oath
to observe the laws of the realm. The Spanish ambassador at Paris was
instructed, in case of a French refusal, to bid the courier hasten to
Vienna and submit the same offer to the Archduke; 42 in any case the
Spanish empire must not be partitioned. On November 9 Louis called the
Dauphin, his Chancellor Pont- chartrain, the Due de Beauvilliers, and
the Marquis de Torcy, foreign minister, to a council in the apartment of
Mme. de Maintenon, and asked their advice. Beauvilliers pleaded for a
rejection of the Spanish offer as sure to lead to war with the Empire,
England, and the United Provinces, and he reminded the King that France
was in no condition to face such a coalition. Torcy argued for
acceptance; war, he held, was inevitable in any event; Leopold would
fight both the Partition Treaty and the will; besides, if the offer
should be rejected by the King it would certainly be welcomed by the
Emperor, and France would again be surrounded by that same</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>cordon — Spain, north Italy, Austria, and the Spanish Netherlands —
which during the last two hundred years it had cost France so much blood
to break. Better go to war for a just cause — the will — than in an
attempt to enforce the partition of Spain against the desire of its
government and its people. 43</p>
<p>After three days of further deliberation, Louis announced to the
Spanish envoys his acceptance of the will. On November 1 6, 1700, he
presented the Duke of Anjou to the court assembled at Versailles.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “you see here the King of Spain. His d escent
called him to that crown; the deceased King so ordered it in his
testament; the whole 〔Spanish〕 na- tion desired it, and earnestly
entreated me to give my assent. Such was the will of Heaven; I have
fulfilled it with joy.” And to the young monarc h he added, “Be a good
Spaniard — that is now your first duty; but remember that you were bom a
Frenchman, and maintain unity between the two nations; this is the way
to make them happy, and to preserve the peace of Europe.” 44 The Spanish
Regency proclaimed Philip at Madrid, and all sections of Spain and her
dominions soon declared their consent. One gov- ernment after another
recognized the new King: Savoy, Denmark, Portu- gal, the United
Provinces, England, several Italian and German states; even the Elector
of Bavaria — who thought his son had been poisoned by the Emperor — was
among the first princes to offer recognition. The crisis seemed
surmounted, and the century-long enmity between Spain and France seemed
peacefully healed. The Spanish ambassador at Versailles knelt in homage
to his new sovereign, and uttered famous words that Voltaire mistakenly
attributed to Louis XIV: “II n’y a plus de Pyrenees”</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GRAND ALLIANCE: 170I-2</li>
</ol>
<p>Philip V, beginning the Spanish Bourbons, was “quietly and cheerfully
received in Spain,” wrote Lord Chesterfield, “and was acknowledged as
king of it by most of those powers who afterwards joined in an alliance
to dethrone him.” 46 But the Emperor Leopold felt that this virtual
union of France and Spain, if allowed to continue, would be a disaster
for the house of Hapsburg, so long accustomed to rale both the “Holy
Roman” and the Spanish empires. Reflecting his resentment, pamphleteers
roused and ex- pressed public sentiment in Austria by pointing out that
Charles II had not been of sound mind when he bequeathed Spain to her
ancient foe; indeed, they claimed, a post- mortem showed the King’s
brain and heart grievously infected with disease; therefore his
testament was null and void, and the Spanish dominions belonged to
Leopold by the unrenounced rights</p>

<p>of his mother and his wife. Leopold urged his former allies — Holland
and England — to join him in denying or withdrawing recognition of
Philip V, even if this meant war.</p>
<p>The leader of the United Provinces at this time was Antonius
Heinsius, who had been chosen grand pensionary after William’s departure
for Eng - land. In earlier days, as Dutch envoy to France, he had been
threatened with arrest by Louvois in violation of diplomatic immunity,
and he had never forgotten that indignity. Now aged fifty-nine, he lived
in a modest house at The Hague, cherished books, walked daily to his
office, worked ten hours a day, and served as a living challenge of
bourgeois simplicity and republican government to luxurious aristocrats
and absolute kings. In November, 1700, under instruction by the
States-General, he sent to Louis XIV a memorial entreating him to reject
the will of Charles II as vitally injurious to the Emperor, and to
return to a policy of partition. Louis replied (December 4, 1700) that
his acceptance of the will had been made necessary by the Emperor’s
repeated rejection of a partition plan, and by the certainty that if
France refused the Spanish offer the Emperor would accept it.</p>
<p>The actions of Louis heightened Europe’s fear of French power. On</p>
<p>February 1, 1701, he caused the Paris Parlement to register a royal
decree reserving the eventual rights of Philip and his line to the crown
of France. This did not necessarily mean that Louis looked toward the
union of France and Spain under one king; it was probably intended to
ensure an orderly succession to the French throne in case all prior
heirs to it should be de- ceased; in that emergency Philip could
surrender the Spanish crown for that of his native land, and so continue
the Bourbon line without interrup- tion. But a further procedure of the
Kang justified a hostile interpretation. A treaty with Spain had
confirmed the right of the Dutch to guard against the invasion of
Holland by maintaining armed garrisons in some “barrier towns” of the
Spanish Netherlands. On F ebruary 5, by an understanding between Louis
and the Elector of Bavaria, who was then governing the Spanish
Netherlands, French troops entered these towns and ordered the Dutch
garrisons to depart. The Spanish ambassador at The Hague informed the
States-General that this had been done by the desire of the Spanish
government. The States-General, protesting, submitted, but Heinsius
agreed with William III that the Grand Alliance against France must be
renewed.</p>
<p>William took the position that the Second Partition Treaty had been
an agreement between himself and Louis; that it had remained valid
whether Leopold signed it or not; and that French acceptance of the
Spanish bequest had broken a solemn pact. Parliament, however, was loath
to resume the expensive struggle with France. When the French government
notified</p>
<p>704 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>England of Philip V’s succession to the Spanish throne, William
resigned himself to congratulating his “very dear brother the King of
Spain” on his “happy accession” 47 — thus giving formal recognition to
the new Bourbon regime (April 17, 1701). 48 But as the immense
consequences of the Franco- Spanish union came more clearly into view —
as the occupation of Flanders by French troops brought Louis XIV closer
to Holland, and his possession of Antwerp gave him control over English
commerce using that port — the English began to realize that the issue
was not merely between Bourbon and Hapsburg, nor only between
Catholicism resurgent and Protestantism at bay, but between English and
French domination of the seas, of Europe’s colonies, and of world trade.
In June, 1701, without declaring war, Parlia- ment engaged to sustain
William in all alliances that he might contract for the purpose of
limiting the exorbitant power of France. To implement this aim it
sanctioned the recruiting of 30,000 seamen and voted £ 2,700,000. In
response to an appeal from the States-General William ordered twenty
ships and 10,000 men to Holland, and in July he himself crossed to The
Hague.</p>
<p>The Emperor, claiming the entire Spanish dominion, was already at
war. In May, 1701, he sent an army of 6,000 horse and 16,000 foot to
seize the possessions of Spain in north Italy. He placed in command a
young prince who was destined to rival Marlborough himself as a general
— Eugene of Savoy. Eugene’s grandfather was Charles Emmanuel, Duke of
Savoy; his father, Prince Eugene Maurice, settled in France as Count of
Soissons; his mother was Olympe Mancini, one of the alluring nieces of
Mazarin. Eugene himself, aged twenty (1683), asked Louis XIV to give him
command of a regiment; refused as too young, he renounced France and
entered the Imperial service. He joined with Sobieski in the relief of
Vienna and the pursuit of the Turks; he was wounded in the capture of
Buda, and again in the siege of Belgrade; he led the Imperial army to
its decisive victory over the Turks at Senta (1697). He had every charm
except those of features and physique. An unsympathetic Gaul described
him as “this ugly little man with a turned-up nose over an upper lip too
short to conceal his teeth”; 49 but Voltaire recognized in him “the
qualities of a hero in war and a great man in peace, a mind imbued with
a high sense of justice and p ride, and a courage unshaken in the
command of armies.” 50 Now, aged thirty-eight, he guided his forces over
the Alps, outmaneuvered the French detachments there, and, with
successive victories over Catinat and Villeroi, won for the Emperor
nearly the whole duchy of Mantua (September,</p>
<p>1701), long before the War of the Spanish Succession had been
declared.</p>
<p>Meanwhile diplomacy had prepared a decade of massacre. In August
Spain granted to France the lucrative asiento — the “contract” to supply
slaves to the Spanish colonists in America; evidently France intended to
use</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>705</p>
<p>her overriding influence in Spain to capture the commerce of its
possessions on three continents. On September 7 the representatives of
England, the United Provinces, and the Empire signed the Treaty of The
Hague, form- ing a second Grand Alliance. Article Two declared it
essential to the peace of Europe that the Emperor obtain satisfaction
for his rights to the Spanish succession, and that England and the
United Provinces be made secure in their dominions, navigation, and
trade. The treaty promised to the Emperor the Spanish possessions in
Italy and the Low Countries, but it left open the possibility that
Philip V might be recognized as King of Spain. The con- tracting states
pledged themselves to undertake no separate negotiations, to sign no
separate peace, to prevent the union of the French and Spanish crowns,
to bar French trade from the Spanish colonies, and to defend and
maintain any conquests that England or the United Provinces should make
in the Spanish Indies. 61 Two months were granted France to accept these
terms; failing this, the signatories would declare war.</p>
<p>Louis met the challenge with characteristic pride. He proclaimed
himself in honor bound to defend the will of Charles II, and the resolve
of the Span- ish people that their Empire should not be dismembered. Too
confident in the power and righteousness of his cause, he appeared at
the bedside of the dying James II, and comforted him with the promise
that he would recog- nize and uphold James III as King of England. When
the father died Louis kept the promise; we do not know whether this was
a “magnanimous action” (as a magnanimous English historian called it 62
), or a surrender to the tearful pleas of the widow, 63 or a military
measure designed to divide England into supporters of William and
Jacobite supporters of a second Stuart restoration. In any case the War
of the Spanish Succession was also a war for the English succession,
even for the English soul; for a re- stored Stuart might resume the
attempt to make England Catholic. Though France felt that the action of
the allies violated the recognition that nearly all of them had given to
Philip V as King of Spain, most of England felt that Louis had violated
the Treaty of Ryswick, in which he had recognized William III as King of
England; and the recognition of James III was</p>
<p>resented as a presumptuous interference in English affairs. A clause
was added to the terms of the Grand Alliance binding its signatories to
make no peace with France till William should have received satisfaction
for the insult offered him by Louis’ action. In January, 1702,
Parliament attainted</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>706</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Provinces, and the Parliament of England simultaneously declared war
upon France.</p>
<p>V. THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION: 1702-13</p>
<p>Practically all of Europe west of Poland and the Ottoman Empire was
involved. The Alliance was joined by Denmark, Prussia, Hanover, the
episcopate of Munster, the elecorates of Mainz and the Palatinate, and
some minor German states; to these in 1703 were added Savoy and
Portugal. Together they mustered 250,000 men, and assembled a navy far
superior to the French in numbers, equipment, and leadership. France had
now 200,- 000 men in her armies, but these were distributed along many
fronts in the Rhine region, Italy, and Spain. Her only allies were
Spain, Bavaria, Cologne, and, for a year, Savoy. Spain was a liability,
requiring French armies to defend it; and the Spanish colonies were at
the mercy of the Dutch and English fleets.</p>
<p>We must not lose ourselves in the royal game of human chess that en-
sued, sanguinary almost beyond precedent. Now came the masterly and gory
campaigns of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy. Perhaps never since Caesar
had the genius of war been so combined with the art of diplomacy as in
Marlborough: skilled in the strategy of planning operations and moving
armies, in the tactics of manipulating infantry, cavalry, and artil-
lery with rapidity of perception and decision, as the needs of
battle</p>
<p>changed; and yet also patient and tactful in dealing with the
governments behind him, the personalities around him, even with the
enemies that looked to him as a statesman conscious of realities and
possessed of authority. He was sometimes merciless, and often
unscrupulous; he poured out the blood of his soldiers in any quantity
needed for success; and he communicated with James II and III to gild
his own fate should the Stuarts return to power. But he was the
organizer of victory.</p>
<p>Louis XIV, perceiving that the whole splendor of his reign now
hung</p>
<p>in the balance, and that the dispute over Spain had become a contest
for continents, called upon France to send him her sons and her gold. By
1704 he had 450,000 men under arms — as many as all his foes combined.
54 Hop- ing to bring the costly conflict to an early issue, he ordered
his main force to march through friendly Bavaria and attack the final
citadel of the enemy, Vienna itself, which even the Turkish hordes had
failed to take. An insur- rection in Hungary occupied Imperial forces in
the east, and left their capital almost denuded of defense. While a
French army under Villeroi was supposed to chain Marlborough to the Low
Countries, French troops under Marsin and Tallard joined those of the
Bavarian Elector and pressed</p>
<p>CHAP, xxrv) THE SUN SETS 707</p>
<p>farther and farther into Austria. The Emperor again, as in 1683, fled
from Vienna, knowing that his capture by the enemy would be a disaster
to the allies’ cause.</p>
<p>In this crisis Marlborough, against the pleas of the Dutch
States-General, but with the secret consent of Heinsius, decided to risk
the invasion of Holland by Villeroi, and march night and day from the
North Sea to the Danube (May to June, 1704) to save Vienna. Pretending
to seek a crossing of the Moselle, he moved southward along the river,
luring Villeroi into a parallel movement on the other side. Then
suddenly, at Coblenz, he turned east, crossed the Rhine on a floating
bridge, marched down to Mainz, crossed the Main to Heidelberg, crossed
the Neckar to Rastadt. Now he effected critical junctions with
reinforcements from Holland, with an Imperial army under Eugene of
Savoy, and with another under Margrave Louis William I of Baden-Baden.
The French and the Bavarians were aston- ished to find Marlborough so
far from the positions where Villeroi had been expected to contain him.
Marsin, Tallard, and the Elector of Bavaria gathered 35,000 infantry and
18,000 cavalry between Lutzingen and Blindheim (Blenheim) on the left
bank of the Danube. There, on August 13, 1704, Marlborough and Eugene,
with 33,000 foot and 29,000 horse, engaged them in what France tries to
forget as the battle of Hochstadt, and what England celebrates as t he
victory of Blenheim. Marlborough’s superior cavalry overwhelmed the
French center and drove Tallard’s routed army into Blenheim, where its
surviving 12,000 men surrendered, Tallard himself being captured; then
Marlborough’s horsemen rode to the suppo rt of hard-pressed Eugene on
the right, and helped him force Marsin into an orderly retreat. The
human loss was heavy: 12,000 casualties on the allied side, 14,000 on
the Franco-Bavarian. The surrender of twenty-seven bat- talions of
infantry and twelve squadrons of mounted men shattered the reputation of
French arms. The Elector of Bavaria fled to Brussels; Bavaria was
occupied by an Imperial army; nearly three hundred square miles of
terrain were cleared of French troops. Leopold returned in safety to his
capital.</p>
<p>On August 4 an Anglo-Dutch fleet marked another date in history by
capturing the barren Rock of Gibraltar. The English turned it into a</p>
<p>fortress that for two centuries made them masters of the
Mediterranean. Not knowing that it had been decided by these two
victories, the war continued for nine more years. An English fleet took
Barcelona (October 9, 1705); an allied army protected a revolt of
Catalonia against Philip V, and established the Archduke Karl at Madrid
as Charles III (June 25, 1706). But the sight of Austrians and
Englishmen ruling the country roused the Spanish from their unworldly
torpor; even the ecclesiastics urged them on to resistance. The peasants
armed themselves as best they could, and cut</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>the allied line of communications between Barcelona and Madrid; the
Eng- lish Duke of Berwick, James Fitzjames, natural son of James II, led
a</p>
<p>Franco-Spanish force from the west, recovered Madrid for Philip V
(Sep- tember 22), and drove the Archduke and his English “heretics” back
to Catalonia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Marlborough, after overcoming political obstacles in London
and The Hague, assembled an army of 60,000 English, Dutch, and Danes,
and marched into the Spanish Netherlands. On May 23, 1706, he met the
main French army of 58,000 men under Villeroi at Ramillies, near Namur.
In the ecstasy of battle, and forgetting that generals must die in bed,
he dashed to the front, and was knocked from his horse. His aide, while
help- ing the Duke to another mount, had his head blown off by a cannon
ball. Marlborough recovered, realigned his troops, and led them to
another bloody victory; his army suffered 5,000 casualties, the French
15,000. He advanced through negligible resistance to the capture of
Antwerp, Bruges, and Ostend; there he had a direct line of
communications with England, and was only twenty miles from France.
Marshal Villeroi, sixty-two, retired to his estate in grief, but with no
reproof from the King, who told him sadly, “There is no more luck at our
age.” 66</p>
<p>Everywhere now, except in Spain, the French were in peril or retreat.
In Vienna Joseph I, twenty-seven, succeeded (1705) his father as
emperor, and gave vigorous support to his generals. Eugene of Savoy
drove the French from Turin (1706), then from all Italy (1707). By the
Convention of Milan the duchies of Milan and Mantua became parts of the
Austrian Empire, and the rule of the Mantuan Gonzagas, begun in 1328,
came to an end. The kingdom of Naples, so long a viceroyalty of Spain,
fell in its turn to Austrian arms, though it continued to be formally a
papal fief. The Papal States remained papal by permission of the
Emperor, whose German troops had marched through them against the will
of the helpless Pope. 66 Venice and Tuscany preserved a precarious
independence.</p>
<p>Louis XIV was a changed man. The pride of power had almost left him,
but he maintained the calm dignity of his state. In 1706 he offered the
allies terms of peace that five years earlier they might have been glad
to accept: Spain to be surrendered to Archduke Karl; Philip to be
content with Milan, Naples, and Sicily; barrier towns and fortresses to
be restored to Dutch control in the Spanish Netherlands. The Dutch were
disposed to negotiate; the English and the Emperor refused. Louis turned
wearily to recruiting new armies and levying new taxes; even baptisms
and marriages, to be legal, had now to pay a tax. The population of
France, desperate in poverty, bap- tized its own children and married
without priestly aid, though the off- spring of such unions were
officially branded as illegitimate. 67</p>
<p>Revolts broke out at Cahors, in Quercy, in Pcrigord; peasant mobs
seized town offices and seignorial chateaux. Living skeletons (

<p>ing people clamored at the gates of Versailles for bread; the Swiss
Guard drove them away. Placards appeared on Paris walls warning Louis
that there were still Ravaillacs in France — i.e., men willing to kill a
king. 68 The new taxes were abandoned.</p>
<p>Early in 1707 the Marquis de Vauban, whose military engineering had
been a vital element in French victories a generation earlier, published
in his seventy-fourth year a proposal for a juster tax — Projet (Tune
dime royde. He described the misery of Fran ce: “Nearly a tenth of the
people are reduced to beggary, and of the other nine tenths the majority
are more in a condition to receive charity than to give it. . . . It is
certain that the evil has been pushed to excess, and that if no remedy
is applied the people will fall into such destitution that they will
never recover.” He reminded the King that “it is the lower class of the
people which, by their labor and industry, and their contributions to
the royal treasury, enrich the sovereign and his re alm”; yet “it is
that class which now, through the de - mands of war and the taxation of
its savings, is reduced to living in rags and crumbling cottages while
its lands lie fallow” in the absence of its recruited</p>
<p>Saint-Simon describes the book and its reception:</p>
<p>It was full of information and figures, all arranged with the
utmost</p>
<p>clearness, simplicity, and exactitude. But it had a grand fault.
It</p>
<p>described a course which, if followed, would have ruined an army of
financiers, of clerks, of functionaries of all kinds: it would have
forced them to live at their own expense, instead of at the expense of
the</p>
<p>people, and it would have sapped the foundation of those immense
fortunes that are seen to grow up in such short time. This was enough to
cause its failure. All the people interested in opposing the work set up
a cry. . . . What wonder, then, that the King, who was surrounded by
these people, listened to their reasons, and received with very ill
grace Marechal Vauban when he presented his book to him. 61</p>
<p>Louis reproached him as a dreamer whose plan would have upset the
finances of the kingdom in the crisis of war. A decree in council
(February 14, 1707) ordered the book to be seized and exposed in a
pillory. Six weeks later, disheartened by his disgrace, the old Marshal
died. The King uttered some words of tardy regret: “I lose a man well
affected to my person and to the state.” 62</p>
<p>The taxes and the war continued. In August, 1707, Victor Amadeus
II,</p>
<p>710 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Duke of Savoy, who had begun as an ally of France, joined Eugene of
Savoy and an English fleet in besieging Toulon by land and sea. If this
fell they planned to attack Marseilles; if that too fell, France would
be shut out from the Mediterranean. A new French army was raised, and
was sent to thrust back the invaders; it succeeded; but in that campaign
much of Provence was laid waste. In 1708 the King mustered an army of
80,000 men, placed it under Marshal Vendome and the Dauphin’s son, the
popular Duke of Burgundy, and dispatched them to stop the allied advance
in Flanders. Marlborough and Eugene, likewise with 80,000 men, met them
at Audenaarde on the Scheldt (July 11, 1708). The French were over-
whelmed, losing 20,000 in dead or wounded, and 7,000 prisoners. Marl-
borough wished to push on to Paris, but Eugene prevailed upon him to
besiege Lille first, lest its garrison cut the allies’ line of
communications and supplies. Lille was taken, but after a siege of two
months, and at the cost of 15,000 men.</p>
<p>Louis felt that France could fight no more. The misery of his
people</p>
<p>was made crueler by the severest winter in their memory (1708-9). For
two months all rivers froze; even the seas froze along the coasts, so
that heavily laden carts moved safely on the ocean ice. 63 Almost all
vegetation was killed, including the hardiest fruit trees, and all grain
in the earth. Nearly all newborn infants died in that terrible season;
64 one exception was the King’s great -grandson, the future Louis XV,
bom to the Duke of Bur- gundy on February 15, 1709. Famine followed in
the spring and summer. Monopolists cornered the bread supply and kept
the price high; Saint- Simon, usually hostile to the King, reported that
Louis himself was accused of sharing in the profits of the monopolists;
6 5 but, says Henri Martin, “his - tory is too deliberate to take the
gloomy imagination of Saint-Simon without distrust.” 66 The situation
was saved by importing twelve million kilograms of grain from the
Barbary States and elsewhere, and by planting barley as soon as the
ground thawed. 67</p>
<p>Humbled by the defeats of his armies and the calamities of his
people, Louis sent the Marquis de Torcy to The Hague (May 22, 1709) to
ask for peace. Torcy was instructed to offer the surrender of all the
Spanish empire to the allies, to cede Newfoundland to England, to
restore the barrier towns to the Dutch, and to end all French support of
the Jacobite cause. He tried to bribe Marlborough, but failed. 68 On May
28 the allies pre- sented to Torcy an ultimatum requiring not only that
Spain and all its possessions be yielded to the Archduke, but that if
Philip should not have quit Spain within two months, the French army was
to join the allies in expelling him; else (they argued) France would be
left free to reorganize its fighting power while the allies were engaged
in the Peninsula. Louis replied that it was too much to ask of him that
he should use force to expel</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>711</p>
<p>his own grandson from a Spain that had just rallied to Philip’s
support. “If I must fight 〔on〕,” he said, “it shall be with my enemies
rather than with my children.” 69</p>
<p>The demands of the allies aroused the resentment of France. Recruits
came more willingly to the colors, if only to find food; nobles sent
their silver to the mint; and French vessels, eluding the British and
the Dutch, brought from America bullion worth thirty million francs. A
fresh army was raised, 90,000 strong, and was placed under Marshal
Villars, who had never yet been defeated by the allies. At the same time
Marlborough as- sembled 110,000 men. The two swarms met at Malplaquet
(just within the French frontier against Belgium) in the bloodiest
battle of the eighteenth century. Marlborough lost 22,000 men in this
his final victory; the French suffered 12,000 casualties, including the
brave Villars, who, fifty-six years old, charged at the head of his
troops, and was borne from the field with one knee shattered by a cannon
ball. The French retreated in good order, but the allies went on to
capture Mons. “God Almighty be praised,” wrote Marlborough to his Sarah;
“it is now in our power to have what peace we please.” 70</p>
<p>It seemed so, for France had apparently made her last effort. How
could she find another army among her depleted families, or feed it from
her abandoned fields? Agriculture, industry, transport, commerce,
finance — all were in chaos, all were caught in a spreading
disintegration that invited the occupation and dismemberment of the
country by its advancing foes. The King, once the “God - given” idol of
his people, was losing their affec - tion, even their respect. He had
always shunned Paris, remembering the hostile horde of the Fronde; the
city had resented his long resentment; and the wit and insults of
pamphlets and placards had stung his absolutist pride. 71 Men wondered
why, amid the destitution of France, the halls of Versailles were still
thronged by idle, costly, gambling courtiers; though the King and his
wife were now pious and subdued, “the expenses and per - sonnel of the
court remained undiminished to the last.” 72 Some breadless Parisians
chanted a revised version of the Lord’s Prayer, sparing neither Louis
nor his mate nor his new minister of war and finance:</p>
<p>Our Father which are at Versailles, thy name is no longer
hallowed,</p>
<p>thy kingdom is no longer so great, thy will is no longer done on</p>
<p>earth or on the sea. Give us our bread, which on every side we lack.
Forgive our enemies who have beaten us, and not thy generals who allowed
them to do so. Do not succumb to all the temptations of La Maintenon,
but deliver us from Chamillard. 73</p>
<p>“The King,” mourned Madame, “is reproached for all his expendit ure;
they would like to do away with his horses, his dogs, his servants . . .
They</p>
<p>712 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap, xxrv</p>
<p>would like to stone me because they imagine that I never tell him
anything unpleasant, for fear of grieving him.” 74</p>
<p>The nobles were still loyal to the King who entertained and protected
them, but their patriotism flagged when, as a last resort, he asked for
a tenth of their income (1710). The universal dime that Vauban, three
years before, had proposed as a substitute for all other taxes, was now
added to all other taxes; and the poor had the consolation of seeing the
hated tax- gatherers enter the homes, and scrutinize the accounts, of
the rich. The King was loath to invade gilded privacy, but his
confessor, Father Le Tellier, assured him that, in the opinion of the
doctors of the Sorbonne, “all the wealth of his subjects was his, and
when he took it he only took what belonged to him.” 75 The upper middle
classes likewise suffered some cooling of martial ardor when interest
ceased to be paid on government bonds. The recoinage and debasement of
the currency “brought some profit to the King,” reported Saint - Simon,
“but ruin to private people, and a disorder to trade which completed its
annihilation.” 76 Great bankers like Samuel Bernard declared bankruptcy,
disrupting nearly all business in Lyons. “All was perishing step by
step; the realm was entirely exhausted; the troops were not paid, though
no one could imagine what was done wit h the millions that came into the
King’s coffers.” 77</p>
<p>In March, 1710, Louis again asked the allies for peace. He offered to
acknowledge the Archduke as King of Spain, to give no assistance to
Philip, even to contribute funds to aid in dethroning him. He would
surrender Strasbourg, Breisach, Alsace, Lille, Tournai, Ypres, Meenen,
Fumes, and Maubeuge to the Allies. They offered him not peace, but a two
months truce; in that period Louis, with French forces unaided by any
other, was to expel Philip from Spain; if he failed to achieve this
within the trace period, they would resume the war. 78 Louis published
these terms to his people, who agreed with him that they were
impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow France raised new armies. When the Archduke again invaded
Spain with a force of Austrian and English troops, and fought his way to
oust Philip once more from Madrid, Louis sent to his grandson 25,000 men
under the Due de Vendome. Aided by Spanish volunteers, the Duke defeated
the invaders at Brihuega and Villaviciosa (December, 1710), and so
definitely restored Philip to his throne that Spain remained Bourbon
till 1931.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the political wind was veering in England. In 1706 Queen
Anne had written: “I have no ambition . . . but to see an honorable
peace, that whenever it please God I shall die I may have the
satisfaction of leaving my poor country and all my friends in peace and
quiet.” 7 ” Anne had been kept to the war policy by Marlborough’s fiery
Duchess; that influence now waned; in 1710 the Queen dismissed Sarah,
and openly sided with the</p>
<p>CHAP, xxrv)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>7»3</p>
<p>Tories. The merchants, manufacturers, and financiers had profited
from the war, 80 and had supported the warmaking Whigs; the landowners
had lost as war raised taxes and inflated the currency; they seconded
the Queen’s longing for peace. On August 8 she dismissed Godolphin,
Marlborough’s right-hand man; Harley headed a Tory ministry; England
turned toward peace.</p>
<p>In January, 17 1 1, the English government secretly sent to Paris a
French priest, the Abbe Gaulthier, who had long resided in London.
Gaulthier went to Torcy at Versailles. “Do you want peace?” he asked. “I
come to bring you the means of concluding it, independently of the
Dutch.” 81 Negotiations proceeded slowly. Suddenly, at the surprisingly
early age of thirty-two, Joseph I died (April 17, 1711); the Archduke
became the</p>
<p>Emperor Charles VI; the English and the Dutch, who had promised him
all Spain, found that their costly victories were confronting them with
a new Hapsburg Empire as vast as that of Charles V, and as dangerous
to</p>
<p>Protestant nations and liberties. The English government now offered
Louis recognition of Philip V as King of Spain and the Spanish
possessions in America on relatively moderate conditions: securities
against the union of France and Spain under one crown; barrier
fortresses to protect the United Provinces and Germany from any future
French invasion; the restitution of French conquests; the recognition of
the Protestant succession in England, and the expulsion of James III
from France; the dismantling of Dunkirk; the confirmation of Gibraltar,
Newfoundland, and the Hudson Bay region as English property; and the
transfer from France to England of the right to sell slaves to Spanish
America. Louis assented with minor modifications; England notified The
Hague that she favored making peace on these terms; the Dutch agreed to
them as a basis for negotiation, and plans were made for a peace
congress at Utrecht. Marlborough, who had found war profitable, was
dismissed (December 31, 1711) and was replaced by James Butler, second
Duke of Ormonde, with instructions not to</p>
<p>hazard English troops in battle until further orders should be
received.</p>
<p>While the congress assembled at Utrecht (January 1, 1712), Eugene of
Savoy, considering the English terms of peace to be a betrayal of the
Imperial cause, continued the war. Day after day he pushed forward
against the line of defenses built by the industrious Villars. On July 1
6 Ormonde was notified by London that England and France had signed an
armistice, and that consequently his English regiments must be withdrawn
to Dunkirk. These obeyed, but most of the Continental contingents under
Ormonde’s command denounced the English as deserters, and placed
themselves under Eugene’s command. The Prince had now some 130,000 men,
Villars 90,000; but on July 24 the alert Marechal pounced upon a
detachment of 12,000 Dutch at Denain (near Lille), and annihilated it
before Eugene could come</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>7 1 4</p>
<p>to its aid. The Prince retired across the Scheldt to reorganize his
unwieldy army; Villars advanced to capture Douai, Le Quesnoy, and
Bouchain. Louis and France took heart. These were the only French
victories of the war on the northern front, but with the successes of
Vendome in Spain they gave new strength to the French negotiators at
Utrecht.</p>
<p>After fifteen months of protocol, punctilio, and agrument, all
parties to the war except the Emperor signed the Peace of Utrecht (April
n, 1713). France yielded to Britain all that she had promised in the
preliminaries, including that precious asiento, or slave-trade monopoly,
which lies like a badge of shame upon that age; and the ancient enemies
made mutual con- cessions on import dues. The Dutch restored to France
Lille, Aire, and Bethune, but kept control of all the Netherlands until
peace should be made with the Empire; meanwhile the Elector of Bavaria
was to hold Charleroi, Luxembourg, and Namur. Nice was returned to the
Duke of Savoy. Philip V retained Spain and Spanish America; he refused,
then (July 13) consented, to cede Gibraltar and Minorca to England.
Eugene of Savoy fought on, bitter against the British for signing a
separate peace; but the Imperial treasury was empty, his army was
reduced to 40,000 troops, and Villars was advancing against him with
120,000 men. Finally he accepted the invitation of Louis XIV to meet
Villars and work out</p>
<p>terms of peace. By the Treaty of Rastatt (March 6, 1714) France
retained Alsace and Strasbourg, but she restored to the Empire all
French conquests on the right bank of the Rhine, and she recognized the
replacement of Spanish by Austrian rule in Italy and Belgium.</p>
<p>So the treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt achieved little more than what
diplomacy might have peacefully achieved in 1701. After thirteen years
of slaughter, impoverishment, and devastation, these pacts settled for
twenty-six years the map of Europe, as the’ Treaties of Westphalia had
settled it for a generation after the Thirty Years’ War. In both cases
the</p>
<p>The chief losers in the sanguinary contest for the Spanish succession
were Holland and France. The Dutch Republic had gained terrain on land
and lost power on the sea; it could no longer match England in ship-
ping, seamanship, resources, or war; its victory exhausted it and began
its decline. France too was weakened, almost fatally. She had kept
her</p>
<p>nominee on the throne of Spain, but she had failed to preserve his
empire intact; and for this tarnished triumph she paid with a million
lives, the loss of her sea power, and the temporary collapse of her
economic life. Not till Napoleon would France recover from Louis XIV,
only to repeat his tragedy.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>715</p>
<p>The victors of the war were Austria on the Continent, and England</p>
<p>everywhere else. Austria now held Milan, Naples, Sicily, and Belgium;
she would be the strongest force in Europe until the accession of
Frederick the Great (1740). England thought more of controlling the sea
than of expanding on land; she acquired Newfoundland and Nova Scotia,
but valued more her mastery in the avenues of trade. She compelled
France to lower her tariffs, and to dismantle the fort and port of
Dunkirk, which had been a threat to English shipping. With Gibraltar in
Spain and Port Mahon in Minorca, England held the Mediterranean in fief.
These gains made no spectacular show in 1713; their results would be
written in the history of the eighteenth century. Meanwhile the
Protestant faith and succession had been made secure in Britain against
everything but the birth rate.</p>
<p>A chief product of the war was the intensification of nationalism and
international hate. Each nation forgot its gains and remembered its
wounds. Germany would never forgive the double devastation of the
Palatinate; France would not soon forget the unprecedented slaughter in
Marlbor- ough’s victories; Spain suffered every day the indignity of
Gibraltar in alien hands. Each nation bided its time for revenge.</p>
<p>Some gentle souls, thinking that Europe was a continent of
Christians, dreamed of a substitute for war. Charles Castel, Abbe de
Saint-Pierre, accompanied the French delegation to Utrecht. Returning,
he published his Pro jet . . . pour rendre la paix perpetuelle (1713) —
a plan for perpetu- ating the new-found peace. Let the nations of Europe
confederate in a league of nations with a permanent congress of
representatives, a senate for the arbitration of disputes, a code of
international law, a combined military force for action against any
rebellious state, the reduction of each national army to six thousand
men, and the establishment of uniform measures and currency throughout
Europe. 82 Saint-Pierre expounded his scheme to Leibniz, who, no longer
so sure that this was the best of all possible worlds, sadly reminded
the abbe that “some sinister fate was al - ways interposing betwixt man
and the attainment of his happiness.” 83 Man is a competitive animal,
and his character is his fate.</p>

<p>Judged in terms of his time, Louis XIV was not the ogre that
hostile</p>
<p>historians have made him; he merely applied on a larger scale, and
for a while with invidious success, the same methods of absolute rule,
territorial expansion, and martial conquest that characterized the
conduct, or the aspirations, of his enemies. Even the cruelty of his
armies in the P alatinat e</p>
<p>7 16</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>had a precedent in the sack of Magdeburg (1631), and an epilogue in
the massacres of Marlborough. Louis had the distinction of living so
long that the Furies could revenge upon him in person, rather than upon
his chil- dren, the sins of his pride and power.</p>
<p>History has not withheld from him some admiration for the courage and
dignity that he showed in defeat, and it has allowed him some pity in
the disasters that almost destroyed his children simultaneously with his
armies and fleets. In 1711 his only legitimate son, “Le Grand Dauphin”
Louis, died, leaving the King with two grandsons — Louis, Duke of</p>
<p>Burgundy, and Charles, Duke of Berry. The younger Louis developed
good qualities under Fenelon’s tutelage, and became the solace of the
monarch’s old age. In 1697 he married Marie Adelaide of Savoy, whose
beauty, wit, and charm reminded the King of Madame Henrietta and his
happy youth. But on February 12, 1712, this gay spirit succumbed to
spotted fever at the age of twenty-six. Her devoted husband had refused
to leave her sickbed; he contracted the disease, and died of it on
February 18, aged twenty- nine, only a year after his father’s death.
Their two sons caught the infection from them; one died on March 8, at
the age of eight; the younger survived, but remained so weak that no one
dreamed that he would live to rule France as Louis XV till 1774. If this
frail lad should</p>
<p>collapse, the heir to the throne would be Charles, Duke of Berry, but
Charles died in 1714.</p>
<p>There was another possible successor — Philip V of Spain, younger son
of Le Grand Dauphin; but half of Europe was pledged to keep him from
uniting the two crowns. Next in line was Philippe, Due d’Orleans, grand
- son of Louis XIII, and nephew and son-in-law of the King. But this</p>
<p>Philippe had a laboratory, carried on experiments in chemistry, and
was therefore accused, in public gossip, of having poisoned the Duke and
Duchess of Burgundy and their eldest son. The physicians who performed
the three autopsies were divided on the question whether poison had been
used. Philippe, furious under these suspicions, asked the King to give
him a public trial; Louis believed him innocent, and refused to lay upon
him the burden and stigma of such an ordeal.</p>
<p>Should these lines of succession fail, a last resort remained. The
King had legitimized his illegitimate sons, the Duke of Maine and the
Count of Toulouse. Now (July, 1714) he issued an edict — which the
Parlement of Paris registered without protest — that, in default of
princes of the blood royal, these quondam bastards should inherit his
throne; and a year later, to the horror of Saint-Simon and other nobles,
he decreed that their rank should be equal in law to that of the
legitimate princes. 84 Their mother, Mme. de Montespan, was dead, but
their foster mother, the wife of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>717</p>
<p>King, loved them as her own, and used her influence to promote them
in honors and power.</p>
<p>It was amid these problems and bereavements that Louis faced the
final crisis of the war. When he bade farewell to Villars, who was
leaving to meet the advance of Eugene on the Belgian front, the King,
now seventy- four years old, for a moment broke down. “You see my
condition,</p>
<p>Marechal,” he said. “There have been few examples of w hat has
happened to me — to lose in the same month my grandson, my
granddaughter, and their son, all of great promise, and all most
tenderly loved. God is punish- ing me. I have well deserved it; I shall
suffer less in the next world.” Then, recovering himself, he continued:
“Let us leave my domestic misfortunes, and see how to avert those of the
kingdom. I confide to you the forces and salvation of the state. Fortune
may be adverse to you. If this misfortune should happen to the army you
command, what would be your feeling as to the course which I should take
in person?” Villars did not reply. “I am not surprised,” said the King,
“that you do not answer me at once. While waiting for you to tell your
idea I will tell you mine. I know the reasonings of the courtiers;
almost all wish me to retire to Blois if my army should be defeated. For
my part, I know that armies of such size are never so much defeated that
the greater part could not fall back upon the Somme, a river very
difficult to cross. I should go to Peronne or</p>
<p>St.-Quentin, gather there all the troops I might have, make a last
effort with you, and we would perish together or save the state.” 86</p>
<p>Villars’ victory at Denain cheated the King of such a heroic death.
He survived that battle by three years, and the peace by two. Excepting
the anal fistula, long since cured, his health had maintained itself
reasonably well for seventy years. He ate immoderately, but never grew
fat; he drank moderately; he let few days pass without some active
exercise in the open air, even in the severe winter of 1708-9. It is
difficult to know if he might have lived longer with fewer physicians,
and whether the purges, bleedings, and sweats to which they treated him
were a greater curse than the ills they were intended to relieve. One
doctor in 1688 gave him so strong a laxative that it acted on him eleven
times in eight hours; after which, we are told, he felt somewhat
fatigued. 86 When Rigaud in 1701 made the painting that stands so
prominently in the Louvre, he pictured Louis as still insolent with
strength and victory and robes of state, black wig concealing white
hairs, and swollen cheeks attesting appetite. Seven years later
Coysevox, in the splendid statue in Notre Dame, showed him kneeling in
prayer, but still more conscious of royalty than of death. Perhaps the
artists clothed him in prouder pride than he felt, for in those failing
years and mounting trials he had learned to accept reproof humbly, at
least from Maintenon. 87 He became as a child in the hands of the
fanatic Jesuit Le</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Tellier, who had succeeded Pere La Chaise as the King’s confessor in
1709; “the inherito r of Charlemagne asked pardon for his sins from the
son of a peasant.” 88 The strong infusion of Catholic faith and piety
that he had re - ceived from his mother rose to the surface now that
passion ebbed and glory lost its glow. Rumor said that the King, in the
surge of his devotion, had become a Jesuit affiliate in 1705; and in his
final illness it added that he took the fourth vow as a full member of
the Society of Jesus. 89</p>
<p>In January 1715 he lost his famous appetite, and ailed so visibly
that in Holland and England wagers were laid that he would not survive
the year. 90 Reading news dispatches to this effect, he laughed them
off, and continued his routine of conferences, reception of ambassadors,
reviewing of troops, hunting, and ending the day with his
seventy-nine-year-old wife, the faithful, weary Maintenon. On August 2
he drew up a will</p>
<p>naming the Duke of Maine guardian to Louis XV, and appointing the
Duke to a Council of Regency that should rule France till the boy should
come of age. On August 12 sores broke out on his leg. They became
gangrenous and malodorous; fever set in, and he took to his bed. On
August 25 he wrote a codicil to his will, naming Philippe d’Orleans
chief of the Council of Regency, with a deciding vote in a division. To
two</p>
<p>magistrates who received this document, he said, “I have made a
testament;</p>
<p>He died like a king. After receiving the sacraments he addressed to
the ecclesiastics at his bedside a supplementary and unwelcome
confession:</p>
<p>I am sorry to leave the affairs of the Church in their present
state.</p>
<p>I am perfectly ignorant in the matter, as you know; and I call you
to</p>
<p>witness that I have done nothing therein but what you wanted, and
have done all that you wanted; it is you who will answer before God for
all that has been done. I charge you with it before him, and I have a
clear conscience. I am but a know-nothing who have left myself to your
guidance. 92</p>
<p>To his courtiers he said:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I ask your pardon for the bad example I have set you.
I</p>
<p>have to thank you sincerely for the manner in which you have served
me, and the fidelity you have always shown to me. I ask you to give</p>
<p>the same zeal and devotion to my grandson which you have given
me.</p>
<p>He is a child who may have to suffer much. I hope you will all
work</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>719</p>
<p>for union, and that should anyone fail in this, you will seek to
call</p>
<p>him back to his duty. I perceive that I am allowing my feelings
to</p>
<p>overcome me, and am causing you to do the same. I ask your pardon for
all this. Farewell, gentlemen; 1 trust that you will sometimes re-</p>
<p>member me. 98</p>
<p>He asked the Duchess of Ventadour to bring in his grandson, now five
years old. To him (according to the Duchess) he said:</p>
<p>My child, you are going to be a great king. Do not imitate me in</p>
<p>the taste that I have had for building or for war; try, on the
contrary, to be at peace with your neighbors. Render to God what you
owe</p>
<p>Him; recognize the obligations you are under to Him; make Him</p>
<p>honored by your subjects. Try to comfort your people, which un-</p>
<p>happily I have not done. . . . My dear child, I give you my
benediction with all my heart. 94</p>
<p>To two servants whom he saw in tears: “Why do you weep? Did you think
me immortal?” 95 And reassuringly to Mme. de Maintenon: “I thought it
would be harder to die than this. I assure you it is not a very terrible
business; it does not seem to me difficult at all.” 90 He asked her to
leave him, as if he were aware that after his death she would be a lost
soul in a class-conscious court. She retired to her apartment, divided
its furniture among her attendants, and departed for St.-Cyr, which she
would never leave till her death (1719).</p>
<p>The King had spoken too confidently; he suffered a long night of
agony- before he died, September 1, 1715. Of his seventy-seven years he
had spent seventy-two on the throne — the longest reign in European
history. Even before his last hour the courtiers, anxious for their
berths, had deserted him to pay homage to Philippe d’Orleans and the
Duke of Maine. Some Jesuits gathered around the corpse and performed the
ceremonies cus- tomary for one who had died in their order. 97 News of
the King’s death was received by the people of Paris as a blessed
deliverance from a reign that had lasted too long and had seen its glory
tarnished with misery and defeat. Very little pomp was wasted on the
funeral that bore to St.-Denis, on September 9, the corpse of the most
famous king in the history of France. “Along the route,” said Voltaire,
“I saw small tents set up where people drank and sang and laughed.” 98
Duclos, then eleven, later recalled that “many persons were unworthy
enough to pour forth insults on seeing the hearse pass by.” 99</p>
<p>At that moment the Parisians remembered his faults with a blinding
clarity. They felt that his love of power and glory had led France to
the brink of ruin. They resented the pride that had destroyed local
self-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>government and had centered all rule in one unchallengeable will.
They mourned the millions of francs and the thousands of lives that had
been spent in beautifying Versailles; and they cursed the neglect with
which the King had treated his turbulent capital. A small minority
rejoiced that the persecution of the Jansenists might now cease; a large
majority still applauded the expulsion of the Huguenots. In retrospect
it was clear that the invasion of Holland in 1672, the invasion of
Germany in 1688, and the hasty seizure of the barrier towns in 1701 had
been massive blunders, raising a swarm of foes around France. But how
many Frenchmen had condemned those invasions, or spoken a word of
conscience about the double devastation of the Palatinate? The nation
had been as guilty as its King, and held against him not his crimes but
his defeats. Barring a few priests, it had not condemned his adulteries,
and had shown no enthusiasm over his moral reform, his piety, or his
fidelity to his morganatic wife. It forgot now that for many years he
had graced his power with courtesy and humanity; 100 that, until the
demon of war enthralled him, he had supported Colbert in developing
French industry and trade; that he had protected Moliere against the
bigots, and Racine against the cliques; that his extravagant
expenditures had not merely indulged his own luxury but had dowered
France with a new heritage of art.</p>
<p>What the people felt most keenly and most justly was the immense
price they had paid in blood and treasure for the glory that had now
collapsed in the death of the King and the desolation of France. There
was hardly a family in the nation that had not lost a son to the wars.
Population had been so reduced that the government now gave rewards to
the parents of ten children. Taxes had stifled economic incentive, war
had blocked the avenues of commerce and had closed foreign markets to
French goods. The state was not only bankrupt; it owed three billion
francs. 101 The nobility had lost its usefulness by being turned from
local administration to prancing about the court; it had shone only in
its ex- pensive dress and its martial bravery. A new nobility had been
created by wholesale auction of titles to rich commoners; in one year
alone the King had ennobled five hundred persons at six thousand livres
each; so some ancient families fell vassal to the sons of serfs. As war
became no distant contest of mercenaries and gladiators but a pervasive
and exhausting test of national resources and economies, the middle
classes rose in number and power to challenge the baron and the priest,
and financiers prospered amid the general decline. For in modern states
the men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things;
and the men who can manage money manage all.</p>
<p>In judging Louis XIV we must remember Goethe’s humane dictum that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>THE SUN SETS</p>
<p>7 21</p>
<p>own; or, as the Romans had put it with characteristic brevity, vitium
est temporis potius quam hominis — “vices are of the age rather than of
the man .” 102 The absolutism, the persecuting bigotry, the lust for
glory, the taste for war, were in him as a child of his time and his
Church; his generos- ity and magnanimity and courtliness, his
appreciation and stimulation of literature and art, his ability to carry
a burden of concentrated and far- reaching government, were his personal
qualities, making him every inch a king. In Louis XIV, Goethe wrote,
nature produced the consummate speci- men of the monarchical type, and,
in so doing, exhausted herself and broke the mold . 103 “Louis XIV,”
said Napoleon, “was a great king. It was he who raised France to the
first rank among nations. What king of France since Charlemagne can be
compared with him in all his aspects ?” 104 “He was,” in Lord Acton’s
judgment, “by far the ablest man who was bom in modem times on the steps
of a throne .” 105 He waged devastating wars, indulged his pride
extravagantly in building and luxury, stifled philosophy, and taxed his
people to destitution; but he gave France an orderly government, a
national unity, and a cultural splendor that won for her the
unquestioned leadership of the Western world. He became the head and
symbol of his country’s supreme epoch; and France, which fives on glory,
has learned to forgive him for almost destroying her to make her
great.</p>
