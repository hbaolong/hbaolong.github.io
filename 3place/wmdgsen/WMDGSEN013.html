<p>Judea</p>
<p>I. THE PROMISED LAND</p>
<p>Palestine — Climate — Prehistory — Abraham’s people — The</p>
<p>Jews in Egypt — The Exodus — The conquest of Canaan</p>
<p>A BUCKLE or a Montesquieu, eager to interpret history through</p>
<p>geography, might have taken a handsome leaf out of Palestine.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty miles from Dan on the north to Beersheba on the
south, twenty-five to eighty miles from the Philistines on the west to
the Syrians, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites on the east-
one would not expect so tiny a territory to play a major role in
history, or to leave behind it an influence greater than that of
Babylonia, Assyria or Persia, perhaps greater even than that of Egypt or
Greece. But it</p>
<p>was the fortune and misfortune of Palestine that it lay midway
between the capitals of the Nile and those of the Tigris and Euphrates.
This cir- cumstance brought trade to Judea, and it brought war; time and
again the harassed Hebrews were compelled to take sides in the struggle
of the empires, to pay tribute or be overrun. Behind the Bible, behind
the</p>
<p>plaintive cries of the psalmists and the prophets for help from the
sky, lay this imperiled place of the Jews between the upper and nether
mill- stones of Mesopotamia and Egypt.</p>
<p>The climatic history of the land tells us again how precarious a
thing civilization is, and how its great enemies — barbarism and
desiccation- are always waiting to destroy it. Once Palestine was “a
land flowing</p>
<p>with milk and honey,” as many a passage i n the Pentateuch describes
it . 1 Josephus, in the first century after Christ, still speaks of it
as “moist</p>
<p>enough for agriculture, and very beautiful. They have abundance of
trees, and are full of autumn fruits both wild and cultivated. . . .
They are not naturally watered by many rivers, but derive their chief
moisture from rain, of which they have no want .” 3 In ancient days the
spring rains that fed the land were stored in cisterns or brought back
to the surface by a multitude of wells, and distributed over the country
by a network</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>300 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>of canals; this was the physical basis of Jewish civilization. The
soil, so nourished, produced barley, wheat and corn, the vine throve on
it, and trees bore olives, figs, dates or other fruits on every slope.
When war came and devastated these artifically fertile fields, or when
some con- queror exiled to distant regions the families that had cared
for them, the desert crept in eagerly, and in a few years undid the work
of genera- tions. We cannot judge the fruitfulness of ancient Palestine
from the barren wastes and timid oases that confronted the brave Jews
who in our own time returned to their old home after eighteen centuries
of exile, dispersion and suffering.</p>
<p>History is older in Palestine than Bishop Ussher supposed.
Neanderthal remains have been unearthed near the Sea of Galilee, and
five Neander- thal skeletons were recently discovered in a cave near
Haifa; it appears likely that the Mousterian culture which flourished in
Europe about 40,000 B.c. extended to Palestine. At Jericho neolithic
floors and hearths have been exhumed that carry back the history of the
region down to a Middle Bronze Age (2000-1600 b.c.), in which the towns
of Palestine and Syria had accumulated such wealth as to invite conquest
by Egypt. In the fif- teenth century before Christ Jericho was a
well-walled city, ruled by kings acknowledging the suzerainty of Egypt;
the tombs of these kings, ex- cavated by the Garstang Expedition,
contained hundreds of vases, funerary offerings, and other objects
indicating a settled life at Jericho in the time of the Hyksos
domination, and a fairly developed civilization in the days of
Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.* It becomes apparent that the different
dates at which we begin the history of divers peoples are merely the
marks of our ignorance. The Tell-el-Amarna letters carry on the general
picture of Palestinian and Syrian life almost to the entrance of the
Jews into the valley of the Nile. It is probable, though not certain,
that the “Habiru” spoken of in this correspondence were Hebrews. # ‘</p>
<p>The Jews believed that the people of Abraham had come from Ur in
Sumeria,’ and had settled in Palestine (ca. 2200 b.c.) a thousand
years</p>
<ul>
<li>The discoveries here summarized have restored considerable credit to
those chapters of Genesis that record the early traditions of the Jews.
In its outlines, and barring supernatural incidents, the story of the
Jews as unfolded in the Old Testament has stood the test of criticism
and archeology; every year adds corroboration from documents, monuments,
or excavations. E.g., potsherds unearthed at Tel Ad-Duweir in 1935 bore
Hebrew inscriptions confirming part of the narrative of the Books of
Kings. 48 We must accept the Biblical account provisionally until it is
disproved. Cf. Petrie, Egypt and Israel , London, 1925, p. 108.</li>

<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>or more before Moses; and that the conquest of the Canaanites was
merely a capture by the Hebrews of the land promised them by their God.
The Amraphael mentioned in Genesis (xiv, 1) as “King of Shinar in those
days” was probably Amarpal, father of Hammurabi, and his</p>
<p>predecessor on the throne of Babylon. 8 There are no direct
references in contemporary sources to either the Exodus or the conquest
of Canaan; 7 and the only indirect reference is the stele erected by
Pharaoh Memeptah (ca. 1225 b.c.), part of which reads as follows:</p>
<p>The kings are overthrown, saying “Salam!” . . .</p>
<p>Wasted is Tehenu,</p>
<p>The Hittite land is pacified,</p>
<p>Plundered is Canaan, with every evil, . . .</p>
<p>Israel is desolated, her seed is not;</p>
<p>Palestine has become a widow for Egypt,</p>
<p>All lands are united, they are pacified;</p>
<p>Every one that is turbulent is bound by King Merneptah . 8</p>
<p>This does not prove that Memeptah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus; it
proves little except that Egyptian armies had again ravaged Palestine.
We cannot tell when the Jews entered Egypt, nor whether they came to it
as freemen or as slaves.* We may take it as likely that the immi- grants
were at .first a modest number, 11 and that the many thousands of Jews
in Egypt in Moses’ time were the consequence of a high birth rate; as in
all periods, “the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
grew.” 13 The story of the “bondage” in Egypt, of the use of the Jews as
slaves in great construction enterprises, their rebellion and escape —
or emigration — to Asia, has many internal signs of essential truth,
mingled, of course, with supernatural interpolations customary in all
the historical writing of the ancient East. Even the story of Moses must
not be rejected offhand; it is astonishing, however, that no mention is
made of him by either Amos or Isaiah, whose preaching appears to have
preceded by a century the composition of the Pentateuch, f</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps they followed in the track of the Hyksos, whose Semitic rule
in Egypt might have offered them some protection . 0 Petrie, accepting
the Bible figure of four hundred and thirty years for the stay of the
Jews in Egypt, dates their arrival about 1650 b . c ., their exit about
1220 b . c . 10</li>
</ul>
<p>fManetho, an Egyptian historian of the third century b.c., as
reported by Josephus, tells us that the Exodus was due to the desire of
the Egyptians to protect themselves from a plague that had broken out
among the destitute and enslaved Jews, and that Moses was an Egyptian
priest who went as a missionary among the Jewish “lepers,” and gave</p>
<p>302 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. Xn</p>
<p>When Moses led the Jews to Mt. Sinai he was merely following the</p>
<p>route laid down by Egyptian turquoise-hunting expeditions for a
thousand years before him. The account of the forty years’ wandering in
the</p>
<p>desert, once looked upon as incredible, now seems reasonable enough
in a traditionally nomadic people; and the conquest of Canaan was but
one more instance of a hungry nomad horde falling upon a settled
community. The conquerors killed as many as they could, and married the
rest.</p>
<p>Slaughter was unconfined, and (to follow the text) was divinely
ordained and enjoyed; 10 Gideon, in capturing two cities, slew 120,000
men; only in the annals of the Assyrians do we meet again with such
hearty killing , or easy counting. Occasionally, we are told, “the land
rested from</p>
<p>war.” 00 Moses had been a patient statesman, but Joshua was only a
plain, blunt warrior; Moses had ruled bloodlessly by inventing
interviews with God, but Joshua ruled by the second law of nature — that
the superior killer survives. In this realistic and unsentimental
fashion the Jews took their Promised Land.</p>

<p>Rise of the social problem in Israel</p>
<p>Of their racial origin we can only say vaguely that they were
Semites, not sharply distinct or different from the other Semites of
western Asia; it was their history that made them, not they who made
their history. At their very first appearance they are already a mixture
of many stocks — only by the most unbelievable virtue could a “pure”
race have existed</p>

18 Greek and Roman writers repeat this explanation of the Exodus ; 14
but their anti-Semitic inclinations make them unreliable guides. One
verse of the Biblical account supports Ward’s interpretation</p>
<p>Moses is an Egyptian rather than a Jewish name; perhaps it is a
shorter form of Ahmose . 19 Professor Garstang, of the Marston
Expedition of the University of Liverpool, claims to have discovered, in
the royal tombs of Jericho, evidence that Moses was rescued (precisely
in 1527 b.c.) by the then Princess, later the great Queen, Hatshepsut;
that he was brought up by her as a court favorite, and fled from Egypt
upon the accession of her enemy, Thutmose III . 17 He believes that the
material found in these tombs confirms the story of the fall of Jericho
(Joshua, vi); he dates this fall ca. 1400 b.c., and the Exodus ca. 1447
b.c . 18 As this chronology rests upon the precarious dating of scarabs
and pottery, it must be received with respectful scepticism.</p>

<p>among the thousand ethnic cross-currents of the Near East. But the
Jews were the purest; of all, for they intermarried only very
reluctantly with other peoples. Hence they have maintained their type
with astonish- ing tenacity; the Hebrew prisoners on the Egyptian and
Assyrian reliefs, despite the prejudices of the artist, are recognizably
like the Jews of our own time: there, too, are the long and curved
Hittite nose, # the projecting cheek-bones, the curly hair and beard;
though one cannot see, under the Egyptian caricature, the scrawny
toughness of body, the subtlety and obstinacy of spirit, that have
characterized the Semites from the “stiff - necked” followers of Mose s
to the inscrutable Bedouins and trades- men of today. In the early years
of their conquest they dressed in simple tunics, low-crowned hats or
turban-like caps, and easy-going sandals; as wealth came they covered
their feet with leather shoes, and their tunics with fringed kaftans.
Their women, who were among the most beautiful of antiquity, t painted
their cheeks and their eyes, wore all the jewelry they could get, and
adopted to the best of their ability the newest styles from Babylon,
Nineveh, Damascus or Tyre . 21</p>
<p>Hebrew was among the most majestically sonorous of all the languages
of the earth. Despite its gutturals, it was full of masculine music;
Renan described it as “a quiver full of arrows, a trumpet of brasses
crashing through the air .” 22 It did not differ much from the speech of
the Phoeni - cians or the Moabites. The Jews used an alphabet akin to
the Phoenician ; 23 some scholars believe it to be the oldest alphabet
known. 23 ” They did not bother to write vowels, leaving these for the
sense to fill in; even today the Hebrew vowels are mere points adorning
the consonants.</p>
<p>The invaders never formed a united nation, but remained for a long
time as twelve more or less independent tribes, organized and ruled on
the principles not of the state but of the patriarchal family. The
oldest head of each family group participated in a council of elders
which was the last court of law and justice in the tribe, and which
cooperated with the leaders of other tribes only under the compulsion of
dire emergency. The family was the most convenient economic unit in
tilling the fields and tending the flocks; this was the source of its
strength, its authority, and its political power. A measure of family
communism softened the rigors of paternal discipline, and created
memories to which the prophets harked back disconsolately in more
individualistic days. For when, under</p>

<p>Solomon, industry came to the towns, and made the individual the new
economic unit of production, the authority of the family weakened, even
as today, and the inherent order of Jewish life decayed.</p>
<p>The “judges” to whom t he tribes occasionally gave a united obedience
were not magistrates, but chieftains or warriors — even when they were
priests . 24 *’In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man
did that</p>
<p>And Samuel said, This will be the manner of the king that shall</p>
<p>reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for him-</p>
<p>self, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall
run</p>
<p>before his chariots. And he will appoint them captains over
thous-</p>
<p>ands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his
ground,</p>
<p>and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and</p>
<p>instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to
be</p>
<p>confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will</p>
<p>take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even
the</p>
<p>best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take
your</p>
<p>menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and
your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth</p>
<p>of your sheep, and ye shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out</p>
<p>in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you;</p>
<p>and the Lord will not hear you in that day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;</p>
<p>and they said, Nay, but we shall have a king over us; that we
also</p>
<p>may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and</p>
<p>go out before us, and fight our battles . 28</p>
<p>Their first king, Saul, gave them good and evil instructively:
fought</p>
<p>their battles bravely, lived simply on his own estate at Gileah,
pursued young David with murderous attentions, and was beheaded in
flight from the Philistines. The Jews learned, then, at the first
opportunity, that wars of succession are among the appanages of
monarchy. Unless the little epic of Saul, Jonathan and David is merely a
masterpiece of literary</p>

<p>305</p>
<p>creation* (for there is no contemporary mention of these
personalities outside the Bible), this first king, after a bloody
interlude, was succeeded by David, heroic slayer of Goliath, tender
lover of Jonathan and many maidens, half -naked dancer of wild dances ,
88 seductive player of the harp, sweet singer of marvelous songs, and
able king of the Jews for almost forty years. Here, so early in
literature, is a character fully drawn, real with all the contradictory
passions of a living soul: as ruthless as his</p>
<p>time, his tribe and his god, and yet as ready to pardon his enemies
as Caesar was, or Christ; putting captives to death wholesale, like
any</p>
<p>Assyrian monarch; charging his son Solomon to “bring down to the
grave with blood” the “hoar head” of old Shimei who had cursed him many
years before ; 28 taking Uriah’s wife into his harem incontinently, and
send - ing Uriah into the front line of battle to get rid of him ; 30
accepting Nathan’s rebuke humbly, but keeping the lovely Bathsheba none
the less; forgiving Saul almost seventy times seven, merely taking his
shield when he might have taken his life; sparing and supporting
Mephibosheth, a possible pretender to his throne; pardoning his
ungrateful son Absalom, who had been caught in armed rebellion, and
bitterly mourning that so n’s death in treasonable battle against his
father (“O my son Absalom! my son, my son, Absalom! would God I had died
for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!”) 31 — this is an authentic man, of
full and varied elements, bearing within him all the vestiges of
barbarism, and all the promise of civilization.</p>
<p>On coming to the throne Solomon, for his peace of mind, slew all
rival claimants. This did not disturb Yahveh, who, taking a liking to
the young king , promised him wisdom beyond all men before or after him
. 33 Per- haps Solomon deserves his reputation; for not only did he
combine in his own life the epicurean enjoyment of every pleasure and
luxury with a stoic fulfillment of all his obligations as a king,f but
he taught his people the values of law and order, and lured them from
discord and war to in- dustry and peace. He lived up to his name, | for
during his long reign Jerusalem, which David had made the capital, took
advantage of this un- wonted quiet, and increased and multiplied its
wealth. Originally the city§ had been built around a well; then it had
been turned into a fortress</p>

<p>30 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>because of its exalted position above the plain; now, though it was
not on the main lines of trade, it became one of the busiest markets of
the Near East. By maintaining the good relations that David had
established with King Hiram of Tyre, Solomon encouraged Phoenician
merchants to direct their caravans through Palestine, and developed a
profitable ex- change of agricultural products from Israel for the
manufactured articles of Tyre and Sidon. He built a fleet of mercantile
vessels on the Red</p>
<p>Sea, and persuaded Hiram to use this new route, instead of Egypt, in
trading with Arabia and Africa . 34 It was probably in Arabia that
Solomon mined the gold and precious stones of “Ophir”; 33 probably from
Arabia that the Queen of “Sheba” came to seek his friendship, and
perhaps his aid . 33 We are told that “the weight of gold that came to
Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of
gold”; 33 and though this could not compare with the revenues of
Babylon, Nineveh or Tyre, it lifted Solomon to a place among the richest
potentates of his time.*</p>
<p>Some of this wealth he used for his private pleasure. He indulged</p>
<p>particularly his hobby for collecting concubines — though historians
un- dramatically reduce his “seven hundred wives and three hundred concu
- bines” to sixty and eighty . 33 Perhaps by some of these marriages he
wished to strengthen his friendship with Egypt and Phoenicia; perhaps,
like Rameses II, he was animated with a eugenic passion for transmitting
his superior abilities. But most of his revenues went to the
strengthening of his government and the beautification of his capital.
He repaired the citadel around which the city had been built; he raised
forts and stationed garrisons at strategic points of his realm to
discourage both invasion and revolt. He divided his kingdom, for
administrative purposes, into twelve districts which deliberately
crossed the tribal boundaries; by this plan he hoped to lessen the
clannish separatism of the tribes, and to weld them into one people. He
failed, and Judea failed with him. To finance his government he
organized expeditions to mine precious metals, and to import luxuries
and strange delicacies — e.g., “ivory, apes and peacocks” 40 — which
could be sold to the growing bourgeoisie at high prices; he levied</p>

<li>On the value of the talent in the ancient Near East cf. p. 228
above. The value varied from time to time; but we should not be
exaggerating it if we rated the talent, in Solomon’s day, as having a
purchasing power of over 0,000 in our contemporary money. Probably the
Hebrew writer spoke in a literary way, and we must not take his figures

<p>tolls upon ,all caravans passing through Palestine; he put a poll tax
upon all his subject peoples, required contributions from every district
except his own, and reserved to the state a monopoly of the trade in
yam, horses and chariots.“ Josephus assures us that Solomon “made silver
as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones in the street .” 13 Finally he
resolved to adorn the city with a new temple for Yahveh and a new palace
for himself.</p>
<p>We gather some sense of the turbulence of Jewish life from the fact
that before this time there had been, apparently, no temple at all in
Judea, not even in Jerusalem; the people had sacrificed to Yahveh in
local sanctuaries or on crude altars in the hills . 13 Solomon called
the more sub- stantial burghers together, announced his plans for a
temple, pledged to it great quantities of gold, silver, brass, iron,
wood and precious stones from his own stores, and gently suggested that
the temple would welcome contributions from the citizens. If we may
believe the chronicler, they pledged for his use five thousand gold
talents, ten thousand silver talents, and as much iron and brass as he
might need; “and they with whom</p>
<p>precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of
the Lord .” 11 The site chosen was on a hill; the walls of the Temple
rose, like the Parthenon, continuously from the rocky slopes.* The
design was in the style that the Phoenicians had adopted from Egypt,
with decorative ideas from Assyria and Babylon. The Temple was not a
church, but a quadrangular enclosure composed of several buildings. The
main struc- ture was of modest dimensions — about one hundred and
twenty-four feet in length, fifty-five in breadth, and fifty-two in
height; half the length of the Parthenon, a quarter of the length of
Chartres . 10 The Hebrews who came from all- Judea to contribute to the
Temple, and later to wor- ship in it, forgivably looked upon it as one
of the wonders of the world; they had not seen the immensely greater
temples of Thebes, Babylon and Nineveh. Before the main structure rose a
“porch” some one hundred and eighty feet high, overlaid with gold. Gold
was spread lavishly about, if we may credit our sole authority: on the
beams of the main ceiling, on the posts, the doors and the walls, on the
candelabra, the lamps, the snuffers , the spoons, the censers, and “a
hundred basins of gold.” Precious stones were inlaid here and there, and
two gold-plated cherubim guarded the Ark of the Covenant.“ The walls
were of great square stones; the ceil- ing, posts and doors were of
carved cedar and olive wood. Most of the</p>

covered by the Moslem shrine El-haram-esh-sharif; but no remains of the
Temple have been found . 45</li>

<p>building materials were brought from Phoenicia, and most of the
skilled work was done by artisans imported from Sidon and Tyre.“ The
unskilled labor was herded together by a ruthless corvee of 1 50,000
men, after the fashion of the time.“</p>
<p>So for seven years the Temple rose, to provide for four centuries
a</p>
<p>lordly home for Yahveh. Then for thirteen years more the artisans and
people labored to build a much larger edifice, for Solomon and his
harem. Merely one wing of it — “the house of the forest of Lebanon”— was
four times as large as the Temple.® The walls of the main building were
made of immense stone blocks fifteen feet in length, and were ornamented
with statu- ary, reliefs and paintings in the Assyrian style. The palace
contained halls for the royal reception of distinguished visitors,
apartments for the King, separate quarters for the more important wives,
and an arsenal as the final basis of government. Not a stone of the
gigantic edifice survives, and its site is unknown.®</p>
<p>Having established his kingdom, Solomon settled down to enjoy it.</p>
<p>As his reign proceeded he paid less and less attention to religion
and fre- quented his harem rather more than the Temple. The Biblical
chroniclers reproach him bitterly for his gallantry in building altars
to the exotic deities of his foreign wives, and cannot forgive his
philosophical — or per- haps political — impartiality to the gods. The
people admired his wisdom, but suspected in it a certain centripetal
quality; the Temple and the palace had cost them much gold and blood,
and were not more popular with them than the Pyramids had been with the
workingmen of Egypt. The upkeep of these establishments required
considerable taxation, and few governments have made taxation popular.
When he died Israel was ex- hausted, and a discontented proletariat had
been created whose labor found no steady employment, and whose
sufferings were to transform the warlike cult of Yahveh into the almost
socialistic religion of the</p>

<p>gave Yahveh a home, but it gave Judea a spiritual center and capital,
a vehicle of tradition, a memory to serve as a pillar of fire through
centuries of wandering over the earth. And it played its part in lifting
the Hebrew religion from a primitive polytheism to a faith intense and
intolerant, but none the less one of the creative creeds of history.</p>
<p>As they first entered the historic scene the Jews were nomad Bedouins
who feared the djinns of the air, and worshiped rocks, cattle, sheep,
and the spirits of caves and hills.” The cult of the bull, the sheep and
the</p>
<p>lamb was not neglected; Moses could never quite win his flock from
adoration of the Golden Calf, for the Egyptian worship of the bull was
still fresh in their memories, and Yahveh was for a long time symbolized
in that ferocious vegetarian. In Exodus (xxxii, 25-28) we read how the
Jews indulged in a naked dance before the Golden Calf, and how Moses and
the Levites — or priestly class — slew three thousand of them in punish-
ment of their idolatry.* Of serpent worship there are countless traces
in early Jewish history, from the serpent images found in the oldest</p>
<p>ruins , 61 to the brazen serpent made by Moses and worshiped in the
Temple until the time of Hezekiah (ca. 720 b . c .). 65 As among so many
peoples, the snake seemed sacred to the Jews, partly as a phallic symbol
of virility, partly as typifying wisdom, subtlety and eternity —
literally because of its ability to make both ends meet . 60 Baal,
symbolized in conical upright stones much like the linga of the Hindus,
was venerated by some of the Hebrews as the male principle of
reproduction, the husband of the land that he fertilized . 67 Just as
primitive polytheism survived in the worship of angels and saints, and
in the teraphim, or portable idols, that served as household gods , 66
so the magical notions rife in the early cults persisted to a late day
despite the protests of prophets and priests. The people seem to have
looked upon Moses and Aaron as magicians , 66 and to have patronized
professional diviners and sorcerers. Divination was sought at times by
shaking dice ( Urim and Thummim) out of a box ( ephod) — z ritual still
used to ascertain the will of the gods. It is to the credit of the
priests that they opposed these practices, and preached an exclusive
reli- ance on the magic of sacrifice, prayer and contributions.</p>
<p>Slowly the conception of Yahveh as the one national god took form,
and gave to Jewish faith a unity and simplicity lifted up above the

Jews took one of the gods of Canaan, Yahu,* and re-created him in their
own image as a stem, warlike, “stiff - necked” deity, with almost lova
ble limitations. For this god makes no claim to omniscience: he asks the
Jews to identify their homes by sprinkling them with the blood of the
sacrificial lamb, lest he should destroy their children inadvertently
along with the first-bom of the Egyptia ns” he is not above making
mistakes, of which man is his worst; he regrets, too late, that he
created Adam, or allowed Saul to become king. He is, now and then,
greedy, irascible, bloodthirtsy, capricious, petulant: “I will be
gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy to whom I will
show mercy .” 83 He approves Jacob’s use of deceit in revenging himself
upon Laban ; 83 his conscience is as flexible as that of a bishop in
politics. He is talkative, and likes to make long</p>
<p>speeches; but he is shy, and will not allow men to see anything of
him but his hind parts . 84 Never was there so thoroughly human a
god.</p>
<p>Originally he seems to have been a god of thunder, dwelling in
the</p>
<p>hills , 88 and worshiped for the same reason that the youthful Gorki
was a believer when it thundered. The authors of the Pentateuch, to whom
religion was an instrument of statesmanship, formed this Vulcan into
Mars, so that in their energetic hands Yahveh became predominantly an
imperialistic, expansionist God of Hosts, who fights for his people as
fiercely as the gods of the Iliad. “The Lord is a man of war,” says</p>
<p>“Moses”; 88 and David echoes him: “He teacheth my hands to war.””
Yahveh promises to “destroy all the people to whom” the Jews “shall
come,” and to drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite and the Hittite “by
little and little”; 88 and he claims as his own all the territory
conquered by</p>

Be- cause the Jews “commit whoredom” with the daughters of Moab he bids
Moses: “Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the
Lord against the s un”;” it is the morality of Ashurbanipal and Ashur.
He offers to show mercy to those who love him and keep his commandments,
but, like some resolute germ, he will punish children for the sins of
their fathers, their grandfathers, even their great-great-
grandfathers.™ He is so ferocious that he thinks of destroying all the
Jews for worshiping the Golden Calf; and Moses has to argue with him
that he should control himself. “Turn from thy fierce wrath,” the man
tells his god, “and</p>
<p>repent of this evil ag ainst thy people”; and “the Lord repented of
the evil which he thought to do unto his people.”™ Again Yahveh proposes
to exterminate the Jews root and branch for rebelling against Moses, but
Moses appeals to his better nature, and bids him think what people will
say when they hear of such a thing.™ He asks a cruel test— human
sacrifice of the bitterest sort — from Abraham. Like Moses, Abraham
teaches Yahveh the principles of morals, and persuades him not to
destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if there shall be found fifty — forty —
thirty — twenty — ten good men in those cities™ bit by bit he lures his
god towards decency, and illustrates the manner in which the moral
development of man compels the periodical re-creation of his deities.
The curses with which Yahveh threatens his chosen people if they disobey
him are models of vitupera- tion, and inspired those who burned heretics
in the Inquisition, or ex- communicated Spinoza:</p>
<p>Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the</p>
<p>field. . . . Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit
of</p>

Jews, or by himself; all that he asked, in the First Commandment, was

<p>he should be placed above the rest. “I am a jealous god,” he
confesses, and he bids his followers “utterly overthrow” his rivals, and
“quite break down their images .” 77 The Jews, before Isaiah, seldom
thought of Yahveh as the</p>
<p>Judah”; and the gloomy prophet goes on to protest against the worshi
p of Baal and Moloch by his people . 82 With the growth of political
unity un- der David and Solomon, and the centering of worship in the
Temple at Jeru- salem, theology reflected history and politics, and
Yahveh became the sole god of the Jews. Beyond this “henotheism”* they
made no further prog - ress towards monotheism until the Prophets. t
Even in the Yahvistic stage the Hebraic religion came closer to
monotheism than any other pre-Prophet- ic faith except the ephemeral
sun-worship of Ikhnaton. At least equal as sentiment and poetry to the
polytheism of Babylonia and Greece, Judaism was immensely superior to
the other religions of the time in majesty and power, in philosophic
unity and grasp, in moral fervor and influence.</p>
<p>This intense and sombre religion never took on any of the ornate
ritual and joyous ceremonies that marked the worship of the Egyptian and
Baby- lonian gods. A sense of human nothingness before an arbitrary
deity dark- ened all ancient Jewish thought. Despite the efforts of

<p>f Elisha, however, as far back as the ninth cent ury b.c., announced
one God: “I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel .”
83 It should be remembered that even</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>3 l 3</p>
<p>tify the cult of Yahveh with color and sound, the worship of this
awful divinity remained for many centuries a religion of fear rather
than of love. One wonders, in looking back upon these faiths, whether
they brought as much consolation as terror to humanity. Religions of
hope and love are a luxury of security and order; the need for striking
fear into a subject or rebellious people made most primitive religions
cults of mystery and dread. The Ark of the Covenant, containing the
sacred scrolls of the Law, sym- bolized by its untouchability the
character of the Jewish creed. When the pious Uzzah, to prevent the Ark
from falling into the dust, caught it for a moment in his hands, “the
anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for
his error; and there he died .” 81</p>
<p>The central idea in Judaic theology was that of sin. Never has
another people been so fond of virtue — unless it was those Puritans who
seemed to step out of the Old Testament with no interruption of Catholic
centuries. Since the flesh was weak and the Law complex, sin was
inevitable, and the Jewish s pirit was often overcast with the thought
of sin’s consequences, from the withholding of rain to the ruin of all
Israel. There was no Hell in this faith as a distinctive place of
punishment; but almost as bad was the Sheol, or “land of darkness” under
t he earth, which received all the dead, good and wicked alike, except
such divine favorites as Moses, Enoch and Elijah. The Jews, however,
made little reference to a life beyond the grave; their creed said
nothing of personal immortality, and confined its rewards and
punishments to this mundane life. Not until the Jews had lost hope of
earthly triumph did they take over, probably from Persia and per- haps
also from Egypt, the notion of personal resurrection. It was out of this
spiritual denouement that Christianity was born.</p>
<p>The threat and consequence of sin might be offset by prayer or
sacrifice. Semitic, like “Aryan,” sacrifice began by offering human
victims ; 85 then it offered animals — the “first fruits of the flocks”—
and food from the fields; finally it compromised by offering praise. At
first no animal might be eaten unless killed and blessed by the priest,
and offered for a moment to the god . 80 Circumcision partook of the
nature of a sacrifice, and perhaps of a commutation: the god took a part
for the whole. Menstruation and child- birth, like sin, made a person
spiritually unclean, and necessitated ritual purification by priestly
sacrifice and prayer. At every turn tabus hedged in the faithful; sin
lay potential in almost every desire, and donations were re- quired in
atonement for almost every sin.</p>
<p>Only the priests could offer sacrifice properly, or explain
correctly</p>
<p>the ritual and mysteries of the faith. The priests were a closed
caste, to</p>
<p>314 the story of civilization (chap. XII</p>
<p>which none but the descendants of Levi* could belong. They could not.
inherit property,“ but they were exempt from all taxation, toll, or
tribute ;“ they levied a tithe upon the harvests of the flocks, and
turned to their own use such offerin gs to the Temple as were left
unused by the god.” After the Exile, the wealth of the clergy grew with
that of the renascent community; and since this sacerdotal wealth was
well administered, augmented and preserved, it finally made the priests
of the Second</p>
<p>Temple, in Jerusalem as in Thebes and Babylon, more powerful than the
king.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the growth of clerical power and religious education</p>
<p>never quite sufficed to win the Hebrews from superstition and
idolatry. The hill-tops and groves continued to harbor alien gods and to
witness secret rites; a substantial minority of the people prostrated
themselves before sacred stones, or worshiped Baal or Astarte, or
practised divination in the Babylonian manner, or set up images and
burned incense to them, or knelt before the brazen serpent or the Golden
Calf, or filled the</p>
<p>Temple with the noise of heathen feasting , 01 or made their children
“pass through the fire” in sacrifice” even some of the kings, like
Solomon and Ahab, went “a - whoring” afte r foreign gods. Holy men like
Elijah and Elisha arose who, without necessarily becoming priests,
preached against these practices, and tried by the example of their
lives to lead their people into righteousness. Out of these conditions
and beginnings, and out of the rise of poverty and exploitation in
Israel, came the supreme figures in Jewish religion — those passionate
Prophets who purified and elevated</p>

<p>plete, after twenty years of industry, a proletariat had been created
in Jerusalem which, lacking sufficient employment, became a source of
political faction and corruption in Palestine, precisely as it was to
become in Rome. Slums developed step by step with the rise of private
wealth and the increasing luxury of the court. Exploitation and usury
became recognized practises among the owners of great estates and the
merchants and money-lenders who flocked about the Temple. The landlords
of Ephraim, said Amos, “sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a
pair of shoes .” 93</p>
<p>This growing gap between the needy and the affluent, and the sharpen-
ing of that conflict between the city and the country which always</p>
<p>accompanies an industrial civilization, had something to do with the
division of Palestine into two hostile kingdoms after the death of Solo-
mon: a northern kingdom of Ephraim,* with its capital at Samaria, and a
southern kingdom of Judah, with its capital at Jerusalem. From that time
on the Jews were weakened by fraternal hatred and strife, breaking out
occasionally into bitter war. Shortly after the death of Solomon</p>
<p>Jerusalem was captured by Sheshonk, Pharaoh of Egypt, and
surrendered, to appease the conqueror, nearly all the gold that Solomon
had gathered in his long career of taxation.</p>
<p>It was in this atmosphere of political disruption, economic war,
and</p>
<p>religious degeneration that the Prophets appeared. The men to whom
the word (in Hebrew, Nabi f) was first applied were not quite of the
character that our reverence would associate with Amos and Isaiah. Some
were diviners who could read the secrets of the heart and the past, and
foretell the future, according to remuneration; some were fanatics who
worked themselves into a frenzy by weird music, strong drink, or
dervish-like dances, and spoke, in trances, words which their hearers
considered inspired — i.e., breathed into them by some spirit other than
their own . 94 Jeremiah speaks with professional scorn of “every man
that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet .” 95 Some were gloomy
recluses, like Elijah; many of them lived in schools or monasteries near
the temples; but most of them had private property and wives.” From this
motley crowd of fakirs the Prophets developed into responsible and
consistent critics of their age and their people, magnificent
street-comer statesmen</p>

- promising of anti- Semites ,” 88 a cross between soothsayers and
socialists. We misunderstand them if we take them as prophets in the
weather sense; their predictions were hopes or threats, or pious
interpolations,™ or prognostications after the event ; 180 the Prophets
themselves did not pretend to foretell, so much as to speak out; they
were eloquent members of the Opposition. In one phase they were
Tolstoians incensed at in- dustrial exploitation and ecclesiastical
chicanery; they came up from the simple countryside, and hurled
damnation at the corrupt wealth of the towns.</p>
<p>Amos described himself not as a prophet but as a simnle village</p>
<p>shepherd. Having left his herds to see Beth-El, he was horrified at
the unnatural complexity of the life which he discovered there, the
in-</p>
<p>equality of fortune, the bitterness of competition, the ruthlessness
of exploitation. So he “stood in the gate,” and lashed the
conscienceless rich and their luxuries:</p>
<p>Forasmuch, therefore, as your treading is upon the poor, and ye</p>
<p>take from him burdens of wheat; ye have built houses of hewn</p>
<p>stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant</p>
<p>vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. . . . Woe to them</p>
<p>that are at ease in Zion, . . . that lie upon beds of ivory, and</p>
<p>stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the
flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; that chant to</p>
<p>the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music,
like David; that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with</p>
<p>the chief ointments. . . .</p>
<p>I despise your feast-days (saith the Lord) ; . . . though ye offer
me</p>
<p>burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them. . .

<p>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs, for I will not
hear</p>
<p>the melody of thy viols. But let judgment run down as waters, and</p>
<p>righteousness as a mighty stream . 101</p>
<p>This is a new note in the world’s literature. It is true that Amo s
dulls the edge of his idealism by putting into the mouth of his god a
Mississippi of threats whose severity and accumulation make the reader
sympathize for a moment with the drinkers of wine and the listeners to
music. But here, for the first time in the literature of Asia, the
social conscience takes definite form, and pours into religion a content
that lifts it from ceremony</p>

<p>and flattery to a whip of morals and a call to nobility. With Amos
begins the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>One of his bitterest predictions seems to have been fulfilled
while</p>
<p>Amos was still alive. “Thus saith the Lord: As the shepherd taketh
out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall
the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner
of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch. . . . And the houses of ivory
shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end.” 102 * About the
same time another prophet threatened Samaria with destruction in one of
those myriads of vivid phrases which King James’s translators minted for
the currency of our speech out of the wealth of the Bible: “The calf of
Samaria,” said Hosea, “shall be broken into pieces; for they have sown
the wind, and they shall reap the whirlw ind.” 10 * In 733 the young
kingdom of Judah, threatened by Ephraim in alliance with Syria, appealed
to Assyria for help. Assyria came, took Damascus, subjected Syria, Tyre
and Palestine to tribute, made note of Jewish efforts to secure Egyptian
aid, invaded again, captured Samaria, indulged in unprintable diplomatic
excha’nges with the King of Judah, 105 failed to take Jerusalem, and
retired to Nineveh laden with booty and 200,000 Jewish captives doomed
to Assyrian</p>
<p>slavery. 100</p>
<p>It was during this siege of Jerusalem that the prophet Isaiah became
one of the great figures of Hebrew history.f Less provincial than Amos,
he thought in terms of enduring statesmanship. Convinced that little
Judah could not resist the imperial power of Assyria, even with the help
of distant Egypt — that broken staff which would pierce the hand that
should try to use it — he pled with King Ahaz, and then with King</p>
<p>Hezekiah, to remain neutral in the war between Assyria and Ephraim,
like Amos and Hosea he foresaw the fall of Samaria, 108 and the end of
the northern kingdom. When, however, the Assyrians besieged Jerusalem,
Isaiah counseled Hezekiah not to yield. The sudden withdrawal of</p>
<p>Sennacherib’s hosts seemed to justify him, and for a time his repute
was high with the King and the people. Always his advice was to deal
justly,</p>

<p>and then leave the issue to Yahveh, who would use Assyria as his
agent for a time, but in the end would destroy her, too. Indeed, all the
nations known to Isaiah were, according to him, destined to be struck
down by Yahveh; in a few chapters (xvi-xxiii) Moab, Syria, Ethiopia,
Egypt,</p>
<p>Babylon and Tyre are dedicated to destruction; “every one shall howl
.” 100 This ardor for ruination, this litany of curses, mars Isaiah’s
book, as it mars all the prophetic literature of the Bible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless his denunciation falls where it belongs — upon economic
exploitation and greed. Here his eloquence rises to the highest point
reached in the Old Testament, in passages that are among the peaks of
the world’s prose:</p>

<p>and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the</p>
<p>spoil of the poor is in your houses. What mean ye that ye beat my</p>
<p>people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? . . . Woe unto</p>
<p>them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be
no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! . .
.</p>
<p>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees to turn aside the</p>
<p>needy from judgment (justice), and to take away the right from</p>
<p>the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that</p>
<p>they may rob the fatherless. And what will ye do in the day of</p>
<p>visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from afar? to</p>
<p>whom will ye flee for help, and where will ye leave your glory ?

<p>He is filled with scorn of those who, while fleecing the poor,
present a pious face to the world.</p>
<p>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?</p>
<p>saith the Lord. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the</p>
<p>fat of fed beasts. . . . Your appointed feasts my soul hateth;
they</p>
<p>are a trouble unto me; I am weary to hear them. And when ye</p>
<p>spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when</p>
<p>ye make many prayers I will not hear; your hands are full of
blood.</p>
<p>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from</p>
<p>before mine eyes, cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek
judgment</p>

<p>restoration of the Jews to their native land,“ so Isaiah concludes
by</p>
<p>formulating the Messianic hope — the trust of the Jews in some
Redeemer who will end their political divisions, their subjection, and
their misery, and bring an era of universal brotherhood and peace:</p>
<p>Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call</p>
<p>his name Immanuel. . . . For unto us a child is born: and the
gov-</p>
<p>ernment shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called</p>
<p>Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father,</p>
<p>the Prince of Peace. . . . And there shall come forth a rod out</p>
<p>of the stem of Jesse. . . . And the spirit of the Lord shall rest</p>
<p>upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of</p>
<p>counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the</p>
<p>Lord. . . . With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and re-</p>
<p>prove with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite</p>
<p>the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his</p>
<p>lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the
girdle</p>
<p>of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The wolf
also</p>
<p>shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with
the</p>
<p>kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fading together; and</p>
<p>a little child shall lead them. . . . And they shall beat their
swords</p>
<p>into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any</p>
<p>more. 11 *</p>
<p>It was an admirable aspiration, but not for many generations yet
would ft express the mood of the Jews. The priests of the Temple
listened</p>
<p>with a well-controlled sympathy to these useful encouragements to
piety; certain sects looked back to the Prophets for part of their
inspiration; and perhaps these excoriations of all sensual delight had
some share in intensi- fying the desert-born Puritanism of the Jews. But
for the most part the old life of the palace and the tent, the
market-place and the field, went on as before; war took its choice of
every generation, and slavery con- tinued to be the lot of the alien;
the merchant cheated with his scales, 11 * and tried to atone with
sacrifice and prayer.</p>
<p>It was upon the Judaism of post-Exilic days, and upon the world</p>
<p>through Judaism and Christianity, that the Prophets left their
deepest mark. In Amos and Isaiah is the beginning of both Christianity
and</p>
<p>socialism, the spring from which has flowed a stream of Utopias
wherein</p>
<p>320 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>no poverty or war shall disturb human brotherhood and peace; they are
the source of the early Jewish conception of a Messiah who would seize
the government, reestablish the temporal power of the Jews, and inaug-
urate a dictatorship of the dispossessed among mankind. Isaiah and- Amos
began, in a military age, the exaltation of those virtues of simplicity
and gentleness, of cooperation and friendliness, which Jesus was to make
a vital element in his creed. They were the first to undertake the heavy
task of reforming the God of Hosts into a God of Love; they conscripted
Yahveh for humanitarianism as the radicals of the nineteenth century
conscripted Christ for socialism. It was they who, when the Bible was
printed in Europe, fired the Germanic mind with a rejuvenated Chris-
tianity, and lighted the torch of the Reformation; it was their fierce
and intolerant virtue that formed the Puritans. Their moral philosophy
was based upon a theory that would bear better documentation — that the
righteous man will prosper, and the wicked will be struck down; but even
if that should be a delusion it is the failing of a noble mind. The
prophets had no conception of freedom, but they loved justice, and
called for an end to the tribal limitations of morality. They offered to
the unfortunate of the earth a vision of brotherhood that became the
precious and unforgotten heritage of many generations.</p>
<p>V. THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF JERUSALEM</p>
<p>The birth of the Bible — The destruction of Jerusalem — The Baby-</p>
<p>lonian Captivity — Jeremiah — Ezekiel — The Second Isaiah —</p>
<p>The liberation of the Jews — The Second Temple</p>
<p>Their greatest contemporary influence was on the writing of the
Bible. As the people fell away from the worship of Yahveh to the
adoration of alien gods, the priests began to wonder whether the time
had not come to make a final stand against the disintegration of the
national faith. Taking a leaf from the Prophets, who attributed to
Yahveh the passionate convictions of their own souls, they resolved to
issue to the people a com- munication from God himself, a code of laws
that would reinvigorate the moral life of the nation, and would at the
same time attract the</p>
<p>support of the Prophets by embodying the less extreme of their ideas.
They readily won King Josiah to their plan; and about the eighteenth
year of his reign the priest Hilkiah announced to the King that he had
“found” in the secret archives of the Temple an astonishing scroll
in</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>3*1</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>which the great Moses himself, at the direct dictation of Yahveh, had
settled once for all those problems of history and conduct that were
being so hotly debated by prophets and priests. The discovery made a
great stir. Josiah called the elders of Judah to the Temple, and there
read to them the “Book of the Covenant” in the presence (we are told) of
thousands of people. Then he solemnly swore that he would henceforth
abide by the laws of this book; and “he caused all that were present to
stand to it.”” 8</p>
<p>We do not know just what this “Book of the Covenant” was; it may</p>
<p>have been Exodus xx- xxiii, or it may have been Deuteronomy.” 8 We
need not suppose that it had been invented on the spur of the situation;
it merely formulated, and put into writing, decrees, demands and
exhorta- tions which for centuries had emanated from the prophets and
the Temple. In any event, those who heard the reading, and even those
who only heard of it, were deeply impressed. Josiah took advantage of
this mood to raid the altars of Yahveh’s rivals in Judah; he cast “out
of th e temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal,” he
put down the</p>
<p>idolatrous priests, and “them also that burned incense unto Baal, to
the</p>
<p>These reforms did not seem to propitiate Yahveh, or bring him to the
aid of his people. Nineveh fell as the Prophets had foretold, but only
to leave little Judah subject first to Egypt and then to Babylon. When
Pharaoh Necho, bound for Syria, tried to pass through Palestine, Josiah,
relying upon Yahveh, resisted him on the ancient battle-site of Megiddo
— only to be defeated and slain. A few years later Nebuchadrezzar over-
whelmed Necho at Carchemish, and made Judah a Babylonian depend- ency.
Josiah’s successors sought by secret diplomacy to liberate them - selves
from the clutch of Babylon, and thought to bring Egypt to their rescue;
but the fiery Nebuchadrezzar, getting wind of it, poured his</p>
<p>soldiery into Palestine, captured Jerusalem, took King Jehoiakim
prisoner, put Zedekiah on the throne of Judah, and carried 10,000 Jews
into bond- age. But Zedekiah, too, loved liberty, or power, and rebelled
against Babylon. Thereupon Nebuchadrezzar returned, and — resolving to
settle the Jewish problem once and for all, as he thought — recaptured
Jerusalem, burned it to the ground, destroyed the Temple of Solomon,
slew Zede-</p>
<p>322 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>kiah’s sons before his face, gouged out his eyes, and carried
practically all the population of the city into captivity in Babylonia
.* 8 Later a Jewish poet sang one of the world’s great songs about that
unhappy caravan:</p>
<p>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when</p>
<p>we remembered Zion.</p>
<p>We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
song;</p>
<p>and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one</p>
<p>of the songs of Zion.</p>
<p>How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?</p>
<p>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning.</p>
<p>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my</p>
<p>mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy . 110</p>
<p>In all this crisis the bitterest and most eloquent of the Prophets
defended Babylon as a scourge in the hands of God, denounced the rulers
of Judah as obstinate fools, and advised such complete surrender to
Nebuchadrezzar that the modem reader is tempted to wonder could Jeremiah
have been a paid agent of Babylonia. “I have made the earth, the man and
the</p>
<p>beast that are upon the ground,” says Jeremiah’s God, . . . “and now
hav e I given all those lands into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar, the King
of</p>
<p>Babylon, my servant. . . . And all nations shall serve him. And it
shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve
the</p>
<p>same Nebuchadrezzar, the King of Babylon, and that will not put their
neck under the yoke of the King of Babylon, that nation will I punish,
saith the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pesti-
lence, until I have consumed them by his hand.” 1 ”</p>
<p>He may have been a traitor, but the book of his prophecies,
supposedly taken down by his disciple Baruch, is not only one of the
most passion- ately eloquent writings in all literature, as rich in
vivid imagery as in</p>
<p>merciless abuse, but it is marked with a sincerity that begins as a
diffident self-questioning, and ends with honest doubts about his own
course and all human life. “Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne
me, a man of strife, and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have
neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one
of them doth curse me. . . . Cursed be the day wherein I was born.” m A
flame of in - dignation burned in him at the sight of moral depravity
and political folly in his people and its leaders; he felt inwardly
compelled to stand in the</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>gate and call Israel to repentance. All this national decay, all this
weak- ening of the state, this obviously imminent subjection of Judah to
Babylon, were, it seemed to Jeremiah, Yahveh’s hand laid upon the Jews
in punish- ment for their sins. “Run ye to and fro through the streets
of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places
thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment,
that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it .” 122 Everywhere iniquity
ruled, and sex ran riot; men “were as fed horses in the morning; every
one neighed after his neighbor’s wife .” 122 When the Babylonians
besieged Jerusalem the rich men of the city, to propitiate Yahveh,
released their Hebrew slaves; but when for a time the siege was raised,
and the danger seemed past, the rich apprehended their former slaves,
and forced them into their old bondage: it was a summary of human
history that Jeremiah could not bear silently . 121 Like the other
Prophets, he denounced those hypocrites who with pious faces brought to
the Temple some part of the gains they had made from grinding the faces
of the poor; the Lord, he reminded them, in the eternal lesson of all
finer religion, asked not for sacrifice but for justice . 126 The
priests and the prophets, he thinks, are almost as false and corrupt as
the merchants; they, too, like the people, need to be morally reborn, to
be (in Jeremiah’s strange phrase) circumcised in the spirit as well as
in the flesh. “Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take</p>
<p>Against these abuses the Prophet preached with a fury rivaled
only</p>
<p>by the stern saints of Geneva, Scotland and England. Jeremiah cursed
the Jews savagely, and took some delight in picturing the ruin of all
who would not heed him . 127 Time and again he predicted the destruction
of Jerusalem and the captivity in Babylon, and wept over the doomed city
(whom he called the daughter of Zion) in terms anticipatory of</p>
<p>Christ: “Oh, that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of
my people !” 128</p>
<p>To the “princes” of Zedekiah’s court all this seemed sheer
treason;</p>
<p>it was dividing the Jews in counsel and spirit in the very hour of
war. Jeremiah tantalized them by carrying a wooden yoke around his neck,
ex- plaining that all Judah must submit — the more peaceably the better
— to the yoke of Babylon; and when Hananiah tore this yoke away Jeremiah
cried out that Yahveh would make yokes of iron for all the Jews. The
priests tried to stop him by putting his head into the stocks; but
from</p>

<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>even that position he continued to denounce them. They arraigned him
in the Temple, and wished to kill him, but through some friend among the
priests he escaped. Then the princes arrested him, and lowered him by
ropes into a dungeon filled with mire; but Zedekiah had him raised to
milder imprisonment in the palace court. There the Babylonians found him
when Jerusalem fell. On Nebuchadrezzar’s orders they treated him well,
and exempted him from the general exile. In his old age, says ortho- dox
tradition , 12811 he wrote his “Lamentations,” the most eloquent of all
the books of the Old Testament. He mourned now the completeness of his
triumph and the desolation of Jerusalem, and raised to heaven the un-
answerable questions of Job:</p>
<p>How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how she
is</p>
<p>become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and</p>
<p>princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary! . . .</p>
<p>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if
there</p>
<p>be any sorrow like unto my sorrow. . . . Righteous art thou, O</p>
<p>Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let us talk with thee of thy</p>
<p>judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?</p>
<p>Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?™</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Babylon, another preacher was taking up the burden of
prophecy. Ezekiel belonged to a priestly family that had been driven to
Babylon in the first deportation from Jerusalem. He began his preach-
ing, like the First Isaiah and Jeremiah, with fierce denunciations of
idol- atry and corruption in Jerusalem. At great length he compared
Jerusa- lem to a harlot, because she sold the favors of her worship to
strange gods; 1 ” he described Samaria and Jerusalem as twin whores;
this word was as popular with him as with the dramatists of the Stuart
Restoration. He made long lists of the sins of Jerusalem, and then
condemned her to cap- ture and destruction. Like Isaiah, he doomed the
nations impartially, and announced the sins and fall of Moab, Tyre,
Egypt, Assyria, even of the mysterious kingdom of Magog . 181 But he was
not as bitter as Jeremiah; in the end he relented, declared that the
Lord would save “a remnant” of the</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>3*5</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>He hoped, with this happy ending, to keep up the spirits of the
exiles, and to retard their assimilation into the Babylonian culture and
blood. Then as now it seemed that this process of absorption would
destroy the unity, even the identity, of the Jews. They flourished on
Mesopotamia’s rich soil, they enjoyed considerable freedom of custom and
worship, they grew rapidly in numbers and wealth, and prospered in the
unwonted tranquillity and harmony which their subjection had brought to
them. An ever-rising proportion of them accepted the gods of Babylon,
and the epicurean ways of the old metropolis. When the second generation
of exiles grew up, Jerusalem was almost forgotten.</p>
<p>It was the function of the unknown author who undertook to complete
the Book of Isaiah to restate the religion of Israel for this
backsliding gen- eration; and it was his distinction, in restating it,
to lift it to the loftiest plane that any religion had yet reached amid
all the faiths of the Near East.* While Buddha in India was preaching
the death of desire, and Confucius in China was formulating wisdom for
his pe ople, this “Sec - ond Isaiah,” in majestic and luminous prose,
announced to the exiled Jews the first clear revelation of monotheism,
and offered them a new god, in- finitely richer in “lovingkindness” and
tender mercy than the bitter Yah - veh even of the First Isaiah. In
words that a later gospel was to choose as spurring on the young Christ,
this greatest of Prophets announced his mission — no longer to curse the
people for their sins, but to bring them hope in their bondage. “The
Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to
preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
the prison to them that are bound.” 1 *’ For he has dis - covered that
Yahveh is not a god of war and vengeance, but a loving father; the
discovery fills him with happiness, and inspires him to mag- nificent
songs. He predicts the coming of the new god to rescue his</p>
<p>people:</p>
<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the</p>
<p>way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our</p>
<p>God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill</p>
<ul>
<li>We know nothing of the history of this writer, who, by a literary
device and license common to his time, chose to speak in the name of
Isaiah. We merely guess that he wrote shortly before or after Cyrus
liberated the Jews. Biblical scholarship assigns to him chapters xl-lv,
and to another and later unknown, or unknowns, chapters lvi-lxvi . 182 *

<p>strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him. . . . He shall feed</p>
<p>his flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his
arm,</p>
<p>and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are</p>
<p>with young.</p>
<p>The prophet then lifts the Messianic hope to a place arpong the
ruling ideas of his people, and describes the “Servant” who will redeem
Israel by vicarious sacrifice:</p>
<p>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and ac-</p>
<p>quainted with grief; … he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
<p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we</p>
<p>did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he
was</p>
<p>wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities;</p>
<p>the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes</p>
<p>we are healed. . . . The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us</p>
<p>all.t 134</p>
<p>Persia, the Second Isaiah predicts, will be the instrument of this
lib-</p>
<p>eration. Cyrus is invincible; he will take Babylon, and will free the
Jews from their captivity. They will return to Jerusalem and build a
new</p>
<p>Temple, a new city, a very paradise: “the wolf and the lamb shall
feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like a bullock; and dust
shall be the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my
holy mountain, saith the Lord .” 135 Perhaps it was the rise of Persi a,
and the spread of its power, subjecting all the states of the Near East
in an imperial unity vaster and better governed than any social
organization men had yet known, that suggested to the Prophet the
conception of one universal deity. No longer do es his god say, like the
Yahveh of Moses, “I am the Lord thy God; . . . thou shalt not have
strange gods before me”; now it is written: “I am the Lord, and there is
none else, there is no god besides me .” 130 The prophet -poet describes
this universal deity in one of the great passages of the Bible:</p>
<p>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and</p>
<p>meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of</p>

<p>the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and</p>
<p>the hills in a balance? Behold, the nations are as a drop of a
bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold, he
taketh up the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are
as</p>
<p>nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing, and
vanity.</p>
<p>To whom, then, will ye liken God, or what likeness will ye com-</p>
<p>pare with him? It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
and</p>
<p>the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.</p>
<p>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these</p>
<p>things . 137</p>
<p>It was a dramatic hour in the history of Israel when at last Cyrus
entered Babylon as a world-conqueror, and gave to the exiled Jews full
freedom to return to Jerusalem. He disappointed some of the Prophets,
and</p>
<p>showed his superior civilization, by leaving Babylon and its
population unhurt, and offering a sceptical obeisance to its gods. He
restored to the Jews what remained in the Babylonian treasury of the
gold and silver taken by Nebuchadrezzar from the Temple, and instructed
the communi- ties in which the exiles lived to furnish them with funds
for their long journey home. The younger Jews were not enthusiastic at
this libera- tion; many of them had sunk strong roots into Babylonian
soil, and</p>
<p>hesitated to abandon their fertile fields and their flourishing trade
for the desolate ruins of the Holy City. It was not until two years
after Cyrus’ coming that the first detachment of zealots set out on the
long three months’ journey back to the land which their fathers had left
half a</p>
<p>century before . 138</p>
<p>They found themselves, then as now, not entirely welcome in their</p>
<p>ancient home. For meanwhile other Semites had settled there, and had
made the soil their own by occupation and toil; and these tribes looked
with hatred upon the apparent invaders of what seemed to them their
native fields. The returning Jews could not possibly have established
them- selves had it not been for the strong and friendly empire that
protected them. The prince Zerubbabel won permission from the Persian
king, Darius I, to rebuild the Temple; and though the immigrants were
small in number and resources, and the work was hindered at every step
by the attacks and conspiracies of a hostile population, it was carried
to com- pletion within some twenty-two years after the return. Slowly
Jerusalem became again a Jewish city, and the Temple resounded with the
psalms of</p>

<p>To build a military state was impossible, Judea had neither the num-
bers nor the wealth for such an enterprise. Since some system of order
was needed that, while recognizing the sovereignty of Persia, would give
the Jews a natural discipline and a national unity, the clergy undertook
to provide a theocratic rule based, like Josiah’s, on priestly
traditions and laws promulgated as divine commands. About the year 444
b.c. Ezra, a learned priest, called the Jews together in solemn
assembly, and read to them, from mom to midday, the “Book of the Law of
Moses.” For seven days he and his fellow Levites read from these
scrolls; at the end the priests and the leaders of the people pledged
themselves to accept this body of legislation as their constitution and
their conscience, and to obey it forever. 1 ” From those troubled times
till ours that Law has been the central fact in the life of the Jews;
and their loyalty to it through all wanderings and tribulations has been
one of the impressive phenomena of history.</p>
<p>What was this “Book of the Law of Moses”? Not quite the same as</p>
<p>that “Book of the Covenant” which Josiah had read; for the latter had
admitted of being completely read twice in a day, while the other needed
a week. 1 “ We can only guess that the larger scroll constituted a
substan- tial part of those first five books of the Old Testament which
the Jews call Torah or the Law, and which others call the Pentateuch. 1
“* How, when, and where had these books been written? This is an
innocent ques- tion which has caused the writing of fifty thousand
volumes, and must here be left unanswered in a paragraph.</p>
<p>The consensus of scholarship is that the oldest elements in the Bible

<p>“E” respectively because one speaks of the Creator as Jehovah
(Yahveh), while the other speaks of him as Elohim. # It is believed that
the Yahvist narrative was written in Judah, the Elohist in Ephraim, and
that the two stories fused into one after the fall of Samaria. A third
element, known as “D,” and embodying the Deuteronomic Code, is probably
by a distinct au - thor or group of authors. A fourth element, “P,” is
composed of sections later inserted by the priests; this “Priestly Code”
is probably the substance of the “Book of the Law” promulgated by Ezra .
142a The four compositions appear to have taken their present form about
300 b.c . 148</p>
<p>These delightful tales of the Creation, the Temptation and the Flood
were drawn from a storehouse of Mesopotamian legend as old as 3000 b.c.;
we have seen some early forms of them in the course of this history. It
is possible that the Jews appropriated some of these myths from
Babylonian literature during the Captivity; 144 it is more likely that
they had adopted them long before, from ancient Semitic and Sumerian
sources common to all the Near East. The Persian and the Talmudic forms
of the Creation myth represent God as first making a two-sexed being — a
male and a female joined at the back like Siamese twins — and then
dividing it as an after- thought. We are reminded of a strange sentence
in Genesis (v, 2): “Male and female created he them, and blessed them,
and called their name Adam”: i.e., our first parent was originally both
male and female — which seems to have escaped all theologians except
Aristophanes.t</p>
<p>The legend of Paradise appears in almost all folklore — in Egypt,
India, Tibet, Babylonia, Persia, Greece, £ Polynesia, Mexico, etc. 146
Most of these Edens had forbidden trees, and were supplied with serpents
or dragons that stole immortality from men, or otherwise poisoned
Paradise. 147 Both the serpent and the fig .were probably phallic
symbols; behind the myth is the thought that sex and knowledge destroy
innocence and happiness, and are the origin of evil; we shall find this
same idea at the end of the Old Testa- ment in Ecclesiastes as here at
the beginning. In most of these stories</p>

<p>woman was the lovely-evil agent of the serpent or the devil, whether
as Eve, or Pandora, or the Poo See of Chinese legend. “All things,” says
the Shi- ching, “were at first subject to man, but a woman threw us
into</p>
<p>slavery. Our misery came not from heaven but from woman; she lost the
human race. Ah, unhappy Poo See! Thou kindled the fire that consumes us,
and which is every day increasing. . . . The world is lost. Vice over-
flows all things.”</p>
<p>Even more universal was the story of the Flood; hardly an ancient
people went without it, and hardly a mountain in Asia but had given
perch to some water-wearied Noah or Shamash-napishtim . 148 Usually
these legends were the popular vehicle or allegory of a philosophical
judgment or a moral attitude summarizing long racial experience — that
sex and knowledge bring more grief than joy, and that human life is
periodically threatened by floods, — i.e., ruinous inundations of the
great rivers whose waters made possible the earliest known
civilizations. To ask whether these stories are true or false, whether
they “really happened,” would be to put a trivial and superficial
question; their substance, of course, is not the tales they tell but the
judgments they convey. Meanwhile it would be unwise not to enjoy their
disarming sim- plicity, and the vivid swiftness of their narratives.</p>
<p>The books which Josiah and Ezra caused to be read to the people</p>
<p>formulated that “Mosaic” Code on which all later Jewish life was to
be built. Of this legislation the cautious Sarton writes: “Its
importance in the history of institutions and of law cannot be
overestimated .” 149 It was the most thoroughgoing attempt in history to
use religion as a basis of statesmanship, and as a regulator of every
detail of life; the Law became, says Renan, “the tightest garment into
which life was ever laced.” 1 “ Diet,* medicine, personal, menstrual and
natal hygiene, public sanitation, sexual inversion and bestiality 182 —
all are made subjects of divine ordinance and guidance; again we observe
how slowly the doctor was differentiated from the priest 1 “ — to become
in time his greatest enemy. Leviticus (xiii- xv) legislates; carefully
for the treatment of venereal disease, even to the most definite
directions for segregation, disinfection, fumigation and, if necessary,
the complete burning of the house in which the disease has run # Cf.
Deut. xiv. Reinach, Roberston Smith and Sir James Frazer have attributed
the avoidance of pork not to hygienic knowledge and precaution but to
the totemic worship of the pig (or wild boar) by the ancestors of the
Jews . 161 The “worship” of the wild boar, however, may have been merely
a priestly means of making it tabu in the sense of “unclean.” The great
number of wise hygienic rules in the Mosaic Code warrant a humble
scepticism of Reinach’s interpretation.</p>

<p>its course. 154 * “The ancient Hebrews were the founders of prophy -
laxis ,” 160 but they seem to have had no surgery beyond circumcision.
This rite — common among ancient Egyptians and modern Semites — was not
only a sacrifice to God and a compulsion to racial loyalty, f it was
a</p>
<p>hygienic precaution against sexual uncleanliness . 158 Perhaps it was
this Code of Cleanliness that helped to preserve the Jews through their
long Odyssey of dispersion and suffering.</p>
<p>For the rest the Code centered about those Ten Commandments (Exodus,
xx, 1- 1 7) which were destined to receive the lip-service of half the
world.t The first laid the foundation of the new theocratic community,
which was to rest not upon any civil law, but upon the idea of God; he
was the Invisible King who dictated every law and meted out every
penalty; and his people were to be called Israel , as meaning the
Defenders of God. The Hebrew state was dead, but the Temple remained;
the priests of Judea, like the Popes of Rome, would try to restore what
the kings had failed to save. Hence the explicitness and reiteration of
the First Commandment: heresy or blasphemy must be punished with death,
even if the heretic should be one’s closest kin. 101 The priestly
authors of the Code, like the pious Inquisitors, believed that re-
ligious unity was an indispensable condition of social organization and
soli- darity. It was this intolerance, and their racial pride, that
embroiled and preserved the Jews.</p>
<p>The Second Commandment elevated the national conception of God at the
expense of art: no graven images were ever to be made of him. It as-
sumed a high intellectual level among the Jews, for it rejected
superstition</p>
<ul>
<li>The procedure recommended by Leviticus (xiii-xiv) in cases of
leprosy was practised in Europe to the end of the Middle Ages. 156</li>

<p>fBy making race ultimately unconcealable. “The Jewish rite,” says
Briffault, “did not assume its present form until so late a period as
that of the Maccabees (167 b.c.). At that date it was still performed in
such a manner that the jibes of Gentile women could be evaded, little
trace of the operation being perceptible. The nationalistic priesthood
there- fore enacted that the prepuce should be completely removed.”
157</p>
<p>Jit was the usual thing for ancient law-codes to be of divine origin.
We have seen how the laws of Egypt were given it by the god Thoth, and
how the sun-god Shamash begot Hammurabi’s code. In like manner a deity
gave to King Minos on Mt. Dicta the laws that were to govern Crete; the
Greeks represented Dionysus, whom they also called “The Lawgiver,” with
two tables of stone on which laws were inscribed; and the pious Persians
tell how, one day, as Zoroaster prayed on a high mountain, Ahura-Mazda
ap- peared to him amid thunder and lightning, and delivered to him “The
Book of the Law.” 160 “They did all this,” says Diodorus, “because the y
believed that a conception which would help humanity was marvelous and
wholly divine; or because they held that the common crowd would be more
likely to obey the laws if their gaze were directed towards the majesty
and power of those to whom their law s were ascribed.” 100</p>
<p>33 2 THE story of civilization (chap. XII</p>
<p>and anthropomorphism, and-despite the all-too-human quality of the
Penta- teuch Yahveh — tried to conceive of God as beyond every form and
image. It conscripted Hebrew devotion for religion, and left nothing, in
ancient days, for science and art; even astronomy was neglected, lest
corrupt diviners should multiply, or the stars be worshiped as
divinities. In Solomon’s Temple there had been an almost heathen
abundance of imagery ; 163 in the new Temple there was none. The old
images had been carried off to Babylon, and ap- parently had not been
returned along with utensils of silver and gold . 104 Hence we find no
sculpture, painting or bas-relief after the Captivity, and very little
before it except under the almost alien Solomon; architecture and music
were the only arts that the priests would allow. Song and Temple ritual
redeemed the life of the people from gloom; an orchestra of several
instruments joined “as one to make one sound” with a great choir of
voices to sing the psalms that glorified the Temple and its God . 165
“David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on harps,
psalteries, timbrels, comets and cymbals .” 186</p>
<p>The Third Commandment typified the intense piety of the Jew. Not only
would he not “take the name of the Lord God in vain”; he would never pro
- nounce it; even when he came upon the name of Yahveh in his prayers he
would substitute for it Adonai — Lord.* Only the Hindus would rival this
piety.</p>
<p>The Fourth Commandment sanctified the weekly day of rest as a
Sabbath, and passed it down as one of the strongest institutions of
mankind. The name, — and perhaps the custom — came from Babylon;
shabattu was applied by the Babylonians to “tabu” day s of abstinence
and propitiation . 168 Besides this week- ly holyday there were great
festivals — once Canaanite vegetation rites remi- niscent of sowing and
harvesting, and the cycles of moon and sun: Mazzoth originally
celebrated the beginning of the barley harvest; Shabuoth, later called
Pentecost , celebrated the end of the wheat harvest; Sukkoth com-
memorated the vintage; Pesach, or Passover, was the feast of the first
fruits of the flock; Rosh-ha-shanah announced the New Year; only later
were these festivals adapted to commemorate vital events in the history
of the Jews. 168a On the first day of the Passover a lamb or kid was
sacrificed and eaten, and its blood was sprinkled upon the doors as the
portion of the god; later the priests attached this custom to the story
of Yahveh’s slaughter of the first - born of the Egyptians. The lamb was
once a totem of a Canaanite clan; the</p>

translated into Jehovah because the vowels a-o-a had been placed over

Reformation wrongly supposed that these vowels were to be placed between
the consonants of Jhvh.™</li>

<p>Passover, among the Canaanites, was the oblation of a lamb to the
local god.* As we read (Exod., xi) the story of the establishment of the
Passover rite, and see the Jews celebrating that same rite steadfastly
today, we feel again the venerable antiquity of their worship, and the
strength and tenacity of their race.</p>
<p>The Fifth Commandment sanctified the family, as second only to the
Temple in the structure of Jewish society; the ideals then stamped upon
the institution marked it throughout medieval and modern European
history until our own disintegrative Industrial Revolution. The Hebrew
patriarchal family was a vast economic and political organization, com-
posed of the oldest married male, his wives, his unmarried children, his
married sons with their wives and children, and perhaps some slaves. The
economic basis of the institution was its convenience for cultivating
the soil; its political value lay in its providing a system of social
order so strong that it made the state — except in war — almost
superfluous. The father’s authority was practically unlimited; the land
was his, and his chil - dren could survive only by obedience to him; he
was the state. If he was poor he could sell his daughter, before her
puberty, as a bondservant; and though occasionally he condescended to
ask her consent, he had full right to dispose of her in marriage as he
wished . 190 Boys were supposed to be products of the right testicle,
girls of the left — which was believed to be smaller and weaker than the
right . 170 At first marriage was matrilocal; the man had to “leave his
father and mother and cleave to his wife” in her clan; but this custom
gradually died out after the establishment of the monarchy. Yahveh’s
instructions to the wife were: “Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and
he shall rule over thee.” Though technically sub - ject, the woman was
often a person of high authority and dignity; the history of the Jews
shines with such names as Sarah, Rachel, Miriam and Esther; Deborah was
one of the judges of Israel , 172 and it was the prophet- ess Huldah
whom Josiah consulted about the Book which the priests had found in the
Temple . 173 The mother of many children was certain of security and
honor. For the little nation longed to increase and multiply, feeling,
as in Palestine today, its dangerous numerical inferiority to the
peoples surrounding it; therefore it exalted motherhood, branded
celibacy as a sin and a crime, made marriage compulsory after twenty,

<p>priests, abhorred marriageable virgins and childless women, and
looked upon abortion, infanticide and other means of limiting population
as heathen abominations that stank in the nostrils of the Lord . 174
“And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her
sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die .” 175 The
perfect wife was one who labored constantly in and about her home, and
had no thought except in her husband and her children. The last chapter
of Proverbs states the male ideal of woman completely:</p>
<p>Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above</p>
<p>rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that
he</p>
<p>shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil
all</p>
<p>the days of her life. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh
will-</p>
<p>ingly with her hands. She is like the merchants’ ships; she
bringeth</p>
<p>her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and
giveth</p>
<p>meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. She consider- ed
a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planted a</p>
<p>vineyard. She girded her loins with strength, and strengtheneth
her</p>
<p>arms. She perceived that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth
not out by night. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands
hold the distaff. She stretched out her hand to the poor; yea, she</p>
<p>reached forth her hands to the needy. . . . She maketh herself cover-
ings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is</p>
<p>known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p>She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto
the merchant. Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall re-</p>
<p>joice in time to come. She opened her mouth with wisdom, and in</p>
<p>her tongue is the law of kindness. She looked well to the ways of</p>
<p>her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children</p>

<p>335</p>
<p>tween slaughter and compensatory reproduction. Tribal quarrels,
internal factions and hereditary vendettas broke the monotony of
intermittent peace. 1 ” Despite a magnificent verse about ploughshares
and pruning - hooks, the Prophets were not pacifists, and the priests —
if we may judge from the speeches which they put into the mouth of
Yahveh — were almost as fond of war as of preaching. Among nineteen
kings of Israel eight were assassinated. 1 ” Captured cities we re
usually destroyed, the males put to the sword, and the soil deliberately
ruined — in the fashion of the times. 1 ” Perhaps the figures exaggerate
the killing; it is unbelievable that, entirely without modem inventions,
“the children of Israel slew of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen
in one day.” 1 ” Belief in themselves as the chosen people 1 “
intensified the pride natural in a nation conscious of superior
abilities; it accentuated their disposition to segregate themselves
maritally and mentally from other peoples, and deprived them of the in-
ternational perspective that their descendants were to attain. But they
had in high degree the virtues of their qualities. Their violence came
of unmanageable vitality, their separatism came of their piety, their
quarrel- someness and querulousness came of a passionate sensitivity
that produced the greatest literature of the Near East; their racial
pride was the indis- pensable prop of their courage through centuries of
suffering. Men are what they have had to be.</p>
<p>The Seventh Commandment recognized marriage as the basis of the
family, as the Fifth had recognized the family as the basis of society;
and it offered to marriage all the support of religion. It said nothing
about sex relations before marriage, but other regulations laid upon the
bride the obligation, under pain of death by stoning, to prove her
virginity on the day of her marriage .” 1 Nevertheless prostitution was
common and ped - erasty apparently survived the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah. 1 “ As the Law did not seem to prohibit relations with foreign
harlots, Syrian, Moabite, Midianite and other “strange women” flourished
along the high - ways, where they lived in booths and tents, and
combined the trades of peddler and prostitute. Solomon, who had no
violent prejudices in these matters, relaxed the laws that had kept such
women out of Jerusalem; in time they multiplied so rapidly there that in
the days of the Maccabees the Temple itself was described by an
indignant reformer as full of forni- cation and harlotry. 1 “</p>
<p>Love affairs probably occurred, for there was much tenderness
between</p>
<p>336 the story of civilization (chap.xii</p>
<p>the sexes; “Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed unto
him but a few days for the love he had to her .” 184 But love played a
very small role in the choice of mates. Before the Exile marriage was
com- pletely secular, arranged by the parents, or by the suitor with the
parents of the bride. Vestiges of capture-marriage are found in the Old
Testa- ment; Yahveh approves of it in war ; 185 and the elders, on the
occasion of a shortage of women, “commanded the children of Benjamin,
saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; and see and behold if the
daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances; then come ye out of the
vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,
and go to the land of Benjamin .” 188 But this was exceptional; usually
the marriage was by purchase; Jacob purchased Leah and Rachel by his
toil, the gentle Ruth was quite simply bought by Boaz, and the prophet
Hosea regretted exceedingly that he had given fifty shekels for his wife
. 187 The word for wife, beulah, meant owned . 1873 The father of the
bride reciprocated by giving his daughter a dowry — an institution
admirably adapted to diminish the socially disruptive gap between the
sexual and the economic matur- ity of children in an urban
civilization.</p>
<p>If the man was well-to-do, he might practise polygamy; if the
wife</p>
<p>was barren, like Sarah, she might encourage her husband to take a
con- cubine. The purpose of these arrangements was prolific
reproduction; it was taken as a matter of course that after Rachel and
Leah had given Jacob all the children they were capable of bearing, they
should offer him their maids, who would also bear him children . 188 A
woman was not allowed to remain idle in this matter of reproduction; if
a husband died, his brother, however many wives he might already have,
was obliged to marry her; or, if the husband had no brother, the
obligation fell upon his nearest surviving male kin. 18 “ Since private
property was the core of Jewish economy, the double standard prevailed:
the man might have many wives, but the woman was confined to one man.
Adultery meant relations with a woman who had been bought and paid for
by another man; it was a violation of the law of property, and was
punished with death for both parties . 1 “ 8 Fornication was forbidden
to women, but was looked upon as a venial offense in men . 1 “ 1 Divorce
was free to the man, but extremely difficult for the woman, until
Talmudic days .“ 3 The husband does not seem to have abused his
privileges unduly; he is pictured to us, all in all, as zealously
devoted to his wife and his children. And though</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>love did not determine marriage, it often flowered out of it. “Isaac
took Rebecca, and she became his wife; and he loved her; and Isaac was
com- forted after his mother’s death .” 194 Probably i n no other people
outside of the Far East has family life reached so high a level as among
the Jews.</p>
<p>The Eighth Commandment sanctified private property,* and bound it up
with religion and the family as one of the three bases of Hebrew
society. Property was almost entirely in land; until the days of Solomon
there was little industry beyond that of the potter and the smith. Even
agriculture was not completely developed; the bulk of the population
devoted itself to rear- ing sheep and cattle, and tending the vine, the
olive and the fig. They lived in tents rather than houses, in order to
move more easily to fresh pastures. In time their growing economic
surplus generated trade, and the Jewish mer- chants, by their tenacity
and their skill, began to flourish in Damascus, Tyre and Sidon, and in
the precincts of the Temple itself. There was no coinage till near the
time of the Captivity, but gold and silver, weighed in each trans -
action, became a medium of exchange, and bankers appeared in great
numbers to finance commerce and enterprise. It was nothing strange that
these “money - lenders” should use the courts of the Temple; it was a
custom gen - eral in the Near East, and survives there in many places to
this day . 106 Yahveh beamed upon the growi ng power of the Hebrew
financiers; “thou shalt lend unto many nations,” he said, “but thou
shalt not borrow” 197 — a generous phil- osophy that has made great
fortunes, though it has not seemed, in our cen- tury, to be divinely
inspired.</p>
<p>As in the other countries of the Near East, war captives and convicts
were used as slaves, and hundreds of thousands of them toiled in cutting
timber and transporting materials for such public works as Solomon’s
Temple and palace. But the owner had no power of life and death over his
slaves, and the slave might acquire property and buy his liberty . 198
Men could be sold as bondservants for unpaid debts, or could sell their
children in their place; and this continued to the days of Christ . 109
These typical institutions of the Near East were mitigated in Judea by
generous charity, and a vigorous campaign, by priest and prophet,
against exploitation. The Code laid it down hopefully that “ye shall not
oppress one another”; 200 it asked that Hebrew bondservants should be
released, and debts among Jews canceled, every seventh year ; 201 and
when this was found too idealistic for the masters, the Law proclaimed
the institution of the Jubilee, by which, every fifty years, all slaves
and debtors should be freed. “ And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year,
and proclaim liberty</p>
<p>•Theoretically the land belonged to Yahveh . 106</p>
<p>338 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be
a Jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,
and ye shall re- turn every man unto his family .”“ 3</p>
<p>We have no evidence that this fine edict was obeyed, but we must give
credit to the priests for leaving no lesson in charity untaught. “If
there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren, . . . thou shalt
open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for
his need”; and “take thou no usury” (i.e., interest) “of him .” 208 The
Sabbath rest was to be extended to every employee, even to animals;
stray sheaves and fruits were to be left in the fields and orchards for
the poor to glean . 304 And though these charities were largely for
fellow Jews, “the stranger in the gates” was also to</p>
<p>The Ninth Commandment, by demanding absolute honesty of witnesses,
put the prop of religion under the whole structure of Jewish law. An
oath was to be a religious ceremony: not merely was a man, in swearing,
to place his hand on the genitals of him to whom he swore, as in the old
custom ; 305 he was now to be taking God himself as his witness and his
judge. False wit- nesses, according to the Code, were to receive the
same punishment that their testimony had sought to bring upon their
victims . 306 Religious law was the sole law of Israel; the priests and
the temples were the judges and the courts; and those who refused to
accept the decision of the priests were to be put to death . 307 Ordeal
by the drinking of poisonous water was prescribed in certain cases of
doubtful guilt . 308 There was no other than religious machinery for
enforcing the law; it had to be left to personal conscience, and public
opinion. Minor crimes might be atoned for by confession and compensation
. 300 Capital punishment was decreed, by Yahveh’s instructions, for
murder, kidnaping, idolatry, adu ltery, striking or cursing a parent,
stealing a slave, or “lying with a beast,” but not for the killing of a
servant ; 210 and “thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .” 211 Yahveh
was quite satisfied to have the individual take the</p>

<p>The Tenth Commandment reveals how clearly woman was conceived under
the rubric of property. “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou
shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid -
servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy
neighbor’s.’™* Never - theless, it was an admirable precept; could men
follow it, half the fever and anxiety of our life would be removed.
Strange to say, the greatest of the commandments is not listed among the
Ten, though it is part of the “Law.” It occurs in Leviticus, xix, 18,
lost amid “a repetition of sundry laws,” and reads very simply: “Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”</p>
<p>In general it was a lofty code, sharing its defects with its age,
and</p>
<p>rising to virtues characteristically its own. We must remember that
it was only a law — indeed, only a “priestly Utopia” 21 *— rather than a
descrip- tion of Jewish life; like other codes, it was honored
plentifully in the breach, and won new praise with every violation. But
its influence upon the conduct of the people was at least as great as
that of most legal or moral codes. It gave to the Jews, through the two
thousand years of wandering which they were soon to begin, a “portable
Fatherland,” as Heine was to call it, an intangible and spirtual state;
it kept them united despite every dispersion, proud despite every
defeat, and brought them across the centuries to our own time, a strong
and apparently indestructi- ble people.</p>

<p>an admirable story, told without frill or ornament, with simplicity,
vivid- ness and force. And in a sense we have here not mere history, but
philos- ophy of history; this is the first recorded effort of man to
reduce the multiplicity of past events to a measure of unity by seeking
in them some pervading purpose and significance, some law of sequence
and causation, some illumination for the present and the future. The
conception of his- tory promulgated by the Prophets and the priestly
authors of the Penta- teuch survived a thousand years of Greece and Rome
to become the world-view of European thinkers from Boethius to
Bossuet.</p>
<p>Midway between the history and the poetry are the fascinating ro-</p>
<p>mances of the Bible. There is nothing more perfect in the realm of
prose than the story of Ruth; only less excellent are the tales of Isaac
and Re- becca, Jacob and Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, Samson and
Delilah, Esther, Judith and Daniel. The poetical literature begins with
the “Song of Moses” (Exod. xv) and the “Song of Deborah” (Judges v),
and</p>
<p>reaches finally to the heights of the Psalms. The “penitential” hymns
of the Babylonians had prepared for these, and perhaps had given them
material as well as form; Ikhnaton’s ode to the sun seems to have
contrib - uted to Psalm CIV; and the majority of the Psalms, instead of
being the impressively united work of David, are probably the
compositions of several poets writing long after the Captivity, probably
in the third cen- tury before Christ .” 8 But all this is as irrelevant
as the name or sources of Shakespeare; what matters is that the Psalms
are at the head of the world’s lyric poetry. They were not meant to be
read at a sitting, or in a Higher Critic’s mood; they are at their best
as expressing moments of pious ecstasy and stimulating faith. They are
marred for us by bitter imprecations, tire- some “groanings” and
complaints, and endless adulation of a Yahveh who, with all his
“lovingkindness,” “longsuffering” and “compassion,” pours “smoke out of
his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth” (VIII), promises that “the
wicked shall be turned into hell” (IX), laps up flattery,* and threatens
to “cut off all flattering lips” (XII). The Psalms are full of</p>
<p>military ardor, hardly Christian, but very Pilgrim. Some of them,
how- ever, are jewels of tenderness, or cameos of humility. “Verily
every</p>
<p>man at his best state is altogether vanity. … As for man, his days
are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind
passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no
more”</p>

<p>341</p>
<p>(XXIX, CIII) . In these songs we feel the antistrophic rhythm of
ancient Oriental poetry, and almost hear the voices of majestic choirs
in alternate answering. No poetry has ever excelled this in revealing
metaphor or living imagery; never has religious feeling been more
intensely or vividly expressed. These poems touch us more deeply than
any lyric of love; they move even the sceptical soul, for they give
passionate form to the final longing of the developed mind — for some
perfection to which it may dedica te its striving. Here and there, in
the King James’ Version, are</p>
<p>pithy phrases that have become almost words in our language — “out of
the mouths of babes” (VIII), “the apple of the eye” (XVII), “put not</p>
<p>your trust in princes” (CXLVI); and everywhere, in the original,
are</p>
<p>similes that have never been surpassed: “The rising sun is as a
bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to
run a race” (XIX). We can only imagine what majesty and beauty must
clothe these songs in the sonorous language of their origin.*</p>
<p>When, beside these Psalms, we place in contrast the “Song of Solo
-</p>
<p>mon,” we get a glimpse of that sensual and terrestrial element in
Jewish life which the Old Testament, written almost entirely by prophets
and priests, has perhaps concealed from us — just as Ecclesiastes
reveals a scepti- cism not otherwise discernible in the carefully
selected and edited litera- ture of the ancient Jews. This strangely
amorous composition is an open field for surmise: it may be a collection
of songs of Babylonian origin, celebrating the love of Ishtar and
Tammuz; it may be (since it contains words borrowed from the Greek) the
work of several Hebrew Anacreons touched by the Hellenistic spirit that
entered Judea with Alexander; or (since the lovers address each other as
brother and sister in the Egyptian manner) it may be a flower of
Alexandrian Jewry, plucked by some</p>
<p>quite emancipated soul from the banks of the Nile. In any case its
pres- ence in the Bible is a charming mystery: by what winking — or
hood- winking — of the theologians did these songs of lusty passion find
room between Isaiah and the Preacher?</p>
<p>A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all

<p>This is the voice of youth, and that of the Proverbs is the voice of
old age. Men look to love and life for everything; they receive a little
less than that; they imagine that they have received nothing: these are
the three stages of the pessimist. So this legendary Solomon* warns
youth against the evil woman, “for she hath cast down many wounded; yea,
many strong men have been slain by her. . . . Whoso committeth adultery
with a woman lacketh understanding. . . . There be three things which
are wonderful to me; yea, four which I know not: the way of an eagle in
the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the
midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid .” 221 He agrees with
St. Paul that it is better to marry than to burn. “Rejoice with the wife
of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and the pleasant roe; let
her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with
her love. . . . Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox with hatred therewith .” 222 Can these be the words of the
husband of seven hundred wives?</p>

<p>Next to unchastity, in the way from wisdom, is sloth: “Go to the ant,
thou sluggard. . . . Hpw long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard ?” 228 “Seest
thou a man diligent in his business? — he shall stand before kings .”
284 Y et will the Philosopher not brook crass ambition. “He that maketh
haste to be rich shall not be innocent”; and “the prosperity of fools
shall destroy them .” 225 Work is wisdom, words are mere folly. “In all
labor there is profit, but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.
… A fool</p>
<p>uttereth all his mind, but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards;
. . . even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise .” 228 The
lesson which the Sage never tires of repeating is an almost Socratic
identification of virtue and wisdom, redolent of those schools of
Alexandria in which Hebrew theology was mating with Greek philosophy to
form the intellect of Europe. “Understanding is a well -spring of life
unto him that hath it; but the instruction of fools is folly. . . .
Happy is the man that</p>
<p>findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding; for the mer-
chandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain
thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all things
thou canst desire are not to be compared with her. Length of days is in
her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways
of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace .” 227</p>
<p>Job is earlier than Proverbs; perhaps it was written during the
Exile, and described by allegory the captives of Babylon.* “I call it,”
says the perfervid Carlyle, “one of the grandest things ever written
with a pen. … A noble book; all men’s book! It is our first, oldest
statement of the never-ending problem — man’s destiny, and God’s ways
with him here on this earth. . . . There is nothing written, I think, in
the Bible or out of it, of equal literary merit .” 8304 The problem

Its text is corrupt beyond even the custom of sacred scriptures

to be edifying emendations, and suspects many interpolations and mis-
translations in the accepted chapters. E.g., “Though he slay me, yet
will I trust in him” (xiii, 5) should be, “Yet I tremble not,” or “Yet I
have no hope.” 220 Kallen and ot hers have found in the book the
likeness of a Greek tragedy, written on the model of Euripides. 230

poetry.</li>

<p>344 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>punishing the evil and rewarding the good ? 233 The author of Job now
asked the same questions more resolutely, and offered his hero, perhaps,
as a symbol for his people. All Israel had worshiped Yahveh (fitfully),
as Job had done; Babylon had ignored and blasphemed Yahveh; and yet
Babylon flourished, and Israel ate the dust and wore the sackcloth of
desolation and captivity. What could one say of such a god?</p>
<p>In a prologue in heaven, which some clever scribe may have inserted
to take the scandal out of the book, Satan suggests to Yahveh that Job
is “perfect and upright” only because he is fortunate; would he retain
his piety in adversity? Yahveh permits Satan to heap a variety of
calami- ties upon Job’s head. For a time the hero is as patient as Job;
but at last his fortitude breaks, he ponders suicide, and bitterly
reproaches his god for forsaking him. Zophar, who has come out to enjoy
the sufferings of his friend, insists that God is just, and will yet
reward the good man, even on earth; but Job shuts him up sharply:</p>
<p>No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p>But I have understanding as well as you; . . . yea, who knoweth
not</p>
<p>these things? . . . The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they
that</p>
<p>provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p>
<p>…. Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and</p>
<p>understood it. . . . But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all
physicians of</p>
<p>no value. Oh, that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it</p>
<p>should be your wisdom . 234</p>
<p>He reflects on the brevity of life, and the length of death:</p>
<p>Man that is bom of woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
<p>He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as</p>
<p>a shadow, and continueth not. … For there is hope of a tree,</p>
<p>if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender</p>
<p>branch thereof will not cease. . . . But man dieth, and wasteth</p>
<p>away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the</p>
<p>waters fall from die sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up,
so</p>
<p>man lieth down, and riseth not. … If a man die, shall he live</p>
<p>again ? 238</p>
<p>The debate continues vigorously, and Job becomes more and more</p>
<p>sceptical of his God, until he calls him “Adversary,” and wishes that
this Adversary would destroy himself by writing a book 2333 — perhaps
some</p>

<p>Leibnitzian theodicy. The concluding words of this chapter — “The
words of Job are ended”— suggest that this was the original termination
of a discourse which, like that of Ecclesiates, represented a strong
heretical minority among the Jews.* But a fresh philosopher enters at
this point — Elihu — who demonstrates, in one hundred and sixty-five
verses, the justice of God’s ways with men. Finally, in one of the most
majestic passages in the Bible, a voice comes down out of the
clouds:</p>
<p>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:</p>
<p>Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and</p>
<p>answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of</p>
<p>the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the</p>
<p>measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched his line</p>
<p>upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or</p>
<p>who laid the cornerstone thereof; when the morning stars sang</p>
<p>together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Or who shut</p>
<p>up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued
out</p>
<p>of the womb? When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and</p>
<p>thick darkness a swaddling band for it, and brake up for it my
de-</p>
<p>creed place, and set bars and doors, and said, Hitherto shalt
thou</p>
<p>come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the</p>
<p>dayspring to know his place? . . . Hast thou entered into the</p>
<p>springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the
depth?</p>
<p>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen</p>
<p>the doors of the shadow of death? Hast thou perceived the breath</p>
<p>of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. . . . Hast thou
entered</p>
<p>into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures
of</p>
<p>the hail? . . . Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the
Pleiades,</p>
<p>or loose the bands of Orion? . . . Knowest thou the ordinances of</p>
<p>heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? . . .</p>
<p>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts, or who hath given</p>
<p>understanding to the heart? . . .</p>

<li>“The sceptic,” wrote that prolific sceptic, Renan, “writes little, a

<p>34^ THE story of civilization (chap. XII</p>
<p>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? He that</p>
<p>reproveth God, let him answer it. 2 ”</p>
<p>Job humbles himself in terror before this apparition. Yahveh,
appeased, forgives him, accepts his sacrifice, denounces Job’s friends
for their feeble arguments, 288 and gives Job fourteen thousand sheep,
six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, a thousand she-asses,
seven sons, three daughters, and one hundred and forty years. It is a
lame but happy ending; Job receives everything but an answer to his
questions. The problem re- mained; and it was to have profound effects
upon later Jewish thought. In the days of Daniel (ca. 167 b.c.) it was
to be abandoned as insoluble in terms of this world; no answer could be
given — Daniel and Enoch (and Kant) would say — unless one believed in
some other life, beyond the grave, in which all wrongs would be righted,
the wicked would be punished, and the just would inherit infinite
reward. This was one of the varied currents of thought that flowed into
Christianity, and carried it to victory.</p>
<p>In Ecclesiastes* the problem is given a pessimistic reply;
prosperity</p>
<p>and misfortune have nothing to do with virtue and vice.</p>
<p>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just</p>
<p>man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
man</p>
<p>that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. … So I returned, and</p>
<p>considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and be-
held the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no com-</p>
<p>forter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power. . .
.</p>
<p>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
of</p>
<p>judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter, . .
.</p>
<p>for there be higher than they. 2 “</p>
<p>It is not virtue and vice that det ermine a man’s lot, but blind and
merciless chance. “I saw under the sun that the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor
yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but
time and chance happeneth to them all.”” 2 Even wealth is insecure, and
does not long bring happiness. “He that loveth silver shall not be
satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this
is also vanity. . . . The</p>

<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but
the abundance of the riqh will not suffer him to sleep .” 243
Remembering his relatives, he formulates Malthus in a line: “When goods
are increased, they are increas ed that eat them .” 224 Nor can he be
soothed by any legend of a Golden Past, or a Utopia to come: things have
always been as they are now, and so they will always be. “Say not thou,
What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou
dost not inquire wisely concerning this”; 245 one must choose his
historians carefully. And “the thing that hath been, it is that which
shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done; and there
is nothing new under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said,
See, this is new? It hath been already of old time, which was before us
.” 240 Progress, he thinks, is a delusion; civilizations have been
forgotten, and will be again . 247</p>
<p>In general he feels that life is a sorry business, and might well be
dis- pensed with; it is aimless and circuitous motion without permanent
result, and ends where it began; it is a futile struggle, in which
nothing is certain except defeat.</p>
<p>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
is</p>
<p>vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh</p>
<p>under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation
cometh; but the earth abideth forever. The sun also ariseth, and the
wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it</p>
<p>whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again
according</p>
<p>to his circuits. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is
not</p>
<p>full; unto the place from whence the rivers came, thither they
re-</p>
<p>turn again. . . . Wherefore I praised the dead which are already</p>
<p>dead, more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is
he,</p>
<p>than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the</p>
<p>evil work that is done under the sun. … A good name is better</p>
<p>than precious oin tment, and the day of death than the day of
one’s</p>
<p>birth . 248</p>
<p>For a time he seeks the answer to the riddle of life in abandonment
to pleasure. “Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better</p>
<p>thing under the sun than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry.” But
“behold, this also is vanity .” 268 The difficulty with pleasure is
woman, from whom the Preacher seems to have received some unforgettable
sting. “One man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all
those</p>
<p>348 the story of civilization (chap. xii</p>
<p>have I not found. … I find more bitter than death the woman whose
heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God
shall escape her .” 201 He concludes his digression into this most
obscure realm of philosophy by reverting to the advice of Solomon and
Voltaire, who did not practise it: “Live joyfully with the wife whom
thou lovest, all</p>
<p>the days of the life of thy vanity which God hath given thee under
the sun .” 262</p>
<p>Even wisdom is a questionable thing; he lauds it generously, but
he</p>
<p>suspects that anything more than a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing. “Of making many books,” he writes, with uncanny foresight, “there
is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .” 263 It might be
wise to s eek wisdom if God had given it a better income; “wisdom is
good, with an inheritance”; otherwise it is a snare, and is apt to
destroy its lovers . 251 (Truth is like Yahveh, who said to Moses: “Thou
canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me a nd live.” 266 )
In the end the wise man dies as thoroughly as the fool, and both come to
the same odor. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
con-</p>
<p>cerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail
hath</p>
<p>God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. I have</p>
<p>seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all
is</p>
<p>vanity and a chasing after the wind. … I communed with mine</p>
<p>own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten</p>
<p>more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jeru-</p>
<p>salem; yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowl-</p>
<p>edge. And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness</p>
<p>and folly; I perceived that this also is a chasing after the wind.
For</p>
<p>in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge</p>
<p>increaseth sorrow . 266</p>
<p>All these darts of outrageous fortune might be borne with hope and
courage if the just man could look forward to some happiness beyond the
grave. But that, too, Ecclesiastes feels, is a myth; man is an animal,
and dies like any other beast.</p>
<p>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even</p>
<p>one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other;
yea,</p>
<p>they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence over a
beast; for all is vanity. All go unto one place: all are of the
dust,</p>
<p>JUDEA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>and all turn to dust again. . . . Wherefore I perceive that there
is</p>
<p>nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works;</p>
<p>for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall
be</p>
<p>after him? . . . Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
thy</p>
<p>might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in
the grave, whither thou goest.® 7</p>
<p>What a commentary on the wisdom so lauded in the Proverbs! Here,
evidently, civilization had for a time gone to seed. The vitality of
Israel’s youth had been exhausted by her struggles against the empires
that surrounded her. The Yahveh in whom she had trusted had not come to
her aid; and in her desolation and dispersion she raised to the skies
this bitterest of all voices in literature to express the profoundest
doubts that ever come to the human soul.</p>
<p>Jerusalem had been restored, but not as the citadel of an
unconquerable god; it was a vassal city ruled now by Persia, now by
Greece. In 334</p>
<p>b.c. the young Alexander stood at its gates, and demanded the
surrender of the capital. The high-priest at first refused; but the next
morning, having had a dream, he consented. He ordered the clergy to put
on their most impressive vestments, and the people to garb themselves in
immac- ulate white; then he led the population pacifically out through
the gates to solicit peace. Alexander bowed to the high-priest,
expressed his ad- miration for the people and their god, and accepted
Jerusalem.® 8</p>
<p>It was not the end of Judea. Only the first act had been played in
this strange drama that binds forty centuries. Christ would be the
second, Ahasuerus the third; today another act is played, but it is not
the last. Destroyed and rebuilt, destroyed and rebuilt, Jerusalem rises
again, symbol of the vitality and pertinacity of an heroic race. The
Jews, who are as old as history, may be as lasting as civilization.</p>
