<h4 id="chapter-xxix-germany-and-napoleon">CHAPTER XXIX Germany and
Napoleon</h4>
<p>1786 — 181 1</p>
<p>I. THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE: 1 8 00</p>
<p>I N the opinion of the Prussian patriot but great historian Heinrich
von Treitschke, “Never since the time of Luther had Germany occupied so
shining a position in the European world as now [1800], when the
greatest heroes and poets of their age belonged to our nation.” 1 We
might rank Fred - erick victorious below Napoleon shattered, but beyond
doubt the light of Goethe and Schiller shone unrivaled in poetry and
prose from Edinburgh to Rome; and the German philosophers, from Kant
through Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel to Schopenhauer, overawed the
European mind from London to St. Petersburg. It was Germany’s second
Renaissance.</p>
<p>Like Italy in the sixteenth century, Germany was not a nation, if
that means a people living under the same government and laws. Germany
in 1800 was a loose concatenation of some 250 “states,” each with its
own laws and taxes, many with their own army, coinage, religion,
customs, and dress, and some speaking a dialect unintelligible to half
the German world. How- ever, their written language was the same, and
gave their writers a third of the Continent for their potential
audience.</p>
<p>We should note, in passing, that the relative independence of the
indi- vidual states, as in Renaissance Italy, allowed an unstereotyped
diversity, a stimulating rivalry, a freedom of character, experiment,
and thought, which might have been overwhelmed, in the centralizing
capital of a large state, by the weight.of the compact mass. Would not
the old cities of Germany, still so attractively unique, have lost
vitality and character if they had been sub- ject to Berlin, politically
and culturally, as the cities of France were or are to Paris? And if all
these parts of Germany had formed a united nation, would not this
heartland of Europe, rich in materials and men, have overrun Europe
irresistibly?</p>
<p>In only one way were the German states limited in their independence:
they accepted membership in that “Holy Roman Empire” which had be- gun
in 800 with the papal crowning of Charlemagne — known to the Ger- mans
as their own Frankish Karl der Grosse. In 1800 this Empire included a
dazzling variety of German states. Outstanding were nine “electoral
states” that elected the emperor: Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony,
Brunswick- Liineburg, Cologne, Mainz, Hanover, and Trier (Treves). Next
were</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xwenty- seven “spiritual lands,” ruled by Catholic prelates, as if
recalling the episcopal rule of cities in the dying Roman Empire of the
West a millennium before: the archbishopric of Salzburg (where Mozart
fretted), and the bishoprics of Munster, Liege, Wurzburg, Bamberg,
Osnabriick, Paderborn, Augsburg, Hildesheim, Fulda, Speyer, Regensburg
(Ratisbon), Constance, Worms, Liibeck… Lay princes ruled thirty-seven
states, including Hesse- Cassel, Hesse-Darmstadt, Holstein, Wiirttemberg
(with Stuttgart) , Sachsen- (Saxe-) Weimar (with Goethe), Sachsen- Gotha
(with its “enlightened despot” Duke Ernest II), Braunschweig -
(Brunswick-) Wolfenbiittel, Baden (with Baden-Baden, Karlsruhe)… Fifty
cities were Reichstadte, self- governed free “towns of the Empire”:
Hamburg, Cologne, Frankfurt -am- Main, Bremen, Worms, Speyer, Nuremberg
(Niimberg), Ulm… From these and other parcels of Germany came electors,
“Imperial Knights,” and other representatives to the Reichstag, or
Imperial Diet, which met at Regensburg as summoned by their emperor. In
1792 the electors chose Francis II of Austria to head the Holy Roman
Empire, and crowned him in a sumptuous ceremony that drew notables from
all parts of Germany to Frankfurt-am-Main. He proved to be the last of
the long line.</p>
<p>By 1 800 this once impressive and generally beneficent institution
had lost nearly all its efficiency and usefulness. It was a relic of
feudalism; each seg- ment had been ruled by a manorial lord, subject to
a central power; that central power had been weakened by the growth of
the member states in population, wealth, secularism, and military force.
The religious unity of the “holy” Empire had been ended by the
Reformation, the Thirty Years’ War, and the Seven Years’ War of 1756
-63; north Germany, in 1800, was Protestant, south Germany was Catholic;
and west Germany had lost some piety to the French Enlightenment and the
Aufklarung of Lessing’s days. Nationalism, large or small, grew as
religion declined, for some creed- political or social — must hold a
society together against the centrifugal egoism of its constituent
souls.</p>
<p>The polarization of Germany between the Protestant north, led by
Prus- sia, and the Catholic south led by Austria had dire results in the
failure of the two foci to unite against Napoleon at Austerlitz in 1805
or at Jena in 1806. Long before these blows, Austria itself had come to
ignore the Imperial Diet, and other states followed Austria’s lead. 2 In
1788 only fourteen princes out of an eligible hundred, only eight out of
fifty eligible town chieftains, obeyed the summons to an Imperial Diet;
3 decisions were impossible. In the Treaties of Campoformio (1797) and
Luneville (1801) Napoleon compelled Austria to recognize French rule of
the left, or west, bank of the Rhine; so a rich section of the Holy
Roman Empire — including the cities of Speyer, Mannheim, Worms, Mainz,
Bingen, Trier, Coblenz, Aachen, Bonn, and Cologne — passed under French
rule. By 1801 it was generally agreed that the Holy Roman Empire, as
Voltaire had said, was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire; that no
important state recognized its authority, or the authority of the pope;
that some new form of order and cooperation amid</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) GERMANY AND NAPOLEON 589</p>
<p>he chaos would have to be devised, accepted, or imposed. Napoleon ac-
cepted the challenge.</p>
<p>H. THE CONFEDERATION OF THE RHINE: 1806</p>
<p>The great river was a gallery of scenic wonders and historic memories
sometimes architecturally enshrined. But it was also a living blessing
to the economy, watering a responsive soil, binding each town with a
dozen others rivaling its culture and trading for its goods. Feudalism
here had lost its uses and its fangs as commerce and industry peopled
the riverside. But within this fluent prosperity four problems festered:
epicurean lassitude among the rulers, corruption in the bureaucracy, a
disruptive concentra- tion of wealth, and a military fragmentation
inviting conquerors.</p>
<p>The road to a new organization of the Rhineland states was opened by
the promise of both France and Austria to recompense with new properties
those German notables who had lost their lands through Austria’s recogni
- tion of French sovereignty over the left bank of the Rhine. The clamor
of the dispossessed for rehabilitation led to the summoning, by France
and Austria, of the Congress of Rastatt (December 16, 1797). There some
irrev- erent princes proposed that the ecclesiastic principalities
should be “secular - ized”— i.e., in plain terms, transferred from the
ruling bishops to the clamor- ing laity. Unable to agree, the Congress
submitted the matter to the next Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. It
remained in abeyance until Napoleon returned from Egypt, seized power in
France, defeated Austria at Marengo, and came to an agreement with
Austria, Prussia, and Russia, by which a deputation of the Imperial Diet
issued, on February 25, 1803, a decree over- whelmingly entitled
Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, summarily remaking the map and governance
of western Germany. Nearly all the ruling bishops were dispossessed.
Prussia accepted with equanimity the reduction of episco- pal rule;
Austria might have mourned, but she was powerless.</p>
<p>The new governors realized that Austria would be unwilling, as well
as unable, to give them military protection; nor could they (mostly
Catholic) expect protection from Protestant Prussia. One after another
the remade states turned to Napoleon, who was militarily supreme and
officially Catho- lic. At Munich, on December 30, 1805, Karl Theodor von
Dalberg, arch- bishop-elector of Mainz, meeting a Napoleon fresh from
victory at Auster- litz, invited him to accept the leadership of the
reorganized principalities. The busy Emperor took half a year to make up
his mind. He realized that for a French nation to assume protectorate
over a third of Germany was to invite the enmity of the rest, as well as
resharpened hostility from England and Russia. On July 12, 1806,
Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden, Hesse-Darm- stadt, Nassau, Berg, and many
other states united in a “Rheinbund,” or Confederation of the Rhine; on
August 1 Napoleon agreed to assume its protectorate. While the major
constituents retained independence in internal affairs, they agreed to
submit their foreign policy to his judgment, and to</p>
<p>59 ° THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xplace substantial military forces at his command. 4 They notified
Francis II and the Imperial Diet that they were no longer members of the
Reich. On August 6 Francis officially declared the Holy Roman Empire
dissolved, and renounced the Imperial tide, remaining emperor of
Austria. The glory of the Hapsburgs faded, and a new Charlemagne, ruling
from France, assumed authority over western Germany.</p>
<p>The Confederation conferred vital benefits and exacted fatal returns.
It brought the Code Napoleon (with abolition of feudal dues and
ecclesiastical tithes), freedom of religious worship, equality before
the law, the French system of prefectural administration, centralized
but competent, and a trained judiciary more than formerly difficult to
bribe. The basic flaw in the structure was that it rested on foreign
power, and could last only as long as this alien protection outweighed
its domestic costs. When Napoleon took German sons to fight Austrians in
1809, the protectorate was strained; when he took thousands of German
sons to fight Russia in 1812, and required heavy financial support for
his campaign, the protectorate seemed a burden in gross topping its
benefits in retail; when Confederation Germans were conscripted to fight
Prussian Germans in 1813, the Confederation only awaited a substantial
French reverse to bring the whole frail structure down upon the
exhausted Corsican’s head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was a triumph for Napoleon that he had arranged a double
security for France’s new frontier. The terrain west of the Rhine had
been incorporated into France, and the rich lands on the east side,
reaching even to the Elbe, were now allied with, and dependent upon,
France. And though the Confederation disintegrated after Napoleon’s
defeat at Leipzig in 1813, it left a memory for Bismarck, even as
Napoleon’s unification of Italy left an inspiration for Mazzini,
Garibaldi, and Cavour.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>napoleon’s GERMAN PROVINCES</li>
</ol>
<p>North of Cologne were two regions which, though they became members
of the Rheinbund, were completely Napoleon’s by the processes of war,
and were governed by him or his relatives: the grand duchy of Berg by
his brother-in-law Joachim Murat, and the kingdom of Westphalia, by his
brother Jerome. When Murat was promoted to Naples (1808), Napoleon
governed the duchy through commissioners. Year by year he introduced
French methods of administration, taxation, and law. Feudalism, already
vestigial, was ended, industry and commerce were developed until the
region became a thriving center of mining and metallurgy.</p>
<p>Westphalia was more varied and immense. Its western end was the duchy
of Cleves (point of origin for Henry VIII’s fourth wife); thence it
ranged eastward through Munster, Hildesheim, Brunswick, and
Wolfenbiittel to Magdeburg; through Paderborn to Cassel (the capital),
and across the Rivers Ruhr, Ems, and Lippe to the Saale and the
Elbe.</p>
<p>Jerome Bonaparte, made king in 1807, was then twenty-three years
old,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>GERMANY AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>591</p>
<p>and was more interested in pleasure than in power. Napoleon, hoping
that responsibilities would mature and settle him, sent him letters of
excellent counsel, realistic yet humane, but this was countered by
financial exactions, and Jerome found it difficult to satisfy his
brother’s demand for revenues and his own relish for a lavish court and
style. Even so, he cooperated effec- tively in introducing the reforms
that Napoleon usually brought with him in the creative period of his
conquests. It was one of Bonaparte’s maxims that “men are powerless to
determine the future; on ly institutions fix the destinies of nations.”
5 So he gave Westphalia a code of laws, efficient and compara - tively
honest administration, religious freedom, a competent judiciary, the
jury system, equality before the law, uniform taxation, and a system of
periodic audit of all governmental operations. A national assembly was
to be elected by a limited suffrage; fifteen of the hundred delegates
were to be chosen from among merchants and manufacturers, fifteen from
among savants and other persons who had earned distinction. The assembly
was not empowered to initiate legislation, but it could criticize the
measures sub- mitted to it by the Council of State, and its advice was
often accepted.</p>
<p>The economic reforms were basic. Feudalism was now ended. Free enter-
prise should open every field to every ambition. Roads and waterways
were to be maintained and improved; internal tolls were abolished;
weights and measures were made uniform throughout the kingdom. A decree
of March 24, 1 809, made every commune responsible for its poor,
requiring it to pro- vide them with employment or sustenance. 6 The
taxpayers complained.</p>
<p>Culturally Westphalia was the most progressive of the German states.
It had nurtured intellectual life ever since — and before — Fulda’s
monastic library fed the Renaissance with classical manucripts;
Hildesheim had had Leibniz, and Wolfenbiittel had had Lessing. Now King
Jerome had as his librarian Jacob Grimm, whom we shall meet as the
founder of Teutonic philology. In 1807, at Napoleon’s invitation,
Johannes von Muller, the lead - ing historian of the age, left his post
as royal historiographer at Berlin to come to Westphalia as secretary of
state and (1808-09) director-general of public education. Westphalia had
then five universities, which under Jerome were reorganized as three:
Gottingen, Halle, and Marburg. Two of these were famous throughout
Europe; we have seen Coleridge going straight from Nether Stowey to
Gottingen, and returning to England a year later, dizzy with German
ideas.</p>
<p>Against these boons two evils weighed heavily: taxation and
conscription. Napoleon required from each of his dependencies a
substantial contribution to his government, to his daily more lavish
court, and to the expenses of his armies. His argument was simple: if
Austria or some other reactionary power should defeat or otherwise
unseat him, the blessings that he had brought with him would be taken
away. For the same reason the states under his protec- tion must share
with France the obligation to provide sturdy sons for mili- tary
training, and, if necessary, the sacrifice of life. Till 1813 Jerome’s
subjects bore this drain manfully; after all, in Napoleon’s armies the
knout was unknown, promotion was by merit, any soldier might become an
offi-</p>
<p>592</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xcer, even a marshal. But by 1813 Westphalia had sent 8,000 young men
to serve Napoleon in Spain, 16,000 to serve him in Russia; from Spain
only 800 returned, from Russia 2,000.</p>
<p>Northeast of Westphalia was the electorate of Hanover. In 1714 its
elector had become King George I of England, and Hanover had become an
Eng- lish dependency. The current elector was George III, who had made
it a point of patriotism not to step out of Britain; so he left the
great landowners of Hanover to rule the province “for the benefit of the
most exclusive aris - tocracy in Germany. All valuable posts… were
monopolized by the nobles,… who took care that none of the burdens of
taxation should fall upon themselves,” and that “the burgher and peasant
should contribute most.” Feudalism survived, softened by an almost
family relation between master and man. Local government was honest
beyond belief. 7</p>
<p>In 1803, on the resumption of war with England, Napoleon ordered his
troops and administrators to take control in Hanover, to guard against
pos- sible landings by British forces, and to exclude all British goods
from entry. The French met little resistance. In 1807 Napoleon, busy
with larger con- cerns, attached Hanover to Westphalia, and left it to
the taxing devices of King Jerome. The Hanoverians prayed for the return
of England.</p>
<p>By contrast with Hanover, the Hanseatic cities — Hamburg, Bremen,
Lii- beck — were havens of prosperity and pride. The League itself had
long since ceased to exist, but the decline of Antwerp and Amsterdam
under French control had transferred much of their commerce to Hamburg.
Situated at the mouth of the Elbe, the city — boasting in 1 800 a
population of 1 1 5,000 souls — seemed designed for maritime trade, and
for the expeditious reship- ment of imported goods. It was governed by
its leading merchants and financiers, but with a degree of skill and
fairness that made their monopoly bearable. Napoleon itched to bring
these mercantile cities under his rule, to enlist them in the embargo on
British imports, and to help him, with their loans, to finance his wars.
He sent Bourrienne and others to stop the flow of British goods into
Hamburg; the avid ex-secretary grew rich by winking both eyes. Finally
Napoleon brought the great city under his rule (1810), and so harassed
the citizens that they formed secret societies to assassinate him, and
daily plotted his fall.</p>

its citizens as Sachsen, to the French as Saxe, which once had ranged
from Bohemia to the Baltic, had left its name on various -sexes in

content to be a prosperous electorate spreading to right and left of the
Elbe from Lu ther’s Wittenberg to Dresden, the Paris of Germany.</p>

<p>GERMANY AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>593</p>
<p>Under the long rule of Frederick Augustus III as elector
(1768-1806)</p>
<p>and as King Frederick Augustus I (1806-27), the country, blessed by
the Elbe as its nourishing mother, soon recovered its prosperity.
Dresden again rejoiced in its rococo architecture, its spacious
thoroughfares and handsome bridges, its Sistine Madonna and Meissen
pottery. The young ruler, though never outstanding as a statesman,
managed his realm judiciously, spent his revenues carefully, paid off
the national debt, and developed at Freiberg a famous School of Mines.
Dresden’s rival, Leipzig, resumed its annual book fair, where publishers
from everywhere in Europe offered their latest wares, and Germany’s
flourishing literature led the intellectual parade.</p>
<p>Frederick Augustus “the Just” joined Prussia and Austria in an

leon’s army, in 1806, was approaching Jena, Frederick was caught

<li>Prussia: Frederick’s legacy, 1786 -87</li>
</ol>
<p>At the death of Frederick II the Great the kingdom of Prussia
consisted of the electorate of Brandenburg; the duchies of Silesia and
Farther Pomerania; the provinces of East Prussia — with Konigsberg,
Friedland, and Memel — and West Prussia, taken from Poland in 1772; and
divers enclaves in western Germany, including East Friesland, Munster,
and Essen. After Frederick’s death Prussia added the region of Thorn and
Danzig in the Second Partition of Poland (1792); Warsaw and the heart of
Poland in the Third Partition (1795); Ansbach, Bayreuth, and Mansfeld in
1791; Neuchatel, in Switzer- land, in 1 797. Prussia seemed resolved to
absorb all northern Germany when Napoleon relieved her of the task.</p>
<p>The man who had made possible this expansion of Prussian power was
the father of Frederick the Great. Frederick William I, besides
disciplining his son and his people to bear suffering silently, had left
him the best army in Christendom, and a nation tightly organized with
universal education,</p>
<p>594</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xuniversal taxation, and universal military service; Prussia had
become a mor- sel fit for a martial king. All Europe, all Germany, all
Prussia trembled at the sight of this man-eating monarch, with his
domineering Junker officers, his six- foot grenadiers. “Don’t get tall,”
a mother cautioned her son, “or the re - cruiters will get you.” 8</p>
<p>To that army and state Frederick the Great (r. 1740-86) added a per-
sonal genius sharpened by Voltaire, and a stoicism rooted in his genes.
He raised Prussia from a small kingdom rivaled by Saxony and Bavaria to
a power equal to Austria in the German world, and standing as the
strongest barrier to the persistent pressure of the fertile Slavs to
reach again their old frontier on the Elbe. Internally he built a
judiciary famous for its integrity, and a corps of administrators which
gradually replaced the nobility as the officialdom of the state. He
established freedom of speech, press, and wor- ship, and under his pr
otection “the German school system superseded the profound spiritual
slumber of priestly education.” 9 He was the one man of his time who
could outwit Voltaire and teach Napoleon. “The great Fred - erick,” said
Napoleon in 1797, “is the hero whom I love to consult in everything, in
war and in administration; I have studied his principles in the midst of
camps, and his familiar letters are for me lessons of philosophy.”

<p>There were some gaps in his achievement. He found no time, in his
cam- paigns, to bring Prussian feudalism to the more humane level which
it had reached in the Rhineland states; and his wars had left his people
in a condi- tion of poverty and exhaustion that were partly responsible
for the decline of Prussia after his death. Frederick William II (r.
1786-97), reversing the tastes of his childless uncle, was fonder of
women and art than of govern- ment and war. He supplemented his first
wife with a mistress, who bore him five children; he divorced his wife
in 1769, and married Friederike Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, who bore him
seven children; and during this marriage he persuaded his court
preachers to let him contract morganatic unions with Julie von Voss
(1787), who died two years later, and then Countess Sophie Donhoff
(1790), who bore him a son. He found time to play the violon- cello, to
welcome visits by Mozart and Beethoven, to establish a music academy and
a national theater. He financed and promulgated (1794) a new law code
containing many liberal elements. Taking a religious turn, he al- lowed
his favorite, the reformed rationalist 11 Johann von Wollner, to issue
(1788) a Religionsedikt ending religious toleration, and establishing a
cen- sorship that drove many writers from Berlin.</p>
<p>His foreign policy admits of defense. He refused to continue the
aggres- sive stance of his predecessor; flouting a century of
precedents, he sought friendship with Austria as a major step toward
German unity and security. He did not like the French Revolution, being
content with monarchy (so was his people), and he sent some troops to
join in the defeat at Valmy (1792); but he was glad to bring their
survivors home to help him in the Second Partition of Poland. In 1795 he
signed the Peace or Basel with France, which left him free to take
Warsaw in the Third Partition.</p>
<p>Despite his acquisitions, he had allowed his country to decline in
wealth</p>

<p>and power. As early as 1789, Mirabeau, after a long stay in Berlin,
wrote prophetically: “The Prussian monarchy is so constituted that it
could not cope with any calamity.” 12 The Army grew lax in discipline
and insolent with pride; the bureaucracy had softened into corruption
and intrigue; the finances of the state were in disorder and near
insolvency. 13 “Only the in - cisive demonstration of war could display
to this blinded generation the inward decay which… paralyzed aU activity
by the magic of ancient renown.” 14</p>

</ol>
<p>So the amorous King died, and the care of the ailing state fell to
his son Frederick William III, who carried the burden through Napoleon
and Met- ternich till 1 840. Everyone wondered how he could last so
long, being weak in will and benign in sentiment. He had all the virtues
which a good citizen is instructed to develop or profess: cooperation,
justice, kindness, modesty, marital fidelity, and a love of peace. He
freed the serfs on the royal do- main. In 1793 he married Luise (Louise)
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, seven- teen, beautiful, passionately patriotic,
and soon the idol of the nation; she remained chief source of the
happiness into which he seemed to invite every calamity.</p>
<p>The new century brought him one crisis after another. In 1803 the
French seized Hanover, whose neutrality had been guaranteed by Prussia;
the young officers in the Prussian Army clamored for at least a breach,
if not war, with France; Frederick William held his peace. French forces
closed the mouths of the Weser and the Elbe, hurting Prussian trade;
Frederick counseled pa- tience. Queen Louise pleaded for war; dressed in
the uniform of the regi- ment that bore her name, she paraded on
horseback, and breathed fire into the undefeated Army; Prince Louis
Ferdinand, cousin to the King, longed for a chance to show his mettle;
the aging Duke of Brunswick offered to lead the Prussian Army; General
Bliicher, hero-to-be at Waterloo, supported him; Frederick William
withstood them quietly. In 1805 Austria, challeng- ing Napoleon, sought
Prussian aid; the King was not ready.</p>
<p>But when the French, en route to Austerlitz, marched through Prussian
Bayreuth, Frederick William’s patience ran out. H e invited Alexander of
Russia to a conference at Potsdam; there they took oath, at the tomb of
Frederick the Great, to stand together against Napoleon, and go to the
aid of Austria. Alexander’s troops marched south and suffered defeat. By
the time Prus sia’s army was mobilized the battle was over, and
Alexander was in flight to Russia. Napoleon gave Frederick William a
lenient but compro- mising peace (December 15, 1805; February 15, 1806):
Prussia was to cede Neuchatel, Cleves, and Ansbach to France, and was to
receive Hanover in return. Eager for this long-coveted prize, Frederick
William agreed to close all Prussian ports to British goods, and signed
a defensive-offensive alliance with France. England declared war upon
Prussia.</p>
<p>596</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XNapoleon, challenging Nemesis, proceeded to form the Confederation
of the Rhine, which surrounded some Prussian provinces in western
Germany. Hearing that Napoleon was secretly offering Hanover to England,
Frederick William entered into a secret alliance with Russia (July,
1806) for defense against France. On August 1 Napoleon took all western
Germany under his protectorate. On August 9 Frederick William mobilized
part of his army; on September 4 he reopened Prussian ports to British
goods; on September 13 he ordered his troops to enter Saxony. Joined by
the Saxon forces, his generals, under the Duke of Brunswick, commanded
200,000 men. Furious at what he considered the violation of two treaties
and an alliance, Napoleon ordered his armies, already stationed in
Germany, to converge upon the front and flank of the allies. He himself
hurried to the front and supervised the annihilation of the Prussians
and the Saxons at Jena and Auerstedt on the same day, October 14,
1806.</p>
<p>That story has been told from the view of France. From Prussia’s side
it was one of the darkest tragedies in her history. Frederick William,
with his government and family, fled to East Prussia, and tried to
govern from Memel. Napoleon, fr om the King’s chambers in Berlin, issued
orders to a continent, and proclaimed the Continental Blockade. His
troops drove the Prussians out of Poland, defeated the Russians at
Friedland, and escorted Napoleon to Tilsit, where he made peace with
Alexander. There Frederick William learned the final terms on which
Prussia would be allowed to exist. It must cede to France all Prussian
lands west of the Elbe, and must return to Poland all of Prussia’s
pilferings in the three partitions. It must accept</p>
<p>vn. Prussia reborn: 1807-12</p>
<p>There is a tough kernel in the German character — firmed by centuries
of arduous survival between alien and martial peoples — that can bear
defeat proudly and bide its time for response. And there were then men
like Stein and Hardenberg, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, who never let a
day pass without thinking how Prussia could be redeemed. Those million
serfs, hope- less under ancient thralls — what energy might they pour
into the Prussian economy if they were released from humiliating burdens
and were wel- comed into free enterprise on the soil or in the towns?
And those towns, now listless under commerce-scorning nobles governing
the nation from a central distant capital — what invigorating
initiatives might they develop, in</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX)</p>
<p>GERMANY AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>industry, business, and finance, under the stimulus and experiments
of free- dom? Revolutionary France had freed its serfs and prospered,
but it had kept the towns under the political tutelage of Paris; why not
steal a march on the conqueror and free the towns as well as the
serfs?</p>
<p>So thought Freiherr Heinrich Friedrich Karl vo m und zum Stein, “of
and at the Rock,” the ancestral town of his family on the River Lahn,
which flowed into the Rhine above Coblenz. He was not a baron but a
Freiherr, a freeman, belonging to the Reichsrittershaft, or Imperial
Knighthood, pledged to defend his domain and the realm. He was born
(October 26,</p>
<ol start="1757" type="1">
<li>not “of and at the Rock,” but in nearby Nassau, son of a chamber -
lain to the Elector of Mainz. At sixteen he entered the school of law
and politics in the University of Gottingen. There he read Montesquieu,
fol- lowed him in admiring the British Constitution, and resolved to be
great. He served his legal apprenticeship in the law courts of the Holy
Roman Empire at Wetzlar and at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1780 he entered the Prussian civil service, and worked in the
adminis- tration of Westphalian manufactures and mines. By 1796 he had
won a prominent position in the economic administration of all Prussian
provinces along the Rhine. His capacity for work, and the success of his
proposals, brought him a call to Berlin in 1804 to serve as minister of
state for trade. Within a month he was commissioned to help in the
Ministry of Finance. When news reached the capital that Napoleon had
shattered the Prussian Army at Jena, Stein succeeded in removing to
Memel the contents of the Prussian Treasury; with these funds Frederick
William III was able to finance his government in exile. Perhaps the
excitement and disasters of war sharpened the temper of the King and his
ministers; on January 3, 1807, Frederick William III dismissed Stein as
“a refractory, insolent, obstinate, and disobedient official, who, proud
of his genius and his talents,… acts from passion and from personal
hatred and rancor.” 16 Stein returned to his home in Nassau. Six months
later, having heard Napoleon recommend Stein as an administrator, the
King offered Stein the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>
<p>It was precisely the post from which the irascible Freiherr could
best ad- vance reforms fit to release the energies of the Prussian
people. By October 4, 1 807, he was at his new post; by October 9 he had
prepared for the King the proclamation which millions of peasants and
hundreds of Prussian liber- als had long pleaded for. Article I was
apparently modest, declaring the right of “every inhabitant of our
States” to buy and own land; but this right had hitherto been refused to
peasants. Article II allowed any Prussian to engage in any lawful
industry or business; so, as under Napoleon, career was open to talent
of whatever pedigree, and class barriers were removed from the economy.
Article X forbade any further enserfdom; and Article XII declared that
“from Martinmas ceases all villeinage in Our entire States…. There shall
be only free persons.” 17 Many nobles resisted the edict, and it was not
fully enforced till 1 8 1 1.</p>
<p>Stein and has liberal associates labored through the year 1808 to
free the towns of Prussia from rule by feudal barons, or retired army
officers, or tax</p>
<p>59 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xcommissioners with almost limitless powers. On November 19, 1808,
the King, again a willing reformer, issued a “Municipal Ordinance” by
which the towns were to be governed by a local assembly choosing its own
offi- cials; except that in large towns the burgomaster was to be
appointed by the king from three men chosen by the assembly. So began
the healthy local political life that grew into th e outstanding
excellence of Germany’s munici - pal administration.</p>
<p>Stein was not alone in remaking Prussia. Gerhard von Scharnhorst (175
5 —</p>
<p>1813), Count August Neithardt von Gneisenau (1760-1831), and Prince
Karl von Hardenberg (1750-1822) labored together to rebuild a Prussian
Army, using various devices to evade Napoleon’s restrictions. The
progress of tms operation was such that Stein, on August 1 5, 1 808,
wrote to a Prus- sian officer a letter which fell into French hands and
was printed in the Moniteur for September 8. Part of it said:</p>
<p>Exasperation grows every day in Germany; we must feed it and work
upon people. I very much wish that we could make connections with Hesse
and Westphalia, and that we should prepare ourselves for certain events;
that we should seek to maintain relations with men of energy and good
will, and that we could put such people in contact with others…. The
affairs of Spain leave a lively impression; they prove what we long
since should nave suspected. It would be useful to spread these tidings
prudently. We think here that war between France and Austria is
inevitable. This conflict will decide the fate of Europe. 18</p>
<p>Napoleon, about to leave for a major campaign in Spain, ordered Fred-
erick William to dismiss Stein. The King, still at Memel, delayed
compli- ance, until he was warned that the French would continue their
occupation of Prussian territory until he obeyed. On November 24, 1808,
Stein was again dismissed; and on December 16 Napoleon, from Madrid,
issued a decree outlawing him, confiscating all his goods, and ordering
his arrest wherever found in French-controlled territory. Stein escaped
into Bohemia.</p>
<p>His loss to Prussia was made up by the appointment (18x0) of Harden-
berg as state chancellor — in effect prime minister. He had been part of
the government before, had reorganized the Ministry of Finance, had
negotiated the peace of 1795, had shared responsibility for the disaster
of 1806, and had been dismissed at the insistence of Napoleon (1807).
Now, at the age of sixty, while Napoleon was amiably absorbed with his
new Empress, Harden- berg moved the King toward constitutional monarchy
by persuading him to summon first an Assembly of Notables ( 1 8 1 1 ) ,
and then (1812) a Repre- sentative Assembly of the Nation with
consultative powers, as a check and prod on the king. An admirer of the
French philosophies, Hardenberg secu- larized church property, insisted
on civic equality for the Jews (March 11,</p>
<p>1812), levied a property tax on nobles and a profit tax on
businessmen, ended the obstructive monopolies of the guilds, and
established freedom of enter- prise and trade.</p>
<p>The rapid reconstruction of Prussia between 1807 and 1812 revealed a
saving fund of strength in the German character. Under hostile
French</p>

<p>GERMANY AND NAPOLEON</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>eyes, and under one of Prussia’s weakest kings, men like Stein and
Harden - berg, neither of them a noble, undertook to rebuild a defeated,
occupied, and bankrupt nation, and, in six years, to raise it to the
power and pride that made it, in 1813, the natural leader in the War of
Liberation. Every class joined in the effort: the nobles came forth to
lead the Army, the peasants accepted conscription, the merchants yielded
much of their profits to the state, the men and women of letters and
learning sounded through Germany the call for freedom of the press,
thought, and worship; and in 1807, in a Berlin policed by French troops,
Fichte delivered those famous Addresses to the German Nation which
called for a disciplined minority to lead the Prussian people to moral
cleansing and national renewal. At Konigsberg, in June, 1808, some
university professors organized a “Moral and Scientifi c Union,” which
came to be known as the Tugenbund, or “League of Vir - tue,” dedicated
to the liberation of Prussia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Stein wandered in exile and poverty, and in daily danger of
being captured or shot. In May, 1812, Alexander I invited him to join
the imperial court at St. Petersburg. He went, and there waited, with
his host, for Napoleon to come.</p>
