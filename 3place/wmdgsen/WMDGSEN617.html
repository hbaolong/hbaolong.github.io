<p>1788 — 1824*</p>
<p>I. THE TARNISHED STRAIN: 1066-1809</p>
<p>T O understand Byron we should have to know with some fullness the
history and character of the ancestors whose blood ran like an inter-
mittent fever in his veins. Some of that blood, like his name, may have
come from France, where several Birons were remembered by history; Byron
himself proudly mentioned, in Don Juan (Canto x, line 36), a supposed
progenitor, Radulfus de Burun, as having come over to England with Wil-
liam the Conqueror. In the twelfth century the Buruns became Byrons. A
Sir John Byron served Henry VIII so well that, on the dissolution of the
monasteries, the King transferred to him, for a nominal sum, the abbey
(founded about 1170) and lands of “the late Monastery and Priory of
Newstede… within our County of Nottingham.” 1 A succession of ba -
ronial Byrons thereafter played minor parts in English history,
supporting the Stuart kings, following Charles II into exile, forfeiting
Newstead Abbey, regaining it at the Restoration.</p>
<p>The poet’s great -uncle William, the fifth Lord Byron (1722-98),
hand- some and reckless, served in the Navy; earned the name “Wicked
Lord” by living as a rake in the Abbey; squandered much of his wealth;
killed his relative William Chaworth in an impromptu duel in a darkened
room of a tavern; was sent to the Tower on a charge of murder; was tried
by the House of Lords (1765), was declared “not guilty of murder, but
guilty of manslaughter”; retired to the Abbey, and lived there in somber
isolatio n till his death.</p>
<p>His brother John Byron (1723-86) became a midshipman, suffered ship-
wreck, and published a Narrative from which his grandson took the vivid
shipwreck scene in Don Juan. As commander of the Dolphin John circum-
navigated the globe. Finally he retired to a home in west England, where
he was known as “the Nautical Lover” because he had a wife or a mistress
in every port.</p>
<p>His eldest son, Captain John Byron (1756-91), father of the poet,</p>
<p>crowded so many deviltries into his thirty-five years that he was
called “Mad Jack.” After service in the American colonies he spent some
time in</p>

<p>London, making his mistresses pay his debts. In 1778 he eloped with
the Marchioness of Carmarthen; her husband the Marquess divorced her,
Captain Byron married her and enjoyed her income. She bore him three
child ren, of whom one, Augusta Leigh, became the poet’s half sister and
sometimes mistress.</p>
<p>In 1784 the former Lady Carmarthen died. A year later the dashing</p>
<p>widower married a Scotch girl of twenty years and ^23,000 — Catherine
Gordon of Gight, plain but fiercely proud, with a pedigree going back to
James I of Scotland. When she bore the poet she gave him another line of
distinguished and hectic heredity: French in origin, stormy in
character, with a turn for robbery, murder, and feud. The mother herself
was a medley of wild love and hate. These she spent upon her husband,
who squandered her fortune and then deserted her; and then upon her only
son, whom she pampered with affection, bruised with discipline, and
alienated with such epithets as “lame brat.” Said Childe Harold (i.e.,
Byron), “I</p>
<p>should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.” 2</p>
<p>George Gordon Byron was born in London January 22, 1788. His right
foot, at birth, was deformed by an inward turn of the sole and an upward
tension of the heel. The deformity might have been cured by daily ma-
nipulation of the foot; but the mother had neither the patience nor the
hardihood for a procedure that would have seemed to the child intention-
ally cruel; nor were the physicians inclined to recommend it. By the age
of eight the misshapen foot had so far improved that the boy could wear
a common shoe over an inner shoe designed to balance and diminish the
distortion. In daily life and in sports he became agile on his feet, but
he could not cross a drawing room without painful consciousness of his
limp. In youth he flared up at any mention of His handicap. It shared in
sharpen- ing his sensitivity and temper; but it probably spurred him on
to victories — in swimming, courtship, and poetry — that might divert
attention from his deformity.</p>
<p>In 1789 the mother moved with her child to Aberdeen. A year later her
husband fled to France, where he died in 1791, dissolute and destitute.
Left with only a fragment of her fortune, Mrs. Byron did her best to
give her son an education fit for a lord. She described him fondly, when
he was six, “as a fine boy, and walks and runs as well as any other
child.” 3 At seven he entered Aberdeen Grammar School, where he received
a good grounding in Latin. Through further education and much travel in
Greece, Asia</p>
<p>Minor, and Italy, he became so familiar with Latin and Greek
literature that only an accomplished scholar in classical antiquity can
understand the quo- tations and historical allusions that emerge through
the playfulness of Don Juan. Byron loved history — cleansed of
nationalism and mythology — as the only truth about man; Shelley ignored
it, being wedded to an ideal un- comfortable with history.</p>
<p>In 1798 Byron’s great - uncle, “the Wicked Lord,” died at Newstead,
leav - ing the ten-year-old boy his baronial title, the Abbey, his 3,200
acres, and his</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>debts. These were so profuse that only enough income remained to
enable the widow to move from Aberdeen to the Abbey, and live there in
middle- class comfort. She sent her boy to a school at Dulwich, and, in
1801, to the famous “public” school at Harrow, eleven miles from L
ondon. There he resisted the “fagging” services usually required of the
younger by the older students; and when he himself, as an upper- class
man, used a “fag,” it was with a quite revolutionary courtesy. He was a
troublesome pupil, disrupted discipline, committed pranks, and neglected
the studies assigned; but he did much reading, often of good books, and
rising to Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Berkeley. Apparently he lost his
religious faith, for a fellow student called him a “damned atheist.”
4</p>
<p>At seventeen he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. There he took ex-
pensive quarters, with servants, a dog, and a bear as room-mates. He
patron- ized the local prostitutes and physicians, and occasionally
sought more distinguished service in London. On a vacation at Brighton (
1 808) he kept with him a girl disguised as a boy; but, with due
impartiality, he developed at Cambridge what he described as “a violent,
though pure, love and passion” for a handsome youth. 5 Also, by his
exuberance, generosity, and charm, he made several lasting friendships;
best of all with John Cam Hobhouse, who, almost two years his senior,
contributed some momentary sense and caution to Byron’s often lawless
life. For the young poet seemed bent on ruining him - self with a moral
freedom that would not wait for intelligence to replace the prohibitions
of a lost religious faith.</p>
<p>In June, 1807, aged nineteen, he published a volume of poems — Hours
of Idleness by George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor. He went to London to
arrange for favorable notices of the book. The Edinburgh Review for
Janu- ary, 1 808, greeted it with sarcastic comments on the title as a
pose, and on the signature as an excuse; why had not the adolescent peer
waited a decent time for some measure of maturity?</p>
<p>He reached his majority on January 22, 1809. He paid off the more
pressing of his debts, and incurred more by gambling. He took his seat
in the House of Lords, and suffered under the silence recommended to
novices; but three days later he blasted the critics of his book in
English Bards and Scotch Re- viewers, a clever and slashing satire
imitating, and almost rivaling, Pope’s Dunciad. He ridiculed the
sentimental Romantic movement (of which he was soon to be a leader and a
god), and called for a return to the masculine vigor and classic style
of England’s Augustan Age:</p>
<p>Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;</p>
<p>Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey….</p>
<p>We learn from Horace, “Homer sometimes sleeps” ;</p>
<p>We feel, without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes. 6</p>
<p>Then, after taking his M.A. degree at Cambridge, befriending
pugilists, practicing fencing, and taking an additional course in
London’s night life, he sailed with Hobhouse, July 2, 1809, for Lisbon
and points east.</p>

<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>457</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GRAND TOUR: BYRON, 1809-II</li>
</ol>
<p>It was not traditionally grand: England was at war, and Napoleon con-
trolled France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Italy; so Byron spent
most of his two-year trip in Albania, Greece, and Turkey, with
considerable effect on his politics, his views of women and marriage,
and his death. He left £ 13,000 of debts behind him, and took four
servants with him. He found Lisbon impoverished even beyond wont by the
Peninsular War; every native seemed hostile, and Byron carried two
pistols wherever he went. His party moved on horseback to Seville and
Cadiz, and thence by a British frigate to Gibraltar (where he released
all of his servants except his accustomed valet, William Fletcher), and
on to Malta. There (September i-i8, 1809) he fell in love with
Mrs. Spencer Smith, and so conspicuously that a British captain
commented on his precipitance. Byron sent him a challenge, with an added
flourish: “ As the vessel on which I am to embark must sail with the
first change of wind, the sooner our business is arranged, the better.
Tomorrow at six will be the best hour.” The captain sent his
regrets.</p>
<p>On September 19 Byron and Hobhouse left Malta on the brig Spider. A
week’s sail brought them to Patras. There they went on shore briefly, if
only to set foot on Greek soil; but on the same evening they reboarded
the Spider and continued past Missolonghi and Penelope’s Ithaca, and de
- barked at Preveza, near the Actium so fatal to Anthony and Cleopatra.
Thence they moved north on horseback through Epirus and into Albania,
from whose capital the terrible Turk, Ali Pasha, ruled Albania and
Epirus with sword and style. He accorded Byron all the honors
judiciously due to a British lord; for (he told the poet) he knew him to
be of aristocratic lin- eage by his small hands and ears.</p>
<p>On October 23 Byron and company turned back, and on the 27th they
reached Janina, capital of Epirus. There he began to record his
impressions of his tour in the autobiographical Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage. On Novem- ber 3 the party traveled south through the modern
Aetolia, escorted (by order of the Pasha) by a band of Albanian
mercenaries each noted for his skill in murder and robbery. They fell in
love with their new master, partly because he seemed fearless of death.
When Byron came down with a fever they threatened to kill the doctor if
his patient died; the doctor ran away, and Byron recovered. On November
21 the party took ship from Misso- longhi to Patras; thence, with a new
guard, they proceeded on horseback through the Peloponnesus and Attica,
saw Delphi and Thebes, and entered Athens on Christmas Day of 1 809.</p>
<p>It must have been for the two pilgrims a day of mingled joy and
gloom. The evidences of ancient grandeur and modern decay, and the
apparently humble acceptance of Turkish rule by a once proud people now
reduced from strength to subtlety, and content with the business and
gossip of the</p>
<p>45 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>day, amused Hobhouse but saddened Byron, who incarnated the spirit of
independence and the pride of race. The poet made Childe Harold cry out
for revolt, and thought of how he might help these heirs of greatness to
be free.</p>
<p>In any case their women were beautiful, with their dark, inflammatory
eyes and their yielding grace. Byron and Hobhouse were housed and served
by the widow Macri, who had three daughters, all of them under fifteen.
The young roue learned to feel for them an affection that rejoiced in
their innocence. Apparently it was Theresa, aged twelve, who taught him
the melodious greeting Zoe mou sas agapo — “Life of my life, I love
you.” Around that tender phrase he wrote his famous song: “Maid of
Athens, ere we part, / Give, oh give me back my heart!”</p>
<p>On January 19, 1810, Byron and Hobhouse set out, with a servant and a
guide, and two men to care for the horses, to visit one of the most
inspiring sights in Greece. The ride took them four days, but the end
justified the means: they came in sight of the surviving columns of a
temple to Poseidon raised, in the heroic past, on Sunium Promontorium
(Cape Colonna) to tell mariners that they had sighted Greece. It was in
remembering that shattered perfection, and the seemingly smooth Aegean
far below, that Byron com- posed “The Isle of Greece,” later inserted
into the third canto of Don Juan. From Sunium it was but a day’s rid e
to Marathon, where the poet was moved with feelings that soon took form
in famous lines:</p>
<p>The mountains look on Marathon,</p>
<p>And Marathon looks on the sea;</p>
<p>And musing there an hour alone,</p>
<p>I dreamed that Greece might still be free;</p>
<p>For standing on the Persians’ grave</p>
<p>I could not deem myself a slave.</p>
<p>On March 5 Byron and Hobhouse left Athens on an English vessel, the
Py lades, for Smyrna. Forced to wait there for a month, the poet
completed Canto 11 of Childe Harold. A side trip of three days to
Ephesus revealed the ruins of a city that had lived through three
zeniths — Greek, Christian, and Mohammedan. “The decay of three
religions,” Hobhouse remarked, “is there presented to one view.” 7</p>
<p>On April 1 1 they took passage on the frigate Salsette for
Constantinople. Contrary winds and diplomatic obstructions kept the
vessel anchored for a fortnight at the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles.
Byron and Hobhouse trod the Troad plain, hoping that it covered Homer’s
Ilium, but Schlieman n had not yet been born. On April 1 5 Byron and an
English naval officer, Lieu- tenant William Ekenhead, had themselves
conveyed across the Hellespont to the European side, and then tried to
swim back; but the strength of the current and the coldness of the water
were too much for them. On May 3 they tried again, crossing from Sestos
in European Turkey to Abydos in Asia Minor; Ekenhead accomplished the
feat in sixty-five minutes, Byron in seventy. At that point the channel
is one mile wide, but the current forced the new Leanders to swim over
four miles. 8</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>The tourists reached Constantinople on May 12, admired the mosques,
and left on July 14. On the 17 th their vessel anchored in the harbor of
Zea on the island of Keos, where they parted; Hobhouse continued to
London, Byron and Fletcher changed to a boat bound for Patras. Again
they crossed overland to Athens. There Byron resumed his long inquiry
into feminine differences; he boasted of his conquests, contracted
gonorrhea, and adopted melancholy as a career. On November 26 he wrote
to Hobhouse: “I have now seen the world…. I have tested all sorts of
pleasure;… I have nothing more to hope, and may begin to consider the
most eligible way of walking out of it…. I wish I could find some of
Socrates’ Hemlock.” 9 In January, 181 1, he took rooms for himself and
some servants in a Capuchin monastery at the foot of the Acropolis, and
dreamt of monastic peace.</p>
<p>On April 22 he left Athens for the last time, stayed a month in
Malta, and went on to England. He reached it on July 14, two years and
twelve days after leaving it. While busy renewing contacts in London he
received news that his mother had died, aged forty-six. He rushed up to
Newstead Abbey, and spent a night sitting in the dark beside her corpse.
When a maid begged him to retire to his room, he refused, saying, “I had
but one friend in the world, and she is gone !” He had said the same
thing in an epitaph for his Newfoundland dog Boatswain, who had died in
November, 1808, and had been buried in the Abbey garden vault:</p>
<p>To mark a friend’s remains these stones arise;</p>
<p>I never had but one, — and here he lies.</p>
<p>In August, 181 1, Byron drew up a will entailing the Abbey to his
cousin George Byron, specifying gifts for his servants, and leaving
directions for his burial: “I desire that my body may be buried in the
vault of the garden of Newstead, without any ceremony or burial service
whatever, and that no inscription, save my name and age, be written on
the tomb tablet; and it is my will that my faithful dog may not be
removed from the said vault.” 10 Having arranged his death, he proceeded
to conquer London.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE LION OF LONDON: BYRON, 1811-14</li>
</ol>
<p>He made friends readily, for he was attractive in person and manners,
fascinating in conversation, widely informed in literature and history,
and more faithful to his friends than to his mistresses. He took rooms
at 8 St. James’s Street, where he welcomed Thomas Moore, Thomas
Campbell, Sam - uel Rogers, Hobhouse… ; and they welcomed him in turn.
Through Rogers and Moore he entered the famous circle at Holland House.
There he met Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was declining in political
influence, but had not lost his conversational flair. “When he talked,”
Byron recalled, “we listened, without one yawn, from six till one in the
morning…. Poor fel- low! he got drunk very thoroughly and very soon. It
occasionally fell to my lot to convey him home.” 11</p>
<p>460</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Stimulated by these Whiggish wits, Byron took up the cause of the
“Lud - dite” frame -breakers of Nottinghamshire, his own county. On
February 20, 1812, the Commons passed a bill condemning any captured
frame-breaker to death. The measure moved to the House of Lords, and on
February 27 Byron rose to speak against it. He had written his address
in advance, in ex- cellent English, and he began in a tone of modesty
expected of a maiden speech. He admitted that some workers had been
guilty of violence involv- ing considerable losses to property, and that
the shattered machines might in the long run have been a boon to the
national economy; but meanwhile they had thrown out of work hundreds of
men who had through time and labor acquired a skill suddenly made
useless to them in supporting their families; they were now reduced to
poverty and charity, and their despair and bitterness could be gauged
from their violence. As he proceeded the young orator lost caution and
support by attacking the war as the source of unprecedented misery among
English laborers. The Lords frowned, and passed the bill. On April 2 1
Byron made a second speech, denouncing Brit- ish rule in Ireland, and
called for the emancipation of Catholics throughout the British Empire;
the Lords praised his eloquence, rejected his plea, and set him down as
a political innocent useless to his party. He abandoned poli- tics, and
decided to plead his case through poetry.</p>
<p>Twelve days after his maiden speech the first two cantos of Childe
Harold’s Pilgrimage were offered to the public. Their almost
unprecedented success — the first edition (five hundred copies) sold out
in three days — encouraged the author to believe that he had found a
medium more enduring than foren- sic speech. Now he made the exuberant
remark “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.” 12 Even his old
enemies at the Edinburgh Review praised mm, and, in gratitude, he sent
an apology to Jeffrey for having bruised him in English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers.</p>
<p>Almost every door was now opened to him; almost every prominent host-
ess invited him; a dozen women, warming to his handsome face, fluttered
about him, hoping to snare the young lion in their varied charms. They
were not repelled by his reputation for sexual voracity, and his lordly
title made him seem a precious prize to those who did not know his
debts. He enjoyed their attentions, being readily excited by their
mysterious radiation. “There is,” he said, “something to me very
softening in the presence of a woman — some strange influence, even if
one is not in love with them — which I cannot account for, having no
very high opinion of the sex.” 13 Despite all his skeptical intelligence
he succumbed again and again to the magnet that every healthy woman is
to any healthy man.</p>
<p>One of his first conquerors was Lady Caroline Lamb (1785-1828).</p>
<p>Daughter of the third Earl of Bessborough, she married, at twenty,
William Lamb, second son of Lord and Lady Melbourne. After reading
Childe Har- old’s Pilgrimage she resolved to meet the author; but on
being presented to him she took fright an d quickly turned away from him
as “dangerous to know.” The rejection stimulated him; when they met
again “he begged per - mission to see me.” He came. She was three years
his senior and already a</p>

<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>mother; but she made herself pleasant and fragrant, and she was
heiress to a great fortune. He came again, almost every day. Her
husband, busy with his own affairs, accepted him as the British
equivalent of an Italian cavaliere servente. She grew more and more
attracted to him; went to his rooms, openly or dressed as a page; she
wrote him passionately amorous letters. For a time his temperature rose
with hers, until he proposed to elope with her; 14 but when her mother
and her husband took her off to Ireland (September,</p>
<p>1812), he readily resigned himself, and was soon entangled in a
liaison with Lady Oxford.</p>
<p>Amid such exaltations Byron kept some stability by writing rapidly,
in fluent verse, a series of Oriental tales of adventure, violence, and
love. They made no pretense to greatness; they were romantic
imaginations, echoing the</p>
<p>? &gt;oet’s travels in Albania, Epirus, and Greece; they required
little thought rom the author, and none from the reader, and sold
excitingly well. First came The Giaour, in March, 1813; soon, in
December, The Bride of Aby- dos, of which six thousand copies were
bought in a month; better still, The Corsair (January, 1814), which
shattered all precedents by selling ten thou- sand copies on the day of
its publication; then Lara (1815) and The Siege of Corinth (1816). The
publisher gathered his guineas, and offered a share to Byron, who, proud
as a lord, refused to take payment for his poems.</p>
<p>Even while composing these tales of dashing outlaws, the author was
wearying of his lawless life. He could not go on philandering until he
had worn out his health, his welcome, and his funds. He and Hobhouse had
vowed to shun marriage as a prison of the spirit as well as the flesh;
now he wondered whether marriage might not be a necessary mooring for
desires which, let loose, could derange not only the individual but
society itself. He felt that he might be persuaded to surrender his
freedom for stability and calm, or for a surer income than his crumbling
Abbey could provide.</p>
<p>Annabella Milbanke seemed to meet all his requirements. She had
beauty and education, and was the only child of a substantial fortune.
When he first met her, March 25, 1812, at the home of her aunt, Lady
Melbourne, he was favorably impressed: “Her features were small and
feminine, though not regular. She had the fairest skin imaginable. Her
figure was perfect for her height, and there was a simplicity, a retired
modesty about her,… that interested me exceedingly.” 15 He did not speak
to her, for each waited for the other to take the initiative. But she
too was interested, for in her diary and letters she spent some time
analyzing his character: “Acrimony of spirit,… dissimulant, the violence
of its scorn…. Sincere and independent…. It is said that he is an
infidel, and I think it probable from the general character of his mind.
His poem [Childe Harold ] sufficientlyproves that he can feel nobly, but
he has disc ouraged his own goodness.” 16 This was a per - ceptive
phrase; perhaps the thought came to her how interesting, though
dangerous, it would be to try to save this sensitive man from his
senses, to release his shy virtues, and, incidentally, to capture the
young lion of Lon- don from all those women who were enthralled by his
scandalous reputation. Months passed, during which Lady Caroline Lamb
held the stage. Then</p>
<p>462 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>hat flame was cooled by the Irish Channel; and on September 13, 1812,
By- ron wrote to Lady Melbourne a strange letter that opened a fatal
direction in his life: “I was, am, and shall be, I fear, attached to…
one to whom I never said much, but have never lost sight of;… one whom I
wished to marry, had not this [Lamb] affair intervened…. The woman I
mean is Miss Milbanke…. I never saw a woman whom I esteemed so much.” 17
Lady Melbourne, well pleased, told her niece of Byron’s confession, and
asked would she consider a proposal. On October 12 Miss Milbanke sent a
reply worthy of Talleyrand:</p>
<p>Believing that he never will be the object of that strong affection
which would make me happy in domestic life, I should wrong him by any
measure that might, even indirectly, confirm his present impressions.
From my limited observation of his conduct, I am predisposed to believe
your strong testimony in his favour, and I willingly attribute it more
to the defect of my own feelings than of his character, that I am not
inclined to return his attachment. After this statement, which I make
with real sorrow from the idea of its giving pain, I must leave our
future intercourse to his judgement. I can have no reason for
withdrawing from an acquaintance that does me honour and is capable of
im- parting so much rational pleasure, except the fear of involuntarily
deceiving him. 18</p>
<p>Byron, who had not felt any basic urge toward this learned and con-
scientious lady, took the refusal amiably, and readily found comfort in
the arms of the Countess of Oxford, then of Lady Frances Webster, and,
con- currently, of his half sister Augusta Leigh. Born in 1783, she was
her half brother’s elder by five years. She had now (1813) be en six
years married to her first cousin, Colonel George Leigh, and had three
children. At this junc- ture she came to London from her home in Six
Mile Bottom, Cambridgeshire, to ask Byron’s financial help in
difficulties caused by her husband’s losses, and prolonged absences, at
racetracks. Byron could not give her much, for his income was
precarious, but he entertained her with genial conversation, and
discovered that she was a woman.</p>
<p>She was thirty; not quite the jemme de trente ans that Balzac
praised, for she lacked intellectual background and vivacity; but she
was affectionate, accommodating, perhaps a bit awed by her brother’s
fame, and inclined to give him whatever she could command. Her long
separation from him, added to her husband’s neglect, left her
emotionally free. Byron, who had rashly discarded any moral taboo that
had not met the test of his young rea- son, wondered why he should not
mate with his sister, as the Pharaohs had done. Later developments
indicate that he now, or soon, had sexual relations with Augusta. 19 In
August of this year 1813 he thought of taking her with him on a
Mediterranean voyage. 20 That plan fell through, but in January he took
her to Newstead Abbey. When, on April 15, 1814, Augusta gave birth to a
daughter, Byron wrote to Lady Melbourne that “if it is an ape, that must
be my fault”; the child herself, Medora Leigh, came to believe herself
his daughter. 21 In May he sent Augusta three thousand pounds to clear
her husband’s debts. In July he was with her in Hastings. In August he
took her to his Abbey.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>463</p>
<p>While he was becoming more and more deeply involved with his half
sister, Miss Milbanke was sending him letters whose rising cordiality
prompted him to write in his j ournal under December 1 , 1813:</p>
<p>Yesterday a very pretty letter from Annabella, which I answered. What
an odd situation and friendship is ours! — without one spark of love on
either side…. She is a very superior woman, and very little spoiled,
which is strange in an heiress — a girl of twenty — a peeress that is to
be, in her own right — an only child, and a savante, who has always had
her own way. She is a poetess — a mathematician, a metaphysician, and
yet, withal, very kind, generous, and gen- tle, with very little
pretension. Any other head would be turned with her acquisitions, and a
tenth of her advantages. 22</p>
<p>As if she had read this astonishing tribute, her letters in 1814
became increas- ingly tender, assuring him that she was heart-free,
asking for his picture, and signing herself “Affectionately.” Melting in
her epistolary warmth, he wrote</p>
<p>He approached his fate in alternating order: fear that he was losing
the liberty that he had become accustomed to in friendship, sex, and
ideas; hope that marriage would rescue him from an entangling web of
dangerous and degrading alliances. He explained to his friends: “I must,
of course, reform, reform thoroughly…. She is so good a person.” And to
his fiancee: “I wish to be good…. I am whatever you please to make me.”
24 She accepted her task piously. To Emily Milner she wrote, about
October 4, 1 8 14:</p>
<p>It is not in the great world that Lord Byron’s true character must be
sought; but ask of those nearest to him — of the unhappy whom he has
consoled, of the poor whom he has blessed, of the dependents to whom he
has been the best of masters. For his despondency I fear I am too
answerable for the last two years. I have a calm and deep security — a
confidence in God and man. 25</p>
<p>As the time came for Byron to go to Annabella’s family at Seaham
(near Durham) and claim her in marriage, his courage sank. He tarried on
the way at Augusta’s home, and there wrote a letter to his fiancee
withdrawing from the engagement. Augusta persuaded him to destroy the
letter, 26 and to accept marriage as a saving tie. On October 29 he
continued to Seaham, with Hobhouse, who noted in his diary: “Never was
lover less in haste.” The bridegroom found the bride’s family cordial,
put on his best manners to please them, and, on January 2, 1 8 1 5, led
her to the altar.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>TRIAL BY MARRIAGE: BYRON, 1815-16</li>
</ol>
<p>After the ceremony they rode on a gloomy winter day to a honeymoon at
Halnaby Hall, in a suburb of Durham. He was now nearing twenty-seven,
she was twenty-three. He had had eight or more years of irresponsible
and</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>almost promiscuous sex, and had seldom associated coitus with love.
Accord- ing to Moore’s report of a passage he had seen in Byron’s
memoirs (burned in 1824), the husband did not wait for the night to
shroud their consum- mation; he “ had Lady Byron on the sofa before
dinner on the day of their marriage.” 27 After dinner, if w e may trust
his recollection, he asked her whether she intended to sleep in the same
bed with him, and added, “I hate sleeping with any woman, but you may if
you choose.” 28 He accommodated</p>
<p>but it was another person’s secret…. I asked… if [Augusta] knew</p>
<p>it. He appeared terrified.” 31 However, Annabella seems to have had
no sus - picion of Augusta at this time.</p>
<p>After three weeks at Halnaby Hall the newlyweds returned to Seaham
for a stay with the Milbanke family. Byron adjusted himself and became
popu- lar with everybody, including his wife. After six weeks of this he
began to long for the excitement of London and the voices of his
friends. Annabella agreed. In London they settled in luxurious rooms at
1 3 Piccadilly Terrace. On the day after their arrival Hobhouse came and
Byron recovered his good humor. “For ten days,” his wife related, “he
was kinder than I had ever seen him.” 32 Perhaps in gratitude, or
fearing loneliness, she invited Augusta to spend some time with them.
Augusta came in April, 1815, and stayed till June. On June 20 George
Ticknor, the American historian of Spanish litera- ture, visit ed the
new menage, and gave a quite favorable report of Byron’s behavior. On
that occasion an uncle of Annabella entered joyfully with the news that
Napoleon had just been defeated at Waterloo. “I’m damned sorry for it,”
said Byron.</p>
<p>He resumed the writing of poetry. In April, 1815, he joined two
Jewish composers in issuing Hebrew Melodies, of which they had written
the mu- sic and he the words. The collaboration, despite the guinea
price, soon sold ten thousand copies. Murray brought out an edition of
the poems alone, and this too found a wide sale. In October Byron
finished The Siege of Corinth; Lady Byron made the fair copy for the
printer. “Annabella,” Byron told Lady Blessington, “had a degree of self
-control that I never saw equaled…. T his produced an opposite effect on
me.” 33</p>
<p>He had some excuse for irritability. Assuming that he had sold
Newstead Abbey, he had taken expensive lodgings for himself and his
wife, and had spent lavishly in furnishing them; but the sale fell
through, and Byron found himself literally besieged. In November, 1815,
a bailiff entered the apart- ment, placed attachments on some furniture,
and threatened to spend the night there until Byron pai d his bills.
Annabella’s rich parents, Byron felt,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXl) THE REBEL POETS 465</p>
<p>should have contributed more generously to the expenses of the new
menage.</p>
<p>His worries tinged even his spells of tenderness with bitterness or
gloom. “If any woman could have rendered marriage endurable to me,” he
told his wife, “you would.” But then, “I believe you will go on loving
me until I beat you.” When she expressed the hope and faith that he
would learn to love her, he repeated, “It is too late now. If y ou had
taken me two years ago… But it is my destiny to ruin all I come near.”
34 Having accepted a place on the governing board of the Drury Lane
Theatre, he joined Sheridan and others in much drinking, and took one of
the actresses to bed. 35 Annabella appealed to Augusta to come again and
help her manage him; Augusta came (November 15, 1815), reproved her
brother, and found herself joined with Annabella as victim of his rage.
“Augusta was filled with pity for her sister - in- law.” 36</p>
<p>Through most of those difficult months Lady Byron had been carrying
his child. On December 10, 1815, she gave birth to a daughter, who was
named Augusta Ada — later just Ada. Byron rejoiced, and became fond of
the infant, and, passingly, of the mother. “My wife,” he told Hobhouse
in that month, “is perfection itself— the best creature breathing. But
mind what I say — don’t marry.” 37 Soon after Ada’s birth his furies
returned. In one tantrum he threw into the fireplace a precious watch
which he had carried since boyhood, and then shattered it with a poker.
38 On January 3, 18 16, ac- cording to Annabella’s account to her
father, Byron came to her room and talked with “considerable violence”
of his affairs wi th women of the thea- ter. On January 8 she consulted
Dr. Matthew Baillie as to Byron’s sanity; he came, watched the caged
poet, but declined to give an opinion.</p>
<p>Apparently Byron consented that Annabella should go, with her child,
for a stay with her mother, Lady Milbanke, nee Noel, at the Noel
property in Kirkby, Leicestershire. Early on January 15 she left with
Ada while Byron was still asleep. At Woburn she stopped to send him a
strange hortatory but inviting note:</p>
<p>Dearest B: The child is quite well and the best of travellers. I hope
you are good, and remember my prayers and injunctions. Don’t give
yourself up to the abominable trade of versifying — nor to brandy — nor
to anything or any- body that is not lawful and right. Though / disobey
in writing to you, let me hear of your obedience at Kirkby. Ada’s love
to you, and mine.</p>
<p>Pip 39</p>
<p>From Kirkby she wrote again, humorously and affectionately, telling
him that her parents were looking forward to seeing him. On the same day
she wrote to Aug usta (who was still with Byron) with Lady Milbanke’s
recom - mendation that she should dilute Byron’s laudanum (opium) with
three - quarters water.</p>
<p>Gradually, then fully, Annabella told her parents how, in her view,
By- ron had treated her. Shocked, they insisted on her complete
separation from her husband. Lady Milbanke rushed down to London to
consult a medical examiner who had watched Byron’s behavior; if she
could establish Byron’s</p>
<p>4 66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xinsanity the marriage might be annulled without Byron’s consent. The
ex - aminer reported that he had seen no signs of insanity in the poet,
but had heard of some neurotic outbreaks, as when Byron was seized by a
con- vulsive fit in his enthusiasm over the acting of Edmund Kean.
Annabella sent a caution to her mother not to involve Augusta Leigh in
the matter, for Augusta had been “the truest of friends to me…. I very
much fear that she may be supposed the cause of separation by many, and
it would be a cruel injustice.” 40</p>
<p>On February 2, 1816, Annabella’s father, Sir Ralph Milbanke,
dispatched to Byron a proposal for peaceful separation. The poet replied
courteously that he saw no reason why the wife who had so recently sent
him messages of affection should have so completely changed her mind. He
wrote to Annabella, asking if she had freely agreed to her father’s
action. She was moved to “distress and agony” by his letter, but her
parents refused to let her reply. Augusta added her own appeal for
reconsideration; to which Annabella replied: “I will only recall to Lord
Byron’s mind his avowed in - surmountable aversion to the married life,
and the desire and determination he has expressed, ever since its
commencement, to free himself from that bondage, as finding it quite
insupportable.” 41</p>
<p>On February 12 Hobhouse went to see Byron. On the way he heard some
of the gossip circulating in London’s social and liter ary circles, and
implying that Byron had been brutal and unfaithful to his wife. Some
items from Hobhouse’s diary for that day:</p>
<p>Saw Mrs. L[eigh] and George B[yron, the poet’s cousin], and from
them</p>
<p>I now thought it my duty to tell Byron I had changed my opinion….
When I told him what 1 had heard in the streets that day he was
astounded — he had heard he was to be accused of cruelty, drunkenness,
and infidelity — 1 got him to own much of what 1 had been told in the
morning — he was dreadfully agitated —said he was ruined and would blow
out his brains…. Sometimes says, “and yet she loved me once,” and at
other times that he is glad to be rid of such a woman — he said if I
would go abroad he would separate at once. 42 About this time Byron
received a bill for two thousand pounds for the coach he had bought for
himself and his wife. He could not meet the debt, and had only one
hundred fifty available; yet, with his characteristically reckless
generosity, about February 16, 1816, he sent a hundred pounds to
Coleridge.</p>
<p>On February 22 Annabella came to London and gave to Dr. Stephen
Lushington an account that in his judgment made separation necessary. In
that week public gossip mentioned Mrs. Leigh, and accused Byron of
sodomy. He perceived that any further refusal of a quiet separation
would</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>bring a court action in which Augusta would be irrevocably ruined. On
March 9 he gave his consent, and offered to resign all rights to his
wife’s for - tune, which had been bringing the couple a thousand pounds
a year; she agreed that half of this sum should be paid to him annually.
She promised to publicly renew her friendship with Augusta, and she kept
that promise. She did not seek a divorce.</p>
<p>Soon after the separation he composed a poem — “Fare thee well, and
if for ever, / Still fare thee well”— and sent it to her. A group of his
friends — Hobhouse, Scrope Davies, Leigh Hunt, Samuel Rogers, Lord
Holland, Ben- jamin Constant — came to his rooms to make him forget the
collapse of his marriage. Alone and uninvited, Godwin’s stepdaughter
“Claire” Clairmont brought him word of admiration from a rival poet,
Percy Shelley, and of- fered her person as a balm for his wounds. He
accepted her offer, opening a long concatenation of new griefs. On April
25, 1816, with three servants and a personal physician, he sailed for
Ostend, never to see England again.</p>
<p>V. THE YOUTH OF SHELLEY: 1 792 — 1 8 1 1</p>
<p>Percy commended his grandfather, Sir Bysshe Shelley, for having
“acted</p>
<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley was bom on August 4, 1792, at the family
property known as Field Place — a spacious home and estate near Horsham
in Sussex. Four sisters were born later, and much later a brother. Percy
was brought up in close companionship with his sisters; he may have
taken from them some habits of tenderness, excitability, and
imagination; and for the eldest of them he developed an intense
affection.</p>
<p>At Eton he suffered agonies of injured pride from fagging. He shunned
most sports except rowing; fatefully he never learned to swim. He was
soon proficient in Latin, and changed bullies into friends by helping
them with their lessons. His extracurricular reading included many tales
of mystery and terror, but also he relished the materialism of
Lucretius’ De rerum mtura,</p>
<p>4 68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>anarchism of Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. This
book, he later wrote, “opened my mind to fresh and more extensive views;
it materi - ally influenced my character; I rose from its perusal a
wiser and better man…. I beheld that I had duties to perform.” 45</p>
<p>During vacations he fell in love, aged sixteen, with a cousin,
Harriet</p>
<p>Grove, who often visited Field Place. They began a correspondence
whose ardor raised them in 1809 to mutual pledges of eternal fidelity.
But he con- fessed to her his doubts about God; she showed his agnostic
letter to her father, who advised her to set Percy adrift. When, in
January, 18 11, Har- riet transferred her troth to William Helyer,
Shelley wrote to his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg a letter worthy of
Byron’s wildest heroes: “She is no longer mine, she abhors me as a
deist, as what she was before. Oh! Chris- tianity, when I pardon this
last, this severest of thy persecutions, may God (if there be a God)
blast me!… Is suicide wrong? I slept with a loaded pistol and some
poison last night, but did not die.” 46</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1810) he had passed from Eton to University College, Ox-
ford. He avoided there, except for an exploratory night or two, 47 the
sexual riot that seemed to most undergraduates a necessary course to
manhood. He listened now and then to lectures by the dons, who kept only
a step ahead of him in Latin and Greek; soon he was composing Latin
poetry, and he never forgot Aeschylus. His quarters were disordered with
scattered books and manuscripts, and the abracadabra of amateur science;
in one experiment he nearly blew up his room. He trusted to science to
remake the world and man. He did not care for history, having taken the
word of Voltaire and Gibbon that it was mainly the record of the crimes
and follies of mankind; nevertheless he read these two skeptics fondly.
He thought that he had found an answer to the riddle of the universe in
Lucretius and the philo- sophes: it was a choreography of atoms
following necessary laws. Then he discovered Spinoza, and interpreted
him as a monistic dualist who saw matter and mind as two aspects of one
divine substance — a something like mind in all matter, and a something
like matter clothing all mind.</p>
<p>He read passionately. His classmate Hogg described him as “having a
book in hand at all hours; reading… at table, in bed, and especially
during a walk… not only at Oxford… in High Street, but in the most
crowded thoroughfares of London…. I never beheld eyes that devoured the
pages more voraciously.” 48 Eating seemed to him a waste of time, if
unaccom -</p>
<p>f tanied by reading; and the simplest food was best, if only as least
distracting rom the digestion of ideas. He was not yet a vegetarian, but
bread in one pocket and raisins in another seemed to him a well-balanced
meal. However, he had a sweet tooth, savored honey on gingerbread, and
liked to adorn his drinking water with wine. 49</p>
<p>He is represented to us, in his Oxford days, as a tall, slender,
stooping bundle of nerves, theories, and arguments; careless of his
dress and hair; shirt collarless and open at the throat; face almost
femininely fair; eyes bril- lian t but resdess; manners awkward but
courteous. He had a poet’s organism, sensitive at every nerve end, warm
with unchecked feelings, receptive to a</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>chaos of ideas, but allergic to history. He had a poet’s moral code,
naturally</p>
<p>On that subject the young rebels concocted a collaboration which they
entitled The Necessity of Atheism. That term was then proscribed in
polite society; gentlemen skeptics called themselves deists, and spoke
respectfully of God as an unknowable spirit, inherent in nature as its
life and mind. Shelley himself would later come to this view; but, in
brave and uncalculating youth, the authors preferred to call themselves
atheists as a challenge to a taboo and a call to attention. The argument
of the essay was that neither our senses nor reason nor history reveal a
God. The senses reveal only matter in motion according to law. Reason
rejects the idea of a creator evoking the universe out of nothing.
History offers no example of divine action, nor of a divine person
appearing on the earth. The authors did not sign their names, but, on
the title page, ascribed it to, “Through deficiency of proof. An
Atheist.”</p>
<p>The Oxford University and City Herald for February 9, 181 1,
contained an advertisement for the pamphlet. It appeared on February 13,
and Shelley at once placed copies of it in the window or on the counter
of an Oxford bookstore. The Reverend John Walker, fellow of New College,
saw the dis- play, and called upon the bookseller to destroy all copies
of it in his posses- sion; this was done. Meanwhile Shelley had sent
copies to many bishops, and to several university dignitaries. 50 One of
these brought the pamphlet to the master and fellows of University
College. These summoned Shelley to appear before them on March 25. He
came, was shown the pamphlet, and was asked was he the author. He
refused to answer, and made an appeal for freedom of thought and the
press. He was told to leave Oxford by the next morning. Hearing of this,
Hogg confessed himself co-author, and asked for equal punishment; it was
granted. That afternoon a college bulletin an- nounced that Shelley and
Hogg were being expelled “for contumacy in refusing to answer certain
questions put to them/’ Privately the master sent word to Shelley that
if it should prove difficult for him to leave at such short notice, a
request for a few days’ delay would be granted. The message was ignored.
On March 26 Shelley and Hogg proudly left on the top of the coach for
London.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ELOPEMENT I: SHELLEY, l8ll-12</li>
</ol>
<p>They took rooms at 1 5 Poland Street. Shelley’s father, in town for a
ses - sion of Parliament, came to them there, and appealed to them to
renounce their views. Finding Shelley unmoved, he bade him dismiss Hogg
as an evil influence, return to the family home, and stay there “under
such gentleman</p>
<p>470</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>as I shall appoint, and attend to his instructions and directions.”
Shelley re - fused. The father departed in anger and despair. He
recognized Shelley’s abilities, and had looked forward to his taking an
honorable place in Parlia- ment. Hogg left for York to study law. Soon
Shelley’s funds ran out. His sisters, then studying at Mrs. Fenning’s
School in the Clapham district of London, sent him their pocket money.
In May his father relented, and agreed to allow him £ 200 a year.</p>
<p>Among his sisters’ fellow students at Clapham was sixteen -year-old
Har- riet Westbrook, daughter of the prosperous owner of a tavern in
Grosvenor Square. When she met Percy she was awed by his pedigree, his
fluency of language, the range of his studies, the fascinating, deviltry
of his views. She soon agreed that God was dead and that laws were
unnecessary nuisances. She read with fond tremors the rebel texts he
lent her, and the translated classics revealing a wonderful civilization
that had never heard of Christ. She invited him to her home. “I spend
most of my time at Miss West - brook’s,” Shelley wrote to Hogg in May,
18 n. “She is reading Voltaire’s Dictionnaire philosophique.” 61 When
her schoolmates discovered that her strange friend was an atheist they
boycotted her as already smelling of hell. When she was caught with a
letter from him she was expelled.</p>
<p>Early in August Shelley reported to Hogg: “Her father has
persecuted</p>
<p>Harriet and Eliza, with Hogg nearby, stayed in York while Shelley
went to London to soften his father. Mr. Shelley had stopped his
allowance on hearing of the elopement; now he renewed it, but forbade
his son ever to enter the family home. Returning to York, Shelley found
that his dear friend Hogg had attempted to seduce Harriet. She said
nothing of this to her hus- band, but Hogg confessed, was forgiven, and
departed. In November the trio left for Keswick, where Shelley became
acquainted with Southey.</p>

<p>“Here,” wrote Southey (January 4, 1812), “is a man who acts upon me
as my own ghost would do. He is just what I was in 1794…. I told him
that all the difference between us is that he is nineteen and I am
thirty- seven.” 86 Shelley found Southey amiable and generous, and read
the older man’s poetry with pleasure. A few days later he wrote: “I do
not think as highly of Southey as I did. It is to be confessed that to
see him in his family… he appears in a most amiable light…. How he is
corrupted by the world, con- taminated by custom; it rends my heart when
I think what he might have been.” 57</p>
<p>He found some balm in reading Godwin’s Political Justice. When he</p>
<p>learned that this once famous philosopher was now living in poverty
and obscurity, he wrote to him a letter of worship:</p>
<p>I had enrolled your name in the list of the honorable dead. I had
felt regret that the glory of your being had passed from this earth of
ours. It is not so. You still live, and, I firmly believe, are planning
the welfare of human kind. I have just but entered on the scene of human
operations, yet my feelings and my reasonings correspond with what yours
were…. I am young; I am ardent in the cause of philosophy and truth….
When I come to London I shall seek for you. I am convinced I could
represent myself to you in such terms as not to be thought unworthy of
your friendship….</p>
<p>Adieu. I shall earnestly await your answer. 58</p>
<p>Godwin’s reply is lost; but we may judge its tenor from his letter of
March, 1812: “As far as I can yet penetrate into your character, I
conceive it to exhibit an extraordinary assemblage of lovely qualities,
not without con- siderable defects. The defects do and always have
arisen chiefly from this source — that you are still very young, and
that in certain essential respects you do not sufficiently perceive that
you are so.” He advised Shelley not to publish every ebullition, and, if
he published anything, not to put his name to it. “The life of a man who
does this [publishes and signs] will be a series of retractions.” 89</p>
<p>Shelley had already practiced restraint by keeping in manuscript, or
in some privately printed copies, his first important composition —
Queen Mab. “It was written by me at the age of eighteen— I dare say in a
sufficiently in- temperate spirit — but… was not intended for
publication.” 60 In 1810 he was still aflame with the French
philosophes; he prefaced the poem with Voltaire’s angry motto Rcrasez
I’infdme!, and he borrowed many ideas from Volney’s Les Ruines, ou
Meditations sur les revolutions des empires (1791).</p>
<p>As the poem begins, the maiden Ian the is asleep. In a dream the
Fairy Queen Mab comes down to her from the sky, takes her up to the
stars, and asks her to contemplate, from that perspective, the past,
present, and future of the earth. A succession of empires passes before
her — Egypt, Palmyra, Judea, Greece, Rome… Leaping to the present, the
Queen pictures a king (obvious ly the Prince Regent) who is “a slave
even to the basest appetites”; 61 she wonders that not one of the
wretches who famish while he feasts “raises an arm to dash him from the
throne”; and she adds a now famous verdict:</p>
<p>47 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>The man</p>
<p>Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.</p>
<p>Power, like a desolating pestilence,</p>
<p>Pollutes whate’er it touches. 62</p>
<p>The Queen also dislikes commerce and Adam Smith: “the harmony and
happiness of man yields to the wealth of nations”; “all things are sold,
even love.” 63 She pictures the burning of an atheist; this frightens
Ianthe; the Queen comforts her by assuring her, “There is no God.” 64
Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew, enters, and berates the God of Genesis for
punishing bil- lions of men, women, and children through thousands of
years for one woman’s unintelligible sin. 65 (Byron may have found
suggestions here for his Cain; Shelley had sent him a privately printed
copy.) Finally the Queen pic- tures a rosy future: love unbound by law,
prisons empty and needless, pros- titution gone, death without pain.
Then she bids Ianthe return to the earth, preach the gospel of universal
love, and have undiscourageable faith in its victory. Ianthe awakes. —
It is a powerful poem, despite its juvenile thought and sometimes
bombastic style; in any case a remarkable product for a lad of eighteen
years. When, without the poet’s consent, Queen Mab was pub - lished in
1821, the radicals of England welcomed it as their plaint and dream.
Within twenty years fourteen editions were issued by piratical firms.
66</p>
<p>After a stay (February-March, 1812) in Ireland, where, with heroic
im- partiality, he worked for both Catholic and proletarian causes,
Shelley and Harriet passed into Wales. Oppressed by the poverty there,
they went to London to raise funds for Welsh charities. He took this
opportunity to pay his respects to Godwin, who was so pleased with him
that the two families frequently played host to each other. After short
return visits to Ireland and Wales, the younger couple settled in
London. There, March 24, 1814, to insure the legitimacy of any son and
heir they might have, Shelley and Har- riet were remarried, now by a
Church of England rite. Some time before, on her birthday, he had
addressed to her a poetic renewal of his vows:</p>
<p>Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve;</p>
<p>But ours shall not be mortal!…</p>
<p>Virtue and Love! unbending Fortitude,</p>
<p>Freedom, Devotedness, and Purity!</p>
<p>That life my spirit consecrates to you. 87</p>

<li>ELOPEMENT II: SHELLEY, l8l2-l6</li>
</ol>
<p>Through all his wanderings Shelley seems never to have thought of
earn- ing his own living. Perhaps he shared Wordsworth’s view that a
dedicated</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>selling “post - obits” to moneylenders; so, in 1813, he pledged two
thousand pounds of his expected inheritance in exchange for six hundred
in hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the moneylenders were encouraged by his frail physique and
recurrent illnesses. A constant pain in his left side (his second wife
would report) “wound up his nerves to a pitch of sensibility that
rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the
enjoyment of healthy sensations. Perfectly gentle and forbearing in
manner, he suffered a good deal of irrita- bility, or rather excitement,
and his fortitude to bear was almost always on a stretch.” 68</p>
<p>He thought he might ease his pains by a vegetarian diet. He was con-
firmed in this hope by ejmeriments described in John Newton’s Return to
Nature, or Defence of a Vegetable Regimen (1811). By 1812 he and Har-
riet were confirmed vegetarians. By 1813 he was so enthusiastic about
what she called “the Pythagorean system” 09 that he interpolated in his
notes to Queen Mab an appeal to all and sundry:</p>
<p>By all that is sacred in our hope for the human race, I conjure those
who love happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable
system!… There is no disease, bodily or mental, which adoption of a
vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated, wherever the
experiment has been tried. Debility is gradually converted into
strength, disease into healthfulness. 70</p>
<p>In Vindication of Natural Diet (1813) he traced man’s evil impulses,
and most wars, to a meat diet, and pleaded for a return from commerce
and in- dustry to agriculture:</p>
<p>On a natural system of diet we should require no spices from India,
no wines from Portugal, Spain, France, or Madeira…. The spirit of the
nation, that should take the lead in this great reform, would insensibly
become agricultural; commerce, with all its vices, selfishness, and
corruption, would gradually de- cline; more natural habits would produce
gentler manners. 71</p>
<p>A strange concatenation of circumstances led from his vegetarianism
to the breakup of his first marriage. Through his admiration for John
Newton he met Newton’s sister -in-law, Mrs. John Boynton, a vegetarian,
a republi- can, charming despite her white hair, and capable of educated
conversation in two languages. In June, 1813, Harriet had given birth to
a pretty daugh- ter, whom Shelley named Ianthe; that summer he moved
with them, and sister Eliza, to Bracknell, a pleasant place thirty miles
from London. Shortly thereafter Mrs. Boynton took a house there, and
gathered about her a circle of French emigres and English radicals whose
views on government and diet pleased Shelley. More and more frequently
he left Harriet and Ianthe with Eliza, and went off to enjoy the company
of Mrs. Boynton, her</p>
<p>friends, and her married daughter.</p>
<p>Several shadows had fallen across his relations with his wife. He
seems to have felt a certain retardation in her intellectual growth: she
was increas- ingly absorbed in her child, and careless about politics,
and yet she had de- veloped a liking for gay comforts and fine clothes;
partly for her sake he</p>
<p>474</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>had bought an expensive carriage. At this critical juncture in his
affairs (May 2 6, 1813) he received notice from his father that unless
he retracted his atheism and apologized to the master of his college at
Oxford, he would disinherit him and end all financial aid. In
expectation of a substantial be- quest on his coming of age (August 4,
1813), Shelley had contracted debts that mortgaged his future. Harriet
and Eliza panicked, and obviously won- dered whether Paris was not worth
a Mass. Shelley refused to recant, and continued to frequent the soirees
of Mrs. Boynton. Godwin sent word that he was facing arrest by his
creditors, and implied that he would welcome aid. In June, 1814, Harriet
moved with her child to Bath, apparently in the expectation that her
husband would soon join her there. Shelley went to London, took a room
in Fleet Street, tried to raise money for Godwin, and almost daily dined
at the philosopher’s home in Skinner Street. There he met</p>
<p>She was the child in whose birth, seventeen years back, the gifted
but un- fortunate vindicator of the rights of woman had lost her life.
Mary’s fresh youth, her alert mind, her pale and thoughtful face, her
unconcealed admi- ration for Shelley, were too much for the poet, who
was still a lad of twenty-one. Again pity mingled with desire. He had
often heard of Mary Wollstonecraft and her remarkable book; here was her
daughter who, un- happy under a stern stepmother, went often to sit
alone beside her mother’s grave. Here — Shelley felt — with her double
heritage of sensitivity and intel- lect, was a finer mind and spirit
than Harriet. Within a week he was in the throes of a passion such as he
seems never to have experienced before. On July 6 he asked Godwin for
the hand of his daughter. The astonished phi- losopher denounced his
acolyte as “licentious,” forbade him the house, and put Mary under the
custody of her stepmother. 72</p>
<p>Soon afterward Thomas Love Peacock found the poet almost delirious in
his Fleet Street room. “Nothing that I have ever read, in tale or
history, could present a more striking image of a sudden, violent,
irresistible… pas- sion, than that under which I found him labouring,
when, at his request, I went up from the country to call on him…. His
eyes were bloodshot, his hair and dress disordered. He caught up a
bottle of laudanum, and said, ‘I never part from this.’” 73</p>
<p>Despite all obstacles, Shelley arranged to meet Mary at her mother’s
grave. He reduced her resistance by telling her that Harriet had been
un- faithful to him with a Mr. Ryan. 74 He continued for some time to
deny the legitimacy of the child that Harriet was now carrying (later he
claimed it was his own). She denied his charge, and Shelley’s friends
Peacock, Hogg, Trelawny, and his publisher Hookham supported her; Godwin
later re- jected it. 75</p>
<p>Shelley wrote to Harriet (still at Bath) and asked her to come to
London. She came (July 14, 1814), and was received into her father’s
house. The poet visited her there, and found her alarmingly ill. He
begged her to give him a separation; she refused. On returning to his
room he wrote to her a hectic letter assuming some kind of
agreement:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>My Dearest Friend:</p>
<p>Exhausted as I am with our interview, and secure of seeing you
tomorrow, at 12, 1 cannot refrain from writing to you.</p>
<p>I am made calm and happier by your assurances….</p>
<p>For this, dearest Harriet, from my inmost soul I thank you. This is
perhaps the greatest among the many blessings which I have received, and
still am destined to receive, at your hands. I loathed the very light of
day, and looked upon my own being with deep and unutterable abhorrence.
I lived in the hope of consolation and happiness from you and have not
been deceived.</p>
<p>I repeat (believe me for I am sincere) that my attachment to you is
unim- paired: I conceive that it has acquired even a deeper and more
lasting charac- ter, that it is now less exposed than ever to the
fluctuations of phantasy or caprice. Our connection was not one of
passion and impulse. Friendship was its basis, and on this basis it has
been enlarged and strengthened. It is no reproach to me that you have
never filled my heart with an all-sufficing passion….</p>
<p>Shall I not be more than a friend? Oh, far more Brother, Father of
your child, so dear as it is to us both….</p>
<p>If you want to draw on the Bankers before I see you, Hookham will
give you the cheques.</p>
<p>Adieu. Bring my sweet babe. I must ever love her for your sake.</p>
<p>Ever most affectionately yours,</p>
<p>P. B. Shelley. 70</p>
<p>Harriet gave, her own account in a letter of November 20, 1814, to
Cath- erine Nugent:</p>
<p>… Mary was determined to seduce him…. She heated his imagination by
talking of her mother, and going to her grave with him every day, till
at last she told him she was dying in love for him…. Why [Mary asked]
could we not all live together? I as his sister, she as his wife? He had
the folly to believe this possible, and sent for me, then residing at
Bath. You may suppose how I felt at the disclosure. I was laid up for a
fortnight after. I could do nothing for myself. He begged me to live….
Here I am, my dear friend, waiting to bring another infant into this
woeful world. Next month I shall be confined. He will not be near
me.</p>
<p>H. Shelley. 77</p>
<p>Godwin gave some details in a letter of August 27, 1814, to John
Taylor:</p>
<p>I had the utmost confidence in him [Shelley] ; I knew him susceptible
of the noblest sentiments; he was a married man, who had lived happily
with his wife for three years…. On Sunday, June 26th, he accompanied
Mary, and her sister Jane Clairmont, to the tomb of Mary’s mother….
There, it seems, the j</p>
<p>impious idea occurred to him of seducing her, playing the traitor to
me, and deserting his wife…. On Wednesday, the 6th of July,… he had the
mad- ness to disclose his plans to me and to ask my consent. I
expostulated with him,</p>
<p>… and with so much effect that for the moment he promised to give up
his licentious love…. They both deceived me. In the night of the 27th
Mary and her sister Jane escaped from my home; and the next morning I
found a letter informing me what they had done. 78</p>
<p>Jane Clairmont was only stepsister to Mary, being the daughter of the
second Mrs. Godwin by a former husband. Originally named Clara Mary
Jane, she preferred to be called Clara, and became Clare or Claire. Born
April 27, 1798, she was now sixteen years old, and was quite
consciously</p>
<p>47 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>nubile. Talented and generous, sensitive and proud, she fretted under
the authority of a worried and irritable mother, and a stepfather too
burdened and bankrupt to spare her any love. She appealed to Mary and
Shelley to take her with them. They did, and on July 28, 1814, the three
fled from London to Dover, and thence to France.</p>
<p>On August 20 the pilgrims reached Lucerne. There Shelley found no
message for him, and no money from London. He had in his purse only
twenty-eight pounds. Sadly he told his comrades that he must return to
England and settle his finances. By boat and carriage they hurried
north, and on September 13, 1814, they were again in London. He spent
the next twenty months hiding from his creditors, and raising more loans
to feed himself, Mary, Claire, and Godwin, who still refused to see him
but wel- comed cash remittances. Meanwhile Harriet gave birth to her
second child, Charles; Mary gave birth to her first, William; and Claire
leaped into By- ron’s bed. Finally the poet’s grandfather died, leaving
to Shelley’s father, now Sir Timothy Shelley, property valued at eighty
thousand pounds. Shel- ley was now heir apparent, but not so recognized
by his father. He offered to resign his rights in exchange for a life
annuity of a thousand pounds; it was agreed; and Shelley pledged two
hundred a year to Harriet. On May 4, 1816, he, Mary, William, and Claire
left again for Dover and France. Nine days before th em Byron had
“kicked the dust of England from his feet.”</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>SWISS HOLIDAY: BYRON AND SHELLEY, 1 8 16</li>
</ol>
<p>Both poets, independently, had chosen Switzerland as their haven, and
Geneva as their center of operations. Shelley’s party arrived on May 15,
and took lodgings in suburban Secheron. Byron and his retinue boarded at
Ostend a sumptuous coach which he had ordered built, at a cost of five
hun- dred pounds, on the model of one used by Napoleon and captured at
Genappe as part of the trophies of Waterloo; it had a bed, a library,
and all facilities for dining. Byron made a special tour of the ground
and the re- mains of the battle; and probably at Brussels that evening
composed the stanzas 21 to 28 that were to be especially memorable in
Canto 111 of Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Late on May 25 he checked in at the Hotel d’Angleterre, a mile north
of Geneva center. The entry register required him to give his age; he
wrote “100.” Claire Clairmont, who had been eagerly checking arrivals,
discovered this, and sent him a note commiserating on his age and
suggesting a rendez- vous. On May 27 he came across Shelley, Mary, and
Claire at a boat land- ing; this was the first meeting of the poets.
Byron had read Queen Mab, had praised its poetry, but had been politely
silent about its politics; it was too much to expect a youth of
twenty-four to understand the virtues of aristoc- racy — though they
might have agreed on the convenience of inheritance. Shelley to the end
considered Byron his superior in poetry.</p>
<p>On July 4 he leased a home at Montallegre, two miles from Geneva,
on</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) THE REBEL POETS 477</p>
<p>he southern shore of Lake Geneva. On July 7 Byron rented the Villa
Diodati, ten minutes’ walk from Shelley. They united in leasing a small
sailboat, and the two families often joined in sailing on the lake, or
in an evening of discussion at the Villa Diodati. There, on June 14,
Byron sug- gested that each write a ghost story. They tried; all
confessed failure except Mary, who, aged nineteen, produced one of the
most famous novels of the nineteenth century — Frankenstein, or The
Modern Prometheus ; it was pub- lished in 1818, with a preface by
Shelley. Among many other remarkable features it posed two problems
still of basic interest: Can science create life? And can it keep its
powers from producing evil as well as good?</p>
<p>Byron also suggested that he and Shelley undertake to circumnavigate
the lake in their modest boat, stopping at historic spots, especially
those made famous by Rousseau’s Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heloise. Shelley
agreed, though he still had not learned to swim. They set out, with two
boatmen, on June 22, and took two days to reach Meillerie (in Savoy).
There they lin- gered on the spot where, in the novel, Saint-Preux,
banished from Julie, had supposedly written her name upon the rocks.
Resuming their voyage, the poets ran into a sudden storm; the waves
repeatedly climbed over the prow into the boat, threatening to capsize
it. Byron later recalled the scene: “I stripped off my coat, made him
strip off his and take hold of an oar, telling him that I thought… I
could save him if he would not struggle when I took hold of him…. He
answered with the greatest coolness that he had no notion of being
saved, that I would have enough to do to save myself, and begged not to
trouble me.” 79</p>
<p>The storm subsided, the poets landed and rested, and on the next
morning they visited Chillon aiid the castle where Frangois de Bonnevard
had been imprisoned (1530-36) by the Duke of Lausanne. At Clarens —
Shelley hold- ing Rousseau’s novel in his hands as a guide— the poets
walked over the ground made memorable as a sanctuary of French
Romanticism. On June 27 they docked at Ouchy, port of Lausanne; that
night Byron wrote The Pris- oner of Chillon and sketched the stanzas on
Rousseau in Childe Harold. On June 28 the poets visited the Lausanne
home in which Gibbon had written The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire. On July 1 the wanderers were back at Montallegre and Diodati.
During the next two weeks Byron wrote the third canto of Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage, and Claire Clairmont copied it for him, knowing now one of
the few happy moments in her life.</p>
<p>It was her fate to bring misfortune with her. Her open devotion to
By- ron raised Swiss gossip to a point where it hurt: the two poets, it
charged, were living in promiscuous relations with two sisters. Some
imaginative souls called Byron and Shelley incarnate devils; and one
English lady trav- eling in Switzerland fainted when Byron appeared at
Mme. de Stael’s Cop -</p>
<p>[ )et salon. 80 Perhaps the gossip shared in Byron’s determination to
end his re - ations with Claire. He asked Shelley not to let her come to
the Villa Diodati anymore. Claire, no w three months pregnant with
Byron’s child, pleaded to be allowed one more visit, but was
dissuaded.</p>
<p>On July 24 Shelley took Claire and Mary on a trip to Chamonix in
Savoy.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>They failed that day — succeeded on the next — in their attempt to
reach the Mer-de-Glace. Returning to Switzerland, they stopped at a
Chartreuse mon- astery in Montenvers. Under his signature in the guest
book — irritated by the pious entries before his own — he wrote, in
Greek: “ Eimi philanthropos demokratikos iatheos te —” (I am a lover of
mankind, a democrat, and an atheist). 81 When Byron, shortly thereafter,
stopped at the same place, he blotted out the “ atheos fearing that it
would be used against Shelley in England. It was. 82</p>
<p>On August 29 Shelley, Mary, and Claire left for England. Byron
gave</p>
<p>Shelley the manuscript of The Prisoner of Chillon and Cantos in and
iv of Childe Harold for delivery to the publisher John Murray. Shelley
himself, busy with Mary and Claire, brought only the “Hymn to
Intellectual</p>
<p>Beauty,” and the ode “Mount Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Cha -
mouni [Chamonix].” This ode is almost as confused as the rivulets of ice
that curl down the mountain slopes to the Mer-de-Glace. Shelley found
his impressions so many and so diverse that he was unable to give them
any clear expression; and while for a time he thought of the towering
mass as voicing Wordsworth’s Nature God, he fell back upon the feeling
of a cold immensity disdainfully silent before all human judgments.</p>
<p>The “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” also shows some influence of Words
- worth, but Shelley’s “intimations of immortality” soon fade. He
wonders why there is darkness as well as light, evil as well as good. He
dreams that man might yet be saved by a deepening and broadening of the
aesthetic sense, and the pursuit of the beautiful in thought and deed as
well as in flesh and form:</p>
<p>I vowed that I would dedicate my powers</p>
<p>To thee and thine — have I not kept the vow?…</p>
<p>… never joy illumed my brow</p>
<p>Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free</p>
<p>This world from its dark slavery,</p>
<p>That thou — O awful Loveliness,</p>
<p>Wouldst give whate’er these words cannot express. 83</p>
<p>In the end the attempts of Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley to find a
benevolent friend in nature failed before its calm neutrality.
Wordsworth surrendered to the Church of England; Byron and Shelley
surrendered to despair.</p>

<p>In September, 1 8 1 6, Hobhouse came down from England, and joined
By- ron in an extensive tour of the Swiss Alps. In October they crossed
them into Italy. They were well received at Milan; the educated Italians
honored Byron as England’s grea test living poet, and appreciated his
evident dis- taste for Austrian rule in Lombardy. He took a box at La
Scala. Stendhal saw</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>him there, and described him ecstatically: “I was struck by his
eyes…. I have never in my life seen anything more beautiful or more
expressive. Even today, if I come to think of the expression which a
great painter should give to a genius, this sublime head at once appears
before me…. I shall never forget the divine expression of his face; it
was the serene air of power and genius.” 84</p>
<p>Poet and friend reached Venice on November 1 6, 1816. Hob house left
him for hurried sightseeing, and soon went on to Rome; Byron took lodg-
ings in a side street off the Piazza San Marco, and made a mistress of
his land- lord’s wife, Marianna Segati. Even so he found time to
complete Manfred and (September, 1 8 1 8) to begin Don Juan, in which he
passed from gloomy, romantic, self-indulgent brooding to rollicking,
humorous, realistic satire.</p>
<p>Manfred, of course, is Byron again, now disguised as a melancholy
misan- thrope in a Gothic castle. Feeling “a strong curse upon my soul,”
and brood - ing over his sins, he summons the witches from their Alpine
lairs, and asks from them one gift — forgetfulness. They answer that
forgetfulness comes only with death. He climbs the Jungfrau, and sees in
a lightning-blasted pine tree a symbol of himself — “a blighted trunk
upon a cursed rock, which but supplies a feeling to decay.” He seeks
death by trying to jump from a cliff; a hunter stops him, leads him to a
mountain cottage, offers him a warming wine, and asks the reason for his
despair. Manfred, taking the wine for blood, replies in words that might
be taken as a confession of incest:</p>
<p>I say ’tis blood! the pure warm stream</p>
<p>Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours</p>
<p>When we were in our youth, and had our heart,</p>
<p>And loved each other as we should not love;</p>
<p>And that was shed; but still rises up,</p>
<p>Coloring the clouds that shut me out from heaven.</p>
<p>He envies the hunter’s free and healthy life</p>
<p>By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes</p>
<p>Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,</p>
<p>With cross and garland over its green turf.</p>
<p>And thy grandchildren’s lov e for epitaph;</p>
<p>This do I see — and then I look within —</p>
<p>It matters not — my soul was scorched already.</p>
<p>He gives the hunter gold, and departs. Using his unsanctioned
science, he summons Astarte, in whom he sees the figure of his forbidden
love. His ap- peal to her to forgive him — “Astarte, my beloved, speak
to me!”— is one of the high flights of Byronic passion and sentiment.
Like the major criminals in Gulliver’s land of the Luggnaggians, he has
been condemned to immor - tality, and thinks it the greatest possible
penalty; he begs her, out of her mystic power, to grant him the gift of
death. She accommodates him: “Man - fred, tomorrow ends thy earthly
fife.” An attendant witch applauds his courage: “He mastereth himself,
and makes his torture tributary to his will. Had he been one of us he
would have made an awful spirit.” Milton’s Satan</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>

<p>may have left here one of many echoes in Byron’s works. — To the
abbot who, on the following evening, seeks to win him back to Christ,
Manfred answers that it is too late, and adds:</p>

<p>Of mortals on the earth, who do become</p>

<p>And when Manfred leaves for his last rendezvous, the abbot
mourns:</p>
<p>This should have been a noble creature; he</p>
<p>Hath all the energy which would have made</p>
<p>A goodly frame of glorious elements.</p>
<p>Had they been wisely mingled.</p>
<p>As if challenging the world to think that its darkest suspicions of
him were now confessed, Byron sent Manfred to England, and Murray pub-
lished it on June 16, 1817. A week later a review in a London paper
called for an end to all sympathy for Byron, w ho “has coloured Manfred
into his own personal features…. Manfred has exiled himself from
society, and what is to be the ground of our compassion for the exile?
Simply the com- mission of one of the most revolting crimes. He has
committed incest!” 85</p>
<p>On April 17, 1817, Byron left Venice to spend a month with Hobhouse
in Rome. His foot deterred him from touring the museums, but he saw the
massive relics of classical Rome, and visited Pompeii; “I stand a ruin
amidst ruins,” said Childe Harold. 86 By May 28 he was back in
Venice.</p>
<p>In December he succeeded, after many trials, in selling Newstead
Abbey and its lands for ,£94,500; he instructed his London banker,
Douglas Kin- naird, to pay all the poet’s debts, and send him £ 3,300
annually from th e earnings of the residue; in addition to this he now
agreed to receive pay- ment for his poems. Flush, he bought the
sumptuous Palazzo Mocenigo on the Grand Canal. He peopled it with
fourteen servants, two monkeys, two mastiffs, and a new mistress —
Margarita Cogni, proud wife of a local banker. He was not monogynous; he
boasted of having had two hundred women, seriatim, in Venice. 87 On
January 20, 1817, he informed Kinnaird that “in the evenings I go out
sometimes, and indulge in coition always”; and on May 9, 1818, he wrote
to the banker, “I have a world of harlotry.” 88 By midsummer he had
fallen far from the divinity described by Stendhal two years before; he
was fat, his hair was turning gray, and he looked older than his thirty
years. Shelley was shocked to find him so when they met again.</p>
<p>X. SHELLEY PATER FAM1LIAS: 1 8 1 6-1 8</p>
<p>On September 8, 1816, Shelley, Mary, their child William, his Swiss
nurse Elise Foggi, and Claire Clairmont reached England. All but Shelley
went to Bath; he hurried to London, expecting to find there five hundred
pounds from his father. None came, and he had to default on his promise
to give</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) THE REBEL POETS 481</p>
<p>hree hundred pounds to his desperate father-in-love. Godwin fumed;
Shel- ley fled to his lawless mate in Bath.</p>
<p>There, on September 26 and October 3, Mary received tender letters
from her half sister Fanny Godwin. Bom in France in 1794, Fanny was the
“nat - ural” daug hter of Captain Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft. She had
been adopted by Godwin on his marriage to her mother. Despite his
kindness she had been unhappy under the unwilling care of his second
wife, Mrs. Clair- mont. Her letters reveal a gentle soul, bearing
misfortune bravely, blaming no one, and timidly eager to please. Mary
had been sisterly to her, but after Mary and Claire went off with
Shelley Fanny had no protection against her stepmother. When the elopers
returned to England their precarious finances did not encourage them to
add Fanny to their fold. On October 12 Shelley brought to Mary and
Claire the news that Fanny had gone to Swansea, secluded herself in a
hotel room, and killed herself with opium.</p>
<p>The Furies had little mercy on Shelley. On returning to England he
had inquired about his wife, to whom he was still legally bound. He
learned that she was living with her father, and was regularly receiving
four hun- dred pounds a year. In November he sought to visit her, but
was told that she had disappeared. On December 12, 1816, the Times
reported that her body had been recovered, two days before, from the
Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Anxious to get custody of his offspring by Harriet — daughter Ianthe
and son Charles — Shelley hurried to legalize with marriage his union
with Mary (December 30, 1816). Through three months his claim for the
children dragged on in the Court of Chancery. Mary assured him that she
would be “very happy to receive those darling treasures”— the children
of Harriet- under her care. But Harriet’s father and sister contested
Shelley’s claim on</p>
<p>While her husband was litigating in London, Mary watched over Claire
Clairmont, who, still only nineteen, gave birth (January 12, 1817) to a
daughter ultimately named Allegra. Claire’s letters to Byron, since
leaving Switzerland, had not been answered, though Shelley’s were; and
the thought that Byron would never acknowledge the child drove the
mother to despair. Shelley appealed to Byron for instructions, taking
care to stress Allegra’s beauty. Byron agreed to take and care for the
child if she were brought to him. Mary complicated matters (September,
1817) by giving birth to her second child, who was baptized Clara
Everina. Mother and child ailed, and soon all the adults agreed that
what the family needed was the warmth and sky and fruits of Italy. On
March 1 1, 1818, they crossed to France, and be- gan the long ride, by
mal-de-mer coaches, to Milan.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Thence Shelley sent Byron an invitation to come and see Allegra.
Fearing that this might lead to a renewed liaison with Claire, Byron
refused; instead, he suggested, her nurse should take the child to
Venice, and if the adoption plan proved satisfactory, the mother should
be free to visit Allegra now and then. Claire reluctantly consented.
Byron found the little girl so lovely and lovable that he took her into
his palace; but Allegra was so frightened by his animals and concubines
that Byron soon paid Richard Hoppner, British consul, and his wife, to
take the child into their home.</p>
<p>Hearing of this, Shelley and Claire (leaving Mary and her children
at</p>
<p>Lucca) went to Venice, and found Allegra reasonably well treated.
Byron received Shelley cordially, took him on a gondola ride to the
Lido, and in- vited him and his family, with Claire and Allegra, to stay
as long as they liked in Byron’s villa, I Cappuccini, at Este. Mary came
from Lucca with her chil - dren, but Clara Everina sickened on the way,
and died in Venice (Septem- ber 24, 1818). On October 29, after a
month’s stay in I Cappuccini, they bade goodbye to Allegra, and headed
south for Rome.</p>

<li>SHELLEY: ZENITH, 1819-21</li>
</ol>
<p>Between his arrival in Rome (1819) and his reunion with Byron in Pisa
(1821) the great events in Shelley’s life were his poems. There had been
flashes of high excellence before, as here and there in Queen Mab, and
latterly as in “Ozymandias” ( 1 8 1 7)— a sonnet of compact thought and
startling force. The “Lines Written in the Euganean Hills” (1818) lack
such concentration of thought and chiseled form; and the “Lines Written
in Dejection near Nap les” (1818) are too self -pitying to invite
condolence; a man should not wear his grievances on his sleeve. But now,
in three years, came Prometheus Unbound, “Ode to the West Wind,” “To a
Skylark,” “The Cloud,” Epi - psychidion, and Adonais. We pass by The
Cenci (1819), in which Shelley, with some success, tried to rival John
Webster and other Elizabethan- Jacobean dramatists in a dark and bloody
story of incest and murder.</p>
<p>Prometheus Unbound, according to the author’s preface, was written
atop the Baths of Caracalla in Rome in 1820. He had challenged the
Elizabethans with The Cenci ; now he risked the farthest grasp of his
ambition by chal- lenging the Greeks. In Prometheus Bound Aeschylus had
shown the “Fore - knower” as a rebellious Titan ch ained to a rock in
the Caucasus for revealing to mankind too much of the tree of knowledge.
In the lost remainder of the trilogy, according to tradition, Zeus had
relented and had freed Prometheus from the rock, and from the eagle
which, by divine command, had con- tinually pecked at the hero’s liver,
like doubt at a rebel’s certainties. Shelley’s “lyrical drama” (as he
called it) pictures Zeus as a crusty old Bourbon cruelly responsible for
the misfortunes of mankind and the misbehavior of the earth; Prometheus
blasts him with all the ardor of an Oxford under- graduate summoning
bishops to the obsequies of God. Then the Titan re-</p>
<p>CHAP, xxn)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>grets the intensity of his curse: “I wish no living thing to suffer
pain.” 89 He returns to his chosen task — to bring wisdom and love to
all mankind. The Spirit of the Earth, rejoicing, hails him: “Thou art
more than God, being wise and kind.” 90</p>
<p>Through Act I the speeches are bearable, and the lyrics of the
attendant spirits rumble with elemental power, sparkle with ambrosial
metaphors, and ride on melodious rhymes. But speeches, theological or
atheological, are not the lightning of poetry; odes become odious and
lyrics lose their lure when they fall upon the reader with confusing
profusion; beauty unending be- comes a bore. Too much of Shelley’s
poetry is emotion remembered ’with - out tranquillity. As we proceed we
sense something of weakness in these verses, too many sentiments for too
few deeds; too many moods and lines of hearts and flowers (“I am as a
drop of dew that dies,” says the Spirit of the Earth 91 ). It is a style
that can adorn a lyric but slows a drama — which, by its name, shou ld
move with action; a “lyrical drama” is a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>By contrast the “Ode to the West Wind” (1819) stirs us throughout,
for its powerful inspiration is compressed into seventy lines. Here
Shelley’s richness of rhymes has no time to cloy; the emotion is not
spread thin, but is centered on one idea — that the winter of our
discontent may hopefully be followed by some spring of growth. This
time-honored metaphor repeatedly occurs in Shelley; it sustained him
when his world of hopes and dreams seemed to fall in ruins before the
onset of experience. He prayed that his ideas, like fallen leaves before
the wind, might be preserved and spread through the “airy incantation of
his verse.” They were.</p>
<p>That ode, which touches the peaks of poetry, was “conceived and
chiefly written” (Shelley tells us) “in a wood that skirts the Arno near
Florence, and on a day when that tempestuous wind… was collecting the
vapours which pour down the autumnal rain s.” 92 Why had he left Rome?
Partly be - cause he had either to seclude himself or to bear the
nearness of British tour- ists who thought of him not as a great poet
but as an adulterous atheist. More keenly he and Mary felt the death of
their child William (June 7,</p>
<p>1819), after only four years of life. Neither parent ever fully
recovered from the loss of both their children within nine months. Gray
hairs appeared among Shelley’s brown, though he was only twenty
-seven.</p>
<p>After burying William in the English cemetery at Rome, the family</p>
<p>moved north to Livorno, Anglice Leghorn. Wandering in a garden there,
Shelley felt hurt, as any poet might, at the frightened flight of birds
on his approach. One especially fascinated him by its singing as it
soared. Going back to his room, he composed the first form of “To a
Skylark,” with its haunting, brooding hexameters. Those airy stanzas
offend not with their rhymes, for every line is warm with feeling and
solid with thought.</p>
<p>On October 2, 1819, the Shelleys moved to Florence, where Mary gave
birth to her third child, soon named Percy. In Florence Claire Clairmont
found employment as a governess, and at last freed Shelley from her
care.</p>
<p>484 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XOn October 29, 1820, he moved his family to the Hotel Tre Palazzi in
Pisa, where he had perhaps the strangest adventure of all.</p>
<p>Despite his repeated illnesses he had not lost his sensitivity to
sexual gravi- tation; and when he found a woman not only beautiful but
unfortunate the double attraction overwhelmed him. Emilia Viviani was a
girl of high family, who had been, against her will, placed in a convent
near Pisa to safeguard her virginity till a financially proper husband
could be found for her. Shel- ley, Mary, and sometimes Claire went to
see her, and all were charmed by her classic features, her modest
manners, and her confiding simplicity. The poet idealized her, made her
the object of his waking dreams, and wrote some of them out in Epipsy
chidion (“To a soul unique”? ), which was pub- lished under a pseudonym
in 1821. Some surprising lines:</p>
<p>I never thought before my death to see</p>
<p>Youth’s vision thus made perfect. Emily,</p>
<p>I love thee; though the world by no thin name</p>
<p>Will hide that love from its unvalued shame.</p>
<p>Would we two had been twins of the same mother!</p>
<p>Or, that the name my heart lent to another</p>
<p>Could be a sister’s bond for her and thee,</p>
<p>Blending two beams of one eternity!</p>
<p>Yet were one lawful and the other true,</p>
<p>These names, though dear, could paint not, as is due,</p>
<p>How beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me!</p>
<p>I am not thine: I am a part of thee.</p>
<p>And so from ecstasy to ecstasy:</p>
<p>Spouse, Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate</p>
<p>Whose course has been so starless! O too late</p>
<p>Beloved! O too soon adored, by me!</p>
<p>For in the fields of immortality</p>
<p>My spirit should at first have worshipped thine,</p>
<p>A divine presence in a place divine.</p>
<p>Clearly the youth of twenty-eight was in a condition favoring
idealiza- tion; our laws and morals cannot quite regulate our glands;
and if one is a genius or a poet, he must find outlet and relief in act
or art. In this case the ailment was cured or redeemed by a poem that
oscillates between absurdity and excellence:</p>
<p>The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me….</p>
<p>A ship is floating in the harbour now,</p>
<p>A wind is hovering o’er the mountain’s brow</p>
<p>o take them to an island in the blue Aegean;</p>
<p>It is an isle ’twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,</p>
<p>Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity…</p>
<p>This isle and house are mine, and I have vowed</p>
<p>Thee to be lady of the solitude.</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>There she shall be his love, and he be hers:</p>
<p>Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,</p>
<p>And our veins beat together; and our lips</p>
<p>With other eloquence than words, eclipse</p>
<p>The soul that burns between them, and the wells</p>
<p>Which boil under our being’s inmost cells,</p>
<p>The fountains of our deepest life, shall be</p>
<p>Confused in Passion’s golden purity…</p>
<p>I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire ! 98</p>
<p>Can this be “Shelley plain”? Poor Mary, left to her baby Percy and
her own dreams, did not see these effusions for some time. Meanwhile the
vision faded; Emilia marrie d, and (according to Mary) led her husband
“a devil of a life”; 94 Shelley repented his melodious sin, and Mary
nursed his desolation with motherly understanding.</p>
<p>He was roused to better poetry when he heard that Keats had died
(Feb- ruary 23, 1821). He may not have cared much for Endymion, but the
“savage criticism” with which the Quarterly Review had greeted Keats’s
major effort so angered him that he called upon their common Muse to in-
spire in him a fitting threnody. On June 1 1 he wrote to his London pub-
lisher: “ ‘Adonais’ is finished, and you will soon receive it. It is
little adapted</p>
<p>In the final stanzas Shelley welcomed his own death as a blessed
reunion with the undying dead:</p>
<p>The One remains, the many change and pass;</p>
<p>Heaven’s light forever shines, Earth’s shadows fly;</p>
<p>Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</p>
<p>Stains the white radiance of Eternity,</p>
<p>Until Death tramples it to fragments. — Die,</p>
<p>If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!…</p>
<p>Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?</p>
<p>Thy hopes are gone before; from all things here</p>
<p>They have departed; thou shouldst now depart!…</p>
<p>’Tis Adonais calls! Oh! hasten thither,</p>
<p>No more let Life divide what Death can join together….</p>
<p>I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;</p>

<li>LOVE AND REVOLUTION: BYRON, l8l8-2I</li>
</ol>
<p>Shelley retained varied memories of Byron in their last meeting — his
fine manners, candid conversation, generous impulses — and his apparent
content with a degrading promiscuity of companions and courtesans. “The
Italian women with whom he associates are perhaps the most contemptible
of all who exist under the moon…. Byron is familiar with the lowest sort
of these women, the people his gondoliers pick up in the streets. He
allows fathers and mothers to bargain with him for their daughters…. But
that he is a great poet I think his address to the ocean proves.” 99
Byron was well aware of his abandonment of English morals and tastes;
the English code had outlawed him, and he would reject it in return. Yet
he told a friend in 1819, “I was disgusted and tired with the life I led
in Venice, and was glad to turn my back on it.” 100 He succeeded, with
the help, patience, and devotion of Teresa Guiccioli.</p>
<p>They first met on her visit from Ravenna to Venice in April, 1819.
She was nineteen, petite, pretty, vain, convent-educated, warmhearted,
passion- ate. Her husband, Count Alessandro Guiccioli, fifty-eight, had
had two pre- vious marriages, and was often immersed in business. It was
for precisely such a. situation that the current moral code of the
upper-class Italians al- lowed a woman to have a cavaliere servente — a
gentleman servitor who would be always within call to admire, amuse, or
escort her, and be re- warded with a kiss of her hand — or something
more if they were discreet and the husband was preoccupied or tired.
There was moderate danger of a duel, but sometimes the husband would
appreciate the aid, and would absent himself a while. So the Contessa
felt free to be drawn to the English- man’s handsome face, intriguing
conversation, and c harming limp. Or in her later words:</p>
<p>His noble and exquisitely beautiful countenance, the tone of his
voice, his manners, the thousand enchantments that surrounded him,
rendered him so different, and so superior a being to any whom I had
hitherto seen, that it was impossible that he should not have left the
most profound impression upon me. From that evening, during the whole of
my subsequent stay in Venice, we met every day. 101</p>
<p>Those days of reckless happiness ended when the Count took Teresa
back to Ravenna. Byron sent her some promissory notes, as on April 22,
1819: “I assure you that you shall be my last passion. Before I knew
you, I felt an interest in many women, but never in one only. Now I love
you; there is no other woman in the worl d for me.” So far as we know,
he kept that pledge.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>On June 1, in his “heavy Napoleonic carriage,” he left Venice for</p>
<p>Ravenna as a tourist seeking Dante’s remains. Teresa welcomed him;
the Count was complaisan t; Byron wrote to a friend: “They make love a
good deal here, and assassinate a little.” 102 He was allowed to take
Teresa to La Mira (seven miles south of Venice), where he had a villa;
there the love affair advanced unhindered even by Teresa’s hemorrh oids.
103 Allegra joined them there and made the party respectable. Tom Moore
dropped in, and now received from Byron the manuscript of “My Life and
Adventures,” which was to cause so much commotion after the author’s
death.</p>
<p>From La Mira Byron took Teresa to Venice, where she lived with him in
his Palazzo Mocenigo. There her father reclaimed her, and — forbidding
Byron to follow — took her back to Ravenna. On arrival Teresa fell so
convincingly ill that the Count hurriedly sent for her lover. Byron came
(December 24, 1819), and, after some wandering, settled down as a paying
tenant on the third floor of the Count’s palace. He brought with him
into his new quarters two cats, six dogs, a badger, a falcon, a tame
crow, a monkey, and a fox. Amid this life of varied dedications he wrote
more of Don Juan, some rhetorical and unstageable plays on Venetian
doges, a more presentable drama about Sardanapalus, and, in July, 1821,
Cain: A Mystery, which com- pleted the abomination of his name in
England.</p>
<p>The opening scene shows Adam and Eve, Cain and his sister-wife Adah,
Abel and his sister-wife Zillah, preparing to offer sacrifices and
prayers to Jehovah. Cain asks his parents some of the questions that had
puzzled Byron in his schooldays: Why did God invent death? If Eve ate of
the tree of knowledge, why had God planted that forbidden tree so
prominently in the Garden of Eden; and why should the desire for
knowledge be ac- counted a sin? Why, in punishment for Eve’s modest
collation, had the Omnipotent decreed labor as the lot and death as the
fate of all living things? What is death? (No one had yet seen it.) Cain
is left rebelliously brooding while the rest go to their tasks of the
day. Lucifer (Lightbearer) appears, takes over the stage as in Milton,
and calls himself proudly one of those</p>
<p>Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in</p>
<p>His everlasting face, and tell him that</p>
<p>His evil is not good.</p>
<p>Adah returns and pleads with Cain to rejoin his relatives in the
field; he has neglected his share of the day’s work; she has done it for
him, and now in - vites him to an hour of love and rest. Lucifer taunts
her by describing love as a lure to reproduction, and predicts the
centuries of toil, strife, suffering, and death awaiting the multitudes
that will trace their existence to her womb…. Cain and Abel prepare
their altars; Abel sacrifices the first of his flock; Cain offers fruit,
but, instead of a prayer, asks again why the Omnipotent has permitted
evil. Abel’s sacrificial lamb is consumed in a bright flame that ascends
to heaven; Cain’s altar is overthrown by an angry wind that scatters his
fruit in the dust. Furious, he tries to demolish Abel’s altar. Abel
resists; Cain strikes him; Abel dies. Adam reproaches Eve as the primal
source of sin; Eve curses Cain; Adah pleads for him: “Curse him not,</p>
<p>4 88</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>mother, for he is my brother / And my betrot hed.” Adam bids Cain
leave them and never return; Adah accompanies Cain into banishment.
Since Abel had died childless, all humanity (Byron concludes) was Cain’s
progeny, and bears his mark in secret instincts finding vent in
violence, murder, and war.</p>
<p>Cain seems at times an essay in defiance by a schoolboy atheist who
has not read Ecclesiastes; and yet at times the drama rises to an almost
Miltonic power. Walter Scott, to whom the Mystery was dedicated, praised
it; as Goethe, losing for a mome nt his Olympian perspective, said, “Its
beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world.” 104 In
England its publication was met with a furor of criticism and horror:
here, it seemed, was another Cain, but a worse murderer — killing the
faith that had sustained a thousand generations. Murray warned Byron
that he was rapidly losing readers for his works.</p>
<p>The portrait of Cain’s faithful Adah gave another proof of tender ele
- ments in Byron’s character; but his treatment of Allegra and her
mother showed a tougher strain. The once happy child, now four years
old, had been saddened by the distances that separated her from both her
parents; and she felt that the Hoppners were wearying of her. Byron sent
for her to come to Ravenna; and yet he could hardly ask her to live with
him and his menagerie in the palace of the man who was becoming audibly
uncom- fortable with his horns. After much thought he put her into a
convent at Bagnacavallo, twelve miles from Ravenna (March i, 1821).
There, he pre- sumed, she would have companionship, be out of his way,
and receive some education. That this would be Catholic did not disturb
him; on the con- trary he felt that it would be a tragedy for the girl
to grow up without a religion in an Italy where every woman was a pious
Catholic even in her amours. After all, if one must be a Christian,
better go all the way, take the Apostles’ Creed, the Mass, and the
saints, and be a Catholic. “It is my wish,” he wrote on April 3, 1821,
“that Allegra should be a Roman Catholic, which I look upon as the best
religion.” 105 When Allegra was ready for marriage he would settle upon
her a fortune of four thousand pounds, and she would have no difficulty
in finding a husband.</p>
<p>This was convenient for Byron, but when the news of it reached Claire
Clairmont she protested passionately, and begged that Shelley get the
child restored to her. Shelley undertook to go to Ravenna and see how
Allegra was faring. He arrived there on August 6, 1821, and was
cordially received by Byron. He wrote back to his wife: “Lord Byron is
very well, and was delighted to see me. He has… completely recovered his
health, and lives a life totally the reverse of that which he led in
Venice.” 106 Byron told him that political conditions would soon compel
him to move to Florence or Pisa; he would take Allegra with him, and she
would be close to her mother. Shelley was content with this, and turned
his attention to something more immediately affecting himself.</p>
<p>He was dismayed to learn that Allegra’s nurse Elise (whom he had dis
- missed from his service in 1821) had told the Hoppners that he had
had</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>secret sexual relations with Allegra’s mother; that Claire, in
Florence, had borne his child, which he had at once placed in a
foundling asylum; fur- thermore, that Shelley and Claire had treated
Mary shamefully, even to his beating her. The astonished poet wrote at
once to Mary (August 7), asking her to write to the Hoppners denouncing
these tales; Mary did, but sent her letter to Shelley for his approval;
he showed it to Byron, and apparently relied on him to give it to
Hoppner. Shelley was disappointed to find that Byron had known of the
rumors, and had apparently believed them. The famous friendship began to
cool, and cooled further when Byron moved from Ravenna to Pisa, leaving
Allegra in her convent.</p>
<p>That change was the result of mixing love and revolution. In July,
1820, Teresa’s father, Count Ruggero Gamba, had secured from the Papal
Curia a writ awarding her a separation from her husband, with regular
payments of alimony from him, on condition that she live with her
parents. She moved accordingly, and Byron, still living in the Guiccioli
palace, became a frequent visitor to the Gamba household. He was
delighted to find that Gamba and his son Pietro were leaders in the
Carbonari, a secret organiza- tion plotting to overthrow Austrian rule
in north Italy, papal rule in middle Italy, and Bourbon rule at Naples
over the “Kingdom of the Two Sicilies”— i.e., south Italy and Sicily.
Byron, in “The Prophecy of Dante” (1819),</p>
<p>had already appealed to the Italian people to rise and free
themselves from Hapsburg or Bourbon rule. By 1820 Austrian spies
suspected him of paying for weapons to be delivered to the Carbonari;
and a royalist poster set up in Ravenna called for his assassination.
107 On February 24, 1821, the Carbonari insurrection failed; its leaders
fled from those parts of Italy under Austrian, papal, or Bourbon rule.
Count Gamba and son went to Pisa; on Byron’s advice Teresa soon followed
them; and on November 1, 1821, Byron ar- rived there, and settled in the
Casa Lanfranchi on the Arno, where Shelley had already rented rooms for
him. Now would come the final test of their friendship.</p>
<p>XIll. CONTRASTS</p>
<p>The two poets had now reached the fullness of their development. The
elder had still some cantos of Don Juan to compose; these are so bitter
in their hostility to England that even a Gallic taste can find them
immoderate. The Vision of Judgment (October, 1821) is also mercilessly
satirical, but Southey’s priori Vision of Judgment (April, 1821) had
provoked r etalia- tion by calling Byron the leader of the “Satanic”
school in English poetry; Byron cut him up with gusto and skill. In
these final compositions he moved away from the romantic self-pitying
melancholy of Childe Harold toward a more classic pose of reason and
humor judging all — but moderation still escaped him. His letters —
especially those to Murray — show a maturer mood, for there his caustic
wit was tempered with critical self-scrutiny, as if he had discovered
that modesty opens a door to wisdom.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>He was modest about his poetry. “I by no means rank poetry or poets
high in the scale of intellect. This may look like affectation, but it
is my real opinion…. I prefer the talents of action — of war, or the
senate, or even or science — to all the speculations of those mere
dreamers.” 108 He praised Shelley as a man, but thought much of his
verse to be childish fantasy. He was anxious to be valued as a man
rather than as a poet. He was painfully conscious of his appearance. He
preferred riding to walking, for his right foot distracted attention
from his handsome face. Dietetically his life was an alternation between
eating to obesity and dieting to debility; so in 1806 his five feet
eight and a half inches weighed 194 pounds; by 1812 he was down to 137;
by 1818 he had swelled to 202. He was proud of his sexual achieve-
ments, and sent mathematical reports of them to his friends. He was a
man of emotion; often lost his temper or self-control. His intellect was
brilliant but unsteady; “the moment Byron reflects,” said Goethe, “he is
a child.” 109</p>
<p>In religion he began as a Calvinist; in Childe Harold he spoke of
the</p>
<p>Papacy with old-Protestant v igor as “the Babylonian whore.” 110 In
his twenties he read philosophy, liked Spinoza, preferred Hume, and
declared, “I deny nothing, but doubt everything.” 111 In 18 1 1 he wrote
to a proselytiz - ing friend, “I will have nothing to do with your
immortality”; ten years later he wrote, “Of the immortality of the soul
it appears to me that there</p>
<p>Having in adolescence lost his religious belief, and having found no
moral mooring in literature or philosophy, he had no fulcrum from which
to offer resistance to the sensations, emotions, or desires that
agitated him. His free and agile intellect found persuasive reasons for
yielding, or his temperament gave reason no time to display the wisdom
of social restraints. Apparently he curbed his homosexual inclinations,
and satisfied them with warm and faithful friendships; but he yielded to
the charms of his sister; and in Childe Harold he boldly told of his
love for</p>
<p>one soft breast</p>
<p>Which unto his was bound by stronger ties</p>
<p>Than the Church links withal. 115</p>
<p>Condemned by English society for exceeding its permitted indulgences,
or failing to cover them gracefully, he declared war upon Britis h
“hypoc - risy” and “cant.” He satirized the upper classes as “formed of
two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.” He condemned the exploitation
of labor by the factory owners, and sometimes he called for
revolution:</p>
<p>“God save the King!” and kings.</p>
<p>For if he don’t I doubt if men will longer.</p>
<p>I think I hear a little bird, who sings,</p>
<p>The people by and by will be the stronger,…</p>
<p>and the mob</p>

<p>At last all sick of imitating Job….</p>
<p>1 would fain say, “Fie on’t.”</p>
<p>If I had not perceived that revolution</p>
<p>Alone can save the earth from hell’s pollution. 116</p>
<p>However, on second thought, he felt no attraction to democracy. He
dis- trusted mobs, and feared that a revolution would bring a
dictatorship worse than that of king or parliament. He saw some virtue
in rule by an aristocracy of birth, and longed for an aristocracy
purged, reasonable, trained, and competent. He himself never forgot that
he was a lord; he soon checked any assumption of egalitarian
familiarity; he knew that in social relations dis- tance lends
enchantment to the view.</p>
<p>His view of Napoleon changed with events. Till Bonaparte crowned</p>
<p>himself emperor, and armed and surrounded himself with titles, Byron
saw him as an excellent compromise between kings and mobs. Even with
baubles, and those questionable invasions of Spain and Russia, Byron
prayed for Napoleon to win against the Continental monarchies. He
scolded the defeated Emperor for not killing himself instead of
abdicating; but when Napoleon returned from Elba the poet again prayed
for his victory against the Allies. Six years later, hearing of
Napoleon’s death, he mourned: “His overthrow was a blow on the head to
me. Since that period we have been the slaves of fools.” 117</p>
<p>He was a baffling mixture of faults and virtues. He could in a rage
be coarse and cruel; normally he was courteous,, considerate, and
generous. He gave recklessly to friends in need; to Robert Dallas he
transferred copy- rights worth a thousand pounds; another thousand
enabled Francis Hodgson to avoid bankruptcy. Teresa Guiccioli, who saw
him almost daily through four years, described him as a veritable angel
through nine hundred pages. 118 He, far more than Coleridge, was a
“damaged archangel,” carrying in his flesh the flaws of his heritage,
illustrating and redeeming them with an audacity of conduct, a profusion
of verse, and a force of rebel thought that overwhelmed o ld Goethe into
calling him “the greatest [literary] genius of our century.” 119</p>
<p>By comparison Shelley was the “ineffectual angel” of historic phrase.
Not quite ineffectual; who shall say that the leaves scattered by the
incantation of his verse did not deposit some of the seeds that grew
into religious tolera- tion, the liberation of woman, the victories of
science in technology and philosophy, the extension of the franchise,
and the reform of Parliament that made the nineteenth a “wonderful
century”?</p>
<p>And he was a quite human angel. He had a body, and yielded to its</p>
<p>demands at least for two elopements, not to speak of Emilia Viviani.
He was thin, troubled with ailments, and with a persistent pain in the
back. Of course he was exceptionally sensitive — even more than Byron —
to external and internal stimuli. Recall his letter to Claire Clairmont
(January 16,</p>
<p>1821): “You ask me where I find my pleasures. The wind, the light,
the air, the smell of a flower, affect me with violent emotions.”
120</p>
<p>49 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>Like all of us, he was especially fond of himself. He confessed to
Godwin (January 28, 1812): “My egotism seems inexhaustible.” 121 In
taking Mary Godwin, and asking his wife Harriet to subside into a
sister, he pleased his desires like any other mortal, and revealed more
of himself in explaining that Harriet accorded less than Mary with his
philosophy and ideals. He was modest about his poetry, r ating it below
Byron’s. In friendship he was faith - ful and considerate to the end.
Byron, in reporting Shelley’s death to Mur - ray, wrote: “You were all
brutally mistaken about Shelley, who was,</p>
<p>without exception, the best and least selfish man I ever knew. I
never knew one who was not a beast by comparison.” 122 Hogg reported the
poet as erratic, forgetting appointments and promises, and readily
slipping into a meditation oblivious of time and place. 123 He was
generally accounted im- practical, but he was not easily cozened in
money matters, and he did not surrender his hereditary rights without a
long struggle.</p>
<p>He was too high-strung to be a quite rational thinker, and too
lacking in a sense of humor to question his own ideas. His constant lure
was im- agination; reality seemed so drear and gross compared with
conceivable improvements that he tended to take refuge from reality in
the Elysian Fields of his waking dreams. He proposed to do away with
kings, lawyers, and priests; to convert to vegetarianism a world still
in the hunting stage, and to free the love of the sexes from all
trammels of law. He saw no obstacles to all this in the nature of man or
in man’s biological past. “Shelley believed,” said his loving widow,
“that mankind has only to will that there should be no evil, and there
would be none…. This opinion he enter- tained… with fervent enthusiasm.”
124 He almost ignored history, except</p>
<p>We tend to exaggerate Shelley’s simplicity because we forget that
death</p>
<p>Indeed, by the age of twenty-eight Shelley had already cooled to a
re- spectable moderation. In 1820 he wrote a substantial essay called A
Philo- sophical View of Reform, which was published a year later. “Poets
and philosophers,” he announced, “are the unacknowledged legislators of
the world”: 125 poets because th ey are the voices of imagination,
which, amid many absurdities, conceive new ideas that in time stir men
to experiment and advance; philosophers because they bring to social
problems the habit of calm reason and the perspective of years. Like
Byron and every humane spirit of the time, Shelley had been revolted by
the condition of the factory workers in England, and by the cold recipes
of Malthus for controlling the population but leaving wages to be
dictated by the law of supply and de- mand — i.e., by the number of
unemployed competing for available jobs. 126</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>

<p>He denounced both Protestantism and Catholicism for having failed to
apply the spirit of Christ to the relations between rich and poor. 127
He pro- posed to eliminate, by a levy on the rich, the national debt
whose yearly interest charges required heavy taxes upon the general
public. 128 He pointed out that the increase of population between 1689
and 1819 had changed the proportion of voters to nonvoters, leaving the
election of Parliament to an even smaller minority, practically
disenfranchising the people. 129 He forgave the landed aristocracy as
rooted in law and time, and (perhaps with an eye to future Shelleys) he
sanctioned a moderate transmission of wealth; but he scorned the rising
plutocracy of manufacturers, merchants, and financiers. 130 He
repudiated Machiavelli’s exemption of governments from morality:
“Politics are only sound when conducted on principles of morality. They
are, in fact, the morality of nations.” 131 He called for “a republic
governed by one assembly,” but, like his mentor Godwin, advised against
violent revolution. 132 He defended the French Revolution, praised
Napoleon Consul, repudiated Napoleon Emperor, deplored the French de-
feat at Waterloo.</p>

<li>Here the self-exiled poet, now omitting philosophers, exalted poets
as the “supreme lawgivers of the world.” 133 He had expressed th is
comfort- ing opinion in his preface to Prometheus Unbound: “The great
writers of our age are, we have reasons to suppose, the companions and
forerunners of some unimagined change to our social condition or the
opinions which cement it. The cloud of mind is discharging its collected
lightning, and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now
restoring, or is about to be restored.” 134 Now he added: “Our own will
be a memorable age in intellectual achievements, and we live among such
philosophers [Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Schelling — and Godwin] and poets
[Goethe, Schiller, Words- worth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley] as surpass
beyond comparison any who have appeared since the last national struggle
for civil and religi ous liberty” (1642). 135</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast Shelley underestimated the role that science was
beginning to take in remolding ideas and institutions. He warned against
letting the progress of science, which merely improves our tools, outrun
the develop- ment of literature and philosophy, which consider our
purposes; 136 so the “unmitigated exercise of the calculating faculty”
had further enriched the clever few, and had added to the concentration
of wealth and power. 137</p>

</ol>
<p>Byron, when he reached Pisa, had almost outlived his sexual history,
ex- cept for an idealizing memory as in the Haidee episodes in Don Juan.
At Pisa Teresa Guicciou lived with Byron, but in diminishing intimacy;
he spent most of his time with his frien ds and Shelley’s. For them he
arranged weekly dinners, where discussion ran freely. Shelley attended,
stood his ground politely but firmly in argument, but slipped away
before strong drinking began. Teresa tried to give substance to her
quiet life by becoming friends with Mary Shelley and reading history to
keep up with Mary’s intellectual interests. Byron disapproved of
Teresa’s studies, preferring women whose intellect was modestly
subordinated to their charms.</p>
<p>He had almost forgotten Allegra. Her mother pleaded with Mary Shelley
to come to Florence to join her in a plan to go to Ravenna, abduct the
girl, and bring her to a healthier climate and wider life. Shelley
refused to allow this. Then came the news that on April 20, 1822,
Allegra, five years old, had died of malaria in her convent. The event
shared in the cooling of Shelley’s friendship with Byron. Earlier in
this spring he had written to Leigh Hunt: “Particular dispositions in
Lord Byron’s character render the close and exclusive intimacy with him,
in which I find myself,… intoler- able to me. Thus much, my best friend,
I will confess and confide to you.” 139</p>
<p>He tried to conceal his discomfort, for he had persuaded Byron to
invite Hunt to come to Pisa and edit a new magazine, The Liberal, which
Byron and Shelley planned to launch as an offset to the conservative
Quarterly Review. Byron sent the bankrupt Hunt two hundred fifty pounds;
Hunt and family sailed from London, hoping to reach Leghorn on July 1,
1822. Shelley promised to meet him.</p>
<p>Externally the first six months of that fatal year were a pleasant
time for the two poets. They went riding together almost daily, and
matched their marksmanship in a pistol club; Shelley almost equaled
Byron’s a ccuracy of aim. “My health,” he wrote to Peacock, “is better;
my cares lighter; and tho’ nothing will cure the consumption of my
purse, yet it drags on a sort of life in death, very like its master,
and seems, like Fortunatus’ purse, al - ways empty, ye t never quite
exhausted.” 140 In January Byron’s mother -in- law died, leaving him
(despite the separation from his wife) properties that brought him an
additional three thousand pounds per year. Flush, he or- dered a
commodious yacht to be built for himself at Leghorn, appointed John
Trelawny its skipper, named it Bolivar in honor of the South Ameri- can
revolutionist, and invited Shelley and his new friends Edward Williams
and Thomas Medwin to join him and the Gambas in a yachting trip in the
coming summer. Shelley and Williams shared in having a smaller sailboat,
eighty-four feet long, eight in the beam, to be built for them at a cost
of eighty pounds. Trelawny named it Don Juan, Mary renamed it Ariel.

<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>

<p>Looking forward to a summer of boating, Byron engaged the Villa</p>
<p>Dupuy near Leghorn. Shelley and Williams rented for their families
the Casa Magni, near Lerici, on the shores of the Bay of Spezia, some
forty miles north of Leghorn. On April 26, 1822, the Shelleys and
Williams trans- ferred their menages to the Casa Magni, and there
awaited the delivery of their boat.</p>
<ol start="15" type="i">
<li>immolation: shelley, 1822</li>
</ol>
<p>Only some poetic trance could have chosen so lonely a place, or so
wild an environment, for a vacation. Casa Magni was large enough for two
families, but it was unfurnished, and was approaching disintegration. It
was surrounded on three sides by forest, and in front by the sea, whose
waves sometimes reached the door. “Gales and squalls hailed our first
arrival,” Mary Shelley later recalled, and “the natives were wilder than
the place. Had we been wrecked on an island of the South Seas we could
scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilization and comfort.”
142</p>
<p>On May 12 the Ariel arrived from Genoa. Williams, who had been in the
Navy, and Shelley, still unable to swim, were delighted with the boat,
and spent many an afternoon or evening sailing along the coast. Seldom
had Shelley been so happy or so well. Sometimes the women joined them;
but Mary was pregnant again, frequently ill, and unhappy because her
husband would not let her see her father’s plaintive letters. 143</p>
<p>In the house or on the boat Shelley wrote his final poem, “The
Triumph of Life,” which was cut short at line 544 by his final voyage.
There is no triumph in it, for it describes a procession of various
human types, all fail- ures and decayed, hurrying to death. At line 82
the shade of Rousseau rises to explain the stupidity of civilizati on;
he shows history’s famous figures— Plato, Caesar, Constantine, Voltaire,
Napoleon — caught in the same mad rush for wealth or power; and
recommends, as the only escape, a return to a simple and natural
life.</p>
<p>Not yet thirty, Shelley, after thought of suicide on June 18, 1822,
wrote to Trelawny:</p>
<p>Should you meet with any scientific persons capable of preparing the
Prussic acid, or essential oil of bitter almonds, I should regard it as
a great kindness if you would procure me a small quantity…. I would give
any price for this medicine…. I need not tell you I have no intention of
suicide at present, but I confess it would be a comfort to me to hold in
my possession that golden key to the chamber of perpetual rest. 144</p>
<p>Perhaps to help his sick wife, Shelley had invited Claire Clairmont
to come from Florence and spend the summer at Casa Magni. She came early
in June, in time to help Mary through an almost fatal miscarriage. On
June 22 Shelley, nearing a nervous breakdown, suffered a nightmare so
terrifying that he ran from his room to Mary screaming.</p>

<p>On July i news reached them that Leigh Hunt and family had reached
Genoa, and were preparing to leave it by a local transport vessel to
join Byron at Leghorn. Shelley, anxious to welcome his faithful friend,
to ease Byron’s reception of him, and to strengthen his partner’s fading
interest in their new magazine, decided to sail at once in the Ariel
with Williams for Leghorn. Mar y had premonitions of disaster. “I called
Shelley back two or three times…. I cried bitterly when he went away.”
148</p>
<p>The Ariel left Casa Magni at noon July i, and reached Leghorn
safely</p>
<p>at nine that evening. Shelley greeted Hunt joyfully, but was
depressed to learn that the Tuscan authorities had ordered the Gambas to
leave their territory at once, and that Byron, resolved to follow
Teresa, was planning to leave Leghorn soon to join her in Genoa.
Nevertheless Byron agreed to honor his agreement with Hunt, and to have
the Hunts occupy rooms in the Casa Lanfranchi at Pisa. Shelley
accompanied them to Pisa, saw them settled, and drove back to Leghorn on
July 7.</p>
<p>He spent the morning of Monday, July 8, shopping for the family
at</p>
<p>Casa Magni. Williams urged him to hurry, to catch the favorable wind
then blowing toward Lerici. Captain Roberts of the Bolivar predicted a
storm for that afternoon, and advised a day’s delay; Williams urged im -
mediate departure; Shelley agreed; and about half past one that
afternoon the Ariel sailed from Leghorn with Shelley, Williams, and a
young sailor, Charles Vivian.</p>
<p>About six-thirty that evening a heavy storm, with thunder, wind, and
rain, fell upon the Bay of Spezia, and hundreds of vessels hurried into
harbor. At Casa Magni the storm was so severe that the three women wait-
ing anxiously there comforted themselves with the conclusion that the
two husbands had waited out the storm at Leghorn. Then Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday passed. “The real anguish of these moments,”
Mary later wrote, “transcends all the fictions that the most glowing
imagination ever portrayed. Our seclusion, the savage nature of the
inhabitants of the neigh- boring village, and our immediate vicinity to
the troubled sea, combined to imbue with strange horror our days of
uncertainty.” 148 On Friday a letter</p>

<p>19 he returned to them, and revealed to them, as gently as he could,
that the corpses of their husbands had been found washed upon the shore
near Viareggio on July 17 or 18. (About July 30 the mutilated body of
Charles Vivian was found four miles farther north, and was buried on the
shore.) He took Mary and Jane to Pisa, where Byron offered them rooms in
the Casa Lanfranchi, but they took quarters nearby. Mary wrote to a
friend: “Lord Byron is very kind to me, and comes with the Guiccioli to
see us often.” 147</p>
<p>The bodies had already been buried in the sands by natives. Tuscan
law forbade such buried corpses to be exhumed or reburied; but Trelawny
knew that Mrs. Shelley wished Shelley’s remains to be interred near
those of their son William in Rome. He persuaded the Tuscan authorities
to al- low exhumation, on condition that the remains be burned on the
shore. The bodies had been mutilated or consumed almost beyond
recognition; but in one jacket a volume of Sophocles was found in one
pocket and a volume of Keats in the other. 148</p>
<p>On August 1 5 Byron, Hunt, and Trelawny, with a quarantine official
and an English officer, Captain Shenley, stood by as a squad of soldiers
burned the remains of Williams. The next day, at a spot across from
Elba, the re- mains of Shelley were exhumed and burned in the presence
of Byron, Hunt, Trelawny, and some neighboring villagers. Into the
flames Trelawny threw incense, wine, and oil, and pronounced
incantations consigning the ashes to “the Nature which he worshipped.”

<ol start="16" type="I">
<li>TRANSFIGURATION: BYRON, 1 82 2-24</li>
</ol>
<p>In September, 1822, Byron and the Gambas moved from Pisa to Albaro, a
suburb of Genoa. The several moves of body, mind, and mood that he had
made since leaving England had tired him, and he had begun to tire even
of Teresa’s untiring love. His sharp eyes and sardonic spirit had re -
moved the veils of life, and apparently had left no reality that could
stir him to idealism or devotion. He was the most famous living poet,
but he was not proud of his poetry; the febrile plaints of Childe Harold
seemed unmanly now, and the clever cynicism of Don Juan left author and
reader naked in a disillusioned world. “A man,” he now felt, “ought to
do something more for mankind than write verses.” 150 At Genoa he asked
his physician to tell him “which is the best and quickest poison?”
151</p>
<p>Greece offered him a redeeming death. It had fallen subject to the
Turks</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>in 1465, and had become somnolent under alien domination. Byron, in
Childe Harold (Canto 11, lines 73-84), had ca lled upon it to revolt:
“Heredi - tary bondsmen! Know ye not / Who would be free themselves must
strike the blow?” Greece had revolted in 1821, but it was without arms,
without money, without unity; it was crying out for help from the
nations to which it had transmitted its rich inheritance. It had sent a
committee to London to seek funds; the committee sent representatives to
Genoa with a challenge to Byron to use some of his wealth in furthering
the revolution he had sought to inspire. On April 7, 1823, he told the
emissaries that he was at the service of the Greek Provisional
Government.</p>
<p>He was transformed. He was now all action. Cynicism gave way to dedi-
cation; poetry was laid aside; romance graduated from rhymes to
resolution. After putting aside some funds for the Hunts and above all
for Teresa, he devoted the remainder of his fortune to the Greek
Revolution. He instructed his agents in London to sell everything of his
in England that could bring money, and to send him the proceeds. He sold
the Bolivar for half its cost, and engaged an English vessel, the
Hercules, to take him, Pietro Gamba, and Trelawny to Greece with some
cannon and ammunition, and with medical supplies for a thousand men for
two years. Teresa Guiccioli strug- gled to keep him with her; he
resisted her affectionately, and had the con- solation of knowing that
she and her parents had received permission to return to their home in
Ravenna. He told Lady Blessington: “I have a</p>
<p>presentiment that I shall die in Greece. I hope it may be in action,
for that would be a good finish to a very triste existence.” 152</p>
<p>On July 16, 1823, the Hercules left Genoa for Greece. After
exasperating delays it anchored (August 3) at Argostolion, the port of
Cephalonia, largest of the Ionian Islands. This was still fifty miles
from Greece, but Byron was forced to fret away months there; he had
hoped to join, at Missolonghi, the most inspiring of the Greek leaders;
but Marco Bozzaris had been killed in action, Missolonghi was in Turkish
hands, and Turkish warships controlled all western approaches to the
Greek mainland. Early in December Prince Alexandros Mavrokordatos
recaptured Missolonghi, and on the 29th Byron left Cephalonia. Colonel
Leicester Stanhope, agent of the Greek committee that was raising funds
in England to aid the revolu- tion, wrote from Missolonghi: “All are
looking forward to Lord Byron’s arrival as they would be to the coming
of the Messiah.” 153 After several adventures and delays the young
savior reached Missolonghi, January 4, 1824, and received a joyous
welcome from prince and people scenting gold.</p>
<p>Mavrokordatos commissioned him to pay, provision, and lead a squad of
six hundred Suliotes — bellicose barbarians part Greek, part Albanian.
He was not inspired by their appearance, and he knew that the Greek
revolu- tionists were divided into rival factions under leaders more
political than martial. Nevertheless he was happy to have been assigned
an active role, and did not delay in dispensing aid; to Mavrokordatos
alone he gave some two thousand pounds a week to keep the Missolonghians
in food and spirit. Meanwhile he lived in a villa north of the town and
near the shore, “on the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXII )</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>verge,” said Trelawny, “of the most dismal swamp I have ever seen.”
The Suliotes proved disorderly and rebellious, more anxious to get his
money than his leadership; the young Lochinvar’s hope for martial action
had to wait till order and morale had been restored. Trelawny, never
good at waiting, went off to seek adventure elsewhere. Only Pietro Gamba
re- mained close to Byron, watching over him anxiously as he saw him
failing under the heat, the worry, and the malarial air.</p>
<p>On February 15, visiting Colonel Stanhope, Byron suddenly grew pale
and fell to the ground in convulsions, unconscious, and foaming at the
mouth. He recovered consciousness, and was taken to his villa. Doctors
gathered around him, and applied leeches to bleed him. When these were
removed the bleeding could not be soon stopped, and Byron fainted from
loss of blood. On February 18 his Suliotes rioted again, threatening to
in- vade his villa and kill all available foreigners. He rose from his
bed and calmed them, but his hope to lead them against the Turks at
Lepanto faded, and with it his dream of a fruitful and heroic death. He
was comforted by a letter from Augusta Leigh, enclosing a picture of his
daughter Ada and Annabella’s description of the child’s habits and
temperament. His eyes lighted with a moment’s happiness. Everything
normal had been denied him.</p>
<p>On April 9 he went out riding with Pietro. They were caught in a
heavy rain on their way back, and Byron that evening suffered chills and
fever. On the 1 ith his fever grew worse; he took to his bed, felt his
strength ebb- ing, and recognized that he was dying. Sometimes, in those
last ten days, he thought of religion, but “to say the truth,” he
remarked, “I find it equally</p>
<p>It is with infinite regret that I must state that, although I seldom
left Lord Byron’s pillow during the latter part of his illness, I did
not hear him make any, even the smallest, mention of religion. At one
moment I heard him say, “Shall I sue for mercy?” After a long pause he
added: “Come, come; no weakness! Let’s be a man to the end.”</p>
<p>The same doctor quotes him as saying, “Let not my body be sent to Eng
- land. Here let my bones molder. Lay me in the first corner without
pomp or nons ense.” 155</p>
<p>On April 1 5, after another convulsion, he allowed the doctors to
bleed him again. They took two pounds of blood, and, two hours later,
another. He died on April 19, 1824. The unusually incompetent autopsy
showed uremia — the poisonous accumulation, in the blood, of elements
that should have been eliminated in the urine. There was no sign of
syphilis, but much evidence that repeated bleedings and strong
cathartics had been the final causes of death. The brain was one of the
largest ever recorded — 710 grams above the top range for normal men.
156 Perhaps years of sexual excess, and alternate periods of heavy
eating and reckless fasts, had weakened the body’s resources against

<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>News of the death did not reach London till May 14. Hobhouse brought
it to Augusta Leigh; the two broke down together. Hobhouse then turned
to the problem of Byron’s secret memoirs. Moore had sold these for two
thousand guineas to Murray, who was tempted to send them to the press
despite warning from his chief adviser, William Gifford, that (in Hob-
house’s words) they were “fit only for the brothel, and would doom Lord
Byron to everlasting infamy if published.” 157 Murray and Hobhouse pro -
posed to destroy the manuscript; Moore protested, but agreed to let
Mrs. Leigh decide; she asked that it be burned; it was done. Moore
returned two thousand guineas to Murray.</p>
<p>Byron’s old servant, Fletcher, insisted tha t his master, shortly
before death, had expressed a wish to be buried in England. The Greek
authorities and populace protested, but they had to be content with
parts of the viscera removed before embalming. The body, preserved in
180 gallons of spirits, reached London on June 29. A request was made to
the authorities of West- minster Abbey to let the corpse be buried in
the Poets’ Corner there; per - mission was refused. On July 9-10 the
public was allowed to view the coffined remains; many people came, very
few of note; but some digni- taries allowed their empty carriages to
take part in the procession that carried the corpse from London, July
12-15, to Nottingham. From a win- dow Claire Clairmont and Mary Shelley
saw the funeral move by. Farther along it passed an open carriage
bearing Caroline Lamb; her husband, riding ahead, learned the name of
the dead, but did not, till days later, reveal it to his wife. On July
16 the poet was buried in the vault of his ancestors, beside his mother,
in the parish church of Hucknall Torkard, a village near New- stead
Abbey.</p>

<li>SURVIVORS</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those who had played a part in Byron’s drama, most survived far
into the next epoch of history. Soonest to pass was Pietro Gamba; after
escorting his hero’s body to London he returned to Greece, remained
faithful to the revolution, and died there of fever in 1827. — Lady
Caroline Lamb became “very ill” when her husband told her that Byron’s
corpse had passed her; she had satirized him in a novel, Glenarvon
(1816), but now she said, “I am very sorry I ever said one unkind word
against him.” 158 She survived him by less than four years. — Augusta
Leigh inherited, by Byron’s will, nearly all (some one hundred thousand
pounds) that remain ed of his fortune; spent most of it paying the
gambling debts of her husband and her sons, and died in poverty in 1 85
2. 158 — Lady Byron kept to the end some tenderness for the man whose
inherited devils had cursed her mar- riage; “As long as I live,” she
wrote, “my chief difficulty will probably be not to remember him too
kindly.” 160 “Can I not be believed when, after</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>THE REBEL POETS</p>
<p>5&lt;M</p>
<p>could destroy?” 161 Their daughter Ada, on whose development Byron
had set such hopes, married the second Earl of Lovelace, lost a fortune
gambling on horses, was saved from financial disaster by her mother,
lost hope and health, and died, like her father, at the age of
thirty-six (1852); Lady Byron, trying to fill her lonely life with
social services, died in 1 860.</p>
<p>John Cam Hobhouse entered Parliament as a radical, rose to be
secretary at war (1832-33), became a baron, and died in 1869 at the age
of eighty- three. Teresa Guiccioli, after Byron’s death, returned to her
husband, but soon applied for, and received, a second separation. She
had brief affairs with Byron’s lame friend Henry Fox, and with Byron’s
admirer the French</p>
<p>Mary Shelley, despite some hurts, kept a more favorable view of
“Albe” (as his circle had nicknamed Byron); when she learned of his
death she wrote: “Albe— the dear, capricious, fascinating Albe — has
left this desert world! God grant that I may die young!” 164 She spent
much of her re - maining twenty- seven years editing her husband’s works
with love and care, and a quiet eloquence of her own.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt, who had dared to praise Shelley’s poetry when nearly all
critics condemned it as the vagaries of an unfinished adolescence,
remained faithful to his youthful radicalism, wrote hostile memories of
Byron, and lasted till 1859. Thomas Jefferson Hogg, after outliving
various infatua- tions, married Williams’ widow Jane, and lived with her
the last thirty -five years of his life. The most remarkable of these
epigoni was Edward John Trelawny, who came into Shelley’s life at Pisa,
when both wer e entering their thirtieth year. Shelley was nearing his
end, Trelawny had still fifty- nine years to live. But already this
“knight -errant,… dark, handsome, and mustachioed” (as Hunt described
him), had had so many adventures, in so many countries, that his
reminiscences never bored his new friends. Though Byron made him master
of the horse and of Bolivar, it was Shelley, this “mild - mannered,
beardless boy,” whom this man of action learned most to love. After
seeing Byron safely arrived but immobilized at Missolonghi, he went off
to seek his own fate, expecting to die in the cause of Greece. He saw
Greece liberated, resumed his wandering, lived till 1881, and was buried
in the grave that he had bought in 1822, next to Shelley’s ashes in the
English cemetery at Rome.</p>
