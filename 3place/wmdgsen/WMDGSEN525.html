<h4 id="chapter-vii-rousseau-philosopher">CHAPTER VII Rousseau
Philosopher</h4>
<p>I. THE SOCIAL CONTRACT</p>
<p>T WO months before the publication of La Nouvelle Helotse, Rousseau
wrote to M. Lenieps (December 1 i, 1760):</p>
<p>I have quit the profession of author for good. There remains an old
sin to be expiated in print, after which the public will never hear from
me again. I know of no happier lot than that of being unknown save only
to one’s friends…. Henceforth copying [music] will be my only
occupation. 1</p>
<p>And again on June 25, 1761:</p>
<p>Until the age of forty I was wise; at forty I took up the pen; and I
put it down before I am fifty, cursing, every day of my life, the day
when my foolish pride made me take it up, and when I saw my happiness,
my repose, my health, all go up in smoke without hope of recapturing
them again. 2</p>
<p>Was this a pose? Not quite. It is true that in 1762 he published both
Du Contrat social and Emile; but these had been completed by 1761; they
were the “old sin to be expiated in print.” And it is true that he later
w rote replies to the Archbishop of Paris, to the Geneva Consistory, and
to the requests from Corsica and Poland to propose constitutions for
them; but these composi- tions were pieces (^occasion , induced by
unforeseen events. The Conces- sions^ the Dialogues , and the Reveries
(Tun promeneur solitaire were pub- lished after his death. Essentially
he kept to his novel vow. It is no wonder that in 1761 he felt exhausted
and finished, for in the space of five years he had composed three major
works, each of which was an event in the history of ideas.</p>
<p>Far back in 1743, when he was secretary to the French ambassador in
Venice, his observation of the Venetian government in contrast with the
Genevan and the French had led him to plan a substantial treatise on
political institutions. The two Discourses were sparks from that fire,
but they were hasty attempts to get attention by exaggeration, and
neither of them did justice to his developing thought. Meanwhile he
studied Plato, Grotius, Locke, and Pufendorf. The magnum opus that he
dreamed of was never completed. Rousseau did not have the ordered mind,
patient will, and quiet temper needed for such an enterprise. It would
have required him to reason as well as feel, to conceal passion rather
than reveal it; and such self-denial was beyond his reach. His
renunciation of authorship was his admission of defeat. But he gave the
world in 1762 a brilliant fragment of his plan in the 125 pages
published at Amsterdam as Du Contrat social , ou Principes du droit
politique.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the bold cry that opened the first chapter: “ Uhomme
est</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>ne libre, et par tout il est dans les fers” (Man is bom free, and he
is everywhere</p>
<p>There is a social contract, says Rousseau, not as a pledge of the
ruled to obey the ruler (as in Hobbes’s Leviathan), but as an agreement
of indi - viduals to subordinate their judgment, rights, and powers to
the needs and judgment of their community as a whole. Each person
implicitly enters into such a contract by accepting the protection of
the communal laws. The sovereign power in any state lies not in any
ruler — individual or corporate — but in the general will of the
community; and that sovereignty, though it may be delegated in part and
for a time, can never be surrendered.</p>
<p>But what is this volonte generate? Is it the will of all the
citizens, or only of the majority? — and who are to be considered
citizens? It is not the will of all ( volonte de tous) , for it may
contradict many an individual will. Nor is it always the will of the
majority living [or voting] at some particular mo- ment; it is the will
of the community as having a life and reality additional to the lives
and wills of the individual members. [Rousseau, like a medieval
“realist,” ascribes to the collectivity, or general idea, a reality
additional to</p>
<p>Ideally, says Rousseau, law should be the expression of the general
will. Man is by nature predominantly good, but he has instincts that
must be con- trolled to make society possible. There is no idealization
of a “state of nature”</p>
<p>The material in brackets is tentative interpretation, and is not
explicitly in Rousseau.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>I 73</p>
<p>The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a
very re- markable change in man, by substituting law for instinct in his
conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked….
Although, in this [civil] state, he deprives himself of some advantages
which he had from nature, he gains in return others so great, his
faculties are so stimulated and developed, his ideas so extended, and
his whole soul so uplifted, that, did not the abuses of his new
condition often degrade him below that which he left, he would be bound
to bless continually the happy moment which took him from it forever,
and instead of a stupid and unimaginative animal, made him an
intelligent being and a man. 7</p>
<p>So Rousseau (who once talked like a not quite philosophical
anarchist) is now all for the sanctity of law, if the law expresses the
general will. If, as often happens, an individual does not agree with
that will as expressed in law, the state may justly force him to submit.
8 This is not a violation of free- dom, it is a preservation of it, even
for the refractory individual; for in a civil state it is only through
law that the individual can enjoy freedom from assault, robbery,
persecution, calumny, and a hundred other ills. Hence, in compelling the
individual to obey the law, society in effect “forces him to be free.” 9
This is especially so in republics, for “obedience to a law which we
prescribe to ourselves is liberty.” 10</p>
<p>Government is an executive organ to which the general will
provisionally delegates some of its powers. The state should be thought
of not as only the government, but as the government, the citizens, and
the general will or communal soul. Any state is a republic if it is
governed by laws and not by autocratic decrees; in this sense even a
monarchy can be a republic. But if the monarchy is absolute — if the
king makes as well as executes the laws — then there is no res publica,
or commonwealth, there is only a tyrant ruling slaves. Hence Rousseau
refused to join those philosophes who praised the “enlightened
despotism” of Frederick II or Catherine II as means of advanc - ing
civilization and reform. He thought that peoples living in arctic or
tropi- cal climates might need absolute rule to preserve life and order
; 11 but in temperate zones a mixture of aristocracy and democracy is
desirable. Heredi- tary aristocracy is “the worst of all governments”;
“elective aristocracy” is the best ; 12 i.e., the best government is one
in which the laws are made and administered by a minority of men
periodically chosen for their intellectual and moral superiority.</p>
<p>Democracy, as direct rule by all the people, seemed to Rousseau im-
possible:</p>
<p>If we take the term in the strict sense, there never has been a real
democracy, and there never will be. It is against the natural order for
the many to govern and the few to be governed. It is unimaginable that
the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to
public affairs, and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for
that purpose without changing the form of administration….</p>
<p>Besides, how many conditions difficult to unite are presupposed by
such a government? First, a very small state, where the people can be
readily assem- bled, and where each citizen can with ease know all the
rest; secondly, great simplicity of manners, to prevent business from
multiplying and raising thorny</p>
<p>r 74</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>problems; next, a large measure of equality in rank and fortune,
without which equality of rights and authority cannot long subsist; and
lastly, little or no luxury, for luxury corrupts at once the rich and
the poor — the rich by posses- sion and the poor by covetousness…. This
is why a famous writer [Mon- tesquieu] has made virtue the fundamental
principle of republics, for all these conditions could not exist without
virtue…. If there were a people of gods, their government would be
democratic, but so perfect a government is not for men. 13</p>
<p>These passages invite misinterpretation. Rousseau uses the term
democracy in a sense rarely ascribed to it in politics or history, as a
government in which all laws are made by the whole people meeting in
national assemblies. Actu- ally the “elective aristocracy” that he
preferred is what we should call repre - sentative democracy —
government by officials popularly chosen for their supposedly superior
fitness. However, Rousseau rejects representative de- mocracy on the
ground that the representatives will soon legislate for their own
interest rather than for the public good. “The people of England re -
gards itself as free, but it is grossly mistaken; it is free only during
the elec- tion of members of Parliament; as soon as they are chosen,
slavery overtakes the people, and it ceases to count.” 14
Representatives should be elected to administrative and judicial
offices, but not to legislate; all laws should be made by the people in
general assembly, and that assembly should have the power to recall
elected officials. 15 Hence the ideal state should be small enough to
allow all the citizens to assemble frequently. “The larger the state,
the less the liberty.” 16</p>
<p>Was Rousseau a socialist? The second Discourse derived almost all the
evils of civilization from the establishment of private property; yet
even that essay judged the institution to be too deeply rooted in the
social struc- ture to permit its removal without a chaotic and
desolating revolution. The Social Contract allows for private ownership,
but subject to communal con- trol; the community should retain all basic
rights, it may seize private prop- erty for the common good, and it
should fix a maximum of property allow- able to any one family. 17 It
may sanction the bequest of property, but if it sees wealth tending to a
disruptive concentration it may use inheritance taxes to redistribute
wealth and dimin ish social and economic inequality. “It is precisely
because the force of things tends always to destroy equality that
legislation should always tend to maintain it.” 18 One purpose of the
social contract is that “men who may be unequal in strength or
intelligence shall all become equal in social and legal rights.” 19
Taxes should fall heavily upon luxuries. “The social state is
advantageous to men only when all have something and no one has too
much.” 20 Rousseau did not commit himself to collectivism, and never
thought of a “dictatorship of the proletariat”; he despised the nascent
proletariat of the cities, and agreed with Voltaire in calling it
“canaille”— rabble, scum. 21 His ideal was a prosperous, independent
peasantry and a virtu ous middle class composed of families like
Wolmar’s in La Nouvelle Heloise. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was to accuse
him of enthron- ing the bourgeoisie. 22</p>
<p>What place should religion have in the state? Some religion, Rousseau
felt,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>1 75</p>
<p>was indispensable to morality; “no state has ever been established
without a religious basis.” 23</p>
<p>Wise men, if they try to speak their language to the common herd
instead of its own, cannot possibly make themselves understood…. For a
young people to be able to prefer sound principles of political theory…
the effect would have to become the cause: the social spirit which
should be created by these institutions would have to preside over their
very foundation; and men would have to be before law what they should
become by means of law. The legislator, therefore, being unable to
appeal to either force or reason, must have recourse to an authority of
a different order, capable of constraining without violence…. This is
what in all ages compelled the fathers of nations to have recourse to
divine intervention, and credit the gods with their own wisdom, in order
that the peoples, submitting to the laws of the state as to those of
nature,… might obey freely, and bear with docility the yoke of the
public good. 24</p>
<p>Rousseau would not always hold to this old political view of
religion, but in The Social Contract he made supernatural belief an
instrument of the state, and considered priests to be at best a kind of
celestial police. However, he rejected the Roman Catholic clergy as such
agents, for their Church claimed to be above the state, and was
therefore a disruptive force, dividing the citizen’s loyalty. 25
Moreover (he argued) , the Christian, if he takes his theology
seriously, focuses his attention upon the afterlife, and puts little
value upon this one; to that extent he is a poor citizen. Such a
Christian makes an indifferent soldier; he may fight for his country,
but only under constant compulsion and supervision; he does not believe
in waging war for the state, because he has only one fatherland — the
Church. Christianity preaches servitude and docile dependence; hence its
spirit is so favorable to tyranny that tyrants welcome its co-
operation. “True Christians are made to be slaves.” 26 Here Rousseau
agreed with Diderot, anticipated Gibbon, and was for the moment more
violently anti-Catholic than Voltaire.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he felt, some religion is necessary, some “civil
religion” formulated by the state and made compulsory upon all its
population. As to creed:</p>
<p>The dogmas of the civil religion ought to be few, simple, and
precisely worded, but without explanation or commentary. The existence
of a mighty, intelligent, and beneficent Divinity, possessed of
foresight and providence; the life to come, the happiness of the just,
the punishment of the wicked, the sanctity of the social contract and
the laws; these are its positive dogmas. 27</p>
<p>So Rousseau, at least for political purposes, professed the basic
beliefs of Christianity, while rejecting its ethics as too pacifistic
and international — just the reverse of the usual philosophic procedure
of retaining the ethics of Christianity while discarding its theology.
He allowed other religions in his imaginary state, but only on condition
that they did not contradict the offi- cial creed. He would tolerate
those religions “that tolerate others,” but “whoever dares to say,
‘Outside the Church there is no salvation,’ ought to be driven from the
state, unless the state is the Church, and the prince is</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>he pontiff” thereof. 28 No denial of the articles in the religion of
the state is to be permitted.</p>
<p>While the state can compel no one to believe them, it can banish him,
not for impiety, but as an antisocial being, incapable of truly loving
the laws and justice, and of sacrificing, at need, his life to his duty.
If anyone, after publicly recognizing these dogmas, behaves as if he
does not believe them, let him be punished by death. 29</p>
<p>Next to “Man is born free, and is everywhere in chains,” this last is
the most famous sentence in The Social Contract. Taken literally, it
would put to death any person acting as if he had no belief in God,
heaven, or hell; ap- plied to the Paris of that time, it would have
almost depopulated the capital. Rousseau’s love of startling and
absolute statements probably misled him into saying more than he meant.
Perhaps he recalled the Diet of Augsburg (1555), at which the signatory
princes agreed that each of them should have the right to banish from
his territory any person not accepting the prince’s faith — cuius regio
eius religio; and the laws of Geneva, taken literally (as in the case of
Servetus), provided an antecedent for Rousseau’s sudden sav - agery.
Ancient Athens had made asebeia — failure to recognize the official gods
— a capital crime, as in exiling Anaxagoras and poisoning Socrates; the
persecution of Christians by Imperial Rome was similarly excused; and on
Rousseau’s penology the order for his arrest, in this year 1762, could
be described as an act of Christian charity.</p>
<p>Was The Social Contract a revolutionary book? No and yes. Here and
there, amid Rousseau’s demand for a government responsible to the
general will, some moments of caution calmed him, as when he wrote:
“None but the greatest dangers can counterbalance that of changing the
public order; and the sacred power of the laws should never be arrested
save when the ex- istence of the country is at stake.” 30 He blamed
private property for nearly all evils, but he called for its maintenance
as made necessary by the incorrigible corruption of mankind. He wondered
whether the nature of man would, after a revolution, reproduce old
institutions and servitudes under new names. “People accustomed to
masters will not let mastery cease…. Mis - taking liberty for unchained
license, they are delivered by their revolutions into the hands of
seducers who will only aggravate their chains.” 31</p>
<p>Nevertheless his was the most revolutionary voice of the time. Though
elsewhere he belittled and distrusted the masses, here his appeal was to
the multitude. He knew that inequality is inevitable, but he condemned
it with force and eloquence. He announced unequivocally that a
government per- sistently contravening the general will might justly be
overthrown. While Voltaire, Diderot, and d’Alembert were curt sying to
kings or empresses, Rousseau raised against existing governments a cry
of protest that was destined to be heard from one end of Europe to the
other. While the philo- sophes , already embedded in the status quo,
called only for piecemeal reform of particular ills, Jean- Jacques
attacked the whole economic, social, and po- litical order, and with
such thoroughness that no remedy seemed possible but revolution. And he
announced its coming: “It is impossible that the great</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>I?7</p>
<p>kingdoms of Europe should last much longer. Each of them has had its
period of splendor, after which it must inevitably decline. The crisis
is ap- proaching: we are on the edge of a revolution.” 32 And beyond
this he pre - dicted far- reaching transformations: “The Empire of
Russia will aspire to conquer Europe, and will itself be conquered. The
Tatars — its subjects or neighbors — will become its masters and ours,
by a revolution which I con- sider inevitable.” 33</p>
<p>The Social Contact, which in hindsight we perceive to have been the
most revolutionary of Rousseau’s works, made far less stir than La
Nouvelle Heloise. France was ready for emotional release and romantic
love, but it was not ready to discuss the overthrow of the monarchy.
This book was the most sustained argument that Rousseau had yet
produced, and it was not as easy to follow as the sparkling vivacities
of Voltaire. Impressed by its later vogue, we are surprised to learn
that its popularity and influence be- gan after, not before, the
Revolution. 34 Even so we find d’Alembert writing to Voltaire in 1762:
“It will not do to speak too loudly against Jean -Jacques or his book,
for he is rather a king in the Halles” 35 — i.e., among the burly
workers in the central market of Paris, and, by implication, among the
pop- ulace. This was probably an exaggeration, but we may date from 1762
the turn of philosophy from attack upon Christianity to criticism of the
state.</p>
<p>Few books have ever aroused so much criticism. Voltaire marked his
copy of Du Contrat social with marginal rejoinders; so, on Rousseau’s
prescription of death for active unbelief: “All coercion on dogma is
abominable.” 36 Scholars have reminded us how old was the claim that
sovereignty lies in the people: Marsilius of Padua, William of Ockham,
even Catholic theologians like Bellarmine, Mariana, and Suarez had put
forth that claim as a blow be- hind the knees of kings. It had appeared
in the writings of George Buchanan, Grotius, Milton, Algernon Sidney,
Locke, Pufendorf… The Social Con- tract , like nearly all of Rousseau’s
political and moral philosophy, is an echo and reflex of Geneva by a
citizen distant enough to idealize it without feeling its claws. The
book was an amalgam of Geneva and Sparta, of Calvin’s Insti - tutes and
Plato’s Laws.</p>
<p>A hundred critics have pointed out the inconsistency between the
individ- ualism of Rousseau’s Discourses and the legalism of The Social
Contract. Long before Rousseau’s birth Filmer, in Patriarcha (1642), had
disposed of the notion that man is born free; he is born subject to
paternal authority and to the laws and customs of his group. Rousseau
himself, after that initial cry for freedom, moved further and further
from liberty toward order — toward submission of the individual to the
general will. Basically the contradictions in his works lay between his
character and his thought; he was a rebel in- dividualist by
temperament, ailment, and lack of formal discipline; he was a
communalist (never a communist, not even a collectivist) by his tardy
per- ception that no operative society can be composed of mavericks. We
must allow for development: a man’s ideas are a functi on of his
experience and his years; it is natural for a thinking person to be an
individualist in youth- loving liberty and grasping for ideals — and a
moderate in maturity, loving</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>order and reconciled to the possible. Emotionally Rousseau remained
always a child, resenting conventions, prohibitions, laws; but when he
reasoned he came to realize that within the restrictions necessary for
social order many freedoms can remain; and he ended by perceiving that
in a community liberty is not the victim but the product of law — that
it is enlarged rather than lessened by general obedience to restraints
collectively self-imposed. Philosophical anarchists and political
totalitarians alike can quote Rousseau to their purpose, 37 and alike
unjustly, for he recognized that order is free- dom’s first law, and the
order that he spoke for was to be the expression of the general
will.</p>
<p>Rousseau denied any real contradictions in his philosoph y. “All my
ideas are consistent, but I cannot expound them all at once.” 38 He
admitted that his book “needs rewriting, but I have neither the strength
nor the time to do it”; 39 when he had the strength, persecution took
away his time, and when persecution ceased, and time was given, strength
had been worn away. In those later years he grew doubtful of his own
arguments. “Those who pride themselves on thoroughly understanding The
Social Contract are cleverer than I am.” 40 In practice he quite ignored
the principles he had there</p>

<p>We can forgive much to an author who could, within fifteen months,
send forth La Nouvelle Helo’ise (February, 1761), The Social Contract
(April,</p>
<p>1762), and Emile (May, 1762). All three were published in Amsterdam,
but Emile was published also in Paris, with governmental permission
secured at great risk by the kindly Malesherbes. Marc-Michel Rey, the
Amsterdam publisher, deserves a passing salute. Having made unexpected
profits from Helo’ise, he settled upon Therese a life annuity of three
hundred livres; and foreseeing a greater sale for Emile than for Du
Contrat social (which he had bought for a thousand livres), he paid
Jean- Jacques six thousand livres for the new and longer manuscript.</p>
<p>The book originated partly from discussions with Mme. d’Epinay on the
education of her son, and took its first form as a minor essay written
“to please a good mother who was able to think”— Mme. de Chenonceaux,
daughter of Mme. Dupin. Rousseau thought of it as a sequel to La
Nouvelle Helo’ise: how should Julie’s children be brought up? For a
moment he doubted whether a man who had sent all his children to a
foundling asylum, and who had failed as a tutor in the Mably family, was
fit to talk on parent- age and education; but as usual he found it
pleasant to give his imagination</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>l 19</p>
<p>free rein, unhampered by experience. He studied Montaigne’s Essays ,
Fene - lon’s Telemaque, Rollin’s Traite des etudes, and Locke’s Some
Thoughts on Education. His own first Discourse was a challenge to him,
for it had pic- tured man as good by nature but spoiled by civilization,
including education. Could that natural goodness be preserved and
developed by right education? Helvetius had just given an affirmative
answer in De /’ Esprit (1758), but he had presented an argument rather
than a plan.</p>
<p>Rousseau began by rejecting existing methods as teaching, usually by
rote, worn-out and corrupt ideas; as trying to make the child an
obedient automaton in a decaying society; as preventing the child from
thinking and judging for himself; as deforming him into a mediocrity and
brandishing platitudes and classic tags. Such schooling suppressed all
natural impulses, and made education a torture which every child longed
to avoid. But education should be a happy process of natural unfolding,
of learning from nature and experience, of freely developing one’s
capacities into full and zestful living. It should be the “art of
training men”: 41 the conscious guidance of the grow - ing body to
health, of the character to morality, of the mind to intelligence, of
the feelings to self-control, sociability, and happiness.</p>
<p>Rousseau would have wanted a system of public instruction by the
state, but as public instruction was then directed by the Church, he
prescribed a private instruction by an unmarried tutor who would be paid
to devote many years of his life to his pupil. The tutor should withdraw
the child as much as possible from its parents and relatives, lest it be
infected with the accumulated vices of civilization. Rousseau humanized
his treatise by imagin- ing himself entrusted with almost full authority
over the rearing of a very malleable youth called f’mile. It is quite
incredible, but Rousseau managed to make these 450 pages the most
interesting book ever written on education. When Kant picked up Emile he
became so absorbed that he forgot to take his daily walk. 42</p>
<p>If nature is to be the tutor’s guide, he will give the child as much
freedom as safety will allow. He will begin by persuading the nurse to
free the babe from swaddling clothes, for these impede its growth and
the proper develop- ment of its limbs. Next, he will have the mother
suckle her child instead of turning it over to a wet nurse; for the
nurse may injure the child by harsh- ness or neglect, or may earn from
it, by conscientious care, the love that should naturally be directed to
the mother as the first source and bond of family unity and moral order.
Here Rousseau wrote lines that had an ad- mirable effect upon the young
mothers of the rising generation:</p>
<p>Would you restore all men to their primal duties? — begin with the
mother; the results will surprise vou. Every evil follows in the train
of this first sin…. The mother whose children are out of sight wins
scanty esteem; there is no home life, the ties of nature are not
strengthened bv those of habit; fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters
cease to exist. They are almost strangers; how should they love one
another? Each thinks of himself.</p>
<p>But when mothers deign to nurse their own children, there will be a
reform in morals; natural feeling will revive in every heart; there will
be no lack of citizens for the state; this first step will by itself
restore mutual affection. The</p>
<p>i8o</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>charms of home are the best antidote of vice. The noisy play of
children, which we thought so trying, becomes a delight; mother and
father… grow dearer to each other; the marriage tie is strengthened….
Thus the cure of this one evil would work a widespread reformation;
nature would regain her rights. When women become good mothers men will
become good husbands and fathers. 43</p>
<p>These famous paragraphs made breast feeding by mothers part of the
change in manners that began in the final decade of Louis XV’s reign.
Buffon had issued a similar appeal a decade before, but it had not
reached the women of France. Now the fairest breasts in Paris made their
debut as organs of ma- ternity as well as bewitchments of sex.</p>
<p>Rousseau divided the educational career of his pupil into three
periods: twelve years of childhood, eight of youth, and an indeterminate
age of preparation for marriage and parentage, for economic and social
life. In the first period education is to be almost entirely physical
and moral; books and book learning, even religion, must await the
development of the mind; till he is twelve Emile will not know a word of
history, and will hardly have heard any mention of God. 44 Education of
the body must come first. So Emile is brought up in the country, as the
only place where life can be healthy and natural.</p>
<p>Men are not made to be crowded together in anthills, but scattered
over the earth to till it. The more they are massed together, the more
corrupt they become. Disease and vice are the sure results of
overcrowded cities…. Man’s breath is fatal to his fellows…. Man is
devoured by our towns. In a few generations the race dies out or becomes
degenerate; it needs renewal, and is always renewed from the country.
Send your children out to renew themselves; send them to regain in the
open field the strength lost in the foul air of our crowded cities.
45</p>
<p>Encourage the boy to love nature and the outdoors, to develop habits
of simplicity, to live on natural foods. Is there any food more
delectable than that which has been grown in one’s own garden? A
vegetarian diet is the most wholesome, and leads to the least ailments.
46</p>
<p>The indifference of children toward meat is one proof that the taste
for meat is unnatural. Their preference is for vegetable foods, milk,
pastry, fruit, etc. Beware of changing this natural taste and making
your children flesh-eaters. Do this, if not for their health, then for
the sake of their character. How can we explain away the fact that great
meat-eaters are usually fiercer and more cruel than other men ? 47</p>
<p>After proper food, good habits. Emile is to be taught to rise early.
“We saw the sun rise in midsummer, we shall see it rise at Christmas;…
we are no lie- abeds, we enjoy the cold.” 48 Emile washes often, and as
he grows stronger he reduces the warmth of the water, till “at last he
bathes winter and summer in cold, even in ice water. To avoid risk, this
change is slow, gradual, imperceptible.” 49 He rarely uses any headgear,
and he goes barefoot all the year round except when leaving his house
and garden. “Children should be accustomed to cold rather than heat;
great cold never does them any harm if they are exposed to it soon
enough.” 50 Encourage the child’s</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>1 8 1</p>
<p>natural liking for activity. “Don’t make him sit still when he wants
to run</p>
<p>Nature is the best guide, and should be followed this side of such
injury:</p>
<p>Let us lay it down as an incontrovertible rule that the first
impulses of nature are always right. There is no original sin in the
human heart…. Never pun- ish your pupil, for he does not know what it
means to do wrong. Never make him say, “Forgive me.”… Wholly unmoral in
his actions, he can do nothing morally wrong, and he deserves neither
punishment nor reproof…. First leave the germ of his character free to
show itself; do not constrain him in any- thing; so you will better see
him as he really is. 53</p>
<p>However, he will need moral education; without it he will be
dangerous and miserable. But don’t preach. If you want your pupil to
learn justice and kindness, be yourself just and kind, a nd he will
imitate you. “Example! Example! Without it you will never succeed in
teaching children any- thing.” 54 Here too you can find a natural basis.
Both goodness and wicked - ness (from the viewpoint of society) are
innate in man; education must encourage the good and discourage the bad.
Self-love is universal, but it can be modified until it sends a man into
mortal peril to preserve his family, his country, or his honor. There
are social instincts that preserve the family and the group as well as
egoistic instincts that preserve the individual. 55 Sympathy ( pitie )
may be derived from self-love (as when we love the parents who nourish
and protect us), but it can flower into many forms of social behavior
and mutual aid. Hence some kind of conscience seems universal and
innate.</p>
<p>Cast your eyes over every nation of the world, peruse every volume of
its history; amid all these strange and cruel forms of worship, in this
amazing variety of manners and customs, you will everywhere find the
same [basic] ideas of good and evil…. There is, at the bottom of our
hearts, an inborn principle of justice and virtue by which, despite our
maxims, we judge our own actions, or those of others, to be good or
evil; and it is this principle that we call conscience. 56</p>
<p>Whereupon Rousseau breaks out into an apostrophe which we shall find
almost literally echoed in Kant:</p>
<p>Conscience! Conscience! Divine instinct, immortal voice from heaven;
sure guide of a creature ignorant and finite indeed, yet intelligent and
free, infallible, judge of good and evil, making man like to God! In
thee consists the excellence of man’s nature and the morality of his
actions; apart from thee I find nothing in myself to raise me above the
beasts — nothing but the sad privilege of wander- ing from one error to
another by the help of an unbridled intellect and reason which knows no
principle. 57</p>
<p>So intellectual education must come only after the formation of moral
character. Rousseau laughs at Locke’s advice to reason with
children:</p>
<p>1 82 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Those children who have been constantly reasoned with strike me as
excep- tionally silly. Of all human faculties reason… is the last and
choicest growth —and you would use this for the child’s early training?
To make a man reason - able is the coping stone of a good education, and
yet you profess to train a child through his reason. You begin at the
wrong end. 58</p>
<p>No; we must, rather, retard mental education. “Keep the child’s mind
[in - tellect] idle as long as you can.” 59 If he has opinions before he
is twelve you may be sure they will be absurd. And don’t bother him yet
with science; this is an endless chase, in which everything that we
discover merely adds to our ignorance and our foolish pride. 60 Let your
pupil learn by experience the life and workings of nature; let him enjoy
the stars without pretending to trace their history.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve intellectual education may begin, and £mile may
read a few books. He may make a transition from nature to literature by
reading Robinson Crusoe , for that is the story of a man who, on his
island, went through the various stages through which men passed from
savagery to civilization. But by the age of twenty £mile will not have
read many books. He will quite ignore the salons and the philosophes. He
will not bother with the arts, for the only true beauty is in nature. 61
He will never be “a musician, an actor, or an author.” 62 Rather, he
will have acquired sufficient skill in some trade to earn his living
with his hands if that should ever be necessary. (Many a tradeless
emigre, thirty years later, would regret having laughed, as Vol- taire
did, at Rousseau’s “ gentilhomme menuisier ” — gentleman carpenter. 63 )
In any case £mile (though he is heir to a modest fortune) must serve
society either manually or mentally. “The man who eats in idleness what
he has not earned is a thief.” 64</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Religion</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, when £mile is about eighteen, we may talk to him about
God.</p>
<p>I am aware that many of my readers will be surprised to find me
tracing the course of my scholar through his early years without
speaking to him of reli- gion. At fifteen he will not even know that he
has a soul; at eighteen he may not yet be ready to learn about it…. If I
had to depict the most heartbreak- ing stupidity I would paint a pedant
teaching children the catechism; if I wanted to drive a child crazy I
would set him to explain what he learned in his catechism…. No doubt
there is not a moment to be lost if we must de- serve eternal salvation;
but if the repetition of certain words suffices to obtain it, I do not
see why we should not people heaven with starlings and magpies as well
as with children. 65</p>
<p>Despite this proclamation, which infuriated the Archbishop of Paris,
Rous- seau now aimed his sharpest shafts at the philosophes. Picture
Voltaire or Diderot reading this:</p>
<p>I consulted the philosophes…. I found them all alike proud,
assertive, dog- matic; professing — even in their so-called skepticism —
to know everything; prov- ing nothing, scoffing at one another. This
last trait… struck me as the only point in which they were right.
Braggarts in attack, they are weaklings in de-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>I8 3</p>
<p>fense. Weigh their arguments, they are all destructive; count their
voices, each speaks for himself alone…. There is not one of them who, if
he chanced to discover the difference between falsehood and truth, would
not prefer his own lie to the truth which another had discovered. Where
is the philosophe who would not deceive the whole world for his own
glory ? 86</p>
<p>While he continued to condemn intolerance, Rousseau, reversing Bayle,
denounced atheism as more dangerous than fanaticism. He offered to his
readers a “profession of faith” by which he hoped to turn the tide from
the atheism of d’Holbach, Helvetius, and Didero t back to belief in God,
free will, and immortality. He remembered the two abbes — Gaime and
Gatier — whom he had met in his youth; he welded them into an imaginary
vicar in Savoy; and he put into the mouth of this village cure the
feelings and argu- ments that justified (in Rousseau’s view) a return to
religion.</p>
<p>The vicaire Savoyard is pictured as the priest of a small parish in
the Italian Alps. He privately admits to some skepticism: he doubts the
divine inspira- tion of the Prophets, the miracles of the Apostles and
the saints, and the au- thenticity of the Gospels ; 67 and, like Hume,
he asks, “Who will venture to tell me how many eyewitnesses are required
to make a miracle credible ?” 68 He rejects petitional prayer; our
prayers should be hymns to the glory of God, and expressions of
submission to His will. 69 Many items in the Catholic creed seem to him
to be superstition or mythology. 70 Nevertheless he feels that he can
best serve his people by saying nothing of his doubts, and prac- ticing
kindness and charity to all (believers and unbelievers alike), and per-
forming faithfully all the ritual of the Roman Church. Virtue is
necessary to happiness; belief in God, free will, heaven, and hell is
necessary to virtue; religions, despite their crimes, have made men and
women more virtuous, at least less cruel and villainous, than they might
otherwise have been. When these religions preach doctrines that seem
unreasonable, or weary us with ceremony, we should silence our doubts
for the sake of the group.</p>
<p>Even from the standpoint of philosophy religion is essentially right.
The Vicar begins like Descartes: “I exist, and I have senses through
which I re - ceive impressions; this is the first truth that strikes me,
and I am forced to accept it.” 71 He makes short work of Berkeley: “The
cause of my sensations is outside of me, for they affect me whether I
have any reason for them or not; they are produced and destroyed
independently of me…. Thus other entities exist besides mys elf.” A
third step answers Hume and anticipates Kant: “I find that I have the
power of comparing my sensations, so I am endowed with an active force”
for dealing with experience. 72 This mind cannot be interpreted as a
form of matter; there is no sign of a material or mechanical process in
the act of thought. How an immaterial mind can act upon a material body
is beyond our understanding; but it is a fact immedi- ately perceived,
and not to be denied for the sake of some abstract reasoning.
Philosophers must learn to recognize that something may be true even if
they cannot understand it — and especially when it is of all truths the
one most immediately perceived.</p>
<p>The next step (the Vicar admits) is mere reasoning. I do not
perceive</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>God, but I reason that just as in my voluntary actions there is a
mind as the perceived cause of motion, so there is probably a cosmic
mind behind the motions of the universe. God is unknowable, but I feel
that He is there and everywhere. I see design in a thousand instances,
from the structure of my eyes to the movements of the stars; I should no
more think of attributing to chance (however often multiplied [a la
Diderot] ) the adjustment of means to ends in living organisms and the
system of the world, than I would ascribe to chance the delectable
assemblage of letters in printing the AeneidP</p>
<p>If there is an intelligent deity behind the marvels of the universe,
it is in- credible that He will allow justice to be permanently
defeated. If only to avoid the desolating belief in the victory of evil,
I must believe in a good God assuring the triumph of good. Therefore I
must believe in an afterlife, in a heaven of reward for virtue; and
though I am revolted by the idea of hell, and would rather believe that
the wicked suffer hell in their own hearts, yet I will accept even that
awful doctrine if it is necessary for controlling the evil impulses of
mankind. In that case I would implore God not to make the pains of hell
everlasting. 74 Hence the doctrine of purgatory, as a place of
abbreviable punishment for all but the most persistent and unrepentant
sin- ners, is more humane than the division of all the dead between the
forever blessed and the eternally damned. Granted that we cannot prove
the exist- ence of heaven, how cruel it is to take from the people this
hope that solaces them in their grief and sustains them in their
defeats! 75 Without belief in God and an afterlife morality is imperiled
and life is meaningless, for in an atheistic philosophy life is a
mechanical accident passing through a thousand sufferings to an
agonizing and eternal death.</p>
<p>Consequently we must accept religion as, all in all, a vital boon to
man- kind. Nor need we make much account of the different sects into
which Christianity has been torn; they are all good if they improve
conduct and nourish hope. It is ridiculous and indecent to suppose that
those who have other creeds, gods, and sacred scriptures than our own
will be “damned.” “If there were but one religion on earth, and all
beyond its pale were condemned to eternal punishment,… the God of that
religion would be the most un- just and cruel of tyrants.” 78 So £mile
will not be taught any particular form of Christianity, “but we will
give him the means to choose for himself ac - cording to the right use
of his reason.” 77 The best way is to continue in the religion that we
inherited from our parents or our community. And to Rous- seau himself
his imaginary Vicar’s counsel is: “Return to your own country, go back
to the religion of your fathers, follow it in sincerity of heart, and
never forsake it; it is very simple and very holy; in no other religion
is the morality purer, or the doctrine more satisfying to reason.”
78</p>
<p>Rousseau, in 1754, had anticipated this counsel — had returned to
Geneva and its creed; however, he had not kept his promise to come and
dwell there after settling his affairs in France. In the Letters from
the Mountain which he wrote ten years later he repudiated, as we shall
see, most of the faith of his fathers. In his final decade we shall find
him advising religion to others, but giving hardly any sign of religious
belief or practice in his daily life. Protes-</p>

<p>ants and Catholics, Calvinists and Jesuits, joined in attacking him
and his vicarious “Profession of Faith” as essentially un -Christian. 79
The education he proposed for £mile shocked Christian readers as in
effect irreligious, for they suspected that an average youth brought up
to no religion would not adopt one later except for social convenience.
Despite his formal acceptance of Calvinism Rousseau rejected the
doctrine of original sin and the redemp- tive role of the death of
Christ. He refused to accept the Old Testament as the word of God, and
thought the New Testament “full of incredible things, things repugnant
to reason ,” 80 but he loved the Gospels as the most moving and
inspiring of all books.</p>
<p>Can a book at once so grand and so simple be the work of men? Is it
possible that he whose history is contained therein is no more than a
man?… What gentleness and purity in his actions, what a touching grace
in his teachings! How lofty are his sayings, how profoundly wise are his
sermons, how just and discriminating are his replies! What man, what
sage can live, suffer, and die without weakness or ostentation?… If the
life and death of Socrates are those of a philosopher, the life and
death of Christ are those of a God. 81</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Love and Marriage</li>
</ol>
<p>When Rousseau ended the fifty pages of the Savoyard Vicar and turned
back to £mile, he faced the problems of sex and marriage.</p>
<p>Should he tell his pupil about sex? Not till he asks about it; then
tell him the truth. 82 But do everything consistent with truth and
health to retard sexual consciousness. In any case don’t stimulate
it.</p>
<p>When the critical age approaches, present to young people such
spectacles as will restrain rather than excite them sexually…. Remove
them from great cities, where the flaunted attire and boldness of the
women hasten and anticipate the promptings of nature, where everything
offers to their view pleasures of which they should know nothing till
they are of an age to choose for themselves…. If their taste for the
arts keeps them in town, guard them… from a dangerous idleness. Choose
carefully their company, their occupa- tions, and their pleasures; show
them nothing but modest and pathetic pictures,… and nourish their
sensibility without stimulating their senses. 83</p>
<p>Rousseau worried about the dire results of a practice about which he
seems to have had firsthand experience:</p>
<p>Never leave the young man night or day, and at least share his room.
Never let him go to bed till he is sleepy, and let him rise as soon as
he awakes…. If once he acquires this dangerous habit he is ruined. From
that time forward body and soul will be enervated; he will carry to the
grave the effects of… the most fatal habit which a young man can
acquire.</p>
<p>And he lays down the law to his pupil:</p>
<p>If you cannot master your passions, dear Emile, I pity you, but I
shall not hesitate for a moment; I will not permit the purposes of
nature to be evaded. If you must be a slave I prefer to surrender you to
a tyrant from whom I may deliver you; whatever happens, I can free you
more easily from slavery to women than from yourself. 84</p>
<p>1 86 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>But don’t let your associates tease you into a brothel! “Why do these
young men want to persuade you? Because they wish to seduce you…. Their
only motive is a secret spite because they see you are better than they
are; they want to drag you down to their level.”</p>
<p>It is better to marry. But whom? The tutor describes his ideal of a
girl, a woman, and a wife, and strives to imprint that ideal upon
Emile’s mind as a guide and a goal in searching for a mate. Rousseau
feared masculine, dom- ineering, immodest women; he saw the fall of
civilization in the rule of in- creasingly masculine women over
increasingly feminine men. “In every land the men are the sort that the
women make them;… restore women to womanhood, and we shall be men
again.” 85 “The women of Paris usurp the rights of one sex without
wishing to renounce those of the other; conse- quently they possess none
in their fullness.” 86 They do these things better in Protestant
countries, where modesty is not a jest among sophists but a promise of
faithful motherhood. 87 A woman’s place is in the home, as among the
ancient Greeks; she should accept her husband as a master, but in the
home she should be supreme. 88 In that way the health of the race will
be preserved.</p>
<p>The education of girls should aim to produce such women. They should
be educated at home, by their mothers; they should learn all the arts of
the home, from cooking to embroidery. They should get much religion, and
as early as possible, for this will help them to modesty, virtue, and
obedience. A daughter should accept without question the religion of her
mother, but a wife should accept the religion of her husband. 89 In any
case let her avoid philosophy and scorn to be a salonniere. 90 However,
a girl should not be suppressed into a dull timidity; “she should be
lively, merry, and eager; she should sing and dance to her heart’s
content, and enjoy all the innocent pleasures of youth”; let her go to
balls and sports, even to theaters— under proper supervision and in good
company. 91 Her mind should be kept active and alert if she is ever to
be a fit wife for a thinking man. And she “may be</p>
<p>When this ideal of girlhood and womanhood has been fixed in Emile’s
hopes he may go out and seek a mate. He, not his parents or his tutor,
shall make the choice, but he owes it to them, and to their loving care
of him through many years, to consult them respectfully. You wish to go
to the big city and look at the girls who are on display there? Very
well; we shall go to Paris; you will see for yourself what these
exciting demoiselles are. So Emile lives a while in Paris, mingles in
“society.” But he finds there no girl of the kind his sly tutor has
described. “Then farewell, Paris, far -famed Paris, with all your noise
and smoke and dirt, where the women have ceased to believe in honor and
the men in virtue. We are in search of love, happi- ness, innocence; the
farther we go from Paris, the better.” 94</p>
<p>And so tutor and pupil are back in the country; and lo, in a quiet
hamlet far from the madding crowd they come upon Sophie. Here (“Book
V”)</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) ROUSSEAU PHILOSOPHER 1 87</p>
<p>Rousseau’s treatise becomes a love story, idealized but delightful,
and told with the skill of an accomplished writer. After those long
discourses on edu- cation, politics, and religion he returns to romance,
and while Therese is busy with housework he resumes his dreams of that
gentle woman whom he has found only in scattered moments of his
wanderings; and he names her from his latest flame.</p>
<p>This new Sophie is the daughter of a once prosperous gentleman who
now lives in contented retirement and simplicity. She is healthy,
lovely, modest, tender — and useful; she helps her mother with quick and
quiet competence</p>
<p>One morning… Emile enters my room and embraces me, saying, “My
master, congratulate your son; he hopes soon to have the honor of being
a father. What a responsibility will be ours, how much we shall need
you! Yet God forbid that I should let you educate the son as well as the
father; God forbid that so sweet and holy a task should be fulfilled by
any but myself…. But continue to be the teacher of the young teachers.
Advise and control us; we shall be easily led; as long as 1 live I shall
need you…. You have done your duty; teach me to follow your example,
while you enjoy the leisure you have earned so well. 97</p>
<p>After two centuries of laudation, ridicule, and experiment, the world
is generally agreed that J Smile is beautiful, suggestive, and
impossible. Education is a dull subject, for we remember it with pain,
we do not care to hear about it, and we resent any further imposition of
it after we have served our time at school. Yet of this forbidding topic
Rousseau made a charming romance. The simple, direct, personal style
captivates us despite some flowery exalta- tions; we are drawn along and
surrender ourselves to the omniscient tutor, though we should hesitate
to surrender our sons. Having extolled maternal care and family life,
Rousseau takes £mile from his parents and brings him up in antiseptic
isolation from the society in which he must later live. Never having
brought up children, he does not know that the average child is by</p>
