<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>From Rubens to Rembrandt</p>
<p>1555-1660</p>
<p>I. THE FLEMINGS</p>
<p>I T IS surprising that in so small a segment of Europe as the
Netherlands two such diverse cultures developed as the Flemish and the
Dutch,</p>
<p>two faiths so uncongenial as Catholicism and Calvinism, two artists
so opposed in mood and method as Rubens and Rembrandt, as Vandyck and
Hals.</p>
<p>We cannot explain the contrast through language, for half of
Flanders,* like all the United Provinces, spoke Dutch. Some of the
difference may have derived from the proximity of Holland to Protestant
Germany, of Flanders to Catholic France. Part of it came from the closer
association of Catholic, royalist, aristocratic Spain with Brussels and
Antwerp.</p>
<p>Flanders inherited medieval religion, art, and ways, while Holland
was yet too poor to have a culture of its own. Possibly the greater
sunshine in the southern provinces inclined their population to a
sensual, morally easy life and an indulgent Catholicism, while the mists
and hardships of the north may have encouraged a stern and stoic faith.
Or was it, rather, that the Spanish armies won in the south and,
harassed by intervening rivers and Dutch money, lost in the north?</p>
<p>Antwerp must have been beautiful when its cathedral was complete in
all its spires, facade, and decorative art, while nearby the Bourse
throbbed witli all the vitality and chicanery of commerce, and the
waters danced with the shipping of the world. But then war came: Alva’s
fury and the Inquisition drove Protestant artisans and merchants into
FTolland, Ger- many, and England, the Calvinist Fury gutted the
churches, the Spanish Fury rifled the homes and burned the palaces, the
French Fury drowned its failure in blood, and the fourteen months’ siege
by Farnese starved Catholics and Protestants impartially. At last the
Catholics joined the Protestants in exodus, and Antwerp’s trade passed
to Amsterdam, Rotter - dam, Haarlem, Hamburg, London, and Rouen.</p>
<p>But man’s ferocity is intermittent, his resilience endures. It is a
con -</p>
<p>solation to note how quickly some nations and cities have recovered
from</p>

the Spanish Netherlands, and Holland and Dutch for all the northern, or
United, Provinces.</li>

<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>463</p>
<p>the destructiveness of war. So it was with Flanders after 1579. The
textile industry survived, Flemish lace was still in demand, the rains
still nourished the land, and the toil of the people supplied the
splendor of the court. Under the archdukes, luxury-loving but humane,
Antwerp and Brussels enjoyed a remarkable resurrection. Flanders
returned to its cathedrals, its religious festivals, its pagan kermis.
Perhaps Rubens exaggerated this in the wild Kermis of the Louvre, but
hear the report of the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand from Antwerp to Philip
IV in 1639: “Yesterday they held</p>
<p>their great festival … a long procession moved out to the countryside
with many triumphal cars. After the parade they all went to eat and
drink, and in the end they were all drunk; for without that they do not
think it a festival.”^ The Cardinal himself, when he came from Spain to
Brussels (1635), had been received with several days of pageantry, amid
gorgeous decorations designed by Rubens himself. The Flemish towns,
before the revolt, had been described by an Italian visitor as having “a
constant succession of gay assemblies, nuptials, and dances, while
music, singing, and cheerful sounds prevailed in every street”;^ and not
all of that spirit had yielded to the war. The games that Brueghel had
pictured were still played in the streets, and the churches heard again
such poly- phonic Masses as had once made Flemish singers the desired of
every court. Flanders entered its most brilliant age.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FLEMISH ART</li>
</ol>
<p>The court and the Church, the nobles and the burghers, co-operated to
finance the revival of Flemish art. Albert and Isabel supported many
artists besides Rubens; for a time Antwerp was the art center of Europe.
Brussels tapestries regained their excell ence, aided by Rubens’ heroic
de - signs. Venetian glassmakers had brought their art to the
Netherlands in 1541; now native artisans reproduced the fragile
miracles, some so cher- ished that they have survived centuries of
turbulence. Workers in metal fashioned marvels of their own, like the
magnificent reliquaries that may still be found in the Catholic churches
of Belgium. The merchant aristoc- racy ordered objects of art, sat for
pictures, and built princely palaces and town halls — such as that which
Cornelis de Vriendt raised to the glory of Antwerp (1561-65) before the
storm. When fanaticism had denuded the churches of their art, they
became eager patrons of the studios, demanding statues and pictures to
visualize the creed for the people.</p>
<p>Sculpture struck no spark here, for Frangois Duquesnoy of
Brussels</p>
<p>did most of his work in Rome, where he carved a mighty St. Andrew for
the interior of St. Peter’s. Very few tourists who make it a point to
see “the</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>oldest citizen of Brussels,” the fountain of the Manneken -Pis (1619)
— the bronze boy who adds to the city’s water out of his own resources —
know that this is the most enduring of Duquesnoy’s creations.</p>
<p>But of Flemish painters there is no count. Apparently every house in
the Netherlands had to have some original picture; a thousand artists
were kept busy in a hundred studios painting portraits, landscapes,
animals, victuals, mythologies. Holy Families, Crucifixions, and, as
their distinctive contributions to the history of art, group pictures of
municipal bodies and genre pictures of domestic or village life. At
first these painters submitted to the prestige of Italian modes. Italian
ships sailed every day into</p>
<p>Antwerp, Italian traders set up shops there, Italian artists came to
scoff and remained to paint. Many Flemish painters went to study in
Italy; some settled there; so Justus Sustermans of Antwerp became a
favorite portrait painter for the grand dukes of Tuscany; some of the
finest portraits in the Pitti Palace are by this lusty Fleming. Frans
Floris, returning from his studies with Michelangelo in Rome, called
himself frankly a “Roman - ist,” relished anatomy, and subordinated
color to fine. For a generation (1547-70) his studio at Antwerp was the
center and summit of Flemish painting. It is almost worth going to Caen
to see in its museum his jolly mountainous Wife of the Falcon Hunter,
Frans lived in wealth, built him- self a palace, gave and drank freely,
and died in poverty. Cornelis de Vos was the ablest in a large family of
painters; when too many notables begged to sit for Rubens he sent some
of them to Vos, assuring them that they would fare just as well. We can
still see Cornelis, his wife, and two pretty daughters, hanging
comfortably in the Brussels Museum.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the sixteenth century the Italian infatuation
faded, and Flemish artists resumed native themes and ways. David Teniers
the Elder, though he studied in Rome, returned to Antwerp to paint a
Dutch Kitchen and a Village Kermis,^ and then taught his son to surpass
him. The descendants of Old Droll Peasant Pieter Brueghel formed a
dynasty of painters devoted to local landscapes and village scenes; his
sons Pieter “Hell” Brueghel and Jan “Velvet” Brueghel, his grandsons Jan
II and</p>
<p>Ambrose, his great-grandson Abraham, his great-great-grandson Jan
Baptist Brueghel — they run over two centuries (1525-1719), but let us
clear the slate of them here. They took from their powerful ancestor a
flair for rural prospects and village festivities, and some of them
painted landscape backgrounds for busy Rubens.</p>
<p>The artists of the Netherlands brought art out of the church and the
monastery into the home, the fields, and the woods. Daniel Seghers
painted flowers and fruit in loving detail, devoted his pictured wreaths
to the Virgin, and joined the Jesuits. Frans Snyders gave life and
fragrance to a score of museums with exciting, sometimes gory, hunting
scenes, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>465</p>
<p>many a dish of venison and fruit; he still remains, as Rubens ranked
him, the greatest painter of animals; no one has rivaled him in catching
the play of light upon the fur of beasts or the plumage of birds.</p>
<p>Adriaen Brouwer returned to Brueghel’s peasants and pinned them on
his brush as they dined, drank, sang, danced, played cards, cast dice,
fought, caroused, and slept. Adriaen himself, in his thirty-two years,
sampled many lives: studying for a while with Hals in Haarlem; then,
aged twenty- one, already a registered master in the painters’ guild at
Antwerp; spending beyond his income, and soon entangled in debt; im-
prisoned by the Spaniards for causes now unknown, but living sumptu-
ously in jail; achieving freedom and paying his debts with little
pictures so full of life, so technically excellent in sensitive drawing
and subtle play of light, that Rubens bought seventeen of them and
Rembrandt eight. His peasants seem never happy except when stupefied
with strong tobacco or cheap drink, but Brouwer preferred a peasant
singing in his cups to a silken hypocrite flattering a prince. In 1638,
aged thirty-two, he was found dead outside a tavern door.</p>
<p>Jacob Jordaens was a soberer man, who inscribed upon one of his
pictures a warning to his thirst: Nihil similius insa.no quam ebrius —
“Nothing is liker to a lunatic than a drunkard.” He chose to picture
people who could drink without drooling and women who could rustle silk
majestically. Born in 1593, he lived to the sensible old age of
eighty-five. He pictured himself for us in The Artist and His Family:* a
man erect, self-confident, handsome, prosperous, holding a lute; a wife
at ease in her choking ruff; a pretty daughter just beginning to bloom
Flemishly; and a little girl happy in a comforting borne and creed — see
her pendant cross. Jordaens was converted to Protestantism, but only at
sixty-two. He painted several religious pictures, but he preferred genre
and rriythologies, where he could bring out the powerful heads and
effulgent breasts of the men and women he had seen in Antwerp homes, as
in The King Drinks^ or, better, in The Allegory of Fertility;^ her e,
amid fruit (painted by Jacob’s friend Snyders) and satyrs, we are
startled by a magnificent nude, seen only in rear ele- vation but in all
the grace of youth; where in Rubens’ Flanders did</p>
<p>Jordaens find so slender a model?</p>

<li>RUBENS: 1577-1640</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest of the Flemings was born in 1577 of a long line of
success- ful businessmen; he continued the line. His father, Jan Rubens,
studied law at Padua, married Maria Pypelinckx, and was elected an
alderman at Antwerp at thirty-one. Accused of Protestantism and excluded
by name</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, XVIII</p>
<p>from the amnesty of 1574, he fled with his wife and four children to
Cologne. Chosen as legal adviser by Anne of Saxony (the separated wife
of William of Orange), he committed adultery with her and was im-</p>
<p>prisoned by the Prince at Dillenburg. Maria forgave her husband,
wrote him tender and touching letters,* pleaded and labored for his
liberation, and obtained it after two trying years, on condition that
Jan live under surveillance at Siegen in Westphalia. She joined him in
1573, and it was probably there that Peter Paul was born. He was
baptized by Lutheran rites, but while he was still a child the family
was converted to Catholicism. In 1578 Jan moved with his family to
Cologne, where he practiced law and prospered. When he died (1587) Maria
and the children went to live in Antwerp.</p>
<p>Rubens received formal education only till fifteen, but he added to
it much reading and experience. For two years (1590-91) he served as
page to the Countess of Lalaing at Audenaarde; there, presumably, he
learned French and the fine manners that distinguished him from most
artists of his time. His mother, perceiving his flair for drawing,
apprenticed him to Tobias Verhaecht, then to Adam van Noort, then to
Otho Vaenius, a man of wide culture and courtly speech. After eight
years with this</p>
<p>admirable teacher, Rubens, now twenty-three, went to Italy to study
the masterpieces whose fame agitated all pictorial souls. At Venice hp
showed his own work to a gentleman in the retinue of Vincenzo Gonzaga,
Duke of Mantua; soon Rubens was living in the ducal palace of Mantua as
court painter. Two pictures that he made there already touched mastery:
Justus Lipsius and His Pupils,^ in which the pupils of the famous
scholar include Peter and his brother Philip; and a Self-Portrait,^
showing Rubens half bald at twenty-five, but bearded, bold, and alert.
He made trips to Rome to copy pictures for the Duke, and to Florence,
where he saw (and later idealistically painted) the marriage of Maria
de’ Medici to the absent Henry IV. In 1603 the Duke sent him with a
diplomatic mission to Spain, bearing gifts to the Duke of Lerma; the
minister accepted as originals the copies that Rubens had made, and the
artist returned to Mantua as a suc- cessful diplomat. On a second trip
to Rome he settled there permanently with his brother, who was librarian
to a cardinal. Pieter now painted a multitude of saints; one of these
pictures, St. Gregory Worshiping the Madonna, he rated as his first
great picture. In 1608, hearing that his</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g.: “Dear and beloved husband … A letter from you . . . gave me
joy, because I see from it that you are satisfied with my forgiveness. …
I never thought that you would have believed that there would be any
difficulty about that from me, for in truth I made none. How could 1
have the heart to be angry with you in such peril, when I would give my
life to save you? . . . How could so much hatred have succeeded so
quickly to our long affection, as to make it impossible for me to pardon
a slight trespass against myself, when I have to pray to God to forgive
the many grave trespasses I commit against Him every day?”^</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, xvm) FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>mother was ill, he rushed north to Antwerp and was deeply moved to
find her dead. Her wise and patient love had helped to give him the
cheer- ful disposition that blessed his life. Meanwhile he had learned
much in Italy. The luscious color of the Venetians, the sensualism of
Giulio</p>
<p>Romano’s frescoes at Mantua, the pliant grace of Correggio’s female
figures at Parma, the pagan art of pagan and Christian Rome, the
reconcili- ation of Christianity with the enjoyment of wine, women, and
song — all these passed into his blood and art. When Archduke Albert
made him court painter at Antwerp (1609), Gothic remnants disappeared
from Flemish painting, and the fusion of Flemish with Italian art was
complete.</p>
<p>It was part of his unconscious wisdom that he had been away from the
Netherlands during eight years of war, and that he received his appoint-
ment in the first year of the truce. It was precisely in the next twelve
years that Antwerp and Brussels restored their cultural life. Rubens was
no small part of that revival; his biographer lists 1,204 paintings and
380 drawings,^^ and probably many others escaped history. This fertility
is unparalleled in the history of art; and almost as remarkable were the
diversity of subjects and the rapidity of execution. “My talent is of
such a kind,” Rubens wrote, “that no commission, however great in size
or varied in subject matter, ever daunted me.”^^ H e finished in
twenty-five days the three panels of The Descent jrom the Cross for the
Antwerp cathedral, and in thirteen days the immense Adoration of the
Kings now in the Louvre. In addition to his court salary of five hundred
florins a year, he received payment for each individual product, and he
charged at a lordly rate; e.g., 3,800 florins (7,500?) for the two
masterpieces just named — i.e., one hundred florins (,250?) per day.^®
Part of this, of course, went to his numerous assist- ants, several of
whom were themselves registered as masters in the artists’ guild. Jan
“Velvet” Brueghel painted flowers in Rubens’ pictures, Jan Wildens
painted landscapes and accessories, Paul de Vos painted minerals and
fruit, Frans Snyders evoked the fine-pointed head of a dog in Diana
Returning from the Chase, and we do not know how much is Snyders and how
much is Rubens in the powerful hunting scenes in the Dresden and Munich
galleries and the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In some cases Rubens
drew the figures and left the painting to his aides. To his clients he
gave a conscientious account of the degree in which the pictures he sold
them were by his own hand.’® Only in this way could he meet the demands
made upon him. His studio became a factory, reflecting the business
methods of the Netherlands economy. His fertility and celerity sometimes
lowered the quality of his product, but he neared perfection often
enough to become the god of Flemish art.</p>
<p>Now he felt secure enough to marry (1609). Isabella Brant was the</p>
<p>daughter of an Antwerp lawyer and alderman, and therefore a fit
mate</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>for the son of an Antwerp lawyer and alderman. Rubens went to live in
her father’s house till his own palatial home on the Wappens Canal was
finished. In one of his finest paintings^* Peter and Isabella are
pictured in the happiness of early marriage: she hidden in overflowing
robes and laced in flowered bodice, her hand laid trustfully and
possessively upon his, her proud face rising out of an enormous blue
ruff, her head crowned with a cavalier hat; he in ripe manhood and
success, with sturdy legs, blond beard, handsome features, and ribboned
hat. Isabella was allowed only seventeen more years of life; but she
gave him children whom he raised and por- trayed lovingly; see the
curlyheaded boy in the Berlin Kaiser-Friedrich Museum, plump and happy,
playing with a dove, and see him again, sobered by full seven years, in
The Sons of the Artist}’’ Only a good man could have painted these
portraits.</p>
<p>At tlie same time he was basically a pagan, unabashedly in love with
the human body, male as well as female, in all the intoxication of
athletic strength or easeful curves. It is a symbol of his Flanders that
it enjoyed his profane mythologies — ^riots of unimpeded flesh — ^while
the churches welcomed his interpretations of religious themes. He could
not quite make up his mind between Mary and Venus; probably he felt no
contradiction between them, for both of them brought money . In The
Worship of Venus’^ the pagan element is unrestrained — a parkful of
bacchantes modestly hid- ing an elbow or a knee and embraced by goaty
satyrs, while a dozen infants dance around a statue of the goddess of
love. Though these pagan subjects echo his stay in Italy, his Venuses
lack all classic line; they cannot live in the north on sun and air and
wine, as in the south; they must eat and drink to cushion themselves
from rain and mists and cold; Teutonic flesh, hke British whiskey —
English or Scotch — ^is a climatic defense. One of Rubens’ pictures —
three bulging nudes — is entitled Without Wine and Bread Venus Is Cold}^
he was too courtly to say “without meat and</p>
<p>beer.” So he saw nothing out of scale in a Shepherd Making Lovef’’’
which shows a shepherd trying to seduce three hundred pounds; there’s
nothing good or bad, beautiful or ugly, but environment makes it so. In
The</p>
<p>Rape of the Sabines<sup>’</sup> it is all that two mighty Romans can
do to lift one of their ravishing ravished captives upon a horse. Even
in The Con- sequences of War’’^ there is no emaciation. Diana Returning

congested breast. The Three Graces f’’’ however, are relatively svelte,

<p>469</p>
<p>Judgment of Paris^^ two of the ladies conform to later fashions; one
is among the fairest female figures in art. Usually, in these pagan
pictures, there is far more than flesh; Rubens poured into them the rich
abandon of his fancy, a hundred accessories filling out the scene,
delineated with careless care, and leaping to the eye with color,
warmth, and life. Nor is there any prurience in the billowy display; it
is merely animal vitality, mens plena in corpore plena; not one of these
pictures offers erotic stimulus. Rubens himself was anomalously
well-behaved for an artist necessarily high-strung and sensitive to
color and form; he was known as a good husband, a “solid family man,”
untouched with any scandal of gal - lantry or intrigue.®*</p>
<p>The ecclesiastics of Flanders, Italy, and Spain recognized the
innocence of his sensuality, and had no qualms in asking him to
illustrate again the story of Mary, Christ, and the saints. He
accommodated them, but in his own unhackneyed way. Which of his
countless predecessors visualized with fuller imagination, or painted
with subtler skill, the ancient theme of The Adoration of the
Kings?*<sup>’</sup> Who would ha ve dared to center the composition upon
the fat belly of a bronzed and turbaned Ethiopian look- ing in colorful
disdain upon the pale faces around him? Who would have dreamed that this
pagan peering with eye and brush into every nook and cranny of the
female form would love the Jesuits, would join their Marian
Congregation, and would perform the exercises prescribed by Ignatius
Loyola to cleanse the soul with visions of hell?®^ In March 1620 he con-
tracted with the Jesuits to design, before the end of the year,
thirty-nine pictures to cover the ceilings of the splendid baroque
church that they had begun to build in Antwerp in 1614. He made the
drawings, Vandyck and others turned these into paintings, nearly all of
which were destroyed in</p>

<li>For the high altar Rubens himself painted two major works, Ignatius
Healing the Possessed and The Miracles of St. Francis, both now in the

</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, Rubens was a Catholic only in the Renaissance sense,
and a Christian only by location. His paganism survived within his
piety. He was not quite comfortable with Virgins and saints; his
Madonnas are robust women clearly fitter to manage a man than to beget a
god. In The Madonna in a Garland of Floivers^^ Mary holds up not a
divinity but a handsome boy displaying his equipment to the world; and
The Return from Egypf^ shows Christ as a curlyheaded lad, and Mary
dressed like a Flemish matron wearing her new hat on a Sunday walk in
the park. Even in The Elevation of the Cross (in the Antwerp cathedral)
Rubens’ inter - est in anatomy dominates the religious motif: Christ is
a virile athlete, not a dying god. In The Blow of the Lance^* everything
again is anatomy:</p>
<p>• This picture brought 70,000 at an auction in London in 1959.</p>
<p>47° the age of reason begins (chap, xvhi</p>
<p>Christ and the thieves are massive figures, every straining muscle
shown; the women at the foot of the Cross are posing for the artist
rather than fainting with grief; Rubens has not felt the scene.</p>
<p>At least five times Rubens challenged Titian with an Assumption
of</p>
<p>the Virgm; in the most famous of these efforts*® the Madonna seems
life- less, and the living creatures are the Magdalen and the startled
Apostles at the empty tomb. Finer is the great triptych** commissioned
by the Arch- duchess Isabel for the Confraternity of St. Ildefonso in
Brussels. In the central panel the Virgin, descended from heaven,
presents to the Arch- bishop of Toledo a chasuble direct from Paradise;
the saint is all humility, “breathless with adoration”; while in the
side panels Isabel and Albert lay aside their crowns and kneel in
prayer; here for a time Rubens gave life to piety. And in St. Ambrose
and the Emperor Theodosiu^’’ he caught and conveyed the mysterious power
and authority of the Church: the Archbishop of Milan, armed only with
priests and an acolyte, but with a head of majesty, drives from the
cathedral the Emperor backed with awesome guards but burdened with
unshriven cruelty. Rubens rarely failed with old men, for in them,
especially, the face is an autobiography, and offers visible character
to perceiving art. See the patriarch’s head in Lot and His Family
Leaving SodonF^ — one of the finest Rubens pictures in America.</p>
<p>He returned with gusto to secular subjects, mixed with mythology,</p>
<p>when Marie de Medicis offered him the most tempting contract of his
career. On February i6, 1622, he signed an agreement to paint, within
four years, twenty-one large pictures and three portraits commemorating
events in the life of Marie and her husband, Henry IV. The Queen in-
vited him to come and live at the French court; he had the good sense to
stay home. In May 1623 he took the first nine panels to Paris. Marie
liked them, Richelieu admired them. The series was completed in 1624;
Rubens took the remainder to Paris and saw them set up in the Luxembourg
Palace. In 1802 the pictures were transferred to the Louvre, where
nineteen of them now enjoy a room all their own. Those who have seen and
studied them will not grudge the twenty thousand crowns (50,000?) paid
to Rubens for his work, and doubtless shared by him with his aides. All
in all, these paintings are his supreme achievement. If we allow for
some marks of haste, and accept the incredible story as we do in Ovid,
Shake- speare, and Verdi, we shall find all of Rubens here except his
occasional piety. He loved the splendor of court ritual, the majesty of
royal power; he never tired of plump women, rich raiment, and gorgeous
drapery; he had lived half his days with the gods and goddesses of
classical mythology; now he brought all these together in a flowing
narrative, with an inventive- ness of episode, an opulence of color, a
mastery of composition and design, that made the series an epic and
opera in the history of painting.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT 471</p>
<p>Only two more honors were wanting to Rubens’ apotheosis — to be made
a diplomat and to receive a patent of nobility. In 1623 the Archduchess
Isabel used him as negotiator in hopes to renew the truce with Holland;
Rubens had his own reason for promoting peace, since his wife aspired to
inherit a fortune from her Dutch uncle.*® These efforts failed;
nevertheless Isabel persuaded Philip IV to ennoble him (1624), and made
him “Gentle - man of the Household of Her Most Serene Highness” — i.e.,
herself. Later the King protested against her employing “so mean
〔unpedi greed〕 a per- son” to receive foreign envoys and discuss
“affairs of such great impor - tance”;^® yet Isabel sent Rubens to
Madrid a year later (1628) to help arrange a peace between Philip IV and
Charles I. He took some of his paintings with him; the King revised his
notion of pedigree and sat to Rubens for five portraits, as if VeMzquez
were not making enough. The two artists became good friends, the
Spaniard, then twenty-nine, modestly deferring to the genial Fleming,
then fifty-one. Finally Philip appointed the “mean” Rubens as his envoy
to England. In London the artist success - fully concluded a treaty of
peace, despite the emissaries and the bribes of Richelieu to the
contrary. Rubens painted some English portraits — the Duke and Duchess
of Buckingham, and the magnificent face, beard, and armor of Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel.** Having paved the way for Vandyck, he returned
to Antwerp (March 1630) with a degree from Cam- bridge and a knighthood
from Charles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his first wife had died (1626), and, as Flemish custom re-
quired, the funeral was celebrated with a lavish banquet that cost the
artist- diplomat 204 florins (,800?) “on food and drink and hired
plate”;*® death in Flemish society was an almost prohibitive luxury.
Rubens drowned his loneliness in diplomacy. In 1630, aged fifty-three,
he married Helena Fourment, aged sixteen. He needed beauty about him,
and she had already the warm coziness that filled his art and his
dreams. He painted her again and again, in every garb and none; in her
wedding costume,** holding a glove,<em>® happy under a saucy hat,</em>®
hiding only her hips in a fur coat,<em>’^ and, best of all, walking with
Rubens in their garden</em>® — this last is one of the peaks of Flemish
painting. Then he showed her with their first-bom,*® and later with
their two children®® — a presage of Renoir; not to speak of the pictures
in which she posed voluptuously as V enus or demurely as the Mother of
God.</p>
<p>Fle painted his beloved rulers, Albert and Isabel, without flattery;
we see them in the Vienna and Pitti galleries probably as they were —
governing a troubled land with all the good will compatible with Spanish
ideals. He found fine types of manhood and womanhood in Flanders; he
pictured them in his painting of Jean Charles de Cordes and his pretty
pouting wife,®* and in the portrait of Michael Ophovius,®* Bishop of ’s
Hertogenbosch; and he left us a powerful image of the invincible
Spinola.®® But portraiture was</p>
<p>472</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xvni</p>
<p>not Rubens’ forte; he gives us no subtle insights like Titian, no
revelations from the depths as in Rembrandt. The greatest of his
portraits is that which he painted of himself in 1624 for the future
Charles immense gold-tasseled hat, revealing only the great forehead of
the bald head; penetrating eyes in quizzical glance; the long sharp nose
that seems to go with genius; the bristling mustache and fine red beard;
this is a man well aware that he is at the top of his craft. Yet
something of the physical vitality, sensuous enjoyment, and calm content
that had shone in the picture of himself with Isabella Brant has gone
with the years. Only</p>
<p>failure wears out a man faster than success.</p>
<p>He was rich, and he lived in grand style; his costly home in
Antwerp</p>
<p>was one of the sights of the city. In 1635 he bought for 93,000
florins an extensive estate and feudal castle in the lordship of Steen,
eighteen miles out, and took the title Lord of Steen. He spent his
summers there, painted landscapes, and tried his polyphonic hand at
genre. Amid his luxuries, with three maidservants, two grooms, and three
horses, he continued to work hard, finding his happiness in his family
and his work. His wives, children, patrons, aides loved him for his
serenity of spirit, his generosity, his warm- hearted sympathy.®®</p>
<p>Others more competent must analyze the technical qualities of his
art, but we may safely describe him as the chief exemplar of pictorial
baroque — sensuous color, incalculable movement, rich imagination,
luscious orna- ment, as against classic placidity and restraint of
thought and line. But amid this confusion of beauty, the critics tell
us, there is superb draftsman- ship. Rubens’ drawings fed a brilliant
school of engravers, who made the master’s paintings known to Christian
Europe as Raimondi had done with Raphael’s designs. From Rubens’ hand or
studio came famous cartoons for the tapestry weavers of Paris and
Brussels; they made royal gifts or decoration for Louis XIII, Charles I,
and the Archduchess Isabel.</p>
<p>His final decade was one of universal triumph darkened by physical
de- cline. Only Bernini equaled him in artistic fame; in painting no one
dreamed of questioning his supremacy. Pupils ran to him from all
quarters; com- missions came from half a dozen courts, even from
Stadholder Frederick Henry across the lines of war. In 1636 Philip IV
asked him to paint scenes from Ovid’s Metamorphoses for the Pardo
hunting lodge; Rubens’ studio produced fifty pictures for the series, of
which thirty-one are in the Prado; one of them. The Judgment of Paris,
seemed to the Cardinal Infante Ferdi- nand “the best picture Rubens ever
painted.”®® We may prefer the riotous Kermis^’’ that he painted in 1636
— a Brueghel of mad pursuit, in which no woman is so old or ample but
some man snatches her.</p>
<p>The self-portrait at sixty®* is the other side of these concluding
years: a man still proud, hand on his sword of nobility, but face
thinning, skin</p>

<p>hanging, crow’s -feet under the eyes — a brave and honest picture. In
1635 gout put him to bed for a month; in 1637 it disabled his hand for a
time; in 1639 it prevented him from signing his name; by 1640 both hands
were paralyzed. On May 30, 1640, aged sixty-three, he died from
arthritis and arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p>It was an astonishing career. He was not the uomo universale of the
Renaissance ideal; yet he realized his ambition to play a role in the
state as well as the studio. He was not a universal artist, like
Leonardo and Michelangelo; he left no sculpture, designed no building
except his home. But in painting he reached high excellence in every
field. Religious pictures, pagan revels, gods and goddesses, nudity and
raiment, kings and queens, children and old men, landscapes and battle
scenes all poured from his brush as from a kaleidoscopic cornucopia of
color and form. Rubens ended the subjection of Flemish to Italian
painting, not by rebellion, but by ab- sorption and union.</p>
<p>He was not as deep as Rembrandt, but wider; he shied away from the
dark depths that Rembrandt revealed; he preferred the sun, the open air,
the dance of light, the color and zest of life; he repaid his own good
fortune by smiling upon the world. His art is the voice of health, as
ours today sometimes suggests sickness in the individual or national
soul. When our own vitality lags, let us open our Rubens book anywhere
and be refreshed.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>vandyck: 1599-1641</li>
</ol>
<p>It was just like Rubens to hail and encourage the precocious talent
of the young Adonis who joined his studio about 1617. Anthony Vandyck
(or Vandyke) had been apprenticed, at the age of eight, to Hendrik van
Balen, the teacher of Snyders; at sixteen he had pupils of his own; at
nineteen he was a registered master, not so much a pupil of Rubens as a
highly valued aide. Rubens rated an early painting by Vandyck as equal
in worth to his own Daniel of the same year; he kept for his own
collection Vandyck’s Christ Crowned with Thorns and only later,
reluctantly, surrendered it to Philip IV for the Escorial.®® In
religious pictures Vandyck came too</p>
<p>amiably under Rubens’ influence and, lacking the older artist’s
vitality of movement and color, fell short of him in all but
portraiture. In the early Self-Portrait of 1615 (i<em>)®® he revealed
the qualities that were to mark and limit his genius — grace, finesse,
and a soft beauty almost unbecoming in a man. His fellow artists were
happy to sit for him as an added hedge against oblivion; he made
admirable portraits of Snyders,</em>^ Duquesnoy,<em>® Jan Wildens,</em>®
Jan de Wael,®^ Caspar de Grayer,®® and Marten Pepijn;®® it was one of
the many lovable qualities of Vandyck that he liked his</p>
<p>474 r the age of reason begins (chap, xviii</p>
<p>rivals. Thele portraits suggest in Rubens’ studio a pleasant spirit
of com - radeship not always present in the realm of art.</p>
<p>In 1620 the Earl of Arundel received from Antwerp a letter: “Vandyck
lives with Rubens, and his works are being esteemed almost as highly as
those of his master.”®^ He invited the young artist to England. Vandyck
went, received a piddling pension of 100 from James I, painted a few
por- traits, rebelled at the menial copying required of him by the King,
asked for an eight months’ leave of absence, received it, and stretched
it to twelve years. At Antwerp he made provision for his mistress and
her baby; then he hurried down into Italy (1621).</p>
<p>There for the first time he struck his stride, and he left fine
portraits at almost every stop. He pored over the great Venetians, not
so much to study their color and massive scope, as Rubens had done, but
to ferret out the secrets of poetic portraiture in Giorgione, Titian,
and Veronese. He went on to Bologna, Florence, Rome, even to Sicily. At
Rome he stayed with Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio and repaid him with a
portrait.®® His courtly manners were resented by the Flemish artists who
were starving in Italy; they dubbed him “il pittore cavalleresco” and
made things so unpleasant that he gladly accompanied Lady Arundel to
Turin. He was especially welcomed in Genoa, which remembered Rubens and
had heard of Van- dyck’s flair for ennobling nobility, making every
sitter seem a prince. The Aletropolitan Museum of Art in New York has a
sample of these Genoese aristocrats in The Marchesa Durazzo — sensitive
face and (as always in Vandyck) fine hands; the National Gallery in
Washington has The</p>
<p>Marchesa Balbi, and The Marchesa Grimaldi — proud and pregnant;
Berlin and London have other examples; and Genoa managed to keep, in her
Palazzo Rosso, The Marchese and Marchesa di Brignole-Sale. When Van-
dyck returned to Antwerp (1628) his pockets were full and his lace was
exquisite.</p>
<p>His native city called him back from nobles to saints. To fit himself
for these he repented of his promiscuity, willed his young fortune to
two nun sisters, joined the Jesuit Confraternity of the Unmarried, and
turned his hand to religious themes. He could not rival Rubens in this
field, but he avoided the exuberant master’s exaggerations and carnal
effulgence, and gave to his pictures a touch of the elegance he had
learned in Italy. Reyn- olds thought Vandyck’s Crucifixion, in the
Mechlin cathedral, one of</p>
<p>the world’s greatest paintings; however, that may have been Sir
Joshua’s way of repaying a debt.</p>
<p>Vandyck tried his hand at mythological pictures, but though he
had</p>
<p>pursued many women he was not at home with nudes. His forte was al-
ways portraiture, and during these four years in Antwerp he gave some
respite from oblivion to Baron Philippe Le Roy and a devoted dog;®*

<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>General Francisco de Moncada and his horse;‘^® to Count
Rhodokanakis/^ looking like Swinburne; to Jean de Montfort,’® looking
like Falstaff; and — most beautiful of these Vienna Vandycks, young
Rupert, Prince Charming Palatine, soon to be fighting for Charles I in
England. Alluring, too, is the portrait of Maria Luisa of Tassis,’® lost
in her swelling robes of black satin and white silk. And as good as any
of these is Vandyc k’s etching of Pieter “Hell” Brueghel (the Younger),
an old man still seething with the un - spent sap of an amazing
dynasty.</p>
<p>Some of these portraits he took with him when Charles I invited him
to try England again. Charles, unlike his father, had a sure taste in
art. He surmised that this handsome Fleming was just the man to do for
him what Velazquez was doing for Philip IV. Vandyck came and transmitted
the King, Queen Henrietta Maria, and their children to posterity,
indelibly marked with the Vandyck elegance. Most famous of the five
royal portraits is the one in the Louvre — the proud incompetent King
posing in riding costume, one arm akimbo, sword prominent, jaunty hat,
and Vandyke beard; but the tired horse, champing the bit between hunts,
can be more easily loved. In Dresden and Turin are rival paintings of
Charles’s children, as yet harmless and innocent. Charles was more human
than he pretended; his capacity for warm affection showed in his
fondness for Vandyck; he knighted him, gave him expensive homes in
London and the country, a yearly pension of Ji’i-oo, additional payment
for each picture, and every welcome at the court.</p>
<p>The happy artist lived up to his income, loved fine clothing, had
his</p>
<p>coach-and-four, his thoroughbreds and his mistresses, and filled his
homes with music and art. He bettered Rubens’ instruction in delegating
work — left the painting of costumes to assistants, painted a portrait
in an hour from a sketch made at one sitting, and made hay while the sun
played hide-and-seek. Once (story says) Charles I, suffering from
parliamentary parsimony, asked the extravagant artist if he knew what it
meant to be short of funds. “Yes, Sire,” answered Vandyck. “When one
keeps an open table for his friends and an open purse for his
mistresses, he soon reaches the bottom of his money chest.”^^</p>
<p>If at times he sank into debt, it was not for lack of patronage. Half
the English aristocracy waited in turn to receive his imprimatur: James
Stuart, Duke of Lennox,’® as handsome as his dog; Robert Rich, Earl of
War - wick;’® Lord Derby and his family;” Thomas Wentworth, Earl of
Straf - ford,’® challenging fate. Poets too had their hour — Carew,
Killigrew, Suckling. And finally there was Old Parr,’® claiming to be
150 years old and looking it. Vandyck painted three hundred portraits in
England, al- most all distinguished by the grace and dignity that he saw
in a lord even when they were not there.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>His mistress, Margaret Lemon, competed expensively with the aristoc-
racy for his services. The King suggested that marriage would be
cheaper, and he helped Vandyck to secure (1639) the hand of Lady Mary
Ruthven, of a family famous in Scottish history. The artist painted a
handsome pic- ture of his bride,®® but it could not compare with the
lovely face he gave himself in the Self-Portraif^ that all the world
knows — ^rich wavy hair, sharp eyes, refined features, scissored beard,
gold chain proclaiming his knighthood. Did Vandyck flatter Sir Anthony?
If so, it was of no use, for his health, consumed too lavishly, had
already begun to fail. Loath to be remembered only for portraits, he
asked Charles to let him paint historic scenes on the walls of the
banqueting hall at Whitehall, but Charles was living from an empty
purse. Vandyck crossed to Paris (1640), hoping for the commission to
paint the Grande Galerie of the Louvre; Louis XIII had already chosen
Poussin, and when Poussin relinquished the assignment it was too late
for Vandyck. He fell ill, rushed back to London to his lying-in wife. He
died (1641) eleven days after she gave birth to a daughter. He was not
yet forty-two.</p>
<p>He founded no school and left no mark upon Continental art, but in
England his influence was overwhelming. Local painters like William
Dobson, Robert Walker, and Samuel Cooper made haste to copy his flat-
tering, lucrative style; and when a great burst of portraiture came with
Reynolds and Gainsborough, it was the Vandyck legacy that provided
schooling and stimulus. Vandyck’s portraits were not profound; he was
too hurried to search for the soul, and sometimes he stopped at the face
or the beard. The Cavahers who surrounded Charles I were known for their
fine manners, but it is unlikely that so many of them looked like poets;
and some of the romance that we find in their brave stand for their King
may have come to u s from seeing them through Vandyck’s eyes. It would
be unfair to expect from so frail and fortunate a youth the robust
vitality of Rubens or the de profundis clamavi of Rembrandt; but we
shall continue to cherish these Genoese, Flemish and English portraits
as bright and “precious minims” in our inheritance.</p>

<li>THE DUTCH ECONOMY</li>
</ol>
<p>What a leap it is from those perfumed Enghsh lords to the stout,
tough burghers of Haarlem, The Hague, and Amsterdam! It is a unique
world behind the dykes, a world of water rather than land, a life of
ships and commercial ventures rather’ than of courts and chivalry. There
is hardly anything more startling in economic history than the rise of
the Dutch to world power, or more comforting in cultural history than
the way in which this wealth so soon graduated into art.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT 477</p>
<p>The United Provinces had some three million population in 1600. Only
half of it tilled the land; by 1623 half of it lived in cities, and much
of the land was owned by urban landlords who trusted that commercial
profits could be deodorized by putting them into the soil. Even in
agriculture Dutch energy and skill had taken the lead in Europe; new
dykes and dams were ever recla iming “polders” from the sea; canals
fertilized farms and trade; intensive horticulture complemented
extensive stockbreeding; and Dutch engineers in the late sixteenth
century brought the windmill to per- fection just as Dutch painters were
bringing it into art. Half of industry was still handicraft, but in
mining and treating metals, weaving cloth, refining sugar, brewing beer
it was advancing to a larger, less happy, more remuner- ative scale.
Every year 1,500 “doggers” — ^two-masted fishing vessels — sailed from
Dutch ports to snare herring. Shipbuilding was a major in- dustry.
During the truce with Spain ( 1 609-2 1 ) the Netherlands sent out
16,000 vessels, averaging fifty-seven tons, with crews totaling 160,000
men — more than England, Spain, and France combined.®®</p>
<p>Anxious for trade outlets and raw materials, Dutch captains explored
uncharted seas. In 1584 Dutch merchants established themselves at Arch-
angel, and advanced against the Arctic ice in a vain effort to find a
“North - east Passage” to China and thereby win a prize of 25,000
florins offered by the government of Holland. Dutch names on modern maps
of the Spits- bergen Archipelago recall the voyages in which Willem
Barents lost his life during a winter on the ice of Novaya Zemlya
(1697). In 1593 the ad- venturous Dutch sailed into the rivers of the
Guinea Gold Coast of Africa, made friends with the natives, and
inaugurated a busy trade.</p>
<p>Till 1581 Dutch merchants had bought Oriental products on the docks
of Lisbon to resell them in northern Europe. But in that year Philip II,
having conquered Portugal, forbade trade with the Dutch, who thereupon
decided to make their own voyages to India and the Far East. Jewish
refugees from Spain and Portugal, or their descendants, were well
informed about Portuguese trading posts in the East, and the Dutch
profited from this knowledge.®® In 1 590 Dutch merchantmen, even during
the war with Spain, passed through the Straits of Gibraltar; soon they
were trading with Italy, then with the Arabs, sturdily ignoring
religious differences. They made their way to Constantinople, signed a
treaty with the Sultan, sold goods to both the Turks and their enemies
the Persians, and moved on to India. In 1595 Cornelis de Houtman led a
Dutch expedition around the Cape of Good Hope and via Madagascar to the
East Indies; by 1602 sixty- five Dutch ships had made the return voyage
to India. In 1601 the Dutch East India Company was organized, with a
capital of 6,600,000 florins — forty-four times more than the English
East India Company, formed three months before.®* In 1610 Dutch
merchants opened trade with Japan, in 1613 with Siam; in 1615 they
secured control of the Moluccas, in 1623 of</p>
<p>478 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>Formosa. In one generation they conquered an empire of islands, and
they ruled it from their Java capital, Jakarta, which they named
Batavia. In that generation the company returned an average of 2 2 per
cent annually to its shareholders. Pepper was imp orted from the “Spice”
Islands and sold in Europe for ten times the price paid to the native
producers.*®</p>
<p>Taking the planet for their province, the Dutch sent ships to seek
a</p>
<p>Northwest Passage to China. In 1609 they hired an Epglish captain,
Henry Hudson, to explore the Hudson River. Twelve years later they
organized the Dutch West India Company. In 1623 they established the
colony of New Netherland, comprising the present states of Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. In 1 626 they bought
“New Am - sterdam” (Manhattan) from the Indians for trinkets valued at
twenty -four dollars. They were rapidly clearing and developing these
lands when their North American possessions fell as a prize of war into
English hands (1664). Similar Dutch acquisitions in South America were
surrendered to the Spanish and the Portuguese; only Surinam remained, as
Dutch Guiana.</p>
<p>Despite these losses, the Dutch Empire shared abundantly with Dutch
trade in Europe to give the merchants of Holland a financial base for
their political power, their splendid homes, and their patronage of art.
During the first half of the seventeenth century the United Provinces
held the com- mercial leadership of Europe, and their wealth per capita
was greater than that of any other country in the world. Raleigh was
dismayed by the su- periority of the Dutch to the English in living
standards and business enter- prise.®* A Venetian ambassador (1618)
thought that every Hollander was in comfortable circumstances, but he
had probably little acquaintance with the lower classes, whose poverty
Rembrandt knew so well. “Mil - lionaires” were numerous in Holland; some
of them made fortunes by selling shoddy materials to the Dutch army and
navy defending Holland;®’^ and such men labored zealously to prevent the
outbreak of peace.®®</p>
<p>Most Dutch wealth was in the province of Holland, whose commerce,
from the neighboring sea, was many times greater than that of the other
northern provinces. Several towns in Holland had a prosperous
bourgeoisie — Rotterdam, The Hague, Haarlem, Utrecht — but none could
rival</p>
<p>Amsterdam. The growth of its population tells the tale: 75,000 in
1590, 300,000 in 1620. Merchants, craftsmen, and bankers had flocked to
it from war-ravaged Antwerp. After 1576 the Jews of Antwerp transferred
to Amsterdam their financial activities, their commerce, their jewel
industry — the diamond cutters of Amsterdam still lead the world. The
merchant rulers of the city allowed considerable religious freedom, for
only in this way could trade be encouraged with peoples of diverse
faiths. The Bank of Amsterdam, founded in 1609, was in this age the
strongest financial in- stitution in Europe. Dutch currency was sought
and trusted everywhere.</p>

<p>The Dutch were charged by their rivals with undue commercialism, a
fever of money-making, and the coarseness of manners sometimes con-
nected with absorption in economic life. Dutch historians amiably admit
these allegations.*® And yet can we call a culture commercial that so
loved cleanliness, tulips, music, and art, that set up a school in every
village and wiped out illiteracy, that created an intellectual
atmosphere electric with controversy and ideas, and allowed such freedom
of thought, speech, and press as soon made Holland the international
refuge of rebel minds? “There is no country,” said Descartes, “in which
freedom is more complete, se - curity greater, crime rarer, the
simplicity of ancient manners more per- fect than here.”®® And in 1660
another Frenchman wrote:</p>
<p>There is not today a province in the world that enjoys so much</p>
<p>liberty as Holland. . . . The moment a seigneur brings into this
coun- try any serfs or slaves they are free. Everybody can leave the
country when he pleases, and can take all the money he pleases with
him.</p>
<p>The roads are safe day and night, even for a man traveling alone.</p>
<p>The master is not allowed to retain a domestic against his will.
No-</p>
<p>body is troubled on account of his religion. One is free to say
what</p>
<p>he chooses, even of the magistrates.®^</p>
<p>The basis of this freedom was order, and the clarity of the mind was
mirrored in the neatness of the home. Courage, industry, and obstinacy
characterized the men; domestic assiduity and mastery marked the women;
calm temper and a bluff good humor were in both sexes. Many Dutch
businessmen retired after making a reasonable fortune, and gave
themselves to politics, literature, golf,* music, and domestic felicity.
The Dutch “hold adultery in horror,” wrote Lodovico Guicciardini. “Their
women are ex - tremely circumspect, and are consequently allowed much
freedom. They go out alone to make visits, and even journeys, without
evil report. . . . Th ey are housekeepers, and love their homes.”®*
There were many women of fine culture, like Maria Schuurman, “the
Minerva of Holland,” who read eleven languages, spoke and wrote seven,
practiced painting and sculpture well, and was adept in mathematics and
philosophy. Maria Tes- selschade’s poetry was almost as beautiful as her
person; she translated</p>

fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Bredero, laid proposals at her feet; she married a sea captain,
became a de- voted housewife and mother, and left behind her a
tradition, still dear to Dutch memory, of intelligence, accomplishments,
and nobility.®^</p>
<p>The love of music was even more widely spread than the appreciation
of art. Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck of Amsterdam, the greatest of Dutch
organists, taught Heinrich Scheidemann, who taught Johann Adam</p>
<p>Reinken, who taught Johann Sebastian Bach, Along with all this excel-
lence went some corruption in Dutch commerce, much drunkenness, many
brothels, and a taste for gambling in all its forms,®® even to
speculation in the future prices of tulips.®*</p>
<p>Haarlem was the center of the tulip culture. The bulbs had been im-
ported from Italy and South Germany toward the end of the fifteenth cen-
tury. Paris too made the flower a fashion and distinction; in 1623 one
fancier refused 12,000 francs (0,000?) for ten tulip bulbs.®’^ In 1636
nearly the entire population of Holland took to speculating in tulips;
special bourses existed where one could buy or sell tuhp crops or
futures; tulips had their own financial “crash” (1637). In that year an
auction of 120 precious bulbs for the benefit of an orphanage brought
90,000 florins; credat qui vult.</p>
<p>Into this genial atmosphere the refugees from Flanders, France,
Portugal, and Spain, and foreign merchants from half the world, imported
a stimu- lating variety of exotic ways. The universities of Leiden,
Franeker, Harder- wijk, Utrecht, and Groningen gathered world-famous
scholars, and pro- duced others in turn. Justus Lipsius, Joseph
Scaliger, Daniel Heinsius, and Gerard Vossius were all professing at
Leiden in the first half century (1575-1625) of its career; by 1640
Leiden was the most renowned seat of learning in Europe. Among the
general public of the United Provinces literacy was probably higher than
anywhere else in the world. The Dutch press was the first free press.
The Leiden weekly News and the Amsterdam Gazette were read throughout
Western Europe because they were known to speak freely, while elsewhere
the press was at this time govemmentally controlled. When a king of
France asked to have a Dutch publisher sup- pressed he was astonished to
learn that this was impossible.®*</p>
<p>Men of letters were many in Holland, but it was their misfortune that
they wrote either in Latin, which was dying, or in Dutch, which narrowed
their audience; the Dutch could not make their language, like their
marine, a common carrier. Dirck Coomhert and Hendrik Spiegel upheld the
lusty vernacular as a literary vehicle, and struggled to free it from
uncongenial accretions. Coornhert — artist, writer, statesman, and
philosopher — ^was the first and most virile figure in the cultural
blossoming that crowned the political revolt. He drew up, as city
secretary at Haarlem, the manifesto of 1566 for William of Orange, was
imprisoned at The Hague, escaped to</p>
<p>CHAP, xvni)</p>
<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>Cleves, earned his Kving as a skilled engraver, translated The
Odyssey, Boccaccio, Cicero, and the New Testament. Back in Holland, he
labored for religious toleration, and symbolized the intellectual
history of the next — ^seventeenth — century by losing the faith that he
saw so mangled in bloody disputes. He became an agnostic, confessing
that man will never know the truth.*® His principal book, Zedenkunst
{The Art of Wellh</p>
<p>Living), proposed a Christianity without theology, a system of
morality independent of religious creeds. By some oversight he was
allowed to die a natural death (1590).</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Holland that businessmen often mingled
litera- ture with their material affairs. Roemer Visscher, wealthy
merchant of Amsterdam, gave help and hospitality to young writers, made
his home a salon rivaling those of France, and himself wrote poetry that
won him the title of the Dutch Martial. Pieter Hooft made his Castle of
Muiden, on the Zuider Zee, a haven for the Dutch Renaissance; into his
Muiderkring, or Muiden Circle, he welcomed poets, scientists, diplomats,
generals, and physicians; and he himself, in his last twenty years,
wrote the Neder- landsche Historien, telling the story of the
Netherlands revolt in prose so strong and beautiful that Holland
celebrated him as its Tacitus.</p>
<p>Three among a hundred poets brought the vernacular to its literary
peak. Jacob Cats, for twenty-two years grand pensionary of Holland,
expounded proverbial wisdom in popular verse, salted with spicy
anecdotes; for cen- turies the works of “Father Cats” were in every
literate Dutch home. Joost van den Vondel climbed over misfortunes and
enemies to the supreme place in the literature of Holland. His father, a
hatter, was banished from Ant- werp for Anabaptist opinions, and Joost
was born in Cologne. In 1597 the family settled in Amsterdam, where the
father, going from one ex- treme to the other, opened a hosiery shop.
Joost inherited the business, but left its operation to his wife and son
while he made up for lack of formal education by studying Latin, Greek,
Italian, French, and German. His twenty-eight plays were formed on Greek
and French models, carefully obeying the unities. His satires ridiculed
predestination and the debates among the Protestant sects. He felt the
aesthetic appeal of Roman Catholic ritual, and of Maria Tesselschade,
who was both Catholic and beautiful. After her husband died (1634) and
Vondel’s wife died (1635), the two poets entered into close friendship.
In 1640 he was received into the Cath- olic faith. He continued to flay
religious animosity, economic chicanery, and political corruption, and
won a warm place in Dutch hearts by singing the courage and glory of the
Netherlands. In 1657 the hosiery business, which his son had mismanaged,
went bankrupt. The son fled to the East Indies, the poet sold all his
modest possessions to satisfy the creditors, and for ten years he earned
his bread as a pawnbroker’s clerk. At last his gov -</p>
<p>482 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>eminent pensioned him, and he spent the last thirteen of his
ninety-two years in peace.</p>
<p>The most attractive figure in the literature of the Netherlands in
this age was Constantijn Huygens, a Dutchman with all the versatility of
the Italian Renaissance. His father, Christian Huygens, was secretary
to</p>
<p>the Council of State at The Hague; his son, Christian Huygens, was to
be the greatest of Continental scientists in the age of Newton; between
them Constantijn well maintained the family’s remarkable progression of
ability. He was born at The Hague in 1596. There and at Leiden, Oxford,
and Cambridge he received an ample education. He wrote Latin and Dutch
poetry, excelled in athletics, and became a good musician and artist. At
twenty-two he joined a diplomatic mission to England, played the lute
before James I, and fell in love with John Donne, whose poems he later
translated into Dutch. At twenty-three he was sent on a diplomatic mis-
sion to Venice; on his return he nearly lost his life scaling the
topmost spire of the Strasbourg cathedral. In 1625 he became secretary
to a succes- sion of stadholders; in 1630 he was appointed to the Privy
Council. Mean- while he issued several volumes of poetry, distinguished
by grace of style and delicacy of feeling. His death at the age of
ninety (1687) marked the close of the Netherlands’ most brilliant
age.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>DUTCH ARTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dutch Protestants felt that medieval church architecture and</p>
<p>decoration had been forms of indoctrination perpetuating legends and
dis- couraging thought; they decided to worship God with prayer and</p>
<p>sermons rather than with art; the only art they kept in their riwal
was song. So their ecclesiastical architecture aimed at an almost stark
sim- plicity. Even the Catholics raised no memorable churches in the
United Provinces. Overseas merchants, in the sixteenth century, brought
in, per- haps from Syria or Egypt, the idea of bulbous cupolas; the
fashion spread from Holland and Russia into Germany, and became a
feature of Central European baroque.</p>
<p>Businessmen, not the clergy, dominated Dutch architecture. And first
of all they built themselves sturdy dwellings — almost all alike, not
in- stilling fear, like the Florentine palace, nor arousing envy; the
luxury and art were all inside, and in the flower gardens carefully
tended. Their civic buildings allowed more ornament and pride. Lieven de
Key brought French, German, and Renaissance elements into a remarkable
harmony in the Rathaus, or town hall, that he built for Leiden. The
Flail of the</p>
<p>Butchers’ Guild at Haarlem, also by Lieven de Key, is as proud as a
Gothic</p>
<p>CHAP, xvm) FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT 483</p>
<p>cathedral. The town hall at The Hague shows the classic style
completely domesticated in Holland.</p>
<p>The Michelangelo of Dutch architecture and sculpture in this age was
Hendrik de Keyser, who became city architect of Amsterdam at the age of
twenty-nine (1594). There he designed the Westerkerk, the Exchange, and
the East India House, all in Italian-Dutch Renaissance style. At Delft
he built the town hall and the monument to William I; and in 1627, at
Rotterdam, he cast in bronze his masterpiece, the noble statue of
Erasmus which for some years sat calmly intact amid the ruins of the
Second World War. Some of the loveliest Dutch structures dating from
this period lost their lives in that failure of statesmanship.</p>
<p>Pottery shone among the minor arts. In Rotterdam and Delft tiles were
an industry that good taste made an art. Delft raised its faience to a
place in nearly every home in the Netherlands. About 1610, soon after
the opening of Dutch trade with the Orient, Delft potters began to
imitate Chinese ware, and produced a thin blue majolica called
Hollandsch porse- leyn}^^ Soon half the West-European world displayed
Delft pottery on its walls or shelves.</p>
<p>The one major art in the Netherlands was painting. Never elsewhere in
known history — not excepting Renaissance Italy — did an art win such
pervasive popularity. For the years between 1580 and 1700 the art cata-
logues list fifteen thousand Dutch paintings.’“‘ Italian influence
dominated</p>

<p>toric heroes, or pagan gods. Nudes were out of style; in that damp
climate, with those stout forms, nudity was no delight. The Italian cult
of beauty, refinement and dignity seemed out of place in this new
environment, which asked nothing more of art than the reproduction of
daily life and familiar scenes.</p>
<p>There was a sad side to this picture of a nation mad about pictures;
the artists who painted them lived for the most part in poverty and low
esteem. In Flanders the Archduke, the lords, and the bishops paid their
chosen artists well. But in Holland the painters, competing
individually, produced for the common market, and they reached customers
largely through dealers who grew up between producer and purchaser and
who knew how to buy cheap and sell dear. Dutch artists rarely received
high prices: at the crest of his fame Rembrandt earned only 1,600
guilders by The Night Watch, van Goyen only 600 by his View of The Hague
and jmuch less for the rest; Jan Steen painted three portraits for
twenty-seven guilders, Isaac van Ostade sold thirteen of his pictures
for a like sum. Many Dutch artists had to do extraneous work to butter
their bread: van Goyen sold tulips, Hobbema was a tax collector, Steen
kept an inn.^®* The artists themselves were so numerous that they
glutted their market. A list of the famous ones would fill pages, and a
list of their treasured works would crowd a book. Shall we thank them in
a footnote?*</p>

<p>Herman, son of Frans Hals and his wife Anneke. The next record is
from a police court (1616), telling how Frans Hals, arrested for undue
beating of his wife, was severely reprimanded, and was dismissed on his
under- taking to be more gentle and to avoid drunken company. Seven
months later Anneke died; five months thereafter (1617) Frans married
Lysbeth Reyniers; nine days later she gave him the first of ten
children.^®* He has left us an admirable picture of himself and this
second wife.^®* She lived with him through his remaining forty-seven
years, putting up with all his impecuniosity and drunken bouts. There
was nothing very attractive about him except that he was a great painter
and a jolly soul.</p>
<p>He was already thirty-six when he achieved a major success. The Ban-
quet of the Officers of St. forts’ Shooting Guild}’^ — the first of the
five Doelen pictures that give Hals his rank. The doelen were the
headquarters of volunteers who practiced marksmanship, held competitions
and social gatherings, and served as communal militia. Occasionally the
officers of such guilds would pay an artist to paint their portraits as
a group, each individual insisting that his prominence in the picture
should be proportioned to his grade in the company and his contribution
to the cost. Here, then, are these officers, decked out in their best
finery, gathered around a feast, with one of them carrying the colorful
standard of the company. Hals earned his fee, for each of these heads is
an individual and powerful portrait, each different, each a biography
and a masterpiece.</p>
<p>We do not hear of another such assignment till eleven years later,
but in the interval he produced pictures that are among the prizes of
Dutch art: The Herring Seller^’’’’ — again a history in a face; The
Merry Trio and Junker Ramp and His Girl, both in New York; the famous
Laughing</p>
<p>Cavalier<sup>°</sup> — self-confidence incarnate, with all his
fortune on his back in ruff and frills and flowered cloak, and a smile
almost as subtle as La Gio- conda’s. And in this period (1624?) Frans
painted his Self -Fortrait^^ — a strong and handsome face, with wistful
eyes denying the pride of the fine clothes and folded arms. The man was
a bruised shuttlecock between the hunger for perfection and the thirst
for drink.</p>
<p>In 1627 came the second Doelen group, another Officers of St. Joris’
Guild, not so clear and bright as the first; Hals deliberately turned
for a time from the easy brilliance of strong colors to the more
difficult manip- ulation of the minor keys — half tones, gray shadows,
softer outlines. An- other Doelen of that year, St. Adriaen’s Shooting
Guild,^^^ is also in sub- dued tones. The shooters must have been
pleased, for they commissioned Hals to paint them again (1633);”* now
the artist recalled his colors and displayed his genius for making every
face interesting and unique. In 1639 he painted still another Officers
of St. Joris’ Guild, but here the individual is lost in the crowd. All
in all, these Doelen are among the out-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>(chap, xvih</p>
<p>standing group pictures of all time. They illustrate the emergence of
the middle class into proud prominence in Dutch history and art.</p>
<p>In his second period (1626-50) Hals painted portraits that cry out
for remembrance: The Jolly Toper, under a hat large enough to cover
a</p>
<p>multitude of drinks; The Sand Runner, disheveled and ragged and</p>
<p>charming; The Gypsy (or La Bohemienne), smiling and bulging in</p>
<p>the Louvre; The Jester in Amsterdam; the fanciful Balthazar Coy-</p>
<p>mans in Washington; and, as the climax of this maturity, Hals’s
supreme picture. The Regents of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, so like, so
unlike,</p>
<p>Rembrandt’s Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild, painted twenty -one years
afterward.</p>
<p>Frans’s incalculable carouses, though they do not seem to have
injured his art, had hurt his standing even in a land and a time that
took occasional intoxication as an ode to joy. He continued to paint
pictures that would have made any artist famous: Hille Bobbe,^^’’ “the
witch of Haarlem”; the disenchanting Descartes ^^^ — enormous eyebrows,
enormous nose, eyes say- ing “Dubito”; and (painted at the age of
eighty) Young Man in a Slouch Hat.^^^ But meanw hile disasters
multiplied. In 1639 Hals’s son Pieter was sent to an insane asylum at
municipal expense. In 1641 his wayward eldest daughter, at her mother’s
request, was put into a workhouse. By 1650 Frans was destitute. In 1654
the local baker sued him for a debt of two hundred gulden, and attached
the painter’s goods. In 1662 the broken old man applied for and received
poor relief. Two years later the Haarlem council voted him a yearly
pension and an immediate gift of three loads of peat to fire his
hearth.</p>
<p>Probably as additional alms he was given, in this year 1664, a
commission to paint two pictures: The Regents of the Almshouse and The
Women Regents of the Almshouse. The male group shows the unsteady hand
of the artist’s eighty -four years; many features are daubed in vaguely.
But in the companion piece, the Regentessen, the old skill has
surprisingly re- turned; here are five souls drawn out into their
obedient faces, five old women wasted with unwanted tasks, prim and
stern with their puritan code, forgetting the joys and frolics of their
youth; yet through those grim features somehow shines a timid
kindliness, a weary sympathy. These final pictures, last flames of the
painter’s fire, now, with the great Doelen canvases, hang in the Frans
Hals Museum that Haarlem built on the site of that almshouse.</p>
<p>He died a pauper (1664), but he was given honorable burial in the</p>
<p>chancel of St.- Bavon’s in the city whose fame rests upon a long
-resisted siege and the works of her greatest son. For two centuries
thereafter he was almost forgotten. His pictures sold for pittances, or
by auction, or not at all. If historians of art remembered him it was to
note the narrowness</p>
<p>CHAP, XVIIl)</p>
<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>of his range — no religious pictures, no mythologies, no histories,
no land- scapes, no nudes; or the apparently careless haste of his
method — no pre- liminary sketches, but rapid daubs and slashes of color
that relied on sug- gestion and the beholder’s memory to fill in
details. Today a possibly exaggerated acclaim balances that long
neglect, and one generous critic considers Hals “the most brilliant
executant of portraits the world has seen.”^^® Where time, the sa fest
judge, so vacillates in its judgment, let us be content to admire.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>REMBRANDT HARMENSZ VAN RIJN; 1606-69</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born at Leiden to a prosperous miller, Gerrit Harmens, who</p>
<p>added “van Rijn” to his name, probably because his house overlooked
th e Rhine. The artist must have loved his father, for he painted him
eleven times or more: in lordly hat and chain,^*^ and as a
money-changer,^^^ and as A Noble Slav ^^^ — a strong, well-modeled face
bristling with character — and, in 1629, as a man sombered with age.’^^
His mother too he pictured a dozen times, most memorably in the Old
Woman of the Vienna Gallery, worried and worn. In the Rijksmuseum at
Amsterdam we see her poring over a Bible. If, as some believe, she was a
Mennonite, we can better under- stand Rembrandt’s predilection for the
Old Testament, and his closeness to the Jews.</p>
<p>At fourteen he entered the University of Leiden. But he thought
in</p>
<p>other forms than ideas or words; after a year he withdrew and
persuaded his father to let him study art. He did so well that in 1623
he was sent to Amsterdam as pupil to Pieter Lastman, who was then rated
the Apelles of the age. Lastman had returned from Rome to Holland with a
classic emphasis on correct drawing; from him, probably, Rembrandt
learned to be a superlative draftsman. But after a year in Amsterdam the
restless youth hurried back to Leiden, eager to paint after his own
fashion. He drew or painted almost everything that he saw, including
hilarious ab- surdities and shameless obscenities.^^® He improved his
art with fond experiments in self-portraiture; the mirror became his
model; he has left us more self-portraits (at least sixty-two) than many
great painters have left paintings. Among these early autoritratti is a
charming head in The Hague: Rembrandt at twenty-three, handsome of
course (for all mirrors show us handsome), hair carelessly tossed about
with young superiority to conventions, eyes alert and proud with the
confidence of proved ability.</p>
<p>In fact, he had already established himself. In 1629 a connoisseur
paid him a hundred florins for a picture — quite a fee for a young
competitor in a land where painters were as numerous as bakers, and not
so amply fed.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVIH</p>
<p>His first themes, after himself and his parents, were Biblical.
Jeremiah Mourning the Destruction of Jerusalem<sup>’</sup>^ has the
mystic aura that dis - tinguishes Rembrandt’s religious pictures, and
Simeon in the Temple^^’’ catches completely the spirit of Nunc dimittis
servum utum, Domine. So many commissions came from Amsterdam that
Rembrandt went back to it in 1631 and lived there the rest of his
life.</p>
<p>Within a year of his arrival he painted one of the world’s
masterpieces. The Anatomy Lesson of Professor Nicolaes Tulp}^^ There had
already been several anatomies in Dutch painting. No precedents were
broken, no modesty violated, when the distinguished surgeon, four times
burgomaster of Amsterdam, commissioned Rembrandt to picture him giving a
demon- stration in anatomy in the Hall of the Surgeons’ Guild; he
planned to present the painting to the guild as a memorial to his
professorship. It was probably Dr. Tulp who chose the seven “students”
to share the picture with him — obviously not pupils but men of maturity
and standing either</p>
<p>Commissions now flowed in — in two years, forty. With money in his
pocket and hunger in his blood, the artist was ripe for marriage (1634).
Saskia Uylenborch had a lovely face, dancing eyes, hair of silk and
gold, a comfortable figure and fortune; what could be lovelier than the
Saskia in Cassel? She was the orphaned daughter of a wealthy lawyer and
magis- trate. Perhaps her cousin, an art dealer, had induced her to sit
to Rem- brandt for a portrait. Two sittings sufficed for a proposal.
Saskia brought a dowry of forty thousand guilders, which made the future
bankrupt one of the richest artists in history. She became a good wife
despite her money. She bore patiently with her mate’s absorbed genius;
she sat for many pic - tures, though they revealed her expanding form;
she let him deck her out in strange costumes for the rosy Flora now in
London and the simpler, wistful Flora in New York. We see his happiness
in a Dresden painting where he holds her on his knee, irradiates the
canvas with his smile, and raises a tall tumbler to his physical and
financial ecstasy.</p>
<p>In these grateful years (1634-42) he turned out one masterpiece after
another. He continued to picture himself: in the Self-Portrait (1634) in
the Louvre, handsome and jolly, with jewels in his hat and a gold chain
on his chest; and again that year in An Officer^^^ — ^magnificent in a
world- conquering hat; and in 1635 with a gorgeous hat whose plume
tickles the</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>sky. Looking for character rather than beauty, he painted (1634) the
Old Lady who looks down upon us, from the walls of the National Gallery
in London, with a face corrugated by the years, and, a year later, the
Old Woman in an Armchair in New York. Among the human ruins of Am-
sterdam he found an octogenarian whom he dressed in turban and robes and
pictured in An Oriental}^’’ He had a penchant for collecting costumes,
jewelry, swords, fancy hats and shoes; see them (except the sword) in
Martin Daey^^^ — with lace on his gloves, frills on his pants, and
shields on his shoes. Now, too, he painted timeworn religious subjects
with a fresh sincerity, taking his models from the old men and young
women whom he met in the streets — each picture so remarkable in
technique, so strildng in its manipulation of light, and so moving in
the intensity of its feeling, that any one of them might be defended as
the artist’s best; let The Sacrifice of Abraham^^^ and The Angel Raphael
Leaving Tobias^^^ serve as ex- amples. From these blessed years came
some famous portraits, like The Lady with a Fan^^* and A Man with
Gloves^^^ — ^both defying words.</p>
<p>The last achievement of this period, and perhaps the greatest picture
that Rembrandt ever painted, was the immense canvas (fourteen by twelve
feet) that history knows as The Night Watch, but that is more properly
named Captain Coccfs Company of Harquebusiers ( 1 642 ) No detail is
unfinished in that vast expanse, no shade of darkness or incidence of
light is uncalculated, no contrast of color is unexplored. In the center
the proud captain stands in brown and white and red; at his left a
lieutenant in golden yellow boots and coat and hat; swords gleam, pikes
flash, pennants wave; at the right the fife-and-drum corps; the company
emerges from its head- quarters, apparently for some festival parade.
Rembrandt had signed a con- tract with each of the sixteen persons to be
painted, each paying one hun- dred florins. Many felt that equal pay had
not been rewarded with equal prominence in the picture; some complained
that he had put them too deeply in shadows, or had neglected to make
them recognizable by their friends. Few further group commissions came
to his studio, and his pros- perity began to wane.</p>
<p>It must have been high in 1639, for in that year he bought a spacious
house in the Joden-Breedstraet, a street inhabited by well-to-do Jews.
It cost him thirteen thousand -florins, an enormous sum, which he never
suc- ceeded in paying off. Probably it was intended to shelter not only
his family but his pupils, his studio, and his growing collection of
antiquities, curiosities, and art. After paying half the purchase price
in the first year of occupancy, he let the rest remain as a debt, on
which the unpaid interest rose to a point that eventually drove him to
bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his beloved Saskia was declining in health. She had borne
him three children, but each died in childhood, and their painful birth
and</p>

<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>tragic end weakened her hold on life. In 1641 she gave birth to a
son, Titus, who survived; but in 1642 she passed away. Her will left all
her possessions to Rembrandt, with the proviso that on his remarriage
the remainder of her legacy should be transferred to her son. A year
after her death Rembrandt painted her from loving memory.</p>
<p>That loss darkened his mood; thenceforth he seemed obsessed with
thoughts of death. Though deeply affectionate within his family, he had
always preferred privacy to company; now he courted a somber sohtude.
When he was painting he brushed premature viewers away, telling them,
“The smell of paint is not good for the health.”^®’ He was not a
cultured man of the world, like Rubens. He read little, hardly anything
but the Bible. He lived in a wordless realm of color, shadow, and light,
as varied as the world of letters, but alien to it and unique. He had
difficulty in donning the social graces when sitters came, and in making
small talk to keep them amused and still. They came in less number when
they found that Rembrandt, like most of his predecessors, was not
content to make a sketch from a sitting or two and then paint from the
sketch, but preferred to paint directly on the canvas, which required
many sittings; moreover, he had an impressionistic way of painting what
he thought or felt, rather than merely what he saw, and the result was
not always flattering.</p>
<p>It did not help him that his house was in the Jewish quarter. He had
long since made friends with many Jews; he had engraved a portrait of
Manassah ben Israel in 1636; now (1647) he painted on wood the dark face
of the Jewish physician Ephraim Bonus. Almost surrounded by Hebrews, and
evidently liking them, he found subjects increasingly among the
Portuguese and Spanish Jews of Amsterdam. Perhaps he knew Baruch
Spinoza, who lived in that city from 1632 till 1660. Some have thought
that Rembrandt himself was Jewish; this is improbable, for he was
christened and reared in a Protestant faith, and his features were
completely Dutch. But he had no perceivable prejudice in religion or
race. There is an especial depth of sympathetic understanding in his
pictures of Jews. He was fascinated by their old men, their beards
dripping wisdom, their eyes remembering grief. Half the Hebrew Calvary
is in the face of An Old Jew (1654) in the</p>
<p>Leningrad Hermitage, and in the Portrait of a Rabbi (c. 1657) in
London. This last is the rabbi who, after Rembrandt’s bankruptcy, gave
him spiritua l comfort and material aid.</p>
<p>In 1649 we find him painting Hendrikje Stoffels in Bed,^^^ and we
per- ceive that he has taken a mistress. She had been Saskia’s maid; she
stayed with the widowed artist, took faithful care of him, and soon
consoled him with the warmth of her body. He did not marry her, for he
was loath to relinquish Saskia’s legacy to Titus, still a boy of eight.
As he painted</p>
<p>Hendrikje in 1652,^*® she was tolerably fair, with eyes of haunting
wistful- ness. It was probably she who posed for two studies in nudity,
in 1654,</p>

<p>Bathsheba at the Bath^*’^ and A Woman Wading, both of them glories of
color and amplitude. In July of that year she was summoned before the
elders of the parish church, was severely reprimanded for adultery, and
was excluded from the Sacrament. In October she bore him a child; Rem-
brandt acknowledged it as his and managed to get it safely baptized. He
learned to love his mistress as deeply as he had loved his wife; how
else could he have put such tenderness in her face when he painted her
in 1658 in the red robe that matched her hair?^^^ She was a good
stepmother to Titus, who was growing up into a bewitching lad. See him
in the Metro- politan Museum of Art, aged fourteen, as lovely as a girl,
with the wonder- ing eyes of youth, mystified by life and only half
secure under paternal love; or, again, in the Wallace Collection, a year
older. We can weakly imagine what a solace he must have been to
Rembrandt, who in this year found economic realities crashing about his
head.</p>
<p>He labored to make ends meet. Some great religious pictures belong to
this period (1649-56) of adultery and debt: Jacob Blessing His Grand-
children,^<em>’^ Christ at the Fountain,</em>** Christ and the Woman of
Samaria,<strong>^ and a Descent from the Cross.</strong>^ However, in
Protestant Holland ecclesi- astical subjects were not in demand. He
tried his hand at mythologies, but succeeded only when he could clothe
the figures; Dame**‘* is uninviting, but Athene<strong>^ and
Mars</strong>’* are unsurpassed in their kind. He continued to paint
portraits of arresting character. Nicolaes Bruyningh<em>^ is snatched
directly from a vivid moment of life and thought; and Jan Six</em>^* is
the Dutch burgomaster at his strongest and best. And about this time
Rem- brandt painted some nameless figures profoundly studied: The Man
with the Golden Helmet,<em>^’</em> The Polish Rider, <em>^^ The
Centurion Cornelius-</em>^* beside these, most portraits seem surface
sheen.</p>
<p>Rembrandt was fifty when disaster came. He had seldom bothered to
count his debits and credits; he had recklessly bought house tnd art,
even shares in the Dutch East India Company;‘®® now, as patronage lagged
far behind maintenance, he found himself hopelessly in debt. In 1656 the
Orphans’ Chamber of Amsterdam, to protect Titus, transferred the house
and grounds to the son, though the father was for a while allowed to
live there. In July Rembrandt was declared bankrupt. His furniture,
paintings, drawings, and collections were sold in costly haste
(1657-58), but the proceeds fell far short of his obligations. On
December 4, 1657, he was evicted. He moved from one house to another,
until at last he settled on the Rozengracht, in the Jewish ghetto. Out
of the wreck some seven thousand florins were salvaged for Titus. He and
Hendrikje, to protect Rembrandt, formed a partnership by which they
could sell his remaining works without letting Them go to his creditors.
They seem to have taken loving care of the aging artist.</p>
<p>Amid these tribulations he continued to spawn masterpieces: the Man

<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xvin</p>
<p>Horseback, recently sold to the National Gallery, London, for 00,000;
the wonderful Head of an Old Man^^^ — a Karl Marx in octogenarian dis-
illusionment; the astonishingly vivid and natural Woman Cutting Her
Nails ^^’’ — perhaps part of the religious ritual that required
cleansing of the whole body on the eve of the Sabbath. Now, too, he
painted some startling self-portraits; Rembrandt uoith His Sketch-Book
(1657), in Dresden; the stern face and enveloped corpulence of the more
famous portrait (1658) in the Frick Collection at New York; the
full-figure portrait (1659) in</p>
<p>Vienna; the worried face (1659) in Washington.</p>
<p>In his final decade (1660-69) he was kept alive by his son and his
mis- tress, but his quarters were cramped, his studio was badly lighted,
his hand must have lost some of its decisiveness as the result of age
and drink. St. Matthew the Evangelist^^^ is coarse in its texture, but
the angel whispering in his ear is none other than Titus, now twenty and
still as fair as a bride. A nd then, in that year 1661, came the
master’s last triumph. The Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild}^^ The
staelmeesters — examiners and controllers of cloth — commissioned the
old artist to commemorate them in a group pic- ture to be hung in the
hall of their corporation. We would have forgiven some hesitancy in the
composition, some crudity in details, some careless- ness in the
incidence of light; but criticism is at a loss to find fault there. The
subdued foreground and background make the five main figures leap to the
eye, each of them “a single and separate person,” but all caught in the
living moment of their common thought. In many paintings of these broken
years the connoisseurs find signs of failing energy and technique —
simplicity of colors, neglect of details, a hasty sweep and crudity of
the brush. And yet even then we have such arresting pictures as The
Return of the Prodigal^^^ — an unforgettable portrayal of loving
forgiveness — and The Jewish Bride. This is wondrous fruit to come from
a dying tree.</p>
<p>But we have said nothing of his landscapes, his drawings, and his
etch- ings. Only a few of the landscapes stand out, but the drawings are
at the top of their kind. Famous are the pen-and-ink View of Amsterdam,
in Vienna, and An Old Woman Sitting, in Berlin. Rembrandt’s etchings are
prized as highly as any in the history of that painstaking art. One of
them, Christ Healing the Sick, came to be known as “The Hundred
-Guilder</p>
<p>Piece” because it was bough t for that unprecedented price (,250); in
1867, however, a copy of it brought 25,000 francs (0,000?).</p>
<p>Three hundred etchings, 2,000 drawings, 650 paintings — this is the
sur- viving ceuvre of Rembrandt, almost as widely known as Shakespeare’s
plays, almost as varied, original, and profound. Nearly all were from
his own hand, for though he had aides, none of them shared his secret
for re- vealing the invisible.^®* Some of his work was careless, some of
it repulsive, like the Flayed Ox in the Louvre. At times he was
engrossed in technique.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII)</p>
<p>FROM RUBENS TO REMBRANDT</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>at times he skimped it for the vision’s sake. He was as neutral as
nature be - tween beauty and ugliness, for to him truth was the ultimate
beauty, and a picture representing ugliness truthfully was beautiful. He
refused to idealize the figures in his Biblical paintings; he suspected
that those Old Testament Hebrews looked pretty much like the Jews of
Amsterdam; he pictured them so, and in consequence they rise from myth
or history into life. More and more, as he grew older, he loved the
simple people around him rather than men dehumanized by the pursuit of
gain. Where artists like Rubens sought their subjects among the
beautiful, the happy, or the powerful, Rembrandt lavished his
sympathetic art on the outcasts, the sick, the miser- able, even the
deformed; and though he made no show of religion, he seemed to embody,
unconsciously, the attitude of Christ and Whitman toward those who had
failed, or had refused to compete, in the war of each against all.</p>
<p>We take a last look at him in the self-portraits of his old age.
There is no vanity here; on the contrary, these are the autobiography of
defeat. As he pictured himself in 1660,^®® he was still facing life with
a blend of courage and resignation; the pudgy unshaved face was
quizzical but not sad; he was still moving forward. But in another
portrait<sup>®</sup> of the same year a worried look darkens and ridges
the face around the rubicund nose. In 1661 he saw himselP®® as baffled,
but shrugged his wrinkles philosophi- cally. And in his last year he
pictured himselP®® as having found peace in accepting the limits and the
wry humor of life. Hendrikje died in 1662, but Titus still blessed him
with the sight of youth; and in 1668 the old man rejoiced in the
marriage of his son. When, in that same year, the son fol- lowed the
mistress, the artist lost his hold on life. On October 8, 1669, the
death regist er of the Westerkerk recorded: “Rembrandt van Rijn, painter
. . . Leaves two children.”</p>
<p>His contemporaries hardly noticed his passing. None of them dreamed
of ranking him with Rubens, or even with Vandyck. Joachim von Sandrart,
his contemporary, wrote of him: “What he chiefly lacked was knowledge of
Italy, and of other places which afford opportunities for the study of
the antique and of the theory of art. 〔This now seems to us the secret
of his greatness.〕 Had he managed his affairs more prudently, and shown
more amenity in society, he might have been a richer man. . . . His art
suffered from his predilection for the society of the
vulgar.”<sup>®</sup> Ruskin agreed with the German historian of art:
“Vulgarity, dullness, or impiety will always express themselves through
art in brown and grays as in Rem- brandt. … It is the aim of the best
painters to paint the noblest things they can see by sunlight. It was
the aim of Rembrandt to paint the foulest things he could see — by
rushlight.”^®® But Eugene D elacroix, reflecting democratic developments
in France, thought, “Perhaps we shall one day find that Rem -</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XVIIl</p>
<p>brandt is a greater painter than Raphael. I write down — without
taking sides — this blasphemy, which will cause the hair of the
Academicians to stand on end.”^®* The tendency among art critics today
is to rate Rem - brandt above Raphael and Velazquez, equaled only by El
Greco.^^®</p>
<p>“Truth,” we perceive, is a function and vass al of time.</p>
<p>From Rubens to Rembrandt, what a gamut and chasm! — between joyous
light and somber shadow, between the abyss and the court, between the
happy sensuality of the Antwerp noble, at home in palaces and with
kings, and the Amsterdam bankrupt who knew the lower depths and was ac-
quainted with grief. To see these two men as the contrapuntal elements
of a mighty harmony is to feel in another way the greatness of the
little nation that had fought a giant empire, to feel the complexity of
a civilization that could produce, at one end, a Catholic culture gladly
adorning its unques- tioned creed with myths and its beloved shrines
with art, and, at the other, a Protestant culture that could nourish the
greatest artist and the greatest philosopher of the age.</p>
