<h4 id="chapter-xxxii-german-philosophy">CHAPTER XXXII German
Philosophy</h4>
<p>1789-1815</p>
<p>O UR approach to the idealistic philosophy of Kant and his successors
is obstructed by the current preemption of the word ideal for moral ex-
cellence, and by our habit, in an age of science and industry, of
thinking of things perceived, and seldom of the process of perception
itself. The oppo- site attitudes competed in Greek philosophy, where
Democritus took atoms as his starting point, and Plato took ideas. In
modern philosophy Bacon stressed knowledge of the world, Descartes began
with the thinking self. Hobbes reduced everything to matter, Berkeley to
mind. Kant gave German philosophy its distinctive character by arguing
that its prime task is the study of the process by which we form ideas.
He admitted the reality of external objects, but insisted that we can
never know what they objectively are, since we know them only as changed
by the organs and processes of percep- tion into ou r ideas.
Philosophical “idealism” is therefore the theory that nothing is known
to us except ideas, and that therefore matter is a form of mind.*</p>

</ol>
<p>Here, as so often in literary history, the man has proved more
interesting than his books. These suffer erosion by the flux of fashions
in ideas and forms, but the study of a soul picking its way through the
labyrinth of life is a living lesson in philosophy, an ever moving
picture of experience mold- ing character and transforming thought.</p>
<p>Johann Gottlieb Fichte crowded a brave variety of experience into his
fifty-two years. His father was a Saxon ribbon weaver. His mother prayed
that her boy should be a pastor; he agreed, and after some local
schooling he was sent to Jena to study theology. The more he studied the
more he won- dered and doubted. A village preacher gave him a Refutation
of the Errors of Spinoza ; Fichte was charmed by the errors, 2 and
decided that he was not fit for a pastorate. Nevertheless he graduated
in the faculty of theology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cf. Charles Singer, historian of science: “Consciousness is the
ultimate datum, the thing taken for granted; the judge, as it were,
before whom science must recite its narrative of experiences of
phenomena. Their recital, and that alone, is the role of science.”
1</li>
</ul>
<p>636</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>637</p>
<p>Almost penniless, he walked from Jena to Zurich to secure a post as
tutor. There he fell in love with Johanna Maria Rahn, and was formally
betrothed to her; but they agreed not to marry till he was financially
adult.</p>
<p>He moved to Leipzig, tutored, read Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason,
and was fascinated. He made his way to Konigsberg, and presented Kant a
Versuch einer Kritik alter Offenbarung ( Essay toward a Critique of All
Revelation, 1792). The old philosopher balked at Fichte’s request for a
loan, but helped him to find a publisher for his treatise. The printer
neglected to state the author’s name; when a critic ascribed the essay
to Kant, Kant named the author and praised the book; Fichte was at once
received into the not quite “serene brotherhood of philosophes.” 3 He
did not do so well with the theologians, for the argument of his
treatise was that although revelation does not prove the existence of
God, we must ascribe our moral code to God, if that code is to be
accepted and obeyed by mankind.</p>
<p>On Kant’s recommendation Fichte found remunerative employment as a
tutor in Danzig. His betrothed now agreed to add her savings to his
income, and on that basis they were married in 1793. He further
signalized the year by publishing, anonymously, two vigorous essays. In
the Restoration of Freedom of Thought by the Princes of Europe he began
by praising some enlightened rulers, and berated princes who obstructed
the progress of the human mind; and he mourned the wave of repression
that had followed the death of Frederick the Great. Reform is better
than revolution, for a revolu- tion can throw man back into barbarism;
and yet a successful revolution can advance mankind as much in half a
century as reform could have done in a thousand years. Then Fichte
addressed his readers — at a time when feudalism was still in force
through most of Germany:</p>
<p>Hate not your princes but yourselves. One of the sources of your
misery is your exaggerated estimate of these personages, whose minds are
warped by an enervating education, indulgence, and superstition…. These
are the men who..re exhorted to suppress freedom of thought…. Cry aloud
to your princes that you will never permit your freedom of thought to be
filched from you….</p>
<p>The Dark Ages are over,… when you were told in God’s name that you
were herds of cattle set on earth to fetch and carry, to serve a dozen
mortals in high place, and to be their possessions. You are not their
property, not even, God’s property, but your own…. Yo u will now ask the
prince who wishes to rule you, By what right? If he replies, By
inheritance, you will ask, How did the first of your line obtain the
right?… The prince derives his whole power from the people. 4</p>
<p>The second tract, Essay toward the Correction of the Public’s
Judgment on the French Revolution, was still more radical. Feudal
privileges should not be hereditary; they exist by consent of the state,
and should be termi- nable at the state’s convenience. Likewise with
ecclesiastical property: it exists through permission and protection by
the state, and may be national- ized when the nation’s need and will so
decree. The French National Assem - bly did this, and was justified.
Here the fragment ends.</p>
<p>Only by noting that these pronouncements were published
anonymously</p>
<p>638 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>can we understand how Fichte won an invitation (December, 1793) to
the chair of philosophy at Jena. Duke Charles Augustus was still an
easygoing lord of Weimar and Jena, and Goethe, who supervised the
university fac- ulty, had not yet decided that the French Revolution was
a Romantic dis- ease. 2 * * 5 So Fichte began his courses at Jena in the
Easter term of 1794. He was a persuasive teacher, a lively orator, who
could put feeling into philosophy and make metaphysics lord of all; but
his impetuous temper was thoroughly unprofessorial, and promised
intellectual turbulence.</p>
<p>Five of his ea^ly discourses were published in 1794 as Einige
Vorlesungen iiber die Bestimmung des Gelehrtes ( Some Lectures on the
Vocation of the Scholar). Their thesis, that the state will in some
amiable future disappear and leave men really free, was almost as
anarchistic as Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, published
a year before:</p>
<p>Political society is no part of the absolute purpose of human life,
but is only a possible means to the formation of a perfect society. The
state constantly tends toward its own annihilation, since the final aim
of all government is to render itself superfluous. We may have to wait
for aeons, but one day all political combinations will become
unnecessary. 6</p>
<p>To this prospect — made palatable to princes by its distance — Fichte
added another Pisgah view: “The ultimate aim of society is the perfect
equality of all its members.” This was a resounding echo of Jean
-Jacques, and Fichte did not disown the parentage: “Peace be with
Rousseau’s ashes, and blessings on his memory; for he has kindled fires
in many souls.” 7 The Romantic rebels who were to congregate in Jena in
1796 welcomed this summons to utopia. “The greatest metaphysician now
alive,” wrote Friedrich von Schle - gel to his brother, “is a popular
writer. You can see it in hi s famous book on the Revolution. Contrast
the contagious eloquence of the ‘Lectures on the Scholar’ with
Schiller’s declamations. Every trait in Fichte’s public life seems to
say, ‘This is a man.’” 8</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Philosopher</li>
</ol>
<p>What was this metaphysics that so charmed the Romantics? Its
central</p>
<p>hesis was that the individual, self-conscious ego — whose essence is
will and</p>
<p>whose will is free — is the center and sum of all reality. Nothing
could have</p>
<p>pleased the Romantics more. But the matter was not as simple as
Friedrich von Schlegel’s Lucinde. Fichte himself, after publishing his
Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre ( Foundation of the Whole
Science of Knowl- edge, 1794), found it necessary to clarify it , post
factum (1797), by a Z weite Einleitung ( Second Introduction), and by a
Neue Darstellung</p>
<p>( New Presentation) , each of which added fresh absurdities. The key
word itself needed a key: Wissenschaftslehre meant a study of the shaft
or trunk of knowledge — i.e., the mind — or, to put it in one forbidding
word, episte- mology.</p>
<p>Fichte began by dividing philosophers into two groups: “dogmatists”
or</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>639</p>
<p>“realists,” who are confident that objects exist i ndependently of
the mind; and idealists, who believe that all experience and all “facts”
are mental per - cepts, and that therefore all reality, so far as we can
know, is part of the perceiving mind. He objected to realism that it is
logically driven to a mechanistic determinism which makes consciousness
superfluous and under- mines responsibility and morality — whereas
freedom of the will is among the most immediate and tenacious of our
convictions. Fichte objected fur- ther that no philosophy which begins
with matter can explain consciousness, which is manifestly immaterial.
But the main problems of philosophy con- cern this mysterious reality
called consciousness.</p>
<p>So Fichte began with the conscious self — the Ego, Ich, or I. He
acknowl- edged an external world, but only as known to us through our
perceptions. These, by their very process — the interpretation of
sensations through mem- ory and purpose — transform the object into a
part of the mind. (So a word as a sound is quite different from that
word as interpreted by experience, context, and aim; and a storm, which
to mere sensation is a confused and meaningless medley of messages
falling upon various senses, becomes in per- ception-through memory,
circumstance, and desire — a stimulus to meaning- ful action.) Fichte
concluded that we must assume an external object or “non - Ego” as cause
of our external sensations, but that the “object” as inter - preted by
perception, memory, and will is a construct of the mind. From this point
of view both the subject and the object are parts of the Ego, and
nothing outside of the Ego can ever be known.</p>
<p>All this is but one aspect of Fichte’s philosophy. Behind the self as
per - ceiving is the self as desiring, willing. “The ego is a system of
im pulses; its very nature is tendency or impulse.” “The whole system of
our ideas depends upon our impulses and our will.” 9 (Here Fichte
touches upon Spinoza’s “desire is the very essence of man,” and leads to
Schopenhauer’s view of “the world as will and idea.”) This restless will
is not part of that objective world which seems a slave to mechanistic
determinism; hence the will is free. This freedom is the essence of man,
for it makes him a responsi- ble moral agent, capable of freely obeying
a moral law.</p>
<p>As he proceeded, Fichte developed Kant’s admiration of astronomic and
moral order into a new theology which assumed a moral law as governing
and supporting the universe as well as the character and communities of
men. Finally he identified this moral order of the universe — each part,
so to speak, doing its duty and thereby maintaining the whole — with
God. 10 The goal and duty of the free man is to live in harmony with
this divine moral order. That cosmic moral order is not a person but a
process, principally visible in the moral development of mankind. 11 The
“Vocation of Man” is to live in harmony with that divine order. — All
this again recalls Spinoza; but in another mood Fichte suggests Hegel:
the individual self or soul is mortal , 12 but it shares in the
immortality of that totality of conscious selves which is the Absolute
Ego, Idea, or Soul.</p>
<p>In Fichte’s philosophy we feel the anxious groping of a man who has
lost his transmitted religious faith but is struggling to find for
himself and his</p>
<p>640</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>readers or pupils a middle way between belief and doubt. In 1798 he
faced the problem again in Vber den Grund unseres Glaubens an eine
gottliche Weltsregierung (On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine
Governance of the World). He reaffirmed his conception of God as the
impersonal moral order of the world, but he allowed that some might
ascribe personality to this deity in order to vivify their concept and
devotion. However, he added that to conceive God as a tyrant, on whose
favor future pleasures depend, is to worship an idol; and those who
worship it should be called atheists.</p>
<p>An anonymous critic denounced the treatise as irreligious; others
joined in the attack; the government of Saxony confiscated all available
copies of Fichte’s essay, and lodged a complaint with the Weimar
government for allowing atheism to be taught within its jurisdiction.
The educational com- mittee at Weimar tried to quiet the matter with a
polite reply to the Saxons, but Fichte, who was no pacifist, issued two
pamphlets in public defense of his book (1799), one of them a direct
Appellation an das Publikum. The Weimar committee took this Appeal to
the Public as a challenge to its han- dling of the matter, and a rumor
reached Fichte that it would ask the univer- sity senate to impose a
public censure upon him. Arguing that this would violate academic
freedom, Fichte wrote to Privy Councilor Voight of Wei- mar that if such
a censure should be issued he would resign; and he added that several
other professors had agreed, in such case, to resign with him. The
Weimar committee (Schiller and Goethe assenting) issued a rescript to
the university senate desiring it to censure Fichte; then, accepting
Fichte’s threat and challenge, it dismissed him. Two petitions were
submitted by the students for a recall of this edict; they were ignored.
13</p>
<p>In July, 1799, Fichte and his wife moved to Berlin, where he was
warmly received by Friedrich von Schlegel, Schleiermacher, and others of
the Ro- mantic circle, who sensed the Romantic flavor of Fichte’s
imagination, and the heroic Ego-ism of his philosophy. To save the cost
of a separate house- hold, Fichte (with his unwilling wife) accepted
Schlegel’s invitation to live with him and Brendel Mendelssohn Veit. The
volatile philosopher liked the ensemble, and proposed to enlarge it. “If
my plan succeeds,” he wrote, “the Schlegels, Schelling, and we ourselves
will form one family, take a larger house, and have only one cook.” 14
The plan was not carried out, for Caroline von Schlegel did not get
along with Brendel; individualism is the snake in every socialist
paradise.</p>
<p>Fichte, however, kept a socialist tinge to the end. In 1 800 he
published an essay, Der geschlossene Handelsstaat (The Closed Commercial
State), in which he argued that foreign trade and manipulations of
currency enable the richer nations to drain poorer nations of their
metallic wealth; therefore the government should control all foreign
commerce, and possess all negoti- able bullion and currency. Armed with
this power, the state should guaran- tee to every individual a living
wage and an equitable share in the national product; in return the
individual must yield to the state the power to fix prices, and to
determine the place and character of his work. 16</p>
<p>Strangely contemporary with this radical pronouncement was a
religious</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXll)</p>
<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>641</p>
<p>ract, Die Bestimmung des Menschen ( The Vocation of Man, 1800), which
described God as the moral order of the universe, and rose to an ecstasy
of adoration:</p>
<p>Our faith,… our faith in duty, is only faith in Him, in His reason
and His truth…. That eternal Will is assuredly the Creator of the
World…. We are eternal because He is eternal.</p>
<p>Sublime and living Will! named by no name, compassed by no thought!…
Thou are best known to a childlike, devoted, simple mind….</p>
<p>I hide my face before Thee, and lay my hand upon my mouth…. How Thou
art, and seemest to Thine own being, I can never know…. Thou workest in
me the knowledge of my duty, of my vocation in the world of reasonable
beings; how I know not, nor need I know…. In the contempla- tion of
these Thy relations to me,… will I rest in calm blessedness. 16</p>
<p>Apparently dependent upon public lectures, and their publication, for
his livelihood, Fichte moved more and more toward Christian piety and
Ger- man patriotism. In 1805 he was called to the chair of philosophy at
the Uni- versity of Erlangen. He was making a new reputation for himself
there when the entry of Na poleon’s army into Germany (1806) compelled
him to seek a safer post. He crossed into East Prussia, and for a time
taught in Konigs- berg. Soon the vicinity of Napoleon’s troops at nearby
Friedland forced him to move — this time to Copenhagen. In August, 1807,
weary of homelessness, he made his-way back to Berlin. There he put
philosophy aside, and gave his energy to helping restore the pride and
spirit of a shattered and humiliated people.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Patriot</li>
</ol>
<p>On Sundays from December 13, 1807, to March 20, 1808, in the amphi-
theater of the Berlin Academy, Fichte delivered the lectures later
published as Reden an die deutsche Nation. They were his passionate
appeal to his people to regain their self-respect and courage, and to
take measures for raising themselves out of the desolation brought upon
them by the saber- rattling conceit of the Prussian military caste, the
inhumane Peace of Tilsit, and the brutal dismemberment of the Prussian
kingdom by the victorious Corsican. Meanwhile French soldiers were
policing the captured capital, and French spies were checking every
speech.</p>
<p>These Addresses to the German Nation are the most living part of
Fichte’s legacy, and are still warm with the feeling of the philosopher
turned patriot. They put aside the intellectual game of theoretical
logic, and faced the bitter realities of Prussia’s darkest year. He
spoke not to Prussia alone, but to all Germans; and though their
scattered principalities hardly constituted a na- tion, they used the
same language and needed the same goad. He sought to bring them some
unity by reminding them of German history, of famous victories — and
achievements in statesmanship, religion, literature, and art; and by
rejecting the hopeless materialism which he claimed to find in Eng- lish
life and theory, and the religious denudation of the French
Enlighten-</p>
<p>642 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>ment and Revolution. He spoke with reasonable pride of the mercantile
cities of the older Germany — the Nuremberg of Albrecht Diirer, the
Augs- burg of the Fuggers, the globe-running burghers of the Hanseatic
League. Present defeats, Fichte told his class and his country, must be
seen in the perspective of a brilliant past; this imprisonment of one
nation by another could not last; the German people had, in their
national character, the re- sources of body, mind, and will that would
make this present nadir end.</p>
<p>How? Fichte answered, By a complete reform of education: its
extension to every German child by governmental financing and
compulsion; and the transformation of its purpose from commercial
success to moral commit- ment. No more talk of revolution; there is only
one revolution, and that is the enlightenment of the mind and the
cleansing of the character. The child’s abilities must be developed by
the method of Pestalozzi; and they - men who “used God as a means to
introduce self -seeking into other worlds after the death of the mortal
body…. Such a religion… shall indeed be borne to the gra ve along with
the past age.” 17 It must be replaced by a reli - gion of moral
consciousness based upon an educated sense of communal
responsibility.</p>
<p>To produce this new type of man, Fichte believes, the pupils should
be “separated from the adult society,” and “form a separate and self
-contained community…. Physical exercises,… farming, and trades of
various kinds, in addition to the development of the mind by learning,
are included in this commonwealth.” 18</p>
<p>So isolated from the corruptions of the dying past, the pupils, by
work and study, should be stimulated to create an image of the social
order of mankind , as it ought to be, simply in accordance with the law
of reason. The pupil is so filled with ardent love for such an order of
things that it will be utterly impossible for him not to desire it, and
to work with all his strength to pro- mote it, when freed from the
guidance of education. 19</p>
<p>It is a splendid dream, recalling Plato’s republic, and forecasting
the so- cialist prophets who would stir the hopes of succeeding
centuries. It had litde influence on its time, and litde share (though
this has been magnified) in raising national ardor against Napoleon. 20
But Fichte was thinking of something larger than the expulsion of the
French from Prussia; he was try- ing to find a way of improving that
human character which, for good and evil, has made much of history. In
any case it was a noble dream, too con- fident, perhaps, in the power of
education over heredity, and sadly open to misconception and misuse by
authoritarian regimes; but, Fichte said, “as</p>

<p>The hardships of his flight from Erlangen to Konigsberg to Copenhagen
to Berlin had permanently weakened him. Shortly after completing his
Addresses to the German Nation his health broke down. He went to Teplitz
and partly recovered. In 1810 he was made rector of the new University
of Berlin. When Prussia opened its War of Liberation, Fichte aroused his
stu- dents to such patriotic fervor that nearly all of them enlisted. 22
Fichte’s wife volunteered for service as a nurse; she caught an
apparently fatal fever; he attended her during the day, and lectured at
the university in the evening; he caught the ailment from her; she
survived, he died, January 27, 1814. Five years later she was laid
beside him, in that good old custom of burial which allowed lovers and
mates to be joined again — even though but hair and bones — in symbol of
their having been, and of being now again, one.</p>

<p>Though he recog nized the existence of an external world, Fichte’s
phi - losophy mostly avoided it except as purified by perception.
Friedrich Wil- helm Joseph von Schelling, despite his aristocratic
preposition, readily accepted nature, and united it with mind in a
condominion constituting God.</p>
<p>He was the son of a propertied Lutheran pastor in Wiirttemberg, was
pledged to the ministry, and studied in the theological faculty at
Tubingen. There he, Holderlin, and Hegel formed a lusty trio of
scholastic radicals, celebrating the French Revolution, redefining
deity, and making new philo- sophic mixtures of Spinoza, Kant, and
Fichte. Schelling added a poem en- titled “The Creed of an Epicurean.”
23 One could safely predict, from these juvenalia, a respectably
conservative old age.</p>
<p>Like Fichte and Hegel, he served for some years as a tutor. His
essay, The l as Principle of Philosophy, published in 1795 when he was
twenty, caught the attention of Fichte, and won Schelling, at
twenty-three, an invitation to teach philosophy at Jena. He was content,
for a time, to describe himself as a follower of Fichte, and to accept
mind as the sole reality. But at Jena, and later at Berlin, he joined
the Romantics, and gave the body a passing ecstasy:</p>
<p>I can bear it no longer; I must live once more, must let my senses
have free play — these senses of which I have been well-nigh deprived by
the grand transcendental theories to which they have done their utmost
to convert me. But I too will nbw confess how my heart leaps and the hot
blood rushes through my veihs…. I have no religion but this, that I love
a well-shaped knee, a fair pltimp bosom, a slender waist, flowers with
the sweetest odors, full satisfaction of all my desires, the granting of
all that sweet love can ask. If I am obliged to have a religion (though
I can live most happily without it), then it must be the Catholic, such
as it was in the olden days, when priests and laity lived together,… and
in the house of God itself there was daily revelry. 24</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(chap. XXXII</p>
<p>It was fitting that so ardent a lover of tangible reality should
startle the idealistic nimbus that surrounded Fichte at Jena, and that
remained behind him when he left for Berlin. In Erste Entavurf ernes
Systems der Natur- philosophie ( First Sketch of a System of Natural
Philosophy, 1799), and in System des transzendentalen Idealismus (1800),
Schelling defined the main problem of philosophy as the apparent impasse
between matter and mind; it seems impossible to think of either
producing the other; and he concluded (in one more return to Spinoza)
that the best escape from the dilemma is to think of mind and matter as
two attributes of one complex but unified re- ality. “All philosophy
absolutely, which is based upon pure reason alone, is, or will become,
Spinozism.” But that philosophy, Schelling thought, was so rigidly
logical as to miss vitality. “A dynamic conception of nature must
necessarily bring about one essential change in the views of Spinozism….
In its rigidity Spinozism could be regarded, like Pygmalion’s statue, as
need - ing to be given a soul.” 25 *</p>
<p>To make this dualistic monism more conceivable Schelling proposed to
think of force or energy as the inner essence of both matter and mind.
In neither case do we know what this force is, but since we see it
taking in nature progressively subtler forms — from the mystery of
communicated motion, through the attraction or repulsion of particles,
the sensitivity of plants, or the groping, grasping pseudopodia of the
amoeba, to the quick intelligence of the chimpanzee and the conscious
reason of man, we may conclude that the basic reality, the one
omnipresent God, is neither matter nor mind by itself but their union in
one incredible panorama of forms and powers. Here Schelling was writing
poetry as well as philosophy, and both Wordsworth and Coleridge found in
him a fellow spirit struggling to build a new faith for souls
overwhelmed by science and hungering for God.</p>
<p>In 1803 he left Jena to teach in the recently opened University of
Wurz- burg. He continued to write philosophical treatises, but they
lacked the vigor of his Naturphilosophie. In 1809 his stimulating wife,
Caroline, died, and seamed to take half of his vitality with her. He
married again (1812), and wrote incontinently, but he published nothing
after 1809. Besides, by that time, Hegel had become the unchallengeable
Napoleon of philosophy.</p>
<p>In his declining years Schelling found comfort in mysticism, and
transcen- dental explanations for the apparent contradictions between a
loving God and a nature “red in tooth and claw,” and between the
determinism of sci- ence and the free will apparently needed for moral
responsibility. He took from Jakob Bohme (1575-1624) the idea that God
himself is a battleground between good and evil, so that nature
oscillates between struggling for order and relaxing into chaos; and in
man too there is something basically irra- tional. 26 Ultimately
(Schelling promised his readers) all evil will be over- come, and Divine
Wisdom will succeed in transforming even the follies and crimes of
mankind into good. 27</p>

<p>He had now the long discomfort of seeing Hegel gather all the crowns
of philosophy, and then to survive him by twenty-three years while the
“Young Hegelians” divided their master’s dialectical remains between com
- munism and reaction. In 1841 King Frederick William IV called
Schelling to the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, hoping
that his conserva- tism would stem the radical tide. But Schelling could
not hold his audience, and he was left stranded and wondering by the
rush of events from philoso- phy to revolution.</p>
<p>Even so, Wordsworth had already put Schelling’s pantheistic vitalism
into majestic verse, 28 and Coleridge had ascribed to him, with certain
exceptions, “the completion, and the most important victories, of the
[Kantia n] revolu- tion in philosophy.” 29 And half a century after
Schelling’s death, Henri Bergson, regenerator of vitalism, called
Schelling “one of the greatest phi - losophers of all time.” 30 Hegel
would have demurred.</p>
<p>ill. hegel: 1770-1831</p>
<p>By reading Kant, Schopenhauer wrote about 1816, “the public was com -
pelled to see that what is obscure is not always without significance.”
Fichte and Schelling, he thought, took undue advantage of Kant’s success
with obscurity. But (Schopenhauer continued)</p>
<p>he height of absurdity in serving up pure nonsense, in stringing
together senseless and extravagant masses of words, such as had
previously been known only in madhouses, was finally reached in Hegel,
and became the instrument of the most beautiful mystification that has
ever taken place, with a result which will appear fabulous to posterity,
and will remain as a monument of German stupidity. 31</p>
<ol type="1">

<p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was alive and flourishing when this
dirge was published (1818); he survived another thirteen years. He came
of a Stuttgart middle-class family steeped in mysticism and piety. The
family property was mortgaged to send Georg to study theology at
Tubingen Semi- nary (1788-93). Holderlin the poet was there, and
Schelling came in 1790; together they deplored the ignorance of their
teachers, and applauded the victories of Revolutionary France. Hegel
developed a special fondness for Greek drama, and his praise of Greek
patriotism foreshadowed his own final political philosophy:</p>
<p>To the Greek the idea of his fatherland, the state, was the
invisible, the higher reality for which he labored…. In comparison with
this idea his own individuality was as nothing; it was its endurance,
its continued life, that he sought…. To desire or pray for permanence or
eternal life for himself as an individual could not occur to him. 32</p>
<p>646 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>After graduating from the seminary with a degree in theology, Hegel
dis- appointed his parents by refusing to enter the ministry. He
supported him- self by tutoring at Bern in the home of a patrician with
a substantial library; there, and later at Frankfurt, he read
Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Montesquieu, Locke,
Voltaire, Hume, Kant, Fichte; how could his ailing Christian faith
resist such a phalanx of doubters? The natu- ral rebelliousness of a
vigorous youth reveled in the pagan feast.</p>
<p>In the year 1796 he wrote a Life of Jesus ( Das Leben Jesu ), which
re- mained unpublished till 1905. It was in part ’an anticipation of Das
Leben Jesu (1835), with which David Strauss, a follower of Hegel,
launched a full-scale attack upon the Gospel story of Christ. Hegel
described Jesus as the son of Joseph and Mary; he rejected the miracles
ascribed to Christ, or explained them naturally; he pictured Christ as
defending the individual conscience against priestly rules; he ended
with the burial of the crucified rebel, and said nothing of a
resurrection. And he gave a definition of God which he was to hold to
the end: “Pure reason, incapable of any limitation, is the Deity
itself.” 33</p>
<p>In 1799 Hegel’s father died, leaving him 3,154 florins. He wrote to
Schel - ling asking advice in finding a town with a good library and ein
gates Bier. u Schilling recommended Jena, and offered to share his
quarters with him. In 1801 Hegel came, and was allowed to lecture at the
university as a Privatdozent, remunerated only by his pupils, who
numbered eleven. After three years of such servitude he was appointed
professor extraordinarius; and a year later, on Goethe’s intervention,
he received his fir st stipend — one hundred thalers. He never became a
popular teacher, but at Jena, as later in Berlin, he inspired in several
students a special attachment that penetrated the rough surface of his
language to the arcane vigor of his thought.</p>
<p>In 1801 he began, but left unfinished and unpublished, a significant
essay, Kritik der Verfassung Deutschlands (On the Constitution of
Germany, pub- lished in 1893). Looking out upon Germany, he was reminded
of the petty principalities that had divided Renaissance Italy and
opened it to foreign conquest, and he remembered Machiavelli’s plea for
a strong prince who would hammer these scattered pieces into a nation.
He put no faith in the Holy Roman Empire, and foretold its early
collapse. “Germany is no longer a state…. A group of human beings can
call itself a state only if it is joined together for the common defense
of the entirety of its property.” He called for the unification of
Germany, but he added: “Such an event has never been the fruit of
reflection, but only of force… The common multitude of the German
people… must be gathered into one mass by the force of a conqueror.”
35</p>
<p>Presumably he had no notion of summoning Napoleon, but when, in 1805,
Napoleon overwhelmed both the Austrians and the Russians at Auster-
litz, Hegel may have begun to wonder whether this man was destined to
unify not only Germany, but all Europe. When, in the following year, the
French Army was approaching Jena, and the future of Europe seemed at

<p>stake, Hegel saw Napoleon riding through Jena (October 13, 1806), and
wrote to his friend Niethammer:</p>
<p>I saw the Emperor — that world-soul — riding out to reconnoiter the
city. It is a truly wonderful sensation to see such an individual,
concentrated here at a single point, astride a single horse, yet
reaching across the world and ruling it…. To make such progress from
Thursday to Monday is possible only for that extraordinary man, whom it
is impossible not to admire…. All now wish good fortune to the French
Army. 36</p>
<p>On the next day the French Army prevailed; and some French soldiers,
eluding the eye of the world-soul, began to plunder in the city. One
group entered Hegel’s rented room. Seeing the Cross of the Legion of
Honor on a corporal’s coat, the philosopher expressed the hope that so
distinguished a man would treat a simple German scholar honorably. These
invaders set- tled for a botde of wine, but the spread of looting
frightened Hegel into taking refuge in the office of the university
vice-president.</p>
<p>On February 5, 1807, Christina Burkhardt, wife of Hegel’s landlord,
gave birth to a boy whom the absent-minded professor recognized as one
of his anonymous works. As the Duke of Saxe- Weimar was hard put to
finance the Jena faculty, Hegel thought it a good time to try another
city, woman, and task. On February 20 he left Jena to become editor of
the Bamberger Zeitung. Amid the turmoil he published (1807)
Phdnomenologie des Geistes. No one seems to have suspected that this
would later be ranked as his masterpiece, and as the most difficult and
seminal contribution to philoso- phy between Kant and Schopenhauer.</p>
<p>Irked by governmental censorship of his paper, Hegel left Bamberg</p>
<ol start="1808" type="1">
<li>to become headmaster of a Gymnasium in Nuremberg. He labored
conscientiously in this new field, teaching as well as directing, but he
longed for a secure and fitter berth in a distinguished and solvent
university. On September 16, 18 11, age forty-one, he married Marie von
Tucher, the twenty-year-old daughter of a Nuremberg senator. Shortly
thereafter Chris- tina Burkhardt surprised the couple with a visit in
which she offered them Hegel’s four -year-old son, Ludwig. His wife met
the situation bravely by adopting the boy into her family.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dreaming of a post in Berlin, Hegel accepted in 1816 an invitation
from the University of Heidelberg to be its first professor of
philosophy. His class began with five students, but grew to twenty
before the term was over. There he published (1817) his Encyclopedia of
the Philosophical Sciences. It pleased both the intelligentsia and the
government of Berlin much more than his Logik, which had appeared there
in 1812. Soon the Prussian Minis- ter of Education invited him to come
and fill the chair of philosophy which had been left vacant since the
death of Fichte (1814). Hegel, now forty- seven, bargained until the
remuneration finally offered him atoned for his long wait. Besides the
two-thousand-thaler yearly salary he asked something to compensate for
the high rents and prices in Berlin, for the furniture he had bought,
and would now have to sell at a loss, for the cost of travel to</p>

<li>Logic as Metaphysics</li>
</ol>
<p>He begins with logic, not in our modern sense as the rules of
reasoning, but in the ancient and classic sense as the ratio, or
rationale, or basic mean- ing and operation, of anything, as when we use
geology, biology, or psy- chology for the meaning and operation of the
earth, life, or mind. So, to Hegel, logic studies the meaning and
operation of anything. Generally he leaves the operations to science, as
science leaves the meaning to philosophy. He proposes to analyze not the
words in reasoning but the reason or logic in realities. To the source
and sum of these reasons he will give the name of God, very much as
ancient mystics identified the deity with the Logos — the reason and
wisdom of the world.*</p>
<p>The perceiving mind gives specific meaning to objects by studying
their relationships, in space and time, with other objects remembered or
perceived. Kant had given to such relationships the name of categories,
and had listed twelve, chiefly: unity, plurality, and totality; reality,
negation, and limita- tion; cause and effect, existence and
nonexistence, contingency and neces- sity. Hegel adds many more:
determinate being, limit, multiplicity, attrac- tion and repulsion,
likeness and difference… Each object in our experience is a complex web
of such relationships; this table, for example, has specific place, age,
form, strength, color, weight, odor, beauty; without such spe- cific,
relations the table would be merely a confusion of obscure and separate
sensations; with them the sensations become a united perception. This
per- ception, illuminated by memory and pointed by purpose, becomes an
idea. Hence, for each of us, the world is our sensations — external or
internal — co- ordinated by the categories into perceptions and ideas,
mingled with our memories, and manipulated by our wills.</p>
<p>The categories are not things, they are ways and tools of
understanding, giving form and meaning to sensations. They constitute
the rationale and logic, the structure and reason, of each experienced
feeling, thought, or thing. Together they constitute the logic, reason,
Logos of the universe, as conceived by Hegel.</p>
<p>The simplest and most universal of the categories through which we
may seek to understand our experience is pure Being (Sein ) — being as
applied to</p>

<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>649</p>
<p>all objects or ideas without particularization. The universality of
this basic category is its fatality: by lacking any distinguishing form
or mark it cannot represent any existing object or idea. Hence the
concept of pure Being is in effect equivalent to its opposite category —
Nonbeing or Nothing ( Nichts ). Hence they readily mingle; that which
was not is added to Being, and de- prives it of its indeterminateness or
purity; Being and Nonbeing become something, however negative. This
mysterious Becoming (W er den) is the third category, the most useful of
all, since without it nothing could be con- ceived as happening or
taking form. All subsequent categories flow from similar combinations of
apparently contradictory ideas.</p>
<p>This Hegelian prestidigitation, producing the world (like Adam and
Eve) out of a conjunction, recalls the medieval idea that God created
the world out of nothing. But Hegel protests that his categories are not
things; they are ways of conceiving things, of making their behavior
intelligible, often predictable, sometimes manageable.</p>
<p>He asks us to allow some modification in the principle of
contradiction (so sacred in the old logic) — that A cannot be not- A.
Very well; but A may become not- A, as water can become ice or steam.
All reality, as conceived by Hegel, is in a process of becoming; it is
not a static Parmenidean world of Being but a fluid Heracleitean world
of Becoming; all things flow. All re- ality, in Hegel, all thoughts and
things, all history, religion, philosophy, are in constant evolution;
not by a natural selection of variations, but by the development and
resolution of internal contradictions, and the advance to a more complex
stage.</p>
<p>This is the famous Hegelian (formerly Fichtean) dialectic (literally
the art of conversation) of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis: an idea
or situation potentially contains its opposite, develops it, struggles
against it, then unites with it to take another transient form. A
logical discussion would follow the dialectical structure of exposition,
opposition, and reconciliation. Sensible deliberations — the weighing of
ideas and desires on the scale ( libera ) of ex- perience — would do
likewise. Interruption, as Mme. de Stael insisted, is the life of
conversation — but is its death if the contradiction is not pertinent
and resolved. Opposition absorbed is the secret of wisdom and the
perfection of victory. A true synthesis rejects neither the affirmative
nor the negative, but finds room for elements of each. Karl Marx, a
disciple of Hegel, thought that capitalism contained the seeds of
socialism; that the rival forms of economic organization must clash in a
war to the death; and that socialism would pre- vail. A more consistent
Hegelian would have predicted a union of both, as in Western Europe
today.</p>
<p>Hegel was the most thoroughgoing of Hegelians. He undertook to “de -
duce” the categories— to show how each of them necessarily resulted from
the resolution of contradictions in its predecessors. He organized his
argu- ments, tried to divide each of his works, on a triadic form. He
applied his dialectic to realities as well as to ideas: the repetitive
process of contradic- tion, conflict, and synthesis appears in politics,
economics, philosophy, and history. He was a realist in the medieval
sense: the universal is more real</p>
<p>61.sh THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>han any of its contained particulars: man includes all men, briefly
alive or durably dead; the state is realer, more important and longer
living, than any of its citizens; beauty has immortal power, makes many
wrecks and rhymes, though Pauline Bonaparte is dead and perhaps
Aphrodite never lived. Finally the compulsive philosopher carried his
parade of categories to the most real, inclusive, and powerful of them
all — the Absolute Idea that is the universal of all things and
thoughts, the Reason, structure, or law that upholds the cos- mos, the
Logos that crowns and rules the whole.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Mind</li>
</ol>
<p>The Phdnomenologie des Geistes was written at Jena while the Grande
Armee was approaching the city; it was published in 1807, when the
merci- less devastation of Prussia by the sons of the French Revolution
seemed to prove that somewhere in that historic groping from monarchy
through ter- ror to monarchy the mind of man had lost the road to
freedom. Hegel pro- posed to study the mind of man in its various
phenomena as sensation, perception, feeling; consciousness, memory,
imagination, desire, will, self- consciousness, and reason; perhaps at
the end of that long road he would find the secret of liberty. Not
frightened by that program, he would also study the human mind in
communities and the state, in art and religion and philosophy. The
product of his quest was his chef- d’oeuvre, eloquent and obscure,
challenging and discouraging, and pregnant with influence upon Marx and
Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Sartre.</p>
<p>The difficulty begins with the word Geist, which spreads a cloud of
am- biguities over ghost and mind and spirit and soul. We shall usually
translate it as mind, but in some contexts it may be better rendered as
spirit, as in Zeitgeist, the Spirit of the Age. Geist as mind is not a
separate substance or entity behind psychological activities; it is
those activities themselves. There are no separate “faculties”; there
are only the actual operations by which experience is transformed into
action or thought.</p>
<p>In one of his many definitions of Geist Hegel identified it with
conscious - ness. 38 Consciousness, of course, is the mystery of
mysteries, for, as the organ for interpreting experience, it cannot
interpret itself. Nevertheless, it is the most immediate, as well as the
most remarkable, fact known to us. Matter, which may be the outside of
mind, seems less mysterious, even though less directly known. Hegel
agrees with Fichte that we know objects only insofar as they become part
of us as subjects perceiving; but he never questions the existence of an
external world. When the object perceived is another individual
apparently endowed with mind, consciousness becomes self- consciousness
by opposition; then the consciously personal Ego is born, and becomes
uncomfortably aware that competition is the trade of life. Then, says
our tough philosopher, “each man” (potentially, ultimately, an d seldom
consciously) “aims at the destruction and death of the other,” 39 until
one of the two accepts subordination, 40 or is dead.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>651</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Ego is feeding upon experience, as if aware that it
must arm and strengthen itself for the trials of life. All that complex
process by which the Ego transforms sensations into perceptions, stores
these in mem- ory, and turns them into ideas, is used to illuminate,
color, and serve the desires that make up the will. The Ego is a focus,
succession and combina- tion of desires; percepts, ideas, memories,
deliberation, like arms and legs, are tools of the self or Ego seeking
survival, pleasure, or power. If the desire is a passion it is thereby
reinforced, for good or ill; it must not be con- demned
indiscriminately, for “nothing great in the world has been accom -
plished without passion.” 41 It may lead to pain, but that does not
matter if it contributes to the desired result. Life is made not for
happiness but for accomplishment. 42</p>
<p>Is the will (i.e., our desires) free? Yes, but not in the sense of
freedom from causality or law; it is free in proportion as it agrees
with the laws and logic of reality; a free will is one enlightened by
understanding and guided by reason. The only real liberation, for the
nation or the individual, is through the growth of intelligence; and
intelligence is knowledge coordinated and used. The highest freedom is
in the knowledge of the categories and their operation in the basic
processes of nature, and their union and harmony in the Absolute Idea,
which is God.</p>
<p>There are three ways in which man can approach this summit of under-
standing and freedom: through art, religion, and philosophy. Briefly in
the Phanomenologie, more fully in his posthumous V orlesungen iiber
Aesthetik, Hegel tried to bring the nature and history of art under the
triadic formulas of his system. Incidentally he revealed a surprising
knowledge of architec- ture, sculpture, painting, and music, and a
detailed acquaintance with the art collections of Berlin, Dresden,
Vienna, Paris, and the Netherlands. Art, he felt, was an attempt of the
mind — by intuition (i.e., direct, intense, per- sistent perception)
rather than by reason — to represent spiritual significance through a
sensory medium. He distinguished three major epochs of art: ( 1 ) the
Oriental, in which architecture sought to support the spiritual life and
mystical vision through massive temples, as in Egypt and India; (2) the
Greco-Roman Classical, conveying the ideals of reason, balance, and har-
mony through perfect sculptural forms; and (3) the Christian Romantic,
which has sought, through painting, music, and poetry, to express the
emotions and longings of the modern soul. In this third stage Hegel
found some seeds of degeneration, and suggested that the greatest period
of art was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Religion troubled and puzzled him in his declining years, for he
recog- nized its historic function in molding character and supporting
social order, but he was too fond of reason to care for the gropings of
theology, the ecstasies and sufferings of saints, the fear and worship
of a personal God. 43 He struggled to reconcile the Christian creed with
the Hegelian dialectic, but his heart was not in the effort, 44 and his
most influential followers inter- preted his God as the impersonal law
or Reason of the universe, and immor-</p>
<p>65 2 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>ality as the lingering — perhaps endless — effects of every soul’s
moment on the earth.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Phdnomenologie he revealed his true love —
philoso- phy. His ideal was not the saint but the sage. In his
enthusiasm he recognized no limit to the future extension of human
understanding. “The nature of the universe has no power which can
permanently resist the courageous effort of the intelligence; it must at
last open itself up; it must reveal all its depth and riches to the
spirit.” 45 But long before that culmination philosophy will have
perceived that the real world is not the world that we touch or see, but
the relationships and regularities that give them order and nobility,
the unwrit- ten laws that move the sun and the stars, and constitute the
impersonal mind of the world. To that Absolute Idea or cosmic Reason the
philosopher will pledge his loyalty; in it he will find his worship, his
freedom, and a quiet content.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Morality , Law, and the State</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1821 Hegel sent forth another major work — Grundlinien der
Philoso- phic des Rechts ( Outlines of the Philosophy of Right ). Recht
— right — is a majestic word in Germany, covering both morality and law
as kindred sup- ports of the family, the state, and civilization. Hegel
dealt with all of these in a magisterial volume which had lasting
influence upon his people.</p>
<p>The philosopher was now entering his sixth decade. He had become ac-
customed to stability and comfort; he was aspiring to some governmental
post; 46 he yielded readily to the natural conservatism of age.
Moreover, the political situation had drastically changed since he feted
France and ad- mired Napoleon: Prussia had risen in arms and fury
against Napoleon fleeing from Russia, had fought under Bliicher and had
overthrown the usurper; and now Prussia had reestablished itself on a
Frederician basis of victorious army and feudal monarchy as stanchions
of stability amid a people reduced by the costs of victory to desperate
poverty, social disorder, and hopes and fears of revolution.</p>
<p>In 1816 Jakob Fries, then holding the chair of philosophy at the
Univer- sity of Jena, published a treatise, Von Deutschem Bund und
Deutscher Staatsverfassung (On the German Confederation and the
Political Constitu- tion of Germany ) , in which he outlined a program
of reform that frightened the German governments into the harsh decrees
of the Karlsbad Congress (1819). Fries was dismissed from his

<p>Hegel gave half the preface of his book to denouncing Fries as a
danger- ous simpleton, and condemning as “the quintessence of shallow
thinking” Fries’s view that “in a people ruled by a genuine communal
spirit, life for the discharge of all public business would come from
below, from the peo- ple itself.” “According to a view of this kind,”
Hegel protested, “the world of ethics should be given over to the
subjective accident of opinion and</p>

<p>caprice. By the simple family remedy of ascribing to feeling the
labor… of reason and intellect, all the trouble of rational insight, and
of knowledge directed by speculative thinking, is of course saved.” 48
The angry professor vented his scorn upon street-corner philosophers who
construct perfect states any evening out of the rosy dreams of
immaturity. 49 Against such wishful thinking he proclaimed, as the
realistic basis of his philosophy (po- litical as well as metaphysical),
the principle that “what is rational is actual,</p>
<p>Civilization needs both morality and law, since it means living like
a citi- zen (civis), and therefore in a community; and a community
cannot survive unless it limits liberty in order to provide protection.
Morality must be a common bond, not an individual preference. Freedom
under law is a con- structive force; freedom from law is impossible in
nature and destructive in society, as in some phases of the French
Revolution. The restrictions laid upon individual liberty by custom
morality — the ethical judgments devel- oped in the evolution of a
community — are the oldest and broadest, the most lasting and
far-reaching measures taken by it for its continuance and growth. Since
such regulations are transmitted chiefly by the family, the school, and
the church, these institutions are basic to a society, and consti- tute
its vital organs.</p>
<p>Therefore it is foolish to let a family be founded by a love
marriage.</p>
<p>Sexual desire has its biological wisdom for continuing the species
and the community; but it contains no social wisdom for supporting a
lifetime part- nership in the management of property and children. 51
Marriage should be monogamous, and divorce should be difficult. The
property of the family should be held in common, but be managed by the
husband. 52 “Woman has her substantive destiny in the family, and to be
imbued with family devotion is her ethical frame of mind.” 53</p>
<p>Education should not [as in Pestalozzi and Fichte] make fetishes of
free- dom and play; discipline is the backbone of character. “The
punishment of children does not aim at justice as such; the aim is to
deter them from exer- cising a freedom still in the toils of nature, and
to raise the universal into their consciousness and will.” 54</p>
<p>Nor should we make a fetish of equality. We are equal only in the
sense that each of us is a soul, and should not be a tool for another
person; but we are obviously unequal in physical or mental ability. The
best economic system is one in which superior ability is stimulated to
develop itself, and is left relatively free to transmute new ideas into
productive realities. Property should be the private possession of the
family, for without that distinguishing reward superior ability would
not train or exert itself.</p>
<p>For the purpose of civilization — of turning savages into citizens —
religion is an ideal instrument, for it relates the individual to the
whole.</p>
<p>654</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>Since religion is an integrating factor in the state, implanting a
sense of unity in the depth of men’s minds, the state should even
require all its citizens to</p>
<p>The churches should be separate from the state, but should look upon
the state as “a consummate worship,” in which the religious goal of the
unifica - tion of the individual with the totality is as nearly effected
as is possible on earth. 56</p>
<p>The state, t hen, is man’s highest achievement. It is the organ of
the com - munity for the protection and development of the people. It
has the difficult task of reconciling social order with the natural
individualism of men and the jealous conflicts of internal groups. Law
is the freedom of civilized man, for it frees him from many injustices
and perils in return for his agreement not to inflict them upon other
citizens. “The state is the actuality of con - crete freedom.” 57 To so
transform chaos into orderly lib erty, the state must have authority
and, sometimes, must use force; police will be necessary, and, in
crisis, conscription too; but if the state is well managed it can be
called the organization of reason. In this sense we may say of the
state, as of the universe, that “the rational is real, and the real is
rational.” It is not utopic, but utopia is unreal.</p>
<p>Was this an idealization of the Prussian state of 1820? Not quite.
Unlike that regime, it assumed the full success of Stein’s and
Hardenberg’s r eforms. It called for a limited monarchy, constitutional
government, freedom of worship, and the emancipation of the Jews. It
condemned despotism, which it defined as “any state of affairs where law
has disappeared, and when the particular will as such, whether of a
monarch or a mob (ochlocracy), counts as law or takes the place of law;
while it is precisely in legal, constitutional government that
sovereignty is to be found as the moment of ideality.” 58 Hegel rejected
democracy outright: the ordinary citizen is ill-equipped to choose
competent rulers, or to determine national policy. The philosopher
accepted the French revolutionary Constitution of 1791, which called for
a constitutional monarchy, in which the people voted for a national
assem- bly, but not for a ruler. An elective monarchy “is the worst of
all institu - tions.” 59 So Hegel recommended a government composed of a
bicameral legislature elected by property owners; an executive and
administrative cabi- net of ministers; and an hereditary monarch having
“the will with the power of ultimate decision.” 60 “The development of
the state to constitutional mon - archy is the achievement of the modem
world.” 61</p>
<p>It would be unfair to call this philosophy reactionary. It was quite
in line with the reasoned conservatism of Montaigne and Voltaire, Burke
and Macaulay, Benjamin Constant advising Napoleon, and Tocqueville after
studying the French and American governments. It left some room for
indi- vidual freedom of thought, and for religious toleration. We must
view it in its context in place and time: we must imagine ourselves in
the maelstrom of post-Napoleonic Europe — with its bankruptcy and
depression, and its reac-</p>

<p>ionary governments trying to restore the Ancien Regime — to
understand the reaction of a thinker too advanced in years to be
adventurous in thought, too comfortably established to relish the
ecstasy of revolution, or risk the replacement of an old government with
inexperienced theorists or mob rule. It was the hasty preface, not the
carefully organized and considered book, that was unworthy of a
philosopher. The old man was frightened by Fries’s eloquence and its
excited reception; he called for the police; and he was not sorry “that
governments have at last directed their attention to this kind of
philosophy.” 62 It is not for age to venture but to preserve.</p>

<li>History</li>
</ol>
<p>Hegel’s students must have loved him, for after his death they pored
over his notes, added their own records of his lectures, arranged the
result in some reasonable order, and issued it over his name. So
appeared four posthu- mous books: Aesthetics, Philosophy of Religion,
Philosophy of History, and History of Philosophy. They are the most
intelligible of his works, per- haps because least obscured by the
complexity of his thought and style.</p>
<p>“The only thought which philosophy brings with it to the
contemplation of history is the simple concept of Reason: that Reason
[the logic and law of events] is the Sovereign of the World; that
therefore the history of the world presents us a rational process.” 03
Here too the actual was rational— it was the only logical and necessary
result of its antecedents. Hegel often speaks of his Sovereign Reason in
religious terms, but he defines it by mating Spinoza and Newton: “Reason
is the substance of the universe, viz., that by which and in which all
reality has its being and subsistence”; and on the other hand it is “the
Infinite Energy of the Universe”; i.e., the categories of the Logik are
the basic means of understanding the operative relations which
constitute “the infinite complex of things, their entire Essence and
Truth.” 64</p>
<p>If the operations of history are an expression of Reason — of the
laws in- herent in the nature of things — there must be some method in
the apparent whimsy of events. Hegel sees method in both the process and
the result. The process of reason in history, as in logic, is
dialectical: each stage or condition (thesis) contains contradictions
(antithesis) which struggle to compose a synthesis. So despotism tried
to suppress the human hunger for freedom; the hunger broke out in
revolt; their synthesis was constitutional monarchy. Is there, then, a
general or total design behind the course of history? No, if this means
a conscious supreme power guiding all causes and effects to a determined
goal; yes, insofar as the widening stream of events, as a civiliza- tion
advances, is moved by the total of Geist or Mind to bring man closer and
closer to his absorbing goal, which is freedom through reason. Not free-
dom from law — though that conceivably might come if intelligence should
reach its full growth — but freedom through law; so the evolution of the
state can be a boon to liberty. This progress toward freedom is not
continuous, for in the dialectic of history there are contradictions to
be resolved, oppo- sitions to be transformed into fusion, centrifugal
diversities to be drawn</p>
<p>6 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>oward a unifying center by the character of the age or the work of
excep- tional men.</p>
<p>These two forces — the time and the genius — are the engineers of
history, and when they work together they are irresistible. Hegel —
inspiring Carlyle — believed in heroes and hero worship. Geniuses are
not necessarily virtuous, though it is a mistake to think that they are
selfish individualists; Napoleon was no mere conqueror for the sake of
conquest; he was, consciously or not, the agent of Europe’s greater need
for unity and consistent laws. But the genius is helpless unless,
consciously or not, he embodies and serves the Zeitgeist, the Spirit of
the Times. “Such individuals had insight into the re - quirements of the
time — 1 what was ripe for development. This was the very truth for
their age, for their world; the species next in order, so to speak, and
which was already formed in the womb of time.” 65 If the genius is borne
on such a tide (like Galileo, Franklin, or James Watt) he will be a
force for growth, even if he brings misery for an entire generation. The
genius is not meant to peddle happiness. “The history of the world is
not the theater of happiness. Periods of happiness are the blank pages
in it, for they are periods of harmony, when the antithesis is in
abeyance,” 66 and history sleeps.</p>
<p>The chief obstacle to interpreting history as progress is the fact
that civi- lizations can die, or entirely disappear. But Hegel was not
the man to let such incidents disrupt his dialectic. He divided man’s
past (as aforesaid) into three periods, the Oriental, the Greco-Roman,
and the Christian, and saw some progress in their succession: the Orient
gave freedom to one man as absolute ruler; classical antiquity gave
freedom to a caste using slaves; the Christian world, giving each person
a soul, sought to free all. It encountered resistance in the traffic in
slaves, but this conflict was resolved in the French Revolution. At this
point (about 1822) Hegel broke out into a surprising paean to that
upheaval, or to its first two years.</p>
<p>The political condition of France [had] presented nothing but a
confused mass of privileges, altogether contravening Thought and Reason,
with the greatest corruption of morals and spirit. The change was
necessarily violent, because the work of transformation was not
undertaken by the government [was opposed by the court, the clergy, and
the nobility],… The idea of Right asserted its authority, and the old
framework of injustice could offer no resistance to its onslaught. It
was a glorious mental dawn. All thinking beings shared in the
jubilation. A spiritual enthusiasm filled the world. 67</p>
<p>Mob violence darkened that dawn, but after the blood was washed away
substantial progress remained; and Hegel was still cosmopolitan enough
to recognize that the French Revolution had brought substantial benefits
to much of Germany — the Code Napoleon, the abolition of feudal
privileges, the enlargement of freedom, the spread of property
ownership…. 68 All in all, Hegel’s analysis of the French Revolution, in
the final pages of The Philosophy of History, proves that the frightened
conservative had not quite repudiated the ideals of his youth.</p>
<p>He considered it a main fault of the Revolution that it had made an
enemy of religion. “Religion is Reason’s highest and most rational work.
It is absurd</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>6 57</p>
<p>o maintain that priests have thought up religion for the people as a
fraud for their own benefit.” 69 Consequently it is “folly to pretend to
invent and carry out political constitutions independently of religion.”
70 “Religion is the sphere in which the nation gives itself the
definition of that which it regards as the True…. The concept of God,
therefore, constitutes the gen- eral basis of a people’s character.”
71</p>
<p>Conversely, “the shape which the perfect embodiment of Spirit assumes
[is] th e state.” 72 Fully developed, the state becomes “the basis and
center of the other concrete elements of the life of a people — of Art,
Law, Morals, Re- ligion, Science.” 73 Supported and justified by
religion, the state becomes di - vine.</p>
<p>Aspiring to produce a system of philosophy unified by one basic
formula of explanation, Hegel applied his dialectic to one field after
another. To his philosophy of history his students, after his death,
added his History of Philosophy. The famous ancient systems of universal
analysis, in this view, followed a sequence basically corresponding to
the evolution of the cate- gories in the Logik. Parmenides stressed
Being and stability; Heracleitus stressed Becoming, development, change.
Democritus saw objective matter, Plato saw subjective idea; Aristotle
provided the synthesis. Each system, like each category and each
generation, enclosed — and added to — its predecessors, so that a full
understanding of the last system would comprehend them all. “What each
generation has brought forward as knowledge and spiritual cre - ation,
the next generation inherits. This inheritance constitutes its soul, its
spiritual substance.” 74 Since Hegel’s philosoph y was the latest in the
great chain of philosophical imaginations, it included (in its author’s
view) all the basic ideas and values of all major preceding systems, and
was their historical and theoretical culmination. 75</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Death and Return</li>
</ol>
<p>His time, for a time, almost took him at his own estimate. His
classes grew despite his dour temper and abstruse style; prominent men —
Cousin and Michelet from France, Heiberg from Denmark — came from afar
to see him balance the universe on his categories. He was honored in
Paris in 1827, and by old Goethe on the way home. In 1830 his
certainties were shaken by the spread of radical movements and
revolutionary agitation; he denounced them, and in 1831 he issued across
the waters an appeal for the defeat of the Reform Bill that marked the
rise of democracy in England. He rephrased his philosophy more and more
in terms acceptable to Protestant divines.</p>
<p>Still only sixty-one, and apparently in full vigor, he fell victim to
a cholera epidemic, and died in Berlin, November 14, 1831. He was
buried, as he had wished, beside the grave of Fichte. As if in testimony
to his cautious ob- scurity, his students divided into antipodal groups:
the “Hegelian Right,” led by Johann Erdmann, Kuno Fischer, and Karl
Rosenkranz; and the “Hegelian Left”— Ludwig Feuerbach, David Strauss,
Bruno Bauer, and Karl Marx. The “Right” excelled in scholarship, but
declined as “Higher Criti -</p>
<p>6 5 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>cism” of the Bible grew; the “Left” expanded in attacks upon
religious and political orthodoxy. The “Left” interpreted Hegel’s
identification of God and Reason to mean that nature, man, and history
are subject to invariable and impersonal laws. Feuerbac h quoted Hegel
as saying, “Man knows about God only insofar as God knows about himself
within man”; 76 i.e., the Rea - son of the universe becomes conscious
only in man; only man can think of cosmic laws. Marx, who knew Hegel
chiefly through the master’ s writings, transformed the dialectical
movement of the categories into the economic interpretation of history,
in which the class war superseded the Heroes as a main agent of
progress; and socialism became the Marxian synthesis of capitalism and
its internal contradictions.</p>
<p>Hegel’s reputation faded for a time as Schopenhauer’s sarcastic
passions swept the philosophic board. Philosophers of history were lost
in the advance of historical scholarship. Hegelianism seemed dead in
Germany, but it had risen to new life in Great Britain with John and
Edward Caird, T. H.</p>
<p>Green, J. M. E. McTaggart, and Bernard Bosanquet. When it died in
Eng- land it rose again in the United States. Perhaps the echoes of
Hegel’s wor - ship of the state helped to pave the way for Bismarck and
Hitler. Meanwhile Soren Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and
Jean-Paul Sartre found in the Phiinomenologie des Geistes a virile note
of human competi- tion in a world apparently shorn of divine guidance,
and Hegel became the godfather of Existentialism.</p>
<p>All in all, this age of Goethe, Beethoven, and Hegel was one of the
high- water points in the history of Germany. It had reached or neared
such peaks before, as in the Renaissance and the Reformation; but the
Thirty Y ears’ War had shattered the economic and intellectual life of
the people, and had darkened the soul of Germany almost to despair
through a hundred years. Slowly the native vigor of her stock, the stoic
patience of her women, the skill of her craftsmen, the enterprise of her
merchants, and the power and depth of her music prepared her to receive
and transform to her own taste and character such foreign influences as
England’s Shakespeare and her Ro - mantic poets, the Enlightenment and
Revolution of France. She moderated Voltaire into Goethe and Wieland,
Rousseau into Schiller and Richter; she answered Napoleon with a War of
Liberation, and cleared the way for the manifold achievements of her
people in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Gvilization.is a collaboration as well as a rivalry; therefore it is
good that each nation has its own culture, government, economy, dress,
and songs. It has taken many diverse forms of organization and
expression to make the European spirit so subtle and diverse, and to
make the Europe of today an endless fascination and an inexhaustible
heritage.</p>
