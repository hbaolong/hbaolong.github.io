<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>Christianity in Conflict</p>
<p>529-1085</p>
<p>I. ST. BENEDICT: C . 480-543</p>
<p>T HE year 529, which saw the closing of the Athenian schools of phi-
losophy, saw also the opening of Monte Cassino, the most famous mon-
astery in Latin Christendom. Its founder, Benedict of Nursia, was born
at Spoleto, apparently of the dying Roman aristocracy. Sent to Rome for
an education, he was scandalized by the sexual license there, or, some
say, he loved and lost. 1 At the age of fifteen he fled to a remote spot
five miles from Subiaco, in the Sabine hills; made his cell in a cave at
the foot of a precipice; and lived there for some years as a solitary
monk. The Dialogues of Pope Gregory I tell how Benedict fought valiantly
to forget the woman</p>
<p>the memory of whom the wicked spirit put into his mind, and by that
memory so mightily inflamed with concupiscence the soul of God’s</p>
<p>servant . . . that, almost overcome with pleasure, he was of a mind
to forsake the wilderness. But suddenly, assisted by God’s grace, he
came to himself; and seeing many thick briers and nettle bushes
growing</p>
<p>hard by, off he cast his apparel, and threw himself into the midst
of</p>
<p>them, and there wallowed so long that when he rose up all his flesh
was pitifully torn; and so by the wounds of his body he cured the</p>
<p>wounds of his soul. 2</p>
<p>After he had lived there for some years, and his steadfastness had
won him fame, he was importuned by the monks of a nearby monastery to be
their abbot. He warned them that his rule would be severe; they
persisted, and he went with them; after a few months of his stern
regimen they put poison in his wine. He resumed his solitary life; but
young devotees came to live near him and solicit his guidance; fathers
brought their sons, even from Rome, to be taught by him; by 520 twelve
little monasteries, each with twelve monks, had risen round his cave.
When of even these monks many found his rule too strict, he removed with
the most ardent of his followers to Monte Cassino, a hill 1715 feet
above sea level, overlooking the ancient town of Casinum, forty miles
northwest of Capua. There he demolished a pagan temple, founded ( c
.</p>
<ol start="529" type="1">
<li>a monastery, and formulated that Benedictine Rule which was to guide
most monasteries in the West.</li>
</ol>
<p>5 l l</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>5 l8</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>The monks of Italy and France had erred in imitating the solitary
asceti- cism of the East; both the climate and the active spirit of
Western Europe made such a regimen discouragingly difficult, and led to
many relapses. Benedict did not criticize the anchorites, nor condemn
asceticism, but he thought it wiser to make asceticism communal, not
individual; there should be no show or rivalry in it; at every step it
was to be under an abbot’s control, and stop short of injury to health
or mind.</p>
<p>Hitherto, in the West, no vows had been demanded of those who entered
the monastic life. Benedict felt that the aspirant should serve a
novitiate, and learn by experience the austerities to be required of
him; only after such a trial might he take the vows. Then, if he still
wished, he was to pledge him- self, in writing, to “the perpetuity of
his stay, the ref ormation of his manners, and obedience”; and this vow,
signed and witnessed, was to be laid upon the altar by the novice
himself in a solemn ritual. Thereafter the monk must not leave the
monastery without the abbot’s permission. The abbot was to be chosen by
the monks, and was to consult them on all matters of importance; but the
final decision was to rest with him, and they were to obey him in
silence and humility. They were to speak only when necessary; they were
not to jest or laugh loudly; they were to walk with their eyes on the
ground. They were to own nothing, “neither a book, nor tablets, nor a
pen— nothing</p>
<p>at all All things shall be held in common .” 3 Conditions of previous
wealth</p>
<p>or slavery were to be ignored and forgotten. The abbot</p>
<p>shall make no distinction of persons in the monastery. … A freeborn
man shall not be preferred to one comihg from servitude, unless there be
some other and reasonable cause. For whether we are bond or free, we are
all one in Christ. . . . God is no respecter of persons . 4</p>
<p>Alms and hospitality were to be given within the means of the
monastery, to all who asked for it. “All guests who come shall be
received as though they were Christ.” 5</p>
<p>Every monk must work-in the fields or shops of the monastery, in the
kitchen, about the house, copying manuscripts. . . . Nothing was to be
eaten till noon, and in Lent not till sundown. From mid-September to
Easter there was to be but one meal a day; in the summer months, two,
for then the days were long. Wine was allowed, but no flesh of any
four-footed beast. Work or sleep was to be frequently interrupted with
communal prayer. Influenced by Eastern exemplars, Benedict divided the
day into “canonical hours”— hours of prayer as established by canon or
rule. The monks were to rise at two a.m., repair to the chapel, and
recite or sing “noctums”— scriptural readings, prayers, and psalms; at
dawn they gathered for “matins” or “lauds”; at six for “prime”— the
first hour; at nine for “tierce”— the third; at noon for “sext”— the
sixth; at three for “none”— the ninth; at sunset for ves- pers — the
evening hour; at bedtime for “compline”— the completion. Bedtime</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 5 1 9</p>
<p>was nightfall; the monks almost dispensed with artificial light. They
slept in their clothes, and seldom bathed. 6</p>
<p>To these specific regulations Benedict added some, general counsels
of Christian perfection:</p>
<p>1 . In the first place, to love the Lord God with the whole
heart,</p>
<p>the whole soul, the whole strength. 2. Then one’s neighbor as
oneself.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Then not to kill . . . nor commit adultery . . . nor steal . . . nor
covet . . . nor bear false witness. … 8. To honor all men. … 1 1. To
chasten</li>
</ol>
<p>the body. … 13. To love fasting. 14. To relieve the poor. 15. To</p>
<p>clothe the naked. 16. To visit the sick. … 30. Not to do injuries,
and</p>
<p>to bear them patiently. … 31. To love one’s enemies. … 53. Not to</p>
<p>be fond of much talking. … 61. Not to desire to be called a saint . .
.</p>
<p>but to be one. … 71. After a disagreement to be reconciled before</p>
<p>the going down of the sun. 72. And never to despair of the mercy</p>
<p>of God. 7</p>
<p>In an age of war and chaos, of doubt and wandering, the Benedictine
mon- astery was a healing refuge. It took dispossessed or ruined
peasants, students longing for some quiet retreat, men weary of the
strife and tumult of the world, and said to them: “Give up your pride
and freedom, and find here security and peace.” No wonder a hundred
similar Benedictine monasteries rose throughout Europe, each independent
of the rest, all subject only to the pope, serving as communistic isles
in a raging individualistic sea. The Bene- dictine Rule and order proved
to be among the most enduring creations of medieval man. Monte Cassino
itself is a symbol of that permanence. Lombard barbarians sacked it in
589; the Lombards retired; the monks returned. The Saracens destroyed it
in 884; the monks rebuilt it; earthquake ruined it in 1349; the monks
restored it; French soldiery pillaged it in 1799; the shells and bombs
of the Second World War leveled it to the ground in 1944. Today (1948)
the monks of St. Benedict, with their own hands, are building it once
more. Succtsa virescit : cut down, it blooms again.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>GREGORY THE GREAT: 540?-604</li>
</ol>
<p>While Benedict and his monks peacefully worked and prayed at Monte
Cassino, the Gothic War ( 5 36-5 3 ) passed up and down Italy like a
withering flame, leaving disorder and poverty in its wake. Urban economy
was in chaos. Political institutions lay in ruins; in Rome no secular
authority sur- vived except that of imperial legates weakly supported by
unpaid and dis- tant troops. In this collapse of worldly powers the
survival of ecclesiastical organization appeared even to the emperors as
the salvation of the state. In 554 Justinian promulgated a decree
requiring that “fit and proper persons, able to administer the local
government, be chosen as governors of the prov-</p>
<p>520 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>inces by the bishops and chief persons of ea ch province.” 8 But
Justinian’s corpse was hardly cold when the Lombard invasion (568)
subjected north- ern Italy again to barbarism and Arianism, and
threatened the whole struc- ture and leadership of the Church in Italy.
The crisis called forth a man, and history once more testified to the
influence of genius.</p>
<p>Gregory was born at Rome three years before Benedict’s death. He came
of an ancient senatorial family, and his youth was spent in a handsome
palace on the Caelian Hill. On the death of his father he fell heir to a
large fortune. He rose rapidly in the or do honorum, or sequence of
political plums; at thirty-three he was prefect — as we should say,
mayor — of Rome. But he had no taste for politics. Having finished his
year of office, and apparently con- vinced by the condition of Italy
that the ever-heralded end of the world was at hand, 9 he used the
greater part of his fortune to found seven monasteries, distributed the
rest in alms to the poor, laid aside all vestiges of his rank, turned
his palace into the monastery of St. Andrew, and became its first monk.
He subjected himself to extreme asceticism, lived for the most part on
raw vegetables and fruits, and fasted so often that when Holy Saturday
came, on which fasting was pre-eminently enjoined, it seemed that
another day of abstinence would kill him. Yet the three years that he
spent in the monastery were always recalled by him as the happiest of
his life.</p>
<p>Out of this peace he was drawn to serve Pope Benedict I as “seventh
dea - con”; and in 579 he was sent by Pope Pelagius II as ambassador to
the imperial court at Constantinople. Amid the wiles of diplomacy and
the pomp of pal- aces he continued to live like a monk in habit, diet,
and prayer; 10 nevertheless he gained some helpful experience of the
world and its chicanery. In 586 he was recalled to Rome, and became
Abbot of St. Andrew’s. In 590 a terrible bubonic plague decimated the
population of Rome; Pelagius himself was a victim; and at once the
clergy and people of the city chose Gregory to suc- ceed him. Gregory
was loath to leave his monastery, and wrote to the Greek emperor asking
him to refuse confirmation of the election; the city prefect intercepted
the letter; and as Gregory was preparing flight he was seized and
brought by force to St. Peter’s, and there was consecrated Pope; or so
we are told by another Gregory. 11</p>
<p>He was now fifty, and already bald, with large head, dark complexion,
aquiline nose, sparse and tawny beard; a man of strong feeling and
gentle speech, of imperial purposes and simple sentiment. Austerities
and responsi- bilities had ruined his health; he suffered from
indigestion, slow fever, and gout. In the papal palace he lived as he
had in the monastery — dressed in a monk’s coarse robe , eating the
cheapest foods, sharing a common life with the monks and priests who
aided him. 12 Usually absorbed in problems of re- ligion and the state,
he could unbend into words and deeds of paternal affec- tion. A
wandering minstrel appeared at the gate of the palace with organ and
monkey; Gregory bade the man enter, and gave him food and drink. 13
In-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 521</p>
<p>stead of spending the revenues of the Church in building new
edifices, he used them in charity, in gifts to religious institutions
throughout Christen- dom, and in redeeming captives of war. To every
poor family in Rome he distributed monthly a portion of corn, wine,
cheese, vegetables, oil, fish, meat, clothing, and money; and every day
his agents brought cooked pro- visions to the sick or infirm. His
letters, stern to negligent ecclesiastics or to political potentates,
are jewels of sympathy to persons in distress: to a peasant exploited on
Church lands, to a slave girl wishing to take the veil, to a noble lady
worried about her sins. In his conception the priest was literally a
pastor, a shepherd caring for his flock, and the good Pope had every
right to compose his Liber pastor alls curae (590) , a manual of advice
to bishops, which became a Christian classic. Though always ailing and
prematurely old, he spent him- self in ecclesiastical administration,
papal politics, agricultural management, military strategy, theological
treatises, mystic ecstasies, and a solicitous con- cern with a thousan d
details of human life. He chastened’ the pride of his of - fice with the
humility of his creed; he called himself, in the first of his extant
epistles, servus servorum Dei , “servant of the servants of God”; and
the greatest popes have accepted the noble phrase.</p>
<p>His administration of the Church was marked by economic wisdom and
stern reform. He struggled to suppress simony and concubinage in the
clergy. He restored discipline in the Latin monasteries, and regulated
their relations with the secular clergy and the pope. He improved the
canon of the Mass, and perhaps contributed to the development of
“Gregorian” chant. He checked exploitation on the papal estates,
advanced money to tenant farmers, and charged no interest. But he
collected due revenues promptly, slyly offered rent reductions to
converted Jews, and received, for the Church, legacies of land from
barons frightened by his sermons on the approaching end of the world.
14</p>
<p>Meanwhile he met the ablest rulers of his day in political duels, won
often, sometimes lost, but in the end left the power and prestige of the
papacy, and the “Patrimony of Peter” (i.e., the Papal States in central
Italy) immensely extended and enhanced. He formally acknowledged, but in
practice largely ignored, the sovereignty of the Eastern emperor. When
the duke of Spoleto, at war with the Imperial exarch of Ravenna,
threatened Rome, Gregory signed a peace with the duke without consulting
the exarch or the emperor. When the Lombards besieged Rome Gregory
shared in organizing defense.</p>
<p>He mourned every minute given to earthly concerns, and apologized to
his congregation for his inability to preach comforting sermons amid the
worldly cares that troubled his mind. In the few years of peace allowed
him he turned happily to the task of spreading the Gospel through
Europe. He brought the rebellious bishops of Lombardy to submission,
restored ortho- dox Catholicism in Africa, received the conversion of
Arian Spain, and won England with forty monks. While Abbot o f
St. Andrew’s he had seen some</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>English captives exposed for sale in a slave market at Rome; he was
struck, says the patriotic Bede, by their</p>
<p>white skin and comely countenance and hair of excellent beauty. And
beholding them awhile he demanded, as they say, out of what region or
land they had been brought. And it was answered that they came from
Britain, where such was the appearance of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Again, he asked whether the people of that island were Christian men
. . . and answer was made that they were paynims. Then this good</p>
<p>man . . . “alas,” quoth he, “it is a piteous case that the author of
dark - ness possesseth such bright beautied people, and that men of
such</p>
<p>gracious outward sheen do bea r a mind void of inward grace.” Again,
therefore, he enquired what was the name of that people. Answer was
given that they were called Angles. Whereon he said, “Well are they so
called, for they have an angel’s face, and it is meet that such men were
i nheritors with the angels in heaven.” 15</p>
<p>The story — too pretty to be credible — goes on to say that Gregory
asked and received of Pope Pelagius II permission to lead some
missionaries to England; that Gregory started out, but was halted by a
locust dropping upon the page of Scripture that he was reading; “
locustal ” he cried; “that means loco sta”— stay in your place. 16
Impressed soon afterward into the papacy, he did not forget England. In
596 he sent thither a mission under Augustine, Prior of St . Andrew’s.
Arrived in Gaul, the monks were turned back by Frank stories of Saxon
savagery; those “angels,” they were informed, “were wild beasts who
preferred killing to eating, thirsted for human blood, and liked
Christian blood best of all. Augustine returned to Rome with these
reports, but Gregory reproved and encouraged him, and sent him back to
accomplish peaceably in two years what Rome had transiently achieved by
ninety years of war.</p>
<p>Gregory was not a philosopher-theologian like the great Augustine,
nor a master of style like the brilliant Jerome; but his writings so
deeply influenced and expressed the medieval mind that beside him
Augustine and Jerome seem classical. He left behind him books of popular
theology so rich in nonsense that one wonders whether the great
administrator believed what he wrote, or merely wrote what he thought it
well for simple and sinful souls to be- lieve. His biography of Benedict
is the most pleasing of these books — a charming idyl of reverence, with
no pretense to critical sifting of legend from fact. His 800 letters are
his best literary legacy; here this varied man reveals himself in a
hundred phases, and gives unconsciously an intimate pic- ture of his
mind and times. His Dialogues were loved by the people because they
offered as history the most amazing tales of the visions, prophecies,
and miracles of Italy’s holy men. Here the reader learned of massive
boulders moved by prayer, of a saint who could make himself invisible,
of poisons rendered harmless by the sign of the cross, of provisions
miraculously sup-</p>

<p>plied and increased, of the sick made whole and the dead restored to
life. The power of relics ran through these dialogues, but none more
marvelous than the chains that were believed to have bound Peter and
Paul; Gregory cher- ished these with adoration; he sent filings from
them as presents to his friends; and with one such offering he wrote to
a sufferer from ailing eyesight: “Let</p>
<p>His deeper venture into theology took the form of the Magna moraYia —
a six- volume commentary on the Book of Job. He takes the drama as
literal history in every line; but also he seeks in every line an
allegorical or sym- bolical significance, and ends by finding in Job the
full Augustinian theology. The Bible is in every sense the word of God;
it is a complete system of wis- dom and beauty in itself; and no man
should waste his time and debase his morals by reading the pagan
classics. However, the Bible is occasionally obscure, and is often
couched in popular or pictorial language; it needs care- ful
interpretation by trained minds; and the Church, as custodian of sacred
tradition, is the only proper interpreter. Individual reason is a weak
and di- visive instrument, not designed to deal with supersensual
realities; and “when</p>
<p>Perhaps Gr egory’s theology reflected his health as well as the
frightening</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>5H</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>chaos of his time. “In eleven months,” he wrote in 599, “I have
rarely been able to leave my bed. I am so tormented with gout and
painful anxieties that . . . every day I look for the relief of death.”
And in 600: “For nearly two years I have been confined to my couch, so
afflicted with pain that even on festivals I can hardly get up for three
hours to celebrate Mass. I am daily at the point of death, and daily
being driven back from it.” And in 601 : “It is long since I have been
able to leave my couch. I look longingly for death.” 22 It came in
604.</p>
<p>He dominated the end of the sixth century as Justinian had dominated
its beginning; and his effect on religion was exceeded in this epoch
only by that of Mohammed. He was not a learned man, nor a profound
theologian; but because of his simplicity he influenced the people more
deeply than the Augustine whose lead he followed with engaging humility.
In mind he was the first completely medieval man. 23 While his hand
managed a scattered em- pire, his thought dwelt on the corruption of
human nature, the temptations of ubiquitous devils, and the approaching
end of the world. He preached with po wer that religion of terror which
was to darken men’s minds for cen - turies; he accepted all the miracles
of popular legend, all the magical efficacy of relics, images, and
formulas; he lived in a world haunted with angels, demons, wizards, and
ghosts. All sense of a rational order in the universe had departed from
him; it was a world in which science was impossible, and only a fearful
faith remained. The next seven centuries would accept this the- ology;
the great Scholastics would toil to give it the form of reason; it would
constitute the tragic background of The Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>But this same man, superstitious and credulous, physically shattered
with a terrified piety, was in will and action a Roman of the ancient
cast, tenacious of purpose, stern of judgment, prudent and practical, in
love with discipline and law. He gave a law to monasticism, as Benedict
had given it a rule; he built the temporal power of the papacy, freed it
from imperial domination, and administered it with such wisdom and
integrity that men would look to the papacy as a rock of refuge through
tempestuous centuries. His grateful successors canonized him, and an
admiring posterity called him Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>His early successors found it hard to live up to his height of virtue
or power. For the most part they accepted domination by exarch or
emperor, and were repeatedly humiliated in their efforts to resist. The
Emperor Heraclius, anxious to unify his rescued realm, sought to
reconcile the Monophysite East — which held that there was but one
nature in Christ — with the orthodox West, which distinguished two; his
manifesto, Ekthesis (638), proposed an agreement through the doctrine of
monothelism — that there was but one will in Christ. Pope Ho-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 525</p>
<p>norius I agreed, adding that the question of one or two wills was “a
point which I leave to grammarians as a matter of very little
importance”; 24 but the theolo - gians of the West denounced his
compliance. When the Emperor Constans II issued a proclamation (648)
favoring monothelism, Pope Martin I rejected it. Constans ordered the
exarch of Ravenna to arrest him and bring him to Con- stantinople;
refusing to yield, the Pope was banished to the Crimea, where he died
(655). The Sixth Ecumenical Council, meeting at Constantinople in 680,
repudiated monothelism, and condemned Pope Honorius, past mortem , as “a
favorer of heretics.” 25 The Eastern Church, chastened by the loss of
Monophy - site Syria and Egypt to the Moslems, concurred in the
decision, and theological peace hovered for a moment over East and
West.</p>
<p>But the repeated humiliations of the papacy by the Eastern emperors,
the weakening of Byzantium by Moslem expansion in Asia, Africa, and
Spain, by Moslem control of the Mediterranean, and by the inability of
Constantinople or Ravenna to protect the papal estates in Italy from
Lombard assaults, drove the popes to turn from the declining Empire and
seek aid from the rising Franks. Pope Stephen II (752-7), fearful that a
Lombard capture of Rome would reduce the papacy to a local bishopric
dominated by Lombard kings, appealed to the Emperor Constantine V; no
help came thence; and the Pope, in a move fraught with political
consequences, turned to the Franks. Pepin the Short came, subdued the
Lombards, and enriched the papacy with the “Donation of Pepin,” giving
it all central Italy (756) ; so was established the temporal power of
the popes. This brilliant papal diplomacy culminated in the coronation
of Charlemagne by Leo III (800); thereafter no man could be an accepted
emperor in the West without anointment by a pope. The harassed bishopric
of Gregory I had become one of the greatest powers in Europe. When
Charlemagne died (814), the domination of the Church by the Frank state
was reversed; step by step the clergy of France subordinated its kings;
and while the empire of Charlemagne collapsed, the au- thority and
influence of the Church increased.</p>
<p>At first it was the episcopacy that profited most from the weakness
and quar- rels of the French and German kings. In Germany the
archbishops, allied with the kings, enjoyed over property, bishops, and
priests a feudal power that paid only lip service to the popes.
Apparently it was the resentment of the German bishops, irked by this
archiepiscopal autocracy, that generated the “False Decre - tals”; this
collection, which would later fortify the papacy, aimed first of all
to</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>as having received, in the “Donation of Constantine,” full secular as
well as re - ligious authority over all western Europe; consequently the
“Donation of Pepin” was but a halting restoration of stolen property;
and the repudiation of Byzantine suzerainty by the pope in crowning
Charlemagne appeared as the long-delayed reassertion of a right derived
from the founder of the Eastern Empire himself. Unfortunately, many of
the unauthentic documents quoted Scripture in the translation of
St. Jerome, who was born twenty-six years after the death of Melchiades.
The forgery would have been evident to any good scholar, but scholarship
was at low ebb in the ninth and tenth centuries. The fact that most of
the claims ascribed by the Decretals to the early bishops of Rome had
been made by one or another of the later pontiffs disarmed criticism;
and for eight centuries the popes assumed the authenticity of these
documents, and used them to prop their policies.*</p>
<p>By a happy coincidence the “False Decretals” appeared shortly before
the election of one of the most commanding figures in papal history.
Nicholas I (858-67) had received an exceptionally thorough education in
the law and tra- ditions of the Church, and had been apprenticed to his
high office by being a favored aide of several popes. He equaled the
great Gregorys (I and VII) in strength of will, and surpassed them in
the extent and success of his claims. Start- ing from premises then
accepted by all Christians — that the Son of God had founded the Church
by making Peter her first head, and that the bishops of Rome inherited
their power from Peter in direct line — Nicholas reasonably concluded
that the po pe, as God’s representative on earth, should enjoy a
suzerain authority over all Christians — rulers as well as subjects — at
least in matters of faith and morals. Nicholas eloquently expounded this
simple argument, and no one in Latin Christendom dared contradict it.
Kings and archbishops could only hope that he would not take it too
seriously.</p>
<p>They were disappointed. When Lothaire II, King of Lorraine, wished to
divorce his Queen Theutberga and marry his mistress Waldrada, the chief
prel- ates of his kingdom granted his wish (862). Theutberga appealed to
Nicholas, who sent legates to Metz to examine the matter; Lothaire
bribed the legates to confirm the divorce; the archbishops of Trier and
Cologne brought this decision to the Pope; Nicholas discovered the
fraud, excommunicated the archbishops, and ordered Lothaire to dismiss
his mistress and take back his wife. Lothaire re- fused, and marched
with an army against Rome. Nicholas remained for forty- eight hours in
St. Peter’s in fasting and praye r; Lothaire lost courage, and sub-
mitted to the Pope’s commands.</p>
<p>Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims, and the greatest prelate in Latin
Europe after the Pope himself, dismissed a bishop, Ratherad, who
appealed to Nicholas (863). Having reviewed the case, Nicholas ordered
Ratherad reinstated; when Hincmar hesitated, the Pope threatened to lay
an interdict — a suspension of all church serv- ices — upon his
province; Hincmar fumed and yielded. To kings as well as prelates
Nicholas wrote as one having supreme authority, and only Photius of
Constanti- nople dared gainsay him. In nearly every case later
developments showed the</p>

<p>Pope to have been on the side of justice; and his stern defense of
morality was a lamp and tower in a decadent age. When he died, the power
of the papacy was acknowledged more widely than ever before.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GREEK CHURCH: 566-898</li>
</ol>
<p>The patriarchs of the Eastern Church could not admit the overriding
jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome for a simple reason: they had long
since been subordinated to the Greek emperors, and these would not till
87 1 aban- don their claim to sovereignty over Rome and its popes. The
patriarchs occasionally criticized, disobeyed, even denounced, the
emperors; but they were appointed and deposed by the emperors, who
called ecclesiastical coun- cils, regulated church affairs by state law,
and published their theological opinions and directives to the
ecclesiastical world. The only checks on the religious autocracy of the
emperor in Eastern Christendom were the power of the monks, the tongue
of the patriarch, and the vow taken by the emperor, at his coronation by
the patriarch, that he would introduce no novelty into the Church.</p>
<p>Constantinople — indeed all the Greek East — was now dotted with
monas- teries and nunneries in far greater number than in the West. The
monastic passion captured some of the Byzantine emperors themselves:
they lived like ascetics amid the luxury of the palace, heard Mass
daily, ate abstemiously, and bemoaned their sins as sedulously as they
committed them. The piety of em- perors and of the moribund rich
enlarged and multiplied the monasteries with gifts and legacies; men and
women of high rank, frightened by omens of death, sought admission to
monasteries, and brought with them an ingratiat- ing wealth that would
no longer be subject to taxation; others deeded some of their property
to a monastery, which then paid them an annuity. Many monasteries
claimed to possess relics of revered saints; people credited the monks
with control of the wonder-working power of these relics, and offered
their coins in the hope of making an unreasonable profit on their
investments. A minority of the monks disgraced their faith with
idleness, venery, faction, and greed; the majority were reconciled to
virtue and peace; altogether the monks enjoyed a popular veneration, a
material wealth, and even a political influence that no emperor could
ignore. Theodore (759-826), Abbot of the monastery of Studion in
Constantinople, was an exemplar of monastic piety and power. Dedicated
to the Church by his mother in his childhood, he ac- cepted the
Christian mood so thoroughly that in his mother’s last illness he
complimented her on her approaching death and glory. He drew up for his
monks a code of labor, prayer, chastity, and intellectual development
that could stand comparison with that of Benedict in the West. He
defended the use of religious images, and boldly denied, before the
Emperor Leo V, that</p>
<p>528 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>the secular power had any jurisdiction over ecclesiastical affairs.
Four times he was banished for this intransigeance; but from his exile
he continued to resist the Iconoclasts till his death.</p>
<p>Differences of language, liturgy, and doctrine during these centuries
drove Latin and Greek Christianity further and further apart, like a
biological spe- cies divided in space and diversified in time. Greek
liturgy, ecclesiastical vestments, vessels, and ornaments were more
complex, ornate, and artistically wrought than those of the West; the
Greek cross had equal arms; the Greeks prayed standing, the Latins
kneeling; the Greeks baptized by immersion, the Latins by aspersion;
marriage was forbidden to Latin, permitted to Greek, priests; Latin
priests shaved, Greek priests had contemplative beards. The Latin clergy
specialized in politics, the Greek in theology; heresy almost al- ways
rose in an East that had inherited the Greek passion for defining the
infinite. From the old Gnostic heresies of Bardesanes in Syria, and
perhaps from the westward movement of Manichean ideas, there arose in
Armenia, about 660, a sect of Paulicians that took its name from
St. Paul, rejected the Old Testament, the sacraments, the reverence paid
to images, the symbolism of the cross. Like some advancing pullulation
these groups and theories spread through the Near East into the Balkans,
Italy, and France. They bore heroically the most merciless persecutions,
and still survive as remnants in the Molokhani, the Khlysti, and the
Dukhobors.</p>
<p>The monothelite controversy was more agitated by the emperors than by
the people. And doubtless the people were not responsible for the
filioque that so tragically advanced the schism of Greek from Latin
Christianity. The Nicene Creed had spoken of “the Holy Ghost, who
proceedeth from the F ather”— ex patre procedit-, for 250 years this
sufficed; but in 589 a church council at Toledo made the statement read
ex patre filioque procedit — “pro - ceedeth from the Father and the
Son”; this addition was accepted in Gaul, and zealously adopted by
Charlemagne. The Greek theologians protested that the Holy Ghost
proceeded not from but through the Son. The popes held the balance
patiently for a time, and not until the eleventh century was the
filioque officially entered into the Latin creed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a struggle of wills was added to the conflict of ideas.
Among the monks who had fled from Iconoclastic oppression was Ignatius,
son of the Emperor Michael I. In 840 the Empress Theodora recalled the
monk, and made him patriarch. He was a man of piety and courage; he
denounced the prime minister Caesar Bardas, who had divorced his wife
and lived with the widow of his son; and when Bardas persisted in incest
Ignatius excluded him from the Church. Bardas banished Ignatius, and
raised to the patriarchate the most accomplished scholar of the age
(858).Photius (82o?~9i) was a master of philology, oratory, science, and
philosophy; his lectures at the University of Constantinople had drawn
to him a group of devoted students, to whom he opened his library and
his home. Shortly before his promotion to the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 529</p>
<p>patriarchal see he had completed an encyclopedic Myriobiblion in 280
chap- ters, each of which reviewed and sampled an important book;
through this vast compilation many passages of classic literature were
preserved. His broad culture raised Photius above the fanaticism of the
populace, which could not understand why he remained on such good terms
with the emir of Crete. His sudden elevation from layman to patriarch
offended the clergy of Constantinople; Ignatius refused to resign, and
appealed to the bishop of Rome. Nicholas I sent legates to
Constantinople to inquire into the case; and in letters to the Emperor
Michael III and Photius he laid down the principle that no
ecclesiastical matter of grave moment should be decided anywhere in
Christendom without the consent of the pope. The Emperor called a church
council, which ratified the appointment of Photius, and the Pope’s
legates joined in the confirmation. When they returned to Rome Nicholas
repudi- ated them as having exceeded their instructions; he ordered the
Emperor to reinstate Ignatius; and when his command was ignored he
excommunicated Photius (863). Bardas threatened to send an army to
depose Nicholas; the Pope, in an eloquent reply, scornfully pointed to
the Emperor’s submission to the marauding Slavs and Saracens.</p>
<p>We have not invaded Crete; we have not depopulated Sicily; we</p>
<p>have not subdued Greece; we have not burned the churches in the</p>
<p>very suburbs of Constantinople; yet while these pagans with impunity
conquer, bum, and lay waste 〔your territories〕, we, Catholic
Chris-</p>
<p>tians, are menaced with the vain terror of your arms. Ye release</p>
<p>Barabbas, and kill Christ . 27</p>
<p>Photius and the Emperor called another church council, which
excommuni- cated the Pope (867), and denounced the “heresies” of the
Roman Church— among them the procession of the Holy Ghost from the
Father and the Son, the shaving of priestly beards, and the enf orced
celibacy of the clergy; “from this usage,” said Photius, “we see in the
West so many children who do not know their fathers.”</p>
<p>While Greek messengers were bearing these pleasantries to Rome, the
situation was suddenly changed (867) by the accession of Basil I, who
had murdered Caesar Bardas and had superintended the assassination of
Michael III. Photius denounced the new Emperor as a murderer, and
refused him the sacraments. Basil called a church council, which
obediently deposed, in- sulted, and banished Photius, and restored
Ignatius. But when Ignatius soon thereafter died, Basil recalled
Photius; a council reinstated him as patriarch; and (Nicholas I having
died) Pope John VIII approved. The schism of East and West was for a
moment postponed by the death of the protagonists.</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>V. THE CHRISTIAN CONQUEST OF EUROPE! 529-IO54</p>
<p>The most momentous event in the religious history of these centuries
was not the quarrel of the Greek with the Latin Church, but the rise of
Islam as a challenge to Christianity in both East and West. The religion
of Christ had hardly consolidated its victories over the pagan Empire
and the heresies when suddenly its most fervid provinces were torn from
it, and with alarming ease, by a faith that scorned both the theology
and the ethics of Christianity. Patriarchs still sat, by Moslem
tolerance, in the sees of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria; but the
Christian glory was departed from those regions; and what Christianity
remained in them was heretical and nationalist. Armenia, Syria, and
Egypt had set up church hierarchies quite independent of either
Constantinople or Rome. Greece was saved to Christianity; there the
monks triumphed over the philosophers, and the great monastery of the
Holy Lavra, established on Mt. Athos in 96 1 , rivaled the majesty of
the Parthenon, which had become a Christian church. Africa still had
many Christians in the ninth century, but they were rapidly diminishing
under the handicaps of Moslem rule. In 7 1 1 most of Spain was lost to
Islam. Defeated in Asia and Africa, Christianity turned north, and
resumed the conquest of Europe.</p>
<p>Italy, bravely but narrowly saved from the Saracens, was divided
between the Greek and Latin forms of Christianity. Almost on the
dividing line was Monte Cassino. Under the long rule (1058-87) of Abbot
Desiderius the monastery reached the zenith of its fame. From
Constantinople he brought not only two magnificent bronze doors, but
craftsmen who adorned the in- teriors with mosaics, enamels, and
artistry in metal, ivory, and wood. The monastery became almost a
university, with courses in grammar, classical as well as Christian
literature, theology, medicine, and law. Following Byzan- tine models,
the monks executed exceptionally fine illuminated manuscripts, and
copied in a beautiful book hand the classics of pagan Rome; some
classics were only thus preserved. In Rome the Church, under Pope
Boniface IV and his successors, instead of permitting the further
disintegration of pagan tem- ples, reconsecrated them to Christian use
and care: the Pantheon was dedi- cated to the Virgin Mary and All
Martyrs (609) , the temple of Janus became the church of St. Dionysius,
the temple of Saturn became the church of the Saviour. Leo IV (847- 55)
renewed and embellished St. Peter’s; and through the growth of the
papacy and the coming of pilgrims, a polyglot suburb grew around that
group of ecclesiastical buildings which took its name from the ancient
Vatican Hill.</p>
<p>France was now the richest possession of the Latin Church. The
Merovin- gian kings, confident of buying heaven after enjoying polygamy
and murder, showered the bishoprics with lands and revenues. Here, as
elsewhere, the Church received legacies from penitent magnates and
devout heiresses; Chil-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 5 3 1</p>
<p>peric’s prohibition of such bequests was soon canceled by Gunthram.
By one of the many pleasantries of history, the Gallic clergy were
almost wholly recruited from the Gallo-Roman population; the converted
Franks knelt at the feet of those whom they had conquered, and gave back
in pious donations what they had stolen in war. 28 The clergy were the
ablest, best educated, and least immoral element in Gaul; they almost
monopolized literacy; and though a small minority led scandalous lives,
most of them labored faithfully to give schooling and morals to a
population suffering from the greed and wars of their lords and kings.
The bishops were the chief secular as well as religious authorities in
their dioceses; and their tribunals wer.e the favorite resort of
litigants even in non-ecclesiastical concerns. Everywhere they took
under their protection orphans and widows, paupers and slaves. In many
dioceses the Church provided hospitals; one such hoteUDieu — 1 inn of
God”— was opened in Paris in 65 1 . St. Germain, Bishop of Paris in the
second half of the sixth century, was known throughout Europe for his
work in raising funds — and spending his own — to emancipate slaves.
Bishop Sidonius of Mainz banked the Rhine; Bishop Felix of Nantes
straightened the course of the Loire; Bishop Didier of Cahors
constructed aqueducts. St. Agobard (779-</p>

superstition; he condemned trial by duel or ordeal, the worship of

time.” 29 Hincmar, the aristocratic</li>

<p>In each country Christianity took on the qualities of the national
tempera- ment. In Ireland it became mystic, sentimental,
individualistic, passionate; it adopted the fairies, the poetry, the
wild and tender imagination of the Celt; the priests inherited the magic
powers of the Druids and the myths of the bards; and the tribal
organization favored a centrifugal looseness in the struc- ture of the
Church — almost every locality had an independent “bishop.” More
numerous and influential than the bishops and priests were the monks
who, in groups seldom numbering more than twelve, formed half-isolated
and mostly autonomous monasteries throughout the island, recognizing the
pope as head of the Church, but submitting to no external control. The
earlier monks lived in separate cells, practicing a somber asceticism
and meeting only for prayer; a later generation — the “Second Order of
Irish Saints”— diverged from this Egyptian tradition, studied together,
learned Greek, copied manu- scripts, and established schools for clerics
and laity. From the Irish schools in the sixth and seventh centuries a
succession of renowned and redoubtable saints passed over into Scotland,
England, Gaul, Germany, and Italy to re- vitalize and educate a darkened
Christianity. “Almost all Ireland,” wrote a Frank about 850, “comes
flocking to our shores w ith a troop of philoso-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>phers.” 30 As Germanic invasions of Gaul and Britain had driven
scholars from those lands to Ireland, so now the wave returned, the debt
was paid; Irish missionaries flung themselves upon the victorious pagan
Angles, Saxons, Norwegians, and Danes in England, and upon the
illiterate and half-barba- rous Christians of Gaul and Germany, with the
Bible in one hand and classic manuscripts in the other; and for a time
it seemed that the Celts would win back through Christianity the lands
they had lost to force. It was in the Dark Ages that the Irish spirit
shone with its strongest light.</p>
<p>The greatest of these missionaries was St. Columba. We know him well
through the biography written (c. 679) by Adamnan, one of his successors
at Iona. Columba was born at Donegal in 52 1, of royal stock; like
Buddha he was a saint who could have been a king. At school in Moville
he showed such devotion that his schoolmaster named him Columbkille —
Column of the Church. From the age of twenty-five he founded a number of
churches and monasteries, of which the most famous were at Derry,
Durrow, and Kells. But he was a fighter as well as a saint, “a man of
powerful frame and mighty voice”; 31 his hot te mper drew him into many
quarrels, at last into war with King Diarmuid; a battle was fought in
which, we are told, 5000 men were killed; Columba, though victorious,
fled from Ireland (563), resolved to convert as many souls as had fallen
in that engagement at Cooldrevna. He now founded on the island of Iona,
off the west coast of Scotland, one of the most illustrious of medieval
monasteries. Thence he and his disciples brought the Gospel to the
Hebrides, Scotland, and northern England. And there, afte r converting
thousands of pagans and illuminating 300 “noble books,” he died, in
prayer at the altar, in his seventy-eighth year.</p>
<p>Kindred to him in spirit and name was St. Columban. Born in Leinster
about 543, he does not enter history till we find him, aged thirty-two,
estab- lishing monasteries in the wilds of the Vosges Mountains of
France. At Luxeuil he instructed his novices:</p>
<p>You must fast every day, pray every day, work every day, read</p>
<p>every day. A monk must live under the rule of one father, and in the
society of many brethren, that he may learn humility from one, pa-</p>
<p>tience from another, silence from a third, gentleness from a
fourth.</p>
<p>. . . He must go to bed so tired that he will fall asleep on the way.
32</p>
<p>Punishments were severe, usually by flogging: six stripes for
coughing when beginning a psalm, or neglecting to manicure the nails
before saying Mass, or smiling during services, or striking the teeth on
the chalice at communion; twelve for omitting grace at meal; fifty for
being late at prayers, one hundred for engaging in a dispute, two
hundred for speaking familiarly with a woman. 33 Despite this reign of
terror there was no lack of novices; Luxeuil had sixty monks, many from
rich families. They lived on bread, vegetables, and water, cleared
forests, plowed fields, planted and reaped, fasted and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 533</p>
<p>prayed. Here Columban established the Ictus perennis, or unending
praise: all day and night, through relays of monks, litanies were to
rise to Jesus, Mary, and the Saints. 34 A thousand monasteries like
Luxeuil are a pervasive element in the medieval scene.</p>
<p>The stern temper that framed this rule allowed no compromise with
other views; and Columban, who banned disputes, found himself in
repeated quar- rels with the bishops — whose authority he ignored — with
secular officials — whose interferences he repelled — and even with the
popes. For the Irish cele- brated Easter according to a reckoning
practiced by the early Church but abandoned by her in 343. In a
consequent conflict with the Gallic clergy these appealed to Gregory the
Great; Columban rejected the Pope’s instruc - tions, saying, “The Irish
are better astronomers than you Romans,” and bade Gregory accept the
Irish mode of calcu lation or be “looked upon as a heretic and
repudiated with scorn by the churches of the West.” 35 The rebellious
Irishman was expelled from Gaul (609) for denouncing the wickedness of
Queen Brunhild; he was put by force on a vessel bound for Ireland; the
ship was driven back to France; Columban crossed the forbidden land and
preached to the pagans of Bavaria. He could hardly have been as terrible
a man as his rule and career picture him, for we are told that squirrels
perched confidently on his shoulders and ran in and out of his cowl. 36
Leaving a fellow Irishman to found (613) the monastery of St. Gall on
Lake Constance, he painfully crossed the St. Gotthard Pass, and
established the monastery of Bobbio in Lombardy in 613. There, two years
later, in the austerity of his solitary cell, he died.</p>
<p>Tertullian mentions Christians in Britain in 208; Bede speaks of
St. Alban as dying in the persecution by Diocletian; British bishops
attended the Coun- cil of Sardica (347). Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre,
went to Britain in 429 to suppress the Pelagian heresy. 37 William of
Malmesbury avers that the Bishop, presumably on a later visit, routed an
army of Saxons by having his British converts shout “Hallelujah!” at
them. 38 From this vigorous condition British Christianity pined and
almost died in the Anglo-Saxon invasions; we hear nothing of it again
until, at the end of the sixth century, the disciples of Columba entered
Northumberland, and Augustine, with seven other monks, reached England
from Rome. Doubtless Pope Gregory had learned that Ethelbert, the pagan
King of Kent, had married Bertha, a Christian Merovingian princess.
Ethelbert listened courteously to Augustine, remained unconvinced, but
gave him freedom to preach, and provided food and lodg- ing for him and
his fellow monks in Canterbury. At last ( 599) the Queen prevailed upon
the King to accept the new faith; and many subjects followed their
example. In 60 1 Gregory sent the pallium to Augustine, who became the
first in an impressive line of distinguished archbishops of Canterbury.
Gregory was lenient to the lingering paganism of England; he allowed
the</p>
<p>T H E AGE Or F A 1 T II</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>old temples to be christened into churches, and permitted the custom
of sac- rificing oxen to the gods to be gently transformed into “killing
them to the refreshing of themselves to the praise of God”; 3 ” so that
the English merely changed from eating beef when they praised God to
praising God when they ate beef.</p>
<p>Another Italian missionary, Paulinus, carried Christianity to
Northumber- land (627). Oswald, King of Northumberland, invited the
monks of Iona to come and preach to his people; and to help their work
he gave them the island of Lindisfarne off the east coast. There
St. Aidan (634) founded a monastery that glorified its name by
missionary devotion and the splendor of its illuminated manuscripts.
There and at Melrose Abbey St. Cuthbert (635? — 87) left behind him
loving memories of his patience, piety, good humor, and good sense. The
holiness of such men, and perhaps the peace and security they enjoyed
amid recurrent wars, brought many neophytes to the monasteries and
nunneries that now arose in England. Despite occa- sional lapses into
the ways of common men, the monks gave dignity to work by their labor in
woods and fields; here too, as in France and Germany, they led the
advance of civilization against marsh and jungle as well as against
illiteracy, violence, lechery, drunkenness, and greed. Bede thought that
too many Englishmen were entering monasteries; that too many monasteries
were being founded by nobles to put their property beyond taxation; and
that the tax-exempt lands of the Church were absorbing too much of Eng-
land’s soil; too few soldiers wer e left, he warned, to preserve England
from invasion. 40 Soon the Danes, then the Normans, would prove the
worldly wis- dom of the monk.</p>
<p>Strife found its way even into monastic peace when the Benedictine
monks of southern England, following the Roman ritual and calendar, came
into contact and conflict with the Irish monks and calendar and liturgy
in the north. At the Synod of Whitby (664) St. Wilfrid’s eloquence
decided the issue — technically, the proper day for Easter — in favor of
Rome. The Irish missionaries pugnaciously resigned themselves to the
decision. The British Church, unified and endowed, became an economic
and political power, and took a leading role in civilizing the people
and governing the state.</p>
<p>Christianity came to Germany as the gift of Irish and English monks.
In 690 the Northumbrian monk Willibrord, who had been educated in
Ireland, crossed the North Sea with twelve adventurous aides, fixed his
episcopal seat at Utrecht, and labored for forty years to convert the
Frisians. But these realistic lowlanders saw in Willibrord the hand of
his protector Pepin the Young, and feared that their conversion would
subject them to the Franks; moreover, they were not pleased to be told
that all their unbaptized forebears were in hell. A Frisian king, having
learned this as he stood on the brink</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 535</p>
<p>of baptism, turned away, saying that he preferred to spend eternity
with his ancestors. 41</p>
<p>A stronger man than Willibrord renewed the campaign in 716. Winfrid
(68 o?- 754) , an English noble and Benedictine monk, won the name of
Boni- face from Pope Gregory II, and the title of “Apostle of Germany”
from a pious posterity. Near Fritzlar in Hesse he found an oak tree
worshiped by the people as the home of a god; he felled it; and the
populace, amazed at his survival, flocked to be baptized. Great
monasteries were set up at Reiche- nau (724), Fulda (744), andLorsch
(763). In 748 Boniface was made Arch- bishop of Mainz; he appointed
bishops, and organized the German Church into a powerful engine of
moral, economic, and political order. Having ac- complished his mission
in Hesse and Thuringia, and seeking to crown his career with a martyr’s
death, Boniface gave up his proud episcopate, and entered Frisia
resolved to complete the work of Willibrord. He had labored there a year
when he was attacked by the pagans and slain. A generation later
Charlemagne brought Christianity to the Saxons with fire and sword; the
obstinate Frisians thought it ti me to yield; and the conquest of Rome’s
conquerors by Roman Christianity was complete.</p>
<p>The final triumph of the faith in Europe was the conversion of the
Slavs. In 861 Prince Rostislav of Moravia, noting the entrance into his
realm of a Latin Christianity that ignored the vernacular in its
liturgy, applied to By- zantium for missionaries who would preach and
pray in the vulgar tongue. The emperor sent him two brothers, Methodius
and Cyril, who, having been reared in Salonika, spoke Slavonic with
ease. They were welcomed, but found that the Slavs had as yet no
alphabet to fully express their language in writing; the few Slavs who
wrote used Greek and Latin characters to represent their speech. Cyril
thereupon invented the Slavonic alphabet and script by adopting the
Greek alphabet with the values that Greek usage had given it by the
ninth century — B sounded as V, H as / (English E ) , Chi as the Scotch
ch; and he devised original letters for Slavonic sounds not express-
ible by Greek characters. With this alphabet Cyril translated into
Slavonic the Septuagint Greek version of the Old Testament, and the
Greek liturgical texts, thereby inaugurating a new written language and
a new literature.</p>
<p>A struggle now ensued between Greek and Latin Christianity to see
which should capture the Slavs. Pope Nicholas I invited Cyril and
Methodius to Rome, where Cyril took monastic vows, fell ill, and died
(869) ; Methodius returned to Moravia as an archbishop consecrated by
the Pope. Pope John VIII allowed the use of the Slavonic liturgy,
Stephen V forbade it. Moravia, Bohemia, and Slovakia (these constituting
the Czechoslovakia of today) , and later Hungary and Poland, were won to
the Latin Church and rite; while Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia accepted
the Slavonic liturgy and alphabet, gave</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>5 3 &lt;&gt;</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>their allegiance to the Greek Church, and took their culture from
Byzantium.</p>
<p>Political calculations influenced these religious transformations.
The con- version of the Germans aimed to incorporate them firmly into
the realm of the Franks. King Harald Bluetooth imposed Christianity upon
Denmark (974) as part of the price that the Emperor Otto II demanded for
peace; Boris of Bulgaria, after flirting with the papacy, went over to
the Greek Church (864) to win protection against an expanding Germany;
and Vladi- mir I made Russia Christian (988) to win the hand of Anna,
sister of the Greek Emperor Basil II, and to obtain part of the Crimea
as her dowry. 42 For two centuries the Russian Church acknowledged the
patriarch of Con- stantinople; in the thirteenth century it declared its
independence; and after the fall of the Eastern Empire (1453) the
Russian Church became the domi- nant factor in the Greek Orthodox
world.</p>
<p>The victorious soldiers in this Christian conquest of Europe were the
monks, and the nurses in this war were the nuns. The monks helped the
peas- ant pioneers to bring the wilderness under cultivation, to clear
the forest and the brush, to drain the swamps and bridge the creeks and
cut the roads; they organized industrial centers, schools, and charity;
copied manuscripts and collected modest libraries; gave moral order,
courage, and comfort to be- wildered men uprooted from their traditional
customs, cults, or homes. Ben- edict of Aniane labored, dug, and reaped
amid his monks; and the monk Theodulf, near Reims, drove the plow so
faithfully for twenty-two years that after his death it was kept as an
object of veneration.</p>
<p>Periodically, after superhuman exaltations of virtue, devotion, and
energy, monks and nuns relapsed into human nature, and in almost every
century a campaign of monastic reform was needed to lift the monks again
to the un- natural heights of their rule. Some monks enlisted in passing
moods of piety and self -surrender, and were maladapted to the
discipline after their ecstasy waned. Some were oblates, who had been
brought to the monasteries and vowed to the monastic life by their
parents when they were children of seven or more years of age, sometimes
when they were infants in the cradle; and these vicarious vows were held
irrevocable until, in 1 1 79, papal decrees allowed their annulment at
the age of fourteen. 43 In 817 Louis the Pious, shocked by the lax
discipline of French monasteries, called a national assem- bly of abbots
and monks at Aachen, and commissioned Benedict of Aniane to re-establish
the Rule of St. Benedict of Nursia in all the monasteries of the realm.
The new Benedict labored sedulously; but he died in 821, the wars of the
kings soon disordered the Frank Empire, and Norman, Magyar, and Saracen
raids despoiled hundreds of monasteries. Monks wandered homeless into
the secular world; and those who returned after the wave of devastation
had receded brought with them worldly ways. Feudal lords seized
monasteries, appointed their abbots, appropriated their revenues. By</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 537</p>
<p>900 the monasteries of the West, like almost every institution in
Latin Eu- rope, had sunk to the lowest point in their medieval history.
Some clergy, secular and regular, said St. Odo of Cluny (d. 942), “do so
set to naught the Virgin’s Son that they commit fornication in His very
courts, nay in those very inns which the devotion of the faithful hath
built in order that chastity may be kept safely within their fenced
precincts; they so overflow with lust that Mary hath no room wherein to
lay the child Jesus.” 44 It was from Cluny that the great reform of the
monasteries came.</p>
<p>About 910 twelve monks had established a monastery there in the hills
of Burgundy, almost on the German-French frontier. In 927 Abbot Odo
revised its rule towards a moral rigor combined with physical lenience:
asceticism was rejected, baths were recommended, diet was generous, beer
and wine were allowed; but the old vows of poverty, obedience, and
chastity were to be unremittingly enforced. Similar institutions were
opened else- where in France; but whereas each monastery had heretofore
been a law- less law unto itself, or had been loosely subject to local
bishop or lord, the new Benedictine monasteries allied with Cluny were
ruled by priors subject both to the abbots of Cluny and to the popes.
Under Cluny ’s abbots Mayeul (954-94), Odilo (994-1049), and Hugh
(1049-1109) the movement for monastic affiliation spread from France to
England, Germany, Poland, Hun- gary, Italy, and Spain; many old
monasteries joined the “Cluniac Congre - gation”; by 1 100 some 2000
“priories” acknowledged Cluny as their mo ther and ruler. The power so
organized, free from state interference and episcopal supervision, gave
the papacy a new weapon with which to control the secular hierarchy of
the Church. At the same time it made possible a coura- geous reform of
monasticism by the monks themselves. Disorder, idleness, luxury,
immorality, simony were brought under firm rule; and Italy beheld the
strange sight of a French monk, Odo, invited to Italy to reform Monte
Cassino itself. 45</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE NADIR OF THE PAPACY: 867-IO49</li>
</ol>
<p>Reform reached Rome last of all. The populace of the city had always
been unmanageable, even when the Imperial eagle had wielded legions in
its claws; now the pontiffs, armed only with a weak militia, the majesty
of their office, and the terror of their creed, found themselves the
prisoners of a jealous aristocracy, and of a citizenry whose piety
suffered from nearness to Peter’s throne. The Romans were too proud to
be impressed by kings, and too familiar to be awed by popes; they saw in
the Vicars of Christ men subject like themselves to sickness, error,
sin, and defeat; and they came to view the papacy not as a fortress of
order and a tower of salvation, but as a collection agency whereby the
pence of Europe might provide the dole of Rome. By the tradition of the
Church no pope could be elected without</p>
<p>538 THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>the consent of the Roman clergy, nobles, and populace. The rulers of
Spo- leto, Benevento, Naples, and Tuscany, and the aristocracy of Rome
divided into factions as of old; and whichever faction prevailed in the
city intrigued to choose and sway the pope. Between them they dragged
the papacy, in the tenth century, to the lowest level in its
history.</p>
<p>In 878 Duke Lambert of Spoleto entered Rome with his army, seized
Pope John VIII, and tried to starve him into favoring Carloman for the
Imperial throne. In 897 Pope Stephen VI had the corpse of Pope Formosus
(891-6) exhumed, dressed it in purple robes, and tried before an
ecclesiastic council on the charge of violating certain Church laws; the
corpse was condemned, stripped, mutilated, and plunged into the Tiber.
46 In the same year a polit- ical revolution in Rome overthrew Stephen,
who was strangled in jail. 47 For several years thereafter the papal
chair was filled by bribery, murder, or the favor of women of high rank
and low morality. For half a century the fam- ily of Theophylact, a
chief official of the papal palace, made and unmade popes at will. His
daughter Marozia secured the election of her lover as Pope Sergius III
(904-11); 48 his wife Theodora procured the election of Pope John X
(914- 28). John has been accused of being Theodora’s paramour, but on
inadequate evidence; 49 certainly he was an excellent secular leader,
for it was he who organized the coalition that in 916 repulsed the
Saracens from Rome. Marozia, after having enjoyed a succession of
lovers, married Guido, Duke of Tuscany; they conspired to unseat John;
they had his brother Peter killed before his face; the Pope was thrown
into prison, and died there a few months later from causes unknown. In
93 1 Marozia raised to the papacy John XI (931-5), commonly reputed to
be her bastard son by Sergius III. 50 In 932 her son Alberic imprisoned
John in the Castle of Sant’ An gelo, but allowed him to exercise from
jail the spiritual functions of the papacy. For twenty-two years Alberic
ruled Rome as the dictatorial head of a “Roman Republic.” At his death
he bequeathed his power to his son Octavian, and made the clergy and
people promise to choose Octavian pope when Agapetus II should die. It
was done as he ordered; in 955 Maro- zia’s grandson became John XII, and
distinguished his pontificate by orgies of debauchery in the Lateran
palace. 51</p>
<p>Otto I of Germany, crowned Emperor by John XII in 962, learned the
degradation of the papacy at first hand. In 963, with the support of the
Trans- alpine clergy, Otto returned to Rome, and summoned John to trial
before an ecclesiastical council. Cardinals charged that John had taken
bribes for consecrating bishops, had made a boy of ten a bishop, had
committed adul- tery with his father’s concubine and incest with his
father’s widow and her niece, and had made the papal palace a very
brothel. John refused to attend the council or to answer the charges;
instead he went out hunting. The coun- cil deposed him and unanimously
chose Otto’s candidate, a layman, as Pope Leo VIII (963-5). After Otto
had returned to Germany John seized and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 539</p>
<p>mutilated the leaders of the Imperial party in Rome, and had himself
re- stored by an obedient council to the papacy (964) . 52 When John
died (964) the Romans elected Benedict V, ignoring Leo. Otto came down
from Ger- many, deposed Benedict, and restored Leo, who thereupon
officially recog- nized the right of Otto and his Imperial successors to
veto the election of any future pope.* On Leo’s death Otto secured the
election of John XIII (965 — 7 2 ) . Benedict VI (973-4) was imprisoned
and strangled by a Roman noble, Bonifazio Francone, who made himself
pope for a month, then fled to Constantinople with as much papal
treasury as he could carry. Nine years later he returned, killed Pope
John XIV (983-4), again appropriated the papal office, and died
peaceably in bed (985). The Roman Republic again raised its head,
assumed authority, and chose Crescentius as consul. Otto III descended
upon Rome with an irresistible army, and a commission from the German
prelates to end the chaos by making his chaplain Pope Gregory V (996-9)
. The young Emperor put down the Republic, pardoned Crescen- tius, and
went back to Germany. Crescentius at once re-established the Republic,
and deposed Gregory (997). Gregory excommunicated him, but Crescentius
laughed, and arranged the election of John XVI as pope. Otto returned,
deposed John, gouged out his eyes, cut off his tongue and nose, and
paraded him through the streets of Rome on an ass, with his face to the
tail. Crescentius and twelve Republican leaders were beheaded, and their
bodies were hung from the battlements of Sant’ Angelo (99s). 53 Gregory
resumed the papacy, and died, probably of poison, in 999. Otto replaced
him with one of the most brilliant of all the popes.</p>
<p>Gerbert was born of lowly parentage near Aurillac in Auvergne ( c .
940), and at an early age entered a monastery there. At the abbot’s
suggestion, he went to Spain to study mathematics; and in 970 Count
Borel of Barcelona took him to Rome. Pope John XIII was impressed by the
monk’s learn ing, and recommended him to Otto I. For a year Gerbert
taught in Italy, and at that time or later had Otto II among his pupils.
Then he went to Reims to study logic in the cathedral school; and
presently we find him head of the school (972-82). He taught an unusual
variety of subjects, including the classic poets; he wrote an excellent
Latin, and letters sometimes rivaling those of Sidonius. Wherever he
went he collected books, and spent his funds recklessly to have copies
made of manuscripts in other libraries; perhaps we owe to him the
preservation of Cicero’s orations. 54 He led the Christian world in
mathematics, introduced an early form of the “Arabic” numerals, wrote on
the abacus and the astrolabe, and composed a treatise on geometry; he
invented a mechanical clock, and an organ operated by steam. 55 So many
were his scientific accomplishments that after his death he was reputed
to have possessed magical powers. 5 ”</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>When Adalbero died (988), Gerbert sought to succeed him as archbishop
of Reims; but Hugh Capet appointed instead Arnulf, a bastard son of the
dying Carolingian house. Arnulf plotted against Hugh, an ecclesiastical
council deposed him despite papal protests, and chose Gerbert archbishop
(991). Four years later a papal legate persuaded a synod at Moisson to
un- seat Gerbert. The humiliated scholar went to the court of Otto III
in Ger- many, received every honor there, and molded the mind of the
young king to the idea of restoring a Roman Empire with its capital at
Rome. Otto made him archbishop of Ravenna, and, in 999, pope. Gerbert
took the name of Sylvester II, as if to say that he would be a second
Sylvester to a second world-unifying Constantine. Had he and Otto lived
another decade they might have realized their dream, for Otto was the
son of a Byzantine prin- cess, and Gerbert might have become a
philosopher-king. But in the fourth year of his papacy Gerbert died,
poisoned, said Roman rumor, by the same Stephania who had poisoned
Otto.</p>
<p>Their aspirations, and the busy politics of the world around them,
show how few were the Christians who took seriously the notion that the
world would end in the year 1000. At the beginning of the tenth century
a Church council had announced that the final century of history had
begun; 67 at its close a small minority of men so believed, and prepared
themselves for the Last Judgment. The great majority went on their
wonted ways, working, playing, sinning, praying, and trying to outlive
senility. There is no evi- dence of any panic of fear in the year 1000,
nor even of any rise in gifts to the Church. 58</p>
<p>After the death of Gerbert the decay of the papacy was resumed. The
counts of Tusculum, in league with the German emperors, bought bishops
and sold the papacy with hardly an effort at concealment. Their nominee
Benedict VIII (1012-24) was a man of vigor and intelligence; but
Benedict IX (1032-45), made pope at the age of twelve, led so shameful
and riotous a life 59 that the people rose and drove him out of Rome.
Through Tusculan aid he was restored; but tiring of the papacy he sold
it to Gregory VI (1045-</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>for one (or two) thousand pounds of gold. 00 Gregory astonished Rome
by being almost a model pope; apparently he had bought the papacy in a
sincere desire to reform it and liberate it from its overlords. The
Tusculan house could not favor such a reform; it made Benedict IX pope
again, while a third faction set up Sylvester III. The Italian clergy
appealed to the Em- peror Henry III to end this disgrace; he came to
Sutri, near Rome, and con- vened an ecclesiastical council; it
imprisoned Sylvester, accept ed Benedict’s resignation, and deposed
Gregory for admittedly buying the papacy. Henry persuaded the council
that only a foreign pope, protected by the emperor, could terminate the
debasement of the Church. The Bishop of Bamberg was elected as Clement
II (1046-7); he died a year later; and Damasus II</li>
</ol>
<p>(1047-8) also succumbed to the malaria that now regularly came out
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 541</p>
<p>the undrained Campagna. At last in Leo IX (1049-54) the papacy found
a man who could face its problems with courage, learning, integrity, and
a piety long rare in Rome.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE REFORM OF THE CHURCH: IO49-54</li>
</ol>
<p>Three internal problems agitated the Church at this time: simony in
the papacy and the episcopacy, marriage or concubinage in the secular
clergy, and sporadic incontinence among the monks.</p>
<p>Simony — the sale of church offices or services — was the
ecclesiastical cor- relate of contemporary corruption in politics. Good
people were one source of simony; so the mother of Guibert of Nogent,
anxious to devote him to the Church, paid ecclesiastical authorities to
make him a cathedral canon at eleven; a church council at Rome in 1099
mourned the frequency of such cases. As bishops in England, Germany,
France, and Italy administered pro- fane as well as ecclesiastical
affairs, and were feudally endowed with lands or villages or even cities
to supply their necessary revenues, ambitious men paid secular powers
great sums for such appointments, and greedy poten- tates overrode all
decencies to earn these bribes. In Narbonne a boy of ten was made
archbishop on paying 100,000 solidi (1016). 61 Philip I of France
consoled an unsuccessful applicant for an episcopal see with blithe
counsel: “Let me make my profit out of your rival; then y ou can try to
get him de- graded for simony; and afterward we can see about satisfying
you.” 62 The French kings, following a tradition established by
Charlemagne, regularly appointed the bishops of Sens, Reims, Lyons,
Tours, and Bourges; elsewhere in France the bishops were appointed by
dukes or counts. 63 Many bishoprics became in the eleventh century the
hereditary patrimony of noble families, and were used as provision for
bastards or younger sons; in Germany one baron possessed and transmitted
eight bishoprics. 61 A German cardinal alleged ( c . 1048) that the
simoniacal buyers of sees and benefices had sold the marble facings of
churches, even the tiles from their roofs, to reimburse themselves for
the cost of their appointments. 65 Such appointees were men of the
world; many lived in luxury, engaged in war, allowed bribery in epis-
copal courts, 66 named relatives to ecclesiastical posts, and worshiped
Mam- mon with undivided loyalty; Pope Innocent III would say of an
archbishop of Narbonne that he had a purse where his heart should have
been. 67 The purchase of sees became so usual that practical men
accepted it as normal; but reformers cried out that Simon Magus had
captured the Church. 68</p>
<p>Among the general clergy the moral problem hovered between marriage
and concubinage. In the ninth and tenth centuries the marriage of
priests was customary in England, Gaul, and north Italy. Pope Hadrian II
(867-72) himself had been a married man; 69 and Bishop Ratherius of
Verona (tenth</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>542</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>century) reported that practically all priests in his diocese were
married. By the beginning of the eleventh century celibacy in the
secular clergy was exceptional. 70 It would be a mistake to consider
clerical marriage immoral; though often contrary to the canons and
ideals of the Church, it was quite in accord with the customs and moral
judgments of the times. At Milan a married priest stood higher in public
repute than one unmarried; 71 the latter was suspected of concubinage.
Even concubinage — the regular cohabitation of an unmarried man with an
unmarried woman — was condoned by public opinion. The great majority of
the European clergy led apparently decent moral lives; and all through
the Middle Ages we hear of priests and bishops living in saintly
devotion to their flocks. Here and there, however, there were scandalous
exceptions. In 742 Bishop Boniface complained to Pope Zachary that
bishoprics were being given to “greedy laymen and adulterous clerics,”
72 and that some deacons “kept four or five concubines”; 73 and the
Venerable Bede, in the same century, condemned “some bishops” of England
for “laughter, jesting, tales, revelings, drunkenness, and . . .
dissolute liv - ing.” 74 Towards the end of the first millennium such
charges became more numerous. Ralph Glaber described the clergy of that
period as sharing in the general immorality of the age. An Italian monk,
Peter Damian (1007-72), presented to the Pope a book ominously entitled
Liber Gomorrhianus , in which he described, with the exaggerations to be
expected from his sanctity, the vices of the clergy; one chapter was “On
the Diversity of Sins Against Nature.” Damian strongly urged the
prohibition of clerical marriage.</p>
<p>The Church had long since opposed clerical marriage on the ground
that a married priest, consciously or not, would put his loyalty to wife
and chil- dren above his devotion to the Church; that for their sake he
would be tempted to accumulate money or property; that he would try to
transmit his see or benefice to one of his offspring; that an hereditary
ecclesiastical caste might in this way develop in Europe as in India;
and that the combined eco- nomic power of such a propertied priesthood
would be too great for the papacy to control. The priest should be
totally devoted to God, the Church, and his fellow men; his moral
standard must be higher than that of the people, and must confer upon
him the prestige necessary to public confidence and reverence. Several
councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy; one — at Pavia in 1 o 1 8
— had decreed a status of perpetual slavery, and disbarment from
inheritance, for all children of priests. 75 But clerical marriage
continued.</p>
<p>Leo IX found the see of Peter impoverished by clerical bequests of
Church benefices to clerical offspring, by baronial seizures of Church
estates, and by the highway robbery of pilgrims bringing prayers,
petitions, and offerings to Rome. He organized protection for the
pilgrims, recaptured alienated ec- clesiastical property, and set
himself to the heavy task of ending simony and clerical marriage.
Turning over the domestic and administrative cares of the papacy to the
shrewd and devoted monk who was to become Gregory VII,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 543</p>
<p>Leo left Rome in 1049, resolved to examine at first hand the morals
of the clergy, and the functioning of the Church, in the major cities of
Europe. The dignity of his bearing, the unaffected austerity of his
life, at once revived the respect that men had held for the highest
official of the Church; vice hid its head as he approached; and Godfrey
of Lorraine, who had plundered churches and defied kings, trembled under
papal excommunication, sub- mitted to be publicly scourged before the
altar of the church that he had ruined in Verdun, undertook to repair
the church, and labored in the work with his own hands. At Cologne Leo
held papal court, and received every honor from a German clergy proud of
a German pope. Passing into France, he presided over a tribunal at
Reims, and conducted an inquiry into lay and clerical morals, the sale
of ecclesiastical offices, the spoliation of church prop- erty, the
relaxation of monastic rules, and the rise of heresy. Every bishop
present was ordered to confess his sins. One after another, including
arch- bishops, accused himself. Leo sternly reproved them, deposed some,
forgave some, excommunicated four, summoned others to Rome and public
penance. He commanded the clergy to dismiss their wives and concubines,
and to forgo the use of arms. The Council of Reims further decreed that
bishops and abbots were to be elected by the clergy and the people,
prohibited the sale of ecclesiastical offices, and forbade the clergy to
receive fees for admin- istering the eucharist, attending the sick, or
burying the dead. A council in Mainz ( 1 049) , under Leo’s urging,
enacted similar reforms for Germany. In 1050 he returned to Italy,
presided at the Council of Vercelli, and con- demned the heresy of
Berengar of Tours.</p>
<p>With his long and arduous visitation of the North Leo had restored
the prestige of the papacy, replaced the German emperor as the head of
the Ger- man Church, brought the French and Spanish episcopates to
acknowledge the authority of the pope, and made some progress toward
cleansing the clergy of venality and venery. In 1051 and 1052 he made
further campaigns in Germany and France; presided over a great
ecclesiastical assembly at Worms, and another at Mantua. Returning at
last to Rome, he took on the uncongenial task of defending the Papal
States by military means. The Em- peror Henry III had given him the
duchy of Benevento; Duke Pandulf of Capua refused to recognize the
grant, and, with the help of Robert Guis- card’s Norm ans, took and held
the duchy. Leo asked for a German army to help him oust Pandulf; he
received only 700 men; to these he added some un- trained Italians; and
at their head he marched against the Normans, whose cavalry alone
numbered 3000 buccaneers skilled in war. The Normans over- whelmed Leo’s
forces, captured him, and then knelt to ask his pardon for having killed
500 of his men. They took him to Benevento, and there, with all
courtesy, kept him prisoner for nine months. Heartbroken, and penitent
for having taken the sword, Leo wore nothing but sackcloth, slept on a
car- pet and a stone, and passed nearly all the day in prayer. The
Normans saw</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>that he was dying, and released him. He entered Rome amid universal
rejoic- ing, absolved all whom he had excommunicated, ordered a coffin
placed in St. Peter’s, sat beside it for a day, and died at the altar.
The lame, the dumb, and the lepers came from all parts of Italy to touch
his corpse.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE GREAT EASTERN SCHISM: IO54</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in St. Leo’s pontificate that Greek and Latin Christianity
were fi - nally divorced. While Western Europe was shrouded in the
darkness, misery, and ignorance of the ninth and tenth centuries, the
Eastern Empire, under the Macedonian emperors (867-1057), recovered some
of the territory it had lost to the Arabs, reasserted its leadership in
south Italy, and experienced a new flowering of literature and art. The
Greek Church drew strength and pride from the revived wealth and power
of the Byzantine state, won Russia, Bulgaria, and Serbia to the Eastern
observance, and resented more sh’arply than ever the claims of a debased
and impoverished papacy to the ecclesiasti- cal monarchy of the
Christian world. To the Greeks of this age the Germans, Franks, and
Anglo-Saxons of the contemporary West seemed crude bar- barians, an
illiterate and violent laity led by a worldly and corrupt episcopate.
The papal rejection of the Byzantine emperor for the king of the Franks,
the papal appropriation of the exarchate of Ravenna, the papal
coronation of a rival Roman emperor, the papal drive into Greek Italy —
these galling political events, and not the slight diversities of creed,
severed Christendom into East and West.</p>
<p>In 1043 Michael Cerularius was appointed Patriarch of Constantinople.
He was a man of noble birth, wide culture, keen intellect, and resolute
will. Though a monk, he had risen through a political rather than an
ecclesiastical career; he had been a high minister of the Empire, and
would hardly have ac- cepted the patriarchate if it had involved
submission to Rome. In 1053 he cir- culated a Latin treatise by a Greek
monk, which strongly criticized the Roman Church for enforcing clerical
celibacy contrary to apostolic example and ecclesiastical tradition, for
using unleavened bread in the Eucharist, and for adding filioque to the
Nicene Creed. In that same year Cerularius closed all those churches in
Constantinople that observed the Latin ritual, and ex- communicated all
clergy who should persist in its use. Leo, then at the height of his
pontificate, despatched a letter to Cerularius demanding that the Patri-
arch should recognize the supremacy of the popes, and branding any
church that refused such recognitio n as “an assembly of heretics, a
conventicle of schismatics, a synagogue of Satan.” 76 In a milder mood
Leo sent legates to Constantinople to discuss with the emperor and the
Patriarch the differences that kept the two branches of Christianity
apart. The emperor received the legates cordially, but Cerularius denied
their competence to deal with the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 545</p>
<p>issues. Leo died in April, 1054, and the papacy remained vacant for a
year. In July the legates, taking matters into their own hands,
deposited on the altar of St. Sophia a bull excommunicating Cerularius.
Michael convened a coun- cil representing all Eastern Christianity; it
recapitulated the grievances of the Greek against the Roman Church,
including the shaving of the beard; it for- mally condemned the bull of
the legates, and “all who had helped in drawing it up, whether by their
advice or even by their prayers.” 77 The schism was now complete.</p>

<li>GREGORY VII HILDEBRAND: IO73-85</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a great misfortune for Christianity that an interval of chaos
and weakness separated the pontificate of Leo. IX from that of one of
the strong- est popes in the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Hildebrand is a German name, and suggests a German lineage; Gregory’s
contemporaries interpreted it to mean Hellbrand, pure flame. He was born
of lowly parentage in the hamlet of Sovano in the marshes of Tuscany
(1023?). He was educated in the convent of St. Mary on the Aventine at
Rome, and entered the Benedictine order. When Pope Gregory VI was de-
posed and banished to Germany in 1046 Hildebrand accompanied him as
chaplain; during that year in Cologne he learned much about Germany that
helped him in his later struggle with Henry IV. Soon after his return to
Rome he was made a cardinal subdeacon by Leo IX, and was appointed
administra- tor of the Papal States and at the same time legate to
France; we may judge from this remarkable elevation of a youth of
twenty-five the reputation that he had so soon acquired for political
and diplomatic ability. Popes Victor II (1055-7) andStephenIX (1057-8)
continued to employ him in high capaci- ties. In 1059 Nicholas II became
Pope largely through Hildebrand’s influ - ence; and the indispensable
monk, not yet a priest, was made papal chan- cellor.</p>
<p>It was at his urging that Nicholas and the Later an Council of 1057
issued an edict transferring the election of the pope to the College of
Cardinals; by that one stroke Hildebrand proposed to rescue the papacy
from Roman nobles and German emperors. Already the young ecclesiastical
statesman had formulated a far-reaching policy. To secure the papacy
from German domination he closed his eyes to the swashbuckling raids of
the Normans in southern Italy, recognized their expropriations, and
approved their ambi- tions, in return for a pledge of military
protection. In 1073, after serving eight popes for twenty-five years,
Hildebrand himself was raised to the papacy. He resisted, preferring to
rule behind the throne; but cardinals, clergy , and people cried out,
“St. Peter wills Hildebrand to be Pope!” He was ordained priest, was
consecrated Pope, and took the honored name of Gregory.</p>
<p>THE AGE OE FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>He was small of stature, homely of feature, keen of eye, proud of
spirit, strong of will, sure of the truth, and confident of victory.
Four purposes in- spired him: to complete Leo’s reform of clerical
morals, to end lay investi - ture, to unify all Europe in one church and
one republic headed by the papacy, and to lead a Christian army to the
East to reclaim the Holy Land from the Turks. Early in 1074 he wrote to
the counts of Burgundy and Savoy, and to the Emperor Henry IV, begging
them to raise funds and troops for a crusade which he proposed to lead
in person. The counts were not moved, and Henry was too insecure on his
throne to think of a crusade.</p>
<p>The Lateran Council of 1059, under Nicholas II and Hildebrand, had
ex- communicated any priest who kept a wife or a concubine, and had
forbidden Christians to attend the Mass of a priest known to keep a
woman in his house. Reluctant to break up the families of their clergy,
many bishops in Lombardy refused to promulgate these decrees, and
prominent clerics in Tuscany de- fended clerical marriage as both moral
and canonical. The legislation could not be enforced, and the idea that
clergymen living in “sin” could not ad - minister valid sacraments was
so enthusiastically taken up by heretical preachers that the papal
appeal to the congregations was withdrawn. 78 When Hildebrand became
Gregory VII (1073) he attacked the problem with un- compromising
determination. A synod in 1074 renewed the decrees of 1059; Gregory sent
these to all the bishops of Europe with a stem command to promulgate and
enforce them; and absolved the laity from obedience to priests who
disregarded them. The reaction was again violent. Many priests declared
that they would abandon their calling rather than their wives; others
deprecated the decrees as making unreasonable demands on human nature,
and predicted that their enforcement would promote secret promis- cuity.
Bishop Otto of Constance openly favored and protected his married
clergy. Gregory excommunicated him, and absolved his flock from obedi-
ence to him. In 1 075 Gregory took the further step of commanding the
dukes of Swabia and Carinthia, and other princes, to use force, if
necessary, in keep- ing recalcitrant clergy from performing priestly
functions. Several German princes obeyed him; and many priests unwilling
to dismiss their wives were deprived of their parishes. 70 Gregory was
to die without victory; but Urban II, Paschal II, and Calixtus II
reaffirmed and executed his decrees. The Coun- cil of the Lateran in 1 2
1 5 under Innocent III issued a final condemnation, and clerical
marriage slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>The problem of investiture seemed simpler than that of clerical
marriage. Assuming, as kings and popes agreed, that Christ had
established the Church, it seemed clear that her bishops and abbots
should be chosen by churchmen rather than by laymen; and surely it was
scandalous that a king should not only appoint bishops, but (as in
Germany) invest them with the episcopal staff and ring — sacred symbols
of spiritual power. But to the kings an oppo- site conclusion was
equally evident. Admitting, as most German bishops and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 547</p>
<p>abbots would have done, that they had been invested by the king with
lands, revenues, and secular responsibilities, it seemed meet and just,
by feudal law, that these prelates — at least the bishops — should owe
their appointment and temporal allegiance to the king, as they had done
without demurrer under Constantine and Charlemagne. If they were
released from such subordina- tion and loyalty half the land of Germany
— which had by this time been granted to bishoprics and monasteries 80 —
would escape control by the state, and their due and wonted service to
it. The German bishops, and many Lom- bard bishops of German origin and
appointment, suspected that Gregory was seeking to end their relative
ecclesiastical autonomy, and subordinate them completely to the Roman
see. Gregory was willing that the bishops should continue their feudal
obligations to the king , 81 but unwilling that they should surrender
the lands they had received by royal grant ; 82 by the law of the Church
the property of the Church was inalienable. Gregory complained that lay
appointment had begotten most of the simony, worldliness, and im-
morality that had appeared in the German and French episcopates. He felt
that the bishops must be brought under the papal authority, or else the
West- ern, like the Eastern, Church would become a subservient appendage
to the state.</p>
<p>Behind this historic conflict lay the question of papacy versus
empire: which should unify and govern Europe? The German emperors
claimed that their power was also divine, as being a necessity of social
order; had not St. Paul said that “the powers that be are ordained by
God”? Were they not, according to the popes themselves, the heirs of the
Empire of Rome? They stood for the freedom of the part as Gregory stood
for the unity and order of the whole. Privately they resented — so long
before the Reformation — the flow of gold in fees and Pet er’s pence
from Germany to Italy ; 83 and they saw in the papal policy an effort of
Latin Rome to renew its ancient control over what Italy scorned as the
barbarian Teutonic North. They freely ad- mitted the supremacy of the
Church in spiritual matters, but asserted a like supremacy for the state
in temporal or earthly affairs. To Gregory this seemed a disorderly
dualism; spiritual considerations, he felt, should domi- nate material
concerns, as the sun dominates the moon ; 84 the state should be
subordinate to the Church — the City of Man to the City of God — in all
mat- ters involving doctrine, education, morals, justice, or
ecclesiastical organiza- tion. Had not the kings of France and the
emperors of the Holy Roman Empire implicitly admitted that the spiritual
was the source and sovereign of the temporal power by accepting
archiepiscopal or papal anointment or con- secration? The Church, as a
divine institution, merited universal authority; the pope, as the
vicegerent of God, had the right and duty to depose bad kings, and to
confirm or reject the choice made of rulers by men or circum- stance .
85 “Who,” asked Gregory, in a passionate epistle to Bishop Hermann of
Metz, “is ignorant that kings and princes had their origin in those
who,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>ignorant of God, and covering themselves with pride, violence, and
perfidy, in fact nearly every crime . . . claimed to rule over their
peers — i.e., men — in blind lust and intolerable arrogance?” 80 Looking
upon the political division, chaos, and wars of Europe, it seemed to
Gregory that the only escape from that age-old misery was a world order
in which these states should surrender something of their jealous
sovereignty, and acknowledge the pope as their feudal suzerain, the
majestic head of a universal, or at least a European, Chris- tian
Republic.</p>
<p>The first step toward this end was the liberation of the papacy from
Ger- man control. The second was to bring all bishops under the
authority of the papal see, at least to this degree, that the bishop
should be chosen by the clergy and people of the diocese under the
auspices of a bishop nominated by the pope or the metropolitan, and that
the election should be valid only when confirmed by the archbishop or
the pope. 87 Gregory began with a letter (1073) to the bishop of
Chalons, in which he threatened to excommunicate King Philip Augustus of
France for selling bishoprics. In 1074 he sent a gen- eral letter to the
French episcopate calling upon them to denounce the crimes of the King
to his face, and to discontinue all religious services in France should
Philip refuse to reform. 88 Lay investiture continued there neverthe-
less, but the French bishops proceeded with caution, and left the issue
to be fought out in Germany.</p>
<p>In February, 1075, a synod of Italian bishops at Rome, under the lead
of Gregory, issued decrees against simony, clerical marriage, and lay
investi- ture. With strange precipitance, Gregory at once excommunicated
for simony five bishops who were councilors of Henry IV ; he suspended
the bishops of Pavia and Turin, deposed the bishop of Piacenza, and
ordered Bishop Hermann of Bamberg to come to Rome to clear himself from
charges of simony. When Hermann tried to bribe the papal tribunal
Gregory uncere- moniously deposed him. He politely asked Henry to
nominate a fit successor for the Bamberg see; Henry not only nominated a
court favorite, but in- vested him with episcopal ring and staff without
waiting for papal approval — a proce dure accordant with custom, but
openly defiant of the Roman synod’s decree. As if to make still clearer
his rejection of Gregory’s demands, Henry appointed bishops to the sees
of Milan, Fermo, and Spoleto — almost under the nose of the Pope — and
kept in his favor the excommunicated councilors.</p>
<p>In December, 1075, Gregory sent Henry a letter of remonstrance, and
commissioned the bearers to add an oral message threatening to
excommuni- cate the King should he continue to ignore the Roman synod’s
decrees. Henry summoned a council of German bishops to Worms (January
24,</p>
<p>1076); twenty-four came, some stayed away. Before this assembly Hugh,
a Roman cardinal, accused Gregory of licentiousness, cruelty, and
witchcraft, and of obtaining the papacy by bribery and violence; and he
reminded the bishops that the custom of centuries required, for the
election of any pope,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 549</p>
<p>the consent of the German emperor — which Gregory had not asked. The
Emperor, emboldened by his recent suppression of a Saxon revolt,
proposed the deposition of the Pope; all bishops present signed the
decree; a council of Lombard bishops at Piacenza approved it; and Henry
sent it to Gregory with a choice superscription: “Henry, King not by
usurpation but by God’s ordi - nance, to Hildebrand, not Pope but false
monk.” 89 The message was deliv - ered to Gregory at a synod in Rome
(February 21, 1076); the 1 10 bishops there present, all from Italy and
Gaul, wished to kill the messenger, but Gregory protected him. The synod
excommunicated the bishops who had signed the Worms decree; and the Pope
launched upon the Emperor a triple sentence of excommunication,
anathema, and deposition, and released Henry’s subjects from their oaths
of obedience (Feb ruary 22, 1076) . Henry countered by persuading the
bishop of Utrecht to anathematize Gregory — “the perjured monk”— from
the pulpit of the cathedral. All Europe was shocked by the papal
deposition of an emperor, and still more by the imperial deposition, and
episcopal cursing, of a pope. The religious sentiment proved stronger
than the national, and public support rapidly deserted the Emperor.
Saxony resumed its revolt; and when Henry summoned the bishops and
nobles of his realm to councils at Worms and Mainz his call was almost
uni- versally ignored. On the contrary the German aristocracy, seeing in
the situ- ation a chance to strengthen their feudal power against the
King, met at Tribur (October 16, 1076), approved the excommunication of
the Em- peror, and declared that should he not obtain absolution from
the Pope by February 22, 1077, they would name a successor to his
throne. It was ar- ranged between the nobles and the papal legates at
Tribur that a diet should be held at Augsburg on February 2, 1077, under
the presidency of the Pope, to settle the affairs of the Church and the
kingdom.</p>
<p>Henry retired to Speyer, defeated and almost entirely deserted.
Believing that the proposed diet would confirm his deposition, he sent
messengers to Rome, offering to come there and ask for absolution.
Gregory replied that as he would soon leave for Augsburg he could not
receive Henry at Rome. En route north, the Pope was entertained at
Mantua by his friend and sup- porter Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. Here
he learned that Henry had en- tered Italy. Fearing that the King would
raise an army among the antipapal population of Lombardy, Gregory took
refuge in Matilda’s fortified castle at Canossa, high in the Apennines
near Reggio Emilia! There on January 25, 1077, at the height of one of
the severest winters that Italy could recall, Henry, says Gregory’s
report to the German princes,</p>
<p>came in person to Canossa . . . bringing with him only a small
retinue. . . . He presented himself at the gate of the castle, barefoot
and clad only in wretched woolen garments, beseeching us with fears to
grant him absolution and forgiveness. This he continued to do for
three</p>
<p>days, while all those about us were moved to compassion at his
plight,</p>
<p>55 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>and interceded for him with tears and prayers. … At length we re-</p>
<p>moved the excommunication from him, and received him again into the
bosom of Holy Mother Church. 90</p>
<p>Gregory hesitated so long through no hardness of heart. He had agreed
to make no peace with Henry without consulting the German princes; and
he knew that if Henry, forgiven, should rebel again, a second
excommunication would have diminished effect, and might receive less
support from the no- bility; on the other hand the Christian world would
have found it hard to understand why the Vicar of Christ should refuse
forgiveness to so humble a penitent. The event was a spiritual triumph
for Gregory, but a subtle diplo- matic victory for Henry, who now
automatically regained his throne. Gregory returned to Rome, and devoted
himself for the next two years to ecclesiastical legislation chiefly
aimed to enforce clerical celibacy. The Ger- man princes, however,
proclaimed Rudolf of Swabia King of Germany (1077), and Henry’s strategy
seemed to have failed. But now that he had freed himself from the papal
ban he found fresh sympathy from a people not enamored of the nobility;
a new army was recruited to defend him; and for two years the rival
kings ravaged Germany in civil war. Gregory, after long vacillation,
gave his support to Rudolf, excommunicated Henry a second time, forbade
Christians to serve him, and offered absolution from their sins to all
who should enlist under Rudolf’s flag (March, 1080) . 91</p>
<p>Henry acted precisely as before. He called a council of favorable
nobles and bishops at Mainz; the council deposed Gregory; a council of
bishops from Germany and northern Italy at Brixen confirmed the
deposition, de- clared Archbishop Guibert of Ravenna Pope, and
commissioned Henry to execute its decrees. The rival armies met on the
banks of the Saale in Saxony (October 15, 1080) ; Henry was defeated,
but Rudolf was killed. While the rebel nobles divided on the question of
a successor to Rudolf, Henry entered Italy, marched unresisted through
Lombardy, recruiting another army as he went, and laid siege to Rome.
Gregory appealed to Robert Guiscard for help, but Robert was far away.
The Pope appealed to William I, whose conquest of England he had
sanctioned and helped, but William was not sure that he wanted Henry to
lose this royal argument. The people of Rome defended the Pontiff
bravely, but Henry was able to seize a large part of Rome, includ- ing
St. Peter’s, and Gregory fled to the Castello Sant’ Angelo. A synod in
the Lateran palace, at Henry’s command, deposed and excommunicated</p>
<p>But in 1085 Robert Guiscard, leaving his campaign against Byzantium,
approached Rome at the head of 36,000 men. Henry had no army to resist
such a force; he fled to Germany, Robert entered the capital, freed
Gregory, sacked Rome, left half of it in ruins, and took Gregory to
Monte Cassino; the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) CHRISTIANITY IN CONFLICT 55 1</p>
<p>populace of Rome was so infuriated against the Normans that the Pope,
their ally, could not r’emain there in safety. Clement returned to Rome
as apparent Pope. Gregory went on to Salerno, held another synod,
excommunicated Henry again, and then broke down in body and spirit. “I
have loved right - eousness,” he said, “and hated iniquity; therefore 1
die in exile.” He was only sixty-two; but the nervous strain of his
bitter controversies had worn him out; and his apparent defeat by the
man whom he had forgiven at Canossa left him no will to live. There at
Salerno, May 25, 1085, he died.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had loved righteousness too imperiously, and had hated
iniquity too passionately; it is reserved to the philosopher, and
forbidden to the man of action, to see elements of justice in the
position of his enemy. Innocent III, a century later, would realize a
large part of Gregory’s dream of a world united under the Vicar of
Christ; but he would win in a more tempferate spirit and with wiser
diplomacy. And yet Innocent’s victory was made pos - sible by Gregory’s
defeat. Hildebrand had grasped higher than his reach, but he had for a
decade raised the papacy to the greatest height and power that it had
yet known. His uncompromising war against clerical marriage suc- ceeded,
and prepared for his successors a clergy whose undivided loyalty
immeasurably strengthened the Church. His campaign against simony and
lay investiture would win a tardy victory, but in the end his view would
pre- vail, and the bishops of the Church would become the willing
servitors of the papacy. His use of papal legates was destined to extend
the power of the popes into every parish in Christendom. Through his
initiative papal elec- tions were now free from royal domination. They
would soon give the Church an amazing succession of strong men; and ten
years after Gregory’s death the kings and nobles of the world would
acknowledge Urban II as the head of Europe in that synthesis of
Christianity, feudalism, chivalry, and im- perialism which we know as
the Crusades.</p>
