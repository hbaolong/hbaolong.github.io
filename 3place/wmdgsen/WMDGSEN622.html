<h4 id="chapter-xxvii-austria">CHAPTER XXVII Austria</h4>
<p>1780 — 1812</p>
<p>I. ENLIGHTENED DESPOTS: 1780-92</p>
<p>I N 1789 Austria was one of the major states of Europe, proud of its
his- tory, its culture, and its power, with an empire far wider than its
name. That name, from Auster, the south wind, justly conveyed the sense
of a people Teutonically tough but good-natured and good-humored,
sharing happily the joie de vivre and music madness of Italy. It had
been a Celtic na- tion when, shortly before Christ, the Romans conquered
it, and it seemed to have retained, across two millenniums, some Celtic
vivacity and wit. At Vindobona (which became Vienna and then Wien) the
Romans built an outpost of their civilization against intrusive
barbarians; there Marcus Au- relius, between golden thoughts, held back
the Marcomanni about a.d. 170; there Charlemagne placed the East Mark,
or eastern boundary, of his realm; there in 955 Otto the Great set up
his Osterreich, or Eastern Kingdom, against the Magyars; and there in
1278 Rudolf of Hapsburg established the rule of a dynasty that continued
till 1918. In 1618-48 the south wind blew strongly Catholic, leading the
old faith against the new in thirty years of war; and that faith was
fortified when, in 1683, Vienna for a second time served as a bulwark of
Christendom, throwing back the Turks. Meanwhile the Hapsburg monarchy
spread the rule of Austria over the adjacent duchies of Styria,
Carinthia, Carniola, and the Tirol; over Bohemia (Czechoslo- vakia),
Transylvania (Romania), Hungary, Polish Galicia, Lombardy, and the
Spanish Netherlands (Belgium). Such was the scattered realm that Eu-
rope knew as the Austrian Empire when, in 1797, Napoleon first knocked
at Vienna’s gates.</p>
<p>The Hapsburg dynasty reached its final peak in the reign of Maria</p>
<p>Theresa (r. 1740-80), that willful and wonderful matriarch who
rivaled Catherine II and Frederick the Great among the monarchs of her
time. She lost Silesia to Frederick’s Machiavellian grasp, but
thereafter, with her peo - ple and her allies, she fought him to a
deadlock of exhaustion. Surviving that conflict, she lived to place five
of her sixteen children upon thrones: Joseph in Vienna, Leopold in
Tuscany, Maria Amalia in Parma, Maria Carolina in Naples, Marie
Antoinette in France. She reluctantly transmitted her realm to her
oldest son, for she distrusted his agnosticism and reforms, and foresaw
that her people, immovably in love with her, would be unhappy under any
disturbance of their traditional beliefs and ways.</p>
<p>558</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII )</p>
<p>AUSTRIA</p>
<p>559</p>
<p>Her judgment seems justified by the troubles that bewildered Joseph,
who shared the throne with her from 1765 to 1780, and then held it for
ten years more. He shocked the aristocracy by freeing the serfs, and
shocked the strongly Catholic population by flirting with Voltaire,
allowing Protes- tant worship, and harassing Pius VI. Unsupported by the
bureaucracy that enveloped him, he had to confess, in his last days,
that the peasants, suddenly separated from their feudal lords, had made
a mess of their liberty; that he had disrupted the economy; that he had
driven the upper classes in Hungary and the Austrian Netherlands to
revolt, threatening the very existence of the Empire. His purposes were
benevolent, but his methods were to rule by in- numerable decrees which
dictated the end without preparing the means. Freder ick the Great said
of him: “He invariably takes the second step before he takes the first.”
1 He died (February 20, 1790) regretting his impetuous procedure, and
mourning the popular conservatism that loved habit too much to bear
reform.</p>
<p>His brother Leopold shared his aims but avoided his haste. Though he
was only eighteen when made grand duke of Tuscany (1765), he tempered
his power with caution, gathered about him mature Italians (e.g., Cesare
Beccaria) familiar with the people, needs, and possibilities of the
duchy, and, with their help, gave his historic realm a government that
was the envy of Europe. When the death of his brother raised him to
imperial leadership he had had twenty- five years of experience. He
moderated some of Joseph’s reforms, and canceled others, but fully
acknowledged the obligation of an “enlightened despot” to raise the
educational and economic opportunities of his people. He withdrew the
Austrian Army from Joseph’s ill -considered attack on Turkey, and, with
some use of it, persuaded Belgium to return to the Austrian allegiance.
He pacified the Hungarian nobles by recognizing the national authority
of their Diet and constitution. He appeased the Bo- hemians by restoring
to Prague the crown of Bohemia’s ancient kings, and accepting coronation
there in St. Vitus’ Cathedral. He knew that in govern - ment the
substance can be withdrawn if the form is retained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he resisted the attempt of French emigres and European
kings to involve him in war with Revolutionary France. He felt for the
plight of his younger sister, Marie Antoinette, but he feared that war
with France would mean his loss of still unreconciled Belgium.
Nevertheless, when the</p>
<p>flight of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette was stopped at Varennes, and
they were led back to Paris to live in daily danger of their lives,
Leopold proposed to his fellow monarchs that they take united action to
control the Revolution. Frederick William II of Prussia met with Leopold
at Pillnitz, and signed with him a declaration (August 27, 1791)
threatening interven- tion in France. Louis XVI made this awkward by
accepting the Revolution- ary constitution (September 13). But disorder
continued and rose, again endangering King and Queen; Leopold ordered
the mobilization of the Aus- trian Army; the French Assembly demanded an
explanation; Leopold died (March 1, 1792) before the message arrived.
His son and successor, Em-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>peror Francis II, aged twenty-four, rejected the ultimatum; and on
April 20 France declared war.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FRANCIS II</li>
</ol>
<p>That story has been told from the French corner; how did the
Austrians view it and feel it? They heard of their Archduchess — whose
beauty had sent Edmund Burke into a delirium of eloquence — being
scorned by the Parisians as “L’Autrichienne,” being in effect imprisoned
in the Tuileries by the mob, and then deposed and imprisoned by the
Assembly. They heard of the September Massacres, and how the severed
head of the Princesse de Lamballe was paraded on a pike in view of the
Queen who had loved her. They heard of her, white-haired, riding captive
in a tumbril through a taunting crowd to her death under the guillotine.
Nothing more was needed to make the people of Austria rally to the young
Emperor who was to lead them in war against those French murderers. It
did not matter that he was a middling mind, a bungling though benevolent
despot, choosing incompetent generals, losing battle after batde,
surrendering part after part of the body of Austria, and leaving his
capital to the mercy and use of the conqueror. These defeats°made the
Austrians love Francis all the more; he seemed to them their appointed
ruler by divine right, by papal consecration, and by the unchallenged
legitimacy of royal descent; and he was defending them as well as he
could against murderous barbarians and then against a Corsican devil.
His repudiation of every liberal measure left by his uncle and his
father, his restoration of feudal dues and the corvee, his rejection of
any move away from autocracy to constitutional government — all this
seemed for- gotten when, after Austerlitz and Pressburg, he reentered
his capital beaten and despoiled. He was acclaimed with wild devotion by
his people. 2 In all the crowded events of the next eight years they saw
only the triumph of the wicked, and the scandalous humiliation of a
God-given ruler, who, as surely as Go d existed, would in due time be
revenged upon Austria’s enemies, and be restored to his full birthright
of possessions and power.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>METTERNICH</li>
</ol>
<p>The man who guided him to that fulfillment was born at Coblenz on the
Rhine May 15, 1773, and was christened Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Met-
ternich. He was the eldest son of Prince Franz Georg Karl von
Metternich, Austria’s representative at the courts of the Prince
-Archbishop Electors of Trier, Mainz, and Cologne. The boy received his
first two names from the first of these ecclesiastical rulers, and he
never forgot his religious connec- tions and loyalties through all his
Voltairean youth and Machiavellian minis- tries. He was given also the
name Lothar to remind Europe that an ancestor so called had ruled Trier
in the seventeenth century. Sometimes he added</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII )</p>
<p>AUSTRIA</p>
<p>561</p>
<p>“Winneburg Beilstein” to indicate the properties that had belonged to
the family for eight centuries, and whose seventy-five square miles
provided ground for the noble preposition von. Obviously he was not made
to love or guide revolutions.</p>
<p>He received the education normal to his status from a tutor who
initiated him into the French Enlightenment, 3 and then from the
University of Stras- bourg. When this institution felt some tremors from
the fall of the Bastille, Klemens was transferred to the University of
Mainz, where he studied law as the science of property and precedent. In
1794 the French seized Coblenz as a hive of buzzing emigres , an d
nearly all the Metternich estates were “na - tionalized.” The family
found refuge and comfort in Vienna. Tall, athletic, elegant, Klemens
wooed and won Eleonore von Kaunitz, rich granddaughter of the statesman
who had married Hapsburg Austria to Bourbon France. Almost inheriting
from his bride the diplomatic arts of noncommittal cour- tesy and of
gracing appropriation with righteousness, he was soon fit for stratagems
and spoils.</p>
<p>In 1801, aged twenty-eight, he was appointed minister to the court of
Saxony. There he met Friedrich von Gentz, who became his mentor and
mouthpiece for the next thirty years, arming him with the most telling
argu- ments for the status quo ante revolution. Faithful to the mores of
the Ancien Regime, he took a mistress, Katharina Bagration, the
eighteen-year-old daughter of a Russian general whom we shall meet
again. In 1802 she bore Klemens a daughter, who was acknowledged to be
his by his wife. 4 Im- pressed by his progress, Vienna promoted him
(1803) to the Austrian Em- bassy at Berlin. During his three years in
Prussia he met Czar Alexander I, and formed with him a friendship that
lasted till they had overthrown Na- poleon. This, however, was not in
Bonaparte’s vision when, after Auste rlitz, he asked the Austrian
government to send him “a Kaunitz” as ambassador to France. Count
Philipp von Stadion, then head of the Foreign Ministry, sent him
Metternich. The thirty-three-years-young Kaunitz-in-law reached Paris on
August 2, 1806.</p>
<p>Now began a nine-year battle of wits between diplomacy and war, in
which the diplomat won by the cooperation of the general. For relaxation
from encounters with Napoleon’s penetrating eyes— and finding his
illustri- ous wife intellectually unstimulating and physically toujours
la meme — Met- ternich amused himself with Mme. Laure Junot, wife of the
then governor of Paris. But he did not forget that he was expected to
probe Napoleon’s mind, discover his aims, and explore all possibilities
of guiding them to Aus- tria’s advantage. Each man admired the other.
Napoleon, Metternich wrote</p>
<p>He spent some three years as ambassador in Paris. He saw with
concealed satisfaction the ensnarement of the Grande Armee in Spain. He
tried and failed to hide from Napoleon the rearming of Austria for
another attempt to unseat him. He left Paris on May 25, 1809, joined
Francis II at the front,</p>
<p>56 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>and witnessed the Austrian defeat at Wagram. Stadion, his martial
venture thwarted, resigned his leadership of policy. Francis offered the
post to Met- ternich, and on October 8, 1809, Metternich, aged
thirty-six, began his thirty- nine years’ career as minister of the
imperial household and of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>In January, 1810, General Junot found in his wife’s desk some love
let - ters from Metternich. He nearly strangled her, and vowed he would
chal- lenge the mettlesome Minister to meet him in a duel at Mainz.
Napoleon ended the fracas by dispatching the general and his wife to
Spain. The story apparently did no damage to Metternich’s reputation,
nor to his marriage, nor to his position in the Austrian government. He
shared in arranging the marriage of Napoleon with the Austrian
Archduchess Marie Louise. He was delighted to hear that this sudden
rapprochement between France and Aus- tria had angered Russia. He
watched the tension grow between those op- posed nuclei of European
force. He hoped and planned that some weakening of both empires would
let Austria regain the lands she had lost, and the high place she had
held in the clashing concert of the Powers.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>VIENNA</li>
</ol>
<p>Behind the walls of war lived the peaceable and amiable people of
Vienna, a reasonably tolerant mixture of Germans, Hungarians, Czechs,
Slovaks, Croats, Moravians, French, Italians, Poles, and Russians —
190,000 souls. The great majority were Roman Catholic, and, when they
could, worshiped the city’s patron saint in St. Stephen’s Church. The
streets were mostly narrow, but there were some spacious and well-paved
boulevards. A congeries of majestic buildings focused on the palatial
Schonbrunn, which housed the Emperor, his family, and the main offices
of the government. The “blue” Danube passed along the edge of the city,
carrying commerce and pleasure in amiable confusion. Sloping toward the
river, the park called the Prater (meadow) gave old and young a place
for carriage drives or promenades. And just outside the city gates the
Wienerwald, or Vienna Woods, invited those lucky walkers who loved trees
and trysts, the smell of foliage, the song and chatter of winged
residents.</p>
<p>All in all the Viennese were a docile and well-behaved people, quite
un- like the Parisians, who, with or without revolution, lived on
excitement, re- sented marriage, hated their nobles, suspected their
King, and doubted God. There were nobles here too, but they danced and
musicked in their palaces, respected pedestrians, indulged in no
snobbery, and died gallantly, however ineffectually, before Napoleon’s
businesslike warriors. Class consciousness was keenest in the upper
middle class, which was making fortunes by supply- ing the Army, or
lending to aristocrats impoverished by a feudalism without stimulus, or
to a state always fighting and losing wars.</p>
<p>A proletariat was beginning to form. By 1810 there were over a
hundred factories in or near Vienna, employing in all some 27,000 men
and women,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>AUSTRIA</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>nearly all at wages that sufficed to keep them alive and multiplying.
7 As early as 181 1 there were complaints that oil refineries and
chemical plants were polluting the air. 8 Commerce was developing,
helped by access to the Adriatic at Trieste, and by the Danube that
touched a hundred towns plus Budapest and reached the Black Sea. After
1806 Napoleon’s attempt to ex - clude British goods from the Continent,
and French control of Italy, ham- pered Austrian commerce and industry,
and left hundreds of families to un- employment and penury.</p>
<p>Finance was mostly managed by Jews, who, excluded from agriculture
and most industry, became experts in the handling of money. Some Jewish
bankers in Austria rivaled the Esterhazys in the splendor of their
establish- ments; some became the cherished friends of emperors; some
were honored as saviors of the state. Joseph II ennobled certain Jewish
bankers in appreci- ation of their patriotism. The Emperor liked
especially to visit the home of the financier Nathan von Arnstein, where
he could discuss literature and music with the banker’s pretty wife.
This was the versatile and cultivated</p>
<p>The government was administered by the nobility with middling compe-
tence and inconsiderable honesty. Jeremy Bentham, in a letter of July 7,
1817, mourned this “utter moral rottenness of the Austrian state,” and
he despaired of fi nding “an honorable person.” No commoner could rise
to a commanding post in the armed services or the government;
consequently there was little stimulus to soldiers or bureaucrats to
take pains or risks for promotion’s sake. The ranks of the Army were f
illed by shiftless volunteers, or by conscription through lottery, or by
the impressment of beggars, radi- cals, or criminals; 10 no wonder these
Austrian armies were periodically routed by French legions in which any
private might rise to leadership, and even join Napoleon’s covey of
dukes.</p>
<p>Social order was maintained by the Army, the police, and religious
be- lief. The Hapsburg rulers rejected the Reformation, remained loyal
to the Catholic Church, and depended upon its well-trained clergy to man
the schools, censor the press, and bring up every Christian child in a
creed that sanctified hereditary monarchy as a divine right, and
comforted poverty and grief with the consolations and promises of the
faith. Great fanes like the Stefanskirche and the Karlskirche offered a
ritual solemn with song and censer and collective prayer, and exalted by
Masses that Protestants like Bach and skeptics like Beethoven were eager
to provide. Religious proces- sions periodically brought drama to the
streets, renewing the public mem- ory of martyrs and saints, and
celebrating the merciful mediation of Vien- na’s queen, the Virgin
Mother. Aside from the disciplinary fear of hell, and some unpleasant
pictures of saintly tortures, it was as comforting a religion as has
ever been offered to mankind.</p>
<p>Education, primary and secondary, was left to the Church. The Univer-
sities of Vienna, Ingolstadt, and Innsbruck were manned by learned
Jesuits. The press was strictly controlled; all Voltaireana were stopped
at the na- tion’s borders or the city gates. Freethinkers were rarities.
Some Freemason</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>lodges had survived Maria Theresa’s attempt to destroy them; but they
con - fined themselves to a moderate anticlericalism which even a good
Catholic might allow, and a program of social reform which an emperor
could en- dorse. So Mozart, a firm Catholic, was a Freemason; and Joseph
II joined the secret order, approved the principles of reform, and made
some of them laws. A more radical secret society, the Illuminati — which
Adam Weishaupt, an ex-Jesuit, had founded at Ingolstadt in 1776 —
survived, but in com- parative decay. Leopold II renewed h is mother’s
prohibition of all secret societies.</p>
<p>The Church accomplished well the task of training the people to
patrio- tism, charity, social order, and sexual restraint. Mme. de Stael
reported in 1804: “You never met a beggar…. The charitable e
stablishments are regu- lated with great order and liberality.
Everything bears the mark of a paren- tal, wise, and religious
government.” 11 Sexual morals were fairly firm among the commonalty,
much looser in the upper classes, where the men had mis- tresses and the
wives had lovers. Beethoven, Thayer tells us, protested against “the
practice, not uncommon in the Vienna of his time, of living with an
unmarried woman as a wife.” 12 But family unity was usual, and parental
authority was maintained. Manners were genial, and gave little wel- come
to revolutionary sentiments. Beethoven wrote, on August 2, 1794: “It is
my belief that as long as the Austrian has his dark beer and sausage he
will not revolt.” 13</p>
<p>The typical Viennese preferred to be entertained rather than
reformed. He readily surrendered his kreuzers or groschen (pennies) for
simple amuse- ments, such as watching Niklos Roger, “the incombustible
Spaniard,” who claimed to be immune to fire. 14 If he could spare a bit
more he might play billiards or bowl. Vienna and its outskirts abounded
in cafes — so called from the coffee that was now rivaling beer as the
favorite drink. These were the clubs of the poor; Viennese of ascending
status went to Bierhallen, which had gardens and fine rooms; the
well-to-do could lose their money in gambling halls, or go to a
masquerade ball — perhaps in the Redoutensaal, where hundreds of couples
could dance at the same time. Even before the days of Johann Strauss
(1804-49) the men and women of Vienna lived to dance. The restrained and
stately minuet was yielding to the waltz; now the man might enjoy
electric contact with his severed half, and lead her into the exciting
whirl that had given the dance its name. The Church protested, and
forgave.</p>
<p>V. THE ARTS</p>
<p>The theater flourished in Vienna, in all degrees from twopenny
sketches on impromptu stages to classic dramas in sumptuous housing and
decor. The oldest regular playhouse was the Kamtnerthor, which had been
built by the municipality in 1708; here the actor-playwright Joseph
Anton Stranitsky</p>

and de- veloped the character of Hanswurst, or John Boloney, the
hilarious buffoon in whom the Germans, north and south, satirized their
own beloved absurdi- ties. In 1776 Joseph II sponsored and financed the
Burgtheater, whose classic fagade promised the best ancient and modem
plays. Most sumptuous of all was the Theater-an-der-Wien (on the River
Wien), built in 1793 by Johann Emanuel Schikaneder, who wrote the
libretto for — and acted Papageno in —Mozart’s Magic Flute (1791). He
equipped his theater with eve ry me- chanical device known to the scene
shifters of his time; he astonished his audiences with dramatic
spectacles outmatching reality; and he won for his playhouse the
distinction of presenting the premiere of Beethoven’s Fidelio.</p>
<p>Only one art now rivaled drama in Vienna. It was not architecture,
for Austria had finished by 1789 its golden age of baroque. It was not
literature, for the Church weighed too heavily on the wings of genius,
and the age of Grillparzer (1791-1872) had yet to come. In Vienna, Mme.
de Stael re- ported, “the people read little”; 13 as in some cities
today a daily newspaper supplied their literary needs; and both the
Wiener Zeitung and the Wiener Zeitschrift were excellent.</p>
<p>Of course the supreme art of Vienna was music. In Austria and Germany
— as befitted a people who cherished the home as the fount and citadel
of civilization — music was more a domestic and amateur art than a
public per- formance by professionals. Almost every educated family had
musical in- struments, and some could offer a quartet. Now and then a
concert was organized for prepaying subscribers, but concerts open to
the general pub- lic for an admission charge were rare. Even so, Vienna
was crowded with musicians, who starved one another by their number.</p>
<p>How did they survive? Mostly by accepting invitations to perform in
private homes, or by dedicating their compositions — with or without
pre- arranged payment — to wealthy nobles, clerics, or businessmen. The
love, practice, and patronage of music had been a tradition with
Hapsburg rulers for two centuries; it was actively continued in this
period by Joseph II, Leo- pold II, and Leopold’s youngest son, the
Archduke Rudolf (1788 -1831), who was both a pupil and a patron of
Beethoven. The Esterhazy family pro- vided a succession of generations
supporting music; we have seen Prince Miklos Jozsef Esterhazy (1714-90)
keeping Haydn for thirty years as con- ductor of the orchestra
maintained in the Schloss Esterhazy, the “Versailles of Hungary.” His
grandson Prince Miklos Nicolaus Esterhazy (1765 -1833) engaged Beethoven
to compose music for the family orchestra. Prince Karl Lichnowsky
(1753-1814) became an intimate friend and patron of Beetho- ven, and for
a time gave him lodging in his palace. Prince Jose Fran Lob- kowitz, of
an old Bohemian family, shared with Archduke Rudolf and Count Kinsky the
honor of subsidizing Beethoven till his death. To these we should add
Baron Gottfried van Swieten (1734 — 1803), who helped mu- sicians not so
much with money as with his energy and skill in getting engagements and
patrons; he opened London to Haydn and received the</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>dedication of Beethoven’s First Symphony; and he founded in Vienna
the Musikalische Gesellschaft — twenty-five nobles pledged to help
bridge the gaps between composers, music publishers, and audiences. It
was in part due to such men that the most disagreeable composer in
history survived to make himself the unchallenged music master of the
nineteenth century.</p>
