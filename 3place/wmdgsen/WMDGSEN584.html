<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>Henry IV</p>
<p>1553-1610</p>
<p>I. LOVE AND MARRIAGE</p>
<p>H ENRY’S grandmother was Marguerite of Angouleme, Valois, and</p>
<p>Navarre, the lovable, sensitive, pious sister of the amorous,
gallant,</p>
<p>dashing Francis I. His mother was the rebellious, unmanageable,
heretical Jeanne d’Albret. His father, Antoine de Bou rbon, a descendant
of St. Louis, was handsome, brave, debonair, vain, with a tendency to
fluctuate from creed to creed. When Henry struggled into the world
(December</p>
<ol start="1553" type="1">
<li>3 t Pau in Bearn, he may have carried in him all these ancestral
qualities except piety. His happy grandfather, sure that it would be a
fine omen, persuaded Jeanne, in her pains, to sing a song to the Virgin;
and, as a baptism into Bearn, he rubbed the lips of the babe with garlic
and made him drink wine. The hero sucked eight nurses dry.</li>
</ol>
<p>He did not relish education. He disliked writing, fied from grammar,
and learned to write a fascinating style. He read Plutarch as his bible
of heroism. He was brought up almost wholly out of doors; majored in
running, romping, wrestling, riding, pommeling; ate black bread, cheese
and onions; enjoyed summer and winter with a relish that laughed pes-
simism out of face. He was reared as a Huguenot, but he never allowed
religion to hobble life. Summoned at the age of nine to live at the
court and learn its graces and morals, he readily adopted Catholicism;
returning to Bearn at thirteen, he resumed the Huguenot faith as if he
were adjusting his clothes to the climate. With greater facility he
passed from love to love — La Petite Tignonville, Mile, de Montagu,
Arnaudine, La Garce (the Wench), Catherine de Luc, Anne de Cambefort. He
molted creeds and mistresses without distressing his conscience or
shifting his aim.</p>
<p>His aim was to be king of France. At nineteen, his father having
died, Henry became King of Navarre, but that was only a teasing taste
of</p>
<p>royalty. When he went to Paris to marry Marguerite of Valois, he was
received as next only to the Duke of Anjou and the Duke of Alengon in
line for the throne. When massacre followed on marriage, he kept and
saved his head by timely apostasy.</p>
<p>His bride, “Margot,” was the most fascinating and accommodating</p>
<p>woman in France. No one questioned her beauty; Ronsard sang it; Bran-
tome intoned ecstasies about her fine cosmetic skin, her waving hair
or</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>varied wigs, her eyes darting humor, anger, or deviltry, her figure
shapely as a courtesan’s and stately as a queen’s, her lively feet
leading the dances of the court, her contagion of vivacity in an age of
strife and gloom; all these magnets drew a dozen lovers to her lair, and
gossip credited her with tactful, even incestuous, capitulations.^ Henry
could hardly complain, having himself a roving eye; but when Margot, who
had married him against her will, resumed her fluctuations after a brief
obeisance to</p>
<p>monogamy, he began to wonder who would be the father of his children.
He took a mistress; he fell ill; Margot generously nursed him, though
she asc ribed his disorder to “excesses with women.” But soon their
mutual suspicion so estranged them that she wrote, “Near ne couchions
plus, ni ne parlions plus ensemble’’ (We neither slept nor spoke with
each other any more).^</p>
<p>For three years he remained unwillingly at the court. One night
(1575), while hunting, he galloped out of bounds; then he fled in
disguise across France, found his way through a dozen perils to Nerac,
and governed Bearn and Guienne with justice and wit. He abandoned
Catholicism, re- stored the Protestants to power in Beam, and protected
them in Guienne. Three years later Margot joined him, and the young
King, when not</p>
<p>following the hunt or fighting Catholics, helped her to make the
festivities of her little court outface their infidelities. In 1582,
tired of helping his mistresses in their confinements, she returned to
Paris; but there her esca- pades were so flagrant that her brother,
Henry III, bade her hurry back to her husband. After two years more in
Beam she retired to Agen. The two kings — now two Henrys — agreed to her
practical imprisonment in the Chateau d’Usson, and allowed her a fair
pension (1587 -1605). She turned her prison into a salon, entertained
poets, artists, scholars, and lovers, and composed her gossipy memoirs.
Richelieu commended her style, Montaigne dedicated essays to her,
preachers praised her charity. After substantial in- ducements she
consented to an annulment of her marriage, and was allowed to return to
Paris and the court (1605). There she resumed her romances and her
salon, became fat and penitent, took Vincent de Paul as her chap- lain,
founded a convent, and died in peace and piety (1615) at the age of
sixty-two. So e nded, said a contemporary, “Marguerite, sole remains of
the</p>
<p>H. HENRY m: 1574-89</p>
<p>The Duke of Anjou, after a brief tenure of the Polish throne,
returned, aged twenty-four, to be Henry III, the last Valois king of
France. An</p>
<p>anonymous portrait in the Louvre shows him tall, lank, pale, wistful
—</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>a man of good will confused by bad heredity. He was physically weak,
emotionally unstable, easily fatigued; he had to avoid riding and hunt-
ing, and a few minutes of active love left him bedded for days. His skin
itched incurably, his head and stomach ached, his ear ran. Before he was
thirty-six his hair was white and his teeth were gone. His apparent
haughti- ness was really diffidence, his cruelty was fear; normally he
was gentle and cautious. Unfortunately, he had a passion for feminine
raiment. He ap- peared at a ball in a low-necked dress, with a circlet
of pearls around his throat; he wore jewels on his ears and bracelets on
his arms. He gathered about him a dozen mignons, youths who frizzed
their long hair, painted their faces, adorned themselves with fancy
garb, and sprinkled themselves with perfumes that scented their trail.
With these uncertain men he would on occasion — disguised as a woman —
romp through the streets at night, playing pranks upon the citizens. In
a country nearing bankruptcy and anarchy he emptied the treasury upon
his male favorites, spending eleven million francs on the wedding of
one, and doubling the price of judgeships to buy a marriage gift for
another. Some of his people’s money he spent to good purpose — building
the Pont Neuf, improving the Louvre, and raising parts of Paris out of
squalor into architecture and cleanliness. He supported literature and
the theater. He labored fretfully at administration. To square all his
accounts he made pilgrimages on foot to Chartres and Clery; in Paris he
walked from church to church fingering large rosaries, zealously
accumulating paternosters and Ave Marias; he marched in the ghostly
nocturnal processions of the Blue Penitents, his body enclosed in a sack
with holes for feet and eyes. He had no children. His mother, who had
brought the seeds of degeneracy to him from diseased parents, looked
with sorrow on the decadence and the imminent extinction of her
stock.</p>
<p>The political situation was c onfused beyond Henry’s understanding.
He was not made for war, and Catherine, aging, longed for peace; but the
Huguenots, desperate yet unsubdued, were still in revolt. His brother,
the Duke of Alengon, was flirting with a Protestant queen in England,
with Protestant rebels in the Netherlands, and with Henry of Navarre in
Bearn. A minority of Catholic leaders, called “Politiques” by their
critics, took up the ideas of L’Hopital (who had died in grief in 1573),
proposed mutual toleration between the warring faiths, and defended the
idea, so unpopular in both camps, that a nation could survive without
unity of religious belief. If (they argued) the popes forbade such a
compromise, France should sever its religious bonds with Rome.
Frightened by the co- operation of Politiques and Huguenots, and by the
inroads of German troops coming to reinforce the Protestants, Henry
ended (1576) the Fifth Religious War by signing the “Peace of Monsieur”
at Beaulieu, and issuing an edict of pacification — the Edict of
Beaulieu — which gave the Hugue-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV )</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>nots full freedom of worship everywhere in France, made them eligible
to all offices, and allowed them eight cities in which they were to have
complete political and military dominance.</p>
<p>Most French Catholics, and above all the ardently orthodox populace
of Paris, were shocked by these concessions to a party supposedly
destroyed. In 1562 the Cardinal of Lorraine had proposed a ligue sainte
whose mem- bers should swear to defend the Church by whatever means and
at what- ever cost; Henry of Guise had organized such a band in
Champagne in 1568; now similar associations were formed in many
provinces. In 1576 the Duke openly proclaimed the Holy League, and took
the field with a vow to crush the Huguenots once and for all.</p>
<p>We must not follow the trajectories of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth
Religious Wars except as they affected the flow of ideas or the
character of France. Now again philosophy entered the fray. In 1579 an
unidentified author — perhaps Philippe Duplessis- Mornay, one of
Navarre’s councilors — ^sent out from Basel a stirring pronunciamento
entitled Vindiciae contra</p>
<p>covenant between God, the people, and the king to uphold and obey the
“true religion” — in this case Protestantism; any king failing to do
this may be deposed. Secondly, government is a pact between king and
people: the one to rule justly, the other to obey peaceably. King and
people alike are subject to natural law — that is, a law of reason and
natural justice conformable to the divine moral code and superior to all
“positive” (man - made) law. The function of the king is to maintain the
law, positive, na- tural, and divine; he is the instrument, not the
dictator, of the law. “Sub - jects . . . , considered in a body, ought
to be esteemed absolute lords and owners of the kingdom.” But who shall
determine whether the</p>
<p>king is a tyrant? Not the p eople as a multitude, “that monster with
count - less heads”; rather, let the magistrates decide, or some such
assembly as the States-General of France. It will not do for each
private individual to follow his own conscience; he would mistake his
desires for his con- science, and chaos would ensue; but if the
magistrate summons him to armed rebellion he must obey the call. If
however, the tyrant is a usurper, he may justly be killed by
anyone.^</p>
<p>The conflict of forces and ideas was sharpened when the Duke of</p>
<p>Alenyon died (1584) and Henry III recognized Henry of Navarre as
heir</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xrv</p>
<p>presumptive to the throne. Overnight the Huguenots ceased to talk of
tyranny and deposition and became ardent supporters of legitimacy, ex-
pecting the fragile Valois King to collapse soon and yield France to
their Bourbon Protestant. The Vindiciae, so recently a Huguenot
manifesto, was frowned upon, and Hotman himself proclaimed that
resistance to Henry of Navarre was a sin.® But most of France shuddered
at the thought of a Huguenot king. How could a Protestant be anointed at
Reims by the Church? And could anyone, without such unction, ever be a
rightful monarch of France? The orthodox clergy, led by fervent Jesuits,
de-</p>
<p>nounced the succession and called all Catholics to the League. Henry
III, swept away by the tide, joined the League and ordered all Huguenots
to accept Catholicism or leave France. Henry of Navarre appealed to
Europe to recognize the justice of his cause, but Pope Sixtus V
excommunicated him, and declared that as a persistent heretic he could
not inherit the throne. Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, now declared
himself heir presumptive. Ca- therine again tried for peace, offering to
support Navarre if he would renounce Protestantism; he refused. He took
the field with an army partly Catholic, captured half a dozen cities in
as many months, and defeated at Coutras a League army twice as large as
his own (1587).</p>
<p>The Huguenots, numbering about a twelfth of the population,® now held
half the major towns of France.’^ But Paris was the heart of France, and
Paris was passionately for the League. Dissatisfied w ith Henry Ill’s
halfhearted support, the League set up in the capital a revolutionary
govern- ment composed of representatives from the sixteen wards; the
“Sixteen” negotiated with Spain for a Spanish invasion of England and
France and planned to seize the person of the King. Henry sent for Swiss
guards; the Sixteen called upon the Duke of Guise to take control of
Paris; the King forbade it; the Duke came and was hailed by the populace
as head of the Catholic cause in France. Henry III, humiliated and
vowing vengeance, fled to Chartres. Then, again losing his nerve, he
disowned Henry of Navarre, appointed Henry of Guise commander in chief
of the royal armies, and summoned the States-General to meet at
Blois.</p>
<p>When the delegates assembled, the King noted with anger the almost
royal honors paid to Guise. In a day of frenzied resolution he persuaded
some of his aides to kill the Duke. He invited him to a private
conference; as the young noble approached the King’s room nine
assailants stabbed him to death; and the King, opening a door, gazed in
excited satisfaction upon his accomplished aim (December 24, 1588). He
ordered tbe imprison- ment of tlie League leaders and the death of the
Duke’s brother, the Cardinal of Guise. In pride and terror he reported
his vicarious exploits to his mother. She wrung her hands in despair.
“You have ruined the Icingdom,” she told him.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>Twelve days later she died, aged sixty-nine, worn out with
responsibil- ities, anxieties, intrigues, and probably remorse. Hardly
anyone paused to mourn her. She was buried in a common grave at Blois,
for when a pro- posal was made to let her remains occupy the tomb she
had prepared in St.-Denis, the Sixteen announced that if her body were
brought to Paris they would throw it into the Seine. Half of France
denounced Henry III as a murderer; students paraded the streets
demanding his dethronement; the theologians of the Sorbonne, supported
by the Pope, absolved the people from allegiance to the King, and
priests called for armed resistance to him everywhere. Supporters of the
King were arrested; men and women crowded the churches for fear of being
taken as royalists. The pamphleteers of the League took over the
political ideology of the Huguenots: the people were declared sovereign,
with the right, through the Parlement or the magistrates, to depose a
tyrant; any future king should be subject to constitutional limitations,
and his prime duty should be to enforce the true religion — in this case
Catholicism.®</p>
<p>Henry III, now at Tours with some nobles and soldiers, found himself
between two terrors. The army of the League, under the Duke of Mayenne,
was advancing upon him from the north; the army of Navarre, taking town
after town, was advancing from the south; one or the other force must
capture him. Henry the Huguenot seized his opportunity; he sent Duples-
sis-Mornay to offer the King alliance, protection, and support. At
Plessis- les-Tours the two Henrys met and pledged mutual fidelity (April
30,</p>
<p>1589). Together their armies defeated Mayenne and marched upon
Paris.</p>
<p>In the frenzied capital a Dominican monk, Jacques Clement, listened
fervently to denunciations of Henry III as an assassin. He was assured
that a great deed in a divine cause would clear away all the guilt of
his sins; and the grief and beauty of Catherine, Duchess of Montpensier,
sister of the slain Guises, agitated him. He bought a dagger, found his
way into the royal camp, stabbed the King in the stomach, was killed by
the guards, and died in the confidence of Paradise. Henry of Valois died
on the mor- row (August 2, 1589), beseeching his followers to cleave to
his cousin of Navarre. Chaos swept through the besieging army; much of
it melted away; the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Within the
city the joy of the League and its followers reached delirium. Some
churches placed the monk’s picture on the altar;® dev otees hailed the
assassination as the noblest act of God since the Incarnation of Jesus
Christ.^® Clement’s mother was brought from the provinces, preached in
the churches, and was hailed with a sacred chant: “Blessed be the womb
that bore thee, and the paps that gave thee suck.”^^</p>

<li>THE ROAD TO PARIS: 1 589-94</li>
</ol>
<p>Henry of Navarre was at the crisis of his life. Suddenly he was, in
law and by tradition, King of France; but almost as suddenly half his
troops deserted him. The nobles who had clung to Henry III rode off to
their estates; most of the Catholics in his army disappeared. Two thirds
of France rejected forcibly the notion of a Protestant king. The
Politiques had for the time been silenced by the two assassinations; the
Parlement of Paris recognized Cardinal de Bourbon as king of France;
Philip of Spain pledged to the League the gold of the Americas to keep
France Catholic. Mean- while, not quite to Philip’s chagrin, the
disruption of French production and trade had brought the country to
such desolation that no comfort was left it but the consuming ecstasy of
hate.</p>
<p>It was out of the question for Navarre to attack a city so
overwhelmingly hostile as Paris with an army so disorganized and
reduced. Cautiously, and with a generalship impeded more by his
mistresses than by the enemy, he withdrew his forces northward to
receive help from England, and</p>
<p>Mayenne followed as rapidly as his corpulence would permit. At
Arques, just south of Dieppe, the two armies met, Henry with 7,000 men,
Mayenne with 23,000 (September 2 1, 1 589). We may gather the result
from Henry’s message to his comrade at arms Crillon: “Tends -toi, brave
Crillon; nous avons combattu d Arques, et tu n’y etais pas’’’ (Hang
yourself, brave Cril - lon; we have fought at Arques, and you were not
there). The victory heartened Henry’s secret supporters e verywhere.
Several towns opened their gates to him cheerfully; the Republic of
Venice recognized him as King; Elizabeth, as anxious as Venice to keep
Spain from dominating France, sent him four thousand troops, 2 2,000 in
gold, 70,000 pounds of gunpowder, and cargoes of shoes, food, wine, and
beer. Philip retaliated by sending a detachment from Flanders to
Mayenne. The reinforced armies fought at Ivry, on the Eure, March 14,
1590. Henry stuck a white plume — hardly to be termed a white feather —
^in his helmet and told his soldiers, “If the heat of battle disperse
you for a while, rally . . . under those pear trees you see up yonder to
my right, and if you lose your standards do not lose sight of my white
plume — you will always find it in the path of honor and, I hope, of
victory too.” As usual, he fought in the fore of the fray; his right arm
was swollen and his sword beaten out of shape with the blows they gave.
His reputation for mercy served him well, for thousands of unpaid Swiss
in Mayenn e’s service surrendered. Henry’s vic - tory left the League
without an army; almost unhindered he advanced to besiege Paris
again.</p>
<p>From May to September, 1 590, his hungry and penniless soldiers
camped around the capital, eager to assault and plunder i t, but checked
by Henry’s</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>363</p>
<p>refusal to sanction a slaughter that might have been worse than the
St. Bartholomew. After a month of siege the Parisians were eating
horses, cats, dogs, and grass. Henry relented and let provisions enter
the city. The Duke of Parma, Philip’s governor in the Netherlands, came
to the relief of Paris with a well-equipped army of Spanish veterans;
Henry, outmaneuvered, retreated to Rouen; Parma followed him in a duel
of strategy; sickness dis- abled the Duke, and Henry’s army once more
sat down before the capital.</p>
<p>Now he faced the decisive question: Could he, as a Protestant, win
and keep the throne of a country 90 per cent Catholic? Even his army was
predominantly Catholic. Doubtless it was no small item in his thoughts
that he was running out of funds and could no longer pay his troops. He
called in his aides and confessed that he was thinking of conversion to
Catholicism. Some approved the plan as the only road to peace; some
condemned it as a cruel and scandalous desertion of Huguenots who had
given him blood and money in the hope of having a Protestant king. To
these Henry re- plied, “If I were to follow your advice, in a little
while the re would be neither king nor kingdom in France. I wish to give
peace to my subjects and rest to my soul. Take council among you as to
what you need for your security. I shall always be ready to satisfy
you.”^® He added, “Per - haps between the two religions the difference
is great only through the animosity of those who preach it. Someday, by
my authority, I shall try to arrange all that.”^® And he defined his own
essential faith: “Those who unswervingly follow their conscience are of
my religion, and I am of the religion of all who are brave and good.”^^
Duplessis -Mornay, Agrippa d’Aubigne, and many other Protestant leaders
abandoned the King, but Henry’s most trusted adviser, the Duke of Sully,
while himself remaining staunchly Protestant, agreed with his master’s
decision, “Paris vaut bien une messe“ (Paris is well worth a
Mass).^®</p>
<p>On May 18, 1593, Henry sent word to the Pope and the Paris hierarchy
that he desired instruction in the Catholic faith. Gregory XIV had
renewed his excommunication, but the French hierarchy, never obsequious
to Rome, prepared to groom the new penitent to be a pious king. He was
no easy pupil. He would give no pledge to make war against heresy, and
refused to sign or believe “rubbish which he was quite sure that the
majority of them did not believe” themselves.’® He graciously agreed to
the doctrine of purgatory because “it is the best part of your
revenues.”’^ On July 25 he wrote to his current mistre ss, “〕e vais
faire le saut perilleux“ (I am going to make the perilous leap). He went
to the abbey church of St.-Denis, confessed, received absolution, and
heard Mass.</p>
<p>Thousands of voices, in both camps, denounced him as a hypocrite. The
Jesuits repudiated his conversion, and the League leaders continued to
resist. But the deaths of the Duke of Parma and Cardinal de Bourbon had
weakened the League, and the Sixteen had lost standing with French</p>
<p>364</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>patriots by supporting Philip’s plan to have his daughter made queen
of France. Many of the nobility inclined to Henry as a general who could
keep Philip in check, and as a humane ruler who could restore health to
a land disordered to the verge of dismemberment. A clever periodical,
Satyre Menippee (1593-94), voiced the sentiments of the Politiques and
the bourgeoisie, ridiculed with wit and irony the Jesuits and the
League, and declared, “There is no peace so unjust that it is not worth
more than the most just war.”^® Even fanatical Paris was crying for
peace. Minor hostil - ities continued for eight months more, but on
March 22, 1594, Henry marched into Paris and hardly a man hindered him;
such crowds acclaimed him that when he wished to enter Notre Dame he had
to be lifted over the heads of the multitude. Established as king in the
same Louvre where, twenty-two years before, he had been a prisoner and
near death, he sur- rendered himself to joy, and issued, in his buoyant
way, an amnesty to all, even to the Guises and the Sixteen. Some enemies
he brought over by ready forgiveness and gallant courtesy; some he
bribed with borrowed funds.</p>
<p>Not all were won over. At Lyon Pierre Barriere bought a knife,
had</p>
<p>it sharpened, and started out for Paris proclaiming his intent to
assassinate the King. He was arrested at Melun and summarily strangled.
“Alas,” said Henry, “if I had known it I would have pardoned him.” Pope
Clement VTII sent the King absolution, but the Jesuits continued to
preach against him. On December 27 Jean Chatel, aged nineteen, struck at
the King with a dagger, but inflicted only a cut lip and a broken tooth.
Again Henry pro- posed to pardon the fanatic, but the authorities
subjected Chatel to all the tortures required by the law against
regicides. He proudly admitted his desire to kill the King as a
dangerous heretic, and professed his readiness to make another attempt
for his own salvation’s sake. He c onfessed that he was a pupil of the
Jesuits, but would not further implicate them in his enterprise. The
Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana (whom we shall meet again) was quoted as
having approved the assassination of bad kings, of Henry III especially;
and the French Jesuit Jean Guignard was found to have written that Henry
IV should have been killed in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and that
he ought now to be got rid of “at any price and in any way
whatsoever.”^® Early in 1595 the Parlement of Paris , on petition of the
secular clergy of the Sorbonne, ordered the Jesuits to leave France.</p>

<p>Henry found the task of reconstruction more arduous than the con-
quest of power. Thirty- two years of “religious” wars had le ft
France</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>3&lt;55</p>
<p>almost as devastated and chaotic as after the Hundred Years’ War the
cen - tury before. The French merchant marine had practically vanished
from the seas. Three hundred thousand homes had been destroyed. Hatred
had declared a moratorium on morals and had poisoned France with the
lust for revenge. Demobilized soldiers harried the roads and villages
with robbery and murder. The nobles plotted to exact, as the price of
their loyalty, a return to feudal seignorial sovereignties; the
provinces, long left to their own resources, were dividing France into
autonomous states; and the Huguenots were clamoring for political
independence as well as religious liberty. The League still had a
hostile army in the field; Henry bought its leader, Mayenne, to truce
and finally to peace (January 1596). The terms having been signed, Henry
walked the fat Duke into panting exhaustion, and then assured him that
this was the only revenge he would take.®® When one of his own generals,
Charles de Gontaut, Duke of Biron, led a conspiracy against him, Henry
offered him pardon for a</p>
<p>confession; this being refused, Henry had him tried, convicted, and
be- headed (1602). By this time France realized that Navarre was King.
The people of France, tired of anarchy, allowed him — ^the business
classes begged him — to make the new Bourbon monarchy absolute. Royal
absolutism, which was the cause of civil war in England, was the effect
of civil war in France.</p>
<p>Since the first necessity of government is money, Henry collected
taxes. The existing Council of Finance emitted more than the normal odor
of corruption; Henry made the fearless Sully superintendent of finance,
and gave him a free hand to clear the air and the road between taxes
paid and those received. Maximilien de Bethune, Baron of Rosny, Duke of
Sully, had been Henry’s faithful friend for a quarter of a century, had
fought at his side for fourteen years; now (1597), still only
thirty-seven, he attacked embezzlers and incompetents with such
uncompromising energy that he became the most valuable and unpopular
member of the royal Council. His portrait, by Dumonstier, hangs in the
Louvre: large head, massive brow, sharp suspicious eyes; here was the
practical genius needed to check the romantic spirit of a king who was
too busy as Casanova to be quite Charlemagne. Sully made himself the
watchdog of the administration. As superintendent of finance, highways,
communications, public buildings, fortifications, and artillery, as
governor of the Bastille and surveyor general of Paris, he was
everywhere, supervised everything, insisted on efficiency, economy, and
integrity. He worked through every waking hour, lived austerely in a
simple room bearing pictures of Luther and Calvin on the walls. He
guarded the interests of his fellow Huguenots. He stabilized the
currency, reorganized and disciplined the bureaucracy, and forced
thieving officials to disgorge. He reclaimed for the state all property
and revenues that</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>had been appropriated by individuals during the wars. He compelled
40,- 000 tax dodgers to pay their taxes. He had found the national
tteasury in debt by 296,000,000 livres; he paid off these obligations,
balanced the budget, and gathered a surplus of 13,000,000 livres. He
protected and encouraged all phases of economic life; built roads and
bridges, planned the great canals that were to join the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, the Seine and the Loire;^* he declared all navigable
rivers to be part of the royal domain, forbade obstructions in them, and
renewed the flow of goods through the land.</p>
<p>With the help of such wisely cho.sen ministers Henry proceeded to re-
create France. He restored to the courts and the parlements their lawful
functions and authority; and if he allowed the bureaucratic officials,
for a price, to transmit their positions to their sons, it was not
merely to raise money, but to ensure stability of administration and to
raise up the middle classes — in particular the legal fraternity, or
noblesse de la robe — as offsets and balances to the hostile
aristocracy. Usually too eager for life and work to read a book, th e
King studied carefully Olivier de Serres’ Les Theatre</p>
<p>troduced new industries like the making of fine pottery and glass,
and the culture of silk; he planted mulberry trees in the gardens of
the</p>
<p>Tuileries and Fontainebleau and required that ten thousand sliould be
planted in every diocese. He helped and enlarged the tapestry works of
the Gobelins. To evade the restrictive policies of the masters in the
guilds, he reorganized French industry on a corporative basis —
employers and em- ployees united in each craft and subject to regulation
by the state. Poverty continued, partly because of war, pestilence, and
taxes, partly because the natural inequality of ability, amid the
general equality of greed, ensures in each generation that the majority
of goods will be absorbed by a minor- ity of men. The King himself lived
economically, extravagant only with his mistresses. To occupy the
unemployed and clear the countryside of idle and voracious veterans, he
financed a large variety of public works: streets were broadened and
paved, canals were dug, trees were planted along the highways; parks and
squares — like the Place Royale (now the Place des Vosges) and the Place
Dauphine — were opened to let Paris</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV )</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>breathe. For the disabled destitute the King founded the Hopital de
la Charite. Not all these reforms matured before his sudden death, but
by the end of his reign the country was enjoying such prosperity as it
had not known since Francis I.</p>
<p>Above all, Henry ended the Religious Wars, and taught Catholics and
Protestants to live in peace. Not in amity, for no thoroughgoing
Catholic would admit the right of a Huguenot to exist, and no fervent
Huguenot could view the Catholic worship as anything but pagan idolatry.
Taking his life in his hands, Henry issued (April 13, 1598) the historic
Edict</p>
<p>of Nantes, authorizing the full exercise of the Protestant faith, and
free- dom of the Protestant press, in all of the eight hundred towns of
France except seventeen, in which (as in Paris) Catholicism was
overwhelmingly predominant. The eligibility of Huguenots to public
offices was confirmed; two were already in the Council of State, and the
Huguenot Turenne was to be a marshal of France. The government was to
pay the salaries of Protestant ministers and of the rectors of
Protestant schools. Protestant children were to be admitted, on an
equality with Catholics, to all schools, colleges, universities, and
hospitals. Towns already controlled by the Huguenots — such as La
Rochelle, Montpellier, and Montauban — were to remain so, and their
garrisons and forts were to be maintained by the state. The religious
liberty so granted was still imperfect; it included only Cath- olics and
Protestants; but it constituted the most advanced religious tolera- tion
in Europe. It took a man of doubtful faith to turn “His Most Christian
Majesty” into a Christian.</p>
<p>Catholics throughout France cried out against the edict as a betrayal
of Henry’s promise to support their creed. Pope Clement VIII condemned
it as “ the most accursed that can be imagined, whereby liberty of
conscience is granted to everybody, which is the worst thing in the
world.”<em>® Catholic writers proclaimed anew that a heretic king might
justly be deposed or slain; and Protestant authors like Hotman, who
under Henry III had de- fended popular sovereignty, now praised the
virtues of absolutism — in a Protestant king.</em>’* The Parlement of
Paris long refused to give the edict that official registration without
which, according to custom, no royal decree could become accepted law.
Henry summoned the members and explained that what he had done was
indispensable to peace and the reconstruction of France. The Parlement
yielded, and it received six Huguenots into its membership.</p>
<p>Perhaps to quiet the Catholic opposition and placate the Pope, Henry
allowed the Jesuits to return to France (1603). Sully argued stoutly
against the move. The Jesuits, he urged, were “men of genius, but full
of cunning and artifice”; they were committed to the cause of the
Hapsburgs, there- fore of France’s enemies, Spain and Austria; they were
pledged and in -</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>dined to unconditionally obey the pope, who was a geographical
prisoner and financial dependent of the Hapsburgs; they would sooner or
later dictate Henry’s policies, or, failing therein, they would persuade
some fanatic to “take away your life by poison or other means.” Henry
replied that the support of the Jesuits would be a great help to him in
unifying France, and their continued exile and hostility would be more
dangerous to his life and policies than their re-entry into France.* He
accepted the Jesuit Pierre Coton as his confessor, found him likable and
faithful, and devoted himself to the administration of France and the
turbulence of love.</p>
<p>V. THE satyr</p>
<p>In the Conde Museum at Chantilly there is a delectable portrait, by
Frans Pourbus the Younger, showing Henry in full maturity of power and
pride: lithe of build, simply dressed in baggy breeches and black
doublet and hose, left arm akimbo, a ruff under his gray beard, a
majestic nose, a firm mouth, eyes alert, skeptical, and humane. His many
years of campaigning had given him the bearing, morals, and odor of a
soldier: strong, active, tireless, too busy to indulge in cleanliness or
to duly change his clothes; sometimes, said a friend, “he stank like a
corpse.”^® After a day of march - ing or fighting he would alarm his
aides by organizing a hunt. He was a paragon of courage, but he had a
tendency to diarrhea when battle neared,*® and in his final seven years
he suffered from dysentery, dysuria, and gout. His mind was as
mettlesome and resilient as his body. He saw through buncombe readily,
seized the essence of matters at once, wrote letters still quick with
life, and brightened France and history with his wit. When he named La
Vieuville to an office and the grateful recipient said. Biblically,
“Lord, I am not worthy,” Henry replied, “I know it quite well, but
my</p>
<p>nephew asked me to appoint you.”<em>’^ Once, on his way to dinner, he
was stopped by a petitioner who began pompously, “Sire, Agesilaus, King
of Lacedaemon —” “Fcrarre saint - gris!” moaned Henry. “I have heard of
him; but he had dined, and I haven’t.”</em>® “He was,” says a French
historian, “the most intelligent of French kings.”*®</p>
<p>He was also the most beloved. Not yet the most popular; half of
France still accepted him grudgingly. But those who knew him closely
were ready to go to the stake for him, some inclusively. He was the most
approachable of rulers, unpretentious, natural, good-natured, not quick
to take offense, never tardy to forgive. His court complained of his
unwillingness to put on the majesty of a king. He allowed poets and
playwrights to make fun of</p>

accuracy of this report of a private conversation.</li>

<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>him, though he liked it better when Alalherbe made him a god of
virtue and charm. He went to see the farces that satirized him, and he
dulled their barbs with his laughter. He took no revenge on those who
had opposed him by deed or speech — “All the for ests in my kingdom
would not provide enough gibbets if all who have written or preached
against me were to be hanged.”<em>® He was as sensitive as a poet, and
felt the poverty of the people almost as keenly as the beauty of women.
He was no stoic; control of his emotions was not among his virtues. He
had many faults. He could be thoughtlessly rude and gaily coarse. He had
a Rabelais in him — he enjoyed risque stories and told them beyond
compare. He gambled too much at cards, lost heavily, cheated often, but
always restored his lawless gains.®</em> He neglected the pursuit of a
retreating enemy to pursue a retreating woman.</p>
<p>We must not list all his loves. Three women in particular marked his
road to the throne. To “La Belle Corisande” he wrote burning billets: “I
devour your hands . . . and kiss your feet a million times … It would be
a desolate spot indeed where we rw’o would be bored together.”®® By 1589
he was bored, and he discovered Esther Ymbert de Boislambert. A year
later, aged thirty-seven, and undeterred by gonorrhea,®® he lost his
heart to Gabrielle d’Estrees, then a girl of seventeen, whom a poet
endued with “golden hair, starry eyes, lily throat, pearly fingers, and
alabaster breasts.”®^ Her lover, Bellegarde, recklessly described her
beauty to the King; Henry galloped twelve miles, in disguise, through
enemy terrain, to see her. She laughed at his long nose; he fell at her
feet; Bellegarde with- drew. She yielded to the charms of francs and
royalty and bore Henry three children. He took her to court and on his
hunts, caressed her in public, thought of marrying her if Margot would
give him a divorce.</p>
<p>Huguenot and Catholic preachers joined in condemning him as an arrant
adulterer, and brave Sully reproached him for wasting state funds on
courtesans. He begged forgiveness on the plea that, having labored so
arduously in war and government, and having fared so ill in marriage, he
was entitled, like a good soldier, to some recreation.®® For eight years
he loved Gabrielle as uxoriously as was possible to a spirit so ondoyant
et divers. But Gabrielle became fat and acquisitive. She intrigued
against Sully, called him “valet”; Henry raged, told her that he valued
such a minister above ten such mistresses. He relented and again talked
of marry- ing her, but on April 10, 1599, she died in giving birth to a
dead child. He mourned her bitterly and wrote, “The plant of love within
me is</p>
<p>dead.”®®</p>
<p>It revived two months later w hen he met Henriette d’Entragues, daugh
- ter of that Marie Toucher who had served Charles IX. Mother, father,
and half-brother forbade her to capitulate except for a wedding ring.
Henry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>wrote her a promise of marriage, conditional on her bearing him a
son; Sully tore it up before his face; Henry wrote another and delivered
it with twenty thousand crowns. The lady’s conscience cleared, and she
became</p>
<p>divorce on the same terms, and offered as a bride Maria de’ Medici,
daughter</p>
<p>cancel the huge debt France owed them if Henry made Maria his
queen.®^ The marriage was celebrated by proxy at Florence (October 5,
1600). Henry tore himself away from a battlefield to go as far as Lyon
to greet his wife; he found her tall and fat and imperious, gave her
every royal courtesy, begot Louis XIII, and returned to Mile.
d’Entragues. Periodically, however, he performed his marital duties.
Marie de Medicis (as France called her) bore him seven children in ten
years. Henry brought them up, together with his offspring by Gabrielle
and Henriette, at St.-Germain-en- Laye.</p>
<p>Henriette was presented to the Queen and was lodged in a palace near
the Louvre; but, having borne a son to the King, she insisted that she,
not Marie, was the rightful queen. Her father and half-brother plotted
to kidnap her and her son to Spain and to have Philip III acknowledge
him as the true dauphin of France (1604). The plot was discovered, the
brother was arrested, the father was released on returning Henry’s
promise of marriage. Henry continued to pursue Henriette like a famished
satyr; she returned his caresses with disgust and hatred, and accepted
bribes from Philip III to serve as a spy for Spain.®*</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ASSASSINATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid these incredible absurdities the King schemed to break the
cordon with which the Hapsburgs had imprisoned France — the iron circle
of the Spanish Netherlands, Luxembourg, Lorraine, Franche-Comte,
Austria, the Valtelline passes. Savoy, Italy, and Spain. Sully, in
writing his memoirs, claimed to have proposed to Henry and to James I of
England a “Grand Design”: France, England, Scotland, Denmark, S weden,
the United Prov- inces (Holland), Protestant Germany, Switzerland, and
Venice were to unite against the Hapsburgs, wrest America from Spain,
free Germany from the Emperor, and drive the Spaniards from the
Netherlands; then the victors were to divide all Europe except Russia,
Turkey, Italy, and Spain into a federated “Christian Republic” of
fifteen autonomous states trading with one another without tariffs, and
submitting their foreign</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>policies to a federal council armed with supreme military force.®*
Henry himself seems never to have entertained this grandiose conception;
prob- ably the limit of his hope was to extend France to “natural
boundaries” at the Rhine, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the sea, and to
liberate her from fear of Spain and Austria. For these ends he resorted
to any available means: he sought alliances with the Protestant powers,
he helped the Dutch in their revolt against Spain, he planned to support
an uprising of Moriscos in Valencia, he encouraged the Turks to attack
Austria.^*</p>
<p>A trivial dispute offered to spark this Bourbon-Hapsburg enmity into
a European war. On March 25, 1609, there died, without issue, Duke John
William of the little triune principality of Jiilich-Cleves-Berg,
near</p>
<p>Cologne. The Emperor Rudolf, as its suzerain, claimed the right to
name a Catholic to this petty throne. Henry protested that the further
subjec- tion of the duchy to the Hapsburgs would endanger the eastern
boundary of France. He joined Brandenburg, the Palatinate, and the
United Provinces in determination to appoint a Protestant successor to
John William; and when Archduke Leopold of Austria occupied Jiilich with
Imperial troops Henry prepared for war.</p>
<p>His final romance harmonized fetchingly with this call to Armageddon.
Though he was now fifty-six and looked older, he developed in 1609 an
uncontrollable longing for Charlotte de Montmorency, then sixteen. She
rejected his advances, but consented, at his behest, to marry the new
Prince of Conde. “Are you not very wicked,” his mistress Henriette is
said to have taunted him, “to want to bed with the wife of your son? For
you well know that you have told me that he 〔the Prince〕 was your
off-</p>
<p>spring.”^^ Conde fled with his bride to Brussels; Henry itched to
pursue her, and Malherbe stitched the royal itches into rhyme. Villeroi,
Henry’s foreign minister, begged Archduke Albert of the Netherlands to
ex-</p>
<p>tradite the Princess to Paris; the Archduke, encouraged by Philip III
of Spain, refused; Villeroi threatened a war “that may set fire to the
four corners of Christendom.”^® It seemed providential to Henry that
Brussels was on the way to Jiilich: he would conquer the lady — and the
Spanish Netherlands — as a prelude to shattering the Empire and humbling
Spain. He hired Swiss mercenaries and prepared to raise an army of
thirty thou- sand men. Janies I of England promised four thousand
more.</p>
<p>Catholic France was alarmed. It gave too much credit to the gossip
that the charms of the Princess were the real casus belly; it noted with
dismay that the King’s allies and generals were mostly Protestants; it
wondered what the fate of Catholicism and the papacy would be in a
Europe where the Catholic south had been conquered by the Protestant
north and a so- recently-Huguenot King. The taxes levied to finance the
dreaded war lowered Henry’s always precarious popularity; even the court
turned</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, xrv</p>
<p>away from him as a man too foolish to realize that he could no longer
be Lothario and Alexander in one. Prophecies were bandied about —
perhaps as hopeful provocations to the suggestible — that he would soon
be killed.</p>
<p>Fran9ois Ravaillac of Angouleme heard the prophecies. Arrested for a
crime that he had not committed, he brooded in his prison, had visions,
studied theology, read tracts defending tyrannicide. Strong of arm, weak
of mind, he dallied with the idea that God had chosen him to fulfill the
prophecies, to save France from Protestant doom. Released, he went to
Paris (1609), lodged with Mme. d’Escoman, a friend of Henriette</p>
<p>d’Entragues, and confessed to her that he had thoughts of killing the
King. A warning was sent to Henry, but he was so accustomed to such
alarms that he took no notice of it. As Henry passed through the streets
Ravaillac tried to approach him; soldiers stopped him; he said he wished
to ask the King if it was true that he was planning war against the
Pope,’ and that the Huguenots were preparing to massacre the Catholics.
He tried to enter a monastery and to join the Jesuits; he was rejected.
He went back to Angouleme to perform his Easter duty; he received the
Sacrament and, from a monk, a little bag containing, he was told, a
fragment of the cross on which Christ had died. He bought a knife and
returned to Paris. Mme. d’Escoman sent a warning to Sully, who
transmitted it to the King.</p>
<p>Henry was preparing to join his army at Chalons. On May 13, 1610,</p>
<p>he appointed the Queen as regent during his absence. On the
fourteenth the Duke of Vendome, his natural son, begged him to stay at
home, for predictions of his assassination had named this as the fatal
day. In the afternoon he decided to take a carriage ride, visit the sick
Sully, and get “a breath of air.” To avoid being noticed he dismissed
his guards, but he was accompanied by seven members of the court.
Ravaillac, who had been watching the Louvre, followed the carriage. At a
point in the Rue de la Ferronnerie it was stopped by a traffic tangle.
Ravaillac leaped upon the step and struck the King so powerfully that
the blade pierced the heart. Henry died almost instantly.</p>
<p>Ravaillac, put to the torture, took full responsibility for his
action, denied that he had any abettors or accomplices, mourned the
violence of his act, but professed confidence that God would forgive it
as in a sacred cause. His limbs were tom from his body by four horses,
his trunk was burned in a public square. Many accused the Jesuits of
having inflamed the as- sassin’s mind; it was pointed out that Mariana’s
De rege, justifying tyran - nicide, had been openly sold in Paris shops.
The Jesuits replied that this book had been explicitly condemned by an
assembly of Jesuits held in Paris in 1606. The Sorbonne judged the
Jesuits guilty of dangerous doc- trines and officially burned Mariana’s
book.^® Marie de Medicis, as regent, protected the Jesuits from harm,
and accepted their guidance in faith and policy.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>HENRY IV</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>France was confused and divided by Henry’s final enterprise and
sudden death. A minority accepted the assassination as an act of God in
defense of the Church. But the great majority, Catholic as well as
Protestant, mourned the passing of a king whose labors for his people
far outweighed his errors, follies, and sins. Frenchmen had not
forgotten the poverty and desolation, the religious turmoil, the
official corruption and incompetence that he had inherited with the
throne; and they saw now a nation cleansed and orderly, prosperous
despite high taxation, and powerful enough to challenge the long
ascendancy of Spain. They remembered fondly Henry’s simplicity of dress
and conduct and speech, his good humor and kindly nature, his gay
courage in war, his tact in friendship and diplomacy; and their own
moral laxity condoned those amorous escapades in which he had but shown
himself a man after their own desires. He had with warrant called
himself “a loyal king, faithful and true”;“^^ he was also the most human
and humane of French kings; and he was the savior of France. His plan to
extend France to natural boundaries may have seemed impracti- cable, but
Richelieu, twenty years later, followed it, and Louis XIV carried it
through. Soon after his death Europe agreed in calling him Henry the
Great. In the French Revolution all the French kings who succeeded him
were condemned, but Henry IV remained supreme in the affections of the
people.</p>
