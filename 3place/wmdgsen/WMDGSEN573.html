<h4 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>On the Slopes of Parnassus</p>
<p>1558-1603</p>
<p>I. BOOKS</p>
<p>T hey were a swelling legion. “One of the great diseases of this
age,” wrote Bar naby Rich in i doo, “is the multitude of books that doth
so</p>
<p>overcharge the world that it is not able to digest the abundance of
idle matter that is every day hatched and brought into the world.”
“Already,” wrote Robert Burton (1628), “we shall have a va st chaos and
confusion of books; we are oppressed with them, our eyes ache with
reading, our fingers with turning.”^ Both these plaintiffs wrote
books.</p>
<p>The aristocracy, having learned to read, rewarded with material
patron- age authors who had softened them with dedications. Cecil,
Leicester, Sidney, Raleigh, Essex, Southampton, the earls and the
Countess of Pem- broke were good patrons, who established between
English nobles and authors a relation that continued even after Johnson
lectured Chesterfield. Publishers paid authors some forty shillings for
a pamphlet, some five pounds for a book.^ A few authors managed to live
by their pens; the desperate profession of “man of letters” now took
form in England. Private</p>
<p>The publishers themselves led a harried existence, subject to state
law and public whim. There were 250 of them in Elizabeth’s England, for
publishing and bookselling were still one trade. Most of them did their
own printing; the separation of printer and publisher began toward the
end of this reign. Publishers, printers, and booksellers united (1557)
in a Stationers’ Company; registry of a publication with this guild
constituted copyright, which, however, protected not the author but only
the pub- lisher. Normally the company would register only such
publications as had obtained a legal license to be printed. It was a
felony to write, print, sell, or possess any material injurious to the
reputation of the Queen or the government, to publish or import
heretical books or papal bulls or briefs, or to possess a book that
upheld the supremacy of the popes over the</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>English Church.® There were several executions for violation of these
de- crees. The Stationers’ Company was empowered to search all printing
establishments, to burn all unlicensed publications, and to imprison
their publishers.^ Elizabethan censorship was more severe than any
before the Reformation, but literature flourished; as in
eighteenth-century France, wits were sharpened by the peril of
print.</p>
<p>Scholars were few; it was an age of creation rather than criticism,
and the humanistic current had run dry in those hot theological years.
Most historians were still chroniclers, dividing their narratives by
years; Richard Knolles, however, surprised Burghley with the comparative
excellence of his General History of the Turks (1603). Raphael Holinshe
d’s Chronicles (1577) gave him an unearned increment of fame by
supplying Shakespeare with stories of the English kings. John Stow’s
Chronicles of England (1580) was dressed up with “some colors of wisdom,
invitements to virtue, and loathing of naughty facts,”® but its
scholarship was lamentable, and its prose had a powerful virtus
dormitiva. His Survey of London (1598) was more scholarly, but brought
him no more bread; in old age he had to be given a license to beg.®
William Camden, in good Latin, recorded the geography, scenery, and
antiquities of England in Britannia (1582); and his Rerum Anglicarum et
hiber- nicarum annales regnante Elizabetha (1615-27) based its story on
conscientious study of original documents. Camden glorified the great
Queen indiscriminately, lauded Spenser, ignored Shakespeare, and praised
Roger Ascham, but mourned that so fine a scholar had died poor through
love of dicing-and cockfighting.’^</p>
<p>Ascham, secretary to “Bloody Mary” and tutor to Elizabeth, left at hi
s death (1568) the most famous of English treatises on education. The
Schole- master (1570), primarily on the teaching of Latin, but
containing, in strong, simple English, a plea for the replacement of
Etonian severity with Christian kindness in educat ion. He told how, at
a dinner with men high in Elizabeth’s government, the conversation had
turned on education through flogging; how Cecil had favored gentler
methods; and how Sir Richard Sackville had pri- vately confessed to
Ascham that “a fond 〔fool ish〕 schoolmaster . . . drave me, with fear
of beating, from all love of learning.”®</p>
<p>The major and most fruitful function of the scholars was to
impregnate the English mind with foreign thought. In the second half of
the sixteenth century a wave of translations swept over the land from
Greece, Rome, Italy, and France. Homer had to wait till 1611 for George
Chapman, and the lack of English versions of Greek plays probably shared
in giving the Elizabethan drama a “romantic” rather than a “classical” f
orm. But there were translations of Theocritus’ idyls, Musaeus’ Hero and
Leander^ Epictetus’ Enchiridion, Aris - totle’s Ethics and Politics,
Xenophon’s Cyropaedia and Oeconowicus, the</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>the plays of Plautus, Terence, and Seneca, the histories of Livy,
Sallust, Tacitus, and Suetonius. From Italy came Petrarch’s sonnets,
Boccaccio’s Filocopo and Fiammetta (but no Decameron till 1620), the
histories of Guicciardini and Machiavelli, the Orlandos of Boiardo and
Ariosto, Castiglione’s Libro del cortegianOy the Gerusalevmie liber at a
and Awinta of Tasso, Guarini’s Pastor fidOy and many fabulous fiovelle
by Bandello and others, gathered into such collections as William
Painter’s Palace of Pleasure (1566). Machiavelli’s II Principe was not
done into English till 1640, but its substance was familiar to the
Elizabethans; Gabriel Harv ey reported that at Cambridge “Duns Scotus
and Thomas Aquinas, with the whole rabblement of Schoolmen . . . were
ex- pelled the University,” and were replaced with Machiavelli and Jean
Bodin.^ From Spain came one of the longest ro’mances, Amadis de Gaida;
one of the first picaresque novels, Lazarillo de Tormes; one of the
classic pastorals, the Diana of Montemayor. The best spoils from France
were the poems of the Pleiade, and the essays of Montaigne, nobly
Englished by John Florio (1603).</p>
<p>The influence of these translations upon Elizabethan literature was
im- mense. Classical allusions began — and for two centuries continued —
to encumber English poetry and prose. French was known to most memor-
able Elizabethan authors, so that translations were not indispensable.
Italy fascinated England; English pastorals looked back to Sannazaro,
Tasso, and Guarini, English sonnets to Petrarch, English fiction to
Boccaccio and the novelle; these last gave plots to Marlowe,
Shakespeare, Webster, Massinger, and Ford, and Italian locales to many
Elizabethan plays. Italy, which had rejected the Reformation, had gone
beyond it to break down the old theology, even the Christian ethic.
While Elizabethan religion debated Catholicism and Protestantism,
Elizabethan literature, ignoring that con- flict, returned to the spirit
and verve of the Renaissance. Italy, struck down for a time by a change
in trade routes, handed the torch of the Rebirth to Spain, France, and
England.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>THE WAR OF THE WITS</li>
</ol>
<p>In this Elizabethan exuberance both poetry and prose poured down in a
turbulent flood. We know the names of two hundred Elizabethan poets. But
until Spenser introduced his Faerie Queene (1590), it was prose that
caught the ear of Elizabethan England.</p>
<p>John Lyly did it first with his fanciful Euphues, or the Anatomy of
Wit — i.e., of intelligence — in 1579. Lyly proposed to show how a fine
mind and character can be formed through education, experience, travel,
and wise counsel. Euphues (Good Speech) is a young Athenian whose ad-
ventures provide the scaffolding for wordy discourses on education,
man-</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>nets,- friendship, love, atheism. What made the book the best seller
of its time was its style — a flux of antitheses, alliterations,
similes, puns, balanced clauses, classical allusions, and conceits that
took the court of Elizabeth* by storm and held the fashion for a
generation. For example:</p>
<p>This young gallant, of more wit than wealth, and yet of more</p>
<p>wealth than wisdom, seeing himself inferior to none in pleasant con-
ceits, thought himself superior to all in honest conditions, insomuch
that he deemed himself so apt to all things that he gave himself almost
to nothing.^®</p>
<p>Whether Lyly caught this disease from the Italian Marini or the
Spaniard Guevara or the rhetoriker of Flanders is in dispute. In any
case Lyly</p>
<p>welcomed the virus and transmitted it to a host of Elizabethans; it
spoiled Shakespeare’s early comedies, tinged Bacon’s Essays, and gave a
word to the language.</p>
<p>It was a word-conscious age. Gabriel Harvey, a Cambridge tutor, ex-
erted all his influence to turn English poetry from accent and rhyme to
classic meters based on syllabic quantities. At his urging, Sidney and
Spenser formed in London a literary club, the Areopagus, which strove
for a time to force Elizabethan vitality into Virgilian forms.
Thomas</p>
<p>Nash parodied Harvey’s “hopping” hexameters and laughed them
literally out of court. When Harvey added insult to pedantry by
condemning the morals of Nash’s friend Greene, he became the prime
target in a pamphlet war that brought into England all the resources of
Renaissance vituper- ation.</p>
<p>Robert Greene’s life summarized a thousand literary Bohemian
careers</p>
<p>Harvey, Nash, and Marlowe; there he spent his time among “wags as
lewd as” himself, with whom he “consumed the flower of his youth.”</p>
<p>I was drowned in pride; whoredom was my daily exercise, and</p>
<p>gluttony with drunkenness was my only delight. … I was so far from
calling upon God that I seldom thought on God, but took much de-</p>
<p>light in swearing and blaspheming the name of God. … If I may have my
desire while I live, I am satisfied; let me shift after death as I
may.</p>
<p>… I feared the judges of the bench no more than I dread the</p>
<p>judgments of God.^*</p>
<p>He traveled in Italy and Spain, and there, he tells us, he “saw
and</p>
<p>practiced such villainy as is abominable to declare.” Returning, he
became a familiar figure in London taverns, with his red hair, pointed
beard, silk stockings, and personal bodyguard. He married and wrote
tenderly of</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS 69</p>
<p>marital fidelity and bliss; then he forsook his wife for a mistress,
upon whom he spent his wife’s fortune. From his firsthand knowledge he
de - scribed the arts of the underworld in A Notable Discovery
〔uncovering〕 of Cozenage (1591) and warned rural visitors to London
against the wiles of swindlers, cardsharpers, pickpockets, panders, and
prostitutes; where- upon the underworld tried to kill him. It surprises
us that in a life so assiduously devoted to vice he found time to write,
with journalistic haste and verve, a dozen novels (in Euphuestic style),
thirty-five pamphlets, and many successful plays. As his vigor and
income declined, he saw some sense in virtue, and repented as eloquently
as he had sinned. In 1591 he pub- lished a Farewell to Folly. In 1592 he
composed two tracts of some moment. One, A Quip for an Upstart Courtier,
attacked Gabriel Harvey. In the other, Greene’s Groatsworth of Wit
Bought with a Million of Repentance, he attacked Shakespeare and called
upon his fellow lechers — apparently Marlowe, Peele, and Nash — to quit
their sinning and join him in piety and remorse. On September 2, 1592,
he sent to his forsaken wife an appeal to reimburse with ten pounds a
shoemaker without whose charity “I had perished in the streets.”^* The
next day, in the house of this shoemaker, he died — according to Harvey,
from “a surfeit of pickled herring and Rhenish wine.” His landlady,
forgiving his debts for his verse, crowned his head with a laurel wreath
and paid for his funeral.^®</p>
<p>Of all the Elizabethan pamphleteers, Greene’s friend Tom Nash had</p>
<p>the sharpest tongue and the widest audience. Son of a curate and
tired of decency, Nash graduated from Cambridge into London’s Bohemia,
but - tered his bread with his pen, and learned to write “as fast as
〔his〕 hand could trot.” He established the picaresque novel in England
with The Unfortunate Traveller, or The Life of Jack Wilton (1594). When
Greene died, and Harvey assailed both Greene and Nash in Four Letters,
Nash retaliated with a series of pamphlets culminating in Have with You
to Saffron Walden — ^Harvey’s birthplace — ^in 1596.</p>
<p>Readers, be merry, for in me there shall want nothing I can do</p>
<p>to make you merry … It shall cost me a fall, but I will get him</p>
<p>hooted out of the University . . . ere I give him over. What will
you</p>
<p>give me when I bring him upon the stage in one of the
principalest</p>
<p>colleges in Cambridge?^’*</p>
<p>Harvey survived this experience, outlived the Bohemians, and died at
eighty- five in 1630. Nash completed his friend Marlowe’s play Dido, col
- laborated with Ben Jonson in The Isle of Dogs (1597), was indicted for
sedition, and subsided into a cautious obscurity. At the age of
thirty-four (1601) he crowned a fast life with an early death.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>in. PHILIP SIDNEY: 1554-85</p>
<p>Far from this maddened crowd, Sidney rode serenely to an even</p>
<p>earlier end. Facing us still in the National Portrait Gallery of
London, he seems too delicate for a man: slender of face, with auburn
hair, and “not a morsel too much of health,” said Languet;<em>®
“extremely beautiful,” said Aubrey,^® “not masculine enough, yet … of
great courage.” Some grum - blers thought him a bit pompous</em>^ and
felt that he carried perfection to excess; only his heroic end won him
pardon for his virtues.</p>
<p>But who would not be proud to have had for his mother Lady Mary</p>
<p>Dudley, daughter of that Duke of Northumberland who had ruled England
under Edward VI; and to have had for his father Sir Henry Sidney, Lord
President of Wales and thrice Lord Deputy of Ireland; and to have re-
ceived his Christian name from King Philip II of Spain as his godfather?
Part of his fleeting life was lived in spacious Penshurst Place, whose
oak- beam ceilings, picture walls, and crystal chandelier are among the
fairest relics of that time. At the age of nine he was appointed lay
rector to a church benefice, which brought him sixty pounds a year. At
ten he entered Shrewsbury School, which was not too far from Ludlow
Castle, his father’s residence as Lord President of Wales. To the boy of
eleven Sir Henry wrote loving words of wisdom.’®</p>
<p>Philip learned these lessons well and became a favorite with his
uncle Leicester and his father’s friend William Cecil. After three years
at</p>
<p>Oxford he was sent to Paris as a minor member of an English mission.
He was received at the court of Charles IX and witnessed the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew. He traveled leisurely in France, the Netherlands,
Germany, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Italy. At Frankfurt he
began a lifelong friendship with Hubert Languet, one of the intellectual
leaders of the Huguenots; at Venice he had his portrait painted by Paolo
Veronese; at Padua he imbibed the traditions of the Petrarchan sonnet.
Back in Eng- land, he was welcomed at court and for almost two years
danced attendance on the Queen, but he forfeited her favor for a time by
opposing her pros- pective marriage with the Duke of Alen9on. He had all
the knightly</p>
<p>qualities — pride of bearing, skill and bravery in tournament,
courtesy in court, honor in all dealings, and eloquence in love. He
studied Castigli one’s Courtier and tried to model his conduct on that
gentle philosopher’s ideal of a gentleman, and others modeled themselves
on Sidney. Spenser called him “the President of Noblesse and of
Chivalry.”</p>
<p>It was a mark of the times that the aristocracy, which had once
scorned literacy, now wrote poetry and suffered poets to come to them.
Sidney, though not rich, became the most active literary patron of his
generation.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>He helped Camden, Hakluyt, Nash, Harvey, Donne, Daniel, Jonson, and,
above all, Spenser, who thanked him as “the hope of all learned men and
the patron of my young muse.”^^ It was quite out of order that Stephen
Gosson should dedicate to Sidney his Schoole of Abuse (1579), whose
title page described it as “a pleasant invective against poets, pipers,
players, jesters, and such like caterpillars of the commonwealth.”
Sidney took up the gauntlet and wrote the first of the Elizabethan
classics — The Defence of Poesy.</p>
<p>Taking a lead from Aristotle and Italian critics, he defined poetry
as</p>
<p>“an art of imitation . . . representing, counterfeiting, or figuring
forth . . .</p>
<p>The philosopher . . . and the historian . . . would win the goal,
the</p>
<p>one by precept, the other by example; but both, not having both, do
both halt. For the philosopher, setting down with thorny arguments the
bare rule 〔of morals〕, is so hard of utterance, and so misty to be
conceived, that one that hath no other guide but him shall wade in</p>
<p>him till he be old, before he shall find sufficient cause to be
honest.</p>
<p>For his knowledge standeth so upon the abstract and the general that
happy is that man that may understand him . . . On the other side</p>
<p>the historian, wanting the precept, is tied, not to what should be
but to what is . . . that his example draweth no necessary consequence,
and therefore a less fruitful doctrine.</p>
<p>Now doth the peerless poet perform both, for whatsoever the philos-
opher said should be done, he gives a perfect picture of it by some one
by whom he supposeth it was done, so as he completed! the general notion
with the particular example. A perfect picture, I say, for he</p>
<p>yieldeth to the powers of the mind an image of that whereof the</p>
<p>philosopher bestoweth but a wordish description, which doth neither
strike, pierce, nor possess the sight of the soul so much as that other
doth.21</p>
<p>Poetry, therefore, in Sidney’s view, includes all imaginative
literature — drama, verse, and imaginative prose. “It is not rhyming and
versifying that maketh poetry. One may be a poet without versifying, a
versifier without poetry.”</p>
<p>He added example to precept. In the same year 1580 that produced the
Defence^ he began to write The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia. This
Countess, his sister, was one of the best-flattered ladies of the
century. Bom in 1561 and therefore seven years younger than Philip, she
received all the education she could stand, including Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew, but her charm survived. She became a member of Elizabeth’s
household</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, in</p>
<p>and accompanied the Queen on the royal progresses. Her uncle
Leicester advanced part of the dowry that enabled her to marry Henry,
Earl of Pembroke. “She was very salacious,” according to Aubrey, and
took some lovers to supplement her husband; but this did not deter
Philip from ador- ing her and writing the Arcadia at her request.</p>
<p>Following the example of Sannazaro’s Arcadia (1504), Sidney imagined,
at length and ease, a world of brave princes, exquisite princesses,
knightly combats, mystifying disg uises, and fascinating scenery. “The
loveliness of Urania is the greatest thing the world can show, but the
least that may be praised in her”;“ and Palladius had “a piercing wit
quite devoid of ostenta - tion, high erected thoughts seated in a heart
of courtesy, an eloquence as sweet in the uttering as slow to be
uttering, a behavior so noble as gave majesty to adversity”;*® clearly
Sidney had read Euphues. The story is an amorous maze: Pyrocles
disguises himself as a woman to be near the fair Philoclea; she
frustrates him by loving him as a sister; her father falls in love, with
him, thinking him a woman; her mother falls in love with him, per-
ceiving him to be a man; however, everything ends according to the Ten
Commandments. Sidney did not take the tale very seriously; he never
corrected the sheets he had dashed off for his sister; on his deathbed
he ordered them burned. They were preserved, edited, and published
(1590), and were for a decade the most admired work in Elizabethan
prose.</p>
<p>While writing this romance and the Defence, and amid his life as
diplo- mat and soldier, Sidney composed a sonnet sequence that paved the
way for Shakespeare’s. For this he needed some unsuccessful love. He
found it in Penelope Devereux, daughter of the first Earl of Essex; she
welcomed his sighs and rhymes as lawful game, but married Baron Rich
(1581); Sidney continued to address sonnets to her, even after his own
marriage to Frances Walsingham. Few Elizabethans were shocked by this
poetic license; no one expected a man to write sonnets to his own wife,
whose generosity stilled the muse. The sequence was published (1591)
after Sidney’s death under the title of Astrophel and Stella — star
lover and star. It followed the style of Petrarch, whose Laura had
strangely anticipated the eyes, hair, brow, cheeks, skin, and lips of
Penelope. Sidney was quite aware that his passion was a poetic
mechanism; he himself had written: “If I were a mistress, 〔sonneteers〕
would never persuade me they were in lo ve.”*^ Once accepted as fair
play, these sonnets are England’s best before Shakespeare’s. Even the
moon is sick with love:</p>

<p>In 1585 Sidney was sent by Elizabeth to aid the Netherland rebels</p>
<p>against Spain. Though not yet thirty-one, he was made governor of
Flush- ing. He displeased the pinching Queen by asking for more supplies
and better wages for his soldiers, who were being paid in debased
currency.^* He led his men to the capture of Axel (July 6, 1586) and
fought in the front of the action. But in the battle of Zutphen
(September 22) he was too brave. His horse having been killed in a
charge, Sidney leaped upon another and fought his way into the enemy’s
ranks. A musket ball entered his thigh. His horse, out of control, fled
back to L eicester’s camp.* Thence Sidney was taken to a private home in
Arnhem. For twenty-five days he suffered under incompetent surgeons.
Gangrene set in, and on October 17 the “wonder of our age” (so Spenser
mourned him) welcomed death. “I would not change my joy,” he said on
that last day, “for the empire of the world.”^® When his corpse was
brought to London it received such a funeral as England would not see
again before Nelson’s death.</p>

<p>“Sidney is dead,” wrote Spenser, “dead is my friend, dead is the
world’s delight.” -* It was Sidney who had given Spenser the courage to
be a poet. Edmund had begun unpropitiously as the son of a journeyman
clothmaker, too distantly related to the aristocratic Spensers to allow
the boy to be noticed. Charitable funds sent him to the Merchant
Taylors’ School, then to Pembroke Hall in Cambridge, where he worked for
his board. By</p>
<p>seventeen he was writing — even publishing — poetry. Harvey tried to
guide him into classic molds and themes; Spenser tried humbly to please
him, but soon rebelled against the bonds that uncongenial meters placed
upon his muse. In 1579 he showed Harvey the first portion of The Faerie
Queene-,</p>

<p>Harvey had no fancy for its medieval allegorical content, no
appreciation for its fine metrical form. He advised the poet to abandon
the project. Spenser continued it.</p>
<p>It was the gruff and bellicose Harvey who secured for Spenser a place
in the service of the Earl of Leicester. There the poet met Sidney,
loved him, dedicated to him The Shepherd’s Calendar (1579). The form
echoed Theocritus, but followed the plan of popular almanacs, allotting
the tasks of shepherds according to the season of the year. The theme
was the un- requited love of the shepherd Colin Clout for the cruel
Rosalind. It is not recommended reading, hut Sidney’s praise won Spenser
some acclaim. To butter his bread, the poet accepted the post of
secretary to Arthur, Lord Grey, the new Lord Deputy of Ireland (1579);
accompanied him to war, and saw and approved Grey’s slaughter of the
surrendering Irish and Spaniards at Smerwick. After seven years of
clerical service to the English government in Ireland he was granted,
from the confiscated property of Irish rebels, the Castle of Kilcolman,
on the road between Mallow and Limerick, and three thousand acres.</p>
<p>There Spenser settled down to gentleman farming and genteel poetry.
He commemorated Sidney’s death in an elo quent but lengthy elegy,
Astrophel (1586). Then be polished and elongated The Faerie Queene. Warm
with enthusiasm, he crossed to England in 1589, was presented by Raleigh
to the Queen, and dedicated the first three “books” to her “to live with
the eter nity of her fame.” To ensure a wide reception he prefaced the
poem with laudatory verses addressed to the Countess of Pembroke, Lady
Carew, Sir Christopher Hatton, Raleigh, Burghley, Walsingham, Lords
Hunsdon, Buckhurst, Grey, and Howard of Effingham, and the earls of
Essex, Northumberland, Oxford, Ormonde, and Cumberland. Burghley,
feuding with Leicester, called Spenser an idle rhymer, but many hailed
him as the greatest poet since Chaucer. The Queen relaxed enough to
award him a pension of fifty pounds a year, which Burghley, as Lord
Treasurer, delayed in paying. Spenser had hoped for something more
substantial. Disappointed, he returned to his Irish castle and continued
his idealistic epic amid barbarism, hatred, and fear.</p>
<p>He had planned the poem to be in twelve books; he published three in
1590 and three more in 1596, and proceeded no further; even so The
Faerie Queene is twice the length of The Iliad, thrice that of Paradise
Lost. Each book was offered as an allegory — of holiness, temperance,
chastity, friendship, justice, courtesy; the whole was intended “to
fashion a gentle - man or noble person in virtuous and gentle
discipline””® by giving him formative instances; all this accorded with
Sidney’s conception of poet ry as morality conveyed by imagined
examples. So dedicated to decency, Spenser could allow himself only a
few voluptuous passages; he glances</p>

<p>once at a ^^snowy breast bare to ready spoil, but goes ne plus ultra.
Through six cantos he sings the high note of chivalric love as unselfish
service to fair women.</p>
<p>To us, who have forgotten chivalry and are bored by knights and con-
fused by allegories. The Faerie Queene is at first quaintly delightful,
at length unbearable. Its political allusions, which contemporaries
enjoyed or resented, are lost upon us; the theological battles that it
adumbrates are the subsiding tremors of our infancy; its narratives are
at best melodious echoes of Virgil, Ariosto, and Tasso. No poem in the
world’s literature surpasses The Faerie Queene in artificial conceits,
awkward inversions, pre- tentious archaisms and neologisms, and romantic
grandiosities unleavened with Ariosto’s smile. And yet Keats and Shelley
loved Spenser and made him ‘^the Poets’ poet.” Why.^ Was it because,
here and there, some sensu - ous beauty of form redeemed a medieval
absurdity, some splendor of description adorned an unreality? The new
nine-line Spenserian stanza was a difficult medium, and Spenser often
startles us with its rounded perfection and flowing ease; but how many
times he spoils its reason for a rhyme!</p>
<p>He interrupted the Queene to write some briefer poems that perhaps
justify his fame. His Amoretti, ’’little loves” in sonnet form ( 1594 ),
may</p>
<p>Tell me, ye merchants’ daughters, did ye see</p>

<p>Was ever maid brought to fulfillment more melodiously?</p>
<p>Spenser sustained this flight in Four Hyvms (1596) honoring
earthly</p>
<p>love, earthly beauty, heavenly love, and heavenly beauty. Following
Plato, Ficino, and Castiglione, and leading to Keats’s Endymion, he
cried peccavi over his “many lewd layes,” and bade his soul pierce
through physical loveliness to find and feel the divine beauty that
hides in divers degrees in all earthly things.</p>
<p>L iving on a volcano of Irish misery, Spenser’s life was every day
near death. Just before the volcano of resentment erupted again, he
wrote in fine prose (for only a poet can write good prose) his Vieiv of
the Present State of Ireland, advocating a better deployment of English
funds and forces for the thorough subjugation of the island. In October
1598 the dispossessed Irish of Munster rose in wild revolt, drove out
English settlers, and burned down the Castle of Kilcolman. Spenser and
his wife barely escaped with their lives and fled to England. Three
months later, all funds and passion spent, the poet died (1599). The
young Earl of Essex, destined soon to follow him, paid for the funeral;
nobles and poets walked in the procession, and threw flowers and elegies
into the Westminster Abbey grave.</p>
<p>A craze for sonnets now ran through England, rivaling the drama’s
fury — nearly all excellent in form, stereotyped in theme and phrase,
nearly all addressed to virgins or patrons and bemoaning their
strait-laced or tight- fisted frugality. Beauty is urged to let itself
be reaped before it rots on the stalk; sometimes an original note
intrudes, and the lover promises the lady a child as reward for
expeditious conjugation. Every poet seeks and</p>
<p>finds a Laura — Daniel’s Delia, Lodge’s Phillis, Constable’s Diana,
Fulke Greville’s Caelia. Most famous of these sonneteers was Samuel
Daniel; however, Ben Jonson, who was more tough than “rare,” called him
“an honest man, but no poet.”®^ Michael Drayton’s Pegasus roamed through
all forms of poetry with his feet of prose, but one of his sonnets
struck a fresh note, stinging the lass out of her stinginess by bidding
her farewell — “Since there’s no help, come, let us kiss and part!”</p>

<p>ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>All in all, outside the drama, Elizabethan literature was still a
generation behind the French. The prose was vigorous, flexible, often
involved, verbose, and fanciful, but sometimes moving with a royal
dignity or a stately rhythm; it produced no Rabelais or Montaigne. The
poetry echoed foreign models timidly, except for the Epithalainium and
The Faerie</p>
<p>Queene. Spenser never found an audience on the Continent, but neither
did Ronsard in England; poetry makes of language and feeling a music
that cannot be heard across the frontiers of speech. Ballads noticed and
reached the people more intimately than the poetry of the palace and the
court; they were posted on house and tavern walls, and were sung and
sold in the streets; “Lord Randall” still moves us with its dirge.*®
Perhaps it was this popular poetry, and not the pretty artifices of the
sonneteers, that prepared the Elizabethans to appreciate
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>V. THE STAGE</p>
<p>How, then, did English literature, so negligible in the long drought
be- tween Chaucer and Spenser, rise to Shakespeare? Because of wealth
grow- ing and spreading; because of a long and fruitful peace, a
stimulating and triumphant war; because of foreign literature and travel
broadening the English mind. Plautus and Terence were teaching England
the art of comedy, Seneca the technique of tragedy; Italian actors
played in Eng- land (i577f.); a thousand experiments were made; between
1592 and 1642 England saw 435 comedies performed. Farces and interludes
developed into comedies; mysteries and moralities gave way to secular
tragic dramas as the once sacred myths lost their hold on belief. In
1553 Nicholas Udall produced in Ralph Roister Doister the first English
comedy in classic form. In 1561 the lawyers of the Inner Temple staged
there Gorboduc, the first English tragedy in classic form.</p>
<p>For a time that form, descended from Rome, seemed destined to mold
the Elizabethan drama. University scholars like Flarvey, lawyer-poets
like George Gascoyne, men of classical learning like Sidney, pleaded for
tlie observance of the three “unities” in a play: that there should be
only one action or plot, and that this should occur in one place, and
represent no longer time than a day. These unities, so far as we know,
were first formu- lated by Lodovico Castelvetro (1570) in a commentary
on Aristotle’s</p>
<p>Poetics. Aristotle himself requires only unity of action; he
recommends that the action should fall “within a single revolution of
the sun”; and he adds what might be called unity of mood — that comedy,
as “a representa - tion of inferior people,” should not be mingled with
tragedy, as “a repre - sentation of heroic action.”®^ Sidney’s Defence
of Poesy took the doctrine</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>of the dramatic unities from Castelvetro and applied it with rigor
and yet good humor to Elizabethan plays, in whose highhanded
geography</p>
<p>you shall have Asia of the one side, and Africa of the other, and
so</p>
<p>many other under kingdoms, that the player, when he comes in,</p>
<p>must ever begin with telling where he is. . . . Now of time they
are</p>
<p>much more liberal; for ordinary it is, that two young princes fall
in</p>
<p>love; after many traverses she is got with child; delivered of a
fair</p>
<p>boy; he . . . groweth a man, falleth in love, and is ready to get
an-</p>
<p>other child; and all this in two hours’ space.^®</p>
<p>France followed the classic rules and produced Racine; England
rejected them, gave its tragic drama romantic freedom and naturalistic
scope, and produced Shakespeare. The ideal of the French Renaissance was
order, reason, proportion, propriety; the ideal of Renaissance England
was liberty, will, humor, life. The Elizabethan audience, composed of
lordlings, mid- dlings, and groundlings, had to have a rich and varied
diet; it demanded action, not lengthy reports of hidden actions; it had
a belly for laughter and did not mind gravediggers bandying philosophies
with a prince; it had an untamed imagination that could leap from place
to place and cross a continent at the bidding of a sign or the hint of a
line. The Elizabethan drama exprewssed the Elizabethan English, not the
Periclean Greeks or the Bourbon French; hence it became the national
art, while arts that followed alien models took no English root.</p>
<p>The English drama had to fight another battle before it could proceed
to Marlowe and Shakespeare. The nascent Puritan movement rejected the
Elizabethan stage as a home of paganism, obscenity, and profanity; it
de- nounced the presence of women and prostitutes in the audience, and
the propinquity of brothels to the theaters. In 1577 John Northbrooke
pub- lished a furious diatribe aga inst “dicing, dancing, plays, and
interludes,” writing:</p>
<p>I am persuaded that Satan hath not a more speedy way and fitter</p>
<p>school to work and teach his desire, to bring men and women into</p>
<p>his snare of concupiscence and filthy lusts of wicked whoredom, than
those plays and theaters are; and therefore it is necessary that those
places and players should be forbidden and dissolved, and put down by
authority, as the brothels and stews are.^®</p>
<p>Stephen Gosson’s Schoole of Abuse was relatively moderate, and ac -
knowledged some plays and actors to be “without rebuke”; but when Lodge
replied to him Gosson abandoned all distinctions, and in Players
Confuted hi Five Actions he described plays as “t he food of iniquity,
riot,</p>
<p>CHAP, III)</p>
<p>ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>and adultery,” and actors as “masters of vice, teachers of
wantonness.”®^ Critics saw in the comedies demoralizing pictures of vice
and rascality, and in tragedies stimulating examples of murder,
treachery, and rebellion.®* In the earlier years of Elizabeth’s reign,
Sunday was the usual day for plays; trumpets announced them just as
church bells called the people to after- noon prayer, and clergymen were
dismayed to find their congregations skipping services to crowd the
theater. “Will not a filthy play, with the blast of a trumpet,” asked a
preacher, “sooner call thither a thousand than an hour’s tolling of a
bell bring to a sermon a hundred?”®® And North - brooke procee ded: “If
you will learn … to deceive your husbands, or</p>
<p>husbands their wives, how to play the harlot . . . how to flatter,
lie . . . murder . . . blaspheme, sing filthy songs . . . shall you not
learn, at such interludes, to practice them?”^®</p>
<p>The dramatists replied with pamphlets, and by making fun of Puritans
in the plays, as of Malvolio in Twelfth Night. “Dost thou think, because
thou art virtuous,” asks Sir Toby Belch of the clown in that play,
“there shall be no more cakes and ale?” And the clown replies, “Yes, by
Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i’ the mouth, too!”*^ The
playwrights, even Shakespeare, continued to salt their tales with
violence, rage, incest, adultery, and prostitution; one scene in
Shakespeare’s Pericles shows a room in a brothel, whose general manager
complains that his personnel “with continual action are even as good as
rotten.”^®</p>
<p>The city authorities of London — some of them Puritans — thought the
Puritans had the better of the argument. In 1574 the Common Council
forbade the performance of plays except after censorship and licensing;
hence Shakespeare’s line about “art made tongue - tied by authority.”^®
Fortunately, Elizabeth and her Privy Council enjoyed the drama; several
lords had companies of players, and under this royal protection and a
lax censorship six troupes were licensed to produce plays in the
city.</p>
<p>Before 1576 theatrical performances had taken place chiefly on tempo-
rary platforms in the courtyards of inns, but in that year James Burbage
built the first permanent theater in England. It was called simply Tbe
Theatre. To escape the jurisdiction of the London magistrates, it was
located just outside the City proper, in the suburb of Shoreditch. Soon
other theaters rose: the Curtain (1577?), the Blackfriars (1596),
the</p>
<p>Fortune ( 1 599) . In this last year Richard and Cuthbert Burbage
demolished their father’s Theatre and raised the famous Globe in
Southwark, just across the Thames. It was octagonal in outer form but
probably circular within; hence Shakespeare could call it “this wooden
O.”^ All the London theaters were of wood before 1623. Most of them were
large amphitheaters, seating some two thousand spectators in several
tiers of encircling galleries, and allowing another thousand to stand in
the “yard” around the stage;</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, hi</p>
<p>these latter were the “groundlings,” whom Hamlet rebuked for their
“dumb - shows and noise.”<em>® In 1599 the price of standing room was o
ne penny, of a seat in the galleries two or three pence; a little more
bought a seat on the stage. This was a spacious platform projecting from
one wall into the center of the yard. At its rear was a “tiring,” or
attiring, room, where the actors donned their costumes and the “stage -
keeper” managed the properties. These included tombs, skulls, box trees,
rosebushes, caskets, curtains, caldrons, ladders, weapons, implements,
phials of blood, and some severed heads. Machines could let gods and
goddesses down from heaven or raise ghosts or witches up through the
floor; “rain” could be produced at the pull of a string, and “double
girts” could hang the sun in the sky.</em>® These properties had to make
up for the absence of scenery; the open and uncurtained stage forbade
any rapid change of the setting. In recompense the action transpired in
the very midst of the audience, which could almost feel itself a part of
the event.</p>
<p>The audience was no minor portion of the spectacle. Caterers sold</p>
<p>tobacco, apples, nuts, and pamphlets to the spectators; in later
days, if we may believe the Puritan William Prynne, the women were
offered pipes.*^ Women came to the plays in considerable number, not
deterred by pulpit warnings that such mingling was an invitation to
seduction. Sometimes — the class war interrupting the drama — the
groundlings threw the leavings of their collations at the dandies on the
stage. To understand an Elizabethan play we must remember that audience:
the sentiment that welcomed a love story, the hearty humor that wanted
clowns with kings, the swagger that relished rhetoric, the rough
vitality that enjoyed scenes of violence — and the nearness of the
three-sided stage, inviting soliloquies and asides.</p>
<p>Actors abounded. Strolling players might be seen in almost any town
on festival days, performing in the village square, the tavern
courtyard, a barn or a palace, and at wakes. There were in Shakespeare’s
day no actresses; female parts were played by boys, and sometimes an
Elizabethan audience could see a boy representing a woman disguised as a
boy or a man. In the aristocratic public schools the students presented
dramas as part of their training. Companies of such boy actors competed
with adult troupes by giving performances in private theaters for public
and paying audiences. Shakespeare complained of this competition,*® and
after 1626 it ceased.</p>
<p>To avoid being classed as vagrants, the adult actors were organized
in companies under the patronage and protection of opulent nobles —
^Leices- ter, Sussex, Warwick, Oxford, Essex. The Lord Admiral had a
company; so did the Lord Chamberlain. The actors were paid by their
patrons only for performances in the baronial halls; for the rest they
lived precariously on the earnings of their shares in their company.
Shares were unevenly divided; the manager took a third, and the leading
actors received the</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS 8l</p>
<p>Kon’s share of the rest. Richard Burbage, the most famous of these
“stars,” left property bringing 300 a year; his rival, Edward Alleyn,
founded and endowed Dulwich College, London. The celebrities of the
stage were re- warded also with public idolatry and a succession of
mistresses. In his diary for March 1602, John Manningham tells a famous
story:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when Burbage played Richard III, there was a</p>
<p>citizen gone so far in liking with him that before she went from
the</p>
<p>play she appointed him to come that night unto her by the name of
Richard III. Shakespeare, overhearing their conclusion, went before, was
entertained and at his game before Burbage came. Then, message being
brought that Richard III was at the door, Shakespeare caused</p>
<p>return to be made that William the Conqueror was before Richard</p>
<p>III.«</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE: 1 5 64-9 3</li>
</ol>
<p>The dramatists did not fare so well as the actors. They sold their
plays outright to one of the theatrical companies for some four to eight
pounds; they retained no rights to the manuscript, and usually the
company pre- vented publication of the text lest it be used by a rival
troupe. Sometimes a stenographer would record a play while it was being
acted, and a printer would publish from this report a pirated and
garbled edition, which</p>
<p>brought the author nothing but hypertension. Such editions did not
always bear the author’s name; hence some plays, like Arden of Faversham
(1592), have survived centuries of anonymity.</p>
<p>After 1590 the English stage was alive with plays of some moment,</p>
<p>though only a few exceeded a day’s run. John Lyly graced his comedies
with charming lyrics; the fairy enchantments of his Endymion prepared
for A Midsummer Nighfs Dream. Robert Greene’s Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay (1589?), dealing with the marvels of magic, may have exchanged
ideas with Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus (1588? 1592?). Thomas Kyd’s</p>
<p>Spanish Tragedy (1589?) told a bloody tale of homicide, leaving
hardly anyone alive at the end; its success inspired the Elizabethan
playwrights to rival the generals and the doctors in shedding blood.
Here, as in Hamlet, we have a ghost demanding revenge, and a play within
a play.</p>
<p>Christopher Marlowe was christened just two months before
Shakespeare. Son of a Canterbury shoemaker, he might have missed a
university educa- tion had not Archbishop Parker given him a
scholarship. During his col- lege years he was engaged as a spy by Sir
Francis Walsingham to check on plots against the Queen. His study of the
classics unsettled his theology, and his acquaintance with Machiavelli’s
ideas gave his skepticism a cynical</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>turn. Moving to London after receiving his M.A. (1587), he shared
a</p>
<p>room with Thomas Kyd, and joined the freethinking circle of Raleigh
and Harriot. Richard Barnes, a government agent, reported to the Queen
(June 3, 1593) that Marlowe had declared that “the first beginning of re
- ligion was only to keep men in awe . . . that Christ was a bastard . .
. that if there be any good religion, then it is in the Papists, because
the service of God is performed with more ceremonies . . . that all
Protestants are hypocritical asses . . . that all the New Testament is
filthily w ritten.” Furthermore, said Barnes, “this Marlowe . . . almost
in any company he Cometh, persuadeth men to atheism, willing them not to
be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins, and utterly scorning both God and
His min- isters.”®® For good measure Barnes (who was hanged in 1594 for
a “de - grading” offense) added that Marlowe defended homosexuality.®^
Robert Greene, in his dying appeal to his friends to reform, described
Marlowe as given to blasphemy and atheism.®* And Thomas Kyd, arrested on
May 12, 159 3, stated (under torture) that Marlowe was “irreligious,
intem - perate, and of cruel heart,” accustomed to “jest at the divine
Scriptures” and “gibe at prayers.”®®</p>
<p>Long before these reports were made to the government, Marlowe had
written and staged powerful dramas hinting at his unbelief. Apparently
Tamhurlaine the Great was composed in college; it was produced in the
year of his graduation, and its exaltation of knowledge, beauty, and
power reveal the Faustian temper of the poet.</p>
<p>Our souls, whose faculties can comprehend</p>
<p>The wondrous architecture of the world.</p>
<p>And measure every wandering planet’s course.</p>
<p>Still climbing after knowledge infinite.</p>
<p>And always moving as the restless spheres.</p>
<p>Will us to wear ourselves, and never rest</p>
<p>Until we reach the ripest fruit of all.®^</p>
<p>The two plays about Timur are crude with immaturity. The char-</p>
<p>acterization is too simplified — each person is one quality; so
Tamhurlaine is pride of power, and the pride is rather the conceit of a
collegian swollen with undigested novelties than the calm
self-confidence of a victorious sovereign. The story runs on rivers of
blood, obstructed with improbabil- ities. The style inclines to bombast.
What, then, made this play the greatest success, so far, of the
Elizabethan stage? Presumably its violence, blood- shed, and bombast,
but also, we may believe, its heresies and its eloquence. Here were
thoughts more boldly ranging, images more deeply felt,</p>
<p>phrases more aptly turned, than the Elizabethan stage had yet heard;
here were scores of those “mighty lines” that Jonson was to praise, and
passages</p>

<p>83</p>
<p>of such melodious beauty that Swinburne thought them supreme in their

<p>Quickened with acclaim, Marlowe wrote with all the intensity of his
spirit his greatest play, The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus
(1588?). Medieval ethics, perhaps recognizing that “the joy of
understanding is a sad joy,”^® and that “in much wisdom is much
grief,”®® had branded the unchecked lust for knowledge as a great sin;
yet medieval aspirations had braved this prohibition, even to calling
upon magic and Satan for the secrets and powers of nature. Marlowe
represents Faustus as a learned and famous physician of Wittenberg who
frets at the limits of his knowledge, and dreams of magic means that
will make him omnipotent:</p>
<p>All things that move between the quiet poles</p>
<p>Shall be at my command . . .</p>
<p>Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,</p>
<p>Resolve me of all ambiguities.</p>
<p>Perform what desperate enterprise I will?</p>
<p>ril have them fly to India for gold.</p>
<p>Ransack the oceans for orient pearl.</p>
<p>And search all corners of the new-found world</p>
<p>For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;</p>
<p>ril have them read me strange philosophy.</p>
<p>And tell the secrets of all foreign kings.®’^</p>
<p>At his call Mephistophilis appears and offers him twenty-four years
of limitless pleasure and power if he will sell his soul to Lucifer.
Faustus agrees, and signs the contract with blood from his cut arm. His
first requisition is the fairest maid in Germany to come to be his wife,
“for I am wanton - gests instead a succession of courtesans. Faustus
calls for Helen of Troy; she comes, and he swells into ecstasy.</p>
<p>Was this the face that launch’d a thousand ships.</p>
<p>And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?</p>
<p>Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss. . . .</p>
<p>O, thou art fairer than the evening air</p>
<p>Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars . . .</p>
<p>The final scene is rendered with great power: the despairing appeal
to God for mercy, for at least a term to damnation — “Let Faustus live
in hell a thousand years, a hundred thousand, and at last be sav’d!” —
and the disappearance of Faustus, on the stroke of midnight, in a fury
of clashing, blinding clouds. The chorus sings his epitaph — and
Marlowe’s:</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,</p>
<p>And burned is Apollo’s laurel -bough.</p>
<p>In these plays Marlowe might have purged his own passions for knowl-
edge, beauty, and power; the catharsis, or cleansing effect, that
Aristotle ascribed to tragic drama could better purge the author than
the audience. In The Jeiv of Malta (1589?) the will to power takes the
intermediate form of greed for wealth, and defends itself in the
Prologue spoken by “Mach - iavel”:</p>
<p>Admired I am of those that hate me most.</p>
<p>Though some speak openly 〔publicly〕 against my books.</p>
<p>Yet they will read me, and thereby attain</p>
<p>To Peter’s chair; and when they cast me off.</p>
<p>Are poison’d by my climbing followers.</p>
<p>I count religion but a childish toy.</p>
<p>And hold there is no sin but ignorance.</p>
<p>Barabas the moneylender is again one quality personified, greed
raised to hatred of all who hinder his gains, an unpleasant caricature
redeemed by majestic vices.</p>
<p>I learn’d in Florence how to kiss my hand.</p>
<p>Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog.</p>
<p>And duck as low as any barefoot friar.</p>
<p>Hoping to see them starve upon a stall.®®</p>
<p>Contemplating his jewels, he thrills at their “infinite riches in a
little</p>
<p>room.”®® When his daughter recovers his lost money bags he cries out,
in a confusion of affections anticipating Shylock, “O my girl, my gold,
my fortune, my felicity! There is a power, almost a fury, in this play,
a sting of epithet and force of phrase, that lead Marlowe now and then
to the very verge of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>He came still closer in Edward 11 (1592). The young King, just</p>
<p>crowned, sends for his “Greek friend” Gaveston, and lavishes kisses,
offices, and wealth upon him; the neglected nobles rise and depose Ed-
ward, who, driven to philosophy, calls to his remaining comrades:</p>
<p>Come, Spencer, come, Baldock, come sit down by me;</p>
<p>Make trial now of that philosophy</p>
<p>That in our famous nurseries of arts</p>
<p>Thou suck’dst from Plato and from Aristotle .</p>
<p>From this well-constructed drama, this poetry of sensitivity,
imagination, and power, these characters distinctly and consistently
drawn, this King</p>
<p>CHAP, hi)</p>
<p>ON THE SLOPES OF PARNASSUS</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>SO mingled of pederasty and pride and yet forgivable in his young
sim- plicity and grace, it was but a step to Shakespeare’s Richard II,
which fol - lowed it by a year.</p>
<p>What would this twenty-seven-year-old dramatist have accomplished had
he matured? A t that age Shakespeare was writing trifles like Love’s
Labour’s Lost, Tivo Gentlemen of Verona, and A Comedy of Errors.</p>
<p>In The Jevo of Malta Marlowe was learning to make every scene advance
an orderly plot; in Edward II he was learning to conceive character</p>
<p>as more than a single quality personified. In a year or two he might
have purged his plays of bombast and melodrama; he might have risen to a
broader philosophy, a greater sympathy with the myths and foibles of
mankind. His distorting defect was lack of humor; there is no genial</p>
<p>laughter in his plays, and the incidental comedy does not, as in
Shake- speare, serve its proper function in tragedy — to ease the
hearer’s tension before lifting him to greater tragic intensities. He
could appreciate the physical beauty of women, but not their tenderness,
solicitude, and grace; there is no vivid female character in his plays,
not even in the unfinished Dido, Queen of Carthage.</p>
<p>What remains is the poetry. Sometimes the orator overcame the poet,
and declamation shouted “a great and thundering speech.”®^ But in many a
scene the lucid verse flows with such vivid imagery or melody of speech
that one could mistake the lines for some Shakespearean stream of
fantasy. In Marlowe blank verse proved its elf as the English drama’s
proper vehicle, sometimes monotonous, but usually varied in its rhythm,
and achieving a seemingly natural continuity.</p>
<p>His ovni “tragical history” was now suddenly closed. On May 30, 1593,
three government spies, Ingram Frizer, Nicholas Skeres, and Robert
Poley, joined the poet — perhaps himself still a spy — at dinner in a
house or tavern in Deptford, a few miles from London. According to the
report of Wil- liam Danby, coroner, Frizer and Marlowe “uttered one to
the other</p>
<p>divers malicious words for the reason that they could not . . . agree
about the payment” for the meal. Marlowe snatched a dagger from Frizer’s
belt and struck him with it, inflicting some superficial cuts. Frizer
seized Mar- lowe’s hand, turned the weapon upon him, and “gave the said
Christopher then and there a mortal wound over his right eye, of the
depth of two inches … of which the aforesaid Christopher Morley then and
there in- stantly died”; the blade had reached ’the brain. Frizer,
arrested, pleaded self-defense, and he was released after a month.
Marlowe was buried on June i, in a grave now unknown.®* He was
twenty-nine years old.</p>
<p>He left, besides the Dido, two fragments of high excellence. Hero and
Leander is a romantic version, in heroic couplets, of the story Musaeus
had told, in the fifth century, of the youth who swam the Hellespont to
keep a tryst. “The Passionate Shepherd to His Love” is one of the great
Eliz -</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>abethan lyrics. Shakespeare made handsome acknowledgments to Mar-
lowe by putting snatches of that poem into the mouth of Sir Hugh Evans
in The Merry Wives of Windsor (III, i), and by a tender reference in</p>
<p>As You Like It (III, v) :</p>
<p>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</p>
<p>“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”</p>
<p>— which is line 76 of Hero and Leander.</p>
<p>Marlowe’s achievement was immense in its brief moment. He made blank
verse a flexible and powerful speech. He saved the Elizabethan stage
from the classicists and the Puritans. He gave their definite forms to
the</p>
<p>drama of ideas and that of English history. He left his mark on
Shakespeare in The Merchant of Venice, in Richard II, in love poetry,
and in a</p>
<p>tendency to magniloquent rhetoric. Through Marlowe, Kyd, Lodge,</p>
<p>Greene, and Peele the way had been opened; the form, structure,
style, and material of the Elizabethan drama had been prepared.
Shakespeare was not a miracle, he was a fulfillment.</p>
