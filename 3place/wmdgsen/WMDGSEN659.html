<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>XIsaac Newton</p>
<p>1642-1727</p>
<p>I. THE MATHEMATICIAN</p>
<p>H E WAS born in a small farm at Woolsthorpe, in the county of</p>
<p>Lincoln, on December 25, 1642 (Old Style) — the year in which</p>
<p>Galileo died; cultural, like economic, leadership was passing from
the south to the north. At birth he was so small that (his mother later
told him) he might have been put into a quart mug, and so weak that no
one thought he would live beyond a few days. 1 As his father had died
some months earlier, the boy was brought up by his mother and an
uncle.</p>
<p>At twelve he was sent to the public school at Grantham. He did
not</p>
<p>do well there; he was reported as “idle” and “inattentive,”
neglecting pre - scribed studies for subjects that appealed to him, and
giving much time to mechanical contrivances like sundials, water wheels,
and homemade clocks. After two years at Grantham he was taken from
school to help his mother on the farm, but again he skimped his duties
to read books and do mathematical problems. Another uncle, recognizing
his ability, sent him back to school, and arranged for Newton’s
admission to Trinity Col - lege, Cambridge (1661), as a subsizar — a
student who earned his expenses by various services. He took his degree
four years later, and was soon there- after elected a fellow of the
college. He dealt chiefly with mathematics, optics, astronomy, and
astrology; in this last study he maintained interest till late in his
life.</p>
<p>In 1669 his mathematics teacher, Isaac Barrow, resigned; and on Bar-
row’s recommendation of him as an “unparalleled genius,” Newton was
appointed to succeed him; he held this chair at Trinity for thirty-four
years. He was not a successful teacher. “So few went to hear him,” his
secretary recalled, “and fewer that understood him, that ofttimes he did
in a manner, for want of hearers, read to the walls.” 2 On some
occasions he had no auditors at all, and returned sadly to his room.
There he built a laboratory — the only one then to be found in
Cambridge. He made many experiments, mainly in alchemy, “the transmuting
of metals being his chief design”; 3 but also he was interested in the
“elixir of life” and the “philosopher’s stone.” 4 He continued his
alchemist studies from 1661 to 1692, and even while writing the
Principia ; s he left unpublished manu-</p>
<p>53i</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xscripts on alchemy totaling 1 00,000 words or more, “wholly devoid
of value.”® Boyle and ot her members of the Royal Society were
feverishly engaged in the same quest for manufacturing gold. Newton’s
aim was not clearly commercial; he never showed any eagerness for
material gains; probably he was seeking some law or process by which the
elements could be interpreted as transmutable variations of one basic
substance. We can- not be sure that he was wrong.</p>
<p>Outside his rooms at Cambridge he had a small garden; there he took
short walks, soon interrupted by some idea which he hurried to his desk
to record. He sat little, but rather walked about his room so much that
(said his secretary) “you might have thought him . . . among the
Aristotelian sect” of Peripatetics. 7 He ate sparingly, often skipped a
meal, forgot that he had missed it, and grudged the time he had to give
to eating and sleep- ing. “He rarely went to dine in the hall; and then,
if he had not been</p>
<ul>
<li>re〕 minded, would go very carelessly, with shoes down at the heels,
stockings untied . . . and his head scarcely combed.” 8 Many stories
were told, and many were invented, about his absent-mindedness. On
awaken- ing from sleep, we are assured, he might sit on his bed for
hours undressed, engrossed in thought. 9 When he had visitors he would
sometimes disappear into another room, jot down ideas, and quite forget
his company. 10</li>
</ul>
<p>During those thirty-five years at Cambridge he was a monk of science.
He drew up “rules of philosophizing” — i.e., of scientific method and
re- search. He rejected the rules which Descartes in his Discours had
set up as a priori principles from which all major truths were to be
derived by deduction. When Newton said, “ Non fingo hypotheses ” — I do
not in- vent hypotheses 11 — he meant that he offered no theories as to
anything beyond observation of phenomena; so he would hazard no guess as
to the nature of gravitation, but would only describe its behavior and
formulate its laws. He did not pretend to avoid hypotheses as cues to
experiments; on the contrary, his laboratory was devoted to testing a
thousand ideas and possibilities, and his record was littered with
hypotheses tried and re- jected. Nor did he repudiate deduction; he
merely insisted that it should start from facts and lead to principles.
His method was to conceive possible solutions of a problem, work out
their mathematical implications, and test these by computation and
experiment. “The whole burden of 〔natural〕 philosophy,” he wrote,
“seems to consist in this — from the phenomena of motions to investigate
the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the
other phenomena.” 12 He was a compound of mathematics</p>
<p>Nevertheless we proceed. His fame has two foci — calculus and
gravita- tion. He began his work on the calculus in 1665 by finding the
tangent and radius of curvature at any point on a curve. He called his
method not</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>533</p>
<p>calculus but “fluxions,” and gave for this term an explanation upon
which we cannot improve:</p>
<p>Lines are described, and thereby generated, not by the apposition of
parts, but by the continued motion of points; superficies 〔planes〕 by
the motion of lines; solids by the motion of superficies; angles by the
rotation of the sides; portions of time by continual flux; and so in</p>
<p>other quantities . . . Therefore, considering that quantities, which
in- crease in equal times, and by increasing are generated, became
greater or less according to the greater or less velocity with which
they in-</p>
<p>crease or are generated, I sought a method of determining quantities
from the velocities of the motions or increments with which they are
generated; and calling these velocities of the motions or increments
Fluxions, and the generated quantities Fluents, I fell by degrees upon
the Method of Fluxions … in the years 1665 and 1666. 13</p>
<p>Newton described his method in a letter to Barrow in 1 669, and
referred to it in a letter to John Collins in 1672. He probably used the
method in reaching some of the results in his Principia (1687), but his
exposition there (probably for the convenience of his readers) followed
accepted geometrical formulas. He contributed a statement of his
fluxions procedure — but not over his own name — to Wallis’ Algebra in
1693. Not till 1704, in an appendix to his Opticks, did he publish the
account just quoted. It was characteristic of Newton to delay
publication of his theories; perhaps he wished first to resolve the
difficulties suggested by them. So he waited till 1676 to announce his
binomial theorem,* though he had probably formulated it in 1665.</p>
<p>These deferments embroiled the mathematicians of Europe in a
disgrace- ful controversy that for a generation disrupted the
international of science. For between Newton’s communication of his
“fluxions” to his friends in 1669 and the publishing of the new method
in 1704, Leibniz developed a rival system at Mainz and Paris. In 1671 he
sent to the Academie des Sciences a paper containing the germ of the
differential calculus. 14 On a visit to London, January to March, 1673,
Leibniz met Oldenburg; he had already corresponded with him and Boyle;
Newton’s friends later be - lieved — historians now doubt 18 — that
Leibniz on this trip received some suggestion of Newton’s fluxions. In
June, 1676, at the request of Oldenburg and Collins, Newton wrote a
letter for transmission to Leibniz, explaining his method of analysis.
In August Leibniz replied to Oldenburg, including some examples of bis
own work in calculus; and in June, 1677, in a further</p>
<ul>
<li>By which any power of a binomial (an algebraic expression composed
of two terms connected by a plus or minus sign) can be found by an
algebraic formula instead of being worked out by multiplication. Newton
had been partly anticipated in this theorem by Viete and Pascal.</li>
</ul>
<p>534</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XTV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xletter to Oldenburg, he described his form of differential calculus,
and his system of notation, which differed from Newton’s. In the Acta
Eruditorum for October, 1684, he again expounded the differential
calculus, and in 1686 he published his system of integral calculus. In
the first edition of the Principia (1687) Newton apparently accepted
Leibniz’s independent dis - covery of calculus:</p>
<p>In letters which went between me and that most excellent
geometer,</p>
<p>G. W. Leibniz, ten years ago, when I signified that I was in the</p>
<p>knowledge of a method of determining maxima and minima, of draw- ing
tangents, and the like, . . . that most distinguished man wrote</p>
<p>back that he had also fallen upon a method of the same kind, and</p>
<p>communicated his method, which hardly differed from mine except … in
his forms of words and symbols. 16</p>
<p>This gentlemanly acknowledgment should have contracepted contro-
versy. But in 1 699 a Swiss mathematician, in a communication to the
Royal Society, suggested that Leibniz had borrowed his calculus from
Newton. In 1705 Leibniz, in an anonymous review of Newton’s Optic ks,
implied that Newton’s fluxions were an adaptation of the Leibnizian
calculus. In 1712 the Royal Society appointed a committee to examine the
documents involved. Before the year was out the Society published a
report, Com- mercium Epistolicum, asserting the priority of Newton, but
leaving open the question of Leibniz’ originality. In a letter of April
9, 1716, to an</p>
<p>Italian pri est in London, Leibniz protested that Newton’s scholium
had settled the question. Leibniz died November 14, 1716. Soon afterward
Newton denied, that the scholium “allowed him 〔Leibniz〕 the invention
of the calculus differ entialis independently of my ow n.” In the third
edition of the Principia (172 6) the scholium was omitted. 17 The
dispute was hardly worthy of philosophers, since either claimant might
have bowed to Fermat’s priority.</p>

<li>THE PHYSICIST</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematics, however wonderful, was only a tool for calculating
quanti- ties; it did not profess to understand or describe reality. When
Newton turned from the tool to the ultimate quest, he addressed himself
first to the mystery of light. His first lectures at Cambridge were on
light, color, and vision; characteristically he did not publish his
Opticks till thirty-five years later, 1704. He had no itch to print.</p>
<p>In 1666 he bought a prism at Stourbridge Fair, and began optical
experi- ments. From 1668 onward he made a succession of telescopes.
Hoping to</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>535</p>
<p>avoid some defects persisting in the refracting telescope, he made
with his own hands a reflecting telescope, on theorems set forth by
Mersenne (1639) and James Gregory (1662), and presented it to the Royal
Society at its request in 1671. On January 11, 1672, he was elected to
membership in the Society.</p>
<p>Even before making telescopes he had reached (1666) one of his basic
discoveries — that white light, or sunlight, is not simple or
homogeneous, but is a compound of red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. When he passed a small ray of sunlight through a
transparent prism he found that the apparently monochrome light divided
into all these colors of the rainbow; that each component color emerged
from the prism at its own specific angle or degree or refraction; and
that the colors arranged themselves in a row of bands, forming a
continuous spectrum, with red at one end and violet at the other. Later
investigators showed that various substances, when made luminous by
burning, give different spectra; by comparing these spectra with the one
made by a given star, it became possible to analyze in some degree the
star’s chemical c onstituents. Still more delicate observations of a
star’s spectrum indicated its approximate rate of motion toward or from
the earth; and from these calculations the distance of the star was
theoretically deduced. Newton’s revelation of the</p>
<p>Hardly foreseeing these results, but feeling (as he wrote to
Oldenburg) that he had made “the oddest if not the most considerable
detection which hath hitherto been made in the operations of nature,” 18
Newton sent to the Royal Society early in 1672 a paper entitled “New
Theory about Light and Colors.” It was read to the members on February
8, and aroused a controversy that crossed the Channel to the Continent.
Hooke had de- scribed in his Micro gr aphia (1664) an experiment similar
to Newton’s with the prism; he had not deduced from it a successful
theory of color, but he felt slighted by Newton’s ignoring his priority,
and he joined with</p>
<p>other members of the Society in criticizing Newton’s conclusions. The
dispute lingered on for three years. “I am so persecuted,” wrote the
thin - skinned Newton, “with discussions arising out of my theory of
light that I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so substantial a
blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow.” 19 For a time he was
inclined to “resolutely bid adieu to philosophy eternally except what I
do for my own</p>
<p>satisfaction.” 20</p>
<p>Another point of controversy with Hooke concerned the medium</p>
<p>through which light is transmitted. Hooke had adopted Huygens’ theory
that light traveled on the waves of an “ether.” Newton argued that such
a theory could not explain why light traveled in straight lines. He
proposed</p>
<p>536</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xinstead a “corpuscular theory”: light is due to the emission, by a
luminous body, of innumerable tiny particles traveling in straight lines
through empty space with a speed of 190,000 miles per second. He
rejected ether as a medium of light, but later accepted it as a medium
of gravitational force.* Newton gathered his discussions of light into
the Optic ks of 1704. Sig- nificantly, it was written in English (the
Principia was in Latin), and was addressed “to Readers of qui ck Wit and
Understanding not yet versed in Opticks.” At the end of the book he
listed thirty -one queries for further consideration. Query I suggested
prophetically: “Do not bodies act upon fight at a distance, and by their
action bend its rays, and is not this action strongest at the least
distance?”t And Query XXX: “Why may not Nature change bodies into fight,
and fight into bodies?”</p>

<li>THE GENEALOGY OF GRAVITATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The year 1666 was germinal for Newton. It saw the beginning of his
work in opt ics; but also, he later recalled, in May “I had entrance
into the inverse method of Fluxions; and in the same year I began to
think of gravity extending to the orbit of the moon, . . . having
thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orbit with
the force of gravity at the surface of the earth, and found them to
answer pretty nearly. … In those years I was in the prime of my age.”
21</p>
<p>In 1666 the plague reached Cambridge, and for safety’s sake Newton
returned to his native Woolsthorpe. At this point we come upon a pretty
story. Wrote Voltaire, in his Philosophic de Newton (1738):</p>
<p>One day, in the year 1666, Newton, then retired to the country,</p>
<p>seeing some fruit fall from a tree, as I was told by his niece,
Mme.</p>
<p>Conduit, fell into a profound meditation upon the cause which draws
all bodies in a line which, if prolonged, would pass very nearly</p>
<p>through the center of the earth. 22</p>
<p>This is the oldest known mention of the apple story. It does not
appear in Newton’ s early biographers, nor in his own account of how he
came to the idea of universal gravitation; it is now generally regarded
as a legend. More likely is another story in Voltaire: that when a
stranger asked Newton how he had discovered the laws of grav itation, he
replied, “By thinking</p>
<p>• Later physicists preferred Huygens’ undulating theory on the ground
that Newton’s corpuscular hypothesis did not account satisfactorily for
phenomena of diffraction, inter- ference, and polarization. Contemporary
physics would like to combine the two views to explain phenomena
apparently involving both corpuscles and waves. The photons or quanta of
today recall Newton’s corpuscles. The ether is at present in
disrepute.</p>

<p>537</p>
<p>of them without ceasing.” 23 It is fairly clear that by 1666 Newton
had calculated the force of attraction holding the planets in their
orbits as varying inversely with the square of their distance from the
sun. 24 But he could not as yet reconcile the theory with his
mathematical reckonings. He laid it aside, and published nothing about
it for the next eighteen years. The idea of interstellar gravitation was
by no means original with</p>
<p>Newton. Some fifteenth-century astronomers thought that the heavens
exert a force upon the earth like that of the magnet upon iron, and
that, since the earth is equally attracted from every direction, it
remains sus- pended in the sum total of all these forces. 25 Gilbert’s
De Magnete (1600) had set many minds thinking about the magnetic
influences surrounding every body, and he himself had written, in a work
that would be published (1651) forty-eight years after his death:</p>
<p>The force which emanates from the moon reaches to the earth,</p>
<p>and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the earth pervades
the</p>
<p>region of the moon; both correspond and conspire by the joint action
of both, according to a proportion and conformity of motions; but</p>
<p>the earth has more effect, in consequence of its superior mass.
26</p>
<p>Ismaelis Bouillard, in his Astronomia philolaica (1645), had held
that the mutual attraction of the planets varies inversely as the square
of the distance between them. 27 Alfonso Borelli, in Theories of the
Medicean Planets (1 666), held “that every planet and satellite revolves
round some principal globe of the universe as a fountain of virtue
〔force〕, which so draws and holds them that they cannot by any means
be separated from it, but are compelled to follow it wherever it goes,
in constant and continuous revolu- tions”; and he explained the orbits
of these planets and satellites as the resultant of the centrifugal
force of their revolution (“as we find in a wheel, or a stone whirled in
a sling”) countered by the centripetal attrac - tion of their sun. 28
Kepler considered gravity inherent in all celestial bodies, and for a
while he reckoned its force as varying inversely with the square of the
intervening distance; this would have clearly anticipated Newton; but
later he rejected this formula, and supposed the attraction to be di-
minished in direct proportion as the distance increased. 29 These
approaches to a gravitational theory were deflected by Descartes’
hypothesis of vortices forming in a primeval mass and then determining
the action and orbit of each part.</p>
<p>Many of the alert inquirers in the Royal Society puzzled over the
mathe- matics of gravitation. In 1674 Hooke, in An Attempt to Prove the
Annual Motion of the Earth, anticipated by eleven years Newton’s
announcement</p>
<p>53 »</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XI shall explain a system of the world, differing in many
particulars</p>
<p>from any yet known, answering in all tilings to the common rules
of</p>
<p>mechanical motions. This depends upon three suppositions: first, that
all celestial bodies whatsoever have an attractive or gravitating power
towards their centers, whereby they attract not only their own parts,
and keep them from flying from them, . . . but that they do also</p>
<p>attract all other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of
their</p>
<p>activity. . . . The second suggestion is this, that all bodies
whatsoever, that are put into direct and simple motion, will so continue
to move forward in a straight line, till they are by some other
effectual powers deflected. . . . The third supposition is, that these
attractive powers are so much the more powerful in operating, by how
much nearer the</p>
<p>body wrought upon is to their own centers. 30</p>
<p>Hooke did not, in this treatise, reckon the attraction as varying
inversely with the square of the distance; but, if we may believe
Aubrey, he com- municated this principle to Newton, who had already
arrived at it inde- pendently. 31 In January, 1684, Hooke propounded the
formula of inverse squares to Wren and Halley, who themselves had
already accepted it. They pointed out to Hooke that what was needed was
no mere supposition, but a mathematical demonstration that the principle
of gravitation would explain the paths of the planets. Wren offered to
Hooke and Halley a reward of forty shillings (00) if either would bring
him, within two months, a mathematical proof of gravitation. So far as
we know, none came. 32</p>
<p>Sometime in August, 1 684, Halley went to Cambridge, and asked New-
ton what would be the orbit of a planet if its attraction by the sun
varied inversely as the square of the distance between them. Newton
replied, an ellipse. As Kepler had concluded, from his mathematical
study of Tycho Brahe’s observations, that the planetary orbits are
elliptical, astronomy seemed now confirmed by mathematics, and vice
versa. Newton added that he had worked out the calculations in detail in
1679, but had laid them aside, partly because they did not fully accord
with the then current esti- mates of the earth’s diameter and the
distance of the earth from the moon; more probably because he was not
sure that he could treat the sun, the planets, and the moon as single
points in measuring their attractive force. But in 1671 Picard announced
his new measurements of the earth’s radius and a degree of longitude,
which last he calculated at 69.1 English statute miles; and in 1672
Picard’s mission to Cayenne enabled him to estimate the distance of the
sun from the earth as 87,000,000 miles (the present figure is
92,000,000). These new estimates harmonized well wi th Newton’s
mathematics of gravitation; and further calculations in 1685 convinced
him</p>
<p>ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>that a sphere attracts bodies as though all its mass were gathered at
its cen- ter. Now he felt more confidence in his hypothesis.</p>
<p>He compared the rate of fall in a stone dropped to the earth with the
rate at which the moon would fall toward the earth if the gravitational
pull of the earth upon the moon diminished with the square of the
distance between them. He found that his results agreed with the latest
astronomical data. He concluded that the force making the stone fall,
and the force drawing the moon toward the earth despite the moon’s
centrifugal impetus, were one and the same. His achievement lay in
applying this conclusion to all bodies in space, in conceiving all the
heavenly bodies as bound in a mesh of gravitational influences, and in
showing how his mathematical and mechanical calculations tallied with
the observations of the astrono- mers, and especially with Kepler’s
planetary laws.*</p>
<p>Newton worked out his calculations anew, and communicated them to
Halley in November, 1684. Recognizing their importance, Halley urged him
to submit them to the Royal Society. He complied by sending the Society
a treatise, Propositiones de Motu (February, 1685), which sum- marized
his views on motion and gravitation. In March, 1686, he began a fuller
exposition, and on April 28, 1686, he presented to the Society, in
manuscript, Book I ( De Motu Corporum ) of Philosophiae Naturalis</p>
<p>Principia Mathematica. Hooke at once pointed out that he had
anticipated Newton in 1674. Newton answered, in a letter to Halley, that
Hooke had taken the idea of inverse squares from Borelli and Bouillard.
The dispute waxed to mutual irritation; Halley acted as peacemaker, and
Newton soothed Hooke by inserting into his manuscript, under Proposition
IV, a scholium in which he credited “our friends Wren, Hooke, and
Halley” as having “already inferred” the law of inverse squares. But the
dispute so irked him that when he announced to Halley (June 20, 1687),
that Book II was ready, he added, “The third I now design to suppress.
Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady that a man had as
good be engaged in lawsuits as have to do with her.” Haliey persuaded
him to continue; and in September, 1687, the entire work was published
under the imprint of the Royal Society and its current president, Samuel
Pepys. The Society- being short of funds, Halley paid for the
publication entirely out of his own pocket, though he was not a man of
means. So at last, after twenty years of preparation, appeared the most
important book of seventeenth- century science, rivaled, in the
magnitude of its effects upon the mind of literate Europe, only by the

<p>•Kepler’s laws (1609, 1619): 1. The planets describe elliptical

<p>The preface explained the title:</p>
<p>Since the ancients (as we are told by Pappus) made great account</p>
<p>of the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things;
and the modems, laying aside substantial forms 〔of the Scholastics〕
and</p>
<p>occult qualities, have endeavored to subject the phenomena of nature
to the laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathe-
matics as far as it regards 〔natural〕 philosophy Therefore we
offer</p>
<p>this work as mathematical principles of philosophy; for all the
diffi-</p>
<p>culty of philosophy seems to consist in this — from the phenomena of
motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these</p>
<p>forces to demonstrate the other phenomena.</p>
<p>The viewpoint is to be strictly mechanical:</p>
<p>I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena of nature by</p>
<p>the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles, for I am
in-</p>
<p>duced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend upon</p>
<p>certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes</p>
<p>hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other,
and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each</p>
<p>other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-</p>
<p>tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here
laid down will afford some light either to that or some truer method of
philosophy.</p>
<p>After laying down some definitions and axioms, Newton formulated
three laws of motion:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion</li>
</ol>
<p>in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by
forces impressed upon it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The change of motion is p oportional to the motive force im-</li>
</ol>
<p>pressed, and is made in the direction of the straight line in
which</p>
<p>that force is impressed.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Armed with these laws, and the rule of inverse squares, Newton pro-
ceeded to formulate the principle of gravitation. Its current form, that
every particle of matter attracts everv other particle with a force
varying</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>54 1</p>
<p>directly as the product of their masses and inversely as the square
of the distance between them, is nowhere found in these words in the
Principia; but Newton expressed the idea in the general scholium that
closes Book II: “Gravity . . . operates . . . according to the quantity
of the solid matter which they 〔the sun and the planets〕 contain, and
propagates its virtue on all sides, . . . decreasing always as the
inverse square of the distances.” 33 He applied this principle, and his
laws of motion, to the planetary orbits, and found that his mathematical
calculations harmonized with the elliptical orbits deduced by Kepler. He
argued that the planets are deflected from rectilinear motions, and are
kept in their orbits, by a force tending toward the sun and varying
inversely as the square of their distances from the center of the sun.
On similar principles he explained the attraction of Jupiter upon its
satellites, and of the earth upon the moon. He showed that Descartes’
theory of vortices as the first form of the cosmos could not be
reconciled with Kepler’s laws. He calculated the mass of each planet,
and figured the density of the earth as between five and six times that
of water. (The current figure is 5.5.) He accounted mathematically for
the flattening of the earth at the poles, and ascribed the bulge of the
earth at the equator to the gravitational attraction of the sun. He
worked out the mathematics of tides as due to the combined pull of the
sun and the moon upon the seas; and by similar “lunisolar” action he
explained the precession of the equinoctial points. He reduced the
trajectories of comets to regular orbits, and so confir med Halley’s
prediction. By attributing gravitational attraction to all planets and
stars, he pictured a universe mechanically far more complex than had
been supposed; for now every planet or star was viewed as influenced by
every other. But into this complex multitude of heavenly bodies Newton
placed law: the most distant star was subject to the same mechanics and
mathematics as the smallest particles on the earth. Never had man’s
vision of law ventured so far or so boldly into space.</p>
<p>The first edition of the Principia was soon sold out, but no second
edition appeared till 1713. Copies became so scarce and hard to secure
that one scientist transcribed the whole work with his own hand. 34 It
was recognized as an intellectual enterprise of the highest order, but
some notes of criticism soured the praise. France, clinging to
Descartes’ vortices, rejected the Newtonian system until Voltaire gave
it a worshipful exposition in 1738. Cassini and Fontenelle objected that
gravitation was just one more occult force or quality; Newton propounded
certain relationships among the heavenly bodies, but he had not revealed
the nature of gravitation, which remained as mysterious as God. Leibniz
argued that unless Newton could show the mechanism by which gravitation
could act through apparently empty space upon objects millions of miles
away, gravitation could not be accepted as anything more than a word.
35</p>
<p>542</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XEven in England the new theory was not readily received.
Voltaire</p>
<p>claimed that forty years after its first publication hardly twenty
scientists could be found favorable to it. Whereas in France critics
complained that the theory was insufficiently mechanical as compared
with Descartes’ primeval whirlpools, in England the objections were
predominantly re- ligious. George Berkeley, in Principles of Human
Knowledge (1710),</p>
<p>regretted that Newton had thought of space, time, and motion as
absolute, apparently eternal, and existing independently of divine
support. Mechan- ism so pervaded the Newtonian system that there seemed
no place in it for God.</p>
<p>When Newton, after characteristic delays, agreed to prepare a second
edition, he tried to appease his critics. He assured Leibniz and the
French that he did not assume a force acting at a distance through empty
space; he believed in an intervening medium of transmission, though he
would not attempt to describe it; and he frankly confessed that he did
not know the nature of gravitation. It was in this connection that he
wrote in the second edition the oft misunderstood words “ Non fingo
hypotheses .” 38 “Gravity,” he added, “must be caused by an agent acting
constantly ac - cording to certain laws; but whether this agent be
material or immaterial I have left to the consideration of my readers.”
87</p>
<p>To further meet religious objections he appended to the second
edition a general scholium on the role of God in his system. He
restricted his mechanistic explanations to the physical world; even in
that world he saw evidences of divine design; the great machine required
some initial source of its motion, which must be God; moreover there
were, in the solar system, certain irregularities of behavior which God
periodically corrected as they arose. 88 To make room for such
miraculous interpositions Newton sur- rendered the principle of the
conservation of energy. The world machine, he now supposed, lost energy
in time, and would run down if God did not intervene to restore its
force. 80 “This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets,”
he concluded, “could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an
intelligent and powerful Being.” 40 Finally he moved toward a philosophy
that could be interpreted in either a vitalistic or a mechanistic
sense:</p>
<p>And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle
spirit which pervades and hides in all gross bodies; by the force
and</p>
<p>action of which spirit the particles of bodies attract one
another</p>
<p>at near distances, and cohere if contiguous; and electric bodies
operate to greater distances, as well repelling as attracting the
neighboring</p>
<p>corpuscles; and light is emitted, reflected, refracted, inflected,
and</p>
<p>heats bodies; and all sensation is excited, and the members of

<p>543</p>
<p>bodies move at the command of the will, namely by the vibrations</p>
<p>of this spirit, mutually propagated along the solid filaments of
the</p>
<p>nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from</p>
<p>the brain into the muscles. But these are things that cannot be
ex-</p>
<p>plained in a few words, nor are we furnished with that sufficiency of
experiments which is required to an accurate determination and</p>
<p>demonstration of the laws by which this electric and elastic
spirit</p>
<p>operates. 41</p>
<p>What was his actual religious faith? His professorship at
Cambridge</p>
<p>required allegiance to the Established Church, and he attended
Anglican services regularl y; but, says his secretary, “as for his
private prayers, I can say nothing of them; I am apt to believe his
intense studies deprived him of the better part.” 42 Yet he studied the
Bible as zealously as he studied the universe. An archbishop
complimented him — “You know more divinity than all of us put together”;
43 and Locke said of his knowledge of the Scrip - tures, “I know few his
equals.” 44 He left theological writings greater in bulk than all his
scientific works.</p>
<p>His studies led him to semi-Arian conclusions much like those of
Milton: that Christ, though the Son of God, was not equal in time or
power with God the Father. 45 For the rest, Newton was, or became, quite
orthodox. He seems to have taken every word of the Bible as the word of
God, and to have accepted the books of Daniel and Revelation as literal
truth. The greatest scientist of his age was a mystic who lovingly
copied out large passages from Jakob Bohme, and who asked Locke to
discuss with him the meaning of the “White Horse” in the Apocalypse. He
encouraged his friend John Craig to write Theologtae Christianae
Frincipia Mathematica (1699), which sought to prove mathematically the
date of Christ’s second coming, and the ratio between the highest
attainable earthly happiness and the believer’s rewarding bliss in
Paradise. 40 He wrote a commentary on the</p>

<p>He was in another sense an anomalous mixture: a man apparently ab-
sorbed in mathematical and mystical theory, and yet possessed of
practical ability and common sense. In 1687 he was chosen by the
University of Cambridge to go with others and protest to James II the
King’s attempt to have the University admit a Benedictine monk to a
degree without</p>

to dissuade the King, but the University must have approved Newton’s con
- duct of it, for he was chosen member for Cambridge in the Parliament

<ol start="1689" type="1">
<li>He served till the dissolution in 1690, and was re-elected in 1701,
but he took no memorable part in politics.</li>
</ol>
<p>His career was interrupted in 1692 by two years of physical and
mental illness. He addressed to Pepys and Locke letters complaining of
sleepless- ness and melancholia, expressing fears of persecution, and
mourning that he had lost “the former consistency of his mind.” 47 On
September 16, 1693, he wrote to Locke:</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Being of opinion that you endeavored to embroil me with women</p>
<p>and by other means, I was so much affected that when one told me you
were sickly and would not live, I answered, ’twere better if you</p>
<p>were dead. I desire you to forgive me for this uncharitableness. For
I am now satisfied that what you have done is just, and I beg your</p>
<p>pardon for having hard thoughts of you for it, and for
representing</p>
<p>that you struck at the root of morality in a principle you laid
down</p>
<p>in your book of ideas, and designed to pursue in another book,
and</p>
<p>that I took you for a Hobbist. I beg your pardon also for saying
or</p>
<p>thinking that there was a design to sell me an office, or to embroil
me. I am your most humble</p>
<p>and unfortunate servant,</p>
<p>Is. Newton 48</p>
<p>Pepys, in a letter of September 26, 1693, mentioned “a discomposure
in . . . head or mind” evidenced by a message he had received from
Newton. Huygens left at his death (1695) a manuscript in which he noted,
under date of May 29, 1694, that “M. Colin, a Scotchman, informed me
that eighteen months ago the illustrious geometer, Isaac Newton, had
become insane,” but had “so far recovered his health that he began to
understand the Principia.” Huygens sent the report to Leibniz in a
letter of June 8, 1694: “The good Mr. Newton has had an attack of
phrenitis which lasted eighteen months, and of which they say his
friends have cured him by means of remedies and keeping him shut up.” 49
Some have supposed that this nervous breakdown led Newton from science
to the Apocalypse, but we cannot say. It was said that “he never again
conce ntrated after the old fashion, or did any fresh work”; 80 yet he
solved almost at once, in 1696, a mathematical problem proposed by
Johann Bernoulli “to the acutest mathe - maticians in the world”; and he
did likewise with a problem set by Leibniz in 1 7 16. 81 His answer to
Bernoulli was sent anonymously through the Royal Society, but Bernoulli
at once guessed the author to be Newton, recogniz-</p>

<p>ing, he said, “ tanquam ex ungue leonem ” — the lion from his
toenail. In 1700 he discovered the theory of the sextant; he let it
remain unknown except by a letter to Halley, and it had to be reinvented
in 1730. And he seems to have filled creditably the difficult positions
to which he was presently appointed by the state.</p>
<p>Locke, Pepys, and other friends had for some time negotiated to
secure for Newton a governmental position that would get him away from
the confinement of his room and laboratory at Cambridge. In 1695 they
per- suaded Lord Halifax to offer him the post of warden of the Mint.
The appointment was no sinecure, and no act of charity; the government
wished to use Newton’s knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy in minting
a new coinage. In 1695 he moved to London, where he lived with his niece
Catherine Barton, the mistress of Halifax. 52 Voltaire felt that the
charm of this niece led Halifax, as chancellor of the exchequer, to make
Newton master of the Mint in 1699; 58 but this bit of gossip hardly
explains why Newton continued to hold that office through his remaining
twenty-eight years, and to the general satisfaction.</p>
<p>His old age should have been happy. He was honored as the greatest of
living scientists; not till our own time did any man of science enjoy
such wide acclaim. He was elected president of the Royal Society in
1703, and annually thereafter till his death. In 1705 he was knighted by
Queen Anne. When he rode in his carriage through the London streets
people gazed with awe upon his pink face, majestic and benevolent under
a mass of white hair; and they could not always see that he had expanded
out of proportion to his modest height. He enjoyed a good salary, £
1,200 a year, and invested his savings so wisely that he left ,£32,000
when he died, 54 though he had been generous in gifts and charity. He
surmounted successfully the South Sea Company fiasco. However, he was
moody, sometimes irritable, suspicious, secretive, always timid but
proud. 55 He loved privacy, and did not make friends readily. In 1700 he
proposed to a rich widow; nothing came of it, and he never married.
Highstrung and morbidly sensitive, he bore criticism painfully, resented
it sharply, and fought back stoutly in controversy. He was conscious of
his own work and ability, but he lived modestly until his salary and his
savings enabled him to have six servants and enjoy a high place in
London society.</p>
<p>In his seventy-ninth year he began to repay his debt to nature.
Diseases that respect no genius afflicted him — stone in the bladder and
urinary in- continence; at the age of eighty-three he suffered from
gout, and at eighty- four from hemorrhoids. On March 19, 1727, the pains
from the stone were so severe that he lost consciousness. He never
regained it, but died the next day, in his eighty-fifth year. He was
buried in Westminster Abbey after a funeral led by statesmen, nobles,
and philosophers, in a pall borne</p>
<p>54&lt;S the AGE OP LOUIS XIV (chap. XI</p>
<p>Xby dukes and earls. Poets swathed him in elegies, and Pope composed
a famous epitaph:</p>
<p>Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night;</p>
<p>God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.</p>
<p>Voltaire even in old age was moved when he told how, in his English
exile, he had seen a mathematician buried with the honors of a king.
56</p>
<p>Newton’s fame grew to almost absurd heights. Leibniz judged his
rival’s contributions to mathematics to be equal in value to all
previous work in that science. 67 Hume considered Newton “the greatest
and rarest genius that ever rose for the adornment and instruction of
the species,” 68 and Voltaire modestly agreed. 69 Lagrange called the
Principia “the greatest production of the human mind,” and Laplace
assured it for all time “a pre- eminence above all other productions of
the human intellect”; Newton, he added, was the most fortunate of men,
for there is only one universe, and one ultimate principle in it, and
Newton discovered that principle. 60 Such judgments are precarious, for
“truth,” even in science, wilts like a flower.</p>
<p>If we rank the greatness of a man by the least subjective test, the
spread and duration of his influence, Newton can be compared only with
the founders of world religions and pivotal philosophies. For a time his
in- fluence upon English mathematics was harmful, for his “fluxions” and
their notation proved less convenient than the calculus and notation
with which Leibniz prevailed on the Continent. For a century his
corpuscular theory of light seems to have impeded the progress of
optics, though some students now find much help in Newton’s view. 01 In
mechanics his work has proved endlessly creative. “All that has been
accomplis hed in mechanics since his day,” wrote Ernst Mach, “has been a
deductive, formal, and mathematical</p>
<p>Theologians at first feared the influence of the Principia on
religion; but Bentley’s Boyle lectures (1692), encouraged by Newton,
turned the new world-view to the support of faith by stressing the
apparent unity, order, and grandeur of the universe as evidences of the
wisdom, power, and majesty of God. However, the same Newtonian system
was accepted by the deists as strengthening their replacement of the
Christian theology with a simple acceptance of one God, or even their
identification of God with Nature and her laws. Probably the final
influence of Newton on re- ligion was injurious; despite his protests,
and his million words of theologi- cal writings, freethinkers supposed
that he had conceived a self-subsistent world, and had brought deity
into it as a comforting afterthought. In France especially, Newton’s
cosm ology, though presented deistically by</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX )</p>
<p>ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>Voltaire, encouraged the mechanistic atheism of many philosophes.
Between the decline of the Cartesian cosmogony in France (c. 1740) and
the rise of relativity theories and quantum mechanics in the twentieth
century, Newton’s “System of the World” met no serious challenge, and
seemed to be verified by every advance or discovery in physics or
astron- omy. So far as an outsider can understand such arcana, the
principal dis- sents of contemporary physicists from Newton’s mechanics
are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Newton took space and distance, time and motion, as absolute —
i.e., not varying in quantity according to anything outside themselves.
63 Einstein considered them relative — varying with the position and
motion of the ob- server in space and time.</p></li>
<li><p>Newton’s first law of motion apparently assumed that a body might
“continue in a state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line.”
But “rest” is always relative, like the rest of a traveler in a speeding
plane; all things move, and never in a straight line, for every line of
motion or action is deflected by surrounding bodies (as Newton
realized).</p></li>
<li><p>Newton thought of mass as a constant; some contemporary
physicists think of it as varying with the relative velocity of observer
and object.</p></li>
<li><p>“Force” is now looked upon as a convenient but not necessary con
- cept in science, which aims to content itself with describing
sequences, relations, and results. We do not and need not (we are told)
know what “it” is that passes from a moving object to an object that it
strikes; we need only record the sequences, and assume (never with
absolute certainty) that these will he in the future what they have
appeared to be in the past. Gravitation, in this view, is not a force
but a system of relationships among events in space and time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is a consolation to learn that these and other emendations of
Newton’s mechanics are of importance only in fields (such as
electromagnetic phe- nomena) where particles seem to move with a speed
approaching the velocity of light; elsewhere the divergence between the
old physics and the new may be safely ignored. Philosophers, cured of
certainty by history, may still retain a humble skepticism about
contemporary ideas, including their own; they will sense a fluent
relativity in relativity formulas; and they will remind all delvers in
atoms and stars of Newton’s own final e stimate of his epochal
achievement:</p>
<p>I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I</p>
<p>seem to have been only like a bov playing on the seashore, and
divert- ing myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a
prettier</p>
<p>shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all
undiscovered before me. 64</p>
