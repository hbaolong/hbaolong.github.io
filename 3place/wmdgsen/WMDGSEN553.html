the Philosophers</h4>
<p>i 774-1 807</p>
<p>I. VOLTAIRE FINALE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Twilight in Ferney</li>
</ol>
<p>H E was eighty in 1774. He had some fainting spells in these years;
we call them little strokes, he called them petites avertissements.
He</p>
<p>shrugged them off, being long since accustomed to dying; he lived on
and savored the adulation of kings and queens. Catherine the Great
called him “the most illustrious man of our age.” 1 Frederick the Great
reported in 1775: “People tear at one another in the struggle for the
busts of Voltaire at the manufactory of porcelain” in Berlin, “where
they do not turn them out fast enough to meet the demand.” 2 Ferney had
long since become a goal of pilgrimage for intellectual Europe; now it
was almost a religious shrine. Hear Mme. Suard after her visit in 1775:
“I have seen M. de Voltaire. The transports of St. Theresa never
surpassed those which I experienced on seeing this great man. It seemed
to me that I was in the presence of a god, a god cherished and adored,
to whom I had at last been able to show all my gratitude and all my
respect.” 3 When he passed through Geneva in 1776 he was nearly stifled
by the enthusiastic crowd that surrounded him. 4</p>
<p>He continued, even in his eighties, to take an interest in politics
and litera- ture. He celebrated the accession of Louis XVI with an Bloge
historique de la raison in which, by the device of prediction, he
suggested some reforms that might endear the new ruler to posterity:</p>
<p>The laws will be made uniform…. Pluralities [several benefices held
by one ecclesiastic], superfluous expenditure, will be cut away…. To the
poor who work hard will be given the immense riches of certain idle men
who have taken a vow of poverty. The marriages of a hundred thousand
[Protes- tant] families useful to the state will no longer be regarded
as concubinage, nor the children held illegitimate…. Minor offenses will
no longer be pun- ished as great crimes…. Torture will no longer be
employed…. There will cease to be two powers [state and Church], because
there can exist but one — that of the king’s law in a monarchy, that of
the nation in a republic…. Lastly, we shall dare to pronounce the word
tolerance. 5</p>
<p>Louis accomplished many of these reforms, barring the ecclesiastical.
Sin- cerely pious, and convinced that the loyalty of the Church was an
indispen- sable support of his throne, he deplored the influence of
Voltaire. In July, 1774, his government instructed the intendant of
Burgundy to keep watch on the aged heretic, and to seize all his papers
immediately after his death; Marie Antoinette sympathized with Voltaire,
wept at a performance of his</p>
<p>873</p>
<p>874 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>Tancrede, and said she would like to “embrace the author”; 6 he sent
her some pretty verses.</p>
<p>He had an optimistic spell when his friend Turgot was made controller
general of finance; but when Turgot was dismissed he fell into a dark
Pas- calian pessimism about human affairs. He recovered happiness by
adopting a daughter. Reine Philiberte de Varicourt was introduced to him
in 1775 as a girl whose family, too poor to provide her with a dowry,
was planning to send her to a nunnery. Her innocent beauty warmed the
old man’s bones; he took her into his menage, called her “Belle et
Bonne,” and found a hus - band for her — the young and moneyed Marquis
de Villette. They were mar- ried in 1777, and spent their honeymoon at
Ferney. “My young lovers are a joy to see,” he wrote; “they are working
night and day to make a little philosopher for me.” 7 The childless
octogenarian rejoiced at the thought of being a father, if only by
proxy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he composed his last drama, Irene, and sent it to the
Comedie- Frangaise. Its reception (January, 1778) created a problem. The
custom of the company was to stage each play in the order of its
acceptance; two other dramas had been received and approved before
Voltaire’s— one by Jean- Franc ois de Laharpe, one by Nicolas Barthe.
Both authors at once waived their prior rights to performance. Barthe
wrote to the company:</p>
<p>A new play by Monsieur de Voltaire has been read to you. You were on
the point of considering L’Homme personnel. There is only one thing for
you to do: do not think of my play any longer. I am aware… of the
prescribed procedure. But what writer would dare to call upon the rule
in a case like this? Monsieur stands above the law like a king. If I am
not to have the honor of making my contribution to the pleasure of the
public, the least I can do is not to stand in the way of the public
delight that will surely be occasioned by a new drama from the pen that
created Z dire and Merope. I hope you will stage this play as soon as
possible. May its author, like Sophocles, continue to write tragedies
until he is a hundred years old, and may he die as you, messieurs, live
— flooded with applause. 8</p>
<p>When news of this reached Voltaire he played lovingly with the idea
of going to Paris to direct the staging of his play. After all, there
was no official or express prohibition of his coming to Paris. What if
the clergy should attack him in their pulpits? He was accustomed to
that. What if they per- suaded the King to send him to the Bastille?
Well, he was accustomed to that too. What a joy it would be to see the
great city again, now the capital of the Enlightenment! How it must have
changed since his last flight from it twenty-eight years ago! And
besides, Mme. Denis, who had long since tired of Ferney, had often
begged him to take her back to Paris. The Marquis de Villette offered to
put him up in comfort in his hotel on the Rue de Beaune. A dozen
messages from Paris cried out: Come!</p>
<p>He decided to go. If the trip killed him it would only advance the
inevi- table triflingly; it was time to die. The servants of his
household, the care- takers of his farm, the peasants on his land, the
workers in his industrial colony, protested and mourned; he promised to
return in six weeks, but they were sadly sure that they would never see
him again; and what successor</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>would treat them as kindly as he had done? When the caravan left
Ferney (February 5, 1778) his dependents gathered about him; many of
them wept, and he himself could not hold back his tears. Five days
later, after a three- hundred-mile trip, he sighted Paris.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Apotheosis</li>
</ol>
<p>At the city gates the officials checked the carriage for contraband.
“By my faith, gentlemen,” Voltaire assured them, “I believe there is
nothing here contraband except myself.” 9 Wagniere, his secretary,
assures us that his master “had enjoyed all the way the best of health.
I never saw him in a more agreeable humor; his gaiety was delightful.”
10</p>
<p>Rooms had been prepared for him in the residence of M. de Villette at
the corner of the Rue de Beaune and the Quai des Theatins on the left
bank of the Seine. Immediately after alighting from his coach Voltaire
walked along the quay to the nearby home o f his friend d’Argental, now
seventy - eight years old. The Count was not at home, but he soon
appeared at the Hotel Villette. “I have left off dying to come and see
you,” said Voltaire.</p>
<p>When news spread through Paris that the man who had set the
intellectual tone of the century had come out of his long exile, the
room at the Hotel Villette was turned into a veritable court and throne.
On February 1 1, it was said, over three hundred persons called,
including Gluck, Piccini, Turgot, Talleyrand, Marmontel, and Mesdames
Necker, du Barry, and du Deffand. Franklin came with a
seventeen-year-old grandson, and asked the blessing of the patriarch for
him; Voltaire raised his hands over the boy’s head, and said in English,
“My child, God and liberty; remember these two words.” 14 When the
stream of visitors continued day after day Dr. Tronchin wrote to the
Marquis de Villette: “Voltaire is living now on his principal rather
than his interest, and his strength will soon be exhausted by such a way
of living.” This note was published in the Journal de Paris on February
19, apparently to keep the curious away. 15 Voltaire himself, at Ferney,
had pre- dicted what this triumph would cost him: “I would be dead in
four days if I had to live as a man of the world.” 16</p>
<p>Some clergymen thought it would be a good stroke to secure his recon-
ciliation with the Catholic Church. He was half willing, for he knew
that only those who had died in the arms of the Church could be buried
in con- secrated ground; and all the cemeteries in France were
consecrated ground.</p>
<p>876</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>So he welcomed a letter sent him on February 20 by Abbe Gaultier
asking for an interview. The abbe came on the twenty-first. They talked
for a while, to no known theological result; Mme. Denis begged the abbe
to go; Voltaire told him he might come again. On the twenty-fifth
Voltaire suf- fered a severe hemorrhage, spouting blood through mouth
and nose when he coughed. He bade his secretary summon Gaultier.
Wagniere confesses: “I avoided sending my letter, not wishing to have it
said that M. de Voltaire had shown weakness. I assured him that the abbe
could not be found.” 17 Wagniere knew that the skeptics in Paris were
hoping that Voltaire would not surrender to the Church at the last
moment; and perhaps he had heard of Frederick the Great’s prediction,
“He will dishonor us all.” 18</p>
<p>Tronchin came and stopped the hemorrhage, but for the next twenty-two
days Voltaire spat blood. On the twenty-si xth he wrote to Gaultier: “I
beg you to come as soon as you can.” 19 Gaultier came the next morning,
found Voltaire sleeping, and went away. On the twenty-eighth Voltaire
handed to Wagniere a confession of faith: “I die adoring God, loving my
friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting persecution.” 20 Gaultier
returned on March 2; Voltaire asked to be confessed; the abbe answered
that Jean de Tersac, cure of St.-Sulpice, had required him to get a
retraction before hear- ing the confession. Wagniere protested. Voltaire
asked for pen and paper, and wrote with his own hand:</p>
<p>I, the undersigned, having been attacked for four months past with
vomiting blood, and being, at the age of eighty-four, no longer able to
drag myself to church; and the cure of St.-Sulpice, having wished to add
to his good works this of having sent M. l’Abbe Gaultier, priest; 1 have
confessed myself to him; and [declare] that if God disposes of me, I die
in the Catholic religion in which I was born, hoping in the divine mercy
that it will pardon all my faults; and that if I have ever scandalized
the Church, I ask pardon of God and her. — Signed, Voltaire, the 2nd of
March, 1778, in the home of M. le Marquis de Villette. 21</p>
<p>M. de Vielleville and Abbe Mignot (a nephew of Voltaire) signed the
state- ment as witnesses. Gaultier brought it to the Archbishop at
Conflans (a suburb) and to the cure of St.-Sulpice, both of whom
pronounced it inade- quate. 22 Nevertheless Gaultier prepared to
administer Communion to Vol- taire, but Voltaire suggested that this
should be deferred, saying, “I am continually coughing blood; we must
guard against mingling my blood with that of the good God.” 23 We do not
know in what spirit— pious or whimsical — this was said.</p>
<p>On March 3 D iderot, d’Alembert, and Marmontel came to see the sick
man. When Gaultier called on that day, with instructions from his
superior to get a “less equivocal and more detailed” confession, he was
told that Vol - taire was in no condition to receive him. Gaultier
returned several times, but was each time turned away by the Swiss guard
at the door. On March 4 Voltaire wrote to the cure of St.-Sulpice,
apologizing for having dealt with a subordinate. On March 1 3 the cure
was received, but apparently nothing came of this visit except an
exchange of courtesies. 24 Meanwhile the hemor-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 877</p>
<p>rhages had ceased; Voltaire felt his strength returning, and his
piety declined.</p>
<p>On March 1 6 Irene was performed at the Theatre-Frangais. Nearly all
the court came, including the Queen. The play was not up to Voltaire’s
standard, but it was acclaimed nevertheless as a marvelous production
for a man of eighty-four. Voltaire, too ill to attend, was kept
notified, act by act, of the audience’s reaction; and on the seventeenth
a deputation from the French Academy brought him congratulations. By
March 2 1 he felt well enough to go out riding. He visited Suzanne de
Livry, Marquise de Gou- vernet, who had been his mistress sixty-three
years before. On the twenty- eighth he visited Turgot.</p>
<p>March 30 was his supreme day. In the afternoon he went to the Louvre
for a meeting of the Academy. “As he drove out from his house,” reported
Denis vo n Visin, a Russian writer then in Paris, “the carriage was
accom - panied as far as the Academy by an endless throng of people who
kept on applauding. All the Academicians came out to meet him.” 25
D’Alembert welcomed him with a speech that brought tears to the old
man’s eyes. Vol - taire was placed in the presidential chair, and was
elected by acclamation president for the April quarter. The session
over, he was escorted to his car- riage, which then moved with
difficulty to the Theatre-Frangais through an immense crowd that
repeatedly cried out, “Vive Voltaire!”</p>
<p>When he entered the theater, audience and actors alike rose to greet
him. He found his way to the loge where Mme. Denis and the Marquise de
Vil- lette were awaiting him. He sat behind them; the audience appealed
to him to make himself more visible; he took a seat between the ladies.
An actor came to the loge and placed a laurel wreath on Voltaire’s head;
he took it off and put it upon the head of the Marquise; she insisted on
his accepting it. Voices were heard in the audience: “Hail Voltaire!”
“Hail Sophocles!” “Honor to the philosopher who teaches men to think!”
“Glory to the de - fender of Calas!” 26 “This enthusiasm,” said
eyewitness Grimm, “this general delirium, lasted more than twenty
minutes.” 27 Then Irene was performed for the sixth time. At the close
the audience demanded a few words from the author; Voltaire complied.
The curtain rose again; the actors had taken a bust of Voltaire from the
foyer and placed it on the stage; now they crowned it with laurels, and
Mme. Vestrice, who had played Irene, read to Voltaire some laudatory
verses:</p>
<p>Aux yeux de Paris enchante</p>
<p>Regois en ce jour un hommage</p>
<p>Que confirmera d’Age en cige</p>
<p>La severe posterite.</p>
<p>Non , tu n’as pas besoin</p>
<p>d’ atteindre au noir rivage</p>
<p>Pour jouir de Vhonneur</p>
<p>de Pimmortalite.</p>
<p>V oltaire, regois la couronne</p>
<p>Que Von vient de te presenter;</p>
<p>11 est beau de la meriter</p>
<p>Quand c’est la France qui la donned</p>
<p>Before the eyes of enchanted Paris</p>
<p>Receive on this day a homage</p>
<p>Which a severe posterity will</p>
<p>Confirm from age to age.</p>
<p>No, you need not</p>
<p>reach the dark shore</p>
<p>To enjoy the honor</p>
<p>of immortality.</p>
<p>Voltaire, receive the crown</p>
<p>Which has been offered you;</p>
<p>It is beautiful to merit it</p>
<p>When it is France that gives it.</p>
<p>878</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>The audience asked that the verses be repeated; they were. During the
ap- plause Voltaire left his seat; all made way for him; he was led to
his carriage amid an enthusiastic multitude. Torches were brought, the
coachman was persuaded to drive slowly, and a crowd accompanied the
carriage to the Hotel de Villette. 29 So far as we know, there had never
been such a scene in all the history of French literature.</p>
<p>Mme. Vigee- Lebrun, who had witnessed all this, wrote: “The
celebrated</p>
<p>On April 7 Voltaire was taken to the “Nine Sisters” Lodge of the Free
- masons. He was initiated into membership without being required to
pass through the usual preliminary stages. A laurel wreath was put upon
his head, and the c hairman made a speech: “We swear to help our
brothers, but you have been the founder of an entire colony which adores
you and which overflows with your benefactions…. You, much beloved
brother, have been a Freemason before you received the degree,… and you
have ful- filled the obligations of a Freemason before you promised to
keep them.” 33 On the eleventh he returned Mme. du Deffand’s visit by
going to see her in her apartment at the Convent of St.-Joseph. She felt
his face with her seeing hands, and found only bones, but on the twelfth
she wrote to Horace Wal- pole: “He is as animated as ever. He is eighty
-four, and verily I think he will never die. He enjoys all his senses,
none is weakened. He is a singular being, and in truth far sup erior.”
34 When the nuns heard of his visit they denounced the Marquise for
desecrating their cloister with the presence of a man condemned by both
Church and state. 35</p>
<p>On April 27 he went again to the Academy. The discussion turned on
the Abbe Delill e’s version of Pope’s Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot; Voltaire
had read the original, and complimented the abbe on his translation. He
took the occa- sion to suggest that the Dictionary of the Academy be
revised to enrich the accredited language with hundreds of new words
that had come into re- spectable usage. On May 7 he returned to the
Academy with a plan for the new dictionary. He offered to take charge of
all words beginning with A, and proposed that each member undertake a
letter. On adjourning he thanked them “in the name of the alphabet”; the
Marquis de Chastellux re - plied, “And we thank you in the name of
letters.” 36 That evening he at - tended, incognito, a performance of
his Alzire; at the end of Act IV the audience applauded the actor
Larive; Voltaire joined audibly in the acclaim by crying out, “Ah, que
c’est bien /” (Ah, that is well done! ) The audience recognized him, and
for forty-five minutes the frenzy of March 30 was re- newed.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 879</p>
<p>Perhaps he did well to enjoy those last weeks of life at the expense
of his health, instead of shrinking into privacy to gain a few painful
days. He worked so ardently on his plan for a new dictionary, and drank
so much coffee — sometimes twenty-five cups in a day — that he could not
sleep at night. Meanwhile his stricture worsened; urination became more
painful and incomplete; toxic elements that should have been eliminated
passed into the blood, producing uremia. The Due de Richelieu sent him a
solution of opium, recommending it as an anodyne. Misunderstanding the
directions, Voltaire drank a whole flask of it at once (May 1 1). He
fell into a delirium that lasted forty-eight hours. His face was
deformed with suffering. Tron- chin was summoned, and gave him some
relief, but for several days Voltaire uttered no word and could hold no
food. He begged to be taken back to Ferney, but it was too late.</p>
<p>On May 30 Abbe Gaultier and the cure of St.-Sulpice came, prepared to
administer the final sacrament of the Church if Voltaire would add, to
his previous confession of faith, belief in the divinity of Christ. An
uncorrobo- rated story by Condorcet 37 described Voltaire as crying out,
“In God’s name, do not talk to me of t hat man!” Laharpe reported
Voltaire’s response as “Let me die in peace.” Desnoiresterres accepted
the usual account: the priests found Voltaire delirious, and departed
without offering him the sacra- ment. 38 Tronchin claimed that the last
hours of the philosopher were marked by extreme agony and cries of fury.
39 Peace came at eleven o’clock that night.</p>
<p>The Abbe Mignot, anticipating that his uncle’s corpse would be
refused interment in a Paris cemetery, seated it upright in a carriage,
and drove with it 1 10 miles out to the Abbey of Scellieres in the
village of Romilly-sur- Seine. There a local priest gave the body the
traditional religious ceremony, sang a High Mass over it, and allowed
its burial in the vault of the church.</p>
<p>An order of Louis XVI forebade the press to mention Voltaire’s death.
40 The French Academy asked the Franciscan friars to have a Mass said
for the dead man; permission could not be obtained. Frederick the Great,
as one skeptic for another, arranged to have a Mass said for Voltaire in
a Catholic Church at Berlin; and he composed a warm eulogy of his friend
and foe, which was read to the Berlin Academy on November 26, 1778.
Catherine the Great wrote to Grimm:</p>
<p>I have lost two men whom I never saw, who liked me, and whom I
honored — Voltaire and Milord Chatham. Not for a very long time, perhaps
never, will they — especially the former — find their equals, and never
their superiors…. A few weeks ago Voltaire was publicly honored, and now
they do not dare to bury him. What a man! The first of his nation. Why
did you not take possession of his body in my name? You should have sent
it to me embalmed. He would have the most splendid tomb…. If possible,
buy his library and his papers, including his letters. I will pay his
heirs a good price. 41</p>

<p>he remains of Voltaire were removed from the Abbey of Scellieres,
were taken to Paris, were carried through the city in a triumphal
procession, and were deposited in the Church of Ste.-Genevieve (soon to
be renamed the Pantheon). In the same year the Quai des Theatins was
officially rechris- tened the Quai de Voltaire. In May, 1814, during the
Bourbon Restoration, a group of pious ghouls secretly removed the bones
of Voltaire and Rous- seau from the Pantheon, put them in a sack, and
buried them in a dumping ground on the outskirts of Paris. No trace of
them remains.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Influence of Voltaire</li>
</ol>
<p>It began with the anticlerical moments in Oedipe (1718); it operates
al- most ecumenically today. We have seen it moving sovereigns:
Frederick II, Catherine II, Joseph II, Gustavus III, and in less degree
Charles III of Spain through Aranda, and Joseph II of Portugal through
Pombal. In the intellec- tual world of the last two hundred years it has
been equaled only by the influence of Rousseau and Darwin.</p>
<p>Whereas Rousseau’s moral influence was toward tenderness, sentiment,
and the restoration of family life and marital fidelity, the moral
influence of Voltaire was toward humanity and justice, toward the
cleansing of French law and custom from legal abuses and barbaric
cruelties; he, more than any other individual, spurred on the
humanitarian movement that became one of the credits of the nineteenth
century. To feel the influence of Voltaire on literature we need only
recall Wieland, Kellgren, Goethe, Byron, Shel- ley, Heine, Gautier,
Renan, Anatole France. Without Voltaire Gibbon would have been
impossible; and historians acknowledge his lead and inspira- tion in
giving less attention to the crimes of men and governments and more to
the development of knowledge, morals, manners, literature, and art.</p>
<p>Voltaire shared in begetting the French Revolution by weakening the
re- spect of the intellectual classes for the Church, and the belief of
the aristoc- racy in its feudal rights. But after 1789 Voltaire’s
political influence was overwhelmed by Rousseau’s. Voltaire seemed too
conservative, too scornful of the masses, too much of the seigneur;
Robespierre rejected him; and for two years the Social Contract was the
bible of the Revolution. Bonaparte felt the two influences in the usual
sequence: “Until I was sixteen,” he re - called, “I would have fought
for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire; today it is the opposite….
The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always
reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic.” 42 After the
restoration of the Bourbons the writings of Voltaire became an instru-
ment of bourgeois thought against the revived nobility and clergy.
Between 1817 and 1829 there were twelve editions of Voltaire’s collected
works; in those twelve years over three million volumes by Voltaire were
sold. 43 The Communist crusade under Marx and Engels once more gave the
leadership to Rousseau. In general the revolutionary movements since
1848 have fol- lowed Rousseau rather than Voltaire in politics, Voltaire
rather than Rous- seau in religion.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 88 1</p>
<p>The most profound and lasting influence of Voltaire has been on
religious belief. Through him and his associates France bypassed the
Reformation, and went directly from the Renaissance to the
Enlightenment. Perhaps that is one reason why the change was so violent;
there was no pause at Protestant- ism. Some enthusiasts felt that the
Enlightenment as a whole was a deeper reformation than that which Luther
and Calvin had effected, for it chal- lenged not merely the excesses of
sacerdotalism and superstition, but the very fundamentals of
Christianity, even of all supernatural creeds. Voltaire gathered into
one voice all the varieties of anti-Catholic thought; he gave them added
force by clarity, repetition, and wit; and for a time it seemed as if he
had pulled down the Temple in which he had been reared. The intellec-
tual classes throughout Christendom were moved by the philosophies to a
polite deism or a secret atheism. In Germany the yout h of Goethe’s
genera - tion were profoundly influenced. Goethe thought that “Voltaire
will always be regarded as the greatest man in the literature of modern
times, and per- haps of all times.” 44 In England a brilliant minority—
Godwin, Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Bentham, Byron, Shelley — felt
Voltaire’s influence, but by and large English deism had anticipated him
and dulled his point; moreover, English gentlemen felt that no cultured
mind would attack a religion that gave such calming solace to the weaker
classes and the weaker sex. In Amer- ica the founding fathers were
almost all disciples of Voltaire. There and in England the influence of
Darwin and modern biology has overlaid that of Voltaire in impairing
religious belief; and in our times the Christian theology suffers most
of all from the unparalleled barbarity of our wars, and the vic- torious
audacities of sciences that invade the very heavens that once housed
deities and saints.</p>
<p>To Voltaire, more than to any other individual, we owe the religious
toleration that now precariously prevails in Europe and North America.
The people of Paris thought of him not as the author of epochal books
but as the defender of the Calas and the Sirvens. After him no tribunal
in Europe would have dared to break a man on the wheel on such charges
and evidence as had condemned Jean Calas. Books like Emile were still
banned and burned, but their ashes helped to disseminate their ideas.
Religious censor- ship declined until it tacitly admitted defeat. If, as
seems possible, our chil- dren may have to fight all over again the
battle for the freedom of the mind, let them seek inspiration and
encouragement in the ninety-nine volumes of Voltaire. They will not find
there one dull page.</p>

<li>The Haunted Spirit</li>
</ol>
<p>Arriving in France May 22, 1767, after his unhappy sojourn in
England, Rousseau, almost at the end of his sanity, found some comfort
in the wel- come given him by the cities through which he and Therese
passed. Though</p>
<p>88z</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>he traveled under the pseudonym of Jean-Joseph Renou, and was still
legally under the ban decreed against him in 1762, he was nevertheless
recognized and honored; Amiens gave him a triumphal reception, and other
towns sent him the vin de ville.</p>
<p>Many Frenchmen — all nobles — offered him a home. First, Mirabeau
pere, who gave him a choice of twenty estates; Rousseau chose
Fleury-sous-Meu- don, near Paris. But the Marquis pestered him to read
the Marquis’ books; Rousseau fled, and took refuge with Louis-Frangois
de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, at Trye-le-Chateau, near Gisors (June 21,
1767). The Prince put the entire castle at Jean- Jacques’ disposal, and
even sent musicians to play soft music for him; Rousseau interpreted
this as an imputation on his sanity. He thought that Choiseul and the
Comtesse de Boufflers (mistress of the Prince) had joined Voltaire,
Diderot, and Grimm in conspiring against him; and indeed Voltaire had
accused him of setting fire to the theater at Geneva, which burned to
the ground on January 29, 1768. 45 Rousseau believed that everyone in
Gisors looked upon him as a criminal. He longed to be restored to
Geneva, and wrote to Choiseul asking him to persuade the Genevan Council
to make reparation to Rousseau for past injuries. 46 Choiseul sent him
an official permit to travel anywhere in France, to leave it and to
return to it at will. 47 Rousseau now thought of going back to England;
he wrote to Davenport inquiring would he be allowed to occupy the house
at Wooton again; Davenport answered, By all means.</p>
<p>Fearing for his life at Trye, Rousseau fled from it in June, 1768,
leaving Therese at the chateau for her own safety. He went by public
coach to Lyons, and lived there for a while with relatives of the Daniel
Roguin who had given him a refuge in Switzerland in 1762. Soon, however,
he isolated himself in the Golden Fountain Inn at Bourgoin-en-Dauphine.
On the door of his room there he wrote a list of the people whom he
believed to be con- spiring against him. He sent for Therese, received
her with joy and tears, and decided at last to marry her. It was done by
a civil ceremony at the inn on August 30, 1768.</p>
<p>In January, 1769, they moved to a farmhouse at Mouquin, near
Grenoble. There he composed the final, half-insane pages of the
Confessions, and cooled his nerves with botany. Therese found his temper
more and more difficult; she herself was suffering from rheumatism and
the vague ills some- times accompanying “change of life.” The newlyweds
had a quarrel so seri - ous that Rousseau departed on a long botanizing
trip, leaving her a letter that advised her to enter a convent (August
12, 1769). 48 When he returned and found her waiting for him their love
was renewed. Now he regretted that he had disposed of her offspring.
“Happy the man,” he felt, “who can rear his children under his own
eyes!” 49 To a young mother he wrote: “The sweetest way of life that can
possibly exist is that of the home…. Nothing is more strongly, more
constantly, identified with us than our family and our children…. But I
who speak of family, children —… madame, pity those whose iron fate
deprives them of such happiness; pity them if they are merely
unfortunate; pity them more if they are guilty!” 50</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>883</p>
<p>The winter at Mouquin was hard to bear in a farmhouse subject to all
the winds. Therese begged for Paris. On April io, 1770, the couple
resumed their odyssey. They spent a pleasant month at Lyons, where
Rousseau’s operetta, he Devin du village, was performed as part of a
celebration in his honor. They moved by slow stages through Dijon,
Montbard, Auxerre. At last, on June 24, 1770, they reached Paris. They
took rooms on the fourth floor of his former lodgings at the Hotel
Saint-Esprit, Rue Platriere — now called the Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau —
in one of the noisiest quarters of the city.</p>
<p>He lived modestly and quietly, copying music for income, and studying
botany; now (September 21, 1771) he wrote his letter of homage to Lin-
naeus. 51 When it became known that he was in Paris, old friends and new
devotees came to visit him: the Prince de Ligne (who offered him a home
on his estate near Brussels), Gretry and Gluck (who came to discuss
music with him), Goldoni the dramatist, Sophie Arnould the singer,
Gustavus the Crown Prince of Sweden, and young authors like Jean-Joseph
Dusaulx and Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. In 1777 he received
what Voltaire had coveted and missed — a visit from the Emperor Joseph
II. 52 His free entry to the Opera (as a composer) was restored, and he
went there occasionally, especially to hear Gluck. Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre described him (now sixty years old) as slender, well-
proportioned, with “lofty brow, and eyes full of fire;… profound sadness
in the wrinkles of the brow, and a keen and even caustic gaiety.” 58</p>
<p>Despite the promise he had made in 1762 to write no more books, Rous-
seau had been stung into renewed composition by the continued attacks of
his enemies. To answer these, and all the hostile gossip of Paris and
Geneva, he had undertaken the Confessions (1765). Now (November, 1770)
this was complete, and Rousseau, though as yet unwilling to publish it
in its en- tirety, was resolved that certain parts, relevant to the
attacks, should be made known in Paris. So in December he read to
Dusaulx and others, in his room, long passages from his greatest book;
the reading lasted seventeen hours, in- terrupted by two hasty
collations. 54 In May, 1771, he held another reading, before the Comte
and Comtesse d’Egmont, Prince Pignatelli d’Egmont, the Marquise de
Mesme, and the Marquis de Juigne. He concluded with a fiery
challenge:</p>
<p>I have written the truth. If any person has heard of things contrary
to those I have just stated, were they a thousand times proved, he has
heard calumny and falsehood; and if he refuses thoroughly to examine and
compare them with me while I am alive, he is not a friend to justice or
truth. For my part I openly and without the least fear declare that
whoever, even without having read my works, shall have examined with his
own eyes my disposition, char- acter, manners, inclinations, pleasures,
and habits, and pronounces me a dis- honorable man, is himself one who
deserves a gibbet. 55</p>
<p>Those who heard him concluded from his intense emotion that he was
nearing mental disorder. Dusaulx pronounced Rousseau’s suspicions and
recriminations unworthy of “the generous, the virtuous Jean Jacques”;
this</p>
<p>88 4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>criticism ended their friendship. 56 Other hearers carried echoes of
these read- ings into the salons of Paris, and some sensitive souls felt
that Rousseau had maligned them. Mme. d’tpinay wrote to the lieutenant
general of police:</p>
<p>I must inform you again that the person of whom I spoke to you
yesterday morning read his work to Messrs. Dorat, de Pezay, and Dusaulx.
Since he is using these men as confidants of a libel, you have the right
to let him know what you think of it. I feel that you ought to speak to
him with enough kind- ness so that he should not complain, but with
firmness enough so that he won’t repeat his fault. If you secure his
word of honor I believe he will keep it. Pardon me a thousand times, but
my peace of mind was at stake. 57</p>
<p>The police asked Rousseau to give no more readings; he agreed. He
con- cluded that he could never get a fair hearing in his lifetime, and
this feeling of frustration helped to unhinge his mind. After 1772 he
closed his door to nearly all visitors but Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. On
his solitary walks he suspected an enemy in almost everyone whom he
passed. Aside from such specters of hostility his essential good nature
remained. He subscribed, over Voltaire’s resistance, to the fund for a
statue to Vo ltaire. When an abbe sent him a brochure denouncing
Voltaire he rebuked the writer: “Voltaire,” he told him, “is without
doubt a bad man, whom I do not intend to praise; but he has said and
done so many good things that we should draw the curtain over his
irregularities.” 58</p>
<p>When he could take his mind off the “conspiracy” that he saw around
him, he could write with as much clarity as before, and with surprising
con- servatism and practicality. We have seen how the Polish convention
of 1769 asked his suggestions for a new constitution. He began his
Considerations sur le gouvernement de la Pologne in October, 1771, and
finished it in April,</p>
<ol start="1772" type="1">
<li>Our first impression of it is that it violates all the principles
for which he had fought so passionately. On rereading it in old age we
are comforted to see that Rousseau (then sixty) could also age and, as
the old would like to put it, mature. The same man who had cried out,
“Man is born free, and is everywhere in chains,” now warned the Poles,
whose “free veto” had con - demned them to anarchy, that freedom is a
trial as well as a dispensation, and requires a self-discipline far more
arduous than obedience to external commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>Liberty is a strong food, but it needs a stout digestion…. I laugh at
those degraded peoples who rise in revolt at a word from an intriguer;
who dare to speak of liberty while in total ignorance of what it means;
and who… imagine that, to be free, it is enough to be a rebel.
High-souled and holy liberty! If these poor men could only know thee; if
they could only learn what is the price at which thou art won and
guarded; if they could only be taught how far sterner are thy laws than
the hard yoke of the tyrant ! 59</p>
<p>Life and Montesquieu had taught Rousseau that such discussions as his
Social Contract are flights in vacuo, abstract theories without a hinge
on reality. All states, he now admitted, are rooted in history and
circumstance, and will die if their roots are indiscriminately cut. So
he advised the Poles to make no sudden changes in their constitution.
They should keep their</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>885</p>
<p>elective monarch but should limit their liberum veto; they should
keep Ca- tholicism as the state religion but develop an educational
system independent of the Church. 60 Poland, in the existing condition
of its communications and transport, seemed to him too large to be ruled
from one center; better divide it into three states federated only in
mutual contacts and foreign af- fairs. He who had once denounced private
property as the source of all evils now sanctioned Polish feudalism; he
proposed to tax all land, but to leave present property rights intact.
He hoped th?’ serfdom would one day be abolished, but he did not
advocate its early end; that, he thought, should wait until the serf had
had more education. Everything, he insisted, de- pended upon the
extension o. :ducation; to promote freedom faster than intel- ligence
and moral character would be an open sesame to chaos and partition.</p>
<p>The partition was effected before Rousseau could finish his essay; in
Po- land, as in Corsica, Realpolitik ignored his philosophical
legislation. This double frustration shared in embittering his final
years, and it intensified his scorn of those philo sophes who had
praised as enlightened despots and phi- losopher kings those rulers —
Frederick II, Catherine II, and Joseph II — who were dismembering
Poland.</p>
<p>In 1772 he began another attempt to answer his enemies. He called it
Dialogues: Rousseau juge de Jean-Jacques. He worked on this 540-page
book, on and off, for four years, and his mind darkened more and more as
he proceeded. The foreword begged the reader to read all three dialogues
thoroughly; “consider that this grace, which is asked of you by a heart
burdened with sorrow, is a debt of justice which Heaven imposes upon
you.” 61 He admitted the “long -windedness, the repetitions, the
verbiage, and the disorder of this composition,” 62 but for fifteen
years past (he said) there</p>
<p>To the final dialogue he added a chapter entitled “The History of
This Work.” He told how, to bring his book to the attention of Paris and
Ver - sailles, he resolved to deposit a copy of the manuscript, with an
address to Providence, on the high altar in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.
This he</p>
<p>886</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>ried to do on February 24, 1776. Finding the sanctuary barred by a
railing, he sought side entrances to it; finding these locked, he grew
dizzy, ran out of the church, and wandered in the streets in
semi-delirium for hours before reaching his rooms. 68 He composed a plea
to the French people, entitled it “To All Frenchmen Who Still Love
Justice and Truth,” copied it on hand - bills, and distributed these to
passers-by in the streets. Several of these re- fused it, saying that it
was not addressed to them. 69 He gave up his efforts, and resigned
himself to defeat.</p>
<p>His excitement abated now that he was reconciled. He wrote at this
time ( 1 777 — 78) his most beautiful book, Reveries d’un promeneur
solitaire. He told how the people of Motiers had rejected him and had
stoned his house, and how he had retired to the He de St.-Pierre in the
Lake of Bienne. There he had found happiness; and now, looking back upon
that retreat, he pic- tured the quiet water, the inflowing streams, the
verdure-covered island, and the polymorphous sky. He struck a new
romantic note by suggesting that the meditative spirit may always find
in nature something responsive to its mood. As we read those pages we
ask ourselves, Could a man half insane write so well, so lucidly, at
times so serenely? But then the old plaints recur, and Rousseau mourns
again that he had cast off his children, that he had not had the simple
courage to bring up a family. He saw a child playing; he re- turned to
his room and “wept and expiated.” 70</p>
<p>In those last years at Paris he envied the religious faith that
lifted the life of the common people about him into a drama of death and
resurrection. Sometimes he attended Catholic services. He visited a
hermitage with Ber- nardin de Saint- Pierre, and heard the monks
reciting a litany. “Ah, how happy the man who can believe!” 71 He could
not believe, 72 but he tried to behave like a Christian, giving alms,
visiting and comforting the sick. 73 He read and annotated Thomas a
Kempis’ The Imitation of Christ.</p>
<p>Bitterness diminished in him as he approached death. When Voltaire
ar- rived in Paris and received so many honors, Rousseau was jealous,
but spoke well of his old enemy. He rebuked an acquaintance who had
ridiculed the coronation of Voltaire at the Theatre- Fran§ais: “How dare
you mock the honors rendered to Voltaire in the temple of which he is
the god, and by the priests who for fifty years have been living off his
masterpieces?” 74 When he heard that Voltaire was dying he predicted,
“Our lives were linked to each other; I shall not survive him long.”
75</p>
<p>When the spring of 1778 began to flower he asked that someone offer
him a home in the country. Marquis Rene de Girardin invited him to
occupy a cottage near his chateau at Ermenonville, some thirty miles
from Paris. Jean-Jacques and Therese went on May 20. There he gathered
botanical specimens, and taught bo tany to the Marquis’ ten -year-old
son. On July 1 he dined heartily with the family of his host. The next
morning he suffered an apoplectic stroke, and fell to the floor. Therese
lifted him onto his bed, but he fell from it, and struck the tiled floor
so sharply that his head was cut and blood poured out. Therese cried out
for help; the Marquis came, and found Rousseau dead.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV )</p>
<p>DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>887</p>
<p>Falsehoods pursued him to the end. Grimm and others spread the tale
that Rousseau had committed suicide; Mme. de Stael later added that he
had killed himself in grief over discovering Therese’s infidelity. This
was an es - pecially cruel story, for Therese’s comment, soon after his
death, revealed</p>
<p>On July 4, 1778, he was buried on the Isle of Poplars in a small lake
on the Girardin estate. For a long time this He des Peupliers was a goal
of pious pilgrimage; all the world of fashion — even the Queen — went
out to worship at Rousseau’s tomb. On October 1 1, 1794, his remains
were removed to the Pantheon, and were laid near those of Voltaire. From
that haven of neigh- borly peace their spirits rose to renew their war
for the soul of the Revolu- tion, of France, and of Western man.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Influence of Rousseau</li>
</ol>
<p>So we end as we began, by contemplating, now in substantiation, the
in- credible effect of Rousseau upon the literature, pedagogy,
philosophy, reli- gion, morals, manners, art, and politics of the
century that began with his death. Today much that he wrote seems
exaggerated, sentimental, or absurd; only the Confessions and the
Reveries move us; but till yesterday his every word was being heard in
one or another field of European or American thought. Rousseau, said
Mme. de Stael, “invented nothing, but he set every - thing on fire.”
76</p>
<p>First of all, of course, he was the mother of the Romantic movement.
We have seen many others sowing its seed: Thomson, Collins, Gray,
Richard- son, Prevost, and Christianity itself, whose theology and art
are the most marvelous romance of all. Rousseau matured the seeds in the
hothouse of his emotions, and delivered the offspring, full-grown and
fertile from birth, in the Discourses, La Nouvelle Helo’ise, the Contrat
social, Emile, and the Con- fessions.</p>
<p>But what shall we mean by the Romantic movement? The rebellion of
feeling against reason, of instinct against intellect, of sentiment
against judg- ment, of the subject against the object, of subjectivism
against objectivity, of solitude against society, of imagination against
reality, of myth and legend against history, of religion against
science, of mysticism against ritual, of poetry and poetic prose against
prose and prosaic poetry, of neo-Gothic against neoclassical art, of the
feminine against the masculine, of romantic love against the marriage of
convenience, of “Nature” and the “natural”</p>
<p>888</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>Now nearly every one of these elements found voice and sanction in
Rousseau, and some support in the needs and spirit of the time. France
had wearied of classic reason and aristocratic restraint. Rousseau’s
exaltation of feeling offered liberation to suppressed instincts, to
repressed sentiment, to oppressed individuals and classes. The
Concessions became the bible of the Age of Feeling as the Encyclopedic
had been the New Testament of the Age of Reason. Not that Rousseau
rejected reason; on the contrary, he called it a divine gift, and
accepted it as final judge; 77 but (he felt) its cold light needed the
warmth of the heart to inspire action, greatness, and virtue.
“Sensibility” became the watchword of women and men. Women learned to
faint, men to weep, more readily than before. They oscillated between
joy and grief, and mingled both in their tears.</p>
<p>The Rousseauian revolution began at the mother’s breasts, which were
now to be freed from stays; this part of the revolution, however, proved
the hardest of all, and was won only after more than a century of
alternat- ing imprisonment and release. After Emile French mothers
nursed their in- fants, even at the opera, between arias. 78 The child
was freed from swaddling clothes, and was brought up directly by the
parents. When it went to school it enjoyed — more in Switzerland than in
France — education a la Rousseau. Since man was now considered good by
nature, the pupil was to be viewed not as an imp of the perverse but as
an angel whose wishes were the voice of God. His senses were no longer
condemned as the instruments of Satan, but as doors to illuminating
experiences and a thousand harmless delights. Class- rooms were no
longer to be prisons. Education was to be made natural and pleasant,
through the unfolding and encouragement of inherent curiosities and
powers. The stuffing of the memory with facts, the stifling of the mind
with dogmas, were to be replaced by training in the arts of perceiving,
cal- culating, and reasoning. As far as possible children were to learn
not from books but from things — from plants in the field, rocks in the
soil, clouds and stars in the skies. E nthusiasm for Rousseau’s
educational ideas stimulated Pestalozzi and Lavater in Switzerland,
Basedow in Germany, Maria Montes- sori in Italy, John Dewey in America;
“progressive education” is part of the legacy of Rousseau. Inspired by
Rousseau, Friedrich Froebel established the kindergarten system in
Germany, whence it spread throughout the Western world.</p>
<p>Some breath of the Rousseauian afflatus reached art. The exaltation
of children influenced Greuze and A4me. Vigee-Lebrun; the paintings of
the Pre-Raphaelites in England reflected the cult of pathos and mystery.
Deeper was the effect on morals and manners. There was some growth in
the warmth and fidelity of friendship, in mutual sacrifices and
solicitude. Ro- mantic love captured literature and made its way into
life. Husbands could now love their wives without flouting convention;
parents could love their children; the family was restored. “People had
been smiling at adultery; Rousseau dared to make it a crime” 79 ; it
continued, but was no longer de rigueur. The idolatry of courtesans was
replaced by pity for prostitutes. Contempt for convention resisted the
tyranny of etiquette. Bourgeois vir-</p>

<p>ues came into repute: industry, thrift, simplicity of manners and
dress. Soon France would lengthen its culottes into trousers and be
sans-culottes in pants as well as in politics. Rousseau shared with
English horticulture in changing French gardens from Renaissance
regularity to romantic curves and surpris- ing turns, and sometimes to
wild and “natural” disarray. Men and women went out from the city to the
country, and married the moods of Nature to their own. Men climbed
mountains. They sought solitude and fondled their egos.</p>
<p>Literature surrendered almost en masse to Rousseau and the Romantic
wave. Goethe bathed Werther in love, nature, and tears (1774), and made
Faust compress half of Rousseau in three words: “Gefiihl ist A lies”—
feeling is all. “Emile and its sentiments,” he recalled in 1787, “had a
universal influ - ence on the cultivated mind.” 80 Schiller stressed the
revolt against law in The</p>
<p>Half the philosophy of the century between La Nouvelle Heloise (1761)
and Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859) is colored with the revolt of Rous
- seau against the rationalism of the Enlightenment. Indeed, in a letter
of 1751 to Bordes, Rousseau had already expressed his scorn of
philosophy. 83 He based this contempt on what he felt to be the
impotence of reason to teach men virtue. Reason seems to have no moral
sense; it will labor to defend any desire, however corrupt. Something
else is needed — an inborn consciousness of right and wrong; and even
this conscience has to be warmed with feeling if it is to engender
virtue and make not a clever calculator but a good man.</p>
<p>This, of course, had been said by Pascal, but Pascal had been
rejected by Voltaire, and in Germany the “rationalism” of Wolff was
rising in the uni - versities. When Immanuel Kant became professor at
Konigsberg he had already been convinced by Hume and the philosophes
that reason alone could give no adequate defense of even the
fundamentals of the Christian theology. In Rousseau he found a way to
save those fundamentals: deny the validity of reason in the
suprasensible world; affirm the independence of mind, the primacy of
will, and the absoluteness of innate conscience; and deduce the freedom
of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of God from
man’s feeling of unconditional obligation to the moral law.</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>Kant acknowledged his debt to Rousseau, hung a picture of him on his
study wall, and declared him the Newton of the moral world. 84 Other
Germans felt the spirit of Rousseau upon them: Jacobi in his
Gefiihlphilosophie, Schleiermacher in his web-weaving mysticism,
Schopenhauer in his en- thronement of the will. The history of
philosophy since Kant has been a con- test between Rousseau and
Voltaire.</p>
<p>Religion began by banning Rousseau, and went on to use him as its
savior. Protestant leaders joined Catholic in declaring him an infidel;
he was classed with Voltaire and Bayle a s “spreading the poison of
error and impiety.” 85 Yet even in his lifetime there were laymen and
clergymen who took comfort in hearing that the Savoyard Vicar had
accepted with ardor the cardinal doctrines of Christianity, and had
counseled doubters to return to their na- tive faiths. On his flight
from Switzerland in 1765 Rousseau was welcomed by the bishop of
Strasbourg. After his return from England he found some French Catholics
gratefully quoting him against unbelievers, and holding hopes for his
triumphant conversion.</p>
<p>The theorists of the French Revolution tried to establish a morality
inde- pendent of religious creeds; Robespierre, following Rousseau, gave
up this attempt as a failure, and sought the support of religious
beliefs in maintain- ing moral order and social content. He condemned
the philosophes as re- jecting God but keeping kings; Rousseau (said
Robespierre) had risen above these cowards, had bravely attacked all
kings, and had spoken in defense of God and immortality. 86</p>
<p>In 1793 the rival legacies of Voltaire and Rousseau came to decision
in the struggle between Jacques-Rene Hebert and Maximilien Robespierre.
Hebert, a leader of the Paris Commune, followed Voltairean rationalism,
encouraged the desecration of churches, and set up the public worship of
the Goddess of Reason (1793). Robespierre had seen Rousseau in the
philosopher’s final stay in Paris. He apostrophized Jean- Jacques:
“Divine man!… I looked upon your august features;… I understood all the
griefs of a noble life devoted to the worship of truth.” 87 When
Robespierre rose to power he persuaded the National Convention to adopt
the Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar as the official religion
of the French nation; and in May, 1794, he inaugurated, in memory of
Rousseau, the Festival of the Supreme Being. When he sent Hebert and
others to the guillotine on a “charge of athe- ism, he felt that he was
following to the letter the counsels of Rousseau.</p>
<p>The agnostic Napoleon agreed with Robespierre on the need of
religion, and realigned the French government with God (1802). The
Catholic Church was fully restored with the French Bourbon Restoration
(1814); it won the powerful pens of Chateaubriand, de Maistre,
Lamartine, and La- mennais; but now the old faith leaned more and more
on the rights of feel- ing rather than the arguments of theology; it
fought Voltaire and Diderot with Pascal and Rousseau. Christianity,
which had seemed moribund in 1760, flourished again in Victorian England
and Restoration France.</p>
<p>Politically we are only now emerging from the age of Rousseau. The
first sign of his political influence was in the wave of public sympathy
that sup-</p>

<p>DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>891</p>
<p>ported active French aid to the American Revolution. Jefferson
derived the Declaration of Independence from Rousseau as well as from
Locke and Montesquieu. As ambassador to France (1785-89) he absorbed
much from both Voltaire and Rousseau; he echoed Jean-Jacques in
supposing that the North American Indians “enjoy in their general mass
an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under
European governments.” 88 The success of the American Revolution raised
the prestige of Rousseau’s political philosophy.</p>
<p>According to Mme. de Stael, Napoleon ascribed the French Revolution
more to Rousseau than to any other writer. 89 Edmund Burke thought that
in the French Revolutionary Constituent Assembly ( 1 789-9 1 )</p>
<p>here is a great dispute, among their leaders, which of them is the
best re- semblance of Rousseau. In truth, they all resemble him…. Him
they study, him they meditate; him they turn over in all the time they
can spare from the laborious mischief of the day or the debauches of the
night. Rousseau is their canon of Holy Writ;… to him they erect their
first statue. 90</p>
<p>Mallet Dupan in 1799 recalled that</p>
<p>Rousseau had a hundred times more readers among the middle and lower
classes than Voltaire. He alone inoculated the French with the doctrine
of the sovereignty of the people…. It would be difficult to cite a
single revolution- ist who was not transported over these anarchical
theories, and who did not burn with ardor to realize them…. I heard
Marat in 1788 read and comment on the Contrat social in the public
streets to the applause of an enthusiastic auditory. 91</p>
<p>Throughout France orators quoted Rousseau in preaching the
sovereignty of the people; it was partly the ecstatic welcome given to
this doctrine that enabled the Revolution to survive for a decade
despite its enemies and its excesses.</p>
<p>Through all the alternations of revolutions and reaction, Rousseau’s
influ - ence on politics continued. Because of his contradictions, and
because of the force and passion with which he proclaimed them, he
served as prophet and saint to anarchists and socialists alike; for both
these opposed gospels found nourishment in his condemnation of the rich
and his sympathy for the poor. The individualism of the first Discourse,
and its rejection of “civilization,” inspired rebels from Paine, Godwin,
and Shelley to Tolstoi, Kropotkin, and Edward Carpenter. “At fifteen,”
said Tolstoi, “I carried around my neck, instead of t he usual cross, a
medallion with Rousseau’s portrait.” 92 The egali - tarianism of the
second Discourse provided a basic theme for the variations of socialist
theory from “Gracchus” Babeuf through Charles Fourier and Karl Marx to
Nikolai Lenin. “For a century now,” said Gustave Lanson, “all the
progress of democracy, equality, universal suffrage,… all the claims of
extreme parties that may be the wave of the future, the war against
wealth and property, all the agitations of the working and suffering
masses, have been in a sense the work of Rousseau.” 93 He had not
appealed to the learned and lofty with logic and argument; he had spoken
to the people at large with feeling and passion in language that they
could understand; and</p>

<li>MARCHE FUNEBRE</li>
</ol>
<p>Diderot, after seeing Voltaire in 1778, asked a friend, “ Why must he
die ?” 94 The funeral march of the philosophes , from the death of
Helvetius in 1771 to that of Morellet in 1819, seemed to be a sardonic
commentary on vanity and pride, but we might also wonder why some of
these men lived so long, inviting all the pains and humiliations of
senility.</p>
<p>The more fortunate among them died before the Revolution, comforted
by a hundred signs that their ideas were approaching victory. Condillac
disappeared in 1780, Turgot in 1781. D’Alembert reluctantly survive d
the death of Mile, de Lespinasse. She had left her papers to his care,
and from them it was evident that during the last twelve years of her
life her love had been given to Mora or Guibert, leaving for himself
only a friendship some- times tinged with irritation. “D’Alembert is
badly hit,” Condorcet told Tur - got; “my whole hope for him now is that
his life may prove bearable.” 95 He returned to his studies, but he
wrote nothing more of importance. He at- tended some of the salons, but
the life had gone out of his once brilliant conversation. He rejected
Frederick’s invitation to Potsdam, and Catherine’s invitation to
St. Petersburg. He wrote to Frederick: “I feel like a man with a long
stretch of desert in front of him and the precipice of death at its end,
and no hope of coming across a single soul who would grieve if he saw
him fall into it, or give himself another thought after he had
disappeared.” 96</p>
<p>He was mistaken; many cared, if only those to whom he regularly sent
p art of his income. Hume, in his will, left ^200 to d’Alembert, 97
confident that it would be spread around. Despite various pensions,
d’Alembert lived simply to the last. In 1783 both he and Diderot were
stricken with serious illnesses — Diderot with ple urisy, d’Alembert
with a disorder of the bladder. Diderot recovered; d’Alembert died
(October 29, 1783), aged sixty -seven.</p>
<p>Diderot had returned from his Russian adventure in October, 1774. The
long trip in a confining carriage had weakened him, but he correctly
pre- dicted that he had “ten years of life left in his sack.” 98 He
worked on a flan of a University for the Government of Russia (which was
not published till 1813); anticipating pedagogical developments by 150
years, he advocated predominant attention to science and technology, and
placed Greek, Latin, and literature almost at the end of the list, with
philosophy between. In 1778 he began an Essai sur les regnes de Claude
et de Neron , et sur la vie et les ecrits de Seneqtie. He digressed to
beg the victorious Americans, in their new commonwealth, to “prevent the
enormous increase and unequal distri - bution of wealth and luxury,
idleness, and the corruption of morals.” 99 And in the section on Seneca
he made place for a hot defense of Grimm, Mme. d’Lpinay, and himself
against the charges that Rousseau had made in public readings of the
Confessions:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 893</p>
<p>If, by a bizarrerie without exception, there should ever appear a
work where honest people are pitilessly torn to pieces by a clever
criminal [un artificieux scelerat ],… look ahead and ask yourselves if
an impudent fellow,… who has confessed a thousand misdeeds, can be…
worthy of belief. What can calumny cost such a man? — what can one crime
more or less add to the secret turpitude of a life hidden during more
than fifty years behind the thickest mask of hypocrisy?… Detest the
ingrate who speaks evil of his benefactors; detest the atrocious man who
does not hesitate to blacken his old friends; detest the coward who
leaves on his tomb the revelation of secrets confided to him…. As for
me, I swear that my eves shall never be sullied by reading his work; I
protest that I would prefer his invectives to his praise. 100</p>
<p>In 1783 Mme. d’£pinay died. Diderot felt this loss deeply, for he had
enjoyed her friendship and her salon. Grimm and d’Holbach were alive,
but his relations with them were tepid; each of the three was sinking
into the narrow egoism of old age; all they could talk of to each other
was their pains. Diderot’s assortment included nephritis, gastritis,
gallstones, and in - flammation of the lungs; he could no longer climb
the stairs from his fourth- floor rooms to his fifth-floor library. He
felt lucky now to have a wife; he had reduced his infidelities to
wistful memories, and she had worn out her vocabulary; they lived in a
peace of mutual exhaustion.</p>
<p>In 1784 he fell seriously ill. Jean de Tersac, the cure of
St.-Sulpice, who had failed with Voltaire, tried to redeem himself with
Diderot, visited him, begged him to return to the Church, and warned him
that unless he received the sacraments he could not enjoy burial in a
cemetery. Diderot answered, “I understand you, Monsieur le Cure. You
refused to bury Voltaire because he did not believe in the divinity of
the Son. Well, when I am dead, they can bury me wherever they like, but
I declare that I believe neither in the Father nor in the Holy Ghost,
nor in any of the Family.” 101</p>
<p>Hearing of his infirmities, the Empress Catherine secured for him and
his wife a splendid suite of rooms in the Rue de Richelieu. They moved
into it about July 18. He smiled as he saw new furniture being carried
in; he could use it, he said, for only a few days. He used it for less
than two weeks. On July 31, 1784, he ate a hearty meal, had an attack of
coronary thrombosis, and died at the table, aged seventy-one. His wife
and his son-in-law per- suaded a local priest to give Diderot a church
burial despite his notorious atheism. The corpse was buried in the
Church of St.-Roch, from which, at some unknown time, it mysteriously
disappeared.</p>
<p>The procession continued. Mably died in 1785, Buff on in 1788,
d’Holbach in 1789. Raynal, as we have seen, outlived the Revolution,
denounced its barbarities, and surprised himself by dying a natural
death (1796). Grimm met all strokes of fortune with Teutonic patience.
In 1775 Joseph II made him a baron of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1776
the Duke of Saxe- Gotha made him minister to France. His Correspovdcmce
litter air e, after 1772, was mostly written by his secretary Jakob
Meister, but Grimm con- tributed trenchant articles on literature, art,
religion, morals, politics, and philosophy. He was the only thorough
skeptic among the philosophes , for</p>
<p>894</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>he doubted philosophy too, and reason, and progress. While Diderot
and others of the faithful looked toward posterity with utopia mirrored
in their eyes, Grimm noted that this was a very ancient mirage, “an
illusion which has been handed down from generation to generation”; and
we have noted his pred iction, in 1757, of an imminent “fatal
revolution.” 102 When the Rev - olution came and became murderous, he
returned to his native Germany and settled in Gotha (1793). Catherine
relieved his poverty and made him her minister at Hamburg (1796). On the
death of his imperial benefactress he went to live with fimilie de
Belsunce, granddaughter of his beloved Mme. d’Lpinay. He survived till
1807, chiefly on memories of those exciting days when the mind of France
was leading Europe to the dizzy brink of freedom.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE LAST PHILOSOPHE</li>
</ol>
<p>Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, descendant of an
ancient family in Dauphine, was bom in Picardy (1743), was educated by
the Jesuits at Reims and Paris, and for many years thought only of
becoming a great mathematician. At the age of twenty-six he was elected
to the Aca- demic des Sciences. Later, as its permanent secretary, he
composed eloges of departed members, as Fontenelle had done for the
French Academy. Vol- taire liked these memorial eulo gies so well that
he told Condorcet: “The public wishes that an Academician might die
every week or so that you might have a chance to write about him.” 103
He visited Voltaire at Ferney (1770), edited an edition of Voltaire’s
works for Beaumarchais, an d wrote for it an ardent Vie de Voltaire.
D’Alembert persuaded him to contribute to the Encyclopedic, and
introduced him to Julie de Lespinasse, at whose receptions he became,
despite his shyness, a principal figure. Indeed, in Julie’s view, he
stood n ext only to d’Alembert in the range of his intellect, and per -
haps above him in the warmth of his benevolence. He was among the first
to join the campaign against slavery (1781). Julie helped to free him
from his hopeless love for Mile. d’Usse, a coque tte who took advantage
of his de- votion but did not return it. He consoled himself with the
friendship of Jean-Baptiste Suard and Mme. Suard, and lived with them in
a contented menage a trois.</p>
<p>In 1785 he published an Essai sur F application de F analyse aux
probabilites. In this he anticipated Malthus’ theory that the growth of
population tends to outrun the production of food; but instead of
advocating sexual absti- nence as a remedy, he proposed birth control.
104</p>
<p>He welcomed the Revolution as opening the door to a future of
universal education, justice, and prosperity. In 1790 he was chosen to
the municipal council that had taken over the administration of Paris.
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly that ruled France from
October 1, 1791, to September 20, 1792. As chairman of the Committee on
Public Instruction he drew up a report advocating and outlining a
national system of primary and sec- ondary education, universal, free,
equal for both sexes, and removed from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 895</p>
<p>ecclesiastical influence. 105 He laid down the principle of the
“welfare state”: “All social institutions should have for their aim the
physical, intellectual, and moral betterment of the most numerous and
poorest class” of the popu - lation. 106 The report was presented to the
Assembly on April 21, 1792; action on it was deferred by the
Revolutionary Wars; but when Napoleon had established his power he made
Condorcet’s report the basis of hi s epochal reorganization of education
in France.</p>
<p>In the National Convention that replaced the Legislative Assembly
Con- dorcet had less prominence, for he was distrusted by the
conservative Gi- rondins as a republican, and by the radical Jacobins as
an aristocrat who was trying to keep the Revolution under middle-class
control. 107 He voted to condemn Louis XVI as guilty of treason, but
voted against his execution. Appointed with eight others to a commission
to formulate a new constitu- tion, he submitted a draft that was
rejected as too favorable to the bour- geoisie. When the Convention,
dominated by the Jacobins, adopted a more radical constitution,
Condorcet wrote an anonymous pamphlet advising the citizens to repudiate
it. On July 8, 1793, the Convention ordered his arrest.</p>
<p>For nine months he hid himself in a pension kept by the widow of the
painter Clau de-Joseph Vernet. There, to distract his mind from fear of
ap- prehension, he wrote the little book that served both as a summary
of the Enlightenment and as a blueprint of the coming utopia. The
manuscript bears the title Prospectus (Tun tableau historique des
progres de /’ esprit hu - main. 10S He called it also Esquisse — a
sketch; apparently he hoped someday to write a fuller exposition of his
philosophy.</p>
<p>He took his inspiration from the lecture in which Turgot, then a
semi- narian (December 11, 1750), had outlined “The Successive Advances
of the</p>
<p>Condorcet, like Voltaire, had no appreciation of the Middle Ages; he
thought of them as the domination of European thought by the Church, the
hypnotism of the people by the magic of the Mass, and the resurrection
of polytheism through the worship of the saints. 111 Though, again like
Voltaire, he retained a deistic belief in God, he relied on the progress
and dissemina- tion of knowledge to undermine the power of the Church,
to extend de- mocracy, and even to improve morals; sin and crime, he
felt, were largely the result of ignorance. 112 “The time will come when
the sun will shine only upon free men who know no other master but their
reason.” 113 He lauded Voltaire for emancipating the mind, and Rousseau
for inspiring men to build a juster social order. He pictured the
cornucopia that would flow in the nine-</p>
<p>8 9 6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>eenth and twentieth centuries from the labors of the eighteenth:
universal education, freedom of thought and expression, liberation of
colonies, equal- ity before the law, and the redistribution of wealth.
He vacillated a bit on universal suffrage: generally he wished to limit
the vote to owners of prop- erty, however little this might be; 114 at
times he feared that the simplicity of the masses would enable a moneyed
minority to indoctrinate them at will, and so create a bourgeois
oligarchy behind a democratic front; 115 but the flight of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette to Varennes, and fear that the powers would seek to
restore autocratic monarchy in France, led him back to the advocacy of
universal suffrage, including women. 116</p>
<p>From his hunted isolation he looked out in imagination upon a future
of glorious fulfillments. He predicted the rise of journalism as a check
on gov- ernmental tyranny; the development of a welfare state through
national insurance and pensions; the stimulation of culture by the
emancipation of women; the lengthening of human life by the progress of
medicine; the spread of federation among states; the transformation of
colonialism into foreign aid by developed to underdeveloped countries;
the lessening of na- tional prejudices by the spread of knowledge; the
application of statistical research to the illumination and formation of
policies; and the increasing association of science with government. 117
Since each age would add new goals to its achievements, there could be
no foreseeable end to progress; not that man will ever become perfect,
but that he will endlessly seek improve- ment. “Nature has set no term
to the perfection of human faculties; the perfectibility of man is
indefinite; and the progress of this perfectibility — henceforth
independent of any power that might wish to halt it — has no other limit
than the duration of the globe upon which nature has cast us.” 118</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Prospectus Condorcet faced the problem that
Malthus was to pose four years later in An Essay on the Principle of
Popu- lation (1798):</p>
<p>Might there not come a moment… when, the number of people in the
world exceeding the means of subsistence, there will in consequence
ensue a continual diminution of happiness,… or at best an oscillation
between good and bad? Will it not show that a point has been reached
beyond which still further improvement is impossible — that the
perfectibility of the human race has, after long years, arrived at a
term beyond which it may never go?… Who will take it upon himself to
predict the condition to which the art of converting the elements to the
use of man may in time be brought?… Even if we agree that the limit will
one day arrive,… consider that, before all this comes to pass, the
progress of reason will have kept pace with that of the sciences, and
that the absurd prejudices of superstition will have ceased to cor- rupt
and degrade the moral code by its harsh doctrines….We can assume that by
then men will know that they have a duty toward those that are not yet
born, a duty not to give them [mere] existence but happiness. 119</p>
<p>Condorcet’s optimism was not quite blind. “We still see the force s
of en- lightenment in possession of no more than a very small portion of
the globe, and the truly enlightened vastly outnumbered by the great
mass of men, who are still given over to ignorance and prejudice. We
still see vast areas in</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV ) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 897</p>
<p>which men groan in slavery.” 120 But “the friend of humanity” must
not lose hope in the face of these difficulties; think of the many noble
things that have already been done, of the immense development of
knowledge and enterprise; what may not a continuance and dissemination
of these accom- plishments produce? And so Condorcet ended his book with
a vision that provided his support in adversity, and served him, and a
million others, in place of a supernatural faith. This is the final and
culminating word of the Enlightenment:</p>
<p>How consoling for the philosopher — who laments the errors, the
crimes, the injustices which still pollute the earth, and of which he is
so often the victim — is this view of the human race, emancipated from
its shackles,… advancing with a firm and sure step along the path of
truth, virtue, and happiness! It is the contemplation of this prospect
that rewards him for all his efforts to assist the progress of reason
and the defense of liberty…. Such contemplation is for him an asylum
into which the memory of his persecutors cannot pursue him. There he
lives in thought with man restored to his natural right and dignity, and
forgets man tormented and corrupted by greed, fear, or envy. There he
lives with his peers in an Elysium created by reason, and graced by the
purest pleasures known to the love of mankind. 121</p>
<p>This profession of faith was almost the cry of a man conscious that
death was seeking him. Fearing that Mme. Vernet might suffer if she were
found sheltering him, Condorcet deposited his manuscript with her, and,
over her protests, left her house in disguise. After wandering on the
outskirts of Paris for several days, he asked for food at an inn. His
appearance, and his lack of identifying papers, aroused suspicion; he
was soon identified as an aris- tocrat, was arrested, and was taken to a
jail in the town of Bourg-la-Reine (April 7, 1794). The next morning he
was found dead in his cell. His first biographer thought that Condorcet
had carried poison in a ring, and had swallowed the poison; but the
report of the medical officer who examined the body ascribed Condorcet’s
death to a clot in a blood vessel. 122 The Con - vention, having secured
and read the Prospectus , ordered three thousand copies of it to be
printed by the state, and to be disseminated throughout France.</p>
<p>V. THE PHILOSOPHERS AND THE REVOLUTION</p>
<p>Burke, de Tocqueville, 123 and Taine 124 agreed that the philosophers
of France, from Bayle to Mably, were a major factor in bringing on the
Rev- olution. Can we accept the conclusions of these brilliant
conservatives?</p>
<p>All the prominent philosophers were opposed to revolution against the
existing governments of Europe; on the contrary, several of them put
their faith in kings as the most practical instruments of reform;
Voltaire, Diderot, and Grimm maintained relations of friendship, if not
of adoration, for one or the other of the most absolute contemporary
rulers — Frederick II, Cath- erine II, Gustavus III; and Rousseau was
happy to receive Joseph II of Aus- tria. Diderot, Helvetius, and
d’Holbach declaimed against kings in general,</p>
<p>898</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>but never, in their extant works, advocated the overthrow of the
French monarchy. 125 Marmontel and Morellet explicitly opposed
revolution; 126 Ma- bly, the socialist, declared himself a royalist; 127
Turgot, idol of the phi - losophes , labored to save, not to destroy,
Louis XVI. Rousseau advanced re- publican ideas, but only for small
states; the Revolution accepted his theories and neglected his warning.
When the revolutionists made France a republic they did so in terms not
of the French philosophers but of Plutarch’s Greek and Roman heroes;
their idol was not Ferney but Sparta and republican Rome.</p>
<p>The philosophers provided the ideological preparation for the
Revolution. The causes were economic or political, the phrases were
philosophical; and the operation of the basic causes was smoothed by the
demolition work of the philosophers in removing such obstacles to change
as belief in feudal privileges, ecclesiastical authority, and the divine
right of kings. Until 1789 all European states had depended upon the aid
of religion in inculcating the sanctity of governments, the wisdom of
tradition, the habits of obedience, and the principles of morality; some
roots of earthly power were planted in heaven, and the state considered
God as the chief of its secret police. Cham- fort, while the Revolution
was in process, wrote that “the priesthood was the first bulwark of
absolute power, and Vol taire overthrew it.” 128 De Tocqueville in 1856
thought that “the universal discredit into which all religious belief
fell at the end of the eighteenth century exercised, without doubt, the
greatest influence upon the whole course of the Revolution.” 12 9
Gradually the skepticism that had riddled the old theology passed to the
scrutiny of secular institutions and affairs. The philosophers denounced
poverty and serfdom as well as intolerance and superstition, and labored
to reduce the power of feudal lords over the peasantry. Some aristocrats
ac- knowledged the force of the satires that attacked them, and many
lost con- fidence in their inborn superiority and traditional rights.
Hear Comte Louis- Philippe de Segur:</p>
<p>We were scornful critics of the old customs, of the feudal pride of
our fathers and their severe etiquette…. We felt disposed to follow with
en- thusiasm the philosophical doctrines professed by witty and bold
writers. Vol- taire attracted our intellect, and Rousseau touched our
hearts. We took secret pleasure in seeing them assail the old
framework…. We enjoyed at the same time the advantages of the patriciate
and the amenities of a plebeian philosophy. 130</p>
<p>These conscience-stricken nobles included such influential persons as
Mira- beau pere and fils. La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, Lafayette, Vicomte
Louis- Marie de Noailles, and “Philippe Egalite,” Due d’Orleans; and
recall the aid</p>
<p>1789). Even the royal family was touched by the semirepublican ideas
that the philosophers had helped to spread. The father of Louis XVI
memorized</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) DEATH AND THE PHILOSOPHERS 899</p>
<p>many passages from Montesquieu’s Spirit of Laws, read Rousseau’s
Social Contract, and judged it “largely sound” except for its criticism
of Christian - ity. He taught his sons (three of whom became kings) that
“the distinctions which you enjoy were not given you by nature, which
has created all men equal.” 131 Louis XVI, in his edicts, acknowledged
“natural law” and “the rights of man” 132 as following from man’s nature
as a rational being.</p>
<p>The American Revolution gave added prestige to republican ideas. That
Revolution, too, took its force from economic realities like taxation
and trade, and its Declaration of Independence owed as much to English
think- ers as to French; but it was noted that Washington, Franklin, and
Jefferson had been molded to free thought by the philosophes. Through
those Ameri- can sons of the French Enlightenment, republican theories
graduated into a government victorious in arms, recognized by a French
King, and proceed- ing to establish a constitution indebted in some
measure to Montesquieu.</p>
<p>The French Revolution had three phases. In the first the nobles,
through the parlements, tried to recapture from the monarchy that
dominance which they had lost to Louis XIV; those nobles were not
inspired by the philos- ophers. In the second stage the middle classes
won control of the Revolu- tion; they had been deeply permeated by the
notions of the philosophers, but what they meant by “equality” was the
equality of the bourgeois with the aristocrat. In the third stage the
directors of the city populace seized the mastery. The masses remained
pious, but their leaders had lost respect for priests and kings; the
masses loved Louis XVI to the end, but the leaders cut off his head.
After October 6, 1789, the Jacobins controlled Paris, and Rous- seau was
their god. On November 10, 1793, the triumphant radicals cele- brated in
the Cathedral of Notre-Dame the Feast of Reason. At Tours the
revolutionaries replaced the statues of saints with new figures called
Mably, Rousseau, and Voltaire. At Chartres in 1795, in the famous
cathedral, a Feast of Reason was opened by a drama in which Voltaire and
Rousseau were shown united in a campaign against fanaticism. 133</p>
<p>Therefore we cannot doubt that the philosophers profoundly affected
the ideology and the political drama of the Revolution. They had not in-
tended to produce violence, massacre, and the guillotine; they would
have shrunk in horror from those bloody scenes. They could properly say
that they had been cruelly misunderstood; but they were responsible
insofar as they had underestimated the influence of religion and
tradition in restraining the animal instincts of men. Meanwhile, under
those striking pronounce- ments and visible events, the real revolution
was proceeding, as the middle classes, using philosophy as one among a
hundred instruments, took from the aristocracy and the king the control
of the economy and the state.</p>
