<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>Richelieu</p>
<p>1585-1642</p>
<p>I. BETWEEN TWO KINGS: 161O-24</p>
<p>T he sudden death of Henry IV left France in a renewed disorder,</p>
<p>many-rooted in the struggle of the nobles against the monarchy,
of</p>
<p>the middle classes against the aristocracy, of the Catholics against
the Huguenots, of the clergy against the state, of the young King Louis
XIII against his mother, and of France against Austria and Spain. The
fascinat- ing and demonic genius who resolved all this chaos into order,
defeated the feudal reaction, pacified the Huguenots, subordinated the
Church to the state, saved Protestant Germany from collapse, broke the
power of the encompassing Hapsburgs, and raised the French monarchy to
domestic omnipotence and European supremacy was a Catholic priest, the
greatest, subtlest, and most ruthless statesman in the history of
France.</p>
<p>It was part of Henry’s tragedy that at his death his heir, Louis
XIII, was a helpless boy of eight, and that the widow to whom he had
left the re- gency was a woman of more courage than intelligence,
willing to sur- render the government to Italian favorites provided she
might enjoy the sweets of life in swelling amplitude. She abandoned
Henry’s plan of a war to the death against the Hapsburgs; on the
contrary, she allied France with Spain by marrying her children to those
of Philip III — her son Louis to Anne of Austria, her daughter Elizabeth
to the future Philip IV. The will of Richelieu was to prove stronger
than this mingled blood.</p>
<p>Henry and Sully had left 41,345,000 livres in the treasury. Concino
Con- cini, his wife Leonora Galigai, the Duke of Epernon, and other
thirsty courtiers gathered around this hoard and prepared to consume it.
Sully protested but was overruled; he resigned in disgust, retired to
his estates, and wrote memoirs of his beloved King.</p>
<p>The nobles saw in the corrupt incompetence of the central government
a chance to restore their old feudal sovereignties. They demanded and
obtained a convocation of the States-General, assuming that it would be,
as usually in the past, their voice and weapon against the monarchy. But
when it met, at Paris in October 1614, they were disconcerted by the
strength and the proposals of the Third Estate — the untitled,
untonsured mass of the people, represented then, as now, by lawyers, and
expressing</p>
<p>374</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>the power and the wishes of the middle class. Nobles and clergy,
rating birth and ointment above wealth and law, challenged the new
heritability of judicial offices, which was creating a rival nobility of
the robe. The tiers etat retaliated by asking for an investigation of
the spacious gifts and pensions recently received by nobles from the
government; it called for the correction of abuses in the Church; it
objected to the application, in France, of the rigorous decrees of the
Council of Trent; it demanded that the clergy be subject to the same
laws and courts as the laity, that a check be put upon the further
acquisition of realty by the untaxable Church, and that the clergy
baptize, marry, and bury the people without charge; finally, it defended
the absolute authority and divine right of the king over the claims of
nobles to rule him and of the popes to depose him. This was an
unexpected revolution. The troublesome delegates were placated with
promises, and the assembly was dissolved (March 1615). The promises were
for the most part forgotten, peculation and mismanagement were re-
sumed, and no further States-General was called until monarchy,
nobility, and clergy alike collapsed in 1789.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the French Catholic clergy now honored itself with sin-
cere and effective self-reform. It was not always responsible for the
abuses that disordered the Church, since many of these stemmed from the
ap- pointment of bishops and abbots by kings or nobles half pagan in
life and sometimes skeptical in creed.’ Henry IV gave Huguenot Sully
four monas- teries for his private support, and made his mistress
“Corisande” abbess of Chatillon-sur-Seine. Noble lords bestowed
episcopacies, abbacies, and nunneries upon their younger sons, their
illegitimate children, their brave soldiers, their favorite women. As
the reform decrees of the Council of Trent were not yet accepted in
France, there were few seminaries for the training of priests; any
tonsured youth who could read the Latin missal and acquire the elements
of liturgy was eligible for the sacerdotal office; and many bishops, who
had been easy-living men of the world before being rewarded with sees,
appointed to pastorates men of little education and less holiness. “The
name of priest,” said a priest, “has become the synonym for ignorance
and deba uchery.”® “The worst enemies of the Church,” said St. Vincent
de Paul, “are her unworthy priests.”®</p>
<p>Pere Bourdoise attacked the moral side of the problem by establishing
(i6io) the Communaute des Pretres, which required all the priests of a
parish to live together in simplicity and fidelity to their vows. In
1611 Pere de Berulle founded the Congregation of the Oratory, on the
model of a similar foundation by St. Philip Neri in Italy; it became a
seminary for training young priests to better education and dedication.
In 1641 Fere Jean Jacques Olier organized the Sulpiciau order to prepare
men for the priesthood, and in 1646 he opened the seminary and church of
St.-Sulpice</p>
<p>376</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>in Paris. In 1643 Pere Jean (St. John) Eudes formed the Congregation
of Jesus and Mary to fit men for the priesthood and missions. So were
formed Bossuet, Bourdaloue, and Malebranche of the next generations, and
the power and splendor of the Church under Louis XIV.</p>
<p>New religious orders revealed and revived the piety of the people.
The Ursuline nuns entered France toward 1600 and undertook the education
of girls; within a century they had 1,000 houses and 350 congregations.
The Order of the Brothers of Mercy, founded (1540) in Spain by Juan de
Dios (St. John of God), was welcomed into France by Marie de</p>
<p>Medicis and soon provided thirty hospitals. In 1610 Jeanne Fremiot,
Baron- ess of Chantal (St. Chantal), helped by Frangois de Sales
(St. Francis of Sales), established the Congregation of the Visitation
of Our Lady for the care of the sick and the poor; by 1640 it had a
hundred convents; by 1700 one branch alone had four hundred nunneries.
All in all there were in France in 1600 some eighty thousand nuns.*</p>
<p>Two men stand out with special prominence in this Catholic revival of
the seventeenth century. Frangois de Sales took part of his name from
the town of his birth, near Annecy, in Savoy. He studied law at Padua
and became an official of the Savoy Senate. But religion was in his
blood; he was ordained a priest, and undertook (1594) the difficult task
of winning back to Catholicism the Chablais region, south of Lake
Geneva, which had been Calvinist since 1535. In five years the mission
was accomplished, partly by exiling the unconverted, but mostly by
Frangois’ persuasive piety, patience, and tact. Raised to a bishopric,
he gave himself to teaching chil- dren and adults. When he visited Paris
highborn women fell reverently in love with him, and for a time piety
became fashionable.</p>
<p>The career of Vincent de Paul followed less traditional grooves. He
be- gan as a swineherd, but somehow he found his way to a Franciscan
college in Gascony. His father, longing, like every Catholic parent, to
get his</p>
<p>family into Paradise by dedicating a child to the Church, sold a yoke
of oxen to send his boy to study theology at the University of Toulouse.
There Vincent was ordained priest (1600). On a voyage in the Mediter-
ranean he was captured by pirates, and he was sold as a slave in Tunis.
He escaped, went to Paris, served King Henry’s divorced Margot as
chaplain, and then became spiritual director to Mme. de Gondi. With
funds pro- vided by this lady he organized missions among the peasantry;
after nearly every mission he established a conference de charite for
the relief of the local poor; and to provide for the continuance of
these foundations he organized the Congregation of the Priests of the
Mission — often called the Lazarists from the Priory of St. Lazarus that
served as their headquar- ters in Paris. As M. de Gondi was commandant
of the French galleys, Vincent took to preaching to the galley convicts.
Shocked by their hard-</p>

<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>ships and diseases, he opened hospitals for them at Paris and
Marseille, and aroused the conscience of France to better treatment of
the prisoners. He persuaded well-to-do women to give periodic service in
the hospitals; he raised large sums for charitable distribution; and to
administer these, and help his “Ladies of Charity,” he organized (1633)
the Sisters (whom he preferred to call the Daughters) of Charity — now
serving humanity and their’ Church in many quarters of the world.</p>
<p>Physically unattractive, poorly garbed, resembling some wrinkled,</p>
<p>bearded rabbi, “Monsieur Vincent,” by his labors for the poor, the
sick, the criminal, won the hearts of nearly all who knew him. He
collected great sums, established hospitals, asylums, seminaries, homes
for the aged, retreats for laymen and priests; volumes have swollen with
accounts of his benefactions. During the Fronde of 1648-53 and the
blockade of Paris he supervised the feeding of fifteen thousand
destitute persons; here, however, dogma overcame charity, and he
required a confession of Catholic faith as a condition of receiving
food.® He joined in the campaign against Port- Royal, but tried to
soften the persecution of its nuns.® When he died, half of Paris mourned
him; and satisfaction was universal when the Church (1737) enrolled him
among her saints.</p>
<p>Through him, and Frangois de Sales, and the undiscourageable Jesuits,
and the ardent service of innumerable women, French Catholicism experi-
enced under Louis XIII a rebirth of vigor and devotion. Old monastic
orders returned to their rules; nunneries reformed themselves; now began
Port-Royal and its Jansenist saints. Mysticism found new advocates and
practitioners of absorption in direct contemplation of God. The young
King, caught in the fervor of the age, solemnly placed France under the
protection of the Virgin Mary, “in order,” said the royal edict, “that
all his loyal subjects might be received into Paradise . . . such being
his good will and pleasure.”^ Watchmen continued, as in medieval France,
to awaken</p>
<p>Reveillez vous, gens qui dormez,</p>
<p>Priez Dieu pour les trepasses?</p>
<p>But the conflict of creeds continued bitterly. Marie de Medicis
adhered faithfully, despite her piety, to the Edict of Nantes, but
neither Catholics nor Huguenots were disposed to tolerance. The Pope,
his nuncio, and the Catholic clergy denounced the government for
permitting heresy. Where Catholics dominated they disrupted Protestant
services, destroyed Protes- tant churches, homes, sometimes lives;®
children were forcibly taken from Huguenot parents on the ground that
the parents prevented them from fulfilling their desire to become
Catholics.^® Where Protestants dominated</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>they retaliated in kind. They excluded the Mass from some 250 towns
under their rule;^^ they demanded that the government prohibit Catholic
pro- cessions in Protestant territory; they ridiculed, disturbed,
sometimes at- tacked such processions; they forbade Protestants to
attend Catholic bap- tisms, marriages, or funerals; and their ministers
declared that they would withhold the Sacrament from parents whose
children married Catholics.^^ Said a famous freethinker, “While the
Catholics were theoretically more bigoted than the Protestants, the
Protestants became more bigoted than the Catholics.”^® The preachers
rivaled the Catholic clergy in suppressing heresy and criticism; they
excommunicated and “delivered up to Satan” (but did not bum) Jeremie
Perrier for having made fun of ecclesiastical assemblies; and their
writings attacked Catholicism in “works which, for bitterness of
feeling, have hardly ever been equaled, and which it would certainly be
impossible to surpass.”^^ Fearing repeal of the Edict of Nantes, and
resenting the alliance of France with Spain, the Huguenots strove to
make their part of France politically independent and militarily secure,
with its own army and its own laws.</p>
<p>When Louis XIII visited Pau (1620) he was shocked to find not one</p>
<p>Catholic church in which to perform his devotions.^® The young King
looked with alarmed resentment upon a faith that threatened to divide
not merely the soul but also the body of France. He searched anxiously,
amid his court, for a man with enough iron in his blood to transform
this sunder- ing chaos of creeds and powers into a strong and united
nation.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">

</ol>
<p>He knew that he himself lacked the physical health and mental force
needed to meet these challenges. Begotten in the forty-eighth year of a
father perhaps weakened by sexual exuberance, he suffered from tuber-
culosis, intestinal inflammation, and an embarrassing impediment in his
speech. Through long periods he was too weak to indulge in sports; he
played and composed music, grew peas for the market, put up preserves,
and helped in the kitchen. Heredity and disease left him no charms of
figure or face; he was precariously thin, his head and nose were
oversized, his pendulous underlip left his mouth always partly open; and
his long, livid countenance harmonized with his deliberately drab
costume. He suffered no more from nature than from his physicians, who
in a single year bled him forty-seven times, gave him 2 1 5 enemas, and
poured 2 1 2 drugs down his throat.^® He survived by engaging in sports
when he could, hunting, join- ing his army, sleeping in the open air,
and eating the soldiers’ simple food.</p>
<p>Beaten repeatedly by his teachers, he abominated education, and
seems</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>never to have read a book except for prayer. He read the canonical
hours every day, accepted without question the faith taught him in his
growing years, and always joined and accompanied to its end any
procession that bore the consecrated Host. A neurotic tendency to
occasional cruelty tarnished a disposition basically kind. He was shy,
secretive, and morose, not much loving a life that had not loved him.
His mother considered him feeble-minded, neglected him, and openly
preferred his younger brother, Gaston; he responded by hating her and
worshiping the memory of his father. He developed an aversion to women,
and after some timid con- templation of Mile, de Hautefort’s beauty he
gave his affections to young men. Married politically to Anne of
Austria, he had to be prodded into her bed. When she miscarried he left
her intact for thirteen years. The court advised him to take a mistress,
but he had other tastes. Then at thirty- seven, yielding to the demands
of all France for a dauphin, he tried again, and grateful Anne gave the
world Louis XIV (1638). Two years later she bore Philippe I of Orleans,
who continued his father’s appreciation of male charms.</p>
<p>Louis was some inches a king. Suddenly, still a lad of sixteen, tired
of Concini’s impuden ce and peculations, he gave secret orders for his
assassina- tion (1617); and when the Queen Mother protested against this
termina- tion of her favorite, he banished her to Blois and chose as his
chief minister Charles d’ Albert, who had suggested the stroke, and who
was now made Duke of Luynes. Pressed by the Duke and Pope Paul V, Louis
ordered the Huguenots to restore all property that they had appropriated
from the Church. When Beam ignored the decree, he marched into the
province, compelled obedience, and brought Bearn and Navarre — once his
father’s personal realm — under the direct rule of the king. The
Huguenots made no immediate resistance; but in 1620 their General
Assembly, meeting in their strongest city. La Rochelle, demanded the
return of the restored property, as belonging to the people rather than
to the Church; moreover, it apportioned France into eight “circles,” and
appointed for each of them</p>

<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE CARDINAL AND THE HUGUENOTS</li>
</ol>
<p>How does a man make his way to the top? In those days it helped to be
wellborn. Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu had for mother the
daughter of an advocate in the Parlement of Paris, and for his father
the Seigneur de Richelieu, Grand Provost of the Royal Household under
Henry IV. The ancient Poitou family inherited the right to recommend to
the king a can- didate for the bishopric of Lugon. Armand, twenty-one,
was so nominated by Henry (1606). Two years too young for episcopacy, he
hastened to Rome, lied about his age, and delivered before Paul V so
handsome a Latin harangue that the Pope surrendered the see. This fait
being accompli, Rich- elieu confessed his lie and asked for absolution.
The Pope complied, re- marking, ^’’Questo giovane sard un gran furbo”
(This youth will be a great</p>
<p>The young bishop described his bishopric as the “poorest and
nastiest” see in France, but there was some money in the family, and he
soon had his coach and his silver plate. He did not take his office as a
lazy sinecure; he devoted himself assiduously to his duties, but he
found time to flatter every influence and pull every wire. When the
clergy of Poitou chose a delegate to the States-General (1614), Armand
was their man. In that as- sembly his grave face, his tall, slim figure,
his almost legal ability to grasp an issue clearly and present it
persuasively, impressed everyone, especially Marie de Medicis. Through
her and Concini he was made a secretary of state (1616). A year later
Concini was killed and Richelieu lost his post. After a brief service
with the banished Queen Mother at Blois he returned to Lugon. Marie
plotted to escape; Richelieu was suspected of complicity; he was exiled
to Avignon (1618); his political career seemed finished. But even his
enemies recognized his abilities; and when Marie let herself out by
night from a window of her castle at Blois and joined a force of rebel
aristocrats, Luynes recalled the young bishop and commissioned him to
win the Queen Mother back to reason and the King. He succeeded;</p>
<p>Louis secured a cardinal’s hat for him and appointed him to the
Council of State. Soon Richelieu’s superiority of mind and will made
itself evident, and in August 1624, aged thirty-nine, he became prime
minister.</p>
<p>The King found in him precisely the objective intelligence, the
clear</p>
<p>purpose, the tenacity of ends, and the flexibility of means wherein
he himself was wanting; and he had the wisdom to accept the Cardinal’s
guidance in the triple task of subduing the Huguenots, the nobles, and
Spain. In h is memoirs Richelieu remarked appreciatively, “The ability
to let himself be served 〔to delegate authority〕 is not among the
least quali- ties of a great king.”^® Louis did not always agree with
his minister; some -</p>
<p>CHAP. XV )</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>times he rebuked him; always he was jealous of him; now and then he
thought of dismissing him. But how could he reject a man who was making
him absolute in France and supreme in Europe, and who was bringing in
more taxes than even Sully had gleaned?</p>
<p>The spirit of the Cardinal showed itself first in his treatment of
religion. He accepted without discussion the doctrines of the Church,
and added a few superstitions surprising in so powerful a mind. But he
ignored the claim of the “Ultramontanist” part y that the popes had full
dominion over kings; he preserved the “Gallican liberties” of the French
Church as against Rome; and in things temporal he subordinated the
Church to the state as resolutely as any Englishman. He banished Father
Caussin, who, as the royal con- fessor, had intervened in politics; no
religion, in his view, should mingle with affairs of state. The
alliances he formed for France were made with Protestant and Catholic
powers indifferently.</p>
<p>He applied his principles firmly to Huguenots playing politics.
Despite the peace of 1622, they had made La Rochelle a virtually
sovereign city, under the control of its merchants, ministers, and
generals. From that stra- tegic port the merchants plied their trade
with the world, and pirates sailed out to seize any booty or any ship,
even those of France; through this port, given Huguenot permission, any
enemy of France might enter. Louis too had violated the treaty; he had
promised to demolish Fort Louis, which was a standing threat to the
city; instead he strengthened it, and assembled a small fleet in the
nearby harbor of Le Blavet. Benjamin (brother to Henri) de Rohan,
Seigneur de Soubise, commanding a Huguenot squad- ron, captured this
royal fleet and towed it in triumph to La Rochelle (1625). Richelieu
built another fleet, organized an army, and accompanied the King to the
siege of the Huguenot stronghold.</p>
<p>Soubise persuaded the Duke of Buckingham to send an armada of 120
vessels to protect the city. It came, but suffered so sorely from the
artillery of the royal forts on the island of Re that it crept back to
England in dis- grace (1627). Meanwhile Richelieu, acting as general for
his sick King, had captured all the land approaches to La Rochelle; it
remained only to blockade it by sea. He ordered his engineers and his
soldiers to build a mole of masonry, 1,700 yards long, across the
entrance to the harbor, leaving an opening for the movement of the
tides. These were so strong,</p>
<p>rising and falling twelve feet, that the enterprise seemed
impractica- ble; every day half the stones laid that day were washed
away. The</p>
<p>King grew weary of this bloodless warfare and went off to Paris; many
courtiers expected him to dismiss Richelieu for failing to take the city
by assault. But at last the mole was complete and began its scheduled
work. Half the population of La Rochelle died of hunger. Only the

<p>COW. Jean Guiton, the mayor, threatened to kill with his own dagger
any- one who spoke of yielding. Nevertheless, after thirteen months of
famine and disease, the city capitulated in despair (October 30, 1628).
Richelieu entered on horseback, followed by soldiers mercifully
distributing bread.</p>
<p>Half of France clamored for the total extinction of the Huguenots.
Ex- hausted, they could only pray. Richelieu surprised them with peace
terms that seemed to the Catholics outrageously lenient. La Rochelle
lost its municipal independence, its forts, and its walls, but the
persons and prop- erty of the inhabitants were spared, the surviving
Huguenot troops were allowed to depart with their arms, and the free
exercise of both the Prot- estant and the Catholic worship in the city
was guaranteed. Other Hugue- not towns, surrendering, received similar
terms. Catholic property expro- priated by Protestants had to be
restored, but the temporarily homeless Huguenot ministers were
compensated by a state subsidy of 200,000 livres, and, like the Catholic
clergy, they were exempted from the head tax, or taille}^ A general
amnesty was granted to all who had shared in the re- bellion. Henry IV’s
Edict of Nantes was confirmed in every essential by Richelieu’s Edict of
Grace (June 28, 1629). Positions in the army, navy, and civil service
were kept open to all without question of creed. Europe was startled to
see French Catholics following and honoring Protestant generals like
Turenne, Schomberg, and Henri de Rohan. “From that time,” said
Richelieu, “differences in religion never prevented me from rendering to
the Huguenots all sorts of good offices.”*® With a wisdom tragically
lacking in Louis XIV, the great Cardinal recognized — as Colbert was to
do — the immense economic value of the Huguenots to France. They
abandoned revolt, gave themselves peacefully to commerce and industry,
and prospered as never before.</p>

<li>THE cardinal AND THE NOBLES</li>
</ol>
<p>He proceeded with equal resolution, and less lenience, against the
nobles who still held France to be many and not one. Feudalism was by no
means dead. It had fought in the religious wars for control of the
central govern- ment. The great nobles still had their fortified
castles, their armed forces, their private wars, their private courts,
their officers of law; they still had the peasantry at their mercy, and
charged obstructive tolls on commerce traversing their domains. France,
dismembered by feudalism and religion, was not yet a nation; it was an
unstable and agitated assemblage of proud and semi-independent barons
capable at any moment of disrupting the peace and the economy of the
state. Most of the provinces were ruled by dukes or counts who claimed
their governorships for life and handed them on to their sons.</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>383</p>
<p>It seemed to Richelieu that the only practicable alternative to this
en- feebling chaos was to centralize authority and power in the king.
Conceiv- ably he might have labored to balance this by restoring some
measure of municipal autonomy. But he could not restore the medieval
commune, which had rested on the guilds and a protected local economy;
the passage from a city to a national market had undermined the guilds
and the com- munes, and requu’ed central rather than local legislation.*
To minds frozen in the perspective of today, the royal absolutism
desired by Richelieu seems but a reactionary despotism; in the view of
history, and of the great majority of Frenchmen in the seventeenth
century, it was a liberating prog- ress from feudal tyranny to unified
rule. France was not ripe for democ- racy; most of its population were
ill-fed, ill-clothed, illiterate, darkened with superstitions and
murderous with certainties. The towns were con- trolled by businessmen
who could think in no other terms than their own profit or loss; and
these men, hampered at every step by feudal privileges, were not
disposed to unite with the lesser nobles, as in England, to establish a
parliament checking the royal power. The French parlements were not
representative and legislative parliaments; they were superior courts,
nur- tured and mortised in precedent; they were not chosen by the
people, and they became citadels of conservatism. The middle classes,
the artisans, and the peasants approved the absolutism of the king as
the only protection they could see from the absolutism of the lords.</p>
<p>In 1626, in the name of the King, Richelieu issued an edict that
struck at the very base of feudalism: he ordered the destruction of all
fortresses except on the frontiers, and forbade, in future, the
fortification of private dwellings. In the same year (his older brother
having been killed in a duel) he made dueling a capital crime; and when
Montmorency-Bouteville and the Count des Chapelles dueled nevertheless,
he had them put to death. He confessed himself “much troubled in spirit”
by this procedure, but he told his master, “It is a question of breaking
the neck of duels or of your Maj - esty’s edicts.”^^ The nobles vowed
vengeance and plotted the minister’s fall.</p>
<p>They found an eager ally in the Queen Mother. Once the patron of</p>
<p>Richelieu, she came to hate him when she saw him opposing her
policies. When Louis fell gravely ill (July 1630), she and the Queen
nursed him back to semihealth and asked, as their reward, the Cardinal’s
head. In her own palace, the Luxembourg, Marie de Medicis, thinking
Richelieu far away, repeated the demand with passionate urgency, and
offered, as a will- ing replacement, Michel de Marillac, Keeper of the
Seals. Richelieu, com- ing by a secret passage, entered the room
unannounced and confronted the Queen Mother; she confessed that she had
told the King that either she</p>

in the twentieth</p>
<p>384</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>or he, Richelieu, must go. The harassed King withdrew and rode off to
his hunting lodge at Versailles. Courtiers flocked around Marie,
rejoicing in her expected victory. But Louis sent for Richelieu,
confirmed him as prime minister, assured him of the royal support, and
signed an order for Marillac’s arrest. The plotting nobles were thrown
into angry con - fusion by that “Day of Dupes” (November 10, 1630).
Marillac was al - lowed to live, but his younger brother, a marshal of
France, was later indicted on a charge of peculation and was rather
summarily put to death (1632). Louis ordered his mother to retire to her
chateau at Moulins and to withdraw from politics. Instead, she fled to
Flanders (1631), formed a court in exile at Brussels, and continued to
work for Richelieu’s fall. She never saw the King again.</p>
<p>Her other son, “Monsieur,” Gaston, Duke of Orleans, raised an army in
Lorraine and led it in open rebellion against his brother (1632). He was
joined by several nobles, among them the highest in France — Henri, Duke
of Montmorency, governor of Languedoc. Thousands of the aristocracy
rallied to the revolt. Near Castelnaudary (September i ) the
thirty-seven- year-old Montmorency engaged the forces sent against him
by Richelieu. He fought ti ll brought down by seventeen wounds; his and
Gaston’s army, rich in titles but poor in discipline, fell to pieces
under attack, and Mont- morency was captured. Gaston surrendered and, as
the price of pardon, named his accomplices. Louis ordered the Parlement
of Toulouse to try Montmorency for treason; its verdict was death. The
last of the ducal Montmorencys died without fear or complaint, saying,
“I hold this de - cree of the King’s justice for a decree of (jod’s
mercy.”*^ Most of France</p>
<p>Two further obstacles remained to Richelieu’s supremacy: the
governors and the parlements. Resenting the loss of provincial revenue
through mal- versation and incompetence in noble governors and in
bourgeois or petty- noble magistrates, the Cardinal sent to each
district “intendants” to supervise the administration of finance and
justice and the enforcement of the laws. These royal appointees took
precedence over local oflicials of whatever rank; local autonomy
declined, efficiency and tax collections rose. Antici- pated in some
measure by Henry IV, suppressed by the nobles in the Fronde,
consolidated by Louis XIV, adapted by Napoleon, this system of
intendants became a major feature of the centrally controlled bureau-
cracy that henceforth administered the laws of France,</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>The Parlement of Paris thought it opportune, under a weak monarchy,
to extend its functions from the registration and interpretation of the
laws to the role of an advisory council to the king. Richelieu would not
brook such rivalry to his Council of State; probably under his prodding,
and with his sharp phrasing, Louis summoned the leaders of the Parlement
and told them, “You are constituted only to judge between Master Peter
and Master John; if you go on as at present I will pare your nails so
close that you will be sorry.”^^ The Paris Parlement yielded, and the
prov incial parlements followed suit. Even their traditional functions
were curtailed; Richelieu set up “extraordinary commissions” to try
special cases. France</p>
<p>V. THE CARDINAL SUPREME</p>
<p>With this concentrated power in his hands, he did everything for</p>
<p>France, little for the people. He thought of France as a power, not
as a sum of living individuals; he did not idealize the common man, and
he probably thought it dulce et decorum that such men should die for
their country; he would sacrifice them to make the future France secure
from Hapsburg encirclement. He labored far into the night at the
business of the state, but almost always on foreign policy. He had no
time to improve the economy, except to ferret out tax evaders and bring
revenue and “intelligence” to Paris with less leakage on the way. In
1627 he organized a public post.</p>
<p>Taxes were still collected by financiers to whom they had been
“farmed”; these men had exacted twice, sometimes thrice, the amount they
trans- mitted to the government. The nobility and the clergy were exempt
from the major taxes; clever businessmen and the hoards of officials
found ways of avoiding or appeasing the collectors; towns paid a small
composition to escape the poll tax; the brunt of the burden fell upon
the peasantry; Rich- elieu bled it to destitution to make France the
strongest power in Christen- dom. Like Henry IV, he preferred to conquer
enemies with money rather than with blood; many of the treaties with
which he waged war included subsidies to allies and douceurs to
potential foes. At times, desperate for funds, he advanced his own money
to the treasury; once he hired an al- chemist to make gold.^® Taxation
and the state corvee — unpaid labor on the roads — co-operated with
drought, famine, pestilence, and ravages by soldiery to bring peasants
near to suicide; several killed their families and themselves; starving
mothers killed and ate their infants (1639).®® In 1634,</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>according to a probably exaggerated report, a fourth of the
population of Paris begged.^^ Periodically and sporadically the poor
rose in revolts that were mercilessly suppressed.</p>
<p>Richelieu used the taxes to build armies and a navy; right would not
be heard unless it spoke with guns. Having purchased the office of grand
admiral, he fulfilled its functions resolutely. He repaired and
fortified harbors, established arsenals and provision depots at the
ports, built eighty- five ships, founded pilot schools, trained marine
regiments. He raised a hundred regiments of infantry, three hundred
troops of cavalry; he re- stored discipline in the army; he failed only
in his efforts to banish its prostitutes. With his revitalized armament
he faced the chaos of foreign relations bequeathed by the regency of
Marie de Medicis, returned to the policy of Henry IV, and directed all
his forces to one goal — the liberation of France from the cordon of
Hapsburg power in the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Marie had allied France to Spain — i.e., in Richelieu’s view, she had
sub - mitted to the enemy; and she had alienated those on whom Henry IV
had relied as friends — the English, the Dutch, and the Protestants of
Germany. With the quick strategic eye of a general, Richelieu saw in the
Valtelline passes that connected Austria and Spanish Italy the key to
the united power of Spain and the Empire to exchange supplies and
troops. For twelve years he struggled to win those passes; his wars
against the Huguenots and the nobles distracted and defeated him; but he
retrieved with diplomacy far more than he had lost in war. He had won to
his faithful service Fran9ois Le Clerc du Tremblay, who had taken the
name Joseph on becoming a Capuchin monk; “Father Joseph” was sent
everywhere on delicate diplo - matic missions, and performed them
skillfully; and France began to pair the gray-garbed monk as Eminence
Grise — his Gray Eminence — ^with the red-robed Richelieu as Eminence
Rouge. So aided, the Cardinal vowed that he would “prove to the world
that the age of Spain is passing, and the age of France has come.”^®</p>
<p>In 1629 the epochal conflict in Germany seemed about to end in the
complete triumph of the Catholic Hapsburg Emperor over the Protestant
princes. Richelieu turned the tables with money. He signed with Gustavus
Adolphus (1631) a treaty by which the virile King of Sweden, aided by a
million livres a year from France, was to invade Germany and rescue the
Protestant states. The ultramontanists of France denounced the minister
as a traitor to the faith; he retorted that neutrality was treason to
France. When Gustavus died in victory at Liitzen (1632) and most German
princes yielded to the Emperor, Richelieu actively entered the war. He
expanded the French armies from 12,000 in 1621 to 150,000 in 1638; he
helped the revolt of the Catalans in Spain; his diplomacy gave him
control of Trier,</p>
<p>CHAP, XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>Coblenz, Colmar, Mannheim, and Basel; his troops took Lorraine and
forced their way through Savoy to Milan, the center of Spanish power in
North Italy.</p>
<p>Then the pendulum of fortune veered, and all these victories seemed
meaningless. In July and August, 1636, a strong force of Spanish and
Imperial troops crossed the Netherlands into France, took
Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) and Corbie, advanced to Amiens, laid waste the
green valleys of the Somme and the Oise. Richelieu’s armies were far
away; the road t o Paris lay open and defenseless to the enemy. The
Queen Mother in Brussels, the Queen in St.-Germain, and her pro-Spanish
party in France rejoiced, and counted the days before the Cardinal’s
expected fall. In Paris angry multitudes pullulated in the streets,
calling for his death. But when he ap- peared among them, outwardly calm
on his stately horse, no one dared touch him, and many prayed God to
give him strength to save France. Then appeared not only his courage,
but his foresight and industry: he had long ago organized the citizens
of Paris into a reserve militia; he had stored up arms and materials for
them; now he inspired them with fervor, and they responded to his call;
the Parlement of Paris, the corporations, and the guilds voted funds; in
a few days a new army was on the march, and it laid siege to Corbie.
Gaston of Orleans, in command, dillydallied; Rich- elieu came up, took
charge, ordered assault. On November 14 Corbie was taken, and the
Hapsburg troops retreated into the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In 1638 Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, leading a German army financed by
Richelieu, took Elsass; dying a year later, he bequeathed it to France;
Elsass and Lothringen became Alsace-Lorraine and began to be French. In
1640 Arras was taken. In 1642 a force under the command of the King and
the Cardinal captured Perpignan, and the surrounding province of
Roussillon was detached from Spain. Everywhere Richelieu seemed now the
organizer of victory.</p>
<p>The unreconciled nobles, the Spanish faction at the court, the
highborn ladies palpitating with intrigue, made a last effort to unseat
the minister.</p>
<p>In 1632, after long serving the Cardinal in diplomacy and war, the
Marquis of Effiat died, leaving a widow and a handsome twelve-year-old
son, Henri Coiffier de Ruze, Marquis of Cinq-Mars. Richelieu took the
lad under his , protection and introduced him to the King; perhaps he
thought with this toy to distract Louis from Mile, de Hautefort, who was
among the in- triguantes. It so transpired. The King was charmed by the
youth’s looks and wit and insolence, made him Master of the Horse,
begged him to share the royal bed.^® But Cinq-Mars, maturing to
twenty-one, preferred the pretty courtesan Marion Delorme and the
exalted Marie de Gonzague, fu- ture Queen of Poland, now one of the
Cardinal’s loveliest enemies. Prob - ably at her suggestion, and
inflamed by her strategic retreats, the youth</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XV</p>
<p>importuned Louis for admission to the royal Council and for a command
in the army. When Richelieu discountenanced these proposals, Cinq-Mars
begged the King to dismiss the minister. Refused, he joined Gaston of
Orleans, the Duke of Bouillon, and others in a plot to surrender Sedan
to a Spanish army; with this army at their back the conspirators were to
enter Paris and take possession of the King; and Gaston pledged himself
to ar- range the assassination of the Cardinal on the way to Perpignan.
Cinq-Ma rs’ friend, Jacques Auguste de Thou, solicited the co-operation
of the Queen. But Anne of Austria, expecting Louis’ early death and her
elevation to power as regent, sent a hint of the scheme to Richelieu. He
pretended to have a copy of the agreement with Spain; Gaston, believing
it, confessed and, as usual, betrayed his associates. Cinq-Mars, de
Thou, and Bouillon were arrested; Bouillon, as the price of pardon,
confirmed Gaston’s confes - sion. The two youths were tried by a court
at Lyon; they were unanimously condemned, and they dignified their
treason with a stoic death. The King hurried back to Paris to protect
his power. Richelieu, mortally ill, was carried in a litter through a
France dying of victories and crying out for peace.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>EPITAPH</li>
</ol>
<p>What was he like, this Cardinal who was hardly a Christian, this
great man who felt that he could not afford to be good? Philippe de
Champaigne sent him down the ages in one of the most famous paintings in
the Louvre: the tall figure saved from absurdity by raiment, given
authority by red robe and hat, posing as if in some forensic plea,
proclaiming his nobility in his clear-cut features and delicate hands,
challenging his enemies with his sharp eyes, but pale with exhausting
years and saddened with the conscious- ness of inexorable time. Here is
the worldliness of power crossed with the asceticism of dedication.</p>
<p>He had to be strong to keep his faults from defeating his purposes.
He began his career at court with an ingratiating humility, which he
later avenged with a pride that admitted only one superior. Once, when
the Queen visited him, he remained seated — a discourtesy permitted only
to the King. He was (like most of us) vain of his appearance, avid of
titles, resentful of criticism, eager for popularity. Jealous of
Corneille, he wished to be known also as a dramatist and a poet;
actually he wrote excellent prose, as his memoirs show. As readily as
Wolsey he reconciled the following of Christ with a cautious attention
to Mammon. He refused bribes and took no salary, but he appropriated the
income of many benefices, alleging his need to finance his policies.
Like Wolsey, he built himself so splendid a</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>palace that before he died he thought it wise to present it to the
Dauphin; so the Palais Cardinal became the Palais Royal; we may suppose
that it was built for an administrative staff and diplomatic show rather
than for per- sonal extravagance. He was no miser; he enriched his
relatives and could be generous with the money of the state. He
bequeathed half of his personal hoard to the King, advising him to use
it “on occasions which cannot abide the tardiness of financial
forms.”®®</p>
<p>What appears as his unfeeling cruelty was to him a necessity of rule:
he took it for granted that men — certainly states — could not be
managed by kindness; they had to be intimidated by severity. He loved
France, but Frenchmen left him cold. He agreed with Cosimo de’ M edici
that a state cannot be governed with paternosters, and with Machiavelli
that the ethics of Christ cannot be safely followed in ruling or
preserving a nation. “A Christian,” he wrote, “cannot too soon forgive
an injury, but a ruler can - not too soon punish it when it is a crime
against the state. . . . Without this virtue 〔of severity〕 — which
becomes mercy insofar as the punishment of one culprit prevents a
thousand from forgetting it — ^states cannot sur- vive.”®^ It was
Richelieu who gave currency to the phrase raison d’etat: i.e., the
ethical code must give way to reasons of state.®® He seems never to have
questioned the identification of his policies with the needs of France;
hence he persecuted his personal enemies as firmly as he punished the
foes of the King.</p>
<p>Within his castle and his diplomatic front he was human, longed for
friendship, and felt the loneliness of the exalted. Tallemant’s gossipy
Historiettes would have us believe that Richelieu tried to make a
mistress of Marie de Medicis, who was twenty years older than he;®® it
is highly improbable. There are other legends of the Cardinal’s secret
amours, even with Ninon de Lenclos; and it would not have violated the
mores of the time if the harassed statesman had consoled himself with
contours. All that we know clearly of his affections is that he was
profoundly attached to his niece, Marie-Madeleine de Combalet. Widowed
soon after marriage, she wished to enter a convent, but Richelieu
persuaded the Pope to forbid it; he kept her near him to manage his
household, and he received from her a devotion intenser than most loves.
She dressed like a nun and concealed her hair. Richelieu conducted
himself toward her with all due propriety, but the Queens refused her
the benefit of any doubt, and gave a lead to gossip that added another
sting to the Cardinal’s tale. He loved “not man, nor woman neither,” and
both took their revenge.</p>
<p>What he had above all was will. Few lives in all history have been so
unified in their aim, so iindeviating in its pursuit; the laws of motion
could not be more constant. We must admire his devotion to his tasks,
his wear- ing himself out in them through years of labor and nights
without sleep.</p>
<p>390 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>He dedicated those labors to those who could sleep without fear under
cover of his sleepless care. We must concede him a surpassing courage,
which faced powerful nobles and scheming women, stood them off, killed
them off, dauntlessly, amid repeated plots against his life. He risked
his head time and again on the issue of his policies.</p>
<p>He was seldom well. Having contracted a fever from the marshes of
Poitou, he was subject to repeated headaches, which sometimes lasted for
days on end. Probably his nervous system was genetically weak or con-
genitally injured; one sister was feeble-minded, one brother was for a
while insane, and court rumor said that the Cardinal himself had fits of
epilepsy and mad hallucinations.®* He suffered from hemorrhoids, boils,
and a dis- ease of the bladder; as in Napoleon’s case, his political
crises were occasion - ally complicated by inability to urinate.®® More
than once his illnesses led him to think of retiring; then, imprisoned
in his will, he took hold again and fought on.</p>
<p>We cannot judge him fairly unless we see him wholly, including</p>
<p>features that will take form as we proceed. He was a pioneer of
religious toleration. He was a man of wide and sensitive culture; a
connoisseur of music, a discerning collector of art, a lover of drama
and poetry, a helpful friend of men of letters, the founder of the
French Academy. But history properly remembers him above all as the man
who freed France from that Spanish dominance which had resulted from the
Religious Wars and which, in the League, had made France a pensioner,
almost a dependency, of Spain. He achieved what Francis I and Henry IV
had longed and failed to do: he broke the cordon strangulaire with which
Hapsburg powers had encircled France. Later pages must detail the
far-seeing strategy whereby he decided the Thirty Years’ War, saved
German Protestantism as the ally of Catholic France, and made it
possible for Mazarin to mold the con- structive Peace of Westphalia. For
France itself he created unity and strength at the cost of a
dictatorship and a royal absolutism that in time generated the
Revolution. If it is a statesman’s prime duty to make his people happy
and free, Richelieu fell far short; Cardinal de Retz — a shrewd but not
impartial judge — condemned him as having “established the most
scandalous and dangerous tyranny that perhaps ever enslaved a state.”®®
Richelieu would have replied that the statesman is required to consider
the happiness and freedom of future generations as well as of his own,
that he must make his country strong to guard it against alien invasion
or domination, and that for this purpose he may justly sacrifice a
present generation for the security of its successors. In this sense
Richelieu’s Spanish rival, Olivares, rated him “the ablest minister that
Christendom has pos - sessed these last thousand years’’;®^ Chesterfield
ranked him as “the ablest statesman of his time, and perhaps of any
other.”®®</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>RICHELIEU</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>His return from his final victory at Roussillon was the funeral
procession of a still living man. From Tarascon to Lyon he took a barge
on the</p>
<p>Rhone; at Lyon he remained till Cinq-Mars and de Thou were tried and
dead; then, weak from the pain of an anal fistula, he had himself
carried to Paris in a litter borne by twenty-four men of his bodyguard,
and large enough to contain a bed for the dying man, a table, a chair,
and a secretary to take dictation of army orders and diplomatic
messages. Six weeks that death march took; and along the road people
gathered to get a glimpse of the man to whom they could give not love
but fear, respect, and reverence, as the awesome embodiment of both
Church and state, the vicar of God and king. Arrived in Paris, he was
moved into his palace without leaving his couch. He sent in his
resignation to his master, who refused to accept it. Louis came to his
bedside, nursed him, fed him, wondered what he would do if this
incarnate will should cease. The Cardinal’s confessor, giving him the
last sacrament, asked him if he had forgiven his enemies; he answered
that he had never had any except the enemies of France. After a day of
coma he died, December 4, 1642, aged fifty-seven. The King decreed an
entire week of funeral ceremonies; through a day and a half sight-seers
filed by his corpse. But in many provinces people kindled bonfires in
gratitude that the iron Cardinal was dead.®®</p>
<p>He continued for a time to rule France. He had recommended Giulio
Mazarini as successor to his ministry; Louis complied. He left ten
volumes of memoirs, recording the actions of the state as if they had
been not his but the King’s. In his final years he had dedicated to
Louis a Testament - terest, and become soft to the point where they are
less than women. A king, like a general, must have a masculine courage
capable of resisting emotional inclinations. He should give women no
voice in government, for they follow their moods and passions rather
than their reason.^® However, intellect in a woman is unbecoming; “I
have never seen a woman o f much learning who was not marred by her
knowledge.”*® Women cannot keep</p>
<p>392 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>the State requires it.^® The King should get “a general knowledge of
the history and constitution of all states, especially his own.”^^ And
the author asks some understanding for his ministry and his character.
“Great men who are appointed to govern states are like those condemned
to torture, with only this difference, that the latter receive the
punishment of their crimes, the former of their merits.”^®</p>
<p>The King survived him by five months. Louis’ brief rule was
gratefully remembered, for he released political prisoners, suffered
exiles to return, and allowed France to breathe. He complained that the
Cardinal had not permitted him to act as he wished. His mother had died
a few months before Richelieu; he had her remains brought from Cologne
and gave them stately burial, and in his last moments he repeatedly
prayed that God and man would pardon the harshness he had shown to
her.</p>
<p>He saw himself failing, but rejoiced in the vigor and beauty of his
four- year- old son. “What is your name?” he asked playfully. “Louis the
Four - teenth,” answered the boy. “Not yet, my son, not yet,” said the
King, smiling. He bade the court accept the regency of the Queen until
his son should come of age. When he was told that death was near, he
said, “Then, my God, I consent, with all my heart.”^® He died on May 14,
1643, aged forty- one. “People went to his funeral as to a wedding,”
Tallemant re - ported, “and appeared before the Queen as at a
tourney.”®® The terrible Cardinal had made everything ready for le grand
monarque and le grand siecle.</p>
