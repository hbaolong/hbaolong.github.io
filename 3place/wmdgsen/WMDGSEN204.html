<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XXLife and Thought in the</p>
<p>Second Century</p>
<p>A.D. 96-192</p>
<p>I. TACITUS</p>
<p>T HE policies of Nerva and Trajan liberated the suppressed mind
of</p>
<p>Rome, and gave to the literature of their reigns a note of fierce
resent- men t against a despotism that had gone but might come again.
Pliny’s Pane - gyric voiced it in welcoming the first of three great
Spaniards to the throne; Juvenal seldom sang any other note; and
Tacitus, the most brilliant of historians, became a delator temporis
acti, an accuser of times past, and excoriated a century with his
pen.</p>
<p>We do not know the date or place of Tacitus’ birth, nor even his
given name. Probably he was the son of Cornelius Tacitus, procurator of
imperial revenue in Belgic Gaul; thr ough this man’s advancement the
family was raised from the equestrian class into the new aristocracy. 1
Our first definite fact about the historian is his own statement:
“Agricola, during his consul - ship (78) … agreed to a marriage between
myself and his daughter,</p>
<p>who might certainly have looked for a prouder connection.” 2 He had
re - ceived the usual education, and had learned to the full those
oratorical arts which enliven his style, that skill in pros and cons
which marks the</p>
<p>speeches in his histories. The younger Pliny often heard him in the
courts, admired his “stately eloquence,” and acclaimed him as the
greatest orator in Rome. 3 In 88 Tacitus was praetor; thereafter he sat
in the Senate and con- fesses with shame 4 that he failed to speak out
against tyranny, and joined in the Senatorial condemnation of Domitian’s
Senatorial victims. Nerva made him consul (97), and Trajan appointed him
proconsul of Asia. He was evidently a man of affairs and practical
experience; his books were the afterthought of a full life, the product
of a leisurely old age, and of a mature and profound mind.</p>
<p>One theme unites them — hatred of autocracy. His Dialogue on Orators
(if it is his) attributes the decline of eloquence to the suppression of
liberty. His Agricola — the most perfect of those brief monographs to
which the</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>434 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXancients confined biography — proudly recounts the achievements of
his father-in-law as general and governor, and then bitterly records
Domitian ’s dismissal and neglect of him. The little essay On the
Situation and Origin of the Germans contrasts the virile virtues of a
free people with the degenera- tion and cowardice of Romans under the
despots. When Tacitus praises the Germans for considering infanticide an
infamy, and giving no advantage to childlessness, he is not describing
Germans but denouncing Romans. The philosophical purpose destroys the
objectivity of the study, but allows a remarkable breadth of view in a
Roman official praising the German power of resisting Rome. 6 *</p>
<p>The success of these essays induced Tacitus to illustrate the evils
of</p>
<p>tyranny by indicting the record of the despots in ruthless detail. He
began with what was freshest in his memory and in the testimony of his
older friends — the period from Galba to the death of Domitian; and when
these Historiae were acclaimed by a grateful aristocracy as the best
historical writing since Livy, he continued his story a fronte by
describing, in the Annales, the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,
and Nero. Of the four- teen (some say thirty) “books” of the Histories
four and a half remain, all devoted to the years 69 and 70; of the
Annals twelve books survive from an original sixteen or eighteen. Even
in this mutilated form they are the most powerful works in extant Roman
prose; we may vaguely imagine the grandeur and impress of the whole.
Tacitus had hoped to chronicle also the reigns of Augustus, Nerva, and
Trajan, mitigating the gloom of his published works with some
commemoration of constructive statesmanship. But the years were not
given him; and posterity has judged him, as he judged the past, from a
somber aspect alone.</p>
<p>“The chief duty of the historian,” he thought, “is to judge the
actions of men, so that the good may meet with the reward due to virtue,
and perni- cious citizens may be deterred by the condemnation that
awaits evil deeds at the tribunal of posterity.” 0 It is a strange
conception, which turns history into a Last Judgment and the historian
into God. So conceived, history is a sermon — ethics teaching by
horrible examples — and falls, as Tacitus as- sumed, under the rubric of
rhetoric. It is easy for indignation to be eloquent but hard for it to
be fair; no moralist should write history. Tacitus re- membered tyranny
too intimately to view tyrants calmly; he saw nothing in Augustus but
the destruction of freedom and supposed that all Roman genius had ended
with Actium. 7 He seems never to have thought of temper- ing his
indictments by recording the excellent administration and growing
prosperity of the provinces under the imperial monsters; no one
would</p>
<p>• It was probably written in 98, before Trajan’s campaign against the
Dacians.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 435</p>
<p>suspect, from reading him, that Rome was an empire as well as a city.
Per- haps the lost “books” viewed the provincial world; those that
remain make Tacitus a deceptive guide, who never lies but never reveals
the truth. He often cites, and sometimes critically examines, his
sources — histories, speeches, letters, Acta Diuma, Acta Senatus, and
the traditions of old families: but for the most part he has heard only
the stories of the persecuted nobility, and never imagines that the
executions of senators and the assassinations of emperors were incidents
in a long contest between vicious, cruel, and com- petent monarchs and a
decadent, cruel, and incompetent aristocracy. He is fascinated by
striking personalities and events rather than by forces, causes, ideas,
and processes; he draws the most brilliant and unjust character por-
traits in history, but he has no conception of economic influences upon
po- litical events, no interest in the life and industry of the people,
the stream of trade, the conditions of science, the status of woman, the
vicissitudes of be- lief, the achievements of poetry, philosophy, or
art. In Tacitus Seneca, Lucan, and Petronius die, but they do not write;
the emperors kill, but they do not build. Perhaps the great historian
was limited by his audience; prob- ably he read parts of his work —
following the custom of the time — to the aristocratic friends whom
Pliny describes as crowding to his receptions; he would have told us
that these men and women knew Roman life, industry, literature, and art,
and did not have to be reminded of them; what they wanted to hear, again
and again, was the exciting story of the evil emperors, the heroic deeds
of stoic senators, the long war of their noble class against tyrannical
power. We cannot condemn Tacitus for not succeeding in what he did not
attempt; we can only regret the narrowness of his great purpose and the
limitations of his powerful mind.</p>
<p>He does not pretend to be a philosopher. He praises Agricola’s mother
for dissuading he r son, who “had acquired a keener zest for philosophy
than became a Roman and a senator.” 8 His imagination and art, like
Shakespeare’s, were too creatively active to let him ponder quietly the
meaning and possi- bilities of life. He is as rich in illuminating
comment as in unverified scandal; but it is difficult to find in him any
consistent view of God, or man, or the state. He is cautiously ambiguous
on matters of faith, and suggests 0 that it is wiser to accept one’s
native religion than to try to replace it with knowl- edge. He rejects
most astrologers, auguries, portents, and miracles, but accepts some; he
is too much of a gentleman to deny the possibility of what so many have
affirmed. In general, events seem to prove “the indifference of th e
gods to good and bad alike,” 10 and the existence of some unknown,
perhaps capricious, force that drives men and states fatally onward to
their destiny n — urgentibiis imperii fatis . 12 He hopes that Agricola
has departed</p>
<p>43 &lt;5 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXto a happy life, but he obviously doubts it, and contents himself
with the last delusion of great minds — an immortality of fame. 18</p>
<p>Nor does any utopian aspiration console him. “Most plans of reforma -
tion are at first embraced with ardor; but soon the novelty ceases, and
the scheme ends in nothing.” 14 Matters are temporarily better in his
time, he reluctantly admits; but not even the genius of Trajan will
prevent renewed deterioration. 15 Rome is rotten literally to the core,
in the hearts of men, of a populace whose disorder of soul has made an
anarchy of freedom, 16 a rabble “fond of innovation and change, and ever
ready to shift to the side of the strongest.” 17 He mourns the
“malignity of the human mind,” 18 and scorns like Juvenal the alien
stocks in Rome. After blackening the Empire he does not dream of
returning to the Republic, but hopes that the adoptive emperors will
reconcile the Principate with liberty. 10 In the end, he thinks,
character is more important than government; what makes a people great
is not its laws but its men.</p>
<p>If, despite our surprise in finding a sermon and a drama where we had
looked for history, we must nevertheless rank Tacitus among the greatest
of historians, it is because the power of his art redeems the
limitations of his view. Above all he sees intensely, sometimes deeply,
always vividly. The portraits he draws stand out more clearly, stride
the stage more livingly, than any others in historical literature. Here,
too, however, there are blemishes. Tacitus composes speeches for his
varied personages, all in his own fashion and majestic prose; he
describes Galba as a simpleton and makes him talk like a sage. 20 And he
does not rise to the difficult art of malting his char- acters develop
in time. Tiberius is the same at the beginning of his reign as at the
end; and if he appeared to be human at the outset it was, Tacitus
thinks, pure dissimulation.</p>
<p>First and last in Tacitus is the splendor of his style. No other
author has ever said so much so compactly. This does not mean that he is
brief; on the contrary, he is desultory and diffuse and takes 400 pages
of the Histories to chronicle two years of time. Sometimes the
condensation is extreme to the point of affectation or obscurity; every
second word then requires a sentence to translate it; verbs and
conjunctions are disdained as crutches for crippled minds. This is the
culmination of Sallust’s concise rapidity, of Seneca’s pithy epigrams,
of the balanced clauses taught in the scho ols of rhetoric. In a long
work such a style, unrelieved with passages of a more even tenor,
becomes an exhausting excitement to the reader, who neverthe- less
returns to it with mounting fascination. This martial brusqueness, more
economical of words than of men, this scorn of the props of syntax, this
passion of feeling and clearness of visualization, this tang of a novel
vocabu- lary and murderous pungency of unhackneyed phrase, give to the
writing</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 437</p>
<p>of Tacitus a swiftness, color, and force which no ancient author has
equaled. The color is dark, the mood is gloomy, the sarcasm stings, and
the tone of the whole is that of a Dante without tenderness; but the
cumulative effect is overwhelming. Along this black river of relentless
exposure we are carried, despite our reservations and objections, by a
narrative at once dignified and turbulent, stately and impetuous.
Character after character rises upon the stage and is struck down; scene
after scene rushes on until all Rome seems ruined and all the
participants are dead. We can hardly believe, when we emerge from this
chamber of horrors, that this period of despotism, coward- ice, and
immorality flowed into the zenith of monarchy under Hadrian and the
Antonines, and the quiet decency of Pliny’s friends.</p>
<p>Tacitus was wrong in scorning philosophy — that is, perspective; all
his faults were due to lack of it. If he could have disciplined his pen
to the service of an open mind, he would have placed his name first on
the list of those who have labored to give form and permanence to the
memory and heritage of mankind.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>JUVENAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, Juvenal corroborates Tacitus. What the one writes in
mordant prose about princes and senators, the other chants in bitter
verse about women and men.</p>
<p>Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis, son of a rich freedman, was born at Aquinum
in Latium (59). He came to Rome for his education and practiced law
there “for his own amusement.” His satires betray the shock of rural ta
stes struck by the loose turmoil of city life; yet he appears to have
been friends with Martial, whose epigrams show no prejudice in favor of
morality. Shortly before Domitian’s death, says an uncertain tradition,
Juvenal composed, and circulated among his friends, a satire on the
influence of dancers at court; the pantomime actor Paris, we are told,
took offense and had him exiled to Egypt. We cannot say if the story is
true, nor when Juvenal re- turned; in any case he published nothing till
after D omitian’s death. The first volume of his sixteen satires
appeared in 101, the remainder in four volumes at intervals in a long
life. Probably they were unforgiving memories of Domitian’s time; but
the indignation that makes them so vivid and un - reliab le suggests
that a few years of “the good emperors” had not cured the evils he
denounced. Perhaps, again, he chose the satire as a characteristic Roman
form, found models and some material in Lucilius, Horace, and Persius,
and molded his fulminations and his wrath on the rhetorical prin- ciples
that he had learned in the schools. We shall never know how darkly</p>
<p>43&amp; CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXour picture of imperial Rome has been colored by the pleasures of
denuncia- tion.</p>
<p>Juvenal takes everything for his subject, and has no trouble in
finding in everything some aspect that can bear condemning. “We are
arrived at the zenith of vice,” he thinks, “and posterity will never be
able to surpass us”; 21 so far, so true. The root of the evil is the u
nscrupulous pursuit of wealth. He scorns the plebs that once ruled
armies and unmade kings but can now be bought with panem et circenses,
bread and circuses ; 23 this is one of a hundred phrases to which
Juvenal’s vitality gave lasting life. He resents the influx of Oriental
faces, dress, ways, smells, and gods; protests against the clannishness
of the Jew, and likes least of all the “greedy little</p>
<p>His sixth and bitterest satire is devoted to the gentler sex.
Postumus is thinking of marriage; don’t do it, Juvenal warns him; and
then the poet por- trays the women of Rome as selfish, shrewish,
superstitious, extravagant, quarrelsome, haughty, vain, litigious,
adulterous, equaling every marriage with a divorce, substituting lapdogs
for children , 24 going in for athletics, worse yet for literature,
quoting Virgil at you, spouting rhetoric and phi- losophy 25 — “oh, may
the gods save us from a learned wife!” 26 He concludes that there is
hardly a woman in the city worth marrying. A good wife is a rare bird
(jar a avis ) , stranger than a white crow. He marvels that Postumus
should think of marriage when “there are so many halters to be had, so
many high and dizzy windows are accessible, and the Aemilian Bridge is
close at hand.” No; stay single. And get out of this nerve -wearying
bedlam called Rome and live in some quiet Italian town where you will
meet honest men and be safe from criminals, poets, collapsing tenements,
and Greeks . 27 Put ambition behind you; the goal is not worth the
striving, so long is labor and so brief is fame. Live simply, cultivate
your garden, desire only so much as hunger and thirst, cold and heat
demand ; 28 learn pity, be kind to children, keep a sane mind in a
healthy body (mens Sana in corpore sano a8 ) . But only a fool will pray
for a long life.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 439</p>
<p>We can understand such a mood; it is pleasant to contemplate the im-
perfections of our neighbors and the despicable inferiority of the world
as compared with our dreams. Our enjoyment in this case is sharpened by
Juvenal’s street -corner vocabulary, his easy-moving colloquial
hexameters, his grim humor, and his lusty style. But we must not take
him literally. He was angry; he had not made his way in Rome as rapidly
as he had hoped; it was sweet revenge to lay about him with the bludgeon
of a hatred that never feigned to be fair. His moral standard was high
and sound, though tinged with conservative prejudices and delusions
about the virtuous past; by those standards, used without mercy or
modesty, we could indict any generation anywhere. Seneca knew how old a
pastime this is. “Our fore - fathers,” he wrote, “complained, we
complain, and our descendants will complain, that morals are corrupt,
that wickedness holds sway, that men are sinking deeper and deeper into
sinfulness, that the condition of mankind is going from bad to worse.”
30 Around the immoral hub of any society is a spreading wheel of
wholesome life, in which the threads of tradition, the moral imperatives
of religion, the economic compulsions of the family, the instinctive
love and care of children, the watchfulness of women and police- men,
suffice to keep us publicly decent and moderately sane. Juvenal is the
greatest of Roman satirists, as Tacitus is the greatest of Roman
historians; but we should err as much in taking their picture as
accurate as we should were we to accept without scrutiny the pleasant
and civilized scene that rises before us as we read the letters of
Pliny.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>A ROMAN GENTLEMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>When he was born at Como in 61 he was named Publius Caecilius</p>
<p>Secundus. His father owned a farm and villa near the lake and held
high office in the town. Orphaned early, Publius was adopted and
educated first by Virginius Rufus, governor of Upper Germany, and then
by his uncle Caius Plinius Secundus, author of the Natural History. This
busy scholar made the boy his son and heir and died soon afterward.
According to custom, the youth took his adoptive father’s name, causing
confusion for 2000 years. At Rome he studied under Quintilian, who
formed his taste on Cicero and must receive some of the credit for the
Ciceronian fluency of Pliny’s style. At 18 he was admitted to the bar;
at 39 he was chosen to deliver an address of welcome to Trajan. In the
same year he was made consul; in 103, augur; in 105, “Curator of the Bed
and Banks of the Tiber and the City Sewers.” He took no fees or gifts
for his legal services, but he was a rich man and could afford to be
magnanimous. He had properties in</p>
<p>44° CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXEtruria, at Beneventum, Como, and Laurentum, and offered 3,000,000
sesterces for another. 31</p>
<p>Like many aristocrats of his time, he amused himself by writing: at
first a Greek tragedy, then some poems, lighthearted and occasionally
obscene. Reproved by some, he confessed his fault impenitently, and
proposed again “to indulge in mirth, wit, and gaiety, and enter into the
spirit of the most wanton muse.” 82 Hearing his letters praised, he
composed some for publica - tion and issued them at intervals from 97 to
109. Intended not only for the public but for the pleasure of the
circles he described, they avoided the darker aspects of Roman life and
passed by as too serious for his purpose the larger problems of
philosophy and statesmanship. Their worth is in their graceful intimacy,
and in the rosy light they shed upon Roman character and patrician
ways.</p>
<p>Pliny reveals himself with half the candor and all the felicity
of</p>
<p>Montaigne. He has an author’s inevitable vanity, but so openly tha t
it hardly offends. “Nothing, I confess, so strongly affects me as the
desire of a lasting name.” 83 He speaks appreciatively of others as well
as of himself, adding that “one may be sure a man has many virtues if he
admires those of others”; 84 in an y case it is a relief, coming from
Juvenal and Tacitus, to hear an author speak well of his fellow men. He
was as generous in act as in words, ever ready with favors, loans, or
gifts, from finding a husband for a friend’s niece to enriching his
native t own. Finding that Quintilian could not give his daughter a
dowry befitting the high station of the man she was marrying, he sent
her 50,000 sesterces, excusing the smallness of the gift. 85 He gave an
old schoolmate 300,000 to make him eligible for the equestrian class;
when the daughter of a friend inherited a legacy of debts he paid them
off; and at some risk he lent a considerable sum to a philosopher
banished by Domitian. To Como he gave a temple, a secondary school, an
institute for poor children, a municipal bath, and 11,000,000 sesterces
for a public library.</p>
<p>What is especially pleasing in him is his love for his home, or his
homes. He does not denounce Rome, but he is happier in Como or
Laurentum, near the lake or the sea. There his chief enterprises are
reading and doing nothing. He loves his gardens, and the mountain
scenery behind them; he did not have to wait for Rousseau to make him
enjoy nature. He speaks with the greatest tenderness of his third wife,
Calpurnia, her sweet temper and pure mind, her fond delight in his
success and his books. She read them all (he believed) and learned many
of his pages by heart; she set his poems to music and sang them, and had
a private corps of couriers to keep her informed of every development
when he was trying an important case. She was but one of many good women
in his circle. He tells of the modesty, patience, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 44I</p>
<p>courage of a fourteen-year-old girl who, just betrothed, learned that
she had an incurable illness, and cheerfully awaited death ;- 88 of
Pompeius Satuminus’ wife, whose letters to her husband were lyrics of
affection and fine Latin; 87 of Thrasea’s daughter Fannia, who
uncomplainingly bore exile for defending her husband Helvidius, nursed a

courage!” 38</p>
<p>He had a hundred friends, some great, many good. He joined with</p>
<p>Tacitus in prosecuting Marius Priscus for dishonesty and cruelty as
pro- consul in Africa; the two orators corrected each other’s speeches
and in - vested in mutual compliments; Tacitus lifted Pliny to heaven by
reporting that the literary world was pairing them as the leading
writers of the age . 89 He knew Martial, but from an aristocratic
distance. He took Suetonius with him to Bithynia and helped him to get
the “right of three children” without having any. His circle buzzed with
literary and musical amateurs, with p ublic recitals of poetry and
speeches. “I do not believe,” says the learned Boissier, “that in any
other period has literature been so greatly loved.” 40 Homer and Virgil
were being studied on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine, and the
Thames was trembling with rhetoric . 41 It was, in its upper half, an
elegant and amiable society, rich in loving marriages, parental
affection, humane masters, sincere friendships, and fine courtesies. “I

<p>Most of the men whom Pliny describes were members of the new</p>
<p>aristocracy stemming from the provinces; they were not idlers, for
nearly every one of them held public office and shared in the admirable
adminis- tration of the Empire under Trajan. Pliny himself was sent as
propraetor to Bithynia to restore the solvency of some cities there. His
letters include some inquiries addressed to the Prince, and Trajan’s
pithy replies; they show Pliny accomplishing his mission with ability
and honor, though with a strangely detailed dependence upon the
Emperor’s advice. H is final letter begs forgiveness for sending his
sick wife home by the coaches of the im- perial post. Thereafter Pliny
disappears from literature and history, leaving behind him a redeeming
picture of a Roman gentleman, and of Italy in her happiest age.</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhad made its great effort from Ennius to Tacitus and had spent
itself. It is a shock to pass from the grandeur of the Histories and the
Annals to the scandalous chronicle of Suetonius* Lives of Illustrious
Men ( 1 10) ; history is here degenerat- ing into biography, and
biography into anecdote; portents and miracles and superstitions crowd
the pages, and only the Elizabethan English of Philemon Holland’s
translation (1606) has raised the book to the level of literature. Less
disturbing is the descent from Pliny to the letters of Fronto. Perhaps
these were not meant for publication, and cannot be fairly compared with
Pliny’s; some were spoiled by a search for archaic phraseology, but many
are touched by real affection of the teacher for his pupil. Aulus
Gellius supported the archaizing movement in his Attic Nights (169) —
the largest collection of worthless trifles in ancient literature; and
Apuleius brought it to a climax in The Golden Ass. Apuleius and Fronto
came from Africa, and the fad may have had partial source in the fact
that written Latin there had departed less than in Rome from the
language of the people and the Republic. Fronto rightly believed in
strengthen- ing literature with popular speech, as one freshens a plant
by turning over the earth at its roots. But youth does not come twice to
a man, a nation, a literature, or a language. Orientalization had set in
and could not be stopped. The common Greek tongue of the Hellenistic
East and Oriental Rome was becoming the language of literature as well
as o f life; Fronto’s pupil chose it for his Meditations. Appian, an
Alexandrian Greek living at Rome, chose Greek for his vivid Histories of
Rome’s wars ( ca . 160); so did Claudius Aelian, a Roman by birth and
blood; a half century later Dio Cassius, a Roman senator, would write
his history of Rome in Greek. Leadership in literature was passing back
from Rome to the Greek East; not to the Greek spirit, but to the
Oriental soul using Hellenic speech. There would be giants again in
Latin; but they would be Christian saints. Roman art declined more
slowly than Roman letters. Technical ability lin- gered on and produced
good architecture, sculpture, painting, and mosaic. The head of Nerva,
in the Vatican, carries on the vivid realism of Flavian portraits, and
the Column of Trajan is an impressive relief despite much crudity.
Hadrian labored to revive Hellenic classicism, but found no one to play
Pheidias to his Pericles; the inspiration that had stirred Greece after
Marathon, and Rome after Actium, was missing in an age of
self-limitation, contentment, and peace. The busts of Hadrian lose
character by their smooth Hellenistic lines; the heads of Plotina and
Sabina are pretty; but the portraits of Antinoiis repel us by their
sleek effeminate insipidit y. Probably Hadrian’s classical reaction was
a mistake: it ended the forceful naturalism and individuation of Flavian
and Trajanic sculp- ture, which had had indigenous roots in Italian
tradition and character. Nothing reaches maturity except through the
fulfillment of its own nature.</p>
<p>Under the Antonines Roman sculpture had its penultimate fling. Once
at least it achieved perfection, in the figure of a young woman whose
veiled head and modest robes are molded with a bewitching delicacy and
firmness of line. 48 Al- most as good is the portrait of Marcus’
Faustina, aristocratically refined, and</p>
<p>LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY</p>

<p>carved or cast in a thousand forms, from the meditative and guileless
yet eagerly sensitive youth of the Capitoline bust to the curly-headed
professor in armor of that same collection. Every tourist knows the
stately bronze of Aurelius Im- perator on horseback, which, since
Michelangelo restored it, has dominated the piazza of Rome’s
Capitol.</p>
<p>Relief remained to the end a favorite Roman art. The Etruscan and
Hellenistic custom of carving mythological or historical scenes upon
sarcophagi returned in Hadrian’s timefas the hope of immortality took
more personal and even physical form, and burial replaced cremation.
Eleven panels surviving from triumphal arches erected to commemorate the
campaigns of Aurelius * show the naturalistic style in perfection: no
one is idealized, every participant is individualized; Marcus, receiving
without pride the submission of a fallen enemy, is an appealingly human
figure; and the defeated are shown not as barbarians but as men worthy
of their long struggle for freedom. In 174 the Senate and people of Rome
raised that Column of Aurelius which still adorns the Piazza Colonna;
inspired by Trajan’s Column, it pictured the Marcomannic Wars with a
sympathetic art that honored conquerors and conquered alike.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Emperor had helped to form the art and morals of
his time. The games were less cruel, the laws more considerate of the
weak; marriage was apparently more lasting and content. Immorality
continued, openly in a minority, clandestinely in the majority, as at
all times; but it had passed its peak with Nero and had ceased to be
fashionable. Men as well as women were returning to the old religion or
devoting themselves to new ones; and the philosophers approved. Rome was
now teeming v/ith them, invited, welcomed, or tolerated by Aurelius;
they took full advantage of his generosity and his power, crowded his
court, re- ceived appointments and emoluments, delivered countless
lectures, and opened many schools. In their imperial pupil they gave the
world the culmination and disintegration of ancient philosophy.</p>
<p>V. THE EMPEROR AS PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>Six years before his death Marcus Aurelius sat down in his tent to
formu- late his thoughts on human life and destiny. We cannot be sure
that the Taeis heauton — “to himself”— was intended for the public eye;
probably so, for even saints are vain, and the greatest man of action
has moments of weakness in which he aspires to write a book. Marcus was
not an expert author; most of the training that Fronto had given him in
Latin was wasted now, since he wrote in Greek; besides, these “Golden
Thoughts” were penned in the intervals of travel, battles, revolts, and
many tribulations; we must forgive them for being disconnected and
formless, often repetitious,</p>

<p>444 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXsometimes dull. The book is precious only for its contents — its
tenderness and candor, its half-conscious revelations of a
pagan-Christian, ancient-medieval soul.</p>
<p>Like most thinkers of his time, Aurelius conceived philosophy not as
a speculative description of infinity, but as a school of virtue and a
way of life. He hardly bothers to make up his mind about God; sometimes
he talks like an agnostic, acknowledging that he does not know; but
having made that admission, he accepts the traditional faith with a
simple piety. “Of what</p>
<p>He admits the difficulty of reconciling evil, suffering, apparently
un-</p>
<p>merited misfortune, with a good Providence; but we cannot judge the
place of any element or event in the scheme of things unless we see the
whole; and who shall pretend to such total perspective? It is therefore
insolent and ridiculous for us to judge the world; wisdom lies in
recognizing our limita- tions, in seeking to be harmonious parts of the
universal order, in trying to sense the Mind behind the body of the
world, and co-operating with it willingly. To one who has reached this
view “everything that happens hap - pens justly”— i.e., as in the course
of nature; 4T nothing that is according to nature can be evil ; 48
everything natural is beautiful to him who under- stands . 40 All things
are determined by the universal reason, the inherent logic of the whole;
and every part must welcome cheerfully its modest role and fate.
“Equanimity” (the watchword of the dying Antoninus) “is the volun - tary
acceptance of the things that are assigned to thee by the nature of the
whole .” 50</p>
<p>Everything harmonizes with me that harmonizes with thee, O</p>
<p>universe. Nothing for me is too early or too late which is in due
time for thee. Everything is fruit to me that thy seasons bring, O
Nature.</p>

things</p>
<p>return . 51</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 445</p>
<p>Knowledge is of value only as a tool of the go od life. “What, then,
can direct a man? One thing only — philosophy” “— not as logic or
learning, but as a persistent training in moral excellence. “Be thou
erect, or be made erect.” 63 God has given every man a guiding daimon,
or inner spirit— his reason. Virtue is the life of reason.</p>
<p>These are the principles of the rational soul. It traverses the
whole</p>
<p>universe, and surveys its form, and extends itself into the infinity
of</p>
<p>time, and embraces the cyclical renewal of all things, and
compre-</p>
<p>hends that those who come after us will see nothing new, nor have</p>
<p>those before us seen anything more; but in a manner he who is forty
years old, if he has any understanding at all, has seen, by virtue of
this uniformity, all things that have been or will be . 64</p>
<p>Marcus thinks his premises compel him to puritanism. “Pleasure is
neither good nor useful.” 65 He renounces the flesh and all its works,
and talks at times like some Anthony in the Thebaid:</p>
<p>Observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was
yesterday a little mucus, tomorrow will be a mummy or ashes.</p>
<p>. . . The whole space of man’s life is but little, and yet with
what</p>
<p>troubles it is filled . . . and with what a wretched body it must
be</p>
<p>passed! . . . Turn it inside out, and see what kind of thing it is .
60</p>
<p>The mind must be a citadel free from bodily desires, passions, anger,
or hate. It must be so absorbed in its work as hardly to notice the
adversities of fortune or the barbs of enmity. “Every man is worth just
so much as the things about which he busies himself.” 57 He reluctantly
concedes that there</p>
<p>determinism of circumstance . 58 “If any man has done thee wrong, the
harm is his own; it is thy duty to forgive him.” 50 If the existence of
evil men saddens you, think of the many fine persons you have met, and
the many virtues that are mingled in imperfect, characters . 60 Good or
bad, all men are brothers, kinsmen in one God; even the ugliest
barbarian is a citizen of the fatherland to which we all belong. “As
Aurelius I have Rome for my country; as a man, the world.” 61 Does this
seem an impracticable philos - ophy? On the contrary, nothing is so
invincible as a good disposition, if it be sincere . 02 A really good
man is immune to misfortune, for whatever evil befalls him leaves him
still his own soul.</p>
<p>Will this 〔evil〕 that has happened prevent thee from being
just,</p>
<p>magnanimous, temperate, prudent . . . modest, free? . . . Suppose</p>
<p>that men curse thee, kill thee, cut thee in pieces: what can these
things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure, wise, sober, and
just?</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXIf a man stand by a limpid, pure spring and curse it, the spring
never ceases to send up clean water; if he cast dirt into it, or filth,
it will</p>
<p>speedily wash them out and be unpolluted again. . . . On every
oc-</p>
<p>casion that brings thee trouble, remember to apply this
principle:</p>

lays</p>
<p>hold of, he is able to live a fife that flows on quietly and is like
the</p>
<p>existence of the gods . 68</p>
<p>Marcus’ life, however, did not flow on quietly; he had to kill
Germans while writing this Fifth Gospel, and in the end he faced death
with no consolation in the son who would succeed him, and no hope of
happiness beyond the grave. Soul and body alike return to their original
elements. For as the mutation and dissolution of bodies make room for
other</p>
<p>bodies doomed to die, so the souls that are removed into the air,
after life’s existence, are transmuted and diffused . . . into the
seminal</p>

in content, just as an olive falls when it is ripe, blessing the nature
that produced it, and thanking the tree on which it grew . 65</p>

<li>COMMODUS</li>
</ol>
<p>When the officer of the guard asked the dying Marcus for the
watchword of the day he answered: “Go to the rising sun; my sun is
setting.” The rising sun was then nineteen, a robust and dashing youth
without inhibitions, morals, or fear. One would have expected of him,
rather than of Marcus the ailing saint, a policy of war to victory or
death; instead, he offered the enemy immediate peace. They were to
withdraw from the vicinity of the Danube, to surrender most of their
arms, return all Roman prisoners and deserters, pay Rome an annual
tribute of corn, and persuade 13,000 of their soldiers to enlist in the
Roman legions. 08 All Rome condemned him except the people; his generals
fumed at allowing the trapped prey to escape and fight again another
day. During the reign of Commodus, how- ever, no trouble came from the
Danubian tribes.</p>
<p>The young prince, though no coward, had seen enough of war; he needed
peace to enjoy Rome. Back in the capital, he snubbed the Senate and
loaded the plebs with unprecedented gifts — 725 denarii to each citizen.
Finding no field in politics for his exuberant strength, he hunted
beasts on</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 447</p>
<p>the imperial estates and developed such skill with sword and bow that
he decided to perform publicly. For a time he left the palace and lived
in the gladiators’ schoo l; he drove chariots in the races, and fought
in the arena against animals and men. 07 Presumably the men who opposed
him took care to let him win; but he thought nothing of fighting,
unaided and before breakfast, a hippopotamus, an elephant, and a tiger,
which made no dis- tinctions for royalty. 08 He was so perfect a bowman
that with a hundred arrows he killed a hundred tigers in one exhibition.
He would let a panther leap upon some condemned criminal and then slay
the animal with one arrow, leaving the man unhurt to die again. 09 He
had his exploits recorded in the Acta Diurna and insisted on being paid,
out of the Treasury, for each of his thousand combats as a
gladiator.</p>
<p>The historians upon whom we must here depend wrote, like Tacitus,
from the viewpoint and traditions of the offended aristocracy; we cannot
tell how much of the marvels they relate are history, how much are re-
venge. We are assured that Commodus drank and gambled, wasted the public
funds, kept a harem of 300 women and 300 boys, and liked to vary his sex
occasionally, at least by using a woman’s garb, even at the public
games. Tales of unbelievable cruelty are transmitted to us: Commodus
ordered a votary of Bellona to amputate an arm in proof of piety; forced
some women devotees of Isis to beat their breasts with pine cones till
they died; killed men indiscriminately with his club of Hercules;
gathered cripples together and slew them one by one with arrows. . . .
70 One of his mistresses, Marcia, was apparently a Christian; for her
sake, we are told, he pardoned some Christians who had been condemned to
the Sardinian mines. Her devotion to him suggests that in this man,
described as more bestial than any beast, there was some lovable element
unrecorded by history.</p>
<p>Like his predecessors, he was aroused to the wildest ferocity by fear
of assassination. His aunt Lucilla formed a conspiracy to kill him; he
discovered it, had her executed, and on proof or suspicion of
participation put so many men of rank to death that soon hardly any
survived who had been prominent in Marcus’ reign. Delators, who had
almost disappeared for a century, re - turned to activity and favor, and
a new terror raged in Rome. Appointing Perennis as praetorian prefect,
Commodus yielded the reins of government to him, and (the tradition
says) abandoned himself to sexual dissipation. Perennis ruled
efficiently but mercilessly; he organized his own terror and had all his
opponents slain. The Emperor, suspecting that Perennis planned to
replace him, surrendered this second Sejanus to the Senate, which re-
enacted its role of glowing revenge. Cleander, a former slave, succeeded
Perennis (185) and surpassed him in corruption and cruelty; any
office</p>
<p>448 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXmight be had for a proper bribe, any decision of any court could be
re- versed. Under his orders senators and knights were put to death for
treason or criticism. In 190 a mob besieged the villa where Commodus was
staying and demanded Oleander’s death. The Emper or accommodated them.
Oleander’s successor, Laetus, after holding power for three years,
judged that his time had come. One day he chanced upon a proscription
list that contained the names of his supporters and friends, and of
Marcia. On the last day of 192 Marcia gave Commodus a cup of poison; and
when it worked too slowly the athlete whom he had kept to wrestle with
strangled him in his bath. He was a youth of thirty-one.</p>
<p>When Marcus died Rome had reached the apex of her curve and was
already touched with decay. Her boundaries had been extended beyond the
Danube, into Scotland and the Sahara, into the Caucasus and Russia, and
to the gates of Parthia. She had accomplished for that confusion of
peoples and faiths a unity not of language and culture, but at least of
economy and law. She had woven it into a majestic commonwealth, within
which the exchange of goods moved in unprecedented plenty and freedom;
and for two centuries she had guarded the great realm from barbarian
inroads and had given it security and peace. All the white man’s world
looked to her as the center of the universe, the omnipotent and eternal
city. Never had there been such wealth, such splendor, or such
power.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, amid the prosperity that made Rome brilliant in this
second century, all the seeds were germinating of the crisis that would
ruin Italy in the third. Marcus had contributed heavily to the debacle
by naming Commodus his heir and by wars that centralized ever more
authority in the hands of the Emperor. Commodus kept in peace the
prerogatives assumed by Aurelius in war. Private and local independence,
initiative, and pride withered as the power and functions of the state
increased; and the wealth of nations was drained away by ever-rising
taxation to support a self- multiplying bureaucracy and the endless
offensives of defense. The mineral wealth of Italy was diminishing, 71
pestilence and famine had taken bitter toll, the system of tillage by
slaves was failing, governmental expenditures and doles had exhausted
the Treasury and debased the currency. Italian industry was losing its
markets in the provinces through provincial compe- tition, and no
economic statesmanship appeared to make up for a languish- ing foreign
trade by a wider distribution of buying power at home. Mean- while the
provinces had recovered from the exactions of Sulla, Pompey, Caesar,
Cassius, Brutus, and Antony; their ancient skills had revived, their
industries were flourishing, their new wealth was financing science,
philos- ophy, and art. Their sons replenished the legions, their
generals led them; soon their armies would hold Italy at their mercy and
make their generals</p>
<p>CHAP, xx) LIFE IN THE SECOND CENTURY 449</p>
<p>emperors. The process of conquest was finished and was to be
reversed; henceforth the conquered would absorb the conquerors.</p>
<p>As if conscious of these omens and problems, the mind of Rome, at the
close of the Antonine age, sank into a cultural and spiritual fatigue.
The practical disfranchisement of first the assemblies and then the
Senate had removed the mental stimulus that comes from free political
activity and a widespread sense of liberty and power. Since the prince
had almost all authority, the citizens left him almost all
responsibility. More and more of them, even in the aristocracy, retired
into their families and their private affairs; citizens became atoms,
and society began to fall to pieces internally precisely when unity
seemed most complete. Disillusionment with democ- racy was foll owed by
disillusionment with monarchy. The “Golden</p>
<p>Thoughts” of Aurelius were often leaden thoughts, weighted down with
the suspicion that Rome’s problems could not be solved, that the
multiply - ing barbarians could not long be held back by a sterile and
pacific breed. Stoicism, which had begun by preaching strength, was
ending by preaching resignation. Almost all the philosophers had made
their peace with religion. For 400 years Stoicism had been to the upper
classes a substitute for re- ligion; now the substitute was put aside,
and the ruling orders turned back from the books of the philosophers to
the altars of the gods. And yet pagan- ism, too, was dying. Like Italy,
it was flushed only with governmental aid and was nearing exhaustion. It
had conquered philosophy; but already its temple precincts heard
reverently the names of invading deities. The age was heavy with the
resurrection of the provinces and the incredible victory of Christ.</p>
