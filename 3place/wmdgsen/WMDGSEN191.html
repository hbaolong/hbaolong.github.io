<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>The Oligarchic Reaction</p>
<p>77-60 B.C.</p>
<p>I. THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>N EVERTHELESS, Sulla had erred twice on the side of generosity.</p>
<p>He had spared the son and nephew of his enemies, the gay and
brilliant Caius Julius Caesar, who was entering his twenties in the
proscription years; Sulla had nominated him for death, but let him go on
the importuning of their common friends; his judgment, however, was not
mistaken when he remarked, “In that young man go many Mariuses.” 1 And
perhaps he erred in resigning too soon and enjoying himself to an early
end. Had his patience and insight equaled his ruthlessness and courage,
he might have saved Rome a half century of chaos and given her in 80
b.c. the peace and security, order and prosperity, that Augustus would
bring back from Actium. He restored the old when he should have created
the new.</p>
<p>Within a decade after his death his work was in ruins. Relaxed in the
arms of victory, the patricians neglected the tasks of government to
seek wealth in business and spend it in luxury. The struggle between the
opti- mates and the populates continued with a bitterness that
passionately awaited another opportunity for violence. The optimates, or
“best people,” made nobilitas their creed; not in the sense of noblesse
oblige, but on the theory that good government required the restriction
of major magistracies to men whose ancestors had held high office.
Anyone who ran for office without such forebears was scorned as novus
homo — 2. “new man,” or upstart; such were Marius a nd Cicero. The
populates demanded “career open to talent,” all power to the assemblies,
and free land for veterans and the poor. Neither party believed in
democracy; both aspired to dictatorship, and both prac- ticed
intimidation and corruption without conscience or concealment. The
collegia that had once been mutual-benefit societies became agencies for
the sale of great blocks of plebeian votes. The business of vote buying
reached a scale where it required a high specialization of labor: there
were divisores, who bought votes, interpretes, or go-betweens, and
sequesttes, who held the money until the votes had been delivered. 2
Cicero describes candidates as going about purse in hand among the
electors in the Field of Mars. 3 Pompey</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>had his mediocre friend Afranius made consul by inviting the leaders
of the tribes to his gardens and there paying them for the ballots of
their groups. 4 So much money was borrowed to finance candidacies that
the campaigns raised the interest rate to eight per cent per month.
5</p>
<p>The courts, now pre-empted by senators, rivaled the polls in
corruption. Oaths had lost all value as testimony; perjury was as common
as bribery. Marcus Messala, being indicted for buying his election to
the consulate (53), was unanimously acquitted, though even his friends
acknowledged his guilt. 0 “Trials are now managed so venally,” wrote
Cicero to his son, “that no man will ever be condemned hereafter except
for murder.” 7 He s hould have said “no man of means”; for “without
money and a good lawyer,” said another advocate at this period, “a
plain, simple defendant may be accused of any crime which he has not
committed, and will certainly be convicted.” 8 Lentulus Sura, having
been acquitted by two votes, mourned the extra expense he had gone to in
bribing one more judge than he had needed.® When Quintus Calidus,
praetor, was convicted by a jury of senators, he calculated that “they
could not honestly require less than 300,0 00 sesterces to condemn a
praetor.” 10</p>
<p>Protected by such courts, the Senatorial proconsuls, the tax
gatherers, the moneylenders, and the business agents milked the
provinces at a rate that would have angered their predecessors with
envy. There were several hon- orable and competent provincial governors,
but what could be expected of the majority? They served without pay,
usually for a year’s term; in that brief time they had to accumulate
enough to pay their debts, buy another office, and set themselves up for
life in the style befitting a great Roman. The sole check upon their
venality was the Senate; and the senators could be trusted as gentlemen
not to raise a fuss, since nearly all of them had done, or hoped soon to
do, the same. When Caesar went to Farther Spain as pro- consul in 61 he
owed ,500,000; when he returned in 60 he cleared off these debts at one
stroke. Cicero thought himself a painfully honest man; he made only
10,000 in his year as governor of Cilicia and filled his letters with
wonder at his own moderation.</p>
<p>The generals who conquered the provinces were the first to profit
from them. Lucullus, after his campaigns in the East, became a synonym
for luxury. Pompey brought in from the same region 1,200,000 for the
Treas- ury and 1,000,000 for himself and his friends; Caesar took
literally untold millions from Gaul. After the generals came the
publicans, who collected from the people twice the amount which they
remitted to Rome. When a province or city could not raise enough from
its subjects to pay the de- manded tribute or tax, Roman financiers or
statesmen would lend them the necesssary funds at from twelve to
forty-eight per cent interest, to be col-</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>lected, if need be, by the Roman army through siege, conquest, and
pillage. The Senate had forbidden its members to take part in such
loans, but pomp- ous aristocrats like Pompey, and saints like Brutus,
skirted the law by lend- ing through intermediaries. In some years the
province of Asia paid Romans twice as much in interest on loans as it
paid to the publicans and the Treas- ury. 11 The paid and unpaid
interest on money borrowed by the cities of Asia Minor to meet Sulla’s
exactions in 84 had swelled by 70 to s ix times the principal. To meet
the charges on this debt communities sold their public buildings and
statuary, and parents sold their children into slavery, for defaulting
debtors could be stretched on the rack. 12 If any wealth still remained,
a flock of entrepreneurs came in from Italy, Syria, and Greece, with
Senatorial contracts for “developing” the mineral, timber, or other
resources of the province; trade followed the flag. Some bought slaves,
some sold or bought goods, others purchased land and set up provincial
latifundia larger than those of Italy. “No Gaul,” said Cicero in 69,
with his customary exaggeration, “carries through any business without
the inter - vention of a Roman citizen; not a penny changes hands there
without passing throu gh the ledgers of a Roman.”</p>
<p>Antiquity had never known so rich, so powerful, and so corrupt a</p>
<p>government.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MILLIONAIRES</li>
</ol>
<p>The business classes reconciled themselves to the rule of the Senate
because they were better prepared than the aristocracy to exploit the
provinces. That “concord of the orders,” or co -operation of the two
upper classes, which Cicero was to preach as an ideal, was already a
reality in his youth; they had agreed to unite and conquer. Businessmen
and their aggressive agents crowded the basilicas and streets of Rome
and swarmed into provincial markets and capitals. Bankers issued letters
of exchange on their provincial affiliates, 18 and lent money for
everything, even political careers. Merchants and financiers swung their
influence to the popular es when the Senate proved selfish, and back to
the optimates when democratic leaders tried to keep their pre-election
promises to the proletariat.</p>
<p>Crassus, Atticus, and Lucullus typify the three phases of Roman
wealth: acquisition, speculation, luxury. Marcus Licinius Crassus was of
aristocratic lineage. His father, a famous orator, consul, and censor,
had fought for Sulla and had killed himself rather than yield to Marius.
Sulla rewarded the son by letting him buy at bargain prices the
confiscated properties of proscribed men. As a youth Marcus had studied
literature and philosophy and had assiduously practiced law; but now the
smell of money intoxicated him. He</p>
<p>CHAP. VII ) THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION 131</p>
<p>organized a fire brigade — something new to Rome; it ran to fires,
sold its services on the spot, or bought endangered buildings at nominal
sums and then put out the fire; in this way Crassus acquired hundreds of
houses and tenements, which he let at high rentals. He bought state
mines when Sulla denationalized them. Soon he had inflated his fortune
from 7,000,000 to 170,000,000 sesterces (5,500,000) — a sum nearly equal
to the total yearly revenue of the Treasury. No man should consider
himself rich, said Crassus. unless he could raise, equip, and maintain
his own army; 14 it was his destiny to perish by his definition. Having
become the wealthiest man in Rome, he was still unhappy; he itched for
public office, for a province, for the leader- ship of an Asiatic
campaign. He solicited votes humbly in the streets, memo- rized the
first names of countless citizens, lived in conspicuous simplicity ,
and, to tether influential politicians to his star, lent them money
without interest but payable on demand. With all his eager ambitions he
was a kindly man, accessible to everyone, generous without limit to his
friends, and con- tributing to both political parties with that
bilateral wisdom which has al- ways distinguished his kind. He fulfilled
all his dreams: he became consul in 70 and again in 55, governed Syria,
and helped to raise the great army that he led against Parthia. He was
defeated at Carrhae, treacherously cap- tured, and barbarously slain
(53) ; his head was cut off, and into the mouth his conqueror poured
molten gold.</p>
<p>Titus Pomponius Atticus, though of equestrian birth, was a truer
aristo- crat than Crassus and a higher type of millionaire: as honest as
Meyer Anschel of the rot Schild, as learned as Lorenzo de’ Medici, as
financially astute as Voltaire. We hear of him first as a student in
Athens, when his conversation, and his reading of Greek and Latin
poetry, so charmed Sulla that the blood- stained commander wished, in
vain, to take him back to Rome as a personal companion. He was a scholar
and a historian, wrote an outline of universal history, 16 lived most of
his life in the philosophical circles of Athens, and earned his cognomen
from his Attic erudition and philanthropies. His father and his uncle
left him some 60,000; he invested it in a great cattle ranch in Epirus,
in buying and letting houses in Rome, in training gladiators and
secretaries and hiring them out, and in publishing books. When good
open- ings came he lent money at profitable rates; but to Athens and his
friends he lent without interest. 16 Men like Cicero, Hortensius, and
the younger Cato entrusted him with their savings and the management of
their affairs, and honored him f or Jus caution, his integrity, and his
dividends. Cicero was glad to have his advice not only in purchasing
houses, but in choosing statu- ary to adorn them and books to fill his
library. Atticus entertained frugally and lived with the modesty of a
true Epicurean; but his genial friendship and his cultivated
conversation made his house in Rome the salon of all political</p>
<p>132 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>celebrities. He contributed to all parties and was spared in all
proscriptions. At the age of seventy-seven, finding himself afflicted
with a painful and incurable disease, he starved himself to death.</p>
<p>Lucius Licinius Lucullus, of high patrician family, sallied forth in
74 to complete Sulla’s war against Mithridates. For eight years he led
his inade - quate forces with courage and skill; then, as his campaign
was nearing full success, his tired troops mutinied, and he guided their
retreat from Armenia to Ionia through perils as great as those that had
immortalized Xenophon. Relieved of his command by political intrigue, he
returned to Rome and, with his patrimony and his spoils, spent the rest
of his life in quiet but ornate luxury. He built on the Pincian hill a
palace with spacious halls, loggias, libraries, and gardens; at Tusculum
his estate extended for many miles; he bought a villa at Misenum for
10,000,000 sesterces (,500,000); and he turned the entire island of
Nisida into his summer resort. His various gar- dens were famous for
their horticultural innovations; it was he, for example, who introduced
the cherry tree from Pontus to Italy, whence it was carried to north
Europe and America. His dinners were the culinary events of the Roman
year. Cicero tried once to find out how Lucullus ate when alone; he
asked Lucullus to invite him and some friends to dinner that evening,
but pledged Lucullus to send no word of warning to his servants.
Lucullus agreed, merely stipulating that he be allowed to notify his
staff that he would eat in the “Apollo Room” that evening. When Cicero
and the rest came</p>
<p>His example spread without his taste among the rich of Rome; soon
patri- cians and magnates were competing in luxurious display, while
revolt brewed in bankrupt provinces and men starved in the slums.
Senators lounged in bed till noon and seldom attended sessions. Some of
their sons dressed and walked like courtesans, wore frilled robes and
women’s sandals, decked themselves with jewelry, sprinkled themselves
with perfume, deferred mar- riage or avoided parentage, and emulated the
bisexual impartiality of the Greeks. Senatorial houses cost up to
10,000,000 sesterces; Clodius, leader of the plebs, built a mansion
costing 14,800,000. Lawyers like Cicero and Hor- tensius, despite the
Cincian law against legal fees, competed in palaces as well as in
oratory; the gardens of Hortensius contained the largest zoologi-</p>
<p>CHAP.vn) the oligarchic reaction 133</p>
<p>cal collection in Italy. All men of any pretension had villas at or
near Baiae, where the aristocracy took the baths, enjoyed the Bay of
Naples, and de- clared a moratorium on monogamy. Other villas rose on
the hills outside of Rome; rich men had several, moving from one to
another as the season changed. Fortunes were spent on interior
decoration, furniture, or silver plate. Cicero paid 500,000 sesterces
for a table of citrus wood; a million ses- terces might be paid for one
of cypress wood; even the younger Cato, pillar of all Stoic virtues, was
alleged to have paid 800,000 sesterces for some table spreads from
Babylon. 18</p>
<p>A horde of specialized slaves formed the staff of these palaces —
valets, letter carriers, lamplighters, musicians, secretaries, doctors,
philosophers, cooks. Eating was now the chief occupation of upper-class
Rome; there, as in the ethics of Metrodor us, “everything good had
reference to the belly.” At a repast given in 63 by a high priest, and
attended incongruously by Vestal Virgins and Caesar, the hors d’oeuvres
consisted of mussels, spondyles, fieldfares with asparagus, fattened
fowls, oyster pastries, sea nettles, ribs of roe, purple shellfish, and
songbirds. Then came the dinner — sows’ udders, boar’s head, fish, duck,
teals, hares, fowl, pastries, and sweets. 19 Delicacies</p>
<p>Some of the new wealth disported itself in enlarged theaters and
extended games. In 58 Aemilius Scaurus built a theater with 8000 seats,
360 pillars, 3000 statues, a three-storied stage, and three colonnades —
one of wood, one of marble, and one of glass; his slaves, rebelling
against the hard labor he had exacted of them, burned down the theater
soon afterward, netting him a loss of 100,000,000 sesterces. 23 In 55
Pompey provided funds for the first perma- nent stone theater in Rome —
with 17,500 seats, and a spacious porticoed park for entr’acte
promenades. In 53 Scribonius Curio, one of Caesar’s generals, erected
two wooden theaters, each a semicircle, back to back; in the morning the
two stages presented plays; then, while the spectators were still in
their seats, the two structures were turned on pivots and wheels, the
semicircles formed an amphitheater and the united stages became an arena
for gladia- torial games. 24 Never had such games been so frequent,
costly, or prolonged. In a single day of the games given by Caesar
10,000 gladiators took part,</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>*34</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>many of whom were killed. Sulla exhibited a fight involving a hundred
lions, Caesar four hundred, Pompey six hundred. Beasts fought men, men
fought men; and the vast audience waited hopefully for the sight of
death.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE NEW WOMAN</li>
</ol>
<p>The increase of wealth conspired with the corruption of politics to
loosen morals and the marriage bond. Despite increasing competition from
women and men, prostitution continued to flourish; brothels and the
taverns that usually housed them were so popular that some politicians
organized votes through the collegium lupanariorum, or guild of
brothelkeepers. 25 Adultery was so common as to attract little attention
unless played up for political purposes, and practically every
well-to-do woman had at least one divorce. This was not the fault of
women; it resulted largely from the subordination of marriage, in the
upper classes, to money and politics. Men chose wives, or youths had
wives chosen for them, to get a rich dowry or make advantageous
connections. Sulla and Pompey married five times. Seeking to attach
Pompey to him, Sulla persuaded him to put away his first wife and marry
Aermlia, Sulla’s stepdaughter, who was already married and with child;
Aemilia reluc- tantly agreed, but died in childbirth shortly after
entering Pompey’s house. Caesar gave his daughter Julia to Pompey in
marriage as an item in their triumviral alliance. The Empire, growled
Cato, had become a matrimonial agency . 2Ba Such unions were manages de
politique; as soon as their utility ended, the husband looked for
another wife as a steppingstone to higher place or greater wealth. He
did not need to give a reason; he merely sent his wife a letter
announcing her freedom and his. Some men did not marry at all, alleging
distaste for the forwardness and extravagance of the new woman; many
lived in free unions with concubines or slaves. The censor Metellus
Macedonicus ( 1 3 1 ) had begged men to marry and beget children as a
duty to the state, however much of a nuisance ( molestia ) a wife might
be; 28 but the number of celibates and childless couples increased more
rapidly after he spoke. Children were now luxuries which only the poor
could afford.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances women could hardly be blamed for looking
lightly upon their marriage vows and seeking in liaisons the romance or
affection that political matrimony had failed to bring. There was, of
course, a majority of good women, even among the rich; but a new freedom
was breaking down the old patria potestas and the ancient family
discipline. Roman women now moved about almost as freely as men. They
dressed in diaphanous silks from India and China, and ransacked Asia for
perfumes and jewelry. Marriage cum moral disappeared, and women divorced
their</p>

<p>husbands as readily as men their wives. A growing proportion of women
sought expression in cultural pursuits: they learned Greek, studied
philoso- phy, wrote poetry, gave public lectures, played, sang, and
danced, and opened literary salons ; some engaged in business; a few
practiced medicine or law.</p>
<p>Clodia, the wife of Quintus Gaecilius Metellus, was the most
prominent of those ladies who in this period supplemented their husbands
with a suc- cession of cavalieri serventi. She had a gay passion for the
rights of women; shocked the older generation by going about
unchaperoned with her male friends after her marriage; accosted people
whom she met and knew, and sometimes publicly kissed them, instead of
lowering her eyes and crouching in her carriage as proper women were
supposed to do. She invited her male friends to dine with her while her
husband absented himself with the chiv- alry of the Marquis du Chatelet.
Cicero, who cannot be trusted, describes “her loves, adulteries, and
lecheries, her songs and symphonies, her suppers and carousing, at Baiae
on land and sea.” 27 She was a clever woman, who could sin with
irresistible grace, but she underestimated the selfishness of men. Each
lover demanded her entirely until his appetite waned, and each became
her shocked enemy when she found a new friend. So Catullus (if she was
his Lesbia) besmeared her with ribald epigrams; and Caelius, alluding to
the price paid for the poorest prostitutes, called her in open court the
quadrantaria — xhz quarter-of-an-as (one-and-a-half-cent) woman. She had
accused him of trying to poison her; he hired Cicero to defend him; and
the great orator did not hesitate to charge her with incest and murder,
protest- ing, however, that he was “not the enemy of women, still less
of one who was the friend of all men.” Caelius was acquitted, and Clodia
paid some penalty for being the sister of that Publius Qodius who was
the most radical leader in Rome and Cicero’s implacable enemy.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>ANOTHER CATO</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid all this corruption and laxity one man stood out as an exemplar
and professor of the ancient ways. Marcus Porcius Cato the Younger had
vio- lated a precept of his great-great-grandfather by studying Greek;
from it he derived that Stoic philosophy which shared with his
republican convic- tions the inflexible devotion of his life. He
inherited 120 talents (32,000), but lived in sedulous simplicity. He
lent money, but took no interest. He lacked his ancestor’s rough humor,
and frightened people by what seemed to them his obstinate
incorruptibility .and his untimely addiction to princi- ples. His life
was an unforgivable indictment of theirs; they wished he would</p>

<p>sin a little, if only out of a decent respect for the habits of
mankind. They must have rejoiced when, with an almost Cynical conception
of woman as a biological instrument, he “lent” his wife Marci a to his
friend Hortensius — i.e., divorced her and assisted at her marriage to
the orator — and later, when Hortensius died, took her again to wife. 28
He could not be popular, for he was the relentless enemy of all
dishonesty, the stem defender of the patria potestas, a more merciless
censor moralium than Cato Censor himself. He seldom laughed or smiled,
made no effort to be affable, and sharply repri- manded any who dared to
flatter him. He was defeated for the consulship, said Cicero, because he
ac ted like a citizen in Plato’s republic instead of a Roman living
among “the dregs of Romulus’ posterity.” 29</p>
<p>As quaestor Cato made himself a terror to all incompetence and
malfeas- ance, and guarded the Treasury ferociously from all political
raids; nor did his watchfulness abate when his term expired. His
indictments fell upon all parties and left him with a thousand admirers
but hardly a friend. As praetor he persuaded the Senate to issue an
order that all candidates, soon after election, must come into court and
give under oath a detailed account of their expenses and proceedings in
the campaign. The measure disturbed so many politicians, most of whom
depended upon bribery, that they and their clients, when Cato next
appeared in the Forum, reviled and stoned him; whereupon he climbed to
the rostrum, faced the crowd resolutely, and talked them into
submission. As tribune he led a legion into Macedonia; his attendants
rode on horseback, he went on foot. He scorned the business classes and
defended aristocracy, or rule by birth, as the only alternative to
plutocracy, or rule by wealth. He warred without truce upon the men who
were corrupting Roman politics with money, and Roman character with
luxury; and he stood out to the last against every move, by either
Pompey or Caesar, toward dictatorship. When Caesar had overthrown the
Republic Cato died by his own hand, with a volume of philosophy by his
side.</p>
<p>V. SPARTACUS</p>
<p>Misgovernment now reached a height, and democracy a depth, rare in
the history of states. In 98 b.c. the Roman general Didius repeated the
exploit of Sulpicius Galba: he lured a whole tribe of troublesome
natives into a Roman camp in Spain by pretending to register them for a
distribution of land; when they had entered, with their wives and
children, he had them all slaughtered. On his return to Rome he was
awarded a public triumph. 30 Shocked by the brutalities of empire, a
Sabine officer in the Roman army, Quintus Sertorius, went over to the
Spaniards, organized and drilled them, and led them to victory</p>
<p>CHAP.vn) THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION 137</p>
<p>after victory over the legions sent to subdue him. For eight years
(80-72) he ruled a rebel kingdom, winning the affection of the people by
his just administra- tion and by his establishment of schools for the
education of native youth. Metellus, the Roman general, offered a
hundred talents (60,000) and 20,000 acres of land to any Roman who
should kill him. Perpenna, a Roman refugee in Sertorius’ camp, invited
him to dinne r, assassinated him, and made himself master of the army
that Sertorius had trained. Pompey was sent against Perpenna and easily
defeated him; Perpenna was executed, and the exploitation of Spain was
resumed.</p>
<p>The next act of the revolution came not from the free but from the
slave. Lentulus Batiates kept at Capua a school of gladiators — slaves
or condemned criminals trained to fight animals, or one another, to the
death in public arenas or private homes. Two hundred of them tried to
escape; seventy-eight succeeded, armed themselves, occupied a slope of
Vesuvius, and raided the adjoining towns for food (73). As their leader
they chose a Thracian, Spartacus, “a man not only of high spirit and
bravery,” says Plutarch, “but also in understanding and gentleness
superior to his condition.” 31 He issued a call to the slaves of Italy
to rise in revolt; soon he had 70,000 men, hunger- ing for liberty and
revenge. He taught them to manufacture their own weapons, and to fight
with such order and discipline that for years they outmatched every
force sent to subdue them. His victories filled the rich men of Italy
with fear, and its slaves with hope; so many of these tried to join him
that after raising his army to 120,000 he refused further recruits,
finding it difficult to care for them. He marched his horde toward the
Alps, “intending, when he had passed them, that every man should go to
his own home.” 32 But his followers did not share these refined and
pacific sentiments; revolting against his leadership, they began to loot
the towns of northern Italy. The Senate now sent both consuls, with
heavy forces, against the rebels. One army met a detachment that had
seceded from Spartacus, and slaughtered it; the other attacked the main
rebel body, and was defeated. Moving again toward the Alps, Spartacus
encountered a third army, led by Cassius, and decimated it; but finding
his way blocked by still other legions, he turned south and marched
toward Rome.</p>
<p>Half the slaves of Italy were on the verge of insurrection, and in
the capi- tal no man could tell when the revolution would break out in
his very home. All that opulent society, which had enjoyed every luxury
slavery could produce, trembled at the thought of losing everything —
mastery, property, life. Senators and millionaires cried out for a
better general; few offered themselves, for all feared this strange new
foe. At last Crassus came forward and was given the command, with 40,000
men; and many of the nobility,</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>I 3 8</p>
<p>(chap, vn</p>
<p>not all forgetting the traditions of their class, joined him as
volunteers. Knowing that he had an empire against him, and that his men
coujd never administer either the Empire or the capital, Spartacus
passed Rome by and continued south to Thurii, marching the length of
Italy in the hope of trans- porting his men to Sicily or Africa. For a
third year he fought off all attacks. But again his impatient soldiers
rejected his authority and began to ravage the neighboring towns.
Crassus came upon a horde of these marauders and slew them, 1 2,300 in
number, every man fighting to the last. Meanwhile Pompey’s legions,
returning from Spain, were sent to swell the forces of Crassus.
Despairing of victory over such a multitude, Spartacus flung him- self
upon the army of Crassus and welcomed death by plunging into the midst
of the foe. Two centurions fell by his hand; struck down and unable to
rise, he continued the fight on his knees; at last he was so cut to
pieces that his body could not later be identified. The great majority
of his fol- lowers perished with him; some fled, and became hunted men
in the woods of Italy; 6000 captives were crucified along the Appian Way
from Capua to Rome (71). There their rotting bodies were left to hang
for months, so that all masters might take comfort, and all slaves take
heed.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>POMPEY</li>
</ol>
<p>When Crassus and Pompey returned from this campaign they did not, as
the Senate wished and law required, disband or disarm their troops at
the gates. Camping outside the walls, they asked permission to stand for
the consulate without entering the city — again a violation of
precedent; in addi- tion Pompey demanded land for his soldiers and a
triumph for himself. The Senate refused, hoping to play one general
against the other. But Crassus and Pompey joined hands, made a sudden
alliance with the populares and the business class, and by generous
bribery won election as consuls for 70 b.c. The magnates entered the
partnership for two immediate ends: to recapture power in the juries
that tried them, and to replace Lucullus — who had ruled the Roman East
with unprofitable integrity — by a man of their own class and views. In
Pompey they recognize^ their man,</p>
<p>Pompey was now thirty-five, and already the veteran of many
campaigns. Bom of a rich equestrian family, he had won universal
admiration by his courage and temperance, and his skill in every branch
of sport and war. He had cleared Sicily and Africa of Sulla’s enemies,
and by his victories and his pride had earned from the humorous dictator
the cognomen Magnus, the Great. He had achieved a triumph almost before
a beard. 33 He was so hand- some that the courtesan Flora declared she
could never part from him with-</p>
<p>THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION</p>
<p>chap, vn)</p>
<p>out a bite. 84 He was sensitive and shy, and blushed when he had to
address a public gathering, but in battle he was in these days
impetuously brave; in later life timidity and corpulence burdened his
generalship, and he hesitated till lost. His mind had neither brilliance
nor depth; his policies were made for him, not by him — first by the
politicians of the popular es, then by the Senatorial oligarchy. His
great wealth lifted him above the coarser tempta- tions of politics;
amid the selfishness and corruption of his time he shone by his
patriotism and his integrity; he seems to have sincerely sought the
public good as well as his own. His outstanding fault was vanity. His
early successes led him to overrate his abilities, and he wondered why
Rome waited so long to make him in everything but name a king.</p>
<p>The two favorites of Sulla, now consuls together, devoted themselves
to overthrowing the Sullan constitution. Pompey and Crassus paid their
debt to the populares by passing a bill that restored all the power of
the tribunes. They consolidated their alliance with business by
directing Lucullus to give the publicans full charge of tax collections
in the East; and they supported legislation that required juries to be
drawn equally from the Senate, the equestrian class, and the tribunes of
the Treasury. Crassus had to wait fifteen years for his reward — the
privilege of drinking gold in Asia; Pompey received his in 67, when the
Assembly voted him almost limitless authority to proceed against the
pirates of Cilicia. Once Rhodes had kept the Aegean free of such
marauders; but Rhodes, humiliated and impoverished by Rome and Delos,
could no longer maintain the fleet required for such a service; and the
landed aristocracy that controlled the Senate had no keen interest in
making the channels of maritime commerce secure. Merchants and plebs
felt the results more sharply: trade became almost impossible in the
Aegean, even in the central Mediterranean; and imports of grain fell so
rapidly that the price of wheat at Rome rose to twenty sesterces per
modius, or three dollars a peck. The pirates flaunted their success with
gilded masts, purple sails, and silver- plated oars on their thousand
ships; they took and held 400 coastal towns, plundered temples in
Samothrace, Samos, Epidaurus, Argos, Leucas, and Actium, kidnaped Roman
officials, and assailed even the shores of Apulia and Etruria.</p>
<p>To meet this situation Pompey’s friend Gabinius proposed a bill
giving him for three years absolute control of all Roman fleets, and all
persons within fifty miles of any Mediterranean shore. Every senator but
Caesar opposed this extraordinary measure, but the Assembly passed it
with enthusi- asm, voted Pompey an army of 1 25,000 men and a navy of
500 vessels, and ordered the Treasury to place 144,000,000 sesterces at
his disposal. In effect the bill deposed the Senate, ended the Sullan
restoration, and established a provisional monarchy as a prelude and
lesson to Caesar. The outcome</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>strengthened the precedent. The very day after Pompey’s appointment
the price of wheat began to fall. Within three months he accomplished
his task- captured the pirate ships, took their strongholds, executed
their leaders — and yet without abusing his unusual authority. Commerce
took heart and sailed again, and a river of cereals flowed into
Rome.</p>
<p>While Pompey was still in Cilicia, his friend Manilius offered the
Assem- bly a bill transferring to him full command of the armies and
provinces then (66) under Lucullus, and prolonging the powers conferred
upon him by the Gabinian Law. The Senate resisted, but the merchants and
moneylenders gave strong support to the proposal. Pompey, they hoped,
would be less lenient than Lucullus to their Asiatic debtors; he would
restore the tax col- lections to the publicans; he would conquer not
only Bithynia and Pontus, but Cappadocia, Syria, and Judea; and these
rich fields would be thrown open to Roman trade and finance under the
protection of Roman arms. A “new man,” Marcus Tullius Cicero, who had
been elected praetor for that year with the aid of the business class,
spoke “For the Manilian Law,” and attacked the Senatorial oligarchy with
a rash eloquence unheard in Rome since the Gracchi, and with a candor
shocking in a politician:</p>
<p>The whole system of credit and finance which is carried on here
at</p>
<p>Rome is inextricably bound up with the revenues of the Asiatic prov-
inces. If these revenues are destroyed, our system of credit will</p>
<p>crash. … If some lose their entire fortunes they will drag many</p>
<p>more down with them. Save the state from such a calamity. . . .</p>
<p>Prosecute with all your energies the war against Mithridates, by</p>
<p>which the glory of the Roman name, the safety of our allies, our</p>
<p>most valuable revenues, and the fortunes of innumerable citizens</p>
<p>will be effectively preserved. 35</p>
<p>The measure was readily passed by the Assembly. The plebs cared
little for the fortunes of the financiers; but it rejoiced in having
found, through the issuance of extraordinary powers to a general, a
means of annulling the Sullan legislation and deposing its ancient
enemy, the Senate. From that moment the days of the Republic were
numbered. The Roman revolution, helped by the oratory of its greatest
foe, had taken another step toward Caesar.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>CICERO AND CATILINE</li>
</ol>
<p>Plutarch thought that Marcus Tullius was called Cicero because of a
wart, shaped like a vetch ( cicer ), on an ancestor’s nose; more
probably his fore - bears had earned the cognomen by raising renowned
crops of chick-peas.</p>
<p>CHAP.Vn) THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION 141</p>
<p>In his Laws Cicero describes with engaging tenderness the modest
villa that had seen his birth near Arpinum, halfway between Rome and
Naples, in the foothills of the Apennines. His father was just rich
enough to give his son the best education that the age could provide. He
engaged the Greek poet Archias to tutor Marcus in literature and Greek
and then sent the youth to study law with Q. Mucius Scaevola, the
greatest jurist of his time. Cicero listened eagerly to the trials and
debates in the Forum, and rapidly learned the arts and tricks of
forensic speech. “To succeed in the law,” he said, “a man must renounce
all pleasures, avoid all amusements, say farewell to recrea- tion,
games, entertainment, almost to intercourse with his friends.” 80</p>
<p>Soon he was practicing law himself and making speeches whose
brilliance and courage won him the gratitude of the middle classes and
the plebs. He prosecuted a favorite of Sulla and denounced the
proscriptions in the midst of theSullan terror (80 b.c.). 87 Shortly
afterward, perhaps to avoid the dic- tator’s revenge, he went to Greece,
and continued there his studies of oratory and philosophy. After three
happy years in Athens he passed over to Rhodes, where he heard the
lectures of Apollonius, son of Molon, on rhetoric, and those of
Poseidonius on philosophy. From the first he learned the periodic
sentence structure and purity of speech that were to distinguish his
style; and from the other that mild Stoicism which he would later
expound in his essays on religion, government, friendship, and old
age.</p>
<p>Returning to Rome at the age of thirty, he married Terentia, whose
ample dowry now enabled him to go into politics. In 75 he distinguished
himself by his just administration of a quaestorship in Sicily. In 70,
having resumed the practice of law, he raised a furor among the
aristocracy by accepting a retainer from the cities of Sicily and
bringing suit against the senator Caius Verres, on the charge that as
propraetor there (73-7 1 ) Verres had sold his appointments and
decisions, had lowered individual tax assessments in inverse proportion
to bribes received, had despoiled Syracuse of nearly all its statu- ary,
had assigned the revenues of a whole city to his mistress, and all in
all had carried injustice, extortion, and robbery to such a pitch as to
leave the island more desolate than after two Servile Wars. Worse yet,
Verres had kept for himself some of the spoils that usually went to the
publicans. The business class supported Cicero in the indictment, while
Hortensius, aristo- cratic leader of the Roman bar, led the defense for
Verres. Cicero was al- lowed some hundred days to gather evidence in
Sicily; he took only fifty, but he presented so much damaging testimony
in his opening address that Hortensius — who had decorated his gardens
with part of Verres’ sculptural loot — abandoned his client. Condemned
to pay a fine of 40,000,000 sesterces, Verres fled into exile. Cicero
published the five additional speeches that he</p>
<p>142 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>had prepared; they constituted an unsparing attack upon Roman
malfeasance in the provinces. His energy and courage won him such
support that when he ran for the consulate for 63 b.c. he was elected by
acclamation.</p>
<p>Bom of modest equestrian rank, Cicero had naturally sided with the
middle class and had resented the pride, privileges, and misrule of the
aristocracy. But far more deeply he feared those radical leaders whose
program, he thought, threatened all property with mob rule. He therefore
made it his policy, now that he was in office, to promote a “concord of
the orders”— i.e., a co-operation of the aristocracy and the business
class — against the returning tide of revolt.</p>
<p>The causes and forces of discontent, however, were too deep and
varied to be easily dissolved. Many of the poor were listening to
preachers of utopia, and some who listened were ripe for violence. A
little above them were plebeians who had forfeited their property
through defaulted mort- gages. Some of Sulla’s veterans had failed to
make their land allotments pay and were ready for any disturbance that
might give them loot without toil. Among the upper classes were
insolvent debtors and ruined speculators who had lost all hope or wish
to meet their obligations. Others had political ambi- tions and saw
their road to advancement cluttered with conservatives who took too long
to die. A few revolutionists were sincere idealists, convinced that only
a complete overturn could mitigate the corruption and inequity of the
Roman state.</p>
<p>One man sought to unite these scattered groups into a coherent
political force. We know Lucius Sergius Catiline only through his
enemies — through the history of his movement by the millionaire
Sallust, and through the violent vituperation of Cicero’s orations
Against Catiline. Sallust describes him as a “guilt -stained soul at
odds with gods and men, who found no rest either waking or sleeping, so
cruelly did conscience ravage his overwrought mind. Hence his pallid
complexion, his bloodshot eyes, his gait now fast now slow; in short,
his face and every glance showed the madman.” 38 Such a description
suggests the pictures that a people struggling for life or power paints
of its enemies in war; when the battle is over the pictures are gradu-
ally revised, but in the case of Catiline we have no revision. In youth
he had been charged with deflowering a Vestal Virgin, a half sister of
Cicero’s first wife; the court had acquitted the Virgin, but gossip had
not acquitted Cati- line; on the contrary, it added that he had killed
his son to please his jealous mistress. 80 In the scale against these
stories we can only say that for four years after Catiline’s death the
common people of Rome— “the miserable, starveling rabble,” Cicero called
them— strewed flowers upon his tomb. 40 Sallust quotes what purports to
be one of his speeches:</p>
<p>THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION</p>
<p>*43</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>Ever since the state fell under the sway of a few powerful men . .
.</p>
<p>all influence, rank, and wealth have been in their hands. To us
they</p>
<p>have left danger, defeat, prosecutions, poverty. . . . What have
we</p>
<p>left save only the breath of life? … Is it not better to die
valiantly</p>
<p>than to lose our wretched and dishonored lives after being the sport
of other men’s insolence? 41</p>
<p>The program on which he proposed to unite the heterogeneous elements
of revolution was simple: novae tabulae — 11 new records”— i.e., a clean
sweep and abolition of all debts. He labored for this purpose with all
the energy of a Caesar; indeed, for a time he had the sympathy, if not
the secret support, of Caesar. “There was nothing,” said Cicero, “that
he could no t undergo, no pains that he would spare of co-operation,
vigilance, and toil. He could bear cold, hunger, and thirst.” 42 We are
assured by his enemies that he organized a band of 400 men who planned
to kill the consuls and seize the government on the first day of 65. The
day came, and nothing unusual transpired. At the end of 64 Catiline
stood against Cicero for the consulate and waged a vigor- ous campaign.*
Capital took fright and began to leave Italy. The upper classes united
in support of Cicero; for a year the Concordia ordimim that he had asked
for was a reality, and he was its perfect voice.</p>
<p>Blocked politically, Catiline turned to war. Secretly his followers
organ- ized an army of 20,000 men in Etruria, and gathered together in
Rome a group of conspirators that included representatives of every
class from senators to slaves, and two urban praetors — Cethegus and
Lentulus. In the following October Catiline again ran for the consulate.
To make sure of his election, conservative historians tell us, he
planned to have his rival mur- dered during the campaign, and to have
Cicero assassinated at the same time. Claiming that he had been apprised
of these plans, Cicero filled the Field of Mars with armed guards and
superintended the voting. Despite the enthusi- astic support of the
proletariat, Catiline was again defeated. On November 7, says Cicero,
several conspirators knocked at his door, but were driven away by his
guards. On the morrow, seeing Catiline in the Senate, Cicero flung at
him that superb excoriation which once every schoolboy mouthed. As the
oration proceeded, the seats around Catiline were emptied one by one,
until he sat alone. Silently he bore the torrent of accusations, the
sharp, relentless phrases falling like whips upon his head. Cicero
played upon every emotion; he spoke of the nation as the common father,
and of Catiline as in intent a parricide; he charged him — not with
evidence given, but by innuendo and</p>
<p>• It was in this campaign that Cicero’s brother Quintus drew up for
him a manual of electioneering technique. “Be lavish in your promises,”
Quintus advised; “men prefer a false promise to a flat refusal. . . .
Contrive to get some new scandal aired against your rivals for crime,
corruption, or immorality.” 48</p>
<p>J44 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. VII</p>
<p>implication — with conspiracy against the state, with theft,
adultery, and sexual abnormality; finally he petitioned Jove to protect
Rome, and to de- vote Catiline to eternal punishment. When Cicero had
finished, Catiline walked out unhindered, and joined his forces in
Etruria. His general, L. Manlius, sent a last appeal to the Senate:</p>
<p>We call gods and men to witness that it is not against our
country</p>
<p>that we have taken up arms, nor against the safety of our fellow</p>
<p>citizens. We, wretched paupers, who through the violence and</p>
<p>cruelty of usurers are without a country, condemned to scorn and</p>
<p>indigence, are actuated by only one wish: to guarantee our personal
security against wrong. We demand neither power nor wealth, those great
and external causes of strife among mankind. We only ask for</p>
<p>freedom, a treasure that no man will surrender except with life
itself.</p>
<p>We implore you, senators, have pity on your miserable fellow</p>
<p>citizens! 44</p>
<p>The next day, in a se cond oration, Cicero described the rebel’s
following as centering around a coterie of perfumed perverts, and
indulged without stint his genius for sarcasm and invective, ending
again on a religious note. In the following weeks he presented evidence
to the Senate purporting to show that Catiline had tried to stir up
revolution in Gaul. On December 3 he had Lentulus, Cethegus, and five
other adherents of Catiline arrested. In a third oration he declared
their guilt, announced their imprisonment, and told the Senate and the
people that the conspiracy was broken and that they might retire to
their homes in security and peace. On December 5 he con- voked the
Senate and asked what should be done with the prisoners. Silanus voted
that they should be executed. Caesar advised mere imprisonment,
recalling that the execution of a Roman citizen was forbidden by the
Sem- pronian Law. In a fourth oration Cicero gently advised death. Cato
gave the opinion the sanction of his philosophy, and death won the day.
Some young aristocrats tried to kill Caesar as he left the senate
chamber, but he escaped. Cicero, with armed men, went to the jail and
had the sentence carried out with a minimum of delay. Marcus Antonius,
co-consul with Cicero, and father of a famous son, was sent north with
an army to destroy Catiline’s force. The Senate promised pardon and
200,000 sesterces to every man who would leave the rebel ranks; but,
says Sallust, “not one deserted from Catiline’s camp.” On the plains of
Pistoia battle was joined (61). The 3000 insurgents, far outnumbered,
fought to the end around their treasured standards, the eagles of
Marius. None surrendered or took flight; every one of them died on the
field, among them Catiline.</p>
<p>Being essentially a man of thought rather than of action, Cicero was
sur-</p>
<p>THE OLIGARCHIC REACTION</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>H5</p>
<p>prised and impressed by the skill and courage he had shown in
suppressing a dangerous revolt. “The direction of so great an
enterprise,” he told the Senate, “seems scarcely possible to merely
human wisdom.” 45 He com - pared himself with Romulus, but considered it
a greater deed to have pre- served Rome than to have founded it. 46
Senators and magnates smiled at his language, but they knew that he had
saved them. Cato and Catulus hailed him as pater patriae, father of his
country. When, at the end of 63, he laid down his office, all the
propertied classes in the community, he tells us, gave him thanks, named
him immortal, and escorted him in honor to his home. 47 The proletariat
did not join in these demonstrations. It could not forgive him for
violating the laws of Rome by putting citizens to death without appeal;
it felt that he had made no effort to remove the causes of Catiline’s
revolt, or to mitigate the poverty of the masses. It refused to let him
address the Assembly on that last day, and listened in anger when he
swore that he had preserved the city. The revolution was not over. With
Caesar’s consulate it would begin again.</p>
