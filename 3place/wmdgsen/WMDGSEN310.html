<h4 id="chapter-xxvii">CHAPTER XXVII</h4>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church</p>
<p>1095-1294</p>
<p>I. THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>I N many aspects religion is the most interesting of man’s ways, for
it is his ultimate commentary on life and his only defense against
death. Nothing is more moving, in medieval history, than the
omnipresence, almost at times the omnipotence, of religion. It is
difficult for those who today live in com- fort and plenty to go down in
spirit into the chaos and penury that molded medieval faiths. But we
must think of the superstitions, apocalypses, idola- try, and credulity
of medieval Christians, Moslems, and Jews with the same sympathy with
which we should think of their hardships, their poverty, and their
griefs. The flight of thousands of men and women fro m “the world, the
flesh, and the Devil” into monasteries and nunneries suggests not so
much their cowardice as the extreme disorder, insecurity, and violence
of medieval life. It seemed obvious that the savage impulses of men
could be controlled only by a supernaturally sanctioned moral code.
Then, above all, the world needed a creed that would balance tribulation
with hope, soften bereave- ment with solace, redeem the prose of toil
with the poetry of belief, cancel life’s brevity with continuance, a nd
give an inspiring and ennobling signifi- cance to a cosmic drama that
might else be a meaningless and intolerable pro- cession of souls,
species, and stars stumbling one by one into an inescapable
extinction.</p>
<p>Christianity sought to meet these needs with a tremendous and epic
con- ception of creation and human sin, of the Virgin Mother and the
suffering God, of the immortal soul destined to face a Last Judgment, to
be damned to everlasting hell, or to be saved for eternal bliss by a
Church adminis- tering through her sacraments the divine grace earned by
the Redeemer’s death. It was within this encompassing vision that most
Christian lives moved and found their meaning. The greatest gift of
medieval faith was the uphold- ing confidence that right would win in
the end, and that every seeming vic- tory of evil would at last be
sublimated in the universal triumph of the good.</p>
<p>The Last Judgment was the pivot of the Christian, as of the Jewish
and the Moslem, faith. The belief in the Second Advent of Christ, and
the end of the world, as preludes to the Judgment, had survived the
disappointments of the apostles, the passing of the year 1000, and the
fears and hopes of forty</p>
<p>732</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 733</p>
<p>generations; it ha d become less vivid and general, but it had not
died; “wise men,” said Roger Bacon in 1 27 1 , considered the end of the
world to be near. 1</p>
<p>Men hoped vaguely for heaven, but vividly feared hell. There was much
tenderness in medieval Christianity, probably more than in any other
reli- gion in history, but the Catholic, like the early Protestant,
theology and preaching, felt called upon to stress the terror of hell.t
Christ was to this age no “gentle Jesus meek and mild,” but the stern
aveng er of every mortal sin. Nearly all churches showed some
representation of Christ the Judge; many had pictures of the Last
Judgment, and these portrayed the tortures of the damned more
prominently than the bliss of the saved. St. Methodius, we are told,
converted King Boris of Bulgaria by painting a picture of hell on the
wall of the royal palace. 4 Many mystics claimed to have had visions of
hell, and described its geography and terror. 5 The monk Tundale, in the
twelfth century, reported exquisite details. In the center of hell, he
said, the Devil was bound to a burning gridiron by red-hot chains; his
screams of agony never ended; his hands were free, and reached out and
seized the damned; his teeth crushed them like grapes; his fiery breath
drew them down his burning throat. Assistant demons with hooks of iron
plunged the bodies of the damned alternately into fire or icy water, or
hung them up by the tongue, or sliced them with a saw, or beat them flat
on an anvil, or boiled them or strained them through a cloth. Sulphur
was mixed with the fire in order that a vile stench might be added to
the discomforts of the damned; but the fire gave no light, so that a
horrible darkness shrouded the incalcu- lable diversity of pains. 6 The
Church herself gave no official location or de- scription of hell; but
she frowned upon men who, like Origen, doubted the reality of its
material fires. 7 The purpose of the doctrine would have been frustrated
by its mitigation. St. Thomas Aquinas held that “the fir e which will
torment the bodies of the damned is corporeal,” and located hell in “the
lowest part of the earth.” 8</p>
<p>To common medieval imagination, and to such men as Gregory the Great,
the Devil was no figure of speech but a life and blood reality, prowling
about everywhere, suggesting temptations and creating all kinds of evil;
he could usually be sent packing by a dash of holy water or the sign of
the cross; but he left an awful odor of burning sulphur behind him. He
was a great ad-</p>
<ul>
<li>The early Christian theory that all judgment of the dead would be
postponed till the “doomsday” of the end of the world had been replaced
by the doctrine that every person would be judged immediately after his
death. 2</li>
</ul>
<p>t Cf. General William Booth (1829-1912) on the methods of his
Salvation Army preachers: “Nothing moves the people like the terrific.
They must have hell -fire flashed before their faces, or they will not
move.” 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>734</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>mirer of women, used their smiles and charms as bait to lure his
victims, and occasionally won their favors — if the ladies themselves
might be believed. So a woman of Toulouse admitted that she had
frequently slept with Satan, and had, at the age of fifty-three, given
birth, through his services, to a monster with a wolf’s head and a
serpent’s tail. 9 The Devil had an immense cohort of assistant demons,
who hovered around every soul and persistently maneuvered to lead it
into sin. They, too, liked to lie as “incubi” with care - less or lo
nely or holy women. 10 The monk Richalm described them as “filling the
whole world; the whole air is but a thick mass of devils, always and
everywhere in wait for us … it is marvelous that any one of us should be
alive; were it not for God’s grace, no one of us could escape.” 11
Practically everybody, including the philosophers, believed in this
multitude of demons; but a saving sense of humor tempered this
demonology, and most healthy males looked upon the little devils rather
as poltergeist mischief-makers than as objects of terror. Such demons,
it was believed, intruded audibly but in- visibly into conversations,
cut holes in people’s garments, and threw dirt at passersby. One tired
demon sat on a head of lettuce, and was inadvertently eaten by a nun.
12</p>
<p>More alarming was the doctrine that “many are called but few are
chosen” (Matt, xxii, 14). Orthodox theologians — Mohammedan as well as
Christian — held that the vast majority of the human race would go to
hell. 13 Most Christian theologians took literally the statement
ascribed to Christ: “He that</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 735</p>
<p>very many fail.” 22 Volcanoes were supposed by many to be the mouths
of hell; their rumbling was a faint echo of the moans of the damned; 23
and Gregory the Great argued that the crater of Etna was daily widening
to receive the enormous number of souls that were fated to be damned. 24
The congested bowels of the earth held in their hot embrace the great
majority of all the human beings that had ever been born. From that hell
there would be no respite nor escape through all eternity. Said
Berthold: Count the sands of the seashore, or the hairs that have grown
on man or beast since Adam; reckon a year of torment for each grain or
hair, and that span of time would hardly represent the beginning of the
agony of the condemned. 25 The last moment of a man’s life was decisive
for all eternity; and the fear that that</p>
<p>These terrors were in some careful measure mitigated by the doctrine
of purgatory. Prayers for the dead were a custom as old as the Church;
pen- ances undergone, and Masses said, to aid the dead, can be traced as
far back as 250. 20 Augustine had discussed the possibility of a place
of purging pun- ishment for sins forgiven but not fully atoned for
before death. Gregory I had approved the idea, and had suggested that
the pains of souls in purgatory might be shortened and softened by the
prayers of their living friends. 27 The theory did not fully capture
popular belief till Peter Damian, about 1070, gave it the afflatus of
his fevered eloquence. In the twelfth century it was advanced by the
spread of a legend that St. Patrick, to convince some doubters, had
allowed a pit to be dug in Ireland, into which several monks descended;
some returned, said the tale, and described purgatory and hell with
discouraging vividness. The Irish knight Owen claimed to have gone down
through that pit into hell in 1153; and his account of his nether
experiences had a prodigious success. 28 Tourists came from afar to
visit this pit; financial abuses developed; and Pope Alexander VI, in
1497, ordered it closed as an imposture. 29</p>
<p>What proportion of the people in medieval Christendom accepted the
doctrines of Christianity? We hear of many heretics, but most of these
ad- mitted the basic tenets of the Christian creed. At Orleans in 1017
two men, “among the worthiest in lineage and learning,” denied creation,
the Trinity, heaven, and hell as “mere ravings.” 30 John of Salisbury,
in the twelfth cen - tury, tells of hearing many persons talk “otherwise
than faith may hold”; 31 in that century, says Villani, there were at
Florence epicureans who scoffed at God and the saints, and lived
“according to the flesh.” 32 Giraldus Cam - brensis (1 146?-! 220) tells
of an unnamed priest who, reproved by another for careless celebration
of the Mass, asked whether his critic really believed in
transubstantiation, the Incarnation, the Virgin Birth, and resurrection-
adding that all this had been invented by cunning ancients to hold men
in terror and restraint, and was now carried on by hypocrites. 33 The
same Ger-</p>
<p>73&lt;5 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>aid of Wales quotes the scholar Simon of Tournai (c. 1201) as crying
out, one day, “Almighty God! how long will this superstitious sect of
Christians, and this upstart invention endure?” 34 Of this Simon the
story is told that in a lecture he proved by ingenious arguments the
doctrine of the Trinity, and then, elated by the applause of his
audience, boasted that he could disprove the doctrine with yet stronger
arguments; whereupon, we are told, he was immediately stricken with
paralysis and idiocy. 35 About 1 200 Peter, Prior of Holy Trinity in
Aldgate, London, wrote: “There are some who believe that there is no
God, and that the world is ruled by chance. . . . There are many who
believe neither in good or evil angels, nor in life after death, nor in
any other spiritual and invisible thing.” 36 Vincent of Beauvais ( 1
200? -64) mourned that many “derided visions and stories” (of the
saints) “as vulgar fables or lying inventions,” and added, “We need not
wonder if such tales get no credence f rom men who believe not in hell.”
37</p>
<p>The doctrine of hell stuck in many throats. Some simple souls asked
“why God had created the Devil if He foresaw Satan’s sin and fall?” 38
Skeptics argued that God could not be so cruel as to punish finite sin
with infinite pain; to which the theologians answered that a mortal sin
was an offense against God, and therefore involved infinite guilt. A
weaver of Toulouse, in 1247, remained unconvinced. “If,” he said, “I
could lay hold on that god who, out of a thousand men whom he has made,
saves one and damns all the rest, I would tear and rend him tooth and
nail as a traitor, and would spit in his face.” 39 Other skeptics argued
more genially that hell -fire must in time calcine the soul and body to
insensitivity, so that “he who is used to hell is as comfortable there
as anywhere else.” 40 The old joke about hell having more interesting
company than heaven appears in the French idyl of Aucassin et Nicolette
(c. 1230). 41 Priests complained that most people put off thought of
hell to their deathbed, confident that however sinful their lives,
“three words” (ego te absolvo) “will save me.” 42</p>
<p>Apparently there were village atheists then as now. But village
atheists leave few memorials behind them; and the literature that has
come down from the Middle Ages was largely composed by churchmen, or was
largely screened by ecclesiastical selection. We shall find “wandering
scholars” composing irreverent poetry, rough burghers swearing the most
blasphe- mous oaths; people sleeping and snoring, 43 even dancing 44 and
whoring, 45 in church; and “more lechery, gluttony, murder, and robbery
in the Sunday” (said a friar) “than reigned all the week before.” 40
Such items, suggesting a lack of real faith, might be multiplied by
heaping up instances from a hundred countries and a thousand years on
one page; they serve to warn us against exaggerating medieval piety; but
the Middle Ages still convey to the student a pervasive atmosphere of
religious practices and beliefs. Every European state took Christianity
under its protection, and enforced submis- sion to the Church by law.
Nearly every king loaded the Church with gifts.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 737</p>
<p>Nearly every event in history was interpreted in religious terms.
Every incident in the Old Testament prefigured something in the New; in
vetere testamento , said Augustine, novum latet, in novo vetus patet ;
e.g., said the great Bishop, David watching Bathsheba bathing symbolized
Christ be- holding His Church cleansing herself from the pollution of
the world. 47 Everything natural was a supernatural sign. Every part of
a church, said Guillaume Durand ( 1 237? — 96), Bishop of Mende, has a
religious meaning: the portal is Christ, through whom We enter heaven;
the pillars are the bish- ops and doctors who uphold the Church; the
sacristy, where the priest puts on his vestments, is the womb of Mary,
where Christ put on human flesh. 48 Every beast, to this mood, had a
theological significance. “Whe n a lioness gives birth to a cub,” says a
typical medieval bestiary, “she brings it forth dead, and watches over
it three days, until the father, coming on the third day, breathes upon
its face and brings it to life. So the Father Almighty raised His S on
Our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.” 49</p>
<p>The people welcomed, and for the most part generated, a hundred thou-
sand tales of supernatural events, powers, and cures. An English urchin
tried to steal some pigeon fledglings from a nest; his hand miraculously
adhered to the stone upon which he leaned; only three days of prayer by
the com- munity released him. 50 A child offered bread to the sculptured
Infant of a Nativity shrine; the Christ Babe thanked it, and invited it
to paradise; three days late r the child died. 51 A “certain lecherous
priest wooed a woman. Un - able to win her consent, he kept the most
pure Body of the Lord in his mouth after Mass, hoping that if he thus
kissed her she would be bent to his desire by the force of the
Sacrament. . . . But when he would fain have gone forth from the church
he seemed to himself to grow so huge that he struck his head against the
ceiling.” He buried the wafer in a corner of the church; later he
confessed to another priest; they dug up the wafer, and found it had
turned into the blood-stained figure of a crucified man. 52 A woman kept
the sacred wafer in her mouth from church to home, and placed it in a
hive to reduce mortality among the bees; these built “for their most
sweet Guest, out of their sweetest honeycombs, a tiny chapel of
marvelous workman- ship.” 53 Pope Gregory I filled his works with
stories of this kind. Perhaps the people, or the literate among them,
took such tales with a grain of salt, or as pleasant fiction no worse
than the wondrous narratives wherewith our presidents and kings relax
their burdened brains; credulity may have changed its field rather than
its scope. There is a touching faith in many of these medieval legends:
so, when the beloved Pope Leo IX returned to Italy from his tour of
reform in France and Germany, the river Aniene divided like the Red Sea
to let him pass. 54</p>
<p>The power of Christianity lay in its offering to the people faith
rather than knowledge, art rather than science, beauty rather than
truth. Men preferred it so. They suspected that no one could answer
their questions; it was pru-</p>
<p>738 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>dent, they felt, to take on faith the replies given with such
quieting authori- tativeness by the Church; they would have lost
confidence in her had she ever admitted her fallibility. Perhaps they
distrusted knowledge as the bitter fruit of a wisely forbidden tree, a
mirage that would lure man from the Eden of simplicity and an undoubting
life. So the medieval mind, for the most part, surrendered itself to
faith, trusted in God and the Church, as mod- ern man trusts in science
and the state. “You cannot perish,” said Philip Augustus to his sailors
in a midnight storm, “for at this moment thousands of monks are rising
from their beds, and will soon be praying for us.” 55 Men believed that
they were in the hands of a power greater than any human knowledge could
give. In Christendom, as in Islam, they surrendered to God; and even
amid profanity, violence, and lechery, they sought Him and sal- vation.
It was a God-intoxicated age.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SACRAMENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Next to the determination of the faith, the greatest power of the
Church lay in the administration of the sacraments — ceremonies
symbolizing the con- ferment of divin e grace. “In no religion,” said
St. Augustine, “can men be held together unless they are united in some
sort of fellowship through visi- ble symbols or sacraments.” 68
Sacramentum was applied in the fourth cen - tury to almost anything
sacred — to baptism, the cross, prayer; in the fifth century Augustine
applied it to the celebration of Easter; in the seventh cen- tury
Isidore of Seville restricted it to baptism, confirmation, and the
Eucha- rist. In the twelfth century the sacraments were finally fixed at
seven: baptism, confirmation, penance, the Eucharist, matrimony, holy
orders, and extreme unction. Minor ceremonies conferring divine grace —
like sprinkling with holy water, or the sign of the cross — were
distinguished as “sacra - mentals.”</p>
<p>The most vital sacrament was baptism. It had two functions: to remove
the stain of original sin, and, by this new birth, to formally receive
the in- dividual into the Christian fold. At this ceremony the parents
were expected to give the child the name of a saint who was to be its
patron, model, and protector; this was its “Christian name.” By the
ninth century the early Christian method of baptism by total immersion
had been gradually replaced by aspersion — sprinkling — as less
dangerous to health in northern climes. Any priest — or, in emergency,
any Christian — could confer baptism. The old cus- tom of deferring
baptism to the later years of life had now been replaced by infant
baptism. In some congregations, especially in Italy, a special chapel,
the baptistery, was constructed for this sacrament.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Church the sacraments of confirmation and Eucharist
were conferred immediately after baptism; in the Western Church the age
of con-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 739</p>
<p>firmation was gradually postponed to the seventh year, in order that
the child might learn the essentials of the Christian faith. It was
administered only by a bishop, with a “laying on of hands,” a prayer
that the Holy Ghost would enter the candidate, an anointing of the
forehead with chrism, and a slight blow on the cheek; so, as in the
dubbing of a knight, the young Chris- tian was confirmed in his faith,
and was sworn by implication into all the rights and duties of a
Christian.</p>
<p>More important was the sacrament of penance. If the doctrines of the
Church inculcated a sense of sin, she offered means of periodically
cleansing the soul by confessing one’s sins to a priest and performing
the assigned pen - ances. According to the Gospel (Matt.xvi, i9;xviii, 1
8) , Christ had forgiven sins, and had endowed the apostles with a
similar power to “bind and loose.” This power, said the Church, had
descended by apostolic succession from the apostles to the early
bishops, from Peter to the popes; and in the twelfth century the “power
of the keys” was extended by bishops to the priests. The public
confession practiced in primitive Christianity had been replaced in the
fourth century by private confession, to spare embarrassment to digni-
taries, but public confession survived in some heretical sects, and a
public penance might be imposed for such monstrous crimes as the
massacre of Thessalonica or the murder of Becket. The Fourth Council of
the Lateran (1215) made annual confession and communion a solemn
obligation, whose neglect was to exclude the offender from church
services and Christian burial. To encourage and protect the penitent a
“seal” was placed upon every private confession: no priest was allowed
to reveal what had been so con- fessed. From the eighth century onward
“Penitentials” were published, pre - scribing canonical
(ecclesiastically authorized) penances for each sin- prayers, fasts,
pilgrimage, almsgiving, or other works of piety or charity.</p>
<p>“This wondrous institution,” as Leibniz called the sacrament of
penance, 57 had many good effects. It gave the penitent relief from
secret and neurotic broodings of remorse; it allowed the priest to
improve by counsel and warn- ings the moral and physical health of his
flock; it comforted the sinner with the hope of reform; it served, said
the skeptical Voltaire, as a restraint upon crime; 58 “auricular
confession,” said Goethe, “should never have been taken</p>

<p>An indulgence was not a license to commit sin, but a partial or
plenary exemption, granted by the Church, from some or all of the
purgatorial pun- ishment merited by earthly sin. Absolution in
confession removed from sin the guilt that would have condemned the
sinner to hell, but it did not absolve him from the “temporal”
punishment due to his sin. Only a small minority of Christians
completely atoned on earth for their sins; the balance of atone- ment
would be exacted in purgatory. The Church claimed the right to remit
such punishments by transmitting to any Christian penitent who performed
stipulated works of piety or charity a fraction of the rich treasury of
grace earned by Christ’s sufferings and death, and by saints whose
merits out - weighed their sins. Indulgences had been granted as far
back as the ninth century; some were given in the eleventh century to
pilgrims visiting sacred shrines; the first plenary indulgence was that
which Urban II offered in 1095 to those who would join the First
Crusade. From these uses the custom arose of giving indulgences for
repeating certain prayers, attending special re- ligious services,
building bridges, roads, churches, or hospitals, clearing for- ests or
draining swamps, contributing to a crusade, to an ecclesiastical
institution, to a Church jubilee, to a Christian war. . . . The system
was put to many good uses, but it opened doors to human cupidity. The
Church commissioned certain ecclesiastics, usually friars, as
quaestiarii to raise funds by offering indulgences in return for gifts,
repentance, and prayer. These solicitors — whom the English called
“pardoners”— developed a competitive zeal that scandalized many
Christians; they exhibited real or false relics to stimulate
contributions; and they kept for themselves a due or undue part of their
receipts. The Church made several efforts to reduce these abuses. The
Fourth Lateran Council ordered bishops to warn the faithful against
false relics and forged credentials; it ended the right of abbots, and
limited that of bishops, to issue indulgences; and it called upon all
ecclesiastics to exercise moderation in their zeal for the new device.
In 1261 the Council of Mainz denounced many quaestiarii as wicked liars,
who displayed the stray bones of men or beasts as those of saints,
trained themselves to weep on order, and offered purgatorial bargains
for a maximum of coin and a minimum of prayer. 62 Similar condemnations
were issued by church councils at Vienne ( 1 3 1 1 ) and Ravenna (1317)
, 63 The abuses continued.</p>
<p>Next to baptism the most vital sacrament was the Eucharist, or Holy
Com- munion. The Church took literally the words ascribed to Christ at
the Last Supper: of the bread, “this is my body”; and of the wine, “this
is my blood.” The main feature of the Mass was the “transubstantiation”
of wafers of bread and a chalice of wine into the body and blood of
Christ by the miraculous power of the priest; and the original purpose
of the Mass was to allow the faithful to partake of the “body and blood,
soul and divinity,” of the Second Person of the Triune God by eating the
consecrated Host and drinking the consecrated wine. As the drinking of
the transubstantiated wine risked spill-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 74I</p>
<p>ing the blood of Christ, the custom arose in the twelfth century of
com- municating through taking only the Host; and when some
conservatives (whose views were later adopted by the Hussites of
Bohemia) demanded communion in both forms to make sure that they
received the blood as well as the body of the Lord, theologians
explained that the blood of Christ was “concomitant” with His body in
the bread, and His body was “concomi - tant” with His blood in the wine.
64 A thousand marvels were told of the power of the consecrated Host to
cast out devils, cure disease, stop fires, and detect perjury by choking
liars. 65 Every Christian was required to communi- cate at least once a
year; and the First Communion of the young Christian was made an
occasion of solemn pageantry and happy celebration.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Real Presence developed slowly; its first
official for- mulation was by the Council of Nicaea in 787. In 855 a
French Benedictine monk, Ratramnus, taught that the consecrated bread
and wine were only spiritually, not carnally, the body and blood of
Christ. About 1045 Berengar, Archdeacon of Tours, questioned the reality
of transubstantiation; he was excommunicated; and Lanfranc, Abbot of
Bee, wrote a reply to him (1063), stating the orthodox doctrine:</p>
<p>We believe that the earthly substance … is, by the ineffable, in-</p>
<p>comprehensible . . . operation of heavenly power, converted into the
essence of the Lord’s body, while the appearance, and certain other</p>
<p>believers should receive the fuller rewards of faith. Yet at the
same</p>
<p>time the same body of the Lord is in heaven . . . inviolate, entire,
with- out contamination or injury. 66</p>
<p>The doctrine was proclaimed as an essential dogma of the Church by
the Lateran Council of 1215; and the Council of Trent in 1 560 added
that every particle of the consecrated wafer, no matter how broken,
contains the whole body, blood, and soul of Jesus Christ. Thus one of
the oldest ceremonies of primitive religion — the eating of the god — is
widely practiced and revered in European and American civilization
today.</p>
<p>By making matrimony a sacrament, a sacred vow, the Church immensely
raised the dignity and permanence of the marriage bond. In the sacrament
of holy orders the bishop conferred upon the new priest some of the
spiritual powers inherited from the apostles and presumably given to
these by God Himself in the person of Christ. And in the final sacrament
— extreme unction — the priest heard the confession of the dying
Christian, gave him the abso- lution that saved him from hell, and
anointed his members so that they might be cleansed of sin and fit for
resurrection before his Judge. His survivors gave him Christian burial
instead of pagan cremation, because the Church held that the body too
would rise from the dead. They wrapped him in his</p>
<p>742 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>shroud, placed a coin in his coffin as if for Charon’s ferriage, 66a
and bore him to his grave with solemn and costly ceremony. Mourners
might be hired to weep and wail; the relatives put on black garments for
a year; and no one could tell, from grief so long sustained, that a
contrite heart and a minister- ing priest had won for the departed the
pledge of paradise.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PRAYER</li>
</ol>
<p>In every great religion ritual is as necessary as creed. It
instructs, nourishes, and often begets, belief; it brings the believer
into comforting contact with his god; it charms the senses and the soul
with drama, poetry, and art; it binds individuals into fellowship and a
community by persuading them to share in the same rites, the same songs,
the same prayers, at last the same thoughts.</p>
<p>The oldest Christian prayers were the Pater noster and the Credo;
toward the end of the twelfth century the tender and intimate Ave Maria
began to take form; and there were poetic litanies of praise and
supplication. Some medieval prayers verged on magic incantations to
elicit miracles; some ran to an importunate iteratio n that desperately
overruled Christ’s ban on “vain repetitions.” 67 Monks and nuns, and
later the laity, from an Oriental custom brought in by Crusaders , 68
gradually developed the rosary. As this was made popular by Dominican
monks, so the Franciscans popularized the Via Cru- cis, or Way or
Stations of the Cross, by which the worshiper recited prayers before
each of fourteen pictures or tableaux representing stages in the Pas-
sion of Christ. Priests, monks, nuns, and some laymen sang or recited
the “canonical hours”— prayers, readings, psalms, and hymns formulated
by Benedict and others, and gathered into a breviarium by Alcuin and
Gregory VII. Every day and night, at intervals of some three hours, and
from a mil- lion chapels and hearths, these conspiring prayers besieged
the sky. Pleasant must have been their music to homes within their
hearing; dulcis cantilena divini cidtus , said Ordericus .Vitalis, quae
corda fidelium mitigat ac laetificat —“sweet is the song of the divine
worship, which comforts the hearts of the faithful, and makes them
glad.” 69</p>
<p>The official prayers of the Church were often addressed to God
the</p>
<p>Father; a few appealed to the Holy Ghost; but the prayers of the
people were addressed mostly to Jesus, Mary, and the saints. The
Almighty was feared; He still carried, in popular conception, much of
the severity that had come down from Yahveh; how could a simple sinner
dare to take his prayer to so awful and distant a throne? Jesus was
closer, but He too was God, and one hardly ventured to speak to Him face
to face after so thoroughly ignoring His Beatitudes. It seemed wiser to
lay one’s prayer before a saint certified by canonization to be in
heaven, and to beg his or her intercession with Christ. All the poetic
and popular polytheism of antiquity rose from the never dead</p>

<p>past, and filled Christian worship with a heartening communion of
spirits, a brotherly nearness of earth to heaven, redeeming the faith of
its darker elements. Every nation, city, abbey, church, craft, soul, and
crisis of life had its patron saint, as in pagan Rome it had had a god.
England had St. George, France had St. Denis. St. Bartholomew was the
protector of the tanners be- cause he had been flayed alive; St. John
was invoked by candlemakers be- cause he had been plunged into a caldron
of burning oil; St. Christopher was the patron of porters because he had
carried Christ on his shoulders; Mary Magdalen received the petitions of
perfumers because she had poured aro- matic oils upon the Saviour’s
feet. For every emergency or ill men had a friend in the skies.
St. Sebastian and St. Roch were mighty in time of pesti- lence.
St. Apollinia, whose jaw had been broken by the executioner, healed the
toothache; St. Blaise cured sore throat. St. Corneille protected oxen,
St. Gall chickens, St. Anthony pigs. St. Medard was for France the saint
most frequently solicited for rain; if he failed to pour, his impatient
worshipers, now and then, threw his statue into the water, perhaps as
suggestive magic. 70</p>
<p>The Church arranged an ecclesiastical calendar in which every day
cele- brated a saint; but the year did not find room for the 25,000
saints that had been canonized by the tenth century. The calendar of
saints was so familiar to the people that the almanac divided the
agricultural year by their names. In France the feast of St. George was
the day for sowing. In England St. Valentine’s Day marked the winter’s
end; on that happy day birds (they said) coupled fervently in the woods,
and youths put flowers on the window sills of the girls they loved. Many
saints received canonization through the insistent worship of their
memory by the people or the locality, sometimes against ecclesiastical
resistance. Images of the saints were set up in churches and public
squares, on buildings and roads, and received a spontaneous wor- ship
that scandalized some philosophers and Iconoclasts. Bishop Claudius of
Turin complained that many folk “worship imag es of saints; . . . they
have not abandoned idols, but only changed their names.” 71 In this
matter, at</p>
<p>With so many saints there had to be many relics — their bones, hair,
cloth- ing, and anything that they had used. Every altar was expected to
cover one or more such sacred memorials. The basilica of St. Peter
boasted the bodies of Peter and Paul, which made Rome the chief goal of
European pilgrimage. A church in St. Omer claimed to have bits of the
True Cross, of the lance that had pierced Christ, of His cradle and His
tomb, of the manna that had rained from heaven, of Aaron’s rod, of the
altar on which St. Peter had said Mass, of the hair, cowl, hair shirt,
and tonsure shavings of Thomas a Becket, and of the original stone
tablets upon which the Ten Commandments had been traced by the very
finger of God. 72 The cathedral of Amiens en- shrined the head of
St. John the Baptist in a silver cup. 73 The abbey of St. Denis housed
the crown of thorns and the body of Dionysius the Areop-</p>

that they held the one authentic relic of Christ’s circumcision. 75

<p>It is to the credit of the secular clergy, and of most monasteries,
that while fully accepting the miraculous efficacy of genuine saintly
relics, they dis- countenanced, and often denounced, the excesses of
this popular fetishism. Some monks, seeking privacy for their devotions,
resented the miracles wrought by their relics; at Grammont the abbot
appealed to the remains of St. Stephen to stop his wonder-working, which
was luring noisy crowds; “otherwise,” he threatened, “we will throw your
bones into the river.” 82 It was the people, not the Church, that took
the lead in creating or swelling the legends of relic miracles; and the
Church in many cases warned the public to discredit the tales. 83 In 386
an imperial decree presumably requested by the Church forbade the
“carrying about or sale of” the remains of “martyrs”; St. Augustine
complained of “hypocrites in the garb of monks” who “trade</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVir) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 745</p>
<p>of 386. 84 About 1 1 19 Abbot Guibert of Nogent wrote a treatise On
the Relics of Saints , calling a halt to the relic craze. Many of the
relics , he says, are of “saints celebrated in worthless records”; some
“abbots, enticed by the multitude of gifts brought in, suffered the
fabrication of false miracles.” “Old wives and herds of base wenches
chant the lying legends of patron saints at their looms . . . and if a
man refute their words they will attack him . . . with their distaffs.”
The clergy, he notes, have rarely the heart or courage to protest; and
he confesses that he too held his peace when relic-mongers offered to
eager believers “so me of that very bread which Our Lord pressed with
His own teeth”; for “I should rightly be condemned for a madman if I
should dispute with madmen.” 85 He observes that several churches have
complete heads of St. John the Baptist, and marvels at the hydra heads
of that undecapitable saint. 86 Pope Alexander III (1179) forbade
monasteries to carry their relics about seeking contributions; the
Lateran Council of 1215 prohibited the display of relics outside their
shrines; 87 and the Second Coun- cil of Lyons ( 1 274) condemned the
“debasement” of relics and images. 88 In general the Church did not so
much encourage superstitions as inherit them from the imagination of the
people or the traditions of the Mediterra- nean world. The belief in
miracle-working objects, talismans, amulets, and formulas was as dear to
Islam as to Christianity, and both religions had re- ceived these
beliefs from pagan antiquity. Ancient forms of phallic worship lingered
far into the Middle Ages, but were gradually abolished by the Church. 89
The worship of God as Lord of Hosts and King of Kings inherited Semitic
and Roman ways of approach, veneration, and address; the incense burnt
before altar or clergy recalled the old burnt offerings; aspersion with
holy water was an ancient form of exorcism; processions and lustrations
con- tinued immemorial rites; the vestments of the clergy and the papal
title of pontifex maximus were legacies from pagan Rome. The Church
found that rural converts still revered certain springs, wells, trees,
and stones; she thought it wiser to bless these to Christian use than to
break too sharply the customs of sentiment. So a dolmen at Plouaret was
consecrated as the chapel of the Seven Saints, and the worship of the
oak was sterilized by hanging images of Christian saints upon the trees.
90 Pagan festivals dear to the people, or necessary as cathartic
moratoriums on morality, reappeared as Christian feasts, and pagan
vegetation rites were transformed into Christian liturgy. The people co
ntinued to light midsummer fires on St. John’s Eve, and the celebration
of Christ’s resurrection took the pagan name of Eostre, the old Teutonic
goddess of the spring. The Christian calendar of the saints replaced the
Roman fasti; ancient divinities dear to the people were allowed to
revive under the names of Christian saints; the Dea Victoria of the
Basscs-Alpes be- came St. Victoire, and Castor and Pollux were reborn as
Sts. Cosmas and Damian.</p>
<p>The finest triumph of this tolerant spirit of adaptation was the
sublimation</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>746</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>of the pagan mother-goddess cults in the worship of Mary. Here too
the peo- ple took the initiative. In 43 1 Cyril, Archbishop of
Alexandria, in a famous sermon at Ephesus, applied to Mary many of the
terms fondly ascribed by the pagans of Ephesus to their “great goddess”
Artemis -Diana; and the Coun- cil of Ephesus in that year, over the
protests of Nestorius, sanctioned for Mary the title “Mother of God.”
Gradually the tenderest fea tures of Astarte, Cybele, Artemis, Diana,
and Isis were gathered together in the worship of Mary. In the sixth
century the Church established the Feast of the Assump- tion of the
Virgin into heaven, and assigned it to August 13, the date of an- cient
festivals of Isis and Artemis. 91 Mary became the patron saint of Con-
stantinople and the imperial family; her picture was carried at the head
of every great procession, and was (and is) hung in every church and
home in Greek Christendom. Probably it was the Crusades that brought
from the East to the West a more intimate and colorful worship of the
Virgin. 92</p>
<p>The Church herself did not encourage Mariolatry. The Fathers had rec-
ommended Mary as an antidote to Eve; but their general hostility to
woman as “the weaker vessel” and the source of most temptations to sin;
the timid flight of monks from women; the tirades of preachers against
the charms and foibles of the sex — these could hardly have led to the
intense and ecumenical adoration of Mary. It was the people who created
the fairest flower of the medieval spirit, and made Mary the most
beloved figure in history. The pop- ulation of a recovering Europe could
no longer accept the stern picture of a god damning the majority of his
creatures to hell; and of their own accord the people softened the
terrors of the theologians with the pity of the Mother of Christ. They
would approach Jesus — still too sublime and just — through her who
refused no one, and whom her Son could not refuse. A youth, says
Caesarius of Heisterbach (1230), was persuaded by Satan, on the promise
of great wealth, to deny Christ, but could not be induced to deny Mary;
when he repented, the Virgin persuaded Christ to forgive him. The same
monk tells of a Cistercian lay brot her who was heard to pray to Christ:
“Lord, if Thou free me not from this temptation, I will complain of Thee
to Thy mother.” 93 Men prayed so much to the Virgin that popular fancy
pictured Jesus as jealous; to one who had deluged heaven with Ave Marias
He appeared (says a pretty legend), and gently reproached him: “My
mother thanks you much for all the salutations you make to her, but
still you should not forget to salute me too.” 94 Just as the sternness
of Yahveh had necessi - tated Christ, so the justice of Christ needed
Mary’s mercy to temper it. In effect the Mother — the oldest figure in
religious worship — became, as Mo- hammed had prophetically misconceived
her, the third person of a new Trinity. Everyone joined in her love and
praise: rebels like Abelard bowed to her; satirists like Rutebeuf,
roistering skeptics like the wandering schol - ars, never ventured one
irreverent word about her; knights vowed themselves to her service, and
cities gave her their keys; the rising bourgeoisie saw in her</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 747</p>
<p>the sanctifying symbol of motherhood and the family; the rough men of
the guilds — even the blaspheming heroes of barracks and battlefields —
vied with peasant maidens and bereaved mothers in bringing their prayers
and gifts to ber feet. 95 The most passionate poetry of the Middle Ages
was the litany that in mounting fervor proclaimed her glory and besought
her aid. Images of her rose everywhere, even at street corners, at
crossroads, and in the fields. Finally, in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, in the noblest birth of reli- gious feeling in history, the
poor and the rich, the humble and the great, the clergy and the laity,
the artists and the artisans devoted their savings and their skills to
honor her in a thousand cathedrals nearly all dedicated to her name, or
having as their chief splendor some Lady Chapel set aside as her
shrine.</p>
<p>A new religion had been created, and perhaps Catholicism survived by
ab- sorbing it. A Gospel of Mary took form, uncanonical, incredible, and
inde- scribably charming. The people begot the legends, the monks wrote
them down. So The Golden Legend told how a widow surrendered her only
son to her country’s call; the youth was captured by the enemy; the
widow prayed daily to the Virgin to redeem and restore her son; when
many weeks passed without response, the woman stole the sculptured Child
from the Virgin’s arms and hid Him in her home; whereupon the Virgin
opened the</p>
<p>The worship of Mary transformed Catholicism from a religion of terror
— perhaps necessary in the Dark Ages — into a religion of mercy and
love. Half the beauty of Catholic worship, much of the splendor of
Catholic art and song, are the creation of this gallant faith in the
devotion and gentleness, even the physical loveliness and grace, of
woman. The daughters of Eve have en-</p>

<p>tered the temple and have transformed its spirit. Partly because of
that new Catholicism feudalism was chastened into chivalry, and the
status of woman was moderately raised in a man-made world; because of it
medieval and Renaissance sculpture and painting gave to art a depth and
tenderness rarely known to the Greeks. One can forgive much to a
religion and an age that created Mary and her cathedrals.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RITUAL</li>
</ol>
<p>In art and hymns and liturgy the Church wisely made place for the
wor- ship of the Virgin; but in the older elements of her practice and
ritual she insisted on the sterner and more solemn aspects of the faith.
Following an- cient customs, and perhaps for reasons of health, she
prescribed periodical fasts: all Fridays were to be meatless; throughout
the forty days of Lent no meat, eggs, or cheese might be eaten, and the
fast was not to be broken till the hour of none (three p.m.) ;
furthermore, there were to be in that period no weddings, no rejoicing,
no hunting, no trials in court, no sexual intercourse. 98 These were
counsels of perfection, seldom fully observed or enforced, but they
helped to strengthen the will and to tame the excessive appetites of an
omnivorous and carnal population.</p>
<p>The liturgy of the Church was another ancient inheritance, remolded
into lofty and moving forms of religious drama, music, and art. The
Psalms of the Old Testament, the prayers and homilies of the Jerusalem
Temple, readings from the New Testament, and the administration of the
Eucharist, consti- tuted the earliest elements of the Christian service.
The division of the Church into Eastern and Western resulted in
divergent rites; and the inabil- ity of the early popes to extend their
full authority beyond Central Italy resulted in a diversity of ceremony
even in the Latin Church. A ritual estab- lished at Milan spread to
Spain, Gaul, Ireland, and North Britain, and was not overcome by the
Roman form till 664. Pope Hadrian I, probably com- pleting labors begun
by Gregory I, reformed the liturgy in a “Sacramentary”</p>
<p>The center and summit of the Christian worship was the Mass. In the
first four centuries this ceremony was called the Eucharist or
thanksgiving; and that sacramental commemoration of the Last Supper
remained the essence of the service. Around it there gathered in the
course of twelve centuries a com- plicated succession of prayers and
songs, varying with the day and season of the year and the purpose of
the individual Mass, and inscribed for the con-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 749</p>
<p>venience of the priest in the missal, or Book of the Mass. In the
Greek rite, and sometimes in the Latin, the two sexes were separated in
the congregation. There were no chairs; all stood, or, at the most
solemn moments, knelt. Ex- ceptions’ were made for old or weak people;
and for monks or canons, who had to stand through long services, little
ledges were built into the choir stalls to support the base of the
spine; these misericordiae (mercies) became a favorite recip ient of the
wood carver’s skill. The officiating priest entered in a toga covered by
alb, chasuble, maniple, and stole — colorful garments bear- ing
symbolical decorations; the most prominent symbols were usually the
letters IHS — i.e., lesos Huios Soter, “Jesus Son 〔of God〕, Saviour.”
The Mass itself was begun at the foot of the altar with a humble
Introit: “I shall go in to the altar of God,” to which the acolyte
added, “To God Who giveth joy to my youth.” The priest ascended the
altar, and kissed it as the sacred repository of saintly relics. He
intoned the Kyrie eleison (“Lord have mercy upon us”)— a Greek survival
in the Latin Mass; and recited the Gloria (“Glory to God in the
highest”) and the Credo. He consecrated little wafers of bread and a
chalice of wine into the body and blood of Christ with the words Hoc est
corpus meum * and Hie est sanguinis meus and offered these
transubstantiated elements — namely His Son — as a propitiatory
sacrifice to God in commemoration of the sacrifice on the cross, and in
lieu of the ancient sacrifice of living things. Turning to the
worshipers, he bade them lift up their hearts to God: sursum cor da-, to
which the acolyte, representing the congregation, answered, Habemus ad
Dominum - . “We hold them up to the Lord.” The priest then recited the
triple Sanctus, the Agnus Dei, and the Pater noster; himself partook of
the consecrated bread and wine, and admin- istered the Eucharist to
communicants. After some additional prayers he pro- nounced the closing
formula — Ite, missa err — “Depart, it is dismissal”— from which the
Mass {missa) probably derived its name.“ In late forms there still
followed a blessing of the congregation by the priest, and another
Gospel reading — usually the Neoplatonic exordium of the Gospel of
St. John. Nor- mally there was no sermon except when a bishop
officiated, or when, after the twelfth century, a friar came to
preach.</p>
<p>At first all Masses were sung, and the congregation joined in the
singing; from the fourth century onward the vocal participation of the
worshipers declined, and “canonical choristers” provided the musical
response to the celebrant’s chant, t The hymns sung in the various
services of the Church are among the most moving products of medieval
sentiment and art. The known history of the Latin hymn begins with
Bishop Hilary of Poitiers (d. 367). Returning to Gaul from exile in
Syria, he brought home some Greco- Oriental hymns, translated them into
Latin, and composed some of his own; all of these are lost. Ambrose at
Milan made a new beginning; eighteen sur-</p>

<p>vive of his sonorous hymns, whose restrained fervor so affected
Augustine. The noble hymn of faith and thanksgiving, Te Deum laudamus,
formerly ascribed to Ambrose, was probably written by the Romanian
Bishop Nicetas of Remisiana toward the end of the fourth century. In
later centuries the Latin hymns may have assumed a new delicacy of
feeling and form under the influence of Moslem and Provengal love
poetry. 100 Some of the hymns (like some Arabic poems) verged on
jingling doggerel, tipsy with excess of rhyme; but the better hymns of
the medieval flowering — the twelfth and thirteenth centuries —
developed a subtle turn of compact phrase, a melodiousness of frequent
rhyme, a grace and tenderness of thought, that rank them with the
greatest lyrics in literature.</p>
<p>To the famous monastery of St. Victor, outside of Paris, there came
about 1130a Breton youth known to us only as Adam of St. Victor. He
lived there in quiet content his remaining sixty years, imbibed the
spirit of the famous mystics Hugo and Richard, and expressed it humbly,
beautifully, and pow-</p>
<p>erfully in hymns mostly designed as sequences for the Mass. A century
after him a Franciscan monk, Jacopone da Todi (i228?-i3o6), composed the
supreme medieval lyric, the Stab at Mater . Jacopone was a successful
lawyer in Todi, near Perugia; his wife was renowned for both goodness
and loveli- ness; she was crushed to death by the fall of a platform at
a festival; Jacopone became insane with grief, roamed the Umbrian roads
as a wild vagrant cry- ing out his sins and sorrows; smeared himself
with tar and feathers, and walked on all fours; joined the Franciscan
tertiaries, and wrote the poem that sums up the tender piety of his
time:</p>

<p>Only two poems rival this among medieval Christian hymns. One is the
Pange lingua that St. Thomas Aquinas composed for the Corpus Christi
feast. The other is the terrible Dies irae, or “Day of Wrath,” written
about 1250 by Thomas of Celano, and still sung in the Mass for the Dead;
here the horror of the Last Judgment inspires a poem as dark and perfect
as any of Dante’s tormented dreams. 101</p>
<p>To the moving ritual of her prayers, hymns, and Mass the Church added
the imposing ceremonies and processions of religious festivals. In
northern countries the Feast of the Nativity took over the pleasant
rites wherewith the pagan Teutons had celebrated the victory of the sun,
at the winter solstice, over the advancing night; hence the “Yule” logs
that burned in German, North French, English, Scandinavian homes, and
the Yule trees laden with gifts, and the merry feasting that tried
strong stomachs till the Twelfth Night thereafter. There were countless
other feasts or holydays — Epiphany, Circumcision, Palm Sunday, Easter,
Ascension, Pentecost. . . . Such days — and only in less degree all
Sundays — were exciting events in the life of me- dieval man. For Easter
he confessed such of his sins as he cared to remember,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>bathed, cut his beard or hair, dressed in his best and most
uncomfortable clothes, received God in the Eucharist, and felt more
profoundly than ever the momentous Christian drama of which he was made
a part. In many towns, on the last three days of Holy Week, the events
of the Passion were represented in the churches by a religious play,
with dialogue and plain chant; and several other occasions of the
ecclesiastical year were signalized with such “mysteries.” About 1 240
Juliana, prioress of a convent near Liege, reported to her village
priest that a supernatural vision had urged upon her the need of
honoring with a solemn festival the body of Christ as transub-
stantiated in the Eucharist; in 1262 Pope Urban IV sanctioned such a
cele- bration, and entrusted to St. Thomas Aquinas the compositi on of
an “office” for it — appropriate hymns and prayers; the philosopher
acquitted himself wonderfully well in this assignment; and in 1 3 1 1
the Feast of Corpus Christi was finally established and was celebrated
on the first Thursday after Pente- cost, with the most impressive
procession of the Christian year. Such cere- monies drew immense crowds,
and glorified numerous participants; they opened the way to the medieval
secular drama; and they helped the pag- eantry of the guilds, the
tournaments and knightly initiations, and the coro- nation of kings, to
occupy with pious flurry and sublimating spectacle the occasional
leisure of men not natively inclined to order and peace. The Church
based her technique of moralization through faith not on arguments to
reason but on appeals to the senses through drama, music, painting,
sculp- ture, architecture, fiction, and poetry; and it must be confessed
that such appeals to universal sensibilities are more successful — for
evil as well as for good — than challenges to the changeful and
individualistic intellect. Through such appeals the Church created
medieval art.</p>
<p>The culminating pageants were at the goals of pilgrimage. Medieval
men and women went on pilgrimage to fulfill a penance or a vow, or to
seek a miraculous cure, or to earn an indulgence, and doubtless, like
modern tourists, to see strange lands and sights, and find adventure on
the way as a relief from the routine of a narrow life. At the end of the
thirteenth century there were some 10,000 sanctioned goals of Christian
pilgrimage. The bravest pilgrims fared to distant Palestine, sometimes
barefoot or clothed only in a shirt, and usually armed with cross,
staff, and purse all given by a priest. In 1054 Bishop Liedbert of
Cambrai led 3000 pilgrims to Jerusalem; in 1064 the archbishops of
Cologne and Mainz, and the bishops of Speyer, Bamberg, and Utrecht
started for Jerusalem with 10,000 Christians in their wake; 3000 of them
perished on the way; only 2000 returned safely to their native lands.
Other pilgrims crossed the Pyrenees, or risked themselves on the
Atlantic, to visit the reputed bones of the apostle James at Compostela
in Spain. In England pilgrims sought the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham,
the grave of Edward the Confessor in Westminster, or that of St. Edmund
at Bury, the church supposedly founded by Joseph of Arimathea at
Glastonbury, and above all,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 753</p>
<p>the shrine of Thomas a Becket at Canterbury. France drew pilgrims to
St. Martin’s at Tours, to Notre Dame at Chartres, Notre Dame at Le
-Puy-en- Velay. Italy had the church and bones of St. Francis at Assisi,
and the Santa Casa, or Holy House, at Loreto, which the pious believed
to be the very dwelling in which Mary had lived with Jesus at Nazareth;
when the Turks drove the last Crusader from Palestine this cottage was
carried by angels through the air and deposited in Dalmatia (1291), then
flown across the Adri- atic to the Ancona woods ( lauretum ) from which
the honored village took its name.</p>
<p>Finally, all the roads of Christendom led pilgrims to Rome, to see
the tombs of Peter and Paul, to earn indulgences by visiting the
Stations or famous churches of the city, or to celebrate some jubilee,
or joyous anniversary, in Christian history. In 1 299 Pope Boniface VIII
declared a jubilee for 1 300, and offered a plenary indulgence to those
who should come and worship in St. Peter’s in that year. It was
estimated that on no day in those twelve months had Rome less than
200,000 strangers within her gates; and a total of 2,000,000 visitors,
each with a modest offering, deposited such treasure before St. Peter’s
tomb that two priests, with rakes in their hands, were kept busy night
and day collecting the coins. 102 Guidebooks taught the pilgrims by what
roads to travel, and what points to visit at their goal or on the way.
We may weakly imagine the exaltation of the tired and dusty pilgrims
when at last they sighted the Eternal City, and burst into the Pilgrims’
Chorus of joy and praise:</p>
<p>O Roma nobilis, orbis et domina,</p>
<p>cunctarum urbium excellentissima,</p>
<p>roseo martyrum sanguine rubea,</p>
<p>albis et virginum liliis Candida;</p>
<p>salutem dicimus tibi per omnia;</p>
<p>te benedicimus; salve per saecula!</p>
<p>“O noble Rome, of all this wo rld the queen, of all the cities the
most excel- lent! O ruby red with martyrs’ rosy blood, yet white with
lilies pure of virgin maids; we give thee salutation through all years;
we bless thee; through all generations hail!”</p>
<p>To these varied religious services the Church added social services.
She taught the dignity of labor, and practiced it through the
agriculture and in- dustry of her monks. She sanctified the organization
of labor in the guilds, and organized religious guilds to perform works
of charity. 103 Every church was a sanctuary with right of asylum in
which hunted men might find some breathless refuge till the passions of
their pursuers could yield to the processes of law; to drag men from
such a sanctuary was a sacrilege entailing excom- munication. The church
or cathedral was the social as well as the religious center of the
village or town. Sometimes the sacred precinct, or even the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>754</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>church itself, was used, with genial clerical consent, to store grain
or hay or wine, to grind corn or brew beer. 104 There most of the
villagers had been bap- tized, there most of them would be buried. There
the older folk would gather of a Sunday for gossip or discussion, and
the young men and women to see and be seen. There the beggars assembled,
and the alms of the Church were dispensed. There nearly all the art that
the village knew was brought together to beautify the House of God; and
the poverty of a thousand homes was brightened by the glory of that
temple which the people had built with their coins and hands, and which
they considered their own, their collective and spiritual home. In the
church belfry the bells rang the hours of the day or the call to
services and prayer; and the music of those bells wa£ sweeter than any
other except the hymns that bound voices and hearts into one, or warmed
a cooling faith with the canticles of the Mass. From Novgorod to Cadiz,
from Jerusalem to the Hebrides, steeples and spires raised themselves
precariously into the sky because men cannot live without hope, and will
not consent to die.</p>
<p>V. CANON LAW</p>
<p>Side by side with this complex and colorful liturgy there developed
the even more complex body of ecclesiastical legislation that regulated
the con- duct and decisions of a Church governing a wider and more
varied realm than any empire of the time. Canon law — the “law of the
rule” of the Church — was a slow accretion of old religious customs,
scriptural passages, opinions of the Fathers, laws of Rome or the
barbarians, the decrees of Church councils, and the decisions and
opinions of the popes. Some parts of the Justinian Code were adapted to
govern the conduct of the clergy; other parts were recast to accord with
the views of the Church on marriage, divorce, and wills. Collec- tions
of ecclesiastical legislation were made in the sixth and eighth
centuries in the West, and periodically by Byzantine emperors in the
East. The laws of the Roman Church received their definitive medieval
formulation by Gratian about i 148.</p>
<p>As a monk of Bologna, Gratian may have studied under Irnerius in the
university there; certainly his digest shows a wide acquaintance with
both Roman law and medieval philosophy. He called his book Concordia
dis- cordantium canonum — reconciliation of discordant regulations;
later genera- tions called it his Decretum. It drew into order and
sequence the laws and customs, the conciliar and papal decrees, of the
Church down to 1 1 39 on her doctrine, ritual, organization, and
administration, the maintenance of ecclesi- astical property, the
procedure and precedents of ecclesiastical courts, the regulation of
monastic life, the contract of marriage, and the rules of bequest. The
method of exposition may have stemmed from Abe lard’s Sic et non, and
had in turn some influence on Scholastic method after Gratian: it began
with</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 755</p>
<p>an authoritative proposition, quoted statements or precedents
contradicting it, sought to resolve the contradiction, and added a
commentary. Though the book was not accepted by the medieval Church as a
final authority, it became, for the period it covered, the indispensable
and almost sacred text. Gregory IX (1234), Boniface VIII (1294), and
Clement V (1313) added supple-</p>
<p>ments; these and some minor additions were published with Gratian’s
Concordia in 1582 as Corpus iuris canonici , a body of canonical —
Church- regulating — law comparable with the Corpus iuris civilis of
Justinian.*</p>
<p>Indeed, the field covered by canon law was larger than that covered
by any contemporary civil code. It embraced not merely the structure,
dogmas, and operation of the Church, but rules for dealing with
non-Christians in Chris- tian glands; procedure in the investigation and
suppression of heresy; the organization of crusades; the laws of
marriage, legitimacy, dower, adultery, divorce, wills, burial, widows,
and orphans; laws of oath, perjury, sacrilege, blasphemy, simony, libel,
usury, and just price; regulations for schools and universities; the
Truce of God and other means of limiting war and organiz- ing peace; the
conduct of episcopal and papal courts; the use of excommuni- cation,
anathema, and interdict; the administration of ecclesiastical penalties;
the relations between civil and ecclesiastical courts, between state and
Church. This vast body of legislation was held by the Church to be
binding on all Christians, and she reserved the right to punish any
infraction of it with a variety of physical or spiritual penalties,
except that no ecclesiastical court was to pronounce a “judgment of
blood ,, — i.e., condemn to capital punish- ment.</p>
<p>Usually, before the Inquisition, the Church relied on spiritual
terrors. Minor excommunication excluded a Christian from the sacraments
and ritual of the Church; any priest could pronounce this penalty; and
to believers it meant everlasting hell if death should reach the
offender before absolution came. A major excommunication (the only kind
now used by the Church) could be pronounced only by councils or by
prelates higher than a priest, and only upon persons within their
jurisdiction. It removed the victim from all legal or spiritual
association with the Christian community: he could not sue or inherit or
do any valid act in law, but he could be sued; and no Christian was to
eat or talk with him on pain of minor excommunication. When King Robert
of France was excommunicated (998) for marrying his cousin he was
abandoned by all his courtiers and nearly all his servants; two
domestics who remained threw into the fire the victuals left by him at
his meals, lest they be contaminated by them. In extreme cases the
Church added to excommunica- tion anathema — a curse armed and detailed
witli all the careful pleonasm of legal phraseology. As a last resort
the pope could lay an interdict upon any part of Christendom — i.e.,
suspend all or most religious services. A people feeling the need of the
sacraments, and fearful of death supervening upon</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>

<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>unforgiven sins, sooner or later compelled the excommunicated
individual to make his peace with the Church. Such interdicts were laid
upon France in 998, Germany in 1 102, England in 1 208, Rome itself in 1
155.</p>
<p>The excessive use of excommunication and interdict weakened their
effec- tiveness after the eleventh century. 108 Popes employed
interdict, now and then, for political purposes, aswhen Innocent II
threatened Pisa with interdict if it did not join the Tuscan League. 106
Wholesale excommunications — e.g., for false returns of tithes due the
Church — were so numerous that large sec- tions of the Christian
community were outlawed at once or without knowing it; and many who knew
it ignored the curse or laughed it off. 107 Milan, Bologna, and Florence
thrice received wholesale excommunications in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries; Milan ignored the third edict for twenty- two y
ears. Said Bishop Guillaume le Maire in 1 3 1 1 : “I have sometimes seen
with my own eyes three or four hundred excommunicates in a single
parish, and even seven hundred . . . who despised the Power of the Keys,
and uttered blasphemous and scandalous wo rds against the Church and her
ministers.” 108 Philip Augustus and Philip the Fair paid little
attention to the decrees that excommunicated them.</p>
<p>Such occasional indifference marked the beginning of a decline in the
authority of canon law over the laity of Europe. As the Church had taken
so wide an area of human life under her rule when, in the first
Christian millen- nium, secular powers had broken down, so in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as secular government grew
stronger, one phase after another of human affairs was recaptured by
civil from canon law. The Church properly won in the matter of
ecclesiastical appointments; in most other fields her authority began to
decline — in education, marriage, morals, economy, and war. The states
that had grown up under the protection, and by the permis- sion, of the
social order that she had created declared themselves of age, and began
that long process of secularization which culminates today. But the work
of the canonists, like most creative activity, was not lost. It prepared
and trained the Church’s greatest statesmen; it shared in transmitting
Roman law to the modern world; it raised the legal rights of widows and
children, and established the principle of dower in the civil law of
Western Europe; 109 and it helped to shape the form and terms of
Scholastic philosophy. Canon law was among the major achievements of the
medieval mind.</p>

<li>THE CLERGY</li>
</ol>
<p>Medieval parlance divided all persons into two classes: those who
lived under a re ligious rule, and those who lived “in the world.” A
monk was “a religious”; so was a nun. Some monks were also priests, and
constituted the “regular clergy”— i.e., clergy following a monastic rule
( regula ) . All other</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 757</p>
<p>clergy were called “secular,” as living in the “world” (saeculum) .
All ranks of clergy were distinguished by the tonsure — a shaven crown
of the head — and wore a long robe, of any single color but red or
green, buttoned from head to foot . The term clergy included not only
those in “minor orders”— i.e., church doorkeepers, readers, exorcists,
and acolytes — but all university students, all teachers, and all who,
having taken the tonsure as students, later became physicians, lawyers,
artists, authors, or served as accountants or liter- ary aides; hence
the later narrowing of the terms clerical and clerk. Clerics who had not
taken major orders were allowed to marry, and to take up any respectable
profession, and they were under no obligation to continue the
tonsure.</p>
<p>The three “major” or “holy orders”— subdeacon, deacon, priest — were
ir- revocable, and generally closed the door to marriage after the
eleventh cen- tury. Instances of marriage or concubinage in the Latin
priesthood after Gregory VII are recorded , 110 but they become more and
more exceptional.* The parish priest had to content himself with
spiritual joys. As the parish was normally coterminous with a manor or a
village, he was usually appointed by the lord of the manor 111 in
collusion with the bishop. He was seldom a man of much schooling, for a
university education was costly and books were rare; it was enough if he
could read the breviary and the missal, administer the sacraments, and
organize the parish for worship and charity. In many cases he was only a
vicarius, a vicar or substitute, hired by a rector to do the reli- gious
work of the parish for a fourth of the revenues of the “benefice”; in
this way one rector might hold four or five benefices while the parish
priest lived in humble poverty , 112 eking out his income with “altar
fees” for baptisms, marriages, burials, and Masses for the dead.
Sometimes, in the class war, he sided with the poor, like John Ball .
113 His morals could not compare with those of the modern priest, who
has been put on his best behavior by religious competition; but by and
large he did his work with patience, conscience, and kindliness. He
visited the sick, comforted the bereaved, taught the young, mumbled his
breviary, and brought some moral and civilizing leaven to a rough and
lusty population. Many parish priests, said their crudest critic, “were
the salt of the earth.” 114 “No other body of men,” said the freethink -
ing Lecky, “have ever exhibited a more single -minded and unworldly
zeal,</p>
<ul>
<li>The general celibacy of monks, priests, and nuns after 1215 presents
a problem in genetics. It may be that Europe suffered some biological
loss by the abstention of so many able persons from parentage, but we do
not know to what extent superior ability is inherited. Less theo-
retical were the effects of the numerical disbalance caused between the
sexes in the lay popu- lation by the withdrawal of monks and priests
from marriage. As commercial and other travel, war and Crusades, feuds
and other hazards raised the death rate of men above that of women,
a</li>
</ul>
<p>substantial percentage of the female sex was left to spinsterhood or
promiscuity. The Church welcomed into nunneries such qualified women as
cared to enter, but monks and priests com- bined far outnumbered nuns.
The unmarried daughters of the nobility were often dowered to a convent;
but in other classes surplus women resigned themselves to the spinning
wheel, or lived as tolerated aunts with their relatives, or devoted
themselves, in shame and terrpr, to satisfying the demands of
respectable men.</p>

<p>refracted by no personal interests, sacrificing to duty the dearest
of earthly objects, and confronting with dauntless heroism every form of
hardship, of suffering, and of death.” 115</p>
<p>Priesthood and episcopate constituted the sacerdotium , or sacerdotal
order. The bishop was a priest selected to co-ordinate several parishes
and priests into one diocese. Originally and theoretically he was chosen
by priests and people; usually, before Gregory VII, he was named by the
baron or king; after 12 15 he was elected by the cathedral chapter in
co-operation with the pope. To his care were committed many secular as
well as ecclesiastical affairs, and his episcopal court tried some civil
cases as well as all those involv- ing clergy of any rank. He had the
power to appoint and depose priests; but his authority over the abbots
and monasteries in his diocese diminished in this period, as the popes,
fearing the power of the bishops, brought the monastic orders under
direct papal control. His revenues came partly from his parishes, mostly
from the estates attached to his see; sometimes he gave more to a parish
than he received from it. Candidates for a bishopric usually agreed to
pay — at first to the king, later to the pope — a fee for their
nomination; and as secular rulers they sometimes yielded to the amiable
weakness of appointing relatives to lucrative posts; Pope Alexander III
compl ained that “when God deprived bishops of sons the Devil gave them
nephews.” 116 Many bishops lived in lux - ury, as became feudal lords;
but many were consumed in devotion to their spiritual and administrative
tasks. After the reform of the episcopate by Leo IX the bishops of
Europe were, in mind and morals, the finest body of men in medieval
history.</p>
<p>Above the bishops of a province stood the archbishop or metropolitan.
He alone could call, or preside over, a provincial council of the
Church. Some archbishops, by their character or their wealth, ruled
nearly all the life of their provinces. In Germany the archbishops of
Hamburg, Bremen, Cologne, Trier, Mainz, Magdeburg, and Salzburg were
powerful feudal lords, who were in several instances chosen by the
emperors to administer the Empire, or to serve as ambassadors or royal
councilors; the archbishops of Reims, Rouen, and Canterbury played a
similar role in France, Normandy, and England. Certain archbishops — of
Toledo, Lyons, Narbonne, Reims, Cologne, Canter- bury — were made
“primates,” and exercised a debated authority over all the ecclesiastics
of their region.</p>
<p>The bishops gathered in council constituted, periodically, a
representative government for the Church. In later centuries these
councils would lay claim to powers superior to those of the pope; but in
this, the age of the greatest pontiffs, no one in Western Europe
questioned the supreme ecclesiastical and spiritual authority of the
bishop of Rome. The scandals of the tenth century had been atoned for by
the virtues of Leo IX and Hildebrand; amid the oscil- lations and
struggles of the twelfth century the power of the papacy had grown
until, in Innocent III, it claimed to overspread the earth. Kings
and</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 759</p>
<p>emperors held the stirrup and kissed the feet of the white-robed
Servant of the Servants of God. The papacy was now the highest reach of
human ambi- tion; the finest minds of the time prepared themselves in
rigorous schools of theology and law for a place in the hierarchy of the
Church; and those who rose to the top were men of intelligence and
courage, who were not appalled by the task of governing a continent.
Their individual deaths hardly disturbed the pursuit of the policies
formed by them and their councils; what Gregory VII left unfinished
Innocent III completed; and Innocent IV and Alexander IV carried to a
victorious end the struggle that Innocent III and Gregory IX had fought
against Imperial encirclement of the papacy.</p>
<p>In theory the authority of the pope was derived from his succession
to the power conferred upon the apostles by Christ; in this sense the
government of the Church was a theocracy — a government of the people,
through reli- gion, by the earthly vicars of God. In another sense the
Church was a democ- racy: every man in Christendom except the mentally
or physically defective, the convicted criminal, the excommunicate and
the slave was eligible to the priesthood and the papacy. As in every
system, the rich had superior oppor- tunities to prepare themselves for
the long hierarchical climb; but career was open to all, and talent, not
ancestry, chiefly determined success. Hundreds of bishops, and several
popes, came from the ranks of the poor. 117 This flow of fresh blood
into the hierarchy from every rank continually nourished the
intelligence of the clergy, and “was for ages the only practical
recognition of the equality of man.” *</p>
<p>In 1059, as we have seen, the right to select the pope was confined
to “cardinal bishops” stationed near Rome. These seven cardinals were
gradu - ally increased, by papal appointment from various nations, to a
Sacred Col- lege of seventy members, who were marked off by their red
caps and purple robes, and constituted a new rank in the hierarchy,
second only to the pope himself.</p>
<p>Aided by such men, and by a large staff of ecclesiastics and other
-officials constituting the papal Curia or executive and judicial court,
the pope gov- erned a spiritual empire which in the thirteenth century
was at the height of its curve. He alone could summon a general council
of the bishops, and their legislation had no force except when confirmed
by his decree. He was free to interpret, revise, and extend the canon
law of the Church, and to grant dis- pensations from its rules. He was
the final court of appeals from the decisions</p>

the incredibly vigorous power that inhabits this age-old institution.
This gigantic host of clerical dignitaries, by uninterruptedly
supplementing itself from the lowest layers of the nations, preserves
not only its instinctive bond with the people’s world of sentiment, but
it also assures itself of a sum of energy and active force which in such
a form will forever be present only in the broad masses of the people” (

<p>of episcopal courts. He alone could absolve from certain grave sins,
or issue major indulgences, or canonize a saint. After 1059 all bishops
had to swear obedience to him, and submit to supervision of their
affairs by legates of the pope. Islands like Sardinia and Sicily,
nations like England, Hungary, and Spain, acknowledged him as their
feudal lord, and sent him tribute. Through bishops, priests, and monks
his eyes and hands could be on every part of his realm; these men
constituted a service of intelligence and administration with which no
state could compete. Gradually, subtly, the rule of Rome was re- stored
over Europe by the astonishing power of the word.</p>

<p>The conflict between Church and state over lay investitures did not

continued for a generation through several pontificates, and reached a
compromise in the Concordat of Worms (1122) between Pope Calixtus II and

Christianity; his opponents called him “Judaeo - pontifex”; and
St. Bernard, who on other occasions was friendly to the Jews, wrote to
the Emperor Lothaire II that “to the shame of Christ a man of Jewish
origin was come to occupy the chair of St. Peter”— forgetting Peter’s
origin. The greater part of the clergy, and all but one of Europe’s
kings, upheld Innocent. The populace of Europe amused itself with
slanders charging Anacletus with incest, and with plundering Christian
churches to enrich his Jewish friends; but the people of Rome supported
him till his death ( 1 1 38) . It was probably the story of Anacletus
that led to the fourteenth- century legend of Andreas “the Jewish Pope.”

<p>aux talents. Born in England of lowly parentage, and coming as a
beggar to a monastery, Nicholas Breakspear raised himself by pure
ability to be abbot, cardinal, and pope. He bestowed Ireland upon Henry
II of England, com- pelled Barbarossa to kiss his feet, and almost
maneuvered the great Emperor into conceding the right of the popes to
dispose of royal thrones. When Hadrian died a majority of cardinals
chose Alexander III (1159-81), a minority chose Victor IV. Barbarossa,
thinking to restore the power once held by German emperors over the
papacy, invited both men to lay their claims before him; Alexander
refused, Victor agreed; and at the Synod of Pavia (1160) Barbarossa
recognized Victor as Pope. Alexander excommuni- cated Frederick,
released the Emperor’s subjects from civil obedience, and helped revolt
in Lombardy. The victory of tbe Lombard League at Legnano (1176) humbled
Frederick. He made his peace with Alexander at Venice, and once more
kissed papal feet. The same pontiff compelled Henry II of England to
repair barefoot to the tomb of Becket, and there receive discipline from
the canons of Canterbury. It w as Alexander’s long struggle and com -
plete victory that made straight the way for one of the greatest
popes.</p>
<p>Innocent III was born at Anagni, near Rome, in 1 1 6 1 . As Lotario
dei Conti, son of the count of Segni, he had all the advantages of
aristocratic birth and cultured rearing. He studied philosophy and
theology at Paris, canon and civil law at Bologna. Back in Rome, by his
mastery of both diplomacy and doctrine, and his influential connections,
he advanced rapidly on the ecclesi- astical ladder; at thirty he was a
cardinal deacon; and at thirty-seven, though still not a priest, he was
unanimously chosen pope (1198). He was ordained on one day, and
consecrated on the next. It was his good fortune that the Emperor Henry
VI, who had acquired control of South Italy and Sicily, had died in 1
197, leaving the throne to the three-year-old Frederick II. Innocent
seized the opportunity vigorously: deposed the German prefect in Rome,
ousted the German feudatories from Spoleto and Perugia, received the
sub- mission of Tuscany, re-established the rule of the papacy in the
Papal States, was recognized by Henry’s widow as overlord of the Two
Sicilies, and con - sented to be the guardian of her son. In ten months
Innocent had made himself master of Italy.</p>
<p>He had, on the existing evidence, the best mind of his time. In his
early thirties he had written four works of theology; they were learned
and elo- quent, but they are lost in the glare of his political fame.
His pronouncements as Pope were characterized by a clarity and logic of
thought, a fitness and pungency of phrase, that could have made him a
brilliant Aquinas or an orthodox Abelard. Despite his small stature he
derived a commanding pres- ence from his keen eyes and stern dark face.
He was not without humor; he sang well, and composed poetry; he had a
tender side, and could be kindly, patient, and personally tolerant. But
in doctrine and morals he allowed no</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>762</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>deviation from the dogmas or ethics of the Church. The world of
Christian faith and hope was the empire that he had been named to
protect; and like any king he would guard his realm with the sword when
the word did not suffice. Born to riches, he lived in philosophic
simplicity; in an age of universal venality he remained incorruptible;
120 at once after his consecration he for- bade the officials of his
Curia to charge for their services. He liked to see the wealth of the
world enrich Peter’s See, but he administered the papal fun ds with a
reasonably honest hand. He was a consummate diplomat, and moder- ately
shared in the reluctant unmorality of that distinguished trade. 121 As
if eleven centuries had fallen away, he was a Roman emperor, Stoic
rather than Christian, and never doubting his right to rule the
world.</p>
<p>With so many strong popes in the fresh memory of Rome, it was natural
that Innocent should base his policies upon a belief in the sanctity and
high mission of his office. He carefully maintained the pomp and majesty
of papal ceremony, and never stooped in public from imperial dignity.
Sincerely be- lieving himself the heir to the powers then generally
conceded to have been given by the Son of God to the apostles and the
Church, he could hardly recognize any auth ority as equal to his own.
“The Lord left to Peter,” he said, “the government not only of all the
Church, but of the whole world.” 122</p>
<p>In 1204, through the conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders, he
achieved one part of his plans: the Greek Church submitted to the Bishop
of Rome, and Innocent could speak with joy of “the seamless garment of
Christ.” He brought Serbia and even distant Armenia under the dominion
of the Roman See. Gradually he secured control over ecclesiastical
appoint- ments, and made the powerful episcopacy the organ and servant
of the papacy. Through an astonishing succession of vital conflicts he
reduced the potentates of Europe to an unprecedented recognition of his
sovereignty. His policies were least effective in Italy: he failed in
repeated efforts to end the wars of the Italian city-states; and in Rome
his political enemies made life so unsafe for him that for a time he had
to shun his capital. King Sverre of Norway (1184-1202) successfully
resisted him despite excommunication and interdict. 124 Philip II of
France ignored his command to make peace with England, but yielded to
the Pope’s insistence that he take back his discarded wife. Alfonso IX
of Leon was persuaded to put away Berengaria, whom he had married within
the forbidden degrees of kinship. Portugal, Aragon, Hun- gary, and
Bulgaria acknowledged themselves as feudal fiefs of the papacy,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 763</p>
<p>and sent it tribute yearly. When King John rejected Innocent’s
appointment of Langton as archbishop of Canterbury, the Pope drove him
by interdict and shrewd diplomacy to add England to the list of papal
fiefs. Innocent extended his power in Germany by supporting Otto IV
against Philip of Swabia, then Philip against Otto, then Otto against
Frederick II, then Frederick against Otto, in each case exacting
concessions to the papacy as the price of his favor, and freeing the
Papal States from the threat of encirclement. He reminded the emperors
that it wa s a pope who had “translated” the imperiwn or im - perial
power from the Greeks to the Franks; that Charlemagne had been made
Emperor only by papal anointment and coronation; and that what the popes
had given they could take away. A Byzantine visitor to Rome described
Inno- cent as “the successor not of Peter but of Constantine.” 125</p>
<p>He repelled all secular efforts to tax the Christian clergy without
papal consent. He provided papal funds for necessitous priests, and
labored to im- prove the education of the clergy. He raised the social
status of the clergy by defining the Church not as all Christian
believers but as all the Christian clergy. He condemned the episcopal or
monastic absorption of parochial tithes at the expense of the parish
priest. 126 To reform monastic laxity he ordered the regular
surveillance and visitation of monasteries and convents. His legislation
reduced to order the complex relations of clergy and laity, priest and
bishop, bishop and pope. He developed the papal Curia to an effi- cient
court of counsel, administration, and judgment; it became now the most
competent governing body of its time, and its methods and terminology
helped to form the art and technique of diplomacy. Innocent himself was
probably the best lawyer of the age, capable of finding legal support,
in logic and precedent, for every decision that he made. Lawyers and
learned men frequented the “consistory” where he presided over the
cardinals as a supe - rior ecclesiastical court, to profit from his
discussions and decisions on points of civil or canon law. Some called
him Pater iuris, Father of the Law; 127 others, in fond humor, called
him Solomon III. 128</p>
<p>In his final triumph as legislator and Pope, he presided in 1215 over
the Fourth Lateran Co uncil, held in the church of St. John’s Lateran in
Rome. To this twelfth ecumenical council came 1500 abbots, bishops,
archbishops, and other prelates, and plenipotentiaries from all the
important nations of a united Christendom. The Pope’s opening addr ess
was a bold admission and challenge: “The corruption of the people has
its chief source in the clergy. From this arise the evils of
Christendom: faith perishes, religion is defaced . . . justice is
trodden under foot, heretics multiply, schismatics are emboldened, the
faithless grow strong, the Saracens triumph.” 129 The assembled power
and intellect of the Church here allowed itself to be completely
dominated by one man. His judgments became the Council’s decrees. It
allowed him to redefine the basic dogmas of the Church; now for the
first time the doctrine of transubstantiation was officially defined. It
accepted his decrees requir-</p>
<p>7^4 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>ing that a distinctive badge be worn by non-Christians in Christian
lands. It responded enthusiastically to his call for a war against the
Albigensian heretics. But it also followed his lead in recognizing the
shortcomings of the Church. It denounced the peddling of fraudulent
relics. It severely censured the “indiscreet and superfluous indulgences
which some prelates . . . are not afraid to grant, whereby the Keys of
the Church are made contemptible, and the satisfaction of penance is
deprived of its force.” 130 It attempted a far - reaching reform of
monastic life. It denounced clerical drunkenness, im- morality, and
clandestine marriage, and passed vigorous measures against them; but it
condemned the Albigensian claim that all sexual intercourse is sinful.
In its attendance, scope, and effects the Fourth Lateran Council was the
most important assembly of the Church since the Council of Nicaea.</p>
<p>From that apex of his career Innocent declined rapidly to an early
death. He had given himself so unremittingly to the administration and
enlargement of his office that at fifty- five he was exhausted. “I have
no leisure,” he mourned, “to meditate on supramundane things. Scarce can
I breathe. So much must I live for others that almost I am a stranger to
myself.” 131 Perhaps in his last year he could look back upon his work
and judge it more objec- tively than in the heat of strife. The crusades
that he had organized for the reconquest of Palestine had failed; the
one that would succeed after his death was the ferocious extermination
of the Albigensians in southern France. He had won the admiration of his
contemporaries, but not, like Gregory I or Leo IX, their affection. Some
churchmen complained that he was too much the king, too little the
priest; St. Lutgardis thought he could only by a narrow margin escape
hell; 132 and the Church herself, though proud of his genius and
grateful for his labors, withheld from him that canonization which she
had conferred upon lesser and more scrupulous men.</p>
<p>But we must not refuse him the credit of having brought the Church to
her greatest height, and close to the realization of her dream of a
moral world-state. He was the ablest statesman of his age. He pursued
his aims with vision, devotion, flexible persistence, and unbelievable
energy. When he died ( 1 2 1 6) the Church had reached a height of
organization, splendor, re- pute, and power which she had never known
before, and would only rarely and briefly know again.</p>
<p>Honorius III ( 1 1 1 6-27) does not rank high in the cruel annals of
history, because he was too gentle to carry on with vigor the war
between Empire and papacy. Gregory IX ( 1 2 2 7-4 1 ) , though eighty
when made Pope, waged that war with almost fanatical tenacity; fought
Frederick II so successfully as to postpone the Renaissance for a
hundred years; and organized the Inqui- sition. Yet he too was a man of
unquestionable sincerity and heroic devotion, who defended what seemed
to him the most precious possession of mankind — its Christ-begotten
faith. He could not have been a hard man who, as car-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 765</p>
<p>dinal, had protected and wisely guided the possibly heretical
Francis. Inno- cent IV ( 1 243-54) destroyed Frederick II, and
sanctioned the use of torture by the Inquisition. 133 He was a good
patron of philosophy, aided the uni- versities, and founded schools of
law. Alexander IV (1254-61) was a man of peace, kindly, merciful, and
just, who “astounded the world by his free - dom from despotism”; 134 he
deprecated the martial qualities of his predeces - sors, 13 5 preferred
piety to politics, and “died of a broken heart,” said a Franciscan
chronicler, “considering daily the terrible and increasing strife among
Christians.” 136 Clement IV ( 1265 -8) returned to war, organized the
defeat of Manfred, and ruined the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Imperial Ger-
many. The recapture of Constantinople by the Greeks threatened to end
the accord between the Greek and the Roman Church; but Gregory X ( 1
271-6) earned the gratitude of Michael Palaeologus by discountenancing
the ambi- tion of Charles of Anjou to conquer Byzantium; the restored
Greek Em- peror submitted the Eastern Church to Rome; and the papacy was
again supreme.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE FINANCES OF THE CHURCH</li>
</ol>
<p>A Church that was actually a European superstate, dealing with the
wor- ship, morals, education, marriages, wars, crusades, deaths, and
wills of the population of half a continent, sharing actively in the
administration of secu- lar affairs, and raising the most expensive
structures in medieval history, could sustain its functions only through
exploiting a hundred sources of revenue.</p>
<p>The widest stream of income was the tithe: after Charlemagne all
secular lands in Latin Christendom were required by state law to pay a
tenth of their gross produce or income, in kind or money, to the local
church. After the tenth century every parish had to remit a part of its
tithes to the bishop of the diocese. Under the influence of feudal ideas
the tithes of a parish could be enfeoffed, mortgaged, bequeathed, or
sold like any other property or revenue, so that by the twelfth century
a financial web had been woven in which the local church and its priest
were rather the collectors than the con- sumers of its tithes. The
priest was expected to “curse for his tithes,” as the English put it —
to excommunicate those who shirked or falsified their re- turns; for men
were as reluctant then to pay tithes to the Church, whose functions they
considered vital to their salvation, as men are now to pay taxes to the
state. We hear of occasional revolts of the tithepayers: in Reggio
Emilia in 1280, says Fra Salimbene, the citizens, defying
excommunication and interdict, promised one another “that none should
pledge the clergy any tithe . . . nor sit at meat with them . . . nor gi
ve them eat or drink”— an excom- munication in reverse; and the bishop
was compelled to compromise. 137</p>
<p>The basic revenue of the Church was from her own lands. These she
had</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>7 66</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>received through gift or bequest, through purchase or defaulted
mortgage, or through reclamation of waste lands by monastic or other
ecclesiastic groups. In the feudal system each owner or tenant was
expected to leave something to the Church at death; those who did not
were suspected of heresy, and might be refused burial in consecrated
ground. 138 Since only a few of the laity could write, a priest was
usually called in to draft the wills; Pope Alexander III decreed in 1170
that no one could make a valid will ex- cept in presence of a priest;
any secular notary who drew up a will except under these conditions was
to be excommunicated; 139 and the Church had exclusive jurisdiction over
the probate of wills. Gifts or legacies to the Church were held to be
the most dependable means of telescoping the pains of purgatory. Many
bequests to the Church, especially before the year xooo, began with the
words adventmte mundi vespero — “since the evening of the world is
near.” 140 Some owners, as we have seen, gave their property to the
Church in precarium as disability insurance: the Church provided an an-
nuity, and care in sickness and old age, to the donor, and received the
prop- erty free of lien at his death. 141 Some monasteries, by
“confraternities,” gave</p>
<p>As the property of the Church was inalienable, and, before 1200, was
normally free from secular taxation, 143 it grew from century to
century. It was not unusual for a cathedral, a monastery, or a nunnery
to own several thousand manors, including a dozen towns or even a great
city or two. 144 The bishop of Langres owned the whole county; the abbey
of St. Martin of Tours ruled over 20,000 serfs; the bishop of Bologna
held 2000 manors; so did the abbey of Lorsch; the abbey of Las Huelgas,
in Spain, held sixty- four townships. 145 In Castile, about 1 200, the
Church owned a quarter of the soil; in England a fifth; in Germany a
third; in Livonia one half; 146 these, however, are loose and uncertain
estimates. Such accumulations became the envy and target of the state.
Charles Martel confiscated church property to finance his wars; Louis
the Pious legislated against bequests that disinherited the children of
the testator in favor of the Church; 147 Henry II of Germany stripped
many monasteries of their lands, saying that monks were vowed to
poverty; and several English statutes of mortmain put restrictions on
the deeding of property to “corporations”— meaning ecclesiastical
bodies. Ed- ward I levied from the English Church in 1291 a tenth of its
property, and in 1294 a half of its annual revenue. Philip II began,
St. Louis continued, Philip IV established, the taxation of
ecclesiastical property in France. As</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII ) THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH j6j</p>
<p>industry and commerce developed, and money multiplied and prices
rose, the income of abbeys and bishoprics, derived largely from feudal
dues once fixed at a low-price level and now hard to raise, proved
inadequate not only for luxury but even for maintenance. 148 By 1270 the
majority of French cathedrals and abbeys were heavily in debt; they had
borrowed from the bankers at high interest rates to meet the exactions
of the kings; hence, in part, the decline of architectural activity in
France at the end of the thir- teenth century.</p>
<p>The popes added to the impoverishment of bishoprics by taxing their
property and revenues first to finance the Crusades, later to pay the
mount- ting expenses of the papal see. New sources of central income
became necessary as the papacy widened the area and complexity of its
functions. Innocent III (1199) directed all bishops to send to the See
of Peter yearly a fortieth of their revenue. A cens or tax was levied
upon all monasteries, con- vents, and churches that came directly under
papal protection. “An annate” — theoretically the who le, actually half,
the first year’s revenue of a newly elected bishop — was required by the
popes as a fee forconfirming his appoint- ment; and large sums were
expected from recipients of the archiepiscopal pallium. All Christian
households were asked to send an annual penny (some 90 cents) to the
Roman See as “Peter’s Pence.” Normally fees were charged for litigation
brought to the papal court. The popes claimed the power to dispense in
certain cases from canon law, as in permitting consanguineous marriage
where some good political end seemed to justify the deviation; and fees
were charged for legal processes involved in such dispensations. Consid-
erable sums came to the popes from the recipients of papal indulgences,
and from pilgrims to Rome. It has been calculated that the total income
of the papal see about 1 2 50 was greater than the combined revenues of
all the secu- lar sovereigns of Europe. 149 From England in 1252 the
papacy received a sum thrice the revenue of the crown. 130</p>
<p>The wealth of the Church, however proportionate to the extent of its
functions, was the chief source of heresy in this age. Arnold of Brescia
pro- claimed that any priest or monk who died possessing property would
surely go to hell. 131 The Bogomiles, the Waldenses, the Paterines, the
Cathari made headway by denouncing the wealth of the followers of
Christ. A favorite satire in the thirteenth century was the “Gospel
According to Marks of Silver,” which began: “In those days the Pope said
to the Romans: ‘When the Son of Man shall come to the seat of our
majesty say first of all, “Friend, wherefore art Thou come hither?” And
if He give you naught, cast Him forth into outer darkness.’” 152
Throughout the literature of the time— in the fabliaux, the chansons de
geste, the Roman de la Rose, the poems of the wandering scholars, the
troubadours, Dante, even in the monastic chroni- clers, we find
complaints of ecclesiastical avarice or wealth. 133 Matthew Paris, an
English monk, denounced the venality of English and Roman prel-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>ates “living daintily on the patrimony of Christ”; 154 Hubert de
Romans, head of the Dominican order, wrote of “pardoners corrupting with
bribes the prelates of the ecclesiastical courts”; 155 Petrus Cantor, a
priest, told of priests who sold Masses or Vespers; 156 Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury, declaimed against the papal chancery as bought
and sold, and quoted Henry II as boasting that he had the whole college
of cardinals in his pay. 157 Charges of corruption have been made
against every government in history; they are nearly always partly true,
and partly exaggerated from startling instances; but at times they rise
to a revolutionary resentment. The same parishioners who built
cathedrals to Mary with their pennies could protest angrily against the
collective propensities of the Church, and occasionally they murdered a
pertinacious priest. 158</p>
<p>The Church herself joined in this criticism of clerical
money-grubbing, and made many efforts to control the acquisitiveness and
luxury of her per- sonnel. Hundreds of clergymen, from St. Peter Damian,
St. Bernard, St. Francis, and Cardinal de Vitry down to simple monks,
labored to mitigate these natural abuses; 159 it is chiefly from the
writings of such ecclesiastical reformers that our knowledge of the
abuses is derived. A dozen monastic orders devoted themselves to
preaching reform by their good example. Pope Alexander III and the
Lateran Council of 1179 condemned the exaction of fees for administering
baptism or extreme unction, or performing a marriage; and Gregory X
called the Ecumenical Council of Lyons in 1274 specifically to take
measures for the reform of the Church. The popes themselves, in this
age, showed no taste for luxury, and earned their keep by arduous
devotion to their exhausting tasks. It is the tragedy of things
spiritual that they lan- guish if unorganized, and are contaminated by
the material needs of their organization.</p>
