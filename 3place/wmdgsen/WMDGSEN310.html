<p>i 300-1 516</p>
<p>I. SECOND BLOOMING IN BYZANTIUM: I261-I373</p>
<p>T HE Byzantine Empire, bloodlessly restored under a new Palaeologus
dynasty in 1261, survived despite itself for almost two centuries. Its
territory was reduced by the advance of the Moslems in Asia and Europe,
by the expansion of the Slavs in its rear, and by scattered fragments of
its former self retained by the Christian enemies who had sacked
Constantinople in 1204 — Normans, Venetians, and Genoese. Industry
lingered in the towns of the Empire, but its products were carried in
Italian vessels that paid no revenue into the treasury. Of the once
numerous middle class only a fringe remained. Above it were luxurious
nobles and prelates gorgeously garbed, who had learned nothing from
history and had forgotten everything but their privileges. Below were
turbulent layers of monks who salted piety with politics, and peasant
proprietors lapsing into tenancy, and tenant farmers slipping into
serfdom, and proletaires dreaming of egalitarian utopias. A rev- olution
at Salonika (1341) expelled the aristocracy, pillaged palaces, and set
up a semi-communistic republic that ruled for eight years before it was
sup- pressed by troops from the capital. 1 Constantinople was still a
bustling nexus of commerce, but a Moslem traveler in 1330 noted “many
destroyed houses, and sown fields within the city walls”; and the
Spanish diplomat Ruy Gon - zalez de Clavijo, about 1409, wrote:
“Everywhere throughout the capital are great palaces, churches, and
monasteries, but most of them are in ruins.” 2 The glory had departed
from the Queen of the Bosporus.</p>
<p>Amid this political decay the ever-cherished heritage of ancient
Greek lit- erature and philosophy combined with the Byzantine-Oriental
tradition in architecture and painting to compose the cultural swan song
of the Eastern Roman Empire. The schools still expounded Plato,
Aristotle, and Zeno the Stoic, though they shunned Epicurus as an
atheist; and scholars revised and commented upon classical texts.
Maximus Planudes, Byzantine envoy to Ven- ice, edited the Greek
Anthology, translated Latin classics into Greek, and rebuilt a cultural
bridge between Byzantium and Italy. The career of Theo- doras Metochites
illustrates this Palaeologian Renaissance. Prime minister to Andronicus
II, he was at the same time one of the most learned and prolific</p>
<p>*75</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xscholars of his time. Nicephoras Gregoras, himself savant and
historian, wrote of him: “From morning to evening he was wholly and
eagerly devoted to public affairs, as if scholarship were quite
irrelevant to him; but late in the evening, after having left the
palace, he became absorbed in studies to as high a degree as if he were
a scholar with absolutely no connection with any other interest.” 8
Theodor as composed history, poetry, astronomy, and phi- losophy, of an
excellence unmatched by any Greek of that fourteenth cen- tury. In the
revolution that dethroned his master, he forfeited position, fortune,
and home, and was cast into prison; but, falling ill, he was allowed to
end his days in the monastery of St. Saviour “in Chora” (i.e., in the
fields), whose walls he had ennobled with some of the fairest mosaics in
Byzantine history.</p>
<p>In philosophy the old contest between Platonists and Aristotelians
re- captured the stage. Emperor John VI Cantacuzene defended Aristotle,
while Plato remained the god of Gemistus Pletho. This most renowned of
the new Greek Sophists studied philosophy at Brusa in Asia Minor, when
that city was already the capital of the Ottoman advance. From a Jewish
teacher there he learned the lore of the Zoroastrians; and when he
returned to his native Peloponnesus — then renamed Morea — he had
probably abandoned the Chris- tian faith. Settling down at Mistra, he
became both a judge and a professor. In 1400 he wrote a treatise bearing
Plato’s title, The Laws, in which he pro - posed the replacement of both
Christianity and Mohammedanism by the religion of ancient Greece, merely
transforming all the Olympians but Zeus into symbolic personifications
of creative processes or ideas; Pletho did not know that religions are
born, not made. Nevertheless pupils gathered around him eagerly; one of
them, Johannes Bessarion, was destined to become a humanist cardinal in
Italy. Both Gemistus and Bessarion accompanied Em- peror John VIII to
Ferrara and Florence (1438) to attend the council in which the Greek and
Roman churches were for a moment reconciled in theology and politics. At
Florence Gemistus lectured on Plato to an elite audience, and almost
touched off the Italian Renaissance. It was there that he added the
cognomen Pletho (complete) to his name, playing upon both gemistos
(full) and Platon. Returning to Mistra he subsided theologically, became
an archbishop, and died at ninety-five (1450).</p>
<p>The revival of art was as marked as the rejuvenation of letters. The
themes and figures were still ecclesiastical; but now and then a touch
of landscape, a breath of naturalism, a new warmth of color and line
gave life to the mosaics. Those recently uncovered in the Chora
monastery (the Kahriye-Jami Mosque) have so much vitality that Western
historians profess to see in them some fresh Italian influence. In the
frescoes that increasingly replaced ex- pensive mosaics in the
decoration of churches and palaces, the ecclesiastical hold relaxed, and
figures of vivid fantasy and secular story appeared beside</p>
<p>THE OTTOMAN TIDE</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>he legends of the saints. The icon-makers, however, clung to the old
hieratic style — forms thinned, faces burning with a puritanic piety
strikingly absent from the morals of the time. Byzantine miniature
painting suffered now a sharp decline, but the weaving of pictorial
designs into silk still produced masterpieces unrivaled in the Western
world. The so- called “Dalmatic of Charlemagne” dates from the
fourteenth or fifteenth century; on a base of blue-dyed silk an artist
designed, a skillful artisan wove in silk threads of silver and gold,
scenes from the life of Mary, Christ, and divers saints. Similar
splendors of textile painting took form in this age in Salonika, Serbia,
Moldavia, and Russia.</p>
<p>Greece was now again a center of great art. As the thirteenth century
neared its end the Franks who had dotted the classic sites with
picturesque castles made way for the revived Byzantine power. In 1 348
the Emperor John VI sent his son Manuel to be despotes of the Morea. He
established his provincial seat on a hill overlooking the ancient
Sparta. To the new capital came nobles, patrons, monks, artists,
scholars, and philosophers. Magnificent monasteries were built, and
three of them have kept in their churches some of their medieval
frescoes: the Metropolis and Peribleptos abbeys from the fourteenth
century, the Pantanassa from the early fifteenth. These are the finest
murals in the long history of Byzantine art. In their precise draftsman-
ship, in the flowing grace of their figures, in the depth and glow of
their colors, they compare with the best frescoes of the same period in
Italy; in- deed, they may owe some of their novel grace to Cimabue,
Giotto, or Duccio — who all owed so much to Byzantium.</p>
<p>On the eastern coast of Greece, high on the promontory of Mount
Athos, monasteries had been raised in the tenth century, and in most
centuries since: in the fourteenth the majestic Pantocrator, in the
fifteenth St. Paul’s. Of the murals in these retreats an
eighteenth-century Greek Guide to Painting as- cribed the best to Manuel
Panselinos of Salonika, who “showed such bril - liance and skill in his
art that he was raised above all painters ancient or modern.” 4 But of
Manuel’s dates or works t here is no certainty; he may have belonged to
the eleventh or the sixteenth century; and no one can say which of the
paintings on Mount Athos are from his hand.</p>
<p>While Byzantine art experienced this final ecstasy, the Byzantine
govern- ment declined. The army was in disorder, the navy in decay;
Genoese or Venetian vessels controlled the Black Sea, and pirates roamed
the Greek archipelago. A band of mercenaries from Catalonia — the
“Catalan Grand Company”— captured Gallipoli (1306), mulcted the commerce
of the Dar- danelles, and set up a republic of robbers in Athens (1310);
no government succeeded in suppressing them, and they Avere left to be
consumed by their own violence. In 1 307 Pope Clement V joined France,
Naples, and Venice in a plot to recapture Constantinople. The plot fell
apart, but for many years</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xhe Byzantine emperors were so fearful of the Christian West that
they had no energy or courage to resist the Moslem advance. When that
fear sub- sided the Ottoman Turks were at the door.</p>
<p>Some of the emperors bought their own destruction. In 1342 John VI
Cantacuzene, involved in civil war, asked aid of Orkhan, Sultan of the
Otto- mans; Orkhan sent him ships and helped him take Salonika; the
grateful Emperor gave him his daughter Theodora as an extra wife; the
Sultan sent him 6,000 additional troops. When John Palaeologus undertook
to depose him, John Cantacuzene robbed the churches of Constantinople to
pay Ork- han for 20,000 more Turks, and promised the Sultan a fortress
in the Thracian Chersonese. In the hour of his apparent victory the
people of Constantinople turned against him as a traitor, and revolution
transformed him overnight from an emperor into an historian (1355). He
retired to a monastery, and wrote the history of his times as a last
attempt to overwhelm his enemies.</p>
<p>John V Palaeologus found no ease on the throne. He went to Rome as a
suppliant (1369), and offered, in return for help against the Turks, to
bring his people into obedience to the papacy. Before the high altar of
St. Peter’s he abjured the Greek Orthodox Church. Pope Urban V promised
aid against the infidels, and gave him letters to the princes of
Christendom. But these were busy with other affairs. Instead of
receiving assistance, John was held at Venice as a hostage for the
payment of Greek debts. His son Manuel brought the money; John returned
to Constantinople poorer than before, and was denounced by his people
for forswearing the Orthodox creed. Fail- ing in a second attempt to get
succor from the West, he recognized Sultan Murad I as his suzerain,
agreed to provide military aid to the Ottoman army, and gave his beloved
Manuel as hostage for the fulfillment of his pledge. 5 Appeased for the
moment, Murad spared Byzantium, and turned to sub- jugate the
Balkans.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE BALKANS MEET THE TURKS: 1300-96</li>
</ol>
<p>Hitherto the fourteenth century had been for the Balkans a peak in
their history. In Wallachia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia, and Albania hardy
Slavs cut the forests, mined and tilled the earth, pastured flocks, and
eagerly bred their own replacements. From the Adriatic to the Black Sea,
from the Black Sea to the Baltic, Slavs, Italians, Magyars, Bulgars,
Greeks, and Jews carried the trade of East and West, and cities sprouted
in their path.</p>
<p>The great man of Serbia in this century was Stephen Dushan. His
father, Stephen Urosh III, begot him in a brief detour from monogamy,
gave him the affectionate name Dusha — i.e., Soul — and had him crowned
as heir ap-</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) THE OTTOMAN TIDE 179</p>
<p>parent. When a more legitimate son arrived, and received fond
nicknames in his turn, Stephen deposed his father, allowed him to be
strangled, and ruled Serbia with a strong hand for a generation. “Of all
the men of his time,” wrote a contemporary, he was “the tallest, and
terrible to look upon.” 8 Serbia forgave him everything, for he waged
successful war. He trained a large army, led it with masterly
generalship, conquered Bosnia, Albania, Epirus, Acarnania, Aetolia,
Macedonia, Thessaly. Transferring his capital from Belgrade to Skoplje,
he convened there a parliament of nobles, and bade it unify and codify
the laws of his diverse states; the resultant Zabonik Tsar a Dushana, or
Lawbook of Czar Dushan (1349), revealed a level of legal de- velopment
and civilized usage not far below that of Western Europe. Fi- nanced and
perhaps stimulated by this political exaltation, Serbian art in the
fourteenth century rivaled the contemporary flourish in Constantinople
and the Morea; magnificent churches were built, and their mosaics were
freer and livelier than those normally allowed by the more conservative
ec- clesiasticism of the Greek capital. In 1355 Dushan assembled his
armies for the last time. He asked them whether they preferred to be led
against By- zantium or Hungary. They answered that they would follow him
wherever he chose to lead. “To Constantinople!” he cried. On the way he
fell sick and died.</p>
<p>His empire was too heterogeneous to be held together except by a man
of alert intelligence and disciplined energy. Bosnia seceded, and
attained for a proud moment, under Stephen Trtko, the hegemony of the
Balkans. Bul- garia under John Alexander had its last great age.
Wallachia, once part of the Byzantine Empire, detached itself (
c. 1290), and ruled the spreading delta of the Danube. Moldavia threw
off its allegiance to Hungary (1349).</p>
<p>Upon these centrifugal statelets the Turkish blight fell even before
John V Palaeologus made Byzantium vassal to Murad I. Suleiman, the
dashing son of Sultan Orkhan, had led Turkish troops to the aid of John
VI Can- tacuzene; he received, or took, as his reward the fortress of
Tzympe on the European side of the Dardanelles (1353). When an
earthquake shattered the walls of near-by Gallipoli, Suleiman moved into
the defenseless town. At his invitation Turkish colonists crossed from
Anatolia and spread along the northern coast of the Sea of Marmora
almost to Constantinople itself. With an expanding Turkish army Suleiman
marched into Thrace and cap- tured Adrianople (1361). Five years later
Murad made it his European capital. From that center the Turks would for
a century aim their blows at the divided Balkans.</p>
<p>Pope Urban V, recognizing the significance of this Turkish
infiltration into Europe, called upon all Christendom for another
crusade. An army of Serbs, Hungarians, and Wallachians marched gallantly
toward Adrianople. At the river Maritsa they celebrated their unresisted
advance with a feast.</p>
<p>l8o THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>XAmid their cups and revelry they were surprised by a night assault
from a relatively small Turkish force. Many were slain before they could
arm; many were drowned trying to retreat across the river; the rest fled
(1371). In 1 385 Sofia capitulated, and half of Bulgaria fell to the
Ottomans. In 1386 they took Nish, in 1387 Salonika. All Greece lay open
to the Turks.</p>
<p>For one heroic year little Bosnia stemmed the tide. Stephen Trtko
joined his forces with the Serbians under Lazar I, and defeated the
Turks at Ploch- nik (1388). A year later Murad marched west with an army
that included many Christian contingents. At Kosovo he was met by a
coalition of Serbs, Bosnians, Magyars, Vlachs, Bulgars, Albanians, and
Poles. A Serb knight, Milosh Kobilich, pretending to be a deserter and
informer, made his way into Murad’s tent, killed the Sultan, and was
hacked to death. Murad’s son and heir, Bajazet I, rallied the Turks to
angry courage, and led them to vic- tory. King Lazar was captured and
beheaded; Serbia became a tribute-pay- ing vassal of the Turks, and its
new king, Stephen Lazarevitch, was compelled to send arms and men to
Bajazet. In 1392 Wallachia under John Shishman joined the roster of
Balkan states tributary to the Ottomans. Only Bulgaria and Byzantium
remained capable of defense.</p>
<p>In 1393 Bajazet invaded Bulgaria. After a siege of three months
Tmovo, the capital, fell; the churches were desecrated, the palaces were
set on fire, the leading nobles were invited to a conference and were
massacred. The Pope again appealed to Christendom, and King Sigismund of
Hungary sum- moned Europe to arms. France, though engaged in a
life-and-death struggle with England, sent a force of cavaliers under
the Count of Nevers; the Count of Hohenzollern and the Grand Master of
the Knights of St. John came with their followers; the Elector Palatine
brought a company of Bavarian horse; John Shishman renounced his
vassalage and came with his troops to fight under the Hungarian
King.</p>
<p>The united army, 60,000 strong, marched through Serbia and besieged
the Turkish garrison in Nicopolis. Warned that Bajazet, with an army
from Asia, was coming to raise the siege, the French knights, gay with
wine and women, promised to annihilate it, and boasted that if the sky
should fall they would hold it up with their spears. For his part
Bajazet vowed that he would stable his horse at the high altar of
St. Peter’s in Rome. 7 He placed his weakest troops in front, with
strategy that should have been obvious. The French knights plunged
through them triumphantly, then through 10,000 Janis- saries, then
through 5,000 Turkish cavalry, then charged recklessly up a hill. Just
beyond its summit they found themselves faced by the main body of the
Turkish army — 40,000 lancers. The nobles fought nobly, were killed or
captured or put to flight, and the allied infantry behind them were dis-
ordered by their rout. The Hungarians and Germans were nevertheless
driv- ing back the Turks when Stephen Lazarevitch of Serbia led 5,000
Christians</p>

<p>CHAP. IX )</p>
<p>against the Christian army, and won the crucial battle of Nicopolis
for the Sultan (1396).</p>
<p>Maddened by the sight of so many of his men lying dead on the field,
and by the claim of the rescued garrison that the Christian besiegers
had killed their Turkish prisoners, Bajazet ordered the 10,000 captives
to be put to death. The Count of Nevers was allowed to choose
twenty-four knights to be saved for the ransom they might bring. Several
thousand Christians were slaughtered in a bloody ritual that went on
from sunrise to late afternoon, until the Sultan’s officers persuaded
him to spare the rest. 8 From that day till 1878 Bulgaria was a province
of the Ottoman Empire. Bajazet now took most of Greece, and then marched
against Constantinople.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE LAST YEARS OF CONSTANTINOPLE: I373-I453</li>
</ol>
<p>No other government ever so fully deserved to fall as the Byzantine.
Hav- ing lost the will to defend itself, and unable to persuade the too
sophisticated Greeks that it is sweet and noble to die for one’s
country, it sent no contin - gent to the Christian armies at the
Maritsa, Kosovo, or Nicopolis. It pro- vided 12,000 soldiers for the
Sultan in 1379; and it was Byzantine troops that, on the order of John
VII Palaeologus, compelled the Byzantine city of Philadelphia, in Asia
Minor, to surrender to the Turks (1390).</p>
<p>When Bajazet resumed the siege of Constantinople ( 1402), the
Byzantine Empire was reduced to its capital: Bajazet commanded both
coasts of the Sea of Marmora, controlled the Dardanelles, ruled nearly
all of Asia Minor and the Balkans, and passed safely between his Asiatic
and European capi- tals. The final hour seemed to have struck for the
beleaguered city. Starving Greeks let themselves down over the walls,
and deserted to the Turks in order to eat. Suddenly from the Moslem East
an “infidel” savior appeared for the outpost of Christendom. Timur the
Lame — Tamerlane the Great — had determined to check the growth and
insolence of Ottoman power. As the Tatar hordes rolled west Bajazet
abandoned the siege of Constantinople, and hurried to regroup his forces
in Anatolia. Turks met Tatars at Ankara (1402); Bajazet was defeated and
captured. The Turkish tide ebbed for a generation; God at last seemed to
be on the side of the Christians.</p>
<p>Under the wise rule of Manuel II Byzantium recovered most of Greece
and parts of Thrace. But Mohammed I reorganized the Turkish army, and
Murad II led it, after a major defeat, to major victories. The Moslems
still drew inspiration from the belief that to die for Islam was to win
paradise; even if there should be no paradise and no houris, they were
impartial enough to consider the Greek maidens beautiful. The Christians
were not so im- partial. Greek Catholics hated Roman Catholics and were
hated in turn.</p>
<p>I “ 2 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XWhen Venetians hunted and massacred Greek Catholics in Crete for re-
fusing to accept the Roman ritual and papal supremacy, Pope Urban V
joined Petrarch in congratulating the doge on his firm protection of the
one true Church ( c. 13 50). 9 The populace and lower clergy of
Byzantium re- pudiated all attempts to reunite Greek with Latin
Christianity; and a By- zantine noble declared that he would rather see
the Turkish turban at Constantinople than the red hat of a Roman
cardinal. 10 Most Balkan states hated their neighbors more than the
Turks, and some preferred to submit to the Moslems, who taxed no more
than the Christian rulers, persecuted heresy less or not at all , 11 and
allowed four wives.</p>
<p>In 1422 Murad II renewed the attack upon Constantinople. A revolt in
the Balkans compelled him to abandon the siege, and John VIII
Palaeologus was allowed to reign in relative peace on condition of
paying a heavy annual tribute to the Turks. Murad reconquered Greece,
Salonika, and most of Albania. Serbia resisted manfully under George
Brankovic; a combined army of Serbians and Hungarians under Hunyadi
Janos defeated Murad at Kuno- vitza (1444), and Brankovic ruled Serbia
till his death at the age of ninety ( 1456). After victories at Varna
and in the second battle of Kosovo ( 1448) , Murad signed a peace with
the Emperor Constantine XI Palaeologus, and retired to Adrianople to die
(1451).</p>
<p>Mohammed II, surnamed the Conqueror, came to the Ottoman throne at
twenty-one. Pie confirmed the treaty with Constantine, and sent his
nephew Orkhan to be brought up (possibly as a spy) at the Byzantine
court. When other Moslem powers challenged his authority in Western
Asia, Mo- hammed ferried his army across the Straits, and left his
European possessions in charge of the Vizier Khalil Pasha, known for
friendliness to Byzantium. Constantine had more courage than wit; he
informed the Vizier that unless the pension paid for the care of
Mohammed’s nephew should be doubled, Orkhan would be put forward by
Byzantium as a claimant to the Ottoman throne. 12 Apparently Constantine
thought that the revolt in Asia offered an opportunity to weaken the
Turks in Europe. But he had neglected to secure either his alliances in
the west or his communications to the south. Moham- med made peace with
his Moslem enemies, and with Venice, Wallachia, Bosnia, and Hungary.
Crossing back to Europe, he raised a powerful fortress on the Bosporus
above Constantinople, thereby ensuring the unimpeded pas- sage of his
troops between the continents, and controlling all commerce entering the
Black Sea. For eight months he gathered materials and men. He hired
Christian gunsmiths to cast for him the largest cannon yet known, which
would hurl stone balls weighing 600 pounds. In June 1 45 2 , he declared
war, and began the final siege of Constantinople with 140,000 men.
13</p>
<p>Constantine led the defense with desperate resolution. He equipped
his 7,000 soldiers with small cannon, lances, bows and arrows, flaming
torches,</p>

<p>I8 3</p>
<p>and crude firearms discharging leaden bullets of a walnut’s size.
Sleeping only by snatches, he supervised, every night, the repair of the
damage done to the walls during the day. Nevertheless the ancient
defenses crumbled more and more before the battering rams and superior
artillery of the Turks; now ended the medieval fortification of cities
by walls. On May 29 the Turks fought their way across a moat filled with
the bodies of their own slain, and surged over or through the walls into
the terrorized city. The cries of the dying were drowned in the martial
music of trumpets and drums. The Greeks at last fought bravely; the
young Emperor was everywhere in the heat of the action, and the nobles
who were with him died to a man in his defense. Surrou nded by Turks, he
cried out, “Cannot there be found a Christian to cut off my head?” He
threw off his imperial garments, fought as a common soldier, disappeared
in the rout of his little army, and was never heard of again.</p>
<p>The victors massacred thousands, till all defense ceased. Then they
began that rampant plunder which had so long been the substance of their
hopes. Every usable adult among the defeated was taken as a prize; nuns
were ravished like other women in an impartial mania of rape; Christian
masters and servants, shorn of the garb that marked their state, found
themselves suddenly equalized in indiscriminate slavery. Pillage was not
quite uncon- trolled; when Mohammed II found a Moslem piously destroying
the marble pavement of St. Sophia, he smote him with the royal scimitar,
and announced that all buildings were to be reserved for orderly rapine
by the Sultan. St. Sophia was transformed into a mosque after proper
purification; all its Chris- tian insignia were removed, and its mosaics
were whitewashed into oblivion for 500 years. On the very day of the
city’s fall, or on the ensuing Friday, a muezzin mounted the tallest
turret of Hagia Sophia and summoned the Mos- lems to gather in it for
prayer to victorious Allah. Mohammed II performed the Moslem ritual in
Christendom’s most famous shrine.</p>
<p>The capture of Constantinople shook every throne in Europe. The bul-
wark had fallen that had protected Europe from Asia for over a thousand
years. That Moslem power and faith which the Crusaders had hoped to
drive back into inner Asia had now made its way over the corpse of
Byzantium, and through the Balkans to the very gates of Hungary. The
papacy, which had dreamed of all Greek Christianity submitting to the
rule of Rome, saw with dismay the rapid conversion of millions of
southeastern Europeans to Islam. Routes of commerce once open to Western
vessels were now in alien hands, and could be clogged with tolls in
peace or closed with guns in war. Byzantine art, exiled from home, found
refuge in Russia, while in the West its influence disappeared with its
pride. The migration of Greek scholars to Italy and France, which had
begun in 1397, was now accelerated, fructifying Italy with the salvage
of ancient Greece. In one sense nothing was lost; only</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

place, in the heroic and sanguinary, noble and ignominious procession of
mankind.</p>

<li>HUNYADI JANOS: 1387-1456</li>
</ol>
<p>The population of Hungary, numbering some 700,000 in the fourteenth
century, was a fluctuating mixture of Magyars, Pannonians, Slovaks,
Bulgars, Khazars, Patzinaks, Cumans, Slavonians, Croats, Russians,
Armenians, Wal- lachians, Bosnians, and Serbs: in summary, a minority of
Magyars ruling a majority of Slavs. In the nascent cities a mercantile
middle class and an industrial proletariat began to form in the
fourteenth century; and as these were mostly immigrants from Germany,
Flanders, and Italy, new racial ten- sions were added to the ethnic
maze.</p>
<p>When Andrew III died, ending the Arpad dynasty (907-1 301), a war of
succession further divided the nation, and peace returned only when the
higher nobility, having made the monarchy elective, conferred the crown
of St. Stephen upon Charles Robert of Anjou (1308). Charles brought with
him French ideas of feudalism and chivalry, Italian ideas of business
and in- dustry. He promoted the development of Hungary’s gold mines,
encour- aged enterprise, stabilized the currency, cleansed the
judiciary, and gave the nation a competent administration. Under Charles
and his son Louis, Hun- gary became a Western state, eager to win the
help of the West against the proliferating East.</p>
<p>Louis I, wrote Voltaire, “reigned happily in Hungary forty years” ( 1
342 -</p>
<p>82), and (not so happily) “in Poland twelve years. His people gave
him the surname of the Great, which he well deserved; and yet this
prince is hardly known in [Western] Europe, because he did not reign
over men capable of transmitting his fame and virtues to other nations.
How few know that in the fourteenth century there was a Louis the Great
in the Carpathian Moun- tains!” 14 His character mingled urban e culture
and chivalrous sentiments with military ardor and capacity. He indulged
occasionally in wars — to avenge his murdered brother in Naples, to
recover from Venice the Dalma- tian ports that had long seemed to
Hungary its due outlets to the sea, and to check the aggressive
expansion of Serbia and Turkey by bringing Croatia, Bosnia, and northern
Bulgaria under Hungarian control. By example and precept he spread the
chivalric ideal among the nobility, and raised the level of manners and
morals in his people. During his reign and that of his father, Hungarian
Gothic achieved its finest embodiments, and Nicholas Kolozsvari and his
sons carved such notable statuary as the St. George now in Prague. In
1367 Louis founded the University of Pecs; but this, along with much
of</p>
<p>CHAP.n) the ottoman tide 185</p>
<p>Hungary’s medieval glory, disappeared in the long and exhausting
struggle with the Turks.</p>
<p>Louis’s son -in-law, Sigismund I, enjoyed a reign whose length

<ol start="1437" type="1">
<li>should have made possible long-term and farsighted policies. But his
tasks were greater than his powers. He led a huge army against Bajazet
at Nicopolis, and barely escaped from that disaster with his life. He
realized that the Turkish advance was now the paramount problem of
Europe; he devoted great care and failing funds to fortifying the
southern frontier, and built at the junction of the Danube and the Save
the great fortress of Bel- grade. But his election to the Imperial
office compelled him to neglect Hun- gary during long absences in
Germany; and his acquisition of the Bohemian crown widened his
responsibilities without enlarging his capacities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two years after his death the spreading Turks invaded Hungary. In
this crisis the nation produced its most famous hero. Hunyadi Janos
received his surname from the castle of Hunyadi in Transylvania, a
stronghold granted to his father for services in war. Janos — i.e., John
— was trained for war almost daily in his youth. He distinguished
himself in a victory over the Turks at Semendria, and the new king,
Ladislas V, made him commander-in-chief of the armies resisting the
Turks. The repulse of the Ottomans became the ab- sorbing devotion of
his career. When they entered Transylvania he led against them newly
disciplined troops inspired by his patriotism and his gen- eralship. It
was in that battle that Simon Kemeny, beloved in Hungarian literature,
gave his life for his leader. Knowing that the Turks had been in-
structed to seek out and kill Hunyadi, Simon begged and received permis-
sion to exchange costumes with him. He died under concentrated assaults,
while Hunyadi directed the army to victory (1442). Murad II dispatched
80,000 new troops to the front; Hunyadi lured them, by feigned retreat,
into a narrow pass where only a fraction of them could fight at one
time; and again Hunyadi’s strategy triumphed. Harassed by revolts in
Asia, Murad sued for terms, and agreed to pay a substantial indemnity.
At Szeged, King Ladislas and his allies signed with Murad’s
representatives a truce pledging both sides to peace. Ladislas swore on
the Bible, the Turkish ambassadors on the Koran (1442).</p>
<p>But Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini, papal legate at Buda, presently
judged the time propitious for an offensive. Murad had moved his army to
Asia; an Italian fleet, controlling the Dardanelles, could prevent its
return. The Cardi- nal, who had distinguished himself for probity and
ability, argued that a pledge to an infidel could not bind a Christian.
18 Hunyadi advised peace, and the Serbian contingent refused to violate
the truce. The envoys of the West- ern nations agreed with Cesarini, and
offered to contribute money and men to a sacred crusade. Ladislas
yielded, and in person led an attack upon Turk- ish position* The
promised reinforcements from the West did not come;</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>1 86</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xhe Ottoman army, 60,000 strong, eluded the Italian admiral, and
crossed back to Europe. At Varna near the Black Sea-his standard-bearer
holding the dishonored treaty aloft on a lance — Murad inflicted an
overwhelming defeat upon Ladislas’ 20,000 men (1444). Hunyadi counseled
retreat, the King ordered advance. Hunyadi begged him to stay in the
rear; Ladislas plunged into the van of the fight, and was killed.
Cesarini did not quite re- gain his honor by losing his life.</p>
<p>Four years later Hunyadi tried to redeem the disaster. Forcing his
way through a hostile Serbia, he met the Turks at Kosovo in a furious
engage- ment that raged for three days. The Hungarians were routed, and
Hunyadi joined them in flight. He hid for days in a marsh; starving, he
emerged, and was recognized by the Serbians, who handed him over to the
Turks. He was released on promising never to lead an army across Serbian
soil again.</p>
<p>In 1456 the Turks laid siege to Belgrade. Mohammed II aimed against
the citadel the heavy artillery that had shattered the walls of
Constantinople; Europe had never known so violent a bombardment. Hunyadi
led the de- fense with a skill and courage never forgotten in Hungarian
poetry. 16 At last, preferring the anesthesia of battle to the agonies
of starvation, the besieged rushed from the fortress, fought their way
to the Turkish cannon, and so decisively vanquished the enemy that for
sixty years thereafter Hungary was spared any Moslem attack. A few days
after this historic defense Hunyadi died of a fever in the camp. Hungary
honors him as its greatest man.</p>
<p>V. THE TIDE AT FULL: 1453-81</p>
<p>The Turks now resumed the conquest of the Balkans. Serbia finally
suc- cumbed in 1459, and remained a Turkish province till 1804. Mohammed
II took Corinth by siege, and Athens without raising a lance (1458). The
con- queror, like Caesar, gave the Athenians easy terms out of respect
for their ancestors, and displayed a cultivated interest in the
classical monuments. He could well be genial, having avenged not only
the Crusades but Marathon. Bosnia, whose port and capital, Ragusa, had
by some veneer of culture re- ceived the title of the South Slavonic
Athens, accepted Turkish rule in 1463, and adopted the Moslem faith with
an ease that startled the West.</p>
<p>The most valiant opponent of the Turks in the second half of the
fifteenth century was Scanderbeg of Albania. His real name was George of
Castriota, and he was probably of modest Slavonian lineage; but legends
precious to his people endow him with royal Epirote blood and an
adventurous youth. In his boyhood, we are told, he was given as hostage
to Murad II, and was brought up at the Adrianople court of the Ottomans.
The Sultan so liked his courage and bearing that he treated him as a son
and made him an officer</p>
<p>THE OTTOMAN TIDE</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>l8 7</p>
<p>in the Turkish army. Converted to Mohammedanism, George received the
mighty name of Iskender Bey — i.e., Alexander the Prince — which busy
time shortened to Scanderbeg. After leading the Turks in many battles
against the Christians, he repented his apostasy, and plotted escape. He
renounced Islam, seized the Albanian capital Kruja from its Turkish
governor, and pro- claimed revolt (1442). Mohammed II sent army after
army to chasten him; Scanderbeg defeated them all by the rapidity of his
military movements and the genius of his elusive strategy; finally
Mohammed, distracted by larger wars, gave him a ten-year armistice
(1461). But the Venetian Senate and Pope Pius II persuaded Scanderbeg to
break the truce and renew the war (1463). Mohammed, denouncing the
Christians as literally faithless in- fidels, returned to the siege of
Kruja. Scanderbeg defended it so tenaciously that the Sultan again
raised the siege; but amid the debris of victory Scander- beg died (
1468). Kruja surrendered in 1479, and Albania became a province of
Turkey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the insatiable Mohammed absorbed the Morea, Trebizond,
Lesbos, Negroponte (the old Euboea), and the Crimea. In 1477 one of his
armies crossed the Isonzo, ravaged northeastern Italy to within
twenty-two miles of Venice, and then, laden with booty, returned into
Serbia. Frightened Venice, which had fought long and tenaciously for its
possessions in the Aegean and the Adriatic, yielded all claim to Kruja
and Scutari, and paid an indemnity of 10,000 ducats. Western Europe,
which had failed to help Venice, denounced her for making and keeping
peace with the infidel. 17 The Turks had now reached the Adriatic, and
only the waters that Caesar had crossed in a rowboat separated them from
Italy, Rome, and the Vatican. In 1480 Mohammed sent an army across these
waters to attack the Kingdom of Naples. It took Otranto with ease,
massacred half the 22,000 inhabitants, enslaved the rest, and cut an
archbishop in two. 18 The fate of Christianity and monogamy teetered in
the scales. Ferrante of Naples ended his war with Florence, and sent his
best forces to recapture Otranto. Mohammed had entangled himself in
besieging Rhodes; amid that enterprise he died; Rhodes remained
Christian till Suleiman; the Turks left Otranto, and retired into
Albania (1481). The Ottoman tide for a moment ceased to flow.</p>

<li>THE HUNGARIAN RENAISSANCE: 1456-90</li>
</ol>
<p>In the half-century of security that Hunyadi had won for Hungary his
son Matthias Corvinus led the nation to its historic culmination.
Matthias was only sixteen at his accession, and not entirely royal in
form; his legs were too short for his trunk, so that he seemed tall only
when on a horse; however, he had the chest and arms, the strength and
courage, of a gladiator. Not long</p>
<p>1 88</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xafter his coronation he challenged to single combat a German knight
of mas- sive frame and power, who in a tournament at Buda had felled all
competi- tors; and Matthias threatened to have him executed if he failed
to fight with all his vigor and skill. The Hungarian historians assure
us that the young King, aided by the horns of this dilemma, decisively
vanquished the giant. 18 Matthias matured into a good soldier and
general, defeated the Turks wher- ever he encountered them, absorbed
Moravia and Silesia, failed to conquer Bohemia. He fought four wars
against the Emperor Frederick III, took Vienna, and annexed Austria
(1485); the first Austro-Hungarian Empire was Hungarian.</p>
<p>His victories made the monarchy transiently supreme over the
nobility; here, as in Western Europe, centralization of government was
the order of the day. At Buda, and in the King’s palace at Visegrad, his
court equaled any royal grandeur of the age; great noblemen became his
servitors; his am- bassadors were noted for the splendor of their dress,
equipage, and retinue. Matthias’ diplomacy was cunning and unscrupulous,
amiable and generous; he bought with gold what would have cost twice as
much by arms. Mean- while he found time and zest to restore every
department of the government, and to labor in person as a careful
administrator and impartial judge. Roam- ing in disguise among the
people, the soldiery, and the courts, he inspected at first hand the
behavior of his officials, and corrected incompetence and injustice
without favoritism or fear. He did what he could to protect the weak
from the strong, the peasants from their rapacious lords. While the
Church continued to claim the country as papal property, Matthias ap-
pointed and disciplined prelates, and enjoyed the furore when he made a
seven-year-old Italian lad the primate of Hungary. The merchants of Fer-
rara, with rival humor, sent the new archbishop an assortment of toys.
20</p>
<p>In 1476 Matthias married Beatrice of Aragon, and welcomed to Hungary
the gay Neapolitan spirit and refined Italian tastes of the
granddaughter of Alfonso the Magnanimous. Intercourse between Hungary
and Naples had been encouraged by the Angevin kinship of their kings,
and many men at the Buda court had been educated in Italy. Matthias
himself resembled the Italian Renaissance “despots” in his cultural
proclivities as well as his Machia - vellian statecraft. Lorenz o de’
Medici sent him two bronze reliefs by Ver - rocchio, and Lodovico il
Moro commissioned Leonardo da Vinci to paint a Madonna for the Hungarian
King, assuring the artist that “he is able to value a great picture as
few men can.” 21 Filippino Lippi tu rned out another Madonna for
Corvinus, and his pupils adorned with frescoes the royal palace at
Esztergom. An Italian sculptor made a pretty bust of Beatrice; 22
probably the famous Milanese goldsmith Caradosso designed the masterly
Calvary of Esztergom; Benedetto da Maiano carved decorations for the
palace at Buda;</p>
<p>CHAP. IX ) THE OTTOMAN TIDE 189</p>
<p>and divers Italians built the Renaissance-style tabernacle in the
parish church of the Inner City of the capital. 23</p>
<p>Nobles and prelates joined the King in supporting artists and
scholars; even the mining towns of the interior had rich men who
sublimated wealth into art. Handsome buildings, civic as well as
ecclesiastical, rose not only at Buda but at Visegrad, Tata, Esztergom,
Nagyvarad, and Vac. Hundreds of sculptors and painters ornamented these
edifices. Giovanni Dalmata made notable statues of Hunyadi Janos and
other Hungarian heroes. At Kassa a veritable school of artists formed.
There, for the high altar of the church of St. Elizabeth, “Master
Stephen” and others carved (1474 -77) an immense and complex reredos,
whose central figures are quite Italian in their refine- ment and grace.
In the parish church of Beszterczebanya another group carved in stone a
great relief, Christ in the Garden of Olives, astonishing in its careful
details and dramatic effect. A similar vigor of expression and ar-
tistry appears in the Hungarian paintings that survive from this age, as
in the Mary Visiting E lizabeth, by “Master M.S.,” now in the Budapest
Museum. 24 Almost all the art of this Hungarian heyday was destroyed or
lost in the Ottoman invasions of the sixteenth century. Some of the
statues are in Istan- bul, to which they were carried by the victorious
Turks.</p>
<p>Matthias’ interests were literary rather than artistic. Humanists,
foreign or native, were welcomed at his court, and received lucrative
sinecures in the government. Antonio Bonfini wrote a history of the
reign in a Latin modeled on Livy. Janos Vitez, Archbishop of Gran,
collected a library of ancient classics, and provided funds to send
young scholars to study Greek in Italy. One of these, Janos Pannonius,
spent seven years at Ferrara, won admission to Lorenzo’s circle at
Florence, an d, back in Hungary, astonished the court with his Latin
verses and Greek discourses. “When Pannonius spoke Greek,” wrote
Bonfini, “you would think he must have been born in Athens.” 25 Probably
in Italy alone could one find, in the last quarter of the fifteenth
century, such a galaxy of artists and scholars as received sustenance at
Matthias’ court. The Sodalitas Litteraria Danubia, founded at Buda in
1497, is among the oldest literary societies in the world. 26</p>
<p>Like his Medici contemporaries, Corvinus collected art and books. His
palace became a museum of statuary and objets d’a.rt. Tradition has it
that</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xapestries. 27 Matthias seems to have read some of the books; at
least he used Livy to induce sleep; and he wrote to a humanist: “O
scholars, how happy you are! You strive not after blood- stained glory,
nor monarchs’ crowns, but for the laurels of poetry and virtue. You are
even able to compel us to forget the tumult of war.” 28</p>
<p>The centralized power that Matthias had organized only briefly
survived his death (1490). The resurgent magnates dominated Ladislas II,
and em- bezzled revenues that should have paid the troops. The army
mutinied, the soldiers went home. Freed from taxation, the nobles wasted
their income and energies in riotous living, while Islam pressed against
the borders and a bitterly exploited peasantry seethed with revolt. In
1514 the Hungarian Diet declared a crusade against the Turks, and called
for volunteers. Peasants in great number flocked to the cross, seeing
little to choose between life and death. Finding themselves armed, the
thought spread among them, Why wait to kill distant Turks, when hated
nobles were so near? A soldier of fortune, Gyorgy Dozsa, led them in a
wild jacquerie ; they overran all Hun- gary, burning castles and
massacring all nobles — men, women, children — who fell into their
hands. The nobles called in aid from all directions, armed and paid
mercenaries, overwhelmed the disorganized peasants, and punished their
leaders with frightful torments. For two weeks Dozsa and his aides were
kept without food; then he was tied to a red-hot iron throne, a red-hot
crown was placed upon his head, a red-hot scepter forced into his hand;
and his starved companions were allowed to tear the roasted flesh from
his body while he was still conscious. From barbarism to civilization
requires a cen- tury; from civilization to barbarism needs but a
day.</p>
<p>The peasants were not slaughtered, for they were indispensable; but
the Tripartite Code (1514) decreed that “the recent rebellion… has for
all time to come put the stain of faithlessness upon the peasants, and
they have thereby forfeited their liberty, and have become subject to
their landlords in unconditional and perpetual servitude…. Every species
of property be- longs to the landlords, and the peasant has no right to
invoke justice and the law against a noble.” 29</p>
<p>Twelve years later Hungary fell to the Turks.</p>
