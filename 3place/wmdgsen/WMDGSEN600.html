<p>November 2, 1 795 — November 9, 1799</p>
<p>I. THE NEW GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>I T was composed of five bodies. First, a Council of Five Hundred
(Les Cinq Cents), empowered to propose and discuss measures, but not to
make them into laws. Second, a Council of (250) Ancients, or elders (Les
Anciens), who had to be married and forty or more years old; they were
authorized not to initiate legislation but to reject, or ratify into
law, the “resolutions” sent to them by the Five Hundred. These two
assemblies, con - stituting the Legislature (Corps Legislatif) were
subject to annual replace- ment of a third of their membership by the
vote of the electoral colleges. The executive part of the government was
the Directory (Directoire), com- posed of five members, at least forty
years of age, chosen for a five-year term by the Ancients from fifty
names submitted by the Five Hundred. Each year one of the directors was
to be replaced by the choice of a new member. Independent of these three
bodies and of each other were the judiciary and the Treasury, chosen by
the electoral colleges of the departments. It was a government of checks
and balances, designed for the protection of the vic- torious
bourgeoisie from an unruly populace.</p>
<p>The Directory, lodged in the Luxembourg Palace, soon became the domi-
nant branch of the government. It controlled the Army and Navy and de-
termined foreign policy; it supervised the ministers of the interior, of
foreign affairs, of marine and colonies, of war and finance. By the
natural centripetal tendency by which power flows to leadership, the
Directory became a dic- tatorship almost as independent as the Committee
of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The five men first chosen as directors were Paul Barras, Louis-Marie
de Larevelliere-Lepaux, Jean-Frangois Rewbell, Charles Letourneur, and
La- zare Carnot. All of these had been regicides, four had been
Jacobins, one — Barras — had been a viscount; now they adjusted
themselves to a bourgeois regime. All were men of ability, but,
excepting Carnot, they were not dis- tinguished by scrupulous integrity.
If survival is the test of worth, Barras was the most able, serving
first Louis XVI, then Robespierre, and helping both of them to their
deaths; maneuvering safely through crisis after crisis, through mistress
after mistress, gathering wealth and power at every turn, giving
Napoleon an army and a wife, outliving them, and dying in easy
circumstances in re-Bourbonized Paris at the age of seventy-four (1829);
1 he had nine lives and sold them all.</p>

<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>The problems faced by the Directory in 1795 might by their diverse
mul- titude excuse some failures of their government. The populace of
Paris was always facing destitution; the British blockade joined
conflicts within the economy to impede the movement of food and goods.
Inflation deflated the currency; in 1795 five thousand assignats were
needed to buy what a hundred had bought in 1 790. As the Treasury paid
interest on its bonds in assignats at their face value, the rentiers who
had invested in government “securities” as a protection in old age found
themselves joining the rebellious poor. 2 Thousands of Frenchmen bought
stocks in a wild race to cheat inflation; when values had been swollen
to their peak, speculators unloaded their holdings; a wild race to sell
collapsed stock prices; the innocent found that their savings had been
harvested by the clever few. The Treasury, having forfeited public
confidence, repeatedly faced bankruptcy, and declared it in</p>

will be dissolved. All their members will be immediately judged by the
people…. 1 8. Public and private property are placed in the custody of

<li>The duty of terminating the Revolution, and of bestowing upon the
Re- public liberty, equality, and the Constitution of 1793, will be

department, appointed by the insurgent people upon the nomination of the
Insurrectionary Com- mittee.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Insurrectionary Committee of Public Safety will remain in
permanence until the total accomplishment of the Insurrection. 4</p>
<p>This sounds ominously like a call for another dictatorship, a change
of mas- ters from one Robespierre to another. In his journal Tribune du
Peuple, Babeuf amplified his dream:</p>
<p>All that is possessed by those who have more than their proportional
part in the goods of society is held by theft and usurpation; it is
therefore just to take it from them. The man who proves that by his own
strength he can earn or do as much as four others is none the less in
conspiracy against society, because he destroys the equilibrium and…
precious equality. Social instruction must progress to the point where
they deprive everyone of the hope of ever becom- ing richer, or more
powerful, or more distinguished by his enlightenment and his talents.
Discord is better than a horrid concord in which hunger strangles one.
Let us go back to chaos, and from chaos let a new regenerated earth
emerge. 5</p>
<p>An agent provocateur informed the Directory that an increasing number
of Parisian proletaires were reading the placards and journals of
Babeuf, and that an armed uprising had been planned for May 1 1, 1796.
On May 10 an order was issued for his arrest and that of his leading
associates: Filippo Buonarrotti, A. Darthe, M.-G. Vadier, and J.- B.
Drouet. After a year’s im - prisonment, during which several attempts to
free them failed, they were tried at Vendome on May 27, 1797.
Buonarrotti served a prison sentence, Drouet escaped. Babeuf and Darthe,
condemned to death, tried suicide, but were hurried to the guillotine
before they could die. Their plan, of course, was so impracticable, so
innocent of the nature of man, that even the prole- tariat of Paris had
not taken it seriously. Besides, by 1797, poor and rich alike, in
France, had found a new hero, the most fascinating dreamer and doer in
the political history of mankind.</p>

<p>“No intellectual exercise,” said Lord Acton, “can be more
invigorating than to watch the working of the mind of Napoleon, the most
entirely known as well as the ablest of historic men.” 6 But who today

<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>learned historians as the hero who struggled to give unity and law to
Eu- rope, and by a hundred learned historians as the ogre who drained
the blood of France, and ravaged Europe, to feed an insatiable will to
power and war? “The French Revolution,” said Nietzsche, “made Napoleon
possible; that is its justification.” 7 Napoleon, musing before the tomb
of Rousseau, mur - mured, “Perhaps it would have been better if neither
of us had ever been born.” 8</p>
<p>He was born at Ajaccio August 15, 1769. Fifteen months earlier Genoa
had sold Corsica to France; only two months earlier a French army had
vali- dated the sale by suppressing Paoli’s revolt; on such trivia
history has turned. Twenty years later Napoleon wrote to Paoli: “I was
born when my country was dying. Thirty thousand Frenchmen disgorged upon
our shores, drown- ing the throne of liberty in a sea of blood; such was
the hateful spectacle that offended my infant eyes.” 9</p>
<p>Corsica, said Livy, “is a rugged, mountainous, almost uninhabitable
island. The people resemble their country, being as ungovernable as wild
beasts.” 10 Contact with Italy had softened some part of this wildness,
but the rough terrain, the hard and almost primitive life, the mortal
family feuds, the fierce defense against invaders, had left the
Corsicans of Paoli’s time fit for guer - rilla warfare or a condottiere
’ s enterprise rather than for the concessions that violent instincts
must make to prosaic order if civilization is to form. Civility was
growing in the capital, but during most of the time that Letizia Ramo-
lino Buonaparte was carrying Napoleon she followed her husband from camp
to camp with Paoli, lived in tents or mountain shacks, and breathed the
air of battle. Her child seemed to remember all this with his blood, for
he was never so happy as in war. He remained to the end a Corsican, and,
in everything but date and education, an Italian, bequeathed to Corsica
by the Renaissance. When he conquered Italy for France the Italians
received him readily; he was the Italian who was conquering France.</p>
<p>His father, Carlo Buonaparte, could trace his lineage far back in the
his- tory of Italy, through a lusty breed living mostly in Tuscany, then
in Genoa, then, in the sixteenth century, migrating to Corsica. The
family treasured a noble pedigree, which was recognized by the French
government; the de, however, was shed when, in the Revolution, a title
to nobility was a step toward the guillotine. Carlo was a man of
adaptable talent; he fought under Paoli for Corsican freedom; when that
movement failed he made his peace with the French, served in the
Franco-Corsican administration, secured the admission of two of his sons
to academies in France, and was among the deputies sent to the
States-General by the Corsican nobility. Napoleon took from his father
his gray eyes, and perhaps his fatal gastric cancer. 11</p>
<p>He took more from his mother. “It is to my mother and her excel lent
principles that I owe all my success, and any good that I have done. I
do not hesitate to affirm that the future of the child depends upon its
mother.” 12 He resembled her in energy, courage, and mad resolution,
even in fidelity to the proliferating Bonapartes. Born in 1750, Letizia
Ramolino was fourteen when she married, thirty-five when widowed; she
bore thirteen children between</p>
<p>92 THEAGEOFNAPOLEON (CHAP. V</p>
<p>1764 and 1784, saw five of them die in childhood, raised the rest
with stern authority, glowed with their pride, and suffered with their
fall.</p>
<p>Napoleon was her fourth, the second to survive infancy. Oldest was
Jo- seph Bonaparte (1768-1844), amiable and cultured epicurean; made
king of Naples and then of Spain, he hoped to be the second emperor of
France. After Napoleon came Lucien (1775-1840), who helped him seize the
French government in 1799, became his passionate enemy, and stood by his
side in the heroic futility of the “Hundred Days.” Then Maria Anna Elisa
(1777-1820), proud and able grand duchess of Tuscany, who opposed her
brother in 1813, and preceded him to death. Then Louis (1778-1846), who
married the kindly Hortense de Beauhamais, became king of Holland, and
begat Napoleon III. Then Pauline (1780-1825), beautiful and scandalously
gay, who married Prince Camillo Borghese, and still holds court, in
Canova’s softly contoured marble in the Galleria Borghese, as one of the
lasting de- lights of Rome. “Pauline and I,” Napoleon recalled, “were
Mother’s favor- ites: Pauline because she was the prettiest and
daintiest of my sisters, and I because a natural instinct told her that
I would be the founder of the fam- ily’s greatness.” 13 Then Maria
Carolina (1782 -1839), who married Joachim Murat and became queen of
Naples. Lastly, Jerome (1784-1860), who founded the Bonapartes of
Baltimore, and rose to be king of Westphalia.</p>
<p>In 1779 Carlo Buonaparte secured from the French government the
privi- lege of sending Napoleon to a military academy at Brienne, some
ninety miles southeast of Paris. It was a cardinal event in the boy’s
life, for it des - tined him to a martial career, and — almost to the
end — to think of life and destiny in terms of war. Brienne became a
formative ordeal for a lad of ten, so far from home in a strange and
strict environment. The other students could not forgive his pride and
temper, which seemed so disproportionate to his obscure nobility. “I
suffered infinitely from the ridicule of my school - mates, who jeered
at me as a fore igner.” The young maverick withdrew into himself, into
studies, books, and dreams. His inclination to taciturnity was deepened;
he spoke little, trusted no one, and kept himself from a world that
seemed organized to torment him. There was one exception: he made
friends with Louis-Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, also a product of
1769; they defended each other, fought each other; after long
separations Bour- rienne became his secretary (1797), and remained close
to him until 1805.</p>
<p>Isolation enabled the young Corsican to excel in studies that fed his
hun- ger for eminence. He fled from Latin as from something dead; he had
no uses for its Virgilian graces or its Taciturnian terseness. He
received little instruction in literature or art, for the teachers were
mostly innocent of these lures. But. he took eagerly to mathematics;
here was a discipline congenial to his demand for exactitude and
clarity, something beyond prejudice and argument, and of constant use to
a military engineer; in this field he led his class. Also he relished
geography; those varied lands were terrain to be studied, people to be
ruled; and they were food for dreams. History was for him, as for
Carlyle, a worship and rosary of heroes, especially those who guided
nations or molded empires. He loved Plutarch even more than</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>Euclid; he breathed the passion of those ancient patriots, he drank
the blood of those historic battles; “There is nothing modem in you,”
Paoli told h im; “you belong wholly to Plutarch.” 14 He would have
understood Heine, who said that when he read Plutarch he longed to mount
a horse and ride forth to conquer Paris. Napoleon reached that goal
through Italy and Egypt, but flank attacks were his forte.</p>
<p>After five years at Brienne, Bonaparte, now fifteen, was among the
stu- dents selected from the twelve military schools of France to
receive ad- vanced instruction at the £cole Militaire in Paris. In
October, 1785, he was assigned as second lieutenant of artillery to the
La Fere Regiment stationed at Valence on the Rhone. His total pay there
was 1,120 livres per year; 15 out of this, apparently, he sent something
to help his mother care for her grow- ing brood. As his father had died
in February, and Joseph was as yet with- out means, Napoleon had become
acting head of the clan. On his furloughs he made several visits to
Corsica, lonesome, he said, for “the smell of its earth,” for its
“precipices, high mountains, and deep ravines.” 16</p>
<p>At Valence, and in 1788 at Auxonne, he earned the respect of his
fellow officers by his rapid progress in military sciences and arts, his
quickness to learn, his fertility in practical suggestions, and his
readiness to share in the hard physical work of managing artillery. He
carefully studied the Essai de tactique generate (1772) and other
martial texts by Julie de Lespinasse’s negligent lover, Jacques-
Antoine-Hippolyte de Guibert. Napoleon was no longer an outcast; he made
friends, attended theaters, heard concerts, took lessons in dancing, and
discovered the charms of women. On a furlough in Paris (January 22,
1787) he laboriously talked himself into an unpremedi- tated adventure
with a streetwalker; “that night,” he assures us, “I knew a woman for
the first time.” 17 Nevertheless some somber moods remained. At times,
alone in his simple room, he asked himself why, in pure logic, he should
continue to live. “As I must die sometime, it would perhaps be
better</p>
<p>He found time, in his free hours, to extend his self-education in
literature and history. Mme. de Remusat, later lady-in-waiting to
Josephine, thought that he was “ignorant, reading but little, and that
hurriedly”; 19 and yet we find that at Valence and Auxonne he read
dramas by Corneille, Moliere, Racine, and Voltaire, 20 memorized some
passages, reread Amyot’s translation of Plutarch, and studied
Machiavelli’s Prince, Montesquieu’s Esprit des lois, Raynal’s Histoire
philosophique des deux Indes, Marigny’s Histoire des arabes, Houssaye’s
Histoire du gouvernement de Venise, Barrow’s Histoire d’Angleterre, and
many more. He took notes as he read, and made sum - maries of the major
works; 368 pages of these notes survive from his youth. 21 He was of the
Italian Renaissance in character, and of the French Enlighten- ment in
mind. But also the romantic streak in him responded to the passion- ate
prose of Rousseau and the poems ascrib ed to “Ossian,” which he relished
“for the same reason that made me delight in the murmur of the winds and
waves.” 22</p>
<p>When the Revolution came he welcomed it, and spent another
furlough,</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>in 1790, working for full acceptance of the new regime. In 1791 he
sub- mitted to the Academy of Lyons — in competition for a prize offered
by Raynal — an essay on “What truths or sentiments should be imputed to
men to further their happiness?” Perhaps under the spell of Rousseau’s
Julie, ou La Nouvelle Helo’ise, which had “turned his head,” 23 the
young army officer replied: Teach them that the best life is a simple
one, parents and children tilling the soil, enjoying its fruits, far
from the exciting and corrupting influ- ence of the city. All a man
needs for happiness is food and clothing, a hut and a wife; let him
work, eat, beget, and sleep, and he will be happier than a prince. The
life and philosophy of the Spartans was the best. “Virtue con - sists in
courage and strength;… energy is the life of the soul…. The strong man
is good; only the weak man is bad.” 24 Here the young Napoleon echoed
Thrasymachus 26 and foreshadowed Nietzsche, who returned the compliment
by making Napoleon a hero of the will to power. 28 Amid the argument he
went out of his way to condemn absolute monarchy, class privileges, and
ecclesiastical trumpery. The Lyons Academy rejected the essay as
immature.</p>
<p>In September, 1791, Napoleon again visited his native land. He
rejoiced in the decree by which the Constituent Assembly had made
Corsica a departe- ment of France, and had dowered its people with all
the privileges of French citizens. Withdrawing his vows of vengeance
upon the nation that had so violently made him a Frenchman, he felt that
the Revolution was creating a brilliant new France. In an imaginary
conversation — Le Souper de Beau- caire — published at his own expense
in the fall of 1793, he defended the Revolution as “a combat to the
death between the patriots and the despots of Europe,” 27 and urged all
the oppressed to join in the struggle for the rights of man. His old
hero Paoli, however, felt that membership of Corsica in the French
nation would be acceptable to him only if he were given full authority
in the island, with finances to be supplied by France, but with the
rigorous exclusion of French soldiers from Corsican soil. Napoleon
thought this proposal extreme; he broke with his idol, and opposed
Paoli’s candidates in the Ajaccio municipal election of April 1, 1792.
Paoli won, and Napoleon returned to France.</p>
<p>In Paris, on June 20, he saw the populace invade the Tuileries; he
mar- veled that the King did not di sperse the “cannibals” with a
fusillade from his Swiss Guards. On August 10 he saw the sansculottes
and the Federes drive the royal family from the palace; he described the
crowd as “the lowest scum;… they do not belong to the working classes at
al l.” 28 With rising reservations he continued to support the
Revolution, being now an officer in its Army. In December, 1793, as
already related, he distinguished himself in the capture of Toulon. The
commendation sent to Robespierre resulted in the appointment of Napoleon
as brigadier general at the age of twenty-four; but it shared in his
being arrested as a Robes pierriste (August 6, 1794) after Robespierre’s
fall. He was imprisoned at Antibes, and was scheduled for trial</p>

<p>wandering along the Seine, meditating suicide, when a friend,
encountering him, revived him with a gift of thirty thousand francs; 29
Napoleon later re- turned the sum manifold. In June Boissy d’Anglas
described him as “a little Italian, pale, slender, and puny, but
singularly audacious in his views.” 30 He thought for a time of going to
Turkey, reorganizing the Sultan’s army, and carving out for himself some
Oriental realm. In a more practical mood he drew up for the War Ministry
a plan of campaign for driving the Austrians out of Italy.</p>
<p>Then, in one of those whims of history that open a door to the
inevitable, the Convention, besieged (October 5, 1795) by royalists and
others, as- signed Barras to organize its defense. He decided that a
blast of artillery would do it, but no artillery was at hand. He had
noted Napoleon ’s enter - prise at Toulon; he sent for him, commissioned
him to secure and use artil- lery; it was done, and Napoleon became at
once famous and infamous. When the War Ministry needed a bold and
enterprising commander to lead the Army of Italy, Carnot (or Barras 31 )
secured the appointment for Bona- parte (March 2, 1796). Seven days
later the happy general married the still beautiful Josephine.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>JOSEPHINE DE BEAUHARNAIS</li>
</ol>
<p>She was a Creole — i.e., a person of French or Spanish descent born
and raised in tropical colonies. The island of Martinique, in the
Caribbean, had been French for 128 years when Marie- Josephe-Rose
Tascher de la Pagerie was born there in 1763 of an old Orleans family.
Her uncle, Baron de Tascher, was then governor of the port; her father
had been a page in the household of the Dauphine Marie-Josephe, mother
of Louis XVI. She was educated at the Convent of the Ladies of
Providence in Fort-Royal (now Fort-de-France), seat of the colonial
government. The curriculum then consisted of catechism, deportment,
penmanship, drawing, embroidery, dancing, and music; the nuns believed
that these would get a woman much further than Latin, Greek, history,
and philosophy; and Josephine proved them right. She became, as had been
said of Mme. de Pompadour, “a morsel for a king.”</p>
<p>At sixteen she was taken to France and was married to Vicomte Alex-
andre de Beauharnais, then only nineteen, but already experienced in the
philandering ways of the French aristocracy. Soon lus long and frequent
absences betrayed his adulteries, and left in the impressionable
Josephine the conviction that the Sixth Commandment was not intended for
the upper classes. She gave herself devotedly to her two children —
Eugene (178 1 —</p>

<li>and Hortense (1783-1837), who rewarded her with their lifelong
loyalty.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Revolution came, the Vicomte adjusted his politics to the
new regime, and for five years he kept his head. But as the Terror
proceeded, any title to nobility could be a warrant for arrest. In 1794
both Alexandre and</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Josephine were apprehended, and separately imprisoned; and on July 24
he was guillotined. While awaiting a similar fate Josephine accepted the
amor- ous advances of General Lazare Hoche. 32 She was among the many
nobles released after the fall of Robespierre.</p>
<p>Made almost destitute by the confiscation of her husband’s wealth,
and anxious to provide care and education for her children, Josephine
used the lure of her dark-blue eyes and languorous beauty to make a
friend of Tallien and a lover of the rising Barras. 33 Much of
Beauhamais’ confiscated wealth</p>
<p>He attended some of her soirees, and was fascinated by her mature
charms, her easy grace, and what her indulgent father called her “exceed
- ingly sweet disposition.” 36 She was not impressed by Bonaparte, who
appeared to her as a sallow youth with a “lean and hungry look,” and a
cor - responding income. She sent her son, now fourteen, to solicit his
aid in recov- ering the confiscated sword of her husband. Eugene was so
comely and modest that Napoleon at once agreed to attend to the matter.
It was done; Josephine called on him to thank him; and invited him to
lunch for October</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>He came, and was conquered. As early as December, 1795, she admitted
him to her bed, 37 but they were reluctant to marry. He reminisced at
St. Helena: “Barras did me a service by advising me to marry Josephine.
He assured me that she belonged to both the old and the new society, and
that this fact would bring me more support; that her house was the best
in Paris, and would rid me of my Corsican name; finally that through
this marriage I should become quite French.” 38 Barras gave her similar
advice, for reasons still debated; 39 here, he told her, is a man who
gives every sign of forging a high place for himself in the world.
Napoleon was not deterred by her former amours; “Everything about you
pleased me,” he would soon write to her, “even to the memory of the
error of your way s… Virtue, for me, consisted of what you made it.”
40</li>
</ol>
<p>They were married on March 9, 1796, by a purely civil ceremony;
Tallien and Barras served as witnesses; no relatives were invited. To
mitigate the disparity of their ages — he twenty-seven, she thirty-three
— Napoleon regis- tered himself as twenty-eight, Josephine wrote her age
as twenty-nine. 41 They spent their wedding night at her home. He
encountered virile oppo- sition from her pet dog, Fortune. “That
gentleman,” he tells us, “was in po ssession of Madame’s bed…. I wanted
to have him leave, but to no avail; I was told to share the bed with him
or sleep elsewhere; I had to take it or leave it. The favorite was less
accommodating than I was”; at the worst pos - sible moment the dog bit
his leg, so severely that he long kept the scar. 42</p>
<p>On March 11, torn between his new delight and his ruling passion for
power and glory, Napoleon left to lead the Army of Italy, in one of the
most brilliant campaigns in history.</p>

<li>ITALIAN WHIRLWIND: MARCH 27, 1 796 - DECEMBER 5, 1 797</li>
</ol>
<p>The military situation had been simplified by treaties with Prussia
and Spain, but Austria refused peace so long as France clung to her
conquests in the Netherlands and along the Rhine. England continued the
war at sea, and granted a subsidy of £600,000 to Austria to finance the
war on land. Austria had ruled Lombardy since 1713. She was now allied
with Charles Emmanuel IV, king of Sardinia and Piedmont, who hoped to
regain Savoy and Nice, taken by the French in 1792.</p>
<p>The Directory, led in this matter by Carnot, planned its military
opera- tions for 1796 as a three-pronged assault upon Austria. One
French army, under Jourdan, was to attack the Austrians on the northeast
front along tne Sambre and the Meuse; another, under Moreau, was to
proceed against the Austrians along the Moselle and the Rhine; a third,
under Bonaparte, was to attempt the expulsion of the Austrians and the
Sardinians from Italy. Jour- dan, after some victories, encountered the
superior forces of the Archduke Karl Ludwig, suffered defeats at Amberg
and Wurzburg, and retreated to the west bank of the Rhine. Moreau
advanced into Bavaria almost to Munich, then, learning that the
victorious Archduke could cut his line of communi- cations or attack him
in the rear, he withdrew into Alsace. The Directory, as a final hope,
turned to Napoleon.</p>
<p>Reaching Nice on March 27, he found the “Army of Italy” in no condi -
tion to face the Austrian and Sardinian forces that blocked the narrow
entrance into Italy between the Mediterranean and the towering Alps. His
troops numbered some 43,000, brave men accustomed to mountain war, but
ill-clothed, ill-shod, and so poorly fed that they had to steal in order
to live; 43 hardly thirty thousand of them could be called upon for
arduous campaigns. They had scant cavalry and almost no artillery. The
generals over whom the twenty-seven-year-old commander had been placed —
Auge- reau, Massena, Laharpe, and Sesurier — were all older than
Napoleon in ser- vice; they resented his appointment, and were resolved
to make him feel their superior experience; but at their first meeting
with him they were awed into quick obedience by the confident clarity
with which he explained his plans and gave his orders.</p>
<p>He could overawe his generals, but he could not free himself from the
spell that Josephine laid upon him. Four days after reaching Nice he put
his maps and orderlies aside and wrote to her a letter hot with the
ardor of a youth who had just discovered depths of passion under his
dreams of power:</p>
<p>Nice, j 1 March, 1796</p>

my arms. I cannot drink a cup of tea without cursing the martial

<p>Goodbye! Ah, if you love me less it must be that you never loved me
at all. Then were I indeed to be pitied.</p>
<p>Bonaparte 44</p>
<p>He wrote to her again on April 3 and 7, amid the rising tempo of the
war. He studied all the information he could get about the enemy forces
that he must defeat; an Austrian army under Beaulieu at Voltri near
Genoa; another under Argentau at Montenotte, farther west; and a
Sardinian army under Colli at Ceva, farther north. Beaulieu assumed that
his lines of communications would serve to inform him should any of his
armies need urgent help. On that basis he could reasonably expect to
repel the French attack, for his combined forces outnumbered the French
about two to one. Napoleon’s strategy was to move as many of his troops,
as secretly and rapidly as possible, to confront one of the defending
armies, and overwhelm it before either of the other two could come to
its aid. The plan involved rapid marches by the French over rough and
mountainous routes; it required hardy and resolute warriors. Napoleon
sought to arouse them with the first of those famous proclamations that
were no small part of his armament:</p>
<p>Soldiers, you are hungry and naked. The Republic owes you much, but
she has not the means to pay her debts. I am come to lead you into the
most fertile plains that the sun beholds. Rich provinces, opulent towns;
all shall be at your disposal. Soldiers! with such a prospect before
you, can you fail in courage and constancy ? 45</p>
<p>It was an open invitation to plunder, but how else could he get these
un- paid men to bear long marches and then face death? Napoleon, like
most rulers and revolutionists, never allowed morality to hinder
victory, and he trusted to success to whitewash his sins. Should not
Italy contribute to the cost of her liberation?</p>
<p>The first goal of his strategy was to smash the Sardinian army and
induce the King of Sardinia to retire to Turin, his Piedmont capital. A
series of crucial and successful engagements — Montenotte (April 11),
Millesimo (April 13), Dego (April 15), and Mondovi (April 2 2 ) —
shattered the Sar- dinian forces and compelled Charles Emmanuel to sign
at Cherasco (April</p>

<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>completing the foresight of strategy that often caught the enemy on
flank or rear. The older generals learned to obey him with confidence in
his vision and judgment; the younger officers — Junot, Lannes, Murat,
Marmont, Berthier — developed for him a devotion that repeatedly faced
death in his cause. When, after these victories, the exhausted survivors
reached the heights of Monte Zemoto — from which they could view the
sunlit plains of Lombardy — many of them broke out in a spontaneous
salute to the youth who had led them so brilliantly.</p>
<p>Now they did not have to plunder in order to live; wherever he estab-
lished French rule Napoleon taxed the rich and the ecclesiastical
hierarchy, and persuaded or ordered the towns to contribute to the
upkeep and orderly behavior of his troops. On April 26, at Cherasco, he
addressed his army in a clever eulogy that cautioned them against
pillage:</p>
<p>Soldiers:</p>
<p>You have in a fortnight won six victories, taken twenty-one
standards, fifty- five pieces of artillery, and conquered the richest
part of Piedmont…. With- out any resources you have supplied all that
was necessary. You have won battles without cannon, passed rivers
without bridges, made forced marches without shoes, camped without
brandy and often without bread…. Your grateful country will owe its
prosperity to you….</p>
<p>But, soldiers, you have done nothing as yet compared with what there
still remains to do. Neither Turin nor Milan remains to you…. Is there
anyone among you whose courage is lacking? Is there anyone who would
prefer to return across the summits of the Apennines and the Alps and
bear patiently the disgrace of a slavish soldier? No, there is none such
among the conquerors of Montenotte, of Dego, of Mondovi. All of you are
burning to extend the glory of the French people….</p>
<p>Friends, I am promising you this conquest, but there is one condition
which you must swear to fulfill. That is to respect the peoples whom you
deliver, and repress the horrible pillage which certain scoundrels,
incited by our ene- mies, commit. Otherwise you will not be the
deliverers of the people but their scourges…. Your victories, your
bravery, your success, the blood of your brothers who have died in
battle — all will be lost, even honor and glory. As for me and the
generals who have your confidence, we should blush to command an army
without discipline and restraint…. Anyone who engages in pillage will be
shot without mercy.</p>
<p>Peoples of Italy, the French army comes to break your chains; the
French people is the friend of all peoples. You may receive them with
confidence. Your property, your religion, and your customs will be
respected…. We have no grudge except against the tyrants who oppress
you.</p>
<p>Bonaparte</p>
<p>There had been much pillage in that first campaign; there would still
be some despite this plea and threat. Napoleon had some looters shot,
and par- doned others. “These wretches,” he said, “are excusable; they
have sighed for three years after the promised land,… and now that they
have entered it they wish to enjoy it.” 46 He appeased them by letting
them share in the contributions and provisions that he exacted from the
“liberated” towns.</p>
<p>Amid all this turmoil of marches, battles, and diplomacy he thought
al- most hourly of the wife he had left so soon after their wedding
night. Now</p>

<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>hat she might safely pass over the Cevennes he begged her, in a
letter of April 17, to come to him. “Come quickly,” he wrote on April
24, 1796; “I warn you, if you delay longer, you will find me ill. These
fatigues and your absence — the two together are more than I can bear….
Take wings, and fly…. A kiss upon your heart, another a little lower,
another lower still, far lower !” 47</p>
<p>Was she faithful? Could she, so accustomed to her pleasures, content
her- self for months with epistolary adulation? That same April a
handsome offi- cer, Hippolyte Charles, aged twenty-four, found his way
to her. In May she invited Talleyrand to meet him. “You will be wild
about him. Mesdames Recamier, Tallien, and Hamelin have all lost their
heads over him.” 48 She became so enamored of him that when Murat came
to her from Bonaparte with money and instructions for joining him in
Italy, she delayed on the ground of illness, and allowed Murat to send
word to his chief that she gave signs of pregnancy. Napoleon wrote to
her on May 1 3 : “It is true, then, that</p>
<p>Meanwhile he led his men through a dozen battles to the prize of Lom-
bardy — the rich and cultured city of Milan. At Lodi, on the west bank
of the Adda, his main force caught up with the main Austrian army under
Beau- lieu. Beaulieu retreated, crossed the river on a 200-meter-long
wooden bridge, and then placed his artillery in a position to prevent a
similar cross- ing by the French. Napoleon bade his cavalry to ride
north till they could find a place to ford the stream, and then to pass
south and attack the Aus- trian rear. Keeping his infantry sheltered
behind the walls and houses of the town, he shared actively in directing
the fire of his artillery against the Aus - trian guns that covered the
bridge. When his cavalry suddenly appeared on the east bank and charged
into the Austrians, he ordered his grenadiers to lead the way across the
bridge. They tried, but the Austrian artillery halted them. Napoleon
rushed forward and joined Lannes and Berthier in leading them. The
Austrians were routed (May 10, 1796), losing two thousand prisoners.
Beaulieu withdrew to Mantua, and the French army, after a day’s rest,
marched on to Milan. It was from this action that the French troops,
moved by Bona parte’s reckless but inspiring exposure of himself to
enemy fire, conferred upon him the affectionate title “Le Petit
Caporal”— the Little Corporal.</p>
<p>Shortly after this victory he received from the Directory a proposal
so insulting that he risked his career on his reply. Those five men, who
had been enjoying the celebrations with which Paris received the news of
Na- poleon’s achievements, informed him (May 7) that his army was now to
be divided into two parts; one was to be put under the command of
General Frangois-Ltienne Kellermann (son of the victor of Valmy), and
charged with protecting the French in north Italy from Austrian attacks;
the other,</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>under Bonaparte, was to march south and bring the Papal States and
the kingdom of Naples under French control. Napoleon saw in this not
only a personal injury but, even more, a cardinal error in strategy: not
only would an attack upon the Papacy enflame all the Catholics of
Europe, including France, against the Revolution, but Catholic Austria
was already preparing to send a powerful force, under the experienced
Field Marshal Count Dago- bert von Wurmser, to drive him back into
France. He answered that the Army of Italy would need its united and
replenished strength to preserve its gains; that it could be
successfully led only by an undivided command; that he would therefore
yield his place to General Kellermann, and would offer his
resignation.</p>
<p>The Directory received this message along with reports of Napoleon’s
latest military and diplomatic successes. For the young general — proud
with victory, and feeling that those distant politicians were not as
well placed as he to negotiate treaties according with the resources of
the enemy and the condition of the French army — had assumed the right
to make peace as well as war, and to determine the price that each
Italian city or state should pay to enjoy the protection, rather than
suffer the avidity, of his troops. So, after entering Milan in triumph
(May 15, 1796), he arranged truces with the Duke of Parma, the Duke of
Modena, and the King of Naples, by which he guaranteed them peace with
France and protection from Austria, and speci- fied what donations each
of these principalities was to pay for this benevo- lent amity. They
paid painful sums, and bore in grim impotence the theft of art
masterpieces from their galleries, palaces, and public squares.</p>
<p>Milan made him welcome. For nearly a century it had longed for
freedom from Austrian rule, and this young warlord was unusually
gracious for a conqueror. He was congenial to Italian speech and ways,
appreciative of Italian women, music, and art; they did not realize at
once how fondly he appreciated Italian art. In any case, was he not,
except for a month or so, an Italian? Visibly he gathered about him
Italian artists, poets, historians, phi- losophers, scientists, and
talked familiarly with them; for a time he seemed to be Lodovico Sforza
and Leonardo da Vinci reborn and merged. What could be more charming
than his letter to the astronomer Barnaba Oriani? —</p>
<p>Learned men in Milan used not to enjoy the consideration they
deserved. Hidden in their laboratories, they thought themselves happy if
kings and priests did them no harm. It is not so now. In Italy thought
has become free. There is no more Inquisition, no more intolerance, no
more tyranny. I invite all learned men to meet together, and to tell me
what methods should be adopted, or what needs supplied, in order to give
the sciences and the fine arts a new life…. Pray express these
sentiments for me to the distinguished men of learning dwelling in
Milan. 50</p>
<p>Napoleon incorporated Milan and other cities in a Republic of
Lombardy, whose citizens were to share with the French in liberty,
equality, fraternity, and taxes. In a proclamation to the new citizens
(May 19, 1796) he ex- plained that since the liberating army had paid a
high price for freeing Lom- bardy, the liberated should contribute some
twenty million francs to the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>upkeep of his troops; this, surely, was a small contribution for so
fertile a country; moreover, the tax should “be levied on the rich… and
on church corporations,” so as to spare the poor. 51 Not so much
publicity had accom - panied the previous day’s order that “an agent
should follow the French army in Italy, to seek out and transfer to the
Republic all the objects of art, science, and so forth, that are in the
conquered towns.” 52 The Italians could only revenge themselves with a
pun: “Non tutti Francesi sono ladroni, ma buona parte” (Not all
Frenchmen are robbers, but a good part are). Napo - leon, however, was
following the example set by the Convention and the Directory.</p>
<p>This artistic spoliation of conquered or liberated lands had scant
prece- dent; it aroused indignation everywhere except in France, and set
a model for later warriors. Most of the spoils were sent to the
Directory, were re- ceived there with pleasure, and found their way into
the Louvre, where the Mona Lisa, though raped, never lost her smile.
Napoleon kept little of the Italian revenues for himself; 53 some of
them were invested in judicious bribes; much went to pay the troops and
so moderate their zeal to steal.</p>
<p>Having feathered a nest for his bride, he importuned her (May 18) to
come and join him. “Milan… cannot but please you, for this is a very
beau - tiful land. As for me, I shall be wild with joy…. I am dying of
curiosity to see how you carry your child…. Addio, mio dolce amor…. Come
quickly to hear the fine music and to see beautiful Italy.” 54 While his
letter traveled he returned to the business of driving the Austrians
from Italy. On May 20 he was again with his troops; and knowing that
they would soon have to face many obstacles and armies, he addressed
them in another elo- quent proclamation:</p>
<p>Soldiers!</p>
<p>You have rushed like a torrent from the heights of the Apennines; you
have overthrown and scattered every force that opposed your march…. The
Po, the Ticino, the Adda could not stop your progress by a day…. Yes,
soldiers, you have done much, but is there nothing left for you to do?…
No! I see you already flying to arms; a slothful repose wearies you;
every day lost for your glory is lost, too, for your happiness. Let us
move on! We still have forced marches to make, enemies to overcome,
laurels to win, wrongs to avenge….</p>
<p>Let not the people be disturbed by our advance; we are the friends of
all peoples!… You will have the immortal glory of changing the face of
the most beautiful part of Europe. The free French nation… will give to
Europe a glorious peace…. Then you will return to your homes, and your
fellow citizens, singling you out, will say, “He was with the Army of
Italy.” 55</p>
<p>On May 27 they resumed their advance through Lombardy. Ignoring the
fact that Brescia was Venetian territory, Napoleon occupied it, and made
it the first center of the new campaign. When Venice sent envoys to
protest, Bonaparte, in one of his feigned rages, frightened them by
demanding why Venice had already allowed the Austrians to use Venetian
towns and roads; the envoys offered an apology, and agreed to his
similar use of Venetian terrain. 56 A swift march brought the French
army to Peschiera; the Austrian</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>I0 3</p>
<p>detachment that had been left there fled; Napoleon had the strategic
fortress strengthened to protect his communications, and pushed on to
Mantua, where the remnants of Beaulieu’s three armies had taken refuge
behind ap - parently inexpugnable defenses. Napoleon left part of his
forces to besiege the citadel. Another part he sent south to drive the
British from Leghorn; it was done, and a popular revolt soon forced them
to leave Corsica. Murat found it simple to evict the Austrian envoy from
Genoa, and to incorporate that Mediterranean bastion in a Republic of
Liguria under French control. Seldom had Italy seen so many changes of
power in so short a time.</p>
<p>Napoleon returned to Milan and awaited Josephine. She came, on July 1
3, and the victor embraced his conqueror. The next day the city honored
her with a special performance at La Scala, followed by a ball at which
all the local notables were presented to her. After three days of
ecstasy the general had to return to his troops at Marmirolo, from which
he sent her a paean of youthful adoration:</p>
<p>I have been sad every moment since our parting. I know no happiness
save when I am with you…. The charms of my incomparable Josephine kindle
a flame that burns incessantly in my heart, through my senses. When
shall I ever be free of anxiety and responsibility, free to spend all my
time with you, with nothing to do but love you… ?</p>
<p>A few days ago I thought 1 loved you, but now that I have seen you
again I love you a thousand times more….</p>
<p>Ah, I implore you, let me see that you have faults. Be less
beautiful, less gracious, less kind, less tender. Above all, never be
jealous, never weep. Your tears rob me of my reason, set my blood
aflame….</p>
<p>… Come quickly to join me, so that at least before we die we can say:
“We have had many joyous hours together.”… 57</p>
<p>She obeyed despite the danger of enemy snipers en route, caught up to
him at Brescia, and accompanied him to Verona. There a courier brought
him word that a fresh Austrian army was entering Italy under the command
of Count von Wurmser, who had recently driven the French from Mann-
heim. It was calculated that this host would outnumber three to one the
forces under Napoleon. Anticipating possible disaster, he sent Josephine
back to Peschiera, and arranged to have her taken thence to Florence.
Mean- while he ordered the French detachments that he had left before
Mantua to abandon the siege and to come by a safe roundabout route to
join his main army. They arrived in time to take part in the battle of
Castiglione (August 5, 1796). Wurmser, not expecting so early an attack,
was leading his divisions southward in too thin a line. Napoleon pounced
upon the un- prepared Austrians, confused them into flight, and took
fifteen thousand jrisoners. Wurmser retreated to Rovereto; the French
pursued and defeated iim there, and again at Bassano; the disheartened
old general fled with the remnants of his army to seek refuge behind the
battlements of Mantua. Na- poleon left some regiments to hold him
there.</p>
<p>But now 60,000 additional Austrians, under Baron Alvinczy, poured

<p>reached only by crossing a bridge under fire. Again, as at Lodi on
the Adda, Napoleon was among the first to cross.* “When I was in the
raging turmoil of the fight,” he later recalled, “my adjutant, Colonel
Muiron, threw himself toward me, covered me with his body, and received
the bullet which was intended for me. He sank at my feet.” 58 In the
three -day battle that followed (November 15-17, 1796), the Austrians,
after a brave fight, fell back in an orderly retreat. Alvinczy
reorganized them at Rivoli, but there they were defeated again, and
Alvinczy, having lost thirty thousand men, led the sur- vivors back to
Austria. Wurmser, losing hope of rescue, and taking pity on his starving
men, surrendered (February 2, 1797), and the French conquest of Lombardy
was complete.</p>
<p>Insatiate, Napoleon turned his face and forces south toward the Papal
States and politely asked Pius VI to give him Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna,
Ancona, and their subject lands. By the Treaty of Tolentino (February
19,</p>
<ol start="1797" type="1">
<li>the Pope surrendered these city- states, and paid an “indemnity” of
fifteen million francs toward the French army’s expense account. Then,
mas - ter of all north Italy except Piedmont and Venice, Napoleon
reorganized his army, added to them some regiments formed in Italy and a
fresh division from France under General Bernadotte, led 75,000 men
across the Alps through three feet of snow, and proposed to strike at
Vienna itself, the im- perial center of the attack upon the French
Revolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Emperor Francis II sent against him forty thousand men under the
Archduke Karl Ludwig, fresh from victories along the Rhine. Surprised by
the reported number of the advancing French, and respectful of
Napoleon’s reputation, Karl adopted a strategy of retreat. Bonaparte
followed until he was within sixty miles of the Austrian capital. With
or without a battle he might have taken the city, then humming with old
Haydn and young Bee- thoven. But in that case the government would fall
back toward Hungary, the war could lengthen in time and space, and, with
winter setting in, the French army would find itself in hostile and
unfamiliar territory, subject at any moment to a flank attack. In a rare
moment of modesty, and with a caution that might have served him well in
his later years, Napoleon sent the Archduke an invitation to negotiate a
truce. The Archduke refused; Napo- leon inflicted severe defeats upon
his forces at Neumarkt and Umzmarkt; Karl agreed to talk. At Leoben,
April 18, 1797, the young commanders signed a preliminary peace, subject
to ratification by their governments.</p>
<p>The road to ratification was blocked by Austria’s ref usal to
surrender — and Napoleon’s resolve to keep— his conquests in Lombardy.
An apparently minor event gave him a gambler’s chance to escape this
impasse. He had occupied several cities belonging to Venice; in some of
these towns insur- rections had broken out against the French garrisons.
Charging the Venetian Senate with having instigated these uprisings,
Napoleon deposed it and set up in its place a municipal structure
subject to French control and shorn of</p>

<p>its mainland possessions. When the time came to transform the
preliminaries of Leoben into the Treaty of Campoformio (October 17,
1797), Napoleon offered Austria a free hand in absorbing Venice into her
empire in return for the cession of Lombardy and Belgium, and
recognition of French rights to the left bank of the Rhine. Nearly all
Europe, forgetting a thousand trea- ties, reacted with horror to this
diplomatic philanthropy with other people’s property.</p>
<p>The new Machiavelli insisted, however, on keeping for France the
Vene- tian islands in the Adriatic — Corfu, Zante, Cephalonia. “These,”

Republic around Genoa, both governed by native democracies under French

spoils, returned to Paris to have his treaties ratified by the
transformed Directory which he had helped to install.</p>
<p>V. THE COUP D’ETAT OF THE 18TH FRUCTIDOR: SEPTEMBER 4, 1 797</p>
<p>It was not the same Paris that he had known in the crowd-ruled days
of ’92 and ’93. Ever since the fall of Robespierre in ’94 the capital
had fol- lowed the countryside in an intensifying reaction — religious
and political — against the Revolution. Catholicism, led by nonjuring
priests, was regaining its hold upon a people that had lost belief in an
earthly substitute for super- natural hopes and consolations, for
sacraments, ceremonies, and processional holy days. The decadi, or
decimal day of rest, was increasingly ignored; the Christian Sunday was
flagrantly respected and enjoyed. France was voting for God.</p>
<p>And for a king. In homes and salons, in the press and on the streets,
even in section assemblies once ruled by sansculottes, men and women
aired re- grets for bonhomme Louis XVI, found excuses for Bourbon
faults, and asked could any other government than an authoritative
monarchy bring order, safety, prosperity, and peace out of the chaos,
crime, corruption, and war that were desolating France? Returned emigres
congregated in such number that a wit called their favorite Parisian
purlieu le petit Coblenz (from the haven of titled exiles in Germany) ;
and there one could hear the monarchi- cal philosophies that were being
preached abroad by Bonald and de Maistre. The electoral assemblies,
overwhelmingly bourgeois, were sending to the</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Council of Ancients and the Council of Five Hundred more and more
depu- ties ready to flirt with royalty if it offered a property
guarantee. By 1797 the monarchists in the Councils were strong enough to
elect to the Direc- tory the Marquis de Barthelemy. Lazare Carnot, a
director since 1795, had turned to the right in reaction against the
propaganda of Babeuf, and looked with complacent eye upon religion as a
vaccination against communism. The firmly republican Directors — Barras,
Larevelliere-Lepaux, and Rewbell — felt endangered in their tenure and
their lives by the movement toward monarchism, and decided to risk all
on a coup d’etat that would eliminate its leaders from both the Councils
and the Directory. They sought popular support from the radical
Jacobins, who had been hiding in bitter obscurity during the
conservative revival. They sought military support by appealing to
Napoleon to send them from Italy a general capable of organizing
Parisian soldiery for the defense of the republic. He was willing to
accommodate them; a Bourbon revival would frustrate his plans; the road
must be kept open for his own rise to political power, and the time was
not ripe for that plunge. He sent them tough Pierre Augereau, veteran of
many campaigns. Augereau enlisted a part of Hoche’s troops; with these,
on the 1 8th Fructi - dor, he invaded the legislative chambers, arrested
fifty-three deputies, many royalist agents, and Directors Barthelemy and
Carnot. Carnot escaped to Switzerland; most of the others were deported
to sweat and wither in South American Guiana. In the elections of 1797
the radicals won control of the Councils; they added Merlin of Douai and
Jean-Baptiste Treilhard to the victorious “triumvirs,” and gave this
revis ed Directory almost absolute</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>power,</p>
<p>When Napoleon reached Paris, December 5, 1797, he found a new Terror
operating, aimed at all conservatives, and substituting Guiana for the
guillo- tine. Nevertheless all classes seemed to unite in feting the
invincible young general who had added half of Italy to France. He put
aside for the present his look of stern command. He dressed modestly,
and pleased variously: the conservatives by lauding order; the Jacobins
by appearing to have raised Italy fro m vassalage to liberty; the
intelligentsia by writing that “the true conquests, the only ones that
leave no regrets, are those that are made over ignorance.” 61 On
December 10 the dignitaries of the national government</p>
<p>The Directory gave General Bonaparte a solemn reception which in some
respects marked an epoch in the history of the Revolution. They chose
for this ceremony the court of the Luxembourg Palace; no hall would have
been vast enough to contain the crowd that was attracted; there were
spectators in every window and on the roof. The five Directors, in Roman
costume, were placed on a stage in the court; near them were the
deputies of the Council of the Ancients, the Council of Five Hundred,
and the Institute….</p>
<p>Bonaparte arrived very simply dressed, followed by his aides-de-camp
or assistant officers; all of them taller than he, but bent with the
respect they showed him. The elite of France, gathered there, covered
the victorious gen-</p>

<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>IO7</p>
<p>eral with applause. He was the hope of every man, republican or
royalist; all saw the present and the future as held in his strong
hands. 62</p>
<p>On that occasion he handed the Directors the completed Treaty of
Campo- formio. It was officially ratified, and Napoleon could for a time
rest on his victories in diplomacy as well as war.</p>
<p>After attending a sumptuous party given in his honor by the
indestructible Talleyrand (then minister for foreign affairs), he
retired to his home in the Rue Chantereine. There he relaxed with
Josephine and her children, and for some time kept himself so out of the
public eye that his admirers com- mented on his modesty and his
detractors rejoiced over his decline. How- ever, he made a point of
visiting the Institute; he talked mathematics with Lagrange, astronomy
with Laplace, government with Sieyes, literature with Marie-Joseph de
Chenier, and art with David. Probably he was already meditating a sally
into Egypt, and thought of taking with him a garnish- ment of scholars
and scientists.</p>
<p>The Directory saw something to be suspected in such uncharacteristic
modesty; this youth, who in Italy and Austria had behaved as if he were
the government — might he not decide to behave likewise in Paris? Hoping
to keep him busy at a distance, they offered him command of the fifty
thou- sand soldiers and sailors that were assembling at Brest for an
invasion of England. Napoleon studied the project, rejected it, and
warned the Direc- tory, in a letter of February 23, 1798:</p>
<p>We should give up any real attempt to invade England, and content
our- selves with the appearance of it, while devoting all our attention
and resources to the Rhine…. We must not keep a large army at a distance
from Ger- many…. Or we might make an expedition into the Levant, and
threaten the commerce of [England with] India. 63</p>
<p>There was his dream. Even amid the Italian campaigns, he had pondered
the possibilities of a foray into the Orient: in the soft decay of the
Ottoman realm a bold spirit, with brave and hungry men, might forge a
career, might carve an empire. England ruled the oceans, but her hold on
the Mediter- ranean could be loosed by taking Malta; her hold on India
could be weak- ened by taking Egypt. In that land, where labor was
cheap, genius and francs might build a fleet, courage and imagination
might sail over that dis- tant sea to India, and take from the British
colonial system its richest posses- sion. In 1803 Napoleon confessed to
Mme. de Remusat:</p>
<p>I do not know what would have happened to me had I not conceived the
happy thought of going to Egypt. When I embarked I did not know but that
I might be bidding an eternal farewell to France; but I had little doubt
that she would recall me. The charm of Oriental conquest drew my
thoughts away from Europe more than I should have believed possible.
64</p>
<p>The Directory fell in with his proposals, partly because it thought
it</p>
<p>would be safer if he were at a distance. Talleyrand concurred for
reasons still disputed; his mistress Mme. Grand alleged that he did it
to “favor his</p>
<p>108 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. V</p>
<p>English friends”— presumably by diverting to Egypt the army that was
threatening to invade England. 65 The Directory delayed consent because
the expedition would be costly, would consume men and materiel needed
for protection against England and Austria, and might bring Turkey (the
indolent sovereign of Egypt) into a new coalition against France. But
the rapid advance of the French army in Italy — the subjection of the
Papal States and the kingdom of Naples — brought succulent spoils to the
Direc- tory; and in April, 1798, with Napoleon’s approval, another
French army invaded Switzerland, set up the Helvetic Republic, exacted
“indemnities,” and sent money to Paris. Now the Egyptian dream could be
financed.</p>
<p>Napoleon began at once to issue detailed orders for a new armada.
Thir- teen ships of the line, seven frigates, thirty-five other
warships, 130 trans- ports, 16,000 seamen, 38,000 troops (many from the
Army of Italy), with necessary equipment and materiel, and a library of
287 volumes, were to assemble at Toulon, Genoa, Ajaccio, or
Civitavecchia; and scientists, schol- ars, and artists were happy to
accept invitations to what promised to be an exciting and historic union
of adventure and research. Among them were Monge the mathematician,
Fourier the physicist, Berthollet the chemist, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire
the biologist; and Tallien, having surrendered his wife to Barras, found
passage among the savants. They noted with pride that Napoleon now
signed his letters “Bonaparte, Member of the Institute and General-in-
chief.” 66 Bourrienne, who had joined Napoleon as secretary at
Campoformio in 1797, accompanied him on this voyage, and gave a detailed
account of its fate. Josephine too wanted to come along; Napoleon
allowed her to accompany him to Toulon, but he forbade her to board
ship. How- ever, he took with him her son Eugene de Beauharnais, who had
endeared himself to Napoleon by his modesty and competence, and by a
loyalty that became an undiscourageable devotion. Josephine mourned this
double de- parture, wondering whether she would ever see her son or her
husband again. From Toulon she went to Plombieres to take the “fertility
waters,” for now she, as well as Napoleon, wanted a child.</p>
<p>On May 19, 1798, the main fleet sailed from Toulon to bring medieval
romance into modern history.</p>

</ol>
<p>The purpose of the armada had been so well concealed that nearly all
the 54,000 men set out with no knowledge of their destination. In a
characteris- tic proclamation to the new “Army of the Orient” Napoleon
merely called it a “wing of the Army of England,” and asked his sailors
and warriors to trust him though he could not yet define their task. The
secrecy served some purpose: the British government was apparently
misled into thinking that the flotilla was preparing to fight its way
past Gibraltar and join in the</p>

<p>invasion of England. Nelson’s ships were lax in their watch on the
Mediter - ranean, and the French argosy evaded them.</p>
<p>On June 9 it sighted Malta. The Directory had bribed the grandmaster
and other dignitaries of the Knights of Malta* to make only a token
resis- tance; 67 as a result the French took the supposedly impregnable
fortress with the loss of only three men. Napoleon dallied there a week
to reorganize the administration of the island Gaulward. There Alfred de
Vigny, poet-to-be but then a child of two years, was introduced to the
conqueror, who raised him and kissed him; “when he lowered me carefully
to the de ck he had won one more slave.” 68 The godlike man, however,
was seasick nearly all the way to Alexandria. Meanwhile he studied the
Koran.</p>
<p>The fleet reached Alexandria July 1, 1798. The port was guarded by a
garrison, and a landing there would be costly; yet an early ana orderly
dis- embarkation was imperative if the squadron was not to be surprised
by Nel- son’s fleet. The neighboring surf was threateningly rough, but
Napoleon in person led a landing party of five thousand men upon an
unprotected beach. These, without cavalry or artillery, advanced at
night upon the garrison, overcame it at the cost of two hundred French
casualties, took possession of the city, and provided the protection
under which the ships deposited the soldiers and their armament upon
Egyptian soil.</p>
<p>Armed with this victory and a few words of Arabic, Napoleon persuaded
the local leaders to sit down with him in conference. He amused and then
impressed them by his knowledge of the Koran and his clever use of its
phrases and ideas. He pledged himself and his army to respect their
religion, laws, and possessions. He promised — if they would help him
with laborers and supplies — to win back for them the lands seized by
the Mameluke mer- cenaries who had made themselves masters of Egypt
under indolent dynas- ties. The Arabs half agreed, and on July 7
Napoleon bade his wondering army follow him across 1 50 miles of desert
to Cairo.</p>
<p>They had never experienced such heat, such thirst, such blinding
sand, such indefatigable insects, or such disabling dysentery. Bonaparte
partly quieted their complaints by sharing their hardships silently. On
July 10 they reached the Nile, drank their fill, and refreshed their
flesh. After five more days of marching, their vanguard sighted, near
the village of Kobrakit, an army of three thousand Mamelukes: “a
splendid body of mounted men” (Napoleon recalled them), “all gleaming
with gold and silver, armed with the best London carbines and pistols,
and the best sabers of the East, ri din g perhaps the best horses on the
Continent.” 69 Soon the Mameluke cavalry fell upon the French line,
front and flank, only to be felled by the musketry and artillery of the
French. Wounded in flesh and pride, the Mamelukes turned and fled.</p>
<p>On July 20, still eighteen miles from Cairo, the victors caught sight
of the Pyramids. That evening Napoleon learned that an army of six
thousand</p>

<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>mounted Mamelukes, under twenty-three district beys, had assembled at
Embaba, ready to challenge the infidel invaders. The next afternoon they
fell in full force upon the French in the crucial battle of the
Pyramids. There, if we may trust Napoleon’s memory, he told his
soldiers, “Forty centuries have their eyes upon you.” 70 Again the
French met the onslaught with cannon, musket fire, and fixed bayonets;
seventy of them died there, and fifteen hun- dred Mamelukes; many of the
defeated, in heedless flight, leaped into the Nile and were drowned. On
July 22 the Turkish authorities in Cairo sent Napoleon the keys of the
city in token of surrender. On July 23 he entered the picturesque
capital without any offensive display.</p>
<p>From that center he issued orders for the administration of Egypt by
Arab divans (committees) subject to his control. He prevented pillage by
his troops, and protected existing property rights, but he continued and
appropriated, for the support of his army, the taxes customarily levied
by the Mameluke conquerors. He sat down with native leaders, professed
respect for Islamic rites and art, recognized Allah as the one and only
god, and asked for Moslem aid in bringing a new prosperity to Egypt. He
summoned his scientists to design methods of eliminating plagues,
introducing new industries, improving Egyptian education and
jurisprudence, establishing postal and transport services, repairing
canals, controlling irrigation, and joining the Nile with the Red Sea.
In July, 1799, he organized local and French savants into the Institute
of Egypt, and set up spacious quarters for it in Cairo. It was these
scholars who prepared the twenty-four massive vol- umes financed and
published by the French government as Description de rtlgypte (1809-28).
One of these men, known to us only as Bouchard, found in 1799, in a town
thirty miles from Alexandria, the Rosetta Stone, whose inscription, in
two languages and three scripts (hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek)
enabled Thomas Young to begin (1814), and Jean-Frangois Champollion to
establish (1821), a method of translating hieroglyphic texts, thereby
opening up to “modem” Europe the astonishingly complex and mature
civilization of ancient Egypt. This was the chief — and the only sig-
nificant- result of Napoleon’s expedition.</p>
<p>For a while he was allowed to enjoy the pride of conquest and the
zest of administration. In later retrospect he told Mme. de Remusat:</p>
<p>The time which I passed in Egypt was the most delightful of my life….
In Egypt I found myself free from the wearisome restraints of
civilization. I dreamed all sorts of things, and I saw how all that I
dreamed might be realized. I created a religion. I pictured myself on
the road to Asia, mounted on an ele- phant, with a turban on my head,
and in my hand a new Koran, which I should compose according to my own
ideas…. I was to have attacked the English power in India, and renewed
my relations with old Europe by my con- quest…. Fate decided against my
dream. 71</p>
<p>Fate’s first blow was the information conveyed to him by an aide -de-
camp, Andoche Junot, that Josephine had taken a lover in Paris. The
great dreamer, with all his intellectual brilliance, had neglected to
consider how hard it would be for so tropical a plant as Josephine to go
for many months</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>1 1 1</p>
<p>without some tangible appreciation of her charms. For some days he
mourned and raged. Then, on July 26, 1798, he sent a despondent letter
to his brother Joseph:</p>
<p>I may be in France again in two months…. There is plenty to worry me
at home…. Your friendship means a lot to me; were I to lose it, and see
you betraying me, I should be a complete misanthrope….</p>
<p>I want you to arrange to have a country place ready for me when I
return, either in Burgundy or near Paris. 1 am counting on spending the
winter there, and seeing no one. 1 am sick of society. I need solitude,
isolation. My feelings are dried up, and 1 am bored with public display.
I am tired of glory at twenty-nine; it has lost its charm; and there is
nothing left for me but com- plete egotism….</p>
<p>Goodbye, my one and only friend…. My love to your wife and
Jerome.</p>
<p>He found some distraction by taking as a mistress a young Frenchwoman
who had followed her officer husband to Egypt. Pauline Foures could not
resist the interest that Napoleon took in her gay beauty; she returned
his smiles, and made no insuperable protest when he cleared his path by
sending M. Foures on a mission to Paris. When the husband learned the
reason for his distinction he returned to Cairo and divorced Pauline.
Napoleon too thought of divorce, and played with the idea of marrying
Pauline and beget- ting an heir; but he reckoned without Josephine’s
tears. Pauline was solaced with a substantial gift, and survived the
mishap by sixty-nine years.</p>
<p>A week after Junot’s revelation, a major disaster imprisoned the Army
of the Orient in its victory. On leaving his fleet at Alexandria,
Napoleon (ac- cording to Napoleon) had ordered Vice-Admiral
Frangois-Paul Brueys to unload all materiel useful to the troops, and
then to sail as soon as possible to French-held Corfu; every measure
must be taken to avoid interception by the British. Bad weather delayed
Brueys’ departure; meanwhile he anchored</p>
<p>When the news of this overwhelming reverse reached him at Cairo,
Bona- parte realized that his conquest of Egypt had been made
meaningless. His tired adventurers were now shut off, by both land and
sea, from French aid, and must soon be at the mercy of a hostile
population and an uncongenial</p>

<p>environment. It is to their young commander’s credit that in his own
grief he found time to console the widow of his vice-admiral:</p>
<p>Cairo, August 19, 1798</p>
<p>Your husband was killed by a cannon ball whilst fighting on board his
ship. He died honorably, and without suffering, as every soldier would
wish to die.</p>
<p>Your sorrow touches me to the quick. It is a dread moment when we are
parted from one we love…. If there were no reason for living it would be
better to die. But when second thoughts come, and you press your
children to your heart, your nature is revived by tears and tenderness,
and you live for the sake of your offspring. Yes, Madame, you will weep
with them, you will nurture them in infancy, you will educate their
youth; you will speak to them of their father and your grief, of their
love and the Republic’s. And when you have linked your soul to the world
again through the mutual affection of mother and child, I want you to
count as of some value my friendship, and the lively interest that I
shall always take in the wife of my friend. Be assured that there are
men… who can turn grief into hope because they feel so intimately the
troubles of the heart. 72</p>
<p>Adversities multiplied. Almost every day there were attacks upon the
French settlements by Arabs, Turks, or Mamelukes unreconciled to their
new masters. On October 16 the populace of Cairo itself erupted in
revolt; the French suppressed it at some cost to their morale; and
Napoleon, aban- doning for a time the role of an amiable conqueror,
ordered the decapita- tion of every armed rebel. 73</p>
<p>Hearing that Turkey was preparing an army to reach and reclaim Egypt,
he determined to meet the challenge by leading thirteen thousand of his
men into Syria. They set out on February 10, 179 9, captured El ’Arish,
and crossed the Sinai Desert. Napoleon’s letter of February 27 described
some aspects of that ordeal: heat, thirst, “brackish water, often none
at all; we ate</p>
<p>At Jaffa (March 3) they were stopped by a walled city, a hostile
popu- lace, and a citadel defended by 2,700 virile Turks. Napoleon sent
them an emissary to offer terms; these were rejected. On March 7, French
sappers made a breach in the wall; French troops rushed in, killed the
resisting popu- lation, and pillaged the town. Napoleon sent Eugene de
Beauhamais to re- store order; he offered a safe exit to all who would
surrender; the citadel troops, to save the town from further desolation,
gave up their arms, and were brought as prisoners to Napoleon. He threw
up his hands in dismay. “What can I do with them?” he a sked. He could
not take 2,700 prisoners along on the march; his men had all they could
do to find food and drink for themselves. He could not spare a guard
numerous enough to take the Turks to imprisonment in Cairo. If he set
them free there was nothing to prevent them from fighting the French
again. Napoleon called a council of his officers and asked them for
their judgment. They decided that the best course was to kill the
prisoners. Some three hundred were spared; 2,441 (in- cluding civilians
of all ages and both sexes) were shot, or were bayoneted to save
ammunition. 74</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>

<p>The invaders marched, and on March 1 8 they reached the heavily
fortified town of Acre. The Turkish resistance was led by Djezzar Pasha,
aided by Antoine de Phelippeaux — who had been Napoleon’s fellow student
at Bri - enne. The French laid siege, without the siege artillery that
had been sent them by sea from Alexandria; an English squadron under Sir
William Sidney Smith captured those weapons, delivered them to the fort,
and then kept the garrison supplied with food and materiel during the
siege. On May 20, after two months’ effort and heavy losses, Napoleon
ordered a retreat to Egypt. “Phelippeaux,” he mourned, “held me back
before Acre. If it had not been for him I would have been master of the
key to the Orient. I would have gone on to Constantinople, and would
have restored the Eastern Empire.” 75 In 1803, not foreseeing 1812, he
said to Mme. de Remusat, “m y imagination died at Acre. I shall never
allow it to interfere with me again.” 76</p>
<p>The return along the coast was a succession of tragic days, with
marches sometimes of eleven hours between wells, to find almost
undrinkable water that poisoned the body and hardly quenched thirst. A
heavy burden of wounded or plague-stricken men slowed the procession.
Napoleon asked the physicians to administer fatal doses of opium to the
incurably diseased; they refused, and Napoleon withdrew his suggestion.
77 He ordered all horses to be turned over to the task of carrying the
sick, and gave to his officers the example of marching on foot. 78 On
June 14, after a march of three hundred miles from Acre in twenty-six
days, the exhausted army made a triumphal entry into Cairo, displaying
seventeen enemy flags and sixteen Turkish offi- cers captured, as proof
that the expedition had been a proud success.</p>
<p>On July 1 1 a hundred vessels deposited at Abukir an army of Turks
com- missioned to drive the French from Egypt. Napoleon marched north
with his best troops, and inflicted upon the Turks so overwhelming a
defeat (July 25) that many of them rushed to death in the sea rather
than face the onrushing French cavalry.</p>
<p>From English newspapers sent to him by Sidney Smith, Napoleon was
astonished to learn that a Second Coalition of the Powers had driven the
French out of Germany and had recaptured nearly all of Italy from the
Alps to Calabria. 79 The whole edifice of his victories had collapsed in
a series of disasters from the Rhine and the Po to Abukir and Acre; and
now, in a humiliating checkmate, he found himself and his decimated
legions bot- tled up in a hostile blind alley where only a little time
would be needed for their annihilation.</p>
<p>About the middle of July he received from the Directory an order,
sent him on May 26, to return to Paris at once. 80 He resolved to get
back to France somehow, despite the encompassing British; to forge a
path to power; and to displace the fumbling leaders who had allowed all
his gains in Italy to be so quickly annulled. Back in Cairo he arranged
affairs military and administrative, and appointed the reluctant Kleber
to command the bat- tered remains of the Egyptian dream. The treasury of
the army was empty, and was six million francs in debt; the pay of the
soldiers was four million in arrears; their number, their morale, were
falling with every day, while</p>

<p>(CHAP. V</p>

<p>heir reluctant hosts were increasing in strength, and waiting with
silent pa- tience for another opportunity to revolt. At any time the
governments of Turkey and Great Britain might send to Egypt a force
that, with native aid, could sooner or later bring the French to a
helpless surrender. Napoleon knew all this, and could only excuse his
departure by claiming that he was needed in Paris and had been ordered
to return. When he bade goodbye to the troops (to each of whom he had
promised six hectares of land after a triumphant homecoming) he vowed,
“If I have the good fortune to reach France the rule of those babblers
[bavards] will be finished,” 81 and aid would come to these immured
conquerors. It never came.</p>
<p>Two frigates — the Muiron and the Carrere — had survived the
holocaust at Abukir. Napoleon sent word to have them prepared for an
attempt to reach France. On August 23, 1799, he, with Bourrienne,
Berthollet, and Monge, boarded the Muiron; Generals Lannes, Murat,
Denon, and others followed on the Carrere , 82 By permission of fog and
the great god Chance they es- caped all the eyes and scouts of Nelson’s
fleet. They could not stop at Malta, for the victorious British had
seized that stronghold on February 9. On October 9 the ships anchored
off Frejus, and Napoleon and his aides were rowed to shore at
St.-Raphael. Now it was to be aut Caesar aut nullus — either Caesar or
nobody.</p>

<p>The successes of the French armies — culminating in the submission of
Prussia at Basel in 1795, of Austria at Campoformio in 1797, and of
Naples and Switzerland in 1798 — softened the French government into an
almost Oriental lassitude. The two chambers of the Corps Legislatif
submitted to the Directory, and the five Directors acknowledged the
leadership of Barras, Rewbeli, and Larevelliere. These men seem to have
adopted the motto that legend ascribed to Pope Leo X : “Since God has
given us this office, let us enjoy it.” Blessed with apparent security
by a period of relative peace, and taught by experience that
governmental positions are especially insecure in revolutions, they
feathered their nests for their fall. When isolated England offered
peace in July, 1797, it was told that this could be arranged by the
payment of ,£500,000 to Rewbeli and Barras; and apparently a bribe of £
400,000 was exacted from Portugal for the peace granted it in August of
that year. 83 Rewbeli was rapacious, and Barras needed an elastic income
to keep Mme. Tallien and his associates in good humor, and to maintain
his luxurious apartment in the Luxembourg Palace. 84 Talleyrand, as
minister of foreign affairs, seldom lost an opportunity to make the
Revolution finance his aristocratic tastes; Barras calculated that
Talleyrand’s dps of - ten exceeded 100,000 livres in a year. 88 In
October, 1797, three American commissioners came to Paris to settle a
dispute about American vessels cap- tured by French privateers;
according to President John Adams, they were</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>”5</p>
<p>old that agreement could be reached by a loan of 32 million florins
to the Directors, and by a private douceur of £ 50,000 to Talleyrand.
86</p>
<p>The ruling triumvirate faced so many problems that most of their
faults might be forgiven them — at least an evening’s refreshment in the
smiles of fair women. They averted another fiscal collapse by collecting
traditional taxes more insistently, restoring defunct taxes like
transport tolls, and levying new taxes — as on licenses and stamps,
windows and doors. They presided over a nation torn in body and soul, in
province and class, by conflicting aims: nobles and plutocrats, Vendean
Catholics, Jacobin atheists, Babeuvian socialists, merchants demanding
liberty, a populace dreaming of equality and living on the edge of
starvation; luckily the good harvests of 1796 and 1798 shortened the
bread lines.</p>
<p>The victory of the “liberal” over the monarchical Directors in 1 797
had been achieved by enlisting the support of the radicals. In partial
payment therefor the triumphant trio censored the bourgeois-leaning
press and theater, rigged elections, made arrests without warning, and
renewed the Hebertist campaign against religion. Education of the young
was taken from nuns and entrusted to lay instructors who were ordered to
keep all super- natural ideas out of their teaching. 87 In twelve months
of 1797-98, a total of 1,448 priests were deported from France, 8,235
from Belgium. Of 193 ec- clesiastics deported on the ship Decade only
thirty-nine were alive two years later. 88</p>
<p>While internal conflict flourished, external danger rose. In Belgium,
Hol- land, and the Rhineland the rapacity of the Directory made new
enemies of new friends; taxes were high, youths resisted conscription,
forced loans in- furiated the influential, seizure of gold and silver
and art from the churches alienated clergy and people alike. In three
years the Directory took in from these lands and Italy two billion
livres. 89 After the departure of Bonaparte for Egypt “the Directory
continued a policy of conquest, or rather of</p>
<p>rapine, occupying territorie s for money’s sake, pillaging the
population, exacting ‘indemnities’ from local governments, making France
an object of execration.” 90 “The French Republic,” said the monarchist
Mallet du Pan, “is eating Europe leaf by leaf, like the head of an
articho ke. It revolutionizes nations that it may despoil them, and it
despoils them that it may subsist.” 91 War had become profitable, peace
would be ruinous. Suspecting that the ship of state was sailing into a
storm, Talleyrand resigned his ministry (July 20, 1798), and retired to
spend his spoils. 92</p>
<p>Napoleon had given a stimulating example of how war could be made to
pay, and his reckless operations were in part responsible for the
military woes that befell France in the decline of the Directory. He had
too quickly and superficially subjected Italy to a French protectorate,
and had left his conquests in the hands of subordinates who lacked his
soothing subtlety and diplomatic skill. He had reckoned too
optimistically on the willingness of the new Italian republics to pay
France for their freedom from Austria. He had underestimated the vigor
with which England would resist the French occupation of Malta and
Egypt. How long would flouted Turkey resist the</p>
<p>Il6 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. V</p>
<p>invitations of its ancient enemies, Russia and Austria, to join them
in disci- plining these nouveaux-riches revolutionaries? How long would
the parti- tioning of Poland keep Russia, Prussia, and Austria too busy
in the east to restore the divine right of kings in the west?</p>
<p>Nearly all the monarchs of Europe watched for an opportunity to renew
the attack upon France. They saw it when Napoleon took mmself and</p>
<p>35.000 of France’s best troops to Egypt; they seized it when that
army seemed safely impriso ned by Nelson’s victory at Abukir. Czar Paul
I ac - cepted election as grandmaster of the Knights of Malta, and
pledged himself to drive the French from that pivotal isle. He offered
his aid to Ferdinand IV in recapturing Naples. He dreamed of finding
friendly ports for Russian ships in Naples, Malta, and Alexandria, and
thereby making Russia a Medi- terranean power. On December 29, 1798, he
signed an alliance with England. When Emperor Francis II gave free
passage through Austrian territory for a Russian army moving toward the
Rhine, France declared war upon Aus- tria (March 12, 1799). Austria
thereupon joined Russia, Turkey, Naples, Portugal, and England in the
Second Coalition against France.</p>
<p>The weakness of the Directory was exposed in this conflict, which it
had provoked and could have foreseen. It was tardy in preparation,
unsuccessful in war finance, and clumsy in conscription. It called up
200,000 men, and found only 143,000 of them fit for service; of them
only 97,000 obeyed the summons; thousands of these deserted on the way,
so that only 74,000 reached their allotted regiments. There they found a
chaotic inadequacy of clothing, equipment, and arms. The spirit that had
once animated the armies of the republic was gone from these men who had
experienced the years of national disorder and disillusionment. The
ruthless determination and disci- pline with which the Committee of
Public Safety had planned and waged war in 1793 were missing in the
Directory that led France in 1798.</p>
<p>There were some initial and deceiving successes. Piedmont and Tuscany
were conquered, occupied, and taxed. The victory of King Ferdinand IV in
driving the French out of Rome was annulled by the French under Jean
-Etienne Championnet, who entered Rome on December 15. Ferdinand and his
court, with Lady Hamilton and twenty million ducats, retreated to
Palermo under the protection of Nelson’s fleet. Championnet captured</p>
<p>320.000 to 170,000. The French generals, despite the brilliance of
Massena’s operations in Switzerland, lacked the ability of Bonaparte to
overcome su- perior numbers with superior strategy, tactics, and
discipline. Jourdan was defeated at Stockach (March 25, 1799), retreated
to Strasbourg, and re- signed. Scherer was defeated at Magnano (April
5), retreated in disorder, lost nearly all his army, and turned his
command over to Moreau. Then a veritable “devil of a man,” Aleksandr
Suvorov, arrived with eighteen thou - sand Russians, and led them and
some Austrian divisions in a ferocious cam- paign that wrested from the
French one after another of the regions that</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>“7</p>
<p>Napoleon had won in 1796-97; he entered Milan victorious on April 27;
Moreau fell back to Genoa; Napoleon’s Cisalpine Republic came to an
early end. Left perilously alone with his small army in Switzerland,
Massena aban- doned his conquests there, and withdrew to the Rhine.</p>
<p>Having so easily restored Lombardy to Austria, Suvorov marched out
from Milan to meet a French force coming up from Naples and Rome; at the
Trebbia (June 17-19, 1799) he so overwhelmed it that only a shat- tered
remnant reached Genoa. The Parthenopean Republic came to an early end;
Ferdinand resumed his Neapolitan throne, and established a reign of
terror in which hundreds of democrats were put to death. Joubert, placed
in command of all surviving French forces in Italy, led them against
Suvorov at Novi (August 15); he exposed himself recklessly, and was
killed at the outset of the battle; the French fought bravely but in
vain; twelve thousand of them fell on that field; and France, learning
of this culminating catastro- phe, realized that its hard-won frontiers
were crumbling, and that Suvorov ’s Russians might soon be on French
soil. The imagination of the populace in Alsace and Provence pictured
him and his men as “giant barbarians,” as a tidal wave of savage Slavs
pouring into the towns and hamlets of France.</p>
<p>The country, so recently proud of its strength and its victories, was
now in a state of confusion and fear rivaling that which in 1792 had led
to the September Massacres. The Vendee was again in revolt; Belgium was
rising against its French overlords; forty-five of the eighty-six
departments of France were nearing a complete breakdown of government
and morale. Armed youths were fighting the officials sent to conscript
them; municipal officers and tax collectors were murdered; hundreds of
brigands were ter- rorizing merchants and travelers on city streets and
country roads; criminals overpowered the gendarmes, opened the jails,
released the prisoners, and added them to their ranks; every estate,
abbey, and home was subject to pil- lage; the “Great Terror” of 1794 had
returned. The nation looked hopefully for protection by the men it had
sent to Paris; but the Councils had sur- rendered to the Directory, and
the Directory seemed but another usurping oligarchy, ruling by bribery,
chicanery, and force.</p>
<p>In May, 1799, the once-abbe Sieyes — who, ten long years ago, had
sparked the Revolution by asking “What is the Third Estate?” and had
answered that it was, and should call itself, the nation — was drawn out
of his cautious obscurity, and was elected to the Directory; for, as a
maker of constitutions, he had become identified with law and order. He
agreed to serve, on condi- tion that Rewbell would resign; Rewbell
resigned with a consolatory sever- ance pay of 100,000 francs. 93 On
June 18 a strong minority of Jacobins in the two legislative chambers
forced Directors Larevelliere, Treilhard, and Merlin to yield their
places to Louis-Jerome Gohier, Jean-Frangois Moulin, and Roger Ducos.
Fouche was made minister of police, and Robert Lindet became head of the
Treasury; both were resurrections from the Committee of Public Safety.
The Jacobin Club in Paris was reopened, and heard praises of Robespierre
and Babeuf. 94</p>
<p>On June 28 the Legislature, under Jacobin influence, levied a
forced</p>
<p>1 1 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>loan of a hundred million livres in the form of a tax ranging from
thirty to seventy-five percent upon incomes above a moderate level.
Prosperous citi- zens hired lawyers to find loopholes in the law, and
listened amiably to plots for the overthrow of the government. On July
12 the Jacobins secured passage of a Law of Hostages: every commune in
France was ordered to compile a roster of local citizens related to the
outlawed nobility, and to keep them under surveillance; for every
robbery committed these hostages were to be fined; for every murder of a
“patriot” (one loyal to the existing regime) four hostages were to be
deported. This decree was met with a cry of horror from the upper
classes, and with no compensating welcome from the commonalty.</p>
<p>After a decade of excitement, class strife, foreign wars, political
upsets, lawless tribunals, tyrannical spoliations, executions, and
massacres, nearly all of France was sick of the Revolution. Those who
looked back sadly to the “good old days” of Louis XVI felt that only a
king could bring France back to order and sanity. Those who cherished
Catholic Christianity prayed for the time when they would be freed from
rule by atheists. Even some gradu- ate skeptics who had shed all
supernatural belief had come to doubt that a moral code unsupported by a
religious faith could resist unfettered passions and antisocial impulses
rooted in centuries of insecurity, hunting, and sav- agery; many
creedless parents were sending their children to church, prayer,
Confession, and First Communion as hopeful sources of modesty, family
discipline, and mental peace. Peasants and bourgeois proprietors who
owed their lands to the Revolution, and wanted to keep them, had come to
hate the government that so often came to tax their crops or conscript
their sons. Town workers were clamoring for bread even more desperately
than be- fore the fall of the Bastille; they saw merchants,
manufacturers, speculators, politicians, Directors, living in luxury;
they had come to look upon the Revolution as merely the replacement of
the nobility by the bourgeoisie as the masters and profiteers of the
state. But their bourgeois masters too were discontent. The unsafe and
neglected roads made travel and commerce toil- some and hazardous; the
forced loans and high taxes discouraged investment and enterprise; in
Lyons thirteen thousand of fifteen thousand shops had been abandoned as
profitless, adding thousands of men and women to the unemployed. Le
Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles had been ruined by the war and the
consequent British blockade. The diminishing minority that still talked
of liberty could hardly associate it with the Revolution, which had
destroyed so many liberties, had passed so many terrifying laws, and had
sent so many men and women to prison or the guillotine. Women, except
the wives, mistresses, and daughters of the old and the new rich, moved
anxiously from one shopping line to another, wondering would the stock
of goods run out, would their sons, brothers, or husbands ever return
from the war, would the war ever end. Soldiers accustomed to violence,
theft, and hatred, suffering not only from defeat but from the shortage
and shoddi- ness of supplies, were soured by repeated revelations of
corruption in the men who led or fed or clothed them; when they came
home or to Paris</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>II 9</p>
<p>hey found similar dishonesty in society, commerce, industry, finance,
and government; why should they let themselves be killed for so
tarnished a dream? The mirage of a bright new world receded and vanished
as the Revolution marched on.</p>
<p>Some spirits were raised for a while by news that the Allies had
quarreled and parted, and had been beaten back in Switzerland and the
Netherlands; that Massena had recovered the initiative and had cut a
Russian army in two at Zurich (August 26, 1799), that the terrible Slavs
were in retreat, and Russia had left the Coalition. Frenchmen began to
wonder what if some able general like Massena, Moreau, Bemadotte, or,
best of all, Bonaparte, safely back from Egypt, should lead a battalion
into Paris, throw out the politicians, and give France order and
security, even at the cost of liberty? Most Frenchmen had come to the
conclusion that only a centralized gov- ernment under one authoritative
leader could end the chaos of revolution, and give the country the order
and security of civilized life.</p>

<li>NAPOLEON TAKES CHARGE: THE l8TH BRUMAIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>(NOVEMBER 9), 1 799</p>
<p>Sieyes agreed. Studying his fellow Directors, he saw that none of
them — not even the crafty Barras — had in him the combination of
intellect, vision, and will needed to bring France to sanity and unity.
He was pregnant with a constitution, but he wanted a general to aid him
in its birth and serve him as his arm. He had thought of Joubert, but
now Joubert was dead. He sent for Moreau, and almost persuaded him to be
the “man on horseback”; but when they learned that Napoleon was
returning from Egypt, Moreau told Sieyes: “There is your man; he will
make your coup d’etat much be tter than I could.” 95 Sieyes pondered;
Napoleon could be the man, but would he accept Sieyes and the new
constitution as his guides?</p>
<p>On October 13 the Directors notified the Councils that Bonaparte had
landed near Frejus; the members rose in acclamation. For three days and
nights the people of Paris celebrated the news with drinking in the
taverns and singing in the streets. At every town on the route from the
coast to the capital the populace and its masters turned out to greet
the man who seemed to them the symbol and assurance of victory; they had
not yet heard of the debacle in Egypt. In several centers, reported the
Moniteur, “the crowd was such that traffic could hardly advance.” 96 In
Lyons a play was staged in his honor, and an orator told him, “Go and
fight the enemy, defeat him, and we will make you king.” 97 But the
litde general, silent and somber, was thinking how he should deal with
Josephine.</p>
<p>When he reached Paris (October 16), he went directly to the house</p>
<p>which he had bought in the street which had been renamed, in his
honor, the Rue de la Victoire. He had hoped to find his errant wife
there, and to dismiss her from his life. She was not there, and for two
reasons. First, on April 21, 1799, while he was besieging Acre, she had
bought a 300-acre</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>estate, Malmaison, some ten miles down the Seine from Paris; Barras
had advanced her the 50,000 francs as the initial payment on the
300,000-francs cost; and Captain Hippolyte Charles was her first guest
in the roomy cha- teau. 98 Second, she and her daughter had left Paris
four days before to drive toward Lyons in the hope of meeting Bonaparte
on the way. When Jose- phine and Hortense discovered that Napoleon had
chosen an alternative route, they turned back, though literally sick of
travel, and retraced two hundred miles to the capital. In the interim
her aged father-in-law, the Mar- quis de Beauharnais, came to Napoleon
to plead her cause: “Whatever her faults, forget them; do not cast
dishonor upon my white head, and upon a family that holds you in honor.”
99 Bonaparte’s brothers urged him to di - vorce his wife, for his family
resented her power over him; but Barras warned him that a public scandal
would hurt ms political career.</p>
<p>When the exhausted mother and daughter arrived at 3 Rue de la
Victoire (October 18), Eugene met them on the landing, and warned them
to ex- pect a storm. Letting him attend to his sister, Josephine climbed
the stairs and knocked at the door of Napoleon’s room. He answered that
he was resolved never to see her again. She sank down upon the stairs
and wept until Eugene and Hortense raised her and led her back to make a
united appeal. Napoleon later reported: “I was profoundly stirred. I
could not bear the sobs of those two children. I asked myself, should
they be made the victims of their mother’s failing? I reached out,
caught hold of Eugene’s arm and drew him back to me. Then Hortense came…
with her mother…. What was there to say? One cannot be human without
being heir to human weaknesses.” 100</p>
<p>In those brooding days he kept out of the public eye; he knew that a
public man must not be too public. At home and abroad he wore civilian
dress, to discourage rumors that the Army was planning to seize the gov-
ernment. He made two visits: one to pay his respects to the
eighty-year-old Mme. Helvetius at Auteuil; the other to the Institute.
There he talked of the Egyptian expedition as having been undertaken in
large part in the inter- ests of science; Berthollet and Monge supported
him; Laplace, Lagrange, Cabanis, and many others listened to him as to a
scientist and a philoso- pher. 101 At this meeting he encountered
Sieyes, and won him with one re- mark: “We have no government because we
have no constitution, or at least not the one we need; your genius must
give us one.” 102</p>
<p>Soon his home became a center of secret negotiations. He received
visitors from Left and Right. He promised the Jacobins to preserve the
republic and defend the interests of the masses; but also, he later
frankly declared, “I received the agents of the Bourbons.” 103 However,
he kept himself apart from any faction, especially the Army. General
Bernadotte, who had some notion of heading the government himself,
advised him to stay out of poli- tics and be content with another
military command. Napoleon listened with more satisfaction to civilians
like Sieyes, who advised him to take over the government and inaugurate
a new constitution. This might require stretch- ing or breaking a law or
two; but the Council of Ancients, alarmed by a</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>1 2 I</p>
<p>Jacobin revival, would wink at a little illegality; and the Council
of Five Hundred, despite its strong Jacobin minority, had recently
elected Lucien Bonaparte its president. Of the five Directors, Sieyes
and Ducos pledged themselves to Napoleon; Talleyrand undertook to
persuade Barras to retire on his laurels and loot; Gohier, president of
the Directory, was half in love with Josephine, and could be immobilized
by her smiles. 104 Some bankers probably sent assurance of friendly
francs. 105</p>
<p>In the first week of November a rumor spread through Paris that the
Jacobins were preparing an uprising of the populace. Mme. de Stael took
the report seriously enough to prepare for a quick exit if violence
should break out. 106 On November 9 (the henceforth famous eighteenth
day of the month Brumaire) the Council of Ancients, using its
constitutional powers, ordered both itself and the Council of Five
Hundred to transfer their assem- blies, on the morrow, to the royal
palace in suburban St.-Cloud. Stretching its constitutional powers, it
appointed Bonaparte commander of the Paris garrison, and bade him come
at once to the Ancients in the Tuileries and take the oath of service.
He came, escorted by sixty officers, and pledged himself in terms
sufficiently general to allow some latitude of later interpre- tation:
“We want a republic based on liberty, equality, and the sacred prin -
ciples of national representation. We will have it, I swear!” 107</p>
<p>Emerging from the hall, he told the assembled troops, “The Army is re
- united with me, and I am reunited with the Corps Legislatif.” At this
junc - ture one Bottot, secretary to Barras, brought to Napoleon a
message from the once powerful Director, asking for a safe-conduct for
exit from Paris. In a voice which he hoped the soldiers and civilians
would hear, Napoleon overwhelmed poor Bottot with an apostrophe that was
almost a sentence of death upon the Directory: “What have you done with
this France which I left you in its full splendor? I left you peace, and
I find war; I left you vic- tories, and I find defeats! I left you
millions from Italy; I find everywhere spoliation and misery. What have
you done with the hundred thousand Frenchmen whom I knew, my companions
in glory? They are dead.”</p>
<p>Napoleon’s auditors did not know that he was borrowing some of these
lines from a Grenoble Jacobin; they felt their force, and long treasured
them in memory as a justification of the coup that was to follow. Then,
fearing that his words would arouse Barras to antagonism, he took Bottot
aside and assured him that his personal sentiments about the Director
remained un- changed. 108 He mounted his horse, reviewed the troops, and
returned to Josephine all atremble with his success as an orator.</p>
<p>On November 10 General Lefebvre led five hundred men of the Paris
garrison to St.-Cloud, and stationed them near the royal palace.
Napoleon and some of his favorite officers followed; and after them came
Sieyes, Ducos, Talleyrand, Bourrienne. They watched the Council of
Ancients assemble in the Gallery of Mars, and the Council of Five
Hundred in the adjoining Orangerie. As soon as Lucien Bonaparte called
the Five Hundred to order he was met with protests against the presence
of soldiers around the palace; cries arose of “No dictatorship! Down
with the dictators! We</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>are free men here; the bayonets do not frighten us!” A motion was
presented</p>
<p>The Ancients also took their time, on the ground that it had to wait
for the Five Hundred to submit proposals. Napoleon, fretting in a nearby
room, feared that unless some decisive action were soon taken his cause
would be lost. Between Berthier and Bourrienne he made his way to the
rostrum of the Ancients, and attempted to stir these old men into
action. But he, who was so eloquent in proclamations, and so decisive in
conversation, was too pent up with emotions and ideas to extemporize an
orderly address to a legislative body. He spoke abruptly, vehemently,
almost incoherently:</p>
<p>You are on a volcano!… Allow me to speak with the freedom of a
soldier…. I was at peace in Paris when you called upon me to execute
your com- mands…. I gather my comrades; we have flown to your rescue….
People cover me with calumnies; they talk of Caesar, of Cromwell, of
military gov- ernment…. Time presses; it is essential that you take
prompt measures…. The Republic has no government; only the Council of
Ancients remains. Let it take measures, let it speak; I will be your
agent in action. Let us save liberty! Let us save equality ! 109</p>
<p>A deputy interrupted him: “And the constitution?” Napoleon replied
with angry passion, “The constitution? You yourselves have destroyed it;
you violated it on the eighteenth Fructidor; you violated it on the
twenty- second Floreal; you violated it on the thirtieth Prairial. It no
longer holds any man’s respect.” When challenged to name the men behind
the alleged Jacobin plot, he named Barras and Moulin; asked for
evidence, he faltered, and could think of nothing more convincing than
an appeal to the soldiers who stood at the entrance: “You, my brave
comrades, who accompany me, brave grenadiers,… if any orator, brought by
a foreigner, dares pronounce the words Hors la loi, let the lightning of
war crush him instantly.” 110 Ques - tions and objections overwhelmed
the speaker; his words became more con- fused; his aides came to his
rescue and escorted him from the chamber. 111 He appeared to have ruined
his enterprise.</p>
<p>He resolved to try again, and this time to face the enemy directly —
the Jacobin-colored Five Hundred. Escorted by four grenadiers, he made
his way into the Orangerie. The deputies were angered by the military
display; the hall resounded with cries of “A bas le dictateur! A has le
tyran! Hors la loi! [Outlaw him!]”; this was the cry that had
precipitated the fall and death of Robespierre. A motion to declare
Napoleon an outlaw was made; Lucien Bonaparte, chairman, refused to put
it to a vote; resigning the presi- dency of the Five Hundred to a
friend, he mounted the tribune, and spoke in defense of his brother.
Excited deputies surrounded Napoleon. “Is it for this that you won your
victories?” one asked; others p ressed upon him so closely that he was
near to fainting; the grenadiers forced their way to him and led him out
of the hall. Revived by the open air, he mounted a horse and appealed to
the troops, who stood amazed by his torn clothing and</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>THE DIRECTORY</p>
<p>1 2 3</p>
<p>disheveled hair. “Soldiers, may I count upon you?” he asked. “Yes,”
many said, but others hesitated. Napoleon was again confused; his grand
design again seemed shattered.</p>
<p>He was saved by his brother. Lucien, hurrying from the Orangerie,</p>
<p>jumped upon the nearest horse, rode up beside Napoleon, and spoke to
the disorganized guardsmen with authority, eloquence, and considerable
bending of the truth:</p>
<p>As president of the Council of Five Hundred I declare to you that the
im- mense majority of the Council is at this moment terrorized by some
stiletto- armed representatives who besiege the tribune and threaten
death to their colleagues…. I declare that these audacious brigands,
doubtless paid by Eng- land, have rebelled against the Council of the
Ancients, and have dared to speak of outlawing the general charged with
executing the Ancients’ decree.</p>
<p>Lucien grasped a sword, pointed it at Napoleon’s breast, and swore
that if his brother should ever attack the liberty of the French people
he would kill him with his own hand.</p>
<p>Thereupon Napoleon gave orders for the drums to sound, and for the
troops to invade the Orangerie and disperse the disobedient deputies.
Mu- rat and Lefebvre led the way, shouting; the grenadiers followed,
crying, “Bravo! A bas les Jacobins! A bas les ’93! Cest le passage du
Rubicon!” When the deputies saw the bayonets advancing upon them, most
of them fled, some by jumping from windows; a minority gathered around
Lucien. That triumphant master of ceremonies proceeded to the Ancients
and ex- plained to them that the Five Hundred had experienced a healing
purge. The Ancients, glad to survive, passed a decree replacing the
Directory with three “Provisional Consuls”— Bonaparte, Sieyes, and
Ducos. About a hun- dred of the Five Hundred were organized into a
second chamber. Both chambers then adjourned till February 20, 1800,
leaving the Consuls to write a new constitution and to govern France.
“Tomorrow,” Napoleon said to Bourrienne, “we shall sleep at the
Luxembourg.” 113</p>
