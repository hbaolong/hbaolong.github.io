<p>Merrie England’</p>
<p>1558-1625</p>
<p>I. AT WORK</p>
<p>W HAT sort of England was it that gave Elizabeth her power and</p>
<p>victory, and Shakespeare his language and inspiration? What kind</p>
<p>of people were these Elizabethan Englishmen, so recklessly
aggressive, so outspoken and exuberant? How did they live and labor,
dress and think, love and build and sing?</p>
<p>In 1581 they numbered some five million. Most of them were farmers.
Most of these were sharecroppers; some were tenants paying a fixed rent;
a rising proportion were freeholding yeomen. Enclosures of common lands
continued, as pasturage proved more profitable than tillage. Serfdom was
almost gone, but evictions of tenants by enclosures and combinations
were generating an unhappy class of laborers who sold their brawn pre-
cariously from farm to farm, or from shop to shop in the expanding
towns.</p>
<p>Except for the capital, however, the towns were still small. Norwich
and Bristol, the largest after London, had little more than twenty thou-
sand souls each. There was a pleasant side to the matter: townsmen were
neighborly, and even in London most homes had gardens, or were near to
open fields, and could gather the varied flowers that Shakespeare
litanied. Houses were heated by burning v’^ood; most industry used char-
coal as fuel power; but the price of firewood soared in the sixteenth
cen- tury, and the rising demand of the towns for coal prompted
landowners to explore the deposits of their soil. German operators were
imported to im- prove mining and metallurgy. Elizabeth forbade the use
of coal in London, but her imperative proved less categorical than
economic need.^ Textile shops expanded as weavers and fullers fled to
England from Alva’s oppres - sion in the Netherlands; Huguenots brought
from France their artisan and mercantile skills; it was an Englishman,
however, the Reverend William Lee, who invented (1589) the semi-
automatic “stocking frame” for knit - ting. Fishing was the most
flourishing industry, for the government en- couraged it to inure men to
seamanship and provide a reserve for the navy; hence Elizabeth, bowing
to the Roman Church, ordered her people to ab- stain from meat on two
days a week and on the traditional fast days of Lent. The guilds,
hamstrung by their medieval regulations, continued to lose</p>

<p>markets in this individualistic and innovating age. Clever
promoters</p>
<p>gathered capital, bought up raw materials, distributed these to shops
and families, bought the product, and sold it for all that the traffic
would bear. Capitalism in England began in the home, with the work of
father, mother, daughter, and son for the entrepreneur; now that
“domestic system” took its rise which would prevail until late in the
eighteenth century. Nearly every house was a miniature factory, where
women wove and spun flax and wool, sewed and embroidered, prepared herb
medicines, distilled liquor, and almost succeeded in developing an art
of cookery in England.</p>
<p>The Elizabethan state legislated as zealously for the economy as
for</p>
<p>religion. Aware that municipal restrictions on manufacture and trade
were hampering commerce and industry, it replaced communal by na- tional
regulation. The famous Statute of Apprentices (1563) established a
laborious code of governmental supervision and compulsion that re-
mained the law of England till 1815. Proposing to banish idleness and
unemployment, it required every able-bodied youngster to serve as ap-
prentice for seven years, for “until a man grow into twenty -three
years, he for the most part, though not always, is wild, without
judgment, and not of sufficient experience to govern himself.”*^ Every
willfully unemployed man under thirty not having an income of forty
shillings a year could be forced to take employment as directed by the
local authorities. In the countryside all well men under sixty could be
compelled to join in har- vesting. All workmen were to be hired by
yearly contract, at a kind of guaranteed annual wage. The justices of
the peace were empowered to fix maximum and minimum remuneration for
every employment in their territory; for London laborers the pay was
fixed at ninepence a day. Masters unduly dismissing employees were to be
fined forty shillings; men unlawfully quitting their jobs were to be
jailed; and no employee was to leave his town or parish without
permission of his employer and the local magistrate. Hours of work were
defined as twelve per day in summer and through daylight in winter.
Strikes of any kind were for- bidden under penalty of imprisonment or
heavy fines.^</p>
<p>All in all, the statute had the effect of protecting the employer
against the employee, agriculture against industry, and the state
against social revolt. A guild of bricklayers at Hull inscribed at the
head of its ordi- nances the consoling proposition that “all men are by
nature equal, made all by one Workma n of like mire”;® but nobody
believed it, least of all Cecil and Elizabeth; and it was probably Cecil
who directed the economic legislation of 1563. Its results for the
working classes was to make poverty compulsory. It proposed to readjust
wages periodically to the price of basic foods, but the magistrates
commissioned to do this belonged to tlie</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>employing class. Wages rose, but far more slowly than prices; between
1580 and 1640 the price of necessities climbed 100 per cent, wages 20
per cent.® During the century from 1550 to 1650 the conditions of
artisans and laborers worsened from day to day.^ The outskirts of London
“filled up with a comparatively poor and often vicious class, dwelling
in meanest tenements,”® and living in some parts by theft and beggary.
At the funeral of the Earl of Shrewsbury (1591) some twenty thousand
beggars applied for a dole.®</p>
<p>The government attacked these evils with ferocious laws against
mendi- cancy, and a comparatively humane series of Poor Laws (1563-1601)
that acknowledged the responsibility of the state for keeping its people
from starvation. In every parish a tax was collected to care for the
unemploy- able poor and to put the employable to work in workhouses
managed by the state.</p>
<p>The rise of prices proved as stimulating to industry and commerce as
it was tragic to the poor. The main causes were the mining of silver in
Europe, the importation of precious metals from America, and the debase-
ment of currencies by governments. In the period from 1501 to 1544 the
total amount of silver imported or produced in Europe was worth some
50,000,000 in terms of 1957; for the period from 1545 to 1600 it was
worth some 00,000,000.^® Elizabeth struggled nobly against debasement of
the English coinage. She accepted the advice of her canny councilor. Sir
Thomas Gresham, who warned her (1560), in words that became “Gresham’s
law,” that bad money drives out good — that coins with an honest content
of precious metal will be hoarded or sent abroad, while coins without
proper content will be used for all other purposes, especially for
taxes, the state being “paid in its own coin.” Elizabeth and Cecil re-
formed the currency that her father and brother had debased, and
restored the gold or silver content of English coins. Prices rose
nevertheless, for the influx or production of silver and gold, and the
circulation of</p>
<p>currency, outran the production of goods.</p>
<p>Monopolies shared in raising prices. Elizabeth permitted them for the
manufacture or sale of iron, oil, vinegar, coal, lead, saltpeter,
starch, yarns, skins, leather, glass. She granted these patents partly
to encourage capital in importing products and establishing new
industries, partly as remunera- tion for offices and services not
otherwise sufficiently paid. When com- plaints against these monopolies
rose to the pitch of parliamentary revolt, Elizabeth agreed to suspend
them until their operation had been investi- gated and approved (1601).
Some were maintained.</p>
<p>So hampered, domestic trade developed more slowly than foreign com-
merce. Except at fairs, no one was allowed to sell goods in any town of
v/hich he was not a resident. Such fairs were periodical in many
localities.</p>
<p>CHAP, n)</p>
<p>MERRIE ENGLAND</p>

<p>and numbered several hundred a year; the most popular was the Bar-
tholomew Fair, held each August near London, with a circus to draw the
people to the merchandise. Goods moved by water rather than by road; the
rivers were alive with traffic. Roads were bad but improving, and men
could ride a hundred miles on them in a day; the messenger who brought
to Edinburgh the news of Elizabeth’s death traveled 162 miles on his
first day out. Postal service, established in 1517, was for the
government only; private mail went by friends, envoys, couriers, or
other travelers. Land travel was mostly on horseback. Coaches were
introduced about 1 564; they remained till 1600 a luxury of the few; but
by 1634 they were so numerous that a proclamation forbade their use by
private persons because of con- gestion of traffic.’^ Inns were good,
and so were their waitresses, except on demand; but the wayfarer had to
watch his purse and conceal his route.^^ You had to be on your toes in
Elizabeth’s England.</p>
<p>Foreign commerce grew as industry developed. The export of finished
products was the preferred way of paying for the import of raw materials
and Oriental luxuries. The market was expanding from commune to nation
to Europe, even to Asia and America, and the scope and power of national
governments grew with the reach and problems of trade. England, like
Spain and France, wished to export goods and import gold, for the “mer -
cantilist” theory then prevalent measured a nation’s wealth by the
precious metals it held. Francis Bacon was apparently the first to speak
of a favor- able “balance of trade,”^® by which he meant an excess of
exports over imports, and therefore an intake of silver or gold. Cecil
declared his aim “by all policies to abridge the use of foreign
commodities as be not neces - sary for us.”^^ He knew that silver and
gold cannot be eaten or worn, but they were an international currency
that could in an emergency buy al- most anything, even enemies. Home
industries had to be protected in time of peace, lest the nation be
dependent on foreign products in time of war. Hence governments
discouraged imports by tariffs and encouraged exports with subsidies.
“Merchant companies” were formed to sell English prod - ucts abroad;
English “merchant adventurers” developed an export outlet at Hamburg,
Anthony Jenkinson led trade missions to Russia (1557) and Persia (1562),
another went to India (1583-91), an English Turkey Com- pany was set up
in 1581, the Muscovy Company was founded in 1595, and the historic East
India Company on December 31, 1600. The stage was prepared for Hastings
and Clive. Men in love with the sea or money ventured across oceans to
find new trade routes; the science of geography was in part a by-product
of their zeal. A fury of shipbuilding was en- gendered by the quest for
markets and colonies; English forests became masts and hulls, Britannia
began to rule the waves, and the British Empire was bom in fact and
phrase.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>As commerce spread its sails, financial institutions developed to
expedite it. Banks multiplied. In 1553 the Merchant Adventurers
organized a joint- stock company for trade with Russia; 240 shares were
issued, at</p>
<p>each; after each expedition profits were distributed and the invested
capital was refunded.^® The East India Company financed its voyages
likewise; and the 87 V2 per cent profit realized on its first venture
led to a rush of subscribers — courtiers, judges, clergymen, knights,
widows, spinsters, tradesmen — to share in the next enterprise. Aden and
women loved money as passionately then as now. Interest on loans had
been forbidden by Par- liament as late as 1552 as “a vice most odious’
V” but the growing strength of business forces in the Commons led to the
Usury Bill of 1571, which distinguished interest from usury and
legalized a 10 per cent return. As stock transactions mounted, bourses
were formed for the exchange of ownership in shares or goods, and
additional currency was coined to facilitate the sale and purchase of
commodities. In 1566 Gresham built the Royal Exchange to cover such
mercantile and financial operations. In 1583 it issued the earliest life
insurance policy.^^</p>
<p>The commercial spirit grew as London became one of the thriving</p>
<p>marts and centers of the world. The unlit streets were brightened
with goods; a traveler to many countries judged the London goldsmiths’
es - tablishments as the most sumptuous anywhere.^® Businessmen were
cramped for quarters, and some used the nave of St. Paul’s Cathedral as
tem porary offices, confident that Christ had changed His mind since
Calvin; lawyers dealt with clients there, men counted out money on the
tombs, and in the courtyard hucksters sold bread and meat, fish and
fruit, ale and beer. Pedestrians, peddlers, coaches, and carts swarmed
in the narrow and muddy streets. The Thames served as the main
thoroughfare, carrying barges, ferries, and pleasure craft; at almost
any point a waterman could be found with a boat ready to transfer goods
or passengers across the river or upstream or down; hence their lusty
cries, “Eastward Ho!” and “West - ward Ho!” — which gave titles to
Jacobean plays. When its odors abated, the river was a blessing to
commerce, recreation, and amours, the setting for stately pageants and
rich homes. London Bridge, built in 1209, was the pride of the town and
the only road between its north and south sides. The south specialized
in taverns, theaters, brothels, and jails. The north was the chief
center of business; here the merchant was master, the titled lord
entered on sufferance; royalty and nobility lived mostly in palaces
outside London. Westminster, where Parliament met, was then a separate
city. There too the businessman made himself heard; by 1600 he could
frighten the Queen, and a half century later he beheaded the King.</p>

<li>IN THE SCHOOLS</li>
</ol>
<p>The age of Shakespeare was not addicted to education. It had little
Latin and less Greek, more of Italian and French. It read books avidly
but rapidly, rushing to test them with experience. It went to school to
life, and talked back to its teacher with unheard-of insolence.</p>
<p>The language that it used was not that of schools. It was the whole
spoken heritage of Celtic, Roman, Saxon, Norman England; it was swollen
with the linguistic spoils of France and Italy; it snatched up slang
from the London streets,* and dialects from the provinces; and, not
content, it made words breed words and let exuberant imagination riot in
originative speech. Was there ever a language so vivid, powerful,
flexible, and rich? It could not stop to spell consistently; there were,
before 1570, no dictionaries to guide orthography, and Shakespeare never
decided how to spell his name. Shorthand was used, but did not cool the
impatience of bustling business or precipitate poetry.</p>
<p>All organized education of girls had been ended by Henry VIIFs
dissolution of the nunneries; but primary education was offered gratis
to any boy in reach of a town. Elizabeth opened 100 free grammar
schools; James I and Charles I would found 288 more. For lads of
pedigree there were already established “public” schools at Winchester,
Eton, St. Paul’s, and Shrewsbury; now were</p>
<p>Oxford and Cambridge still monopolized university education. They had
fallen, during the turmoil of the Reformation, from their medieval
authority and myriad registrations, but they were recovering, and each
had some 1,500 students in 1586. At Cambridge Sir Walter Mildmay endowed
Emmanuel Col- lege (1584), and Frances, Countess of Sussex and aunt of
Philip Sidney, founded Sidney Sussex College (1588). At Oxford, Jesus
College was set up by gov- ernmental and other funds (1571), and Wadham
(1610) and Pembroke (1624) were added under James I. Cambridge was
thrilled in 1564 by a visit from the Queen. She listened with modest
demurrers to a Latin oration in her praise; at Trinity College she
replied in Greek to a Greek address; on the streets she bandied Latin
with the students; finally she herself made a Latin speech expressing
the hope that she might do something for learning. Two years later she
visited Oxford, gloried in the lovely halls and fields, and, departing,
cried out fervently, “Farewell, my good subjects! farewell, my dear
scholars! and may God prosper your studies!”^® She knew how to be a
queen.</p>
<p>Other Englishwomen rivaled her in erudition. The daughters of Sir
Anthony</p>

<p>Coke were famous for their learning, and Mary Sidney, Countess of
Pembroke, made her mansion at Wilton a salon of poets, statesmen, and
artists, who found in her a mind capable of appreciating their best.
Such women received most of their education from tutors at home. Grammar
schools were open to both sexes, but public schools and universities
were for men only.</p>
<p>It was a sign of the times when Elizabeth’s ablest financier set up
in Lon - don (1579) Gresham College for law, medicine, geometry,
rhetoric, and other studies useful to the business class; he specified
that the lectures were to be given in English as w ell as in Latin,
since “merchants and other citizens” would attend. 2 ® Finally, for the
moneyed or titled class, education was com- pleted by travel. Students
went to Italy to finish their medical and sexual training or make
acquaintance with Italian literature and art, and many learned to like
France on the way. Language was then no barrier, for every educated man
in Western and Central Europe understood Latin. Nevertheless, when the
travelers returned, they brought home some rubbing of Italian and
French, and a special fondness for the easy morals of Renaissance
Italy.</p>

<p>I was once in Italie myself, but I thanke God my abode there was but

libertie</p>
<p>to sinne, than ever I hard tell of in our noble Citie of London in
ix</p>
<p>years.21</p>
<p>Elizabeth’s tutor was not the only one who strummed this tune. “We
have robbed Italy of wantonness,” wrote Stephen Gosson in The Schoole of
Abuse (1579); “compare London to Rome, and England to Italy, you shall
find the theaters of the one, and the abuses of the other, to be rife
among us.” Cecil advised his son Robert never to allow his sons to cross
the Alps, “for they shall learn nothing there but pride, blasphemy, and
atheism.”^^ Philip Stubbs, a Puri tan, in The Anatoime of Abuses (1583),
described the Elizabethan English as wicked, vainly luxurious, and proud
of</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>MERRIE ENGLAND</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>their sins. Bishop Jewel, in a sermon before the Queen, lamented that
men’s morals in London “make a mockery of God’s Holy Gospel, and so
become more dissolute, more fleshly, more wanton than ever they were
before … If our life should give testimony and report to our religion .
. . it crieth out . . . ‘There is no God.’”***</p>
<p>Much of the jeremiads was the exaggeration of moralists fuming
against men and women who no longer took to heart the terrors of hell.
Probably the bulk of the population was no worse or better than before.
But just as the Puritan minority tightened its morals, purses, and lips,
so a pagan minority agreed with many Italians that it was better to
enjoy life than fuss about death. Possibly Italian wines, popular in
England, helped to broaden morals as well as arteries, and more
lastingly. From Italy, France, and classical literature may have come a
franker sense of beauty, though saddened with a keener consciousness of
its brevity. Even the beauty of the youthful male aroused the
Elizabethan soul and pen; Marlowe made Mephistopheles praise Fau st as
fairer than the skies,^^ and Shakespeare’s sonnets fluttered between
homosexual and heterosexual love. Woman’s loveliness was now no mere
poetic conceit, but an intoxication that ran through the blood, the
literature, and the court, and turned pirates into sonneteers. For at
the court women added wit to cosmetics and captured men’s minds as well
as their hearts. Modesty was an invitation to the chase and doubled
beauty’s power. Litanies to the Virgin were lost in depreca - tions of
virginity. Romantic love burst into song with all the ardor of denied
desire. Women gloried in seeing men fight for them, and gave themselves,
in marriage or without, to the victor. It was significant of the decline
in the authority of religion that no church sanction or ceremony was now
required for the validity of marriage, though the admission was
considered an oflFense to public morals as distinct from law. Most
marriages were arranged by the parents after a mutual courtship of
properties; then the dizzy goddess of the hour became a disillusioned
housekeeper, dedi- cated to children and chores, and the race
survived.</p>
<p>A worse laxity of morals marked public life. Graft, petty or
magni-</p>
<p>ficent, ran through the official services; Elizabeth connived at it,
as ex- cusing her from raising salaries.^® The war treasurer made £
16,000 a year besides his pay; by a time-honored swindle the captains
kept dead soldiers</p>
<ul>
<li>Aubrey tells a tale that gives point to Ascham: “Sir Walter Raleigh,
being invited to dinner with some great person . . . His son sat next to
his father, and was very demure at least half dinner time. Then said he:

to them;^® a soldier was worth more dead than alive. Men in high places
took large sums from Philip II to turn English policy to Spanish
ends.<sup>’</sup> Ad- mirals practiced piracy and sold slaves. Clergymen
sold ecclesiastical emoluments.^® Apothecaries could be persuaded to
concoct poisons, and some doctors to administer them.-® Tradesmen
adulterated goods to the point of international scandal; in 1585 “more
false cloth and woolen was ma de in England than in all Europe
besides.”®® Military morals were primitive; unconditional surrender was
in many cases rewarded with massacre of soldiers and noncombatants
alike. Witches were burned, and Jesuits were taken down from the
scaffold to be cut to pieces alive.®^ The milk of human kindness flowed
sluggishly in the days of Good Queen Bess.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>JUSTICE AND THE LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>The nature of man, despite so many centuries of religion and govern-
ment, still resented civilization, and it voiced its protest through a
pro- fusion of sins and crimes. Laws and myths and punishments barely
stemmed the flood. In the heart of London were four law schools, the
Middle</p>
<p>Temple, the Inner Temple, Lincoln’s Inn, and Gray’s Inn,
collectively</p>
<p>known as the Inns of Court. Law students resided there as other
students dwelt in the halls or colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. Only
“gentle - men” of blood were admitted; all graduates were sworn to the
service of the Crown; their leading or easily led lights became judges
in the</p>
<p>Queen’s courts. Judges and lawyers, in action, wore impressive robes;
the majesty of the law was half sartorial.</p>
<p>The courts were by common consent corrupt. One member of Par-</p>
<p>liamen t defined a justice of the peace as “an animal who, for half
-a-dozen chickens, would dispense with a dozen laws”;®® Francis Bacon
required higher inducements. “Plate sin with gold,” said Shakespeare’s
saddened Lear, “and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.”®® As
judges were removed at the Queen’s pleasure, they weighed it in their
judgments, and royal favorites accepted bribes to induce her
interference with decisions of the courts.®^ Jury trial was maintained
except for treason, but the juries were often intimidated by the judges
or other officers of the Crown.®® Treason was loosely defined to include
all actions endangering the life or majesty of the sovereign; such cases
could be summoned before the Star Chamber — the Privy Council in its
judicial capacity; there the de- fendant was denied jury trial, counsel,
and habeas corpus, he was subject to exhausting interrogation or
torture, and he was usually condemned to imprisonment or death.</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>MERRIE ENGLAND</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Criminal law relied on deterrents rather than surveillance or
detection; laws being weak, punishments were severe. Death was the
statutory penalty for any of two hundred offenses, including blackmail,
cutting down young trees, and stealing more than a shilling; in an
average Elizabethan year eight hundred persons were hanged in Merrie
England for crime.®® Minor crimes were punished by the pillory, the
stool, whipping at the cart’s tail, burning a hole in the ears or the
tongue, cutting out the tongue, or cutting off an ear or a hand.®^ When
John Stubbs, a Puritan lawyer, wrote a pamphlet condemning Elizabeth’s
proposed marriage to Alen9on as a surrender to Catholicism, his right
hand was cut off by order of a magis- trate. Holding up the bleeding
stump, and raising his hat with his left hand, Stubbs cried, “Long live
the Queen!”®® Philip Sidney sent Elizabeth a protest against the
barbarity, and Cecil, ashamed, gave Stubbs a govern- ment sinecure.
Torture was illegal, but the Star Chamber used it. We perceive that
despite the profound and powerful literature of the age, its general
level of civilization had not yet reached that of Petrarch’s Italy or
Avignon, much less that of Augustus’ Rome.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>IN THE HOME</li>
</ol>
<p>English life began by risking infantile mortality, which was
high.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was a leading physician, yet six of his ten
children died in childhood.®* Then there were epidemics, like the
“sweating sick - ness” of 1550 and the plague visitations of 1563, 1592
-94, and 1603. Tenure of life must have been low; one calculation places
it at eight and a half years.^® Men matured and grew old faster than
today. Those who survived were the hardy, and their adventures with
death toughened them for strata- gems and spoils.</p>
<p>Sanitation was improving. Soap was graduating from a luxury to a</p>
<p>necessity. About 1596 Sir John Harington invented a flush toilet.
Private bathrooms were few; most families used a wooden tub placed
before an open fire. Many towns had public baths, and Bath and Buxton
provided fashionable bathing establishments for the upper classes. “Hot
houses” offered sweat baths and facilities for meals and assignations.
Only the well-to-do had their own domestic water supply; most families
had to fetch water from public conduits opening at ornamental
spouts.</p>
<p>Houses in villages and towns were built of plaster and brick,
under</p>
<p>roofs thatched with straw; Anne Hathaway’s cottage near Stratford
-on- Avon is a well-restored example. In the cities dwellings usually
adjoined each other, used more brick and stone, and had tiled roofs;
mullioned bay windows and overhanging upper stories make them attractive
to un- familiar eyes. Interiors were decorated with carvings and
pilasters; fire-</p>
<p>THEAGEOFREASONBEGINS (CHAP. II</p>
<p>places gave the main room or “great hall” dignity and warmth; and
ceil - ings — of timber or plaster — might be cut into symmetrical or
fanciful designs. Chimneys took off the smoke that had formerly sought
exit through a hole in the ceiling, and stoves were helping the hearth.
Glass windows were now common, but night lighting was still by torch
or</p>
<p>candle power. Floors were covered with rushes and herbs,
sweet-smelling when fresh, but soon malodorous and sheltering insects;
carpets were forty- five years in the future. Walls were adorned with
tapestries, which, under Charles I, would give way to paintings. Most
people sat on benches or stools; a chair with a back was a luxury
reserved for an honored guest or the master or mistress of the house;
hence to “take the chair” came to mean to preside. Otherwise the
furniture was strong and admirable: buf- fets, cabinets, tables, chests,
four-posters were cut and mortised in walnut or oak to last for
centuries; some beds, with thick mattresses of feather, embroidered
coverings, and silk canopies, cost a thousand pounds and were the
proudest heirloom of the home. Around or behind the house, in nearly all
classes, a garden provided trees, shrubs, shade, and such flowers as
women used to grace their homes and hair, and Shakespeare to scent his
verse — primrose, hyacinth, honeysuckle, larkspur, sweet Wil- liam,
marigold, Cupid’s -flower, love-lies-bleeding, love-in-a-mist, lily of
the valley, roses white or red, L ancaster or York. “God Almighty
first</p>
<p>planted a garden,” said Bacon, “without which buildings and palaces
are but gross handiworks.”*^</p>
<p>Ornamentation of the person was often more costly than decoration of
the home. No age surpassed Elizabethan England in splendor of dress.
“Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,” advised Polonius. In moneyed
ranks all the fashions of France, Italy, and Spain were merged to redeem
the human figure from the depredations of appetite and time. Portia
laughed at young Falconbridge — “I think he bought his doublet in Italy,
his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior every-
where,”*^ Elizabeth set an example and a vogue of finery, so that in her
reign fashions changed repeatedly as common imitation blurred class
distinction. “The fashion,” mourns a character in Much Ado about</p>
<p>Nothing, “wears out more apparel than the man.”<em>’</em> Sumptuary
laws tried to end this sartorial chorea; so a statute of 15 74, to heal
“the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen” who were
wearing their acres on their backs, decreed that none but the royal
family, dukes, mar- quesses, and earls should wear purple, silk, cloth
of gold, or sable furs; none but barons and their betters should sport
furs, crimson or scarlet velvets, imported woolens, gold or silver or
pearl embroidery.** Such laws were soon evaded, for the ambitious
bourgeoisie denounced them as not only invidious but restraining trade,
and in 1604 they were repealed.</p>
<p>CHAP. 11 )</p>
<p>M ERRIE ENGLAND</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Hats were of any shape or color, of velvet, wool, silk or fine hair.
Out- side the home and the court men wore them nearly always, even in
church, doffing them ceremoniously on meeting a lady, but at once
covering again. Men wore their hair as long as the women, and grew fancy
beards. Around the neck both sexes wore a ruff, a collar of linen and
cambric built upon a frame of pasteboard and wire, and stiffened into
broad sharp pleats by “a certain liquid matter which they call
starch,”^® which was then making its debut in England. Catherine de
Medicis had introduced this noose into France (1533) as a small frill,
but fashion expanded it into a pillory reach- ing to the ears.</p>
<p>Clothing made women a temporarily impenetrable mystery. Half their
day must have been taken up with taking on and taking off; “a ship is
sooner rigged than a woman.”^® Even hair could be p ut off or on, for
Elizabeth gave the example of wearing a wig, dyed to resemble the golden
curls of her youth. False hair was common; poor women, said Shakespeare,
sold their locks “by the weight.”^^ Instead of hats most women
preferred</p>
<p>delicate material and elaborate design covered the legs. Silk
stockings were introduced by the Queen. Skirts trailed, sleeves bulged,
gloves were em- broidered and perfumed. In summer a lady could speak
with a jeweled fan, and utter thoughts too kind for words.</p>
<p>But life in the home was seldom in full dress. Breakfast at seven,
dinner at eleven or twelve, supper at five or six redeemed the day. The
main meal was near noon and plentiful. “The English,” said a Frenchman,
“stuff their sacks.”^® Fingers still served in pla ce of forks, which
came into their present use in the reign of James I. Silver plate
adorned prosperous homes; the hoarding of it was already a hedge against
inflation. The lower middle classes had vessels of pewter; the poor got
along with dishes of wood and spoons of horn. Meat, fish, and bread were
the staple foods, and nearly everybody who could afford it suffered from
gout. Dairy products were popular only in the countryside, for means of
refrigeration were still scant in the towns. Vegetables were widely used
only by the poor, who grew them in their garden plots. Potatoes,
introduced from America by Raleigh’s expeditions, were a garden product,
not yet a crop in the fields. Puddings were an English specialty,
relished beyond dessert. Sweets were as favored as now; hence
Elizabeth’s black teeth.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>These hearty meals required liquid lubricants — ale, cider, beer, and
wine. Tea and coffee were not yet Anglicized. Whiskey* came into general
use throughout Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, being
dis- tilled from grain in the north, from wine in the south. Drunkenness
was a protest against the damp climate; the phr ase “drunk as a lord”
suggests that this remedy rose in favor along the social scale. Tobacco
was brought into England by Sir John Hawkins (1565), by Drake, and by
Sir Ralph</p>
<p>Lane; Raleigh made smoking of it fashionable at court, and took a
puff or two before he went to the scaffold. In Elizabeth’s time it was
too costly for its use to be widespread; at social gatherings a pipe
might be passed around to let each guest get his quota. In 1604 King
James sent forth a mighty Counterblast to Tobacco^ lamenting its
introduction into England and warning against “a certain venomous
quality” in it.</p>
<p>Is it not both great vanity and uncleanness that at the table, a
place of respect, of cleanliness, of modesty, men should not be ashamed
to sit tossing of Tobacco pipes, and puffing the smoke one to
another,</p>
<p>making the filthy smoke and stink thereof to exhale athwart the
dishes and infect the air? . . . The public use whereof, at all times
and in all places, hath now so far prevailed as divers men . . . have
been at least forced to take it also, without desire . . . ashamed to
seem singular . . . Moreover, which is a great iniquity . . . the
husband shall not be</p>
<p>ashamed to reduce thereby his delicate, wholesome, and clean com-
plexioned wife to that extremity, that either she must also corrupt her
sweet breath therewith, or else resolute to live in a perpetual stinking
torment … A custom loathesome to the eye, hateful to the nose,</p>
<p>harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and, in the black
stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of
the pit that is bottomless.®®</p>
<p>Despite this and heavy taxes, there were seven thousand tobacco shops
in London. Lighting and puffing did not take the place of conversation.
Both sexes spoke freely of matters now confined to smoking rooms, street
corners, and scientists; and women vied with men in oaths that verged on
blasphemy. In the Elizabethan drama whores rub elbows with heroes, and
doubles-entendres sprinkle high tragedy. Manners were ceremonious rather
than polite; words often graduated into blows. Manners, like morals,
came from Italy and France, and also manuals of courtesy that strove to
make gentlemen of aristocrats and ladies of queens. Modes of salutation
were effusive, often osculatory. Homes were more cheerful with light and
jollity than before under medieval terror or afterward under Puritan
gloom. Festivals were frequent; any excuse served for a procession or
parade; wed-</p>

<p>dings, lyings-in, even funerals, gave occasion for festivities, at
least for meals. Games of all sorts were played in homes and fields and
on the Thames. Shakespeare mentions billiards, and Florio speaks of
cricket. Blue laws and blue Sundays were laughed at; if the Queen set
the merry pace, why should not her people keep step with her? Nearly
everybody danced, including, said Burton, “old men and women that have
more toes than teeth.” And all England sang.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ENGLISH music; I558-1649</li>
</ol>
<p>No one who knows only post-Puritan England can feel the joyous role
of music in Elizabethan days. From the home, the school, the church, the
street, the stage, the Thames, rose sacred or profane song — masses,
motets, madrigals, ballads, and delicate little lyrics of love such as
those that found a setting in Elizabethan plays. Music was a main course
in education; at Westminster School it received two hours a week; Oxford
had a chair of music (1627). Every gentleman was expected to read music
and play some instrument. In Thomas Motley’s Plaine and Easie
Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) an imaginary untutored
Englishman confesses this shame:</p>
<p>Supper being ended, and musicke bookes, according to the custome,
being brought to the table, the mistresse of the house presented me with
a part, earnestly requesting me to sing; but when, after many ex- cuses,
I protested unfeignedly that I could not, everyone began to</p>
<p>wonder, some whispering to others, demanding how I was brought
up.®^</p>
<p>Barbershops provided instruments for waiting customers to play.</p>
<p>Elizabethan music was predominantly secular. Some composers, like
Tallis, Byrd, and Bull, remained Catholic despite the laws and wrote for
the Roman ritual, but such compositions were not publicly performed.
Many Puritans objected to church music as diverting piety; Elizabeth and
the bishops saved church music in England, as Palestrina and the Council
of Trent rescued it in Italy. The Queen supported with her wonted
determi- nation the chapelmasters who organized large choirs and formal
music for the royal chapel and the cathedrals. The Book of Common Prayer
became a magnificent libretto for English composers, and the Anglican
services almost rivaled the Continental Catholic in polyphonic splendor
and dignity. Even the Puritans, following Calvin’s lead, approved psalm
singing by the congregations; Elizabeth laughed at these “Geneva jigs,”
but they matured into some noble hymns.</p>
<p>Since the Queen was a profanely secular spirit and loved to be
courted.</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>it was fitting that the musical glory of her reign should be the
madrigal — love in counterpoint, a part song unaccompanied by
instruments. Italian madrigals reached England in 1553 and set the key.
Morley tried his hand at the form, expounded it in his graceful
dialogue, and invited imitation. A madrigal for five voices, by John
Wilbye, suggests the themes of these</p>
<p>Alas, what a wretched life this is, what a death.</p>
<p>Where the tyrant love commandeth!</p>
<p>My flowering days are in their prime declining.</p>
<p>All my proud hope quite fallen, and life entwining;</p>
<p>My joys each after other in haste are flying</p>
<p>And leave me dying</p>
<p>For her that scorns my crying;</p>
<p>Oh, she from here departs, my Love restraining.</p>
<p>For whom, all heartless, alas, I die complaining.®*</p>
<p>William Byrd was the Shakespeare of Elizabethan music, famous for
masses and madrigals, for vocal and instrumental compositions alike. His
contemporaries honored him as homo memorabilis-, Morley said he was
“never without reverence to be named among the musicians.”®® Almost as
highly rated and versatile were Orlando Gibbons and John Bull, royal-
chapel organists. These and Byrd joined (1611) in producing the initial
book of keyboard music in England, Parthenia, or The Maydenhead of the
first musicke that ever was printed for the Virginalls. Meanwhile the
English sustained their reputation for composing solo songs of a
wholesome freshness redolent of the English countryside. John Dowland,
renowned as a virtuoso of the lute, won praise for his Songes or Ayres,
and Thomas Campion gave him close rivalry. Who does not know Campion’s
“Cherry Ripe”.?®^</p>
<p>Musicians were organized in a strong union, disturbed under Charles I
by internal strife.®® Instruments were nearly as various as today: lute,
harp, organ, virginal or spinet, clavichord or harpsichord, flute,
recorder (our flageolet), hautboy, comet, trombone, trumpet, drums, and
many forms of viol, which was now giving place to the violin. The lute
was favored for virtuoso performance and to accompany songs; the
virginal, modest mother of the piano, was popular with young women, at
least before marriage. Instrumental music was intended chiefly for the
virginal, the viol, and the lute. A kind of chamber music was composed
for an ensemble or “consort” of viols varying in size and range.
Campion, in a masque for James I’s Queen Anne, used an orchestra of
lutes, harpsichords, cornets, and nine viols (1605). Much instrumental
music by Byrd, Morley, Dow- land, and others has come down to us. It is
largely based on dance forms.</p>

<p>follows Italian models, and excels in a delicate and tender beauty
rather than in vigor or range. Fugue and counterpoint are developed, but
no thematic variation, no ingenuity in modulation, no resolved discords
or chromatic harmonies. And yet when our nerves are frayed with the
pound- ing stimuli of modern life, we find something cleansing and
healing in Elizabethan music; no bombast, no rasping dissonances, no
thundering finales, only the voice of an English youth or girl singing
plaintively or merrily the timeless canticles of impeded love.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ENGLISH ART: 1 558- 1 649</li>
</ol>
<p>The Elizabethan was a minor age in art. Metalworkers turned out some
lovely silverware, like the Mostyn salt cellar, and majestic grilles
like that in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor. The making of Venetian
glass was domiciled in England about 1560; vessels of such glass were by
many valued above cor- responding pieces in silver or gold. Sculpture
and pottery were undistinguished. Nicholas Hilliard developed a school
of miniature painting, and Elizabeth granted him a monopoly in so
reproducing her features. Portrait painters were importees: Federigo
Zuccaro from Italy, A^arcus Gheeraerts and his son of the same name from
the Netherlands. The son has left us an imposing portrait of William
Cecil in resplendent, voluminous robes as a Knight of the Garter.^®
Otherwise there was no great painting in England between Holbein and
Vandyck.</p>
<p>Only architecture was a major art in the England of Elizabeth and
James, and it was almost entirely secular. While Europe was fighting the
battle of the faiths, art, like conduct, neglected religion. In medieval
centuries, when the profoundest poetry and art had their roots in the
sky, architecture dedicated itself to church building, and made homes a
form of life imprisonrnent. In Tudor England religion departed from life
into politics; the wealth of the Church passed into lay hands and was
transformed into civic structures and lordly palaces. Style changed
accordingly. In 1563 John Shute returned from Italy and France bursting
with Vitruvius, Palladio, and Serlio; soon he published The First and
Chief Grounds of Architecture ^ lauding the classic styles; so the
Italian scorn of Gothic entered England, and Gothic verticals fought for
air amid the encompassing horizontals of the Renaissance. In civic
architecture the age could boast some handsome achievements: the gate of
honor of Caius College and the quadrangle of Clare College at Cam-
bridge, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the Royal Exchange in London,
and the Middle Temple. As lawyers, since Wolsey, had replaced bishops in
the administration of England, it was fitting that the civic masterpiece
of Eliza- bethan Renaissance architecture should be the great hall of a
law school, finished in the Middle Temple in 1572. No woodwork in
England was finer than the oak screen at the inner end of that hall. It
was demolished by bombs in the Second World War,</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap, it</p>
<p>When Elizabethan magnates could afford it they built palaces rivaling
the chateaux of the Loire. Sir John Thynne raised Longleat House;
Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, had her Hardwick Hall; Thomas, Earl
of Suffolk, built Audley End at a cost of 190,000, “mainly procured from
Spanish bribes”;®*^ Sir Edward Phillips reared Montacute House in chaste
Renaissance style; and Sir Francis Willoughby erected Wollaton Hall.
William Cecil poured part of his gleanings into an immense chateau near
Stamford; and his son Robert spent almost as much on Hatfield House,
whose long gallery is one of the grandest interiors in all the
architecture of the age. Such long galleries, on an upper floor,
replaced in Elizabethan palaces the timbered great hall of the manor
house. Magnificent chimney pieces, massive furniture in walnut or oak,
majestic stairways, carved balustrades, and timbered ceilings gave these
palatial chambers a warmth and dignity missing in the more brilliant
rooms of the French chateaux. So far as we know, the designers of these
palaces were the first to receive the title of architect. The epitaph of
Robert Smythl- son, creator of Wollaton Hall, called him “architector,”
i.e., master builder; now at last the great profession found its modern
name.</p>
<p>Now, too, English art became personal, and a man stamped his work
with his character and his will. Born in Smithfield in 1573, Inigo Jones
showed in youth such a flair for design that an earl sent him to Italy
(1600) to study Renaissance architecture. Back in England (1605), he
prepared the scenery of many masques for James I and his Danish Queen.
He visited Italy again (1612-14) returned an enthusiast for the classic
architectural principles that he had studied in the English translation
(1567?) of Vitruvius, and which he found illustrated in the buildings of
Palladio, Peruzzi, Sanmicheli, and San- sovino in Venice and Vicenza. He
rejected the anomalous mixtures of German, Flemish, French, and Italian
forms that had predominated in Elizabethan archi- tecture; he proposed a
pure classic style, in which the Doric, Ionic, and Corin- thian orders
would be kept apart or combined in a congenial sequence and unity.</p>
<p>In 1615 he was put in charge of all royal construction as surveyor
general of the works. When the banqueting hall in the palace of
Whitehall was burned down (1619), Jones was commissioned to build a new
hall for the King. He planned an immense congeries of structures — all
in all, 1,152 feet by 874 — which, if completed, would have given the
British ruler a vaster home than the Louvre, the Tuileries, the
Escorial, or Versailles. But James preferred drinking for the day to
building for centuries; he confined his outlay to the new ban- queting
hall, which, deprived of its intended setting, presented an
unprepossess- ing fagade of classical and Renaissance lines. When
Archbishop Laud asked James to repair the old Cathedral of St. Paul the
architect committed the crime of encasing the Gothic nave in a
Renaissance exterior. Fortunately this structure was des troyed in the
Great Fire of 1666. Jones’s Palladian fronts gradually replaced the
Tudor style, and it dominated England till the middle of the eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>Jones not only served as chief architect for Charles I, but learned
to love rliat luckless gentleman so visibly that when the Civil War
broke out he buried</p>

<p>his savings in the Lambeth marshes and fled to Hampshire (1643).
Cromwell’s soldiers captured him there, but gave him his life for
1,045.^® During this absence from London he designed a country house in
Wiltshire for the Earl of Pembroke. The fagade was simple Renaissance,
but the interior was a model of grandeur and elegance; the “double -
cube” hall, sixty by thirty by thirty feet, has been judged the most
beautiful room in England.^^ As royal armies consumed aristocratic
wealth, Jones lost patronage as well as popularity; he retired into
obscurity and died in poverty (1651). Art slept while war remade the
government of England.</p>

<li>ELIZABETHAN MAN</li>
</ol>
<p>How can we understand the Elizabethan Englishman from the sup-</p>
<p>posedly staid and silent Briton of our youth? Can it be that national
charac- ter is a function of place and time and change? Puritanism and
Methodism intervened between the two ages and types; centuries of Eton,
Harrow, and Rugby; and reckless conquerors quiet down when they sit
supreme.</p>
<p>All in all, the Elizabethan Englishman was a scion of the
Renaissance. In Germany the Reformation overwhelmed the Renaissance; in
France the Renaissance rejected the Reformation; in England the two
movements merged. Under Elizabeth the Reformation triumphed; in
Elizabeth, the Renaissance. There were some stolid — not speechless —
Puritans there, but they did not set the key. The dominant man of the
age was a charge of energy released from old dogmas and inhibitions and
not yet bound to new; boundless in ambition, longing to develop his
capacities, unshackled in humor, sensitive to literature if it breathed
life, given to violence of action and speech, but struggling, amid his
bombast, vices, and cruelties, to be a gentleman. His ideal hovered
between the amiable courtesies of Castiglione’s Courtier and the
ruthless immoralism of Machiavelli’s Prince, He admired Sidney, but he
aspired to be Drake.</p>
<p>Meanwhile philosophy made its way through the cracks of crumbling
faith, and the best minds of the age were the most disturbed. There were
orthodox and conservative souls, timid and gentle souls, amid this un-
dammed flux; there were good men like Roger Ascham, desperately preach-
ing the virtues that had served the past. But their students were in a
venturesome mood. Hear Gabriel Harvey on Cambridge:</p>
<p>The Gospel taught, not learned; Christian Key cold; nothing good</p>
<p>but by imputation; tl’ie ceremonial law, in word abrogated; the
judicial in effect disannulled; the moral indeed abandoned . . . All
inquisitive after news, new books, new fashions, new laws . . . some
after new</p>
<p>heavens, and hells too . . . Every day fresh span new opinions:
heresy</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>in divinity, in philosophy, in humanity, in manners . . . The Devil
not</p>
<p>so hated as the pope.®®</p>
<p>Copernicus had upset the world and sent the earth whirling
dizzily</p>
<p>through space. Giordano Bruno came to Oxford in 1583 and talked of
the new astronomy and infinite worlds, the sun dying of its own heat,
the planets decaying into atomic mist. Poets like John Donne felt the
earth slipping beneath their feet.</p>
<p>In 1595 Florio began to publish his translation of Montaigne; after
that nothing was certain, and doubt was the air men breathed; as Marlowe
is Machiavelli, so Shakespeare is Montaigne. While wise men doubted,
young men schemed. If heaven seemed lost in a philosophic cloud, youth
could resolve to suck this life dry and sample all truth however lethal,
all beauty however fleeting, all power however poisonous. So Marlowe
conceived his Faust and Tamburlaine.</p>
<p>It was this plowing up of old ideas, this liberation of the mind for
the impassioned utterance of new hopes and dreams, that made Elizabethan
England memorable. What would we have cared for its political rivalries,
its religious disputes, its martial triumphs, its thirst for gold, if
its litera- ture, confined to these passing things, had not voiced the
longings, hesita- tions, and resolves of thoughtful souls in every age?
All the influences of that exciting time came to the Elizabethan
ecstasy: the voyages of con- quest and discovery that expanded the
globe, the market, and the mind; the wealth of the middle classes
enlarging the scope and goals of enterprise; the revelation of pagan
literature and art; the upheaval of the Reformation; the rejection of
papal influence in England; the theological debates that unwittingly led
men from dogma to reason; education and the widening audience for books
and plays; the long and profitable peace, and then the arousing
challenge and exhilarating victory over Spain; the great crescendo of
confidence in human power and thought: all these were the stimuli that
prodded England into greatness, these the germs that made her big with
Shakespeare. Now, after almost two silent centuries since Chaucer, she
burst into a passion of prose and poetry, drama and philosophy, and
spoke out bravely to the world.</p>
