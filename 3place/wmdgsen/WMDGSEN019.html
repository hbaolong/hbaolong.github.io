<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>The Paradise of the Gods</p>
<p>I N no other country is religion so powerful, or so important, as in
India.</p>
<p>If the Hindus have permitted alien governments to be set over them
again and again it is partly because they did not care much who ruled or
exploited them — natives or foreigners; the crucial matter was religion,
not politics; the soul, not the body; endless later lives rather than
this passing one. When Ashoka became a saint, and Akbar almost adopted
Hinduism, the power of religion was revealed over even the strongest
men. In our century it is a saint, rather than a statesman, who for the
first time in history has unified all India.</p>
<p>I. THE LATER HISTORY OF BUDDHISM</p>
<p>The Zenith of Buddhism — The Two Vehicles — “Mahay ana”—</p>
<p>Buddhism, Stoicism and Christianity — The decay of Bud-</p>
<p>dhism — Its migrations: Ceylon, Burma, Turkestan, Tibet,</p>
<p>Cambodia, China, Japan</p>
<p>Two hundred years after Ashoka’s death Buddhism reached the peak of
its curve in India. The period of Buddhist growth- from Ashoka to Harsha
was in many ways the climax of Indian religion, education and art. But
the Buddhism that prevailed was not that of Buddha; we might better
describe it as that of his rebellious disciple Subhadda, who, on hear-
ing of the Master’s death, said to the monks: “Enough, sirs! Weep not,
neither lament! We are well rid of the great Samana. We used to be
annoyed by being told, ‘This beseems you, this beseems you not.’ But now
we shall be able to do whatever we like; and what we do not like, that
we shall not have to do!” 1</p>
<p>The first thing they did with their freedom was to split into
sects.</p>
<p>Within two centuries of Buddha’s death eighteen varieties of
Buddhistic doctrine had divided the Master’s heritage. The Buddhists of
south India and Ceylon held fast for a time to the simpler and purer
creed of the Founder, which came to be called Hinayana, or the “Lesser
Vehicle”:.</p>
<p>503</p>
<p>J04 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIH</p>
<p>they worshiped Buddha as a great teacher, but not as a god, and their
Scriptures were the Pah texts of the more ancient faith. But throughout
northern India, Tibet, Mongolia, China and Japan the Buddhism that
prevailed was the Mahay ana, or the “Greater Vehicle,” defined and propa
- gated by Kanishka’s Council; these (politically) inspired
theologians</p>
<p>announced the divinity of Buddha, surrounded him with angels and</p>
<p>saints, adopted the Yoga asceticism of Patanjali, and issued in
Sanskrit a new set of Holy Writ which, though it lent itself readily to
metaphysical and scholastic refinements, proclaimed and certified a more
popular re- ligion than the austere pessimism of Shakya-muni.</p>
<p>The Mahay ana was Buddhism softened with Brahmanical deities, prac-
tices and myths, and adapted to the needs of the Kushan Tatars and the
Mongols of Tibet, over whom Kanishka had extended his rule. A heaven was
conceived in which there were many Buddhas, of whom Amida Buddha, the
Redeemer, came to be the best beloved by the</p>
<p>people; this heaven and a corresponding hell were to be the reward or
punishment of good or evil done on earth, and would thereby liberate
some of the King’s militia for other services. The greatest of the
saints, in this new theology, were the Bodhisattwas, or future Buddhas,
who voluntarily refrained from achieving the Nirvana (here freedom from
rebirth) that was within their merit and power, in order to be reborn
into life after life, and to help others on earth to find the Way. # As
in Mediterranean Christianity, these saints became so popular that they
almost crowded out the head of the pantheon in worship and art. The
veneration of relics, the use of holy water, candles, incense, the
rosary, clerical vestments, a liturgical dead language, monks and nuns,
monastic tonsure and celibacy, confession, fast days, the canonization
of saints, purgatory and masses for the dead flourished in Buddhism as
in medieval Christianity, and seem to have appeared in Buddhism first, t
Mahay ana became to Hinayana or primitive Buddhism what Catholicism was
to Stoicism and primitive Christianity. Buddha, like Luther, had
made</p>
<p>•In one of the Puranas there is a typical legend of the king who,
though deserving heaven, stays in hell to comfort the sufferers, and
will not leave it until all the damned are released.“</p>
<p>t“The Buddhists,” says Fergusson, “kept five cent uries in advance of
the Roman Church in the invention and use of all the ceremonies and
forms common to both re- ligions .” 8 Edmunds has shown in detail the
astonishing parallelism between the Buddhist and the Christian gospels.*
However, our knowledge of the beginnings of these cus- toms and beliefs
is too vague to warrant positive conclusions as to priority.</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 505</p>
<p>the mistake of supposing that the drama of religious ritual could
be</p>
<p>replaced with sermons and morality; and the victory of a Buddhism
rich in myths, miracles, ceremonies and intermediating saints
corresponds to the ancient and current triumph of a colorful and
dramatic Catholicism over the austere simplicity of early Christianity
and modem Protestantism.</p>
<p>That same popular preference for polytheism, miracles and myths</p>
<p>which destroyed Buddha’s Buddhism finally destroyed, in India,
the</p>
<p>Buddhism of the Greater Vehicle itself. For — to speak with the
hindsight wisdom of the historian — if Buddhism was to take over so much
of Hin- duism, so many of its legends, its rites and its gods, soon very
little would remain to distinguish the two religions; and the one with
the deeper roots, the more popular appeal, and the richer economic
resources and political support would gradually absorb the other.
Rapidly superstition, which seems to be the very lifeblood of our race,
poured over from the older faith to the younger one, until even the
phallic enthusiasms of the Shakti sects found place in the ritual of
Buddhism. Slowly the patient and tenacious Brahmans recaptured influence
and imperial patronage; and the success of the youthful philosopher
Shankara in restoring the authority of the Vedas as the basis of Hindu
thought put an end to the intellectual leadership of the Buddhists in
India.</p>
<p>The final blow came from without, and was in a sense invited by</p>
<p>Buddhism itself. The prestige of the Sangha, or Buddhist Order, had,
after Ashoka, drawn the best blood of Magadha into a celibate and
pacific cl ergy; even in Buddha’s time some patriots had complained that
“the monk Gautama causes fathers to beget no sons, and families to
become extinct.” 6 The growth of Buddhism and monasticism in the first
year</p>
<p>Hinduism that had begotten them; the ancient orthodoxy received the
penitent heresy, and “Brahmanism killed Buddhism by a fraternal em - br
ace.” 6 Brahmanism had always been tolerant; in all the history of the
rise and fall of Buddhism and a hundred other sects we find much dis-
putation, but no instance of persecution. On the contrary Brahmanism
eased the return of the prodigal by proclaiming Buddha a god (as an</p>
<p>50 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>avatar of Vishnu), ending animal sacrifice, and accepting into
orthodox practice the Buddhist doctrine of the sanctity of all animal
life. Quietly and peacefully, after half a thousand years of gradual
decay, Buddhism disappeared from India.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was winning nearly all the remainder of the Asiatic
world. Its ideas, its literature and its art spread to Ceylon and the
Malay Peninsula in the south, to Tibet and Turkestan in the north, to
Burma, Siam, Cam- bodia, China, Korea and Japan in the east; in this way
all of these regions except the Far East received as much civilization
as they could digest, precisely as western Europe and Russia received
civilization from Roman and Byzantine monks in the Middle Ages. The
cultural zenith of most of these nations came from the stimulus of
Buddhism. From the time of Ashoka to its decay in the ninth century,
Anuradhapura, in Ceylon, was one of the major cities of the Oriental
world; the Bo-tree there has been worshiped for two thousand years, and
the temple on the heights of Kandy is one of the Meccas of the
150,000,000 Buddhists of Asia.f The Buddhism of Burma is probably the
purest now extant, and its monks often approach the ideal of Buddha;
under their ministrations the 13,000,000 in- habitants of Burma have
reached a standard of living considerably higher than that of India. 7
Sven Hedin v Aurel Stein and Pelliot have unearthed from the sands of
Turkestan hundreds of Buddhist manuscripts, and other evidences of a
culture which flourished there from the time of Kanishka to the
thirteenth century a.d. In the seventh century of our era the enlight-
ened warrior, Srong-tsan Gampo, established an able government in Tibet,
annexed Nepal, built Lhasa as his capital, and made it rich as a halfway
house in Chinese-Indian trade. Having invited Buddhist monks to come
from India and spread Buddhism and education among his people, he
retired from rule for four years in order to learn how to read and
write, and in- augurated the Golden Age of Tibet. Thousands of
monasteries were built in the mountains and on the great plateau; and a
voluminous Tibetan canon of Buddhist books was published, in three
hundred and thirty-three volumes, which preserved for modern scholarship
many works whose Hindu originals</p>
<ul>
<li>Today there are in India proper only 3,000,000 Buddhists — one per
cent of the popu- lation.</li>
</ul>
<p>t The temple at Kandy contains the famous “eye - tooth of Buddha”—
two inches long and an inch in diameter. It is enclosed in a jeweled
casket, carefully guarded from the eyes of the people, and carried
periodically in a solemn procession which draws Buddhists from every
corner of the Orient. On the walls of the temple, frescoes show the
gentle Buddha killing sinners in hell. The lives of great men all remind
us how helplessly they may be transmogrified after their death.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 507</p>
<p>have long been lost . 8 Here, eremitically sealed from the rest of
the world. Buddhism developed into a maze of superstitions, monasticism
and ecclesi- asticism rivaled only by early medieval Europe; and the
Dalai Lama (or “All - Embracing Priest”), hidden away in the great
Potala monastery that</p>

<li>THE NEW DIVINITIES</li>
</ol>
<p>Hinduism — Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva — Krishna — Kali — Animal gods</p>
<p>— The sacred cow — Polytheism and monotheism</p>
<p>The “Hinduism” that now replaced Buddhism was not one religion,</p>
<p>nor was it only religion; it was a medley of faiths and ceremonies
whose practitioners had only four qualities in common: they recognized
the caste system and the leadership of the Brahmans, they reverenced the
cow as especially representative of divinity, they accepted the law of
Karma and the transmigration of souls, and they replaced with new gods
the deities of the Vedas. These faiths had in part antedated and
survived Vedic nature worship; in part they had grown from the
connivance of the Brahmans at rites, divinities and beliefs unknown to
the Scriptures and largely contrary to the Vedic spirit; they had boiled
in the cauldron of Hindu religious thought even while Buddhism
maintained a passing intellectual ascendancy.</p>
<p>The gods of Hinduism were characterized by a kind of anatomical</p>
<p>superabundance vaguely symbolizing extraordinary knowledge, activity
or power. The new Brahma had four faces, Kartikeya six; Shiva had</p>
<p>three eyes, Indra a thousand; and nearly every deity had four arms.“
At the head of this revised pantheon was Brahma, chivalrously neuter,
acknowledged master of the gods, but no more noticed in actual worship
than a constitutional monarch in modern Europe. Combined with him and
Shiva in a triad — not a trinity — of dominant deities was Vishnu, a god
of love who repeatedly became man in order to help mankind. His greatest
incarnation was Krishna; as such he was born in a prison, had
accomplished many marvels of heroism and romance, healed the deaf and
the blind, helped lepers, championed the poor, and raised men from</p>
<p>508 tee story of civilization (chap. XVIII</p>
<p>the grave. He had a beloved disciple, Arjuna, before whom he was
trans- figured. He died, some say, by an arrow; others say by a
crucifixion on a tree. He descended into hell, rose to heaven, and will
return on the last day to judge the quick and the dead. u</p>
<p>To the Hindu there are three chief processes in life and the
universe: creation, preservation and destruction. Hence divinity takes
for him three main forms: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and
Shiva the Destroyer; these are the Trimurti, or “Three Shapes,” which
all Hindus but the Jains adore.* Popular devotion is divided between
Vaishnavism, the religion of Vishnu, and Shivaism, the religion of
Shiva. The two</p>
<p>cults are peaceful neighbors, and sometimes hold sacrifices in the
same temple;“ and the wise Brahmans, followed by a majo rity of the
people, pay equal honor to both these gods. Pious Vaishnavites paint
upon their foreheads every morning with red clay the trident sign of
Vishnu; pious Shivaites trace horizontal lines across their brows with
cow-dung ashes, or wear the linga — symbol of the male organ — fastened
on their arms or hung from their necks . 14</p>
<p>The worship of Shiva is one of the oldest, most profound and most</p>
<p>terrible elements in Hinduism. Sir John Marshall reports
“unmistakable evidence” of the cult of Shiva at Mohenjo-daro, partly in
the form of a three-headed Shiva, partly in the form of little stone
columns which he presumes to be as phallic as their modern counterparts.
“Shivaism,” he concludes, “is therefore the most ancient living faith in
the world.”f“ The name of the god is a euphemism; literally it means
“propitious”; whereas Shiva himself is viewed chiefly as a god of
cruelty and destruc- tion, the personification of that cosmic force
which destroys, one after another, all the forms that reality takes —
all cells, all organisms, all species, all ideas, all works, all planets
and all things. Never has another people dared to face the impermanence
of forms, and the impartiality of nature, so frankly, or to recognize so
clearly that evil balances good, that destruc- tion goes step by step
with creation, and that all birth is a capital crime, punishable with
death. The Hindu, tortured with a thousand misfortunes and sufferings,
sees in them the handiwork of a vivacious force that</p>
<ul>
<li>In the census of 1921 the religions of India divided the population
as follows: Hindu- ism, 216,261,000; Sikhs, 3,239,000; Jains, 1,178,000;
Buddhists, 11,571,000 (nearly all in Burma and Ceylon); Zoroastrians
(Parsees), 102,000; Moslems, 68,735,000; Jews, 22,000; Christians,
4,754,000 (chiefly Europeans). 13</li>
</ul>
<p>f Nevertheless the name of Shiva, like that of Brahman itself, cannot
be found in the Rig-vedz. Patanjali the grammarian mentions Shiva images
and devotees ca. 150 b.c . 10</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 509</p>
<p>appears to find pleasure in breaking down everything that Brahma —
the creative power in nature — has produced. Shiva dances to the tune of
a perpetually forming, dissolving and re-forming world.</p>
<p>Just as death is the penalty of birth, so birth is the frustration of
death; and the same god who symbolizes destruction represents also, for
the Hindu mind, that passion and torrent of reproduction which overrides
the death of the individual with the continuance of the race. In some
parts of India, particularly Bengal, this creative or reproductive
energy (Shakti) of Shiva or nature is personified in the figure of
Shiva’s wife, Kali (Parvati, Uma, Durga), and is worshiped in one of the
many Shakti cults. Until the last century this worship was a bloody
ritual, often in- volving human sacrifice; latterly the goddess has been
content with goats.” The deity is portrayed for the populace by a black
figure with gaping mouth and protruding tongue, adorned with snakes and
dancing upon a corpse; her earrings are dead men, her necklace is a
string of skulls, her face and breasts are smeared with blood . 18 Two
of her four hands carry a sword and a severed head; the other two are
extended in blessing and protection. For Kali-Parvati is the goddess of
motherhood as well as the bride of destruction and death; she can be
tender as well as cruel, and can smile as well as kill; once, perhaps,
she was a mother- goddess in Sumeria, and was imported into India before
she became so terrible.” Doubtles s she and her lord are made as
horrible as possible in order that timid worshipers may be frightened
into decency, and perhaps into generosity to the priests.*</p>
<p>These are the greater gods of Hinduism; but they are merely five
of</p>
<p>thirty million deities in the Hindu pantheon; only to catalogue them
would take a hundred volumes. Some of them are more properly angels,
some are what we should call devils, some are heavenly bodies like the
sun, some are mascots like Lakshmi (goddess of good luck), many of them
are beasts of the field or fowl of the air. To the Hindu mind there was
no real gap between animals and men; animals as well as men had souls,
and souls were perpetually passing from men into animals, and back
again; all these species were woven into one infinite web of Karma and
reincar- nation. The elephant, for example, became the god Ganesha, and
was recognized as Shiva’s son ; 21 he personified man’s animal nature,
and at the same time his image served as a charm against evil fortune.

<li>The priests of Shivaism, however, are seldom Brahmans; and the
majority of the Brahmans look with scorn and regret upon the Shakti cult
. 20</li>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>and snakes were terrible, and therefore divine. The cobra or naga,
whose bite causes almost immediate death, received especial veneration;
annually the people of many parts of India celebrated a religious feast
in honor of snakes, and made offerings of milk and plantains to the
cobras at the entrance to their holes . 53 Temples have been erected in
honor of snakes, as in eastern Mysore; great numbers of reptiles take up
their residence in these buildings, and are fed and cared for by the
priests . 33 Crocodiles, tigers, peacocks, parrots, even rats, receive
their meed of worship . 31</p>
<p>Most sacred of all animals to a Hindu is the cow. Images of bulls,
in</p>
<p>every material and size, appear in temples and homes, and in the city
squares; the cow itself is the most popular organism in India, and has
full freedom of the streets; its dung is used as fuel or a holy
ointment; its urine is a sacred wine that will wash away all inner or
outer uncleanness. Under no circumstances are these animals to be eaten
by a Hindu, nor is their flesh to be worn as clothing — headgear or
gloves or shoes; and when they die they are to be buried with the pomp
of religious ritual . 35 Perhaps wise statesmanship once decreed this
tabu in order to preserve agricultural draft animals for the growing
population of India ; 33 today, however, they number almost one-fourth
as many as the population . 37 The Hindu view is that it is no more
unreasonable to feel a profound affection for cows, and a profound
revulsion at the thought of eating them, than it is to have similar
feelings in regard to domestic cats and dogs; the cynical view of the
matter is that the Brahmans believed that cows should never be
slaughtered, that insects should never be injured, and that widows
should, be burned alive. The truth is that the worship of animals occurs
in the history of every people, and that if one must deify any animal,
the kind and placid cow seems entitled to her measure of devotion. We
must not be too haughtily shocked by the menagerie of Hindu gods; we too
have had our serpent-devil of Eden, our golden calf of the Old
Testament, our sacred fish of the catacombs, and our gracious Lamb of
God.</p>
<p>The secret of polytheism is the inability of the simple mind to
think</p>
<p>in impersonal terms; it can understand persons more readily than
forces, wills more easily than laws . 38 The Hindu suspects that our
human senses see only the outside of the events that they report; behind
the veil of these phenomena, he thinks, there are countless
superphysical beings whom, in Kant’s phrase, we can on ly conceive but
never perceive. A certain philosophical tolerance in the Brahmans has
added to the teeming pantheon of India; local or tribal gods have been
received into the Hindu Valhalla</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 51I</p>
<p>by adoption, usually by interpreting them as aspects or avatars of
accepted deities; every faith could get its credentials if it paid its
dues. In the end nearly every god became a phase, attribute or
incarnation of another god, until all these divinities, to adult Hindu
minds, merged into one; poly- theism became pantheism, almost
monotheism, almost monism. Just as a good Christian may pray to the
Madonna or one of a thousand saints, and yet be a monotheist in the
sense that he recognizes one God as supreme, so the Hindu prays to Kali
or Rama or Krishma or Ganesha without presuming for a moment that these
are supreme deities.* Some Hindus recognize Vishnu as supreme, and call
Shiva merely a subordinate divinity; some call Shiva supreme, and make
Vishnu an angel; if only a few worship Brahma it is because of its
impersonality, its intangibility, its distance, and for the same reason
that most churches in Christendom were erected to Mary or a saint, while
Christianity waited for Voltaire to raise a chapel to God.</p>

which they were written, and the metaphysics of the Brahman schools
being beyond the comprehension of the people, Vyasa and others, over a
period of a thousand years (500 b.c. — 500 a.d.), composed eighteen
Puranas — “old stories”— in 400,000 couplets, expounding to the laity
the exact truth about the creation of the world, its periodical
evolution and dissolution, the genealogy of the gods, and the history of
the heroic age. These books made no pretense to literary form, logical
order, or numer- ical moderation; they insisted that the lovers Urvashi
and Pururavas spent 61,000 years in pleasure and delight. 80 But through
the intelligibility of their language, the attractiveness of their
parables, and the orthodoxy of their doctrine they became the second
Bible of Hinduism, the grand repository of its superstitions, its myths,
even of its philosophy. Here, for example, in the Vishnupurana, is the
oldest and ever-recurrent theme</p>

<p>of Hindu thought — that individual separateness is an illusion, and
that all life is one:</p>
<p>After a thousand years came Ribhu</p>
<p>To Nidagha’s city, to impart further knowledge to him.</p>
<p>He saw him outside the city</p>
<p>Just as the King was about to enter with a great train of
attendants,</p>
<p>Standing afar and holding himself apart from the crowd,</p>
<p>His neck wizened with fasting, returning from the wood with fuel</p>
<p>and grass.</p>
<p>When Ribhu saw him, he went to him and greeted him and said:</p>
<p>“O Brahman, why standest thou here alone?”</p>
<p>Nidagha said: “Behold the crowd pressing about the King,</p>
<p>Who is just entering the city. That is why I stand alone.”</p>
<p>Ribhu said: “Which of these is the King?</p>
<p>And who are the others?</p>
<p>Tell me that, for thou seemest informed.”</p>
<p>Nidagha said: “He who rides upon the fiery elephant, towering</p>
<p>like a mountain peak,</p>
<p>That is the King. The others are his attendants.”</p>
<p>Ribhu said: “These two, the King and the elephant, are pointed
out</p>
<p>by you</p>
<p>Without being separated by mark of distinction;</p>
<p>Give me the mark of distinction between them.</p>
<p>I would know, which is here the elephant and which the King.”</p>
<p>Nidagha said: “The elephant is below, the King is above him;</p>
<p>Who does not know the relationship of borne to bearer?”</p>
<p>Ribhu said: “That I may know, teach me.</p>
<p>What is t hat which is indicated by the word ‘below’, and what is</p>
<p>‘above’?”</p>
<p>Straight Nidagha sprang upon the Guru * and said to him:</p>
<p>“Hear now, I will tell thee what thou demandest of me:</p>
<p>I am above like the King. You are below, like the elephant.</p>
<p>For thy i nstruction I give thee this example.”</p>
<p>Ribhu said: “If you are in the position of the King, and I in that
of</p>
<p>the elephant,</p>
<p>So tell me this still: Which of us is you, and which is I?”</p>
<p>Then swiftly Nidagha, falling down before him, clasped his feet</p>
<p>and spake:</p>
<p>Teacher.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 5 1 3</p>
<p>“Truly thou art Ribhu, my Master. . . .</p>
<p>By this I know that thou, my Guru , art come.”</p>
<p>Ribhu said: “Yes, to give thee teaching,</p>
<p>Because of thy former willingness to serve me,</p>
<p>I, Ribhu by name, am come to thee.</p>
<p>And what I have just taught thee in short —</p>
<p>Heart of highest truth — that is complete non- duality.”*</p>
<p>When he had thus spoken to Nidagha the Guru Ribhu departed</p>
<p>thence.</p>
<p>But forthwith Nidagha, taught by this symbolic teaching, turned
his</p>
<p>mind completely to non-duality.</p>
<p>All beings from thenceforth he saw not distinct from himself.</p>
<p>And so he saw Brahman. And thus he achieved the highest sal-</p>
<p>vation. 81</p>
<p>In these Furanas , and kindred writings of medieval India, we find a
very modern theory of the universe. There is no creation in the sense of
Genesis; the world is perpetually evolving and dissolving, growing and
decaying, through cycle after cycle, like every plant in it, and every
organism.</p>
<p>Brahma — or, as the Creator is more often called in this literature,
Prajapati — is the spiritual force that upholds this endless process. We
do not know how the universe began, if it did; perhaps, say the Furanas
, Brahma laid it as an egg and then hatched it by sitting on it; perhaps
it is a passing error of the Maker, or a little joke. 82 Each cycle or
Kalpa in the history of the universe is divided into a thousand
mahayugas , or great ages, of 4,320,000 years each; and each mahayuga
contains four yugas or ages, in which the hu- man race undergoes a
gradual deterioration. In the present mahayuga three ages have now
passed, totaling 3,888,888 years; we live in the fourth age, the
Kali-yuga , or Age of Misery; 5035 years of this bitter era have
elapsed, but 426,965 remain. Then the world will suffer one of its
periodical deaths, and Brahma will begin another “day of Brahma,” i.e.,
a Kalpa of 4,320,000,000 years. In each Kalpa cycle the universe
develops by natural means and processes, and by natural means and
processes decays; the de- struction of the whole world is as certain as
the death of a mouse, and, to the philosopher, not more important. There
is no final purpose towards which the whole creation moves; there is no
“progress”; there is only end - less repetition. 33</p>
<p>Through all these ages and great ages billions of souls have passed
from species to species, from body to body, from life to life, in weary
trans-</p>

<p>5 14 the story of civilization (chap. XVIII</p>
<p>migration. An individual is not really an individual, he is a link in
the</p>
<p>chain of life, a page in the chronicle of a soul; a species is not
really a separate species, for the souls in these flowers or fleas may
yesterday have been, or tomorrow may be, the spirits of men; all life is
one. A man is only partly a man, he is also an animal; shreds and echoes
of past lower existences linger in him, and make him more akin to the
brute than to the sage. Man is only a part of nature, not actually its
center or master” a life is only a part of a soul’s career, not the
entirety; every form is transi - tory, but every reality is continuous
and one. The many reincarnations of a soul are like years or days in a
single life, and may bring the soul now to growth, now to decay. How can
the individual life, so brief in the</p>
<p>tropic torrent of generations, contain all the history of a soul, or
give it due punishment and reward for its evil and its good? And if the
soul is immortal, how could one short life determine its fate
forever?*</p>
<p>Life can be understood, says the Hindu, only on the assumption that
each existence is bearing the penalty or enjoying the fruits of vice or
virtue in some antecedent life. No deed small or great, good or bad, can
be without effect; everything will out. This is the Law of Karina — the
Law of the Deed — the law of causality in the spiritual world; and it is
the highest and most terrible law of all. If a man does justice and
kindness without sin his reward cannot come in one mortal span; it is
stretched over other lives in which, if his virtue persists, he will be
reborn into loftier place and larger good fortune; but if he lives
evilly he will be reborn as an Outcaste, or a weasel, or a dog.^f This
law of Karma, like the Greek Moira or Fate, is above both gods and men;
even the gods do not change its absolute operation; or, as the
theologians put it, Karma and the will or action of the gods are one .
38 But Karma is not Fate; Fate implies the helplessness of man to
determine his own lot; Karma makes him (taking all his lives as a whole)
the creator of his own destiny. Nor do heaven and hell end the work of
Karma, or the chain of births and deaths; the soul, after the death of
the body, may go to hell for special punishment, or to heaven for quick
and special reward; but no soul stays in hell, and few souls stay in
heaven, forever; nearly every soul that enters them must</p>
<p>*When the Hindu is asked why we have no memory of our past
incarnations, he answers that likewise we have no memory of our infancy;
and as we presume our infancy to explain our maturity, so he presumes
past existences to explain our place and fate in our present life.</p>
<p>t A monk explained his appetite on the ground that in a previous
existence he had been an elephant, and Karma had forgotten to change the
appetite with the body. 88 A woman of strong odor was believed to have
been formerly a fish. 87</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 515</p>
<p>sooner or later return to earth, and live out its Karma in new
incar-</p>
<p>nations.”*</p>
<p>Biologically there was much truth in this doctrine. We are the
rein-</p>
<p>carnations of our ancestors, and will be reincarnated in our
children; and the defects of the fathers are to some extent (though
perhaps not as much as good conservatives suppose) visited upon the
children, even through many generations. Karma was an excellent myth for
dissuading the</p>
<p>human beast from murder, theft, procrastination, or offertorial
parsimony; furthermore, it extended the sense of moral unity and
obligations to all life, and gave the moral code an extent of
application far greater, and more logical, than in any other
civilization. Good Hindus do not kill</p>
<p>insects if they can possibly avoid it; “even those wh ose aspirations
to virtue are modest treat animals as humble brethren rather than as
lower creatures over whom they have dominion by divine command .” 41
Philo - sophically, Karma explained for India many facts otherwise
obscure in meaning or bitterly unjust. All those eternal inequalities
among men which so frustrate the eternal demands for equality and
justice; all the diverse forms of evil that blacken the earth and redden
the stream of history; all the suffering that enters into human life
with birth and accompanies it unto death, seemed intelligible to the
Hindu who accepted Karma ; these evils and injustices, these variations
between idiocy and genius, poverty and wealth, were the results of past
existences, the inevitable working out of a law unjust for a life or a
moment, but perfectly just in the end.f Karma is one of those many
inventions by which men have sought to bear</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hindus believe in seven heavens, one of them on earth, the
others rising in gradations above it; there are twenty-one hells,
divided into seven sections. Punishment is not eternal, but it is
diversified. Pere Dubois’ description of the Hindu hells rivals Dante’s
account of Inferno, and illustrates, like it, the many fears, and the
sadistic imagination, of mank ind. “Fire, steel, serpents, venomous
insects, savage beasts, birds of prey, gall, poison, stenches; in a
word, everything possible is employed to torment the damned. Some have a
cord run through their nostrils, by which they are forever dragged over
the edges of extremely sharp knives; others are condemned to pass
through the eye of a needle; others are placed between two flat rocks,
which meet, and crush, without killing, them; others have their eyes
pecked incessantly by famished vultures; while millions of them continu-
ally swim and paddle in a pool filled with the urine of dogs or with the
mucus from men’s nostrils .” 40 Such beliefs were probably the privilege
of the lowest Hindus and the</li>
</ul>
<p>fThe belief in Karma and transmigration is the greatest theoretical
obstacle to the re- moval of the caste system from India; for the
orthodox Hindu presumes that caste dif- ferences are decreed by the
soul’s conduct in past lives, and are part of a divine plan which it
would be sacrilegious to disturb.</p>
<p>5 1&lt;5 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>evil patiently, and to face life with hope. To explain evil, and to
find</p>
<p>for men some scheme in which they may accept it, if not with good
cheer, then with peace of mind — this is the task that most religions
have at- tempted to fulfill. Since the real problem of life is not
suffering but un- deserved suffering, the religion of India mitigates
the human tragedy by giving meaning and value to grief and pain. The
soul, in Hindu theology, has at least this consolation, that it must
bear the consequences only of its own acts; unless it questions all
existence it can accept evil as a passing punishment, and look forward
to tangible rewards for virtue borne.</p>
<p>But in truth the Hindus do question all existence. Oppressed with an
enervating environment, national subjection and economic exploitation,
they have tended to look upon life as more a bitter punishment than an
opportunity or a reward. The Vedas, written by a hardy race coming in
from the north, were almost as optimistic as Whitman; Buddha, rep-
resenting the same stock five hundred years later, already denied the
value of life; the Puranas, five centuries later still, represented a
view more pro- foundly pessimistic than anything known in the West
except in stray moments of philosophic doubt.* The East, until reached
by the Industrial Revolution, could not understand the zest with which
the Occident has taken life; it saw only superficiality and childishness
in our merciless busyness, our discontented ambition, our nerve-racking
labor-saving de- vices, our progress and speed; it could no more
comprehend this pro- found immersion in the surface of things, this
clever refusal to look ulti- mates in the face, than the West can fathom
the quiet inertia, the “stag - nation” and “hopelessness” of the
traditional East. Heat cannot under - stand cold.</p>
<p>“What is the most wonderful thing in the world?” asks Yama of</p>
<p>Yudishthira; and Yudishthira replies: “Man after man dies; seeing
this, men still move about as if they were immortal.”“ “By death the
world is afflicted,” say the Mahabharata, “by age i t is held in bar,
and the nights</p>
<ul>
<li>Schopenhauer, like Buddha, reduced all suffering to the will to live
and beget, and advocated race suicide by voluntary sterility. Heine
could hardly pen a stanza without speaking of death, and could write, in
Hindu strain,</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweet is sleep, but death is better;</p>
<p>Best of all is never to be bom.* 2</p>
<p>Kant, scorning the optimism of Leibnitz, asked: “Would any man of
sound understanding who has lived long enough, and has meditated on the
worth of human existence, care to go again through life’s poor play, I
do not say on the same conditions, but on any condi - tions whatever?”
48</p>
<p>CHAP.XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 517</p>
<p>are the Unfailing Ones that are ever coming and going. When I know
that death cannot halt, what can I expect from walking in a cover of
lore ?” 46 And in the Ramayana Sita asks, as her reward for fidelity
through every temptation and trial, only death:</p>
<p>If in truth unto my husband I have proved a faithful wife,</p>
<p>Mother Earth, relieve thy Sita from the burden of this life! 46</p>
<p>So the last word of Hindu religious thought is moksha , release —
first from desire, then from life. Nirvana may be one release or the
other; but it is fullest in both. The sage Bhartri-hari expresses the
first:</p>
<p>Everything on earth gives cause for fear, and the only freedom</p>
<p>from fear is to be found in the renunciation of all desire. . . .
Once</p>
<p>upon a time the days seemed long to me when my heart was sorely
wounded through asking favors from the rich; and yet again the</p>
<p>days seemed all too short for me when I sought to carry out all
my</p>
<p>worldly desires and ends. But now as a philosopher I sit on a
hard</p>
<p>stone in a cave on the mountainside, and time and again I laugh</p>
<p>when I think of my former life.“</p>
<p>Gandhi expresses the second form of release: “I do not want to be re
- born,” he says . 48 The highest and final aspiration of the Hindu is
to escape reincarnation, to lose that fever of ego which revives with
each individual body and birth. Salvation does not come by faith, nor
yet by works; it comes by such uninterrupted self-denial, by such
selfless intuition of the part-engulfing Whole, that at last the self is
dead, and there is nothing to be reborn. The hell of individuality
passes into the haven and heaven of unity, of complete and impersonal
absorption into Brahman, the soul or Force of the World.</p>

<li>CURIOSITIES OF RELIGION</li>

<p>Superstitions — Astrology — Phallic worship — Ritual — Sacrifice</p>
<p>— Purification — The sacred waters</p>
<p>Amid all this theology of fear and suffering, superstition — first
aid</p>
<p>from the supernatural for the minor ills of life — flourished with
rank fer- tility. Oblations, charms, exorcisms, astrology, oracles,
incantations, vows.</p>
<p>5 18 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>palmistry, divination, 2,728,812 priests, a million fortune-tellers,
a hun- dred thousand snake-charmers, a million fakirs, yogis and other
holy men — this is one part of the historic picture of India. For twelve
hundred years the Hindus have had a great number of Tantras (manuals)
expounding mysticism, witchcraft, divination and magic, and formulating
the holy mantras (spells) by which almost any purpose might be
magically</p>
<p>attained. The Brahmans looked with silent contempt upon this religion
of magic; they tolerated it partly because they feared that superstition
among the people might be essential to their own power, partly, perhaps,
because they believed that superstition is indestructible, dying in one
form only to be reborn in another. No man of sense, they felt, would 1
quarrel with a force capable of so many reincarnations.</p>
<p>The simple Hindu, like many cultured Americans,* accepted astrology,
and took it for granted that every star exercised a special influence
over those born under its ascendancy.” Menstruating women, like Ophelia,
were to keep out of the sunshine, for this might make them pregnant/ 1
The secret of material prosperity, said the Kaushitaki Upanishad, is the
regular adoration of the new moon. Sorcerers, necromancers and sooth-
sayers, for a pittance, expounded the past and the future by studying
palms, ordure, dreams, signs in the sky, or holes eaten into cloth by
mice. Chanting the charms which only they knew how to recite, they
laid</p>
<p>ghosts, bemused cobras, enthralled birds, and forced the gods
themselves to come to the aid of the contributor. Magicians, for the
proper fee, in- troduced a demon into one’s enemy, or expelled it from
one’s self; they caused the enemy’s sudden death, or brought him down
with an incurable disease. Even a Brahman, when he yawned, snapped his
fingers to right and left to frighten away the evil spirits that might
enter his mouth, t At all times the Hindu, like many European peasants,
was on his guard against the evil eye; at any time he might be visited
with misfortune, or death, magically brought upon him by his enemies.
Above all, the ma- gician could restore sexual vitality, or inspire love
in any one for any one, or give children to barren women. 63</p>
<p>There was nothing, not even Nirvana , that the Hindu desired so
in-</p>
<p>tensely as children. Hence, in part, his longing for sexual power,
and his</p>

<p>CHAP. XVIIl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 519</p>
<p>ritual adoration of the symbols of reproduction and fertility.
Phallic</p>
<p>worship, which has prevailed in most countries at one time or
another, has persisted in India from ancient times to the twentieth
century. Shiva was its deity, the phallus was its ikon, the Tantras were
its Talmud. The Shakti, or energizing power, of Shiva was conceived
sometimes as his consort Kali, sometimes as a female element in Shiva’s
nature, which i n- cluded both male and female powers; and these two
powers were repre- sented by idols called linga or yoni, representing
respectively the male or the female organs of generation.” Everywhere in
India one sees signs of this worship of sex: in the phallic figures on
the Nepalese and other temples in Benares; in the gigantic lingas that
adorn or surround the Shivaite temples of the south; in phallic
processions and ceremonies, and in the phallic images worn on the arm or
about the neck. Linga stones may be seen on the highways; Hindus break
upon them the cocoanuts which they are about to offer in sacrifice.” At
the Rameshvaram Temple the linga stone is daily washed with Ganges
water, which is afterwards sold to the pious,” as holy water or mesmeriz
ed water has been sold in Europe. Usually the phallic ritual is simple
and becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated water
or oil, and decorating it with leaves.”</p>
<p>Doubtless the lower orders in India derive some profane amusement
from phallic processions;“ but for the most part the people appear to
find no more obscene stimulus in the linga or the yoni than a Christian
does in the contemplation of the Madonna nursing her child; custom lends
propriety, and time lends sanctity, to anything. The sexual symbolism of
the objects seems long since to have been forgotten by the people; the
images are now merely the traditional and sacred ways of representing
the power of Shiva.” Perhaps the difference between the European and the
Hindu conception of this matter arose from divergence in the age of
marriage; early marriage releases those impulses which, when long frus-
trated, turn in upon themselves and beget prurience as well as romantic
love. The sexual morals and manners of India are in general higher than
those of Europe and America, and far more decorous and restrained. The
worship of Shiva is one of the most austere and ascetic of all the Hindu
cults; and the devoutest worshipers of the linga are the Lingayats — the
most Puri tanic sect in India.” “It has remained for our Western</p>
<p>visitors,” says Gandhi, “to acquaint us with the obscenity of many
prac -</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>tices which we have hitherto innocently indulged in. It was in a
missionary book that I first learned that Shivalingam had any obscene
significance at all .” 80</p>
<p>The use of the linga and the yoni was but one of the myriad
rituals</p>
<p>that seemed, to the passing and alien eye, not merely the form but
half the essence of Indian religion. Nearly every act of life, even to
washing and dressing, had its religious rite. In every pious home there
were private and special gods to be worshiped, and ancestors to be
honored, every day; indeed religion, to the Hindu, was a matter for
domestic observances rather than for temple ceremonies, which were
reserved for holydays. But the people rejoiced in the many feasts that
marked the ecclesiastical year and brought them in great processions or
pilgrimages to their ancient shrines. They could not understand the
service there, for it was conducted in Sanskrit, but they could
understand the idol. They decked it with orna- ments, covered it with
paint, and encrusted it with jewels; sometimes they treated it as a
human being — awakened it, bathed it, dressed it, fed it, scolded it,
and put it to bed at the close of the day . 01</p>
<p>The great public rite was sacrifice or offering; the great private
rite was purification. Sacrifice, to the Hindu, was no empty form; he
believed that if no food was offered them the gods would starve to death
. 02 When men were cannibals human sacrifices were offered in India as
elsewhere; Kali particularly had an appetite for men, but the Brahmans
explained that she would eat only men of the lower castes. 00 * As
morals improved, the gods had to content themselves with animals, of
which great numbers were offered them. The goat was especially favored
for these ceremonies. Buddhism, Jainism and ahimsa put an end to animal
sacrifice in Hindu- stan , 07 but the replacement of Buddhism with
Hinduism restored the cus- tom, which survived, in diminishing extent,
to our own time. It is to the credit of the Brahmans that they refused
to take part in any sacrifice that involved the shedding of blood .
08</p>
<p>Purification rites took many an hour of Hindu life, for fears of
pollution were as frequent in Indian religion as in modern hygiene. At
any moment the Hindu might be made unclean — by improper food, by offal,
by the touch of a Shudra, an Outcaste, a corpse, a menstruating woman,
or in a</p>
<p>*Such human sacrifices were recorded as late as 1854. 64 It was
formerly believed that de- votees had offered themselves as sacrifices,
as in the case of fanatics supposed to have thrown themselves under the
wheels of the Juggernaut (Indian Jagannath) car; 05 but it is now held
that the rare cases of such apparent self-sacrifice may have been
accidents 68</p>
<p>CHAP, xvm) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 521</p>
<p>hundred other ways. The woman herself, of course, was defiled by men-
struation or childbirth; Brahmanical law required isolation in such
cases, and complex hygienic precautions.® After all such pollutions —
or, as we should say, possible infections — the Hindu had to undergo
ritual purifica- tion: in minor cases by such simple ceremonies as being
sprinkled with holy water;™ in major cases by more complicated methods,
culminating in the terrible Panchagavia. This purification was decreed
as punishment for violating important caste laws (e.g., for leaving
India), and consisted in drinking a mixture of “five substances” from
the sacred cow: milk, curds, ghee, urine and dung. 71 *</p>
<p>A little more to our taste was the religious precept to bathe daily;
here again a hygienic measure, highly desirable in a semitropical
climate, was clothed in a religious form for more successful
inculcation. “Sacred”</p>
<p>pools and tanks were built, many rivers were called holy, and men
were told that if they bathed in these they would be purified in body
and soul. Already in the days of Yuan Chwang millions bathed in the
Ganges every morning™ from that century to ours those waters have never
seen the</p>
<p>“Om, Om, Om.” Benares became the Holy City of India, the goal</p>
<p>of millions of pilgrims, the haven of old men and women come from
every part of the country to bathe in the river, and so to face
death</p>
<p>sinless and clean. There is an element of awe, even of terror, in</p>
<p>the thought that such men have come to Benares for two thousand
years, and have gone down shivering into its waters in the winter dawn,
and smelled with misgiving the flesh of the dead on the burning ghats,
and uttered the same trusting prayers, century after century, to the
same silent deities. The unresponsiveness of a god is no obstacle to</p>
<p>his popularity; India believes as strongly today as ever in the gods
that have so long looked down with equanimity upon her poverty and her
desolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghee is clarified butter. Urine, says the Abbe Dubois (1820), “is
looked upon as most efficacious for purifying any kind of uncleanness. I
have often seen superstitious Hindus following the cows to pasture,
waiting for the moment when they could collect the precious liquid in
vessels of brass, and carrying it away while still warm to their houses.
I have also seen them waiting to catch it in the hollow of their hands,
drinking some of it and rubbing their faces and heads with the rest.” 72

<p>V. SAINTS AND SCEPTICS</p>
<p>Methods of sanctity — Heretics — Toleration — General view of</p>
<p>Hindu Religion</p>
<p>Saints seem more abundant in India than elsewhere, so that at last
the visitor feels that they are a natural product of the country, like
the poppy or the snake. Hindu piety recognized three main avenues to
sanctity: Jnana - yoga, the Way of Meditation, Karma-yoga , the Way of
Action, and</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga , the Way of Love. The Brahmans allowed for all three by
their rule of the four Ashramas , or stages of sanctity. The young
Brahman was to begin as a Brahmachari , vowed to premarital chastity, to
piety, study, truth- fulness, and loving service of his Guru or teacher.
After marriage, which he should not delay beyond his eighteenth year, he
was to enter the second stage of Brahmanical life as Grihastha , or
householder, and beget sons for the care and worship of himself and his
ancestors. In the third stage (now seldom practiced) the aspirant to
sanctity retired with his wife to live as a V anaprasth a , or
jungle-dweller, accepting hard conditions gladly, and limit- ing sexual
relations to the begetting of children. Finally the Brahman who wished
to reach the highest stage might, in his old age, leave even his wife,
and become a Sannyasi , or “abandoner” of the world; giving up all prop
- erty, all money and all ties, he would keep only an antelope skin for
his body, a staff for his hand, and a gourd of water for his thirst. He
must smear his body with ashes every day, drink the Five Substances
frequently, and live entirely by alms. “He must,” says the Brahmanical
Rule, “regard all men as equals. He must not be influenced by anything
that happens, and must be able to view with perfect equanimity even
revolutions that over- throw empires. His one object must be to acquire
that measure of wisdom and of spirituality which shall finally reunite
him to the Supreme Divinity, from which we are separated by our passions
and our material surround- ings.” 74 *</p>
<p>In the midst of all this piety one comes occasionally upon a
sceptical voice stridently out of tune with the solemnity of the normal
Hindu</p>
<p>note. Doubtless when India was wealthy, sceptics were numerous, for
humanity doubts its gods most when it prospers, and worships them most
when it is miserable. We have noted the Charvakas and other heretics of
Buddha’s time. Almost as old is a work called, in the sesquipedalian</p>

<p>fashion of the Hindus, Shivasamvedy opanishad, which simplifies
theology into four propositions: (1) that there is no reincarnation, no
god, no heaven, no hell, and no world; (2) that all traditional
religious literature is the work of conceited fools; (3) that Nature the
originator and Time the destroyer are the rulers of all things, and take
no account of virtue or vice in awarding happiness or misery to men; and
(4) that people, deluded by flowery speech, cling to gods, temples and
priests, when in reality there is no difference between Vishnu and a
dog.™ With all the inconsistency of a Bible harboring Ecclesiastes, the
Pali canon of Bud- dhism offers us a remarkable treatise, probably as
old as Christianity, called “The Questions of King Milinda,” in which
the Buddhist teacher Naga - sena is represented as giving very
disturbing answers to the religious in- quiries made of him by the
Greco-Bactrian King Menander, who ruled northern India at the turn of
the first century before Christ. Religion, says Nagasena, must not be
made a mere way of escape for suffering men; it should be an ascetic
search for sanctity and wisdom without presuming a heaven or a god; for
in truth, this saint assures us, these do not exist.” The Mahabharata
inveighs against doubters and atheists who, it tells us, deny the
reality of souls, and despise immortality; such men, it says, “wander
over the whole earth”; and it warns them of their future punish - ment
by the horrible example of a jackal who explains his species by
admitting that in a previous incarnation h e had been “a rationalist, a
critic of the Vedas, … a reviler and opposer of priests, … an un-</p>
<p>believer, a doubter of all.”™ The Bhagavad -Gita refers to heretics
who deny the existence of a god and describe the world as “none other
than a House of Lust.”™ The Brahmans themselves were often sceptics, but
too completely so to attack the religion of the people. And though the
poets of India are as a rule assiduously pious, some of them, like Kabir
and Vemana, speak in defense of a very emancipated theism. Vemana, a
South Indian poet of the seventeenth century, writes scornfully of
ascetic hermits, pilgrimages, and caste:</p>
<p>The solitariness of a dog! the meditations of a crane! the
chanting</p>
<p>of an ass! the bathing of a frog! . . . How are you the better
for</p>
<p>smearing your body with ashes? Your thoughts should be set on</p>
<p>God alone; for the rest, an ass can wallow in dirt as well as you. .
. .</p>
<p>The books called Vedas are like courtesans, deluding men, and</p>
<p>wholly unfathomable; but the hidden knowledge of God is like an</p>
<p>5^4 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>honorable wife. . . . Will the application of white ashes do away</p>
<p>with the smell of a wine-pot? — will a cord cast over your neck</p>
<p>make you twice-born? . . . Why should we constantly revile the</p>
<p>Pariah? Are not his flesh and blood the same as our own? And of</p>
<p>what caste is He who pervades the Pariah? . . . He who says, “I</p>
<p>know nothing” is the shrewdest of all . 80</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that pronouncements of this kind could be made
with impunity in a society mentally ruled by a priestly caste.
Except</p>
<p>for foreign repressions (and perhaps because of alien rulers
indifferent to native theologies) India has enjoyed a freedom of thought
far greater than that of the medieval Europe to which its civilization
corresponds; and the Brahmans have exercised their authority with
discrimination and lenience. They relied upon the conservatism of the
poor to preserve the orthodox religion, and they were not disappointed.
When heresies or strange gods became dangerously popular they tolerated
them, and then absorbed them into the capacious caverns of Hindu belief;
one god more or less could not make much difference in India. Hence
there has been comparatively little sectarian animosity within the Hindu
community, though much between Hindus and Moslems; and no blood has been
shed for religion in India except by its invaders . 81 Intolerance came
with Islam and Christianity; the Moslems proposed to buy Paradise with
the blood of “infidels,” and the Portuguese, when they captured Goa,
introduced the Inquisition into India . 83</p>
<p>If we look for common defining elements in this jungle of faiths, we
shall find them in the practical unanimity of the Hindus in worshiping
both Vishnu and Shiva, in reverencing the Vedas, the Brahmans, and the
cow, and in accepting the Mahabharata and the Ramayana as no mere
literary epics, but as the secondary scriptures of the race . 88 It is
significant that the deities and dogmas of India today are not those of
the Vedas; in a sense Hinduism represents the triumph of aboriginal
Dravidic India over the Aryans of the Vedic age. As the result of
conquest, spoliation and poverty, India has been injured in body and
soul, and has sought refuge from harsh terrestrial defeat in the easy
victories of myth and imagination. Despite its elements of nobility,
Buddhism, like Stoicism, was a slave philosophy, even if voiced by a
prince; it meant that all desire or struggle, even for personal or
national freedom, should be abandoned, and that the ideal was a
desireless passivity; obviouslv the exhausting heat</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIXl) THE PARADISE OF THE GODS 525</p>
<p>of India spoke in this rationalization of fatigue. Hinduism continued
the weakening of India by binding itself, through the caste system, in
per- manent servitude to a priesthood; it conceived its gods in unmoral
terms, and maintained for centuries brutal customs, like human sacrifice
and suttee, which many nations had long since outgrown; it depicted life
as inevitably evil, and broke the courage and darkened the spirit of its
de- votees; it turned all earthly phenomena into illusion, and thereby
destroyed the distinction between freedom and slavery, good and evil,
corruption and betterment. In the words of a brave Hindu, “Hindu
religion . . .</p>
<p>has now degenerated into an idol-worship and conventional ritualism,
in which the form is regarded as everything, and its substance as
nothing .” 84 A nation ridden with priests and infested with saints,
India awaits with unformulated longing her Renaissance, her Reformation,
and her En- lightenment.</p>
<p>We must, however, keep our historical perspective in thinking of
India; we too were once in the Middle Ages, and preferred mysticism to
science, priestcraft to plutocracy — and may do likewise again. We
cannot judge these mystics, for our judgments in the West are usually
based upon cor- poreal experience and material results, which seem
irrelevant and super- ficial to the Hindu saint. What if wealth and
power, war and conquest, were only surface Illusions, unworthy of a
mature mind? What if this science of hypothetical atoms and genes, of
whimsical protons and cells, of gases generating Shakespeares and
chemicals fusing into Christ, were only one more faith, and one of the
strangest, most incredible and most transitory of all? The East,
resentful of subjection and poverty, may go in for science and industry
at the very time when the children of the West, sick of machines that
impoverish them and of sciences that disillusion them, may destroy their
cities and their machines in chaotic revolution or war, go back, beaten,
weary and starving, to the soil, and forge for themselves another mystic
faith to give them courage in the face of hunger, cruelty, injustice and
death. There is no humorist like history.</p>
