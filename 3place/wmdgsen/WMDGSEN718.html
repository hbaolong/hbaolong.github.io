<h4 id="chapter-vii">CHAPTER VII</h4>
<p>The People and the State</p>
<p>T HE France that Voltaire returned to in 1728 had some nineteen</p>
<p>millions population, divided into three etats (states, or classes):
the</p>
<p>clergy, the nobility, and the tiers etat (Third Estate), all the
rest. We must look at each “state” carefully if we would understand the
Revolution.</p>
<p>I. THE NOBILITY</p>
<p>The territorial seigneurs who derived their titles from the land
they</p>
<p>owned (approximately a fourth of the soil) called themselves la
noblesse (Tepee, the nobility of the sword. Their chief duty was to
organize, and lead the defense of, their seigniory, their region, their
country, and their king. In the first half of the eighteenth century
they headed some eighty thousand families comprising 400,000 souls. 1
They were divided into jealous ranks. At their top stood the offspring
and nephews of the reigning king. Below these were the pairs, or peers,
of France: princes of the blood (lineal descendants of previous kings) ;
seven bishops; fifty dukes. Then came lesser dukes, then marquises, then
counts, viscounts, barons, chevaliers . . . Vari- ous ceremonial
privileges distinguished the several grades; so there were tragic
disputes over the right to walk under parasols in the Corpus Christi
procession, or to sit in the presence of the king.</p>
<p>Within the noblesse (Tepee a minority tracing its titles and
possessions through many generations designated itself la noblesse de
race, and looked down upon those nobles who owed their titles to the
ennoblement of re- cent ancestors or themselves under Louis XIII or
Louis XIV. Some of these new titles had been conferred as reward for
services to the state in war, administration, or finance; some had been
sold for as little as six thousand livres by the late needy Grand
Monarque; in this way, said Voltaire, “a huge number of citizens —
bankers, surgeons, merchants, clerks, and servants of princes — obtained
patents of nobility.” 2 Certain governmental offices, such as chancellor
or chief justice, automatically ennobled their holders. Under Louis XV
any commoner could achieve nobility by buying for</p>
<p>1 20,000 livres appointment as a secretary of state; under Louis XVI
there would be nine hundred such imaginary secretaries. Or one could buy
a</p>
<p>2 5J</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>(chap. VII</p>
<p>title by buying a nobleman’s estate. By 1789 probably ninety -five
per cent of all nobles were of middle-class origin. 3</p>
<p>Among these the majority had arrived at exaltation by studying law
and becoming judicial or administrative magistrates. In this number were
the members of the thirteen parlements that served as law courts in the
greater cities of France. As a magistrate was allowed to transmit his
office to his son, a new hereditary aristocracy took form — la noblesse
de robe, the nobil- ity of the gown. In the judiciary, as in the clergy,
the gown was half the authority. Overwhelming in their scarlet robes,
massive mantles, frilled sleeves, powdered wigs, and plumaged hats, the
members of the parlements ranked just below the bishops and the
territorial nobility. But as some mag- istrates, through their legal
fees, became richer than most pedigreed land- holders, the barriers
between the noblesse d’epee and the noblesse de robe broke down, and by
1789 there was an almost complete amalgamation of the two nobilities.
The class thus formed was then so numerous and power- ful that the King
did not dare oppose it, and only the Jacqueries of the Revolution could
overthrow its costly privileges.</p>
<p>Many of the old nobility were impoverished by careless or absentee
man- agement of their domains, or by unprogressive agricultural methods,
or by exhaustion of the soil, or by depreciation of the currency in
which they received tenant rents or feudal dues; and as nobles were not
supposed to engage in commerce or industry, the growth of manufactures
and trade developed a money economy in which one might own much land and
still be poor. In some districts of France there were hundreds of nobles
as in- digent as the peasantry. 4 But a large minority of nobles enjoyed
and dis- sipated great fortunes. The Marquis de Villette had an annual
income of 150,000 livres, the Due de Chevreuse 400,000, the Due de
Bouillon 500,000. To make their lives more tolerable most nobles were
exempt, except in emergency, from direct taxation. Kings feared to tax
them lest they demand the summoning of a States-General; such a meeting
of the three etats might exact some control over the monarch as the
price of voting subsidies. “Every year,” said de Tocqueville, “ the
inequality of taxation separated classes, . . . sparing the rich and
burdening the poor.” 5 In 1749 an income tax of five per cent was levied
on the nobles, but they prided themselves on evading it.</p>
<p>Before the seventeenth century the landed nobility had served
economic and administrative, as well as military, functions. However
their property had been acquired, the seigneurs organized the division
and cultivation of the soil, either through serfdom or through leasing
parcels to tenants; they provided law and order, trial, adjudication,
and punishment; they main- tained the local school, hospital, and
charity. On hundreds of seigniories the feudal lord had performed these
functions as well as the natural selfish-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE</p>
<p>2 53</p>
<p>ness of men allowed, and the peasants, recognizing his usefulness,
gave him obedience and respect, sometimes even affection.</p>
<p>Two main factors changed this feudal relationship: the appointment of
intendants by and after Cardinal Richelieu, and the transformation of
the major seigneurs into courtiers by Louis XIV. The intendants were
middle- class bureaucrats sent by the king to govern the thirty-two
districts into which France was divided for administration. Usually they
were men of ability and good will, though they were not all Turgots.
They improved the sanitation, lighting, and embellishment of the towns;
they reorganized the finances; they dammed rivers to irrigate the soil,
or diked them to pre- vent floods; they gave France in this century a
magnificent network of roads then unequaled elsewhere in the world, and
began to line them with the trees that shade and adorn them today. 6
Soon their greater diligence and competence displaced the territorial
lords from regional rule. To accelerate this centralizing replacement,
Louis XIV invited the seigneurs to attend him at court; there he gave
them lowly offices glorified with exalted titles and intoxicating
ribbons; they lost touch with local affairs while drawing from their
manors the revenues needed to maintain their palaces and equipages in
Paris or Versailles; they clung to their feudal rights after abandoning
their feudal tasks. Their loss of administrative functions, in both the
econ- omy and the government, opened them to the charge that they were
dis- pensable parasites on the body of France.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CLERGY</li>
</ol>
<p>The Catholic Church was an essential and omnipresent force in the
gov- ernment. The number of her clergy in France has been estimated at
260,000 in 1 667, 7 420,000 in 17 15, 8 194,000 in 1 7 6 2 ; 9 these
figures are guesses, but we may assume a decline of some thirty per cent
during the eighteenth century, despite an increase in the population.
Lacroix calculated that in 1763 France had eighteen archbishops, 109
bishops, 40,000 priests, 50,000 vicaires (assistant priests), 27,000
priors or chaplains, 12,000 canons regu- lar, 20,000 clerks, and 100,000
monks, friars and nuns. 10 Of 740 monas- teries 625 were in commendam —
.e.., they were governed by assistant ab- bots on behalf of absentee
abbots who received the title and half or two thirds of the revenue
without being required to live an ecclesiastical life.</p>
<p>The higher clergy were practically a branch of the nobility. All
bishops were appointed by the king, usually on nomination by the local
seigneurs, and subject to papal consent. Titled families, to keep their
property un- divided by inheritance, secured bishoprics or abbacies for
their younger sons; of 130 bishops in France in 1789 only one was a
commoner. 11 Such</p>
<p>2 54</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>scions of old stock brought into the Church their habits of worldly
luxury, sport, and pride. Prince Cardinal fidouard de Rohan had an alb
bordered with point lace and valued at 100,000 livres, and his kitchen
utensils were of massive silver. 12 Archbishop Dillon of Narbonne
explained to Louis XVI why, after prohibiting the chase to his clergy,
he himself continued to hunt: “Sire, my clergy’s vices are their own;
mine come from my ances - try.” 13 The great age of French
ecclesiastics— Bossuet, Fenelon, Bourdaloue — had passed; the epicurean
riot of the Regency had freed men like Dubois and Tencin to rise in the
hierarchy of the Church despite their achieve- ments in both forms of
venery. Many bishops lived most of the year in Ver- sailles or Paris,
joining in the gaiety and sophistication of the court. They kept one
foot in each world.</p>
<p>Bishops and abbots had the rights and duties of seigneurs, even to
pro- viding a bull to service their peasants’ cows. 14 Their vast
domains, some - times enclosing whole towns, were managed as feudal
properties. Monas- teries owned a great part of the city of Rennes, and
most of the environing terrain. 15 In some communes the bishop appointed
all judges and officials; so the Archbishop of Cambrai, suzerain over a
region comprising 75,000 inhabitants, appointed all administrators in
Cateau-Cambresis, and half of those in Cambrai. 18 Serfdom survived
longest on monastic estates; 17 the canons regular of St.-Claude, in the
Jura, had twelve thousand serfs, and fer- vently resisted any reduction
of feudal services. 18 The immunities and privileges of the Church were
bound up with the existing social order, and made the ecclesiastical
hierarchy the most conservative influence in France.</p>
<p>The Church annually collected, with some moderation and
consideration, a tithe of every landholder’s produce and cattle; but
this decime was seldom an actual tenth; more often it was a twelfth,
sometimes only a twentieth. 19 With this, and gifts, legacies, and the
revenue from her realty, the Church maintained her parish priests in
poverty and her bishops in luxury, she relieved the destitute, and
educated and indoctrinated the young. Next to the king with his army,
the Church was the strongest and richest power in France. She owned, by
diverse estimates, from six to twenty per cent of the soil, 20 and a
third of the wealth. 21 The bishop of Sens had a yearly income of 70,000
livres; the bishop of Beauvais, 90,000; the Archbishop of Rouen,
100,000; of Narbonne, 160,000; of Paris, 200,000; the Archbishop of
Stras- bourg had over a million a year. 22 The Abbey of Premontre, near
Laon. had a capital of 45 million livres. The 236 Dominican friars of
Toulouse owned French property, colonial plantations, and Negro slaves,
valued at many millions. The 1,672 monks of St.-Maur held property worth
24 mil- lion livres, earning eight million a year.</p>
<p>None of the Church’s possessions or income was taxable, but
periodically the higher clergy in national convocation voted a free
donation to the state.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 255</p>
<p>In 1773 this amounted to sixteen million livres for five years, which
Vol- taire reckoned to be a just proportion of the Church’s income. 23
In 1749 J. B. Machault d’Arnouville, comptroller general of finances,
proposed to replace this don gratuit by extending to the Church, as well
as to all the laity, a direct annual tax of five per cent on all income.
Fearing that this was a first step toward despoiling the Church to
salvage the state, the clergy resisted with “an inflexible passion.” 24
Machault proposed also to outlaw legacies to the Church without state
sanction; to annul all religious estab- lishments set up without royal
approval since 1636; and to require all hold- ers of ecclesiastical
benefices to report their revenues to the government. An assembly of the
clergy refused to obey these edicts, saying, “We will never consent that
that which has heretofore been the gift of our love and respect should
become the tribute of our obedience.” Louis XV ordered the dis -
solution of the assembly, and his Council bade the intendants collect an
initial levy of 7,500,000 livres on the property of the Church.</p>
<p>Voltaire sought to encourage Machault and the King by issuing a pam-
phlet, Voix du sage et du peuple, which urged the government to
establish its authority over the Church, to prevent the Church from
being a state within the state, and to trust to the philosophers of
France to defend King and minister against all the forces of
superstition. 25 But Louis XV saw no reason for believing that
philosophy could win in a contest with religion. He knew that half his
authority rested upon his anointment and coronation by the Church;
thereafter, in the eyes of the masses, who could never come close enough
to him to count his mistresses, he was the viceregent of God and spoke
with divine authority. The spiritual terrors wielded by the clergy,
enhanced by all the forces of tradition, habit, ceremony, vestments, and
prestige, took the place of a thousand laws and a hundred thousand
policemen in maintaining social order and public obedience. Could any
government, without the support of supernatural hopes and fears, control
the innate lawlessness of men? The King decided to yield to the bishops.
He transferred Machault to another post, suppressed Voltaire’s pamphlet,
and accepted a don gratuit in lieu of a tax on ecclesiastical
property.</p>
<p>The power of the Church rested ultimately on the success of the
parish priest. If the people feared the mitered hierarchy, they loved
the local cure, who shared their poverty and sometimes their
agricultural toil. They grum- bled when he collected the “tithe,” but
they realized that he was compelled to do it by his superiors, and that
two thirds of it went to his bishop or some absentee beneficiary, while
the parish church, as like as not, languished in a disrepair painful to
piety. That beloved church was their town hall; there their village
assemblies met under the presidency of the priest; in the parish
register, as the witness of their patient continuity through the gen-
erations, were recorded their births, marriages, and deaths. The sound
of</p>
<p>2 5 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>the church bells was the noblest music to their ears; the ceremonies
were their exalting drama; the stories of the saints were their
treasured literature; the feasts of the Church calendar were their
grateful holidays. They did not look upon the exhortations of the
priest, or his instruction of their children, as a mythical
indoctrination to support ecclesiastical authority, but as an
indispensable aid to parental discipline and moral restraint, and as the
revelation of a divine order that redeemed with eternal significance the
dreary routine of their earthly lives. So precious was that faith that
they could be inflamed to kill anyone who tried to take it from them.
The peasant father and mother welcomed religion into the daily routine
of their home, transmitted its legends to their children, and led them
in evening prayer. The parish priest, loving them as they loved him,
sided with them in the Revolution.</p>
<p>Monks, friars, and nuns were diminishing in number and growing in
vir- tue 28 and wealth. They were rarely mendicant now, for they had
found it wiser to elicit bequests from the dying as a fee for Paradise
than to beg pennies in the villages. Some of their wealth overflowed
into charity; many monasteries maintained hospitals and almshouses, and
daily distributed food to the poor. 27 In 1789 many communities urged
the Revolutionary govern- ment not to suppress the local monasteries,
since these were the only chari- table organizations in their region. 28
Nunneries performed several functions now otherwise served: they
provided a refuge for widows, for women separated from their husbands,
and for tired ladies who, like Mme. du Def- fand, wished to live away
from the turmoil of the world. The convents did not entirely renounce
worldly pleasures, for the well-to-do used them as havens for surplus
daughters, who might otherwise, by requiring marriage dowries, have
lessened the patrimony of the sons; and these discarded vir- gins were
not always inclined to austerity. The abbess of Origny had a coach and
four, and entertained both sexes in her comfortable apartment; at Alix
the nuns wore hoopskirts, and silk robes lined with ermine; at other
nunneries they dined and danced with officers from nearby camps. 29
These were apparently sinless relaxations; many of the stories of
conventual im- morality in the eighteenth century were lurid
exaggerations in the propa- ganda war of rival faiths. Instances of
girls kept in convents against their will were now rare. 30</p>
<p>The Jesuits had declined in power and prestige. Till 1762 they still
con- trolled education, and provided influential confessors to King and
Queen. But they had suffered from the eloquence of Pascal and the
skeptics of the impious Regency, and were losing their long contest with
the Jansenists. These Calvinistic Catholics had survived royal
persecution and papal bulls; they were numerous in the business and
artisan classes, and in law; they were nearing ascendancy in the Paris
and other parlements. After the death</p>
<p>CHAP. VII )</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE</p>
<p>2 57</p>
<p>of their ascetic theologian Frangois de Paris (1727), fervent sick
Jansenists made pilgrimages to his tomb in the cemetery of St.-Medard;
there they scourged themselves, and some fell into such cataleptic fits
that they were called convulsionnaires; they groaned and wept, and
prayed for cures, and several claimed to have been miraculously healed.
After three years of these operations the authorities closed the
cemeteries; as Voltaire put it, God was forbidden, by order of the King,
to work any miracles there. The convul- sions ceased, but the
impressionable Parisians were inclined to credit the miracles, and in
1733 a journalist reported, with obvious exaggeration, that “the good
town of Paris is Jansenist from top to bottom.” 31 Many of the lower
clergy, defying a royal edict of 1720, refused to sign the bull Uni -
genitus (1713), wherein Pope Innocent XIII had condemned 1 o 1 allegedly
Jansenist propositions. The Archbishop of Paris ruled that the last
sacra- ment should not be administered to anyone who had not confessed
to a priest who had accepted the bull. The dispute shared in weakening
the divided Church against the attacks of the philosophies.</p>
<p>Huguenots and other French Protestants were still outlawed, but small
groups of them gathered clandestinely. Legally a French Protestant’s
wife was a concubine; her children were accounted illegitimate, and
could not inherit property. Under Louis XV there were several outbreaks
of persecu- tion. In 1717 seventy-four Frenchmen caught in Protestant
worship were sent to the galleys, and their women were jailed. An edict
of 1724 decreed death for Protestant preachers; all persons attending a
Protestant assemblage were to suffer confiscation of property, the men
were to be condemned to the galleys, the women were to have their heads
shaved and be shut up for life. 32 During the ministry of Cardinal
Fleury this edict was only laxly en- forced, but after his death it was
revived at the request of Catholic bishops in southern France. 33 In
1749 the Parlement of Bordeaux ordered the sepa- ration of forty-six
couples who had been married by Protestant rites. Chil- dren of parents
who were suspected of Protestantism could be taken from them to be
brought up in Catholic homes; we hear of a rich Huguenot spending
200,000 livres in bribing officials to let him keep his children. 34
Between 1744 and 1752 some six hundred Protestants were imprisoned, and
eight hundred others were condemned to various penalties. 35 In 1752 the
Protestant preacher Benezet, twenty-six years old, was hanged at Mont-
pellier. In that year Louis XV, under the influence of Mme. de
Pompadour, ordered an end to these persecutions; 38 thereafter,
especially in or near Paris, Protestants could escape penalties provided
they attended a Catholic service once in the year. 37</p>
<p>Despite the bigotry, worldliness, and will-to-power of their leaders,
the French clergy included hundreds of men distinguished by laborious
learn- ing or devoted lives. Besides those bishops who squandered in
Paris the tithes</p>
<p>2 5 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>taken from the peasantry, there were others who came as close to
sanctity as administrative duties would permit. Cardinal Louis Antoine
de Noailles, archbishop of Paris, was a man of intelligence and
nobility. Jean Baptiste Massillon, bishop of Clermont, was loved by the
people despite the erudition of his sermons, which Voltaire liked to
listen to at meals, if only for the beauty of their style. Gabriel de
Caylus, bishop of Auxerre, gave all his wealth to the poor, sold his
silver plate to feed the hungry, and then apolo- gized to further
suppliants, “My children, I have nothing left to give you.” 38 Bishop
Francois de Belsunce remained at his post in the terrible plague at
Marseilles (1720), when a third of the population died and most doctors
and magistrates fled. “Look at Belsunce,” wrote Lemontey:</p>
<p>all he possessed he has given; all who served him 〔his personal
staff〕 are dead 〔from infection〕; alone, in poverty, on foot, in the
morning he</p>
<p>penetrates into the most horrible den of misery, and in the evening
he is found again in the midst of places bespattered with the dying;
he</p>
<p>quenches their thirst, he comforts them as a friend, . . . and in
this</p>
<p>field of death he gleans abandoned souls. The example of this
prelate, who seeems to be invulnerable, animates with courageous
emulation . . . the parish priests, the vicars, and the religious
orders; not one</p>
<p>deserts his colors; not one puts any bounds to his fatigue save with
his life. Thus perished twenty-six Recollect friars, and eighteen
Jesuits out of twenty-six. The Capuchins summoned their brethren from

the ancient Christians; out of fifty-five the epidemic slew forty-three.
The conduct of the priests of the Oratory was, if possible, even more
mag- nanimous . 39</p>
<p>Let us remember, as we record the bitter conflict between religion
and philosophy, and share the anger of the philosophes at stifling
censorship and disgraceful superstition, that there was devotion as well
as wealth in the hierarchy; dedication as well as poverty among the
village priests; and, among the people, an abiding, indestructible love
for a faith that gave some saving discipline to pride and passion, and
brought a consoling vision to toilsome days.</p>

<li>THE THIRD ESTATE</li>
</ol>
<p>1 . The Peasantry</p>
<p>The “political economy” that Carlyle branded as the “dismal science”
wondered whether the poor are poor because they are ignorant, or
ignorant because they are poor. The question can be answered by
contrasting the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 259</p>
<p>proud independence of the French paysan today with the degrading
indi- gence of the French peasant in the first half of the eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>His condition was improving in 1723 as compared with the extremity to
which he had been reduced by the wars and exactions of Louis XIV. Sub-
ject to feudal dues and church tithes, he owned a rising proportion of
the soil of France, varying from twenty per cent in Normandy and
Brittany to fifty per cent in Languedoc and Limousin. 40 But the average
holding of these small proprietors was so small — three to five acres —
that they had to support their families by serving as hired hands on
other farms. Most of the land was owned by the nobles, the clergy, or
the king, and was tilled by tenants, by metayers (sharecroppers), or by
day laborers under the disci- pline of a steward. Tenants paid the owner
in money, produce, and service; metayers, in return for land,
implements, and seed, paid the landlord half the crop.</p>
<p>Despite the growth of peasant proprietorship, there remained many
sur- vivals of feudalism. Only a small minority of proprietors — often
as low as two per cent — held land in franc-alleu, i.e., free from
feudal dues. All peas- ants except these “allodial” freeholders were
required to give the local seigneur several days of labor yearly, enough
to plow and plant his acres, reap his harvest, and stow his barns. They
paid him a fee for fishing in the lakes or streams, and for pasturing
their cattle in the fields, of his domain. (In Franche-Comte, Auvergne,
and Brittany, until the Revolution, they paid him for permission to
marry. 41 ) They were obliged to use his mill, his bake- house, his wine
or oil presses, and no other, and to pay for each use. They paid the
lord for every fireplace they had, every well they dug, every bridge
they crossed on his terrain. (Some such taxes exist amongst us today in
altered forms, as paid to the state.) Laws prohibited the lord and his
companions from injuring the peasant’s planting or animals while
hunting, but these edicts were widely ignored, and the peasant was
forbidden to shoot the seig- norial pigeons nibbling on his crops. 42
Altogether, on a conservative estimate, fourteen per cent of the
peasant’s produce or income went to feudal dues; other estimates raise
the proportion. 43</p>
<p>In a few localities literal serfdom remained. A distinguished
economic historian estimated that “the total number of serfs” in
eighteenth -century France “did not exceed one million.” 44 Their number
declined, but there</p>
<p>After paying his feudal dues and ecclesiastical tithes, the peasant
had still to find money, or sell some of his produce or property, in
order to meet the</p>
<p>26 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>taxes laid upon him by the state. He alone paid the taille, or tax on
poses- sessions. In addition he paid a gabelle, or tax on salt, and a
vingtieme — five per cent of income — laid upon every household head.
Altogether he paid a third of his income to the landlord, the Church,
and the state. 46 Tax collec- tors were authorized to enter, or force
their way into, his cottage, search for hidden savings, and take away
furniture to make up the sum allotted to the household as its share of
the tax. And just as the peasant owed the lord labor as well as dues,
so, after 1733, he was compelled to give to the state, annually, twelve
to fifteen days of unpaid labor ( corvee ) for building or repairing
bridges or roads. Imprisonment punished resistance or delay.</p>
<p>Since taxes rose with income and improvements, there was, among the
peasantry, little incentive to invention or enterprise. Agricultural
methods remained primitive in France as compared with those of
contemporary Eng- land. The fallow system left each tract idle every
third year, while England was introducing crop rotation. Intensive
cultivation was almost unknown. Iron plows were rare, there were few
animals on the farm, and little manure. The average holding was too
small to allow the profitable use of machines.</p>
<p>The poverty of the French peasant shocked English travelers in this
age. At every stop, wrote Lady Mary Montagu (1718), “while the post
-horses are changed, the whole town comes out to beg, with such
miserable starved faces, and thin tattered clothes, they need no other
eloquence to persuade the wretchedness of their condition.” 47 French
observers gave no rosier picture until much later in the century. “In
1725,” said Saint - Simon, “the people of Normandy live on the grass of
the fields. The first king in Europe is great simply by being a king of
beggars, . . . and by turning his kingdom into a vast hospital of dying
people, from whom all is taken without a mur- mur.” 48 And in 1 740
Marquis Rene Louis d’ Argenson calculated that “more Frenchmen had died
of want in the last two years than had been killed in all the wars of
Louis XIV.” 49 “The clothing of the poor peasants,” said Besnard, “and
they were almost all poor, was . . . pitiful, for they had only one
outfit for winter and summer. . . . Their single pair of shoes (very
thin, and cleated with nails), which they procured at the time of their
marriage, had to serve them the rest of their lives, or at least as long
as the shoes lasted.” 50 Voltaire estimat ed that two million French
peasants wore wooden shoes in winter and went barefoot in summer, for
high taxes on skins made shoes a luxury. 51 The peasant’s dwelling was
built of mud and roofed with thatch; usually it had but one room, low
and ceilingless; in some parts of northern France, however, cottages
were made stronger to bear the cold and winds of winter. The peasant’s
food consisted of soup, eggs, dairy products, and bread of rye or oats;
meat and wheat bread were occasional dissipations. 52 In France, as
elsewhere, those who fed the nation had the least to eat.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 26 I</p>
<p>From this hard life the peasant found consolation in drunkenness and
re- ligion. Taverns were numerous, and home brews helped. Character was
coarse, brutality was standard, violence flared between individuals,
fam- ilies, and villages. But within the family there was a strong
though silent af- fection. Children were numerous, but death cut most of
them down before maturity; there was hardly any increase in the
population of France be- tween 1715 and 1740. War, disease, and famine
operated with Malthusian regularity.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Proletariat</li>
</ol>
<p>Still lower than the peasant in social status were domestic servants,
who were so poor that few of them could afford to marry. A notch above
the peasantry was the proletariat of the towns: the artisans in shops or
factories, the carriers of goods and purveyors of services, the
craftsmen who built or repaired. Most industry was still domestic,
performed in rural cottages as well as in urban homes; merchants
supplied the material, collected the prod- ucts, and pocketed nearly all
the profit. In the towns industry was largely in the guild stage, with
masters, apprentices, and journeymen working under old rules by which
the guild and the government fixed the hours and conditions of labor,
the types, quality, and price of the product, and the limited
permissible area of sale. These regulations made improvements diffi-
cult, excluded the stimulus of external competition, and shared with
internal traffic tolls in retarding industrial development. The guilds
had become an aristocracy of labor; fees for acceptance as masters ran
as high as two thou- sand livres, and mastership tended to be
hereditary. 53 Work in the shops began early, ended late; around
Versailles the journeymen labored from as early as four in the morning
till as late as eight at night; 54 but toil was less intense than in
factories today, and the ecclesiastical festivals provided numerous
holidays.</p>
<p>Most industry was “petty,” employing only three or four “hands” out -
side the family. Even tanneries, glassworks, and dyeing establishments
were small concerns. In Bordeaux the employees were only four times as
nu- merous as the employers. The government, however, maintained some
large plants — soap factories, the Gobelin tapestry works, and the
porcelain in- dustry at Sevres. Mining was becoming a large operation as
coal replaced wood for fuel. Protests were made about coal smoke
poisoning the air, but industry then as now had its way, and in Paris,
as in London, people breathed at the risk of their health. There were
steelworks in Dauphine, paper mills in Angoumois. Textile factories
reached considerable size in the north; so Van Robais employed fifteen
hundred persons in one mill at</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Abbeville, and Van der Cruissen engaged three thousand men at Lille.
55 Such multiplication encouraged division and specialization of labor,
and stimulated the invention of machinery for routine processes. The
Ency elo- pe die of Diderot (1751 f.) contained descriptions and
drawings of a surpris- ing variety and complexity of mechanisms already
introduced in French industry, seldom to proletarian applause. When the
Jacquard loom was in- stalled at Lyons the silk weavers smashed it to
pieces in fear that it would throw them out of work. 56</p>
<p>To encourage new industries the government, as in Elizabethan
England, granted several monopolies, e.g., to the Van Robais family for
the production of fine Dutch cloths; and it helped other projects with
subsidies and interest- free loans. Over all industry the government
exercised a rigorous regulation, inherited from Colbert. This system
aroused a rising protest from manufac- turers and merchants, who argued
that the economy would expand and prosper if liberated from governmental
interference. It was in voicing this claim that Vincent de Gournay,
toward 1755, uttered the historic phrase “ Laissez faire” (Let it
alone), which in the next generation, with Quesnay and Turgot, would
express the physiocrat plea for free enterprise and free trade.</p>
<p>The artisans too resented the regulations, which severely hampered
their organization for better conditions and pay; but their chief
grievance was that rural and factory labor was capturing the market from
the guilds. By 1756 the manufacturers had reduced the artisans in the
larger cities — and even the guild masters — to the condition of wage
earners dependent upon the entrepreneurs. 57 Within the guilds the
masters underpaid their journey- men, who periodically went on strike.
Poverty in the towns was almost as great as in the villages. Crop
failures brought the urban proletariat to famine and riot every few
years; so at Toulouse in 1747, at Paris in 1751, at Tou- louse in 1 75
2. 58 Already, about 1729, Jean Meslier, the atheist priest, pro- posed
to replace the existing system with a libertarian communism. 59</p>
<p>By the middle of the century Paris, Rouen, Lille, Lyons, Bordeaux,
Mar- seilles were teeming with proletaires. Lyons for a time surpassed
Paris as a manufacturing center. Thomas Gray, the English poet,
described it in 1739 as the “second city of the kingdom in bigness and
rank, its streets excessively narrow and nasty, the houses immensely
high and large (25 rooms on a floor and 5 stories high), and swarming
with inhabitants.” 60 Paris was a turbulent hive of 800,000 souls, of
whom 100,000 were servants and 20,000 were beg- gars; dismal slums and
magnificent palaces; dark alleys and dirty streets be- hind fashionable
promenades; art fronting destitution. Coaches, public cabs, and sedan
chairs were engaged in vituperative collisions and traffic jams. Some
thoroughfares had been paved since 1690; in 1742 Tresaquet paved roads
with rolled stones ( chaussee empierree et route e ); but most of</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 263</p>
<p>the streets were plain dirt, or laid with cobblestones fit for
revolutionary barricades. Street lamps began to replace lanterns in
1745, but were lit only when the moon was not full. Street signs
appeared in 1728, but there were no house numbers before the Revolution.
Only the well-to-do had faucet water in their homes; the rest were
supplied by twenty thousand water car- riers, each bearing two buckets,
sometimes up seven flights of stairs. Water closets in the home, and
bathrooms with running hot and cold water, were privileges of the very
rich. Thousands of shops, marked with their pic- turesque emblems,
maintained their own chaos of discordant and suspected weights and
measures till the Revolution established the metric system. There were
honest shopkeepers in motions de confiance, but the majority had a
reputation for short measures, rigged prices, and shoddy goods. 61 Some
shops were assuming a specious splendor for the carriage trade. Poor
people bought chiefly from peddlers, who laboriously toted their wares
in pails or baskets on their backs, and contributed to the music of the
streets with their traditiona l, unintelligible, welcome cries, from
“Baked potatoes!”</p>
<p>The houses are so high that one would suppose they were inhabited
only by astrologers. You may imagine that a town built in the air, with
six or seven houses the one on the top of the other, is densely popu-
lated, and that when all the inhabitants come down into the street there
is a pretty crush. I have been here a month, and I have not yet seen a
single person walking at a foot-pace. There is no one in the world like
a Frenchman to get over the ground. He runs and flies. 62</p>
<p>Add the beggars, the vagabonds, the pickpockets, the street singers,
the organ players, the medicine mountebanks. All in all, a populace with
a hundred human faults, never to be trusted, always alert for gain,
heartily and profusely profane; but, given a little food and wine, the
kindest, jolliest, brightest populace in the world.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Bourgeoisie</li>
</ol>
<p>Between the lowly and the great, hated by the one and scorned by the
other, the middle class — doctors, professors, administrators,
manufacturers, merchants, financiers — subtly, patiently made its way to
wealth and power. The manufacturers took economic risks, and demanded
commensurate re- wards. They complained that they were harassed in a
hundred ways by governmental regulations, and by guild control of
markets and skills. The</p>
<p>264</p>

<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>merchants who distributed the product raged against a thousand tolls
im- peding the movement of goods; at almost every river, canal, and
crossroads the noble or ecclesiastical lord of the domain had an agent
exacting a fee for permission to proceed. The seigneur explained that
these tolls were a reasonable reimbursement for his expense in keeping
roads, bridges, and ferries in service and repair. A royal edict of 1724
suppressed twelve hun- dred such tolls, but hundreds remained, and
played their part in earning bourgeois support of the Revolution.</p>
<p>French commerce, hampered inland, was spreading overseas. Marseilles,
a free port, dominated European trade with Turkey and the East. The
Compagnie des Indes, reconstituted in 1723, extended its markets and
politi- cal influence in the Caribbean, the Mississippi Valley, and
parts of India. Bordeaux, chief outlet for the Atlantic trade, raised
its maritime commerce from 40 million livres in 1724 to 250 million in
1788. Over three hundred vessels sailed to America from Bordeaux and
Nantes every year, many of them carrying slaves to work the sugar
plantations in the Antilles and Louisiana. 63 Sugar from French America
was now outselling English sugar from Jamaica and Barbados in European
markets; 64 this may have been a motive for the Seven Years’ War. The
total foreign trade of France rose from 215 million livres in 1715 to
600 million in 1750. 65 Voltaire estimated that the number of trading
vessels in French service had increased from three hundred in 1 7 1 5 to
eighteen hundred in 1 73s. 66</p>
<p>The rising profits from maritime commerce were the chief stimulus to
the conquest of colonies. The zeal of French merchants and missionaries
had won for France most of Canada and the Mississippi basin, and some
Caribbean isles. England challenged these French possessions as
enclosing and endangering its colonies in America; war would decide that
issue. A like rivalry divided the French and the English in India. At
Pondicherry, on the east coast south of Madras, the French had
established themselves in 1683, and in 1688 they received from the Mogul
Emperor full control of Chandernagor, north of Calcutta. Under the
energetic lead of Joseph Dupleix these two ports captured so much trade
and wealth that the English East India Company, which had set up
strongholds at Madras (1639), Bom- bay (1668), and Calcutta (1686), felt
itself compelled to fight the French for the disintegrating Mogul
realm.</p>
<p>When England and France found themselves on opposite sides in the War
of the Austrian Succession (1744), Mahe de La Bourdonnais, who had made
a record of enterprising administration in the French islands of
Mauritius and Bourbon in the Indian Ocean, proposed to the Versailles
gov- ernment a plan “to ruin the commerce and colonies of the English in
India.” 67 With a French squadron, and the jealous consent of Dupleix,
he attacked Madras and soon compelled its surrender (1746). On his
own</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>responsibility he signed an agreement with the English authorities to
restore Madras to them for an indemnity of .£420,000. Dupleix refused to
sanction this arrangement; La Bourdonnais persisted; he sailed on a
Dutch ship to Europe, was captured by an English ship, was released on
parole, entered Paris, and was sent to the Bastille on a charge of
insubordination and trea- son. He demanded trial; after two years of
imprisonment he was tried, and acquitted (1751); he died in 1753.
Meanwhile a powerful British fleet be- sieged Pondicherry (August,
1748); Dupleix defended it with such spirit and skill that the siege was
abandoned (October). Seven days later the news reached India that the
Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had returned Madras to England. The French
government, knowing that the inferiority of its navy doomed it to defeat
in India, refused to support Dupleix’s schemes of con - quest; it sent
him only minor forces and funds, and finally recalled him to France
(1754). He lived long enough to see the utter rout of the French by the
English in the India phase of the Seven Years’ War.</p>
<p>At the top of the Third Estate were the financiers. They could be
old- fashioned small-scale moneylenders, or full-scale bankers handling
deposits, loans, and investments, or “tax farmers” serving as revenue ag
ents for the state. The restrictions laid by the Catholic Church upon
the charging of in- terest had now very little effect; John Law found
half of France eager to trade in stocks and bonds. Paris opened its
Bourse in 1724.</p>
<p>Some financiers were richer than most nobles. Paris-Montmartel had
100 million livres, Lenormant de Tournehem 20 million, Samuel Bernard 33
million. 68 Bernard married his daughters into the aristocracy by giving
each of them a dowry of 800,000 livres. 69 He was a gentleman and a
patriot; in 1 7 1 5 he himself fixed the tax on his property at nine
million livres, so re- vealing a wealth that he might have partly
concealed; 70 and when he died (1739) the examination of his accounts
disclosed the great extent of his secret charities. 71 The four brothers
Paris developed their banking firm into a political power. Voltaire
learned from them much of his financial cunning, and shocked Europe by
being both a philosopher and a millionaire.</p>
<p>The best-hated financiers in eighteenth- century France were the
“farm - ers general.” The ferme generate had been organized in 1697 to
collect indi - rect taxes — chiefly on subsidies, registrations, drafts,
salt, and tobacco. In order to spend these revenues before they were
collected, the government farmed them out to some individual who paid it
a stipulated sum for the right to gather them over a period of six
years. The increase in taxes, wealth, and inflation is reflected in the
rising price paid for this lucrative lease: 80 mil- lion livres in 1726,
92 million in 1744, 152 million in 1774; no government has ever been at
a loss for ways to spend its people’s money. The lessee delegated the
collection of the taxes to forty or more “farmers general”</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>( fermiers generaux ), each of whom paid a million or more livres as
ad- vance security, and licked his fingers as the revenues passed
through them; so the profits of the forty farmers general for 1726-30
exceeded 156 million livres. 72 Many of such collectors bought estates
and titles, built costly palaces, and lived in a pompous luxury that
aroused the ire of aristocracy and clergy. Some of them collected art
and artists, poets and mistresses, and opened their homes as havens or
salons to the intelligentsia. Helvetius, most amiable of the
philosophes, was one of the most generous of the fermiers generaux.
Rousseau was long the guest of Mme. d’fipinay, a farmer gen - eral’s
wife; Rameau and Vanloo enjoyed the hospitality of Alexandre de La
Popeliniere, chief Maecenas among the financiers. The upper bourgeoisie,
anxious for social recognition, revenged themselves for ecclesiastical
cen- sures and titled contempt by supporting the philosophers against
the Church, and later against the nobility. Perhaps it was the
financiers who financed the Revolution.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>The middle classes were now powerful in the state, for they filled
all but those lofty ministries that needed the aura of a family tree.
They were the bureaucracy. Their wits having been sharpened by natural
selection in the economic arena, they proved more skillful and competent
than the un- prodded and lackadaisical scions of the vegetating
nobility. The noblesse de robe in the parlements and the magistracies
really belonged to the bour- geoisie in origin and character. The middle
class governed the communes, the forty provinces, the commissaries of
war, supplies, and communications, the care of mines, roads, streets,
bridges, rivers, canals, and ports. In the army the generals were
nobles, but they followed campaigns planned for them by middle-class
strategists in Paris. 73 The bourgeois form of the French state in the
nineteenth century was already prefigured in the eighteenth.</p>
<p>The administration of France was generally acknowledged to be the
best in Europe, but it had mortal defects. It was so centralized,
pervasive, and detailed that it checked local initiative and vitality,
and wasted much time in the transmission of orders and reports. Compared
with England, France was a stifling despotism. No meetings of the people
were permitted, no popular suffrage was taken except in minor local
affairs, no Parliament checked the king. Louis XV improved the
government by neglecting it, but he delegated to his ministers such
royal powers as the issuance of lettres de cachet, and this authority
was often abused. Sometimes, it is true, such “secret letters” served to
accelerate governmental action by evadi ng techni-</p>

<p>267</p>
<p>cal details of administrative procedure (“red tape”). One lettre de
cachet</p>
<p>French law was as retarded as French administration was advanced. It
varied from province to province, recalling their former isolation and
autonomy; there were 350 different bodies of law in different regions of
France. Colbert had made an unsuccessful attempt to systematize and
define French law in the Ordonnance Criminelle of 1670, but even his
code mingled confusedly medieval and modern, Germanic and Roman, canon
and civil legislation. New laws were made on the need of the moment by
the king, usually at the urging of his minis- ters, with only a hurried
inquiry into their consistency with existing laws. It was difficult for
the citizen to discover what the law was in his particular place and
case.</p>
<p>Criminal law was enforced in the counties by the marechaussee , or
mounted police, and in the larger cities by municipal police. Those in
Paris had been well organized and trained by Marc Rene de Voyer
d’Argenson, who not only fathered famous sons, but, as lieutenant
general of police from 1697 to 1718, earned the nickname “Damne” because
he looked like the Devil. In any case he was a terror to the criminals
of Paris, for he knew their haunts and ways; and yet (Saint- Simon
assures us) he “was full of humanity” 76 — a Joubert before Les
Miserables .</p>
<p>An arrested person was confined, before his trial, under conditions
hardly dif- ferent from those designed for punishment. He might, like
Jean Calas, spend months in chains and mental torture, in filth and
daily danger of disease. If he tried to escape his property was
confiscated. If charged with a major crime he was not allowed to
communicate with a lawyer. There was no right of habeas corpus, no trial
by jury. Witnesses were questioned separately and privately. If the
judge believed the suspected man guilty, but had insufficient evidence
to</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>convict him, he was authorized to use torture to elicit a confession.
Such judicial torture declined in frequency and severity under Louis XV,
but it remained a part of French legal procedure until 1780.</p>
<p>Penalties ranged from fines to dismemberment. The pillory was favored
for punishing dishonesty in business. Thieves and other petty criminals
were flogged as they were drawn at a cart-tail through the streets.
Theft by domestics might be punished with death, but employers rarely
invoked this law. Condemnation to the galleys was officially ended in
1748. Death was the statutory penalty for a great variety of offenses,
including sorcery, blasphemy, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality.
Decapitation and burning at the stake were no longer used, but execution
could be enhanced by “drawing and quartering” the condemned, or bv
breaking his limbs with an iron bar as he lay bound to a wheel. “A
capital execution,” we are told, “was always looked forward to with
delight by the people, especially in Paris.” 77</p>
<p>The judiciary was almost as complicated as the law. In the
countryside there were thousands of feudal courts administering local
law, and presided over by judges appointed by the proprietary seigneur;
these courts could deal only with petty cases, could impose no penalty
beyond a small fine, and were subject to appeal; but the peasant found
it difficult and expensive to win a suit against a lord. Above these
seignorial courts were those of the territorial b atilt and sene - chal.
Many towns had communal courts. Over all these lower tribunals were
presidial courts administering royal law. The king might appoint special
courts for special purposes. The Church tried its clergy by its own
canon law in ec- clesiastical courts. Lawyers swarmed in and around the
various courts, profiting from a French passion for litigation. Thirteen
major cities had parlements com- posed of judges acting as supreme
courts for these cities and their environs; the Paris Parlement so
served nearly a third of France. Each parlement claimed that until it
had passed upon, accepted, and registered it, no edict of king or
govern- ment became law. The royal Council of State never admitted this
claim, but often allowed the parlements the right of remonstrance. The
drearier part of French history revolved around these contested claims
of parlements and king.</p>
<p>Between the Paris Parlement and the king stood the ministries and the
court. All the ministers to gether constituted the Conseil d’£tat, or
Council of State. The court consisted of the ministers plus those nobles
or clergy- men or distinguished commoners who had been presented to the
king, plus the aides and servants of these courtiers. Strict protocol
marked out each courtier’s status, qualifications, precedence,
privileges, and duties, and an elaborate and detailed code of etiquette
eased the friction and burdened the lives of several hundred proud and
jealous individuals. Lavish ceremonies alleviated the monotony of court
routine, and provided the mystic am- bience indispensable to royal
government. The favorite amusements at court were gossip, eating,
gambling, hunting, and adultery. “In France,”</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>reported the Neapolitan ambassador, “nine tenths of the people die of
hunger, one tenth of indigestion.” 78 Enormous sums were lost and won at
play. To pay their debts courtiers sold their influence to the highest
bidder; no one could obtain an office or a perquisite without a
substantial fee to some member of the court. Nearly every husband at
court had a mistress, and nearly every wife a lover. No one grudged the
King his concubines; the nobles merely complained that in Mme. de
Pompadour he had taken a com- moner to his bed when they would have felt
honored to have him deflower their daughters.</p>
<p>Though Louis XV had officially come of age in 1723, he was then only
thirteen years old, and he turned over the administration to Louis
Henri, Due de Bourbon. The Comte de Toulouse, legitimized offspring of
Louis XIV, had been considered for the post, but had been rejected as
“too honest to make a good minister.” 79 “Monsieur le Due” himself was a
man of good will. He did his best to alleviate the poverty of the
people; he thought to do this by an officially fixed scale of prices and
wages, but the law of supply and demand defeated his hopes. He dared to
lay an income tax of two per cent upon all classes; the clergy
protested, and conspired for his fall. 80 He allowed too much influence
to his mistress, the Marquise de Prie. She was clever, but her
intelligence fell short of her beauty. She maneuvered the marriage of
Louis XV to Marie Leszczynska, hoping to keep the young Queen in
tutelage; however, Marie soon lost her influence. Mme. de Prie favored
Voltaire, alienated the clergy, and led the Duke to attack the episcopal
tutor who had recommended him to the King as chief minister. But the
King admired and trusted his tutor beyond any other man in the
state.</p>
<p>Andre Hercule de Fleury had been made bishop of Frejus in 1698, royal
tutor in 1715. Soon he gained a dominant influence over the boy’s mind.
The bishop was tall, handsome, pliant, gracious; a bit lazy, and never
push- ing his fortune, but he arrived. Michelet and Sainte-Beuve
believed that Fleury, as preceptor, had weakened the young monarch’s
character with carefree indulgence, and had trained him to favor the
Jesuits; 81 but Voltaire, no friend of the clergy, thought highly of
Fleury both as tutor and as minister:</p>
<p>Fleury applied himself to mold the mind of his pupil to business,</p>
<p>secrecy, and probity, and preserved, amid the hurry and agitation of
the court, during the minority 〔of the King〕, the good graces of
the</p>
<p>Regent and the esteem of the public. He never made a merit of his own
services, nor complained of others, and never engaged in cabals or in-
trigues of the court. . . . He privately endeavored to make himself ac-
quainted with the affairs of the kingdom at home, and its interests</p>
<p>1-jo</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>abroad. In a word, the circumspection of his conduct and the amiabil-
ity of his disposition made all France wish to see him at the head of
the administration. 82</p>
<p>When Fleury learned that his continuing influence in the
determination of policy had provoked the Due de Bourbon to recommend his
dismissal from the court, he made no attempt to maintain his place, but
quietly with- drew to the monastery of the Sulpicians at Issy, a suburb
of Paris (Decem- ber 1 8, 1725). The King ordered the Duke to ask Fleury
to return. Fleury did. On June 1 1 Louis XV, responding to the evident
desire of the court, the clergy, and the public, 83 abruptly commanded
Bourbon “to retire to Chantilly and remain there till further orders.”
Mme. de Prie was banished to her chateau in Normandy, where, bored to
death, she poisoned herself ( 1 7 2 7 ) ♦</p>
<p>Fleury, still advancing by retreating, took no official position; on
the contrary he persuaded the King to declare that henceforth he himself
would rule. But Louis preferred to hunt or gamble, and Fleury became
prime minister in all but name (June 1 1, 1726). He was now
seventy-three years old. Many ambitious souls looked for his early
death, but he ruled France for seventeen years.</p>
<p>He did not forget that he was a priest. On October 8 he revoked the
two per cent tax so far as it concerned the clergy; they responded with
a don gratuit of five million livres to the state. Fleury asked their
support to his request for a cardinal’s hat, which he needed for
precedence over the dukes in the Council of State; it was given him
(November 5), and now he made no effort to conceal the fact that he was
ruling France.</p>
<p>He astonished the court by remaining as modest in power as he had
been in preparation. He lived with an almost parsimonious simplicity,
satis - fied with the reality, without the appurtenances, of power. “His
exaltation,”</p>
<p>He attended in his leisurely way not only to the formation of policy
but to the administration of the government. He chose his aides with
discerning judgment, and managed them with both firmness and courtesy.
Under him Henri Francis d’Aguessau continued with his long task (1727
-51) of re- forming and codifying the law, and Philibert Orry restored
order and sta-</p>

<p>bility to the finances of the state. Avoiding war until he was forced
to it by the dynastic ambitions of the ruling family, Fleury gave France
long</p>
<p>periods of peace that allowed her to reinvigorate her economic life.
His suc- cess seemed to justify in advance the arguments soon to be
voiced by the physiocrats, that to govern little is to govern well. He
promised to halt inflation, and kept his word. Internal and foreign
commerce expanded rapidly; revenues rose. Spending the revenues with
resolute economy, checking the cost of court festivities, he was able to
remove from all classes (1727) the two per cent income tax, and to lower
the taille that fell so heavily upon the peasantry. He returned to the
cities and towns the right to elect their own officials. Under the
example of his personal rectitude the morals of the court reluctantly
improved.</p>
<p>Against these credits some major debits raise their heads. He allowed
the farmers general to continue their collection of taxes without
ministerial interference. To further the vast plan of road building
conceived by the intendants he established the corvee that put the
peasants to work with no reward but food. He founded military schools
for the sons of the aristoc- racy, but he economized imprudently by
neglecting the repair and exten- sion of the navy; soon French commerce
and colonies were at the mercy of English fleets. He trusted too fondly
to his ability to keep the peace with England.</p>
<p>So long as Robert Walpole rul ed England, the Cardinal’s pacific
policy prospered. The two men, though poles apart in morals and
character, agreed on the desirability of peace. In 1733, however, his
advisers on foreign af- fairs persuaded him into a halfhearted attempt
to replace th e King’s father - in-law, Stanislas Leszczynski, upon the
throne of Poland. But Leszczynski proposed to reform the Polish
constitution and set up a strong government; Russia and Austria
preferred a Poland hamstrung by the liberum veto; in the War of the
Polish Succession (1733-38) they chased Leszczynski from Warsaw and then
from Danzig; Fleury, averse to a major conflict, advised Stanislas to
retire to Nancy and Luneville as titular “king of Lorraine.” It was not
all a disaster; Leszczynski and the Powers agreed that on his death
Lorraine, which was predominantly French, should revert to France. It so
transpired in 1766.</p>
<p>Fleury, eighty-eight years old, strove with all his waning energy to
keep France out of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740). A woman
over- ruled him. Felicite de Nesle, Marquise de Vintimille, who for the
time be- ing was sharing the King’s bed, listened in rapture to Charles
Auguste Fou - quet, Comte de Belle-Isle, grandson of the artistic
embezzler, Nicolas Fouquet, whom Louis XIV had so profitably deposed.
Belle-Isle told her that Fleury was an old fool; that now, when
Frederick II of Prussia was attack- ing the young Maria Theresa of
Austria, a golden opportunity had come for</p>
<p>2 7 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>dismembering her empire; France must join Frederick and share the
spoils. The charming mistress sang these strains to her royal lover; she
urged him to take the reins from the Cardinal’s timid hands, and make
France glorious again. Fleury pleaded with him that both honor and
interest forbade Belle- Isle’s scheme; England would not let Austria be
destroyed to make France</p>
<p>After a year of war the shifty Frederick, deserting France, signed a
secret truce with Austria. The Austrian armies, so released, moved into
Bohemia and began to encircle Prague; it was only a matter of time
before Belle-Isle and his twenty thousand men, already harassed by a
hostile population, would be compelled to surrender. On July 11, 1742,
Fleury sent to the Austrian commander, Count von Konigsegg, a
humiliating appeal for mild terms to the French garrison. “Many people
know,” he wrote, “how op - posed I was to the resolutions we took, and
that I was in a way forced to consent.” 88 Konigseg g sent the letter to
Maria Theresa, who at once gave it to the world. A French army was sent
to rescue Belle-Isle; it never reached him. In December Belle-Isle,
leaving six thousand sick or wounded men behind, led his main force out
of Prague to the frontier at Eger; but the flight took place in wintry
weather over a hundred miles of mountainous or marshy terrain covered
with snow or ice and infested with enemy raiders; of the fourteen
thousand men who began that march twelve hundred died on the way. France
applauded the brilliant salvage of a humiliating reverse. Fleury gave up
his ministry, retired to Issy, and died (January 29, 1743), ninety years
old.</p>
<p>The King announced that henceforth he would be his own prime min-
ister.</p>
<p>V. LOUIS XV</p>
<p>How does it feel to be king from the age of five? The boy who was
des- tined to rule France for fifty-nine years was hardly noticed in his
early childhood; he was weak, and was expected to die soon. Then
suddenly, in 1712, both his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy,
were carried off by smallpox, and the boy was heir to the throne. Three
years later he was king.</p>
<p>Every precaution was taken to unfit him for rule. His governess, Mme.
de Ventadour, worried tremulously about the boy’s health, and shielded
him from any hardening weather. A Jesuit confessor infused into him an
awe- some reverence for the Church. Fleury, as tutor, was complaisant
and in-</p>

<p>*73</p>
<p>dulgent, and seems to have thought that it would be a blessing for
France to have a do- nothing king. The lad’s governor, Marechal de
Villeroi, ad - ministered an opposite poison: leading him to a window of
the Tuileries to receive the plaudits of a multi tude gathered to
acclaim him, “Look, mon maitre he said, “all that crowd, all those
people, are yours; all belong to you; you are their master.” 89
Omnipotence married incompetence.</p>
<p>Spoiled by adoration, selfish in power, lazy and willful, Louis
developed into a bored and taciturn youth, forgivably shunning the
surveillance of his guardians — and later the ceremonies and servility
of the court — to seek an outlet in wood carving, needlework, milking
cows, playing with dogs. 90 The elements of cruelty that lurk in all of
us were allowed in him to come through his timidity to the surface; it
is related that in his boyhood he took pleasure in hurting, even
killing, animals. 91 In mature years he sublimated this into hunting,
but it may have entered into his callous use and quick dis- carding of
the young women trained in the Parc aux Cerfs for a stay in his bed. And
yet a certain shy sensitivity and considerateness marked his treat- ment
of his friends.</p>
<p>He had a good mind, which might have excelled if supported by charac-
ter. He astonished all by his retentive memory and ready wit. He
naturally preferred games to study, but he absorbed some real
instruction in Latin, mathematics, history, botany, and military arts.
He grew up to be tall, slender but broad-shouldered, with fine
complexion and curly golden hair; Marechal de Richelieu called him “the
handsomest lad in his dominions.” 92 The museum at Versailles preserves
Vanloo’s portrait of him at thirteen, with sword and armor hardly
befitting the boyish face. Rene Louis d’Ar - genson compared him to
Eros. Women fell in love with him at first sight. When he took sick
(1722), all France prayed for him; when he recovered, France wept with
joy. This people which had suffered so much from its kings rejoiced in
the hope that soon the youth would marry and beget a son to continue his
noble house.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had already been affianced (1721), aged eleven, to Marfa
Ana Victoria, aged two, daughter of Philip V of Spain; she had been
delivered to Paris, and was now waiting for nubility. But Mme. de Prie
thought she could ensure her continuing influence by having this
tentative union an- nulled, and marrying Louis to Marie Leszczynska,
daughter of the deposed King of Poland. She had her way. The Infanta was
sent back to Spain (1725) — an insult never forgiven by the Spanish
court. Stanislas was in refuge at Wissembourg in Alsace when he received
the French King’s re - quest for his daughter’s hand. Entering th e room
where she and her mother were at work, he said, “Let us fall on our
knees and thank God.” “My dear father,” exclaimed Marie joyfully, “are
you recalled to the throne of Po - land?” “God has done us a more
astounding grace,” Stanislas replied; “you</p>
<p>2 74</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>are made Queen of France.” 93 Marie had never dreamed of elevation to
the greatest throne in Europe; she had seen pictures of Louis XV as of
someone unattainably exalted, handsome, and powerful. The French
treasury sent her dresses, petticoats, shoes, gloves, jewelry; it
promised her 250,000 livres upon her reaching Versailles, and a life
annuity of twenty thousand gold crowns. She took it all in a daze, and
thanked God for her good fortune. She was married to the King by proxy
at Strasbourg (August 15, 1725); she went merrily through days of
tribulation on storm-drenched roads to Paris; she was married to the
King in person at Fontainebleau on Septem- ber 5. He was fifteen, she
was twenty-two. She was not beautiful, she was only good.</p>
<p>Louis, who had as yet shown no interest in women, awoke at the touch
of his modest bride. He embraced her with an ardor that surprised his
en- tourage; and for some time their life was an idyl of love and
happiness. She won the respect and loyalty of the people, but she was
never popular. She was kind, affectionate, tender, and not lacking in
playful wit; nevertheless Versailles missed in her the alert mind and
vivacious speech that had become obligatory in ladies of the court. She
was shocked by the morals of the aristocracy, but she made no other
criticism than to give an example of a faithful wife, eager to please
her husband and to give him an heir. In twelve years she bore ten
children, and in her off years she suffered miscarriages. The royal
appetite became a problem for the Queen; she begged the King to be
continent at least on the festivals of the major saints. Then, through
her labors and duties, she developed a scrofulous fistula, and the
King’s ardor sought other channels. Her gratitude to Mme. de Prie and
the Due de Bourbon was a misfortune; she listened too patiently when, in
the royal presence, the Duke denounced Fleury; when Fleury came to power
he sent her daughters to a distant convent on grounds of economy, and
his con- tinuing influence weighted the scales against her. As the King
grew colder she retired to an inner circle of her friends, played cards,
wove tapestry, tried painting, and found solace in practices of piety
and charity. “She lived a convent life amid the fevers and frivolities
of the court.” 94</p>
<p>The King had to be amused, and Mme. de Prie had chosen for him an
unamusing wife. But not until seven years after his marriage did he take
a mistress; then he took four in succession, yet with a certain
fidelity, for they were all sisters. None was very comely, but all were
lively and amusing, and all but one were experts in coquetry. Louise de
Nesle, Comtesse de Mailly, had the honor of being apparently the first
to seduce the King (1732). Like Louise de La Valliere, she sincerely
loved her royal master; she sought neither riches nor power, but only to
make him happy. When her sister Felicite, fre sh from a convent,
competed for the King’s bed, Louise shared Louis with her (1739) in a
heterodox menage a quatre — for he still visited</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl)</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>the Queen. The complication troubled the conscience of the King; for
a time he avoided the Eucharist, having heard terrible stories of men
who had dropped dead on taking the Host into a sinful mouth. 95 This
second siren, according to one of her sisters , “had the figure of a
grenadier, the neck of a crane, and the smell of a monkey”; 96 she
managed nevertheless to become pregnant. To preserve the proprieties
Louis found a husband for her, mak- ing her the Marquise de Vintimille.
In 1740 Mme. de Mailly withdrew to a convent; she left it a year later
to tend her victorious rival, who was dying in childbirth (1741). The
King wept, Mme. de Mailly wept with him; he found comfort in her arms;
she became mistress again.</p>
<p>A third sister, Adelaide de Nesle, fat and ugly, was clever and
witty; she amused the King with her mimicry and repartee; he enjoyed
her, found a husband for her, and passed on. A fourth sister, Mme. de
Flavacourt, re- sisted him and befriended the Queen. But a fifth sister,
ablest of them all, Marie Anne de Nesle de La Tournelle, persuaded Mme.
de Mailly to pre- sent her to the King. She not only conquered him ( 1
742 ) , but insisted on being sole mistress; the amiable Mailly was sent
away penniless, falling in a day from royalty to piety; so one Nesle
drove out another. Some time later she had to disturb a number of
worshipers to reach her chair in Notre- Dame. One of these muttered, “A
lot of fuss over a whore.” “Sir,” she said, “since you know me so well,
grant me the favor of praying God for me.” 97 God must have found it
easy to forgive her.</p>
<p>The new Nesle was the most beautiful of the sorority. Nattier’ s
portrait</p>
<p>A strong faction at court favored her, for it hoped to use her
influence in winning the King to an active martial policy, in which the
primacy of government would return from the bourgeois bureaucracy to the
military nobility. Louis at times labored dutifully in council with his
ministers; he more often delegated his authority and tasks to them,
seldom met with them, rarely contradicted them, occasionally signed
conflicting decrees pro- posed by rival aides with conflicting policies.
He fled from the irksome etiquette of the court to his dogs, his horses,
and the hunt; when he did not hunt the court said, “Today the King does
nothing.” Though he did not lack courage, he had no taste for war; he
preferred a bed to a trench.</p>
<p>In bed and boudoir his voluptuous Duchess, reviving Agnes Sorel,
urged him to play an active part in war against England and Austria. She
pictured Louis XIV leading his army to glory at Mons and Namur, and
asked why</p>
<p>2j6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>Louis XV , as handsome and brave as his great-grandfather, should not
like- wise shine in armor at the head of his troops. She had her way,
and died in victory. For a moment the roi faineant awoke from his
lethargy. Perhaps it was at her prompting that when the end had come at
last to the pacific Fleury, Louis announced that he would rule as well
as reign. On April 26, *744&gt; France resumed active war against
Austria; on May 22 alliance was renewed with Frederick of Prussia, who
sent his thanks to Mme. de Cha- teauroux. Louis proceeded in royal
fanfare to the front, followed a day later by his mistress and other
ladies of the court, all attended by their wonted luxuries. The main
French army, led by the King but directed in tactics by Adrien Maurice
de Noailles and Maurice de Saxe, won easy victories at Courtrai, Menin,
Ypres, and Furnes. Louis XIV and the grand siecle seemed reborn.</p>
<p>Amid the festivities word came that a French force, badly supported
by its Bavarian allies, had allowed an Austro-Hungarian army to occupy
parts of Alsace and Lorraine; Stanislas, never rid of misfortune, had to
flee from Luneville. Louis left Flanders and hurried to Metz, hoping to
inspire the defeated army by his presence. But there, as the result of
unwonted excite- ment, varied labors, indigestion, and midsummer heat,
he fell seriously sick, and worsened so rapidly that by August 1 1 he
was thought to be in danger of death. His mistress had followed him, and
now superintended his care; the bishop of Soissons refused to allow him
the last sacrament until the Duchess had been dismissed; Louis yielded
and banished her to 150 miles from the court (August 14, 1744). The
populace hooted her as she left the city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Marie Leszczynska had traveled in haste across France to be
at the bedside of her husband; en route her cortege met the carriages of
Chateauroux and her party. T he King embraced the Queen, and said, “I
have caused you much sorrow, which you do not deserve; I beg you to for-
give me for it.” She answered, “Do you not know that you never need
pardon from me? God alone has been offended.” When the King began to m
end she wrote to Mme. de Maurepas that she was “the happiest of
mortals.” All France went wild with joy at the King’s recovery and re -
pentance; in Paris the citizens embraced one another in the streets;
some embraced the horse of the courier who had brought the good news. A
poet called the King “Louis le Bien - Aime,” Louis the Well Beloved; the
nation echoed the phrase. Louis, hearing of it, wondered, “What have I
done to make them love me so much?” 98 He had served as a father image
for his people.</p>
<p>Frederick saved Alsace for France by invading Bohemia; the
Austro-</p>
<p>Hungarian army left Alsace to rescue Prague. Louis, still weak,
joined his army advancing into Germany, and saw it take
Freiburg-im-Breisgau. In</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 277</p>
<p>November he returned to Versailles. He recalled Mme. de Chateauroux
to favor, and exiled the bishop of Soissons; but on December 8, after
many days of fever and delirium, the mistress died. She was buried at
night to spare her corpse the insults of the crowd. Resentful of the
clergy, the King avoided the sacraments at Christmas, and waited for
another love.</p>
<p>For a time the nation forgot the sins of Le Bien-Aime in the triumphs
of its army, and a German Protestant general was the hero of France.
Maurice de Saxe was the son of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony
and King of Poland. His mother was the Countess Maria Aurora von
Konigsmarck, distinguished among that monarch’s mistresses for such
beauty and wit that</p>
<p>Despicable in morals, using one woman after another without returning
their devotion, he became on the battlefield an incomparable genius of
strategy, bold in conception, alert to every danger and opportunity.
Fred- erick the Great, his only rival in that age, said of him that he
“could give lessons to any general in Europe.” 100 In the spring of
1745, having been appointed commander in chief of the French army, he
was ordered to the front. He was near death in Paris at the time,
exhausted with excesses and suffering agonies from dropsy. Voltaire
asked him how, in such a condition, he could think of taking the fi eld.
Maurice replied, “II ne s’agit pas de vivre, mais de partir” (The
important point is not to live but to set out). 101 On May ii, with
52,000 men, he fought the English and the Dutch, 46,000 strong, at
Fontenoy. Louis XV and the Dauphin watched the famous battle from a
nearby hill. Maurice, too dropsical to ride a horse, directed the

<p>tion from a wicker chair. Voltaire tells us, in what may have
developed as a patriotic legend, 102 that when the hostile masses of
infantry came face to face within musket range, Lord Charles Hay,
captain of the English Guards, called out, “Gentlemen of the French
Guards, give fire,” and that the Comte d’Antroche replied for the
French, “Gentlemen, we never fire first; d o you begin.” 103 Courtesy or
stratagem, it was costly; nine officers and 434 foot men were killed,
thirty officers and 430 soldiers were</p>
<p>wounded, by that first volley; 104 the French infantry faltered,
turned, and fled. Maurice sent word to the King to withdraw; Louis
refused, even when the retreating soldiers reached him; and perhaps his
resolution shamed them. Then Maurice mounted a horse, reordered his
forces, and let loose upon the enemy the “Maison du Roi,” the household
troops of the King. Seeing their King in danger of capture or death, and
inspired by the reck- less ubiquity of Marechal de Saxe under fire, the
French renewed the bat- tle; nobles and commoners on both sides became
heroes in the anesthesia of fury and glory; finally the English fell
back in disorder, and Maurice sent word to the King that the bitter
engagement had been won. The English and Dutch had lost 7,500 men, the
French 7,200. Louis bent his head in shame as the survivors cheered him.
“See, my son,” he told the Dauphin, “what a victory costs. Learn to be
chary of the blood of your subjects.” 105 While the King and his
entourage returned to Versailles, Maurice went on to take Ghent, Bruges,
Audenaarde, Ostend, Brussels; for a time all Flanders was French.</p>
<p>Frederick canceled the results of Fontenoy by signing a separate
peace with Austria (December, 1745); France was left to fight alone on
half a dozen fronts from Flanders to Italy. By the Treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle</p>

<li>she relinquished Flanders, and had to be content with obtaining the
duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla for Louis’ new son -in-law,
the Infante Don Felipe of Spain. Maurice of Saxony lived on till 1750,
loaded with riches, honors, and disease, and finding time, between
mistresses, to write some philosophical Reveries:</li>
</ol>
<p>What a spectacle is presented today by the nations! We see some</p>
<p>men living in leisure, pleasure, and wealth at the expense of the
multi- tude, which can subsist only by providing ever new pleasures for
these few. This assemblage of oppressors and oppressed constitutes what
we call a society. 106</p>
<p>Another of the exalted few dared dream of a kindlier regime. Rene
Louis de Voyer, Marquis d ’Argenson, who for three years (1744 -47)
served Louis XV as minister of foreign affairs, composed in 1739, but
dared not publish, Considerations sur le gouvernement de la France
(1765). Those who till the land, he wrote, are the most valuable part of
the population,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 279</p>
<p>and should be freed from all feudal dues and obligations; indeed, the
state should lend money to small farmers to help them finance their
future crops. 107 Trade is vital to a nation’s prosperit y and should be
freed from all internal tolls, even, wherever possible, from all import
or export dues. Nobles are the least precious element in the state; they
are incompetent as administrators, and in the economy they are the
drones of the hive; they should abdicate. “If anyone should say that
these principles favor democ - racy and look to the destruction of the
nobility, he would not be mistaken.” Legislation should aim at the
greatest possible equality. The communes should be governed by locally
elected officials, but the central and absolute power should reside in a
king, for only an absolute monarchy can protect the people from
oppression by the strong. 108 D’Argenson anticipated the philosophes in
hoping for reform through an enlightened king, and told the nobility
what it recognized only on August 4, 1789, when it surrendered its
feudal privileges. He was a stage on the way of France to Rousseau and
Revolution.</p>
<p>In 1 747 Louis yielded to the urging of Noailles, Maurepas, and
Pompa- dour, and dismissed d’Argenson. The Marquis lost his faith in
kings. In 1753 he predicted 1789:</p>
<p>The evil resulting from our absolute monarchical government is per-
suading all France and all Europe that it is the worst of
governments.</p>
<p>. . . This opinion advances, rises, grows stronger, and may lead to
na- tional revolution. . . . Everything is preparing the way for civil
war.</p>
<p>. . . The minds of men are turning to discontent and
disobedience,</p>
<p>and everything seems moving toward a great revolution, in both re-
ligion and government. 109</p>
<p>Or, as the King’s new mistress was to put it, “Apres moi le
deluge.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MME. DE POMPADOUR</li>
</ol>
<p>She was one of the most remarkable women in history, dowered with
such beauty and grace as blinded most men to her sins, and yet with such
powers of mind that for a brilliant decade she governed France,
protected Voltaire, saved Diderot’s Encyclopedic, and led the
philosophes to claim her as one of their own. It is difficult to look at
Boucher’s portrait of her (in the Wallace Collection) without losing the
impartiality of the historian in the infatuation of the man. Was she one
of nature’s masterpieces— or just one of Boucher’s?</p>
<p>She was already thirty-eight when he painted her, and her fragile
health was failing. He did not debase her with the superficial
sensuality of his rosy nudes. Instead he pictured the classic features
of her face, the grace of her figure, the artistry of her dress, the
smooth delicacy of her hands, the</p>
<p>28 o</p>

<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>“pompadour” of her light -brown hair. Perhaps he enhanced these
charms by his imagination and skill, but even he did not transmit her
gay laughter and gentle spirit, much less her subtle and penetrating
intelligence, her quiet force of character, the tenacity of her
sometimes ruthless will.</p>
<p>She had been beautiful almost from her birth. But she had not chosen
her parents well, and she had to struggle throughout her life against
aristocratic scorn of her middle-class origin. Her father was a
provision merchant, Frangois Poisson, who could never live down his name
— Mr. Fish. Accused of malversation, he was sentenced to be hanged; he
fled to Hamburg, ma- neuvered a pardon, and returned to Paris (1741).
The mother, a daughter of the entrepreneur des provisions des Invalides,
engaged in gallantries while her husband languished in Hamburg; she
enjoyed a long liaison with a rich farmer general, Charles Frangois
Lenormant de Tournehem, who paid for the education of the pretty girl
born to Mme. Poisson in 1721.</p>
<p>Jeanne Antoinette Poisson had the best available tutors — Jelyotte,
the great baritone, for singing, Crebillon pere for elocution; in time
she rivaled the stars of the stage in singing, dancing, and acting; “her
voice in itself was a seduction.” 110 She learned to draw and engrave,
and played the harpsi - chord well enough to win the enthusiastic praise
of Mme. de Mailly. When Jeanne was nine an old woman (whom she later
rewarded for prescience) predicted that she woul d someday be “a
mistress to the King.” 111 At fifteen her beauty and accomplishments
were such that her mother called her “un morceau de roi,” a morsel for a
king, and thought it would be a pity not to make her a queen. 112 But
the royal tidbit had already begun to cough blood. When she was twenty
M. de Tournehem persuaded her to marry his nephew, Charles Guillaume
Lenormant d’Ltioles, son of the treasurer of the mint. The husband fell
in love with his wife, and displayed her proudly in the salons. At Mme.
de Tencin’s she met Montesquieu, Fontenelle, Du - clos, Marivaux, and
added the art of conversation to her other charms. Soon she herself was
entertaining, with Fontenelle, Montesquieu, and Voltaire on her line.
She was happy, bore two children, and vowed that “no one in the world
but the King himself would make her unfaithful to her hus- band.” 113
What foresight!</p>
<p>Her mother thought that the exception could be arranged. She saw to
it that Jeanne should go riding in a handsome phaeton in the Senart
woods, where Louis hunted. Repeatedly he saw her unforgettable face. The
royal valets were bribed to praise her beauty to the King. On February
28, 1745, she attended a masked ball given in the Hotel de Ville for the
marriage of the Dauphin. She spoke to the King; he asked her to remove
her mask for a moment; she did, and danced away. In April he saw her at
a comedy played by an Italian troupe at Versailles. A few days later he
sent her an invitation to supper. “Amuse him,” her mother advised.

<p>Louis with surrender. He offered her an apartment at Versailles; she
ac- cepted. M. de Tournehem urged the husband to take the matter
philosophi- cally: “Do not incur ridicule by growing angry like a
bourgeois, or by</p>
<p>making a scene .” 114 The King made M. d’Ltioles a farmer general; he
re - signed himself to be a tax collector. The mother rejoiced in her
daughter’s elevation, and died. In September Jeanne received a handsome
property, became the Marquise de Pompadour, and was presented as such to
the court and the Queen, whom she mollified with a modest confusion. The
Queen forgave her as a necessary evil, and invited her to dinner. The
Dauphin, however, called her “Madame Whore.” The court resented the
intrusion of a bourgeoise into the King’s bed and purse, and did not
fail to notice her occasional relapses into middle-class words and ways.
Paris en- joyed epigrams and lampoons about “the King’s grisette.” She
suffered her unpopularity in silence until she could consolidate her
victory.</p>
<p>Seeing in Louis a god of boredom, to whom, having everything, every-
thing had lost its savor, she made herself the genius of entertainment.
She diverted him with dances, comedies, concerts, operas, supper
parties, ex- cursions, hunts; and in the intervals she delighted him
with her vivacity, her intelligent conversation, and her wit. She set up
the “Theatre des Petits Appartements” at Versailles, and persuaded the
court, as in the days of Louis XIV, to take parts on the stage; she
herself acted in Moliere’s come - dies, and so well that the King
pronounced her “the most char ming woman in France .” 115 Soon the
nobles competed for roles; the dour Dauphin him - self accepted a part
opposite “Madame Whore,” and condescended to be courteous to her in the
world of make-believe. When the King fell into religious moods she
soothed him with religious music, which she sang so entrancingly that he
forgot his fear of hell. He became dependent upon her for his interest
in life; he ate with her, played, danced, drove, hunted with her, spent
nearly every night with her. Within a few years she was physi- cally
exhausted.</p>
<p>The court complained that she distracted the King from his duties as
a ruler, and that she was a heavy burden on the revenues. She adorned
her figure with the most costly costumes and gems. Her boudoir sparkled
with toiletware of crystal, silver, and gold. Her rooms were embellished
with lacquered or satinwood or buhlwork furniture, and the choicest
potteries of Dresden, Sevres, China, and Japan; they were lighted with
stately chan- deliers of silver and glass, which were reflected in great
mirrors on the walls; the ceilings were painted by Boucher and Vanloo
with voluptuous goddesses of love. Feeling imprisoned even amid this
luxury, she drew im- mense sums from the King or the treasury to build
or furnish palaces, whose lavish equipment and extensive gardens she
excused as required for enter- taining majesty. She had an estate and
the Maison Crecy at Dreux; she</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VII</p>
<p>raised the sumptuous Chateau de Bellevue on the banks of the Seine
be- tween Sevres and Meudon; she put up pretty “hermitages” in the woods
of Versailles, Fontainebleau, and Compiegne. She took over the Hotel de
Pontchartrain as her Paris residence, and then moved to the palace of
the Comte d’Lvreux in the Rue du Faubourg St. -Honore. Altogether
the</p>
<p>charming lady seems to have spent 36,327,268 livres, 116 part of
which took the form of art that remained in the possession of France.
Her household expenses ran to 33,000 livres per year. 117 France
condemned her as costing more than a war.</p>
<p>She gathered power as well as wealth. She became the main channel
through which appointments, pensions, pardons, and other blessings
flowed from the King. She secured gifts, titles, sinecures for her
relatives. For her little daughter, Alexandrine, whom she called
“Fanfan,” she judged nothing too good; she dreamed of marrying her to a
son of Louis XV by Mme. de Vintimille; but Fanfan died a t nine,
breaking Pompadour’s heart. Her brother Abel, handsome and
well-mannered, earned his own favor with the King, who called him
petit-frere, brother-in-law, and often invited him to supper. Pompadour
made him Marquis de Marigny, and appointed him directeur general des
bdtiments — commissioner of buildings. He performed his functions with
such industry and competence that nearly everyone was pleased. Pompadour
offered to make him a duke; he refused.</p>
<p>Partly through him, but much more in her own person, she had a per-
vasive influence upon French — even European — art. She failed in her
efforts to be an artist herself, but she loved art with a sincere
devotion, and every- thing that she touched took on beauty. The minor
arts smiled bewitchingly under her encouragement. She convinced Louis XV
that France could make her own porcelain, instead of importing it from
China and Dresden at a cost of 500,000 livres per year. She persevered
until the government under- took to finance the porcelain works at
Sevres. Furniture, dinner services, clocks, fans, couches, vases,
bottles, boxes, cameos, mirrors, assumed a fra- gile loveliness to meet
her refined and exacting taste; she became the Queen of Rococo. 118 Much
of her extravagant expenditure went to support paint- ers, sculptors,
engravers, cabinetmakers, and architects. She gave commis- sions to
Boucher, Oudry, La Tour, and a hundred other artists. She inspired
Vanloo and Chardin to paint scenes of common life, ending the hackneyed
repetition of subjects from ancient or medieval legend or history. She
bore with smiling tolerance the grumblings and insolence of La Tour when
he came to paint her portrait. Her name was given to fans, hairdos,
dresses, dishes, sofas, beds, chairs, rib bons, and the “Pompadour rose”
of her favored porcelain. Now, rather than under Louis XIV, the
influence of France upon European civilization reached its highest
point.</p>
<p>She was probably the most cultured woman of her time. She had a
library</p>
<p>CHAP. VIl) THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE 283</p>
<p>of 3,500 volumes, 738 of them on history, 215 on philosophy, many on
art, some on politics or law, several romances of love. Apparently,
besides amus- ing the King, fending off her enemies, and helping to
govern France, she found time to read good books, for she herself wrote
excellent French, in letters rich in substance as well as charm. She
begged her lover to rival his great-grandfather in the patronage of
literature, but his piety and parsi- mony held him back. When she tried
to shame him by noting that Fred- erick the Great had given d’Alembert a
pension of twelve hundred livres, he answered, “There are so many more
beaux -esprits . . . here than in Prussia, I should be forced to have a
very large dinner table to assemble them all”; and he began to count
them on his fingers— “Maupertuis, Fon - tenelle, Lamotte, Voltaire,
Freron, Piron, Destouches, Montesquieu, Cardi- nal de Polignac.” People
around him added, “D’Alembert, Clairaut, Crebil - lon fils, Prevost . .
.” “Well,” sighed the King, “for twenty -five years all that might have
been dining or supping with me!” 119</p>
<p>So Pompadour took his place as patron. She brought Voltaire to court,
gave him commissions, tried to protect him from his faux-pas. She helped
Montesquieu, Marmontel, Duclos, Buff on, Rousseau; she eased Voltaire
and Duclos into the French Academy. When she heard that Crebillon pere
was living in poverty she secured a pension for him, gave him an
apartment in the Louvre, supported a revival of his Catilina, and had
the royal printing office issue an elegant edition of the old man’s
plays. She chose as her per - sonal physician Francois Quesnay,
protagonist of the physiocrats, and as- signed him a suite of rooms
directly under her own at Versailles. There she entertained Diderot,
d’Alembert, Duclos, Helvetius, Turgot, and others whose ideas would have
startled the King; and (Marmontel reports) “not being able to invite
that group of philosophers to her salon, she would come down herself to
see them at table and talk with them.” 120</p>
<p>Naturally the clergy, and the party of the devots at court, led by
the Dauphin, looked with shocked consternation at this coddling of
infidels. Moreover, Pompadour was known to favor the taxation of
ecclesiastical property, even its secularization, if this should prove
the only escape from the bankruptcy of the state. 121 The Jesuits
advised the King’s confessor to refuse him the sacraments so long as he
kept this dangerous mistress. 122 The King’s children defended the
clergy, and the eldest daughter, Henriette. -</p>

<p>sion to the Sacrament. Perusseau died, but his successor, Pere
Desmarets, was equally firm. She stood her ground, but continued her
outward piety. She never forgave the Jesuits for not taking her
“conversion” seriously; per - haps her resentment played a minor part in
their expulsion from France in</p>

<p>She was probably telling the truth in claiming that she no longer had
sexual relations with Louis; d’Argenson, one of her enemies, confirmed
this. 123 She had already confided to her intimates her increasing
difficulty in rising to the royal heats; 124 and she confessed that on
one occasion her lack of enthusiasm had cooled the King into an angry
impotence. 125 She drugged herself with love philters, 126 with little
result but damage to her health. Her foes at court became aware of the
situation, and renewed their plots to sup- plant her. In 1753 d’Argenson
arranged to have the voluptuous Mme. de Choiseul- Romanet slip into the
King’s arms, but she demanded rewards that were thought incommensurate
with her sacrifice, and Pompadour was soon able to have her dismissed.
It was now that the harassed maitresse-en-titre resigned herself to the
abomination of the Parc aux Cerfs.</p>
<p>In this “Stag Park,” at the farther end of Ver sailles, a small
lodging was equipped to house one or two young women, with their
attendants, until such time as Louis received them in his private
apartments or came to their cottage, usually in the guise of a Polish
count. Gossip said that the girls were many; legend added that some were
only nine or ten years old. Ap- parently there were never more than two
at a time, 127 but a succession of them was brought and trained to give
the King the droit du seigneur. When one of them became pregnant she
received from 10,000 to 100,000 livres to help her find a husband in the
provinces, and the children so born were given a pension of some 1 1
,000 livres per year. Mme. de Pompadour knew of this incredible
seraglio, and held her peace. Unwilling to be displaced by some noble
mistress who would doubtless exile her from the court, perhaps from
Paris, she preferred that the King’s depraved tastes should be sated by
young women of lower estate and moderate ambitions; and in this she
herself sank to her lo west estate. “It is his heart that I grudge,” she
told Mme. du Hausset, “and all these young women, who have no education,
will not rob me of that.” 128</p>
<p>The court was not audibly shocked by the new arrangements; several
courtiers themselves maintained cottages for their mistresses in that
same Parc aux Cerfs. 129 But Pompadour’s enemies presumed that her reign
had now come to an end. They were mistaken; the King remained her
devoted friend long after she had ceased to be his concubine. In 1752 he
had offi- cially accorded her the status of duchess. In 1756, over the
Queen’s pro - tests, he gave her the high post of dame du palais de la
reine. She attended the Queen, assisted her at dinner, accompanied her
to Mass. As her new</p>

<p>285</p>
<p>position required her residence at court, the Jesuits withdrew their
demand for her expulsion; the excommunication under which she had long
lived was annulled, and she was admitted to the sacraments. The King’s
daugh - ters, so long hostile to her, came to visit her at Choisy.</p>
<p>Louis spent hours with her almost every day, still taking pleasure in
the intelligence of her conversation, and the charm of her unfailing
grace. He continued to respect, and often to follow, her advice on
appointments, do- mestic measures, even foreign policy. She gave orders
to ministers, received ambassadors, chose generals. Sometimes she spoke
of the King and herself as sharing the government: “nous” (we); “ nous
verrons ” (we shall see). Place seekers crowded her anteroom; she
received them courteously, and could say no graciously. Her foes
admitted the surprising extent of her po- litical knowledge, the skill
of her diplomatic address, the frequent justice of her views. 130 She
had long since pointed to the incompetence of French generals as a
source of France’s military decline; in 1750 she proposed to Louis the
establishment of an Lcole Militaire, where the sons of officers slain or
impoverished in the service of the state should receive instruction in
the art and science of war. The King agreed, but was slow in providing
funds; Pompadour transferred to the enterprise her own income for one
year, and raised additional money through a lottery and a tax on playing
cards; at last (1758) the school was opened, as an adjunct to the Hotel
des Invalides.</p>
<p>Now this bewitching minister without portfolio advised a daring
revision of foreign policy for France. Probably the initiative in this
fateful “reversal of alliances” was taken by Count von Kaunitz, the
Austrian ambassador at Paris; it was furthered by the reluctant
condescension of the pious Empress Maria Theresa, who addressed
Pompadour as “ma bonne amie” and “ma cousine,” and by Frederick the
Great’s insulting reference to the Marquise as “ Cotillon Quatre,”
Petticoat Four, at the French court. Mme. de Cha - teauroux and the
Marquis d’Argenson had directed foreign policy toward friendship with
Prussia. Kaunitz and Pompadour pointed out that the new’ Prussia —
strengthened by victory in the War of the Austrian Succession, armed
with 150,000 trained soldiers, and led by an able, ambitious, and un-
scrupulous general and king who had twice betrayed France by signing a
separate peace — would soon be a greater danger than Austria, which had
now lost Silesia, and could no longer expect support from a Spain under
Bourbon rule; the old Hapsburg encirclement of France was gone. The
argument took on sharper point when (January 16, 1756) Prussia signed an
alliance with England — France’s historic enemy. The French Council of
State replied by signing an alliance with Austria (May 1 ) . The
Marquise de Pompadour, now again spitting blood, still but thirty-five
years old, and with but eight years of life left in her, had played her
part in setting the stage for the Seven Years’ War.</p>
