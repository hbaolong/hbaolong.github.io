<h4 id="chapter-v-voltaire-patriarch">CHAPTER V Voltaire Patriarch</h4>
<p>1 75 8-78</p>
<p>I. THE GOOD LORD</p>
<p>J N October, 1758, Voltaire bought an ancient estate at Ferney, in
the pays, or county, of Gex, which bordered on Switzerland. Soon
thereafter he added, by a life purchase, the neighboring seigneury of
Tournay; now he became legally a lord, and in legal matters he signed
himself “Comte de Tournay”; he displayed his coat of arm s over his
portal and on his silver plate. 1</p>
<p>He had lived at Les Delices in Geneva since 1755, and had played with
pleasure and acclaim the role of a millionaire philosopher who
entertained handsomely. But d’Alembert’s Ency elope die article on
Geneva, revealing the private heresies of its clergymen, subjected
Voltaire to charges that he had betrayed them to his friend. He ceased
to be persona grata on Swiss soil, and looked about him for another
residence. Ferney was in France, but only three miles from Geneva; there
he could thumb his nose at the Calvinist lead- ers; and if the Catholic
leaders in Paris — 250 miles away — should renew their campaign for his
arrest, he could in an hour be across the frontier; mean- while
(1758-70) his friend the Due de Choiseul was heading the French
ministry. Perhaps to guard against confiscation through a veering of the
po- litical wind, he bought Ferney in the name of his niece Mme. Denis,
merely stipulating with her that she should recognize him as master of
the estate as long as he lived. Till 1 764 Les Delices remained his
principal home; he took his time remodeling the house at Ferney, and
finally moved into it in that year.</p>
<p>The new mansion was of stone, was largely designed by Voltaire, and
contained fourteen bedrooms; the seigneur had prepared for his court.
“It is not a palace,” he wrote, “but a commodious country house, with
lands ad - jacent that produce much hay, wheat, straw, and oats. I have
some oaks as straight as pines, which touch the sky.” 2 Tournay added an
old chateau, a farm, a barn, stables, fields, and woods. Altogether his
stables sheltered horses, oxen, and fifty cows; his barns were spacious
enough to store the produce of his lands and yet leave room for wine
presses, poultry yards, and a sheep fold; four hundred beehives kept the
plantation humming; and the trees gave wood to warm the Master’s bones
against the winter winds. He bought and planted young trees, and grew
many more from seedlings in his hothouses. He extended the gardens and
grounds around his home till they measured three miles in circuit; they
included fruit trees, grapevines, and a</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>!33</p>
<p>great variety of flowers. All these structures, plants, and fields,
and their thirty caretakers, he supervised in person. Now again, as when
he entered Les Delices, he was so content that he forgot to die. He
wrote to Mme. du Deffa nd: “I owe my life and health to the course I
have taken. If I dared I would believe myself wise, so happy am I.”
8</p>
<p>Over the thirty or more servants and guests who lived in the chateau
Mme. Denis ruled with an uneven hand. She was good-natured, but she had
a temper, and loved money just a little bit more than she loved anything
else. She called her uncle stingy; he denied it; in any case he
“transferred to her, little by little, the greater part of his fortune.”
4 He had loved her as a child, then as a woman; now he was glad to have
her as his maitresse d’ hotel. She acted in the plays that he staged,
and so well that he compared her to Clairon. This praise went to her
head; she took to writing dramas herself, and Vol- taire was hard put to
dissuade her from exposing them to public view. She was bored by country
life, and longed for Paris; it was partly to amuse her that Voltaire
invited and tolerated so long a succession of guests. She did not care
for his secretary Wagniere, but she was fond of Pere Adam, the old
Jesuit whom Voltaire welcomed to his household as a genial foe at chess
— and whom he surprised one day at the feet of servant Barbara. 5 Once,
perhaps by letting Laharpe depart with one of the Master’s manuscripts,
Denis so angered Voltaire that he sent her off to Paris — with an
annuity of twenty thousand francs. 6 After eighteen months he broke
down, and begged her to return.</p>
<p>Ferney became a goal of pilgrimage for those who could afford travel
and had savored enlightenment. Here came minor rulers like the Duke of
Wiirt- temberg and the Elector Palatine, lords like the Prince de Ligne
and the Dues de Richelieu and Villars, notables like Charles James Fox,
gleaners like Bur- ney and Boswell, rakes like Casanova, and a thousand
lesser souls. He lied lamely when the uninvited came: “Tell them I am
very sick,” “Tell them that I am dead”; but no one believed. “My God!”
he wrote to the Marquis de Villette, “deliver me from my friends; I will
take care of my enemies myself.” 7</p>
<p>He had hardly settled down at Ferney when Boswell appeared (Decem-
ber 24, 1764), still warm with his visits to Rousseau. Voltaire sent
down word that he was still in bed, and could not be disturbed. This was
but a slight discouragement to the eager Scot; he stayed on doggedly
till Voltaire came forth; they conversed briefly, then Voltaire retired
to his study. On the following day, from an inn in Geneva, Boswell wrote
to Mme. Denis:</p>
<p>I must beg your interest, Madam, in obtaining for me a very great
favor from M. de Voltaire. I intend to have the honor to return to
Ferney Wed- nesday or Thursday. The gates of this sober city shut at a
most… absurd hour, so that one is obliged to post away after dinner
before the illustrious landlord has had time to shine upon his
guests….</p>
<p>Is it possible, Madam, that I may be allowed to lodge one night under
the roof of M. de Voltaire? I am a hardy and vigorous Scot. You may
mount me to the highest and coldest garret. I shall not even refuse to
sleep upon two chairs in the bedchamber of your maid. 8</p>
<p>G4</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Voltaire bade his niece tell the Scot to come; there would be a bed
for him. He came on December 27, spoke with Voltaire while Voltaire was
playing chess, was charmed by the Master’s English conversation and
curses, and then was “very genteelly lodged” in “a handsome room.” 9 On
the morrow he undertook to convert Voltaire to orthodox Christianity;
soon Voltaire, almost fainting, had to beg a respite. A day later
Boswell discussed his land- lord’s religion with Pere Adam, who told
him, “I pray for Monsieur de V ol - taire every day…. It is a pity that
he is not a Christian. He has many</p>
<p>Christian virtues. He has the most beautiful soul. He is benevolent;
he is charitable; but he is very strongly prejudiced against the
Christian</p>
<p>religion.” 10</p>
<p>To entertain his guests Voltaire provided food, wisdom, wit, and
drama. Near his home he built a small theater; Gibbon, seeing it in
1763, described it as “very neat and well contrived, situated just by
his chapel, which is far inferior to it.” 11 The philosopher laughed at
Rousseau and the Genevan min - isters, who condemned the sta ge as the
Devil’s rostrum. He trained not only Mme. Denis but his servants and
guests to take parts in his and other plays; he himself pranced across
the boards in principal roles; and professional actors were readily
persuaded to perform for the most famous writer in the world.</p>
<p>Visitors found his appearance almost as fascinating as his
conversation. The Prince de Ligne described him as muffled up in a
flower-patterned dressing gown, an immense wig topped with a bonnet of
black velvet, jacket of fine cotton reaching to his knees, red breeches,
gray stockings, shoes of white cloth. 12 His eyes were “brilliant and
filled with fire,” according to - ceive it possible for life to subsist
in a form so nearly composed of skin and bone…. He supposed I was
anxious to form an idea of… one walking after death.” 16 He described
himself as “ridiculous for not being dead.” 17</p>
<p>He was sick half his life. He had an especially sensitive epidermis;
he com- plained frequently of various itches, 18 perhaps from
nervousness or excessive cleanliness. He suffered at times from
strangury — slow and painful urination; in this regard he and Rousseau,
so often at odds, were brothers under the skin. He drank coffee at every
turn: fifty times a day, according to Frederick the Great; 19 three
times a day, said Wagniere. 20 He laughed at doctors, and noted that L
ouis XV had outlived forty of his physicians; and “who ever heard of a
centenarian doctor?” 21 — but he himself used many medicines. He agreed
with Moliere’s candidate for the M.D. that the best remedy in any
serious illness is clisterium donare ; 22 he purged himself thrice a
week with a cassia solution, or with a soapy enema. 23 The best
medicine, he thought, was</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>preventive, and the best preventive was to clean the internal organs
and the external integument. 24 Despite his years, ailments, and
visitors, he worked with the energy that comes to a man who does not
carry surplus flesh. Wag- niere reckoned that his master slept “not more
than five or six hours” a day. 25 He worked far into the night, and
sometimes he roused Father Adam from bed to help him hunt a Greek word.
26</p>
<p>He held action to be a good remedy for philosophy and suicide. Still
bet- ter, action outdoors. Voltaire literally cultivated his garden;
sometimes he plowed or sowed with his own hands. 27 Mme. du Deffand
detected in his letters the pleasure with which he saw his cabbages
grow. He hoped that posterity would remember him at least for the
thousands of trees that he had planted. He reclaimed wastelands and
drained swamps. He set up a breeding stable, brought in ten mares, and
welcomed the Marquis de Voyer’s offer of a stallion. “My seraglio is
ready,” he wrote, “nothing is wanting but the sultan…. So much has been
written of late years on population that I wish at least to people the
land of Gex with horses, since I am little able to have the honor of
increasing my own species.” 28 To the physiologist Haller he wrote: “The
best thing we can do on this earth is to cultivate it; all other
experiments in phys ics are by comparison children’s play. Honor to
those who sow the earth; woe to the miserable man — crowned or helmeted
or tonsured — who troubles it!” 29</p>
<p>Not having enough land to give agricultural employment to all the
popu- lation around him, he organized in Ferney and Tournay shops for
watch- making and the weaving of stockings — for which his mulberry
trees grew silk. He gave employment to all who asked for it, until he
had eight hundred persons working for him. He built a hundred houses for
his workers, lent them money at four per cent, and helped them find
markets for their prod- ucts. Soon crowned heads were buying the watches
of Ferney, and titled ladies, seduced by his letters, wore stockings
some of which he claimed to have woven with his own hand. Catherine II
bought Ferney watches to the value of 39,000 livres, and offered to help
him find outlets in Asia. Within three years the watches, clocks, and
jewelry made in Ferney went in regular shipments to Holland, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Turkey, Russia, China, and America.
As a result of the new industries Ferney grew from a village of forty
peasants to a population of twelve hundred during Voltaire’s stay. “Give
me a fair chance,” he wrote to Richelieu, “and I am the man to build a
city.” 30 Catholics and Protestants lived in peace on the lands of the
infidel.</p>
<p>His relations with his “vassals” were those of a bon seigneur. He
treated</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>of his time in practical administration. He excused himself for not
leaving Femey to visit his friends: “I have eight hundred people to
guide and sus - tain;… I cannot absent myself without having everything
relapse into chaos.” 34 His su ccess as an administrator astonished all
who saw the results. “He showed clear judgment and very good sense,”
said one of his severest critics. 35 Those whom he governed learned to
love him; on one occasion they threw laurel leaves into his coach as he
passed. 36 The young people were es- pecially fond of him, for he opened
his chateau to them every Sunday for dancing and refreshments; 37 he
urged them on, and rejoiced in their joy. “He was very happy,” reported
Mme. de Gallatin, “and did not perceive that he was eighty- two years
old.” 38 He perceived it, but was content, “Je deviens patriarche,” he
wrote— “I am becoming a patriarch.” 39</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SCEPTER OF THE PEN</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile he continued to write, to send forth an incredible
quantity, variety, and quality of histories, treatises, dramas, stories,
poems, articles, pamphlets, letters, and critical reviews to an
international audience that waited eagerly for his every word. In the
one year 1768 he wrote V Homme mix quarante ecus, La Princesse de Baby
lone (one of his best tales), Lpitre a Boileau, Profession de foi d’un
theiste, Le Pyrrhonisme de Fhistoire, two comic-opera librettos, and a
play. Almost every day he composed some “fugitive verse”— short, light,
graceful epigrams in rhyme; in this department he has no equal in all
literature, not even in the composite excellence of the Greek
Anthology.</p>
<p>His writings on religion and philosophy have occupied us elsewhere.
We look only briefly at the plays that he wrote at Femey — Tancrede,
Nanine, UBcossaise, Socrate, Saul, Irene; they are the least alive of
his progeny, though they were the talk of Paris in his day. Tancrede,
presented at the Theatre- Frangais September 3, 1759, won universal
applause, even f rom Voltaire’s bitter enemy Freron. Mile. Clairon as
Deborah and Lekain as Tancrede reached in this drama the peak of their
art. The stage had been cleared of spectators, and allowed a spacious
and striking decor; the medieval and chiv- alric subject was a welcome
deviation from classic themes; indeed, the disciple of Boileau here
wrote a romantic play. Nanine revealed that Vol- taire, like Diderot,
had been influenced by Richardson; Rousseau himself praised it. Socrate
contained a treasurable line: “It is the triumph of reason to live well
with those who have none.” 40</p>
<p>Hailed in his time as the equal of Corneille and Racine, Voltaire
studied them endlessly, and long hesitated as to which of the two he
preferred; fi- nally he voted for Racine. He boldly placed both above
Sophocles and Eurip- ides, and he ranked “Moliere, in his best pieces,
superior to the pure but cold Terence, and to the buffoon Aristophanes.”
41 He was aroused when he learned that Marie Corneille, grand-niece of
the dramatist, was living in pov- erty near Evreux; he offered to adopt
her and provide for her education; and</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>*37</p>
<p>when he learned that she was pious he assured her that every
opportunity would be given to practice her religion. She came to him in
December, 1760; he adopted her, taught her to write good French,
corrected her pronuncia- tion, and went to Mass with her. To raise a
dowry for her he proposed to the French Academy that it should
commission him to edit the works of Corneille. It agreed. He began at
once to reread the plays of his predeces- sor, to supply introductions
and notes; and, being a good businessman, he advertised the project and
solicited subscriptions. Louis XV, Czarina Eliza- veta, Frederick of
Prussia each subscribed for two hundred copies, Mme. de Pompadour and
Choiseul for fifty, and additional subscriptions came from Chesterfield
and other foreign notables. The result was that Marie Corneille had many
suitors. She married twice, and became in 1768 the mother of Charlotte
Corday.</p>
<p>Voltaire was the greatest historian, as well as the greatest poet and
drama- tist, of his time. In 1757 the Empress Elizaveta asked him to
write a biog- raphy of her father, Peter the Great. She invited Voltaire
to St. Petersburg, and promised him a world of honors. He replied that
he was too old to undertake such travel, but that he would write the
history if her minister, Count Shuvalov, would send hi m documents
illustrating Peter’s career and the changes produced by the Czar’s
reforms. He had in his youth seen Peter</p>
<p>On and off, while the Seven Years’ War raged around him, he undertook
to bring up to date his Histoire generate, or Essai sur les moeurs, by
adding ( r 755 — 6 3 ) a Precis du siecle de Louis XV. It was a delicate
operation, for he was still formally under the ban of the French
government; we must forgive him if he glided cautiously over the faults
of the reigning King; even so it was an excellent narrative, simple and
clear; in telling the story of Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie
Prince Charlie) he almost rivaled his own Charles XII. True to his
conception of history as being best when recording the advances of the
human mind, he added a concluding discourse “On the Pro gress of the
Understanding in the Age of Louis XV,” and noted what</p>
<p>A whole order [the Jesuits] abolished by the secular power, the
discipline of other orders reformed by this power, the divisions between
the [jurisdiction of] magistrates and bishops, plainly reveal how much
prejudice has been dissipated, how far the knowledge of government is
extended, and to what degree our minds are enlightened. The seeds of
this knowledge were sown in the last</p>
<p>i 3 8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>century; in the present they are everywhere springing, even in the
remotest provinces…. Pure science has illuminated the useful arts, and
these have al- ready begun to heal the wounds of the state caused by two
fatal wars…. The knowledge of nature, and the discrediting of ancient
fables once honored as history; sound metaphysics freed from the
absurdities of the schools: these are products of this age, and human
reason is greatly improved.</p>
<p>Having paid his debt to history, Voltaire returned to philosophy, and
to his campaign against the Catholic Church. He issued in rapid
succession those little books which we have already examined, as light
artillery in the war against T infame: The Ignorant Philosopher,
Important Examination of Milord Bolingbroke, L’ Ingenu (or The Huron),
Histoire de Jenni, and La Raison par alphabet. Amid all these labors he
carried on the most remarkable correspondence ever maintained by one
man.</p>
<p>When Casanova visited him in 1760 Voltaire showed him a collection of
some fifty thousand letters that he had received to that year; there
were to be, thereafter, almost as many more. As the recipient paid the
postage, Vol- taire sometimes spent a hundred livres for the mail that
he received in one day. A thousand admirers, a thousand enemies, a
hundred young authors, a hundred amateur philosophers, sent him gifts,
bouquets, insults, curses, queries, and manuscripts. It was not unusual
for an anxious inquirer to beg him to say, by return post, whether there
was a God, or whether man had an immortal soul. Finally he inserted a
warning in the Mercure de France: “Several persons having complained of
not rece iving acknowledgment of packages sent to Ferney, Tourney, or
Les Delices, notice is given that, on account of the immense number of
those packages, it has become necessary to decline receiving all that do
not come from persons with whom the pro- prieto r had the honor to be
acquainted.” 43</p>
<p>In the definitive edition by Theodore Besterman Voltaire’s correspond
- ence fills ninety- eight volumes. Brunetiere thought it “the most
living por - tion of his entire work.” 44 And in truth there is not a
dull page in the whole immensity, for in these letters we can still hear
the most brilliant conversa- tionalist of his time talk with all the
intimacy of a friend. Never before or since has a writer caught on his
running pen — currente calamo — so much courtesy, vivacity, charm, and
grace. It is a feast not only of wit and elo- quence but of warm
friendship, humane feeling, and incisive thought. Beside them the
letters of Mme. de Sevigne, delightful though they are, seem to flutter
casually over the surface of trivial and transitory things. Doubtless
there was something of convention in the flourishes of Voltaire’s
epistolary style, but he seems to mean it when he writes to d’Alembert:
“I embrace you with all my strength, and I regret that it must be at so
great a distance.” (To which d’Alembert replied: “Farewell, my dear and
illustrious friend; I em - brace you tenderly, and am more than ever
tuus in animo”— yours in spirit.) 45 And hear Voltaire to Mme. du
Deffand: “Ad ieu, madame…. Of all the truths that I seek, that which

<p>His letters to his acquaintances in Paris were prized by the
recipients, and were passed from hand to hand as nuggets of news and
gems of style. For it was in his letters that Voltaire’s style reached
its fullest brilliance. It was not</p>
<p>but in his letters he could let the diamond point of his pen flash
into epigram, or illuminate a topic with incomparable precision and
brevity. He added the learning of Bayle to the elegance of Fontenelle,
and took a touch of irony from the Lettres provinciates of Pascal. He
contradicted himself in his seventy years of writing, but he was never
obscure; we can hardly believe that he was a philosopher, he is so
clear. He goes directly to the point, to the vital spot of an idea. He
is sparing of adjectives and similes, lest he com- plicate the thought,
and almost every other sentence is a flash of light. Some- times there
are too many flashes, too many strokes of wit; now and then the reader
tires of the sparkle, and loses some darts of Voltaire’s agile mind. He
realized that this excess of brilliance was a fault, like gems on a r
obe. “The French language,” he modestly confessed, “was carried to the
highest point of perfection in the age of Louis XIV.” 47</p>
<p>Half the notables of the time were among his correspondents — not
only all the philo sophes , and all the major authors of France and
England, but cardinals, popes, kings, and queens. Christian VII
apologized to him for not installing all Voltairean reforms at once in
Denmark; Stanislas Poniatowski of Poland mourned that he had been
precipitated into royalty just as he was on the way to Ferney; Gustavus
III of Sweden thanked Voltaire for occa- sionally casting a glance at
the cold North, and prayed that “God may pro - long your days, so
precious to humanity.” 48 Frederick the Great scolded him for cruelty to
Maupertuis, and for insolence to kings; 49 but a month later he wrote:
“Health and prosperity to the most malign and most seductive man of
genius who has ever been or ever will be in this world”; 50 and on May
12, 1760, he added:</p>
<p>For my part 1 shall go there [Hades] and tell Virgil that a Frenchman
has surpassed him in his own art. I shall say as much to Sophocles and
Euripides; I shall speak to Thucydides of your histories, to Quintus
Curtius of your Charles XII; and perhaps I shall be stoned by these
jealous dead because a single man has united all their different merits
in himself. 51</p>
<p>On September 19, 1774, Frederick continued his lauds: “After your
death there will be no one to replace you; it will be the end of good
letters in France.” 52 (A mistake, of course; there is never an end of
good literature in France.) And finally, on July 24, 1775, Frederick
lowered his scepter before Voltaire’s pen: “For my part, I am consoled
by having lived in the age of Voltaire; that suffices me.” 53</p>
<p>Catherine the Great wrote to Voltaire as one crowned head to another
— indeed, as a pupil to a teacher. She had read him with delight for
sixteen years before cleaving her way to the throne of Russia; then, in
October, 1763, she began their correspondence by replying in the first
person to a letter in verse which he had sent to a member of her
diplomatic corps. 54</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Voltaire called her the Semiramis of the North, glided gracefully
over her crimes, and became her apologist to France. She begged to be
spared his compliments, he extended them. She prized his partisanship,
for she knew that it was largely through him — and then through Grimm
and Diderot — that she obtained a “good press” in France. French
philosophy became a tool of Russian diplomacy. Voltaire recommended
Assyrian-style scythe- armed chariots to Catherine for use against the
Turks; she had to explain that the unco-operative Turks would not attack
in sufficiently close forma- tion to be conveniently mowed down. 55 He
forgot his hatred of war in his enthusiasm for the possibility that
Catherine’s armies would liberate Greece from the Turks; he called upon
Frmgais , Bretons, Italiens” to support this new crusade; and he mourned
when Semiramis stopped short of his goal. Byron took up his cause.</p>
<p>Many Frenchmen berated Voltaire for his flirtations with royalty;
they felt that he lowered himself in fluttering about thrones and
mouthing com- pliments. And doubtless this fluttering sometimes went to
his head. But he too was playing a diplomatic game. He had never
pretended to republican sentiments; he repeatedly argued that more
progress could be made through “enlightened” kings than by enthroning
the unstable, unlettered, supersti- tious masses. He was warring not
against the state but against the Catholic Church, and in that battle
the support of rulers was a precious aid. We have seen how precious that
support was in his triumphant campaigns for the Calas and the Sirvens.
It was of much moment to him that in his fight for religious toleration
he had both Frederick and Catherine on his side. Nor did he give up hope
of winning Louis XV. He had won Mme. de Pompadour and Choiseul; he wooed
Mme. du Barry. He had no scruples in his strategy; and indeed, before
the end of the reign, he had the support of half the gov- ernment of
France. The battle for religious toleration was won.</p>

<p>What, in politics and economics, did he hope to accomplish? He set
his sights both high and low: his great aim was to free men from
theological myths and priestly power — a task difficult enough; for the
rest he asked for some reforms, but no utopia. He smiled at “those
legislators who govern the universe,… and from their garrets give orders
to kings.” 56 Like nearly all the philosophes, he was opposed to
revolution; he would have been shocked by it — perhaps guillotined.*
Besides, he was scandalously rich, and doubtless his wealth colored his
views.</p>
<p>In 1758 he proposed to invest 500,000 francs (25,000?) in Lorraine.

<p>CHAP, v) VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH 141</p>
<p>On March 17, 1759, he wrote to Frederick: “I derive sixty thousand
livres [5,000?] of my [annual] income from France…. I admit that I
am</p>
<p>very rich.” His fortune had been made through “tips” from financier
friends like the brothers Paris; through winning lotteries in France and
Lorraine; through sharing in his father’s estate; through buying
government bonds; through taking shares in commercial ventures; and
through lending money to individuals. He was content with a six per cent
return, which was mod- erate considering the risks and losses. He lost a
thousand ecus (,750?) in the bankruptcy of the Gilliart firm in Cadiz
(1767). 59 In 1768, referring to the eighty thousand francs (00,000?)
that Voltaire had lent to the Due de Richelieu, Gibbon noted: “The Duke
is ruined, the security worth nothing, and the money vanished”; 60 at
Voltaire’s death a fourth of the loan had been repaid. Pensions brought
Voltaire four thousand francs per year. Alto- gether, in 1777, his
income came to 206,000 francs (57, 500?). 61 He graced this wealth with
commensurate generosity, but he felt called upon to de- fend it as not
necessarily unbecoming a philosopher.</p>
<p>I saw so many men of letters poor and despised that 1 made up my mind
that I would not increase their number. In France a man must be anvil or
hammer; I was bom anvil. A slender patrimony becomes smaller every day,
because in the long run everything increases in price, and government
often taxes both income and money…. You must be economical in your
youth, and you find yourself in your old age in possession of a capital
that surprises you; and that is the time when fortune is most necessary
to us. 62</p>
<p>As far back as 1736, in his poem Le Mondain, he had confessed: “I
love luxury, and even a soft life, all the pleasures, all the arts.” He
held that the</p>
<p>He did not share Rousseau’s enthusiasm for equality; he knew that all
men are created unf ree and unequal. He rejected Helvetius’ notion that
if equal education and opportunity were given to all, all would soon be
equal in edu- cation and ability. “What folly to imagine that every man
could be a New - ton!” 67 At all times there will be stron g and weak,
clever and simple, and therefore rich and poor.</p>
<p>It is impossible in our melancholy world to prevent men who live in a
society from being divided into two classes — one of the rich who
command, the other of the poor who obey…. Every man has a right to
entertain a private opinion of his own equality to other men, but it
does not follow that a</p>

<p>cardinal’s cook should take it upon him to order his master to
prepare his dinner. The cook, however, may say: “I am a man as well as
my master; I was born like him in tears, and shall die like him in
agony…. We both perform the same animal functions. If the Turks get
possession of Rome and I then become a cardinal and my master a cook, I
will take him into my service.” This language is perfectly reasonable
and just, but, while waiting for the Grand Turk to take Rome, the cook
is bound to do his duty, or all human society is subverted. 68</p>
<p>As the son of a notary, and only lately become a seigneur, he had
mingled views about aristocracy, apparently preferring the English type.
69 He ac- cepted monarchy as the natural form of government. “Why is
almost the whole earth governed by monarchs?… The honest answer is;
Because men are rarely worthy of governing themselves.” 70 He laughed at
the divine right of kings, and traced them and the state to conquest. “A
tribe, for its pillaging expeditions, chooses a chief; it accustoms
itself to obey him, he accustoms him self to command; I believe this is
the origin of monarchy.” 71 Is it natural? Look at a farmyard.</p>
<p>A farmyard exhibits the most perfect representation of a monarchy.
There is no king comparable to a cock. If he marches haughtily and
fiercely in the midst of his flock it is not out of vanity. If the enemy
is advancing he does not content himself with issuing an order to his
subjects to go out and get killed for him… ; he goes in person, ranges
his troops behind him, and fights to the last gasp. If he conquers, it
is himself who sings the Te Deum…. If it be true that bees are governed
by a queen to whom all her subjects make love, that is a more perfect
government still. 72</p>
<p>Living in Berlin and then in Geneva, he c ould study monarchy and “de
- mocracy” in their living operation. Like the other philosophies, he
was prejudiced by the fact that several monarchs — Frederick II, Peter
III, Cath- erine II — and some ministers — Choiseul, Aranda, Tanucci,
Pombal — had lis- tened to appeals for reforms, or had given pensions to
philosophers. In an age when the Russian peasant was so primitive, when
the masses everywhere were largely illiterate and too tired to think, it
seemed absurd to propose popular rule. Actually the “democracies” in
Switzerland and Holland were oligarchies. It was the populace that loved
the old myths and ceremonies of religion, and stood as a massive army in
the path of intellectual freedom and development. Only one force was
strong enough to resist the Catholic Church in France, as it had
successfully resisted the Protestant churches in England, Holland, and
Germany; and that was the state. Only through the existing monarchical
governments in France, Germany, and Russia could the philosophes hope to
win their struggle against superstition, bigotry, persecution, and an
infantile theology. They could not expect support from the parlements,
for these rivaled the Church and exceeded the King in obscurantism,
censorship, and intolerance. On the other hand, consider what Henry the
Navigator had done for Portugal, what Henry IV had done for France, or
Peter the Great for Russia, or Frederick the Great for Prussia. “Al -
most nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius
and fi rmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the
multitude.” 73 So the</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>philosophes prayed for enlightened kings. “Virtue on the throne,”
Voltaire wrote in Merope, “is the fairest work of heaven.” 74 *</p>
<p>Voltaire’s politics stemmed partly from a suspicion that many people
would be incapable of digesting education even if it were offered them.
He referred to “the thinking portion of the human race— i.e., the
hundred- thousandth part.” 76 He feared the me ntal immaturity and
emotional ex- citability of the people at large. “ Quand le populace se
mele de raisonner, tout est perdu ” (When the populace takes to
reasoning, all is lost). 77 And so, until his mellower years, he had
little sympathy with democracy. When Casanova asked him, “Would you see
the people possessed of sovereignty?” he answered, “God forbid!” 78 And
to Frederick: “When I begged you to be the restorer of the fine arts of
Greece, my request did not go so far as to beg you to re-establish the
Athenian democracy. I do not like government by the rabble.” 79 He
agreed with Rousseau that “democracy seems to agree</p>
<p>If you remember that the Dutch ate on a grill the heart of the two
brothers De Witt; if you… recall that the republican John Calvin,… after
having written that we should persecute no man, even such as deny the
Trinity, had a Spaniard, who thought otherwise than he about the
Trinity, burned alive by green [slow-burning] fagots; then, in truth,
you will conclude that there is no more virtue in republics than in
monarchies. 81</p>
<p>After all these antidemocratic pronouncements we find him actively
sup- porting the Genevan middle class against the patricians (1763), and
the un- franchised natif s of Geneva against both the aristocracy and
the bourgeoisie ( 1766) ; let us defer this story to its locale.</p>
<p>Indeed, Voltaire seemed to become more radical as he aged. In 1768 he
sent forth his V Homme aux quarante ecus — The Man ’with Forty Crowns.
It went through ten printings in its first year, but was burned by the
Parle- ment of Paris, which sent the printer to the galleys. This
severity was due not to the ridicule which the story lavished upon the
physiocrats, but to its vivid picture of peasants reduced to destitution
by taxation, and of monks living in idleness and luxury on properties
tilled by serfs. In another pam- phlet in 1768, called VA, B, C (which
Voltaire was at great pains to dis- avow), he made “Monsieur B” say:</p>
<p>I could adjust quite easily to a democratic government…. All those
who have possessions in the same territory have the same right to
maintain order in that territory. I like to see free men make the laws
under which they live…. It pleases me that my mason, my carpenter, my
blacksmith, who have helped me to build my lodging, my neighbor the
farmer, my friend the manu-</p>
<ul>
<li>Michelet has a charming passage on this these royale: “It is the
chimera of the philosophes and the economists — of such men as Voltaire
and Turgot — to accomplish the revolution — to achieve the happiness of
mankind — by means of the king. Nothing is more curious than to behold
this idol disputed by both parties. The philosophes pull him to the
right, the priests to the left. Who will carry him off? Women.” 75</li>

<p>facturer, will raise themselves above their trade, and know the
public interest better than the most insolent Turkish official. In a
democracy no laborer, no artisan, need fear either molestation or
contempt…. To be free, to have only equals, is the true, the natural
life of man; all other ways of life are un- worthy artifices, bad
comedies in which one man plays the part of master, the other that of
slave, one that of parasite, the other that of procurer. 82</p>
<p>In or soon after 1769 (aged seventy-five), in a new edition of the
Die - tionnaire philo sophique , Voltaire gave a bitter description of
governmental tyrannies and abuses in France, 83 and praised England by
comparison:</p>
<p>The English constitution has in fact arrived at that point of
excellence whereby all men are restored to those natural rights of
which, in nearly all monarchies, they are deprived. These rights are:
entire liberty of person and property; freedom of the press; the right
of being tried in all criminal cases by a jury of independent men; the
right of being tried only according to the strict letter of the law; and
the right of every man to profess, unmolested, what re- ligion he
chooses while he renounces offices which only the members of the
Established Church may hold. These are… invaluable privileges…. To be
secure, on lying down, that you will rise in possession of the same
property with which you retired to rest; that you will not be torn from
the arms of your wife and your children in the dead of night, to be
thrown into a dungeon or be buried in exile in a desert; that… you will
have the power to publish all your thoughts;… these privileges belong to
every one who sets foot on English soil…. We cannot but believe that
states not established upon such principles will experience revolutions.
84</p>
<p>Like so many observers, he foresaw revolution in France. On April 2,
1764, he wrote to the Marquis de Chauvelin:</p>
<p>Everywhere I see the seeds of an inevitable revolution, which,
however, I shall not have the pleasure to witness. The French come late
to everything, but finally they do come. Enlightenment has been so
widely spread that it will burst out at the first opportunity; and then
there will be quite a pretty explosion. The young are fortunate; they
will see great things.</p>
<p>And yet, when he recalled that he was living in France by sufferance
of a King whom he had offended by taking up residence in Potsdam; when
he saw Pompadour and Choiseul and Malesherbes and Turgot turning the
French government toward religious toleration and political reform — and
perhaps because he longed for permission to return to Paris — he took,
gen- erally, a more patriotic tone, and deprecated violent
revolution:</p>
<p>When the poor strongly feel their poverty, wars follow such as those
of the popular party against the Senate at Rome, and those of the
peasantry in Ger- many, England, and France. All these wars ended sooner
or later in the sub- jection of the people, because the great have
money, and money in a state commands everything 85</p>
<p>So, instead of an upheaval from below, where ability to destroy would
not be followed by ability to rebuild, and the simple many would soon
again be subject to a clever few, Voltaire preferred to work for a
nonviolent revolu- tion through enlightenment passing from thinkers to
rulers, ministers and magistrates, to merchants and m anufacturers, to
artisans and peasants. “Rea - son must first be established in the minds
of leaders; then gradually it de-</p>

<p>H5</p>
<p>scends and at length rules the people, who are unaware of its
existence, but who, perce iving the moderation of their superiors, learn
to imitate them.” 86 In the long run, he thought, the only real
liberation is education, the only real freedom is intelligence. “ Plus
les hommes sont eclaires, plus ils seront libres ” (The more enlightene
d men are, the more they will be free). 87 The only real revolutions are
those that change the mind and heart, and the only real revolutionists
are the sage and the saint.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE REFORMER</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of agitating for a radical political revolution, Voltaire
labored for moderate, piecemeal reform within the existing structure of
French society; and within this self-denying circle he achieved more
than any other man of his time.</p>
<p>His most basic appeal was for a thorough revision of French law,
which had not been revised since 1670. In 1765 he read, in Italian, the
epochal Trattato dei delitti e delle pene of the Milanese jurist
Beccaria, who in turn had been inspired by the philosophes. In 1766
Voltaire issued a Commentaire sur le livre des delits et des peines,
frankly acknowledging Beccaria’s lead;</p>
<p>He demanded, to begin with, the subordination of ecclesiastical to
civil law; a check on the power of the clergy to require degrading
penances or to enforce idleness on so many holydays; he asked for a
mitigation of the penal- ties for sacrilege, and a repeal of the law
insulting the body, and confiscating the property, of suicides. He
insisted on distinguishing sin from crime, and ending the notion that
the punishment of crime should pretend to avenge an insulted God.</p>
<p>No ecclesiastical law should be of any force until it has received
the ex- press sanction of the government…. Everything relating to
marriages de- pends solely upon the magistrates, and priests should be
confined to the august function of blessing the union…. Lending money at
interest is purely an object of civil law…. All ecclesiastics, in all
cases whatsoever, should be under the perfect control of the government,
because they are subjects of the state…. No priest should possess
authority to deprive a citizen of even the smallest of privileges under
pretense that that citizen is a sinner…. The magistrates, cultivators,
and priests should alike contribute to the expenses of the state. 88</p>
<p>He compared the law of France to the city of Paris — a product of
piece- meal building, of chance and circumstance, a chaos of
contradictions; a trav- eler in France, said Voltaire, changed his laws
almost as often as he changed his post horses. 89 All the laws of the
various provinces should be unified and brought into general harmony.
Every law should be clear, precise, and as far as possible immune to
legalistic chicanery. All citizens should be equal in the eyes of the
law. Capital punishment should be abolished as barbarous</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>and wasteful. It is surely barbarous to punish forgery, theft,
smuggling, or arson with death. If theft is punishable with death, the
thief will have no reason for avoiding murder; so in Italy many highway
robberies are accom- panied by assassination. “If you hang on the public
gallows [as happened at Lyons in 1772] the servant girl who stole a
dozen napkins from her mis- tress, she will be unable to add a dozen
children to the number of your citizens…. There is no proportion between
a dozen napkins and a human life.” 90 To confiscate the property of a
man condemned to death is plain robbery of the innocent by the state. If
Voltaire sometimes argued from a merely utilitarian standpoint, it was
because he knew that such arguments would outweigh, with most lawmakers,
any humanitarian appeal.</p>
<p>But on the subject of judicial torture his humanitarian spirit spoke
out forcefully. Judges were allowed by French law to apply torture to
elicit confessions before a trial, if suspicious clues suggested guilt.
Voltaire sought to shame France by referring to Catherine II’s edict
abolishing torture in supposedly barbarous Russia. “The French, who are
consi dered — I know not why — to be a very humane people, are
astonished that the English, who have had the inhumanity to take all
Canada from us, have renounced the pleasure of using torture.” 91</p>
<p>Some judges, he charged, were bullies who acted like prosecutors
instead of judges, apparently on the assumption that the accused was
guilty until proved innocent. He protested against keeping the accused
in foul jails, sometimes in chains and for months, before bringing him
to trial. He noted that a person accused of a major crime was forbidden
to communicate with anyone, even with a lawyer. He related again and
again the treatment of the Calas and the Sirvens as illustrating the
hasty condemnation of innocent persons. He argued that the evidence of
only two persons, even if eye- witnesses, should no longer be held
sufficient to convict a man of murder; he adduced cases of false
witness, and urged that capital punishment be abol- ished if only to
prevent the execution of one innocent in a thousand in- stances. Death
sentences could in France be passed by a majority of two among the
judges; Jean Calas had been sent to death by a vote of eight to five.
Voltaire demanded that a death sentence require an overwhelming
majority, preferably unanimity. “What an absurd horror, to play with the
life and death of a citizen in a game of six to four, or five to three,
or four to two, or three to one!” 92</p>
<p>By and large the reforms suggested by Voltaire were a compromise be-
tween his middle-class heritage, his hatred of the Church, his
experience and investments as a businessman and a landholder, and his
sincere sentiments as a humanitarian. His demands were moderate, but
they were in many cases effective. He campaigned for freedom of the
press, and it was immensely extended — if only by governmental winking —
before he died. He asked for an end to religious persecution, and in
1787 it was practically ended in France. He proposed that Protestants be
permitted to build churches and transmit or inherit property, and enjoy
the full protection of the laws; this was done before the Revolution. He
asked that marriages between persons</p>
<p>CHAP. V)</p>
<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>*47</p>
<p>of different religions be legalized; they were. He denounced the sale
of offices, the taxes on necessaries, the restrictions on internal
trade, the survival of serfdom and mortmain; he advised the state to
recapture from the Church the administration of wills and the education
of youth; and in all these mat- ters his voice had influence on events.
He led the campaign to exclude spec- tators from the stage of the
Theatre-Frangais; it was done in 1759. He rec- ommended that taxes fall
upon all classes, and in proportion to their wealth; this had to wait
for the Revolution. He wanted a revision of French law; it was done in
the Code Napoleon (1807); the most permanent achievement of the
warrior-statesman, who determined the legal structure of France till our
own time, was made possible by jurists and philosophers.</p>
<p>V. VOLTAIRE HIMSELF</p>
<p>How shall we sum him up, this most amazing man of the eighteenth cen-
tury? We need no longer speak of his mind — it has revealed itself in a
hun- dred pages of these volumes. No one has ever challenged him in
quickness and clarity of thought, in sharpness and abundance of wit. He
defined wit with fond care:</p>
<p>What is called wit is sometimes a startling comparison, sometimes a
delicate allusion; or it may be a play upon words — you use a word in
one sense, know- ing that your interlocutor will [at first] understand
it in another. Or it is a sly way of bringing into juxtaposition ideas
not usually considered in association…. It is the art of finding a link
between two dissimilars, or a difference be- tween two similars. It is
the art of saying half of what you mean and leaving the rest to the
imagination. And I would tell you much more about it if I had more of it
myself. 93</p>
<p>No one had more, and perhaps, as we have said, he had too much. His
sense of humor sometimes passed out of control; too often it was coarse,
and occasionally it verged on buffoonery.</p>
<p>The quickness of his perceptions, correlations, and comparisons left
him no pause for consistency, and the swift succession of his ideas did
not always allow him to penetrate a subject to its humanly attainable
depths. Perhaps he disposed too readily of the masses as “canaille”; we
could not expect him to foresee the time when universal education would
be necessary to a tech- nologically progressive economy. He had no
patience with the geological theories of Buffon, or the biological
speculations of Diderot. He recognized his limits, and had his moments
of mo desty. “You think that I express myself clearly enough,” he told a
friend; “I am like the little brooks— they are trans- parent because
they are not deep.” 94 He wrote to Daquin in 1 766:</p>
<p>Since I was twelve years old I divined the enormous quantity of
things for which I have no talent. I know that my organs are not
arranged to go very far in mathematics. I have shown that I have no
inclination for music. Rely upon the esteem of an old philosopher who
has the folly… to think himself a very good farmer, but has not that of
thinking that he has all the talents. 95</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>It would be unfair to ask of a man who dealt with so many matters
that he should have exhausted all available data on every topic before
tossing it on the point of his pen. He was not all scholar; he was a
warrior, a man of letters who made letters a form of action, a weapon of
transformation. Yet we can see from his library of 6,210 volumes, and
their marginal comments, that he studied eagerly and painstakingly an
astonishing variety of subjects, and that in politics, history,
philosophy, theology, and Biblical criticism he was a very learned man.
The range of his curiosity and his interests was im- mense; so were the
wealth of his ideas and the retentiveness of his memory. He took no
tradition for granted, but examined everything for himself. He had a
proper skepticism which did not hesitate to oppose common sense to the
absurdities of science as well as the legends of the popular faith. An
unprejudiced scholar called him “a thinker who amassed more accurate in
- formation about the world in all its aspects than any man since
Aristotle.” 96 Never elsewhere has one mind transposed into literature
and action so ex- tensive a mass of materials from such a diversity of
fields.</p>
<p>We have to picture him as the strangest amalgam of emotional
instability with mental vision and power. His nerves kept him always on
the jump. He could not sit still except when absorbed in literary
composition. When the lady with only one buttock asked, “Which is worse—
to be ravished a hun- dred times by Negro pirates, to have one’s rump
gashed,… to be cut to pieces, to row in the galleys,… or to sit still
and do nothing?,” Candide answered thoughtfully, “That is a great
question.” 97 Voltaire had days of happiness, but he seldom knew peace
of mind or body. He had to be busy, active, buying, selling, planting,
writing, acting, reciting. He feared boredom worse than death, and in a
bored moment he maligned life as “either ennui or whipped cream.” 98</p>
<p>We could draw an ugly picture of him if we described his appearance
without noting his eyes, or listed his faults and follies without his
virtues and his charm. He was a bourgeois gentilhomme who felt that he
had as much right to a title as his dilatory debtors. He rivaled the
lordliest seigneur in grace of manners and speech, but he was capable of
haggling over small sums, and bombarded President de Brosses with
vituperative missiles over fourteen cords of wood — which he insisted on
accepting as a gift and not a sale. He loved money as the root of his
security. Mme. Denis accused him of parsimony in no measured terms: “The
love of money torments you…. You are, in heart, the lowest of men. I
shall hide as well as I can the vices of your heart”; 99 but when she
wrote this (1754) she was living ex - travagantly in Paris on funds that
were a serious drain on his purse; and for the rest of her years with
him she lived in state at Ferney.</p>
<p>Before and after becoming a millionaire he cultivated the socially or
po- litically powerful with a flattery that sometimes came close to
sycophancy. In an Epitre au Cardinal Dubois he called that vessel of
vices a greater man than Cardinal Richelieu. 100 When he was seeking
admission to the French Academy and needed ecclesiastical support, he
assured the influential Pere de La Tour that he wished to live and die
in the Holy Catholic Church. 101 His printed lies would make a book;
many were not printed, some were</p>

<p>VOLTAIRE PATRIARCH</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>unprintable. He held this procedure justifiable in war; he felt that
the Seven Years’ War was merely the sport of kings compared with his
thirty years’ war against the Church; and a government that could jail a
man for tell- ing the truth could not justly complain if he lied. On
September 19, 1764, at the top of his war, he wrote to d’Alembert: “As
soon as the slightest danger comes up, kindly notify me, so that I may
disown my writings in the public press with my habitual candor and
innocen ce.” He denied almost all his works except the Henriade and the
poem on the battle of Fontenoy. “One must show the truth to posterity
with boldness, and to his contemporaries with circumspection. It is very
hard to reconcile these two duties.” 102</p>
<p>It goes without saying that he was vain: vanity is the spur of
development, and the secret of authorship. Usually Voltaire kept his
vanity under con- trol; he frequently revised his writings according to
suggestions and criticism offered in good spirit. He was generous in
praise of authors who did not com- pete with him — Marmontel, Laharpe,
Beaumarchais. But he could be child- ishly jealous of competitors, as in
his slyly critical Eloge de Crebillon [pere ] ; Diderot thought he had
“a grudge against every pedestal.” 103 His jealousy led him to
scurrilous abuse of Rousseau: he called him “the clockmaker’s boy,” “a
Judas who betrayed philosophy,” “a mad dog who bites every - body,” “a
madman born of a chance mating of Diogenes’ dog with that of Erasis
tratus.” 104 He thought the first half of Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heloise
had been composed in a brothel, and the second in a madhouse. He
predicted that Emile would be forgotten after a month’s time. 105 He
felt that Rousseau had turned his back upon that French civilization
which, with all its sins and crimes, was precious to Voltaire as the
very wine of history.</p>
<p>Being nerves and bones with little flesh, Voltaire was even more
sensitive than Rousseau. And as we must feel our pains more keenly than
our pleas- ures, so he took commendation in his stride but was “reduced
to despair” by an adverse critique. 106 He was seldom wise enough to
restrain his pen; he answered every opponent, however small. Hume
described him as one “who never forgives [? ], and never thinks an enemy
beneath his notice.” 107 Against persistent foes like Desfontaines and
Freron he fought without restraint or truce; he used every device of
satire, ridicule, and vituperation, even crafty distortion of the truth.
108 His rancor shocked old friends and made new enemies. “I know how to
hate,” he said, “because I know how to love.” 109 “By my stars [I am] a
bit inclined to malice”; 110 so he successfully moved all his cohorts to
defeat de Brosses’ candidacy for the Academy (1770 ). He summed up the
matter in a mixture of d’Artagnan and Rabelais:</p>
<p>As for my puny self, I make war up to the last moment — Jansenists,
Molin- ists, Frerons, Pompignans to the right and to the left, and
preachers, and Jean- Jacques Rousseau. I receive a hundred thrusts and
give back two hundred, and I laugh…. God be praised! I look upon the
whole world as a farce which sometimes becomes tragic. All is the same
at the end of the day, and all is still the same at the end of days.
111</p>
<p>In his anti-Semitism he turned upon an entire people the resentment
gen- erated by his encounters with a few individuals. From the
standpoint of those memories Voltaire interpreted the history of the
Jews, noting their</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>faults meticulously, and seldom giving them the benefit of a doubt.
He could not forgive the Jews for having begotten Christianity. “When I
see Christians cursing Jews methinks I see children beating their
fathers.” 112 He saw in the Old Testament hardly anything but a record
of murder, lechery, and wholesale assassination. The Book of Proverbs
seemed to him “a col - lection of trivial, sordid, incoherent maxims,
without taste, without selec- tion, and without design”; and the Song of
Songs was to him “an inept rhapsody.” 113 However, he praised the Jews
for their ancient disbelief in immortality, for refraining from
proselytism, and for relative tolerance; the Sadducees denied the
existence of angels, but suffered no persecution for heresy.</p>
<p>Did his virtues outweigh his vices? Yes, and even if we do not place
in the scale his intellectual with his moral qualities. Against his
parsimony we must place his generosity, against his love of money his
cheerful acceptance of losses and his readiness to share his gains. Hear
Collini, who as his secretary for many years must have known his
faults:</p>
<p>Nothing is more baseless than the reproach of avarice made against
him…. Stinginess never had a place in his home. I have never known a man
whom his domestics could more easily rob. He was a miser only of his
time…. He had, with regard to money, the same principles as for time: it
was necessary, he said, to economize in order to be liberal. 114</p>
<p>His letters reveal some of the many gifts he distributed, usually
without re- vealing his name, and not only to friends and acquaintances,
but even to persons whom he had never seen. 115 He allowed the
booksellers to keep the profit from his books. We have seen him helping
Mile. Corneille; we shall see him helping Mile. Varicourt. We have seen
him helping Vauvenargues and Marmontel; he did the same to Laharpe, who
failed as a dramatist before developing into the most influential critic
in France; Voltaire asked that half of his own governmental pension of
two thousand francs be given to La- harpe, without letting him know who
was the donor. 116 “Everyone knows,” wrote Marmontel, “with what
kindness he received all young men who showed any talent for poetry.”
117</p>
<p>If Voltaire, conscious of his puny size, had little physical courage
(allow- ing himself to be caned by Captain Beauregard in 1722 118 ), he
had astonish- ing moral courage (attacking the most powerful institution
in history, the Roman Catholic Church). If he was bitter in controversy,
he was quick to forgive opponents who sought reconciliation; “his fury
vanished with the first appeal.” 119 He lavished affection upon all who
asked for it, and was loyal to his friends. When, after twenty-four
years of association, he parted from Wagniere, “he cried like a child.”
120 As to his sexual moral - ity, it was above the level of his time
with Mme. du Chatelet, below that level with his niece. He was tolerant
of sexual irregularity, but rose in fine fury against injustice,
fanaticism, persecution, hypocrisy, and the cruelties of the penal law.
He defined morality as “doing good to mankind”; for the rest he laughed
at prohibitions, and enjoyed wine, woman, and song in philo-</p>

<p>sophical moderation. In a little story called “Bababec” he disposed
of asceti - cism with characteristic pungency. Omni asks the Brahmin if
there is any chance of his eventually reaching the nineteenth
heaven.</p>
<p>“It depends,” replied the Brahmin, “on what kind of life you
lead.”</p>
<p>“I try to be a good citizen, a good husband, a good father, a good
friend. I sometimes lend money without interest to the rich; I give to
the poor; I pre- serve peace among my neighbors.”</p>
<p>“But,” asked the Brahmin, “do you occasionally stick nails into your
behind?”</p>
<p>“Never, reverend father.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” the Brahmin replied; “you will certainly never attain
to the nineteenth heaven.” 121</p>
<p>Voltaire’s crowning and redeeming virtue was his humanity. He stirred
the conscience of Europe with his campaigns for the Calas and the
Sirvens. He denounced war as “the great illusion”: “The victorious
nation never profits from the spoils of the conquered; it pays for
everything; it suffers as much when its armies are successful as when
they are defeated”; 122 whoever wins, humanity loses. He pleaded with
men of diverse needs and states to remember that they were brothers; and
that plea was heard with gratitude in the depths of Africa. 123 Nor was
he subject to Rousseau’s charge that those who preached love of mankind
spread their love so widely that they had little left for their
neighbor; all who knew him remembered his kindness and courtesy to the
lowliest persons around him. He respected every ego, know- ing its
sensitivity from knowing his own. 124 His hospitality survived the
excessive calls upon it. “How moved I was,” wrote Mme. de Graffigny, “to
find you always as perfectly good as you are great, and to see you doing
all about you the good that you would have liked to do to all humanity.”
125 He could be irascible and break out in a temper, but “you could
never imag - ine,” wrote another visitor, “how lovable this man is in
his heart.” 126</p>
<p>As the fame of his help to persecuted persons spread through Europe,
and reports circulated through France of his private charities and
beneficence, a new image of Voltaire took form in the public mind. He
was no longer Anti- christ, no longer the warrior against a faith
beloved by the poor; he was the savior of the Calas, the good seigneur
of Ferney, the defender of a hundred victims of intolerant creeds and
unjust laws. Genevan clergymen expressed their wonder whether, at the
Last Judgment, their faith would balance the works of this impious man.
127 Educated men and women forgave his impiety, his quarrels, his
vanity, even his malice; they saw him grow out of hostility into
benevolence; and they thought of him now as the venerable patriarch of
French letters, the glory of France before the literate world. This was
the man whom even the populace would acclaim when he came to Paris to
die.</p>
