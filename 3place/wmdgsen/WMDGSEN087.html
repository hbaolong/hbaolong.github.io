<h4 id="chapter-xx-vm-the-climax-of-greek-science">CHAPTER XX vm The
Climax of Greek Science</h4>
<p>I. EUCLID AND APOLLONIUS</p>
<p>T he fifth century saw the zenith of Greek literature, the fourth
the</p>
<p>flowering of philosophy, the third the culmination of science.
The</p>
<p>kings proved more tolerant and helpful to research than the
democracies. Alexander sent to the Greek cities of the Asiatic coast
camel loads of Bab- ylonian astronomical tablets, most of which were
soon translated into Greek; the Ptolemies built the Museum for advanced
studies, and gathered the sci- ence as well as the literature of the
Mediterranean cultures into the great Library; Apollonius dedicated his
Conics to Attalus I, and under the pro- tection of Hieron II Archimedes
drew his circles and reckoned the sand. The fading of frontiers and the
establishment of a common language, the fluid interchange of books and
ideas, the exhaustion of metaphysics and the weakening of the old
theology, the rise of a secularly minded commercial class in Alexandria,
Rhodes, Antioch, Pergamum, and Syracuse, the mul- tiplication of
schools, universities, observatories, and libraries, combined with
wealth, industry, and royal patronage to free science from philosophy,
and to encourage it in its work of enlightening, enriching, and
endangering the world.</p>
<p>About the opening of the third century — perhaps long before it — the
tools of the Greek mathematician were sharpened by the development of a
simpler no- tation. The first nine letters of the alphabet were used for
the digits, the next letter for lo, the next nine for 20, 30, etc., the
next for 100, the next for 200, 300, and so forth. Fractions and
ordinals were expressed by an acute accent after the letter; so,
according to the context, i* stood for one tenth or tenth; and a small t
under a letter indicated the corresponding thousand. This arithmetical
short- hand provided a convenient system of computation; some extant
Greek papyri crowd complicated calculations, ranging from fractions to
millions, into less space than similar reckonings would require in our
own numerical notation.* Nevertheless the greatest victories of
Hellenistic science were in geometry. To this period belongs Euclid,
whose name would for two thousand years pro-</p>
<p>• These papyri are not older than Alexandria; but since they use the
primitive digamma to represent 6, it is probable that the alphabetical
notation antedated the Hellenistic age.</p>

<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>vide geometry with a synonym. All that we know of his life is that he
opened a school at Alexandria, and that his students excelled all others
in their field; that he care d nothing about money, and when a pupil
asked, “What shall I profit from learning geometry?” bade a slave give
him an obol, “since he must make a gain out of what he learns”;^ that he
was a man of great modesty and kindliness; and that when, about 300, he
wrote his famous Elements, it never occurred to him to credit the
various propositions to their discoverers, because he made no pretense
at doing more than to bring together in logical order the geometrical
knowledge of the Greeks.’*’ He began, witho ut preface or apology, with
simple definitions, then postulates or necessary assumptions, then
“common notions” or axioms. Following Plato’s injunctions, he confined
himself to such figures and proofs as needed no other instruments than
ruler and compasses. He adopted and perfected a method of progressive
exposition and demonstration already familiar to his predecessors:
proposition, diagrammatic illustration, proof, and conclu- sion. Despite
minor flaws the total result was a mathematic^ architecture that rivaled
the Parthenon as a symbol of the Greek mind. Actually it outlived the
Parthenon as an integral form; for until our own century the Elements of
Euclid constituted the accepted textbook of geometry in nearly every
European uni- versity. One must go to the Bible to find a rival for it
in enduring influence.</p>
<p>A lost work of Euclid, the Conics, summarized the studies of
Menaechmus, Aristaeus, and others on the geometry of the cone.
Apollonius of Perga, after years of study in Euclid’s school , took this
treatise as the starting point of his own Comes, and explored in eight
“books” and 387 propositions the properties of the curves generated by
the intersection of a cone by a plane. To three of these curves (the
fourth being the circle) he gave their lasting names — parabola,
ellipse, and hyperbola. His discoveries made possible the theory of
projectiles, and substantially advanced mechanics, navigation, and
astronomy, ffis exposi- tion was laborious and verbose, but his method
was completely scientific; his work was as definitive as Euclid’s, and
its seven extant books are to this day the</p>

<li>ARCHIMEDES</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest of ancient scientists was born at Syracuse about 287
b.c., son of the astronomer Pheidias, and apparently cousin to Hieron
II, the most enlightened ruler of his time. Like many other Hellenistic
Greeks who were interested in science and could afford the expense,
Archimedes went to Alexandria; there he studied under the successors of
Euclid, and derived</p>

</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXVin) THE CLIMAX OF GREEK SCIENCE 629</p>
<p>an inspiration for mathematics that gave him two boons — an absorbed
life and a sudden death. Returning to Syracuse, he devoted himself
monas- tically to every branch of mathematical science. Often, like
Newton, he neglected food and drink, or the care of his body, in order
to pursue the consequences of a new theorem, or to draw figures in the
oil on his body, the ashes on the hearth, or the sand with which Greek
geometers were wont to str ew their floors.’ He was not without humor;
in what he considered his best book. The Sphere and the Cylinder, he
deliberately inserted false propositions (so we are assured), partly to
play a joke upon the friends to whom he sent the manuscript, partly to
ensnare poachers who liked to ap- propriate other men’s thoughts.’
Sometimes he amused himself with puzzles that brought him to the verge
of inventing algebra, like the famous Cattle Problem that so beguiled
Lessing;* sometimes he made strange mechanisms to study the principles
on which they operated. But his perennial interest and delight lay in
pure science conceived as a key to the understanding of the universe
rather than as a tool of practical construction or expanding wealth. He
wrote not for pupils but for professional scholars, communi- cating to
them in pithy monographs the abstruse conclusions of his research. All
later antiquity was fascinated by the originality, depth, and clarity of
these treatises. “It is not possible,” said Plutarch, three centuries
later, “to find in all geometry more difficult and intricate questions,
or more simple and lucid explanations. Some ascribe this to his natural
genius; others think that these easy and unlabored pages were the result
of incredible effort and toU.’”</p>
<p>Ten of Archimedes’ works survive, after many adventures in Europe and
Arabia, (i) The Method explains to Eratosthenes, with whom he had formed
a friendship in Alexandria, how mechanical experiments can extend
geometrical knowledge. This essay ended the ruler-and-compass reign of
Plato and opened the door to experimental methods; even so it reveals
the different mood of ancient and modem science: the one tolerated
practice for the sake of theoretical understanding, the other tolerates
theory for the sake of possible practical re- sults. (2) A Collection of
Lemmas discusses fifteen “choices,” or alternative hypotheses, in plane
geometry. (3) The Measurement of a Circle arrives at a value between 3%
and 3^%i for it — the ratio of the circumference to the diame- ter of a
circle — and “squares the circle” by showing, through the method of ex -
haustion, that the area of a circle equals that of a right-angled
triangle whose perpendicular equals the radius, and whose base equals
the circumference, of the circle. (4) The Quadrature of the Parabola
studies, by a form of integral cal- culus, the area cut off from a
parabola by a chord, and the problem of fin ding</p>
<p>THE LIFE aF GREECE</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>he area of an ellipse. (5) On Spirals defines a spiral as the figure
made by a point moving from a fixed point at a uniform rate along a
straight line which is revolving in a plane at a uniform rate about the
same fixed point; and finds the area enclosed by a spiral curve and two
radii vectores by methods approximating differential calculus. (6) The
Sphere and the Cylinder seeks formulas for the volume and surface area
of a pyramid, a cone, a cylinder, and a sphere. (7) On Conoids and
Spheroids studies the solids generated by the revolution of conic
sections about their axes. (8) The Sand-Reckoner passes from geometry to
arithmetic, almost to logarithms, by suggesting that large numbers may
be repre- sented by multiples, or “orders,” of 10,000; by this method
Archimedes expre sses the number of grains of sand which would be needed
to fill the universe — assum- ing, he genially adds, that the universe
has a reasonable size. His conclusion, which anyone may verify for
himself, is that the world contains not more than sixty-thr ee “ten -
million units of the eighth order of numbers”— or, as we should put it,
io“. References to lost works of Archimedes indicate that he had also
discovered a way of finding the square root of nonsquare numbers. (9) On
Plane Equilibriums applies geometry to mechanics, studies the center of
gravity of various bodily configurations, and achieves the oldest extant
formulation of scientific statics. (10) On Floating Bodies founds
hydrostatics by arriving at mathematical formulas for the position of
equilibrium of a floating body. The work begins with the then startling
thesis that the surface of any liquid body at rest and in equilibrium is
spherical, and that the sphere has the same center as the earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps ALTchimedes was led to the study of hydrostatics by an
incident almost as famous as Newton’s apple. King Hieron had given to a
Syracusan Cellini some gold to be formed into a crown. When the crown
was de- livered it weighed as much as the gold; but some doubt arose
whether the artist had made up part of the weight by using silver,
keeping the saved gold for himself. Hieron turned over to Archimedes his
suspicion and the crown, presumably stipulating that the one should be
resolved without injuring the other. For weeks Archimedes puzzled over
the problem. One day, as he stepped into a tub at the public baths, he
noticed that the water overflowed according to the depth of his
immersion, and that his body appeared to weigh — or press downward —
less, the more it was submerged. His curious mind, exploring and
utilizing every experience, suddenly for- mulated the “principle of
Archimedes”— that a floating body loses in weight an amount equal to the
weight of the water which it displaces. Surmising that a submerged body
would displace water according to its volume, and perceiving that this
principle offered a test for the crown, Archimedes (if we may beUeve the
staid Vitruvius) dashed out naked into the street and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVUl) THE CLIMAX OF GREEK SCIENCE 63I</p>
<p>rushed to his dwelling, crying out ^‘’Eureka! eurekaP’ —  have found
it! I have found it! Home, he soon dis^:overed that a given weight of
silver, since it had more volume per weight than gold, displaced more
water, when immersed, than an equal weight of gold. He observed also
that the sub- merged crown displaced more water than a quantity of gold
equaling the crown in weight. He concluded that the crown had been
alloyed with some metal less dense than gold. By replacing gold vsdth
silver in the gold weight which he was using for comparison, until the
compound displaced as much water as the crown, Archimedes was able to
say just how much silver had been used in the crown, and how much gold
had been stolen.</p>
<p>That he had satisfied the curiosity of the King did not mean so much
to him as that he had discovered the law of floating bodies, and a
method for measuring specific gravity. He made a planetarium
representing the sun, the earth, the moon, and the five planets then
known (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury), and so arranging them
that by turning a crank one could set all these bodies in motions
differing in direction and speed;’ but he probably agreed with Plato
that the laws that govern the movements of the heavens are more
beautiful than the stars.* In a lost treatise partly preserved in
summaries, Archimedes so accurately formulated the laws of the lever and
the balance that no advance was made upon his work until A.D. 1 586.
“Commensurable magnitudes,” said Proposition VI, “will balance at
distance s inversely proportional to their gravities”’— a useful truth
whose brilliant simplification of complex relationships moves the soul
of a scientist as the Hermes of Praxiteles moves the artist. Almost
intoxicated with the vision of power which he saw in the lever and the
pulley, Archimedes an- nounced that if he had a fixed fulcrum to work
with he could move any- thing: “Pa bo, kai tan gan kino^’ he is reported
to have said, in the Doric dialect of Syracuse: “Give me a place to
stand on, and I will mo ve the earth.”’ Hieron challenged him to do as
well as say, and pointed to the difficulty which his men were
experiencing in beaching a large ship in the royal fleet. Archimedes
arranged a series of cogs and pulleys in such wise that he alone,
sitting at one end of the mechanism, was able to draw the fully loaded
vessel out of the water onto the land.”</p>
<p>Delighted with this demonstration, the King asked Archimedes to
design some engines of war. It was characteristic of the two men that
Archimedes,</p>
<p>• Cicero saw the apparatus two centuries later, and marveled at its
complex synchronism. “When Gallus moved the globe,” he writes, “it was
actually true that the moon was always</p>
<p>&lt;532 the life of GREECE (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>Xhaving designed them, forgot them, and that Hieron, loving peace,
never used them. Archimedes, says Plutarch,</p>
<p>possessed so high a spirit, so profound a soul, and such treasures of
scientific knowledge, that though these inventions had now obtained for
him the renown of more than human sagacity, he yet would not deign to
leave behind him any writing on such subjects; but, repudi- ating as
sordid and ignoble… every sort of art that lends itself to</p>
<p>mere use and profit, he placed his whole affection and ambition
in</p>
<p>hose purer speculations where there can be no reference to the</p>
<p>vulgar needs of life — studies whose superiority to all others is
unques- tioned, and in which the only doubt can be whether the beauty
and grandeur of the subjects examined, or the precision and cogency
of</p>
<p>he methods and means of proof, most deserve our admiration.“</p>
<p>But when Hieron was dead Syracuse became embroiled with Rome, and the
doughty Marcellus assailed it by land and sea. Though Archimedes was now
(212) a man of seventy-five, he superintended the defense on both
fronts. Behind the walls that protected the harbor he set up catapults
able to hurl heavy stones to a considerable distance; their rain of
projectiles was so devastating that Marcellus retreated until he could
advance by night. But when the ships were seen near the shore the
sailors were harassed by bowmen who shot at them through the holes that
Archimedes’ aides had pierced in the wall. Moreover, the inventor had
arranged within the walls great cranes which, when the Roman vessels
came within reach, were turned by cranks and pulleys so as to drop upon
the ships heavy weights of stone or lead that sank many of them. Other
cranes, armed with gigantic hooks, grasped vessels, lifted them into the
air, dashed them against the rocks, or plunged them end-foremost into
the sea.<em>“ Marcellus withdrew his fleet, and put his hopes in an
attack by land. But Archimedes bombarded the troops with large stones
thrown by catapults to such effect that the Romans fled, saying that
they were being opposed by gods; and they refused to ad- vance
again.’</em> “Such a great and marvelous thing,” comments Polybius,
“does the genius of one man show itself to be when properly applied. The
Romans, strong both by sea and by land, had every hope of capturing the
town at once if one old man of Syracuse were removed; as long as he was
present they did not venture to attack.””</p>
<p>Abandoning the idea of taking Syracuse by storm, Marcellus
resigned</p>
<p>• Lucian is our earliest, and not quite reliable, authority for the
story that Archimedes set Roman ships on fire by concentrating die sun’s
rays upon them through the use of great concave mirrors.^</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIIl) THE CLIMAX OF GREEK SCIENCE 633</p>
<p>himself to a slow blockade. After a siege of eight months the
starving city surrendered. In the slaughter and pillage that followed
Marcellus gave orders that Archimedes should not be injured. During the
sack a Roman soldier came upon an aged Syracusan absorbed in studying
figures that he had traced in the sand. The Roman commanded him to
present himself at once to Marcellus. Archimedes refused to go until he
had worked out his problem; he “earnestly besought the soldier,” says
Plutarch, “to wait a little while, that he might not leave what he was
at work upon inconclusive and imperfect, but the soldier, nothing moved
by this entreaty, instantly killed him.”“ When Marcellus heard of it he
mourned, and did everything in his power to console the relatives of the
dead man.” The Roman general erected to his memory a handsome tomb, on
which was engraved, in ac- cordance with the mathematician’s expressed
wish, a sphere within a cylin - der; to have found formulas for the area
and volume of these figures was, in Archimedes’ view, the supreme
achievement of his life. He was not far wrong; for to add one
significant proposition to geometry is of greater value to humanity than
to besiege or defend a city. We must rank Archi- medes with Newton, and
credit him with “a sum of mathematical achieve - ment unsurpassed by any
one man in the world’s history.””</p>
<p>But for the abundance and cheapness of slaves Archimedes might have
been the head of a veritable Industrial Revolution. A treatise on
Mechamcal Problems wrongly attributed to Aristotle, and a Treatise on
Weights wrongly ascribed to Euclid, had laid down certain elementary
principles of statics and dynamics a century before Archimedes. Strato
of Lampsacus, who succeeded Theophrastus as head of the Lyceum, turned
his deter- ministic materialism to physics, and (about 280) formulated
the doctrine that “nature abhors a vacuum.”” When he added that “a
vacuum can be created by artificial means,” he opened the way to a
thousand inventions. Ctesibius of Alexandria (ca. 200) studied the
physics of siphons (which had been used in Egypt as far back as 1500
b.c.), and developed the force pump, the hydraulic organ, and the
hydraulic clock. Archimedes probably impr&lt; 5 ved — and unwittingly
gave his name to — the ancient Egyptian water screw, which literally
made water flow uphill.” Philon of Byzantium, ab out 150, invented
pneumatic machines, and various engines of war.” The steam engine of
Heron of Alexandria, which came after the Roman con- quest of Greece,
brought this period of mechanical development to a climax and close. The
philosophical tradition was too strong; Greek thought went back to
theory, and Greek industry contented itself with slaves. The</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>634</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>Greeks were acquainted with the magnet, and the electrical properties
of amber, but they saw no industrial possibilities in these curious
phenomena. Antiquity unconsciously decided that it was not worth while
to be modem. HI. ARISTARCHUS, HIPPARCHUS, ERATOSTHENES</p>
<p>Greek mathematics owed its Hellenistic stimulus and blossoming to
Egypt, Greek astr onomy to Babylon. Alexander’s opening of the East led
to a resumption and extension of that trade in ideas which, three
centuries earlier, had assisted at the birth of Greek science in Ionia.
To this fresh contact with Egypt and the Near East we may ascribe the
anomaly of Greek science reaching its height in the Hellenistic age,
when Greek litera- ture and art were in decline.</p>
<p>Aristarchus of Samos was a bright interregnum in the mle of the geo-
centric theory over Greek astronomy. He burned with such zeal that he
studied almost all its branches, and achieved distinction in many of
them.“ In his only extant treatise. On the Sizes and Distances of the
Sun and the Moon* there is no hint of heliocentricism; on the contrary
it assumes that the sun and the moon move in circles about the earth.
But Archimedes’ Sand- Reckoner explicitly credits Aristarchus with the
“hypothesis that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved; the earth
revolves about the sun in the circumference of a circle, the sun lyin g
in the middle of the orbit”;** and Plutarch reports that Cleanthes the
Stoic held that Aristarchus should be indicted for “putting the Hearth
of the Universe” (i.e., the earth) “in motion.”** Seleucus of Seleucia
defended the heliocentric view, but th e opinion of the Greek scientific
world decided against it. Aristarchus himself seems to have abandoned
his hypothesis when he failed to reconcile it with the supposedly
circular movements of the heavenly bodies; for all Greek astronomers
took it for granted that these orbits were circular. Perhaps a distaste
for hemlock moved Aristarchus to be the Galileo as well as the
Copernicus of the ancient world.</p>
<p>It was the misfortune of Hellenistic science that the greatest of
Greek astronomers attacked the heliocentric theory with arguments that
seemed</p>
<p>• Aristarchus estimated the volume of the sun as three hundred (it is
over a million) times that of the earth — an estimate that seems low to
us, but would have astonished Anaxagoras or Epicurus. He calculated the
diameter of the moon as one ^ird that of the earth — an error of eight
per cent — and our distance from the sun as twenty (it is almost four
hundred) times</p>
<p>our distance from the moon. “When the sun is totally eclipsed,” reads
one proposition, “th e sun and the moon are then comprehended by one and
the same cone, which has its vertex at our eye.”“</p>

<p>irrefutable before Copernicus. Hipparchus of Nicaea (in Bithynia),
despite what seems to us an epoch-making blunder, was a scientist of the
highest type — endlessly curious to know, devotedly patient in research,
and so carefully accurate in observation and report that antiquity
called him “the lover of truth.”” He touched and adorned nearly every
fiel d of astrono- my, and fixed its conclusions for seventeen
centuries. Only one of his many works remains — a commentary on the
fhainomena of Eudoxus and Axatus of Soli; but we know him from Claudius
Ptolemy’s Almagest (ca. a.d. 140), which is based upon his researches
and calculations; “Ptolemaic astronomy” should be called Hipparchian. He
improved, probably on Babylonian models, the astrolabes and quadrants
that were the chief astronomical instru- ments of his time. He invented
the method of determining terrestrial posi- tions by lines of latitude
and longitude, and tried to organize the astrono- mers of the
Mediterranean world to make observations and measurements that would fix
in these terms the location of all important cities; political distur
bances frustrated the plan until Ptolemy’s more orderly age. His
mathematical studies of astronomic relations led Hipparchus to formulate
a table of sines, and thereby to create the science of trigonometry.
Helped, no doubt, by the cuneiform records which had been brought from
Baby- lonia, he determined with approximate accuracy the length of the
solar, lunar, and sidereal years. He reckoned the solar year as 365 ^
days minus 4 minutes and 48 seconds — an error of 6 minutes according to
current calcu- lations. His time for a mean lunar month was 29 days, 1 2
hours, 44 minutes, and 2*4 seconds — less than a second away from the
accepted figure.” He computed, with impressive approxiniation to modem
measurements, the synodic periods of the planets, the obliquity of the
ecliptic and of the moon’s orbit, the apogee of the sun, and the
horizontal parallax of the moon.” He estimated the distance of the moon
from the earth as 250,000 mUes — an error of only five per cent.</p>
<p>Armed with all this knowledge, Hipparchus concluded that the geocen-
tric view better explained the data than did the hypothesis of
Aristarchus; the heliocentric theory could not stand mathematical
analysis except by supposing an elliptical orbit for the earth, and this
supposition was so un- congenid to Greek thought that even Aristarchus
does not appear to have considered it. Hipparchus verged upon it by his
theory of “eccentrics,” which accounted for the apparent irregularities
in the orbital velocities of the sun and the moon by suggesting that the
centers of the solar and lunar orbits were slightly to one side of the
earth. So near did Hipparchus come</p>

<p>o being the greatest theorist, as well as the greatest observer,
among ancient astronomers.</p>
<p>Watching the sky night after night, Hipparchus was surprised one eve-
ning by the appearance of a star where he was sure there had been none
before. To certify later changes he made, about 129 b.c., a catalogue, a
map, and a globe of the heavens, giving the positions of 1080 fixed
stars in terms of celestial latitude and longitude — an immense boon to
subsequent students of the sky. Comparing his chart with that which
Timochares had made 166 years before, Hipparchus calculated that the
stars had shifted their apparent position some two degrees in the
interval. On this basis he made the subtlest of his discoveries* — the
precession of the equinoxes — the slight advance, day by day, of the
moment when the equinoctial points come to the meridian, f He calculated
the precession as thirty-six seconds per year; the current estimate is
fifty.</p>
<p>We have displaced from his chronological position between Aristarchus
and Hipparchus a scholar whose ecumenical erudition won him the nick-
names of Pentathlos and because he attained distinction in many
fields,</p>
<p>and ranked second only to the best in each. Tradition gave
Eratosthenes of Gyrene exceptional teachers: Zeno the Stoic, Arcesilaus
the skeptic, Cal- limachus the poet, Lysanias the grammarian. By the age
of forty his repu- tation for varied knowledge was so great that Ptolemy
III made him head of the Alexandrian Library. He wrote a volume of
verse, and a history of comedy. His Chronographia sought to determine
the dates of the major events in Mediterranean history. He wrote
mathematical monographs, and devised a mechanical method for finding
mean proportions in continued proportion between two straight lines. He
measured the obliquity of the ecliptic at 23® 5 1 ’, an error of one
half of one per cent. His greatest achieve- ment was his calculation of
the earth’s circumference as 24,662 miles;” we compute it at 24,847.

<p>The equinoxes (lit., equal nights) are those two days of the year
when the sun in its annual apparent motion crosses the equator northward
(our vernal, Argentina’s autumnal, equinox), or southward (our autumnal
equinox), making day and night equal for a day. The equinoctial points
are those points in the sky where the equator of the celestial sphere
inter- sects the ecliptic.</p>

<p>nected the two cities, he concluded that an arc of 7 Vz “ on the
earth’s cir - cumference equaled five hundred miles, and that the entire
circumference would equal 360-7-7.5X500, or 24,000 miles.</p>
<p>Having measured the earth, Eratosthenes proceeded to describe it. His
Geogra^ica brought togethe r the reports of Alexander’s surveyors, of
travelers like Megasthenes, voyagers like Nearchus, and explorers like
Pytheas of Massalia, who, about 320, had sailed around Scotland to Nor-
way, and perhaps to the Arctic Circle.” Eratosthenes did not merely
depict the physical features of each region, he sought to explain them
through the action of water, fire, earthquake, or volcanic eruption.” He
bade the Greeks abandon their provincial division of mankind into
Hellenes and barbarians; men should be divided not nationally but
individually; many Greeks, he thought, were scoundrels, many Persians
and Hindus were refined, and the Romans had shown a greater aptitude
than the Greeks for social order and competent government.” He knew
little of northern Eu rope or northern Asia, less of India south of the
Ganges, nothing of south Africa; but he was, so far as we know, the
first geographer to mention the Chinese. “If,” said another significant
passage, “the extent of the Atlantic Ocean were not an obstacle, we
might easily pass by sea from Iberia (Spain) to India, keeping in the
same parallel.”“</p>

<p>Zoology never rose again in antiquity to the level that it had
reached in Aris- tode’s History of Animals. Probabl y by an agreed
division of labor his successor Theophrastus wrote a classic treatise.
The History of Plants, and a more theo- retical discussion called The
Causes of Plants. TTieophrastus loved gardening, and knew every aspect
of his subject. In many ways he was more scientific than his master,
more careful of his facts, and more orderly in his exposition; a book
without classification, he said, was as untrustworthy as an unbridled
horse.” He</p>

tom off, a branch, a twig, pieces of wood cut up small, or from the
trunk itself.”“ He had no clear idea of sexual reproduction in plants,
except in a few species like the fig tree or the date palm; here he
followed the Babylonians in describing fertiliza- tion and
caprification. He discussed the geographical distribution of plants,
their industrial uses, and the climatic conditions most conducive to
their health. He</p>
<p>638 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Studied the minutiae of half a thousand species with an accuracy of
detail aston- ishing in an age that had no microscope. Twenty centuries
before Goethe he recognized that the flower is a metamorphosed leaf He
was a naturalist in more ways than one, stoutly rejecting the
supernatural explanations current in his day for certain curiosities of
botany He had all the inquisitiveness of a scientist, and did not think
it beneath his dignity as a philosopher to write monographs on stones,
minerals, weather, winds, weariness, geometry, astronomy, and the physi-
cal theories of the pre- Socratic Greeks.“ “If there had been no
Aristotle,” says Sarton, “this period would have been called the time of
Theophrastus.”“</p>
<p>Theophrastus’ ninth “book” summarized all that the Greeks knew about
the</p>
<p>Herophilus of Chalcedon, working at Alexandria about 285, dissected
the eye and gave a good account of the retina and the optic nerves. He
dissected the brain, described the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the
meninges, left his name in the torcular Herophili,* and restored the
brain to honor as the seat of thought. He understood the role of the
nerves, originated their division into sensory and motor, and separated
the cranial from the spinal nerves. He distinguished arteries from
veins, discerned the function of the arteries as carrying blood from the
heart to various parts of the body, and in effect discovered the
circulation of the blood nineteen centuries before Harvey.“ Following a
suggestion of the Goan physician Praxagoras, he included the taking of
the pulse in diagnosis, and used a water clock to measure its frequency.
He dissected and described the ovaries, the uterus, the seminal
vesicles, and the prostate gland; he studied the liver and the pancreas,
and gave to the duodenum the name that it still bears.“ “Science and
art,” wrote Herophilus, “have nothing to show, strength is incap - able
of effort, wealth is useless, and eloquence is powerless, where there is
no health.”“</p>
<p>Herophilus was, so far as we can now judge, the greatest anatomist of
an- tiquity, and Erasistratus was the greatest physiologist. Bom in
Ceos, Erasistratus studied in Athens, and practiced medicine in
Alexandria about 258 b.c. He dis-</p>

</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE CLIMAX OF GREEK SCIENCE 639</p>
<p>inguished more carefully than Herophilus between cerebrum and
cerebellum, and made experiments on living subjects to study the
operation of the brain. He described and explained the working of the
epiglottis, the lacteal vessels of the mesentery, and the aortic and
pulmonary valves of the heart. He had some no- tion of basal metabolism,
for he devised a crude respiration calorimeter.“ Every organ, said
Erasistratus, is connected with the rest of the organism in three ways —
by artery, vein, and nerve. He sought to account for all physiological
phenomena by natural causes, rejecting any reference to mystical
entities. He discarded the humoral theory of Hippocrates, which
Herophilus had retained. He conceived the art of medicine as prevention
through hygiene rather than as cure through therapy; he opposed the
frequent use of drugs and bloodletting, and relied upon diet, bathing,
and exercise.“</p>
<p>Such men made Alexandria the Vienna of the ancient medical world. But
there were great schools of medicine also at Tralles, Miletus, Ephesus,
Per- gamum, Taras, and Syracuse. Many cities had a municipal medical
service; the physicians so employed received a modest salary, but were
honored for making no distinction between rich and poor, free and slave,
and for devoting themselves to their work at any time and risk.
Apollonius of Miletus fought the plague in near-by islands without
reward; when all the doctors of Cos were laid low by an epidemic which
they had labored to control, others came to their rescue from
neighboring towns. Many public decrees of gratitude were issued to
Hellenistic physicians; and though ancient jests railed at mercenary
incompetence, the great profession kept high that standard of ethics
which had come down to it from Hippocrates as its most precious
inheritance.</p>
