<h4 id="chapter-xiv-science-and-philosophy">CHAPTER XIV Science and
Philosophy</h4>
<p>under Napoleon</p>
<p>I. MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS</p>
<p>I N science the age of Napoleon was one of the most fruitful in
history.</p>
<p>He himself was the first modern ruler with a scientific education;
and probably Aristotle’s Alexander had not received so thorough a
grounding. The Franciscan friars who taught him in the military school
at Brienne knew that science is more helpful than theology in winning
wars; they gave the young Corsican all the mathematics, physics,
chemistry, geology, and geog- raphy that they knew. Arrived at power, he
restored Louis XIV’s practice of awarding substantial prizes for
cultural achievements, and he revealed his background by giving most
awards to scientists. Again following precedent, he extended his gifts
to foreigners; so, in 1801, he and the Institute invited Alessandro
Volta to come to Paris and demonstrate his theories of the elec- tric
current; Volta came; Napoleon attended three of his lectures, and moved
the award of a gold medal to the Italian physicist. 1 In 1808 the prize
for electrochemical discoveries was given to Humphry Davy, who came to
Paris to receive it, though France and England were at war. 2
Periodically Napoleon invited the scientists of the Institute to meet
with him and report on work done or in progress in their respective
fields. At such a conference, on February 26, 1808, Cuvier spoke as the
Institute’s secretary, with almost the classic eloquence of a Buffon,
and Napoleon could feel that the Golden Age of French prose had been
restored.</p>
<p>The French excelled in pure science, and made France the most
intellec- tual and skeptical of nations; the English encouraged applied
science, and developed the industry, commerce, and wealth that made them
the pro- tagonists of world history during the nineteenth century. In
the first decade of that century Lagrange, Legendre, Laplace, and Monge
set the pace in mathematics. Monge developed with Napoleon a warm
friendship that lasted till death. He regretted the deterioration of the
consul into an emperor, but bore it with indulgence, and even consented
to be made Comte de Peluse; perhaps it was a secret between them that
Pelusium was an ancient ruin in Egypt. He mourned when Napoleon was
banished to Elba, and openly re- joiced over th e exile’s dramatic
return. The restored Bourbon ordered the Institute to expel Monge; it
obeyed. When Monge died (1818) his stu- dents at the £cole Polytechnique
(which he had helped to establish) wished to attend his funeral, but
were forbidden; the day after his funeral they marched in a body to the
cemetery, and laid a wreath upon his grave.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY,</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>Lazare Carnot came under the influence of Monge when studying in the
military academy at Mezieres. After serving as “organizer of victory” on
the Committee of Public Safety, and escaping with his life from the
radical coup d’etat of September 4, 1797, he found safety and sanity in
mathematics. In 1803 he published Reflexions sur la metaphysique du
calcul infinitesimal; and two later essays founded synthetic geometry. —
In 1 806 Fran§ois Mol- lien made a revolution of his own by introducing
double-entry bookkeeping in the Bank of France. — In 1812 Jean- Victor
Poncelet, a pupil of Monge, joined the Grand Army in the invading of
Russia, was captured, and adorned his imprisonment by formulating, at
the age of twenty-four, the basic the- orems of projective geometry.</p>
<p>Mathematics is both the mother and the model of the sciences: they
begin with counting, and aspire to equations. Through such quantitative
state- ments physics and chemistry guide the engineer in remaking the
world; and sometimes, as in a temple or a bridge, they may flower into
art. Joseph Fourier was not content with administering the departement
of Isere (1801); he wished also to reduce the conduction of heat to
precise mathe- matical formulations. In epochal experiments at Grenoble
he developed and used what are now the “Fourier Series” of differential
equations— still vital to mathematics and a mystery to historians. He
announced his discoveries in 1807, but gave a formal exposition of his
methods and results in Theorie analytique de la chaleu r (1822), which
has been called “one of the most im - portant books published in the
nineteenth century.” 3 Wrote Fourier:</p>
<p>The effects of heat are subject to constant laws which cannot be
discovered without the aid of mathematical analysis. The object of the
theory which we are to explain is to demonstrate these laws; it reduces
all physical researches on the propagation of heat to problems of the
integral calculus whose elements are given by experiment…. These
considerations present a singular example of the relations which exist
between the abstract science of numbers and natural causes. 4</p>
<p>More spectacular were the experiments that Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac
made to measure the effects of altitude on terrestrial magnetism and the
expansion of gases. On September 16, 1804, he rose in a balloon to a
height of 23,012 feet. His findings, reported to the Institute in
1805-09, placed ram among the founders of meteorology; and his later
studies of potassium, chlo- rine, and cyanogen continued the work of
Lavoisier and Berthollet in bring- ing theoretical chemistry to the
service of industry and daily life.</p>
<p>The most impressive figure in the physical sciences of Napoleon’s
reign was</p>
<p>1825), he summoned the developments of mathematics and physics to
the</p>
<p>324 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>ask of subjecting the solar system — and, by implication, all other
heavenly bodies — to the laws of motion and the principle of
gravitation.</p>
<p>Newton had admitted that some seeming irregularities in the movements
of the planets had defied all his attempts to explain them. For example,
the orbit of Saturn was continually, however leisurely, expanding, so
that, if unchecked, it must, in the course of a few billion years, be
lost in the infinity of space; and the orbits of Jupiter and the moon
were slowly shrinking, so that, in the amplitude of time, the great
planet must be absorbed into the sun, and the modest moon must be
catastrophically received into the earth. Newton had concluded that God
himself must intervene, now and then, to correct such absurdities; but
many astronomers had rejected this desperate hypothesis as outlawed by
the nature and principles of science. Laplace pro- posed to show that
these irregularities were due to influences that corrected themselves
periodically, and that a little patience — in Jupiter’s case, 929 years
— would see everything automatically returning to order. He concluded
that there was no reason why the solar and stellar systems should not
continue to operate on the laws of Newton and Laplace to the end of
time.</p>
<p>It was a majestic and dismal conception — that the world is a
machine, doomed to go on tracing the same diagrams in the sky forever.
It had im- mense influence in promoting a mechanistic view of mind as
well as matter, and shared with the kindly Darwin in undermining
Christian theology; God, as Laplace told Napoleon, wasn’t necessary
after all. Napoleon thought the hypothesis somewhat nebulous, and
Laplace himself came at times to doubt Laplace. Midway in his stellar
enterprise he stopped to write a Tbeorie analytique des probability
(1812-20) and an Essai philosophique sur les probability (1814). Nearing
his term, he reminded his fellow scientists: “That which we know is a
little thing; that which we do not know is im - mense.” 6</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MEDICINE</li>
</ol>
<p>The doctors might have said the same, with Napoleon’s hearty consent.
He never gave up hope of convincing his physicians that their drugs had
done more harm than good, and that they would have more deaths to answer
for, at the Last Judgment, than the generals. Dr. Corvisart, who loved
him, heard his banter patiently; Dr. An- tommarchi avenged and deserved
Napoleon’s taunts by giving him — then approaching death — one enema
after another. That Napoleon appreciated the work of devoted and
competent physicians is evident from his bequest of 100,000 francs to
Dominique Larrey (1766- 1842), the “virtuous” surgeon who accompanied
the French army in Egypt, Russia, and at Waterloo, introduced the
“flying ambulance” to give quick aid to the wounded, performed two
hundred amputations in one day at Borodino, and left four volumes of
Memoires de chirurgie militaire et campagnes ( 1812-17). 5a</p>
<p>The Emperor was not mistaken when he chose Jean-Nicolas Corvisart as
his per- sonal physician. The professor of practical medicine at the
College de France was as careful in his diagnoses as he was skeptical of
his treatments. He was the first French doctor to adopt percussion —
chest tapping — as a diagnostic aid in ailments of the heart</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>3 2 5</p>
<p>or lungs. He had found this method proposed in Inventum novum ex
Percussione (1760) of Leopold Auenbrugger of Vienna; he translated the
95-page monograph, added to it from his own experience, and expanded it
into a textbook of 440 pages. 6 His Essai sur les maladies et les
lesions organiques dn coeur et des gros vaisseaux (1806) established him
as one of the founders of pathological anatomy. A year later he joined
the imperial household as its resident physician. His difficult employer
used to say that he had no faith in medicine, but full faith in
Corvisart. 7 When Napoleon went to St. Helena Corvisart withdrew into
rural obscurity, and he died faithfully in the year of his master’s
death (1821).</p>
<p>His pupil Rene-Theophile Laennec carried further the experiments in
auscultation (literally, listening), which, in his first attempt,
consisted of two cylinders, each placed one end on the patient’s body,
the other end at the ear of the doctor, who was thereby “seeing the
chest” ( stethos ) with his ears; so the sounds made by the in ternal
organs — as in breathing, coughing, and digestion — could be heard
unconfused by irrele- vant noise. Helped by this instrument, Laennec
proceeded with investigations whose results he summarized in a Traite de
/’ auscultation mediate (1819); its sec ond edition (1826) has been
described as “the most important treatise on the thoracic organs
ever</p>
<p>The outstanding achievement of French medicine in this period was in
humanizing the treatment of the insane. When, in 1792, Philippe Pinel
was appointed medical di- rector of the famous asylum that Richelieu had
founded at suburban Bicetre, he was shocked to find that the rights of
man so confidently declared by the Revolution had not been extended to
the mentally deranged who were confined there or at a similar
institution, the Salpetriere. Many of the inmates were kept in chains
lest they injure others or themselves; many more were quieted by
frequent bloodletting or by stupe- fying drugs; any new arrival — not
necessarily demented, but perhaps a nuisance to relatives or the
government — was flung into the bedlam and left to deteriorate, by
contagion, in body and mind. The result was a mess of maniacs whose
antics, dull stares, or desperate appeals were occasionally exhibited to
the public for a modest admission fee. Pinel went in person to the
Convention to ask authority for trying a gentler regimen. He removed the
chains, reduced to a minimum the bloodletting and the drugs, released
the patients into the invigorating air, and ordered the guards to treat
the insane not as secret criminals cursed by God but as invalids often
amenable to improvement by patient care. He formulated his views and
regimen in an enduring Traite medico- philosophique sur /’ alienation
mentale (1801). The title was one more sign that Pinel had achieved, or
aimed for, the Hippocratic ideal of the physician as combining the
learning of the scientist with the sympathetic understanding of the
philosopher. “A physician who is a lover of wisdom,” Hippocrates had
said, “is the equal of God.” 10</p>

<li>Cuvier ( )</li>
</ol>
<p>The great Cuvier reached the top of his kind despite being a
Protestant in a Catholic land. Like so many other scientists in
Napoleon’s France, he was raised to high political office, even to
membership in the Council of State (1814); he kept that place under the
restored Bourbons, and was made president of the Council, and a peer of
France, in 1830. When he died</p>
<p>3 26</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<ol start="1832" type="1">
<li>he was honored throughout Europe as the man who had founded
paleontology and comparative anatomy, and had prepared biology to trans-
form the mind of Europe.</li>
</ol>
<p>His father was an officer in a Swiss regiment, who earned an Order of
Merit and at fifty married a young wife. She watched with loving
discipline over the physical and mental development of her son
Georges-Leopold- Chretien; she checked his work as a student, and had
him read to her the classics of literature and history; Cuvier learned
to be eloquent about mol- luscs and worms. He had the good fortune to be
admitted to the Academy that Charles Eugene, duke of Wiirttemberg, had
founded at Stuttgart, where eighty masters taught four hundred select
students. There he was enamored for a time by the works of Linnaeus, but
permanently by the Histoire natu- relle of Buffon.</p>
<p>Having graduated with an armful of prizes, but lacking any patrimony
to finance further schooling, he took a post as tutor in a family living
near Fecamp on the English Channel. Some fossils locally exhumed stirred
his interest in geological strata as literal lithographs of prehistoric
plant and animal life; and some shellfish gathered from the sea so
fascinated him with their diversity of internal organs and external
forms that he proposed a new classification of organisms according to
their structural character and vari- ations. From these beginnings he
developed, by a curiosity and industry that never tired, a knowledge of
fossil and living forms never equaled before him, and perhaps never
since.</p>
<p>News of his learning and application reached Paris, won useful com-
mendations from his future rivals Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Lamarck,
and brought him, aged twenty-seven (1796), the professorship of
comparative anatomy at the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle. At
thirty -one he published one of the classics of French science, Legons
danatomie comparee; at thirty-three he was head professor at the Jardin
des Plantes; at thirty-four he was made “perpetual secretary” (executive
director) of the department of physical and natural sciences in the
Institut National. Meanwhile (1802) he had traveled widely as a
commissioner of the Institute in the reorganiza- tion of secondary
education.</p>
<p>Despite his duties as teacher and administrator, he pursued his
researches as if resolved, with some collaborators, to study and
classify every species of plant or animal preserved in the strata or
living on the earth or in the sea. His Histoire naturelle des poissons (
1828-3 1 ) described five thousand species of fish. His Recherches sur
les ossements fossiles des quadrupedes (1812-25) almost created
mammalian paleontology. It contained Cuvier’s description of the woolly
elephant — named by him the mammoth — whose remains had been found
(1802) buried in a mass of permanently frozen earth in Siberia, and so
well preserved that dogs ate its thawing flesh. 11 In one of these vol-
umes Cuvier explained his principle of the “correlation of parts,” by
which he thought to reconstruct an extinct species from the study of a
single sur- viving bone:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>3 2 7</p>
<p>Every organized individual forms an entire system of its own, all the
parts of which naturally correspond, and concur to produce a certain
definite pur- pose, by reciprocal reaction or by combining toward the
same end. Hence none of these separate parts can change their forms
without a corresponding change in the other parts of the same animal;
and consequently each of these parts, taken separately, indicates all
the other parts to which it has belonged. Thus… if the viscera of an
animal are so organized as to be fitted, only to digest fresh flesh, it
is requisite that the jaws should be so constructed as to fit them for
devouring prey; the teeth, for cutting and devouring its flesh; the
entire system of the limbs, or organs of motion, for pursuing and
overtaking it; and the organs of sense, for discovering it at a distance
In the same man-</p>
<p>ner a claw, a shoulder blade, a condyle, a leg or arm bone, or any
other bone separately considered, enables us to discover the description
of teeth to which they have belonged; and so also reciprocally we may
determine the forms of the other bones from the teeth. Thus, commencing
our investigations by a careful survey of any one bone by itself, a
person who is sufficiently master of the laws of organic structure may,
as it were, reconstruct the whole animal to which that bone belonged.
12</p>
<p>In 1817, in another mammoth work, Le Regne animal distribue d’apres
son organisation, Cuvier summed up his classification of animals into
vertebrates, molluscs, articulates, and radiates, and proposed to
explain the successive strata of fossils as due to the sudden extinction
of hundreds of species by catastrophic convulsions of the earth. As to
the origin of species, he accepted the then orthodox view that each
species had been specifically created by God; that its variations had
been produced by the divine guidance of each organism in its adaptation
to its environment; and that these variations never produced a new
species. On these and other points Cuvier engaged, two years before his
death, in a famous debate which seemed to Goethe the most important
event in the history of Europe in 1830. His living opponent in that
contest was Etienne Geoff roy Saint-Hilaire, who built ms case for the
mutability and natural origin and evolution of species around the work
of a still greater biologist, who had died a year before.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Lamarck ( 1144 - 1829 )</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easy to like Lamarck, for he struggled against poverty in
youth,</p>
<p>against the universally acclaimed Cuvier in maturity, and against
blindness and poverty in old age; moreover, he left behind him a theory
of the causes and methods of evolution much more agreeable to an amiable
disposition than the merciless natural selection offered by the kindly
Darwin.</p>
<p>Like most Frenchmen, he carried a heavy armament of names: Jean-
Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck. He was the elev-
enth child of a martial father, who found military posts for all his
sons except the last; him he sent to a Jesuit college at Amiens, with
instructions to prepare himself for the priesthood. But Jean-Baptiste…
envied his brothers their weapons and steeds; he left college, spent his
allowance on an old horse, and rode off to war in Germany. He fought
valiantly, but his heroic career</p>
<p>328</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>was ended by a neck injury ignominiously received in barrack games.
He went to work as a bank clerk, studied medicine, met Rousseau, was
deflected into botany, pursued plants for nine years, and published in
1778 Flore jrangaise. Then, nearing the end of his economic resources,
he accepted em- ployment as tutor to the sons of Buffon, if only for the
opportunity to meet that aging sage. When Buffon died (1788) Lamarck
took the humble post of keeper of the herbarium in the Jardin du Roi —
the royal botanical gardens in Paris. Soon the designation “of the King”
fell from fashion, and at Lamarck’s suggestion the garden was renamed
Jardin des Plantes. Since it contained also a zoological collection,
Lamarck gave to the study of all living forms the name biologie.</p>
<p>As his interest overflowed from plants to animals, Lamarck, leaving
the vertebrates to Cuvier, took as his province the lowly backboneless
animals, for which he coined the word invertebres (invertebrates). By
1809 he had reached some original views, which he then expounded in
Systeme des ani- maux sans vertebres and in Philosophie zoologique.
Despite failing eyesight, he continued his studies and his writing,
helped by his eldest daughter and by Pierre- Andre Latreille. In 1815-22
he issued his final classifications and conclusions in a voluminous
Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertebres. Thereafter he became
totally blind, and almost destitute. His life was a trib- ute to his
courage, and his old age was a disgrace to his government.</p>
<p>His “philosophy,” or reasoned summary, of zoology began with contem -
plation of the endless and mysteriously originating variety in the forms
of life. Every individual differs from all others, and within any
species we can find so minute a gradation of differences as makes it
difficult, perhaps unjust, to divide a species from its most similar and
kindred neighbors in form and operation. Species, Lamarck concluded
(unwittingly resuming the “concep - tualism” of Abelard), is a c oncept,
an abstract idea; in reality there are only individual beings or things;
and the classes, kinds, or species into which we group them are merely
(though invaluably) intellectual tools for thinking of similar objects
which are, however, incorrigibly unique.</p>
<p>How did these different groups or species of plant or animal life
arise? Lamarck replied with two “laws”:</p>
<p>First Law: In every animal which has not exceeded the term of its
develop- ment, the more frequent and sustained use of any organ
gradually strengthens that organ, develops and enlarges it, and gives it
a strength proportioned to the length of time of such use; while the
constant lack of use of such an organ per- ceptibly weakens it, causing
it to become reduced, progressively diminishes its faculties, and ends
in its disappearance.</p>
<p>Second Law: Everything which nature has caused individuals to acquire
or lose by the influence of the circumstances to which their race may be
for a long time exposed, and consequently by the influence of the
predominant use of such an organ, or by that of the constant lack of use
of such part, it pre- serves by heredity and passes on to the new
individuals which descend from it, provided that the changes thus
acquired are common to both sexes, or to those which have given origin
to these new individuals. 13</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY 329</p>
<p>The first law was obvious: the blacksmith’s arm grows larger and
stronger by use; the neck of the giraffe is elongated by efforts to
reach higher levels of nutritive leaves; the mole is blind because its
underground life makes eyes useless. In later works Lamarck divides his
first law into two complementary elements: the environmental condition
or challenge, and the organism’s need and desire stimulating effort
toward an adaptive response, as by the flow of blood or sap to the organ
used. Here Lamarck tried to meet the difficult question, How do
variations arise? Cuvier replied, Through the direct action of God.
Darwin was to reply, Through “fortuitous variations” whose cause is
unknown. Lamarck replied, Variations arise through the organism’s need,
desire, and persistent effort to meet an environmental condition. This
ex- planation fell in well with the insistence of contemporary
psychologists who stressed the originative action of the will.</p>
<p>But Lamarck’s second law met with a thousand demurrers. Some thought
to refute it by pointing out the lack of hereditary effect in the
circumcision of Semitic foreskins and the compression of Chinese feet;
such cavils, of course, failed to consider that these operations were
external mutilations, not at all involving internal need and effort.
Some other objections failed to allow for the “long time” admittedly
required for an environmental condition to produce a change in the
“race.” With these provisos Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer accepted,
as a factor in evolution, the possible inheritance of “acquired
characters”— i.e., of habits or organic changes developed after birth.
Marx and Engels assumed such heritability, and relied upon a better
environment to produce a natively better man; and the Soviet Union for a
long time made the Lamarckian system a part of its defined creed. About
1885 August Weismann struck a blow at the theory by claiming that the
“germ plasm” (cells carrying the hereditary characters) is immune to
changes in the enveloping body, or somaplasm, and therefore cannot be
affected by postnatal experiences; but tins claim was invalidated when
chromosomes (carriers of heredity) were found in the somatic as well as
the germ cells. Experiments have returned a generally unfavorable report
on the Lamarckian view, 14 but latterly some evidence has been produced
of La- marckian transmission in Faramecium and other protozoa. 15
Perhaps other positive instances would be found if experiments could be
continued upon a longer succession of generations. Our laboratories
suffer from an insuffi- ciency of time; nature does not.</p>

<li>WHAT IS MIND?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lamarck’s emphasis on felt need and consequent effort as factors in
or - ganic response harmonized with the retreat of the Institute’s
psychologists from the view of mind as a completely uninitiative
mechanism of response to external and internal sensations. These
internal explorers used the word “philosophy” as a summary of their
findings; philosophy was not yet quite</p>
<p>33 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>distinct from science; and, indeed, philosophy might be justly termed
a summing up of science if science could successfully apply to mind and
con- sciousness its methods of specific hypothesis, careful observation,
controlled experiment, and mathematical formulation of verifiable
results. That time had not yet come, and the psychologists of the early
nineteenth century con- sidered themselves philosophers as men reasoning
tentatively about matters still beyond the reach and tools of
science.</p>
<p>Despite Napoleon’s opposition, the “ideologues” continued for a
decade</p>
<p>In 1801 he began, and in 1815 completed, publication of his Elements
d’ideologie. He defined this as the study of ideas on the basis of
Condillac’s sensationism — the doctrine that all ideas are derived from
sensations. This, he held, may seem untrue about general or abstract
ideas like virtue, re- ligion, beauty, or man; but in treating such
ideas we should “examine the elementary ideas from which they are
abstracted, and go back to the simple perceptions, to the sensations,
from which they emanate.” 16 Such an objec - tive study, Destutt
thought, could displace metaphysics, and end the reign of Kant. If we
cannot reach a definite conclusion by this method “we must wait, suspend
judgment, and renounce the attempt to explain what we do not really
know.” 17 This tough agnosticism displeased the agnostic Napoleon, who
was at that time arranging a Concordat with the Church. Undeterred,
Destutt classified ideology (psychology) as part of zoology. He defined
consciousness as the perception of sensations; judgment as a sensation
of relations; will as a sensation of desire. As for the idealists who
argued that sensations do not indubitably prove the existence of an
external world, Destutt admitted this concerning sights, sounds, odors,
and tastes; but he insisted that we may certainly conclude to an
external world from our sensa- tions of touch, resistance, and movement.
As Dr. Johnson had said, we can settle the question by kicking a
stone.</p>
<p>In 1803 Napoleon suppressed the Second Class of the Institute, and
Destutt de Tracy found himself without a podium or a printer. Unable to
get per- mission to publish his Commentaire sur UEsprit des Lois de
Montesquieu, he sent the manuscript to Thomas Jefferson, President of
the United States; Jefferson had it translated and printed ( 1 8 1 1 ) ,
without revealing the author’s name. 18 Destutt lived to be eighty-two,
and celebrated his old age by issuing a treatise De V Amour (1826).</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>331</p>
<p>Maine de Biran (Marie-Frangois-Pierre Gonthier de Biran), began his
philosophical career by expounding sensationism with an obscurity that
guaranteed his fame.* He began as a soldier and ended as a mystic. In
1784 he joined the royal Garde du Corps of Louis XVI, and helped to
defend him from the “monstrous regiment of women” 20 besieging King and
Queen at Versailles on October 5-6, 1789. Horrified by the Revo- lution,
he returned to his estate near Bergerac. He was elected to the Corps
Legislatif in 1809, opposed Napoleon in 1813, and became treasurer of
the Chamber of Deputies under Louis XVIII. His writings were asides from
his political career, but they raised him to acknowledged leadership
among the French philosophers of his time.</p>
<p>He stumbled into fame in 1802 by winning first prize in a competition
sponsored by the Institute. His essay L’Influence de Phabitude sur les
facultes de penser seemed to follow the sensationist views of Condillac,
and even the physiological psychology of Destutt de Tracy. “The nature
of the understanding,” he wrote, “is nothing other than the sum of the
principal habits of the central organ, which must be considered as the
universal sense of perception”; 21 and he thought that one might
“suppose in reality each impression represented by the corresponding
movement of a fiber in the b rain.” 22 But as he proceeded he moved away
from the notion that the mind is merely the total of the body’s
sensations; it seemed to him that in efforts of attention or will the
mind was an active and originative factor, not reducible to any
combination of sensations.</p>
<p>This divergence from the ideologues was widened in 1805 with Memoir e
sur la decomposition de la pensee, which chimed in with Napoleon’s
restoration erf religion. The effort of will, Maine de Biran argued,
shows that the soul of man is no passive recycling of sensations; it is
a positive and will-full force which is the very essence of the self;
the will and the ego are one. (Schopenhauer would stress this
voluntarism in 1819, and it would continue in French philosophy and take
brilliant form in Berg- son.) This effortful will is added to the other
factors that determine action, and gives them that “free will” without
which man would be a ridiculous automaton. That in - ternal force is a
spiritual reality, not a conglomerate of sensations and memories. There
is nothing material or spatial about it. Indeed (Maine de Biran
proceeds), prob- ably all force is likewise immaterial, and can be
understood only by analogy with the willful self. From this point of
view Leibniz was right in describing the world as a compound and
battleground of monads each of which is a center of force, will, and
individuality.</p>
<p>Perhaps Maine de Biran’s double life of politics and philosophy,
added to lively participation in weekly meetings at the Institute with
Cuvier, Royer-Collard, Am- pere, Guizot, and Victor Cousin, proved too
arduous; his health broke down; his short life of fifty-eight years was
nearing its close; he turned from mind-stretching speculation to a
tranquilizing religious faith, and at last to a mysticism that raised
him out of this painful world. Man, he said, should progress from the
animal stage of sen- sation through the human stage of free and
conscious will, to an absorption in the consciousness and love of
God.</p>
<p>V. THE CASE FOR CONSERVATISM</p>
<p>The philosophes of the eighteenth century had weakened the French
gov- ernment by impairing the credibility and moral standing of the
Church, and by calling for an “enlightened despotism” to mitigate the
evils of ignorance, incompetence, corruption, oppression, poverty, and
war. The French phi-</p>
<p>“His bad style,” said Taine, “has made him a great man;… if he had
not been obscure we should not have believed him profound.” 19</p>
<p>332</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>losophers of the early nineteenth century replied to these “dreamers”
by defending the necessity of religion, the wisdom of tradition, the
authority of the family, the advantages of legitimate monarchy, and the
constant need of maintaining political, moral, and economic dikes
against the ever-swelling sea of popular ignorance, cupidity, violence,
barbarism, and fertility.</p>
<p>Two men, in this period, drew up in angry detail an indictment of the
eighteenth-century appeal from faith to reason, and from tradition to
en- lightenment. Vicomte Louis-Gabriel-Ambroise de Bonald was born
(1754) to class comfort, and was schooled in a secure and obedient
piety. Astonished and threatened by the Revolution, he emigrated to
Germany, joined for a time the antirevolutionary army of the Prince de
Conde, resented its sui- cidal disorder, and retired to Heidelberg to
carry on the war with his disci- plined pen. In his Theorie du pouvoir
politique et religieux (1796) he de- fended absolute monarchy,
hereditary aristocracy, patriarchal authority in the family, and the
moral and religious sovereignty of the popes over all the kings of
Christendom. The Directory condemned the book, but allowed him to return
to France (1797). After a cautious pause he resumed his philo- sophic
offensive with an Essai analytique sur les lois naturelles de fordre
social ( 1800). Napoleon welcomed its defense of religion as
indispensable to government. He offered Bonald a place in the Council of
State; Bonald re- fused, then accepted (1806), saying that Napoleon had
been appointed by God to restore the true faith. 23</p>
<p>After the Restoration he occupied a succession of public offices, and
issued a succession of conservative pronouncements, fervent but dull. He
opposed divorce and the “rights of women” as disruptive of the family
and social order, condemned freedom of the press as a threat to stable
government, defended censorship and capital punishment, and proposed to
punish with death the profanation of the sacred vessels used in Catholic
services. 24 Some conservatives smiled at the enthusiasm of his
orthodoxy; but he was consoled by his correspondence with Joseph de
Maistre, who, from St. Petersburg, sent him assurances of complete
support, and later published volumes that must have gladdened and
maddened Bonald by the completeness of their conservatism and the
brilliance of their style.</p>
<p>Maistre was born (1753) in Chambery, where, twenty years earlier,</p>
<p>Mme. de Warens had taught Rousseau the art of love. As capital of the
duchy of Savoy, the city was subject to the kings of Sardinia; however,
the Savoyards used French as their native language, and Joseph learned
to write it with almost the verve and force of Voltaire. His father was
president of the Savoy Senate, and he himself became a member in 1787;
they had more than philosophical reasons for defending the status quo.
Politically the son of his father, Joseph was emotionally akin to his
mother, who transmitted to him a passionate loyalty to the Catholic
Church. “Nothing,” he later wrote,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>pletely the Jesuit view that the state should be subordinate to the
Church, and the Church to the pope.</p>
<p>In September, 1792, a French revolutionary army entered Savoy, and in
November the duchy was annexed to France. The shock of this sudden
transvaluation of all values, classes, powers, and creeds left Maistre
with a hatred that darkened his mood, wrote his books, and heated his
style. He fled with his wife to Lausanne, where he survived as official
correspondent for Charles Emmanuel IV, king of Sardinia. He took some
comfort in fre- quenting the salon of Mme. de Stael at nearby Coppet;
but the intellectuals whom he met there, like Benjamin Constant, seemed
to him infected with the scandalous skepticism of eighteenth-century
France. Even the emigres who were huddling in Lausanne were addicts of
Voltaire; Maistre marveled at their unawareness that the
anti-Catholicism of the philosophes had under- mined the whole structure
of French life by weakening the religious sup- ports of the moral code,
the family, and the state. Too old to shoulder arms against the
Revolution, he resolved to fight the unbelievers and the revolu-
tionists with his pen. He mingled vitriol with his ink, and left his
mark upon the century. Only Edmund Burke, in that age, surpassed him in
expounding the conservative view of life.</p>
<p>So in 1796, through a Neuchatel press, he issued Considerations sur
la France. He admitted that the government of Louis XVI had been
vacillating and incompetent, and that the French Church needed moral
renovation; 26 but to change the form, policies, and methods of the
state so rapidly and drastically was to betray an adolescent’s ignorance
of the recondite founda - tions of government. No polity, he believed,
could long survive which lacked roots in tradition and time, or supports
in religion and morality. The French Revolution had shattered those
supports by beheading the King and dispos- sessing the Church. “Never
has such a great crime had so many accomphces…. Each drop of Louis XVI’s
blood will cost France torrents; perhaps four million Frenchmen will pay
with their lives for the great national crime of an antireligious and
antisocial insurrection crowned by regicide.” 27 Soon, he pr edicted (in
1796), “four or five people will give France a king.” 28</p>
<p>In 1797 King Charles Emmanuel summoned Maistre to serve him in Turin;
but shortly thereafter Napoleon took Turin, and the philosopher fled to
Venice. In 1802 he was appointed Sardinian plenipotentiary at the court
of Czar Alexander I. Expecting his mission to be brief, he left his
family be- hind, but the service of his King kept him in St. Petersburg
till 1817. He bore banishment impatiently, and drowned his cares in
manuscript.</p>
<p>His basic production, Essai sur le principe generateur des
constitutions politiques (1810), derived such constitutions from the
conflict, in man, be- tween good and evil (social and unsocial)
impulses, and the need for an orga- nized and lasting authority to
maintain public order and group survival by supporting cooperative, as
against individualistic, tendencies. Every man naturally longs for power
and possession, and, until tamed, is a potential despot, criminal, or
rapist. Some saints control earthly appetites, and a few</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>philosophers may have accomplished this through reason; but in most
of us virtue cannot of itself master our basic instincts; and to let
every supposed adult judge all matters by his own reason (weak through
inexperience, and slave to desire) is to sacrifice order to liberty.
Such undisciplined liberty be- comes license, and social disorder
threatens the power of the group to unite against attack from without or
disintegration from within.</p>
<p>Consequently, in Maistre’s view, the ebullient Enlightenment was a
colos - sal mistake. He compared it to the youth who, by ms eighteenth
year, has concocted or adopted schemes for the radical reconstruction of
education, the family, religion, society, and government. Voltaire was a
choice example of such jejune omniscience; he “talked of everything for
a whole age with - out once piercing below the surface”; he was “so
continually occupied with instructing the world” that he “had only very
rarely time to think.” 29 If he had studied history humbly as a
transitory individual seeking instruction from the experience of the
race, he might have learned that impersonal time is a better teacher
than personal thought; that the soundest test of an idea is its
pragmatic effects in the life and history of mankind; that institutions
rooted in centuries of tradition must not be rejected without careful
weigh- ing of losses agains t gains; and that the campaign to ecraser l’
inf dme— to de- stroy the moral authority of the Church which had
disciplined adolescence and formed social order in Western Europe —
would bring the collapse of morality, the family, society, and the
state. The murderous Revolution was the logical outcome of the blind
“Enlightenment.” “Philosophy is an essen - tially destructive force”; it
puts all its trust in reason, which is individual, in intellect, which
is individualistic; and the liberation of the individual from political
and religious tradition and authority endangers the state, and civili-
zation itself. “Hence the present generation is witnessing one of the
most dramatic conflicts humanity has ever seen: the war to the death
between Christianit y and the cult of philosophy.” 30</p>
<p>Since the individual lives too briefly to be fit to test the wisdom
of tradi- tion, he should be taught to accept it as his guide until he
is old enough to begin to understand it; he will, of course, never be
able to understand it fully. He should be suspicious of any proposed
change in&gt; the constitution or the moral code. He should honor
established authority as the verdict of tradition and racial experience,
and therefore the voice of God. 31</p>
<p>Monarchy — heredity and absolute — is the best form of government,
for it embodies the longest and widest tradition, and makes for order,
continuity, stability, and strength; while democracy, with its frequent
changes in leaders and ideas, its periodical exposure to the whims and
ignorance of the com- monalty, makes for discontent, disorder, reckless
experimentation, and an early end. The art of government includes
mollifying the masses; the suicide of government lies in obeying
them.</p>
<p>Leisurely (1802-16), in his most famous production, Les Soirees de
Suint- Petersbourg (1821); Maistr.e expounded some incidental aspects of
his. phi- losophy. He thought that science proved God, for it -revealed
in nature a majestic order that implied a cosmic intelligence. 32 We
must not be disturbed</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>in our faith by the occasional successes of the wicked or the
misfortunes of the good. God allows good and evil to fall indifferently,
like sun and rain, upon the criminal and the saint, for he is reluctant
to suspend the laws of na- ture; 33 in some cases, however, he may be
moved by prayer to change the incidence of a law. 34 Besides, most evils
are penalties for faults or sins; prob- ably every malady, every pain,
is a punishment for some taint in ourselves, or our ancestry, or our
living group.</p>
<p>If this is so, we should defend corporal punishment, execution for
certain crimes, and even the tortures of the Inquisition. We should
honor the public executioner instead of making him an outcast; his work,
too, is the work of God, and is vital to social order. 35 The
persistence of evil requires the per- sistence of punishme nt; relax
this, and crime will grow. Moreover, “there is no punishment that does
not purify, no disorder which Eternal Love does not turn against the
principle of evil.” 36</p>
<p>“War is divine, since it is a law of the world”— permitted by God
through all history. 37 Wild animals obey this rule. “Periodically an
exterminating angel comes and clears away thousands of them.” 38
“Humanity can be con - sidered as a tree that an invisible hand is
continually pruning, often to its benefit… A great deal of bloodshed is
often connected with a high popu- lation.” 39 “From the worm even to man
there is accomplished the great law of the violent destruction of living
beings. The whole earth, drinking blood, is merely an immense altar,
where every living being must be immolated, time without end, without
limit, without rest, even unto the destruction of all things, even to
the death of death.” 40</p>
<p>If we object that such a world hardly moves us to worship its
creator, Maistre answers that we must worship nonetheless, because all
nations and generations have worshiped him, and so lasting and universal
a tradition must contain a truth beyond the capacity of human reason to
understand or re- fute. In the end, philosophy, if it loves wisdom, will
yield to religion, and reason to faith.</p>
<p>In 1817 the King of Sardinia, restored to his Turin throne, recalled
Maistre from Russia; and in 1818 he made him a chief magistrate and a
councilor of state. In those two years the grim philosopher produced his
last work, Du Pape, which was published soon after his death (1821). The
book was his uncompromising answer to the question that had been raised
by his exalta- tion of the monarch as society’s protection against the
individualism of the citizen: What if the monarch too, like Caesar or
Napoleon, is as individual- istic and self-centered as any citizen, and
much more in love with power?</p>
<p>Maistre unhesitatingly replied that all rulers must accept
subordination to an authority older, greater, and wiser than their own:
they must submit, in all matters of religion or morality, to the verdict
of a pontiff who inherits the power conferred upon the Apostle Peter by
the Son of God. At that time (1821), when the states of Europe were
struggling to recover from the bru- tality of the Revolution and the
despotism of Napoleon, their leaders should recall how the Catholic
Church had saved the remnants of Roman civili- zation by checking and
taming the multiplying barbarians; how she had</p>
<p>33 ^</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>established, through her bishops, a system of social order and
disciplined education which slowly, through the Dark and Middle Ages,
begot a civili- zation based upon the agreement of kings to recognize
the moral sovereignty of the pope. “Nations have never been civilized
except by religion,” for only the fear of an all-seeing and all-powerful
God can control the individualism of human desire. Religion accompanied
the birth of all civilizations, and the absence of religion heralds
their death. 41 Therefore the kings of Europe must again accept the pope
as their overlord in all moral or spiritual concerns. They should take
education out of the hands of scientists and return it to the priests,
for the ascendancy of science will coarsen and brutalize the people , 42
while the restoration of religion will give peace to the nation and the
soul.</p>
<p>But what if the pope too should be selfish, and seek to turn every
issue to the temporal advantage of the Papacy? Maistre had a ready
answer:, since the pope is guided by God, he is infallible when, on
matters of faith or morals, he speaks as official head of the Church
founded by Christ. So, half a cen- tury before the Church herself
proclaimed it as an inseparable part of the Catholic faith, Maistre
announced the infallibility of the pope. The Pope himself was a bit
surprised, and the Vatican found it advisable to check the
“ultramontanists” who were making embarrassing claims for the political
authority of the Papacy.</p>
<p>Barring this final point, and some other exaggerations that could be
passed with a smile, the conservatives of Europe welcomed Maistre’s
uncom - promising defense of their views, and compliments came to him
from Cha- teaubriand, Bonald, Lamennais, and Lamartine. Even Napoleon
agreed with him on a number of items — the benevolence of Louis XVI, the
vileness of the regicides, the excesses of the Revolution, the frailty
of reason, the pre- sumptuousness of the philosophers, the necessity of
religion, the value of tradition and authority, the weaknesses of
democracy, the desirability of hereditary and absolute monarchy, the
biological services of war…</p>
<p>As for Napoleon’s reigning enemies, they could feel that in Maistre’s
straightforward philosophy were some of the reasons why they had to
over- throw this Corsican parvenu, this heir of a revolution that
threatened every monarchy in the world. Here was the secret doctrine
that they had never been able — never would be able — to explain to
their subjects: the reasons why they, the hereditary kings, emperors,
and aristocracies of Europe, had ac- cepted the burdens, dangers, and
ritual of rule, while the Marats, Robes- pierres, and Babeufs had
accused them of mercilessly exploiting an innocent commonalty which
claimed by divine right — really by assassination and mas- sacre — all
the benefits of social organization, and all the goods of the earth.</p>
