<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>The Zenith of Philosophy</p>
<p>I. THE SCIENTISTS</p>
<p>C OMPARED with the bold advance of the fifth century, and the revolu-
tionary achievements of the third, science in the fourth marked time,
and contented itself, in great part, with recording its accumulations.
Xenocrates wrote a history of geometry, Theophrastus a history of
natural philosophy, Menon a history of medicine, Eudemus histories of
arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy.^ The problems of religion, morals,
and politics appearing to be more vital and pressing than the problems
of nature, men turned with Socrates from the objective study of the
material world to a consideration of the soul and the state.</p>
<p>Plato loved mathematics, dipped his philosophy into it deeply,
dedicated the Academy to it, almost, in Syracuse, gave a kingdom for it.
But arithmetic was for him a half-mystical theory of number; geometry
was not a measuring of the earth, it was a discipline of pure reason, a
portal to the mind of God. Plu- tarch tells of Plato’s “indignation” at
Eudoxus and Archytas for carrying on experiments in mechanics, “as the
mere corruption and annihilation of the one good of geometry, which was
thus shamefully turning its back upon the un- embodied objects of pure
intelligence to recur to sensation, and to ask help . . . from matter.”
In this way, Plutarch continues, “Mechanics came to be sepa - rated from
geometry, and, repudiated or neglected by philosophers, took its place
as a military art.”^ Nevertheless, in his own abstract way, Plato served
mathematics well. He redefined the point as the beginning of a line,®
formu- lated a rule for finding square numbers that are the sum of two
squares,* and invented or developed mathematical analysis® — i.e., the
proof or disproof of a proposition by considering the results that
follow from assuming it; the reductio ad absurdum is one form of this
method. The emphasis on mathematics, in the curriculum of the Academy,
helped the science if only by training such crea- tive pupils as Eudoxus
of Cnidus and Heracleides of Pontus.</p>
<p>Plato’s friend Archytas, besides being seven times chosen strategos
of Taras,</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 5OI</p>
<p>third, says the grave Aristotle, “gave children something to occupy
them, and so prevented them from breaking things about the house.”® In
this same age Dinostratus “squared the circle” by using the quadratrix
curve. His brother Menaechmus, a pupil of Plato, founded the geometry of
conic sections,* doubled the cube, formulated the theoretical
construction of the five regular solids,! advanced the theory of
irrational numbers, and gave the world a famous phrase. “O King,” he
said to Alexander, “for tra veling over the country there are both royal
roads and roads for common citizens; but in geometry there is one road
for all.”J®</p>
<p>The great name in fourth-century science is Eudoxus, who helped
Praxiteles to give Cnidus a niche in history. Born there about 408, he
set out at the age of twenty-three to study medicine with Philistion at
Locri, geometry with Archytas at Taras, and philosophy with Plato at
Athens. He was poor, and lived cheaply at the Piraeus, whence he walked
to the Academy every scholastic day. After a stay in Cnidus he went to
Egypt and spent sixteen months study- ing astronomy with the priests of
Heliopolis. We find him next in Propontine Cyzicus, lecturing on
mathematics. At the age of forty he moved with his pupils to Athens,
opened there a school of science and philosophy, and for a time rivaled
Plato. Finally he returned to Cnidus, set up an observatory, and was
entrusted with the task of giving the city a new code of laws.®</p>
<p>His contributions to geometry were fundamental. He invented the
theory of proportion,§ and most of the propositions, transmitted to us
in the fifth book of Euclid; and he devised the method of exhaustion
which made it possible to calculate the area of the circle and the
volume of the sphere, the pyramid, and the cone; without this
preliminary work Archimedes would have been im- possible. But the
absorbing interest of Eudoxus was in astronomy. We catch the spirit of
the scientist in his remark that he would gladly be consumed like
Phaethon if he migh t thereby discover the nature, size, and form of the
sun.“ The word astrology was then used to include what we call
astronomy, but Eudoxus advised his pupils to ignore the Chaldean theory
that a person’s for - tune could be told by noting the position of the
stars at the time of his birth. He longed to reduce aU celestial motions
to fixed laws; and in his Phainomena — which antiquity considered its
greatest book on astronomy — he laid the founda- tion for the scientific
predicton of the weather.</p>
<p>• The Greeks defined conic sections as the figures — ellipse,
parabola, and hyperbola — pro- duced by cutting an acute-angled, a
right-angled, and an obtuse-angled cone with a plane perpendicular to an
element^ Modern mathematics adds the cirqle and intersecting lines.</p>
<p>fThe tetrahedron (pyramid), hexahedron (cube), octahedron,
dodecahedron, and icosa- hedron-convex solids enclosed by four, six,
eight, twelve, or twenty regular polygons.</p>
<p>:|: The Royal Roads, or King’s Highways, usually referred to the
great r oads of the Persian Empire. The story is told also of Euclid and
Ptolemy I.®®</p>
<p>§ One of his favorite problems was to find the “golden section”—
i.e., to divide a line at such a point that the whole line should have
the same proportion to the larger part as the larger to the smaller.</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>His most famous theory was a brilliant failure. He suggested that the
universe was composed of twenty-seven transparent and therefore
invisible spheres, re- volving in diverse directions and at various
speeds about the center of the earth; and that the heavenly bodies were
fixed upon the periphery or shell of these concentric spheres. The
system now seems fantastic, but it was one of the first attempts to give
a scientific explanation of celestial behavior. In accord with it
Eudoxus calculated with considerable accuracy (if we may rashly take our
present “knowledge” of these matters as a norm) the synodic and zodiacal
pe - riods of the planets.* The theory did more than any other in
antiquity to stimulate astronomic research.</p>
<p>Ecphantus of Syracuse wrote, about 390: “The earth moves about its
own center in an eastward direction.”^ Heracleides of Pontus, one of the
great</p>
<p>Meanwhile a modest progress was being made in the sciences. In
geography Dicaearchus of Messana, the biographer of Greece, measured the
height of mountains, established the circumference of the earth at some
thirty thousand miles, and noted the influence of the sun upon the
tides. In 325 Nearchus, one of Alexander’s generals, sailed from the
mouth of the Indus along the southern coast of Asia to the Euphrates;
his log, partly preserved in Arrian’s Indica^ was one of the classics of
ancient geography. Geodesy — the measurement of land surfaces,
elevations, depressions, positions, and volumes — had already been
christened (geodaisia) as distinct from geometry.^® Philistion of
Italian Locri, at the beginning of the century, practiced animal
dissection, and called the heart the main regulator of life, the seat of
the pneuma^ or soul. Diodes of</p>
<p>• The synodic period of a heavenly body is the time between two
successive conjunctions of it with the sun, as seen from the earth; the
zodiacal period is the time between two succes- sive appearances of a
heavenly body in the same part of the sky as imaginatively divided into
the twelve signs of the zodiac. Eudoxus’ figure for the synodic period
of Saturn was 390 days, ours is 378; for Jupiter, 390, ours 399; for
Mars, 260, ours 780; for Mercury, no (one manu- script says 1 16), ours
116; for Venus, 570, ours 584. The zodiacal period given by Eudoxus for
Saturn was 30 years, our figure, 29 years, 166 days; for Jupiter, 12
years, our figure, ii years, 315 days; for Mars, 2 years, our figure, i
year, 322 days; for Mercury and Venus, i year, our figure, i vear.“</p>

<p>503</p>
<p>Euboean Carystus, about 370, dissected the womb of animals, described
human embryos of twenty-seven to forty days, advanced anatomy,
embryology, gyne- cology, and obstetrics, and scotched a favorite Greek
error by announcing that both sexes contribute “seed” to form the
embryo.” A second Aspasia became one of the famous physicians of
fourth-century Athens, renowned for her work in women’s diseases,
surgery, and other branches of medicine.” And lest medi - cal science
should lower the death rate too fast for the means of subsistence,
Aeneas Tacticus, the Arcadian, published about 360, in time for Philip
and Alexander, the first Greek classic on the art of war.</p>

<li>Aristippus</li>
</ol>
<p>If it was a middling age in science the fourth century was the heyday
of philosophy. The early thinkers had propounded vague cosmologies; the
Sophists had doubted everything but rhetoric; Socrates had raised a
thousand questions and answered none; now all the seeds that had been
planted in two hundred years sprouted into great systems of
metaphysical, ethical, and political speculation. Athens, too poor to
maintain its state medical service, nevertheless opened private
universities that made it, as Isocrates said, the “school of Hellas,”
the intellectual capital and arbiter of Greece. Having weakened the old
religion, the philosophers struggled to find in nature and reason some
substitute for it as a prop of morals and a guide to life.</p>
<p>They explored first the paths opened up by Socrates. While the Soph-
ists relapsed for the most part into the teaching of rhetoric, and
disap- peared as a class, the pupils of Socrates became the storm
centers of vio- lently divergent philosophies. Eucleides of Megara, who
had often traveled to Athens to hear Socrates, stirred up his native
city with “a rage of dis - putes,” as Timon of Athens phrased it,” and
developed the dialectic of Zeno and Socrates into an eristic, or art of
argument, that questioned every conclusion, and led in the next century
to the skepticism of Pyrrho and Cameades. After Eucleides’ death his
brilliant disciple Stilpo led the Megarian school more and more towards
the Cynic point of view: since every philosophy can be refuted, wisdom
lies not in metaphysical specu- lation but in such simple living as will
liberate the individual from depend- ence upon the external factors in
well-being. When, after the sack of Megara, Demetrius Poliorcetes
inquired how much Stilpo had lost, the</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>sage replied that he had never possessed anything but knowledge, and
no one had taken this away.* In his later years he numbered among his
stu- dents the founder of the Stoic philosophy, so that the Megarian
school may be said to have begun with one Zeno, and ended with
another.</p>
<p>The elegant Aristippus, after Socrates’ death, trav eled to various
cities, spent some time with Xenophon at Scillus but more with Lais in
Corinth,” and then settled down to found a school of philosophy in his
native Gy- rene, on the coast of Africa. The wealth and luxury of the
upper classes in the half-Oriental city had formed his habits, and he
agreed most with that part of his master’s doctrine which called
happiness the greatest good. Handsome in figure, refined in manners,
clever in speech, he made a way for himself everywhere. Shipwrecked and
penniless in Rhodes, he went to a gymnasium, discoursed, and so
fascinated the men there that they provided him and his companions with
all comforts; whereupon he re- marked that parents should arm their
children with such wealth that even after a shipw reck it should be able
to svifim to land with its owner.”</p>
<p>His philosophy was simple and candid. Whatever we do, said Aristip-
pus, is done through hope of pleasure or fear of pain — even when we im-
poverish ourselves for our friends, or give our lives for our generals.
Therefore, by common consent, pleasure is the ultimate good, and every-
thing else, including virtue and philosophy, must be judged according to
its capacity to bring us pleasure. Our knowledge of things is uncertain;
all that we know directly and surely is our feelings; wisdom, then, lies
in the pursuit not of abstract truth but of pleasurable sensations. The
keen- est pleasures are not intellectual or moral, they are physical or
sensual; therefore the wise man will seek physical delights above all.
Nor will he sacrifice a present good to a conjectural future good; only
the present exists, and the present is probably as good as the future,
if not better; the art of life lies in plucking pleasures as they pass,
and making the most of what the moment gives.” The use of philosophy is
that it may guide us not away from pleasures, but to the most pleasant
choice and use of them. It is not the ascetic who abstains that is
pleasure’s master, but rather the man who enjoys pleasures without being
their slave, and can prudently distinguish between those that endanger
him and those that do not; hence the wise man will show a discriminating
respect for public opinion and the laws, but wOl seek as far as possible
“to be neither the maste r nor the slave of any man.””</p>
<p>If it is a credit to a man that he practices what he preaches,
Aristippus deserves some honor. He bore poverty and riches with equal
grace, but</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 505</p>
<p>made no pretense to impartiality between them. He insisted on being
paid for his instructions, and did not hesitate to flatter tyrants to
gain his end. He smiled patiently when Dionysius I spat upon him: “A
fisherman,” he said, “must put up with more moisture than this to catch
even a smaller fish.”“ When a friend reproached him for kneeling before
Dionysius</p>
<p>he answered that it was not his fault if the King “had his ears in
his feet”; and when Dionysius asked him why philosophers haunt the doors
of the rich, but the rich do not frequent the presence of philosophers,
he replied, “Because the first know what they want but the second do
not.”“ Never - theless he despised men who pursued wealth for its own
sake. When the rich Phrygian Simus displayed to him an ornate house
paved with marble, Aristippus spat in his face; and when Simus protested
he excused himself on the ground that he could not find, amid all this
marble, “a more suit - able place to spit in.”” Having made money, he
spent it lavishly on good food, good clothing, good lodging, and (as
they seemed to him) good women. Being reproved for living with a
courtesan, he answered that he had no objection to living in a house, or
sailing in a ship, that other men had used before him.” When his
mistress said to him, “I am in a family way by you,” he replied, “You
can no more tell that it was I, than you could tell, after going through
a thicket, which thorn had scratched you.””</p>
<p>People liked him despite his honest ways, for he was a person of
pleasant manner, refined culture {pace Simus), and kindly heart.
Doubtless his blunt hedonism was in part due to his delight in
scandalizing the respect- able sinners of the town. He gave himself away
by reverencing Socrates, loving philosophy,* and confessing that the
most impressive spectacle in life is the sight of a virtuous man
steadily pursuing his course in the midst of vicious people.” Before his
death (356) he remarked that the greatest</p>
<p>2 . Diogenes</p>
<p>Antisthenes agreed with the conclusion, but not the arguments, of
this philosophy, and drew out of the same Socrates an ascetic theory of
life.</p>
<p>• Those who omit philosophy from their education, said Aristippus,
“are like the suitors of Penelope; they . . . find it easier to win over
the maidservants than to marry the mistress.”*</p>
<p>5o6</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>The founder of the Cynic school was the son of an Athenian citizen
and a Thracian slave. He fought bravely at Tanagra in 426. He studied
for a time with Gorgias and Prodicus, and then set up his own school;
but having heard Socrates discourse, he went over — taking his pupils
with him — to learn the wisdom of the older man. Like Eudoxus he lived
at the Piraeus, and walked to Athens nearly every day — four or five
miles each way. Perhaps he was present when Socrates (or Plato)
discussed with a complaisant interlocutor the problem of pleasure.</p>
<p>Socr. Do you think that the philosopher ought to care about</p>
<p>the pleasures of . . . eating and drinking?</p>
<p>Sinmias. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Socr. And what do you say of the pleasures of love — should he</p>
<p>care about them?</p>
<p>Sim. By no means.</p>
<p>Socr. And will he think much of the other ways of indulging</p>
<p>the body — for example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or
sandals, or other adornments of the body? Instead of caring about these
does he not rather despise anything beyond what nature needs?</p>
<p>Sim. I should say that the true philosopher would despise them.“</p>
<p>This is the essence of the Cynic philosophy: to reduce the things
of</p>
<p>the flesh to bare necessities in order that the soul may be as free
as possible. Antisthenes took the doctrine literally, and became a Greek
Franciscan without theology. Aristippus’ motto was, “I possess, but am
not possessed”; Antisthenes’ was, “I do not possess, in order not to be
possessed.” He had no property,® and dressed in so ragged a cloak that
Socrates twitted him: “I can see your vanity, Antisthenes, through the
holes of your cloak.”” Aside from this his only weakness was the writing
of books, of which he left ten; one of them was a history of philosophy.
After Socrates died Antisthenes resumed his role as teacher. He chose as
his lecture center the gymnasium Cynosarges (Dogfish) because it was
maintained for people of low, or alien, or illegitimate birth; the name
Cynic became attached to the school rather from the place than from the
creed.” Antisthenes dressed like a workman, took no pay for his
teaching, and preferred the poor for his pupils; anyone unwilling to
practice poverty and hardship was driven away by Antisthenes’ tongue or
his club.</p>
<p>He refused at first to take Diogenes as a pupil; Diogenes insisted,
bore insult patiently, was received, and made his teacher’s doctrine
famous throughout Hellas by living it completely. Antisthenes had been
half</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 5O7</p>
<p>slaye in origin; Diogenes was a bankrupt banker from Sinope. Diogenes
had begged from actual want, and was pleased to learn that this was a pa
rt of virtue and wisdom. He adopted the beggar’s garb, wallet, and
staff, and for a time made his home in a tub or cask in the court of the
temple of Cybele at Athens.“ He envied the simple life of animals, and
tried to imitate it; he slept on the ground, ate what he could find
wherever he found it, and (we are assured) performed the duties of
nature and the rites of love in the sight of all.“ Seeing a child drink
from its hands, he threw away his cup.“ Sometimes he carried a candle or
a lantern, saying that he was looking for a man.“ He injured no one, but
refused to recognize laws, and announced himself, long before the
Stoics, a kosmopolites, or Citizen of the World. He traveled leisurely,
and we hear of him living for a time in Syracuse. On one of his journeys
he was captured by pirates, who sold him as a slave to Xeniades of
Corinth. When his owner asked him what he could do, he answered, “Govern
men.” Xeniades made him tutor of his sons and manager of his household,
in which capacities Diogenes did so well that his master called him “a
good genius,” and took his advice in many things. Diogenes continued to
live his simple life, so consistently that he became, next to Alexander,
the most famous man in Greece.</p>
<p>He was something of a poseur, and evidently relished his renown. He
had a gift for debate, and his namesake reports that he never lost an
argu- ment.“ He called freedom of speech the greatest of social goods,
and made much use of it, with coarse humor and unfailing wit. He rebuked
a woman who knelt with head to the ground before a holy image: “Are you
not afraid,” he asked her, “to be in so indecent an attitude, when some
god may be behind you, for every place is full of them?”“ When he saw
the son of a courtesan throw a stone at a crowd he warned him, “Take
care lest you hit your father.”“ He disliked women, and despised men
who^behaved like them; when a richly dressed and perfumed young
Corinthian asked him a question he said, “I will not answer you until
you tell me whethe r you are a boy or a girl.”“ All the world knows the
story of how Alexander, at</p>
<p>Corinth, came upon Diogenes lying in the sun. “I am Alexander the
Great King,” said the ruler. “I am Diogenes the dog,” said the
philosopher. “Ask of me any favor you choos e,” said the King. “Stand
out of the sun,” an - swered Diogenes. “If I were not Alexander,” said
the young warrior, “I would be Diogenes”;“ but we do not hear that the
philosopher returned the compliment. The two men died, we are asked to
believe, on the same day in 323: Alexander at Babylon in his
thirty-third year, Diogenes at Corinth in his nineties.“ The Corinthians
placed a marble dog over his</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>grave; and Sinope, which had banished him, raised a monument to his
memory.</p>
<p>Nothing could be clearer than the Cynic philosophy. It dallied
with</p>
<p>logic only long enough to dismiss as moonshine that theory of Ideas
with which Plato was bewUdering the intellectuals of Athens.
Metaphysics, too, seemed to the Cynics a vain game; we should study
nature not in order to explain the world, which is impossible, but that
we may learn the wisdom of nature as a guide to life. The only real
philosophy is ethics. The aim of life is happiness; but this is to be
found not in the pursuit of pleasure but in a simple and natural life,
independent as possible of all external aids. For though pleasure is
legitimate if it results from one’s own labor and effort, and is not
followed by remorse,“ yet it so often eludes us in the chase, or
disappoints us when captured, that it may more wisely be called an evil
than a good. A modest and virtuous life is the only road to abiding
content; wealth destroys peace, and envious desire, like a rust, eats
away the soul. Slavery is unjust but unimportant; the sage will find it
as easy to be happy in bondage as in freedom; only internal freedom
counts. The gods, said Diogenes, gave man an easy existence, but man has
complicated it by itch- ing for luxuries. Not that the Cynics put much
faith in the gods. ^en a priest explained to Antisthenes how many good
things the virtuous will enjoy after death, he asked, “Why, then, do you
not die?”“ Diogenes smiled at the Mysteries, and remarked of the
offerings set up in Samothrace by those who had surviv ed shipwreck,
“The offerings would have been much more numerous if those who were lost
had offered them instead of those who were saved.”” Everything in
religion but the practice of virtue seemed to the Cynics superstition.
Virtue must be accepted as its own re- ward and should not depend upon
the existence or justice of the gods. Virtue consists in eating,
possessing, and desiring as little as possible, drink- ing only water,
and injuring no one. Asked how to defend oneself against an adversary,
Dio genes answered, “By proving honorable and upright.”” Only sexual
desire seemed reasonable to the Cynics. They avoided mar- riage as an
external bond, but patronized prostitutes. Diogenes advocated free love
and a community of wives,” and Antisthenes, se eking independ- ence in
everything, complained that he could not satisfy his hunger as
solitarily as he could assuage his lust.” Having accepted sexual desire
as normal and natural, like hunger, the Cynics professed themselves
unable to understand why men should be ashamed to satisfy the one
appetite, like the other, in public.“ Even in death a man should be
independent, choos-</p>

<p>ing for it his own place and time; suicide is legitimate. Diogenes,
some say, killed himself by holding his breath.®</p>
<p>The Cynic philosophy was part of a “back -to- nature” movement which
arose in fifth-century Athens as a reaction of maladjustment to an
irksomely complex civilization. Men are not civilized by nature, and
bear the re- straints of ordered life only because they fear punishment
or solitude. Diogenes stood to Socrates in somewhat the same relation as
Rousseau to Voltaire: he thought that civilization was a mistake, and
that Prometheus had deserved his crucifixion for bringing it to
mankind.“ The Cynics, like the Stoics and Rousseau, idealized “nature
peoples”;“ Diogenes tried to eat meat raw because cooking was
unnatural.“ The best society, he thought, would be one without artifices
or laws.</p>
<p>The Greeks smiled upon the Cynics, and tolerated them as medieval so-
ciety tolerated its saints. After Diogenes the Cynics became a religious
order without religion; they made a rule of poverty, lived on alms, tem-
pered their celibacy with promiscuity, and opened schools of philosophy.
They had no homes, but taught and slept in the street or the temple por-
ticoes. Through Diogenes’ disciples, Stilpo and Crates, the Cynic
doctrine passed down into the Hellenistic age, and formed the basis of
Stoicism. The school disappeared as an entity about the end of the third
century; but its influence remained strong in the Greek tradition, and
perhaps reap- peared in the Essenes of Judea and the monks of early
Christian Egypt. How far all these movements were influenced by, or
influenced, similar sects in India, scholarship cannot yet say. The
“back -to- nature” devotees of our own day are the intellectual
descendants of those men and women of Oriental or Greek antiquity who,
tired of unnatural and cramping re- straints, thought that they could
turn and live with the animals. No full life is without a touch of this
urban fantasy.</p>

imagination in Greek history. Plato’s plan for a communistic aristocracy
was the brilliant endeavor of a rich conservative to reconcile his scorn
of democracy with the radical idealism of his time.</p>
<p>He came of a family so ancient that on his mother’s side his pedigree
went</p>
<p>Then, when Plato was twenty-three, came the tory revolution of 404,
led by his own relatives; the tense days of the oligarchic terror, and
the brave defiance of the Thirty by Socrates; the death of Critias and
Char- mides, the restoration of the democracy, the trial and death of
Socrates: all the world seemed to collapse about the once carefree
youth, and he fled from Athens as if it were a haunted city. He found
some comfort at Megara in the home of Eucleides, and then at Cyrene,
perhaps with Aris- tippus; thence he appears to have gone to Egypt and
studied the mathemati- cal and historical lore of the priests.” About
395 he was back in Athens, and a year later fought for the city at
Corinth. About 387 he set forth again, studied the Pythagorean
philosophy with Archytas at Taras and with Timaeus at Locri, passed over
to Sicily to see Mt. Etna, formed a friend- ship with Dion of Syracuse,
was introduced to Dionysius I, was sold into slavery, and was back safe
in Athens in 386. With the three thousand drachmas raised to reimburse
his ransomer, and which Anniceris refused, Plato’s friends now bought
for him a suburban recreation grove named</p>

<p>from its local god Academus and there Plato founded the university
that was destined to be the intellectual center of Greece for nine
hundred years.*</p>
<p>The Academy was technically a religious fraternity, or thiasos,
dedi-</p>
<p>cated to the worship of the Muses. The students paid no fees, but as
they came for the most part from upper-class families their parents
could be expected to make substantial donations to the institution; rich
men, says Suidas, “from time to time bequeathed in their wills, to the
members of the school, the means of living a life of philosophic
leisure.”” Dionysius II was reported to have given Pla to eighty talents
(80,000)“— which might ex- plain the philosopher’s patience with the
King. The comic poets of the time satirized the students as affected in
their manners and overnice in their dress — with elegant caps and canes,
and a short cloak or academic gown;“ so old are the manners of Eton, and
the black robes of scholarship. Women were admitted to the student body,
for Plato remained to this extent a radi- cal, that he was an ardent
feminist. The chief studies were mathematics and philosophy. Over the
portal was a warning inscription — merfw ageometre- tos cmw — “Let no
one without geometry enter here”; perhaps a consider - able measure of
mathematics formed a requirement for admission. Most of the mathematical
advances of the fourth century were made by men who had studied in the
Academy. The mathematical course included arith- metic (theory of
number), advanced geometry, “spheric” (astronomy), “music” (probably
including literature and history), law, and philosophy.“ Moral and
political philosophy came last, if Plato followed the advice which —
half justifying Anytus and Meletus — he puts into the mouth of
Socrates:</p>
<p>Socr. You know that there are certain principles about justice</p>
<p>and good which were taught us in childhood; and under their pa-</p>

their fathers and obey them.</p>

<p>then arguments come and refute the word of the legislator, and</p>
<p>he is driven into believing that nothing is fair any more than
foul,</p>

them?</p>

<p>thirty-year-old citizens to dialectic. . . . They must not be
allowed</p>
<p>to taste the dear delight too early; that is one thing specially to
be</p>
<p>avoided; for young men, as you may have observed, when they first get
the taste in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always

<p>them; they are like puppy-dogs, who delight to tear and pull at

<p>who come near them.</p>

into</p>
<p>a way of not believing anything that they believed before, and</p>

<p>GL That is very true.</p>

<p>guilty of that sort of insanity; he will follow the example of
the</p>

<p>Plato and his aides taught by lecturing, by dialogue, and by setting
prob- lems to the students. One problem was to find “the uniform and
ordered movements by the assumption of which the apparent motions of the
planets can be accounted for”;“^ pos sibly Eudoxus and Heracleides
derived some stimulus from these tasks. The lectures were technical, and
sometimes dis- appointed those who had hoped for practical gain; but
pupils like Aristotle, Demosthenes, Lycurgus, Hypereides, and Xenocrates
were deeply influ- enced by them, and in many cases published the notes
they had taken.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 513</p>
<p>Antiphanes said humorously that just as, in a far northern city,
words froze into ice as they were spoken, and were heard in the summer
when they thawed, so the words spoken by Plato to his students in their
youth were finally understood by them only in their old age.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Artist</li>
</ol>
<p>Plato himself professed never to have v/ritten any technical
treatises,™ and Aristotle refers to the teaching in the Academy as
Plato’s “unwritten doctrine.”” How far this differed from the teaching
of the Dialogues we do not know.* Probably these were undertaken
originally as a recreation, and in a half - humorous vein.” It is one of
the playful ironies of history that the philosophical works most
reverenced and studied in European and American universities today were
composed in an attempt to make philoso- phy intelligible to the layman
by binding it up with a human personality. It was not the first time
that philosophical dialogues had been written; Zeno of Elea and several
others had used this method,” and Simon of Ath - ens, a leather cutter,
had published, in dialogue, a report of the Socratic conversations held
in his shop.” It was in Plato a literary, not an historical, form; he
did not pretend to give accurate accounts of conversations held thirty
or fifty years before, nor even to keep his references consistent.
Gorgias, as well as Socrates, was astounded to hear the words that the
young dramatist- philosopher had put into his mouth.” The Dialogues were
writ - ten independently of one another, and perhaps at long intervals;
we must not be shocked by slips of memory, much less by changes of view.
There is no design unifying the whole, except as the continuing search
of a visibly developing mind for a truth which it never finds.f</p>
<p>The Dialogues are cleverly and yet poorly constructed. They
vivify</p>
<p>the drama of ideas, and build up a coherent and affectionate portrait
of Socrates; but they seldom achieve unity or continuity, they often
wander from subject to subject, and they are frequently cast into a
clumsily indirect mood by being presented as narrative reports, by one
man, of other men’s</p>
<p>• Certain passages in Aristotle sugge st a different understanding of
Plato — especially of the theory of Ideas — than that which we get from
the Dialogues.</p>
<p>tThe thirty-six Dialogues cannot be dated or authoritatively
classified. We may arbi- trarily divide them into (i) an early group —
chiefly the Apology, Crito, Lysis, Ion, Charmides, Cratylus, Euthyphro,
and Euthydemus; (2) a middle group — chiefly Gorgias, Protagoras,
Phaedo, Symposium, Phaedrus, and Republic; and (3) a later group —
chiefly Parmenides, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Philebus, Timaeus,
and Laws, The first group was probably composed before the age of
thirty-four, the second before forty, the third after sixty, the
interval being devoted to the Academy.”</p>
<p>514</p>

<p>conversations. Socr ates tells us that he has “a wretched memory,”“
and then recites to a friend, verbatim, fifty-four pages of a discussion
which he had carried on in his youth with Protagoras. Most of the
Dialogues are weakened by the absence of vigorous interlocutors capable
of saying to Socrates something other than “yes” or its equivalent. But
these faults are lost in the clear brilliance of the language, the humor
of situation, expres- sion, and idea, the living world of varied
characters humanly realized, and the frequent opening of windows into a
profound and noble mind. We may judge the value that the anci.ents
unconsciously put upon these Dia- logues when we consider that they are
the most complete product that has come down to us from any Greek
author. Their form entitles them to as high a place in the annals of
literature as their content has given them in the history of
thought.</p>
<p>The earlier Dialogues are excellent examples of the youthful
“eristic” condemned in the passage quoted a while back, but they are
redeemed by the charming pictures they give of Athenian youth. The
Symposium is the masterpiece of its genre, and the best introduction to
Plato; its dramatic 7mse en sckne (“Imagine,” says Agathon to his
servants, “that you are our hosts, and th at I and the company are your
guests”“), its living picture of Aristophanes, “hiccoughing because he
had eaten too much,” its lively epi - sode of the drunken and scandalous
Alcibiades, above all, its subtle com- bination of merciless realism in
the portrayal of Socrates with the loftiest idealism in his conception
of love — these qualities make the Symposium one of the peaks in the
history of prose. The Phaedo is more subdued, and more beautiful; here
the main argument, however weak, is honest, and gives its opponents a
fair chance; the style flows more smoothly over a scene whose noble calm
overcomes its tragedy, making the death of Socrates come as quietly as
the turn of a river out of sight around a bend. Part of the dia- logue
of the Phaedrus takes place on the banks of the Ilissus, while Socrates
and his pupil are cooling their feet in the stream. Greatest of all
dialogues, of course, is the Republic, being the fullest exposition of
Plato’s philosophy, and in its earlier parts a dramatic conflict of
personalities and ideas. The Parmenides is the worst specimen of empty
logic-chopping in all literature, and the bravest example in the history
of philosophy of a thinker irrefutably refuting his own mosjt beloved
doctrine — the theory of Ideas. Then, in the later Dialogues, the
artistry of Plato wanes, Socrates fades from the pic- ture, metaphysics
loses its poetry, politics its youthful ideals; until, in the Laws, the
weary inheritor of all the culture of many-sided Athens surren-</p>

<p>ders to the lure of Sparta, and gives up freedom, and poetry, and
art, and philosophy itself.</p>

<li>The Metaphysician</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no system in Plato, and if here, for order’s sake, his ideas
are summarized under the classic heads of logic, metaphysics, ethics,
esthetics, and politics, it should be remembered that Plato himself was
too intense a poet to shackle his thought in a frame. Because he is a
poet he has most difficulty with logic; he wanders about seeking
definitions, and loses his way in perilous analogies; “then we got into
a labyrinth, and, when we - ular dialogues, technical terms — essence,
poiver, action, passion, generation —which will be useful to later
philosophy; he names five of the ten “cate - gories” that will make up
part of Aristotle’s fame. He reje cts the Sophist view that the senses
are the best test of truth, that the individual “man is the measure of
all things”; if that were so, he argues, any man’s, any sleeper’s, any
madman’s, any baboon’s report of the world would be as good as any
other. ”</p>
<p>All that the “rabble of the senses” gives us is a Heracleitean flux
of</p>
<p>change; if we had only sensations, we should never have any knowledge
or truth at all. Knowledge is possible through Ideas, through
generalized images and forms that mold the chaos of sensation into the
order of thought.” If we could be conscious only of individual things
thought would be impossible. We learn to think by grouping things into
classes according to their likenesses, and expressing the class as a
whole by a common noun; man enables us to think of all men, table of all
tables, light of every light that ever shone on land or sea. These Ideas
{ideai, eida) are not objective to the senses but they are real to
thought, for they remain, and are un- changed, even when all the sense
objects to which they correspond are destroyed. Men are born and die,
but man survives. Every individual triangle is only imperfectly a
triangle, sooner or later passes away, and therefore is relatively
unreal; but triangle — the form and law of all triangles</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>516</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>— is perfect and everlasting.® All mathematical forms are Ideas,
eternal and complete;* everything that geometry says of triangles,
circles, squares, cubes, spheres would remain true, and therefore
“real,” even if there had never been, and never would be, any such
figures in the physical world. Abstractions also are real in this sense;
individual acts of virtue have a brief existence, but virtue remains as
a permanent reality for thought, and an instrument of thought; so with
beauty, largeness, likeness, and so forth; these are as real to the mind
as beautiful, large, or like things are real to the sense.” Individual
acts or things are what they are by partaking of, and more or less
realizing, these perfect forms or Ideas. The world of science and
philosophy is composed not of individual things, but of Ideas;t“ his -
tory, as distinct from biography, is the story of man; biology is the
science not of specific organisms, but of life; mathematics is the study
not of con- crete things but of number, relation, and form independently
of things and yet as valid for all things. Philosophy is the science of
Ideas.</p>
<p>Everything in Plato’s metaphysics turns upon the theory of Ideas.
God, th e Prime Mover Unmoved, or Soul of the World,” moves and orders
all things according to the eternal laws and forms, the perfect and
changeless Ideas which constitute, as the Neo-Platonists would say, the
Logos, or Divine Wisdom or Mind of God. The highest of the Ideas is the
Good. Sometimes Plato identifies this with God himself;” more often it
is the guid - ing instrument of creation, the supreme form towards which
all things are drawn. To perceive this Good, to vision the molding ideal
of the creative process, is the loftiest goal of knowledge.” Motion and
creation are not mechanical; they require in the world, as in ourselves,
a soul or principle of life as their originative power.“</p>
<p>Only that which has power is real;” therefore matter is not basi
cally real</p>
<p>• In his later years Plato tried to prove the Pythagorean converse,
that all Ideas are mathe - matical forms.®®</p>
<p>t Cf. Carrel: “For modem scientists, as for Plato, Ideas are the sole
reality.”®® Cf. Spinoza: “I do not understand, by the seri es of causes
and real entities, a series of individual mutable things, but rather the
series of fixed and eternal things. For it would be impossible for human
weakness to follow up the series of individual mutable things, not only
because their number surpasses all counting, but because . . . the
existence of particular things has no connection with their essence, and
is not an eternal tmth.” (In order that the geometry of triangles may be
true, it is not necessary that any particular triangle should e xist.)
“However, there is no need that we should understand the series of
individual mutable things, for their essence … is only to be found in
fixed and eternal things, and from the laws inscribed in those things as
their true codes, according to whi ch all individual things are made and
arranged.”®® Note that in Plato’s theory of Ideas Heracleitus and
Parmenides are reconciled: Heracleitus is right, and flux is true, in
the world of sense; Parmenides is right, and changeless unity is true,
in the world of Ideas.</p>

<li>The Moralist</li>
</ol>
<p>Plato knows that many of his readers will be skeptics, and for a
while he struggles to find a natural ethic that shall stir men’s souls
to righteous - ne ss without relying on heaven, purgatory, and hell.’”
The Dialogues of his middle period turn more and more from metaphysics
to morals and poli- tics: “The greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by
far is that which is con - cerned with the ordering of state s and
families.”‘” The problem of ethics lies in the apparent conflict between
individual pleasure and social good. Plato presents the problem fairly,
and puts into the mouth of Callias as strong an argument for selfishness
as any immoralist has ever gi ven.’” He recognizes that many pleasures
are good; intelligence is needed to discrim- inate between good and
harmful pleasures; and for fear that intelligence may come too late we
must inculcate in the young a habit of temperance, a sense of the golden
mean.’”</p>
<p>The soul or principle of life has three levels or parts — desire,
will, and thought; each part has its own virtue — moderation, courage,
and wisdom; to which should be added piety and justice- the fulfillment
of one’s obli - gations to his parents and his gods. Justice may be
defined as the co-opera- tion of the parts in a whole, of the elements
in a character, or of the people in a state, each part performing its
fittest function properly.’” The Good</p>
<p>• How much of this Hindu -Pythagorean-Oq^hic doctrine of immortality
was protective coloration it is hard to say. Plato presents it half
playfully, as if it were merely a useful myth, a poetic aid to
decency.“*®</p>
<p>5*8 THE LIFE OF GREECE (cHAP. XXI</p>
<p>is neither reason alone nor pleasure alone, but that mingling of
them, in pro- portion and measure, which produces the Life of Reason.””
The supreme good lies in pure knowledge of the eternal forms and laws.
Morally “the highest good … is the power or faculty, if there be such,
which the soul has of loving the truth, and of doing all things for the
sake of truth.’”“ He who so loves truth will not care to return evil for
evil;”” he will think it bet - ter to suffer injustice than to do it; he
will “go forth by sea and land to seek after men who are incorruptible,
whose acquaintance is beyond price. . . . The true votaries of
philosophy abstain from all fleshly lusts; and when philosophy offers
them a purification and release from evil, they feel that they ought not
to resist her influence; to her they incline, and whither she leads they
follow her.”””</p>
<p>Plato had burned his poems, and lost his religious faith. But he
remained a poet and a worshiper; his conception of the Good was suffused
with esthetic emotion and ascetic piety; philosophy and religion became
one in him, ethic and esthetic were fused. As he grew older he became
incapable of seeing any beauty apart from goodness and truth. He would
censor, in his ideal state, all art and poetry that might seem to the
government to have an immoral or unpatriotic tendency; all rhetoric and
all nonreligious drama would be barred; even Homer — seductive painter
of an immoral theology — would have to go. The Dorian and Phrygian modes
of music might be allowed; but there must be no complicated instruments,
no vir- tuosos making “a beastly noise” with their technical displays,
““ and no radi - cal novelties.</p>
<p>The introduction of a new kind of music must be shunned as im-</p>
<p>periling the whole state, for styles of music are never disturbed</p>
<p>without affecting the most important political institutions. . . .
The</p>
<p>new style, gradually gaining a lodgment, quietly insinuates
itself</p>
<p>into manners and customs, and from these it . . . goes on to
attack</p>
<p>laws and constitutions, displaying the utmost impudence, until it</p>
<p>ends by overturning everything.”^</p>
<p>Beauty, like virtue, lies in fitness, symmetry, and order. A work of
art should be a living creature, with head, trunk, and limbs all
vitalized and unified by one idea.“ True beauty, thinks our passionat e
puritan, is intel- lectual rather than physical; the figures of geometry
are “eternally and ab - solutely beautiful,” and the laws whereby the
heavens are made are fairer than the stars.”* Love is the pursuit of
beauty, and has three stages, accord - ing as it is love of the body, or
of the soul, or of truth. Love of the body, between man and woman, is
legitimate as a means to generation, which is</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 519</p>
<p>a kind of immortality;“* nevertheless this is a rudimentary form of
love, unworthy of a philosopher. Physical love between man and man, or
woman and woman, is unnatural, and must be suppressed as frustrating
reproduc- tion.“* This can be done by sublimating it in the second or
spiritual stage of love: here the older man loves the younger because
his comeliness is a symbol and reminder of pure and eternal beauty, and
the younger loves the older because his wisdom opens a way to
understanding and honor. But the highest love is “the love of the
everlasting possession of the Good,” that love which seeks the absolute
beauty of the perfect and eternal Ideas or forms.“* This, and not
fleshless affection between man and woman, is “Platonic love”— the point
at which the poet and the philosopher in Plato merge in the passionate
desire for understanding, an almost mystic longing for the Beatific
Vision of the law and structure and life and goal of the world.</p>
<p>For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has</p>

state.”“’ “And then democracy comes into being, after the poor have
conquered their opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while
to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power.”““ The
democrats turn out to b e as bad as the pluto- crats: they use the power
of their number to vote doles to the people and offices to themselves;
they flatter and pamper the multitudes until liberty</p>

<p>Socr. The excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction</p>

states or individuals, seems only to pass into slavery . . . and the
most aggra- vated form of tyranny arises out of the most extreme form
of</p>
<p>liberty.”</p>
<p>When liberty becomes license, dictatorship is near. The rich, afraid
that democracy will bleed them, conspire to overthrow it;“° or some
enterpri s- ing individual seizes power, promises everything to the
poor, surrounds himself with a personal army, kills first his enemies
and then his friends “until he has made a purgation of the state,” and
establishes a dictatorship.”* In such a conflict of extremes the
philosopher who preaches moderation and mutual understanding is like “a
man fallen among wild beasts”; if he is wise he will “retire under the
shelter of a wall while the hurrying wind and the storm go by.”“*</p>
<p>Some students, in such crises, take refuge in the past, and write
history; Plato takes refuge in the future, and models a utopia. First,
he fancies, we must find a good king who will let us experiment with his
people. Then we must send away all the adults except those necessary to
maintain order and teach the young, for the ways of their elders would
corrupt the young into an image of the past. To all the young, of
whatever sex or class, twenty years of education will be given. It will
include the teaching of myths —</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 52I</p>
<p>not the immoral myths of the old faith, but new myths that may tame
the soul into obedience to parents and the state.* At twenty all are to
be given physical, mental, and moral tests. Those that fail will become
the economic classes of our state — businessmen, workingmen, farmers;
they will have private property, and different degrees of wealth (within
limits) according to their ability; but there will be no slaves. The
survivors of the first test will receive ten further years of education
and training. At thirty they will be tested again. Those that fail will
become soldiers; they shall have no private property, and shall not
engage in business, but shall live in a military communism. Those that
pass the second test will now (and none before) take up for five years
the study of “divine philosophy’”” in all its branches, from mathematics
and logic to politics and law. At thirty-five the survivors, with all
their theory on their heads, will be flung into the practical world to
earn their living and make themselves a place. At fifty such of them as
are still alive shall become, without election, members of the guardian
or ruling class.</p>
<p>They shall have all powers, but no possessions. There will be no
laws; all cases and issues will be decided by the philosopher-kings
according to a wisdom untrammeled by precedent. Lest they abuse these
powers, they shall have no property, no money, no families, no permanent
individual wives; the people will hold the power of the purse, the
soldiers the power of the sword. Communism is not democratic, it is
aristocratic; the common soul is incapable of it; only soldiers and
philosophers can bear it. As for marriage, it must in all classes be
strictly regulated by the guardians as a eugenic sacrament: “The best of
either sex should be united with the best as often as possible, and the
inferior with the inferior; and they are to rear the offspring of one
sort of union, but not of the other; for this is the only way of keeping
the flock in prime condition.’”” All children are to be</p>
<p>brought up by the state, and given equal educational opportunity;
classes are not to be hereditary. Girls shall have an equal chance with
boys, and no office in the state shall be closed to women because they
are women. By this combination of individualism, communism, eugenics,
feminism, and aristocracy Plato thinks that a society might be produced
in which a philosopher would be glad to live. And he concludes: “Until
philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the
spirit and power of philosophy . . . cities will never cease from ill,
nor the human race.’””</p>
<p>Le., Plato concludes that a natural ethic is inadequate.</p>

<p>6 . The Lawmaker</p>
<p>He thought that he had found such a prince in Dionysius II. He
felt,</p>
<p>like Voltaire, that monarchy has this advantage over democracy, that
in a monarchy the reformer has only to convince one man.“* To make a
better</p>
<p>In his declining years, still longing to be a legislator, Plato
offered a third- best state. The Laws, besides being the earliest extant
classic of European jurisprudence, is an instructive study in the senile
aftermath of youthful romanticism. The new city, says Plato, must be
placed inland, lest foreign ideas undermine its faith, foreign trade its
peace, and foreign luxuries its self-contained simplicity.“* The number
of free citizens shall be limited to the conveniently divisible number
of 5040; in addition to these will be their families and their slaves.
The citizens shall elect 360 guardians, divided into groups of thirty,
each group administering the state for a month. The 360 shall choose a
Nocturnal Council of twenty-six, which shall meet at night and legislate
on all vital affairs.”* These councilors shall allot the land in equal,
indivisible, and inalienable parcels among the citizen families. The
guardians “shall provide against the rains doing h arm instead of good
to the land . . . and shall keep them back by works and ditches, and
make” irrigation “streams furnish even to the dry places plenty of
water.””* To control the growth of economic inequality, trade is to be
held to a mini- mum; no gold or silver is to be kept by the people, and
there shall be no lending of money at interest;”* everyone is to be
discouraged from living by investment, and is to be encouraged to live
as an active farmer on the land. Any man who acquires more than four
times the value of one share of land must surrender the surplus to the
state; and severe limits are to be placed upon the power of
bequest.<em>” Women are to have equal educational and political
opportunity with men.</em>” Men must marry between thirty and thirty-
five, or pay heavy annual fines;”* and they are to beget children for
only ten years. Drinking and other public amusements are to be regu-
lated to preserve the morals of the people.*“</p>
<p>To accomplish all this peaceably there must be complete state control
of education, publication, and other means of forming public opinion and
personal character. The highest official in the state is to be the
minister of</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 523</p>
<p>education. Authority will replace liberty in education, for the
intelligence of children is too undeveloped to excuse us for leaving to
them the guid- ance of their own lives. Literature, science, and the
arts are to be under censorship; they will be forbidden to express ideas
which the councilors consider hurtful to public morals and piety. Since
obedience to parents and the laws can be secured only through
supernatural sanctions and aids, the state shall determine what gods are
to be worshiped, and how, and when. Any citizen who questions this state
religion is to be imprisoned; if he per- sists he is to be killed.^®</p>
<p>A long life is not always a blessing; it would have been better for
Plato to have died before writing this indictment of Socrates, these
prolegomena to all future Inquisitions. His defense would be that he
loved justice more than truth; that his aim was to abolish poverty and
war; that he could do this only by strict state control of the
individual; and that this required either force or religion. The
degenerative Ionian looseness of Athenian morals and politics, he
thought, would be cured only by the Dorian disci- pline of the Spartan
code. Through all of Plato’s thought runs the fear of the abuses of
freedom, and the conception of philosophy as the policeman of the people
and the regulator of the arts. The Lavis offers the surrender of a dying
Athens that had completely lived to a Sparta that, ever since Lycurgus,
had been dead. When Athens’ most famous philosopher could find so little
to say for freedom Greece was ripe for a king.</p>
<p>Looking back over this body of speculation we are surprised to see
how fully Plato anticipated the philosophy, the theology, and the
organization of medieval Christianity, and how much of the modern
Fascist state. The theory of Ideas bec ame the “realism” of the
Scholastics— the objective real- ity of “universals.” Plato is not only
a pra -existent Christlich, as Nietzsche called him, but a pre-Christian
Puritan. He distrusts human nature as evil, and thinks of it as an
original sin tainting the soul. He breaks up into an evil body and a
divine spirit”* that unity of body and soul which had been the educated
Greek ideal of the sixth and fifth centuries; like a Christian ascetic
he calls the body the tomb of the soul. He takes from Pythagoras and
Orphism an Oriental faith in transmigration, karma, sin, purification,
and “release”; he adopts, in his last works, the other -worldly tone of
a con- verted and repentant Augustine. One would almost say that Plato
was not Greek if it were not for his perfect prose.</p>
<p>He remains the most likable of the Greek thinkers because he had the
attractive faults of his people. He was so sensitive that like Dante he
could see perfect and eternal beauty behind the imperfect and temporal
form;</p>
<p>5M</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GBEECE</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>he was an ascetic because at every moment he had to rein in a rich
and impetuous temperament.*“ He was a poet possessed by imagination,
allured by every whimsy of thought, enthralled by the tragedy and comedy
of ideas, flushed with the intellectual excitement of the free mental
life of Athens. But it was his fate that he was a logician as well as a
poet; that he was the most brilliant reasoner of antiquity, subtler than
Zeno of Elea or Aristotle; that he loved philosophy more than he loved
any woman or any man; and that in the end, like Dostoevski’s Grand
Inquisitor, he concluded to a suppression of all free reasoning, a
conviction that philosophy must be destroyed in order that man may live.
He himself would have been the first victim of his Utopias.</p>

<li>Wander-Years</li>
</ol>
<p>When Plato died Aristotle built an altar to him, and gave him almost
divine honors; for he had loved Plato even if he could not like him. He
had come to Athens from his native Stageirus, a small Greek settlement
in Thrace. His father had been court physician to Philip’s father,
Amyntas II, and (if Galen was not mistaken) had taught the boy some
anatomy be- fore sending him to Plato.’“ The two rival strains in the
history of thou ght — the mystical and the medical — met and warred in
the conjunction of the two philosophers. Perhaps Aristotle would have
developed a thoroughly scientific mind had he not listened so long to
Plato (some say for twenty years); the doctor’s son struggled in him
with the Puritan’s pupil, and neither side won; Aristotle never quite
made up his mind. He gathered about him scientific observations
sufficient for an encyclopedia, and then tried to force them into the
Platonic mold in which his scholastic mind had been formed. He refuted
Plato at every turn because he borrowed from him on every page.</p>
<p>He was an earnest student, and soon caught the eye of his master.
When Plato read at the Academy his treatise on the soul, Aristotle, says
Diogenes Laerti us, “was the only person who sat it out, while all the
rest rose up and went away.’”“ After Plato’s death (347) Aristotle went
to the court of Hermeias, who had studied with him at the Academy and
had raised himself from slavery to be the dictator of Atameus and Assus
in upper Asia Minor. Aristotle married Hermeias’ daughter Pythias (344),
and was</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY to settle in Assus when Hermeias
was assassinated by the Persians, who suspected him of planning to help
Philip’s proposed invasion of Asia.<em>“ Aristotle fled with Pythias to
near-by Lesbos, and spent some time there in studying the natural
history of the island.</em>“ Pythias died after giv- ing him a daughter.
Later Aristotle married, or lived with, the hetaira Herpyllis;<em>“ but
he maintained to the end a tender devotion to the memory of Pythias, and
at his death asked that his bones be laid beside hers; he was not quite
the emotionless bookworm that one might picture from his works. In 343
Philip, who prob ably had known him as a youth at Amyntas’ court,
invited him to undertake the education of Alexander, then a wild lad of
thirteen. Aristotle came to Pella and labored at the task for four
years. In 340 Philip commissioned him to direct the restoration and
repeopling of Stageirus, which had been laid waste in the war with
Olynthus, and to draw up a code of laws for it; all of which he
accomplished to the satisfac- tion of the city, which commemorated its
re-establishment by him in an annual holiday.</em>“</p>
<p>In 334 he returned to Athens, and — probably aided by funds from
Alex- ander-opened a school of rhetoric and philosophy. He chose as its
home the most elegant of Athens’ gymnasiums, a group of buildings
dedicated to Apollo Lyceus (God of Shepherds), surrounded with shady
gardens and covered walks. In the morning he taught advanced subjects to
regular stu- dents; in the afternoon he lectured to a more popular
audience, probably on rhetoric, poetry, ethics, and politics. He
collected here a large library, a zoological garden, and a museum of
natural history. The school came to be called the Lyceum, and the group
and its philosophy were named Peri- patetic from the covered walks
(peripatoi) along which Aristotle liked to move with his students as he
discoursed.*“ A sharp rivalry developed be- tween the Lyceum, whose
students were mostly of the middle class, the Academy, which drew its
membership largely from the aristocracy, and the school of Isocrates,
which was frequented chiefly by colonial Greeks. The rivalry was eased
in time by the emphasis of Isocrates on rhetoric, of the Academy on
mathematics, metaphysics, and politics, and of the Lyceum on natural
science. Aristotle set his pupils to gathering and co-ordinating
knowledge in every field: the customs of barbarians, the constitutions
of the Greek cities, the chronology of victors in the Pythian games and
the Athe- nian Dionysia, the organs and habits of animals, the character
and distri- bution of plants, and the history of science and philosophy.
These re- searches became a treasury of data upon which he drew,
sometimes too confidently, for his varied and innumerable treatises.</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>5^6</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>For the layman he wrote some twenty-seven popular dialogues, which
Cicero and (Quintilian considered equal to Plato’s; it was chiefly by
these that he was known in antiquity.’** These dialogues were among the
casual - ties of the barbarian conquest of Rome. What remains to us is a
mass of technical, highly abstract, and inimitably dull works rarely
referred to by ancient scholars, and apparently composed, in the last
twelve years of his life, of notes made for his lectures by himself, or
from his lectures by his pupils. These technical compendiums were not
known outside the Lyceum until they were published by Andronicus of
Rhodes in the first century B.c.““ Forty of them survive, but Diogenes
Laertius mentions 360 more— probably brief monographs. In these ashes of
scholarship we must seek the once living thought that in later ages won
for Aristotle the title of The Philosopher. We must approach him
expecting no brilliance like Plato’s and no wit like Diogenes’, but only
a rich argosy of knowledge, and such conservative wisdom as befits the
friend and pensioner of kings.*</p>
<p>2 . The Scientist</p>
<p>Aristotle has traditionally been considered as primarily a
philosopher. Perhaps this is a mistake. Let us, if only for a fresh
view, consider him chiefly as a scientist.</p>
<p>His curious mind is interested, to begin with, in the process and
tech- nique of reasoning; and so acutely does he analyze these that his
“Organon,” or Instrument — the name given after his death to his logical
treatises — be- came the textbook of logic for two thousand years. He
longs to think clearly, though he seldom, in his extant works, succeeds;
he spends half his time defining his terms, and then feels that he has
solved the problem. Definition itself he defines definitively as the
specification of an object or idea by naming the genus or class to which
it belongs (“man is an animaV’)</p>

<p>and the specific difference that distinguishes it from all other
members of that class (“man is a rational animal”) - It is
characteristic of his methodical way that he arranged in ten
“categories” the basic aspects under which anything may be considered:
substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position,
possession, activity, passivity — a classification that some writers
have found an aid in the amplification of their flagging thought.</p>
<p>He accepts the senses as the only source of knowledge. Universals are
generalized ideas, not innate but formed from many perceptions of like
objects; they are conceptions, not things.“° He lays down resolutely, as
the axiom of all logic, the principle of contradiction: “It is
impossible for the same attribute at once to belong and not to belong to
the same thing in the same relation.””* He exposes the fallacies into
which sophists fall or lure us. He criticizes his predecessors for
having drawn the universe, or their theories of it, out of their heads,
instead of devoting themselves to patient observation a nd
experiment.<em>” His ideal of deductive reasoning is the syllogism — a
trio of propositions of which the third follows necessarily from the
others; but he recognizes that a syllogism, to avoid begging the
question, must presuppose a wide induction to make its major premise
prob- able. Though in his philosophical treatises he too often loses
himself in deductive reasoning, he lauds induction, accumulates in his
scientific works a mass of specific observations, and occasionally
records his own or others’ experiments.</em> With all his errors he is
the father of scientific method, and the first man known to have
organized co-operative scientific research.</p>
<p>He takes up science where Democritus left it, and dares to enter
every field. He is weakest in mathematics and physics, and confines
himself there to a study of first principles. He seeks in the Physics
not new discoveries but clear definitions of the terms used — matter,
motion, space, time, con- tinuity, infinite, change, end. Motion and
space are continuous, they are not made up, as Zeno assumed, of small
indivisible moments or parts; the “infinite” exists potentially, but not
actually.<em>” He feels, though he does nothing to solve, the problems
that were to arouse Newton — inertia, gravity, motion, velocity; he has
some idea of the parallelogram of forces, and states the law of the
lever: “The moving weight will more easily move” (the object) “the
farther away it is from the fulcrum.”</em>“</p>
<p>He argues that the heavenly bodies — certainly the earth — are
spherical, for only a spherical earth could explain the shape of the
moon when it is</p>
<p>• E.g., in the Reproduction of Animals (iv. 6.1) he refers to the
regrowth of the eyes when</p>
<p>5*8 THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>eclipsed by the intervention of the ea rth between it and the sun.“°
He has an admirable sense of geological time; periodically but
imperceptibly, he tells us, the sea is replaced by land and land by the
sea;“° countless nations and civilizations have appeared and
disappeared, whether through swift catastrophe or slow time: “Probably
every art and philosophy has been repeatedly developed to the utmost and
has perished again.”“” Heat is the chief agent of geological and
meteorological changes. He hazards explana- tions of clouds, fog, dew,
frost, rain, snow, hail, wind, thunder, lightning, the rainbow, and
meteors. His theories are often bizarre; but the epochal importance of
the little treatise on meteorology is that it invokes no super- natural
agencies, but seeks to account for the apparent whims of the weather
through natural causes operating in certain sequences and regu-
larities. Natural science could go no further until invention gave it
instru- ments of greater scope and precision in observation and
measurement.</p>
<p>It is in biology that Aristotle is most at home, observes most widely
and abundantly, and makes the most mistakes. The consolidation of
previous discoveries in the final establishment of this vital science is
his supreme achievement. With the help of his pupils, he gathered data
on the fauna and flora of the Aegean countries, and brought together the
first scientific collections of animals and plants. If we may follow
Pliny,”* Alexander gave orders to his hunters, gamekeepers, fishermen,
and others to supply Aristotle with whatever species and information he
might request. The philosopher apologizes for his interest in lowly
things: “In all natural objects there lies some marvel, and if any one
despises the contemplation of the lower ani- mals, he must despise
himself.’””</p>
<p>He classifies the animal kingdom into enmma and amima — hlooAtd and
bloodless — approximately corresponding to our “vertebrates” and
“inverte - brates.” He subdivides the bloodless animals into testaceans,
crustaceans, mollusks, and insects; the sanguineous into fishes,
amphibians, birds, and mammals. He covers an impressively vast and
varied field: organs of diges- tion, excretion, sensation, locomotion,
reproduction, and defense; the types and ways of fishes, birds,
reptiles, apes, and hundreds of other groups; their pairing seasons and
their methods of bearing and rearing their young; the phenomena of
puberty, menstruation, conception, pregnancy, abortion, heredity, twins;
the habitats and migrations of animals, their parasites and diseases,
their modes of sleep and hibernation. . . . He gives an excellent
account of the life of the bee.”“ He is full of queer incidental
observations: that the blood of oxen coagulates more rapidly than that
of most other ani-</p>
<p>CHAP.XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 529</p>
<p>mals; that some male animals, especially the goat, have been known to
give milk; that “in both sexes the horse is the most salacious of
animals after</p>
<p>»#iai</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>He is particularly interested in the reproductive structures and
habits of animals, and marvels at the multiplicity of ways in which
nature achieves the continuance of species, “preserving the type when
she is unable to pre - serve the individual” in this field his work
remained unequaled until the last century. The life of animals moves
about two foci — eating and pro- creation.’“ “The female has an organ
which must be regarded as an ovary, for it contains that which at first
is undifferentiated egg, and which be- comes by differentiation many
eggs.”!’** The female el ement contributes to the embryo material and
food, the male element contributes energy and movement; the female is
the passive element, the male is the activating agent.”* Aristotle
rejects the opinions of Empedocles and Democritus, that the sex of the
embryo is determined by the temperature of the womb, or by the
preponderance of one reproductive element over the other, and then
reformulates the theories as his own: “Whenever the formative (male)
principle fails to gain the upper hand, and from deficient warmth fails
prop- erly to cook the material and so fashion it into its own shape,
then will this material pass over into … the female.”’“ “Sometimes,” he
adds, “women bring forth three or even four children, especially in
certain parts of the world. The largest number ever brought forth is
five, and such an occur- rence has been witnessed on several occasions.
There was once upon a time a woman who had twenty children at four
births; and most of them grew up.’”“</p>
<p>He anticipates many theories of nineteenth-century biology. He be-
lieves that the organs and characteristics of the embryo are formed by
tiny particles (the “gemmules” of Darwin’s “pangenesis”) that pass from
every</p>
<ul>
<li>References in the History of Animals indicate that Aristotle
prepared a volume of ana- tomical sketches, and that some of them were
reproduced on the walls of the Lyceum; his text uses letters, in modern
style, to refer to various organs or points in the drawings.</li>
</ul>
<p>t Aristotle failed to distinguish between ovaries and uterus; but his
description was not materially bettered before the work of Stensen in
1669.</p>

<p>If you wish, try this experiment. Take twenty or more eggs and</p>
<p>let them be incubated by two or more hens. Then each day, from</p>
<p>the second to that of hatching, remove an egg, break it, and examine
it. . . . With the common hen the embryo becomes first visible after</p>

<p>When the egg is ten days old, the chick and all its parts are
distinctly visible.™</p>
<p>The human embryo, Aristotle believes, develops l ike the chick: “In
the same way the infant lies within its mother’s womb — for the nature
of the bird can be hkened to that of man.””” His theory of analogous
organs en - ables him to see the animal world as one: “A nail is the
analogue of a claw, a han d of a crab’s nipper, a feather of a fish’s
scale.’”” At times he comes close to a doctrine of evolution:</p>
<p>Nature proceeds litde by little from things lifeless to animal
life</p>
<p>in such a way that it is impossible to determine the exact line of
de- marcation. . . . Thus, next after lifeless things in the upward
scale</p>
<p>comes the genus of plants, relatively lifeless as compared with
ani-</p>
<p>mals, but alive as compared with corporeal objects. There is in</p>
<p>plants a continuous scde of ascent towards the animal. There are</p>
<p>certain objects in the sea concerning which one would be at a
loss</p>
<p>to determine whether they be animal or vegetable. . . . The
sponge</p>
<p>is in every respect like a vegetable. . . . Some animals are
rooted,</p>
<p>and perish if detached. … In regard to sensibility, some animals give
no sign of it, others indicate it obscurely. . . . And so throughout</p>
<p>the animal scale there is a graduated differentiation.”*</p>
<p>He considers the ape an intermediate form between man and other
vivip- arous animals.’” He rejects Empedocles’ notion of the natural
selection of accidental mutations; there is no fortuity in evolution;
the lines of devel- opment are determined by the inherent urge of each
form, species, and genus to develop itself to the fullest realization of
its nature. There is design, but it is less a guidance from without than
an inner drive or</p>
<p>“entelechy”* by which each thing is drawn to its natural
fulfillment.</p>
<p>Intermingled with these briUiant suggestions there are (as might be
ex- pected from the hindsight of twenty-three centuries) errors so
numerous, and some so gross, that we are warranted in suspecting that

<p>Whether through a sincere piety, or through a cautious respect for
the opinions of mankind, Aristotle becomes less of a scientist and more
of a meta- physician as he turns to the study of man. He defines the
soul {psyche), or vital principle as “the primary entelechy of an
organism”— i.e., the organism’s inherent and destined form, its urge and
directon of growth. The soul is not something added to, or residing in,
the body, it is coextensive with the body; it is the body itself in its
“powers of self -nourishment, self-growth, and self- decay”; it is the
sum of the functions of the organism; it is to the body as vision is to
the eye. ™ Nevertheless, this functional aspect is basic; it is the
functions that make the structures, the desires that mold the organs,
the soul that forms the body: “All natural bodies are organs of the
soul.”t™</p>
<p>The soul has three grades — nutritive, sensitive, and rational.
Plants share</p>
<p>• He was misled by the insensitivity of cerebral tissue to direct
stimulus.</p>
<p>t“The soul,” Aristode adds in a standing idealisdc aside, “is in a
certain way all existing things; for all things are either perceptions
or thou ghts.’”® Having bowed to Berkeley, Aristotle also bows to Hume:
“Mind is one and continuous in the sense in which tiie process of
thinking is so; and thinking is identical with the thoughts which are
its parts.”™</p>
<p>53^ THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>with animals and men the nutritive soul — the capacity for
self-nourishment and internal growth; animals and men have in addition
the sensitive soul — the capacity for sensation; the higher animals as
well as men have the “passive rational” soul — the capacity for the
simpler forms of intelligence; man alone has the “active rational” soul—
the capacity to generalize and originate. This last is a part or
emanation of that creative and rational power of the universe which is
God; and as such it cannot die. “^ But this immortality is impersonal;
what survives is the power, not the personality; the individual is a
unique and mortal compound of nutritive, sensitive, and rational
faculties; he achieves immortality only relatively, through
reproduction, and only impersonally, through death.*</p>
<p>Just as the soul is the “form” of the body, so God is the “form” or
“entelechy” of the world — its inherent nature, functions, and
purposes.t All causesj at last go back to the First Cause Uncaused, all
motions to the Prime Mover Un- moved; we must assume some origin or
beginning for the motion and power in the world, and this source is God.
As God is the sum and source of all motion, so he is the sum and goal of
all purposes in nature; he is the Final, as well as the First, Cause.
Everywhere we see things moving to specific ends; the front teeth grow
sharp to cut food, the molars grow flat to grind it; the eyelid winks to
protect the eye, the pupil expands in the dark to let in more light; the
tree sends its ro ots into the earth, its shoots toward the sun.“® As
the tree is drawn by its inherent nature, power, and purposes toward the
light, so the world is drawn by its inherent nature, power, and
purposes, which are God. God is not the creator of the material world,
but its energizing form; he moves it not from behind, but as an inner
direction or goal, as something be- loved moves the lover.^” Finally,
says Aristotle, God is pure thought, rational soul, contemplating itself
in the eternal forms that constitute at once the essence of the world,
and God.</p>
<p>The purpose of art, like that of metaphysics, is to capture the
essential form of things. It is an imitation or representation of
life,’“^ but no mechani - cal copy; that which it imitates is the soul
of the matter, not the body or matter itself; and through this intuition
and mirroring of essence even the representation of an ugly object may
be beautiful. Beauty is unity, the</p>

on this p oint are possible. The text follows the Cambridge Ancient
History, VI, 345; Grote, Aristotle, II, 233; and Rohde, Psyche, 493.</p>
<p>tThe essential aspect of anything, in Aristode as in Plato, is the
“form” (eidos), not the - tiality which acquires specific existence only
when actuated and determined by form.</p>
<p>4: Every effect, says Aristode, is produced by four causes: material
(the component stuff), efiicient (the agent or his act), formal (the
nature of the thing), and final (the goal). He gives a peculiar example:
“What is the material cause of a man? The menses” (i.e., the pro -
vision of an ovum) . “What is the efficient cause? The semen” (i.e., the
act of ins emination) . “What is the formal cause? The nature” (of the
agents involved) . “What is the final cause?</p>

<p>co-operation and symmetry of the parts in a whole. In drama this
unity is primarily a unity of action; the plot must concern itself with
one action chiefly, and may a^it other actions only to advance or
illuminate this cen- tral tale. If the work is to be of high excellence
the action must be noble or heroic. “Tragedy,” says Aristotle’s
celebrated definition, “is a repre - sentation of an action that is
heroic and complete and of a certain magni- tude, by means of language
enriched with all kinds of ornament … it rep- resents men in action, and
does not use narrative; and through pity and fear it brings relief to
these and similar emotions.’”” By arousing our pro - foundest feelings,
and then quieting them through a subsiding denouement, the tragic drama
offers us a harmless and yet soul-deepening expression of emotions that
might otherwise accumulate to neurosis or violence; it shows us pains
and sorrows more awful than our own, and sends us home dis- charged and
cleansed. In general there is a pleasure in contemplating any work of
true art; and it is the mark of a civilization to provide the soul with
works worthy of such contemplation. For “nature requires not only that
we should be properly employed, but that we should be able to enjoy our
leisure in an honorable way.’””</p>
<p>What, then, is the good life? Aristotle answers, with frank
simplicity, that it is the happy life; and he proposes to consider, in
his Ethics* not (like Plato) how to make men good, but how to make them
happy. All other things than happiness, he thinks, are sought with some
other end in v iew; happiness alone is sought for its own sake.’”
Certain things are neces - sary to lasting happiness: good birth, good
health, good looks, good luck, good reputation, good friends, good
money, and goodness.*” “No man can be happy who is absolutely ugl y.’””
“As for those who say that he who is being tortured on the wheel, or
falls into great misfortunes, is happy pro- vided only he be good, they
talk nonsense.’”” Aristotle quotes, with a can - dor rare in
philosophers, the answer of Simonides to Hiero n’s wife, who had asked
whether it was better to be wise or to be rich: “Rich, for we see the
wise spending their time at the doors of the rich.’”” But wealth is
merely means; it does not of itself satisfy anyone but the miser; and
since it is relative, it seldom satisfies a man long. The secret of
happiness is action, the exercise of energy in a way suited to a man’s
nature and circumstances. — were used by the Greek editors to suggest

<p>to find the mean, and self-control {enkrateia, inner strength) to
practice it. “He who is angry at what and with whom he ought,” says a
typically</p>
<p>Aristotelian sentence, “and further, in right manner and time, and
for a proper length of time, is praised.””* Virtue is not an act but a
habit of doing the right thing. At first it has to be enforced by
discipline, since the young cannot judge wisely in these matters; in
time that which was the result of compulsion becomes a habit, “a second
nature,” and almost as pleasant as desire.</p>
<p>Aristotle concludes, quite contrary to his initial placing of
happiness in action, that the best life is the life of thought. For
thought is the mark or special excellence of man, and “the proper work
of man is a working of the soul in accordance with reason.””^ “The most
fortunate of men is he who combines a measure of prosperity with
scholarship, research, or con- templation; such a man comes closest to
the life of the gods.””* “Those who wish for an independent pleasure
should seek it in philosophy, for all other pleasures need the
assistance of men.””*</p>
<p>4 . The Statesman</p>
<p>As ethics is the science of individual happiness, so politics is the
science of collective happiness. The function of the state is to
organize a society for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. “A
state is a co llective body of citizens sufficient in themselves for all
the purposes of life.””* It is a natural product, for “man is by nature
a political animal””*— i.e., his in- stincts lead him to association.
“The state is by nature prior to the family and the individual”: man as
we know him is bom into an already organized society, which molds him in
its image.</p>
<p>Having collected and studied, with his students, 158 Greek constitu-
tions,* Aristotle divided them into three types: monarchy, aristocracy,
and timocracy — government respectively by power, by birth, and by
excel- lence. Any one of these forms may be good according to time,
place, and circumstance. “Though one form of government may be better
than oth - ers,” reads a sentence which every American should memorize,
“yet there is no reason to prevent another from being preferable to it
under particular conditions.””* Each form of government is good when the
ruling power seeks the good of all rather than its own profit; in the
contrary case each is bad. Each type, therefore, has a degenerate
analogue when it becomes government for the governors instead of for the
governed; then monarchy</p>
<p>• Only one of these studies survives— the Athenaion Politeia, found
in 1891. It is an admir- able constitutional history of Athens.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 535</p>
<p>lapses into despotism, aristocracy into oligarchy, timocracy into
democracy in the sense of rule by the common man.*” When the single
ruler is good and able, monarchy is the best form of government; when he
is a selfish autocrat we have tyranny, which is the worst form of
government. An aristocratic government may be beneficial for a time, but
aristocracies tend to deteriorate. “Noble character is now seldom found
among those of</p>
<p>noble birth, most of whom are good for nothing Highly gifted
families</p>
<p>often degenerate into maniacs, as, for example, the descendants of
Alcibi- ades and the elder Dionysius; those that are stable often
degenerate into fools and dullards, like the descenda nts of Cimon,
Pericles, and Socrates.”<em>® When aristocracy decays it is usually
replaced by a plutocratic oligarchy, which is government by wealth. This
is better than the despotism of a king or a mob; but it gives power to
men whose souls have been cramped by the petty calculations of trade, or
the villainous taking of interest,</em>® and issues, as like as not, in
the conscienceless exploitation of the poor.™ Democracy — which here
means government by the demos, by the com- mon citizen — is just as
dangerous as oligarchy, for it is based upon the pass- ing victory of
the poor over the rich in the struggle for power, and leads to a
suicidal chaos. Democracy is at its best when it is dominated by peasant
proprietors; it is at its worst when ruled by the urban rabble of
mechanics and tradesmen.™ It is true that the “multitude judge of many
things better than any one person, and that from their numbers they are
less liable to corruption, as water is from its quantity.”™ But
government requires spe - cial ability and knowledge; and “it is
impossible for one who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to
acquire excellence”™— i.e., good charac- ter, training, and judgment.
All men are created unequal; “equality is just, but only between
equals”;™ an d the upper classes will as readily make sedi- tions if an
unnatural equality is enforced, as the lower classes will rebel when
inequality is unnaturally extreme.*™ When a democracy is dom - inated by
the lower classes the rich are taxed to provide funds for the poor. “The
poor receive it and again want the same supply, while the giving it is
like pouring water into a sieve.”™ And yet a wise conservative will not
let people starve. “The true patriot in a democracy ought to take care
that the majority are not too poor … he should endeavor that they may
enjoy perpetual plenty; and as this is also advantageous to the rich,
what can be saved out of the public money should be divided among the
poor in such quantity as may enable each of them to buy a l ittle
field.”™</p>
<p>• Even slavery is legitimate, Aristotle thinks; as it is right that
the mind should rule the</p>
<p>53^ the life of GREECE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Having thus given back almost as much as he took away, Aristotle
offers some modest recommendations, not for a utopia but for a
moderately better society.</p>
<p>We proceed to inquire what form of government and manner of</p>
<p>life is best for communities in general, not adapting it to that
su-</p>
<p>perior virtue which is above the reach of the common people, or</p>
<p>that education which only every advantage of nature and fortune</p>
<p>can furnish, nor to those imaginary plans which may be formed at</p>
<p>pleasure; but to that mode of life which the greater part of mankind
can attain to, and that government which most cities may
establish.*^</p>
<p>. . . Whoever would establish a government upon community of</p>
<p>goods ought to consult the experience of many years, which would</p>
<p>plainly enough inform him whether such a scheme is useful; for
al-</p>
<p>most all things have already been found out.“® . . . What is common
to many is taken least care of; for all men have greater regard for</p>
<p>what is their own than for what they possess in common with</p>
<p>others.^ … It is necessary to begin by assuming a principle of
general application, viz., that the part of the state which desires the
con-</p>
<p>tinuance of the new constitution ought to be stronger than that</p>
<p>which does not.’*^ … It is plain, then, that those states are
best</p>
<p>instituted wherein the middle classes are a larger and more formid-
able part than either the rich or the poor. . . . Whenever the num-</p>
<p>ber of those in the middle state has been too small, those who were
the more numerous, whether the rich or the poor, always over-</p>
<p>powered them, and assumed to themselves the administration of</p>
<p>public affairs. . , . When either the rich get the better of the
poor,</p>
<p>or the poor of the rich, neither of them will establish a free
state.*®</p>
<p>To avoid these illiberal dictatorships from above or below, Aristotle
pro- poses a “mixed constitution” or “timocracy”— a combination of
aristocracy and democracy, in which the suffrage will be restricted to
landowners, and a strong middle class will be the bala nce wheel and
pivot of power. “The land ought to be divided into two parts, one of
which should belong to the community in general, the other to the
individuals separately. All the citizens will own land; they “are to eat
at public tables in certain com - panies”; and only they shall vote or
bear arms. They will constitute a small minority — ten thousand at most
— of the population. “None of them should be permitted to exercise any
mechanic employment or live by trade, for these are ignoble, and destroy
excellence.”^® But “neither should they be husbandmen; . . . the
husbandmen should be a separate order of people”— presumably slaves. The
citizens will elect the public officials, and hold each</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE ZENITH OF PHILOSOPHY 537</p>
<p>to account at the end of his term. “Laws, properly enacted, should
define the issue of all cases as far as possible, and leave as little as
possible to the discretion of the judges. . . “It is better that law
should rule than any individual. . . . He who entrusts any man with the
supreme power gives it to a wild beast, for such his appetites sometimes
make him; passion influ- ences those who are in power, even the very
best of men; but law is reason without desire.””“ The state so
constructed shall regulate proper ty, in- dustry, marriage, the family,
education, morals, music, literature, and art. “It is even more
necessary to take care that the increase of the people should not exceed
a certain number … to neglect this is to bring cer- tain poverty upon
the c itizens.””” “Nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up.””®
Out of these sound foundations will grow the flowers of civilization and
tranquillity. “Since the highest virtue is intelligence, the pre-eminent
duty of the state is not to train the citizens to military excel- lence,
but to educate them for the right use of peace.”*“</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to sit in judgment upon Aristotle’s work. Never
before, so far as we know, had anyone reared so impressive an edifice of
thought. When a man covers a vast field many errors may be forgiven him
if the result adds to our comprehension of life. Aristotle’s faults— or
those of the volumes that we perhaps wrongly count as the considered
product of his pen — are too obvious to need retailing. He is a
logician, but is quite capable of bad reasoning; he lays down the laws
of rhetoric and poetry, but his books are a jungle of disorder, and no
breath of imagination stirs their dusty leaves. And yet, if we penetrate
this verbiage we find a wealth of wisdom, and an intellectual industry
that opened many paths in the country of the mind. He did not quite
found biology, or constitutional history, or literary criticism — there
are no beginnings — but he did more for them than any other ancient whom
we know. To him science and philosophy owe a multitude of terms that in
their Latin forms have facilitated learned com- munication and thou^t —
principle, maxim, faculty, mean, category, energy, motive, habit, end He
was, as Pater called him, “the first of the School -</p>
<p>men”;*“ and his long ascendancy over philosophical method and
speculation suggests the fertility of his ideas and the depth of his
insight. His treatises on ethics and politics stand above every rival in
fame and influence. When all deductions have be en made he still remains
“the master of those who know,” an encouraging testimony to the elastic
range of the human in - tellect, and a comforting inspiration to those
who labor to bring man’s scattered knowledge together into perspective
and understanding.</p>
