<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>The Age of Petrarch and Boccaccio</p>
<p>1 3 ° 4 - 75</p>
<p>I. THE FATHER OF THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>I N that same year 1302 in which the aristocratic party of the
neri</p>
<p>(Blacks), having seized the government of Florence by force,
exiled</p>
<p>Dante and other middle-class bianchi (Whites), the triumphant
oligarchy indicted a White lawyer, Ser (i.e., Messer or Master) Petracco
on the charge of having falsified a legal document. Branding the
accusation as a device for ending his political career, Petracco refused
to stand for trial. He was convicted in absence, and was given the
choice of paying a heavy fine or having his right hand cut off. As he
still refused to appear before the court, he was banished from Florence,
and suffered the confiscation of his property. Taking his young wife
with him, he fled to Arezzo. There, two years later, Francesco Petrarca
(as he later euphonized his name) burst upon the world.</p>
<p>Predominantly Ghibelline — yielding political allegiance to the
emperors of the Holy Roman Empire rather than to the popes — little
Arezzo ex- perienced in the fourteenth century all the tribulations of
an Italian city. Guelfic Florence — supporting the popes against the
emperors in the strug- gle for political authority in Italy — had
overwhelmed Arezzo at Campaldino (1289), where Dante fought; in 1340 all
Aretine Ghibellines between thir- teen and seventy were exiled; and in
1384 Arezzo fell permanently under Florentine rule. There, in ancient
days, Maecenas had been bom; there the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
would see the birth of Giorgio Vasari, who made the Renaissance famous,
and of Pietro Aretino, who for a while made it infamous. Every town in
Italy has fathered genius, and banished it.</p>
<p>In 1312 Ser Petracco rushed north to welcome the Emperor Henry VII as
one who would save Italy, or at least its Ghibellines. As sanguine as
Dante in that year, Petracco moved his family to Pisa, and awaited the
de- struction of the Florentine Guelfs.</p>
<p>Pisa was still among the splendors of Italy. The shattering of her
fleet by the Genoese in 1284 had reduced her possessions and narrowed
her com-</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>merce; and the strife of Guelf and Ghibelline within her gates left
her with scant strength to elude the imperialistic grasp of a mercantile
Florence eager to control the Arno to its mouth. But her brave burghers
gloried in their majestic marble cathedral, their precarious campanile,
and their famous cemetery, that Campo Santo, or Sacred Field, whose
central quadrangle had been filled with soil from the Holy Land, and
whose walls were soon to re- ceive frescoes by Giotto’s pupils and the
Lorenzetti, and whose sculptured tombs gave a moment’s immortality to
the heroic or lavish dead. In Pisa’s university, soon after its
establishment, the subtle jurist Bartolus of Sasso- ferrato adapted
Roman law to the needs of the age, but phrased his legal sci- ence in
such esoteric verbiage as brought both Petrarch and Boccaccio down upon
his head. Perhaps Bartolus found obscurity prudent, since he justified
tyrannicide, and denied the right of governments to take a man’s
property except by due process of law. 1</p>
<p>Henry VII died (1313) before he could make up his mind to be or not
to be a Roman emperor. The Guelfs of Italy rejoiced; and Ser Petracco,
unsafe in Pisa, emigrated with his wife, his daughter, and his two sons
to Avignon on the Rhone, where the newly established papal court, and a
rapidly expanding population, offered opportunities for a lawyer’s
skill. They sailed up the coast to Genoa, and Petrarch never forgot the
unfolding splendor of the Italian Riviera — towns like diadems on
mountain brows, slipping down to green blue seas; this, said the young
poet, “is liker to heaven than t o earth.” 2 They found Avignon so
stuffed with dignitaries that they moved some fifteen miles northeast to
Carpentras (1315); and there Francesco spent four years of happy
carelessness. Bliss ended when he was sent off to Montpellier (1319-23),
and then to Bologna (1323-6) to study law.</p>
<p>Bologna should have pleased him. It was a university town, full of
the frolic of students, the odor of learning, the excitement of
independent thought. Here in this fourteenth century were given the
first courses in human anatomy. Here were women professors, some, like
Novella d’ An - drea (d. 1366), so attractive that tradition, doubtless
fanciful, described her as lecturing behind a veil lest the students
should be distracted by her beauty. The commune of Bologna had been
among the first to throw off the yoke of the Holy Roman Empire and
proclaim its autonomy; as far back as 1153 it had chosen its own podesta
or city manager; and for two centuries it had maintained a democratic
government. But in 1325, while Petrarch was there, it suffered so
disastrous a defeat by Modena that it placed itself under the protection
of the papacy, and in 1327 accepted</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>a papal vicar as its governor. Thereby would hang many a bitter
tale.</p>
<p>Petrarch liked the spirit of Bologna, but he hated the letter of the
law. “It went against my bent painfully to acquire an art that I would
not</p>
<p>practise dishonestly, and could hardly hope to practise otherwise.” 2
* All that he cared for i n the legal treatises was their “numberless
references to Roman antiquity.” Instead of studying law he read all that
he could find of Virgil, Cicero, and Seneca. They opened to him a new
world, both of philosophy and of literary art. He began to think like
them, he longed to write like them. When his parents died (1326) he
abandoned law, returned to Avignon, and steeped himself in classic
poetry and romantic love.</p>
<p>It was on Good Friday of 1 327, he tells us, that he saw the woman
whose withheld charms made him the most famous poet of his age. He
described her in fascinating detail, but kept the secret of her identity
so well that even his friends thought her the invention of his muse, and
counted all his passion as poetic license. But on the flyleaf of his
copy of Virgil, jealously treas- ured in the Ambrosian Library at Milan,
may still be seen the words that he wrote in 1 348:</p>
<p>Laura, who was distinguished by her virtues, and widely cele-</p>
<p>brated by my songs, first appeared to my eyes … in the year of
Our</p>
<p>Lord 1327, on the sixth day of April, at the first hour, in the
church</p>
<p>of Santa Clara at Avignqn. In the same city, in the same month,
on</p>
<p>the same sixth day, at the same first hour, in the year 1 348, that
light was taken from our day.</p>
<p>Who was this Laura? A will was filed in Avignon on April 3, 1 348, by
one Laura de Sade, wife of Count Hugues de Sade, to whom she had given
twelve children; presumably this was the lady of the poet’s love, and
her husband was a distant ancestor of the most famous sadist in history.
A miniature attributed to Simone Martini, and now in the Laurentian
Library at Florence, is described by tradition as a portrait of
Petrarch’s Laura; it shows a face of delicate beauty, fine mouth,
straight nose, and lowered eyes suggesting a pensive modesty. We do not
know if Laura was married, or already a young mother, when Petrarch
first saw her. In any case she re- ceived his adoration calmly, kept him
at a distance, and gave his passion all the encouragement of denial. The
occasional sincerity of his feeling for her is suggested by his later
remorse over its sensual elements, and his gratitude for the refining
influence of this unrequited love.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he lived in Provence, the land of the troubadours; the
echoes of their songs still lingered in Avignon; and Petrarch, like the
young Dante</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>a generation before him, became unconsciously a troubadour^ wedding
his passion to a thousand tricks of verse. The writing of poetry was
then a popular pastime; Petrarch complained, in one of his letters, that
lawyers and theologians, nay, even his own valet, had taken to rhyming;
soon, he feared, “the very cattle would begin to low in verse.” 3 From
his own coun - try he inherited the sonnet form, and bound it into the
difficult rhyme- pattern that for centuries molded and hampered Italian
poetry. Walking along the streams or among the hills, kneeling
distracted at Vespers or Mass, groping his way among verbs and
adjectives in the silence of his room, he composed during the next
twenty-one years 207 sonnets and sundry other poems on the living,
breeding Laura. Gathered in manuscript copies as a Canzoniere or
Songbook, these compositions caught the fancy of Italian youth, of
Italian manhood, of the Italian clergy. No one was disturbed by the fact
that the author, seeing no road to advancement except in the Church, had
taken the tonsure and minor orders, and was angling for a benefice; but
Laura may have blushed — and thrilled — on hearing that her hair and
brow and eyes and nose and lips . . . were sung from the Adriatic to the
Rhone. Never before, in the salvaged literature of the world, had the
emotion of love been expounded in such diverse fullness, or with such
painstaking artifice. Here were all the pretty conceits of versified
desire, the fitful flame of love miraculously trimmed to meter and
rhyme:</p>
<p>No rock, however cold, but with my theme</p>
<p>Shall henceforth kindle and consume in sighs!</p>
<p>But the Italian people received these bonbons in the most exquisite
music that their language had yet heard — subtle and delicate and
melodious, gleaming with bright imagery, making even Dante seem at times
crude and harsh; now, indeed, that glorious language — the triumph of
the vowel over the consonant — reached a height of beauty that even to
our day remains unsealed. An alien can translate the thought, but who
shall translate the music?</p>
<p>In qual parte del del, in quale idea</p>
<p>Era Fessempio, onde Natura tolse</p>
<p>Quel bel viso leg giadro, in ch’ ella volse</p>
<p>Mostrar qua giu quanto lassu potea?</p>
<p>Qual ninja in fonti, in selve mai qual dea,</p>
<p>Chiome d’oro so fino a l’ aura sdolse?</p>
<p>Quando un cor tante in se vertuti accolse?</p>
<p>Benche la somma e di mia morte rea.</p>

<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>Per divina bellezza indamo mira</p>
<p>Chi gli occhi de costei gia mai non vide</p>
<p>Come soavemente ella gli gira;</p>
<p>Non sa come Amor sana , e come ancide ,</p>
<p>Chi ?ion sa come dolce ella sospira ,</p>
<p>E come dolce parla , e dolce ride**</p>
<p>His poems, his gay wit, his sensitivity to beauty in woman, nature,
con- duct, literature, and art, made a place for Petrarch in cultured
society; and his condemnation of ecclesiastical morals in Avignon did
not deter great churchmen like Bishop Giacomo Colonna, and a brother
Cardinal Giovanni Colonna, from offering him hospitality and patronage.
Like most of us he enjoyed and condoned before he tired and condemned;
between sonnets to Laura he dallied with a mistress, and begot two
illegitimate children. He had leisure for travel, and apparently
substantial funds; we find him in Paris in 1331, then in Flanders and
Germany, then in Rome (1336) as the guest of the Colonnas. He was deeply
moved by the ruins of the Forum, reveal- ing an ancient power and
grandeur that shamed the poverty and squalor of the abandoned medieval
capital. He pled with five successive popes to leave Avignon and return
to Rome. He himself, however, left Rome and re- turned to Avignon.</p>
<p>For seven years, between his travels, he lived in the palace of
Cardinal Colonna there, meeting the finest scholars, churchmen, lawyers,
and states- men of Italy, France, and England, and conveying to them
some of his enthusiasm for classical literature. But he resented the
simoniacal corrup- tion of Avignon, the consuming leisure of
ecclesiastical litigation, the con- fusion of cardinals and courtesans,
the conversion of Christianity to the world. In 1337 he bought a small
house at Vaucluse — “Closed Valley”— some fifteen miles east of Avignon.
Traveling through majestic views to</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>locate that hideaway, one is surprised to find it a tiny cottage
built against a cliff, oppressed by massive crags, but caressed by the
quiet flow of the un- dulant Sorgue. Petrarch foreshadowed Rousseau not
only in the senti- mental involution of his love, but in the pleasure he
derived from natural scenery. “Would that you could know,” he wrote to a
friend, “with</p>
<p>what delight I wander, free and alone, among the mountains, forests,
and streams.” Already in 1336 he had set a fashion by climbing Mt.
Ventoux (6214 feet high), purely for the exercise, the view, and the
vanity of vic- tory. Now at Vaucluse he dressed like a peasant, fished
in the brook, put- tered in two gardens, and contented himself “with a
single dog and only two s ervants.” His sole regret (for his passion for
Laura had spent itself in hunting rhymes) was that he was too far from
Italy and too near</p>
<p>Avignon.</p>
<p>From that foot of land he moved half the literary world. He loved to
write long letters to his friends, to popes and kings, to dead authors,
to un- born posterity. He kept copies of this correspondence, and in his
declining years he amused his pride by revising it for posthumous
publication. These epistles, in vigorous but hardly Ciceronian Latin,
are the most vital relics of his pen. Some of them so harshly criticized
the Church that Petrarch kept them secret till he was safely dead. While
accepting with apparent sin- cerity the full doctrine of Catholic
Christianity, he dwelt in spirit with the ancients; he wrote to Homer,
Cicero, Livy as if they were living comrades, and complained that he had
not been born in the heroic days of the Roman Republic. He habitually
called one of his correspondents Laelius, and an- other Socrates. He
inspired his friends to search for lost manuscripts of Latin or Greek
literature, to copy ancient inscriptions, and collect ancient coins, as
precious documents of history. He urged the establishment of public
libraries. He practised what he preached: on his travels he sought and
bought classic texts as “more valuable merchandise than anything offered
by the Arabs or the Chinese”; 8 he transcribed unpurchasable manu -
scripts with his own hand; and at home he hired copyists to live with
him. He gloried in a Homer sent him from Greece, begged the sender for a
copy of Euripides, and made his copy of Virgil a vade viecum on whose
flyleaf he entered events in the careers of his friends. The Middle Ages
had pre- served, and some medieval scholars had loved, many pagan
classics; but Petrarch knew from references in these works that
numberless masterpieces had been forgotten or mislaid; and it became his
passion to recover them.</p>
<p>Renan called him “the first modern man,” as having “inaugurated in
the</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>CHAP. I ) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>Latin West a tender feeling for ancient culture.” 7 This will not do
as a definition of modernity, which did not merely rediscover the
classic world, but replaced the supernatural with the natural as the
focus of human con- cern. In this sense too Petrarch may deserve the
epithet “modem”; for though moderately pious, and occasionally worried
about the afterlife, his revival of interest in antiquity fostered the
Renaissance emphasis on man and the earth, on the legitimacy of sensory
pleasure, and on mortal glory as a substitute for personal immortality.
Petrarch had some sympathy for the medieval view, and in his dialogues
De contemptu mundi he let St. Augustine expound it well; but in those
imaginary conversations he made himself the defender of secular culture
and earthly fame. Though Petrarch was already seventeen when Dante died,
an abyss divided their moods. By common consent he was the first
humanist, the first writer to express with clarity and force the right
of man to concern himself with this life, to enjoy and augment its
beauties, and to labor to deserve well of posterity. He was the Father
of the Renaissance.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>NAPLES AND BOCCACCIO</li>
</ol>
<p>At Vaucluse Petrarch began the poem by which he aspired to rival
Virgil — an epic, Africa, on the liberation of Italy through the victory
of Scipio Africanus over Hannibal. Like the humanists of a century after
him, he chose Latin as his medium, not, like Dante, Italian; he wished
to be under- stood by the whole literate Western world. As the poem
progressed he became more and more doubtful of its merit; he never
completed it, never published it. While he was absorbed in Latin
hexameters his Italian Canzo- niere was spreading his fame through
Italy, and a translation carried his name through France. In 1 340 — not
without some sly manipulations on his part 8 — two invitations reached
him, one from the Roman Senate, the other from the University of Paris,
to come and receive at their hands the poet’s laurel crown . He accepted
the Senate’s offer, and the suggestion of Robert the Wise that he should
stop at Naples on the way.</p>
<p>After the overthrow of Frederick II and the Hohenstaufens by the arms
and diplomacy of the popes, his Regno — Italy south of the Papal States
— had been given to the house of Anjou in the person of Charles, Count
of Provence. Charles ruled as King of Naples and Sicily; his son Charles
II lost Sicily to the house of Aragon; his grandson Robert, though
failing in his war to recapture Sicily, earned his cognomen by competent
government,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>wise diplomacy, and a discriminating patronage of literature and art.
The Kingdom was poor in industry, and its agriculture was dominated by
myopic landowners who, as now, exploited the peasantry to the edge of
revolution; but the commerce of Naples gave the court an income that
made the royal Castel Nuovo ring with frequent festivities. The
well-to-do imitated the court; marriages became ruinous ceremonies;
periodic regattas animated the historic bay; and in the city square
young blades jousted in perilous tournaments while their garlanded
ladies smiled upon them from bannered balconies. Life was pleasant in
Naples, and morals were com- fortably loose; women were beautiful and
accessible; and poets found in this atmosphere of amorous dalliance many
a theme and stimulus for their verse. In Naples Boccaccio was
formed.</p>
<p>Giovanni had begun life in Paris as the unpremeditated result of
an</p>
<p>entente cordiale between his father, a Florentine merchant, and a
French lass of doubtful name and morals; 9 perhaps his bastard birth and
half-French origin shared in determining his character and history. He
was brought in infancy to Certaldo, near Florence, and suffered an
unhappy childhood under a stepmother. At the age of ten (1323) he was
sent to Naples, where he was apprenticed to a career of finance and
trade. He learned to hate business as Petrarch hated law; he announced
his preference for poverty and poetry, lost his soul to Ovid, feasted on
the Metamorphoses and the Heroides, and learned by heart most of the Ars
amandi, wherein, he wrote, “the greatest of poets shows how the sacred
fire of Venus may be made to burn in the coldest” breast. 10 The father,
unable to make him love money more than beauty, allowed him to quit
business on condition that he study canon law. Boccaccio agreed, but he
was ripe for romance.</p>
<p>The gayest lady in Naples was Maria d’ Aquino. She was the
natural</p>
<p>daughter of King Robert the Wise, 11 but her mother’s husband
accepted her as his own child. She was educated in a convent, and was
married at fifteen to the Count of Aquino, but found him inadequate to
her needs. She encouraged a succession of lovers to supply his
deficiencies, and to spend their substance upon her finery. Boccaccio
first saw her at Mass on Holy Saturday (1331) four Easters after
Petrarch’s discovery of Laura under similarly sacred auspices. She
seemed to him fairer than Aphrodite; the world held nothing lovelier
than her blonde hair, nothing more alluring than her roguish eyes. He
called her Fiammetta — Little Flame — and longed to singe himself in her
fire. He forgot canon law, forgot all the command- ments he had ever
learned; for months he thought only of how he might be near her. He went
to church solely in the hope that she might appear; he</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>paced the street before her window; he went to Baiae on hearing that
she was there. For five years he pursued her; she let him wait until
other purses were empty; then she allowed him to persuade her. A year of
costly assig- nations dulled the edge of adultery; she complained that
he looked at other women; besides, his funds ran out. The Little Flame
sought other food, and Boccaccio retired to poetry.</p>
<p>Very probably he had read Petrarch’s Canzoniere and Dante’s Vita</p>
<p>Nuova; his first poems were like theirs, sonnets of yearning,
burning, churn- ing love. Most of them were addressed to Fiammetta, some
celebrated lesser flames. For her he wrote a long and dreary prose
version — Filocopo — of a medieval romance, Fleur et Blancfleur. Finer
was his Filostrato; here he told in glowing verse how Criseida vowed
eternal fidelity to Troilus, was captured by the Greeks, and soon
yielded herself to Diomed on the plea that he was so “tall and strong
and beautiful,” and at hand. For his medium Boccaccio chose an
eight-line stanza — ottava rima — that set a form for Pulci, Boiardo,
and Ariosto. It is a frankly sensual story, whose 5400 lines reach their
climax when Criseida, “throwing away her shift, sprang naked into her
lover’s arms.” 12 But it is also a remarkable psychological study of one
type of woman — lightly false and gayly vain; and it ends with phrases
now familiar in opera:</p>
<p>Giovane donna e mobile, e vogliosa</p>
<p>E negli amanti molti, e sua bellezza</p>
<p>Estima piu cb ’ alio specchio, e pomposa . . . .</p>
<p>Virtu non sente ni conoscimento,</p>
<p>V olubil sempre come foglia al vento .*</p>
<p>Soon afterward, as if to break down resistance with sheer weight,
Boc- caccio presented to Fiammetta an epic poem, Teseide, precisely as
long as the Aeneid. It told of the bloody rivalry of two brothers,
Palemon and Arcite, for Emilia; the death of the victor in her loving
arms; and her acceptance of the loser after a proper delay. But even
heroic love palls after half the 9896 lines; and the English reader may
content himself with Chaucer’s judicious abbreviation of the story in
The Knight’s Tale.</p>
<p>Early in 1341 Boccaccio abandoned Naples for Florence. Two months
later Petrarch arrived at King Robert’s court. He basked awhile in the
royal shade, and then went on to seek a crown in Rome.</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE POET LAUREATE</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a pitiful capital of the world. The papacy having moved to</p>
<p>Avignon in 1309, no economic means remained of supporting even such
moderate splendor as the city had known in the thirteenth century. The
wealth that had trickled from a thousand bishoprics into streams from a
dozen states no longer flowed into Rome; no foreign embassies kept
palaces there; and rare was the cardinal who showed his face amid the
ruins of the Empire and the Church. Christian shrines rivaled classic
colonnades in di- lapidation; shepherds grazed their flocks on the
slopes of the seven hills; beggars roamed the streets and highwaymen
lurked along the roads; wives were abducted, nuns were raped, pilgrims
were robbed; every man carried arms. 13 The old aristocratic families —
Colonna, Orsini, Savelli, Annibaldi, Gaetani, Frangipani — contested
with violence and intrigue for political mastery in the oligarchic
Senate that ruled Rome. The middle classes were small and weak; and the
motley masses, mingled of a score of peoples, lived in a poverty too
stupefying to generate self-government. The hold of the absent papacy
upon the city was reduced to the theoretical authority of a legate, who
was ignored.</p>
<p>Amid this chaos and penury the mutilated remains of a proud antiquity
nourished the visions of scholars and the dreams of patriots. Some day,
the Romans believed, Rome would again be the spiritual and political
capital of the world, and the barbarians beyond the Alps would send
imperial tribute as well as Peter’s pence. Here and there men could
still spare a pittance for art: Pietro Cavallini adorned Santa A-laria
in Trastevere with remarkable mosaics, and in Santa Cecilia he
inaugurated a Roman school of fresco painting almost as important as
Duccio’s in Siena or Giotto’s in Florence. Even in Rome’s destitution
poets sang, forgetting the presen t for the past. After Padua and Prato
had restored Domitian’s rite of placing a laurel wreath upon the brow of
a favorite bard, the Senate thought it befitting the traditional primacy
of Rome to crown the man who by universal con- sent was the leading poet
of his nation and his time.</p>
<p>And so, on April 8, 1341, a colorful procession of youths and
senators escorted Petrarch — clad in the purple robe that King Robert
had given him — to the steps of the Capitol; there a laurel crown was
laid upon his head, and the aged Senator Stefano Colonna pronounced a
eulogy. From that day Petrarch had new fame and new enemies; rivals
plucked at his laurels with their pens, but kings and popes gladly
received him at their courts.</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 13</p>
<p>Soon Boccaccio would rank him with “the illustrious ancients”; and
Italy, proud of his renown, proclaimed that Virgil had been born
again.</p>
<p>What sort of man was he at this apex of his curve? In his youth he
had been handsome, and vain of his looks and clothes; in later years he
laughed at his once meticulous ritual of toilette and dress, and curling
of the hair, and squeezing of the feet into fancy shoes. In middle age
he grew a bit stout and doubled his chin, but his face had still the
charm of refinement and animation. He remained vain to the end, merely
pluming himself on his achievements instead of his appearance; but this
is a fault that only the greatest saints can shun. His letters, so
fascinating and brilliant, would have been more so without their sham
modesty and honest pride. Like all of us he relished applause; he longed
for fame, for literary “immortality”; so early, in this presage of the
Renaissance, he struck one of its most sustained notes, the thirst for
glory. He was a little jealous of his rivals, and de- scended to answer
their slurs. He fretted some (though he denied it) at Dante’s
popularity; he shuddered at Dante’s ferocity as Erasmus would at</p>
<p>Equipped with several ecclesiastical benefices, he was affluent
enough to despise wealth, and timid enough to like the literary
life.</p>
<p>There is no lighter burden, nor more agreeable, than a pen. Other</p>
<p>pleasures fail us, or wound us while they charm; but the pen we</p>
<p>take up rejoicing, and lay down with satisfaction; for it has the</p>
<p>power to advantage not only its lord and master but many others</p>
<p>as well, even though they be not born for thousands of years to</p>
<p>come. … As there is none among earthly delights more noble than</p>
<p>literature, so there is none more lasting, none gentler or more
faith- ful; none that accompanies its possessor through the vicissitudes
of life at so small a cost of effort or anxiety . 14</p>
<p>Yet he speaks of his “varying moods, which were rarely happy and
usually despondent .” 15 To be a great writer he had to be sensitive to
beauty in form and sound, in nature and woman and man; that is, he had
to suffer more than most of us from the noises and deformities of the
world. He loved music,- and played the lute well. He admired fine
painting, and numbered Simone Martini among his friends. Women must have
attracted him, for at times he spoke of them with almost anchoritic
fear. After forty, he as-</p>
<p>i4</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>sures us, he never touched a woman carnally. “Great must be the
powers of both body and mind,” he wrote, “that may suffice both to
literary activ - ity and to a wife.” 16</p>
<p>He offered no novel philosophy. He rejected Scholasticism as vain
logic- chopping far removed from life. He challenged the infallibility
of Aris- totle, and dared to prefer Plato. He went back from Aquinas and
Duns Scotus to the Scriptures and the Fathers, and relished the
melodious piety of Augustine and the Stoic Christianity of Ambrose;
however, he quoted Cicero and Seneca as reverently as he cited the
saints, and drew his argu- ments for Christianity most often from pagan
texts. He smiled at the dis- cord of philosophers, among whom he found
“no more agreement than among clocks.” 17 “Philosophy,” he complained,
“aims only at h air-splitting, subtle distinctions, quibbles of words.”
18 Such a discipline could make clever debaters, but hardly wise men. He
laughed at the high degree of Master and Doctor with which such studies
were crowned, and marveled how a ceremony could make a pundit out of a
fool. Almost in modem terms he rejected astrology, alchemy, demoniac
possession, prodigies, au- guries, dream prophecies, and the miracles of
his time. 19 He had the courage to praise Epicurus 20 in an age when
that name was used as a synonym for atheist. Now and then he spoke like
a skeptic, professing Cartesian doubt: “Distrustful of my own faculties
… I embrace doubt itself as truth . . . affirming nothing, and doubting
all things except those in which doubt is sacrilege.” 21</p>
<p>Apparently he made this exception in all sincerity. He expressed
no</p>
<p>doubt as to any dogma of the Church; he was too genial and
comfortable to be a heretic. He composed several devotional works, and
wondered had it not been better for him, like his brother, to ease his
way into heaven through monastic peace. He had no use for the
near-atheism of the Aver- roists in Bologna and Padua. Christianity
seemed to him an indisputable moral advance upon paganism, and he hoped
that men would find it pos- sible to be educated without ceasing to be
Christians.</p>
<p>The election of a new pope, Clement VI ( 1 342 ) , made it advisable
for Petrarch to return to Avignon and present his compliments and
expecta- tions. Following the precedent of awarding some benefices —
i.e., the in- come from ecclesiastical properties — for the support of
writers and artists, Clement gave the poet a priorate near Pisa, and in
1346 made him a canon of Parma. In 1343 he sent him on a mission to
Naples, and there Petrarch met one of the most unruly rulers of the
age.</p>
<p>Robert the Wise had just died, and his granddaughter Joanna I had
in-</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>herited his throne and dominions, including Provence and therefore
Avig- non. To please her father she had married her cousin Andrew, son
of the king of Hungary. Andrew thought he should be king as well as
consort; Joanna’s lover, Louis of Taranto, slew him (1345), and married
the Queen. Andrew’s brother Louis, succeeding to the throne of Hungar y,
marched his army into Italy, and took Naples (1348). Joanna fled to
Avignon, and sold that city to the papacy for 80,000 florins
(,000,000?); Clement de- clared her innocent, sanctioned her marriage,
and ordered the invader back to Hungary. King Louis ignored the order,
but the Black Death</p>
<ol start="1348" type="1">
<li>so withered his army that he was compelled to withdraw. Joanna
regained her throne (1352), and ruled in splendor and vice until deposed
by Pope Urban VI ( 1 380) ; a year later she was captured by Charles,
Duke of Durazzo, and in 1382 she was put to death.</li>
</ol>
<p>Petrarch touched this bloody romance only at its source, in the first
year of Joanna’s reign. He soon resumed his wandering, staying for a
while at Parma, then at Bologna, then ( 1 345) at Verona. There, in a
church library, he found a manuscript of Cicero’s lost letters to
Atticus, Brutus, and Quin - tus. In Liege he had already (1333)
disentombed Cicero’s speech Pro Archia — a paean to poetry. These were
among the most fruitful explora- tions in the Renaissance discovery of
antiquity.</p>
<p>Verona, in Petrarch’s time, might have been classed among the major
powers of Italy. Proud of her antiquity and her Roman theater (where one
may still, of a summer evening, hear opera under the stars), enriched by
the trade that came over the Alps and down the Adige, Verona rose under
the Scala family to a height where she threatened the commercial
supremacy of Venice. After the death of the terrible Ezzelino (1260) the
commune chose Mastino della Scala as podesta; Mastino was assassinated
in due course (1277), but his brother and successor Alberto firmly
established the rule of the Scaligeri (“ladder bearers,” from the apt
emblem of a climb - ing family), and inaugurated the heyday of Verona’s
history. Duri ng his reign the Dominicans began to build the lovely
church of Sant’ Anastasia; an obscure copyist unearthed the lost poems
of Catullus, Verona’s most fa - mous son; and the Guelf family of the
Capelletti fought the Ghibelline family of the Montechi, never dreaming
that they would become Shake- speare’s Capulets and Montagues. The
strongest and not the least noble of the Scala “despots” was Can Grande
della Scala, who made his court an asylum for exiled Ghibellines and a
haven for poets and scholars; there Dante for several years indignantly
climbed the shaky stairs of patronage. But Can Grande brought Vicenza,
Padua, Treviso, Belluno, Feltre, and</p>
<p>1 6</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Cividale under his power; Venice saw herself threatened with a
strangling encirclement; when Can Grande was succeeded by the less
ardent Mas- tino II she declared war, brought in Florence and Milan as
her allies, and forced Verona to surrender all but one of the conquered
towns. Can Grande II built the majestic Scaligero Bridge over the Adige,
with an arch whose span of 160 feet was then the largest in the world.
He was assassi- nated by his brother Consignorio, who followed this
fratricide with a wise and beneficent rule, and built the most ornate of
the famous tombs of the Scaligers. His sons divided the throne and
quarreled to the death; and in 1387 Verona and Vicenza were absorbed
into the duchy of Milan.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RIENZo’s REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Back in Avignon and Vaucluse (1345-7), Petrarch, still enjoying
the</p>
<p>friendship of the Colonnas, rejoiced to hear that revolution had
flared up in Rome, and that the son of a tavern keeper and a washerwoman
22 had de- posed the Colonnas and other aristocrats from power, and had
restored the glorious republic of the Scipios, the Gracchi, and Arnold
of Brescia.</p>
<p>Niccola di Rienzo Gabrini, known by the economy of popular speech as
Cola di Rienzo, and by a careless posterity as Rienzi, had met Petrarch
in 1 343 when, as a young notary of thirty years’ age, he had come to
Avigno n to acquaint Clement VI with the dire condition of Rome, and to
solicit for the Roman people the support of the papacy against the
feuding, maraud- ing nobles who dominated the capital. Clement, though
skeptical, had sent him back with encouragement and florins, hoping to
use the fervent law- yer in the recurrent conflict of the popes with the
aristocracy.</p>
<p>Rienzo, like Petrarch, had had his imagination fired by the ruins and
classics of Rome. Dressed in the white toga of an ancient senator, and
speaking with the ardor of the Gracchi and almost the eloquence of
Cicero, he pointed to the remains of the majestic forums and colossal
baths, and reminded the Romans of the time when consuls or emperors,
from these hills, had given laws and order urbi et orbi, to the city and
to the world; and he challenged them to seize the government, to restore
the popular as- sembly, and to elect a tribune strong enough to protect
them against the usurping nobility. The poor listened in awe; merchants
wondered might this potential tribune make Rome safe for industry and
trade; aristocrats laughed, and made Rienzo the butt of their dinner
jollity. He promised to hang a selection of them when the revolution
came.</p>
<p>To their consternation it came. On May 20, 1347 a concourse of
Ro-</p>
<p>i7</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE ACE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>mans crowded to the Capitol. Rienzo appeared before them escorted by
the bishop of Orvieto as vicar of the pope; he proclaimed the
restoration of the Republic and a distribution of alms; they elected him
dictator, and at a later meeting allowed him to take the old popular
title of tribune. The aged Senator Stefano Colonna protested; Cola
ordered him and the other nobles to leave the city; furious, but
respecting the armed revolutionaries, they withdrew to their country
estates. Delirious with success, Rienzo be- gan to speak of himself as
the divinely inspired “Illustrious Redeemer of the Holy Roman Republic
by the authority of . . . Jesus Christ.” 23</p>
<p>His administration was excellent. Food prices were regulated to check
profiteering; surplus corn was stored in the granaries; work was begun
to drain the malarial marshes and put the Campagna under cultivation.
New courts dealt out justice with impartial severity; a monk and a baron
were beheaded for equal felonies; a former senator was hanged for
robbing a merchant vessel; the cutthroats hired by noble factions were
arrested; a court of conciliation pacified in a few months 1 800 feuds.
Aristocrats ac- customed to being their own law were shocked to find
themselves held responsible for crimes committed on their estates; some
paid heavy fines; Pietro Colonna, dripping dignity, was led on foot to
jail. Judges guilty of malfeasance were exposed in public pillories.
Peasants tilled their fields in unwonted security and peace; merchants
and pilgrims en route to Rome kissed the insignia of the resurrected
Republic that made the highways safe after half a century of brigandage.
24 All Italy marveled at this intrepid transformation, and Petrarch
raised to Rienzo a paean of gratitude and praise.</p>
<p>Seizing his opportunity with bold statesmanship, the tribune
despatched envoys throughout the peninsula, inviting the cities to send
representatives who would form a great parliamen t to unite and govern
“the whole of sacred Italy” in a federation of municipalities, and to
make Rome again the capital of the world. To a preliminary council of
judges gathered from all Italy he submitted a question: might the Roman
Republic, now reconsti- tuted, rightfully reclaim all the privileges and
powers that in its decay had been delegated to other authorities?
Answered in the affirmative, Rienzo put through the popular assembly a
law restoring to the Republic all such grants of power. This grandiose
declaration, sweeping away a millennium of donations, abdications, and
coronations, threatened alike the Holy Ro- man Empire, the autonomous
cities, and the temporal power of the Church. Twenty- five communes sent
representatives to Rienzo’s pa rliament, but the major city-states —
Venice, Florence, Milan — hesitated to submit their sov-</p>
<p>i8</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>ereignty to a federation. Clement VI was pleased with the tribune’s
piety, his formal sharing of his authority with the bishop of Orvieto,
the protec- tion he gave to pilgrims, the prospects he held out of a
lucrative jubilee in 1350; but — he began to wonder — was not this
sanguine republican an im- practical idealist who would outreach himself
to ruin?</p>
<p>Amazing and pitiful was the collapse of the noble dream. Power, like
freedom, is a test that only a sober intelligence can meet. Rienzo was
too great an orator to be a realistic statesman; he came to believe his
own mag- nificent phrases, promises, and claims; he was poisoned by his
own periods. When the federative assembly met (August, 1347), he had
arranged that it should begin by conferring knighthood upon him. That
evening he pro- ceeded with his escort to the baptistery of St. John
Lateran, and plunged bodily into the great basin wherein, according to
legend, Constantine had washed away his paganism and his sins; then,
clad in white, he slept through the night on a public couch set up amid
the pillars of the church. On the morrow he issued to the assembly and
the world a decree declaring all the cities of Italy to be free,
endowing them with Roman citizenship, and re- serving exclusively to the
people of Rome and Italy the authority to elect an emperor. Drawing his
sword, he flourished it in three directions, saying, as the
representative of Rome, “That belongs to me, that to me, and that.”</p>
<p>Rienzo, exalted by success, more and more ignored and thrust aside
the papal representative whom he had associated with himself in office
and au- thority. Cardinals from Italy and from France warned Clement
that a unified Italy — and much more an empire ruled from Rome — would
make the Italian Church a prisoner of the state. On October 7 Clement
commis- sioned his legate Bertrand de Deux to offer Rienzo a choice
between depo- sition and the restriction of his powers to the secular
affairs of the city of Rome. After some resistance Cola yielded; he
promised obedience to the</p>
<p>i9</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>Pope, and withdrew the edicts that had annulled imperial and papal
privi- leges. Unmollified, Clement resolved to unseat the incalculable
tribune. On December 3 he published a bull stigmatizing Cola as a
criminal and a heretic, and called upon the Romans to banish him. The
legate suggested that if this should not be done no jubilee would be
proclaimed. Meanwhile the nobles had raised another army, which now
advanced upon Rome. Rienzo had the tocsin rung to call the people to
arms. Only a few came; many resented the taxes he had levied; some
preferred the profits of a jubi- lee to the responsibilities of freedom.
As the forces of the aristocracy neared the Capitol Rienzo’s wonted
courage waned; he discarded the insignia of his office, said good-by to
his friends, broke into tears, and shut himself up in the Castello Sant’
Angelo (December 1 5, 1 347). The triumphant nobles re-entered their
city palaces, and the papal legate named two of them as senators to rule
Rome.</p>
<p>Unmolested by the nobles but still under the ban of the Church,
Rienzo fled to Naples, and then to the mountain forests of the Abruzzi
near Sul- mona; there he donned the garb of a penitent, and for two
years lived as an anchorite. Then, surviving a thousand hardships and
tribulations, he made his way, secretly and in disguise, through Italy
and the Alps and Austria to the Emperor Charles IV at Prague. He
pronounced before him an angry indictment of the popes; to their absence
from Rome he attributed the anarchy and poverty of that city, and to
their temporal power and policy the abiding division of Italy. Charles
rebuked him and defended the popes; but when Clement demanded that Cola
be sent as a papal prisoner to Avignon Charles kept him in protective
confinement in a fortress on the Elbe. After a year of unbearable
inactivity and isolation Cola asked to be sent to the papal court. On
his journey to Avignon crowds flocked to see him, and gallant knights
offered to guard him with their swords. On Au- gust 10, 1352, he reached
Avignon in such miserable raiment that all men pitied him. He asked for
Petrarch, who was at Vaucluse; the poet re- sponded by issuing to the
people of Rome a clarion call to protect the man who had offered them
liberty.</p>
<p>To the Roman people . . . invincible . . . conquerors of nations!</p>
<p>. . . Your former tribune is now a captive in the power of
strangers;</p>
<p>and — a sad spectacle indeed! — like a nocturnal thief or a traitor
to his country, he pleads his cause in chains. The highest of
earthly</p>
<p>tribunals refuses him the opportunity of a legitimate defense. . .
.</p>
<p>Rome assuredly does not merit such treatment. Her citizens, once</p>
<p>inviolable by alien law . . . are now indiscriminately maltreated;
and</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>this is done not only without the guilt that attaches to a crime,
but</p>
<p>even with the high praise of virtue. … He is accused not of
betray-</p>
<p>ing but of defending liberty; he is guilty not of surrendering but
of</p>
<p>holding the Capitol. The supreme crime with which he is charged,</p>
<p>and which merits expiation on the scaffold, is that he dared
affirm</p>
<p>that the Roman Empire is still at Rome, and in possession of the</p>
<p>Roman people. O impious age! O preposterous jealousy, malevo-</p>
<p>lence without precedent! What dost thou, O Christ! ineffable and</p>
<p>incorruptible judge of all? Where are thine eyes with which thou</p>
<p>art wont to scatter the clouds of human misery? . . . Why dost
thou</p>
<p>not, with thy forked lightning, put an end to this unholy trial?
20</p>
<p>Clement did not ask for Cola’s death, but ordered him kept in custody
in the tower of the papal palace at Avignon. While Rienzo studied Scrip-
ture and Livy there, a new tribune, Francesco Baroncelli, seized power
in Rome, banished the nobles, flouted the papal legate, and allied
himself with the Ghibelline supp orters of the emperors against the
popes. Clement’s successor, Innocent VI, released Cola, and sent him to
Italy as an aide to Cardinal Albornoz, whom he charged with restoring
the papal authority in Rome. As the subtle cardinal and the subdued
dictator neared the capital a revolt was staged; Baroncelli was deposed
and killed, and the Romans turned over the city to Albornoz. The
populace welcomed Rienzo with arches of triumph and joyful acclamations
in crowded streets. Albornoz appointed him senator, and delegated to him
the secular government of Rome (1353).</p>
<p>But years of imprisonment had fattened the body, broken the courage,
and dulled the mind of the once brilliant and fearless tribune. His
policies cleaved to the papal line, and shunned the grand emprises of
his younger reign. The nobility still hated him, and the proletariat,
seeing in him now a cautious conservative cured of Utopia, turned
against him as disloyal to their cause. When the Colonna declared war
upon him, and besieged him in Palestrina, his unpaid troops verged on
mutiny; he borrowed money to pay them, raised taxes to redeem the debt,
and alienated the middle class. Hardly two months after his return to
power a revolutionary mob marched to the Capitol shouting “Long live t
he people! Death to the traitor Cola di Rienzo!” He came out of his
palace in knightly armor, and tried to control the crowd with eloquence.
But the rebels drowned his voice with noise, and showered him with
missiles; an arrow struck him in the head, and he withdrew into the
palace. The mob set fire to the doors, broke through them, and plundered
the rooms. Hiding in one of these, Rienzo hastily cut</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>off his beard, donned a porter’s cloak, and piled some bedding upon
his head. Emerging, he passed through part of the crowd unrecognized.
But his gold bracelet betrayed him, and he was led as a prisoner to the
steps of the Capitol, where he himself had condemned men to death. He
asked for a hearing, and began to move the people with his speech; but
an artisan fearful of eloquence cut him short with a sword thrust in the
stomach. A hundred demiheroes plunged their knives into his dead body.
The bloody corpse was dragged through the streets, and was hung up like
carrion at a butcher’s stall. It remained there two days, a target for
public contumely and urchins’ stones. 27</p>
<p>V. THE WANDERING SCHOLAR</p>
<p>Rienzo failed to restore ancient Rome, which was dead to all but
poetry; Petrarch succeeded in restoring Roman literature, which had
never died. He had so openly supported Cola’s revolt that he had
forfeited the favor of the Colonna in Avignon. For a time he thought of
joining Rienzo in Rome; he was as far on the way as Genoa when he heard
that the t ribune’s position and conduct were deteriorating. He changed
his course to Parma (1347). He was in Italy when the Black Death came,
taking many of his friends, and killing Laura in Avignon. In 1348 he
accepted the invitation of Iacopo II da Carrara to be his guest in
Padua.</p>
<p>The city had a burdensome antiquity; it was already hundreds of years
old when Livy was bom there in 59 b.c. It became a free commune in 1
174, suffered the tyranny of Ezzelino (1237-56), recovered its independ-
ence, sang litanies to liberty, and subjected Vicenza to its domination.
At- tacked and almost overcome by Can Grande della Scala of Verona, it
abandoned its freedom and chose as dictator Iacopo I da Carrara (1 318),
a man as hard as the marble that bore his name. Later members of the
family succeeded to his power by inheritance or assassination.
Petrarch’s host seized the reins in 1345 by murdering his predecessor,
tried to atone by good government, but was stabbed to death after four
years of rule. Fran- cesco I da Carrara (1350-89), in a remarkable reign
of almost forty years, raised Padua to a passing rivalry with Milan,
Florence, and Venice. He made the mistake of joining Genoa against
Venice in the bitter war of 1378; Venice won, and subjected Padua to her
rule (1404).</p>
<p>Meanwhile the city contributed more than its share to the cultured
life of Italy. The majestic church of St. Anthony, known affectionately
as II Santo, was completed in 1307. The great Salone, or Sala della
Ragione</p>
<p>22 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. I</p>

(13450, had 400 rooms, many with frescoes that were the pride of the
Carraresi; nothing remains of them but a tower whose celebrated clock
first chimed in 1364. At the beginning of the century an ambitious
merchant, Enrico Scrovegni, bought a palace in the old Roman
amphitheater known as the Arena, and summoned Italy’s most famous
sculptor, Giovanni Pisano , and her most famous painter, Giotto, to
decorate the chapel of his new home (1303-5); as a result the little
Arena Chapel is now known through- out the educated world. Here the
genial Giotto painted half a hundred murals, roundels, and medallions,
telling again the wondrous story of the Virgin and her Son, surrounding
the main frescoes with the heads of prophets and saints, and with ample
female forms symbolizing the virtues and vices of mankind. Over the
inner portal his pupils, with half-hearted seriousness, depicted the
Last Judgment in a carnal confusion of gargoyle- like grotesques.
Mantegna, decorating a chapel in the near-by church of the Eremitani a
century and a half later, may have smiled at the simple draftsmanship,
the primitive perspective, the monotonous similarity of faces, poses,
and figures, the imperfect sense and command of anatomy, the blonde
heaviness of nearly all the figures, as if the Lombards of Padua were
still Longobards freshly come from well-fed Germany. But the lovely fea-
tures of the Virgin in the Nativity, the noble head of Jesus in the
Raising of Lazarus, the stately high priest in The Wooers, the calm
Christ and coarse Judas of The Betrayal, the serene grace, harmonious
composition, and de- veloping action of the spacious panorama in color
and form, make these paintings — still fresh and clear after six
centuries — the first pictorial triumph of the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Petrarch may have seen the Arena frescoes; certainly he appreciated
Giotto, for in his will he left to Francesco da Carrara a Madonna “by

<p>individual soul, and spoke of Christianity as a useful superstition
privately discarded by educated men.</p>
<p>In 1348 we find our restless poet at Mantua, then at Ferrara. In 1350
he joined the flow of pilgrims bound for the jubilee in Rome. On the way
he visited Florence for the first time, and established a cordial
friendship with Boccaccio. Thereafter, said Petrarch, they “shared a
single heart.” 29 In 1351, on Boccaccio’s urging, the Florentine Signory
repealed the edict that</p>

</ol>
<p>It is difficult to love medieval Florence,* she was so hard and
bitter in industry and politics; but it is easy to admire her, for she
devoted her wealth to the creation of beauty. There, in the very youth
of Petrarch, the Ren- aissance was in full swing.</p>
<p>It developed in a stimulating atmosphere of business competition,
family feuds, and private violence unparalleled in the rest of Italy.
The population was divided by class war, and each class itself was split
into factions merci- less in victory and vengeful in defeat. At any
moment the defection of a few families from one parte to another would
tip the scales of power. At any moment some discontented element might
take to arms and try to oust the government; if successful it exiled the
leaders of the beaten party, usu- ally confiscated their property,
sometimes burned down their homes. But this economic strife and
political agitation were not all of Florentine life. Though more devoted
to their party than to their city, the citizens had a proud civic sense,
and spent much of their substance for the common good. Rich individuals
or guilds would pay for paving a street, constructing sewers, improving
the water supply, housing a public market, establishing or improving
churches, hospitals, or schools. An esthetic sense as keen as that of
the ancient Greeks or the modern French dedicated public and private
funds to the embellishment of the city with architecture, sculpture, and
painting, and to the interior adornment of homes with these and a dozen
minor arts. Florentine pottery led all Europe in this period. Florentine
goldsmiths decorated necks, bosoms, hands, wrists, girdles, altars,
tables, armor, coins with jewelry or intarsia or engraved or embossed
designs un- surpassed in that or any other age.</p>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>And now the artist, reflecting the new emphasis on personal ability
or virtu, stood out from the guild or the group, and identified his
product with his name. Niccolo Pisano had already freed sculpture from
limitation to ecclesiastical motives, and subservience to architectural
lines, by uniting a sturdy naturalism with the physical idealism of the
Greeks. His pupil Andrea Pisano cast for the Florentine Baptistery ( 1
300-6) two bronze half- doors depicting in twenty-eight reliefs the
development of the arts and sciences since Adam delved and Eve span; and
these fourteenth-century works survive comparison with Ghiberti’s
fifteenth - century “doors to Par - adise” on the same building. In 1334
the Florentine Signory approved the designs of Giotto for a tower to
bear the weight and scatter the chimes of the cathedral bells, and a
decree was passed, in the spirit of the age, that “the campanile should
be built so as to exceed in magnificence, height, and excellence of
workmanship everything of the kind achieved of old by the Greeks and
Romans when at the zenith of their greatness.” 30 The loveliness of the
tower lies not in its square and undistinguished form (which Giotto had
wished to top with a spire), but in the Gothic traceried windows, and
the reliefs, in colored marble, carved on the lower panels by Giotto,
Andrea Pisano, and Luca della Robbia. After Giotto’s death the work was
carried on by Pisano, Donatello, and Francesco Talenti, to whom the
tower owes the culminating beauty of its highest arcade (1359).</p>
<p>Giotto di Bondone dominated the painting of the fourteenth century as
Petrarch dominated its poetry; and the artist rivaled the poet in
ubiquity. Painter, sculptor, architect, capitalist, man of the world,
equally ready with artistic conceptions, practical devices, and humorous
repartee, Giotto moved through life with the confidence of a Rubens, and
spawned master- pieces in Florence, Rome, Assisi, Ferrara, Ravenna,
Rimini, Faenza, Pisa, Lucca, Arezzo, Padua, Verona, Naples, Urbino,
Milan. He seems never to have worried about obtaining commissions; and
when he went to Naples it was as the palace guest of the king. He
married and had ugly children, but this did not disturb the placid grace
of his compositions, or the cheerful tenor of his life. He leased looms
to artisans at twice the ordinary rental; 31 however, he told the story
of St. Francis, the apostle of poverty, in one of the outstanding works
of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>He was still a youth when Cardinal Stefaneschi called him to Rome to
design a mosaic — the celebrated Navicella, or Little Ship, showing
Christ saving Peter from the waves; it survives, considerably altered,
in the vesti- bule of St. Peter’s, inconspicuous above and behind the
portico colonnade. It was probably the same Cardinal who commissioned
the polyptych pre-</p>
<p>*5</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>served in the Vatican. These products show an immature Giotto,
vigorous in conception, weak in execution. Possibly a study of Pi etro
Cavallini’s mosaics in Santa Maria in Trastevere, and his fresco in
Santa Cecilia, helped to form Giotto in those Roman years; while the
naturalistic sculpture of Niccolo Pisano may have moved him to turn his
eyes from the works of his predecessors to the actual features and
feelings of living women and men. “Giotto appeared,” said Leonardo da
Vinci, “and drew what he saw,” 32 and the Byzantine petrifaction faded
from Italian art.</p>
<p>Moving to Padua, Giotto painted in three years the famous frescoes of
the Arena Chapel. Perhaps at Padua he met Dante; he may have known him
in Florence; Vasari, always interesting and sometimes accurate, calls
Dante the “close companion and friend” of Giotto, 33 and ascribes to
Giotto a portrait of Dante that formed part of a fresco in the
Florentine Bargello or Palace of the Podesta. The poet, with exceptional
amiability, celebrates the painter in The Divine Comedy. 3 *</p>
<p>In 1318 two banking families, the Bardi and the Peruzzi, engaged
Giotto to tell in frescoes the stories of St. Francis, St. John the
Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, in the chapels that they were
dedicating in the church of Santa Croce in Florence. These paintings
were whitewashed in later years; they were uncovered in 1853 and were
repainted, so that only the drawing and the composition are Giotto’s. A
like fate befell the celebrated</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>2 6</p>
<p>(chap. 1</p>
<p>generated a tradition ideally completed in the work of the Dominican
Fra Angelico.</p>
<p>All in all, Giotto’s work was a revolution. We feel his faults
because we know of the painting skills that were developed by the
movement that he began. His drawing, modeling, perspective, and anatomy
are painfully in- adequate; art, like the medical science of Giotto’s
time, was just beginning to dissect the human body, to learn the place,
structure, and function of each muscle, bone, tendon, nerve; men like
Mantegna and Masaccio would master these elements, and Michelangelo
would perfect them, almost make a fetish of them; but in Giotto’s day it
was still unusual to study, scandalous to represent, the nude. What is
it, then, that makes the work of Giotto in Padua and Assisi a landmark
in the history of art? It is the rhythmic compo- sition, drawing the eye
from every angle to the center of interest; the dignity of quiet motion,
the soft and luminous coloring, the majestic flow of the nar- rative,
the restraint of expression even in deep feeling, the grandeur of the
calm that bathes these troubled scenes; and, now and then, the
naturalistic portraiture of men, women, and children not as studied in
past art but as seen and felt in the movement of life. These were the
components of Giotto’s triumph over Byzan tine rigidity and gloom, these
were the secrets of his enduring influence. For a century after him
Florentine art lived on his example and his inspiration.</p>
<p>In his wake came two generations of Giotteschi, who imitated his
themes and style, but rarely touched his excellence. His godson and
pupil, Taddeo Gaddi, almost inherited art; Taddeo’s father, and three of
Taddeo’s five sons, were painters; the Italian Renaissance, like German
music, tended to run in families, and prospered there through the
transmission and accumu- lation of techniques in homes, studios, and
schools. Taddeo began as an apprentice to Giotto; by 1347 he was at the
head of Florentine painters; even then, however, he signed himself
devotedly “Discepol di Giotto il buon maestro.” 35 He became so rich
through his industry as painter and ar- chitect that his descendants
could afford to be patrons of art.</p>
<p>An impressive work long attributed to him but now ascribed to Andrea
da Firenze shows how, in this first century of the Renaissance, Italy
was still medieval. In the Capella degli Spagnuoli, or Chapel of the
Spaniards, in the church of Santa Maria Novella, the Dominican friars
set up about 1370 a pic- torial apotheosis of their famous philosopher.
St. Thomas Aquinas, comforta- bly substantial but too devoted to be
proud, stands in triumph, with the heretics Arius, Sabellius, and
Averroes groveling at his feet; around him Moses, Paul, John the
Evangelist, and other saints seem but accessories; below them</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>fourteen figures symbolize seven sacred and seven profane sciences —
Donatus grammar, Cicero rhetoric, Justinian law, Euclid geometry, and so
on. The thought is still completely medieval; only the art, in design
and color, shows the emergence of a new age from the old. The transition
was so gradual that not for a century yet would men feel themselves to
be in a different world.</p>
<p>The advance in technique is clearer in Orcagna, who stands second
only to Giotto among the Italian artists of the fourteenth century.
Named originally Andrea di Cione, he was called Arcagnolo — Archangel —
by his admiring con- temporaries, and lazy tongues shortened the
appellation to Orcagna. Though often listed among Giotto’s followers, he
was rather a pupil of the sculptor Andrea Pisano. Like the greatest
geniuses of the Renaissance he was a master of many arts. As a painter
he made a colorful altarpiece of Christ Enthroned for the Strozzi Chapel
in Santa Maria Novella, while his elder brother Nardo executed on the
walls vivid frescoes of heaven and hell (1354-7). As an archi- tect he
designed the Certosa or Carthusian monastery near Florence, famous for
its graceful cloisters and its Acciaiuoli tombs. As architects and
sculptors he and his brother executed the ornate tabernacle in the
Or(atory) San Michele in Florence. A picture of the Virgin there was
believed to work miracles; after the Black Death of 1348 the votive
offerings of survivors enriched the fra- ternity that managed the
building, and it was decided to house the picture in a sumptuous shrine
of marble and gold. The Cioni designed it as a miniature Gothic
cathedral, with columns, pinnacles, statues, reliefs, precious metal,
and costly stone; it is a jewel of trecento decoration.* Andrea,
acclaimed for it, was appointed capomaestro at Orvieto, and shared in
designing the facade of the cathedral. In 1362 he returned to Florence,
and worked there on the great duomo till his death.</p>
<p>The immense fame of Santa Maria del Fiore — the largest church that
had as yet been built in Italy — had been begun by Arnolfo di Cambio in
1296. A suc- cession of masters — Giotto, Andrea Pisano, Francesco
Talenti, and many others — labored on it till our time; its present
fagade dates from 1887; even now the cathedral is incomplete, and must
in good measure be rebuilt by every century. Architecture was the least
successful of the arts in Renaissance Italy; it took half-heartedly from
the north some elements of Gothic like the pointed arch, combined them
with classic columns, and sometimes, as in Florence, topped the whole
with a Byzantine dome. The mixture was incongruous and — barring some
small churches by Bramante — lacked unity and grace. The facade of
Orvieto and Siena were superb displays of sculpture and mosaic rather
than honest architecture; and the accentuation of horizontal lines by
the alternating strata of black and white marble in the walls depresses
eye and soul, when the very meaning of the church should have been a
prayer or paean rising to the</p>

<p>skies. Santa Maria del Fiore — as the Florentine cathedral was called
after 1412 from the lily in the heraldic emblem of the city — is hardly
a flower; it is, but for Brunellesco’s illustrious dome, a cavern, whose
dark vacuity might be the mouth of Dante’s Inferno instead of a ves
tibule to God.</p>
<p>It was the inexhaustible Arnolfo di Cambio who in 1294 began the
Fran- ciscan church of Santa Croce, or the Holy Cross, and in 1298 the
loveliest structure in Florence, the Palazzo della Signoria, known to
later generations as the Palazzo Vecchio. The church was finished in
1442 except for the facade (1863); the Palace of the Signory, or Old
Palace, was completed in its main features by 1314. Those were the years
that saw the banishment of Dante and Petrarch’s father; factional strife
was in its heyday; so Arnolfo built for the Signory a fortress rather
than a palace, and designed its roof with machicolated battlements;
while the unique campanile, by the diverse ringing of its bell, served
to call the citizens to parliament or to arms. Here the city fathers (
priori , signori) not only governed but lived; and the temper of the
time appears in the law that during their two months of office they were
not to leave the building on any pretext whatever. In 1 345 Neri di
Fioravante spanned the Arno with one of the world’s famous bridges, the
Ponte Vecchio, now cracked</p>

<p>It was in Florence that Italian literature achieved its first and
greatest triumphs. There Guinizelli and Cavalcanti, in the late
thirteenth century, gave the sonnet its finished form; not there, but
longing for it, Dante the Florentine struck the first and last true note
of Italian epic poetry; there Boccaccio composed the supreme work of
Italian prose, and Giovanni Villani wrote the most modern of medieval
chronicles. Visiting Rome for the jubilee of 1 300, and moved like
Gibbon by the ruins of a mighty past, Villani thought for a while of
recording its history; then, judging that Rome had been sufficiently
commemorated, he turned back to his native haunts, and resolved “to
bring into this volume … all the events of the city of Florence . . .
and give in full the deeds of the Florentines, and briefly the notable
affairs of the rest of the world.” 36</p>
<p>He began with the Tower of Babel and ended on the verge of the
Black</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 29</p>
<p>Death, in which he died; his brother Matteo and his nephew Filippo
con- tinued the story to 1365. Giovanni was well prepared; he came of a
pros- perous mercantile family, commanded a pure Tuscan speech, traveled
in Italy, Flanders, and France, served thrice as prior and once as
master of the mint. He had for those times an uncommon sense of the
economic bases and influences of history; and he was the first to salt
his narrative with statistics of social conditions. The first three
books of his Croniche Floren- tine are mostly legend; but in later books
we learn that in 1338 Florence and its hinterland had 105,000
inhabitants, of whom seventeen thousand were beggars and four thousand
were on public relief; that there were six primary schools, teaching ten
thousand boys and girls, and four high schools, in which six hundred
boys and a few girls studied “grammar” (literature) and “logic”
(philosoph y). Unlike most historians Villani included notices of new
books, paintings, buildings; seldom has a city been so directly de-
scribed in all the departments of its life. Had Villani brought all
these phases and details into one united narrative of causes, phenomena,
personali- ties, and effects he would have transformed his chronicle
into history.</p>
<p>Settling down in Florence in 1340, Boccaccio continued to pursue</p>
<p>woman in life and verse and prose. The Amorosa Visione was dedicated
to Fiammetta, and recalled in 4400 lines of terza rima the happier days
of their liaison. In a psychological novel, Fiammetta , the bastard
princess is made to tell the story of her deviation with Boccaccio; she
analyzes the emotions of love, the torments of desire and jealousy and
desertion, in Richardsonian detail; and when her conscience rebukes her
infidelity she imagines Aphrodite chiding her for cowardice: “Make not
thyself so timor - ous in saying, ‘I have a husband, and holy laws and
promised faith forbid me the se things.’ These are but vain conceits and
frivolous objections against the power of Eros. For like a strong and
mighty prince he plants his eternal laws; not caring for other laws of
lower state, he accounts them base and servile rules.”’ 7 Boccaccio,
abusing the power of the pen, ends the book by having Fiammetta
proclaim, to his glory, that it was he who deserted her, not she who
deserted him. Returning to poetry, he sang in the N inf ale Fiesolano
the love of a shepherd for a priestess of Diana; his triumph is
described in fond detail, with some enthusiasm spared for natural
scenery. This is almost the working formula of The Decameron.</p>
<p>It was shortly after the plague of 1 348 that Boccaccio began to
write this renowned concatenation of seductive tales. He was now
thirty-five; the temperature of desire had fallen from poetry to prose;
he could begin to see the humor of the mad pursuit. Fiammetta herself
seems to have died in the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>plague, and Boccaccio was calm enough to use the name that he had
given her for one of the least finicky raconteuses of his book. Though
the whole was not published till 1353, some of it must have been issued
in installments, for in the introduction to the Fourth Day the author
replies to the criticism that had reproved the earlier narratives. As we
have the book now it is a “century” of stories— a full hundred; they
were not meant to be read in any great number at one time; published
seriatim, they must have provided topics for many a Florentine
evening.</p>
<p>The prelude describes the effects, in Florence, of the Black Death
that struck all Europe in 1 348 and afterward. Born apparently of the
fertility and filth of Asiatic populations impoverished by war and
weakened by famine, the infection crossed Arabia into Egypt, and the
Black Sea into Russia and Byzantium. From Constantinople, Alexandria,
and other ports of the Near East the merchants and vessels of Venice,
Syracuse, Pisa, Genoa, and Marseille, aided by fleas and rats, brought
it to Italy and France. 38 A succession of famine years in western
Europe — 1 3 3 3-4, 1 337-42, 1 345-7 — probably sapped the resistance
of the poor, who then communi- cated the disease to all classes. 39 It
took two forms: pulmonary, with high fever and spitting of blood,
bringing death in three days; or bubonic, with fever, abscesses, and
carbuncles, leading to death in five days. Half the population of Italy
was carried off in the successive visitations of the plague from 1348 to
1365. 40 A Sienese chronicler wrote, about 1354:</p>
<p>Neither relatives nor friends nor priests nor friars accompanied</p>
<p>the corpses to the grave, nor was the office of the dead recited. . .
.</p>
<p>In many places of the city trenches were dug, very broad and
deep,</p>
<p>and into these the bodies were thrown, and covered with a little</p>
<p>earth; and thus layer after layer until the trench was full; and
then</p>
<p>another trench was begun. And I, Agniolo di Tura . . . with my
own</p>
<p>hands buried five of my children in a single trench; and many</p>
<p>others did the like. And many dead were so ill covered that the</p>
<p>dogs dug them up and ate them, dispersing their limbs throughout</p>
<p>the city. And no bells rang, and nobody wept no matter what his</p>
<p>loss, because almost everyone expected death. . . . And people
said</p>
<p>and believed, “This is the end of the world .” 41</p>
<p>In Florence, according to Matteo Villani, three out of five of the
population died between April and September of 1 348. Boccaccio
estimated the Flor- entine dead at 100,000, Machia velli at 96,000;“
these are transparent ex - aggerations, since the total population
hardly exceeded 100,000. Boccaccio opens The Decameron with a frightful
description of the plague:</p>
<p>3i</p>
<p>CHAP. I ) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO</p>
<p>Not only did converse and consorting with the sick give the</p>
<p>infection to the sound, but the mere touching of the clothes, or
of</p>
<p>whatsoever had been touched or used by the sick, appeared of itself
to communicate the malady. … A thing which had belonged to a</p>
<p>man sick or dead of the sickness, being touched by an animal . .
.</p>
<p>in a brief time killed it … of this mine own eyes had experience.</p>
<p>This tribulation struck such terror to the hearts of all . . .
that</p>
<p>brother forsook brother, uncle nephew . . . oftentimes wife husband;
nay (what is yet more extraordinary and well nigh incredible),</p>
<p>some fathers and mothers refused to visit or tend their very
children, as though they had not been theirs. . . . The common people,
being</p>
<p>altogether untended and unsuccored, sickened by the thousand</p>
<p>daily, and died well nigh without recourse. Many breathed their</p>
<p>last in the open street, whilst other many, for all they died in
their</p>
<p>houses, made it known to the neighbors that they were dead rather by
the stench of their rotting bodies than otherwise; and of these</p>
<p>and others who died the whole city was full. The neighbors,</p>
<p>moved more by fear lest the corruption of the dead bodies should</p>
<p>imperil themselves than by any charity for the departed . . . brought
the bodies forth from the houses and laid them before the doors,</p>
<p>where, especially in the morning, those who went about might see</p>
<p>corpses without number. Then they fetched biers, and some, in</p>
<p>default thereof, they laid upon a board; nor was it only one bier
that carried two or three corpses, nor did this happen but once;
nay,</p>
<p>many might have been counted which contained husband and wife, two or
three brothers, father and son, and the like. . . . The thing</p>
<p>was come to such a pass that folk reckoned no more of men that died
than nowadays they would of goats . 43</p>
<p>Out of this scene of desolation Boccaccio pictures his Decameron as
tak- ing form. The plan for the pagan outing is made in “the venerable
church of Santa Maria Novella” by “seven young ladies, all knit one to
another by friendship or neighborhood or kinship,” who had just heard
Mass. They ranged between eighteen and twenty- eight years of age. “Each
was dis - creet and of noble blood, fair of favor and well-mannered, and
full of honest sprightliness.” One pr oposes that they should lessen
their chances of infection by retiring to their country houses, not
separately but together, with their servants, moving from one villa to
another, “taking such pleas - ance and diversion as the season may
afford. . . . There may we hear the small birds sing, there may we see
the hills and plains clad in green and the fields full of corn wave even
as doth the sea; there may we see trees, a thousand sorts; and there is
the face of heaven more open to the view, the</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>which, angered against us though it be, denieth not unto us its
eternal beauties.” 44 The suggestion is accepted, but Filomena improves
upon it: since “we women are fickle, willful, suspicious, and timorous,”
it might be well to have some men in the party. Providentially at that
moment “there</p>
<p>So, on the Wednesday following, they set out, preceded by servants
and victuals, to a villa two m iles from Florence, “with a goodly and
great court - yard in its midst, and galleries and saloons and
bedchambers, each in itself most fair, and adorned with jocund
paintings; with lawns and grassplots round about, and wondrous-goodly
gardens, and wells of very cold water, and cellars full of wines of
price.” 45 The ladies and gentlemen sleep late, breakfast leisurely,
walk in the gardens, dine at length, and amuse them- selves by matching
stories. It is agreed that each of the ten shall tell a story on each
day of the outing. They stay in the country ten days (whence the title
of the book, from the Greek deka hemerai, ten days); and the result is
that Boccaccio’s commedia umana counters each of Dante’s gloomy cantos
with a merry tale. Meanwhile a rule forbids any member of the group to
“bring in from without any news other than joyous.”</p>
<p>The narratives, averaging six pages in length, were seldom original
with Boccaccio; they were collected from classical sources, Oriental
writers, medieval gesta, French contes and fabliaux, or the folklore of
Italy itself. The last and most famous story in the book is that of the
patient Griselda, which Chaucer adopted for one of the best and most
absurd of The Canter- bury T ales. The finest of Boccaccio’s no velle is
the ninth of the fifth day — of Federigo, his falcon, and his love,
almost as self- sacrificing as Griselda’s. The most philosophical is the
legend of the three rings (I, 3). Saladin, “Soldan of Babylon,” needing
money, invites the rich Jew Melch isedek to dinner, and asks him which
of the three religions is the best — the Jewish, the Christian, or the
Mohammedan. The wise old moneylender, fearing to speak his mind
directly, answers with a parable:</p>
<p>There was once a great man and a rich, who, among other very</p>
<p>precious jewels in his treasury, had a goodly and costly ring. . .
.</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 33</p>
<p>Wishing to leave it in perpetuity to his descendants, he declared</p>
<p>that whichever of his sons should, at his death, be found in
posses-</p>
<p>sion thereof, by his bequest unto him, should be recognized as
his</p>
<p>heir, and be held by all the others in honor and reverence as
chief</p>
<p>and head. He to whom the ring was left held a like course with
his</p>
<p>own descendants, and did even as his father had done. In brief,
the</p>
<p>ring passed from hand to hand, through many generations, and came at
last into the possession of a man who had three goodly and virtu- ous
sons all very obedient to their father, whereof he loved all three
alike. The young men knowing the usance of the ring, each desir-</p>
<p>ing to be the most honored among his folk . . . besought his
father,</p>
<p>who was now an old man, to leave him the ring. . . . The worthy</p>
<p>man, who knew not himself how to choose to which he had liefer</p>
<p>leave the ring, bethought himself … to satisfy all three, and
priv-</p>

<p>Such a story suggests that in his thirty-seventh year Boccaccio was
not a dogmatic Christian. Contrast his tolerance with the bitter bigotry
of Dante, who condemns Mohammed to perpetually repeated vivisections in
hell . 46 In the second story of The Decameron the Jew Jehannat is con-
verted to Christianity by the argument (adapted by Voltaire) that
Christi- anity must be divine, since it has survived so much clerical
immorality and simony. Boccaccio makes fun of asceticism, purity, the
confessional, relics, priests, monks, friars, nuns, even the
canonization of saints. He thinks most monks are hypocrites, and laughs
at the “simpletons” who give them alms (VI, io). One of his most
hilarious stories tells how the friar Cipolla, to raise a good
collection, promised his audience to display “a very holy relic, one of
the angel Gabriel’s feathers, which remained in the Virgin Mary’s cha
mber after the Annunciation” (VI, io). The most obscene of the</p>
<p>stories tells how the virile youth Masetto satisfied an entire
nunnery (III,</p>
<p>34 the renaissance (chap, i</p>
<p>i). In another tale Friar Rinaldo cuckolds a husband; whereupon the
nar- rator a sks, “What monks are there that do not do thus?” (VII,
3)</p>
<p>The ladies in The Decameron blush a bit at such stories, but enjoy
the Rabelaisian-Chaucerian humor; Filomena, a girl of especially nice
manners, tells the tale of Rinaldo; and sometimes, says B occaccio’s
least happy image, “the ladies kept up such a laughing that you might
have drawn all their teeth.” 47 Boccaccio had been reared in the loose
gaiety of Naples, and most often thought of love in sensual terms; he
smiled at chivalric romance, and played Sancho Panza to Dante’s Don
Quixote. Though twice married he seems to have believed in free love. 48
After recounting a score of stories that would today be unfit for a male
gathering, he makes one of the men say to the ladies: “I have noted n o
act, no word, in fine nothing blame- worthy, either on your part or on
that of us men.” In concluding his book the author acknowledges some
criticism of the license he has used, and especially because “I have in
sundry places written the truth about t he friars.” At the same time he
congratulates himself on his “long labor, thor - oughly accomplished
with the aid of the Divine favor.”</p>
<p>The Decameron remains one of the masterpieces of world literature.
Its fame may be due more to its morals than to its art, but even if
immaculate it would have merited preservation. It is perfectly
constructed — superior in this respect to The Canterbury Tales. Its
prose set a standard that Italian literature has never surpassed, a
prose sometimes involved or flowery, but for the most part eloquent and
vigorous, pungent and vivacious, and clear as a mountain stream. It is a
book of the love of life. In the greatest disaster that had befallen
Italy in a thousand years Boccaccio could find in his vitals the courage
to see beauty, humor, goodness, and joy still walking the earth. At
times he was cynical, as in his unmanly satire on women in the Corbac-
cio; but in The Decameron he was a hearty Rabelais, relishing the give
and take, the rough and tumble, of life and love. Despite caricature and
exag- geration the world recognized itself in the book; every European
language translated it; Hans Sachs and Lessing, Moliere and La Fontaine,
Chaucer and Shakespeare, took leaves from it admiringly. It will be
enjoyed when all of Petrarch’s poetry has entered the twilight realm of
the praised unread.</p>

<li>SIENA</li>
</ol>
<p>Siena would have challenged the claim of Florence to have begotten
the Renaissance. There too the violence of faction raised the
temperature of thought, and communal pride nourished art. The woolen
industry, the</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 35</p>
<p>export of Sienese products to the Levant, and the trade of the Via
Flaminia between Florence and Rome gave the city a moderate affluence;
by 1400 the squares and principal streets were paved with brick or
stone; and the poor were rich enough to stage a revolution. In 1371 the
woolworkers besieged the Palazzo Pubblico, broke down its doors,
expelled the business- men’s government, and set up the ru le of the
riformatori. A few days later an army of two thousand men, fully
equipped by the mercantile interests, made its way into the city,
invaded the quarters of the proletariat, and slew men, women, and
children without discrimination or mercy, spitting some on the lance,
hacking others with the sword. The nobility and the lower middle class
came to the rescue of the commons, the counterrevolution was defeated,
and the reform government gave Siena the most honest adminis- tration
that the citizens could recall. In 1385 the rich merchants rose again,
overthrew the riformatori, and expelled four thousand rebel workmen from
the city. From that date industry and art declined in Siena.*</p>
<p>It was in this turbulent fourteenth century that Siena reached the
zenith of her art. On the west side of the spacious Campo — the main
square of the city — rose the Palazzo Pubblico (1288-1309); the
adjoining campanile, the Torre de Mangia, rearing its slender height to
3 34 feet, is the most beautiful tower in Italy. In 1310 the Sienese
architect and sculptor Lorenzo Maitani went to Orvieto and designed the
lordly facade of the cathedral there; he and other Sienese artists, and
Andrea Pisano, engaged in a frenzy of decora- tion on the portals,
pilasters, and pediments, and produced a miracle in marble to
commemorate the miracle of Bolsena. In 1377 the great duomo of Siena
received a similar facade from designs left by Giovanni Pisano, perhaps
too ornate, but still one of the wonders of inexhaustible Italy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a brilliant band of Sienese painters had carried on where
Duccio di Buoninsegna had left off. In 1315 Simone Martini was commis-
sioned to decorate the Hall of the Great Council in the Palazzo Pubblico
with a maestd, i.e., a Coronation of the Virgin; for Mary was, in law as
well as in theology, the crowned queen of the city, and might properly
preside at meetings of the municipal government. The picture dared
comparison with the maestd that Duccio had painted for the cathedral
five years before; it was not so large, nor so overlaid with gold; like
that “majesty” it betrayed</p>

<p>lifeless pose of its crowded characters; perhaps it made some advance
in color and design. But in 1326 Simone went to Assisi; there he studied
the frescoes of Giotto; and when he was invited to picture in a chapel
of the Lower Church the life of St. Martin he escaped from the
stereotyped faces of his earlier work, and achieved a memorable
individualization of the great Bishop of Tours. At Avignon he met
Petrarch, painted portraits of the poet and Laura, and won an
appreciative mention in the Canzoniere. These brief lines, said Vasari,
“have given more fame to Simone than all his own works have done … for a
day will come when his paintings will be no more, whereas the writings
of su ch a man as Petrarch endure for all time”; no geologist would be
so optimistic. Benedict XII made Simone official painter to the papal
court (1339); and in that capacity he illustrated the life of the
Baptist in the papal chapel, and of the Virgin and the Saviour in the
portico of the cathedral. He died at Avignon in 1 344.</p>
<p>That secularization of art which Simone had essayed in his lay
portraits was extended by Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Perhaps after
studying in Florence, Pietro abandoned the sentimental traditions of
Sienese painting, and produced a series of altar pictures of
unprecedented power, sometimes of savage realism. In the Hall of the
Nine (Councilors) in the Palazzo</p>
<p>Pubblico Ambrogio painted four famous frescoes (1337-43): Evil Gov-
ermnent, The Consequences of Evil Government , Good Government , and The
Consequences of Good Government. Here the medieval habit of symbolism,
superseded by Giotto, is retained; majestic figures represent Siena,
Justice, Wisdom, Concord, the Seven Virtues, and Peace — the last
reclining gracefully like a Pheidian deity. In Evil Government Tyranny
is enthroned, and Terror is his vizier; merchants are plundered on the
road; faction and violence incarnadine the town. Against the same
architectural background Good Government shows a population happily busy
with handicrafts, amusements, and trade; farmers and merchants lead into
the city mules laden with food and goods; children play, maidens dance,
viols make silent music; and over the scene a winged spirit flies,
figuring Security. Perhaps it was these energetic brothers — or Orcagna,
or Francesco Traini — who painted the immense fresco, The Triumph of
Death, in the Campo Santo at Pisa. A hunting party of lords and ladies
richly attired comes upon three open coffins in which royal corpses lie
festering; one hunter holds his nose at their smell; above the scene
hovers the Angel of Death, wielding an enormous scythe; in the air
ministers of grace escort saved souls to paradise, while winged demons
drag most of the dead into hell; serpents and black vultures entwine and
consume the naked bodies of women and men; and</p>

<p>below, kings, queens, princes, bishops, cardinals writhe in the pit
of the damned. On a neighboring wall the same authors, in another

second vision of hell. All the terrors of medieval theology here take
physical form; it is Dante’s Inferno visualized with out mercy and

<p>Siena never emerged from the Middle Ages; there, as in Gubbio, San
Gimignano, and Sicily, they survived the Renaissance. They never die,
but patiently, subtly bide their time to come again.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>MILAN</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1351 Petrarch returned to Avignon. Probably at Vaucluse he wrote a
pretty essay, De vita solitaria, lauding the solitude that he could bear
as a healing medicine but not as a sustaining food. It was shortly after
this re- turn to Avignon that he brought the medical fraternity down
upon his head by exhorting Pope Clement VI, who was in failing health,
to beware of doctors’ prescriptions. “I have always begged my friends,
and ordered my servants, never to let any of these doctors’ tricks to be
tried on my body, but al ways to do the exact contrary of what they
advise.” 49 In 1355, exasperated by some therapeutic fiasco, he composed
an intemperate Invec- tive Against a Physician. He was not much better
disposed toward lawyers, “who spend their entire time in disputati ons
…. over trival questions. Hear my verdict upon the whole pack of them.
Their fame will die with their flesh, and a single grave will suffice
for their names and their bones.” 50 To make Avignon completely
distasteful to him Pope Innocent VI pro- posed to excommunicate Petrarch
as a necromancer, on the ground that the poet was a student of Virgil.
Cardinal Talleyrand came to Petrarch’s res - cue, but the air of saintly
ignorance that now perfumed Avignon sickened the laureate. He visited
his monk brother Gherardo, wrote a wistful trea- tise De otio
reliogiosorum {On the Leisure of Monks), and toyed with the idea of
entering a monastery. But when an invitation came to him to be the
palace guest of the dictator of Milan (1353), he accepted with a
readiness that shocked his republican friends.</p>
<p>The ruling family in Milan bore the name Visconti from having often
filled the post of vicecomites , or archiepiscopal judges. In 131 1 the
Em- peror Henry VII appointed Matteo Visconti his vicar in Milan, which,
like most cities in northern Italy, loosely acknowledged itself as part
of the Holy Roman Empire. Though Matteo made serious blunders he
governed so ably that his descendants held power in Milan till 1447.
They were</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>seldom scrupulous, often cruel, sometimes extravagant, never stupid.
They taxed the people heavily for the numerous campaigns that brought
most of northwestern Italy under their rule, but their skill in finding
competent ad- ministrators and generals brought victory to their arms
and prosperity to Milan. To the woolen manufactures of the city they
added a silk industry; they multiplied the canals that extended the
city’s trade; they gave to life and property a security that made their
subjects forgetful of liberty. Un- der their tyranny Milan became one of
the richest cities of Europe; its pal- aces, faced with marble, lined
avenues paved with stone. With Giovanni Visconti, handsome,
indefatigable, ruthless or generous at need or whim, Milan reached its
zenith; Lodi, Parma, Crema, Piacenza, Brescia, Bergamo, Novara, Como,
Vercelli, Alessandria, Tortona, Pontremoli, Asti, Bologna acknowledged
his rule; and when the Avignon popes contested his claim to Bologna, and
visited him with excommunication, he fought Clement VI with courage and
bribery, and with 200,000 florins won Bologna, absolu- tion, and peace
(1352). He paid for his crimes with gout, and adorned his despotism with
the patronage of poetry, learning, and art. When Petrarch, arriving at
his court, asked what duties would be expected of him, Giovanni replied
handsomely: “Only your presence, which will grace both myself and my
reign.” 51</p>
<p>Petrarch remained eight years at the Visconti court in Pavia or
Milan. During this comfortable subjection he composed in Italian terza
rima a series of poems that he called Trionfi: the triumph of desire
over man, of chastity over desire, of death over chastity, of fame over
death, of time over fame, of eternity over time. Here he sang his final
word of Laura; he asked pardon for the sensuality of his love, conversed
with her chaste ghost, and dreamed of being united with her in paradise
— her husband having appar- ently gone elsewhere. These poems,
challenging comparison with Dante, represent the triumph of vanity over
art.</p>
<p>Giovanni Visconti, dying in 1 3 54, bequeathed his state to three
nephews. Matteo II was a sensual incompetent, and was fraternally
assassinated for the honor of the house (1355). Bernabo governed part of
the duchy from Milan, Galeazzo II the remainder from Pavia. Galeazzo II
was a capable ruler who wore his golden hair in curls and wedded his
children to royalty. When his daughter Violante married the Duke of
Clarence, son of King Edward III of England, Galeazzo dowered the bride
with 200,000 gold florins (,000,000), and gave the two hundred English
attendants of the groom such presents as outshone the generosity of the
wealthiest contempo- rary kings; the leavings of the wedding banquet, we
are assured, could have</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 39</p>
<p>fed ten thousand men. So rich was trecento Italy, at a time when
England was bankrupting herself, and France was bleeding herself white,
in the Hundred Years’ War.</p>
<p>X. VENICE AND GENOA</p>
<p>In 1354 Duke Giovanni Visconti sent Petrarch to Venice to negotiate
peace between Venice and Genoa.</p>
<p>“You see in Genoa,” the poet had written, “a city in the act of
ruling, seated on rough hillsides, superb in walls and men.” 52 The
merchant’s itch f or gain, pitting the sailor’s pluck against the sea,
had plowed lanes of Genoese commerce through the Mediterranean to Tunis,
Rhodes, Acre, and Tyre, to Samos, Lesbos, and Constantinople, through
the Black Sea to the Crimea and Trebizond, through Gibraltar and the
Atlantic to Rouen and Bruges. These enterprising businessmen developed
double-entry book- keeping by 1340, and marine insurance by 1370; 53
they borrowed money from private investors at seven to ten per cent,
while in most Italian cities the rate ranged from twelve to thirty. For
a long time the fruits of trade were divided, never amicably, among a
few rich families — the Doria, the Spinola, the Grimaldi, the Fieschi.
In 1 339 Simone Boccanera led the sailors and other workers in a
successful revolution, and became the first of a line of doges that
ruled Genoa till 1797; Verdi commemorated him in an opera. The victors
in their turn divided into hostile family groups, and disordered the
city with costly strife, while Genoa’s great rival, Venice, thrived on
order and unity.</p>
<p>Next to Milan, Venice was the richest and strongest state in Italy,
and without exception the most ably governed. Its craftsmen were famous
for the elegance of their products, mostly made for the luxury trade.
Its great arsenal employed 16,000 men; 36,000 seamen manned its 3300
vessels of war or trade; and in the galleys freemen, not slaves as in
the sixteenth century, plied the oars. Venetian merchants invaded every
market from Jerusalem to Antwerp; they traded impartially with
Christians and Mo- hammedans, and papal excommunications fell upon them
with all the force of dew upon the earth. Petrarch, who had ranged from
Naples to Flanders in his “love and zeal for seeing many things,”
marveled at the shipping h e saw in the Venetian lagoons:</p>
<p>I see vessels … as big as my mansion, their masts taller than its</p>
<p>towers. They are as mountains floating on the waters. They go to</p>
<p>face incalculable dangers in every portion of the globe. They
bear</p>
<p>4 °</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>wine to England, honey to Russia, saffron, oil, and linen to
Assyria,</p>
<p>Armenia, Persia, and Araby, wood to Egypt and Greece. They</p>
<p>return heavily laden with products of all kinds, which are sent hence
to every part of the world. 54</p>
<p>This lusty trade was financed by private funds collected and invested
by moneylenders who began in the fourteenth century to take the name of
bankers, bancherii , from the banco or bench on which they sat before
their tables of exchange. The chief monetary units were the lira (a
shortening of libra, pound) and the ducat (from duca , duke, doge), a
gold coin of 3560 grams. This and the Florentine florin were the most
stable and most widely honored currencies in Christendom.*</p>
<p>Life here was almost as g ay as in the Naples of Boccaccio’s youth.
The Venetians celebrated their holidays and victories with majestic
ceremonies, carved and colored their pleasure vessels and their men- o’
-war, draped their flesh in Oriental silks, brightened their tables with
Venetian glass, and made much music on their waters and in their homes.
In 1365 the Doge Lorenzo Celsi, accompanied by Petrarch, presided over a
competition among the best musicians in Italy; poems were chanted to
various accompaniments, great choruses sang, and the first prize was
awarded to Francesco Landino of Florence, a blind composer of ballads
and madrigals. Lorenzo Veneziano and others were making the transition
from medieval severity to Renais- sance grace in frescoes and polyptychs
already presaging the colorfulness of Venetian painting. Houses,
palaces, and churches rose like corals out of the sea. There were no
castles in Venice, no fortified dwellings, no massive forbidding walls,
for here private feud soon submitted to public law, and, besides, almost
every mansion had a natural moat. Architectural design was still Gothic,
but light and graceful as northern Gothic dared not be. In this period
the majestic church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari was built;
St. Mark’s continued, eve ry now and then, to lift its aging face with
youthful decorations of sculpture, mosaic, and arabesques, and
superimposed Gothic ogives upon some round arches of the old Byzantine
form. Though the Piazza San Marco had not yet received its full
encirclement of architecture, Petrarch doubted “if it has an equal
within the bounds of the world.” 55</p>

this monolithic structure of economy and government, ruling an Adriatic
and Aegean empire from an Archimedean fragment of the earth, met a

<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 41</p>
<p>challenge in 1 378, when the old strife with Genoa reached its peak.
Luciano Doria led a Genoese armada up to Pola, found the main Venetian
fleet weakened by an epidemic among the sailors, and in an overwhelming
vic- tory captured fifteen galleys and nearly two thousand men. Luciano
lost his life in the battle, but his brother Ambrogio, succeeding him as
admiral, took the town of Chioggia — on a narrow promontory some fifteen
miles south of Venice — formed an alliance with Padua, blocked all
Venetian ship- ping, and prepared, with Genoese seamen and Paduan
mercenaries, to in- vade Venice itself. The proud city, apparently
defenseless, asked for terms; these were so insolent and severe that the
Great Council resolved to fight for every foot of water in the lagoons.
The rich poured their hidden wealth into the coffers of the state; the
people labored day and night to build an- other fleet; floating
fortresses were raised around the islands, and were equipped with
cannon, now for the first time appearing in Italy (1379). But the
Genoese and Paduans, having already blockaded Venice from the sea,
stretched a cordon of troops across its land approaches, and shut off
the city’s food supply. While some of the population starved, Vittore
Pisani trained recruits for the new navy. In December, 1379, Pisani and
the Doge Andrea Contarini led the reconstituted fleet — thirty-four
galleys, sixty large craft, four hundred small boats — to besiege the
Genoese and their ships at Chioggia. The Genoese fleet was too small to
face the new Venetian navy; Venetian cannon shot into, the Genoese
vessels, fortresses, and barracks stones weighing 150 pounds, killing,
among many, the Genoese admiral Pietro Doria. The Genoese, starving,
asked leave to evacuate the women and children from Chioggia; the
Venetians consented; but when the Geno- ese offered to yield if their
fleet should be allowed to depart, it was the turn of Venice to demand
unconditional surrender. For six months the siege of Chioggia continued;
at last, reduced by disease and death, the Genoese gave up; and Venice
treated them humanely. When Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, offered
mediation the exhausted rivals agreed; they made mutual concessions,
exchanged prisoners, and resigned themselves to peace (1381).</p>

<p>Petrarch, sampling every city and every host, took up his residence
in Venice in 1361, and lived there for seven years. He brought his
library with him, containing almost all the Latin classics except
Lucretius. In an eloquent letter he deeded the precious collection to
Venice, but reserved its use to himself till his death. As a gesture of
appreciation the Venetian gov-</p>

<p>ernment assigned to him the Palazzo Molina, furnished for his
comfort. However, Petrarch took his books with him on his later
wanderings; at his death they fell into the hands of his last host,
Francesco I da Carrara, an enemy of Venice; some were kept at Padua,
most were sold or otherwise dispersed.</p>
<p>It was probably at Venice that he wrote an essay De officio et
virtutibus imperatoris (On the Duty and Virtues of an Emperor ), and a
long concate- nation of dialogues De remediis utriusque fortunae
(Remedies for Both 〔Good and Bad〕 Fortune). He counsels modesty in
prosperity and cour- age in adversity; warns against hitching one’s
happi ness to earthly victories or goods; teaches how to bear with
toothache, obesity, the loss of a wife, the fluctuations of fame. It is
all good advice, but it is all in Seneca. About this time, too, he
composed his greatest prose work, De viris illustribus, thirty-one
biographies of Roman celebrities from Romulus to Caesar; the 350 octavo
pages devoted to Caesar constituted the most thorough life of that
statesman till the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Petrarch left Venice in 1 368 for Pavia, hoping to negotiate a peace
there between Galeazzo II Visconti and Pope Urban V, only to learn that
elo- quence without guns finds no ears among diplomats. In 1370 he
accepted the invitation of Francesco I da Carrara to live for the second
time as a royal guest in Padua . But his aging nerves resented the
city’s bustle, and he soon retired to a modest villa at Arqua, in the
Euganean hills, twelve miles southwest of Padua. There he passed the
remaining four years of his life. He gathered and edited his letters for
posthumous publication, and wrote a charming miniature autobiography,
Epistola ad poster os (1371). Again he yielded to the philosopher’s
ancient failing— to tell statesmen how to man- age states. In De
republic a optime administranda (1372) he advised the lord of Padua to
“be not the master but the father of thy subjects, and to love them as
thy children”; to drain marshes, ensure a food supply, maintain
churches, support the sick and helpless, and give protection and
patronage to men of letters — on whose pens all fame depends. Then he
took up The Decameron, and translated the story of Griselda into Latin
to win for it a European audience.</p>
<p>Boccaccio was now in a mood to regret that he had ever written The
Decameron or the sensual poems of his youth. In 1361 a dying monk had
sent him a message reproaching him with his evil life and merry tales,
and prophesying for him, in case he deferred reform, a speedy death and
ever- lasting agonies in hell. Boccaccio had never been an assiduous
thinker; he accepted the delusions of his time in regard to casting
horoscopes and tell-</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 43</p>
<p>ing the future through dreams; he believed in a multitude of demons,
and thought that Aeneas had veritably visited Hades. 50 He turned now to
orthodoxy, and thought of selling his books and becoming a monk. Pe-
trarch, advised of this, besought him to take a middle course: to turn
from the writing of amorous Italian poems and novelle to the earnest
study of the Latin and Greek c lassics. Boccaccio accepted the counsel
of his “venerable master,” and became the first Greek humanist in
Western Europe.</p>
<p>Urged on by Petrarch, he collected classical manuscripts; rescued
books JXI-XVI of the Annals, and books I-V of the Histories, of Tacitus
from their oblivion in the neglected library of Monte Cassino; restored
the texts of Martial and Ausonius, and contrived to give Homer to the
Western world. Some scholars in the Age of Faith had carried on a
knowledge of Greek, but in Boccaccio ’s day Greek had almost totally
disappeared from the ken of the West except in half -Greek Southern
Italy. In 1 342 Petrarch began to study Greek with the Calabrian monk
Barlaam. When a bishopric in Calabria fell vacant Petrarch successfully
recommended Barlaam for it; the monk departed, and Petrarch dropped
Greek for lack of a teacher, a grammar, or a lexicon; no such books were
then available in Latin or Italian. In 1359 Boccaccio met at Milan one
of Barlaam’s pupils, Leon Pilatus. He invited him to Florence, and
persuaded the university — which had been founded eleven years before —
to establish a chair of Greek for Pilatus. Pe- trarch helped to pay his
salary, sent copies of the Iliad and the Odyssey to Boccaccio, and
commissioned Pilatus to translate them into Latin. The work was
frequently delayed, and involved Petrarch in a troublesome cor-
respondence; he complained that the letters of Pilatus were even longer
and dirtier than his ’beard; 57 only through Boccaccio’s exhortations
and co - operation was Pilatus prodded to complete the task. This
inaccurate and prosaic version was the only Latin translation of Homer
known to Europe in the fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pilatus had taught Boccaccio enough Greek to read the</p>
<p>Greek classics haltingly. Boccaccio confessed that he understood the
texts only partly, but described what he did understand as surpassingly
beautiful. Inspired by these books and Petrarch, he devoted almost all
his remaining literary work to the purpose of promoting in Latin Europe
a knowledge of Greek literature, mythology, and history. In a series of
brief biographies De casibus virorum illustrium ( On the Vicissitudes of
Famous Men) he ranged from Adam to King John of France; in De Claris
mulieribus he told the stories of famous women from Eve to Queen Joanna
I of Naples; in De montibus, silvis, fontibus, etc., he described in

<p>tains, forests, springs, rivers, and lakes named in Greek literature;
and in De genealogiis deorum he composed a handbook of classical
mythology. So deeply did he become absorbed in his subject that he spoke
of the Chris- tian God as Jove, of Satan as Pluto, of Venus and Mars as
if they were as real as Mary and Christ. These books seem now
intolerably dull, written in bad Latin and with middling scholarship;
but in their time they were pre- cious manuals for students of Greece,
and played an important role in im- plementing the Renaissance.</p>
<p>So Boccaccio moved from the escapades of youth to the dignity of old
age. Florence used him now and then as a diplomat, sending him on mis-
sions to Forli, Avignon, Ravenna, and Venice. At sixty he was physically
weak, suffering from dry scab and “more maladies than I know how to
enumerate.” 58 He lived in suburban Certaldo in bitter poverty. Perhaps
it was to aid him financially that some friends in 1373 persuaded the
Floren- tine Signory to create a cathedra Dantesca, or chair of Dante,
and to pay Boccaccio a hundred florins (500) to give a course of
lectures on Dante in the Badia. His health broke down before the course
was complete, and he turned to Certaldo reconciled to death.</p>
<p>Petrarch had written, “I desire that death find me ready and writing,
or, if it please Christ, praying and in tears.” 59 On his seventieth
birthday, July 20, 1374, he was found leaning over a book, apparently
sleeping, actually dead. In his will he left fifty florins to buy a
mantle for Boccaccio as pro- tection against the cold during the long
winter nights. On December 2 1 , 1 375, Boccaccio too died, aged
sixty-one. For fifty years now Italy would lie fallow, till the seeds
that these men had planted would come to flower.</p>

<p>We have followed Petrarch and Boccaccio through Italy. But
politically there was no Italy; there were only city-states, fragments
free to consume themselves in hate and war. Pisa destroyed its
commercial rival Amalfi; Milan destroyed Piacenza; Genoa and Florence
destroyed Pisa; Venice destroyed Genoa; and half of Europe would join
most of Italy to destroy Venice. The collapse of central government in
the barbarian invasions, the “Gothic War” of the sixth century, the
Lombard -Byzantine dichotomy of the peninsula, the decay of the Roman
roads, the contest of Lombards and popes, the conflict of papacy and
Empire, the papal fear that one secular power sovereign from the Alps to
Sicily would make the pope a prisoner, subjecting the spiritual head of
Europe to the political leader of a state: all</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 45</p>
<p>these had wrought the disunity of Italy. Partisans of the popes and
parti- sans of the emperors not only divided Italy, they split almost
every city into Guelf and Ghibelline; and even when that strife subsided
the old labels were used by new rivalries, and the lava of hate flowed
into all the avenues of life. If Ghibellines wore feathers on one side
of their caps, Guelfs wore them on the other; if Ghibellines cut fruit
crosswise, Guelfs cut it straight down; if Ghibellines wore white roses,
Guelfs wore red. In Crema the Ghibellines of Milan tore a statue of
Christ from a church altar and burned it becaused its face was turned in
what was considered a Guelf direction; in Ghibelline Bergamo some
Calabrians were murdered by their hosts, who discovered from their way
of eating garlic that they were Guelfs . 00 The timid weakness of
individuals, the insecurity of groups, and the delusion of superiority
generated perpetual fear, suspicion, dislike, and contempt of the
different, the alien, and the strange.</p>
<p>Out of these impediments to unity rose the Italian city-state.
Men</p>
<p>thought in terms of their city, and only a few philosophers like
Machiavelli, or a poet like Petrarch, could think of Italy as a whole;
even in the sixteenth century Cellini would refer to Florentines as “men
of our nation,” and to Florence as “my fatherland.” Petrarch, freed by
foreign residence from a merely local patriotism, mourned the petty wars
and divisions of his native country, and in an eloquent ode — Italia Mia
! — besought the princes of Italy to give her unity and peace.</p>
<p>O my own Italy! — though words are vain</p>
<p>The mortal wounds to close</p>
<p>Innumerable that thy bosom stain —</p>
<p>Yet may it soothe my pain</p>
<p>To sing of Tiber’s woes</p>
<p>And Arno’s wrongs, as on Po’s saddened shore</p>
<p>Mournful I wander, and my numbers pour. . . .</p>
<p>Oh, is this not the soil my foot first pressed?</p>
<p>And here, in cradled rest</p>
<p>Was I not softly hushed and fondly reared?</p>
<p>Oh, is not this my country — so endeared</p>
<p>By every filial tie-</p>
<p>in whose earth shrouded both my parents lie?</p>
<p>Oh, by this tender thought</p>
<p>Your hard hearts to some pity wrought,</p>
<p>Look on the people’s grief,</p>
<p>Who, under God, of you expect relief,</p>
<p>4 6</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>And, if ye but relent,</p>
<p>Virtue shall rouse her in embattled might,</p>
<p>Against blind fury bent,</p>
<p>Nor long shall doubtful hang the unequal fight.</p>
<p>No, no! The ancient flame</p>
<p>Is not extinguished yet, that raised the Italian name!</p>
<p>Petrarch had dreamed that Rienzo might make Italy one; when that
bubble burst he turned like Dante to the head of the Holy Roman Empire,
theoretically the secular heir to all the temporal powers of the pagan
Roman Empire in the West. Soon after Rienzo’s retirement ( 1347)
Petrarch ad- dressed a stirring message to Charles IV, King of Bohemia
and, as “King of the Romans,” heir apparent to the Imperial throne. Let
the King come down to Rome and be crowned emperor, the poet pleaded; let
him make Rome, not Prague, his capital; let him restore unity, order,
and peace to “the garden of the Empire”— Italy. 61 When Charles crossed
the Alps in 1 3 54 he invited Petrarch to meet him at Mantua, and
listened courteously to appeals echoing the impassioned pleas of Dante
to C harles’s grandfather Henry VII. But Charles, having no force
adequate to conquer all the</p>
<p>despots of Lombardy and all the citizens of Florence and Venice,
hurried to Rome, got himself crowned by a papal prefect for lack of a
pope, and then hastened back to Bohemia, sedulously selling Imperial
vicariates on the way. Two years later Petrarch went to him in Prague as
Milanese ambassador, but with no significant results for Italy.</p>
<p>Perhaps there would have been no Renaissance if Petrarch had had his
way. The fragmentation of Italy favored the Renaissance. Large states
promote order and power rather than liberty or art. The commercial
rivalry of the Italian cities inaugurated and completed the work of the
Crusades in developing the economy and wealth of Italy. The variety of
political centers multiplied interurban strife, but these modest
conflicts never totaled the death and destruction caused in France by
the Hundred Years’ War. Local independence weakened the capacity of
Italy to defend herself against foreign invasion, but it generated a
noble rivalry of the cities and princes in cultural patronage, in the
zeal to excel in architecture, sculp- ture, painting, education,
scholarship, poetry. Renaissance Italy, like Goethe’s Germany, had many
Par ises.</p>
<p>We need not exaggerate, to appreciate, the degree in which Petrarch
and Boccaccio prepared the Renaissance. Both were still mortgaged to
medieval ideas. The great storyteller, in his lusty youth, laughed at
clerical im- morality and relicmongering, but so had millions of
medieval men and</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE AGE OF PETRARCH AND BOCCACCIO 47</p>
<p>women; and he became more orthodox and medieval in those very years
in which he studied Greek. Petrarch properly and prophetically described
himself as standing between two eras . 62 He accepted the dogmas of the
Church even while he flayed the morals of Avignon; he loved the classics
with a troubled conscience at the close of the Age of Faith as Jerome
had loved them at its opening; he wrote excellent medieval essays on
contempt of the secular world and on the holy peace of the religious
life. Nevertheless, he was more faithful to the classics than to Laura;
he sought and cherished ancient manuscripts, and inspired others to do
the same; he overleaped nearly all medieval authors except Augustine to
regain continuity with Latin literature; he formed his manner and style
on Virgil and Cicero; and he thought more of the fame of his name than
of the immortality of his soul. His poems fostered a century of
artificial sonneteering in Italy, but they helped to mold the sonnets of
Shakespeare. His eager spirit passed down to Pico, his polished form to
Politian; his letters and essays threw a bridge of classical urbanity
and grace between Seneca and Montaigne; his recon- ciliation of
antiquity and Christianity matured in Popes Nicholas V and Leo X. He was
truly, in these ways, the Father of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>But again it would be an error to overrate the contributions of
antiquity to this Italian apogee. It was a fullfillment rather than a
revolution, and the medieval maturation played a far greater role than
the recovery of classic manuscripts and art. Many medieval scholars had
known and loved the pagan classics; it was the monks who had preserved
them; it was clerics who in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had
translated or edited them. The great universities had since i ioo passed
down to the youth of Europe some measure of the mental and moral
heritage of the race. The growth of a critical philosophy in Erigena and
Abelard, the introduction of Aristotle and Averroes into university
curriculums, the brave proposal of Aquinas to prove nearly all Christian
dogmas by reason, so soon followed by Duns Scotus’ confession that most
of these doctrin es were beyond reason, had reared and shattered the
intellectual edifice of Scholasticism, and had left the educated
Christian free to attempt a new synthesis of pagan philosophy and
medieval theology with the experience of life. The liberation of the
towns from feudal hindrances, the widening of commerce, the spread of a
money economy — all these had preceded Petrarch’s birth. Roger of Sicily
and Frederick II, not to speak of Moslem caliphs and sultans, had taught
rulers to give glamour to power by patronizing art and poetry, science
and philosophy. Medieval men and women, despite an otherworldly
minority, had kept, unabashed, the natural human relish for the simple
and sensual</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>pleasures of life. The men who conceived, built, and carved the
cathedrals had their own sense of beauty, and a sublimity of thought and
form never surpassed.</p>
<p>Therefore all the bases of the Renaissance had been established by
the time of Petrarch’s death. The amazing growth and zes t of Italian
trade and industry had gathered the wealth that financed the movement,
and the passage from rural peace and stagnation to urban vitality and
stimulus had begotten the mood that nourished it. The political basis
had been prepared in the freedom and rivalry of the cities, in the
overthrow of an idle aris- tocracy, in the rise of educated princes and
a virile bourgeoisie. The lit- erary basis had been prepared in the
improvement of the vernacular lan- guages, and in the zeal for
recovering and studying the classics of Greece and Rome. The ethical
bases had been laid: increasing wealth was breaking down old moral
restraints; contact with Islam in commerce and Crusades had encouraged a
new tolerance for doctrinal and moral deviations from traditional
beliefs and ways; the rediscovery of a pagan world relatively free in
thought and conduct shared in undermining medieval dogmas and morality;
interest in a future life gave ground before secular, human, earthly
concerns. Esthetic development proceeded; the medieval hymns, the cycles
of romance, the songs of the troubadours, the sonnets of Dante and his
Italian predecessors, the sculptured harmony and form of The Di- vine
Comedy, had left a heritage of literary art; the classic models trans -
mitted a refinement of taste and thought, a polish and politeness of
speech and style, to Petrarch, who would bequeath it to an international
dynasty of urbane genius from Erasmus to Anatole France. And a
revolution in art had begun when Giotto abandoned the mystic rigor of
Byzantine mosaics to study men and women in the actual flow and natural
grace of their lives</p>
<p>In Italy all roads were leading to the Renaissance.</p>
