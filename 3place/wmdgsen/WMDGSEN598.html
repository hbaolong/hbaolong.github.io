<h4 id="chapter-iii-the-legislative-assembly">CHAPTER III The
Legislative Assembly</h4>
<p>October i, 1791 — September 20, 1792</p>
<p>I. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA</p>
<p>T ’HE elections for the second revolutionary congress were zealously
monitored by the journalists and powerfully supervised by the clubs.
Since censorship of the press had almost disappeared, the journalists
had acquired new influence on public policy. Brissot, Loustalot, Marat,
Des- moulins, Freron, Laclos — each had a periodical for his tribune.
Paris alone had 133 journals in 1790, and there were hundreds in the
provinces. Nearly all of them followed a radical line. Mirabeau had told
the King that if he wished to keep his throne or his head he must buy
some popular journalists. “The old nobility,” said Napoleon, “would have
survived if it had known enough to become master of printing materials….
The advent of cannon killed the feudal system; ink will kill the modem
system.” 1</p>
<p>The clubs were almost as effective as the journals. The Breton Club,
hav- ing followed King and Assembly to Paris, renamed itself Society of
the Friends of the Constitution, and leased as a meeting place the
refectory of a former Jacobin monastery near the Tuileries; later it
expanded into the library, and even the chapel. 2 The Jacobins, as
history came to call them, were at first all deputies, but they soon
enriched their membership by ad- mitting persons prominent in science,
literature, politics, or business; here former deputies like
Robespierre, self-debarred from the new Assembly, found another fulcrum
of power. Dues were high, and until 1793 most of the members came from
the middle class. 3</p>
<p>The Jacobin influence was multiplied by the organization of
affiliated clubs in many of the communes of France, and their general
acceptance of the parent club’s lead in doctrine and strategy. There
were some 6,800 Jacobin clubs in 1794, totaling half a million members.
4 They formed an or- ganized minority in a disorganized mass. When their
policies were supported by the journals their influence was second only
to that of the communes — which, through their municipal councils and
constituent sections, controlled the local regiments of the National
Guard. When all these forces were in harmony the Assembly had to do
their bidding or face an unruly gallery, if not armed insurrection.</p>
<p>An Englishman in Paris in 1791 reported that “clubs abound in every
street.” 6 There were literary societies, sporting associations, Freem
ason lodges, workmen’s gatherings. Finding the Jacobins too expensive
and bour -</p>

<p>34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>geois, some radical leaders formed in 1790 the “Society of the
Friends of Man and the Gtizen,” which the Parisians soon called the
Cordeliers Club, because it met in the former monastery of the Cordelier
(Franciscan) friars; this gave a platform to Marat, Hebert, Desmoulins,
and Danton. Finding the Jacobins too radical, Lafayette, Bailly,
Talleyrand, Lavoisier, Andre and Marie- Joseph de Chenier, and Du Pont
de Nemours formed the “Society of 1789,” which began, in 1790, regular
meetings in the Palais -Royal, to sup- port the tottering monarchy.
Another monarchical group, led by Antoine Barnave and Alexandre de
Lameth, formed a club briefly known to history as the Feuillants, from
their meeting in the convent of Cistercian monks so named. It was a sign
of the rapid secularization of Parisian life that several abandoned
monasteries were now centers of political agitation.</p>
<p>The rival tempers of the clubs showed during the elections which
slowly harvested, from June to September, 1791, the ballots for the new
Assembly. The loyalists, softened to tolerance by education and comfort,
relied on persuasion and bribery to garner votes; the Jacobins and the
Cordeliers, hardened by the marketplace and the streets, seasoned
bribery with force. Interpreting the law to the letter, they kept from
the polls anyone who re- fused to take an oath of allegiance to the new
constitution; so the great ma- jority of practicing Catholics were
automatically excluded. Crowds were organized to raid and disperse
meetings of loyalists, as in Grenoble; in some cities, like Bordeaux,
the municipal authorities forbade all club meetings ex- cept of the
Jacobins; in one town the Jacobins and their followers burned a ballot
box suspected of harboring a conservative majority. 6</p>
<p>Despite such democratic trimmings, the election sent to the
Legislative Assembly a substantial minority dedicated to preserving the
monarchy. These 264 “Feuillants” occupied the right section of the hall,
and thereby gave a name to conservatives everywhere. The 136 deputies
who acknowl- edged themselves Jacobins or Cordeliers sat at the left on
an elevated section called the Mountain; soon they were named
Montagnards. In the center sat 355 delegates who refused to be labeled;
they came to be called the Plain. Of the 755 total 400 were lawyers, as
befitted a lawmaking body; now the lawyers succeeded the clergy in
control of the nation. Nearly all the depu- ties were of the middle
class; the Revolution was still a bourgeois feast.</p>
<p>Until June 20, 1792, the most vigorous group in the legislature was
that which later received the name of the department of the Gironde.
They were not an organized party (nor were the Montagnards), but they
were nearly all from regions of industrial or commercial activity —
Caen, Nantes, Lyons, Limoges, Marseilles, Bordeaux. The inhabitants of
these thriving centers were accustomed to considerable self-rule; they
controlled much of the money, the commerce, the foreign trade of the
realm; and Bordeaux, capital of the Gironde, proudly remembered having
nurtured Montaigne and Mon- tesquieu. Nearly all the leading Girondins
were members of the Jacobin Club, and they agreed with most other
Jacobins in opposing the monarchy and the Church; but they resented the
rule of all France by Paris and its</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>populace, and proposed instead a federal republic of largely
self-governed provinces.</p>
<p>Condorcet was their theorist, philosopher, specialist in education,
finance, and utopia; we have long since paid our debt to him. # Their
great orator was Pierre Vergniaud: born at Limoges of a businessman
father; left a seminary, studied law, practiced at Bordeaux, and was
sent thence to the Legislative Assembly, which repeatedly made him its
president. Still more influential was Jacques-Pierre Brissot, native of
Chartres, something of an adventurer, sampling occupations, climates,
and moral codes in Europe and America, briefly imprisoned in the
Bastille (1784), founder (1788) of the Societe des Noirs Amis, and
sturdy worker for the emancipation of slaves. Sent to the Assembly as a
deputy from Paris, he took charge of foreign policy, and led the way
into war. Condorcet introduced him and Vergniaud to Mme. de Stael; they
became devoted attendants at her salon, and helped her lover, the Comte
de Narbonne-Lara, to appointment as minister of war by Louis XVI. 7 For
a long time the Girondins were called Brissotins.</p>
<p>History remembers better Jean-Marie Roland de La Platiere, chiefly
be- cause he married a brilliant woman who provided him with ideas and
style, deceived him, celebrated his memory, and dignified her ascent to
the guillo- tine with a famous and possibly legendary sentence. When
Jeanne-Manon Phlipon, aged twenty-five, met Jean-Marie at Rouen in 1779,
he was forty- five years old, incipiently bald, and somewhat worn out by
business cares and philosophical rumination. He had a pleasant paternal
smile, and preached a noble stoicism that enchanted Manon. She was
already familiar with the ancient classics and heroes; she had read
Plutarch at the age of eight, some- times substituting him for the
prayerbook when in church; “Plutarch pre - pared me to be a republican.”
8</p>
<p>She was a high- spirited child. “On two or three occasions when
my</p>
<p>father whipped me I bit the thi gh across which he placed me,” 9 and
she never lost her bite. But also she read the lives of the saints, and
propheti- cally longed for martyrdom; she felt the beauty and moving
solemnity of Catholic ritual, and retained her respect for religion, and
some vestiges of the Christian creed, even after relishing Voltaire,
Diderot, d’Holbach, and d’Alembert. She did not take much to Rousseau;
she was too tough for his sentiment. Instead she lost her heart to
Brutus (either one), to both the Catos, and both the Gracchi; it was
from them that she and the Girondins took political ideals. She read,
too, the letters of Mme. de Sevigne, for she aspired to write perfect
prose.</p>
<p>She had suitors, but she was too conscious of her accomplishments to
tol- erate any ordinary lover. Perhaps, at twenty-five, she thought it
best to compromise. She found in Roland “a strong mind, incorruptible
honesty, knowledge, and taste…. His gravity made me consider him, as it
were, without sex.” 10 After their marriage (178 0) they lived in Lyons,
which she described as “a city superbly built and situated, flourishing
in commerce and</p>
<p>Rousseau and Revolution , 894 - 97.</p>
<p>3 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>manufactures,… famed for riches of which even the Emperor Joseph was
envious.” 11 In February, 1791, Roland was sent to Paris to defend the
busi - ness interests of Lyons before the committees of the Constituent
Assembly. He attended meetings of the Jacobin Club, and developed a
close friendship with Brissot. In 1791 he persuaded his wife to move
with him to Paris.</p>
<p>Thert she graduated from his secretary to his adviser; not only did
she draw up his reports with an elegance that revealed her mind and
hand, but she seems to have guided his political policy. On March 10,
1792, through the influence of Brissot, he was made minister of the
interior to the King. Meanwhile Manon established a salon where Brissot,
Petion, Condorcet, Buzot and other Girondins regularly met to formulate
their plans. 12 She gave them food and counsel, and to Buzot her secret
love; and she followed or preceded them bravely to death.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>war: 1792</li>
</ol>
<p>It was a critical period for the Revolution. The emigres , by 1791,
had assembled twenty thousand troops at Coblenz, and were making headway
with their appeals for help. Frederick William II of Prussia listened,
for he thought he might use this opportunity to enlarge his realm along
the Rhine. The Emperor Joseph II of the Holy Roman Empire might have
gone to his sister’s aid, but his people too were in revolt, he was
something of a revo - lutionist himself, and he was dying. His brother
Leopold II, who succeeded him in 1790, was not inclined to war, but he
issued with the King of Prus - sia a cautious “Declaration of Pillnitz”
(August 27, 1791), inviting other rulers to join them in efforts to
restore in France “a monarchical form of government which shall at once
be in harmony with the rights of sovereigns, and promote the welfare of
the French nation.”</p>
<p>Strange to say, both the monarchists and the republicans favored war.
The Queen had repeatedly urged her imperial brothers to come to her res-
cue; and the King had explicitly asked the rulers of Prussia, Russia,
Spain, Sweden, and Austria-Hungary to collect an armed force to restore
the royal power in France. 13 On February 7, 1792, Austria and Prussia
signed a mili- tary alliance against France; Austria was hungry for
Flanders, Prussia for Alsace. On March 1 Leopold II died, and was
succeeded by his son Fran- cis II, who itched for battle by proxy and
for glory in person. In France Lafayette favored war in the nope that he
would be commander in chief, and so be in a position to dictate to both
the Assembly and the King. Gen- eral Dumouriez, minister for foreign
affairs, favored war in expectation that the Netherlands would welcome
him as their liberation from Austria, and might reward him with a minor
crown. Since there was as yet no talk of conscription, the peasantry and
the proletariat accepted war as now a neces- sary evil because the
unhindered return of the emigres would restore and perhaps vengefully
intensify the injustices of the Old Regime. The Giron- dins favored war
because they expected Austria and Prussia to attack France,</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>and counterattack was the best defense. Robespierre opposed the war
on the ground that the proletariat would shed their blood for it, and
the middle class would pocket any gains. Brissot outtalked him; “the
time has come,” he cried, “for a new crusade, a crusade for universal
freedom.” 14 On April 20, 1792, the Legislative Assembly, with only
seven dissenting votes, de- clared war upon Austria only, hoping to
divide the allies. So began the twenty-three years of the Revolutionary
and Napoleonic Wars. On April 26 Rouget de Lisle, at Strasbourg,
composed “The Marseillaise.”</p>
<p>But the Girondins had not calculated on the condition of the French
Army. On the eastern front it numbered 100,000 men, opposing only 45,000
Austrian troops; but they were officered by men nurtured in the Old Re-
gime. When General Dumouriez ordered these officers to lead their
soldiers into action, they replied that their raw volunteers were not
prepared, with either weapons or discipline, to face trained soldiery.
When, nevertheless, the order to advance was repeated, several officers
resigned, and three cavalry regiments went over to the enemy. Lafayette
sent to the Austrian gover- nor at Brussels an offer to lead his
National Guard to Paris and restore the authority of the King if Austria
would agree not to enter French territory. Nothing came of the proposal
except Lafayette’s later impeachment (Au - gust 20, 1792), and his
flight to the enemy.</p>
<p>Matters reached a crisis when the Legislative Assembly sent to the
pre- dominantly Girondist ministry measure s seeking the King’s
signature for the establishment of a protective armed camp around Paris,
and for the dis- continuance of state stipends for nonjuring priests and
nuns. The King, in a flurry of decision, not only refused to sign, but
dismissed all the ministers except Dumouriez, who soon resigned to take
command on the Belgian front. When the news of these vetoes circulated
through Paris it was inter- preted as a sign that Louis was expecting an
army, French or alien, to reach Paris soon and put an end to the
Revolution. Wild plans were made to evacuate the capital, and to form a
new revolutionary army on the farther side of the Loire. The Girondist
leaders spread among the sections a call for a mass demonstration before
the Tuileries.</p>
<p>So on June 20, 1792, an excited crowd of men and women — patriots,
ruf- fians, adventurers, fervent followers of Robespierre, Brissot, or
Marat- forced their way into the courtyard of the Tuileries, shouting
demands and taunts, and insisting on seeing “ Monsieur et Madame Veto.”
The King ordered his guards to let a number of them in. Half a hundred
came, brand- ishing their varied weapons. Louis took his stand behind a
table, and heard their petition — to withdraw his vetoes. He answered
that these were hardly the fit place and circumstances for considering
such complex matters. For three hours he listened to arguments, pleas,
and threats. One rebel shouted, “I demand the sanction of t he decree
against the priests;… either the sanc- tion or you shall die!” Another
pointed his sword at Louis, who remained apparently unmoved. Someone
offered him a red cap; he put it gaily on his head; the invaders
shouted, “Vive la nation! Vive la liber teP’ and finally “ Vive le Roi!”
The petitioners left, and reported that they had given the</p>
<p>3 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>King a good scare; the crowd, dissatisfied but tired, melted back
into the city. The decree against the nonjuring clergy was enforced
despite the veto; but the Assembly, anxious to dissociate itself from
the populace, gave the King an enthusiastic reception when, at its
invitation, he came to accept its pledge of continued loyalty. 15</p>
<p>The radicals did not relish this ceremonious reconciliation of the
bour- geoisie with the monarchy; they suspected the sincerity of the
King, and re- sented the readiness of the Assembly to stop the
Revolution now that the middle class had consolidated its economic and
political gains. Robespierre and Marat were gradually turning the
Jacobin Club from its bourgeois sen- timents to wider popular
sympathies. The proletariat in the industrial cities was moving toward
cooperation with the workers of Paris. When the As- sembly asked each of
the departments to send a detachment of the Federa- tion of National
Guards to join in celebrating the third anniversary of the fall of the
Bastille, these “Federes” were mostly chosen by the city com - munes,
and favored radical policies. One particularly rebel regiment, 516
strong, set out from Marseilles on July 5, vowing to depose the King. On
their march through France they sang the new song that Rouget de Lisle
had composed, and from them it took the name that he had not intended —
“The Marseillaise.”*</p>
<p>The Marseillese and several other delegations of Federes reached
Paris after July 14, but were asked by the Commune of Paris to delay
their re- turn home; it might have need of them. The Commune — the
central bureau of delegates from the forty- eight “sections” of the
city— was now dominated by radical leaders, and was day by day, from its
offices in the Hotel de Ville, replacing the municipal officials as the
government of the capital.</p>
<p>On July 28 the city was again shocked into fear and rage by learning
of the manifesto issued by the Duke of Brunswick from Coblenz:</p>
<p>Their Majesties the Emperor and the King of Prussia having intrusted
to me the command of the united armies which they had collected on the
frontiers of France, I desire to announce, to the inhabitants of that
kingdom, the motives which have determined the policy of the two
sovereigns, and the purposes which they have in view.</p>
<p>After arbitrarily violating the rights of the German princes in
Alsace Lor- raine, disturbing and overthrowing good order and legitimate
government in the interior of the realm,… those who have usurped the
reins of government have at last completed their work by declaring an
unjust war on his Majesty the Emperor, and attacking his provinces in
the Low Countries….</p>
<p>To those important interests should be added another matter of
solicitude,… namely, to put an end to the anarchy in the interior of
France, to check the attacks upon the throne and the altar, to… restore
to the King the security and the liberty of which he is now deprived,
and to place him in a position to exercise once more the legitimate
authority which properly be- longs to him.</p>

<p>39</p>
<p>he faction which dominates it, and that the majority of the people
look for- ward with impatience to the time when they may declare
themselves openly against the odious enterprises of their oppressors,
his Majesty the Emperor and his Majesty the King of Prussia call upon
them and invite them to return with- out delay to the path of reason,
justice, and peace. In accordance with these views I… declare:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>That… the two allied courts entertain no other object than the
welfare of France, and have no intention of enriching themselves by
conquests….</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>The inhabitants of the towns and villages who may dare to defend
them- selves against the troops of their Imperial and Royal Majesties
and fire upon them… shall be punished immediately according to the most
stringent laws of war, and their houses shall be… destroyed….</p></li>
<li><p>The city of Paris and all its inhabitants shall be required to
submit at once and without delay to the King…. Their Majesties declare…
that if the Chateau of the Tuileries is entered by force or attacked, if
the least violence be offered to… the King, the Queen, and the royal
family, and if their safety and liberty be not immediately assured, they
will inflict an ever memorable vengeance by delivering over the city of
Paris to military execution and com- plete destruction….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is for these reasons that I call upon and exhort, in the most
urgent manner, all the inhabitants of the kingdom not to oppose the
movements and operations of the troops which I command, but rather, on
the contrary, to grant them everywhere a free passage, and to assist…
them with all good will….</p>

<p>Charles William Ferdinand,</p>
<p>Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg 16</p>
<p>That somber eighth paragraph (perhaps offered to the amiable Duke by
vengeful emigres 17 ) was a challenge to the Assembly, the Commune, and
the people of Paris to abandon the Revolution or to resist the invaders
by what- ever means and at whatever cost. On July 29 Robespierre,
addressing the Jacobin Club, demanded, as a defiance to Brunswick, the
immediate over- throw of the monarchy, and the establishment of a
republic with manhood suffrage for all. On July 30 the Marseillese
Federes, still in Paris, joined other provincial detachments in pledging
aid in deposing the King. On August 4 and the following days section
after section of the city sent notice to the Assembly that it no longer
acknowledged a king; and on August 6 a petition was presented to the
deputies that Louis should be deposed. The Assembly took no action. On
August 9 Marat published an appeal to the people to invade the
Tuileries, arrest the King and his family, and all pro- monarchical
officials, as “traitors whom the nation… ought first to sacrifice to the
public welfare.” 18 That night the Commune and the sections rang the
tocsin calling for a massing of the people around the Tuileries the next
morning.</p>
<p>Some came as early as 3 a.m.; by seven o’clock twenty -five sections
had sent their quotas of men armed with muskets, pikes, and swords; some
came with cannon; eight hundred Federes joined in; soon the crowd
numbered nine thousand. The palace was defended by nine hundred Swiss
and two hundred other guards. Hoping to discourage violence, Louis led
his family from the royal chambers into the palace theater, where the
Assembly was in</p>

<p>chaotic session; “I come here,” he said, “to prevent a great crime.”
19 The in - surgents were allowed to enter the courtyard. At the foot of
the stairs lead- ing to the King’s bedroom the Swiss forbade further
advance; the crowd pressed against them; the Swiss fired, killing a
hundred or more men and women. The King sent orders to the Swiss to
cease fire and withdraw; they did, but the crowd, led by the
Marseillese, overwhelmed them; most of the Swiss were slain; many were
arrested; fifty were taken to the Hotel de Ville, where they were put to
death. 20 The servants, including the kitchen staff, were slaughtered in
a mad festival of blood. The Marseillese sang “The Mar - seillaise” to
the accompaniment of the Queen’s harpsichord; a tired prosti - tute
rested on the Queen’s bed. The furniture was burned, the wine cellars
were sacked and drained. In the nearby courts of the Carrousel the happy
crowd set fire to nine hundred buildings, and shot at firemen who came
to put out the flames. 21 Some of the victors paraded with banners made
from the red uniforms of the dead Swiss Guards — the first known
instance of a red flag used as the symbol of revolution. 22</p>
<p>The Assembly tried to save the royal family, but the murder of
several deputies by the invading crowd persuaded the remainder to
surrender the royal refugees to the disposition of the Commune. It
locked them under strict guard in the Temple, an old fortified monastery
of the Knights Tem- plar. Louis yielded without resistance, grieving
over his now white-haired wife and his ailing son, and waiting patiently
for the end.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>DANTON</li>
</ol>
<p>During these convulsive weeks the deputies of the Right had almost
all ceased attendance at the Assembly; after August io only 285 remained
of the original 745 members. This rump legislature now voted to replace
the King and his advisers with a provisional Executive Council; an
overwhelming vote chose Georges Danton to head the Council as minister
of justice, Roland to be minister of the interior, Joseph Servan to be
minister of war. The choice of Danton was in part an attempt to quiet
the Parisians, with whom he was very popular; besides, he was at that
time the ablest and strongest character in the revolutionary
movement.</p>
<p>He was thirty-three years old, and would die at thirty-five;
revolution is a prerogative of youth. Bom at Arcis-sur-Aube, in
Champagne, he followed his father into law; he prospered as an attorney
in Paris, but he chose to live in the same building with his friend
Camille Desmoulins, in the Cor- deliers working-class district; soon
they became prominent in the Cor- deliers Club. His lips and nose had
been disfigured by a childhood accident, and his skin was potted with
smallpox; but few remembered this when they confronted his tall figure
and massive head, or felt the force of his perceptive and decisive
thought, or heard his violent — often profane — speech rolling like
thunder over a revolutionary assembly, a Jacobin club, or a proletarian
crowd.</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>His character was not as brutal or domineering as his face or his
voice. He could be rude and apparently unfeeling in his judgment — as in
approving the September Massacres — but he had some tenderness latent in
him, and no venom; he was ready to give and quick to forgive. Oftentimes
his aides were surprised to find him countermanding his own Draconian
orders, or protect- ing victims of his severe instructions; soon he was
to lose his life because he dared to suggest that the Terror had gone
too far, and that a time for mercy had come. Unlike the sober
Robespierre, he relished Rabelaisian humor, worldly pleasures, gambling,
beautiful women. He made and borrowed money; bought a fine home in
Axcis, and large parcels of church property. People wondered how he had
come upon the necessary sums; many sus- pected him of having taken
bribes to protect the King. The evidence against him is overwhelming; 23
yet he committed himself to the most advanced measures of the
Revolution, and seems never to have betrayed any of its vital in
terests. He took the King’s money and worked for the proletariat.</p>
<p>He had too much education to be a utopian. His library (to which he
hoped soon to retire) included 571 volumes in French, seventy-two in
Eng- lish, fifty-two in Italian; he could read English and Italian well.
He had ninety- one volumes of Voltaire, sixteen of Rousseau, all of
Diderot’s Ency - clopedic. 2 * He was an atheist, but he had some
sympathy for the considera- tions that religion offered to the poor.
Hear him in 1790, sounding like Musset a generation later: 25</p>
<p>For my part I admit I have known but one God — the God of all the
world and of justice…. The man in the fields adds to this conception…
because his youth, his manhood, and his old age owe to the priest their
litde mo- ments of happiness…. Leave him his illusions. Teach him if you
will,… but do not let the poor fear that they may lose the one thing
that binds them to life. 26</p>
<p>As a leader he sacrificed everything to the end of preserving the
Revo- lution from foreign attack and internal chaos. For these purposes
he was willing to cooperate with anyone — with Robespierre, Marat, the
King, the Girondins; but Robespierre envied him, Marat denounced him,
the King distrusted him, the Girondins were alarmed by his face and his
voice, and shivered under his scorn. None of them could make him out: he
organized war and negotiated for peace; he roared like a lion and talked
of mercy; he fought for the Revolution and helped some royalists to
escape from France. 27</p>
<p>As minister of justice he labored to unite all revolutionary ranks in
throw- ing back the invaders. He took responsibility for the uprising of
the popu- lace on August 10; the war needed the support of those wild
spirits; they would make ardent soldiers. But he discouraged the
premature attempts to support revolutions against foreign kings; this
would unite all monarchs in hostility to France. He fought against the
proposal of the Girondins to with- draw the government and the Assembly
behind the Loire; such a retreat would shatter the morale of the people.
The time had gone for discussion;</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>it had come for action, for building new armies and fortifying them
with spirit and confidence. On September 2, 1792, in a passionate
speech, he ut- tered a phrase that roused France and rang through a
tumultuous century. The Prussian-Austrian forces had entered France and
were winning victory after victory. Paris hovered between resolute
response and a demoralizing fear. Danton, speaking for the Executive
Council, went before the Assembly to rouse them and the nation to
courage and action:</p>
<p>It is a satisfaction for the minister of a free state to announce to
them that their country is saved. All are stirred, all are enthusiastic,
all burn to enter the contest…. One part of our people will guard our
frontiers, another will dig and arm the entrenchments, the third, with
pikes, will defend the interior of our cities…. We ask that anyone
refusing to give personal service, or to fur- nish arms, shall meet the
punishment of death….</p>
<p>The tocsin we shall sound is not the alarm signal of danger; it
orders the charge on the enemies of France. To conquer we have to dare,
to dare again, always to dare — and France is saved! [De I’audace,
encore de I’audace, toujours I’audace — et la France est sauvee!<br />
</p>
<p>It was a powerful historic speech, but on that same day the most
tragic episode of the Revolution began.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE MASSACRE: SEPTEMBER 2-6, 1 792</li>
</ol>
<p>The emotional fever that came to its peak on September 2 took some
remote sources of its heat from the swelling conflict between religion
and the state, and the effort to make worship of the state a substitute
for religion. The Constituent Assembly had accepted Catholicism as the
official religion, and had undertaken to pay the priests as salaried
employees of the state. But the dominant radicals in the Paris Commune
saw no reason why the gov- ernment should finance the propagation of
what it looked upon as an Ori- ental myth so long allied with feudalism
and monarchy. These views found acceptance in the clubs, and finally in
the Legislative Assembly. The result was a series of measures that made
the enmity of Church and state a recur- rent threat to the
Revolution.</p>
<p>A few hours after the dethronement of the King the Commune sent to
the sections a list of priests suspected of antirevolutionary sentiments
and aims; as many of these as could be apprehended were sent to various
prisons, where they soon played a leading part in the massacres. On
August 1 1 the Assembly ended all control of education by the Church. On
August 1 2 the Commune forbade the public wearing of religious
vestments. On August 1 8 the Assembly renewed a nationwide decree to the
same effect, and sup- pressed all surviving religious orders. On August
28 it called for the deporta- tion of all priests who had not sworn
allegiance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; they were given a
fortnight in which to leave France; some 25,000 priests fled to other
lands, and reinforced there the propaganda of the emigres. Since the
clergy had heretofore kept parish registers of births, marriages, and
deaths, the Assembly had to transfer this function to</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>lay authorities. As most of the population insisted on solemnizing
these events with sacraments, the attempt to discard the ancient
ceremonies wid- ened the breach between the piety of the people and the
secularism of the state. 28 The Commune, the Jacobins, the Girondins,
and the Montagnards all concurred in hoping that devotion to the young
republic would become the religion of the people; that Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity would re- place God, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, and that the furtherance of the new Trinity could be made the
overriding aim of social order and the final test of morality.</p>
<p>The official opening of the new republic was deferred to September
22, first day of the new year. Meanwhile some eager futurists petitioned
the Assembly that, as a gesture toward the universal democracy of their
dreams, “the title of French citizen should be granted to all foreign
philosophers w ho have with courage upheld the cause of liberty and have
deserved well of humanity.” On August 26 the Assembly responded by
conferring French - ligion seemed to be spreading its branches so soon
after taking root.</p>
<p>On September 2 it put on its Sunday clothes, and expressed its
devotion in diverse ways. Young and middle-aged men gathered at
recruiting points to volunteer for service in the Army. Women lovingly
sewed warm gar- ments for them, and grimly prepared bandages for
prospective wounds. Men, women, and children came to their section
centers to offer weapons, jewelry, money for the war. Mothers adopted
children dependent upon sol- diers or nurses who were leaving for the
front. Some men went to the prisons to kill priests and other enemies of
the new faith.</p>
<p>Ever since the Duke of Brunswick’s manifesto (J uly 25, 1792) the
revo- lutionary leaders had acted as men tend to act when their lives
are threat- ened. On August 1 1 the public commissioners at the Hotel de
Ville sent a strange note to Antoine Santerre, then in military command
of the sec- tions: “We are informed that a plan is being formed for
going round the prisons of Paris and carrying off all the prisoners, in
order to execute prompt justice upon them. We beg you to extend your
supervision to those of the Chatelet, the Conciergerie, and La Force”—
three main centers of detention in Paris. 31 We do not know how Santerre
interpreted this message. On Au- gust 14 the Assembly appointed an
“extraordinary tribunal” to try all enemies of the Revolution; but the
sentences there decreed fell far short of satisfying Marat. In his Ami
du Peuple of August 19 he told his readers: “The wisest and best course
to pursue is to go armed to the Abbaye [another</p>
<p>44 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>Marat its official editor, assigned him a place in its assembly room,
and added him to its Comite de Surveillance. 33</p>
<p>If the populace heard Marat, and obeyed him to the best of their
ability, it was because they too were in a fury and tremor of hate and
fear. On Au- gust 19 the Prussians had crossed the frontiers, led by
King Frederick Wil- liam II and the Duke of Brunswick, and accompanied
by a small force of emigres vowing vengeance upon all revolutionists. On
August 23 the in- vaders captured the Fortress of Longwy, allegedly
through connivance by its aristocratic officers; by September 2 they had
reached Verdun, and a premature report reached Paris that morning that
this supposedly impregna- ble bastion had fallen (it fell that
afternoon); now the road to Paris was open to the enemy, for no French
army was on that route to stop them. The capital seemed at their mercy;
the Duke of Brunswick expected soon to dine in Paris. 34</p>
<p>Meanwhile revolution against the Revolution had broken out in far
sepa- rate regions of France — the Vendee and Dauphine; and Paris itself
harbored thousands of people who sympathized with the fallen King. Since
Septem- ber 1 a pamphlet had been circulating which warned that a plot
existed to free the prisoners and lead them in a massacre of all
revolutionists. 35 The Assembly and the Commune were calling upon all
able-bodied men to join the army that would march out to meet the
advancing enemy; how could these men leave their women and children to
the mercy of such an outpour- ing of royalists, priests, and habitual
criminals from the prisons of Paris? Some sections voted a resolution
that all priests and suspected persons should be put to death before the
departure of the volunteers. 36</p>
<p>About 2 p.m. Sunday, September 2, six carriages bearing nonjuring
priests approached the Abbaye jail. A crowd hooted them; a man leaped
upon the step of one carriage; a priest struck him with a cane; the
crowd, cursing and multiplying, attacked the prisoners as they alighted
at the gate; their guards joined in the attack upon them; all thirty
were slain. Exalted by the sight of blood and the safe ecstasy of
anonymous killing, the crowd rushed over to the Carmelite Convent and
killed the priests who had been incarcerated there. In the evening,
after a rest, the crowd, now enlarged by criminals and ruffians, and by
lusty Federes troops from Marseilles, Avignon, and Brittany, returned to
the Abbaye, forced all its prisoners to march out, sat in a rapid
informal judgment upon them, and delivered the great majority of them —
any Swiss or priest, or monarchist, or ex-servant of the King or Queen —
to a gauntlet of men who dispatched them with swords, knives, pikes, and
clubs.</p>
<p>At first the executioners were exemplary; there was no thievery — the
valuables taken from the victims were transmitted to the Communal
authori- ties; later the tired laborers kept such trophies as their due.
Each received, for a day’s work, six francs, three meals, and all the
wine he wanted. Some showed signs of tenderness; they congratulated
those exonerated, and es- corted the distinguished among them to their
homes. 37 Some were especially ferocious; they prolonged the sufferings
of the condemned for the keener</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>amusement of spectators; and one enthusiast, after withdrawing his
sword from General Laleu’s breast, inserted his hand into the wound,
tore out the heart, and put it to his mouth as if to eat it 38 — a
custom once popular in savage days. Each killer, when tired, took a
rest, drank, and soon resumed his labors, until all the prisoners in the
Abbaye had passed through the street- side court to liberty or
death.</p>
<p>On September 3 the judges and the executioners moved toward other
prisons — La Force and the Conciergerie; there, with fresh workers and
new victims, the holocaust went on. Here was a famous lady, the
Princesse de Lamballe, once very rich and very beautiful, beloved of
Marie Antoinette; she had shared in plots to save the royal family; now,
forty-three years old, she was beheaded and mutilated; her heart was
snatched out of her body, and was eaten by a fervent republican; 39 her
head was borne on a pike and paraded beneath a window of the Queen’s
cell at the Temple. 40</p>
<p>On September 4 the slaughter moved to the prisons of Tour
St.-Bernard, St.-Firmin, the Chatelet, the Salpetriere; there, in the
case of young women, rape replaced murder. Among the inmates at Bicetre,
an insane asylum, were forty-three youths, from seventeen to nineteen
years of age, most of them placed there by their parents for treatment;
all were slain. 41</p>
<p>For two days more the massacre continued in Paris, until its victims
to- taled between i,247 42 and i,3 6 8. 43 The people were divided in
judgment on the event: Catholics and royalists were horrified, but
revolutionists argued that the violent response was warranted by the
threats of Brunswick and the exigencies of war. Petion, the new mayor of
Paris, received the executioners as hard-working patriots, and refreshed
them with drink. 44 The Legislative Assembly sent some members to the
Abbaye scene to recommend due pro- cess of law; they returned to report
that the massacre could not be stopped; finally the Assembly leaders —
Girondins as well as Montagnards — agreed that the safest attitude was
one of approval. 45 The Commune sent representatives to share in the
task of the extempore judges. Billaud-Varenne, deputy attor- ney for the
Commune, joined the scene at the Abbaye, and congratulated the killers:
“Fellow citizens, you are immolating your enemies; you are per - forming
your duty.” 46 Marat proudly took credit for the entire operation. At
her trial a year later Charlotte Corday, asked why she had killed Marat,
answered, “Because it was he who caused the massacres of September.”</p>
<p>When Danton was asked to stop the slaughter he shrugged his
shoulders; “it would be impossible,” he argued; and “why,” he asked,
“should I dis - turb myself about those royalists and priests, who were
only waiting the approach of foreigners to massacre us?… We must put our
enemies in fear.” 48 Secretly he withdrew from the prisons more than one
of his friends, and even some of his personal enemies. 49 When a fellow
member of the Executive Council protested against the killings Danton
told him, “Sit down. It was necessary.” 50 And to a youth who had asked,
“How can you help calling it horrible?” he answered, “You are too young
to understand these</p>
<p>4 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>matters…. A river of blood had to flow between the Parisians and the
emigres.” 51 The Parisians, he thought, were now pledged to the
Revolution. And those volunteers who were leaving to meet the invaders
knew now that they could expect no mercy if they surrendered. They would
in every sense be fighting for their lives.</p>
<p>September 2 was also the day on which the Legislative Assembly,
feeling that the turn of events had made a ruin of the constitution
which it had been chosen to implement, voted to call a national election
for a Convention that would draw up a fresh constitution suited to the
new condition of France and the rising demands of the war. And since
peasants, proletaires, and bour- geois alike were being called to defend
a country called theirs, it seemed in- tolerable that any of these,
taxpayers or not, should be kept from the ballot box. So Robespierre won
his first major victory: the Convention in which he was to be a major
figure was chosen by manhood suffrage.</p>
<p>On September 20 the Legislative Assembly ended its last session, not
knowing that on that day, at a village called Valmy, between Verdun and
Paris, a French army under Dumouriez and Fran§ois-Christophe Kellermann
had met the professional troops of Prussia and Austria under the Duke of
Brunswick, and had fought them to a draw — in effect a victory, since
after the battle the King of Prussia ordered his battered regiments to
retreat- abandoning Verdun and Longwy — from French territory. Frederick
Wil- liam II could not afford to be bothered with distant France now
that he was competing with his neighbors Russia and Austria to see which
would take the biggest bite in partitioning Poland; moreover, his
soldiers were suffering disgracefully from diarrhea inflicted by the
grapes of Champagne. 52</p>
<p>It was at that battle that Goethe, present on the staff of the Duke
of Saxe- Weimar, made (we are told) a famous remark: “From today and
from this place begins a new epoch in the history of the world.” 53</p>
