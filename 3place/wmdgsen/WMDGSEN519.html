<p>I. THE CONFESSIONS</p>
<p>H OW did it come about that a man born poor, losing his mother at</p>
<p>birth and soon deserted by his father, afflicted with a painful
and</p>
<p>hu milia ting disease, left to wander for twelve years among alien
cities and conflicting faiths, repudiated by society and civilization,
repudiating Vol- taire, Diderot, the Ency elope die, and the Age of
Reason, driven from place to place as a dangerous rebel, suspected of
crime and insanity, and seeing, in his last months, the apotheosis of
his greatest enemy — how did it come about that this man, after his
death, triumphed over Voltaire, revived religion, transformed education,
elevated the morals of France, inspired the Roman- tic movement and the
French Revolution, influenced the philosophy of Kant and Schopenhauer,
the plays of Schiller, the novels of Goethe, the poems of Wordsworth,
Byron, and Shelley, the socialism of Marx, the ethics of Tolstoi, and,
altogether, had more effect upon posterity than any other writer or
thinker of that eighteenth century in which writers were more
influential than they had ever been before? Here, if anywhere, the
problem faces us: what is the role of genius in history, of man versus
the mass and the state?</p>
<p>Europe was ready for a gospel that would exalt feeling above thought.
It was tired of the restraints of customs, conventions, manners, and
laws. It had heard enough of reason, argument, and philosophy; all this
riot of un- moored minds seemed to have left the world devoid of
meaning, the soul empty of imagination and hope; secretly men and women
were longing to believe again. Paris was weary of Paris, of the turmoil
and hurry, the con- finement and mad competition of city life; now it
idealized the slower pace of the countryside, where a simple routine
might bring health to the body and peace to the mind, where one might
see modest women again, where all the village would meet in weekly
armistice at the parish church. And this proud “progress,” this vaunted
“emancipation of the mind”— had they put anything in place of what they
had destroyed? Had they given man a more intelligible or inspiring
picture of the world and human destiny? Had they improved the lot of the
poor, or brought consolation to bereavement or pain? Rousseau asked
these questions, gave form and feeling to these doubts; and after his
voice was stilled all Europe listened to him. While Voltaire was beiqg
idolized on the stage and at the Academy (1778), and while Rousseau,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>berated and despised, hid in the obscurity of a Paris room, the age
of Rous- seau began.</p>
<p>In the decline of his life he composed the most famous of
autobiographies, the Confessions. Sensitive to every criticism,
suspecting Grimm, Diderot, and others of a conspiracy to blacken him in
Paris salons and in the Memoires of Mme. d’£pinay, he began in 1762, on
the urging of a publisher, to write his own account of his history and
character. All autobiography, of course, is vanity, but Rousseau,
condemned by the Church, outlawed by three states, and deserted by his
closest friends, had the right to defend himself, even at great length.
When he read some passages of this defense to gather- ings in Paris, his
foes secured a government ban on further public readings of his
manuscript. Discouraged, he left it at his death with a passionate plea
to posterity:</p>
<p>Here is the sole human portrait — painted exactly after nature in all
truth — that now exists or that will probably ever exist. Whoever you
are, whom my fate and confidence have made the arbiter of this record, I
beg you, by my mis- fortunes and by your fellow feeling, and in the name
of all mankind, not to destroy a work useful and unique, which can serve
as a first piece of compari- son for the study of man,… and not to take
from the honor of my memory the only sure monument of my character that
has not been disfigured by my enemies. 1</p>
<p>His extreme sensitivity, subjectivity, and sentiment made the virtues
and the faults of his book. “A feeling heart,” he said, “… was the
foundation of all my misfortunes”; 2 but it gave a warm intimacy to his
style, a tender - ness to his recollections, often a generosity to his
judgments, that melt our antipathy as we read. Here everything abstract
becomes personal and alive; every line is a feeling; this book is the
fountainhead of the Mississippi of introspective self-revelations that
watered the literature of the nineteenth century. Not that the
Confessions had no forebears; but even St. Augustine could not match the
fullness of this self-denudation, or its claim to truth. It begins with
a burst of challenging eloquence:</p>
<p>I am forming an enterprise which has had no example, and whose
execution will have no imitator. I wish to show my fellow men a man in
all the truth of nature; and this man shall be myself.</p>
<p>Myself alone. I know my heart, and I am acquainted with men. 1 am not
made like any one of those who exist. If I am not better, at least I am
different. If nature has done well or ill in breaking the mold in which
I was cast, this is something of which no one can judge except after
having read me.</p>
<p>Let the trumpet of the Last Judgment sound when it will, I shall
come, this book in hand, to present myself before the Sovereign Judge. I
shall say loudly: “This is how I have acted, how I have thought, what I
have been. I have told the good and the bad with the same candor. I have
concealed nothing of evil, added nothing of good…. I have shown myself
as I was: despicable and vile when I was so, good, generous, sublime,
when I was these; and I have un- veiled my inmost soul… 3</p>
<p>This claim to complete sincerity is repeated again and again. But
Rousseau admits that his remembrance of things fifty years past is often
fragmentary</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>and unreliable. In general Part I has an air of candor that is
disarming; Part II is disfigured by wearisome complaints of persecution
and conspiracy. Whatever else the book is, it is one of the most
revealing psychological studies known to us, the story of a sensitive
and poetic spirit in painful con- flict with a hard and prosai c
century. In any case, “the Confessions, if it were not an autobiography,
would be one of the great novels of the world.” 4 *</p>

<p>“I was born at Geneva in 1712, son of Isaac Rousseau and Suzanne Ber
- nard, citizens.” This last word meant much, for only sixteen hundred
of Geneva’s twenty thousand souls had the name and rights of citizen,
and this was to enter into Jean- Jacques’ history. His family was of
French origin, but had been settled in Geneva since 1529. His
grandfather was a Calvinist minister; the grandson remained basically a
Calvinist through all the wander- ings of his faith. The father was a
master watchmaker, imaginative and un- stable, whose marriage (1704)
brought him a dowry of sixteen thousand florins. After the birth of a
son Frangois he left his wife (1705) and traveled to Constantinople,
where he remained for six years. Then he came back, for reasons unknown,
and “I was the sad fruit of this return.” 8 The mother died of puerperal
fever within a week of Jean- Jacques’ birth. “I came into the world with
so few signs of life that little hope was entertained of preserving me”;
an aunt nursed and saved him, for which, he said, “I freely forgive
you.” This aunt sang well, and may have given him his lasting taste for
music. He was precocious and soon learned to read, and, since Isaac
loved romances, father and son read together the romances left in the
mother’s little library; Jean-Jacques was brought up on a mixture of
French love stories, Plutarch’s Lives, and Calvinist morality, and the
mixture unsteadied him. He described himself accurately enough as “at
once haughty and</p>

<p>6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>ender, a character effeminate and yet invincible, which, fluctuating
between weakness and courage, luxury and virtue, has ever set me in
contradiction to myself.” 9</p>
<p>In 1722 the father quarreled with a Captain Gautier, gave him a
bloody nose, was summoned by the local magistrate, fled from the city to
escape imprisonment, and took up residence at Nyon, thirteen miles from
Geneva. A few years later he married again. Frangois and Jean-Jacques
were taken over by their uncle Gabriel Bernard. Frangois was apprenticed
to a watch- maker, ran away, and disappeared from history. Jean-Jacques
and his cousin Abraham Bernard were sent to a boarding school operated
by Pastor Lam- bercier at the neighboring village of Bossey. “Here we
were to learn Latin, with all the insignificant trash that has obtained
the name of education.” 10 The Calvinist catechism was a substantial
part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>He liked his teachers, especially the pastor’s sister, Mile.
Lambercier. She was thirty, Jean-Jacques was eleven, so he fell in love
with her, after his own queer fashion. When she whipped him for some
misbehavior he took delight in suffering at her hands; “a degree of
sensuality mingled with the smart and</p>
<p>Thus I passed the age of puberty, with a constitution extremely
ardent, with- out knowing or even wishing for any other gratification of
the passions than what Miss Lambercier had innocently given me an idea
of; and when I be- came a man that childish taste, instead of vanishing,
only associated with the other. This folly, joined to a natural
timidity, has always prevented me from being very enterprising with
women, so that I have passed my days languishing in silence for those I
most admired, without daring to disclose my wishes….</p>
<p>I have now made the first and most difficult step in the obscure and
painful maze of my Confessions. We never feel so great a degree of
repugnance in divulging what is really criminal, as what is merely
ridiculous. 12</p>
<p>It is possible that in later life Rousseau found an element of
pleasure in feel- ing himself buffeted by the world, by his enemies, and
by his friends.</p>
<p>Next to Mile. Lambercier’s chastisements he enjoyed the magnificent
scenery that surrounded him. “The country was so charming… that I
conceived a passion for rural life which time has not been able to
extin- guish.” 13 Those two years at Bossey were probably the happiest
that he ever experienced, despite his discovery of injustice in the
world. Punished for an offense that he had not committed, he reacted
with lasting resentment, and thereafter he “learned to dissemble, to
rebel, to lie; all the vices common to our years began to corrupt our
happy innocence.” 14</p>
<p>He never advanced further in formal or classical education; perhaps
his lack of balance, judgment, and self-control and his subordination of
reason to feeling were in part due to the early end of his schooling. In
1724, aged twelve, he and his cousin were recalled to the Bernard
household. He visited his father at Nyon, and there fell in love with a
Mile. Vulson, who rejected him, and then with Mile. Goton, who, “while
she took the greatest liberties</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>with me, would never permit any to be taken with her in return.” 15
After a year of vacillations he was apprenticed to an engraver in
Geneva. He liked drawing, and learned to engrave watchcases, but his
master beat him severely for some minor offenses, and “drove me to vices
I naturally despised, such as falsehood, idleness, and thef t.” The once
happy boy turned into a morose and unsociable introvert.</p>
<p>He consoled himself with intense reading of books borrowed from a
nearby library, and with Sunday excursions into the countryside. On two
occasions he dallied so long in the fields that he found the city gates
closed when he tried to return; he spent the night in the open, reported
for work half dazed, and received a special thrashing. On a third such
occasion the memory of these beatings made him resolve not to return at
all. Not yet sixteen (March 15, 1728), without money, and with nothing
but the clothes on his back, he marched on to Confignon in Catholic
Savoy, some six miles away.</p>
<p>There he knocked at the door of the village priest, Pere Benoit de
Pont- verre. Perhaps he had been told that the old cure was so anxious
to convert stray Genevans that he fed them well on the theory that a
full stomach makes for an orthodox mind. He gave Jean- Jacques a good
dinner, and bade him “go to Annecy, where you will find a good and
charitable lady whom the bounty of the king enables to turn souls from
those errors she has hap- pily renounced.” 16 This, Rousseau adds, was
“Mme. de Warens, a new con - vert, to whom the priests contrived to send
those wretches who were dis- posed to sell their faith; and with these
she was in a manner constrained to share a pension of two thousand
francs bestowed upon her by the King of Sardinia.” The homeless youth
thought a part of that pension might be worth a Mass. Three days later,
at Annecy, he presented himself to Mme. Fran-Louise de La Tour, Baronne
de Warens.</p>
<p>She was twenty-nine, pretty, gracious, gentle, generous, charmingly
dressed; “there could not be a more lovely face, a finer neck, o r
handsome arms more exquisitely formed”; 17 altogether she was the best
argument for Catholicism that Rousseau had ever seen. Born in Vevey of
good family, she had been married, quite young, to M. (later Baron) de
Warens of Lausanne. After some years of painful incompatibility she left
him, crossed the lake into Savoy, and won the protection of King Victor
Amadeus, then at Evian. Domiciled at Annecy, she accepted conversion to
Catholicism, with the con- viction that if her religious ritual were
correct God would pardon her an occasional amour; besides, she could not
believe that the gentle Jesus would send men — surely not a beautiful
woman — to everlasting hell. 18</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques would gladly have stayed with her, but she was occupied;
she gave him money, and bade him go to Turin and receive instruction in
the Hospice of the Holy Spirit. He was received there on April 12, 1728,
and on April 21 he was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. Writing
thirty-four years later — eight years after his return to Protestantism
— he de- scribed with horror his experience in the hospice, including an
attempt upon his virtue by a Moorish fellow catechumen; he imagined that
he had ap-</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>proached conversion with revulsion, shame, and long delays. But
apparently he adjusted himself to the conditions that he found in the
hospice, for he re- mained there, uncompelled, over two months after
being received into the Church of Rome. 19</p>
<p>He left the hospice in July, armed with twenty-six francs. After a
few days of sightseeing he found work in a store to which he had been
drawn by the good looks of the lady behind the counter. He fell in love
with her at once; soon he knelt before her and offered her a lifetime of
devotion. Mme. Basile smiled, but let him go no further than her hand;
besides, her husband was expected at any minute. “My want of success
with women,” says Rous - seau, “has ever proceeded from my having loved
them too well”; 20 but it was his nature to find greater ecstasy in
contemplation than in fulfillment. He relieved his tumescence by “that
dangerous supplement which deceives nature, and saves young men of my
temperament from many disorders, but at the expense of their health,
their vigor, and sometimes their life.” 21 This practice, made hectic by
terrifying prohibitions, may have played a secret role in promoting his
irritability, his romantic fancies, his discomfort in so- ciety, his
love of solitude. Here the Confessions are frank beyond precedent:</p>
<p>My thoughts were incessantly occupied with girls and women, but in a
manner peculiar to myself. These ideas kept my senses in a perpetual and
dis- agreeable activity…. My agitation rose to the point where, unable
to satisfy my desires, I inflamed them with the most extravagant
maneuvers. I went about seeking dark alleys, hidden retreats, where I
might expose myself at a distance to persons of the [other] sex in the
state wherein I would have wished to be near them. That which they saw
was not the obscene object — I did not dream of that; it was the
ridiculous object [the buttocks]. The foolish pleasure which I had in
displaying it before their eyes cannot be described. From this there was
but a step to the desired treatment [whipping]; and I do not doubt that
some resolute woman, in passing, would have given me the amusement, if I
had had the audacity to continue….</p>
<p>One day I went to place myself at the back of a court in which was a
well where the young women of the house often came to fetch water…. I
of- fered to the girls… a spectacle more laughable than seductive. The
wisest among them pretended to see nothing; others began to laugh;
others felt in- sulted, and raised an alarm.</p>
<p>Alas, no girl offered to beat him; instead a guardsman came, with
heavy sword and frightful mustache, followed by four or five old women
armed with brooms. Rousseau saved himself by explaining that he was “a
young stranger of high lineage , whose mind was deranged,” but whose
means might enable him later to reward their forgiveness. The “terrible
man was touched,” and let him go, much to the discontent of the old
women. 22</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had found employment as a liveried footman in the
service of Mme. de Vercellis, a Turinese lady of some culture. There he
committed a crime which weighed on his conscience through the rest of
his life. He stole one of Madame’s colorful ribbons; when charged with
the theft he pretended that another servant had given it to him. Marion,
who was quite innocent of the theft, reproached him prophetically: “Ah,
Rousseau, I thought you were of a good disposition. You render me very
unhappy, but</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>I would not be in your situation.” 23 Both were dismissed. The
Concessions adds:</p>
<p>I do not know what became of the victim of my calumny, but there is
little probability of her having been able to place herself agreeably
after this, as she labored under an imputation cruel to her character in
every respect…. The painful remembrance of this transaction… has
remained heavy on my conscience to this day; and I can truly say that
the desire to relieve myself in some measure from it has contributed
greatly to the resolve to write my Confessions. 24</p>
<p>Those six months as a footman left a mark on his character; with all
his consciousness of genius he never achieved self-respect. A young
priest whom he met while serving Mme. de Vercellis encouraged him to
believe that his faults could be overcome if he would sincerely seek to
approach the ethics of Christ. Any religion, said “M. Gaime,” is good if
it spreads Christian con - duct; hence he suggested that Jean-Jacques
would be happier if he returned to his native habitat and faith. These
views of “one of the best men I ever knew” lingered in Rousseau’s
memory, and inspired famous pages in Emile. A year later, in the
Seminary of St.-Lazare, he met another priest, Abbe Gatier, a “very
tender heart,” who missed advancement because he had con - ferred
pregnancy upon a maiden in his parish. “This,” remarks Rousseau, “was a
dreadful scandal in a diocese severely good, where the priests (being
under good regulation) ought never to have children — except by married
women.” 25 From “these two worthy priests I formed the character of the
Savoyard Vicar.”</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1729 Rousseau, now seventeen, felt again the
call of the open road; moreover, he hoped that with Mme. de Warens he
might find some employment less galling to his pride. Along with a jolly
Genevan lad named Bade, he marched from Turin to and through the Mont
Cenis pass of the Alps to Chambery and Annecy. His romantic pen colored
the emotions with which he approached Mme. de Warens’ dwelling. “My legs
trembled under me, my eyes were clouded with a mist, I neither saw,
heard, nor recollected anyone, and was obliged frequently to stop that I
might draw breath and recall my bewildered senses.” 26 Doubtless he was
uncertain of his reception. How could he explain to her all his
vicissitudes since leaving her? “Her first glance banished all my fears.
My heart leaped at the sound of her voice. I threw myself at her feet,
and in transports of the most lively joy I pressed my lips upon her
hand.” 27 She did not resent adoration. She found a room for him in her
house; and when some eyebrows rose she said, “They may talk as they

abandon him.”</p>
<p>hi. maman: 1729 — 40</p>
<p>He was intensely attracted to her, like any youth in proximity with a
femme de trente ans. He furtively kissed the bed on which she had
slept,</p>
<p>io ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>he chair she had sat on, “nay, the floor itself when I considered she
had walked there” 28 (here we suspect that romance got the better of
history); and he was furiously jealous of all who competed with him for
her time. She let him purr, and called him petit chat (little cat) and
enfant; gradually he resigned himself to calling her Maman. She employed
him to write letters, keep her accounts, gather herbs, and help in her
alchemical experiments. She gave him books to read — The Spectator,
Pufendorf, Saint-Lvremond, Vol- taire’s Henriade. She herself liked to
browse in Bayle’s Dictionnaire histo - rique et critique. She did not
let her theology discommode her; and if she enjoyed the company of
Father Gros, superior of the local seminary, it might be because he
helped to lace her stays. “While he was thus employed she would run
about the room, this way or that as occasion happened to call her. Drawn
by the laces, M. le Superieur followed grumbling, repeating at every
moment, ‘Pray, Madame, do stand still’; the whole forming a scene truly
diverting.” 29</p>
<p>It was perhaps this jolly priest who suggested that though
Jean-Jacques gave every sign of stupidity he might digest enough
education to make him a village cure. Mme. de Warens, glad to find a
career for him, agreed. So in the fall of 1729 Rousseau entered the
Seminary of St.-Lazare, and pre- pared for priesthood. By this time he
had become accustomed to Catholi- cism, even fond of it; 30 he loved its
solemn ritual, its processions, music, and incense, its bells that
seemed to proclaim, every day, that God was in his heaven, and that all
was — or would be — right with the world; besides, no religion could be
bad that charmed and forgave Mme. de Warens. But he had received so
little formal education that he was first subjected to a con- centrated
course in the Latin language. He could not suffer its declensions,
conjugations, and exceptions patiently; after five months of effort, his
teach- ers sent him back to Mme. de Warens with the report that he was
“a toler - ably good lad,” but not fit for holy orders.</p>
<p>She tried again. Having observed his flair for music, she introduced
him to Nicoloz Le Maitre, organist at the Annecy cathedral. Jean-Jacques
went to live with him through the winter of 1729-30, consoled by being
only twenty paces from Maman. He sang in the choir and played the flute;
he loved the Catholic hymns; he was well fed, and happy. All went well
except that M. Le Maitre drank too much. One day the little choirmaster
quarreled with his employers, gathered his music in a box, and left
Annecy. Mme. de Warens bade Rousseau accompany him as far as Lyons.
There Le Maitre, overcome with delirium tremens, fell senseless in the
street. Frightened, Jean-Jacques called the passers-by to his aid. He
gave them the address which the music master was seeking, and then fled
back to Annecy and Maman. “The tenderness and truth of my attachment to
her had uprooted from my heart every imaginable project, and all the
follies of ambition. I conceived no happiness but in living near her,
nor could I take a step with- out feeling that the distance between us
was increased.” 31 We must remem - ber that he was still only eighteen
years old.</p>
<p>When he reached Annecy he found that Madame had left for Paris,
and</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>no one knew when she would return. He was desolate. Day after day he
walked aimlessly into the countryside, comforting himself with the
colors of spring and the pretty chatter of doubtless amorous birds.
Above all he loved to rise early and watch the sun lifting itself
triumphantly above the horizon. On one of these rambles he saw two
damsels on horseback, urging their reluctant mounts to ford a stream. In
a burst of heroism he caught one horse by the bridle and led it across,
while the other followed. He was about to go on his way, but the girls
insisted upon his accompanying them to a cottage where he might dry his
shoes and stockings. At their invitation he leaped up behind Mile. G.
“When it became necessary to clasp her in order to hold myself on, my
heart beat so violently that she perceived it”; 32 at that moment he
began to outgrow his infatuation for Mme. de Warens. The three
youngsters spent the day picnicking together; Rousseau progressed to
kissing one girl’s hand; then they left him. He returned to Annecy
exalted, and hardly minded that Maman was not there. He tried to find
those made- moiselles again, but failed.</p>
<p>Soon he was on the road once more, this time accompanying Mme. de
Warens’ maid to Fribourg. Passing through Geneva “I found myself so
affected that I could scarcely proceed,… the image of [republican]
liberty so elevated my soul.” 33 From Fribourg he walked to Lausanne. Of
all writers known to history he was the most devoted walker. From Geneva
to Turin to Annecy to Lausanne to Neuchatel to Bern to Chambery to Lyons
he knew the road and drank in gratefully the sights, odors, and
sounds.</p>
<p>I love to walk at my ease, and stop at leisure; a strolling life is
necessary for me. Traveling on foot, in a fine country, with fine
weather, and having an agreeable object to terminate my journey, is the
manner of living most suited to my taste. 34</p>
<p>Uncomfortable in the society of educated men, shy and wordless before
beautiful women, he was happy when alone with woods and fields, water
and sky. He made Nature his confidante, and in silent speech told her
his loves and dreams. He imagined that the moods of Nature entered at
times into a mystic accord with his own. Though he was not the first to
make men feel the loveliness of Nature, he was her most fervent and
effective apostle; half the nature poetry since Rousseau is part of his
lineage. Haller had felt and described the majesty of the Alps, but
Rousseau made the slopes of Switzerland along the northern shore of the
Lake of Geneva his special realm, and he sent down through the centuries
the fragrance of their ter- raced vines. When he came to choose a site
for the home of his Julie and Wolmar he placed them here, at Clarens
between Vevey and Montreux, in a terrestrial paradise mingling
mountains, verdure, water, sun, and snow.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful in L ausanne, Rousseau moved to Neuchatel: “Here,… by
teaching music, I insensibly gained some knowledge of it.” 35 At nearby
Boudry he met a Greek prelate who was soliciting funds for restoring the
Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem; Rousseau joined him as interpreter, but at
Soleure he left him and walked out of Switzerland into France. On this
walk</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>he entered a cottage and asked might he buy some dinner; the peasant
offered him barley bread and milk, saying this was all he had; but when
he saw that Jean-Jacques was not a tax collector he opened a trapdoor,
de- scended, and came up with wheat bread, ham, eggs, and wine. Rousseau
offered to pay; the peasant refused, and explained that he had to hide
his better food lest he suffer additional taxation. “What he said to me…
made an impression on my mind that can never be effaced, sowing seeds of
that inextinguishable hatred which has since grown up in my heart
against the vexations these unhappy people bear, and against their
oppressors.” 36 At Lyons he spent homeless days, sleeping on park
benches, or the ground. For a time he was engaged to copy music. Then,
hearing that Mme. de Warens was living at Chambery (fifty-four miles to
the east), he set out to rejoin her. She found work for him as secretary
to the local intendant (1732-34). Meanwhile he lived under her roof, his
happiness only moder- ately lessened by the discovery that her business
manager, Claude Anet, was also her lover. That his own passion had
subsided appears from a unique passage in the Confessions:</p>
<p>I could not learn, without pain, that she lived in greater intimacy
with an- other than with myself…. Nevertheless, instead of feeling any
aversion to the person who had this advantage over me, I found the
attachment I felt for her actually extended to him. I desired her
happiness above all things, and since he was concerned in her plan of
felicity, I was content he should be happy likewise. Meantime he entered
perfectly into the views of his mistress; he con- ceived a sincere
friendship for me; and thus… we lived in a union which rendered us
mutually happy, and which death alone could dissolve. One proof of the
excellence of this amiable woman’s character is that all who loved her
loved each other, even jealousy and rivalry submitting to the more
powerful sentiment with which she inspired them; and I never saw any of
those who surrounded her entertain the least ill will among themselves.
Let the reader pause a moment in this encomium, and if he can recollect
any other woman who deserves it, let him attach himself to her if he
would obtain happiness. 37</p>
<p>The next step in this polygonal romance was just as contrary to all
the rules of adultery. When she perceived that a neighbor, Mme. de
Menthon, aspired to be the first to teach Jean-Jacques the art of love,
Mme. de Warens, refusing to surrender this distinction, or desiring to
keep the youth from less tender arms, offered herself to him as
mistress, without prejudice to her similar services for Anet.
Jean-Jacques took eight days to think it over; long acquaintance with
her had made him filial rather than sensual in his thoughts of her; “I
loved her too much to desire her.” 38 He was already suffering from the
ailments that were to pursue him to the end — inflammation of the
bladder and stricture of the urethra. Finally, with all due modesty, he
agreed to her proposal.</p>
<p>The day, more dreaded than hoped for, at length arrived…. My het.rt
confirmed my engagements without desiring the prize. I obtained it
neverthe- less. I saw myself for the first time in the arms of a woman,
and a woman whom I adored. Was I happy? No. I tasted pleasure, but I
know not what invincible sadness poisoned the charm. I felt as if I had
committed incest. Two or three times, while pressing her with transport
in my arms, I deluged her bosom with</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>my tears. As for her, she was neither sad nor gay; she was
caressingly tranquil. Since she was hardly at all sensual, and had not
at all sought pleasure, she had in this no ecstasy, and she never felt
remorse. 39</p>
<p>Recalling this epochal event, Rousseau ascribed Madame’s maneuvers to
the poison of philosophy.</p>
<p>I repeat, all her failings were the result of her error, never of her
passions. She was well born, her heart was pure, her manners noble, her
desires regular and virtuous, her taste delicate; she seemed formed for
that elegant purity of manners which she ever loved but never practiced,
because, instead of listening to the dictates of her heart, she followed
those of her reason, which led her astray…. Unhappily, she piqued
herself on philosophy, and the morality which she drew from it spoiled
that which her heart proposed. 40</p>
<p>Anet died in 1734. Rousseau left his post with the intendant and took
over the management of Madame’s business affairs. He found them
perilously confused, near bankruptcy. He brought in some income by
teaching music; in 1737 he received three thousand francs falling due
from his mother’s legacy; he spent part of this on books, and gave the
rest to Mine, de Warens. He fell ill, and Maman nursed him tenderly. As
her dwelling had no garden, she rented (1736) a suburban cottage, Les
Charmettes. There “my life passed in the most absolute serenity.” Though
he “never loved to pray in a chamber,” the outdoors stirred him to thank
God for the beauty of nature, and for Mme. de Warens, and to ask the
divine blessing on their union. He was at this time firmly attached to
the Catholic theology, with a somber Jansenist tinge. “The dread of hell
frequently tormented me.” 41</p>
<p>Bothered by “the vapors”— a then fashionable form of hypochondria —
and thinking that he had a polypus near his heart, he traveled by
stagecoach to Montpellier. En route he eased his melancholy by allegedly
consummating a liaison with Mme. de Larnage (1738), mother of a
fifteen-year-old girl. Re- turning to Chambery, he found that Mme. de
Warens was trying a similar cure, having taken as her new lover a young
wigmaker named Jean Wint- zenried. Rousseau protested; she called him
childish, and assured him that there was room in her love for two Jeans.
He refused to “thus degrade her,” and proposed to resume his status quo
ante as son. She professed consent, but her resentment at being so
readily surrendered cooled her affection for him. He retired to Les
Charmettes and took to philosophy.</p>
<p>Now for the first time (c. 1738) he became conscious of the
Enlighten- ment breezes that were blowing from Paris and Cirey. He read
some works of Newton, Leibniz, and Pope, and browsed in the maze of
Bayle’s Diction - naire. He took up Latin again, made more progress by
himself than formerly with teachers, and managed to read bits of Virgil,
Horace, and Tacitus, and a Lat in translation of Plato’s Dialogues.
Montaigne, La Bruyere, Pascal, Fenelon, Prevost, and Voltaire came to
him as a dizzy revelation. “Nothing that Voltaire wrote escaped us”;
indeed, it was Voltaire’s books that “in - spired me with a desire to
write elegantly, and caused me to endeavor to imitate the colorings of
that author, with whom I was so enchanted.” 42 In - sensibly the old
theology that had been the frame of his thoughts lost its</p>
<p>H</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>form and rigor; and he found himself entertaining without horror a
hundred heresies that would have seemed scandalous to his youth. An
almost passion- ate pantheism replaced the God of the Bible. There was a
God, yes, and life would be meaningless and unbearable without him; but
he was not the ex- ternal, vengeful deity conceived by cruel and fearful
men, he was the soul of Nature, and Nature was fundamentally beautiful,
and human nature was basically good. On this and Pascal Rousseau would
build his philosophy.</p>
<p>In 1740 Mme. de Warens found a post for him as tutor to the children
of M. Bonnot de Mably, grand provost of Lyons. He parted from her with
no reproach on either side; she prepared his wardrobe for the trip, and
wove some garments for it with her own once entrancing hands.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>LYONS, VENICE, PARIS: 1740-49</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mably family was a new intellectual stimulus for Rousseau. The
pro- vost was the eldest of three distinguished brothers; one was the
almost com- munist Gabriel Bonnot de Mably; another was the almost
materialist Abbe Etienne Bonnot de Condillac; and Rousseau met all
three. Of course he fell in love with Mme. de Mably, but she was
gracious enough to take no notice of it, and Jean-Jacques had to mind
his business of educating her two sons. He drew up for M. de Mably a
statement of his pedagogical ideas; in part these accorded with the
libertarian principles that were to receive their classical romantic
exposition in Emile twenty-two years later; in part they contradicted
his later rejection of “civilization,” for they recognized the value of
the arts and sciences in the development of mankind. Meeting fre-
quently men like Professor Bordes of the Lyons Academy (who was a friend
of Voltaire), he imbibed more of the Enlightenment, and learned to laugh
at popular ignorance and superstition. But he remained ever adolescent.
Peeping into the public baths one day, he saw a young woman quite unen-
cumbered; his heart stopped beating. Back in the stealth of his room he
ad- dressed to her a bold but anonymous note:</p>
<p>I hardly dare confess to you. Mademoiselle, the circumstances to
which 1 owe the happiness of having seen you, and the torment of loving
you…. It is less that figure, light and svelte, which loses nothing by
nudity; it is less that elegant form, those graceful contours;… it is
not so much the freshness of lilies spread with such profusion over your
person — but that soft blush… which I saw covering your brow when I
offered myself to your sight after having unmasked you too mischievously
by singing a couplet. 43</p>
<p>He was now old enough to fall in love with young women. Almost any
presentable girl set him longing and dreaming, but especially Suzanne
Serre. “O nce — alas, only once in my life! — my mouth touched hers. O
memory! shall I lose you in the grave?” He began to think of marriage,
but he con - fessed, “I have nothing but my heart to offer.” 44 As this
was not legal tender</p>
<p>He had not been made to be either a successful lover or a good
teacher.</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>*5</p>
<p>I had almost as much knowledge as was necessary for a tutor,… and the
natural gentleness of my disposition seemed calculated for the
employment, if hastiness had not mingled with it. When things went
favorably, and I saw the pains, which I did not spare, succeed, I was an
angel; but when they went contrary I was a devil. If my pupils did not
understand me I was hasty; when they showed any symptoms of an untoward
disposition I was so provoked that I could have killed them…. I
determined to quit my pupils, being convinced that I should never
succeed in educating them properly. M. de Mably saw this as clearly as
myself, though I am inclined to think he would never have dis- missed me
had I not spared him the trouble. 45</p>
<p>So, sadly resigning or gently dismissed, he took the diligence back
to Chambery, seeking again t he solace of Maman’s arms. She received him
kindly, and gave him a place at her table with her paramour; but he was
not happy in the situation. He buried himself in books and music, and
contrived a system of musical notation that used figures instead of
notes. When he resolved to go to Paris and submit his invention to the
Academy of Sciences everybody applauded his resolution. In July, 1742,
he returned to Lyons to seek letters of introduction to notables in the
capital. The Mablys gave him letters to Fontenelle and the Comte de
Caylus, and Bordes introduced him to the Due de Richelieu. From Lyons he
took the public coach to Paris, dream- ing of greatness.</p>
<p>France was at this time engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession
(1740-48) ; but as the conflict was fought on foreign soil, Paris went
on with its life of gilded gaiety, intellectual agitation, theaters
mouthing Racine, salons sparkling with heresy and wit, bishops reading
Voltaire, beggars com- peting with prostitutes, hawkers crying their
wares, artisans sweating for bread. Into this maelstrom came
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, aged thirty, in August, 1742, with fifteen livres
in his purse. He took a room in the Hotel St.-Quentin, Rue des
Cordeliers, near the Sorbonne — “a vile street, a miser - able hotel, a
wretched apartment.” 46 On August 22 he presented to the Academy his
Projet concernant de nouveaux signes pour la notation musi- cale. The
savants rejected his project with handsome compliments. Rameau
explained: “Your signs are very good,… but they are objectionable on
account of their requiring an operation of the mind, which cannot always
accompany the rapidity of execution. The position of our notes is
described to the eye without the concurrence of th is operation.”
Rousseau confessed the objection to be insurmountable. 47</p>
<p>Meanwhile his letters of introduction had given him access to
Fontenelle, who, now eighty-five, was too cautious of his energy to take
him seriously; and to Marivaux, who, though busy with success as both
novelist and drama- tist, read Rousseau’s manuscript comedy Narcisse ,
and suggested improve - ments. The newcomer met Diderot, who, one year
younger than Jean- Jacques, had as yet published nothing of
importance.</p>
<p>He was fond of music, and knew it theoretically;… and he communi-
cated to me some of his literary projects. This soon formed between us a
more intimate connection, which lasted fifteen years, and which probably
would still exist were not I, unfortunately,… of the same profession as
himself 48</p>
<p>1 6 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>With Diderot he went to the theater, or played chess; in that game
Rousseau met Philidor and other experts, and “had no doubt but in the e
nd I should become superior to them all.” 49 He found entrance to the
home and salon of Mme. Dupin, daughter of the banker Samuel Bernard, and
struck up a friendship with her stepson, Claude Dupin de Francueil.
Meanwhile he could see the bottom of his purse.</p>
<p>He began to look about him for some occupation that would supplement
his friends in feeding him. Through the influence of Mme. de Besenval he
was offered the post of secretary to the French embassy in Venice. After
a long journey made hazardous by the war, he reached Venice in the
spring of 1743, and reported to the ambassador, the Comte de Montaigu.
This count, Rousseau assures us, was almost illiterate; the secretary
had to de- cipher as well as to compose documents; he presented the
messages of the French government to the Venetian Senate in his own
person — not having forgotten the Italian he had learned in Turin. He
was proud of his new status, and complained that a merchant vessel which
he visited gave him no cannonade in salute, thou gh “people of less
consequence received it.” 50 Mas - ter and man quarreled as to who
should pocket the fees paid for the secre- tary’s issuance of passports
to France. With his share Rousseau prospered, ate unusually well,
attended theater and opera, and fell in love with Italian music and
girls.</p>
<p>One day, “not to appear too great a blockhead among my associates,”
he visited a prostitute, La Padoana. He asked her to sing; she did; he
gave her a ducat, and turned to leave; she refused to take the coin
without having earned it. He satisfied her, and returned to his lodgings
“so fully persuaded that I should feel the consequences of this step
that the first thing I did was to send for the King’s surgeon to ask him
for medicine”; but the doctor “persuaded me that I was formed in such a
manner as not to be readily infected.” 51 Some time later his friends
gave him a party, at which the pretty harlot Zulietta was to be the
prize. She invited him to her room, and dis- robed. “Suddenly, instead
of being devoured by flame, I felt a deadly chill run through my veins,
and sick at heart, I sat down and wept like a child.” He later explained
his incapacity on the ground that one of the woman’s breasts was
deformed. Zulietta turned upon him in scorn and bade him “leave women
alone, and study mathematics.” 52</p>
<p>M. de Montaigu, his own salary being in arrears, withheld Rousseau’s.
They quarreled again; the secretary was dismissed (August 4, 1744).
Rous- seau complained to his friends in Paris; an inquiry was sent to
the ambassa- dor; he replied: “I must inform you how greatly we have
been deceived by the Sire Rousseau. His temper and his insolence, caused
by the high opinion he has of himself, and by his madness, are the
things that hold him in the state in which we found him. 1 drove him out
like a bad valet.” 53 Jean - Jacques returned to Paris (October 1 1),
and presented his side of the matter to officials in the government;
they offered him no redress. He appealed to Mme. de Besenval, she
refused to receive him. He sent her a passionate letter in which we can
feel the heat of the distant Revolution:</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>I was wrong, Madame; I thought you just, and you are only noble
[titled]. I should have remembered that. I should have perceived that it
was improper for me, a foreigner and plebeian, to complain against a
gentleman. If my destiny should ever again put me in the grip of an
ambassador of the same stuff, I shall suffer without complaint. If he is
wanting in dignity, without ele- vation of soul, it is because nobility
dispenses with all that; if he is associated with all that is vile in
one of the most immoral of cities, it is because his an- cestors have
created enough honor for him; if he consorts with knaves, if he is one
himself, if he deprives a servitor of wages, ah, then, Madame, I shall
think only how fortunate it is not to be the son of one’s own deeds!
Those ancestors — who were they? Persons of no repute, without fortune,
my equals; they had talent of some kind, they made a name for
themselves; but nature, which sows the seed of good and evil, has given
them a pitiful posterity. 54</p>
<p>And in the Concessions Rousseau added:</p>
<p>The justice and futility of my complaints left in my mind seeds of
indigna- tion against our foolish social institutions, by which the
welfare of the public and real justice are always sacrificed to I know
not what appearance of order, which does nothing more than add the
sanction of public authority to the op- pression of the weak and the
iniquity of the powerful. 55</p>
<p>Montaigu, returning to Paris, sent Ro usseau “some money to settle my
account…. I received what was offered me, paid all my debts, and re-
mained as before, with not a franc in my pocket.” Re -established at the
Hotel St.-Quentin, he supported himself by copying music. When the cur-
rent Due d’Orleans, hearing of his poverty, gave him music to copy and
fifty louis, Rousseau kept five and returned the rest as overpayment.
56</p>
<p>He earned too little to support a wife, but he thought that with
stoic economy he could afford a mistress. Among those who ate at his
table in the Hotel St.-Quentin were the landlady, some impecunious
abbes, and a young woman who served the hotel as laundress or
seamstress. Therese Levasseur was as timid as Jean-Jacques, and as
conscious — though not so proud — of poverty. When the abbes teased her
he defended her; she came to look upon him as her protector; soon they
were in each other’s arms (1746). “I began by declaring to her that I
would never either abandon or marry her.” 57 She confessed that she was
not a virgin, but assured him that she had sinned only once, and long
ago. He forgave her magnanimously, assuring her that a virgin twenty
years old was a rarity in Paris in any case.</p>
<p>She was a simple creature, devoid of all charm, free of all coquetry.
She could not talk philosophy or politics like a salonniere , but she
could cook, keep house, and put up patiently with his strange moods and
ways. Usually he spoke of her as his “housekeeper,” and she spoke of him
as “my man.” He rarely took her with him on visits to his friends, for
she remained per- manently adolescent mentally, as he remained
permanently adolescent mor- ally.</p>
<p>I at first tried to improve her mind, but in this my pains were
useless. Her mind is as nature formed it; it was not susceptible of
cultivation. I do not blush in acknowledging she never knew how to read
well, although she writes toler- ably…. She could never enumerate the
twelve months of the year in order, or distinguish one numeral from
another, notwithstanding all the trouble I took</p>
<p>l8 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>endeavoring to teach her. She neither knows how to count money, nor
to reckon the price of anything. The word which, when she speaks, comes
to her mind is frequently the opposite of that which she means to use. I
formerly made a dictionary of her phrases to amuse M. de Luxembourg, and
her qui pro quos often became celebrated among those with whom I was
most intimate. 58</p>
<p>When she became pregnant he “was thrown into t he greatest embarrass-
ment”; what could he do with children? Some friends assured him it was
quite customary to send unwanted offspring to a foundling asylum. When
the infant came this was done, over Therese’s protests but with the co -
operation of her mother (1747). In the next eight years four other
children came, and were disposed of in the same way. Some skeptics have
suggested that Rousseau never had any children, and that he invented
this story to hide his impotence, but his many apologies for this
shirking of responsibility make this theory improbable. He privately
confessed his behavior in this matter to Diderot, Grimm, and Mme.
d’Epinay; 59 he implicitly acknowl - edged it in Emile; he raged against
Voltaire for making it public; in the Confessions he admitted it
explicitly, and expressed remorse. He was not made for family life,
being a skinless mass of nerves, and a wanderer in body and soul. He
missed the sobering care of children, and never quite became a man.</p>
<p>He had the good fortune, about this time, to find lucrative
employment. He served as secretary to Mme. Dupin, then to her nephew;
and when Du- pin de Francueil became receiver-general Rousseau was
promoted to cashier at a thousand francs a year. He adopted the gold
braid, white stockings, wig, and sword by which men of letters, to get
entrance to aristocratic homes, imitated aristocratic dress; 60 we can
imagine the discomfort of his divided personality. He was received in
several salons, and made new friends: Raynal, Marmontel, Duclos, Mme.
d’Epinay, and, most intimately and fatally, Fried - rich Melchior Grimm.
He attended the exciting dinners at the home of Baron d’Holbach, where
Diderot slew gods with what his enemies ca lled the jaw- bone of an ass.
In that den of infidels most of Jean- Jacques’ Catholicism melted
away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he wrote music. In 1743 he had begun a combination of opera
and ballet which he called Les Muses galantes, celebrating the loves of
Anacreon, Ovid, and Tasso; this was produced in 1745, with some eclat,
at the home of the tax collector La Popeliniere. Rameau shrugged it off
as a pasticcio of plagiarisms from Italian composers, but the Due de
Richelieu liked it, and commissioned Rousseau to revise an opera-ballet,
Les Festes de Ramire, tentatively prepared by Rameau and Voltaire. On
December 11, 1 745, Rousseau wrote his first letter to the literary
monarch of France:</p>
<p>For fifteen years I have been working to render myself worthy of your
re- gard, and of the kindness with which you favor young Muses in whom
you discover talent. But, through having written the music for an opera,
I find my- self metamorphosed into a musician. Whatever success my
feeble efforts may have, they will be glorious enough for me if they win
me the honor of being known to you, and of having shown the admiration
and profound respect with which I have the honor of being, sir, your
humble and most obedient servitor. 61</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>Voltaire replied: “Sir, you unite in yourself two talents which have
always been found separate till now. Here are two good reasons why I
should es- teem and like you.”</p>
<p>With such love letters began their famous enmity.</p>
<p>V. IS CIVILIZATION A DISEASE?</p>
<p>In 1 749 Diderot was imprisoned at Vincennes for some offensive
passages in his Letters on the Blind. Rousseau wrote to Mme. de
Pompadour pleading for his friend’s release, or permission to share his
imprisonment. Several times during that summer he made the round trip of
ten miles between Paris and Vincennes to visit Diderot. On one such
journey he took an issue of the Mercure de France to read as he walked.
So he came upon the announcement of a prize offered by the Academy of
Dijon for the best essay on the ques- tion: “Has the restoration of the
sciences and the arts contributed to corrupt</p>
<p>All at once I felt myself dazzled by a thousand sparkling lights.
Crowds of vivid ideas thronged into my mind with a force and confusion
that threw me into unspeakable agitation; 1 felt my head whirling in a
giddiness like that of intoxication. A violent palpitation oppressed me.
Unable to walk for difficulty in breathing, I sank down under one of the
trees by the road, and passed half an hour there in such a condition of
excitement that when I rose I saw that the front of my waistcoat was all
wet with tears…. Ah, if ever I could have written a quarter of what 1
saw and felt under that tree, with what clarity I should have brought
out all the contradictions of our social system! With what simplicity I
should have demonstrated that man is by nature good, and that only our
institutions have made him bad! 82</p>
<p>That last sentence was to be the theme song of his life, and those
tears that streaked his vest were among the headwaters of the Romantic
movement in France and Germany. Now he could pour out his heart against
all the arti- ficiality of Paris, the corruption of its morals, the
insincerity of its fine manners, the licentiousness of its literature,
the sensuality of its art, the snobbishness of class divisions, the
callous extravagance of the rich financed by exactions from the poor,
the desiccation of the soul by the replacement of religion with science,
of feeling with logic. By declaring war on this degeneration he could
vindicate his own simplicity of culture, his village manners, his
discomfort in society, his disgust with malicious gossip and irreverent
wit, his defiant retention of religious faith amid the atheism of his
friends. In his heart he was again a Calvinist, remembering with a kind
of homesickness the morality expounded to him in his youth. By answering
Dijon he would exalt his native Geneva above Paris, and would explain
to</p>
<p>20 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>himself and others why he had been so happy in Les Charmettes, and
was so miserable in the salons.</p>
<p>Arrived at Vincennes, he revealed to Diderot his intention to
compete. Diderot applauded him, and bade him attack the civilization of
their time with all possible force. Hardly any other competitor would
dare take that line, and Rousseau’s position would stand out as
individual.* Jean -Jacques returned to his lodgings eager to destroy the
arts and sciences that Diderot was preparing to exalt in the
Encyclopedic , on Dictionnaire raisonne des sciences , des arts, et des
metiers (1751 f.).</p>
<p>I composed the Discourse in a very singular manner…. 1 dedicated to
it the hours of the night in which sleep deserted me; I meditated in bed
with my eyes closed, and in my mind I turned over and over again my
periods with incredible labor and care…. As soon as the Discourse was
finished I showed it to Diderot. He was satisfied with the production,
and pointed out some cor- rections he thought should be made…. I sent
off the piece without men- tioning it to anybody [else], except, I
think, to Grimm. 65</p>
<p>The Dijon Academy crowned his essay with the first prize (August
23,</p>
<p>17.50) — a gold medal and three hundred francs. Diderot, with
characteristic enthusiasm, arranged for the publication of this Discours
sur les arts et les sciences, and soon he reported to the author: “Your
Discours is taking be - yond all imagination; never was there an
instance of a like success.” 66 It was as if Paris realized that here,
at the very mid-point of the Enlightenment, a man had risen to challenge
the Age of Reason, and to challenge it with a voice that would be
heard.</p>
<p>The essay seemed at first to applaud the victories of reason:</p>
<p>It is a noble and beautiful spectacle to see man raising himself, so
to speak, from nothing by his own exertions; dissipating by the light of
reason all the thick clouds by which he was by nature enveloped;
mounting above himself, soaring in thought even to the celestial
regions, encompassing with giant strides, like the sun, the vast extent
of the universe; and what is still grander and more wonderful, going
back into himself, there to study man and get to know his own nature,
his duties, and his end. All these miracles we have seen renewed within
the last few generations. 67</p>
<p>Voltaire must have shed an approving smile over this initial ecstasy;
here was a new recruit to the philosophes, to the good companions who
would slay superstition and Vinfame; and was not this young Lochinvar
already con- tributing to the Encyclopedic? But a page later the
argument took a dis- tressing turn. All this progress of knowledge, said
Rousseau, had made governments more powerful, crushing individual
liberty; it had replaced the simple virtues and forthright speech of a
ruder age with the hypocrisies of savoir-faire.</p>
<ul>
<li>A minor controversy obscures the narrative at this point. Diderot,
in 1782, reported Rous- seau’s visit in a manner reconcilable with
Rousseau’s account: “When… Rousseau came to consult me about the view he
should adopt, ‘The part you will take,’ I said, ‘is that which others
would reject.’ ‘You are right,’ said he.” 63 Marmontel, about 1793, q
uoted Diderot as having dissuaded Rousseau from taking the affirmative
stand. “ T shall follow your advice,’ said Rousseau.” 64</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Sincere friendship, real esteem, and perfect confidence are banished
from among men. Jealousy, suspicion, fear, coldness, reserve, hate, and
fraud lie constantly concealed under that uniform and deceitful veil of
politeness, that boasted candor and urbanity, for which we are indebted
to the light and lead- ing of this age…. Let the arts and sciences claim
the share they have had in this salutary work ! 68</p>
<p>This corruption of morals and character by the progress of knowledge
and art is almost a law of history. “Egypt became the mother of
philosophy and the fine arts; s oon she was conquered.” 69 Greece, once
peopled by heroes, twice vanquished Asia; “letters” were then in their
infancy, and the virtues of Sparta had not been replaced, as the Greek
ideal, by the refinement of Athens, the sophistry of the Sophists, the
voluptuous forms of Praxiteles; when that “civilization” had reached its
height it was overthrown at a blow by Philip of Macedon, and then
supinely accepted the yoke of Rome. Rome conquered the whole
Mediterranean world when she was a nation of peasants and soldiers
inured to a stoic discipline; but when she relaxed into epicurean
indulgence, and praised the obscenities of Ovid, Catullus, and Martial,
she became a theater of vice, “a scorn among the nations, an object of
derision even to barbarians.” 70 And when Rome revived in the
Renaissance, arts and letters again sapped the strength of governed and
governors, and left Italy too feeble to meet attack. Charles VIII of
France mastered Tuscany and Naples almost without drawing a sword, “and
all h is court attributed this unexpected success to the fact that the
princes and nobles of Italy applied themselves with greater earnestness
to the cultivation of their understandings rather than to active and
martial pursuits.” 71</p>
<p>Literature itself is an element of decay.</p>
<p>It is related that the Caliph Omar, being asked what should be done
with the library of Alexandria, answered… , “If the books in the library
contain anything contrary to the Koran, they are evil and ought to be
burned; if they contain only what the Koran teaches, they are
superfluous.” This reasoning has been cited by our men of letters as the
height of absurdity; but if Gregory the Great had been in the place of
Omar, and the Gospel in the place of the Koran, the library would still
have been burned, and it would have been perhaps the finest action of
his life. 72</p>
<p>Or consider the disintegrating effect of philosophy. Some of these
“lovers of wisdom” tell us that there is no such thing as matter; ano
ther assures us that nothing but matter exists, and no other God but the
universe itself; a third group announces that virtue and vice are mere
names, and nothing counts but strength and skill. These philosophers
“sap the foundations of our faith, and destroy virtue. They smile
contemptuously at such old words as patriotism and religion , and
consecrate their talents… to the destruc- tion and defamation of all
that men hold most sacred.” 73 In antiquity such nonsense did not long
survive its auth or, but now, thanks to print, “the pernicious
reflections of Hobbes and Spinoza will last forever.” Consequently, the
invention of printing was one of the greatest disasters in the history
of mankind, and “it is easy to see that sovereigns will hereafte r take
as much</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>pains to banish this dreadful art from their dominions as they ever
took to encourage it.” 74</p>
<p>Note the vigor and excellence of those peoples who never knew
philosophy or science, literature or art: the Persians of Cyrus’ time,
the Germans as described by Tacitus, or, “in our own time, that rustic
nation [Switzerland] whose renowned courage not even adversity could
conquer, and whose fidelity no example could corrupt.” To these the
proud Genevan adds “those happy nations, which did not know even the
names of many vices that we find it hard to suppress — the savages of
America, whose simple and natural mode of government Montaigne
preferred, without hesitation, not only to the laws of Plato, but to the
most perfect visions of government that philosophy can suggest.” 75</p>
<p>What, then, should be our conclusion? It is that</p>
<p>luxury, profligacy, and slavery have been in all ages the scourge of
the efforts of our pride to emerge from that happy state of ignorance in
which the wis- dom of Providence has placed us…. Let men learn for once
that nature would have preserved them from science as a mother snatches
a dangerous weapon from the hands of her child. 76</p>
<p>The answer to the question of the learned Academy is that learning
without virtue is a snare; that the only real progress is moral
progress; that the ad- vancement of learning has corrupted, rather than
purified, the morals of mankind; and that civilization is not an ascent
of man to a nobler state, but the fall of man from a rural simplicity
that was a paradise of innocence and bliss.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Discourse Rousseau checked himself, and looked
with some trepidation at the shambles of science, art, literature, and
philos- ophy that he had left in his wake. He recalled that his friend
Diderot was preparing an encyclopedia dedicated to the progress of
science. Suddenly he discovered that some philosophers — e.g., Bacon and
Descartes — were “s ub- lime teachers,” and he proposed that living
specimens of the breed should be welcomed as counselors by the rulers of
states. Had not Cicero been made consul of Rome, and the greatest of
modern philosophers been made chancel- lor of England ? 77 Perhaps
Diderot had slipped these lines in, but Jean-Jacques had the last
word:</p>
<p>As for us, ordinary men, upon whom Heaven has not been pleased to
bestow such great talents,… let us remain in our obscurity…. Let us
leave to others the task of instructing mankind in their duty, and
confine our- selves to the discharge of our own…. Virtue! sublime
science of simple minds,… are not your principles graven upon every
heart? Need we do more, to learn your laws, than… listen to the voice of
conscience?… This is the true philosophy, with which we must learn to be
content. 78</p>
<p>Paris did not know whether to take this Discourse seriously or to
interpret it as a mischievous essay in hyperbole and paradox, tongue in
cheek. It was said by some (Rousseau tells us 79 ) that he did not
believe a word of it. Diderot, who believed in science but fretted under
the restraints of conven- tion and morality, apparently approved of
Rousseau’s exaggerations as a</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>needed chastisement of Parisian society; and members of the court
applauded the essay as a long-deserved rebuke to insolent and subversive
philosophers. 80 There must have been many sensitive spirits who were,
like this eloquent author, ill at ease in the babble and sparkle of
Paris. Rousseau had expressed a problem that appears in every advanced
society. Are the fruits of tech- nology worth the haste, strains,
sights, noises, and smells of an industrialized life? Does enlightenment
undermine morality? Is it wise to follow science to mutual destruction,
and philosophy to disillusionment with every fortifying hope?</p>
<p>A dozen critics rose to the defense of civilization: Bordes of the
Lyons Academy, Lacat of the Rouen Academy, Forntey of the Berlin
Academy, and not least the genial Stanislas Leszczynski, once king of
Poland, now duke of Lorraine. Scholars pointed out that the diatribe
merely enlarged the doubts that Montaigne had voiced in his essay “On
Cannibals.” Others heard the voice of Pascal retreating from science to
religion, and of course a thousand “doctors and saints” had long since
condemned civilization as a disease or a sin. Theologians could claim
that the “innocence” and happiness of the “state of nature” from which,
in Rousseau’s theory, man had lapsed was only the Eden story retold;
“civilization” took the place of “original sin” as causing the fall of
man; in both cases the desire for knowledge had ended bliss.
Sophisticates like Voltaire wondered that a man thirty -seven years old
should have written such a juvenile jeremiad against the achievements of
science, the boon of good manners, and the inspirations of art. Artists
like Boucher might well have squirmed un der Rousseau’s lash, but
artists like Chardin and La Tour could have charged him with
indiscriminate generaliza- tion. Soldiers smiled at the tender
musician’s exaltation of martial qualities and perpetual readiness for
war.</p>
<p>Rousseau’s friend Grimm protested against any return to “nature.”
“What devilish nonsense!” he exclaimed, and asked a thorny question:
“What is ‘nature’?” 81 Bayle had remarked: “There is scarcely a word
that is used more vaguely than… nature…. The conclusion is not certain
that because ‘this comes from nature, therefore this is good and right.’
We see in the human species many very bad things, although it cannot be
doubted that they are the work of nature.” 82 Rousseau’s conception of
primitive nature was of course a romantic idealization; nature (life
without social regulation and protection) is “red in tooth and claw,”
and its ultimate law is, Kill or be killed. The “nature” that Jean
-Jacques loved, as in Vevey or Clarens, was a nature civilized — tamed
and refined by man. In truth, he did not want to go back to primitive
conditions, with all their filth, insecurity, and physical violence; he
wished to return to the patriarchal family cultivating the soil and
living on its fruits. He longed to be freed from the rules and
restraints of polished society — and from the classic style of
moderation and reason. He hated Paris and yearned for Les Charmettes.
Toward the end of his life, in Les Reveries d’un promeneur solitaire, he
idea lized his maladaptation:</p>
<p>I was bom the most confiding of men, and for forty years together
never was this confidence deceived for a single time. Falling suddenly
among another</p>
<p>24 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>order of persons and things, I slipped into a thousand snares…. Once
con- vinced that there was nothing but deceit and falsity in the
grimacing demon- strations which had been lavished upon me, I passed
rapidly to the other ex- treme…. I became disgusted with men…. I have
never been truly ac- customed to civil society, where all is worry,
obligation, duty, and where my natural independence renders me always
incapable of the subjections necessary to whoever wishes to live among
men. 83</p>
<p>And in the Concessions he bravely adm itted that this first Discourse
, “though full of force and fire, was absolutely wanting in logic and
order; of all the works I ever wrote it is the weakest in reasoning, and
the most devoid of number [prose rhythm? ] and harmony.” 84</p>
<p>Nevertheless he replied vigorously to his critics, and reaffirmed his
para- doxes. He made an exception as a courtesy to Stanislas: on second
thought he decided not to burn the libraries or close the universities
and academies; “all we should gain by th is would be to plunge Europe
once more into barbarism”; 85 and “when men are corrupt it is better for
them to be learned than ignorant.” 86 But he recanted no item in his
indictment of Parisian society. To mark his withdrawal from it he
discarded sword and gold braid and white stockings, and dressed in the
simple garb and smaller wig of the middle class. “Thus,” said Marmontel,
“from that moment he chose the role he was to play, and the mask he was
to wear.” 87 If it was a mask it was so well and persistently worn that
it became part of the man, and changed the face of history.</p>

<li>PARIS AND GENEVA: 1750-54</li>
</ol>
<p>In December, 1750, Rousseau suffered so severely from his bladder
ailment that he was confined to his bed for six weeks. This misfortune
increased his tendency to melancholy and privacy. His rich acquaintances
sent him their own physicians, but the medical science of the time had
not equipped them to help him. “The more I submitted to their direction,
the yellower, thinner, and feebler I became. My imagination… presented
to me, on this side of the tomb, nothing but continued sufferings from
the gravel, stone, and re- tention of urine. Everything which gave
relief to others — ptisans, baths, and bleeding — increased my
tortures.” 88</p>
<p>Early in 175 1 Therese presented him with a third child, which
followed its predecessors to the foundling asylum. He later explained
that he was too poor to bring up children, that they would have been
ruined by being reared by the Levasseurs, and that they would have
played havoc with his work as a writer and a musician. His sickness had
compelled him to resign his position and income as cashier for Dupin de
Francueil; henceforth he supported himself chiefly by copying music at
ten sous the page. Through the negligence of Diderot, or the parsimony
of the publishers, Rousseau received nothing from the sale of his
Discourse. His music proved more profitable than his philosophy.</p>
<p>On October 18, 1752, through Duclos ’ influence, Rousseau’s operetta,
he Devin du village , was presented before King and court at
Fontainebleau, and</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>with such success that it was repeated there a week later. A
performance for the public in Paris (March 1, 1753) won a wider acclaim,
and the retiring author found himself again a celebrity. The little
intermede , for which Rous- seau had written both words and music, was
almost an obbligato to the Discourse: the shepherdess Colette, saddened
by the flirtations of Colin with urban demoiselles, is instructed by the
village soothsayer to win him back by flirtations of her own; Colin,
jealous, returns, and together they sing ballads praising rural as
against city life. Rousseau attended the premiere, and was almost
reconciled to society:</p>
<p>There is no clapping before the King; therefore everything was heard,
which was advantageous to the author and the piece. I heard about me the
whispering of women, who appeared as beautiful as angels. They said to
one another, in a low voice: “This is charming; this is ravishing; there
is not a sound that does not go to the heart.” The pleasure of giving
this emotion to so many amiable persons moved me to tears; and these 1
could not restrain in the first duet, when I observed that I was not the
only person who wept. 89</p>
<p>That evening the Due d’Aumont sent him word to come to the palace the
next morning at eleven to be presented to the King; and the messenger
added that the King was expected to give the composer a pension. But
Rous- seau’s bladder vetoed the plan.</p>
<p>Will it be believed that the night of so brilliant a day was for me a
night of anguish and perplexity? My first thought was that after being
presented I should frequently want to retire; this had made me suffer
very considerably at the theater, and might torment me the next day,
when I should be in the gallery or in the King’s apartment, amongst all
the great, waiting for the de - parture of his Majesty. My infirmity was
the principal cause which prevented me from mixing in polite companies
and enjoying the conversation of the fair…. None but persons who are
acquainted with this situation can judge of the horror which being
exposed to the risk of it inspires. 90</p>
<p>So he sent word that he could not come. Two days later Diderot
reproved him for missing such a chance to provide more fitly for himself
and Therese. “He spoke of the pension with more warmth tha n, on such a
subject, I should have expected from a philosopher…. Although I was
obliged to him for his good wishes, I could not relish his maxims, which
produced a heated dispute, the first I ever had with him.” 91 He was not
without some profit from his Devin. Mme. de Pompadour liked it so well
that she herself played the part of Colette in its second presentation
at the court; she sent him fifty louis d’or, and Louis sent him a
hundred. 92 The King himself, “with the worst voice in his kingd om,”
went around singing Colette’s sad aria “J’ai perdu mon serviteur”— a
premonition of Gluck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rousseau prepared articles on music for the Encyclopedie.
“These I executed in great haste, and consequently very ill, in the
three months that D iderot had allowed me.” Rameau criticized these
contributions severely in a pamphlet, Erreurs stir la viusique dans
FEncyclopedie (1755). Rousseau amended the articles, and made them the
basis of a Dictionnaire de la musique (1767). His contemporaries,
excepting Rameau, rated him “a musician of the very first order”; 93 we
should now consider him as a good</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>composer in a minor genre; but he was without question the most
interesting writer on music in that generation.</p>
<p>When a troupe of Italian opera singers invaded Paris in 1752, a
contro- versy flared up on the relative merits of French versus Italian
music. Rous- seau leaped into the fray with a Lettre sur la vrusique
franpaise ( 1753), “in which,” said Grimm, “he proves that it is
impossible to compose music to French words; that the French language is
altogether unfit for music; that the French have never had music, and
never will.” 94 Rousseau was all for melody. “We sang some old song,” he
wrote in his Reveries, “which was far better than modern discord”; 95
what age has not heard that plaint? In the article “Opera” in his
Dictionnaire de la musique he gave a cue to Wagner: he defined opera as
“a dramatic and lyrical spec tacle which seeks to reunite all the charms
of the beaux arts in the representation of a passionate action…. The
constituents of an opera are the poem, the music, and the decora- tion:
the poetry speaks to the spirit, the music to the ear, the painting to
the eye…. Greek dramas could be called operas.” 96</p>
<p>About this time (1752) Maurice-Quentin de La Tour portrayed Rousseau
in pastel. 97 He caught Jean-Jacques smiling, handsome, and
well-groomed; Diderot condemned the portrait as unfair to the truth. 98
Marmontel de- scribed Rousseau as seen in these years at d’Holbach’s
dinners: “He had just gained the prize… at Dijon…. A timid politeness,
sometimes… so</p>
<p>obsequious as to border on humility. Through his fearful reserve
distrust was visible; his lowering eyes watched everything with a look
full of gloomy suspicion. He seldom entered into conversation, and
rarely opened himself to us.” 99</p>
<p>Having so forcefully denounced science and philosophy, Rousseau was
ill at ease among the philosophes who dominated the salons. His
Discourse had committed him to the defense of religion. Mme. d’Lpinay
tells how, at a dinner given by Mme. Quinault, the hostess, finding the
talk too irreverent, begged her guests to “respect at least natural
religion.” “No more than any other,” retorted the Marquis de Saint -
Lambert, lately Voltaire’s rival for Mme. du Chatelet, and soon to be
Rousseau’s for Mme. d’Houdetot. Mme. d’fi pinay continues:</p>
<p>At this answer Rousseau became angry, and muttered something which
made the company laugh at him. “If,” he said, “it is cowardice to allow
anyone to speak ill of an absent friend, it is a crime to allow anyone
to speak ill of his God, who is present; and I believe in God,
Messieurs.”… Turning to Saint - Lambert I said, “You, Monsieur, who are
a poet, will agree with me that the existence of an eternal being, all
powerful and supremely intelligent, is the germ of the most beautif ul
enthusiasm.” “I confess,” he replied, “that it is beautiful to see this
God inclining his face to the earth,… but it is the germ of the follies
—” “Monsieur,” interrupted Rousseau, “if you say one word more I shall
leave the room.” In fact he had left his seat, and was seriously
meditating flight, when the Prince de was announced , 100</p>
<p>and everybody forgot the subject of the debate. If we may believe
Mme. d’fipinay’s Memoirs, Rousseau told her that these atheists well
deserved eternal hell. 101</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>In the preface to his comedy Narcisse — which was played by the
Comedie Frangaise on December 18, 1752 — Rousseau renewed his war on
civilization. “The taste for letters always announces in a pe ople the
commencement of a corruption which it very soon accelerates. This taste
arises in a nation only from two evil sources… : idleness, and the
desire for distinction.” 102 Nevertheless he continued till 1754 to
attend d’Holbach’s “synagogue” o f freethinkers. There one day
Marmontel, Grimm, Saint-Lambert, and others heard the Abbe Petit read a
tragedy that he had composed. They found it lamentable, but praised it
handsomely; the abbe had too much wine in him to perceive their irony,
and swelled with content. Rousseau, resenting the insincerity of his
friends, fell upon the abbe with a merciless tirade: “Your piece is
worthless;… all these gentlemen are mocking you; go away from here, and
return to be vicar in your village.” 103 D’Holbac h reproved Rous- seau
for his rudeness; Rousseau left in anger, and for a year he stayed
away.</p>
<p>His companions had destroyed his Catholicism, but not his faith in
the fundamentals of Christianity. His boyhood Protestantism came to the
surface again as his Catholicism subsided. He idealized the Geneva of
his youth, and thought that he would be more comfortable there than in a
Paris that irked his soul. If he returned to Geneva he would regain the
proud title of citizen, with the exclusive privileges that this implied.
In June, 1754, he took the coach to Chambery, found Mme. de Warens poor
and unhappy, opened his purse to her, and went on to Geneva. There he
was welcomed as a repentant prodigal son; he seems to have signed a
statement reaffirming the Calvinist creed; 104 the Genevan clergy
rejoiced in the reclamation of an Encyclopedist to their evangelical
faith. He was reinstated as a citizen, and thereafter proudly signed
himself “Jean - Jacques Rousseau, Citoyen.”</p>
<p>I was so impressed with the kindness shown me… by the [civic] council
and the [ecclesiastical] consistory, and by the great civility and
obliging be- havior of the magistrates, ministers, and citizens, that… I
did not think of going back to Paris except to break up housekeeping,
find a situation for Monsieur and Madame Levasseur, or provide for their
subsistence, and then return with Therese to Geneva, there to settle for
the rest of my days. 105</p>
<p>He could now appreciate more thoroughly than in his boyhood the
beauty of the lake and its shores. “I preserved a lively remembrance of…
the farther end of the lake, and of this, some years afterward, I gave a
description in La Nouvelle Helo’ise” The Swiss peasants entered into the
bucolic idyl he was to write in that novel: they owned their farms, were
free from poll tax and corvee, busied themselves with domestic crafts in
winter, and stood contentedly apart from the noise and strife of the
world. He had in mind the small city-states of Switzerland when he
described his political ideal in Le Contrat social.</p>
<p>In October, 1754, he left for Paris, promising to be back soon.
Voltaire arrived in Geneva two months after Rousseau’s departure, and
settled down at Les Delices. In Paris Jean-Jacques resumed his
friendship with Diderot and Grimm, but not as trustfully as before. When
he learned that Mme. d’Holbach had died, he wrote the Baron a tender
letter of condolence; the</p>
<p>28</p>

<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>wo men were reconciled, and Rousseau again sat at table with the
infidels. For three years more he was, to all appearances, one of the
philosophies; his new Calvinist creed sat lightly on his thoughts. He
was absorbed now in seeing through the press his second Discourse ,
which was to be more world- shaking than the first.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE CRIMES OF CIVILIZATION</li>
</ol>
<p>In November, 1753, the Dijon Academy announced another competition.
The new question was: “What is the origin of inequality among men, and
is it authorized by natural law?” “Struck with this great question,”
says Rousseau, “I was surprised that the Academy had dared to propose
it; but since it had shown the courage,… I immediately undertook the
discus- sion.” 106 He entitled his contribution Discours sur Vorigine et
les jondements de rinegalite parmi les homines. At Chambery on June 12,
1754, he dedicated this second Discourse “to the Republic of Geneva,”
and added an address to the “most honorable, magnificent, and Sovereign
Lords,” voicing some not - able opinions on politics:</p>
<p>In my researches after the best rules common sense can lay down for
the constitution of a government, I have been so struck at finding them
all in actu- ality in your own, that even had I not been born within
your walls I should have thought it indispensable for me to offer this
picture of human society to that people which of all others seems to be
possessed of its greatest advantages, and to have best guarded against
its abuses. 107</p>
<p>He complimented Geneva in terms quite applicable to Switzerland
today:</p>
<p>A country diverted, by a fortunate lack of power, from the brutal
love of conquest, and secured, by a still more fortunate situation, from
the fear of be- coming itself the conquest of other states: a free city
situated between several nations, none of which should have any interest
in attacking it, while each had an interest in preventing it from being
attacked by the others. 108</p>
<p>And the future idol of the French Revolution approved the limitations
placed upon democracy in Geneva, where only eight per cent of the
popula- tion could vote:</p>
<p>In order to prevent self-interest and ill-conceived projects, and all
such dan- gerous innovations as finally ruined the Athenians, each man
should not be at liberty to propose new laws at pleasure; this right
should belong exclusively to the magistrates…. It is above all the great
antiquity of the laws which makes them sacred and venerable; men soon
learn to despise laws which they see daily altered; and states, by
accustoming themselves to neglect their ancient cus- toms under the
pretext of improvement, often introduce greater evils than those they
endeavor to remove. 109</p>
<p>Was this only a plea for readmission to Genevan citizenship?</p>
<p>This aim having been achieved, Rousseau submitted his essay to the
Dijon Academy. He was not awarded the prize, but when, in June, 1755, he
pub- lished the Discours , he had the satisfaction of becoming again the
exciting</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>*9</p>
<p>opic of Paris salons. He had left no paradox unturned to stir debate.
He did not deny “natural” or biological inequality; he recognized that
some indi - viduals are by birth healthier or stronger than others in
body or character or mind. But he argued that all other inequalities —
economic, political, social, moral — are unnatural, and arose when men
left the “state of nature,” estab - lished private property, and set up
states to protect property and privilege. “Man is naturally good”; 110
he becomes bad chiefly through social institu - tions that restrain or
corrupt his tendencies to natural behavior. Rousseau pictured an ideal
primitive condition in which most men were strong of limb, fleet of
foot, clear of eye,* and lived a life of action in which thought was
always a tool and incident of action, and not an enfeebling substitute
for it. He contrasted this natural health with the proliferating
diseases en- gendered in civilization by wealth and sedentary
occupations.</p>
<p>The greater part of our ills are of our own making, and we might have
avoided them, nearly all, by adhering to that simple, uniform, and
solitary manner of life which nature prescribed. If she destined man to
be healthy, I venture to declare that a state of reflection is a state
contrary to nature, and that a thinking man is a depraved animal
[Phonmie qui viedite est un animal deprave ]. When we think of the good
constitution of the savages — at least of those whom we have not ruined
with our spirituous liquors — and reflect that they are troubled with
hardly any disorders save wounds and old age, we are tempted to believe
that in following the history of civil society we shall be telling that
of human sickness. 112</p>
<p>Rousseau admitted that his ideal “state of nature… perhaps never ex -
isted, and probably never will”; 113 he offered it not as a fact of
history but as a standard of comparison. This is what he meant by the
startling proposal: “Let us begin, then, by laying facts aside, as they
do not affect the question. The investigations we may enter into… must
not be treated as historical truths, but only as conditional and
hypothetical reasonings.” 114 However, we</p>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought
himself of saying, This is mine , and found people simple enough to
believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many
crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes, might
not anyone have saved man- kind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up
the ditch, and crying to his fellows: “Beware of listening to this
impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth
belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.” 118</p>
<p>From that permitted usurpation came the curses of civilization: class
divi- sions, slavery, serfdom, envy, robbery, war, legal injustice,
political cor- ruption, commercial chicanery, inventions, science,
literature, art, “progress” — in one word, degeneration. To protect
private property, force was organ- ized, and became the state; to
facilitate government, law was developed to habituate the weak to submit
to the strong with a minimum of force and ex- pense. 119 Hence it came
about that “the privileged few gorge themselves with superfl uities,
while the starving multitude lack the bare necessaries of life.” 120
Added to these basic inequities is a mass of derivative iniquities:
“shameful methods sometimes practiced to prevent the birth of human
beings,” abor - tion, infanticide, castr ation, perversions, “the
exposure or murder of multi - tudes of infants who fall victims to the
poverty of their parents.” 121 All these</p>
<p>Should we therefore go back to savagery? “Must societies be totally
abolished? Must mine and thine be annulled, and must we return to the
for- ests to live among bears?” That is no longer possible for us; the
poison of civilization is in our blood, and we shall not eradicate it by
flight to the woods. To end private property, government, and law would
be to plunge the people into a chaos worse than civilization. “Once man
has left it he can never return to the time of innocence and equality.”
122 Revolution may be justified, for force may justly overthrow what
force has set up and main- tained ; 123 but revolution is not now
advisable. The best we can do is to study the Gospels again, and try to
cleanse our evil impulses by practicing the ethics of Christianity. 124
We can make a natural sympathy for our fellow men the basis of morality
and social order. We can resolve to live a less com- plicated life,
content with necessaries, scorning luxuries, shunning the race and fever
of “progress.” We can slough off, one by one, the artificialities,
hypocrisies, ana corruptions of civilization, and remold ourselves to
honesty, naturalness, and sincerity. We can leave the noise and riot of
our cities, their hatreds, licentiousness, and crimes, and go to live in
rural simplicity and domestic duties and content. We can abandon the
pretensions and blind alleys of philosophy, and return to a religious
faith that will uphold us in the face of suffering and death.</p>
<p>Today, having heard all this a hundred times, we sense a certain
artificial- ity in this righteous indignation. We are not sure that the
evils Rousseau described arise from corrupt institutions rather than
from the nature of man;</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>3 1</p>
<p>after all, it is human nature that made the institutions. When Jean-
Jacques wrote his second Discourse the idealization of the “friendly and
flowing savage” had reached its peak. In 1640 Walter Hamond had
published a pamphlet “proving that the inhabitants of Madagascar are the
happiest peo - ple in the world.” 125 Jesuit account s of Huron and
Iroquois Indians seemed to bear out Defoe’s picture of Robinson Crusoe’s
amiable man Friday. Vol - taire generally laughed at the legend of the
noble savage, but he used it gaily in U Ingenu. Diderot played with it
in the Supplement au Voyage de Bou- gainville. But Helvetius ridiculed
Rousseau’s idealization of the savage, 126 and Duclos, though a faithful
friend of Jean- Jacques, argued that “it is among savages that crime is
most frequent; the childhood of a nation is not its age of in nocence.”
127 All in all, the intellectual climate favored Rousseau’s thesis.</p>
<p>The victims of Rousseau’s invective calmed their consciences by repre
- senting the Discourse , like its predecessor, as a pose. Mme. du
Deffand openly called him a charlatan. 128 Skeptics laughed at his
professions of Chris- tian orthodoxy, at his literal interpretation of
Genesis. 129 The philosophes began to distrust him as upsetting their
schemes to win the government to their ideas of social reform; they were
not in favor of appealing to the re- sentments of the poor; they
recognized the reality of exploitation, but they saw no constructive
principle in the replacement of magistrates with mobs. The government
itself made no protest agains t Rousseau’s denunciations; probably the
court took the essay as an exercise in declamation. Rousseau was proud
of his eloquence; he sent a copy of the Discourse to Voltaire, and
anxiously awaited a word of praise. Voltaire’s reply is one of the gems
of French literature, wisdom, and manners:</p>
<p>I have received, Monsieur, your new book against the human race. I
thank you for it. You will please men, to whom you tell truths that
concern them, but you will not correct them. You paint in very true
colors the horrors of human society;… no one has ever employed so much
intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is
seized with a desire to walk on four paws [ marcher a quatre panes ].
However, as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit, I feel,
unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to re- sume it….</p>
<p>I agree with you that literature and the sciences have sometimes been
the cause of much evil…. [But] admit that neither Cicero, nor Varro, nor
Lucretius, nor Virgil, nor Horace had the least share in the
proscriptions of Marius, Sulla, Antony, Lepidus, Octavius…. Confess that
Petrarch and Boccaccio did not cause the intestine troubles of Italy,
that the badinage of Marot did not cause the Massacre o f
St. Bartholomew, and that Corneille’s Le Cid did not produce the wars of
the Fronde. The great crimes were com- mitted by celebrated but ignorant
men. That which has made, and will always make, this world a vale of
tears is the insatiable cupidity and indomitable pride of men….
Literature nourishes the soul, corrects it, consoles it; it makes your
glory at the same time that you write against it….</p>
<p>M. Chapuis informs me that your health is quite bad. You must come
and restore it in your native air, to enjoy freedom, to drink with me
the milk of our cows, and browse on our herbs. I am, very
philosophically and with the tenderest esteem, Monsieur, your very
humble and very obedient servant. 130</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Rousseau replied with equal courtesy, and promised to visit Les
Delices when he returned to Switzerland. 131 But he was deeply
disappointed by the reception of his Discourse in the Geneva to which he
had dedicated it with such ingratiating praise. Apparently the tight
little oligarchy that ruled the republic felt some of the barbs of that
essay, and did not relish Rousseau’s wholesale condemnation of property,
government, and law. “I d id not per- ceive that a single Genevan was
pleased with the hearty zeal found in the work.” 132 He decided that the
time was not ripe for his return to Geneva.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE CONSERVATIVE</li>
</ol>
<p>The same year 1755 that witnessed the publication of the second
Discourse saw the appearance, in Volume V of the Encyclopedic, of a long
article by Rousseau — “Discours sur l’economie politique.” It requires
note because it diverged from the earlier discourses in some vital
particulars. Here society, government, and law are honored as natural
results of man’s nature and needs, and private property is described as
a social boon and a basic right. “It is certain that the right of
property is the most sac red of all the rights of citizenship, and even
more important in some respects than liberty itself…. Property is the
true foundation of civil society, and the real guarantee of the
undertakings of citizens”; 133 i.e., men will not work beyond the p ro-
vision of their simplest needs unless they may keep the surplus product
as their own, to consume or transmit as they may desire. Now Rousseau
ap- proves the bequest of property from parents to children, and
cheerfully accepts the class divisions th at result. “Nothing is more
fatal to morality and the republic than the continual shifting of rank
and fortune among the citi- zens; such changes are both the proof and
the source of a thousand disorders, and overturn and confound
everything.” 134</p>
<p>But he continues to inveigh against social injustice and the class
favoritism of the law. Just as the state should protect private property
and its lawful inheritance, so “the members of a society ought to
contribute from their property to the support of t he state.” A rigorous
tax ought to be laid upon all persons in graduated proportion to their
property and “the superfluity of their possessions.” 135 There should be
no tax on necessaries, but a heavy tax on luxuries. The state should
finance a national system of education. “If the children are brought up
in common [in national schools] in the bosom of equality, if they are
imbued with the laws of the state and the precepts of the general will,…
we cannot doubt that they will cherish one another mutually as
brothers,… to become in time defenders and fathers of the country of
which they will have been the children.” 136 Patriotism is better</p>
<p>As the two earlier discourses were overwhelmingly individualistic, so
the article on political economy is predominantly social-istic. Now for
the first time Rousseau announces his peculiar doctrine that there is in
every society a “general will” over and above the algebraic sum of the
wishes and dislikes</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>of its constituent individuals. The community, in Rousseau’s
developing philosophy, is a social organism with its own soul:</p>
<p>The body politic is also a moral being, possessed of a will; and this
general will, which tends always to the preservation and welfare of the
whole and of every part, is the source of the laws, and constitutes for
all the members of the state, in their relations to one another, the
rule of what is just or unjust. 138</p>
<p>Around this conception Rousseau builds the ethics and the politics
that will henceforth dominate his views of public affairs. The rebel who
thought of virtue as the expression of the fr ee and natural man now
defines it as “noth - ing more than the conformity of particular wills
with the general will”; 139 and he who so recently saw law as one of the
sins of civilization, as a con- venient tool for keeping exploited
masses in docile order, now declares that “it is to law alone that men
owe justice and liberty; it is that salutary organ of the will of all
which establishes, in civil right, the natural equality between men; it
is the celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of
public reason.” 140</p>
<p>Perhaps the harassed editors of the Encyclopedic had cautioned
Rousseau to moderate, in this article, his attack upon civilization.
Seven years later, in The Social Contract, we shall find him defending
the community against the individual, and building his political
philosophy upon the notion of a sacred and supreme general will.
Meanwhile, however, he continued to be an individualist and a rebel,
hating Paris, asserting himself against his friends, and making fresh
enemies every day.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>ESCAPE FROM PARIS: 1 756</li>
</ol>
<p>His closest friends now were Grimm, Diderot, and Mme. d’fipinay.</p>
<p>Grimm was born at Ratisbon in 1723, and was therefore eleven years
younger than Rousseau. He was educated at Leipzig in the closing decade
of Bach’s life, and received from Johann August Ernesti a solid
grounding in the languages and literature of ancient Greece and Rome.
Coming to Paris in 1749, he learned French with German thoroughness, and
was soon writ- ing articles for Le Mercure. In 1750 he became private
secretary to Count von Friesen. His love of music attached him to
Rousseau, while a deeper hunger brought him to the feet of Mile. Fel, a
singer at the opera. When she preferred M. Cahusac, Grimm, says
Rousseau,</p>
<p>ook this so much to heart that the appearances of his affliction
became tragical…. He passed days and nights in a continued lethargy. He
lay with his eyes open,… without speaking, eating, or stirring…. The
Abbe Raynal and I watched over him; the Abbe, more robust than I, and in
better health than I was, by night, and I by day, without ever both
being absent at one time. 141</p>
<p>Von Friesen summoned a doctor, who refused to prescribe anything
except time. “At length, one morning, Grimm rose, dressed himself, and
returned to his regular way of life, without either then or later
mentioning… this irregular lethargy.” 142</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>Rousseau introduced Grimm to Diderot, and the three dreamed of going
to Italy together. Grimm absorbed avidly the stream of ideas spouting
from the cornucopia of Diderot’s mind; he learned the language of the
irreverent philosophes, wrote an agnostic Catechisme pom les enfants,
and advised von Friesen to take three mistresses at one time “in memory
of the Holy Trinity.” 143 Rousseau was irked by the growing intimacy
between Grimm, whom Sainte- Beuve was to call “the most French of
Germans,” and Diderot , “the most German of Frenchmen.” 144 “Grimm,”
Jean -Jacques complained, “you neglect me, and I forgive you for it.”
Grimm took him at his word. “He said I was right,… and shook off all
restraint; so that I saw no more of him except in company with our
common friends.” 145</p>
<p>In 1747 the Abbe Raynal had begun to send to French and foreign sub-
scribers a fortnightly newsletter, Nouvelles litteraires, reporting
events in the French world of letters, science, philosophy, and art. In
1753 he turned the enterprise over to Grimm, who, with help from Diderot
and others, carried it on till 1790. Under Grimm the letters had many
distinguished sub- scribers, including Queen Louisa Ulrika of Sweden,
former King Stanislas Leszczynski of Poland, Catherine II of Russia, the
Princess of Saxe-Gotha, the Prince and Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt, the
Duchess of Saxe-Coburg, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Duke Karl August of
Saxe-Weimar. Frederick the Great held back for a time, having several
correspondents in France; finally he consented to receive the letters,
but he never paid. Grimm’s first number (May, 1753) announced his
plan:</p>
<p>In the sheets which are requested of us we shall not spend time over
the brochures with which Paris is daily inundated;… rather we shall seek
to give an exact account, a logical analysis ( critique raisonnee) of
the books which deserve to hold the attention of the public. The drama,
which constitutes so brilliant a part of French literature, will be a
considerable part of our report. In general we shall let nothing escape
us which is worthy of the curiosity of other peoples. 148</p>
<p>This famous Correspondance litteraire is now a chief and precious
record for the intellectual history of France in the second half of the
eighteenth century. Grimm could be forthright in his critiques, since
these were not known to the French public or to the author discussed. He
was usually fair, except, later, to Rousseau. He made many judicious
judgments, but mis- judged Candide as “unable to bear serious
criticism”; this, however, was without prejudice, for he described
Voltaire as “the most fascinating, the most agreeable, and the most
famous man in Europe.” 147 Voltaire returned</p>
<p>It seems to me that the eighteenth century has surpassed all others
in the eulogiums that it has heaped upon itself…. A little more, and the
best minds</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>will persuade themselves that the mild and peaceful empire of
philosophy is about to succeed the long tempests of unreason, and to
establish forever the repose, the tranquillity, and the happiness of
mankind…. But unluckily the true philosopher has less consoling but more
accurate notions…. I am a long way from believing that we are
approaching the age of reason, and I lack but little of believing that
Europe is threatened by some fatal revolution. 150</p>
<p>We catch here a hint of the pride and vanity that sometimes irritated
Grimm’s friends. More Gallic than the Gauls, he spent hours on grooming
himself, powdering his face and hair, and so sprinkling himself with
per- fume that he was nicknamed “the musk bear.” 151 His Correspondance
shows him scattering compliments with expectant hand. Frederick the
Great made it a condition of subscribing to the letters that Grimm
should “spare me his compliments.” 152 Such flattery, of course, was
part of epistolary style in the Old Regime.</p>
<p>Grimm, usually cold and calculating, caught the attention of Paris by
almost dying for Mile. Fel, and fighting a duel for Mme. d’Fpinay.
Louise - Florence Tardieu d’Esclavelles was the daughter of a
Valenciennes baron who died in the King’s service in 1737. Eight years
later Louise, aged twenty, married Denis-Joseph Lalive d’fipinay, son of
a rich tax collector. They came to live in the handsome Chateau de la
Chevrette, nine miles from Paris, near the Forest of Montmorency. Her
happiness bubbled. “Will my heart ever be able to endure such
happiness?” she wondered. She wr ote to a cousin: “He was playing the
harpsichord, I was sitting on the arm of his chair, my left hand resting
on his shoulder, and my other hand turning over the leaves; he never
missed kissing it each time it passed in front of his lips.” 153</p>
<p>She was not beautiful, but she was charmingly petite, tres bien faite
(she tells us); 154 and her big black eyes would later ravish Voltaire.
But “always to feel the same thing” is soon “the same as to feel
nothing”; 155 after a year</p>
<p>All her friends agreed that she should take a lover. One came (1746),
that same Dupin de Francueil who gave employment to Rousseau. He began
with music, and ended with syphilis; he was soon cured, while she
continued to suffer. 156 He joined her husband in sharing the
Desmoiselles de Verrieres. Duclos told her bluntly, “Francueil and your
husband have the two sisters between them.” 157 She f ell into a
delirium that lasted thirty hours. Duclos sought to take Dupin’s place,
bur she sent him away. To these misfortunes</p>
<p>36 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. I</p>
<p>another was added. Mme. de Julli, dying, had given Louise a batch of
papers revealing her amours, with an earnest request to burn them.
Louise did. Then M. de Julli accused her of having knowingly burned the
certificates of her own indebtedness to him. She denied the charge, but
appearances were against her, for it was known that despite separation
she was giving her hus- band financial help.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Grimm entered the drama. He had been in-
troduced to Louise by Rousseau in 1751; the three had several times
played or sung music together. One evening at a party given by Count von
Friesen, a guest expressed conviction of Mme. d’fipinay’s guilt. Grimm
defended her; argument rose to the point of honor; accuser and defender
fought a duel; Grimm was slightly wounded. Soon afterward the lost
documents were found; Madame was exonerated; she thanked Grimm as her
preux chevalier , and their mutual esteem ripened into one of the most
enduring loves of that fitful age. When Baron d’Holbach sickened with
grief over the death of his wife, and Grimm went off to take care of him
in the countryside, Louise asked him: “But who will be my knight,
monsieur, if I am attacked in your absence?” Grimm answered: “The same
as before— your past life.” 158 The reply was not beyond cavil, but it
was beyond praise.</p>
<p>Rousseau had met Mme. d’fipinay in 1748 at Mme. Dupin’s. She invited
him to La Chevrette. Her Memoirs describe him fairly:</p>
<p>He pays compliments, yet he is not polite, or at least he is without
the air of politeness. He seems to be ignorant of the usages of society,
but it is easily seen that he is infinitely intelligent. He has a brown
complexion, white eyes that overflow with fire and give animation to his
expression…. They say he is in bad health, and endures agony which he
carefully conceals…. It is this, I fancy, which gives him from time to
time an air of sullenness. 159</p>
<p>His picture of her is not very gallant:</p>
<p>Her conversation, though agreeable enough in mixed company, was unin-
teresting in private…. I was happy to show her little attentions, and
gave her little fraternal kisses, which seemed not to be more sensual
than herself…. She was very thin, very pale, and had a bosom like the
back of her hand. This defect alone would have been sufficient to
moderate my most ardent desires. 160</p>
<p>For seven years he was welcomed in Mme. d’fipinay’s home. When she
saw how uncomfortable he was in Paris, she thought of ways to help him,
but she knew that he would refuse money. One day, as they were walking
through her park behind La Chevrette, she showed him a cottage, called
L’Hermitage, which had belonged to her husband. It was unused and in dis
- repair, but its situation, on the very edge of the Forest of
Montmorency, excited Rousseau to exclaim: “Ah, madame, what a delightful
habitation! This asylum was expressly prepared for me.” 161 Madame made
no reply, but when, in September, 1755, they walked again to the
cottage, Rousseau was surprised to find it repaired, the six rooms
furnished, and the grounds cleared and neat. He quotes her as saying:
“My dear, here behold your refuge; it is you who have chosen it;
friendship offers it to you. I hope this will remove your cruel idea of
separating from me.” She knew that he had thought of</p>
<p>CHAP, i)</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU WANDERER</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>residing in Switzerland; perhaps she did not know that his enthusiasm
for Geneva had cooled. He “bathed with tears the beneficent hand” of his
friend, but hesitated to accept her offer. She won Therese and Mme.
Levas- seur to her plan, and “at length she triumphed over all my
resolutions.”</p>
<p>On Easter Sunday, 1756, adding grace to her gift, she came to Paris
in her coach, and took her “bear,” as she called him, along with his
mistress and his mother-in-law, to the Hermitage. Therese did not relish
separation from Paris, but Rousseau, sniffing the air, was happier than
at any time since his idyl with Mme. de Warens. “On April 9, 1756, I
began to live.” 162 Grimm darkened the occasion with a warning to Adme.
d’f’pinay:</p>
<p>You do Rousseau a very ill service bv giving him the Hermitage, but
you do yourself a very much worse one. Solitude will complete the work
of black- ening his imagination; all his friends will be, in his eyes,
unjust and ungrateful, and you first of all, if you refuse a single time
to place yourself at his orders. 163</p>
<p>Then Grimm, now secretary to Marechal d’Estrees, went off to play his
part in the war that was to remake the map of the world.</p>
