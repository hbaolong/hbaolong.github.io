<h4 id="chapter-ix-mantua">CHAPTER IX Mantua</h4>
<p>1378-15 4°</p>
<p>I. VITTORINO DA FELTRE</p>
<p>M ANTUA was fortunate: throughout the Renaissance it had but one
ruling family, and was spared the turmoil of revolutions, court</p>
<p>murders, and coups d’etat. When Luigi Gonzaga became capitano del
popolo (1328) the ascendancy of his house was so well established that
he could occasionally leave his capital and hire himself out to other
cities as general — a custom followed by his successors through several
generations. His great-great-grandson Gianfrancesco I was raised to the
dignity of marquis (1432) by their theoretical sovereign the Emperor
Sigismund, and this title became hereditary in the Gonzaga family until
it was exchanged for the still loftier title of duke (1530). Gian was a
good ruler. He</p>
<p>drained marshes, promoted agriculture and industry, supported art,
and brought to Mantua, to tutor his children, one of the noblest figures
in the history of education.</p>
<p>Vittorino took his surname from his native town of Feltre, in
northeast Italy. Catching the itch for classical erudition that swept
like an epidemic through the Italy of the fifteenth century, he went to
Padua and studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, and rhetoric under divers
masters; he paid one of them by serving as his domestic. After being
graduated from the uni- versity he opened a school for boys. He chose
his pupils by their talent and eagerness rather than by their pedigree
or funds; he made the richer students pay according to their means, and
charged the poor students noth- ing. He tolerated no idlers, exacted
hard work, and maintained strict discipline. As this proved difficult in
the roistering atmosphere of a uni- versity town, Vittorino transferred
his school to Venice (1423). In 1425 he accepted the invitation of
Gianfrancesco to come to Mantua and teach a selected group of boys and
girls. These included four sons and a</p>
<p>daughter of the Marquis, a daughter of Francesco Sforza, and some
other scions of Italian ruling families.</p>
<p>The Marquis provided for the school a villa known as Casa Zojosa,
or</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. I</p>
<p>XJoyous House. Vittorino turned it into a semimonastic establishment,
in which he and his students lived simply, ate sensibly, and devoted
them- selves to the classic ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Vittorino himself was an athlete as well as a scholar, an expert fencer
and horseman, so at home in weather that he wore similar clothing winter
and summer, and walked in nothing but sandals in the severest cold.
Inclined to sensu- ality and anger, he controlled his flesh by periodic
fasting and by flogging himself every day; his contemporaries believed
that he remained a virgin till his death.</p>
<p>To chasten the instincts and form sound character in his pupils, he
first of all required of them a regularity of religious devotions, and
instilled in them a strong religious feeling. He sternly rebuked all
profanity, obscen- ity, or vulgarity of language, punished any lapse
into angry dispute, and made lying almost a capital crime. However, he
did not have to be told, as Lorenzo’s wife warned Politian, that he was
educating princes who might some day face the tasks of administration or
war. To make their bodies healthy and strong he trained them in
gymnastics of many kinds, in running, riding, leaping, wrestling,
fencing, and military exercises; he ac- customed them to bear hardships
without injury or complaint; though medieval in his ethics, he rejected
the medieval scorn of the body, and recognized with the Greeks the role
of physical health in the rounded excellence of man. And as he formed
the bodies of his pupils with athletics and toil, and their characters
with religion and discipline, so he trained their taste with instruction
in painting and music, and their minds with mathematics, Latin, Greek,
and the ancient classics; he hoped to unite in his pupils the virtues of
Christian conduct with the sharp clarity of the pagan intellect and the
esthetic sensitivity of Renaissance men. The Renaissance ideal of the
complete man — Vuomo universale — health of body, strength of character,
wealth of mind — reached its first formulation in Vittorino da
Feltre.</p>
<p>The fame of his methods spread through Italy and beyond. Many visi-
tors came to Mantua to see not its Marquis but its pedagogue. Fathers
begged from Gianfrancesco the privilege of enrolling their sons in this
“School of Princes.” He agre ed, and such later notables as Federigo of
Urbino, Francesco da Castiglione, and Taddeo Manfredi came amder-Vft^
torino’s formative hand. The most promising students enjoyed the
master’s personal attention; they lodged with him under his own roof,
and received the priceless instruction of daily contact with integrity
and intelligence. Vittorino insisted that poor but qualified applicants
should also be admit-</p>

<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ed; he persuaded the Marquis to provide funds, facilities, and
assistant teachers for the education and maintenance of sixty poor
scholars at a time; and when such funds did not suffice, Vittorino made
up the dif- ference out of his modest means. When he died (1446) it was
found that he had not left enough to pay for his funeral.</p>
<p>Lodovico Gonzaga, who succeeded Gianfrancesco as marquis of Mantua
(1444), was a credit to his teacher. When Vittorino took him in hand
Lodovico was a lad of eleven years, fat and indolent. Vittorino taught
him to control his appetite and to make himself fit for all the tasks of
govern- ment. Lodovico performed these duties well, and left his state
flourishing at his death. Like a true Renaissance prince, he used part
of his wealth to nourish literature and art. He collected an excellent
library, largely of Latin classics; he employed miniaturists to
illuminate the Aeneid and The Divine Comedy; he established the first
printing press in Mantua. Politian, Pico della Mirandola, Filelfo,
Guarino da Verona, Platina were among the humanists who at one time or
another accepted his bounty and lived at his court. 1 At his invitation
Leon Battista Alberti came from Florence and designed the Incoronata
Chapel in the cathedral, and the churches of Sant’ Andrea and San
Sebastiano. Donatello came too, and made a bronze bust of Lodovico. And
in 1460 the Marquis brought into his service one of the greatest artists
of the Renaissance.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ANDREA MANTEGNA: 1431-1506</li>
</ol>
<p>He was born at Isola di Cartura, near Padua, thirteen years before
Bot- ticelli; we must here retrace our steps in time if we are to
appreciate Mantegna’s achievement. He was enrolled in the painters’
guild in Padua when he was but ten years old. Francesco Squarcione was
then the most famous teacher of painting not only in Padua but in Italy.
Andrea entered his school, and progressed so rapidly that Squarcione
took him into his home and adopted him as a son. Inspired by the
humanists, Squarcione collected into his studio all the significant
remains of classic sculpture and architecture that he could appropriate
and transport, and bade his students copy them over and over again as
models of strong, restrained, and har- monious design. Mantegna obeyed
with enthusiasm; he fell in love with Roman antiquity, idealized its
heroes, and so admired its art that half his pictures have Roman
architectural backgrounds, and half his figures, of whatever nation or
time, bear a Roman stamp and garb. His art profited</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p><em>5</em></p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xand suffered through this youthful infatuation; he learned from
these exemplars a majestic dignity and a stem purity of design, but he
never fully emancipated his painting from the petrified calm of
sculptural forms. When Donatello came to Padua Mantegna, still a lad of
twelve, felt again the influence of sculpture, together with a powerful
impulse toward real- ism. At the same time he was fascinated by the new
science of perspective, so recently developed in Florence by Masolino,
Uccello, and Masaccio; Andrea studied all its rules, and shocked his
contemporaries with fore- shortenings ungracious in their truth.</p>
<p>In 1448 Squarcione received a commission to paint frescoes in the
church of the Eremitani friars at Padua. He assigned the work to two
favorite pupils: Niccolo Pizzolo and Mantegna. Niccolo finished one
panel in ex- cellent style, then lost his life in a brawl. Andrea, now
seventeen, con- tinued the work, and the eight panels that he painted in
the next seven years made him a name from one end of Italy to the other.
The themes were medieval, the treatment was revolutionary: the
backgrounds of classi- cal architecture were carefully detailed, the
virile physique and gleaming armor of Roman soldiers were mingled with
the somber features of Chris- tian saints; paganism and Christianity
were more vividly integrated in these frescoes than in all the pages of
the humanists. Drawing reached here a new accuracy and grace;
perspective appeared in painstaking perfection. Rarely had painting seen
a figure as splendid in form and bearing as that of the soldier guarding
the saint before the Roman judge; or anything so grimly realistic as the
executioner raising his club to beat out the martyr’s brains. Artists
came from distant cities to study the technique of the amazing Paduan
youth. — All but two of these frescoes were destroyed in the Second
World War.</p>
<p>Iacopo Bellini, himself a painter of renown, and already (in 1454)
father of painters fated to eclipse his fame, saw these panels in the
making, took a fancy to Andrea, and offered him his daughter in
marriage. Mantegna accepted. Squarcione opposed the union, and punished
Mantegna’s flight from his adoptive home by condemning the Eremitani
frescoes as stiff and pallid imitations of marble antiques. More
remarkable, the Bellinis suc- ceeded in conveying to Andrea a hint that
there was some truth in the charge. 2 Most remarkable, the hot-tempered
artist accepted the criticism, and profited from it by turning from the
study of statuary to the intent observation of life in all its actuality
and details. In the last two panels of the Eremitani series he included
ten portraits of contemporaries; and one, squat and fat, was
Squarcione.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) MANTUA 253</p>
<p>Canceling his contract with his teacher, Mantegna was now free to ac-
cept some of the invitations that besieged him. Lodovico Gonzaga offered
him a commission in Mantua (1456); Andrea held him off for four years,
and meanwhile, in Verona, he painted for the church of San Zeno a</p>
<p>polyptych that to this day makes that noble edifice a goal of
pilgrimage. In the central panel, amid a stately framework of Roman
columns, cornice, and pediment, the Virgin holds her Child, while angel
musicians and choristers envelop them; beneath this a powerful
Crucifixion shows Roman soldiers throwing dice for the garments of
Christ; and at the left the Garden of Olives presents a rugged landscape
that Leonardo may have studied for his Virgin of the Rocks. This
polyptych is one of the great paintings of the Renaissance.*</p>
<p>After three years in Verona Mantegna finally agreed to go to Mantua (
1460) ; and there, except for brief stays in Florence and Bologna, and
two years in Rome, he remained till his death. Lodovico gave him a home,
fuel, corn, and fifteen ducats (75) a month. Andrea adorned the palaces,
chapels, and villas of three successive marquises. The sole survivors in
Mantua of his labors there are the famous frescoes in the Ducal Palace,
specifically in the Sala degli Sposi — the Hall of the Betrothed — named
and decorated for the engagement of Lodo vico’s son Federigo to Margaret
of Bavaria. The subject was simply the ruling family — the Marquis, his
wife, his children, some courtiers, and Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga
welcomed by his father Lodovico o n the young prelate’s return from
Rome. Here was a gallery of remarkably realistic portraits, among them
Mantegna himself, looking older than his forty-three years, with lines
in his face and pouches under his eyes.</p>
<p>Lodovico too was aging rapidly, and his last years were dark with</p>
<p>roubles. Two of his daughters were deformed; wars consumed his reve-
nues; in 1478 plague so devastated Mantua that economic life almost
stopped, state revenues fell, and Mantegna’s salary was one of many that
went for a time unpaid. The artist wrote Lodovico a letter of reproach;
the Marquis answered with a gentle plea for patience. The plague passed;
Lodovico did not survive it. Under his son Federigo (1478-84) Mantegna
began, and under Federigo’s son Gianfrancesco ( 1484-1519) he com-
pleted, his finest work, The Triumph of Caesar. These nine pictures,</p>
<p>painted in tempera on canvas, were designed for the Corte Vecchia of

Garden of Olives and the Resurrection are in Tours, the Crucifixion is

<p>Ducal Palace; they were sold to Charles I of England by a needy duke
of Mantua, and are now in Hampton Court. The enormous frieze, eighty-
eight feet long, depicts a procession of soldiers, priests, captives,
slaves, musicians, beggars, elephants, bulls, standards, trophies, and
spoils, all escorting Caesar riding on a chariot and crowned by the
Goddess of Vic- tory. Here Mantegna returns to his first love, classic
Rome; again he paints like a sculptor; nevertheless his figures move
with life and action; the eye is drawn along, despite a hundred
picturesque details, to the culminating coronation; all the painter’s
artistry of composition, drawing, perspective, and meticulous
observation enters into the work, and makes it the master’s
masterpiece.</p>
<p>During the seven years that elapsed between the undertaking and the
completion of The Triumph of Caesar, Mantegna accepted a call from
Innocent VIII, and painted (1488-9) several frescoes that vanished in
the later vicissitudes of Rome. Complaining of the Pope’s parsimony—
while the Pope complained of his impatience — Mantegna returned to
Mantua, and rounded out his prolific career with a hundred pictures on
religious themes; he was forgetting Caesar and returning to Christ. The
most famous and disagreeable of these paintings is the Cristo morto
(Brera), the dead Christ lying on His back with His vast foreshortened
feet toward the spectator, and looking more like a sleeping condottiere
than like an ex- hausted god.</p>
<p>A final pagan picture came from Mantegna’s old age. In the Parnassus
of the Louvre he put aside his usual resolve to capture reality rather
than picture beauty; he surrendered himself for a moment to an unmoral
mythology, and portrayed a nude Venus throned on Parnassus beside her
soldier lover Mars, while at the mountain’s base Apollo and the Muses
celebrate her loveliness in dance and song. One of the Muses was
probably the Marquis Gianfrancesco’s wife, the peerless Isabella d’Este,
now the leading lady in the land.</p>
<p>It was Mantegna’s last great painting. His final years were saddened
by ill health, bad temp er, and mounting debts. He resented Isabella’s
pre - sumption to lay down the precise details of the pictures she asked
of him; he retired into an angry solitude, sold most of his art
collection, finally sold his house. In 1505 Isabella described him as
“tearful and agitated, and with so sunken a face that he seemed to me
more dead than alive.” 3 A year later</p>

<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE FIRST LADY OF THE WORLD</li>
</ol>
<p>La prima donna del mondo — so the poet Niccolo da Correggio called
Isabella d’Este. 4 The novelist Bandello considered her “supreme among
women”; 5 and Ariosto did not know which to praise most highly in “the
liberal and magnanimous Isabella”— her gracious beauty, her modesty, her
wisdom, or her fostering of letters and arts. She possessed most of the
ac- complishments and charms that made the educated woman of the Renais-
sance one of the masterpieces of history. She had a wide and varied
culture without being an “intellectual” o r ceasing to be an attractive
woman. She was not extraordinarily beautiful; what men admired in her
was her vitality, her high spirits, the keenness of her appreciation,
the perfection of her taste. She could ride all day and then dance all
night, and remain every moment a queen. She could rule Mantua with a
tact and good sense alien to her husband; and in the debility of his
later years she held his little state together despite his blunders, his
wanderings, and his syphilis. She corresponded on equal terms with the
most eminent personalities of her time. Popes and dukes sought her
friendship, and rulers came to her court. She subpoenaed nearly every
artist to work for her, she inspired poets to sing of her; Bembo,
Ariosto, and Bernardo Tasso dedicated works to her, though they knew
that her purse was small. She collected books and art with the judgment
of a scholar and the discrimination of a connoisseur. Wherever she went
she remained the cultural focus and sartorial exemplar of Italy.</p>
<p>She was one of the Estensi — the brilliant family that gave dukes to
Fer- rara, cardinals to the Church, and a duchess to Milan. Isabella,
born in 1474, was a year older than her sister Beatrice. Their father
was Ercole I of Ferrara, their mother was Eleonora of Aragon, daughter
of King Fer- rante I of Naples; they were well equipped with lineage.
While Beatrice was sent to Naples to learn vivacity at the court of her
grandfather, Isabella was brought up amid the scholars, poets,
dramatists, musicians, and artists that were making Ferrara for a time
the most brilliant of Italian capitals. At six she was an intellectual
prodigy who made diplomats gape; “though I had heard much of her
singular intelligence,” wrote Beltramino Cusatro to Marquis Federigo of
Mantua in 1480, “I could never have imagined such a thing to be
possible.” 6 Federigo thought she would be a good catch for his son
Francesco, and so proposed to her father. Ercole, needing the
support</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>2 56</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xof Mantua against Venice, agreed, and Isabella, aged six, found
herself engaged to a boy of fourteen. She remained for ten years more at
Ferrara, learning how to sew and sing, to write Italian poetry and Latin
prose, to play the clavichord and the lute, and to dance with a
sprightly grace that seemed to attest invisible wings. Her complexion
was clear and fair, her black eyes sparkled, her hair was a mesh of
gold. So, at sixteen, she left the haunts of her happy childhood, and
became, proudly and seriously, the Marchioness of Mantua.</p>
<p>Gianfrancesco was swarthy, bushy-haired, fond of hunting, impetuous
in war and love. In those early years he attended zealously to
government, and faithfully maintained Mantegna and several scholars at
his court. He fought with more courage than wisdom at Fornovo, and
chivalrously or prudently sent to Charles VIII most of the spoils that
he had captured in the tent of the fleeing King. He used the soldier’s
privilege of promiscuity, and began his infidelities with the first
confinement of his wife. Seven years after his marriage he allowed his
mistress Teodora to appear in almost regal raiment at a tournament in
Brescia, where he rode in the lists. Isabella may have been partly to
blame: she became a bit plump, and went on long visits to Ferrara,
Urbino, and Milan; but doubtless the Marquis was not inclined to
monogamy in any case. Isabella bore with his adventures patiently, took
no public notice of them, remained a good wife, gave her husband
excellent advice in politics, and supported his interests by her
diplomacy and her charm. But in 1 506 she wrote to him — then leading
papal troops — a few words warm with the hurt she felt: “No interpreter
is needed to make me aware that Your Excellency has loved me little for
some time past. Since this, however, is a disagreeable subject, I will…
say no more.” 7 Her de - votion to art, letters, and friendship was in
part an attempt to forget the bitter emptiness of her married life.</p>
<p>There is nothing more pleasant in all the rich diversity of the
Renaissance than the tender relations that bound together Isabella,
Beatrice, and Isa- bella’s sister -in-law Elisabetta Gonzaga; and few
passages finer in Renais- sance literature than the affectionate letters
they exchanged. Elisabetta was grave and weak, and often ill; Isabella
was merry, witty, brilliant, more interested in literature and art than
either Elisabetta or Beatrice; but these differences of character were
made complementary by good sense. Elisa- betta loved to come to Mantua,
and Isabella worried more about her sister- in- law’s health than about
her own, and took every measure to make her well. Yet there was a
selfishness in Isabella quite absent from Elizabeth. Isabella could ask
Caesar Borgia to give he r Michelangelo’s Cupid, which</p>
<p>MANTUA</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>Borgia had stolen after seizing Elisabetta’s Urbino. After the fall
of Lodo - vico il Moro, the brother-in-law who had lavished every
courtesy upon her, she went to Milan and danced at a ball given by
Lodovico’s conqueror, Louis XII; perhaps, however, it was her feminine
way of saving Mantua from the resentment aroused in Louis by the
injudicious candor of her husband. Her diplomacy accepted the interstate
amorality of that time and ours. Otherwise she was a good woman, and
there was hardly a man in Italy that would not have been glad to serve
her. Bembo wrote to her that he “desired to serve her and please her as
if she were pope.” 8</p>
<p>She spoke Latin better than any other woman of her time, but she
never mastered the language. When Aldus Adanutius began to print his
choice editions of the classics she was among his most enthusiastic
customers. She employed scholars to translate Plutarch and Philostratus,
and a learned Jew to translate the Psalms from the Hebrew so that she
might assure herself of their original magnificence. She collected
Christian classics too, and read the Fathers with courage. Probably she
treasured books more as a collector than as a reader or a student; she
respected Plato, but really preferred the chivalric romances that
entertained even the Ariostos of her generation and the Tassos of the
next. She loved finery and jewelry more than books and art; even in her
later years the women of Italy and France looked to her as the glass of
fashion and the queen of taste. It was part of her diplomacy to move
ambassadors and cardinals with the combined allure of her person, her
dress, her manners, and her mind; they thought they were admiring her
erudition or her wisdom when they were relishing her beauty, her
costume, or her grace. She was hardly profound, except perhaps in
statesmanship. Like practically all her contemporaries she listened to
astrologers, and timed her enterprises by the concurrence of the stars.
She amused herself with dwarfs, maintained them as part of her
entourage, and had six rooms and a chapel built to their measure for
them in the Castello. One of these favorites was so short (said a wit)
that if it had rained an inch more he would have been drowned. She was
fond, too, of dogs and cats, chose them with the finesse of a fancier,
and buried them with solemn funerals in which the surviving pets joined
with the ladies and gentlemen of the court.</p>
<p>The Castello — or Reggia, or Palazzo Ducale — over which she reigned
was a medley of buildings of various dates and authorship, but all in
that style of outer fortress and inner palace which raised similar
structures in Ferrara, Pavia, and Milan. Some components, like the
Palazzo del Capitano, went back to the Buonacolsi rulers in the
thirteenth century; the harmonious Castello San Giorgio was a creation
of the fourteenth; the Camera degli</p>

<p>XSposi was the work of Lodovico Gonzaga and Mantegna in the
fifteenth; many rooms were rebuilt in the seventeenth and eighteenth;
some, like the sumptuous Sala degli Specchi, or Hall of Mirrors, were
redecorated during the rule of Napoleon. All were elegantly fitted out;
and the vast congeries of residential chambers, reception halls, and
administrative offices looked out on courts, or gardens, or Virgil’s
meandering Mincio, or the lakes that</p>
<p>Next to her care for the preservation of Mantua’s independence and
prosperity, and sometimes above her friendships, the ruling passion of
her life was the collection of manuscripts, statues, paintings,
majolica, antique marbles, and little products of the goldsmit h’s art.
She used her friends, and employed special agents, in cities from Milan
to Rhodes, to bargain and buy for her, and to be on the alert for
“finds.” She haggled because the treasury of her modest state was too
narrow for her ideas. Her collection was small, but every item in it
stood high in its class. She had statuary by Michelangelo, paintings by
Mantegna, Perugino, Francia; not content, she importuned Leonardo da
Vinci and Giovanni Bellini for a picture, but they held her off as one
who paid more in praise than in cash, and doubtless, too, because she
specified too immutably what each picture should represent and contain.
In some cases, as when she paid 115 ducats (875) for Jan van Eyck’s
Passage of the Red Sea, she borrowed heavily to satisfy her eager- ness
for a masterpiece. She was not generous to Mantegna, but when that ogre
of a genius died she persuaded her husband to lure Lorenzo Costa to
Mantua with a handsome salary. Costa decorated Gianfrancesco Gonzaga’s
favorite retreat, the palace of St. Sebastian, made portraits of the
family, and painted a mediocre Madonna for the church of Sant’
Andrea.</p>
<p>In 1524 Giulio Pippi, called Romano, the greatest of Raphael’s
pupils, settled at Mantua, and astonished the court with his skill as
architect and painter. Almost the entire Ducal Palace was redecorated
according to his designs, and by the brushes of himself and his pupils —
Francesco Primatic- cio, Niccolo dell’ Abbate, and Michelangelo Anselmi.
Federigo, Isabella’s son, was ruler now; and since he, like Romano, had
acquired at Rome a taste for pagan subjects and decorative nudes, he had
the walls and ceilings of several rooms in the Castello painted with
inviting pictures of Aurora, Apollo, the Judgment of Paris, the Rape of
Helen, and other phases of</p>

<p>classic myth. In 152 5, on the outskirts of the town, Giulio began to
build his most famous work, the Palazzo del Te.* A vast rectangle of
one-storied structures, in a simple design of stone blocks and
Renaissance windows, surrounds what was once a pleasant garden but is
now a neglected waste in the impoverished aftermath of war. The interior
is a succession of sur- prises: rooms tastefully adorned with pilasters,
carved cornices, painted spandrels, and coffered vaults; walls,
ceilings, and lunettes picturing the story of the Titans and the
Olympians, Cupid and Psyche, Venus and Adonis and Mars, Zeus and
Olympia, all in a revel of splendid nudes, in the amorous and reckless
taste of the later Renaissance. To crown these masterpieces of sexual
license and gigantic strife, Primaticcio carved in stucco a grand
processional relief of Roman soldiers in the manner of Mantegna’s
Triumph of Caesar, and almost with the chiseled excellence of Ph eidias.
When Primaticcio and dell’ Abbate were summoned to Fon - tainebleau by
Francis I they brought to the royal palaces of France this style of
decoration — with rosy nudes — which Giulio Romano had brought to Mantua
from his work with Raphael in Rome. From the citadel of Christianity
pagan art radiated to the Christian world.</p>
<p>The last years of Isabella mingled sweet and bitter in her cup. She
helped her invalid husband to govern Mantua. Her diplomacy saved it from
fall- ing prey to Caesar Borgia, then to Louis XII, then to Francis I,
then to Charles V; one after another she humored, flattered, charmed,
when Gian- francesco or Federigo seemed on the edge of political
disaster. Federigo, who succeeded his father in 1519, was an able
general and ruler, but he allowed his mistress to displace his mother as
ruler of the Mantuan court. Perhaps retreating from this indignity,
Isabella went to Rome (1525) to seek a red hat for her son Ercole.
Clement VII was noncommittal, but the cardinals welcomed her, made her
suite in the Colonna Palace a salon, and kept her there so long that she
found herself imprisoned in the palace dur- ing the sack of Rome (1527).
She escaped with her usual adroitness, won the coveted cardinalate for
Ercole, and returned to Mantua in triumph.</p>
<p>In 1529, attractive at fifty-five, she went to the Congress of
Bologna, courted Emperor and Pope, helped the lords of Urbino and
Ferrara to keep their principalities from being absorbed into the Papal
States, and persuaded Charles V to make Federigo a duke. In that same
year Titian came to Mantua and painted a famous portrait of her; the
fate of this picture is uncertain, but the copy made of it by Rubens

<p>Xvigor and love of life. Benibo, visiting her eight years later, was
amazed by her vivacity, the alertness of her mind, the scope of her
interests. He called her “the wisest and most fortunate of women,” 8 but
her wisdom fell short of accepting old age cheerfully. She died in 1539,
aged sixty-four, and was buried with preceding rulers of Mantua in the
Capella dei Signori in the church of San Francesco. Her son ordered a
handsome tomb to be raised to her memory, and joined her in death a year
later. When the French pillaged Mantua in 1797 the tombs of the Mantuan
princes and princesses were shattered, and the ashes they contained were
mingled in the indis- criminate dust.</p>
