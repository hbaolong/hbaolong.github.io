<p>XAlma Mater Italia</p>
<p>1564 — 1648</p>
<p>I. THE MAGIC BOOT</p>
<p>A fter the double fury of Renaissance and Reformation, Italy was</p>
<p>L subsiding into a Spanish subjection harassed with poverty, solaced
with religion, and gilded with peace. The Treaty of Cateau-Cambr6sis
(1559) had awarded the duchy of Savoy to Emmanuel Philibert. Genoa,
Lucca, Venice, and San Marino survived as independent republics. Mantua
remained obedient to the Gonzaga dukes, Ferrara to the E^tensi, Parma to
the Farnese. The Medici ruled Tuscany — Florence, Pisa, Arezzo, Siena —
but their ports were under Spanish control. Through her viceroys Spain
governed the duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, which included
Sicily and all Italy south of the Papal States. These, running across
the center of the peninsula from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic, were
ruled by popes hemmed in by Spanish power.</p>
<p>That power was not militarily aggressive; it did not interfere in
the</p>
<p>internal affairs of the states, except Milan and Naples; but its
distaste for commerce and its fear of the free intellect cast a pall
over Italian life. The capture of Oriental and American trade by the
Atlantic nations</p>
<p>transferred to them the wealth that had once financed the Renaissance
and now nourished the cultural blooming of Spain, England, and the
Netherlands. Italy suffered further from the decline of papal revenues
consequent upon the Reformation. The patient peasantry toiled and
prayed, the innumerable monks prayed, the merchants lost caste and for-
tune, the aristocracy spent itself in the pursuit of titles and in
extravagant display.</p>
<p>And yet amid this political debacle Italy produced the greatest
scientist of the age, Galileo; the adventurous and prophetic philosophy
of Bruno; the greatest sculptor, Bernini; the most influential composer,
Monteverdi; the bravest missionaries; one of her greatest poets, Tasso;
and, in Bologna, Naples, and Rome, schools of painting rivaled only in
the opulent Nether- lands. Culturally Italy was still supreme.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XL In the Foothills of the Alps</p>
<p>It is pleasant to traverse again, if only with mind and pen and
haste, the garden and gallery called Italy. Turin became a major capital
under the able rule of Emmanuel Philibert and the encouragement given to
literature and art by his consort, Margaret of France and Savoy. Milan,
though subject, was still magnificent; Evelyn described it in 1643 as
“one of the most princely cities in Europe, with 100 churches, 71
monasteries, 40,000 inhabitants . . . sumptuous palaces, and rare
artists.”^ After a fir e gutted the Basilica of San Lorenzo Maggiore
(1573), Carlo Borromeo, the saintly Archbishop of Milan, commissioned
Martino Bassi to rebuild the interior in the stately Byzantine style of
San Vitale’s at Ravenna. Carlo’s nephew. Cardinal Federigo Borrom eo,
raised the Palazzo Ambrosiano (1609), and established in it the famous
Biblioteca Ambrosiana. The Palazzo di Brera, begun for a Jesuit college
in 1615, has been since 1776 the home of the Accademia di Belle Arti,
and since 1809 that of the renowned Brera Gallery, seriously injured in
the Second World War but now handsomely restored. There one may find
much of the work of the Procaccini and the Crespi, the two families that
dominated Milanese painting in this age.</p>
<p>Genoa, La Serenissima, still proudly surveyed, from her
palace-decorated hills, a Mediterranean dotted with Genoese ships. The
merchant republic had lost its Eastern possessions to the Turks, and
some of her trade with the Orient had passed to the Atlantic states; but
her great mole gave her so fine a harbor that she remained (and is) the
chief Italian port. Here the princes of com- merce or finance built some
of the richest homes in Italy. Evelyn thought that the Strada Nova, or
New Street, planned by Rubens and faced by palaces of polished marble,
was “far superior to any in Europe.”^ Galeazzo Alessi and his pupils
designed many of these lordly mansions, which were famous for their art
galleries, their stately stairways, their paneled or frescoed walls, and
their luxurious furniture — “whole tables and bedsteads of massive
silver”; the Genoese magnates were adepts at turning sweat into gold. In
1587 Giacomo della Porta raised the Basilica of the Santissima
Annunziata, whose fluted columns, perfect pulpit, and ornate vault were
the pride of Genoese piety. This and many another of Genoa’s churches
and palaces were largely ruined in the Second World War.</p>
<p>As late as Vasari, Florence was still termed the Athens of Italy, for
she was fertile in literature, scholarship, and science as well as art.
Everytliing prospered there except chastity. Under Grand Duke Francesco
I (1574-87) the great Medici family deteriorated into a mess of
intemperance and adultery. Cardinal Ferdinando de’ Medici resigne d his
ecclesiastical orders to become Grand Duke Ferdinand I; for twenty-two
years (1587-1609) he gave Tuscany a just and enlightened rule, he
expanded Tuscan commerce by making Livorno (Leghorn) a free port open to
all traders and faiths, and he restored the morals of his</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>people by the morality of his life. His successors Cosimo II and
Ferdinand II distinguished themselves by financing Galileo. Bartolommeo
Ammanati carved the great fountain of Neptune for the Piazza della
Signoria in Florence, and designed the Palazzo Ducale in Lucca. Giovanni
da Bologna finished in 1583 the Rape of the Sabines that stands in the
Loggia dei Lanzi, and cast the statue of Henry IV which Cosimo II
presented to Marie de Medicis to adorn the Pont Neuf in Paris.
Alessandro Allori and his son Cristofano continued, dimin- uendo, the
chromatic fantasy of Florentine painting, and Pietro da Cortona skirted
mastery in frescoes picturing, on the ceilings of the Pitti Palace, the
virtues of Duke Cosimo I.</p>
<p>Parma in this period had a renowned duke, Alessandro Farnese, who was
kept so busy leading Spanish armies in the Netherlands that he never
occupied his throne. Under his son Ranuccio the University of Parma
attained European fame, and Aleotti built (1618) the Teatro Farnese,
accommodating seven thousand spectators in a semicircular amphitheater
rivaled only, in modern Italy, by the Teatro Olimpico of his teacher,
Palladio.</p>
<p>Mantua now entered upon a period of prosperity recalling the great
days of Isabella d’Este. A flourishing textile industry made Mantuan
cloth popular even in rival England and France. The house of Gonzaga,
which had ruled the duchy since 1328, was still producing able men. Duke
Vincenzo I again incar- nated the qualities of a Renaissance prince:
handsome and gracious, patron of happy Rubens and miserable Tasso,
collector of ancient and Chinese art, of musical instruments, Flemish
tapestries, Dutch tulips, and beautiful women, lover of poetry and
gambling, brave in battle and bold in statesmanship, but wearing himself
out in adultery and war, and dying at fifty in 1612. Three sons ruled in
turn; the last, Vincenzo II, left no children, and the competition of
France, Austria, and Spain to determine and control his successor made
the duchy the helpless theater of a devastating War of the Mantuan
Succession (1628-31), which almost blotted Mantua from history.</p>
<p>Verona idled culturally through this epoch, resting on the
Renaissance. In Vicenza the classic fagades of Palladio were setting a
style for Christopher Wren. Vincenzo Scamozzi completed Palladio’s
Teatro Olimpico and de - signed the Palazzo Trissino-Barton. A flair for
ornament, hardly suppressed in Palladio, made Scamozzi a living bridge
from classicism to baroque.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Venice</li>

<p>The Queen of the Adriatic, like ancient Rome, had a long and stately
decline. She was losing to Portugal her sea trade with India and would
soon feel the competition of the Dutch. She bore the brunt of Turkish
maritime expansion; her navy and her commanders were major factors</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xin the victory over the Turks at Lepanto (1571), but she yielded
Cyprus a few months later, and thereafter her commerce with the eastern
Mediter- ranean was subject to Turkish permission and terms. She
struggled val- iantly to meet the challenge of change. By connecting at
Aleppo with caravans from Central Asia, she made up in some measure for
the lessen- ing of her seaborne trade with the East. Her vessels still
controlled the Adriatic. She shared in the profits of the slave trade
that was now dis- gracing Portugal, Spain, and England. Her mainland
dependencies — Vicenza, Verona, Trieste, Trent, Aquileia, Padua —
^prospered in economy and increased in population. Her industries
continued to excel in glass, silk, lace, and artistic luxuries. Her
Banco di Rialto, established in 1587 after the failure of many private
banks, put the strength of the state be- hind Venetian finance, and
served as a model for similar institutions in Nuremberg, Hamburg, and
Amsterdam. Travelers marveled at the beauty of her architecture and her
women, the cleanliness of her streets, and the tenacious stability of
her government.</p>
<p>Her foreign policy aimed to keep a balance of power between France
and Spain, lest one or the other absorb the weakened republic; hence her
early recognition of Henry IV to strengthen war-torn France. In 1616 the
Spanish viceroy at Naples, the Duke of Osuna, entered into a con-
spiracy with the Spanish ambassador at Venice to overthrow the Senate
and make the republic a dependency of Spain. Philip III, after the
delicate fashion of governments, gave the enterprise his blessing, but
bade Osuna proceed “without letting anyone know that you are doing it
with my knowledge, and make believe that you are acting without
orders.”® The Venetian Signory had the best spies in Europe; the plot
was detected, the local conspirators were seized, and one morning the
people were edified to see them hanging in St. Mark’s Square, gazing
with dead eyes upon happy doves.</p>
<p>This quiet and austere oligarchy, holding commerce with — and giving
religious freedom to — men of any creed, took a remarkably independent
attitude toward the papacy. It taxed the clergy, subjected them to the
civil law, and forbade, without its consent, the erection of new shrines
or monasteries and the deeding of land to the Church. A party of
Venetian statesmen, led by Leonardo Donato and Nicolo Contarini,
especially re- sisted the claims of the papacy to power in temporal
affairs. In 1605 Camillo Borghese became Pope Paul V; a year later
Donato was chosen doge; these two men, who had been friends when Donato
was Venetian envoy at Rome, now confronted each other in a struggle
between Church and state, echoing across five centuries the contest
between Gregory VII and the Emperor Henry IV. And Pope Paul was shocked
to find that</p>
<p>the intellectual leader of the anticlerical party in Venice was
another Paul, Fra Paolo Sarpi, a Servite monk.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>Sarpi, said Molmenti, was “the loftiest intellect that Venice ever
pro - duced.”* Son of a merchant , he entered the Servite order at
thirteen, absorbed knowledge passionately, and at eighteen defended 318
theses in a public disputation at Mantua, so successfully that its Duke
made him court theologian. At twenty-two he was ordained priest and
became a professor of philosophy; at twenty-seven he was elected
provincial of his order for the Venetian Republic. He continued his
studies in mathematics, astronomy, physics, everything. He discovered
the contractility of the iris. He wrote scientific treatises that are
now lost, and took part in the investigations and experiments of
Fabrizio d’Acquapendente and Giam - battista della Porta, who said that
he had never met a “more learned man, or one more subtle in the whole
circle of knowledge.”® Perhaps th ese profane studies injured Paolo’s
faith. He welcomed some Protestants to friendship, and charges were
lodged against him before the Venetian Inquisition — the same body that
was soon to capture Giordano Bruno. Thrice he was nominated to
bishoprics by the Senate; thrice the Vatican rejected him; and the
memory of these rebuffs accentuated his hostility to Rome.</p>
<p>In 1605 the Senate arrested two priests and convicted them of serious
crimes. Pope Paul V demanded that the men be turned over to
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and also ordered the repeal of the laws
against new churches, monasteries, and religious orders. The Venetian
Signory courteously refused. The Pope gave the Doge, the Signory, and
the Senate twenty- seven days within which to comply. They called in Fra
Paolo as coun- selor in canon law; Sarpi advised resistance on the
ground that papal power extended only to spiritual concerns; the Senate
adopted his view. In May 1606 the Pope excommunicated Donato and the
Signory and laid an interdict upon all religious services in Venetian
territory. The Doge in- structed the Venetian clergy to ignore the
interdict and continue their functions; they did, except the Jesuits,
the Theatines, and the Capuchins. The Jesuits, pledged by their
constitutions to obey the popes, left Venice in a body, despite the
Signory’s warning that if they left they would</p>
<p>never be allowed to return. Meanwhile Sarpi, answering Cardinal
Bellar- mine, published tracts limiting the papal power, and proclaiming
the superior authority of general councils over the popes.</p>
<p>Paul V appealed to Spain and France. But Spain had often rejected</p>
<p>papal edicts, and Henry IV of France was grateful to Venice. However,
Henry sent to Venice the judicious Cardinal de Joyeuse, who devised the
necessary face-saving formulas. The priests were released to the French
ambassador, who soon released them to Rome; the Senate refused to repeal
the protested laws, but (hoping for papal aid against the Turks) it</p>
<p>promised that the Republic would “conduct itself with its accustomed
piety.” The Pope suspended his censures, and Joyeuse absolved the ex
-</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xcommunicates. “The claims of Paul V,” says a Catholic historian,
“were too medieval in character to be made good.”® This was the last
time that an entire state was placed under an interdict.</p>
<p>On October 5, 1607, Sarpi was attacked by assassins, who left him for
dead. He recovered, and is said to have remarked, in an epigram almost
too good to be true, ^^Agnosco stilum curiae Romanae“ (I recognize the
pointed style of the Roman court) .*^ The assassins found protection and
acclaim in the Papal States.® Henceforth Sarpi lived quietly in his
cloister saying Mass every day; but his own stilus was not idle. In 1619
he pub- lished, under a pseudonym and through a London firm, his Istoria
del Concilio Tridentino, a voluminous indictment of the Council of
Trent. He gave a quite Protestant account of the Reformation, and
condemned the Council for making the schism irreconcilable by yielding
completely to the popes. The Protestant world hailed the book with
enthusiasm, and Milton called its author “the great unmasker.” The
Jesuits commissioned a learned scholar of their order, Sforza
Pallavicino, to write a counter- history (1656- 64), which exposed and
rivaled Sarpi’s bias and inaccu - racy.® Despite their parti pris, these
two books marked an advance in the collection and use of original
documents, and Sarpi’s vast brief has the added and dangerous attraction
of fiery eloquence. He was far ahead of his time in advocating a
complete separation of Church and state.</p>
<p>Under that proud government, on and between those placid and odor-
ous canals, Venice continued to pursue money and beauty, appeasing
Christ with architecture and the Virgin with litanies. Every week had
some festival, for which any saint provided excuse; we see such
collective raptures in the paintings of Guardi; and in the portraits we
note the sensuous. Oriental prodigality of costumes and jewelry. Almost
any</p>
<p>evening one could hear music coming from the gondolas. If you stepped
into such a magic bark and gave no directions, the gondolier would, with
no word spent, take you to the house of some associated courtesan. Mon-
taigne, who had as few prejudices as any man, was surprised at the abun-
dance and freedom of the Venetian filles de joie. They paid a tax to the
state, which in return allowed them to live where they liked and dress
as they pleased; and it defended them against defaulting
customers.^®</p>
<p>The Grand Canal and its tributaries grew fairer year by year with</p>
<p>lordly churches, gay new palaces, or a graceful bridge. In 1631 the
Senate commissioned Baldassare Longhena to build the noble Church of
Santa Maria della Salute as a votive offering to the Virgin for
restoring the health of the city after a great plague. In 1588-92
Antonio da Ponte re-</p>
<p>• Stihis meant originally a pointed iron; then an iron point used in
writing on wax tablets; then a pen; then a manner of writing, a style.
The Italian diminutive stiletto meant both an engraving tool and a small
dagger.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) ALMA MATER ITALIA 231</p>
<p>placed an old wooden bridge with a new Ponte di Rialto, spanning the
Grand Canal with a single marble arch ninety feet in length, flanked by
shops on either side. About 1 600 the Bridge of Sighs (the Ponte dei
Sospiri) was built high over a canal between the Palazzo dei Dogi and
the Prigioni di San Marco — “a palace and a prison on each hand.”“</p>
<p>Scamozzi completed Palladio’s Church of San Giorgio and Sansovino’s
Libreria Vecchia; Scamozzi and Longliena raised the Procuratie Nuove
(1582- 1640), adjoining St. Mark’s Square, as new offices for the
Venetian</p>
<p>Only one Venetian sculptor, Alessandro Vittoria, stands out in
this</p>
<p>period, but Venetian painting produced two men of the second rank.
Across the generations Palma Vecchio (d. 1528) handed the colors to his
grandnephew Palma Giovane — i.e., Jacopo Palma the Younger — who died
just a hundred years later. Giovane is put down as a decadent because he
painted with careless haste, but some of his pictures, like the Pope
Anaclytus in the Church of the Crociferi, come close to greatness; and
in some lines of Molmenti’s this carele^ Younger leaps to life:</p>
<p>Palma il Giovane had no other object . . . than his work, from
which</p>
<p>the profoundest grief was powerless to distract him. In his art he
sought consolation for the death of his two sons, one of whom died in
Naples, the other ended in a life of debauchery. As his wife was being
borne to the tomb he set himself to paint to escape from his pain.^*</p>
<p>Bernardo Strozzi straddled the top of the Magic Boot, getting bom in
Genoa, dying in Venice (1644), and leaving pictures for almost every
gallery between. For a time he was a Capuchin monk; he unfrocked him-
self, but could never shed the nickname II Cappucino. After many trials
he found tolerance and prosperity in Venice, and there he produced his
best work. One example must suffice: his Portrait of a Dominican Friar
(Bergamo) — the high beret setting off the spacious forehead, the eyes
frowning and intent, the nose and mouth breathing character, the fine
hand proclaiming pedigree; Titian himself could hardly have done better.
These heirs of the giants would have been giants in any other land.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>X3. From Padua to Bologna</p>
<p>Padua’s glory was now all in her university; there in this period
Harvey studied and Galileo taught. At Ferrara Alfonso II (r. 1559-97)
showed no slackening of vigor in that Este family that had ruled the
principality since 1208. An anonymous print in the British Museum gives
him a power- ful head, authoritative beard, eyes expressing a resolute
and somber intelligence. He could be merciless to those who crossed him,
kind to others, patient with Tasso’s tantrums, fearless in battle,
limitless in taxa - tion. He continued the Estensi tradition of favoring
literature, science, and art, and gathering their products into the
culture, splendor, and gaiety of his court. The people had to be content
with subsistence, and to enjoy vicariously the fruits of their toil.
With all his power, and three successive wives, Alfonso failed to beget
a son; and by an agreement made in 1539 Ferrara, long a papal fief,
became in 1 598 a papal state. Her cultural his- tory came to an
end.</p>
<p>Bologna, under papal rule since 1 506, had in this age a second
flower- ing, in a school of painting that dominated Italy for two
centuries and spread its influence into Spain, France, Flanders, and
England. Lodovico Carracci, son of a prosperous butcher, returned to
Bologna after studying art in Venice, Florence, Parma, and Mantua.
Tintoretto had warned him that he had no genius for painting, but
Lodovico felt that industry could substitute for genius, and that he had
genius too. He stirred with his enthusiasm his cousins Agostino and
Annibale Carracci — one a goldsmith, the other a tailor. The two went
off to Venice and Parma to study Titian and Correggio. When they came
back they joined with Lodovico in</p>
<p>opening (1589) the Accademia degli Incamminati — “of those setting
out on the road.” They provided instruction in the elements, the
history, and the technique of art, and a careful study of the masters;
they rejected the “manneristic” stress on the mannerisms or
peculiarities of any in- dividual master; they proposed, rather, to
unite the feminine tenderness of Raphael, the delicate eloquence of
Correggio, the masculine vigor of Michelangelo, the chiaroscuro of
Leonardo, and the warm coloring of Titian all in one comprehensive
style. This “Eclectic school” made</p>
<p>Bologna rival Rome as the art capital of Italy.</p>
<p>The pictures bequeathed by the Oirracci are countless; many of them
are in the Bolognese Accademia di Belle Arti; some are in the Louvre;
but one finds them anywhere. Lodovico’s own product is the least
attractive, but appears at its best in a luminous Annunciation and an
excellent Martyrdom of St. Ursula, both in the pinacoteca of the
academy. Agostino is represented by a powerful</p>

<p>Communion of St. Jerome — ^which did not prevent him from meeting a
wide demand for obscene prints. Annibale was technically the most gifted
of the clan, having derived from Correggio a refinement of line and
color rarely achieved by his cousins; see the voluptuous elegance of his
Bacchante in the Uffizi Gallery, the perfect female form in The Nymph
and the Satyr in the Pitti Palace, and the perfect male form in The
Genius of Fame in Dresden; and in Christ and the Samaritan Woman
(Vienna) he produced one of the master- pieces of this period — figures
worthy of Raphael, a landscape anticipating Poussin.</p>
<p>In 1600 Annibale and Agostino accepted the invitation of Cardinal
Farnese to come and paint the gallery of his palace in Rome. They chose
an appro- priate subject and painted The Triumph of Bacchus, a Rubensian
riot ol feminine charms. Thence Agostino went to Parma, where he painted
a great fresco for the Casino; and Annibale proceeded to Naples, whose
Museo Na- zionale still shows his characteristic counterpoint of The
Holy Family with Venus and Mars. The three cousins, so long united in
art, were far apart in death: Agostino in Parma (1602), Annibale in Rome
(1609), Lodovico still faithful to Bologna — the first to come and the
last to go (1619).</p>
<p>The new school trained several of the most famous painters of the
period. One of them, Guido Reni, had the largest following of any
painter in Europe. After his early budding under the care of the
Carracci, he yielded to the lure of Rome (1602), worked there for twenty
years, then returned to Bologna to produce pictures whose pious
sensuality and sentimental grace made them a welcome bridge between the
orthodoxy of the faith and the heresies of the flesh. Guido himself
seems to have been sincerely religious, and is reputed to have kept
himself virginally intact to the end. The self-portrait in the Capi-
toline Museum shows him in youth, pretty as a girl, with blond hair,
fair complexion, and blue eyes. His masterpiece is the Aurora frescoed
on the ceiling of the Rospigliosi Palace in Rome: the goddess of the
dawn flying through the air, followed hy gallant horses drawing a
disheveled Phoebus in his chariot, and accompanied by dancing females of
lovely face and form, representing the hours, with a winged cherub
giving a Christian imprimatur to a pagan ecstasy. Guido painted other
mythologies — ^the Rape of Helen in the Louvre, the Apples of the
Hesperides in Naples, the voluptuous Venus and Cupid in Dresden. From
the Old Testament he took his famous Susannah and the Elders (Uffizi).
But for the most part he was content to picture again the old themes
dear to the people and the Church, the story of Christ and his mother,
all suffused with what merciless critics denounce as a maudlin* exag-
geration of sentiment. He did well, however, with the Apostles, as in
the St. Matthew of the Vatican; he painted a magnificent head of
St. Joseph (Brera), and in the Vatican’s Martyrdom of St. Peter he tried
the harsh real - ism of Caravaggio. Returning to sentiment, he painted
for the galleries his</p>
<p>• Note that this word is a corruption of Magdalen — ^which is still
pronounced “maudlin” in the names of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
Magdalene College, Cambridge. The Magdalen herself did not escape the
devoted pursuit of Guido’s sensuous brush.</p>

<p>Xfamous St, Sebastian, showing the saint calmly receiving arrows into
his per- fect frame. In all this oeuvre we perceive the skill of
well-trained technique; but when we compare these saccharine sanctities
with Raphael’s Stanze or Michelangelo’s Sistine ceiling, we are moved
not by the fullness of color and the smoothness of line, but by the
“loss of nerve” in Reni’s art. He dreamed forgivably when he wrote, “I
should like to give to the figure I am about to paint such beauty as
that which dwells in P aradise” but he gave himself away when he boasted
that he had “two hundred ways of making the eyes look up to
heaven.”’</p>
<p>Domenichino (Domenico Zampieri) followed Guido’s policy of pleasing
at once the pagans and the devotees; and as these two were often one, it
proved a profitable plan. He was more complex than Guido, modest and
shy, in love with music and his wife. He too learned his art in Bologna
and then sought the fauna and florins of Rome. His success there aroused
the envy of his local competitors; they accused him of plagiarism; he
retired to Bologna, but was recalled by Gregory XV to be chief
architect, as well as chief painter, to the Vatican. With some of the
old Renaissance versatility he designed the now vanished Villa Ludovisi
at Rome and part of the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati. Moving on to
Naples, he began a series of frescoes in the cathedral. Despite
difficulties multiplied by the Neapolitan painters, he had almost com-
pleted his assignment when he died (1641), aged sixty, still in the
vigor of his art. His greatest picture is The Last Communion of St,
Jerome, in the Vatican. On the basis of this chef- d’oeuvre Poussin
ranked Domenichino second only to Raphael among painters;^® we respect
the enthusiasm more than the judg- ment. Ruskin thought Domenichino
“palpably incapable of doing anything good, great, or right in any
field, way, or kind whatsoever”;^® we admire neither the judgment nor
the rhetoric.</p>
<p>The last of the three famed pupils of the Carracci was lamentably
called Guercino — “Squint - eyed” — from an accident that distorted his
eye in infancy; but his mother called him Giovanni Francesco Barbieri.
He was already a painter, influenced by the masculine style of
Caravaggio, before he came to study with the Carracci; so he mediated in
art between Bologna and Rome. Like Guido he remained unmarried, lived
semimonastically, and displayed the best qualities of the Catholic
Reformation in his quiet and decent life. He has left us many pleasing
pictures, scattered from Rome to Chicago. He was the weakest and most
lovable of the Bolognese school.</p>
<p>The basic theory of the Eclectic school, that a great artist can
be</p>
<p>formed by trying to unite the diverse excellences of his
predecessors, was surely a mistake, for it is often the character of
genius to express a per- sonality and strike out new paths; but the
Accademia degli Incamminati served well to transmit a tradition and a
discipline without which genius may run to excesses and bizarreries. The
prosperity of the school was due in part to its ready co-operation with
the needs of the Church. The re- formed papacy and the expanding Jesuits
required fresh representations of</p>
<p>CHAP. IX )</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>the Christian story, and vivid incitations to piety and faith. The
Bolognese painters touched every chord of feeling in the worshiper;
their Madonnas and Magdalens spread throughout Catholic Christendom. Who
shall deny that the people were grateful for these inspirations, or that
in providing them the Church proved herself the most understanding
psychologist in history?</p>
<p>4 . Naples</p>
<p>The Papal States had long since absorbed Forli, Ravenna, Rimini, and
Ancona; Urbino was added in 1626, Pesaro in 1631. Thence southward
through Foggia, Bari, and Brindisi to the heel — and through Taranto,
Crotone, and Reggio Calabria to the toe — of the Magic Boot, and across
from Scylla to Charybdis through Sicily, and northward along the west
coast to Capua, was the Kingdom of Naples, since 1504 a viceroyalty of
Spain. A population of three million passionate souls labored in burning
poverty throughout that sprawling realm to finance the splendor of its
brilliant capital. Evelyn saw and described Naples in 1645:</p>
<p>The chief magistrates, being prodigiously avaricious, do wonder-</p>
<p>fully enrich themselves out of the miserable people’s labor . . .
The</p>
<p>structure of the city is, for its size, the most magnificent of any
in</p>
<p>Europe: the streets exceeding large, well paved, having many subter-
ranean passages for the sewerage; which renders them very sweet and
clean . . . To it belongeth more than 3,000 churches and monasteries,
and these the best built and adorned in Italy. The people greatly affect
the Spanish gravity in their habit; delight in good horses; the streets
are full of gallants on horseback, in coaches and sedans . . . The women
are generally well-featured, but excessively libidinous.^^</p>
<p>Everybody seemed jovial, full of music, romance, and piety; but under
that singing surface, and under the eyes of the Inquisition, heresy and
revolution brewed. In this regno the philosopher Telesio lived and died
(1588); in Nola, near Naples, Bruno was born (1548). In 1598 Campanella
took part in a rebellion that aimed to make Calabria an independent re-
public; the plot failed, and the poet-philosopher spent the next twenty-
seven years in jail.</p>
<p>In 1647 Naples went hysterical with one of those operatic
uprisings</p>
<p>that periodically disturbed agrarian exploitation in Italy. Tommaso
Aniello, popularly known as Masaniello, was a fish hawker whose wife had
been heavily fined for smuggling corn. When the Spanish governor laid a
tax on fruit to finance a navy, and the growers and the vendors of fruit
re-</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xfused to pay the imposition, Tommaso called for an armed revolt. A
hundred thousand Italians followed him as he marched to the viceregal
palace to demand withdrawal of the tax. The frightened Viceroy yielded;
Tommaso, aged twenty-four, became master of Naples, and he ruled it for
ten days. Fifteen hundred opponents were executed in a delirium of
dictatorship; a lower price was decreed for bread, and a baker who
failed to comply was roasted alive in his own oven’® — ^but Tommaso’s
enemies wrote the history. We are told that Masaniello dressed in cloth
of gold, transformed his humble home into a palace seething with
authority, and cruised about the bay in a sumptuous gondola. On July 17
he was assas- sinated by desperadoes in the pay of Spain. His
dismembered body was recovered and reunited by his followers, who gave
him a lordly funeral. The leaderless revolt died away.</p>
<p>A somber religious art maintained itself under the archbishops
and</p>
<p>the viceroys. In 1608 the Church spent a million florins to build, in
the Cathedral of San Gennaro, the Cappella del Tesoro as a shrine for
the two phials containing the coagulated blood of St. Januarius, patron
of Naples. Twice a year, the people were told, the blood must liquefy
and flow in order that Naples should prosper and be safe from
Vesuvius.</p>
<p>Painting in Naples was for a time controlled by a triumvirate of
jealous artists, Corenzio, Caracciolo, and Ribera, determined that all
Neapolitan painting should be done by themselves or their friends. They
sent such threats to Annibale Carracci that he fled to Rome, where he
died soon afterward from the effects of a hectic journey under a hot
sun.’® When Guido Reni came to decorate the Chapel of the Treasure he
received a warning to leave Naples or die; he left almost at once, his
work hardly begun. Two of his assistants, who stayed behind, were put on
a galley and never heard of again. Domenichino came, completed four
frescoes in the Chapel despite repeated erasures of his work, and then
fled before Ribera’s threats; he returned under the Viceroy’s pledge of
protection, but died shortly afterward, possibly by poison.®*</p>
<p>With all his crimes, Jose or Giuseppe Ribera must be commemorated as
the greatest painter of this period in Italy. Spain claims him through
his birth at Xadva, near Valencia (1588); he studied for a time under
Francisco de Ribalta; but in early youth he made his way to Rome. There
he lived in ragged poverty, copying frescoes and gathering crusts, until
one of those art-loving cardinal who still felt the afflatus of the
Renais- sance took him into his palace and gave him bed and board,
colors and clothes. Sedulously Giuseppe copied the works of Raphael in
the Vatican and of the Carracci in the Farnese Palace. Then, finding his
passion dulled by comfort, Lo Spagnoletto — “the little Spaniard” — ^ran
away to Parma and Modena to study Correggio. He returned to Rome,
quarreled with</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>Domenichino, and moved to Naples. There or at Rome he fell under the
influence of Caravaggio, whose brutal style confirmed him in the dark
naturalism that he may already have learned from Ribalta. A rich picture
dealer took a fancy to him and offered him a pretty daughter in
marriage. The penniless Giuseppe thought the proposal a joke, but when
it was repeated he leaped into marriage and prosperity.</p>
<p>Now he painted The Flaying of St. Bartholomew, with such bloody</p>
<p>verisimilitude that when it was exposed to public view it drew a
crowd of gazers more interested in blood than in art. The Viceroy —
^that same Osuna who conspired against Venice — asked for the picture
and its author, was fascinated, and gave Ribera charge of all
decorations in the palace. The insatiable Spaniard frightened off all
competitors until the commis- sion to fresco the Chapel of the Treasure
was given to Giovanni Lan- franco, his friend. He himself executed the
altarpiece, representing the incombustible St. Januarius issuing
unsinged from a fiery furnace.</p>
<p>Thereafter Ribera was the unchallenged master of his art in Naples.
He seemed able at will to rival the tenderness of Raphael and Correggio
without falling into the sentimentality of Guido Reni or Murillo, and to
raise the realism of Caravaggio to a higher power by the intensity of
his conception and the depth of his coloring. Let us instance only the
Pietd and the Lamentation in the church and monastery of San Martino —
“a work before which, as an embodiment of the solemn majesty of grief,
all similar representations of that century sink to mere theatrical
spectacles. Or, from the mythologies, take the Archimedes in the Prado —
^precisely such a wrinkled old Sicilian as one might find in Syracuse
today. Stepping out from the Bible and history into the streets, Ribera
found variety for his art in realistic snatches from common life; and in
the Barefoot Boy of the Louvre he gave a lead to Velazquez and
Murillo.*</p>
<p>Ribera’s defects leap to the eye — an exaggerated violence, a
fondness for wrinkles and ribs, and a thirst for blood; Byron noted
that</p>
<p>Spagnoletto tainted</p>
<p>His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.^^</p>
<p>His dark colors and somber emphasis frighten and depress us, but in a
Naples inured to Spanish rule and moods this tenebroso style found a
ready acceptance. Every new church or monastery competed for him; Philip
IV and the Neapolitan“ viceroys were avid customers; Ribera’s paintings
and etchings were more widely diffused in Spain than those of Velazquez
— ^who visited him twice in Italy. His home was one of the</p>

<p>Xfinest in Naples, and his two daughters were paragons of brown
loveliness. One of them had the distinction of being seduced by another
Don Juan, Philip IV’s natural son, who carried her off to Sicily and,
soon tiring of her, abandoned her to a Palermo nunnery. Ribera almost
succumbed to grief and shame; he sought consolation by giving to
pictures of the Virgin the remembered features of his lost Maria Rosa;
but within four years of her tragedy he died (1652).</p>

<li>ROME AND THE POPES</li>
</ol>
<p>The capital of the Papal States* and of the Roman Catholic world was
now a city of the second rank, with some 45,000 souls in 1558, rising to
100,000 under Sixtus V (1590). Montaigne, coming to it in 1580, thought
it more extensive than Paris, but having only one third as many houses.
Criminals and prostitutes (before Sixtus V) constituted a sizable part
of the population; many a noble had a standing staff of ruffians.
Poverty was general but genial, alleviated by papal charity,
ecclesiastical cere- monies, religious hopes. The old aristocratic clans
— Orsini, Colonna, Savelli, Gaetani, Chigi — had declined in income and
power, though not in claims and pride; younger families — ^Aldobrandini,
Barberini, Borghese, Farnese, Rospigliosi — ^were taking the lead in
fortune and influence, usually through connections with the popes. Papal
nepotism had another heyday: the Aldobrandini reaped a harvest from the
election of Clement VIII, the Ludovisi from Gregory XV, the Barberini
from Urban VIII,</p>
<p>the Bor ghese from Paul V. Paul’s nephew. Cardinal Scipione Borghese,
enjoying plural benefices and 150,000 scudi per year, laid out the
Villa, and built the Casino, Borghese (1615), founded its rich art
collections, and earned a moderate immortality in marble from his
protege Bernini. Many of the cardinals used their wealth to support
literature and art.</p>
<p>A succession of strong popes now helped the Roman Church to survive
despite the loss of Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Britain
to the Reformation. The Council of Trent had confirmed and enhanced the
supremacy of the popes over the councils, and the young and vigor- ous
Society of Jesus — ^the Jesuits — ^was pledged and devoted to the
papacy. Antonio Ghislieri, Dominican friar and Grand Inquisitor, became
Pope Pius V in 1566 at the age of sixty-two. The saintliness of his
personal life seemed to him fully consistent with his severity in
pursuing heresy. He withdrew from the Bohemian Catholics the right
previously granted them</p>

<p>to receive Communion in wine as well as bread. He excommunicated
Elizabeth of England and released the English Catholics from her alle-
giance. He urged Charles IX of France and Catherine de Medicis to</p>
<p>prosecute war against the Huguenots till these should be utterly and
mercilessly destroyed.^® He commended the harsh measures of Alba in the
Netherlands.^^ He labored with his dying strength to prepare the armada
that defeated the Turks at Lepanto. He never mitigated a penal
sentence;^® he encouraged the Inquisition to enforce its rules and
penal- ties.</p>
<p>He was equally strict in compelling ecclesiastical reform. Bishops
who neglected to reside in their dioceses were deposed; monks and nuns
were to remain completely secluded from the public; all malfeasance in
eccle- siastical office was to be ferreted out and punished. When some
discharged supernumeraries of the court complained that they would die
of hunger, Pius replied that it would be bett er to die of hunger than
to lose one’s soul.2® His appointments and nominations were determined
by fitness, not favoritism or nepotism. He himself worked assiduously,
sitting through long hours as judge, seldom sleeping more than five
hours in a day, and giving an example to the clergy by the ascetic
simplicity of his private life. He fasted frequently, and kept the
coarse woolen shirt of a friar under his papal robes. He wore himself
out with his severities; at sixty- eight he looked ten years older —
lean and haggard, with sunken eyes and snow-white hair. Though hardly
able to walk, he insisted upon</p>
<p>making, mostly on foot, a pilgrimage to the seven basilicas of Rome.
Nine days later, after a month of suffering, he died, clothed in the
habit of S t. Dominic. “To few popes,” wrote a great Protestant
historian, “does Catholicism owe more than to Pius V; for while pitiless
in his persecution of heresy, his recognition of the need of reform, and
his unbending resolu- tion to effect it, regained for the Church much of
the respect which it had forfeited.”<sup>’</sup> Pius was canonized in
1712.</p>
<p>Gregory XIII (1572-85) continued, in a milder spirit, the reform
of</p>
<p>the Church. We think of him as the man who gave us our calendar and
who celebrated the Massacre of St. Bartholomew with a Mass of thanks-
giving to a merciful God. Nevertheless he was a man of good morals,
temperate habits, and kindly character. He had had a natural son before
entering the priesthood, but that peccadillo was forgiven by the lusty
Romans. He was generous in charity, tireless in administration. His ap-
pointments have won Protestant praise.^® Montaigne saw him in 1580 as “a
handsome old man, a face full of majesty, a long white beard. Over</p>

<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xnots, deposing Elizabeth — required ducats. To raise them Gregory
or- dered the letter of the law to be applied to the owners and the
title deeds of estates in papal territory; many properties that should
have lapsed to the papacy through failure in the direct line of
succession, or in the pay- ment of dues required from papal fiefs, were
now confiscated by the Pope. Actual or prospective victims armed their
retainers, resisted expro- priation, and retaliated with brigandage. Men
of aristocratic lineage, like Alfonso Piccolomini and Roberto Malatesta,
led bands of outlaws who captured towns and controlled roads. Taxes
could no longer be collected; the flow of gold to Rome was dammed; soon
the papal administration was in chaos. Gregory suspended his
confiscations, made peace with Piccolomini, and died in humiliating
defeat.</p>
<p>Emergencies make men, and this one made Felice Peretti, as Sixtus V
(1585-90), one of the greatest popes. He first saw the light at Grotta-
mare, near Ancona, in a cottage so ill thatched that the sun shone
through the roof; later he jested that he was ^’’nato di casa illmtre ”
— ^bom of an illustrious (or well-lighted) house.®® Schooled at a
Franciscan monastery in Montalto, earning a doctorate in theology by his
studies in Bologna and Ferrara, he rose rapidly by his pulpit eloquence
and administrative capacity; and when, at sixty-four, he was chosen
pope, it was because the conclave recognized in him the resolute
character needed to restore safety and solvency to the Papal States.</p>
<p>His relatives crowded around him with outstretched palms, and he</p>
<p>could not resist them; nepotism was renewed. But where his family was
not concerned, he was inflexible. His appearance itself gave pause:
short, broad, strongly built, with a great forehead, a thick white
beard, big nose and ears, vast eyebrows, and piercing eyes that could
silence opposition</p>
<p>without a word. His florid complexion went with a violent temper, his
large head suggested unbending will. With all his severity he had a well
of good humor, and often a penetrating wit; he predicted that Henry IV
would defeat Mayenne because Henry spent less time in bed than Mayenne
did at meals.®^ He himself slept little and worked hard.</p>
<p>He resolved, first of all, to suppress the victorious brigands. He
began by enforcing the existing prohibition, heretofore largely ignored,
against carrying murderous weapons. On the day before his coronation
four youths were arrested for violating this ordinance; Sixtus ordered
them hanged forthwith. Their relatives pleaded for pardon or delay; he
replied, “While I live, every criminal must die”; soon, amid the
coronation festi - vities, their bodies hung on one gallows near the
Sant’ Angelo Bridge. I t was Sixtus’ inaugural address, a statement of
policy on crime.</p>
<p>The Pope commanded the nobles to dismiss their bravi; he promised
pardon and reward to any bandit who would deliver to him another</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>bandit alive or dead; and the reward was to be paid by the captured
bandit’s family or commune. When one bandit issued a defiance, Sixtus
ordered the outlaw’s family to find him and bring him in or suffer death
themselves. The Duke of Urbino pleased the Pope®^ by loading mules with
poisoned food and directing the drivers to pass by a bandit’s lair; the
bandits robbed the pack, ate, and died. No consideration was given to
holy orders or social rank; offenders belonging to “first families” were
executed without mercy or delay; a priest outlaw dangled with the rest.
Soon the countryside was dotted with corpses swaying in the wind, and
the wits of Rome calculated that more severed heads were nailed to the
Sant’ Angelo Bridge than there were melo ns in the market stalls.®® The
people murmured that the Pope was barbarously cruel, but ambassadors
told him that “in every part of his states through which their road had
led, they had traveled through a land blessed with peace and
security.”®^ The proud pontiff had coins struck with the inscription
Noli me tangere. In a fury of virtue he ordered a priest and a boy
burned for homosexual acts, and compelled a young woman to witness the
hanging of the mother who had sold her into prostitution. All detected
adulteries were to be punished with death. Men were arrested for crimes
dating so far back that a placard quoted St. Peter as trembling with
fear lest Sixtus should indict him for cutting off Malchus’ ear on the
occasion of Christ’s arrest.</p>
<p>Amid this mad pursuit he found time for government and reform. He
ended the war of confiscations that Gregory XIII had waged against the
nobles. He reconciled those ancient foes the Orsini and the Colonna by
uniting them in marriage. He distributed the cardinals among eleven new
and four old “congregations,” and divided among these the administra -
tion of the Curia. He commanded the clergy to observe all the reform
decrees of the Council of Trent, and required periodical visitation and
correction of monasteries by the bishops. Fornication with a nun was to
be punished by the death of both parties. He revived to full activity
the University of Rome. To accommodate the great increase of books he
commissioned Domenico Fontana to design a sumptuous new home for the
Vatican Library. He personally supervised an improved edition of
Jerome’s Vulgate — which is as splendid a translation of the Bible into
Latin as the King James version is into English.</p>
<p>He did not share the respect that his Renaissance predecessors had
felt for the remains of pagan art. He completed the ruin of the
Septizonium of Severus to provide columns for St. Peter’s. He proposed
to raze the tomb of Caecilia Metella. He threatened to demolish the
Capitol itself if the statues of Jupiter Tonans, Apollo, and Minerva
were not removed; he allowed Minerva to remain, but rechristened her
Roma and replaced her spear with a cross. He exorcised the columns of
Trajan and Marcus</p>
<p>242 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XAurelius by topping them with statues of St. Peter or St. Paul and
re- naming the columns accordingly. To further symbolize the subjection
of paganism to Christianity, he engaged Domenico Fontana to transfer to
St. Pet er’s Square the obelisk that Caligula had brought from
Heliopolis and that Nero had set up in the Circus Maximus. The monolith
of red granite was eighty-three feet high and weighed over a million
Roman pounds. Masterful architects like Antonio da Sangallo and
Michelangelo had pronounced its removal to be beyond the capacity of
Renaissance engineers. Domenico and his brother Giovanni took a year to
accomplish the task (1585-86). Immense machines lowered and transported
the monu- ment; eight hundred men, fortified by the Sacrament, and 140
horses pulled forty- four ropes, each as thick as a man’s arm, to raise
it aloft on its new site. Domenico, succeeding, became the hero of Rome;
Sixtus struck commemorative medals and sent official announcements to
foreign governments. The ball at the top was replaced with a cross
containing a piece of the “true cross” on which Christ had died. Sixtus
felt that Chris - tianity had resumed its sway after its interruption by
the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The indefatigable Pope, in his brief quinquennium, renovated secular
Rome. He brought in a fresh supply of good water — feeding twenty-seven
new fountains — by rebuilding the ruined Acqua Alessandria, which he
renamed, after himself, Acqua Felice. He cleared the air by financing
the drainage of the marshes; good progress was made and 9,600 acres were
reclaimed, but the enterprise was abandoned at his death. At his bidding
Domenico Fontana opened up new avenues on the classic plan of straight
lines; the Via Sistina was prolonged as the Via Felice; the noble Church
of Santa Maria Maggiore became the center of several radial thorough-
fares; Rome began to assume its modern form. To finance his undertakings
Sixtus, starting with an empty treasury, taxed even the necessaries of
life, debased the coinage, sold appointments, and issued annuity
insurance {monti) for life in return for gifts to the papal exchequer.
He adminis- tered his funds with competence and care, and left five
million crowns in his coffers at his death.</p>
<p>His greatest concern was foreign policy. He never abandoned hope of
regaining England and Germany and uniting all Christendom against Islam.
He admired Elizabeth’s statesmanship, but lent hi s aid to plots to
depose her. He promised to contribute to the expense of the Spanish
Armada, but he distrusted Philip’s dallying, and shrewdly made his aid
conditional on the actual landing of Spanish troops in England. France
was his greatest problem. The Huguenots, supposedly exterminated in
1572, were advancing upon Paris under the undiscourageable Henry of
Navarre. Philip II was financing the League to save France for Catholi-
cism — and for Spain; Sixtus faced the choice of letting France go

<p>243</p>
<p>estant or helping Philip to turn France into a Spanish dependency.
But a balance of power between France and Spain seemed indispensable to
papal freedom from secular domination. In 1589 Sixtus offered to join in
war against Henry; but when Henry promised to become a Catholic, Sixtus
withdrew from the plan. Philip threatened tQ, detach Spain from the
papal obedience, and a Spanish Jesuit denounced the Pope as abetting
heresy, but Sixtus held his ground and welcomed Henry’s ambassador. In
the end his faith in Henry was justified: France was saved to the Church
and continued as a balance against Spain.</p>
<p>This was his last triumph, and perhaps the strain of it exhausted
him. Neither the cardinals nor the nobles nor the people regretted his
death (1590); the cardinals had winced under his severity; the nobles
had been forced, against the most time-honored customs, to obey the
laws; the people, taxed to the limit and disciplined to unwonted peace,
tried to demolish the statue that had been raised to Sixtus on the
Capitol. But after the blows he dealt had lost their sting, posterity
could balance his achieve- ments against his cruelty, his pride, and his
love of power. A rationalist historian, Lecky, judged him, “though not
the greatest man, by far the greatest statesman, who has ever sat on the
papal throne.”*®</p>
<p>Among his successors in this period two are especially memorable.</p>
<p>Clement VIII (1592- 1605) was almost a Christian. “Of all the
popes</p>
<p>that have for a long time past sat in the see of Rome,” siid the
Huguenot Sully, he “was most free from party prejudices, and had more of
that gentleness and compassion which the Gospel presc ribed”;*® however,
he refused mercy to Beatrice Cenci (1599), and allowed the Inquisition
to burn Giordano Bruno at the stake (1600). Urban VIII (1623-44) at
first aided Spain and Austria in the Thirty Years’ War; but when they
tried to absorb Mantua he feared encirclement, and turned his diplomatic
maneuvers to co-operation with Richelieu in using the Protestant armies
of Gustavus Adolphus to weaken the Hapsburg power. Infected with the
military spirit of the age, he subordinated spiritual concerns to the
extension of his rule as a secular prince; he acquired Urbino, and
heavily taxed it — and his other states — to finance a papal army for
war against the Duke of Parma. The army proved worthless, and his death
left the papal realm “in such a condition of decay and exhaustion,”
reported a Venetian ambassador, “that it is impossible for it ever to
rise or re -</p>
<p>cover.”*’^ The ambassador was mistaken. Elements of recovery

<p>XSales, and Vincent de Paul revealed the capacity of the old Church
to inspire an absorbing devotion; so the Jesuit Aloysius Gonzaga died at
the age of twenty-three while ministering to the victims of pestilence
in Rome (1591). Worldliness and corruption in the Curia gave way before
the assaults of Protestant reformers, the exhortations of saints, the
in- spiring example of prelates like St. Charles Borromeo of Milan. From
pope to pope the movement of self-reform, however halting, grew. Old
reli- gious orders were reinvigorated, new ones multiplied — ^the
Oratorians (1564), the Oblates of St. Ambrose (1578), the Regular Clerks
Minor (1588), the Lazarists (1624), the Sisters of Charity (1633), and
many</p>
<p>more. Seminaries were established throughout Catholic Christendom to
train an educated secular clergy. Catholic missionaries went to every
non- Christian land, facing hardships and perils, tending the sick,
educating the young, and preaching the faith. And everywhere, battling
Protestants in Germany, plotting politics in France, dying for their
cause in England, carrying the creed to “heathens” in five continents,
moved the incredible, indomitable Jesuits.</p>

<p>After the death of Diego Laynez (1565), the Society of Jesus
chose</p>
<p>as its general Francisco Borgia, whose character and career were an
earnest of the time. Born rich, grandson of Pope Alexander VI, rising to
be Duke of Gandia, Viceroy of Catalonia, and friend of kings, he joined
the new order in 1 546, gave it all his personal wealth, and earned
canon- ization by the austere sanctity of his life. Everard Mercurian,
who followed him as general, left no mark on history; but Claudio
Aquaviva guided the society with such wisdom and tact through
thirty-four troubled years (1581-1615) that many Jesuits now rank him
highest of all their generals since Loyola. When he took command there
were some five thousand Jesuits; when he died there were thirteen
thousand.</p>
<p>Under his direction a committee of Jesuit scholars drew up (1584-99)
the Ratio studiorum, which continued till 1836 to determine the order
and method of studies in Jesuit colleges. Taking boys of eleven to
fourteen years of age, the six-year course gave them three years of the
Greek and Latin languages and literatures; the remaining years were
devoted to phi- losophy in its broadest sense, as including natural
science, logic, meta- physics, and ethics. The consensus of evidence is
that all these subjects were admirably taught. The philosophy was
Scholastic, but as yet there</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>was no acceptable substitute. Biology and modern secular history, as
in nearly all schools of that time, were largely ignored, perhaps
because the awful sight of the struggle for existence among animals, and
the almost uninterrupted pageant of war among men, offended the trustful
simplicity of faith. All in all, the Ratio was a skillful compromise
between the Mid- dle Ages and the Renaissance. With remarkable
adaptability, the Jesuits welcomed the rebirth of the drama; they
translated, wrote, and staged plays, and discovered in student dramatics
a lively means of teaching speech and eloquence; in stage management and
scenery they were ahead of their times. They used debates to sharpen
wits and reason, but they discouraged originality of ideas in teacher
and pupil alike. Their aim was apparently to produce an educated but
conservative elite capable of intelligent and practical leadership, yet
untroubled by doctrinal doubts and immovably rooted in the Catholic
creed.</p>
<p>In almost all cases the Jesuit schools were founded and endowed by
secular authorities, ecclesiastical leaders, or moneyed individuals, but
the Jesuits kept full control. Though a few of their colleges were
specifically established for the sons of the nobility, nearly all were
open, without tuition fees, to any qualified student, rich or poor.®*
The teachers, usually members of the order, were better trained than
their Protestant analogues; they were devoted and unpaid, and their
priestly garb and bearing gave them a revered authority that enabled
them to keep discipline without resorting to fear or corporal
punishment. Many Protestants sent their sons to Jesuit colleges,®*
hoping to get for them not only a sound education in the classics, but
also a superior discipline of morals, manners, and character. “As for
the pedagogical part,” wrote Francis Bacon, “the shortest rule would be,
‘Consult the schools of the Jesuits,’ for nothing better has been put in
practice .”^* In 1615 the Jesuits had 372 colleges; in 1700 they had
769, and twenty-four universities, scattered throughout the world. In
Catholic countries secondary education fell almost entirely into their
hands, giving them an immense influence in shaping the national
mind.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale they sought the ear of kings.
Aquaviva</p>
<p>forbade them to become royal confessors and discouraged their
participa- tion in politics; nevertheless, even in Aquaviva’s lifetime.
Father Coton ac - cepted Henry IV’s invitation to be his spiritual
director; and thereafter</p>
<p>Frankly declaring their intent to mingle with mankind instead of
isolating themselves in monasteries, they adapted their moral precepts
to the incor-</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xrigible ways of mankind. In their judgment the strict Christian
ethic was possible only for hermits and saints; the realities of human
nature required some mitigation of the perfect rule. Such adjustments of
the ethical code had been made by Aristotle in reaction against the
perfectionism of Plato, and by the rabbis in fitting the old Hebraic
laws to the novel conditions of urban life. Though in their doctrine —
and usually in their own practice — the Jesuits despised the flesh, they
understood the flesh, and they gave it some moral leeway lest sinners be
driven into rebellion and be lost to the Church. To reduce the strain
between the code of Christ and the nature of man, Jesuit and other
theologians developed casuistry — the appli- cation of moral doctrines
to particular cases. But let us leave this subtle science till we come
to its greatest enemy, Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>Generally, in their theology, the Jesuits leaned to liberal views.
Some, like Fathers Less and Hamel at Louvain (1585), thought it
unnecessary to believe that every word or every doctrine in the Bible
was inspired by God.^^ Nearly all Jesuits emphasized the Scholastic
tenet that secular gov- ernments derive their power from the people; and
not a few, like Mariana and Busenbaum, preached the right of the people,
through their lawful representatives, to depose, even t o kill, a “bad”
king; but “bad” in this connection meant heretical, and the democratic
emphasis may have come from the desire of the Jesuits, in their
“ultramontanist” loyalty to Rome, to exalt the uniquely divine and
supreme authority of the pope. The Jesuits upheld, against Luther, the
efficacy of good works in earning salvation; they deprecated the
emphasis on original sin, and they offset the dark predestinarianism of
Paul, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Jansen with a reaffirmation of free
will. Luis Molina, a Portuguese Jesuit, roused a the- ological furor by
arguing that man, through his own will and works, can determine his
eternal fate, and that man’s free choice can co -operate with or
overcome divine grace. Dominican theologians demanded that Molina be
condemned as a heretic; Jesuits came to his defense; and the controversy
rose to such a temperature that Clement VIII ordered both sides to hold
their peace (1596).</p>
<p>The comparatively humane ethics of the Jesuits combined with their
radical ideas, conservative associations, and spreading power to make
them unpopular with the secular Catholic clergy and hated with special
warmth by the Protestants. St. Charles Borromeo charged them with being
scandal- ously lenient with influential sinners.^* If, said Sarpi,
St. Peter had been directed by a Jesuit confessor, he might have arrived
at denying Christ without sin.^® Mutio Vitelleschi, who succeeded
Aquaviva as general of the Jesuits, warned his order that its anxiety to
accumulate wealth was arousing wide reproach.“*^ Protestant divines in
England, committed to the doctrine that their kings ruled by divine
right, were shocked by Jesuit</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>247</p>
<p>ideas of popular sovereignty and occasional regicide. Robert Filmer
de- nounced Cardinal Bellarmine’s opinion that “secular or civil power
is . . . in the people, unless they bestow it on a prince.”^® German
Protestants</p>
<p>2 . In Partibus Infidelium</p>
<p>In the eyes of Catholic populations the faults of the Jesuits were
far out- weighed by their merits as educators and their courage as
missionaries. Other religious orders shared in the devout adventure of
spreading the faith; but what could compare with the audacity,
enterprise, and martyr- doms of the Jesuits in India, China, Japan, and
the Americas? In India the enlightened Mogul Emperor Akbar invited some
Jesuits to his court at Fatehpur Sikri (1579); he listened to them with
curiosity and sympathy, but refused to dismiss his harem. An Italian
aristocrat, Roberto de’ Nobili, entered the Society of Jesus, went to
India as a missionary (1605), studied the Hindu creeds and rituals,
adopted the dress and rules of the Brahmin caste, composed works in
Sanskrit, and made some converts to Christianity. Other Jesuits became
yogis and worked among the lower classes. Jesuit missionaries crossed
the Himalayas into Tibet about 1624 and gave Europe its first — and for
a long time its last — ^reliable information concerning that hidden
world.</p>
<p>As early as 1 549 the Jesuits entered Japan; by 1 580 they claimed
100,000 converts; in 1587 they were ordered to leave the islands; in
1597 they and the Franciscan friars suffered a furious persecution, in
which priests, monks, and thousands of Japanese Christians were
crucified — a new tech- nique which the killers claimed to have learned
from the Gospels. About 1616 a fresh group of Jesuits entered Japan and
garnered new converts in considerable number. But Dutch and English
merchants, believing that the Jesuits were paving the way for Portuguese
or Spanish trade, prodded the government into renewed persecution;^®
thirty-one Jesuits were put to death, and by 1645 Christianity had
disappeared from Japan.</p>
<p>China was a challenging peril, for the emperors had promised death to
any Christian daring to enter the “Middle Kingdom.” We have seen else -
where how the Jesuit Francis Xavier died (1552) almost in sight of
the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XChina that he had resolved to convert. In 1557 Portuguese merchants
es- tablished a settlement at Macao, on the southeast coast of China.
There some Jesuits devoted themselves to learning Chinese dialects and
ways. Finally two of them, Matteo Ricci and Michele Ruggieri, entered
the province of Kwantung, armed with languages, astronomy, mathematics,
clocks, watches, books, maps, and instruments. The provincial viceroy
was charmed with these novelties; and as Ricci and Ruggeri assumed
Chinese names and dress, lived simply, worked hard, and conducted them-
selves with the modesty that the Chinese expected from the children of
so young and immature a civilization as Europe’s, they were allowed to
re - main. Ricci made his way to Canton, where he impressed the
mandarins with his scientific and geographical knowledge. He constructed
sundials, drew convenient and trustworthy maps, and made difficult
astronomical calculations. He initiated his new friends into
Christianity by writing a catechism in which the basic Christian beliefs
were explained and sup- ported by quotations from classical Oriental
texts. Emboldened by the toleration he received, he moved to a suburb of
Peking (1601) and sent a clock to the Emperor K’ang -hsi. When the clock
stopped and no Chi- nese scholar could start it again, the “Son of
Heaven” sent for the donor. Ricci came, fixed the clock, and introduced
other scientific instruments to the curious ruler; soon Ricci and other
Jesuits were established at the Ming court. The genial Emperor raised no
obstacle to the conversion of many upper- class Chinese. After Ricci’s
death (1610) another Jesuit,</p>
<p>Johann Adam Schall von Bell, carried on the scientific and
proselytizing work of the mission. He reformed the Chinese calendar,
made superior cannon for the Chinese armies, became an intimate and
honored friend of the Emperor, dressed in mandarin silks, lived in a
palace, played politics, was demoted to a jail, and died within a year
after his release.</p>
<p>The sequel of the story, reaching into the eighteenth century, might
amuse a philosophical historian. The Jesuits in China, so versed in
science, had shed the dogmatism of theology. When they studied the
Chinese classics they were moved by the high wisdom they discovered
there. The Chinese worship of ancestors appeared as an admirable
inducement to moral and social stability; and there was plenty in
Confucius to warrant his veneration. But other missionaries complained
to the Roman Inquisi- tion (1645) that the Jesuits were minimizing the
crucifix and the doctrine of divine redemption, as likely to shock
Chinese unaccustomed to the idea of men killing a god; that the Jesuits
read the Mass not in Latin but in Chinese; that they allowed their
converts to retain many rites of the native religion; and that Jesuit
missionaries were acquiring wealth as physicians, surgeons, merchants,
moneylenders, and advisers to generals and emperors. The Jesuits in
their turn were appalled by Dominican and</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>Franciscan insistence on telling the Chinese that Christianity was
the sole escape from eternal damnation, and that the ancestors whom they
wor- shiped were burning in hell. Innocent X ordered the Jesuits to
forbid the sacrifices of meat and drink offered to the shades of
ancestors. Meanwhile the Jesuit fathers were sending to Europe those
descriptions of Chinese life, religion, and thought which were to share
in disturbing Christian orthodoxy in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>In South America the Jesuit missionaries won the respect and trust of
the natives by opening schools and medical centers, and laboring to
mitigate the brutality of the Spanish masters. They compiled
dictionaries and grammars, explored the dangerous interiors, and
immensely advanced geog- raphy. They sent to Europe the Peruvian bark
which, as quinine, became the standard drug for treating malaria. And in
Paraguay they set up a com- munistic Utopia.</p>
<p>There, in the pampas and woods bordering the Uruguay River, and</p>
<p>above dangerous waterfalls that discouraged colonists, they organized
their own Indian settlements. With the permission of Philip III of
Spain, they excluded all white men except Jesuits and the colonial
governor. They claimed to have found the inhabitants to be of a
childlike and friendly dis- position — “two hundred thousand Indians in
every way fitted for the</p>
<p>The economy, as well as the government, was entirely under Jesuit</p>
<p>control. The natives showed remarkable aptitude in duplicating
European products, even complex watches, delicate lace, and musical
instruments. Work was compulsory, but youths were allowed to choose
their trades, and leisure was provided for recreation and cultural
development. The average workday was eight hours. The Jesuits fixed the
hours of work, sleep, prayer, and play. Part of the soil was
individually owned; most of it was communal property. The product of
communal labor was turned over to the government; part of it was set
aside for sowing or for bad years; part went to pay a head tax to the
Spanish king; most of it was dis-</p>

<p>Xtributed to the twenty thousand families according to their need;
presum- ably some part went to support, on a modest level,®® the 1 50
Jesuits who served as directors, overseers, physicians, teachers, and
priests. A royal decree, suggested by the Jesuits, forbade them to share
in the profits of the economy, and required them to render a periodic
accounting to their provincial head. Law was administered by native
judges and police. Penal- ties included flogging, imprisonment, and
banishment, but there was no capital punishment. Each settlement had its
own hospital, college, church, and facilities for the old or infirm. It
was a theocratic communism: the natives received sustenance, security,
peace and a limited cultural life, in return for accepting Christianity
and discipline.</p>
<p>Whence had the Jesuits derived the idea for this remarkable regime?
Perhaps in part from More’s Utopia (1516), in part from the Gospels, in
part from the constitution of their own society, which was itself a com-
munistic isle in an individualistic sea. In any case the system proved
popular with the natives; it was established by persuasion without
force; it main- tained itself for 130 years (c. 1620-1750); and when it
was attacked from without it defended itself with an ardor that
astonished its assailants. Even the skeptics of the French Enlightenment
were impressed. “By means of re - ligion,” wrote d’Alembert, “the
Jesuits established a monarchical 〔?〕</p>
<p>authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion
and on their lenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they
ren- dered happy the people under their sway.” Voltaire described the
experi- ment as “a triumph of humanity.”®^</p>
<p>It ended in disaster because it could not isolate itself from outside
hu- manity. Spanish traders reproached the Jesuits with engaging in
conunerce; Spanish colonists resented their exclusion from an area
inviting exploita- tion of resources and men.®* Slave-hunting bands
repeatedly attacked the Jesuit settlements. The fathers and their
subjects evacuated the regions that were most exposed to these raids.
When the raids penetrated farther, the Jesuits secured permission from
the King of Spain to arm their natives with European weapons; thereafter
the raids were successfully resisted. More dangerous to the colony was
the course of European politics and thought. The persistent political
intrigues of Jesuits in France, Spain, and Portugal combined with the
rise of free thought and anticlericalism to lead to the expulsion of the
order from nearly all countries in the second half of the eighteenth
century. The Marquis of Pombal, as ruling minister in Portugal, was
especially active in the movement against the Jesuits. In 1750 he
arranged a treaty by which Portugal ceded to Spain the colony of San
Sacramento, at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, in exchange for Spanish
lands farther north — ^which included seven Jesuit settlements
containing thirty thousand Indians. Meanwhile a false rumor was
circulated that the</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>lands in question contained gold which the Jesuits were hoarding. The
Portuguese authorities ordered the fathers and the natives to leave the
seven settlements within thirty days. The Jesuits (one excepted)
counseled submission; the Indians preferred to resist, and they held off
Portuguese attacks through five years. In 1755 the Portuguese army
brought up artillery; hundreds of the Indians were massacred; the
remainder fled to the forests or surrendered; the Jesuits were ordered
by their European su- periors to return to Spain. The experiment in what
Muratori called Cristi- anesimo felice^^ came to an end.</p>
<p>The story of the Jesuit missionaries in North America is better known
to us, and need only be noted to round out the perspective of Jesuit
activity in this age. They entered Mexico in 1572 and shared in the
rapid conversion of the natives to Christianity, but the main burden of
that enterprise was borne by the Dominicans and the Franciscans; these
last left a trail of lovely missions and mendicant beneficence all the
way from Mexico to the fascinating city that bears their founder’s name.
Many Jesuits suffered torture and violent death in the attempt to win
the Indians to Catholicism. Isaac Jogues was mutilated, enslaved, and
slain; Jean de Brebeuf, Gabriel Lalemant, Anthony Daniel and other
Jesuits were burned at the stake or were boiled to death in the two
years 1648-49. We may not agree with the theology that these men sought
to inculcate, but we must honor their humanity and devotion, if only as
a pitiful offset to the cruelty and greed of the slave-hunting,
slave-driving Christian settlers who complained that the humanitarian
activities of the missionaries were unfitting the Indians for
civilization.</p>

<li>ITALUN DAYS AND NIGHTS</li>
</ol>
<p>“The people of Rome,” said Montaigne, seeing them in 1581, “seem less
religious than in the good towns in France, but much more given to cere-
mony.”®^ The ceremonies of Holy Week included processions of bleeding
self-flagellants, the public pronouncement of papal excommunications,
and an exhibition of the veil with which Veronica had wiped the sweat
from the brow of Christ. “On Easter Eve I saw, in the Church of
St. John</p>
<p>Lateran, the heads of St. Paul and St. Peter, which are on show
there, and which still have thei r flesh, complexion, and beard, as if
they were alive.”®® Exorcisms were performed with impressive ritual,
perhaps as mass psycho- therapy. Catholicism in Italy deliberately
ignored the minds of the elite and offered to the masses of the people a
beneficent but unwelcome moral code wrapped up in poetry, drama,
symbolism, catharsis, and hope.</p>
<p>Montaigne bore witness to a general improvement of morals, but
much</p>
<p>1 tHE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (cHAP. I</p>
<p>Xof the old laxity remained in the relations of the sexes. The
Italian theater was so loose in action and dialogue that the Venetian
Senate, which winked at prostitution, expelled all actors from its
territory (1577).®® Obscene liter- ature could be bought in any large
town, as now almost anywhere in Christendom. Pius V made homosexual
actions a capital crime, to the dis- may of noble Roman youths. Eight
Portuguese inverts entered into a formal marriage; they were arrested
and burned at the stake.®’’ Pius also decreed the expulsion of
prostitutes from the Papal States (1566). Business- men complained that
the edict would depopulate the city; the Pope al- lowed a few courtesans
to remain in a segregated quarter, and gave sub- stantial help to women
who tried to transfer to a younger profession. Sixtus V, who conquered
the bandits, won only Pyrrhic victories against the courtesans, as
evidenced by his repeated edicts of 1586, 1588, and 1 589.</p>
<p>Since romantic love was still an extramarital vagary, and marriage
was a mating of dividends, and divorce was forbidden by the Church,
imagina- tive spouses indulged in adultery. Pius V thought of making it
a capital crime; a report of August 25, 1568, said, “The threat of the
death penalty for adultery is expected, so that everyone will have to
become moral or leave the city.” Pius, relenting, contented himself with
milder penalties: a noble Roman lady was sentenced to life imprisonment;
a prominent banker was publicly whipped; many other offenders were
banished.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the sixteenth century the cicisbeatura came in from
Spain through Naples and Milan: a husband, in the upper classes, might
allow a friend to be the cicisbeo, or cavaliere servente (gentleman at-
tendant), of his wife; apparently the custom had arisen in Spain in
times of frequent wars and long absences of the husband fiom home. The
knightly servitor waited on a lady from her rising to her bedding, but
convention did not yet condone the adultery that often attended the
custom in the Italy of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Despite theological deterrents, crime flourished. Bravi in noble
homes, brigands on the highway, pirates in the Mediterranean, political
and amorous assassinations abounded. Paolo Giordano Orsini, like another
Othello, strangled Isabella de’ Medici in her bed; Piero de’ Medici
murdered</p>

<p>evidence of incestuous relations with his daughter. Beatrice found
means of having a liaison with Olimpio Calvetti, keeper of the castle.
At the instigation, or in the pay, of Beatrice, of her stepmother, and
of her brothers Giacomo and Bernardo, the keeper, with the aid of a
professional assassin, killed the father in his bed (1598). The
conspirators were arrested and tried; they pleaded unbearable
provocation, and many citizens begged Clement VIII for clemency; he
refused. Beatrice and Lucrezia were be- headed, and Giacomo was tortured
to death.®®</p>
<p>Nevertheless, morals were improving, manners were softening, and
Italian society had charms and graces that only the French could rival.
Dress, in the upper ranks, was a colorful fancy of velvets, satins, and
silks. About this time aristocratic women began to frame their faces,
crown their heads, and drape their shoulders with the black silk
mantiglia already popu- lar in Spain. Men of social pretension still
walked in high hose, but com- moners and merchants, familiar with
Turkish garb, were slipping into trousers. Italian comedy satirized the
custom in the stock comic character Pantaleone, who became pantaloons
and pants.</p>
<p>As in most Latin countries, amusements were plentiful. Rome had its
annual carnival before Lent; the streets, as Evelyn saw them in 1645,
“swarm with prostitutes, buffoons, and all manner of rabble”;®® there
were races in the Corso, with fleet steeds from Barbary, riderless but
prodded by spurs hanging against their sides, and races of asses,
buffaloes, old men, naked men, and boys; and plays were performed on
movable stages in the open air. The arts of the dance, conversation, and
flirtation graced homes, gardens, and streets. And was there an Italian
who could not sing?</p>
<p>V. THE BIRTH OF THE OPERA</p>
<p>Religion, love, the dance, the court, even work shared in generating
music. Evel yn found the rural Italians “so jovial and addicted to music
that the very husbandmen almost universally play on the guitar . . . and
will commonly go to the field with their fiddle.”®® Every ducal court
had its choir and maestro di cappella-, at Ferrara a female quartet
famous as the “Concert of Ladies” moved Tasso to tears and rhymes.
Madrigals of love wove their polyphonic plaints, making the adoration of
woman, till mar- ried, almost as reverent as the litanies to the Mother
of God. Masses, vespers, motets, and hymns rolled from a thousand
organs; choirs of emasculated boys (evirati, castratt) began, about
1600, to thrill the naves; a Protestant visitor described Catholic
church music “sung by eunuchs and other rare</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XStir even the savage breast to orthodoxy. Andrea Gabrieli, Claudio
Merulo, and Andrea’s nephew Giovanni Gabrieli in succession drew
thousands to St. Mark’s in Venice to hear their organ -playing, their
orchestras, and their choirs. When Girolamo Frescobaldi played the great
organ at St. Peter’s as many as thirty thousand crowded in or around the
church to hear. His varied compositions, complex with their difficult
experiments, influenced Domenico Scarlatti, and prepared for the
harmonic evolutions of Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>Musical instruments were almost as diverse as today. Toward the
middle of the sixteenth century the violin, evolving out of the lyre,
began to re- place the viol. The first great violinmakers, Gasparo da
Salo and his pupil Giovanni Maggini, worked at Brescia; from them, it
seems, Andrea Amati learned the art and took it to Cremona, where his
sons handed it down to the Guarneri and the Stradivari. The innovation
encountered opposition from those who preferred the softer and gentler
tones of the viols; for a century the viols, the lutes, and the violins
competed; but when the Amati found ways of tempering the shrillness of
the violin, the new instrument, helped by the growing predominance of
soprano voices in vocal music, rose to unchallenged leadership.</p>
<p>Compositions were still for the voice rather than for instruments. To
this period belongs the romantic figure of Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of</p>
<p>Venosa, who graced pedigree with music and murder with madrigals. Bom
in Naples (c. 1560), he became a virtuoso of the lute, married a high-
born lady, had her and her lover killed on suspicion of adultery, fled
to Ferrara, married Donna Eleonora d’Este, and published five books of
madrigals whose adventurous harmonies and sharp modulations moved from
Renaissance to modern polyphonic forms. In February 1600 Emilio de’
Cavalieri, in the Oratory, or prayer chapel, of St. Philip Neri in Rome,
produced a semidramatic allegory, with only symbolic action, but with
orchestra, dancing, chorus, and soloists; this “first oratorio” preceded
by only eight months, and in many ways resembled. Peri’s opera Euridice.
A generation later Giacomo Carissimi composed oratorios and cantatas
whose monodic chants influenced the development of operatic
recitatives.</p>
<p>Many other lines of musical growth converged to produce the opera.
Some medieval sacre rappresentazioni had added music and song to the
action; in these, as in her Passion music, the Church was mother or
nurse of opera as of so many other arts. Recitatives accompanied by
music had been heard in late medieval courts. Renaissance scholars had
pointed out that parts of Greek tragedies had been sung or recited to
instrumental accompaniments. At the court of Mantua, in 1472, Angelo
Poliziano united music and drama in his brief Favola di Orfeo; now that
sad fable began its long odyssey through opera. The masque, so popular
in sixteenth-century courts, provided another road to opera; probably
the ballet, the lavish</p>

<p>scenery, and the sumptuous costumes of modem opera descend from the
dancing, the pageantry, and the gorgeous dress that predominated over
the action in Renaissance masques.</p>
<p>Toward the close of the sixteenth century a group of musical and</p>
<p>literary enthusiasts, meeting in the home of Giovanni Bardi in
Florence, proposed to revive the music drama of the Greeks by freeing
song from the heavy polyphony and drowned-out language of the madrigals,
and restor- ing it to what was believed to be the monodic style of
ancient tragedy. One member, Vincenzo Galilei, father of the astronomer,
set to monodic music parts of Dante’s Inferno. Two other members, the
poet Ottavio Rinuccini and the singer Jacopo Peri, composed the libretto
and the score for what may be reckoned the first opera, Dafne, which was
produced in the home of Jacopo Corsi in 1597.®^ The performance was so
applauded that Rinuccini was invited to write the words, and Peri and
Giulio Caccini the music, of a more substantial composition to celebrate
the marriage of Henry IV and Maria de’ Medici at Florence (October 6,
1600). The</p>
<p>Euridice there performed is the oldest opera still extant. Peri
apologized for the imperfections of his hurried work, and hoped to “have
opened the path for the talent of others, for them to walk in my
footsteps to that glory to which it has not been given me to
attain.”®®</p>
<p>It was attained by one of the major figures in the history of
music.</p>
<p>Claudio Monteverdi became an expert violinist in his native Cremona.
At twenty-two ( 1 589) he was made violinist to the Duke of Mantua; at
thirty- five he was maestro di cappella. Critics hotly denounced his
five books of madrigals (1587- 1605) for double discords, “licentious
modulations,” “il - legal” harmonic progressions, and broken rules of
counterpoint. “These new composers,” wrote Giovanni Artusi in Delle
imperfezioni della</p>
<p>musica moderna (1600- 3), “seem to be satisfied if they can produce
the greatest possible tonal disturbance by bringing together completely
un- related elements and mountainous collections of cacophonies.”®^</p>
<p>Turning his reckless hand to the new form that he had heard in
Florence, Monteverdi produced at Mantua his first opera, another Orfeo
(1607), with an enlarged orchestra of thirty-six pieces. The music and
action marked a great advance over Peri’s Euridice. In Monteverdi’s
second opera, Arianna (1608), the action was still more dramatic, the
music more appeal- ing; all Italy began to intone the deserted Ariadne’s
lament, “Lasciate mi morire“ (Let me die). In his expansion and
reorganization of the orchestra, in his leitmotiv signalization of each
character with a specific musical theme, in the overtures {sinfonie)
with which he prefaced his operas, in the improvement of recitatives and
arias, in the complex and intimate union of music and drama, Monteverdi
marked as decisive an advance in opera as his contemporary Shakespeare
was making in the theater.</p>
<p>In 1612 Monteverdi moved to Venice as maestro di cappella at
St. Mark’s.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>

<p>XHe composed more madrigals, but altered that declining form into
such declamation that critics accused him of subordinating music (as
Bernini would be accused of subordinating sculpture) to drama; and
unquestion- ably Monteverdi — like nearly all opera — is musical
baroque. In 1637 Venice opened the first public opera house, the Teatro
di San Cassiano; there Monteverdi’s A done ran from 1639 till Carnival
of 1640, while at times his Arianna was filling another theater. When he
produced his last opera, Uincoronazione di Poppea (1642), Italy was
happy to see that at the age of seventy-five Monteverdi (like Verdi with
Otello at seventy-four) was still in the fullness of his powers. A year
later he died, leaving the world of music inspired and rejuvenated by a
creative revolution.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to see the genius of Italy bubbling over in every
field, even in this period of supposed decline. In abundance and fervor
this was a fruitful age in the literature of Italy. Only a lack of time,
space, and knowledge keeps us from doing it justice here.</p>
<p>Italian scholarship naturally declined after the exhaustion of the
Renais- sance afflatus; one could not go on rediscovering Greece and
Rome for- ever. The care of letters was now left to literary academies,
whose very organization made them conservative. Almost every city in
Italy had such a society, dedicated to the cultivation of literature and
the mutual tolera- tion of poetry. The Accademia della Crusca (i.e., of
Chaff), founded in Florence in 1572, anticipated the French Academy by
compiling a dic- tionary of the language (i6i2f.) and attempting to
regulate literary style and taste.</p>
<p>Italian historians were the best of the age. We have noted Sarpi’s
pas - sionate History of the Council of Trent. Cardinal Guido
Bentivoglio pro- duced a remarkably sympathetic account of the revolt in
the Netherlands. He might have done more, but he died in conclave just
as he seemed about to be chosen pope — done to death, said Nicius
Erythraeus, by the snoring of a cardinal in the next cell, which
deprived him of sleep for eleven suc- cessive nights.®® Cardinal Caesar
Baronins compiled a massive history of the Church (Annales
ecclesiastici, 1588-1607) in twelve folio volumes, which later scholars
extended to thirty-eight; Ranke pronounced them quite free of charm,®®
but Gibbon found them helpful, and the Cardinal made a laud- ab le
effort to be fair. “I shall love with a special love,” he wrote, “the
man - took to do this, but desisted after writing an introductory
fragment of eight hundred folio pages.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>

<p>The theater prospered, while drama declined. Few memorable plays were
composed, but many were produced, and with a scenic lavishness and
histrionic skill that made Inigo Jones marvel and learn. Italian actors
were in demand throughout the Continent. While in England female parts
were taken by boys, in Italy they were played by women. Actresses were
already deified; Tasso indited a sonnet to Isabella Andreini, who was
not only a beautiful performer but a passable poetess and a good
wife.</p>
<p>Two plays stand out in this period, partly because they established a
new genre on the stage — the pastoral drama. Tasso gave it impetus with
his Aminta (1573); Giovanni Battista Guarini produced the classic
example in 11 pastor fido (1585). “If he had not read Aminta^’ said
Tasso, “he had not excelled it.”®® Cardinal Bellarmine rebuked Guarini
for the licentious - ness of the play, saying that it had done more harm
to Christendom than all the heresies of Luther and Calvin; however, a
sedulous search has found no saucier scene than the pretty Corisca
offering the “two apples” of her breast to the unappreciative Silvio, a
hunter who “takes more joy in one beast caught . . . than in the love of
all the nymphs that are.”® ® Barring Silvio, the play, like nearly all
the Italian poetry of the time, has a sensual temperature, fusing all
life into love. The action transpires in a pastoral Arcadia, in that
“fair Golden Age when milk was the only food,” no vice or grief stained
humanity, and love was free from all censures and chains.’^® What with
Aminta and this Faithful Shepherd, and Montemayor’s Diana enamorada, and
Sidney’s Arcadia, and Fletcher’s Faithful Shepherdess, half the reading
population of Europe was sent out to pasture.</p>
<p>Crescimbeni listed 661 sonneteers who in the Italy of the sixteenth
cen- tury had no trouble finding resonant rhymes for their variations
of</p>
<p>Petrarch.’^^ Some of the finest sonnets of the time were thrown off
by Campanella and Bruno as sparks from their philosophic fire.
Alessandro Tassoni satirized the sonneteers and the idolators of
Petrarch, Marini, and Tasso in one of the most famous of Italian poems.
La secchia rapita (The Stolen Bucket) . As its victim was a powerful
noble, no one would publish it; but the demand was so great that scribes
prospered by copying it and selling it at eight crowns per manuscript;
finally it was printed in France and smuggled into Italy. What charmed
Italian readers was not only the aptness and sharpness of the barbs, but
the episodes of pure poetry that interrupted the hilarity — the love
story of Endymion delicately told, almost side by side with the picture
of a senator traveling to heaven on a toilet stool.</p>
<p>Only two Italian poets surpassed Tassoni’s acclaim in this epoch —
^Tasso and Giovanni Battista Marini. Born at Naples and bred for the
law, Gio- vanni abandoned pleading for rhymes, and for a time enjoyed a
vagabond life. The Marquis Manso, forgiving the licentiousness of M

<p>258 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xgave him a room in his palace, where, at a respectful distance, the
youth could look upon the somber decaying Tasso. For helping a friend to
ab- duct a girl, he was thrown into prison. Released, he went to Rome,
where the genial Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandino made him his private
secretary. The Cardinal took him to Turin and there lost him to Charles
Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy. For a while Marini sipped the wine and vinegar
of court life. He made fun of a rival poet, Gasparo Murtola, who waylaid
him, shot at him, missed him, but wounded a servant of the Duke. Murtola
was sen- tenced to death; Marini had him pardoned, and won his rival’s
warmest in - gratitude. Imprisoned for satires too personally pointed,
Marini accepted an invitation from Marie de Medicis to adorn her court
at Paris (1615). The Italians in her retinue welcomed him as their voice
in France; he was idolized, and he received fat sinecures; lords and
ladies paid him well for pre-publication copies of his epic Adone. One
such copy reached Cardinal Bentivoglio, who appealed to Marini to purge
the poem of its lascivious passages; we do not know how far the author
tried. Adone was published in Paris in 1623, was put on the Index, and
became the rage and the theme of Italy. When Marini returned to Naples
(1624) highwaymen pelted his coach with roses, noblemen came out to
escort him, and beauties melted toward him from their balconies. A year
later he died, aged fifty-two, at the apex of his wealth and fame.</p>
<p>The Adone is an outstanding poem even in a country where poetry</p>
<p>is almost as congenital as song. Its size deters us — a thousand
pages, 45,000 lines. Its style indulges in all those tricks of speech
that delighted Lyly in England, Guevara and Gongora in Spain, and some
precietises ridicules of the Hotel de Rambouillet in France; marinismo
was part of a European plague. The clever Italian had an almost sensual
passion for words; he tossed them about in crackling antitheses,
fanciful conceits, artful circumlocu- tions, even facile puns. But the
Italian public of the sixteenth century, itself bubbling with hot
speech, took no offense from this love of the wiles and jugglery of
words. And what did such verbal conjuring matter in an</p>
<p>epic that was a paean to sex in all its forms — normal, bestial,
homosexual, incestuous? Here were the love myths of Hellas elegantly
told; Mars and Vulcan sport with Aphrodite, and Zeus seduces Ganymede.
The charms of the male body are the running theme, and the sense of
touch is praised as the astonishing source of man’s keenest delights.
The hero, Adonis, dowered with all the beauty of a girl, is courted by
women, men, and beasts. Venus woos him with her smoothest arts; a bandit
chief seeks to make him his mistress; at last the helplessly lovable lad
is mortally wounded in the groin by a boar with the most amorous
intentions. Was this effemi- nate concentration on sex a relief and
escape from too much religion and too much Spain?</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>TASSO</li>
</ol>
<p>Torquato Tasso had many inducements to poetry. He was born at Sor-
rento (1544), where the sea is an epic, the sky a lyric, and every hill
an ode. His father Bernardo was a poet, a courtier, a man of sensitivity
and passion, who plotted against the Viceroy, was banished from the
King- dom of Naples (1551), and wandered from court to court, leaving
wife and child impoverished behind him. Torquato’s mother, Porzia de’
Rossi, came of an old Tuscan family with culture in its blood. For three
years the boy studied in a Jesuit school at Naples. He imbibed Latin and
Greek in nerve-racking doses, and was trained to a profound piety that
gave him in alternation theological tremors and an indescribable peace.
At ten he joined his father in Rome; his mother’s death two years later
left him deeply moved and long disconsolate. He accompanied his father
to Urbino and Venice; there Bernardo published his own Amadigi (1560),
which set medieval romance into verse.</p>
<p>Torquato himself was now agitated with poetry. He was dispatched to
Padua to study law, but the father’s example w as more powerful than his
precepts; the youth neglected statutes, and concatenated rhymes. He had
long since fallen under Virgil’s spell; now he resolved to apply the Man
- tuan’s noble and serious style to those chivalric legends that Ariosto
had treated with a twinkle in his eye. So he surprised his father by
sending him Rinaldo, a romance in twelve cantos. Bernardo was saddened
and pleased; he foresaw the vicissitudes of a poet with nothing but
genius, yet he beamed to see his son, aged eighteen, rivaling in
delicacy and imaginative verse the best poets of the time. He had the
little epic published (1562), warmed his soul in the acclaim it
received, and allowed Torquato to abandon law at Padua for philosophy
and literature at Bologna. There the youth’s talent proved troublesome;
he wrote prickly epigrams upon his teachers, was threatened with a libel
suit, and returned precipitately to Padua.</p>
<p>Bernardo persuaded Cardinal Luigi d’Este, b rother to Duke Alfonso II
of Ferrara, to engage Torquato as secretary (1565). The poet gladly</p>
<p>joined a court then regarded as the finest flower of Italian culture.
There he found an environment alive with music, dancing, literature,
art, intrigue, and love. Two sisters of the Cardinal caught Tasso’s
fancy: Lucrezia, lofty, beautiful, and thirty-one, and Leonora,
twenty-nine, a pious invalid whose quarrels with Alfonso made her the
idol of the court. Legend (as in</p>
<p>Goethe’s drama and Byron’s Lament of Tasso) describes the poet as
falling in love with Leonora; certainly he addressed impassioned poems
to her, as custom demanded, and both ladies admitted him to a friendship
haloed with the aura of pedigree; but one sister was his senior by
eleven years, the</p>
<p>26 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XOther by nine, and neither seems ever to have given him anything
cozier than an ear. Tasso never married; he could love only princesses,
and they could marry only property. Perhaps, as diffident of his powers
as he was proud of his poetry, he feared the obligations and restraints
of marriage.</p>
<p>In 1569 his father died penniless; Tasso had to borrow to bury him. A
year later Cardinal d’Este took th e youth to Paris. Torquato was
shocked to find Charles IX associating amiably with Huguenot leaders; he
openly criticized the government for consorting with heretics. The
Cardinal, anxious to keep the favor of the King, sent his troublesome
secretary back to Italy; Tasso never forgave him.</p>
<p>Alfonso consoled the poet by attaching him to his own household with
an annual stipend and no responsibilities except to dedicate to the Duke
the epic that he was known to be writing about the First Crusade. These
years were relatively happy. In the summer of 1573 Tasso produced at the
court his pastoral drama Aminta^ and was heartened by its success. The
lords and ladies of Ferrara, who lived by exploiting the peasantry, were
thrilled to see the bliss of rustics — on the stage; and all the
gallants of the court re- joiced in the picture of a golden age when
everything pleasant was lawful and good.</p>

<p>That unwonted boldness of spirit left him when (1574) he found him-

culminating</p>

<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>effort of his life. If it failed, or if the Church condemned it as
licentious or heretical, he would never be happy again. Fearfully he
sent the manu- script to seven critics and asked their judgment on the
poem’s plot, charac - ters, diction, and morality. They passed so many
censures upon it that, not knowing how to please them all, he put the
poem aside. For five years it lay unpublished. The poet, conscious that
he had written a masterpiece, demanded too much of his critics, and of
life. He confessed that “he could not bear to live in a city where the
nobles did not yield him the first place, or at least admit him to
absolute equality.” This last he surely merited, but he added that he
“expected to be adored by friends, served by serving - men, caressed by
domestics, honored by masters, celebrated by poets, and poi nted out by
all.”^^ A party grew up at Ferrara that criticized his poetry, his
character, and his claims. He began to dream of softer berths in kinder
courts.</p>
<p>Physical and mental disturbances had shaken his nerves: malarial
fever, repeated headaches, the cumulative shocks of his father’s exile,
his mother’s death, his father’s dying destitution. Moreover,
theological doubts — of hell, of immortality, of Christ’s divinity —
darkened his mind with a sense of sin and drove him to frequent
confession and Communion.^® He was con- vinced that he had experienced
the power of black (Satanic) magic. He had horrible visions of the Last
Judgment and saw God driving the con- demned into everlasting fire.^® He
had delusions of persecution — suspected his servants of betraying his
secrets, believed that he had been denounced to the Inquisition, and
daily expected to be poisoned. He was a difficult guest.’^^</p>
<p>Alfonso dealt with him sympathetically, for, after all, the greatest
poem of the age was dedicated to him and gave half a canto (XVII) to
celebrat- ing his lineage. He excused the poet from attendance at court,
and sent him to the pleasant villa of Belriguardo for change and quiet.
But his patience was strained when he found that Tasso was secretly
negotiating with Francesco de’ Medici — ^Alfonso’s keenest rival and
enemy — with a view to acceptance as a pensioner at the Florentine
court. In November 1575 the poet left Ferrara, saying that he was going
to Rome to get the indulgence of the jubilee. He went, but visited
Florence twice en route. The Grand Duke did not take to him. Francesco
wrote to a friend (February 4, 1576), “I hardly know whether to call him
a mad, or an amusing and astute, spirit”; and a year later he decided
that “he did not want to have a mad - man at his court.”^* Tasso
returned sadly to Ferrara.</p>
<p>He asked Alfonso for the post of historiographer; he received it.
In</p>
<p>January 1577 he appeared before the Inquisition at Bologna and
confessed that he had sinfully entertained doubts of the Catholic faith;
the Inquisi- tion sent him back with words of comfort and good cheer. In
June of that year, while in the apartments of Lucrezia d’Este, he drew
his knife upon a</p>
<p>262 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. I</p>
<p>Xservant who had aroused his suspicion. Alfonso ordered the poet to
be con- fined in a room of the castle, but soon released him and took
him to Belriguardo. The Duke behaved, wrote Tasso, “almost as if he had
been a brother, and not as a sovereign.”’^® The poet asked to be sent to
the Monastery of San Francesco; Alfonso so ordered, and he recommended a
purge. Tasso submitted; but at the monastery he broke out into a frenzy,
charging that his wine had been doctored; the monks asked that he be
taken off their hands. Fie was returned to the ducal castle and put
under guard. He escaped, disguised himself as a peasant, and wandered on
foot and alone across the Apennines to the home of his sister Cornelia
in Sor- rento. She received him with loving tenderness.</p>
<p>He might have won some clarity and happiness there had he not worried
about the great poem, still unpublished, that he had left behind him in
Ferrara; and perhaps, long accustomed to court life, he missed the
comforts that had accompanied his tribulations. He went to Rome and
begged the Ferrarese ambassador to intercede for him with Alfonso. The
Duke sent money to take care of him and consented to his return, on
condition that he promise to be quiet and submit to medical treatment.
Arrived at Ferrara (1578), he was given a private apartment outside the
palace; a servant was provided, and meals were sent from the ducal
table. Tasso accepted seda- tives and purges obediently and continued to
write fine poetry. But he had hoped to be again a favorite at the court;
instead, nearly everyone treated him as a madman. Neither the Duke nor
the princesses any longer admitted him to their presence. The worst
insult of all was that Alfonso ordered the poet’s manuscripts, includin
g the Gerusalemme, to be taken from him, lest he destroy them.</p>
<p>In June 1578 Tasso again fled from Ferrara. He went to Mantua, Padua,
Venice, Urbino, Turin. There Duke Charles Emmanuel received him with
honors and gave him all the comforts he had known at Ferrara. But after
three months the restless poet, perhaps anxious to recover his
manuscripts, petitioned Alfonso to take him back. Alfonso agreed, and in
February 1579 Tasso was again lodged in the palace of Cardinal Luigi
d’Este. But Alfonso, longing for heirs, was being married for the third
time, and had no ear for poets; Tasso was not invited to the
festivities. For two weeks he bore neg- lect fretfully; then (March 12,
1579) he left the Cardinal’s quarters and broke into the Palace of the
Bentivogli, crying out against the Duke, the new Duchess, and the whole
court. He ran to the Castello, insisting on seeing the Duchess and
recovering his manuscripts. The Duke ordered him removed to the nearby
Sant’ Anna mental hospital. There he was con fined for over seven
years.</p>
<p>He was not entirely mad. He had lucid intervals, in which he
wrote</p>
<p>poetry and received friends; Montaigne claimed to have visited him.
Several</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>ladies of the court came to comfort him, and once Lucrezia took him
to her villa at Belvedere; but his violence frightened her, and she had
him sent back to the hospital. The broken mind was cast into
intermittent ter- ror by hallucinations of spectral voices heard, of
supernal spirits invading his room and stealing his poems.</p>
<p>Now, at last, his epic was published. Those who had possession of the
manuscript, learning that book pirates had copied it, sent it to the
printers (1580). The critics still found fault with it, but Italy
acceped it enthusi- astically, and Church authorities praised its theme
and piety. Edition fol- lowed upon edition; two thousand copies were
sold in a day; homes and courts echoed its melody. Men debated whether
Tasso should be ranked with Ariosto or Petrarch; Voltaire, with no
Christian prejudice, preferred the poem to The lliad^^ Elizabeth of
England, hearing parts of it trans- lated into Latin, envied the Duke of
Ferrara for having found a Homer to immortalize him.®^</p>
<p>If we prod our historic sense we can begin to understand why Europe
re- sponded so warmly to this stirring narrative of the First Crusade.
It was hailed as the long-awaited, sorely needed epic of Christendom.
For when Tasso commenced his poem Europe was amassing the fleet that met
the Turks at Lepanto; the great battle was fought while the poet wrote;
it was won, but the rapid recovery of the Turks was threatening Europe,
es- pecially Italy; Rome, the citadel of Christianity, was in danger as
the poem reached completion. The fear of Islam was then as pervasive in
Christendom as Europe’s dread today of a revitalized Orient. In that
atmosphere men and women read, in seductive verse, the heartening story
of how Godfrey of Bouillon, in 1099, had led a battered but triumphant
Christian host to the capture of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>So Tasso, remembering and challenging Virgil’s arma virumque cano^
proudly begins:</p>
<p>Canto Varme pietose, e 7 capitano</p>
<p>Che il gran sepolcro liberd di Cristo —</p>
<p>“I sing the pious arms, and the captain who freed the great sepulcher
of Christ.” He calls upon the Muse to inspire celestial ardors in his
breast, and dedicates his poem to ^’magnanimo Alfonso” for rescuing him
from the squalls of fortune and giving him a pleasant port. God sends
the Archangel Gabriel to bid Godfrey cease dallying and press on to
Jerusalem. As the Christians near the city, its Turkish governor,
Aladin, orders his men to transfer a statue of the Virgin from a
Christian church to a Moslem mosque, believing that the image will bring
victory to its possessor. The statue is recaptured and con- cealed by
Christians; Aladin decrees the massacre of all the remaining Chris-</p>
<p>264</p>

<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>Xtians in Jerusalem. The lovely maiden Sophronia offers herself as a
sacrifice for her people; she falsely tells Aladin that she has stolen
and burned the image; he condemns her to die at the stake. Her
unrequited lover Olindo seeks to die in her place and assumes the guilt;
they are both condemned to death, but they are rescued by the Moslem
heroine Clorinda. Pluto, god of the nether world, calls a council of his
followers to consider means of defeating the Christian besiegers. As
their instrument they choose the fair Armida, a Damascene damsel with
bewitching powers. Rinaldo and other knights are ensnared into her
enchanted garden, and Rinaldo relaxes in her arms. Tancred, the perfect
Christian knight, chivalrous and brave, admires Clorinda’s coura ge and
falls in love with her across the barriers of creed. In one of the
liveliest cantos (XII) of the poem Clorinda disguises herself and fights
Tancred to her death; dying, she begs him to christen her into his own
faith. Godfrey sends soldiers to f ind Rinaldo and the lost knights;
they discover Armida’s castle, turn away from the “naked beauties”
swimming in her pool, and free the captives. Angry at Rinaldo’s
desertion of her, Armida offers herself as prize to anyone who will kill
him. Tisiphernes takes the task, but Rinaldo pierces him through from
fore to aft. Armida proposes suicide, but Rinaldo dissuades her with
revived love; she consents to conversion and surrenders to him with the
Virgin’s phrase, ^^Ecco rancilla The Christians scale the</p>
<p>walls, slaughter the Moslem hosts, and give thanks to God. The story
does not go on to the incineration of the Jews.</p>
<p>Ariosto had smiled at the chivalric romance; Tasso revived it in
fullest gravity, adding medieval magic and marvels to the classical
machinery of intervening divinities. The Counter Reformation had for a
time repressed the lusty Italian sense of humor; a lack of humor
prepared Tasso for in- sanity. The cosmos must not be taken too
seriously. Tasso, in his epic, is faith unquestioned and sentiment
unrelieved. He adorns the poem with such conceits that Galileo compared

scenes, of Virgil in the visit to hell, of Ariosto in the amours, of
Virgil, Dante, and Petrarch in ideas and whole lines. The magic is
childish, the Amazons are absurd. The Gerusalemme may not be as majestic

<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>praise. He winced to read the strictures of some critics — that his
rhymes were too often jingles, his love scenes too sensuous, his Moslems
too admirable, his heroines too often like men. But the remainder of
Italy hailed him as Virgil reborn, and voices were raised demanding some
better treatment for the stricken poet. Those who visited him, however,
saw that he needed careful supervision, and that Alfonso was handling
the matter as considerately as could be expected of a man often
offended, and busy with government.</p>
<p>The condition of the poet improved. In July 1586 Vincenzo Gonzaga,
heir apparent to the duchy of Mantua, secured his release on a promise
to take care of him. For a month Tasso lived at Mantua; then he left it
for Bergamo, Modena, Bologna, Loreto, Rome, selling his poems and
praises to any who would pay. He was well received in Rome, but soon he
wandered away again, to Siena, to Florence, again to Mantua, again to
Naples, where Marquis Manso befriended him, and once more to Rome, where
Cardinals Cinzio and Aldobrandino housed him in their rooms in the
Vatican (1594). He wished to return to Ferrara to die there; Alfonso
refused to let him come. Pope Clement VIII assigned him a pension and
made plans to crown him poet laureate. But in April 1595 the worn-out
poet, old and infirm at fifty-one, had to be taken to the Monastery of
San Onofrio, in Rome, for better supervision. There, after one more out-
burst of passion, he died (April 25), m urmuring, “In manus tuas,
Domine.” The laurel wreath that he had never lived to wear was placed
upon his bier. The body was borne in procession to St. Peter’s and back
again, fol - lowed by the papal court and the nobles and scholars of
Rome; it was buried in the monastery church and was marked with a simple
epitaph: Hie jacet Torquatus Tassus. The cell he had occupied became a
goal of pilgrimage, as it is today.</p>

<li>THE COMING OF BAROQUE: I55O-1648</li>
</ol>
<p>Classical art — the Parthenon and its frieze, the sculptures of Myron
and Polyclitus, the Roman Forum, The Aeneid, the Vatican Stanze of
Raphael, the Medici Chapel figures of Michelangelo — had been the
reduction of chaos to order, of the manifold to unity, of movement to
stability, of feeling to thought, of the indiscriminate to the
significant, of the complex and obscure to the simple and clear; it was
matter forged into form. But even perfection palls when it is long
continued. Change is necessary to life, sensation, and thought; an
exciting novelty may seem by its very novelty to be beautiful, until the
forgotten old returns on the wheel of time and is embraced as young and
new. So the Renaissance drove Gothic out of</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XItaly as barbarous, until artists and patrons, irked by pretty
proportions and cramping symmetry, and laughing like cathedral gargoyles
at classic columns, architraves, and pediments, brought the Gothic
spirit back in the exuberant irregularities and elaborations of
baroque.*</p>
<p>Classical art had sought to reveal the objective, the impersonal, the
per- fect; baroque allowed the individual artist, even his passing
humor, to find embodiment in work that represented not so much an object
realistically portrayed (as in Dutch painting), but an impression or
feeling objectified through partly imaginary forms. So El Greco’s
elongations were not</p>
<p>Spain’s men but his own memories or moods; the tender Madonnas of
Murillo and Guido Reni were not the harassed mothers whom they knew but
the exemplary piety they had been asked to represent. Moreover, an Italy
that had felt the seismic shock of the Reformation, and that had been
stirred to fresh intensities of religious emotion by Loyola, Teresa,
Xavier, and Charles Borromeo — this post-Luther Italy could no longer
rest in the calm, proud peace of the classic ideal. It reaffirmed its
faith, displayed its symbols defiantly, adorned its shrines, and poured
into art a new warmth of color and sensibility, a fresh diversity and
incalculable freedom of structure and movement, released from classic
rule, restraint, and line. Art became the expression of feeling through
ornament, not the compression of thought into form.</p>
<p>Architecture was no longer Greek mathematics or Roman engineering, it
was music, sometimes opera, like the Opera in Paris. Designers and
builders turned from stability to fluidity and rhythm; they rejected a
static symmetry for deliberate disbalance and disunity; they willfully
carved or twisted columns and architraves; they were weary of plain
surfaces and heavy masses; they interrupted cornices, broke pediments in
two, and scattered sculpture at every turn. The sculptors themselves
were tired of perfect limbs, immobile features, the stiff frontal pose;
they placed their figures in unexpected attitudes, inviting the eye to
take diverse views; they introduced the effects of painting into
statuary, carving light and shade into the stone, movement into the
body, thought and feeling into the face. Painters left pure line, clear
light, and an innocuous serenity to Perugino, Correggio, and Raphael;
they bathed the world in color like Rubens, shaded it with mysticism
like Rembrandt, roused it into sensuality like Reni, or troubled it with
suffering and ecstasy like El Greco. The</p>
<p>woodworkers littered furniture with decoration, the metalworkers
turned their material into bizarre or humorous forms. When, in 1568, the
Jesuits engaged Vignola to design their church, II Gesu, in Rome, they
saw to it that it should gather all the arts into a profusion of
columns, statues, pic-</p>
<p>From the Portuguese barroco, an irregularly shaped shell often used
as decoration.</p>
<p>CHAP. IX) ALMA MATER ITALIA 267</p>
<p>tures, and precious metal, designed not to illustrate geometry, but
to in- spire and irradiate faith.</p>
<p>Because in art Italy still led Europe, the new style of ornament,
senti- ment, and expression passed not only into Catholic Spain,
Flanders, and France, but even into Protestant Germany, where it
achieved some of its gayest forms. Literature felt tlie baroque
influence in the extravagant word play of Marini, Gongora, and Lyly, in
the high-flown language</p>
<p>of Shakespeare, in A4arlowe’s Doctor Faustiis and Goethe’s Faust.
Opera is music baroquefied. The new style won no general victory. The
Dutch preferred a quiet realism to the excitements of baroque. Velazquez
at his best was classical or realist, and Cervantes, after a romantic
life, wrote Don Quixote with classic poise and calm. Corneille, Racine,
and Poussin were devotedly classical. But were the classics always
classical? Could anything be more baroque than the ugly struggling
Laocoon? History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into
theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our
generalizations, breaks all our rules. His- tory is baroque.</p>
<p>One powerful factor remained constant in Italian art: the Church was
still the most active and formative patron. There were, of course, other
patrons and influences: princely houses and cultured cardinals built
pri- vate palaces, and in ornament carried on some pagan themes; so
Odoardo Farnese had the Carracci paint for him The Triumph of Bacchus
and</p>
<p>The Rule of Love. But the Council of Trent and the Catholic
Reformation that followed it had set a sterner tone; nudes retired from
Italian art, and pious subjects no longer served as sensual vehicles.
Only the supplications of Roman artists dissuaded Pope Clement VIII from
completely covering Michelangelo’s Last Judgment, Daniele da Volterra’s
breeches and all. The Council had defended religious images against the
attacks of Hugue- nots and Puritans, but it had insisted that such
symbols should inspire wor- ship rather than stir the blood. Whereas the
reformers had discountenanced the adoration of Mary and the invocation
of saints, the painters and sculp- tors of Counter-Reformation Italy
told again, sometimes with crude real- ism, the sufferings of the
martyrs, and, with conscious sentiment, the story of the Virgin Mother
of God. The anxiety of the Church to depaganize art and to inculcate
doctrine and piety co-operated with the political and economic reverses
of Italy to make this age the last echo of the Renais- sance.</p>

<li>THE ARTS IN ROME</li>
</ol>
<p>Rome was still the art capital of the world. The great age of Roman
painting was over, and no Italian painter now could rival Rubens or
Rembrandt, but</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XRoman architecture prospered, and Bernini was for a generation the
most famous artist in Europe. Though Bologna had stolen the lead in
painting, the stars of that school came to Rome for their final
flourishing, and Vasari arrived in 1572 to fresco the Sala Regia of the
Vatican. Painters whom fond minorities still reverence peopled the
botteghe of Rome: Taddeo and Federigo Zuccaro, Girolamo Muziano,
Francesco de’ Salviati, Giovanni Lanfranco, Bartolommeo Manfredi,
Domenico Fetti, Andrea Sacchi. Most of these are usually classed as
“mannerists” — artists who imitated the manner of one or another of the
masters of the High Renaissance. We may include “mannerism” (1550 -1600)
as the first stage of baroque.</p>
<p>Federigo Zuccaro unfurled his colors in four nations. In Florence he
com- pleted the frescoes that Vasari had begun in the cathedral dome; in
Rome he painted the Capella Paolina of the Vatican; in Flanders he
designed a series of cartoons; in England he made famous portraits of
Queen Elizabeth and Mary Stuart; in Spain he shared in decorating the
Escorial; and back in Rome he founded the Academy of St. Luke, whose
organization suggested to Reynolds the English Royal Academy of Arts. Of
all Italian painters in that generation Zuccaro was in greatest demand,
but posterity has preferred Pietro Berrettini da Cortona. With
Renaissance versatility Pietro designed the Barberini and Pamfili
palaces in Rome, and painted, in the Pitti Palace at Florence, frescoes
crowded with fantastic figures in the full profusion of baroque.</p>
<p>The real master of Roman painting in this age was Michelangelo Merisi
da Caravaggio. He was a man of Cellinian spirit. Son of a Lombard stone-
mason, he studied in Milan, moved to Rome, enjoyed a dozen quarrels,
killed a friend in a duel, escaped from prison, fled to Malta, Catania,
and Syracuse, and died of sunstroke on a Sicilian shore at the age of
forty-four (1609). In the intervals he effected a near-revolution in the
mood and the technique of Italian painting. He liked violent contrasts
of light and shade, played such tricks as illuminating a scene from a
hidden hearth, modeled his figures with light, brought them out from a
dark background, and began the reign of the tenebrosi — Guercino,
Ribera, and Salvator Rosa — in Italy. Scorning the idealistic
sentimentality of the Bolognese painters, he startled the age with his
almost brutal realism. When he took religious subjects he made the
Apostles and the saints look like burly workers borrowed from the docks.
His Card Players (now in the Rothschild Collection in Paris) won him
international fame. His Musicians — three singers and a lovely lutanist
— gathered dirt for three centuries before it was found in a
north-of-England antique shop about 1935; it was sold to a surgeon for £
100 and was bought for 0,000 by the Metropolitan Museum of New York
(1952). The Church usually rejected Caravaggio’s religious pic -</p>
<p>tures as too plebeian and lacking in sublimity; today they are the
prizes of connoisseurs. Rube ns so admired the Italian’s Madonna del
Rosario that he collected 1,800 gulden among the artists of Antwerp to
buy it and</p>

<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>present it to the Church of St. Paul.®® The Supper at Emmaus (London)
is not as profound as Rembrandt’s, but it is a powerful rendering of
peasant figures. The Death of the Virgin (Louvre) — again a peasant
scene — was one of the pictures that established the school of
naturalisti in Italy and real- ists in Spain and the Netherlands. Too
often Caravaggio “stressed the melo- drama of violence and crudity; but
history, like oratory, seldom makes a point without exaggeration. An age
that had exhausted the themes of sentiment shuddered at these brawny
longshoremen, and then accepted them as an invigorating entry of
forgotten men into art. Ribera took up Caravaggio’s darkened brush and
equaled him; Rembrandt captured the chiaroscuro of the Italian and
bettered it; and even the painters of the nineteenth century felt that
stormy influence.</p>
<p>Architecture now saw both the advent and the zenith of baroque. Pope
after pope transmuted the sweat and pennies of the willing faithful into
the glory of Rome. Pius IV completed the Belvedere and other rooms in
the Vatican. Gregory XIII built the Collegio Romano and began the
Quirinal Palace — which in 1870 became the residence of the King.
Domenico Fontana, favorite architect of Sixtus V, designed the new
Lateran Palace, the Sistine Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria
Maggiore, and, in that chapel, the very baroque tomb of Pius V.
Meanwhile cardinals and nobles added new palaces to Rome (Giustiniani,
Lancelotti, Borghese, Barberini, Rospigliosi) and new villas (Pamfili,
Borghese, Medici). Destruction went on, too; in this period Paul V
demolished the Baths of Constantine, which had survived, almost in-
tact, since the first Christian Emperor.</p>
<p>Good architects were plentiful. There was Giacomo della Porta, who
ably completed several buildings left unfinished by his master, Vignola,
like the facade of II Gesu and the cupola of St. Peter’s; in that same
immensity he designed the majestic Cappella Gregoriana; he gave the
final touches to the Palazzo Farnese, which Michelangelo had begun; and
to him are due two of the magnificent fountains that give Rome the
freshness of eternal youth. The loveliest of the fountains is the
Fontana delle Tartarughe (tortoises), which Taddeo Lundini set up before
the Palazzo Mattel. Martino Lunghi the Elder shared with della Porta in
raising from Michelangelo’s sketches the Palazzo de’</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. I</p>
<p>XThe Church of Jesus — II Gesu — was planned (1568) by Giacomo da
Vignola to meet the desire of the Jesuits for an architecture whose
magni- ficence would awe, inspire, and uplift the worshiper. The
architect and his successors designed a spacious nave without aisles,
with ornate pillars, spandrels, capitals, and cornices; an imposing
altar, a luminous cupola, and brilliant decoration with pictures,
statuary, marble, silver, and gold; and in 1700 Andrea del Pozzo,
himself a Jesuit, added the noble tomb and altar of St. Ignatius. The
Jesuit attitude to life differed from that of</p>
<p>some other Catholic churchmen, and was at opposite pole to the
Puritan view; art was to be chastened of secular sensuality, but it was
to be wel- comed in the adornment of life and faith. However, there was
no specific “Jesuit style.” II Gesu was baroque petrified, and many
Jesuit churches, especially in Germany, were baroque, but each church
followed local and current forms and moods.</p>
<p>The final achievement of Roman art w as the completion of
St. Peter’s. Michelangelo had left a model of the dome, but the drum
alone had been laid when Sixtus V came to the papacy. The drum was 138
feet in diameter. Only Brunelleschi, at Florence, had dared to cover so
great an area without intervening supports. Architects and engineers
quailed before the task proposed by Buonarotti; financiers moaned that
it would take a million ducats and ten years’ time. Sixtus ordered the
work to pro - ceed, hoping to celebrate Mass under the new dome before
he died. Giacomo della Porta took charge, with Domenico Fontana as his
aide. Eight hundred men labored night or day, Sundays excepted, from
March 1589 till, on May 21, 1590, three months before th e doughty
pontiff’s death, Rome was informed that “to his everlasting glory, and
the shame of his predecessors, our holy Pope Sixtus V has completed the
vaulting of the dome of St. Peter’s.”®*</p>
<p>The effect of the dome, except from a distance, was diminished by the
baroque fagade that Maderna set up in 1607-14. The church itself was
finally consecrated in 1626, 174 years after its first planning. In 1633
Bernini cast in bronze the gaudy baldacchino, or canopy, over the “tomb
of St. Peter” and the high altar. The great sculptor redeemed himself by
enclosing the approach to the shrine in a massive elliptical colonnade
(1655- 67) that helps to make St. Peter’s the most sublime building on
earth, as its dome is the crowning achievement of modern art.</p>
<p>X. BERNINI</p>
<p>Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini summed up in one dominating life (1598-</p>
<ol start="1680" type="1">
<li>the art of seventeenth-century Rome. From his Florentine father,
a</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>sculptor, he learned his art; from his Neapolitan mother he may have
derived his emotional intensity and ardent faith. In 1605 the father was
summoned to Rome to work on the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. There
“Gian” grew up in an atmosphere of classi c statuary and Jesuit piety.
He was thrilled by the Vatican Antinous and the Apollo Belvedere; but he
was more deeply moved by the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, which
he practiced till he felt the terror and devotion of one who had
experienced the pains of hell and the love of Christ. Every day he</p>
<p>heard Mass; twice a week he took the Sacrament.</p>
<p>He tried his hand at painting, even to producing a hundred pictures.
Of these the Sts. Andrew and Thomas in the Barberini Collection at Rome
has won most praise, though we might prefer the self-portrait in the
Uffizi Gallery — a dark, handsome youth tending to melancholy
meditation. He did better in architecture. For Maffeo Barberini he
completed the Barberini Palace; and when this patron became Pope Urban
VIII, Bernini, aged thirty- one, was appointed chief architect of
St. Peter’s. There, besides the colonnade and the baldacchino, he built
in the apse the ornate Cathedra Petri, enshrining the wooden chair which
the faithful believed to have been used by the Apostle; around it he
grouped four powerful figures of Church Fathers; and over the whole
bizarre structure he scattered angelic statuary with the abandon of a
man who had a mint of masterpieces in his brain. Near it he placed a
massive tomb for his beloved Urban VIII. He designed the balconies, and
many of the statues adorning the piers that support the dome. Under the
dome he placed a monumental figure of St. Longinus, and in the right
aisle he raised a lavish memorial to Countess Matilda of Tuscany.
Outside the church, in a chaster style, he remodeled the Scala Regia,
which leads up past stately columns to the Vatican</p>
<p>Palace, and in an alcove of this Royal Stairway he set up an
equestrian statue of Constantine seeing in the sky his summons to
Christianity; the emotionalism of this figure set a pattern for the
baroque age. Toward the end of his life he built in the Chapel of the
Sacrament in St. Peter’s an altar whose brilliant marbles and crowning
ciborium, temple, cupola, and angels rapt in adoration seemed to him not
too gorgeous an embodiment for the Eucharistic mystery of the Alass. All
this work in and around</p>
<p>St. Peter’s impresses a modern artist as theatrical excess and a
specious ap - peal to the senses; to Bernini it seemed the exuberant
vehicle of an ecstatic and communicable faith.</p>
<p>Everywhere he mingled architecture and statuary. He dreamed of an art
that would unite architecture, sculpture, and painting into one soul-
stirring ensemble. In the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria he
brought together precious marbles — green, blue, and red — and loosed
his decor- ative fancy to build the Cornaro Chapel, with fluted pillars
and graceful</p>
<p>272 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. I</p>
<p>XCorinthian columns; there he placed one of his most arresting and
emo- tional sculptures: St. Teresa, limp and unconscious in an ecstatic
trance, with a delectable seraph preparing to pierce her heart with a
flaming arrow, a symbol of the saint’s union with Christ. The seemingly
lifeless figure of Teresa is one of the triumphs of Italian baroque, and
the darting angel is a song in stone.</p>
<p>Bernini had some rivals. Montaigne was strongly impressed by Gia-</p>
<p>como della Porta’s statue of Justice on the tomb of Paul III in
St. Peter’s. Torrigiano cast a powerful and realistic bust of Sixtus V,
now in the</p>
<p>Victoria and Albert Museum. Borromini, like Bernini, mingled
sculpture with architecture, as in the tomb of Cardinal Villamarino in
the Church of Santi Apostoli in Naples. Alessandro Algardi equaled
Bernini in carving three figures for the tomb of Leo XI in St. Peter’s,
and surpassed him in sculptural relief with the alto relievo of The
Meeting of Pope Leo I and Att ila, also in St. Peter’s; and Algardi’s
bust of Innocent X in the Palazzo Doria Pamfili is more satisfying than
Bernini’s, and almost as powerful as Velazquez’ portrait. But no one in
this age matched Bernini in artistic fertility, imagination, and total
achievement.</p>
<p>He delighted Rome with bizarre fountains: the Fontana del Tritone,
the Fontana dei Fiumi — where minor sculptors carved four figures
represent- ing the Danube, the Nile, the Ganges, and the Plata. From
competitive plans submitted for th is fountain, Innocent X chose
Bernini’s, saying, “One must not look at his designs unless one is
prepared to adopt them.”®^ Bernini’s flair for sumptuous sepulchral
monuments must have given his patrons some pleasant anticipations of
death. Urban VIII lived long enough to see the tomb in St. Peter’s that
was prepared for his remains.</p>
<p>Cardinal Scipione Borghese rivaled Urban in giving Bernini scudi and
tasks. For him the sculptor made the vivid Rape of Proserpine, a dream
of masculine muscles and feminine contours; David slinging his shot at
Goliath; and Apollo and Daphne — too ideal a representation of male and
female youth. These figures (now all in the Borghese Gallery) brought
upon Bernini the charge of mannerism and theatrical exaggeration. The
Cardinal himself was transmitted to us in two busts, the personification
of good nature and good appetite. Naturally more attractive is the bust
of the lovely Constanza Buonarelli in the Museo Nazionale at Florence;
she wa s the wife of Bernini’s aide, but Bernini, said his son, made her
into stone while hotly enamored of her flesh — fieramente
innainorato?^</p>
<p>More than any other artist, Bernini illustrates the faults of
baroque. He made too obvious an appeal to emotion. He mistook the
theatrical for the dramatic, prettiness for beauty, sentiment for
sympathy, size for grandeur. He appropriated to sculpture the intense
facial expression usually a privilege of painting. By too meticulous a
realism of detail he sometimes dulled the psychological impact of his
work. He rarely achieved in his</p>
<p>CHAP. IX)</p>
<p>ALMA MATER ITALIA</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>figures the repose that gives a timeless quality to the sculptures of
Periclean Athens. But why must a statue always express repose? Why
should not the movement, feeling, and zest of life invade and animate
marble and bronze? It is a virtue, not a fault, in baroque sculpture
that it made stone feel and speak. Bernini observed the Horatian precept
and felt what he expressed — the smooth texture of a girl’s skin, the
agile vitality of youth, the cares and labors of leaders, the piety and
ecstasy of saints.</p>
<p>For almost fifty years he was accepted as the greatest architect of
his age. In 1665, when Colbert and Louis XIV proposed to remodel and
extend the Louvre, they invited Bernini to come to Paris and undertake
the task. He came, and designed not wisely but too well — too grandly
for French taste and funds. Perrault’s severer fa gade was preferred,
and Bernini re- turned to Rome a disappointed man. Now (1667) he made
his re-</p>
<p>markable chalk drawing of himself, at present in Windsor Castle —
white locks receding over a powerful head, a face lined and gnarled with
work, the once gentle eyes become hard and fearful, as if seeing whither
the paths of glory lead. But he was not yet defeated; for thirteen more
years he built and carved con furia, “sharp in spirit, resolute in his
work, ardent in his wrath.”®* When his fire flickere d out (November 28,
1680), he had outlived the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>Milton, visiting Italy in 1638, reported that Italian scholars
themselves felt that the glory of their country had departed with the
coming of</p>
<p>Spanish dominance and the Counter Reformation. Probably subjection
and censorship had injured the mind and art of Italy — though Cervantes,
Calderon, and Velazquez were flourishing under a severer Inquisition in
Spain. But it was a Portuguese mariner, not a Spanish general or an
Index Expurgatorius, that ended the Italian Renaissance. Vasco da Gama
had found an all-water route to India, a long route, but cheaper than
the Venetian and Genoese trade avenues that had made Italy rich.
Portuguese and Dutch commerce was supplanting Italian; Flemish and
English textiles were taking markets from tlie Florentines. And the
Reformation had cut in half the flow of German and English gold to
Rome.</p>
<p>Italy shone in her decline. Art had fallen from the heights of
Raphael and Michelangelo, political thought had lost the depth and
courage of Machiavelli. But there was no decline, there was a rise, in
statesmanship from Leo X to Sixtus V, there was a rise in science from
Leonardo to</p>
<p>Galileo, in philosophy from Pomponazzi to Bruno, in the music drama
from Politian to Alonteverdi, only a debatable decline in poetry from
Ariosto to Tasso. Meanwhile, like a nourishing mother, Italy was pouring
her art and music, her science and philosophy, her poetry and prose,
over the Alps to France and Flanders, over the Channel to England, and
over the sea to Spain.</p>
