<h4 id="chapter-viii">CHAPTER VIII</h4>
<p>Tuscany and Umbria</p>
<p>I. PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA</p>
<p>I F now we cross back into Tuscany, we find that Florence, like
another Paris, absorbed the talents of her dependencies, and left only
here and there among them a figure that bids us pause in our pilgrimage.
Lucca bought a charter of autonomy from the Emperor Charles IV (1369),
and managed to remain a free city till Napoleon. The Lucchesi were
properly proud of their eleventh-century cathedral; they kept it in form
with re- peated restorations, and made it a veritable museum of art.
There eye and soul may still feast on the lovely stalls (1452) and
stained glass (1485) of the choir; on a noble tomb by Iacopo della
Quercia (1406); on one of Fra Bartolommeo’s profoundest pictures —
Madonna with St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist (1509); and on one
handsome work after another by Lucca’s own son, Matteo Civitali.</p>
<p>Pistoia preferred Florence to freedom. The conflict of “Whites”
and</p>
<p>“Blacks” so disordered the city that the government appealed to the
Florentine Signory to take over its management (1306). Thereafter
Pistoia received its art as well as its laws from Florence. For the
Ospedale del Ceppo — named from the hollow stump into which one might
drop con- tributions for the hospital — Giovanni della Robbia and some
aides designed (1514-25) a frieze of gleaming terra-cotta reliefs of the
Seven Works of Mercy: clothing the naked, feeding the hungry, nursing
the sick, visiting prisons, receiving strangers, burying the dead, and
comforting the bereaved. Here religion was at its best.</p>
<p>Pisa, once so rich that it could transform mountains of marble into a
cathedral, baptistery, and Leaning Tower, had owed its wealth to its
strategic position at the mouth of the Arno. For that reason Florence
beat it into subjection (1405). Pisa never reconciled itself to this
servitude; it rebelled again and again. In 1431 the Florentine Signory
expelled from Pisa all males capable of bearing arms, and kept their
women and children as hostages for their good behavior. 1 Pisa took
advantage of the French invasion (1495) to reassert its independence;
for fourteen years it fought off the Florentine mercenaries; finally,
after a fanatically heroic resistance,</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>2 3 0</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>it succumbed. Many leading families, choosing exile rather than
vassalage, migrated to France or Switzerland — among them the Sismondi
ancestors of the historian who in 1838 wrote an eloquent account of
these events in his History of the Italian Republics. Florence tried to
atone for her despotism by financing the University of Pisa, and sending
her artists to adorn the cathedral and the Campo Santo; but not even the
famous frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli in that Holy Field of the dead could
comfort a city</p>
<p>geologically doomed to decay. For the detritus of the Arno gradually
and mercilessly advanced the shore line, creating a new port at Livorno
— Leghorn — six miles away; and Pisa lost the commercial situation that
had made its fortune and its tragedy.</p>
<p>San Gimignano took its name from St. Geminian, who saved the
incipient village from the hordes of Attila about 450. It rose to some
prosperity in the fourteenth century; but its rich families divided into
murderous fac- tions, and built the fifty-six fortress towers (now
reduced to thirteen) that gave the town its fame as San Gimignano delle
Belle Torri. In 1353 the strife grew so violent that the city accepted
with resigned relief its ab- sorption into the Florentine dominion.
Thereafter life seems to have gone out of it. Domenico Ghirlandaio made
the Santa Fina Chapel of the</p>
<p>Collegiata famous with his finest frescoes, and Benozzo Gozzoli
rivaled his Medici Chapel cavalcades with scenes from the life of
St. Augustine in the church of Sant’ Agostino, and Benedetto da Maiano
carved superb altars for those shrines. But commerce took other routes,
industry starved, stimulus died; San Gimignano remained becalmed in her
narrow streets and disintegrating towers; and in 1928 Italy made the
city a national monu- ment, preserved as a half-living picture of
medieval life.</p>
<p>Forty miles up the Arno from Florence, Arezzo was a vital spot in the
web of Florentine defense and trade. The Signory itched and angled to
control it; in 1384 Florence bought the city from the duke of Anjou;</p>
<p>Arezzo never forgot the indignity. It gave birthf to Petrarch,
Aretino, and Vasari, but failed to hold them, for its soul still
belonged to the Middle Ages. Luca Spinello, also called Aretino, went
from Arezzo to paint in the Campo Santo at Pisa lively frescoes stirring
with the shock of battle</p>
<p>(1390-2), but also portraying Christ and Mary and the saints with an
in- tense and moving piety. If we wish to believe Vasari, Luca portrayed
Satan so repulsively that the Devil appeared to him in a dream and
reprimanded him with such violence that Luca died of fright — at
ninety-two. 2</p>
<p>Northeast of Arezzo, on the upper Tiber, the town of Borgo San</p>
<p>Sepolcro seemed too small to have and to hold an artist of high
rank.</p>
<p>TUSCANY AND UMBRIA</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>CHAP. VIII )</p>
<p>Piero di Benedetto was called della Francesca after his mother; for
she, left pregnant with him after his father’s death, reared him
lovingly, and guided and aided him to an education in mathematics and
art. Though we know that he was born in the Town of the Holy Sepulcher,
the earliest notice of him places him in Florence in 1439. That was the
year in which Cosimo brought the Council of Ferrara to Florence;
presumably Piero saw the gorgeous costumes of the Byzantine prelates and
princes who had come to negotiate the reunion of the Greek with the
Roman Church. We may more confidently presume that he studied the
frescoes of Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel; this was routine for any
art student in Florence. The dignity, power, and resolute perspective of
Masaccio mingled in Piero’s art with the picturesque grandeur and
majestic beards of the Eastern poten- tates.</p>
<p>When he returned to Borgo (1442) Piero was elected, aged thirty-six,
to the town council. Three years later he received his first recorded
com- mission: to paint a Madonna della Misericordia for the church of
San Francesco. It is still preserved in the Palazzo Comunale: a strange
as- semblage of somber saints, a semi-Chinese Virgin enfolding eight
praying figures in the robe of her mercy, a stiff Archangel Gabriel
making a very formal announcement of her motherhood to Mary, an almost
peasant Christ in a grimly realistic Crucifixion , and vivid forms of
the Mater Dolorosa and the Apostle John. This is half-primitive
painting, but powerful: no pretty sentiment, no delicate decoration, no
idealized refinement of the tragic tale; but bodies soiled and consumed
with the struggle of life, and yet rising to nobility in the silence of
their suffering, their prayers, and their forgive- ness.</p>
<p>His fame now spread through Italy, and Piero was in demand. At Fer-
rara (1449?) he painted murals in the Ducal Palace. Rogier van der</p>
<p>Weyden was then court painter there; probably Piero learned from him
something of the new technique of painting with pigments mixed in oil.
At Rimini (1451) he pictured Sigismondo Alalatesta — tyrant, murderer,
and patron of art — in an attitude of pious prayer, redeemed by the
presence of two magnificent dogs. In Arezzo, at intervals between 1452
and 1464, Piero painted for the church of San Francesco a series of
frescoes that mark the zenith of his art. They told mainly the story of
the True Cross, culminating in its capture by Khosru II, and its
recovery and restoration to Jerusalem by the Emperor Heraclius; but they
found place also for such episodes as the death of Adam, the Queen of
Sheba’s visit to Solomon, and the victory of Constantine over Adaxentius
at the Milvian Bridge. The</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>emaciated figure of the dying Adam, the worn face and drooping
breasts of Eve, the powerful bodies of their sons and their almost
equally virile daughters, the flowing majesty of the Que en of Sheba’s
retinue, the pro - found and disillusioned face of Solomon, the
startling incidence of light in The Dream of Constantine , the
fascinating turmoil of men and horses in The Victory of Heraclius —
these are among the most impressive frescoes of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Probably in the interludes of this major effort Piero painted an
altar- piece at Perugia, and some murals in the Vatican — later
whitewashed to make more space for Raphael’s conquering brush. At Urbino
in 1469 he produced his most famous picture — the arresting profile of
Duke Federigo da Montefeltro. Federigo’s nose had been broken, and his
right cheek scarred, in a tournament. Piero showed the left side, intact
but hilly with moles, and portrayed the crooked nose with dauntless
realism; he made the firm lips and half-closed eyes and sober face
reveal the administrator, the stoic, the man who has plumbed the
shallowness of wealth and power; we miss, however, in these features,
the refinement of taste that guided Federigo in organizing music at his
court and collecting his celebrated library of classical and illuminated
manuscripts. Paired with this portrait in the Uffizi diptych is a
profile of Federigo’s wife, Battista Sforza— a face almost Dutch, and
pale to sallowness — against a background of fields, hills, sky, and
battlemented walls. On the obverse of the portraits Piero painted two
“triumphs”— one chariot drawing Federigo, the other Battista, in solemn
state; both elegantly absurd.</p>
<p>About 1480 Piero, now sixty-four, began to suffer from eye trouble.
Vasari thought he became blind, but apparently he could still draw well.
In those declining years he wrote a manual of perspective, and a
treatise De quinque corporibus regolaribus, in which he analyzed the
geometrical relations and proportions involved in painting. His pupil
Luca Pacioli adopted Piero’s ideas in his own book De divina
proportione; and perhaps through this mediation Piero’s mathematical
ideas influenced Lei nardo’s studies in the geometry of art.</p>
<p>The world has forgotten Piero’s books and has rediscovered his
paincings. When we place him in time, and note that his work was
completed when Leonardo’s had just begun, we must assign him a rank with
the leading Italian painters of the fifteenth century. His figures seem
crude, their faces coarse; many seem cast in a Flemish mold. What
ennobles them is thur quiet dignity, their grave mien and stately
carriage, the restrained and yt dramatic force of their action. What
transfigures them is the harmonious</p>
<p>TUSCANY AND UMBRIA</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>flow of the design, and, above all, the uncompromising faithfulness
with which Piero’s hand, disdaining idealization and sentimentality, has
repre - sented what his eye has seen and his mind has conceived.</p>
<p>He lived too far from the intense centers of the Renaissance to
attain the potential perfection, or to exert the full influence, of his
art. Never- theless he numbered Signorelli among his pupils, and shared
in forming Luca’s style. It was Raphael’ s father who invited Piero to
Urbino; and though this was fourteen years before Raphael’s birth, that
blessed youth must have seen and studied the paintings left by Piero
there and in Perugia. Melozzo da Forli learned from Piero something of
strength and grace in design; and Melozzo’s angel musicians in the
Vatican recall those which Piero painted in one of his final works — the
Nativity of the London Na- tional Gallery — even as Piero’s angel
choristers recall Luca della Robbia’s Cantoria. So men hand down to
their successors their heritage — their lore and codes and skills; and
transmission becomes half the technique of civili- zation.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>SIGNORELLI</li>
</ol>
<p>When Piero della Francesca was painting his masterpieces at Arezzo,
Lazzaro Vasari, great-grandfather of the historian, invited a young art
student, Luca Signorelli, to come and live in the Vasari home and study
with Piero. Luca had first seen the light at Cortona, some fourteen
miles southeast of Arezzo (1441). He was only eleven when Piero came,
but he was twenty-four when Piero finished. In the interval the youth,
taking with passion to the painter’s art, learned from Piero to draw the
nude body with merciless veracity — with a stern rigor that went back to
his teacher, and a masculine force that pointed forward to Michelangelo.
In the studio and the hospitals, under the gibbet and in the cemeteries,
he sought the human body, as naked as he could find it; and he asked of
it not beauty but strength. He seems to have cared for nothing else; if
he painted any- thing else it was by impatient concession; and then, as
often as not, he would use nude figures for incidental ornament. Like
Michelangelo he was not at home (if we may speak so carelessly) with
female nudes; he drew them with scant success; and among males he
preferred not the young and fair, as Leonardo did and Sodoma, but the
middle-aged man in the full development of musculature and virility.</p>
<p>Carrying this passion with him, Signorelli moved about among the
cities of central Italy depositing nudes. After some early works in
Arezzo and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>*34</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>San Sepolcro he moved on to Florence (c. 1475), and there painted,
and presented to Lorenzo, The School of Pan, a canvas crowded with naked
pagan gods. Probably for Lorenzo he painted the Virgin and Child now in
the Uffizi: the Virgin ample but beautiful, the background largely com-
posed of naked men; here Michelangelo would find a hint for his Doni
Holy Family.</p>
<p>And yet this carnal pagan could paint piously. The Virgin in his
Uffizi Holy Family is one of the fairest figures in Renaissance art. At
the behest of Pope Sixtus IV he went to Loreto ( c . 1479), and adorned
the sanctuary of Santa Maria with excellent frescoes of the evangelists
and other saints. Three years later we find him in Rome contributing to
the Sistine Chapel a scene from the life of Moses — admirable in its
male figures, ungainly in its women. Called to Perugia (1484), he
painted some minor frescoes in the cathedral. Thenceforth he seems to
have made Cortona his home, pro- ducing pictures there for delivery
elsewhere, and leaving it chiefly for major assignments in Siena,
Orvieto, and Rome. In the cloister of the monastery of Monte Oliveto at
Chiusuri, near Siena, he depicted scenes from the life of St. Benedict.
For the church of Sant’ Agostino in Siena he completed an altarpiece
which was ranked among his best works; only the wings remain. For the
palace of the Sienese dictator, Pandolfo Petrucci, he painted episodes
from classic history or legend. Then he passed on to Orvieto for his
culminating achievement.</p>
<p>The cathedral council there had waited in vain for Perugino to come
and decorate the chapel of San Brizio. It had considered and rejected
Pinturic- chio. Now (1499) it summoned Signorelli, and bade him complete
the work that Fra Angelico had begun in that chapel half a century
before. It was the favorite altar in the great cathedral, for over it
hung an old pic- ture of the Madonna di San Brizio, who (the people
liked to believe) could ease the pains of childbirth, keep lovers and
husbands faithful, ward off the ague, and quiet a storm. Under the
ceiling frescoes where Fra Angelico had pictured the Last Judgment in
the full spirit of medieval hopes and fears, Signorelli painted similar
themes — Antichrist, The End of the World, The Resurrection of the Dead,
Paradise, and The Descent of the Damned Into Hell. But these old themes
were for him merely a frame wherein to show the naked bodies of men and
women in a hundred different attitudes, and in a hundred varieties of
joy and pain. Not until Michelangelo’s Last Judgment would the
Renaissance see again such an orgy of human flesh. Bodies handsome or
deformed, faces bestial or celestial, the grimaces of devils, the agony
of the condemned sprayed by jets of fire, the torturing of</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>TUSCANY AND UMBRIA</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>one sinner by breaking his teeth and his thighbone with a club — did
Signorelli delight in these scenes, or was he instructed to paint them
as en- couragement to piety? In any case he pictured himself (in a
corner of the Antichrist ) looking upon the melee with the equanimity of
the saved.</p>
<p>After spending three years on these frescoes, Signorelli returned
to</p>
<p>Cortona, and painted a Dead Christ for the church of Santa
Margherita. It was about this time that tragedy overtook him in the
violent death of his favorite son. When the corpse was brought to him,
says Vasari, “he caused it to be stripped, and with extraordinary
fortitude, without shedding a tear, he made a drawing of the body, so
that he might always behold in this work of his hands what Nature had
given him and cruel Fortune had taken away.” 3</p>
<p>In 1508 a different misfortune came. With Perugino, Pinturicchio, and
Sodoma he was commissioned by Julius II to decorate the papal chambers
in the Vatican. While their labors were progressing Raphael arrived, and
so pleased the Pope with his initial frescoes that Julius turned over
all the rooms to him, and dismissed the other artists. Signorelli was
then sixty- seven, and perhaps his hand had lost its skill or
steadiness. Nevertheless, eleven years later, he painted with success
and acclaim an altarpiece com- missioned by the Company of San Girolamo
at Arezzo; when it was</p>
<p>finished the brothers of the Company came to Cortona and carried this
Madonna and Saints on their shoulders all the way to Arezzo. Signorelli
accompanied them, and again lodged in the house of the Vasari. There
Giorgio Vasari, a lad of eight, saw him, and received from him long-</p>
<p>remembered words of encouragement in the study of art. Once a youth
of impetuous passion, Signorelli was now a kindly old gentleman, nearing
eighty, living in moderate prosperity in his native town, and honored by
all. At the age of eighty-three he was elected for the last time to the
governing council of Cortona. In that year, 1 524, he died.</p>
<p>Excellent scholars 4 have thought that Signorelli’s fame is
inadequate to his deserts; but perhaps it exceeds them. He was a facile
draftsman, who amazes us with his studies of anatomy, posture,
perspective, and fore- shortening, and amuses us with his use of human
figures in composition and ornament. Sometimes in his Madonnas he
reaches a note of tenderness, and the musician angels at Loreto have
charmed discriminating minds. But for the rest he was the apostle of the
body as anatomy; he gave it no sensual softness, no voluptuous grace, no
glory of color, no magic of light and shade; he seldom realized that the
function of the body is to be the outward expression and instrument of a
subtle and intangible spirit or character, and</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>that the sovereign task of art is to find and reveal that soul
through its veil of flesh. Michelangelo took from Signorelli this
idolatry of anatomy, this loss of the end in the means, and in the Last
Judgment of the Sistine Chapel he repeated on a larger scale the
physiological frenzy of the Orvieto frescoes; but on the ceiling of that
same chapel, and in his sculpture, he used the body as the voice of the
soul. In Signorelli painting passed at one step from the terrors and
tenderness of medieval art to the strained and soulless exaggerations of
baroque.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>SIENA AND SODOMA</li>
</ol>
<p>In the fourteenth century Siena had almost kept pace with Florence in
commerce, government, and art. In the fifteenth she exhausted herself
with such fanatical factional violence as no other city in Europe could
match. Five parties — monti, hills, the Sienese called them — ruled the
city in turn; each in turn was overthrown by revolution, and its more
influential members, sometimes numbering thousands, were exiled. We may
judge the bitterness of this strife from the oath that two of the
factions swore to end it (1494). An awed eyewitness describes them as
gathering solemnly at dead of night, in separate aisles, in their vast
and dimly lit cathedral.</p>
<p>The conditions of the peace were read, which took up eight pages,</p>
<p>together with an oath of the most horrible sort, full of
maledictions, imprecations, excommunications, invocations of evil,
confiscations</p>
<p>of goods, and so many other woes that to hear it was a terror; even
in the hour of death no sacrament should save, but should rather add to
the damnation of, those who should break the conditions; so that I . . .
believe that never was made or heard a more awful or horrible oath. Then
the notaries, on either side of the altar, wrote down the</p>
<p>names of all the citizens, who swore upon the crucifix, of which</p>
<p>there was one on each side; and every couple of the one or other</p>
<p>faction kissed, and the church bells rang, and Te Deum laudamus</p>
<p>was sung with the organs and the choir while the oath was being</p>
<p>sworn. 5</p>
<p>From this turmoil a dominant family emerged, the Petrucci. In 1497
Pandolfo Petrucci made himself dictator, took the title il Magnifico,
and proposed to give Siena the order, peace, and gentlemanly autocracy
that had been the fortune of Florence under the Medici. Pandolfo was
clever, and always landed on his feet after any crisis, even eluding the
vengeance of Caesar Borgia; he patronized art with some discrimination;
but he so</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 237</p>
<p>often resorted to secret assassination that his death (1512) was
celebrated with universal acclaim. In 1525 the desperate city paid the
Emperor Charles V 1 5,000 ducats to take it under his protection.</p>
<p>In the lucid intervals of peace Sienese art had its final fling.
Antonio</p>
<p>Barile continued the medieval tradition of the wondrous carving of
wood. Lorenzo di Mariano built in the church of Fontegiusta a high altar
of classic beauty. Iacopo della Quercia took his cognomen from a village
in Siena’s hinterland. His early sculptures were financed by Orlando</p>
<p>Malevolti, who thus belied his name of Evil Faces. When Orlando was
banished for taking the losing side in politics, Iacopo left Siena for
Lucca (1390), where he designed a stately tomb for Ilaria del Carretto.
After competing unsuccessfully against Donatello and Brunellesco in
Florence, he went on to Bologna, and carved over and alongside the
portal of San Petronio marble statues and reliefs which are among the
finest sculptures of the Renaissance (1425-8). Michelangelo saw them
there seventy years later, admired the vigor of the nude and virile
figures, and found in them for a time inspiration and stimulus.
Returning to Siena, Iacopo spent much of the next ten years on his
masterpiece, the Fonte Gaia. On the base of this Gay Fountain he cut in
marble a relief of the Virgin as the official sovereign of the city;
around her he represented the Seven Cardinal Virtues; for good measure
he added scenes from the Old Testament, and filled the surviving spaces
with children and animals — all with a power of conception and execution
that presaged Michelangelo. For this work Siena renamed him Iacopo della
Fonte, and paid him 2200 crowns (5,000?). He died at sixty-four,
exhausted by his art and mourned by the citizens.</p>
<p>Through most of’ the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the proud
city engaged a hundred artists, of any provenance, to make its cathedral
the architectural jewel of Italy. From 1413 to 1423 Domenico del Coro, a
master of intarsia, was superintendent of the cathedral work; he and
Matteo di Giovanni and Domenico Beccafumi and Pinturicchio and many
others inlaid the floor of the great shrine with marble marquetry
picturing episodes from Scripture, and making this the most remarkable
church pave- ment in the world. Antonio Federighi carved for the
cathedral two hand- some baptismal fonts, and Lorenzo Vecchietta cast
for it a dazzling taber- nacle in bronze. Sano di Matteo raised the
Loggia della Mercanzia in the Campo (1417-38), and Vecchietta and
Federighi faced its pillars with harmonious statuary. The fourteenth
century saw a dozen famous palaces take form — the Salimbeni, the
Buonsignori, the Saracini, the Grottanelli . . . and about 1470 Bernardo
Rossellino supplied plans for the Florentine-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>(chap. VIII</p>
<p>style palace of the Piccolomini family. Andrea Bregno designed for
the Piccolomini an altar in the cathedral (1481); and Cardinal Francesco
Piccolomini built, as an adjunct to the duomo , a library (1495) to
house the books and manuscripts bequeathed to him by his uncle Pius II.
Lorenzo di Mariano gave the library one of the handsomest portals in
Italy; and Pinturicchio and his aides (1503-8) painted on the walls,
within superb architectural frames, delightful frescoes picturing scenes
in the life of the scholar Pope.</p>
<p>Siena in the fifteenth century was rich in painters of secondary
ex-</p>
<p>cellence. Taddeo Bartoli, Domenico di Bartolo, Lorenzo di Pietro
called Vecchietta, Stefano di Giovanni called Sassetta, Sani di Pietro,
Matteo di Giovanni, Francesco di Giorgio — all continued the strong
religious tradi- tion of Sienese art, painting devout themes and somber
saints, often in stiff and cramping polyptychs, as if resolved to
prolong the Middle Ages for- ever. Sassetta, recently restored to fame
by a passing whim of critical opinion, painted in simple line and color
a charming procession of Magi and attendants moving sedately through
mountain passes to the crib of Christ; he described in a graceful
triptych the birth of the Virgin; celebrated the wedding of St. Francis
to pove rty; and died in 1450, “stabbed through and through by the sharp
southwest wind.” 5 ’</p>
<p>Only toward the end of the century did Siena produce an artist whose
name, for good or evil, rang through Italy. His real name was Giovanni
Antonio Bazzi, but his ribald contemporaries rechristened him Sodoma be-
cause he was so candid a catamite. He accepted the cognomen with good
humor as a title that many deserved but failed to obtain. Bom at
Vercelli (1477), he moved to Milan, and may have learned painting and
pederasty from Leonardo. He put a Vincian smile on his Brera Madonna,
and copied Leonardo’s Leda so well that for centuries his imitation was
taken for the Master’s original. Migrating to Siena after Lodovico’s
fall, he developed a style of his own, picturing Christian subjects with
a pagan joy in the human form. Perhaps it was during this first stay at
Siena that Bazzi</p>
<p>painted a powerful Christ at the Column — about to be scourged, yet
physically perfect. For the monks of Monte Oliveto Maggiore he told the
story of St. Benedict in a series of frescoes, some carelessly done,
some so seductively beautiful that the abbot insisted, before paying
Sodoma, that the nude figures should be prefaced with clothing to
preserve peace of mind in the monastery. 8</p>
<p>When the banker Agostino Chigi visited his native Siena in 1 507 he
took a fancy to Sodoma’s work, and invited him to Rome. Pope Julius II
set</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 239</p>
<p>the artist to work painting one of the rooms of Nicholas V in the
Vatican, but Sodoma spent so much time living up to his name that the
old Pope soon turned him out. Raphael replaced him, and Sodoma, in a
modest mo- ment, studied the young master’s style, and absorbed
something of his smooth finish and delicate grace. Chigi rescued Sodoma
by engaging him to paint in the Villa Chigi the story of Alexander and
Roxana, and soon Leo X, succeeding Julius, restored Sodoma to papal
favor. Giovanni</p>
<p>painted for the jolly Pope a nude Lucretia stabbing herself to death;
Leo rewarded him well, and made him a Cavalier of the Order of
Christ.</p>
<p>Returning to Siena with these laurels, Sodoma received numerous com-
missions from clergy and laity. Though apparently a skeptic, he painted
Madonnas almost as lovely as Raphael’s. The m artyrdom of St. Sebastian
was a subject especially to his taste; and his rendering of the theme in
the Pitti Palace has never been excelled. In the church of San Domenico
at Siena he pictured St. Catherine fainting, so realistically that
Baldassare Peruzzi pronounced the painting incomparable in its kind.
While engaged on these religious subjects, Sodoma scandalized Siena with
what Vasari calls his “bestial pursuits.”</p>
<p>His manner of life was licentious and dishonorable; and as he</p>
<p>always had boys and beardless youths about him, of whom he was</p>
<p>inordinately fond, this earned him the name of Sodoma. Instead of</p>
<p>feeling shame, he gloried in it, writing verses about it, and
singing</p>
<p>them to the accompaniment of the lute. He loved to fill his house</p>
<p>with all kinds of curious animals: badgers, squirrels, apes,
cata-</p>
<p>mounts, dwarf asses, Barbary race horses, Elba ponies, jackdaws,</p>
<p>bantams, turtle doves, and similar creatures. … In addition to
these</p>
<p>he had a raven which he had taught to speak so well that it imitated
his voice, especially in answering the door, and many mistook it for</p>
<p>its master. The other animals were so tame that they were always</p>
<p>about him, with their strange gambols, so that his house resembled a
veritable Noah’s ark . 7</p>
<p>He married a woman of good family; but after giving him one child she
left him. Having worn out his welcome and his income in Siena, he went
to Volterra, Pisa, and Lucca (154 1-2), seeking new patrons. When these
too ran out, Sodoma went back to Siena, shared his poverty for seven
years with his animals, and died at seventy-two. He had accomplished in
art all that a skilled hand could do without a deepened soul to guide
it.</p>
<p>The man who superseded him at Siena was Domenico Beccafumi. When</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Perugino came there in 1508 Domenico studied his style. When Perugino
left, Domenico sought further instruction in Rome, familiarized himself
with the remains of classic art, and sought the secrets of Raphael and
Michelangelo. In Siena again, he first imitated Sodoma, then rivaled
him. The Signory asked him to decorate the Sala del Consistorio; he
painted its walls during six laborious years (1529-35) with scenes from
Roman his- tory; the result was technically excellent, spiritually
dead.</p>
<p>When Beccafumi died (1551) the Sienese Renaissance was finished.
Baldassare Peruzzi was of Siena, but left it for Rome. Siena fell back
into the arms of the Virgin, and adjusted itself without discomfort to
the Counter Reformation. To this day it is contentedly orthodox, and
lures tired or curious spirits with its simple piety, its picturesque
annual palio or tournament of races (from 1659), and its precious
immunity to mo- dernity.</p>

<li>UMBRIA AND THE BAGLIONI</li>
</ol>
<p>Hemmed in by Tuscany on the west, Latium on the south, and the</p>
<p>Marches on the north and east, mountainous Umbria lifts up, here and
there, the cities of Terni, Spoleto, Assisi, Foligno, Perugia, Gubbio.
We preface them here with Fabriano — across the border in the Adarches —
be- cause Gentile da Fabriano was a prelude to the Umbrian school.</p>
<p>Gentile is an obscure but dominating figure: painting medieval
pictures in Gubbio and Perugia and the Marches, feeling vaguely the
influence of the early Sienese painters, and slowly maturing to such
prominence that Pandolfo Malatesta, says a quite incredible tradition,
paid him 14,000 ducats to fresco the chapel of the Broletto in Brescia (
c . 1410). 8 Some ten years later the Venetian Senate commissioned him
to paint a battle scene in the Hall of the Great Council; Gentile
Bellini seems to have been among his pupils at that time. We find him
next in Florence, painting for the church of Santa Trinita an Adoration
of the Magi (1423) which even the proud Florentines acclaimed as a
masterpiece. It is still preserved in the Uffizi: a bright and
picturesque cavalcade of kings and retinues, stately horses, musing
cattle, squatting monkeys, alert dogs, a lovely Mary, all compel- lingly
focused upon a charming Infant who places an explorative hand upon the
bald head of kneeling royalty; it is a picture admirable in gay color
and flowing line, but almost primitively innocent of perspective and
fore- shortening. Pope Martin V called Gentile to Rome, where the artist
de- posited some frescoes in San Giovanni Laterano; they have
disappeared,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 241</p>
<p>but we may surmise their quality from the enthusiasm of Rogier van
der Weyden, who, on seeing them, pronounced Gentile the greatest painter
in Italy. 9 In the church of Santa Maria Nuova Gentile painted other
lost frescoes, one of which led Michelangelo to say to Vasari, “he had a
hand like his name.” 10 Gentile died in Rome in 1427, at the height of
his re - nown.</p>
<p>His career is evidence that Umbria, to which he culturally belonged,
was generating its own geniuses and style in art. By and large, however,
the Umbrian painters took their lead from Siena, and continued the re-
ligious mood without a break from Duccio to Perugino and the early
Raphael. Assisi was the spiritual source of Umbrian art. The churches
and legends of St. Francis disseminated through the neighboring
provinces a devotion that dominated painting as well as architecture,
and discounte- nanced the pagan or secular themes that were elsewhere
invading Italian art. Portraits were seldom asked of Umbrian painters,
but private indi- viduals, sometimes using the savings of a lifetime,
commissioned an artist, usually local, to paint a Madonna or a Holy
Family for their favorite</p>
<p>chapel; and there was hardly a church so poor but it could raise
funds for such a symbol of hopeful piety and community pride. So Gubbio
had her own painter, Ottaviano Nelli, and Foligno had Niccolo di
Liberatore, and Perugia boasted Bonfigli, Perugino, and
Pinturicchio.</p>
<p>Perugia was the oldest, largest, richest, and most violent of the
Umbrian towns. Placed sixteen hundred feet high on an almost
inaccessible summit, it commanded a spacious view of the surrounding
country; the site was so favorable for defense that the Etruscans built
— or inherited — a city there before the foundation of Rome. Long
claimed by the popes as one of the Papal States, Perugia declared itself
independent in 1375, and enjoyed over a century of passionate
factionalism surpassed only by Siena. Two wealthy families fought for
control of the city — its commerce, its government, its benefices, its
40,000 souls. The Oddi and the Baglioni murdered one an- other by
stealth or openly in the streets; their conflicts fertilized with blood
the p.lain that smiled beneath their towers. The Baglioni were noted for
their handsome faces and physiques, their courage and their ferocity. In
the heart of pious Umbria they scorned the Church, and gave them- selves
pagan names — Ercole, Troilo, Ascanio, Annibale, Atalanta, Penelope,
Lavinia, Zenobia. In 1445 the Baglioni repelled an attempt of the Oddi
to seize Perugia; thereafter they ruled the city as despots, though
formally acknowledging it to be a papal fief. Let Perugia’s own
historian, Fran cesco Matarazzo, describe the Baglioni government:</p>
<p>2 4 2</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>From the day the Oddi were expelled, our city went from bad to</p>
<p>worse. All the young men followed the trade of arms. Their lives</p>
<p>were disorderly, and every day divers excesses were divulged, and</p>
<p>the city had lost all reason and justice. Every man administered
right unto himself, by his own authority and with royal hand. The
pope</p>
<p>sent many legates, if so be the city could be brought to order.
But</p>
<p>all who came went back in dread of being hewn to pieces; for the</p>
<p>Baglioni threatened to throw some from the windows of the palace, so
that no cardinal or other legate durst approach Perugia unless he were
their friend. And the city was brought to such misery that the</p>
<p>most lawless men were most prized; and those who had slain two or
three men walked as they pleased through the palace, and went with sword
or poignard to speak to the podesta and other magistrates.</p>
<p>Every man of worth was trodden down by bravos whom the nobles</p>
<p>favored, nor could a citizen call his property his own. The
nobles</p>
<p>robbed first one and then another of goods and land. All offices were
sold or else suppressed; and taxes and extortions were so grievous</p>
<p>that everyone cried out. 11</p>
<p>What can be done, a cardinal asked of Pope Alexander VI, with “these
demons who have no fear of holy water”? 12</p>
<p>Having disposed of the Oddi, the Baglioni divided into new factions,
and fought one of the bloodiest feuds of the Renaissance. Atalanta</p>
<p>Baglioni, being left a widow through the assassination of her
husband, consoled herself with the beauty of her son Grifonetto, whom
Matarazzo describes as another Ganymede. Her happiness seemed fully
restored when he married Zenobia Sforza, whose beauty matched his own.
But a minor branch of the Baglioni plotted to overthrow the ruling
branch — Astorre, Guido, Simonetto, and Gianpaolo. Valuing Grifonetto’s
bravery, the con - spirators won him to their plan by deluding him into
the belief that</p>
<p>Gianpaolo had seduced his young wife. One night in the year 1500,
when the dominant Baglioni families had left their castles and assembled
in Perugia for the wedding of Astorre and Lavinia, the conspirators
attacked them in their beds, and killed all but one of them. Gianpaolo
escaped by clambering over roofs, hiding through the night with some
frightened uni- versity students, disguising himself in a scholastic
gown, and so passing out through the city gates at dawn. Atalanta,
horrified to learn that her son had shared in these murders, drove him
from her presence with curses. The assassins dispersed, leaving
Grifonetto homeless and alone in the city. On the morrow Gianpaolo, with
an armed escort, re-entered Perugia, and came upon Grifonetto in a
public square. He wished to spare the youth,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 243</p>
<p>but the soldiers wounded Grifonetto mortally before Gianpaolo could
restrain them. Atalanta and Zenobia came from their concealment to find
son and husband dying in the street. Atalanta knelt by him, took back
her curses, gave him her blessing, and asked him to forgive those who
had slain him. Then, says Matarazzo, “the noble youth extended his right
hand to his young mother, pressing her white hand, and forthwith he
breathed his sou l from his beautiful body.” 13 Perugino and Raphael
were painting in Perugia at this time.</p>
<p>Gianpaolo had a hundred men massacred, in the streets or in the
cathe- dral, on suspicion of complicity in the plot; he had the Palazzo
Comunale decorated with the heads of the slain, and with their portraits
hung head downward; here was a substantial commission for Perugian art.
Thereafter he ruled the city unchallenged until he yielded to Julius II
(1506), and consented to govern as vicar of the popes. But he did not
know how to govern except by assassination. In 1520 Leo X, tired of his
crimes, lured him to Rome with a safe-conduct, and had him beheaded in
the Castel Sant’ Angelo; this was one form of Renaissance diplomacy.
Other</p>
<p>Baglioni maintained themselves in power for a time; but after
Malatesta Baglioni had murdered a papal legate Pope Paul III Sent forces
to take final possession of the city as an appanage of the Church
(1534).</p>
<p>V. PERUGINO</p>
<p>Under this cloak-and-dagger government literature and art prospered
surprisingly; the same passionate temperament that worshiped the Virgin,
flouted cardinals, and murdered close kin could feel the fever of
creative writing, or steel itself to the discipline of art. Matarazzo’s
Cronaca della CittA di Perugia, describing the zenith of the Baglioni,
is one of the most vivid literary products of the Renaissance. Commerce,
before the Baglioni came to power, had accumulated enough wealth to
build the massive Gothic Palazzo Comunale (1280-1333), and to adorn it
and the adjoining Collegio del Cambio (1452-6) — Chamber of Commerce —
with some of the finest art in Italy. The Collegio had a judicial throne
and a moneychangers’ bench so exquisitely carved that no one could
reproach the businessmen of Perugia with lack of taste. The church of
San Domenico had choir stalls (1476) almost as elegant, and a celebrated
chapel of the Rosary designed by Agostino di Duccio. Agostino hesitated
between sculpture and archi- tecture; usually he combined them, as in
the oratorio or prayer chapel of San Bernardino (1461), where he covered
almost the entire fa£ade with</p>
<p>244 THE RENAISSANCE (chap. VIII</p>
<p>statues, reliefs, arabesques, and other ornament. An unadorned
surface al- ways aroused an Italian artist.</p>
<p>At least fifteen painters were busy meeting such challenges in
Perugia. Their leader in Perugino’s youth was Benedetto Bonfigli.
Apparently</p>
<p>through association with Domenico Veneziano or Piero della Francesca,
or through studying the frescoes painted by Benozzo Gozzoli at
Montefalco, Benedetto learned something of the new techniques that
Masolino, Masac- cio, Uccello, and others had developed in Florence.
When he painted frescoes for the Palazzo Comunale he displayed a
knowledge of perspective new among Umbrian artists, though his figures
borrowed stereotyped faces and were shrouded in shapeless drapery. A
younger rival, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, equaled Benedetto in dullness of
color, surpassed him in delicacy of sentiment and occasional grace. Both
Bonfigli and Fiorenzo, in Perugian tradition, taught the two masters who
brought Umbrian painting to its culmination.</p>
<p>Bernardino Betti, called Pinturicchio, learned the arts of tempera
and fresco from Fiorenzo, but never adopted the oil technique that came
to Perugino from the Florentines. In 1481, aged twenty-seven, he accom-
panied Perugino to Rome, and covered a panel in the Sistine Chapel with
a lifeless Baptism of Christ. But he improved; and when Innocent VIII
bade him decorate a loggia of the Belvedere Palace he struck out on a
new line by painting views of Genoa, Milan, Florence, Venice, Naples,
and Rome. His drawing was imperfect, but there was a pleasant plein-air
quality in his painting that attracted Alexander VI. That genial Borgia,
wishing to adorn his own chambers in the Vatican, commissioned
Pinturicchio and some aides to paint the walls and ceilings with
frescoes of prophets, sibyls, musi - cians, scientists, saints,
Madonnas, and perhaps a mistress. These again so pleased the Pope that
when an apartment was designed for his use in the Castel Sant’ Angelo he
engaged the artist to portray there some episodes in the Pope’s conflict
with Charles VIII (1495). By this time Perugia had</p>
<p>heard of Pinturicchio’s fame; it called him home; and the c hurch of
Santa Maria de’ Fossi asked him for an altarpiece. He responded with a
Virgin, Child, and St. John that satisfied all but the professionals. In
Siena, as we have seen, he made the Piccolomini Library radiant with a
vivid portrayal of the life and legend of Pius II; and despite many
technical faults, this pictorial narrative makes that room one of the
most delightful remains of Renaissance art. After spending five years on
this work Pinturicchio went to Rome, and shared in the humiliation of
Raphael’s success. Thereafter he faded from the artistic scene, perhaps
through illness, perhaps because</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl) TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 245</p>
<p>Perugino and Raphael so obviously excelled him. A doubtful story
reports that he died of hunger in Siena, aged fifty-nine (1513). 14</p>
<p>Pietro Perugino received that surname because he made Perugia his
home; Perugia itself always called him by his family name, Vannucci. Bom
in nearby Citta della Pieve (1446), he was sent to Perugia at the age of
nine and was there apprenticed to an artist of uncertain identity.
Accord- ing to Vasari his teacher ranked the painters of Florence as the
best in Italy, and advised the youth to go and study there. Pietro went,
carefully copied the frescoes of Masaccio, and enrolled as an apprentice
or assistant to Verrocchio. Leonardo entered Verrocchio’s studio about
1468; very probably Perugino met him, and, though six years older, did
not disdain to learn from him some qualities of finish and grace, and a
better handling of perspective, coloring, and oils. These skills already
appear in Perugino’s St. Sebastian (Louvre), together with a pretty
architectural setting, and a landscape as placid as the face of the
perforated saint. After leaving Ver- rocchio, Perugino returned to the
Umbrian style of demure and tender Madonnas; and through him the harder
and more realistic traditions of Florentine painting may have been
softened into the warmer idealism of Fra Bartolommeo and Andrea del
Sarto.</p>
<p>By 1481 Perugino, now thirty-five, had won sufficient repute to be
in- vited by Sixtus IV to Rome. In the Sistine Chapel he painted
several</p>
<p>frescoes, of which the finest survivor is Christ Giving the Keys to
Peter. It is too formal and conventional in its symmetrical composition;
but here, for the first time in painting, the air, with its subtle
gradations of light, be- comes a distinct and almost palpable element in
the picture; the drapery, so stereotyped in Bonfigli, is here tucked and
wrinkled into life; and a few of the faces are finished to striking
individuality — Jesus, Peter, Signorelli, and, not least, the large,
rotund, sensual, matter-of-fact countenance of Perugino himself,
transformed for the occasion into a disciple of Christ.</p>
<p>In i486 Perugino was again in Florence, for the archives of the
city</p>
<p>record his arrest for criminal assault. He and a friend disguised
themselves, and, armed with clubs, waited in the dark of a December
night to waylay some chosen enemy. They were detected before they could
commit any injury. The friend was banished, Perugino was fined ten
florins. 15 After another interlude in Rome he set up a bottega in
Florence (1492), hired assistants, and began to turn out pictures, not
always carefully finished, for customers near and far. For the Gesuati
brotherhood he made a Pieti whose melancholy Virgin and pensive Magdalen
were to be repeated by him and his aides in a hundred variations for any
prosperous institution or</p>
<p>246 THE RENAISSANCE ( CHAP, VIII</p>
<p>individual. A Madonna and Saints found its way to Vienna, another to
Cremona, another to Fano, another — the Madonna in Glory — to Perugia,
another to the Vatican; another is in the Uffizi. Rivals charged him
with turning his studio into a factory; they thought it scandalous that
he should grow so rich and fat. He smiled and raised his prices. When
Venice in- vited him to paint two panels in the Ducal Palace, offering
400 ducats (000?), he demanded 800; and when these were not forthcoming
he re- mained in Florence. He clung to cash, and let the credit go. He
made no pretense of despising wealth; he was resolved not to starve when
his brush began to tremble; he bought property in Florence and Perugia,
and was bound to land on at least one foot after any overturn. His
self-portrait in the Cambio at Perugia (1500) is a remarkably honest
confession. A pudgy face, large nose, hair flowing carelessly from under
a close red cap, eyes quiet but penetrating, lips slightly contemptuous,
heavy neck and powerful frame: here was a man hard to deceive, ready for
battle, sure of himself, and holding no high opinion of the human race.
“He was not a religious man,” says Vasari, “and would never believe in
the immortality of the soul.” 19</p>
<p>His skepticism and commercialism did not prevent him from occasional
generosity, 17 or from producing some of the tenderest devotional
pictures of the Renaissance. He painted a lovable Madonna for the
Certosa di Pavia (now in London) ; and the Magdalen attributed to him in
the Louvre is so fair a sinner that one would not need divine mercy to
forgive her. For the nuns of Santa Clara at Florence he painted an
Entombment in which the women had a rare beauty of features, and the
faces of the old men summarized their lives, and the lines of
composition met on the bloodless corpse of Christ, and a landscape of
slender trees on rocky slopes, and distant town on a quiet bay, shed an
atmosphere of calm over the scene of death and grief. The man could
paint as well as sell.</p>
<p>His success in Florence finally convinced the Perugians of his worth.
When the merchants of the Cambio decided to adorn their Collegio they
emptied their pockets with tardy largesse and offered the assignment to
Pietro Vannucci. Following the mood of the age and the suggestions of a
local scholar, they asked that their hall of audience should be
decorated with a medley of Christian and pagan subjects: on the ceiling
the seven planets and the signs of the zodiac; on one wall a Nativity
and a Transfigu- ration; on another the Eternal Father, the prophets,
and six pagan sibyls, prefiguring Michelangelo’s; and on another wall
the four classical virtues, each illustrated by pagan heroes: Prudence
by Numa, Socrates, and Fabius;</p>
<p>TUSCANY AND UMBRIA</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>2 47</p>
<p>Justice by Pittacus, Furius, and Trajan, Fortitude by Lucius,
Leonidas, and Horatius Codes; Temperance by Pericles, Cincinnatus, and
Scipio. All this, it seems, was accomplished by Perugino and his aides —
including Raphael — in the one year 1500, the very year when the feuds
of the Baglioni incarnadined the streets of Perugia. When the blood had
been washed away the citizens could stream in to see the new beauty of
the Cambio. Perhaps they found the pagan worthies a bit wooden, and
wished that Perugino had shown them not posing but engaged in some
action that would have given them life. But the David was majestic, the
Erythrean Sibyl almost as gracious as a Raphael Madonna, and the Eternal
Father a remarkably good conception for an atheist. On those walls, in
his sixtieth year, Perugino reached the fullness of his powers. In 1501
the grateful city made bim a municipal prior.</p>
<p>From that zenith he rapidly declined. In 1502 he painted a Marriage
of the Virgin, which Raphael imitated two years later in the Sposalizio.
About 1 503 he returned to Florence. He was not pleased to find the city
in much ado about Michelangelo’s David; he was among the artists sum -
moned to consider where the figure should be placed, and his opinion was
overruled by the sculptor himself. The two men, meeting shortly after-
ward, traded insults; Michelangelo, then a lad of twenty-nine, called
Perugino a blockhead, and informed him that his art was “antiquated and
absurd.” 18 Perugino sued him for libel, and won nothing but ridic ule.
In 1505 he agreed to finish for the Annunziata a Deposition that the
late Filippino Lippi had begun, and to add to it an Assumption of the
Virgin. He completed Filippino’s work with skill and dispatch; but in
the As - sumption he repeated so many figures that he had used in
previous pictures that the artists of Florence (still jealous of his
quondam fees) condemned him for dishonesty and sloth. He left the city
in anger, and took up his residence in Perugia.</p>
<p>The inevitable defeat of age by youth was repeated when he accepted
an invitation from Julius II to decorate a room in the Vatican (1507).
When he had made some progress his former pupil, Raphael, appeared, and
swept everything before him. Perugino left Rome wtih heavy heart. Back
in Perugia, he prospected for commissions, and kept on working to the
end. He began (1514) and apparently finished (1520) a complex altarpiece
for the church of Sant’ Agostino, recounting again the story of Christ.
For the church of the Madonna delle Lagrime at Trevi he painted (1521)
an Adoration of the Magi which, despite some palsied drawing, is an
astonish- ing product for a man of seventy-five. In 1523, while he was
painting at</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>neighboring Fontignano, he fell a victim to the plague, or perhaps
died of old age and weariness. According to tradition he refused the
last sacra- ments, saying that he preferred to see what would happen, in
the other world, to an obstinately impenitent soul. 19 He was buried in
unhallowed ground. 90</p>
<p>Everyone knows the defects of Perugino’s painting— the
exaggerated</p>
<p>Umbrian devotion rather than the realities and significance of life.
And yet there is much in them that can please the soul mature enough to
sur- mount its sophistication: the living quality of their light, the
modest loveli- ness of their women, the bearded majesty of their old
men, the soft and quiet colors, the gracious landscapes covering all
tragedies with peace.</p>
<p>When Perugino returned to Perugia in 1499, after long stays in
Florence, he brought into Umbrian painting the technical skill, without
the critical faculty, of the Florentines. When he died he had faithfully
passed down those skills to his associates and pupils — to Pinturicchio,
Francesco Ubertino “11 Bachiacca,” Giovanni di Pietro “Lo Spagna,” and
Raphael. The master had served his purpose: he had enriched and
transmitted his heritage, and had trained a pupil to surpass him.
Raphael is Perugino faultless, perfected, and complete.</p>
