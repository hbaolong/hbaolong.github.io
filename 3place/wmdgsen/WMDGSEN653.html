<h4 id="chapter-xiii">CHAPTER XIII</h4>
<p>Peter the Great</p>
<p>1698-1725</p>
<p>I. THE BARBARIAN</p>
<p>V OLTAIRE wanted “to know what were the steps by which men</p>
<p>passed from barbarism to civilization.” 1 No wonder he was
interested</p>
<p>He was the only truly educated prince. He was not only the legislator
of his country, but he understood perfectly all naval science. He was an
architect, an anatomist, a surgeon, … an expert soldier, a consum- mate
economist. … To make him the model of all princes he only</p>
<p>needed an education less barbarous and ferocious. 2</p>
<p>We have noted that barbarous and ferocious education, the violence
and bloodshed that surrounded Peter’s childhood, shocking his nervous
system and accustoming him to brutality. Even in youth he suffered from
a nervous tic, which may have been aggravated later by heavy drinking
and venereal disease. 3 “He is subject to convulsions all over his
body,” reported Burnet after visiting him in England in 1698. 4 “It is
well known,” said an</p>
<p>eighteenth- century Russian, “that this monarch . . . was subject to
short but frequent brain attacks, of a somewhat violent kind. A sort of
convulsion seized him, which for a certain time, and sometimes even for
hours, threw him into such a distressing condition that he could not
bear the sight of anyone, not even his nearest friends. This paroxysm
was always preceded by a strong contortion of the neck towards the left
side, and by a violent contraction of the muscles of th e face.” 5 Yet
he was robust and powerful. We are told that when he and Augustus II met
they rivaled each other in crumpling silver plate in their hands.
Kneller in 1698 pictured him as a youth in arms and regalia, quite
incredibly gentle and innocent; later we find him more realistically
portrayed as a stooping giant, six feet eight and a half inches tall,
with full round face, large eyes and nose, and brown hair falling in
curls rarely cut. His look of stem command hardly harmonized with his
careless and untidy dress, his coarse, darned socks, his rudely cobbled
shoes. While he put a nation in order he left his immediate sur-</p>
<p>39i</p>
<p>392 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>roundings in disorder wherever he went. He was so immersed in large
endeavors that he grudged all time given to little things.</p>
<p>His manners, like his dress, were so informal that he might have been
taken for a peasant rather than a king — except that he had none of the
muzhik’s stolid patience. Sometimes his manners were wors e than a peas-
ant’s, because unrestrained by fear of a master or the law. Seeing a
phallus in a collection of antiquities at Berlin, he ordered his wife to
kiss it; when Catherine refused he threatened to have her beheaded; she
still refused, and he was calmed only by receiving the object as a
present to adorn his private room. 6 In his conversation and
correspondence he allowed himself the crudest obscenities. Time and
again he reproved his closest friends with blows of his massive fist; he
gave Menshikov a bloody nose, and kicked Lefort. His fondness for
practical jokes occasionally took cruel forms; so he forced one of his
aides to eat tortoises, another to drink a whole flask of vinegar, and
young girls to down a soldier’s ration of brandy . He took undue
pleasure in practicing dentistry, and those near him had to guard
against the slightest complaint of a toothache; his forceps were always
at hand. When his valet complained that his wife, on the score of
pretended toothache, refused him the consolations of matrimony, he sent
for her, forcibly extracted a sound tooth, and told her that more would
be forthcoming if she continued celibate. 7</p>
<p>His lawless cruelty exceeded the degree in which it might be excused
as normal or necessary in his time and land. The Russians were
accustomed to cruelty, and were probably less sensitive to pain than
persons of a subtler nervous organization; they may have needed a harsh
discipline; but Peter’s almost personal massacre of the Streltsi
suggests a sadistic pleasure in cruelty, an orgasm of blood; and no need
of the state required to have two conspirators sliced to death inch by
inch. 8 Peter was immune to pity or sentiment, and lacked the sense of
justice that checked the whims of Louis XIV or Frederick the Great. His
violations of his solemn word,</p>
<p>however, were fully in the manner of the age.</p>
<p>Like the muzhik, Peter thought intoxication was a reasonable vacation
from reality. He had taken upon himself all the burdens of the state,
and the far greater task of transforming an Oriental people into Western
civilization; festive drinking with his friends seemed a merited relief
from these undertakings. He heartily accepted the peasant adage that
drinking is the Russian’s joy. The ability to hold liquor was one of his
measures of a man. When he was in Paris he wagered that his
priest-confessor could drink more and remain stable than the
priest-secretary of the French ministry; the contest went on for an
hour; when the abbe rolled under the table Peter hugged his priest for
having “saved the honor of Russia.” 9 About 1690 Peter and his intimates
formed a band called the “Most</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>393</p>
<p>Drunken Assembly 〔sobor〕 of Fools and Jesters.” Prince Feodor
Romoda - novsky was elected czar of the sobor; Peter accepted a
subordinate po- sition (as he did in the army and navy), and often in
real life he pretended that Romodanovsky was Czar of Russia. The sobor
of drunkards was formally dedicated to the worship of Bacchus and Venus;
it had an elabo- rate ritual, mimicking with grossness and obscenity
those of the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches; and much of
this mock ritual was composed by Peter himself. The sobor took part in
many official state celebrations. When its mock patriarch, Nikita Zatov,
aged eighty-four, married a bride of sixty, Peter designed and commanded
an ornate ribald ceremonial (1715), in which the dignitaries and ladies
of the court were to take part along with bears and stags and goats, and
ambassadors playing flutes or the hurdy-gurdy, and Peter beating a drum.
10</p>
<p>His sense of humor was hilarious and unrestrained, often stooping to
buffoonery. His court was crowded with jesters and dwarfs, who seemed
indispensable to every ceremony. Once the Czar, nearly seven feet tall,
playing Gulliver to his Lilliputians, rode in a procession at the head
of twenty-four mounted dwarfs. At one time Peter had seventy-two dwarfs
at his court, some of whom were served up at table in gigantic pies.
There were giants too, but most of these were sent as gifts to Frederick
William of Prussia to join his army of obelisks. Several Negroes were
presented to Peter. He held them in high esteem, and sent some of them
to Paris for an education. One of them became a Russian general, the
great-grandfather of the poet Pushkin.</p>
<p>So far we picture Peter as still very much a barbarian, an Ivan
the</p>
<p>Terrible but humorous; anxious to be civilized, but envying the West
not for its graces and arts but for its armies and navies, its commerce
and industry and wealth. His virtues were directed to these ends as the
pre- requisites of civilization. Hence his insatiable curiosity. Of
everything he wanted to know how it worked, and then how it could be
made to work better. On his travels he exhausted his aides by running
about to see this and that, even through the night. He was swamped with
ideas, thereby amazing Leibniz, who had a swamp of his own; but Peter’s
ideas were frankly utilitarian. He had an open mind for anything that
could make his country catch up to the West. In a nation gloomily
religious and</p>
<p>fanatically hostile to foreign creeds and ways, he was as
unprejudiced as a child or a sage, sampling Catholicism, Protestantism,
even free thought. He was rather imitative than original; he
transplanted ideas rather than conceived them; but in attempting to
raise his nation to a competitive level with the West it was wiser to
absorb first the best that the West could teach, and then try to surpass
it. Never had imitation been so original.</p>
<p>His indefatigable devotion to his purpose raised him out of
barbarism</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>to greatness. If he conscripted and consumed millions of Russians to
his ends, he used himself up, too, in the effort to give Russia a modern
army, a more efficient government, more varied and productive
industries, wider commerce, and ports that could reach the world. He was
economical of everything except human life, which was Russia’s one
abundant com - modity. Almost his first measures on reaching power were
to dismiss the horde of servants and palace officials that had cluttered
the royal house- hold; to sell three thousand horses from the royal
stables; to sweep away three hundred cooks and kitchen boys; to reduce
the royal table, even on feast days, to sixteen places at most; to
dispense with formal receptions and balls; and to make over to the state
the sums that had heretofore been allotted to these luxuries. His
father, Alexis, had left him a personal prop- erty of 10,734 dessiatines
(28,982 acres) of cultivated land and fifty thou- sand houses, bringing
in a revenue of 200,000 rubles yearly; Peter turned nearly all this over
to the state treasury, reserving as his own only the ancient patrimony
of the Romanov family — eight hundred “souls” in the province of
Novgorod. In effect, and in sharp contrast to Louis XIV, the greatest of
the czars reduced his court to a few friends, with an occasional
festival, informal and sometimes hilarious, to brighten Moscow’s
monotony. Often his economy became parsimony. He underpaid his palace
staff, meted out mathematically its daily allowance of food, invited his
friends not to dinner but to picnics where each would pay his share; and
when the prostitutes who served him bemoaned their modest honorariums he
replied that he paid them as much as he paid a grenadier, whose services
were far more valuable.</p>
<p>Women, with one exception, were minor incidents in his life. He was
not keenly sensitive to beauty. He had sexual needs, but he dispatched
them without ritual. He did not like to sleep alone, but this had
nothing to do with sex; usually he had a servant share his bed, probably
he wanted someone near him in case he should have a convulsion during
the night. At seventeen, to quiet his mother, he married Eudoxia
Lopukhina, who was described as “beautiful but stupid”; finding one
quality more la sting than the other, he neglected her, and went back to
his friends and his ships. He took a succession of transient mistresses,
nearly always of lowly origin and condition. When Frederick II of
Denmark jested with him</p>
<p>about having a mistress, Peter answered, “Brother, my harlots do not
cost me much, but yours cost you thousands of crowns, which you could
spend in a better way.” 11 Both Lefort and Menshikov served the Czar as
procurers, and Menshikov surrendered his o wn mistress to be Peter’s
second wife. There must have been remarkable ability in her to raise
her, like Justinian’s Theodora, from strumpet to empress.</p>
<p>The future Catherine I was born about 1685 in Livonia of humble
stock.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>Left an orphan, she was brought up as a servant by the Lutheran
Pastor Gliick in Marienburg. He taught her the catechism but not the
alphabet; she never learned to read. In 1702 a Russian army under
Sheremetiev be- sieged Marienburg. Despairing of defense, the commander
of the garrison decided to blow up his fortress and himself. Pastor
Gliick, informed of his intention, took his family and his servant and
fled to the Russian camp. He was sent on to Moscow, but Catherine was
kept as a solace for the soldiers. She graduated through them to
Sheremetiev to Menshikov to Peter. In those wars and regions a simple
woman had to be complaisant in order to eat. For a time Catherine seems
to have served both Menshikov and the Czar. They liked her because she
was neat, cheerful, kind, and understanding; for example, she did not
insist on being sole mistress. Peter found her a gay relief after the
alarums of politics or war and the tantrums of jealous concubines. She
accompanied him on campaigns, lived like a soldier, cut her hair, slept
on the ground, and did not flinch when she saw men shot down at her
side. When a convulsion seized Peter, and all others were afraid to
touch him, she would speak to him soothingly, caress him, calm him, and
let him sleep with his head on her breast. When they were apart he wrote
to his “Katierinoushka” letters of playful and yet sincere tenderness.
She became indispensable to him. By 1710 she was his wife in everything
but law. She bore him several children. In 1711 she helped to save him
at the Prut. In 1712 he publicly acknowledged her as his wife. In 1722
he crowned her empress.</p>
<p>Her influence over him was good in many ways. She, the peasant girl,
improved the manners of the royal boor. She moderated his drinking; on
several occasions she entered the room where he was carousing with
friends, and quietly commanded him, “Pora domoi , batioushka” (Come
home, little father), and he obeyed. She winked at his postmarital
flirtations. She made no attempt to influence politics, but she saw to
it that the Czar provided for her future, her relatives, and her
friends. She overcame widespread re- sentment of her elevation by acting
as an angel of mercy; in several in- stances she saved persons from the
penalties to which Peter wished to condemn them; and when he insisted on
severity he had to conceal it from her. She abused her power over him by
selling her intercession; in this way she amassed a secret fortune, part
of which she judiciously invested under assumed names at Hamburg or
Amsterdam. Shall we blame her for seeking some security at a time when
everything depended upon one man’s whim, and all Russia was in flux?</p>
<p>396</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PETRINE REVOLUTION</li>
</ol>
<p>Peter had inherited absolute power, took it for granted, and
never</p>
<p>doubted its necessity. Rule by the duma of boyars would restore
feudal separatism and national chaos or stagnation; rule by a democratic
assembly was impossible in a country still mentally and morally
primitive; Peter agreed with Cromwell and Louis XIV that only the
concentration of</p>
<p>authority and responsibility could organize the human motley into a
state strong enough to control the passions of the people and repel the
attacks of land-hungry enemies. He thought of himself not as a despot
but as a servant of the nation and its future; and in large measure this
was an honest belief, at least half true.</p>
<p>He worked as hard as the simplest peasant in his realm. Normally he
rose at five in the morning and labored fourteen hours a day. He slept
only six hours at night, but took a siesta after noon. Such a program
was not impracticable in the St. Petersburg summers, when daylight began
at 3 a.m. and lasted till io p.m.; but in winter much of it had to go
on</p>
<p>during the night, which began about three in the afternoon and
continued till nine the next morning.</p>
<p>St. Petersburg was the symbol and Archimedean fulcrum of his revolu-
tion. It was not an ideal site for a capital, being too close to the
coast; even so, it was twenty-five miles from the sea, at a point where
the River Neva split into two branches; and Peter hoped to protect it by
the fortress of Kronstadt that he raised (1710) on an island at the
entrance to the bay. The city itself was founded in 1703, on the model
of Amsterdam. Since much of the site was marshy ( neva is Swedish for
mud), St. Petersburg was built upon piles — or, as a sad Russian saying
had it, upon the bones of the thousands of laborers who were conscripted
to lay those foundations and rear the town. In 1708 some 40,000 men were
sent to the task; in 1709 another 40,000; in 1711, 46,000; in 1713,
40,000 more. They were paid half a ruble per month, which they had to
supplement with begging and thieving. Swedish prisoners of war employed
in the construction died by the thousands. As there were no
wheelbarrows, the men transported the materials in their uplifted
caftans. Stone too was conscripted; a ukase of 1714 forbade the erection
of stone houses anywhere in Russia except in St. Petersburg; but there
every nobleman in the land was commanded to raise a dwelling of stone.
The nobles did it under protest, hating the climate and not sharing
Peter’s love of the sea. For himself Peter had some Dutch artisans put
together a cottage like those that he had seen at Zaandam, with log
walls, shingle roof, and small rooms. He disliked palaces, but allowed
three at Peterhof (now Petrodvorets), on the southern outskirts of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>city, for ceremonial occasions; this “Summer Palace” was destroyed in
the Second World War. In a nearby suburb, Tsarskoe Selo (now Pushkin),
he built a summer cottage for his Katierinoushka.</p>
<p>He did not at first intend to make St. Petersburg a capital as well
as a port; it was too close to hostile Sweden; but after his victory
over Charles XII at Poltava he decided to make the change. He longed to
get away from the somber ecclesiastical atmosphere of Moscow and its
narrow nationalism, and he wanted the conservative nobles to feel
progressive winds from the West. So in 1712 he made it his capital. The
Muscovites mourned, and predicted that God would soon destroy the
half-heathen city. “Before the new capital,” wrote Pushkin, “Moscow
bowed her head, as an imperial widow bows before a young tsaritsa.” 12
Peter was so anxious to Westernize Russia that he dragged it, so to
speak, to the Baltic and bade it look through his “window on the West.”*
To this purpose, and to have a base for his fleet and a port for foreign
trade, he sacrificed all other considerations. The port would be
icebound five months in the year, but it would face the West and touch
the sea. As the Dnieper had made Russia Byzantine and the Volga had made
it Asiatic, so now the Neva would invite it to be European. 14</p>
<p>The next step was to build a navy that would guard the lanes of
Russian commerce through the Baltic to the West. Peter achieved this for
a time by building in the course of his reign a thousand galleys; but
they were hastily and badly constructed, their timbers rotted, their
masts broke in the wind; and after his death Russia reconciled herself
to being what geography had made it, a landlocked country shut off from
the Atlantic, and waiting for the conquest of the air to overleap its
barriers into the world. In this sense Moscow was right : Russia’s power
and defense had to be on land, through its armies and its space. So, in
1917, Moscow had its revenge, and became the capital again.</p>
<p>Peter’s most permanent reform was the reorganization of the army.
Before him it had depended upon levies of peasants led by their feudal
lords, loyal chiefly to them, poorly disciplined, and poorly armed.
Peter undermined the boyars by establishing a standing army manned by
con- scription, equipped with the latest weapons of the West, officered
by men who had passed through the ranks, and disciplined in the new
ideal of proudly serving Russia rather than a narrow province or a hated
lord. It was military necessity that dictated Peter’s revolution. He
could not de - velop Russia without opening a way to the Baltic or the
Mediterranean; he could not do this without a modern army; he could not
maintain such an army without transforming the Russian economy and
government; and</p>
<p>This phrase was apparently first used by Count Francesco Algarotti in
1739. 13</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>he could not transform these without remaking the Russian people in
manners, aims, and soul. It was too great a task for one man, or for one
generation.</p>
<p>He began, in his whimsical impulsive way, with the beards and dress
of the men around him. In 1698, soon after returning from the West, he
had his own sparse beard shaved, and commanded all who wished to keep
his favor to do the same, excepting only the Patriarch of the Orthodox
Church. Soon an edict went throughout Russia that all laymen were to
shave their chins; mustaches might remain. The beard had been almost a
religious symbol in Russia; it had been worn by the Prophets and the
Apostles; and the reigning Patriarch, Adrian, only eight years before,
had condemned the shaving of the beard as irreligious and heretical.
Peter ac- cepted the challenge: beardlessness was to be a sign of
modernity, of willingness to enter into Western civilization. Those
laymen who felt a dire need of whiskers might keep them by paying an
annual tax rising from one kopek for a peasant to a hundred rubles for a
rich merchant. “There were many old Russians,” says an old history,
“who, after having their beards shaved off, saved them preciously, in
order to have them placed in their coffins, fearing that they would not
be allowed to enter heaven without them.” 16</p>
<p>Next to go was the Russian costume. Here too Peter felt that internal
resistance to Westernization would be reduced by wearing Western garb.
He himself cut off the long sleeves of the army officers who appeared
before him. “See,” he said to one of them, “these things are in your
way. You are safe nowhere with them. At one moment you upset a glass,
then you forgetfully dip them in the sauce. Get gaiters made of them.”
16 So an order went forth (January, 1700) commanding all courtiers and
officials in Russia to adopt Western dress. All persons entering or
leaving Moscow had to choose between having their ankle-long caftans cut
at the knees or paying a fine. The women were likewise urged to adopt
Western costume; they resisted less than the men, for in dress women are
annual revolutionists.</p>
<p>Not so much by decrees as by the example of his family, Peter ended
the seclusion of Russia’s women. His father, Alexis, and his mother,
Natalia, had led the way; his half-sister Sophia had broadened it; now
Peter in- vited women to social gatherings, encouraged them to remove
their veils, to dance, to make music, and to seek education, even if
only through tutors. He issued edicts forbidding parents to marry their
children against their will, and requiring an interval of six weeks
between betrothal and marriage; in that period the engaged couple should
be allowed to see each other frequently, and to break off the engagement
if they wished. The women were glad to emerge from the terem; they began
a race to adopt new fashions; and some increase in illegitimate births
gave the clergy a weapon against Peter’s revolution.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>399</p>
<p>The resistance of religion was his greatest obstacle. The clergy
realized that his reforms would lessen their prestige and power. They
bemoaned his toleration of Western faiths in Russia, and they suspected
that he him- self had no religious belief. They heard with horror of the
parodies with which he and his intimates mocked the Orthodox ritual. For
his part Peter resented the diversion of manpower into the vast and
innumerable monas- teries, and he coveted the enormous revenues that
these institutions en- joyed. When the Patriarch Adrian died (October,
1700), Peter deliberately refrained from appointing a successor; he
himself, like Henry VIII in</p>
<p>England, became head of the church, and led a Reformation in Russia.
For twenty-one years the office of patriarch remained vacant, depriving
the Orthodox Church of a leader against the Petrine reforms. In 1721
Peter abolished the office altogether, and replaced it with a “Holy
Synod” of ecclesiastics appointed by the Czar and subject to a lay
procurator. In 1701 he transferred the administration of ecclesiastical
properties to a department of the government. The jurisdiction of the
ecclesiastical courts was curtailed. The appointment of bishops was made
subject to govern- mental approval. Further edicts forbade the
ordination of mystics or fa- natics, and limited the number of
miracle-working centers. Men were not to take monastic vows before the
age of thirty; women were not to take final vows as nuns before the age
of fifty. 17 Monks were to be compelled to do useful work. A census of
monastic properties and revenues was taken by the government; a part of
this income was left to the monasteries, the rest was devoted to the
establishment of schools and hospitals. 18</p>
<p>Most of the clergy resigned themselves to this Russian Reformation,
which, again like that of Henry VIII, left doctrine unchanged. Some</p>
<p>Raskolniki (dissenters) denounced Peter as Antichrist, and urged the
people to refuse him obedience or taxes. He - had the leaders of this
re- bellion arrested, and dealt with them after his usual fashion: some
were knouted and banished to Siberia, some were imprisoned for life, one
died of torture, two were slowly burned to death. 19</p>
<p>For the rest, Peter was abreast of the West in religious toleration.
He protected the Raskolniki from persecution as long as they abstained
from politics. In St. Petersburg, to encourage foreign trade, he allowed
Calvinist, Lutheran, and Catholic churches to be built on the Nevski
Prospekt, which came to be called the “Prospect of Tolerance.” 20 He
protected the</p>
<p>Capuchin monks who entered Russia, but banished the Jesuits (1710) as
too sedulous in propaganda for the Roman Church. In general the re-
ligious reforms of Peter were the most lasting of all. They ended the
Middle Ages in Russia.</p>
<p>A vast process of secularization changed the life and spirit of
Russia</p>
<p>from domination by priests and landlords to rule, almost
regimentation, by the state. Peter subordinated the boyars to his will,
made them serve the</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>public, and reorganized social ranks according to the importance of
the social service performed. A new aristocracy arose, composed of
officials in the army, the navy, and the bureaucracy. The government was
headed by a Senate of nine (later twenty) men appointed by the Czar; it
was administered by nine “colleges” directing respectively taxation and
revenue, expenditure, audit and control, commerce, industry, foreign
relations, war, navy, and law. Responsible to the Senate were the
governors of the twelve provinces, or gubemiyas, and the councils that
ruled the cities. The popula- tion of each city was divided into three
classes: rich merchants and the pro- fessions, teachers and craftsmen,
wage earners and laborers; only the first class could be elected to the
municipal council ( magistrat ), only the first two classes could vote,
but all male taxpayers could take part in the town meetings. The mir, or
village community, took form not as a demo- cratic institution, but as a
body collectively responsible for the poll tax introduced in 1719. Local
autonomy was checked by central control, and there was no thought of
democracy. The rapid transformation that Peter planned could be
achieved, if at all, only by dictatorial power.</p>
<p>That transformation had to be economic as well as political, for
no</p>
<p>purely agricultural society could long maintain its independence
against states enriched and armed by industry. A German economist of the
time pointed out what the next two hundred years would prove — that a
nation exporting chiefly raw material and agricultural products would
soon be- come vassal to states producing and exporting chiefly
manufactured goods. 21 For agriculture, therefore, Peter did little.
Instead of reducing serfdom he extended it to industry. By his own
example he taught the peasants how to cut their corn, and he commanded
the replacement of sickles with scythes. The Russians were accustomed to
burn the woodlands to provide fertilizing ashes for the soil; Peter
forbade this, needing lumber for his ships, trees for his masts. He
introduced the cultivation of the to- bacco plant, the mulberry, and the
vine, and began the Russian breeding of horses and sheep.</p>
<p>But his chief aim was rapid industrialization. The first problem was
to provide raw materials. He spurred the spread of mining; he gave
stimu- lating rewards to men like Nikita Demidov and Aleksandr Stroganov
who showed enterprise and skill in mining and metallurgy; he urged
landowners to encourage or allow the extraction of minerals from their
soils, and de- creed that if they neglected to do this their soil might
be mined by others by paying them merely a nominal fee. By 1710 Russia
ceased to import iron; before Peter’s death it was exporting it. 22</p>
<p>He brought in foreign artisans and managers, and prodded the Russians
of every rank to learn the industrial arts. An Englishman opened in
Moscow a factory for treating hides and making shoes; Peter commanded
every</p>
<p>CHAP, xm) PETER THE GREAT 401</p>
<p>town in Russia to send a delegation of cobblers to Moscow to learn
the latest methods of making boots and shoes, and held the galleys as a
threat over shoemakers who clung to their old ways. To encourage the
Russian textile industry he wore, after this was functioning, only
native-made cloth, and forbade the Muscovites to buy imported stockings.
Soon the Russians were making good textiles. An admiral shocked
tradition and delighted the Czar by manufacturing silk brocades. A
muzhik developed a lacquer su- perior to any similar product in “Europe”
except the Venetian. Before the reign was over there were 233 factories
in Russia. Some were quite large: the Moscow manufacture of sailcloth
employed 1,162 workers; one textile mill used 742 men; another, 730; one
metallurgical establishment had 683 employees. 23 There had been
factories in Russia before Peter, but not on this scale. Many of the new
plants were started by the government and were later sold to private
management; but even then they received state subsidies, and were
subject to detailed supervision by the government. High protective
tariffs shielded the incipient industries from foreign competition.</p>
<p>To man the factories Peter resorted to conscription. Since there were
few free laborers available, peasants were converted, willy-nilly, into
in- dustrial workers. Manufacturers were empowered to buy serfs from
land- lords, and put them to work in the factories. Large-scale
undertakings were supplied with peasants transferred from state lands
and farms. 24 As in most governmental attempts at rapid
industrialization, the leaders could not wait for the acquisitive
instinct to overcome habit and tradition and lead workers from old
fields and ways to new tasks and disciplines. An industrial serf- dom
was developed, more or less reluctantly by Peter, deliberately by his
successors. Peter apologized in an edict of 1723:</p>
<p>Is not everything done 〔at first〕 by compulsion? That there are</p>
<p>few people willing to go into business 〔industry〕 is true, for our
peo- ple are like children, who never want to begin the alphabet unless
they are compelled by their teachers. It seems very hard to them at
first, but when they have learnt it they are thankful. Already much
thanks- giving is heard for what has already borne fruit. … So in
manufactur- ing affairs we must act and compel, and help by teaching.
25</p>
<p>But industry could not develop without commerce to sell its products.
To encourage commerce Peter raised the social status of the merchant
class. He forced the growth of a great shipbuilding industry at
Archangel and St. Petersburg. He tried (and failed) to establish a
merchant marine to carry Russian goods in Russian ships; the muzhik,
rooted and locked in his land, did not take willingly or ably to the
sea. Within Russia itself trade was discouraged by great distances and
forbidding roads. But rivers</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>abounded, fed by the snows of the north and the rains of the south;
and when the rivers froze they froze so firmly that they, like the
frozen roads, could carry heavy loads. What was needed was to bind these
rivers with canals — to lead the Neva and the Dvina to the Volga, and
the Volga to the Don, and so unite the Baltic and the White Sea with the
Black Sea and the Caspian. Peter laid the foundation of the great
system, and opened in 1708 the link between the Neva and the Volga; but
several reigns had to pass before the network was complete, and
thousands of workers died in the attempt.</p>
<p>War and his multifarious enterprises compelled Peter to raise capital
in quantities unprecedented in Russia. Part of this he secured by giving
the government a monopoly in the production and sale of salt, tobacco,
tar, fats, potash, resin, glue, rhubarb, caviar, even of oak coffins.
These coffins were sold at a profit of four hundred per cent; salt made
a modest one hundred per cent. But the Czar realized that monopolies
discouraged both industry and trade, and after peace was signed with
Sweden he abolished them at one stroke, leaving internal trade free.
Foreign trade remained subject to import and export duties, but it
multiplied almost tenfold be- tween 1700 and Peter’s death in 1725. Most
of it was carried in foreign vessels, and what remained in Russian hands
was hampered by widespread bribery that even Peter’s draconic penalties
could not suppress.</p>
<p>Taxation was exhaustive. A special group of governmental appointees
was charged with devising and administering new taxes. There were taxes
on hats, boots, beehives, rooms, cellars, chimneys, births, marriages,
beards. A tax on households was frustrated by whole and chaotic
migrations; Peter changed it to a tax on “souls” wherever found; this
did not apply to the nobility or the clergy. The revenues of the state
rose from 1,400,000 rubles in 1680 to 8,500,000 in 1724 — of which
seventy-five per cent went to the army and navy. Half of the increase
was unreal, being due to a fifty per cent depreciation of the currency
during Peter’s reign, for he could not resist the temptation to make a
temporary profit by debasing the coinage.</p>
<p>From monarch to muzhik dishonesty clogged the economy, the collec-
tion of taxes, the decisions of the courts, the administration of the
laws. Peter decreed death for all officials who accepted “gifts,” but
one of his aides warned him that if he enforced this decree he would
soon have none but dead officials. He killed some of them nevertheless.
Prince Matvei Gagarin, governor of Siberia, became too conspicuously
rich; he adorned his statue of the Virgin with jewels worth 130,000
rubles; Peter wanted to know how the Virgin got them; when he found out
he had Gagarin hanged. In 1714 several high officials were arrested for
stealing from the government and the people; they included the
vice-governor of St. Peters-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl) PETER THE GREAT 4O3</p>
<p>burg, the head of the state commissary, the head of the admiralty,
the commandants of Narva and Revel, and several senators. Some were
hanged, some were given life imprisonment, some had their noses slit,
some were beaten with rods. When Peter gave the order to halt the
punishment, the soldiers who had administered it begged him, “Father,
allow us to flog a little more, for the thieves 〔have〕 stolen even our
bread.” 26 Corruption continued. A Russian proverb said that Christ
himself would steal if his hands were not tied to the Cross.</p>
<p>Amid this struggle of one will to change the economic and political
life of half a continent, Peter found time to attempt a cultural
revolution too. He hated superstition, and longed to replace it with
education and science. The Russians had heretofore dated the years from
the supposed creation of the world, and had begun them with September.
Peter, in 1 699, brought the Russian calendar in harmony with the
Julian, as used by the Protestant states; hereafter the year was to
begin with January, and be dated from the birth of Christ. The people
complained; how could God have chosen midwinter as the time of Creation?
Peter had his way, but he did not dare adopt the Gregorian calendar,
which Catholic Europe had accepted in</p>
<ol start="1582" type="1">
<li>The elimination of ten days, as required by that “papistical trick,”
would have robbed several Orthodox saints of their holydays.</li>
</ol>
<p>The restless Czar succeeded in the equally difficult enterprise of
reform- ing the alphabet. The Orthodox Church used the old Slavonic
alphabet, but the business classes had adopted an alphabet based on the
Greek. Peter ordered all secular works to be printed in this new form.
He imported printing presses and printers from the Netherlands; he
started (1703) the first Russian newspaper, the Gazette of
St. Petersburg; he ordered and financed the publication of books on
technology and science; he founded the Library of St. Petersburg, and
established the Russian Archives by gathering into the library the
manuscripts, records, and chronicles of the monasteries. He opened
several technical institutes, and ordered the sons of the aristocracy to
enter them. He tried to set up in each province a “mathematical school,”
and in Mosc ow he provided a gymnasium after the German model, to teach
languages, literature, and philosophy; but these schools did not long
survive. In 1724 he organized the Academy of St. Petersburg; to this he
brought such distinguished savants as Joseph Delisle to teach astronomy,
and Daniel Bernoulli for mathematics. On Leibniz’ prompting he
commissioned (1724) Vitus Bering, the Danish navigator, to lead an
expedition to Kamchatka to find out whether Asia and America were
physically united. Bering sailed a fter Peter’s death.</p>
<p>Under Alexis the Russian theater had given only private performances.
Peter licensed a theater on the Red Square and opened it to the
public;</p>
<p>4°4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap. XIII</p>
<p>he imported German players, who presented fifteen tragedies and
comedies, including some of Mofi&amp;re. Foreign musicians were brought
in to provide orchestras; the sonata and the concerto were introduced
into Russia, and Russian secular music took European forms of harmony
and counterpoint. Peter commissioned the purchase of paintings and
statues, chiefly Italian, gathered these and other works into a museum
of art in St. Petersburg, opened the museum to all visitors without
charge, and had refreshments served to them. 27 Foreign painters came to
paint portraits in Western style. Some churches were built during the
reigns of Alexis, hardly any under Peter; architects now found it more
profitable to build palaces.</p>
<p>No great literature flowered during this uprooting revolution;
time</p>
<p>would be needed before the stimulus of Peter would be felt in poetry.
One brave book appeared in the year before Peter’s death. Ivan
Possoshkov’s Book of Poverty and Wealth chided the Russians for
barbarism and il- liter acy, and strongly supported the Czar’s reforms.
“Unhappily,” it said, “our great monarch is almost alone, with ten
others, in pulling upwards, while millions of individuals pull
downwards.” 28 Ivan denounced the op - pression of the peasantry,
demanded an impartial administration of justice by courts free from
class domination, and shocked the Czar by asking that representatives of
all classes be brought together to write a new con- stitution and code
of laws for Russia. A few months after Peter’s death Possoshkov was
arrested; he died in prison in 1726.</p>
<p>in. AFTERMATH</p>
<p>The resistance to Peter’s reforms rose from year to year. The
Russians were accustomed to poverty, suffering, and despotism, but not
even under Ivan the Terrible had they borne such burdens, or paid such
taxes, or died in such numbers not only in battle but in forced labor,
from hunger, cold, exhaustion, and disease. “Misery increases from day
to day,” wrote Peter’s beloved Lefort in 1723; “the streets are full of
people who try to sell their children . . . The government pays neither
the troops, nor the navy, nor the 〔administrative〕 colleges, nor
anybody.” 29 The Czar, bewildered by the growth of poverty amid his
reforms, made it a crime to beg, or to give to beggars, and set up sixty
organizations to distribute charity.</p>
<p>Begging continued, and crime spread. Serfs fleeing from
servitude,</p>
<p>soldiers and conscript laborers deserting their camps at the risk of
their fives, almost ruled the roads. Sometimes they organized themselves
into regiments, several hundred strong, which besieged and captured
cities. “Moscow,” reported a general in 1718, “is a hotbed of
brigandage, every - thing is devastated, the number of lawbreakers is
multiplying, and execu-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>405</p>
<p>tions never stop.” Some streets in Moscow were barricaded by the
citizens, some houses were surrounded with high fences, to keep thieves
out. Peter tried to suppress robbery by severity: captured brigands were
to be hanged, housebreakers were to have their noses cut off to the
bone, etc. The crimi- nals were not deterred. Life was so hard for the
poor that they looked upon capital punishment as hardly distinguishable
from the life imprison- ment of serfdom or forced toil, and they bore
the most appalling tortures with the stoicism of deadened nerves.</p>
<p>Peter was so unpopular that many wondered that no one killed him. The
nobles hated him for compelling them to serve the state, and for raising
up the business classes to prominence and wealth; the peasants hated him
for conscripting them into labor that uprooted them from their homes,
often from their families; churchmen hated him as the Beast of the
Apocalypse, who had made Christ himself the servant of the govern- ment;
nearly all Russians distrusted him for consorting with foreigners and
importing “heathen” ideas; all Russia feared him because of his violence
and savage penalties. Russia did not want to be Westernized; it
abominated the West; to preserve its own national spirit it had to be
“Slavophil.” Desperate revolts broke out in Moscow in 1698, in Astrakhan
in 1705, along the Volga in 1707, and sporadically throughout the empire
and the reign.</p>
<p>Peter symbolized and intensified the conflict by twice returning to
the West. In the fall of 17 n he went to Germany to preside at Torgau
over the marriage of his son. There he received Leibniz, who proposed to
him the establishment of a Russian Academy, of which the polymorphous
philosopher hoped to be president. The Czar was back in St. Petersburg
in January, 1712, but in October, amid a campaign against Sweden, he
took the waters at Carlsbad, and visited Wittenberg. Some Lutheran
clergy- men took him to the house in which Luther had flung an inkwell
at the Devil, and they showed him the ink spot on the wall. They asked
him to write some comment on the wall; he wrote: “The ink is quite
fresh, so that the stor y is evidently not true.” 30 Peter returned to
his new capital in April, 1713. In February, 1716, he was off to the
West again; he visited Germany and Holland, and in May, 1717, reached
Paris, hoping to marry his daughter Elizabeth to Louis XV. Meeting the
seven-year-old King, Peter lifted him up to embrace him; a few days
later, received by Louis before the royal palace, Peter raised him like
an infant and carried him up the steps, setting the court atremble. He
spent six weeks in Paris as a sightseer, absorbing every aspect of the
political, economic, and cultural life of the city. He had his portrait
painted by Rigaud and by Nattier. He visited the aged Mme. de Maintenon
at St.-Cyr. From Paris he went to Spa, and for five weeks he drank the
waters there, for by this time he</p>
<p>40 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>was suffering from a dozen ailments. At Berlin his wife, Catherine,
joined him. She discovered that he had a mistress, but she forgave this
as in the best traditions of European royalty. When they reached
St. Petersburg (October 20, 1716) Peter faced one of the worst crises of
his career.</p>
<p>His son Alexis, to whom he had hoped to bequeath the realm and the
advancement of his reforms, had come to dislike many of those innova-
tions, and the methods by which they were enforced. Physically and
mentally Alexis was the son of Eudoxia rather than of Peter. He was
small, timid, and weak, fond of books, and devoted to the Orthodox
Church, for he had been reared in piety while Peter went off to war and
the West. At the age of nine Alexis saw his mother dismissed to a
convent (1699); when he was eleven he heard the priests mourning the
melting of church bells for cannon; he asked his father why Russians
should go out of Russia to fight for so distant a city as Narva; Peter
was disgusted to find that his heir had no taste for bloodshed.</p>
<p>While Peter busied himself building St. Petersburg, Alexis remained
in Moscow, loving its churches and ancient ways. He resented the
disruption of the patriarchate and the confiscation of monastic property
by the state. His confessor taught him always to defend the church, at
whatever cost. Alexis became the idol and hope of the ecclesiastical and
aristocratic groups that hated Peter’s secularization and Westernization
of Russia, and they waited impatiently for the time when this religious
and manageable youth would succeed to the throne. Peter seldom saw him,
and then usually scolded him, sometimes struck him, as when the Czar
found that the boy had secretly visited his mother in her nunnery. The
youth’s disaffection came near to hatred. He admitted to his confessor
Ignatiev that he wished his father were dead. Ignatiev thought this no
sin. “God will forgive you,” he told Alexis; “we all wish for his death,
because the people have to bear</p>
<p>In 1 708 Peter sent his son to Dresden to study geometry and
fortification. At Torgau in 17 11 Alexis married Princess Charlotte
Christina Sophia of Brunswick-Wolfenbiittel. He could not pardon her
refusal to abandon her Lutheran faith for the Russian Orthodox religion.
He took mistresses, even from brothels, and drank heavily. Shortly after
Charlotte had borne him a child he visited her in the company of a
courtesan. 32 A year later his wife died in childbirth (1715). Peter
summoned him to St. Petersburg in an angry letter containing ominous
words: “I do not spare my own li fe, nor that of any of my subjects; I
will make no exception in your case. You will mend your ways, and you
will make yourself useful to the state; otherwise you shall be
disinherited.” 33 Alexis sought to appease his father by resign - ing
his rights to the throne; he would be satisfied, he said, to lead a
quiet life in the country. Peter felt that this was no solution. On
January 30, 1716, he wrote to Alexis:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>PETER THE GREAT</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>I cannot believe your oath. . . . David said that all men are liars,
so</p>
<p>that 〔even〕 if you wished to keep it you could be dissuaded by
the</p>
<p>long-beards. … It is known to everyone that you hate my deeds,</p>
<p>which I do for the people of this nation, not sparing my health,
and</p>
<p>after my death you will destroy them. For that reason, to stay as you
would like to be, neither fish nor flesh, is impossible. Therefore
either change your character, and without hypocrisy be my worthy
suc-</p>
<p>cessor, or become a monk. Give me immediately an answer. … If</p>
<p>you do not do this, I will treat you as a criminal. 34</p>
<p>Alexis’ friends advised him to become a monk. “A monk’s cowl is not
nailed on a man,” said one of them; “it can be laid aside again.” Alexis
wrote to his father that he was willing to become a monk. Peter
relented, and told him to take half a year to make up his mind. The Czar
went off to the West (February, 1716). On June 29 Peter’s sister Natalia
counseled Alexis to leave Russia and put himself under the protection of
the Emperor. In September Peter wrote to his son from Copenhagen saying
that the half year was up, and that Alexis must enter a monastery at
once, or join his father in Denmark, prepared for military service.
Alexis pretended that he was going to his father; he obtained funds from
Menshikov and the Senate, and proceeded not to Copenhagen but to Vienna
(November 10). He begged the Imperial Vice-Chancellor to secure for him
the protection of the Emperor Charles VI. “My father,” he said, “ is
incredibly wrathful and vengeful, and spares no man; and if the Emperor
gives me back to my father it is all the same as taking my life.” 35 The
Vice -Chancellor sent him to the Castle of Ehrenberg in the Tirol. There
Alexis remained in concealment and disguise, under surveillance but
supplied with all com- forts, and allowed to keep with him his mistress
Afrosinia, dressed as a page. Peter’s agents traced him there; Alexis,
warned, fled to Naples, where he was guarded in the Castel Sa nt’ Elmo.
Peter’s agents found him and urged him to return to Russia in confidence
of his father’s mercy. He con - sented, on condition that Peter allow
him to live with Afrosinia in rural retirement. Peter so promised in a
letter of November 28, 1717. Alexis arranged to have Afrosinia stay in
Italy till she bore her child. On his long journey to Russia he sent her
the tenderest letters.</p>
<p>He reached Moscow at the end of January. On February 3 Peter received
him in a solemn assembly of the leading dignitaries of state and church.
Alexis, kneeling and in tears, asked pardon. Peter granted it, but
disinherited him, and declared Catherine’s son Peter Petrovich, now in
his third year, heir to the throne. Alexis pledged allegiance to the new
Czarevich. Peter now made his pardon conditional on Alexis’ confession
of his accomplices in the opposition to his father’s reforms. Alexis
implicated many; they were</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>in apparent freedom, was installed in a house near the Czar’s palace
in St. Petersburg, and was allotted an annual pension of forty thousand
rubles. He wrote to Afrosinia that his father treated him well and had
invited him to his table. He looked forward to her coming, and to
happiness with her in rural peace.</p>
<p>She arrived in April. She was at once arrested; she was subjected not
to torture but to a severe examination; she broke down, and confessed
that Alexis had rejoiced at news of rebellions against his father, that
he had ex- pressed his intention, on coming to power, to abandon
St. Petersburg and the navy, and to reduce the army to the needs of
defense. This was nothing worse than what Peter already knew, and he
left Alexis at liberty for two months more. Then, spurred on by new
revelations not known to us, he announced that since his pardon of
Alexis had presumed a full confession, and he now had evidence that the
confession had been insincere and incom- plete, he withdrew the pardon.
On June 14 Alexis was arrested, and was confined in the SS. Peter and
Paul Fortress.</p>
<p>On June 19, 1718, after examination by the High Court of Justice, he
was put to the torture for the first time, receiving twenty-five blows
of the knout. He confessed that he had desired his father’s death, and
that his confessor had told him, “We all wish for his death.” He was
confronted with Afrosinia, who repeated what she had told the Czar;
nevertheless he vowed that he would love her till his death. He
admitted, “By degrees not only everything about my father, but his very
person, became odious to me.” He acknowledged that he would have used
the Emperor’s help “to conquer the crown by main force.” 36 On June 24 a
further torture by fifteen blows of the knout drew from him nothing
more. The High Court pronounced him guilty of treason, and condemned him
to death. Alexis begged to be allowed to embrace his mistress before his
execution; we do not know if this was granted him. Peter did not sign
the sentence. Twice again (June 25 and 26) Alexis was interrogated under
torture, the second time in the presence of the Czar and members of the
court; and Lefort later reported, “Though I am not sure of this, I am
assured that his father struck the first blows.” 37 That afternoon
Alexis died in prison, apparently from the effects of torture. One story
says that Catherine bade the doctors open his veins; we cannot say
whether this was an act of mercy or of am- bition for her son. Afrosinia
received a share of Alexis’ property, married</p>
<p>Peter hoped to raise Catherine’s son to succeed him, but the boy died
in 1719. Catherine bore two more sons, Peter and Paul, but both died
before the Czar. He consoled himself with the majestic titles awarded
him after the peace with Sweden* In that year 1721 the Senate and the

<p>Synod conferred the title of empress upon Catherine. After allowing
Rus- sia its one year of peace since the beginning of his active rule,
Peter turned his forces against Persia. He hoped to clear and control a
caravan route to Central Asia, at last to India; his informants told him
that gold could be found on the way; and he anticipated the industrial
possibilities of Cau- casian and Middle Eastern oil. 38 In 1722 he sent
a fleet over the Caspian to attack Persia. It captured Baku and some of
the Persian Caspian coast; but storms destroyed most of the ships,
disease decimated the army, and Peter returned from the campaign of 1724
exhausted, pessimistic, and near death.</p>
<p>He had for years been suffering from syphilis, 39 and from the
medicines taken to cure it. Heavy drinking had made matters worse, and
the excite- ments of war, revolution, revolts, and terroristic violence
had finally ex- hausted his giant physique. In November, 1724, he jumped
into the icy Neva to help rescue sailors on a grounded vessel. He worked
through a whole night in water up to his waist. On the next day he had a
fever, but he survived it, and resumed a heavy schedule of activities.
On January 25 he took to his bed with painful inflammation of the
bladder. Not till</p>
<p>February 2 would he admit that death was upon him. He confessed some
of his sins, and received the sacraments. On the sixth he signed a
proclama- tion freeing all prisoners except those condemned for murder
or offenses against the state. He startled his attendants with his cries
of pain. He called for a slate on which to write his will; but when he
had written only the words “Give all,” the pen fell from his hand. Soon
he lapsed into a coma, which continued thirty-six hours, and from which
he did not awake. He was pronounced dead on February 8, 1725. He was
fifty-two years old.</p>
<p>Russia breathed with relief, as if a long and terrible nightmare had
ended at last. The Kings of Sweden and Poland rejoiced; they expected
Russia to fall into anarchy, and be no longer a danger to the West. The
old medieval Russia raised its head and begged for a return to the past.
The nation had been too violently propelled, and it had been hurt in its
soul and pride by too indiscriminate an imitation of the West. Reaction
was widespread and victorious. Many of the reforms were allowed to die
from lack of support. The administrative bureaucracy was reduced, but
its framework endured till 1917. The nobles regained much of their old
power; they recovered their rights to the timber and minerals on their
lands. The business class, so suddenly elevated by Peter, returned to
its former subjection. Many of the new industries collapsed through
inadequate machinery, or incompetence in labor or management. The
incipient capitalism faded away, and eco- nomic Russia remained for
another two hundred years essentially as she had been before the Petrine
revolution. The commercial reforms had better success; trade with the
West continued to increase. 3 ome improvement of</p>

<p>manners resulted from the contacts with Europe, but the old native
cos- tumes returned under Catherine II (1762-96), and beards came back
into style with Alexander II (1855-81). Corruption continued. Morals
showed no gain, and perhaps Peter’s example of drunkenness,
licentiousness, and brutality left his people morally worse than before.
Only those changes survived that had sunk their roots in time.</p>
<p>Peter was among the less lovable figures of modem history. And yet
his achievement was immense. His failures attest the limitations of
genius as a factor in history, but the mark that he left upon Russia is
a tribute to the power of personality. He gave Russia an army and navy;
he opened the ports that allowed her to trade goods and ideas with the
West; he established mining and metallurgy; he founded schools and an
academy. With one savage pull he drew Russia out of Asia into Europe and
made her a factor in European affairs. Henceforth Europe would have to
reckon more and more with that vast heartland, those hardy, patient,
stoic multitudes, and their imperious and inescapable destiny.</p>
