<p>The Jewish Enclaves</p>
<p>1564-1715</p>
<p>I. THE SEPHARDIM*</p>
<p>T HE survival of the Jews through nineteen centuries of hardship and
revenge is a somber strain in the history of ignorance, hatred, courage,
and resilience. Deprived of their national home, forced to find shelter
in ethnic pockets among unrelenting foes, subject at every turn to
contumely and oppression, to sudden confiscation, expulsion, or
massacre, holding no weapon of defense but patience, subtlety, desperate
resolution, and re- ligious faith, they lived through such adversities
as no other people in history has borne; their will was never broken;
and out of their poverty and grief they raised up poets and philosophers
recalling the Hebrew legislators and prophets who had prepared the
spiritual foundations of the Western world.</p>
<p>In Spain the extinction of the Jews was now apparently complete; they
remained only as a hidden current in the Spanish blood. By 1595 a
Spanish bishop could express satisfaction that converted Jews had been
successfully assimilated by intermarriage, and that their descendants
were now good Christians. 2 The Inquisition did not agree with him. In
1654 ten men were burned in Cuenca and twelve in Granada, in 1660
eighty-one were arrested in Seville, and seven burned, on the charge of
secretly adhering to Jewish rites. 3</p>
<p>In Portugal, especially, many seeming converts ( conversos ,
Marranos) continued to practice and transmit Judaism in the privacy of
their homes; over a hundred of them, as relapsos, fell victims to the
Inquisition between 1565 and 1595. 4 Despite all dangers of detection,
crypto-Jews found pre- carious place in Portuguese life as writers,
professors, merchants, financiers, even as monks and priests. The most
prominent physicians were secret Jews; and at Lisbon the Mendes family
developed one of the greatest bank- ing firms in Europe.</p>
<p>After the absorption of Portugal into Spain (1580), the activity of
the Portuguese Inquisition increased; in the next twenty years there
were fifty</p>

<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>autos-da-fe, with 162 condemnations to death, and 2,979 penitents. A
Franciscan friar, Diogo da Assumgao, aged twenty-five, was burned at
Lisbon (1603) after revealing his conversion to Judaism. 5 Many
Marranos, finding the Portuguese Inquisition more ferocious than the
Spanish, mi- grated to Spain. In 1604, by a bribe of 1,860,000 ducats
paid to Philip III, and lesser bribes to his ministers, they persuaded
the King to obtain from Pope Clement VIII a bull directing the
Portuguese inquisitors to release all their Marrano prisoners with
merely spiritual penances. In one day (January 16, 1605) 410 such
victims were freed. But the efficacy of such bribes diminished with
time, and soon after the death of Philip III (1621) the Portuguese
Terror was renewed. In 1623 a hundred “New Christians” were arrested in
the little town of Montemor o Novo. At Coimbra, the cultural center of
the kingdom, there were 247 such arrests in 1626, 218 in 1629, 247 in
1631. In twenty years (1620-40) 230 Portuguese Jews were burned in
person, 161 in effigy, having escaped; and 4,995 were “reconciled” with
lesser penalties. 6 Risking life and abandoning property, thousands of
Marranos fled from Portugal, as formerly from Spain, to all quarters of
the world.</p>
<p>The great majority of the Sephardic exiles sought refuge in Islam,
and formed or joined Jewish settlements in North Africa, Salonika,
Cairo, Constantinople, Adrianople, Smyrna, Aleppo, and Iran. In these
centers the Jews were subject to political and economic disabilities,
but rarely to physical persecution. Jews rose to prominence not only as
physicians but in affairs of state. Joseph Nassi, a Marrano, was a
favorite of Selim II, and as Duke of Naxos (1566) he received the
revenues of ten islands in the Aegean. 7 A German Jew, Solomon ben
Nathan Ashkenazi, was Turkey’s ambassador to Vienna in 1571, and
negotiated there the peace that for a time ended war with the Porte.</p>
<p>In Italy the fortunes of the Jews fluctuated with the needs and moods
of dukes and popes. In Milan and Naples, ruled by Spain, life was almost
impossible for them; in 1669 an explicit decree expelled them from all
Spanish possessions. In Pisa and Livorno (Leghorn) the Tuscan grand
dukes gave them nearly complete liberty, being anxious to develop the
commerce of these free ports. A charter granted in 1593 to merchants in
these cities was in effect an invitation to Marranos: “We desire that .
. . no Inquisition, Visitation, Denunciation, or Accusal shall be made
against you or your families, even though, during the past, they may
have lived outside our dominions in the guise of Christians, or with the
name of being such.” 8 The plan succeeded; Livorno flourished; and the
Jewish community</p>
<p>4 56 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XVI</p>
<p>there, exceeded in number only by those in Rome and Venice, became
famous for its culture as well as its wealth.</p>
<p>The Venetian Senate, fearing the relationships of the Jews with
Turkey, repeatedly expelled them, and repeatedly allowed them to return
as a valuable element not only in commerce and finance but in industry;
Jewish enterprises in Venice employed four thousand Christian
workingmen. 9 German and Oriental, as well as Sephardic, Jews settled
there, and the Senate protected them from the Inquisition. They lived
nearly all in the Giudecca, or Jewish quart er, but were not confined to
it; this “ghetto” included many rich families, fine homes, and a
luxuriously furnished synagogue built in 1584, and rebuilt in 1655 under
the supervision of the famous architect Baldassare Longhena. The six
thousand Jews of Venice had the highest cultural level of any Jewish
community in this age.</p>
<p>At Ferrara a colony of Marranos from Portugal settled about 1 560,
but it was dispersed in 1581 by order of the Pope, who acted under
pressure by the Portuguese Inquisition. In Mantua the Gonzaga dukes
protected the Jews, but periodically mulcted them with contributions and
“loans”; and in 1610 all Mantuan Jews were compelled to reside in a
walled ghetto whose gates were locked at sunset and opened at dawn. 10
When plague came to Mantua the Jews were accused of having brought it
in; and when, in the War of the Mantuan Succession, the troops of the
Emperor took the city, they sacked the ghetto thoroughly, appropriated
800,000 scudi in jewels and money, and ordered the Jews to leave Mantua
within three days with only such property as they could carry. 11</p>
<p>In Rome, where previously the papacy had usually protected the Jews,
the popes after 15 65, with the exception of Sixtus V, issued a long
suc- cession of hostile decrees. Pius V (1566) commanded all Catholic
powers to enforce to the full the canonical restrictions and
disabilities of the Jews. They were hereafter to be confined to ghettos
physically closed off from the Christian population; they were to wear a
distinctive badge or garb; they were to be excluded from the ownership
of land; and they were not to, have more than one synagogue in any city.
In 1569, in a bull accusing them of usury, procuring, witchcraft, and
magic arts, Pius V directed that all Jews be expelled from the Papal
States, except from the cities of Ancona and Rome. 12 Gregory XIII
(1581) forbade the Christian employment of Jewish physicians, ordered
the confiscation of Hebrew books, and (1584) renewed the compulsion laid
upon the Jews to hear sermons aimed at their conversion. Sixtus V ended
the persecution for a time. He opened the ghetto (1586), allowed the
Jews to reside anywhere in the Papal States, dispensed them from wearing
a distinctive mark or dress, permitted them to print the Talmud and
other Hebrew literature, granted them full free- dom of worship, and
bade the Christians treat the Jews and their synagogues</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>with humane respect. 18 But this Christian pontificate was brief.
Clement VIII renewed the edict of expulsion (1593). By 1640 nearly all
the Jews of Italy were living in ghettos; when stepping outside these
they were to wear some badge of their tribe; they were excluded from
agriculture and the guilds. Montaigne, touring Rome in 1581, described
how the Jews, on their Sabbath, were required to send sixty of their
youths to the Church of Sant’ Angelo in P escheria to hear exhortations
to conversion. 14 John Evelyn saw such a ceremony in Rome (January 7,
1645), and observed that “a conversion is very rare.” Many of the less
pleasant characteristics</p>
<p>In France the Jews were theoretically subject to all the
restrictions</p>
<p>called for by Pius V; actually their importance in industry,
commerce, and finance earned them a tacit toleration. In one of his
ordinances Colbert emphasized the benefits accruing to Marseilles from
the mercantile enter- prises of the Jews. 16 Marrano refugees
established themselves in Bordeaux and Bayonne, and contributed so much
to the economic fife of south- western France that they were allowed to
practice their Judaic rituals with less and less concealment. When an
army of mercenaries invaded Bordeaux in 1675, the town council feared
that the exodus of frightened Jews would cripple the prosperity of the
city; without them, reported a sous-intendant, “the trade of Bordeaux
and of the whole province would be inevitably ruined.” 16 Louis XIV took
the Jewish community at Metz under his pro - tection; when local
magistrates tortured to death (1670) a Jew accused of ritual child
murder, the King condemned the execution as judicial slaughter, and
ordered that henceforth criminal charges against Jews were to be brought
before the royal Council. 17 Toward the end of Louis’ reign, wh en the
War of the Spanish Succession had brought the French government close to
bankruptcy, Samuel Bernard, a Jewish financier, put his fortune at the
King’s disposal; and the proud monarch was grateful for the aid of “the
greatest banker in Europe.” 1 8</p>

<li>THE DUTCH JERUSALEM</li>
</ol>
<p>The migration of the Jews from Spain and Portugal played a part
(some- times exaggerated) 19 in the passage of commercial leadership
from those countries to the Netherlands. There the exiled Jews went
first to Antwerp; but in 1549 Charles V ordered the expulsion from the
Low Countries of all Marranos who had entered from Portugal in the
preceding five years. The burgomasters of Antwerp pleaded for exemption
from this edict; it</p>
<p>458 the AGE OF LOUIS XIV (chap. XVI</p>
<p>was enforced, and the new immigrants resumed their search for a home.
Antwerp lost its commercial prominence not from this partial migration
but through the disasters that befell the city in the war of liberation
and the Treaty of Westphalia, which closed the Scheldt to
navigation.</p>
<p>The imperfect but growing freedom of religion in the United Provinces
attracted Jews to the Dutch towns — The Hague, Rotterdam, Haarlem, and,
above all, Amsterdam. Marrano Jews appeared there in 1593; four years
later they opened a synagogue. Hebrew was their language in wor- ship,
Spanish or Portuguese in their daily life. In 1615, after a report drawn
up by Hugo Grotius, the city authorities formally authorized the Jewish
community, granting freedom of worship but forbidding intermarriage with
Christians and attacks upon the Christian religion; 20 hence the trepi-
dation of the synagogue leaders when the heresies of Uriel Acosta and
Baruch Spinoza touched the fundamentals of the Christian creed.</p>
<p>The Jews included some of the wealthiest merchants in the thriving
port. They managed a substantial segment of Dutch trade with the Spanish
Peninsula, and with the East and West Indies. On one occasion, at the
wedding of a Jewish girl, forty of the guests had fortunes totaling
forty million florins. 21 In 1688, when Stadholder William III was
planning his expedition to capture the crown of England, Isaac Suasso,
we are told, advanced him two million florins w ithout interest, saying,
“If you are fortunate, you will repay them to me; if not, I am willing
to lose them.” 22 Some of this wealth was made too conspicuous; David
Pinto adorned his home so gaudily that the civic authorities reproved
him; 23 we should add, however, that the Pinto family gave millions to
Jewish and Christian chari- ties. 24 Behind this economic front was a
busy cultural life, with scholars, rabbis, physicians, poets,
mathematicians, and philosophers. Schools pro- vided education, and a
Hebrew printing press founded by Manasseh ben Israel in 1627 issued a
great number of books and pamphlets; for the next two centuries
Amsterdam was to be the center of the Jewish book trade. In 1671-75 the
Portuguese- Jewish community, numbering four thousand families,
signalized its prosperity by building the beautiful synagogue that is
still one of the sights of Amsterdam; Christians, we are told, took part
in the dedication. It was a happy moment in the life of the modem
Jews.</p>
<p>There were spots on this sun. About 1630 Ashkenazic, or Eastern,
Jews* came into Amsterdam from Poland and Germany. They had their own
dialect of German, and set up their own synagogue; they multiplied
rapidly, and aroused much antipathy among the Sephardic Jews, who were
proud</p>
<p>•The name Ashkenaz appears first in Genesis x, 3, as a great
-grandson of Noah; in Jeremiah li, 27, it is the name of a kingdom in
western Asia; among the medieval rabbis, for reasons unknown, it was the
name for Germany; and Ashkenazim became a synonym for the Jews of
Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>of their superior language, culture, dress, and wealth, and looked
upon marriage with an Ashkenazic Jew as almost apostasy. Within the
Sephardic group itself a class division formed: the small trades and
proliferating poor denounced the “millionaires” who controlled the
politics and personnel of the synagogue. “The dollar binds and looses,”
said a contemporary satire; “it raises the ignorant to the chief offices
in the community.” 25 The intel - lectual leaders — Saul Levi Morteira,
Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, and Manasseh ben Israel — were men of ability
and integrity; but they were cautiously conservative in politics,
religion, and morals. They became as dogmatic as the Spanish persecutors
of their forebears, and they exercised a watch- ful inquisition over
potential heresies. 26</p>
<p>Manasseh ben Israel left his mark upon history by reopening England
to the Jews. Born in La Rochelle of Marrano parents recently arrived
from Lisbon, he was brought to Amsterdam in childhood, became a devoted
student in Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, and English, and at
eighteen was chosen preacher of the congregation Neveh Shalom. He
pleased Chris- tians as well as Jews by writing El Conciliador to
reconcile alleged dis- crepancies in the Bible. He had many Christian
correspondents and friends — Huet, Grotius, Christina of Sweden,
Dionysius Vossius, who translated his book into Latin, and Rembrandt,
who etched his portrait in 1636. Above all he attracted the interest of
Christian visionaries because he preached the early coming of a Messiah
who would rule the earth.</p>
<p>For Manasseh was a Cabalist and mystic idealist, who dreamed that
soon the lost ten tribes of Israel would be found and be united, that
they were probably the American Indians, that the Jews would be
readmitted to England and Scandinavia, and that the Holy Land would then
be restored to Israel in full Messianic glory. Puritans of the Fifth
Monarchy sect in England corresponded with Manasseh, and though their
Messiah was not his they welcomed his views on the early coming of the
Kingdom of God. So encouraged, he published (1650) a treatise, Esperanga
de Israel , pleading for the re-entry of Jews into England. For a Latin
translation of this book he wrote a preface addressed to the English
Parliament; he explained that according to Scriptural prophecies the
return of the Jews to their homeland would be preceded by their
dispersion into all countries; he begged the English government to help
realize this preliminary condition by receiving the Jews into England
and letting them freely exercise their religion and build their
synagogues. He expressed the hope that he might be allowed to come to
England to prepare the establishment of a Hebrew community.</p>
<p>Cromwell was favorably disposed. “Great is my sympathy with this</p>
<p>poor people,” he said, “whom God chose, and to whom He gave His Law.”
27 Lord Middlesex, perhaps representing the Parliament, sent a letter of
acknowledgment and thanks “to my dear brother, the Hebrew philoso -</p>
<p>460</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>pher, Manasseh ben Israel.” The English ambassador in Hollan d
visited Manasseh, and was received with Hebrew music and prayer
(August,</p>
<p>1651). But in October Parliament passed a Navigation Act obviously
aimed at Dutch trade; commercial competition led to the First Dutch
War</p>
<p>(1652-54), and Manasseh had to bide hi s time. “Barebone’s
Parliament” ( 1653) received with favor his renewed plea; a safe-conduct
was dispatched to him; when peace came Cromwell seconded the invitation;
and in Oc- tober, 1655, Manasseh and his son crossed to England.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ENGLAND AND THE JEWS</li>
</ol>
<p>Between the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 and the acces-
sion of Cromwell in 1649, no Jews were legally permitted there. Some
Jewish peddlers may have appeared in the villages, some merchants and
physicians in the towns; but nearly all that the Elizabethan knew or
thought of Jews was derived from Christian gossip or literature. From
such sources Marlowe drew his Barabas and Shakespeare his Shylock.</p>
<p>Some critics 28 have thought that Shakespeare wrote The Merchant of
Venice at his company’s suggestion to profit from the storm of anti -
Semitism just aroused in England by the case of Rodrigo Lopez, executed
in 1594 for allegedly trying to poison Queen Elizabeth. Bom in Portugal
of Jewish parents, Lopez settled in London in 1559, and made his way to
prominence in the medical profession. Engaged as physician to the Earl
of Leicester, he was accused of helping him to remove enemies by poison.
In 1586 he became chief physician to the Queen. He treated, among
others, the second Earl of Essex, but earned his enmity by revealing his
ailments to others. About 1590 he joined Francis Walsingham in intrigues
with the court of Spain against Dom Antonio, pretender to the Portuguese
crown, and he received, apparently from agents of Philip II, a diamond
ring then valued at a hundred pounds. In 1593 Esteban da Gama was seized
in Lopez’ house on a charge of conspiring against Antonio; others
were</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>The spread of the Bible, accelerated by the King James Version,
modified anti-Semitism by giving England a closer acquaintance with the
Old Testa- ment. The ideas and feelings of the ancient Hebrews entered
intimately into the thought and phrases of the Puritans. The wars of the
Jews seemed to them to prefigure their own wars against Charles I;
somehow Jehovah the God of Hosts fitted their needs better than the
Prince of Peace de- scribed in the New Testament. Many Puritan regiments
inscribed their b anners with the Lion of Judah, and Cromwell’s
Ironsides marched to battle singing Biblical songs. Accepting the
magnificent literature of the Old Testament as literally the Word of
God, the Puritans felt constrained to acknowledge the Jews as chosen by
God to be the immediate recipients of His revelation; one preacher told
his congregation that the Jews should still be honored as the select of
God; and some Levellers called themselves Jews. 30 Many Puritans
perceived that Christ’s explicit confirmatio n of the Mosaic Law
outweighed Paul’s rejection of it and laid upon all Biblical Christians
the obligation to practice that Law; one Puritan leader, Major General
Thomas Harrison, close aide to Cromwell, proposed that the Mosaic Code
be made part of English law. 31 In 1 649 a bill was introduced into the
House of Commons to change the Lord’s day from the pagan Sunday to the
Jewish Sabbath. Now, said the Puritans, the English too were the chosen
people of God.</p>
<p>During the reign of James I (1603-25) a small group of Marranos had
settled in London. At first they attended Christian services, but later
they made little effort to conceal their fidelity to Judaism. Jewish
financiers like Antonio Carvajal shared in meeting the monetary needs of
the Long Parliament and the Commonwealth. 32 When Cromwell came to power
he used Marrano merchants as sources of economic and political
information regarding Holland and Spain. He noted with some envy the
prosperity that had come to Dutch commerce partly through the influx and
inter- national connections of the Jews.<br />
</p>
<p>Soon after Manasseh ben Israel’s arrival in England Cromwell received
him, and put a London residence at his disposal. Manasseh presented a
petition, and circulat ed through the press a “Declaration” stating the
re - ligious and economic case for the admission of Jews into England.
He explained why the Jews, through their legal disabilities and physical
and financial insecurity, had been forced to abstain from agriculture
and take to trade. He pointed out that the Amsterdam Jews lived by
commercial investment rather than by moneylending, that they practiced
no usury, but placed their liquid funds in banks and were satisfied with
five per cent interest on these deposits. He showed the baselessness of
the legend that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in
religious rituals. He assured Christians that Jews made no attempt to
secure converts. He</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>concluded by asking that Jews be admitted to England on condition of
taking an oath of loyalty to the realm; that they receive religious
freedom, and protection from violence; and that their internal disputes
be settled by their rabbis and laws without prejudice to English law and
interests.</p>
<p>On December 4, 1 655, Cromwell assembled at Whitehall a conference of
jurists, officials, and clergymen to consider the admission of the Jews.
He himself defended the idea with force and eloquence, stressing not the
economic but the religious aspect: the pure Gospel must be preached to
the Jews, but “can we preach to them, if we will not tolerate them among
us?” 33 His arguments met with little sympathy. The clergymen insisted
that Jews had no place in a Christian commonwealth; representatives of
commerce objected that Jewish merchants would deflect trade and wealth
from English hands. The conference voted that Jews could not settle in
England “except by private sufferance of His Highness.” 34</p>
<p>Public opinion was predominantly hostile to admission. Rumors were
spread that the Jews, if allowed into England, would turn St. Paul’s Ca
- thedral into a synagogue. William Prynne, who had made a stir twenty-
seven years earlier by his Historiomastix attack upon the English
theater, issued (1655-56) a Short Demurrer renewing old charges that the
Jews were counterfeiters of coinage and murderers of children. A
passionate Puritan, Thomas Collyer, answered Prynne, but weakened his
case by urging that the Jews be honored as the chosen people of God.
Manasseh himself published (1656) a Vindication appealing to the English
people’s sense of justice. Could they really believe “that strange and
horrid accusa - tion . . . that the Jews are wont to celebrate the Feast
of Unleavened Bread 〔by〕 fermenting it with the blood of some
Christians whom they have for that purpose killed?” He showed how often
in history such</p>
<p>accusations had been made by false witnesses, or supported only by
con- fessions under torture, and how often the innocence of Jews so
accused had been brought to light after their execution. He concluded
with touch- ing faith and fervor:</p>
<p>And to the highly honored nation of England I make my most</p>
<p>humble request, that they would read over my arguments
impartially,</p>
<p>. . . effectually recommending me to their grace and favor, and earn-
estly beseeching God that He would be pleased to hasten the time</p>
<p>promised by Zephaniah, wherein we shall all serve Him with one</p>
<p>consent, after the same manner, and shall be all of the same
judgment; that as His name is one, so His fear may be also one, and that
we may all see the goodness of the Lord (blessed forever! ) and the
consola- tions of Zion. 35</p>
<p>The English people were not won over by this plea, and Manasseh ob-
tained no formal admission of the Jews. Cromwell, absorbed in
protecting</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>his government and his life, put the problem aside; however, he
awarded Manasseh a yearly pension of a hundred pounds (which was never
paid) out of the public treasury. In September, 1657, Manasseh’s son
died. With the aid of a grant from the Protector he took the body to
Holland for burial. Exhausted with travel and grief, the Apostle to
England died at Middelburg November 20, leaving not enough money to pay
for his own funeral.</p>
<p>He had not really failed in his mission. Evelyn’s Diary remarks,
under December 14, 1655, “Now were the Jews admitted.” No decree of th e
Protector, no enactment of Parliament, legalized their return; but more
and more of them came in with the tacit approval of Cromwell. In 1657 he
allowed the Jews of London to establish their own burial ground, not as
Christians but as Jews; soon thereafter they opened a synagogue and
quietly practiced their ritual. When the Restoration came, Charles II
re- membered the financial support given him in his Dutch exile by
Mendes da Costa and other Hebrews; he perceived the advantages that had
already accrued to England from the mercantile enterprises of the London
Jews; and he winked an eye on further immigration. William III, also
recalling Jewish help, continued this tolerant attitude, despite the
repeated com- plaints of English merchants and clergymen. Solomon Medina
earned the first Jewish knighthood by his services as army contractor
for William III and Marlborough. 36 By 1715 Jewish brokers were on the
London Ex- change, and Jewish financiers were a minor power in the land.
In 1904 the English Jews celebrated the tercentenary of Manasseh’s
birth.</p>

<p>Despite medieval crusades and a thousand vicissitudes, there remained
in 1564 substantial Jewish settlements in Germany, above all in
Frankfurt- am-Main, Hamburg, and Worms. But the Reformation had
intensified rather than moderated the Christian hatred of the strange
people that could not accept Christ as the Son of God. At Frankfurt the
Jews were forbidden to leave the ghetto except on urgent business, and
could not receive out- of-town guests without the knowledge of the
magistrates; their clothing had to have a special mark or color; their
houses were to bear distinctive emblems, often grotesque. Bribery of
town officials sometimes bought exemptions from these humiliations, but
the hostility of simple folk was a perpetual menace to Jewish life and
property. So in September, 1614, while most Frankfurt Jews were at
prayer, a Christian crowd forced an entry into the ghetto; after
enjoying a night of plunder and destruction, it compelled 1,380 Jews to
leave the city with no other belongings than the clothes on their backs.
Several Christian families sheltered and fed the</p>
<p>4&lt;*4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>fugitives; and the Archbishop of Mainz compelled the municipality of
Frankfurt to restore them to their homes, to indemnify them for their
losses, and to hang the leader of the mob. 37 A year later, at Worms, a
similar uprising drove the Jews from the city and desecrated their syna-
gogues and cemeteries; but the Archbishop of Worms and the Landgrave of
Hesse-Darmstadt gave refuge to the exiles, and the Elector Palatine
protected their return. In general the higher clergy and classes were
in- clined to toleration, but the lower clergy and the masses were
easily stirred to the ecstasy of hate. Old disabilities, even when
relaxed, always hung over Jewish heads, and insult and injury were the
possibilities of any day. Some ardent Ch ristians snatched Jewish
infants from their mothers’ breasts and forcibly baptized them. 88 If
there were no ignorance there would be no history.</p>
<p>The Thirty Years’ War left the Jews of Germany relatively unharmed.
Protestants and Catholics were so engrossed in mutual murder that they
almost forgot to kill Jews, even when these had lent them money. The
Emperor Ferdinand I had imposed burdensome regulations upon the Jews of
Austria, and had expelled them from Bohemia (1559); but Ferdinand II
protected them, allowed them, in Catholic Vienna, to build a synagogue
and discard the badge, and permitted the return of Jews to Bohemia. The
Bohemian Jews pledged forty thousand gulden yearly to the Imperial cause
in the great war. To soothe Christians who complained of his tolerant
policy, Ferdinand II (1630) ruled that the Jews of Prague should listen
every Sunday to Christian sermons, and fines were levied for truancy or
sleeping.</p>
<p>v the Peace of Westphalia the Hebrew settlements in Germany ex-
panded rapidly. The excesses of the war had in some measure discredited
bigotry and persecution; hundreds of Jews came in from Poland after the
pogroms that followed the Cossack revolt of 1648. Between 1675 and 1720
an annual average of 648 Jewish merchants attended the Leipzig fairs.
German princes found uses for Jewish skill in the management of finances
and the organization of supplies for armies and courts. So Samuel Oppen-
heimer superintended the Imperial fisc during the campaigns that closed
the seventeenth century, and Samson Wertheimer supervised the Imperial
commissariat in the War of the Spanish Succession. The influence of the
Spanish-born and Jesuit-inspire«H£mpress Margaret Theresa upon her hus-
band Leopold I resulted in the banishment of the Jews from Austria, but
the Great Elector Frederick William welcomed many of the exiles into
Brandenburg, and the Jewish community in Berlin grew into one of the
largest in Europe.</p>
<p>Ever since the twelfth century the Jews of Central Europe had
been</p>
<p>developing their own Yiddish ( Jiidisch ) dialect, composed mostly of
Ger-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE JEWISH ENCLAVES 465</p>
<p>man words with Hebrew and Slavic additions, and written in Hebrew
characters. Literate Jews continued to study Hebrew, but the secular
pub- lications of the Ashkenazim became predominantly Yiddish. A Yiddish
literature arose, rich in wry humor and domestic sentiment, in folk
tales transmitted across centuries and frontiers, in Purimspiele, or
playlets for the gay spring festival, and in proverbs of homely wisdom
(“One father supports ten children, but ten children do not support one
father”). 89 Before 1715 this literature could boast of only one notable
author, Elijah Bochur, a scholar in Hebrew and a poet in Yiddish, who
wrote fantastic romances in ottava rima, and rendered the Psalms into
popular speech. A Yiddish version of the Pentateuch appeared in 1544,
only fifteen years after Luther’s German Bible, and a Yidd ish
translation of the entire Old Testament was published at Amsterdam in
1676-79. The German Jews were on their way to the cultural leadership of
their people.</p>
<p>Jews had entered Poland from Germany in the tenth century. Despite an
occasional massacre they prospered and increased under the protection of
the government. In 1501 there were some fifty thousand Jews in Poland;
in 1648, half a million. 40 The gentry (szlachta) controlling the Sejm
sup- ported the Jews, because landlords found them especially competent
in collecting rents and taxes, and managing estates. With some
exceptions, the rulers of Poland in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries were among the most liberal monarchs of their time. Stephen
Bathory issued two edicts confirming the commercial rights of the Jews,
and branding ritual-murder charges as cruel “calumnies” not to be
admitted in Polish courts (1576). 41 But popular animosity remained.
Only a year after these edicts a mob at- tacked the Jewish quarter in
Poznan, pillaged homes, and killed many Jews. Bathory imposed a fine
upon the city officials for having failed to stop the riot. Sigismund
III continued royal toleration.</p>
<p>Two factors contributed to end this era of governmental good
will.</p>
<p>German merchants in Poland resented Jewish competition; they fomented
popular outbreaks in Poznan and Wilno, where a synagogue was demol-
ished and the houses of Jews were sacked (1592); and they submitted to
the King a petition de non tolerandis Judaeis (1619). The Jesuits,
brought in by Bathory, and soon taking intellectual lead of the
Catholics in Poland, joined in the campaign to discontinue toleration.
Accusations of ritual mur- der now won governmental recognition. In 1
598, at Lublin, the corpse of a boy having been found in a swamp, three
Jews were forced by torture to confess that they had slain him; they
were hanged, drawn, and quartered; and the body, preserved in a Catholic
church, became an object of religious veneration. Anti-Semitic
literature grew in ferocity.</p>
<p>In 1618 Sebastian Michinski of Cracow published A Mirror of the
Polish</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Crown, in which he charged the Jews with child murder, witchcraft,
rob- bery, swindling, and treason, and called upon the Sejm to expel all
Jews from Poland. The pamphlet aroused such public feeling that
Sigismund ordered its suppression. A Polish physician accused Jewish
doctors of systematically poisoning Catholics (1623). King Ladislas IV
directed</p>
<p>municipal authorities to protect the Jews against popular uprisings,
and tried to lessen Christian hostility by forbidding Jews to take homes
in Christian neighborhoods, or to build new synagogues, or open new
ceme- teries, without royal license. The Sejm of 1643 required all
merchants to limit themselves to a maximum profit of seven per cent if
they were Chris- tians, three per cent if they were Jews; the result was
that Christians bought from the Jews, who prospered and incurred more
hate.</p>
<p>Despite hatred, restrictions, tribulations, and poverty, the Polish
Jews multiplied. They built temples and schools, transmitted their
stabilizing traditions, morals, and laws, and cherished their comforting
faith. Elemen- tary schools were organized by private teachers paid by
the parents per pupil and term; for pupils who could not pay, most
Jewish communities maintained a school from public funds. Attendance at
elementary school was compulsory for boys from their sixth to their
thirteenth year. Higher education was provided in a college ( yeshibah )
under rabbinical control. A contemporary rabbi describes the system
(1653):</p>
<p>Every Jewish community supported bahurs (college students),</p>
<p>giving them a certain amount of money per week. . . . Every one
of</p>
<p>these bahurs was made to instruct at least two boys. … A community of
fifty Jewish families would support no less than thirty of these</p>
<p>young men and boys, one family supplying board for one college</p>
<p>student and his two pupils, the former sitting at the family table
like one of the sons. . . . There was scarcely a house . . . where the
Torah was not studied, and where either the head of the family or his
son or his son-in-law, or the yeshibah student boarding with him, was
not an expert in Jewish learning. 42</p>
<p>From our later and secular standpoint the education and literature of
Polish Jewry was narrowly rabbinical, being almost confined to the
Talmud, the Bible, the Cabala, and Hebrew. But since the Talmud
contained Jewish law as well as Jewish religion and history, it served
as a severe and deepening discipline of the mind; and the harassed
communities doubtless felt that only an intense religious faith, and a
study rooted in the traditions and mores of the tribe, could generate
the strength to bear persistent contumely, perse- cution, hardship, and
insecurity. The Polish Jews remained medieval until modernity became
modem enough to give them liberty — or death.</p>
<p>The year 1648 brought them a terrible reminder of their precarious
status</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>in Christendom. In the revolt that then flared up among the Cossacks
against their Polish or Lithuanian landlords, the Jews who had served as
stewards and taxgatherers for the estates bore the brunt of the
rebellion. In Pereya- slav, Piryatin, Lubny, and other towns thousands
of Jews were massacred, whether or not they had served the nobility.
Some survived by accepting conversion to the Greek Orthodox faith, some
by taking refuge among the Tatars, who sold them as slaves. The pent-up
resentment of the Cossacks ran mad in incredible ferocity. Says a
Russian historian:</p>
<p>Killing was accompanied by barbarous tortures: the victims were</p>
<p>flayed alive, split asunder, clubbed to death, roasted on coals,
or</p>
<p>scalded with boiling water. . . . The most terrible cruelty,
however,</p>
<p>was shown to the Jews. They were destined to utter annihilation, and
the slightest pity shown to them was looked upon as treason. Scrolls of
the Law were taken out of the synagogues by Cossacks, who danced on them
while drinking whiskey. After this Jews were laid upon them and
butchered without mercy. Thousands of Jewish infants were</p>
<p>thrown into wells, or buried alive. 43</p>
<p>In one city alone, Niemirov, 6,000 Jews were said to have perished in
this revolt. At Tulchyn 1,500 Jews were rounded up in a park, and were
offered a choice between conversion and death; if one may believe the
Jewish chronicler 1,500 chose death. In the town of Polonnoye, we are
told, io,ooo(?) Jews were killed by Cossacks or taken prisoner by
Tatars. Lesser pogroms raged in other Ukrainian towns. When the
Cossacks, faced by the Polish army, allied themselves with Russia
(1654), Muscovite troops joined Cossacks in killing or expelling the
Jews of Moghilev, Vitebsk, Wilno, and other cities taken from the
Lithuanians or the Poles.</p>
<p>In 1 655 the invasion of Poland by Charles X of Sweden created
another problem for the Jews. Like many Poles, they accepted the Swedish
con- queror without resistance, as a savior from the dreaded Russians.
When a new Polish army rose and drove out the Swedes, it massacred the
Jews throughout the provinces of Poznan, Kalisz, Cracow, and Piotrkow,
ex- cepting the city of Poznan itself. Altogether, these disasters of
1648-58 in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia were, till our own time, the
bloodiest in the history of the European Jews, exceeding in terror and
mortality the mas- sacres of the Crusades and the Black Death. A
conservative estimate has reckoned 34,719 Jewish lives lost, and 531
Jewish communities wiped out. 44 It was this tragic decade that began
the mass migration of Jews from Slavic lands into Western Europe and
North America, .resulting in a com- plete redistribution of Jewish
population on the globe.</p>
<p>In Poland the surviving Jews returned to their homes and patiently
re- built their devastated communities. King John Casimir declared his
resolve</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>to compensate his Jewish subjects, so far as he could, for the
calamaties they had borne; he gave them new charters of rights and
protection, and tempo- rary exemption from taxes in those centers that
had suffered most. But popular and theological hostility remained,
graced now and then with Christian commiseration. In 1660 two rabbis
were executed on the old charge, so repeatedly repudiated by the popes,
of ritual murder; and in 1663 a Jewish apothecary at Cracow, on the
unproved accusation that he had written a diatribe against worship of
the Virgin Mary, suffered death in the barbarous sequence ordered by the
court: his lips were cut off, his hand was burned, his tongue was cut
out, and his body was burned at the stake. 46 The general of the
Dominican order sent from Rome (February 9, 1664) a letter urging the
Dominican monks of Cracow “to defend the hapless Jews from every calumny
invented agai nst them.” 46 At Lvov the pupils of a Jesuit academy
invaded the Jewish quarter, killed a hundred Jews, de- molished houses,
and desecrated synagogues (1664); but at Wilno Jesuit students protected
Jews from riotous mobs (168 2). 47 The generous Sobieski (1674-96)
labored to comfort the Jews of Poland: he reaffirmed their vio- lated
rights, freed them from the jurisdiction of municipal authorities sub-
ject to popular passions, and gave sympathetic audience to the syndics
who presented the petitions of the Jews to his court. By the end of his
reign the Polish Jews had recovered, in number, from the bitter decade,
but the horror of it remained for generations in Hebrew memory.</p>
<p>Legally there were no. Jews in Russia before 1772. Ivan the Terrible
gave his view of them in answering a request from Sigismund II that
Lithuanian Jews be admitted to Russia for business purposes (1550):</p>
<p>It is not convenient to allow Jews to come with their goods to</p>
<p>Russia, since many evils result from them. For they import poisonous
herbs into our realm, and lead astray the Russians from Christianity.
Therefore he, the King, should no more write about these Jews 48</p>
<p>When Russian troops occupied the Polish border city of Polotsk
(1565), Ivan sent orders to have all local Jews converted or drowned. In
the war of 1654 with Poland the Russians were astonished to find many
cities in Lithuania and the Ukraine with entire sections populated by
Jews. They murdered some of these “dangerous heretics,” and took others
prisoner to Moscow, where these became the nucleus of a small and
illegal Jewish colony. In 1698 Peter the Great, in Holland, received
through the burgo- master of Amsterdam a petition from some Jews to
allow them to enter Russia. He replied:</p>
<p>My dear Witsen, you know the Jews, and you know their character</p>
<p>and habits; you also know the Russians. I know both; and believe
me,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>469</p>
<p>the time has not yet come to unite the two nationalities. Tell the
Jews that I am obliged to them for their proposal, and that I realize
how</p>
<p>advantageous their services would be to me, but I should have pity on
them were they to live in the midst of the Russians. 49</p>
<p>This Russian policy of Jewish exclusion continued till the first
partition of Poland (1772).</p>
<p>V. THE INSPIRATIONS OF FAITH</p>
<p>To understand the hostility of Christians to Jews, we must go back
into the mind of the medieval Catholic and the Reformation Protestant.
They remembered the Crucifixion, but they did not remember the large
crowds of Jews that had heard Christ gladly and had welcomed him into
Jerusalem. They thought of Jesus as the Anointed One, the Son of God;
but the Jews could not see in Christ the Messiah promised by their
prophets, the savior who would free them from bondage and make them
again a nation erect and free. It was difficult for Christians to look
with brotherly tolerance upon a minority whose monotheism was no distant
rivalry like that of Mohammedanism, but a passionate cry, heard from
synagogues multiply- ing in Christendom itself — “Hear, O Israel!
Adonai, our God, is One!” That proud Semitic creed was felt as an ever
present challenge to the funda- mental Christian belief that the Son of
Man who had died on the Cross was in full truth the Son of God, whose
infinite sacrifice had atoned for man’s sins, and had opened the gates
of Paradise. Could anything in life be more precious and sustaining than
that faith?</p>
<p>To protect that faith the Christians of Europe sought to isolate the
Jews with geographical barriers, political disabilities, intellectual
censorship, and economic restraints. Nowhere in Christian Europe before
the French Revolution — not even in Amsterdam — were they allowed full
citizenship and its rights. They were shut out from public office, the
army, the schools and universities, and the practice of law in Christian
courts. They were heavily taxed, they were subject to forced loans, they
might at any time suffer confiscation of their property /They were
excluded from agriculture by restrictions on the ownership’of land, and
by the haunting insecurity that forced them to put their savings in
currency or movable goods. They were ineligible to the guilds, for these
were partly religious in form and purpose, and required Christian oaths
and rituals. Limited to petty indus- try, to commerce and finance, they
found themselves harassed even in these occupations by special
prohibitions varying in place and changeable at any time: in one
district they could not be peddlers, in another they could not</p>
<p>470</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>be shopkeepers, in another they must not deal in leather or wool . 60
So most Jews lived as small tradesmen, peddlers, dealers in secondhand
goods or old clothes, tailors, servants of their richer fellow men,
craftsmen making goods for Jews. From these occupations, and the
humiliations of the ghetto, the poorer Jews developed those habits of
dress and speech, those tricks of trade and qualities of mind, that were
so distasteful to other peoples and higher ranks.</p>
<p>Above this lowly majority were the rabbis, physicians, merchants, and
financiers. The activity of Jewish exporters and importers played a sig-
nificant part in the prosperity of Hamburg and Amsterdam. One twelfth of
England’s foreign trade passed through Jewish hands in the first half of
the seventeenth century . 51 Jews predominated in the import of gems and
textiles from the East. The Jews profited, in international commerce,
from their family relations in divers states, and their superior
knowledge of languages; they had their own channels of information,
which guided them, occasionally, to anticipations profitable on the
bourse . 52 These foreign connections enabled them to develop letters of
credit and bills of ex- change . 53 The Jews, of course, were not the
inventors of modem capital- ism; we have seen that system grow quite
independently of them, and rather in manufacturing than in finance; and
even in finance they played a minor role as compared with the Medici of
Florence, the Grimaldi of Genoa, or the Fuggers of Augsburg. Jewish
moneylenders charged high rates of interest, but no higher than
Christian bankers facing equal risks.</p>
<p>The Jewish mind, sharpened by hardship, oppression, and study, devel-
oped in trade and finance an acquisitive subtlety never forgiven by
their competitors. The ethics of the Jews, like those of the Puritans,
placed no stigma upon wealth; the rabbis recognized it as the support of
charity, the sinews of the synagogue, and the last resort to buy off
persecuting kings or populace. Nevertheless it is true that in the
Jewish communities of Hol- land, Germany, Poland and Turkey there were
men who made the making of money not only their tribe’s protection but
their soul’s delight, who used more craft than conscience in amassing
it, who gave to their fellow men the corrosive spectacle of great wealth
tarnished with conspicuous luxury, and only partly redeemed by
substantial charities. Around them, in tbe ghetto, a third of their
fellows lived in a poverty that only charity kept this side of
starvation . 54</p>
<p>The religion of the Jews, like their character, suffered from the
poverty, introversion, and contumely of ghetto life. The rabbis, who in
the Middle Ages had been men of courage and wisdom, became in this age
devotees of a mysticism that fled from the hell of persecution and
penury into a heaven of compensatory dreams. The Talmud in the Middle
Ages had replaced the Bible as the soul of Judaism; now the Cabala
replaced the</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>471</p>
<p>Talmud. A Frankfurt author of the seventeenth century alleged that in
his day there were many rabbis who had never seen a Bible. 55 Solomon
Luria (1510-72) marked the transition; he began with the Talmud, and
based upon it his Yam shel Shelomo ( Sea of Solomon ), but even his
subtle mind finally succumbed to the Cabala. This was the “Secret
Tradition” of</p>
<p>medieval Jewish mystics who believed that they had found a divine
revela- tion concealed in the symbolism of numbers, letters, and words,
above all in the letters composing Yahveh’s ineffable name. Scholar
after scholar in the ghetto lost himself in such fancies, until one of
them declared that he who neglects the esoteric wisdom of the Cabal
deserves excommunication. 56 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
says the chief of modem Jewish historians, “the parasitic Kabbala choked
the whole religious life of the Jews. Almost all rabbis and leaders of
Jewish communities . . . were en- snared” by it, from Amsterdam to
Poland to Palestine. 67</p>
<p>To the Jews so dispersed, and so often destitute and maligned, the
prop of life was the faith that someday soon the real Messiah would come
to raise them out of misery and ignominy to power and glory. It is
pitiful to see how, in century after century, some impostor or fanatic
was accepted by the Jews as this long-awaited savior. We have seen
elsewhere how, in 1524, David Reubeni of Arabia was hailed by
Mediterranean Hebrews as the Messiah, though he himself made no such
pretense. Now, in 1648, a Jew of Smyrna, Sabbatai Zevi, announced that
he was the promised Re- deemer.</p>
<p>Physically he seemed to be an admirable choice: tall, shapely,
handsome, with the fine black hair and beard of a Sephardic youth. 58
Drawn to the Cabala by the writings of Solomon Luria, he subjected
himself to an ascetic regimen in the hope that this would make him
worthy of the Secret Tradi- tion in its fullest revelation. He mortified
his body, bathed frequently in the sea at all seasons, and kept himself
so clean that his followers celebrated the fragrance of his flesh. He
felt no attraction to women; he married early in obedience to Jewish
custom, but his wife soon divorced him for his failure to perform his
marital duties. He married again, with the same result. Young men
gathered about him, admiring the melodious voice in which he sang
Cabalistic songs, and wondering was he not a heaven-sent saint. His
father was one of a group who believed that the Messiah was coming soon
— not later than 1666. Sabbatai heard them predicting that the great
redemption would be effected by a man of pure soul and profound piety,
initiated in the Cabala, and capable of drawing together all good men
into the millen- nium. The thought came to Sabbatai that he, purified by
asceticism, was this divine Redeemer. The Z ohar, the thirteenth-century
text of Cabala, had specified the Jewish year 5408 (a.d. 1648) as
inaugurating the era of</p>
<p>472 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>redemption. In that year Sabbatai, aged twenty-two, proclaimed
himself the Messiah.</p>
<p>A little band of disciples took him at his word. The rabbinate of
Smyrna condemned them as blasphemers; they persisted, and were banished.
Moving to Salonika, Sabbatai performed a Cabalistic ceremony marrying
himself to the Torah; the rabbis of Salonika expelled him. He passed to
Athens; then to Cairo, where he gained a rich adherent, Raphael Chelebi;
then to Jerusalem, where his ascetic practices impressed even the
rabbis. Impover- ished by the cessation of alms from the stricken Jews
of the Ukraine, the Jerusalem community sent Sabbatai to seek aid in
Cairo. He returned to Jerusalem not only with funds but with a third
wife, Sarah, whose beauty shed luster on his claims. At Gaza, on the
way, he received another rich recruit, Nathan Ghazati, who announced
that he himself was Elijah, reborn to make straight the way for the
Messiah, and that within a year the Messiah would overthrow the Sultan
and establish the Kingdom of Heaven. Believ- ing him, thousands of Jews
mortified their bodies to atone for their sins and be worthy of the
earthly paradise. Back in Smyrna, Sabbatai in 1665 entered the synagogue
on the Jewish New Year, and again declared himself the Messiah. Now he
was accepted by a multitude delirious with joy. When an old rabbi
denounced him as an impostor Sabbatai had him banished from Smyrna.</p>
<p>Throughout western Asia the news that the Messiah had come
electrified the Jewish communities. Merchants from Egypt, Italy,
Holland, Germany, and Poland brought the glad tidings back to their
lands, and told of the miracles that in rising number were ascribed to
Sabbatai. A few Jews were skeptical, but thousands, prepared by
Cabalistic prophecies and ardent hopes, believed. Even some Christians
shared in the exultation, saying that the Smyrna Messiah was really the
reborn Christ. Henry Oldenburg, writ- ing to Spinoza from London
(December, 1665) reported: “All the world here is talking of a rumor of
the return of the Israelites, dispersed for more than two thousand
years, to their own country. Few believe it, but many wish it … . Should
the news be confirmed, it may bring about a revolution in all things.”
59 In Amsterdam prominent rabbis declared for Sabbatai; the coming of
the Kingdom was celebrated in the synagogue with music and dance; prayer
books were printed to teach believers the penances and chants
preparatory to entering the Promised Land. In the Hamburg synagogue
Jewish worshipers of all ages hopped, jumped, and danced with the scroll
of the Law in their hands. In Poland many Jews abandoned their homes and
property and refused to work, saying that the Messiah would soon come in
person and lead them in triumph to Jerusalem. 60 Thousands of Jews —
sometimes whole communities, like that of Avignon — made ready to move
to Palestine. At Smyrna some enthusiasts, excited by the world-</p>

<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>wide homage to their leader, proposed that Jewish prayers henceforth
be addressed not to Yahveh, but to “the first -begotten Son of God,
Sabbatai Zevi, Messiah and Redeemer” (so Christians prayed more often to
Christ or the Virgin than to God). Word was sent out from Smyrna that
the Jewish holy days of mourning were hereafter to be celebrated as
feasts of joy, and that soon all the laborious prescriptions of the Law
were to be abrogated in the security and happiness of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Apparently Sabbatai had himself come to believe in his miraculous</p>
<p>powers. He announced that he was going to Constantinople, presumably
to fulfill the prophecy of Ghazati that the Messiah would peacefully
take the crown of the Ottoman Empire (including Palestine) from the
Sultan. (Some said, however, that the cadi, or Turkish magistrate, in
Smyrna had ordered him to present himself before high officials in the
capital.) Before leaving Smyrna, Sabbatai divided the world and its
government among his most faithful aides. With a band of disciples in
his train, he set out on Janu- ary i, 1666. He had predicted the day of
his arrival, but a tempest delayed his vessel; his companions turned the
miscalculation into an added proof of his divinity by telling how, with
a divine word, he had stilled the storm.</p>
<p>When he landed on the shore of the Dardanelles he was arrested, was
brought in fetters to Constantinople, and was put in prison. Two months
later he was transferred to a milder confinement at Abydos. His wife was
allowed to join him; his friends came from all quarters to comfort him,
to do him homage, and to bring him funds. His followers did not lose
faith in him; they pointed out that according to the best predictions
the Messiah would be at first rejected by the secular authorities, who
would subject him to sufferings and indignities. Throughout Europe the
Jews expected that at any moment he would be released, and would realize
happier prophecies. His initials, S and Z, were posted in synagogues. In
Amsterdam, Leghorn, and Hamburg Jewish business came almost to a
standstill, so warm was the belief that soon all Jews would be returned
to the Holy Land. Jews who expressed doubt that Sabbatai was the Messiah
were in daily peril of their lives.</p>
<p>Puzzled by the excitement that was disturbing the economic life
of</p>
<p>many Ottoman communities, and yet afraid that the execution of
Sabbatai as a rebel and impostor would sanctify him as a martyr and turn
his move- ment into a costly rebellion, the Turkish authorities decided
to try a peace- ful solution. Sabbatai was taken to Adrianople. There he
was told that a decree condemned him to be dragged through the streets
and scourged with burning torches; this, however, he could avoid, and he
would acquire high honors in Islam, by accepting conversion to the
Mohammedan faith. He agreed. On September 14, 1666, he appeared before
the Sultan, and confirmed his apostasy by removing his Jewish garments
and donning</p>
<p>474</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Turkish dress. The Sultan gave him the name Mehmed Effendi, and ap-
pointed him his doorkeeper, with a handsome salary. Sarah, also
converted, received rich gifts from the Sultana.</p>
<p>The news of this apostasy was greeted with incredulity by the Jews of
Asia, Europe, and Africa; but when at last it was established it almost
broke the heart of Jewry. The leading rabbi of Smyrna, who after much
doubt had accepted Sabbatai, nearly died of shame. Jews became
everywhere the butt of Moslem and Christian ridicule. Sabbatai’s aides
sought to comfort his followers by explaining that the conversion was
part of his subtle plan to win Mohammedans to Judaism, and that soon he
would reappear as a Jew, with all Islam in his train. Sabbatai obtained
permission to preach to the Jews of Adrianople, assuring the Turkish
authorities that he would convert his auditors to Islam; at the same
time he issued secret messages to the Jews that he was still the
Messiah, and that they must not lose faith in him. But neither at
Adrianople nor elsewhere did the Jews give any sign of accepting
Mohammed. Disappointed, the Ottoman government deported Sabbatai to
Ulcinj in Albania, where no Jews dwelt. There in 1676 the broken Messiah
died. For half a century believers continued his movement, affirming his
sanctity, and promising his resurrection from the dead.</p>

<li>HERETICS</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing that in Jewish communities encompassed by unrelenting ene-
mies religion was the prop of life and the life of the Law, the rabbis
dis- couraged secular studies that might open a cranny to religious
doubt. Joel Sirkis, chief rabbi at Cracow, condemned philosophy as the
mother of heresy, the fatal “harlot” of whom Solomon had said, “None
that go unto her return again”; 61 and he proposed to excommunicate any
Jew within his jurisdiction who became addicted to philosophy. Joseph
Solomon Del- medigo, coming to Poland (1620) from an Italy still warm
with the Renais- sance, was dismayed by the exclusion of science from
the curriculum and reading of the Jews. “Behold,” he wrote, “darkness
covers the land, and the ignorant are numerous, . . . saying, The Lord
takes no delight in the sharpened arrows of the grammarians, poets, and
logicians, nor in the meas- urements of the mathematicians, and the
calculations of the astronomers.” 62</p>
<p>Delmedigo was the great-grandson of the Elijah del Medigo who had
taught Hebrew in the circles of the Medici. He began his deviations by
learning Greek as well as the Talmud from his father, a rabbi in Crete;
and he obtained some scientific education at the progressive University
of Padua, where Galileo was his tutor. He took up the practice of
medicine, which gave him a living and his Italian name; but science —

<p>475</p>
<p>above all — continued to lure him, and in its pursuit he shed some of
his religious faith. Such molting leaves a sensitive skin, and may for a
time un- settle character. Uprooted and restless, Joseph moved from city
to city. Transiently he attached himself at Cairo and Constantinople to
the Karaite sect, Jews who (like the Protestants) rejected
ecclesiastical traditions and emendations and clung to the Bible as the
sole source of their theology. In Hamburg and Amsterdam he found his
medical knowledge so far behind that of the Jewish physicians there that
for bread’s sake he turned orthodox, joined the rabbinate, and finally
defended the Cabala. He died as an obscure physician in Prague
(1655).</p>
<p>Leo ben Isaac Modena was a subtler and profounder spirit. He took his
Italian name from the town to which his family had migrated in the
expul- sion of the Jews from France. He was a child prodigy, reading the
Prophets in his third year, preaching in his tenth, and writing his
first published work at thirteen. It was a dialogue against gambling, on
which Leo was an authority, for he remained its devotee to the end of
his life. Greatest of his gambles was his marriage in 1590, aged
nineteen. Of his three sons one died at twenty-six, one was killed in a
brawl, one took to dissipation and disappeared in Brazil. One of his two
daughters died during his lifetime; the other, having lost her husband,
became dependent upon her father, whose wife became insane. Amid these
buffets Leo was excommunicated for per- sistent gambling at cards. He
wrote a dissertation proving that the rabbis had gone beyond the Law in
their decree, which was soon revoked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had mastered Biblical, Talmudic, and rabbinical
literature, had studied physics and philosophy, and had written in
Hebrew and Italian some passable poetry. Admitted to the rabbinate in
Venice, he de- livered Italian addresses of such learning and eloquence
that many Christians were drawn to his audience. One of his Christian
friends, an English</p>
<p>nobleman, engaged him to write an Italian exposition of Jewish
ritual. In preparing this Historia dei rid ebraici (1637), Leo came to
the conclusion that many of the traditional ceremonies, now divorced
from their original purpose, had lost much of their significance. In an
anonymous work, Kol Sakai, he proposed that Hebrew prayers and rites be
revised and simplified, the dietary laws abrogated, and the holydays
reduced in number and austerity. In this same book he criticized
rabbinical Judaism as a mass of unwarranted complications added to the
authentic Jewish Law; he urged a return from the Talmud to the Bible,
but he extended his heresies to the Bible itself, even to the entire
Mosaic revelation. He left this revolutionary pronunciamento
unpublished; and when it was found among his papers after his death
(1648), it was accompanied by a companion treatise defend- ing orthodox
Judaism. Neither saw print till 1852. Had Leo dared to pub-</p>
<p>47 &lt;5 the age of louis xiv (chap, xvi</p>
<p>lish Kol Sakai in his lifetime, Reform Judaism might have begun in
the seventeenth century. He was too clever to anticipate history.</p>
<p>The most tragic of the Jewish heretics was Uriel Acosta of Amsterdam.
His father came of a Marrano family that had settled in Oporto and had
fully adjusted itself to the Catholic faith. Gabriel, as the youth was
called in Portugal, was educated by the Jesuits, who terrified him with
sermons on hell but sharpened his mind with Scholastic philosophy.
Studying the Bible, he was impressed by the fact that the Church
recognized the Old Testa- ment as the Word of God, and that Christ and
the twelve Apostles had accepted the Mosaic Law. He concluded that
Judaism was divine; he ques- tioned the right of St. Paul to divorce
Christianity from Judaism; and he resolved at the first opportunity to
return to the faith of his ancestors. He persuaded his mother and his
brothers (his father was now dead) to join in an attempt to elude the
Inquisition and escape from Portugal. After many perils they reached
Amsterdam (c. 1617). There Gabriel changed his name to Uriel, and the
family became members of the Portuguese congregation.</p>
<p>But the same spirit of inquiry and independent thought that had led
him to leave the Church made him uncomfortable within the equally
rigorous dogmas of the synagogue. He was shocked by the addiction of
even the learned rabbis of Amsterdam to the intellectual puerilities of
the Cabala. He boldly reproved his new associates for rites and
regulations that had no apparent basis in the Bible, and that sometimes,
in his judgment, ran quite counter to Biblical ways. As he had little
sense of history, he thought it a great mistake that Jewish ritual and
belief had altered in the course of nine- teen hundred years. As
formerly he had returned from the New Testament to the Old, so now he
urged a return from theTalmud to the Bible. In 1616 he had published at
Hamburg a Portuguese tract, Propostas contra a tradigao — arguments
against the traditions upon which the Talmud was based. He sent a copy
to the Jewish congregation in Venice; it proclaimed a ban against him
(1618); and Leo Modena, himself a heretic, was required, by his po
sition in the rabbinate, to refute Acosta’s claim that the ordinances of
the rabbis had in many cases no warrant in Scripture. The Amsterdam
rabbis, whom he called Pharisees, warned Acosta that they too would ban
him unless he retracted. He refused, and openly ignored the regulations
of the synagogue. Excommunication was pronounced against him (1623), ex-
cluding him from all relations with his fellow Jews. Even his relatives
now shunned him; and as he had not yet learned Dutch, he found himself
with- out a single friend. Children stoned him in the streets.</p>
<p>In the bitterness of his isolation he proceeded (like Spinoza a
generation later), to a heresy that attacked a fundamental belief of
nearly every person in Europe. He let it be known that he rejected, as
quite alien to the Old Testament, the immortality of the soul; the soul,
he said, is merely the vital</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE JEWISH ENCLAVES</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>spirit flowing in the blood, and dies with the body. 63 Seeking to
answer Acosta’s contentions, a Jewish physician, Samuel da Silva,
published a Por - tuguese Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul
(1623), in which he called Acosta ignorant, incompetent, and blind.
Uriel countered with An Exam- ination of the Pharisaic Traditions . . .
and a Reply to Samuel da Silva, the False Calumniator (1624). The
leaders of the Jewish community, to pro- tect its religious freedom,
notified the Amsterdam magistracy that Acosta, in denying immortality,
was undermining Christianity as well as Judaism. The magistrates
arrested him, fined him three hundred gulden, and burned his book. He
was soon released, and apparently suffered no physical harm.</p>
<p>His punishment was economic and social. His younger brothers became
dependent upon him, and therefore upon his freedom — now forbidden — to
engage in economic relations with his fellows. Perhaps for this reason,
and because he wished to marry again, Uriel decided to submit to the
syna- gogue, to recant his heres ies, and, as he put it, “to become an
ape among apes.” 64 His recantation was accepted (1633), and for a time
the passionate skeptic lived in relative peace. But secretly his
heresies continued, and broadened. “I doubted,” he later wrote, “whether
Moses’ Law was in reality God’s law, and decided that it was of human
origin.” 65 Now he cast aside all religion except a vague belief in a
God identical with nature (as in Spinoza). He neglected the burdensome
religious usages required of an orthodox Jew. When two Christians came
to him and professed a desire to adopt Judaism, he dissuaded them,
warning them that they were laying a heavy yoke upon their necks. They
reported this to the synagogue. The rabbis summoned and questioned him;
they found him unrepentant, and now they pronounced against him a second
and severer excommunication (1639). Again his relatives excluded him
from their lives, and his brother Joseph joined in persecuting him.
66</p>
<p>He bore this isolation for seven years, and then, finding himself
griev- ously hampered in business and law, he offered to submit. Angered
by his long and troublesome resistance, the Jewish leaders condemned him
to a form of recantation and penance imitated from the Portuguese
Inquisition. 67 As in an auto-da-fe, he was made to mount a platform in
the synagogue, to read before a full congregation a confession of his
errors and sins, and to solemnly promise that henceforth he would obey
all regulations of the community, and live as a true Jew. Then he was
stripped to the waist and was scourged with thirty-nine stripes. Finally
he was made to lie across the threshold of the synagogue, and those
present, including his hostile brother, stepped over him as they
left.</p>
<p>He rose from this humiliation not reconciled but furious. Going home,
he shut himself up in his study for several days and nights, and wrote
his last and bitterest denunciation of the Judaism which he had
sacrificed much</p>
<p>478</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>to adopt, but whose introverted history, and protective rigorism
under centuries of oppression, he had never sympathetically understood.
In this sarcastic Exemplar humanae Vitae he told his intellectual
autobiography as an example of what happens to the man who thinks. “All
evils,” he felt, “come from not following Right Reason and the Law of
Nature .” 68 He contrasted “natural” with revealed religion, and claimed
that the latter taught men hatred as the former taught men love. Having
finished his manuscript, he loaded two pistols, waited at his window
till he saw his brother Joseph pass, fired at him, and missed . 69 Then
he shot himself (1647?).</p>
<p>The Jewish community tried to bury this tragedy in silence, but some
members must have found it hard to forget. Spinoza was a lad of fifteen
when that excommunication rite was performed; he may have been in the
congregation that saw it performed; he may have walked in awe and horror
over the prostrate heretic. Through that youth the vision of Acosta,</p>
<p>cleansed of its anger, entered into the heritage of philosophy .
