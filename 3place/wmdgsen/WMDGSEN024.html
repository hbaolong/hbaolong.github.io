Poets</h4>
<p>I. china’s BISMARCK</p>
<p>The Period of Contending States — The suicide of Ch’u P’ing —</p>
<p>Shih Huang-ti unifies China — The Great Wall — The “ Burn -</p>
<p>ing of the Books”— The failure of Shih Huang-ti</p>
<p>P RESUMABLY Confucius died an unhappy man, for philosophers</p>
<p>love unity, and the nation that he had sought to unite under some</p>
<p>powerful dynasty persisted in chaos, corruption and division. When
the great unifier finally appeared, and succeeded, by his military and
admin- istrative genius, in welding the states of China into one, he
ordered that all existing copies of Confucius’ books should be
burned.</p>
<p>We may judge the atmosphere of this “Period of the Contending</p>
<p>States” from the story of Ch’u P’ing. Having risen to promise as a
poet and to high place as an official, he found himself suddenly
dismissed. He retired to the countryside, and contemplated life and
death beside a quiet brook. Tell me, he asked an oracle,</p>
<p>whether I should steadily pursue the path of truth and loyalty,
or</p>
<p>follow in the wake of a corrupt generation. Should I work in the</p>
<p>fields with spade and hoe, or seek advancement in the retinue of
a</p>
<p>grandee? Should I court danger with outspoken words, or fawn</p>
<p>in false tones upon the rich and great? Should I rest content in
the</p>
<p>cultivation of virtue, or practise the art of wheedling women in</p>
<p>order to secure success? Should I be pure and clean-handed in my</p>
<p>rectitude, or an oil-mouthed, slippery, time-serving sycophant? 1</p>
<p>He dodged the dilemma by drowning himself (ca. 350 b.c.); and until
our own day the Chinese people celebrated his fame annually in the
Dragon- boat Festival, during which they searched for his body in every
stream. The man who unified China had the most disreputable origin
that</p>
<p>he Chinese historians could devise. Shih Huang-ti,’ we are informed,
was the illegitimate son of the Queen of Ch’in (one of the western
states)</p>
<p>694</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE AGE OF THE POETS 695</p>
<p>by the noble minister Lii, who was wont to hang a thousand pieces of
gold at his gate as a reward to any man who should better his composi-
tions by so much as a single word/ (His son did not inherit these
literary tastes.) Shih, reports Szuma Ch’ien, forced his father to
suicide, persecuted his mother, and ascended the ducal throne when he
was twelve years of age. When he was twenty-five he began to conquer and
annex the petty states into which China had so long been divided. In 230
b.c. he con– quered Han; in 228, Chao; in 225, Wei; in 223, Ch’u; in
222, Yen; fi nally, in 221, the important state of Ch’i. For the first
time in many centuries, perhaps for the first time in history, China was
under one rule. The con- queror took the title of Shih Huang-ti, and
turned to the task of giving the new empire a lasting constitution.</p>
<p>“A man with a very prominent nose, with large eyes, with the
chest</p>
<p>of a bird of prey, with the voice of a jackal, without beneficence,
and with the heart of a tiger or a wolf”— this is the only description
that the</p>
<p>Chinese historians h ave left us of their favorite enemy.” He was a
robust and obstinate soul, recognizing no god but himself, and pledged,
like some Nietzschean Bismarck, to unify his country by blood and iron.
Having forged and mounted the throne of China, one of his first acts was
to pro- tect the country from the barbarians on the north by piecing
together and completing the walls already existing along the frontier;
and he found the multitude of his domestic opponents a convenient source
of recruits for this heroic symbol of Chinese grandeur and patience. The
Great Wall, 1500 miles long, and adorned at intervals with massive
gateways in the Assyrian style, is the largest structure ever reared by
man; beside it, said Voltaire, “the pyramids of Egypt are only puerile
and useless masses.”* It took ten years and countless men; “it was the
ruin of one generation,”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Shih Huang-ti, like Napoleon, turned with pleasure from war
to administration, and created the outlines of the future Chinese state.
He accepted the advice of his Legalist prime minister, Li Ssii, and re-
solved to base Chinese society not, as heretofore, upon custom and local
autonomy, but upon explicit law and a powerful central government. He
broke the power of the feudal barons, replaced them with a nobility of
functionaries appointed by the national ministry, placed in each
district</p>
<p>6g6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>a military force independent of the civil governor, introduced
uniform laws and regulations, simplified official ceremonies, issued a
state coinage, divided most of the feudal estates, prepared for the
prosperity of China by establishing peasant proprietorship of the soil,
and paved the way for a completer unity by building great highways in
every direction from his capital at Hien-yang. He embellished this city
with many palaces, and persuaded the 1 20,000 richest and most powerful
families of the em- pire to live under his observant eye. Traveling in
disguise and unarmed, he made note of abuses and disorders, and then
issued unmistakable orders for their correction. He encouraged science
and discouraged letters.’</p>
<p>For the men of letters — the poets, the critics, the philosophers,
above all the Confucian scholars — were his sworn foes. They fretted
under his dictatorial authority, and saw in the establishment of one
supreme govern- ment an end to that variety and liberty of thought and
life which had made literature flourish amid the wars and divisions of
the Chou Dynasty. When they protested to Shih Huang-ti against his
ignoring of ancient ceremonies, he sent them curtly about their
business. 8 A commission of mandarins , or official scholars, brought to
him their unanimous suggestion that he should restore the feudal system
by giving fiefs to his relatives; and they added: “For a person, in any
matter, not to model himself on antiquity, and yet to achieve duration —
that, to our knowledge, has never happened.’” The prime minister, Li
Ssii, who was at that time engaged in reforming the Chinese script, and
establishing it approximately in the form which it retained till our own
time, met these criticisms with an historic speech that did no service
to Chinese letters:</p>
<p>The Five Sovereigns did not repeat each other’s actions, the
Three</p>
<p>Royal Dynasties did not imitate each other;… for the times had</p>
<p>changed. Now your Majesty has for the first time accomplished</p>
<p>a great work and has founded a glory which will last for ten
thou-</p>
<p>sand generations. The stupid mandarins are incapable of under-</p>
<p>standing this…. In ancient days China was divided up and trou-</p>
<p>bled; there was no one who could unify her. That is why all the</p>
<p>nobles flourished. In their discourses the mandarins all talk of
the</p>
<p>ancient days, in order to blacken the present…. They encour-</p>
<p>age the people to forge calumnies. This being so, if they are not</p>
<p>opposed, among the upper classes the position of the sovereign will
be depreciated, while among the lower classes associations will</p>
<p>flourish….</p>

<p>I suggest that the official histories, with the exception of the</p>
<p>Memoirs of Ch’in, be all burnt, and that those who attempt to
hide</p>
<p>he Shi-Ching, the Shu-Ching,* and the Discourses of the Hundred</p>
<p>Schools, be forced to bring them to the authorities to be burnt.
8</p>
<p>The Emperor liked the idea considerably, and issued the order;
the</p>
<p>books of the historians were everywhere brought to the flames, so
that the weight of the past should be removed from the present, and the
his- tory of China might begin with Shih Huang-ti. Scientific books, and
the works of Mencius, seem to have been excepted from the conflagration,
and many of the forbidden books were preserved in the Imperial Library,
where they might be consulted by such students as had obtained official
permission.’ Since books were then written on strips of bamboo fastened
with swivel pins, and a volume might be of some weight, the scholars who
sought to evade the order were put to many difficulties. A number of
them were detected; tradition says that many of them were sent to labor
on the Great Wall, and that four hundred and sixty were put to death. 1
* Nevertheless some of the literati memorized the complete works of Con-
fucius, and passed them on by word of mouth to equal memories. Soon
after the Emperor’s death these volumes were freely circulated again,
though many errors, presumably, had crept into their texts. The only
permanent result was to lend an aroma of sanctity to the proscribed
litera- ture, and to make Shih Huang-ti unpopular with the Chinese
historians. For generations the people expressed their judgment of him
by befouling his grave.”</p>
<p>The destruction of powerful families, and of freedom in writing
and</p>
<p>speech, left Shih almost friendless in his declining years. Attempts
were made to assassinate him; he discovered them in time, and slew the
assailants with his own hand.” He sat on his throne with a sword across
his knees, and let no man know in what room of his many palaces he w
ould sleep.” Like Alexander he sought to strengthen his dynasty by
spreading the notion that he was a god; but as the comparison limped,
he, like Alex- ander, failed. He decreed that his dynastic successors
should number themselves from him as “First Emperor,” down to the ten
thousandth of their line; but the line ended with his son. In his old
age, if we credit the historians who hated him, he became superstitious,
and went to much expense to find an elixir of immortality. When he died,
his body was Cf. p. 665 below*</p>

<p>brought back secretly to his capital; and to conceal its smell it was
con- voyed by a caravan of decaying fish. Several hundred maidens (we
are told) were buried alive to keep him company; and his successor,
grateful for his death, lavished art and money upon the tomb. The roof
was</p>
<p>studded with constellations, and a map of the empire was traced in
quick- silver on the floor of bronze. Machines were erected in the vault
for the automatic slaughter of intruders; and huge candles were lit in
the hope that they would for an indefinite period illuminate the doings
of the dead emperor and his queens. The workmen who brought the coffin
into the tomb were buried alive with their burden, lest they should live
to reveal the secret passage to the grave. 14</p>

<p>Chaos and poverty — The Han Dynasty — The reforms of Wu Ti —</p>

<p>— Its overthrow — The Tatar invasion</p>
<p>Disorder followed his death, as it has followed the passing of almost
every dictator in history; only an immortal can wisely take all power
into his hands. The people revolted against his son, killed him soon
after he had killed Li Ssii, and put an end to the C h’in Dynasty within
five years after its founder’s death. Rival princes established rival
kingdoms, and disorder ruled again. Then a clever condottiere, Kao-tsu,
seized the throne and founded the Han Dynasty, which, with some
interruptions and a change of capital,* lasted four hundred years. Wen
Ti (179-57 B - c -) restored freedom of speech and writing, revoked the
edict by which Shih Huang-ti had forbidden criticism of the government,
pursued a policy of peace, and inaugurated the Chinese custom of
defeating a hostile gen- eral with gifts. 15</p>
<p>The greatest of the Han emperors was Wu Ti. In a reign of over
half</p>
<p>a century (140-87 b.c.) he pushed back the invading barbarians, and
ex- tended the rule of China over Korea, Manchuria, Annam, Indo-China
and Turkestan; now for the first time China acquired those vast
dimensions which we have been wont to associate with her name. Wu Ti
experi- mented with socialism by establishing national ownership of

<p>The “Western Han” Dynasty, 206 b.c — 24 aj&gt;., had its capital at
Lo-yang, now Honan- fu; the “Eastern Han” Dynasty, 24 - 221 aj&gt;., had
its capital at Ch’ang -an, now Sian-fu. The Chinese still call
themselves the “Sons of Han.”</p>

<p>sources, to prevent p rivate individuals from “reserving to their
sole use the riches of the mountains and the sea in order to gain a
fortune, and from putting the lower classes into subjection to
themselves.” 11 ’ The pro - duction of salt and iron, and the
manufacture and sale of fermented drinks, were made state monopolies. To
break the power of middlemen and speculators — “those who buy on credit
and make loans, those who buy to heap up in the towns, those who
accumulate all sorts of commodities” as the contemporary his torian,
Szuma Ch’ien expressed it— Wu Ti estab- lished a national system of
transport and exchange, and sought to control trade in such a way as to
prevent sudden variations in price. State work- ingmen made all the
means of transportation and delivery in the empire. The state stored
surplus goods, selling them when prices were rising too rapidly, buying
them when prices were falling; in this way, says Szuma Ch’ien, “the rich
merchants and large shop -keepers would be prevented from making big
profits,… and prices would be regulated throughout the empire.” 17 All
incomes had to be registered with the government, and had to pay an
annual tax of five per cent. In order to facilitate the pur- chase and
consumption of commodities the Emperor enlarged the supply of currency
by issuing coins of silver alloyed with tin. Great public works were
undertaken in order to provide employment for the millions whom private
industry had failed to maintain; bridges were flung across China’s
streams, and innumerable canals were cut to bind the rivers and irrigate
the fields. 18 *</p>
<p>For a time the new system flourished. Trade grew in amount, variety
and extent, and bound China even with the distant nations of the Near
East.” The capital, Lo -yang, increased in population and wealth, and
the coffers of the government were swollen with revenue. Scholarship
flour- ished, poetry abounded, and Chinese pottery began to be
beautiful. In the Imperial Library there were 3,123 volumes on the
classics, 2,705 on</p>
<p>philosophy, 1,318 on poetry, 2,568 on mathematics, 868 on medicine,
790 on war.” Only those who had passed the state examinations were
eligible * “The situation,” says Granet,.. was revolutionary. If the
Emperor Wu had had some kindred spirit, he might have been able to
profit by this and create, in a new order of society, the Chinese
State…. But the Emperor only saw the most urgent needs. He seems only to
have thought of using varied expedients from day to day — rejected when
they had yielded sufficient to appear worn out — and new men —
sacrificed as soon as they had succeeded well enough to assume a
dangerous air of authority. The restlessness of the despot and the short
vision of the imperial law-makers made China miss the rarest opportunity
she had had to become a compact and organized state.” 19</p>
<p>700 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>o public office, and these examinations were open to all. China had
never prospered so before.</p>
<p>A combination of natural misfortunes with human deviltry put an end
to this brave experiment. Floods alternated with droughts, and raised
prices beyond control. Harassed by the high cost of food and clothing,
the people began to clamor for a return to the good old days of an</p>
<p>idealized past, and proposed that the inventor of the new system
should be boiled alive. Business men protested that state control had
diminished healthy initiative and competition, and they objected to
paying, for the support of these experiments, the high taxes levied upon
them by the government. 23 Women entered the court, acquired a secret
influence over important functionaries, and became an element in a wave
of official corruption that spread far and wide after the death of the
Emperor. 33 Counterfeiters imitated the new currency so successfully
that it had to be withdrawn. The business of exploiting the weak was
resumed under a new management, and for a century the reforms of Wu Ti
were for- gotten or reviled.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our era — eighty-four years after Wu Ti ’s
death</p>
<p>— another reformer ascended the throne of China, first as regent, and
then as emperor. Wang Mang was of the highest type of Chinese gentle-
man.* Though rich, he lived temperately, even frugally, and scattered
his income among his friends and the poor. Absorbed in the vital</p>
<p>struggle to reorganize the economic and political life of his
country, he found time nevertheless not only to patronize literature and
scholar- ship, but to become an accomplished scholar himself. On his
accession to power he surrounded himself not with the usual politicians,
but with men trained in letters and philosophy; to these men his enemies
attributed his failure, and his friends attributed his success.</p>
<p>Shocked by the development of slavery on the large estates of China,
Wang Mang, at the very outset of his reign, abolished both the slavery
and the estates by nationalizing the land. He divided the soil into
equal tracts and distributed it among the peasants; and, to prevent the
renewed concentration of wealth, he forbade the sale or purchase of
land. 35 He continued the state monopolies of salt and iron, and added
to them state ownership of mines and state control of the traffic in
wine. Like Wu Ti he tried to protect the cultivator and the consumer
against the merchant by fixing the prices of commodities. The state
bought agricultural sur-</p>

<p>pluses in time of plenty, and sold them in time of dearth. Loans were
made by the government, at low rates of interest, for any productive
enterprise.”</p>
<p>Wang had conceived his policies in economic terms, and had forgotten
the nature of man. He worked long hours, day and night, to devise</p>
<p>schemes that would make the nation rich and happy; and he was heart-
broken to find that social disorder mounted during his reign. Natural
calamities like drought and flood continued to disrupt his planned</p>
<p>economy, and all the groups whose greed had been clipped by his
reforms united to plot his fall. Revolts broke out, apparently among the
people, but probably financed from above; and while Wang, bewildered by
such ingratitude, struggled to control these insurrections, subject
peoples weak- ened his prestige by throwing off the Chinese yoke, and
the Hsiung-nu barbarians overran the northern provinces. The rich Liu
family put</p>
<p>itself at the head of a general rebellion, captured Chang-an, slew
Wang Mang, and annulled his reforms. Everything was as before.</p>
<p>The Han line ended in a succession of weak emperors, and was fol-</p>
<p>lowed by a chaos of petty dynasties and divided states. Despite the
Great Wall the Tatars poured down into China, and conquered large areas
of the north. And as the Huns broke down the organization of the Roman
Empire, and helped to plunge Europe into a Dark Age for a hundred years,
so the inroads of these kindred Tatars disordered the life of China, and
put an end for a while to the growth of civilization. We may judge the
strength of the Chinese stock, character and culture from the fact that
this disturbance was much briefer and less profound than that which
ruined Rome. After an interlude of war and chaos, and racial mixture
with the invaders, Chinese civilization recovered, and enjoyed a
brilliant resurrection. The very blood of the Tatars served, perhaps, to
reinvig- orate a nation already old. The Chinese accepted the
conquerors, married them, civilized them, and advanced to the zenith of
their history.</p>

<p>hrone by the abdication of his father, a second Kao-tsu, who had
estab- lished the T’ang Dynasty nine years before. He began
unprepossessingly by murdering the brothers who threatened to displace
him; and then he exercised his military abilities by pushing back the
invading barbarians into their native haunts, and reconquering those
neighboring territories which had thrown off Chinese rule after the fall
of the Han. Suddenly he grew tired of war, and returning to his capital,
Ch’ang -an, gave him- self to the ways of peace. He read and re-read the
works of Confucius, and had them published in a resplendent format,
saying: “By using a mirror of brass you may see to adjust your cap; by
using antiquity as a mirror you may learn to foresee the rise and fall
of empires.” He refused</p>
<p>One day he visited the jails of Ch’ang -an, and saw two hundred
and</p>
<p>ninety men who had been condemned to die. He sent them out to till
the fields, relying solely on their word of honor that they would
return. Every man came back; and T’ai Tsung was so well pleased that he
set them all free. He laid it down then that no emperor should ratify a
death sentence until he had fasted three days. He made his capital so
beautiful that tourists flocked to it from India and Europe. Buddhist
monks arrived in great numbers from India, and Chinese Buddhists, like
Yuan Chwang, traveled freely to India to study the new religion of China
at its source. Missionaries came to Ch’ang -an to preach Zoroastrianism
and Nestorian Christianity; the Emperor, like Akbar, welcomed them, gave
them pro- tection and freedom, and exempted their temples from taxation,
at a time when Europe was sunk in poverty, intellectual darkness, and
theological strife. He himself remained, without dogma or prejudice, a
simple Con- fucian. “When he died,” says a brilliant historian, “the
grief of the people knew no bounds, and even the foreign envoys cut
themselves with knives and lancets and sprinkled the dead emperor’s bier
w ith their self-shed blood.” 3 *</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE AGE OF THE POETS 703</p>
<p>He had paved the way for China’s most creative age. Rich with
fifty</p>
<p>years of comparative peace and stable government, she began to export
her surplus of rice, corn, silk, and spices, and spent her profits on
unparalleled luxury. Her lakes were filled with carved and painted
pleasure-boats; her rivers and canals were picturesque with commerce,
and from her harbors ships sailed to distant ports on the Indian Ocean
and the Persian Gulf. Never before had China known such wealth; never
had she enjoyed such abundant food, such comfortable houses, such
exquisite clothing. 20 While silk was selling in Europe for its weight
in gold, 00 it was a routine article of dress for half the population of
the larger cities of China, and fur coats were more frequent in eighth-
century Ch’ang -an than in twentieth-century New York. One village near
the capital had silk factories employing a hundred thousand men.” “What
hospitality!” exclaimed Li Po, “what squandering of money! Red jade cups
and rare dainty food on tables in- laid with green gems!” 32 Statues
were carved out of rubies, and pretentious corpses were buried on beds
of pearl.” The great race was suddenly</p>
<p>enamored of beauty, and lavished honors on those who could create it.
“At this age,” says a Chinese critic, “whoever was a man was a poet.” 01
Emperors promoted poets and painters to high office, and “Sir John Man -
ville”* would have it that no one dared to address the Emperor save “it
be mynstrelles that singen and tellen gestes.”” In the eighteenth
century of our era Manchu emperors ordered an anthology to be prepared
of the T’ang poets; the result was thirty volumes, containing 48,900
poems by 2,300 poets; so much had survived the criticism of time. The
Imperial Library had grown to 54,000 volumes. “At this time,” says
Murdoch,</p>
<p>“China undoubtedly stood in the very forefront of civilization. She
was then the most powerful, the most enlightened, the most progressive,
and the best- governed, empire on the face of the globe. 08 “It was the
most polished epoch that the world had ever seen.”f</p>
<p>At the head and height of it was Ming Huang — i.e., “The Brilliant Em
- peror”— v/ho ruled China, with certain intermissions, for some forty
years (713-56 a.d.). He was a man full of human contradictions: he
wrote</p>
<p>poetry and made war upon distant lands, exacting tribute from
Turkey,</p>

<p>Persia and Samarkand; he abolished capital punishment and reformed
the administration of prisons and courts; he levied taxes mercilessly,
suffered poets, artists and scholars gladly, and established a college
of music in his “Pear Tree Garden.” He began his reign like a Puritan,
closing the silk factories and forbidding the ladies of the palace to
wear jewelry or em- broidery; he ended it like an epicurean, enjoying
every art and every luxury, and at last sacrificing his throne for the
smiles of Yang Kwei-fei.</p>
<p>When he met her he was sixty and she was twenty-seven; for ten years
she had been the concubine of his eighteenth son. She was corpulent and
wore false hair, but the Emperor loved her because she was obstinate,
capricious, domineering and insolent. She accepted his admiration gra-
ciously, introduced him to five families of her relatives, and permitted
him to find sinecures for them at the court. Ming called his lady “The
Great Pure One,” and learned fr om her the gentle art of dissipation.
The Son of Heaven thought little now of the state and its affairs; he
placed all the powers of government in the hands of the Pure One’s
brother, the</p>
<p>An Lu-shan, a Tatar courtier, also loved Yang Kwei-fei. He won
the</p>
<p>confidence of the Emperor, who promoted him to the post of provincial
governor in the north, and placed under his command the finest armies in
the realm. Suddenly An Lu-shan proclaimed himself emperor, and turned
his armies toward Ch’ang -an. The long-neglected defenses fell, and Ming
deserted his capital. The soldiers who escorted him rebelled, slew Yang
Kuo-chung and all the five families, and, snatching Yang Kwei-fei from
the monarch’s hands, killed her before his eyes. Old and beaten, the
Emperor abdicated. An Lu- shan’s barbaric hordes sacked Ch’ang -an, and
slaughtered the population indiscriminately.* Thirty-six million people
are said to have lost their lives in the rebellion. 30 In the end it
failed; An Lu-shan was killed by his son, who was killed by a general,
who was</p>
<p>killed by his son. By the year 762 a.d. the turmoil had worn itself
out, and Ming Huang returned, heart-broken, to his ruined capital.
There, a few months later, he died. In this framework of romance and
tragedy the poetry of China flourished as never before.</p>

<p>One day, at the height of his reign, Ming Huang received ambassadors
from Korea, who brought him important messages written in a dialect
which none of his ministers could understand. “What!” exclaimed t he
Emperor, “among so many magistrates, so many scholars and warriors,
cannot there be found a single one who knows enough to relieve us of
vexation in this affair? If in three days no one is able to decipher
this letter, every one of your appointments shall be suspended.”</p>
<p>For a day the ministers consulted and fretted, fearing for their
offices and their heads. Then Minister Ho Chi-chang approached the
throne and said: “Your subject presumes to announce to your Majesty that
there is a poet of great merit, called Li, at his house, who is
profoundly acquainted with more than one science; command him to read
this letter, for there is nothing of which he is not capable.” The
Emperor ordered Li to present himself at court immediately. But Li
refused to come, saying that he could not possibly be worthy of the task
assigned him, since his essay had been rejected by the mandarins at the
last examination for public office. The Emperor soothed him by
conferring upon him the title and robes of doctor of the first rank. Li
came, found his examiners among the ministers, forced them to take off
his boots, and then translated the document, which announced that Korea
proposed to make war for the recovery of its free- dom. Having read the
message, Li dictated a learned and terrifying reply, which the Emperor
signed without hesitation, almost believing what Ho whispered to him —
that Li was an angel banished from heaven for some impish deviltry.* 0 *
The Koreans sent apologies and tribute, and the Em- peror sent part of
the tribute to Li. Li gave it to the innkeeper, for he loved wine.</p>
<p>On the night of the poet’s birth his mother— of the family of Li —
had dreamed of Tai-po Hsing, the Great White Star, which in the West is
called Venus. So the child was named Li, meaning plum, and sur-</p>
<p>named Tai-po, which is to say, The White Star. At ten he had mas-</p>

poetry.</p>

<p>At twelve he went to live like a philosopher in the mountains, and
stayed there for many years. He grew in health and strength, practised
swords- manship, and then announced his abilities to the world: “Though
less than seven (Chinese) feet in height, I am strong enough to meet ten
thousand men.” 41 (“Ten thousand” is Chinese for many.) Then he wandered
leis - urely about the earth, drinking the lore of love from varied
lips. He sang a song to the “Maid of Wu”:</p>
<p>Wine of the grapes,</p>
<p>Goblets of gold —</p>
<p>And a pretty maid of Wu —</p>
<p>She comes on pony-back; she is fifteen.</p>
<p>Blue-painted eyebrows —</p>
<p>Shoes of pink brocade-</p>
<p>inarticulate speech —</p>
<p>But she sings bewitchingly well.</p>
<p>So, feasting at the table,</p>
<p>Inlaid with tortoise-shell,</p>
<p>She gets drunk in my lap.</p>
<p>Ah, child, what caresses</p>
<p>Behind lily-broidered curtains! 43</p>
<p>He married, but earned so little money that his wife left him, taking
the children with her. Was it to her, or to some less-wonted flame, that
he wrote his wistful lines? —</p>
<p>Fair one, when you were here, I filled the house with flowers.</p>
<p>Fair one, now you are gone — only an empty couch is left.</p>
<p>On the couch the embroidered quilt is rolled up; I cannot sleep.</p>
<p>It is three years since you went. The perfume you left behind</p>
<p>haunts me still.</p>
<p>The perfume strays about me forever; but where are you, Beloved?</p>
<p>I sigh — the yellow leaves fall from the branch;</p>
<p>I weep — the dew twinkles white on the green mosses. 48</p>
<p>He consoled himself with wine, and became one of the “Six Idlers of
the Bamboo Grove,” who took life without haste, and let their songs and
poems earn their uncertain bread. Hearing the wine of Niauchung highly
commended, Li set out at once for that city, three hundred miles away.

<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE AGE OF THE POETS 707</p>
<p>In his wanderings he met Tu Fu, who was to be his rival for
China’s</p>
<p>poetic crown; they exchanged lyrics, went hand in hand like brothers,
and slept under the same coverlet until fame divided them. Everybody
loved them, for they were as harmless as saints, and spoke with the same
pride and friendliness to paupers and kings. Finally they entered Ch’ang
-an; and the jolly minister Ho loved Li’s poetry so well that he sold
gold orna - ments to buy him drinks. Tu Fu describes him:</p>
<p>As for Li Po, give him a jugful,</p>
<p>He will write one hundred poems.</p>
<p>He dozes in a wine-shop</p>
<p>On a city-street of Chang-an;</p>
<p>And though his Sovereign calls,</p>
<p>He will not board the Imperial barge.</p>
<p>“Please, your Majesty,” says he,</p>
<p>“I am a god of wine.”</p>
<p>Those were merry days when the Emperor befriended him, and show- ered
him with gifts for singing the praises of the Pure One, Yang Kwei- fei.
Once Ming held a royal Feast of the Peonies in the Pavilion of Aloes,
and sent for Li Po to come and make verses in honor of his mistress. Li
came, but too drunk for poetry; court attendants threw cold water upon
his amiable face, and soon the poet burst into song, celebrating the
rivalry of the peonies with Lady Yang:</p>
<p>The glory of trailing clouds is in her garments,</p>
<p>And the radiance of a flower on her face.</p>
<p>O heavenly apparition, found only far above</p>
<p>On the top of the Mountain of Many Jewels,</p>
<p>Or in the fairy Palace of Crystal when the moon is up!</p>
<p>Yet I see her here in the earth’s garden—</p>
<p>The spring wind softly sweeps the balustrade,</p>
<p>And the dew-drops glisten thickly….</p>
<p>Vanquished are the endless longings of love</p>
<p>Borne into the heart on the winds of spring. 45</p>
<p>Who would not have been pleased to be the object of such song? And
yet the Lady Yang was persuaded that the poet had subtly satirized her;
and from that moment she bred suspicion of him in the heart of the
King.</p>

<p>He presented Li Po with a purse, and let him go. Once again the poet
took to the open road, and consoled himself with wine. He joined those
“Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup” whose drinkings were the talk of</p>
<p>Ch’ang -an. He accepted the view of Liu Ling, who desired always to
be followed by two servants, one with wine, the other with a spade to
bury him where he fell; for, said Liu, “the affairs of this world are no
more than duckweed in the river.”“ The poets of China were resolved to
atone for the Puritanism of Chinese philosophy. “To wash and rinse our
souls of their age- old sorrows,” said Li Po, “we drained a hundred jugs
of</p>
<p>wine.”“ And he intones like Omar the gospel of the grape:</p>
<p>The swift stream pours into the sea and returns never more.</p>
<p>Do you not see high on yonder tower</p>
<p>A white-haired one sorrowing before his bright mirror?</p>
<p>In the morning those locks were like black silk.</p>
<p>In the evening they are all like snow.</p>
<p>Let us, while we may, taste the old delights,</p>
<p>And leave not the golden cask of wine</p>
<p>To stand alone in the moonlight….</p>
<p>I desire only the long ecstasy of wine,</p>
<p>And desire not to awaken….</p>
<p>Now let you and me buy wine today!</p>
<p>Why say we have not the price?</p>
<p>My horse spotted with fine flowers,</p>
<p>My fur coat worth a thousand pieces of gold.</p>
<p>These I will take out, and call my boy</p>
<p>To barter them for sweet wine,</p>
<p>And with you twain, let me forget</p>
<p>The sorrow of ten thousand ages!“</p>
<p>What were these sorrows? The agony of despised love? Hardly; for</p>
<p>hough the Chinese take love as much to heart as we do, their poets do
not so frequently intone its pains. It was war and exile, An Lu-shan
and</p>
<p>he taking of the capital, the flight of the Emperor and the death
of</p>
<p>Yang, the return of Ming Huang to his desolated halls, that gave Li
the taste of human tragedy. “There is no end to war!” he mourns; and
then his heart goes out to the women who have lost their husbands to
Mars.</p>

<p>Remembering him who snatched his sword and went to save the</p>
<p>border-land,</p>
<p>Him who suffered bitterly in the cold beyond the Great Wall,</p>
<p>Him who fell in the battle, and will never come back.</p>
<p>In the tiger-striped gold case for her keeping</p>
<p>There remains a pair of white-feathered arrows</p>
<p>Amid the cobwebs and dust gathered of long years —</p>

much as Tsui Tsung-chi des cribed him: “A knapsack on your back filled
with books, you go a thousand miles and more, a pilgrim. Under your
sleeves there is a dagger, and in your pocket a collection of poems.” 50
In these long wanderings his old friendship with nature gave him solace
and an unnamable peace; and through his lines we see his land of
flowers, and feel that urban civilization already lay heavy on the
Chinese soul:</p>
<p>Why do I live among the green mountains?</p>
<p>1 laugh and answer not, my soul is serene;</p>
<p>It dwells in another heaven and earth belonging to no man.</p>
<p>The peach trees are in flower, and the water flows on. 61</p>
<p>Or again:</p>
<p>I saw the moonlight before my couch,</p>
<p>And wondered if it were not the frost on the ground.</p>

<p>I bowed my head and thought of my far-off home. 52</p>

<p>Now, as his hair grew white, his heart was flooded with longing
for</p>
<p>he scenes of his youth. How many times, in the artificial life of
the</p>

home!</p>
<p>In the land of Wu the mulberry leaves are green,</p>
<p>And thrice the silkworms have gone to sleep.</p>
<p>In East Luh, where my family stays,</p>
<p>I wonder who is sowing those fields of ours.</p>
<p>I cannot be back in time for the spring doings,</p>
<p>Yet I can help nothing, traveling on the river.</p>
<p>The south wind, blowing, wafts my homesick spirit</p>
<p>And carries it up to the front of our familiar tavern.</p>
<p>There I see a peach-tree on the east side of the house,</p>
<p>With thick leaves and branches waving in the blue mist.</p>
<p>It is the tree I planted before my parting three years ago.</p>
<p>The peach-tree has grown now as tall as the tavern-roof,</p>
<p>While I have wandered about without returning.</p>
<p>Ping-yang, my pretty daughter, I see you stand</p>
<p>By the peach-tree, and pluck a flowering branch.</p>
<p>You pluck the flowers, but I am not there —</p>
<p>How your tears flow like a stream of water!</p>
<p>My little son, Po- chin, grown up to your sister’s shoulders,</p>
<p>You come out with her under the peach-tree;</p>
<p>But who is there to pat you on the back?</p>
<p>When I think of these things my senses fail,</p>

<p>And send it to you with my love a long way up the river. 58</p>
<p>His last years were bitter, for he had never stooped to make money,
and in the chaos of war and revolution he found no king to keep him from
starvation. Gladly he accepted the offer of Li-ling, Prince of Yung, to
join his staff; but Li-ling revolted against the successor of Ming
Huang, and when the revolt was suppressed, Li Po found himself in jail,
con- demned to death as a traitor to the state. Then Kuo Tsi-i, the
general who had put down the rebellion of An Lu-shan, begged that Li
Po’s</p>

<p>after a general amnesty was declared, and the poet turned his
faltering steps homeward. Three years later he sickened and died; and
legend, dis- content with an ordinary end for so rare a soul, told how
he was drowned in a river while attempting, in hilarious intoxication,
to embrace the water’s reflection of the moon.</p>
<p>All in all, the thirty volumes of delicate and kindly verse which he
left behind him warrant his reputation as the greatest poet of China.

<p>V. SOME QUALITIES OF CHINESE POETRY</p>
<p>“ Free verse ” — “ Imagism ” — “ Every poem a picture and every</p>
<p>picture a poem ” — Sentimentality — Perfection of form</p>
<p>It is impossible to judge Chinese poetry from Li alone; to feel it
(which is better than judging) one must surrender himself unhurriedly to
many Chinese poets, and to the unique methods of their poetry. Certain
subtle qualities of it are hidden from us in translation: we do not see
the pic- turesque written characters, each a monosyllable, and yet
expressing a</p>
<p>A precious wood.</p>
<p>Cf. p. 694 above.</p>
<p>712</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>complex idea; we do not see the lines, running from top to bottom and
from right to left; we do not catch the meter and the rhyme, which
adhere with proud rigidity to ancient precedents and laws; we do not
hear the tones — the flats and sharps — that give a beat to Chinese
verse; at least half the art of the Far Eastern poet is lost when he is
read by what we should call a “foreigner.” In the original a Chinese
poem at its best is a form as polished and precious as a hawthorn vase;
to us it is only a bit of decep- tively “free” or “imagist” verse, half
caught and weakly rendered by some earnest but alien mind.</p>
<p>What we do see is, above all, brevity. We are apt to think these</p>
<p>poems too slight, and feel an unreal disappointment at missing the
majesty and boredom of Milton and Homer. But the Chinese believe that
all poetry must be brief; that a long poem is a contradiction in terms —
since poetry, to them, is a moment’s ecstasy, and dies when dragged out
in epic reams. Its mission is to see and paint a picture with a stroke,
and write a philosophy in a dozen lines; its ideal is infinite meaning
in a little rhythm. Since pictures are of the essence of poetry, and the
essence of Chinese writing is pictography, the written language of China
is spontaneously poetic; it lends itself to writing in pictures, and
shuns abstractions that cannot be phrased as things seen. Since
abstractions multiply with civili- zation, the Chinese language, in its
written form, has become a secret code of subtle suggestions; and in
like manner, and perhaps for a like reason, Chinese poetry combines
suggestion with concentration, and aims to re- veal, through the picture
it draws, some deeper thing invisible. It does not discuss, it
intimates; it leaves out more than it says; and only an Oriental can
fill it in. “The men of old,” say the Chinese, “reckoned it the highest
excellence in poetry that the meaning should be beyond the words, and
that the reader should have to think it out for himself.”” Like Chinese
manners and art, Chinese poetry is a matter of infinite grace concealed
in a placid simplicity. It foregoes metaphor, comparison and allusion,
but relies on showing the thing itself, with a hint of its implications.
It avoids exaggeration and passion, but appeals to the mature mind by
understate- ment and restraint; it is seldom romantically excited in
form, but knows how to express intense feeling in its own quietly
classic way.</p>

<p>We may tire, at times, of a certain sentimentality in these poems,
a</p>
<p>vainly wistful mood of regret that time will not stop in its flight
and let men and states be young forever. We perceive that the
civilization of China was already old and weary in the days of Ming
Huang, and that its poets, like the artists of the Orient in general,
were fond of repeating old themes, and of spending their artistry on
flawless form. But there is nothing quite like this poetry elsewhere,
nothing to match it in delicacy of expression, in tenderness and yet
moderation of feeling, in simplicity and brevity of phrase clothing the
most considered thought. We are told that the poetry written under the
T’ang emperors plays a large part in the training of every Chinese
youth, and that one cannot meet an intelli- gent Chinese who does not
know much of that poetry by heart. If this is so, then Li Po and Tu Fu

<p>Po Chii-i took the other road, choosing public office and life in
the</p>
<p>capital; he rose from place to place until he was governor of the
great city of Hangchow, and President of the Board of War. Nevertheless
he lived to the age of seventy-two, wrote four thousand poems, and
tasted Nature to his heart’s content in interludes of exile. 68 He knew
the secret of mingling solitude with crowds, and repose with an active
life. He made not too many friends, being, as he said, of middling
accomplishment in “calligraphy, painting, chess and gambling, which tend
to bring men to - gether in pleasurable intercourse.” 66 He liked to
talk wit h simple people, and story has it that he would read his poems
to an old peasant woman, and simplify anything that she could not
understand. Hence he became the best-loved of the Chinese poets among
the common people; his poetry was inscribed everywhere, on the walls of
schools and temples, and the cabins of ships. “You must not think,” said
a “sing - song” girl to a cap - tain whom she was entertaining, “that I
am an ordinary dancing girl; I can recite Master Po’s “Everlasting
Wrong.” 66 *</p>
<p>We have ke pt for the last the profound and lovable Tu Fu.
“English</p>
<p>writers on Chinese literature,” says Arthur Waley, “are fond of
announc - ing that Li T’ai - po is China’s greatest poet; the Chinese
themselves, how - ever, award this place to Tu Fu.” 61 We first h ear of
him at Chang-an; he had come up to take the examinations for office, and
had failed. He was not dismayed, even though his failure had been
specifically in the subject of poetry; he announced to the public that
his poems were a good cure for malarial fever, and seems to have tried
the cure himself. 66 Ming Huang read some of his verses, gave him,
personally, another examination,</p>

<p>marked him successful, and appointed him secretary to General Tsoa.
Emboldened, and forgetting for a moment his wife and children in their
distant village, Tu Fu settled down in the capital, exchanged songs with
Li Po, and studied the taverns, paying for his wine with poetry. He</p>
<p>writes of Li:</p>
<p>I love my Lord as younger brother loves elder brother,</p>
<p>In autumn, exhilarated by wine, we sleep under a single quilt;</p>
<p>Hand in hand, we daily walk together. 63</p>
<p>Those were the days of the love of Ming for Yang Kwei-fei. Tu</p>
<p>celebrated it like the other poets; but when revolution burst forth,
and rival ambitions drenched China in blood, he turned his muse to
sadder themes, and pictured the human side of war:</p>
<p>Last night a government order came</p>
<p>To enlist boys who had reached eighteen.</p>
<p>They must help defend the capital….</p>
<p>0 Mother! O Children , do not weep so!</p>
<p>Shedding such tears will injure you.</p>
<p>When tears stop flowing then bones come through,</p>
<p>Nor Heaven nor Earth has compassion then….</p>
<p>Do you know that in Shantung there are two hundred counties</p>
<p>urned to the desert forlorn,</p>
<p>Thousands of villages, farms, covered only with bushes, the
thorn?</p>
<p>Men are slain like dogs, women driven like hens along….</p>
<p>If I had only known how bad is the fate of boys</p>
<p>1 would have had my children all girls….</p>
<p>Boys are only born to be buried beneath tall grass.</p>
<p>Still the bones of the war-dead of long ago are beside the Blue
Sea</p>

<p>They are wildly white and they lie exposed on the sand,</p>
<p>Both the little young ghosts and the old ghosts gather here to
cry</p>
<p>in a band.</p>
<p>When the rains sweep down, and the autumn, and winds that chill,</p>
<p>Their voices are loud, so loud that I learn how grief can kill….</p>

<p>For two years, during the revolutionary interlude, he wandered about
China, sharing his destitution with his wife and children, so poor that
he begged for bread, and so humbled that he knelt to pray for blessings
upon the man who took his family in and fed them for a while. 65 He was
saved by the kindly general Yen Wu, who made him his secretary, put up
with his moods and pranks, established him in a cottage by Washing
Flower Stream, and required nothing more of him than that he should
write poetry.* He was happy now, and sang blissfully of rain and
flowers,</p>

<p>Of what use is a phrase or a fine stanza?</p>

<p>The good general liked him so that he disturbed his peace, raising
him to high office as a Censor in Ch’ang -an. Then suddenly the general
died, war raged around the poet, and, left only with his genius, he soon
found himself penniless again. His children, savage with hunger, sneered
at him for his helplessness. He passed into a bitter and lonely old age,
“an ugly thing now to the eye”; the roof of his cabin was torn away by
the wind,</p>

<p>and urchins robbed him of the straw of his bed while he looked on,
too physically weak to resist. 87 Worst of all, he lost his taste for
wine, and could no longer solve the problems of life in the fashion of
Li Po. At</p>
<p>last he turned to religion, and sought solace in Buddhism.
Prematurely senile at fifty-nine, he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Huen
Mountain to visit a famous temple. There he was discovered by a
magistrate who had read his poetry. The official took the poet home, and
ordered a banquet to be served in his honor; hot beef smoked, and sweet
wine abounded; Tu Fu had not for many years seen such a feast. He ate
hungrily. Then at his host’s request, he tried to compose and sing; but
he fell down</p>
<p>exhausted. The next day he died. 68</p>

<p>The abundance of Chinese literature — Romances — History —</p>
<p>Szuma Ch’ien— Essays — Han Yu on the bone of Buddha</p>
<p>The Tang poets are but a part of Chinese poetry, and poetry is a
small part of China’s literature. It is hard for us to realize the age
and abund - ance of this literature, or its wide circulation among the
people. Lack of copyright laws helped other factors to make printing
cheap; and it was nothing unusual, before the advent of western ideas,
to find bound sets of twenty volumes selling new at one dollar,
encyclopedias in twenty volumes selling new at four dollars, and all the
Chinese Classics together obtainable for two. 60 It is harder still for
us to appreciate this literature, for the Chinese value form and style
far above contents in judging a book, and form and style are betrayed by
every translation. The Chinese pardonably consider their literature
superior to any other than that of Greece; and perhaps the exception is
due to Oriental courtesy.</p>
<p>Fiction, through which Occidental authors most readly rise to fame,
is not ranked as literature by the Chinese. It hardly existed in China
before the Mongols brought it in ; 70 and even today the best of Chinese
novels are classed by the literati as popular amusements unworthy of
mention in a his- tory of Chinese letters. The simple folk of the cities
do not mind these distinctions, but turn without prejudice from the
songs of Po Chii-i and Li Po to the anonymous interminable romances
that, like the theatre, use the col- loquial dialects of the people, and
bring back to them vividly the dramatic events of their historic past.
For almost all the famous novels of China take the form of historical
fiction; few of them aim at realism, and fewer still attempt such
psychological or social analysis as lift The Brothers Karamazov</p>
<p>718 the story of civilization (chap.xxiv</p>
<p>and The Magic Mountain, War and Peace and Les Miser ables, to the
level of great literature. One pf the earliest Chinese novels is the
Shui Hu Chuan, or “Tale of the Water Margins,” compose d by a bevy of
authors in the fourteenth century;* one of the vastest is the Hung Lou
Men (ca. 1650), a twenty-four- volume “Dream of the Red Chamber”; one of
the best is the Liao Chai Chih 1 (ca. 1660), or “Strange Stories,” much
honored for the beauty and terseness of its style; the most famous is
the San Kuo Chih Yen 1 , or “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” a twelve
-hundred-page embellish- ment, by Lo Kuan-chung (1260-1341), of the wars
and intrigues that fol- lowed the fall of the Han.t These expansive
stories correspond to the picaresque novels of eighteenth-century
Europe; often (if one may report mere hearsay in these matters) they
combine the jolly portrayal of character of Tom Jones with the lively
narrative of Gil Bias. They are recommended to the reader’s leisurely
old age.</p>
<p>The most respectable form of literature in China is history; and of
all the accepted forms it is also the most popular. No other nation has
had so many historians, certainly no other nation has written such
extensive histories. Even the early courts had their official scribes,
who chronicled the achieve- ments of their sovereigns and the portents
of the time; and this office of court historian, carried down to our own
generation, has raised up in China a mass of historical literature
unequaled in length or dullness anywhere else on the earth. The twenty-
four official “Dynastic Histories” published in 1747 ran to 219 large
volumes. 71 From the Shu- Ching, or “Book of History,” so edifyingly
bowdlerized by Confucius, and the Tso-chuan, a commentary written a
century later to illustrate and vivify the book of the Master, and the
Annals of the Bamboo Books, found in the tomb of a king of Wei, his-
toriography advanced rapidly in China until, in the second century
before Christ, it produced a chef- d’oeuvre in the Historical Record
painstakingly put together by Szuma Ch’ien.</p>
<p>Succeeding to his father as court astrologer, Szuma first reformed
the calendar, and then devoted his life to a task which his father had
begun, of narrating the history of China from the first mythical dynasty
to his own day. He had no penchant for beauty of style, but aimed merely
to make his record complete. He divided his book into five parts: (1)
Annals of the Emperors; (2) Chronological Tables; (3) Eight chapters on
rites, music, the pitch-pipes, the calendar, astrology, imperial
sacrifices, water courses, and political economy; (4) Annals of the
Feudal Nobles; and (5) Biographies</p>

<p>of Eminent Men. The whole covered a period of nearly three thousand
years, and took the form of 526,000 Chinese characters patiently
scratched upon bamboo tablets with a style. 72 Then Szuma Ch’ien, having
given his life to his book, sent his volumes to his emperor and the
world with this modest preface:</p>
<p>Your servant’s physical strength is now relaxed; his eyes are
short-</p>
<p>sighted and dim; of his teeth but a few remain. His memory is so</p>
<p>impaired that the events of the moment are forgotten as he turns</p>
<p>away from them, his energies having been wholly exhausted in pro-
duction of this book. He therefore hopes that your Majesty may</p>
<p>pardon his vain attempt for the sake of his loyal intention, and
in</p>
<p>moments of leisure will deign to cast a sacred glance over this work,
so as to learn from the rise and fall of former dynasties the secret</p>
<p>of the successes and failures of the present hour. Then if such</p>
<p>knowledge shall be applied for the advantage of the Empire, even</p>
<p>hough your servant may lay his bones in the Yellow Springs, the</p>
<p>aim and ambition of his life will be fulfilled. 78</p>
<p>We shall find none of the brilliance of Taine in the pages of Szuma
Ch’ien, no charming gossip and anecdotes in the style of Herodotus, no
sober con- catenation of cause and effect as in Thucydides, no
continental vision pictured in music as in Gibbon; for history seldom
rises, in China, from an industry to an art. From Szuma Ch’ien to his
namesake Szuma Kuang, who, eleven hundred years later, attempted again a
universal history of China, the Chinese historians have labored to
record faithfully — sometimes at the cost of their income or their lives
— the events of a dynasty or a reign; they have spent their energies
upon truth, and have left nothing for beauty. Perhaps they were right,
and history should be a science rather than an art; perhaps the facts of
the past are obscured when they come to us in the purple of Gibbon or
the sermons of Carlyle. But we, too, have dull historians, and can match
any nation in volumes dedicated to record — and gather — dust.</p>
<p>Livelier is the Chinese essay; for here art is not forbidden, and
eloquence has loose rein. Famous beyond the rest in this field is the
great Han Yu, whose books are so valued that tradition requires the
reader to wash his hands in rose-water before touching them. Bom among
the humblest, Han Yu reached to the highest ranks in the service of the
state, and fell from grace only because he protested too intelligibly
against the imperial con- cessions to Buddhism. To Han the new religion
was merely a Hindu super- stition; and it offended him to his Confucian
soul that the Emperor should lend his sanction to the intoxication of
his people with this enervating dream.</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Therefore he submitted (803 a.d.) a memorial to the Emperor, from
which these lines may serve as an example of Chinese prose discolored
even by honest translation:</p>
<p>Your servant has now heard that instructions have been issued to</p>
<p>he priestly community to proceed to Feng-hsiang and receive a</p>
<p>bone of Buddha, and that from a high tower your Majesty will</p>
<p>view its introduction into the Imperial Palace; also that orders
have</p>
<p>been sent to the various temples, commanding that the relic be
re-</p>
<p>ceived with the proper ceremonies. Now, foolish though your</p>
<p>servant may be, he is well aware that your Majesty does not do</p>
<p>his in the vain hope of deriving advantages therefrom; but that
in</p>
<p>he fulness of our present plenty, and in the joy which reigns in
the</p>
<p>heart of all, there is a desire to fall in with the wishes of the
people</p>
<p>in the celebration at the capital of this delusive mummery. For</p>
<p>how could the wisdom of your Majesty stoop to participate in</p>
<p>such ridiculous beliefs? Still the people are slow of perception
and</p>
<p>easily beguiled; and should they behold your Majesty thus earnestly
worshiping a t the feet of Buddha, they would cry out, “See! the</p>
<p>Son of Heaven, the All-Wise, is a fervent believer; who are we,
his</p>
<p>people, that we should spare our bodies?” Then would ensue a</p>
<p>scorching of heads and burning of fingers; crowds would collect</p>
<p>ogether, and tearing off their clothes and scattering their
money,</p>
<p>would spend their time from morn to eve in imitation of your</p>
<p>Majesty’s example. The result would be that by and by young and</p>
<p>old, seized with the same enthusiasm, would totally neglect the busi-
ness of their lives; and should your Majesty not prohibit it, they</p>
<p>would be found flocking to the temples, ready to cut off an arm</p>
<p>or slice their bodies as an offering to the god. Thus would our</p>
<p>raditions and customs be seriously injured, and ourselves become a
laughing-stock on the face of the earth….</p>
<p>Therefore your servant, overwhelmed with shame for the Cen-</p>
<p>sors,* implores your Majesty that these bones be handed over for</p>
<p>destruction by fire and water, whereby the root of this great
evil</p>
<p>may be exterminated for all time, and the people know how much</p>
<p>he wisdom of your Majesty surpasses that of ordinary men. The</p>
<p>glory of such a deed will be beyond all praise. And should the</p>
<p>Lord Buddha have power to avenge this insult by the infliction of</p>
<p>some misfortune, then let the vials of his wrath be poured out

<p>In a conflict between superstition and philosophy one may safely
wager on the victory of superstition, for the world wisely prefers
happiness to wisdom. Han was exiled to a village in Kuang-tung, where
the people were still simple barbarians. He did not complain, but set
himself, after the teach- ing of Confucius, to civilize them with his
example; and he succeeded so well that his picture today often bears the
legend: “Wherever he passed, he purified.” 75 He was finally recalled to
the capital, served his state well, and died loaded with honors. His
memorial tablet was placed in the Temple of Confucius — a place usually
reserved for the disciples or greatest ex- ponents of the Master —
because he had defended the doctrines of Confucian- ism so recklessly
against the invasion of a once noble but now corrupted faith.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE STAGE</li>
</ol>
<p>Its low repute in China — Origins — The play — The audience —</p>
<p>The actors — Music</p>
<p>It is difficult to classify Chinese drama, for it is not recognized
by China as either literature or art. Like many other elements of human
life, its repute is not proportioned to its popularity. The names of the
dramatists are seldom heard; and the actors, though they may give a
lifetime to preparation and accomplishment, and rise to a hectic fame,
are looked upon as members of an inferior order. Something of this odor,
no doubt, attached to actors in every civilization, above all in those
medieval days when drama was rebelliously differentiating itself from
the religious pan- tomimes that had given it birth.</p>
<p>A similar origin is assigned to the Chinese theatre. Under the
Chou</p>
<p>Dynasty religious ritual included certain dances performed with
wands. Tradition says that these dances were later forbidden, on the
score that they had become licentious; and it was apparently from this
cleavage that secular drama began. 76 Ming Huang, patron of so many
arts, helped the development of an independent drama by gathering about
him a company of male and female actors whom he called “The Young Folk
of the Pear Garden”; but it was not till the reign of Kublai Khan that
the Chinese theatre took on the scope of a national institution. In the
year 1031 K’ung Tao -fu, a descendant of Confucius, was sent as Chinese
envoy</p>
<p>722 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>o the Mongol Kitans, and was welcomed with a celebration that
included a play. The buffoon, however, represented Confucius. K’ung Tao
-fu</p>
<p>walked out in a huff, but when he and other Chinese travelers among
the Mongols returned to China they brought reports of a form of drama
more advanced than any that China had yet known. When the Mongols
conquered China they introduced to it both the novel and the theatre;
and the classic examples of Chinese drama are still the plays that were
written under the Mongol sway.”</p>
<p>The art developed slowly, for neither the church nor the state would
support it. For the most part it was practised by strolling players, who
set up a platform in some vacant field and performed before a village
audience standing under the open sky. Occasionally mandarins engaged
actors to perform at private dinner-parties, and sometimes a guild would
produce a play. Theatres became more numerous during the nineteenth
century, but even at its close there were only two in the large city of
Nanking.” The drama was a mixture of history, poetry and music; usually
some episode from an historical romance was the center of the plot; or
scenes might be played from different dramas on the same evening. There
was no limit to the length of the performance; it might be brief, or
last several days; ordinarily it took six or seven hours, as with the
best of con- temporary American plays. There was much swashbuckling and
oratory, much violence of blood and speech; but the denouement did its
best to atone for reality by making virtue triumph in the end. The drama
be- came an educational and ethical instrument, teaching the people
some- thing about their history, and inculcating the Confucian virtues —
above all, filial piety — with a demoralizing regularity.</p>
<p>The stage had little furnishing or scenery, and no exits; all the
actors in the cast, along with their supernumeraries, sat on the stage
throughout the play, rising when their roles demanded; occasionally
attendants served them tea. Other functionaries passed about among the
audience selling to- bacco, tea and refreshments, and providing hot
towels for the wiping of faces during summer evenings; drinking, eating
and conversation were now and then interrupted by some exceptionally
fine or loud acting on the stage. The actors had often to shout in order
to be heard; and they wore masks in order that their roles might be
readily understood. As the result of Ch’ien Lung’s prohibition of woman
players, female parts were acted by men, and so well that when women
were in our time again ad- mitted to the stage, they had to imitate
their imitators in order to sue-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE AGE OF THE POETS 723</p>
<p>ceed. The actors were required to be experts in acrobatics and the
dance, for their parts often called for skilful manipulation of the
limbs, and al- most every action had to be performed according to some
ritual of grace in harmony with the music that accompanied the stage.
Gestures were symbolic, and had to be precise and true to old
conventions; in such accomplished actors as Mei Lan-fang the artistry of
hands and body con- stituted half the poetry of the play. It was not
completely theatre, not quite opera, not predominantly dance; it was a
mixture almost medieval in quality, but as perfect in its kind as
Palestrina’s music, or stained</p>
<p>glass.”</p>
<p>Music was seldom an independent art, but belonged as a handmaiden to
religion and the stage. Tradition ascribed its origin, like so much
else, to the legendary emperor Fu Hsi. The Li- Chi, or “Book of Rites,”
dating from before Confucius, contained or recorded several treatises on
music; and the Tso-chuan, a century after Confucius, described
eloquently the music to which the odes of Wei were sung. Already, by
Kung-fu- tze’s time, musical standards were ancient, and innovations
were disturbing quiet souls; the sage complained of the lascivious airs
that were in his day supplanting the supposedly moral tunes of the past.
80 Greco-Bactrian and Mongolian influences entered, and left their mark
upon the simple Chin- ese scale. The Chinese knew of the division of the
octave into twelve semi-tones, but they preferred to write their music
in a pentatonic scale, corresponding roughly to our F, G, A, C, and D;
to these whole tones they gave the names “Emperor,” “Prime Minister,”
“Subject People,” “State</p>
