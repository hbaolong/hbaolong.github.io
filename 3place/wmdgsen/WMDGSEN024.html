<p>The Age of the Philosophers</p>
<p>I. THE BEGINNINGS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Estimates of the Chinese</li>
</ol>
<p>T ’HE intellectual discovery of China was one of the achievements of
the Enlightenment. “These peoples,” Dider ot wrote of the Chinese,</p>
<p>“are superior to all other Asiatics in antiquity, art, intellect,
wisdom, pol - icy, and in their taste for philosophy; nay, in the
judgment of certain authors, they dispute the palm in these matters with
the most enlightened pe oples of Europe.” 1 * “The body of this empire,”
said Voltaire, “has ex - isted four thousand years, without having
undergone any sensible altera- tion in its laws, customs, language, or
even in its fashions of apparel. . . . The organization of this empire
is in truth the best that the world has ever seen.”* This respect of
scholars has survived closer acquaintance, and in some contemporary
observers it has reached the pitch of humble admira- tion. Count
Keyserling, in one of the most instructive and imaginative books of our
time, concludes that</p>
<p>altogether the most perfect type of humanity as a normal phenom-</p>
<p>enon has been elaborated in ancient China . . . China has created the
highest universal culture of being hitherto known . . . The greatness of
China takes hold of and impresses me more and more . . . The</p>
<p>great men of this country stand on a higher level of culture than</p>
<p>ours do; . . . these gentlemen* . . . stand on an extraordinarily
high</p>
<p>level as types; especially their superiority impresses me. . . .
How</p>
<p>perfect the courtesy of the cultured Chinaman! . . . China’s suprem -
acy of form is unquestionable in all circumstances. . . . The China-</p>
<p>man is perhaps the profoundest of all men.*</p>
<p>The Chinese do not trouble to deny this; and until the present
century (there are now occasional exceptions) they were unanimous in
regarding the inhabitants of Europe and America as barbarians.* It was
the gentle</p>
<ul>
<li>The deposed Mandarins at Tsing-tao.</li>
</ul>
<p>640 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>custom of the Chinese, in official documents before i860, to employ
the character for “barbarian” in rendering the term “foreigner”; and the
bar - barians had to stipulate by treaty that this translation should be
improved. 6 * Like most other peopl es of the earth, “the Chinese
consider themselves the most polished and civilized of all nations.” 7
Perhaps they are right, despite their political corruption and chaos,
their backward science and sweated industry, their odorous cities and
offal-strewn fields, their floods and famines, their apathy and cruelty,
their poverty and superstition, their reckless breeding and suicidal
wars, their slaughters and ignominious de- feats. For behind this dark
surface that now appears to the alien eye is one of the oldest and
richest of living civilizations: a tradition of poetry reaching as far
back as 1700 b.c.; a long record of philosophy idealistic and yet
practical, profound and yet intelligible; a mastery of ceramics and
painting unequaled in their kind; an easy perfection, rivaled only by
the Japanese, in all the minor arts; the most effective morality to be
found among the peoples of any time; a social organization that has held
together more human beings, and has endured through more centuries, than
any other known to history; a form of government which, until the
Revolu- tion destroyed it, was almost the ideal of philosophers; a
society that was civilized when Greece was inhabited by barbarians, that
saw the rise and fall of Babylonia and Assyria, Persia and Judea, Athens
and Rome, Venice and Spain, and may yet survive when those Balkans
called Europe have reverted to darkness and savagery. What is the secret
of this durability of government, this artistry of hand, this poise and
depth of soul?</p>

<li>The Middle Flowery Kingdom</li>

<p>Geography — Race — Prehistory</p>
<p>If we consider Russia as Asiatic — which it was till Peter, and may
be again — then Europe becomes only a jagged promontory of Asia, the in-
dustrial projection of an agricultural hinterland, the tentative fingers
or pseudopodia of a giant continent. Dominating that continent is China,
as spacious as Europe, and as populous. Hemmed in, through most of its

extracts in Gems of Chinese Literature , sent him, as a well-meant

<p>From of old, literature has illumined the nation of nations;</p>
<p>And now its influence has gone forth to regenerate a barbarian
official. 8</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 641</p>
<p>tory, by the largest ocean, the highest mountains, and one of the
most extensive deserts in the world, China enjoyed an isolation that
gave her comparative security and permanence, immutability and
stagnation. Hence the Chinese called their country not China but
Tien-hua — “Under the Heavens”— or Sz-hai — “Within the Four Seas”— or
Chung-kuo — “Middle Kingdom”— or Chung-hwa-kuo — 1 “Middle Flowery
Kingdom”— or, by de- cree of the Revolution, Chun-hwa-min-kuo — “Middle
Flowery People’s Kingdom.” 8 Flowers it has in abundance, and all the
varied natural scenery that can come from sunshine and floating mists,
perilous mountain crags, majestic rivers, deep gorges, and swift
waterfalls amid rugged hills.</p>
<p>Through the fertile south runs the Yang-tze River, three thousand
miles in length; farther north the Hoang-ho, or Yellow River, descends
from the western ranges amid plains of loess to carry its silt through
vacillating estuaries once to the Yellow Sea, now to the Gulf of
Pechili, tomorrow, possibly, to the Yellow Sea again. Along these and
the Wei and other broad streams* Chinese civilization began, driving
back the beast and the jungle, holding the surrounding barbarians at
bay, clearing the soil of brush and bramble, ridding it of destructive
insects and corrosive deposits like saltpetre, draining the marshes,
fighting droughts and floods and devastating changes in the courses of
the rivers, drawing the water</p>
<p>patiently and wearily from these friendly enemies into a thousand
canals, and building day by day through centuries — huts and houses,
temples and schools, villages, cities and states. How long men have
toiled to build the civilizations that men so readily destroy!</p>
<p>No one knows whence the Chinese came, or what was their race, or how
old their civilization is. The remains of the “Peking Man”t suggest the
great antiquity of the human ape in China; and the researches of Andrews
have led him to conclude that Mongolia was thickly populated, as far
back as 20,000 b.c., by a race whose tools corresponded to the “Azilian”
development of mesolithic Europe, and whose descendants spread into
Siberia and China as southern Mongolia dried up and became the Gobi
Desert. The discoveries of Andersson and others in Honan and south
Manchuria indicate a neolithic culture one or two thousand years later
than similar stages in the prehistory of Egypt and Sumeria. Some of the
stone tools found in these neolothic deposits resemble exactly, in
shape</p>

<p>and perforations, the iron knives now used in northern China to reap
the sorghum crop; and this circumstance, small though it is, reveals the
prob- ability that Chinese culture has an impressive continuity of seven
thousand years.“</p>
<p>We must not, through the blur of distance, exaggerate the homo-</p>
<p>geneity of this culture, or of the Chinese people. Some elements of
their early art and industry appear to have come from Mesopotamia and
Turkestan; for example, the neolithic pottery of Honan is almost
identical with that of Anau and Susa. n The present “Mongolian” type is
a highly complex mixture in which the primitive stock has been crossed
and re- crossed by a hundred invading or immigrating stocks from
Mongolia, southern Russia (the Scythians?), and central Asia.“ China,
like India, is to be compared with Europe as a whole rather than with
any one nation of Europe; it is not the united home of one people, but a
medley of human varieties different in origin, distinct in language,
diverse in character and art, and often hostile to one another in
customs, morals and government.</p>

<li>The Unknown Centuries</li>
</ol>
<p>The Creation according to China — The coming of culture — Wine</p>
<p>and chopsticks — The virtuous emperors — A royal atheist</p>
<p>China has been called “the paradise of historians.” For centuries and
millenniums it has had official historiographers who recorded everything
that happened, and much besides. We cannot trust them further back than
77 6 b.c.; but if we lend them a ready ear they will explain in detail
the history of China from 3000 b.c., and the more pious among them, like
our own seers, will describe the creation of the world. P ’an Ku, the
first man (they tell us), after laboring on the task for eighteen
thousand years, hammered the universe into shape about 2,229,000 b.c. As
he worked his breath became the wind and the clouds, his voice became
the thunder, his veins the rivers, his flesh the earth, his hair the
grass and trees, his bones the metals, his sweat the rain; and the
insects that clung to his body became the human race.“ We have no
evidence to disprove this ingenious cosmology.</p>
<p>The earliest kings, says Chinese legend, reigned eighteen
thousand</p>
<p>years each, and struggled hard to turn P’an Ku’s lice into civilized
men. Before the arrival of these “Celestial Emperors,” we are told, “the
people were like beasts, clothing themselves in skins, feeding on raw
flesh, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 643</p>
<p>knowing their mothers but not their fathers”— a limitation which
Strindberg did not consider exclusively ancient or Chinese. Then came
the emperor Fu Hsi, in precisely 2852 b.c.; with the help of his
enlightened Queen he taught his people marriage, music, writing,
painting, fishing with nets, the domestication of animals, and the
feeding of silkworms for the secretion of silk. Dying, he appointed as
his successor Shen Nung, who introduced agri- culture, invented the
wooden plough, established markets and trade, and developed the science
of medicine from the curative values of plants. So legend, which loves
personalities more than ideas, attributes to a few in- dividuals the
laborious advances of many generations. Then a vigorous soldier-emperor,
Huang-ti, in a reign of a mere century, gave China the magnet and the
wheel, appointed official historians, built the first brick structures
in China, erected an observatory for the study of the stars, cor- rected
the calendar, and redistributed the land. Yao ruled through another
century, and so well that Confucius, writing of him eighteen hundred
years later in what must have seemed a hectically “modem” age, mourned
the degeneration of China. The old sage, who was not above the pious
fraud of adorning a tale to point a moral, informs us that the Chinese
people became virtuous by merely looking at Yao. As first aid to
reformers, Yao placed outside his palace door a drum by which they might
summon him to hear their grievances, and a tablet upon which they might
write their advice to the government. “Now,” says the famous Book of
History,</p>
<p>concerning the good Yao it is said that he ruled Chung-kud for
one</p>
<p>hundred years, the years of his life being one hundred, ten and
six.</p>
<p>He was kind and benevolent as Heaven, wise and discerning as the</p>
<p>gods. From afar his radiance was like a shining cloud, and approach-
ing near him he was as brilliant as the sun. Rich was he without</p>
<p>ostentation, and regal without luxuriousness. He wore a yellow
cap</p>
<p>and a dark tunic and rode in a red chariot drawn by white horses.</p>
<p>The eaves of his thatch were not trimmed, and the rafters were un-
planed, while the beams of his house had no ornamental ends. His</p>
<p>principal food was soup, indifferently compounded, nor was he</p>
<p>choice in selecting his grain. He drank his broth of lentils from
a</p>
<p>dish that was made of clay, using a wooden spoon. His person was</p>
<p>not adorned with jewels, and his clothes were without embroidery,</p>
<p>simple and without variety. He gave no attention to uncommon</p>
<p>things and strange happenings, nor did he value those things that</p>
<p>were rare and peculiar. He did not listen to songs of dalliance,
his</p>
<p>&lt;4 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>chariot of state was not emblazoned. … In summer he wore his</p>
<p>simple garb of cotton, and in winter he covered himself with
skins</p>
<p>of the deer. Yet was he the richest, the wisest, the
longest-lived</p>
<p>and most beloved of all that ever ruled Chung-kuo. 11</p>
<p>The last of these “Five Rulers” was Shun, the model of filially
devoted sons, the patient hero who fought the floods of the Hoang-ho,
improved the calendar, standardized weights and measures, and endeared
himself to scholastic posterity by reducing the size of the whip with
which Chinese children were educated. In his old age Shun (Chinese
tradition tells us) raised to a place beside himself on the throne the
ablest of his aides, the great engineer Yu, who had controlled the
floods of nine rivers by cutting t hrough nine mountains and forming
nine lakes; “but for Yu,” say the</p>
<p>We have no way of checking the accounts transmitted to us of the Hsia
Dynasty by the early Chinese historians. Astronomers claim to have
verified the solar eclipse mentioned by the records as occurring in the
year 2165 B.c., but competent critics have challenged these
calculations. 10 Bones found in Honan bear the names of rulers
traditionally ascribed to the second or Shang Dynasty; and some bronze
vessels of great antiquity are tentatively attributed to this period.
For the rest we must rely on stories whose truth may not be proportioned
to their charm. According to ancient tradition one of the Shang
emperors, Wu Yi, was an atheist; he defied the gods, and blasphemed the
Spirit of Heaven; he played chess with it, ordered a court- ier to make
its moves, and derided it when it lost; having dedicated to it a
leathern bag, he filled the bag with blood, and amused himself by making
it a target for his arrows. The historians, more virtuous than history,
assure us that Wu Yi was struck dead with lightning.</p>

<p>The Feudal Age in China — An able minister — The struggle be-</p>

<p>lyrics from the u Book of Odes”</p>
<p>The feudal states that now provided for almost a thousand years what-
ever political order China was to enjoy, were not the creation of the
con- querors; they had grown out of the agricultural communities of
primitive days through the absorption of the weaker by the stronger, or
the merger of groups under a common chief for the defense of their
fields against the encompassing barbarians. At one time there were over
seventeen hundred of these principalities, ordinarily consisting of a
walled town surrounded by cultivated land, with smaller walled suburbs
constituting a protective circum- ference . 18 Slowly these provinces
coalesced into fifty-five, covering what is now the district of Honan
with neighboring portions of Shan-si, Shen-si and Shantung. Of these
fifty- five the most important were Ts’i, which laid the bases of
Chinese government, and Chin (or Tsin), which conquered all the rest,
established a unified empire, and gave to China the name by which it is
known to nearly all the world but itself.</p>
<p>The organizing genius of Ts’i was Kuan Chung, adviser to the Duke</p>
<p>Huan. Kuan began his c areer in history by supporting Huan’s
brother</p>
<p>646 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXm</p>
<p>against him in their competition for the control of Ts’i, and almost
killed Huan in battle. Huan won, captured Kuan, and appointed him chief
min- ister of the state. Kuan made his master powerful by replacing
bronze with iron weapons and tools, and by establishing governmental
monopoly or control of iron and salt. He taxed money, fish and salt, “in
order to help the poor and reward wise and able men.’”* During his long
ministry Ts’i became a well-ordered state, with a stabilized currency,
an efficient admin- istration, and a flourishing culture. Confucius, who
praised politicians only by epitaph, said of Kuan: “Down to the present
day the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for Kuan Chung we
should now be wear- ing our hair disheveled, and the lappets of our
coats buttoning on the left side.”**</p>
<p>In the feudal courts was developed the characteristic courtesy of the
Chinese gentleman. Gradually a code of manners, ceremonies and honor was
established, which became so strict that it served as a substitute for
religion among the upper classes of society. The foundations of law were
laid, and a great struggle set in between the rule of custom as
developed among the people and the rule of law as formulated by the
state. Codes of law were issued by the duchies of Cheng and Chin (535,
512 b.c.), much to the horror of the peasantry, who predicted divine
punishment for such out- rages; and indeed the capital of Cheng was soon
afterward destroyed by fire. The codes were partial to the aristocracy,
who were exempted from the regulations on condition that they should
discipline themselves; gentlemen murderers were allowed to commit
suicide, and most of them did, in the fashion later so popular in
samurai Japan. The people protested that they, too, could discipline
themselves, and called for some Harmodius or Aristo- giton to liberate
them from this new tyranny of law. In the end the two hostile forces,
custom and law, arrived at a wholesome compromise: the reach of law was
narrowed to major or national issues, while the force of custom
continued in all minor matters; and since human affairs are mostly minor
matters, custom remained king.</p>
<p>As the organization of states proceeded, it found formulation in the
Chou-li, or Law of Chou, a volume traditionally but incredibly ascribed
to Chou-kung, uncle and prime minister of the second Duke of Chou. This
legislation, suspiciously infused with the spirit of Confucius and
Mencius, and therefore in all likelihood a product of the end rather
than of the be- ginning of the Chou Dynasty, set for two thousand years
the Chinese con- ception of government: an emperor ruling as the vicar
and “Son of Heaven,”</p>
<ul>
<li>This is Confucius* gloomy way of indicating that but for Kuan the
Chinese people would still be barbarians; for the barbarians habitually
buttoned their coats on the left</li>
</ul>
<p>side . 21</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 647</p>
<p>and holding power through the possession of virtue and piety; an
aristocracy, partly of birth and partly of training, administering the
offices of the state; a people dutifully tilling the soil, living in
patriarchal families, enjoying civil rights but having no voice in
public affairs; and a cabinet of six ministries controlling respectively
the life and activities of the emperor, the welfare and early marriage
of the people, the ceremonies and divinations of religion, the
preparation and prosecution of war, the administration of justice, and
the organization of public works . 23 It is an almost ideal code, more
probably sprung from the mind of some anonymous and irresponsible Plato
than from the practice of leaders sullied with actual power and dealing
with actual men.</p>
<p>Since much deviltry can find room even in perfect constitutions, the
polit- ical history of China during the Feudal Age was the usual mixture
of perse- vering rascality with periodic reforms. As wealth increased,
luxury and ex- travagance corrupted the aristocracy, while musicians and
assassins, courte- sans and philosophers mingled at the courts, and
later in the capital at Lo- yang. Hardly a decade passed without some
assault upon the new states by the hungry barbarians ever pressing upon
the frontiers . 23 War became a necessity of defense, and soon a method
of offense; it graduated from a game of the aristocracy to competitive
slaughter among the people; heads were cut off by tens of thousands.
Within a little more than two cen- turies, regicides disposed of
thirty-six kings . 24 Anarchy grew, and the sages despaired.</p>
<p>Over these ancient obstacles life made its plodding way. The peasant
sowed and reaped, occasionally for himself, usually for his feudal lord,
to whom both he and the land belonged; not until the end of the dynasty
did peasant proprietorship raise its head. The state — i.e., a loose
association of feudal barons faintly acknowledging one ducal sovereign —
conscripted labor for public works, and irrigated the fields with
extensive canals; officials in- structed the people in agriculture and
arboriculture, and supervised the silk industry in all its details.
Fishing and the mining of salt were in many provinces monopolized by the
government . 25 Domestic trade flourished in the towns, and begot a
small bourgeoisie possessed of almost modern com- forts: they wore
leather shoes, and dresses of homespun or silk; they rode in carts or
chariots, or traveled on the rivers by boat; they lived in well- built
houses, used tables and chairs, and ate their food from plates and
dishes of ornamented pottery ; 28 their standard of living was probably
higher than that of their contemporaries in Solon’s Greece, or Numa’s
Rome.</p>
<p>Amid conditions of disunity and apparent chaos the mental life of
China showed a vitality disturbing to the generalizations of historians.
For in this disorderly age were laid the bases of China’s language,
literature,</p>

con- formity by the tyranny of inescapable tradition and an imperial
govern- ment, served as the social framework for the most creative
period in the history of the Chinese mind. At every court, and in a
thousand towns and villages, poets sang, potters turned their wheels,
founders cast stately vessels, leisurely scribes formed into beauty the
characters of the written language, sophists taught to eager students
the tricks of the intellect, and philosophers pined over the
imperfections of men and the decadence of states.</p>
<p>We shall study the art and language later, in their more complete and
characteristic development; but the poetry and the philosophy belong
specifically to this age, and constitute the classic period of Chinese
thought. Most of the verse written before Confucius has disappeared;
what remains of it is chiefly his own stem selection of the more
respectable samples, gathered together in the Shi- Ching, or “Book of
Odes,” ranging over a thousand years from ancient compositions of the
Shang Dynasty to highly modem poems as recent as Pythagoras. Its three
hundred and five odes celebrate with untranslatable brevity and
suggestive imagery the piety of religion, the hardships of war, and the
solicitude of love. Hear the timeless lament of soldiers tom from their
homes and dedicated to un- intelligible death:</p>
<p>How free are the wild geese on their wings,</p>
<p>And the rest they find on the bushy Yu trees!</p>
<p>But we, ceaseless toilers in the king’s services.</p>
<p>Cannot even plant our millet and rice.</p>
<p>What will our parents have to rely on?</p>
<p>O thou distant and azure Heaven!</p>
<p>When shall all this end? . . .</p>
<p>What leaves have not turned purple?</p>
<p>What man is not tom from his wife?</p>
<p>Mercy be on us soldiers: —</p>
<p>Are we not also men?”</p>
<p>Though this age appears, to our ignorance, to have been almost the
barbaric infancy of China, love poetry abounds in the Odes, and plays a
gamut of many moods. In one of these poems, whispering to us across</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 649</p>
<p>those buried centuries that seemed so model to Confucius, we hear the
voice of eternally rebellious youth, as if to say that nothing is so
old- fashioned as revolt:</p>
<p>I pray you, dear,</p>
<p>My little hamlet leave,</p>
<p>Nor break my willow-boughs;</p>
<p>’Tis not that I should grieve,</p>
<p>But I fear my sire to rouse.</p>
<p>Love pleads with passion disarrayed, —</p>
<p>“A sire’s commands must be obeyed.”</p>
<p>I pray you, dear,</p>
<p>Leap not across my wall,</p>
<p>Nor break my mulberry-boughs;</p>
<p>Not that I fear their fall,</p>
<p>But lest my brother’s wrath should rouse,</p>
<p>Love pleads with passion disarrayed, —</p>
<p>“A brother’s words must be obeyed.”</p>
<p>I pray you, dear,</p>
<p>Steal not the garden down,</p>
<p>Nor break my sandal trees;</p>
<p>Not that I care for these,</p>
<p>But oh, I dread the talk of town.</p>
<p>Should lovers have their wilful way,</p>
<p>Whatever would the neighbors say ? 28</p>
<p>And another — the most nearly perfect, or the most excellently
translated, of all — reveals to us the ageless antiquity of
sentiment:</p>
<p>The morning glory climbs above my head,</p>
<p>Pale flowers of white and purple, blue and red.</p>
<p>I am disquieted.</p>
<p>Down in the withered grasses something stirred;</p>
<p>I thought it was his footfall that I heard.</p>
<p>Then a grasshopper clyrred.</p>
<p>I climbed the hill just as the new moon showed,</p>
<p>I saw him coming on the southern road,</p>
<p>My heart lays down its load.“</p>

<p>The characteristic production of this epoch is philosophy. It is
no</p>
<p>discredit to our species that in all ages its curiosity has outrun
its wisdom, and its ideals have set an impossible pace for its behavior.
As far back as 1250 b.c. we find Yu Tze sounding the keynote in a pithy
fragment then already stale, and now still fresh in counsel to laborious
word-</p>
<p>mongers who do not know that all glory ends in bitterness: “He who
renounces fame has no sorrow”“— happy the man who has no history! From
that time until our own, China has produced philosophers.</p>
<p>As India is par excellence the land of metaphysics and religion,
China is by like preeminence the home of humanistic, or non-theological,
phi- losophy. Almost the only important work of metaphysics in its
literature is the strange document with which the recorded history of
Chinese thought begins — the 1 - Ching, or “Book of Changes.” Tradition
insist s that it was written in prison by one of the founders of the
Chou Dynasty, Wen Wang, and that its simplest origin went back as far as
Fu Hsi: this legendary emperor, we are told, invented the eight kua , or
mystic tri- grams, which Chinese metaphysics identifies with the laws
and elements of nature. Each trigram consisted of three lines — some
continuous and representing the male principle or yang, some broken and
representing the female principle or yin. In this mystic dualism the
yang represented also the positive, active, productive and celestial
principle of light, heat and life, while the yin represented the
negative, passive and earthly prin- ciple of darkness, cold and death.
Wen Wang immortalized himself, and racked the head of a billion Chinese,
by doubling the number of strokes, and thereby raising to sixty-four the
number of possible combinations of continuous and broken lines. To each
of these arrangements some law of nature corresponded. All science and
history were contained in the changeful interplay of the combinations;
all wisdom lay hidden in the sixty-four hsiangs, or ideas symbolically
represented by the trigrams; ultimately all reality could be reduced to
the opposition and union of the two basic factors in the universe — the
male and the female principles, the yang and the yin. The Chinese used
the Book of Changes as a manual of divination, and considered it the
greatest of their classics; he who should</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 651</p>
<p>understand the combinations, we are told, would grasp all the laws of
nature. Confucius, who edited the volume and adorned it with commen-
taries, ranked it above all other writings, and wished that he might be
free to spend fifty years in its study . 81</p>
<p>This strange volume, though congenial to the subtle occultism of the
Chinese soul, is alien to the positive and practical spirit of Chinese
phi- losophy. As far back as we can pry into the past of China we
find</p>
<p>philosophers; but of those who preceded Lao-tze time has preserved
only an occasional fragment or an empty name. As in India, Persia, Judea
and Greece, the sixth and fifth centuries saw, in China, a brilliant
outburst of philosophical and literary genius; and as in Greece, it
began with an epoch of ration alist “enlightenment.” An age of war and
chaos opened new roads to the advancement of unpedigreed talent, and
established a demand, among the people of the towns, for instructors
skilled in impart- ing the arts of the mind. These popular teachers soon
discovered the uncertainty of theology, the relativity of morals and the
imperfections of governments, and began to lay about them with Utopias;
several of them were put to death by authorities who found it more
difficult to answer than to kill. According to one Chinese tradition
Confucius him- self, during his tenure of office as Minister of Crime in
the Duchy of Lu, condemned to death a seditious officer on the ground
that “he was capable of gathering about him large crowds of men; that
his arguments could easily appeal to the mob and make perversity
respectable; and that his sophistry was sufficiently recalcitrant to
take a stand against the accepted judgments of right .” 88 Szuma -
Ch’ien accepts the story; some other Chinese historians reject it ; 88
let us hope that it is not true.</p>
<p>The most famous of these intellectual rebels was Teng Shih, who was
executed by the Duke of Cheng during the youth of Confucius. Teng, says
the Book of Lieh- tze, “taught the doctrines of the relativity of right
a nd wrong, and employed inexhaustible arguments .” 84 His enemies
charged</p>
<p>A wealthy man of Teng’s native state was drowned in the Wei</p>
<p>River, and his body was taken up by a man who demanded of the</p>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>bereaved family a large sum of money for its redemption. The dead
man’s family sought Teng’s counsel. “Wait,” said the Sophist;</p>
<p>“no other family will pay for the body.” The advice was followed,</p>
<p>and the man who held the corpse became anxious and also came to Teng
Shih for advice. The Sophist gave the same counsel: “Wait;</p>
<p>nowhere else can they obtain the body.” 85</p>
<p>Teng Shih composed a code of penology that proved too idealistic for
the government of Cheng. Annoyed by pamphlets in which Teng criticized
his policies, the prime minister prohibited the posting of pamphlets in
public places. Teng thereupon delivered his pamphlets in person. The
minister forbade the delivery of pamphlets. Teng smuggled them to his
readers by concealing them in other articles. The government ended the
argument by cutting off his head. 85</p>

<p>Lao-tze, greatest of the pre-Confucian philosophers, was wiser than
Teng Shih; he knew the wisdom of silence, and lived, we may be sure, to
a ripe old age — though we are not sure that he lived at all. The
Chinese historian, Szuma Ch’ien, tells how Lao -tze, disgusted with the
knavery of politicians and tired of his work as curator of the Royal
Library of</p>
<p>Chou, determined to leave China and seek some distant and secluded
country side. “On reaching the frontier the warden, Yin Hsi, said to
him: ‘So you are going into retirement. I beg you to write a book for
me.’</p>
<p>Thereupon Lao-tze wrote a book, in two parts, on Tao and Te,
extending to over five thousand words. He then went away, and no one
knows where he died.”” Tradition, which knows everything, credits him
with living eighty-seven years. All that remains of him is his name and
his book, neither of which may have belonged to him. Lao-tze is a
description, meaning “The Old Master”; his real name, we are told, was
Li— that is to say, a plum. The book which is ascribed to him is of such
doubtful</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 653</p>
<p>authenticity that scholars quarrel learnedly about its origin.* But
all are agreed that the T ao-T e-Ching — i.e., the “Book of the Way and
of Vir - tue”— is the most important text of that Taoist philosophy
which, in the opinion of Chinese students, existed long before Lao-tze,
found many first- rate defenders after him, and became the religion of a
considerable minority of the Chinese from his time to our own. The
authorship of the Tao-Te- Ching is a secondary matter; but its ideas are
among the most fascinating in the history of thought.</p>
<p>Tao means the Way: ’sometimes the Way of Nature, sometimes the Taoist
Way of wise living; literally, a road. Basically, it is a way of</p>
<p>thinking, or of refusing to think; for in the view of the Taoists
thought is a superficial affair, good only for argument, and more
harmful than bene- ficial to life; the Way is to be found by rejecting
the intellect and all its wares, and leading a modest life of
retirement, rusticity, and quiet con- templation of nature. Knowledge is
not virtue; on the contrary, rascals have increased since education
spread. Knowledge is not wisdom, for nothing is so far from a sage as an
“intellectual.” The worst conceivable government would be by
philosophers; they botch every natural process with theory; their
ability to make speeches and multiply ideas is pre- cisely the sign of
their incapacity for action.</p>
<p>Those who are skilled do not dispute; the disputatious are not</p>
<p>skilled. . . . When we renounce learning we have no troubles. . .
.</p>
<p>The sage constantly keeps men without knowledge and without</p>
<p>desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, keeps them from
presuming to act. . . . The ancients who showed their skill</p>
<p>in practising the T ao did so not to enlighten the people, but to
make them simple and ignorant. . . . The difficulty in governing the
peo-</p>
<p>ple arises from their having too much knowledge. He who tries to</p>
<p>govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it, while he who
does</p>
<p>not do so is a blessing.“</p>
<p>The intellectual man is a danger to the state because he thinks in
terms of regulations and laws; he wishes to construct a society like
geometry, and does not realize that such regulation destroys the living
freedom and</p>

<p>vigor of the parts. The simpler man, who knows from his own experi-
ence the pleasure and efficacy of work conceived and carried out in lib-
erty, is less of a peril when he is in power, for he does not have to be
told that a law is a dangerous thing, and may injure more than it may
help . 41 Such a ruler regulates men as little as possible; if he guides
the nation it is away from all artifice and complexity towards a normal
and artless simplicity, in which life would follow the wisely
thoughtless routine of nature, and even writing would be put aside as an
unnatural instrument of befuddlement and deviltry. Unhampered by
regulations from the gov- ernment, the spontaneous economic impulses of
the people — their own lust for bread and love — would move the wheels
of life in a simple and wholesome round. There would be few inventions,
for these only add to the wealth of the rich and the power of the
strong; there would be no books, no lawyers, no industries, and only
village trade.</p>
<p>In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitions increases the</p>
<p>poverty of the people. The more implements to add to their profit</p>
<p>the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and
clan;</p>
<p>the more acts of crafty dexterity men possess, the more do
strange</p>
<p>contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation,
the</p>
<p>more thieves and robbers there are. Therefore a sage has said:</p>
<p>“I will do nothing, and the people will be transformed of them -</p>
<p>selves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of
them-</p>
<p>selves be correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people
will</p>
<p>of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the</p>
<p>people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity. . .
.</p>
<p>In a little state with a small population I would so order it
that</p>
<p>though there would be individuals in it with the abilities of ten
or</p>
<p>a hundred men, there should be no employment for them; I would</p>
<p>make the people, while looking upon death as a grievous thing,
yet</p>
<p>not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). Though they had boats and</p>
<p>carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though</p>
<p>they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no oc-</p>
<p>casion to don or use them. I would make the people return to the</p>
<p>use of knotted cords.* They should think their (coarse) food</p>
<p>sweet, their (plain) clothes beautiful, their (poor) dwellings
places</p>
<p>of rest, and their common ways sources of enjoyment. There should</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 655</p>
<p>be a neighboring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls
and</p>
<p>dogs should be heard all the way from it to us; but I would make</p>
<p>the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse</p>
<p>with it.”“</p>
<p>But what is this nature which Lao-tze wishes to accept as his guide?
The Old Master draws as sharp a distinction between nature and civiliza-
tion as Rousseau was to do in that gallery of echoes called “modem</p>
<p>thought.” Nature is natural activity, the silent flow of traditional
events, the majestic order of the seasons and the sky; it is the Tao, or
Way, exem- plified and embodied in every brook and rock and star; it is
that impartial, impersonal and yet rational law of things to which the
law of conduct must conform if men desire to live in wisdom and peace.
This law of things is the Tao or way of the universe, just as the law of
conduct is the Tao or way of life; in truth, thinks Lao-tze, both Taos
are one, and</p>
<p>human life, in its essential and wholesome rhythm, is part of the
rhythm of the world. In that cosmic Tao all the laws of nature are
united and form together the Spinozistic substance of all reality; in it
all natural forms and varieties find a proper place, and all apparent
diversities and contra- dictions meet; it is the Absolute in which all
particulars are resolved into one Hegelian unity.“</p>
<p>In the ancient days, says Lao, nature made men and life simple and
peace- ful, and all the world was happy. But then men attained
“knowledge,” they complicated life with inventions, they lost all mental
and moral inno- cence, they moved from the fields to the cities, and
began to write books; hence all the misery of men, and the tears of the
philosophers. The wise man will shun this urban complexity, this
corrupting and enervating maze of law and civilization, and will hide
himself in the lap of nature, far from any town, or books, or venal
officials, or vain reformers. The secret of wisdom and of that quiet
content which is the only lasting happiness that man can find, is a
Stoic obedience to nature, an abandonment of all artifice and intellect,
a trustful acceptance of nature’s imperatives in instinct and feeling, a
modest imitation of nature’s silent ways. Perhaps there is no wiser
passage in literature than this:</p>
<p>All things in nature work silently. They come into being and</p>
<p>possess nothing. They fulfil their function and make no claim.
All</p>
<p>things alike do their work, and then we see them subside. When</p>
<p>they have reached their bloom each returns to its origin. Return-</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>ing to their origin means rest, or fulfilment of destiny. This
re-</p>
<p>version is an eternal law. To know that law is wisdom.“</p>
<p>Quiescence, a kind of philosophical inaction, a refusal to interfere
with the natural courses of things, is the mark of the wise man in every
field. If the state is in disorder, the proper thing to do is not to
reform it, but to make one’s life an orderly performance of duty; if
resistance is encoun- tered, the wiser course is not to quarrel, fight,
or make war, but to retire silently, and to win, if at all, through
yielding and patience; passivity has its victories more often than
action. Here Lao-tze talks almost with the accents of Christ:</p>
<p>If you do not quarrel, no one on earth will be able to quarrel
with</p>
<p>you. . . . Recompense injury with kindness. . . . To those who</p>
<p>are good I am good, and to those who are not good I am also</p>
<p>good; thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere I am
sin-</p>
<p>cere, and to those who are not sincere I am also sincere; and
thus</p>
<p>(all) get to be sincere. . . . The softest thing in the world
dashes</p>
<p>against and overcomes the hardest. . . . There is nothing in the</p>
<p>world softer or weaker than water, and yet for attacking things</p>
<p>that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take
precedence</p>
<p>of it.*“</p>
<p>All these doctrines culminate in Lao’s conception of the sage. It is
char - acteristic of Chinese thought that it speaks not of saints but of
sages, not so much of goodness as of wisdom; to the Chinese the ideal is
not the pious devotee but the mature and quiet mind, the man who, though
fit to hold high place in the world, retires to simplicity and silence.
Silence is the beginning of wisdom. Even of the Tao and wisdom the wise
man does not speak, for wisdom can be transmitted never by words, only
by ex- ample and experience. “He who knows (the Way) does not speak
about it; he who speaks about it does not know it. He (who knows it)
will keep his mouth shut and close the portals of his nostrils.”“ The
wise man is modest, for at fiftyf one should have discovered the
relativity of knowl- edge and the frailty of wisdom; if the wise man
knows more than other men he tries to conceal it; “he will tem per his
brightness, and bring him-</p>
<ul>
<li>He adds, with reckless gallantry: “The female always overcomes the
male by her</li>
</ul>
<p>fThe Chinese think of the sage as reaching the maturity of his powers
about the age of fifty, and living, through quietude and wisdom, to a
century . 48</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 657</p>
<p>self into agreement with the obscurity (of others);“ he agrees with
the simple rather than with the learned, and does not suffer from the
novice’s instinct of contradiction. He attaches no importance to riches
or power, but reduces his desires to an almost Buddhist minimum:</p>
<p>I have nothing that I value; I desire that my heart be completely</p>
<p>subdued, emptied to emptiness. . . . The state of emptiness
should</p>
<p>be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with
unwearying vigor. . . . Such a man cannot be treated familiarly or</p>
<p>distantly; he is beyond all considerations of profit or injury,
of</p>
<p>nobility or meanness; he is the noblest man under heaven .“ 0</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to point out the detailed correspondence of these
ideas with those of Jean- Jacques Rousseau; the two men were coins of
the same mould and mint, however different in date. It is a philosophy
that period- ically reappears, for in every generation many men weary of
the struggle, cruelty, complexity and speed of city life, and write with
more idealism than knowledge about the joys of rustic routine: one must
have a long urban background in order to write rural poetry. “Nature” is
a te rm</p>
<p>that may lend itself to any ethic and any theology; it fits the
science of Darwin and the unmorality of Nietzsche more snugly than the
sweet rea- sonableness of Lao-tze and Christ. If one follows nature and
acts naturally he is much more likely to murder and eat his enemies than
to practise philosophy; there is small chance of his being humble, and
less of his being silent. Even the painful tillage of the soil goes
against the grain of a</p>
<p>species primordially wont to hunt and kill; agriculture is a s
“unnatural” as industry. — And yet there is something medicinal in this
philosophy; we suspect that we, too, when our fires begin to bum low,
shall see wisdom in it, and shall want the healing peace of uncrowded
mountains and spa- cious fields. Life oscillates between Voltaire and
Rousseau, Confucius and Lao-tze, Socrates and Christ. After every idea
has had its day with us and we have fought for it not wisely or too
well, we in our turn shall tire of the battle, and pass on to the young
our thinning fascicle of ideals. Then we shall take to the woods with
Jacques, Jean-Jacques and Lao-tze; we shall make friends of the animals,
and discourse more contentedly than Machiavelli with simple peasant
minds; we shall leave the world to stew in its own deviltry, and shall
take no further thought of its reform. Perhaps we shall bum every book
but one behind us, and find a summary of</p>
<p>wisdom in the Tao-Te-Ching.</p>
<p>658 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>We may imagine how irritating this philosophy must have been to Con-
fucius, who, at the immature age of thirty-four, came up to Lo-yang,
capital of Chou, and sought the Old Master’s advice on some minutiae of
history.* Lao-tze, we are told, replied with harsh and cryptic
brevity:</p>
<p>Those about whom you inquire have moulded with their bones</p>
<p>into dust. Nothing but their words remain. When the hour of</p>
<p>the great man has struck he rises to leadership; but before his
time</p>
<p>has come he is hampered in all that he attempts. I have heard
that</p>
<p>the successful merchant carefully conceals his wealth, and acts
as</p>
<p>though he had nothing — that the great man, though abounding in</p>
<p>achievements, is simple in his manners and appearance. Get rid of</p>
<p>your pride and your many ambitions, your affectation and your ex-</p>
<p>travagant aims. Your character gains nothing for all these. This</p>
<p>is my advice to you. 01</p>
<p>The Chinese historian relates that Confucius sensed at once the
wisdom of these words, and took no offense from them; that on the
contrary he said to his pupils, on his return from the dying sage: “I
know how birds can fly, fishes swim, and animals run. But the runner may
be snared, the swimmer hooked, and the flyer shot by the arrow. But
there is the dragon — I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through
the clouds, and rises to heaven. Today I have seen Lao-tze, and can
compare him only to the dragon.” 00 Then the new master went forth to
fulfil his own mission, and to become the most influential philosopher
in history.</p>

<p>rival lore, tells how apparitions announced his illegitimate birth 1
® to his young mother, how dragons kept watch, and spirit-ladies
perfumed the air, as she was delivered of him in a cave. He had, we are
informed, the back of a dragon, the lips of an ox, and a mouth like the
sea . 04 He came of the oldest family now in existence, for (the Chinese
genealogists assure us) he was derived in direct line from the great
emperor Huang-ti, and was destined to be the father of a long succession
of K’ungs, unbroken to this day. His descendants numbered eleven
thousand males a century ago; the town of his birth is still populated
almost entirely by the fruit of his loins — or those of his only son;
and one of his progeny is Finance Minister of the present Chinese
Government at Nanking . 60</p>
<p>His father was seventy years old when K’ung w as born , 00 and died
when the boy was three. Confucius worked after school to help support
his mother, and took on in childhood, perhaps, that aged gravity which
was to mark nearly every step of his history. Nevertheless he had time
to be- come skilled in archery and music; to the latter he became so
addicted that once, hearing an especially delectable performance, he was
moved to the point of vegetarianism: for three months he did not eat
meat.“ He did not immediately agree with Nietzsche about a certain
incompatibility between philosophy and marriage. He married at nineteen,
divorced his wife at twenty-three, and does not seem to have married
again.</p>
<p>At twenty- two’ he began his career as a teacher, using his home as a
schoolhouse, and charging whatever modest fee his pupils could pay.
Three subjects formed the substance of his curriculum: history, poetry,
and the rules of propriety. “A man’s character,” he said, “is formed by
the Odes, developed by the Rites” (the rules of ceremony and courte sy),
“and perfected by music .” 08 Like Socrates he taught by word of mouth
rather than by writing, and we know his views chiefly through the unre-
liable reports of his disciples. He gave to philosophers an example
seldom heeded — to attack no other thinker, and waste no time in
refutations. He taught no strict logical method, but he sharpened the
wits of his students by gently exposing their fallacies, and making stem
demands upon their alertness of mind. “When a man is not (in the habit
of) saying, ‘What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?’ I
can indeed do nothing with him .” 00 “I do not open up the truth to one
who is not eager, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain
himself. When I have presented one comer of a subject to any one, and he
cannot from it leam the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.”” He was
confident that only the wisest</p>
<p>660 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>and the stupidest were beyond benefiting from instruction, and that
no one could sincerely study humanistic philosophy without being
improved in character as well as in mind. “It is not easy to find a man
who has</p>
<p>learned for three years without coming to be good .” 71</p>
<p>He had at first only a few pupils, but soon the news went about that
behind the lips of an ox and the mouth like a sea there was a kindly
heart and a well-furnished mind, and in the end he could boast that
three thou- sand young men had studied under him, and had passed from
his home to important positions in the world. Some of the students —
once as many as seventy — lived with him like Hindu novices with their
guru ; and they de- veloped an affection that often spoke out in their
remonstrances against his exposure of his person to danger, or of his
good name to calumny. Though always strict with them, he loved some of
them more than his own son, and wept without measure when Hwuy died.
“There was Yen Hwuy,” he replied to Duke Gae, who had asked which of his
pupils</p>
<p>learned best; “he loved to learn. … I hav e not yet heard of any one
who loves to learn (as he did). . . . Hwuy gave me no assistance; there
was nothing that I said which did not give him delight. . . . He did not
trans- fer his anger; he did not repeat a fault. Unfortunately, his
appointed time was short, and he died; and now there is not (such
another).”” Lazy</p>
<p>students avoided him, or received short shrift from him; for he was
not above instructing a sluggard with a blow of his staff, and sending
him off with merciless verity. “Hard is the case of him who will stuff
himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything.
… In youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood doing nothing
worthy of being handed down; and living on to an old age — this is to be
a pest.”” He must have made a queer picture as he stood in his rooms,
or, with nearly equal readiness, in the road, and taught his disciples
history and poetry, manners and philosophy. The portraits that Chinese
painters begot of him show him in his later years, with an almost
hairless head gnarled and knotted with experience, and a face whose
terrifying serious- ness gave no inkling of the occasional humor and
tenderness, and the keen esthetic sensitivity, that made him human
despite his otherwise unbear- able perfection. One of his music-teachers
described him as he was in early middle age:</p>
<p>I have observed about Chung-ni many marks of a sage. He has</p>
<p>river eyes and a dragon forehead — the very characteristics of
Huang-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 66l</p>
<p>ti. His arms are long, his back is like a tortoise, and he is
nine</p>
<p>(Chinese) feet six inches in height. . . . When he speaks he</p>
<p>praises the ancient kings. He moves along the path of humility and*
courtesy. He has heard of every subject, and retains with a strong</p>
<p>memory. His knowledge of things seems inexhaustible. Have we</p>
<p>not in him the rising of a sage ? 74</p>
<p>Legend assigns to his figure “forty - nine remarkable peculiarities.”
Once, when accident had separated him from his disciples during his
wanderings, they located him at once by the report of a traveler that he
had seen a monstrous- looking man with “the disconsolate appearance of a
stray dog.” When they repeated this description to Confucius he was much
amused. “Capital!” he said, “capital !” 76</p>
<p>He was an old-fashioned teacher, who believed that the maintenance of
distance was indispensable to pedagogy. He was nothing if not formal,
and the rules of etiquette and courtesy were his meat and drink. He
tried to check and balance the natural epicureanism of the instincts
with the puritanism and stoicism of his doctrine. At times he appears to
have in- dulged himself in self- appreciation. “In a hamlet of ten
families,” he said, with some moderation, “there may be found one
honorab le and sincere as I am, but not so fond of learning .” 70 “In
letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but (the character of) the
higher man, carrying out in his con- duct what he professes, is what I
have not yet attained to .” 77 “If there were any of the princes who
would employ me, in the course of twelve months I should have done
something considerable. In three years (the government) would be
perfected .” 76 All in all, however, he bore his great - ness with
modesty. “There were four things,” hi s disciples assure us, “from which
the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclu - sions, no
arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism .” 76 He called
himself “a transmitter and not a maker ,” 60 and pretended that he was
merely passing down what he had learned from the good emperors Yao and
Shun. He strongly desired fame and place, but he would make no
dishonorable compromises to secure or retain them; again and again he
refused appointments to high office from men whose government seemed to
him unjust. A man should say, he counseled his scholars, “I am not
concerned that I have no place; I am concerned how I may fit myself for
one. I am not concerned that I am not known; I seek to be worthy to be
known .” 61</p>
<p>662 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Among his pupils were the sons of Mang He, one of the ministers of
the Duke of Lu. Through them Confucius was introduced to the Chou court
at Lo-yang; but he kept a modest distance from the officials, pre-
ferring, as we have seen, to visit the dying sage Lao-tze. Returning to
Lu, Confucius found his native province so disordered with civil strife
that he removed to the neighboring state of T’si, accompanied by several
of his pupils. Passing through rugged and deserted mountains on their
way, they were surprised to find an old woman weeping beside a grave.
Con- fucius sent Tsze- loo to inquire the cause of her grief. “My
husband’s father,” she answered, “was killed here by a tiger, and my
husband also; and now my son has met the same fate.” When Confucius
asked why she persisted in living in so dangerous a place, she replied:
“There is no op - pressive government here.” “My children,” said
Confucius to his students, “remember this. Oppressive government is
fiercer than a tiger.” 62</p>
<p>The Duke of Ts’i gave him audience, and was pleased with his answer
to a question about good government. “There is good government when the
prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is
father, and the son is s on,” 86 The Duke offered him for his support
the revenues of the town of Lin- k’ew, but Confucius refused the gift,
saying that he had done nothing to deserve such remuneration. The Duke
was minded to insist on retaining him as an adviser, when his chief
minister dissuaded him. “These scholars,” said Gan Ying, “are
impractical, and cannot be imitated. They are haughty and conceited of
their own views, so that they will not be content in inferior positions.
. . . This Mr. K’ung has a thousand peculiarities. It would take
generations to exhaust all that he knows about the ceremonies of going
up and going down.” 84 Nothing came of it, and Confucius returned to Lu,
to teach his pupils for fifteen years more before being called into
public office.</p>
<p>His opportunity came when, at the turn of the century, he was made
chief magistrate of the town of Chung-tu. According to Chinese tradi-
tion a veritable epidemic of honesty swept through the city; articles of
value dropped in the street were left untouched, or returned to the
owner. 86 Promoted by Duke Ting of Lu to be Acting Superintendent of
Public Works, Confucius directed a survey of the lands of the state, and
introduced many improvements in agriculture. Advanced again to be
Minister of Crime, his appointment, we are told, sufficed of itself to
put an end to crime. “Dishonesty and dissoluteness,” say the Chinese
records, “were ashamed, and hid their heads. Loyalty and good faith
became the</p>
<p>CHAP.XXin) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 663</p>
<p>characteristics of the men, and chastity and docility those of the
women. Strangers came in crowds from other states. Confucius became the
idol of the people .” 80</p>
<p>This is too good to be true, and in any case proved too good to
endure. Criminals put their hidden heads together, no doubt, and laid
snares for the Master’s feet. Neighboring states, say the historian,
grew jealous of Lu, and fearful of its rising power. A wily minister of
Ts’i suggested a</p>
<p>stratagem to alienate the Duke of Lu from Confucius. The Duke of Ts’i
sent to Ting a bevy of lovely “sing - song” girls, and one hundred
and</p>
<p>twenty still more beautiful horses. The Duke of Lu was captivated,
ig- nored the disapproval of Confucius (who had taught him that the
first principle of good government is good example), and
scandalously</p>
<p>neglected his ministers and the affairs of the state. “Master,” said
Tsze -loo, “it is time for you to be going.” Reluctantly Confucius
resigned, left Lu, and began thirteen years of homeless wandering. He
remarked later that he had never “seen one who loves virtue as he loves
beauty,”” and indeed, from some points of view, it is one of the most
culpable oversights of nature that virtue and beauty so often come in
separate packages.</p>
<p>The Master and a few faithful disciples, no longer welcome in his
native state, passed now from province to province, receiving courtesies
in some, undergoing dangers and privations in others. Twice they were
attacked by ruffians, and once they were reduced almost to starvation,
so that even Tsze-loo began to murmur that such a lot was hardly
appropriate to the “higher man.” The Duke of Wei offered Confucius the
leadership of his government, but Confucius, disapproving of the Duke’s
principles, re - fused . 88 Once, as the little ban d was traveling
through Ts’i, it came upon two old men who, in disgust with the
corruption of the age, had retired like Lao-tze from public affairs and
taken to a life of agricultural seclusion. One of them recognized
Confucius, and reproached Tsze-loo for follow- ing him. “Disorder, like
a swelling flood,” said the recluse, “spreads over</p>
<p>than follow one who withdraws from this state and that state, had you
not better follow those wh o withdraw from the world altogether ?” 80
Confucius gave much thought to this rebuke, but persisted in hoping that
some state would again give him an opportunity to lead the way to reform
and peace.</p>
<p>At last, in the sixty-ninth year of Confucius, Duke Gae succeeded
to</p>
<p>the throne of Lu, and sent three officers to the philosopher, bearing
ap-</p>
<p>664 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>propriate presents and an invitation to return to his native state.
During the five years of life that remained to him Confucius lived in
simplicity and honor, often consulted by the leaders of Lu, but wisely
retiring to a literary seclusion, and devoting himself to the congenial
work of editing the classics, and writing the history, of his people.
When the Duke of Shi asked Tsze-loo about his master, and Tsze-loo did
not answer him, Confucius, hearing of it, said: “Why did you not say to
him?— He is sim- ply a man who, in his eager pursuit of knowledge,
forgets his food; who in the joy (of its attainment) forgets his
sorrows; and who does not per- ceive that old age is coming on .” 90 He
consoled his solitude with poetry and philosophy, and rejoiced that his
instincts now accorded with his rea- son. “At fifteen,” he said, “I had
my mind bent on learning. At thirty I stood firm. At forty I was free
from doubt. At fifty I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty my ear was
an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy I could follow
what my heart desired without trans- gressing what was right.””</p>
<p>He died at the age of seventy-two. Early one morning he was heard</p>
<p>singing a mournful song:</p>
<p>The great mountain must crumble,</p>
<p>The strong beam must break,</p>
<p>And the wise man wither away like a plant.</p>
<p>When his pupil Tsze- kung came to him he said: “No inte lligent
monarch arises; there is not one in the empire that will make me his
master. My time is come to die .” 2 03 He took to his couch, and after
seven days he expired. His students buried him with pomp and ceremony
befitting their affection for him; and building huts by his grave they
lived there for three years, mourning for him as for a father. When all
the others had gone Tsze-kung, who had loved him even beyond the rest,
remained three years more, mourning alone by the Master’s tomb . 03</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Nine Classics</li>
</ol>
<p>He left behind him five volumes apparently written or edited by his
own hand, and therefore known to China as the “Five Ching,” or Canonical
Books. First, he edited the Li-Chi, or Record of Rites, believing that
these ancient rules of propriety were subtle aides to the formation and
mellowing of character, and the maintenance of social order and peace.
Second, he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 665</p>
<p>wrote appendices and commentaries for the I-Ching , or Book 0)
Changes , seeing in this the profoundest contribution yet made by China
to that ob- scure realm of metaphysics which he himself had sedulously
avoided in his philosophy. Third, he selected and arranged the Shi-Ching
, or Book of Odes , in order to illustrate the nature of human life and
the principles of moral- ity. Fourth, he wrote the Ch’un Ch’iu , or
Spring and Autumn Annals , to record with unadorned brevity the main
events in the history of his own state of Lu. Fifth, and above all, he
sought to inspire his pupils by gather- ing into a Shu-Ching , or Book
of History , the most important and elevating events or legends of the
early reigns, when China had been in some measure a unified empire, and
its leaders, as Confucius thought, had been heroic and unselfish
civilizers of the race. He did not think of his function, in these
works, as that of an historian; rather he was a teacher, a moulder of
youth; and he deliberately selected from the past such items as would
rather in- spire than disillusion his pupils; we should do him injustice
if we turned to these volumes for an impartial and scientific account of
Chinese history. He added to the record imaginary speeches and stories
into which he poured as much as he could of his solicitude for morals
and his admiration for wis- dom. If he idealized the past of his country
he did no more than we do with our own less ancient past; if already our
earliest presidents have become sages and saints in hardly a century or
two, surely to the historians of a thousand years hence they will seem
as virtuous and perfect as Yao and Shun.</p>
<p>To these five Ching the Chinese add four Shu , or “Books” (of the</p>
<p>Philosophers), to constitute the “Nine Classics.” First and most
important of these is the Lun Yu, or Discourses and Dialogues , known to
the English world, through a whim of Legge’s, as the “Analects”— i.e.,
the collected fragments — of Confucius. These pages are not from the
Master’s hand, but record, with exemplary clarity and brevity, his
opinions and pronounce- ments as remembered by his followers. They were
compiled within a few decades of Confucius’ death, perhaps by the
disciples of his disciples , 04 and are the least unreliable guide that
we have to his philosophy. The most in- teresting and instructive of all
statements in the Chinese Classics appears in the fourth and fifth
paragraphs* of the second Shu — a work known to the Chinese as Ta Hsueh,
or The Great Learning. The Confucian philosopher and editor, Chu Hsi,
attributed these paragraphs to Confucius, and the re- mainder of the
treatise to Tseng Ts’an, one of the younger disciples; Kea Kwei, a
scholar of the first century a.d., attributed the work to K’ung Chi,
grandson of Confucius; the sceptical scholars of today agree that the
au-</p>
<p>Quoted on p. 668 below.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>thorship is unknown.” 5 All students concur in ascribing to this
grandson the third philosophical classic of China, the Chung Yung , or
Doctrine of the Mean. The last of the Shu is the Book of Mencius, of
which we shall speak presently. With this volume ends the classic
literature, but not the classic period, of Chinese thought. There were,
as we shall see, rebels and heretics of every kind to protest against
that masterpiece of conservatism, the phil- osophy of Confucius.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Agnosticism of Confucius</li>
</ol>
<p>A fragment of logic — The philosopher and the urchins — A</p>
<p>formula of wisdom</p>
<p>Let us try to do justice to this doctrine; it is the view of life
that we</p>
<p>shall take when we round out our first half-century, and for all that
we know it may be wiser than the poetry of our youth. If we ourselves
are heretics and young, this is the philosophy that we must marry to our
own in order that our half-truths may beget some understanding.</p>
<p>We shall not find here a system of philosophy — i.e., a consistent
struc- ture of logic, metaphysics, ethics and politics dominated by one
idea (like the palaces of Nebuchadrezzar, which bore on every brick the
name of the ruler). Confucius taught the art of reasoning not through
rules or syllogisms, but by the perpetual play of his keen mind upon the
opinions of his pupils; when they went out from his school they knew
nothing about logic, but they could think clearly and to the point.
Clarity and honesty of thought and expression were the first lessons of
the Master. “The whole end of speech is to be understood”” 6 — a lesson
not always re- membered by philosophy. “When you know a thing, to hold
that you know it; and when you do not, to admit the fact — this is
knowledge.”” Obscurity of thought and insincere inaccuracy of speech
seemed to him national calamities. If a prince who was not in actual
fact and power a prince should cease to be called a prince, if a father
who was not a</p>
<p>fatherly father should cease to be called a father, if an unfilial
son should cease to be called a son — then men might be stirred to
reform abuses too often covered up with words. Hence when Tsze-loo told
Confucius,</p>
<p>“The prince of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to</p>
<p>administer the government; what will you consider the first thing to
be done?” he answered, to the astonishment of prince and pupil, “What is
necessary is to rectify names.” 86</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 667</p>
<p>Since his dominating passion was the application of philosophy to
con- duct and government, Confucius avoided metaphysics, and tried to
turn the minds of his followers from all recondite or celestial
concerns. Though he made occasional mention of “Heaven” a nd prayer, 08
and counseled his disciples to observe sedulously the traditional rites
of ancestor worship and national sacrifice,” 0 he was so negative in his
answers to theological questions that modem commentators agree in
calling him an agnostic.” 1 When Tsze- kung asked him, “Do the dead have
knowledge, or are they without knowledge?” Confucius refused to make any
definite reply .”* When Ke Loo asked about “serving the spirits” (of the
dead), the Master responded: “While you are not able to serve men, how
can you serve their spirits?” Ke Loo asked: “I venture to ask about
death?” and was an -</p>
<p>swered: “While you do not know life, how can you know about death?”“
1 When Fan Ch’e inquired “what constituted wisdom?” Confucius said: “To
give one’s sel f earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respect-
ing spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.”
101 His disciples tell us that “the subjects on which the Master did not
talk were extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and
spiritual</p>
<p>beings.”” 5 They were much disturbed by this philosophic modesty, and
doubtless wished that the Master would solve for them the mysteries of
heaven. The Book of Lieh-tze tells with glee the fable of the
street-</p>
<p>urchins who ridiculed the Master when he confessed his inability to
answer their simple question — “Is the sun nearer to the earth at dawn,
when it is larger, or at noon, when it is hotter?”“ 0 The only
metaphysics that Con - fucius would recognize was the search for unity
in all phenomena, and the effort to find some stabilizing harmony
between the laws of right conduct and the regularities of natiire.
“Tsze,” he said to one of his favorites, “you think, I suppose, that I
am one who learns many things and keeps them in his memory?” Tsze - kung
replied, “Yes, but perhaps it is not so?” “No,” was the answer; “I seek
unity, all - pervading.”” 1 This, after all, is the essence of
philosophy.</p>
<p>His master passion was for morality. The chaos of his time seemed to
him a moral chaos, caused perhaps by the weakening of the ancient faith
and the spread of Sophist scepticism as to right and wrong; it was to be
cured not by a return to the old beliefs, but by an earnest search for
more complete knowledge, and a moral regeneration based upon a soundly
regulated family life. The Confucian program is expressed pithily and
profoundly in the famous paragraphs of The Great Learning :</p>
<p>668</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>The ancients who wished to illustrate the highest virtue through-</p>
<p>out the empire first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order
well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to
reg-</p>
<p>ulate their families, they first cultivated their own selves. Wishing
to cultivate their own selves, they first rectified their hearts.
Wish-</p>
<p>ing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in
their</p>
<p>thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first ex-</p>
<p>tended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowl-</p>
<p>edge lay in the investigation of things.</p>
<p>Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their</p>
<p>knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their</p>
<p>thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their
hearts being rectified, their own selves were cultivated. Their own
selves</p>
<p>being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families
being</p>
<p>regulated, they’ states were rightly governed. Their states being</p>
<p>rightly governed, the whole empire was made tranquil and happy. 1
“</p>
<p>This is the keynote and substance of the Confucian philosophy;
one</p>
<p>might forget all other words of the Master and his disciples, and yet
carry away with these “the essence of the matter,” and a complete guide
to life. The world is at war, says Confucius, because its constituent
states are im- properly governed; these are improperly governed because
no amount of legislation can take the place of the natural social order
provided by the family; the family is in disorder, and fails to provide
this natural social order, because men forget that they cannot regulate
their families if they do not regulate themselves; they fail to regulate
themselves because they have not rectified their hearts — i.e., they
have not cleansed their own souls of disorderly desires; their hearts
are not rectified because their thinking is insincere, doing scant
justice to reality and concealing rather than re- vealing their own
natures; their thinking is insincere because they let their wishes
discolor the facts and determine their conclusions, instead of seeking
to extend their knowledge to the utmost by impartially investi- gating
the nature of things. Let men seek impartial knowledge, and their
thinking will become sincere; let their thoughts be sincere and their
hearts will be cleansed of disorderly desires; let their hearts be so
cleansed, and their own selves will be regulated; let their own selves
be regulated, and their families will automatically be regulated — not
by virtuous sermonizing or passionate punishments, but by the silent
power of example itself; let the family be so regulated with knowledge,
sincerity and example, and it</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 669</p>
<p>will give forth such spontaneous social order that successful
government will once more be a feasible thing; let the state maintain
internal justice and tranquillity, and all the world will be peaceful
and happy. — It is a counsel of perfection, and forgets that man is a
beast of prey; but like Christianity it offers us a goal to strike at,
and a ladder to climb. It is one of the golden texts of philosophy.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Way of the Higher Man</li>
</ol>
<p>Another portrait of the sage — Elements of character — The</p>
<p>Golden Rule</p>
<p>Wisdom, therefore, begins at home, and the foundation of society is a
disciplined individual in a disciplined family. Confucius agreed with
Goethe that self-development is the root of social development; and when
Tsze- loo asked him, “What constitutes the Higher Man?” he re - plied,
“The cultivation of himself with reverential care.” 1 ” Here and there,
throughout the dialogues, we find him putting together, piece by piece,
his picture of the ideal man — a union of philosopher and saint
producing the sage. The Superman of Confucius is composed of three
virtues severally selected as supreme by Socrates, Nietzsche and Christ:
intelligence, courage, and good will. “The Higher Man is anxious lest he
should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon
him. . . . He is catholic, not partisan. . . . He requires that in what
he says there should be nothing inaccurate .” 110 But he is no mere
intellect, not merely a scholar or a lover of knowledge; he has
character as well as in- telligence. “Where the solid qualities are in
excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the accomplishments
are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk.
When the accomplishments and solid qualities are equally blended, we
then have the man of complete virtue .” 111 Intelligence is intellect
with it s feet on the earth.</p>
<p>The foundation of character is sincerity. “Is it not just an entire
sin -</p>
<p>cerity which marks the Higher Man ?” 112 “He acts before he speaks,
and afterwards speaks according to his actions .” 113 “In archery we
have some - thing like the way of the Higher Man. When the archer misses
the center of the target, he turns round and seeks for the cause of his
failure in him- self .” 114 “What the Higher Man seeks is in himself;
what the lower man seeks is in others. . . . The Higher Man is
distressed by his want of ability.</p>
<p>670 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>not … by men’s not knowing him”; and yet “he dislikes the thought of
his name not being mentioned after his death .” 116 He “is modest in his
speech, but exceeds in his actions. … He seldom speaks; when he does he
is sure to hit the point. . . . That wherein the Higher Man cannot be
equaled is simply this: his work, which other men cannot see .” n0 He is
moderate in word and deed; in everything “the Higher Man c onforms with
the path of the mean .” 117 For “there is no end of things by which man
is affected; and when his likings and dislikings are not subject to
regulation, he is changed into the nature of things as they come before
him.” n8 * “The Higher Man moves so as to make his movements in all
generations a universal path; he behaves so as to make his conduct in
all generations a universal law; he speaks so as to make his words in
all generations a universal norm.’ ,la0 + He accepts completely the
Golden Rule, which is here laid down explicitly four centuries before
Hillel and five centuries before Christ: “Chung -kung asked about
perfect virtue. The Master said, . . . ‘Not to do unto others as you
would not wish done unto yourself.’ ,ma The principle is stated again
and again, always negatively, and once in a single word. “Tsze -kung
asked, ‘Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all
one’s life?’ The Master said, ‘Is not reciprocity such a word ?’” 123
Nevertheless he did not wish, like Lao-tze, to return good for evil; and
when one of his pupils asked him, “What do you say concerning the
principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?” he replied,
more sharply than was his custom: “With what, then, will you recomp ense
kindness? Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with
kindness .” 124</p>
<p>The very basis of the Higher Man’s character is an overflowing
sympathy towards all men. He is not angered by the excellences of other
men; when he sees men of worth he thinks of equaling them; when he sees
men of low worth he turns inward and examines himself ; 12411 for there
are few faults that we do not share with our neighbors. He pays no
attention to slander or violent speech . 1245 He is courteous and
affable to all, but he does not gush forth indiscriminate praise . 125
He treats his inferiors without contempt, and his superiors without
seeking to court their favor . 128 He is grave in deport- ment, since
men will not take seriously one who is not serious with them; he is slow
in words and earnest in conduct; he is not quick with his tongue, or
given to clever repartee; he is earnest because he has work to do — and
this is the secret of his unaffected dignity . 127 He is courteous even
to his familiars, but maintains his reserve towards all, even his son .

<p>qualities of his “Higher Man”— so similar to th e Megalopsychos, or
“Great - Minded Man,” of Aristotle— in these words:</p>
<p>The Higher Man has nine things which are subjects with him of</p>
<p>thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes he is</p>
<p>anxious to see clearly. … In regard to his countenance he is
anxious</p>
<p>that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor he is anxious</p>
<p>that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech he is
anxious</p>
<p>that it should be sincere. In regard to his doing of business he
is</p>
<p>anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what
he</p>
<p>doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry</p>
<p>he thinks of the difficulties his anger may involve him in. When</p>
<p>he sees gain to be got he thinks of righteousness . 129</p>
<p>5 . Confucian Politics</p>
<p>Popular sovereignty — Government by example — The decentrali-</p>
<p>zation of wealth — Music and manners — Socialism</p>
<p>and revolution</p>
<p>None but such men, in the judgment of Confucius, could restore the
family and redeem the state. Society rests upon the obedience of the
children to their parents, and of the wife to her husband; when these
go, chaos comes . 130 Only one thing is higher than this law of
obedience, and that is the moral law. “In serving his parents (a son)
may remon - strate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not
incline to follow (his advice), he shows an increased degree of
reverence, but</p>
<p>does not abandon (his purpose) …. When the command is wrong, a son
should resist his father, and a minister should resist his August Master
.” 131 Here was one root of Mencius’ doctrine of the divine right of
revolution.</p>
<p>There was not much of the revolutionist in Confucius; perhaps he sus-
pected that the inheritors of a revolution are made of the same flesh as
the men whom it deposed. But he wrote bravely enough in the Book of
Odes: “Before the sovereigns of the Shang (Dynasty) had lost (the hearts
of) the people, they were the mates of God. Take warning from the house
of Shang. The great decree is not easily preserved .” 132 The people are
the actual and proper source of political sovereignty, for any govern-
ment that does not retain their confidence sooner or later falls.</p>
<p>Tsze- kung asked about government. The Master said, “(The</p>
<p>requisites of government) are three: that there should be suffi-</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>ciency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the confidence
of the people in their ruler.” Tsze - kung said, “If it cannot be</p>
<p>helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three
should be foregone first?” “The military equipment,” said the</p>
<p>Master. Tsze- kung asked again, “If it cannot be helped, and one
of</p>
<p>the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be
foregone?” The Master answered, “Part wit h the food. From of</p>
<p>old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people have no</p>
<p>faith (in their rulers) there is no standing (for the state ).”
133</p>
<p>The first principle of government, in the view of Confucius, is as
the</p>
<p>first principle of character-sincerity. Therefore the prime
instrument of government is good example: the ruler must be an eminence
of model behavior, from which, by prestige imitation, right conduct will
pour down upon his people.</p>
<p>Ke K’ang asked Confucius about government, saying, “What do</p>
<p>you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the
principled?”</p>
<p>Confucius replied, “Sir, in carrying on your government, why</p>
<p>should you use killing at all? Let your (evinced) desires be for</p>
<p>what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between</p>
<p>superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the
grass.</p>
<p>The grass must bend when the wind blows across it. . . . He who</p>
<p>exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to</p>
<p>the north polar star, which keeps its place, and all the stars
turn</p>
<p>toward it. . . . Ke K’ang asked how to cause the people to</p>
<p>reverence (their ruler), to be faithful to him, and to urge them-</p>
<p>selves to virtue. The Master said, “Let him preside over them</p>
<p>with gravity — then they will reverence him. Let him be filial
and</p>
<p>kind to all — then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance
the</p>
<p>good and teach the incompetent — then they will eagerly seek to</p>
<p>be virtuous .” 134</p>
<p>As good example is the first instrument of government, good appoint-
ments are the second. “Employ the upright and put aside the crooked: in
this way the crooked can be made to be upright .” 185 “The administra -
tion of government,” says the Doctrine of the Mean, “lies in (getting
proper) men. Such men are to be got by means of (the ruler’s) own</p>
<p>character .” 188 What would not a ministry of Higher Men do, even in
one generation, to cleanse the state and guide the people to a
loftier</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 673</p>
<p>level of civilization ? 137 First of all, they would avoid foreign
relations as much as possible, and seek to make their state so
independent of out- side supplies that it would never be tempted to war
for them. They</p>
<p>would reduce the luxury of courts, and seek a wide distribution of
wealth, for “the centralization of wealth is the way to scatter the
people, and letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the
people .” 138 They would decrease punishments, and increase public
instruction; for “there being instruction, there will be no distinction
of classes.” 13 ” The higher subjects would be forbidden to the
mediocre, but music would be taught to all. “When one has mastered music
completely, and regu - lates his heart and mind accordingly, the
natural, correct, gentle and sincere heart is easily developed, and joy
attends its development. . . . The best way to improve manners and
customs is to . . . pay attention to the composition of the music played
in the country.* . . . Manners and music should not for a moment be
neglected by any one. . . . Benevo- lence is akin to music, and
righteousness to good manners .” 110</p>
<p>Good manners, too, must be a care of the government, for when man-
ners decay the nation decays with them. Imperceptibly the rules of</p>
<p>propriety form at least the outward character , 111 and add to the
sage the graciousness of the gentleman; we become what we do.
Politically “the usages of propriety serve as dykes for the people
against evil excesses”; and “he who thinks the old embankments useless ,
and destroys them, is sure to suffer from the desolation caused by
overflowing water”: 113 one almost hears the stern voice of the angry
Master echoing those words today from that Hall of the Classics where
once all his words were en- graved in stone, and which revolution has
left desecrated and forlorn.</p>
<p>And yet Confucius too had his Utopias and dreams, and might have</p>
<p>sympathized at times with men who, convinced that the dynasty had
lost “the great decree” or “mandate of Heaven,” dragged down one system
of order in the hope of rearing a better one on the ruins. In the end he
became a socialist, and gave his fancy rein:</p>
<p>When the Great Principle (of the Great Similarity) prevails,</p>
<p>the whole world becomes a republic; they elect men of talents,</p>
<p>virtue and ability; they talk about sincere agreement, and
cultivate</p>
<p>universal peace. Thus men do not regard as their parents only
their</p>
<p>• “Let me write the songs of a nation,” said Daniel O’Connell, “and I
care not who</p>
<p>674 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>own parents, nor treat as their children only their own children.</p>
<p>A competent provision is secured for the aged till their death,
em-</p>
<p>ployment for the middle-aged, and the means of growing up for</p>
<p>the young. The widowers, widows, orphans, childless men, and</p>
<p>those who are disabled by disease, are all sufficiently
maintained.</p>
<p>Each man has his rights, and each woman her individuality safe-</p>
<p>guarded. They produce wealth, disliking that it should be thrown</p>
<p>away upon the ground, but not wishing to keep it for their own</p>
<p>gratification. Disliking idleness they labor, but not alone with a
view to their own advantage. In this way selfish schemings are repressed
and find no way to arise. Robbers, filchers and rebellious traitors</p>
<p>do not exist. Hence the outer doors remain open, and are not
shut.</p>
<p>This is the state of what I call the Great Similarity. 143</p>

<li>The Influence of Confucius</li>
</ol>
<p>The Confucian scholars — Their victory over the Legalists — De-</p>
<p>fects of Confucianism — The contemporaneity of Confucius</p>
<p>The success of Confucius was posthumous, but complete. His philos-
ophy had struck a practical and political note that endeared it to the
Chinese after death had removed the possibility of his insisting upon
its realization. Since men of letters never quite reconcile themselves
to being men of letters, the literati of the centuries after Confucius
attached them- selves sedulously to his doctrine as a road to influence
and public em- ployment, and created a class of Confucian scholars
destined to become the most powerful group in the empire. Schools sprang
up here and there for the teaching of the Master’s philosophy as handed
down by his disciples, developed by Mencius, and emended by a thousand
pundits in the course of time; and these schools, as the intellectual
centers of China, kept civilization alive during centuries of political
collapse, much as the monks preserved some measure of ancient culture,
and some degree of social order, during the Dark Ages that followed the
fall of Rome.</p>
<p>A rival school, the “Legalists,” disputed for a while this leadership
of Confucian thought in the political world, and occasionally moulded
the policy of the state. To make government depend upon the good ex-
ample of the governors and the inherent goodness of the governed, said
the Legalists, was to take a considerable risk; history had offered no
superabundance of precedents for the successful operation of these
ideal- istic principles. Not men but laws should rule, they argued; and
laws</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 675</p>
<p>must be enforced until, becoming a second nature to a society, they
are obeyed without force. The people are not intelligent enough to rule
themselves well; they prosper best under an aristocracy. Even tradesmen
are not too intelligent, but pursue their interests very often to the
detri- ment of the state; perhaps, said some of the Legalists, it would
be wiser for the state to socialize capital, monopolize trade, and
prevent the man- ipulation of prices and the concentration of wealth. 1
“ These were ideas that were destined to appear again and again in the
history of Chinese government.</p>
<p>In the long run the philosophy of Confucius triumphed. We shall see
later how the mighty Shih Huang-ti, with a Legalist for his prime
minister, sought to end the influence of Confucius by ordering that all
existing Confucian literature should be burned. But the power of the
word</p>
<p>proved stronger than that of the sword; the books which the
“First</p>
<p>Emperor” sought to destroy became holy and precious through his</p>
<p>enmity, and men died as martyrs in the effort to preserve them. When
Shih Huang-ti and his brief dynasty had passed away, a wiser emperor, Wu
Ti, brought the Confucian literature out of hiding, gave office to its
students, and strengthened the Han Dynasty by introducing the ideas and
methods of Confucius into the education of Chinese youth and</p>
<p>statesmanship. Sacrifices were decreed in honor of Confucius; the
texts of the Classics were by imperial command engraved on stone, and
became the official religion of the state. Rivaled at times by the
influence of</p>
<p>Taoism, and eclipsed for a while by Buddhism, Confucianism was re-
stored and exalted by the T’ang Dynasty, and the great T’ai Tsung</p>
<p>ordered that a temple should be erected to Confucius, and sacrifices
offered in it by scholars and officials, in every town and village of
the empire. During the Sung Dynasty a virile school of “Neo -
Confucians” arose, whose innumerable commentaries on the Classics spread
the phil- osophy of the Master, in varied dilutions, throughout the Far
East, and stimulated a philosophical development in Japan. From the rise
of the Han Dynasty to the fall of the Manchus — i.e., for two thousand
years — the doctrine of Confucius moulded and dominated the Chinese
mind.</p>
<p>The history of China might be written in terms of that influence. For
generation after generation the writings of the Master were the texts of
the official schools, and nearly every lad who came through those
schools had learned those texts by heart. The stoic conservatism of the
ancient sage sank almost into the blood of the people, and gave to the
nation, and</p>
<p>676 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>to its individuals, a dignity and profundity unequaled elsewhere in
the world or in history. With the help of this philosophy China
developed a harmonious community life, a zealous admiration for learning
and wis- dom, and a quiet and stable culture which made Chinese
civilization strong enough to survive every invasion, and to remould
every invader in its own image. Only in Christianity and in Buddhism can
we find again</p>
<p>so heroic an effort to transmute into decency the natural brutality
of men. And today, as then, no better medicine could be prescribed for
any people suffering from the disorder generated by an intellectualist
education, a decadent moral code, and a weakened fibre of individual and
national character, than the absorption of the Confucian philosophy by
the na- tion’s youth.</p>
<p>But that philosophy could not be a complete nourishment in itself. It
was well fitted to a nation struggling out of chaos and weakness into
order and strength, but it would prove a shackle upon a country com-
pelled by international competition to change and grow. The rules of
propriety, destined to form character and social order, became a strait-
jacket forcing almost every vital action into a prescribed and unaltered
mould. There was something prim and Puritan about Confucianism which
checked too thoroughly the natural and vigorous impulses of mankind; its
virtue was so complete as to bring sterility. No room was left in it for
pleasure and adventure, and little for friendship and love. It helped to
keep woman in supine debasement, 1 “ and its cold perfection froze the
nation into a conservatism as hostile to progress as it was favorable to
peace.</p>
<p>We must not blame all this upon Confucius; one cannot be expected to
do the thinking of twenty centuries. We ask of a thinker only that, as
the result of a lifetime of thought, he shall in some way illuminate our
path to understanding. Few men have done this more certainly than
Confucius. As we read him, and perceive how little of him must be</p>
<p>erased today because of the growth of knowledge and the change of
circumstance, how soundly he offers us guidance even in our contem-
porary world, we forget his platitudes and his unbearable perfection,
and join his pious grandson, K’ung Chi in that superlative eulogy which
be - gan the deification of Confucius:</p>
<p>Chung-ni (Confucius) handed down the doctrines of Yao and</p>
<p>Shun as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed
the</p>
<p>677</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>regulations of Wen and Wu, taking them as his model. Above he</p>
<p>harmonized with the times of heaven, and below he was conformed to
the water and land.</p>
<p>He may be compared to heaven and earth in their supporting and</p>
<p>containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He
may</p>
<p>be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to
the sun and moon in their successive shining. . . . ’</p>
<p>All-embracing and vast, he is like heaven. Deep and active as a</p>
<p>fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all
rev-</p>
<p>erence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts,
and</p>
<p>the people are all pleased with him.</p>
<p>Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends</p>
<p>to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach,
wher-</p>
<p>ever the strength of man penetrates, wherever the heavens over-</p>
<p>shadow and the earth sustains, wherever the sun and moon shine,</p>
<p>wherever frosts and dews fall — all who have blood and breath un-</p>
<p>feignedly honor and love him. Hence it is said: “He is the equal</p>
<p>of Heaven.” 14 *</p>

<li>SOCIALISTS AND ANARCHISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The two hundred years that followed upon Confucius were centuries of
lively controversy and raging heresy. Having discovered the pleasures of
philosophy, some men, like Hui Sze and Kung Sun Lung, played with logic,
and invented p aradoxes of reasoning as varied and subtle as Zeno’s. 14
’ Philosophers flocked to the city of Lo-yang as, in the same centuries,
they were flocking to Benares and Athens; and they enjoyed in the
Chinese capital all that freedom of speech and thought which made Athens
the intellectual center of the Mediterranean world. Sophists called
Tsung- heng- kia, or “Crisscross Philosophers,” crowded the capital to
teach all and sundry the art of persuading any man to anything. 148 To
Lo-yang came Mencius, inheritor of the mantle of Confucius, Chuang-tze,
greatest of Lao- tze’s followers, Hsiin -tze, the apostle of original
evil, and Mo Ti, the prophet of universal love.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mo Ti, Altruist</li>
</ol>
<p>An early logician — Christian — and pacifist</p>
<p>“Mo Ti,” said his enemy, Mencius, “loved all men, and would
gladly</p>
<p>wear out his whole being from head to heel for the benefit of
mankind. 148</p>
<p>678 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>He was a native of Lu, like Confucius, and flourished shortly after
the passing of the s age. He condemned the impracticality of
Confucius’</p>
<p>thought, and offered to replace it by exhorting all men to love one
an- other. He was among the earliest of Chinese logicians, and the worst
of Chinese reasoners. He stated the problem of logic with great
simplicity:</p>
<p>These are what I call the Three Laws of Reasoning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Where to find the foundation. Find it in the study of the</li>
</ol>
<p>experiences of the wisest men of the past.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>How to take a general survey of it? Examine the facts of the</li>
</ol>
<p>actual experience of the people.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>How to apply it? Put it into law and governmental policy,</li>
</ol>
<p>and see whether or not it is conducive to the welfare of the
state</p>
<p>and the people. 1 ™</p>
<p>On this basis Mo Ti proceeded to prove that ghosts and spirits are
real, for many people have seen them. He objected strongly to Confucius’
coldly impersonal view of heaven, and argued for the personality of God.
Like Pascal, he thought religion a good wager: if the ancestors to whom
we sacrifice hear us, we have made a good bargain; if they are quite
dead, and unconscious of our offerings, the sacrifice gives us an
opportunity to “gather our relatives and neighbors and participate in
the enjoyment of the sacrificial victuals and drinks.” 101</p>
<p>In the same manner, reasons Mo Ti, universal love is the only
solution of the social problem; for if it were applied there is no doubt
that it would bring Utopia. “Men in general loving one another, the
strong would not make prey of the weak, the many would not plunder the
few, the rich would not insult the poor, the noble would not be insolent
to the mean, and the deceitful would not impose upon the simple.” 103
Selfishness is the source of all evil, from the acquisitiveness of the
child to the conquest of an empire. Mo Ti marvels that a man who steals
a pig is universally con- demned and generally punished, while a man who
invades and appropriates a kingdom is a hero to his people and a model
to posterity. 105 From this pacifism Mo Ti advanced to such vigorous
criticism of the state that his doctrine verged on anarchism, and
frightened the authorities. 104 Once, his biographers assure us, when
the State Engineer of the Kingdom of Chu was 1 about to invade the state
of Sung in order to test a new siege ladder which he had invented, Mo Ti
dissuaded him by preaching to him his doctrine of universal love and
peace. “Before I met you,” said the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 679</p>
<p>Engineer, “I had wanted to conquer the state of Sung. But since I
have seen you I would not have it even if it were given to me without
resist- ance but with no just cause.” “If so,” replied Mo Ti, “it is as
if I had</p>
<p>already given you the state of Sung. Do persist in your righteous
course, and I will give you the whole world .” 155</p>
<p>The Confucian scholars, as well as the politicians of Lo-yang, met
these amiable proposals with laughter . 155 Nevertheless Mo Ti had his
followers, and for two centuries his views became the religion of a
pacifistic sect. Two of his disciples, Sung Ping and Kung Sun Lung,
waged active cam- paigns for disarmament . 157 Han Fei, the greatest
critic of his age, attacked the movement from what we might call a
Nietzchean standpoint, arguing that until men had actually sprouted the
wings of universal love, war would continue to be the arbiter of
nations. When Shih Huang-ti ordered his famous “burning of the books,”
the literature of Mohism was cast into the flames along with the volumes
of Confucius; and unlike the writings and doctrines of the Master, the
new religion did not survive the con- flagration . 158</p>

<li>Yang Chu, Egoist</li>
</ol>
<p>An epicurean determinist — The case for wickedness</p>
<p>Meanwhile a precisely opposite doctrine had found vigorous expression
among the Chinese. Yang Chu, of whom we know nothing except through the
mouths of his enemies , 158 announced paradoxically that life is full of
suffering, and that its chief purpose is pleasure. There is no god, said
Yang, and no after-life; men are the helpless puppets of the blind
natural forces that made them, and that gave them their unchosen
ancestry and their inalienable character . 180 The wise man will accept
this fate without complaint, but will not be fooled by all the nonsense
of Confucius and Mo Ti about inherent virtue, universal love, and a good
name: morality is a deception practised upon the simple by the clever;
universal love is the delusion of children who do not know the universal
enmity that forms the law of life; and a good name is a posthumous
bauble which the fools who paid so dearly for it cannot enjoy. In life
the good suffer like the bad, and the wicked seem to enjoy themselves
more keenly than the good . 191 The wisest men of antiquity were not
moralists and rulers, as Confucius supposed, but sensible sensualists
who had the good fortune to antedate the legislators and the
philosophers, and who enjoyed the pleasures of every impulse. It is true
that the wicked sometimes leave a bad name</p>

<p>behind them, but this is a matter that does not disturb their bones.
Con- sider, says Yang Chu, the fate of the good and the evil:</p>
<p>All agree in considering Shun, Yu, Chou-kung and Confucius to</p>
<p>have been the most admirable of men, and Chieh and Chou the most
wicked.*</p>
<p>Now Shun had to plough the ground on the south of the Ho,</p>
<p>and to play the potter by the Lei lake. His four limbs had not</p>
<p>even a temporary rest; for his mouth and belly he could not even</p>
<p>find pleasant food and warm clothing. No love of his parents</p>
<p>rested upon him; no affection of his brothers and sisters. . . .
When</p>
<p>Yao at length resigned to him the throne, he was advanced in age;</p>
<p>his wisdom was decayed; his son Shang-chun proved without ability;
and he had finally to resign the throne to Yu. Sorrowfully came</p>
<p>he to his death. Of all mortals never was one whose life was so</p>
<p>worn out and empoisoned as his. . . .</p>
<p>All the energies of Yu were spent on his labors with the land;</p>
<p>a child was bom to him, but he could not foster it; he passed his</p>
<p>door without entering; his body became bent and withered; the skin of
his hands and feet became thick and callous. When at length</p>
<p>Shun resigned to him the throne, he lived in a low mean house,</p>
<p>though his sacrificial apron and cap were elegant. Sorrowfully</p>
<p>came he to his death. Of all mortals never was one whose life was</p>
<p>so saddened and embittered as his. . . .</p>
<p>Confucius understood the ways of the ancient sovereigns and</p>
<p>kings. He responded to the invitations of the princes of his
time.</p>
<p>The tree was cut down over him in Sung; the traces of his foot-</p>
<p>steps were removed in Wei; he was reduced to extremity in Shang</p>
<p>and Chou; he was surrounded in Ch’an and Ts’i; … he was dis -</p>
<p>graced by Yang Hu. Sorrowfully came he to his death. Of all</p>
<p>mortals never was one whose life was so agitated and hurried as</p>
<p>his.</p>
<p>These four sages, during their lives, had not a single day’s joy.</p>
<p>Since their death they have had a fame that will last through myriads
of ages. But that fame is what no one who cares for what is real</p>
<p>would chose. Celebrate them — they do not know it. Reward</p>
<p>them — they do not know it. Their fame is no more to them than</p>

<p>many generations; to him belonged the honor of the royal seat;</p>
<p>his wisdom was enough to enable him to set at defiance all below;</p>
<p>his power was enough to shake the world. He indulged the pleas-</p>

<p>Of all mortals never was one whose life was so luxurious and</p>
<p>dissipated as his. Chou (Hsin) came into the accumulated wealth</p>
<p>of many generations; to him belonged the honor of the royal seat;</p>
<p>his power enabled him to do whatever he would; … he indulged</p>
<p>his feelings in all his palaces; he gave the reins to his lusts
through</p>
<p>the long night; he never made himself bitter by the thought of</p>
<p>propriety and righteousness. Brightly came he to his destruction.</p>
<p>Of all mortals never was one whose life was as abandoned as his.</p>
<p>These two villains, during their lives, had the joy of gratifying</p>
<p>their desires. Since their death, they have had the (evil) fame
of</p>
<p>folly and tyranny. But the reality (of enjoyment) is what no fame</p>
<p>can give. Reproach them — they do not know it. Praise them — they</p>
<p>do not know it. Their (ill) fame is no more to them than the</p>
<p>trunk of a tree, or a clod of earth. 18 *</p>
<p>How different all this is from Confucius! Again we suspect that time,
who is a reactionary, has preserved for us the most respectable of
Chinese thinkers, and has swallowed nearly all the rest in the limbo of
forgotten souls. And perhaps time is right: humanity itself could not
long survive if many were of Yan Chu’s mind. The only answer to him is
that society cannot exist if the individual does not cooperate with his
followers in the give and take, the bear and forbear, of moral
restraints; and the developed individual cannot exist without society;
our life depends upon those very limitations that constrain us. Some
historians have found in the spread of such egoist philosophies part
cause of that disintegration which marked Chinese society in the fourth
and third centuries before Christ . 108 No wonder that Mencius, the
Dr. Johnson of his age, raised his voice in</p>
<p>scandalized protest against the epicureanism of Yang Chu, as well as
against the idealism of Mo Ti.</p>

</ol>
<p>A model mother — A philosopher among kings — Are men by</p>
<p>nature good? — Single tax — Mencius and the communists</p>
<p>— The profit-motive — The right of revolution</p>
<p>Mencius, destined to be second in fame to Confucius alone in the rich
annals of Chinese philosophy, belonged to the ancient family of Mang;
his name Mang Ko was changed by an imperial decree to Mang-tze — i.e.,
Mang the Master or Philosopher; and the Latin-trained scholafs of Europe
trans- formed him into Men cius, as they had changed K’ung -fu-tze into
Con- fucius.</p>
<p>We know the mother of Mencius almost as intimately as we know</p>
<p>him; for Chinese historians, who have made her famous as a model of
maternity, recount many pretty stories of her. Thrice, we are told, she
changed her residence on his account: once because they lived near a
cemetery, and the boy began to behave like an undertaker; another time
because they lived near a slaughterhouse, and the boy imitated too well
the cries of the slain animals; and again because they lived near a
market place, and the boy began to act the part of a tradesman; finally
she found a home near a school, and was satisfied. When the boy
neglected his studies she cut through, in his presence, the thread of
her shuttle; and when he asked why she did so destructive a thing, she
explained that she was but imitating his own negligence, and the lack of
continuity in his studies and his development. He became an assiduous
student, married, resisted the temptation to divorce his wife, opened a
school of philosophy, gathered a famous collection of students about
him, and received invita- tions from various princes to come and discuss
with them his theories of government. He hesitated to leave his mother
in her old age, but she sent</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 683</p>
<p>him off with a speech that endeared her to all Chinese males, and may
have been composed by one of them.</p>
<p>It does not belong to a woman to determine anything of herself,</p>
<p>but she is subject to the rule of the three obediences. When
young</p>
<p>she has to obey her parents; when married she has to obey her</p>
<p>husband; when a widow she has to obey her son. You are a man in</p>
<p>your full maturity, and I am old. Do you act as your conviction
of</p>
<p>righteousness tells you you ought to do, and I will act according
to</p>
<p>the rule which belongs to me. Why should you be anxious about</p>
<p>me ? 185</p>
<p>He went, for the itch to teach is a part of the itch to rule; scratch
the one and find the other. Like Voltaire, Mencius preferred monarchy to
democracy, on the ground that in democracy it is necessary to educate
all if the government is to succeed, while under monarchy it is only re-
quired that the philosopher should bring one man — the king — to wisdom,
in order to produ ce the perfect state. “Correct what is wrong in
the</p>
<p>prince’s mind. Once rectify the prince, and the kingdom will be
settled .” 108 He went first to Ch’i, and tried to rectify its Prince
Hsuan; he accepted an honorary office, but refused the salary that went
with it; and soon finding that the Prince was not interested in
philosophy, he withdrew to the small principality of T’ang, whose ruler
became a sincere but in - effectual pupil. Mencius returned to Ch’i, and
proved his growth in</p>
<p>wisdom and understanding by accepting a lucrative office from Prince
Hsuan. When, during these comfortable years, his mother died, he buried
her with such pomp that his pupils were scandalized; he explained to
them that it was only a sign of his filial devotion. Some years later
Hsuan set out upon a war of conquest, and, resenting Mencius’ untimely
pacifism, terminated his employment. Hearing that the Prince of Sung had
ex- pressed his intention of ruling like a philosopher, Mencius
journeyed to his court, but found that the report had been exaggerated.
Like the men invited to an ancient wedding-feast, the various princes
had many excuses for not being rectified. “I have an infirmity,” said
one of them; “I love valor.” “I have an infirmity,” said another; “I am
fond of wealth.” 1 ”</p>
<p>Mencius retired from public life, and gave his declining years to the
in- struction of students and the composition of a work in which he de-
scribed his conversations with the royalty of his time. We cannot tell
to what extent these should be classed with those of Walter Savage
Landor;</p>
<p>684 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>nor do we know whether this composition was the work of Mencius him-
self, or of his pupils, or of neither, or of both. 1 ” We can only say
that the</p>
<p>His doctrine is as severely secular as that of Confucius. There is
little here about logic, or epistemology, or metaphysics; the Confucians
left such subtleties to the followers of Lao-tze, and confined
themselves to moral and political speculation. What interests Mencius is
the charting of the good life, and the establishment of government by
good men. His basic claim is that men are by nature good, 1 “ and that
the social problem arises not out of the nature of men but out of the
wickedness of govern- ments. Hence philosophers must become kings, or
the kings of this world must become philosophers.</p>
<p>“Now, if your Majesty will institute a government whose action</p>
<p>will be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the
kingdom</p>
<p>to wish to stand in your Majesty’s court, and all the farmers to</p>
<p>wish to plough in your Majesty’s fields, and all the merchants to</p>
<p>wish to store their goods in your Majesty’s market -places, and
all</p>
<p>traveling strangers to wish to make their tours on your Majesty’s</p>
<p>roads, and all throughout the Kingdom who feel aggrieved by</p>
<p>their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. And</p>
<p>when they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?”</p>
<p>The King said, “I am stupid, and not able to advance to this.” 1
™</p>
<p>The good ruler would war not against other countries, but against the
common enemy — poverty, for it is out of poverty and ignorance that
crime and disorder come. To punish men for crimes committed as the
result of a lack of opportunities offered them for employment is a
dastardly trap to set for the people. 1 ” A government is responsible
for the welfare</p>
<p>We perceive how old are the political problems, attitudes and
solutions of our enlightened age when we learn that Mencius was rejected
by the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIll) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 685</p>
<p>princes for his radicalism, and was scorned for his conservatism by
the socialists and communists of his time. When the “shrike -tongued
bar- b arian of the south,” Hsu Hsing, raised the flag of the
proletarian dictator - ship, demanding that workingmen should be made
the heads of the state (“The magistrates,” said Hsu, “should be laboring
men”), and many of “The Learned,” then as now, flocked t o the new
standard, Mencius re- jected the idea scornfully, and argued that
government should be in the hands of educated men.” 1 ™ But he denounced
the profit -motive in human society, and rebuked Sung K’ang for
proposing to win the kings to</p>
<p>pacifism by persuading them, in modern style, of the unprofitableness
of war.</p>
<p>Your aim is great, but your argument is not good. If you,
starting</p>
<p>from the point of profit, offer your persuasive counsels to the
kings</p>
<p>of Ch’in and Ch’i, and if those kings are plea sed with the
consid-</p>
<p>eration of profit so as to stop the movements of their armies,</p>
<p>then all belonging to those armies will rejoice in the cessation
(of</p>
<p>war), and will find their pleasures in (the pursuit of) profit.
Min-</p>
<p>isters will serve the sovereign for the profit of which they
cherish</p>
<p>the thought; sons will serve their fathers, and younger brothers will
serve their elder brothers, from the same consideration; and the is- sue
will be that, abandoning benevolence and righteousness, sovereign and
minister, father and son, younger brother and elder, will carry</p>
<p>on all their intercourse with this thought of profit cherished in
their</p>
<p>breasts. But never has there been such a state (of society),
with-</p>
<p>out ruin being the result of it. 1 ”</p>
<p>He recognized the right of revolution, and preached it in the face of
kings. He denounced war as a crime, and shocked the hero-worshipers of
his time by writing: “There are men who say: ‘I am skilful at marshal -
ing troops, I am skilful at conducting a battle.’ They are great
criminals.” 1 ™ “There has never been a good war,” he said. 1 ™ He
condemned the luxury of the courts, and sternly rebuked the king who fed
his dogs and swine while famine was consuming his people. 1 “ When a
king argued that he could not prevent famine, Mencius told him that he
should resign. 1 “ “The people,” he taught, “are the most important
element (in a nation); . . . the sovereign is the lighest”; 1 “ and the
people have the right o depose their rulers, even, now and then, to kill
them.</p>
<p>The King Hsuan asked about the high ministers. . . . Mencius</p>
<p>answered: “If the princes have great faults, they ought to remon
-</p>
<p>(586 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>strate with him; and if he do not listen to them after they have done
so again and again, they ought to dethrone him.” . . . Mencius pro -</p>
<p>ceeded: “Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not regulate</p>
<p>the officers (under him), how would you deal with him?” The</p>
<p>King said, “Dismiss him.” Mencius again said: “If withi n the
four</p>
<p>borders (of your kingdom) there is not good government, what is</p>
<p>to be done?” The King looked to the right and left, and spoke of</p>
<p>other matters. . . . The King Hsuan asked, “Was it so that T’ang</p>
<p>banished Chieh, and that King Wu smote Chou (Hs in)?” Mencius</p>
<p>replied, “It is so in the records.” The King said, “May a
minister</p>
<p>put his sovereign to death?” Mencius said: “He who outrages the</p>
<p>benevolence (proper to his nature) is called a robber; he who
out-</p>
<p>rages righteousness is called a ruffian. The robber and the
ruffian</p>
<p>we call a mere fellow. I have heard of the cutting off of the
fel-</p>
<p>low Chou, but I have not heard of putting a sovereign to death .”
183</p>
<p>It was brave doctrine, and had much to do with the establishment of
the principle, recognized by the kings as well as the people of China,
that a ruler who arouses the enmity of his people has lost the “mandate
of Heaven,” and may be removed. It is not to be marveled at that Hung
-wu, founder of the Ming Dynasty, having read with great indignation the
conversations of Mencius with King Hsuan, ordered Mencius to be de-
graded from his place in the temple of Confucius, where a royal edict of
1084 had erected his tablet. But within a year the tablet was restored;
and until the Revolution of 1911 Mencius remained one of the heroes of
China, the second great name and influence in the history of Chinese
orthodox philosophy. To him and to Chu Hsi* Confucius owed his in-
tellectual leadership of China for more than two thousand years.</p>

</ol>
<p>The evil nature of man — The necessity of law</p>
<p>There were many weaknesses in Mencius’ philosophy, and his contem -
poraries exposed them with a fierce delight. Was it true that men were
by nature good, and were led to evil only by wicked institutions? — or
was human nature itself responsible for the ills of society? Here was an
early formulation of a conflict that has raged for some eons between re-
formers and conservatives. Does education diminish crime, increase
virtue,</p>
<p>Cf. p. 731 below.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 687</p>
<p>and lead men into Utopia? Are philosophers fit to govern states, or
do their theories worse confound the confusion which they seek to
cure?</p>
<p>The ablest and most hardheaded of Mencius’ critics w as a public
official who seems to have died at the age of seventy about the year 235
b.c. As Mencius had believed human nature to be good in all men, so
Hsiin-tze believed it to be bad in all men; even Shun and Yao were
savages at birth. 184 Hsiin, in the fragment that remains of him, writes
like another Hobbes:</p>
<p>The nature of man is evil; the good which it shows is
factitious.*</p>
<p>There belongs to it, even at his birth, the love of gain; and as
ac-</p>
<p>tions are in accordance with this, contentions and robberies grow</p>
<p>up, and self-denial and yielding to others are not to be found
(by</p>
<p>nature); there belong to it envy and dislike, and as actions are
in</p>
<p>accordance with these, violence and injuries spring up, and self-</p>
<p>devotedness and faith are not to be found; there belong to it the de-
sires of the ears and the eyes, leading to the love of sounds and</p>
<p>beauty, and as the actions are in accordance with these, lewdness</p>
<p>and disorder spring up, and righteousness and propriety, with
their</p>
<p>various orderly displays, are not to be found. It thus appears
that</p>
<p>to follow man’s nature and yield obedience to its feelings will as
-</p>
<p>suredly conduct to contentions and robberies, to the violation of</p>
<p>the duties belonging to every one’s lot, and the confounding of
all</p>
<p>distinctions, till the issue will be a state of savagery; and that
there</p>
<p>must be the influence of teachers and laws, and the guidance of pro-
priety and righteousness, from which will spring self-denial, yielding
to others, and an observance of the well-ordered regulations of con-
duct, till the issue will be a state of good government. . . . The</p>
<p>sage kings of antiquity, understanding that the nature of man was</p>
<p>thus evil, … set up the principles of righteousness and
propriety,</p>
<p>and framed laws and regulations to straighten and ornament the</p>
<p>feelings of that nature and correct them, … so that they might
all</p>
<p>go forth in the way of moral government and in agreement with</p>
<p>reason. 185</p>
<p>Hsiin-tze concluded, like Turgeniev, that nature is not a temple but
a workshop; she provides the raw material, but intelligence must do the
rest. By proper training, he thought, these naturally evil men might be
transformed even into saints, if that should be desirable. 188 Being
also a poet, he put Francis Bacon into doggerel:</p>
<h1

<p>The “return to Nature,” however, co uld not be so readily
discouraged; it found voice in this age as in every other, and by what
might be called a natural accident its exponent was the most eloquent
writer of his time. Chuang-tze, loving Nature as the only mistress who
always welcomed him, whatever his infidelities or his age, poured into
his philosophy the poetic sensitivity of a Rousseau, and yet sharpened
it with the satiric wit of a Voltaire. Who could imagine Mencius so far
forgetting himself as to describe a man as having “a large goitre like
an earthenware jar?”” 8 Chuang belongs to literature as well as to
philosophy.</p>
<p>He was bom in the province of Sung, and held minor office for a time
in the city of Khi-yiian. He visited the same courts as Mencius, but</p>
<p>neither, in his exta nt writings, mentions the other’s name; perhaps
they loved each other like contemporaries. Story has it that he refused
high office twice. When the Duke ofi Wei offered him the prime ministry
he dismissed the royal messengers with a curtness indicative of a
writer’s dreams: “Go away quickly, and do not soil me with your
presence. I</p>
<p>had rather amuse and enjoy myself in a filthy ditch than be subject
to the rules and restrictions in the court of a sovereign.” 180 While he
was fishing two great officers brought him a message from the King of
Khu: “I wish to trouble you with the charge of all my territories.”
Chuang,</p>
<p>Chuang tells us, answered without turning away from his fishing:</p>
<p>“I have heard that in Khu there is a spirit -like tortoise-shell,
the</p>
<p>wearer of which died three thousand years ago, and which the</p>
<p>68 9</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS</p>
<p>king keeps, in his ancestral temple, in a hamper covered with a</p>
<p>cloth. Was it better for the tortoise to die and leave its shell
to</p>
<p>be thus honored? Or would it have been better for it to live, and</p>
<p>keep on dragging its tail after it over the mud?” The two
officers</p>
<p>said, “It would have been better for it to live, and draw its tail
after</p>
<p>it over the mud.” “Go your ways,” said Chuang; “I will keep on</p>
<p>drawing my tail after me through the mud.” 1 ”</p>
<p>His respect for governments equaled that of his spiritual
ancestor,</p>
<p>Lao-tze. He took delight in pointing out how many qualities kings and
governors shared with thieves . 191 If, by some negligence on his part,
a true philosopher should find himself in charge of a state, his proper
course would be to do nothing, and allow men in freedom to build their
own organs of self- government. “I have heard of letting the world be,
and exercising forbearan ce; I have not heard of governing the world .”
191 The Golden Age, which preceded the earliest kings, had no
government; and Yao and Shun, instead of being so honored by China and
Confucius,</p>
<p>should be charged with having destroyed the primitive happiness of
man- kind by introducing government. “In the age of perfect virtue men
lived in common with birds and beasts, and were on terms of equality
with all creatures, as forming one family: how could they know among
them- selves the distinctions of super ior men and small men?” 1 ”</p>
<p>The wise man, thinks Chuang, will take to his heels at the first sign
of government, and will live as far as possible from both philosophers
and kings. He will court the peace and silence of the woods (here was
a</p>
<p>theme that a thousand Chinese painters would seek to illustrate), and
let his whole being, without any impediment of artifice or thought,
follow the divine Tao — the law and flow of Nature’s inexplicable life.
He would be sparing of words, for words mislead as often as they guide,
and the Tao — the Way and the Essence of Nature — can never be phrased
in words or formed in thought; it can only be felt by the blood. He
would reject the aid of machinery, preferring the older, more burdensome
ways of simpler men; for machinery makes complexity, turbulence and
inequality, and no man can live among machines and achieve peace. 19 *
He would avoid the ownership of property, and would find no use in his
life for gold; like Timon he would let the gold lie hidden in the hills,
and the pearls remain unsought in the deep. “His distinction is in
understanding that all things belong to the one treasury, and that death
and life should be</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>690</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>viewed in the same way” 105 — as harmonious measures in the rhythm of
Nature, waves of one sea.</p>
<p>The center of Chuang’s thought, as of the thought of that half
-legendary Lao-tze who seemed to him so much profounder than Confucius,
was a mystic vision of an impersonal unity, so strangely akin to the
doctrines of Buddha and the Upanishads that one is tempted to believe
that Indian metaphysics had found its way into China long before the
recorded com- ing of Buddhism four hundred years later. It is true that
Chuang is an agnostic, a fatalist, a determinist and a pessimist; but
this does not prevent him from being a kind of sceptical saint, a
T^o-intoxicated man. He</p>
<p>expresses his scepticism characteristically in a story:</p>
<p>The Penumbra said to the Umbra: * “At one moment you move,</p>
<p>at another you are at rest. At one moment you sit down, at another
you get up. Why this instability of purpose?” “I depend,” replied
the</p>
<p>Umbra, “upon something which causes me to do as I do; and that</p>
<p>something depends upon something else which causes it to do as it</p>
<p>does. . . . How can I tell why I do one thing or do not do an-</p>
<p>other?” . . . When the body is decomposed, the mind will be de -</p>
<p>composed along with it; must not the case be pronounced very</p>
<p>deplorable? . . . The change — the rise and dissolution — of all
things (continually) goes on, but we do not know who it is that
main-</p>
<p>tains and continues the process. How do we know when any one</p>
<p>begins? How do we know when he will end? We have simply to</p>
<p>wait for it, and nothing more . 108</p>
<p>These problems, Chuang suspects, are due less to the nature of things
than to the limits of our thought; it is not to be wondered at that the
effort of our imprisoned brains to understand the cosmos of which they
are such minute particles should end in contradic tions, “antinomies,”
and befuddlement. This attempt to explain the whole in terms of the part
has been a gigantic immodesty, forgivable only on the ground of the
amuse- ment which it has caused; for humor, like philosophy, is a view
of the part in terms of the whole, and neither is possible without the
other. The intellect, says Chuang-tze, can never avail to understand
ultimate things, or any profound thing, such as the growth of a child.
“Disputation is a proof of not seeing clearly,” and in order to
understand the Tao , one “must</p>

<p>sternly suppress one’s knowledge ”; 107 we have to forget our
theories and feel the fact. Education is of no help towards such
understanding; sub- mersion in the flow of nature is all-important.</p>
<p>What is the Tao that the rare and favored mystic sees? It is
inexpressible in words; weakly and with contradictions we describe it as
the unity of all things, their quiet flow from origin to fulfilment, and
the law that gov- erns that flow. “Before th ere were heaven and earth,
from of old it was, securely existing .” 108 In that cosmic unity all
contradictions are resolved, all distinctions fade, all opposites meet;
within it and from its standpoint there is no good or bad, no white or
black, no beautiful or ugly,* no great or small. “If one only knows that
the universe is but (as small as) a tare is permanent, and none so
unique that it cannot pass into another in the leisurely cycle of
evolution.</p>
<p>The seeds (of things) are multitudinous and minute. On the sur-</p>
<p>face of the water they form a membranous texture. When they reach to
where the land and water join they become the (lichens that</p>
<p>form the) clothes of frogs and oysters. Coming to life on mounds</p>
<p>and heights, they become the plantain; and receiving manure, ap-</p>
<p>pear as crows’ feet. The roots of the crow’s foot become grubs,</p>
<p>and its leaves, butterflies. This butterfly is changed into an
insect,</p>
<p>and comes to life under a furnace. Then it has the form of a
moth.</p>
<p>The mother after a thousand days becomes a bird. . . . The ying -</p>
<p>hsi uniting with a bamboo produces the khing-ning; this, the pan-</p>
<p>ther; the panthe’r, the horse; and the horse the man. Man then
en-</p>
<p>ters into the great Machinery (of Evolution), from which all
things</p>
<p>come forth, and which they enter at death . 201</p>
<p>It is not as clear as Darwin, but it will serve.</p>
<p>In this endless cycle man himself may pass into other forms; his
present shape is transient, and from the viewpoint of eternity may be
only super- ficially real — part of Maya’s deceptive veil of
difference.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I, Chuang-tze, dreamt I was a butterfly, flut-</p>
<p>tering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a
butterfly.</p>
<p>I was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and
was</p>

<p>unconscious of my individuality as a man. Suddenly I awoke, and</p>
<p>there I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then</p>
<p>a man dreaming that I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a</p>
<p>butterfly dreaming that I am a man. 203</p>
<p>Death is therefore only a change of form, possibly for the better; it
is, as Ibsen was to say, the great Button-Moulder who fuses us again in
the furnace of change:</p>
<p>Tze Lai fell ill and lay gasping at the point of death, while his</p>
<p>wife and children stood around him weeping. Li went to ask for</p>
<p>him, and said to them: “Hush! Get out of the way! Do not disturb</p>
<p>him in his process of transformation.” . . . Then, leaning against
the</p>
<p>door, he spoke to (the dyi ng man). Tze Lai said: “A man’s rela -</p>
<p>tions with the Yin and the Yang is more than that to his parents.</p>
<p>If they are hastening my death, and I do not obey, I shall be
con-</p>
<p>sidered unruly. There is the Great Mass (of Nature), that makes</p>
<p>me carry this body, labor with this life, relax in old age, and
rest</p>
<p>in death. Therefore that which has taken care of my birth is that</p>
<p>which will take care of my death. Here is a great founder cast-</p>
<p>ing his metal. If the metal, dancing up and down, should say, 1</p>
<p>must be made into a Mo Yeh’ (a famous old sword), the great</p>
<p>founder would surely consider this metal an evil one. So, if,

<p>because one has once assumed the human form, one insists on being a
man, and a man only, the author of transformation will be sure to
consider this one an evil being. Let us now regard heaven and</p>
<p>earth as a great melting-pot, and the author of transformation as
a</p>
<p>great founder; and wherever we go, shall we not be at home?</p>
<p>Quiet is our sleep, and calm is our awakening.” 208</p>
<p>When Chuang himself was about to die his disciples prepared for him a
ceremonious funeral. But he bade them desist. “With heaven and earth for
my coffin and shell, with the sun, moon and stars as my burial regalia,
and with all creation to escort me to the grave — are not my funeral
para- phernalia ready to hand?” The disciples protested that, unburied,
he would be eaten by the carrion birds of the air. To which Chuang</p>
<p>answered, with the smiling irony of all his words: “Above ground I
shall be food for kites; below I shall be food for mole-crickets and
ants. Why rob one to feed the other ?” 204</p>
<p>If we have spoken at such length of the ancient philosophers of China
it is partly because the insoluble problems of human life and
destiny</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) THE AGE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS 693</p>
<p>irresistibly attract the inquisitive mind, and partly because the
lore of her philosophers is the most precious portion of China’s gift to
the world. Long ago (in 1697) the cosmic-minded Leibnitz, after studying
Chinese philosophy, appealed for the mingling and cross-fertilization of
East and West. “The condition of affairs among ourselves,” he wrote, in
terms which have been useful to every generation, “is such that in view
of the inordinate lengths to which the corruption of morals has
advanced, I almost think it necessary that Chinese missionaries should
be sent to us to teach us the aim and practice of national theology. …
For I believe that if a wise man were to be appointed judge … of the
goodness of’ peopl es, he would award the golden apple to the Chinese.”
2 ” He begged Peter the Great to build a land route to China, and he
promoted the foundation of societies in Moscow and Berlin for the
“opening up of</p>
<p>China and the interchange of civilizations between China and Europe.”
20 * In 1721 Christian Wolff made an attempt in this direction by
lecturing at Halle “On the Practical Philosophy of the Chinese.” He was
accused of atheism, and dismissed; but when Frederick mounted the throne
he called him to Prussia, and restored him to honor. 201</p>
<p>The Enlightenment took up Chinese philosophy at the same time that it
carved out Chinese gardens and adorned its homes with chinoiseries. The
Physiocrats seem to have been influenced by Lao-tze and Chuang-tze in
their doctrine of laissez-faire ;** and Rousseau at times talked so like
the Old Master* that we at once correlate him with Lao-tze and Chuang,
as we should correlate Voltaire with Confucius and Mencius, if these had
been blessed with wit. “I have read the books of Confucius with atten-
tion,” said Voltaire; “I have made extracts from them; I have found in
them nothing but the purest morality, without the slightest tinge of
charlatanism.”™ Goethe in 1770 recorded his resolution to read the philo
- sophical classics of China; and when the guns of half the world
resounded at Leipzig forty-three years later, the old sage paid no
attention to them, being absorbed in Chinese literature.™</p>
<p>May this brief and superficial introduction lead the reader on to
study the Chinese philosophers themselves, as Goethe studied them, and
Vol- taire, and Tolstoi.</p>
