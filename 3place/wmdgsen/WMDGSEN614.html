<h4 id="chapter-xix-english-philosophy">CHAPTER XIX English
Philosophy</h4>
<p>S CIENCE in the Britain of 1789-1815 had little influence on
philosophy.</p>
<p>“Natural philosophy”— i.e., the physical sciences — could be
reconciled with a liberal theology, and even the idea of evolution could
be domesticated by interpreting the six “days” of Creation as elastic
aeons of development. The upper classes, now that their flirtation with
Voltaire and the Encyclo- pedists had been ended by the Revolution, had
come to distrust ideas as an infectious disease of youth; they
considered weekly worship a wise invest- ment in social order and
political stability, and they complained that Prime Minister Pitt found
no time to go to church. There were some privately skeptical bishops,
but they were known for their public piety. Nevertheless, the old
conflict continued. In the same year 1794 two opposite voices pro-
claimed it: Thomas Paine in The Age of Reason, and William Paley in A
View of the Evidences of Christianity. A glance at both of them will
sug- gest the temper of the time.</p>
<p>I. TOM PAINE ON CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>“Tom” Paine, as two continents came to call him, was an Englishman,
born to a Quaker family at Thetford, Norfolk, in 1737; but, on the
advice of Benjamin Franklin, he emigrated to America in 1774, and took
an active part in the American Revolution. General Washington credited
Paine’s booklet Common Sense (January, 1776) , with having “worked a
powerful change in the minds of many men.” 1 During the Revolutionary
War, as an aide-de-camp to General Nathanael Greene, he issued a series
of tracts — The Crisis — to keep up the spirit of the rebel army and
citizenry; one of these began with a famous line — “These are the times
that try men’s souls.” From 1787 to 1802 he lived chiefly in Europe,
working for the French Revolution both in France and in England. We have
seen him risking his head by voting for commuting the sentence of Louis
XVI from death to exile. In December of that year 1793, apparently at
the instigation of Robes- pierre, 2 the Convention decreed the expulsion
of all foreigners from its mem- bership. There were only two: Anacharsis
Qoots and Thomas Paine. Ex- pecting arrest, Paine wrote hurriedly what
is now Part I of The Age of Reason. He sent the manuscript to America
with the following dedication.</p>
<p>To my Fellow-Citizens of the United States of America: I put the
following work under your protection. It contains my opinions on
religion. You will do me the justice to remember that I have always
strenuously supported the Right</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>of every Man to his own opinion, however different that may be to
mine. He who denies to another his right, makes a slave of himself to
his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing
it.</p>
<p>The most formidable weapon against error of every kind is Reason, and
I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.</p>
<p>Your affectionate friend and fellow-citizen.</p>
<p>Thos. Paine</p>
<p>Paris, Jan. 27, 1794</p>
<p>At the outset Paine gave an unexpected reason why he had written the
book: not to destroy religion, but to prevent the decay of its
irrational forms from undermining social order, “lest in the general
wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false
theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology
that is true.” And he added, reassuringly: “I believe in one God, and no
more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.” 3</p>
<p>Then he drew his Occam’s razor:</p>
<p>I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the
Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the
Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my
own church. All national institutions of churches… appear to me no other
than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and
monopolize power and profit. 4</p>
<p>He admired Christ as “a virtuous and an amiable man,” and “the
morality that he preached and practiced was of the most benevolent
kind”; but the story of his being fathered by a god was just a variation
of a myth common among the pagans.</p>
<p>Almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen
mythology were reputed to be the sons of… gods… The intercourse of gods
with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter,
according to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds. The story,
therefore, had nothing in it either new, wonderful, or obscene; it was
conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called
Gentiles,… and it was those people only that believed it. The Jews, who
had kept strictly to the belief of one God and no more, and had always
rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the story. 5</p>
<p>So the Christian mythology was merely the pagan mythology in a new
form.</p>
<p>The trinity of the gods that then followed was no other than a
reduction of the former plurality, which was about twenty or thirty
thousand; the statue of Mary succeeded that of Diane of Ephesus; the
deification of heroes changed into the canonization of saints. The
mythologists had gods for everything; the Christian mythologists had
saints for everything; the Church had become as crowded with one as the
pantheon had been with the other… The Christian theory is little else
than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommo- dated to the
purposes of power and revenue; and it yet remains to reason and
philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud. 6</p>
<p>396</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XPaine then played his searchlight of reason upon the Book of
Genesis, and, having no patience with parables, fell heavily upon Eve
and the apple. Like Milton, he was fascinated by Satan, the first of all
rebels. Here was an angel who, for trying to depose a monarch, had been
plunged into hell, there to suffer time without end. Nevertheless he
must have escaped those inextin- guishable fires now and then, for he
had found his way into the Garden of Eden, and could tempt most
sinuously; he could promise knowledge to Eve and half the world to
Christ. The Christian mythology, Paine marveled, did Satan wondrous
honor; it assumed that he could compel the Almighty to send his son down
to Judea and be crucified to recover for him at least a part of a planet
obviously in love with Satan; and despite that crucifixion, the Devil
still retained all non-Christian realms, and had millions of servitors
in Christendom itself.</p>
<p>All this, said our doubting Thomas, was offered us most solemnly, on
the word of the Almighty himself, through a series of amanuenses from
Moses to Saint Paul. Paine rejected it as a tale fit for nurseries, and
for adults too busy with bread and butter, sickness and mortality, to
question the promis- sory notes sold to them by the theologians. To
stronger souls he offered a God not fashioned like man, but conceived as
the life of the universe.</p>
<p>It is only in the Creation that all of our ideas… of God can unite.
The Creation speaketh an universal language;… and this word of God
reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of God.</p>
<p>Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of
the Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the
unchange- able order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed. Do
we want to contemplate his munificence? We see it in the abandon with
which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it
in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine,
do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the
Scripture,… but the Scripture called the Creation. 7</p>
<p>He was imprisoned from December 28, 1793, till the fall of
Robespierre, July 27, 1794. On November 4 “the Convention, to repair as
much as lay in their power the injustice I had sustained, invited me,
publicly and unani- mously, to return to the Convention,… and I
accepted.” 8 Amid the turmoil of the Thermidorean reaction he composed
Part II of T he Age of Reason; it was devoted to a laborious critique of
the Bible, and added little to what more scholarly studies — many of
them by clergymen — had already provided. Both in England and in America
his protestations of belief in God were lost in his impassioned
rejection of a Bible dear to the people and precious to the government,
and he found himself without honor in both his native and his adoptive
land. When, in 1802, he returned to New York (which had formerly
rewarded his services to the American public by giving him a 300-acre
estate at New Rochelle), he received a cool reception, only partly
countered by Jefferson’s faithful friendship. His last seven years were
darkened by addiction to drink. He died in New York in 1809. Ten years
later William Cobbett had Paine’s bones removed to England. There his
un-</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>discourageable spirit, through his books, played a part in the long
campaigns that produced the Reform Act of 1832.</p>
<p>Though Paine was a deist rather than an atheist, many believers in
Chris- tianity felt that his deism was only a polite cover for disbelief
in a personal God. William Paley, rector of Bishop- Wearmouth, gave so
able a defense of his faith in A View of the Evidences of Christianity
(1794) that a read- ing of this book remained till 1900 a prerequisite
for admission to Cambridge University. Still more famous was his Natural
Theology (1802), which sought to prove the existence of a Supreme
Intelligence by accumulating, from the sciences themselves, evidences of
design in nature. If, he argued, a man who had never seen a watch came
upon one and examined its mecha- nism, would he not take for granted
that some intelligent being had designed it? But are there not in nature
hundreds of operations indicating the arrange- ment of means to a
desired effect?</p>
<p>At one end we see intelligent Power arranging planetary systems;… at
the other,… providing an appropriate mechanism for the clasping and
unclasping of the filaments of the feather of a humming bird…. Every
organized natural body, in the provisions which it contains for its
sustentation and propagation, testifies a care, on the part of the
Creator, expressly directed to these purposes. 9</p>
<p>Half of literate England began to discuss Paley’s books and watch;
Cole - ridge, Wordsworth, and Hazlitt talked about them in a lively
debate at Keswick. The Natural Theology had a long life; the great
Darwin himself studied it carefully 10 before formulating his rival
theory that the adjustment of organs to desirable ends had come about
through natural selection. A cen- tury after Paley, Henri Bergson
eloquently rephrased the “argument from design” in V Evolution creatrice
( 1906). The debate goes on.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>GODWIN ON JUSTICE</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite forgotten today, William Godwin (1756-1836) was the most influ-
ential English philosopher of his generation. “No work in our time,”
wrote Hazlitt toward 1823 , “gave such a blow to the philosophical mind
of this country as the celebrated Enquiry Concerning Political Justice.”
11 “Throw away your books of chemistry,” Wordsworth told a young
student, “and read Godwin on Necessity”; 12 and in Godwin’s old age,
when he had come to doubt himself, he saw his ideas broadcast on the
wings of song by his son-in-law Shelley. He would probably have been put
in jail except for the high price he charged for his book.</p>
<p>His parents were devout Calvinists, dedicated to the
predestinarianism that in Godwin became determinism. His father was a
Nonconformist minister; he himself was educated for the pulpit, and
served as clergyman in divers towns. While so functioning at Stowmarket
he was introduced by a young republican to the French philosophers, who
soon upset his faith. He took atheism from d’Holbach, though in later
years he graciously made a place</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xfor God in his congested volume. He took from Helvetius the belief
in edu- cation and reason as the progenitors of utopia. He followed
Rousseau in ac- cepting the native goodness of men, but he preferred
philosophical anarchism to Rousseau’s omnipotent state. He abandoned the
Christian ministry, and set out to butter his bread with pen and ink. He
joined Lord Stanhope and Thomas Holcroft in a club of “revolutionists,”
but for the most part he gave himself to arduous study and difficult
writing; and in 1793, aged thirty- seven, he issued the most radical
major work of his time.</p>
<p>He called it Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and Its Influence
on</p>
<p>General Virtue and Happiness. Apparently a book on government, it
cov- ered nearly all the problems of philosophy, from perception to
statesman- ship, stopping just short of God. He scorned the fables of
heaven and hell as transparent devices to promote obedience and
facilitate government. 13 He condemned clergymen who swore acceptance of
the Thirty-nine Articles of the official faith while privately
discarding them. 14 He rejected free will, and the will itself if
understood as a distinct faculty; it was for him merely an abstract term
for conscious responses to stimuli, situations, or desires. 13 Since
actions are determined by heredity, individual experience, and present
circumstances, we should meet the wrongdoings of others without anger or
recrimination, and we should reform our penal system to rehabilitate
rather than punish; however, it may be necessary to use praise, blame,
and punish- ment as providing corrective memories in future temptations.
16</p>
<p>What should we praise, and what condemn? The morally good, and
morally bad? And what is good? Following Helvetius (1758) and Bentham
(1789), Godwin defined the good as that which promotes individual or
group happiness, and he defined happiness as consistent pleasure of
body, mind, or feeling. This ethical philosophy is not hedonistic or
sensual, for it ranks intellectual pleasures above those of the senses.
It is not egoistic or selfish, for it recognizes that the individual is
part of a group; that the good of the group is prerequisite to the
security of its constituent individuals; and that among the highest of
all pleasures are those that an individual may derive from contributing
to the happiness of his fellow men. Our social instincts generate
altruistic actions, and these actions can give us a pleasure keener and
more lasting than any delight of sense or intellect. 17 To be kind is to
be happy; to be unkind is to be miserable. “Morality, the science of
human happiness,” is “the principle which binds the individual to the
species, and the inducements which are calculated to persuade us to
model our conduct on the way most conducive to the advantage of all.”
18</p>
<p>Justice, then, is the regulation of conduct, in the individual and
the group, for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. “The
immediate object of government is security for the group or the
individual.” S ince the individual desires as much freedom as comports
with his security, “the most desirable state of mankind is that which
maintains general security with the smallest encroachment upon
individual independence.” 19 Hence there is no need for governmental or
religious sanctions for marriage; the mutual agreement of</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>399</p>
<p>wo adults to live together should suffice; and the union should be
dissoluble at the desire of either party. 20 (This line especially
pleased Shelley.)</p>
<p>Godwin did not like governments. Whatever their form or theory, they
were, in practice, the domination of a majority by a minority. He
repudiated the conservative contention that the masses were congenitally
inferior and always potentially murderous, and therefore had to be ruled
by fable, terror, or force. Like Owen, he thought that most
inferiorities were due to in- adequate education, narrow opportunities,
or environmental blight. 21 He laughed at equality before the law, when
every day saw a moneyed wrong- doer freed, by legal trickery or judicial
favor, from the penalty of his crime. 22 He was not a socialist; he
accepted the institution — and the inheri- tance — of property, 23 and
opposed governmental control of production or distribution; 24 but he
insisted that private property should be considered a public trust, 25
and warned that the concentration of wealth was inviting revolution.
26</p>
<p>However, he had no taste f or revolution. “Till the character of the
hu - man species is essentially altered,” any forcible overthrow of the
existing system, any violent attempt to redistribute wealth, would cause
a social dis- ruption “more injurious to the common welfare than the
inequality it at - tempted to remove.” 27 “A revolution of opinion is
the only means of attain - ing a better distribution of wealth,” 28 and
this will require a long and patient</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to require a general education through a national
system of schools would be a mistake, for these would be tools of
national chauvinism leading to war, and of governmental propaganda aimed
to instill a blind obedience. 29 Education should be left to private
enterprise, should always tell the truth, and should habituate the
student to reason. “Reason is not an independent principle” or faculty,
“and has no tendency to incite us to ac - tion; in a practical view it
is merely a comparison and balancing of different feelings. Reason… is
calculated to regulate our conduct according to the comparative worth it
ascribes to different excitements” or impulses. “Mo - rality is nothing
but a calculation of conse quences,” 30 including the conse - quences to
the group. “It is therefore to the improvement of reason that we</p>
<p>The road to utopia through education is long and arduous, but man has
made some progress on that road, and there is no visible limit to his
further advance. The goal is a humanity sufficiently instructed and
foresightful to act reasonably and freely. Anarchism is the distant
ideal, but for many gen- erations to come it will remain an ideal, and
the nature of man will necessi- tate some form of government. We must
continue to hope that, in our distant and cleansed descendants,
intelligence will graduate into orderly free- dom.</p>
<p>There must have been a rich fount of intellectual energy in Godwin,
for in 1794, only a year after publishing his ponderous Enquiry, he
issued what many judged to be the outstanding novel of the time, Caleb
Williams, which</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xshowed “the spirit and character of the government intruding itself
in every rank of society.” To this story the author added his own living
romance: he married Mary Wollstonecraft (1797), adopted her free-love
daughter Fanny Imlay, and Lived with Mary for a year in stimulating
companionship. “I honored her intellectual powers,” he said, “and the
noble generosity of her propensities; mere tenderness would not have
been adequate to produce the happiness which we experienced.” 32 She di
ed, as we have seen, shortly after giving birth to Mary Godwin
Shelley.</p>
<p>In 1801 he married Mrs. Mary Jane Clairmont, whose daughter (by her
first husband) was to be one of Byron’s mistresses. Godwin and his wife
supported their complex brood by publishing books, among them the Tales
from Shakespeare (1807) of Charles and Mary Lamb. In the reaction which
drew Wordsworth and Coleridge from his friendship Godwin fell upon hard
times, and he too shared in the natural conservatism of old age.
Shelley, himself in straits, helped him; and in 1833, by the irony of
history, the gov- ernment, which he had tolerated as a necessary evil,
made him a “yeoman usher of the Exchequer,” with a modest pension that
fed him till he died (1836).</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MALTHUS ON POPULATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Godwin’s Enquiry provoked into print a book far more famous than his
own. The process was aided by the unusual reaction of a son against his
father’s liberal philosophy.</p>
<p>Daniel Malthus (died 1800) was an amiable eccentric, a personal
friend of David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He shared the skepticism
of the Scot and the pessimism of the Swiss about civilization. He
attended personally to his son’s pre -college education, and trusted
that Thomas Malthus (1766-</p>
<ol start="1834" type="1">
<li>would be a law-abiding radical like himself and Godwin. Thomas went
through Cambridge, and entered the Anglican ministry in 1797. When
Godwin’s book appeared (1793), father and son had many fond debates over
its contents. Thomas did not share his father’s enthusiasm about it.
This utopian fancy of triumphant reason, he felt, would be repeatedly
stultified by the simple fact, so pithily declared in the Book of
Ecclesiastes, that when the supply of food rises its beneficence is soon
annulled by an increase in population. As the fertility of the earth is
limited, and there is no bound to the sexual mania of men, the
multiplication of mouths — through earlier mar- riage, reckless
reproduction, lowered infantile and senile mortality — must soon consume
the augmented food. The father did not accept this conclu- sion, but he
admired the force with which it had been argued, and he asked his son to
write out his views. Thomas did, and the result was published in 1798 as
An Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future
Improvement of Society.</li>
</ol>

it challenged:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>401</p>
<p>I cannot doubt the talents of such men as Godwin and Condorcet…. I
have read some of their speculations, on the perfectibility of men and
society, with great pleasure. I have been warmed and delighted with the
enchanting picture which they hold forth. I ardently wish for such happy
improvements. But I see great and, to my understanding, unconquerable
difficulties in the way to them. These difficulties it is my present
purpose to state; declaring, at the same time that so far from exulting
in them as a cause of triumph over the friends of innovation, nothing
would give me greater pleasure than to see them com- pletely removed.
33</p>
<p>Malthus tried to put his argument in mathematical form. Allowing that
the food supply may increase arithmetically every twenty-five years
(from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6, etc.), the population, if unchecked —
and allowing four surviving children to every couple — would increase
geometrically every twenty- five years (from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to
32…). At this rate “in two centuries the population would be to the
means of subsistence as 25 to 9; in three centuries it would be 4,096 to
13; and in 2,000 years the difference would be incalculable.” 34 The
reason why population has not risen so rapidly is that it was limited
both by negative and by positive checks on reproduc- tion. The negative
checks were preventive: the deferment of marriage by poverty or other
causes; “vice” (by which Malthus meant extramarital sex), “unnatural
passions” (homosexuality, sodomy, etc.), and the various means of
contraception in or outside of marriage. When these negative factors
failed to keep population in balance with the food supply, nature and
his- tory provided positive checks operating upon individuals already
existing: infanticide, disease, famine, and war, painfully balancing
births with deaths.</p>
<p>From this somber analysis Malthus drew surprising conclusions. First,
there is no use raising the wages of workingmen, for if wages are
increased the workers will marry earlier and will have more children;
the population will grow; the mouths will increase faster than the food,
and poverty will be restored. Likewise it is useless to raise the “poor
rates” (taxes for the care</p>
<p>To complete his demolition of Godwin, Malthus went on to consider the
“dream” of philosophical anarchism. If government were to disappear, “ev
- ery man would be obliged to guard with force his little store,” as we
bar our doors and windows when law and order fail. “Selfishness would be
tri - umphant… , contention perpetual.” 30 With all restraints removed
from mating and coitus, reproduction would advance faster than
production, over- population would reduce each individual’s allotment of
goods, a nd utopia would collapse in desperate competition, price and
wage spirals, inevitable chaos, spreading misery. 37 Government would
have to be restored; private property would have to be protected to
encourage production and invest- ment; private violence would have to be
suppressed by public force. History would return to its traditional
formula: the products of nature divided by the nature of man.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>XIn a revised and much extended form of the Essay, Malthus laid down,
more clearly and harshly than before, the preventive remedies that might
render unnecessary the catastrophic cures used by nature and history. He
proposed a halt to poor relief, and a check on interference with free
enter- prise; the law of supply and demand should be left to operate in
the relations of producers and consumers, employers and employees. Early
marriage must be discouraged to keep the birth rate down. “Our
obligation” is “not to marry till we have a fair pro spect of being able
to support our children.” 38 Above all, men must learn moral restraint
before and after marriage. “The interval between the age of puberty and…
marriage must… be passed in strict chastity.” 39 Within marriage there
must be no contraception in any way or form. If these or equivalent
regulations are not observed we must resign ourselves to periodical
reductions of overpopulation by famine, pesti- lence, or war.</p>
<p>The Essay on Population was received as a divine revelation by the
con- servative elements of the British people. Parliament and the
employers felt warranted in resistance to the demands of liberals like
Robert Owen for legal mitigations of the “laws” of supply and demand.
William Pitt withdrew the bill he had introduced for extending poor
relief. 40 The measures already taken by the government against British
radicals seemed justified by Mal- thus’ contention that these peddlers
of utopia were seducing simple souls to tragic delusions. British
manufacturers were strengthened in their belief that low wages made for
disciplined labor and obedience. Ricardo made the Malthusian theory the
foundation of his “dismal science.” (It was after read - ing Malthus
that Carlyle gave that name to economics.) Now nearly all the evil
incident to the Industrial Revolution could be ascribed to the reckless
fertility of the poor.</p>
<p>The liberals were at first thrown into dismay and disarray by
Malthus’ Essay. Godwin took twenty years to draw up his answer, and then
his book Of Population, an Answer to Malthus (1820) was mostly a
reiteration of his hopes, and a complaint that Malthus had converted the
friends of progress into reactionaries by the hundred. 41 William
Hazlitt was an exception: in an essay on Malthus in The Spirit of the
Age (1824), he attacked the merciless divine with all the sharp edge of
his intellect. The fertility of plants, he thought, could be relied upon
to outrun the fertility of women. “A grain of corn will multiply and
propagate itself much faster even than the human spe- cies. A bushel of
wheat will sow a field; that field will furnish seed for 20 others.” 42
There will be “green revolutions.”</p>
<p>Later writers brought up an array of facts to calm Malthusian fears.
In Europe, in China, in India, population has more than doubled after
Mal- thus; yet their people are better fed than before. In the United
States the population has doubled several times since 1800;
nevertheless, despite an ever lower percentage of the people required
for it, agriculture produces more adequately than ever before, and has
an immense surplus for export. Contrary to Malthus, the rise in wages
has brought not an increase but a lowering of the birth rate. The
problem is no longer a deficiency of seeds or</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>4«3</p>
<p>fields but a shortage in the supply of nonhuman energy to operate the
mech- anisms of agriculture and industry, of villages and towns.</p>
<p>Of course the real answer to Malthus has been contraception — its
moral acceptance, its wider dissemination, its greater efficacy, its
lower cost. The general secularization of thought broke down the
theological barriers to birth control. The Industrial Revolution
transformed children from the eco- nomic assets they had been on the
farm to the economic handicaps they became in cities as child labor
slowly diminished, as education became ex- pensive, as urban crowding
rose. Intelligence spread: men and women real- ized that changed
conditions no longer required large families. Even war now demanded
technical inventiveness for competition in material destruc- tion rather
than masses of young men deployed in competitive homicide.</p>
<p>So the answer to Malthus came not from Godwin’s theories but from the
“Neo - Malthusians” and their propaganda for birth control. In 1822
Francis Place published Illustrations and Proofs of the Principle of
Population. He accepted Malthus’ principle that population tends to
increase faster than the food supply. Restraint, he agreed, is
necessary, but not by postponing mar- riage; better would be the
acceptance of contraception as a legitimate and relatively moral
substitute for nature’s blind fertility and war’s wholesale destruction.
(He himself had fifteen children, of whom five died in child- hood.) He
scattered through London handbills printed at his own expense,
advocating birth control; and he continued his campaign till his death
at the age of eighty-three (1854).</p>
<p>Malthus lived long enough to feel the force of Place’s arguments. In
1824 he contributed to the Encyclopaedia Britannic a an article revising
his the- ory, withdrawing his frightening mathematical ratios, and
laying new stress upon overpopulation as a factor in the struggle for
existence. Many years later Charles Darwin wrote in his Autobiography
:</p>
<p>In October, 1838, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic
enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population; and
being well pre- pared to appreciate the struggle for existence… from
long-continued obser- vation of the habits of animals and plants, it at
once struck me that under these circumstances favorable variations would
tend to be preserved, and unfavorable ones to be destroyed. The result
of this would be the formation of a new species. Here then I had at last
got hold of a theory by which to work.</p>
<p>So, after almost a generation of further research and thought, Darwin
pub- lished (1859) The Origin of Species, the most influential book of
the nine- teenth century. The Chain of Ideas adorns the “Great Chain of
Being,” and underlies the history of civilization.</p>

<li>BENTHAM ON LAW</li>
</ol>
<p>Bentham is a harder nut to milk than Godwin or Malthus, for Godwin
offered tempting ideals and Malthus some fascinating terrors, while
Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) wrote on economics, usury, utility, law,
justice, and</p>
<p>4 o 4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Xprisons — none of which is very charming; besides, he himself was a
seclusive giant, endlessly learned, pondering imponderables, publishing
little, reform- ing everything, and crying out for the marriage of two
ogres — logic and law. Yet his influence, rising through his eighty-four
years, surmounted his time and pervaded a century.</p>
<p>He was the son of a wealthy attorney, who almost crushed him with
edu- cation. We are told that by the age of three he had read Paul de
Rapin’s eight-volume History of England, and had begun the study of
Latin. (This suffocating pedagogy was passed on to Bentham’s disciple
James Mill, who used it on his son John.) At Westminster School Jeremy
excelled in writing Greek and Latin poetry. At Oxford he specialized in
logic, and took his degree at fifteen. He went on to study law at
Lincoln’s Inn, but the chaos of the lawbooks aroused his ire, and he
resolved, at whatever cost, to bring reason and order into British
jurisprudence and legislation. In December, 1763, aged fi fteen, he
heard Sir William Blackstone’s eulogy of English law; he was astonished
and repelled by this unquestioning adulation, which could only delay
legal reform. From that time almost to his death he thought of bringing
rationality, consistency, and humanity into English law. “Have I,” he
asked himself, “a genius for anything? What can I produce?… What, of all
earthly pursuits, is the most important? Legislation. Have I a genius
for legislation? I gave my self the answer, fearfully and tremblingly:
‘Yes’” 43 This timid pride can be the fount of achievement.</p>
<p>He brought to his task a mind realistic, sworn to order and reason.
He re- sented such oppressive abstractions as duty, honor, power, and
right; he liked to break them down into specific realities, and to
examine each part with a persistent view to fact. What, for instance, is
a right? Is it “natural”— something due us from birth, as the French
Revolution’s Declaration of the Rights of Man supposed? — or is it
merely an individual liberty subordinate to public good? What is
equality? Is there any such thing outside of a mathematical abstraction?
Is inequality of ability, possessions, and power the inevitable fate of
every living thing? What is “common sense” or “natural law”? All these
abstractions, in Bentham’s opinion, were “nonsense on stilts,” 44
strutting obstructively in universities, Parliaments, and courts.</p>
<p>We may imagine what such an impatient realist did to the theology
cur- rent in his time and place. He found no use for the traditional
deity in his attempt to see with impartial eye the world of science,
history, economics, law, or government. 45 He tried to hold his sharp
tongue about these matters, for he felt that the Anglican Church was
comparatively rational, and might be made beneficent; but the clergy
felt his silent hostility, and denounced his utilitarianism, quite
justly, as a “godless philosophy.” 46</p>
<p>He began by trying to depose Blackstone as the web-weaving encomiast
of the British Constitution. That mystical entity appeared to him as a
patch- work and antiquated product of casual contingencies,
contradictory com- promises, hasty amendments, and passing inspirations,
bound with no logic and rooted in no principle. So (while the American
colonies were ignoring that landed gentlemen’s agreement) Bentham
issued, as one spark from his</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>anvil, A Fragment on Government (1776) — the first blow of tha t
“philo - sophical radicalism” which was to struggle for half a century
before win - ning half a victory in 1832.</p>
<p>The twenty-eight-year-old challenger, while praising Blackstone for
hav- ing “taught jurisprudence to speak the language of scholars and
gentlemen,” reproved him for reducing the constitution to the
sovereignty of the king. £ contra, a sane constitution will distribute
the powers of government among the different parts thereof, and will
facilitate their cooperation and mutual restraint. The guiding principle
of legislators must be not the will of a superior but “the greatest
happiness of the greatest number” of those for whom they legislate; and
the proper test of a proposed law is its utility to that end. 47 Here,
in the famous “principle of utility,” was the essence of Bentham’s legal
and ethical teaching. It was a remarkable correlate of the</p>
<p>The little book had been written in a style more intelligible, and in
a spirit more attractive, than those of Bentham’s later treatises. He
spent some time now in travel. From Russia, in 1787, he sent to England
a Defence of Usury — i.e., interest. He opposed the theological
condemnation of interest; in economics, as in politics, the individual
should be left as free to use his own judgment as the good of the
community would allow. Bentham was a liberal, but in the
eighteenth-century understanding of that word as mean- ing a defender of
liberty; he agreed with the Physiocrats and Jefferson that the state
should keep to a minimum its interference with individual freedom. He
was a radical — a get-to-the-root man; but he was not in favor of
national- izing industry. In 1787 there was not much industry to
nationalize.</p>
<p>On his return from Russia, Bentham prepared for publication his major
work: The Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789; his press inclined
to revolutionary dates). It is a difficult book, sternly propped with a
hundred definitions, yet leaving the unprofessional reader considerably
confused at the close. But Bentham was undertaking a mind-breaking task:
to replace a theological with a natural ethic; to base conduct and law
upon group or national need rather than upon the will of an executive or
a class; and to lib- erate law and conduct from religious decrees at one
end and revolutionary dreams at the other. A man undertaking such tasks
might be allowed an oc- casional sin against a writer’s moral obligation
to be clear.</p>
<p>The new basis, of both morality and law, was to be the principle of
utility — the usefulness of an act to the individual, of a custom to the
group, of a law to the people, of an international agreement to mankind.
Bentham took it for granted that all organisms seek pleasure and shun
pain. Pleasure he de- fined as any satisfaction, pain as any
dissatisfaction, of body or mind. Utility is the quality of producing
pleasure or avoiding pain; happiness is the conti- nuity and consistency
of pleasures. The utility need not be entirely to the individual agent;
it may be, partly or primarily, to the family, the commu- nity, the
state, or mankind. The individual may (through his social instincts)</p>

that of the</p>
<p>Bentham did not pretend to have originated his utilitarian formula.
He declared, with his usual candor, that he had found it in Joseph
Priestley’s Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). He could
have found it in Francis Hutcheson’s Enquiry Concerning Moral Good and
Evil (1725), which defined the good citizen a s one who has promoted
“the greatest hap - piness of the greatest number”; 50 or in Beccaria’s
Trattato dei aelitti e delle pene (1764), which described the moral test
and goal as “la massima felicitH divisa nel maggior numero or, most
clearly, in Helvet ius’ De VEsprit</p>
<p>(1758): “Utility is the principle of all human virtues, and the
foundation of</p>
<p>His achievement was to apply “the principle of the greatest
happiness” (his final formula) to the laws of England. He now had a
moral imperative of clear import, and a test by which to judge the
injunctions of preachers, the exhortations of teachers, the principles
of parties, the laws of legislators, the edicts of kings. The law must
admit no mystical entities like “rights,” natural, popular, or divine;
no revelations from God to Moses or Mohammed or Christ; no punishments
for vengeance’ sake. Every proposal must answer the question Cui bono?,
For whose good will it be? — for one, or a few, or many, or all? Law
must adjust itself to the ineradicable nature and limited capacities of
men, and to the practical needs of society; it must be clear, and permit
of practical enforcement, expeditious trial, prompt judicial judgment,
and penalties corrective and humane. To these ends Bentham devoted the
last ten chapters of his book, and the final years of his life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he applied his testing rod to the issues of the day. He
upheld the Physiocratic doctrine of laissez-faire in industry and
politics. Generally the individual is the best judge of his own
happiness, and should be left as free as socially practicable to seek it
in his own way; however, society should encourage voluntary
associations, whose members would surrender part of their liberties to
united effort for a common cause. From the same principles Bentham
argued that representative government, with all its faults and multiple
corruption, is best.</p>
<p>The Principles of Morals and Legislation received a wider acclaim
than might have been expected from the difficulties of its form and
style, its criti- cal spirit, and its strongly secular bent. Its welcome
abroad was warmer than at home. France translated him, and made him a
French citizen in 1792. Political leaders and thinkers corresponded with
him from various capitals</p>
<p>CHAP. XIX)</p>
<p>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>and universities on the Continent. In England the Tories condemned
utili- tarianism as unpatriotic, un-Christian, and materialistic. Some
writers urged that many actions — romantic or parental love,
self-sacrifice, mutual aid — in- volve no conscious calculation of
egoistic satisfactions. Artists balked at judging works of art according
to their usefulness. But all except officehold- ers agreed that
self-interest is the ethic and policy of all governments, when disguise
and pretense have been removed.</p>
<p>Bentham lived up to his philosophy, and made his years unremittingly
useful. In Rationale of Judicial Evidence (1825), and elsewhere, he
strove to clarify old laws and present cases, and succeeded in
moderating the bar- barous excesses of traditional penology. He began in
1827, aged seventy- nine, to codify English law, but death caught him
between Volumes I and II. He took part in establishing The Westminster
Review (1823) as an or- gan of liberal ideas. He gathered about him a
band of disciples who recog- nized the warm heart behind the crusty
exterior. Pierre-Etienne Dumont was his apostle in France; James Mill,
himself an outstanding thinker, edited the master’s manuscript into
readability; John Stuart Mill raised the cause from calculus to
humanity.</p>
<p>Led by Bentham, these “philosophical radicals” worked for adult m ale
suffrage, secret ballot, free trade, public sanitation, the improvement
of pris- ons, the cleansing of the judiciary, the chastening of the
House of Lords, and the development of international law. Till the 1860s
the individualistic and freedom-ori ented elements in Bentham’s
philosophy were stressed by his followers; thereafter the socialism
lurking in “the greatest happiness of the greatest number” turned the
current of reform toward the use of govern - ment as an agent of the
public will in attacking public ills.</p>
<p>Dying, Bentham puzzled over the problem of making his corpse fully
use- ful to the greatest number. He directed that it should be dissected
in the presence of his friends. It was. Then the cranium was filled and
faced with wax, the skeleton was dressed in Bentham’s somber and
habitual garb, and was set upright in a glass case in University
College, Cambridge, where it remains to this day.</p>
