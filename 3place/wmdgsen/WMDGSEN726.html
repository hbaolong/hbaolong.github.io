<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>Switzerland and Voltaire</p>
<p>1 7 1 5 — 5 ^</p>
<p>I. LES DEUCES</p>
<p>O N the Lyons road, just outside the gates of Geneva but within
its</p>
<p>jurisdiction, Voltaire at last found a place where he could lie
down</p>
<p>in security and peace, a spacious villa called St. -Jean, with
terraced gardens descending to the Rhone. As the laws of the republic
forbade the sale of land to any but Swiss Protestants, he provided the
87,000 francs that bought the property (February, 1755) through the
agency of Labat de Grandcour and Jean Robert Tronchin.* With all the
enthusiasm of a city dweller he bought chickens and a cow, sowed a
vegetable garden, and planted trees; it had taken him sixty years to
learn that “i/ faut cultiver notre jardin .” Now, he thought, he could
forget Frederick, Louis XV, the Parlement of Paris, the bishops, the
Jesuits; only his colic and his headaches remained. He was so pleased
with his new home that he named it Les De- lices (delights) .t “I am so
happy,” he wrote to Thieriot, “that I am</p>
<p>ashamed.” 1</p>
<p>As his clever investments were bringing him a lordly income, he
indulged himself in lordly luxuries. He kept six horses, four carriages,
a coachman, a postilion, two lackeys, a valet, a French cook, a
secretary, and a monkey — with whom he liked to compare homo sapiens.
Over this establishment reigned Mme. Denis, whom Mme. d’Lpinay, visiting
Les Delices in 1757, described as</p>
<p>a fat little woman, as round as a ball, about fifty years of age; . .
. ugly and good, untruthful without meaning it, and without malice. She
has no intellect, and yet seems to have some; she . . . writes verses,
argues rationally and irrationally; . . . without too great
pretentiousness, and above all without offending anyone. . . . She
adores her uncle, both as uncle and as a man; Voltaire loves her, laughs
at her, and worships her.</p>
<p>In a word, this house is a refuge for an assemblage of contraries,
and a delightful spectacle for lookers-on. 2</p>
<ul>
<li>There were many Tronchins, chiefly: (1) Jean Robert, banker -and
procureur general of Geneva; (2) Jakob, councilor; (3) Francois, author
and painter; (4) Theodore, physician. “Tronchin” will mean Theodore
unless otherwise stated.</li>
</ul>
<p>t It is still there (1965), much reduced in area, but maintained by
the city of Geneva as the Institut et Musee Voltaire.</p>
<p>472</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>Another visitor, the rising poet Marmontel, described the new
seigneur: “He was in bed when we arrived. He held out his arms, embraced
me, and wept for joy. . . . ‘You find me at the point of death,’ he
said; ‘come and restore me to life, or receive my last sigh’. … A moment
later he said, ‘I will rise and dine with you.’” 3</p>
<p>There was one drawback at Les Delices — it was cold in winter.
Voltaire, having no flesh, needed heat. Near Lausanne he found a little
hermitage, Monrion, whose position sheltered it from the north wind; he
bought it, and spent there some winter months in 1755-57. In Lausanne
itself he bought (June, 1757), on the Rue du Grand Chene, a “house which
would be called a palace in Italy,” with fifteen windows looking down
upon the lake.* There, without any protest from the clergy, he staged
plays, usually his own. “Tranquillity is a fine thing,” he wrote, “but
ennui . . . belongs to the same family. To repulse the ugly relation I
have set up a theater.” 4</p>
<p>And so, oscillating between Geneva and Lausanne, he became acquainted
with Switzerland.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE CANTONS</li>
</ol>
<p>“By what wonderful policy,” asked Samuel Johnson in 1742, “or by</p>
<p>what happy conciliation of interests, is it brought to pass that in a
body made up of different communities and different religions there
should be no vivid commotions, though the people are so warlike that to
nominate and raise an army is the same?” 5</p>
<p>This fascinating complex of three peoples, four languages, and two
faiths had remained at peace with the outside world since 1515. By a
kind of honor among thieves the powers refrained from attacking it; it
was too tiny a prize (227 miles in its greatest length, 137 in its
greatest breadth), too poor in natural resources, too mountainous in
terrain, and its people were discouragingly brave. The Swiss continued
to produce the best soldiers in Europe, but as these were costly to
maintain they were leased to divers governments at so much a head. In
1748 there were sixty thousand such Reislaufer in foreign service. In
some countries they became a permanent part of the military
establishment; they were the favorite and most trusted guards of the
popes and the French kings; all the world knows how the Swiss Guards
died to a man in defense of Louis XVI on August 10, 1792.</p>
<p>In 1715 thirteen cantons constituted the Swiss Confederation:
Appenzell, Basel, Glarus, Schaffhausen, and Zurich, which were
predominantly Ger- man and Protestant; Lucerne, Schwyz, Solothurn,
Unterwalden, Uri, and Zug, which were German and Catholic; Bern, which
was both German and French, Protestant and Catholic; and Fribourg, which
was French and</p>

Voltaire.</li>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>

<p>Catholic. In 1803 the Confederation admitted Aargau, St. Gallen, and
Thurgau (German and Protestant), Ticino (Italian and Catholic), and</p>
<p>Vaud (French and Protestant). In 1815 three new cantons were added:
Geneva (French and Protestant, now rapidly becoming Catholic), Valais
(French, German, and Catholic), and the region known to the French as
Grisons and to the Germans as Graubiinden (chiefly Protestant, and
speak- ing German or Romansh, a vestigial Latin) .</p>
<p>Switzerland was republican, but not democratic in our current sense.
In each canton a minority of the adult male population, usually the old
estab- lished families, elected a Great Council or General Council of
some two hundred members, and a Small Council of from twenty-four to
sixty-four members. The Small Council appointed a still smaller Privy
Council, and a burgomaster who served as chief executive officer. There
was no separation of powers; the Small Council was also the supreme
court. The rural cantons (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Glarus, Zug,
Appenzell) limited the suffrage to indigenous families; other residents,
no matter how long domiciled, were ruled as a subject class. 6 Such
oligarchies were general in Switzerland. Lu- cerne limited eligibility
for office to twenty-nine families, allowing a new family to enter the
circle only when one of the old families died out. 7 In Bern 243
families were eligible to hold office, but of these some sixty-eight
regularly held the government. In 1789 the Russian historian Nikolai Ka-
ramzin remarked that the citizens of Zurich were “as proud of their
title as a king of his crown,” since “for more than 1 50 years no
foreigner has ob - tained the right of citizenship.” 8 (We must remind
ourselves that nearly</p>
<p>The cantonal government tended to an authoritarian paternalism. The
councils in Zurich issued laws regulating meals, drinking, smoking,
driving, weddings, clothing, personal adornment, the dressing of the
hair, the wages of labor, the quality of products, the prices of
necessaries; these ordinances were relics of old communal or guild
rules; and, indeed, in Zurich the mas- ters of the twelve guilds
automatically became members of the Small Coun- cil, so that this canton
was in considerable measure a corporative state. To- ward the end of the
century Goethe wrote that the shores of the Lake of Zurich gave “a
charming and ideal conception of the fi nest and highest civilization.”
9</p>
<p>The “Town and Republic” of Bern was the largest and strongest of the
cantons. It embraced a third of Switzerland, it had the most prosperous
economy, and its government was generally admired as provident and
competent; Montesquieu compared it with Rome in the best days of the
Republic. William Coxe, a British clergyman and learned historian, de-
scribed the city as he saw it on September 16, 1779:</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>I was much struck, on entering into Bern, with its singular
neatness</p>
<p>and beauty. The principal streets are broad and long, not straight
but gently curved; the houses are almost uniform, built of a grayish
stone upon arcades. Through the middle of the streets runs a lively
stream of the clearest water in a stone channel, while several fountains
are not less ornamental to the place than beneficial to the inhabitants.
The river Aar almost surrounds the town, winding its course over a rocky
bed much below the level of the streets. . . . The adjacent country
is</p>
<p>richly cultivated, and agreeably diversified with hills, lawns,
woods,</p>
<p>and water; . . . and an abrupt chain of rugged and snow-capped alps
bounds the distant horizon. 10</p>
<p>The great failure of the Bernese patriciate was in its treatment of
Vaud. This earthly paradise ran along the Swiss side of the Lake of
Geneva from the outskirts of the city of Geneva to Lausanne (its
capital), and reached northward to the Lake of Neuchatel. On those
lovely shores and grape- vined hills Voltaire and Gibbon enjoyed a
highly civilized life, and Rous- seau grew up and suffered, and placed
his Julie’s virtuous household (at Clarens, near Vevey). The region
passed under Bern’s control in 1536; its citizens lost eligibility to
office, fretted under distant rule, and frequently revolted, but in
vain.</p>
<p>The cantons were watchfully jealous of their autonomy. Each consid-
ered itself a sovereign state, free to make war and peace and enter into
for- eign alliances; so the Catholic cantons associated themselves with
France throughout the reign of Louis XV. To reduce strife among the
cantons each sent delegates to a Swiss Diet meeting in Zurich. But this
federal con- gress had very limited powers: it could not impose its
decisions upon any unwilling canton; its resolutions, to be valid,
required the consent of all. Free trade was accepted in principle, but
was violated by intercantonal tariff wars. There was no common currency,
no joint administration of intercantonal roads.</p>
<p>The economic life flourished despite natural obstacles and
legislative barriers. Serfdom had disappeared except in a few districts
alongThe Ger- man or Austrian border; nearly all peasants owned the soil
they tilled. In th e “Forest Cantons” (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and
Lucerne) the peas - ants were poor because of geographical conditions;
around Zurich they prospered; in the Bernese several peasants
accumulated fortunes through careful and resolute husbandry. Long
winters and difficulties of transport forced many Swiss to combine
agriculture and industry; the same family that spun cotton or made
watches planted gardens or cultivated the vine. Fribourg was already
famous for its Gruyere cheese, Zurich for its lace, St. Gallen for its
cotton, Geneva for watches, Neuchatel for lace, all Switzer- land for
wines. Swiss finance was even then the envy of Europe, and Swiss</p>
<p>47 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>merchants were active everywhere. Basel throve on trade with France
and Germany, Zurich on trade with Germany and Austria. Basel, Geneva,
and Lausanne rivaled Amsterdam and The Hague as centers of publishing.
After Haller and Rousseau had celebrated the gleaming beauty of Swiss
lakes and the imposing majesty of the Swiss Alps, tourism provided a
grow- ing support for the federal economy.</p>
<p>The level of morals was probably higher in Switzerland than in
any</p>
<p>other European land except Scandinavia, where similar conditions pro-
duced similar results. The peasant family was a model of industry,
sobriety, unity, and thrift. In the cities there was some corruption of
politics and selling of offices, but even there the austerity generated
by a hard climate, a mountainous terrain, and a Protestant ethic made
for moral stability. Dress was modest in the rich as well as in the
poor. In Switzerland sumptu- ary laws were still severe and well
observed . 11</p>
<p>Religion was half the government and half the strife. Regular attend-
ance at church was obligatory, and the towns were too small to let
rebels find refuge in the anonymity of the crowd. Sunday was a day of
almost unrelieved piety; we are told that in Zurich the taverns trembled
with psalms on the Sabbath. 12 But the rival religions — Calvinist and
Catholic — gave the worst example of behavior, for they liberated hatred
and chained the mind. Some Catholic cantons forbade any but Catholic
worship, some Protestant cantons forbade any but the Protestant. 13
Separation from the state church and the formation of independent sects
were prohibited by law. In Lucerne in 1747 Jacob Schmidlin was tortured
and then strangled for trying to organize a Pietist movement independent
of the Church. An oath of Calvinist orthodoxy was required for
eligibility to hold political, ecclesiastical, or educational positions
in the Protestant cantons. 14 Censor- ship was severe by both Church and
state. In the Forest Cantons the pov- erty of the peasants, storms,
landslides, avalanches, blights, floods, and awe of the encompassing
mountains combined to generate a superstitious fear of evil spirits in
glowering peaks and whirling winds. To frustrate their supernatural foes
the harassed rustics begged for priestly exorcisms and ceremonious
blessings of their flocks. Burning for witchcraft ended in Geneva in
1652, in Bern in 1680, in Zurich in 1701, in the Catholic can- tons in
1752; but in Glarus a woman was beheaded in 1782 on a charge of having
bewitched a child. 15</p>
<p>Light was opened irjto this darkness by state schools and public
libraries. The University of Basel was in decline through religious
fanaticism; it hardly appreciated the achievements of Johann, Jakob, and
Daniel Ber- noulli, and made Leonhard Euler flee to more hospitable
halls. Even so, Switzerland produced scholars, poets, and scientists in
full proportion to</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>its population. We have mentioned the Zurich savants Johann Jakob
Bod- mer and Johann Jakob Breitinger; they had a lasting influence on
German literature by countering Gottsched’s idolatry of Boileau and
classic for - mulas; they defended the rights of feeling, of the
mystical, even the irra- tional, in literature and life; they extolled
English over French poetry, and introduced Shakespeare and Milton to
readers of German; they resurrected the Nibelungenlied (1751) and the
minnesingers. Their doctrine passed down to Lessing, Klopstock,
Schiller, and the young Goethe, and opened the way for the Romantic
movement in Germany and the revival of inter- est in the Middle Ages. A
Zurich poet, Salomon Gessner, followed this lead, and issued Idyllen
(1756) — idyls of such pastoral charm that all Eu- rope translated them,
and poets like Wieland and Goethe made pilgrimages to his door.</p>
<p>Next to Jean Jacques Rousseau, the most memorable Swiss of the eight-
eenth century was Albrecht von Haller of Bern, at once the greatest poet
and the greatest scientist of his land and time. In Bern, Tubingen,
Leiden, London, Paris and Basel he studied law, medicine, physiology,
botany, and mathematics. Returning to Bern, he discovered the Alps, felt
their beauty, grandeur, and lines, and broke into poetry. So, aged
twenty-one (1729), he issued a volume of lyrics, Die Alpen, which the
enthusiastic Coxe</p>
<p>thought “as sublime and immortal as the mountains which are the
subject of his song.” 16 The book anticipated Rousseau in almost
everything. It in - vited the world to admire the Alps both for their
inspiring elevation and as a testimonial to God; it denounced cities as
dens of luxury and irreligion leading to physical and moral decay; it
lauded the peasants and mountain- eers for their hardy frames, sturdy
faith, and frugal ways; and it sum- moned men, women, and children to
leave the towns and come out to live in the open air a simpler, saner,
healthier life.</p>
<p>But it was as a scientist that Haller won a European renown. In 1736
George II offered him the professorship of botany, medicine, and surgery
in the University of Gottingen. There he taught for seventeen years,
with such distinction that Oxford and Halle invited him, and Frederick
the Great wanted him to succeed Maupertuis as head of the Berlin
Academy, Catherine II tried to lure him to St. Petersburg, and Gottingen
wished to make him chancellor. Instead he retired to Bern, served as
health officer, economist, and head of his canton, and industriously
prepared one of the century’s scientific masterpieces, Elementa
Physiologiae Corporis humani, which we shall meet again.</p>
<p>Through all these years and sciences he maintained a devout orthodoxy
in religion and a strict integrity of morals. When Voltaire came to live
in Switzerland it seemed to Haller that Satan had set up his standard in
Ge-</p>

<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>neva and Lausanne. Casanova, who rivaled Haller in the appreciation
of beauty, visited both Haller and Voltaire in 1760. Let us enjoy once
more Casanova’s account of the double adventure:</p>
<p>Haller was a big man, six feet tall, and broad in proportion — a
physi- cal and intellectual colossus. He received me with great
affability, and opened his mind, answering all my questions precisely
and modestly.</p>
<p>. . . When I told him I was looking forward to seeing M. de
Voltaire,</p>
<p>he said I was quite right to do so, and he added, without bitterness:
“Monsieur de Voltaire is a man who deserves to be known, although,
contrary to the laws of physics, many people have found him greater at a
distance.”</p>
<p>A few days later Casanova saw Voltaire at Les Delices.</p>
<p>“Monsieur de Voltaire,” said I, “this is the proudest day of my
life.</p>
<p>I have been your pupil for twenty years, and my heart rejoices to see
my master.”</p>
<p>He asked me where I last came from.</p>
<p>“From Roche. I did not want to leave Switzerland without having</p>
<p>seen Haller. … I kept you to the last as a bonne touched</p>
<p>“Were you pleased with Haller?”</p>
<p>“I spent three of the happiest days of my life with him.”</p>
<p>“I congratulate you.”</p>
<p>“I am glad you do him justice. I am sorry he is not so fair
toward</p>
<p>you.”</p>
<p>“Ah ha! Perhaps we are both of us mistaken.” 17</p>
<p>In 1775, as his final word to the world, Haller published Letters
concern- ing Several Late Attempts of Freethinking . . . against
Revelation , an earnest effort to offset Voltaire’s Questions sur
FEncyclopedie . He wrote a touching letter to the dreadful heretic,
inviting him (then eighty-one) to recapture “that tranquillity which
flies at the approach of genius,” but comes to a trusting faith; “then
the most celebrated man in Europe would be also the most happy.” 18
Haller himself never achieved tranquillity. H e was impatient in
sickness, being extremely sensitive to pain; “in his later - proached
himself for hav ing given so much to “my plants and other buf -
fooneries.” 20 He achieved tranquillity on December 1 2, 1777.</p>

<li>GENEVA</li>
</ol>
<p>Geneva was not in this century a canton in the federation; it was
a</p>
<p>separate republic — city and hinterland — with French speech and
Calvinist</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>faith. In his article on Geneva in the Encyclopedic, d’Alembert
described</p>
<p>It is remarkable that a city having hardly 24,000 inhabitants, and
with a territory containing less than thirty villages, has kept its
independ- ence, and is among the most flourishing communities in Europe.
Rich by its freedom and its commerce, it sees all around it on fire,
without ever feeling the effect. The crises that agitate Europe are for
it only a spectacle, which it enjoys without taking part in it. Attached
to France by freedom and trade, to England by commerce and religion,
Geneva pronounces with justice on the wars that these powerful nations
wage against each other, but it is too wise to take sides. It judges all
the sov- ereigns of Europe without flattery, injury, or fear. 21</p>
<p>The emigration of the Huguenots from France was a boon to Geneva;
they brought their savings and their skill, and made the city the watch-
making capital of the world. Mme. d’Epinay reckoned six thousand in the
jewelry trade. 22 Swiss bankers had a reputation for wisdom and
integrity; so Jacques Necker and Albert Gallatin, both Genevans, became
respec- tively finance minister to Louis XVI and treasury secretary of
the United States under Jefferson.</p>
<p>Government in Geneva, as elsewhere, was a class privilege. Only those
male inhabitants who had been born in Geneva of citizen parents and
grandparents were eligible for public office. Below this patrician class
came the bourgeoisie — manufacturers, merchants, shopkeepers, guild
masters, and members of the professions. Annually, in the Cathedral of
St. -Pierre, the patricians and the bourgeoisie, seldom over fifteen
hundred in number, 23 as- sembled to elect a Grand Conseil, or Great
Council, of two hundred mem- bers, and a Petit Conseil of twenty-five.
These councils chose four syndics, each for a year, as the executive
heads of the state. Quite unfranchised were a third class, the
habitants, residents of foreign parentage, and a fourth class, the
natijs, born in Geneva of non-native Genevans. The natijs, forming three
fourths of the population, had no civic rights except that of paying
taxes; they could not engage in business or the professions, nor could
they hold office in the army or mastership in a guild. The political
history of the little republic revolved around the struggles of the
bourgeoisie to be ad- mitted to office, and of the lower classes to be
allowed to vote. In 1737 the burghers took up arms against the
patriciate, and forced it to accept a new constitution: all voters were
made eligible for election to the Grand Con- seil; this was to have the
final decision over war and peace, alliances and taxes, although
legislation could be proposed only by the Petit Conseil; and the natijs,
though still voteless, were admitted to some professions. The</p>
<p>480 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>government continued to be oligarchic, but it was competently
adminis- tered, and relatively immune to corruption.</p>
<p>Next in influence to the patriciate was the Consistory of the
Calvinist clergy. It regulated education, morals, and marriage, and
allowed no secu- lar interference with its authority. There were no
bishops here, and no monks. The philosopher d’Alembert praised the
morals of the Genevan clergy, and described the city as an island of
decency and sobriety, which he contrasted with the moral riot of upper-
class France. Mme. d’fipinay, after several liaisons, applauded the
“strict manners of … a free people, enemy of luxury.” 24 According to
the clergy, however, Genevan youth was going to the devil in cabarets,
and family prayers were being</p>
<p>scrimped; people gossiped in church, and some blase worshipers in the
rear puffed at their pipes to help the sermon go down. 25 The preachers
com- plained that they could inflict only spiritual penalties, and that
their exhor- tations were increasingly ignored.</p>
<p>Voltaire was delighted to find that several members of the Genevan
clergy were rather advanced in their theology. They came to enjoy his
hospitality at Les Delices, and privately confessed that they retained
little of Calvin’s dour creed. One of them, Jacques Vemes, advised in
his Instruc - tion chretienne (1754) that religion be based on reason
when addressing adults, but that “for the common people … it will be
useful to explain these truths by some popular means, with proofs fit to
. . . make a greater impression upon the minds of the multitude.” 29
Voltaire wrote to Cideville (April 12, 1756): “Geneva is no longer the
Geneva of Calvin— far from it; it is a land full of philosophers. The
‘reasonable Christianity’ of Locke is the religion of nearly all the
ministers; and the adoration of a Supreme Being, joined to a system of
morality, is the religion of nearly all the magis - trates.” 27 In the
Essai sur les moeurs (1756), after denouncing Calvin’s role in the
execution of Servetus, Voltaire added: “It seems that today an amende
honorable is made to the ashes of Servetus; the learned pastors of the
Protestant churches . . . have embraced his 〔Unitarian〕 sentiments.”
28 D’Alembert, after visiting Geneva a nd Les Delices (1756), talking
with some ministers, and comparing notes with Voltaire, wrote for Volume
VII (1757) of the Encyclopedic an article on Geneva in which he lauded
the liberalism of its clergy:</p>
<p>Several of them do not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ,
of</p>
<p>which their leader Calvin was so zealous a defender and for which he
had Servetus burned. . . . Hell, one of the principal points in our
be-</p>
<p>lief, is today no longer one for many of Geneva’s ministers; it
would, according to them, insult the Divinity to imagine that this
Being, full of goodness and justice, was capable of punishing our faults
by an eternity of torments. . . . They believe that there are
punishments in another</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>life, but for a time; thus purgatory, which was one of the
principal</p>
<p>causes of the separation of the Protestants from the Roman Church, is
today the only punishment many of them admit after death; here is a new
touch to add to the history of human contradictions.</p>
<p>To sum up in a word, many of Geneva’s pastors have no religion</p>
<p>other than a complete Socinianism, rejecting all those things which
are called mysteries, and imagining that the first principle of a true
religion is to propose nothing to belief which offends reason. . . .
Religion</p>
<p>has been practically reduced to the adoration of a single God, at
least among all those not of the common classes. 29</p>
<p>When the Genevan clergy read this article they were unanimously</p>
<p>alarmed — the conservatives to find such heretics in Calvinist
pulpits, the liberals to find their private heresies so publicly
exposed. The Company of Pastors examined the suspects; they warmly
repudiated d’Alembert’s alle - gations, and the Company issued a formal
reaffirmation of Calvinist ortho- doxy. 30</p>
<p>Calvin himself was part cause of the unseemly enlightenment praised
by d’Alembert, for the academy that he had founded was now one of the
finest educational establishments in Europe. It taught Calvinism, but
not too intensely; it gave excellent courses in classical literature,
and it trained good teachers for Geneva’s schools— with all expenses
borne by the state. A li- brary of 25,000 volumes lent books to the
public. D’Alembert found “the people much better educa ted than
elsewhere.” 31 Coxe was astonished to hear tradesmen discoursing
intelligently on literature and politics. Geneva, in this century,
contributed to science the work of Charles Bonnet in physi- ology and
psychology, and of Horace de Saussure in meteorology and geology. In art
it literally gave Jean Etienne Liotard to the world: after studying in
Geneva and Paris he went to Rome, where he portrayed Clement XII and
many cardinals; then to Constantinople, where he lived and worked for
five years, then to Vienna, Paris, England, and Holland, buttering his
bread with portraits, pastels, enamels, engravings and paint- ings on
glass. He drew a remarkably honest portrait of himself in old age, 32
looking more simian than Voltaire.</p>
<p>Geneva did not do well in literature. Alert censorship of print
stifled lit- erary ambition and originality. The drama was outlawed as a
nursery of scandal. When Voltaire in 1755 first staged a play — Zaire —
in the drawing room at Les Delices, the dergy grumbled, but tolerated
the crime as the private foible of a distinguished guest. When, however,
Voltaire organized a company of actors from among the young people of
Geneva, and pro- jected a series of dramatic performances, the
Consistory (July 31, 1755) called upon the Grand Conseil to enforce “the
decrees of 1732 and 1739 forbidding all representations of plays, as
well public as private,” and it</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>bade the pastors to forbid their parishioners to “play parts in
tragedies in the home of the Sieur de Voltaire.” Voltaire professed
repentance, but staged plays in his winter home at Lausanne. Probably at
his suggestion, d’Alembert introduced into the a foresaid article on
Geneva a plea for re- moval of the prohibition:</p>
<p>It is not because Geneva disapproves of dramas 〔spectacles〕 in
them- selves, but because (they say) it fears the taste for finery,
dissipation, and libertinage which theatrical companies spread among the
young. However, would it not be possible to remedy these disadvantages
by</p>
<p>laws severe and well enforced? . . . Literature would progress
with-</p>
<p>out increasing immorality, and Geneva would unite the wisdom of</p>
<p>Sparta with the culture of Athens.</p>
<p>The Consistory made no response to this appeal, but Jean Jacques
Rous- seau (as we shall see) replied to it in a famous Lettre a M.
d’Alembert sur les spectacles (1758). After buying the seigniory of
Ferney Voltaire by- passed the prohibition by building a theater at
Chatelaine, on French soil but close to the Genevan border. There he
produced plays, and secured for the opening Paris’ leading actor, Henri
L^uis Lekain. The Geneva pastors forbade attendance, but the
performances were so popular that on those oc- casions when Lekain was
to appear the pit was filled hours before the pro- gram began. The old
warrior at last won his campaign; in 1766 the Grand Conseil ended the
Genevan prohibition of plays.</p>

<p>An eyewitness of Lekain’s performance in Voltaire’s Semiramis de

<p>scribed the author’s appearance there:</p>
<p>Not the least part of the exhibition was Voltaire himself, seated</p>
<p>against a first wing, in view of all the audience, applauding like
one pos- sessed, now with his cane, now by exclamations — “It could not
be bet - ter! . . . Ah, mon Dieu, how well that was done!” … So little
was</p>
<p>he able to control his enthusiasm that when Lekain left the stage . .

<p>ined, for Voltaire resembled one of those old men of comedy — his</p>
<p>stockings rolled upon his knees, and dressed in the costume of
the</p>
<p>“good old times,” unable to sustain himself on his trembling limbs ex
- cept with the aid of a cane. All the marks of old age are imprinted
upon his countenance; his cheeks are hollow and wrinkled, his nose

<p>longed, his eyes almost extinguished. 33</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>Amid theatricals, politics, visitors, and gardening, he found time to
com- plete and publish at Les Delices two major works, one notorious for
al- leged indecency, the other marking a new epoch in the writing of
history.</p>
<p>La Pucelle had been with him, as a literary recreation, ever since
1730. Apparently he had no intention of publishing it, for it not only
made fun of the heroic Maid of Orleans, but satirized the creed, crimes,
rites, and dig- nitaries of the Catholic Church. Friends and enemies
added to the circulat- ing manuscripts bits of obscenity and hilarity
that even Voltaire would not have put upon paper. Now, in 1755, just as
he was finding peace in Geneva, there appeared in Basel a pirated and
garbled version of the poem. This was banned by the Pope, was burned by
the Paris Parlement, and was confis- cated by the Geneva police; a Paris
printer was sent to the galleys for reis- suing it in 1757. Voltaire
denied authorship; he sent to Richelieu, Mme. de Pompadour, and some
government officials copies of a relatively decent text; in 1762 he
published this, and suffered no molestation for it. He tried to atone to
Jeanne d’Arc by giving a fairer and soberer account of her in his Essai
sur les moeurs. Zi</p>
<p>That Essai was intended as his chef- d’oeuvre, and was also in one
sense a monument to the mistress whose memory he revered. He had
accepted as a challenge the contempt that Mme. du Chatelet had poured
upon such modem historians as she knew:</p>
<p>What does it matter to me, a Frenchwoman living on my estate, to</p>
<p>know that Egil succeeded Haquin in Sweden, and that Ottoman was the
son of Ortogrul? I have read with pleasure the history of the</p>
<p>Greeks and the Romans; they offered me certain great pictures which
attracted me. But I have never yet been able to finish any long history
of our modern nations. I can see scarcely anything in them but confu-
sion: a host of minute events without connection or sequence, a thou-
sand battles which settled nothing. … I renounced a study which</p>
<p>overwhelms the mind without illuminating it . 35</p>
<p>Voltaire agreed with her, but he knew that this was only history
as</p>
<p>’written. He mourned the diverse transmogrifications of the past by
current prejudices; in this sense “histo ry … is nothing but a pack of
tricks that we play upon the dead.” 36 * And yet to ignore history would
be to endlessly repeat its errors, massacres, and crimes. There are
three avenues to that large and tolerant perspective which is
philosophy: one is the study of men in life through experience; another,
the study of things in space through science; a third, the study of
events in time through history. Vol-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>taire had attempted the second by studying Newton; now he turned to
the third. As early as 1738 he laid down a new pr inciple: “// faut
ecrire</p>
<p>Fhistoire en philo sophe”— one must write history as a philosopher.
38 So he suggested to the Marquise:</p>
<p>If amid so much material rude and unformed you should choose</p>
<p>wherewith to construct an edifice for your own use; if, while leaving
out all the details of warfare, . . . all the petty negotiations
which</p>
<p>have been only useless knavery; … if, while preserving those details
that paint manners, you should form out of that chaos a general and
well-defined picture; if you should discover in events the history
of</p>
<p>the human mind, would you believe you had lost your time? 39</p>
<p>He worked on the project intermittently for twenty years, reading</p>
<p>voraciously, making references, gathering notes. In 1739 he drew up
for Mme. du Chatelet an Abrege de Fhistoire generate; in 1745-46 parts
of this were printed in Le Mercure de France; in 1750 he issued his
History of the Crusades; in 1753, at The Hague, the Abrege appeared in
two volumes, in 1754 in three; finally at Geneva in 1756 the full text
was published in seven volumes as Essai sur Fhistoire generate; this
contained Le Siecle de</p>
<p>Louis XIV and some preliminary chapters on Oriental civilizations. In
1762 he added a Precis du siecle de Louis XV. The edition of 1769 estab-
lished Essai sur les moeurs et F esprit des nations depuis Charlemagne
jusqu’d nos jours as the definitive title. The word moeurs meant not
only manners and morals but customs, ideas, beliefs, and laws. Voltaire
did not always cover all these topics, nor did he record the history of
scholarship, science, philosophy, or art; but in the large his book was
a brave approach to a his- tory of civilization from the earliest times
to his own. The Oriental portions were sketchy preludes; the fuller
account began with Charlemagne, where Bossuet’s Discours sur Fhistoire
universelle (1679) had left off. “I want to know,” wrote Voltaire, “what
were the steps by which men passed from barbarism to civilization”— by
which he meant the passage from the Middle Ages to “modem” times. 40</p>
<p>He gave credit to Bossuet for attempting a “universal history,” but
he protested against conceiving this as a history of the Jews and the
Christians, and of Greece and Rome chiefly in relation to Christianity.
He pounced u pon the bishop’s neglect of China and India, and his
conception of the</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>from superstition to reason. He could see no Providential design in
the maelstrom of events. Perhaps in reaction to Bossuet he made
organized re- ligion the villain in his story, since it seemed to him
generally allied with obscurantism, given to oppression, and fomenting
war. In his eagerness to discourage fanaticism and persecution Voltaire
weighted his narrative as heavily in one direction as Bossuet had in the
other.</p>
<p>In his new cosmopolitan perspective, made possible by the progress of
geography through the reports of explorers, missionaries, merchants, and
travelers, Europe assumed a more modest position in the panorama of his-
tory. Voltaire was impressed by “the collection of astronomical observa
- tions made during nineteen hundred successive years in Babylonia, and
transferred by Alexander to Greece”; 41 he concluded that there must
have been, along the Tigris and Euphrates, a widespread and developed
civiliza- tion, usually passed over with a sentence or two in such
histories as Bos- suet’s. Still more was he moved by the antiquity,
extent, and excellence of civilization in China; this, he thought,
“places the Chinese above all the other nations of the world. . . . Yet
this nation and India, the most ancient of extant states, . . . which
had invented nearly all the arts almost before we possessed any of them,
have always been omitted, down to our own time, in our pretended
universal histories .” 42 It pleased the anti -Christian warrior to find
and to present so many great cultures so long antedating Christianity,
quite unacquainted with the Bible, and yet producing artists, poets,
scientists, sages, and saints generations before the birth of Christ. It
delighted the irate, moneylending anti-Semite to reduce Judea to a very
small role in history.</p>
<p>He made some efforts to be fair to the Christians. In his pages not
all the popes are bad, not all the monks are parasites. He had a good
word for popes like Alexander III, “who abolished vassalage, . . .
restored the</p>
<p>rights of the people, and chastised the wickedness of crowned heads
”; 43 and he admired t he “consummate courage” of Julius II, and “the
grandeur of his views .” 44 He sympathized with the efforts of the
papacy to establish a moral power checking the wars of states and the
injustices of kings. He admitted that the bishops of the Church, after
the fall of the Western Ro- man Empire, were the ablest governors in
that disintegrating, reintegrating age. Moreover,</p>
<p>in those barbaric times, when the peoples were so wretched, it was a
great consolation to find in the cloisters a secure retreat against tyr-
anny . 45 … It cannot be denied that there were great virtues in the</p>
<p>cloister; there was hardly a monastery which did not contain
admirable beings who did honor to human nature. Too many writers have
made it a pleasure to search out the disorders and vices with which
these</p>
<p>refuges of piety were sometimes stained . 46</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>But by and large Voltaire, caught with the embattled Encyclopedists
in a war against the Catholic Church in France, emphasized the faults of
Christianity in history. He minimized the persecution of Christians by
Rome, and anticipated Gibbon in reckoning this as far less frequent and
murderous than the persecution of heretics by the Church. He gave an-
other lead to Gibbon in arguing that the new religion had weakened the
Roman state. He thought that priests had usurped power by propagating
absurd doctrines among ignorant and credulous people, and by using the
hypnotic power of ritual to deaden the mind and strengthen these delu-
sions. He charged that popes had extended their sway, and had amassed
wealth, by using documents such as the “Donation of Constantine,” now
generally admitted to be spurious. He declared that the Spanish
Inquisition and the massacre of the heretical Albigenses were the vilest
events in history.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages in Christendom seemed to him a desolate interlude be-
tween Julian and Rabelais; but he was among the first to recognize the
debt of European thought to Arab science, medicine, and philosophy. He
praised Louis IX as the ideal of a Christian king, but he saw no
nobility in Charlemagne, no sense in Scholasticism, no grandeur in the
Gothic cathe- drals, which he dismissed as “a fanta stic compound of
rudeness and fili- gree.” His hunted spirit could not be expected to
appreciate the work of the Christian creed and priesthood in forming
character and morals, pre- serving communal order and peace, promoting
nearly all the arts, inspiring majestic music, embellishing the life of
the poor with ceremony, festival, song, and hope. He was a man at war,
and a mm cannot fight well unless he has learned to hate. Only the
victor can appreciate his enemy.</p>
<p>Was he correct in his facts? Usually, but of course he made mistakes.
The Abbe Nonnotte published two volumes, Erreurs de Voltaire, and added
some of his own . 47 Robertson, himself a great historian, was im-
pressed by Voltaire’s general accuracy in so wide a field . 48 Covering
so many subjects in so many countries through so many centuries,
Voltaire made no pretense of confining himself to original documents or
contem- porary sources, but he used his secondary authorities with
discrimination and judicious weighing of the evidence. He made it a rule
to question any testimony that seemed to contradict “common sense” or
the general ex - perience of mankind. Doubtless he would have confessed
today that the incredibilities of one age may be accepted routine in the
next, but he laid it down as a guiding principle that “incredulity is
the foundation of all knowledge .” 49 So he anticipated Barthold Niebuhr
in rejecting the early chapters of Livy as legendary; he laughed
Romulus, Remus, and their alma mater wolf out of court; he suspected
Tacitus of vengeful exaggerations in describing the vices of Tiberius,
Claudius, Nero, and Caligula; he doubted</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV )</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>Herodotus and Suetonius as retailers of hearsay, and he thought
Plutarch too fond of anecdotes to be entirely reliable; but he accepted
Thucydides, Xenophon, and Polybius as trustworthy historians. He was
skeptical of monkish chronicles, but he praised Du Cange and the
“careful” Tillemont and the “profound” Mabillon. He refused to continue
the ancient custom of imaginary speeches, or the modern custom of
historical “portraits.” He subordinated the individual in the general
stream of ideas and events, and the only heroes he worshiped were those
of the mind.</p>
<p>In the Essai rnd elsewhere Voltaire suggested rather than formulated
his philosophy of history. He wrote a “Philosophic de l’histoire,” and
prefixed it to an edition of the Essai in 1765. He had an aversion to
“systems” of thoi ;ght, to all attempts to squeeze the universe into a
formula; he knew that facts have swcrn eternal enmity to
generalizations; and perhaps he felt that my philosophy of history
should follow and derive from, rather than precede and decide, the
recital of events. Some wide conclusions, however, emerged from his
narrative: that civilization preceded “Adam” and “the Creation” by many
thousands of years; that human nature is fundamentally the same in all
ages and lands, but is diversely modified by different cus- toms; that
climate, government, and religion are the basic determinants of these
variations; that the “empire of custom is far larger than that of na -
ture”; 50 that chance and accident (within the universal rul e of
natural laws) play an important role in generating events; that history
is made less by the genius of individuals than by the instinctive
operations of human multi- tudes upon their environment; that in this
way are produced, bit by bit, the manners, morals, economies, laws,
sciences, and arts that make a civili- zation and produce the spirit of
the times. “My principal end is always to observe the spirit of the
times, since it is that which directs the great events of the world.”
51</p>
<p>All in al l, as Voltaire saw it in his “Recapitulation,” history (as
generally written) was a bitter and tragic story.</p>
<p>I have now gone through the immense scene of revolutions that the
world has experienced since the time of Charlemagne; and to what</p>
<p>have they tended? To desolation, and the loss of millions of
lives!</p>
<p>Every great event has been a capital misfortune. History has kept no
account of times of peace and tranquillity; it relates only ravages and
disasters. . . . All history, in short, is little else than a long
succession of useless cruelties, … a collection of crimes, follies, and
misfortunes, among which we have now and then met with a few virtues,
and some happy times, as we see sometimes a few scattered huts in a
barren des- ert. … As nature has placed in the heart of man interest,
pride, and</p>
<p>all the passions, it is no wonder that . . . we meet with almost a
con- tinuous succession of crimes and disasters. 52</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>This is a very dyspeptic picture, as if composed amid those fretful
days in Berlin, or amid the indignities and frustrations of Frankfurt.
The picture might have been brighter if Voltaire had spent more of his
pages in report- ing the history of literature, science, philosophy, and
art. As the picture stands, one wonders why Voltaire went to so much
trouble to depict it at such length. He would have answered: to shock
the reader into conscience and thought, and to stir governments to
remold education and legislation to form better men. We cannot change
human nature, but we can modify its operations by saner customs and
wiser laws. If ideas have changed the world, why may not better ideas
make a better world? So, in the end, Vol- taire moderated his pessimism
with hope for the dissemination of reason as a patient agent in the
progress of mankind.</p>
<p>The faults of the Essai sur les moeurs were soon pointed out. Not
only Nonnotte but Larcher, Guenee, and many others pounced upon its
errors of fact, and the Jesuits had no trouble in exposing its
distorting bias. Mon- tesquieu agreed with them in this regard;
“Voltaire,” he said, “is like the monks who write not for the sake of
the subject that they treat, but for the glory of their order; he writes
for his convent .” 53 Voltaire replied to his critics that he had
stressed the sins of Christianity because others were still defending
them; he quoted contemporary authors who commended the crusades against
the Albigenses, the execution of Huss, even the Massacre of
St. Bartholomew; the world surely needed a history that would brand
these actions as crimes against humanity and morality . 54 — Perhaps,
with all his illuminating conception of how history should be written,
Voltaire mistook the function of the historian; he sat in judgment on
each person and event, and passed sentence on them like some Committee
of Public Safety pledged to protect and advance the intellectual
revolution. And he judged men not in terms of their own disordered time
and restricted knowledge, but in the light of the wider knowledge that
had come since their death. Written sporadically over a score of years,
amid so many dis- tracting enterprises and tribulations, the Essai
lacked continuity of narra- tive and unity of form, and it did not quite
integrate its parts into a con- sistent whole.</p>
<p>But the merits of the Essai were numberless. Its range of knowledge
was immense, and testified to sedulous research. Its bright style,
weighted with philosophy and lightened with humor, raised it far above
most works of history between Tacitus and Gibbon. Its general spirit
alleviated its bias; the book is still warm with love of liberty,
toleration, justice, and reason. Here again, after so many lifeless,
credulous chronicles, historiography be- came an art. In one generation
three more histories transformed past events into literature and
philosophy: Hume’s History of England, Robertson’s History of the Reign
of the E mperor Charles V, Gibbon’s Decline and Fall</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV)</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>of the Roman Empire — all of them indebted to the spirit, and in part
to the example, of Voltaire. Michelet wrote gratefully of the Essai as
“this His - tory which made all historiography, which begot all of us,
critics and nar- rators alike.” 55 And what are we doing here but
walking in the path of Voltaire?</p>
<p>When the Seven Years’ War ranged France against Frederick, Voltaire’s
latent love of his country rose again, perhaps mingled with old memories
of Frankfurt and a new distrust of Geneva. After d’Alembert’s article,
and the retreat of the Geneva clergy from the audacities to which it had
pledged them, Voltaire felt as unsafe in Switzerland as in France. When
could he return to his native soil?</p>
<p>For once fortune favored him. The Due de Choiseul, who enjoyed the
exile’s books, became minister of foreign affairs in 1758; Mme. de Pompa
- dour, though in physical decline, was at the height of her influence,
and had forgiven Voltaire’s gaucheries; now the French government, while
the King dallied in his seraglio, could wink at the terrible heretic’s
re -entry into France. In October, 1758, he moved three and a half miles
out of Switzerland, and became the patriarch of Ferney. He was
sixty-four and still near death; but he ranged himself against the
strongest power in Europe in the most basic conflict of the century.</p>
