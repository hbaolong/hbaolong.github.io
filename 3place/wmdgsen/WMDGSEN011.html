<p>I. THE INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES</p>
<p>The ethnic scene — Mitannians — Hittites — Armenians — Scythians —
Phrygians — The Divine Mother — Lydians — Croesus — Coin-</p>
<p>age — Croesus, Solon and Cyrus</p>
<p>T O a distant and yet discerning eye the Near East, in the days
of</p>
<p>Nebuchadrezzar, would have seemed like an ocean in which vast</p>
<p>swarms of human beings moved about in turmoil, forming and dissolving
groups, enslaving and being enslaved, eating and being eaten, killing
and getting killed, endlessly. Behind and around the great empires —
Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria and Persia — flowered this medley of half
nomad, half settled tribes: Cimmerians, Cilicians, Cappadocians,
Bithynians, Ashkanians, Mysians, Maeonians, Carians, Lycians,
Pamphylians, Pisidians, Lycaonians, Philistines, Amorites, Canaanites,
Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites and a hundred other peoples each of which
felt itself the center of geography and history, and would have marveled
at the ignorant prejudice of an historian who would reduce them to a
paragraph. Thoughout the history of the Near East such nomads were a
peril to the more settled kingdoms which they almost surrounded;
periodically droughts would fling them upon these richer regions,
necessitating frequent wars, and perpetual readiness for war. 1 Usually
the nomad tribe survived the settled kingdom, and overran it in the end.
The world is dotted with areas where once civilization flourished, and
where nomads roam again.</p>
<p>In this seething ethnic sea certain minor states took shape, which,
even if only as conductors, contributed their mite to the heritage of
the race. The Mitannians interest us not as the early antagonists of
Egypt in the Near East, but as one of the first Indo-European peoples
known to us in Asia, and as the worshipers of gods — Mithra, Indra and
Varuna — whose pas-</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>286 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>sage to Persia and India helps us to trace the movements of what was
once so conveniently called the “Aryan” race.* * * §</p>
<p>The Hittites were among the most powerful and civilized of the early
Indo-European peoples. Apparently they had come down across the Bos-
phorus, the Hellespont, the iEgean or the Caucasus, and had established
themselves as a ruling military caste over the indigenous agriculturists
of that mountainous peninsula, south of the Black Sea, which we know as
Asia Minor. Towards 1800 b.c. we find them settled near the sources of
the Tigris and the Euphrates; thence they spread their arms and
influence into Syria, and gave mighty Egypt some indignant concern. We
have seen how Rameses II was forced to make peace with them, and to
acknowledge the Hittite king as his equal. At Boghaz Keuit they made
their capital and centered their civilization: first on the iron which
they mined in the moun- tains bordering on Armenia, then on a code of
laws much influenced by Hammur abi’s, and finally on a crude esthetic
sense which drove them to carve vast and awkward figures in the round,
or upon the living rock4 Their language, recently deciphered by Hronzny
from the ten thousand clay tablets found at Boghaz Keui by Hugo
Winckler, was largely of Indo-Euro- pean affinity; its declensional and
conjugational forms closely resembled those of Latin and Greek, and some
of its simpler words are visibly akin to English. § The Hittites wrote a
pictographic script in their own queer way — one line from left to
right, the next from right to left, and so forth alternately. They
learned cuneiform from the Babylonians, taught Crete</p>
<ul>
<li>The word Aryan first appears in the Harri, one of the tribes of
Mitanni. In general it was the self-given appellation of peoples living
near, or coming from, the shores of the Caspian Sea. The term is
properly applied today chiefly to the Mitannians, Hittites, Medes,
Persians, and Vedic Hindus — i.e., only to the eastern branch of the
Indo-European peoples, whose western branch populated Europe. 2</li>
</ul>
<p>fEast of the Halys River. Nearby, across the river, is Angora,
capital of Turkey, and lineal descendant of Ancyra, the ancient
metropolis of Phrygia. We may be helped to a cultural perspective by
realizing th at the Turks, whom we call “terrible,” note with pride the
antiquity of their capital, and mourn the domination of Europe by
barbaric infidels. Every point is the center of the world.</p>
<p>$ Baron von Oppenheim unearthed at Tell Halaf and elsewhere many
relics of Hittite art, which he has collected into his own museum, an
abandoned factory in Berlin. Most of these remains are dated by their
finder about 1200 b.c.; some of them he attributes pre- cariously to the
fourth millennium b.c. The collection includes a group of lions crudely
but powerfully carved in stone, a bull in fine black stone, and figures
of the Hittite triad of gods — the Sun-god, the Weather-god, and Hepat,
the Hittite Ishtar. One of the most impressive of the figures is an
ungainly Sphinx, before which is a stone vessel intended for
offerings.</p>
<p>§ Cf., e.g., vadar, water; ezza, eat; uga, I (Latin ego ) ; tug ,
thee; vesh, we; mu, me; kuish, who (Lat. quis ) ; quit, what (Lat.
quid), etc. 8</p>

<p>he use of the clay tablet for writing, and seem to have mingled with
the ancient Hebrews intimately enough to have given them their sharply
aquiline nose, so that this Hebraic feature must now be considered
strictly “Aryan.” 4 Some of the surviving tablets are vocabularies
giving Sumerian, Babylonian and Hittite equivalents; others are
administrative enactments re- vealing a close-knit military and
monarchical state; others contain two hun- dred fragments of a code of
laws, including price-regulations for commodi- ties. 6 The Hittites
disappeared from history almost as mysteriously as they entered it; one
after another their capitals decayed — perhaps because their great
advantage, iron, became equally accessible to their competitors. The
last of these capitals, Carchemish, fell before the Assyrians in 717
b.c.</p>
<p>Just north of Assyria was a comparatively stable nation, known to the
Assyrians as Urartu, to the Hebrews as Ararat, and to later times as Ar-
menia. For many centuries, beginning before the dawn of recorded history
and continuing till the establishment of Persian rule over all of
western Asia, the Armenians maintained their independent government,
their char- acteristic customs and arts. Under their greatest king,
Argistis II (ca. 708 b.c.) , they grew rich by mining iron and selling
it to Asia and Greece; they achieved a high level of prosperity and
comfort, of culture and manners; they built great edifices of stone, and
made excellent vases and statuettes. They lost their wealth in costly
wars of offense and defense against Assyria, and passed under Persian
domination in the days of the all-conquering Cyrus.</p>
<p>Still farther north, along the shores of the Black Sea, wandered
the</p>
<p>Scythians, a horde of warriors half Mongol and half European,
ferocious bearded giants who lived in wagons, kept their women in purdah
seclusion, 6 rode bareback on wild horses, fought to live and lived to
fight, drank the blood of their enemies and used the scalps as napkins,
7 weakened Assyria with repeated raids, swept through western Asia (ca.
630-610 b.c.), de- stroying and killing everything and everyone in their
path, advanced to the very cities of the Egyptian Delta, were suddenly
decimated by a mys- terious disease, and were finally overcome by the
Medes and driven back to their northern haunts. 8 * We catch from such a
story another glimpse of the barbaric hinterland that hedged in every
ancient state.</p>

<li>Hippocrates tells us that “their women, so long as they are virgins,
ride, shoot, throw</li>
</ul>
<p>*88 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>Towards the end of the ninth century b.c. a new power arose in Asia
Minor, inheriting the remains of the Hittite civilization, and serving
as a cultural bridge to Lydia and Greece. The legend by which the
Phrygians tried to explain for curious historians the foundation of
their kingdom was symbolical of the rise and fall of nations. Their
first king, Gordios, was a simple peasant whose sole inheritance had
been a pair of oxen;* their next king, his son Midas, was a spendthrift
who weakened the state by that greed and extravagance which posterity
represented through the legend of his plea to the gods that he might
turn anything to gold by touching it. The plea was so well heard that
everything Midas touched turned to gold, even the food that he put to
his lips; he was on the verge of starvation when the gods allowed him to
cleanse himself of the curse by bathing in the river Pactolus — which
has given up grains of gold</p>
<p>ever since.</p>
<p>The Phrygians made their way into Asia from Europe, built a
capital</p>
<p>at Ancyra, and for a time contended with Assyria and Egypt for
mastery of the Near East. They adopted a native mother-goddess, Ma,
rechristened her Cybele from the mountains ( kybela ) in which she
dwelt, and wor- shiped her as the great spirit of the untilled earth,
the personification of all the reproductive energies of nature. They
took over from the aborig- ines the custom of serving the goddess
through sacred prostitution, and accepted into their mythical lore the
story of how Cybele had fallen in love with the young god Atys,f and had
compelled him to emasculate himself in her honor; hence the priests of
the Great Mother sacrificed their manhood to her upon entering the
service of her temples. 11 These barbarous legends fascinated the
imagination of the Greeks, and entered profoundly into their mythology
and their literature. The Romans offi- cially adopted Cybele into their
religion, and some of the orgiastic rites that marked the Roman
carnivals were derived from the wild rituals with which the Phrygians
annually celebrated the death and resurrection of the handsome Atys.
13</p>
<p>•The oracle of Zeus had commanded the Phrygians to choose as king the
first man who rode up to the temple in a wagon; hence the selection of
Gordios. The new king dedicated his car to the god; and a new oracle
predicted that the man who should suc- ceed in untying the intricate
bark knot that bound the yoke of the wagon to the pole would rule over
all Asia. Alexander, story goes, cut the “Gordian knot” with a blow of
his sword.</p>
<p>Atys, we are informed, was miraculously bom of the virgin-goddess
Nana, who con- ceived him by placing a pomegranate between her breasts.
10</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) A MOTLEY OF NATIONS 289</p>
<p>The ascendency of Phrygia in Asia Minor was ended with the rise</p>
<p>of the new kingdom of Lydia. King Gyges established it with its
capital at Sardis; Alyattes, in a long reign of forty-nine years, raised
it to pros- perity and power; Croesus (570-546 b.c.) inherited and
enjoyed it, ex- panded it by conquest to include nearly all of Asia
Minor, and then sur- rendered it to Persia. By generous bribes to local
politicians he brought one after another of the petty states that
surrounded him into subjection to Lydia, and by pious and unprecedented
hecatombs to local deities he placated these subject peoples and
persuaded them that he was the darling of their gods. Croesus further
distinguished himself by issuing gold and silver coins of admirable
design, minted and guaranteed at their face value by the state; and
though these were not, as long supposed, the first official coins in
history, much less the invention of coinage,* never- theless they set an
example that stimulated trade throughout the Mediter- ranean world. Men
had for many centuries used various metals as stand- ards of value and
exchange; but these, whether copper, bronze, iron, silver or gold, had
in most countries been measured by weight or other tests at each
transaction. It was no small improvement that replaced such cumbersome
tokens with a national currency; by accelerating the passage of goods
from those that could best produce them to those that most effectively
demanded them it added to the wealth of the world, and pre- pared for
mercantile civilizations like those of Ionia and Greece, in which the
proceeds of commerce were to finance the achievements of literature and
art.</p>
<p>Of Lydian literatare nothing remains; nor does any specimen survive
of the preciously wrought vases of gold, iron and silver that Croesus
offered to the conquered gods. The vases found in Lydian tombs, and now
housed in the Louvre, show how the artistic leadership of Egypt and
Babylonia was yielding, in the Lydia of Croesus’ day, to the growing
influence of Greece; their delicacy of execution rivals their fidelity
to nature. When Herodotus visited Lydia he found its customs almost in-
distinguishable from those of his fellow-Greeks; all that remained to
sep- arate them, he tells us, was the way in which the daughters of the
com- mon people earned their dowries — by prostitution. 13</p>
<p>The same great gossip is our chief authority for the dramatic
story</p>
<p>of Croesus’s fall. Herodotus recou nts how Croesus displayed his
riches</p>
<ul>
<li>Older coins have been found at Mohenjo-daro, in India (2900 and we
have seen how Sennacherib (ca. 700 b.c.) minted half-shekel pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>290 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>o Solon, and then asked him whom he considered the happiest of men.
Solon, after naming three individuals who were all dead, refused to call
Croesus happy, on the ground that there was no telling what misfortunes
the morrow would bring him. Croesus dismissed the great legislator as a
fool, turned his hand to plotting against Persia, and suddenly found the
hosts of Cyrus at his gates. According to the same historian the
Persians won through the superior stench of their camels, which the
horses of the Lydian cavalry could not bear; the horses fled, the
Lydians were</p>
<p>routed, and Sardis fell. Croesus, according to ancient tradition,
prepared a great funeral pyre, took his place on it with his wives, his
daughters, and the noblest young men among the surviving citizens, and
ordered his eunuchs to burn himself and them to death. In his last
moments he re- membered the words of Solon, mourned his own blindness,
and re- proached the gods who had taken all his hecatombs and paid him
with destruction. Cyrus, if we may follow Herodotus, 1 * took pity on
him, ordered the flames to be extinguished, carried Croesus with him to
Persia, and made him one of his most trusted counsellors.</p>
<p>II, THE SEMITIC PEOPLES</p>
<p>The antiquity of the Arabs — Phoenicians — Their ’world trade —</p>
<p>Their circumnavigation of Africa — Colonies — Tyre and</p>
<p>Sidon — Deities — The dissemination of the alphabet —</p>
<p>Syria — Astarte — The death and resurrection of</p>
<p>Adoni — The sacrifice of children</p>
<p>If we attempt to mitigate the confusion of tongues in the Near
East</p>
<p>by distinguishing the northern peoples of the region as mostly Indo-
European, and the central and southern peoples, from Assyria to Arabia,
as Semitic,* we shall have to remember that reality is never so
clear-cut in its differences as the rubrics under which we dismember it
for neat handling. The Near East was divided by mountains and deserts
into</p>
<p>localities naturally isolated and therefore naturally diverse in
language and traditions; but not only did trade tend to assimilate
language, customs and arts along its main routes (as, for example, along
the great rivers from Nineveh and Carchemish to the Persian Gulf), but
the migrations and imperial deportations of vast communities so mingled
stocks and speech</p>
<p>•The term Semite is derived from Shem, legendary s on of Noah, on the
theory that Shem was the ancestor of all the Semitic peoples.</p>
<p>CHAP. XI ) A MOTLEY OF NATIONS 2$&gt;I</p>
<p>hat a certain homogeneity of culture accompanied the heterogeneity of
blood. By “Indo - European,” then, we shall mean predominantly Indo-
European; by “Semitic” we shall mean predominantly Semitic: no strain
was unmixed, no culture was left uninfluenced by its neighbors or its
enemies. We are to vision the vast area as a scene of ethnic diversity
and flux, in which now the Indo-European, now the Semitic, stock for
a</p>
<p>ime prevailed, but only to take on the general cultural character of
the whole. Hammurabi and Darius I were separated by differences of blood
and religion, and by almost as many centuries as those that divide us
from Christ; nevertheless, when we examine the two great kings we
perceive that they are essentially and profoundly akin.</p>
<p>The fount and breeding-place of the Semites was Arabia. Out of that
arid region, where the “man - plant” grows so vigorously and hardl y any
other plant will grow at all, came, in a succession of migrations, wave
after wave of sturdy, reckless stoics no longer supportable by desert
and oases, and bound to conquer for themselves a place in the shade.
Those who remained behind created the civilization of Arabia and the
Bedouin: the patriarchal family, the stern morality of obedience, the
fatalism of a hard environment, and the ignorant courage to kill their
own daughters as offerings to the gods. Nevertheless they did not take
religion very much to heart till Mohammed came, and they neglected the
arts and re- finements of life as effeminate devices for degenerate men.
For a time they controlled the trade with the further East: their ports
at Canneh and Aden were heaped with the riches of the Indies, and their
patient caravans carried these goods precariously overland to Phoenicia
and Babylon. In the interior of their broad peninsula they built cities,
palaces and temples, but they did not encourage foreigners to come and
see them. For thou- sands of years they have lived their own life, kept
their own customs, kept their own counsel; they are the same today as in
the time of Cheops and Gudea; they have seen a hundred kingdoms rise and
fall about them; and their soil is still jealously theirs, guarded from
profane feet and alien eyes.</p>
<p>Who, now, were those Phoenicians who have so often been spoken of in
these pages, whose ships sailed every sea, whose merchants bar- gained
in every port? The historian is abashed before any question of origins:
he must confess that he knows next to nothing about either the early or
the late history of this ubiquitous, yet elusive, people. 18 We do not
know whence they came, nor when; we are not certain that they</p>
<p>292 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>were Semites;* and as to the date of their arrival on the
Mediterranean coast, we cannot contradict the statement of the scholars
of Tyre, who told Herodotus that their ancestors had come from the
Persian Gulf, and had founded the city in what we should call the
twenty-eighth century before Christ. 17 Even their name is
problematical: the phoinix from which the Greeks coined it may mean the
red dye that Tyrian merchants sold, or a palm-tree that flourishes along
the Phoenician coast. That coast, a narrow strip a hundred miles long
and only ten miles wide, between Syria and the sea, was almost all of
Phoenicia; the people never thought it worth while to settle in the
Lebanon hills behind them, or to bring these ranges under their rule;
they were content that this beneficent barrier should protect them from
the more warlike nations whose goods they carried out into all the lanes
of the sea.</p>
<p>Those mountains compelled them to live on the water. From the Sixth
Egyptian Dynasty onward they were the busiest merchants of the ancient
world; and when they liberated themselves from Egypt (ca. 1200 b.c.)
they became masters of the Mediterranean. They themselves manufac- tured
various forms and objects of glass and metal; they made enameled vases,
weapons, ornaments and jewelry; they had a monopoly of the purple dye
which they extracted from the molluscs abounding along their</p>
<p>shores ; 18 and the women of Tyre were famous for the gorgeous colors
with which they stained the products of their deft needlework. These,
and the exportable surplus of India and the Near East — cereals, wines,
textiles and precious stones — they shipped to every city of the
Mediter- ranean far and near, bringing back, in return, lead, gold and
iron from the south shores of the Black Sea, copper, cypress and corn
from Cyprus, f ivory from Africa, silver from Spain, tin from Britain,
and slaves from everywhere. They were shrewd traders; they persuaded the
natives of Spain to give them, in exchange for a cargo of oil, so great
a quantity of silver that the holds of their ships could not contain it
— whereupon the subtle Semites replaced the iron or stones in their
anchors with silver, and sailed prosperously away. 18 Not satisfied with
this, they enslaved the na- tives, and made them work for long hours in
the mines for a subsistence wage.| Like all early voyagers, and some old
languages, they made scant</p>
<p>Autran has argued that they were a branch of the Cretan civilization.

<p>Cf. Gibbon: “Spain, by a very singular fatality, was the Peru and

the Phoenicians, and the oppres-</p>

<p>distinction between trade and treachery, commerce and robbery; they
stole from the weak, cheated the stupid, and were honest with the rest.
Sometimes they captured ships on the high seas, and confiscated their
cargoes and their crews; sometimes they lured curious natives into
visiting the Phoenician vessels, and then sailed off with them to sell
them as slaves. 21 They had much to do with giving the trading Semites
of antiquity an evil reputation, especially with the early Greeks, who
did the same things.*</p>
<p>Their low and narrow galleys, some seventy feet long, set a new style
of design by abandoning the inward-curving bow of the Egyptian vessel,
and turning it outward into a sharp point for cleaving wind or water, or
the ships of the enemy. One large rectangular sail, hoisted on a mast
fixed in the keel, helped the galley-slaves who provided most of the
motive-power with their double bank of oars. On a deck above the</p>
<p>rowers, soldiers stood on guard, ready for trade or war. These
frail</p>
<p>ships, having no compasses and drawing hardly five feet of water,</p>
<p>kept cautiously near the shore, and for a long time dared not move
during the night. Gradually the art of navigation developed to the point
where the Phoenician pilots, guiding themselves by the North Star (or
the</p>
<p>Phoenician Star, as the Greeks called it), adventured into the
oceans, and at last circumnavigated Africa, sailing down the east coast
first, and “discovering” the Cape of Good Hope some two thousand years
before Vasco da Gama. “When autumn came,” says Herodotus, “they went</p>
<p>ashore, sowed the land, and waited for harvest; then, having reaped
the corn, they put to sea again. When two years had thus passed, in the
third, having doubled the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar), they arrived
in Egypt.” 23 What an adventure!</p>
<p>At strategic points along the Mediterranean they established
garrisons that grew in time into populous colonies or cities: at Cadiz,
Carthage and Marseilles, in Malta, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, even in
distant England. They occupied Cyprus, Melos and Rhodes. 24 They took
the arts and sciences of Egypt, Crete and the Near East and spread them
in Greece, Africa, Italy and Spain. They bound together the East and</p>
<p>sion of the simple natives, who were compelled to labor in their own
mines for the benefit of the strangers, form an exact type of the more
recent history of Spanish America.” 90</p>

the name “Phoenician” to anyone addicted to sharp practices. 2 2</li>

<p>294 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>he West in a commercial and cultural web, and began to redeem Europe
from barbarism.</p>
<p>Nourished by this trade, and skilfully governed by mercantile
aristocra- cies too clever in diplomacy and finance to waste their
fortunes in war, the cities of Phoenicia rose to a place among the
richest and most powerful in the world. Byblos thought itself the oldest
of all cities; the god El had founded it at the beginning of time, and
to the end of its history it re- mained the religious capital of
Phoenicia. Because papyrus was one of the principal articles in its
trade, the Greeks took the name of the city as their word for book —
biblos — and from their word for books named our Bible — ta biblia.</p>
<p>Some fifty miles to the south, also on the coast, lay Sidon;
originally a fortress, it grew rapidly into a village, a town, a
prosperous city; it con- tributed the best ships to Xerxes’ fleet; and
when later the Persians be - sieged and captured it, its proud leaders
deliberately burned it to the ground, forty thousand inhabitants
perishing in the conflagration. 25 It was already rebuilt and
flourishing when Alexander came, and some of its en- terprising
merchants followed his army to India “for trafficking.” 20</p>
<p>Greatest of the Phoenician cities was Tyre — i.e., the rock — built
upon an island several miles off the coast. It, too, began as a
fortress; but its splen- did harbor and its security from attack soon
made it the metropolis of Phoenicia, a cosmopolitan bedlam of merchants
and slaves from the whole Mediterranean world. Already in the ninth
century b.c., Tyre had achieved affluence under King Hiram, friend of
King Solomon; and by the time of Zechariah (ca. 520 b.c.), she had
“heaped up silver as the dus t, and fine gold as the mire of the
streets.” 27 “The houses here,” said Strabo, “have many stories, even
more than the houses at Rome.” 23 Its wealth and courage kept it
independent until Alexander came. The young god saw in it a challenge to
his omnipotence, and reduced it by building a causeway that turned the
island into a peninsula. The success of Alexandria completed the ruin of
Tyre.</p>
<p>Like every nation that feels the complexity of cosmic currents and
the variety of human needs, Phoenicia had many gods. Each city had its
Baal (i.e., Lord) or city-god, who was conceived as ancestor of the
kings, and source of the soil’s fertility; the corn, the wine, the figs
and the flax were</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) A MOTLEY OF NATIONS 295</p>
<p>some places as the goddess of a cold Artemisian chastity, and in
others as the amorous and wanton deity of physical love, in which form
she was identified by the Greeks with Aphrodite. As Ishtar-Mylitta
received in sacri- fice the virginity of her girl-devotees at Babylon,
so the women who hon- ored Astarte at Byblos had to give up their long
tresses to her, or surrender themselves to the first stranger who
solicited their love in the precincts of the temple. And as Ishtar had
loved Tammuz, so Astarte had loved Adoni (i.e., Lord), whose death on
the tusks of a boar was annually mourned at Byblos and Paphos (in
Cyprus) with wailing and beating of the breast. Luckily Adoni rose from
the dead as often as he died, and ascended to heav- en in the presence
of his worshipers. 28 Finally there was Moloch (i.e., King), the
terrible god to whom the Phoenicians offered living children as burnt
sacrifices; at Carthage, during a siege of the city (307 b.c.), two
hundred boys of the best families were burned to death on the altar of
this fiery divinity.“</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Phoenicians deserve some niche in the hall of
civilized nations, for it was probably their merchants who taught the
Egyptian alphabet to the nations of antiquity. Not the ecstasies of
literature but the needs of commerce brought unity to the peoples of the
Mediterranean; nothing could better illustrate a certain generative
relation between commerce and culture. We do not know that the
Phoenicians introduced this alphabet into Greece, though Greek tradition
unanimously affirms it” it is possible that Crete gave the alphabet to
both the Phoenicians and the Greeks.” But it is more probable that the
Phoenicians took letters where they took papyrus. About noo b.c. we find
them importing</p>
<p>papyrus from Egypt;“ for a nation that kept and carried many accounts
it was an inestimable convenience compared with the heavy clay tablets
of Mesopotamia; and the Egyptian alphabet was likewise an immense
improvement upon the clumsy syllabaries of the Near East. About 960 b.c.
King Hiram of Tyre dedicated to one of his gods a bronze cup en- graved
with an alphabetic inscription;“ and about 840 b.c. King Mesha of Moab
announced his glory (on a stone now in the Louvre) in a</p>
<p>Semitic dialect written from right to left in letters corresponding
to</p>
<p>hose of the Phoenician alphabet. The Greeks reversed the facing of
some of the letters, because they wrote from left to right; but
essentially their alphabet was that which the Phoenicians had taught
them, and which they were in turn to teach to Europe. These strange
symbols</p>
<p>are the most precious portion of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>29 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>The oldest examples of alphabetic writing known to us, however,
appear not in Phoenicia but in Sinai. At Serabit-el-khadim, a little
hamlet covering a site where anciently the Egyptians mined turquoise,
Sir William Flinders Petrie found inscriptions in a strange language,
dating back to an uncertain age, perhaps as early as 2500 b.c. Though
these inscriptions have never been deciphered, it is apparent that they
were written not in hieroglyphics, nor in syllabic cuneiform, but with
an alphabet. 35 At Zapouna, in southern Syria, French archeologists
discovered an entire library of clay tablets — some in hieroglyphic,
some in a Semitic alphabetic script. As Zapouna seems to have been
permanently destroyed about 1200 b.c., these tablets go back presumably
to the thirteenth century b.c.,“ and suggest to us again how old
civilization was in those centuries to which our ignorance ascribes its
origins.</p>
<p>Syria lay behind Phoenicia, in the very lap of the Lebanon hills,
gath- ering its tribes together loosely under the rule of that capital
which still boasts that it is the oldest city of all, and still harbors
Syrians hungry for liberty. For a time the kings of Damascus dominated a
dozen petty</p>
<p>nations about them, and successfully resisted the efforts of Assyria
to make Syria one of her vassal states. The inhabitants of the city were
Semitic merchants, who managed to garner wealth out of the caravan trade
that passed through Syria’s mountains and plains. Artisans and slaves
worked for them, none too happily. We hear of masons organizing great
unions, and inscriptions tell of a strike of bakers in Magnesia; across
the centuries we sense the strife and busyness of an ancient Syrian
town.” These</p>
<p>artisans were skilful in shaping graceful pottery, in carving ivory
and wood, in polishing gems, and in weaving stuffs of gay colors for
the</p>
<p>adornment of their women. 38</p>
<p>Fashions, manners and morals in Damascus were very much as at</p>
<p>Babylon, which was the Paris and arbiter elegantiarum of the ancient
East. Religious prostitution flourished, for in Syria, as throughout
western Asia, the fertility of the soil was symbolized in a Great
Mother, or</p>
<p>Goddess, whose sexual commerce with her lover gave the hint to all
the reproductive processes and energies of nature; and the sacrifice of
virginity at the temples was not only an offering to Astarte, but a par-
ticipation with her in that annual self-abandonment which, it was hoped,
would offer an irresistible suggestion to the earth, and insure the
increase of plants, animals and men. 38 About the time of the vernal
equinox the festival of the Syrian Astarte, like that of Cybele in
Phrygia, was cele-</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl) A MOTLEY OF NATIONS 297</p>
<p>brated at Hierapolis with a fervor bordering upon madness. The noise
of flutes and drums mingled with the wailing of the women for Astarte’s
dead lord, Adoni; eunuch priests danced wildly, and slashed themselves
with knives; at last many men, who had come merely as spectators, were
overcome with the excitement, threw off their clothing, and emasculated
themselves in pledge of lifelong service to the goddess. Then, in the
dark of the night, the priests brought a mystic illumination to the
scene, opened the tomb of the young god, and announced triumphantly that
Adoni, the Lord, had risen from the dead. Touching the lips of the
worshipers with balm, the priests whispered to them the promise that
they, too, would some day rise from the grave.“</p>
<p>The other gods of Syria were not less bloodthirsty than Astarte. It
is true that the priests recognized a general divinity, embracing all
the gods, and called El or flu, like the Elohim of the Jews; but this
calm abstraction was hardly noticed by the people who gave their worship
to the Baal. Usually they identified this city-god with the sun, as they
identified</p>
<p>Astarte with the moon; and on occasions of great moment they offered
him their own children in sacrifice, after the manner of the
Phoenicians; the parents came to the ceremony dressed as for a festival,
and the cries of their children burning in the lap of. the god were
drowned by the blaring of trumpets and the piping of flutes. Normally,
however, a milder sacrifice sufficed; the priests slashed themselves
until the altar was covered with their blood; or the child’s foreskin
was offered as a commutation for his life; or the priests condescended
to accept a sum of money to be presented to the god in place of the
prepuce. In some way the god had to be appeased and satisfied; for his
worshipers had made him in the image and dream of themselves, and he had
no great regard for human life, or womanly tears.“</p>
<p>Similar customs, varying only in name and detail, were practised
by</p>
<p>he Semitic tribes south of Syria, who filled the land with their
confusion of tongues. It was forbidden the Jews to “make their children
pass</p>
<p>hrough the fire ,” but occasionally they did it none the less.“
Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac, and Agamemnon sacrificing Iphigenia,
were but resorting to an ancient rite in attempting to propitiate the
gods with human blood. Mesha, King of Moab, sacrificed his eldest son by
fire as a means of raising a siege; his prayer having been answered, and
the sacrifice of his son having been accepted, he slaughtered seven
thousand Israelites in gratitude.“ Throughout this region, from the
Sumerian days</p>
<p>298 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>when the Amorites roamed the plains of Amurru (ca. 2800 b.c.) to the
time when the Jews fell with divine wrath upon the Canaanites, and
Sargon of Assyria captured Samaria, and Nebuchadrezzar captured Jeru-
salem (597 b.c.), the valley of the Jordan was drenched periodically</p>
<p>with fratricidal blood, and many Lords of Hosts rejoiced. These
Moabites, Canaanites, Amorites, Edomites, Philistines and Aramaeans
hardly enter *.ito the cultural record of mankind. It is true that the
fertile Aramaeans, spreading everywhere, made their language the lingua
franca of the Near East, and that the alphabetic script which they had
learned either from the Egyptians or the Phoenicians replaced the
cuneiform and syllabaries of Mesopotamia, first as a mercantile, then as
a literary, medium, and became at last the tongue of Christ and the
alphabet of the Arabs today.“ But time preserves their names not so much
because of their own accom- plishments as because they played some part
on the tragic stage of Pales- tine. We must study, in greater detail
than their neighbors, these numer- ically and geographically
insignificant Jews, who gave to the world one of its greatest
literatures, two of its most influential religions, and so many of its
profoundest men.</p>
