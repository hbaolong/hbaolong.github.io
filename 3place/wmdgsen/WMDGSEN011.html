<p>XAssyria</p>
<p>I. CHRONICLES</p>
<p>Beginnings — Cities — Race — The conquerors — Sennacherib and</p>
<p>Esarhaddon — “ Sardanapalus ”</p>
<p>M EANWHILE, three hundred miles north of Babylon, another</p>
<p>civilization had appeared. Forced to maintain a hard military
life</p>
<p>by the mountain tribes always threatening it on every side, it had in
time overcome its assailants, had conquered its parent cities in Elam,
Sumeria, Akkad and Babylonia, had mastered Phoenicia and Egypt, and had
for two centuries dominated the Near East with brutal power. Sumeria was
to Babylonia, and Babylonia to Assyria, what Crete was to Greece, and
Greece to Rome: the first created a civilization, the second developed
it to its height, the third inherited it, added little to it, protected
it, and trans - mitted it as a dying gift to the encompassing and
victorious barbarians. For barbarism is always around civilization, amid
it and beneath it, ready to engulf it by arms, or mass migration, or
unchecked fertility. Barbar- ism is like the jungle; it never admits its
defeat; it waits patiently for cen- turies to recover the territory it
has lost.</p>
<p>The new state grew about four cities fed by the waters or tributaries
of t he Tigris: Ashur, which is now Kala’at -Sherghat; Arbela, which
is</p>
<p>Irbil; Kalakh, which is Nimrud; and Nineveh, which is Kuyunjik — just
across the river from oily Mosul. At Ashur prehistoric obsidian flakes
and knives have been found, and black pottery with geometric patterns
that suggest a central Asian origin; 1 at Tepe Gawra, near the site of
Nineveh, a recent expedition unearthed a town which its proud
discoverers date back to 3700 b.c., despite its many temples and tombs,
its well-carved cylinder seals, its combs and jewelry, and the oldest
dice known to his- tory 1 — a thought for reformers. The god Ashur gave
his name to a city (and finally to all Assyria); there the earliest of
the nation’s kings had their residence, until its exposure to the heat
of the desert and the attacks of the neighboring Babylonians led Ashur’s
rulers to build a secondary</p>

<p>Xcapital in cooler Nineveh — named also after a god, Nina, the Ishtar
of Assyria. Here, in the heyday of Ashurbanipal, 300,000 people lived,
and all the western Orient came to pay tribute to the Universal
King,</p>
<p>The population was a mixture of Semites from the civilized south
(Baby- lonia and Akkadia) with non-Semitic tribes from the west
(probably of Hittite or Mitannian affinity) and Kurdish mountaineers
from the Caucasus. 8 They took their common language and their arts from
Sumeria, but modified them later into an almost undistinguishable
similarity to the language and arts of Babylonia. 4 Their circumstances,
however, forbade them to indulge in the effeminate ease of Babylon; from
beginning to end they were a race of warriors, mighty in muscle and
courage, abounding in proud hair and beard, standing straight, stern and
stolid on their monuments, and bestriding with tremendous feet the
east-Mediterranean world. Their history is one of kings and slaves, wars
and conquests, bloody victories and sudden defeat. The early kings —
once mere patesis tributary to the south — took advantage of the Kassite
domination of Babylonia to establish their independence; and soon enough
one of them decked himself with that title which all the monarchs of
Assyria were to display: “Kang of Universal Reign.” Out of the dull
dynasties of these forgotten potentates certain figures emerge whose
deeds illuminate the development of their country.*</p>
<p>While Babylonia was still in the darkness of the Kassite era,
Shalmaneser I brought the little city-states of the north under one
rule, and made Kalakh his capital. But the first great name in Assyrian
history is Tiglath-Pileser I. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: if
it is wise to believe monarchs, he slew 120 lions on foot, and 800 from
his chariot. 5 One of his inscriptions — written by a scribe more
royalist than the King — tells how he hunted nations as well as animals:
“In my fierce valor I marched against the people of Qummuh, conquered
their cities, carried off their booty, their goods and their property
without reckoning, and burned their cities with fire — destroyed and
devastated them. . . . The people of Adansh left their mountains and
embraced my feet. I imposed taxes upon them.” 6 In every direction he
led his armies, conquering the Hittites, the Armenians, and forty other
nations, capturing Babylon, and frightening Egypt into sending him
anxious gifts. (He was particularly mollified by a crocodile.) With the
proceeds of his con- quests he built temples to the Assyrian gods and
goddesses, who, like anxious</p>

<p>debutantes , asked no questions about the source of his wealth. Then
Babylon revolted, defeated his armies, pillaged his temples, and carried
his gods into Babylonian captivity. Tiglath-Pileser died of shame. 7</p>
<p>His reign was a symbol and summary of all Assyrian history: death and
taxes, first for Assyria’s neighbors, then for herself. Ashurnasirpal II
con- quered a dozen petty states, brought much booty home from the wars,
cut out with his own hand the eyes of princely captives, enjoyed his
harem, and passed respectably away. 8 Shalmaneser III carried these
conquests as far as Damascus; fought costly battles, killing 16,000
Syrians in one engagement; built temples, levied tribute, and was
deposed by his son in a violent revolu- tion.® Sammuramat ruled as
queen-mother for three years, and provided a frail historical basis (for
this is all that we know of her) for the Greek legend of Semiramis —
half goddess and half queen, great general, great engineer and great
statesman — so attractively detailed by Diodorus the Sicilian. 10
Tiglath- Pileser III gathered new armies, reconquered Armenia, overran
Syria and Babylonia, made vassal cities of Damascus, Samaria and
Babylon, extended the rule of Assyria from the Caucasus to Egypt, tired
of war, became an excel- lent administrator, built many temples and
palaces, held his empire together with an iron hand, and died peacefully
in bed. Sargon II, an officer in the army, made himself king by a
Napoleonic coup d’etat; led his troops in per- son, and took in every
engagement the most dangerous post; 11 defeated Elam and Egypt,
reconquered Babylonia, and received the homage of the Jews, the
Philistines, even of the Cypriote Greeks; ruled his empire well,
encouraged arts and letters, handicrafts and trade, and died in a
victorious battle that definitely preserved Assyria from invasion by the
wild Cimmerian hordes.</p>
<p>His son Sennacherib put down revolts in the distant provinces adjoin-
ing the Persian Gulf, attacked Jerusalem and Egypt without success,*
sacked eighty-nine cities and 820 villages, captured 7,200 horses,
11,000 asses, 80,000 oxen, 800,000 sheep, and 208,000 prisoners; 13 the
official his- torian, on his life, did not understate these figures.
Then, irritated by the prejudice of Babylon in favor of freedom, he
besieged it, took it, and burned it to the ground; nearly all the
inhabitants, young and old, male and female, were put to death, so that
mountains of corpses blocked the streets; the temples and palaces were
pillaged to the last shekel , and the once omnipotent gods of Babylon
were hacked to pieces or carried in</p>

<p>268 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xbondage to Nineveh: Marduk the god became a menial to Ashur. Such
Babylonians as survived did not conclude that Marduk had been over-
rated; they told themselves — as the captive Jews would tell themselves
a century later in that same Babylon — that their god had condescended
to be defeated in order to punish his people. With the spoils of his
con- quests and pillage Sennacherib rebuilt Nineveh, changed the courses
of rivers to protect it, reclaimed waste lands with the vigor of
countries suffering from an agricultural surplus, and was assassinated
by his sons while piously mumbling his prayers . 14</p>
<p>Another son, Esarhaddon, snatched the throne from his blood-stained
brothers, invaded Egypt to punish her for supporting Syrian revolts,
made her an Assyrian province, amazed western Asia with his long
triumphal progress from Memphis to Nineveh, dragging endless booty in
his train; established Assyria in unprecedented prosperity as master of
the whole Near Eastern world; delighted Babylonia by freeing and
honoring its cap- tive gods, and rebuilding its shattered capital;
conciliated Elam by feeding its famine-stricken people in an act of
international beneficence almost without parallel in the ancient world;
and died on the way to suppress a revolt in Egypt, after giving his
empire the justest and kindliest rule in its half-barbarous history.</p>
<p>His successor, Ashurbanipal (the Sardanapalus of the Greeks), reaped
t he fruits of Esarhaddon’s sowing. During his long reign Assyria
reached the climax of its wealth and prestige; after him his country,
ruined by forty years of intermittent war, fell into exhaustion and
decay, and ended its career hardly a decade after A shurbanipal’s death.
A scribe has pre - served to us a yearly record of this reign; ir it is
a dull and bloody mess of war after war, siege after siege, starved
cities and flayed captives. The scribe represents Ashurbanipal himself
as reporting his destruction of Edam:</p>
<p>For a distance of one month and twenty- five days’ march I devas
-</p>
<p>tated the districts of Elam. I spread salt and thorn-bush there
(to</p>
<p>injure the soil). Sons of the kings, sisters of the kings, members
of</p>
<p>Elam’s royal family young and old, prefects, governors, knights,
arti- sans, as many as there were, inhabitants male and female, big
and</p>
<p>little, horses, mules, asses, flocks and herds more numerous than

<p>extent. The voice of man, the steps of flocks and herds, the
happy</p>
<p>shouts of mirth — I put an end to them in its fields, which I left
for</p>
<p>the asses, the gazelles, and all manner of wild beasts to people. 1
*</p>
<p>The severed head of the Elamite king was brought to Ashurbanipal as
he feasted with his queen in the palace garden; he had the head raised
on a pole in the midst of his guests, and the royal revel went on; later
the head was fixed over the gate of Nineveh, and slowly rotted away. The
Elamite general, Dananu, was flayed alive, and then was bled like a
lamb; his brother had his throat cut, and his body was divided into
pieces, which were distributed over the country as souvenirs.”</p>
<p>It never occurred to Ashurbanipal that he and his men were
brutal;</p>
<p>these clean-cut penalties were surgical necessities in his attempt to
remove rebellions and establish discipline among the heterogeneous and
turbulent peoples, from Ethiopia to Armenia, and from Syria to Media,
whom his predecessors had subjected to Assyrian rule; it was his
obligation to main- tain this legacy intact. He boasted of the peace
that he had established in his empire, and of the good order that
prevailed in its cities; and the boast was not without truth. That he
was not merely a conqueror intoxi- cated with blood he proved by his
munificence as a builder and as a patron of letters and the arts. Like
some Roman ruler calling to the</p>
<p>Greeks, he sent to all his dominions for sculptors and architects to
design and adorn new temples and palaces; he commissioned innumerable
scribes to secure and copy for him all the classics of Sumerian and
Babylonian literature, and gathered these copies in his library at
Nineveh, where modern scholarship found them almost intact after
twenty-five centuries of time had flowed over them. Like another
Frederick, he was as vain of his literary ab ilities as of his triumphs
in war and the chase.” Diodorus describes him as a dissolute and
bisexual Nero,” but in the wealth of docu - ments that have come down to
us from this period there is little corrobo- ration for this view. From
the composition of literary tablets Ashurbani- pal passed with royal
confidence — armed only with knife and javelin — to hand-to-hand
encounters with lions; if we may credit the reports of his
contemporaries he did not hesitate to lead the attack in person, and
often dea lt with his own hand the decisive blow.” Little wonder that
Byron was fascinated with him, and wove about him a drama half legend
and half history, in which all the wealth and power of Assyria came to
their</p>
<p>height, and broke into universal ruin and royal despair.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<ol start="12" type="I">
<li>ASSYRIAN GOVERNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>Imperialism — Assyrian war — The conscript gods — Law — Delicacies of
penology — Administration — The violence of Oriental</p>
<p>monarchies</p>
<p>If we should admit the imperial principle — that it is good, for the
sake of spreading law, security, commerce and peace, that many states
should be brought, by persuasion or force, under the authority of one
govern- ment-then we should have to concede to Assyria the distinction
of having established in western Asia a larger measure and area of order
and pros- perity than that region of the earth had ever, to our
knowledge, enjoyed before. The government of Ashurbanipal — which ruled
Assyria, Baby- lonia, Armenia, Media, Palestine, Syria, Phoenicia,
Sumeria, Elam and Egypt — was without doubt the most extensive
administrative organization yet seen in the Mediterranean or Near
Eastern world; only Hammurabi and Thutmose III had approached it, and
Persia alone would equal it be- fore the coming of Alexander. In some
ways it was a liberal empire; its larger cities retained considerable
local autonomy, and each nation in it was left its own religion, law and
ruler, provided it paid its tribute</p>
<p>promptly . 21 In so loose an organization every weakening of the
central power was bound to produce rebellions, or, at the best, a
certain tributary negligence, so that the subject states had to be
conquered again and again. To avoid these recurrent rebellions
Tiglath-Pileser III established the characteristic Assyrian policy of
deporting conquered populations to alien habitats, where, mingling with
the natives, they might lose their unity and identity, and have less
opportunity to rebel. Revolts came neverthe- less, and Assyria had to
keep herself always ready for war.</p>
<p>The army was therefore the most vital part of the government. Assyria
recognized frankly that government is the nationalization of force, and
her chief contributions to progress were in the art of war.
Chariots,</p>
<p>cavalry, infantry and sappers were organized into flexible
formations, siege mechanisms were as highly developed as among the
Romans, strat- egy and tactics were well understood . 22 Tactics
centered about the idea of rapid movement making possible a piecemeal
attack — so old is the secret of Napoleon. Iron-working had grown to the
point of encasing the warrior with armor to a degree of stiffness
rivaling a medieval knight; even the archers and pikemen wore copper or
iron helmets, padded loin-cloths,</p>
<p>ASSYRIA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>2 7 I</p>
<p>enormous shields, and a leather skirt covered with metal scales. The
weapons were arrows, lances, cutlasses, maces, clubs, slings and battle-
axes. The nobility fought from chariots in the van of the battle, and
the king, in his royal chariot, usually led them in person; generals had
not yet learned to die in bed. Ashumasirpal introduced the use of
cavalry as an aid to the chariots, and this innovation proved decisive
in many en- gagements. 83 The principal siege engine was a battering-ram
tipped with iron; sometimes it was suspended from a scaffold by ropes,
and was swung back to give it forward impetus; sometimes it was run
forward on wheels. The besieged fought from the walls with missiles,
torches, burning pitch, chain s designed to entangle the ram, and
gaseous “stink - pots” (as they were called) to befuddle the enemy ; 84
again the novel is not new. A cap- tured city was usually plundered and
burnt to the ground, and its site was deliberately denuded by killing
its trees . 85 The loyalty of the troops was secured by dividing a large
part of the spoils among them; their bravery was ensured by the general
rule of the Near East that all captives in war might be enslaved or
slain. Soldiers were rewarded for every sev- ered head they brought in
from the field, so that the aftermath of a vic- tory generally witnessed
the wholesale decapitation of fallen foes . 85 Most often the prisoners,
who would have consumed much food in a long campaign, and would have
constituted a danger and nuisance in the rear, were despatched after the
battle; they knelt with their backs to their captors, who beat their
heads in with clubs, or cut them off with cutlasses. Scribes stood by to
count the number of prisoners taken and killed by each soldier, and
apportioned the booty accordingly; the king, if time permitted, presided
at the slaughter. The nobles among the defeated were given more special
treatment: their ears, noses, hands and feet were sliced off, or they
were thrown from high towers, or they and their chil- dren were
beheaded, or flayed alive, or roasted over a slow fire. No com- punction
seems to have been felt at this waste of human fife; the birth rate
would soon make up for it, and meanwhile it relieved the pressure of
population upon the means of subsistence . 88 Probably it was in part by
their reputation for mercy to prisoners of war that Alexander and Caesar
undermined the morale of the enemy, and conquered the Mediterranean
world.</p>
<p>Next to the army the chief reliance of the monarch was upon the
church, and he paid lavishly for the support of the priests. The formal
head of the</p>
<p>272 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>Xstate was by concerted fiction the god Ashur; all pronouncements
were in his name, all laws were edicts of his divine will, all taxes
were collected for his treasury, all campaigns were fought to furnish
him (or, occasionally, an- other deity) with spoils and glory. The king
had himself described as a god, usually an incarnation of Shamash, the
sun. The religion of Assyria, like its language, its science and its
arts, was imported from Sumeria and Babylonia, with occasional
adaptations to the needs of a military state.</p>
<p>The adaptation was most visible in the case of the law, which was
dis- tinguished by a martial ruthlessness. Punishment ranged from public
exhibi- tion to forced labor, twenty to a hundred lashes, the slitting
of nose and ears, castration, pulling out the tongue, gouging out the
eyes, impalement, and beheading . 28 The laws of Sargon II prescribe
such additional delicacies as the drinking of poison, and the burning of
the offender’s son or daughter</p>
<p>Local administration, originally by feudal barons, fell in the course
of time into the hands of provincial prefects or governors appointed by
the king; this form of imperial government was taken over by Persia, and
passed on from Persia to Rome. The prefects were expected to collect
taxes, to organize the corvee for works which, like irrigation, could
not be left to personal initiative; and above all to raise regiments and
lead them in the royal cam- paigns. Meanwhile royal spies (or, as we
should say, “intelligence officers”) kept watch on these prefects and
their aides, and informed the king con- cerning the state of the
nation.</p>
<p>All in all, the Assyrian government was primarily an instrument
of</p>
<p>war. For war was often more profitable than peace; it cemented dis-
cipline, intensified patriotism, strengthened the royal power, and
brought abundant spoils and slaves for the enrichment and service of the
capital. Hence Assyrian history is largely a picture of cities sacked
and villages or fields laid waste. When Ashurbanipal suppressed the
revolt of his brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, and captured Babylon after a
long and bitter siege,</p>

<p>Assyrians. . . . Most of the numerous victims to pestilence or</p>
<p>famine lay about the streets or in the public squares, a prey to
the</p>
<p>dogs and swine; such of the inhabitants and the soldiery as were</p>
<p>comparatively strong had endeavored to escape into the country,</p>
<p>and only those remained who had not sufficient strength to drag</p>
<p>themselves beyond the walls. Ashurbanipal pursued the fugitives,</p>
<p>and having captured nearly all of them, vented on them the full</p>
<p>fury of his vengeance. He caused the tongues of the soldiers to
be</p>
<p>tom out, and then had them clubbed to death. He massacred the</p>
<p>common folk in front of the great winged bulls which had already</p>
<p>witnessed a similar butchery half a century before under his
grand-</p>
<p>father Sennacherib. The corpses of the victims remained long un-</p>
<p>buried, a prey to all unclean beasts and birds . 83</p>
<p>The weakness of Oriental monarchies was bound up with this addiction
to violence. Not only did the subject provinces repeatedly revolt, but
within the royal palace or family itself violence again and again
attempted to upset what violence had established and maintained. At or
near the end of almost every reign some disturbance broke out over the
succession to the throne; the aging monarch saw conspiracies forming
around him, and in several cases he was hastened to his end by murder.
The nations of the Near East preferred violent uprisings to corrupt
elections, and their form of recall was assassination. Some of these
wars were doubtless inevitable: barbarians prowled about every frontier,
and one reign of weakness would see the Scythians, the Cimmerians, or
some other horde, sweeping down upon the wealth of the Assyrian cities.
And perhaps we exaggerate the frequency of war and violence in these
Oriental states, through the accident that ancient monuments and modem
chroniclers have preserved the dramatic record of battles, and ignored
the victories of peace. His- torians have been prejudiced in favor of
bloodshed; they found it, or thought their readers would find it, more
interesting than the quiet</p>
<p>achievements of the mind. We think war less frequent today because we
are conscious of the lucid intervals of peace, while history seems con-
scious only of the fevered crises of war.</p>

<p>Industry and trade — Marriage and morals — Religion and science —

<p>The economic life of Assyria did not differ much from that of
Baby-</p>
<p>lonia, for in many ways the two countries were merely the north and
south of one civilization. The southern kingdom was more commercial, the
northern more agricultural; rich Babylonians were usually merchants,
rich Assyrians were most often landed gentry actively supervising great
estates, and looking with Roman scorn upon men who made their living by
buying cheap and selling dear.”<em>. Nevertheless the same rivers
flooded and nour - ished the land, die same method of ridges and canals
controlled the over- flow, the same shadufs raised the water from ever
deeper beds to fields sown with the same wheat and barley, millet and
sesame.</em> The same in- dustries supported the life of the towns; the
same system of weights and measures governed the exchange of goods; and
though Nineveh and her sister capitals were too far north to be great
centers of commerce, the wealth brought to them by Assyria’s sovereigns
filled them with handicrafts and trade.* Metal was mined or imported in
new abundance, and towards 700 b.c. iron replaced bronze as the basic
metal of industry and armament. 35 Metal was cast, glass was blown,
textiles were dyed,t earthenware was enameled, and houses were as well
equipped in Nineveh as in Europe before the Industrial Revolution. 33
During the reign of Sennacherib an aqueduct was built which brought
water to Nineveh from thirty miles away; a thousand feet of it, recently
discovered, t constitute the oldest aqueduct known. In- dustry and trade
were financed in part by private bankers, who charged 25per for loans.
Lead, copper, silver and gold served as currency; and about 700 b.c.
Sennacherib minted silver into half-shekel pieces — one of our earliest
examples of an official coinage. 87</p>
<p>The people fell into five classes: patricians or nobles; craftsmen or
master- artisans, organized in guilds, and including the professions as
well as the trades; the unskilled but free workmen and peasants of town
and village; serfs bound to the soil on great estates, in the manner of
medieval Europe;</p>
<ul>
<li>Other products of Assyrian cultivation were olives, grapes, garlic,
onions, lettuce, cress, beets, turnips, radishes, cucumbers, alfalfa,
and licorice. Meat was rarely eaten by any but the aristocracy; 84
except for fish this war-like nation was largely vegetarian.</li>

reference to cotton: “The tree that bore wool they clipped and shredded
for cotton.” 85 ® It was probably im - ported from India.</p>

<p>and slaves captured in war or attached for debt, compelled to
announce their status by pierced ears and shaven head, and performing
most of the menial labor everywhere. On a bas-relief of Sennacherib we
see super- visee holding the whip over slaves who, in long parallel
lines, are drawing a heavy piece of statuary on a wooden sledge . 38</p>
<p>Like all military states, Assyria encouraged a high birth rate by
its</p>
<p>moral code and its laws. Abortion was a capital crime; a woman who
secured miscarriage, even a woman who died of attempting it, was to be
impaled on a stake . 38 Though women rose to considerable power through
marriage and intrigue, their position was lower than in Babylonia.
Severe penalties were laid upon them for striking their husbands, wives
were not allowed to go out in public unveiled, and strict fidelity was
exacted of them — though their husbands might have all the concubines
they could afford.“ Prostitution was accepted as inevitable, and was
regulated by the state .“ 3 The king had a varied harem, whose inmates
were condemned to a secluded life of dancing, singing, quarreling,
needlework and conspir- acy . 41 A cuckolded husband might kill his
rival in flagrante delicto, and was held to be within his rights; this
is a custom that has survived many codes. For the rest the law of
matrimony was as in Babylonia, except that marriage was often by simple
purchase, and in many cases the wife lived in her father’s house,
visited occasi onally by her husband.“</p>
<p>In all departments of Assyrian life we meet with a patriarchal stern-
ness natural to a people that lived by conquest, and in every sense on
the border of barbarism. Just as the Romans took thousands of prisoners
into lifelong slavery after their victories, and dragged others to the
Circus Maximus to be torn to pieces by starving animals, so the
Assyrians seemed to find satisfaction — or a necessary tutelage for
their sons — in torturing captives, blinding children before the eyes of
their parents, flaying men alive, roasting them in kilns, chaining them
in cages for the amusement of the populace, and then sending the
survivors off to execution.“ Ashur- nasirpal tells how “all the chiefs
who had revolted I flayed, with their skins I covered the pillar, some
in the midst I walled up, others on stakes I impaled, still others I
arranged around the pillar on stakes. … As for the chieftains and royal
officers who had rebelled, I cut off their mem- bers .” 44 Ashurbanipal
boasts that “I burned three thousand captives with fire, I left not a
single one among them alive to serve as a hostage.”“ Another of his
inscriptions reads: “These warriors who had sinned against</p>
<p>Ij6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XAshur and had plotted evil against me . . . from their hostile
mouths have I tom their tongues, and I have compassed their destruction.
As for the others who remained alive, I offered them as a funerary
sacrifice; . . . their lacerated members have I given unto the dogs, the
swine, the wolves. … By accomplishing these deeds I have rejoiced the
heart of the great gods .” 46 Another monarch instructs his artisans to
engrave upon the</p>
<p>crush men and beasts. . . . The monuments which I erect are made of
human corpses from which I have cut the head and limbs. I cut off the
hands of all those whom I capture alive .” 47 Reliefs at Nineveh show
men being impaled or flayed, or having their tongues torn out; one shows
a king gouging out the eyes of prisoners with a lance while he holds
their heads conveniently in place with a cord passed through their lips
. 48 As we read such pages we become reconciled to our own
mediocrity.</p>
<p>Religion apparently did nothing to mollify this tendency to brutality
and violence. It had less influence with the government than in
Babylonia, and took its cue from the needs and tastes of the kings.
Ashur, the national deity, was a solar god, warlike and merciless to his
enemies; his people be- lieved that he took a divine satisfaction in the
execution of prisoners before his shrine.“ The essential function of
Assyrian religion was to train the future citizen to a patriotic
docility, and to teach him the art of wheedling favors out of the gods
by magic and sacrifice. The only religious texts that survive from
Assyria are exorcisms and omens. Long lists of omens have come down to
us in which the inevitable results of every manner of event are given,
and methods of avoiding them are prescribed . 60 The world was pictured
as crowded with demons, who had to be warded off by charms suspended
about the neck, or by long and careful incantations.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere the only science that flourished was that of
war. Assyrian medicine was merely Babylonian medicine; Assyrian
astronomy was merely Babylonian astrology — the stars were studied
chiefly with a view to divination . 61 We find no evidence of
philosophical speculation, no se- cular attempt to explain the world.
Assyrian philologists made lists of plants, probably for the use of
medicine, and thereby contributed moderately to establish botany; other
scribes made lists of nearly all the objects they had found under the
sun, and their attempts to classify these objects ministered slightly to
the natural science of the Greeks. From these lists our language has
taken, usually through the Greeks, such words as hangar , gypsum, camel,
plinth, shekel, rose, ammonia, jasper , cane , cherry , laudanum,
naphtha , sesame, hyssop and myrrh.™</p>

<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>The tablets recording the deeds of the kings, though they have
the</p>
<p>distinction of being at once bloody and dull, must be accorded the
honor of being among the oldest extant forms of historiography. They
were in the early years mere chronicles, registering royal victories,
and admitting of no defeats; they became, in later days, embellished and
literary ac- counts of the important events of the reign. The clearest
title of Assyria to a place in a history of civilization was its
libraries. That of Ashur-</p>
<p>banipal contained 30,000 clay tablets, classified and catalogued,
each tablet bearing an easily identifiable tag. Many of them bore the
King’s book - mark: “Whoso shall carry off this tablet, . . . may Ashur
and Belit over- throw him in wrath . . . and destroy his name and
posterity from the land.” 53 A large number of the tablets are copies of
undated older works, of which earlier forms are being constantly
discovered; the avowed pur- pose of As hurbanipal’s library was to
preserve the literature of Baby - lonia from oblivion. But only a small
number of the tablets would now be classed as literature; the majority
of them are official records, astro- logical and augural observations,
oracles, medical prescriptions and re- ports, exorcisms, hymns, prayers,
and genealogies of the kings and the gods. 51 Among the least dull of
the tablets are two in which Ashur- banipal confesses, with quaint
insistence, his scandalous delight in books and knowledge:</p>
<p>I, Ashurbanipal, understood the wisdom of Nabu,* I acquired an</p>
<p>understanding of all the arts of tablet-writing. I learnt to shoot
the</p>
<p>bow, to ride horses and chariots, and to hold the reins. . . .
Mar-</p>
<p>duk, the wise one of the gods, presented me with information and</p>
<p>understanding as a gift. . . . Enurt and Nergal made me virile
and</p>
<p>strong, of incomparable force. I understood the craft of the wise</p>
<p>Adapa, the hidden secrets of all the scribal art; in heavenly and</p>
<p>earthly buildings I read and pondered; in the meetings of clerks
I</p>
<p>was present; I watched the omens, I explained the heavens with the
learned priests, recited the complicated multiplications and divisions
that are not immediately apparent. The beautiful writings in Su-</p>
<p>merian that are obscure, in Akkadian that are difficult to bear in
mind, it was my joy to repeat. … I mounted colts, rode them with</p>
<p>prudence so that they were not violent; I drew the bow, sped the</p>
<p>arrow, the sign of the warrior. I flung the quivering javelins
like</p>
<p>short lances. … I held the reins like a charioteer. … I directed</p>

<p>Minor arts — Bas-relief — Statuary — Building — A. page from</p>
<p>“Sardanapalus”</p>
<p>At last, in the field of art, Assyria equaled her preceptor
Babylonia,</p>
<p>and in bas-relief surpassed her. Stimulated by the influx of wealth
into Ashur, Kalakh and Nineveh, artists and artisans began to produce —
for nobles and their ladies, for kings and palaces, for priests and
temples — jewels of every description, cast metal as skilfully designed
and finely wrought as on the great gates at Balawat, and luxurious
furniture of richly carved and costly woods strengthened with metal and
inlaid with gold, silver, bronze, or precious stones . 65 Pottery was
poorly developed, and music, like so much else, was merely imported from
Babylon; but tem- pera painting in bright colors under a thin glaze
became one of the char- acteristic arts of Assyria, from which it passed
to its perfection in</p>
<p>Persia. Painting, as always in the ancient East, was a secondary and
de- pendent art.</p>
<p>In the heyday of Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon and Ashurbani-
pal, and presumably through their lavish patronage, the art of
bas-relief created new masterpieces for the British Museum. One of the
best ex- amples, however, dates from Ashurnasirpal II; it represents, in
chaste alabaster, the good god Marduk overcoming the evil god of
chaos,</p>
<p>Tiamat.“ The human figures in Assyrian reliefs are stiff and coarse
and all alike, as if some perfect model had insisted on being reproduced
for- ever; all the men have the same massive heads, the same brush of
whiskers, the same stout bellies, the same invisible necks; even the
gods are these same Assyrians in very slight disguise. Only now and then
do the human figures take on vitality, as in the alabaster relief
depicting spirits in adora- tion before a palmetto tree , 66 and the
fine limestone stele of Shamsi-Adad VII found at Kalakh . 66 Usually it
is the animal reliefs that stir us; never before or since has carving
pictured animals so successfully. The panels monotonously repeat scenes
of war and the hunt; but the eye never tires of their vigor of action,
their flow of motion, and their simple directness</p>
<p>ASSYRIA</p>
<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>279</p>
<p>of line. It is as if the artist, forbidden to portray his masters
realistically or individually, had given all his lore and skill to the
animals; he repre- sents them in a profusion of species — lions, horses*
asses, goats, dogs, deer, birds, grasshoppers — and in every attitude
except rest; too often he shows them in the agony of death; but even
then they are the center and life of his picture and his art. The
majestic horses of Sargon II on the reliefs at Khorsabad ;” 0 the
wounded lioness from Sennacherib’s palace at Nine - veh ;” 1 the dying
lion in alabaster from the palace of Ashurbanipal ; 62 the lion- hunts
of Ashumasirpal II and Ashurbanipal ;“ the resting lioness,“ and the
lion released from a trap;“ the fragment in which a lion and his mate
bask in the shade of the trees””— these are among the world’s choicest
mas - terpieces in this form of art. The representation of natural
objects in the reliefs is stylized and crude; the forms are heavy, the
outlines are hard, the muscles are exaggerated; and there is no other
attempt at perspective than the placing of the distant in the upper half
of the picture, on the same scale as the foreground presented below.
Gradually, however, the guild of sculptors under Sennacherib learned to
offset these defects with a boldly realistic portrayal, a technical
finish, and above all a vivid percep- tion of action, which, in the
field of animal sculpture, have never been surpassed. Bas-relief was to
the Assyrian what sculpture was to the</p>
<p>Greek, or painting to the Italians of the Renaissance — a favorite
art uniquely expressing the national ideal of form and character.</p>
<p>We cannot say as much for Assyrian sculpture. The carvers of</p>
<p>Nineveh and Kalakh seem to have preferred relief to work in the</p>
<p>round; very little full sculpture has come down to us from the ruins,
and none of it is of a high order. The animals are full of power and
majesty, as if conscious of not only physical but moral superiority to
man — like the bulls that guarded the gateway at Khorsabad;” the human
or divine figures are primitively coarse and heavy, adorned but
undistinguished, erect but dead. An exception might be made for the
massive statue of Ashumasirpal II now in the British Museum; through all
its heavy lines one sees a man every inch a king: royal sceptre firmly
grasped, thick lips set with determination, eyes cruel and alert, a
bull-like neck boding short shrift for enemies and falsifiers of
tax-reports, and two gigantic feet full poised on the back of the
world.</p>
<p>We must not take too seriously our judgments of this sculpture; very
likely the Assyrians idolized knotted muscles and short necks, and would
have looked with martial scorn upon our almost feminine slenderness,
or</p>
<p>280 the story of civilization (chap. </p>
<p>Xthe smooth, voluptuous grace of Praxiteles’ Hermes and the Apollo
Bel - vedere. As for Assyrian architecture, how can we estimate its
excellence when nothing remains of it but ruins almost level with the
sand, and serving chiefly as a hook upon which brave archeologists may
hang their imaginative “restorations”? Like Babylonian and recent
American archi - tecture, the Assyrian aimed not at beauty but at
grandeur, and sought it by mass design. Following the traditions of
Mesopotamian art, Assyrian architecture adopted brick as its basic
material, but went its own way by facing it more lavishly with stone. It
inherited the arch and the vault from the south, developed them, and
made some experiments in columns which led the way to the caryatids and
the voluted “Ionic” capitals of the Per - sians and the Greeks.” The
palaces squatted over great areas of ground, and were wisely limited to
two or three stories in height” ordinarily th ey were designed as a
series of halls and chambers enclosing a quiet and shaded court. The
portals of the royal residences were guarded with monstrous stone
animals, the entrance hall was lined with historical re- liefs and
statuary, the floors were paved with alabaster slabs, the walls were
hung with costly tapestries, or paneled with precious woods, and
bordered with elegant mouldings; the roofs were reinforced with mas- ive
beams, sometimes covered with leaf of silver or gold, and the ceilings
we re often painted with representations of natural scenery.™</p>
<p>The six mightiest warriors of Assyria were also its greatest
builders.</p>
<p>Tiglath-Pileser I rebuilt in stone the temples of Ashur, and left
word</p>
<p>about one of them that he had “made its interior br illiant like the
vault of heaven, decorated its walls like the splendor of the rising
stars, and made it superb with shining brightness .” 71 The later
emperors gave gen - erously to the temples, but, like Solomon, they
preferred their palaces. Ashurnasirpal II built at Kalakh an immense
edifice of stone-faced brick, ornamented with reliefs praising piety and
war. Nearby, at Balawat, Ras- sam found the ruins of another structure,
from which he rescued two bronze gates of magnificent workmanship.™ Sarg
on II commemorated himself by raising a spacious palace at Dur-Sharrukin
(i.e., Fort Sargon, on the site of the modern Khorsabad) ; its gateway
was flanked by winged bulls, its walls were decorated with reliefs and
shining tiles, its vast rooms were equipped with delicately carved
furniture, and were adorned with imposing statuary. From every victory
Sargon brought more slaves to work on this construction, and more
marble, lapis lazuli, bronze, silver and gold to beautify it. Around it
he set a group of temples, and in the rear</p>

<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>he offered to the god a ziggurat of seven stories, topped with silver
and gold. Sennacherib raised at Nineveh a royal mansion called “The
Incom - parable,” surpassing in size all other palaces of antiquity;’ 8
its walls and floors sparkled with precious metals, Woods, and stones;
its tiles vied in their brilliance with the luminaries of day and night;
the metal-workers cast for it gigantic lions and oxen of copper, and the
sculptors carved for it winged bulls of limestone and alabaster, and
lined its walls with pas - toral symphonies in bas-relief. Esarhaddon
continued the rebuilding and enlargement of Nineveh, and excelled all
his predecessors in the grandeur of his edifices and the luxuriousness
of their equipment; a dozen provinces provided him with materials and
men; new ideas for columns and deco- rations came to him during his
sojourn in Egypt; and when at last his palaces and temples were complete
they were filled with the artistic booty and conceptions of the whole
Near Eastern world.’ 4</p>
<p>The worst commentary on Assyrian architecture lies in the fact
that</p>
<p>within sixty years after Esarhaddon had finished his palace it was
crum- bling into ruins.’ 5 Ashurbanipal tells us how he r ebuilt it; as
we read his inscription the centuries fade, and we see dimly into the
heart of the King:</p>
<p>At that time the harem, the resting-place of the palace . . .</p>
<p>which Sennacherib, my grandfather, had built for his royal dwell-</p>
<p>ing, had become old with joy and gladness, and its walls had
fallen.</p>
<p>I, Ashurbanipal, the Great King, the mighty King, the King of the</p>
<p>World, the King of Assyria, . . . because I had grown up in that</p>
<p>harem, and Ashjir, Sin, Shamash, Ramman, Bel, Nabu, Ishtar, . . .</p>
<p>Ninib, Nergal and Nusku had preserved me therein as crown prince, and
had extended their good protection and shelter of prosperity</p>
<p>over me, . . . and had constantly sent me joyful tidings therein
of</p>
<p>victory over my enemies; and because my dreams on my bed at</p>
<p>night were pleasant, and in the morning my fancies were bright,</p>
<p>. . . I tore down its ruins; in order to extend its area I tore it
all</p>
<p>down. I erected a building the site of whose structure was fifty</p>
<p>tibki in extent. I raised a terrace; but I was afraid before the
shrines</p>
<p>of the great gods my lords, and did not raise that structure very</p>
<p>high. In a good month, on a favorable day, I put in its
foundations</p>
<p>upon that terrace, and laid its brickwork. I emptied wine of ses-</p>
<p>ame and wine of grapes upon its cellar, and poured them also</p>
<p>upon its earthen wall. In order to build that harem the people of</p>

misfortunes that had come to his lot. The last tablet bequeathed us by

<p>CHAP. X)</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>We do not know how Ashurbanipal died; the story dramatized by</p>
<p>Byron — that he set fire to his own palace and perished in the flames
— rests on the authority of the marvel- loving Ctesias,™ and may be
merely legend. His death was in any case a symbol and an omen; soon
Assyria too was to die, and from causes of which Ashurbanipal had been a
part. For the economic vitality of Assyria had been derived too rashly
from abroad; it depended upon profitable conquests bringing in riches
and trade; at any moment it could be ended with a decisive defeat.
Gradually the qualities of body and character that had helped to make
the Assyrian armies in- vincible were weakened by the very victories
that they won; in each vic- tory it was the strongest and bravest who
died, while the infirm and cau- tious survived to multiply their kind;
it was a dysgenic process that per- haps made for civilization by
weeding out the more brutal types, but undermined the biological* basis
upon which Assyria had risen to power. The extent of her conquests had
helped to weaken her; not only had they depopulated her fields to feed
insatiate Mars, but they had brought into Assyria, as captives, millions
of destitute aliens who bred with the fertility of the hopeless,
destroyed all national unity of character and blood, and became by their
growing numbers a hostile and disintegrating force in the very midst of
the conquerors. More and more the army itself was filled by these men of
other lands, while semi-barbarous maraud- ers harassed every border, and
exhausted the resources of the country in an endless defense of its
unnatural frontiers.</p>
<p>Ashurbanipal died in 626 b.c. Fourteen years later an army of
Baby-</p>
<p>lonians under Nabopolassar united with an army of Medes under Cyax-
ares and a horde of Scythians from the Caucasus, and with amazing ease
and swiftness captured the citadels of the north. Nineveh was laid waste
as ruthlessly and completely as her kings had once ravaged Susa and
Babylon; the city was put to the torch, the population was slaughtered
or enslaved, and the palace so recently built by Ashurbanipal was sacked
and destroyed. At one blow Assyria disappeared from history. Nothing</p>
<p>When dead no pleasure more is thine. Thus I,</p>
<p>Who once o’er mighty Ninus ruled, am naught</p>
<p>But dust. Yet these are mine which gave me joy</p>
<p>In life — the food I ate, my wantonness,</p>
<p>And love’s delights. But all those oth er things</p>
<p>Men deem felicities are left behind . 78</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no inconsistency between this mood and that pictured
