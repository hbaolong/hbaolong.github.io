<p>XDante</p>
<p>1265-1321</p>
<p>I. THE ITALIAN TROUBADOURS</p>
<p>I T was at the Apulian court of Frederick II that Italian literature
was born.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Moslems in his retinue contributed some stimulus, for
every literate Moslem versified. Some years before Frederick’s death in
1250, Ciullo d’Alcamo ( c . 1200) wrote a pretty “Dialogue Between Lover
and Lady”; and Alcamo, in Sicily, was almost wholly a Moslem town. But a
more decisive influence came from the troubadours of Provence, who sent
their poems, or came in person, to the appreciative Frederick and his
cul- tured aides. Frederick himself not only supported poetry, he wrote
it, and in Italian. His prime minister, Piero delle Vigne, composed
excellent sonnets, and may have invented that arduous form. Rinaldo
d’Aquino (brother to St. Thomas), living at Frederick’s court, Guido
delle Colonne, a judge, and Iacopo da Lentino, a notary, in Frederick’s
Regno, were among the poets of this “Apulian Renaissance.” A sonnet by
Iacopo ( c . 1233), a generation before Dante’s birth, has already the
delicacy of sentiment and finish of form of the poems in the Vita
Nuova:</p>
<p>I have it in my heart to serve God so</p>
<p>That into paradise I shall repair —</p>
<p>The holy place through the which everywhere</p>
<p>I have heard say that joy and solace flow.</p>
<p>Without my lady I were loath to go —</p>
<p>She who has the bright face and the bright hair;</p>
<p>Because if she were absent, I being there,</p>
<p>My pleasure would be less than nought, I know.</p>
<p>Look you, I say not this to such intent</p>
<p>As that I there would deal in any sin;</p>
<p>I only would behold her gracious mien,</p>
<p>And beautiful soft eyes, and lovely face,</p>
<p>That so it should be my complete content</p>
<p>To see my lady joyful in her place. 1</p>
<p>When Frederick’s court traveled through Italy he took poets along
with his menagerie, and they spread their influence into Latium,
Tuscany, and Lombardy. His son Manfred continued his patronage of
poetry, and wrote</p>
<p>1056</p>
<p>DANTE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>IO57</p>
<p>lyrics that Dante praised. Much of this “Sicilian” verse was
translated into Tuscan, and shared in forming the school of poets that
culminated in Dante. At the same time French troubadours, leaving a
Languedoc harried by reli- gious wars, found refuge in Italian courts,
initiated Italian poets into the gai saber , taught Italian women to
welcome verse eulogies, and persuaded Italian magnates to reward poetry
even when addressed to their wives. Some early Tuscan poets carried
their imitation of the French troubadours so far as to write in
Provencal. Sordello (c. 1200- 70), born near Virgil’s Mantua, offended
the terrible Ezzelino, fled to Provence, and wrote, in Provengal, poems
of ethereal and fleshless love.</p>
<p>Out of this Platonic passion, by a strange marriage of metaphysics
and poetry, came the dolce stil nuovo , or “sweet new style” of Tuscany.
In - stead of the frank sensuality which they found in the Provencal
singers, the Italian poets preferred or pretended to love women as
embodiments of pure and abstract beauty, or as symbols of divine wisdom
or philosophy. This was a new note in an Italy that had known a hundred
thousand poets of love. Perhaps the spirit of St. Francis moved these
chaste pens, or the Summa of Thomas weighed upon them, or they felt the
influence of Arabic mystics who saw only God in beauty, and wrote love
poems to the deity. 2</p>
<p>A bevy of learned singers constituted the new school. Guido
Guinizelli (i23o?~75) of Bologna, whom Dante saluted as his literary
father, 3 rhymed the new philosophy of love in a famous canzone (the
Provencal canzo or song) “Of the Gentle Fleart,” where he asked God’s
pardon for loving his lady so, on the plea that she seemed an embodiment
of divinity. Lapa Gianni, Dino Frescobaldi, Guido Orlandi, Cino da
Pistoia, spread the new style through northern Italy. It was brought to
Florence by its finest pre-Dantean exponent, Guido Cavalcanti (c. 1258-
1300), Dante’s friend. By exception among these scholar poets, Guido was
a noble, son-in-law of that Farinata degli Uberti who led the Ghibelline
faction in Florence. Fie was an Averro- istic freethinker, and played
with doubts of immortality, even of God. 4 Fie took an active, violent
part in politics, was exiled by Dante and the other priors in 1 300,
fell ill, was pardoned, and died in that same year. Flis proud,
aristocratic mind was well fitted to mold sonnets of cold and classic
grace:</p>
<p>Beauty in woman; the high will’s decree;</p>
<p>Fair knighthood armed for manly exercise;</p>
<p>The pleasant song of birds; love’s soft replies;</p>
<p>The strength of rapid ships upon the sea;</p>
<p>The serene air when light begins to be;</p>
<p>The white snow, without wind, that falls and lies;</p>
<p>Fields of all flowers, the place where waters rise;</p>
<p>Silver and gold; azure in jewelry:</p>
<p>Weighed against these the sweet and quiet worth</p>
<p>Which my dear lady cherishes at heart</p>
<p>1058</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>XMight seem a little matter to be shown;</p>
<p>Being truly, over these, as much apart</p>
<p>As the whole heaven is greater than this earth.</p>
<p>All good to kindred creatures cleaveth soon. 5</p>
<p>Dante learned much from Guido, imitated his canzoni, and perhaps owed
to him the decision to write The Divine Comedy in Italian. “He desired,”
says Dante, “that I should always write to him in the vernacular speech,
not in Latin.” 6 In the course of the thirteenth century Dante’s
predecessors molded the new tongue from rude inadequacy to such melody
of speech, such concentration and subtlety of phrase, as no other
European vernacular could match; they created a language that Dante
could call “illustrious, car - dinal, courtly, and curial” 7 — fit for
the highest dignities. Beside their sonnets the verses of the Provengaux
were inharmonious, those of the trouveres and the minnesingers almost
doggerel. Here poetry had become no rhyming rivulet of gay garrulity but
a work of intense and compact art as pains- takingly carved as the
figures on the pulpits of Niccolo Pisano and his son. Partly a great man
is great because those less than he have paved his way, have molded the
mood of the time to his genius, have fashioned an instrument for his
hands, and have given him a task already half done.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>DANTE AND BEATRICE</li>
</ol>
<p>In May 1265 Bella Alighieri presented to her husband, Alighiero
Alighieri, a son whom they christened Durante Alighieri; probably they
took no thought that the words meant long-lasting wing-bearer.
Apparently the poet himself shortened his first name to Dante. 8 His
family had a lengthy pedi- gree in Florence, but had slipped into
poverty. The mother died in Dante’s early years; Alighiero married
again, and Dante grew up, perhaps unhap- pily, with a stepmother, a half
brother, and two half sisters.® The father died when Dante was fifteen,
leaving a heritage of debts. 10</p>
<p>Of Dante’s teachers he remembered most gratefully Brunetto Latini,
who, returning from France, had shortened his French encyclopedia,
Tresor, into an Italian Tesoretto ; from him Dante learned come Yuom
s’eterna — how man immortalizes himself. 11 Dante must have studied
Virgil with especial delight; he speaks of the Mantuan’s bel stilo -,
and what other student has so loved a classic as to follow its author
through hell? Boccaccio tells of Dante being at Bologna in 1287. There
or elsewhere the poet picked up so much of the sorry science and
miraculous philosophy of his time that his poem became top-heavy with
his erudition. He learned also to ride, hunt, fence, paint, and sing.
How he earned his bread we do not know. In any case he was admit- ted to
cultured circles, if only through his friendship with Cavalcanti. In
that circle he found many poets.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX) DANTE IO59</p>
<p>The most famous of all love affairs began when both Dante and
Beatrice were nine years old. According to Boccaccio the occasion was a
May Day feast in the home of Folco Portinari, one of the leading
citizens of Florence. Little “Bice” was Folco’s daughter; that she was
also Dante’s Beatrice is probable, 12 but not close enough to certainty
to calm the doubts of the meticulous. We know of this first meeting only
through the idealized de- scription written by Dante nine years later in
the Vita nuova :</p>
<p>Her dress on that day was of a most noble color, a subdued and</p>
<p>goodly crimson, girdled and adorned in such sort as suited with
her</p>
<p>very tender age. At that moment I say most truly that the spirit
of</p>
<p>life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the
heart,</p>
<p>began to tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook
therewith; and in trembling it said these words: Ecce deus fortiorme ,
qui veniens dominabitur mihi 〔Behold a deity stronger than I, who,</p>
<p>coming, will rule me〕. . . . From that time forward Love quite
gov-</p>
<p>erned my soul. 13</p>
<p>A lad nearing puberty is ripe for such a trembling; most of us have
known it, and can look back upon “calf love” as one of the most
spiritual experi - ences of our youth, a mysterious awakening of body
and soul to life and sex and beauty and our individual incompleteness,
and yet with no conscious hunger of body for body, but only a shy
longing to be near the beloved, to serve her, and hear her speak, and
watch her modest grace. Give the male soul such sensitivity as Dante’s—
a man of passion and imagination — and such a revelation and ripening
might well remain a lifelong memory and stimulus. He tells us how he
sought opportunities to see Beatrice, if only to gaze un- seen upon her.
Then he seems to have lost sight of her until, nine years later, when
they were eighteen,</p>
<p>it happened that the same wonderful lady appeared to me dressed all
in pure white, between two gentle 〔i.e., highborn〕 ladies elder than
she.</p>
<p>And passing through a street, she turned her eyes thither where I</p>
<p>stood sorely abashed; and by her unspeakable courtesy . . . she
saluted me with so virtuous a bearing that I seemed then and there to
behold the very limits of blessedness. … I parted thence as one
intoxicated.</p>
<p>. . . Then, for that I had myself in some sort the art of discoursing
with rhyme, I resolved on making a sonnet. 14</p>
<p>So, if we may believe his account, was bom his sequence of sonnets
and commentaries known as La vita nuova , The New Life. At intervals in
the next nine years (1283-92) he composed the sonnets, and later added
the prose. He sent one sonnet after another to Cavalcanti, who preserved
them and now became his friend. The whole romance is in some measure a
liter- ary artifice. The poems are spoiled for our changed taste by
their fanciful deification of Love in the manner of the troubadours, by
the long scholastic</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>1060</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>Xdissertations that interpret them, and by a number mysticism of
threes and nines; we must discount these infections of the time.</p>
<p>Love saith concerning her: “How chanceth it</p>
<p>That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?”</p>
<p>Then, gazing always, he makes oath: “For sure,</p>
<p>This is a creature of God till now unknown.”</p>
<p>She hath that paleness of the pearl that’s fit</p>
<p>In a fair woman, so much and not more.</p>
<p>She is as high as nature and skill can soar;</p>
<p>Beauty is tried by her comparison.</p>
<p>Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,</p>
<p>Spirits of love do issue thence in flame,</p>
<p>Which through their eyes who then may look on them</p>
<p>Pierce to the heart’s deep chamber every one.</p>
<p>And in her smile Love’s image you may see;</p>
<p>Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly . 15</p>
<p>Some of the prose is more pleasing than the verse:</p>
<p>When she appeared in any place it seemed to me, by the hope of her
excellent salutation, that there was no man mine enemy any longer; and
such warmth of charity came upon me that most certainly in that moment I
would have pardoned whosoever had done me an injury. . . .</p>
<p>She went along crowned and clothed with humility . . . and when she
had gone it was said by many: “This is not a woman, but one of the</p>
<p>beautiful angels of heaven” … I say, of very sooth, that she
showed</p>
<p>herself so very gentle that she bred in those who looked upon her a
soothing quiet beyond any speech . 16</p>
<p>There is no thought, in this possibly artificial infatuation, of
marriage with Beatrice. In 1289 she wedded Simone de’ Bardi, member of a
rich banking firm. Dante took no notice of so superficial an incident,
but continued to write poems about her, without mentioning her name. A
year later Beatrice died, aged twenty-four, and the poet, for the first
time naming her, mourned her in a quiet elegy:</p>
<p>Beatrice is gone up into high heaven,</p>
<p>The kingdom where the angels are at peace,</p>
<p>And lives with them, and to her friends is dead.</p>
<p>Not by the frost of winter was she driven</p>
<p>Away, like others, nor by summer heats;</p>
<p>But through a perfect gentleness instead.</p>
<p>For from the lamp of her meek lowlihead</p>
<p>Such an exceeding glory went up hence</p>
<p>That it woke wonder in the Eternal Sire,</p>
<p>Until a sweet desire</p>
<p>Entered Him for that lovely excellence,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX) DANTE Io6l</p>
<p>So that He bade her to Himself aspire,</p>
<p>Counting this weary and most evil place</p>
<p>Unworthy of a thing so full of grace. 17</p>
<p>In another poem he pictured her surrounded with homage in paradise.
“After writing this sonnet,” he tells us,</p>
<p>it was given unto me to behold a very wonderful vision, wherein I saw
things which determined me that I would say nothing further of this
blessed one until such time as I could discourse more worthily con-</p>
<p>cerning her. And to this end I labor all I can, as she well
knoweth.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if it be His pleasure through Whom is the life of all
things, that my life continue with me a few years, it is my hope that I
shall</p>
<p>yet write concerning her what hath not before been written of any</p>
<p>woman. After the which may it seem good unto Him Wt j is the</p>
<p>Master of Grace, that my spirit should go hence to behold the
glory</p>
<p>of its lady, to wit, of that blessed Beatrice who now gazeth
continually on His countenance.</p>
<p>So, in the concluding words of his little book, he laid his sights
for a greater one; and “from the first day that I saw her face in this
life, until this vision” with which he ends the Paradiso, “the sequence
of my song was never cut.” 18 Rarely has any man, through all the tides
and storms in his affairs, charted and kept so straight a course.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE POET IN POLITICS</li>
</ol>
<p>Howe ver, there were deviations. Some time after Beatrice’ death
Dante indulged himself in a series of light loves — “Pietra,”
“Pargoletta,” “Lisetta,” “or other vanity of such brief use.” 19 To one
lady, whom he names only gentil donna, he addressed love poems less
ethereal than those to Beatrice. About 1291, aged twenty-six, he married
Gemma Donati, a descendant of the oldest Florentine aristocracy. In ten
years she gave him several children, variously reckoned at three, four,
or seven. 20 Faithful to the troubadour code, he never mentioned his
wife or his children in his poetry. It would have been indelicate.
Marriage and romantic love were things apart.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps through Cavalcanti’s aid, he entered politics. For
reasons unknown to us he joined the Whites or Bianchi — the party of the
upper middle class. He must have had ability, for as early as 1300 he
was elected to the Priory or municipal council. During his brief
incumbency the Blacks .or Neri, led by Corso Donati, attempted a coup
d’etat to restore the old no- bility to power. After suppressing this
revolt the priors, Dante concurring, sought to promote peace by
banishing the leaders of both parties — among them Donati, Dante’s
relative by marriage, and Cavalcanti, his friend. In 1 301 Donati
invaded Florence with a band of armed Blacks, deposed the priors,</p>
<p>io 6 i</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>and captured the government. Early in 1302 Dante and fifteen other
citizens were tried and convicted on various political charges, were
exiled, and were sentenced to be burned to death if they should ever
enter Florence again. Dante fled, and, hoping soon to return, left his
family behind him. This exile, with confiscation of his property,
condemned the poet to indigent wan- dering for nineteen years,
embittered his spirit, and in some measure deter- mined the mood and
theme of The Divine Comedy. His fellow exiles, against Dante’s advice,
persuaded Arezzo, Bologna, and Pistoia to send against Flor - ence an
army of 10,000 men to restore them to power or their homes ( 1 304) .
The attempt failed, and thereafter Dante followed an individual course,
living with friends in Arezzo, Bologna, and Padua.</p>
<p>It was during the first decade of his exile that he gathered together
some of the poems he had written to the gentil donna, and added to them
a prose commentary transforming her into Dame Philosophy. The Convivio (
Banquet , c. 1308) tells how, in the disappointments of love and life,
Dante turned to philosophy for solace; what a divine revelation he found
in the seductive study; and how he resolved to share his findings, in
Italian, with those who could not read Latin. Apparently he had in mind
to write a new Sunnna or T esoro, in which each part would pretend to be
a commentary on a poem about the beautiful lady; it was a remarkable
scheme for redeem- ing the sensuous with the arid. The little book is a
hodge-podge of weird science, farfetched allegories, and snatches of
philosophy from Boethius and Cicero. We must mark it as a credit to Dan
te’s intelligence that after com - pleting three of fourteen intended
commentaries he abandoned the book as a total loss.</p>
<p>He took on now the modest task of re-establishing the rule of the
Holy Roman emperors in Italy. His experience had convinced him that the
chaos and violence of politics in the Italian cities were due to an
atomistic con- ception of freedom — each region, city, class,
individual, and desire demand- ing anarchic liberty. Like Machiavelli
two centuries later, he longed for some power that would co-ordinate
individuals, classes, and cities into an orderly whole within which men
might work and live in security and peace. That unifying power could
come either from the pope or from the head of the Holy Roman Empire, to
which northern Italy had long been subject in theory. But Dante had just
been exiled by a party allied with the papacy; an uncertain tradition
says that he had taken part in an unsuccessful embassy from Florence to
Boniface VIII; and for a long time the popes had opposed the unification
of Italy as a danger to their spiritual freedom as well as their
temporal power. The only hope of order seemed to lie in the restoration
of Imperial control, in a return to the majestic pax Romana of ancient
Rome.</p>
<p>So, at a date unknown, Dante wrote his provocative treatise De
monarchia. Writing in Latin as still the language of philosophy, Dante
argued that since the appropriate function of man is intellectual
activity, and since this can</p>
<p>DANTE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>1063</p>
<p>proceed only in peace, the ideal government would be a world state
main- taining a stable order and uniform justice over all the earth.
Such a state would be the proper image and correlate of the celestial
order established throughout the universe by God. Imperial Rome had come
nearest to being such an international state; God’s approval of it was
made manifest by His choosing to become man under Augustus; and Christ
Himself had bidden men accept the political authority of the Caesars.
Obviously the authority of the ancient Empire had not been derived from
the Church. But the Holy Roman Empire was that older Empire revived. It
is true that a pope crowned Charlemagne, and thereby appeared to make
the Empire subordinate to the papacy; but the “usurpation o f a right
does not create a right; if it did, the same method could show the
dependency of ecclesiastical authority on the Empire after the Emperor
Otto restored Pope Leo and deposed Bene- dict.” 21 The right of the
Empire to govern was derived not from the Church but from the natural
law that social order requires government; and since natural law is the
will of God, the state derives its powers from God. It is in - deed
proper that the emperor should acknowledge the superior authority of the
pope in matters of faith and morals; but this does not limit the
sovereignty of the state in “the earthly sphere.” 22</p>
<p>The De monorchia, despite a scholastic mechanism of disputation no
longer appetizing to the fashions of thought, was a powerful argument
for “one world” of government and law. The manuscript was known only to
a few during the author’s lifetime. After his death it was more widely
circu - lated, and was used as propaganda by the antipapal Louis the
Bavarian. It was publicly burned by order of a papal legate in 1329, was
placed on the papal Index of Forbidden Books in the sixteenth century,
and was removed from that Index by Leo XIII in 1 897.</p>
<p>According to Boccaccio, 23 Dante wrote the De monorchia “at the
coming of Henry VI.” In the year 1 310 the King of Germany invaded Italy
in the hope of re-establishing over all the peninsula except the Papal
States that Imperial rule which had died with Frederick II. Dante
welcomed him with excited hopes. In a “Letter to the Princes and Peoples
of Italy” he called upon the Lombard cities to open their hearts and
gates to the Luxembourg “Arrigo” who would deliver them from chaos and
the pope. When Henry reached Milan Dante hastened thither and threw
himself enthusiastically at the feet of the Emperor; all his dreams of a
united Italy seemed near fulfill- ment. Florence, heedless of the poet,
closed her gates against Henry, and Dante publicly addressed an angry
letter Scelestissimis Florentinis — “to the most criminal Florentines”
(March, 1 3 1 1 ) .</p>

<p>rule of one emperor for the defense of justice, peace, and
civilization, and that Italy has always been a prey to civil war

alone . . . have raged against the glory of the Roman prince, the
monarch of the earth and the ambassador of God? . . . Most foolish and
insensate men! Ye shall succumb perforce to the Imperial Eagle! 24</p>
<p>To Dante’s dismay Henry took no action against Florence. In April the
poet wrote to the Emperor like a Hebrew prophet warning kings:</p>
<p>We marvel what sluggishness delays you so long You waste the</p>
<p>spring as well as the winter at Milan Florence (do you perchance</p>
<p>know it not? ) is the dire evil This is the viper . . . from her

<p>neighboring flocks waste away. . . . Up, then, thou noble child
of</p>
<p>Jesse! 25</p>
<p>Florence responded by declaring Dante forever excluded from amnesty
and from Florence. Henry left Florence untouched, and passed via Genoa
and Pisa to Rome and Siena, where he died (1313).</p>
<p>It was a crowning disaster for Dante. He had staked everything on</p>
<p>Henry’s victory, had burned all bridges to Florence behind him. He
fled to Gubbio, and took refuge in the monastery of Santa Croce. There,
appar- ently, he wrote much of The Divine Comedy.™ But he had not yet
had his fill of politics. In 1316 he was probably with Uguccione della
Faggiuola at Lucca; in that year Uguccione defeated the Florentines at
Montecatini; Florence recovered, and included Dante’s two sons in a
sentence of death— which was never carried out. Lucca revolted against
Uguccione, and Dante was again homeless. Florence, in a mood of
victorious generosity, and forget- ting its forevers, offered amnesty
and safe return to all exiles on condition that they pay a fine, walk
through the streets in penitential garb, and submit to a brief
imprisonment. A friend notified Dante of the proclamation. He replied in
a famous letter:</p>
<p>To a Florentine friend: From your letter, which I received with
due</p>
<p>reverence and affection, I have learned with a grateful heart . . .
how dear to your soul is my return to my country. Behold, then, the
ordi- nance . . . that if I were willing to pay a certain amount of
money,</p>
<p>and suffer the stigma of oblation, I should be pardoned, and could
re- turn forthwith</p>
<p>Is this, then, the glorious recall wherewith Dante Alighieri is

<p>moned back to his country after an exile patiently endured for almost
fifteen years? . . . Far be it from a man who preaches justice … to pay
his money to those inflicting injustice, as though they were his bene-
factors. This is not the way to return to my country. … If another</p>
<p>way may be found . . . which does not derogate from the honor of</p>
<p>Dante, that will I take with no lagging steps. But if Florence is not
to be entered by such a path, then never will I enter. . . . What! Can

<p>Probably toward the close of the year 1316 he accepted the invitation
of Can Grande della Scala, ruler of Verona, to come and live as his
guest. There, apparently, he finished — there he dedicated to Can Grande
— the Paradiso of The Divine Comedy ( 1 3 1 8) . We may picture him at
this period — aged fifty- one — as Boccaccio described him in the Vita
of 1354: a man of medium height, “somewhat stooped,” walking with grave
and measured gait in som - ber dignity; dark hair and skin, long and
pensive face, furrowed projecting brow, stern deep eyes, thin aquiline
nose, tight lips, a pugnacious chin. 28 It was the face of a spirit once
gentle, but hardened to bitterness by pain; the Dante of the Vita nuova
could hardly have affected all the tenderness and sensibility there
expressed; and something of those qualities appears in the pity with
which he hears Francesca’s tale. He was grim and austere as be - came a
defeated exile; his tongue was sharpened by adversity; and he became
imperious to cover his fall from power. He prided himself on his
ancestry because he was poor. He despised the money-making bourgeoisie
of Flor- ence; he could not forgive Portinari for marrying Beatrice to a
banker; and he took the only revenge open to him by placing usurers in
one of the deepest pits of hell. He never forgot an injury or a slight,
and there were few of his enemies who escaped damnation from his pen. He
had less use than Solon for those who remained neutral in revolution or
in war. The secret of his character was a flaming intensity. “Not by the
grace of riches but by the grace of God I am what I am, and the zeal of
His house hath eaten me up.” 29</p>
<p>He poured all his strength into his poem, and could not long survive
its completion. In 1319 he left Verona and went to live with Count Guido
da Polenta at Ravenna. He received an invitation from Bologna to come
and be crowned poet laureate; he answered no in a Latin eclogue. In 1321
Guido sent him to Venice on a political mission, which failed; Dante
returned with a fever caught from the marshes of the Veneto. He was too
weak to fight it off, and it killed him on September 14, 1 32 1, in the
fifty-seventh year of his age. The Count planned to raise a handsome
tomb above the poet’s grave, but it was not done. The bas-relief that
stands above the marble coffin today was carved by Pietro Lombardo in
1483. There, as all the world knows, Byron came and wept. Today the tomb
lies almost unnoticed around the comer from Ravenna’s busiest square;
and its old and crippled custodian, for a few lire, will recite sonorous
beauties from the poem that all men praise and few men read.</p>

<li>The Poem</li>
</ol>
<p>Boccaccio relates that Dante began it in Latin hexameters, but
changed to Italian to reach a broader audience. Perhaps the ardor of his
feelings affected his choice; it seemed easier to be passionate in
Italian than in a Latin so long associated with classic urbanity and
restraint. In youth he had restricted Ital- ian to the poetry of love;
but now that his theme was the highest philosophy of human redemption
through love he wondered dared he speak in the “vul - gar” tongue. At
some uncertain time he had begun — and then had left unfin- ished — a
Latin essay De vulgari eloquentia (On Vernacular Eloquence ), as- piring
to win the learned to wider literary use of the vernacular; he had
praised the compact majesty of Latin, but had expressed the hope that
through the poetry of Frederick’s Regno and the stil nuovo of the
Lombard and Tuscan trovatori an Italian language might rise above its
dialects. &gt;to be (as the Convivio put it) “full of the: sweetest and
most exquisite beauty.” 30 “Even Dante’s pride c ould hardly dream that
his epic would not only make Italian a language fit for any enterprise
of letters, but would raise it to such dolce bellezza as the world’s
literature has seldom known.</p>
<p>Never was a poem more painstakingly planned. A weakness for triads —
as reflecting the Trinity — molded its form: there were to be three
“canticles,” each of thirty- three cantos, to correspond with the years
of Christ’s earthly life; an extra canto in the first canticle would
make a neat round hundred; each canto was to be written in groups of
three lines; and the second line of each group was to rhyme with the
first and third of the next. Nothing could be more artificial; yet. all
art is artifice, though at its best concealed; and the terza rima or
triple rhyme binds each stanza with its successor, and weaves them all
into a continued song (canto), which in the original flows trippingly on
the tongue, but in translation limps and halts on borrowed feet. Dante
in advance condemned all translations of Dante: “ Nothing that hath the
har- mony of musical connection can be transferred from its own tongue
to an- other without shattering all its sweetness. and harmony.” 31
#</p>
<p>As number dictated the form, so allegory planned the tale. In his
dedi- catory epistle to Can Grande, 32 Dante explained the symbolism of
his canticles. We might suspect this interpretation to be the
afterthought of a poet who longed to be a philosopher; but the addiction
of the Middle Ages to symbolism, the allegorical sculptures of the
cathedrals, the allegorical frescoes of Giotto, Gaddi, and Raphael, and
Dante’s allegorical sublimations in the Vita nuova and the Convivio
suggest that the poet really had in mind</p>

<p>DANTE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX )</p>
<p>IO(&gt;7</p>
<p>the outlines of the scheme that he described in perhaps imaginary
detail. The poem, he says, belongs to the genus philosophy, and its
concern is morality. Like a theologian interpreting the Bible, he
assigns three meanings to his words: the literal, the allegorical, and
the mystical.</p>
<p>The subject of this work according to the letter … is the state
of</p>
<p>souls after death. . . . But if the work be taken allegorically its
subject is Man, in so far as by merit or demerit … he is exposed to the
rewards or punishments of justice. . . . The aim of the whole and the
part is to remove those living in this life from a state of misery, and
to guide</p>
<p>them to a state of happiness.</p>
<p>Otherwise expressed, the Inferno is man passing through sin,
suffering, and despair; the Purgatorio is his cleansing through faith;
the Paradiso is his re- demption through divine revelation and unselfish
love. Virgil, who guides Dante through hell and purgatory, stands for
knowledge, reason, wisdom, which can lead us to the portals of
happiness; only faith and love (Beatrice) can lead us in. In the epic of
Dante’s life his exile was his hell, his studies and his writings were
his purgation, his hope and love were his redemption and his only bliss.
It is perhaps because Dante takes his symbolism most seriously in the
Paradiso that this canticle is the hardest to enjoy; for the Beatrice
who was a heavenly vision in the Vita mwva becomes in Dante’s vision of
heaven a pompous abstraction — hardly a meet fate for such impeccable
loveliness. Finally Dante explains to Can Grande why he calls his epic
Commedia * — because the story passed from misery to happiness, and
because “it is written</p>
<p>This painful comedy, “this book on which I have grown thin through
all these years,” 34 was the work and solace of his exile, and was
finished only three years before his death. It summarized his life, his
learning, his theology, his philosophy; if it had also embodied the
humor and tenderness and full- blooded sensuality of the Middle Ages it
might have been “a medieval synthe - sis.” Into these hundred brief
cantos Dante crowded th e science that he had gathered from Brunetto
Latini, and perhaps from Bologna; the astronomy, cosmology, geology, and
chronology of an age too busy living to be learned. He accepted not only
the mystic influences and fatalities of astrology, but all the
cabalistic mythology that ascribed occult significance and powers to
numbers and the alphabet. The number nine distinguishes Beatrice because
its square root is the three made holy by the Trinity. There are nine
circles in hell, nine levels in purgatory, nine spheres in paradise. By
and large Dante adopts with awe and gratitude the philosophy and
theology of Thomas Aquinas, but with no servile fidelity; St. Thomas
would have winced at the arguments of the De monorchia , or the sight of
popes in hell . Dante’s concep -</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>tion of God as light and love ( Vamor che move il sole e Paltre
stelle — “the love that moves the sun and the other stars”) 35 is A
ristotle carried down through Arabic philosophy. He knows something of
al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Averroes; and though he assigns
Averroes to limbo, he shocks orthodoxy by placing the Averroist heretic
Siger de Brabant in heaven; 30 moreover he puts into the mouth of Thomas
words of praise for the one man who had stirred the Seraphic Doctor to
theological wrath. Yet Siger seems to have denied that personal
immortality on which Dante’s poem rests. History has exaggerated either
the heterodoxy of Siger or the orthodoxy of Dante.</p>
<p>Recent studies have stressed Oriental, and especially Islamic,
sources for Dante’s ideas: 37 a Persian legend of Arda Viraf’s ascension
to heaven; the descriptions of hell in the Koran; the story of
Mohammed’s trip to heaven; the tour of heaven and hell in Abu-l-Ala al-
Ma‘arri’s Risalat al -Ghujran-, the Futuhat of Ibn Arabi. … In the
Risalat al- Ma‘arri pictures Iblis (Satan)</p>
<p>bound and tortured in hell, and Christian and other “infidel” poets
suffering there; at the gate of paradise the narrator is met by a houri
or beautiful maiden, who has been appointed his guide. 38 In the Futuhat
Ibn Arabi (who wrote love poems with pious allegorical interpretations)
drew precise dia- grams of the hereafter, described hell and heaven as
exactly beneath and above Jerusalem, divided hell and heaven into nine
levels, and pictured the circle of the Mystic Rose, and choirs of angels
surrounding the Divine Light — all as in The Divine Comedy. 69 So far as
we know, none of these Arabic writings had by Dante’s time been
translated into any language that he could read.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic literature describing tours or visions of heaven or
hell</p>
<p>abounded in Judaism and Christianity, not to speak of the sixth book
of Vir- gil’s Aeneid. A n Irish legend told how St. Patrick had visited
purgatory and hell, and had seen there tunics and sepulchers of fire,
sinners hanging head downward, or devoured by serpents, or covered with
ice. 40 In twelfth- century England a priest-trouvere, Adam de Ros,
recounted in a substantial poem St. Paul’s tour of hell under the
guidance of the archangel Michael; made Michael expound the gradation of
punishments for different degrees of sin; and showed Paul trembling like
Dante before these horrors. 41 Joachim of Flora had told of his own
descent into hell and ascent into heaven. There were hundreds of such
visions and tales. With all this damning evidence it was hardly
necessary for Dante to cross linguistic barriers into Islam in order to
find models for his Inferno. Like any artist he fused existing ma-
terial, transformed it from chaos to order, and set it on fire with his
passionate imagination and his burning sincerity. He took the elements
of his work wherever he could find them — in Thomas and the troubadours,
in Peter Damian’s fiery sermons on the pains of hell, in his brooding
over Beatrice liv - ing and Beatrice dead, in his conflicts with
politicians and popes; in the scraps of science that crossed his path;
in the Christian theology of the Fall, the</p>

<p>1069</p>
<p>Incarnation, sin and grace, and the Last Judgment; in the
Plotinian-Augus- tinian conception of the graduated ascent of the soul
to union with God; in Thomas’ emphasis on the Beatific Vision as the
final and only satisfying goal of man; and out of these he made the poem
in which all the terror, hope, and pilgrimage of the medieval spirit
found voice, symbol, and form.</p>

<li>Hell</li>
</ol>
<p>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p>
<p>Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p>
<p>Che la diritta via era smarrita.</p>
<p>“Midway on the road of our life I found myself in a dark wood, whose
direct way was blurred” and lost . 42 Wandering in this darkness, Dante
meets Virgil, his “master and guide, from whom alone I took the
beautiful style t hat has brought me honor.” 43 Virgil tells him that
the only safe exit from the wood is through hell and purgatory; but if
Dante will accompany him through these, he will conduct him to the
portals of paradise, “where a worthier than I must lead thee”; indeed,
he adds, it is at Beatrice’ command that he has come to the poet’s
aid.</p>
<p>They pass through an opening in the earth’s surface to the gates of
hell, inscribed with these bitter words:</p>
<p>Per me si va nella citta dolente,</p>
<p>Per me si va nell’ eterno dolore,</p>
<p>Per me si va tra la perduta gente.</p>
<p>Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore;</p>
<p>Fecemi la divina potestate,</p>
<p>La somma sapienza e il primo amore.</p>
<p>Dinanzi a me non fur cose create,</p>
<p>Se non eterne, ed io eterno duro:</p>
<p>Lasciate ogni speranza, voi c h’ entrate! 44</p>
<p>“Through me one enters the sorrowful city; through me one enters into
eter - nal pain; through me one enters among the lost.race. Justice
moved my high Maker; divine power made me, supreme wisdom, and primeval
love. Before me were no things created except eternal ones; and I endure
eternally. All hope abandon, ye who enter here!”</p>
<p>Hell is a subterranean funnel, reaching down to the center of the
earth. Dante conceives it with a powerful, almost a sadistic,
imagination: dark and frightening abysses between gigantic murky rocks;
steaming, stinking marshes, torrents, lakes, and streams; storms of
rain, snow, hail, and brands of fire; howling winds and petrifying cold;
tortured bodies, grimacing faces, blood-stilling shrieks and groans.
Nearest the top of this infernal fun- nel are those who were neither
good nor bad, and those who were neutral;</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO70</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xignoble irritations punish them; they are bitten by wasps and
hornets, gnawed by worms, consumed with envy and remorse. The never
neutral Dante scorns them, and makes Virgil say:</p>
<p>Misericordia e giustizia gli sdegna:</p>
<p>Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passa — 45</p>
<p>“Mercy and justice despise them. We do not speak of them, but look
and pass on.” The tourists come to the subterranean river Acheron, and
are fer- ried over by old Charon, serving here since Homer’s days. On
the farther shore Dante finds himself in limbo, the first circle of
hell, where stay the virtuous but unbaptized, including Virgil and all
good heathen, and all good Jews except a few Old Testament heroes whom
Christ, visiting limbo, re- leased to heaven. Their only suffering is
that they eternally desire a better fate, and know that they will never
receive it. There in limbo, honored by all its denizens, are great pagan
poets — Homer, Horace, Ovid, Lucan; they welcome Virgil, and make Dante
the sixth of their tribe. Looking still higher, says Dante,</p>
<p>Vidi il Maestro di color che sanno</p>
<p>Seder tra filosofica famiglia —</p>
<p>“I saw the master of those who know, seated amid the philosophic
family”— i.e., Aristotle, surrounded by Socrates, Plato, Democritus,
Diogenes, Hera- clitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Thales, Zeno, Cicero,
Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna , and Averroes
“who made the great commentary.” 46 Obviously, if Dante had had his way,
all this noble com - pany, including the Saracen infidels, would have
graced paradise.</p>
<p>Virgil now leads him down into the second circle, where carnal
sinners are ceaselessly tossed about by furious winds; here Dante sees
Paris, Helen, Dido, Semiramis, Cleopatra, Tristan, and Paolo and
Francesca. To end a family feud between the Polentas, lords of Ravenna,
and the Malatestas, lords of Rimini, the lovely Francesca da Polenta was
to wed the brave but deformed Gianciotto Malatesta. The rest of the
story is uncertain; a favored version makes Paolo, the handsome brother
of Gianciotto, pretend to be the suitor; to him Francesca pledged
herself; but on the wedding day she found herself reluctantly marrying
Gianciotto. Soon afterward she enjoyed for a moment Paolo’s love; in
that moment Gianciotto caught and slew them ( c .</p>
<p>1265). Swaying in the wind as a fleshless wraith beside the ghost of
her dis- embodied lover, Francesca da Rimini tells Dante her story:</p>

<p>Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day</p>
<p>We read no more . 47</p>
<p>Dante faints with pity at this tale. He wakes to find himself in the
third circle of hell, where those who were guilty of gluttony lie in
mire under a continuous storm of snow, hail, and dirty water, while
Cerberus barks over them and rends them piecemeal with threefold jaws.
Virgil and Dante de- scend into the fourth circle, where Plutus is
stationed; here the prodigal and the avaricious meet in conflict,
rolling great weights against each other in a Sisyphean war. The poets
follow the murky boiling river Styx down into the fifth circle; here
those who sinned by wrath are covered with filth, and smite and tear
themselves; and those who were sinfully slothful are submerged in the
stagnant water of the Stygian lake, whose muddy surface bubbles with
their gasps. The wanderers are conveyed across the lake by Phlegyas, and
reach in the sixth circle the city of Dis or Lucifer, where heretics are
roasted in flaming sepulchers. They descend into the seventh circle;
there, under the presidency of the Minotaur, those who committed crimes
of violence are perpetually near to drowning in a roaring river of
blood; centaurs shoot them with arrows when their heads emerge. In one
compartment of this circle are the suicides, including Piero delle
Vigne; in another those who committed violence against God or nature or
art stand with bare feet on hot sands, while flakes of fire fall upon
their heads. Among the sodomites Dante meets his old</p>
<p>IO72 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xteacher, Brunetto Latini — a tasteless doom for a guide,
philosopher, and friend.</p>
<p>At the edge of the eighth circle a horrible monster appears, who
bears the poets down into the pit of usurers. In the upper gulfs of this
circle an ingeni- ous diversity of unending pains falls upon seducers,
flatterers, and simoniacs. The latter are fixed head downward in holes;
only their legs protrude, and flames lick their feet caressingly. Among
the simoniacs is Pope Nicholas III (1277-80), whose evil deeds, along
with those of other popes, are bitterly denounced; and by a bold fancy
Dante pictures Nicholas as mistaking him for Boniface VIII (d. 1303),
whose arrival in hell is expected at any hour. 48 Soon, Nicholas
predicts, Clement V (d. 1314) will also come. In the fourth gulf of the
eighth circle are those who presumed to foretell the future; their heads
are fixed face backward on their necks. From a bridge — “Malebolge” —
over the fifth gulf they look down upon public peculators, who swim for-
ever in a lake of boiling pitch. Hypocrites pass continually around the
sixth gulf, wearing gilded cloaks of lead. Along the only pathway in
that gulf lies Caiaphas, prostrate and crucified, so that all who pass
must tread upon his flesh. In the seventh gulf robbers are tormented by
venomous snakes; Dante recognizes here several Florentines. From an arch
over the eighth gulf he sees flames consuming and reconsuming evil
counselors; here is the wily Odys- seus. In the ninth gulf
scandalmongers and schismatics are tom limb from limb; here is Mohammed,
described with appalling ferocity:</p>
<p>As one I marked, torn from the chin throughout,</p>
<p>Down to the hinder passage; ’twixt the legs</p>
<p>Dangling his entrails hung; the midriff lay</p>
<p>Open to view; and wretched ventricle</p>
<p>That turns the englutted aliment to dross.</p>
<p>Whilst eagerly I fixed on him my gaze,</p>
<p>He eyed me, with his hands laid his breast bare,</p>
<p>And cried: “Now mark how I do rip me; lo!</p>
<p>And is Mohammed mangled. Before me</p>
<p>Walks Ali weeping; from the chin his face</p>
<p>Cleft to the forelock; and the others all,</p>
<p>Whom here thou seest, while they live, did sow</p>
<p>Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.</p>

<p>Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again</p>
<p>Each of this ream when we have compassed round</p>
<p>The dismal way; for first our gashes close</p>
<p>Ere we repass him.” 49</p>
<p>In the tenth gulf of the eighth circle lie forgers, counterfeiters,
and alche- mists, moaning with varied ailments; a stench of sweat and
pus fills the air, and the groans of the sufferers make a terrifying
roar.</p>

<p>IO73</p>
<p>At last the poets reach the ninth and lowest circle of hell, which,
strange to relate, is a vast well of ice. Here traitors are buried in
the ice to their chins; tears of pain freeze into a “crystalline visor”
over their faces. Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, who betrayed Pisa, is
here eternally bound to Archbishop Ruggieri, who imprisoned him with his
sons and grandsons and allowed them all to starve to death. Now
Ugolino’s head lies upon the Archbishop’s, which it chews forever. At
nadir, the center of the earth and the very bottom of the narrowing
funnel of hell, the giant Lucifer lies buried to the waist in ice,
flapping enormous wings from his shoulders, weeping icy tears of blood
from the three faces that divide his head, and chewing a traitor in each
of three jaws — Brutus, Cassius, and Judas.</p>
<p>Half the terrors of the medieval soul are gathered into this gory
chronicle. As one reads its awful pages the gruesome horror mounts,
until at last the cumulative effect is oppressive and overwhelming. Not
all the sins and crimes of man from nebula to nebula could match the
sadistic fury of this divine revenge. Dante’s conception of hell is the
crowning indecency of medieval theology. Classic antiquity had thought
of a Hades or Avernus that received all the human dead into a
subterranean and indiscriminate darkness; but it had not pictured that
Tartarus as a place of torture. Centuries of barbarism, insecurity, and
war had to intervene before man could defile his God with attributes of
undying vengeance and inexhaustible cruelty.</p>
<p>With relief we learn at the end that Virgil and Dante have passed
through the center of the earth, have inverted the direction of their
heads and feet, and are moving upward toward the antipodes. With the
time-disdaining swiftness of a dream the two poets traverse in two days
the diameter of the earth. They emerge in the southern hemisphere on
Easter morning, drink in the light of day, and stand at the foot of the
terraced mountain which is purgatory.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Purgatory</li>
</ol>
<p>The conception of purgatory is by comparison humane: man may by ef-
fort and pain, by hope and vision, cleanse himself of sin and
selfishness, and mount step by step to understanding, love, and bliss.
So Dante pictures pur- gatory as a mountainous cone divided into nine
levels: an antepurgatory, seven terraces — one for the purgation of each
of the Deadly Sins — and, at the summit, the Earthly Paradise. From each
level the sinner moves with dimin- ishing pain to a higher level; and at
each ascent an angel chants one of the Beatitudes. In the lower stages
there are stern punishments for sins shriven and forgiven but not yet
atoned for with sufficient penalty; nevertheless, as against hell’s
bitter consciousness that suffering will never end, there is h ere the
strengthening certainty that after finite punishment will come an
eter-</p>
<p>1074 the age of faith (chap. XXXI</p>
<p>Xnity of happiness. A softer mood and a brightening light pervade
these cantos, and reveal a Dante learning mildness from his pagan
guide.</p>
<p>Virgil, with daubs of dew, washes from Dante’s face the sweat and
grime of hell. The sea surrounding the mountain shimmers under the
rising sun, as the sin-darkened soul trembles with joy at the coming of
divine grace. Here on the first level, in accord with Thomas’ hope that
some good heathen might be saved, Dante encounters Cato of Utica, the
stem stiff Stoic who, rather than suffer Caesar’s mercy, killed himself.
Here, too, is Manfred, Frederick’s son, who fought a pope but loved
poetry. Vir gil hurries Dante onward with oft quoted lines:</p>
<p>Lascia dir le genti;</p>
<p>Sta come torre ferma che non crolla</p>
<p>Giammai la cima per soffiar de’ venti—</p>
<p>“Let the people talk; stand like a firm tower, which never shakes its
top for all the blowing of the wi nds.” 50 Virgil is not at home in
purgatory; he can - not answer Dante’s questions as readily as in his
wonted hell; he feels his lack, and shows at times an irritated
wistfulness. He is comforted when they meet Sordello; the poet sons of
Mantua fall int o each other’s arms, united by the Italian’s affection
for the city of his youth. Thereupon Dante breaks out into a bitter
apostrophe to his country, summarizing his essay on the need of
monarchy:</p>
<p>Ah, slavish Italy! thou inn of grief!</p>
<p>Vessel without a pilot in loud storm!</p>
<p>Lady no longer of fair provinces,</p>
<p>But brothel-house impure! This gentle spirit,</p>
<p>Even from the pleasant sound of his dear land</p>
<p>Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen</p>
<p>With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones</p>
<p>In thee abide not without war; and one</p>
<p>Malicious gnaws another; ay, of those</p>
<p>Whom the same wall and the same moat contain.</p>
<p>Seek, wretched one, around thy seacoasts wide,</p>
<p>Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark</p>
<p>If any part of thee sweet peace enjoy.</p>

<p>Ah, people, that devoted still should be</p>
<p>And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,</p>
<p>If well thou markedst that which God commands! 51</p>
<p>And as if to point his fondness for kings that can hold a steady
rein, he tells how Sordello guides them, at the base of the purgatorial
mount, to a lovely sunny valley, flower-strewn and fragrant, where dwell
the Emperor Rudolf,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX) DANTE IO75</p>
<p>King Ottokar of Bohemia, Peter III of Aragon, Henry II of England,
Philip III of France.</p>
<p>Conducted by Lucia (symbolizing the light of God’s grace) , Dante and
Virgil are admitted by an angel to the first terrace of purgatory. Here
the proud are punished by carrying on their bent backs each a massive
stone; while reliefs on wall and pavement picture famous deeds of
humility, and the dire results of pride. On the second terrace the
envious, clad in sackcloth, have their eyes repeatedly sewn up with iron
threads. On the third terrace anger, on the fourth sloth, on the fifth
avarice, endure their appropriate pen- alties. Here Pope Hadrian V, once
covetous of wealth, does penance peace- fully, calm in the surety of
ultimate salvation. In one of the many delightful episodes that brighten
the Purgatorio, the Roman poet Statius appears, and greets the travelers
with such joy as seldom moves a poet meeting another poet on the earth.
Together the three mount to the sixth terrace, where the sin of gluttony
is cleansed; trees dangle sweet-smelling fruit before the penitents, but
withdraw them when hands reach out to grasp, while voices in the air
recount historic feats of temperance. On the seventh and last ter- race
are those who sinned by incontinence, but were shriven before death;
they are gently singed and purified by flames. Dante has a poet’s
sympathy for sins of the flesh, above all when committed by persons of
artistic tempera- ment, and therefore especially sensitive, imaginative,
and precipitous. Here is Guido Guinizelli; Dante hails him as pater in
litteris, and thanks him for “sweet songs which, as long as our language
lasts, will make us love the very</p>
<p>An angel guides them through fire, by the last ascent, into the
Earthly Paradise. Here Virgil bids him farewell:</p>
<p>My ken</p>
<p>No farther reaches. I with skill and art</p>
<p>Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take</p>
<p>For guide Lo! the sun that darts</p>
<p>His beam upon thy forehead, lo! the herb,</p>
<p>The arborets and flowers, which of itself</p>
<p>This land pours forth profuse. Till those bright eyes 〔of
Beatrice〕</p>
<p>With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste</p>
<p>To succor thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,</p>
<p>Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more</p>
<p>Sanction of warning voice or sign from me.</p>
<p>Free of thine own arbitrament to choose.</p>
<p>Discreet, judicious … I invest thee then</p>
<p>With crown and miter, sovereign o’er thyself . 88</p>
<p>Virgil and Statius now behind instead of before him, Dante wanders
through the woods and fields, and along the streams, of the Earthly
Paradise, breathing the pleasant odor of its pure air, hearing from the
trees the songs</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>IO76</p>
<p>(chap. XXXI</p>
<p>Xof “feathered choristers” chanting prime. A lady culling flowers
stops her singing to explain to him why this fair country is deserted:
it was once the Garden of Eden, but man’s disobedience exiled him and
mankind from its innocent delights. To this forfeited Paradise Beatrice
descends from heaven, clothed in such blinding radiance that Dante can
only feel her presence but not see it.</p>
<p>Albeit my eyes discerned her not, there moved</p>
<p>A hidden virtue from her, at whose touch</p>
<p>The power of ancient love was strong within me. 64</p>
<p>He turns to address his poet guide, but Virgil has returned to the
limbo from which the summons of Beatrice had drawn him. Dante weeps, but
Beatrice bids him mourn rather the sins of lust with which, after her
death, he tar- nished her image in his soul; indeed, she tells him, that
dark wood, from which through Virgil she has rescued him, was the life
of incontinence wherein, at the mid-point of his years, he had found
himself lost, with the right road dimmed. Dante falls to the ground in
shame, and confesses his sins. Celestial virgins come and intercede with
the offended Beatrice, and beg her to reveal to him her second and
spiritual beauty. Not that she has forgot- ten the first:</p>
<p>Never didst thou spy,</p>
<p>In art or nature, aught so passing sweet</p>
<p>As were the limbs that in their beauteous frame</p>
<p>Enclosed me, and are scattered now in dust. 65</p>
<p>She relents, and shows her new celestial beauty; but the virgins warn
Dante not to gaze upon her directly, but only to look at her feet.
Beatrice leads him and Statius (who has completed, after twelve
centuries, his term in purgatory) to a fountain from which issue two
streams — Lethe (Forget- fulness) and Eunoe (Good Understanding). Dante
drinks of Eunoe and is cleansed, and, now regenerate, is “made apt for
mounting to the stars.” 56 It is not true that the Inferno is the only
interesting part of The Divine Comedy. There are many arid didactic
passages in the Purgatorio, and al- ways a ballast of theology; but in
this canticle the poem, freed from the hor- rors of damnation, mounts
step by step in beauty and tenderness, cheers the ascent with nature’s
loveliness regained, and faces bravely the task of making the
disembodied Beatrice beautiful. Through her again, as in his youth,
Dante enters paradise.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Heaven</li>
</ol>
<p>Dante’s theology made his task harder. Had he allowed himself to
picture paradise in Persian or Mohammedan style as a garden of physical
as well as spiritual delights, his sensuous nature would have found
abundant imagery.</p>
<p>DANTE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>IO77</p>
<p>But how can that “constitutional materialist,” the human intellect,
conceive a heaven of purely spiritual bliss? Moreover, Dante?* s
philosophical develop- ment forbade him to represent God, or the angels
and saints of heaven, in anthropomorphic terms; rather he visions them
as forms and points of light; and the resultant abstractions lose in a
luminous void the life and warmth of sinful flesh. But Catholic doctrine
professed the resurrection of the body; and Dante, while struggling to
be spiritual, endows some denizens of heaven with corporeal features and
human speech. It is pleasant to learn that even in heaven Beatrice has
beautiful feet.</p>
<p>His plan of paradise is worked out with impressive consistency,
brilliant imagination, and bold detail. Following Ptolemaic astronomy,
he thinks of the heavens as an expanding series of nine hollow crystal
spheres revolving about the earth; these spheres are the “many mansions”
of the “Father’s house.” In each sphere a planet and a multitude of
stars are set like gems in a diadem. As they move, these celestial
bodies, all endowed in gradation with divine intelligence, sing the joy
of their blessedness and the praise of their Creator, and bathe the
heavens in the music of the spheres. The stars, says Dante, are the
saints of heaven, the souls of the saved; and according to the merits
that they earned in life, so differently high is their station above the
earth, so loftier is their happiness, so nearer are they to that
empyrean which is above all the spheres, and holds the throne of
God.</p>
<p>As if drawn by the light that radiates from Beatrice, Dante rises
from the Earthly Paradise to the first circle of the heavens, which is
that of the moon. There are the souls of those who by no fault of their
own were forced to violate their religious vows. One such, Piccarda
Donati, explains to Dante that though they are in the lowest circle of
the heavens, and enjoy a degree of bliss less than that of the spirits
above them, they are freed by the Divine Wisdom from all envy, longing,
or discontent. For the essence of happiness lies in the joyful
acceptance of the Divine Will: la sua voluntate e nostra pace —“His will
is our peace.” 57 This is the basic line of The Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>Subject to a celestial magnetism that draws all things to God, Dante
rises with Beatrice to the second heaven, which is the sphere dominated
by the planet Mercury. Here are those who on earth were absorbed in
practical ac- tivity to good ends, but were more intent on worldly honor
than on serving God. Justinian appears, and phrases in royal lines the
historic functions of the Roman Empire and Roman law; through him Dante
strikes another blow for one world under one law and king. Beatrice
leads the poet to the third heaven, the circle of Venus, where the
Provengal bard Folque foretells the tragedy of Boniface VIII. In the
fourth heaven, whose orb is the sun, Dante finds the Christian
philosophers — Boethius, Isidore of Seville, Bede, Peter Lombard,
Gratian, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and Siger de
Brabant. In a gracious exchange Thomas the Dominican relates to Dante
the life of St. Francis, and Bonaventura the Franciscan tells him
the</p>
<p>IO78 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xstory of St. Dominic. Thomas, always a man and mind of some expanse,
clogs the narrative with discourses on theological subtleties; and Dante
is so anxious to be a philosopher that for several cantos he ceases to
be a poet.</p>
<p>Beatrice leads him to the fifth heaven, that of Mars, where are the
souls of warriors who died fighting for the true faith — Joshua, Judas
Maccabaeus, Charlemagne, even Robert Guiscard, ravager of Rome. They are
arranged as thousands of stars in the form of a dazzling cross and the
figure of the Crucified; and every star in the luminous emblem joins in
a celestial harmony. Ascending to the sixth heaven, that of Jupiter,
Dante finds those who on earth administered justice equitably; here are
David, Hezekiah, Constantine, Trajan — another pagan breaking into
heaven. These living stars are arranged in the form of an eagle; they
speak with one voice, discoursing to Dante on theology, and celebrating
the praise of just kings.</p>
<p>Mounting what Beatrice figuratively calls the “stairway of the
eternal pal - ace,” the poet and his guide reach the seventh heaven of
delight, the planet Saturn and its attendant stars. At every ascent the
beauty of Beatrice takes on new brilliance, as if enhanced by the rising
splendor of each higher sphere. She dares not smile upon her lover, lest
he be consumed to ashes in her radi- ance. This is the circle of monks
who lived in piety and fidelity to their vows. Peter Damian is among
them; Dante asks him how to reconcile man’s freedom with God’s foresight
and consequent predestination; Peter replies that eve n the most
enlightened souls in heaven, under God, cannot answer his question.
St. Benedict appears, and mourns the corruption of his monks.</p>
<p>Now the poet floats upward from the circles of the planets to the
eighth heaven, the zone of the fixed stars. From the constellation
Gemini he looks down and sees the infinitesimal earth, “so pitiful of
semblance that it moved my smiles.” A moment of homesickness, even for
that miserable planet, might have moved him then; but a glance from
Beatrice tells him that this heaven of light and love, and not that
scene of sin and strife, is his proper home.</p>
<p>Canto XXIII opens with one of Dante’s characteristic similes:</p>
<p>Even as the bird, who midst the leafy bower</p>
<p>Has in her nest sat darkly through the night</p>
<p>With her sweet brood, impatient to descry</p>
<p>Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,</p>
<p>In the fond quest unconscious of her toil;</p>
<p>She, of the time prevenient, on the spray</p>
<p>That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze</p>
<p>Expects the sun, nor ever, till the dawn,</p>
<p>Removeth from the east her eager ken —</p>
<p>So Beatrice fixes her eyes in one direction expectantly. Suddenly the
heavens there shine with startling splendor. “Behold,” cries Beatrice,
“the triumphant hosts of Christ!”— souls new won for paradise. Dante
looks, but sees only a light so full and strong that he is blinded, and
cannot tell what passes by.</p>
<p>DANTE</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX)</p>
<p>IO79</p>
<p>Beatrice bids him open his eyes; now, she says, he can endure her
full radi- ance. She smiles upon him, and it is, he swears, an
experience that can never be canceled from his memory. “Why doth my face
enamor thee?” she asks, and bids him rather look at Christ and Mary and
the apostles. He tries to make them out, but sees merely “legions of
splendors, on whom burning rays shed lightnings from above”; while to
his ears comes the music of the Regina coeli, sung by heavenly
hosts.</p>
<p>Christ and Mary ascend, but the apostles remain behind, and Beatrice
asks them to speak to Dante. Peter questions him about his faith, is
pleased with his replies, and agrees with him that as long as Boniface
is Pope the Apostolic See is vacant or defiled . 58 There is no mercy in
Dante for Boniface.</p>
<p>The apostles vanish upward, and Dante mounts at last, with “her who
hath impar adised my soul,” into the ninth and highest heaven. Here in
the empy - rean there are no stars, only pure light, and the spiritual,
incorporeal, un- caused, motionless source of all souls, bodies, causes,
motions, light, and life — God. The poet struggles now to achieve the
Beatific Vision; but all he sees is a point of light about which revolve
nine circles of pure Intelligences — sera- phim, cherubim, thrones,
dominions, virtues, powers, principalities, arch- angels, and angels;
through these, His agents and emissaries, the Almighty governs the
world. But though Dante cannot perceive the Divine Essence, he beholds
all the hosts of heaven forming themselves into a luminous rose, a
marvel of shimmering lights and diverse hues expanding leaf by leaf into
a gigantic flower.</p>
<p>Beatrice leaves her lover now, and takes her place in the rose. He
sees her seated on her individual throne, and prays her still to help
him; she smiles down upon him, and thereafter fixes her gaze upon the
center of all light, but she sends St. Bernard to aid and comfort him.
Bernard directs Dante’s eyes to the Queen of Heaven; the poet looks, but
discerns only a flaming luster surrounded by thousands of angels clothed
in light. Bernard tells him that if he would obtain power to see the
heavenly vision more clearly he must join with him in prayer to the
Mother of God. The final canto opens with Ber- nard’s melodious
supplication:</p>
<p>Vergine Madre, figlia del tuo Figlio,</p>
<p>Umile ed alta piu che creatura —</p>
<p>“Virgin Mother, dau ghter of thy Son, more humble and exalted than
any creature.” Bernard begs her of her grace to enable Dante’s eyes to
behold the Divine Majesty. Beatrice and many saints bend toward Mary
with hands clasped in prayer. Mary looks for a moment benignly upon
Dante, then turns her eyes upon the “Everlasting Light.” Now, says the
poet, “my vision, be - coming pure, more and more entered the ray of
that high light which in itself is Truth.” What else he saw remains, he
says, beyond all human speech and fanta sy; but “in that abyss of
radiance, clear and lofty, seemed, methought,</p>
<p>io8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXI</p>
<p>Xthree orbs of triple hue, combined in one.” The majestic epic ends
with Dante’s gaze still fixed upon that radiance, drawn and impelled by
“the Love that moves the sun and all the stars.”</p>
<p>The Divine Comedy is the strangest and most difficult of all poems.
No other, before yielding its treasures, makes such imperious demands.
Its lan- guage is the most compact and concise this side of Horace and
Tacitus; it gathers into a word or phrase contents and subtleties
requiring a rich back- ground and an alert intelligence for full
apprehension; even the wearisome theological, psychological,
astronomical disquisitions have here a pithy pre- cision that only a
Scholastic philosopher could rival or enjoy. Dante lived so intensely in
his time that his poem almost breaks under the weight of con- temporary
allusions unintelligible today without a litter of notes obstructing the
movement of the tale.</p>
<p>He loved to teach, and tried to pour into one poem nearly all that he
had ever learned, with the result that the living verse lies abed with
dead absurdi- ties. He weakens the charm of Beatrice by making her the
voice of his politi- cal loves and hates. He stops his story to denounce
a hundred cities or groups or individuals, and at times his epic
founders in a sea of vituperation. He adores Italy; but Bologna is full
of panders and pimps, 59 Florence is the favorite product of Lucifer, 60
Pisto ia is a den of beasts, 61 Genoa is “full of all corruption,” 62
and as for Pisa, “A curse upon Pisa! May the Arno be dammed at its
mouth, and drown all Pisa, man and mouse, beneath its raging waters!” 63
Dante thinks that “supreme wisdom and primal love” created hell. He prom
- ises to remove the ice for a moment from the eyes of Alberigo if the
latter will tell his name and story; Alberigo does, and asks fulfillment
— “reach hither now thy hand, open my eyes!”— but, says Dante, “I opened
them not for him; to be rude to him was courtesy.” 64 If a man so bitter
could win a conducted tour through paradise we shall all be saved.</p>
<p>His poem is none the less the greatest of medieval Christian books,
and one of the greatest of all time. The slow accumulation of its
intensity through a hundred cantos is an experience that no thorough
reader will ever forget. It is, as Carlyle said, the sincerest of poems;
there is no pretense in it, no hypoc- risy or false modesty, no
sycophancy or cowardice; the most powerful men of the age, even a pope
who claimed all power, are attacked with a force and fervor unparalleled
in poetry. Above all there is here a flight and sustainment of
imagination challenging Shakespeare’s supremacy: vivid pictures of
things never seen by gods or men; descriptions of nature that only an
observant and sensitive spirit could achieve; and little narratives,
like Francesca’s or Ugo - lino’s, that press great tragedies into narrow
space with yet no vital matter</p>
<p>What Dante achieves at last is sublimity. We cannot find in his epic
the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIX ) DANTE 1 08 1</p>
<p>Mississippi of life and action that is the Iliad , nor the gentle
drowsy stream of Virgil’s verse, nor the universal understanding and
forgiveness of Shake - speare; but here is grandeur, and a tortured,
half-barbaric force that fore- shadows Michelangelo. And because Dante
loved order as well as liberty, and bound his passion and vision into
form, he achieved a poem of such sculp- tured power that no man since
has equaled it. Through the centuries that followed him Italy revered
him as the liberator of her golden speech; Petrarch and Boccaccio and a
hundred others were inspired by his battle and his art; and all Europe
rang with the story of the proud exile who had gone to’ hell, and had
returned, and had never smiled again.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>THE MEDIEVAL LEGACY</p>
<p>I T is fitting that we should end our long and devious narrative with
Dante;</p>
<p>for in the century of his death those men appeared who would begin to
destroy the majestic edifice of faith and hope in which he had lived:
Wyclif and Huss would preface the Reformation; Giotto and Chrysoloras,
Petrarch and Boccaccio would proclaim the Renaissance. In the history of
man — so multiple is he and diverse — one mood may survive in some souls
and places long after its successor or opposite has risen in other minds
or states. In Eu- rope the Age of Faith reached its last full flower in
Dante; it suffered a vital wound from Occam’s “razor” in the fourteenth
century; but it lingered, ailing, till the advent of Bruno and Galileo,
Descartes and Spinoza, Bacon and Hobbes; it may return if the Age of
Reason achieves catastrophe. Great areas of the world remained under the
sign and rule of faith while Western Europe sailed Reason’s uncharted
seas. The Middle Ages are a condition as well as a period: in Western
Europe we should close them with Columbus; in Russia they continued till
Peter the Great (d. 1725) ; in India till our time.</p>
<p>We are tempted to think of the Middle Ages as a fallow interval
between the fall of the Roman Empire in the West (476) and the discovery
of Amer- ica; we must remind ourselves that the followers of Abelard
called themselves moderni, and that the bishop of Exeter, in 1287, spoke
of his century as moderni tempores, “modem times.” 1 The boundary
between “medieval” and “modern” is always advancing; and our age of coal
and oil and sooty slums may some day be accounted medieval by an era of
cleaner power arid more gracious life. The Middle Ages were no mere
interlude between one civilization and another; if we date them from
Rome’s acceptance of Chris - tianity and the Council of Nicaea, a.d.
325, they included the final centuries of the classic culture, the
ripening of Catholic Christianity into a full and rich civilization in
the thirteenth century, and the breakup of that civilization into the
opposed cultures of the Renaissance and the Reformation. The men of the
Middle Ages were the victims of barbarism, then the conquerors of barba-
rism, then the creators of a new civilization. It would be unwise to
look down with hybritic pride upon a period that produced so many great
men and women, and raised from the ruins of barbarism the papacy, the
European states, and the hard-won wealth of our medieval heritage.*</p>
<ul>
<li>The following recapitulation is mostly confined to medieval
Christianity, and will not repeat the summary of Islamic civilization
given at the conclusion of Book II.</li>
</ul>
<p>1082</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>1083</p>
<p>That legacy included evil as well as good. We have not fully
recovered from the Dark Ages: the insecurity that excites greed, the
fear that fosters cruelty, the poverty that breeds filth and ignorance,
the filth that generates disease, the ignorance that begets credulity,
superstition, occultism — these still survive amongst us; and the
dogmatism that festers into intolerance and Inquisitions only awaits
opportunity or permission to oppress, kill, ravage, and destroy. In this
sense modernity is a cloak put upon medievalism, which secretly remains;
and in every generation civilization is the laborious product and
precarious obligating privilege of an engulfed minority. The Inquisition
left its evil mark on European society: it made torture a recognized
part of legal procedure, and it drove men back from the adventure of
reason into a fearful and stagnant conformity.</p>
<p>The preponderant bequest of the Age of Faith was religion: a Judaism
ab- sorbed till the eighteenth century in the Talmud; a Mohammedanism
be- calmed after the victory of the Koran over philosophy in the twelfth
century; a Christianity divided between East and West, between North and
South, and yet the most powerful and influential religion in the white
man’s history. The creed of the medieval Church is today (1950)
cherished by 330,000,000 Roman, 128,000,000 Orthodox, Catholics; her
liturgy stilf moves the soul after every argument has failed; and the
work of the Church in education, charity, and the moral taming of
barbaric man left to modernity a precious fund of social order and moral
discipline. The papal dream of a united Europe faded in the strife of
Empire and papacy; but every generation is stirred by a kindred vision
of an international moral order superior to the jungle ethics of
sovereign states.</p>
<p>When that papal dream broke, the nations of Europe took essentially
the form that they retained till our century; and the principle of
nationality pre- pared to write the political history of modern times.
Meanwhile the medieval mind created great systems of civil and canon
law, maritime and mercantile codes, charters of municipal freedom, the
jury system and habeas corpus, and the Magna Carta of the aristocracy.
Courts and curias prepared for states and Church modes and mechanisms of
administration employed to this day. Rep- resentative government
appeared in the Spanish Cortes, the Icelandic Al- thing, the French
Estates-General, the English Parliament.</p>
<p>Greater still was the economic heritage. The Middle Ages conquered
the wilderness, won the great war against forest, jungle, marsh, and
sea, and yoked the soil to the will of man. Over most of Western Europe
they ended slavery, and almost ended serfdom. They organized production
into guilds that even now enter into the ideals of economists seeking a
middle way be- tween the irresponsible individual and the autocratic
state. Tailors, cobblers, and dressmakers, until our own time, practiced
their handicrafts in personal shops after the medieval fashion; their
submission to large-scale production and capitalistic organization has
occurred under our eyes. The great fairs that</p>
<p>1084 THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>now and then gather men and goods in modern cities are a legacy of
medieval trade; so are our efforts to check monopoly and regulate prices
and wages; and nearly all the processes of modern banking were inherited
from medieval finance. Even our fraternities and secret societies have
medieval roots and rites.</p>
<p>Medieval morality was the heir of barbarism and the parent of
chivalry. Our idea of the gentleman is a medieval creation; and the
chivalric ideal, however removed from knightly practice, has survived as
one of the noblest conceptions of the human spirit. Perhaps the worship
of Mary brought new elements of tenderness into the behavior of European
man. If later centuries advanced upon medieval morality, it was on a
medieval foundation of family unity, moral education, and slowly
spreading habits of honor and courtesy- much as the moral life of modern
skeptics may be an afterglow of the Chris- tian ethic absorbed in
youth.</p>
<p>The intellectual legacy of the Middle Ages is poorer than our
Hellenic in- heritance, and is alloyed with a thousand occult
perversions mostly stemming from antiquity. Even so it includes the
modem languages, the universities, and the terminology of philosophy and
science. Scholasticism was a training in logic rather than a lasting
philosophical conquest, though it still dominates a thousand colleges.
The assumptions of medieval faith hampered historiog- raphy; men thought
they knew the origin and destiny of the world and man, and wove a web of
myth that almost imprisoned history within the walls of monastic
chronicles. It is not quite true that medieval historians had no notion
of development or progress; the thirteenth century, like the nineteenth,
was powerfully impressed by its own achievements. Nor were the Middle
Ages as static as we once proudly supposed; distance immobilizes motion,
assimilates differences, and freezes change; but change was as insistent
then as now, in manners and dress, language and ideas, law and
government, commerce and finance, literature and art. Medieval thinkers,
however, did not attach as much importance as the modern thoughtless to
progress in means unaccom- panied by improvement in ends.</p>
<p>The scientific legacy of the Middle Ages is modest indeed; yet it
includes the Hindu numerals, the decimal system, the conception of
experimental sci- ence, substantial contributions to mathematics,
geography, astronomy, and optics, the discovery of gunpowder, the
invention of eyeglasses, the mariner’s compass, the pendulum clock, and
— apparently the most indispensable of all — the distillation of
alcohol. Arabic and Jewish physicians advanced Greek medicine, and
Christian pioneers emancipated surgery from the tonsorial arts. Half the
hospitals of Europe are medieval foundations, or modern res- torations
of medieval establishments. Modern science has inherited the inter-
nationalism, and in part the international language, of medieval
thought.</p>
<p>Next to moral discipline, the richest portion of our medieval
heritage is in art. The Empire State Building is as sublime as Chartres
Cathedral, and owes</p>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>1085</p>
<p>its grandeur to architecture alone — to the stability of its
audacious height and the purity of its functional lines. But the union
of sculpture, painting, poetry, and music with architecture in the life
of a Gothic cathedral gives to Chartres, Amiens, Reims, and Notre Dame a
scope and depth of sensuous and spiritual harmony, a wealth and
diversity of content and ornament, that never lets our interest sleep,
and more fully fills the soul. These portals, towers, and spires, these
vaults that made a soaring counterpoint of stone, these statues, altars,
fonts, and tombs so fondly carved, these windows that rivaled the
rainbow and chastened the sun — one must forgive much to an age that
loved so con- scientiously the symbols of its faith and the work of its
hands. It was for the cathedrals that polyphonic music was developed,
and a musical notation and staff; and from the Church the modern drama
was born.</p>
<p>The medieval heritage in literature, though it cannot vie in quality
with that of Greece, may bear comparison with Rome’s. Dante may stand
beside Virgil, Petrarch beside Horace, the love poetry of the Arabs and
the trouba- dours beside Ovid, Tibullus, and Propertius; the Arthurian
romances are deeper and nobler than anything in the Metamorphoses or the
Heroides , and as graceful; and the major medieval hymns top the finest
lyrics of Roman poetry. The thirteenth century ranks with the age of
Augustus or of Leo X. Rarely has any century seen so full and varied an
intellectual or artistic flow- ering. A commercial expansion almost as
vigorous as that which marked the close of the fifteenth century
enlarged, enriched, and aroused the world; strong popes from Innocent
III to Boniface VIII made the Church for a cen- tury the summit of
European order and law; St. Francis dared to be a Chris- tian; the
mendicant orders restored the monastic ideal; great statesmen like
Philip Augustus, St. Louis, Philip IV, Edward I, Frederick II,
Alfonso</p>
<p>Xraised their states from custom to law, and their peoples to new
medieval levels of civilization. Triumphing over the mystical tendencies
of the twelfth century, the thirteenth sallied forth into philosophy and
science with a zest and courage not surpassed by the Renai ssance. In
literature the “wonderful century” ran the gamut from Wolfram von
Eschenbach’s Parzival to the conception of The Divine Comedy. Nearly all
elements of medieval civiliza- tion seemed in that century to reach
unity, maturity, and culminating form.</p>
<p>We shall never do justice to the Middle Ages until we see the Italian
Ren- aissance not as their repudiation but as their fulfillment.
Columbus and Magellan continued the explorations already far advanced by
the merchants and navigators of Venice, Genoa, Marseille, Barcelona,
Lisbon, and Cadiz. The same spirit that had stirred the twelfth century
gave pride and battle to the cities of Renaissance Italy. The same
energy and vitality of character that marked Enrico Dandolo, Frederick
II, and Gregory IX consumed the men of the Renaissance; the condottieri
stemmed from Robert Guiscard, the “despots” from Ezzelino and
Pallavicino; the painters walked in the paths opened by Cimabue and
Duccio; and Palestrina mediated between Gregorian</p>
<p>io86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>chant and Bach. Petrarch was the heir of Dante and the troubadours,
Boc- caccio was an Italian trouvere. Despite Don Quixote romance
continued to flourish in Renaissance Europe, and Chretien de Troyes came
to perfection in Malory. The “revival of letters” had begun in the
medieval schools; what</p>
<p>distinguished the Renaissance was that it extended the revival from
Latin to Greek classics, and rejected Gothic to revive Greek art. But
Greek sculpture had already been accepted as a model by Niccolo Pisano
in the thirteenth cen- tury; and when Chrysoloras brought the Greek
language and classics to Italy (1393) the Middle Ages had still a
century to run.</p>
<p>In Renaissance Italy, Spain, and France the same religion held sway
that had built the cathedrals and composed the hymns, with only this
difference, that the Italian Church, sharing richly in the culture of
the time, gave to the Italian mind a freedom of thought bom in the
medieval universities, and predicated on the tacit understanding that
philosophers and scientists would pursue their work without attempting
to destroy the faith of the people. So it was that Italy and France did
not share in the Reformation; they moved from the Catholic culture of
the thirteenth century to the humanism of the fifteenth and sixteenth,
and thence to the Enlightenment of the seven- teenth and eighteenth. It
was this continuity, combined with pre-Columbian Mediterranean trade,
that gave to the Latin peoples a temporary cultural advantage over
northern nations more severely ravaged by religious wars. That
continuity went back through the Middle Ages to classic Rome, and
through southern Italy to classic Greece. Through Greek colonies in
Sicily, Italy, and France, through the Roman conquest and Latinization
of France and Spain, one magnificent thread of culture ran, from Sappho
and Anacreon to Virgil and Horace, to Dante and Petrarch, to Rabelais
and Montaigne, to Voltaire and Anatole France. In passing from the Age
of Faith to the Renais- sance we shall be advancing from the uncertain
childhood to the lusty and exhilarating youth of a culture that married
classic grace to barbaric strength, and transmitted to us, rejuvenated
and enriched, that heritage of civilization to which we must always add,
but which we must never let die.</p>
