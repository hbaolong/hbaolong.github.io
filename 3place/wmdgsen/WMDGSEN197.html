North</h4>
<p>566-1066</p>
<p>I. ENGLAND: 577-1066</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Alfred and the Danes: 577-1016</li>
</ol>
<p>A FTER the battle of Deorham (577) the Anglo-Saxon-Jute conquest</p>
<p>L of England met with only minor resistance; and soon the
invaders</p>
<p>divided the country. The Jutes organized a kingdom in Kent; the
Angles formed three kingdoms — Mercia, Northumberland, and East Anglia;
the Saxons another three in Wessex, Essex, and Sussex — i.e., West,
East, and South Saxony. These seven little kingdoms, and others smaller
still, provided the “history of England” until King Egbert of Wessex, by
arms or subtlety, united most of them under his rule (829).</p>
<p>But even before this new Angle-land was molded by the Saxon king,
those Danish invasions had begun which were to rack the island from sea
to sea, and threaten its nascent Christianity with a wild and letterless
paganism. “In the year 787,” says the Anglo - Saxon Chronicle, “came
three ships to the West Saxon shores… and they slew folk. These were the
first ships of Dan- ish men that sought land of Engle folk.” In 793
another Danish expedition raided Northumberland, sacked the famous
monastery of Lindisfarne, and murdered its monks. In 794 the Danes
entered the Wear and pillaged Wear- mouth and Jarrow, where the learned
Bede had labored half a century be- fore. In 838 the raids attacked East
Anglia and Kent; in 839 a pirate fleet of 350 vessels moored in the
Thames, while their crews pillaged Canterbury and London. In 867
Northumberland was conquered by a force of Danes and Swedes; thousands
of “English” men were slain, monasteries were sacked, libraries were
scattered or destroyed. York and its neighborhood, whose school had
given Alcuin to Charlemagne, were reduced to destitution and ignorance.
By 87 1 most of England north of the Thames was subject to the invaders.
In that year a Danish army under Guthrum marched southward to attack
Reading, the Wessex capital; Ethelred the king and his young brother
Alfred met the Danes at Ashdown and won; but in a second engage- ment at
Merton Ethelred was mortally wounded, and the English fled.</p>
<p>Alfred mounted the throne of West Saxony at the age of twenty-two
(871). Asser describes him as then illiteratus, which could mean either
illiter-</p>

<p>484 the age of faith (chap. </p>
<p>XXate or Latinless. 1 He was apparently epileptic, and suffered a
seizure at his wedding feast; but he is pictured as a vigorous hunter,
handsome and grace- ful, and surpassing his brothers in wisdom and
martial skill. A month after his accession he led his little army
against the Danes at Wilton, and was so badly defeated that to save his
throne he had to buy peace from the foe; but in 878 he won a decisive
victory at Ethandun (Edington). Half the Danish host crossed the Channel
to raid weakened France; the rest, by the Peace of Wedmore, agreed to
confine themselves to northeastern England in what came to be called the
Danelaw.</p>
<p>Alfred, says the not quite reliable Asser, led his army into East
Anglia “for the sake of plunder,” conquered the land, and— perhaps to
unify England against the Danes — made himself king of East Anglia and
Mercia as well as of Wessex. Then, like a lesser Charlemagne, he turned
to the work of restora- tion and government. He reorganized the army,
built a navy, established a common law for his three kingdoms, reformed
the administration of justice, provided legal protection for the poor,
built or rebuilt cities and towns, and. erected “royal halls and
chambers with stone and wood” f or his growing governmental staff. 2 An
eighth of his revenue was devoted to relief of the poor; another eighth
to education. At Reading, his capital, he established a palace school,
and gave abundantly to the educational and religious work of churches
and monasteries. He recalled sadly how in his boyhood “the churches
stood filled with treasures and books… before they had all been ravaged
and burned” by the Danes; now “so clean was learning decayed</p>
<p>In 894 a fresh invasion of Danes reached Kent; the Danes of the
Danelaw sent them reinforcements; and the Welsh — Celtic patriots still
unconquered by the Anglo-Saxons — signed an alliance with the Danes.
Alfred’s son Ed - ward fell upon the pirate camp and destroyed it, and
Alfred’s new navy dis - persed the Danish fleet (899). Two years later
the King died, having lived only fifty-two years, and reigned for
twenty-eight. We cannot compare him with a giant like Charlemagne, for
the area of his enterprise was small; but in</p>

<p>485</p>
<p>his moral qualities — his piety, unassuming rectitude, temperance,
patience, courtesy, devotion to his people, anxiety to further education
— he offered to the English nation a model and stimulus that it
gratefully received and soon forgot. Voltaire admired him perhaps immod
erately: “I do not think that there ever was in the world a man more
worthy of the regard of posterity than Alfred the Great.” 4</p>
<p>Toward the end of the tenth century the Scandinavian attack on
England was resumed. In 991 a force of Norwegian Vikings under Olaf
Tryggvesson raided the English coast, plundered Ipswich, and defeated
the English at Maldon. Unable to resist further, the English under King
Ethelred (978 — 1013, called the Redeless — counselless — because he
refused the advice of his nobles) bought off the Danes with successive
gifts of 10,000, 16,000, 24,000, 36,000, and 48,000 pounds of silver,
which were raised by the first general taxes levied in England — the
shameful and ruinous Danegeld. Ethelred, seek- ing foreign aid,
negotiated an alliance with Normandy, and married Emma, daughter of the
Norman Duke Richard I; from that union would spring much history.
Believing or pretending that the Danes of England were plot- ting to
kill him and the nation’s Witenagemot or parliament, Ethelred se- cretly
ordered a general massacre of the Danes everywhere in the island (1002).
We do not know how thoroughly the order was carried out; prob- ably all
male Danes of arms-bearing age in England were slaughtered, and some
women; among these was the sister of King Sweyn of Denmark. Swear- ing
revenge, Sweyn invaded England in 1003, and again in 1013, this time
with all his forces. Ethelred’s nobles deserted him, he fled to
Normandy, and Sweyn was master and king of England. When Sweyn died
(1014) Ethel- red renewed the struggle; the nobles again deserted him,
and made their peace with Sweyn’s son Cnut (1015). Ethelred died in
besieged London; his son Edmund “Ironside” fought bravely, but was
overwhelmed by Cnut at Assandun (1016). Cnut was now accepted by all
England as its king, and the Danish Conquest was complete.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Anglo-Saxon Civilization: 577-1066</li>
</ol>
<p>The Conquest was only political; Anglo-Saxon institutions, speech,
and ways had in six centuries sunk such roots that to this day neither
the govern- ment nor the character nor the language of the English can
be understood without them. In the newsless intervals between war and
war, crime and crime, there had been a reorganization of tillage and
trade, a resurrection of literature, a slow formation of order and
law.</p>
<p>History gives no ground for the delusion that Anglo-Saxon England was
a paradise of free peasants living in democratic village communities.
The leaders of the Anglo-Saxon hosts appropriated the land; by the
seventh century a few</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXfamilies owned two thirds of the soil of England; 5 by the eleventh
century most towns were included in the property of a thane (noble), a
bishop, or the king. During the Danish invasions many peasants exchanged
ownership for protection; by 1000 the bulk of them paid rent in produce
or labor to some lord. 6 There were tun-moots or town meetings, and
folk-moots or hundred-moots that served as assemblies and courts for a
shire; but only landowners were allowed to attend these gatherings; and
after the eighth century they declined in authority and frequency, and
were largely replaced by the manorial courts of the lords. The
government of England lay essentially in the national Witenagemot
(“meeting o f the wise”)— a relatively small assemblage of thanes,
bishops, and the leading ministers of the Crown. Without the consent of
this incipient Parliament no English king could be chosen or sustained,
or add a rood to the personal estates from which he derived his regular
revenues; without it he could not legislate or tax or judge or wage war
or make peace. 7 The only resource of the monarchy against this
aristocracy lay in an informal alliance of throne and Church. The
English state before and after the Norman Conquest depended upon the
clergy for public education, social order, national unity, even for
political administra- tion. St. Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury, became
chief counselor under kings Edmund (940-6) and Edred (946-55). He
defended the middle and lower classes against the nobles, boldly
criticized monarchs and princes, was exiled by King Edwig (955-9), was
recalled by Edgar (959-75), and secured the crown for Edward the Martyr
(975- 8). He built St. Peter’s Church at Glastonbury, en - couraged
education and art, died (988) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and was
revered as England’s greatest saint before Thomas a Becket.</p>
<p>In this centrifugal government national law developed slowly, and the
old Germanic law, modified in phrase and circumstance, sufficed.
Compurgation, wergild, and ordeal survived, but trial by combat was
unknown. The w T ergild varied instructively in Anglian law: the fine or
composition-money for killing a king was 30,000 thrimsas (3,000); a
bishop, 15,000; a thane or a priest, 2,000; a ceorl or free peasant,
266. By Saxon law a man paid one or two shillings for inflicting a wound
an inch long, thirty shillings for slicing off an ear; it should be
added, however, that a shilling could buy a sheep. By the laws of
Ethelbert an adulterer was obliged to pay the husband a fine and buy him
another wife. 8 Any person who resisted a court order was declared an
“out - law”; his goods were forfeited to the king, and anyone might kill
him with impunity. In some cases wergild was not admitted, and severe
punishments were inflicted: enslavement, flogging, castration,
amputation — of hands, feet, upper lip, nose, or ear — and death by
hanging, beheading, burning, stoning, drowning, or precipitation into an
abyss. 9</p>
<p>The economy, like the law, was primitive, and far less developed than
in Roman Britain. Much work had been done in clearance and drainage, but
England in the ninth century was still half forest, heath, or fen; and
wild beasts — bears, boars, wolves — still lurked in the woods. The
farms were tilled mostly by bondmen or slaves. Men might fall into
slavery through debt or crime; wives and children could be sold into
slavery by husbands or fathers in need; and all the children of a slave,
even if begotten by freemen, were slaves. The owner might kill his
slave</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 487</p>
<p>at will. He might make a female slave pregnant, and then sell her.
The slave could not enter a suit at court. If a stranger slew him, the
modest wergild went to his master. If he fled and was caught he might be
flogged to death. 10 The main com- merce of Bristol was in slaves.
Nearly all the population was rural; towns were hamlets, and cities were
towns.* London, Exeter, York, Chester, Bristol, Glouces - ter, Oxford,
Norwich, Worcester, Winchester were small, but grew rapidly after
Alfred’s time. When Bishop Mellitus came to preach in London in 601 he
found only “a scanty and heathen population” 11 in what had been a
metropolis in Ro - man days. In the eighth century the city grew again
as a strategic point com- manding the Thames; under Canute it became the
national capital.</p>
<p>Industry usually worked for a local market; weaving and embroidery,
how- ever, were more advanced, and exported their products to the
Continent. Trans- port was difficult and dangerous; foreign commerce was
slight. The use of cattle as a medium of exchange survived till the
eighth century, but in that century several kings issued a silver
coinage of shillings and pounds. In tenth-century England four shillings
could buy a cow, six an ox. 12 Wages were commensurately low. The poor
lived in wooden thatched huts on a vegetarian diet; wheat bread and meat
were for the well-to-do, or a Sunday feast. The rich adorned their rude
castles with figured hangings, warmed themselves with furs, made their
garments gay with embroidery, and brightened their persons with
gems.</p>
<p>Manners and morals were not as prim or refined as in some later
periods of English history. We hear much about rudeness, coarseness,
brutality, lying, treachery, theft, and other hardy perennials; the
buccaneering Normans of 1066, including some bastards, professed to be
amazed at the low moral and cultural level of their victims. The moist
climate persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to heavy eating and hard drinking,
and the “ale feast” was their notion— like ours — of a convention or a
holiday. St. Boniface, with picturesque exaggeration, described the
eighth- century English, “both Christians and pagans, as refusing to
have legitimate wives, and continuing to live in lechery and adultery
after the manner of neighing horses and braying asses”; 13 and in 756 he
wote to King Ethelbald:</p>
<p>Your contempt for lawful matrimony, were it for chastity’s sake,</p>
<p>would be laudable; but since you wallow in luxury, and even in adul-
tery with nuns, it is disgraceful and damnable We have heard that</p>
<p>almost all the nobles of Mercia follow your example, desert their
law- ful wives, and live in guilty intercourse with adulteresses and
nuns.</p>
<p>… Give heed to this: if the nation of the Angles,… despising lawful
matrimony, gives free indulgence to adultery, a race ignoble and</p>
<p>scorning God must necessarily issue from such unions, and will
de-</p>
<p>stroy the country by their abandoned manners. 14</p>
<p>In the earlier centuries of Anglo-Saxon rule the husband could
divorce his wife at will, and remarry. The Synod of Hertford (673)
denounced this custom, and gradually the influence of the Church
promoted the stability of unions. Women were held in high honor, though
this did not preclude their occasional</p>

handicap in attracting and influencing men. Kings patiently wooed proud
women, and consulted their wives on public policy. 15 Alfred’s daughter
Ethelfled, as regent</p>
<p>Education, like everything else, suffered from the Anglo-Saxon
Conquest, and slowly recovered after the conversion of the conquerors.
Benedict Biscop opened a monastic school at Wearmouth about 660; Bede
was one of its graduates. Arch- bishop Egbert established at York (735)
a cathedral school and library that be- came the chief seat of secondary
education in England. These and other schools made England in the second
half of the eighth century the leader of European learning north of the
Alps.</p>
<p>The fine devotion of the monastic educators shines out in the
greatest scholar of his time, the Venerable Bede (673-735). He summed up
his life with modest brevity:</p>
<p>Bede, the servant of Christ, a priest of the monastery of the blessed
apostles Peter and Paul, which is at Wearmouth and Jarrow. Who,</p>
<p>being born in the territory of that monastery, was delivered up
by</p>
<p>my kinsfolk, when I was seven years of age, to be brought up by the
most reverend abbot Benedict [Biscop] ; and from that time spending all
the days of my life in the same monastery, I have applied all my</p>
<p>diligence to the study of the Scriptures; and observing the
regular</p>
<p>discipline, and keeping the daily service of singing in the church,
I</p>
<p>have taken delight always either to learn, or to teach, or to
write….</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year of my life I was made deacon; in my thirtieth
I became a priest… and from that time until the fifty-ninth year of</p>
<p>my age I have employed myself upon Holy Scripture, and in these</p>
<p>following works.. , 17</p>
<p>— all in Latin. They included Biblical commentaries, homilies, a
chronology of world history, treatises on grammar, mathematics, science,
and theology, and above all, the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum
, or Church History of the Etiglish Nation (731). Unlike most monastic
histories, this is no dry chronicle. Perhaps, towards the end, it is too
heavy with miracles, and always it is inno- cently credulous, as
befitted a mind immured from the age of seven; nevertheless it is a
clear and captivating narrative, rising now and then to a simple
eloquence, as in the description of the Anglo-Saxon Conquest. 18 Bede
had an intellectual</p>
<ul>
<li>Leofric, in the legend, agreed to relieve the town of a burdensome
tax if she would ride naked through the streets. All the world knows the
rest of the story.</li>

<p>conscience; he took great pains with chronology, and is generally
accurate; he specified his sources, sought firsthand evidence, and
quoted pertinent and avail- able documents. “I would not,” he said,
“that my children should read a lie” 19 — meaning, we hope, the 600
pupils whom he taught. He died four years after pen- ning the above
autobiography; and all the tenderness and faith of medieval piety are in
its concluding lines:</p>
<p>And I beseech Thee, merciful Jesus, that to whom Thou hast of</p>
<p>Thy goodness given sweetly to drink in the words of the knowledge</p>
<p>of Thee, Thou wilt also vouchsafe, in Thy loving kindness, that
he</p>
<p>may one day come to Thee, the fountain of all wisdom, and stand</p>
<p>forever before Thy face.</p>
<p>Bede notes that five languages were spoken in his England: English,
British (Celtic), Irish, Piet (Scotch), and Latin. “English” was the
language of the - sion of this idea. Usually these old poems sing
blithely and lustily of war; the “Lay of the Battle of Maldon” (
c. 1000) sees only heroism in the English defeat; and the old warrior
Byrh twold, standing over his slain lord, “taught courage” to the
overwhelmed Saxons in words presaging Malory:</p>
<p>Thought shall be the harder, heart the keener, mood shall be the</p>
<p>more, as our might lessens. Here our prince lies low, they have hewn
him to death! Grief and sorrow forever on the man that leaves this</p>
<p>war-play! I am old of years, but hence I will not go; I think to lay
me</p>
<p>down by the side of my lord, by the side of the man I cherished.
21</p>
<p>The longest and noblest of the Anglo-Saxon poems, Beowulf, was
composed, presumably in England, in the seventh or eighth century, and
is preserved in a British Museum manuscript dating back to 1000. Its
3183 lines are apparently the</p>
<p>49° the age of faith (chap. xx</p>
<p>complete work. The verse is rhymeless but alliterative antistrophic
rhythm, in a West Saxon dialect quite unintelligible to us today. The
story seems childish: Beowulf, prince of the Geats (Goths?) in southern
Sweden, crosses the sea to free the Danish King Hrothgar from the dragon
Grendel; he overcomes Grendel, and even Grendel’s mother; sails back to
Geatland, and reigns justly for fifty years. A third dragon, a
firedrake, now appears, and ravages the land of the Geats; Beowulf
attacks it, and is seriously wounded, his comrade Wiglaf comes to his
aid, and together they kill the beast. Beowulf dies of his wound, and is
burned on a funeral pyre. The tale is not so naive as this sounds; the
dragons of medieval literature represent the wild beasts that lurked in
the woods about the towns of Europe; the terrified imagination of the
people might be forgiven for conceiving them fantastically; and it
gratefully wove legends about the men who conquered such animals, and
made the hamlets safe.</p>
<p>Certain passages of the poem are incongruously Christian, as if some
kindly monkish editor had sought to preserve a heathen masterpiece by
inserting here and there a pious line. But the tone and incidents are
purely pagan. It was life and love and battle on the earth that
interested these “fair women and brave men,” not some strifeless*
paradise beyond the grave. At the outset, when the Danish king Scyld is
buried in the Viking style, in a boat pushed crewless out to sea, the
author adds: “Men cannot tell for a truth who received that burden.” But
it was not a gay paganism. A somber tone pervades the poem, and enters
even into the feasting in Hrothgar’s hall. Through the lilt and sigh of
the flowing lines we catch the plaint of the gleeman’s harp.</p>
<p>Then Beowulf sat down on a seat by the wall… he talked of his</p>
<p>wound, of the hurt sore unto death; he knew well that he had ended
his days…. Then men bold in battle rode about the burial mound;</p>
<p>They were minded to utter their grief, to lament the King, to make a
chant and speak of the man; they exalted his heroic life, and praised
his valorous deeds with all their strength…. They said that among</p>
<p>he kings of the world he was the mildest of men and most kindly,</p>
<p>most gentle to his people, and most eager for praise…. Thus it is
fit- ting that a man should extol his friendly lord… and should love him
heartily, when he must needs depart from his body and pass away. 22</p>
<p>Beowulf is probably the oldest extant poem in the literature of
Britain; but Caedmon’s (d. 680) is the oldes t name. We know him only
through a pretty passage in Bede. In the monastery of Whitby, says the
Ecclesiastical History , 23 was a simple brother who found it so hard to
sing that whenever his turn came to chant he fled to some hiding place.
One night as he lay asleep in his stable lair, it seemed to him that an
angel appeared and said: “Caedmon, sing me some - thing!” The monk
protested that he could not; the angel commanded; Caedmon tried, and was
startled at his success. In the morning he recalled the song, and sang
it; thereafter he lisped in numbers, and turned Genesis, Exodus, and the
Gospels into verse “put together,” says Bede, “with very great sweetness
and pricking of the heart.” Nothing remains of them except a few lines
translated into Latin by Bede. A year later Cynewulf (b. o. 750),
minstrel at a Northum-</p>

<p>brian court, tried to realize the story by versifying divers
religious narratives — “Christ,” “Andreas,” “Juliana”; but these works,
contempora ry with Beowulf , are by comparison dead with rhetoric and
artifice.</p>
<p>Literary prose comes later than poetry in all literatures, as
intellect matures long after fancy blooms; men talk prose for centuries
“without knowing it,” before they have leisure or vanity to mold it into
art. Alfred is the first clear figure in the prose literature of
England; his translations and prefaces were elo- quent through simple
sincerity; and it was he who, by dint of editing and adding, transformed
the “Bishop’s Roll,” kept by the clerks of Winchester cathedral, into
the most vigorous and vivid sections of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle — the
first substantial work of English prose. His teacher Asser may have
written most of the Life of Alfred ; perhaps it is a later compilation (
c. 974); 24 in any event it is an early instance of the readiness with
which Englishmen used English instead of Latin for works of history or
theology, while the Continent still blushed to write such dignities in
the “vulgar” speech.</p>
<p>Even amid poetry and war men and women found time and spirit to give
form to significance, and beauty to things of use. Alfred established a
school of art at Athelney, brought to it from all quarters monks skilled
in arts and crafts, and “continued, during his frequent wars,” says
Asser, “to teach his workers in gold, and his artificers of all kinds.”
25 Dunstan, not content with being both a statesman and a saint, worked
cleverly in metal and gold, was a good musician, and built a pipe organ
for his cathedral at Glastonbury. Art work in wood, metal, and cloisonne
enamel was carried on; gem-cutters joined with carvers to make the
jeweled and sculptured crosses of Ruthwell and Bewcastle ( c. 700); a
famous equestrian statue of King Cadwallo (d. 677) was cast in brass
near Ludgate; women made coverlets and tapestries and embroideries “of a
most delicate thread”; 26 the monks of Winchester illuminated with
radiant color a tenth - century benedictional. Winchester itself and
York built stone cathedrals as early as 635; Benedict Biscop brought the
Lombard style to England from the church that he built at Wearmouth in
674; and Canterbury rebuilt in 950 the cathedral that had survived from
Roman times. We know from Bede that Benedict Biscop’s church was ado
rned with paintings made in Italy, “so that all who entered, even if
ignorant of letters, whichever way they turned, should either
contemplate the ever-lovely aspect of Christ and His saints… or, having
the Last Judgment before their eyes, might reme mber to examine
themselves more strictly.” 27 In general the seventh century saw an
exuberance of construction in Britain; the Anglo- Saxon Conquest was
complete, the Danish had not begun; and architects, who had heretofore
built in wood, now had the resources and spirit to raise great shrines
in stone. Yet it must be confessed that Benedict imported his
architects, glassmakers, and goldsmiths from Gaul; Bishop Wilfrid
brought sculptors and painters from Italy to decorate his
seventh-century church at Hexham; and the beautifully illuminated Gospel
Book of Lindisfarne ( c. 730) was the work of Irish monks transplanted
by the eremitical or missionary zeal to that bleak isle off the
Northumberland coast. The coming of the Danes ended this brief
renascence; and not until the sound establishment of Cnut’s power did
English architecture resume its climb to majesty.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XX3. Between Conquests : 1016-1066</p>
<p>Cnut was more than a conqueror; he was a statesman. His early reign
was tarnished with cruelty: he banished the children of Edmund
Ironsides, and had Edmund’s brother murdered to forestall an Anglo
-Saxon restoration. But then, noting that the widow and sons of King
Ethelred were alive at Rouen, he cut many knots by offering Emma his
hand in marriage (1017). She was thirty-three, he twenty-three. She
consented, and at one stroke Cnut secured a wife, an alliance with
Emma’s brother the Duke of Nor - mandy, and a safe throne. From that
moment his reign became a blessing for England. He brought under
discipline the disorderly nobles who had broken the unity and spirit of
England. He protected the island from further inva- sion, and gave it
twelve years of peace. He accepted Christianity, built many churches,
raised a shrine at Assandun to commemorate the Anglo-Saxons, as well as
the Danes, who had fought there, and himself made a pilgrimage to
Edmund’s tomb. He promised to follow the existing laws and institutions
of England, and kept his word with two exceptions: he insisted that
county government, which had been debased by autocratic nobles, should
be under his own appointees; and he replaced the archbishop with a lay
minister as chief counselor to the Crown. He developed an administrative
staff and civil service that gave unprecedented continuity to the
government. After the in- secure early years of his rule, nearly all his
appointees were Englishmen. He labored constantly in the tasks of state,
and repeatedly visited every part of his kingdom to supervise the
administration of justice and the execution of the laws. He came in as a
Dane, and died as a Englishman. He was King of Denmark as well as of
England, and in 1 028 he became also King of Norway; but it was from
Winchester that he ruled this triple realm.</p>
<p>The Danish Conquest continued that long process of foreign invasion
and racial mixture which culminated in the Norman Conquest and finally
pro- duced the English people. Celt and Gaul, Angle and Saxon and Jute,
Dane and Norman, mingled their blood, in marriage or otherwise, to
transform the undistinguished and uninitiative Briton of Roman days into
the vocal buc- caneers of Elizabeth’s time, and the silent world
conquerors of later centu - ries. The Danes, like the Germans and the
Norse, brought into England an almost mystic love of the sea, a
willingness to accept its treacherous invitation to adventure and trade
in distant lands. Culturally, the Danish invasions were a blight.
Architecture marked time; the art of illumination decayed from 750 to
950; and the intellectual progress so promoted by Alfred was checked,
even as in Gaul Norse raids were canceling the labors of
Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Cnut might have repaired more of the damage his people had wrought
had he been granted a longer life. But men wear out rapidly in war or

<p>ment. Cnut died in 1035, aged forty. Norway at once threw off the
Danish yoke; Harthacnut, Cnut’s son and appointed heir, had all he could
do to pro - tect Denmark against Norwegian invasion; another son, Harald
Harefoot, ruled England for five years, then died; Harthacnut ruled it
for two years, and passed away ( 1042). Before his death he summoned
from Normandy the surviving son of Ethelred and Emma, and recognized
this Anglo-Saxon step- brother as heir to the English throne.</p>
<p>But Edward the Confessor (1042-66) was as much of a foreigner as any
Dane. Carried to Normandy by his father at the age of ten, he had passed
thirty years at the Norman court, brought up by Norman nobles and
priests, and trained to a guileless piety. He brought to England his
French speech, customs, and friends. These friends became high officials
and prelates of the state, received royal grants, built Norman castles
in England, showed their scorn for English language and ways, and began
the Norman Conquest a generation before the Conqueror.</p>
<p>Only one Englishman could compete with them in influencing the mild
and malleable King. Earl Godwin, governor of Wessex, and first counselor
of the realm under Cnut, Harald, and Harthacnut, was a man of both
wealth and wisdom, a master of patient diplomacy, of convincing
eloquence and administrative skill; the first great lay statesman in
English history. His expe- rience in the government gave him an
ascendancy over the King. His daugh- ter Edith became Edward’s wife, and
might have made Godwin grandfather</p>
<p>Harold was appointed Earl of Wessex, and succeeded in some measure to
his fathe r’s power. He was now thirty -one, tall, handsome, strong,
gallant, reckless; merciless in war, generous in peace. In a whirlwind
of bold cam- paigns he conquered Wales for England, and presented the
head of the Welsh chieftain Gruffydd to the pleased and horrified King
(1063). In a</p>

<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXgentler phase of his impetuous career he poured out funds to build
the abbey church at Waltham ( 1060), and to support the college that
grew out of the cathedral school. All England beamed upon the romantic
youth.</p>
<p>The great architectural event of Edward’s reign was the beginning
(1055) of Westminster Abbey. While living in Rouen he had become
familiar with the Norman style; now, in commissioning the abbey that was
to be the shrine and tomb of England’s genius, he bade or let it be
designed in Norman Romanesque, on the same lines as the magnificent
abbey church which had been started only five years before at Jumieges;
here again was a Norman conquest before William. Westminster Abbey was
the beginning of an ar- chitectural efflorescence that would give
England the finest Romanesque buildings in Europe.</p>
<p>In that abbey Edward was laid to rest early in the fateful year 1066.
On January 6 the assembled Witenagemot elected Harold king. He had
hardly been crowned when news came that William, Duke of Normandy,
claimed the throne and was preparing war. Edward, said William, had in
1051 prom- ised to bequeath him the English crown in gratitude for
thirty years of pro- tection in Normandy. Apparently the promise had
been made, 28 but Ed- ward, regretting or forgetting it, had, shortly
before his death, recommended Harold as his successor; in any case such
a promise had no validity unless approved by the Witan. But, said
William, Harold, on a visit to him at Rouen (date now unknown), had
accepted knighthood from him, had become William’s “man,” owed him
submission according to feudal law, and had promised to recognize and
support him as heir to Edward’s throne. Harold admitted this pledge. 29
But again no oath of his could bind the English na- tion; the
representatives of that nation had freely chosen him for its king; and
Harold now resolved to defend that choice. William appealed to the Pope;
Alexander II, counseled by Hildebrand, condemned Harold as a usurper,
excommunicated him and his adherents, and declared William the lawful
claimant of the English throne; he blessed William’s proposed inva -
sion, and sent him a consecrated banner and a ring containing, within a
dia- mond, a hair of St. Peter’s head. 30 Hildebrand was glad to set a
precedent for the papal disposition of thrones and deposition of kings;
ten years later he would apply the precedent to Henry IV of Germany; and
it would come in handy in 1213 with King John. Lanfranc, Abbot of Bee,
joined William in calling the people of Normandy — indeed of all
countries — to a holy war against the excommunicated king.</p>
<p>The sins of Harold’s wild youth were now visited upon his benevolent
maturity. His brother Tostig, long since exiled by the Witan, had not
been recalled by Harold come to power. Tostig now allied himself with
William, raised an army in the north, and persuaded King Harald Hardrada
of Nor- way to join him by promising him the English throne. In
September, 1066, as William’s armada of 1400 vessels sailed from
Normandy, Tostig and</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>Hardrada invaded Northumberland. York surrendered to them, and Har-
drada was there crowned King of England. Harold rushed up with what
troops he had, and defeated the northern invaders at Stamford Bridge
(Sep- tember 25); in that battle Tostig and Hardrada died. Harold moved
south with a diminished force far too small to pit against William’s
host, and every adviser bade him wait. But William was burning and
harrowing southern England, and Harold felt bound to defend the soil
that he once had ravaged but now loved. At Senlac, near Hastings, the
two armies met (October 14), and fought for nine hours. Harold, his eye
pierced by an arrow, fell blinded with blood, and was’dismembered by
Norman knights: one cut off his head, another a leg, another scattered
Harold’s entrails over the field. When the English saw their captain
fallen they fled. So great were the butchery and chaos that the monks
who were later commissioned to find Harold’s body could not discover him
until they led to the scene Edith Swansneck, who had been his mistress.
She identified her lover’s mutilated body, and the fragments were buried
in the church at Waltham that he had built. On Christmas Day, 1066,
William I was crowned King of England.</p>

<li>wales: 325-1066</li>
</ol>
<p>Wales had been won for Rome by Frontinus and Agricola a.d. 78. When
the Romans retired from Britain, Wales resumed its freedom, and suffered
its own kings. In the fifth century western Wales was occupied by Irish
set- tlers; later Wales received thousands of Britons fleeing from the
Anglo- Saxon conquerors of their island. The Anglo-Saxons stopped at the
Welsh barrier, and called the unsubdued people Wealhas — 1 “foreigners.”
The Irish and the Britons found in Wales a kindred Celtic stock, and
soon the three groups mingled as Cymri — “fellow countrymen”; this
became their national name, and Cymru their name for their land. Like
most Celtic peoples — Bretons, Cornish, Irish, the Gaels of northern
Scotland — they based their social order almost wholly on the family and
the clan, and so jealously that they resented the state, and looked with
unappeasable distrust upon any indi- vidual or people of alien blood.
Their clan spirit was balanced by uncalculat- ing hospitality, their
indiscipline by bravery, their hard life and climate by music and song
and loyal friendship, their poverty by an imaginative senti- ment that
made every girl a princess, and every second man a king.</p>
<p>Only next to kings stood the bards. They were the soothsayers,
historians, and royal counselors, as well as the poets, of their people.
Two among them left enduring names — Taliesin and Aneurin, both of the
sixth century; there were hundreds more; and the tales they spun crossed
the Channel to Brittany to reach polished form in France. The bards
constituted a poetic clerical caste; no one was admitted to their order
except after strict training in the lore of</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXheir race. The candidate for admission was called a mabinog; the
material he studied was mabinogi; hence the name Mabinogion for such of
their tales as have survived. 31 In their present form they are not
older than the fourteenth century, but probably they go back to this
period, when Christianity had not taken Wales. They are primitively
simple, paganly animistic, and weird with strange animals and marvelous
events; overcast with a somber certainty of exile, defeat, and death,
yet in a mood of gentleness all the world away from the lust and
violence of Icelandic Eddas, Norse sagas, and the Nibe- lungenlied. In
the loneliness of Welsh mountains there grew a romantic lit- erature of
devotion to the nation, to woman, and, later, to Mary and Jesus, that
shared in begetting chivalry, and those wondrous tales of Arthur and his
valorous- amorous knights sworn to “break the heathen and uphold the
Christ.”</p>
<p>Christianity came to Wales in the sixth century, and soon thereafter
opened schools in the monasteries and cathedrals. The learned Bishop
Asser, who served King Alfred as secretary and biographer, came from the
town and cathedral of St. David’s in Pembrokeshire. These Christian
shrines and settlements bore the brunt of pirate attacks from Normandy,
until King Rhodri the Great (844-78) drove them off and gave the island
a vigorous dynasty. King Hywel the Good (910-50) united all Wales, and
provided it with a uniform code of laws. Gruff ydd ap Llywelyn ( 1
039-63 ) was too suc- cessful; when he defeated Mercia, the nearest of
the English counties, Har- old, the future king of England, proclaimed a
war of preventive defense, and conquered Wales for Britain (1063).</p>
<p>hi. Irish civilization: 461-1066</p>
<p>At the death of St. Patrick, and until the eleventh century, Ireland
was divided into seven kingdoms: three in Ulster, the others Connaught,
Leinster, Munster, Meath. Normally these kingdoms fought among
themselves, for lack of transport to wider spheres of strife; but from
the third century on- ward we hear of Irish raids and settlements on
west British coasts. The chron- iclers call these raiders Scots —
apparently a Celtic word for wanderers; throughout this period “Scot”
means Irishman. War was ende mic: till 590 the women, till 804 the monks
and priests, were required to fight alongside more ordinary warriors. 33
A code of laws essentially similar to the “barbar - ian” codes of the
Continent was administered by brehons — highly trained lawyer- judges
who, as early as the fourth century, taught law schools and wrote legal
treatises in the Gaelic tongue. 33 Ireland, like Scotland, missed
conquest by Rome, and therefore missed the boon of Roman law and orderly
government; law never quite succeeded in replacing vengeance with judg-
ment, or passion with discipline. Government remained basically tribal,
and only at moments achieved a national unity and scope.</p>
<p>CHAP. XX ) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 497</p>
<p>The unit of society and economy was the family. Several families made
a sept, several septs a clan, several clans a tribe. All members of a
tribe were supposedly descended from a common ancestor. In the tenth
century many families prefixed Ui or O’ (grandson) to a tribal name to
indicate their de - s cent; so the O’Neills claimed descent from Niall
Glundubh, King of Ire - land in 916. Many others assumed their father’s
name, merely prefixing Mac — i.e., son. Most of the land in the seventh
century was owned in common by clans or septs; 34 private property was
limited to household goods; 35 but by the tenth century individual
ownership had spread. Soon there was a small aristocracy holding large
estates, a numerous class of free peasants, a small class of renters, a
still smaller class of slaves. 36 Materially and politically the Irish
in the three centuries after the coming of Christianity (461-750) were
more backward than the English; culturally they were probably the most
advanced of all the peoples north of the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>This strange imbalance had many sources: the influx of Gallic and
British scholars fleeing from the Germanic invasions of the fifth
century, the growth of commercial contacts with Britain and Gaul, and
the exemption of Ireland, before the ninth century, from foreign attack.
Monks and priests and nuns opened schools of every scope and degree; one
at Clonard, established in 520, had 3000 students (if we may believe
patriotic historians) ; 37 there were others at Clonmacnois (544),
Clonfert (55 o), and Bangor (560). Several gave a twelve-year course
leading to the doctorate in philosophy, and includ- ing Biblical
studies, theology, the Latin and Greek classics, Gaelic grammar and
literature, mathematics and astronomy, history and music, medicine and
law. 38 Poor scholars whose parents could not support them were
maintained by public funds, for most students were preparing for the
priesthood, and the Irish made every sacrifice to further that vocation.
These schools con- tinued the study of Greek long after knowledge of
that language had almost disappeared from the other countries of Western
Europe. Alcuin studied at Clonmacnois; in Ireland John Scotus Erigena
learned the Greek that. made him the marvel of the court of Charles the
Bald in France.</p>
<p>The mood and literature of the age favored legend and romance. Here
and there some minds turned to science, like the astronomer Dungal, or
the geometer Fergil, who taught the sphericity of the earth. About 825
the geographer Dicuil reported the discovery of Iceland by Irish monks
in 795, and exemplified the midnight day of the Irish summer by noting
that one could then find light enough to pick the fleas from his shirt.
30 Grammarians were numerous, if only because Irish prosody was the most
complicated of its time. Poets abounded, and held high state in society;
usually they com- bined the functions of teacher, lawyer, poet, and
historian. Grouped in bardic schools around some leading poet, they
inherited many of the powers and prerogatives of the pre-Christian Druid
priests. Such bardic schools flourished without a break from the sixth
to the seventeenth century, usually</p>
<p>49^ THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXsupported by grants of land from Church or state. 40 The tenth
century had four nationally know n poets: Flann MacLonain, Kenneth
O’Hartigan,</p>
<p>Eochaid O’Flainn, and that MacLiag whom King Brian Boru made arch -
ollamh, or poet laureate.</p>
<p>In this age the sagas of Ireland took literary form. Much of their
material antedated Patrick, but had been transmitted orally; now it was
put into a running mixture of rhythmic prose and ballad verse; and
though it has reached us only in manuscripts later than the eleventh
century, it is the poets of this period who made it literature. One
cycle of sagas commemorated the mythical ancestors of the Irish people.
A “Fenian” or “Ossianic” cycle re - counted in stirring stanzas the
adventures of the legendary hero Finn Mac- Cumhail and his descendants
the Fianna or Fenians. Most of these poems were ascribed by trad ition
to Finn’s son Ossian, who, we are informed, lived 300 years, and died in
St. Patrick’s time after giving the saint a piece of his pagan mind. An
“Heroic” cycle centered around the old Irish king Cuchu - lain, who
encounters war and love in a hundred lusty scenes. The finest saga of
this series told the story of Deirdre, daughter of Felim, King Conor’s
lead - ing bard. At her birth a Druid priest prophesies that she will
bring many sor- rows to her land of Ulster; the people cry out “Let her
be slain,” but King Conor protects her, rears her, and plans to marry
her. Day by day she grows in loveliness. One morning she sees the
handsome Naoise playing ball with other youths; she retrieves a
misthrown ball and hands it to him, and “he pressed my han d joyously.”
The incident touches off her ripe emotions, and she begs her handmaid,
“O gentle nurse, if you wish me to live, take a mes - sage to him, and
tell him to come and talk with me secretly tonight.” Naoise comes, and
drinks in her beauty to intoxication. On the following night he and his
two brothers, Ainnle and Ardan, take the willing Deirdre out of the
palace and across the sea to Scotland. A Scotch king falls in love with
her, and the brothers hide her in the highlands. After some time King
Conor sends a message: he will forgive them if they will come back to
Erin. Naoise, long- ing for his native soil and youthful haunts,
consents, though Deirdre warns him and foretells treachery. After
reaching Ireland they are attacked by Conor’s sold iers; the brothers
fight bravely, but are all killed; and Deirdre, insane with grief,
flings herself upon the ground, drinks the blood of her dead lover, and
sings a strange dirge:</p>
<p>On a day that the nobles of Alba [Scotland] were feasting…</p>
<p>To the daughter of the lord of Duntrone</p>
<p>Naoise gave a secret kiss.</p>
<p>He sent her a frisky doe,</p>
<p>A deer of the forest with a faun at its foot,</p>
<p>And he went aside to her on a visit</p>
<p>While returning from the host of Inverness.</p>
<p>But when I heard that,</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>My head filled with jealousy,</p>
<p>I launched my little skiff upon the waves;</p>
<p>I did not care whether I died or lived.</p>
<p>They followed me, swimming,</p>
<p>Ainnle and Ardan, who never uttered falsehood,</p>
<p>And they turned me in to land again,</p>
<p>Two who would subdue a hundred.</p>
<p>Naoise pledged me his word of truth,</p>
<p>And he swore in presence of his weapons, three times,</p>
<p>That he would never cloud my countenance again</p>
<p>Till he should go from me to the army of the dead.</p>
<p>Alas! if she were to hear this night</p>
<p>That Naoise was under cover in the clay,</p>
<p>She would weep most certainly,</p>
<p>And I, I would weep with her sevenfold.</p>
<p>The oldest version of “Deirdre of the Sorrows” ends with a powerful
sim - plicity: “There was a large roc k near. She hurled her head at the
stone, so that she broke her skull and was dead.” 41</p>
<p>Poetry and music were near allied in Ireland, as elsewhere in
medieval life. Girls sang as they wove or spun or milked the cow; men
sang as they plowed the field or marched to war; missionaries strummed
the harp to muster an audience. The favorite instruments were the harp,
usually of thirty strings, plucked with the finger tips; the timpan, an
eight-string violin played with plectrum or bow; and the bagpipe, slung
from the shoulder and inflated by the breath. Giraldus Cambrensis ( 1
185) judged the Irish harpers the best he had ever heard — a high
tribute from music-loving Wales.</p>
<p>The finest product of Irish art in this period was not the famous
Ardagh chalice ( c. 1000) — an astonishing union of 354 pieces of
bronze, silver, gold, amber, crystal, cloisonne enamel, and glass; it
was the “Book of Kells”— the Four Gospels in vellum, done by Irish monks
at Kells in Meath, or on the isle of Iona, in the ninth century, and now
the prize possession of Trinity Col- lege, Dublin. Through the slow
intercommunication of monks across fron- tiers, Byzantine and Islamic
styles of illumination entered Ireland, and for a moment reached
perfection there. Here, as in Moslem miniatures, human or animal figures
played an insignificant role; none was worth half an initial. The spirit
of this art lay in taking a letter, or a single ornamental motive, out
of a background of blue or.gold, and drawing it out with fanciful humor
and delight till it almost covered the page with its labyrinthine web.
Nothing in Christian illuminated manuscripts surpasses the Book of
Kells. Gerald of Wales, though always jealous of Ireland, called it the
work of angels mas- querading as men. 42</p>
<p>As this golden age of Ireland had been made possible by freedom from
the Germanic invasions that threw the rest of Latin Europe back by many
cen- turies, so it was ended by such Norse raids as in the ninth and
tenth centuries</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXannulled in France and England the progress so laboriously made by
Charle- magne and Alfred. Perhaps the news had reached Norway and
Denmark — both still pagan — that the Irish monasteries were rich in
gold, silver, and jewelry, and that the political fragmentation of
Ireland forestalled united resistance. An experimental raid came in 795,
did little damage, but con- firmed the rumor of this unguarded prey. In
823 greater invasions plundered Cork and Cloyne, destroyed the
monasteries of Bangor and Moville, and massacred the clergy. Thereafter
raids came almost every year. Sometimes brave little armies drove them
back, but they returned, and sacked monas- teries everywhere. Bands of
Norse invaders settled near the coast, founded Dublin, Limerick, and
Waterford, and levied tribute from the northern half of the island.
Their King Thorgest made St. Patrick’s Armagh his pagan capital, and
enthroned his heathen wife on the altar of St. Kieran’s Church at
Clonmacnois. 43 The Irish kings fought the invaders separately, but at
the same time they fought one another. Malachi, King of Meath, captured
Thorgest and drowned him (845) ; but in 851 Olaf the White, a Norwegian
prince, established the kingdom of Dublin, which remained Norse till the
twelfth century. An age of learning and poetry gave way to an era of
ruth- less war, in which Christian as well as pagan soldiers pillaged
and fired mon- asteries, destroyed ancient manuscripts, and scattered
the art of centuries. “Neither bard nor philosopher nor musician,” says
an old Irish historian, “pursued his wonted profession in the land.”
44</p>
<p>At last a man appeared strong enough to unite the kingdoms into an
Irish nation. Brian Borumha or Boru (941-1014) was brother to King Mahon
of Munster, and headed the Dalgas clan. The brothers fought a Danish
army near Tipperary (968) and destroyed them, giving no quarter; then
they cap- tured Limerick, and despatched every Northman they could find.
But two kinglets — Molloy of Desmond and Donovan of Hy Carbery — fearing
that the marching brothers would absorb their realms, entered into a
league with the immigrant Danes, kidnaped Mahon, and slew him (976).
Brian, now king, again defeated the Danes, and killed Molloy. Resolved
to unify all Ire- land, and rejecting no means to this end, Brian allied
himself with the Danes of Dublin, overthrew with their aid the king of
Meath, and was acknowl- edged monarch of all Ireland (1013). Enjoying
peace after forty years of war, he rebuilt churches and monasteries,
repaired bridges and roads, founded schools and colleges, established
order and repressed crime; an imag- inative posterity illustrated the
security of this “King’s peace” by the story</p>

<p>For a time the harassed country recovered the luxuries of peace. In
the eleventh century art and literature revived; the Book of Leinster
and the Book of Hymns almost equaled the Book of Kells in splendor of
illumina- tion; historians and scholars flourished in the monastic
schools. But the Irish spirit had not yet been tamed. The nation again
divided into hostile king- doms, and spent its strength in civil war. In
1172 a handful of adventurers from Wales and England found it a simple
matter to conquer — another mat- ter to rule — the “Island of Doctors
and Saints.”</p>

<li>SCOTLAND: 325-1066</li>
</ol>
<p>Late in the fifth century a tribe of Gaelic Scotti from the north of
Ireland migrated to southwestern Scotland, and gave their name first to
a part, then to all, of the picturesque peninsula north of the Tweed.
Three other peoples contested the possession of this ancient
“Caledonia”: the Piets, a Ce ltic tribe, established above the Firth of
Forth; the Britons, refugees from the Anglo- Saxon invasion of Britain,
settled between the River Derwent and the Firth of Clyde; and the Angles
or English between the River Tyne and the Firth of Forth. From all these
the Scottish nation was formed: English in speech, Christian in
religion, as fiery as the Irish, as practical as the English, as subtle
and imaginative as any Celt.</p>
<p>Like the Irish, the Scotch were loath to relinquish their kinship
organiza- tion, to replace the clan by the state. The intensity of their
class conflicts was rivaled only by their proud loyalty to their clan,
and their tenacious resist- ance to foreign foes. Rome failed to conquer
them; on the contrary, neither Hadrian’s Wall b etween the Solway and
the Tyne (a.d. 120), nor that of Antoninus Pius, sixty miles farther
north between the firths of Forth and Clyde (140), nor the campaigns of
Septimius Severus (208) or Theodosius (368) availed to end the
periodical invasion of Britain by the hungry Piets. In 617 the Saxons
under Edwin, King of Northumbria, captured the hill stronghold of the
Piets, and named it Ed(w)inburgh. In 844 Kenneth Mac- Alpin united the
Piets and Scots under his crown; in 954 the tribes recap- tured
Edinburgh, and made it their capital; in 1018 Malcolm II conquered
Lothian (the region north of the Tweed), and merged it with the realm of
the Piets and Scots. Celtic supremacy seemed assured; but the Danish
inva- sions of England drove thousands of “English” into south Scotland,
and poured a strong Anglo-Saxon element into the Scottish blood.</p>
<p>Duncan I (1034-40) gathered all four peoples — Piets, Scots, Celtic
Brit- ish, and Anglo-Saxons — into one kingdom of Scotland. Duncan’s
defeat by the English at Durham gave an opening to his general Macbeth,
who claimed the throne because his wife Gruoch was granddaughter of
Kenneth III. Mac- beth murdered Duncan (1040), reigned for seventeen
years, and was mur-</p>

Scotland from 844 to 1057, twelve died by assassination. It was a
violent age of bitter struggle for food and water, freedom and power. In
those dour years Scot- land had little time for the frills and graces of
civilization; three centuries were to pass before Scottish literature
would begin. Norse raiders captured the Orkney Islands, the Faroes, the
Shetlands, and the Hebrides; and Scot- land lived ever under the threat
of conquest by those fearless Vikings who were spreading their power and
seed over the Western world.</p>
<p>V. THE NORTHMEN: 800-1066</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Kings’ Saga</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently the Northmen were Teutons whose ancestors had moved up
through Denmark and across the Skaggerak and Kattegat into Sweden and
Norway, displacing a Celtic population that had displaced a Mongolian
peo- ple akin to the Laplanders and Eskimos. 45 An early chieftain, Dan
Mikillati, gave his name to Denmark — Dan’s march or province; the
ancient tribe of Suiones, described by Tacitus as dominating the great
peninsula, left their name in Sweden (Sverige), and in many kings called
Sweyn; Norway (Norge) was simply the northern way. Skane, the name given
to Sweden by the elder Pliny, became in Latin Scandia , and begot the
Scandinavia that now covers three nations of kindred blood and mutually
intelligible speech. In all three countries the fertility of women, or
the imagination of men, outran the fertility of the soil; the young or
discontent took to their boats and prowled about the coasts for food,
slaves, wives, or gold; and their hunger acknowledged no laws and no
frontiers. The Norwegians overflowed into Scotland, Ireland, Iceland,
and Greenland; the Swedes into Russia; the Danes into England and
France.</p>
<p>Li fe’s brevity forbids the enumeration of gods or kings. Gorm (860
-935) gave Denmark unity; his son Harald Bluetooth (945-85) gave it
Christian- ity; Sweyn Forkbeard (985-1014) conquered England, and made
Denmark for a generation one of the great powers of Europe. King Olaf
Skottkonung (994-1022) made Sweden Christian, and Uppsala his capital.
In 800 Nor- way was a conglomeration of thirty-one principalities,
separated by moun- tains, rivers, or fjords, and each ruled by a warrior
chief. About 850 one such leader, Half dan the Black, from his capital
at Trondheim, subdued most of the others, and became Norway’s first
king. His son Harald Haarfager (860 -</p>

<p>name — the Fair-haired. 48 One of his many sons, Haakon the Good
(935-61), ruled Norway well for twenty- seven years; “peace lasted so
long,” com - plained a Viking warrior, “that I was afraid I might come
to die of old age, within doors on a bed.” 47 Another Haakon— “the Great
Earl”— governed Norway ably for thirty years (965-95); but in his old
age he offended the “bonders,” or free peasants, by taking their
daughters as concubines, and sending them home after a week or two. The
bonders called in Olaf Tryggvesson, and made him king.</p>
<p>Olaf, son of Tryggve, was a great grandson of Harald of the Fair
Hair. He was “a very merry frolicsome man,” said Snorri of Iceland, “gay
and social, very generous, and finical in his dress… stout and strong,
the handsomest of men, excelling in bodily exercises every Northman that
ever was heard of.” 48 He could run across the oars outside his ship
while men were rowing; could juggle three sharp- pointed daggers, could
cast two spears at once, and “could cut equally well w ith either hand.”
49 Many a quarrel he had, and many an adventure. While in the British
Isles he was converted to Christianity, and became its merciless
advocate. When he was made King of Norway (995) he destroyed pagan
temples, built Christian churches, and continued to live in polygamy.
The bonders opposed the new religion fiercely, and demanded that Olaf
should make sacrifice to Thor as in the ancient ritual; he agreed, but
proposed to offer Thor the most acceptable sacrifice — the leading bond-
ers themselves; whereupon they became Christians. When one of them,
Rand, persisted in paganism, Olaf had him bound, and forced a serpent
down his throat by burning the serpent’s tail; the viper made its way
through Rand’s stomach and side, and Rand died. 50 Olaf proposed
marriage to Sigrid, Queen of Sweden; she accepted, but refused to
abandon her pagan faith; Olaf struck her in the face with his glove,
saying, “Why should I care to have thee, an old faded woman, a heathen
jade?” “This may some day be thy death,” said Sigrid. Two years later
the kings of Sweden and Denmark, and Earl Eric of Norway, made war
against Olaf; he was defeated in a great naval battle near Riigen; he
leaped full-armed into the sea, and never rose again ( 1000). Norway was
divided among the victors.</p>
<p>Another Olaf, called the Saint, reunited Norway (1016), restored
order, gave righteous judgment, and completed the conversion of the land
to Chris- tianity. “He was a good and very gentle man,” says Snorri, “of
little speech, and openhanded, but greedy of money,” and slightly
addicted to concu - bines. 51 One bonder who preferred paganism had his
tongue cut out, another his eyes. 52 The bonders conspired with King
Cnut of Denmark and England, who came with fifty ships and drove Olaf
from Norway (1028); Olaf re- turned with an army and fought for his
throne at Stiklestad; he was defeated, and died of his wounds (1030) ;
on the site posterity dedicated a cathedral to him as Norway’s patron
saint. His son Magnus the Good (10 35-47) recap- tured the kingdom, and
gave it good laws and government; his grandson</p>

<p>XXHarald the Stern (1047-66) ruled Norway with merciless justice
until the year when William of Normandy took England.</p>
<p>About 860 a band of Northmen from Norway or Denmark rediscovered
Iceland, and were not quite displeased to find it so similar to their
own land in mists and fjords. Norwegians fretting under the new
absolutism of Harald Haarfager migrated to the island in 874; and by 934
it was as thickly settled as it would ever be before the Second World
War. Each of the four provinces had its thing, or assembly; in 930 an
allthing, or united parliament, was estab- lished — one of the earliest
institutions in the history of representative govern- ment, making
Iceland then the only fully free republic in the world. But the same
vigor and independence of spirit that motivated the migration and molded
this parliament limited the effectiveness of the common government and
laws; powerful individuals, rooted on their great estates, became the
law of their lands, and soon revived in Iceland the feuds that had made
Norway so difficult for her kings. In the year 1 000 the allthing
formally adopted Chris- tianity; but King Olaf the Saint was scandalized
to hear that the Icelanders continued to eat horseflesh and practice
infanticide. Perhaps because the winter nights were long and cold, a
literature of myths and sagas grew up that apparently excelled in
quantity and quality the like tales told in the home- lands of the
Norse.</p>
<p>Sixteen years after the rediscovery of Iceland, a Norwegian
skipper,</p>
<p>Gunnbjorn Ulfsson, sighted Greenland. About 985 Thorwald and his son
Eric the Red established a Norwegian colony there. In 986 Bjeme
Herjulfs- son discovered Labrador; and in the year 1000 Leif, son of
Eric the Red, landed on the American continent; we do not know whether
it was Labrador or Newfoundland or Cape Cod. Leif Ericsson wintered in
“Vinland” (wine land), and then returned to Greenland. In 1002 his
brother Thorwald, with thirty men, spent a year in Vinland. An
interpolation, not later than 1 395, in the “Saga of Olaf Tryggvesson,”
by Snorri Sturluson (1179 -1241), tells of five separate expeditions by
Norsemen to continental America between 985 and 10 1 1. In 1477
Christopher Columbus, by his own account, sailed to Ice- land, and
studied its traditions of the new world. 53</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Viking Civilization *</li>
</ol>
<p>Social order among the Norse, as elsewhere, was based upon family
dis- cipline, economic co- operation, and religious belief. “In him who
well considers,” says a passa ge in Beowulf, “nothing can stifle
kinship.” 54 Un -</p>

Scandinavian peoples in the “Viking Age”— a.d. 700-1 100.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 505</p>
<p>wanted children were exposed to die; but once accepted, the child
received a judicious compound of discipline and love. There were no
family names; each son merely added his father’s name to his own: Olaf
Haraldsson, Mag - nus Olafsson, Haakon Magnusson. Long before
Christianity came to them, the Scandinavians, in naming a child, poured
water over him as a symbol of admission into the family.</p>
<p>Education was practical: girls learned the arts of the home,
including the brewing of ale; boys learned to swim, ski, work wood and
metal, wrestle, row, skate, play hockey (from Danish hoek, hook) , hunt,
and fight with bow and arrow, sword or spear. Jumping was a favorite
exercise. Some Nor- wegians, fully armed and armored, could jump above
their own height, or swim for miles; some could run faster than the
fleetest horse. 55 Many children learned to read and write; some were
trained in medicine or law. Both sexes sang lustily; a few in either sex
played musical instruments, usually the harp; we read in the Elder Edda
how King Gunnar could play the harp with his toes, and charm snakes with
its tones.</p>
<p>Polygamy was practiced by the rich till the thirteenth century.
Marriages were arranged by the parents, often through purchase; the free
woman could veto such an arrangement , 56 but if she married against the
will of her parents her husband was declared an outlaw, and might
legally be slain by her rela- tives. A man could divorce his wife at
will; but unless he gave good reason he too was subject to assassination
by her family. Either mate might divorce the other for dressing like the
opposite sex — as when the wife wore breeches, or the man wore a shirt
open at the breast. A husband might kill with impunity — i.e., without
provoking a blood feud — any man whom he caught in illicit relations
with his wife. 57 Women worked hard, but they remained sufficiently
delectable to stir men on to kill one another for their sakes; and men
dominant in public life were, as everywhere, recessive at home. In
general the position of woman was higher in pagan than in later
Christian Scandinavia ; 58 she was the mother not of sin but of strong
brave men; she had one-third — after twenty years of marriage one-half —
right in all wealth acquired by her hus- band; she was consulted by him
in his business arrangements, and mingled freely with men in her
home.</p>
<p>Work was held in honor, and all classes shared in it. Fishing was a
major industry, and hunting was a necessity rather than a sport. Picture
the power of will and toil that cleared the forests of Sweden, and tamed
to tillage the frozen slopes of Norway’s hills; the wheat fields of
Minnesota are the off - spring of American soil crossed with Norwegian
character. Large estates were few; Scandinavia has excelled in the wide
distribution of land among a free peasantry. An unwritten insurance
softened disaster: if a farmer’s house burned down, his neighbors joined
him in rebuilding it; if his cattle were de- stroyed by disease or an
“act of God,” th ey contributed to his flocks a number of animals equal
to half his loss. Nearly every Northman was a craftsman,</p>
<p>506 the age of faith (chap. </p>
<p>XXespecially skilled in wood. The Norse were backward in using iron,
which came to them only in the eighth century; but then they made a
variety of strong and handsome tools, weapons, and ornaments of bronze,
silver, and gold; 59 shields, damascened swords, rings, pins, harness
were often objects of beauty and pride. Norse shipwrights built boats
and warships not larger, but apparently sturdier, than those of
antiquity; flat-bottomed for steadiness, sharp in the bow to ram the
enemy; four to six feet deep, sixty to one hundred and eighty feet long;
propelled partly by a sail, mostly by oars — ten, sixteen or sixty to a
side; these simple vessels carried Norse explorers, traders, pirates,
and warriors down the rivers of Russia to the Caspian and Black Seas,
and over the Atlantic to Iceland and Labrador.</p>
<p>The Vikings divided themselves into jarls or earls, bondi or peasant
pro- prietors, and thralls or slaves; and (like the guardians in Plato’s
Republic ) they sternly taught their children that each man’s class was
a decree of the gods, which only the faithless would dare to change. 00
Kings were chosen from royal blood, the provincial governors from the
jarls. Along with this frank acceptance of monarchy and aristocracy as
natural concomitants of war and agriculture, went a remarkable democracy
by which the landowners acted as legislators and judges in a local
hus-thing or meeting of householders, a village mot, a provincial thing
or assembly, and a national allthing or par- liament. It was a
government of laws and not merely of men; violence was the exception,
judgment the rule. Feud revenge incarnadined the sagas, but even in that
Viking Age of blood and iron the wergild was replacing private
vengeance, and only the sea-rovers were men with no law but victory or
defeat. Harsh punishments were used to persuade to order and peace men
hardened by the struggle with nature; adulterers were hanged, or trodden
to death by horses; incendiaries were burned at the stake; parricides
were sus- pended by the heels next to a live wolf similarly hung; rebels
against the government were torn asunder by horses driven apart, or were
dragged to death behind a wild bull; 61 perhaps in these barbarities the
law had not yet replaced, but only socialized, revenge. Even piracy at
last gave way to law; the robbers subsided into traders, and substituted
wits for force. Much of the sea law of Europe is Norse in origin,
transmitted through the Hanseatic League. 62 Under Magnus the Good
(1035-47) th e l aws °f Norway were inscribed on a parchment called from
its color the “Grey Goose”; this still survives, and reveals enlightened
edicts for the control of weights and meas- uses, the policing of
markets and ports, the state succor of the sick and the poor. 63</p>
<p>Religion helped law and the family to turn the animal into a citizen.
The gods of the Teutonic pantheon were not mythology to the Norse, but
actual divinities feared or loved, and intimately connected with mankind
by a thou- sand miracles and amours. In the wonder and terror of
primitive souls all the forces and major embodiments of nature had
become personal deities; and</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 507</p>
<p>he more powerful of these required a sedulous propitiation that did
not stop short of human sacrifice. It was a crowded Valhalla: twelve
gods and twelve goddesses; divers giants (Jotuns), fates (Norns), and
Valkyries — messengers and ale-bearers of the gods; and a sprinkling of
witches, elves, and trolls. The gods were magnified mortals, subject to
birth, hunger, sleep, sickness, passion, sorrow, death; they excelled
men only in size, longevity, and power. Odin (German Woden), the father
of all the gods, had lived near the Sea of Azov in Caesar’s time; there
he had built Asgard, or the Garden of the Gods, for his family and his
counselors. Suffering from land hunger, he conquered north Europe. He
was not unchallenged nor omnipotent; Loki scolded him like a fishwife ,
64 and Thor quite ignored him. He wandered over the earth seeking
wisdom, and bartered an eye for a drink at wisdom’s well; then he in -
vented letters, taught his people writing, poetry, and the arts, and
gave them laws. Anticipating the end of his earthly life, he called an
assembly of Swedes and Goths, wounded himself in nine places, died, and
returned to Asgard to live as a god.</p>
<p>In Iceland Thor was greater than Odin. He was the god of thunder,
war, labor, and law; the black clouds were his frowning brows, the
thunder was his voice, the lightning was his hammer flung from the
skies. The Norse poets, perhaps already as skeptical as Homer, had much
fun with him, like the Greeks with Hephaestus or Heracles; they
represented him in all sorts of predicaments and toils; nevertheless he
was so loved that nearly every fifth Icelander usurped his name —
Thorolf, Thorwald, Thorstein</p>
<p>Great in legend, minor in worship, was Odi n’s son Baldur, “dazzling
in form and feature… mildest, wisest, and most eloquent” of the gods ;
65 the early missionaries were tempted to identify him with Christ. He
had a terrible dream of his impending death, and told the gods of it;
the goddess Frigga exacted an oath from all minerals, animals, and
plants that none would injure him; his glorious body thereafter repelled
all hurtful objects, so that the gods amused themselves by hurling at
him stones and darts, axes and swords; all weapons were turned away, and
left him scatheless. But Frigga had neglected to pry an oath of
innocuousness from “a little shrub called mistletoe,” as being too
feeble to hurt any man; Loki, the irreverent mischief-maker among the
gods, cut off a twig of it, and persuaded a blind deity to throw it at
Baldur; pierced with it, Baldur expired. His wife Nep died of a broken
heart, and was burned on the same pyre with Baldur and his gorgeously
caparisoned horse. 66</p>
<p>The Valkyries — “Choosers of the Slain”— were empowered to decree the
death date of each soul. Those men who died basely were thrust down into
the realms of Hel, the goddess of the dead; those who died in battle
were led by the Valkyries to Valhalla — “Hall of the Chosen”; there, as
favorite sons of Odin, they were reincarnated in strength and beauty to
spend their days in manly battle and their nights in drinking ale. But
(says late Norse mythol- ogy) the time came when the Jotuns — monstrous
demons of disorder and</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXdestruction — declared war upon the gods, and fought with them to
mutual extinction. In this Twilight of the Gods all the universe fell to
ruin: not merely sun and planets and stars, but, at the last, Valhalla
itself, and all its warriors and deities; only Hope survived — that in
the movement of slow time a new earth would form, a new heaven, a better
justice, and a hi gher god than Odin or Thor. Perhaps that mighty fable
symbolized the victory of Christianity, and the hardy blows that two
Olafs struck for Christ. Or had the Viking poets come to doubt — and
bury — their gods?</p>
<p>It was a marvelous mythology, second only to the Greek in
fascination. The oldest form in which it has come down to us is in those
strange poems to which error has given the name of Edda* In 1643 a
bishop discovered in the Royal Library of Copenhagen a manuscript
containing some old Icelandic poems; by a double mistake he called them
the Edda of Saemund the Wise (c. 1056-1133), an Icelandic
scholar-priest. It is now generally agreed that the poems were composed
in Norway, Iceland, and Greenland by unknown authors at unknown dates
between the eighth and twelfth centuries, that Saemund may have
collected, but did not write, them, and that Edda was not their name.
But time sanctions error as well as theft, and compromises by calling
the poems the Poetic or Elder Edda. Most of them are narrative bal- lads
of the old Scandinavian or Germanic heroes or gods. Here for the first
time we meet with Sigurd the Volsung and other heroes, heroines, and
villains destined to take more definite form in the V olsungasaga and
the Nibelungen- lied. The most powerful of the Edda poems is the
Voluspa, wherein the prophetess Volva describes with somber and majestic
imagery the creation of the world, its coming destruction, and its
ultimate regeneration. In quite different style is “The High One’s Lay,”
in which Odin, after meeting all sorts of conditions and men, formulates
his maxims of wisdom, not always like a god:</p>
<p>Much too early I came to many places, or too late; the beer was</p>
<p>not yet ready, or was already drunk. 07… The best drunkenness is</p>
<p>when everyone after it regains his reason. 68… In a maiden’s words
none should place faith, nor in a woman’s; for guile has bee n laid in
their breasts; 69… this I experienced when I strove to seduce that</p>
<p>discreet maiden;… nor of that damsel gained I aught. 70… At eve</p>
<p>he day is to be praised, a sword after it is tested, a woman after
she is cremated. 71… Of the words that a man speaks to another he often
pays the penalty 72… the tongue is the bane of the head. 73 Even in
three words quarrel not with a worse man; often the better man</p>
<p>yields, when the worse strikes. 74… He should rise early who covets
another’s property or wife. 73… Moderately wise should a man be,</p>
<ul>
<li>The word first occurs in a tenth-century fragment, where it means a
great-grandmother; by some prank of time it came to mean the technical
laws of Norwegian prosody, and was so used by Snorri Sturluson when
(1222) he wrote under that tide a treatise on Norse mythology and the
poetic art; this we know as the Prose or Younger Edda.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE RISE OF THE NORTH 509</p>
<p>not over-wise…. Let no man know his destiny beforehand; thus</p>
<p>will his mind be most free from care A wise man’s heart is seldom</p>
<p>glad. 76… One’s home is best, small though it be 77… best is one’s
hearth, and the sight of the sun. 78</p>
<p>Probably the poems of the Elder Edda were preserved by word of mouth
until the twelfth century, when they were put into writing. In the
Viking Age letters were runes, as in north Germany and Anglo-Saxon
England; these twenty- four symbols (literally, “mysteries”) constituted
an alphabet roughly formed on Greek and Latin cursive scripts.
Literature, however, could in that age dispense with letters; minstrel
skalds composed, memorized, recited, and orally transmitted their lays
of the Teutonic gods, and of that “Heroic Age” (from the fourth to the
sixth century) when the Germanic peoples spread their power over Europe.
Sturluson and others preserved some fragments of the lays, and the names
of many skalds. The most famous of these was Sigvat Thordarsson, who
served St. Olaf as court poet and candid counselor. Another, Egil
Skallagrimsson (900-83), was the leading figure of his time in Iceland —
a mighty warrior, an individualistic baron, a passionate poet. In his
old age he lost his youngest son by drowning, and was about to kill
himself with grief when his daughter persuaded him to write a poem
instead. His Sonartorrek (“The Loss of the Son”) is a defiant denun -
ciation of the god, whom he blames for the death; he regrets that he
cannot find Odin and fight him as he has fought other enemies. Then a
softer mood comes, as he reflects that the gods have given him not only
sorrow but the gift of poesy; reconciled, he resolves to live, and
resumes his high seat in the councils of his country. 79</p>
<p>The literature of Scandinavia in this period doubtless exaggerates
the vio- lence of Viking society, as journalism and history, luring the
reader with the exceptional, miss the normal flow of human life.
Nevertheless the hard condi- tions of early Scandinavia compelled a
struggle for existence in which only men of the toughest fiber could
survive; and a Nietzschean ethic of unscrupu- lous courage rose out of
ancient customs of feud and revenge and the lawless piracy of ungoverned
seas. “Tell me what faith you are of,” one Viking asked of another. “I
believe in my own strength,” was the reply. 80 Gold Harald wanted the
throne of Norway, and proposed to get it by force. His friend Haakon
advised him: “Consider with thyself what thou art man enough to
undertake; for to accomplish such a purpose requires a man bold and
firm, who will stick at neither good nor evil to accomplish what is
intended.” 81 Some of these men found such pleasure in battle as almost
anesthetized their wounds; some went into a battle frenzy known as
berser ksgangr — “the ber - serk’s way” ; the berserkers — “bear -
shirters”— were champions who rushed into combat without shirts of mail,
and fought and howled like animals, bit their shields in fury, and then,
the battle over, fell into a coma of exhaustion. 82</p>
<p>510 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXOnly the brave would enter Valhalla; and all sins would be forgiven
to him who died for his group in war.</p>
<p>So trained in hardship and wild games, the “men of the fjords” rowed
out and conquered kingdoms for themselves in Russia, Pomerania, Frisia,
Nor- mandy, England, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, Italy, and Sicily.
These ven- tures were not invasions by masses of soldiery like the
Moslem hijad or the Magyar flood; they were the reckless sallies of mere
handfuls of men, who thought all weakness criminal and all strength
good, who hungered for land, women, wealth, and power, and felt a divine
right to share in the fruits of the earth. They began like pirates and
ended like statesmen; Rollo gave a creative order to Normandy, William
the Conqueror to England, Roger II to Sicily; they mingled their fresh
blood of the north, like an energizing hormone, with that of peoples
made torpid by rural routine. History seldom destroys that which does
not deserve to die; and the burning of the tares makes for the next
sowing a richer soil.</p>

<p>The Norse irruptions were the final phase of those barbarian
invasions that had stemmed from Germany five centuries before, and had
shattered the Roman Empire into the nations of Western Europe. What had
become of the Germans who had remained in Germany?</p>
<p>The exodus of great tribes — Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Franks,
Lom- bards — left Germany underpopulated for a time; the Slavic Wends
moved westward from the Baltic states to fill the vacuum; and by the
sixth century the Elbe was the ethnic, as it is at present the
political, frontier between the Slavic and the Western world. West of
the Elbe and the Saale were the sur- viving German tribes: Saxons in
north central Germany, East Franks along the lower Rhine, Thuringians
between them, Bavarians (once Marcomanni) along the middle Danube, and
Swabians (once Suevi) along and between the upper Rhine and upper
Danube, and along the eastern Jura and the northern Alps. There was no
Germany, only German tribes. Charlemagne for a time gave them the unity
of conquest, and the essentials of a common order; but the collapse of
the Carolingian Empire loosened these bonds; and until Bis- marck tribal
consciousness and local particularism fought every centralizing
influence, and weakened a people uncomfortably shut in by enemies, the
Alps, and the sea.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Verdun (843) had in effect made Louis or Ludwig the</p>
<p>German, grandson of Charlemagne, the first king of Germany. The
Treaty of Mersen (870) gave him additional territory, and defined
Germany as the</p>
<p>CHAP. XX) THE RISE OF T HE NORTH 511</p>
<p>land between the Rhine and the Elbe, plus part of Lorraine, and the
bishoprics of Mainz, Worms, and Speyer. Louis was a statesman of the
first order, but he had three sons; and on his death (876) his realm was
divided among them. After a decade of chaos, during which the Northmen
raided the Rhine cities, Amulf, illegitimate offspring of Louis’ son
Carloman, was elected king of “East Francia” (887), and drove back the
invaders. But his successor, Louis “the Child” (899 -91 1), proved too
young and weak to hold back the Mag- yars, who ravaged Bavaria (900) ,
Carinthia (901), Saxony (906) , Thuringia (908) , and Alemannia (909).
The central government failed to protect these provinces; each had to
provide its own defense; the provincial dukes organ- ized armies by
giving lands in fief to retainers who paid in military service. The
forces so raised gave the dukes virtual independence of the crown, and
established a feudal Germany. On the death of Louis the nobles and
prelates, successfully claiming the right of choosing the king, gave the
throne to Con- rad I, Duke of Franconia (91 1- 18). Conrad spent himself
in strife with Duke Henry of Saxony, but had the wit to recommend Henry
as his successor. Henry I, called “the Fowler” because of his love of
hunting, drove back the Slavic Wends to the Oder, fortified Germany
against the Magyars, defeated them in 933, and prepared, by his patient
labors, for the achievements of his son.</p>
<p>Otto I the Great (936-73) was the Charlemagne of Germany. He was
twenty-four at his accession, but was already a king in bearing and
ability. Sensing the value of ceremony and symbolism, he persuaded the
dukes of Lorraine, Franconia, Swabia, and Bavaria to act as his
attendants in his solemn coronation at Aachen by Archbishop Hildebert.
Later the dukes rebelled against his growing power, and induced his
younger brother Henry to join in a plot to depose-him; Otto discovered
and suppressed the conspiracy, and forgave Henry, who conspired again
and was again forgiven. The subtle King gave new duchies to his friends
and relatives, and gradually subordi- nated the dukes; later monarchs
would not inherit his resolution and skill, and much of medieval Germany
was consumed in conflicts between feudalism and royalty. In this contest
the German prelates sided with the King, and became his administrative
aides and counselors, sometimes his generals. The King appointed bishops
and archbishops as he named other officials of the government; and the
German Church became a national institution, only loosely attached to
the papacy. Using Christianity as a unifying force, Otto fused the
German tribes into a powerful state.</p>
<p>On the urging of his bishops, Otto attacked the Wends, and sought to
con- vert them to Christianity by the sword. He compelled the king of
Denmark and the dukes of Poland and Bohemia to accept him as their
feudal suzerain. Aspiring to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, he
welcomed the invita- tion of Adelaide, the pretty widow of King Lothaire
of Italy, to rescue her from the indignities to which she had been
subjected by the new King Beren-</p>
<p>512 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXgar II. Otto combined politics deftly with romance: he invaded
Italy, married Adelaide, and allowed Berengar to retain his kingdom only
as a fief of the German crown (951). The Roman aristocracy refused to
acknowledge a German as emperor and therefore as master of Italy; now
began a contest that would last for three centuries. The rebellion of
his son Ludolf and his son-in-law Conrad called Otto back to Germany,
lest in trying to become emperor he should cease to be king. When the
Magyars again invaded Ger- many (954), Ludolf and Conrad welcomed them,
and supplied them with guides. Otto put down the rebellion, forgave
Ludolf, reorganized his army, and so decisively defeated the Magyars at
the Lechfeld, near Augsburg (955), that Germany won a long period of
security and peace. Otto now devoted himself to internal affairs —
restored order, suppressed crime, and for a time created a united
Germany, the most prosperous state of its time.</p>
<p>Imperial opportunity returned when Pope John XII appealed for his aid
against Berengar (959). Otto invaded Italy with a strong force, entered
Rome peaceably, and was crowned Roman Emperor of the West by John XII in
962. The Pope, regretting this action, complained that Otto had not
fulfilled a promise to restore the Ravenna exarchate to the papacy. Otto
took the extreme step of marching into Rome, summoning a synod of
Italian bish- ops, and persuading it to depose John and make a layman
Pope as Leo VIII (963). The papal territory was now confined to the
duchy of Rome and the Sabine region; the rest of central and northern
Italy was absorbed into a Holy Roman Empire that became an appanage of
the German crown. From these events German kings would conclude that
Italy was part of their inheritance; and the popes would conclude that
no man could become Roman emperor of the West except by papal
coronation.</p>
<p>Otto, nearing death, forestalled disorder by having his son Otto II
crowned coemperor by Pope John XIII (967); and he secured as his son’s
wife The- ophano, daughter of Romanus II the Byzantine Emperor (972);
Charle- magne’s dream of a marital union of the two empires was
transiently made real. Then, old in deeds but still only sixty years of
age, Otto passed away (973), and all Germany mourned him as its greatest
king. Otto II (973-83) spent himself in efforts to add southern Italy to
his realm, and died prema- turely in the attempt. Otto III (983-1002)
was then a boy of three; his mother Theophano and his grandmother
Adelaide ruled as regents for eight years. Theophano, in her eighteen
years of influence, brought something of Byzantine refinement to the
German court, and stimulated the Ottonian renaissance in letters and
arts.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen (996) Otto III began to rule in his own name.
Influ- enced by Gerbert and other churchmen, he proposed to make Rome
his capital, and unite all Christendom under a restored Roman Empire,
ruled jointly by emperor and pope. The nobles and populace of Rome and
Lom- bardy interpreted the plan as a conspiracy to establish a
German-Byzantine</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>CHAP. XX)</p>
<p>513</p>
<p>rule over Italy; they resisted Otto, and established a “Roman
Republic”; Otto suppressed it, and executed its leader Crescentius. In
999 he made Ger- bert Pope; but the twenty- two years of Otto’s life,
and the four years of Gerbert’s papacy, proved too brief for the
implementation of his policy. Half a saint but in some measure a man,
Otto fell in love with Stephania, widow of Crescentius; she consented to
be his mistress and poisoner; the young king, feeling death in his
veins, became a weeping penitent, and died at Viterbo at the age of
twenty-two. 83</p>
<p>Henry II (1002-24), last of the Saxon line of German kings, labored
to restore the power of the monarch in Italy and Germany, where the
reigns of two boys had strengthened the dukes and emboldened neighboring
states. Conrad II (1024-39), beginning the Franconian or Salian line of
emperors, pacified Italy, and added to Germany the kingdom of Burgundy
or Arles. Needing funds, he sold bishoprics for sums so large that his
conscience irked him; he swore never again to take money for an
ecclesiastical appointment, and “almost succeeded in keeping his oath.”
84 His son Henry III (1039 -56) brought the new empire to its zenith. On
the “Day of Indulgence,” at Con - stance in 1043, he offered pardon to
all those who had injured him, and exhorted his subjects to renounce all
vengeance and hatred. For a decade his preaching and example — perhaps
also his power — reduced the feuds of the dukes, and co- operated with
the contemporary “Truce of God” to bring a brief golden age to Central
Europe. He patronized learning, founded schools, and completed the
cathedrals of Speyer, Mainz, and Worms. But he was no saint pledged to
eternal peace. He warred, with Hungary till it recognized him as its
feudal suzerain. He deposed three rival claimants to the papacy, and
appointed two successive popes. In all Europe no other power equaled
his. In the end he pushed his authority to an extreme that aroused
opposition among both the prelates and the dukes, but he died before the
storm, and bequeathed to Henry IV a hostile papacy and a troubled
realm.</p>
<p>Henry was four when crowned king at Aachen, six at his father’s
death. His mother and two archbishops served as regents till 1065; then
the fifteen- year-old boy was declared of age, and found himself vested
with an imperial power that must have turned any youthful head. He came
naturally to be- lieve in absolute monarchy, and sought to rule
accordingly; soon he was at odds or war with one or another of the great
nobles who had in his helpless- ness almost dismembered his realm. The
Saxons resented the taxes laid upon them, and refused to restore the
crown lands that he claimed; for fifteen years (1072-88) he fought an
intermittent war with them; when he defeated them in 1075 he compelled
their whole force, including its proudest nobles and its martial
bishops, to walk disarmed and barefoot between the files of his army,
and lay their act of surrender at his feet. In that same year Pope
Gregory VII issued a decree against lay investiture — the appointment of
bishops or abbots by laymen. Henry, standing on the precedents of a
century, never doubted</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>5*4</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXhis right to make such appointments; he fought Gregory for ten
years in diplomacy and war, and literally to the death, in one of the
bitterest conflicts in medieval history. The rebellious nobles of
Germany took advantage of the quarrel to strengthen their feudal power,
and the humiliated Saxons renewed their revolt. Henry’s sons joined the
opposition; and in 1098 the Diet of Mainz declared Henry V king. The son
took the father prisoner, and compelled him to abdicate (1105); the
father escaped, and was forming a new army when he died at Liege, in the
fifty-seventh year of his age ( 1 106). Pope Paschal II could not grant
Christian burial to an unrepentant excommunicate; but the people of
Liege, defying Pope and King, gave Henry IV a royal funeral, and buried
him in their cathedral.</p>

<li>German Civilization: 566-1106</li>
</ol>
<p>Through these five centuries the labor of men and women tilling the
soil and rearing children conquered Germany for civilization. The
forests were fearfully immense, harbored wild animals, impeded
communication and unity; nameless heroes of the woodland felled the
trees — perhaps too reck- lessly. In Saxony the struggle against the
self-regenerating forest and the infectious marsh went on for a thousand
years, and only the thirteenth cen- tury gave man the victory.
Generation after generation the hardy, hearty peasants pushed back the
beasts and the wilderness, tamed the land with mattock and plow, planted
fruit trees, herded flocks, tended vines, and con- soled their
loneliness with love and prayer, flowers and music and beer. Miners dug
salt, iron, copper, lead, and silver from the earth; manorial, monastic,
and domestic handicraft wedded Roman to German skills; trade flowed ever
more busily over the rivers and into the North and Baltic Seas. At last
the great campaign was won; barbarism still lurked in the laws and the
blood; but the gap had been spanned between the tribal chaos of the
fifth century and the Ottoman renaissance of the tenth. From 955 to 1075
Ger- many was the most prosperous country in Europe, rivaled only by
that northern Italy which had received law and order from German kings.
Old Roman towns like Trier, Mainz, and Cologne carried on; new cities
grew around the episcopal seats at Speyer, Magdeburg, and Worms. About
1050 we begin to hear of Nuremberg.</p>
<p>The Church was the educator, as well as the administrator, of Germany
in this age. Monastic schools — really colleges — were opened at Fulda,
Tegernsee, Reichenau, Gandersheim, Hildesheim, and Lorsch. Rabanus
Maurus (776? —</p>
<p>856), after studying under Alcuin at Tours, became abbot of the great
monastery at Fulda in Prussia, and made its school famous throughout Eu-
rope as the mother of scholars and of twenty-two affiliated
institutions. He extended the curriculum to include many sciences, and
reproved the super-</p>
<p>THE RISE OF THE NORTH</p>
<p>CHAP. XX )</p>
<p>stitions that ascribed natural events to occult powers. 85 The
library at Fulda grew to be one of the largest in Europe; to it we owe
Suetonius, Tacitus, and Ammianus Marcellinus. An uncertain tradition
attributes to Rabanus the majestic hymn, Veni Creator Spiritus , which
is sung at the consecration of popes, bishops, or kings. 86 St. Bruno,
who was both the Duke of Lorraine and the Archbishop of Cologne, and
became imperial chancellor under Otto the Great, opened a school in the
royal palace to train an administrative class; he brought scholars and
books from Byzantium and Italy, and himself taught Greek and
philosophy.</p>
<p>The German language had as yet no literature; nearly all writing was
done by clerics, and in Latin. The greatest German poet of the age was
Walafrid Strabo (809-49), a Swabian monk at Reichenau. For a time he was
tutor to Charles the Bald in the palace of Louis the Pious at Aachen; he
found an enlightened patron in Louis’ wife, the beautiful and ambitious
Judith. Re - turning to Reichenau as its abbot, he gave himself to
religion, poetry, and gardening; and in a delightful poem De cultura
hortorum — On the Care of Gardens — he described one by oae the herbs
and flowers that he tended so fondly.</p>
<p>His greatest rival in the literature of Germany in these centuries
was a nun. Hroswitha was only one of many German women who in this age
were dis- tinguished for culture and refinement. Born about 935, she
entered the Bene- dictine convent at Gandersheim. The standard of
instruction must have been higher than we should have expected, for
Hroswitha became familiar with the poets of pagan Rome, and learned to
write Latin fluently. She composed some lives of saints in Latin
hexameters, and a minor epic about Otto the Great. But the works that
make her memorable are six Latin prose comedies in the manner of
Terence. Her purpose, she tells us, was “to make the small talent
vouchsafed her by Heaven give forth, under the hammer of devotion, a
faint sound to the praise of God.” 87 She mourns the pagan indecency of
Latin comedy, and proposes to offer a Christian substitute; but even her
plays turn on a profane love that hardly conceals a warm undercurrent of
physical desire. In the best of her brief dramas, Abraham , a Christian
anchorite leaves his hermitage to care for an orphaned niece. She elopes
with a seducer, is soon deserted, and becomes a prostitute. Abraham
traces her, disguises himself, and enters her chamber. When she kisses
him she recognizes him, and recoils in shame. In a tender and poetic
colloquy he persuades her to abandon her life of sin, and return to
their home. We do not know whether these dramatic sketches were ever
performed. The modern drama developed not out of such echoes of Terence,
but out of the ceremonies and “mysteries” of the Church, crossed with
the farces of wandering mimes.</p>
<p>As the Church gave a home to poetry, drama, and historiography, so
she provided subjects and funds for art. German monks, stirred by
Byzantine and Carolingian examples, and helped by the patronage of
German princesses,</p>

<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXproduced in this age a hundred illuminated manuscripts of high
excellence. Bernewald, Bishop of Hildesheim from 993 to 1022, was almost
a summary of the culture of his age: a painter, a calligrapher, a
metalworker, a mosaicist, an administrator, a saint. He made his city an
art center by assembling artists of diverse provenance and skills; with
their help, but also with his own hands, he fashioned jeweled crosses,
gold and silver candlesticks chased with animal and floral forms, and a
chalice set with antique gems, one of which repre- sented the three
Graces in their wonted nudity. 88 The famous bronze doors which his
artists made for his cathedral were the first historiated metal doors of
the Middle Ages to be solidly cast instead of being composed of flat
panels affixed to wood. Domestic architecture showed no signs yet of the
lovely forms that would grace German cities in the Renaissance; but
church archi- tecture now graduated from wood to stone, imported from
Lombardy Romanesque ideas of transept, choir, apse, and towers, and
began the cathe- drals of Hildesheim, Lorsch, Worms, Mainz, Trier,
Speyer, and Cologne. Foreign critics complained of flat timbered
ceilings and excessive external decoration in this “Rhenish Romanesque”;
but these churches well expressed the solid strength of the German
character, and the spirit of an age labori- ously struggling up to
civilization.</p>
