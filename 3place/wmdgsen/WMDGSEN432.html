<p>1608 — 74</p>
<p>I. JOHN BUNYAN: 1 62 8-88</p>
<p>I N THEIR enthusiasm for religion and morality, the Puritans felt
no</p>
<p>need of secular literature. The King James Bible was literature
enough; nearly everything else seemed trivial or sinful dross. A member
of Parlia- ment proposed in 1653 that nothing should be studied in the
universities except the Scriptures and “the work of Jakob Bohme, and
such like.” 1 This seems depressing, but we should note that at the
height of the Puritan ascendancy (1653) Sir Thomas Urquhart published
his spirited translation of Rabelais,* preferring scatology to
eschatology. And in the same year Izaak Walton cast his Compleat Angler
upon the waters. Even today, with judicious leaps from one fish to
another, that book is refreshing in its simple, fresh-air mood; and it
is a reminder that while England was passing through a revolution as
violent as 1789, men could go quietly to snare some eager creature in
rura l streams. “Turn out of the way a little, good Scholar, toward
yonder high honeysuckle hedge; there we’ll sit and sing whilst this
shower falls so gently upon the teeming earth.” 2</p>
<p>Andrew Marvell kept his head, every wise, during the shuffling of
govern- ments between his birth in 1621 and his death in 1678. He
welcomed Cromwell’s return from Ireland with a vigorous and melodious
ode, but in it he dared to write with sympathy of the dying Charles
I:</p>
<p>He nothing common did, or mean,</p>
<p>Upon that memorable scene,</p>
<p>But with his keener eye</p>
<p>The axe’s edge did try.</p>
<p>Nor called the gods with vulgar spite</p>
<p>To vindicate his helpless right,</p>
<p>But bowed his comely head</p>
<p>Down, as upon a bed. 8</p>
<p>Marvell became assistant to Milton as Latin secretary to Cromwell,
was elected to Parliament in 1659, helped to save Milton from the
vengeance</p>

translation in 1708.</li>
</ul>
<p>207</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>of the triumphant royalists, lived through eighteen years of the
Restoration, and condemned its immorality, corruption, and incompetence
in satires that he carefully refrained from publishing.</p>
<p>John Bunyan’s classics, like Milton’s epics, were written after
the</p>
<p>Restoration, but both men were molded under the Puritan regime. “I
was of a low and inconsiderable generation [birth],” he tells us, “my
father’s house being of that rank that is meanest and most despised of
all families in the land.” 4 The father was a tinker — a mender of pots
and kettles — in the village of Elstow, near Bedford. Thomas Bunyan
earned enough to send John to Bedford School, where the boy learned at
least to read and write — enough to “search the Scriptures” and write
the most famous of all English books. At home he served as apprentice to
his father, who taught him the catechism on Sunday afternoons. From the
boys of the town he learned to lie and blaspheme; in the se arts, he
assures us, “I had but few equals.” E Moreover, he was guilty of
dancing, playing games, and taking a glass of ale in the tavern — all
condemned by the Puritans, who in his youtb (1628- 48) were not yet in
power. “I was the very ringleader… in all</p>
<p>manner of vice and ungodliness.” 6 Such confessions of mighty sins
were popular among the Puritans, since they made their reform all the
more remarkable, and showed the power of God’s saving grace. As the
Puritan teaching spread around him, Bu nyan’s deviltry was disturbed by
thoughts of death, the Last Judgment, and hell. Once he dreamed that he
saw all the sky on fire, and the earth splitting beneath him. He woke in
terror, and frightened the family with his cries: “O Lord, have mercy on
me !… The Day of Judgment is come, and I am not prepared!” T</p>
<p>At sixteen he was drafted into the Parliamentary army, and he served
for thirty months in the Civil War. As a soldier, “I sinned still, and
grew more and more rebellious against God, and careless of my own
salvation.” 8 Demobilized, he married (1648) an orphan girl whose only
dowry was two religious books and her oft- repeated memories of her
father’s piety. Bunyan, having succeeded to his father’s sh op,
supported her by tinkering. He prospered, went to church regularly, and
abandoned one by one his youthful sins. Almost daily he read the Bible,
whose simple English became his own. Elstow talked of him as a model
citizen.</p>
<p>But (he tells us) theological doubts harassed him. He had no
conviction that God’s grace had been extended to him, and without that
grace he would be damned. He suspected that nearly all the inhabitants
of Elstow and Bedford were already lost to everlasting hell. He was
troubled with the thought that his Christian beliefs were a geographical
accident. “How can you tell,” he asked himself, “but that the Turks had
as good scriptures to prove their Mahomet the Saviour, as we have to
prove our Jesus is?” 9 “Whole floods of blasp hemies against God,
Christ, and the Scriptures was</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>poured upon my spirit… questions in me against the very being of God
and of his only beloved Son, as whether there was in truth a God or
Christ? And whether the Holy Scriptures were not rather a fable and
cunning story than the holy and pure Word of God?” 10 He concluded that
these doubts were due to a devil that had lodged in him. “I beheld the
condition of the dog and toad, and counted the estate of everything that
God had made far better than this dreadful state of mine… , for they had
no souls to perish under the everlasting weight of hell or sin, as mine
was like to do.” 11</p>
<p>Then one day, as he was walking into the countryside, musing on the
wickedness of his heart, he remembered a line of St. Paul’s: “He hath
made peace through the blood of His cross.” 12 The thought that Christ
had died for him as well as for others grew stronger in his mind, until
“I was ready to swoon… wi th solid joy and peace.” 13 He joined a
Baptist church in Bedford (1653), was baptized, and entered upon two
years of spiritual happiness and tranquillity. In 1655 he moved to
Bedford and became a deacon in this church, and in 1657 he was
commissioned to preach. His message was Luther’s: that unless a man had
firm faith that he had been redeemed from his natural sinfulness by the
death of Christ the Son of God, he would — no matter what were his
virtues — join the great majority of mankind in going t o hell. Only
Christ’s divine self -sacrifice could balance the enormity of man’s
sins. Children, he thought, should be told this very clearly:</p>
<p>My judgment is that men go the wrong way to learn their children</p>
<p>o pray. It seems to me a better way for people to tell their children
betimes what cursed creatures they are, how they are under the wrath of
God by reason of original and actual sin; also to tell them the</p>
<p>nature of God’s wrath, and the duration of misery. 14</p>
<p>Amid these exhortations there was, in Bunyan’s sermons, much wise
counsel on the rearing of children and the treatment of employees. Like
other preachers he was subjected to heckling by the Quakers, who told
him that not the Scriptures but the Inner Light brought understanding
and salvation. In 1656 he wrote two books against the troublesome new
sect; they replied by accusing him of being a Jesuit, a highwayman, an
adulterer, and a witch. 15 Worse difficulties came with the Restoration.
The old Elizabethan law was renewed which required all Englishmen to
attend Anglican services, and only those; all non- Anglican houses of
worship were closed; all non-Anglican ministers were forbidden to
preach. Bunyan obeyed to the extent of closing his conventicle in
Bedford, but he met his congrega- tion in secret places, and preached to
it. He was arrested; he was offered release if he would promise not to
preach publicly; he refused; he was committed to Bedford jail (November,
1660). There, with some intervals</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>of limited liberty, he remained for twelve years. At different times
the offer of release was renewed, on the same conditions and eliciting
the same reply: “If you let me out today I will preach tomorrow.” 16</p>
<p>Perhaps domestic life had become a burden. His first wife had died in
1658, leaving him four children, one blind; and his second wife was</p>
<p>pregnant. The neighbors helped to support the family, and Bunyan con-
tributed by making laces in prison and arranging for their sale. His
wife and children were allowed to visit him daily, and he was permitted
to preach to his fellow prisoners, to leave the jail as he pleased, even
to travel to London. 17 But he resumed his clandestine sermons, and was
put in closer confinement. In jail he read and reread the Bible, and
Foxe’s Book of Martyrs ; he warmed</p>
<p>In 1666, under Charles II’s first Declaration of Indulgence, he
was</p>
<p>released. He preached again, and was returned to jail. In 1672
Charles’s second Declaration of Indulgence allowed nonconformist
ministers to preach. Bunyan was freed, and was at once elected pastor of
his old church. In 1673 this declaration was withdrawn; the old
prohibitions were renewed, Bunyan disobeyed them, he was again
imprisoned (1675), but he was soon released.</p>
<p>It was in this third and final term that he wrote Part I of The
Pilgrim’s Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come. This was
published in 1678; Part II followed in 1684. (In an amusing doggerel
preface Bunyan claimed that he had written the book to divert himself,
without thought of publication.) He presented the story disarmingly in
the form of fantasy:</p>
<p>As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a</p>
<p>certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place
to</p>
<p>sleep; and as I slept I dreamed a dream. 18</p>
<p>Christian, in this vision, is obsessed with the thought that he
must</p>
<p>abandon and forget everything else, and seek only Christ and
Paradise. He leaves his wife and children, and begins his progress
toward the “Celes tial City.” He is joined by Hopeful, who expresses the
Puritan faith succinctly:</p>
<p>One day I was very said, I think sadder than at any time in my
life,</p>
<p>and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and
vileness of my sins. And as I was then looking for nothing but hell, and
the</p>
<p>everlasting damnation of my soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw
the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIII )</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>21 1</p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ look down from heaven upon me, and saying</p>
<p>“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.” 19 But I
replied, I am a great, a very great, sinner. And he answered, “My</p>
<p>grace is sufficient for thee.”… And now was my heart full of joy.
20</p>
<p>The pilgrims, after much tribulation and disputation, reach the
Celestial Gty, and we learn what it is they had hoped for so
fervently:</p>
<p>And lo, as they entered, they were transfigured, and they had</p>
<p>raiment put on that looked like gold. There were also that met them
with harps and crowns, and gave them to them — the harps to praise
withal, and the crowns in token of honor…. And behold, the City</p>
<p>shone like the sun; the streets also were paved with gold, and in
them walked many men, with crowns on their heads, palms in their hands,
and golden harps to sing praises withal. 21</p>
<p>Poor Ignorance, who has followed them haltingly, not having quite the
true faith, comes to the gates of the Celestial City, knocks, is asked
for his pass - port, cannot find it, and is bundled off to hell. 22 —
The story is engagingly told, but sometimes we sympathize with
Obstinate, who says of Christian and his fellows, “There is a company of
these crazy -headed coxcombs, that, when they take a fancy by the end,
are wiser in their own eyes than even men that ca n render a reason.”
23</p>
<p>The idea of the soul’s pilgrimage from earthly temptations to
heavenly bliss was old; so was the medieval allegorical form; presumably
Bunyan had read some of these earlier works. 24 They were now forgotten
in the extraordinary success of the new story. Fifty-nine editions were
printed in its first century of life; it sold 100,000 copies before
Bunyan’s death; it has sold millions since; it has been translated into
108 languages; in Puritan America it was in almost every home. Some of
its phrases — the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, Mr. Worldly Wiseman —
entered into common speech. In the twentieth century its popularity has
rapidly declined; the Puritan mood is gone; the book is now less a part
of man’s belie f and furniture; but it is still a well of simple English
fresh and clear.</p>
<p>Bunyan wrote some sixty books; they are not required reading today.
After his final release in 1675 he became one of the most prominent
preachers of his time, the recognized leader of the Baptists in England.
He expressed admiration for Charles II, and bade his followers be loyal
to the Stuart King as the defender of England against the pope. 25 Three
years after Charles declared his deathbed acceptance of Catholicism,
Bunyan finished his own career. His end was strangely like Luther’s. A
quarrel at Reading having alienated a father and son of whom Bunyan was
very fond, he journeyed thither on horseback from Bedford. He reconciled
the parties;</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>but on the ride back he was caught in a storm, and was wetted through
before he could find shelter on the way. A fever seized him, from which
he never recovered. He was buried in the cemetery of the Dissenters at
Bunhill Fields, where he still lies, in stone, on his tomb.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE YOUNG POET: 1 608-40</li>
</ol>
<p>Milton’s grandfather was a Roman Catholic, who was fined sixty pounds
in 1601 for skipping Anglican services, and who disinherited his son for
abandoning the Roman Church. This disowned John Milton earned a good
living as a London scrivener — a penman skilled in writing or copying
manuscripts, charters, and legal documents. He loved music, composed
madrigals, had many musical instruments, including an organ, in his
home; and this feeling for music passed down to the poet, who would have
agreed that to write well one must have music in his soul and in his
mental ear. The mother, Sarah Jeffrey, daughter of a merchant tailor,
gave her husband six children, of whom our John was the third. A younger
brother,</p>
<p>Christopher, became a Stuart royalist and High Church man; John
became a Cromwellian Puritan republican. The home in Bread Street was a
Puritan establishment, serious and devout but not puritanic; the
Renaissance love of the beautiful mingled here with the Reformation
passion for the good.</p>
<p>John senior bought realty, prospered, engaged tutors (Puritan) for
John junior, and sent him, aged eleven, to St. Paul’s School. There the
boy learned Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and some Hebrew. He read
Shake- speare, but preferred Spenser; we note in passing that he was
much impressed by an English translation of Du Barns’ La Semaine (1578),
an epic describing the creation of the world in seven days.</p>
<p>My appetite for knowledge was so voracious that from twelve years of
age I hardly ever left my studies, or went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>This primarily led to my loss of sight. My eyes [like his
mother’s]</p>
<p>were naturally weak, and I was subject to frequent headaches, which,
however, could not chill the ardor of my curiosity, or retard the</p>
<p>progress of my improvement. 28</p>
<p>At sixteen he passed to Christ’s College, Cambridge. There his
quarrel with a tutor led to fisticuffs. Samuel Johnson was “ashamed to
relate what I fear is true, that Milton was one of the last students in
either university that suffered the public indignity of corporal
correction.” 27 Milton was expelled for a term, then was allowed to
return. Already he was writing good poetry. In 1629, aged twenty-one, he
celebrated with a magnificent ode “the Morning of Christ’s Nativity,”
and a year later he composed a sixteen -</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>2I 3</p>
<p>line “Epitaph,” which was later accepted for publication in the
Second Folio edition (1632) of Shakespeare’s works:</p>
<p>What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones</p>
<p>The labour of an Age in piled stones,</p>
<p>Or that his hallow’d Reliques should be hid</p>
<p>Under a Star-ypointing Pyramid?</p>
<p>Dear Sonne of Memory, great Heire of Fame,</p>
<p>What need’st thou such dull witnesse of thy Name?*</p>
<p>Milton stayed eight years at Cambridge, taking the bachelor’s degree
in 1628, the master’s in 1632; then he left without the usual affection
for the scene of one’s college years. His father had expected him to
enter the ministry, but the proud youth refused to take the oath of
loyalty to the Anglican creed and liturgy:</p>
<p>Perceiving what tyranny had invaded the Church — that he who</p>
<p>would take orders must subscribe slave, and take an oath withal,</p>
<p>which unless he took with a conscience that would retch, he must</p>
<p>either straight perjure or split his faith — I thought it better to
prefer a blameless silence before the sacred office of speaking,
bought…</p>
<p>with servitude and forswearing. 29</p>
<p>He retired to his father’s country house at Horton, near Windsor;
there, apparently, he was paternally maintained while he pursued his
studies, chiefly classical. He became familiar with even the most minor
of the Latin authors. He wrote Latin poems that won the praise of a
Roman Catholic cardinal; soon he was to make Europe resound with his
Latin defenses of Cromwell’s policies. Even when he w rote English prose
he wrote Latin, bending the English to classical inversions and
convolutions, but achieving a strange and fascinating sonority.</p>
<p>Probably it was at Horton, amid the lush fields and greenery of
an</p>
<p>English countryside, that he composed (1632?) the companion pieces
that celebrated in turn the careless joys and melancholy moods of his
passing youth. Almost every line of “L’ Allegro” cries out to be sung.
Allegro is the “daughter fair,… buxom, blithe, and debonair,” born of
“Zephyr with Aurora playing.” Everything in the rural scene now delights
the poet: the lark startling the night, the cock strutting before his
dames, the hounds leaping at the blowing of the hunter’s horn, the sun
rising “in flames and amber light,” the singi ng milkmaid and the
nibbling flocks, the dance of youth and maiden on the grass, the evening
by the hearth or at the theater.</p>
<p>We regret to add that when Milton was assigned the task of defending
the execution of Charles I, he listed, among the blots on that monarch’s
memory, a fondness for Shake - speare. 28</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>

<p>If Jonson’s learned sock be on,</p>

<p>and music</p>
<p>Untwisting all the chains that tie</p>
<p>The hidden soul of harmony;…</p>
<p>These delights if thou canst give,</p>
<p>Mirth, with thee I mean to live.</p>
<p>Here was as yet no grim or joyless Puritan, but a healthy English
youth in whose veins ran some ichor of the Elizabethan bards.</p>
<p>But there came at times another mood, when these pleasures seemed
trivial to the pensive mind remembering tragedy, seeking significance,
and finding in philosophy no answers, but only questions unfelt before.

<p>These are the pleasures that come to “the pensive one,” and if they
seem tied to Melancholy, then with Melancholy will the poet live. In
these two lovely poems Milton reveals himself at twenty-four: a youth
atremble with life’s beauties and unashamed of happiness, but already
touched with puzzled reveries on life and death, feeling in himself the
conflict of religion with philosophy.</p>
<p>The poet’s first chance to distinguish himself came in 1634, when he
was commissioned to write a pastoral masque for the ceremonies inaugu-
rating the Earl of Bridgewater as lord president of the Council of the
West. Henry Lawes composed the middling music; Milton’s verses, mod -
estly anonymous, were so praised that he was moved to acknowledge their
authorship. Sir Henry Wotton commended “a certain Doric delicacy in your
songs and odes, whereunto… I have seen yet nothing parallel in our
language.” 30 Originally the piece was entitled A Masque Presented at
Ludlow Castle (in Shropshire) ; today we call it Comus. It was performed
by two young nobles and their sister, a seventeen-year-old girl from the
court of Queen Henrietta Maria. Though most of the little drama is in
blank verse, much trammeled with mythology, it has a lyric lilt and</p>
<p>melodious elegance better sustained than ever again in Milton’s
poetry. The theme was traditional: a lovely virgin, wandering recklessly
in the woods, and singing</p>
<p>strains that might create a soul</p>
<p>Under the ribs of death,</p>
<p>is accosted by the sorcerer Comus, who casts upon her a charm to
loose her chastity. He begs her to make play while her youth shines; she
with warm eloquence defends virtue, temperance, and “divine philosophy.”
All the lines went well, except perhaps an ominously republican passage
that may have made that lavish gathering wince:</p>
<p>If every just man that now pines with want</p>
<p>Had but a modest and beseeming share</p>
<p>Of that which lewdly- pamper’d Luxury</p>
<p>Now heaps upon some few with vast excess.</p>
<p>Nature’s full blessings would be well dispenc’t</p>
<p>In unsuperfluous even proportion,</p>
<p>And she no whit encombered with her store. 31</p>
<p>In 1637 the poet’s mood was darkened by the drowning of his young
friend and fellow poet Edward King. To a memorial volume Milton con-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>ributed an elegy, “Lycidas,” conceived in artificial pastoral form,
and cluttered with dead gods, but rich in lines that still ring in
grateful memory:</p>
<p>Alas! what boots it with incessant care</p>
<p>To tend the homely slighted shepherd’s trade,*</p>
<p>And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?</p>
<p>Were it not better done as others use,</p>
<p>To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,</p>
<p>Or with the tangles of Neaera’s hair?</p>
<p>Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise</p>

<p>And think to burst out into sudden blaze.</p>
<p>Comes the blind Fury with th’abho rred shears,</p>
<p>And slits the thin-spun life.</p>
<p>John Milton senior seems to have felt that six years of leisurely
in-</p>
<p>dulgence at Horton were well earned by a talent that could sing such
songs. To crown his generosity, he sent his son to travel on the
Continent, all expenses paid. Equipped with a manservant, Milton left
England in April, 1638, spent a few days in Paris (then in the martial
grip of Richelieu), and hurried on to Italy. During a stay of two months
in Florence he</p>
<p>visited the blind and half-imprisoned Galileo, met the literati, sat
in with the academies, exchanged compliments in Latin verse, and wrote
Italian sonnets as if he had been reared by the Arno or the Po. In
Naples he was received and escorted by that same Marquis Manso who had
befriended Tasso and Marini. He spent four months in Rome, met and liked
some learned cardinals, but frankly confessed his Protestant faith. Then
again to Florence, and through Bologna and Ferrara to Venice, through
Verona to Milan, and through Geneva, Lyons, and Paris to London
(August,</p>
<p>1639).</p>
<p>In later works he made two notable statements about his travels in
Italy. Rebutting the insinuations of an opponent, he wrote: “I call God
to wit- ness that in all those places in which vice meets with so little
discourage- ment, and is practiced with so little shame, I never once
deviated from the paths of integrity and virtue.” 32 And, recalling how
the Italian critics had praised his poetry,</p>
<p>I began thus far to assent both to them and divers of my friends</p>
<p>here at home, and not less to an inward prompting which now grew
daily upon me, that by labor and intent study (which I take to be my</p>
<p>I.e., to write poetry.</p>

<p>217</p>
<p>portion in this life), joined with the strong propensity of nature,
I</p>
<p>might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes, as they
should not willingly let it die. 33</p>
<p>Now he began to plan a great epic that would celebrate his nation or
his faith, and enshrine his name in centuries. Twenty years were to pass
before he could begin it, twenty-nine before he could publish it.
Between the first period of his poetry (1630-40) and the second
(1658-68) he played his part in the Great Rebellion, and kept his pen
for war and prose.</p>
<p>in. the reformer: 1640-42</p>
<p>In 1639 Milton took a bachelor’s apartment in St. Bride’s Churchyard,
London, where he tutored his sister’s sons. A year later he moved with
them to Aldersgate Street. There (1643) he received additional pupils
be- tween ten and sixteen years of age, boarded and taught them, and
earned a modest income to fill out the allowance from his father. In a
“Letter to Mr. Hartlib” (1644) he formulated his views on education. He
gave the word a mighty definition: “I call a complete and generous
education that which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully, and
magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and
war.” 34 The first task of the teacher is to form moral cha racter in
the student, “to repair the ruins of our first parents” — i.e., to
overcome the natural wickedness of man (“origi - nal sin”) — or (as we
should now say) to readjust to the needs of civilized life the native
character formed by the needs of the hunting stage. This, Milton felt,
can be done best by inculcating in the growing mind a strong faith in an
all-seeing God, and inuring it to self-control by a stoic discipline. He
set his pupils an example of “hard study and spare diet,” seldom per - m
itting himself a day of “festivity and enjoyment.” 35 Next to religion
and morals should come the Greek and Latin classics, which Milton used
not merely as models of literature but as vehicles of instruction in
natural science, geography, history, law, morality, physiology,
medicine, agricul- ture, architecture, oratory, poetry, philosophy, and
theology. If this unique compromise between science and the humanities
assumed that very little had been added to science since the fall of
Rome, we should note that this was substantially true except for
Galileo; even Copernicus had had his Greek forebear in Aristarchus.
Moreover, Milton proposed also to acquaint his students with some modern
texts in science and history, and even some living exemplars in
practical arts; he hoped to bring hunters, mariners, gardeners,
anatomists, apothecaries, engineers, architects to his classroom to
convey the latest knowledge in their fields. 36 He allotted
considerable</p>
<p>2 l8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>ime to music and drama, and an hour and a half every day to athletic
exercises and martial games. “In vernal seasons” his pupils would “ride
out in companies with prudent and staid guides to all quarters of the
land, learning and observing”; they would “join the navy for a while to
learn sailing and sea- fight”; and finally, after their twenty - third
year, they might travel abroad. It was an arduous curriculum; we have no
evidence that it was fully followed in Milton’s school; but if his
students cau ght some of his enthusiasm and industry, it might have been
realized.</p>
<p>He dreamed at times of developing an academy that should rival those
of Plato and Aristotle, but his spirit was allured by the epochal events
of the age. The gathering of the Long Parliament (1640) was a turning
point in his life, an almost violent veering from poetry and scholarship
to politics and reform. On December 1 1 the “Root and Branch” party of
the Puritans, to which some of his friends belonged, presented to
Parliament a monster petition, signed with fifteen thousand names
(probably including Mil- ton’s 37 ) and asking for the elimination of
bishops from the English Church. Joseph Hall, bishop of Exeter,
countered the petition with An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of
Parliament (January, 1641), in which he defended episcopacy as derived
“from the times of the blessed Apostles, without interruption… unto the
present age.” 38 Five Presbyterian divines joined their pens in An
Answer to… an Humble Remonstrance (March,</p>
<p>1641), which they signed “Smectymnuus,” a pseudonym made up of their
initials.* Hall and other episcopal-ians replied; the Commons passed the
proposal, the Lords rejected it; the controversy boiled in pulpit,
press, and Parliament; and Milton leaped into it with a ninety-page
booklet, Of Reformation Touching Church Discipline in England (June,
1641).</p>
<p>With powerful and breathless sentences running at times to half a
page, he ascribed the deterioration of the Established Church to two
causes: the retention of Catholic ceremonies, and the episcopal monopoly
of the power to ordain. He scorned “those senseless ceremonies which we
only retain as a dangerous earnest of sliding back to Rome, and serving
merely as… an interlude [drama] to set out the pomp of prelatism.” 39
The</p>
<p>bishops have been stealthily moving back to Catholicism in their
ritual — a palpable hit at Archbishop Laud, who had been offered a
cardinal’s hat. Milton repudiated the claim of James I and Charles I
that bishops were necessary to church government and monarchical
institutions. He called upon the Presbyterian Scots to continue their
old war against episcopacy; and he appealed to the Trinity to serve in
the good cause:</p>
<p>Thou Tripersonal godhead! look upon this thy poor and almost</p>
<p>spent and expiring church; leave her not thus a prey to those impor-

<p>unate wolves, that wait and think long till they devour thy
tender</p>
<p>flock; these wild boars that have broke into thy vineyard, and left
the print of their polluting hoofs on the souls of thy servants. O let
them not bring about their damned designs, that stand now at the
entrance of the bottomless pit, expecting the watchward to open and let

pitchy</p>
<p>cloud of infernal darkness, where we shall never more see the sun of
thy truth again, never hope for the cheerful dawn, never more hear the
bird of morning sing. 48</p>
<p>He ended by consigning the High Church party to hell:</p>
<p>But they… that by the impairing and diminution of the true faith,</p>
<p>he distresses and servitude of their country aspire to high
dignity,</p>
<p>rule, and promotion here, after a shameful end in this life (which
God grant them) shall be thrown down eternally into the darkest and</p>
<p>deepest gulf of hell, where, under the despiteful control, the
trample and spurn of all the other damned, that in the anguish of their
torture shall have no other ease than to exercise a raving and bestial
tyranny over them as their slaves and negroes, they shall remain in that
plight forever, the basest, the lowermost, the most dejected, most
underfoot and downtrodden vassals of perdition. 41</p>
<p>When Bishop Hall answered and abused the “Sinectymnuans,” Milton came
to their support with a blast that must have shaken the sixty-five-
year-old prelate out of his canonicals. The Animadversions upon the
Remonstrant’s Defence against Smectymnwus appeared anonymously in July,
1641. In a preface Milton apologized for his vehemence:</p>
<p>In the detecting and convincing [convicting] of any notorious</p>
<p>enemy to truth and his country’s peace, especially that is
conceited</p>
<p>o have a voluble and smart influence of tongue… , it will be nothing
disagreeing from Christian meekness to handle such a one in a rougher
accent, and to send home his haughtiness well besprinkled with his</p>
<p>own holy water. 42</p>
<p>The bishop and his son came back with A Modest Confutation (January
[?], 1642), attacking the author of the Animadversions in the hot manner
of that infuriate age. 43 Milton retorted in An Apology against… a
Modest Confutation (April ?). He further excused his rough treatment of
the bishop; he denounced as a “commodious lie” the charge that he,
Milton, had been “vomited” from Cambridge; he assured the world that the
Fel- lows of Christ’s College had invited him to stay with them after
his gradua - tion; and he reaffirmed his impugned chastity:</p>
<p>220 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VTO</p>
<p>Though Christianity had been but slightly taught me, yet a
certain</p>
<p>reservedness of natural disposition, and moral discipline learned out
of the noblest philosophy, was enough to keep me in disdain of far</p>
<p>less incontinences than this of the bordello. But having had the</p>
<p>doctrine of Holy Scripture, unfolding those chaste and high mys-</p>
<p>eries… , that “the body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the body,”
thus also I argued to myself, that if unchastity in a woman, whom
St.</p>
<p>Paul terms the glory of man, be such a scandal and dishonor, then</p>
<p>certainly in a -man, who is both the image and glory of God, it</p>
<p>must… be much more deflouring and dishonorable, in that he sins</p>
<p>both against his own body, which is the perfecter sex, and his
own</p>
<p>glory, which is in the woman, and, that which is worst, against
the</p>
<p>image and glory of God, which is in himself. 41</p>
<p>Therefore Milton deplored the morality of many classic poets, and
pre- ferred to them Dante and Petrarch,</p>
<p>who never write but honor of them to whom they devote their verse,
displaying sublime and pure thoughts, without transgression. And</p>
<p>long it was not after, when I was confirmed in this opinion, that
he</p>
<p>who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well… ought him- self
to be a true poem; that is, a composition and pattern of the best and
honorablest things; not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men, or
famous cities, unless he have in himself the experience and practice of
all which is praiseworthy. 45</p>
<p>After this exemplary passage Milton proceeded to talk of the bishop’s
so cks and feet sending a “fouler stench to heaven”; and if such
language should seem uncongenial to theology, he defended it by “the
rules of the best rhetoricians,” and the example of Luther; and he
reminded his readers that “Christ himself, speaking of unsavory
traditions, scruples not to name the dunghill and the jakes.” 46</p>
<p>But enough of this dreary controversy, so quotable because of the
light it sheds on Milton’s character and the manners of the time, and
because, amid the virulent nonsense, the grammatical chaos, and the
sesquipedalian sentences, there are passages of organlike prose as
splendid and moving as Milton’s verse. Meanwhile (March, 1642) he had
published over his own name a more impersonal booklet, The Reason of
Church Government Urged against Prelaty — “this impertinent yoke of
prelaty under whose inquisitorious and tyrannous duncery no free and
splendid wit [intelli- gence] can flourish.” 47 He admitted the
necessity of moral and social dis - cipline; indeed, he saw in the rise
and fall of discipline the key to the rise and fall of states.-</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>There is not that thing in the world of more grave and urgent im-</p>
<p>portance throughout the whole life of man than discipline. What need
I instance? He that hath read with judgment of nations and common-
wealths… will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all
civil societies, all the movements and turnings of human occasions, are
moved to and fro as upon the axle of Discipline…. Nor is there any
sociable perfection in this life, civil or sacred, that can be above
Dis- cipline; but she is that which with her musical cords preserves
and</p>
<p>holds all the parts thereof together. 48</p>
<p>Such discipline, however, should be derived not from an
ecclesiastical hierarchy, but from the conception of every man as a
potential priest.</p>
<p>As at all stages Milton was conscious of his own abilities, he
prefaced the second part of his treatise with an autobiographical
fragment mourn- ing that the controversy had diverted him from the
composition of a great work which he had long had in mind, “that what
the greatest and choicest wits of Athens, Rome, or modern Italy, and
those Hebrews of old, did for their country, I, in my proportion, with
this over and above, of being a Christian, might do for mine.” 49 He
told how already he was examining subjects for such a work, but wished
it to be one that would allow him “to paint out and describe… the whole
book of sanctity and virtue,” and “whatsoever in religion is holy and
sublime.” 50 And as if foreseeing that sixteen years would pass before
the Great Rebellion would let him set his pen to this task, he excused
his tardiness:</p>
<p>Neither do I think it shame to covenant with any knowing reader,</p>
<p>hat for some few years yet I may go on trust with him toward the</p>
<p>payment of what I am now indebted, as being a work not to be raised
from the heat of youth, or the vapours of wine, like that which flows at
waste from the pen of some vulgar amourist, or the trencher fury of a
rhyming parasite; nor to be obtained by the invocation of Dame Memory
and her siren daughters; but by devout prayer to that eternal Spirit who
can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and sends</p>
<p>out his Seraphim, with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch
and</p>
<p>purify the lips of whom he pleases: to this must be added industrious
and select reading, steady observation, insight into all seemly and gen-
erous arts and affairs; till which in some measures be compassed, at
mine own peril and cost, I refuse not to sustain this expectation from
as many as are not loth to hazard so much credulity upon the best</p>
<p>pledges that I can give them. 51</p>

<li>MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE: 1 643-48</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Modest Confutation Bishop Hall had charged that Milton was
seeking literary fame, and advertising his abilities and background, in
order to win “a rich widow” or some other reward. In the Apology</p>
<p>Milton ridiculed the idea; on the contrary, he had been “bred up in
plenty,” needed no rich widow, and held “with them who, both in prudence
and elegance of spirit, would choose a virgin of mean fortunes, honestly
bred, before the wealthiest widow.” 32 While England drifted into Civil
War (1642), Milton drifted into marriage (1643).</p>
<p>He did not join the Parliamentary army; and when the King’s
forces</p>
<p>neared London (November 12, 1642), he wrote a sonnet advising
Royalist commanders to protect the poet’s house and person, as Alexander
had protected Pindar, and promising to spread their fame in verse for
“such gentle acts as these.” 53 However, the Royalist troops were turned
back, and M ilton’s bower was left unharmed to greet his wife.</p>
<p>He had met Mary Powell in Forest Hill in Oxfordshire, where her
father was a justice of the peace. This Richard Powell, far back in
1627, had acknowledged his indebtedness to Milton, then at Cambridge, in
the sum of X500, which was later commuted to ^312, which had not yet
been paid. Apparently the poet spent a month with the Powells in
May-June, 1643 — whether to collect a debt or a wife we know not. John
may have felt that at thirty-four it was time he should marry and beget;
and Mary, seventeen, apparently had the virginity that he required. He
surprised his nephews by returning to London with a wife.</p>
<p>No one was happy long. The nephews resented Mary as an intruder. She
resented Milton’s books, and missed her mother, and the “great deal of
company and merriment, dancing, etc.,” which she had enjoyed in Forest
Hill; “Oftimes,” says Aubrey, “she heard his nephews beaten and cry.” 54
Finding that Mary had but a few id eas, and those Royalist, Milton sank
back into his books. He spoke later of a “mute and spiritless mate,” and
mourned that “a man shall find himself bound fast to an image of earth
and phlegm, with whom he looked to be the co-partner of a sweet and gla
dsome society.” 35 Some inquirers into the mesalliance believe that</p>
<p>published, The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce (August, 1643). He
dedicated it “To the Parliament of England, with the Assembly” — i.e.,
the Westminster Assembly that was then drawing up a confession of
the</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Presbyterian faith. He begged the Parliament to free itself from the
bondage of tradition, and to advance the Reformation by admitting other
grounds than adultery for divorce. He proposed to show</p>
<p>hat indisposition, unfitness, or contrariety of mind, arising from
a</p>
<p>cause in nature unchangeable, hindering and ever likely to hinder the
main benefits of conjugal society, which are solace and peace, is a</p>
<p>greater reason of divorce than natural frigidity, especially if there
be no children, and that there be mutual consent. 57</p>
<p>He quoted the old Jewish law of Deut. xxiv, 1: “When a man hath taken
a wife and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in
his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her, let him write
her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
the</p>
<p>house.” Christ had apparently rejected this part of the Mosaic Law:
“It hath been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a
writing of divorcement; but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put
away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to
commit adultery.” (Matt, v, 31- 32.) Milton argued that “Christ mean t
not to be taken word for word,” 58 and had repeatedly avowed that he had
not come to change one iota of the Mosaic Law. He struggled to make his
broad interpretation cover his individual case, even to justifying
divorce for inability to join in “a fit and matchable conversation”; for
“the unfitness and defectiveness of an unconjugal mind” can reduce
matrimony to “a worse condition than the loneliest single life,” wherein
a living soul is tied to a corpse. 59</p>
<p>The little book sold rapidly, for it was universally denounced.
Milton published in February, 1644, a second edition, eloquently
enlarged and boldly signed. He replied to his critics learnedly in T
etrachordon, and in a lighter vein in Colasterion (both issued in March
4, 1645), heaping upon them his rich vocabulary of vituperation — clod,
pork, boar, snout, cock- brained solicitor, brazen ass, odious and
odorous fool. 60 Milton could leap in one page from the heights of
Parnassus to a Tartarus of scurrility.</p>
<p>Having failed to secure from Parliament a change in the law of
divorce, he decided to defy the law and take another wife, preferably a
Miss Davis, of whom we know nothing except that she refused him. When
rumor of this courtship reached Mary Powell, she decided to recapture
her husband, for better or for worse, before it should be too late. One
day, when Milton was visiting a friend, she came upon him suddenly,
knelt before him, and begged to be restored to his bed and board. He
hesitated; his friends pleaded her cause; he consented. With her, his
father, and his pupils, he now took a larger house in Barbican Street.
Soon Mary’s parents, im - poverished by the collapse of the Royalist
cause, came also to live with the poet, making such a household as must
have made for madness or</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>2 2 4</p>
<p>philosophy. Another addition arrived in 1646 — Milton’s first child,
Anne. Richard Powell mitigated the mess by dying (July), and John
Milton</p>
<p>senior completed a long and honorable life in the following March.
The poet fell heir to two or three houses in London, some money, and
per- haps some realty in the countryside. In 1647 he disbanded his
school, and moved with his wife, daughter, and two nephews to High
Holborn Street. A second daughter, Mary, was born in 1648.</p>
<p>V. FREEDOM OF THE PRESS: 1 643-49</p>
<p>On August 13, 1644, a Presbyterian clergyman, Herbert Palmer, preach-
ing before the two houses of Parliament, proposed that Milton’s treat
ise on divorce should be publicly burned. It was not, but Palmer’s
complaint may have led the Stationers’ Company, composed of the English
book - sellers, to point out to the Commons (August 24) that books and
pamphlets were violating the law requiring them to be registered and
licensed by the company. This law was as old as the reign of Elizabeth,
but on June 14, 1643, Parliament had reinforced it with an ordinance
specifying</p>
<p>hat no… book, pamphlet, paper, nor part of any such… shall… be
printed… or put to sale… unless the same be first approved</p>
<p>and licensed under the hands of such… persons as both or either of
the… Houses shall appoint for the licensing of the same, and entered
into the Register Book of the Company of Stationers according to</p>
<p>ancient custom. 61</p>
<p>Any violation was to be punished by the arrest of the authors and
printers concerned.</p>
<p>Milton had regularly neglected to register his prose publications.
Though The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce appeared two months after
the ordinance, he ignored the requirements. Perhaps he was persona grata
to the Parliament because he had supported it in its conflict with the
King; in any case it let him alone. But that ordinance remained over his
head, and over the heads of all authors in Britain. It seemed to Milton
impossible that literature cquld prosper under such censorship. Of what
use to depose a king and a censorious episcopacy if Parliament and
Church were to con- tinue inquisition over the speech of Englishmen? On
November 24, 1643, he sent forth, unregistered and unlicensed, the
noblest of his prose works: Areopagitica:A Speech of Mr. John Milton for
the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing, to the Parliament of England* Here
is no invective, no vitupera-</p>
<ul>
<li>Areopagitica meant matters pertaining to the supreme court of
Athens, which was called the Areopagus from the hill where it convened.
Milton took the title from a pam- phlet addressed to the Areopagus by
Isocrates in 355 B. C,</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>ion; the “speech” is kept to a high level of language and thought.
Milton respectfully asks Parliament to reconsider its censorship
ordinance as tend- ing to “the discouragement of all learning… by
hindering and cropping the discovery that might be yet further made both
in religious and civil Wisdom.” And he proceeds in a famous and
magnificent passage:</p>
<p>I deny not but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church
and</p>
<p>Commonwealth to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves, as
well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest
justice on them as malefactors. For books are not absolutely dead</p>
<p>hings, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as
that soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a
vial</p>
<p>he purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that
bred</p>
<p>hem. I know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as
those fabulous dragon’s teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to
spring up armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be
used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man</p>
<p>kills a reasonable creature, God’s image; but he who destroys a good
book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the
eye. Many a man lives a burden to the earth; but a good book is the pre-
cious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on pur-
pose to a life b eyond life. ’Tis true, no age can restore a life,
whereof perhaps there is no loss; and revolutions of ages do not oft
recover</p>
<p>he loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare
the worse.</p>
<p>We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against</p>
<p>he living labours of public men, how we spill that seasoned life
of</p>
<p>man preserved and stored up in books; since we see a kind of hom-</p>
<p>icide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom, and if it</p>
<p>extend to the whole impression, a kind of massacre; whereof the ex-
ecution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at
that ethereal and fifth essence, the breath of reason itself, slays an
im-</p>
<p>mortality rather than a life. 62</p>
<p>He cites the intellectual vitality of ancient Athens, where only
those writings were censored which were atheistical and libelous; “thus
the books of Protagoras were by the judges of the Areopagus commanded to
be burnt, and himself banished the territory, for a discourse beginning
with his confessing not to know ’whether there were gods, or whether
not/” Milton praises the government of ancient Rome for allowing much
free- dom to writers, and then sketches the growth of censorship in
Imperial Rome and the Catholic Church. This licensing ordinance, he
feels, smacks of “popery.” “What advantage is it to be a man, over it is
to be a boy at school, if we have only scaped the ferula to come under”
another Im - primatur ? 68 Governments and their licensers are fallible;
let them not en-</p>
<p>22 6 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>force their preferences upon the people; rather let the people choose
and learn, even if by costly trial and error:</p>
<p>I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and</p>
<p>unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversaries, but
slinks out of the race…. 64 Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and
to</p>
<p>argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties. 65… Though
all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth, so</p>
<p>Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by licensing and
prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood grapple;
who ever</p>
<p>knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter? 66</p>
<p>However, Milton does not ask for complete tolerance of publications;
he believes that atheism, libel, and obscenity should be outlawed, and
he refuses toleration to Catholicism because it is an enemy of the state
and is itself intolerant. 67 A state otherwise free in thought and
speech must, other things equal, grow into greatness.</p>
<p>Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation, rousing</p>
<p>herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible
locks. Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and
kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday bloom… 68</p>
<p>Parliament paid no attention to Milton’s plea; on the contrary, it
legis - lated with increased severity (in 1647, 1649, and 1653) against
unlicensed printing. Members of the Stationers’ Company protested that
Milton had not registered the Areopagitica; the House of Lords appointed
two justices to examine him; we do not know the result, but apparently
he was not molested; he was a useful voice for the triumphant
Puritans.</p>
<p>In February, 1649, only two weeks after the execution of Charles
I,</p>
<p>Milton published a pamphlet on The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates.
It accepted the social-contract theory that the authority of a
government is derived from the sovereign people, and that “it is lawful…
for any who have the power, to call to account a tyrant or wicked king,
and, after due conviction, to depose and put him to death.” 69 A month
later the Council of State of the revolutionary government invited
Milton to become its “secretary for foreign tongues.” He put his epic
aside, and for eleven years gave himself to the service of the Puritan
Commonwealth and Cromwell’s Protectorate.</p>

<p>MILTON</p>
<p>227</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE LATIN SECRETARY: 1 649-59</li>
</ol>
<p>The new regime needed a good Latinist to compose its foreign corre-
spondence. Milton was the obvious choice; he could write Latin, Italian,
and French like an ancient Roman, a Florentine, or a Parisian; and he
had proved through dangerous years his fidelity to the Parliamentary
cause against the bishops and the King. It was the Council, not
Cromwell, that engaged him; he had no close relations with the new
ruler, but he must have seen him frequently, and must have felt in his
thought and writing the nearness of that awesome personality. The
Council used Milton not merely to translate its foreign correspondence
into Latin, but to explain to other governments, by Latin brochures, the
justice of its domestic policies, and, above all, how reasonable had
been the decapitation of the</p>
<p>King-</p>
<p>In April, 1649, soon after his induction into office, Milton joined
with other employees of the Council in suppressing royalist and Leveller
pub- lications against the new regime. 70 Censorship was now more severe
than at any time in England’s history, following the general rule that
censorship increases with tbe insecurity of the government. The man who
had written the most eloquent appeal ever made for freedom of the press
was now looking at censorship from the view of the ruling power. We
should note, however, that in the Areopagitica Milton had allowed that
“it is of the greatest concernment in the Church and Commonwealth to
have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves, as well as men; and
thereafter to con- fine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as
malefactors.” 71</p>
<p>As John Lilburne was an especially troublesome Leveller, Milton was
instructed by the Council to write a reply to his radical pamphlet, New
Chains Discovered. We do not know if he carried out this assignment. But
he himself tells us 72 that he was “ordered” to answer the Eikon
Basilike. He complied by publishing (October 6, 1649) a book of 242
pages, en- titled Eikonoklastes (“Image Breaker”). Doubting but assuming
that the Eikon Basilike was what it purported to be, the work of Charles
I, Milton took up step by step the royalist argument, and countered it
with, all the force be could muster. He defended the policy of Cromwell
throughout, justified the execution of the King, and expressed his scorn
of the “incon - stant, irrational, and image-doting rabble… , a
credulous and helpless herd, begotten to servility… and enchanted with…
tyranny.” 73</p>
<p>Charles II, fretting on the Continent, paid Europe’s greatest
scholar, Claude Saumaise, to come to the defense of the dead King.
“Salmasius” hurriedly composed the Defensio Regia pro Carolo I, which
appeared at Leiden in November, 1649. He described Cromwell and his
followers as</p>
<p>228 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>“fanatical scoundrels… , the common enemy of the human race,” and
called upon all kings, for their own sake, to</p>
<p>fit out an armament for the extermination of these pests… Surely</p>
<p>he blood of the great King… calls to its revenge all monarchs and</p>
<p>princes of the Christian world. Nor can they appease his spirit
more</p>
<p>worthily than by restoring to his full rights the legitimate heir…
,</p>
<p>reseating him on his paternal throne… and slaying, as victims at the
tomb of the saintly dead, those most outrageous beasts who conspired for
the murder of so great a king. 74</p>
<p>Cromwell, fearing that this attack by a scholar of European fame
would intensify the resentment, general on the Continent, against his
government, asked Milton to answer Salmasius. The Latin secretary
labored at the task for almost a year, working at it by candlelight
despite his doctor’s warn - ing that he was slowly becoming blind. One
eye was already useless. On December 31, 1650, appeared Joannis Miltoni,
Angli, pro Populo Anglicano Defensio contra Claudii Salmasii Defensionem
Regiam. It began by taunt- ing Salmasius for selling his services to
Charles II, and went on to show that Salmasius only four years earlier
had written against episcopacy, which now he defended.</p>
<p>O you venal and fee-taking agent!… O the sneak and turncoat!</p>
<p>… You , silliest of blockheads, are worthy of the fool’s staff
itself</p>
<p>for thinking to persuade kings and princes to war with such
puerile</p>
<p>arguments… Do you then, without wit, without genius, a mouther</p>
<p>and a pettifogger, born only to rifle and transcribe good authors,
im- agine that you can produce anything of your own that will live —</p>
<p>you, whose foolish writings, bundled up with yourself, the next age,
believe me, will consign to oblivion? Unless perchance this Defensio
regia of yours shall owe something to the Answer to it, and shall</p>
<p>herefore, though already for some time neglected and laid to sleep,
be again taken up 78</p>
<p>— which is precisely what has happened. Salmasius had idealized
Charles I, Milton degrades him. He suspects Charles of having abetted
the Duke of Buckingham to poison his father, James I; he accuses the
dead King of “all kinds of viciousness” with the said Duke; he charges
Charles with kissing women at the theater, and of publicly fondling the
breasts ( papillas ) of virgins and matrons. 76 Salmasius had called
Milton many names; Milton retaliates by describing Salmasius as a fool,
beetle, ass, liar, slanderer, apostate, idiot, ignoramus, vagabond,
slave. He taunts Salmasius with being dominated by his wife, chides him
for Latin errors, invites him to hang himself, and guarantees him
admission to hell. 77 Thomas Hobbes, viewing</p>
<p>CHAP, vm)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>he rival books from some perch of philosophy, declared himself unable
to decide whose language was best, or whose arguments were worse. 78 The
Council of State gave Milton a vote of thanks.</p>
<p>Salmasius received a copy of Milton’s Defensio while at the court of
Queen Christina in Stockholm. He promised, but delayed, to reply. Mean-
while Milton passed from foreign to domestic affairs. In 1649 he moved
to a house in Charing Cross to be nearer his work. There his wife bore a
son, who soon died, and, in 1652, a daughter, Deborah, whose birth cost
the mother’s life. In that year Milton’s blindness became complete. Now
he wrote one of his greatest sonnets — “When I consider how my light is
spent.” The Council continued him aS Latin secretary, providing him with
an amanuensis.</p>
<p>In his darkness he suffered another loss: the republic that he had so
fervently hailed collapsed (1653) into a military monarchy, and
Cromwell, “Protector,” became in effect king. Milton resigned himself to
these de - velopments with the remark that “the ways of Providence are
inscru- table.” 79 He continued to admire Cromwell, and praised him as
“the greatest</p>
<p>He was soon called upon to defend the Protector against a powerful
indictment. In 1652 there had appeared a book whose very title was a
battle cry: Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parracidas</p>
<p>Anglicanos — The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven against the English
Parricides. It began with a description of Milton as “a monster hideous,
ugly, huge, bereft of sight,… a hangman,… a gallows bird.” It co m-</p>
<p>pared the execution of Charles I with the crucifixion of Christ, and
reckoned the regicide the greater crime. 81 It scorned the religious
professions of the “usurpers”:</p>
<p>The language of their public documents is stuffed with piety; the</p>
<p>style of Cromwell or his tribunes is to match; it would move any-</p>
<p>one’s bile and bitter laughter to mark with what impudence the
secret</p>
<p>Mahomet. 82</p>
<p>And the anonymous author, like Salmasius, appealed to the Continental
powers to invade England and restore the Stuart monarchy. The book
closed with an address “To the Be stial Blackguard John Milton, Advocate
of Parricides and Parricide,” and a hope that he would soon be
mercilessly flogged:</p>
<p>2 3 0</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Round this perjured head</p>
<p>Ply well the stick; lard every inch with weals,</p>
<p>Till you have thonged the carcass to one jelly.</p>
<p>Cease you already? Lay on, till he shed</p>
<p>Gall from his liver through his bleeding eyes. 88</p>
<p>The Council of State urged Milton to reply to this fury. He waited
a</p>
<p>while, expecting a blast from Salmasius, and hoping to impale both
an- tagonists upon one pen. But Salmasius died (1653), leaving his
rebuttal unfinished. Milton was misled into believing that the author of
the Regii Sanguinis Clamor was Alexander Morus, a pastor and scholar at
Middel- burg. He asked his correspondents in the United Provinces to
send him data about Morus’ public and private life. 84 Adrian Ulacq, the
printer of the book, wrote to Milton’s friend Hartlib, assuring him that
Morus was not the author, 85 but Milton refused to believe this, and
Amsterdam gossip agreed with him. In April, 1654, John Drurie wrote to
Milton warning him that he was mistaken in ascribing the Clamor to
Morus; Milton ignored the warning. On May 30 he published Joannis
Miltoni pro Populo Angli- cano Defensio Secunda.</p>
<p>The eloquence of these 173 pages is remarkable, for they were
dictated in Latin by a man completely blind. His enemies had described
that blind- ness as a divine punishment for egregious sins; Milton
replies that this cannot be, for he has led an exemplary life. He
rejoices that his first Defensio</p>
<p>so routed my opponent… that he yielded at once, broken alike in</p>
<p>spirit and reputation, and in the whole three years of his subsequent
life, though threatening and fuming much, gave us no further trouble,
save that he called to his aid the obscure labor of some utterly
des-</p>
<p>picable person, and suborned I know not what silly and extravagant
adulations to repatch by their eulogies, as far as might be, the unex-
pected and recent ruin of his character. 86</p>
<p>Turning upon his new enemy, Milton notes that morus in Greek meant
fool; he accuses him of heresy, profligacy, and fornication, of getting
Salmasius’ maidservant with child and then abandoning her. Even the
printer of the Clamor gets a lashing; everyone knows that he is a
“notorious cheat and bankrupt.” 87</p>
<p>In better humor Milton reviews the career of Cromwell. He defends the
campaigns in Ireland, the dissolutions of Parliament, the assumption of
supreme power. He addresses the Protector:</p>
<p>We all yield to your insuperable worth… Go on, therefore, in</p>
<p>vour magnanimous course, O Cromwell,… the liberator of your</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>23 1</p>
<p>country, the author of its freedom,… you who have excelled by</p>
<p>your actions hitherto not only the exploits of kings, but even
the</p>
<p>legendary adventures of our Heroes. 88</p>
<p>But after this obeisance he does not hesitate to advise the Protector
on policy. Cromwell should surround himself with men like Fleetwood and
Lambert (radicals); he should establish freedom of the press; he should
leave religion entirely separate from the state. No tithes should be
col- lected for the clergy; these men are already overfed; “all in
general is fat about them, even their intellects not excepted.” 89
Milton warns Cromwell that “if he, than whom none among us is reckoned
more just, more sa intly, or a better man, should afterwards invade that
Liberty which he has de- fended… , the result would be disastrous and
deadly, not only to him- self but also to the universal interests of
virtue and piety.” 90 By “Liberty” Milton makes plain that he does not
mean democracy. He asks the people:</p>
<p>Why should anyone assert for you the right of free suffrage, or
the</p>
<p>power of electing whom you will to the Parliament? Is it that you</p>
<p>should be able… to elect in the cities men of your faction, or
that</p>
<p>person in the boroughs, however worthy, who may have feasted your-
selves most sumptuously, or treated the country people and boors to the
greatest quantity of drink? Then we should have our members</p>
<p>of Parliament made for us not by prudence and authority, but by</p>
<p>faction and feeding; we should have vintners and hucksters from city
taverns, and graziers and cattlemen from the country districts. Should
one entrust the Commonwealth to those to whom nobody would en- trust a
matter of private business? 91</p>
<p>No, such universal suffrage would not be freedom.</p>
<p>To be free is the same thing exactly as to be pious, wise, just,
tem-</p>
<p>perate, self-providing, abstinent from the property of other people,
and in fine, to be magnanimous and brave. To be the opposite of all this
is the same as being a slave. And by the judgment of God it comes to
pass that a nation that cannot rule and govern itself, but has sur-
rendered itself in slavery to its own lusts, is surrendered also to
other masters… and made a slave both with and against its own will.
92</p>
<p>In October, 1654, Ulacq reprinted Milton’s Defensio Secunda at The
Hague, with an answer by Morus entitled Tides publica {Public Testi-
mony). In a preface the printer asserted that Morus was not the author
of the Clamor; that the manuscript had been given him (Ulacq) by
Salmasius, who had refused to reveal the author’s name. Morus solemnly
denied his authorship, affirmed that Milton had been repeatedly informed
of this, and</p>
<p>232 THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV (CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>charged that Milton had refused to alter the Defensio, since very
little of it would have remained if all the abuse of Morus had been
taken out. In August, 1655, Milton issued a volume of 204 pages, Pro se
Defensio (A Self- Defense ); he refused to, believe Morus’ denial; he
repeated the scandal about Salmasius’ maid, and added that the maid, in
a fair fight, had beaten Morus, knocked him down, and almost scratched
his eyes out. 93 In a sequel it appeared that a French Protestant
theologian, Pierre de Moulin, had written the Clamor, and that Morus had
edited it and written its dedica- tion. 94 When Morus was invited (1657)
to become the minister of a Re- formed church near Paris, the poet sent
several copies of his Defensio Secunda to the parish to prevent the
appointment. 95 The parish consistory accepted Morus nevertheless, and
he ended his troubled career (1670) as the most eloquent Protestant
preacher in or about Paris.</p>
<p>Milton appears in a softer fight in his powerful sonnet on the
Piedmont massacre of 1655.* It was probably he who wrote the letters by
which Cromwell appealed to the Duke of Savoy to end the persecution of
the Vaudois, and to Mazarin and the rulers of Sweden, Denmark, the
United Provinces, and the Swiss cantons to intercede with the Duke.</p>
<p>In 1656, after four years of widowhood, Milton married, sight unseen,
Katharine Woodcock. She proved a blessing to him, serving as patient
nurse to a blind and tempestuous husband, and mothering his three
daughters; but she died in 1658 in giving birth to a short-lived child.
That was a bitter year for Milton, since it took Cromwell too, and left
the Latin secretary to keep his post as best he could amid the chaos of
factions that reduced Richard Cromwell to a benevolent nonentity. Though
Milton must have known that England was now moving toward a Stuart
restora- tion, he issued a new edition (October, 1658) of his Pro Populo
Anglicano Defensio, justifying the execution of Charles I in terms that
almost courted martyrdom. In a characteristic preface he described this
first Defense as “a monument… not easily to perish,” claimed for it
divine inspiration, and ranked it only next to Cromwell’s deeds as
having saved England’s liberty. 96</p>
<p>He resisted with blind bravery the movement for recalling Charles II.
When Monck’s army reached London, and Parliament hesitated between a
republic and a monarchy, Milton published (February, 1660), as an
address to Parliament, an eighteen-page pamphlet, The Ready and Easy Way
to Establish a Free Commonwealth, and the Excellence Thereof Compared
with Inconveniences and Dangers of Readmitting Kingship in this Nation ;
and he boldly signed it “The author, J.M.” He pleaded with Parliament
not to make</p>
<p>See below, Chapter XVI, Section 1.</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>vain and viler than dirt the blood of so many thousand faithful
and</p>
<p>valiant Englishmen who left us this liberty, bought with our own</p>
<p>lives… What will they [our neighbors] at best say of us, and of
the</p>
<p>whole English name, but scoflingly, as of that foolish builder
men-</p>
<p>ioned by our Saviour, who began to build a tower, and was unable to
finish it? Where is this goodly tower of a commonwealth, which the
English boasted they would build to overshadow kings, and be another
Rome in the West?… What madness is it for them who might man- age nobly
their own affairs themselves, sluggishly and weakly to</p>
<p>devolve all in a single person!… How unmanly must it needs be,</p>
<p>o count such a one the breath of our nostrils, to hang all our
felicity on him, all our safety, our wellbeing, for which, if we were
aught else but sluggards and babies, we need depend on none but God and
our own counsels, our own active virtue and industry! 97</p>
<p>He predicted that all “the old encroachments” of monarchy on the free
- dom of the people will return soon after restoration. He proposed to
re- place Parliament with a “General Council” of ablest men, elected by
the people, its members to serve till death, subject to removal only by
con- viction of some crime, and replenished by periodical elections.
This Coun- cil, however, is to allow the greatest possible freedom of
speech and worship, and of local autonomy. “I trust,” Milton concluded,
“I shall have spoken persuasion to abundance of sensible and ingenuous
men — to some perhaps whom God may raise of these stones to become
Children of Liberty, and may enable and unite in their noble resolutions
to give a stay to these our ruinous proceedings, and to this general
defection of the un- guided and abused multitude.” 98</p>
<p>Parliament ignored this plea to destroy itself. Attacks on Milton
ap-</p>
<p>peared in print; one pamphlet recommended hanging him. The Council of
State, now royalist, ordered the arrest of Milton’s printer, and
discharged Milton from his post as Latin secretary. Milton replied by
publishing a second and enlarged edition of The Ready and Easy Way
(April, 1660). He warned Parliament that promises now made by Charles II
could easily be broken after the consolidation of the new royal power.
He admitted that the majority of the people desired the restoration of
Charles II, but he urged that the majority had no right to enslave a
minority. “More just it is… if it come to force, that the less number
compel a greater to</p>
<p>return… their liberty than that a greater number… compel a less most
injuriously to be their fellow slaves.” 99 Attacks upon Milton
multiplied; one called upon Charles II, then at Breda, to remember the
insults that Milton, in Eikonoklastes and elsewhere, had heaped upon
Charles I, and suggested that Milton should be joined with the actual
regicides as meriting death. 100</p>
<p>2 34</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>Before this pamphlet could reach Charles, he had already sailed
for</p>
<p>England. On May 7 Milton, having taken leave of his children,
disappeared into hiding with a friend. He was discovered and imprisoned.
For three months his fate hung in the balance of the royalist
Parliament. Many mem- bers argued that he, if anyone, should be hanged.
The general expectation was that he would be; but Marvell, Davenant, and
others pleaded his age and blindness. Parliament contented itself with
ordering that certain of his books, wherever found, should be burned. On
December 15 he was released. He took a house in Holbom, moved into it
with his children, and passed, after eleven turbulent years of prose,
into the second and noblest period of his poetry.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>THE OLD POET: 1660-67</li>
</ol>
<p>He found some solace in playing the organ and singing; he had, Aubrey
tells us, “a delicate, tuneable voice.” 101 In 1661 he moved again, and
again in 1664, this time to his final home on Artillery Walk, where a
private garden allowed him to stroll without other guides than his hands
and feet. His nephews, their beatings forgotten, came often to see and
aid him; friends dropped in to read to him or take his dictation. His
three daughters served him impatiently but arduously. Anne, the oldest,
was lame and deformed, and had a defect of speech. Deborah was his
amanuensis. She and Mary were taught to read to him in Latin, Greek,
Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish, though they could not understand
what they read. 102 Indeed, none of them had ever gone to school; they
had had some private tutoring, but they were poorly educated at best.
Milton sold most of his library before he died, as his children cared
little for books. He complained that they clandestinely sold his books,
that they neglected him in his need, that they conspired with the
servants to rob him in household purchases. 103 They were unhappy in
that somber home, under a stern, demanding, ir- ritable father. When
daughter Mary heard that he was planning another marriage, she said
“that there were no news to hear of his wedding; bur if she could hear
of his death, that were something.” 104 In 1663 Milton, aged fifty-five,
took a third wife, Elizabeth Minshull, aged twenty-four. She served him
faithfully to the end of his days. After seven years with this
stepmother, whom Aubrey describes as “a gentle person, a peaceful and
agreeable humor,” 105 the three daughters left the paternal home and
went out, at Milton’s expense, to learn various trades.</p>
<p>The Restoration had cost him much — almost his life; but it made
Para- dise Lost possible. Without it he might have exhausted himself in
em- battled prose, for the fighter in him was as strong as the poet.
Nevertheless,</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>amid his campaigns, he had never quit hope of writing something that
England would cherish for centuries to come. In 1640 he made a list of
possible subjects for an epic or a drama; the story of Adam’s fall was
in that list, along with the legends of King Arthur. He wavered between
Latin and English as the language he would use; and even when he had
decided on Paradise Lost as his theme, he thought of writing it in the
form of a Greek tragedy or a medieval mystery play. At various times he
com- posed lines or passages which were later fitted into the poem. Not
till Cromwell was dead did Milton have the leisure to work upon the epic
daily; and then (1658) he was altogether blind —</p>
<p>On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;</p>
<p>In darkness, and with dangers compass’d round. 106</p>
<p>Lines came to him as he lay helpless and sleepless in bed; bursting
with them he would call for an amanuensis, saying that he “wanted to be
milked.” 107 A fever of composition would come upon him; he would
dictate forty lines “in a breath,” and then lab oriously correct them as
they were reread to him. Probably no poem was ever written with such
toil and courage. Milton found strength in his consciousness that he was
play- ing both Homer and Isaiah to England, for he believed that the
poet is the voice of God, a prophet divinely inspired to teach
mankind.</p>
<p>In 1665, when plague struck London, an imprisoned Quaker friend,</p>
<p>Thomas Ellwood, arranged that Milton should be guided to Chalfont
St. Giles in Buckinghamshire, and occupy Ellwood’s ten - room “cottage”
there. In this “Pretty Box” the poet completed Paradise Lost (June,
1665). But who would publish it? London was in turmoil in 1665-66, with
fire coming on the heels of plague; and what joy remained was largely
Restoration roistering, in no mood for 10,558 lines on original sin.
Milton had received a thousand pounds for his Pro Populo Anglicano
Defensio; now (April 27,</p>
<ol start="1667" type="1">
<li>he sold all rights to Paradise Lost to Samuel Simmons for five
pounds down and an agreement for additional payments of five pounds
each, contingent on sales; all in all he received eighteen pounds. 108
The poem was published in August, 1667. In its first two years thirteen
hundred copies were sold; in its first eleven years, three thousand.
Probably not that many readers, in any year, read it through today. We
have so little leisure now that we have invented so many labor-saving
devices.</li>

<p>The poem shares with the Aeneid the drawback that it came after</p>
<p>“Homer”; so its battle scenes and supernatural warriors lose force by
being imitations. Doubtless Homer too followed earlier models, but we
have for- gotten them. Johnson thought that Paradise Lost, “by the
nature of its subject, has the advantage, above all others, that it is
universally and perpet-</p>

<p>ually interesting”; but he confessed that “none ever wished it longer
than</p>
<p>Of Man’s First Disobedience, and the Fruit</p>
<p>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste</p>
<p>Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</p>
<p>was timely enough in Milton’s youth, when the Book of Genesis was
received as history, and heaven and hell, angels and devils, were in the
fabric of daily thought. Today the subject is the poem’s greatest
handicap, a fairy tale recited to adults in twelve cantos; and a
sustained effort is now required to accompany from beginning to end so
long an exposition of so harsh and antiquated a theology. But never has
nonsense been made more sublime. The grandeur of the scene, embracing
heaven, hell, and the earth; the solemn, stately march of the blank
verse, the manipulation of the complicated plot, the fresh and tender
descriptions of nature, the success- ful effort to give reality and
character to Adam and Eve, the frequent passages of majestic power —
these are some of the reasons why Paradise Lost remains the greatest
poem in the English language.</p>
<p>The story opens in hell, where Satan, pictured as a bird of
“mighty</p>
<p>stature” and “expanded wings,” exhorts his fall en angels not to
despair:</p>
<p>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</p>
<p>And study of revenge, immortal hate,</p>
<p>And courage never to submit or yield:</p>
<p>… To bow and sue for grace</p>
<p>With suppliant knee, and deify his power</p>
<p>… , that were low indeed,</p>
<p>That were an ignominy and shame beneath</p>
<p>This downfall;…</p>
<p>he mind and spirit remains</p>
<p>Invincible… 110</p>
<p>This sounds like Cromwell defying one Charles, and Milton another.
Sev- eral passages describing Satan remind us of Milton:</p>
<p>A mind not to be changed by place or time.</p>
<p>The mind is its own place, and in itself</p>
<p>Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. 111</p>
<p>In the early cantos Milton’s eloquence lured him into drawing an
almost sympathetic picture of the Devil as the leader of a revolt
against established and arbitrary power. The poet saved himself from
making Satan the hero of the epic by representing him later as the
Father of Lies, who “squat</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>*37</p>
<p>like a toad,” or as a serpent sliding sinuously in the slime. 112 But
in that same canto Satan stands forth as the defender of knowledge:</p>
<p>Knowledge forbidden?</p>
<p>… Why should their Lord</p>
<p>Envy them that? Can it be a sin to know,</p>
<p>Can it be death? And do they [Adam and Eve] only stand</p>
<p>By ignorance? Is that their happy state,</p>
<p>The proof of their obedience and their faith?</p>
<p>… I will excite their minds</p>
<p>With more desire to know… 113</p>
<p>And so he argues with Eve like a rationalist attacking an
obscurantist Church:</p>
<p>Why, then, was this forbid? Why but to awe,</p>
<p>Why but to keep you low and ignorant,</p>
<p>His worshipers? He knows that in the day</p>
<p>You eat thereof, your eyes, that seem so clear</p>
<p>Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then</p>
<p>Open’d and clear’d, and ye shall be as gods… 114</p>
<p>The angel Raphael, however, bids Adam check his curiosity about the
universe; it is not wise for man to desire to know beyond his mortal
scope ; 115 faith is wiser than knowledge.</p>
<p>We should have e xpected Milton to interpret the “first sin” not as
desire for knowledge but as sexual intercourse. On the contrary, he
sings a quite unpuritanic paean to. the legitimacy of sexual pleasure,
within the bounds of marriage; and he represents Adam and Eve as
indulging in such tactile values while still remaining in the “state of
innocence.” 116 But after the</p>
<p>O why did God</p>
<p>… create at last</p>
<p>This novelty on Earth, this fair defect</p>
<p>Of Nature, and not fill the World at once</p>
<p>With men as angels without feminine,</p>
<p>Or find some other way to generate</p>
<p>Mankind ? 118</p>
<p>Whereupon, so soon in the Biblical history of marriage, the first man
makes a plea for the easier divorcing of the wife by the husband.
Almost</p>
<p>2 3 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>forgetting Adam, Milton here repeats in verse what he had said in
prose about the proper subordination of woman to man. 119 He will return
to that refrain in Samson Agonistes ; 120 it is his favorite dream. And
in his secret De Doctrina Christiana he pleaded for the restoration of
polygamy. Had not the Old Testament sanctioned it, and had not the New
Testa- ment left that wholesome and manly law unrepealed? 121</p>
<p>However interpreted, “man’s first disobedience” proved too narrow a
theme to fill twelve cantos. An epic required action, action, and
action; but as the revolt of the angels is over when the story begins,
its drama can enter the poem only through reminiscence, which is a
fading echo. The battle scenes are well described, with due clash of
arms and cleaving of heads and limbs, but it is hard to feel the pain or
ecstasy of such imaginary blows. Like the French dramatists, Milton
indulges a passion for oratory; everyone from God to Eve makes speeches,
and Satan finds hellfire no impediment to rhetoric. It is disturbing to
learn that even in hell we shall have to listen to lectures.</p>
<p>God, in this poem, is not the indescribable effulgence felt in
Dante’s Paradiso; he is a Scholastic philosopher who gives long and
unconvincing reasons why he, the omnipotent, allows Satan to exist, and
allows him to tempt man, all the while foreseeing that man will succumb
and bring all mankind to centuries of sin and misery. He argues that
without freedom to sin there is no virtue, without trial there is no
wisdom; he thinks it better that man should face temptation and resist
it than not be tempted at all, quite unforeseeing that the Lord’s Prayer
would beg God not to lead man into temptation. Who ca n help sympathize
with Satan’s revolt against such an incredible sadist?</p>
<p>Did Milton really believe in this predestinarian horror? Apparently,
for he expounded it not only in Paradise Lost, but in his secret essay
De Doctrina Christiana ; 122 long before the creation of man, God had
de- termined which souls should be saved, and which should be damned.
That secret essay, however, contained some heresies; Milton never
published it; it was not discovered till 1823, and did not reach print
till 1825.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable document. It begins piously enough by
assuming,</p>
<p>without argument, that every word in the Bible was inspired by God.
Milton admits that the Biblical text has suffered from “corruptions,
falsi - fications, and mutations,” but even in its present form it is
the work of God. He will not allow any but a literal interpretation. If
the Scriptures tell us that God rested, or feared, or repented, or was
angry or grieved, these statements are to be taken at their face value,
and not diluted as metaphors. Even the corporeal parts and qualities
ascribed to God are to be accepted as physically true. 123 But in
addition to this external revelation</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>of himself in Scripture, God has given us an internal revelation
which is the Holy Spirit speaking in our hearts; and this internal
revelation, “the peculiar possession of each believer, is far superior…
, a more certain guide than Scripture.” 124 However, in his argume nts,
Milton quotes the Bible as the final and clinching proof.</p>
<p>On the basis of Scripture he rejects orthodox Trinitarianism, and
prefers the Arian heresy: Christ was literally the Son of God, but he
was be- gotten by the Father in time; therefore he was not coeval with
the Father, and never equal with Him. Christ is the agent created by God
as the Logos through whom all else was to be created. Milton does not
admit Creation ex nihilo, out of nothing; the world of matter, like the
world of spirit, is a timeless emanation from the divine substance. Even
spirit is a fine, ethereal matter, and should not be too sharply
distinguished from matter; ultimately matter and spirit, and in man body
and soul, are one. 125 These views bear considerable resemblance to
those of Hobbes (1588-1679) and Spinoza (1632-77), both of whom died in
the same decade with Milton (1608-74). Probably Milton knew the works of
Hobbes, which were making con- siderable noise in the court of Charles
II.</p>
<p>Milton’s personal religion remained a strange mixture of theism and
materialism, of Arminian freedom of will and Calvinistic predestination.
He seems in his writings to have been a profoundly religious man; yet he
attended no church, even before his blindness, and practiced no
religious rites in his home. 126 “In the distribution of his hours,”
wrote Dr. Johnson, “there was no hour of prayer, either solitary or with
his household; omitting public pr ayers, he omitted all.” 127 He scorned
the clergy, and lamented Cromwell’s retention of a state - paid clergy
as a form of “whoredom” injurious to both Church and state. 128 In one
of his last pronouncements ( Treatise of True Religion, Heresy, Schism,
Toleration, and the Best</p>
<p>Means to Prevent the Growth of Popery, 1673) he went directly counter
to Charles II’s second Declaration of Indulgence (1672) by warning Eng -
land not to tolerate Catholics, atheists, or any sect that did not
recognize the Bible as the sole basis of its creed.</p>
<p>It was this man, bristling with heresy, anticlericalism, and
nonconformity, who gave its noblest modern exposition to the Christian
creed.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>THE FINAL YEARS: 1 667-74</li>
</ol>
<p>As he passed into his seventh decade, Milton still retained, except
for his blindness, the physical health and pride that had upheld him
through so many conflicts of religion and politics. Aubrey describes him
as “a spare man… of middle stature,… a beautiful and
well-proportioned</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>body,… complexion exceeding fair;… healthy and free from all
diseases; seldom taking any physic [medicine]; only towards his latter
end he was visited with the gout.” 129 His hair, parted in the middle,
fell to his shoulders in curls; his eyes gave no sign of their
blindness; his gait was still erect and firm. When he went out he
dressed fastidiously and wore a sword, for he was proud of his
swordsmanship. 130 A man made grave and humorless by too much certainty,
yet pleasant enough in conversation if not crossed. He was not quite a
Puritan: he had the Puritan consciousness of sin, hell, election, and
infallible Scripture, but he relished beauty, enjoyed music, wrote a
play, and wanted many wives; some echo of the Elizabethan elan lingered
amid his humorless solemnity. He was egotistic, or revealed his natural
egotism, to an unusual ext reme; he was “not ignorant of his own parts,”
as Anthony Wood put it; 131 and, said Johnson, “scarcely any man ever
wrote so much and praised so few.” 132 Probably genius needs to be
self-centered, buttressed with internal pride, in order to stand
steadily against the crowd. What is hardest to accept in Milton is his
capacity for hatred and his intemperate abuse of those who differed from
him. He thought that we should pray for our enemies, but that we should
also “call down curses publicly on the en emies of God and the Church,
as also on false brethren, and on such as are guilty of any grievous
offenses against God, or even against ourselves.” 188 The other side of
this hot pas - sion was the courage of the prophet denouncing his time.
Instead of being silenced by the Restoration riot, he dared to hit at
the “court amours” under Charles II, the “lust and violence” in palaces,
the “bought smile of harlots,” the “wanton masque or midnight ball.”
134</p>
<p>As if flinging a last defiance at darkened time, he published in one
day (September 20, 1670) two unrelentingly Miltonic works: Paradise Re-
gained and Samson Agonistes. In 1665 Thomas Ellwood, having read the
earlier epic, challenged Milton: “Thou hast said much here of Paradise
lost, but what has t thou to say of Paradise found?” 136 Milton felt the
point keenly, but he wondered how he could show Paradise regained at any
point in history; even the death of Christ had not cleansed man of crime
and lust and war. But he thought that in the resistan ce of Christ to
Satan’s temptations he saw a promise that the God in man would someday
over- come the Devil in him, and make man fit to live under the rule of
Christ and justice on earth.</p>
<p>So in the four “books” of Paradise Regained Milton centered the life
of Christ not on the Crucifixion but on the temptation in the
wilderness. Satan offers Christ “stripling youths… of fairer hue than
Ganymede,” then “nymphs… and Naiades… and ladies of the Hesperides,” 188
then wealth — all to no avail. Satan shows him Imperial Rome under a
Tiberius exhausted, childless, and unpopular; would not Christ like to
lead a revolu- tion with Satan’s aid, and make himself emperor of the
world? As this does</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>2 4 I</p>
<p>not appeal to Jesus, Satan shows him the Athens of Socrates and
Plato; would he not like to join them and be a philosopher? Satan and
Christ then engage in a strange debate on the comparative merits of
Greek versus Hebrew literature, Christ upholds the Jewish prophets and
poets as far superior to the Greeks:</p>
<p>Greece from us these arts derived,</p>
<p>111 imitated.. , 137</p>
<p>After two “books” of argument Satan acknowledges himself defeated and
takes to his wings, while a chorus of angels gathers around the
triumphant Christ and sings:</p>
<p>… now thou hast avenged</p>
<p>Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing</p>
<p>Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise… 138</p>
<p>Milton tells the story not with the sonorous sublimity of the larger
epic, but with his usual facility for verse and predilection for
argument, all the while unfolding his erudition in geography and
history. He does not con- tinue the story to the Crucifixion; probably
he did not agree with the view that it was Christ’s death that reopened
the gates of Paradise. Happi - ness could be gained only by virtue and
self-control. He could never under- stand why England refused to take
seriously this absurd rewriting of the Gospels. He thought the later
epic not inferior to the earlier except in scope. 139 “He could not bear
to hear Paradise Lost preferred to Paradise Regained ?.” 140</p>
<p>The Miltonic fire flared up for the last time in Samson Agonistes.
Having challenged Homer, Virgil, and Dante with his epic, now he
challenged Aeschylus and Sophocles with a play that accepted all the
restraints of Greek tragedy. The preface asks the reader to note that
the drama obeys the classic unities, and that it avoids “the poet’s
error of intermixing comic stuff with tragic sadness and gravity, or
introducing trivial and vulgar persons”; here Milton turns his back upon
the Elizabethans, and cleaves to the Greeks; nor does he fall far short
of his Attic exemplars. Samson, his strength shorn with his hair by
Delilah, and his eyes gouged out by his Philistine captors, does not
merely echo Oedipus eyeless in Colonus; he is Milton himself, living in
a world hostile and unseen:</p>
<p>Blind among enemies, O worse than chains,</p>
<p>Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age!</p>
<p>Light, the prime work of God, to me is extinct,</p>
<p>And all her various objects of delight</p>
<p>Annulled, which might in part my grief have eased…</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. VIII</p>
<p>O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,</p>
<p>Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse</p>
<p>Without all hope of day! 141</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole play may be interpreted as a remarkably consistent
allegory: Milton is Samson, agonizing in adversity; the defeated Jews
are the Puritans, the chosen people, broken by the Restoration; the
victorious Philistines are the triumphant pagan royalists, and the
collapse of their temple is almost a prophecy of the “Glorious
Revolution” that unseated the “idolatrous” Stuarts in 1688. Delilah is a
treacherous Mary Powell, and the chorus repeats Milton’s arguments for
divorce. 142 Milton almost purged himself of his furies by voicing them
through Samson, who accepts his coming end:</p>
<p>My race of glory run, and race of shame,</p>
<p>And I shall shortly be with them that rest. 143</p>
<p>In July, 1674, Milton felt himself failing. For reasons not known to
us he omitted writing his will; instead, he delivered to his brother
Christopher a “nuncupative” — merely oral — will, which Christopher
reported as fol- lows:</p>
<p>Brother, the portion due to me from Mr. Powell, my former wife’s</p>
<p>father, I leave to the unkind children I had by her; but I have
received no part of it; and my will and meaning is they shall have no
other</p>
<p>benefit of my estate than the said portion and what I have besides
done for them, they having been very undutiful to me. And all the
residue of my estate I leave to the disposal of Elizabeth, my loving
wife. 144</p>
<p>This oral will was repeated to his wife and to others at various
times.</p>
<p>He held on to life resolutely, but day to day his gout increased in
pain, crippling his hands and feet. On November 8, 1674, fever consumed
him, and that night he died. He had lived sixty-five years and eleven
months. He was buried in the cemetery of his parish church, St. Giles,
Cripplegate, beside his father.</p>
<p>Oral wills were recognized in English law till 1677, but were subject
to close scrutiny by the courts. The daughters c ontested Milton’s will;
the judge rejected it, gave two thirds to the wife, one third, totaling
three hundred pounds, to the daughters. The “portion due” from
Mr. Powell was never paid.</p>
<p>Though we know so much more about Milton than about Shakespeare, and
so much must be recorded to picture him, we still do not know</p>
<p>enough to judge him — if this is possible of any man. We do not know
how</p>
<p>CHAP. VIIl)</p>
<p>MILTON</p>
<p>H3</p>
<p>much reason his daughters gave him for his resentment, nor how they
treated that third wife who so comforted his old age; we can only regret
that he failed to win their love. We do not know in full his reasons for
acting as a censor of the press for Cromwell after arguing so eloquently
for “unlicensed printing.” We may ascribe much of his abusiveness in
controversy to the manners and standards of the time. We may pardon his
vanity and egotism as the crutch on which genius leans when it gets
little support from the applause of the world. We need not relish him as
a man to admire him as a poet, and as one of England’s greatest writers
of prose.</p>
<p>Those who resolve to read Paradise Lost from beginning to end are</p>
<p>surprised to find how often it soars to high levels of imagination
and utter- ance, so that in time we forgive the dull pages of argument,
science, or geography as breathing spaces between exaltations; it would
be absurd to expect those lyric flights to be continuously sustained. In
the short poems they are sustained. And in Milton’s prose there are
passages, especially in the Areopagitica, that are unsurpassed for vigor
or splendor, for thought and music, in all the gamut of the world’s
secular literature.</p>
<p>His contemporaries gave him only a grudging fame. During the ascend-
ancy of his party he was a warrior writing prose, and his early lyrics
were forgotten. He published his larger poems under that Restoration
which scorned his tribe and reluctantly consented to let him live. When
Louis XIV asked his ambassador in London to name England’s best
living</p>
<p>authors, the reply was that there were none of any worth except
Milton, who, unfortunately, had defended the regicides who were now
being hanged, alive or dead. Even in that riotous age, however, its most
famous poet, John Dryden, whom Milton had reckoned as “a good rhymester
but no poet,” 145 rated Paradise Lost as “one of the greatest, most
noble and most sublime poems which either this age or nation has
produced.” 146 After the overthrow of the Stuarts Milton came into his
own. Addison praised him generously in The Spectator. 1 * 1 Thereafter
the image of Milton grew in splendor and sanctity in the British mind,
till Wordsworth, in 1802, could apostrophize him:</p>
<p>Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour;…</p>
<p>Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart;</p>
<p>Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea,</p>
<p>Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free.</p>
<p>His soul was like a monument, and dwelt apart even from those nearest
to him; but his mind spread like the majestic heavens over all the
concerns of men, and his voice still sounds like Homer’s polyphloisboio
thalasses, the “many - billowed sea.”</p>
