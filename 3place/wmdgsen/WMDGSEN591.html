<h4 id="chapter-xxi">CHAPTER XXI</h4>
<p>Imperial Armageddon</p>
<p>1564-1648</p>
<p>I. THE EMPERORS</p>
<p>I N 1564 the Holy Roman Empire, though, as Voltaire said, it was none
of these, was an imposing motley of semi-independent states: Germany,
Luxembourg, Franche-Comte, Lorraine, Switzerland, Austria, Bohemia,
Moravia, and part of Hungary. All these acknowledged as their head
Emperor Maximilian II of the ancient house of Hapsburg, which had ruled
the Empire since 1438 and would continue to rule it tUl 1808. After the
abdication of Charles V (1555-56) the family divided half of Europe</p>
<p>between its two branches: the Austrian Hapsburgs reigned over the
Empire, the Spanish Hapsburgs reigned over Spain and its dependencies.
Rarely in history has one family held power so long over so many men.
The rule of the Hapsburgs was more liberal in the Empire than in</p>
<p>Spain, because the constituent states differed so widely in
government, economy, language, religion, and ethnic character that even
Hapsburg power and prestige could not keep these centrifugal forces from
making the Empire a loose association of proudly self-governed units.
The Imperial Diet, meeting occasionally, found it easier to check the
authority of the emperor than to make laws that would be accepted by all
the states; and the seven Imperial electors who chose the emperor
controlled him by the pledges exacted from him as the price of his
election. These electors were the king of Bohemia, the rulers of Saxony,
Brandenburg, and the Palatinate, and the “spiritual electors” — ^the
archbishops of Cologne, Trier, and Mainz. The emperor ruled directly
only Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Camiola, and the Tirol, at times also
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and western Hungary. His independent revenues
were from these lands; for anything more he had to come hat in hand to
the Imperial Diet, which held the power of the purse.</p>
<p>When Ferdmand I (brother of Charles V) died in 1564, the electors</p>
<p>transmitted the Imperial crown to his son Maximilian II, who had
already received the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary. He was too lovable
to be an emperor. Everyone basked in the sunshine of his good nature and
good humor, his kindness and courtesy to all classes, his open mind and
heart; add his intelligence and toleration, his encouragement of
science, music, and</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>art, and a picture emerges of a gentleman incredibly crowned. He had
endangered his accession by preferring Lutheran to Catholic preachers,
and insisting on wine as well as bread in receiving the Sacrament; and
only when he had to choose between returning to the Roman Church and re-
tiring to private life did he conform, outwardly, to the Catholic
observance. Meanwhile he protected the Protestants from persecution. He
condemned the Massacre of St. Bartholomew as mass murder,^ and allowed
William of Orange to levy troops in Germany to fight Alva in the
Netherlands. In an age of intolerance and war he gave to the states and
creeds of the Empire a remarkable example of toleration without
indifference and of peace without cowardice. On his deathbed (1576) he
refused to receive the last rites from the Church of Rome, but all the
Empire joined in</p>
<p>blessing his memory.</p>
<p>He had persuaded the electors to accept his son Rudolf as his
successor, though he must have seen in him some traits of character, or
effects of education, dangerous to religious concord. Rudolf II was by
temperament suspicious and somber. As a possible heir to Philip II he
had been sent to Spain for part of his schooling, and the Jesuits there
had disabled him for toleration. Soon after his accession he severely
restricted the freedom and the area of Protestant worship, alleging,
with some reason,® that the violence of religious controversy and the
mutual intolerance of the</p>
<p>Protestant sects were undermining the peace and stability of the
Empire. But he was not entirely wanting in the qualities that had made
his father loved. He lived in a modest simplicity, assuming no imperial
airs. When one of his brothers condemned his familiarity with people of
humble station, he replied, “Though elevated above others by our dignity
and birth, we ought not to forget that we are allied to the rest of
mankind by our weak- nesses and defects.”®</p>
<p>Indeed, he preferred to be a savant rather than an emperor. He
learned half a dozen languages, practiced almost every science and art,
made valuable collections of pictures and statuary, botanical varieties
and zoo- logical specimens. He helped poets and historians, and founded
many schools. He became proficient in mathematics, physics, chemistry,
astron- omy, and medicine, but also in alchemy and astrology; he
financed the astronomic researches of Tycho Brahe and Kepler, who
dedicated to him their Rudolphine tables of the stars. Absorbed in
science in his palace at Prague — which he made his capital — he found
no time for marriage, and not much for government. After 1594 he
attended no meeting of the Diet; after 1 598 he refused to sign official
papers and delegated his authority to incompetent favorites. As his
years mounted his mind deteriorated, not into insanity, but into a
brooding, melancholy isolation haunted by fear of assassination. He had
dreamed — or Tycho Brahe had read in the stars^ —</p>
<p>540</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>that his murderer would be a monk; so he came to distrust all
Catholic ec- clesiastics, and especially the Jesuits.® Under compulsions
internal and external, he resigned to his younger brother Matthias in
1608 the govern- ment of Austria, Himgary, and Moravia, and in 161 1 the
throne of Bohemia and all his remaining powers. In 1612 he died.</p>
<p>Matthias was already fifty-five, too wearied with campaigns to enjoy
active rule. He entrusted both administration and policy to Melchior
Klesl, the able and conscientious Bishop of Vienna. Klesl offended the
Catholics by concessions to the Protestants, and offended the
Protestants by conced- ing too little. Matthias’ co usin Ferdinand,
Archduke of Styria, imprisoned Klesl (1618), and secured his own
election to the Imperial authority soon after Matthias’ death (1619). By
that time Armageddon had begun.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE EMPIRE</li>
</ol>
<p>Switzerland was only formally a part of the Empire; lusty
victories</p>
<p>against the emperors and the archdukes had left the cantons free to
quarrel among themselves. Savoy and Spain joined the Catholic cantons,
led by Lucerne, in diplomatic or martial efforts to recover the
Protestant cantons for the Roman Church. The Jesuits, from their college
at Lucerne, began in 1577 a resolute campaign of education, preaching,
and intrigue. Papal nuncios in Switzerland reformed abuses in the
Catholic clergy, ended cleri- cal concubinage, and stemmed the
Protestant influences that were spread- ing from Zurich, Geneva, and
Bern.</p>
<p>Geneva was slowly recovering from Calvin. Theodore de B^e suc-</p>
<p>ceeded his master (1564) as head of the Venerable Company (of
pastors) and the Consistory (of pastors and laymen), and through them he
carried on the work of the Reformed Church with tact and courtesy that
only the odium theologicum could disrupt. He traveled into France to
attend Calvinistic synods, and we have seen him presenting the case for
Protestant- ism in the Colloquy of Poissy. At home he strove, not quite
successfully, to maintain the austere morality that Calvin had imposed.
As business leaders diverged more and more from that code, Beze led the
clergy in denouncing usury, monopoly, and profiteering; and when the
city council suggested that preachers confine themselves to religion,
Beze argued that nothing human should be alien to religious control.® He
was the only one of the great Reformation leaders to survive into the
seventeenth cen- tury, dying in 1608 at the age of eighty-nine.</p>
<p>Austria’s role in the Empire was central. It was usually the home of
the emperors; it was the bulwark of Western civilization against the
ambitious</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON 541</p>
<p>Turks; it was a bastion of the Counter Reformation, and the seat
of</p>
<p>Catholic power in the Thirty Years’ War. And yet it had for a
time</p>
<p>wavered between Catholicism and Protestantism, even between
Christianity and unbelief. During the reign of Ferdinand I (1556-64) the
Lutheran catechism was adopted in most Austrian parishes; Lutheranism
prevailed in the University of Vienna; the Austrian Diet allowed
Communion in both kinds and the marriage of the clergy. “It was
considered a sign o f an enlightened mind to despise Christian
interment, and to be buried with- out the assistance of a priest . , .
and without a cross.” A preacher reckoned in 1567, “Thousands and tens
of thousands in the towns — yea, even in the villages — no longer b
elieve in God.”^ Fearing the collapse of religious support to the
Austrian government and the Hapsburg power. Emperor Ferdinand summoned
Peter Canisius and other Jesuits to the University of Vienna. Under
their lead Catholicism began to recover ground, for these trained men
combined patient subtlety of intellect with an impressive simplicity of
life. By 1598 the Roman Church was again predominant.</p>
<p>A like transformation came over Christian Hungary. Two thirds of</p>
<p>Hungary had been under Turkish rule since 1526; the Turkish frontier
was less than a hundred miles from Vienna, and peace with Turkey was
preserved only by an annual tribute paid till 1606 by the emperors to
the sultans. Transylvania, lying northeast of Turkish Hungary, paid
similar tribute, but in 1606 its prince, Stephen Bocskay, dying
childless, bequeathed the province to the Hapsburgs.</p>
<p>The Diet of Austrian Hungary, controlled by nobles eager to
appropriate Catholic Church property,® had since 1526 favored the
Reformation. Under the religious freedom that they maintained,
Protestantism won ascendancy among the literate classes. Soon it divided
into Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Unitarianism, and the Unitarians
divided into smaller sects over the propriety of addressing prayers to
Christ. The nobles, now secure in their appropriations, saw no further
reason for Protestantism. They welcomed Peter Pazmany and other Jesuits,
accepted exemplary conversion, expelled Protestant pastors,® and
replaced them with Catholic priests. In 1618 Arch- duke Ferdinand of
Styria became King of Hungary, and actively furthered the Counter
Reformation. In the Diet of 1625 the Catholics regained the majority.
Pazmany, son of a Calvinist, became a cardinal and one of the most
eloquent Hungarian authors of the age.</p>
<p>Bohemia and its dependencies — Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia — ^were
in 1560 predominantly Protestant. All four states acknowledged the king
of Bohemia as their sovereign, but each had its own national assembly,
laws, and capital — Prague, Briinn (Brno), Breslau, Bautzen. Prague
was</p>
<p>542 THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>already one of the most flourishing and picturesque cities in Europe.
In the Bohemian Diet only the 1,400 landed proprietors could vote, but
its membership included burgher and peasant representatives whose
control of the purse gave them an influence beyond words. Most of the
nobles were Lutherans; most of the burghers were Lutherans or
Calvinists; most of the peasants were Catholics, but a minority were
“Utraquists” who in 1587 re - nounced their Hussite traditions, insisted
only on receiving the Sacrament in both kinds, and finally (1593) made
their peace with the Roman Church. Most sincere of the religious groups
was the Unitas Fratrum — ^the Bo- hemian or Moravian Brethren — ^who
took the Sermon on the Mount seriously, shunned all modes of life but
agriculture, and lived in peaceful Tolstoyan simplicity.</p>
<p>In 1555 Ferdinand I brought the Jesuits into Bohemia. They
established a college at Prague, brought up a cadre of fervent
Catholics, and won over many nobles who had married Catholic wives.^®
Rudolf II issued edicts banishing first the Bohemian Brethren, then the
Calvinists, but he lacked the means to enforce these decrees. In 1609
the Protestants prevailed upon him to sign a famous Majestdtsbrief, or
Royal Charter, guaranteeing the freedom of Protestant worship in
Bohemia. Two years later Rudolf</p>
<p>yielded the crown to Matthias, who removed the Imperial capital to
Vienna, leaving Prague offended and rebellious. In 1617 the Bohemian
Diet, increasingly Catholic though the country was still predominantly
Protestant,^^ acknowledged as king of Bohemia Archduke Ferdinand of
Styria, who had been educated by the Jesuits and had vowed to eradicate
Protestantism wherever he ruled. The Bohemian Protestants prepared for
war.</p>
<p>Germany was a confusion within a complexity: not a nation but a name,
a medley of principalities agreeing in language and economy, but
jealously diverging in customs, government, currencies, and creeds.*
Each of these units acknowledged no superior except the emperor, and
ignored him fifty weeks in the year. Some foreigners found consolation
in this division of Germany; “If it were entirely subject to one
monarchy,” wrote Sir</p>
<ul>
<li>In the sixteenth century Germany was divided into seven

<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>Thomas Overbury in 1609, “it would be terrible to all the rest” of
Europe.^*</p>
<p>Despite this kaleidoscope of great towns and petty courts, Germany no
longer enjoyed the economic ascendancy that she had held in northern
Europe before Luther. The discovery of an all- water route from Western
Europe to India, and the opening of the Atlantic to trade, had benefited
first Portugal and Spain, then England and the Netherlands; they had in-
jured Italy, which had formerly dominated trade with the East; and</p>
<p>the German rivers and towns that had carried commerce from Italy to
the north shared in the Italian decline. On the North Sea the ports of
the Netherlands, on the Baltic those of Denmark and Poland, took most of
the trade and the fees. The Hanseatic League had long since lost its old
ascendancy. Liibeck was ruined in its long war with Sweden (1563-70).
Only Frankfurt am Main retained its prosperity; its annual fair con-</p>
<p>tinued to be the best-attended in Europe, and made the city the
center of Germany’s domestic trade and international finance.</p>
<p>Money was as popular as ever. Edicts forbidding interest rates above
5 per cent were evaded everywhere. “The godless vice of usury,” said a
priest in 1585, “is practiced more zealously now by the Christians than
formerly by the Jews.” An “unchristian love of gold,” complained a</p>
<p>preacher in 1581, “has seized upon everybody and all classes. Whoever
has anything to stake, instead of engaging in honest and strenuous work
. . . thinks to grow rich … by all sorts of speculation, money dealing,
and usurious contracts.”^® Hundreds of working people invested their
savings with the Fuggers, the Welsers, or the Hochstetters, and were
wiped out in repeated bankruptcies. In 1572 the banking firm of Loitz
Brothers went bankrupt after gathering great sums from simple investors,
who now lost their savings, even their homes. The Fuggers were ruined by
the bank- ruptcies of Philip II and Alva, whom they had helped to
finance.^® The Welsers failed in 1614, owing 586,000 gulden. Perhaps
fear of inflation had driven people into such investments, for nearly
every German prince stole from his people by debasing the currency, and
counterfeiters and coin clippers abounded. By 1600 all German currencies
were in a disgraceful chaos.</p>
<p>Population rose while production lagged, and misery verged on rev-
olution. In all but Saxony and Bavaria the peasants were driven into</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>serfdom. In Pomerania, Brandenburg, Schleswig, Holstein, and Mecklen-
burg serfdom was established by law in or soon after i6i6.*® “In what
German land,” asked a writer in 1598, “does the German peasant still
enjoy his old rights.^ Where does he have any use or profit of the
common fields, meadows, or forests? Where is there any limit to the
number of feudal services or dues? Where has the peasant his own
tribunal? God have pity on him!”^^ Many peasants went to work in the
bowels of the earth, but the profits and real wages of mining declined
as American silver entered Germany to compete with metal laboriously
extracted from ex- hausted lodes. In the towns the old guild comradeship
gave place to the exploitation of journeymen (day laborers) by masters.
In some industries the working day began at 4 a.m. and ended at 7 p.m.,
with “breaks for beer”; the braziers’ guild exacted a ninety -two-hour
week in 1573.^® As early as 1579 we hear of strikes against textile
machinery in Germany.^® Only war was needed to make destitution
unparalleled.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>MORALS AND MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>If we believe the moralists of this half century before the war,
the</p>
<p>moral picture was as dark as the economic. Teachers complained that
the youngsters sent to them were not Christians but barbarians. “The
people bring up their children so badly,” wrote Matthias Bredenbach in
1557, “that it becomes obvious to the poor schoolmasters . . . that they
have got to reckon . . . with wild ani mals.”®® “All discipline appears
at an end,” said another in 1561; “the students are refractory and
insolent in the extreme.”®^ In most university towns the citizens
hesitated to go out at night for fear of the students, who on some
occasions attacked them with open knives.®® “A chief cause of the
general depravity of the students,” said Nathan Chy transin in 1578, “is
undoubtedly the decline in home train - ing. . . . Now that we have
slipped the yoke of ancient laws and statutes from off our necks … it is
no wonder that we find, among the larger part of our young people, such
unbridled licentiousness, such boorish ignorance, such ungovernable
insolence, such terrible godlessness.”®® Others thought that “not the
least among the causes why the you ng lapse into immorality and
lasciviousness are the comedies, spectacles, and plays.”®^</p>
<p>As for adults, the preachers described them as quarrelsome
hypocrites, gluttons, drunkards, and adulterers.®® Pastor Johann Kuno
complained in 1579, “Vice of all sorts is now so common that it is
committed without shame, nay, people even boast of it in sodomitish
fashion; the coarsest, the most indecent sins have become virtues. . . .
Who regards common whore- dom any longer as a sin?”®* Pasto r
Bartholomaus Ringwalt thought in 1585 that those were “the last and
worst times which have come upon the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>world.”®^ Profanity was almost universal among the men, regardless of
creed.^® Calumny had a festiva l. “My superintendent,” wrote the Count
of Oldenburg in 1 594, “has complained to me of the manner in which
Dr. Pezel, at Bremen, has abused and slandered him in one of his books,
making out that he spent his days in gluttony, drunkenness and
debauchery, that he . . . was a sheep-devouring wolf, a serpent, a
he-goat, an abortion, . . . and that he must be gotten rid of either by
hanging, drowning, or im- prisonment, by the wheel or by the sword.” The
court preacher of the Elector of Saxony found that “almost throughout
the length and breadth of Germany it has been falsely reported that I
earn large gilded goblets in drinking matches, that … I so fill myself
with wine that … I have to be propped up and laid on a wagon and carted
off like a drunken calf or sow.”®*</p>
<p>Eating and drinking were major industries. Half the day of a
well-to-do German was consumed in passing edibles from one end of his
anatomy to the other. Burghers were proud of their appetites, which,
like the dress of their women, served as heralds of their prosperity. A
circus performer earned national fame by eating at one meal a pound of
cheese, thirty eggs, and a large loaf of bread — after which stint he
fell dead. Dinners lasting seven hours, with fourteen toasts, were not
unusual. Weddings were in many cases riots of gourmandizing and
intoxication. A jovial prince signed his letters ^^Valete et
inebriamini’’’ (Be well and get drunk). Elector Chris- tian II of Saxony
drank himself to death at the age of twenty-seven. A temperance society
struggled against the evil, but its first president died of drink.®® It
was asserted that gluttony was shortening the tenure of life. Said
Erasmus Winter in 1 599: “Owing to immo derate eating and drinking there
are now few old people, and we seldom see a man of thirty or forty who
is not affected by some sort of disease, either stone, gout, cough, con-
sumption, or what not.”®^</p>
<p>We must not take these contemporary complaints too seriously. Prob-
ably the majority of the people were hard-working, long-suffering, and
literally God-fearing folk; but in history, as in journalism, virtue
makes no news — ^which proves it usual. The wives of the burghers lived
in a modest domestic privacy, absorbed in a hundred duties that left no
time for greater sins than gossip; and many women of the upper classes,
like Anna, wife of Elector Augustus I of Saxony, were models of
conscien- tious devotion to their families. There were some pleasant
aspects in that turbulent Germany: love of children and home, generous
hospitality, gay dancing and good music, jolly games and festivals. The
first Christmas tree in recorded history was part of a celebration in
Germany in 1605; it was the Germans who surrounded the Feast of the
Nativity with pic- turesque relics of their pagan past.</p>
<p>Dances and folk songs were begetting forms of instrumental music.</p>
<p>54&lt;5 the age of reason begins (chap. XXI</p>
<p>and hymns were growing Into massive chorales. Organs became monu-
ments of architecture; harpsichords, lutes, and other instruments were
themselves products of loving art; hymnbooks, especially in Bohemia,
were sometimes gorgeously adorned. Protestant hymns were often didactic
or polemical, sacrificing the tenderness of medieval sacred song, but
the Protestant chorales were already pointing to Johann Sebastian Bach.
Musi- cal instruction was compulsory in the schools of all the creeds;
the “cantor” — ^i.e., the professor of music — ^ranked only after the
rector or principal in the scholastic hierarchy. Organists were as
famous then as pianists now; Jakob Handl held high repute in Prague, and
the Hassler brothers — Hans, Kaspar, and Jakob — thrilled congregations,
often with their own compositions, in Dresden, Nuremberg, and Prague.
Musical ability tended to run in families, not through any mystical
heredity, but through the contagion of the home; so a veritable host of
Schultzes took the name Praetorius. Michael Praetorius composed not only
tomes of music, but also, in his Syntagma musicum (1615-20), a thorough
and scholarly ency- clopedia of musical history, instruments, and
forms.</p>
<p>The great name in this age and field was Heinrich Schiitz,
unanimously honored as the father of modem German music. Born to a Saxon
family in 1585, exactly a century before Bach and Handel, he established
the musical forms and spirit that these men brought to perfection. At
twenty- four he went to Venice, where he studied under Giovanni
Gabrieli. Re- turning to Germany, he hesitated between music and law,
but finally settled down as director of music at the Dresden court of
John George, Elector of Saxony. From 1618 onward he poured forth choral
composi- tions which, in their manipulation and contrast of choirs, solo
voices, and instruments, fully prepared for the many Bachs. Now for the
first time heavy German choral counterpoint was fused and lightened with
the more melodious “concerted” style, which combined voices and
instruments. To celebrate the marriage of the Elector’s daughter (1627),
Schiitz com - posed the first German opera, Dajne, based upon Peri’s
opera of the same name performed in Florence thirty-three years before.
A second trip to Italy influenced Schiitz to give further prominence to
solos and instru- ments in his Symphoniae sacrae (1629), setting to
music Latin texts from the Psalms and the Song of Songs. In 1631 Saxony
became an active theater of war, and Schiitz wandered from court to
court, even to Denmark, seeking choirs and bread; not till 1645 was he
re-established in Dresden. In that year he created the style of German
Passion music with an oratorio. The Seven Words jrom the Cross-, here he
set the example of giving the words of a single character to the same
single voice, and of preceding or following the voice with the same
strains in the instruments; Bach adopted this method in The St. Matthew
Passion. Again opening up new paths.</p>

<p>Schiitz published in 1657 Deutsche Concerten — cantatas that place
him with Carissimi as joint founder of the dramatic oratorio. His
Christmas Oratorio (1664) set another mark for Bach to aim at. A year
later he reached his zenith with The Passion and Death of Our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, sternly scored for voices alone and unrelieved
with arias. Soon thereafter he lost his hearing. He retired to the
sohtude of his home, and died at eighty-seven after putting to music a
passage from the 1 19th Psalm: “Thy statutes have been my songs in the
house of my pilgrimage.”</p>

<p>The outstanding literary productions of the Empire in this age
were</p>
<p>the translation of the Bible by the Bohemian Brethren (1588), and the
Hungarian epic 7 ,rinyiasz (1644), by Miklos Zrinyi. Germany, and par-
ticularly Frankfurt am Main, now (c. 1600) succeeded Italy as the busi-
est publisher of books. The Frankfurt book fair began in 1598 to issue
semiannually a catalogue of publications. Literary societies encouraged
poetry and drama, but literature was stifled by civil and ecclesiastical
censorship. Lutheran, Calvinist, and CathoUc leaders agreed that works
considered injurious to the government, the official faith, or public
morals should be forbidden; and, strange to say, the total number of
books pro- hibited by Protestant authorities exceeded the total of those
condemned by the Roman Church.®^</p>
<p>Scholarship declined as controversy mangled truth. Matthias Flacius
lUyricus and his aides compiled in thirteen folio volumes a history of
the Christian church; but The Magdeburg Centuries, as their Historia
eccle- siae Christi (1559-74) came to be called from its place of
composition and its division by centuries, was as one-sided as the
Catholic histories of that age, when every book was a weapon; so Gregory
VII, to these cen- turions , was “the most monstrous of all monsters
born,” who had com - passed the death of several popes before mounting
the “Chair of Pesti - lence.”®® The finest German historiography of its
time was Johannes Sleidanus’ story of the Reformation, De statu religi
onis et reipublicae Carolo V Caesar e (1555), so impartial that not even
Melanchthon could forgive him.</p>
<p>Next to invective, the most popular literary form was the drama. Both
Protestants and Catholics used the stage for propaganda; Protestant
plays made much fun of the pope, and usually ended by conducting him to
hell. The Catholic cantors of Switzerland produced Passion, Easter, and
Last Judgment plays from 1549, in one case with 290 actors. The Passion
Play of Oberammergau was first presented in 1614 as the fulfillment of a
vow</p>

<p>during the plague of 1633, and was repeated every tenth year, lasting
from 8:30 A-M. to 6 p.m., with a two-hour intermission at midday.
Italian actors entered Germany in 1568, and were followed by Dutch,
French, and English. These troupes soon replaced private with
professional per- formances, and they evoked many complaints by their
remunerative ob- scenity.</p>
<p>Even more popular was the virile and versatile Alsatian satirist
Johann Fischart. Falling gaily into the spirit of the age, he issued a
series of anti- Catholic travesties so cleverly devastating that he was
soon the most widely read writer in Germany. His Bienenkorb des heiligen
roimschen Irmnens- scfywarms (1579) attacked with passionate caricature
the history, doctrine, ceremonies, and clergy of the Church; all
Catholic convents were hot- houses of debauchery and abortion; the
Church had decreed that priests “might have free use of other people’s
wives”; six thousand infant heads had been found in a pond near a
nunnery; and so on.®^ Another satire, Jesuitenhiitlein, ridiculed the
four-cornered hat of the Jesuits and de- nounced all their ways and
ideas. In 1575, under a rollicking eight-line title, Fischart published
a pretended translation, actually an imitation and proliferation, of
Rabelais’ Gargantua -, here he derided all aspects of German life — the
oppression of the poor, the maltreatment of pupils, the gluttony and
drunkenness, the fornication and adultery — ^in a jumble of style and
Alsatian dialect, seasoned with obscenity and wit. Fischart died at
forty- three, having exhausted his vocabulary.</p>
<p>Almost as lively, and dying in the same year, 1590, at the same
age,</p>
<p>Nikodemus Frischlin ran through a dozen lives in one. At twenty he
was professor of history and poetry at Tubingen; he wrote Latin verse
with quasi-Horatian finesse, and scholarly commentaries on Virgil. At
thirty- five he was dismissed for satirizing the nobility. Thereafter he
lived with rollicking recklessness; he drank heavily, for wine, he said,
was necessary to genius, and the verses of teetotalers were worthlessly
watery; he was accused of ruining one girl and poisoning another;
threatened with crim- inal prosecution for immorality, he fled from city
to city; he dedicated a published lecture to eleven different notables,
geographically distributed to provide him asylum anywhere; but he died
from a fall when he had still not fully expressed his opinion of his
enemies. They called him, in the manner of the time, “a stinking, mangy
poet … a lying, roguish abortion of the Devil”;®® but he was the best
poet that Germany could produce in that unhappy age.</p>
<p>Art suffered from the Protestant aversion to images, the decline of
the Church as patron, the corruption of native styles by uncongenial
Italian influence, the deterioration of taste by coarse morals and

<p>versy, and, later, the consuming fire of war. The marvel of it is
that despite these discouragements German craftsmanship produced, in the
six decades before the war, several lordly palaces and stately town
halls, a good painter, and some precious minor art. The collections of
Emperor Rudolf II and Duke Albert V of Bavaria formed the nuclei of the
famous Alte Pinakothek of Munich. Albert himself was a German Medici,
making his court a haven for artists, beautifying his capital with
architecture, and gathering sculpture into the imposing Antiquarium* —
^the first museum of ancient statuary north of the Alps.</p>
<p>In 1611-19 ^ Dutch architect buUt for Duke Maximilian I at Munich</p>
<p>the Residenz,* which for centuries served as the home of Bavaria’s
dukes, electors, and kings. Gustavus Adolphus lamented that he could not
re- move to Stockholm this favorite example of the German late
Renaissance. The Jesuits, in their own ornate version of baroque, raised
fine churches at Coblenz and Dillingen, and the mass ive Hofkirche
(St. Michael’s)* in Munich. In a plainer and statelier style Santino
Solari designed the Salz- burg cathedral just a few years before the
outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
<p>As the princes had appropriated most ecclesiastical wealth in
Protestant Germany, architecture there ceased to be ecclesiastical and
became civic, sometimes palatial. Immense castles were built: the
Schloss Heiligenberg at Baden, famous for the ceiling of carved linden
wood in its Rittersaal, or Hall of Knights; Aschaffenburg Castle* on the
Main; Heidelberg</p>
<p>Castle, still one of the major sights of Germany. A sumptuous
Rathaus, or town hall, rose to house municipal administration in
Liibeck,* Pader- born,* Bremen, Rothenburg, Augsburg,* Nuremberg,* Graz.
The textile merchants of Augsburg engaged the city’s leading architect,
Elias Holl, to build their Zeughaus, or Cloth Hall. Bremen provided a
Kornhaus and Frankfurt a Salzhaus for dealers in grain and salt
respectively; but who would have expected vinegar to enshrine itself so
tastefully as in Bremen’s Essighaus?</p>
<p>Now, and in the next 150 years, palaces rose everywhere in Germany to
shelter the triumphant princes in gay and curlicued baroque. The
Margrave of Ansbach-Bayreuth spent 237,000 florins (0,000,000?) on his
Plassenburg Palace, in one of the poorest principalities in the Empire.
In better taste was the electoral palace provided for the archbishops of
Mainz. The domestic architecture of the period appears fascinatingly
pic- turesque in tradition and illustration, but an angry physician
described German houses in 1610 as composed of dark, smelly, filthy
rooms seldom breathing fresh air.®® Nevertheless the interior of the

<p>was the real home of Germany’s minor arts, rich with adornments made
by skilled handicraft: carved panels and ceilings, strong furniture
carved and inlaid, railings of wrought iron, locks and bars cast in
grandiose forms, figurines of ivory, goblets of silver or gold. The
German burgher never had enough of decoration in his home.</p>
<p>Engraving, especially on copper, flourished in Germany even through
the wars. Lukas Kalian and his brother Wolfgang began, about 1600, a
remarkable dynasty of engravers which continued through the seven-
teenth century with Wolfgang’s sons P hilipp and Bartholomaus, and with
Philipp’s great -grandsons till 1781. German sculpture, however,
suffered from attempts to imitate classic forms alien to the German mold
and mood. When native carvers let themselves go they turned out
first-class work, like the central and side altars cut in wood by Hans
Degler for the Ulrichs - kirche in Augsburg, or the seventy figures
carved by Michael Honel for the cathedral of Gurk in Austria. A special
feature of the age was the wonderful fountains, inspired by Italian
exemplars: the Wittelsbacher Fountain before the Residenz at Munich, and
the Tugendbrunnen, or Fountain of Virtue, before the Lorenzkirche in
Nuremberg.</p>
<p>When Rubens heard that Adam Elsheimer had just died (1610) at</p>
<p>thirty- two, he said, “Such a loss should plunge all our profession
into deep mourning. It will not be easy to replace him, and in my
opinion he can never be equaled in 〔painting〕 small figures,
landscapes, and many other things.”®^ Born in Frankfurt, Ad am left for
Italy at twenty and, after a stay in Venice, spent the rest of his life
in Rome. Rubens prayed God “to pardon Adam his sin of laziness,” but we
do not know if it was laziness that made Elsheimer confine his work to
small paintings on copper plates. It could hardly be laziness that made
him give to his landscapes such minute finish as in TAe Flight into
Egypt,^^ or such unique representa- tions of light and air as made him,
on his modest scale, a Rembrandt before Rembrandt. He seems to have been
well paid for his work, but not suffi- ciently to meet his needs and
tastes. He became bankrupt, was imprisoned for debt, and died shortly
after his release.</p>
<p>Painting on glass was a favorite art in this age, first at Zurich and
Basel, then in Munich, Augsburg, and Nuremberg; windows in convents and
homes became as colorful as in a medieval church. The carving of glass
appeared early in the seventeenth century in Nuremberg and Prague. The
Hirschvogel family in Nuremberg was famous for artistic glass and</p>
<p>pottery. Cologne and Siegburg warmed the German heart with stone jugs
and mugs elegantly carved, and stoves were often housed in color- glazed
earthenware. In the working of wood, ivory, iron, gems, and</p>
<p>precious metals, the Germans were unsurpassed. Cabinetmakers were so
highly esteemed that when one of them was condemned to be hanged for</p>

<p>theft he was pardoned because he was so good an “art carpenter.” The
iron railing around the tomb of Emperor Maximilian I at Innsbruck is
superb. Anton Eisenhut executed in 1588 liturgical vessels in such
delicately designed and richly embellished silver that they still stand
at the top of their kind. German goldsmiths were sought for everywhere,
and their products readily found a European market. Drinking cups,
goblets, and jugs of silver were made in a hundred humorous forms;
Germans could drink themselves tipsy out of windmills, lanterns, apples,
monkeys, horses, pigs, monks, and nuns. Even in their cups they waged
the theological war.</p>
<p>V. THE HOSTILE CREEDS</p>
<p>The Diet of Augsburg (1555) had brought the religious strife to a</p>
<p>geographical truce on the principle Cuius repo eius religio, “Whose
re - gion, his religi on” — ^i.e., in each state the religion of the
ruler was to be made the religion of his subjects; dissidents were to
leave. The agreement represented a mite of progress, since it
substituted emigration for execu- tion; but it was restricted to
Lutheranism and Catholicism, and the painful uprooting of many families
added to the chaos and bitterness in Germany. When a ruler of one creed
was succeeded by another of another, the population was expected to
change its faith accordingly. Religion became the tool and victim of
politics and war.</p>
<p>So divided in theology, Germany before the Thirty Years’ War pre
-</p>
<p>sented no simple religious map. By and large the north was
Protestant, the south and the Rhineland were Catholic; but, as the
Augsburg principle could not be thoroughly or hastily enforced, there
were many Protestants in Catholic areas and many Catholics in Protestant
lands. The Catholics had the advantages of tradition and unity; the
Protestants enjoyed more liberty of belief, and they divided into
Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, and Unitarians; even among the
Lutherans there was a war of creeds be- tween the followers and the
opponents of the liberal Melanchthon. In 1577 the Lutherans formulated
their faith in the Book of Concord, and thereafter Calvinists were
expelled from Lutheran states. In the Palatinate, Elector Frederick III
favored Calvinism and made the University of Heidel- berg a seminary for
Calvinist youth. There, in 1563, Calvinist theologians drew up the
Heidelberg Catechism, which shocked both Catholics and Lutherans by
rejecting the Real Presence of Christ in the wine and bread of the
Eucharist. Catholics were tolerated in the Palatinate if they con- fined
their worship to their homes; Unitarians were forcibly suppressed. In
1570 two men who questioned or limited the divinity of Christ were put
to death at the insistence of Calvinist professors in the University
of</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>Heidelberg. Frederick’s son, Elector Lewis, preferred and enforced Lu
- theranism; Lewis’ brother John Casimir, as regent (1583 -92),
preferred and enforced Calvinism; and Elector Frederick IV (1592-1610)
confirmed that policy. His son Frederick V (1610-23) married Elizabeth
Stuart</p>
<p>(daughter of James I of England), claimed the throne of Bohemia, and
precipitated the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
<p>The struggle between Lutherans and Calvinists was as bitter as
between Protestants and Catholics, and it damaged Protestant
co-operation during the war, for each alternation of roles between
persecutors and persecuted left a heritage of hate. In 1585 Count
Wolfgang of Isenburg-Ronneburg removed all Lutheran functionaries in his
territory and installed Calvinists in their place; in 1 598 his brother
and successor. Count Henry, informed the Calvinist preachers that they
must leave within a few weeks, despite wintry weather; in 1601 Count
Wolfgang Ernest succeeded to the govern- ment, expelled the Lutheran
preachers, and restored Calvinism. Similar replacements of Lutherans
with Calvinists occurred in Anhalt (1595), Hanau (1596), and Lippe
(1600). In East Prussia Johann Funck, accused of Calvinist leanings, was
put to death in the market place of Konigsberg amid popular rejoicing
(1566).®® Chancellor Nikolas Krell was beheaded at Dresden (1601) for
altering the Lutheran ritual in a Calvinist direction and for supporting
French Huguenots.^® In 1604 Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Cassel adopted
Calvinism; in 1605 he enforced it there and in Upper Hesse; his troops
beat back a resisting crowd of Lutherans and tore down the religious
images in the churches; preachers unwilling to change from Lutheranism
to Calvinism were banished.^^ In the Electorate of Branden- burg
Lutherans and Calvinists disputed violently as to whether the con-
secrated Host was really Christ; finally the government decreed
Calvinism to be the true religion (i6i3f).^®</p>
<p>Amid these fluctuations of truth what Melanchthon had called rabies
theologorum raged as seldom before or after in history. The Lutheran
pastor Nivander (1582) listed forty characteristics of wolves and showed
that these were precisely the distinctive marks of Calvinists. He
described the dreadful deaths of leading anti-Lutherans; Zwingli, he
said, having fallen in battle, “was cut into straps, and the soldiers
used his fat — ^for he was a corpulent man — ^to grease their boots and
shoes. Said a Lutheran pamphlet of 1590: “If anyb ody wishes to be told,
in a few words, con- cerning which articles of the faith we are fighting
with the diabolical Calvinistic brood of vipers, the answer is, all and
every one of them . . . for they are no Christians, but only baptized
Jews and Mohamm edans.”^* At Frankfurt fair, wrote Stanislaus Rescius
(1592), “we have noticed for several years past that the books written
by Protestants against Protestants are three times as numerous as those
of Protestants against Catholics.”*®</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>“These raging theologians,” mourned a Protestant writer in i6io,
“have so greatly aggravated and augmented the disastrous strife among
the Christians who have seceded from the papacy, that there seems no
hope of all this screaming, slandering, abusing, damning,
anathematizing, etc., coming to an end before the advent of the Last
Day.”^®</p>
<p>To understand this “theological rabies” we must remember that all</p>
<p>parties to the dispute agreed that the Bible was the infallible word
of God, and that life after death should be the main concern of life.
And the pic- ture must find room for the real piety that humbled and
exalted many Lutherans, Calvinists, and Catholics behind the delirium of
the faiths. The Pietists fled from the hustings of theology and sought
in privacy some reassuring presence of divinity. Johann Arndt’s Paradis
gartlein {Little Garden of Paradise) is still read in Protestant Germany
as a manual of devout contemplation. Jakob Bohme carried the mood into a
mystical union of the individual soul with a God conceived as the
Universal Well and Ground of all things, containing all contradictions,
all “evil” as well as “good.” Bohme claimed to have seen the “Being of
all Beings, the God, the Abyss, also the birth of the Holy Trinity. A
mind unsympathetic</p>
<p>to mysticism will find only a whirlwind of absurdities in Bohme’s De
signatura rerum {On the Siptature of All Things, 1621); it is consoling
to discover that another mystic, John Wesley, described it as “sublime
nonsense.”®® Better were the simple and sensuous hymns of the Jesuit k
Pietist Friedrich von Spee.</p>
<p>As everywhere in Europe, it was the Jesuits who led the Catholic</p>
<p>crusade to recover lost terrain. They began by seeking to reform the
Catholic clergy. “Pray God,” wrote the Jesuit Peter Faber from Worms in
1540, “that in this city there are even two or three priests who have
not formed illicit liaisons or are not living other known sins.”®® But
the main strategy was to capture the young; so the Jesuits opened
colleges at Cologne, Trier, Coblenz, Mainz, Speyer, Dillingen, Munster,
Wurzburg, Ingolstadt, Paderbom, Freiburg. Peter Canisius, head and soul
of this Jesuit campaign, traversed nearly all Germany on foot, spawning
colleges, directing Jesuit polemics, and explaining to German rulers the
advantages of the old faith. He urged Duke Albert V to root out by force
all</p>
<p>Protestantism from Bavaria.®® Through the Jesuits, the Capuchins, the
reformation of the clergy, the zeal of bishops, and the diplomacy of
popes and nuncios, half the ground won by German Protestantism in the
first half of the sixteenth cenmry was regained for the Church in the
second half. Some forms of coercion were used here and there, but the
move- ment was largely psychological and political; the masses were
tired of uncertainty, controversy, and predestination; their rulers saw
in a unified and traditional Catholicism a stronger support of .
government and social</p>
<p>554</p>

<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>order than in a Protestantism chaotically divided and precariously
new.</p>
<p>Realizing at last that their internal divisions were suicidal, the
Protestants turned their pulpits and their pens against the Roman foe. A
war of words and ink prepared for the war of guns and blood, and mutual
vituperation mounted to an almost homicidal ecstasy. Words like dung,
offal, ass, swine, whore, murderer entered the terminology of theology.
The Catholic writer Johann Nas in 1565 accused the Lutherans of
practicing “mur der, robbery, lying, deceit, gluttony, drunkenness,
incest, and villainy without fear, for faith alone, they say, justifies
everything”; and he thought it likely that every Lutheran woman was a
prostitute.®^ Catholics took the damnation of Protestants as an axiom of
theology; but the Lutheran preacher Andreas Lang wrote (1576) with equal
certainty, “Papists, like other Turks, Jews, and heathen, are outside
the pale of God’s grace, of forgiveness of sins, and of salvation; they
are destined to howl, lament, and gnash their teeth everlastingly in the
burning fire and brimstone of the flames of hell.”®^ Writers on both
sides told scandalous tales of each</p>
<p>Popess Joanna was popular in Protestant literature. “People could see
and know,” wrote a clergyman in 1589, “what double -dyed knaves and vil-
lains the Jesuiwiders were 〔who〕 obstinately persisted in denying that
the English whore Agnes had been popess at Rome and had given birth to a
boy during a public procession.”®® The popes, said a sermon (1589), had
always been, and still were, without a single exception, sodomites,
necromancers, and magicians; many of them had been able to spit hellfire
out of their mouths. “Satan often a ppeared visibly to the popes . . .
and Joined with them in cursing and trampling the cross of Christ
underfoot, and held naked dances over it, which they called divine
service.”®^ Con - gregations drank in such intoxicants eagerly.
“Children in the streets,” said a Protestant clergyman in 1 584, “have
learned to curse and mark the Roman Antichrist and his damned
crew.”®®</p>
<p>The Jesuits were favorite targets. In hundreds of caricatures,
pamphlets, books, poems, they were accused of pederasty, adultery, and
bestiality. A German woodcut of 1569 (still preserved in the Goethe
collection at Weimar) showed the pope, in the form of a sow, giving
birth to Jesuits in the form of little pigs. In 1593 the Lutheran
theologian Polycarp Leiser published a Latin Historia Jesuitici ordinis,
which described the Jesuits as practicing the most obscene vices with
full license and pardon from the pope.®® Eine wahrhaftige neue Zeitung
(A Truthful New Journal, 1614) informed its readers that the Jesuit
Cardinal Bellarmine had committed adultery 2,236 times with 1,642 women,
and it went on to describe the agonizing death of the Cardinal, who was
not yet dead by seven years.®^ The Jesuits at first replied with
restraint. Canisius advised temperate</p>

<p>555</p>
<p>language; so did the Protestant pastor Johann Mathesius; but the
public preferred vituperation to moderation. Protestant polemists
accused the Jesuits of accepting the doctrine of the Jesuit Mariana
defending tyran- nicide; a German Jesuit replied that this was precisely
the doctrine that ought to be applied to princes who forced
Protestantism upon their sub- jects; but other Jesuits assured the
Protestant rulers that they were con- sidered legitimate princes, and
that not a hair of their heads would be hurt.®® The Jesuit Conrad Vetter
published (1594-99) pamphlets in</p>
<p>which he used the grossest terms of abuse, excusing himself on the
ground that he was following the lead of Lutheran divines; these
pamphlets were bought by the public as fast as they could be printed.
The Jesuits of</p>
<p>Cologne declared that “the stubborn heretics who spread dissension
every - where” in Catholic territory</p>
<p>ought to be punished as thieves, robbers, and murderers are punished;
indeed, more severely than such criminals, for the latter only
injure</p>
<p>the body, while the former plunge souls into everlasting
perdition.</p>
<p>… If forty years ago Luther had been executed, or burned at the
stake, or if certain persons had been put out of the world, we should
not have been subjected to such abominable dissensions, or to those
multi-</p>
<p>tudes of sects who upset the whole world.®*</p>
<p>In the same spirit the Calvinist David Parens, professor of theology
at Heidelberg, summoned (1618) all Protestant princes to a crusade
against the papacy; in this enterprise they should “stop at no kind of
severity or punishment.”®* The barrage of pamphlets culminated with
1,800 publica - tions in the one year 1618, the first year of the
war.</p>
<p>As the power and the temper of the Catholics rose, a number of</p>
<p>Protestant princes formed a Union of Evangelical Estates (1608),
or</p>
<p>Protestant Union, for mutual protection. The Elector of Saxony held
aloof, but Henry IV of France seemed ready to help in any enterprise
against the Hapsburg Emperor. In 1609 several Catholic rulers, led by
Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria, formed a Catholic Union, which came to be
known as the Catholic League; by August 16 lo nearly all the Catholic
states of the Empire had joined, and Spain offered military aid. The</p>
<p>Protestant Union agreed (February 1610) to help Henry IV take posses-
sion of the duchy of Jiilich-Cleves, but the assassination of the French
King (May 14) left the Protestants shorn of their strongest ally. Fear
ran through Protestant Germany, but the League was not ready for action.
In January 1615 Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Cassel warned the Protestant
Union that “the Catholic League, protected by the pope, the king of</p>
<p>Spain, the court of Brussels, and the emperor, . . . had ordered its

<p>gion.”®^ Caspar Scioppius added to the excitement by warning the
Catholics and the Lutherans (i6i6) that the Calvinists “intended to
overthrow the Religious and Public Peace, and the whole of the Holy
Roman Empire, and to eradicate the Augsburg Confession, as well as the
Catholic faith, from the Empire”;*^ perhaps this was an attempt to
further divide the main Protestant bodies. Territorial conflicts between
Austria and Bavaria weakened the Catholic League in i6i6, and men again
dreamed of peace.</p>
<p>But in Prague Count Heinrich von Thurn pleaded with the Protestant
leaders to prevent the ardently Catholic Archduke Ferdinand from taking
the throne of Bohemia. Emperor Matthias had left five deputy governors
to administer the country during his absence. The governors overruled
the Protestants in disputes about church building at Klostergrab, and
sent the objectors to jail. On May 23, 1618, Thurn led a crowd of irate
Protestants into Hradschin Castle, climbed to the rooms where two of the
governors sat, and threw them out the window, along with a pleading
secretary. All three fell fifty feet, but they landed in a heap of filth
and escaped more soiled than injured. That famous “defenestration” was a
dramatic chal - lenge to the Emperor, to the Archduke, and to the
Catholic League. Thurn expelled the Archbishop and the Jesuits and
formed a revolutionary Di- rectory. He could hardly have realized that
he had let loose the dogs of war.</p>

<p>Matthias sent to the Directory an offer of amnesty and negotiation;
it was refused.®® Archduke Ferdinand, ignoring the Emperor, dispatched
two armies to invade Bohemia. Frederick V, Elector of the Palatinate,
persuaded Charles Emmanuel, the anti-Hapsburg Duke of Savoy, to send to
Bohemia’s aid a force led by an able condottiere, Peter Ernst von Mans -
feld; Mansfeld captured Pilsen, the stronghold of the Catholics in
Bohemia; Ferdinand’s armies retreated. Christian of Brunswick,
Frederick’s Chancel - lor, suggested to the directors that they would
strengthen their defense and better exclude Ferdinand from the throne if
they offered it to Frederick. On March 20, 1619, Matthias died, leaving
Ferdinand the legal King of Bohemia and heir presumptive to the Imperial
crown. On August 19 the Bohemian Diet declared Ferdinand deposed as its
king; on the twenty- seventh it proclaimed Frederick of the Palatinate
King of Bohemia; on the twenty-eighth the Imperial electors made the
Archduke of Styria the Emperor Ferdinand II.</p>

<p>Frederick hesitated to accept his new honors. He knew that, as a
leading Calvinist, he could not count on Lutheran support, while against
him would be the Empire, the papacy, and Spain. He appealed to his
father-in- law, James I of England, for an army; instead, the canny King
sent him good advice — ^to reject the Bohemian throne. Frederick’s gay
and spirited wife, Elizabeth, did not urge him to accept, but she
promised to share with good cheer whatever fate his choice should bring;
and this promise she kept. Christian of Brunswick counseled acceptance.
On October 31, 1619, the new King and Queen entered Prague and were
enthusiastically welcomed by the Diet and the populace.</p>
<p>Frederick was still a youth of twenty, of fine character and
chivalrous disposition, but too immature for statesmanship. One of his
first actions after being installed in Prague was to order the removal
of all altars and images from the national sanctuary, the Church of
St. Vitus, and soon his followers similarly denuded other Bohemian
shrines. The Catholic minority denounced the procedure, the Bohemian
Lutherans frowned upon it; Lutheran Germany looked coldly on this
enthusiastic Calvinist. On April 30, 1620, Ferdinand proclaimed
Frederick a usurper and ordered him to leave the Empire by June i; if he
failed to do so he would be declared an outlaw and his property would be
confiscated. The Emperor offered to guarantee the Protestant states of
Germany freedom from attack if they would give the Catholic states a
similar pledge; in the Treaty of Ulm (June 3, 1620) this offer was
accepted. The Protestant princes argued that Frederick had endangered
their liberties by defying Ferdinand. Elector John George of Saxony
aligned his Lutheran state with the Catholic</p>
<p>Emperor.</p>
<p>In August an Imperial army of 25,000 men crossed from Austria into
Bohemia under Maximilian of Bavaria’s general, Johan Tserclaes, Count of
Tilly, who had learned his piety from the Jesuits and the art of war
from the Duke of Parma. Near the White Mountain, west of Prague, this
army met and routed the Bohemians (November 8). Frederick, Eliza- beth,
and their entourage fled to Silesia. Failing to raise an army there, the
King and Queen dismissed their followers and sought refuge in Cal-
vinist Brandenburg. On the day after the battle Maximilian of Bavaria
occupied Prague. Soon Catholicism was restored; images were replaced in
the churches; the Jesuits were called in; all education was put under
Catholic control; no religion was to be allowed except Catholicism and
Judaism. Communion in wine as well as bread was abolished; John Huss’s
Day, formerly a national festival, was made a day of mourning, with all
churches closed. Thirty leading rebels were arrested; twenty-seven were
executed; and for ten years twelve severed skulls grinned from the tower
of the Charles Bridge over the Moldau.®* All rebels were forbidden
to</p>
<p>558</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>emigrate. Their property was forfeited to King Ferdinand, who sold it
at bargain prices to Catholics; a new Catholic nobility was established,
on the basis of peasant serfdom. The middle and commercial classes
almost disappeared.</p>
<p>While Maximilian of Bavaria was thus refuting Calvinism in Bohemia,
Spinola, during the truce in the Netherlands, led a large force from</p>
<p>Flanders to capture the Palatinate. Some minor Protestant princes
raised a force to oppose him, and Frederick, leaving his wife in The
Hague, joined their camp. When Spinola was recalled to the Netherlands
by the renewal of the Dutch war with Spain, Tilly replaced him, defeated
the Protestants (1622), and captured and pillaged Heidelberg. The great
library of the university was packed into fifty wagons and transported
to Rome as a gift from Maximilian of Bavaria to Gregory XV. Maximilian,
returning in triumph from Bohemia, was given the Palatinate and its
electoral privilege in return for his services to the Emperor. Catholic
states now had a majority in the Electoral Diet.</p>
<p>The scope and thoroughness of the Catholic victory disturbed Catholic
as well as Protestant potentates. The increased prestige and power of
Ferdinand II threatened the “liberties” of the German princes;
Maximilian was disturbed to find that he was permitted to hold the
Palatinate and Bavaria only as dependencies of the Emperor. Pope Urban
VIII sym- pathized with the French view that the Hapsburgs were becoming
too strong for the good of France and the freedom of the papacy, and he
winked at Richelieu’s taxing of French Catholics to help German Prot -
estants — and later a Swedish king — ^against a Catholic Emperor. In
1624 the amazing Cardinal suddenly transformed the political scene with
a succession of diplomatic strokes. On June 10 he signed an alliance
with the Protestant Dutch against Catholic Flanders and Spain; on June
15 he brought Protestant England into the bond; on July 9, Sweden and
Den- mark; on July 1 1 he persuaded Savoy and Venice to join him in an
attempt to cut the Spanish-Austrian line of supplies and reinforcements
through the Valtelline passes in the Italian-Swiss Alps. In 1625
Christian IV of Denmark brought 20,000 men to join Mansf eld’ s 4,000 in
Lower Saxony. Alarmed, Maximilian urged the Emperor to send aid to
Tilly, whose</p>
<p>18,000 troops had been reduced to 10,000 by weather, hunger, and
disease. Ferdinand responded by summoning Wallenstein from Bohemia.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Wallenstein: 1623-30</li>
</ol>
<p>His real name was Albrecht von Waldstein, and he regularly signed</p>
<p>himself so.®® His family was one of the oldest in the Bohemian
nobility. Born in 1583, he was educated first by the Bohemian Brethren,
then by</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>

<p>559</p>
<p>the Jesuits; he married a rich widow, who soon died, leaving him her
fortune. He multiplied it by buying, at prices made nominal by the
depre- ciation of the Bohemian currency, sixty-eight estates confiscated
by Ferdi- nand. He was an intelligent and progressive landlord; he
improved agri- cultural methods and production, financed industry,
organized schools, medical services, and poor relief, and laid up
surpluses to feed his people in time of famine. He impressed his
contemporaries not only by his mili- tary genius, but by his tall, thin
figure, his pale, stem face, his nervous restlessness, his pride and
arrogance, his hot commanding temper. His “immutable chastity”®* made
him seem superhuman. His confidence in astrology was more active than
his faith in Christ.</p>
<p>He had endeared himself to Ferdinand by supporting him at every stage
in the Archduke’s rise to power; and from 1619 onward he lent the</p>
<p>Emperor great sums that almost financed the throne — for example,
200,- 000 gulden in 1621, 500,000 in 1623. He exacted no security for
these loans; it was enough that he owned a fourth of Bohemia, could
raise an army at will, and could lead it with superlative skill. When,
in 1624, the Valtelline passes had fallen under French- Venetian
control, and Spanish soldiers and supplies could no longer go from Italy
to Austria, Wallen- stein offered to mobilize 50,000 men and put them at
the service of the Emperor. Ferdinand hesitated, knowing Wallenstein’s
love of power; but Tilly, in 1625, cried out for reinforcements.
Ferdinand commissioned Wallenstein to mobilize 20,000 men. With
startling speed this new army marched into Lower Saxony, well equipped,
well disciplined, idolizing its commander, and feeding itself by
ravaging the countryside.</p>
<p>Wallenstein repulsed Mansfeld at Dessau, and Tilly defeated Christian
IV at Lutter (1626). Mansfeld died, and Christian found his diminishing
army helpless and mutinous. The great alliance formed by Richelieu had
fallen apart throu gh Gustavus Adolphus’ jealousy of Christian IV,
through England’s declaration of war upon France, and Buckingham’s
expedition to aid the Huguenots at La Rochelle; Richelieu had to
withdraw his forces from the Valtelline passes, which were again open to
Austria and Spain. Wallenstein, his army growing with each day, marched
into Brandenburg and forced its Elector George William to declare for
the Emperor. He pushed on into Christian’s own duchy of Holstein, easily
overcoming all resistance. By the end of 1627 all the mainland of
Denmark was in his power.</p>
<p>The salt air of the Baltic inflated Wallenstein’s plans. Now that

<p>of the North Sea and its trade, or to close the Channel to Spain.
Imperial possession of the Palatinate gave the Emperor control of the
Rhine; so the Dutch would be blocked on river and sea; their power,
their wealth, their obstinate revolution would collapse. Gustavus
Adolphus would be shut up in the Scandinavian peninsula. Already in 1627
Wallenstein was</p>
<p>styling himself Admiral of the Oceanic and Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The German princes were not quite happy over his victories. They</p>
<p>noted that whereas the army of the Catholic League, under Maximilian
of Bavaria and the Count of Tilly, was now fallen to some 20,000 men,
Wallenstein commanded 140,000 troops, and acknowledged responsibility
only to the Emperor. So long as the Emperor had this army behind him, he
could make short work of the princely “liberties.” Indeed, Wallenstein
was probably nursing the idea of ending feudal sovereignties and uniting
all Germany into one powerful state, as Richelieu was doing in France
and as Bismarck was to do in Germany 240 years later.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1627-28 the Imperial electors, meeting at Miil-
hausen, debated their hopes and fears. The Catholic electors were
inclined to support Wallenstein, trusting that he would eradicate
Protestantism from the land of its birth. But when Ferdinand deposed the
Protestant Duke of Mecklenburg and transferred the duchy to Wallenstein
(March II, 1628), even the Catholic princes were al armed by the
Emperor’s</p>
<p>assumption of power to depose and appoint dukes by his sole will. The
electors had one card to play against Ferdinand. He was about to ask
them to name his son King of Rome — ^i.e., to guarantee the son’s
succession to the Imperial throne. On March 28 they notified the Emperor
that while his armies continued under Wallenstein’s command they would
not guar - antee the succession. And Maximilian of Bavaria warned him
that the general’s army and power, if not soon reduced, would di ctate
Imperial policy.</p>
<p>As if to point this warning, Wallenstein, apparently on his own
authority, began secret negotiations with Christian IV, culminating in
the Peace of Liibeck (May 22, 1629). To the surprise of Europe he
restored to the Danish King Jutland, Schleswig, and the royal portion of
Holstein,</p>
<p>exacted no indemnity, but merely required the cession of Christian’s
German sees and military authority. What had motivated this generosity?
Partly fear of a Western coalition against Imperial control of the
Baltic and the straits; partly the belief that Gustavus Adolphus was
planning to invade Germany. In the end, Wallenstein foresaw, the issue
would be be- tween himself and Gustavus, not Christian.</p>
<p>Ferdinand may have been disturbed by his ge neral’s assumption of</p>
<p>diplomatic authority, but his rising suspicions and jealousy had to
be con- cealed, for he was now planning the boldest move of his career,
and would</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON 561</p>
<p>need the support of Wallenstein’s troops at every stage of the
perilous game. His Jesuit advisers had long been pleading with him to
take advan- tage of his new power, and by Imperial edict to restore to
the Catholic Church as much as possible of the property and revenues
that had been taken from her since the outbreak of the Reformation, or
at least since</p>
<ol start="1552" type="1">
<li>Ferdinand, strongly Catholic, saw some justice in the plea, but
underestimated its practical difficulties. Since 1552 many properties
orig- inally belonging to the Church had been bought and paid for by
their present possessors. To effect the restitution thousands of
proprietors would have to be dispossessed, presumably by force, and the
consequent chaos might throw all Germany into revolution. Maximilian of
Bavaria had once favored the idea; now he was appalled by its scope and
implications, and he urged the Emperor to defer it until a Diet could
give it careful con- sideration. Ferdinand feared that the Diet would
reject it. On March 6, 1629, he promulgated his Edict of Restitution.
“There remains nothing for us,” it said, “but to uphold the injured
party, and to send forth our commissioners that they may demand from the
present unauthorized pos- sessors the restitution of all archbishoprics,
bishoprics, prelacies, monas- teries, and other ecclesiastical property
confiscated since the Treaty of Passau” (1552). This was the Counter
Reformation with a vengeance. It was also an assertion of absolute
Imperial power, such as even Charles V might have hesitated to
assume.</li>
</ol>
<p>The edict was met with widespread and passionate protests, but it was
enforced. Whenever resistance was attempted Wallenstein’s soldiers were
called in, and opposition collapsed everywhere except at Magdeburg,
which successfully withstood Wallenstein’s siege. Entire cities —
^Augsburg, Rothenburg, Dortmund — and thirty towns passed into Catholic
hands; so did five bishoprics and a hundred monasteries. Hundreds of
Catholic parishes were reconstituted. As the principle Cuius regio eius
religio was applied by the new owners, requiring the subjects to accept
the religion of the ruler, thousands of Protestants were compelled to
apostatize or emi- grate; from Augsburg alone eight thousand went into
exile, including the Elias Holl who had just completed its stately town
hall. Exiled Protestant pastors wandered about the country begging for
bread; the Catholic priests who had replaced them petitioned the
government to give them relief.” Only the coming of Gustavus Adolphus
prevented the final suc - cess of the edict, and of the Counter
Reformation in Germany.</p>
<p>Having used Wallenstein’s army to enforce the edict, and finding no
Protestant armies in the field, Ferdinand was no longer obstinate about
retaining him. In May 1630 he asked the general to release 30,000 of his
men for service in Italy. Wallenstein objected, urging that the King of
Sweden was planning to invade the Empire; he was overruled, and the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>5 ^^</p>
<p>30,000 men were taken. In July the electors again proposed the
removal of Wallenstein. The Emperor agreed, and on September 13 he
notified the officers of the army that their general had been replaced
in supreme command by Maximilian of Bavaria. Wallenstein retired
peacefully to his estates in Bohemia, knowing that Gustavus had landed
on German soil and that the Empire would soon need a general again.</p>
<p>3 . Gustavus’ Saga: 1630-^2</p>
<p>We must not picture the great King as a Galahad going forth to save
the true religion from idolaters. His task was to preserve and
strengthen Sweden in political independence and economic development;
for these ends he fought against Catholic Poland, Orthodox Russia,
Protestant Den- mark; if now he dared to match his modest resources
against Empire, papacy and Spain combined, it was not because these were
Catholic, but because they threatened to make his country the vassal of
alien and hostile potentates. He felt that the best defense against such
a threat was to estab- lish Swedish bastions on the mainland. Protestant
Saxony hesitated, and Catholic France was led to ally itself with
Gustavus, because they knew that the issue was no theorem in theology
but a struggle for security through power. Nevertheless religion, though
a minor motive among the leaders, was a passionate stimulus among the
people, and its energy had to be added to patriotism to lift the
populace to martial holocausts.</p>
<p>So Gustavus, disembarking his 1 3,000 troops in Pomerania, offered
him- self to the north-German states as the savior of Protestantism, and
to France as a sword against the swelling Hapsburgs. He waited for
reinforcements from Sweden, Scotland, Brandenburg, and Poland, till he
had some 40,000 men, well disciplined, armed with the new-style
flintlock (not the old matchlock) muskets, and trained to move swiftly
with their light artillery. The commander was still young, only
thirty-six, but despite his campaigns he had grown stout, and was a
problem to his horses as well as to his enemies. Nevertheless he was too
often in front of the fray, confidently following his golden beard to
victory. His soldiers loved him not because he was lenient, but because
he was just. While German armies were fol- lowed by flocks of
prostitutes so numerous that special officers were ap- pointed to keep
them in order, Gustavus allowed no courtesan in his camp, though wives
were allowed to serve their soldier husbands.*® Every morn- ing and
evening each regiment attended prayer, and every Sunday it heard a
sermon; here was the discipline of Cromwell’s Ironsides a deca de before
Cromwell’s wars. Like Cromwell, Gustavus forbade forcible conversions;
wherever he conquered he left religion free.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) IMPERIALARMAGEDDON 563</p>
<p>He spent the remainder of 1630 in spreading his control through</p>
<p>Pomerania and seeking allies. If he could associate in one crusade
all the foes of the Hapsburgs, he might have an army of 100,000 men, fit
to face Wallenstein’s. On January 13, 1631, France and Sweden signed a
bond by which the King would find the men, and the Cardinal would supply
400,- 000 thalers (,000,000?) annually, for a five-year campaign;
neither power was to make peace without the consent of the other, and
Gustavus bound himself not to interfere with the exercise of the
Catholic religion. Riche- lieu invited Maximilian to join this alliance;
instead, the Duke-Elector sent Tilly to check the Swedish advance. Tilly
took Neubrandenburg (March 19, 1631), and slaughtered the garrison of
3,000 men. Gustavus took Frankfurt an der Oder (April 13), and
slaughtered the garrison of 2,000 men. While the King spent time in
efforts to add John George of Saxony to his alliance, Tilly and Count zu
Pappenheim besieged Magdeburg, which was still resisting the Edict of
Restitution. On May 20, after holding out for six months, the city was
taken; the victorious troops ran riot in four days of pillage; in the
greatest shambles of the war 20,000 persons were slain — not only the
garrison of 3,000 men, but 17,000 of the 36,000 in- habitants; and all
of the city but the cathedral was burned to the ground. A contemporary
writer described the scene: •</p>
<p>Then was there naught but beating and burning, plundering, tor-</p>
<p>ture, and murder. Most especially was everyone of the enemy bent</p>
<p>on securing much booty. . . . What with blows and threats of
shooting, stabbing, or hanging, the poor people were so terrified that
if they had had anything left they would have brought it forth if it had
been . . . hidden away in a thousand castles. In this frenzied rage the
great and splendid city that had stood like a fair princess in the land
was now</p>
<p>. . . given over to the flames, and thousands of innocent men, women,
and children, in the midst of a horrible din of heart-rending
shrieks</p>
<p>and cries, were tortured and put to death in so cruel and shameful a
manner that no words would suffice to describe, nor tears to bewail
it.69</p>
<p>Tilly, now an old man of seventy-one, did what he could to stop
the</p>
<p>massacre; he rightly predicted that the Protestant states would
“without doubt be only strengthened in their hatred” by this destruction
of one of their fairest cities.</p>
<p>On July 22, 1631, the Elector of Brandenburg placed all his resources
at Gustavus’ disposal; on April 30 John George allied Saxony with
Sweden; and on September 17 the combined Swedish and Saxon armies over-
whelmed the outnumbered forces of Tilly at Breitenfeld, near Leipzig.
This was the first substantial Protestant victory in the war; it revived
the</p>
<p>564</p>
<p>THE AGE OF REASON BEGINS</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>spirit of the Protestant population; and the figure of the Swedish
King, fighting without armor in the thick of that battle, covered with
dust and sweat but guiding and leading his men fearlessly, became a
heartening symbol to a people so recently divided, defenseless, and
cowed by the army of Wallenstein. Mecklenburg was recaptured, and the
deposed Duke was restored. One state after another entered the Swedish
alliance; soon Gustavus controlled a line stretching across Germany from
the Oder to the Rhine. He took up his headquarters at Mainz, in the
heart of a region normally Catholic. In November John George marched his
Saxon army, unresisted, into Prague, carefully sparing Wallenstein’s
estates on the way. Ferdinand, left with no ally but impoverished Spain
and no general</p>
<p>except the aged Tilly, turned humbly to Wallenstein (December 1631),
and asked him to raise an army for the rescue of Bohemia and the protec-
tion of Austria. The proud general agreed, but on extraordinary terms:
he was to have supreme command of all Imperial forces; he was to have
authority to negotiate and sign treaties, except with Adolphus; in lands
conquered by him he was to have the right of confiscation and pardon. In
April 1632 all these conditions were granted. Wallenstein collected an
army and the funds to finance it, offered John George a separate peace,
and recaptured Prague without a shot. The Saxon army retreated into
Saxony.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gustavus took the field and defeated Tilly at Rain
(April</p>
<p>15); Tilly died a fortnight later of his wounds, and Gustavus
occupied Munich. Wallenstein marched out of Bohemia and joined his army
with Maximilian’s. Gustavus was now greatly outnumbered in men; his
allies, suspecting him of Imperial ambitions, were restless and
unreliable; his troops, beginning to starve, were pillaging and
alienating Protestants as well as Catholics. John George, in his cups,
revealed his anxiety to rid himself of the Swedish King. Gustavus had
hoped to capture Vienna, but now, fearing that John George would join
Wallenstein, he turned north. At Nuremberg, conscious that the tide was
running against him, he sent final instructions to Oxenstierna for
carrying on the Swedish government and the war. At Erfurt he bade
farewell to his wife. On November 16, 1632, at Liitzen, near Leipzig,
the two greatest generals of the age came at last face to face: Gustavus
with 25,000, Wallenstein with 40,000 men. All day the armies fought and
bled, wavered and re-formed. Wallenstein was forced to give way, but
Pappenheim reversed that rout till, shot through the lung, he choked
with blood and died. Gustavus, seeing his center re- treat, put himself
at the head of a regiment of cavalry and led a wild rally. A bullet
struck his bridle arm, another his horse; he fell; a bullet en-</p>
<p>tered his back; Imperial cuirassiers closed around him and asked who
he was; he answered, “I am the King of Sweden, who do seal the re -
ligion and liberty of the German n ation with my blood.”^° They drove
their swords again and again into his body, and shouted out the news of
his</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>565</p>
<p>death. Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, took over the command; and the
Swedes, maddened by the loss of their King, carried everything before
them, won the costly victory, and reclaimed Gustavus’ body, riddled with
shot and sword. That night the defeated rejoiced and the victors
mourned, for the Lion of the North was dead.</p>
<p>4 . Degradation: 16 ^^-48</p>
<p>Thereafter greatness left the war. Richelieu took the leadership of
the German Protestants, Oxenstierna carried on his dead master’s will
with wise diplomacy, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar led the French, Baner and
Torstensson the Swedes, to new victories; but the glory was departed and
only the horror remained. The Protestant princes were half relieved at
Gustavus’ death; they grudged the heavy price he had been forced to
take</p>
<p>Wallenstein, having for the first time tasted defeat, seemed to lose
his nerve. After Liitzen he retired to Bohemia and slowly organized
another army. But he too, now fifty, was tired of war, and he hoped for
leisure to treat his gout. He negotiated independently with the
Protestant leaders, even with Richelieu;’‘^ and Ferdinand must have
known that Bohemian exiles, with Oxenstierna’s approval, were plotting
to place Wallenstein on the Bohemian throne.’’^ When Bernhard of
Saxe-Weimar led an army into Bavaria, Maximilian and Ferdinand begged
Wallenstein to come to the rescue; Wallenstein replied that he could
spare no men for such a move. He quartered his idle army on the Imperial
estates in Bohemia; the Emperor asked him to ligliten the contributions
imposed upon these Imperial lands; Wallenstein refused.</p>
<p>On December 31, 1633, Ferdinand and his Council decided that their
greatest general must be deposed. Rumors were disseminated through
Wallenstein’s army that he was plotting to make himself King of Bohemia,
and Louis XIII King of the Romans. On February 18 Imperial orders were
posted throughout his army, relieving him of his command. Four days
later, taking a thousand men with him, he fled from Pilsen. At Eger, on
the twenty-fifth, a few soldiers, hoping for reward, broke into his
room, found him alone and unarmed, and pierced him through with their
swords. “Presently,” reported a contemporary, “they drew him out by the
heels, his head knocking on every stair. The assassins hurried to
Vienna, where they received promotion, money, and land. The Emperor, who
had spent days and nights in fear and prayer, thanked God for His
co-operation.</p>

<p>old son and namesake replaced Wallenstein as commander in chief of
the Imperial armies. He was a likable youth, educated, kindly, generous,
loving philosophy, writing music, carving ivory, yet no fool on the
battlefield. Helped by older generals, he overwhelmed Bernhard at
Nordlingen in the most decisive Imperialist victory of the war. The
Protestant forces neared collapse. Oxenstierna saved the situation by
the Treaty of Compiegne (April 28, 1635), which committed Richelieu to
fuller participation in the conflict; but the Protestant princes of
Germany did not relish the pros- pect of a French cardinal determining
their fate. One by one they followed John George of Saxony in making
peace with the Emperor, who welcomed them because he saw himself faced
with the armies, as well as the money, of France. By the Treaty of
Prague (May 30, 1635) he agreed to suspend the Edict of Restitution for
forty years, and in return most of the Protestant princes promised to
help him and his allies to recover all territories lost by them since
the coming of Adolphus. As these included Lorraine, the treaty was in
effect aimed at France as well as Sweden; it was a reassertion of German
unity against invaders. The religious question disappeared from the war.
By the end of 1635 the army of Protestant Saxony was fighting the
Protestant Swedes in northern Germany, where Baner and Torstensson, with
a military genius worthy of Gustavus, struggled to hold some Con-
tinental possessions for Sweden’s security.</p>
<p>In the west Bernhard stood off bravely the growing forces of the
Empire. In 1638 France sent him funds and, better still, 2,000 troops
under Turenne, who was already rising to fame as a general. So
reinforced, Bernhard under- took a campaign memorable in military annals
for tenacity of purpose and brilliance of strategy. He defeated the
Imperialists at Wittenweier, and compelled the great fortress of
Breisach to capitulate. Then, exhausted at thirty-four, he died (1639),
and his army and his conquests, including Alsace, passed to France.</p>
<p>The old Emperor had left the scene in 1637, and Ferdinand III,
inheriting an Empire of untaxable destitution, found it almost
impossible to finance armies against a Richelieu who could still wring
francs from impoverished France. In 1642 Torstensson carried the Swedish
arms to within twenty- five miles of Vienna and won a major victory in
the second battle of Breitenfeld, where the Imperialists lost 10,000
men. The defeated Archduke Leopold William, brother of the young
Emperor, court-martialed his officers for cowardice, beheaded those of
high rank, hanged those of less degree, and shot every tenth man in the
ranks of the survivors.’^*</p>
<p>Every year seemed now to bring new blows to the new Emperor. In</p>
<p>1643 his ally Spain was broken by the victory of the Duke of Enghien
at Rocroi; in 1644 Enghien and Turenne conquered the Rhineland as far
north as Mainz; in 1645 Torstensson again swept down almost to the
gates</p>

<p>of Vienna, the French won a bloody battle at Allerheim, and a Swedish
army under Count Hans Christoph von Konigsmarck overran Saxony, took
Leipzig, and forced John George out of the war. The Bavarian army had
been driven out of the Palatinate in 1634; in 1646 Turenne invaded and
devastated Bavaria itself, and the once proud Maximilian sued for peace
and begged the Emperor to come to terms with France. Ferdinand III, not
as somberly inflexible as his father, and hearing the cry of the
prostrate Empire, sent his ablest negotiators to Westphalia to seek some
compromise between the faiths and the dynasties.</p>
<p>He was too young to know that the carnage and the desolation were
probably greater than men had ever wrought in one generation in any land
before. There were not two armies but six — German, Danish, Swedish,
Bohemian, Spanish, French; armies manned largely by mercenaries or
foreigners having no attachment to the German people or soil or history,
and led by military adventurers fighting for any faitb for a fee; armies
fed by appropriating the grains and fruits and cattle of the fields,
quartered and wintering in the homes of the people, and recompensed with
the right to plunder and the ecstasy of killing and rape. To massacre
any garrison that had refused to surrender, after surrender had become
inevitable, was a principle accepted by all combatants. Soldiers felt
that civilians were legiti- mate prey; they shot at their feet in the
streets, conscripted them as servants, kidnaped their children for
ransom, fired their haystacks and burned their churches for fun. They
cut off the hands and feet of a Protestant pastor who resisted the
wrecking of his church; they tied priests under wagons, forcing them to
crawl on all fours till they fainted with exhaustion.’‘® The right of a
soldier to rape was taken for granted; when a father asked for justice
against a soldier who had raped and killed his daughter, he was in-
formed by the commanding officer that if the girl had not been so stingy
with her virginity she would still be alive.’’®</p>
<p>Despite the spreading promiscuity, the population of Germany rapidly
declined during the war. The decline has been exaggerated and was tempo-
rary, but it was catastrophic. Moderate estimates reckon a fall, in
Germany and Austria, from 21,000,000 to 13,500,000.’’’ Count von Liitzow
calcu- lated a reduction of population in Bohemia from 3,000,000 to
800,000.’® Of 35,000 villages existing in Bohemia in 1618, some 29,000
were deserted during the conflict.’® Throughout the Empire hundreds of
villages were left without a single inhabitant. In some regions one
might travel sixty miles without seeing a village or a house.*® Of 1,717
houses standing in nineteen Thuringian villages in 1618 only 627 stood
in 1649, and many of these were untenanted.**</p>
<p>Thousands of fertile acres were left untilled for lack of men,
draft</p>
<p>animals, or seed, or because peasants had no assurance that they
could</p>

<p>reap where they had sown. Crops were used to feed armies, and what
re- mained was burned to prevent the feeding of foes. Peasants in many
locali- ties were reduced to eating hidden remnants or dogs, cats, rats,
acorns, grass; some dead were found with grass in their mouths. Men and
women com- peted with ravens and dogs for the flesh of dead horses. In
Alsace hanged offenders were tom from the gallows to be eagerly
devoured; in the Rhine- land exhumed bodies were sold for food; at
Zweibriicken a woman con- fessed to having eaten her child.®*
Transportation was too disrupted to let a local surplus feed a distant
drought; roads were torn up with battle, or dangerous with brigands, or
clogged with deserters and fugitives.</p>
<p>The towns suffered only less than the villages. Many of them were re-
duced to half their former population. Great cities were in ruins —
^Magde- burg, Heidelberg, Wurzburg, Neustadt, Bayreuth. Industry
declined for lack of producers, purchasers, and trade; commerce hid its
head; once- wealthy merchants begged and robbed for bread. Communes,
declaring themselves bankrupt, repudiated their debts. Financiers were
loath to lend, fearing that loans would be gifts. Taxation impoverished
everybody but generals, tax collectors, prelates, and kings. The air was
poisonous with refuse and offal and carcasses rotting in the streets.
Epidemics of typhus, typhoid, dysentery, and scurvy ran through the
terrified population and from town to town. Spanish troops passing
through Munich left a plague that in four months carried off 10,000
victims.®® The arts and letters that had ennobled the cities withered in
the heat of war.</p>
<p>Morals and morale alike collapsed. The fatalism of despair invited
the cynicism of brutality. All the ideals of religion and patriotism
disappeared after a generation of violence; simple men now fought for
food or drink or hate, while their masters mobilized their passions in
the competition for taxable lands and political power. Here and there
some humane features showed: Jesuits gathering and feeding deserted
children; preachers demand- ing of governments an end to bloodshed and
destruction. “God send that there may be art end at last,” wrote a
peasant in his daybook. “God send that there may be peace again. Go d in
heaven, send us peace.”®^</p>

<li>THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA</li>
</ol>
<p>Ever since 1635 the rulers and their diplomats had been extending
feelers for peace. In that year Pope Urban VIII proposed a congress to
discuss terms of reconciliation; negotiators met at Cologne, to no
result. At Ham- burg in 1641 the representatives of France, Sweden, and
the Empire drew up a preliminary agreement for a double conference to
meet in Westphalia</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>IMPERIAL ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p>569</p>
<p>in 1642: at Munster France would treat with the Empire under the
media- tion of the papacy and Venice; at Osnabriick, thirty miles away,
France and the Empire would treat with Sweden under the mediation of
Christian IV of Denmark. This antiseptic segregation was made necessary
by the unwillingness of the Swedish emissaries to confer under the
presidency of a papal nuncio, and the refusal of the nuncio to sit in
the same room with a “heretic.”</p>
<p>Delays were caused by questions of safe-conducts and protocol. Tor-
stensson’s victory at Breitenfeld spurred the Emperor to promise that
his deputies would arrive by July 1 1, 1643. Then the French delegates
dallied while France arranged an alliance with the United Provinces
against Spain. The Congress of Westphalia was formally opened December
4, 1644, with 135 members, including theologians and philosophers. Even
then six months were consumed in deciding in what order of precedence
the delegates were to enter rooms and be seated. The French ambassador
would not negotiate unless he was given the title Altesse — ^Highness.
When the Spanish ambas- sador arrived he shunned the French ambassador
because neither would give precedence to the other; they communicated
through a third person. France refused to recognize Philip IV’s title as
King of Portugal and</p>
<p>Prince of Catalonia; Spain refused to accept Louis XIV’s title as
King of Navarre. The Swedish representatives quarreled and marked time
until the resolute young Queen Christina peremptorily ordered them to
make peace among themselves and with the enemy. Meanwhile men were going
to their death in war.</p>
<p>As each party’s armies were victorious or defeated, its envoys
delayed or hurried negotiations; lawyers were kept busy inventing
difficulties or compromises, tying or untying knots. France’s generals
were striking their stride; so she insisted on having all the German
princes represented at the conference, though most of them had long
since made peace with the Emperor; time was asked to stop till all the
electors, princes, and Imperial cities had sent their diplomats. To
weaken France, Spain signed (January 7, 1648) a separate peace with the
United Provinces — ^which had just promised France to sign no separate
peace; but the Dutch could not resist the chance to acquire, by a few
strokes of the pen, what they had fought for through eighty years.
France retaliated by refusing to make peace with Spain; their war went
on till the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659).</p>
<p>The Congress might have adjourned without result had not the devasta-
tion of Bavaria by Turenne, and the attack of the Swedes upon Prague
(July 1648), and the defeat of the Spanish at Lens (August 2) persuaded
the Emperor to sign; while the outbreak of the Fronde in France (July)
impelled Mazarin to concessions that would leave him free for war at
home.</p>

<p>So, at last, the Treaty of Westphalia was concluded, at both Munster
and Osnabriick, on October 24, 1648. Bloodshed went on for nine days
more while the news traveled to the fronts. Humble and joyous Te Deums
rose from a thousand villages and towns.</p>
<p>Let us admit that the negotiations had faced more complicated
problems of adjustment than any peace conference before the twentieth
century, and that they settled the conflicting claims as wisely as the
prevailing hatreds, prides, and powers allowed. The terms of this
Europe-remaking treaty must be summarized, for they condensed and
produced much history.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Switzerland and the United Provinces won formal recognition of
their independence.</p></li>
<li><p>Bavaria received the Upper (south) Palatinate, with its electoral
vote.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lower (north) Palatinate, as an eighth electorate, was
restored to Charles Louis, son of the dead Frederick.</p></li>
<li><p>Brandenburg acquired eastern Pomerania, the bishoprics of Minden,
Halberstadt, and Cammin, and the succession to the bishopric of Magde-
burg. France helped the rising dynasty of the Hohenzollerns to get these
plums, with a view to raising another power against the Hapsburgs;
France could not be expected to foresee that Brandenburg, become
Prussia, would, under Frederick the Great, challenge France and, under
Bismarck, would defeat her.</p></li>
<li><p>Sweden, chiefly through her victorious armies, but partly through
French support at the congress, received the bishoprics of Bremen and
Verden, the towns of Wismar and Stettin, and the territory at the mouth
of the Oder. Since these were Imperial fiefs, Sweden had now a seat in
the Imperial Diet; and as she already held Livonia, Esthonia, Ingria,
Karelia, and Finland, she was now one of the Great Powers, mistress of
the Baltic till Peter the Great.</p></li>
<li><p>The German principalities retained and confirmed their prewar
lib- erties as against the emperors.</p></li>
<li><p>The Emperor had to be content with the acknowledgment of
his</p></li>
</ol>
<p>royal rights in Bohemia and Hungary; so the Austro-Hungarian Empire
took form as the actuality within the shell of the Holy Roman Empire.
The economic back of the aging Empire was broken, partly by the reduc-
tion of population and the disruption of industry and trade through the
war, but also by the passing of the great river outlets to foreign
powers — of the Oder and the Elbe to Sweden and of the Rhine to the
United</p>
<p>Provinces.</p>

<li>The greatest gains went to France, whose money had financed the

<p>the fortress of Breisach on the German side of the Rhine; Louis XIV
was now in a position to take Franche-Comte and Lorraine at his
convenience. The aim of the now dead Richelieu had been achieved — to
break the power of the Hapsburgs, to extend the frontiers of France, to
improve French unity and defense, and to preserve in the Empire a chaos
of prin- cipalities, a conflict between princes and emperor, and an
opposition be- tween the Protestant north and the Catholic south, that
would protect France from the peril of a united Germany. France had
replaced Spain — the Bourbons had replaced the Hapsburgs — as the
dominant force in Europe; soon Louis XIV would be equated with the
sun.</p>
<p>The hidden victim of the war was Christianity. The Roman Church had
to abandon the Edict of Restitution, to return to the property situation
of 1624, and to see the princes again determining the religion of their
subjects; this, however, enabled the Church to banish Protestantism from
Bohemia, the land of the Hussite Reformation. The Counter Reformation
was</p>
<p>checked; for example, it was out of the question that Poland should
estab- lish Catholicism in a Protestant Sweden twice as strong as
before. The papal nuncio at Munster refused to sign the treaty; Pope
Innocent X de- clared it “null and void, accursed, and without any
influence or result for the past, the present, or the future” (November
20, 1648).®® E urope ignored the protest. From that time the papacy
ceased to be a major po- litical power, and religion in Europe
declineii.</p>
<p>Some Protestants protested, too, especially those who had lost their
homes in Bohemia and Austria. But all in all the treaty — fruit of a
dead and a living cardinal — ^was a Protestant victory. Protestantism
had been saved in Germany. It was weakened in the south and along the
Rhine, but in the north it was stronger than before. The Reformed, or
Calvinist, Church was officially recognized in the treaty. The lines of
religious di - vision established in 1648 remained essentially unchanged
until, in the twentieth century, the differential birth rate began a
gradual and peaceful extension of Catholicism.</p>
<p>But though the Reformation had been saved, it suffered, along with
Catholicism, from a skepticism encouraged by the coarseness of religious
polemics, the brutality of the war, and the cruelties of belief. During
the h olocaust thousands of “witches” were put to death. Men began to
doubt creeds that preached Christ and practiced wholesale fratricide.
They dis- covered the political and economic motives that hid under
religious formulas, and they suspected their rulers of having no real
faith but the lust for power — though Ferdinand II had repeatedly risked
his power for the sake of his; faith. Even in this darkest of modern
ages an increasing number of m^^n turned to science and philosophy for

enforce. Galileo was dramatizing the Copemican revolution, Descartes was
ques- tioning all tradition and authority, Bruno was crying out to
Europe from his agonies at the stake. The Peace of Westphalia ended the
reign of the- ology over the European mind, and left the road obstructed
but passable for the tentatives of reason.</p>
