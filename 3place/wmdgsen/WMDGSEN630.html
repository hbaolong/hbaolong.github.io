<p>I 8 I I — I 2</p>
<p>I. THE CONTINENTAL BLOCKADE</p>
<p>T HE direct cause of the Franco- Russian War of 1812 was Russia’s re
- fusal to continue its observance of the Continental Blockade declared
by Napoleon’s Berl in Decree of November 21, 1806. This decree was Na-
poleon’s plan for closing all the ports and coasts of the European
Continent against the entry of British goods. Its purpose was to force
Great Britain to end the blockade which it had declared (May 16, 1806)
of all French- controlled ports from Brest to the Elbe; to end British
interference with France’s maritime trade; to secure the restoration of
French colonies cap - tured by Great Britain; and to end the British
financing of Continental states in their wars against France.</p>
<p>How was the Continental Blockade working? By 1810 it had brought
England to a severe economic depression. In the first two years
(1806-08) after Napoleon’s Berlin Decree, Britain’s exports fell from
^40,800,000 to ^35,200,000; imports of raw cotton fell by ninety-five
percent. As one result the domestic price of corn rose from sixty-six to
ninety-four shillings per quarter (one fourth of a hundredweight) in
little more than one year (1807-08). Meanwhile slackened foreign trade
depressed wages, spread un- employment, and set off violent strikes.
Britain needed Swedish iron for her industry and Russian lumber for her
ships; war with Sweden and Russia’s alliance with France (1807) closed
those sources. Britain struggled to coun- ter such setbacks by
protecting her remaining trade outlets; her exports to Portugal, Spain,
and Turkey rose four hundred percent between 1805 and 1 8 1 1 ; hence
Napoleon’s costly invasion of the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Matters worsened in Britain as the blockade continued; her exports to
northern Europe declined twenty percent in 1810-11. Her adverse trade
balance caused a rise in gold payments to Europe, and brought the inter-
national value of the pound to so low a point that Grenville and Grey,
lead- ers of the Opposition, called for peace at any price. 1 In 181 1,
one year before Napoleon’s war with Russia, his Continental Blockade
reached its maximum effect in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Relatively to England the rival blockades substantially advantaged
France. Her port cities — Le Havre, Nantes, Bordeaux, Marseilles — were
in such de- cay that the last two began to call for a return of the
Bourbons, 2 but internal commerce benefited from the exclusion of
British competition, the influx of</p>
<p>693</p>
<p>694 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>gold, the abundance of capital, and the subsidies provided by a
businessman’s government which enriched its Treasury with the gains of
war. French business profited still more from these factors, and from
improved access to Continental markets under Napoleon’s control.
Mechanical weaving quadrupled from 1806 to 1810, accelerating the
Industrial Revolution in France. Full employment and political stability
within the extended frontiers gave industry such stimulus that if France
had won the Napoleonic Wars she might have caught up with England in
production and world trade.</p>
<p>The blockade was favorable to industry and domestic trade, injurious
to foreign commerce, in the “Continental System” of states subject to Na
po- leon. The Hanseatic cities — Amsterdam, Hamburg, Bremen, Liibeck —
natu- rally suffered from the double blockade; but Switzerland, northern
Italy, and the Rhineland communities prospered from the unhindered
extension of Napoleonic institutions. Farther east, where industry was
less developed, the blockade, preventing the sale of the region’s
produce to Britain, was a burden that generated rising discontent. This,
of course, was especially so in Russia.</p>
<p>The basic weakness of the Continental Blockade was that it ran
counter to the human demand for freedom to explore every avenue of gain.
The ports and coastal towns of Europe abounded in men who were willing
to risk their lives in smuggling into the Continent British goods made
doubly attractive by prohibition. Conversely Continental manufacturers
who had enjoyed foreign outlets complained that they had to sacrifice
British mar- kets. In Holland the resentment of the great merchant
families so moved K ing Louis Bonaparte that he wrote to Czar Alexander
a letter “surpassing in bitterness against Napoleon the most merciless
pamphlets.” 3</p>
<p>Against the rising opposition Napoleon used 200,000 customs houses,
thou- sands of agents recognizable or disguised, and countless troops to
detect vio- lations of the blockade, to arrest and punish and
confiscate. In 1812 the court of customs in Hamburg pronounced in
eighteen days 127 sentences, some to death; these, however, were rarely,
if ever, carried out. Confiscated goods were sold for the French
Treasury, some were burned in public bon- fires that alienated nearly
all onlookers.</p>
<p>Partly to moderate hostility, to raise income, or to ease shortages,
Napo- leon, as long ago related, began in 1 809 to sell licenses,
usually for a thousand francs, to import British goods judged necessary
to French industry or morale, or to export to Britain goods paid for in
coffee, sugar, or gold. Brit- ain had already issued similar licenses —
44,346 of them between 1807 and 1 8 1 2 — to override British embargoes.
4 By comparison Napoleon issued only 494 licenses by November 25, 181 1;
5 but Alexander pointed out that while Napoleon demanded strict
exclusion of British goods from Russia, he con- nived at their admission
into France.</p>
<p>All in all, the Continental Blockade, despite its widespread
unpopularity and the difficulties and blunders in its enforcement,
seemed, in 1810, to be succeeding. England was on the verge of
bankruptcy, even of a revolution demanding peace; the states allied with
France were grumbling but submis-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) TO MOSCOW 695</p>
<p>sive; and France, despite the human and financial drain of the
Peninsular War, was prospering as perhaps never before. The Frenchman
had little freedom, but he had francs, and his aliquot portion of the
glory of victorious France and its incomparable Emperor.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FRANCE IN DEPRESSION: l8ll</li>
</ol>
<p>Then suddenly, as if some evil force was coordinating catastrophes,
the whole many-faceted economy seemed to fall to pieces, and to founder
in a whirlpool of bank failures, market disruptions, factory closings,
unemploy- ment, strikes, poverty, riots, and the threat of starvation —
just as the miracle- working Emperor was planning to raise money and
troops and morale for a life-and-death struggle with a Russia distant,
unknown, and immense.</p>
<p>The causes of a recent depression are hard to specify; how shall we
ana- lyze the causes of that 1 8 1 1 depression in France, which was
apparently more severe than any that the oldest among us can remember? A
learned historian 6 ascribes it to two main sources: ( i ) the failure
of the French tex- tile industry to secure needed raw material and
capital; and (2) the failure of a banking firm in Liibeck. French
spinning mills had relied upon the im- portation of raw cotton for their
looms; the protectionist policy of the French government had placed a
high tariff on such imports; the supply fell and its price rose; the
French mills could not afford to pay this price for all the material
needed to keep all their looms busy; they could not pay the ris- ing
rate of interest charged by French banks for capital loans; the mill
own- ers felt forced to discharge more and more of their employees. The
failure of the Liibeck bank, soon followed by similar bankruptcies in
Hamburg and Amsterdam, affected Parisian firms; bank failures in France
rose from seventeen in October, 1810, to forty-one in November, to
sixty-one in Janu- ary, 1 8 1 1. The scarcity and high cost of bank
loans forced one business firm after another to reduce its working
staff, even to suspend operations; soon the streets of French cities
were crowded with jobless workers seeking to sell their possessions, or
begging for bread; some committed suicide. 7 Bands of unemployed, in the
Nord department, raided farms and seized the grain; in the towns they
attacked markets and warehouses; on roads and rivers they stopped and
pillaged transports of food; the chaos of 1793 seemed to have
returned.</p>
<p>Napoleon decreed severe punishments for crimes against public order,
sent soldiers to check violent strikes, and organized free distributions
of food. A decree of August 28 sent 500,000 hundredweights of wheat and
30,000 sacks of flour to critical centers of distress. Meanwhile he
interrupted the Continental Blockade to allow the import of alien corn;
he raised tariffs on foreign products competing with French industries;
he arranged govern- ment loans to enable firms to resume employment and
production. In May, 1812, following revolutionary precedents, he decreed
a “maximum” price for wheat; it failed, for farmers kept their product
from the market until</p>
<p>696</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>hey received the price they demanded. Private charity helped the
govern- ment to avoid a national upheaval. Count Rumford,
American-British scien- tist then living in France, arranged “soupes de
Rumfort,” made chiefly of beans and peas, which not only provided
vegetable proteins but appeased the cry for bread.</p>
<p>This economic crisis, coming amid preparations for his invasion of
Rus- sia, was a test of nerves for Napoleon, and it may have shared in
weakening his confidence and resolution. But his good fortune did not
yet desert him. The harvest of 1812 promised and proved to be abundant;
bread became cheaper; the unemployed could at least eat. Banks reopened
or were replaced by new ones; loans were made; capital, that unseen and
indispensable pro- ducer, resumed its role in the factories; wages could
be paid for work on goods that might take half a year to reach a
purchaser; the markets were again supplied. Now Napoleon could dedicate
himself to a war to enforce a blockade that had already been doomed by
the behavior of nations and the nature of man.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PREFACE TO WAR: 1 8 1 1-1 2</li>
</ol>
<p>The imperial adversaries prepared for the combat with diplomatic
moves, military accumulations, and mass movements of men. Each tried to
persuade the other that he was a devotee of peace. Napoleon chose as his
ambassador Armand de Caulaincourt, a man of more than merely
genealogical nobility. Arrived in St. Petersburg (November, 1807),
Caulaincourt was impressed by the development of Alexander from the
diffident young ruler whom he had seen there in 1801; the Czar had
become a paragon of good looks, grace- ful manners, and friendly speech.
Alexander professed himself a lover of Napoleon, still dedicated to the
agreements made at Tilsit — given some slight adjustments which the
brilliant Emperor of the French would find reason- able.</p>
<p>Poland divided them. Napoleon had established the grand duchy of War-
saw (1807) under a French protectorate; Alexander countered by wooing
Polish nobles with an offer to restore all pre-partition Poland as a
kingdom internally autonomous but recognizing the czar of Russia as its
king and master of its external relations. Letters containing this offer
fell into Napo- leon’s hands, and infuri ated him. 8 He recalled
Caulaincourt (February, 18 1 1), and replaced him, as French ambassador
to Russia, with Jacques Law, the future Marquis de Lauriston.</p>
<p>In this month Alexander urged Austria to join him in an attack
upon</p>
<p>Napoleon’s forces in Poland, offering her, as incidental profit, half
of Mol - davia and all of Wallachia; 9 Austria refused. Napoleon at
St. Helena shed some light on his Polish policy: “I would never have
waged war with Russia simply to serve the inter ests of the Polish
nobility”; and as for freeing the serfs, “I could never forget that when
I spoke to the Polish serfs about liberty, they answered, ’Certainly we
should like to have it very much; but</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) TO MOSCOW 697</p>
<p>who will feed, cloth e, and house us?’ ” 10 — i.e., they would have
floundered helplessly in any sudden change.</p>
<p>Caulaincourt, loaded with gifts from the Czar, reached Paris on June
5, 18 1 1. He tried at great length to convince Napoleon of Alexander’s
pacific intentions, and warned him that a French invasion of Russia
would be doomed to defeat by climate and space. Napoleon concluded that
Caulain- court, violating correct diplomatic procedure, had fallen in
love with the Czar. 11 Abandoning hope of a peaceful solution, and
suspecting Russian at- tempts at seducing Prussia and Austria, 12
Napoleon massed troops in or near Prussia, and frightened Frederick
William III into signing an alliance with France (March 5, 1812); this
committed Prussia to provide twenty thou- sand troops for the French
invasion of Russia, and to feed the French army when it passed through
Prussia; the cost of the food was to be subtracted from the indemnity
still owed by Prussia to France. 13 On March 14 Austria entered into a
similar forced alliance with France. In April Napoleon pro- posed to the
Sultan an alliance by which Turkey would expand her conflict with Russia
into a holy war, and cooperate with France in a simultaneous march upon
Moscow; in case of success the Porte was to regain the Dan- ubian
principalities, and secure full control of the Crimea and the Black Sea.
Remembering that Napoleon had fought the Turks in Egypt and Syria, and
had, at Tilsit, offered Alexander a free hand against Turkey, the Sultan
re- jected the proposal, and signed peace with Russia (May 28, 1812). On
April 5 Alexander signed a pact of mutual aid with Sweden; on April 18
he offered peace and alliance with Great Britain. On May 29 he declared
all Russian ports open to ships of all nations. In effect this was to
withdraw from the Continental Blockade, and to declare war upon
France.</p>
<p>Along with this diplomatic duel went one of the most massive military
preparations in history. Here Alexa nder’s task was narrower and simpler
than Napoleon’s; he had only one country to mobilize in force and senti
- ment. The sentiment almost took care of itself: Mother Russia rose
spon- taneously against the hordes of barbarians that were being
organized against her by a savage infidel. The patriotic fervor that had
condemned the Peace of Tilsit was transformed into religious support of
the Czar. Wherever he went simple men and women crowded around him,
kissing his horse or his boots. So strengthened, he enlarged his armies,
ordered them to prepare for war, and stationed 200,000 men along the
Dvina and the Dnieper, the great rivers that divided Russian Russia from
the Lithuanian and Polish provinces taken in the partitions. 14</p>
<p>Napoleon’s mobilizatio n was more complex. He faced the initial
difficulty that 300,000 French troops, and a dozen French generals, were
tied down in Spain, and that even more might be needed to keep
Wellington from march- ing through the Peninsula and over the Pyrenees
into France. He had hoped to return to Spain and repeat his victories of
1809; now he had to choose between losing Spain, Portugal, and the
blockade and losing the Russian alliance and the blockade. “I kne w
better than anyone that Spain was a gnawing cancer that had to be healed
before we could enter upon such a</p>
<p>698 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>errible war, in which the first battle would be fought fifteen
hundred miles from my frontier.” 16</p>
<p>He had begun his military preparations in 1 8 1 o by quietly
strengthening the French garrison in Danzig, and adding, as
imperceptibly as he could, to the French contingents policing Prussia.
In January, 1811, he called to the colors the year’s conscript s, and
distributed them along the German coast from the Elbe to the Oder, to
guard against a Russian flank attack by sea. In the spring he ordered
the princes of the Rhineland Confederation to pre- pare their pledged
quotas of troops for active service. In August he began a painstaking
study of the Russian terrain, and fixed upon June as the best month for
an invasion. 16 In December he prepared a network of spies to work in or
around Russia. 17</p>
<p>By February, 1812, both sides had completed their mobilization. The
French conscription had revealed a sharp decline in the popularity of
the army: of 300,000 men called to the colors 80,000 failed to appear,
and thou- sands of these were hunted down as outlaws. 18 Many of the
recruits de- serted, or made unwilling soldiers, and proved dangerously
unreliable in a crisis. In former campaigns the newcomers would have
received proud example and avuncular encouragement from the veterans of
the Imperial Guard; but now most members of that brotherhood of battle
were dead, or in Spain, or too old to be heroes except in reminiscences.
Nor had the re- cruits the inspiration of a united and enthusiastic
nation behind them. Napo- leon appealed to them, and to his subjects, to
see the enterprise as a holy war of Western civilization against the
swelling wave of Slavic barbarism; 19 but the skeptical French had heard
such stories before, and in any case Russia was too far away to frighten
them. He tried to arouse his generals, but al- most to a man, out of his
hearing, they were against the new war as an invi- tation to tragedy.
Many of them had grown rich by his largesse, and wished he had let them
enjoy it in peace.</p>
<p>Some of his aides were brave enough to voice their doubts to his
face. Caulaincourt, though always loyal to him, and serving him till
1814 as his grand equerry, or master of the horse, warned him that war
with Russia would be disastrous, and even dared to tell him that he had
gone to all this trouble “to satisfy his fondest passion,” war. 20
Fouche, supposedly banished from the imperial presence because of his
incurable plotting, but recalled to keep him in sight or on leash, told
Napoleon (if Fouche can ever be be- lieved) that it was climatically
impossible to defeat Russia, and that he was being misled by the dream
of universal dominion. 21 Napoleon explained that his dream was only to
found a United States of Europe, to give the Continent one modern legal
code, one coinage, one system of weights and measures, one court of
appeals — all under one three-cornered hat. And this immense,
unprecedented army, which he had so toiled to assemble and equip — how
could he send it home now, and walk through the rest of his life with
his tail between his legs?</p>
<p>It was verily an immense army, 680,000 men, including 100,000
cavalry, not counting political officials, servants, and attendant
women. Of the total,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) TO MOSCOW 699</p>
<p>less than half were French; the rest were contingents requisitioned
from Italy, Illyria, Austria, Germany, and Poland. There were half a
hundred generals — Lefebvre, Davout, Oudinot, Ney, Murat, Victor,
Augereau, Eu- gene de Beauhamais, and Prince Jozef Antoni Poniatowski,
nephew of Poland’s last and knightly King. All these forces were
gathered into separate armies, at various points en route to Russia,
each general with specific in- structions when and where to lead his
host.</p>
<p>The task of equipping and provisioning such a multitude had probably
required more genius, patience, and money than to assemble it. Indeed,
both the early and later stages of the enterprise were vitally affected
by logistic conditions; the campaign could not open until the soil had
grown enough grass to feed the horses; its ruin was almost completed by
the Russian cap- ture of the provisions that the returning, famished
French had expected to find at Smolensk. Napoleon tried to foresee
everything but disaster. He ar- ranged to have stores of materiel,
mechanical parts and repairs, food, cloth- ing, medicines, at Wesel,
Cologne, Bonn, Coblenz, Mainz, and other points on the routes of his
converging armies; and similar supplies were to follow, in hundreds of
transport vehicles, the advance of the invaders in Russia. Napoleon knew
where to buy and what to pay; he knew the wiles of con- tractors, and
was ready to hand over to a firing squad a merchant who knowingly
overcharged his armies, or sold them shoddy goods.</p>
<p>How did he pay for all these supplies, and for their transport and
storage, and for the men who used them? He taxed, he levied loans, he
borrowed from the Banque de France and private banks; he took millions
from his private horde of 380 million francs in gold in the cellars of
the Tuileries. He checked extravagance wherever he could; he scolded his
divorced be- loved Josephine for spending like an empress, and praised
Empress Marie Louise for her economies. 22 All in all, he said later,
“the Russian campaign… was the best, the most skillful, the most
cleverly led, and the most methodical of all the campaigns that I have
commanded.” 23</p>
<p>Was he fit to command it? Probably better than any of his contempo-
raries, but less fit than the enterprise required. At forty-three he was
already too old for camp life and battle duties. We may presume that he
was suf- fering from the ailments that were to hamper him at Borodino
and Water- loo: stomach pains, frequency and difficulty of urination,
and piles. Though still, in private, a man of kindness and justice, a
good husband to Marie Louise and a fond father to their son, he had
become, after eight years of imperial power, impatient, dictatorial,
easily angered, and given to overesti- mating nis mental and political
power. There were many exceptions: he bore Caulaincourt’s criticism with
good humor, and forgave many costly mistakes in his brothers and
generals. He had moments of realism about himself. “In the midst of his
meditations,” his secretary tells us, “I often heard Napoleon
characterize his position with this expression: ‘The bow is
overstretched.’” 24 But he had been too seldom defeated to have reached
perspective and self- limitation. “After all,” he told Narbonne, “this
long road [to Moscow] is the road to India.” 25</p>

<p>So, on May 9, 1812, he left St.-Cloud, bound at least for Moscow.
Every- thing in his life had been a gamble, and this was the greatest of
them all.</p>

<li>THE ROAD TO MOSCOW: ’JUNE 26 - SEPTEMBER 1 4, l8l2</li>
</ol>
<p>Marie Louise had persuaded him to let her accompany him as far as
Dres- den, and to invite her parents to meet them there, so that she
might be once more, however briefly, with her family. Napoleon agreed,
and thought it wise to invite also Frederick William III of Prussia, and
divers other royal- ties and notables. From Mainz eastward his passage
through the Rhineland became a triumphant procession as the local rulers
came out to receive their suzerain; they joined his cortege as he
advanced into Saxony. A few miles west of Dresden they were met by King
Frederick Augustus, who escorted them into his capital. They reached the
city an hour before midnight on May 16. The streets they followed were
crowded with people holding torches and crying welcome; salvos of
artillery were fired, and church bells rang. 26</p>
<p>On May 18 Metternich arrived with the Emperor and Empress of Aus-
tria*; Marie Louise embraced her father with visible emotion; her
happiness was softened by her premonition that the year was heavy with
misfortune. Soon thereafter came the King and Crown Prince of Prussia,
probably un- comfortable amid the apparent entente cordiale between
their country’s his - toric enemies; however, Czar Alexander had secret
assurance that both Prussia and Austria were praying for Napoleon’s
defeat. 27 King Frederick Augustus, as host, lightened their politics
with opera, drama, hunting, fire- works, dances, and receptions at which
the rulers of Germany paid homage to Napoleon, who, apparently modest,
beamed for twelve days from the zenith of his curve.</p>
<p>On May 28 he set out to join one of his armies at Thorn on the
Vistula. Orders had gone out to his generals to meet him on the banks of
the River Niemen, which separated the grand duchy of Warsaw from Russia.
He him- self rode in a carriage equipped with a lamp, a table, writing
materials, maps, and books. Each night on the march this equipment was
transferred to a tent, where he composed, and issued to his secretaries,
the orders to be trans- mitted to generals for the morrow’s operations.
His old secretary Meneval, his newer secretary, Frangois Fain, and his
valet Very Constant accom- panied him all the way to Moscow and return.
He reached the Niemen on June 23, reconnoitered, and saw no sign of
enemy presence on the other side. Three pontoon bridges were soon set
up, and on June 24-26 some 200,000 of his men crossed to the town of
Kovno (now Kaunas). Almost at the same time another French army of some
200,000 men crossed the same river far- ther downstream at Tilsit (now
Sovetsk), 28 where Napoleon and Alexander, five years earlier, had sworn
friendship till death.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXV )</p>
<p>TO MOSCOW</p>
<p>701</p>
<p>Alexander was now at Vilna, fifty-seven miles southeast of Kovno.
Sev- eral armies were awaiting his command: on the north 150,000 men
under Prince Mikhail Barclay de Tolly, of Scottish descent; on the south
60,000 under Prince Pyotr Bagration, a Georgian; on the east 40,000
under General Aleksandr Tormasov. They were no match for Napoleon’s
400,000 troops; but, in an orderly retreat, they could consume, destroy,
or cart away all usable provisions, and leave little for the invaders to
pillage. Another Russian army, 60,000 strong, freed by the peace with
Turkey, was marching up from the south under General Paul Chichagov; but
they were several days away.</p>
<p>On June 24 Alexander was the guest of honor at a bal champetre on the
estate of Count Levin Bennigsen, who had fought Napoleon to a draw at
Eylau in 1807. During the festivities a messenger brought to the Czar
word that the French were crossing the Niemen into Russia. Alexander
concealed the news till the fete was over. Returning to his
headquarters, he issued orders to his local armies to unite if possible,
but in any case to retreat into the interior. The French had come sooner
than expected; the Russian forces could not unite, but they retreated in
good order.</p>
<p>On June 26 the Czar sent to Napoleon an offer to reopen negotiations,
but only on condition that the French should at once leave Russia.
Putting little faith in his own proposal, he left Vilna with Barclay de
Tolly’s army for Vitebsk. There, at the persistent suggestion of his
officers that he was not equipped to determine military strategy, he
left for Moscow, and appealed to the citizens to sacrifice money and
blood in support of their invaded fatherland. They responded with
fervor, and he returned encouraged to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>On June 27 Napoleon and his main army began the long trek — 550 miles
— from Kovno to Moscow. Even those first days in Russia were an ordeal:
the days were hot, the nights were cold; a heavy rain drenched
everything. Each soldier carried with him food for five days, but to
spare or augment their supply, they pillaged the fields and cottages of
the countryside, regard- less of the Emperor’s prohibition. The army
reached Vilna on June 28, and plundered as much as they could before
Napoleon arrived. He came ex- pecting to be welcomed as a liberator;
some Poles and Lithuanians greeted him so; but some faced him in grim
silence, resenting robbery. 29 A deputa- tion asked him to pledge the
restoration of the Polish monarchy; he would not commit himself, fearing
to alienate the Prussians and Austrians in gov- ernment or in his army;
he asked the petitioners to defer the matter until his victorious return
from Moscow.</p>
<p>He had hoped to overtake and destroy one of the Czar’s armies at V
ilna, but Barclay and his men had escaped to Vitebsk, and Napoleon’s
forces were too weary to pursue him. Two weeks were spent in restoring
their order and spirit. Successive disappointments were sharpening the
Emperor’s temper.</p>
<p>702</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>army, was reproved by Napoleon for dilatory procedure and lax
leadership, resigned his command, and withdrew to his court in
Westphalia. 30 On July 1 6 Napoleon led his reprovisioned army out of
Vilna on a 250- mile march northeast to Vitebsk. He had planned to catch
up there with Bar- clay de Tolly, but that clever Scot was already
advanced on the road to Smolensk. Napoleon could not pursue him farther,
for he had ordered rein- forcements and supplies to reach him at
Vitebsk, and they were delayed. Several of his generals advised him to
camp there for the winter instead of trying to get to Moscow and back
before the snows came. Napoleon an- swered that Vitebsk was not situated
to allow successful fortification and defense; that the region was too
sparsely cultivated to feed his army; that any delay before reaching
Moscow, or a decisive battle, would give Russia time to form and equip
more armies to harass the French en route or block- ade them in Vitebsk;
nothing but the capture of Russia’s holy city and ancient capital would
bring Alexander to terms.</p>
<p>After fifteen days at Vitebsk he led his army out on August 13 in the
hope of catching Barclay at Smolensk. This was the populous center of a
fertile region, favored, by its situation on the Dnieper, for commerce
and - industry, and so well fortified that Barclay and Bagration, having
united their forces there, had decided to make a stand and at least halt
Napoleon’s advance.</p>
<p>The French arrived on August 16, exhausted by their long marches, and
reduced by death and desertion to 160,000 men. 31 Nevertheless their
attack was violent and effective; by the night of August 17, whether by
Russian despair or French artillery, the city had been set on fire, much
to Napoleon’s aesthetic and martial delight. “Don’t you think this a
beautiful sight?” he asked his master of the horse. “Horrible, Sire,”
answered Caulaincourt. Na - poleon: “Bah! Remember what a Roman emperor
said: ‘The corpse of an enemy always smells sweet.’” 32 On August 18 the
Emperor sent to Maret, - lish historian, reckoned the French had lost
8-9,000 men, the Russians 6,ooo. 34 The French losses were
irretrievable; the Russian armies retreated into friendly towns and a
pool of conscriptible men.</p>
<p>On July 20 Czar Alexander, moved by the divisive views and tactics of
the Russian generals, decided that his armed forces needed a united com-
mand. He appointed to that post Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov (1745-</p>
<p>1813), who had earned a reputation for authoritative and successful
general- ship through many campaigns. He was sixty-seven years old, lazy
and sedentary, so fat that he had to be drawn about the camp or
battlefield in a carriage; he had lost one eye in battle, and the other
was ailing; he was slightly lecherous, and a bear with women; but he had
learned the art of war in fifty years of action; and all Russia had
clamored for his appoint- ment. He disappointed nearly everyone,
including Napoleon, by avoiding battle, and ordering further
retreat.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV) TO MOSCOW 703</p>
<p>Napoleon was tempted to abandon the chase, make Smolensk a fortress
in the center of Russia, spend the winter there, and maintain an armed
line of communication with Western Europe. But now he found himself in*
a completely unexpected situation: his army was so disordered by racial
fac- tion and the breakdown of discipline that he felt safer on the
march, where the fear of an attack compelled cohesion. “This army,” he
told General Sebastiani, “cannot now stop;… motion alone keeps it
together. One may go forward at the head of it, but neither halt nor go
back.” 35 So, shortly after midnight of August 25, only a week after its
capture, he and his troops left Smolensk on the hot and dusty road to
Viazma,’ Gzhatsk… and Moscow — three weeks away. Murat and his cavalry
rode at their head, heartening morale by the gay recklessness with which
he and his cavaliers fought back any attack from the rear guard of the
retreating Russians. Na- poleon later described him:</p>
<p>He was only brave in the presence of the enemy; in that case the
bravest man in the world. His impetuous courage carried him into the
midst of danger. Then he was decked out in gold and feathers that rose
above his head like a church tower. He escaped continually, as by a
miracle, for he was easily recognized by his dress. He was a regular
target for the enemy, and the Cossacks used to admire him on account of
his astonishing bravery. 36</p>
<p>On September 5, as they approached the town of Borodino (still
seventy- five miles from Moscow), the French vanguard, reaching the top
of a hill, saw in the plain ahead a sight that gladdened and saddened
them: hundreds of Russians completing redoubts within which artillery
could be concealed, and farther in the fields, near the confluence of
the Rivers Kalacha and Moskva, thousands of soldiers; apparently Kutuzov
had decided to make a stand.</p>
<p>All through September 6 the rival hosts prepared for battle. On that
cold, wet night hardly anyone slept. At 2 a. m. Napoleon sent out a
proclamation, to be read, in translation, to the various divisions of
his army: “Soldiers! Behold the battle that you have so long desired.
Now the victory depends upon you. It is indispensable. It will give us
abundance, good winter quar- ters, and an early return to our
fatherland.” 37 That night, by order of Kutuzov, the priests who
accompanied his army carried through his camp an icon of the “Black
Virgin,” which had been rescued from burning</p>
<p>Smolensk; the soldiers knelt, made the sign of the cross, and
responded with fervor to the priests’ repeated prayer “Gospodi pomilui —
Lord have mercy,” and Kutuzov bent to kiss the icon. 38</p>
<p>About that time a courier brought Napoleon a letter from Marie
Louise, with a recent portrait of their one-year-old son. Also the news
was brought to him that his army had suffered a critical defeat by
Wellington at Sala- manca. He spent much of the night issuing directions
to his officers for the morrow’s tactics. It must have been difficult
for him to sleep, for his habitual dysuria pained him; his urine was
alarmingly discolored, his legs were swollen with dropsy, his pulse was
weak and frequently missed a beat. 39</p>
<p>704 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>Despite these discomforts he exhausted three horses on the first day
of bat- tle, riding from one part of his army to the other. 40</p>
<p>■ He had 130,000 tired men under him, Kutuzov 112,000; the French had
587 guns, the Russians 640. All through September 7 these thousands of
men, fearing, hating, killing, dying, fought their like with heroism and
tenacity equal on either side, as if feeling that the destiny of Europe
depended upon them. Bagration gave his life in leading a Russian charge;
Caulaincourt, in this war that he had sought to prevent, lost a beloved
brother; Eugandandandandne, Davout, Murat faced death a hundred times;
Ney on that field won from Napoleon the fond title of Prince of the
Moskva. Victory passed with seem- ing indifference from one side to the
other all that day. When night fell the Russians slowly gave ground; the
French remained masters of the field, but Napoleon reckoned victory far
from certain. Kutuzov sent to Alexander a proud report that allowed the
cathedrals of St. Petersburg and Moscow to raise a Te Deum to their God.
The French had lost 30,000 men killed or disabled, the Russians 50,ooo.
41</p>
<p>At first, on September 8, Kutuzov thought of renewing the battle, but
as the figures for his losses came in he felt that he could not subject
the sur- vivors to another day of such slaughter. He resumed his policy
of retreat, and henceforth kept it to the end. On September 1 3 he
ordered the evacu- ation of Moscow, and on the 14th he set out grimly
toward new uncertain- ties.</p>
<p>On that day Napoleon and his 95,000 survivors 42 reached the gates of
Moscow, after a march of eighty-three days from Kovno. A message from
General Miloradovich, head of the Moscow garrison, asked for a
cease-fire while he led out his men; it was granted. Napoleon waited for
notables to present themselves and ask for his protection; none came.
When he entered the city he observed that none of the inh abitants
remained except “a few thousand people belonging to the lower classes.”
43 Some harlots had stayed, hoping for francs, and soon willing to agree
for food and shelter. Napoleon had brought a load of counterfeit Russian
bank notes; the Russians refused to accept them; the notes had to be
burned. 44 The victors searched the city, pillaged the palaces, sacked
the estates in the hinterland; they loaded them- selves with wine and
heirlooms; the latter were destined to be shed, one after another, on
the retreat.</p>
<p>On September 15 Napoleon moved into the Kremlin, and waited for
Alexander to sue for peace. On that evening Moscow began to bum.</p>
<p>V. THE BURNING OF MOSCOW: SEPTEMBER 1 5 — 19, l8l2</p>
<p>Napoleon marveled at the beauty of the deserted city. “Under every
point of view,” he told Las Cases, “it might bear comparison with any of
the capitals of Europe; the greater number of them it surpassed.” 45 It
was Russia’s largest city, its Holy City or spiritual capital, with 340
churches</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV )</p>
<p>TO MOSCOW</p>
<p>705</p>
<p>coloring the sky with their bulging domes. Most of these churches
survived the fire, being built of stone. Dwellings were nearly all of
wood; 11,000 of these were destroyed, including 6,000 built of
“fireproof” materials.</p>
<p>Some fires were seen by the entering French, who ran to extinguish
them, but new fires sprang up, and spread so rapidly that they turned
the night of September 1 5 into day, and wakened by their light the
valets who guarded Napoleon’s sleep. They roused him; he ordered the
army’s fire brigade into action, then went back to bed. On. the morning
of the 16th, Murat and Eugene, fearing that a spark might ignite the
powder magazines that the army had deposited in the Kremlin, begged
Napoleon to leave the city. After much resistance he rode out with them
to a suburban palace, followed by wagons bearing records and materiel.
The fire subsided on September 1 8, after destroying two thirds of
Moscow, and Napoleon returned to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Who was responsible? The city authorities, before departing, had re-
leased the prisoners, 40 and these may have set the first fires in the
course of their looting. Some French soldiers may have been similarly
careless in their pillaging. 47 Many reports were brought to Napoleon on
September 16 that torchbearers were scattering through Moscow,
deliberately setting fires; he ordered that captured incendiaries be
shot or hanged; these orders were car- ried out. One arsonist, a Russian
military policeman, caught setting a fire in a turret of the Kremlin,
alleged that he had acted under orders. He was inter- viewed by
Napoleon, was taken down into the courtyard, and killed. 48 Sev- eral
arrested Russians alleged that the departing governor of the city, Count
Rostopchin, had given orders that the city be burned. 49</p>
<p>On September 20 Napoleon wrote to Alexander:</p>
<p>The proud and beautiful city of Moscow is no more. Rostopchin has had
it burned. Four hundred incendiaries were arrested in the very act; they
all de- clared that they set fire to the place by order of the Governor,
the Director of the Police. They have been shot. Three houses out of
every four have been burned down…. Such a deed is as useless as it is
atrocious. Was it intended to deprive us of provisions? These were in
cellars that the fire could not reach. Besides, what a trifling object
for which to destroy the work of centuries, and one of the most lovely
cities in the world! I cannot possibly believe that, with your
principles, your feelings, and your ideas of what is right, you can have
authorized excesses so unworthy of a just sovereign and a great
nation.</p>
<p>I made war on your Majesty without any hostile feelings. A single
letter from you, before or after the last battle, would have stopped any
advance, and I would willingly have surrendered the advantage of
occupying Moscow. If your Majesty still retains some part of your old
feelings for me, you will take this letter in good part. In any case you
cannot but agree that I was right in reporting what is happening in
Moscow. 60</p>
<p>Alexander did not answer this letter, but he answered the Russian
officer who had been assigned to announce to him the burning of Moscow.
The Czar asked if the event had hurt the morale of Kutuzov’s army. The
officer answered that the only fear of the army was that the Czar would
make</p>
<p>706</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>peace with Napoleon. Alexander, we are told, replied, “Tell my brave
men that when I have been reduced to one soldier I shall put myself at
the head of my nobility and my peasants. And if it is fated that my
dynasty must cease to reign, I shall let my beard grow to my breast, and
shall go and eat potatoes in Siberia rather than sign the shame of my
country and my good subjects.” 51</p>
<p>The people of Russia applauded his resolution, for the capture and
burn- ing of Moscow shocked them to the depths of their religious faith.
They reverenced Moscow as the citadel of their creed; they looked upon
Napo- leon as an unscrupulous atheist, and believed that his imported
savages had burned the holy city. They held Alexander guilty for having
accepted friendship with such a man. At times they feared that this
living devil would take St. Petersburg too, and slaughter millions of
them. Some of the nobility, thinking that at any moment Napoleon might
summon their serfs to free- dom, favored a compromise to get him out of
Russia; but the majority of Alexander’s entourage urged him to
resistance. The foreign group around him — Stein, Arndt, Mme. de Stael,
and a dozen emigres — daily pleaded with him; as the struggle proceeded
he came to see himself as the leader not only of his country but of
Europe, Christianity, civilization. He refused to answer any of the
three messages sent to him from Moscow by Napoleon offering peace. As
the Russian aristocracy saw week after week pass without any further
action by Napoleon, they began to understand the wisdom of Kutuzov’s
deadly inaction, and adjusted themselves to a long war. Again the
palaces of the capital gleamed with countesses in jeweled robes, and
officers in proud uniforms, moving confidently in stately dances to
music that had never felt the Revolution.</p>
<p>After the fire had been extinguished Napoleon ordered his men to care
for the injured or destitute survivors, of whatever ethnic origin , 52
and made arrangements for the storage or orderly consumption of victuals
left by the departing citizens. He answered the messages or inquiries
brought to him by couriers from his subject lands; later he boasted that
during his stay in Moscow not one of his couriers — and they averaged
one a day — had been intercepted by the enemy on their route. 53 He
reorganized and reequipped his army, and tried to keep it fit by
frequent drills; but the spirit had gone out of such parades. He had
concerts and plays presented by French musicians and actors who had been
domiciled in Moscow , 54 and found time to draw up a detailed order for
the reorganization and operation of the Comedie- Frangaise in Paris.</p>
<p>A month passed, but no word came from Alexander. “I beat the Russ
ians every time,” Napoleon complained, “but that does not get me
anywhere.” 55 September cooled into October; soon the Russian winter
would come. Finally, having lost hope of any answer from the Czar, or
any challenge from Kutuzov, and realizing that every day made his
situation worse, he surrendered to the bitter decision: to go back,
emptyhanded, or with a few solacing trophies, to Smolensk, Vilna,
Warsaw… Paris. What victory could ever wipe out the shame of this
defeat?</p>

<p>TO MOSCOW</p>
<p>707</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE WAY BACK: OCTOBER 19- NOVEMBER 28, l8l2</li>
</ol>
<p>One hope remained. Kutuzov had accumulated provisions at Kaluga,
ninety miles southwest of Moscow. Napoleon thought of marching there,
and forcing the wily general to battle for those stores; if the French
won decisively the Russian nobles might compel Alexander to sue for
peace. Moreover, Kaluga was on another road to Smolensk than that by
which the invaders had come; it would spare the pain of passing through
Borodino, where so many of their mates had died. The order went out:
prepare to evacuate.</p>
<p>So, on October 19, Napoleon’s army— 50,000 soldiers, 50,000 noncom-
batants — began to file out from Moscow. Baggage carts contained
provisions for twenty days; by that time they could reach Smolensk,
where fresh sup- plies had been ordered for them. 56 Other wagons bore
the sick or wounded, some heavy trophies, and Napoleon’s diminishing
supply of gold.</p>
<p>At Maloyaroslavets, twenty-five miles north of Kaluga, the French
made contac t with Kutuzov’s army. A sharp action followed (October 24),
which forced the Russians to withdraw behind their defenses in Kaluga.
Napoleon decided that his army was not equipped for a long siege.
Reluctantly he bade his men take the road via Borovsk and Mozhaisk to
Borodino. Thence they retraced the route they had followed in the
summertime of their hopes. Now, however, that devil of a Kutuzov brought
up his army to march on a parallel route to theirs, keeping elusively
out of sight, but sending up, now and then, cavalry detachments of wild
Cossacks to harass the French flanks; and happy peasants took shots at
stragglers who ventured too far from the sixty-mile line of march.
57</p>
<p>Napoleon was well protected, but only from immediate danger. Couriers
brought him, en route, news of active dissension threatening his
government in Paris, and rising rebellions in his subject lands. On
October 26, a week out of Moscow, he asked Caulaincourt should he,
Napoleon, leave at once for Paris to face and control the discontent
aroused by his defeat, and to raise a new army to defend the French
forces left in Prussia and Austria. Caulain- court advised him to go. 58
On November 6 word came that Claude-Fran9ois de Malet, a general in the
French Army, had overthrown the French gov- ernment on October 22, and
had won the support of prominent individuals, but had been deposed and
shot (October 29). Napoleon resolved to go.</p>
<p>As the retreat progressed the weather worsened. Snow fell on October
29; soon it would form a permanent cover, beautiful and blinding,
turning, in the cold of the night, to ice on which many dray horses
slipped and fell. Some were too exhausted to rise again, and had to be
abandoned; farther on the march such victims were eaten by starving
troops. Most officers kept their mounts alive by care and covering. The
Emperor rode part of the time in his carriage with Marshal Berthier, but
two or three times a day, or more often, according to Meneval, he walked
with the rest. 58</p>
<p>708</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>On November 1 3 the army, now reduced to a total of fifty thousand
men, began to enter Smolensk. They were furious on finding that most of
the food and clothing which Napoleon had ordered had been lost through
Cos- sack raids and local peculation; so a thousand oxen marked for the
army had been sold to merchants, who had resold them to any buyer. 60
The warriors fought for the remaining supplies, and took by force
whatever they could lay their hands on in the markets.</p>
<p>Napoleon had hoped to give his men a long rest at Smolensk, but word
came that Kutuzov was approaching with 80,000 Russians who were no
longer willing to retreat. Against them Napoleon could find only some
25,000 of his men who were fit to fight. 61 On November 14 he led part
of his forces out on the road to Krasnoe, by a different route to Vilna
than the one they had taken in the summer. Davout was to follow on the 1
5th, Ney on the 1 6th. The road was hilly and covered with ice; the
horses, not prop- erly shod for a Russian winter, slipped back on the
hills; after several such defeats hundreds of them resisted all efforts
to get them up, and accepted death as one of life’s mercies; and many of
the men took the same exit. “All along our way,” one veteran recalled,
“we were forced to step over the dead or dying.” 62 In descending those
icy hills no one dared to ride, or even to walk; all, including the
Emperor, took them sitting down, as a few of them had done in crossing
the Alps to Marengo twelve years before. These were days that counted
for years in the aging of master and men. It was appar- ently at this
point that Napoleon persuaded Dr. Yvan to give him a vial of poison to
carry with him in case he should be captured or for some other reason
might wish to end his life.</p>
<p>They reached Krasnoe on November 15, but could not rest; Kutuzov was
approaching with an overwhelming force; Napoleon bade his men to march
on to Orsha. Eugene led the way, fighting off desultory bands; the
Emperor and Davout followed. They reached Orsha after three more days of
march- ing on the ice; and there they waited anxiously for Ney to bring
up the third part of the French forces.</p>
<p>Ney was the bright star of the army at this time, as he had been at
Boro- dino. As commander of the rear guard he had led his seven thousand
men through a dozen battles to protect the retreat from attacks by
Kutuzov’s raiders. He and his division entered Smolensk late on November
15, and were shocked to discover that so little food had been left there
by the de- parted divisions under Napoleon and Davout. They managed to
survive, and hurried on to Krasnoe. There they found not Napoleon as
promised, but Kutuzov, blocking their way with murderous barrages of
artillery. Under cover of the night (November 18-19) Ney guided his
troops along a frozen stream to the fever Dnieper, crossed it at some
loss in men and horses, and fought his way through Cossacks and over
frozen marshes to reach Orsha on November 20. There Napoleon and the
waiting divisions welcomed the famished heroes with praise and food.
Napoleon embraced Ney, called him “the bravest of the brave,” and later
said: “I have four hundred million in</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXV)</p>
<p>TO MOSCOW</p>
<p>709</p>
<p>gold in the cellars of the Tuileries; I would gladly have given all
of it to see Marshal Ney again.” 03</p>
<p>To distance Kutuzov’s slower masse s the French hurried on through
four days’ march to face their next hurdle, the River Berezina. When
they reached it (November 25) they found that General Chichagov had come
up from the south with 24,000 men, and that another Russian force,
34,000 strong, under Marshal Ludwig Wittgenstein, was hurrying down from
the north to catch the French between two fires just when they were in
such disorder that their leaders despaired of saving them from
destruction.</p>
<p>Not all the news was bad. Napoleon soon learned that two friendly
forces had come to help him. A division of Poles under General Jan
Henryk Dombrowski, though outnumbered three to one, had challenged
Chichagov and delayed the Russian advance; and on November 23 a French
force of</p>
<p>8.000 men under Marshal Oudinot had surprised Chichagov, captured one
of his battalions, and driven the remainder in flight across a bridge at
Borisov to the right, or western, bank of the southward-flowing
Berezina. The Rus- sians, however, had destroyed the bridge, the only
one that spanned the river in that locality.</p>
<p>News of these operations reached Napoleon as his weary host — now</p>
<p>25.000 soldiers and 24,000 noncombatants — neared the stream which,
they hoped, would deter Kutuzov’s further pursuit. He too had lost men,
by desertion, illness, or death; only 27,000 remained of the 97,000 that
had started with him from Kaluga; and now they were forty miles behind
Na- poleon’s rear guard. There was still time to cross the river if it
could be</p>
<p>Regaining hope, Napoleon sent a detachment under Marshal Victor to go
north and stop Wittgenstein, and another under Ney to join Oudinot in
preventing Chichagov from recrossing the river. Ever since crossing the
Niemen, Napoleon had kept, as part of his staff, the engineers who had
built the bridges there in June; now he asked them to find a spot on the
Berezina over which they could raise two pontoon bridges. They found
such a spot at Studenki, nine miles north of Borisov. They and their
assistants worked through two days in the freezing waters. Ice floes
battered them, and sev- eral of them were drowned; but by one o’clock on
the afternoon of the 26th one bridge was ready, and the army began to
pass over it; by four o’clock another bridge was carrying over artillery
and other heavy loads. Napoleon and his generals waited till most of the
soldiers had reached the west bank; then they crossed over, leaving a
force under Victor to protect some 8,000 noncombatants who had still to
cross. Before that final operation could suc- ceed, the Russians
concerted an attack along both sides of the river; they were repulsed by
Victor, Oudinot, and Ney. Napoleon organized the cross- ing and the
resistance as well as he could in the confusion of thousands of men
struggling to survive. Twice a bridge broke down; hundreds were drowned;
meanwhile Wittgenstein’s artillery rained cannon shot upon the final
thousands crowding to cross. On November 29, to delay pursuit of his</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXV</p>
<p>men by the forces of Wittgenstein and the arriving Kutuzov, Napoleon
ordered his sappers to destroy both bridges, leaving hundreds of noncom-
batants still pleading for a chance to cross. All in all, the escape
across the Berezina was the most heroic episode in six months of costly
fantasies and miscalculations by one of the greatest generals in
history.</p>
<p>The tragedy continued as the survivors resumed their westward march.
The temperature again fell below the freezing point, but this had one
ad- vantage — it allowed travel over frozen marshes, shortening the
distance to Vilna. Fear of Cossacks and hostile peasants having
subsided, deserters mul- tiplied, and discipline disappeared.</p>
<p>Napoleon saw that he was now of little use to the remnant. He
listened agreeably to Murat’s advice to return to Paris lest France
succumb again to revolution. At the next main stop, Molodechno, he
received more details of the Malet affair. This usurper had been snuffed
out, but the ease with which he had imposed upon officials indicated a
lax government losing faith in a Napoleon so long absent, apparently
demolished, perhaps dead. Jacobins and royalists, Fouche and Talleyrand,
were plotting to depose him.</p>
<p>To reassert himself, and reassure the French people, he dispatched
from Smorgonie, on December 5, Bulletin No. 29, which differed from its
prede- cessors in almost telling the truth. The French, it said, had won
every battle, had taken every city on their march, had ruled Moscow;
however, the merci- less Russian winter had ruined the great enterprise,
and had inflicted pain and death upon civilized Frenchmen accustomed to
a civilized climate. The bul- letin admitted the loss of fifty thousand
men, but it proudly told the story of Ney’s escape from Kutuzov, and
presented the crossing of the Berezina in its heroic rather than its
tragic aspect. The message concluded, as if in warn- ing to his enemies:
“His Majesty’s health has never been better.”</p>
<p>Neverthless, he was worried to the core of his pride. He told
Caulain- court, “I can hold my grip on Europe only from the Tuileries.”
64 Murat, Eugene, and Davout agreed with him. He transferred his
authority over the marching army to King Murat, and told him to expect
provisions and rein- forcements at Vilna. Late on the evening of
December 5 he left Smorgonie for Paris.</p>
<p>The caravan, reduced to 35,000 troops, departed on the next day for
Vilna, forty-six miles away. Now the temperature fell to thirty degrees
be- low zero Fahrenheit, and the wind, said a survivor, cut through
flesh and bone. 65 Arrived at Vilna (December 8), the famished soldiers
rushed in primitive chaos upon the supplies awaiting them, and much food
was lost in the confusion. They resumed their march, and on December 13,
at Kovno, they crossed, 30,000 in number, the same Niemen which had seen
400,000 of them, there and at Tilsit, cross in June. At Posen, Murat,
worried in his turn about his throne, resigned his command to Eugene
(January 16, 1813), and hurried across Europe to Naples. Eugene, now
thirty years old, young but experienced, took charge of the remnant, and
led it patiently, day after</p>

<p>day, to the banks of the Elbe, where he awaited his adoptive father’s
com - mand.</p>
<p>Napoleon rode from Smorgonie in the first of three carriages,
each</p>
<p>mounted on a sleigh and drawn by two horses. One of the vehicles
carried friends and aides of the Emperor; another bore an escort of
Polish lancers. Napoleon rode with Caulaincourt, who arranged relays of
horses, and with General Wonsowicz, who acted as interpreter. To him
Napoleon handed two pistols, saying, “In case of rea l danger kill me
rather than let me be taken.” 86 Fearing capture or assassination, he
disguised himself by exchang - ing costumes with Caulaincourt. “Passing
through Poland,” Caulaincourt recalled, “it was always I who was the
distinguished traveler, an d the Em- peror was simply my secretary.”
67</p>
<p>The ride to Paris was continuous, night and day. The longest stop was
at Warsaw, where Napoleon surprised the French representative, the Abbe
de Pradt, with a now proverbial remark: “From the sublime to the
ridiculous is but a step.” 68 He wished to make another visit— to the
Countess Walewska; but Caulaincourt dissuaded him, 69 perhaps reminding
him that his father-in- law was also an emperor. On the ride from Warsaw
to Dresden, says Caulaincourt, Napol eon “praised the Empress Marie
Louise constantly, tell - ing of his home life with a feeling and
simplicity that did one good to hear.”</p>
<p>At Dresden Napoleon and Caulaincourt released their sleigh and their
Polish escort, and transferred to the closed carriage of the French
ambassa- dor. They reached Paris late on December 1 8 , after thirteen
days of almost continuous travel. Napoleon went directly to the
Tuileries, made himself known to the palace guards, and sent a message
to announce him to his wife; just before midnight he “rushed to the
Empress’ bedroom and clasped her in his arms.” 70 He dispatched a
messenger to Josephine, assuring her that her son was safe; and warmed
his heart with the sight of the curlyheaded infant whom he had named the
King of Rome.</p>
