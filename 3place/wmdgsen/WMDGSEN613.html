<h4 id="chapter-xviii-science-in-england">CHAPTER XVIII Science in
England</h4>
<p>I. AVENUES OF PROGRESS</p>
<p>I T was natural that England, having led the way from agriculture to
in- dustry, should favor those sciences that offered practical
possibilities, leaving theoretical studies to the French; and it was to
be expected that her philosophers in this period — Burke, Malthus,
Godwin, Bentham, Paine- should be men of the world, facing the living
problems of morality, religion, population, revolution, and government,
and abandoning to German profes- sors the airy flights into logic, me
taphysics, and the “phenomenology of mind.”</p>
<p>“The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge,” as
organized in 1660, had announced its “designs of founding a Colledge for
the promotion of Physico- Mathematical Experimentall Learning.” But i t
had not become a college in the sense of an organization of teachers for
the secondary education of youth; it had developed into a restricted
club of fifty-five gentlemen scientists, periodically meeting for
consultation, gather- ing a library of science and philosophy, providing
a special audience for ad- dresses and experiments, awarding medals for
contributions to science, and occasionally publishing its Philosophical
Transactions. “Philosophy” still included the sciences, which were
budding from it one by one as they replaced logic and theory with
quantitative formulations and verifiable ex- periments. The Royal
Society arranged, usually with governmental subsi- dies, various
scientific undertakings or expeditions. In 1780 the government assigned
to it elegant quarters in Somerset House, where it remained till 1857,
when it moved to its present home in Burlington House, on Piccadilly.
Its president from 1778 to 1820, Sir Joseph Banks, spent much of his
for- tune in the promotion of science and the patronage of
scientists.</p>
<p>Only less famous than the Royal Society, and more designed for educa-
tion, was the Royal Institution of London, established in 1800 by Count
Rumford, “for directing, by regular courses of philosophical lectures
and experiments, the application of the new discoveries in science to
the improve- ments of arts and manufactures.” It provided, in Albemarle
Street, a spacious auditorium where John Dalton and Sir Humphry Davy
gave lectures in chemistry, Thomas Young on the nature and propagation
of light, Coleridge on literature, Sir Edwin Landseer on art… More
specific were the Lin- naean Society, incorporated in 1802 for botany,
the Geographical Society ( 1 807), and soon thereafter societies for
zoology, horticulture, animal chem- istry, and astronomy. Manchester and
Birmingham, happy to apply science to their industries, established
their own “philosophical” societies, and Bristol set up a “Pneumatic
Institute” for the study of gases. Academies were</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN ENGLAND</p>
<p>387</p>
<p>formed to expound science to general audiences; to one of these
Michael Faraday, aged twenty-five (1816), gave a course of lectures that
shared for half a century in stimulating electrical research. Generally,
in scientific edu- cation, the business community was ahead of the
universities, and many epochal advances in science were made by
independent individuals seli- supported or financed by friends.</p>
<p>Surrendering mathematics to the French, British science concentrated
on astronomy, geology, geography, physics, and chemistry. Astronomy was
placed under royal protection and subsidies, as vital to navigation and
con- trol of the seas. Greenwich Observatory, with the finest equipment
that the money of Parliament could buy, was generally recognized as at
the top of its class. James Hutton, two years before his death,
published in 1795 Theory of the Earth, a classic in geology: it
summarized our p lanet’s public life as a uniform cyclical process by
which rains erode the surface of the land, rivers rise with erosions or
bear them to the sea, the waters and moisture of the earth evaporate
into clouds, these condense into rain… At the other end of this age
(1815) William Smith — nicknamed “Strata Smith”— won fame with the
fifteen immense sheets of his Geological Map of England and Wales. They
showed that strata regularly slant eastward in a slight ascending grade
until they end at the earth’s surface; and they advanced paleontology by
identifying strata according to their organic deposits. For revealing
such sub- terranean secrets the British government, in 1831, awarded him
a life annuity of £ 100. He died in 1839.</p>
<p>British navigators continued to explain the nooks and crannies of
lands and seas. In the years 1791-94 George Vancouver charted the coasts
of Aus- tralia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and the Pacific Northwest of
America; there he circumnavigated the enchanting island that bears his
name.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>physics: rumford and young</li>
</ol>
<p>It is difficult to place nationally the Benjamin Thompson who was
born (1753) and reared in America, knighted in England, and made Count
Rum- ford in Bavaria, and who died in France ( 18 14). In the War of
American In- dependence he sided with Britain, and moved to London
(1776). Sent back to serve as British secretary in the colony of
Georgia, his interest overflowed from politics to science, and he made
researches which won him a fellow- ship in the Royal Society. In 1784,
with the permission of the British govern- ment, he entered the service
of Bavaria under Prince Maximilian Joseph. In the next eleven years, as
Bavarian minister of war and police, he reorga- nized the Army, improved
the condition of the working class, ended mendi- cancy, and found time
to contribute papers for the Philosophical Transac- tions of the Royal
Society. The grateful Maximilian made him (1791) a count of the Holy
Roman Empire; he took for his title the name of his wife’s birthplace
(now Concord) in Massachusetts. During a year in Britain (1795) he
labored to better the heating and cooking arrangements of the</p>
<p>388</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>people, with a view to reducing domestic pollution of the air. After
another year of service in Bavaria, he returned to England, and, with
Sir Joseph Banks, established the Royal Institution. He founded — and
was the first to receive — the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society. He
provided funds for the award of a similar medal by academies of arts and
sciences in Bavaria and America, and for the Rumford professorship in
Harvard University. After the death of his wife he moved to Paris
(1802), took a house in Auteuil, mar- ried the widow of Lavoisier, and
remained in France despite the renewal of war with England. Active to
the end, he labored, in his final year, to feed with “Rumford soup” the
French populace nearing destitution as Napoleon, taking all available
sons, marched to his doom.</p>
<p>Rumford’s contributions to science were too varied and incidental to
be spectacular, but, taken altogether, they formed a remarkable
counterpoint to a busy administrative life. While watching the boring of
cannon in Mu- nich he was struck by the heat which the operation
produced. To measure this he arranged to have a solid metal cylinder
rotate with its head against a steel borer, all in a watertight box
containing eighteen and three-quarter pounds of water. In two and
three-quarter hours the temperature of the water rose from 60 degrees
Fahrenheit to 212 degrees — the boiling point. “It would be difficult,”
Rumford later recalled, “to describe the astonishment expressed in the
countenances of the bystanders on seeing so large a quantity of water
heated, and actually made to boil, without any fire.” 1 This experi -
ment proved that heat was not a substance but a mode of molecular motion
roughly proportioned in degree to the amount of work done to produce it.
This belief had been held long before, but Rumford’s device provided its
first experimental proof, and a method of measuring the mechanical
equiva- lent of heat — i.e., the amount of work required to heat one
pound of water</p>
<p>Thomas Young was almost as “undulant and diverse” as Rumford and
Montaigne. Born (1773) of Quaker parentage in Somerset, he began with
religion, and then passed, with undiminished devotion, to science. At
the age of four, we are assured, he had read the Bible through twice,
and at fourteen he could write in fourteen languages. 2 At twenty-one he
was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; at twenty-six he was an
established physician in London; at twenty-eight he was teaching physics
in the Royal Institution; and in 1801 he began there the experiments
that confirmed and developed Huyghens’ conception of light as
undulations of a hypothetical ether. After much debate this view
generally — not universally — displaced Newton’s theory of light as the
emanation of materia l corpuscles. Young also offered the hypothesis,
later developed by Helmholtz, that the percep- tion of color depends
upon the presence in the retina of three kinds of nerve fibers,
respectively responsive to red, violet, and green. For good measure he
gave the first descriptions of astigmatism, blood pressure, capillary
attraction, and tides, and shared actively (1814) in the decipherment of
the Rosetta Stone. He was, said a learned historian of medicine, “the
most highly edu -</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII ) SCIENCE IN ENGLAND 389</p>
<p>cated physician of his time,” and, added Helmholtz, “one of the most
clear - sighted men who ever lived.” 3</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>CHEMISTRY: DALTON AND DAVY</li>
</ol>
<p>In that same decade, and also at the Royal Institution, John Dalton
revo- lutionized chemistry with his atomic theory (1804). Son of a
Quaker weaver, he was born ( 1766) at Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth, at
the north- ern end of that misty magnificent Lake District which was
soon to harbor Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. Later, writing in the
third person, he summarized his early career in a bald chronology that
does not quite hide the hot ambition that burns a path to
accomplishment:</p>
<p>The writer of this… attended the village school… till 11 years of
age, at which period he had gone through a course of Mensuration,
Surveying, Navigation, etc.; began about 12 to teach the village
school;… was occasion- ally employed in husbandry for a year or more;
removed to Kendal at 15 years of age as assistant in a boarding school,
remained in that capacity for 3 or 4 years, then undertook the same
school as a principal, and continued for 8 years, and while at Kendal
employed his leisure in studying Latin, Greek, French, and the
Mathematics with Natural Philosophy, removed thence to Manchester in
1793 as Tutor in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the New College.
4</p>
<p>Whenever time and funds permitted he carried on observations and ex-
periments, despite color blindness and crude instruments, many of them
made by himself. Amid his many interests he found time to keep a
meteoro- logical record from his twenty-first year to a day before his
death. 5 His va- cations were usually spent foraging for facts in those
same mountains where Wordsworth would roam a few years later; however,
while Wordsworth was looking and listening for God, Dalton was, for
example, measuring at- mospheric conditions at different altitudes —
much as Pascal had done a cen- tury and a half before.</p>
<p>In his experiments he accepted the theory of Leucippus ( c. 450 b.c.)
and Democritus ( c. 400 b.c.) that all matter consists of indivisible
atoms; and he proceeded on the assumption of Robert Boyle (1627-91) that
all atoms be- long to one or another of certain ultimate indecomposable
elements — hydro- gen, oxygen, calcium… In A New System of Chemical
Philosophy (1808) Dalton argued that the weight of any atom of an
element, as compared with any atom of another element, must be the same
as the weight or a mass of the first element as compared with an equal
mass of the other. Taking the weight of a hydrogen atom as one, Dalton,
after many experiments and cal- culations, ranged each of the other
elements by the relative weight of any one of its atoms with an atom of
hydrogen; and so he drew up, for the thirty elements known to him, a
table of their atomic weights. In 1967 chemists recognized ninety- six
elements. Dalton’s conclusions had to be corrected by later research,
but they — and his complex “law of multiple proportions” in all</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>combinations of elements — proved of immense help in the progress of
the science in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>More varied and exciting were the life, education, and discoveries of
Sir Humphry Davy. Born in Penzance (1778) of a well-to-do middle-class
family, he received a good education, and supplemented it with
expeditions that combined geology, fishing, sketching, and poetry. His
happy nature won him a miscellany of friends, from Coleridge, Southey,
and Dr. Peter Roget — the ingenious and indefatigable compiler of the
Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (1852) — to Napoleon. Another
friend allowed him free use of a chemical laboratory, whose bubbling
retorts charmed Davy into dedication. He organized his own laboratory,
sampled diverse gases by in- haling them, persuaded Coleridge and
Southey to join his inhaling squad, and almost killed himself by
breathing water gas, a powerful poison.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-two he published an account of his experiments
as Researches Chemical and Philosophical (1800). Invited to London by
Count Rumford and Joseph Banks, he gave lectures and demonstrations on
the won- ders of the storage battery (Volta’s “pile”), bringing new fame
to the R oyal Institution. Using a battery of 250 pairs of metal plates
as an agent of elec- trolysis, he decomposed various substances into
their elements; so he dis- covered and isolated sodium and potassium;
soon he went on to isolate barium, boron, strontium, calcium, and
magnesium, and add them to the list of elements. His achievements
established electrochemistry as a science endless in its theoretical and
practical possibilities. The news of his work reached Napoleon, who sent
him in 1 806, across the frontiers of war, a prize awarded by the
Institut National. Berthollet in 1786 had explained to James Watt the
bleaching power of chlorine; England had been slow to use the
suggestion; Davy renewed it effectively. In him science and industry
devel- oped that mutual stimulation which was to play a leading role in
the eco- nomic transformation of Great Britain.</p>
<p>In 1810, before an audience at the Royal Institution, Davy performed
ex- periments demonstrating the power of an electric current, in passing
from one carbon filament to another, to produce both light and heat. He
de- scribed the operation:</p>
<p>When pieces of charcoal about an inch long and one-sixth of an inch
in diameter were brought near each other (within the thirtieth or
fortieth of an inch), a bright spark was produced, and more than half
the volume of the char- coal became ignited to whiteness; and, by
withdrawing the points from each other, a constant discharge took place
through the* heated air, in a space equal to at least four inches,
producing a most brilliant ascending arch of light…. When any substance
was introduced into this arch, it instantly became ignited; platina
melted as readily in it as wax in a common candle; quartz, the sap-
phire, magnesia, lime, all entered into fusion. 6</p>
<p>The potentialities of this process of generating light and heat were
not de- veloped until cheaper ways of producing electric current were
invented; but in that brilliant experiment lay the electric blast
furnace, and the trans- formation of night into day for half the
population of the earth.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>SCIENCE IN ENGLAND</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>In 1813, accompanied by his young assistant Michael Faraday, and
armed with a safe-conduct issued by Napoleon while nearly all Europe was
at war, Davy traveled through France and Italy, visiting laboratories,
making ex- periments, exploring the properties of iodine, and proving
that the diamond is a form of carbon. Returning to England, he studied
the causes of mine ex- plosions, and invented a safety lamp for miners.
In 1818 the Prince Regent made him a baronet. In 1820 he succeeded Banks
as president of the Royal Society. In 1827, his health having begun to
fail, he gave up science for fish- ing, and wrote a book thereon,
illuminated by his own drawings. In 1829, partly paralyzed, he went to
Rome to be “a ruin amongst ruins,” 7 but he died before the year was
out. He had been allowed only fifty-one years, but he had crowded many
lives into that half century. He was a good great man and one of those
redeeming men and women who must be weighed in the balance against our
ignorance and sins.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>BIOLOGY: ERASMUS DARWIN</li>
</ol>
<p>Biology did not, as yet, do as well in England as physics, chemistry,
and geography; these were akin and helpful to industry and commerce; but
biology revealed the tragedy as well as the splendor of life, and
troubled religious belief.</p>
<p>Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles, has already received our hom-
age,* but he was a spark in the brilliance of this age, since it saw the
publi- cation of his Botanic Garden (1792), Zoonomia (1794-96), and
The</p>
<p>Temple of Nature (1803). These books were all written from an
evolution- ary point of view. They agreed with Lamarck in basing the
theory upon the hope that adaptive habits and organs, developed by
desire and effort, might, if strengthened through many generations, be
written transmissibly upon nerves and flesh. The genial doctor, who bore
a great name fore and aft, sought to reconcile evolution with religion
by suggesting that all animal life had begun with “one living filament
which the first great Cause imbued with animality,” leaving it to
“improve by its own inherent activity, and to deliver down these
improvements by generation to posterity, world without end.” 8</p>
<p>The perennial debate between religion and science, though muted in
this age, entered into the once guarded realm of psychology as Hartley
and Priestley prepared a physiological interpretation of the association
of ideas, and as anatomists progressively revealed the correlation
between body and mind. In 18 11 Charles Bell published A New Idea of the
Anatomy of the Brain, in which he seemed to prove that specific parts of
the nervous system convey sense impressions to specific parts of the
brain, and specific nerves carry motor impulses to specific organs of
response. The phenomena of hyp- notism, increasingly abundant, seemed to
indicate a physiological trans-</p>

<p>formation of sensation into idea into action. The effects of opium
and other drugs in inducing sleep, affecting dreams, stimulating the
imagination and weakening the will (as in Coleridge and De Quincey)
further called in question the freedom of the will, reducing it to the
algebraic sum of compet- ing images or impulses. And the rising status,
scientific dispute, and social standing of the medical profession,
compared with the lowered status and reduced vitality of the Anglican
clergy, seemed to reflect the secret spread of religious indifference,
or doubt, or unbelief.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>medicine: jenner</li>
</ol>
<p>The medical fraternity hardly deserved that name, for it fully
reflected the British penchant for class or grade distinctions. The
Royal College of Physi- cians, proud of its establishment by Henry VIII
in 1518, limited its “associ - ate” memberships to some fift y men who
had taken a degree at Oxford or Cambridge, and its “licentiate”
memberships to about fifty other distin - guished practitioners. These
hundred men served as a kind of House of Lords to the medicos of
England. They earned substantial incomes, some- times as high as twenty
thousand pounds a year. They could not become peers, but they could be
knighted, and might aspire to a baronetcy. Of markedly lower status was
the Royal College of Surgeons, established in 1 800. Below these were
the accoucheurs, male midwives, who specialized in drawing embryos out
of their warm security into the competitive world. At the bottom of the
healers were the apothecaries, who provided nearly all the medical care
available in rural areas.</p>
<p>Neither of these “colleges” offered medical education except for occa
- sional lectures by famous physicians. Neither Oxford nor Cambridge had
a school of medicine; students who desired university training in
medicine had to seek it in Scotland. Otherwise the training of English
doctors was left to the private schools that grew in the neighborhood of
the great hospitals raised by private philanthropy. Sir Thomas Bernard
spent much of his wealth in reformin g the famous “Foundlings’ Hospital”
in the north of Lon - don, and shared with other wealthy men in
financing, in London and else- where, free clinics for the treatment of
cancer, ophthalmia, and hernia. But the poor sanitation of the cities
spread diseases, or generated new ones, as fast as medicine could cure
them.</p>
<p>In 1806 London recorded a singular event: it had gone a full week
with- out a death from smallpox — that pustulous, feverish,
face-marring, and in- fectious disease which had once been epidemic in
England, and might at any time swell again into a deadly plague.</p>
<p>A modest English physician, Edward Jenner — addicted to hunting,
botany, composing poetry, and playing the flute or the violin — made the
miracle week possible by a decade of inoculations that finally overcame
the con- servatism of British society. The prevention of smallpox by
inoculation with weakened virus from a smallpox-infected human being had
been practiced</p>

mary in the Constantinople of 1717; on her return to England she recom-
mended the procedure there. It was tried upon criminals, then upon
orphans, with considerable success. In 1760 Drs. Robert and Daniel
Sutton reported that in thirty thousand cases of smallpox inoculation
they had had twelve hundred fatalities. Could a surer method of
preventing smallpox be found?</p>
<p>Jenner was led to a better way by noting that many milkmaids in his
native Gloucestershire contracted cowpox from infected nipples of cows,
and that these women were thereafter immune to smallpox. It occurred to
him that a like immunity might be established by inoculating with a
vaccine (’ vacca is Latin for cow ) made from virus of a pox-infected
cow. In a paper published in 1798 Jenner recounted a venturesome
procedure which laid the foundations of experimental medicine and
immunology.</p>
<p>… I selected a healthy boy, about eight years old, for the purpose of
inocu- lation for [with] the Cow Pox. The matter was taken from a sore
on the hand of a dairymaid who was infected by her master’s cows, and it
was inserted, on</p>
<p>In order to acertain whether the boy, after feeling so slight an
affection of the system from the Cow Pox virus, was secure for the
contagion of the Small Pox, he was inoculated, the 1st of July
following, with variolous matter [variola is Latin for smallpox]
immediately taken from a pustule…. No dis- ease followed…. Several
months afterwards he was again inoculated with variolous matter, but no
sensible effect was produced in the constitution. 9</p>
<p>Jenner went on to describe twenty-two other cases of similar
procedure with completely satisfactory results. He met with condemnation
for what seemed to be human vivisection, and he tried to atone for using
a consenting minor by building a cottage for him and planting a rose
garden for him with his own hands. 10 In 1802 and 1807 Parliament voted
Jenner £ 30,000 to im- prove and spread his methods. In the course of
the nineteenth century small- pox almost disappeared from Europe and
America, and when it occurred it was in unvaccinated individuals.
Vaccination was applied to other ailments, and the new science of
immunology shared with other medical advances, and with public
sanitation, in giving modern communities as much health as is allowed by
the harassments of poverty, the fertility of ignorance, the reck-
lessness of appetite, and the patient inventiveness of disease.</p>
