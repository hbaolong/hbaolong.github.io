<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>The Crucible of Faith</p>
<p>1643-1715</p>
<p>I. THE KING AND THE CHURCH</p>
<p>T HE historian, like the journalist, tends to lose the normal
background of an age in the dramatic foreground of his picture, for he
knows that his readers will relish the exceptional and will wish to
personify processes and events. Behind the rulers, ministers, Qourtiers,
mistresses, and warriors of France were men and women competing for
bread and mates, scolding and loving their children, sinning and
confessing, playing and quarreling, going wearily to work, stealthily to
brothels, humbly to prayer. The quest for eternal salvation occasionally
interruped the struggle for daily survival; the dream of heaven grew as
the lust for life declined; the cool naves of the churches gave respite
from the heat of strife. The marvelous myths were the people’s poetry;
the Mass was the consoling drama of their redemption; and though the
priest himself might be a covetous worldling, the message he brought
lifted up the hearts of the defeated poor. The Church still rivaled the
state as a pillar of society and power, for it was through hope that men
submitted patiently to labor, law, and war.</p>
<p>The higher Catholic clergy knew their importance in the miracle of
order, and shared with the nobility and the King the revenues of the
nation and the splendor of the court. Bishops and archbishops associated
in polished intimacy with the Condes, the Montpensiers, and the
Sevignes; and a thousand abbes, half-ordained, half -married, flirted
with women and ideas. By and large, however, the mentality and morals of
the Catholic clergy — perhaps under the stimulus of competition from
Huguenot ministers — were better than for centuries before . 1</p>
<p>The nunneries were not the “hotbeds of vice” imagined by the</p>
<p>mythopoetic frenzy of religious hate. Many were retreats of sincere,
some- times ascetic piety, like the Carmelite convent to which Louise de
la Valliere retired. Some others served as havens for genteel young
women whose parents could find no husband or dowry for them, or who had
committed some offense, or had offended some potentate. In such
nunneries the inmates thought it no sin to receive a visitor from the
outisde world, to dance with one another, to read secular literature, or
to mitigate the tedium of their lives with billiards or cards. It was by
reforming such a convent</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>that Jacqueline Arnauld made Port-Royal the most famous nunnery in
the history of France.</p>
<p>Of the monastic orders we cannot speak so leniently; many of them had
relaxed their rules, and led lives of idleness, formal prayer, and
mendicant importunity. Armand Jean de Ranee reformed the Monastery of
Notre- Dame de la Trappe in Normandy, and established the austere
Trappist order that still silently survives. The Jesuit/ entered more
actively into the life and history of France. At the beginning of the
seventeenth century they were under a cloud as defenders of regicide; at
the end they were the confessors and guides of the King. They were
experts in psychology. When the nun Marguerite Marie Alacoque, inspired
by a mystic vision, founded (1675) the society devoted to the public
worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Jesuits encouraged the
movement as an outlet and stimulus for popular piety. At the same time
they made religion easier for sinners by recognizing the naturalness of
sin, and developing the science of casuistry as a means of mitigating
the difficulties of the Ten Commandments and the neuroses of remorse.
They were soon in demand as confessors, and gained authority as
“directors of conscience,” especially for the women who dominated French
society, and who sometimes influenced national policy.</p>
<p>The word “casuistry” did not have in the seventeenth century the</p>
<p>derogatory connotation left upon it by Pascal’s Provincial Letters.
As a confessor or spiritual director, every priest was expected to know
just what was to be considered a mortal sin, or a venial sin, or no sin
at all; and he had to be prepared to apply his knowledge, and adjust his
judgment, his counsel, and the penance, to the special circumstances of
the penitent and the case (casus). The rabbis had developed this art of
moral distinctions to great length in the legal portions of the Talmud;
modern jurisprudence and psychiatry have followed suit. Long before the
establishment of the Society of Jesus, Catholic theologians had drawn up
voluminous treatises on casuistry to guide the priest in moral doctrine
and confessional practice. In what cases might the letter of the moral
law be set aside for its spirit or intent? When might one lie or steal
or kill, or reasonably break a promise, or violate an oath, or even deny
the faith?</p>
<p>Some casuists demanded strict interpretation of the moral law, and
thought that in the long run severity would prove more beneficial than
laxity. Other casuists — especially the Jesuits Molina, Escobar, Toledo,
and Busenbaum — favored a lenient code. They urged that allowances
should be made for human nature, for environmental influences, for
ignorance of the law, for extreme hardship of literal compliance, for
the semi-insanity of transports of passion, and for any circumstances
that hindered the freedom of the will. To facilitate this complaisant
morality, the Jesuits developed the doctrine of probabilism — that where
any</p>
<p>4 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>recognized authority on moral theology favored a particular view, the
confessor might at his discretion judge in accordance with that view,
even though the majority of experts opposed it. (The word probabilis at
that time meant appro vable, admitting of approbation. 2 ) Moreover,
said some Jesuit casuists, it was sometimes permissible to lie, or to
withhold the truth by a “mental reservation”; so a captured Christian,
for ced to choose between Mohammedanism and death, might without sin
pretend to accept Islam. Again, said Escobar, the moral quality of an
action lies not in the deed itself, which in itself is amoral, but in
the moral intention of the agent; there is no sin unless there is a
conscious and voluntary departure from the moral law.</p>
<p>Much Jesuit casuistry was a reasonable and humane adjustment of</p>
<p>medievally ascetic rules to a society that had discovered the
legitimacy of pleasure. But in France especially, and to a lesser degree
in Italy, the Jesuits developed casuistry to such lenience with human
frailty that earnest men like Pascal in Paris and Sarpi in Venice, and
many Catholic theologians, including several Jesuits, 3 protested
against what seemed to them a sur- render of Christianity to sin. The
Huguenots of France, inheriting the rigorous code of Calvin, were
shocked by the Jesuit compromise with the world and the flesh. A
powerful movement within Catholicism itself — Jansenism — raised at the
convent of Port-Royal the flag of an almost Calvinistic ethic in an
anti-Jesuit war that agitated France, and French literature, for a
century. That war involved Louis XIV, for his confessors were Jesuits
and his practice was not puritan. In 1674 Pere La Chaise — “an even-
tempered man,” Voltaire described him, “with whom reconciliation was
always easy” 4 — took charge of the royal conscience. He occupied the
post for thirty- two years, forgiving everything and loved by all. “He
was so good,” said Louis, “that I sometimes reproached him for it.” 6
But in his quiet and patient way he had great influence over the King,
and helped to steer him to monogamy at last, and obedience to the
pope.</p>
<p>For Louis was not always a good “papist.” He was pi ous in his
official way, and rarely failed to attend daily Mass. 6 In his memoirs
he told his son:</p>
<p>Partly out of gratitude for all the good fortune I had received,</p>
<p>and partly to win the affection of my people . . . , I continued
the</p>
<p>exercises of piety in which my mother had brought me up. . . .
And</p>
<p>to tell you the truth, my son, we lack not only gratitude and
justice,</p>
<p>but prudence and good sense, when we fail in veneration of Him of</p>
<p>whom we are but the lieutenants. Our submission to Him is the rule
and example of that which is due to us. 7</p>
<p>This, however, did not include submission to the papacy. Louis
inherited the Gallican tradition — the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges
(1438) and the</p>
<p>CHAP, n)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Concordat of Francis I (1516) — which had established the right of
French kings to appoint the bishops and abbots of France, to determine
their in- come, and to appoint to all benefices in a diocese between the
death of its bishop and the installation of his successor. Louis held
that he was the vicar or representative of God in France, that his
submission to the pope (as also a divine viceroy) should be limited to
matters of faith and morals, and that the French clergy should obey the
king in all matters affecting the French state.</p>
<p>A part of the French clergy — the Ultramontanes — repudiated these
claims, and upheld the absolute authority of the popes over kings,
councils, and episcopal nominations; but the majority — the Gallicans —
defended the full independence of the king in temporal affairs, denied
the infallibility of the pope except in agreement with an ecumenical
council, and saw an advantage to the French clergy in evading the
dominance of Rome. The Prince de Conde declared it his opinion that if
it pleased the King to go over to Protestantism, the French clergy would
be the first to follow him. 8 In 1663 the Sorbonne — the faculty of
theology at the University of Paris — issued Six Articles emphatically
affirming the Gallican position. The French parlements took the same
stand, and supported Louis in claiming the right to determine which
papal bulls should be published and accepted in France. In 1678 Pope
Innocent XI protested against Gallicanism, and excom- municated the
archbishop of Toulouse for deposing an anti-Gallican bishop. The King
convoked an assembly of the clergy, nearly all chosen by him. In March,
1682, it reaffirmed the Six Articles of the Sorbonne, and drew up for
the assembly the famous Four Articles that almost divorced the French
Church from Rome.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The pope has jurisdiction in spiritual concerns, and has no</li>
</ol>
<p>authority to depose princes or release their subjects from
obedience.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Ecumenical councils are above the pope in authority.</p></li>
<li><p>The traditional liberties of the French Church are
inviolable.</p></li>
<li><p>The pope is infallible only when in accord with the council
of</p></li>
</ol>
<p>bishops.</p>
<p>Innocent declared the decisions of the assembly null and void, and
refused canonical institution to all new bishops who approved the
articles. Since Louis appointed only such candidates, some thirty-five
dioceses were without canonical bishops in 1688. But by that time age
and Mme. de Maintenon had mollified the King, and death had taken the
resolute pope. In 1693 Louis allowed his nominees to disavow the
articles; Pope Innocent XII recognized the royal right over episcopal
nominations; and Louis was again Rex Christianissimus, the Most
Christian King.</p>
<p>5 °</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PORT-ROYAL: 1204-1626</li>
</ol>
<p>The old war between Church and state was the least of the three</p>
<p>religious dramas that inflamed this reign. Deeper by far was the
conflict between the orthodox Catholicism of state and clergy and the
almost Protestant Catholicism of the Jansenists and Port-Royal; and
deepest and most tragical, the destruction of the Huguenots in France.
But what was Port-Royal, and why so much ado about it in French history?
It was a Cistercian nunnery situated some sixteen miles from Paris and
six miles from Versailles, on a low and marshy site in what Mme. de
Sevigne called “a dreadful valley, just the place in which to find
salvation.” 9 Founded about 1204, it barely survived a h undred
vicissitudes in the Hundred Years’ War and the Wars of Religion.
Discipline and membership fell; and probably the convent would have
disappeared from notice had it not fallen under the rule of Jacqueline
Amauld, and enlisted in its defense the pen of Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>Antoine Arnauld I (1560-1619) made history by his eloquence and his
fertility. In 1593, after Barriere’s attempt to assassinate Henry IV,
Arnauld addressed the Paris Parlement in an indignant demand for the
expulsion of the Jesuits from France. They never forgave him, and they
looked with critical and ominous eye upon the operations of his family
at Port-Royal. Of his twenty or more children at least four were
involved in the story of that convent. Jacqueline Arnauld was made
coadjutrix to the abbess of Port- Royal at the age of seven (1598), and
a year later her sister Jeanne, aged six, became abbess of St.-Cyr.
These nominations were made by Henry IV, and were confirmed by papal
bulls obtained through falsifying the ages of the girls. 10 Presumably
the father had sought these places for his daughters as an alternative
to finding husbands and dowries for them.</p>
<p>When Jacqueline, as Mere Angelique, became nominal abbess at Port-
Royal (1602), she found only the most genial discipline among the
thirteen nuns. Each had her own property, displayed her hair, used
cosmetics, and dressed in the fashion of the day. They took the
Sacrament infrequently, and had heard no more than seven sermons in
thirty years. 11 As she grew more conscious of the life to which her
parents had committed her, the young abbess became discontent, and
meditated flight (1607). “I thought of leaving Port-Royal and returning
to the world, without notifying my father or my mother, to escape this
unb earable yoke, and to be married.” 12 She fell ill, and was taken
home, where she was nursed by her mother with such tender care that, on
recovering, she returned to Port-Royal resolved, for love of her mother,
to keep her conventual vows. However, she</p>
<p>ordered a whalebone corset to’ keep her figure in fashionable bounds.
13 She remained secretly averse to the religious life until, at Easter
of 1608, now</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>5 1</p>
<p>in the full glow of puberty, she heard a sermon by a Capuchin monk on
the sufferings of Christ. “During this sermon,” she later reported, “God
touched me in such a way that from that moment I found myself happier in
the life of a nun . . . and I know not what I would not have done for
God if He had conti nued the movement which His grace had given me.” 14
This, in her language, was the “first work of grace.”</p>
<p>On November i of that year another sermon — the “second work of
grace” — filled her with shame that she and her nuns were so lax in
observing their vows of poverty and seclusion. Torn between affection
for the nuns and desire to enforce the Cistercian rule, she became
melancholy, practiced austerities beyond her strength, and fell into a
fever. She must have been lovable, for when the nuns asked the reason of
her sadness, and she re- vealed her wish that they should return to the
full rule of their order, they consented, pooled their private property,
and pledged themselves to perpetual poverty.</p>
<p>The next step, seclusion from the world, was more painful. Mere</p>
<p>Angelique forbade the nuns to leave the premises, or to receive
visitors — even their nearest relatives — without express permission,
and then only in the parlor. They complained that this would be a great
hardship. To give them a fortifying example, she resolved not to see her
parents on their next visit, except through a grate or lattice window in
the door between the parlor and the convent rooms. When her father and
mother came they were shocked to find that she would talk to them only
through this</p>
<p>guichet. The journte du guichet (September 25, 1609) became famous in
the literature about Port-Royal.</p>
<p>The anger of the excluded family subsided, and the piety of Mere</p>
<p>Angelique (now eighteen years old) so moved them that one Arnauld
after another entered Port-Royal. In 1618 Anne Eugenie, sister of the
abbess, took the vows. Soon other sisters joined them — Catherine,
Marie, Madeleine. In 1629 their mother, now a widow, knelt at the feet
of Mere Angelique, and begged to be admitted as a novice. In due time
she took the vows, and lived humbly and happily under her daughter, whom
she henceforth called Mother. When she died (1641) she thanked God that
she had given six daughters to the religious life. Five of her
granddaughters later entered Port-Royal. Her son Robert and three of her
grandsons became “solitaries” there; her most brilliant son, Antoine
Arnauld II, member of the Sorbonne, became the philosopher and
theologian of Port-Royal. We marvel at such fertility, and cannot but
respect such depth of devotion, loyalty, and faith.*</p>
<ul>
<li>Sainte- Beuve noted that “several of the young ladies who became the
outstanding nuns of Port-Royal had had smallpo x, which at an early age
had disfigured their faces,” and added slyly, “I do not wish to say that
we give to God only that which no longer has value in the world .”
16</li>
</ul>
<p>52</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Step by step Mere Angelique led her flock back to the full Cistercian
rule. The nuns, now thirty-six in number, observed all fasts with
canonical strictness, maintained long periods of silence, rose at two
o’clock in the morning to chant matins, and out of their communal
property dispensed charity to the local poor. From Port-Royal the
reforms spread; nuns trained there were sent to convents throughout
France to spur them back to their rule. A convent at Maubuisson was
especially lax: Henry IV had used it as a place of assignation with hi s
mistress Gabrielle d’Estrees; its abbess was surrounded by her own
illegitimate daughters; the nuns moved freely from their home to meet
and dance with the monks of a neighboring monastery. 16 In 1618 Mere
Angelique was requested by her superiors to replace the abbess at
Maubuisson; she stayed there for five years; when she returned to
Port-Royal thirty-two Maubuisson nuns followed her into the mother
convent of the reform.</p>
<p>In 1626 an epidemic of ague broke out at Port-Royal. Advised that the
damp climate there was dangerous, Angelique and her nuns moved to a
house in Paris, where, under the influence of Jansenism, they entered
upon their historic conflict with the Jesuits and the King. The deserted
and dilapidated buildings at Port-Royal-des-Champs — “of the Fields” —
were soon occupied by the Solitaries, men who, while not taking monastic
vows, wished to lead an almost monastic life. Here came several of the
Arnaulds — Antoine II, his brother Robert Arnauld d’Andilly, his nephews
Antoine Lemaistre and Simon Lemaitre de Sericourt, and his grandson
Isaac Louis de Sacy; some ecclesiastics joined them, like Pierre Nicole
and Antoine Singlin; even some nobles — the Due de Luynes and the Baron
de</p>
<p>Pontchateau. Together they drained swamps, dug ditches, repaired the
buildings, and tended the orchards and gardens. Together or individually
they practiced austerities, fasted, chanted, and prayed. They wore the
dress of peasants, and during the coldest winter they allowed no heat in
their rooms. They studied the Bible and the Fathers of the Church; they
wrote works of devotion and scholarship; one of these, U Art de penser (
The Art of Thinking), by Nicole and the younger Arnauld, remained a
popular manual of logic till the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1638 the Solitaries opened petites e coles, “little schools,” to
which they invited selected children of age nine or ten. These were
taught French, Latin, Greek, and the orthodox aspects of Descartes’
philosophy. They were required to shun dancing and the theater (both of
which the Jesuits approved) ; they were to pray frequently, but not to
the saints; and in the chapel where they heard Mass there were no
religious images. At Port- Royal-des-Champs and at Port-Royal-de-Paris
the challenge of Arnauld piety to the immorality of the court became
also the challenge of the stern</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Jansenist theology and ethic to the Jesuit mitigation of Christianity
to the nature of man.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE JANSENISTS AND THE JESUITS</li>
</ol>
<p>Cornelis Jansen was a Dutchman, born in the province of Utrecht of
Catholic parentage, but closely touched by the Augustinian theology of
his Calvinist neighbors. When he entered the Catholic University of
Louvain (1602) he found it in the heat of a violent controversy between
the Jesuit or Scholastic party and a faction that followed the
Augustinian views of Michael Baius on predestination and divine grace.
Jansen inclined to the Augustinians. In the interval between his
undergraduate studies and his professorial work, Jansen accepted the
invitation of his fellow student Jean Duvergier de Hauranne to live with
him at Bayonne. They studied St. Paul and St. Augustine, and agreed that
the best way of defending Catholicism against the Dutch Calvinists and
the French Huguenots was to follow the Augustinian emphasis on grace and
predestination, and to establish in the Catholic clergy and laity a
rigorous moral code that would shame current laxity in court and
convent, and the easygoing ethic of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>In 1616 Jansen, as head of a hostel of Dutch students at Louvain, at-
tacked the Jesuit theology of free will, and preached a mystical
puritanism akin to the Pietism that was taking form in Holland, England,
and Germany. He continued the war as professor of Scriptural exegesis at
Louvain, and as bishop of Ypres. At his death (1638) he left, not quite
finished, a sub- stantial treatise, Augustinus, which, soon after its
publication in 1640, became the doctrinal platform of Port-Royal, and
the center of contention in French Catholic theology for almost a
century.</p>
<p>Though the book ended with a curtsy of submission to the Roman</p>
<p>Church, the Calvinists of the Netherlands acclaimed it as the very
essence of Calvinism. 17 Like Augustine, Luther, and Calvin, Jansen
fully accepted predestinarianism: God, even before the creation of the
world, had chosen those men and women who should be saved, and had
determined who should be damned; the good works of men, though precious,
could never earn salvation without the aid of divine grace; and even
among the good minority only a few would be saved. The Catholic Church
had not</p>
<p>explicitly repudiated the predestinarianism of St. Paul and
St. Augustine, but she had let it sink into the background of her
teaching as hard to reconcile with that freedom of the will which seemed
logically indispensable to moral responsibility and the idea of sin. But
man’s will is not free, said Jansen; it lost its freedom by Adam’s sin;
man’s nature is now corrupt</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>beyond self- redemption; and only God’s grace, earned by Christ’s
death, can save him. The Jesuit defense of free will seemed to Jansen to
exag- gerate the role of good works in earning salvation, and to render
almost superfluous the redeeming death of Christ. Moreover, he urged, we
must not take logic too seriously; reason is a faculty far inferior to
trustful, unquestioning faith, just as ritual observances are an
inferior form of religion as compared with the direct communion of the
soul with God.</p>
<p>These ideas came to Port-Royal through Duvergier, who meanwhile had
become abbot of St.-Cyran. Fired with zeal to reform theology and
morals, and to replace external religion with internal devotion, M. de
Saint-Cyran, as he was now called, came up to Paris, and was soon</p>
<ol start="1636" type="1">
<li>accepted as spiritual director of the nuns at Port-Royal-de-Paris
and of the solitaires at Port-Royal-des-Champs; that double institution
now became the voice and exemplar of Jansenism in France. Richelieu
thought the reformer a troublesome fanatic, and jailed him in Vincennes
(1638). Saint-Cyran was released in 1642, but he died a year later of an
apoplectic stroke.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even from his prison he had continued to inspire innumerable
Arnaulds. Antoine II, “the Great Arnauld,” published in 1643 a treatise
De la</p>
<p>Frequente Communion , which carried on his father’s war against the
Jesuits. He did not name them, but he denounced the idea, which he felt
that some confessors had tolerated, that repeated sinning could be com-
pensated by frequent confession and Communion. The Jesuits felt that the
attack was meant for them, and they mounted up the score against the
Arnaulds. Anticipating trouble, Antoine left Paris for
Port-Royal-in-the- Fields. In 1648 the nuns, frightened by the Fronde,
also left the capital, and returned to their former home. The Solitaries
vacated the rooms there, and moved to a nearby farmhouse, Les
Granges.</p>
<p>Pope Urban VIII had already (1642) condemned the general doctrine of
Jansen’s Augustinus. In 1649 a professor in the Sorbonne asked the</p>

<p>These propositions were not taken verbatim from the Augustinus : they
were formulated by a Jesuit as a summary of the book’s teaching. As a
summary they were fair enough, 19 but the Jansenists contended that the
propositions, as such, were not to be found in Jansen — though Arnauld
slyly suggested that they could all be found in St. Augustine. Meanwhile
nobody seems to have read the book.</p>
<p>Antoine Arnauld was a fighter. He acknowledged the infallibility of
the pope in matters of faith and morals, but not in questions of fact;
and as a matter of fact he denied that Jansen had stated the
propositions condemned. In 1655 he again carried the war to the Jesuits
by publishing two Lettres a un due et pair ( Letters to a Duke and
Peer), attacking what he claimed to be Jesuit methods in the
confessional. The Sorbonne entertained a motion to expel him. He
prepared his defense, and read it to his friends at Port-Royal. It did
not impress them. One of them was a new adherent named Blaise Pascal.
Turning to him, Arna uld pleaded, “You, who are young, why can - not you
produce something?” 20 Pascal retired to his room, and wrote the first
of the Provincial Letters, a classic in the literature and philosophy of
France. We should listen to Pascal at some length, for he was not only
the greatest writer of French prose, but the most brilliant defender of
religion in all the Age of Reason.</p>

<p>1 . Himself</p>
<p>His father, Etienne Pascal, was president of the Court of Aides
at</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand in south-central France. His mother died three years
after his birth, leaving also an elder sister, Gilberte, and a younger
sister, Jacqueline. When Blaise was eight the family moved to Paris.
Etienne was a student of geometry and physics, sufficiently advanced to
gain him the friendship of Gassendi, Mersenne, and Descartes. Blaise
eavesdropped on some of their meetings, and became, in the first period
of his life, a devotee of science. At the age of eleven he composed a
short treatise on the sounds of vibrating bodies. The father thought
that the boy’s passion for geometry would injure his other studies, and
forbade his further pursuit of mathe- matics for a while. But one day
(story tells), Etienne found him writing on</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>the wall, with a piece of coal, the proof that the three angles of a
triangle equal two right angles; 21 thenceforth the boy was allowed to
study Euclid. Before he was sixteen he composed a treatise on conic
sections; most of it is lost, but one theorem was a lasting contribution
to that science, and still bears his name. Descartes, shown the
manuscript, refused to believe that the composition was not by the
father but by the son.</p>
<p>In that year, 1639, his pretty sister Jacqueline, then thirteen years
old, played a dramatic part in the life of the family. The father had
invested in municipal bonds; Richelieu reduced the rate of interest paid
on these bonds; Etienne criticized him; the Cardinal threatened to
arrest him; Etienne hid in Auvergne. But the Cardinal liked plays and
girls; Scudery’s V Amour tyrannique was performed before him by a group
of girls includ- ing Jacqueline; he was especially pleased by her
acting; she took the op- portunity to ask him to forgive her father; he
did, and appointed him intendant at Rouen, the capital of Normandy.
Thither the family moved in</p>
<ol start="1641" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It was there that Blaise, now nineteen, contrived the first of
several computing machines, some of which are still preserved in the
Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers at Paris. Their principle was a
succession of wheels, each divided into nine digits and zero, each
geared to turn one tenth of a revolution for each full revolution of the
wheel at its right, and each show- ing its uppermost figure in a slot at
the top. The machine could only add, and was not commercially
practicable, but it stands near the head of a development that now
astonishes the world. Pascal sent one of his computers to Christina of
Sweden, with a very eloquent letter of adulation. She invited him to her
court, but he felt himself too frail for that heroic climate.</p>
<p>The eager young scientist was intensely interested in the experiments
that Torricelli had published on the weight of the atmosphere. Inde-
pendently of Torricelli, but probably on a suggestion from Descartes, 22
Pascal conceived the idea that the mercury in a Torricelli tube would
rise to different heights in different places according to variations in
atmospheric pressure. He sent a request to his brother-in-law in
Auvergne to carry a tube of mercury to a mountaintop, and observe any
difference, at diverse levels, in the height of the mercury in the
closed portion of a tube whose other end was open to the pressure of the
atmosphere. Florin Perier did as asked: on September 19, 1648, with
several friends, he ascended the Puy de Dome, a mountain five thousand
feet above the town of Clermont- Ferrand; there the mercury rose to a
level of twenty-three inches in the tube, whereas at the base of the
mountain it rose to twenty-six inches. The experiment was hailed
throughout Europe as finally establishing the principle and value of the
barometer.</p>
<p>Pascal’s fame as a sci entist brought him (1648) a stimulating appeal
from</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>a gambler to formulate the mathematics of chance. He accepted the
chal- lenge, and shared with Fermat in developing the calculus of
probabilities, which now enters so profitably into insurance tables of
sickness and mortality. At this stage of his growth there was no sign
that he would ever transfer his devotion from science to religion, or
lose his faith in reason and experiment. He continued for ten years to
work at scientific problems, chiefly mathematical. As late as 1658 he
offered, anonymously, a prize for the quadrature of a cycloid — the
curve traced by a point on a circle rolling in a straight line on a
plane. Solutions were offered by Wallis, Huygens, Wren, and others; then
Pascal, under a pseudonym, published his own solu- tion. A controversy
followed in which the competitors, including Pascal, behaved less than
philosophically.</p>
<p>Meanwhile two basic influences had come to the fore in his life:
sickness and Jansenism. As early as his eighteenth year he suffered from
a nervous ailment that left him hardly a day without pain. In 1647 a
paralytic attack so disabled him that he could not move without
crutches. His head ached, his bowels burned, his legs and feet were
continually cold, and required wearisome aids to circulation of the
blood; he wore stockings steeped in brandy to warm his feet. Partly to
get better medical treatment he moved with Jacqueline to Paris. His
health improved, but his nervous system had been permanently damaged.
Henceforth he was subject to a deepening hypochondria, which affected
his character and his philosophy. He became irritable, subject to fits
of proud and imperious anger, and he seldom smiled. 23</p>
<p>His father had always been a devout, even an austere, Catholic amid
his scientific avocations, and had taught his children that religious
faith was their most precious possession, something far beyond the reach
or judgment of the frail reasoning powers of mankind. At Rouen, when the
father was seriously injured, a Jansenist physician treated him
successfully; through this contact a Jansenist tinge colored the
family’s faith. When Blaise and Jacqueline moved to the capital they
frequently attended Mass at Port- Royal-de-Paris. Jacqueline wished to
enter the convent as a nun, but her father could not bring himself to
let her go out of his daily life. He died in 1651, and soon thereafter
Jacqueline became a nun in Port-Royal-des- Champs. Her brother tried in
vain to dissuade her.</p>
<p>For a time they engaged in a dispute over the division of their
patrimony. When this was settled Blaise found himself both rich and free
— a condition hostile to sanctity. He took a sumptuously furnished home,
staffed it with many servants, and drove about Paris in a coach behind
four or six horses. 24 His temporary recovery gave him a deceptive
euphoria, which turned him from piety to pleasure. We must not grudge
him his few years “in the</p>
<p>5 «</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<p>games and belles, and for an exciting while pursued in Auvergne a
lady of beauty and learning, the “Sappho of the countryside.” 25 About
this time he wrote a Discours sur les passions de P amour, and
apparently he contemplated marriage — which he was later to describe as
“the lowest of the conditions of life permitted to a Ch ristian.” 20
Among his friends were some libertins , who combined free morals with
free thought. Perhaps through them Pascal became interested in
Montaigne, whose Essais now entered deeply into his life. Their first
influence probably inclined him to religious doubt.</p>
<p>Jacqueline, hearing of his new frivolity, reproached him, and prayed
for his reform. It was characteristic of his emotional nature that an
accident reinforced her prayers. One day, as he was driving over the
Pont de Neuilly, the four horses took fright, and plunged over the
parapet into the Seine. The carriage almost followed them; fortunately
the reins broke, and the coach hung half over the edge. Pascal and his
friends emerged, but the sensitive philosopher, terrified by the
nearness of death, fainted away, and remained unconscious for some time.
On recovering he felt that he had had a vision of God. In an ecstasy of
fear, remorse, and gratitude he re- corded his vision on a parchment
which henceforth he carried sewn in the lining of his coat:</p>
<p>The year of grace 1654.</p>
<p>Monday, Nov. 23rd, . . . from about half past six in the</p>
<p>evening to half an hour after midnight.</p>

<p>He resumed his visits to Port-Royal and Jacqueline, gladdening
her</p>
<p>heart with his new mood of humility and penitence. He listened to the
sermons of Antoine Singlin. In December, 1654, he became a member of</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>the Port-Royal community. 28 In January he had a long conversation
there with Sacy, who undertook to convince him of the superficiality of
science and the futility of philosophy. Amauld and Nicole discovered in
the new recruit an ardor of conversion, and a skill in literary
expression, that seemed a providential instrument placed in their hands
to defend Port- Royal against its enemies. They begged him to devote his
pen to answering the Jesuits who were trying to make Jansenism a sin. He
responded with such brilliance and force that to this day the Society of
Jesus feels his sting.</p>
<p>2 . The Provincial Letters</p>
<p>On January 23 and 29, 1656, Pascal published the first and second of
what he called Lettres ecrites par Louis de Montalte d un provincial de
ses amis , et aux RR. PP. Jesuites, sur la morale et la politique de ces
Peres — “Letters written by Louis de Montalte” (a fictitious name) “to a
provincial friend, and to the rever end Jesuit Fathers, on their ethics
and politics.” The framework was clever: it pretended to be the report
of a Parisian to a friend in the provinces on the moral and theological
issues then excit- ing the intellectual and religious circles in the
capital. Amauld and Nicole helped Pascal with facts and references;
Pascal, combining the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a
man of the world, provided the style that reached a new level in French
prose.</p>
<p>The first letters sought public support for those Jansenist views on
grace and salvation which Arnauld had defended; they were designed to
in- fluence the Sorbonne against the motion to expel Arnauld. In this
they failed; Arnauld was solemnly degraded and expelled (January 31).
The failure stimulated Pascal and Arnauld to attack the Jesuits as
undermining morality by the laxity of their confessors and the loopholes
of their casu- istry. They explored the tomes of Escobar and other
Jesuits, and denounced the doctrines of “probabilism,” “direction of
intention,” and “mental reser - vation”; even the Jesuit missionaries’
accommodation of Christian theology to Chinese ancestor worship was
condemned 29 — though they made no explicit charge that the Jesuits
justified means by ends. As the letters proceeded, and Arnauld revealed
more and more of Escobar’s casuistry to Pascal, the convert’s passion
rose. After the tenth letter he abandoned the fiction of a Parisian
writing to a provincial; he spoke now in his own person, and addressed
the Jesuits directly with indignant eloquence and sarcastic wit.
Sometimes he gave twenty days to composing one letter, then rushed it
off to the printer lest the public interest should cool. He gave a
unique apology for the length of Letter XVI: “I had no time - to make it
shorter.” 30 In the eighteenth and final letter (March 24, 1657) he</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>defied the Pope himself. Alexander VII had issued (October 16, 1656)
another denunciation of Jansenism; Pascal reminded his readers that the
papal judgment might err, as (he felt) it had done in the case of
Galileo. 31 The Pope condemned the letters (September 6, 1657), but all
educated France read them.</p>
<p>Were they fair to the Jesuits? Were the excerpts from Jesuit writers
correctly quoted? “It is quite true,” says a learned rationalist, “that
qualify - ing phrases have at times been improperly omitted, a few
phrases have been wrongly translated, and the condensing of long
passages into short sentences has in a few instances the effect of an
injustice”; but, he adds, “these cases are relatively few and
unimportant”; 32 and the essential ac - curacy of the extracts is now
generally acknowledged. 33 It must be ad- mitted, however, that Pascal
took out of their context the most alarming and questionable passages of
some casuists, and led a part of the public to the exaggerated view that
these theological jurists were conspiring to destroy the morality of
Christendom. Voltaire praised the excellence of the Letters as
literature, but thought that “the whole book rested on a false basis.
The author skillfully ascribed to the whole of the Society the
extravagant ideas of a few Spanish and Flemish Jesuits,” 34 from whom
many other Jesuits had di ffered. D’Alembert regretted that Pascal had
not lampooned the Jansenists too, for “the shocking doctrine of Jansen
and Saint-Cyran afforded at least as much room for ridicule as the
pliant doctrine of Molina, Tambourin, and Vasquez.” 35</p>
<p>The influence of the Letters was immense. They did not immediately
lessen the power of the Jesuits — certainly not with the King — but they
so shamed the excesses of the casuists that Alexander VII himself, while
continuing his opposition to Jansenism, condemned “laxism,” and ordered
a revision of casuistical texts (1665-66). 36 It was the Letters that
gave the word “casuistry” its connotation of specious subtleties
defending wrong actions or ideas. Meanwhile a masterpiece of style had
been added to French literature. It was as if Voltaire had lived a
century before Voltaire — for here were the gay wit, the cutting irony,
the skeptical humor, the passionate invective of Voltaire, and, in the
later letters, that warm re- sentment of injustice which redeemed
Voltaire from being an encyclopedia of persiflage. Voltaire himself
called the Letters “the best - written book that has yet appeared in
France”; 37 and the most penetrating and discrimi - nating of all
critics held that Pascal “invented fine prose in France.” 38 Bossuet,
being asked what book he would rather have written had he not written
his own, answered, the Provincial Letters of Pascal. 39</p>

<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>6 1</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In Defense of Faith</li>
</ol>
<p>Pascal returned to Paris in 1656 to superintend the publication of
the Letters, and lived there through his six remaining years. He had not
aban- doned the world; in the very year of his death he shared in
organizing a regular coach service in the capital — the germ of the
present omnibus net- work. But two events occurred which renewed his
piety, and led to his culminating contribution to literature and
religion. On March 15, 1657, the Jesuits secured from the Queen Mother
an order closing the schools of the Solitaries and forbidding the
admission of new members to Port-Royal. The order was peacefully obeyed;
the children, now including Racine, were sent to the houses of friends,
and the teachers sadly dispersed. Nine days later (the date of the last
of the Provincial Letters) an apparent miracle occurred in the chapel of
the troubled nunnery. Pascal’s ten -year- old niece, Marguerite Perier,
suffered from a painful lachrymal fistula that exuded noisome pus
through eyes and nose. A relative of Mere Angelique had presented to
Port-Royal what he and others claimed to be a thorn from the crown that
had tortured Christ. On March 24 the nuns, in solemn ceremony and
singing psalms, placed the thorn on their altar. Each in turn kissed the
relic, and one of them, seeing Marguerite among the worshipers, took the
thorn and with it touched the girl’s sore. That evening, we are told,
Marguerite expressed surprise that her eye no longer pained her; her
mother was astonished to find no sign of the fistula; a physician,
summoned, reported that the discharge and the swelling had disappeared.
He, not the nuns, spread word of what he termed a miracu- lous cure.
Seven other physicians who had had previous knowledge of Marguerite’s
fistula subscribed a statement that in their judgment a miracle had
taken place. The diocesan officials investigated, came to the same
conclusion, and authorized a Te Deum Mass in Port-Royal. Crowds of
believers came to see and kiss the thorn; all Catholic Paris acclaimed a
miracle; the Queen Mother ordered all persecution of the nuns to stop;
the Solitaries returned to Les Granges. (In 1728 Pope Benedict XIII re-
ferred to the case as proving that the age of miracles had not passed.)
Pascal made himself an armorial emblem of an eye surrounded by a crown
of thorns, with the inscription Scio cui credidi — “I know whom I have
believed.” 40</p>
<p>He now set himself to write, as his last testament, an elaborate
defense of religious belief. All that he found strength to do was to jot
down isolated thoughts and group them into a tentative but telling
order. Then (1658) his old ailments returned, and with such crippling
severity that he was never able to give these notes coherent sequence or
structural form. After</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>his death his devoted friend the Due de Roannez and the scholars of
Port- Royal edited and published the material as Pensees de M. Pascal
sur la religion , et sur quelques autres sujets (1670). They feared that
as Pascal had left these fragmentary “thoughts” they might lead to
skepticism rather than to piety; they concealed the skeptical pieces,
and modified some of the rest lest King or Church should take olfense;
41 for at that time the persecution of Port-Royal had ceased, and the
editors deprecated a re- newal of controversy. Not till the nineteenth
century were the Pensees of Pascal published in their full and authentic
text.</p>
<p>If we may venture to impose an order upon them, we may place their
starting point in the Copernican astronomy. We feel again, as we listen
to Pascal, the tremendous blow that the Copemican-Galilean astronomy was
dealing to the traditional form of Christianity.</p>
<p>Let man contemplate Nature entire in her full and lofty majesty;</p>
<p>let him put far from his sight the lowly objects that surround
him;</p>
<p>let him regard that blazing light, placed like an eternal lamp to</p>
<p>illuminate the world; let the earth appear to him but a point
within</p>
<p>the vast circuit which that star describes; and let him marvel that
this immense circumference is itself but a speck from the viewpoint of
the stars that move in the firmament. And if our vision is stopped
there, let imagination pass beyond. . . . All this visible world is but
an im-</p>
<p>perceptible element in the great bosom of nature. No thought can go
so far. … It is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere, and</p>
<p>whose circumference is nowhere . 42 This is the most perceivable</p>
<p>feature of the almightiness of God, so that our imagination loses
itself in this thought.</p>
<p>And Pascal adds, in a famous line characteristic of his philosophical
sensi - tivity, “The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens
me.” 43</p>
<p>But there is another infinity — the infinitely small, the endless
theoretical divisibility of the “uncuttable” atom: no matter how tiny
the minim to which we reduce anything, we cannot but believe that it too
has parts smaller than itself. Our reason wavers perplexed and appalled
between the infinitely vast and the infinitely minute.</p>
<p>He who sees himself thus will be frightened by himself, and, per-</p>
<p>ceiving himself sustained . . . between these two abysses of infinity
and nothing, will tremble . . . and will be more disposed to
contemplate</p>
<p>these marvels in silence than to explore them with presumption. For
in the end, what is man in nature? A nothing in respect to the infinite,
everything in respect to the nothing, a halfway between nothing and all.
Infinitely far from comprehending the extremes, both the end and the
beginning or principle of things are invincibly hidden in an im-</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>penetrable secret; he is equally incapable of seeing the nothing
whence he has been drawn, and the infinite in which he is engulfed. 44
*</p>
<p>Science, therefore, is a silly presumption. It is based on reason,
which is based on the senses, which deceive us in a hundred ways. It is
limited by the narrow bounds within which our senses operate, and by the
cor- ruptible brevity of the flesh. Left to itself, reason cannot
understand — or offer a solid base to — morality, the family, or the
state, much less perceive the real nature and order of the world, not to
speak of comprehending God. There is more wisdom in custom, even in
imagination and myth, than in reason, and “the wisest reason takes as
her own principles those which the imagination of man has ev erywhere
rashly introduced .” 46 There are two kinds of wisdom: that of the
simple and “ignorant” multitude, who live by the wisdom of tradition and
imagination (ritual and myth); and that of the sage who has pierced
through science and philosophy to realize his ignorance . 47 Therefore
“there is nothing so conformable to reason as to disavow reason,” and
“to make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher .” 48</p>
<p>So Pascal thought it unwise to rest religion on reason, as even some
Jansenists tried to do. Reason cannot prove God, nor immortality; in
either case the evidence is too contradictory. Nor can the Bible serve
as the final basis of faith, for it is full of passages ambiguous or
obscure, and the prophecies which piety interprets as pointing to Christ
may have had quite other significance . 49 Moreover, God in the Bible
speaks through figures, whose literal sense is misleading, and whose
real meaning is per- ceived only by those blessed with divine grace. “We
understand nothing of the works of God unless we take it as a principle
that He wishes to blind some and to enlighten others .” 50 (Here Pascal
seems to take literally the story of Yahveh hardening Pharaoh’s
heart.)</p>
<p>Everywhere, if we rely on reason, we find the unintelligible. Who can
understand, in man, the union and interaction of an obviously material
body and an obviously immaterial mind? “There is nothing so inconceiva -
ble as that matter should be conscious of itself .” 51 Philosophers who
have mastered their passions — “what matter could do that ?” 52 And the
nature of man, so mingled of angel and brute , 53 repeats the
contradiction of mind and body, and reminds us of the Chimera, which, in
Greek mythology, was a she- goat with a lion’s head and a serpent’s
tail.</p>

about it later. . . . We lose our lives with joy provided people talk
about it. . . . Even philoso- phe rs wish for admirers .” 58 Yet it is
part of man’s greatness that out of his wickedness, his hatred, and his
vanity he evolved a code of law and morals to control his wickedness,
and drew out of his lust an ideal of love . 59</p>
<p>The misery of man is another mystery. Why should the universe have
labored so long to produce a species so fragile in its happiness, so
subject to pain in every nerve, to grief in every love, to death in
every life? And yet “the grandeur of man is great in that he knows
himself to be</p>
<p>miserable .” 60</p>
<p>Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a</p>
<p>thinking reed.* The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him;
a vapor, a drop of water, suffice to kill him. But when the universe</p>
<p>has crushed him man will still be nobler than that which kills
him,</p>
<p>because he knows that he is dying, and of its victory the
universe</p>
<p>knows nothing . 61</p>
<p>None of these mysteries finds an answer in reason. If we trust to
reason alone we shall condemn ourselves to a Pyrrhonism that will doubt
every- thing except pain and death, and philosophy could be at best a
rationaliza- tion of defeat. But we cannot believe that man’s fate is as
reason sees it — to struggle, to suffer, and to die, having begotten
others to struggle, to suffer, and to die, generation after generation,
aimlessly, stupidly, in a ridiculous and superabundant insignificance.
In our hearts we feel that this cannot be true, that it would be the
greatest of all blasphemies to think that life and the universe have no
meaning. God and the meaning of life must be felt by the heart, rather
than by reason. “The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know
,” 62 and we do right to listen to our hearts, to “place our faith in
feeling .” 63 For all belief, even in practical matters, is a form of
will, a direction of attention and desire.” (The “will to be - lieve.”)
The mystical experience is profounder than the evidence of the</p>
<p>What answer, then, does feeling give to the mysteries of life and
thought?</p>

<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>6 5</p>
<p>The answer is religion. Only religion can restore meaning to life,
and nobility to man; without it we flounder ever more deeply into mental
frustration and mortal futility. Religion gives us a Bible; the Bible
tells us of man’s fall from grace; only that original sin can explain t
he strange union, in human nature, of hate and love, of bestial
wickedness and our longing for redemption and God. If we let ourselves
believe (however absurd it may seem to the philosophers) that man began
with divine grace, that he forfeited this by sin, and that he can be
redeemed only by divine grace through the crucified Christ, then we
shall find a peace of mind never granted to philosophers. He who cannot
believe is cursed, for he reveals by his unbelief that God has not
chosen to give him grace.</p>
<p>Belief is a wise wager. Granted that faith cannot be proved, what
harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false?
“You must wager; it is not optional . . . Let us weigh the gain and the
loss in wagering that God exists … If you gain, you gain all; if you
lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists
.” 64 If at first you find it difficult to believe, follow the customs
and rituals of the Church as if you did believe. “Bless yourself with
holy water, have Masses said, and so on; by a simple and natural process
this will make you believe, and will dull you” ( cela vous fera croire,
et vous abetira ) — will quiet your proudly critical intellect . 65 Go
to confession and communion; you will find it a relief and a
strengthening . 66</p>
<p>We do injustice to this historic apologia by letting it end on so
unheroic a note. We may be sure that Pascal, when he believed, did so
not as a gambler but as a soul baffled and buffeted by life, humbly
recognizing that his intellect, whose brilliance had astonished friends
and foes, was no match for the universe, and finding in faith the only
way to give meaning and pardon to his pain. “Pascal is sick,” said
Sainte - Beuve; “we must al - ways remember this in reading him .” 67
But Pascal would have replied: Are we not all sick? Let him who is
perfectly happy reject faith. Let him reject it who is content with no
more meaning in life than a helpless trajectory from a filthy birth to
an agonizing death.</p>
<p>Picture a number of men in chains, and all condemned to death;</p>
<p>each day some are strangled in the sight of the rest; those who
remain see their own condition in that of these their fellows, looking
at one another with sorrow and without hope, each awaiting his turn.
This is the picture of the condition of man . 68</p>
<p>How shall we redeem this obscene slaughter called history except by
be- lieving, with or against the evidence, that God will right all
wrongs in the</p>
<p>Pascal argued so earnestly because he had never really recovered
from</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>T H £ AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>the doubts suggested to him by Montaigne, by the libertins of his
“years in the world,” and by the merciless neutrality of nature between
“evil” and “good.”</p>
<p>This is what I see, and what troubles me. I look on all sides,
and</p>
<p>everywhere I see nothing but obscurity. Nature offers me nothing</p>
<p>that is not a matter of doubt and disquiet. If I saw no signs of
a</p>
<p>divinity, I would fix myself in denial. If I saw everywhere the
marks</p>
<p>of a Creator, I would repose peacefully in faith. But seeing too much
to deny 〔Him〕, and too little to assure me, I am in a pitiful state,
and I would wish a hundred times that if a God sustains nature it
would</p>
<p>reveal Him without ambiguity. 68</p>
<p>It is this profound uncertainty, the paralyzing ability to see both
sides, that makes Pascal a fascination to believer and doubter alike.
This man had felt the atheist’s angry resentment of evil, and the
believer’s trust in the triumph of the good; he had passed through the
intellectual gyrations of Montaigne and Charron to the happy humility of
St. Francis of Assisi and St. Thomas a Kempis. It is this cry from the
depths of doubt, this desperate forging of a faith against death, that
make the Fensees the most eloquent book in French prose. Again, for the
third time in the seventeenth century, philosophy became literature, not
with the cool pithiness of Bacon, nor with the ingratiating intimacy of
Descartes, but with the</p>
<p>emotional power of a poet feeling philosophy, writing to his own
heart in his own blood. In the apex of the classic age rose this
romantic appeal, strong enough to survive Boileau and Voltaire, and to
be heard across a century by Rousseau and Chateaubriand. Here, in the
morning of the Age of Reason, in the very decades of Hqbbes and Spinoza,
reason found a challenger in a dying man.</p>
<p>In his final y ears, said his sister Mme. Perier, Pascal suffered
“continual and ever- increasing maladies.” 70 He came to think that
“sickness is the natural state of Christians.” 71 Sometimes he welcomed
his pains as dis - tracting him from temptations. “One hour’s pain,” he
said, “is a better teacher than all the philosophers put together.” 72
He renounced every pleasure, took to ascetic practices, flogged himself
with a girdle studded with iron spikes. 73 He rebuked Mme. Perier for
allowing her children to caress her. He opposed the marriage of her
daughter, saying that “the marriage state is no better than paganism in
the eyes of God.” 74 He would not allow anyone, in his presence, to
speak of the beauty of woman.</p>
<p>In 1662, as one of many charitable acts, he took a poor family into
his home. When one of the children developed smallpox Pascal, instead of
asking the family to leave, moved to the house of his sister. Soon

<p>ward he took to his bed, racked with colic pains. He drew up his
will, leaving nearly half his fortune to the poor. He confessed to a
priest, and received viaticum. He died after a violent convulsion,
August 19, 1662, in the fortieth year of his age. Upon opening his body
it was found that his stomach and liver were diseased, and his
intestines gangrened. 75 His brain, reported the doctors, “was of
prodigious abundance, its substance solid and condensed,” but only one
of the cranial sutures had properly closed; hence, perhaps, his terrible
headaches. On the cortex were two depressions, “as large as if made by
fingers laid in wax.” 76 He was buried in the church of his parish,
St.-£tienne-du-Mont.</p>
<p>V. PORT-ROYAL; 1656-1715</p>
<p>The Provincial Letters intensified the resolution of the Jesuits and
the bishops to suppress Jansenism as Protestantism in disguise. At the
urging of French bishops, Pope Alexander VII issued (October 6, 1656) a
bull requiring all French ecclesiastics to subscribe to the following
formulary:</p>
<p>I submit myself sincerely to the constitution of Pope Innocent X,</p>
<p>dated May 31, 1653, according to its true sense, which has been de-
termined by the constitution of our Holy Father, Pope Alexander</p>
<p>VII, dated October 6, 1656. And I acknowledge that I am bound in</p>
<p>conscience to obey these constitutions; and I condemn with heart</p>
<p>and mouth the doctrine of the Five Propositions of Cornelis
Jansen,</p>
<p>contained in his book entitled Augustinus.</p>
<p>Mazarin refrained from enforcing signatures to this formulary, but on
April 13, 1661, soon after Mazarin’s death, Louis XIV promulgated the
order. A friendly diocesan vicar prefaced the formulary with a
conciliatory statement. In this form Arnauld and the Solitaries signed
it, and advised the nuns of Port-Royal to do likewise. Mere Angelique,
bedridden with dropsy, refused, and persisted till her death on August
6, 1661, aged seventy. Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, now
subprioress, also refused. “Since the bishops have the courage only of
girls,” said Jacqueline, “girls must have the cour - age of bishops.” 77
Finally all the surviving nuns signed; but Jacqueline, exhausted by her
long resistance, died on October 4, aged thirty-six; and Pascal followed
her within a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the King repudiated the conciliatory preamble, and insisted
that the nuns should sign the formulary without any addition or change.
Those few who did this were transferred to Port-Royal in Paris. The
great majority of the nuns, led by Mere Agnes, announced that they could
not in conscience sign a document so contrary to their beliefs. In
August,</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>1 665, the archbishop disqualified the seventy nuns and their
fourteen lay sisters from receiving the sacraments, and forbade them to
have any com- munication with the outside world. During the next three
years a sympa- thetic priest scaled the walls of Port-Royal-des-Champs
to give viaticum to dying nuns. In 1666 Sacy, Lemaitre, and three other
Solitaries were arrested by order of the King. Arnauld, disguised with
wig and sword, was sheltered by the Duchesse de Longueville, who waited
upon him in person during his concealment. 78 She and other titled
ladies took up the cause of the nuns; they prevailed upon Louis to
relent; and in 1668 Pope Clement IX issued a new bull, so wisely
ambiguous as to allow all parties to accept it. The prisoners were
released, the dispersed nuns were restored to Port-Royal-des-Champs;
once again the bells tolled there, which had been silent for three
years. Arnauld was received amicably by the King, and wrote a book
against the Calvinists. Nicole, however, wrote another book against the
Jesuits.</p>
<p>This “Peace of the Church” lasted eleven years. Then Mme. de Longue-
ville died, and the peace died with her. As the King aged, and his vic-
tories turned into defeats, his religion became a mess of bigotry and
fear. Was God punishing him for tolerating heresy? His dislike of
Jansenism took on a personal tinge. When a M. Fontpertuis was
recommended for office Louis rejected him as suspected of Jansenism, but
when he was assured that the man was merely an atheist he confirmed the
nomination. 79 He could never forgive the nuns for defying his order to
sign the undiluted formulary. To ensure the early disappearance of this
center of disaffection, he forbade it to accept new members. He appealed
to Clement XI to issue an unmistakable condemnation of Jansenism; after
two years of prodding, the Pope fulminated the bull Vineam Domini
(1705). By that time only twenty-five nuns survived at Port-Royal, the
youngest sixty years old. The King impatiently awaited their death.</p>
<p>In 1709 the Jesuit Michel Tellier, aged sixty-six, succeeded Pere
La</p>
<p>Chaise as the royal confessor. He urged upon Louis, now seventy-one,
that the eternal fate of his soul depended upon the immediate and
outright extermination of Port-Royal. Many of the secular clergy,
including Louis Antoine de Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, protested
against such haste, but the King overruled them. On August 29, 1709, the
abbey was surrounded by troops; the nuns were shown a lettre de cachet
ordering their dispersal without delay; they were given fifteen minutes
to gather up their be- longings. Their cries and tears availed nothing.
They were loaded into coaches, and were scattered among various
conformist convents sixty to 150 miles away. In 1710 the buildings of
the famous nunnery were razed to the ground.</p>
<p>Jansenism survived. Arnauld and Nicole died in Flanders exile
(1694-95),</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>but in 1687 Pasquier Quesnel, a priest of the Paris Oratory, defended
the Jansenist theology in Reflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament.
Im- prisoned (1703), he escaped to Amsterdam, where he established a
Jansenist church. As his book won much support among the French secular
clergy, Louis induced Clement XI to issue the bull Unigenitus (September
8,</p>
<p>1713), which condemned 104 propositions ascribed to Quesnel. Many
French prelates resented the bull as a papal interference with the
Gallican Church, and Jansenism merged with a revival of the Gallican
movement. When Louis XIV died, there were more Jansenists in France than
ever before. 80</p>
<p>Today we find it hard to understand why a nation should have been
divided, and a king so excited, about abstruse problems of divine grace,
predestination, and free will; we forget that religion was then as
important as politics seem now. Jansenism was the final effort of the
Reformation in France, and the last flare of the Middle Ages. In the
perspective of his- tory it appears as a reaction rather than an
advance. But in several aspects its influence was progressive. For a
while it fought for a measure of re- ligious freedom — though we shall
find it in Voltaire’s days more intolerant than the papacy. 81 It
checked the excesses of casuistry. Its moral fervor was a wholesome
counterweight to a policy of confessional lenience that may have shared
in the deterioration of French morality. Its educational influence was
good; the petites ecoles were the best of their time. Its literary
influence emerged not only in Pascal but moderately in Corneille,
vividly in Racine, pupil and historian of Port-Royal. Its philosophical
influence was indirect and unintentional: its concept of God as damning
to ever- lasting torture the larger part of the human race — including
all unbaptized children, all Mohammedans, and all Jews — may have had
some part in leading the Voltaires and the Diderots into rebellion
against the entire Christian theology.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>THE KING AND THE HUGUENOTS: 1643-1715</li>
</ol>
<p>The King had not yet saved his soul, for there were 1,500,000
Prot-</p>
<p>estants in France. Mazarin had continued and developed Richelieu’s
policy of protecting the religious freedom of the Huguenots so long as
they remained politically obedient. Colbert recognized how valuable they
were in the commerce and industry of France. In 1652 Louis confirmed the
Edict of Nantes (1598) of his grandfather Henry IV; and in 1666 he</p>
<p>expressed his appreciation of Huguenot loyalty during the Fronde. But
it grieved him that the unity of France could not be religious as well
as political; and about 1670 he wrote an ominous passage in his
memoirs:</p>
<p>7 o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>As to that great number of my subjects of the so-called Reformed</p>
<p>religion, an evil . . . that I regard with sorrow . . . , it seems to
me that those who wished to employ violent remedies did not know the
nature of this evil, caused in part by the warmth of minds, which must
be</p>
<p>left to pass away and to die out insensibly, instead of exciting it
anew by such strong contradictions. … I believed that the best means,
in</p>
<p>order to reduce the Huguenots of my kingdom by degrees, was, in</p>
<p>the first place, not to constrain them at all by any new rigor, to
cause that to be observed toward them that they had obtained from my</p>
<p>predecessors, but to accord them nothing beyond this, and even to</p>
<p>confine its execution within the narrowest limits which justice
and</p>
<p>propriety could permit. 82</p>
<p>This has an air of sincere intolerance. It is the view of an absolute
king who has taken from Bossuet the motto Un roi, une loi, une foi —
“One king, one law, one faith.” It is no longer the tolerance of
Richelieu, who appointed to office able men of any creed; Louis goes on
to say that he would appoint only good Catholics to office, and trust
thereby to encour- age conversions.</p>
<p>The Church herself had never approved the toleration guaranteed by
the Edict of Nantes. An assembly of the clergy in 1655 called for a
stricter interpretation of the edict; their assembly of 1660 asked the
King to close all Huguenot colleges and hospitals, and to exclude
Huguenots from public office; their assembly of 1670 recommended that
children who had reached their seventh birthday should be deemed legally
capable of abjuring the Huguenot heresy, and that those who so abjured
should be removed from their parents; in 1675 their assembly demanded
that mixed marriages be declared null, and that the offspring of such
marriages be classed as illegiti- mate. 83 Pious and kindly priests like
Cardinal de Berulle contended that forcible repression by the state was
the only practical way of dealing with Protestantism. 84 One prelate
after another urged upon the King the argu- ment that the stability of
his government rested on social order, which rested on morality, which
would collapse without the support of the state religion. Catholic
laymen joined in the argument. Magistrates reported troublesome
conflicts between the rival creeds in the towns — Catholic attacks upon
Protestant churches, funerals, and homes, and Protestant re- prisals in
kind.</p>
<p>Louis, against his better nature, yielded bit by bit to this
campaign.</p>
<p>Perpetually in need of money for war and elegance, he found the
clergy offering him substantial grants on condition of accepting their
views. Other factors drove him in the same direction. He was encouraging
— bribing — Charles II to turn England toward Catholicism; how could he
meanwhile allow Protestantism in France? Had not the Protestants, in the
Peace of</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH 71</p>
<p>Augsburg (1555) and later, agreed to the principle Cuius regio
eius</p>
<p>religio — that the religion of the ruler should be made obligatory
upon his subjects? Were not Protestant rulers in Germany and the United
Provinces banishing families that rejected the religion of the
prince?</p>
<p>From the beginning of his active reign Louis — or his ministers with
his consent — issued a succession of decrees that moved toward full
revocation of the toleration edict. In 1 66 1 he outlawed Protestant
worship in most of the province of Gex, near the Swiss border, on the
ground that Gex had been added to France since the edict; however, there
were seventeen thousand Protestants in that province, and only four
hundred Catholics. 85 In 1664 advancement to mastership in the guilds
was made especially difficult for any but Catholics. 86 In 1665 boys of
fourteen and girls of twelve were authorized to accept conversion to
Catholicism and to leave their parents, who were thereafter required to
pay them an annuity for their support. 87 In 1666 the Huguenots were
forbidden to establish new colleges, or to maintain academies for the
education of the young nobility. In 1669 the emigration of Huguenots was
made punishable with arrest if they were captured, and confiscation of
goods; 88 and anyone who aided a Huguenot to emigrate was subject to
condemnation to the galleys for life. 89 In 1677 Louis permitted the
endowment of a “treasury of conver - s ions,” from which sums averaging
six livres per head were given to</p>
<p>Huguenots accepting conversion to the Catholic faith. To ensure
durability of conversions Louis decreed (1679) the banishment of all
relapsed con- verts, and the confiscation of their property. 90 A
protest from the Elector of Brandenburg, complaints from Colbert that
these measures were de- pressing trade, and the King’s absorption in
campaigns interrupted the stream of prohibitions. But his reconciliation
with monogamous Catholicism in 1681 turned him again to the holy war
against the Huguenots. Now he told an aide that he felt himself
“indispensably bound to effect the conversion of all his subjects and
the extirpation of heresy.” 91 In 1682 he</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dragonnades had begun. It was an old custom in France
to lodge troops in and at the expense of communes or homes. Louvois,
minister of war, proposed to the King (April 11, 1681) that converts to
Catholicism be exempt for two years from such billeting of troops. It
was so ordered. Louvois now directed the military administrators of
the</p>
<p>provinces of Poitou and Limousin to house their dragoons (mounted</p>
<p>7 *</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>soldiers) among Huguenots, especially among the well-to-do. In Poitou
Marechal de Marillac let his troops understand that he would not resent
sorrie apostolic zeal in their treatment of their heretic hosts. Soon
the soldiers were robbing, beating, raping the Huguenots. When Louis
heard of these excesses he reproved Marillac, and when they continued he
dis- missed him. 93 On May 19 he ordered the suspension of conversion by
billeting, and condemned the acts of violence committed in some places
against the Reformers. 94 Louvois notified provincial administrators
that they might continue the dragonnades, but warned them to keep all
knowl- edge of this from the King. The dragonnades spread through a
large part of France, and brought in thousands of converts; some towns
and provinces — Montpellier, Nimes, Bearn — abjured wholesale their
Calvinistic faith. The majority of the Huguenots, terrified, pretended
conversion; but thou- sands, defying the laws, abandoned their homes and
property and fled across frontiers or overseas. Louis was told that very
few Huguenots were left in France, and that the Edict of Nantes had
become meaningless. In 1684 the general assembly of the clergy
petitioned the King that the edict be completely annulled, and that “the
undisturbed reign of Jesus Christ . . . be re- established in France.”
95</p>
<p>On October 17, 1685, the King revoked the Edict of Nantes as now</p>
<p>unnecessary in a France almost entirely Catholic. All Huguenot
worship and schooling were henceforth forbidden. All Huguenot
conventicles were to be destroyed or transformed into Catholic churches.
Huguenot clergy- men were ordered to leave France within fourteen days,
but emigration of other Huguenots was prohibited on pain of condemnation
to the galleys for life. Half the goods of lay emigrants was pledged to
informers. 96 All children born in France were to be baptized by
priests, and were to be brought up in the Catholic faith. A final clause
promised that the few remaining Huguenots would be allowed to dwell
peacefully in certain towns. This article was carried out in Paris and
its suburbs; Huguenot tradesmen there were protected and reassured by
the lieutenant of police; there were no dragonnades in or near Paris;
the dancing could go on at Versailles, and the King could sleep with a
good conscience. But in many provinces, under Louvois’ urging, 97 the
dragonnades continued, and obdu - rate Huguenots were subjected to
pillage and torture. Says the leading French authority on the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes:</p>
<p>All was permitted to the soldiers except murder. They made the</p>
<p>Huguenots dance till exhausted; they tossed them up in blankets;</p>
<p>they poured boiling water down their throats . . . ; they beat
the</p>
<p>soles of their feet; they pulled out the hair of beards . . . ; they
burned the arms and legs of their hosts with candle flame . . . ; they
forced</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>them to hold burning charcoal in their hands . . . They burned
the</p>
<p>feet of many, holding them long before a great fire . . . They
forced</p>
<p>women to stand naked in the street, to bear the mockery and outrages
of passersby. They bound a nursing mother to a bedpost, and held</p>
<p>away from her the infant crying for her breast; and when she opened
her mouth to plead with them they spat into her mouth. 98</p>
<p>This holy terror of 1685, Michelet thought, was far worse than
the</p>
<p>Revolutionary Terror of 1793.“ Some 400,00 0 “converts” were forced
to attend Mass and receive the Eucharist; a few who spat out the
consecrated wafers when they left the church were condemned to be burned
alive. 100 Obstinate Huguenot males were imprisoned in subterranean
dungeons or unheated cells. Obdurate Huguenot women were sent to
confinement in convents, where they received unexpectedly merciful
treatment from the nuns. 101</p>
<p>Two provinces resisted with special valor. Of the Vaudois in
French</p>
<p>Dauphine and Savoyard Piedmont we shall hear later. In the valleys of
the Cevennes range in Languedoc thousands of “converted” Huguenots
secretly retained their faith, waiting for time and chance to free them;
and their “prophets,” claiming divine inspiration, assured them that the
time was near at hand. When the War of the Spanish Succession seemed to
absorb French arms, the peasants formed rebel groups of “Camisards,” who
donned white shirts to be recognized by one another at night. In one
foray they killed the Abbe du Chayla, who had persecuted them with
special ardor. A regiment of soldiery suddenly came down upon them,
massacred them indiscriminately, and destroyed their houses and crops
(1702). A remnant fought back ferociously until the conciliatory methods
of Marechal de Villars pursuaded them to peace.</p>
<p>Of the 1,500,000 Huguenots who had been living in France in 1660,</p>
<p>some 400,000, in the decade before and after the Revocation, escaped
across guarded borders at the risk of their lives. A thousand tales of
heroism survived for a century from those desperate years. Protestant
countries welcomed the fugitives. Geneva, a city of sixteen thousand
souls, found room for four thousand Huguenots. Charles II and James II,
despite their Catholicism, offered Huguenots material aid, and eased
their absorption into English economic and political life. The Elector
of Brandenburg gave them so friendly a reception that by 1697 over a
fifth of Berlin’s popula - tion was French. Holland opened its doors,
built a thousand homes to house the newcomers, lent them money to set up
business, and guaranteed them all the rights of citizenship; Dutch
Catholics joined Protestants and Jews in raising funds for Huguenot
relief. The grateful refugees not only enriched industry and trade in
the United Provinces, they enlisted in Dutch and English armies fighting
France. Some of them accompanied</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>or followed William III to England to help him against James II;
the</p>
<p>French Calvinist Marshal Schomberg, who had won victories for Louis
XIV, led an English army against the French, and died in defeating them
in the battle of the Boyne (1690). Everywhere in these hospitable lands
the Huguenots brought their skills in crafts, commerce and finance; all
Protestant Europe profited from the victory of Catholicism in France. An
entire quarter of London was occupied by French silk workers.</p>
<p>Huguenot exiles in England became interpreters of English thought to
France, and prepared the conquest of the French mind by Bacon, Newton,
and Locke.</p>
<p>A minority of French Catholics privately condemned the massacres of
the Revocation, and gave secret help and refuge to many victims. But the
vast majority hailed the destruction of the H uguenots as the King’s
culmi - nating achievement; now at last, they said, France was Catholic
and one. The greatest writers — Bossuet, Fenelon, La Fontaine, La Bruy
ere, even the Jansenist patriarch Amauld — extolled the courage of the
King in im- plem enting what they conceived to be the national will.
“Nothing could be finer,” wrote Mme. de Sevigne; “no king has done or
will do anything more memorable.” 102 Louis himself was happy at having
apparently com - pleted a disagreeable but holy task. Says
Saint-Simon:</p>
<p>He believed himself to have renewed the days of the preaching of</p>
<p>the Apostles . . . The bishops wrote panegyrics of him, the

in</p>

<p>tyrants and heathen had acted against the truth, the confessors, and

<p>rilege. 103</p>
<p>Saint-Simon and Vauban were among the few Frenchmen who realized, at
the outset, the economic loss to France through the exodus of so many
industrious citizens. Caen lost its textile manufactures, Lyon and Tours
lost three fourths of their silk looms. Of sixty paper mills in the
province of Angoumois only sixteen remained; of 109 shops in the town of
Mezieres eight survived; of four hundred tanneries in Tours, fifty-four
were left. 104 Ports like Marseilles declined through the loss of
markets in countries that now, by the work and instructions of
Huguenots, produced what formerly they had imported from France. The
great reconstruction of the French economy by Colbert was partly undone;
the industries that he had labored to develop in France went to nourish
her competitors. As revenues from industry were sharply reduced, the
government fell back into the hands of the moneylenders from whom
Colbert had rescued it. The French navy</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>lost nine thousand sailors, the army six hundred officers and twelve
thou- sand troops; perhaps this depletion shared in the defeats that
almost shat- tered France in the War of the Spanish Succession. And the
will of</p>
<p>Protestant Europe to unite against France had been strengthened by
the ominous barbarity of the persecution, and by the pleas of the
emigres.</p>
<p>The Revocation may have been indirectly helpful to the arts, the man-
ners, and the graces of life in France. The Calvinistic spirit,
distrusting adornment, graven images, and levity, discouraged art,
elegance, and wit; a Puritan France would have been an anomaly and a
mistake. But the Revocation was a disaster for French religion. Bacon
had remarked that the spec tacle of the religious wars would have made
Lucretius “seven times more epicure and atheist than he was”; 105 what
would he have said now? No stopping point was left for the Gallic mind
between Catholicism and unbelief. Whereas in Switzerland, Germany,
Holland, and England Protestantism had served to express rebellion
against the Church, no such vehicle of resentment remained in France;
the reaction against Romanism found it safer to be thoroughly skeptical
than openly Protestant. The French Renaissance, unimpeded by
Protestantism, passed directly into the Enlightenment after the death of
the King.</p>

<li>bossuet: 1627-88</li>
</ol>
<p>For the present, however, the French Church was triumphant, and stood
at the summit of splendor and authority. Intolerant in its corporate
spirit, and cruel in its power, it had nonetheless the best-educated
body of men in Europe, and its tyrants were rivaled by its saints.
Several of its bishops</p>
<p>were humanitarians sincerely devoted to the public good as they saw
it; and two of them entered almost as brilliantly as Pascal, and in
their time more prominently, into the literature of France. Rarely had
French ec- clesiastics rivaled the prestige of Bossuet, or the
popularity of Fenelon.</p>
<p>Jacques Benigne Bossuet (whose middle name better fitted Fenelon) was
bom prosperous to a prominent lawyer and member of the Parlement of
Dijon (1627). His parents dedicated him to the priesthood, had him</p>
<p>tonsured at eight, and made him at thirteen a canon in the cathedral
of Metz. At fifteen he was sent to the College de Navarre in Paris. At
six- teen he was already so eloquent that the bluestockings at the Hotel
de Rambouillet persuaded him, shyly proud, to preach a sermon to them in
mid-salon. Graduating with honors, he returned to Metz, was ordained,
and soon advanced to a doctorate in theology. He was scandalized to find
that ten thousand of Metz’s thirty thousand souls were God -damned Prot-
estants. He entered into a polite controversy with Paul Ferry, a
Huguenot</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap, n</p>
<p>leader; he admitted some evils in Catholic practice, but argued that
schism was a greater evil still. He remained on friendly terms with
Ferry for twelve years, just as, later, he was to labor amicably with
Leibniz for a reunion of Christendom. Anne of Austria, hearing him
preach at Metz, thought him too good for so unseemly an environment, and
persuaded the King to invite him to Paris. Thither he moved in 1659.</p>
<p>At first he preached to simple audiences in the Monastery of
St.-Lazare, under the auspices of Vincent de Paul. In 1660 he addressed
the fashion- able congregation at the Church of Les Minimes near the
Place Royale. The King heard him, and recognized in the young orator a
judicious union of eloquence, orthodoxy, and strong character. He
invited him to preach the Lenten sermons of 1662 in the Louvre; he
attended these discourses with conspicuous piety, except on the Sunday
when he galloped off to recapture Louise de La Valliere from a convent.
The presence of the King stimulated Bossuet to clear his style of
provincial crudities, scholastic scaffolding, and dialectical argument;
the refinement of the court passed to the upper clergy, and generated an
age of pulpit eloquence rivaling the forensic oratory of Demosthenes and
Cicero. During the next eight years Bossuet made himself the favorite
preacher in the chapels of the court. He became director of conscience
to highborn ladies like Henrietta</p>
<p>“Madame” d’Orleans, Mme. de Longueville, and Mile, de Montpensier.
106 Sometimes in his sermons he addressed the King directly, usually
with excessive flattery, once with an earnest call to abandon his
adulteries and return to his wife. For a while he forfeited the royal
smile, but he regained it by converting Turenne. In 1667 Louis chose him
to deliver the funeral oration at the burial of Anne of Austria. Two
years later he preached over the remains of Henrietta Maria, dowager
Queen of England, and in 1670 he had the melancholy task of delivering
the burial sermon for the younger Henrietta, his beloved penitent, who
had died in his arms in the precarious charm of her youth.</p>
<p>Those sermons over the mother and the sister of England’s Charles II
are the most renowned in the literature of France — for the still more
famous address of Pope Urban II, calling Europe to the First Crusade
(1095), was spoken in Latin, though on French soil. The earlier of these
oraisons funebres began with Bossuet’s brave and favorite theme:
that</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>and the disorder of morals that results from the disturbance of
faith; the Great Rebellion had been God’s punishment for England’s
apostasy from Rome. But how exemplary had been the behavior of the Queen
after the horrible and criminal execution of her husband! She had
accepted her sorrows as an atonement and a blessing, had thanked God for
them, and had lived for eleven years in humble and patient prayer. At
last she had been rewarded; her son was restored to his throne, and the
Queen Mother might again have dwelt in palaces. She had preferred to
live in a convent in France, making no use of her new fortune except to
multiply her</p>
<p>charities.</p>
<p>More moving, and closer to history and French memories, was the</p>
<p>sermon that Bossuet delivered ten months later over Henrietta Anne.
He had recently been made bishop of Condom in southwest France; for this
oration he came to the abbey church of St.-Denis in full episcopal
state, preceded by heralds and crowned with the miter; and on his finger
shone the great emerald given him by the dead princess. Usually, in
these sermons, the emotion of the speaker had been checked by his
thinking of death in general terms; now it was the death of one who only
yesterday had been the joy of the King and the radiance of the court;
and the stately prelate broke into tears as he recalled the bitter
suddenness of the blow that had set all France mourning and marveling at
the ways of God. He described Henrietta with no cold objectivity, but
with the prejudice of love — “always sweet and peaceful, generous and
benevolent” 107 — and he merely hinted, with discreet brevity, that her
happiness had not been proportioned to her deserts. For a moment even
the careful bishop, pillar and guardian of orthodoxy, dared to ask God
why so much evil and</p>
<p>injustice flourish on the earth. 108 He consoled himself and his
auditors with the remembrance of Henrietta’s dying piety, of the
sacraments that had cleansed her of all worldly attachments; surely so
tender and purified a spirit merited salvation, and would grace Paradise
itself!</p>
<p>It was through a rare mistake in judging character that Louis, moved
by such eloquence, appointed Bossuet (1670) preceptor to the Dauphin,
and trusted him to train the stolid, backward lad in the knowledge and
char- acter required to rule France. Bossuet gave himself faithfully to
this task; he resigned his bishopric to be near his wacd and the court,
and he wrote for the young Louis such earnest manuals of world history,
logic, the Christian faith, government, and the duties of a king, as
should have made the boy a monster of perfection and power.</p>
<p>In one of these treatises, Politique thee des propres paroles de
FBcriture sainte (1679, 1709) — Politics as Drawn from the Very Words of
Holy Scripture — Bossuet defended absolute monarchy and the divine right
of kings with more than the ardor of Cardinal Bellarmine upholding
the</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>supremacy of the popes. Was it not said in the Old Testament that
“God has given to every people its ruler”? 109 And in the New Testament,
with all the authority of St. Paul, that “the powers that be are
ordained of God”? 110 Yes, and the Apostle had added: “Whosoever,
therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they
that resist shall re- ceive to themselves eternal damnation.” Obviously,
anyone who accepts the Bible as the word of God must honor the king as
God’s vice -regent, or, as Isaiah called Cyrus, “the anointed of the
Lord.” 111 Consequentl y the royal person is sacred, the royal power is
divine and absolute, the king is responsible only to God. But that
responsibility lays upon him severe obligations: he must in every word
and deed obey the laws of God. Fortu- nately for Louis, the God of the
Bible had been well disposed toward polygamy.</p>
<p>For the Dauphin, too, Bossuet wrote (1679) his famous Discours sur
I’histoire universelle. Scandalized by Descartes’ suggestion that —
given one initial push by God — all events in the objective world could
be explained mechanically as following from the laws and constitution of
nature, Bossuet retorted that on the contrary every major event in
history was part of a divine plan, was an act of Providence leading up
to the sacrifice of Christ and the development of Christianity into an
expanding City of God. Again taking the Bible as divinely inspired, he
centered all history on the career of the Old Testament Jews and the
nations enlightened by Christianity. “God used the Assyrians and the
Babylonians to chastise His chosen people, the Persians to restore them,
Alexander to protect them, Antiochus to test them, the Romans to
preserve Jewish liberty against Syrian kings.” If this seems foolish, we
must remember that it was also the view of the authors of the Bible,
whom Bossuet confidently identified with God. So he began with a summary
of Old Testament history, and he performed that task with his usual
flair for order, compactness, and vigorous elo- quence. The chronology
was taken fro m Archbishop Ussher’s scheme, dating the creation at 4004
b.c. Bossuet took only passing notice of the nations that lay outside
the Biblical reference, but of these he gave synopti- cal accounts of
remarkable insight and power, and showed a sympathetic understanding of
pagan virtues and accomplishments. Through all the kaleidoscope of
rising and falling empires he saw some advance; in him, as in Charles
Perrault and other contemporary defenders of the modems versus the
ancients, the idea of progress took form and flesh, and pre- pared, from
afar off, for Turgot and Condorcet. With all its faults, the book
created the modem philosophy of history, which is achievement enough for
one man.</p>
<p>Bossuet’s royal pupil did not appreciate the honor of having great
books written for his instruction. And Bossuet’s spirit was too serious
and severe</p>

<p>to be an ingratiating teacher. He was more in his element when he
gently guided Louise de La Valliere out of adultery into a nunnery. He
preached the sermon when she took the vows; and in that year 1675 he
spoke up again in reproof of the philandering King. Louis heard him
impatiently, but restored him to the episcopate as bishop of Meaux
(1681), near enough to Versailles to let Bossuet savor the pomp and
splendor of the court. Through that proud generation he was the
authoritative exponent and leader of the French clergy. For them he drew
up the Four Articles that reaffirmed the “Gallican liberties” of the
French Church as against papal domination. Bossuet forfeited thereby a
cardinal’s hat, but he became the pope of France.</p>
<p>He was not a bad pope. Though he insisted on the dignity and ceremony
of the episcopal state, he remained humane and kind, and spread his
mantle over many varieties of Catholic belief. Without condoning the
passion and scorn that sharpened the Provincial Letters, he agreed in
condemning the excesses of casuistry; in 1700 he persuaded the assembly
of the clergy to repudiate 127 propositions taken from Jesuit casuists;
and he remained on friendly terms with Arnauld and other Jansenists. He
was reputed to be lenient in the confessional, and deprecated
austerities in laymen, but he warmly approved the asceticism of Ranee,
went into frequent retreat at La Trappe, and wished at times that he
might win the peace of a</p>
<p>monastic cell. The glamour of the court, however, overcame his
aspira- tions to sanctity, and tarnished his theology with ambitions to
rise in the hierarchies of Church and state. “Pray for me,” he asked the
abbess at Meaux, “that I may not love the world.” 112 In his later years
he became</p>
<p>Bossuet was more intolerant in theory than in practice. He thought it
absurd that any individual mind, however brilliant, should think to
acquire in one lifetime the knowledge and w’isdom fitting him to sit in
judgment upon the traditions and beliefs of the family, the community,
the state, and the Church. The sens commnn was more trustworthy than
individual reasoning; not “common sense” as the thought of common
persons, but as the collective intelligence of generations taught by
centuries of experi- ence, and taking form in the customs and creeds of
mankind. What man could pretend to know better than so many men the
needs of the human soul, and the answers to questions unanswerable by
knowledge alone? Consequently the human mind needs an authority to give
it peace, and free thought can only destroy that peace; human society
needs an authority to give it morals, and free thought, by questioning
the divine origin of</p>
<p>8o</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>the moral code, brings the whole moral order into ruin. Hence heresy
is treason to society and the state as well as to the Church, and “those
who believe that a prince should not use force in religious matters …
are guilty of an impious error.” 113 Th e bishop favored persuasion
rather than force in the conversion of heretics, but he defended force
as a last resort, and hailed the Revocation as “the pious edict that
will give the deathblow to heresy.” In his own district he enforced the
decree with s uch lenience that the intendant reported, “Nothing can be
done in the diocese of Meaux; the weakness of the Bishop is a hindrance
to conversion.” 114 Most -oTthe Huguenots in that area persisted in
their faith.</p>
<p>He hoped to the last that argument could win even Holland, Germany,
and England to the old faith, and we shall see him negotiate for years
with Leibniz over the philosopher’s plan for reuniting the severed
segments of Christianity. In 1688 he wrote his masterpiece, Histoire des
variations des eglises protestantes, which Buckle rated as “probably the
most formidable work ever directed against Protestantism.” 118 The four
volumes were dis - tinguished by painstaking scholarship; every page was
propped up with references — a type of conscience that was just
beginning to take form. The bishop made an attempt at fairness. He
acknowledged the ecclesiastical abuses against which Luther had
rebelled; he saw much to admire in Luther’s character; but he could not
stomach the jolly coarseness that</p>
<p>It was a powerful argument, impressive with learning and eloquence,
containing pages unsurpassed in the French prose of that age except by
the polemics and Pensees of Pascal. It might have had more success if

<p>appeal to reason had not been stultified by the appeal to force in
the bar- barities of the Revocation. A hundred refutations appeared in
Protestant lands excoriating the pretense to reason in a man who
approved spoliation, banishment, confiscation, and galley slavery as
arguments for Catholic Christianity. And — asked the rejoinders — were
there not variations in Catholicism too? What century had passed without
divisions in the Church — Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, Armenian
Catholics, Uniates? Were not the Jansenists of Port-Royal at that moment
warring with their fellow Catholics of the Society of Jesus? Was not the
Gallican clergy, led by Bossuet himself, in bitter dispute with the
Ultramontanes, almost to the point of schism with Rome? Was not. Bossuet

<p>Nobly born and trebly named, Frangois de Salignac de La Mothe-Fenelon
was also orthodox and ambitious, a bishop and courtier, a royal tutor
and master of prose, but elsewise all the world away from Bossuet.
Saint-Simon was impressed:</p>
<p>A very tall, thin man, well-built, pale, with a large nose, and
eyes</p>
<p>that flashed with fire and intelligence. His physiognomy seemed</p>
<p>composed of contradictions, yet, somehow, these contradictions were
not disagreeable. It was grave yet gallant, serious yet gay; it
expressed equally the doctor, the bishop, and the aristocrat; and,
perceptible</p>
<p>above everything else, in his face as in himself, were delicacy,
modesty, and, supremely, nobility of mind. It required an effort to take
one’s</p>
<p>eyes from his face. 116</p>
<p>Michelet thought him un peu vieux des sa naissance 117 — “a bit old
from his birth” — as the fruit of the final flowering of an aging
seigneur in Peri- gord, who, over the groans of his grown sons, had
married a poor but noble demoiselle. The new son was put out of the
money by being dedicated to the Church. Brought up by his mother, he
developed an almost feminine grace of speech and delicacy of feeling.
Well educated in classical lore by a tutor and the Jesuits of Paris, he
became a scholar as well as a priest. He could bandy pagan quotations
with any heretic, and wrote a French style nervous, delicate, and
refined, at the other end of the scale from the mascu- line and rotund
oratory of Bossuet.</p>
<p>Ordained at twenty-four (1675), he was soon made superior of the</p>
<p>Convent of New Catholics, where he had the difficult task of
reconciling to the Roman faith young women recently separated from
Protestantism. They listened to him at first unwillingly, then
resignedly, then affection-</p>

<p>ately, for it was easy to fall in love with Fenelon, and he was the
only man available. In 1686 he was sent to the region of La Rochelle to
aid in the conversion of Huguenots. He approved the Revocation, but
deprecated the violence, and warned the King’ s ministers that forced
conversions would be superficial and transient. Returning to the convent
in Paris, he published (1687) a Traite de /’ education des piles, almost
Rousseauian in its advocacy of gentle methods. When the Due de
Beauvilliers was appointed by the King as governor of his eight-year-old
grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy, he called upon Fenelon to tutor the
boy (1689).</p>
<p>The young Duke was proud, headstrong, passionate, sometimes ferocious
and cruel, but possessed of a brilliant mind and a vivacious wit.
Fenelon felt that only religion could tame him; he instilled in him both
the fear and the love of God; at the same time he won the respect of his
pupil by a discipline tempered with sympathetic understanding of
adolescence. He dreamed of reforming France by forming its prospective
king. He taught the lad the absurdity of war, and the necessity of
promoting agriculture instead of discouraging the peasantry with taxes
to build luxurious cities and finance aggressive wars. In the Dialogues
of the Dead that he wrote for his pupil he stigmatized as “barbarous
that government where there are no laws but the will of one man. . . .
He who rules should be pre-eminently obedient to the law; detached from
the law, his person is nothing.” A ll wars are civil wars, since all men
are brothers; “each one owes infinitely more to the human race — which
is the great country — than to the particular coun- try in which he was
born.” 118 The King, not privy to this esoteric instruc - tion, and seei
ng a wondrous improvement in his grandson’s character, rewarded Fenelon
with the archbishopric of Cambrai (1695). Fenelon put many prelates to
shame by living nine months of each year at his see. The rest he spent
at the court, anxious to influence policy, and occasionally con- tinuing
his instruction of the Duke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had met the woman who was to be, in a real sense, his
femme fatale. Mme. Jeanne Marie de La Motte-Guyon, married at sixteen,
widowed and pretty and wealthy at twenty-eight, had the world of suitors
at her feet. But she had received an intensive religious training as a
neces- sary protection against ambitious males; she had found no
adequate outlet for her piety in the external observance of Catholic
worship; and she listened responsively to the mystics of her time, who
offered peace of soul not so much through confession, Communion, and the
Mass as through absorption in the contemplation of an omnipresent deity,
a complete and loving surrender of the self to God. In such a divine
love affair no worldly matters counted; in that exaltation of the spirit
one might neglect all re- ligious ritual and yet attain to heaven not
only after death but in life as well. The Spanish priest Miguel de
Molinos had been condemned by the Inquisi-</p>

<p>THE CRUCIBLE OF FAITH</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>tion (1687) for preaching such “quietism” in Italy; but the movement
was spreading throughout Europe — in the “Pietism” of Germany and the
Netherlands, among the Quakers and the Cambridge Platonists in England,
among the devots in France.</p>
<p>Mme. Guyon, in several books, expounded her views with moving elo-
quence. Souls, she taught, are torrents that have issued from God, and
that find no quiet until they lose themselves in Him like rivers
swallowed by the sea. Then individuality fades away; there is no further
consciousness of self or the world, no consciousness at all, only
identity with God. In such a state the soul is infallible, beyond good
and evil, virtue and sin; whatever it does is right, and no force can
injure it. She could not ask forgiveness for her sins, Mme. Guyon told
Bossuet, because in her world of ecstasy there was no sin. 119 Some
ladies of the aristocracy saw in this mysticism a noble form of piety;
Mme. Guyon numbered among her disciples the Mmes. de Beau- villiers, de
Chevreuse, de Mortemart, even, in a degree, Mme. de Main- tenon. Fenelon
himself was attracted by this fascinating union of piety, wealth, and
loveliness; his own character was a complex of mysticism, am- bition,
and sentiment. He persuaded Mme. de Maintenon to let Mme. Guyon teach in
the school that the secret wife of the King had founded at St.-Cyr.
Maintenon asked her confessor to advise her about Mme. Guyon; he
consulted Bossuet, who invited the mystic to expound her doctrines to
him. She did. The cautious bishop saw in them a threat to the theology
and practices of the Church, for they seemed to dispense not only with
the sacraments and the priest, but with the Gospels and Christ. He
reproved her, gave her the Eucharist, and asked her to leave Paris and
cease teaching. At first she consented, then she refused. Bossuet had
her confined in a con- vent for eight years (1695-1703), after which she
was released on condi- tion that she live quietly on her son’s estate
near Blois. There she died in</p>
<p>uu-</p>
<p>To define the limits of permissible mysticism Bossuet composed an In-
struction on the States of Prayer (1696). He showed Fenelon a copy of
the manuscript, and asked his approval. Fenelon demurred, and wrote an
opposed work. Explanation of the Maxims of the Saints on the Internal
Life (1697). The two books, published almost simultaneously, became a
matter of widespread discussion as lively as in the furor over
Port-Royal. The King, trusting Bossuet, removed Fenelon from his
position as instructor to the Duke of Burgundy, and bade him stay in his
diocese at Cambrai Urged on by Bossuet, Louis dem anded a papal
condemnation of Fenelon’s book. Innocent XII, remembering Bossuet’s
Gallicanism and Fenelon’s Ultramontane defense of the papacy, hesitated;
pressure was brought upon him; he yielded, but condemned the Maxims as
mildly as he could (March,</p>
<p>1699). Fenelon submitted quietly.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>At Cambrai he performed his duties with a devotion and conscience
that won him the respect of France. Bossuet and the King might have been
appeased had not a printer published (April, 1699), with the consent of
the author, a romance that Fenelon had written for his royal pupil under
the apparently harmless title of Suite de I’Odicee d’ Homer e (
Continuation of Homer’s Odyssey ), known to us as Les Aventures de
Telemaque, fils d’Ulysse. Here, in a style of smooth grace and almost
feminine tenderness, the ingratiating teacher had expounded again his
idealistic political philoso- phy. Mentor, his mouthpiece, having
persuaded the kings to peace, warns them:</p>

<p>Fenelon admitted the divine right of kings, but only as a power given
them by Providence to make men happy, and as a right limited by
laws:</p>
<p>Absolute power degrades every subject to the condition of a</p>
<p>slave. The tyrant is flattered, even to the point of adoration,
and</p>
<p>everyone trembles at the glance of his eye; but at the least breath
of revolt this monstrous power perishes by its own excess. It drew
no</p>
<p>strength from the love of the people. 121</p>
<p>In these bold lines Louis XIV saw himself described and his wars con-
demned. The friends of Fenelon hastily vanished from the court. The
printer of Telemaque was arrested, and the police were told to
confiscate all copies. But the book was reprinted in Holland, and soon
it was being read throughout the French- reading world; for a century
and a half it was the most widely read, and best loved, of all French
books. 122 Fenelon pro- tested that he had not had Louis in mind in
these critical passages; no one believed him. Two years passed before
the Duke of Burgundy dared to write to his former teacher; then the King
relented, and allowed him to visit Fenelon at Cambrai. The Archbishop
lived in hopes that his pupil would soon inherit the throne, and might
then call upon him to be his</p>

<p>Richelieu. But the grandson died three years before the King; and
Fenelon himself (January 7, 1715) preceded Louis by nine months to the
grave.</p>
<p>Bossuet had gone long before them. He was unhappy in his later years;
he had triumphed against Fenelon, the Ultramontanes, and the mystics,
and he had seen the Church triumphant against the Huguenots; but all
these vic- tories could not enable him to pass the stones from his
bladder. Pain so racked him that he could hardly bear to take the place
he so loved to hold in the ceremonies of the court; and heartless cynics
asked why he could not go and die privately at Meaux. He saw about him
the rise of skepticism, of Biblical criticism, of Protestant polemics
impiously aimed at his own head; here, for example, was Jurieu, the
banished Huguenot, telling the world that he, Bossuet, the bishop of
bishops and the very image of virtue and probity, was a ranting liar
living with concubines. 123 He began some new books to rout these
scurrilous foes, but life ran out on him as he wrote; and on April 12,
1704, his pains ceased.</p>
<p>At first sight Bossuet seems to mark the zenith of Catholicism in
modern France. The old faith appeared to have recovered all the ground
that had been lost to Luther and Calvin. The clergy were reforming’
their morals, Racine was devoting his final dramas to religion, Pascal
had turned skep- ticism upon the skeptics, the state had made itself an
obedient agent of the Church, the King had become almost a Jesuit.</p>
<p>And yet the situation was not perfect. The Jesuits were still under
the cloud raised by the Lettres A un provincial; Jansenism was not
destroyed; the Huguenot fugitives were stirring up half of Europe
against the pious King; Montaigne was read more widely than Pascal; and
Hobbes, Spinoza, and Bayle were striking terrible blows at the edifice
of faith. According to St. Vincent de Paul (1648), “several pastors
complain that they have fewer communicants than before; St.-Sulpice
three thousand less; the pastor of St.-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet found that
1,500 of his parishioners had omitted Easter communion.” 124 Said Bayle
in 1686: “The age we live in is full of freethinkers and deists; people
are amazed at their number”; 128 “a prodigious indifference to religion
reigns everywhere”; 126 and he attributed</p>

<p>epitomizer Bernier, the Dues de Nevers and de Bouillon. The Temple,
once the headquarters of the Knights Templar in Paris, became the center
of a little group of freethinkers — Chaulieu, Sirvien, La Fare, etc. —
who passed down their irreverence to the Regency. And Fontenelle, the
indestructible near-centenarian destined to bandy quips with the
Encyclopedists, was al- ready in 1687 publishing his Histoire des
oracles, slyly undermining the miraculous basis of Christianity. In the
ecstasy of his piety Louis XIV had cleared the road for Voltaire.</p>
