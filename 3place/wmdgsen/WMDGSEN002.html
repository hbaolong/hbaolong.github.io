<p>The Conditions of Civilization*</p>
<p>Definition — Geological conditions — Geographical — Economic —</p>
<p>Racial — Psy chological — Causes of the decay of civilizations</p>
<p>C IVILIZATION is social order promoting cultural creation. Four</p>
<p>elements constitute it: economic provision, political
organization,</p>
<p>moral traditions, and the pursuit of knowledge and the arts. It
begins where chaos and insecurity end. For when fear is overcome,
curiosity and constructiveness are free, and man passes by natural
impulse towards the understanding and embellishment of life.</p>
<p>Certain factors condition civilization, and may encourage or impede
it. First, geological conditions. Civilization is an interlude between
ice ages: at any time the current of glaciation may rise again, cover
with ice and stone the works of man, and reduce life to some narrow
segment of the earth. Or the demon of earthquake, by whose leave we
build our cities, may shrug his shoulders and consume us
indifferently.</p>
<p>Second, geographical conditions. The heat of the tropics, and the in-
numerable parasites that infest them, are hostile to civilization;
lethargy and disease, and a precocious maturity and decay, divert the
energies from those inessentials of life that make civilization, and
absorb them in hunger and reproduction; nothing is left for the play of
the arts and the mind. Rain is necessary; for water is the medium of
life, more important even than the light of the sun; the unintelligible
whim of the elements may condemn to desiccation regions that once
flourished with empire and in- dustry, like Nineveh or Babylon, or may
help to swift strength and wealth cities apparently off the main line of
transport and communication, like those of Great Britain or Puget Sound.
If the soil is fertile in food or</p>
<p>minerals, if rivers offer an easy avenue of exchange, if the
coast-line is indented with natural harbors for a commercial fleet, if,
above all, a nation lies on the highroad of the world’s trade, like
Athens or Carthage, Flor -</p>

<li>The reader will find, at the end of this volume, a glossary defining
foreign terms, a bibliography with guidance for further reading, a
pronouncing index, and a body of references corresponding to the
superior figures in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>ence or Venice — then geography, though it can never create it,
smiles upon civilization, and nourishes it.</p>
<p>Economic conditions are more important. A people may possess or-
dered institutions, a lofty moral code, and even a flair for the minor
forms of art, like the American Indians; and yet if it remains in the
hunting stage, if it depends for its existence upon the precarious
fortunes of the chase, it will never quite pass from barbarism to
civilization. A nomad stock, like the Bedouins of Arabia, may be
exceptionally intelligent and vigorous, it may display high qualities of
character like courage, generosity and nobility; but without that simple
sine qua non of culture, a continuity of food, its intelligence will be
lavished on the perils of the hunt and the tricks of trade, and nothing
will remain for the laces and frills, the curtsies and amenities, the
arts and comforts, of civilization. The first form of culture is
agriculture. It is when man settles down to till the soil and lay up
pro- visions for the uncertain future that he finds time and reason to
be civilized. Within that little circle of security — a reliable supply
of water and food — he builds his huts, his temples and his schools; he
invents productive tools, and domesticates the dog, the ass, the pig, at
last himself. He learns to work with regularity and order, maintains a
longer tenure of life, and transmits more completely than before the
mental and moral heritage of his race.</p>
<p>Culture suggests agriculture, but civilization suggests the city. In
one aspect civilization is the habit of civility; and civility is the
refinement which townsmen, who made the word, thought possible only in
the civitas or city.* For in the city are gathered, rightly or wrongly,
the</p>
<p>wealth and brains produced in the countryside; in the city invention
and industry multiply comforts, luxuries and leisure; in the city
traders meet, and barter goods and ideas; in that cross-fertilization of
minds at the cross- roads of trade intelligence is sharpened and
stimulated to creative power. In the city some men are set aside from
the making of material things, and produce science and philosophy,
literature and art. Civilization begins in the peasant’s hut, but it
comes to flower only in the towns.</p>
<p>There are no racial conditions to civilization. It may appear on
any</p>
<p>continent and in any color: at Pekin or Delhi, at Memphis or Babylon,
at Ravenna or London, in Peru or Yucatan. It is not the great race that
makes</p>
<p>• The word civilization (Latin civilis — pertaining to the civis,
citizen) is comparatively young. Despite Boswell’s suggestion Johnson
refused to admit it to his Dictionary in 1772; he preferred to use the
word civility ?</p>
<p>CHAP, i) THE CONDITIONS OF CIVILIZATION 3</p>
<p>the civilization, it is the great civilization that makes the people;
circum- stances geographical and economic create a culture, and the
culture creates a type. The Englishman does not make British
civilization, it makes him; if he carries it with him wherever he goes,
and dresses for dinner in Timbuktu, it is not that he is creating his
civilization there anew, but that he acknowledges even there its mastery
over his soul. Given like ma- terial conditions, and another race would
beget like results; Japan repro- duces in the twentieth century the
history of England in the nineteenth. Civilization is related to race
only in the sense that it is often preceded by the slow intermarriage of
different stocks, and their gradual assimilation into a relatively
homogeneous people.*</p>
<p>These physical and biological conditions are only prerequisites to
civ- ilization; they do not constitute or generate it. Subtle
psychological</p>
<p>factors must enter into play. There must be political order, even if
it be so near to chaos as in Renaissance Florence or Rome; men must
feel, by and large, that they need not look for death or taxes at every
turn. There must be some unity of language to serve as a medium of
mental exchange. Through church, or family, or school, or otherwise,
there must be a uni- fying moral code, some rules of the game of life
acknowledged even by those who violate them, and giving to conduct some
order and regularity, some direction and stimulus. Perhaps there must
also be some unity of basic belief, some faith, supernatural or utopian,
that lifts morality from calcu- lation to devotion, and gives life
nobility and significance despite our mortal brevity. And finally there
must be education — some technique, however primitive, for the
transmission of culture. Whether through imi- tation, initiation or
instruction, whether through father or mother, teacher or priest, the
lore and heritage of the tribe — its language and knowledge, its morals
and manners, its technology and arts — must be handed down to the young,
as the very instrument through which they are turned from animals into
men.</p>
<p>The disappearance of these conditions — sometimes of even one of them
— may destroy a civilization. A geological cataclysm or a profound cli-
matic change; an uncontrolled epidemic like that which wiped out half
the population of the Roman Empire under the Antonines, or the Black
Death that helped to end the Feudal Age; the exhaustion of the land, or
the ruin</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood, as distinct from race, may affect a civilization in the sense
that a nation may be retarded or advanced by breeding from the
biologically (not racially) worse or better strains among the
people.</li>
</ul>
<p>4 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. I</p>
<p>of agriculture through the exploitation of the country by the town,
result- ing in a precarious dependence upon foreign food supplies; the
failure of natural resources, either of fuels or of raw materials; a
change in trade routes, leaving a nation off the main line of the
world’s commerce; mental or moral decay from the strains, stimuli and
contacts of urban life, from the breakdown of traditional sources of
social discipline and the inability to replace them; the weakening of
the stock by a disorderly sexual life, or by an epicurean, pessimist, or
quietist philosophy; the decay of leadership through the infertility of
the able, and the relative smallness of the fami- lies that might
bequeath most fully the cultural inheritance of the race; a pathological
concentration of wealth, leading to class wars, disruptive revolutions,
and financial exhaustion: these are some of the ways in which a
civilization may die. For civilization is not something inborn or imper-
ishable; it must be acquired anew by every generation, and any serious
interruption in its financing or its transmission may bring it to an
end. Man differs from the beast only by education, which may be defined
as the technique of transmitting civilization.</p>
<p>Civilizations are the generations of the racial soul. As
family-rearing, and then writing, bound the generations together,
handing down the lore of the dying to the young, so print and commerce
and a thousand ways of communication may bind the civilizations
together, and preserve for future cultures all that is of value for them
in our own. Let us, before we die, gather up our heritage, and offer it
to our children.</p>
