<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>The Scientific Advance*</p>
<p>1715-89</p>
<p>I. THE EXPANDING QUEST</p>
<p>S CIENCE too was offering a new revelation. The growth of science —
of its pursuit, its methods, its findings, its successful predictions
and productions, its power, and its prestige — is the positive side of
that basic modem development whose negative side is the decline of
supernatural belief. Two priesthoods came into conflict: the one devoted
to the molding of character through religion, the other to the education
of the intellect through science. The first priesthood predominates in
ages of poverty or disaster, when men are grateful for spiritual comfort
and moral order; the second in ages of progressive wealth, when men
incline to limit their hopes to the earth.</p>
<p>It is customary to rank the eighteenth century below the seventeenth
in scientific achievements; and certainly there are no figures here that
tower like Galileo or Newton, no accomplishments commensurate with the
en- largement of the known universe or the cosmic extension of
gravitation, or the formulation of calculus, or the discovery of the
circulation of the blood. And yet, what a galaxy of stars brightens the
scientific scene in the eight- eenth century! — Euler and Lagrange in
mathematics, Herschel and Laplace in astronomy, d’Alembert, Franklin,
Galvani, and Volta in physics, Priest - ley and Lavoisier in chemistry,
Linnaeus in botany, Buffon and Lamarck in biology, Haller in physiology,
John Hunter in anatomy, Condillac in psychology, Jenner and Boerhaave in
medicine. The multiplying academies gave more and more of their time and
funds to scientific research. The uni- versities increasingly admitted
science to their curriculums; between 1702 and 1750 Cambridge
established chairs in anatomy, astronomy, botany, chemistry, geology,
and “experimental philosophy”— i.e., physics. Scien- tific method became
more rigorously experimental. The nationalistic ani- mosity that had
tarnished the International of the Mind in the controversy between
Newton and Leibniz subsided, and the new priesthood joined hands across
frontiers, theologies, and wars to explore the expanding un- known.
Recruits came from every class, from the impoverished Priestley</p>
<p>•This chapter is especially indebted to A. Wolfs History of Science,
Technology, and Philosophy in the 18th Century.</p>
<p>5 ° 7</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>and the foundling d’Alembert to the titled Bu ffon and the
millionaire La- voisier. Kings and princes entered the quest: George III
took up botany, John V astronomy, Louis XVI physics. Amateurs like
Montesquieu and Voltaire, women like Mme. du Chatelet and the actress
Mile. Clairon la- bored or played in laboratories, and Jesuit scientists
like Boscovich strove to unite the old faith and the new.</p>
<p>Not till our own explosive times did science enjoy such popularity
and honor. The eclat of Newton’s discoveries in mathematics, mechanics,
and astronomy had raised the heads of scientists everywhere in Europe.
They could not rise to be master of the mint, but on the Continent,
after 1750, they were welcomed in scented society and rubbed wigs with
lords and dukes. In Paris the lecture halls of science were crowded by
eager listen- ers of all sexes and ranks. Goldsmith, visiting Paris in
1755, reported, “I have seen as bright a circle of beauty at the
chemical lectures of Rouelle as gracing the court of Versailles.” 1
Fashionable women ke pt books of science on their dressing tables, and,
like Mme. de Pompadour, had their portraits painted with squares and
telescopes at their feet. People lost interest in theology, they
sloughed off the other world while cherishing their super- stitions.
Science became the mode and mood of an age that moved in a complex
stream of hectic change to its catastrophic end.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>MATHEMATICS</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Euler</li>
</ol>
<p>Change was now slow in mathematics because so much had already been
done in that field through five millenniums that Newton seemed to have
left no other regions to conquer. For a while, after his death (1727), a
re- action set in against the assumptions and abstruseness of calculus.
Bishop Berkeley, in a vigorous critique ( The Analyst , 1734), assailed
these as quite equaling the mysteries of metaphysics and theology, and
taunted the followers of science with “submitting to authority, taking
things on trust, and believing points inconceivable,” precisely as had
been charged against the followers of religious faith. Mathematicians
have been as hard put to answer him on this head as materialists have
been to refute his idealism.</p>
<p>However, mathematics built bridges, and the pursuit of numbers con-
tinued. In England Abraham Demoivre, Nicholas Saunderson, and Brook
Taylor, and in Scotland Colin Maclaurin, developed the Newtonian form of
calculus. Demoivre advanced the mathematics of chance and of life an-
nuities; being of French birth and English residence, he was chosen by
the Royal Society of London (1712) to arbitrate the rival claims of
Newton</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE 509</p>
<p>and Leibniz to the invention of infinitesimal calculus. Saunderson
became blind at the age of one; he learned to carry on long and
complicated mathe- matical problems mentally; he was appointed professor
of mathematics at Cambridge at the age of twenty-nine (1711), and wrote
an Algebra that won international acclaim; we shall see how his career
fascinated Diderot. Taylor left his name on a basic theorem of calculus,
and Maclaurin showed that a liquid mass rotating on its axis would take
an ellipsoidal form.</p>
<p>In Basel the Bernoulli family continued through three generations to
produce distinguished scientists. Protestant in faith, the family had
fled from Antwerp (1583) to avoid the atrocities of Alva. Two of seven
Bernoulli mathematicians belong to the age of Louis XIV; a third, Johann
I (1667-</p>
<p>1748), overspread two reigns. Daniel (1700-82) became professor of
mathematics at St. Petersburg at the age of twenty-five, but returned
eight years later to teach anatomy, botany, physics, and finally
philosophy in the University of Basel; he left works on calculus,
acoustics, and astron- omy, and almost founded mathematical physics. His
brother Johann II (1710-90) taught rhetoric and mathematics, and left
his mark on the theory of heat and light. Daniel won prizes of the
Academie des Sciences ten times, Johann thrice. Of Johann’s sons, Johann
III (1744 -1807) became astronomer royal at the Berlin Academy, and
Jakob II ( 1758? — 89) taught physics at Basel, mathematics at
St. Petersburg. This remarkable family spanned the curriculum, the
century, and the Continent.</p>
<p>Leonhard Euler, pupil of Johann Bernoulli I and friendly rival of
Daniel, stands out as the most versatile and prolific mathematician of
his time. Born at Basel in 1707, dying at St. Petersburg in 1783,
eminent in mathematics, mechanics, optics, acoustics, hydrodynamics,
astronomy, chemistry, and medicine, and knowing half the Aeneid by
heart, he illustrated the uses of diversity and the scope of the human
mind. In three major treatises on cal- culus he freed the new science
from the geometric placenta in which it had been born, and established
it as algebraic calculus — “analysis.” To these classics he added works
on algebra, mechanics, astronomy, and music; how- ever, his Tentamen
novae Theoriae Musicae (1729) “contained too much geometry for
musicians, and too much music for geometers.” 2 With all his science he
retained his religious faith to the end.</p>
<p>When Daniel Bernoulli moved to St. Petersburg he promised to get</p>
<p>Leonhard a post in the Academy there. The youth went, aged twenty;
and when Daniel left Russia (1733) Euler succeeded him as head of the
mathe- matical section. He astonished his fellow Academicians by
computing in three days astronomical tables that were expected to
require several months. On this and other tasks he worked so intensely,
night and day and by poor light, that in 1735 he lost the sight of his
right eye. He married, and began at once to add and multiply, while
death subtracted; of his thirteen chil-</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>dren eight died young. His own life was not safe in a capital racked
with political intrigue and assassinations. In 1741 he accepted an
invitation from Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy; there,
in 1759, he suc- ceeded Maupertuis in charge of mathemat ics.
Frederick’s mother liked him, but found him strangely reticent. “Why
don’t you speak to me?” she asked. “Madame,” he replied, “I come from a
country where if you speak you are hanged.” 2 3 The Russians, however,
could be gentlemen. They continued h is salary for a long time after his
departure; and when a Russian army, invad- ing Brandenburg, pillaged
Euler’s farm, the general indemnified him hand - somely, and the Empress
Elizabeth Petrovna added to the sum.</p>
<p>The history of science honors Euler first for his work in calculus,
and especially for his systematic treatment of the calculus of
variations. He ad- vanced both geometry and trigonometry as branches of
analysis. He was the first to distinctly conceive the notion of a
mathematical function, which is now the heart of mathematics. In
mechanics he formulated the general equations that still bear his name.
In optics he was the first to apply calculus to the vibrations of light,
and to formulate the curve of vibration as dependent upon elasticity and
density. He deduced the laws of refraction analytically, and made those
studies in the dispersion of light that prepared for the construction of
achromatic lenses. He shared in the international enterprise of finding
longitude at sea by charting the position of the planets and the phases
of the moon; his approximate solution helped John Harrison to draw up
successful lunar tables for the British Admiralty.</p>
<p>In 1766 Catherine the Great asked Euler to return to St. Petersburg.
He did, and she treated him royally. Soon after his arrival he became
totally blind. His memory was so accurate, and his speed of calculation
so great, that he continued to produce almost as actively as before. Now
he dictated his Complete Introduction to Algebra to a young tailor who,
when this be- gan, knew nothing of mathematics beyond simple reckoning;
this book gave to algebra the form that it retained to our time. In 1771
a fire destroyed Euler’s home; the blind mathematici an was saved from
the flames by a fel- low Swiss from Basel, Peter Grimm, who carried him
on his shoulders to safety. Euler died in 1783, aged seventy-six, from a
stroke suffered while playing with a grandson.</p>
<p>2 . Lagrange</p>
<p>Only one man surpassed him in his century and science, and that was
his protege. Joseph Louis Lagrange was one of eleven children born to a
French couple domiciled in Turin; of these eleven he alone survived in-
fancy. He was turned from the classics to science by reading a memoir
ad-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5 ”</p>
<p>dressed by Halley to the Royal Society of London; at once he devoted
him- self to mathematics, and soon with such success that at the age of
eighteen he was professor of geometry at the Turin Artillery Academy.
From his students, nearly all older than himself, he organized a
research society that grew into the Turin Academy of Science. At
nineteen he sent to Euler a new method for treating the calculus of
variations; Euler replied that this procedure solved difficulties which
he himself had been unable to over- come. The kindly Swiss delayed
making public his own results, “so as not to deprive you of any part of
the glory which is your due.” 4 Lagrange an - nounced his method in the
first volume issued by the Turin Academy (1759). Euler, in his own
memoir on the calculus of variations, gave the younger man full credit;
and in that year 1759 he had him elected a for- eign member of the
Berlin Academy, at the age of twenty-three. When Euler left Prussia he
recommended Lagrange as his successor at the Acad- emy; d’Alembert
warmly seconded the proposal; and in 1766 Lagrange moved to Berlin. He
greeted Frederick II as “the greatest king in Europe”; Frederick
welcomed him as “the greatest mathematician in Europe.” 5 This was
premature, but it soon became true. The friendly relations among the
leading mathematicians of the eighteenth century — Euler, Lagrange,
Clai- rau t, d’Alembert, and Legendre— form a pleasant episode in the
history of science.</p>
<p>During his twenty years at Berlin Lagrange gradually put together his
masterpiece, Mecanique analytique. Incidentally to this basic enterprise
he delved into astronomy, an d offered a theory of Jupiter’s satellites
and an explanation of lunar librations — alterations in the visible
portions of the moon. In 1786 Frederick the Great died, and was
succeeded by Frederick William II, who cared little for science.
Lagrange accepted an invitation from Louis XVI to join the Academie des
Sciences; he was given comfortable quarters in the Louvre, and became a
special favorite of Marie Antoinette, who did what she could to lighten
his frequent spells of melancholy. He brought with him the manuscript of
Mecanique analytique, but he could find no publisher for so difficult a
printing problem in a city seething with revolution. His friends Adrien
Legendre and the Abbe Marie finally pre- vailed upon a printer to
undertake the task, but only after the abbe had promised to buy all
copies unsold after a stated date. When the book that summed up his life
work was placed in Lagrange’s hands (1788), he did not care to look at
it; he was in one of those periodic depressions in which he lost all
interest in mathematics, even in life. For two years the book re- mained
unopened on his desk.</p>
<p>The Mecanique analytique is rated by general consent as the summit of
eighteenth-century mathematics. Second only to the Principia in their
fiel d, it advanced upon Newton’s book by using “analysis”— algebraic
cal-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>cuius — instead of geometry in the discovery and exposition of
solutions; said the preface, “No diagrams will be found in this work.”
By t his method Lagrange reduced mechanics to general formulas — the
calculus of variations — from which specific equations could be derived
for each particular prob- lem; these general equations still dominate
mechanics, and bear his name. Ernst Mach described them as one of the
greatest contributions ever made to the economy of thought. 6 They
raised Alfred North Whitehead to re- ligious ecstasy: “The beauty and
almost divine simplicity of these equations is such that these formulae
are worthy to rank with those mysterious sym- bols which in ancient
times were held directly to indicate the Supreme Rea- son at the base of
all things.” 7</p>
<p>When the Revolution broke out with the fall of the Bastille (July
14.</p>
<p>1789), Lagrange, as a favorite of royalty, was advised to return to
Berlin; he refused. He had always sympathized with the oppressed, but he
had no faith in the ability of revolution to escape the results of the
natural inequal- ity of men. He was horrified by the massacres of
September, 1792, and the execution of his friend Lavoisier, but his
moody silence saved him from the guillotine. When the f’cole Normale was
opened (1795) Lagrange was put in charge of mathematics; when that
school was closed and the £cole Poly- technique was established (1797),
he was its first professor; the mathemati- cal basis and bent of French
education are part of Lagrange’s enduring in - fluence.</p>
<p>In 1791 a committee was appointed to devise a new system of weights
and measures; Lagrange, Lavoisier, and Laplace were among its first mem-
bers; two of this trinity were “purged” after three months, and Lagrange
became the leading spirit in formulating the metric system. The
committee chose as the basis of length a quadrant of the earth — a
quarter of the great circle passing around the earth at sea level
through the poles; one ten-mil- lionth of this was taken as the new unit
of length, and was called a metre — a meter. A subcommittee chose as the
new unit of weight a gram: the weight of distilled water, at zero
temperature centigrade, occupying a cube each side of which measured one
centimeter — one hundredth of a meter. In this way all lengths and
weights were based upon one physical constant, and upon the number ten.
There were still many defenders of the duodecimal system, which took
twelve as its base, as in England and gen- erally in our measurement of
time. Lagrange stood firmly for ten, and had his way. The metric system
was adopted by the French government on November 25, 1792, and remains,
with some modifications, as perhaps the most lasting result of the
French Revolution.</p>
<p>Romance brightened Lagrange’s advancing age. When he was fifty -six a
girl of seventeen, daughter of his friend the astronomer Lemonnier,
insisted on marrying him and devoting herself to mitigating his
hypochondria. La-</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5*3</p>
<p>grange yielded, and became so grateful for her love that he
accompanied her to balls and musicales. He had learned to like music —
which is a trick that mathematics plays upon the ear — because “it
isolates me. I hear the first three measures; at the fourth I
distinguish nothing; I give myself up to my thoughts; nothing interrupts
me; and it is thus that I solve more than one difficult problem.” 8</p>
<p>As the fever of revolution subsided, France complimented itself on
hav- ing exempted the supreme mathematician of the age from the
guillotine. In 1796 Talleyrand was sent to Turin to wait in state upon
Lagrange’s father and tell him, “Your son, whom Piedmont is proud to
have produced, and France to possess, has done honor to all mankind by
his genius.” 9 Napoleon, between campaigns, liked to talk with the
mathematician-become-philoso- pher.</p>
<p>The old man’s interest in mathematics revived when (1810 -13) he re-
vised and enlarged the Mecanique analytique for its second edition. But
as usual he worked too hard and fast; spells of dizziness weakened him;
once his wife found him unconscious on the floor, his head bleeding from
a cut caused by his fall against, the edge of a table. He realized that
his physical resources were running out, but he accepted this gradual
disintegration as normal and reasonable. To Monge and others who
attended him he said:</p>
<p>“I was very ill yesterday, my friends. I felt I was going to die.
My</p>
<p>body grew weaker little by little; my intellectual and physical
facul-</p>
<p>ties were extinguished insensibly. I observed the well-graduated pro-
gression of the diminution of my strength, and I came to the end with-
out sorrow, without regrets, and by a very gentle decline. Death is not
to be dreaded, and when it comes without pain it is a last function</p>
<p>which is not unpleasant. . . . Death is the absolute repose of
the</p>
<p>body.” 10</p>
<p>He died on April 10, 1813, aged seventy-five, mourning only that he
had to leave his faithful wife to the hazards of that age, when it
seemed that all the world was in arms against France.</p>
<p>His friends Gaspard Monge and Adrien Legendre carried into the nine-
teenth century those mathematical researches which provided the founda-
tions of industrial advance. The work of Legendre (1752-1833) belongs to
the post-Revolution age; we merely salute him on our way. Monge was the
son of a peddler and knife-grinder; our notion of French poverty is
checked when we see this simple workingman sending three sons through
college. Gaspard took all available prizes in school. At fourteen he
built a fire engine; at sixteen he declined the invitation of his Jesuit
teachers to join their order; instead he became professor of physics and
mathematics in the Lcole Militaire at Mezieres. There he formulated the
principles of</p>
<p>5 *4</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>descriptive geometry — a system of presenting three-dimensional
figures on one descriptive plane. The procedure proved so useful in
designing fortifi- cations and other constructions that for fifteen
years the French army for- bade him to divulge it publicly. Then (1794)
he was allowed to teach it at the £cole Normale in Paris. Lagrange,
attending his lecture there, marveled like Moliere’s Jourdain: “Before
hearing Monge, I did not know that I knew descriptive geometry.” 11
Monge served the embattled republic well, and rose to be minister of the
marine. Napoleon entrusted many confiden- tial missions to him. After
the restoration of the Bourbons Monge was re- duced to insecurity and
poverty. When he died (1818) his students at the £cole Polytechnique
were forbidden to attend his funeral. The next morn- ing they marched in
a body to the cemetery and laid a wreath upon his grave.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PHYSICS</li>
</ol>
<p>1 . Matter, Motion, Heat, and Light</p>
<p>Mathematics grew because it was the basic and indispensable tool of
all science, reducing experience and experiment to quantitative
formulations that made possible precise prediction and practical
control. The first step was to apply it to matter in general: to
discover the regularities and estab- lish the “laws” of energy, motion,
heat, sound, light, magnetism, electricity; here were mysteries enough
waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis abandoned a career in the French
army to devote himself to science. He preceded Voltaire in introducing
Newton to France, and in appreciating and instructing Mme. du Chatelet.
In 1736, as we shall see, he directed an expedition to Lapland to
measure a degree of the meridian. In 1740 he accepted an invitation to
visit Frederick II; he followed Frederick into the battle of Mollwitz (
1741 ), was captured by the Austrians, but was soon released. In 1745 he
joined the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and a year later he became its
president. To the Paris Academie des Sciences in 1 744, and to the
Berlin Academy in 1 746, he ex- pounded his principle of least action:
“Whenever any change occurs in nature, the quantity of action employed
for this change is always the least possible.” This, he thought, proved
a rational order in nature, and there - fore the existence of a rational
God. 12 Euler and Lagrange developed the principle, and in our own time
it played a part in the quantum theory. In an Essai de cosmologie (1750)
Maupertuis revived an indestructible heresy: while still recognizing
design in nature, he confessed to seeing in it also signs of stupidity
or evil, as if a demon were competing with a benevolent</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE 5 1 5</p>
<p>deity in the management of the cosmos. 13 Maupertuis might have
agreed with his merciless enemy Voltaire that St. Augustine should have
re- mained a Manichaean.</p>
<p>We have noted the birth of d’Alembert as the unpremeditated issue of
a passing contact between an artilleryman and an ex-nun. The Paris
police found him, a few hours old, on the steps of the Church of
St.-Jean-le-Rond (1717); they had him baptized Jean Baptiste Le Rond,
and sent him to a nurse in the country. His father, the Chevalier
Destouches, claimed him, gave him (for reasons unknown to us) the name
d’Arembert, and paid Mme. Rousseau, a glazier’s wife, to adopt the
child. She proved a model step - mother, and Jean a model and precocious
boy. When he was seven the father proudly displayed him to the mother,
Mme. de Tencin, but she de- cided that her career as mistress and
salonniere would be impeded by ac- cepting him. She contributed nothing
to his support, so far as we know, but the Chevalier, before dying in
1726, left him an annuity of twelve hundred livres.</p>
<p>Jean studied at the College des Quatre-Nations, then at the
University of Paris, where he received the degree in law. There, about
1738, he changed his name from d’Arembert to d’Alembert. Tiring of law,
he turned to medi - cine; but an incidental interest in mathematics
became a passion: “mathe - matics,” he said, “was for me my mistress.”
14 He continued till he was forty-eight to live with Mme. Rousseau,
looking upon her gratefully as his only mother. She thought it
disgraceful that a man should so abandon him- self to study and show no
economic itch. “You will never be anything bet - ter than a
philosopher,” she mourned, adding, “And what is a ph ilosopher? ’Tis a
madman who torments himself all his life so that people may talk about
him when he is dead.” 15</p>
<p>Probably his inspiring motives were not a desire for posthumous fame
but a proud rivalry with established savants, and that beaver instinct
which takes delight in building, in forging order upon a chaos of
materi- als or ideas. In any case he began at twenty-two to submit
papers to the Academie des Sciences: one on integral calculus (1739),
another on the refraction of light (1741); this gave the earliest
explanation of the bend- ing of light rays in passing from one fluid to
another of greater density; for this the Academie admitted him to
“adjoint” membership. Two years later he published his main scientific
work, Traite de dynamique, which sought to reduce to mathematical
equations all problems of matter in mo- tion; this anticipated by forty-
two years Lagrange’s superior Mecanique analytique; it keeps historical
significance because it formulated the basic theorem now known as
“D’Alembert’s principle,” too technical for our general digestion, but
immensely helpful in mechanical calculations. He applied it in a Traite
de Fequilibre et du mouvement des fluides (1744);</p>
<p>5 1&lt;5 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>this so impressed the Academie that it awarded him a pension of five
hun- dred livres, which must have appeased Mme. Rousseau.</p>
<p>Partly from his principle, partly from an original equation in
calculus, d’Alembert arrived at a formula for the motion of wi nds. He
dedicated his Reflexions sur la cause generate des vents ( 1747 ) to
Frederick the Great, who responded by inviting him to settle in Berlin;
d’Alembert re - fused, showing at thirty more wisdom than Voltaire was
to show at fifty- six. In an Essai d’une nouvelle theorie de la
resistance des fluides (1752) he tried to find mechanical formulas for
the resistance of water to a body moving on it; he failed, but in 1775 ,
under a commission from Turgot, he and Condorcet and the Abbe Bossut
made experiments that helped to de- termine the laws of fluid resistance
to surface-moving bodies. Late in life he studied the motion of
vibrating chords, and issued ( 1779 ) Elements de musique theorique et
pratique, following and modifying the system of Rameau; this book won
the praise of the famous musicologist Charles Bur- ney. All in all,
d’Alembert had one of the keenest minds of the century.</p>
<p>When Maupertuis resigned as president of the Berlin Academy Frederick
the Great offered the post to d’Alembert. The
mathematician-physicist-as- tronomer-encyclopedist was poor, but he
courteously refused; he cherished his freedom, his friends, and Paris.
Frederick respected his motives, and, with the permission of Louis XV,
sent him a modest pension of twelve hundred livres. In 1762 Catherine
the Great invited him to Russia and the Academy of St. Petersburg; he
declined, for he was now in love. Perhaps informed of this, Catherine
persisted, bade him come “avec tous vos amis” with all his friends, and
offered him a salary of 100,000 francs a year. She took his refusals
graciously, and continued to correspond with him, dis- cussing with him
her mode and problems of government. In 1763 Frederick urged him at
least to visit Potsdam; d’Alembert went, and dined with the King for two
months. He again declined the presidency of the Berlin Academy; instead
he induced Frederick to raise the salary of Euler, who had a large
family. 16 We hope to meet d’Alembert again.</p>
<p>The amazing Bernoullis made some incidental contributions to
mechanics. Johann I formulated (1717) the principle of virtual
velocities: “In all equilib - rium of forces whatsoever, in whatever
manner they are applied, and in what- ever directions they act upon one
another, whether directly or indirectly, the sum of the positive
energies will be equal to the sum of the negative energies taken
positively.” Johann and his son Daniel (1735) proclaimed that the sum of
vis viva (living force) in the world is always constant; this principle
was re- formulated in the nineteenth century as the conservation of
energy. Daniel applied the conception to good effect in his
Hydrodynamics (1738), a modern classic in an especially difficult field.
In that volume he founded the kinetic theory of gases: a gas is composed
of tiny particles moving about with great</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE J 1 7</p>
<p>rapidity, and exerting pressure upon the container by their repeated
impacts; heat increases the velocity of the particles and therefore the
pressure of the gas; and the lessening of the volume (as Boyle had
shown) proportionately increases the pressure.</p>
<p>In the physics of heat the great name for the eighteenth century is
Joseph Black. Born in Bordeaux to a Scot born in Belfast, he studied
chemistry in the University of Glasgow, and at the age of twenty-six
(1754) made experiments in what we would now call oxidation or
corrosion; these indicated the action of a gas distinct from common air;
he detected this in the balance, and called it “fixed air” (now called
carbon dioxide); Black had come close to the discov - ery of oxygen. In
1756, as lecturer in chemistry, anatomy, and medicine at the university,
he began observations t hat led him to his theory of “latent heat”: when
a substance is in process of changing from a solid to a liquid state, or
from a liquid to a gas, the changing substance absorbs from the
atmosphere an amount of heat not detectable as a change of temperature;
and this latent heat is given back to the atmosphere when a gas changes
into a liquid or a liquid into a solid. James Watt applied this theory
in his improvement of the steam engine. Black, like nearly all
predecessors of Priestley, thought of heat as a material substance
(“caloric”) added to or subtracted from matter rising or fall - ing in
warmth; not until 1798 did Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, show that
heat is not a substance but a mode of motion, now conceived as an
accele- rated motion of a body’s constituent parts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Johan Carl Wilcke of Stockholm, independently of Black,
arrived at a similar theory of latent heat (1772). In a series of
experiments reported in 1777 the Swedish scientist introduced the term
“radiant heat”— the invisible heat given off by hot materials; he
distinguished it from light, described its lines of motion and its
reflection and concentration by mirrors, and prepared for the later
correlation of both heat and light as kindred forms of radiation.
Wilcke, Black, Lavoisier, Laplace, and other investigators determined
the ap- proximate value of “absolute zero” (the lowest temperature
possible in princi - ple). The British adopted as the unit of heat that
quantity which raises the tem- perature of a pound of water one degree
Fahrenheit; the French, and the Con- tinent in general, preferred to use
that quantity of heat which raises the tem- perature of a kilogram of
water one degree centigrade.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century made little progress in the theory of light,
because nearly all physicists accepted Newton’s “corpuscular
hypothesis”— that light is the emission of particles from the object to
the eye. Euler led a minority that defended a wave theory. Following
Huygens, he assumed that the “empty” space between the heavenly bodies,
and between other visible objects, is filled with “ether,” a material
too fine to be perceived by our senses or our instruments, but strongly
suggested by the phenomena of gravity, magnetism, and electricity.
Light, i n Euler’s view, is an undulation in the ether, just as sound is
an undula - tion in the air. He distinguished colors as due to different
periods of vibration in light waves, and anticipated the current
assignment of blue light to the short- est period of vibration, and red
light to the longest. — Pierre Bouguer verified</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>by experiment what Kepler had worked out theoretically, that the
intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the distance from
its source. Johann Lam- bert devised ways of measuring the intensity of
light, and reported that the brightness of the sun is 277,000 times that
of the moon; this, like our childhood theology, we must take on
faith.</p>
<p>2 . Electricity</p>
<p>The most brilliant advances in eighteenth-century physics were in the
field of electricity. Frictional electricity had long been known; Thales
of Miletus (600 b.c.) was familiar with the power of amber, jet, and a
few other substances, when rubbed, to attract light objects like
feathers or straw. William Gilbert, physician to Queen Elizabeth, called
this attrac- tive power “electron” (from the Greek elektron, amber) and,
in Latin, vis elecmca. The next step was to find a way to conduct and
use this static electricity. Guericke and Hauksbee had sought such means
in the seven- teenth century; it remained for Stephen Gray to make the
decisive discov- ery (1729).</p>
<p>Gray was an old irascible pensioner in a London almshouse. Having</p>
<p>“electrified,” by rubbing, a glass tube corked at both ends, he found
that the corks, as well as the tube, would attract a feather. He
inserted one end of a wooden rod into one of the corks, and the other
end into an ivory ball; when he rubbed the tube the ball, as well as the
tube and the corks, attracted a feather; the vis electrica had been
conducted along the rod. Using packthread or strong twine instead of the
rod, he was able to con- duct the electricity through a distance of 765
feet. When he used hair, silk, resin, or glass as a connection there was
no conduction; in this way Gray remarked the difference between
conductors and non-conductors, and he discovered that non-conductors
could be used for the preservation or stor- age of electric charges.
When he suspended 666 feet of conductive pack- thread from a long
succession of inclined poles, and sent the electric “vir - tue” (as he
called it) through that distance, he in effect anticipated the
telegraph.</p>
<p>Fra nce took up the quest. Jean Desaguliers, continuing (173 6)
Gray’s experiments, divided substances into conductors and
non-conductors (which he called “electrics per se”), and found that the
latter could be changed into conductors by being moistened with water.
Charles Du Fay carried on researches which he reported to the Academie
des Sciences in 1733-37; and in a modest letter to the Royal Society of
London (1734) he formulated his most important conclusion:</p>
<p>Chance has thrown in my way another Principle: . . . that there
are</p>
<p>two distinct electricities, very different from each other; one of
which</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5 J 9</p>
<p>I call vitreous electricity, and the other resinous electricity. The
first is that of glass, rock crystal, precious stones, hair of animals,
wool, and many other bodies. The second is that of amber, copal,
gum-lack, silk, thread, paper, and a vast number of other substances.
The character of these two electricities is that a body of the vitreous
electricity … re- pels all such as are of the same electricity, and, on
the contrary, attracts all those of the resinous electricity. 17</p>
<p>So, Du Fay found, two bodies electrified by contact with the same
elec- trified body repel each other; every schoolboy can recall his
astonishment at seeing two pith balls, suspended by non-conductors from
the same point and lying in contact with each other, suddenly spring
apart when touched by the same electrified glass rod. Later experiments
showed that “vitreous” bodies may develop “resinous” electricity, and
“resinous” bodies may develop “vitreous” electricity. Franklin therefore
replaced Du Fay’s terms with positive and negative. Du Fay amused his
contemporaries by suspending a man by non-conductive cords, charging him
with electricity by contact with an electrified body, and then drawing
sparks from his body, with no harm to the hanging man.*</p>
<p>The scene moved to Germany. About 1742 Georg Bose in some part
anticipated Franklin by suggesting that the aurora borealis is of
electrical origin. In 1 744 Christian Ludolff, at the Berlin Academy,
showed that an electric spark can ignite an inflammable fluid. Bose
exploded gunpowder in this way, inaugurating the use of electricity in
blasting, firing cannon, and a hundred other ways. In the same year
Gottlieb Kratzenstein began the employment of electricity in dealing
with diseases. In October, 1745, E. G. von Kleist, a Pomeranian
clergyman, discovered that an electrical charge could be stored in a
glass tube by filling this with a liquid into which he had inserted a
nail connected with a machine producing frictional elec- tricity; when
the connection was severed, the liquid retained its charge for several
hours. A few months later Pieter van Musschenbroek, professor at Leiden,
without any knowledge of Kleist’s experiments, made the same discovery,
and received from a charged but disconnected bowl a shock that for a
moment seemed mortal; he took two days to recover. Further ex- periments
at Leiden showed that a heavier charge could be stored in an empty
bottle if its lower interior and exterior surfaces had been coated</p>
<ul>
<li>Now began a century of electrical tricks. Georg Bose, a professor in
the University of Leipzig, invited several friends to dinner; secretly
he insulated the table, but connected various objects on it with an
electricity-producing machine hidden in the next room; when the guests
were about to eat he signaled an aide to start the machine; sparks flew
out from dishes, viands, flowers. He introduced to the company an
attractive young woman whose shoes insulated her from the floor, but
whose person had been charged with electricity; he invited the guests to
kiss her; the gallants received shocks which, reported the professor,
nearly “knocked their teeth out .” 18</li>

<p>with tinfoil. Daniel Gralath conceived the idea of binding several
such “Leiden jars” together, and found that their discharge would kill
small animals.</p>
<p>In 1746 Louis Guillaume in Paris and in 1747 William Watson in Lon-
don demonstrated what Watson was the first to call a “circuit.” Watson
laid a wire some twelve hundred feet long across Westminster Bridge; on
one side of the Thames a man held one end of the wire and touched the
water; on the other side a second man held the wire and a Leiden jar;
when a third man touched the jar with one hand and with the other
grasped a wire that extended into the river, the “circuit” was closed,
and all three men re - ceived a shock. In 1 747 Grummert of Dresden
noted that sparks could be made for some distance through a partial
vacuum, giving out considerable</p>
<p>light-</p>
<p>This year 1747 brings us to Benjamin Franklin, who then began the
elec- trical experiments that made his name and honor oscillate between
science and politics. Here was one of the great minds and hearts of
history, whose creative curiosity ranged from such proposals as
daylight-saving time, rock- ing chairs and bifocal glasses to lightning
rods and the one-fluid theory of electricity. A leading scientist of our
century, Sir Joseph Thomson, con- fessed that he was “struc k by the
similarity between some of the views which we are led to take by the
results of the most recent researches with those enunciated by Franklin
in the very infancy of the subject.” 19</p>
<p>One of Franklin’s first discoveries was the effect of pointed bodies
in “drawing off and throwing off the electrical fire.” 20 He found that
“a long, slender shaft- bodkin” could attract a flow of electricity from
an electrified ball six or eight inches distant, whereas a blunt body
had to be brought within an inch of the ball to produce the same effect.
Franklin spoke of electricity as fire, but this fire, he thought, was
the result of a disturbance between the equilibrium of the “positive”
and “negative” fiery fluids which he conceived electricity to be. All
bodies, in his view, contained such elec- trical fluid: a “plus” body,
containing more than its normal amount, is positively electrified, and
tends to discharge its surplus into a body con- taining a normal amount
or less; a “minus” body, containing less than its normal amount, is
negatively electrified, and will draw electricity from a body containing
a normal amount or more. On this basis Franklin devel- oped a battery
composed of eleven large glass plates covered with sheets of lead, which
were electrified to a high excess; when this structure was brought into
contact with bodies less heavily charged, it released part of its charge
with a force that (said Franklin) “knew no bounds,” sometimes exceeding
“the greatest known effects of common lightning.” 21</p>
<p>Several investigators — Wall, Newton, Hauksbee, Gray, and others —
had noted the resemblance between electric sparks and lightning;
Franklin</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5 21</p>
<p>proved their identity. In 1750 he sent to the Royal Society of London
a letter reading in part:</p>
<p>May not the knowledge of this power of points be of use to mankind in
preserving houses, churches, ships, etc., from the stroke of lightning,
by directing us to fix on the highest parts of the edifices upright rods
of iron made sharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent rusting, and from
the foot of these rods a wire drawn down the outside of the building
into the grounds, or round one of the shrouds of a ship down her side
till it reaches the water? Would not these pointed rods probably draw
the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came nigh enough
to</p>
<p>strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible mis-
chief? 22</p>
<p>He went on to describe an experiment by which this could be tested.
The Royal Society rejected the proposal as visionary, and refused to
publish Franklin’s letter. Two French scientists, de Lor and d’Alibard,
put Frank - lin’s theory to trial by erecting in a garden at Marly
(1752) a pointed iron rod fifty feet high; they instructed a guard to
touch the rod with an in- sulated brass wire if, in their absence,
thunder clouds should pass overhead. The clouds came, the guard touched
the rod not only with wire but also with his hand; sparks flew and
crackled, and the guard was severely shocked. De Lor and d’Alibard
confirmed the guard’s report by further tests, and informed the Academie
des Sciences, “Franklin’s idea is n o longer a conjecture but a
reality.”</p>
<p>Franklin himself was not satisfied; he wished to make the identity of
lightning and electricity evident by “extracting” lightning with
something sent up into the storm cloud itself. In June, 1752, as a
thunderstorm began, he sent up, on strong twine, a kite made of silk (as
better fitted than paper to bear wind and moisture without tearing) ; a
sharply pointed wire pro- jected some twelve inches from the top of the
kite; and at the observer’s end of the twine a key was fastened with a
silk ribbon. In sending to Eng- land (October 19) directions for
repeating the experiment, Franklin in- dicated the results:</p>
<p>When the rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the elec-
tric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the
key</p>
<p>at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial 〔or
Leiden jarj may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained spirits
may be kindled, and all other electric experiments 〔may be〕
performed</p>
<p>which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or
tube;</p>
<p>and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of
light- ning completely demonstrated. 23</p>
<p>5^2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>The experiment was repeated in France (1753) with a larger kite and a
780-foot cord twisted around an iron wire, ending at the observer in a
metal tube which, in action, emitted sparks eight inches long. Professor
G. W. Richman of St. Petersburg, making a similar test, was killed by
the shock (1753). Franklin’s publications, sent to England in 1751 -54,
won him election to the repentant Royal Society, and its Copley Medal.
Their translation into French evoked a complimentary letter from Louis
XV, and enthusiastic praise from Diderot, who called them models of
scientific reporting. Those translations prepared for the favorable
reception given to Franklin when he came to France to seek aid for the
American colonies in their revolution. When, with the help of France,
that revolution succeeded, d’Alembert (or Turgot) summed up Franklin’s
achievement in a compact</p>
<p>Eripuit coelo fulmen sceptrumque tyrannis</p>
<p>—“he snatched the lightning from the sky, and the scepter from the
tyrants.”</p>
<p>All Europe was alive, after 1750, with electrical theories and
experiments. John Canton (1753) and the versatile Wilcke (1757) led the
way in studying electrostatic induction, by which an uncharged conductor
becomes electrified when placed near a charged body. Wilcke proved that
most substances can be charged with positive (or negative) electricity
if rubbed with a body less (or more) highly charged than themselves.
Working with Wilcke at Berlin, Aepi- nus (Franz Ulrich Hoch) showed that
two metal plates separated only by a layer of air acted like a Leiden
jar. Joseph Priestley sought to measure the strength of an electric
charge, and the maximum width across which the spark of a given charge
would pass. He reported that when a spark crossed a gap even as wide as
two inches between two metal rods in a vacuum, a “thin blue or purple
light” appeared in the gap. But Priestley’s most brilliant contribution
to electrical theory was the suggestion that the laws of electricity
might be like those of gravitation, and that the force exerted upon each
other by separate electric charges would vary inversely as the square of
the distance between their source. Henry Cavendish (who, like Priestley,
is remembered chiefly for his work in chemistry) tested Priestley’s
suggestion in a series of patient experi - ments; he arrived at a slight
but important modification, which James Clerk Maxwell further refined in
1878; as such the law is received today. Charles Augustin de Coulomb,
after valuable work on the tension of beams and the re- sistance of
metals to torsion, submitted to the Academie des Sciences reports of
experiments (1785-89) which applied the torsion balance (a needle
supported on a fine fiber) to the measurement of magnetic influences and
electrical charges; in both cases he substantially verified the law of
inverse squares.</p>
<p>Two Italians, like Coulomb, left their names in the terminology of
elec- tricity. Luigi Galvani, professor of anatomy at Bologna,
discovered not</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE 523</p>
<p>only that muscular contractions could be produced in dead animals by
di- rect electrical contact (this had long been known), but that such
contrac- tions occurred when the leg of a dead frog, connected with the
earth, was brought near a machine that was discharging an electric
spark. Similar con- vulsions were produced in frogs’ legs— likewise
grounded, and tied to long iron wires — when lightning flashed into the
room. Galvani was surprised to find that he could make a frog’s leg
contract without any use or presence of electrical apparatus, merely by
bringing the nerve and muscle of the leg into contact with two different
metals. He concluded that there was a natural electricity in the animal
organism.</p>
<p>Alessandro Volta, professor of physics at Pavia, repeated these
experi- ments, and at first agreed with his countryman’s theory of
animal elec - tricity. But his further researches modified his views.
Repeating an experi- ence reported by J. G. Sulzer about 1750, Volta
found that if he placed a piece of tin on the tip of his tongue, and a
piece of silver on the back of his tongue, he felt a strong sour taste
whenever he connected the two metals with a wire. By connecting his
forehead and his palate with these two different metals he obtained a
sensation of light. In 1792 he announced his conclusion that the metals
themselves, and not the animal tissue, pro- duced the electricity merely
by their interaction with each other and their contact with a moist
substance, preferably a solution of salt. Further ex- periments proved
that the contact of two different metals caused them to be electrically
charged — one positively, the other negatively — without the mediation
of any moist substance, animal or not; but such direct contact produced
only an interchange of charges, not an outflow of current. To produce a
current Volta made a “Voltaic pile” by superimposing several layers,
each composed of two connected plates of different metal and one plate
of moist paper or wood. So was formed, in the last year of the eight-
eenth century, the first electrical-current battery. The way was opened
for electricity to remake the face and night of the world.</p>

<p>“Physics and mathematics,” wrote Edward Gibbon in 1761, “are now on
the throne. They see their sisters prostrate before them, chained to
their car, or at most adorning their triumph. Perhaps their own fall is
not far distant.” 24 It was an unlucky prediction; physics is now the
queen of the sciences, mathematics is her helpmate, and no man can tell
what will come of their union.</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Nevertheless, amid all the victories of seventeenth-century
mathematics, physics, and astronomy, a young science had emerged from
the swaddling clothes of alchemy. A tragic error almost stifled it in
its infancy. Following a theory proposed by Johann Becher in 1669, Georg
Stahl, professor of medicine and chemistry at Halle, interpreted
combustion as the liberation of “phlogiston” from the burning material
into the air. ( Phlogiston was Greek for inflammable ; phlox was Greek
for flame, and is our word for a plant whose flowers are sometimes
flaming red.) By 1750 most chemists in Western Europe accepted this
theory of heat or fire as a substance de- tached from burning matter.
But no one could explain why, if this was so, metals weighed more after
burning than before.</p>
<p>Our current explanation of combustion was prepared by the work of
Hales, Black, and Scheele on the chemistry of the air. Stephen Hales
paved the way by devising a “pneumatic trough,” or air receptacle, into
which gases could be collected in a closed vessel over water. He pointed
out that gases (which he called “airs”) were contained in many solids,
and he described air as “a fine elastic fluid, with particles of a very
different nature</p>
<p>Sweden contributed lavishly to eighteenth-century chemistry. Torbern
Olof Bergman, whom we shall meet again as a pioneer in physical geog-
raphy, was primarily a chemist, famous and loved as a professor of that
science in the University of Uppsala. He was the first to obtain nickel
in a pure state and the first to show the importance of carbon in
determining the physical properties of carbon-iron compounds. In his
relatively short life of forty-nine years he studied, with over thirty
thousand experiments, the chemical affinities of fifty-nine substances,
and reported his findings in Elective Attractions (1775). He died before
completing this task, but meanwhile he had passed on to Scheele his
devotion to chemical research.</p>
<p>English historians of science now gallantly concede that a
Swedish</p>
<p>chemist, Karl Wilhelm Scheele, anticipated (1772) Priestley’s
discovery (1774) of what Lavoisier (1779) was the first to call oxygen.
Scheele</p>
<p>lived most of his forty-three years in poverty. Beginning as an
apprentice to an apothecary in Goteborg, he rose no higher than to be a
pharmacist in</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5 2 5</p>
<p>the modest town of Koping. His teacher, Torbern Bergman, obtained a
small pension for him from the Stockholm Academy of Science; Scheele
spent eighty per cent of it on chemical experiments. He performed most
of these at night after the day’s work, and with the simplest laboratory
equip - ment; hence his early death. Yet he covered nearly the whole
field of the new science, and defined it with his usual simplicity: “The
object and chief business of chemistry is skillfully to separate
substances into their con- stituents, to discover their properties, and
to compound them in different ways.” 26</p>
<p>In 1775 he sent to the printer a manuscript entitled Chemical
Treatise on Air and Fire ; its publication was delayed till 1777, but
nearly all the experi- ments it described had been carried out before
1773. Scheele, while holding till his death the belief in phlogiston,
laid down the basic proposition that unpolluted atmosphere is composed
of two gases: one of these he named “fire - air” (our oxygen), as the
main support of fire; the other he called “vitiated air” (our nitrogen),
as air that has lost “fire - air.” He prepared oxygen in several ways.
In one method he mixed concentrated sulfuric acid with finely ground
manganese, heated the mixture in a retort, and collected the resultant
gas in a bladder that had been pressed nearly free of air. He found that
when the gas so produced was played over a lighted candle, this “began
to burn with a larger flame, and emit ted such a bright light that it
dazed the eyes.” 27 He concluded that “fire - air” was the gas that
supported fire. “There is little doubt but that he obtained the gas two
years before Priestley.” 28</p>
<p>This was but a fraction of Scheele’s achievement. His record as a dis
- coverer of new substances is probably unequaled. 29 He was the first
to iso- late chlorine, barium, manganese, and such new compounds as
ammonia, glycerine, and hydrofluoric, tannic, benzoic, oxalic, malic,
and tartaric acids. His discovery that chlorine would bleach cloth,
vegetables, and flowers was put to commercial uses by Berthollet in
France and James Watt in England. In further researches Scheele
discovered uric acid by analyzing stone in the bladder (1776). In 1777
he prepared sulfuretted hy- drogen, and in 1778 molybdic acid; in 1780
he proved that the acidity of sour milk is due to lactic acid; in 1781
he obtained tungstic acid from cal- cium tungstate (now known as
scheelite); in 1783 he discovered prussic (hydrocyanic) acid, without
realizing its poisonous character. He pro- duced also arsine gas (a
deadly compound of arsenic), and the arsenic pig- ment now known as
Scheele’s green. 30 He helped to make photography possible by showing
that sunlight reduces chloride of silver to silver, and that the diverse
rays that compose white light have different effects upon silver salts.
The incredibly fruitful labor of this brief life proved of endless
importance in the industrial developments of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>2 . Priestley</p>
<p>Joseph Priestley, rather than Scheele, for a long time received the
credit for the discovery of oxygen because he discovered it
independently of Scheele, and announced his discovery in 1775, two years
before Scheele’s retarded publication. We honor him nevertheless because
his researches enabled Lavoisier to give chemistry its modern form;
because he was among the pioneers in the scientific study of
electricity; and because he contrib- uted so boldly to British thought
on religion and government that a fanati- cal mob burned down his house
in Birmingham, and induced him to seek refuge in America. He touched the
history of civilization at many points, and is one of its most inspiring
characters.</p>
<p>He was born in Yorkshire in 1733, son of a Dissenter cloth-dresser.
He studied voraciously in science, philosophy, theology, and languages;
he learned Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian, Arabic, even some
Syriac and Chaldee. He set up as a Dissenting preacher in Suffolk, but
an impedi- ment in his speech lessened the appeal of his eloquence. At
twenty-five he organized a private school, whose curriculum he enlivened
with experi- ments in physics and chemistry. At twenty-eight he became
tutor in a Dissenting academy at Warrington; there he taught five
languages and yet found time for researches that won him a fellowship in
the Royal Society (1766). In that year he met Franklin in London, and
was encouraged by him to write The History and Present State of
Electricity (1767), an ad- mirable survey of the whole subject up to his
own time. In 1767 he was ap- pointed pastor of Mill Hill Chapel at
Leeds. He recalled later that “it was in consequence of living for some
time in the neighborhood of a public brewery that I was induced to make
experiments in fixed air” 31 — the brew- ery mash emitted carbonic-acid
gas. He dissolved this in water, and liked its bubbling tang; this was
the first “soda water.”</p>
<p>In 1772 he was relieved of economic worry by appointment to the post
of librarian to Lord Shelburne. In the house provided for him at Colne
he performed the experiments that won him international renown. He im-
proved upon Hales’s pneumatic trough by collecting over mercury, instead
of over water, the gases generated by diverse mixtures. So in 1772 he
iso- lated nitric oxide, nitrous oxide (“laughing gas” ), and hydrogen
chloride; in 1773 ammonia (independently of Scheele); in 1774 sulfur
dioxide; in 1776 nitrogen peroxide. On March 15, 1775, he communicated
to the Royal Society a letter announcing his discovery of oxygen. In
Volume II of his Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air
(1775) he de- scribed his method. Using a strong burning lens, he
said.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>5*7</p>
<p>I proceeded … to examine, by the help of it, what kind of air a
great</p>
<p>variety of substances would yield 〔when so heated〕, putting them
into . . . vessels . . . filled with quicksilver and kept inverted in a
basin of</p>
<p>the same. With this apparatus, … on the first of August, 1774, I
en-</p>
<p>deavored to extract air from mercurius calcinatus per se
〔mercuric</p>
<p>oxide〕; and I presently found that, by means of this lens, air was
ex- pelled from it very readily. . . . What surprised me, more than I
can</p>
<p>well express, was that a candle burned in this air with a remarkably
vig- orous flame. 32</p>
<p>Noting, like Scheele, that a mouse lived much longer in this
“dephlogisti - cated air” (as he called oxygen) than in the ordinary
atmosphere, he thought he might safely sample the new air himself.</p>
<p>My reader will not wonder that, after having ascertained the
supe-</p>
<p>rior goodness of dephlogisticated air by mice living in it, and the
other tests above mentioned, I should have the curiosity to taste it by
my- self. I have gratified that curiosity by breathing it, drawing it
through a glass siphon; and by this means I reduced a large jar full of
it to the</p>
<p>standard of common air. The feeling of it to my lungs was not
sensibly different from common air, but I fancied that my breast felt
peculiarly light for some time afterward. Who can tell but that, in
time, this pure air may become a fashionable article of luxury? Hitherto
only two</p>
<p>mice and I have had the privilege of breathing it. 33</p>
<p>He predicted some forms of this future luxury:</p>
<p>From the greater strength and vivacity of the flame of a candle
in</p>
<p>this pure air, it may be conjectured that it might be peculiarly
salutary to the lungs in certain morbid cases, when the common air would
not be sufficient to carry off the phlogistic putrid effluvium 〔carbon
di-</p>
<p>oxide〕 fast enough. But perhaps we may also infer from these experi-
ments that though pure dephlogisticated air 〔oxygen〕 might be very
useful as a medicine , it might not be so proper for us in the usual</p>
<p>healthy state of the body; for as a candle burns out faster in
dephlogis- ticated air than in common air, so we might, as may be said,
live out too fast, and the animal power be too soon exhausted, in this
pure kind of air. 34</p>
<p>Priestley’s experimental work was brilliant with fruitful hypotheses
and alert perceptions, but his theoretical interpretations were mostly
traditional. Like Stahl and Scheele, he supposed that in combustion a
substance, phlogis- ton, was emitted by the burning material; this
substance, in his view, united with one constituent of the atmosphere to
form “vitiated air,” or “phlogis -</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>ticated air” (our nitrogen); the other constituent was in his
nomenclature “dephlogisticated air,” which Lavoisier was to name oxygen.
While Lavoi - sier argued that a material in process of combustion
absorbed oxygen from the air instead of expelling phlogiston into it,
Priestley to the end of his life retained the old conception.</p>
<p>In 1774 he traveled with Lord Shelburne on the Continent, and told
him of the oxygen experiments. In 1780 Shelburne retired him with an
annuity of £ 1 50. Priestley settled in Birmingham as junior minister of
a large Dis- senting congregation known as the New Meeting Society. He
joined James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, Erasmus Darwin, Matthew Boulton, and
others in a “Lunar Society” that discussed the latest ideas in science,
tech - nology, and philosophy. He was popular with nearly all classes,
admired for his cheerful spirit, his modesty and generosity, and “the
unspotted purity of his life.” 35 But some of his neighbors questioned
his Christianity. In Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777)
he reduced every- thing, even the soul, to matter. This, he insisted,
was perfectly orthodox,</p>
<p>it being well known to the learned . . . that what the ancients meant
by an immaterial being was only a finer kind of what we should now call
matter; something like air or breath, which first supplied a name for
the soul. . . . Consequently the ancients did not exclude from</p>
<p>mind the property of extension and local pressure. It had, in their
idea, some common properties with matter, was capable of being united
with it, of acting and being acted upon by it. . . . It was therefore
seen that . . . the power of sensation or thought . . . might be
imparted</p>
<p>to the very grossest matter, . . . and that the soul and body, being
in reality the same kind of substance, must die together . 36</p>
<p>In a further publication of the same year, The Doctrine of
Philosophical Necessity Illustrated, Priestley, following Hartley and
Hume, enthusiasti- cally denied the freedom of the will. And in a
History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1782), he rejected miracles,
the Fall, the Atonement, and the Trinity; all these doctrines he
considered to be “corruptions” developed in the evolution of
Christianity; they were not to be found in the teachings of Christ or
the twelve Apostles. All that was left of Christianity in Priest- ley
was the belief in God, based on the evidences of divine design. Not
quite reconciled to mortality, he suggested that at the Last Day God
would re-create all the dead. His real hope, however, was not in a
heaven above but in a utopia that would be built on this earth by the
victory of science over superstition and ignorance. Seldom has the
eighteenth-century religion of progress been more fervently
expressed:</p>
<p>All knowledge will be subdivided and extended; and knowledge, as</p>
<p>Lord Bacon observes, being power, the human powers will in fact
be</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>529</p>
<p>increased; nature, including both its materials and its laws, will be
more at our command; men will make their situation in this world
abun-</p>
<p>dantly more easy and comfortable; they will probably prolong
their</p>
<p>existence on it, and will daily grow more happy, each in himself, and
more able (and, I believe, more disposed) to communicate happiness to
others. Thus, whatever was the beginning of this world, the end will be
glorious and paradisaical beyond what our imaginations can now con-
ceive . 37 . . . Happy are they who contribute to diffuse the pure light
of this everlasting gospel . 38</p>
<p>Part of this glorious progress, in Priestley’s vision, was to be
political, and would be based upon a simple humanitarian principle: “The
good and hap - piness of the . . . majority of the members of any state
is the great stand- ard by which everything relating to that state must
finally be deter-</p>
<p>mined”; 39 here Bentham, according to Bentham, found one source of
his utilitarian philosophy. The only just government, said Priestley, is
one that aims at the happiness of its citizens, and it is quite
consistent with Chris- tianity that an obviously unjust government
should be overthrown by the people. To St. Paul’s caution that “the
powers that be are ordained of God” Priestley replied that “for the same
reason the powers which will be w ill be ordained of God also.” 40</p>
<p>It was natural that such a rebel should sympathize with the colonies
in their protest against taxation without representation. Still more
warmly did he acclaim the French Revolution. When Burke denounced it
Priestley de- fended it; Burke, in Parliament, branded him as a heretic.
Some of Priest- ley’s friends shared his radical views. On July 14,
1791, the “Constitutional Society of Birmingham” met in the Royal Hotel
to celebrate the anni - versary of the fall of the Bastille. Priestley
did not attend. A crowd gath- ered before the hotel, listened to its
leaders’ attacks upon heretics and traitors, and stoned the hotel
windows; the banqueters fled. The crowd moved on to Priestley’s house,
and joyously burned it down, including his laboratory and instruments,
his library and manuscripts. Then for three days it ranged through
Birmingham, swearing to kill all “philosophers”; terrified citizens
scrawled on their windowpanes, “No philosophers here.” Priestley fled to
Dudley, then to London. Thence on July 19 he addressed a letter to the
people of Birmingham:</p>
<p>My Late Townsmen and Neighbors,</p>
<p>After living with you eleven years, in which you had uniform ex-</p>
<p>perience of my peaceful behavior in my attention to the quiet duties
of my profession, and those of philosophy, I was far from expecting the
injuries which I and my friends have lately received from you. . . .</p>
<p>Happily the minds of Englishmen have a horror of murder and

<p>fore you did not, I hope, think of that. . . . But what is the value
of</p>
<p>life when everything is done to make it wretched? . . .</p>
<p>You have destroyed the most truly valuable and useful apparatus</p>
<p>of philosophical instruments. … You have destroyed a library . .
.</p>
<p>which no money can repurchase except in a long course of time. But
what I feel far more, you have destroyed manuscripts which have been the
result of the laborious study of many years, and which I shall never be
able to recompose; and this has been done to one who never did, or
imagined, you any harm.</p>
<p>You are mistaken if you imagine that this conduct of yours has
any</p>
<p>tendency to serve your cause, or to prejudice ours. . . . Should
you</p>
<p>destroy myself as well as my house, library, and apparatus, ten more
persons, of equal or superior spirit and ability, would instantly spring
up. If those ten were destroyed, an hundred would appear. . . .</p>
<p>In this business we are the sheep and you the wolves. We will perse-
vere in our character, and hope you will change yours. At all events, we
return you blessings for curses, and pray that you may soon return to
that industry, and those sober manners, for which the inhabitants of
Birmingham were formerly distinguished.</p>
<p>I am, your sincere well-wisher,</p>
<p>J. Priestley . 41</p>
<p>Nevertheless he sued the city for damages, estimating his loss at
^4,500; Charles James Fox helped his suit; Birmingham awarded him
^2,502. He tried to establish a new domicile in England, but churchmen,
royalists, and his fellows in the Royal Society shunned him. 42 The
French Academie des Sciences, through its secretary, Condorcet, sent him
an offer of a home and laboratory in France. On April 8, 1794, aged
sixty-one, he emigrated to America. He made his new home in the town of
Northumberland, in Franklin’s Pennsylvania, on the banks of that lovely
Susquehanna River about which Coleridge and Southey were soon to dream.
He resumed his experiments, and discovered the composition of carbon
monoxide. He was welcomed by learned societies, and was offered the
chair in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1796 he
delivered before the Universal- ists of Philadelphia a series of disco
urses on “The Evidences of Christian - ity”; his audience included Vice
-President John Adams and many mem- bers of Congress. From those
meetings a Unitarian Society took form. Two years later Timothy
Pickering, Secretary of State under President Adams, proposed to deport
Priestley as an undesirable alien. The election of Jeffer- son (1800)
ended Priestley’s insecurity, and he was allowed four years of peace. In
1803 he wrote his last scientific paper, still defending phlogiston. He
died at Northumberland on February 6, 1804. In 1943 the Pennsylvania
legislature designated his home as a national memorial.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>While Thomas Paine took up Priestley’s campaign as a rebel Christian,
Henry Cavendish pursued the chemistry of gases. Son of a lord, nephew of
a duke, Cavendish at forty inherited one of the greatest fortunes in
Eng- land. Timid, hesitant in speech, careless of dress, he lived as a
recluse in his laboratory at Clapham Common, London, and made no
overtures to fame. His research was distinguished by meticulous
measuring and weighing of all materials before and after an experiment;
these measurements enabled Lavoisier to formulate the principle that in
chemical changes the amount of matter remains constant.</p>
<p>In 1766 Cavendish reported to the Royal Society his experiments on
“factitious air”— i.e., gas derived from solids. By dissolving zinc or
tin in acids he produced what he called “inflammable air”; he identified
this with phlogiston; we now call it hydrogen; Cavendish was the first
to recognize this as a distinct element, and to determine its specific
gravity. In 1783, fol- lowing up an experiment by Priestley, he found
that when an electric spark was passed throu gh a mixture of common air
and “inflammable air,” part of the mixture was condensed into dew; he
concluded from this electrolysis that water is composed of 2.014 volumes
of “inflammable air” to one vol - ume of Priestley’s “dephlogisticated
air”— or, as we now say, H a O; this was the first definite proof that
water is a compound, not an element. (James Watt independently suggested
the same composition of water in that same year 1783.) Again applying an
electric spark to a mixture of hy- drogen with common air, Cavendish
obtained nitric acid, and concluded that pure air is composed of oxygen
and nitrogen. (Daniel Rutherford of Edinburgh had discovered nitrogen as
a distinct element in 1772.) Caven- dish admitted a small residue which
he could not explain, but which he cal- culated to be 0.83 per cent of
the original amount. This remained a mys- tery till 1894, when Rayleigh
and Ramsay isolated this part, now called argon, as a separate element,
and found it to be by weight 0.94 per cent common air. Cavendish’s
scales were justified.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, across the Channel, a group of enthusiastic researchers
gave France the lead in the new science, and gave chemistry essentially
the form that it has today. At their source stood Guillaume Rouelle,
distinguished for his work on the chemistry of salts, but best known for
the lecture courses in which he taught chemistry to rich and poor, to
Diderot and Rousseau, and to the greatest chemist of them all.</p>
<p>Antoine Lavoisier had the advantage or handicap of being born to
wealth</p>
<p>53 *</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>(1743). His father, an advocate in the Paris Parlement, gave the boy
all the education then available, and bequeathed to him, then
twenty-three years old, 300,000 livres. Such a fortune could have
aborted a literary career, but it was a help in a science that demanded
expensive apparatus and long years of preparation. Sent to a law school,
Antoine escaped from it into mathe- matics and astronomy, and attended
Rouelle’s lectures in the auditorium of the Jardin du Roi. Nevertheless
he completed his law studies, and then ac- companied Jean Guettard in
making mineralogical tours and maps of France. In 1768 he was elected to
the Academie des Sciences, which at that time included Buffon, Quesnay,
Turgot, and Condorcet. A year later he joined the farmers general in
their unpopular business of collecting excise taxes to reimburse
themselves for their advances to the government. He paid 520,000 livres
for a third interest in one of the sixty shares of the ferme generate;
in 1770 he raised this to a full share. In 1771 he married Marie Paulze,
daughter of a rich farmer general. He spent part of his time now in
traveling through the provinces, collecting revenue, tax data, and
geological specimens. His wealth financed a great laboratory and costly
experiments,* but it brought him to the guillotine.</p>
<p>He took an active part in public affairs. Appointed (1775) regisseur
des poudres, commissioner of gunpowder, he increased the production and
im- proved the quality of that explosive, making possible its
large-scale export to the American colonies and the victories of the
French Revolutionary armies. “French gunpowder,” said Lavoisier in 1789,
“has become the best in Europe. . . . One can say with truth that to it
North America owes its liberty.” 43 He served on a variety of official
boards, national or municipal, and met with versatile intelligence
diverse problems of taxation, coinage, banking, scientific agriculture,
and public charity. As a member of the provincial assembly at Orleans
(1787) he labored to better economic and social conditions. During the
critical food shortage of 1788 he advanced his own money to several
towns for the purchase of grain. He was a public- spirited man who kept
on making money.</p>
<p>Amid all these activities he did not cease to be a scientist. His
laboratory became the most complex and extensive before the nineteenth
century: 250 instruments, thirteen thousand glass containers, thousands
of chemical preparations, and three precision balances that later helped
to determine the gram as the unit of weight in the metric system.
Weighing and measuring were h alf the secret of Lavoisier’s discoveries;
through them he changed chemistry from a qualitative theory to a
quantitative science. It was by</p>
<ul>
<li>In one of his early experiments he burned two diamonds to prove that
the sole product of their combustion was carbon dioxide. As this was
also the only product of completely burned charcoal, Lavoisier in this
way proved the chemical identity of charcoal and dia- monds as forms of
pure carbon.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>533</p>
<p>careful weighing that he proved Stahl’s phlogiston to be an
encumbering myth. That myth had assumed the existence of a mysterious
substance which in combustion left the burning material and entered the
air. On No- vember i, 1772, Lavoisier submitted to the Academie des
Sciences a note that read:</p>
<p>About eight days ago I discovered that sulfur in burning, far
from</p>
<p>losing weight, rather gains it; that is to say, that from a pound of
sul- fur may be obtained more than a pound of vitriolic acid,
allowance</p>
<p>being made for the moisture of the air. It is the same in the case
of</p>
<p>phosphorus. The gain in weight comes from the prodigious quantity of
air which is fixed 〔i.e., absorbed by the burning matter〕 during
the</p>
<p>combustion, and combines with the 〔vitriolic〕 vapors. This
discovery, which I have established by experiments that I consider
decisive, has made me believe that what is observed in the combustion of
sulfur and phosphorus may equally well take place in the case of all
those bodies which gain weight on combustion or calcination. 44</p>
<p>Instead of the burning material giving something to the air, it took
some- thing from the air. What was this something?</p>
<p>In the fall of 1774 Lavoisier published an account of further
experiments. He put a weighed quantity of tin into a weighed flask large
enough to con- tain considerable air; he sealed the flask, and heated
the whole till the tin had been well oxidized. Having allowed the system
to cool, he found that its weight remained unchanged. But when he broke
the seal air rushed into the flask, indicating that a partial vacuum had
been created in the flask. How? Lavoisier saw no other explanation
except that the burning tin had absorbed into itself a part of the air.
What was this something?</p>
<p>In October, 1774, Lavoisier met Priestley in Paris. Priestley told
him of the experiments he had made in August, which Priestley still
interpreted as showing Sn escape of phlogiston from the burned substance
into the air. On April 26, 1775, Lavoisier read to the Academie a memoir
reporting the experiments that had led him to view combustion as the
absorption, by a burning substance, of a mysterious element from the
air, which he pro- visionally called air eminemment pur. Like Priestley,
he had discovered oxygen; unlike Priestley, he had overthrown the
phlogiston myth. Not till 1779 did he coin, for the combustible element
in the air, the name oxygene, from Greek words meaning “acid -
generator,” for Lavoisier mistakenly be - lieved that oxygen was an
indispensable constituent of all acids.</p>
<p>Like Priestley, Lavoisier observed that the kind of air absorbed by
metals in combustion is also the kind that best supports animal life. On
May 3, 1777, he presented to the Academie a paper “On the Respi ration
of Ani- mals.” “Five sixths of the air we breathe,” he reported, “is
incapable of sup -</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>porting the respiration of animals, or ignition and combustion; . . .
one fifth only of the volume of atmospheric air is respirable.” He added
that “an</p>
<p>The multiplication of experiments, the growth of chemical knowledge,
and the abandonment of the phlogiston theory required a new formulation,
and a new nomenclature, for the burgeoning science. The Academie des
Sciences appointed Lavoisier, Guyton de Morveau, Fourcroy, and Ber-
thollet to attempt this task. In 1787 they published Methode d’une
nomencla- ture chimique. Old-fashioned names like powder of algaroth,
butter of arsenic, and flowers of zinc were discarded; dephlogisticated
air became oxygen; phlogistic ate d air became azote, then nitrogen;
inflammable gas be- came hydrogen; fixed air became carbon acid gas;
calcination became oxi- dation, compounds were named from their
components. A table of “simple substances” listed thirty -two elements
known to Lavoisier; chemists now list ninety-eight. Most of the terms
adopted in the Methode are standard in chemical terminology today.
Lavoisier presented the new nomenclature, and summed up the new science,
in his Traite elementaire de ch’vmie; this appeared in 1789, and marked
another revolution — the end of Stahl’s phlo - giston and Aristotle’s
elements.</p>
<p>Lavoisier himself was a victim of the French Revolution. He fiad
shared in the efforts to avoid it, and in the evils that brought it on.
In the decade that prepared it he served zealously on commissions to
study and correct abuses in prisons and hospitals. To Comptroller
General Laurent de Ville- deuil he presented (1787) a memoir listing
nine factors in the exploitation of the peasantry. His words were
especially honorable coming from a mil- lionaire owner of land:</p>
<p>Let us be bold enough to say that . . . until the reign of Louis
XVI</p>
<p>the people counted for nothing in France; it was only the power, the
authority, and the wealth of the state that were considered; the happi-
ness of the people, the liberty and well-being of the individual, were
words that never fell upon the ears of our former rulers, who were
not</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>535</p>
<p>aware that the real object of government must be to increase the sum
total of enjoyment, happiness, and welfare of all its subjects. . . .
The unfortunate farmer groans in his cottage, unrepresented and unde-
fended, his interests cared for by none of the great departments of the
national administration. 45</p>
<p>Lavoisier was chosen to represent the Third Estate at the provincial
as- sembly that met at Orleans in 1787. There he offered a measure for
abolish- ing the corvee and for maintaining the roads not by the forced
labor of the peasantry but by taxes levied on all classes; the nobility
and the clergy de- feated this proposal. He recommended a system of
social security by which all Frenchmen who so wished would contribute to
support their old age; this too was defeated. In a memoir addressed to
the government in 1785 he laid down the principle that the coming
States-General should have full legislative power, the king to be merely
its executive agent; that it should be convoked regularly; that taxation
should be universal, and the press free: 46 Lavoisier was unquestionably
one of the most enlightened members of the French bourgeoisie, and
probably his proposals expressed part of its political strategy.</p>
<p>He was also one of the leading members of the ferine generate, which
was the object of almost universal resentment. From 1768 to 1786 his
profits as a farmer general had averaged 66,667 livres per year, an
annual rate of 8.28 per cent; he may have been right in considering this
a reasonable return for the labor and risks involved. It was at his
suggestion that chief minister Calonne, in 1783-87, built a wall around
Paris to check the smugglers who were evading tolls; the wall and the
new customshouses and barriers cost thirty million livres, and evoked
widespread condemnation; the Due de Nivernois proclaimed that the
originator of the scheme should be hanged.</p>
<p>Lavoisier supported the Revolution in 1789, when it was still under
con- trol by the middle classes. A year later he felt that it was moving
toward ex- cess, violence, and war, and he pleaded for restraint. In
November some employees of the ferine generate published a pamphlet
accusing the ferine of embezzling their pension fund. “Tremble,” they
wrote, “you who have sucked the blood of the unfortunate.” 47 In 1791
Marat began a personal campaign against Lavoisier. The “Friend of the
People” had published in 1780 Recherches physiques sur le feu, in which
he claimed to have made visible the secret element in fire; Lavoisier
had refused to take the claim seriously; Marat had not forgotten. In his
periodical, Ami du penple, January 27, 1791, Marat denounced the
chemist-financier as a charlatan with a fat income, a man “whose only
claim to public recognition is that he put Paris in prison by cutting
off the fresh air with a wall that cost the poor 3 3 mil- lion livres. .

<p>post.” 48 On March 20, 1791, the Constituent Assembly abolished the
forme generate.</p>
<p>Next to be attacked was the Academie des Sciences, for all
institutions surviving from the Old Regime were suspected of
counterrevolutionary sympathies. Lavoisier defended the Academie, and
became the chief target. On August 8, 1793, the Academie was ordered to
disband. At its last meet- ing the roster was signed by, among others,
Lagrange, Lavoisier, Lalande, Lamarck, Berthollet, and Monge. Each now
went his own way, hoping that the guillotine would not find him.</p>
<p>In the same month Lavoisier, inspired by the ideas of Condorcet, sub-
mitted to the Convention a plan for a national system of schools.
Primary education was to be free for both sexes “as a duty that society
owes to the child.” Secondary education, also open to both sexes, was to
be expanded by the establishment of technical colleges throughout
France. A month later his rooms were ransacked by governmental agents;
among the letters found there, from Lavoisier’s friends, were some that
condemned the Rev - olution and spoke hopefully of foreign armies that
would soon overthrow it; other letters showed Lavoisier and his wife
planning to escape to Scot- land. 49 On November 24, 1793, thirty-two
former farmers general, includ- ing Lavoisier, were arrested. His wife
moved every influence to effect his release; she failed, but was allowed
to visit him. In prison he continued to work on his exposition of the
new chemistry. The financiers were accused of having charged excessive
interest, of having adulterated tobacco with water, and of absorbing 1
30 million livres in illegal profits. On May 5, 1794, they were summoned
before the Revolutionary Tribunal. Eight were ac- quitted; twenty-four,
including Lavoisier, were condemned to death. When the presiding judge
was asked to commute the sentence on the ground that Lavoisier and some
others were savants of value to the state, he was re- ported to have
answered, “The Republic has no need of savants”; but there is no
convincing evidence for this tale. 50 Lavoisier was guillotined on the
very day of the sentence, May 8, 1794, on what is now the Place de la
Concorde. Lagrange is said to have commented, “It took only a moment to
cut off his head, and a hundred years may not give us another like it.”
51</p>
<p>All the property of Lavoisier and his widow was confiscated to help
re- pay the Republic for the 1 30,000,000 livres allegedly owed by the
forme generate to the state. Mme. Lavoisier, penniless, was supported by
an old servant of the family. In 1795 the French government repudiated
the con- demnation of Lavoisier; her property was restored to Mme.
Lavoisier, who survived till 1836. In October, 1 795, the Lycee des Arts
held a funeral serv- ice in Lavoisier’s memory, with Lagrange delivering
the eulogy. A bust was unveiled bearing the inscription “Victim of
tyranny, respected fr iend of the arts, he continues to live; through
his genius he still serves humanity.” 52</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>

<p>V. ASTRONOMY</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Instrumental Prelude</li>
</ol>
<p>How far did the findings of mathematics, physics, and chemistry
il-</p>
<p>luminate the sky? Of all the audacities of science the most daring is
the at- tempt to fling its measuring rods around the stars, to subject
those scintillat- ing beauties to nocturnal spying, to analyze their
constituents across a bil- lion miles, and to confine their motions to
man-made logic and laws. Mind and the heavens are the poles of our
wonder and study, and the greatest wonder is mind legislating for the
firmament.</p>
<p>The farseeing instruments had been invented, the major discoveries
had been made; the eighteenth century undertook to improve the
instruments (Graham, Hadley, Dollond), extend the discoveries (Bradley
and Her- schel), apply the latest mathematics to the stars (d’Alembert
and Clairaut), and organize the results in a new system of cosmic
dynamics (Laplace) .</p>
<p>The telescope was bettered and enlarged. “Equatorial telescopes” were
made which turned on two axes — one parallel, the other perpendicular,
to the plane of the axis of the earth; this choice of axes enabled the
observer to keep a celes- tial object in view long enough for detailed
study and micrometric measure- ment. Newton had been discouraged from
use of the refracting telescope by the belief that light, in being
refracted by lenses, must necessarily be broken up into colors, so
confusing observation; he gave up the problem of making a color-free
refraction, and turned to the reflecting telescope. In 1733 Chester Moor
Hall, a “gentleman amateur,” so lved the problem by combining lenses of
different refractive media, neutralizing the diversity of color. He did
not publish his discovery, and John Dollond had to work out
independently the principles and construction of the achromatic
telescope, which he announced in the Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London in 1758.</p>
<p>In 1725 George Graham, a Quaker watchmaker, made for Edmund Halley at
Greenwich Observatory a mural quadrant — a mechanical quarter-circle
graduated into degrees and minutes, and fixed on a wall so as to catch
the transit of a star across the meridian. For Halley, James Bradley,
and Pierre Lemonnier, Graham made transit instruments combining
telescope, axis, clock, and chrono- graph, to mark such transits with
greater accuracy than before. In 1730 Thomas Godfrey, a member of
Franklin’s intellectual circle in Philadelphia, described to his friends
an instrument for measuring angles and altitudes by means of dou- ble
reflection through opposed mirrors seen in a telescope; but he did not
pub- lish it till 1734. In 1730 John Hadley built a similar instrument,
an octant — a graduated arc of an eighth of a circle; in 1757 this was
enlarged to a sixth. By enabling a navigator to see at once, in the
reflecting telescope, both the horizon and the sun (or a star), Hadley’s
“sextant” allowed a more precise measure -</p>
<p>53^ THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>ment of the angle separating the objects. This, combined with
Harrison’s ma - rine chronometer, made navigation an almost exact
science.</p>
<p>To determine the position of a ship at sea the navigator had to
determine the longitude and latitude. To find the longitude he had to
ascertain his time at the place and moment by astronomical observation,
and to compare this local time with a clock set to keep standard
(Greenwich) time wher- ever the clock might be. The problem was to
construct a chronometer that would not be affected by changes of
temperature or the motions of the ship. In 1714 the British government
offered twenty thousand pounds for a method of finding longitude within
half a degree. John Harrison, a York- shire clockmaker, submitted to
George Graham (1728) plans for a marine chronometer; Graham advanced the
money to construct it; completed in 1735, it used two massive and
opposed balances instead of a pendulum; four balance springs, moving
contrary to one another, compensated for the mo- tions of the vessel;
and a manifold of brass and steel rods, expanding with heat and
contracting with cold, and connected with the springs, neutralized the
variations in temperature. The Board of Longitude sent Harrison with his
chronometer on a test voyage to Lisbon. The results encouraged the Board
to provide funds for a second, third, and fourth improvement. This
fourth chronometer, only five inches wide, was tried on a voyage to the
West Indies (1759); on that trip the clock lost no more than five
seconds additional to its normal and precalculated loss (when stationary
on land) of eighty seconds per thirty days. After some disputes Harrison
received the full award of twenty thousand pounds. With this and other
marine in- struments, the British navy was now (at the height of the
Seven Years’ War, 1756-63) equipped to rule the waves.</p>
<p>2 . Astronomic Theory</p>
<p>The British and French competed ardently in studying astronomy; this
was no remote or “pure” science for them; it entered into the struggle
for mastery of the seas, and therefore of the whole colonial and
commercial world. Germany and Russia through Euler, Italy through
Boscovich, con- tributed to the contest without sharing in the
spoils.</p>
<p>Euler, Clairaut, and d’Alembert aided navigation by their studies of
the moon, tabulating its changes of place and phase in relation to the
sun and the earth, and its effects upon tides. From Euler’s records
Johann Tobias Mayer, at the University of Gottingen, drew up lunar
tables which won a gift from the British Board of Longitude. In 1738 the
Paris Academie des Sciences offered a prize for a theory of tides. Four
authors received awards: Daniel Bernoulli,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>Euler, Colin Maclaurin, and A. Cavallieri. All but the last based
their explana- tions upon Newton’s, adding the rotation of the earth to
the attraction of the sun and the moon as a factor in determining tides.
The Academic on several occasions invited essays on the perturbations of
the planets — their real or appar- ent deviations f rom elliptical
orbits. Clairaut’s essay won the prize in 1747, Euler’s in 1756.</p>
<p>Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich honored his Jesuit order by illuminating
discoveries in astronomy and physics. Born in Ragusa, he entered the no-
vitiate at Rome at fourteen, astonished his teachers at the Collegium
Ro- manum by his precocity in science, and was appointed to the chair of
mathematics there at twenty-nine. From that time onward he issued sixty-
six publications. He shared in determining the general orbit of comets,
and gave the first geometric solution for finding the orbit and equator
of a planet. In his treatise De materiae divisibilitate (1748) he
expounded his view of matter as composed of points, or fields, of force,
each a center al- ternately of repulsion and attraction — a theory
recalling Leibniz’ monads and prefiguring the atomic hypotheses of our
time. The versatile Jesuit organized practical enterprises — surveying
and mapping the Papal States, damming the lakes that threatened to
submerge Lucca, making plans to drain the Pontine Marshes, and helping
to design the Brera Observatory at Milan. At his urging, in 1757, Pope
Benedict XIV abrogated the decree of the Index Expurgatorius against the
Copernican system. He was given membership in the Paris Academie des
Sciences and the London Royal Society. In 1761-62 he was received with
honors in France, England, Po- land, and Turkey. In 1772 he accepted
appointment by Louis XV as di- rector of optics in the French navy. He
returned to Italy in 1783, and died at Milan in 1787, at the age of
seventy-six. He left behind him several vol- umes of poetry.</p>
<p>The most brilliant luminary among British astronomers in the first
half of the eighteenth century was James Bradley. His uncle, James
Pound, a rector at Wanstead in Essex, was an amateur astronomer, with an
observa- tory of his own; there the boy learned that there was a science
as well as an aesthetic of the stars. After taking his M.A. at Oxford,
Bradley hurried back to Wanstead, made original observations, reported
them to the Royal Society, and was elected to its membership at the age
of twenty-six (1718). Three years later he became Savilian professor of
astronomy at Oxford. When the great Halley died, in 1742, Bradley was
appointed to succeed him at Greenwich as astronomer royal. In that post
he remained till his death (1762).</p>
<p>His first major enterprise was to determine the annual parallax of a
star — i.e., the difference in its apparent direction as seen ( 1 ) from
a point on the surface of the earth, and ( 2 ) from an imaginary point
at the center of the sun.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>If, as Copernicus had supposed, the earth revolved in orbit around
the sun, such a difference should exist; none had been demonstrated; if
it could be proved it would corroborate Copernicus. The omniventurous
Robert Hooke had tried (1669) to show such a parallax in the case of the
star gamma Draconis; he had failed. Samuel Molyneux, a moneyed amateur,
resumed the attempt in 1725 at Kew; Bradley joined him there; their
results only partly confirmed the Copernican hypothesis. Bradley
returned to Wanstead, and engaged George Graham to construct for him a
“zenith sector” telescope enabling him to observe not one star but two
hundred stars in their transit across the meridian. After thirteen
months of observation and calculation, Bradley was able to show an
annual cycle of alternating southward and northward deviations in the
apparent position of the same star; and he explained this alternation as
due to the earth’s orbital motion. This discovery of the “aberration of
light” (1729) explained hundreds of hitherto puzzling observations and
deviations; it made a revolutionary distinction between the observed
position and the “real,” or calculated, position of any star; it agreed
handsomely with Copernicus, since it depended upon the revolution of the
earth around the sun. Its effect upon astronomy was so illuminating that
a French astronomer- historian, Joseph Delambre, proposed to rank
Bradley with Kepler, even with Hipparchus himself. 53</p>
<p>Bradley went on to his second major discovery: the “nutation”—
literally the nodding — of the earth’s axis of rotation, like the axial
vacillation of a spinning top. The stars whose apparent motions had been
described as performing an annual cycle, due to the revolution of the
earth around the sun, did not, in Bradley’s observations, return, after
a year, to precisely the same apparent positions as before. It occurred
to him that the discrepancy might be due to a slight bending of the
earth’s axis by periodic changes in the relation between t he moon’s
orbit around the earth and the earth’s orbit around the sun. He studied
these changes through nineteen years (1728-</p>
<p>47); at the end of the nineteenth year he found that the stars had
returned to exactly the same apparent positions they had had at the
beginning of the first year. He felt certain now that the nutation of
the earth’s axis was due</p>
<p>During Bradley’s tenure as astronomer royal, Britain submitted to a
pain - ful operation: after 170 years of resistance it accepted the
Gregorian calendar, but obstinately named it the Reformed calendar. An
act of Parlia- ment (1750) ordered that the eleven days following the
second of Septem- ber, 1752, were to be omitted from the “New Style”;
that September 3 was</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>54 1</p>
<p>to be called September 14; and that the legal year should thereafter
begin not on March 25 but on January 1. This involved complications in
business dealings and ecclesiastical holydays; it stirred many protests,
and angry Britons demanded, “Give us back our eleven days!” 54 — but in
the end sci- ence triumphed over bookkeeping and theology.</p>
<p>5 . Herschel</p>
<p>English astronomy reached its peak when William Herschel added</p>
<p>Uranus to the planets and abandoned his career as a musician. His
father* was a musician in the Hanoverian army; the son, born in Hanover
in 1738 and named Friedrich Wilhelm, adopted his father’s profession,
and served as musician in the first campaign of the Seven Years’ War;
but his health was so delicate (he lived to be almost eighty-four) that
he was released. In 1757 he was sent to England to seek his fortune in
music. At Bath, which then rivaled London as a center of fashionable
society, he rose from oboist to conductor to organist in the Octagon
Chapel. He composed, taught music, and sometimes gave thirty-five
lessons in a week. At night he un- bent by studying calculus; thence he
passed to optics, finally to astronomy. He brought over from Germany his
brother Jacob and, in 1772, his sister Caroline, who managed their
household, learned to keep astronomical records, and at last became an
astronomer in her own right.</p>
<p>Fired with ambition to chart the skies, Herschel, helped by his
brother, made his own telescope. He ground and polished the lenses
himself, and on one occasion he continued this operation uninterrupted
for sixteen hours, Caroline feeding him as he worked, or relieving the
tedium by reading to him from Cervantes, Fielding, or Sterne. This was
the first of several tele- scopes made by Herschel or under his
supervision. In 1774, aged thirty-six, he made his first observation,
but for many years yet he could give to as- tronomy only such time as
was left him by his work as a musician. Four times he studied every part
of the heavens. In the second of these cosmic tours, on March 14, 1781,
he made his epochal discovery, whose importance he vastly
underestimated:</p>
<p>In examining the small stars in the neighborhood of H. Geminorum I
perceived one that appeared visibly larger than the rest. Being struck
with its uncommon appearance, I compared it to H. Geminorum and the
small star in the quartile between Auriga and Gemini; and finding it so
much larger than either of them, I suspected it to be a comet . 55</p>
<ul>
<li>The name Herschel is typically Jewish, an d the astronomer’s first
biographer, E. S. Holden, thought that the father, who was named Isaac,
was Jewish. The evidence is incon- clusive. The boy received Christian
baptism at an early age. Cf. The Jewish Encyclopedia , VI, 362d, and
Cecil Roth, The Jewish Contributions to Civilization, 189.</li>
</ul>
<p>54 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>It was not a comet; continued scrutiny soon showed that it revolved
around the sun in an almost circular orbit, nineteen times greater than
the orbit of the earth, and twice that of Saturn; it was a new planet,
the first so recog- nized in the written records of astronomy. All the
learned world acclaimed the discovery, which doubled the diameter of the
solar system as previously known. The Royal Society awarded Herschel a
fellowship and the Copley Medal; George III persuaded him to give up his
career as a musician and become astronomer to the King. Herschel named
the new planet Georgium Sidus (Star of the Georges) ; but astronomers
later agreed to call it Uranus, taking it away from the Hanoverian kings
and surrendering it, like nearly all its fellows, to the pagan gods.</p>
<p>In 1781 William and Caroline moved to Slough, a pretty town on the
way from London to Windsor. His modest salary of two hundred pounds a
year could not support him, his sister, and his instruments; he added to
it by making and selling telescopes. For himself he built them even
larger, until in 1785 he made one forty feet long, with a mirror four
feet in diameter. Fanny Burney, daughter of the musician-historian whom
we have often quoted, wrote in her diary under December 30, 1786:</p>
<p>This morning my dear father carried me 〔i.e., drove her, for she was
thirty-six〕 to Dr. Herschel. This great and very extraordinary man re-
ceived us with almost open arms. … By the invitation of Mr. Her-</p>
<p>schel I took a walk . . . through his telescope! and it held me
quite</p>
<p>upright, and without the least inconvenience; so would it have done
had I been dressed in feathers and a bell-hoop — such is its circumfer-
ence. 56</p>
<p>In 1787 Herschel discovered two satellites of Uranus, which he named
Oberon and Titania; in 1789 he found the sixth and seventh satellites of
Saturn. In 1788 he married a wealthy widow; he no longer had to worry
about money, but he continued his investigations with undiminished
fervor. Usually he worked all through those nights when the stars were
out and were not dimmed by too bright a moon. Most of his observations
were made in the open air from a platform reached by a fifty-foot
ladder. Some- times the cold was so severe that the ink froze in the
bottle that Caroline took with her to record his findings.</p>
<p>Carrying on more systematically, and with better telescopes, the work
of Charles Messier and Nicolas de Lacaille in locating and listing
nebulae and star clusters, Herschel submitted to the Royal Society
(1782-1802) catalogues of 2,500 nebulae and clusters, and 848 double
stars. Of these 848 he had himself discovered 227. He suggested that
they might be paired in mutual gravitation and revolution — an
illuminating application of Newton’s</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>theory to interstellar relations. In many cases what had looked like
one star turned out to be a cluster of individual stars, and some of
these clusters, seen in the larger telescopes, proved to be separate
stars at vastly different distances from the earth. The Milky Way, in
the new magnification, was transformed from a cloud of glowing matter
into an immense aggregation and succession of single luminaries. Now the
sky, which had seemed to be merely studded with stars, appeared to be
crowded with them almost as thickly as drops of water in the rain. And
whereas the unaided human eye had seen only stars of the first to the
sixth magnitude, Herschel’s telescopes</p>
<p>One of Herschel’s most brilliant suggestions related to the motion of
our solar system through space. Previous observations had indicated that
certain associated stars had, in recorded time, decreased or increased
their diver- gence from each other. He wondered might not this variation
be due to the motion of the solar system away from the converging — or
toward the di- verging — stars, as two lamps on opposite sides of a
street will seem to con- verge or diverge as we leave or approach them.
He concluded that the solar system as a whole was moving away from
certain stars, and toward a star in the constellation Hercules. He
published his hypothesis in 1783; a few months later Pierre Prevost
announced a similar theory. The rival groups of astronomers, English and
French, were in eager competition and close accord.</p>
<p>A contemporary described Herschel, in his eighty- second year, as “a
great, simple, good old man. His simplicity, his kindness, his
anecdotes, his readiness to explain his own sublime conceptions of the
universe, are inde- scribably ch arming.” 58 In all his work Caroline
shared with a devotion as beautiful as in any romance. Not only did she
keep careful records of his observations, and make complicated
mathematical calculations to guide him, but she herself discovered three
nebulae and eight comets. After Wil- liam’s death (1822) she returned to
live with her relatives in Hanover; there she kept up her studies, and
catalogued still further the findings of her brother. In 1828 she
received the gold medal of the Astronomical So- ciety, and in 1846 a
medal from the King of Prussia. She died in 1848, in her ninety-eighth
year.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>4 . Some French Astronomers</p>
<p>Around the Paris Observatory (completed in 1671) there gathered a
galaxy of stargazers, in which the Cassini family formed through four
gen- erations a successive constellation. Giovanni Domenico Cassini
directed the Observatory from 1671 to 1712. Dying, he was succeeded as
director by his son Jacques, who was succeeded (1756) by his son Cesar
Frangois Cassini de Thury, who in turn was succeeded (1784) by his son
Jacques Domi- nique, who died as the Comte de Cassini in 1 845 at the
age of ninety-seven. Here was a family worthy to be named with the
Bernoullis and the Bachs.</p>
<p>Jean Le Rond d’Alembert had no family, either before or after, but he
gathered sciences around him as one would gather children. Applying his
mathematics to astronomy, he reduced to law Newton’s theory of the pre -
cession of the equinoxes, and Bradley’s hypothesis of the axial nutation
of the earth. “The discovery of these results,” said Laplace, “was in
Newton’s time beyond the means of analysis and mechanics. . . . The
honor of do- ing this was reserved to d’Alembert. A year and a half aft
er the publication in which Bradley presented his discovery, d’Alembert
offered his treatise 〔Recherches sur la precession des equinoxes ( 1
749) 〕, a work as remarkable in the history of celestial mechanics and
dynamics as that of Bradley in the annal s of astronomy.” 59</p>
<p>It is a blot on d’Alembert’s record that he did not enjoy the
successes of his rivals — but which of us has risen to such saintly
delight? He criticized with special zeal the work of Alexis Clairaut. At
ten Alexis knew infinitesi- mal calculus; at twelve he submitted his
first paper to the Academie des Sciences; at eighteen he published a
book containing such important addi- tions to geometry as won him
adjoint membership in the Academie (1731), at an age six years younger
than d ’Alembert was to be on receiving the same honor in 1741. Clairaut
was among the scientists chosen to accompany Maupertuis on the
expedition to Lapland (1736) for measuring an arc of the meridian.
Returning, he presented to the Academie memoirs on geom- etry, algebra,
conic sections, and calculus. He published in 1743 his Theorie de la
figure de la terre, which calculated, by “Clairaut’s theorem,” and more
precisely than Newton or Maclaurin had done, the form that a rotating
body mechanically assumes from the natural gravitation of its parts. His
interest in Newton brought him into touch with Mme. du Chatelet; he
helped her with her translation of the Principia, and shared with
Voltaire the honor of converting French scientists from Descartes’ vorti
ces to New- ton’s gravitation.</p>
<p>In 1746- 49 Euler, Clairaut, and d’Alembert worked independently
to</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>find, by the new methods of calculus, the apogee of the moon — its
moment of maximum distance from the earth; Euler and Clairaut published
approxi- mately the same results; d’Alembert followed with a still more
accurate</p>
<p>1.49 per cent, that of the earth; our current figures are 81.5 and
1.82 per cent.</p>
<p>In 1757 the astronomers of Europe began to look out for the return of
the comet that Halley had predicted. To guide their observations
Clairaut undertook to compute the perturbations the comet would have
suffered in passing by Saturn and Jupiter. He calculated that these and
other ex- periences had retarded it by 618 days, and advised the
Academie des Sci- ences that the comet would be at perihelion (its point
nearest the sun) about April 13, 1759. An amateur watcher discerned it
on Christmas Day, 1758; it passed perihelion on March 12, 1759,
thirty-two days earlier than Clairaut’s reckoning. Even so the event was
a triumph for science and a transient blow to superstition.* Clairaut
presented his studies on the sub- ject in Theorie du mouvement des
cometes (1760). His successes, and his great personal charm, made him a
prize catch for the rival salons. He at- tended them frequently, and
died at fifty-two (17 65). “No French savant of this age merited a
higher renown.” 60</p>
<p>There were many more whom history should commemorate, though it would
spoil the story to tell all. There was Joseph Delisle, who studied the
spots and corona of the sun, and founded the St. Petersburg Observatory;
and Nico- las de Lacaille, who went to the Cape of Good Hope for the
Academie des Sciences, spent ten years (1750-60) charting southern
skies, and died of over- work at forty-nine; and Pierre Lemonnier, who
went with Maupertuis to Lap- land at twenty-one, carried on studies of
the moon through fifty years, analyzed the motions of Jupiter and
Saturn, and observed and recorded Uranus (1768 —</p>
<ol start="69" type="1">
<li>long before Herschel discovered it to be a planet (1781). And Joseph
de Lalande, whose Traite de Vastronomie (1764) surveyed every branch of
the science, taught it at the College de France for forty-six years, and
established in 1802 the Lalande Prize, which is still given annually for
the best contribu- tion to astronomy. And Jean Baptiste Delambre, who
determined the orbit of Uranus, succeeded Lalande at the College, and
added to Lalande’s ecumenical exposition a history of astronomy in six
painstaking volumes (1817 — 27).</li>

<p>He was born (1749) Pierre Simon Laplace, of a middle-class family in
Normandy, and became the Marquis Pierre Simon de Laplace. He made his
first mark by his pious theological essays in school, and became the
most confirmed atheist of Napoleonic France. At the age of eighteen he
was sent to Paris with a letter of introduction to d’Alembert.
D’Alembert, who re - ceived many such letters and discounted their
encomiums, refused to see him. Resolute, Laplace addressed to him a
letter on the general principles of mechanics. D’Alembert responded:
“Monsieur, you see that I paid little at - tention to recommendations.
You need none; you have introduced yourself better. That is enough for
me. My support is your due.” 61 Soon, through d’Alembert’s influence,
Laplace was appointed teacher of mathematics at the £cole Militaire. In
a later letter to d’Alembert he analyzed his own pas - sion for
mathematics:</p>
<p>I have always cultivated mathematics by taste rather than from
de-</p>
<p>sire for a vain reputation. My greatest amusement is to study the</p>
<p>march of the inventors, to see their genius at grips with the
obstacles they have encountered and overcome. I then put myself in their
place, and ask myself how I should have gone about surmounting these
same obstacles; and although this substitution in the great majority of
in- stances has been humiliating to my self-love, nevertheless the
pleasure of rejoicing in their success has amply repaid me for this
little humilia- tion. If I am fortunate enough to add something to their
works, I at- tribute all the merit to their first efforts. 62</p>
<p>We detect some pride in this conscious modesty. In any case Laplace’s
ambition was grandly immodest, for he undertook to reduce the entire
universe to one mathematical system by applying to all celestial bodies
and phenomena the Newtonian theory of gravitation. Newton had left the
cos- mos in a precarious condition: it was, he thought, subject to
irregularities that mounted in time, so that God had to intervene now
and then to set it right again. Many scientists, like Euler, were not
convinced that the world was a mechanism. Laplace proposed to prove it
mechanically.</p>
<p>He began (1773) with a paper showing that the variations in the mean
distances of each planet from the sun were subject to nearly precise
mathe- matical formulation, and were therefore periodic and mechanical;
for this paper the Academie des Sciences elected him to associate
membership at the age of twenty-four. Henceforth Laplace, with a unity,
direction, and persistence of purpose characteristic of great men,
devoted his life to re- ducing one after another operation of the
universe to mathematical equa-</p>

<p>tions. “All the effects of nature,” he wrote, “are only the
mathematical</p>
<p>Though his major works did not appear till after the Revolution,
their preparation had begun long before. His Exposition du systeme du
monde (1796) was a popular and nonmechanical introduction to his views,
notable for its lucid and fluent style, and embodying his famous
hypothesis (antici- pated by Kant in 1755) as to the origin of the solar
system. Laplace pro- posed to explain the revolution and rotation of the
planets and their satel- lites by postulating a primeval nebula of hot
gases, or other minute particles, enveloping the sun and extending to
the farthest reaches of the solar system. This nebula, rotating with the
sun, gradually cooled, and contracted into rings perhaps like those now
seen around Saturn. Further cooling and con- traction condensed these
rings into planets, which then, by a similar process, evolved their own
satellites; and a like condensation of nebulae may have produced the
stars. Laplace assumed that all planets and satellites revolved in the
same direction, and practically in the same plane; he did not know, at
the time, that the satellites of Uranus move in a contrary direction.
This “nebular hypothesis” is now rejected as an explanation of the solar
system, but is widely accepted as explaining the condensation of stars
out of neb- ulae. Laplace expounded it only in his popular work, and did
not take it too seriously. “These conjectures on the formation of the
stars and the solar system … I present with all the distrust
〔defiance〕 which everything</p>
<p>that is not a result of observation or of calculation ought to
inspire.” 64</p>
<p>Laplace summed up his observations, equations, and theories — and
nearly all the starry science of his time — in the five stately volumes
of his Meca- nique celeste (1799-1825), which Jean Baptiste Fourier
called the Almagest of modern astronomy. He stated his aim with sublime
simplicity: “given the eighteen known bodies of the solar system, and
their positions and mo- tions at any time, to deduce from their mutual
gravitation, by . . . mathe- matical calculation, their positions and
motions at any other time; and to show that these agree with those
actually observed.” To r ealize his plan Laplace had to study the
perturbations caused by the cross-influences of the members — sun,
planets, and satellites — of the solar system, and reduce these to
periodic and predictable regularity. All these perturbations, he
believed, could be explained by the mathematics of gravitation. In this
attempt to prove the stability and self-sufficiency of the solar system,
and of the rest of the world, Laplace assumed a completely mechanistic
view, and gave a classic expression to the deterministic philosophy:</p>
<p>We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of
its antecedent state, and as the cause of the state that is to follow.
An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given
instant.</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe,
would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the
largest bodies as well as of the lightest atoms in the world, provided
that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to
analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the
past would be present to its eyes. 〔Cf. the Scholastic conception of
God.〕 The per-</p>
<p>fection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy af-
fords a feeble outline of such an intelligence. Discoveries in mechanics
and geometry, coupled with those in universal gravitation, have</p>
<p>brought the mind within reach of comprehending in the same ana-</p>
<p>lytical formulas the past and the future state of the system of the
world.</p>
<p>All the mind’s efforts in the search for truth tend to approximate to
the intelligence we have just imagined, although it will forever remain
in- finitely remote from such an intelligence. 65</p>
<p>When Napoleon asked Laplace why his Mecanique celeste had made no
mention of God, the scientist is said to have replied, “ Je if avals pas
besoin de cette hypothese- ld” (I had no need of that hypothesis). 66
But Laplace had his modest moments. In his Theorie analytique des
probabilites (1812) — which is the basis of nearly all later work in
that field — he deprived science of all certainty:</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, one may even say that nearly all our knowledge</p>
<p>is problematical; and in the small number of things which we are able
to know with certainty, even in the mathematical sciences themselves,
induction and analogy, the principal means for discovering truth, are
based on probabilities. 67 *</p>
<p>In addition to his epochal and widely influential formulation of
astronom- ical discoveries and hypotheses to his date, Laplace made
specific contribu- tions. He illuminated nearly every department of
physics with the “Laplace equations” for a “potential,” which made it
easier to ascertain the intensity of energy, or the velocity of motion,
at any point in a field of lines of force. He calculated the earth’s
dynamical ellipticity from those perturbations of the moon which were
ascribed to the oblate form of our globe. He de- veloped an analytical
theory of the tides, and from their phenomena he deduced the mass of the
moon. He found an improved method for deter- mining the orbit of comets.
He discovered the numerical relations between the movements of Jupiter’s
satellites. He computed with characteristic pre - cision the secular
(century- long) acceleration of the moon’s mean motion.</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>His studies of the moon provided the basis for the improved tables of
lunar motions drawn up in 1812 by his pupil Jean Charles Burckhardt. And
finally he rose from science to philosophy — from knowledge to wisdom-
in a flight of eloquence worthy of Buffon:</p>
<p>Astronomy, by the dignity of its object matter and the perfection of
its theories, is the fairest monument of the human spirit, the noblest
testimony of human intelligence. Seduced by self-love and the illusions
of his senses, man for a long time regarded himself as the center in the
movement of the stars, and his vain arrogance was punished by the
terrors that these inspired. Then he saw himself on a planet almost im-
perceptible in the solar system, whose vast extent is itself but an in-
sensible point in the immensity of space. The sublime results to which
this discovery has led him are well fitted to console him for the rank
that it assigns to the earth, in showing him his own grandeur in the ex-
treme minuteness of the base from which he measures the stars. Let him
preserve with care, and augment, the results of these noble sci- ences,
which are the delight of thinking beings. Those sciences have rendered
important services to navigation and geography, but their greatest
blessing has been to dissipate the fears produced by celestial
phenomena, and to destroy the errors born from ignorance of our true
relations with nature, errors and fears that will readily be reborn if
the torch of science is ever extinguished. 68</p>
<p>Laplace found it easier to adjust his life to the convulsions of
French poli- tics than his mathematics to the irregularities of the
stars. When the Revo- lution came he weathered it by being more valuable
alive than dead: with Lagrange he was employed to manufacture saltpeter
for gunpowder and to calculate trajectories for cannon balls. He was
made a member of the commission for weights and measures that formulated
the metric system. In 1785 he had examined and passed, as a candidate
for an artillery corps, the sixteen-year-old Bonaparte; in 1798 General
Bonaparte took him to Egypt to study the stars from the Pyramids. In
1799 the First Consul ap- pointed him minister of the interior; after
six weeks he dismissed him be- cause “Laplace sought subt leties
everywhere, . . . and carried the spirit of the infinitely small into
administration.” 69 To console him Bonaparte</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>ABOUT THE EARTH</li>
</ol>
<p>Four sciences studied the earth: meteorology explored its envelope of
weather; geodesy estimated its size, shape, density, and such distances
as in- volved its surface curvature; geology delved into its
composition, depths, and history; geography charted its lands and
seas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Meteorology</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the simple rain gauge, the science of weather used four
measuring instruments: the thermometer for temperature, the barometer
for atmos- pheric pressure, the anemometer for winds, the hygrometer for
moisture in the air.</p>
<p>In or before 1721 Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, a German instrument
maker in Amsterdam, developed the thermometer, which Galileo had
invented in 1603; Fahrenheit used mercury instead of water as the
expanding-contract- ing fluid, and divided the scale into degrees based
upon the freezing point of water (32 0 ) and the oral temperature of the
normal human body (98.6°). In 1730 Rene de Reaumur reported to the
Academie des Sciences “rules for constructing thermometers with
comparable grad ations”; he took the freezing point of water as zero,
and its boiling point as 8o°, and he gradu- ated the scale to make the
degrees correspond to equal increments in the rise or fall of the
thermometric fluid, for which he used alcohol. Anders Celsius of
Uppsala, about 1742, improved Reaumur’s thermometer by re - turning to
the use of mercury, and dividing the scale into a hundred “centi -
grade” degrees between the freezing and the boiling points of water. By
de - termining these points more precisely, Jean Andre Deluc of Geneva,
in 1772, gave the rival thermometers essentially the form they have
today: the Fahrenheit form for English-speaking peoples, the centigrade
form for others.</p>
<p>The barometer had been invented by Torricelli in 1643, but its
readings of atmospheric pressure were made uncertain by factors for
which he had not allowed: the quality of the mercury, the bore of the
tube, and the tem- perature of the air. Various researches, culminating
in the experiments and calculations of Deluc (1717-1817), remedied these
defects, and brought the mercury barometer into its current form.</p>
<p>Divers crude anemometers were made in the seventeenth century. At his
death in 1721 Pierre Huet, the scholarly bishop of Avranches, left a
design for an anemometer (the word was apparently his invention) that
would measure</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>55 1</p>
<p>the force of the wind by funneling it into a tube where its pressure
would raise a column of mercury. This was improved by the “wind gauge”
(1775) of the Scottish physician James Lind. John Smeaton devised
(c. 1750) a mechanism for measuring wind velocity. The best
eighteenth-century instrument for measur- ing moisture was the
hygrometer of the versatile Genevan Horace de Saussure (1783), which was
based upon the expansion and contraction of a human hair by changes in
humidity. William Cullen provided a basis for another type of hygrometer
by noting the cooling effect of fluids in evaporation.</p>
<p>With these and other instruments, such as the magnetic needle,
science strove to detect regularities in the vagaries of weather. The
first requisite was reliable records. Some had been kept for France by
the Academie des Sciences since</p>
<ol start="1688" type="1">
<li>From 1717 to 1727 a Breslau physician kept daily records of weather
re- ports which he had solicited from many parts of Germany; and in 1724
the Royal Society of London began to compile meteorological reports not
only from Britain but also from the Continent, India, and North America.
A still wider and more systematic co-ordination of daily reports was
organized in 1780 by J. J. Hemmer at Mannheim, under the patronage of
the Elector Palatine Charles Theodore; but this was abandoned (1792)
during the wars of the French Revolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>One meteorological phenomenon that sparked much speculation was the
aurora borealis. Edmund Halley carefully studied the outbursts of these
“nor - thern lights” on March 16 -17, 1716, and ascribed them to
magnetic influences emanating from the earth. In 1741 Hjorter and other
Scandinavian observers noted that irregular variations of the compass
needle occurred at the time of the displays. In 1793 John Dalton, the
chemist, pointed out that the streamers of the lights are parallel to
the dipping needle, and that their vertex, or point of convergence, lies
in the magnetic meridian. The eighteenth century, therefore, recognized
the electrical nature of the phenomenon, which is now interpreted as an
electrica l discharge in the earth’s atmosphere, due to ionization
caused by particles shot out from the sun.</p>
<p>The literature of meteorology in the eighteenth century began with
Christian von Wolff’s Aerometricae elementa (1709), which summed up the
known data</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>temperature the differences between the logarithms of the heights of
the mer- cury 〔in the barometer〕 give immediately, in thousandths of a
fathom, the dif- ference in heights of the places where the barometer
was observed.” 71 By at - taching a level to his barometer, Deluc was
able to estimate barometrically the altitude of various landmarks; so he
calculated the height of Mont Blanc as 14,346 feet above sea level.
Horace de Saussure, after ascending the moun- tain and taking barometric
readings at its peak (1787), obtained a measurement of 15,700 feet.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Geodesy</li>
</ol>
<p>Geodesy literally meant “dividing the earth.” To do this neatly it
was necessary to know the shape of the globe. By 1700 there was general
agree- ment that the earth was not quite spherical but ellipsoidal —
flattened a bit at its extremities. Newton thought it was flattened at
the poles; the Cas- sinis held that it was flattened at the equator. To
decide this international is- sue the Academie des Sciences sent out two
expeditions. One, led by Charles de La Condamine, Pierre Bouguer, and
Louis Godin, went (1735) to what was then Peru (now Ecuador) to measure
a degree of astronomic latitude on an arc of the meridian near the
equator.* They found that the distance between one degree of astronomic
latitude and the next, on the meridian passing over their place of
observation, was 362,800 feet. In 1736 a similar expedition was sent to
Lapland, under Maupertuis and Clairaut, to measure a degree of
astronomic latitude on an arc of the meridian at a place as near as
practicable to the Arctic Circle. It reported that the length of a
degree there was 367,100 feet — a little more than sixty-nine miles.
These findings indicated that the length of a degree of astronomic
latitude in- creased slightly as the observer moved from the equator
toward the pole; and the increase was interpreted as due to the polar
flattening of the earth. The Academie des Sciences conceded that Newton
had been vindicated. The measurements taken in these expeditions were
later made the basis for determining a meter, the metric system, and the
precise astronomical time of various localities on the earth.</p>
<p>Bouguer, noting some deflections of the plumb line in the Peruvian
ob- servations, ascribed them to the attractive force of the nearby Mt.
Chim- borazo. By measuring the deflection he estimated the density of
the moun- tain, and on that basis he tried to calculate the density of
the earth. Nevil Maskelyne, astronomer royal to George III, pursued the
quest (1774-78) by dropping a plumb line now on one side, now on the
other, of a granite</p>
<ul>
<li>Astronomic latitude is the angular distance between the equator and
the plumb-line di- rection of gravity at any given place. The meridian

<p>mountain in Scotland. In both cases the line was deflected some
twelve an- gular seconds toward the mountain. Maskelyne concluded that
the density of the earth would bear the same ratio to the density of the
mountain as the gravitational force of the ea rth bore to the twelve
seconds’ deviation. On this basis Charles Hutton calculated the earth’s
density to be approximately</p>
<p>4.5 times that of water — a figure now generally accepted, which
Newton had reached, by a typically brilliant conjecture, a century
before.</p>
<p>3 . Geology</p>
<p>The study of the origin, age, and constitution of the earth, of its
crust and subsurface, of its earthquakes, volcanoes, craters, and
fossils, was still hampered by theological taboos. Fossils were
generally explained as the re lics of marine organisms left on land by
the waters receding after Noah’s Flood, which was believed to have
covered the globe. In 1721 Antonio Vallisnieri, in his treatise Dei cor
pi marini che sui monti si trovano , pointed out that a temporary flood
could not account for so widespread a deposit of marine formations.
Anton Moro, in his volume De ’ crostacei e degli altri marini corpi che
si trovano su’ monti (Venice, 1740), suggested that the fossils had been
thrown up by volcanic eruptions from the sea. Originally the earth had
been covered with water; subterranean fires forced up the underlying
land above the subsiding sea, and created mountains and continents.</p>
<p>Benoit de Maillet left at his death (1738) a manuscript which came to
print in 1748 as Telliamed, ou Entretiens d’un philosophe indien avec un
missionaire franpais. His views were put into the mouth of a Hindu sage,
but it soon appeared that “Telliamed” was “de Maillet” reversed ; and
the storm evoked by the book might have reconciled the author to his
timely death. In his theory land, mountains, and fossils had been formed
not by volcanic eruptions but by the gradual subsidence of the waters
that had once covered the earth. All land plants and animals, Maillet
suggested, had evolved from corresponding marine organisms; indeed, men
and women were evolved from mermen and mermaids who, like the frog, had
lost their tails. The recession of the waters was caused by evaporation,
which reduced the sea level by some three feet every thousand years.
Eventually, Maillet warned, the oceans will quite dry up, and
subterranean fires will come to the surface and consume all living
things.</p>
<p>A year after Telliamed Georges Louis de Buffon issued the first of
his two magistral contributions to a young science still swaddled in
unverifiable speculation. His Theorie de la terre (1749) was written at
forty-two, his Epoques de la nature (1778) was written at seventy-one.
He began with</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Cartesian caution, by postulating an initial push given to the world
by God; thereafter the Theorie offered a purely natural explanation of
cosmic events. Anticipating by two centuries the latest theory of
cosmogony, Buf- fon suggested that the planets had originated as
fragments detached from the sun by the impact or gravitational pull of
some powerful comet; hence all the planets were at first molten and
luminous masses, like the sun today, but they gradually cooled and
darkened in the cold of space. The “days” allowed for the Creation in
the Book of Genesis must be interpreted as epochs. Of these we may
distinguish seven:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The earth took its spheroidal shape as the result of its
rotation,</li>
</ol>
<p>and slowly its surface cooled (3,000 years).</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">

<p>Adding these seven ages together, Buffon noted that they came to
85,000 years. He would marvel at the superior imagination of current
geologists, who allow the earth a history of four billion years.</p>
<p>Buffon founded paleontology by studying fossil bones and deducing
from them the successive epochs of organic life. The first lines of his
Bpoques de la nature display his perspective and his style:</p>

<p>nologie n’eussent placer des fanaux, des flambeaux , aux points les

<p>And then, having come to paleontology only in his advanced years, he
wrote:</p>
<p>With sorrow I leave these fascinating objects, these precious monu-
ments of ancient nature, which my own old age gives me no time to
examine sufficiently to draw from them the conclusions which I en-</p>
<p>vision, but which, founded only on hypothesis, should have no place
in this work, wherein I have made it a law to present only truths based
on facts. After me others will come. 73</p>
<p>The Bpoques de la nature was one of the epochal books of the
eighteenth century. Buffon lavished upon it all his artistry of style,
even (if we be- lieve him) to rewriting some parts of it seventeen
times. 74 And he poured into it all the power of his imagination, so
that he seemed to be describing, across a chasm of sixty thousand years,
the constructions of his thought as if they were events unrolling before
his eyes.t Grimm hailed the book as “one of the most sublime poems that
philosophy has ever dared to inspire,” and Cuvier pronounced it “the
most celebrated of all the works of Buf - fon, in a style truly
sublime.” 78</p>
<p>Meanwhile humbler students sought to chart the distribution of
minerals in the soil. Jean Guettard won the praise of the Academie des
Sciences by his Memoir e et carte miner alogique (1746). While making
this first at- tempt at a geological survey, he discovered extinct
volcanoes in France; he explained surrounding deposits as solidified
lava, and hot springs as the last stages of these volcanic forces. The
Lisbon earthquake stimulated John Mitchell to prepare an Essay on the
Causes and Phenomena of Earthquakes (1760); he suggested that they were
due to the sudden contact of subter- ranean fire and water, producing
expansive evaporation; this found some outlet through volcanoes and
craters, but when such escapes were not avail- able they produced
tremors in the surface of the earth; these earth waves,</p>

<p>t Sainte- Beuve phrased this brilliantly: ‘“Where were you,’ said God
to Job, ‘when I laid the foundations of the earth?’ M. de Buffon seems
to say to us, without excitement, *1 was there.’ ”75</p>
<p>556 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Mitchell suggested, can be plotted to find the focus of the quake. So
geol- ogy, still young, gave birth to the science of seismology.</p>
<p>Stratigraphy too became a specialty: men puzzled over the origin,
com- position, and sequence of the strata in the crust of the earth.
Coal mines of- fered an opening to such studies; so John Strachey gave
to the Royal So- ciety (1719) “A Curious Description of the Strata
Observed in the Coal - mines of Mendip in Som ersetshire.” In 1762 Georg
Christian Fiichsel issued the first detailed geological map, describing
the nine “formations” in the soil of Thuringia, and establishing the
conception of a formation as a suc- cession of strata collectively
representing a geological epoch.</p>
<p>Rival theories fought over the causes of such formations. Abraham
Wer- ner, who for forty-two years (1775-1817) taught at the Freiberg
School of mines, made his professorial chair the popular seat of the
“Neptunist” view: continents, mountains, rocks, and strata had all been
produced by the action of water, by the subsidence — sometimes slow,
sometimes catastrophic — of a once universal ocean; rocks were the
precipitation or sedimentation of minerals left dry by the receding sea;
strata were the periods and deposits of this recession.</p>
<p>James Hutton added fire to water in explaining the vicissitudes of
the earth. Born in Edinburgh in 1726, he became one of that remarkable
group — Hume, John Home, Lord Karnes, Adam Smith, Robertson, Hutche-
son, Maskelyne, Maclaurin, John Playfair, Joseph Black — that
constituted the Scottish Enlightenment. He passed from medicine to
chemistry to geology, and soon concluded that many times the six
thousand years al- lowed by the theologians would be required for the
history of our globe. He noted that wind and water are slowly eroding
mountains and depositing them into the plains, and that thousands of
rivulets carry off material into rivers, which then carry it into the
sea; let this process continue indefinitely, and the grasping figures or
raging claws of the oceans could swallow whole continents. Nearly all
geological formations might have resulted from such slow natural
operations as one might see in any eroding farm or encroaching sea, or
any river digging its own bed with patient pertinacity, leaving the
record of its falling levels on the strata of rocks and soil. Such
gradual changes, Hutton felt, were the basic causes of terrestrial
transformations. “In interpreting nature,” he held, “no powers are to be
employed that are not natural to the globe, no action to be admitted
except those of which we know the principle, and no extraordinary events
to be alleged in order to explain a common ap pearance.” 77</p>
<p>But if such erosion has been going on for thousands of millenniums,
why are any continents left? Because, said Hutton, the eroded material,
accumu- lating at the bottom of the sea, is subject to pressure and
heat; it fuses, consolidates, expands, mounts, emerges from the waters
to form islands,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>mountains, continents. That there is subterranean heat is evidenced
by vol- canoes. Geological history, then, is a circulatory process, a
vast systole and diastole which repeatedly pours continents into seas,
and from those seas raises up new continents. Later students named
Hutton’s theory “vulcan - ism,” from its dependence upon the effects of
heat, or “plutonism,” from the ancient god of the nether world.</p>
<p>Hutton himself hesitated to publish his views, for he knew that they
would be opposed not only by believers in the literal infallibility of
the Bible, but quite as sharp ly by the “Neptunists,” who found an
enthusiastic defender in Robert Jameson, professor of natural philosophy
in the Uni- versity of Edinburgh. Hutton confined himself at first to
expounding his theory to a few friends; then, at their urging, he read
two papers on the subject to the recently established Royal Society of
Edinburgh in 1785. Criticism was polite until 1793, when a Dublin
mineralogist attacked Hut- ton in terms that stirred his ire. He replied
by publishing one of the classics of geology, Theory of the Earth
(1795). Two years later he died. Through John Playfair’s lucid
Illustrations of Huttonian Theory (1802), the con - ception of great
changes produced by slow processes passed into other sciences, and
prepared Europe for Dar win’s application of it to the origin of species
and the descent of man.</p>

<p>But the surface of the earth is more fascinating than its bowels. The
progressive exhibition of the diversities of mankind in race,
institutions, morals, and creeds was a powerful factor in broadening the
borders of the modern mind. Exploration proceeded ever more curiously
and acquisitively into the unknown; not for science’s sake but to find
raw materials, gold, sil - ver, precious stones, food, markets,
colonies, and to chart the seas for safer navigation in peace and war.
Even the voyage of the mutinous Bounty (1789) had for its original
object the transplantation of the breadfruit tree from the South Seas to
the West Indies. The French, the Dutch, and the English competed most
eagerly in the game, knowing that the mastery of the world was at
stake.</p>
<p>One of the most venturesome explorations originated in the mind of
Peter the Great, who, shortly before his death in 1725, commissioned
Vitus Bering, a Danish captain in the Russian navy, to explore the
northeastern coast of Siberia. The Academy of St. Petersburg appointed
an astronomer, a naturalist, and an historian to accompany the
expedition. Proceeding over- land to Kamchatka, Bering sailed (1728) to
67° north latitude, discovered the strait that bears his name, and then
returned to St. Petersburg. On a sec-</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>ond expedition he built a fleet at Okhotsk, and sailed eastward till
he sighted North America (1741 ); so a Dane discovered that continent
from the west as the Norse Leif Ericson had discovered it from the east.
On the voyage back Bering’s ship lost its bearings in a heavy fog, and
the crew spent six months on a previously uninhabited island near
Kamchatka. On that island, which also carries his name, the great Dane
died of scurvy (1741) at the age of sixty. Another vessel in the
expedition discovered the Aleutian Islands. Russia took possession of
Alaska, and missionaries were sent out to acquaint the Eskimos with
Christian theology.</p>
<p>The advance of Russia into America stirred other nations to explore
the Pacific. As part of a war with Spain (1740) England dispatched a
fleet under George Anson to harass the Spanish settlements in South
America. Scurvy decimated his crews, and storms off Cape Horn wrecked
some of his ships; but he forced his way into the South Pacific, stopped
at the Juan Fernandez Islands, and found proof that Alexander Selkirk
(Defoe’s Rob - inson Crusoe) had been there (1704-9); then he crossed
the Pacific, cap- tured a Spanish galleon near the Philippines, took its
treasure of gold and silver (,500,000), crossed the Indian Ocean,
rounded the Cape of Good Hope, eluded the Spanish and French fleets that
sought to intercept him, and reached England June 15, 1744, after a
voyage of three years and nine months. The prize bullion was transported
from Spithead to London in thirty-two wagons to the accompaniment of
martial music. All England acclaimed Anson, and four editions of his
narrative were bought up in one year.</p>
<p>In 1763 the French government sent out a similar expedition under</p>
<p>Louis Antoine de Bougainville, with instructions to establish a
French settlement in the Falkland Islands; their position three hundred
miles east of the Strait of Magellan gave them military value for
control of the passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He accomplished
his mission and returned to France. In 1765 he sailed again, passed
through the strait into the Pacific, reached Tahiti (1768) — which
Samuel Wallis had discovered a year before — took possession of it for
France, discovered the Samoa group and the New Hebrides Islands, rounded
the Cape of Good Hope, and reached France in 1769, bringing from the
Pacific tropics the bougainvillaea vine. His account of his voyage
stressed the pleasant climate of Tahiti and the happy health, good
nature, and easy morals of the natives. We shall find Diderot commenting
enviously on this report in his Supplement au V oyage de
Bougainville.</p>
<p>In 1764 the British government commissioned Captain John Byron to
pick up some useful territory in the South Seas. He landed at Fort
Egmont in the Falkland Islands and took possession of the islands for
England, not knowing that the French were already there. Spain claimed

<p>sion, France yielded to her, Spain yielded to England (1771),
Argentina claims them today. Byron continued around the globe, but left
no further mark on history. In an earlier voyage, as midshipman under
Anson, he had been shipwrecked on the Chile coast (1741); his account of
this was used by his grandson Lord Byron in Don Juan.</p>
<p>For English-speaking peoples the outstanding explorer of the
eighteenth century was Captain James Cook. Son of a farm laborer, he was
ap-</p>
<p>prenticed at twelve to a haberdasher. Finding insufficient adventure
in lingerie, he joined the navy, serve d as “marine surveyor” along the
coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, and acquired a reputation as
mathematician, astronomer, and navigator. In 1768, aged forty, he was
chosen to lead an expedition for noting the transit of Venus, and making
geographical re- searches, in the South Pacific. He sailed August 25 on
the Endeavour, ac- companied by several scientists, one of whom, Sir
Joseph Banks, had equipped the vessel out of his own funds.* The transit
was observed at Tahiti June 3, 1769. Thence Cook sailed in quest of a
great continent (Terra Australis) supposed by some geographers to be
hiding in the south- ern seas. He found none, but he explored the
Society Islands and the coasts of New Zealand, charting them carefully.
He went on to Australia (then known as New Holland), took possession of
the eastern coast for Great Britain, sailed around Africa, and reached
England on June 12, 1771.</p>
<p>On July 13, 1772, with the Resolution and the Endeavour, he set out
again to find the imaginary southern continent. He searched the sea
east- ward and southward between the Cape of Good Hope and New Zealand,
and crossed the Antarctic Circle to 7 1 0 south latitude without seeing
land; then the mounting danger from ice floes compelled him to turn
back. He visited Easter Island, and wrote a description of its gigantic
statues. He charted the Marquesas and Tonga Islands, and called the
latter “Friendly” because of the gentleness of the natives. He
discovered New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and the Isle of Pines (Kunie)
. He traversed the South Pa- cific eastward to Cape Horn, continued over
the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope, sailed north to England,
and reached port July 25, 1775, after a voyage of over sixty thousand
miles and 1,107 days.</p>
<p>His third expedition sought a water route from Alaska across
North</p>
<p>America to the Atlantic. He left Plymouth July 12, 1776, with the
Reso- lution and the Discovery, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope,
touched again at Tahiti, proceeded northeast, and chanced upon his
greatest dis- covery, the Hawaiian Islands (February, 1778) . These had
been seen by the Spanish navigator Juan Gaetano in 1555, but they had
been forgotten by Europe for over two centuries. After continuing
northeast, Cook reached</p>

<p>what is now the state of Oregon, and surveyed the North American
coast up to and beyond Bering Strait to the northern limits of Alaska.
At 70° 41’ north latitude his advance was barred by a wall of ice rising
twelve feet above the sea and stretching as far as the crow’s -nest eye
could reach. De- feated in his search for a Northeast Passage across
America, Cook returned to Hawaii. There, where previously he had
received a friendly welcome, he met his end. The natives were kind but
thievish; they stole one of the Discovery ’ s boats; Cook led a group of
his men to recapture it; they suc- ceeded, but Cook, who insisted on
being the last to leave the shore, was surrounded by the angry natives,
and was beaten to death (February 14,</p>
<p>1779), aged fifty-one. England honors him as the greatest and noblest
of her maritime explorers, an accomplished scientist, a fearless captain
loved by all his crews.</p>
<p>Almost as heroic was the expedition led by Jean Fran§ois de Galaup,
Comte de La Perouse, commissioned by the French government to follow up
Cook’s discoveries. He sailed in 1785 around South America and up to
Alaska, crossed to Asia, and was the first European to pass through the
strait (which till lately bore his name) between Russian Sakhalin and
Japa- nese Hokkaido. Turning south, he explored the coast of Australia
and reached the Santa Cruz Islands. There, apparently, he was
shipwrecked (1788), for he was never heard of again.</p>
<p>Land exploration was also a challenge to the lust for adventure and
gain. In 1716 a Jesuit missionary reached Lhasa, the “Forbidden City” of
Tibet. Carsten Niebuhr explored and described Arabia, Palestine, Syria,
Asia Minor, and Persia (1761). James Bruce traveled through East Africa
and rediscovered the source of the Blue Nile ( 1 768) . In North America
French explorers founded New Orleans (1718) and moved north along the
Missis- sippi to the Missouri; in Canada they struggled to reach the
Pacific, but the Rocky Mountains proved insurmountable. Meanwhile
English settlers pushed inland to the Ohio River, and Spanish friars led
the way from Mexico through California to Monterey, and up the Colorado
River basin into Utah; soon North America would be one of the prizes in
the Seven Ye ars’ War. In South America La Condamine, after measuring a
degree of latitude at the equator, led an expedition from the sources of
the Amazon near Quito to its mouth at the Atlantic, four thousand miles
away.</p>
<p>The mapmakers could never quite keep up with the explorers. Through
half a century ( 1 744-93) Cesar Francis Cassini and his son Jacques
Domi- nique issued in 184 successive sheets a map of France thirty-six
feet long by thirty-six feet wide, showing in unprecedented detail all
roads, rivers, abbeys, farms, mills, even wayside crosses and gallows.
Torbern Olof Bergman, not content with being one of the greatest
chemists of the eight- eenth century, published in 1766 a Werlds

<p>tion, summarizing the meteorology, geology, and physical geography of
his time. He suggested that many islands were peaks of mountain ranges
now mostly submerged; so the West Indies might be the remains of a range
that had connected Florida with South America. Horace de Saussure, after
twenty-four years as professor of philosophy at the University of
Geneva, made famous ascents of Mont Blanc (1787) and the Klein
Matterhorn (1792), and composed voluminous studies of Swiss mountains in
their at- mospheric conditions, formations, strata, fossils, and plants,
making a mar- velous mixture of meteorology, geology, geography, and
botany. Let us remember, when we are told that history is the Newgate
Calendar of na- tions, that it is also the record of a thousand forms of
heroism and nobility.</p>

<p>And so we come to life! Now that the compound microscope had been
developed, it was possible to examine more minutely the structure of
plants, even to the secrets of their sex. Botany graduated from its
servitude to medicine, and Linnaeus mapped the teeming world of life
with the care and devotion of a scientific saint.</p>
<p>His father, Nils Linne, was pastor of a Lutheran flock at Stenbrohult
in Sweden. The son of a clergyman has especial difficulty in preserving
his piety, but Carl managed it, and found, especially in the plant
world, endless reasons for thankfulness to the Creator. And indeed there
are moments when life appears so beautiful that only an ingrate could be
an atheist.</p>
<p>Nils was an enthusiastic gardener, who loved to secure choice trees
and rare flowers and set them in the soil around his rectory as a living
litany of praise. These were Carl’s toys and intimates in boyhood, so
that (he tells us) he grew up with “an unquenchable love for plants.” 78
Many a day he played truant from school to collect specimens in woods
and fields. The father longed to make him a clergyman, for the lad was
the soul of goodness, and might teach more by deed than by creed; but
Carl took to medicine as the only career in which he could both botanize
and eat. So in 1727, aged twenty, he was enrolled as a medical student
in the University of Lund. A year later, with glowing recommendations
from his teachers, he was sent to the University of Uppsala. As one of
five children he could not receive much financial aid from his parents.
Too poor to have his shoes repaired, he put paper in them to cover the
holes and keep out some of the cold. With such incentives to study, he
advanced rapidly in both botany and medicine. In 1731 he was appointed
deputy lecturer in botany, and tutor in the home</p>
<p>562 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>of Professor Rudbeck, who had twenty- four children; “now, through
the grace of God,” he wrote, “I have an income.” 79</p>
<p>When the Vetenskapssocietet (Scientific Society) of Uppsala decided
to send an expedition to study the flora of Lapland, Linnaeus was chosen
as leader. He and his young associates set out on May 12, 1 7 3 2 . He
described the departure in his naturally flowery style:</p>
<p>The sky was bright and genial; a gentle breeze from the west lent
a</p>
<p>refreshing coolness to the air. . . . The buds of the birch trees
were</p>
<p>beginning to burst into leaf; the foliage on most trees was fairly
ad-</p>
<p>vanced; only the elm and the ash remained bare. The lark was singing
far on high. After a mile or so we came to the entrance of a forest;</p>
<p>there the lark left us, but on the crest of the pine the blackbird
poured forth his song of love. 80</p>
<p>This is typical of Linnaeus; he was ever alert, with every sense, to
the sights, sounds, and fragrances of nature, and never admitted any
distinction be- tween botany and poetry. He led his troop over 1,440
miles of Lapland, through a hundred dangers and hardships, and brought
them back safely to Uppsala on September 10.</p>
<p>Still almost penniless, he tried to support himself by lecturing, but
a rival had the lectures prohibited on the ground that Linnaeus had not
yet com- pleted the medical course or taken his degree. Meanwhile Carl
had fallen in love with “Lisa”— Sarah Elisabeth Moraea, daughter of a
local physician. She offered him her savings, he added his own, and, so
financed, he set out for Holland (1735). At the University of Harderwijk
he passed his exam- inations and received his medical degree. A year
later, at Leiden, he met the great Boerhaave, and almost forgot Lisa.
Inspired and helped by that noble- man of science, Linnaeus issued one
of the classics of botany, Sy sterna Na- turae. It ran through twelve
editions in his lifetime; in the first it consisted of only fourteen
folio sheets; in the twelfth it ran to 2,300 pages, in three volumes
octavo. Near Amsterdam he replenished his funds by reorganizing and
cataloguing the botanical collection of George Cliffort, a director of
the East India Company. With incredible industry he brought out in 1736
Bibliotheca botanica, and in 1737 Genera Flantarum. In 1738 he went to
Paris to study the Jardin du Roi. There, without introducing himself, he
joined a group of students to whom Bernard de Jussieu was lecturing in
Latin on exotic plants. One plant puzzled the professor; Linnaeus
ventured to suggest, “Haec planta faciem americanam habet” (This plant
has an American appearance). Jussieu looked at him, and surmised, “You
are Lin - naeus.” Carl confessed, and Jussieu, with the fine brotherhood
of science, gave him an unstinted welcome. 81 Linnaeus was offered
professorships in Paris, Leiden, and Gottingen, but he thought it time
to return to Lisa</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>(1739). Such long betrothals were not then unusual, and in many cases
they probably contributed to stability of morals and maturity of
character. They married, and Carl settled down as a physician in
Stockholm.</p>
<p>For a time, like any young doctor, he waited in vain for patients.
One day in a tavern he heard a youth complain that no one had been able
to cure him of gonorrhea. Linnaeus cured him, and soon other young men
who had been too anxious to prove their manhood came for similar relief.
The doctor’ s practice spread to lung ailments. Count Carl Gustav
Tessin, speaker of the House of Nobles in the Riksdag, became acquainted
with him, and secured him appointment as physician to the Admiralty
(1739). In that year Lin- naeus helped to found the Royal Academy of
Science, and became its first president. In the fall of 1741 he was
chosen professor of anatomy at Upp- sala; soon he exchanged this chair
for that of botany, materia medica, and “natural history” (geology and
biology); at last he was the ri ght man in the right place. He
communicated his enthusiasm for botany to his students; he worked with
them in informal intimacy, and he was never so happy as when he led them
on some natural-history foray.</p>
<p>We made frequent excursions in search of plants, insects, and
birds.</p>
<p>On Wednesday and Saturday of each week we herborized from dawn till
dark. Then the pupils returned to town wearing flowers in their</p>
<p>hats, and escorted their professor to his garden, preceded by
rustic</p>
<p>musicians. That was the last degree of magnificence in our pleasant
science. 82</p>
<p>He sent some of his students to various quarters of the world to
secure exotic plants; for these young explorers (some of whom sacrificed
their lives in their quest) he secured free passage on the ships of the
Dutch East India Company. He stimulated them with the hope of adding
their names to plants in the great system of nomenclature that he was
preparing. They noted that he gave the name camellia to the flowering
shrub that had been found in the Philippines by the Jesuit George
Kamel.</p>
<p>In the Systema naturae, the Genera Plantarum, the Classes Plantarum (
1 7 3 8 ) , the Philoso’phia botanica (1751), and the Species Plantarum
(1753) he built up his monumental classification. In this task he had
several prede- cessors, especially Bauhin and Tournefort; and Rivinus
had already ( 1690) suggested a binomial method of naming plants.
Despite these labors Lin- naeus found the collections of his time in a
state of disorder that seriously hampered the scientific study of
plants. Hundreds of new varieties had been discovered, to which
botanists had given conflicting names. Linnaeus under- took to classify
all known plants first by their class, then in the class by their order,
in the order by their genus, in the genus by their species; so he ar-
rived at a Latin name internationally acceptable. As the basis of his
classifi-</p>
<p>564</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>cation he took the presence and character, or the absence, of
distinctively reproductive organs; so he divided plants into
“phanerogams,” those having visible organs of reproduction (their
flowers), and “cryptogams,” in which (as in mosses and ferns) there are
no flowers producing seeds, and the re- productive structures are hidden
or inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Some timid souls objected that this emphasis on sex would dangerously
influence the imagination of youth. 83 Hardier critics, in the course of
the next hundred years, pointed out more basic defects in Linnaeus’
classifica - tion. He was so interested in finding nooks and names for
plants that for a time he diverted botany from the study of plant
functions and forms. Since a transformation of species would have
confused his system, and would have contradicted the Book of Genesis, he
laid down the principle that all species had been directly created by
God and had remained unchanged throughout their history. Later (1762) he
modified this orthodox attitude by suggesting that new species might
arise by the hybrid crossing of kin- dred types. 84 Though he treated
man (whom he trustfully called “homo sapiens”) as part of the animal
kingdom, and classified him as a species in the order of primates, along
with the ape, his system impeded the develop- ment of evolutionary
ideas.</p>
<p>Buffon criticized the Linnaean classification on the ground that
genera and species are not objective things but are merely names for
convenient mental divisions of a complex reality in which all classes,
at their edges, melt into one another; nothing exists, outside the mind,
except individuals; here was the old medieval debate between realism and
nominalism. Linnaeus (prov- ing himself human) replied that Buffon ’s
eloquence must not be allowed to deceive the world; and he refused to
eat in a room where Buffon’s portrait was hung along with his own. 85 In
a more genial moment he admitted that his arrangement was imperfect,
that classification of plants by sexual ap- paratus left many loose
ends; and in Philosophia botanica he proposed a “natural” system based
upon the form and development of the organs of a plant. His
nomenclature, as distinct from his classification, proved to be a great
convenience, both in botany and in zoology, and with some modifica-
tions it still prevails.</p>
<p>In his old age Linnaeus was honored by all Europe as the prince of
bota- nists. In 1 76 1 he was knighted by the King, and became Carl von
Linne. Ten years later he received a love letter from the second most
famous author of the century, Jean Jacques Rousseau, who had translated
the Philosophia botanica, and had found in botanizing a cure for
philosophy: “Accept, kind sir, the homage of a very ignorant but very
zealous disciple of yours, who owes in great part to meditation on your
writings the tranquillity he enjoys … I honor you, and I love you with
all my heart.” 86</p>

<p>tanical collections were bought from his widow by James Edward Smith,
who joined others (1788) in founding the Linnaean Society of London to
care for the “Linnaean treasure.” From that center a long series of
publica - tions spread the work of the botanist throughout Europe and
America. Goethe named, as the greatest influences in his mental life,
Shakespeare, Spinoza, and Linnaeus. 87</p>
<p>2 . In the Vineyard</p>
<p>Hundreds of devotees carried on the botanic quest. In France we find
one of those virile families where a common dedication unites the
members across the centuries. Antoine de Jussieu, coming up to Paris
from Lyons, rose in 1708 to be director of the Jardin du Roi. His
younger brother Bernard was a lecturer and “demonstrator” there; we have
seen him wel - coming Linnaeus. Another brother, Joseph, went to South
America with La Condamine, and sent the Heliotropium peruvianum for
transplantation in Europe. A nephew, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu,
published in 1789 the work that began to replace the Linnaean system:
Genera plantarum secun- dum or dines naturales disposita. He classified
plants morphologically (ac- cording to their forms) by the presence,
absence, or number of cotyledons (seed leaves) : those plants that had
none he called acotyledons; those with one only, monocotyledons; those
with two, dicotyledons. His son Adrien carried on their work into the
nineteenth century. In 1824 Augustin de Candolle, building upon the
labors of the Jussieus, outlined the classification that is received
today.</p>
<p>The sexuality of plants had been discovered by Nehemiah Grew in or
before 1682, and had been confirmed by Camerarius in 1691. Cotton Mather
reported from Boston to the Royal Society of London (1716) a demon-
stration of hybridization by wind pollination:</p>
<p>My neighbor planted a row of hills in his field with our Indian</p>
<p>com, but such a grain as was colored red and blue; the rest of the
field he planted with corn of the most usual color, which is yellow. To
the most windward side this row infected four of the next
neighboring</p>
<p>rows, … to render them colored like what grew on itself. But on the
leeward side no less than seven or eight rows were so colored, and some
smaller impression was made on those that were yet further distant,
88</p>
<p>In 1717 Richard Bradley proved the necessity of fertilization by an
ex- periment with tulips. From twelve of these, “in perfect health,” he
removed all pollen; “these bore no seed all that summer , while . . .
every one of four hundred plants which I had let alone produced seed.”
89 He studied</p>
<p>S66</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>cross- fertilization, and foresaw some fascinating results. “By this
knowledge we may alter the property and taste of any fruit by
impregnating the one with the farina 〔pollen〕 of another of the same
class” but of a different variety or species. Moreover, “a curious
person may by this knowledge pro - duce such rare kinds of plants as
have not yet been heard of”; and he told how Thomas Fairchild had grown
a new variety “from the seed of a carna - tion that had been impregnated
by the farina of the sweet William.” He found such interspecies hybrids
to be sterile, and compared them with mules.</p>
<p>Philip Miller, in 1721, gave the first known account of plant
fertilization by bees. He removed the “apices” of certain flowers before
they could “cast their dust”; yet the seed of these apparently
emasculated flowers rip - ened normally. Friends questioned his report;
he repeated the same experi- ment more carefully, with the same
result.</p>
<p>About two days after, as I was sitting in my garden, I perceived in
a</p>
<p>bed of tulips near me some bees very busy in the middle of the
flowers; on viewing them I saw them come out with their legs and bellies
loaded with dust, and one of them flew into a tulip that I had
castrated; upon which I took my microscope, and examined the tulip he
flew into, and found he had left dust enough to impregnate the tulip;
which, when I told my friends, . . . reconciled them again. . . . Unless
there be</p>
<p>provision to keep out insects, plants may be impregnated by insects
much smaller than bees. 90</p>
<p>Josef Kolreuter, professor of natural history at Karlsruhe, made a
special study (1760 f.) of cross-fertilization and the physiochemistry
of pollina- tion. His sixty-five experiments had immense influence on
agriculture in several continents. He concluded that crossing is
fruitful only in closely related plants; but when it is successful the
hybrids grow more rapidly, flower sooner, last longer, and produce young
shoots more abundantly than the original varieties, and are not weakened
by developing seed. Kon- rad Sprengel showed (1793) that
cross-fertilization — usually by insects, less often by wind — is common
within a species; and he argued, with warm</p>
<p>In 1759 Caspar Friedrich Wolff, in his Theoria Generationis,
enunciated a theory of plant development usually ascribed to Goethe:</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>567</p>
<p>In the entire plant, whose parts we wonder at as being at first
glance so extraordinarily diverse, I finally perceive and recognize
nothing be- yond leaves and stem, for the root may be regarded as a
stem. . . . All parts of the plant, except the stem, are modified
leaves. 91</p>
<p>Meanwhile a major figure in eighteenth-century science, Stephen
Hales, explored the mystery of plant nutrition. He was another of those
many Anglican clergymen who found no hindrance in their flexible
theology to the pursuit of science or scholarship. Though accepting
divine design, he made no use of this in his scientific inquiries. In
1727 he published his re- sults in one of the classics of botany,
Vegetable Static ks, … an Essay to- wards a Natural History of
Vegetation. His preface explained:</p>
<p>About twenty years since, I made several haemostatical experiments on
dogs, and six years afterwards repeated the same on horses and other
animals, in order to find out the force of the blood in the arteries
〔our “systolic blood pressure”〕. … At which time I wished I could
have</p>
<p>made the like experiments to discover the force of the sap in
vege-</p>
<p>tables; but despaired of ever effecting it till, about seven years
since, I hit upon it while I was endeavoring by several ways to stop the
bleed- ing of an old stem of a vine. 92</p>
<p>Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood in animals had led
botanists to assume a similar circulatory movement of liquids in plants.
Hales disproved this supposition by experiments that showed a tree
absorb- ing water at its branches’ ends as well as by its roots; water
moved inward from branches to trunk as well as from trunk to branches;
and he was able to measure the absorption. Sap, however, moved up from
roots to leaves through the pressure of sap expanding in the roots. The
leaves absorbed nourishment from the air.</p>
<p>At this point the ingenious Priestley illuminated the problem by one
of the most brilliant discoveries of the century — the nutritive
absorption, by the chlorophyll of plants in sunlight, of carbon dioxide
exhaled by animals. He described this part of his work in the first
volume (1774) of his Ex- periments and Observations:</p>
<p>I took a quantity of air, made thoroughly noxious by mice breath-</p>
<p>ing and dying in it, and divided it into two parts; one of which I

<p>other part of the same original quantity of air, and which I had
kept</p>
<p>in the very same exposure, but without any plant growing in it.</p>
<p>After several similar experiments Priestley concluded that</p>
<p>the injury which is continually done to the atmosphere by the
respira- tion of such a number of animals, and the putrefaction of such
masses of both vegetable and animal matter, is in part at least repaired
by the vegetable creation. And notwithstanding the prodigious mass of
air</p>
<p>that is corrupted daily by the abovementioned causes, yet, if we con-
sider the immense profusion of vegetables upon the face of the earth, …
it can hardly be thought but that it may be a sufficient counter-</p>
<p>balance to it, and that the remedy is adequate to the evil. 93</p>
<p>In 1764 the Dutch biologist Jan Ingenhousz, domiciled in London, be-
came acquainted with Priestley. He was impressed by the theory that
plants purified the air by absorbing, and thriving on, the carbon
dioxide exhaled by animals. But Ingenhousz found that plants do not
perform this function in the dark. In Experiments on Vegetables (1779)
he showed that plants as well as animals exhale carbon dioxide, and that
their green leaves and shoots absorb this, and exhale oxygen, only in
clear daylight. So we remove flowers from hospital rooms at night.</p>
<p>The light of the sun, and not the warmth, is the chief reason, if
not</p>
<p>the only one, which makes the plants yield their dephlogisticated air
〔i.e., oxygen〕. … A plant . . . not capable … of going in search</p>
<p>of its food must find, within … the space it occupies, everything</p>
<p>which is wanted for itself. . . . The tree spreads through the air
those numberless fans, disposing them … to incumber each other as
little</p>
<p>as possible in pumping from the surrounding air all that they can</p>
<p>absorb from it, and to present . . . this substance … to the
direct</p>
<p>rays of the sun, on purpose to receive the benefit which that
great</p>
<p>luminary can give it. 94</p>
<p>This, of course, was only a partial picture of plant nutrition. Jean
Sene- bier, a Geneva pastor, showed (1800) that only the green parts of
plants are able to decompose the carbon dioxide of the air into carbon
and oxygen. In 1 804 Nicolas Theodore de Saussure, son of the Alpine
explorer, studied the contribution of the soil, in water and salts, to
the nourishment of plants. All these studies had vital results in the
epochal development of soil fertility and agricultural production in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Here the vision and patience of
scientists enriched the table of almost every fam- ily in
Christendom.</p>

<p>The greatest naturalist of the eighteenth century was born at Mont-
bard in Burgundy (1707) to a councilor of the Dijon Parlement. Dijon was
then an independent center of French culture; it was a competition
proposed by the Dijon Academy that gave an opening to Rousseau’s revolt
against civilization and Voltaire. Georges Louis Leclerc de Buffon
studied at the Jesuit college in Dijon. There he became attached to a
young Eng- lishman, Lord Kingston, with whom, after graduation, he
traveled in Italy and England. In 1732 he fell heir to a considerable
property, bringing him some 300,000 livres a year; now he was free to
abandon the law, for which his father had intended him, and to indulge
his interest in science. On a hill at the end of his garden at Montbard,
two hundred yards from his house, he built a study in an old tower
called the Tour de St.-Louis. Here he secluded himself from six o’clock
every morning, and here he wrote most of his books. Excited by the story
of how Archimedes burned a hostile fleet in the harbor of Syracuse by a
series of burning mirrors, he made eight ex- periments, combining at
last 1 54 mirrors, and thereby setting fire to planks of wood 150 feet
away. 95 For a time he hesitated between “natural history” and
astronomy; in 1735 he translated Hales’s Vegetable Staticks, and
grounded himself in botany; but in 1740 he translated Newton’s Fluxions,
and felt the seduction of mathematics; Euclid joined Archimedes in his
pantheon.</p>
<p>In 1739 he was appointed director ( intendant ) of the Jardin du Roi,
and he moved to Paris. Only then did he make biology his main
enterprise. Under his supervision the royal botanical garden was
enriched with hun- dreds of new plants from every quarter of the earth.
Buffon admitted to the Jardin all interested students, and made it a
school of botany. Later, leaving it in good hands, he returned to
Montbard and his Tour de St.-Louis, and began to organize his
observations into the most famous scientific book of the century.</p>
<p>The first three volumes of the Histoire naturelle, generate et
particuliere, were published in 1 749. Paris was in a mood to learn
science, and now that it found geology and biology dressed in stately,
lucid prose, and illustrated with alluring plates, it made these volumes
almost as popular as Montes- quieu’s L’Esprit des lots, which had
appeared only a year before. Aided in botany by the brothers Antoine and
Bernard de Jussieu, and in zoology by Louis Daubenton, Gueneau de
Montbeliard, and others, Buffon proceeded</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>to add volume upon volume to his opus; twelve more were sent forth by
1767; nine more, on birds, in 1770-83; five on minerals in 1783-88;
seven on other topics in 1774-89. After his death (1788) his unpublished
manuscripts were edited and issued in eight volumes (1788-1804) by
foienne de La- cepede. All in all, the Histoire naturelle finally
comprised forty-four</p>
<p>volumes, which had consumed more than one life in their preparation,
and over half a century in their publication. Day after day Buffon rose
early, walked to his tower, and advanced step by step to his goal.
Having sur- vived some sexual escapades in his youth, he seems to have
put women out of his life until 1752, when, aged forty-five, he married
Marie de Saint- Belon. Though he made no pretense to marital fidelity,
96 he learned to love his wife, as many Frenchmen do after adultery, and
her death in 1769 darkened his remaining years.</p>
<p>The Histoire naturelle undertook to describe the heavens, the earth,
and the whole known world of plants and animals, including man. Buffon
sought to reduce all this wilderness of facts to an order and law
through the conceptions of universal continuity and necessity. We have
noted his theory of the planets as fragments broken from the sun by
collision with a comet, and his “epochs of nature” as stages in the
evolution of the globe. In the world of plants he rejected Linnaeus’
classification by sexual organs as too arbitrary, inadequate, and rigid.
He accepted the Linnaean nomen- clature reluctantly, and on condition
that the names be placed on the under- side of the labels attached to
the plants in the Jardin. 97 His own classifica- tion of animals was
absurd, but confessedly provisional; he arranged them by their utility
to man, and so began with the horse; later, prodded by Daubenton, he
adopted a classification by distinctive characteristics. His
professional critics laughed at his classifications, and questioned his
general- izations, but his readers rejoiced in his vivid descriptions
and the lordly breadth of his views.</p>
<p>He helped to establish anthropology by studying the variations of the
human species under the influence of climate, soil, institutions, and
beliefs; such forces, he thought, have varied the color and features of
races, and have generated diversity of manners, tastes, and ideas. One
of his boldest hypotheses was that there are no fixed and unchangeable
species in nature, that one species melts into the next, and that
science, if matured, could ascend step by step from supposedly lifeless
minerals to man himself. He saw only a difference of degree between the
inorganic and the organic.</p>
<p>He noted that new varieties of animals have been formed by artificial
selection, and argued that similar results could be produced in nature
by geographical migration and segregation. He anticipated Malthus by
observ- ing that the limitless fertility of plant and animal species
repeatedly places</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>571</p>
<p>an intolerable burden upon the fertility of the soil, leading to the
elimina- tion of many individuals and species in the struggle for
existence.</p>
<p>Species less perfect, more delicate, heavier, less active, less
well</p>
<p>armed, have already disappeared, or will disappear. 98 . . . Many
species have been perfected, or made degenerate, by great changes in
land or sea, by the favors or disfavors of Nature, by food, by the
prolonged</p>
<p>influences of climate, contrary or favorable . . . 〔and〕 are no
longer</p>
<p>what they formerly were. 99</p>
<p>Though he conceded a soul to man, he recognized in the human body the
same sensory organs, nerves, muscles, and bones as in the higher beasts.
Consequently he reduced “romantic love” to the same ph ysiological basis
as in the sexual magnetism of animals; indeed, he reserved the poetry of
love to his eloquent descriptions of matings and parentage in birds.
“Why,” he asked, “does love make all other beings happy, but bring so
much un - happiness to man? It is because only the physical part of this
passion is good; the moral elements in it are worth nothing.” 100 (Mme.
de Pompadour reproved him for this passage, but quite amiably.) 101 Man,
Buffon con- cluded, “is an animal in every material point.” 102 And</p>
<p>if we once admit that there are families of plants and animals, so
that the ass may be of the family of the horse, and that one might
differ</p>
<p>from another only by degeneration from a common ancestor, . . . we
might be driven to admit that the ape is of the family of man, that he
is but a degenerate man, and that he and man have had a common an-
cestor. … If the point were once gained that among animals and</p>
<p>vegetables there had been . . . even a single species which had been
produced in the course of direct descent from another species, . . .</p>
<p>then there is no further limit to be set to the power of Nature, and
we should not be wrong in supposing that with sufficient time she could
have evolved all other organic forms from one primordial type.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly remembering Genesis and the Sorbonne, Buffon added:
“But no! It is certain from divine revelation that all animals have
alike been favored with the grace of an act of direct creation, and that
the first pair of every species issued full- formed from the hands of
the Creator.” 103</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Syndic of the Sorbonne, or Faculty of Theology at
the University of Paris, notified Buffon (June 15, 1751) that some parts
of his Histoire naturelle contradicted the teachings of religion, and
must be withdrawn — especially his ideas on the great age of the earth,
the deriva- tion of the planets from the sun, and the assertion that
truth is derived only from science. The author smilingly apologized:</p>
<p>572 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>I declare that I had no intention of contradicting the text of
Scrip-</p>
<p>ture; that I believe most firmly all that is therein related about
creation, both as to the order of time and as to matter of fact. I
abandon every- thing in my book respecting the formation of the earth,
and generally all that may be contrary to the narrative of Moses .
104</p>
<p>Probably Buffon, aristocrat, felt that it would be bad manners to
quarrel publicly with the faith of the people, and that an unmollified
Sorbonne might interfere with his great plan; in any case his work, if
completed, would be an illuminating commentary on his apology. The
educated classes saw the smile in his retraction, and noted that his
later volumes continued his heresies. But Buffon would not join Voltaire
and Diderot in their attack upon Christianity. He rejected the claim of
La iMettrie and other material- ists to have reduced life and thought to
matter in mechanical motion. “Or - ganization, life, soul, are our real
and proper existence; matter is only a foreign envelope whose connection
with the soul is unknown, and whose presence is an obstacle .” 105</p>
<p>The philosophes, however, welcomed him as a powerful ally. They noted
that his enthusiasm and apostrophes were directed to an impersonal
Nature, creative and fecund, rather than to a personal deity. God, in
Buffon as in Voltaire, sowed the seeds of life, and then allowed natural
causes to do all the rest. Buffon rejected design in nature, and
inclined to a Spinozistic pantheism. Like Turgenev he saw reality as a
vast cosmic laboratory in which nature, through spacious eons,
experimented with one form, organ, or species after another. In this
vision he came to a conclusion apparently contradicting his criticism of
Linnaeus; now it was the individual that seemed unreal, and the species
was the relatively lasting reality. But the contradiction could be
resolved: species, genus, family, and class are still only ideas,
constructed by the mind to give some manageable order to our experience
of the confusing profusion of organisms; individuals remain the sole
living realities; but their existence is so brief that to the
philosopher they appear as merely flickering impressions of some larger
and more last- ing form. In this sense Plato was right: man is real, men
are fleeting mo- ments in the phantasmagoria of life.</p>
<p>Buff on’s readers enjoyed these dizzy visio ns, but his critics
complained that he lost himself too recklessly in generalizations,
sometimes sacrificing accuracy in details. Voltaire laughed at his
acceptance of spontaneous gen- eration; Linnaeus scorned his work on
plants; Reaumur had no respect for Buffon on bees; and zoologists were
amused by his classification of animals according to their usefulness
for man. But everyone applauded his style. For Buffon belongs to
literature as well as to science, and only integrated history can do him
justice. Rarely had a scientist expressed himself with such stately
eloquence. Rousseau, himself a master of style, said of Buffon:</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>“As a writer I know none his equal. His is the first pen of his
century.” 106 Here the judicious Grimm, though Rousseau’s foe, agreed
with him: “One is justly surprised to read discourses of a hundred pages
written, from the first line to the last, always with the same nobility
of style and the same fire, adorned with the most brilliant and the most
natural coloring.” 107 Buffon wrote as a man freed from want and dowered
with time; there was nothing hurried in his work, as often in Voltaire;
he labored as carefully with his words as with his specimens. As he saw
a Leibnizian law of con- tinuity in things, so he established one in
style, smoothing every transition, and ordering all ideas in a sequence
that made his language flow like a broad, deep s tream. Whereas the
secret of Voltaire’s style was the quick and lucid expression of
incisive thought, Buffon’s method was a leisurely ordering of spacious
ideas vitalized with feeling. He felt the majesty of nature, and made
his science a song of praise.</p>
<p>He was quite conscious of his literary flair. He delighted to read to
his visitors melodious passages from his volumes; and when he was
elected to the French Academy he took as his theme, on the day of his
reception (August 25, 1753), not some marvel of science, but an analysis
of style. That illustrious Discours, as Cuvier said, “gave at once the
precept and the example,” 108 for it was itself a gem of style. From all
but the French it is hidden in the mountain of his works, and little of
it has come to us but its famous, pithy, cryptic judgment that “the
style is the man.” Therefore let us spread it out here, and look at it
leisurely. Its brilliance is dulled in trans - lation, but even so, and
though cruelly syncopated for our ignoble haste, it can adorn any page.
After some introductory compliments to an audience that included many
masters of style, Buffon proceeded:</p>
<p>It is only in enlightened ages that men have written and spoken well.
True eloquence … is quite different from that natural facility of</p>
<p>speech which is . . . given to all whose passions are strong, . . .
and</p>
<p>whose imagination is quick. . . . But in those few men whose head is
steady, whose taste is delicate, and whose sense is exquisite — and who,
like you, messieurs, count for little the tone, the gestures, and
the</p>
<p>empty sound of words — there must be substance, thought, and reason;
there must be the art of presenting these, of defining and ordering</p>
<p>them; it is not enough to strike the ears and catch the eyes; one
must act upon the soul and touch the heart while speaking to the mind. .
. .</p>
<p>The more substance and force we give to our thought by meditation,
the easier it will be to realize them in expression.</p>
<p>All this is not yet style, but is its base; it sustains style,
directs it,</p>
<p>regulates its movement, and submits it to laws. Without this the best
writer loses himself, his pen wanders without a guide, and throws out at
hazard formless sketches and discordant figures. However brilliant</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>the colors that he uses, whatever beauties he scatters in the
details, he will be choked by the mass of his ideas; he will not make us
feel;</p>
<p>his work will have no structure. … It is for this reason that
those</p>
<p>who write as they speak, however well they speak, write badly; and
those who abandon themselves to the first fire of their imagination</p>
<p>take a tone which they cannot sustain. . . .</p>
<p>Why are the works of Nature so perfect? It is because each work</p>
<p>is a whole, because Nature works on an eternal plan which she never
forgets. She prepares in silence the germs of her production, she</p>
<p>sketches by a single stroke the primitive form of every living
thing;</p>
<p>she develops it, she perfects it by a continuous movement and in a
pre- scribed time. . . . The mind of man can create nothing, produce</p>
<p>nothing, except after having been enriched by experience and medita-
tion; its experiences are the seeds of its productions. But if he
imitates Nature in his procedure and his labor, if he raises himself by
contem- plation to the most sublime truths, if he reunites them, links
them</p>
<p>on a chain, forms of them a whole, a thought-out system, then he</p>
<p>will establish, upon unshakable foundations, immortal monuments.</p>
<p>It is for lack of plan, for not having sufficiently reflected on
his</p>
<p>purpose, that even a man of thought finds himself confused, and knows
not where to begin to write; he perceives at the same time a great num-
ber of ideas; and since he has neither compared nor arranged them in
order, nothing determines him to prefer some to others; he remains
perplexed. But when he has made a plan, when once he has assembled and
placed in order all the essential thoughts on his subject, he will</p>
<p>perceive at once and with ease at what point he should take up
his</p>
<p>pen; he will feel his ideas ripening in his mind; he will hurry to
bring them to light, he will find pleasure in writing, his ideas will
follow one another readily, his style will be natural and easy; a
certain warmth</p>
<p>will arise from this pleasure, will spread over his work, and give
life</p>
<p>to his expression; animation will mount, the tone will be
elevated,</p>
<p>objects will take color, and feeling, joined to light, will increase
and</p>
<p>spread, will pass from that which we say to that which we are about
to say; the style will become interesting and luminous. . . .</p>
<p>Only those works that are well written will pass down to
posterity.</p>
<p>The quantity of knowledge, the singularity of the facts, even the</p>
<p>novelty of discoveries, will not be sure guarantees of
immortality;</p>
<p>if the works that contain them are concerned with petty objects,
or</p>
<p>if they are written without taste or nobility, . . . they will
perish;</p>
<p>for the knowledge, the facts, the discoveries are easily removed and
carried off, and even gain by being placed in more able hands. Those
things are outside the man, but the style is the man himself 〔le style
est Yhomme meme 〕 ; the style cannot be stolen, transported, or
altered; if it is elevated, noble, and sublime, the author will be
admired equally in all times, for only truth is durable and everlasting
. 109</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>“This discourse,” said Villemain, “so admired at the time, seems to
sur - pass all that had yet been thought on the subject; and we cite it
even today as a universal rule.” 110 Perhaps some deductions must be
made. Buffon’s description holds better for prose than for poetry. It
does more justice to the “classic” than to the “romantic” style; it is
in the tradition of Boileau, and rightly elevates reason; but it leaves
too little room for the Rousseaus, the Chateaubriands, and the Hugos of
French prose, or for the enticing confusion of Rabelais and Montaigne,
or for the moving, artless simplicity of the New Testament. It could
with difficulty explain why Rousseau’s Concessions, so poor in reason,
so rich in feeling, remains one of the great- est books of the
eighteenth century. Truth can be a fact of feeling as well as a
structure of reason or a perfection of form.</p>
<p>Buffon’s style was the man, a robe of dignity for an aristocratic
soul. Only in the absorption of his studies did Buffon forget that he
was a seigneur as well as a scientist and scribe. He took in his stride
the multiply- ing honors that crowned his old age. Louis XV made him
Comte de Buffon in 1771, and invited him to Fontainebleau. The learned
academies of Europe and America offered him honorary membership. He
contemplated without qualm the statue that his son raised to him in the
Jardin du Roi. His tower at Montbard became in his lifetime a goal of
pilgrimage rivaling Voltaire’s Ferney; there Rousseau ca me, knelt at
the threshold, and kissed the floor. 111 Prince Henry of Prussia called;
and though Catherine the Great could not manage this, she sent him word
that she counted him second only to Newton.</p>
<p>Even in old age he was stately and handsome — “the body of an
athlete,” said Voltaire, “and the soul of a sage”; 112 looking, said
Hume, not like a man of letters but like a marshal of France. 113 The
people of Montbard adored him. Buffon was fully aware of all this, he
prided himself on his fitness and appearance, and had his hair dressed
and powdered twice a day. 114 He enjoyed good health till he was
seventy-two. Then he began to suffer from stone, but he continued to
work, and refused to permit an operation. He survived nine years more,
and died in 1788. Twenty thou- sand people attended his funeral. Hardly
a year after his death his remains were exhumed, and were scattered to
the winds, and his monument was razed to the ground, by revolutionists
who could not forgive him for hav- ing been a nobleman; and his son was
guillotined. 115</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Toward. Evolution</li>
</ol>
<p>Led by such a master of perspective, patience, and prose, biology
began to lure more and more students from the mathematics and physics
that in</p>
<p>57 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>the seventeenth century had held most scientists in thrall. Diderot,
moved by all the currents of his time, felt something of this change.
“At this moment,” he wrote in 1754, “we touch upon a great revolution in
the sciences. From the inclination that the best minds seem now to have
for moral philosophy, literature, natural history, and experimental
physics, I dare predict that before another hundred years have passed we
shall not count three great mathematicians 〔geometres〕 in Europe.”
1116 (The year 1 859 saw the climax of modern biology.)</p>
<p>The new science was discouraged by its initial problem — the origin
of life. Many attempts were made to show that life could be generated
spon- taneously from nonliving matter. The multitude of micro-organisms
found by the microscope in a drop of water gave new vigor to the old
theory of abiogenesis despite Redi’s apparent disproof of it in 1668. In
1748 John Needham, an English Catholic priest resident on the Continent,
revived the theory by r epeating Redi’s experiments with different
results. He boiled some mutton gravy in flasks, which he immediately
corked and sealed. On opening the flasks a few days later he found them
teeming with organisms. Arguing that any living germs in the broth must
have been killed by boiling, and that the flasks had been firmly sealed
with mastic, Needham concluded that new organisms had been spontaneously
generated in the liquid. Buffon was impressed, but in 1765 Spallanzani,
then a pro- fessor at Modena, repeated Needham’s experiments to a
contrary conclu - sion. He found that boiling an infusion for two
minutes did not destroy all germs, but that boiling it for forty-five
minutes did, and that in this case no organisms appeared. The
controversy continued until Schwann and Pasteur apparently disposed of
it in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Mysteries almost as baffling surrounded the processes of
reproduction. James Logan, Charles Bonnet, and Caspar Wolff puzzled over
the roles of the male and female elements in reproduction, and asked how
the combined elements can — as they seem to — contain in themselves the
predetermination of all the parts and structures in the mature form.
Bonnet proposed a fan- tastic theory of emboitement, or “incapsulation”:
the female contains the germs of all her children, these germs contain
the germs of the grand- children, and so on until imagination rebels;
science too can run to mythol- ogy. Wolff, whose name adorns the
Wolffian ducts, defended Harvey’s th eory of “epigenesis”: each embryo
is created anew by the parental ele - ments. Wolff anticipated von
Baer’s germ -layer theory of organ formation in De Formatione
lntestinorum (1768), which von Baer described as “the greatest
masterpiece of scientific obs ervation that we possess.” 117</p>
<p>Is the regeneration of tissue a form of reproduction? Abraham
Trembley, of Geneva, astonished the learned world in 1744 by experiments
that re- vealed the regenerative obstinacy of the fresh- water polyp: he
cut one</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>into four longitudinal strips, each of which grew into a complete and
normal organism. He hesitated whether to call the polyp a plant or an
animal; it seemed rooted like a plant, but it grabbed and digested food
like an animal; speculative souls hailed it as bridging the gap between
the plant and animal worlds in the “great chain of being.” 118 Trembley
concluded, as biologists now do, that it is an animal. Its squirming,
groping tentacles led Reaumur to call it “polyp,” or many -footed. We
know it also as the hydra, from the legendary monster with nine heads;
as soon as Heracles cut off one of these, two heads grew in its place.
In literature the hydra has served as a simile with a hundred thousand
lives.</p>
<p>Rene Antoine de Reaumur was second only to Buffon in the biology of
this age, and far superior to him in accuracy of observation. Educated
as a physician, he abandoned practice as soon as he was financially
independ- ent, and gave himself to scientific research. He seemed at
home in a dozen fields. In 1710 he was commissioned to survey and
describe the industries and industrial arts of France; he did this with
characteristic thoroughness, and made recommendations that led to the
establishment of new industries and the revival of ailing ones. He
devised the method of tinning iron that is still employed, and
investigated the chemical differences between iron and steel. These and
other contributions to metallurgy won him a pension of twelve thousand
livres from the government; he gave the money to the Academie des
Sciences. We have seen his work on the thermometer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was enriching biology. In 1712 he showed that the
lobster could regenerate an amputated limb. In 1715 he correctly
described the electric shock emitted by the torpedo fish. Between 1734
and 1742 he published his masterpiece, Memoires pour servir i Fhistoire
des insectes — six volumes painstakingly illustrated, and written in a
style of charm and animation that made insects almost as interesting as
the lovers in the ro- mances of Crebillon fils. Like Fabre in our time,
he became fascinated by all</p>
<p>that relates to the character and manners, so to speak, and to the
liveli- hood, of so many little animals. I have observed their different
ways of life, how they get their nourishment, the ruses which some of
them use to seize their prey, the precautions which others take to keep
themselves safe from enemies, . . . the choice of places where to lay
their eggs</p>
<p>so that the young, hatching out, will find suitable food from the mo-
ment of their birth . 119</p>
<p>Reaumur agreed with Voltaire that the behavior and structure of
organ- isms could not be explained without assuming a power of design in
nature; his volumes served as ammunition to those who opposed the
atheistic cur- rent that soon flowed in France. Diderot ridiculed him

<p>much time on bugs, 120 but it was such careful work that laid the
factual foundations of modern biology.</p>
<p>What must Diderot have said when he heard that Reaumur’s friend</p>
<p>Charles Bonnet had demonstrated virgin birth — parthenogenesis — in
the ani- mal kingdom? By isolating newborn aphids (the tree lice that
love our orange trees) he had found that a female of the species can
reproduce fertile offspring without having received the male element
usually required; apparently the purpose of sex was not merely
reproduction, but the en- richment of the offspring through contribution
of diverse qualities from two parents differently endowed. These
experiments, reported to the Academie des Sciences in 1740, were
described in Bonnet’s Traite d’msec - tologie (1745). In Recherches sur
. . . des plantes (1754) Bonnet sug- gested that some plants have powers
of sensation, even of discrimination and selection, therefore of
judgment — the essence of intelligence.</p>
<p>It was this same Geneva-born Bonnet who seems to have first applied
the term evolution to biology; 121 however, he meant by it the chain of
beings from atoms to man. Tbe idea of evolution as the natural
development of new species from old ones appeared repeatedly in
eighteenth-century sci- ence and philosophy. So Benoit de Maillet
suggested in his posthumous Telliamed (1748) that all land animals
evolved from kindred marine or- ganisms through transformation of
species by the changed environment; in this way birds had originated
from flying fish, lions frorh sea lions, men from mermen. Three years
later Maupertuis’ Systeme de la nature not only classed apes and men as
allied species, 122 but anticipated in outline Darwin’s theory of the
evolution of new species through the environmental selection of
fortuitous variations favorable to survival. Said the unfortunate scien-
tist who was soon to fall on the point of Voltaire’s pen:</p>
<p>The elementary particles which form the embryo are each drawn</p>
<p>from the corresponding structure of the parent, and conserve a sort
of recollection of their previous form. . . . We can thus readily
explain</p>
<p>how new species are formed, … by supposing that the elementary</p>
<p>particles may not always retain the order which they present in
the</p>
<p>parents, but may fortuitously produce differences which,
multiply-</p>
<p>ing and accumulating, have resulted in the infinite variety of
species which we see at the present time. 123</p>
<p>In this manner, given sufficient time, a single prototype (Maupertuis
thought) could have produced all living forms — a proposition
tentatively entertained by Buffon, and warmly applauded by Diderot.</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste Robinet returned, in De la Nature (1761), to the
older</p>
<p>idea of evolution as a “ladder of beings” ( echelle des etres) : all
nature is a series of efforts to produce even more perfect beings; in
conformity with</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>Leibniz’ law of continuity (which admitted no break between the
lowest and the highest beings), all forms, even stones, are experiments
whereby Nature works her way upward through minerals, plants, and beasts
to man. Man himself is only a stage in the great enterprise: beings more
per- fect will someday replace him. 124</p>
<p>James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, a Scottish judge, was a Darwinian</p>
<p>nearly a century before Darwin. In The Origin and Progress of
Language (1773-9 2 ) he pictured prehistoric man as having no language
and no social organization, and as in no way distinguished, in mental
attainments or way of life, from the apes; man and the orangutan (as
Edward Tyson had said in 1699) are of the same genus; the orangutan (by
which Monboddo meant the gorilla or the chimpanzee) is a man who failed
to develop. Only through language and social organization did
prehistoric man become primitive man. Human history is not a decline
from primeval perfection, as in Gene- sis, but a slow and painful
ascent. 125</p>
<p>The poet Goethe touched the history of science at several points. In
1786 he discovered the intermaxillary bone, and in 1790 he suggested
that the skull is composed of modified vertebrae. Independently of
Caspar Wolff he reached the theory that all parts of a plant are
modifications of leaves; and he held that all plants descended by
general metamorphosis from one archetype which he called Urpflanze.</p>
<p>Last in the line of eighteenth- century Darwinians is the great
Darwin’s grandfather. Erasmus Darwin was quite as interesting a
personality as Charles. Born in 1731, educated at Cambridge and
Edinburgh, he settled down to the practice of medicine in Nottingham,
then in Lichfield, then in Derby, where he died in 1802. From Lichfield
he rode regularly to Birmingham, fifteen miles away, to attend the
dinners of the “Lunar So - ciety,” of which he was the moving spirit,
and of which Priestley became the most famous member. A bright and
amiable personality shines out in the older Darwin’s letter to Matthew
Boulton apologizing for having missed a meeting:</p>
<p>I am sorry the infernal divinities who visit mankind with
diseases</p>
<p>. . . should have prevented my seeing all your great men at Soho</p>
<ul>
<li>Birmingham〕 today. Lord! what inventions, what wit, what rhetoric —
metaphysical, mechanical, and pyrotechnical — will be on the wing,
bandied like a shuttlecock from one to another of your troop of</li>
</ul>
<p>philosophers! while poor I, . . . imprisoned in a post-chaise, am
jog-</p>
<p>gled, and jostled, and bumped, and bruised along the King’s highroad
to make war upon a stomach-ache or a fever. 126</p>
<p>Amid this busy life he wrote a substantial Z oonomia (1794-96), min-
gling medicine and philosophy, and several volumes of science
poetry:</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Botanic Garden (1788), Loves of the Plants (1788), and The Temple of
Nature (1802). The last boot expressed his evolutionary ideas. It began
by affirming abiogenesis as the most probable theory of the origin of
life:</p>
<p>Hence without parents, by spontaneous birth.</p>
<p>Rise the first specks of animated earth. . . .</p>
<p>Organic life beneath the shoreless waves</p>
<p>Was born and nursed in ocean’s pearly caves;</p>
<p>First, forms minute, unseen by spheric glass.</p>
<p>Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;</p>
<p>These, as successive generations bloom,</p>
<p>New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;</p>
<p>Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,</p>
<p>And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing. 127</p>
<p>So life evolved from marine forms to amphibians in the ooze, and to
the numberless species of sea and land and air. The poet quoted Buffon
and Helvetius on features of the human anatomy indicating that man
formerly walked on four feet and is not yet fully adjusted to an erect
posture. One species of ape emerged to a higher state by using the
forefeet as hands, and developing the thumb as a useful counterforce to
the fingers. In all the stages of evolution there is a struggle among
animals for food and mates, and among plants for soil, moisture, light,
and air. In this struggle (said Erasmus Darwin) evolution took place by
the development of organs through efforts to meet new needs (not by the
natural selection of chance variations favorable to survival, as Charles
Darwin was to say); so plants grow through efforts to get air and light.
In Z oonomia the doctor fore- shadowed Lamarck: “All animals undergo
transformations which are in part produced by their own exertions, in
response to pleasures and pains, and many of these acquired forms or
propensities are transmitted to their pos- terity.” 128 So the snout of
the pig was developed for foraging, the trunk of the elephant to reach
down for food, the rough tongue of cattle to pull up blades of grass,
the beak of the bird to snatch up seeds. To which the doctor added a
theory of protective coloration: “There are organs de - veloped for
protective purposes, diversifying both the form and color of the body
for concealment and for combat.” 129 And he concluded with a majestic
glance over eons:</p>
<p>From thus meditating upon the minute portions of times in which</p>
<p>many of the above changes have been produced, would it be too bold to
imagine, in the great length of time since the earth began to exist,
perhaps millions of years before the commencement of the history</p>
<p>of mankind, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one liv-
ing filament, which the first great Cause imbued with animality,
with</p>

<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>

<p>the power of acquiring new parts, attended by new propensities,</p>
<p>directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations, and
thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own
inherent</p>
<p>activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation</p>
<p>to posterity, world without end? 130</p>
<p>“It is curious,” wrote Charles Darwin, “how largely my
grandfather</p>
<p>. . . anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of
Lamarck in his Xoonomia .” 131 Perhaps the grandfather would not admit
that he was on the wrong track. In any case he had expounded a theory
that is not yet dead, and in his genial way he had struck a blow for
evolution.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>PSYCHOLOGY</li>
</ol>
<p>From minerals to plants to animals to man the scientific quest
advanced. Armed with the microscope, and spurred on by the needs of
physicians, a growing fraternity of students peered into the human body,
and found its organs and functions indisputably similar to those of the
higher beasts. But there still seemed to be a break in the chain of
being: nearly everyone agreed that the mind of man differed in kind, as
well as degree, from the mind of animals.</p>
<p>In 1749 David Hartley, an English clergyman turned physician,
ven-</p>
<p>tured into the gap by founding physiological psychology. For sixteen
years (1730-46) he gathered data; then, in 1749, he published his
Observations on Man. Ambitious to find a principle governing the
relations of ideas as Newton had proposed a principle governing the
relations of bodies, Hart- ley applied the association of ideas to the
explanation not only of imagina- tion and memory, as Hobbes and Locke
had done, but also of emotion, reason, action, and the moral sense. He
pictured sensation as first a vibra- tion in the particles of a nerve
stimulated by an external object, and then as the transmission of this
vibration along the nerve to the brain, like “the free propagation of
sounds along the surface of water.” 132 The brain is a mass of nerve
fibrils whose vibrations are the correlates of memories; one or more of
these fibrils is agitated by an incoming vibration associated with it in
past experience; this reverberation is the physiological concomitant of
an idea. For every mental state there is a corporeal correlate, and for
every bodily operation there is a mental or neural accompaniment; the
association of ideas is the mental side of the association of nerve
vibra- tions aroused by their contiguity or succession in past
experience. Hart- ley’s physiological picture was, of course, highly
simplified, and never touched the mystery of consciousness; but it
shared in reconciling a small minority of Englishmen to the mortality of
their minds.</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Another clergyman, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, approached the prob-
lems of mind from a purely psychological side. Born at Grenoble (1714),
he was educated at a Jesuit seminary in Paris, and was ordained a
priest. Admitted to the salons of Mme. de Tencin and Mme. Geoffrin, he
met Rousseau and Diderot, lost religious ardor, abandoned all sacerdotal
func- tions, and gave himself to the game of ideas. He studied the
historic sys- tems of philosophy, and rejected them in a Traite des
systemes (1749), which voiced the spirit of the philosophes: all these
proud structures of co-ordinated half-truths are fanciful proliferations
from our fragmentary knowledge of the universe; it is better to examine
a part of experience in- ductively than to reason deductively about the
whole.</p>
<p>In an Essai sur Forigine des connaissances humaines (1746) Condillac
had followed Locke’s analysis of mental operations; but in his most
success - ful production, Traite des sensations (1754), he accepted a
more radical view — that the “reflection” in which Locke had recognized
a second source of ideas is itself only a combination of sensations,
which are the sole source of all mental states. An external world
exists, for our most basic sense, that of touch, encounters resistance;
nevertheless, all that we know is our sensations and the ideas that they
generate.</p>
<p>Condillac illustrated this proposition with a famous comparison. Per-
haps he took it from Buffon, but he ascribed it to his late inspiratrice
Mile. Ferrand, who had left him an obliging legacy. He pictured a marble
statue “organized internally like ourselves, but animated by a mind
shorn of all ideas,” 133 possessing only one sense, that of smell, and
capable of dis - tinguishing between pleasure and pain. He proposed to
show how from the sensations of this statue all forms of thought could
be derived. “Judg - ment, reflection, desires, passions, etc., are
merely sensations variously transformed.” 134 Attention is born with the
first sensation. Judgment c omes with the second, which begets
comparison with the first. Memory is a past sensation revived by a
present sensation or by another memory. Imagi- nation is a memory
vividly revived, or a group of memories projected or combined. Desire or
aversion is the active memory of a pleasant or dis- agreeable sensation.
Reflection is the alternation of memories and desires. Will is a strong
desire accompanied by an assumption that the object is attainable.
Personality, the ego, the self, does not exist at the outset; it takes
form as the total collection of the individual’s memories and desires.
135 In this way, from merely the sense of smell — or from any other one
sense — nearly all operations of the mind can be deduced. Add four other
senses, and the statue develops a complex mind.</p>
<p>All this was an interesting tour de force, and it made considerable
noise among the intellectuals of Paris. But critics had no difficulty in
showing that Condillac’s method was as deductive and hypothetical as
anything in</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>583</p>
<p>the systems of philosophy; that he quite ignored the problem of
conscious- ness; and that he had not explained how the original
sensitivity had arisen. A sensitive statue, even if it only smells, is
no statue, unless it be that dig- nitary whom Turgenev described as
posing as proudly as if he were his own monument raised by public
subscription.</p>
<p>In 1767 Condillac was appointed tutor to the future Duke of Parma. He
spent the next nine years in Italy, and composed for his pupil seventeen
volumes which were published in 1769-73 as Corns cF etudes, or Course of
Studies. These volumes are of a high order, but the two on history
deserve a special salute because they included the history of ideas,
manners, eco- nomic systems, morals, arts, sciences, amusements, roads —
altogether a fuller record of “civilization” than Voltaire had given in
the Essai sur les moeurs. In 1780, at the request of Prince Ignacy
Potocki, Condillac drew up a Logique for the schools of Lithuania; this
too was of exceptional excellence. In that year he died.</p>
<p>His influence survived for a century, appearing as late as 1 870 in
Taine’s De F Intelligence. Condillac’s psychology was standard in the
educational system established by the National Convention that governed
France from 1792 to 1795. Anatomists like Vicq- d’Azyr, chemists like
Lavoisier, astron - omers like Laplace, biologists like Lamarck,
alienists like Pinel, psychol- ogists like Bonnet and Cabanis,
acknowledged his lead. Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis, in 1796, described
the brain as “a special organ whose particular function it is to produce
thought, just as the stomach and the intestines have the special
function of carrying on the work of digestion, and the liver that of
filtering bile.” 136 The philosophes who surrounded Condillac ignored
his professions of faith in God, free will, and an immaterial, im-
mortal soul; they claimed that a naturalistic, semimaterialistic,
hedonistic philosophy logically followed from his reduction of all
knowledge to sensation, and of all motives to pleasure and pain.
Rousseau and Helvetius concluded that if the mind of man at birth is
mere receptivity, education can mold intelligence and character with
little regard to hereditary differ- ences of mental capacity. Here was
the psychological ground of many radical political philosophies.</p>
<p>The reaction against materialistic psychology came in France only
after Napoleon had clipped the claws of the Revolution and had signed
the Concordat of 1801 with the Church. It came earlier in Germany, where
the antisensationist tradition of Leibniz was still strong. Men like
Johann Nicolaus Tetens, professor at the University of Rostock, attacked
the school of Condillac as mere theoreticians rather than scientists.
All this talk of “vibrations” and “nerve fluid” was pure hypothesis; had
anyone seen these things? Tetens argued that a scientific psychology
would seek direct observation of mental processes; it would make
introspection its major</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>instrument, and would thereby build up a psychology on a truly
inductive basis. It would soon find that the “laws of association”
formulated by Hobbes, Locke, and Hartley do not correspond with our
actual experi- ence; that imagination often revives or combines ideas in
quite a different order from that in which sensation gave them; and that
links in the chain of association sometimes drop out in a very fanciful
way. Desire seems to be the immanent reality of an organism, and hardly
conforms to mechanical laws. Mind is an active, forming force, not a
“blank paper” upon which sensation writes its will.</p>
<p>So the stage was set for Immanuel Kant.</p>
<p>X. THE IMPACT OF SCIENCE UPON CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>If this chapter, however inadequate, has wound itself out to an
abnormal length, it is not only because we have recognized the
scientists as well as their science as belonging to history, it is also
because the evolution of ideas is our basic interest, and because ideas
played a role in the eighteenth century next only to the nature of man
himself. If the achievements of science in that revolutionary era were
not as startling as those of the pre- ceding century from Galileo and
Descartes to Newton and Leibniz, they entered more powerfully into
almost every phase of European history. Through Voltaire and a hundred
lesser exegetes the results of research were spread in the middle and
upper classes; the new sciences of chemistry, geology, and zoology
joined in the slow but profound impress of expand- ing knowledge upon
the literate mind; and the effects were endless.</p>
<p>The influence of science, strange to say, was least and last upon
tech- nology. Man’s wa ys of sowing and reaping, mining and
manufacturing, building and transporting, had been formed through
centuries of trial and error, and traditions and inertia only
reluctantly accepted improvements suggested by laboratory experiments;
not till the end of this era did science accelerate the Industrial
Revolution. Even so, the first stages of that revolu- tion owed a great
deal to chemical researches on dyes; the use of chlorine for bleaching
textiles was established by Berthollet (1788), and the indus - trial
manufacture of soda and sal ammoniac was introduced by James Hutton and
Nicolas Leblanc. The study of gases by Boyle and Mariotte, and of heat
by Black, shared in the development of the steam engine — which,
however, was due chiefly to mechanics on the scene. As the cen- tury
proceeded, a closer rapport grew between practical men seeking
production and scientists seeking truth; the Academie des Sciences sent
in- vestigators into fields, factories, and workshops, and issued twenty
volumes of Descriptions des arts et metiers (1761-81). In return the
burgeoning</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI )</p>
<p>THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE</p>
<p>industries began to call upon science for data and experiments; so
Coulomb reduced to reliable formulas the tension of beams, and the
problems of the steam engine stimulated science to new researches in the
relation between force and heat. In the nineteenth century these
liaisons were to transform the economic and physical world.</p>
<p>The major impact of science was naturally upon philosophy, for
philos- ophy, which is the quest of wisdom, must build upon science,
which is the pursuit of knowledge. At every step science seemed to
enlarge the world in complexity and scope, and new perspectives had to
be formed. It was no small adjustment that the human mind had to make
after discovering that man was not the center of the universe but an
atom and moment in the baffling immensities of space and time; that
adjustment has not yet been made. By a proud response as old as
Copernicus man was almost overcome by the grandeur of his discovery of
his littleness; the pride of science ob- scured the modesty of
philosophy; men conceived new utopias in terms of science, and the idea
of progress offered a new religion to the modern soul.</p>
<p>The effect of science upon religion — or rather upon Christianity —
seemed lethal. Doubtless men would continue to form or favor conceptions
of the world that would give hope and consolation, meaning and dignity,
to harassed, fleeting lives; but how could the Christian epos of
creation, orig- inal sin, and divine redemption stand up in a
perspective that reduced the earth to a speck among a million stars?
What was man that the God of such a universe should be mindful of him?
How could the poetry of Gene- sis survive the explorations of geology?
And what of the dozen or more religions in regions now opened up by
geography? — were they clearly in- ferior to Christianity in their
doctrines or their moral codes and results? How could the miracles of
Christ, not to mention those widely ascribed to saints and Satan, be
reconciled with the apparent reign of universal law? How could the soul
or mind of man be immortal when it seemed so de- pendent upon the nerves
and other tissues visibly doomed to decay? What must happen to the
religion so challenged by a science daily growing in scope,
achievements, and prestige? And what must happen to a civiliza- tion
based upon a moral code based upon that religion?</p>
