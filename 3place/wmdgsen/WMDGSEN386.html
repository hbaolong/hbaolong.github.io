<h4 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h4>
<p>The Popes in Avignon</p>
<p>1309-77</p>
<p>I. THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY</p>
<p>I N 1309 Pope Clement V removed the papacy from Rome to Avignon.</p>
<p>He was a Frenchman, the former bishop of Bordeaux; he owed his ele-
vation to Philip IV of France, who had startled all Christendom by not
only defeating Pope Boniface VIII but arresting him, humiliating him,
and almost starving him to death. Clement’s life would be unsafe in a
Rome that reserved to itself the right to maltreat a pope, and resented
the insolent irreverence of the King; moreover, the French cardinals
formed now a large majority in the Sacred College, and refused to
entrust themselves to Italy. So Clement stayed awhile at Lyons and
Poitiers; then, hoping to be less subject to Philip in a territory owned
by the king of Naples as count of Provence, he took up his residence in
Avignon, just across the Rhone from fourteenth-century France.</p>
<p>The immense effort of the papacy from Gregory VII (1073-85) to</p>
<p>Boniface VIII (1294-1303) to form a European world state by subordi-
nating the kings to the popes had failed; nationalism had triumphed over
a theocratic federalism; even in Italy the republics of Florence and
Venice, the city-states of Lombardy, and the Kingdom of Naples rejected
ec- clesiastical control; a republic twice raised its head in Rome; and
in the other Papal States* military adventurers or feudal magnates —
Baglioni, Bentivogli, Malatestas, Manfredi, Sforzas — were replacing the
vicars of the Church with their own swashbuckling authority. The papacy
in Rome had wielded the prestige of centuries, and the nations had
learned to do it homage and send it fees; but a papacy of continuously
French pontiffs</p>
<ul>
<li>The Papal States may be listed under four provinces:</li>
</ul>
<p>I. LATIUM, containirtg the cities of Tivoli, Civita Castellana,
Subiaco, Viterbo, Anagni, Ostia, and Rome;</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>UMBRIA, with Narni, Spoleto, Foligno, Assisi, Perugia, and
Gubbio;</p></li>
<li><p>THE MARCHES, with Ascoli, Loreto, Ancona, Senigailia, Urbino,
Camerino, Fabri- ano, and Pesaro; and</p></li>
<li><p>THE ROMAGNA, with Rimini, Cesena, Forli, Faenza, Ravenna, Imola,
Bologna, and Ferrara.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>49</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>(1305-78), almost imprisoned by the kings of France, and lending them
great sums. to carry on their wars, seemed to Germany, Bohemia, Italy,
and England a hostile power, the psychological weapon of the French
monarchy. Increasingly those nations ignored its excommunications and
interdicts, and only with rising reluctance yielded it a declining
reverence.</p>
<p>Against these difficulties Clement V labored with patience, if not
with fortitude. He bowed as little as he could to Philip IV, who held
over</p>
<p>Clement’s head the threat of a scandalous post -mortem inquest into
the private conduct and beliefs of Boniface VIII. Harassed for funds,
the</p>
<p>Pope sold ecclesiastical benefices to the highest bidder; but he lent
tacit approval to the merciless reports that the mayor of Angers and the
bishop of Mende presented on the subject of clerical morals and Church
reform to the Council of Vienne ( 1 3 1 1 ) , 1 He himself led a clean
and frugal life, and practised an undemonstrative piety. He protected
the great physician and critic of the Church, Arnold of Villanova, from
persecution for</p>
<p>heresy; he reorganized medical studies at Montpellier on Greek and
Arabic texts, and tried — though he failed — to establish chairs of
Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic in the universities. To all his troubles was
added a painful disease — lupulus, probably a fistula — which compelled
him to shun society, and killed him in 1314. In a better environment he
would have been an ornament to the Church.</p>
<p>The chaotic interregnum that followed revealed the temper of the
times. Dante wrote to the Italian cardinals urging them to hold out for
an Italian pope and a return to Rome; but only six of the twenty-three
cardinals were Italian; and when the conclave met in a locked room* at
Carpentras, near Avignon, it was surrounded by a Gascon populace that
shouted: “Death to the Italian cardinals!” The houses of these prelates
were at - tacked and destroyed; the crowd set fire to the building that
housed the conclave; the cardinals broke a passage through the rear
wall, and fled from the fire and the mob. For two years no further
attempt was made to choose a pope. Finally at Lyons, under the
protection of French sol- diery, the cardinals raised to the papacy a
man already seventy-two years of age, who might reasonably be expected
to die soon, but who was des- tined to rule the Church for eighteen
years with rugged zeal, insatiable avidity, and imperial will. John XXII
had been born at Cahors in southern France, the son of a cobbler; it was
the second time that a cobbler’s son</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 1 274 it had been the custom to lock up the cardinals when
they met in conclave ( con clave , with a key) to choose a pope.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE POPES IN AVIGNON</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>had risen, by the remarkable democracy of an authoritarian Church, to
the highest place in Christendom; Urban IV (1261-4) had shown the way.
Employed as a teacher for the children of the French king of Naples,
John studied civil and canon law with such aptitude that the king took
him into favor. On the king’s recommendation Boniface VIII made him
bishop of Frejus, and Clement V raised him to the see of Avignon. At
Carpentras the gold of Robert of Naples silenced the patriotism of the
Italian cardi- nals, and the cobbler’s son became one of the strongest
of the popes.</p>
<p>He displayed abilities rarely combined: scholarly studies and
administra- tive skill. Under his leadership the Avignon papacy
developed a compe- tent, if corrupt, bureaucratic organization, and a
fiscal staff that shocked the envious chancelleries of Europe with its
capacity for gathering reve- nues. John undertook a dozen major
conflicts that called for funds; like his predecessor he sold benefices,
but without a blush; by sundry devices this scion of the banking town of
Cahors so fattened the papal treasury that at his death it held
18,000,000 gold florins (50,000,000), and 7,000,- 000 in plate and
jewelry. 2 He explained that the papal Curia had lost much of its income
from Italy, and had to build its offices, staff, and serv-</p>
<p>ices anew. John seems to have felt that he could serve God best by
win- ning Mammon to his side. His personal habits tended to an
abstemious simplicity. 3</p>
<p>Meanwhile he patronized learning, shared in establishing medical
schools at Perugia and Cahors, helped universities, founded a Latin
college in Armenia, fostered the study of Oriental languages, fought
alchemy and magic, spent days and nights in scholastic studies, and
ended as a theologian suspected of heresy. Perhaps to check the spread
of a mysticism that claimed direct contact with God, John ventured to
teach that no one — not even the Mother of God — can attain to the
Beatific Vision until the Last Judgment. A storm of protest arose among
the eschatological experts; the University of Paris denounced the Pope’s
view, a church synod at Vin - cennes condemned it as heresy, and Philip
VI of France ordered him to reform his theology. 4 The crafty
nonagenarian eluded them all by dying (i334&gt;-</p>
<p>John’s successor was a man of gentler mold. Benedict XII, the son of
a baker, tried to be a Christian as well as a pope; he resisted the
temptation to distribute offices among his relatives; he earned an
honorable hostility by bestowing benefices for merits, not for fees; he
repressed bribery and corruption in all branches of Church
administration; he alienated the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>5*</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>mendicant orders by commanding them to reform; he was never known to
be cruel or to shed blood in war. All the forces of corruption rejoiced
at his early death (1342).</p>
<p>Clement VI, born of a noble house in Limousin, was accustomed to</p>
<p>luxury, gaiety, and art, and could not understand why a pope should
be austere when the papal treasury was full. Almost all who came to him
for appointments secured them; no one, he said, should depart from him
un- satisfied. He announced that any poor clergyman who should come to
him within the next two months would partake of his bounty; an eyewit-
ness reckoned that 100,000 came. 5 He gave rich gifts to artists and
poets; maintained a stud of horses equal to any in Christendom; admitted
women freely to his court, enjoyed their charms, and mingled with them
in Gallic gallantry. The countess of Turenne was so close to him that
she sold ec- clesiastical preferments with careless publicity. 6 Hearing
of Clement’s good nature, the Romans sent an embassy inviting him to
reside in Rome. He did not relish the prospect, but he appeased them by
declaring that the jubilee, which Boniface VIII had established in 1300
for every hundred years, should be celebrated every half century. Rome
rejoiced at the news, deposed Rienzo, and renewed its political
submission to the popes.</p>
<p>Under Clement VI Avignon became the capital not only of the religion
but of the politics, culture, pleasure, and corruption of the Latin
world. Now the administrative machinery of the Church took its
definitive form: an Apostolic Chamber ( camera apostolica ) in charge of
finances, and headed by a papal chamberlain {earner arius) who was
second in dignity to the pope alone; a Papal Chancery ( cancelleria )
whose seven agencies, directed by a cardinal vice-chancellor, handled
the complex correspond- ence of the See; a Papal Judiciary composed of
prelates and laymen learned in canon law, and including the Consistory —
the pope and his cardinals acting as a court of appeals; and an
Apostolic Penitentiary — a college of clergy who dealt with marital
dispensations, excommunication and inter- dict, and heard the
confessions of those seeking papal absolution.</p>
<p>To house the pope and his aides, these ministries and agencies, their
staffs and servants, Benedict XII began, and Urban V completed, the im-
mense Palace of the Popes, a congeries of Gothic buildings — living
cham- bers, council halls, chapels, and offices — enclosing two courts,
and them- selves enclosed by mighty ramparts whose height and breadth
and massive towers suggest that the popes, if besieged, would rely on no
miracle for their defense. Benedict XII invited Giotto to come and
decorate the palace and the adjoining cathedral; Giotto planned to come,
but died; and in 1338</p>
<p>THE POPES IN AVIGNON</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>CHAP. II )</p>
<p>Benedict summoned from Siena Simone Martini, whose frescoes, now ob-
literated, marked the zenith of painting in Avignon. Around this palace,
in lesser palaces, mansions, tenements, and hovels, gathered a great
popula- tion of prelates, envoys, lawyers, merchants, artists, poets,
servants, sol- diers, beggars, and prostitutes of every grade from
cultured courtesans to tavern tarts. Here, for the most part, dwelt
those bishops in partibus infidelium who were appointed to sees that had
fallen into the hands of non-Christians.</p>
<p>We, who are inured to colossal figures, can imagine the amount of</p>
<p>money required to support this complex administrative establishment
and its entourage. Several sources of income were nearly dried up:
Italy, deserted by the papacy, sent hardly anything; Germany, at odds
with John XXII, sent half its usual tribute; France, holding the Church
almost at its mercy, appropriated for secular purposes a large part of
French ec- clesiastical revenues, and borrowed heavily from the papacy
to finance the Hun dred Years’ War; England severely restricted the flow
of money to a Church that was in effect an ally of France. To meet this
situation the Avignon popes were driven to develop every trickle of
revenue. Each bishop or abbot, whether appointed by pope or secular
prince, transmitted to the Curia, as an inaugural fee, one third of his
prospective income for a year, and paid exasperating gratuities to the
numerous intermediaries who had supported his nomination. If he became
an archbishop he had to pay a substantial fee for the archiepiscopal
pallium — a circular band of white wool, worn over the chasuble as the
insignia of his office. When a new pontiff was elected, every
ecclesiastical benefice or office sent him its full revenue for one year
(annates), and thereafter a tenth of its revenue in each year;
additional voluntary contributions were expected from time to time. On
the death of any cardinal, archbishop, bishop, or abbot, his per- sonal
possessions and effects belonged to the papacy. In the interim be- tween
such death and the installation of a new appointee the popes re- ceived
the revenues, and paid the expenses, of the benefice; and they were
accused of deliberately extending this interval. Every ecclesiastical
ap- pointee was held responsible for dues unpaid by his predecessors. As
bishops and abbots were in many cases feudal proprietors of estates re-
ceived in fief from the king, they had to pay him tribute and provide
him with soldiery, so that many were hard pressed to meet their combined
ec- clesiastical and secular obligations; and as the papal exactions
were more severe than the state’s, we find the hierarchy sometimes
supporting the king against the pope. The Avignon pontiffs almost
completely ignored</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>the ancient rights of cathedral chapters or monastic councils to
choose bishops or abbots; and these by-passed collators joined in the
accumulating resentment. Cases tried in the Papal Judiciary usually
required the ex- pensive help of lawyers, who had to pay an annual fee
for license to plead in the papal courts. Every judgment or favor
received from the Curia expected a gift in acknowledgment; even
permission to be ordained had to be bought. The secular governments of
Europe looked with awe and fury upon the fiscal machinery of the popes.
7</p>
<p>Protests arose from every quarter, and not least vigorously from
church- men themselves. The Spanish prelate Alvaro Pelayo, though
thoroughly loyal to the papacy, wrote On the Lamentation of the Church ,
in which he mourned that “Whenever I entered the chambers of the
ecclesiastics of the papal court, I found brokers and clergy engaged in
weighing and reckoning the money that lay in heaps before them. . . .
Wolves are in control of the Church, and feed on the blood” of the
Christian flock. 8 Cardinal Napoleone Orsini was disturbed to find that
nearly all the bish- oprics of Italy were the object of barter or family
intrigue under Clem- ent V. Edward III of England, himself adept in
taxation, reminded Clem- ent VI that “the successor of the Apostles was
commissioned to lead the Lord’s sheep to the pasture, not to fleece
them,” 9 and the English parlia - ment passed several statutes to check
the taxing power of the popes in Britain. In Germany papal collectors
were hunted down, imprisoned, mutilated, in some cases strangled. In
1372 the clergy of Cologne, Bonn, Xanten, and Mainz bound themselves by
oath not to pay the tithe de- manded by Gregory XI. In France many
benefices were ruined by a</p>
<p>tragic combination of war, the Black Death, pillage by brigands, and
the exactions of papal collectors; many pastors abandoned their
parishes.</p>
<p>To such complaints the popes replied that ecclesiastical
administration required all these funds, that incorruptible agents were
hard to find, and that they themselves were in a sea of troubles.
Probably under duress, Clement VI lent Philip VI of France 592,000 gold
florins (4,800,000), and 3,517,000 more (7,925,000) to King John II. 10
Great outlays were required to reconquer the lost papal states in Italy.
Despite all taxes the popes suffered dire deficits. John XXII rescued
the papal treasury by paying into it 440,000 florins from his personal
funds; Innocent VI sold his silver plate, his jewelry and works of art;
Urban V had to borrow 30,000 florins from his cardinals; Gregory XI owed
120,000 francs when he died.</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE POPES IN AVIGNON 55</p>
<p>Critics retorted that deficits were caused not by legitimate outlays
but by the worldly luxury of the papal court and its hangers-on. Clement
VI was surrounded by male and female relatives attired in precious
stuffs and furs; by knights, squires, sergeants at arms, chaplains,
ushers, chamberlains, musicians, poets, artists, doctors, scientists,
tailors, philosophers, and chefs who were the envy of kings — all in
all, some four hundred persons, all fed, clothed, lodged, and salaried
by a lovably lavish Pope who had never known the cost of money. Clement
thought of himself as a ruler who had to awe his subjects and impress
ambassadors by “conspicuous consump - tion” after the custom of kings.
The cardinals too, as the royal council of a state as well as the
princes of the Church, had to maintain establishments befitting their
dignity and power; their retinues, equipages, banquets were the talk of
the town. Perhaps Cardinal Bernard of Garves overdid it, who hired
fifty-one dwellings to house his retainers; and Cardinal Peter of
Banhac, five of whose ten stables sheltered thirty-nine horses in
comfort and style. Even bishops fell in line, and, despite remonstrances
from provincial synods, kept rich establishments with jesters, falcons,
and dogs.</p>
<p>Avignon now assumed the morals, as well as the manners, of royal</p>
<p>courts. Venality there was notorious. Guillaume Durand, Bishop of</p>
<p>Mende, reported to the Council of Vienne:</p>
<p>The whole Church might be reformed if the Church of Rome would</p>
<p>begin by removing evil examples from itself … by which men are</p>
<p>scandalized, and the whole people, as it were, infected. . . . For in
all lands . . . the holy Church of God, and especially the most holy</p>
<p>Church of Rome, is in evil repute; and all cry and publish it
abroad</p>
<p>that within her bosom all men, from the greatest unto even the</p>
<p>least, have set their hearts upon covetousness. . . . That the
whole</p>
<p>Christian folk take from the clergy pernicious examples of
gluttony</p>
<p>is clear and notorious, since the said clergy feast more
luxuriously</p>
<p>and splendidly, and with more dishes, than princes and kings . 11</p>
<p>And Petrarch, a master of words, exhausted his vocabulary of
vituperation to brand Avignon as</p>
<p>the impious Babylon, the hell on earth, the sink of vice, the
sewer</p>
<p>of the world. There is in it neither faith nor charity nor religion
nor</p>
<p>the fear of God. . . . All the filth and wickedness of the world
have</p>
<p>run together here. . . . Old men plunge hot and headlong into the</p>
<p>arms of Venus; forgetting their age, dignity, and powers, they
rush</p>
<p>into every shame, as if all their glory consisted not in the cross
of</p>
<p>5 &lt;*</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>Christ but in feasting, drunkenness, and unchastity. . . .
Fornica-</p>
<p>tion, incest, rape, adultery are the lascivious delights of the
pontifi-</p>
<p>cal games. 12</p>
<p>Such testimony, from an eyewitness who never veered from orthodoxy,
cannot be entirely disregarded, but it has the ring of exaggeration and
personal resentment. Some discount must be made from it as the cry of a
man who hated Avignon for snatching the papacy from Italy; who</p>
<p>begged for benefices from the Avignon popes, received many, and asked
for more; who consented to live with the murderous and antipapal Vis-
conti, and had two bastards of his own. Morals in Rome, to which
Petrarch importuned the popes to return, were then no better than in
Avignon, except as poverty is an aid to chastity. St. Catherine of Siena
was not as vivid as the poet in describing Avignon, but she told Gregory
XI that at the papal court “her nostrils were assailed by the odors of
hell.” 18</p>
<p>Amid the moral decay there were many prelates who were worthy of
their calling, and preferred the morals of Christ to those of their
time. When we reflect that of the seven Avignon popes only one lived a
life of worldly pleasure, and another, John XXII, however rapacious and
severe, disciplined himself to ascetic austerity, and another, Gregory
XI, though merciless in war was in peace a man of exemplary morals and
piety, and three — Benedict XII, Innocent VI, and Urban V — were men of
almost saintly life, we cannot hold the popes responsible for all the
vice that gathered in papal Avignon. The cause was wealth, which has had
like results in other times — in the Rome of Nero, the Rome of Leo X,
the Paris of Louis XIV, the New York and Chicago of today. And as in
these last cities we perceive that the vast majority of men and women
lead decent lives, or practise their vices modestly, so we may presume
that even in Avignon the lecher and the courtesan, the glutton and the
thief, the crooked lawyer and the dishonest judge, the worldly cardinal
and the faithless priest, were exceptions standing out more vividly than
elsewhere because surveyed, and sometimes condoned, by the Apostolic
See.</p>
<p>The scandal was real enough to share with the flight from Rome in</p>
<p>undermining the prestige and authority of the Church. As if to
confirm the suspicion that they were no longer a world power but merely
the tools of France, the Avignon popes named 1 1 3 Frenchmen to the
college of cardinals in a total of 1 34 nominations. 14 Hence the
connivance of the English government at Wyclif’s uncompromising attacks
upon the papacy. The German electors repudiated any further interference
of the popes in the election of their kings and emperors. In 1372 the
abbots of the arch-</p>

<p>diocese of Cologne, in refusing the tithe to Pope Gregory XI,
publicly proclaimed that “the Apostolic See has fallen into such
contempt that the Catholic faith in these parts seems to be seriously
imperiled. The laity speak slightingly of the Church because, departing
from the custom of former days, she hardly ever sends forth preachers or
reformers, but rather ostentatious men, cunning, selfish, and greedy.
Things have come to such a pass that few are Christians in more than
name.” 15</p>
<p>It was the Babylonian Captivity of the popes in Avignon, and the en-
suing Papal Schism, that prepared the Reformation; and it was their
return to Italy that restored their prestige and deferred catastrophe
for a century.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE ROAD TO ROME</li>
</ol>
<p>The status of the Church was lowest in Italy. In 1342 Benedict
XII,</p>
<p>to weaken the rebellious Louis of Bavaria, confirmed to all the
despots of the Lombard cities the authority they had assumed in defiance
of Imperial claims; Louis, in revenge, gave the Imperial sanction to the
despots who had seized the Papal States. 16 Milan openly flouted the
popes. When Urban V sent two legates to Milan (1362), bearing bulls of
excommuni- cation to the Visconti, Bernabo compelled them to eat the
bulls — parch- ment, silken cords, and leaden seals. 11 Sicily, ever
since its “Vespers” (1282), had remained in open enmity to the
popes.</p>
<p>Clement VI engaged an army to recapture the Papal States, but it was
his successor, Innocent VI, who for a time restored them to obedience.
Innocent was almost a model pope. After indulging a few relatives with
appointments, he determined to stop the current of nepotism and corrup-
tion. He put an end to the epicurean splendor and wasteful outlay of the
papal court, dismissed the horde of servants that had ministered to
Clem- ent VI, scattered the swarm of place seekers, ordered every priest
to reside in his benefice, and himself led a life of integrity and
modesty. He saw that the authority of the Church could be restored only
by liberating her from the power of France and returning the papacy to
Italy. But a Church alienated from France could hardly maintain herself
without the revenues that had formerly come to her from the Papal
States. Innocent, a man of peace, decided that these could be reclaimed
only by war.</p>
<p>He entrusted the task to a man with the fervent faith of a Spaniard,
the energy of a Dominic, and the chivalry of a Castilian grandee. Gil
Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz had been a soldier under Alfonso XI of
Castile, and had not abandoned war on becoming archbishop of Toledo;
now, as Cardi-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>nal Egidio d’Albornoz, he became a brilliant general. He persuaded
the republic of Florence — which feared the despots and brigands that
sur- rounded her — to advance him the funds to organize an army. By
clever and yet honorable negotiation, rather than by force, he deposed
one after another of the petty tyrants that had seized the Papal States.
He gave to these states the “Egidian Constitutions” (1357) that remained
their basic law till the nineteenth century, and that provided a
workable compromise between self-government and allegiance to the
papacy. He outwitted the famous English adventurer John Hawkwood, took
him prisoner, and threw the fear if not of God at least of the papal
legate into the condottieri. He recovered Bologna from a rebellious
archbishop, and persuaded the Visconti of Milan to make their peace with
the Church. The way was now open for the popes to return to Italy.</p>
<p>Urban V continued the austerity and reforms of Innocent VI. He
la-</p>
<p>bored to restore discipline and honesty in the clergy and at the
papal court, discountenanced luxury among the cardinals, checked the
chicanery of the lawyers and the extortions of the moneylenders,
punished simony, and won to his service men of excellence in character
and mind. He main- tained at his own expense a thousand students in the
universities, founded a new college at Montpellier, and supported many
savants. To crown his pontificate he resolved to restore the papacy to
Rome. The cardinals were horrified at the prospect; most of them had
their roots and affections in France, and were hated in Italy. They
begged him not to heed the pleas of St. Catherine or the eloquence of
Petrarch. Urban pointed out to them the chaotic condition of France —
its king a prisoner in England, its armies shattered, the English
conquering the southern provinces and coming ever nearer to Avignon;
what would a victorious England do to a papacy that had served and
financed France?</p>
<p>So on April 30, 1367, he sailed from Marseille, joyously escorted
by</p>
<p>Italian galleys. On October 16 he entered Rome amid the wild acclaim
of the populace, the clergy, and the aristocracy; Italian princes held
the bridle of the white mule on which he rode; and Petrarch poured out
his gratitude to the French Pope who dared to live in Italy. It was a
desolate though happy Rome: impoverished by its long separation from the
pa- pacy, half of its churches dese rted and decayed, St. Paul’s in
ruins, St. Peter’s threatening at any minute to collapse, the Lateran
palace but re - cently destroyed by fire, palaces rivaling the tenements
in dilapidation, swamps where there had been dwellings, rubbish lying
ungathered in the squares and streets. 18 Urban gave orders and allotted
funds for rebuilding</p>
<p>CHAP. Il) THE POPES IN AVIGNON 59</p>
<p>the papal palace; unable to bear the sight of Rome, he went to live
at Montefiascone; but even there his memories of luxurious Avignon and
be- loved France made him miserable. Petrarch heard of his hesitations,
and urged him to persevere; St. Bridget of Sweden predicted that he
would die soon if he left Italy. The Emperor Charles IV sought to
strengthen him, gave the Imperial sanction to the papal recovery of
central Italy, came humbly to Rome (1368) to lead the Pope’s horse from
Sant’ Angelo to St. Peter’s, served him at Mass, and was crowned by him
in a ceremony that seemed happily to heal the old strife of Empire and
papacy. Then, on September 5, 1 370, perhaps yielding to his French
cardinals, and saying that he wished to make peace between England and
France, Urban embarked for Marseille. On September 27 he reached
Avignon, and there, on De- cember 19, he died, clothed in the habit of a
Benedictine monk, lying on a miserable couch, and having ordered that
all who cared to enter should be admitted, so that all might see how
vain and brief is the splendor of the most exalted man. 19</p>
<p>Gregory XI had been made a cardinal at eighteen by his genial uncle
Clement VI; on December 29, 1370, he was ordained a priest, and on De-
cember 30, aged thirty-nine, he was elected pope. He was a man of learn-
ing, in love with Cicero; fate made him a man of war, and consumed his
pontificate in violent revolt. Urban V, fearing that a French pope could
npt yet trust Italians, had named too many Frenchmen as legates to
govern the Papal States. Finding themselves in a hostile environment,
these prelates had built fortresses against the people, had imported
numerous French aides, had taxed exorbitantly, and had preferred tyranny
to tact. At</p>
<p>Perugia a nephew of the legate pursued a married lady so voraciously
that in trying to escape him she fell from a window and was killed. When
a deputation demanded punishment for the nephew, the legate replied,
“Why all this fuss? Do you mistake a Frenchman for a eunuch?” 20 By a
variety of means the legates earned such hatred that in 1375 many of the
states rose against them in successive revolutions. St. Catherine made
herself the voice of Italy, and urged Gregory to remove these “evil
pastors who poison and devastate the garden of the Church.” 21 Florence,
usually an ally of the papacy, took the lead of the movement, and
unfurled a red flag bearing in golden letters the word Libertas. At the
beginning of 1375 sixty-four cities had acknowledged the pope as their
civic as well as their spiritual head; in 1376 only one remained loyal
to him. It seemed that all the work of Albornoz was undone, and that
central Italy was again lost to the papacy.</p>
<p>Gregory, prodded by the French cardinals, charged the Florentines
with</p>
<p>6o</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>being the head of the revolt, and ordered them to submit to the papal
legates. When they refused he excommunicated them, forbade religious
services in their city, and declared all Florentines to be outlaws,
whose goods might be seized, and whose persons might be enslaved, by any
man anywhere. The whole structure of Florentine commerce and finance was
threatened with collapse. England and France at once laid hands upon the
Florentines and their property there. Florence responded by confiscating
all Church property in its territory, tearing down the buildings of the
Inquisition, closing the ecclesiastical courts, jailing — in some cases
hanging — obstinate priests, and sending an appeal to the people of Rome
to join the revolution, and end all temporal power of the Church in
Italy. While Rome hesitated, Gregory despatched to its leaders a solemn
promise that if the city remained loyal to him he would return the
papacy to Rome. The Romans accepted the pledge, and kept the peace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Pope had sent to Italy a force of “wild Breton merce -
naries” under the command of “the fi erce Cardinal Legate Robert of
Geneva.” 22 Robert waged the war with incredible barbarity. Having taken
Cesena with the promise of an amnesty, he put every man, woman, and
child there to the sword. 23 John Hawkwood, leading his mercenaries in
the service of the Church, slew 4000 in Faenza on suspicion that the
town intended to join the revolt. St. Catherine of Siena was shocked by
these brutalities, by the mutual confiscations, by the cessation of
religious services in so much of Italy. She wrote to Gregory:</p>
<p>You are indeed bound to win back the territory which has been</p>
<p>lost to the Church; but you are even more bound to win back all</p>
<p>the lambs which are the Church’s real treasure, and whose loss
will</p>
<p>truly impoverish her. … You must strike men with the weapons</p>
<p>of goodness, love, and peace, and you will gain more than by the</p>
<p>weapons of war. When I inquire of God what is best for your
salva-</p>
<p>tion, for the restoration of the Church, and for the whole world,</p>
<p>there is no other answer but the word Peace! Peace! For the love</p>
<p>of the Crucified Saviour, Peace! 24</p>
<p>Florence invited her to be one of its envoys to Gregory; she went,
and took the occasion to condemn the morals of Avignon; she was so
outspoken that many called for her arrest, but Gregory protected her.
The mission had no immediate result. But when word reached him that
unless he came soon Rome would join the revolt, Gregory — perhaps moved
also by Catherine’s pleas — set out from Marseille, and reached Rome on
January 17, 1377. He was not unanimously welcomed; the appeal of
Florence had stirred old</p>
<p>THE POPES IN AVIGNON</p>
<p>6 1</p>
<p>CHAP. Il)</p>
<p>republican memories in the degenerate city, and Gregory was warned
that his life was unsafe in the ancient capital of Christendom. In May
he re- tired to Anagni.</p>
<p>And now, as if at last yielding to Catherine, he turned from war
to</p>
<p>diplomacy. His agents encouraged the populace of the cities, who
longed for peace with the Church, to overthrow their rebel governments;
and to all towns that returned to his allegiance he promised
self-government un- der a papal vicar of their own choice. City after
city accepted these terms. In 1377 Florence agreed with Gregory to let
Bernabo Visconti arbitrate their dispute. Bernabo, having persuaded the
Pope to give him half of any penalty he might lay upon Florence, bade
the city pay an indemnity of</p>
<p>800.000 florins (0,000,000) to the Holy See. Deserted by her allies,
Florence angrily submitted; but Pope Urban VI reduced the penalty to</p>
<p>250.000 florins.</p>
<p>Gregory had not lived to see his victory. On November 7, 1377, he re-
turned to Rome. He had been an invalid even in Avignon, and had not
borne well his winter in central Italy. He felt the approach of death,
and feared that the conflict between France and Italy for possession of
the papacy would tear the Church to pieces. On March 19, 1378, he made
ar- rangements for the speedy election of his successor. Eight days
later he died, longing for le beau pays de France.™</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE: 13OO-1424</li>
</ol>
<p>Deferring to a later chapter a consideration of th? faith of the
people and the morals of the clergy, let us note two contrasting
features of Chris- tian life in fourteenth-century Italy: the
Inquisition and the saints. Fairness requires us to remember that the
great majority of Christians then believed that the Church had been
instituted, and that her basic doctrines had been laid down, by the Son
of God; hence — whatever might be the faults of her human personnel —
any active movement to overthrow her was rebellion against divine
authority as well as treason against the secular state of which the
Church was the upholding moral arm. Only with this thought in mind can
we understand tbe ferocity with which Church and laity joined in
suppressing the heresy preached ( c . 1303) by Dolcino of Novara and his
comely sister Margherita.</p>
<p>Like Joachim of Flora, Dolcino divided history into periods, of which
the third, from Pope Sylvester I (314-35) to 1280, saw the gradual
corruption of the Church through worldly wealth; since Sylvesfer (said
Dolcino)</p>
<p>6 2</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. II</p>
<p>all the popes except Celestine V had been unfaithful to Christ;
Benedict, Francis, and Dominic had nobly tried to win the Church back
from Mam- mon to God, but had failed; and the papacy had now, under
Boniface VIII and Clement V, become the harlot of the Apocalypse.
Dolcino made him- self the head of a new fraternity, the “Apostolic
Brethren of Parma,” who rejected the authority of the popes, and
inherited a medley of doctrines from the Patarines, the Waldenses, and
the Spiritual Franciscans. They professed absolute chastity, but each
man among them lived with a woman whom he called his sister. Clement V
ordered the Inquisition to examine them; they refused to appear before
the tribunal; instead they armed them- selves, and took up positions at
the foot of the Piedmontese Alps. The in- quisitors led an army against
them; bloody battles were fought; the Breth- ren retreated into mountain
passes, where they were blockaded and starved; they ate rats, dogs,
hares, grass; at last their mountain stronghold was stormed, a thousand
fell fighting, thousands were burned to death (1304). When Margherita
was led to the stake she was still so beautiful, despite emaciation,
that men of rank offered her marriage if she would abjure her heresies;
she refused, and was slowly consumed. Dolcino and an associate, Longino,
were reserved for special treatment. They were mounted on a cart and
were paraded through Vercelli; during this proces- sion their flesh was
tom from them bit by bit with hot pincers; their limbs and genitals were
wrenched from their bodies; finally they were allowed to die. 26</p>
<p>It is pleasant to turn from such barbarism to the continuing efficacy
of Christianity in inspiring men and women to saintliness. The same
century that saw the tribulations and corruptions of Avignon produced
missionaries like Giovanni da Monte Corvino and Oderic of Pordenone, who
tried to convert the Hindus and Chinese; but the Chinese, says a
Franciscan chron- icler, clung to the “error that any man could be saved
in his own sect.” 27 Unwittingly these missionaries contributed less to
religion than to the science of geography.</p>
<p>St. Catherine of Siena was born, lived, and died in a modest room
still shown to visitors. From that foot of earth she helped to move the
papacy, and to revive in the people of Italy a piety that has survived
Rinascita and Risorgimento alike. At fifteen she joined the Order of
Penance of St. Dominic; this was a “tertiary” organization, composed not
of monks or nuns, but of men and women living a secular life, yet
dedicating them- selves as much as possible to works of religion and
charity. Catherine dwelt with her parents, but she made her room almost
an anchoritic cell,</p>
<p>CHAP. II ) THE POPES IN AVIGNON 63</p>
<p>lost herself in prayer and mystical contemplation, and hardly left
her home except to go to church. Her parents were disturbed by her
preoccupation with religion, and feared for her health. They laid upon
her the heaviest drudgery of the household, which she performed without
complaint. “I make a little corner apart in my heart for Jesus,” she
said , 28 and maintained a childlike serenity. All the joy, doubt, and
ecstasy that other girls might derive from “profane” love Catherine
sought and found in devotion to Christ. In the growing intensity of
these solitary meditations she thought and spoke of Christ as her
heavenly lover, she exchanged hearts with Him, saw herself, in vision,
married to Him; and like St. Francis she thought so long about the five
wounds of the Crucified that it seemed to her that she felt them in her
own hands and feet and side. All temptations of the flesh she rejected
as the wiles of Satan to withdraw her from her one engrossing love.</p>
<p>After three years of almost solitary piety she felt that she could
safely venture into the life of the city. As she had devoted her
womanhood to Christ, so she devoted her maternal tenderness to the sick
and needy of Siena; she stayed to the last moment with the victims of
plague, and stood in spiritual consolation beside condemned criminals
until the hour of their execution . 29 When her parents died and left
her a modest patrimony, she distributed it among the poor. Though she
was disfigured by smallpox, her face was a blessing to all who saw her.
Young men at her word abandoned their wonted blasphemies, and older men
heard with melting skepticism her simple and trusting philosophy. All
the evils of human life, she thought, were the result of human
wickedness; but all the sins of mankind would be swallowed up and lost
in the ocean of God’s love; and all the ills of the world would be cured
if men could be persuaded to practise Christian love. Many believed her;
Montepulciano sent for her to come and reconcile its feuding families;
Pisa and Lucca sought her counsel; Florence invited her to join an
embassy to Avignon. Gradually she was drawn into the world.</p>
<p>She was horrified by what she saw in Italy and France: Rome filthy
and desolate; Italy divorcing itself from a Church that had deserted to
France; a clergy whose worldly living had forfeited the respect of the
laity; a France already half ruined with war. Confident in her divine
mission, she denounced prelates and pontiffs to their faces, and told
them that only a return to Rome and to decency could save the Church.
Herself unable to write, she, a girl of twenty-six, dictated stern but
loving letters, in her simple and melodious Italian, to popes, princes,
and statesmen; and on al- most every page appeared the prophetic word
Riformazione. 30 She failed</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>(chap. II</p>
<p>with the statesmen, but she succeeded with the people. She rejoiced
when Urban V came to Rome, mourned when he left, lived again when</p>
<p>Gregory XI came; she gave good advice to Urban VI, but was shocked by
his brutality; and when the Papal Schism tore Christendom in two she was
among the first casualties of that incredible conflict. She had reduced
her meals to a mere mouthful of food; she carried asceticism so far,
said legend, that the consecrated wafer received by her in communion was
her only nourishment. She lost all power to resist disease; the Schism
broke her will to live; and two years after its outbreak she passed
away, aged thirty- three (1380). To this day she is a force for good in
the Italy that she loved only next to Christ and the Church.</p>
<p>In the year (1380) and city of her death St. Bernardino was bom. The
tradition of Catherine molded him; in the plague of 1400 he gave his
days and nights to caring for the sick. Having joined the Franciscans,
he set the example of obeying the strict rule of the Order. Many monks
followed him; with these he founded ( 1405) the Observantine
Franciscans, or Breth- ren of the Strict Observance; and before he died
three hundred monastic communities had accepted his rule. The purity and
nobility of his life gave an irresistible eloquence to his preaching.
Even in Rome, whose population was more lawless than that of any other
city in Europe, he drew criminals to confession, sinners to repentance,
and habitual feudists to peace. Seventy years before Savonarola’s
Burning of the Vanities in Florence, Bernardino persuaded Roman men and
women to throw their playing cards, dice, lot- tery tickets, false hair,
indecent pictures and books, even their musical in- struments, into a
giant funeral pyre on the Capitol (1424). Three days later a young woman
accused of witchcraft was burned on the same square, and all Rome
crowded to the spectacle. 31 Saint Bernardino himself was “a most
conscientious persecutor of heretics.” 32</p>
<p>So the good and the evil, the beautiful and the horrible, mingled in
the flux and chaos of the Christian life. The simple folk of Italy
remained con- tentedly medieval, while the middle and upper classes,
half drunk with the long-cellared wine of classic culture, moved forward
with a noble ardor to create the Renaissance, and modern man.</p>
