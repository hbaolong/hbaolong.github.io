<h4 id="chapter-iv-gallia-phoenix">CHAPTER IV Gallia Phoenix</h4>
<p>l A-53~ 1 5 1 5</p>
<p>I. louis xi : 1461-83</p>
<p>T HE son of Charles VII was an exceptionally troublesome
dauphift.</p>
<p>Married against his will at thirteeen (1436) to Margaret of Scotland,
aged eleven, he revenged himself by ignoring her and cultivating
mistresses. Margaret, who lived on poetry, found peace in an early death
(1444), say- ing, as she died, “Fie upon life! Speak to me no more of
it.” 1 Louis twice re - belled against his father, fled to Flanders
after the second attempt, and waited fretfully for power. Charles
accommodated him by starving himself to death (1461); 2 and for
twenty-two years France was ruled by one of her strangest and greatest
kings.</p>
<p>He was now thirty-eight, thin and ungainly, homely and melancholy,
with distrustful eyes and far-reaching nose. He looked like a peasant,
dressed like an impoverished pilgrim in a rough gray gown and a shabby
felt hat, prayed like a saint, and ruled as if he had read The Prince
before Machiavelli was born. He scorned the pomp of feudalism, laughed
at traditions and formalities, questioned his own legitimacy, and
shocked all thrones with his simplicity. He lived in the gloomy palace
Des Tournelles in Paris, or in the chateau of Plessis-les-Tours near
Tours, usually like a bachelor, though a second time married; penurious
though possessing France; keeping only the few attendants he had had in
his exile, and eating such food as any peasant might afford. He looked
not an iota, but would be every inch, a king.</p>
<p>He subordinated every element of character to his resolve that France
should under his hammer be forged out of feudal fragmentation into mon-
archic unity and monolithic strength, and that this centralized monarchy
should lift France out of the ashes of war to new life and power. To his
po- litical purpose he gave his thinking day and night, with a mind
clear, cun- ning, inventive, restless, like Caesar counting nothing done
if anything remained to do. “As for peace,” said Comines, “he could
hardly endure th e thought of it.” 8 However, he was unsuccessful in
war, and preferred diplo - macy, espionage, and bribery to force; he
brought men around to his pur- poses by persuasion, flattery, or fear,
and kept a large staff of spies in his service at home and abroad; he
paid regular secret salaries to the ministers</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>of England’s Edward IV. 4 He could yield, bear insult, play at
humility, wait his chance for victory or revenge. He made major
blunders, but recovered from them with unscrupulous and disconcerting
ingenuity. He attended to all deails of government, and forgot nothing.
Yet he spared time for litera- ture and art, read avidly, collected
manuscripts, recognized the revolution that printing presaged, and
enjoyed the company of educated men, particu- larly if they were
Bohemians in the Parisian sense. In his Flanders exile he had joined the
Count of Charolais in forming an academy of scholars, who salted their
pedantry with jolly Boccaccian tales; Antoine de la Salle gath- ered
some of these in the Cent nouvelles nouvelles. He was hard on the rich,
careless of the poor, hostile to artisan guilds, favorable to the middle
class as his strongest support, and in any class ruthless with those who
opposed him. After a rebellion in Perpignan he ordered that any banished
rebel who dared to return should have his testicles amputated. 6 In his
war with the nobles he had some special enemies or traitors imprisoned
for years in iron cages eight by eight by seven feet; these were
contrived by the bishop of Verdun, who later occupied one for fourteen
years. 6 At the same time Louis was much devoted to the Church, needing
her aid against nobles and states. He had a rosary nearly always at
hand, and repeated paternosters and Ave Marias with the assiduity of a
dying nun. In 1472 he inaugurated the Angelus — a midday Ave Maria for
the peace of the realm. He visited sacred shrines, conscripted relics,
bribed the saints to his service, took the Virgin into part- nership in
his wars. When he died, he himself was represented as a saint on an
abbey portal in Tours.</p>
<p>With the help of his faults he created modem France. He found it a
loose association of feudal and ecclesiastical principalities; he made
it a nation, the most powerful in Latin Christendom. He brought in silk
weavers from Italy, miners from Germany; he improved harbors and
transport, protected French shipping, opened new markets to French
industry, and allied the government of France with the rising mercantile
and financial bourgeoisie. He saw that the extension of commerce across
local and national frontiers required a strong central administration.
Feudalism was no longer needed for the protection and management of
agriculture; the peasantry was slowly freeing itself from a stagnant
serfdom; the time had passed when the feudal barons could make their own
laws, mint their own coins, play sovereign in their domains; by fair
means or foul he would bring them, one by one, to submission and order.
He restricted their right to trespass on peasant prop- erties in their
hunts, established a governmental postal service that ran through their
estates (1464), forbade them to wage private wars, and de- manded of
them all the back dues they had failed to pay to their liege lords, the
kings of France.</p>
<p>They did not like him. Representatives of 500 noble families met in
Paris</p>
<p>GALLIA PHOENI</p>
<p>XCHAP. IV)</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>and formed the Ligue du bien public (1464) to uphold their privileges
in the sacred name of the public good. The Count of Charolais, heir to
the throne of Burgundy, joined this League, eager to add northeastern
France to his duchy. Louis’ own brother, C harles, Duke of Berry,
decamped to Brittany and headed the revolt. Enemies and armies rose
against the King on every side. If they could unite he was lost; his
only hope was to defeat them piecemeal. He dashed south across the
Allier River and compelled a hostile force to surrender; he rushed back
north just in time to prevent a Burgundian army from entering his
capital. Each side claimed victory in the battle of Montlhery; the
Burgundians retreated, Louis entered Paris, the Burgundians returned
with allies and laid siege to the city. Unwilling to risk rebellion by
Parisians too intelligent to starve, Louis yielded by the treaty of
Conflans (1465) almost all that his foes demanded — lands, money,
offices; brother Charles received Normandy. Nothing was said about the
public good; the people had to be taxed to raise the required sums.
Louis bided his time.</p>
<p>Charles soon slipped into war with Duke Francis of Brittany, who cap-
tured him; Louis marched into Normandy and regained it bloodlessly. But
Francis, rightly suspecting that Louis wanted Brittany too, joined with
the Count of Charolais — who had now become Duke Charles the Bold of
Bur- gundy — in an offensive alliance against the irrepressible King.
Louis strained every nerve of diplomacy, made a separate peace with
Francis, and agreed to a conference with Charles at Peronne. There, in
effect, Charles took him prisoner, and compelled him to cede Picardy and
share in the sack of Liege. Louis returned to Paris at the nadir of his
power and repute; even the mag- pies were taught to mock him ( 1468).
Two years later, in this reciprocation of treachery, Louis took
advantage of Charles’s preoccupation in Gelder - Iand, and marched his
troops into Saint-Quentin, Amiens, and Beauvais. Charles persuaded
Edward IV to unite with him against France, but Louis bought Edward off.
Knowing Edward’s keen appreciation of women, he invited him to come and
divert himself with the ladies of Paris; moreover, he would assign to
Edward, as royal confessor, the Cardinal of Bourbon, who “would
willingly absolve him if he should commit any sin by way of love or
gallantry.” 7 He maneuvered Charles into war with Switzerland; and when
Charles was killed Louis took not only Picardy but Burgundy itself ( 1
47 7 ). He soothed the Burgundian nobles with gold, and pleased the
people by taking a Burgundian mistress.</p>
<p>Now he felt strong enough to turn upon the barons who had so often
fought him, and had so seldom obeyed his summons to come out and fight
for France. Many of the lords who had conspired against him in 1465 were
dead, or incapacitated by age. Their successors had learned to fear a
king who cut off the heads of traitorous aristocrats and confiscated
their estates.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>who had built a strong army of mercenaries, and seemed always able to
raise immense sums for purchases and bribes. Preferring to spend his
subjects’ money rather than their lives, Louis bought Cerdagne and
Roussillon from Spain. He acquired Rochelle through his brother’s death;
he took Alenfon and Blois by force; he persuaded Rene to bequeath
Provence to the French crown (1481); a year later Anjou and Maine
reverted to the monarchy; in 1483 Flanders, seeking the aid of Louis
against the Holy Roman Empire, ceded to him the county of Artois, with
the thriving cities of Arras and Douai. With the barons subdued, and the
municipal parlements and com- munes submitting to the King, Louis
accomplished for France that na- tional unification and centralized
administration which, a decade later, Henry VII was to achieve for
England, Ferdinand and Isabella for Spain, and Alexander VI for the
Papal States. Though this substituted one tyranny for many, it was at
the time a progressive move, enhancing internal order and external
security, standardizing currency and measurements, molding dialects into
a language, and furthering the growth of vernacular literature in
France. The monarchy was not absolute; the nobles retained large powers,
and the consent of the States-General was usually required for new
taxes. The nobles, the officials, and the clergy were exempt from
taxation: the nobles on the ground that they fought for the people, the
officials because they were so poorly paid and bribed, and the clergy
because they protected king and country with their prayers. Public
opinion and popular customs checked the King; the local parlements still
claimed that no royal edict could become law in their districts until
they had accepted and registered it. Nevertheless the path had been
opened to Louis XIV and L’etat c’est moi.</p>
<p>Amid all these triumphs Louis himself decayed in body and mind. He
imprisoned himself at Plessis-les-Tours, fearing assassination,
suspicious of all, seeing hardly anyone, punishing faults and defections
cruelly, and now and then dressing himself in robes whose magnificence
contrasted with the poor garb of his early reign. He became so gaunt and
pale that those who saw him could hardly believe that he was not already
dead. 8 For years he had suffered agonies from piles, 9 and had had
occasional apoplectic strokes. On August 25, 1483, another attack
deprived him of speech; and five days later he died.</p>
<p>His subjects rejoiced, for he had made them pay unbearably for his
de- feats and victories; the people had grown poorer, as France had
become greater, under his merciless statesmanship. Nevertheless later
ages were to benefit from his subordination of the nobles, his
reorganization of finance, administration, and defense, his promotion of
industry, commerce, and printing, his formation of a modern unified
state. “If,” wrote Comines, “all the days of his life were computed in
which joys and pleasures outweighed his pains and trouble, they would be
found so few that there would be</p>
<p>GALLIA PHOENI</p>

<p>wenty mournful ones to one pleasant.” 10 He and his generation paid
for the future prosperity and splendor of France.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ITALIAN ADVENTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>Charles VIII was thirteen when his father died. For eight years his
sister, Anne de Beaujeu, only ten years his elder, wisely ruled France
as regent. She reduced governmental expenditures, forgave the people a
quarter of the poll tax, recalled many exiles, freed many prisoners, and
successfully resisted the attempt of the barons, in their Guerre Folle
or Foolish War (1485), to re- gain the semi-sovereignty that Louis had
overthrown. When Brittany joined with Orleans, Lorraine, Angouleme,
Orange, and Navarre in a further re- volt, her diplomacy and the
generalship of Louis de la Tremouille defeated them all, and she ended
the turmoil triumphantly by arranging the marriage of Charles to Anne of
Brittany, who brought her great duchy as dowry to the crown of France
(1491). The Regent then retired from the government, and lived her
remaining thirty-one years in peaceful oblivion.</p>
<p>The new queen was quite another Anne. Short, flat, thin, and lame,
with a stubby nose over a spacious mouth on a Gothically elongated face,
she had a mind of her own, as shrewd and parsimonious as any Bretonne’s
should be. Though she dressed simply in black gown and hood, she could,
on occa- sions of state, gleam with jewelry and cloth of gold; and it
was she, rather than Charles, who favored artists and poets, and
commissioned Jean Bourdi- chon to paint Les heures d’Anne de Bretagne.
Never forgetting her beloved Brittany and its ways, she hid her pride in
modesty, sewed industriously, and struggled to reform the morals of her
husband and his court.</p>
<p>Charles, says the gossipy Brantome, “loved women more than his slight
constitution could endure.” 11 After his marriage he restricted himsel f
to one mistress. He could not complain of the Queen’s looks; he himself
was a macrocephalic hunchback, his features homely, his eyes big and
colorless and myopic, his underlip thick and drooping, his speech
hesitant, his hands twitching spasmodically. 12 However, he was
good-natured, kindly, some- times idealistic. He read chivalric
romances, and conceived the notion of re- conquering Naples for France,
and Jerusalem for Christendom. The house of Anjou had held the Kingdom
of Naples (1268-1435) until evicted by Alfonso of Aragon; the claims of
the Anjou dukes had been bequeathed to Louis XI; they were now
proclaimed by Charles. His council thought him the last person in the
world to lead an army in a major war; but they hoped that diplomacy
might ease his way, and that a captured Naples would allow French
commerce to dominate the Mediterranean. To protect the royal flanks they
ceded Artois and Franche-Comte to Maximilian of Austria, and</p>

<p>94</p>
<p>( chap , r:</p>
<p>Cerdagne and Roussillon to Ferdinand of Spain; they thought to get
half of Italy for the parings of France. Heavy taxes, pawned gems, and
loans from Genoese bankers and Lodovico, Regent of Milan, provided an
army of 40,- 000 men, one hundred siege guns, eighty-six ships of
war.</p>
<p>Charles set out gaily ( 1494) , perhaps not loath to leave two Annes
behind. He was welcomed in Milan (which had a score to settle with
Naples), and found its ladies irresistible. He left a trail of natural
children on his march, but handsomely refused to touch a reluctant
maiden who had been con- scripted to his pleasure by his
valet-de-chambre; instead, he sent for her lover, presided over their
betrothal, and gave her a dowry of 500 crowns. 13 Naples had no force
capable of resisting his; he entered it in easy triumph ( 1495), enjoyed
its scenery, cuisine, women, and forgot Jerusalem. He was apparently one
of the lucky Frenchmen who did not contract, in this cam- paign, the
venereal disease that was later called morbus gallicus because it spread
so rapidly in France after the troops’ return. A “Holy Alliance” of
Alexander VI, Venice, and Lodovico of Milan (who had changed his mind)
forced Charles to evacuate Naples and retreat through a hostile Italy.
His reduced army fought an indecisive engagement at Fornovo (1495), and
hastened back to France, carrying with it, among other contagions, the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>It was at Fornovo that Pierre Terrail, Seigneur de Bayard, then
twenty- two, first displayed the courage that earned him half the famous
title of le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche. Born in the Chateau
Bayard in the Dauphine, he came of a noble family every head of which,
for two centuries past, had died in battle; and in this encounter Pierre
seemed bent on continu- ing the tradition. He had two horses killed
under him, captured an enemy standard, and was knighted by his grateful
King. In an age of coarseness, promiscuity, and treachery he maintained
all the virtues of chivalry — mag- nanimous without display, loyal
without servility, honorable without offen- sive pride, and carrying
through a dozen wars a spirit so kindly and gay that contemporaries
called him le bon chevalier. We shall meet him again.</p>
<p>Charles survived his Italian journey by three years. Going to watch a
game of tennis at Amboise, he struck his head against a loosened door,
and died of a cerebral lesion at the age of twenty-eight. As his
children had pre- deceased him, the throne passed to his nephew the Duke
of Orleans, who became Louis XII (1498). Born to Charles of Orleans when
the poet was seventy, Louis was now thirty-six, and already in feeble
health. His morals were abnormally decent for the time, and his manners
were so frank and amiable that France learned to love him despite his
futile wars. He seemed guilty of discourtesy when, in the year of his
accession, he divorced Jeanne de France, daughter of Louis XI; but he
had been forced by that pliantly inflexible king to marry the
unprepossessing girl when he was but eleven</p>
<p>GALLIA PHOENI</p>
<p>Xchap, rv)</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>years old. He could never develop affection for her; and now he
persuaded Alexander VI — in return for a French bride, county, and
pension to the Pope’s son, Caesar Borgia— to annul that marriage on
grounds of consan- guinity, and to sanction his union with the widowed
Anne of Brittany, who carried her duchy in her trousseau. They took up
their abode at Blois, and gave France a royal model of mutual devotion
and loyalty.</p>
<p>Louis XII illustrated the superiority of character to intellect. He
had not the shrewd mind of Louis XI, but he had good will and good
sense, and wit enough to delegate many of his powers to wisely chosen
aides. He left ad- ministration, and most policy, to his lifelong friend
Georges, Cardinal d’Amboise; and this prudent and kindly prelate managed
affairs so well that</p>
<p>It was a pity that this happy reign tarnished its record with further
in- vasions of Italy. Perhaps Louis and other French kings undertook
these sallies to occupy and decimate the quarrelsome nobles who might
otherwise have harassed France with civil war, threatening the still
unstable monarchy and national unity. After twelve years of victory in
Italy, Louis XII had to withdraw his troops from the peninsula, and then
lost to the English at Guinegate (1513) an engagement derisively called
the Battle of the Spurs because the French cavalry fled from the field
in such unwonted haste. Louis made peace, and was content thereafter to
be only King of France.</p>
<p>The death of Anne of Brittany (1514) completed the cycle of his woes.
She had given him no heir, and it was with little pleasure that he
married his daughter Claude to Francis, Count of Angouleme, now next in
line for the throne. His aides urged him, at fifty-two, to take a third
wife and cheat the ebullient Francis by begetting a son. He accepted
Mary Tudor, the six-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>een-year-old sister of Henry VIII. She led the ailing King a merry
and ex- hausting life, insisting on all the attentions due to beauty and
youth. Louis died in the third month of his marriage (1515), leaving to
his son-in-law a defeated but prosperous France that remembered with
affection the Father of the People.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE RISE OF THE CHATEAU</li>
</ol>
<p>XEvery French art but ecclesiastical architecture now felt the
influence of the strengthened monarchy and its Italian forays. Church
building kept to Flamboyant Gothic, declaring its own decadence through
extravagant dec- oration and prodigal detail, but dying like an operatic
courtesan with all the fascination of feminine delicacy, adornment, and
grace. Even so, some splen- did churches were begun in this age:
St. Wulfram at Abbeville, St. Etienne du Mont at Paris, and the perfect
little shrine raised at Brou by Margaret of Austria to the memory of her
husband Philibert II of Savoy. Old struc- tures received new charms.
Rouen Cathedral called its north portal the Portail des Libraires from
the bookstalls that stood in the court; money con- tributed for
indulgences to eat butter in Lent financed the lovely south tower, which
French humor therefore named the T our de Beurre; and Car- dinal
d’Amboise found funds for the west front in the same Flamboyant style.
Beauvais gave its unfinished masterpiece a south transept whose portal
and rose window excel most main facades; Senlis, Tours, and Troyes im-
proved their fanes; and at Chartres Jean le Texier built a luxuriant
northwest steeple and a gorgeous choir screen that showed Renaissance
ideas imping- ing upon Gothic lines. At Paris the exquisite Tour
St. Jacques is the restored survivor of a church raised in this period
to St. James the Greater.</p>
<p>Noble civic buildings redeemed the strife and chaos of the age.
Stately city halls rose in Arras, Douai, Saint-Omer, Noyon,
Saint-Quentin, Com- piegne, Dreux, Evreux, Orleans, Saumur. Grenoble
built a Palais de Justice in 1505, Rouen a still more resplendent one in
1493; Robert Ango and Rol- land Leroux designed it in ornate Gothic, the
nineteenth century redeco- rated it, the second World War gutted it.</p>
<p>This was the first century of the French chateaux. The Church had
been made subject to the state; the enjoyment of this world encroached
upon preparation for the next; the kings would themselves be gods, and
make for their leisure a Mohammedan paradise along the Loire. Between
1490 and 1530 the chdteau fort or castle changed into the chdteau de
plaisance. Charles VIII, returning from his Neapolitan campaign,
demanded of his architects a palace as splendid as those that he had
seen in Italy. He brought back with him the architect Fra Giovanni
Giocondo, the sculptor and painter Guido</p>

<p>The style offended patriots and purists by wedding Gothic towers to
Renaissance palaces, and by replacing Flamboyant decoration with
classical forms and details. The walls, the cylindrical towers, the
high, sloping roofs, the machicolated battlements, the occasional moats,
were still medieval, re- calling the time when a man’s home had to be
his castle and his fort; but the new spirit brought the dwelling out of
its massive martial shell, broadened the windows in rectilinear line to
let in the sun, beautified them with fraines of carved stone, adorned
the interior with classical pilasters, moldings, medal- lions, statues,
arabesques, and reliefs, and surrounded the building with gardens,
fountains, flowers, and, usually, a hunting wood or a smiling plain. In
these amazing homes of luxury, darkness gave place to light, medieval
fear and gloom to Renaissance confidence, audacity, and joy. The love of
life became an architectural style.</p>
<p>We should credit this first age of the chateaux unduly if we assigned
to it either their origin or their full development. Many of them had
pre-existed as castles, and were merely modified; the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries perfected the form to an aristocratic elegance,
the eighteenth changed the mood and replaced the gay lyric of the
chateaux with the grandiose epic of Versailles. Chinon’s cast le-chateau
was already old when Charles VII re- ceived Joan there (1429), and
Loches had had a long history as a royal residence and jail when
Lodovico il Moro came there as a prisoner (1504) after Louis XII’s
second capture of Milan. About 1460 Jean Bo urre, state minister to
Louis XI, restored the thirteenth-century castle of Langeais into a form
essentially medieval — though it is still one of the best preserved of
the chateaux. At Chaumont, toward 1473, Charles d’ Amboise built another
chateau in the medieval manner; and at Gaillon his brother the Cardinal
raised an immense castle-chateau (1497-1510), which the Revolution in-
continently destroyed. Dunois, noble “bastard of Orleans,” restored the
chateau of Chateaudun (1464), and the Cardinal of Orleans-Longueville
gave it a new wing in the Gothic-Renaissance compromise. The chateau of
Blois still contains thirteenth-century portions; Louis XII built for it
an east wing in a harmonious union of brick and stone, of Gothic portal
and Renaissance windows; but its supreme glory awaited Francis I.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>Gothic sculpture made its exit with infinite grace in the exquisitely
carved decoration of the tombs and retable in the church at Brou, where
the figure of the Sibyl Agrippa is as fair a form as any at Chartres or
Reims. But meanwhile Italian artists were remolding French sculpture to
Renais- sance independence, symmetry, and grace. Intercourse between
France and Italy was growing through the visits of ecclesiastics,
diplomats, merchants, and trav- elers; imported Italian objects of art,
especially small bronzes, served as envoys of Renaissance and classical
forms and taste. With Charles VIII and Georges and Charles d’Amboise the
movement became an im petuous stream. It was Italian artists who founded
the Italianizing “School of Amboise” at the country capital of the
kings. The tombs of French Royalty in the church of St. Denis are a
monu- mental record of the transition from the somber dignity of Gothic
sculpture to the smooth elegance and joyous decoration of Renaissance
design, proclaiming glory and celebrating beauty even in the triumph of
death.</p>
<p>The transition was personified in Michel Colombe. Bom about 1431, he
was already described in 146 7 as “the supreme sculptor of the French
realm,” long before the French invasion and absorption of Italy. Gallic
sculpture had here- tofore been nearly all in stone; Colombe imported
Genoese marble, and carved it into figures still stern and stiff with
Gothic intensity, but set in frames exuberant with classic ornament. For
the chateau of Gaillon he cut a spacious high relief of St. George and
the Dragon — a lifeless knight on a spirited horse, all enclosed within
columns, moldings, and coping of Renaissance design. In The Virgin of
the Pillar , carved in stone for the church of St. Galmier, Colombe
achieved the full delicacy of the Italian style in the modesty and
tenderness of the features, the smooth lines of the falling hair. And
perhaps it was Colombe who, in old age, chiseled the Easter Sepulcher
(1496) in the priory church at Solesmes.*</p>
<p>In painting, France felt the influence of the Netherlands as well as
that of Italy. Nicolas Froment began with an almost Dutch realism in The
Resurrection of Lazarus. But in 1476 he moved from Avignon to
Aix-en-Provence, and painted for Rene of Anjou a triptych, The Burning
Bush , whose central panel, showing the Virgin enthroned, has Italian
qualities in its background, its brunette Ma- donna, its majestic Moses,
its charming angel, its alert hound and trustful sheep; here Italy has
won a complete victory. A like evolution of style marked the work of the
“Master of Moulins”— probably Jean Perreal. He went to Italy with
Charles VIII and again with Louis XII; he returned with half the arts of
the Ren- aissance in his repertoire — miniaturist, muralist,
portraitist, sculptor, and archi- tect. At Nantes he designed — and
Colombe carved — the imposing tomb of Duke Francis II of Brittany; and
at Moulins he commemorated his patrons, Anne and Pierre of Beaujeu, with
the handsome portraits that now hang in the Louvre.</p>
<p>The minor arts did not maintain their late-medieval excellence.
Whereas the Flemish illuminators had long since passed to secular
subjects and earthly scenes, the miniatures of Jean Bourdichon in Les
heures (TAnne de Bretagne (1508) represented a return to medieval
simplicity and piety — the lovely legends of the Virgin and her Child,
the tragedy of Golgotha, the triumph of resurrection, the</p>

<p>XCHAP. IV)</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>stories of the saints; the drawing poor, the backgrounds classical,
the color rich and pure, all in a serene atmosphere of feminine
refinement and sentiment. 19 As if in contrast, the stained glass of the
time adopted a Flemish naturalism at first sight unsuited to windows
bringing transfigured light to cathedral floors; yet the glass painted
in this period for Auch, Rouen, and Beauvais catches some of the
thirteenth-century glory. Limoges now rekindled its furnaces, which had
been cold for a century, and rivaled Italy and Islam in painting vessels
with trans- lucent enamels. The wood carvers had not lost their skill;
Ruskin thought the choir stalls of Amiens Cathedral the best in France.
20 Colorful tapestries from the end of the fifteenth century caught the
attention of George Sand in the Chateau de Brissac ( 1 847), and became
a treasure of the Musee de Cluny at Paris; and the Musee des Gobelins
has a stirring tapestry {c. 1500) of musicians playing in a garden of
fleurs-de-lis.</p>
<p>All in all, excepting the chateaux, the fifteenth century was a
fallow age in French art. The so il was plowed by soldiers’ feet and
fertilized with war - time blood; but only toward the end of the period
would men have the means and leisure to sow the seeds of the harvest
that Francis I would reap. The self-portrait of Fouquet betrays an age
of humiliation and distress; the miniatures of his pupil Bourdichon
reflect the familial peace of Louis XII’s second marriage, and the
smiling ease of a recovered land. The worst was over for France; the
best was about to come.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this century of strife and chaos produced a major poet
and a major historian. As one result of a national economy and a
centralized govern- ment, French literature now used the language of
Paris, whether the author came from Brittany, Burgundy, or Provence. As
if to prove that French had matured, Philippe de Comines chose it, not
Latin, for his Memoir es. He took his surname from Comines in Flanders,
where he was born. He came of favored lineage, for Duke Philip V was his
godfather, he was brought up at the Burgundian court, and at seventeen (
1464) he was on the staff of the Count of Charolais. When the Count,
become Charles the Bold, captured Louis XI at Peronne, Comines resented
the behavior of the Duke, perhaps foresaw his fall, and wisely passed to
the serv- ice of the King. Louis made him chamberlain and enriched him
with estates, and Charles VIII sent him on important diplomatic
missions. Meanwhile Comines composed two classics of historical
literature: Memoires , cronique , et hystoire du roy Louis onziesme ,
and Cronique du roi Charles huytiesme — nzxrzxivzs written in clear and
simple French by a man who knew the world and had shared in the events
that he described.</p>
<p>These books instance the extraordinary wealth of French literature in
mem- oirs. They have their faults: they spend themselves mostly upon
war; they are not as fresh and vivid as Froissart or Villehardouin or
JoinviUe: they make too</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>many curtsies to God while admiring the unscrupulous statecraft of
Louis XI; and more often than not the discursive digressions are pits of
platitudes. None the less Comines is the first modern philosophical
historian: he seeks the relations of cause and effect, analyzes
character, motives, and pretenses, judges conduct objectively, and
studies events and original documents to illuminate the nature of man
and the state. In these regards he anticipates Machiavelli and
Guicciardini, and in his pessimistic estimate of mankind:</p>
<p>Neither natural reason, nor our own knowledge, nor love of our</p>
<p>neighbor, nor anything else is always sufficient to restrain us from
do- ing violence to one another, or to withhold us from retaining what
we already have, or to deter us from usurping the possessions of others
by all possible means Wicked men grow the worse for their knowl-</p>
<p>edge, but the good improve extremely. 21</p>
<p>Like Machiavelli, he hopes that his book will teach princes a trick
or two:</p>
<p>Perhaps inferior persons will not give themselves the trouble to read
these memoirs, but princes… may do it, and find some information</p>
<p>o reward their pains For though neither enemies nor princes are</p>
<p>always alike, yet, their affairs being often the same, it is not
altogether unprofitable to be informed of what is past…. One of the
greatest</p>
<p>means to make a man wise is to have studied histories… and to have
learned to frame and proportion our counsels and undertakings ac-</p>
<p>cording to the model and example of our predecessors. For our life is
but of short duration, and insufficient to give us experience of so many
things. 22</p>
<p>The Emperor Charles V, the wisest Christian ruler of his age, agreed
with Co- mines, and called the Memoires his breviary.</p>
<p>The general public preferred romances, farces, and satires. In 1508
appeared the French version of Amadis de Gaule. A dozen companies of
players continued to present misfires, moralities, farces, and soties —
follies that made fun of every- body, including priests and kings.
Pierre Gringore was a master of this form, writing and acting soties
with verve and success through a generation. The most enduring farce in
French literature, Maistre Pierre Pathelin, was first played about 1464,
and as late as 187 2. 23 Pathelin is a poor lawyer starving for cases.
He persuades a draper to sell him six ells of cloth, and invites him to
dinner that evening to receive payment. When the draper comes, Pathelin
is in bed raving with pretended fever, and professes to know nothing
about the ells or the dinner. The draper leaves in disgust, meets the
shepherd of his flock, accuses him of secretly disposing of several
sheep, and hails him before a judge. The shepherd seeks a cheap lawyer
and finds Pathelin, who coaches him to play the idiot and to answer all
questions with the baa (French be) of the sheep. The judge, baffled with
baas, a nd confused by the draper’s mingling of complaints against both
the shepherd and the lawyer, gives France a famous phrase by begging all
parties, Revenons a ces moutons —“het us come back to these sheep”; 24
and finally, in</p>
<p>CHAP. IV ) GALLIA PHOENIX IOl</p>
<p>despair of getting any logic out of the fracas, dismisses the case.
The triumphant Pathelin asks for his fee, but the shepherd only answers
“Baa,” and the clever</p>
<p>The one unforgettable figure in the French literature of the
fifteenth cen- tury is Fran 50 is Villon. He lied, stole, cheated,
fornicated, and killed like the kings and nobles of his time, but with
more rhyme and reason. He was so poor that he could not call even his
name his own. Bom Francois de Montcorbier (1431), reared in plague and
misery in Paris, and adopted by a kindly priest, Guillaume de Villon, he
took his foster- father’s name, dis - graced it, and gave it
immortality. Guillaume put up with the lad’s pranks and truancies,
financed his studies at the university, and took proud comfort when
Francois received the degree of master of arts (1452). For three years
thereafter Guillaume provided him with bed and board in the cloisters of
St. Benoit, waiting for the master to mature.</p>
<p>It must have saddened the hearts of Guillaume and Frangois’ mother to
see him turning from piety to poetry, from theology to burglary. Paris
was rich in rakes, trulls, quacks, sneak thieves, beggars, bullies,
procurers, and drunks, and the reckless youth made friends in almost
every category; for a while he served as a pimp. 25 Perhaps he had
received too much religion, and found a cloister cloying; it is
especially difficult for a clergyman’s son to enjoy the Ten
Commandments. On June 5, 1455, a priest, Philippe Cher- moye, started a
quarrel with him (says Frangois), and cut his lip with a knife,
whereupon Villon gashed him so deeply in the groin that within the week
Philippe was dead. A hero among his comrades, an outlaw hunted by the
police, the poet fled from Paris and for almost a year hid in the
country- side.</p>
<p>He returned “shrunk and wan,” sharp of features and dry of skin,
keeping an eye out for the gendarmes, picking a lock or a pocket now and
then, and hungering for food and love. He became enamored of a bourgeois
lass, who bore with him till she could find a better cavalier, who beat
him; he loved her the more, but commemorated her later as “ ma
damoyselle cm nez tortu”— “my lady of the twisted nose.” About this time
( 1456) he comp osed Le petit testament, the shorter of his poetic
wills; for he had many debts and in- juries to repay, and could never
tell when he might close his life with a noose. He scolds his love for
the parsimony of her flesh, sends his hose to Robert Vallee, to “clothe
his mistress more decently,” and bequeaths to Pernet Marchand “three
sheaves of straw or hay, upon the naked floor to lay, and so the amorous
game to play.” He devises to his barber “the ends</p>
<p>102 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>and clippings of my hair”; and leaves his heart, “piteous, pale, and
numb and dead,” to her who had “so dourly banished me her sight.” 26</p>
<p>After disposing of all this wealth he seems to have lacked bread. On
Christ- mas Eve, 1456, he joined three others in robbing the College of
Navarre of some 500 crowns (2,500?). Buttressed with his share, Frangois
resumed his stay in the country. For a year he disappears from historic
sight; then, in the winter of 1457, we find him among the poets
entertained at Blois by Charles of Orleans. Villon took part in a poetic
tournament there, and must have pleased, for Charles kept him through
some weeks as his guest, and replenished the youth’s leaking purse. Then
some prank or quarrel cooled their friendship, and Frangois returned to
the road, versifying an apology. He wandered south to Bourges, exchanged
a poem for a present with Duke John II of Bourbon, and rambled as far as
Roussillon. We picture him, from his poetry, as living on gifts and
loans, on fruit and nuts and hens plucked from roadside farms, talking
with peasant girls and tavern tarts, singing or whistling on the
highways, dodging the police in the towns. Again we lose track of him;
then, suddenly, he reappears, condemned to death in a prison at Orleans
(1460).</p>
<p>We do not know what brought him to that pass; we know only that in
July of that year Marie of Orleans, daughter of the poet duke, made a
formal entry into the city, and that Charles celebrated the occasion
with a general amnesty to prisoners. Villon emerged from death to life
in an ecstasy of joy. Soon hungry, he stole again, was caught, and — his
previous escapades being held against him — was thrown into a dark and
dripping dungeon in the village of Meung-sur-Loire, near Orleans. Four
months he lived there with rats and toads, biting his scarred lip, and
vowing vengeance on a world that punished thieves and let poets starve.
But not all the world was unkind. Louis XI, passing through Orleans,
declared another amnesty, and Villon, told that he was free, danced a
fandango on his prison straw. He rushed back to Paris or its vicinity;
and now, old and bald and penniless at thirty, he wrote his greatest
poems, which he called simply Les Lais (The Lays); posterity, finding so
many of them cast again into the form of ironic bequests, termed them Le
grand testament (1461-62).</p>
<p>He leaves his spectacles to the hospital for blind paupers, so that
they may, if they can, distinguish the good from the bad, the lowly from
the great, among the skeletons in the charnel house of the Innocents. So
soon in life obsessed with death, he mourns the mortality of beauty, and
sings a Ballade des dames du temps jadis —of yesterday’s belles:</p>
<p>Dictes moy ou , n’en quel pays,</p>
<p>Est Flora la belle Romaine,</p>
<p>Archipiades, ne Thais ,</p>
<p>Qui jut sa cousine germaine,</p>

<p>He considers it nature’s unforgivable sin to ravish us with
loveliness and then dissolve it in our arms. His bitterest poem is Les
regrets de la belle heaulmiere — xhz lament of the fair helm-maker:</p>
<p>Where is that clear and crystal brow?</p>
<p>Those eyebrows arched, and golden hair?</p>
<p>And those bright eyes, where are they now,</p>
<p>Wherewith the wisest ravished were?</p>
<p>The little nose so straight and fair.</p>
<p>The tiny, tender, perfect ear;</p>
<p>Where is the dimpled chin, and where</p>
<p>The pouting lips so red and clear? 28</p>
<p>The description proceeds from lure to lure, omitting none; and then,
in plain- tive litany, each charm decays:</p>
<p>The breasts all shriveled up and gone,</p>
<p>The haunches, like the paps, withdrawn,</p>
<p>The thighs no longer like to thighs,</p>
<p>Withered and mottled all like brawn —</p>
<p>which here, alas, means sausages (saulcisses).</p>
<p>And so, no longer loving love or life, Villon bequeaths himself to
the dust:</p>
<p>Item, my body I ordain</p>
<p>Unto the earth, our grandmother;</p>
<p>Thereof the worms will have small gain;</p>
<p>Hunger hath worn it many a year.</p>
<p>He leaves his books gratefully to his foster-father; and as a parting
gift to his old mother he composes for her a humble ballad to the
Virgin. He asks mercy of all but those who imprisoned him: of monks and
nuns, mummers and chanters, lackeys and gallants, “wantons who all their
charms display… brawlers and jugglers and tumblers gay, clowns with
their apes and carpets spread… gentle and simple, living and dead — I
cry folk mercy, one and all.” 29 So</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>Here is ended (both great and small)</p>
<p>Poor Villon’s Testament! When he is dead,</p>
<p>Come, I pray you, to his funeral,</p>
<p>Whilst the bell tinkles overhead…</p>
<p>Prince, that art gentle as a yearling gled,</p>
<p>Hear what he did with his latest sigh;</p>
<p>He drank a long draught of the vine-juice red,</p>
<p>Whenas he felt his end draw nigh. 30</p>
<p>Despite these wills and farewells, he could not so soon turn down the
cup of life. In 1462 he went back to Guillaume de Villon and the
cloisters, and his mother rejoiced. But the law had not forgotten him.
The College of Navarre had him arrested, and consented to his liberation
only on condition that he repay it his share of the loot of six years
back — forty crowns a year for three years. On the night of his release
he had the ill luck to be with two of his old crime mates when they
started a drunken brawl in which a priest was stabbed. Apparently Villon
had no blame in the matter; he withdrew to his room, and prayed for
peace. Nevertheless he was again arrested; he was tortured by having
water forced down his throat to the bursting point; and then, to his
astonishment, he was condemned to be hanged. For several weeks he lay in
close confinement, hoping and despairing. And now, expecting death fop
himself and his companions, he indited a pitiful farewell to the
world.</p>
<p>Men, brother men, that after us yet live,</p>
<p>Let not your hearts too hard against us be;</p>

<p>Not yet quite hopeless, Villon persuaded his jailer to take a message
to his foster-father, and to convey to the court of the Parlement an
appeal from a sentence so clearly unjust. Guillaume de Villon, who could
forgive seventy times seven, once more interceded for the poet, who must
have had some virtues to be so undiscourageably loved. On January 3,
1463, the court, say its record, “ordered that… the sentence preceding
be annulled, and — hav- ing regard to the bad character of the said
Villon — that he be banished for ten years from the town… and viscounty
of Paris.” 82 Francois thanked the court in a joyful ballad, and asked
for three days’ grace to “provide for my journey and bid my folk adieu.”
It was granted, and presumably he now saw his foster-father and his
mother for the last time. He packed his bundle, grasped the bottle of
wine and the purse that good Guillaume gave him, re- cei ved the old
man’s benediction, and marched out of Paris and history. We hear nothing
of him more.</p>
<p>He was a thief, but a melodious thief, and the world has need of
melody. He could be brutally coarse, as in the Ballade de la Grosse
Margot, and he flung obscene epithets at women who fell short of his
desires, and he was impishly frank in anatomical details. All this we
can forgive for the sins that were committed against his sins, and the
ever resurgent tenderness of his spirit, and the wistful music of his
verse. He paid the penalty for wnat ne was, and left us only the
reward.</p>
