<p>Feudalism and Chivalry</p>
<p>600-1200</p>
<p>I. FEUDAL ORIGINS</p>
<p>I N the six centuries that followed the death of Justinian, a
remarkable col- laboration of circumstances slowly effected a basic
transformation of economic life in the West European world.</p>
<p>Certain conditions already noted came together to prepare for
feudalism. As the cities of Italy and Gaul became unsafe during the
German invasions, aristocrats moved out to their rural villas, and
surrounded themselves with agricultural dependents, “client” families,
and military aides. Monasteries whose monks tilled the soil and
practiced handicrafts accentuated the cen- trifugal movement toward
half-isolated economic units in the countryside. Roads injured by war,
neglected by poverty, and endangered by highway- men, could no longer
maintain adequate communication and exchange. State revenues declined as
commerce contracted and industry fell; impoverished governments could no
longer provide protection for life, property, and trade. The obstruction
of commerce compelled the villas to seek economic self-sufficiency; many
manufactured articles formerly bought from the cities were — from the
third century onward — produced on the great estates. In the fifth
century the letters of Sidonius Apollinaris show us rural lords living
in luxury on spacious holdings tilled by a semiservile tenantry; they
are already a feudal aristocracy, possessing their own judiciary 1 and
soldiery , 2 and dif- fering from the later barons chiefly in knowing
how to read.</p>
<p>The same factors that paved the way for feudalism between the third
cen- tury and the sixth established it between the sixth and the ninth.
Merovingian and Carolingian kings paid their generals and administrators
with grants of land; in the ninth century these fiefs became hereditary
and semi-independ- ent through the weakness of the Carolingian kings.
The Saracen, Norse, and Magyar invasions of the eighth, ninth, and tenth
centuries repeated and ce- mented the results of the German invasions
six centuries before: central pro- tection failed, the local baron or
bishop organized a localized order and defense, and remained possessed
of his own force and court. Since the in- vaders were often mounted,
defenders who could afford a horse were in de- mand; cavalry became more
important than infantry; and just as in early Rome a class of equites —
men on horseback — had taken form between patri-</p>
<p>FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>cian and plebs, so in France, Norman England, and Christian Spain a
class of mounted knights grew up between the duke or baron and the
peasantry. The people did not resent these developments; in an
atmosphere of terror, when attack might come at any time, they craved
military organization; they built</p>
<p>their homes as near to the baronial castle or fortified monastery as
they could; and they readily gave allegiance and service to a lord —
i.e., a law-ward — or to a duke — i.e., one who could lead; we must
imagine their terror to understand their subjection. Freemen who could
no longer protect themselves offered their land or labor to“ some strong
man in return for shelter and support; in such cases of “commendation”
the baron usually assigned to “his man” a tract</p>
<p>It cannot be rigidly defined, for it had a hundred variations in time
and place. Its origins lay in Italy and Germany, but its most
characteristic devel- opment came in France. In Britain it may have
begun as the enserfment of Britons by Anglo-Saxon conquerors , 3 but for
the most part it was there a Gallic importation from Normandy. It never
matured in northern Italy or Christian Spain; and in the Eastern Empire
the great landowners never devel- oped military or judicial
independence, nor that hierarchy of fealties which seemed in the West
essential to feudalism. Large sectors of Europe’s peas - antry remained
unfeudalized: the shepherds and ranchers of the Balkans, eastern Italy,
Spain; the vine growers of western Germany and southern France; the
sturdy farmers of Sweden and Norway; the Teutonic pioneers beyond the
Elbe; the mountaineers of the Carpathians, the Alps, the Apen- nines,
and the Pyrenees. It was not to be expected that a continent so physi-
cally and climatically diverse should have a uniform economy. Even
within feudalism conditions of contract and status varied from nation to
nation, from manor to manor, from time to time. Our analysis will apply
chiefly to the France and England of the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>FEUDAL ORGANIZATION</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Slave</li>
</ol>
<p>In those lands and times society consisted of freemen, serfs, and
slaves. Freemen included nobles, clerics, professional soldiers,
practitioners of the professions, most merchants and artisans, and
peasants who owned their land with little or no obligation to any feudal
lord, or leased it from a lord for a money rent. Such peasant
proprietors constituted some four per cent of the farming population of
England in the eleventh century; they were more nu- merous in western
Germany, northern Italy, and southern France; they</p>
<p>554 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>probably constituted a quarter of the total peasant population in
Western Europe. 4</p>
<p>Slavery diminished as serfdom increased. In twelfth-century England
it was mostly confined to household service; in France north of the
Loire it was negligible; in Germany it rose in the tenth century, when
no compunction was felt in capturing pagan Slavs for menial tasks on
German estates, or for sale in Moslem or Byzantine lands. Conversely,
Moslems and Greeks were kidnaped by slave traders along the shores of
the Black Sea, western Asia, or northern Africa for sale as farm hands,
domestic servants, eunuchs, concu- bines, or prostitutes in Islam or
Christendom. 5 The slave trade flourished es- pecially in Italy,
probably due to the nearness of Moslem countries, which could be preyed
upon with a good conscience; it seemed a fair revenge for Saracen
raids.</p>
<p>An institution that had lasted throughout known history appeared
inevi- table and eternal, even to honest moralists. It is true that Pope
Gregory I freed two of his slaves with admirable words about the natural
liberty of all men; 6 but he continued to use hundreds of slaves on the
papal estates, 7 and approved laws forbidding slaves to become clerics
or marry free Christians. 8 The Church denounced the sale of Christian
captives to Moslems, but permitted the enslavement of Moslems and of
Europeans not yet converted to Christi- anity. Thousands of captured
Slavs and Saracens were distributed among monasteries as slaves; and
slavery on church lands and papal estates continued till the eleventh
century. 9 Canon law sometimes estimated the wealth of church lands in
slaves rather than in money; like secular law, it considered the slave
as a chattel; it forbade church slaves to make wills, and decreed that
any peculium or savings of which they died possessed should belong to
the Church. 10 The archbishop of Narbonne, in his will of 1 149, left
his Saracen slaves to the bishop of Beziers. 11 St. Thomas Aquinas
interpreted slavery as one consequence of Adam’s sin, and as economic
ally expedient in a world where some must toil in order that others may
be free to defend them. 12 Such views were in the tradition of
Aristotle, and in the spirit of the times. The rule of the Church, that
her property should never be alienated except at its full market value,
13 was unfortunate for her slaves and serfs; emancipation sometimes
proved more difficult on ecclesiastical than on secular properties. 14
Nevertheless the Church progressively restricted the slave traffic by
forbid- ding the enslavement of Christians at a time when Christianity
was spread- ing rapidly.</p>
<p>The decline of slavery was due not to moral progress but to economic
change. Production under direct physical compulsion proved less
profitable or convenient than production under the stimulus of
acquisitive desire. Ser- vitude continued, and the word serv’us served
for both slave and serf; but in time it became the word serf , as
villein became villain, and Slav became slave . It was the serf, not the
slave, who made the bread of the medieval world.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>2 . The Serf</p>
<p>Typically the serf tilled a plot of land owned by a lord or baron who
gave him a life tenure and military protection as long as he paid an
annual rent in pro ducts, labor, or money. He could be evicted at the
owner’s will; 15 and at</p>
<p>The feudal dues of the serf to the owner of his land were numerous
and diverse; some intelligence must have been required even to remember
them. ( 1 ) He paid annually three taxes in money: (a) a small head tax,
to the gov- ernment but through the baron; (b) a small rent ( cens );
(c) an arbitrary charge ( faille ) levied by the owner yearly or
oftener. (2) He annually gave the lord a share — usually a dime or tenth
— of his crops and livestock. (3) He owed his lord many days of unpaid
labor ( corvee ); this was an inheritance from older economies, in which
tasks like clearing woods, draining marshes, digging canals, raising
dykes, were performed by the peasants collectively as an obligation to
the community or king. Some lords required three days weekly through
most of the year, four or five days a week in plowing or harvest time;
additional labor days, paid only by meals, might be exacted in
emergencies. This obligation of corvee lay upon only one male in each
house- hold. (4) The serf was obliged to grind his corn, bake his bread,
brew his beer, press his grapes, at the lord’s mill, oven, vat, or
press, and pay a small fee for each such use. (5) He paid a fee for the
right to fish, hunt, or pasture his animals, on the lord’s domain. (6)
His actions at law had to be brought before the baronial court, and cost
him a fee varying with the gravity of the case. (7) He had to serve at
call in the baron’s reg iment in war. (8) If the baron was captured, the
serf was expected to contribute to the ransom. (9) He contributed also
to the substantial gift due to the lord’s son on being made a knight.
(10) He paid the baron a tax on all products that he took for sale to
market or fair. ( 1 1 ) He could not sell his beer or wine until the
lord had had two weeks’ prior time to sell the lord’s beer or wine. (12)
In many cases he was obliged to buy a prescribed quantity of wine yearly
from his lord; if he did not buy in time, says one customal (a
collection of the laws of a manor), “then the lord shall pour a four -
gallon measure over the man’s roof; if the wine runs down, the tenant
must pay for it; if it runs upward, he shall pay nothing.” 16 (13) He
paid a fine if he sent a son to higher education or gave him to the
Church, for thereby the manor lost a hand. (14) He paid a tax,</p>
<p>55&lt;$ the age of faith (chap. xxii</p>
<p>and required the lord’s consent, in case he or his children married a
person not belonging to his manor, for then the lord would lose some or
all of the offspring; on many estates permission and fee were required
for any marriage at all. (15) In scattered instances 17 we hear of the
ius primae noctis or droit du seigneur, whereby the lord might claim the
“right of the first night” with the serf’s bride; but in almost all
cases the serf was allowed to “redeem” his bride by paying a fee to the
lord; 18 in this form the ius primae noctis survived in Bavaria till the
eighteenth century. 19 On some English estates the lord fined the
peasant whose daughter had sinned; on some Spanish estates a peas- ant
wife convicted of adultery forfeited part or all of her belongings to
the lord. 20 (16) If the peasant died without issue residing with him,
the house and land reverted to the lord by escheat. If his heir was an
unmarried daugh- ter, she could retain the holding only by marrying a
man living on the same manor. In any event, as a kind of inheritance
tax, the lord, on the death of a serf tenant, was entitled to take an
animal, or an article of furniture or cloth- ing, from the holding; in
some cases the parish priest took a similar mortu- arium-, 21 in France
these death dues were exacted only when the serf died without a
codomiciled heir. (17) On some — especially on ecclesiastical- manors he
paid an annual and an inheritance tax to the Vogt who provided military
defense for the estate. To the Church the peasant paid an annual tithe
or tenth of his produce.</p>
<p>From so varied an assortment of dues — never all exacted from one
family — it is impossible to calculate the total of a serf’s
obligations. For late medieval Germany it has been reckoned at two
thirds of his produce. 2111 The power of custom, pre-eminent in
agricultural regimes, favored the serf: usually his dues in money and
kind tended to remain the same through centuries, 22 de- spite rising
production and depreciated currencies. Many disabilities or obli-
gations that lay on the serf in theory or law were softened or annulled
by baronial indulgence, effective resistance, or the erosion of time. 23
Perhaps in general the misery of the medieval serf has been exaggerated;
the dues exacted of him were largely in lieu of a money rent to the
owner, and taxes to the community, to maintain public services and
public works; probably they bore a smaller proportion to his income than
our federal, state, county, and school taxes bear to our income today.
24 The average peasant of the twelfth century was at least as well off
as some sharecroppers in modem states, and better off than a Roman
proletaire in Augustus’ reign. 25 The baron did not consider himself an
exploiter; he functioned actively on the manor, and sel- dom enjoyed
great wealth. The peasants, till the thirteenth century, looked up to
him with admiration, often with affection; if the lord became a
childless widower they sent deputations to him to urge remarriage, lest
the estate be left without a regular heir, and be despoiled in a war of
succession. 26 Like most economic and political systems in history,
feudalism was what it had to be to meet the necessities of place and
time and the nature of man.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 557</p>
<p>The peasant’s cottage was of fragile wood, usually thatched with
straw</p>
<p>Dressed in a blouse of cloth or skins, a jacket of leather or wool,
belt and trousers, high shoes or boots, the peasant must have made a
sturdy figure, not much different from the peasant of France today; we
must picture him not as an oppressed and beaten man, but as a strong and
patient hero of the plow, sustained, as every man is, by some secret,
however irrational, pride. His wife worked as hard as himself, from dawn
to dark. In addition she supplied him with children; and since children
were assets on the farm, she bore them abundantly; nevertheless we read
in the Franciscan Pelagius ( c . 1330) how some peasants “often abstain
from their wives, lest childr en be born, fearing, under pretext of
poverty, that they cannot bring up so many.” 28</p>
<p>The food of the peasant was substantial and wholesome — dairy
products, eggs, vegetables, and meat; but genteel historians mourn that
he had to eat black — i.e., whole grain — bread. 29 He shared in the
social life of the village, but had no cultural interests. He could not
read; a literate serf would have been an offense to his illiterate lord.
He was ignorant of everything but farm- ing, and not too skilled in
that. His manners were rough and hearty, perhaps gross; in this turmoil
of European history he had to survive by being a good animal, and he
managed it. He was greedy because poor, cruel because fear- ful, violent
because repressed, churlish because treated as a churl. He was the
mainstay of the Church, but he had more superstition than religion.
Pelagius charged him with cheating the Church of her tithes, and
neglecting to ob- serve the holydays and the fasts; Gautier de Coincy
(thirteenth century) compla ined that the serf “has no more fear of God
than a sheep, does not give a button for the laws of Holy Church.” 30 He
had his moments of heavy, earthy humor, but in the fields and in his
home he was a man of spare speech, straitened vocabulary, and solemn
mood, too consumed by toil and chores to waste his energy on words or
dreams. Despite his superstitions he was a re-</p>

<p>558</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>alist; he knew the merciless whims of the sky, and the certainty of
death; one season of drouth could bring him and his brood to starvation.
Sixty times be- tween 970 and 1 100 famine mowed men down in France; no
British peasant could forget the famines of 1086 and 1125m Merrie
England; and the bishop of Trier in the twelfth century was shocked to
see starving peasants kill and eat his horse. 31 Flood and plague and
earthquake entered the play, and made every comedy a tragedy at
last.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Village Community</li>
</ol>
<p>Around the baronial villa some fifty to five hundred peasants —
serfs, half free, or free — built their village, living not in isolated
homesteads but, for safety’s sake, close together within the walls of
the settlement. Usually the village was part of one or more manors; most
of its officials were appointed by the baron, and were responsible only
to him; but the peasants chose a reeve or provost to mediate between
them and the lord, and to co-ordinate their agricultural activity. In
the market place they gathered periodically to barter goods in the
residuum of trade that survived the economic self-contain- ment of the
manor. The village rural household raised its own vegetables and some of
its meat, spun its wool or linen, made most of its clothing. The village
blacksmith hammered out iron tools, the tanner made leather goods, the
car- penter built cottages and furniture, the wheelwright made carts;
fullers, dyers, masons, saddlers, cobblers, soapmakers . . . lived in
the village or came there transiently to ply their crafts on demand; and
a public butcher or baker competed with the peasant and the housewife in
preparing meat and bread.</p>
<p>Nine tenths of the feudal economy were agricultural. Normally, in</p>
<p>eleventh-century France and England, the cultivated land of the manor
was yearly divided into three fields; one was planted to wheat or rye,
one to barley or oats, one was left fallow. Each field was subdivided
into acre or half- acre strips, separated by “balks” of unplowed turf.
The village officials assigned to each peasant a variable number of
strips in each field, and bound him to rotate his crops in accord with a
plan fixed by the community. The whole field was plowed, harrowed,
planted, cultivated, and harvested by the joint labor of all. The
scattering of one man’s strips among three or more fields may have aimed
to give him a fair share of unequally productive lands; and the
co-operative tillage may have been a survival from a primitive com-
munism of which scant trace remains. In addition to these strips each
peasant fulfilling his feudal dues had the right to cut timber, pasture
his cattle, and gather hay in the manorial woods, common, or “green.”
And usually he had enough land around his cottage for a garden and
fiowers.</p>
<p>Agricultural science in feudal Christendom could hardly compare with
that of C olumella’s Romans, or of Moslem Mesopotamia or Spain.
Stubble</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 559</p>
<p>and other refuse were burned on the fields to fertilize the soil and
rid it of insects and weeds; marl or other limy earths provided a crude
manure; there were no artificial fertilizers, and the costs of transport
limited the use of ani - mal dung; the archbishop of Rouen emptied the
offal of his stables into the Seine instead of carting it to his fields
in nearby Deville. Peasants pooled their pence to buy a plow or harrow
for their common use. Till the eleventh cen- tury the ox was the draft
animal; he ate less expensively, and in old age could be eaten more
profitably than the horse. But about 1000 the harness makers invented
the stiff collar that would allow a horse to draw a load without
choking; so dressed, the horse could plow three or four times as much in
a day as the ox; in wet temperate climates speed of plowing was
important; so during the eleventh century the horse more and more
replaced the ox, and lost his high status as reserved for travel,
hunting, and war . 32 Water mills, long known to the Moslem East,
entered Western Europe toward the end of the twelfth century . 33</p>
<p>The Church eased the toil of the peasant with Sundays and holydays,
on which it was a sin to do “servile work.” “Our oxen,” said the
peasants, “know when Sunday comes, and will not work on that day.” 34 On
such days, after Mass, the peasant sang and danced, and forgot in hearty
rustic laughter the dour burden of sermon and farm. Ale was cheap,
speech was free and pro- fane, and loose tales of womankind mingled with
awesome legends of the saints. Rough games of football, hockey,
wrestling, and weight throwing pitted man against man, village against
village. Cockfighting and bullbaiting flourished; and hilarity reached
its height when, within a closed circle, two blindfolded men, armed with
cudgels, tried to kill a goose or a pig. Some- times, of an evening,
peasants visited one another, played indoor games, and drank; usually,
however, they stayed at home, for no streets were lit; and at home,
since candles were dear, they went to bed soon after dark. In the long
nights of the winter the family welcomed the cattle into the cottage,
thank- ful for their heat.</p>
<p>So, by hard labor and mute courage, rather than by the initiatives
and skills that proper incentives breed, the peasants of Europe fed
themselves and their masters, their soldiers and clergy and kings. They
drained marshes, raised dykes, cleared woods and canals, cut roads,
built homes, advanced the fron- tier of cultivation, and won the battle
between jungle and man. Modern Europe is their creation. Looking now at
these neat hedges and ordered fields, we cannot see the centuries of
toil and tribulation, breaking back and heart, that beat the raw
materials of reluctantly bountiful nature into the economic foundations
of our life. Women, too, were soldiers in that war; it was their patient
fertility that conquered the earth. Monks fought for a time as bravely
as any; planted their monasteries as outposts in the wilds, forged an
economy out of chaos, and begot villages in the wilderness. At the
begin- ning of the Middle Ages the greater part of Europe’s soil was

<p>unpeopled forest and waste; at their end the Continent had been won
for civilization. Perhaps, in proper perspective, this was the greatest
campaign, the noblest victory, the most vital achievement, of the Age of
Faith.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Lord</li>
</ol>
<p>Under every system of economy men who can manage men manage men who
can only manage things. In feudal Europe the manager of men was the
baron — in Latin dominus, in French seigneur (the Roman senior ) , in
German Herr (master), in English lord. His functions were threefold: to
give mili- tary protection to his lands and their inhabitants; to
organize agriculture, in- dustry, and trade on these lands; to serve his
liege lord or his king in war. In an economy reduced to elementals and
fragments by centuries of migration, invasion, rapine, and war, society
could survive only by the local independ- ence and sufficiency of food
supply and soldiery. Those who could organize defense and tillage became
the natural lords of the land. Ownership and man- agement of land became
the source of wealth and power; and an age of landed aristocracy began
that would last till the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>The basic principle of feudalism was mutual fealty: the economic and
mili- tary obligation of serf or vassal to the lord, of lord to suzerain
or superior lord, of suzerain to king, of king to suzerain, of suzerain
to lord, of lord to vassal and serf. In return for the services of his
serfs, the lord gave them land on a life tenure verging on ownership; he
allowed them, for a modest fee, the use of his ovens, presses, mills,
waters, woods, and fields; he commuted many labor dues for small money
payments, and let others lapse in the oblivion of time. He did not
dispossess the serf — usually he took care of him — in helpless sickness
or old age. 38 On feast days he might open his gates to the poor, and
feed all who came. He organized the maintenance of bridges, roads,
canals, and trade; he found markets for the manor’s surplus products,
“hands” for i ts operations, money for its purchases. He brought in good
stock for breeding purposes, and allowed his serfs to service their
flocks with his selected males. He could strike — in some localities or
circumstances he could kill — a serf with impunity; but his sense of
economy controlled his brutality. He exercised judicial as well as
military powers over his domain, and profited unduly from fines levied
in the manorial court; but this court, though often intimidated by his
bailiff, was mostly manned by serfs themselves; and that the rude
justice there decreed was not too oppressive appears from the readi-
ness of the serf to buy indemnity from service in these judicial
assemblies. Any serf who cared and dared could speak his mind in the
manorial court; some dared; and in their piecemeal and unintended way
these tribunals helped to forge the liberties that ended serfdom.</p>
<p>A feudal lord could own more than one manor or estate. In such case
he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 561</p>
<p>appointed a “seneschal” to supervise his “domain”— i.e., all his
manors — and a steward or bailiff for each; and he would move from manor
to manor with his household to consume their products on the spot. He
might have a castle on each of his estates. Descended from the walled
camp ( castrum , castellum) of the Roman legions, from the fortified
villa of the Roman noble, or from the fortress or burg of the German
chieftain, the feudal castle or chateau was built less for comfort than
for security. Its outermost protection was a wide, deep fosse or moat;
the earth thrown up and inward from the moat formed a mound into which
were sunk square posts bound together to form a continu- ous stockade.
Across the moat a cleated drawbridge led up to an iron gate or
portcullis, which protected a massive door in the castle wall. Within
this wall were stables, kitchen, storehouses, outhouses, bakery,
laundry, chapel, and servants’ lodgings, usually all of wood. In war the
tenants of the manor crowded with their cattle and movables into this
enclosure. At its center rose the donjon, the house of the master; in
most cases it was a large square tower, also of wood; by the twelfth
century it was built of stone and took a rounded form as easier for
defense. The lowest story of the donjon was a storehouse and dungeon;
above this dwelt the lord and his family. From these donjons, in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, developed the castles and chateaux of
England, Germany, and France, whose impregnable stones were the military
b asis of the lord’s power against his tenants and the king.</p>
<p>The interior of the donjon was dark and confined. Windows were few
and small, and seldom glazed; usually canvas, oiled paper, shutters, or
lattices kept out most rain and much light; artificial light was
provided by candles or torches. In most cases there was but one room to
each of the three stories. Ladders and trap doors, or winding stairs,
connected the floors. On the second story was the main hall, serving as
the baron’s court of justice , and as dining room, living room, and
bedroom for most of his household. At one end there might be a raised
platform or dais, on which the lord, his family, and his guest ate their
meals; others ate from removable tables placed before benches in the
aisles. At retiring time mattresses were laid upon the floor or upon low
wooden bedsteads in the aisles; all the household slept in this one
room, with screens providing privacy. The walls were whitewashed or
painted; they were adorned with banners, weapons, and armor, and the
room might be pro- tected from drafts by hangings or tapestries. The
floor, paved with tile or stone, was covered with rushes and boughs. In
the middle of the room a kind of central heating was generated by a wood
fire in a hearth. Till the later Middle Ages there was no chimney; smoke
escaped through a louver or “lantern” in the roof. Behind the dais a
door opened into a “solar,” where the lord, his family, and his guest
might take their ease and the sun; furniture was more comfortable there,
with a carpet, a fireplace, and a luxurious bed.</p>
<p>The lord of the manor dressed himself in a tunic, usually of colored
silk, adorned with some geometrical or floral design; a cape covering
the shoul-</p>
<p>l THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>ders, and loose enough to be raised over the head; short drawers and
breeches; stockings that reached up the thighs; and long shoes with toes
curled up like prows. At his belt swung a scabbard and sword; from his
neck usually hung some pendant like a cross. To distinguish one helmeted
and armored knight from another in the First Crusade, 36 European nobles
adopted the Islamic practice 37 of marking their garments, livery,
standards, armor, and equipage with heraldic devices or coats of arms;
henceforth heraldry developed an esoteric jargon intelligible only to
heralds and knights.* Despite all adorn- ments the lord was no parasitic
idler. He rose at dawn, mounted his tower to detect any approaching
peril, hastily breakfasted, perhaps attended Mass, had “dinner” at 9
a.m., supervised the multifarious operations of the manor, shared
actively in some of them, gave orders of the day to steward, butler,
groom, and other servitors, received wayfarers and visitors, had
“supper” with them and his family at five, and usually retired at nine.
On some days the routine was broken by hunting, more rarely by
tournaments, now and then by war. He entertained frequently, and
exchanged presents lavishly with his guests.</p>
<p>His wife was almost as busy as himself. She bore and reared many
children. She directed the many servants (with an occasional box on the
ear), kept an eye on bakery, kitchen, and laundry, superintended the
making of butter and cheese, the brewing of beer, the salting down of
meat for the winter, and that major household industry of knitting,
sewing, spinning, weaving, and embroidery, which made most of the
family’s clothing. If her husband went to war she took over the military
and economic management of the estate, and was expected to supply his
financial needs as he campaigned; if he was taken prisoner she had to
squeeze a ransom for him out of the toil of his serfs or from the sale
of her finery and gems. If her husband died sonless she might inherit
the seigneury, and become its domina, dame ; but she was expected to
remarry soon to provide the estate and her suzerain with military
protection or service; and the suzerain limited her choice to a few
candidates capable of meeting these obligations. In the privacy of the
castle she could be an amazon or a termagant, and give her husband blow
for blow. In her leisure hours she dressed her vigorous body in flowing
fur-hemmed robes of silk, dainty head- gear and footwear, and gleaming
jewelry — an ensemble fit to send a trouba- dour into amorous or
literary ecstasy.</p>
<p>Her children received an education quite different from that of the
uni- versities. The sons of the aristocracy were rarely sent to public
schooling;</p>

<p>in many cases no effort was made to teach them how to read. Literacy
was left to clerks or scribes who could be hired for a pittance.
Intellectual knowl- edge was scorned by most feudal knights; du
Guesclin, one of the most hon- ored figures of chivalry, trained himself
in all the arts of war, and learned to face all weathers stoutly, but
never bothered to learn how to read; only in Italy and Byzantium did the
nobles carry on a literary tradition. Instead of going to a school, the
boy of knightly family was sent, about the age of seven, to serve as
page in another aristocratic household. There he learned obedi- ence,
discipline, manners, dress, the knightly code of honor, and the skills
of joust and war; perhaps the local priest added some training in
letters and reckoning. Girls were taught a hundred useful or pretty arts
by merely seeing and doing. They took care of guests, and of the knight
returning from battle or tournament; they unbuckled his armor, prepared
his bath, laid out clean linen and raiment and perfumes for him, and
waited on him at table with modest courtesy and tutored grace. They,
rather than the boys, learned to read and write; they provided most of
the audience for troubadours, trou- veres, and jongleurs, and for the
romantic prose and poetry of the time. The baron’s household often
included some vassals or retainers. The vassal was a man who, in return
for his military service, personal attendance, or political support,
received from the lord some substantial boon or privilege — usually a
tract of land with its serfs; in such cases usufruct belonged to the
vassal, ownership remained with the lord. A man too proud or strong to
be a serf, yet too limited to provide his own military security,
performed an act of “homage” to a feudal baron: knelt bareheaded and
weaponless before him, placed his hands in the hands of the seigneur,
declared himself that lord’s homme or man (while retaining his rights as
a freeman), and by an oath on sacred relics or the Bible pledged the
lord eternal fealty. The seigneur raised him, kissed him, invested him
with a fief,* and gave him, in symbol thereof, a straw, stick, lance, or
glove. Thenceforward the seigneur owed his vassal protection,
friendship, fidelity, and economic and legal aid; he must not, says a
medieval lawyer, insult his vassal, or seduce his vassal’s wife or
daughter ; 39 if he does, the vassal may “throw down the glove” as a de
-fy — i.e., as a release from fealty — and yet keep his fief.</p>
<p>The vassal might “subinfeudate” part of his land to a lesser vassal,
who would then bear the same relation and responsibility to him that he
bore to his lord. A man might hold fiefs from seve ral lords, and owe
them “simple homage” and limited service; but to one “liege” lord he
pledged “liege hom - age”— full allegiance and service in peace and war.
The lord himself, however great, might be vassal to another lord by
holding property or privilege in fief from him; he might even be vassal
to — hold a fief from — the vassal of another lord. All lords were
vassals of the king. In these intricate relationships the</p>

<p>prime bond was not economic but military; a man gave or owed military
serv- ice and personal fealty to a lord; property was merely his reward.
In theory feudalism was a magnificent system of moral reciprocity,
binding the men of an endangered society to one another in a complex web
of mutual obligation, protection, and fidelity.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The Feudal Church</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes the lord of the manor was a bishop or an abbot. Though many
monks labored with their hands, and many monasteries and cathedrals
shared in parish tithes, additional support was necessary for great
ecclesiastical estab- lishments; and this came mostly from kings and
nobles in gifts of land, or shares in feudal revenues. As these gifts
accumulated, the Church became the largest landholder in Europe, the
greatest of feudal suzerains. The monastery of Fulda owned 1 5,000 small
villas, that of St. Gall had 2000 serfs; 40 Alcuin at Tours was lord of
20,000 serfs. 41 Archbishops, bishops, and abbots received investiture
from the king, pledged their fealty to him like other feudatories,
carried such titles as duke and count, minted coin, presided over
episcopal or abbey courts, and took on the feudal tasks of military
service and agricultural management. Bishops or abbots accoutered with
armor and lance became a frequent sight in Germany and France; Richard
of Cornwall, in 1257, mourned that England had no such “warlike and
mettlesome bishops.” 42 So enmeshed in the feudal web, the Church found
herself a political, economic, and military, as well as a religious,
institution; her “temporalities” or material</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The King</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as the Church was in the twelfth century a feudal and
hierarchical structure of mutual protection, service, and fealty,
sanctioned by benefices and topped by a suzerain pope, so the secular
feudal regime demanded for its completion a lord of all vassals, a
suzerain of all secular suzerains, a king. Theoretically the king was
the vassal of God, and governed by divine right in the sense that God
permitted, and thereby authorized, his rule. Practically, however, the
king had been elevated by election, inheritance, or war. Men like
Charlemagne, Otto I, William the Conqueror, Philip Augustus, Louis IX,
Frederick II, and Louis the Fair enlarged their inherited power by force
of character or arms; but normally the kings of feudal Europe were not
so much the rulers of their peoples as the delegates of their vassals.
They were chosen or accepted by the great barons and ecclesiastics;
their direct power was lim-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 56 5</p>
<p>ited to their own feudal domain or manors; elsewhere in their kingdom
the serf and vassal swore fealty to the lord who protected them, rarely
to the king whose small and distant forces could not reach out to guard
the scattered out- posts of the realm. The state, in feudalism, was
merely the king’s estate.</p>
<p>In Gaul this atomization of rule proceeded furthest because the
Carolin- gian princes weakened themselves by dividing the empire,
because the bishops subdued them to ecclesiastical subservience, and
because the Norse attacks broke most violently upon France. In this
perfected feudalism the king was primus inter pares ; he stood an inch
or two above the princes, dukes, mar- quises, and counts; but in
practice he was, like these “peers of the realm,” a feudal baron limited
for revenue to his own lands, forced to move from one royal manor to
another for sustenance, and dependent in war and peace upon the military
aid or diplomatic service of rich vassals who- seldom pledged him more
than forty days of armed attendance in the year, and spent half their
time plotting to unseat him. To win or reward support, the crown had
granted estate after estate to powerful men; in the tenth and eleventh
cen- turies too small a domain remained to the French king to give him
secure ascendancy over his vassal lords. When they made their estates
hereditary, established their own police and courts, and minted their
own coinage, he lacked the force to prevent them. He could not interfere
with the jurisdic- tion of these vassals over their own lands except in
the capital cases that appealed to him; he could not send his officers
or tax collectors into their domains; he could not stop them from making
independent treaties or waging independent war. In feudal theory the
French king owned all the lands of the lords who called him their
sovereign; in reality he was merely a great landlord, not necessarily
the greatest; and never did his holdings equal those of the Church.</p>
<p>But as the inability of the kings to protect their realm had
generated feudalism, so the inability of feudal lords to maintain order
among them- selves, or to provide a uniform government for an expanding
commercial economy, weakened the barons and strengthened the kings. The
zeal for martial contests absorbed the aristocracies of feudal Europe in
private and public wars; the Crusades, the Hundred Years’ War, the Wars
of the Roses, and finally the wars of religion drank up their blood.
Some of them, impover- ished and recognizing no law, became robber
barons who pillaged and mur- dered at will; and the excesses of liberty
called for a unified power that would maintain order throughout the
realm. Commerce and industry generated a growing and wealthy class
outside the feudal bond; merchants resented feu- dal tolls and the
insecurity of transport through feudal domains; and they de- manded that
private law should be superseded by a central government. The king
allied himself with their class and the rising towns; they provided the
fi- nances for the assertion and extension of his authority; and all who
felt op- pressed or injured by the lords looked to the king for rescue
and redress. The</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>566</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>ecclesiastical barons were usually vassal and loyal to the king; the
popes, however often at odds with royalty, found it easier to deal with
a monarch than with a scattered and half-lawless nobility. Upheld by
these diverse forces, the French and English kings made their power
hereditary, instead of elective, by crowning a son or brother before
their own death; and men ac- cepted hereditary monarchy as the
alternative to feudal anarchy. The im- provement of communication and
the increased circulation of money made regular taxation possible; the
mounting royal revenue financed larger royal armies; the rising class of
jurists attached themselves to the throne, and strengthened it by the
centralizing influence of revived Roman law. By the year 1250 the
jurists asserted the royal jurisdiction over all persons in the realm;
and by that time the oath of allegiance was taken by all Frenchmen not
to their lord but to their king. At the end of the thirteenth century
Philip the Fair was strong enough to subdue not only his barons, but the
papacy itself.</p>
<p>The French kings softened the transition for the aristocracy by
replacing the rights of private coinage, judgment, and war with titles
and privileges at the royal court. The greater vassals formed the curia
regis, or king’s court; they became courtiers instead of potentates; and
the ritual of the baronial castle graduated into a ceremonious
attendance upon the audiences, the table, and the bedchamber of the
king. The sons and daughters of the nobility were sent to serve the king
and queen as pages or maids of honor, and learned the courtesies of the
court; the royal household became the school of the aris- tocracy of
France. The culminating ceremony was the coronation of the French king
at Reims, of the German emperor at Aachen or Frankfort; then all the
elite of the land gathered in awesome raiment and equipage; the Church
extended all the mystery and majesty of her rites to solemnize the ac-
cession of the new ruler; his power became thereby a divine authority,
which no man could gainsay except through brazen blasphemy. The feudal
lords crowded to the court of the monarchy that had subdued them, and
the Church conferred divine right upon the kings who would destroy her
Euro- pean leadership and power.</p>
<p>ni. FEUDAL LAW</p>
<p>In the feudal regime, where the judges and executors of civil law
were usually illiterate, custom and law were largely one. When question
rose as to law or penalty, the oldest members of the community were
asked what had been the custom thereon in their youth. The community
itself was therefore the chief source of law. The baron or king might
give commands, but these were not laws; and if he exacted more than
custom sanctioned he would be frustrated by uni- versal resistance,
vocal or dumb . 43 Southern France had a written law as a Roman
heritage; northern France, more feudal, preserved for the most part the
laws of</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 567</p>
<p>the Franks; and when in the thirteenth century these laws too were
put into writing, they became even harder to change than before, and a
hundred legal fictions rose to reconcile them with reality.</p>
<p>The feudal law of property was complex and unique. It recognized
three forms of land possession: (1) the allod, unconditional ownership;
(2) the fief — land whose usufruct, but not ownership, was ceded to a
vassal on condition of noble service; and (3) tenure — where the
usufruct was ceded to a serf or tenant on con- dition of feudal dues. In
feudal theory only the king enjoyed absolute ownership; even the
loftiest noble was a tenant, whose possession was conditional on
service. Nor was the lord’s possession completely indi vidual; every son
had a birthright in the ancestral lands, and could obstruct their sale.
44 Usually the whole estate was bequeathed to the eldest son. This
custom of primogeniture, unknown to Roman or barbarian law, 45 became
advisable under feudal conditions because it put the military protection
and economic management of the estate under one head, presumably the
most mature. Younger sons were encouraged to venture forth and carve out
new estates in other lands. Despite its limitations on ownership, feudal
law yielded to no other in reverence for property, and in severity of
pun- ishments for violating property rights. A German code held that if
a man re- moved the bark from one of the willow trees that held a dyke,
“his belly shall be ripped up, and his bowels shall be taken out and
wound around the harm he has done”; and as late as 1454 a Westphalian
ordinance held that a man who had criminally removed his neighbor’s
landmark should be buried in the earth with</p>
<p>Procedure in feudal law largely followed the barbarian codes, and
extended their efforts to substitute public penalties for private
revenge. Churches, market places, “towns of refuge” were endowed with
the right of sanctuary; by such restrictions vengeance might be stayed
till the law could supervene. Manorial courts tried cases between tenant
and tenant, or between tenant and lord; con- tests between lord and
vassal, or lord and lord, were submitted to a jury of “peers of the
barony”— men of at least equal standing, and of the same fief, 47 with
the complainant, and sitting in some baronial hall; episcopal or abbey
courts tried cases involving persons in orders; while the highest
appeals were heard by a royal court composed of peers of the realm, and
sometimes presided over by the king. In the manorial courts plaintiff as
well as defendant was imprisoned till judgment was pronounced. In all
courts the plaintiff who lost was subject to the same penalty that would
have been visited upon the defendant if guilty. Bribery was popular in
all courts. 48</p>
<p>Trial by ordeal continued throughout the feudal period. About the
year 1215 some heretics at Cambrai were subjected to the hot iron test;
suffering bums, they were led to the stake; but, we are told, one was
spared when, upon confessing his errors, his hand immediately healed,
leaving no trace of the burn. The growth of philosophy through the
twelfth century, and the renewed study of Roman law, begot a distaste
for these “ordeals of God.” Pope Innocent III secured their com - plete
prohibition by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1216; Henry III adopted
this prohibition into English law (1219), Frederick II into the
Neapolitan Code</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>568</p>
<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>(1231). In Germany the old tests persisted into the fourteenth
century; Savona- rola underwent the ordeal by fire at Florence in 1498;
it was revived in the trial of witches in the sixteenth century. 49</p>
<p>Feudalism encouraged the old Germanic trial by combat, partly as a
mode of proof, partly in lieu of private revenge. The Normans
re-established it in Britain after its disuse by the Anglo-Saxons, and
it remained on the English statute book till the nineteenth century. 50
In 1 1 27 a knight named Guy was accused by another named Hermann of
complicity in the assassination of Charles the Good of Flanders; on Guy
denying it, Hermann challenged him to a judicial duel; they fought for
hours, till they were both unhorsed and weaponless; they passed from
fencing to wrestling, and Hermann demonstrated the justice of his charge
by tearing Guy’s testicles from his body; whereupon Guy expired. 51
Perhaps ashamed of such barbarities, feudal custom accumulated
restrictions on the right to challenge. The accuser, to acquire such a
right, was required to make out a probable case; the defendant might
refuse to fight if he had proved an alibi; a serf could not challenge a
freeman, nor a leper a sound man, nor a bastard a man of legitimate
birth; in general one might challenge only a person of equal rank with
himself. The laws of several communities gave the court the right to
forbid any judicial duel at its discretion. Women, ecclesiastics, and
persons suffering physical disability were exempt from challenge, but
they might choose “cham - pions”— professionally skilled duelists — to
represent them. As early as the tenth century we find paid champions
used as substitutes even by able-bodied males; since God would decide
the issue according to the justice of the accusation, the identity of
the combatants seemed irrelevant. Otto I submitted to duel by cham-
pions the question of his daughter’s chastity, and the disputed
succession to cer- tain estates; 52 and in the thirteenth century King
Alfonso X of Castile had re- course to such a duel to decide whether he
should introduce Roman law into his kingdom. 53 Embassies were sometimes
supplied with champions in case dip- lomatic quarrels should admit of
resolution by duels. Until 182 1 such a champion figured in the
coronation ceremony of English kings; he was by that date a pic-
turesque relic; but in the Middle Ages he was supposed to fling his
gauntlet upon the ground and loudly proclaim his readiness to defend in
duel against any man the divine right of the new monarch to the crown.
54</p>
<p>The use of champions cast discredit upon trial by combat; the rising
bourgeoisie outlawed it in communal legislation; Roman law replaced it
in southern Europe in the thirteenth century. The Church repeatedly
denounced it, and Innocent III made the prohibition absolute (1215).
Frederick II excluded it from his Neapoli- tan dominions; Louis IX
abolished it in the regions directly subject to his rule (1260); and
Philip the Fair (1303) forbade it anywhere in France. The duel de- rives
not so much from judicial combat as from the ancient right of private
revenge.</p>
<p>Feudal penalties were barbarously severe. Fines were innumerable.
Imprison- ment was used as a detention for trial, rather than as a
punishment; but it could be a torture in itself when the cell was
infested with vermin, rats, or snakes. 55 Men and women might be
condemned to the public pillory or stocks, and be a target for public
ridicule, decayed food, or stones. The ducking stool was used</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 569</p>
<p>for minor crimes, and as a discouragement to gossips and shrews; the
condemned person was strapped to a chair which was fastened to a long
lever and was thereby submerged in a stream or a pond. Tougher convicts
could be sentenced to serve as galley slaves: half naked and poorly fed,
they were chained to the benches and compelled, on penalty of the
severest flogging, to row to exhaustion. Flogging with lash or rod was a
common punishment. Flesh — sometimes the face — might be branded with a
letter symbolizing the crime; perjury and blasphemy could be punished by
piercing the tongue with a hot iron. Mutilation was common; hands or
feet, ears or nose, were cut off, eyes were gouged out; and William the
Conqueror, to deter crime, decreed “that no one shall be killed or
hanged for any misdeeds, but rather that his eyes be plucked out, and
his hands, feet, and testicles cut off, so that whatever part of his
body remains will be a living sign to all of his crime and iniquity.” 56
Torture was little used in feudalism; Roman and ecclesiastical law
revived it in the thirteenth century. Theft or murder was pun- ished
sometimes with exile, more often with beheading or hanging; women mur-
derers were buried alive. 57 An animal that had killed a human being
might also be buried alive or hanged. Christianity preached mercy, but
ecclesiastical courts decreed the same penalties as lay courts for
similar crimes. The abbey court of St. Genevieve buried seven women
alive for theft. 58 Perhaps in a rude age bar- barous punishments were
needed to deter lawless men. But these barbarities con- tinued till the
eighteenth century; and the worst tortures were practiced not upon
murderers by barons but upon pious heretics by Christian monks.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>FEUDAL WAR</li>
</ol>
<p>Feudalism arose as the military organization of a harassed
agricultural society; its virtues were martial rather than economic; its
vassals and lords were expected to train themselves for war, and be
ready at any moment to leave the plowshare for the sword.</p>
<p>The feudal army was the feudal hierarchy organized by ties of feudal
allegiance, and strictly stratified according to grades of nobility.
Princes, dukes, marquises, counts, and archbishops were generals;
barons, seigneurs, bishops, and abbots were captains; knights or
chevaliers were cavalrymen; squires were servitors to barons or knights;
“men -at- arms”— the militia of communes or villages — fought as
infantry. Behind the feudal army, as we see it in the Crusades, a crowd
of “varlets” followed on foot, without officers or discipline; they
helped to despoil the conquered, and eased the suffering of fallen and
wounded enemies by despatching them with battle-axes or clubs. 59 But
essentially the feudal army was the man on horseback multiplied. Infan-
try, insufficiently mobile, had lost its pre-eminence since Hadrianople
(378), and would not regain it till the fourteenth century. Cavalry was
the battle arm of chivalry; they and the cavalier, the chevalier, and
the caballero took their names from the horse.</p>
<p>The feudal warrior used lance and sword or bow and arrow. The
knight</p>

<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>enlarged his ego to include his sword, and gave it an affectionate
name; though doubtless it was the trouveres who called Charlemagne’s
sword Joy - euse, Roland’s Dmandel, and Arthur’s Excalibur. The bow had
many forms: it might be a simple short bow, drawn at the breast; or a
longbow aimed from the eye and ear; or a crossbow, in which the cord,
drawn taut in the groove of a stock, was suddenly released, sometimes by
a trigger, and propelled a missile of iron or stone. The crossbow was
old; the longbow was first promi- nently used by Edward I ( 1 272-1 307)
in his wars with the Welsh. In Eng- land archery was the main element in
military training, and a leading element in sport. The development of
the bow began the military debacle of feudal- ism; the knight scorned to
fight on foot, but the archers killed his horse, and forced him to
uncongenial ground. The final blow to feudal military power would come
in the fourteenth century with gunpowder and cannon, which, from a safe
distance, killed the armored knight and shattered his castle.</p>
<p>Having a horse to carry him, the feudal warrior could afford to
burden himself with armor. In the twelfth century the fully accoutered
knight cov- ered his body from neck to knees with a hauberk — a coat of
chain mail with sleeves for the arms — and an iron hood that covered all
the head except eyes, nose, and mouth; his legs and feet were housed in
greaves of mail. In combat he further capped himself with a steel helmet
whose “nasal”— a projecting iron blade — guarded the nose. The visored
casque and armor of metal plates appeared in the fourteenth century as
defense against the long- or crossbow, and continued till the
seventeenth; then nearly all armor was abandoned for the advantages of
mobility. As a shield the knight suspended from his neck, and grasped by
inner straps with his left hand, a buckler made of wood, leather, and
iron bands, and adorned at the center with a buckle of gilded iron. The
medieval knight was a mobile fort.</p>
<p>Fortification was the chief and usually adequate defense in feudal
war. An army defeated in the field might find refuge within manor walls,
and a last stand could be made in the donjon tower. The science of siege
declined in the Middle Ages; the complex organization and equipment for
battering down enemy walls proved too costly or laborious for dignified
knights; but the art of the sapper or military miner held its own.
Navies, too, were reduced in a world whose will to war outran its means.
War galleys remained like those of the ancients — armed with battle
towers on the decks, and propelled by freemen or galley slaves. What was
lacking in power was made up in ornament, on the ship as on the man.
Over a coat of pitch that preserved the wood of the vessel from water
and air, medieval shipwrights and artists painted brilliant colors mixed
with wax — white, vermilion, ultramarine blue; they gilded the prow and
rails, and sculptured figures of men, beasts, and gods on prow and
stern. Sails were gaily tinted, some in purple, some in gold; and a
seigneur’s ship was emblazoned with his coat of arms.</p>
<p>Feudal war differed from both ancient and modern war in greater

<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 57 1</p>
<p>quency and less mortality and cost. Every baron claimed the right of
private war against any man not bound to him by feudal ties, and every
king was free to embark at any time upon honorable robbery of another
ruler’s lands. When king or baron went to war, all his vassals and
relatives to the seventh degree were pledged to follow and fight for him
for forty days. There was scarce a day in the twelfth century when some
part of what is now France was not at war. To be a good warrior was the
crown of a knight’s develop - ment; he was expected to give or take hard
blows with relish or fortitude; his last ambition was a warrior’s death
on “the field of honor,” not a “cow’s death” in bed. 60 Berthold of
Ratisbon complained that “so few great lords reach their right age or
die a right death”; 61 but Berthold was a monk.</p>
<p>The game was not too dangerous. Ordericus Vitalis, describing the
battle of Bremule ( 1 1 19) , reports that “of the 900 knights who
fought, only three were killed.” 62 At the battle of Tinchebrai ( 1
106), where Henry I of Eng - land won all Nor mandy, 400 knights were
captured, but not one of Henry’s knights was slain. At Bouvines (1214),
one of the most bloody and decisive battles of the Middle Ages, 170 of
1500 knights engaged lost their lives. 63 Armor and fortress gave
advantage to the defense; a fully armored man could hardly be killed
except by cutting his throat as he lay on the ground; and this was
discountenanced by chivalry. Moreover it was wiser to capture a knight
and accept ransom for him than to slay him and invite feud revenge.
Froissart mourned the slaughter, at one battle, of “as many good
prisoners as would well have brought 400,000 francs.” 64 Knightly rules
and reciprocal prudence counseled courtesy to prisoners, and moderation
in ransoms asked. Usually a prisoner was released on his word of honor
to return with his ransom by a given date, and rare was the knight who
broke such a pledge. 65 It was the peasantry that suffered most from
feudal wars. In France, Germany, and Italy each army raided the lands
and pillaged the houses of the vassals and serfs of the enemy, and
captured or killed all cattle not gathered within de- fensive walls.
After such a war many peasants drew their own plows, and many starved to
death for lack of grain.</p>
<p>Kings and princes strove to maintain some interludes of internal
peace. The Norman dukes succeeded in Normandy, England, and Sicily; the
count of Flanders in his realm, the count of Barcelona in Catalonia,
Henry III for a generation in Germany. For the rest it was the Church
that led in limiting war. From 989 to 1050 various Church councils in
France decreed a Pax Dei , or Peace of God, and promised excommunication
to all who should use vio- lence upon noncombatants in war. The French
Church organized a peace movement in various centers, and persuaded many
nobles not only to forgo private war but to join in outlawing it. Bishop
Fulbert of Chartres (960?-</p>
<p>1028), in a famous hymn, gave thanks to God for the unaccustomed
peace. The movement was enthusiastically acclaimed by the common people,
and good souls prophesied that within five years the peace program would
be</p>
<p>572 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>accepted by all Christendom. 66 French Church councils, from 1027 on,
pro- claimed the Treuga Dei, or Truce of God, perhaps recalling the
Moslem prohibition of war in time of pilgrimage: all were to abstain
from violence during Lent, in season of harvest or vintage (August 1 5
to November 1 1 ) , on specified holydays, and for a part of each week —
usually from Wednesday evening to Monday morning; in its final form the
Truce allowed eighty days in the year for private or feudal war. These
appeals and fulminations helped; private war was gradually ended by the
co-operation of the Church, the growing strength of the monarchies, the
rise of the towns and bourgeoisie, and the absorption of martial
energies in the Crusades. In the twelfth century the Truce of God became
part of civil, as well as of canon, law in western Europe. The Second
Lateran Council (1139) forbade the use of military engines against men.
67 In 1190 Gerhoh of Reichersburg proposed that the pope should forbid
all wars among Christians, and that all disputes among Christian rulers
should be submitted to papal arbitration. 68 The kings thought this a
bit too advanced; they waged international wars more abundantly as
private wars decreased; and in the thirteenth century the popes
themselves, playing the royal game of power with human pawns, used war
as an instru- ment of policy.</p>
<p>V. CHIVALRY</p>
<p>Out of old Germanic customs of military initiation, crossed with
Saracen influences from Persia, Syria, and Spain, and Christian ideas of
devotion and sacrament, flowered the imperfect but generous reality of
chivalry.</p>
<p>A knight was a person of aristocratic birth — i.e., of titled and
landowning family — who had been formally received into the order of
knighthood. Not all “gentle” men (i.e., men distinguished by their gens
or ancestry) were eligible to knighthood or title; younger sons, except
of royal blood, were normally confined to modest properties that
precluded the expensive appur- tenances of chivalry; such men remained
squires unless they carved out new lands and titles of their own.</p>
<p>The youth who aimed at knighthood submitted to long and arduous dis-
cipline. At seven or eight he entered as a page, at twelve or fourteen
as a squire, into the service of a lord; waited upon him at table, in
the bedchamber, on the manor, in joust or battle; fortified his own
flesh and spirit with danger- ous exercises and sports; learned by
imitation and trial to handle the weapons of feudal war. When his
apprenticeship was finished he was received into the knightly order by a
ritual of sacramental awe. The candidate began with a bath as a symbol
of spiritual, perhaps as a guarantee of physical, purification; hence he
could be called a “knight of the bath,” as distinguished from those
“knights of the sword” who had received their accolade on some
battlefield as immediate reward for bravery. He was clothed in white
tunic, red robe,</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 573</p>
<p>and black coat, representing respectively the hoped-for purity of his
morals, the blood he might shed for honor or God, and the death he must
be prepared to meet unflinchingly. For a day he fasted; he passed a
night at church in prayer, confessed his sins to a priest, attended
Mass, received communion, heard a sermon on the moral, religious,
social, and military duties of a knight, and solemnly promised to
fulfill them. He then advanced to the altar with a sword hanging from
his neck; the priest removed the sword, blessed it, and replaced it upon
his neck. The candidate turned to the seated lord from whom he sought
knighthood, and was met with a stern question: “For what</p>
<p>He was now privileged to risk his life in tournaments that would
train him still further in skill, endurance, and bravery. Begun in the
tenth century, the tournament flourished above all in France, and
sublimated some part of the passions and energies that disordered feudal
life. It might be proclaimed through a herald, by a king or a great
lord, to celebrate the ordination of a knight, the visit of a sovereign,
or the marriage of royal blood.-The knights who offered to take part
came to the appointed town, hung their armorial bearings from the
windows of their rooms, and affixed their coats of arms to castles,
monasteries, and other public places. Spectators examined these, and
were free to lodge complaint of wrong done by any intending participant;
tournament officials would hear the case, and disqualify the guilty;
there was then a “blot on his ’scutcheon,” or shield. To the excited
gathering came horse dealers to equip the knight, haberdashers to clothe
him and his horse in fit array, moneylenders to ransom the fallen,
fortunetellers, acrobats, mimes, troubadours and trouveres, wandering
scholars, women of loose morals, and ladies of high degree. The whole
occasion was a colorful festival of song and dance, trysts and brawls,
and wild betting on the contests.</p>

<p>(chap. XXII</p>
<p>in 1285 Sunday was a day of assembly and fete; Monday and Tuesday
were given to jousts; Wednesday was a day of rest; Thursday saw the
tourney that gave its name to the tournament. The lists, or field of
battle, were a town square or an outlying open space, partly enclosed by
stands and balconies from which the richer gentry, clothed in all the
splendor of medieval cos- tume, watched the fray; commoners stood on
foot around the field. The stands were decorated with tapestries,
drapes, pennants, and coats of arms. Musicians prefaced the engagement
with music, and celebrated with flour- ishes the most brilliant strokes
of the game. Between contests the noble lords and ladies scattered coins
among the pedestrian crowd, who received them with crie s of “Largesse!”
and “Noel!”</p>
<p>Before the first contest the knights entered the lists by marching on
to the field in brilliant equipage and stately steps, followed by their
mounted squires, and sometimes led in gold or silver chains by the
ladies for whose glory they were to fight. Usually each knight carried
on his shield, helmet, or lance a scarf, veil, mantle, bracelet, or
ribbon that his chosen lady had taken from her dress.</p>
<p>The joust or tilt was a single combat of rival knights; they rode
agains t each other “at full tilt,” and launched their lances of steel.
If either contestant was unhorsed the rules required the other to
dismount; and the fight was contin- ued on foot till one or the other
cried quits, or was hors de combat through fatigue or wounds or death,
or until judges or king called a halt. The victor then appeared before
the judges, and solemnly received a prize from them or from some fair
lady. Several such tilts might fill « day. The climax of the festival
came with the tourney; the enlisted knights ranged themselves in opposed
groups, and fought an actual battle, though usually with blunted arms;
in the tourney at Neuss ( 1 240) some sixty knights were killed. In such
tourneys prisoners were taken, and ransom exacted, as in war; the horses
and armor of the captives belonged to the victors; the knights loved
money even more than war. The fabliaux tell of a knight who protested
the Church’s con - demnation of tournaments on the ground that if
effective it would end his only means of livelihood. 69 When all the
contests were over the survivors and the noble spectators joined in an
evening of feasting, song, and dance. The winning knights enjoyed the
privilege of kissing the loveliest women, and heard poems and songs
composed in commemoration of their victories.</p>
<p>Theoretically the knight was required to be a hero, a gentleman, and
a saint. The Church, anxious to tame the savage breast, surrounded the
institu- tion of knighthood with religious forms and vows. The knight
pledged him- self always to speak the truth, defend the Church, protect
the poor, make peace in his province, and pursue the infidels. To his
liege lord he owed a loyalty more binding than filial love; to all women
he was to be a guardian, saving their chastity; to all knights he was to
be a brother in mutual courtesy</p>
<p>FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl)</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>and aid. In war he might fight other knights; but if he took any of
them prisoner he must treat them as his guests; so the French knights
captured at Crecy and Poitiers lived, till ransomed, in freedom and
comfort on the estates of their English captors, sharing in feasts and
sports with their hosts . 70 Above the conscience of the commons
feudalism exalted the aristocratic honor and noblesse oblige of the
knight — a pledge of martial valor and feudal fidelity, of unstinting
service fo all knights, all women, all weak or poor. So virtus ,
manliness, was restored to its Roman masculine sense after a thousand
years of Christian emphasis on feminine virtues. Chivalry, despite its
religious aura, represented a victory of Germanic, pagan, and Arab
conceptions over Christianity; a Europe attacked on every side needed
the martial virtues again.</p>
<p>All this, however, was chivalric theory. A few knights lived up to
it, as a few Christians rose to the arduous heights of Christian
selflessness. But human nature, born of jungle and beast, sullied the
one ideal like the other. The same hero who one day fought bravely in
tournament or battle might on another be a faithless murderer; he might
carry his honor as proudly as his plume, and, like Lancelot, Tristram,
and realer knights, break up fine families with adul- tery. He might
prate of protecting the weak, and strike unarmed peasants down with a
sword; he treated with scorn the manual worker on whose labor rested his
citadel of gallantry, and with frequent coarseness and occasional
brutality the wife whom he had sworn to cherish and protect . 71 He
could hear Mass in the morning, rob a church in the afternoon, and drink
himself into obscenity at night; so Gildas, who lived among them,
described the Brit- ish knights of that sixth century in which some
poets placed Arthur and “the</p>
<p>Two influences moderated the barbarism of chivalry: woman and Chris-
tianity. The Church partly succeeded in diverting feudal pugnacity into
the Crusades. Perhaps she was helped by the rising adoration of Mary the
Virgin Mother; once more the feminine virtues were exalted to check the
bloody ardor of vigorous men. But it may be that living women, appealing
to sense as well as soul, had even more influence in transforming the
warrior into a</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>(chap, xxn</p>
<p>gentleman. The Church repeatedly forbade tournaments, and was gaily
ig- nored by the knights; the ladies attended tournaments, and were not
ignored. The Church frowned upon the role of women in tournaments and in
poetry; a conflict arose between the morals of noble ladies and the
ethics of the Church; and in the feudal world the ladies and the poets
won.</p>
<p>Romantic love — i.e., love that idealizes its object — has probably
occurred in every age, in degree loosely corresponding with the delay
and obstacles between desire and fulfillment. Until our own age it was
rarely the cause of marriage; and if we find it quite apart from
marriage when knighthood was in flower, we must view that condition as
more normal than our own. In most ages, and above all in feudalism,
women married men for their property, and admired other men for their
charm. Poets, having no property, had to marry at low level or love at
long range, and they aimed their fairest songs at in- accessible dames.
The distance between lover and beloved was usually so great that even
the most passionate poetry was taken as only a pretty com- pliment, and
a well-mannered lord rewarded poets for inditing amorous verses to his
wife. So the viscount of Vaux continued his hospitality and favors to
the troubadour Peire Vidal after Peire addressed love poems to the
viscountess — even after Peire had tried to seduce her 7B — though this
was a degree of amiability not usually to be presumed upon. The
troubadour argued that marriage, combining a maximum of opportunity with
a minimum of temptation, could hardly engender or sustain romantic love;
even the pious Dante seems never to have dreamed of addressing love
poems to his wife, or to have found any unseemliness in addressing them
to another woman, single or married. The knight agreed with the poet
that knightly love had to be for some other lady than his own wife,
usually for the wife of another knight . 76 Most knights, though we must
not often suspect them of marital fidelity, laughed at “courtly love,”
resigned themselves in time to their mates, and consoled themselves with
war. We hear of knights turning cold ears to ladies offering romance .
77 Roland, in the Chanson , died with scarce a thought of his affianced
bride Aude, who would die of grief on hearing of his death. Women, too,
were not all romantic; but from the twelfth century it became a
convention with many of them that a lady should have a lover, Platonic
or Byronic, added to her husband. If we may believe the medieval
romances, the knight was pledged to the devoir or service of the lady
who had given him her colors to wear; she could impose dangerous
exploits to test or distance him; and if he served her well she was
expected to reward him with an embrace or better; this is the “guerdon”
that he claimed. To her he dedicated all his feats of arms; it was her
name that he invoked in the crises of combat or the breath of death.
Here again feudalism was not a part of Christianity but its opposite and
rival. Women, theologically so stinted in love, asserted their freedom
and molded their own moral code; the worship of woman in the flesh
competed with the adoration of the Virgin. Love proclaimed itself</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIl) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 577</p>
<p>an independent principle of worth, and offered ideals of service,
norms of conduct, scandalously ignoring religion even when borrowing its
terms and forms. 78</p>
<p>So complicated a severance of love and marriage raised many problems
of morals and etiquette; and, as in Ovid’s days, authors dealt with
these ques - tions with all the nicety of casuists. Some time between
1174 and 1182 one Andreas Capellanus — Andrew the Chaplain — composed a
Tractatus de amore et de amoris remedio ( Treatise on Love and Its Cure)
, in which, among other matters, he laid down the code and principles of
“courtly love.” Andrew limits such love to the aristocracy; he
unblushingly assumes that it is the illicit passion of a knight for
another knight’s wife , but considers its distinguishing characteristic
as the homage, vassalage, and service of the man to the woman. This book
is the chief authority for the existence of medieval “courts of love,”
in which titled ladies answered queries and hande.d down decisions about
r amour courtois . In Andrew’s time, if we may credit his account, the
leading lady in this procedure was the princess poetess Marie, Countess
of Cham- pagne; a generation earlier it had been her mother, the most
fascinating woman in feudal society, Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine,
sometime Queen of France, and later of England. Occasionally, according
to the Tractatus , mother and daughter presided together as judges in
the court of love at Poitiers. 79 Andrew knew Marie well, served her as
chaplain, and apparently wrote his book to publish her theories and
judgments of love. “Love,” he says, “teaches everyone to abound in good
manners”; under Marie’s tutelage, we are assured, the rough aristocracy
of Poitiers became a society of generous women and gallant men.</p>
<p>The poems of the troubadours contain several references to such
courts of love, maintained by high ladies — the viscountess of Narbonne,
the count- ess of Flanders, and others — at Pierrefeu, Avignon, and
elsewhere in France; 80 ten, fourteen, sixty women, we are told, sat in
judgment on cases submitted to them mostly by women, sometimes by men;
disputes were settled, lovers’ quarrels healed, penalties laid upon
violators of the code. So (according to Andrew) Marie of Champagne, on
April 27, 1174, issued a responsum to the inquiry, “Can real love exist
between married people?” She replied in the negative on the ground that
“lovers grant everything gratuitously, with - out being constrained by
any motive of necessity; married people are com- pelled as a duty to
submit to one another’s wishes.” 81 All the courts, says our merry
Andrew, agreed on thirty- one “Laws of Love”: (1) Marriage</p>
<p>cannot be pleaded as an excuse for refusing to love ( 3 ) No one can
really love two people at the same time. (4) Love never stands still; it
always increases or diminishes. (5) Favors unwillingly yielded are
tasteless. . . . ( 1 1 ) It is not becoming to love those ladies who
only love with a view to marriage. . . . (14) Too easy possession
renders love contemptible; posses- sion that is attended with
difficulties makes love … of great price ( 19) If</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXII</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>love once begins to diminish, it quickly fades away, and rarely
recovers. . . . (21) Love invariably increases under the influence of
jealousy. … (23) A person who is the prey of love eats little and sleeps
little. … (26) Love can deny nothing to love. 82</p>
<p>These courts of love, if they ever existed, were parts of a kind of
parlor game played by the ladies of the aristocracy; busy barons took no
known notice of them, and amorous knights made their own rules. But
there can be no doubt that increasing wealth and idleness generated a
romance and eti- quette of love that filled the poetry of the
troubadours and the early Renais- sance. “In June, 1283,” writes the
Florentine historian Villani ( 1 28 o? -i 348) , at the festival of
St. John, when the city of Florence was happy, quiet, and at peace … a
social union was formed, composed of a thousand people who, all clad in
white, called themselves the Servants of Love.</p>
<p>They arranged a succession of sports, merrymakings, and dances with
ladies; nobles and bourgeois marched to the sound of trumpets and music,
and held festive banquets at midday and at night. This Court</p>
<p>of Love lasted nearly two months, and it was the finest and most fa-
mous that had ever been in Tuscany. 83</p>
<p>Chivalry, beginning in the tenth century, reached its height in the
thir- teenth, suffered from the brutality of the Hundred Years’ War,
shriveled in the merciless hate that divided the English aristocracy in
the Wars of the Roses, and died in the theological fury of the religious
wars of the sixteenth century. But it left its decisive mark upon the
society, education, manners, literature, art, and vocabulary of medieval
and modern Europe. The orders of knighthood — of the Garter, the Bath,
the Golden Fleece — multiplied to the number of 234 in Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain; and schools like Eton, Ha rrow, and Winchester
combined the chivalric ideal with “liberal” education in the most
effective training of mind and will and character in pedagogical
history. As the knight learned manners and gallantry at the court of
noble or king, so he transmitted something of this courtoisie to those
below him in the social scale; modern politeness is a dilution of
medieval chivalry. The literature of Europe flourished, from the Chanson
de Roland to Don Quixote, by treating knightly characters and themes;
and the redis- covery of chivalry was one of the exciting elements in
the Romantic move- ment of literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Whatever its excesses and absurdities in literature, however
far chivalry in fact fell short of its ideals, it remains one of the
major achievements of the human spirit, an art of life more splendid
than any art.</p>
<p>In this perspective the feudal picture is not merely one of serfdom,
illiter- acy, exploitation, and violence, but as truly a scene of lusty
peasants clearing the wilderness; of men colorful and vigorous in
language, love, and war; of knights pledged to honor and service,
seeking adventure and fame rather than comfort and security, and
scorning danger, death, and hell; of women</p>
<p>CHAP.XXII) FEUDALISM AND CHIVALRY 579</p>
<p>patiently toiling and breeding in peasant cottages, and titled ladies
mingling the tenderest prayers to the Virgin with the bold freedom of a
sensuous poetry and courtly love — perhaps feudalism did more than
Christianity to raise the status of woman. The great task of feudalism
was to restore polit- ical and economic order to Europe after a century
of disruptive invasions and calamities. It succeeded; and when it
decayed, modern civilization rose upon its ruins and its legacy.</p>
<p>The Dark Ages are not a period upon which the scholar can look with
superior scorn. He no longer denounces their ignorance and superstition,
their political disintegration, their economic and cultural poverty; he
mar- vels, rather, that Europe ever recovered from the successive blows
of Goths, Huns, Vandals, Moslems, Magyars, and Norse, and preserved
through the turmoil and tragedy so much of ancient letters and
techniques. He can feel only admiration for the Charlemagnes, Alfreds,
Olafs, and Ottos who forced an order upon this chaos; for the Benedicts,
Gregorys, Bonifaces, Columbas, Alcuins, Brunos, who so patiently
resurrected morals and letters out of the wilderness of their times; for
the prelates and artisans that could raise cathe- drals, and the
nameless poets that could sing, between one war or terror and the next.
State and Church had to begin again at the bottom, as Romulus and Numa
had done a thousand years before; and the courage required to build
cities out of jungles, and citizens out of savages, was greater than
that which would raise Chartres, Amiens, and Reims, or cool Dante’s
vengeful fever into measured verse.</p>
