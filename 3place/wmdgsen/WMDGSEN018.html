<p>The Life of the People*</p>
<p>I. THE MAKERS OF WEALTH</p>
<p>The jungle background — Agriculture — Mining — Handicrafts —</p>
<p>Commerce — Money — Taxes — Famines — Poverty and wealth</p>
<p>T HE soil of India had not lent itself willingly to civilization. A
great</p>
<p>part of it was jungle, the jealously guarded home of lions, tigers,
ele- phants, serpents, and other individualists with a Rousseauian
contempt for civilization. The biological struggle to free the land from
these enemies had continued underneath all the surface dramas of
economic and political strife. Akbar shot tigers near Mathura, and
captured wild elephants in many places where none can be found today. In
Vedic times the lion might be met with anywhere in northwest or central
India; now it is al- most extinct throughout the peninsula. The serpent
and the insect, how- ever, still carry on the war: in 1926 some two
thousand Hindus were killed by wild animals (875 by marauding tigers);
but twenty thousand Hindus met death from the fangs of snakes. 1</p>
<p>Gradually, as the soil was redeemed from the beast, it was turned to
the cultivation of rice, pulse, millet, vegetables and fruits. Through
the greater part of Indian history the majority of the population have
lived abstemiously on these natural foods, reserving flesh, fish and
fowl for the Outcastes and the rich.T To render their diet more
exciting, and perhaps to assist</p>
<p>Aphrodite, 3 the Hindus have grown and consumed an unusual abundance
of curry, ginger, cloves, cinnamon and other spices. Europeans valued
these spices so highly that they stumbled upon a hemisphere in search
for them; who knows but that America was discovered for the sake of
love? In Vedic times the land belonged to the people, 3 but from the
days of Chan- dragupta Maurya it became the habit of the kings to claim
royal owner-</p>
<ul>
<li>The following analysis will apply for the most part to post-Vedic
and pre-British India. The reader should remember that India is now in
flux, and that institutions, morals and manners once characteristic of
her may be disappearing today.</li>

oxen and cows), as well as lizards, rats and cats . 4</p>

<p>ship of all the soil, and to let it out to the tiller for an annual
rental and tax. 6 Irrigation was usually a governmental undertaking. One
of the dams raised by Chandragupta functioned till 150 a.d.; remains of
the ancient canals can be seen everywhere today; and signs still survive
of the artificial lake that Raj Sing, Rajput Rana of Mewar, built as an
irrigation reservoir (1661), and which he surrounded with a. marble wall
twelve miles in length. 7 The Hindus seem to have been the first people
to mine gold. 8 Herodotus® and Megasthenes 10 tell of the great “gold
-digging ants, in size somewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes,”
which helped the miners to find the metal by turning it up in their
scratching of the sand.* Much of the gold used in the Persian Empire in
the fifth century before Christ came from India. Silver, copper, lead,
tin, zinc and iron were also mined — iron as early as 1500 b.c. u The
art of tempering and casting iron developed in India long before its
known appearance in Europe; Vikramaditya, for example, erected at Delhi
(ca. 380 a.d.) an iron pillar that stands untarnished today after
fifteen cen- turies; and the quality of metal, or manner of treatment,
which has pre- served it from rust or decay is still a mystery to modem
metallurgical science. 12 Before the European invasion the smelting of
iron in small char- coal furnaces was one of the major industries of
India. 13 The Industrial Revolution taught Europe how to carry out these
processes more cheaply on a larger scale, and the Indian industry died
under the competition. Only in our own time are the rich mineral
resources of India being again exploited and explored. 14</p>
<p>The growing of cotton appears earlier in India than elsewhere;
apparently it was used for cloth in Mohenjo-daro. 1B In our oldest
classical reference to cotton Herodotus says, with pleasing ignorance:
“Certain wild trees there</p>

<p>delicacy than in any other part of the wo rld.” 20 The shawls of
Kashmir and the rugs of India bear witness even today to the excellence
of Indian weav- ing in texture and design.* But weaving was only one of
the many handi- crafts of India, and the weavers were only one of the
many craft and merchant guilds that organized and regulated the industry
of India. Europe looked upon the Hindus as experts in almost every line
of manufacture — wood-work, ivory-work, metal-work, bleaching, dyeing,
tanning, soap-mak- ing, glass-blowing, gunpowder, fireworks, cement,
etc. 21 China imported eyeglasses from India in 1260 a.d. Bernier,
traveling in India in the seven- teenth century, described it as humming
with industry. Fitch, in 1585, saw a fleet of one hundred and eighty
boats carrying a great variety of goods down the river Jumna.</p>
<p>Internal trade flourished; every roadside was — and is — a bazaar.
The for- eign trade of India is as old as her history; 22 objects found
in Sumeria and Egypt indicate a traffic between these countries and
India as far back as 3000 b.c. 23 Commerce between India and Babylon by
the Persian Gulf flour- ished from 700 to 480 b.c.; and perhaps the
“ivory, apes and peacocks” of Solomon came by the same route from the
same source. India’s ships sailed the sea to Burma and China in
Chandragupta’s days; and Greek merchants, called Yavana (Ionians) by the
Hindus, thronged the markets of Dravidian India in the centuries before
and after the birth of Christ. 24 Rome, in her epicurean days, depended
upon India for spices, perfumes and unguents, and paid great prices for
Indian silks, brocades, muslins and cloth of gold; Pliny condemned the
extravagance which sent ,000,000 yearly from Rome to India for such
luxuries. Indian cheetahs, tigers and elephants as- sisted in the
gladiatorial games and sacrificial rites of the Colosseum. 25 The
Parthian wars were fought by Rome largely to keep open the trade route
to India. In the seventh century the Arabs captured Persia and Egypt,
and thereafter trade between Europe and Asia passed through Moslem
hands; hence the Crusades, and Columbus. Under the Moguls foreign
commerce rose again; the wealth of Venice, Genoa and other Italian
cities grew through their service as ports for European trade with India
and the East; the Renaissance owed more to the wealth derived from this
trade than to the manuscripts brought to Italy by the Greeks. Akbar had
an admiralty which supervised the building of ships and the regulation
of ocean traffic; the ports of Bengal and Sindh were famous for
shipbuilding, and did their work so well that the Sultan of
Constantinople found it cheaper to have his vessels built there than in
Alexandria; even the East India Company had many of its ships built in
Bengal docks. 28</p>

</ul>
<p>480 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>The development of coinage to facilitate this trade took many
centuries. In Buddha’s days rough rectangula r coins were issued by
various economic and political authorities; but it was not until the
fourth century before Christ that India, under the influence of Persia
and Greece, arrived at a coin- age guaranteed by the state. 27 Sher Shah
issued well-designed pieces of copper, silver and gold, and established
the rupee as the basic coin of the realm. 28 Under Akbar and Jehangir
the coinage of India was superior, in artistic execution and purity of
metal, to that of any modern European state. 20 As in medieval Europe,
so in medieval India the growth of industry and commerce was impeded by
a religious antipathy to the taking of in- terest. “The Indians,” says
Megasthenes, “neither put out money at usury” (interest), “nor know how
to borrow. It is contra ry to established usage for an Indian either to
do or to suffer wrong; and therefore they neither make contracts nor
require securities.” 30 When the Hindu could not invest his savings in
his own economic enterprises he preferred to hide them, or to buy
jewelry as conveniently hoardable wealth. 31 Perhaps this failure to
develop a facile credit system aided the Industrial Revolution to
establish the Euro- pean domination of Asia. Slowly, however, despite
the hostility of the Brahmans, money-lending grew. The rates varied,
according to the caste of the borrower, from twelve to sixty per cent,
usually ranging about twenty. 33 Bankruptcy was not permitted as“a
liquidation of debts; if a debtor died in- solvent his descendants to
the sixth generation continued to be responsible for his obligations.
33</p>
<p>Both agriculture and trade were heavily taxed to support the
government. The peasant had to surrender from one-sixth to one-half of
his crop; and, as in medieval and contemporary Europe, many tolls were
laid upon the flow and exchange of goods. 34 Akbar raised the land-tax
to one-third, but abolished all other exactions. 35 The land-tax was a
bitter levy, but it had the saving grace of rising with prosperity and
falling with depression; and in famine years the poor could at least die
untaxed. For famines occurred, even in Akbar’s palmy days; that of 1556
seems to have led to cannibalism and widespread desolation. Roads were
bad, transportation was slow, and the surplus of one region could with
difficulty be used to supply the dearth of another.</p>
<p>As everywhere, there were extremes of poverty and wealth, but hardly
so great as in India or America today. At the bottom was a small
minority of slaves; above them the Shudras were not so much slaves as
hired men, though their status, like that of almost all Hindus, was
hereditary. The poverty described by Pere Dubois (1820) 30 was the
result of fifty years of political chaos; under the Moguls the condition
of the people had been rela-</p>

<p>tively prosperous.” Wages were modest, ranging for manual workers
from three to nine cents a day in Akbar’s reign; but prices were
correspondingly low. In 1600 a rupee (normally 32.5 cents) bought 194
pounds of wheat, or 278 pounds of barley; in 1901 it bought only 29
pounds of wheat, or 44 pounds of barley. 38 An Englishman resident in
India in 1616 described “the</p>
<p>The wealth of the country reached its two peaks under Chandragupta
Maurya and Shah Jehan. The riches of India under the Gupta kings</p>
<p>became a proverb throughout the world. Yuan Chwang pictured an</p>

insti- tutes of letters and arts; “the inhabitants were well off, and
there were</p>

he</p>
<p>described the riches that he had found about him in India — opulent
cities ready to offer him any bribe to escape indiscriminate plunder,
bankers throwing open to his grasp vaults piled high with jewels and
gold; and he concluded: “At this moment I stand astonished at my own
moderation.”®</p>

<p>Because the roads were poor and communication difficult, it was</p>
<p>easier to conquer than to rule India. Its topography ordained that
this semi-continent would remain, until the coming of railways, a medley
of divided states. Under such conditions a government could have
security only through a competent army; and as the army required, in
frequent crises, a dictatorial leader immune to political eloquence, the
form of gov- ernment which developed in India was naturally monarchical.
The people enjoyed a considerable measure of liberty under the native
dynasties, partly through the autonomous communities in the villages and
the trade guilds in the towns, and partly through the limitations that
the Brah- man aristocracy placed upon the authority of the king.® The
laws of Manu, though they were more a code of ethics than a system of
prac- tised legislation, expressed the focal ideas of India about
monarchy: that it should be impartially rigorous, and paternally
solicitous of the public good.® The Mohammedan rulers paid less
attention than their Hindu predecessors to these ideals and checks; they
were a conquering minority, and rested their rule frankly on the
superiority of their guns. “The army,” says a Moslem historian, with
charming clarity, “is the source and means of government .” 63 Akbar was
an exception, for he relied chiefly u pon the good will of a people
prospering under his mild and benevolent</p>
<p>despotism. Perhaps in the circumstances his was the best government
pos- sible. Its vital defect, as we have seen, lay in its dependence
upon the character of the king; the supreme centralized authority that
proved beneficent under Akbar proved ruinous under Aurangzeb. Having
been raised up by violence, the Afghan and Mogul rulers were always
subject</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 483</p>
<p>to recall by assassination; and wars of succession were almost as ex-
pensive — though not as disturbing to economic life — as a modern
election.* Under the Moslems law was merely the will of the emperor
or</p>
<p>sultan; under the Hindu kings it was a confused mixture of royal com-
mands, village traditions and caste rules. Judgment was given by the
head of the family, the head of the village, the headmen of the caste,
the court of the guild, the governor of the province, the minister of
the king, or the king himself . 05 Litigation was brief, judgment swift;
lawyers came only with the British . 58 Torture was used under every
dynasty until abolished by Firoz Shah . 57 Death was the penalty for any
of a great vari- ety of crimes, such as housebreaking, damage to royal
property, or theft on a scale that would now make a man a very pillar of
society. Punish- ments were cruel, and included amputation of hands,
feet, nose or ears, tearing out of eyes, pouring molten lead into the
throat, crushing the bones of hands and feet with a mallet, burning the
body with fire, driv- ing nails into the hands, feet or bosom, cutting
the sinews, sawing men asunder, quartering them, impaling them, roasting
them alive, letting them be trampled to death by elephants, or giving
them to wild and hungry dogs. 58 ’ 1 ’</p>
<p>No code of laws applied to all India. In the ordinary affairs of
life</p>
<p>the place of law was taken by the dhanna-shastras — metrical
textbooks of caste regulations and duties, composed by the Brahmans from
a strictly</p>
<ul>
<li>The story of how Nasiru-d-din poisoned his father Ghiyasu-d-din,
Sultan of Delhi (1501), illustrates the Moslem conception of peaceable
succession. Jehangir, who did his best to depose his father Akbar, tells
the story:</li>
</ul>
<p>“After this I went to the building containing the tombs of the Khalji
rulers. The grave of Nasiru-d-din, whose face is blackened forever, was
also there. It is well known that that wretch advanced himself by the
murder of his father. Twice he gave him poison, and the father twice
expelled it by means of a poison-antidote amulet he had on his arm. The
third time the son mixed poison in a cup of sherbet and gave it to his
father with his own hand. … As his father understood what efforts the
son was making in this matter, he loosened the amulet from his arm and
threw it before him; and then, turning his face in humility and
supplication towards the throne of the Creator, said: ‘O Lord, my age
has arrived at eighty years, and I have passed this time in prosperity
and happi- ness such as has been attained by no king. Now as this is my
last time, I hope that thou wilt not seize Nasir for my murder, and
that, reckoning my death as a thing decreed, thou wilt not avenge it.’
After he had spoken these words, he drank off that poisoned cup of
sherbet at a gulp, and delivered his soul to his Creator.</p>
<p>“When I went to his (Nasir’s) tomb,” adds the virtuous Jehangir, “I
gave it several kicks.” 54</p>
<p>t Still more sadistic refinements of penology may be found in Dubois,
p. 659.</p>
<p>484 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Brahman point of view. The oldest of these is the so- called “Code of
Manu.” Manu was the mythical ancestor of the Manava tribe (or school) of
Brahmans near Delhi; he was represented as the son of a god, and as
receiving his laws from Brahma himself.“ This code of 2685 verses, once
assigned to 1200 b.c., is now referred vaguely to the first centuries of
our era.“ Originally intended as a handbook or guide to proper caste
behavior for these Manava Brahmans, it was gradually accepted as a code
of conduct by the entire Hindu community; and though never recognized by
the Moslem kings it acquired, within the caste system, all the force of
law. Its character will appear to some extent in the course of the
follow- ing analysis of Hindu society and morals. In general it was
marked by a superstitious acceptance of trial by ordeal,* a severe
application of the lex talionis, and an untiring inculcation of the
virtues, rights and powers of the Brahman caste. 03 Its effect was to
strengthen enormously the hold of the caste system upon Hindu
society.</p>
<p>This system had grown more rigid and complex since the Vedic period;
not only because it is in the nature of institutions to become stiff
with age, but because the instability of the political order, and the
overrunning of India by alien peoples and creeds, had intensified caste
as a barrier to the mixture of Moslem and Hindu blood. In Vedic days
caste had</p>
<p>been varna, or color; in medieval India it became jati, or birth. Its
essence was twofold: the heredity of status, and the acceptance of
dharma — i.e., the traditional duties and employments of one’s native
caste.</p>
<p>The head and chief beneficiaries of the system were the eight million
males of the Brahman caste.“ Weakened for a while by the rise of</p>
<p>Buddhism under Ashoka, the Brahmans, with that patient tenacity which
characterizes priesthoods, had bided their time, and had recaptured
power and leadership under the Gupta line. From the second century a.d.
we fin d records of great gifts, usually of land, to the Brahman caste.
05 ! These grants, like all Brahman property, were exempt from taxation
until the</p>
<ul>
<li>Pere Dubois, who, though unsympathetic to India, is usually
truthful, gives us a pic- ture of the ordeals used in his time (1820).
“There are,” he says, “several other kinds of trial by ordeal. Amongst
the number is that of boiling oil which is mixed with cow-dung, and into
which the accused must plunge his arm up to the elbow; and that of the
snake, which consists in shutting up some very poisonous snake in a
basket in which has been placed a ring or a piece of money which the
accused must find and bring out with his eyes bandaged; if in the former
case he is not scalded, and in the latter case is not bitten, his
innocence is comp letely proved.” 82</li>
</ul>
<p>fTod believes that some of these charters were pious frauds.® 8</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 485</p>
<p>British came.“ 4 The Code of Manu warns the king never to tax a
Brahman, even when all other sources of revenue have failed; for a
Brahman pro- voked to anger can instantly destroy the king and all his
army by reciting curses and mystical texts.“ It was not the custom of
Hindus to make wills, since their traditions required that the property
of the family should be held in common, and automatically descend from
the dying to the sur- viving males; 08 * but when, under the influence
of European individualism, wills were introduced, they were greatly
favored by the Brahmans, as an occasional means of securing property for
ecc lesiastical purposes.’ 0 The most important element in any sacrifice
to the gods was the fee paid to the ministrant priest; the highest
summit of piety was largesse in such fees. 71 Miracles and a thousand
superstitions were another fertile source of sacerdotal wealth. For a
consideration a Brahman might render a bar- ren woman fecund; oracles
were manipulated for financial ends; men were engaged to feign madness
and to confess that their fate was a punish- ment for parsimony to the
priests. In every illness, lawsuit, bad omen, unpleasant dream or new
enterprise the advice of a Brahman was desir- able, and the adviser was
worthy of his hire.”</p>
<p>The power of the Brahmans was based upon a monopoly of knowledge.
They were the custodians and remakers of tradition, the educators of
children, the composers or editors of literature, the experts versed in
the inspired and infallible Vedas. If a Shudra listened to the reading
of the Scriptures his ears (according to the Brahmanical law books) were
to be filled with molten lead; if he recited it his tongue was to be
split; if he committed it to memory he was to be cut in two;’ 8 such
were the threats, seldom enforced, with which the priests guarded their
wisdom. Brahman- ism thus became an exclusive cult, carefully hedged
around against all vulgar participation.’ 8 According to the Code of
Manu a Brahman was by divine right at the head of all creatures;’ 8 he
did not, however, share in all the powers and privileges of the order
until, after many years of prep- aration, he was made “twice - born” or
regenerate by solemn investiture with the triple cord.” From that moment
he became a holy being; his person and property were inviolate; indeed,
according to Manu, “all that exists in this universe is the Brahman’s
property.’” 8 Brahmans were to be maintained by public and private gifts
— not as charity, but as a sacred obligation;” hospitality to a Brahman

<p>ligious duties, and a Brahman not hospitably received could walk away
with all the accumulated merits of the householder’s good deeds. 80 *
Even if a Brahman committed every crime, he was not to be killed; the
king might exile him, but must allow him to keep his property.” He who
tried to strike a Brahman would suffer in hell for a hundred years; he
who actually struck a Brahman would suffer in hell for a thousand years
. 85 If a Shudra debauched the wi fe of a Brahman, the Shudra’s property
was to be confiscated, and his genitals were to be cut off . 85 A Shudra
who killed a Shudra might atone for his crime by giving ten cows to
the</p>
<p>Brahmans; if he killed a Vaisya, he must give the Brahmans a hundred
cows; if he killed a Kshatriya, he must give the Brahmans a thousand
cows; if he killed a Brahman he must die; only the murder of a Brahman
was really murder.“</p>
<p>The functions and obligations that corresponded to these privileges
were numerous and burdensome. The Brahman not only acted as priest, t
but trained himself for the clerical, pedagogical and literary
professions. He was required to study law and learn the Vedas; every
other duty was subordinate to this ; 80 even to repeat the Vedas
entitled the Brahman to beatitude, regardless of rites or works;” and if
he memorized the Rig -Veda he might destroy the world without incurring
any guilt.” He must not marry outside his caste; if he married a Shudra
his children were to be pariahs;^ for, said Manu, “the man who is good
by birth becomes low by low associations, but the man who is low by
birth cannot become high by high associations .” 05 The Brahman had to
bathe every day, and again after being shaved by a barber of low caste;
he had to purify with cow- dung the place where he intended to sleep;
and he had to follow a strict hygienic ritual in attending to the duties
of nature . 03 He was to abstain from all animal food, including eggs,
and from onions, garlic, mushrooms and leeks. He was to drink nothing
but water, and it must have been drawn and carried by a Brahman.” He was
to abstain from unguents, perfumes, sensual pleasure, coveteousness, and
wrath.” If he touched an unclean</p>

<p>thing, or the person of any foreigner (even the Governor-General of
India), he was to purify himself by ceremonial ablutions. If he
committed a crime he had to accept a heavier punishment than would fall
upon a lower caste: if, for example, a Shudra stole he was to be fined
eightfold the sum or value of his theft; if a Vaisya stole he was to be
fined sixteen- fold; a Kshatriya, thirty-twofold; a Brahman, sixty-
fourfold.” The</p>
<p>Brahman was never to injure any living thing.”</p>
<p>Given a moderate observation of these rules, and a people too
burdened with the tillage of the fields, and therefore too subject to
the apparently personal whims of the elements, to rise out of
superstition to education, the power of the priests grew from generation
to generation, and made them the most enduring aristocracy in history.
Nowhere else can we find this astonishing phenomenon — so typical of the
slow rate of change in India — of an upper class maintaining its
ascendancy and privileges through all conquests, dynasties and
governments for 2500 years. Only the outcast Chandalas can rival them in
perpetuity. The ancient Ksha- triyas who had dominated the intellectual
as well as the political field in the days of Buddha disappeared after
the Gupta age; and though the Brahmans recognized the Rajput warriors as
the later equivalent of the old fighting caste, the Kshatriyas, after
the fall of Rajputana, soon be- came extinct. At last only two great
divisions remained: the Brahmans as the social and mental rulers of
India, and beneath them three thousand castes that were in reality
industrial guilds.*</p>
<p>Much can be said in defense of what, after monogamy, must be the most
abused of all social institutions. The caste system had the eugenic
value of keeping the presumably finer strains from dilution and
disappear- ance through indiscriminate mixture; it established certain
habits of diet and cleanliness as a rule of honor which all might
observe and emulate; it gave order to the chaotic inequalities and
differences of men, and spared the soul the modern fever of climbing and
gain; it gave order to every life by prescribing for each man a dharma,
or code of conduct for his caste; it gave order to every trade and
profession, elevated every occupa- tion into a vocation not lightly to
be changed, and, by making every in- dustry a caste, provided its
members with a means of united action</p>
<p>against exploitation and tyranny. It offered an escape from the
plutoc- racy or the military dictatorship which are apparently the only
alterna- On the caste system in our time cf. Chap, xxii. Sect, iv,

<p>tives to aristocracy; it gave to a country shorn of political
stability by a hundred invasions and revolutions a social, moral and
cultural order and continuity rivaled only by the Chinese. Amid a
hundred anarchic changes in the state, the Brahmans maintained, through
the system of caste, a stable society, and preserved, augmented and
transmitted civili- zation. The nation bore with them patiently, even
proudly, because every one knew that in the end they were the one
indispensable government of India.</p>

<p>“Dharma” — Children — Child marriage — The art of love — Prosti-</p>

<p>Her intellectual life — Her rights — “ Purdah ” — Suttee —</p>
<p>The Widow</p>
<p>When the caste system dies the moral life of India will undergo a</p>
<p>long transition of disorder, for there the moral code has been bound
up almost inseparably with caste. Morality was dharma — the rule of life
for each man as determined by his caste. To be a Hindu meant not so much
to accept a creed as to take a place in the caste system, and to accept
the dharma or duties attaching to that place by ancient tradition and
reg- ulation. Each post had its obligations, its limitations and its
rights; with them and within them the pious Hindu would lead his life,
finding in them a certain contentment of routine, and never thinking of
stepping into another caste. “Better thine own work is, though done with
fault,” said the Bhagavad- Gita “than doing others’ work, even
excellently.”</p>
<p>Dharma is to the individual what its normal development is to a seed
— the orderly fulfilment of an inherent nature and destiny . 88 So old
is this conception of morality that even today it is difficult for all,
and impos- sible for most, Hindus to think of themselves except as
members of a spe- cific caste, guided and bound by its rule. “Without
caste,” says an</p>
<p>English historian, “Hindu society is inconceivable .” 188</p>
<p>In addition to the dharma of each caste the Hindu recognized a gen-
eral dharma or obligation affecting all castes, and embracing chiefly
re- spect for Brahmans, and reverence for cows . 181 Next to these
duties was that of bearing children. “Then only is a man a perfect man,”
says</p>
<p>Manu’s code , 188 “when he is three— himself, his wife, and his son.”
Not only would children be economic assets to their parents, and support
them as a matter of course in old age, but they would carry on the
household</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 489</p>
<p>worship of their ancestors, and would offer to them periodically the
food without which these ghosts would starve. 1 “ Consequently there was
no birth control in India, and abortion was branded as a crime equal to
the murder of a Brahman. 1 “ Infanticide occurred , 106 but it was
exceptional; the father was glad to have children, and proud to have
many. The ten- derness of the old to the young is one of the fairest
aspects of Hindu civilization . 100</p>
<p>The child was hardly bom when the parents began to think of its</p>
<p>marriage. For marriage, in the Hindu system, was compulsory; an un-
married man was an outcast, without social status or consideration, and
prolonged virginity was a disgrace. 1 “ Nor was marriage to be left to
the whim of individual choice or romantic love; it was a vital concern
of</p>
<p>society and the race, and could not safely be entrusted to the myopia
of passion or the accidents of proximity ; 100 it must be arranged by
the par- ents before the fever of sex should have time to precipitate a
union doomed, in the Hindu view, to disillusionment and bitterness. Manu
gave the name of Gandharva marriage to unions by mutual choice, and
stigma- tized them as boin of desire; they were permissible, but hardly
respectable.</p>
<p>The early maturity of the Hindu, making a girl of twelve as old as
a</p>
<p>girl of fourteen or fifteen in America, created a difficult problem
of moral and social order.* Should marriage be arranged to coincide with
sexual maturity, or should it be postponed, as in America, until the
male arrives at economic maturity? The first solution apparently weakens
the na- tional physique , 110 unduly accelerates the growth of
population, and sac- rifices the woman almost completely to
reproduction; the second solution leaves the problems of unnatural
delay, sexual frustration, prostitution, and venereal disease. The
Hindus chose child marriage as the lesser evil, and tried to mitigate
its dangers by establishing, between the marriage and its consummation,
a period in which the bride should remain with her parents until the
coming of puberty . 111 The institution was old, and therefore holy; it
had been rooted in the desire to prevent intercaste mar- riage through
casual sexual attraction ; 113 it was later encouraged by the fact that
the conquering and otherwise ruthless Moslems were restrained</p>
<p>• It should be added that Gandhi denies that this precocity has any
physical basis. “I loathe and detest child marriage,” he writes. “I
shudder to see a child widow. I have never known a grosser superstition
than that the Indian climate causes sexual precocity. What does bring
about untimely puberty is the mental and moral atmosphere surrounding
family life .” 109</p>

<p>by their religion from carrying away married women as slaves; 5 “ and
finally it took rigid form in the parental resolve to protect the girl
from the erotic sensibilities of the male.</p>
<p>That these were reasonably keen, and that the male might be trusted
to attend to his biological functions on the slightest provocation,
appears from the Hindu literature of love. The Kamasutra, or “Doctrine
of</p>
<p>Desire,” is the most famous in a long list of works revealing a
certain pre - occupation with the physical and mental technique of sex.
It was com- posed, the author assures us, “accor ding to the precepts of
Holy Writ, for the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading
the life of a religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the
contemplation of the Deity.” 111 “He who neglects a girl, thinking she
is too bashful,” s ays this anchorite, “is despised by her as a beast
ignorant of the working of the female mind.” 1 “ Vatsyayana gives a
delightful picture of a girl in love, 110 but his wisdom is lavished
chiefly upon the parental art of getting her married away, and the
husbandly art of keeping her physically</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p>We must not presume that the sexual sensitivity of the Hindu led</p>
<p>to any unusual license. Child marriage raised a barrier against
premarital relations, and the strong religious sanctions used in the
inculcation of wifely fidelity made adultery far more difficult and rare
than in Europe or America. Prostitution was for the most part confined
to the temples. In the south the needs of the esurient male were met by
the providential institution of devadasis — literally “servants of the
gods,” actually prosti - tutes. Each Tamil temple had a troop of “sacred
women,” engaged at first to dance and sing before the idols, and perhaps
to entertain the Brahmans. Some of them seem to have lived lives of
almost conventual seclusion; others were allowed to extend their
services to all who could pay, on condition that a part of their
earnings should be contributed to the clergy. Many of these temple
courtesans, or nautch* girls, provided danc- ing and singing in public
functions and private gatherings, in the style of the geishas of Japan;
some of them learned to read, and, like the hetairai of Greece,
furnished cultured conversation in homes where the married women were
neither encouraged to read nor allowed to mingle with guests. In 1004
a.d., as a sacred inscription informs us, the temple of the Chola King
Rajaraja at Tanjore had four hundred devadasis. The custom</p>

<p>acquired the sanctity of time, and no one seems to have considered it
im- moral; respectable women now and then dedicated a daughter to the
pro- fession of temple prostitute in much the same spirit in which a son
might be dedicated to the priesthood.” Dubois , at the beginning of the
nine- teenth century, described the temples of the south as in some
cases “con - verted into mere brothels”; the devadasis, whatever their
original func - tions, were frankly called harlots by the public, and
were used as such. If we may believe the old abbe, who had no reason to
be prejudiced in favor of India,</p>
<p>their official duties consist in dancing and singing within the</p>
<p>temples twice a day, . . . and also at all public ceremonies. The</p>
<p>first they execute with sufficient grace, although their attitudes
are</p>
<p>lascivious and their gestures indecorous. As regards their
singing,</p>
<p>it is almost always confined to obscene verses describing some licen-
tious episode in the history of their gods.”</p>
<p>Under these circumstances of temple prostitution and child marriage
little opportunity was given for what we call “romantic love.” This
ideal - istic devotion of one sex to the other appears in Indian
literature — for ex- ample in the poems of Chandi Das and Jayadeva — but
usually as a symbol of the soul surrendering to God; while in actual
life it took most often the form of the complete devotion of the wife to
her mate. The love poetry is sometimes of the ethereal type depicted by
the Tennysons and Longfellows of our Puritan tradition; sometimes it is
the full-bodied and sensuous passion of the Elizabethan stage.” One
writer unites religion and love, and sees in either ecstasy a
recognition of identity; another lists the three hundred and sixty
different emotions that fill the l over’s heart, and counts the patterns
which his teeth have left on his beloved’s flesh, or shows him
decorating her breasts with painted flowers of sandal</p>
<p>paste; and the author of the Nala and Damayanti episode in the Mahab-
harata describes the melancholy sighs and pale dyspepsia of the lovers
in the best style of the French troubadours . 120</p>
<p>Such whimsical passions were seldom permitted to determine marriage
in India. Manu allowed eight different forms of marriage, in which mar-
riage by capture and marriage “from affection” were ranked lowest in the
moral scale, and marriage by purchase was accepted as the sensible way
of arranging a union; in the long run, the Hindu legislator thought,</p>
<p>49 2 the story of civilization (chap. XVII</p>
<p>those marriages are most soundly based that rest upon an economic
foundation . 131 In the days of Dubois “to marry” and “to buy a wife”
were</p>
<p>The Hindu family was typically patriarchal, with the father full
mas-</p>
<p>ter of his wife, his children, and his slaves . 131 Woman was a
lovely but inferior being. In the beginning, says Hindu legend, when
Twashtri, the Divine Artificer, came to the creation of woman he found
that he had ex- hausted his materials in the making of man, and had no
solid elements left. In this dilemma he fashioned her eclectically out
of the odds and ends of creation:</p>
<p>He took the rotundity of the moon, and the curves of creepers,</p>
<p>and the clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of grass, and the</p>
<p>slenderness of the reed, and the bloom of flowers, and the lightness
of leaves, and the tapering of the elephant’s trunk, and the glances</p>
<p>of deer, and the clustering of rows of bees, and the joyous
gaiety</p>
<p>of sunbeams, and the weeping of clouds, and the fickleness of the</p>
<p>winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the vanity of the
peacock,</p>
<p>and the softness of the parrot’s bosom, and the hardness of adamant,
and the sweetness of honey, and the cruelty of the tiger, and the</p>
<p>warm glow of fire, and the coldness of snow, and the chattering
of</p>
<p>jays, and the cooing of the kokila, and the hypocrisy of the
crane,</p>
<p>and the fidelity of the chakravaka ; and compounding all these
to-</p>
<p>gether he made woman, and gave her to man. 13 “</p>
<ul>
<li>Strabo (ca. 20 a.d.) , relying on Aristobulus, describes “some novel
and unusual cus - toms at Taxila: those who by reason of poverty are
unable to marry off their daughters, lead them forth to the market place
in the power of their age to the sound of both trumpets and drums
(precisely the instruments used to signal the call to battle), thus
assembling a crowd; and to any man who comes forward they first expose
her rear parts up to the shoulders, and then her front parts, and if she
pleases him, and at the same time allows herself to be persuaded, on
approved terms, he marries her .” 128 t Among the Rajputs, if we may
believe Tod, it was usual for the prince to have different wives for
each day of the week . 135</li>

<p>Nevertheless, despite all this equipment, woman fared poorly in
India. Her high status in Vedic days was lost under priestly influence
and</p>
<p>Mohammedan example. The Code of Manu set the tone against her in
phrases reminiscent of an early stage in Christian theology: “The sour
ce of dishonor is woman; the source of strife is woman; the source
of</p>
<p>earthly existence is woman; therefore avoid woman .” 1 * 1 “A
female,” says another passage, “is able to draw from the right path in
this life not a fool only but even a sage, and can lead him in
subjection to desire or to</p>
<p>wrath.” m The law laid it down that all through her life woman should
be in tutelage, first to her father, then to her husband, and finally to
her son . 132 The wife addressed her husband humbly as “master,” “lord,”
even as “my god”; in public she walked some distance behind him, and
seldom received a word from him . 138 She was expected to show her
devotion by the most minute service, preparing the meals, eating — after
they had fin- ished — the food left by her husband and her sons, and
embracing her hus- band’s feet at bedtime. 13 * “A faithful wife,” said
Manu, “must serve . . . her lord as if he were a god, and never do aught
to pain him, whatso- ever be his state, and even though devoid of every
virtue .” 133 A wife who disobeyed her husband would become a jackal in
her next incar-</p>

<p>nation.</p>
<p>Like their sisters in Europe and America before our own times,
the</p>
<p>women of India received education only if they were ladies of
high</p>
<p>degree, or temple prostitutes . 137 The art of reading was considered
inap- propriate in a woman; her power over men could not be increased by
it, and her attractiveness would be diminished. Says Chitra in
Tagore’s</p>
<p>play: “When a woman is merely a woman— when she winds herself round
and round men’s hearts with her smiles and sobs and services and
caressing endearments — then she is happy. Of what use to her are
learning and great achievements ?” 133 Knowledge of the Vedas was denied
to her ; 130 “for a woman to study the Vedas” says the Mahabharata, “is
a sign of confusion in the realm.” 1 “* Megasthenes reported, in
Chandragupta’s days, that “the Brahmans keep their wives— and they have
many wives — ignorant of all philosophy; for if women learned to look
upon pleasure and pain, life and death, philosophically, they would
become depraved, or else no longer remain in subjection .” 141</p>
<ul>
<li>We must compare this attitude not with our contemporary European or
American views, but with the reluctance of the medieval clergy to allow
a general reading of the Bible, or the intellectual education of
woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>494</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>In the Code of Manu three persons were ineligible to hold property: a
wife, a son, and a slave; whatever these might earn became the prop-
erty of their master . 113 A wife, however, could retain as her own the
dowry and gifts that she had received at her nuptials; and the mother of
a prince might govern in his stead during his minority . 143 The husband
could divorce his wife for unchastity; the woman could not divorce her
husband for any cause . 144 A wife who drank liquor, or was diseased, or
rebellious, or wasteful, or quarrelsome, might at any time be (not
divorced but) superseded by another wife. Passages of the Code advocate
an en- lightened gentleness to women: they are not to be struck “even
with a flower”; they are not to be watched too strictly, for then their
subtlety will find a way to mischief; and if they like fine raiment -it
is wise to in- dulge the m, for “if the wife be not elegantly attired,
she will not ex - hilarate her husband,” whereas when “a wife is gaily
adorned, the whole house is embellished .” 146 Way must be made for a
woman, as for the aged or a priest; and “pregnant women, brides, an d
damsels shall have food before all other guests .” 146 Though woman
could not rule as a wife, she might rule as a mother; the greatest
tenderness and respect was paid to the mother of many children; and even
the patriarchal code of Manu said, “The mother exceedeth a thousand
fathers in the right to reverence .” 147</p>
<p>Doubtless the influx of Islamic ideas had something to do with
the</p>
<p>decline in the status of woman in India after Vedic days. The custom
of purdah (curtain) — the seclusion of married women — came into India
with the Persians and the Mohammedans, and has therefore been stronger
in the north than in the south. Partly to protect their wives from the
Moslems, Hindu husbands developed a system of purdah so rigid that a
respectable woman could show herself only to her husband and her sons,
and could move in public only under a heavy veil; even the doctor who
treated her and took her pulse had to do so through a curtain . 146 In
some circles it was a breach of good manners to inquire after a man’s
wife, or to speak, as a guest, to the ladies of the house . 140</p>
<p>The custom of burning widows on their husbands’ pyres was also an
importation into India. Herodotus describes it as practised by the
ancient Scythians and Thracians; if we may believe him, the wives of a
Thracian fought for the privilege of being slain over his grave . 160
Probably the rite came down from the almost world-wide primitive usage
of immolating one or more of the wives or concubines of a prince or rich
man, along with slaves and other perquisites, tc take care of him in the
Beyond . 161 The</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 495</p>
<p>Atharva-veda speaks of it as an old custom, but the Rig-veda
indicates that in Vedic days it had been softened to the requirement
that the widow should lie on her husband’s pyre for a moment before his
cremation . 152 The Mahabharata shows the institution restored and
unrepentant; it gives several examples of suttee,* and lays down the
rule that the chaste widow does not wish to survive her husband, but
enters proudly into the lire . 122 The sacrifice was effected by burning
the wife in a pit, or, among the Telugus in the south, by burying her
alive . 151 Strabo reports that suttee prevailed in India in the time of
Alexander, and that the Kathaei, a Punjab tribe, had made suttee a law
in order to prevent wives from poisoning their husbands . 125 Manu makes
no mention of the practice. The Brahmans opposed it at first, then
accepted it, and finally lent it a religious sanc- tion by interpreting
it as bound up with the eternity of marriage: a woman once married to a
man remained his forever, and would be rejoined to him in his later
lives . 155 In Rajasthan the absolute possession of the wife by the
husband took the form of the johur, in which a Rajput, fac- ing certain
defeat, immolated his wives before advancing to his own death in battle
. 157 The usage was widespread under the Moguls, despite Moslem
abhorrence; and even the powerful Akbar failed to dislodge it. On one
occasion Akbar himself tried to dissuade a Hindu bride who</p>
<p>wished to be burned on the pyre of her dead betrothed; but though the
Brahmans added their pleas to the king’s, she insisted on the sacrifice;
as the flames reached her, and Akbar’s son Daniyal con tinued to argue
with her, she replied, “Do not annoy, do not annoy.” Another widow, re -
jecting similar pleas, held her finger in the flame of a lamp until
the</p>
<p>finger was completely burned; giving no sign of pain, she indicated
in this way her scorn of those who advised her to refuse the rite . 155
In Vijayanagar suttee sometimes took a wholesale form; not one or a few
but all of the many wives of a prince or a captain followed him to
death. Conti reports that the Raya or King had selected three thousand
of his twelve thousand wives as favorites, “on condition that at his
death they should voluntarily burn themselves with him, which is
considered to be a great honor for them .” 159 It is difficult to say
how thoroughly the medieval Hindu widow was reconciled to suttee by
religious inculcation and belief, and the hope of reunion with her
husband in another life.</p>
<p>Suttee became less and less popular as India developed contacts
with</p>
<p>More properly sati, pronounced suttee , and meaning “devoted
wife.”</p>

<p>Europe; but the Hindu widow continued to suffer many
disabilities.</p>
<p>Since marriage bound a woman eternally to her husband, her remarriage
after his death was a mortal offense, and was bound to create confusion
in his later existences. The widow was therefore required by Brahman-
ical law to remain unmarried, to shave her head, and live out her life
(if she did not prefer suttee) in the care of her children and in acts
of private charity.”“ She was n ot left destitute; on the contrary she
had a first lien on her husband’s estate for her maintenance. 1 “ These
rules were followed only by the orthodox women of the middle and upper
classes — i.e., by some thirty per cent of the population; they were
ignored by Moslems, Sikhs, and the lower castes. 1 ” Hindu opinion
likened this second virginity of the widow to the celibacy of nuns in
Christendom; in either case</p>
<p>some women renounced marriage, and were set aside for charitable
ministrations.*</p>

by sex in Occidental conversation and wit was quite alien to Hindu
manners, which forbade any public intimacy between men and women, and
looked upon the physical contact of the sexes in dancing as improper and
obscene . 1 “ 6 A Hindu woman might go anywhere in public without fear
of molestation or insult; 1 ““ indeed the</p>

<li>In considering alien customs we must continually remind ourselves
that foreign prac- tices cannot be judged intelligently by our own moral
code. “The superficial o bserver who applies his own standard to the
customs of all nations,” says Tod, “laments with affected philanthropy
the degraded condition of the Hindu female, in which sentiment he would
find her little disposed to join him .” 163 On contemporary change s in
these customs cf. Chapter XXII below.</li>

<p>risk, as the Oriental saw the matter, was all on the other side. Manu
warns men: “Woman is by nature ever inclined to tempt man; hence a man
should not sit in a secl uded place even with his nearest female
relative”; and he must never look higher than the ankles of a passing
girl. 1 ”</p>
<p>Cleanliness was literally next to godliness in India; hygiene was
not,</p>
<p>as Anatole France thought it, la seule morale, but it was made an
essential part of piety. Manu laid down, many centuries ago, an exacting
code of physical refinement. “Early in the morning,” one instruction
reads, “let him” (the Brahman) “bathe, decorate his body, clean his
teeth, apply collyrium to his eyes, an d worship the gods.” 1 ” The
native schools made good manners and personal cleanliness the first
courses in the curriculum. Every day the caste Hindu would bathe his
body, and wash the simple robe he was to wear; it seemed to him
abominable to use the same gar- ment, unwashed, for more than a day. 1 “
“The Hindus,” said Sir William Huber, “stand out as examples of bodily
cleanliness among Asiatic races, and, we may add, among the races of the
world. The ablutions of the Hindu have passed into a prove rb.” 170
*</p>
<p>Yuan Chwang, 1300 years ago, described thus the eating habits of the
Hindus:</p>
<p>They are pure of themselves, and not from compulsion. Before</p>
<p>every meal they must have a wash; the fragments and remains are</p>
<p>not served up again; the food utensils are not passed on; those which
are of pottery or of wood must be thrown away after use, and those which
are of gold, silver, copper or iron get another polishing.</p>
<p>As soon as a meal is over they chew the tooth-stick and make them-
selves clean. Before they have finished ablutions they do not come</p>
<p>in contact with each other. 1 ”</p>
<p>The Brahman usually washed his hands, feet and teeth before and after
each meal; he ate with his fingers from food on a leaf, and thought it
un- clean to use twice a plate, a knife or a fork; and when finished he
rinsed his mouth seven times. 170 The toothbrush was always new — a twig
freshly plucked from a tree; to the Hindu it seemed disreputable to
brush the teeth with the hair of an animal, or to use the same brush
twice: 174 so many are the ways in which men may scorn one another. The
Hindu</p>
<p>*A great Hindu, Lajpat Rai, reminded Europe that “long before the
European nations knew anything of hygiene, and long before they realized
the value of tooth-brush and a daily bath, the Hindus were, as a rule,
given to both. Only twenty years ago London houses had no bath-tubs, and
the tooth- brush was a luxury .” 171</p>
<p>498 the story of civilization (chap. XVII</p>
<p>chewed almost incessantly the leaf of the betel plant, which
blackened the teeth in a manner disagreeable to Europeans, and agreeable
to himself. This and the occasional use of opium consoled him for his
usual abstention from tobacco and intoxicating drinks.</p>
<p>Hindu law books give explicit rules for menstrual hygiene , 175 and
for meet- ing the demands of nature. Nothing could exceed in complexity
or solemnity the ritual for Brahman defecation . 176 The Twice-born must
use only his left hand in this rite, and must cleanse the parts with
water; and he con- sidered his house defiled by the very presence of
Europeans who contented themselves with paper . 177 The Outcastes,
however, and many Shudras, were less particular, and might turn any
roadside into a privy . 178 In the quarters occupied by these classes
public sanitation was confined to an open sewer line in the middle of
the street . 170</p>
<p>In so warm a climate clothing was a superfluity, and beggars and
saints bridged the social scale in agreeing to do without it. One
southern caste, like the Canadian Doukhobors, threatened to migrate if
its members were compelled to wear clothing . 180 Until the late
eighteenth century it was probably the custom in southern India (as
still in Bali) for both sexes to go naked above the waist . 181 Children
were dressed for the most part in beads and rings. Most of the
population went barefoot; if the orthodox Hindu wore shoes they had to
be of cloth, for under no circumstances would he use shoes of leather. A
large number of the men contented themselves with loin cloths; when they
needed more covering they bound some fabric about the waist, and threw
the loose end over the left shoulder. The Rajputs wore trousers of every
color and shape, with a tunic girdled by a ceinture , a scarf at the
neck, sandals or boots on the feet, and a turban on the head. The turban
had come in with the Moslems, and had been taken over by the Hindus, who
wound it carefully around the head in varying manner ac- cording to
caste, but always with the generosity of a magician unfurling endless
silk; sometimes one turban, unraveled, reached a length of seventy feet
. 182 The women wore a flowing robe — colorful silk sari, or homespun
khaddar — which passed over both shoulders, clasped the waist tightly,
and then fell to the feet; often a few inches of bronze flesh were left
bare below the breast. Hair was oiled to guard it against the
desiccating sun; men di- vided theirs in the center and drew it together
into a tuft behind the left ear; women coiled a part of theirs upon
their heads, but let the rest hang free, often decorating it with
flowers, or covering it with a scarf. The men were handsome, the young
women were beautiful and all presented a mag- nificent carriage ; 183 an
ordinary Hindu in a loin cloth often had more dignity</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 499</p>
<p>than a European diplomat completely equipped. Pierre Loti thought it
“in - contestable that the beauty of the Aryan race reaches its highest
develop- ment of perfection and refinement among the upper class” in
India. 334 Both sexes were adept in cosmetics, and the women felt naked
without jewelry. A ring in the left nostril denoted marriage. On the
forehead, in most cases, was a painted symbol of religious faith.</p>
<p>It is difficult to go below these surface appearances and describe
the character of the Hindus, for every people harbors all virtues and
all vices, and witnesses tend to select such of these as will point
their moral and adorn their tale. “I think we may take as their greatest
vice,” says Pere D ubois, “the untrustworthiness, deceit and double
-dealing . . . which are common to all Hindus. . . . Certain it is that
there is no nation in the world which thinks so lightly of an oath or of
perjury.” 185 “Lying,” says Westermarck, “has been called the national
vice of the Hindus.” 180 “Hindus are wily and deceitful,” says Macaulay.
187 According to the laws of Manu and the prac - tice of the world a lie
told for good motives is forgivable; if, for example, the death of a
priest would result from speaking the truth, falsehood is justifiable.
188 But Yuan Chwang tells us: “They do not practice deceit, and they
keep their sworn obligations. . . . They will not take anything wrong-
fully, and they yield more than fairness requires.” 189 Abu -1 Fazl, not
preju- diced in favor of India, reports the Hindus of the sixteenth
century as “re - ligious, affable, cheerful, lovers of justice, given to
retirement, able in busi- ness, admirers of truth, grateful, and of
unbounded fidelity.” 100 “Their hon - esty ,” said honest Keir Hardie,
“is proverbial. They borrow and lend on word of mouth, and the
repudiation of a debt is almost unknown.” 101 “I have had before me,”
says a British judge in India, “hundreds of cases in which a man’s
property, liberty and lif e depended upon his telling a lie, and he has
refused to tell it.” 102 How shall we reconcile these conflicting tes -
timonies? Perhaps it is very simple: some Hindus are honest, and some
are not.</p>
<p>Again the Hindus are very cruel and gentle. The English language has
derived a short and ugly word from that strange secret society — almost
a caste — of Thugs which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
committed thousands of atrocious murders in order (they said) to offer
the victims as sacrifices to the goddess Kali. 193 Vincent Smith writes
of these Thugs (lit- erally, “cheats”) in terms not quite irrelevant to
our time:</p>
<p>The gangs had little to fear, and enjoyed almost complete im-</p>
<p>munity; . . . they always had powerful protectors. The moral</p>
<p>feeling of the people had sunk so low that there were no signs of</p>
<p>general reprehension of the cold-blooded crimes committed by the</p>
<p>JOO THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Thugs. They were accepted as part of the established order of</p>
<p>things; and until the secrets of the organization were given
away,</p>
<p>… it was usually impossible to obtain evidence against even the</p>
<p>most notorious Thugs . 1984</p>
<p>Nevertheless there is comparatively little crime in India, and little
vio- lence. By universal admission the Hindus are gentle to the point of
timid- ity ; 194 too worshipful and good-natured, too long broken upon
the wheel of conquest and alien despotisms, to be good fighters except
in the sense that they can bear pain with ilnequaled bravery . 195 Their
greatest faults are proba- bly listlessness and laziness; but in the
Hindus these are not faults but climatic necessities and adaptations,
like the dolce far niente of the Latin peoples, and the economic fever
of Americans. The Hindus are sensitive, emotional, temperamental,
imaginative; therefore they are better artists and poets than rulers or
executives. They can exploit their fellows with the same zest that
characterizes the entrepreneur everywhere; yet they are given to
limitless charity, and are the most hospitable hosts this side of
barbarism . 198 Even their enemies admit their courtesy , 197 and a
generous Britisher sums up his long experience by ascribing to the
higher classes in Calcutta “polished man - ners, clearness and
comprehensiveness of understanding, liberality of feeling, and
independence of principle, that would have stamped them gentlemen in any
country in the world .” 198</p>
<p>The Hindu genius, to an outsider, seems sombre, and doubtless the
Hindus have not had much cause for laughter. The dialogues of Buddha
indicate a great variety of games, including one that strangely
resembles chess; 199 *</p>
<ul>
<li>Chess is so old that half the nations of antiquity claim its
birthplace. The view gen- erally accepted by archeologists of the game
is that it arose in India; certainly we find there its oldest
indisputable appearance (ca. 750 a.d.). The word chess comes from the
Persian shah , king; and checkmate is originally shah-mat- “  ting
dead.” The Persians called it shatranj , and took both the word and the
game, through the Arabs, from India, where it was known as chaturanga,
or “four angles”— elephants, horses, chariots and foot- soldiers. The
Arabs still call the bishop al-fil- i.e., elephant (from aleph-hind,
Arabic for “ox of India”). 3500</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hindus tell a delightful legend to account for the origin of the
game. At the be- ginning of the fifth century of our era (the story
goes), a Hindu monarch offended his Brahman and Kshatriya admirers by
ignoring their counsels and forgetting that the love of the people is
the surest support of a throne. A Brahman, Sissa, undertook to open the
eyes of the young king by devising a game in which the piece that
represented the king, though highest in dignity and value (as in
Oriental war), should be, alone, almost helpless; hence came chess. The
ruler liked the game so well that he invited Sissa to name his reward.
Sissa modestly asked for some grains of rice, the quantity to be de-
termined by placing one grain upon the first of the sixty-four squares
of the chess-board, and then doubling the number of grains with each
succeeding square. The king agreed at</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE 501</p>
<p>but neither these nor their successors exhibit the vivacity and
joyousness of Western games. Akbar, in the sixteenth century, introduced
into India the game of polo,* which had apparently come from Persia and
was making its way across Tibet to China and Japan; 5 ” 3 and it pleased
him to play pachisi (the modern “parchesi”) on squares cut in the
pavement of the palace quadrangle at Agra, with pretty slave- girls as
living pieces.”*</p>
<p>Frequent religious festivals lent color to public life. Greatest of
all</p>
<p>was the Durga-Puja, in honor of the great goddess-mother Kali.
For</p>
<p>weeks before its approach the Hindus feasted and sang; but the
culminat- ing ceremonial was a procession in which every family carried
an image of the goddess to the Ganges, flung it into the river, and
returned home- ward with all merriness spent.® 1 * The Holi festival
celebrated in honor of the goddess Vasanti took on a Saturnalian
character: phallic emblems were carried in parade, and were made to
simulate the motions of coitus.“* In Chota Nagpur the harvest was the
signal for general license; “men set aside all conventions, women all
modesty, and complete liberty was given to the girls.” The Parganait, a
caste of peasants in the Rajmahal Hills, held an annual agricultural
festival in which the unmarried were allowed to indulge freely in
promiscuous relations.” * Doubtless we have here again relics of
vegetation magic, intended to promote the fertility of families and the
fields. More decorous were the wedding festivals that marked the great
event in the life of every Hindu; many a father brought himself to ruin
in providing a sumptuous feast for the marriage of his daughter or his
son .” 7</p>
<p>At the other end of life was the final ceremony — cremation. In
Buddha’s days the Zoroastrian exposure of the corpse to birds of prey
was the usual mode of departure; but persons of distinction were burned,
after death, on a pyre, and their ashes were buried under a tope or
stupa — i.e., a memorial shrine.”* In later days cremation became the
privilege of every</p>
<p>once, but was soon surprised to find that he had promised away his
kingdom. Sissa took the opportunity to point out to his master how
easily a monarch may be led astray when he scorns his counsellors. 201

<p>into the saving stream . 200 Suicide under certain conditions has
always found more approval in the East than in the West; it was
permitted under the laws of Akbar to the old or the incurably diseased,
and to those who wished to offer themselves as sacrifices to the gods.
Thousands of Hindus have made their last oblation by starving themselves
to death, or burying themselves in snow, or covering themselves with
cow-dung and setting it on fire, or allowing crocodiles to devour them
at the mouths of the Ganges. Among the Brahmans a form of hara-kiri
arose, by which suicide was committed to avenge an injury or point a
wrong. When one of the Rajput Icings levied a subsidy upon the priestly
caste, several of the</p>
<p>wealthiest Brahmans stabbed themselves to death in his presence,
laying upon him the supposedly most terrible and effective curse of all
— that of a dying priest. The Brahmanical lawbooks required that he who
had resolved to die by his own hand should fast for three days; and that
he who attempted suicide and failed should perform the severest penances
. 210 Life is a stage with one entrance, but many exits.</p>
