<p>The Spreading Campaign</p>
<p>1758-74</p>

</ol>
<p>T HE family was of Swiss-Germanic origin, like those virile stocks
that make Bern and Zurich proud and prosperous today. One member, in
Neuchatel, took the name Schweitzer — i.e., Swiss; another, who removed
to the Netherlands, bore the name Helvetius — i.e., Swiss. This second
branch moved to Paris about 1680. There Jean Claude Adrien Helvetius
became physician to Queen Marie Leszczynska. Of his twenty children the
one who here concerns us was born January 26, 1715. Claude Adrien was
reared in the odor of medicine, which left some trace in his philosophy.
After studying under the Jesuits at the College Louis-le-Grand he was
apprenticed to a tax collector. Soon he was rich; at the age of twenty-
three he had an income of 360,000 livres per year. 1 He was handsome, a
good fencer, dancer, and shot, a favorite with courtiers and courtesans.
He was appointed maitre d’hotel— master of the household — to the Queen.
He was thoroughly unprepared to become a philosopher — except of the
kind that is too clever to write books.</p>
<p>But in 1738 he met Voltaire, was awed by his mind and fame, and began
to dream of authorship; would it not be a novel distinction to be at
once a financier and a philosopher? He spent some time at Bordeaux as
the guest of Montesquieu, and then in Burgundy with Buffon; these were
formative influences. He became a close friend with another millionaire,
Baron d’Hol - bach, the archmaterialist of the age. At the Baron’s
dinners, and in the salon of Mme. de Grafligny, he met Diderot, Grimm,
Rousseau, Duel os, Galiani, Marmontel, Turgot. He was transformed.</p>
<p>In 1751 he made two fateful decisions. He abandoned his lucrative
post as a farmer general of taxes, retired to a feudal estate at
Vore-au-Perche, and devoted himself to writing a book that would move
the world. In the same year, aged thirty- six, he married Anne Catherine
de Ligniville d’Autri - court, a countess of the Holy Roman Empire, aged
thirty-two, one of the</p>
<p>680</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 68 1</p>
<p>most beautiful and accomplished women in France. He took her at once
to Vore, for fear, said Grimm, that Paris would tarnish her. There — or
was it in Paris? — Fontenelle, nearing one hundred, entered the dressing
room of the</p>
<p>The happy couple maintained also a house in Paris, and there
Helvetius’ hospitality, graced by his wife’s charms, drew to them such
intellectual lions as Diderot, d’Holbach, Fontenelle, Buffon,
d’Alembert, Turgot,</p>
<p>Galiani, Morellet, Condorcet, and Hume. “You should see,” said Marmon
- tel, “how agreeable his home became for literary men.” 3 At those
dinners Helvetius tried to guide the conversation to the themes on which
he planned to write; he invited criticism of his ideas, and showed
himself a good listener; Morellet complained that Helvetius “was always
composing his book in company.” 4</p>
<p>After seven years of incubation the beloved volume came forth, July
15, 1758, as De I’Esprit ( On Intelligence) . To the surprise of the
friends who had seen it in manuscript, it appeared with the precious
“privilege of the King.” Malesherbes had delegated to Jean Pierre
Tercier the task of censor- ing it; Tercier reported: “I have found
nothing in it which in my judg - ment ought to prevent its publication.”
5 On August 6 the advocate general of the Paris Parlement branded the
book a mass of heresies; on August 10 the Council of State revoked the
privilege to print; soon Tercier was ousted from his lucrative posts.
The amiable author protested that he had made no attack upon
Christianity. “O f what impiety can they accuse me? I have in no part of
this work denied the Trinity, or the divinity of Jesus, or the
immortality of the soul, or the resurrection of the dead, or any other
article of the papal creed; I have not therefore in any way attacked re-
ligion.” 6 Voltaire, fearing that Helvetius would be sent to the
Bastille, ad - vised him to travel. But Helvetius was too comfortable at
home to sacri- fice so much for a book. He issued a retraction in the
form of a letter to a priest; and when the government declared this
inadequate he signed an apology “so humiliating,” wrote Grimm, “that one
would not have been astonished to see a man take refuge with the
Hottentots rather than put his name to such avowals.” 7 Mme. Helvetius
came to Ver sailles to intercede for her husband; the government
contented itself with ordering him to re- tire to his estate for two
years. The penalty might have been more severe had not the King
remembered that his own life had once been saved by Helvetius’ fat her,
then physician to the Queen. On January 3, 1759, Pope Clement XIII
condemned the book as scandalous and licentious; and in February it was
publicly burned by order of the Parlement. We have seen how this “fuss
over an omelet,” as Voltaire called it, shared with d’Alem -</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>bert’s article on Geneva in leading to the suppression of the
Encyclopedic. With all this advertising De F Esprit became the most
widely read of all the volumes that played a part in the campaign
against Christianity. Twenty editions appeared in French within six
months, and it was soon translated into English and German. Today only a
few scholars know of it, and it is almost impossible to obtain.</p>
<p>Helvetius published no more, but he continued to write. Leisurely but
angrily he restated and amplified his views in the treatise De FHonmte (
On Man), which attacked priests as venal peddlers of hope and fear,
perpetu- ators of ignorance, and murderers of thought. In these two
books we find all the ideals of that ambitious time: liberty, equality,
and fraternity: liberty of speech, press, assembly, and worship,
equality for both sexes and all classes in educational opportunity and
before the law, and an almost social- istic advocacy of the “welfare
state” as a compensatory protection of the simple poor against the
clever rich — all capped with a semireligious faith in the indefinite
perfectibility of mankind. Here again, if we listen well, is the voice
of the Revolution.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Like nearly all the philo sophes, Helvetius begins with Locke: all
ideas are derived from sensation, therefore from the experience of the
individual. All mental states are combinations of sensations felt at
present, or revived from the past through memory, or projected into the
future through imagi- nation. Judgment is the sensation of differences
among sensations; and rea- son is a combination of judgments.</p>
<p>Mind and soul are not the same: mind is an assemblage or sequence of
mental states; soul is the sensitivity of the organism, the capacity to
receive sensations. All sensation is physical, all soul is a power in
matter. “All the phenomena of medicine and natural history evidently
prove that this power . . . begins with the formation of the bodily
organs, lasts as long as they last, and is destroyed with their
dissolution.” 8 Animals have souls. Man became superior to the beasts
through the development of upright stature, which gradually turned his
forefeet into hands capable of grasping (com-pre-hend- ing) and
manipulating objects.</p>
<p>Having begun with Locke, Helvetius proceeds with Hobbes. All action
is desire responding to sensations present or recalled. Desire is the
memory of the pleasure that attended certain sensations. Passion is a
persisting de- sire, and varies in intensity according to the pain or
pleasure remembered and expected. The passions often lead us into error
because they fix our attention upon some particular part of an object or
a situation, not allow-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>683</p>
<p>ing us to view it on every side . 9 (In this sense intelligence is
the delay of reaction to allow wider perception and fuller response.)
Nevertheless pas- sions are to character what motion is to matter; they
supply the drive, even the drive for knowledge. “The mental achievement
of a person varies with the intensity of his passions. The man of genius
is a man of strong pas- sions; the stupid man is devoid of them .” 10
The basic passion is love of power, and this is basic because it
enlarges our ability to realize our desires.</p>
<p>Up to this point Helvetius’ work deserved Voltaire’ s description of
it as an “omelet”— a mingling of ideas long current in the philosophical
world. But now he advanced to his most distinctive propositions. Since
all ideas come from the individual’s experiences, diversity in the ideas
and character</p>
<p>At the moment the child is delivered from the womb … he enters</p>
<p>life without ideas and without passions. The only one he feels is
that of hunger. It is not in the cradle 〔not from heredity〕 that we
received</p>
<p>the passions of pride, avarice, ambition, the desire for esteem
and</p>
<p>glory. These factious passions, generated amid towns and cities, pre-
suppose conventions and laws already established among men. . . .</p>
<p>Such passions would be unknown to him who was carried by a storm, at
the moment of his birth, to a desert waste, and, like Romulus,</p>
<p>nourished by a wolf. . . . The love of glory is an acquisition,
and</p>
<p>therefore the effect of instruction . 12</p>
<p>Even the genius is the product of environment — i.e., of experience
plus circumstance. The genius adds the last step in an invention to many
steps taken before him, and this final step is due to circumstance.
“Every new idea is the gift of chance”— i.e., to “a series of effects of
which we do not perceive the c ause .” 13</p>
<p>Whence proceeds the extreme inequality of understanding? Because
nobody perceives precisely the same objects, nor is precisely in the</p>
<p>same situation, nor has received the same education; and because</p>
<p>chance, which presides over our instruction, does not conduct all men
to mines equally rich and fruitful. It is therefore to education — taken
in the fullest extent that we can give to this term, and in which the
idea of chance is also included, that we are to refer the inequality of
under- standing . 14</p>
<p>684</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Probably this psychological analysis — especially generous in a
millionaire — was derived from a political attitude. Conservatives
stress the differences and influence of heredity, and the need for
caution in changing institutions rooted in natural and native
inequalities of ability and character. Reformers stress the differences
and influence of environment, by which inequalities of ability, power,
and wealth seem due to chance — to the accidents of birth and the
privileges of condition rather than to innate merit; inequality can
therefore be reduced by equalizing education and bettering the environ-
ment. Helvetius applies his theory of natural equality to races as well
as to individuals: all races would have reached equal development if
their en- vironmental opportunities had been equal. Consequently
national pride, like pride of person or class, has no warrant in
reality. “The liberty of which the English are so proud … is less the
reward of their courage than the gift of fortune”— i.e., of the
protective Channel and seas. (Internal liberty, other things equal,
varies inversely as external danger.)</p>
<p>Obviously, on these premises, the road of progress follows the
improve- ment of education, society, and government. “Education is
capable of ef - fecting everything”; does it not teach the bear to dance
? 15 All progress, even in morals, depends upon the spread of knowledge
and the training of intelligence; “destroy ignorance, and you will
destroy all the seeds of moral</p>
<p>Here Helvetius, while not denying any Christian dogma, enters upon a
passionate plea for the curtailment of ecclesiastical power in France.
He attacks the Church from a social rather than a theological
standpoint. He denounces the Catholic glorification of celibacy and
poverty, but rejoices that very few Christians take these ideas
seriously; “a secret incredulity fre - quently opposes the pernicious
effect of religious principles .” 18 Catholic control of education, he
charges, not only retards the technical advance of a nation by slighting
science, but it enables the clergy to form the mind of the child to
priestly domination . 19</p>
<p>The desire of the clergy in all times has been to be powerful and</p>
<p>opulent. By what method can it satisfy this desire? By selling
hope</p>
<p>and fear. The priests, wholesale dealers in these commodities, were
sensible that this sale would be assured and lucrative . 20 . . .
The</p>
<p>power of the priest depends upon the superstitions and stupid
credulity of the people. It is of little worth to him that they be
learned; the</p>
<p>less they know, the more docile they will be to his dictates . 31 . .
.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>685</p>
<p>In every religion the first objective of the priests is to stifle the
curi-</p>
<p>osity of men, to prevent the examination of every dogma whose absurd-
ity is too palpable to be concealed . 22 . . . Alan is born ignorant,
but he is not born a fool; and it is not without labor that he is made
one. That he should be made such, and be able to extinguish in himself
his natural light, much art and method must be employed; instruction
must heap upon him error upon error . 23 . . . There is nothing which
the sacer- dotal power cannot execute by the aid of superstition. For by
that it robs the magistrates of their authority and kings of their
legitimate power; thereby it subdues the people, and acquires a power
over them which is frequently superior to the laws; and thereby it
finally corrupts the very principles of morality . 21</p>
<p>Helvetius adds eight chapters on toleration.</p>
<p>Religious intolerance is the daughter of sacerdotal ambition and</p>
<p>stupid credulity . 23 … If I believe mv nurse and my tutor, every</p>
<p>other religion is false, mine alone is the truth. But is it
acknowledged as such by the universe? No: the earth still groans under
the multitude of temples consecrated to error . 26 . . . What does the
history of</p>
<p>religions teach us? That they have everywhere lighted up the torch of
intolerance, strewed the plains with corpses, imbrued the fields with
blood, burned cities, and laid waste empires . 27 . . . Are not the
Turks, whose religion is a religion of blood, more tolerant than we? We
see Christian churches at Constantinople, but there are no mosques
in</p>
<p>Paris . 28 . . . Toleration subjects the priest to the prince;
intolerance subjects the prince to the priest . 29</p>
<p>Helvetius is inclined to make one exception in favor of
intolerance:</p>
<p>There is one cause in which toleration can be detrimental to a
peo-</p>
<p>ple, and that is when it tolerates a religion that is intolerant,
such as the Catholic. This religion, becoming the most powerful in a
state, will al- ways shed the blood of its stupid protectors. . . . Let
not the insinuat- ing manner of the Catholics impose upon the
Protestants. The same priests who in Prussia regard intolerance as an
abomination and an</p>
<p>infraction of natural and divine law look on tolerance in France as
a</p>
<p>crime and a heresy. What renders the same man so different in differ-
ent countries? His weakness in Prussia and his power in France. When we
consider the conduct of Catholic Christians they at first, when</p>
<p>feeble, appear to be lambs; but when strong they are tigers . 30</p>
<p>Helvetius had a good word to say, now and then, for Christianity,
espe- cially for Protestantism. He was not an atheist, but he abhorred
the Biblical conception of God as “resembling an Oriental tyrant, . . .
punishing</p>
<p>686</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>slight faults with eternal torments .” 31 He hoped for a “universal
religion” which, under state control, would promote a “natural morality”
free from rewards and punishments after death . 32 He put human reason
above all human claims to a divine revela tion. “An honest man will
always obey his reason in preference to revelation; for it is, he will
say, more certain that God is the author of human reason . . . than that
he is the author of a particular book .” 33</p>
<p>But are not supernatural beliefs, and a divine sanction, necessary to
the efficacy of a moral code? Not at all, says Helvetius.</p>
<p>It is not on religion . . . but on legislation alone that the vices,
the</p>
<p>virtues, the power, and the felicity of the people depend. . . .
Every</p>
<p>crime not punished by the laws is daily committed; what stronger</p>
<p>proof can there be of the inutility of religion? . . . Whence
arises</p>
<p>the present security of Paris? From the devotion of its
inhabitants?</p>
<p>No, . . . from the regularity and vigil of the police. … At what</p>
<p>period did Constantinople become the sink of all the vices? At the
very time the Christian religion was established. . . . The most
Christian</p>
<p>kings have not been the greatest monarchs. Few of them have dis-</p>
<p>played the virtues of Titus, Trajan, or Antoninus. What pious
prince</p>
<p>can be compared with these ? 34</p>
<p>Hence it seemed to Helvetius that the task of philosophy was to
devise and promote a morality independent of religious belief. From this
point of view he wrote what one student has called “the most scientific
examination of social ethics to appear from the pen of any philosopher
He was re- solved neither to berate nor to idealize human nature; he
would take it as he found it, with all its selfishness, and try to build
upon it a natural ethic. By nature man is neither good nor bad; he is a
creature trying to preserve himself in a world where every organism will
sooner or later be eaten by another . 36 The picture that Rousseau had
recently given of primitive society seemed to Helvetius a jejune
imagination; Hobbes was nearer the truth in describing the “state of
nature” as a war of each against all . 37 The terms good and bad, as
applied to men, have sense only in society; all goodness is social
virtue, and is a product of social training for social ends.</p>
<p>Unhappy is the prince who confides in the original goodness of</p>
<p>character. M. Rousseau supposes its existence, experience denies it;
whoever consults this will learn that the child kills flies, beats his
dog, strangles his sparrow — that the child . . . has all the vices of
the man.</p>
<p>The man in power 〔freed from social restraints〕 is often unjust;
the</p>
<p>sturdy child is the same; when he is not checked by the presence of
his mates he appropriates by force, like the man in power, the sweet-
meat or plaything of his companion . 38</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>687</p>
<p>Obviously, then, there is no innate moral sense; all judgments of
right and wrong are developed during the experience of the individual
from the teachings and compulsions of his family, his community, his
government, and his church. When the individual is freed from these
compulsions — as in absolute rule, war, or a crowd — he tends to revert
to lawlessness and im- morality; and in “most nations morality is now
nothing more than a collec - tion of the . . . precepts dictated by the
powerful to secure their authority and to be unjust with impunity.” But
morality properly understood is “the science of the means invented by
men to live together in the happiest manner. … If those in power do not
oppose its progress, this science will advance in proportion as the
people acquire new knowledge.” 39</p>
<p>Helvetius is a frank hedonist: the goal of life is happiness here on
earth, happiness is a continuity of pleasure, and all pleasure is
basically sensual or physiological. 40 “The activity of the mind and the
acquisition of knowl - edge” are the most permanently satisfying
pleasures, 41 but they too are</p>
<p>To be virtuous it is necessary to unite nobleness of soul with an
en-</p>
<p>lightened understanding. Whoever combines these gifts conducts him-
self by the compass of public utility. This utility is the principle of
all human virtues, and the foundation of all legislation . . . All
laws</p>
<p>should follow a single principle, the utility of the public — i.e.,
of the greatest number of the persons under the same government . . .
This principle contains all morality and legislation. 42</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Helvetius’ view all actions, however moral and
virtuous, are egoistic. They are not necessarily selfish; many actions
are altruistic in the sense that they are intended to benefit others,
sometimes at great cost to the agent; but even these actions are
egoistic in the sense that they are motivated by the impulse to
self-satisfaction; we are altruistic because, by instinct or training,
we can take great pleasure in pleasing others; so the mother may
sacrifice herself for her child, as the hero for his country. When we do
good to others it is because we consciously or unconsciously remember
with pleasure the returned love, or the social approval, that followed
similar actions in the past; in this way certain altruistic deeds may
become habitual, and we may feel discomfort or fear if we do not perform
them. Religious asceticism or devotion may appear to be highly virtuous,
but it is only a long- term investment in celestial securities. “If a
hermit or a monk imposes upon himself the law of silence, flogs himself

<p>lives on pulse and water, sleeps on straw, … he thinks by virtue of
emacia- tion to gain a fortune in heaven .” 43 If a cruel action is not
condemned by the local community, these holy men will commit it without
shame or re- course, as in burning heretics . 44 Even friendship is
egoistic: it is an exchange of services, if only of ears; where such
exchange ceases, friendship fades; “nothing is more uncommon than a
friendship of long standing .” 45 “Ulti - mately it is always ourselves
that we love in others .” 40</p>
<p>Whereas La Rochefoucauld, in similarly reducing all motives to
self-</p>
<p>love, deplored it as a vice, Helvetius accepts it as a virtue insofar
as it makes for self- preservation. In any case it is a universal fact
of life; and “to be offended by the operations of self-love is to
complain of the showers of spring, the heats of summer, . . . the frosts
of winter .” 47 It is precisely upon the universality of self- love that
he proposes to establish a “scientific” morality. Education and
legislation can mold character and habit into finding discomfort in
unsocial actions, and pleasure in virtue — i.e., in action beneficial to
the group. The philosopher should study human behavior and social needs
with a view to discovering what forms of conduct are most beneficial to
the largest number of people, and he should plead with edu- cators and
legislators to provide inducements and deterrents that, by appeal- ing
to self-love, will encourage social behavior. What benefits would accrue
to mankind from such an entente between philosophers and kings! “The
virtues and happiness of a people come not from the sanctity of their
re- ligion, but from the wisdom of their laws .” 48</p>
<p>So, as the summit of his philosophy, Helvetius turned to study
legislation and government. Politically he is the most radical of the
philosophes. He does not share Voltaire’s faith in “enlightened
despots”; such rulers would tend to suppress any opinions but their own,
which might be mistaken and injurious. He quotes Frederick the Great as
saying to the Berlin Academy, “Nothing is better than an arbitrary
government under princes just,</p>
<p>humane, and virtuous; but nothing is worse under the common race of
kings .” 49 A limited or constitutional monarchy like England’s is good;
better is a federation of democratic republics pledged to united action
against an aggressor . 50 Theoretically aristocracy is unjust, since
superior ability is a product of chance; but complete democracy is
undesirable as long as the poor are uneducated and propertyless;
consequently a wise legislator will aim to spread education and
property.</p>
<p>This millionaire financier deplores the concentration of wealth and
its facilitation by a money economy.</p>
<p>The almost universal unhappiness of men and nations arises from the
imperfections of their laws, and the too unequal partition of their</p>
<p>riches. There are in most kingdoms only two classes of citizens,
one</p>
<p>of which wants necessaries while the other riots in superfluities .

<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>689</p>
<p>If the corruption of the people in power is never more manifest than
in the ages of the greatest luxury, it is because in those ages the
riches of a nation are collected into the smallest number of hands.
52</p>
<p>The replacement of land with money as the symbol and fulcrum of</p>
<p>power engenders such a race for riches as disturbs all social
stability, sharpens the class war, and leads to a ruinous inflation.</p>
<p>In a nation gradually increasing in wealth and money — especially</p>
<p>paper money — the cost of commodities and labor will continually</p>
<p>rise. … As labor becomes very dear in a rich nation, that nation
will</p>
<p>import more from other nations than it will export to them. If all
other factors remain the same, . . . the money of the rich nation will
in-</p>
<p>sensibly pass to the poorer nation, which, becoming opulent in turn,
will ruin itself in the same way. 53</p>
<p>Is there any escape from the concentration of wealth and the scramble
for money?</p>
<p>One would be to multiply the number of proprietors by making a</p>
<p>new distribution of the land. . . . When a man’s lands exceed a
certain number of acres, they should be taxed at a rate exceeding the
rent.</p>
<p>. . . Such a redistribution is made almost impossible in a money</p>
<p>economy, . . . 〔but〕 if wisely conceived it could be executed
by</p>
<p>continual and insensible alterations. 54</p>
<p>Diminish the riches of some, augment those of others, and put the
poor in such a state of ease that they may by seven or eight hours per
day abun- dantly provide for the wants of themselves and their families.
Then a people will become as happy as the nature of man will allow.

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Influence</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, in two books and one man, are almost all the ideas that made
the French Revolution, and almost all the ideas that agitate nations
today. No wonder educated Frenchmen, in the third quarter of the
eighteenth century, ranked Helvetius as almost the equal of Voltaire,
Rousseau, and Diderot, and gave his first book such popularity and
acclaim as was hardly accorded to any other volume of the age. “No
book,” said Brunetiere, “has made more noise in its time, or spread
abroad more ideas destined to make their way in the world.” 56 Brissot
reported in 1775 that “the system of Helvetius has the greatest vogue”;
Turgot, while opposing it, complained that it was praised “with a kind
of fury”; another described it as “found on</p>
<p>690</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>every toilette table.” 57 All critics commended the clarity of its
style, the force of its epigrams, and the evident humanitarianism of a
man who, hav- ing everything, advocated a redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>However, the philosophes them selves criticized his “system” as based
on erroneous conceptions. Voltaire defended the claims of heredity; all
men are not at birth equal in potential excellence of mind and
character; geniuses, he thought, are born, not made. 58 Diderot agreed
with Voltaire. In a Refutation de Fouvrage d.’’ Helvetius intitule U
Homme (written in 1775, but not published till a hundred years later) he
argued that sensations are transformed differently in different
individuals by inherited differences in the structure of the brain.
59</p>
<p>Man is not born blank. True, he is born without ideas and without</p>
<p>directed passions; but from the first moment of his life he is
endowed with a predisposition to conceive, compare, and retain some
ideas with more relish than others; and with dominant tendencies later
resulting in actual passions. 60</p>
<p>Here Diderot, who had begun with Locke, turned back to Leibniz and
held out a hand to Kant. The influence of environment and schooling, in
Diderot’s view, is always limited by heredity. “We cannot give what</p>
<p>nature has refused; perhaps we destroy what she gives. . . .
Education im- proves her gifts.” 61 He resented the reduction of
intellectual delights to sensual pleasure, and joined in the general
outcry against Helvet ius’ notion that all altruism is egoism
unconscious or concealed.</p>
<p>Mme. du Deffand was one of the few who agreed on this point with
Helvetius. “This man,” she said, “has revealed everybody’s secret 〔Cest
un homme qui a dit le secret de tout le monde 〕.” 62 Adam Smith,
following his friend Hume, insisted that altruism was founded upon
feelings of sym- pathy as innate as egoism; but in The Wealth of Nations
he based his economic theory on the universality of self-love. Mme.
Roland, in the ecstasies of the Revolution, was repelled by Helvetius.
“I felt myself im - pelled by a generosity which he never recognized. …
I confronted his theories with the great . . . heroes that history has
immortalized.” 63</p>
<p>These problems cannot be solved in a paragraph. It seems clear that
differences in hereditary or congenital constitution substantially
affect the operation of environment and education; how else shall we
explain the quite diverse character and development of brothers despite
the similarity of origin and opportunities? And yet Helvetius was on the
right track: within the limits decreed by heredity, immense changes can
be effected in the behavior of individuals and groups by differences in
environment, education, and legislation; how else shall we explain the
emergence of man</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>from barbarism to civilization? — Perhaps we should admit to
Helvetius that no one consciously acts in a way more painful than its
alternative. But certain social instincts — maternal love,
gregariousness, love of approval — though they cannot rival the
individualistic instincts in total force, are strong enough to generate
altruistic actions before any conscious weighing of pleasure, pain, or
result. Each of us is an ego, but some of us spread our egos to include
our family, community, country, or mankind. In this sense the largest
egos are the best.</p>
<p>In any case many men were moved to thought and action by Helvetius’
ideas. It was probably under his influence that La Chalotais began his
cam- paign to replace the schools of village priests, and the Jesuit
colleges, with a system of education controlled by the state. The public
schools of Amer- ica go back to the proposals of Condorcet, who called
himself a disciple of Helvetius. 64 Beccaria testified that the works of
Helvetius inspired him to write his historic plea for the reform of
penal law and policy. Bentham declared: “I owe to Helvetius’ De PEsprit
a great part of my ideas”— in- cluding the utilitarian principle of
seeking in morality and in legislation the greatest happiness of the
greatest number. 65 The National Convention of 1792 certified its sense
of Helvetius’ influence on the Revolution by giving his daughters the
title piles de la nation. William Godwin based his Enquiry concerning
Political Justice (1793) upon the teachings of Helvetius; and Godwin’s
wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, was led to compose her epochal Rights of
Woman (1792) partly by Hel vetius’ claim that the intellectual
inequalities between the sexes were largely due to inequalities of
education and opportunity. 66</p>
<p>Many of Helvetius’ contemporaries contrasted his theory of universal
egoism with the kindness of his character and the benevolence of his
life. Marmontel wrote of him: “There could not be a better man; liberal
and generous without ostentation, and beneficent from the goodness of
his heart.” 67 Grimm, seldom lavish in praise, described Helvetius as a
“true gentleman,” just, indulgent, free from all ill-humor, a good
husband, a good father, a good friend, a good man. 68 True of himself
were the words that Helvetius wrote in De l’ Esprit:</p>
<p>In order to love mankind we must expect little from them. . . .</p>
<p>Every man, so long as his passions do not obscure his reason, will
al- ways be more indulgent in proportion as he is more enlightened. . .
.</p>
<p>If the great man is always the most indulgent, … if he pours over</p>
<p>the faults of others the lenient balm of pity, and is slow in
discovering those faults, it is because the elevation of his mind will
not permit him to expatiate upon the vices and follies of individual
persons, but only upon those of mankind in general . 69</p>
<p>692</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>At Vore and in Paris he lived with his wife and children an idyl of
devo- tion and happiness. In 1764 he traveled in England and Germany,
met Hume and Gibbon and Frederick the Great. In 1770 he shared in
financing Pigalle’s statue of Voltaire. He died in 1771, with d’Holbach
and other friends at his bedside. His widow, loving his memory, refused
all suitors for her hand, including Benjamin Franklin. She survived her
husband by twenty-nine years, passed through the Revolution safely, and
died in 1 800, aged eighty-one.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>AUXILIARIES</li>
</ol>
<p>A very swarm of minor philosophes, in the third quarter of the eight-
eenth century, joined in the attack upon Christianity. They labored with
all the industry and enthusiasm of early Christians spreading the new
Gospel, or of Spanish Christians expelling Moors. They poured forth a
stream of tracts and treatises, and when their own profusion ebbed they
translated all the antireligious literature they could find, from
Lucretius to Hobbes. They devised a new calendar of saints and martyrs,
canonizing Julian the Apostate and idolizing Pomponazzi, Bruno,
Campanella, Vanini, Bayle, and other victims of persecution. They
condemned the Jews not for charging interest on loans but for having
begotten Christianity. They de- throned Jehovah as a monster of cruelty,
a god of war, the first of the genocides. They laughed at original sin,
and the God who had to send himself down to earth as his son, to be
scourged and crucified to appease the anger of himself as Father piqued
by a woman’s desire for apples or knowledge. They branded the Crusades
as a land-grabbing, commerce- cornering expedition. They scorned the
Middle Ages as all Dark Ages, and looked down upon the Gothic cathedrals
as barbarous and grotesque. D’Alembert noted about him “a certain
exaltation of ideas,” a “fermenta - tion,” a “general effervescence of
minds, . . . 〔which〕 with a kind of</p>
<p>violence has swept along with it everything that stood in its way.”
70</p>
<p>There was Jacques Andre Naigeon, whom Sainte- Beuve described as “a
fanatical beadle of atheism”; 71 he came to live and work with d’Holbach
as translator and editor; together they published in ten years thirty
books, large o r small, original or imported, all against Christianity;
“it is raining bombs in the house of the Lord,” said Diderot. 72 There
was Nicolas Bou - langer, another friend of d’Holbach, who labored in
the cause till his death (1759), and left behind him a manuscript
entitled Antiquite devoilee ( An- tiquity Unveiled). D’Holbach kept this
in storage till 1765, when the chief minister was Choiseul, friendly to
the philosophes; then he sent? it to the press with a flaming
introduction by Diderot. Religion, said Boulanger,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 693</p>
<p>arose through primitive man’s fears of floods and other apparently
super - natural catastrophes; it was organized by priests and kings in a
conspiracy to sanctify tyranny in return for tyrannical enforcement of
orthodox be- lief; and mankind would never escape from that dark
conspiracy except by following the light of reason in defiance of
priests and kings. 73</p>
<p>More important was Andre Morellet, another Jesuit product, one more
abbe wandering in rebel ranks. Born in 1727, he lived long enough to be
described by Mme. Necker as “a bear” who nevertheless “had candor,
probity, and a thousand good qualities, and enough religion to suspect
that there may be a God, and sometimes to admit it to his friends,
relying on their discretion not to reveal his credulity.” 74 Under
Diderot’s tutelage he wrote some articles for the Encyclopedic. At
d’Holbach’s dinners he dis - played so mordant a wit that Voltaire
called him the Abbe Mord-les — “the Reverend Mr. Bite- Them”; but
Marmontel wrote that he had “profound ideas . . . and a heart as upright
as it is sound.” 73 In 1762 he pubilshed a Manuel des Inquisiteurs,
composed of selections from the Directorium In- quisitorum of Nicolas
Eymerico, who had zealously served as Grand In- quisitor from 1356 to
1399. Frenchmen had almost forgotten the Spanish Inquisition; Morellet
refreshed their memory by merely quoting the pro- cedures and penalties
of that institution in its heyday. Malesherbes gave Morellet
governmental permission to print the book, for, he said, the penal code
of France was still practically identical with that of the Inquisitors.
76 Morellet could hardly believe it, but in the year that saw his book
go to press Jean Calas was broken on the wheel by the Parlement of
Toulouse.</p>
<p>Of another abbe, Guillaume Raynal, the usually calm Grimm reported in
his Correspondance for 1772: “Since Montesquieu’s Esprit des lois our
literature perhaps has produced no monument that is worthier to pass to
the remotest posterity, and to consecrate the progress of our
enlightenment, than Raynal’s Philosophical and Political History of
European Settlements</p>
<p>694</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Raynal had entered Paris as a poor priest. A legend that reveals the
gay mood of the rebels ascribed his escape from starvation to the fact
that the Abbe Prevost had received twenty sous to say a Mass for a dead
soul; that Prevost had paid the Abbe de Laporte fifteen sous to say it
in his stead; and that Laporte had paid Raynal eight sous to say it in
his stead. 79 Raynal was glad to eat at the tables of Helvetius and
d’Holbach; he proved to be pleasant company, and seems to have secured
the aid of several authors besides Diderot in collecting material, even
in writing sections of his book. Rousseau, who~quarreled with all and
sundry, found Raynal unquarrelable, and thanked him, in the Concessions,
for unswerving friendship and finan- cial aid. 80</p>
<p>Raynal must have made money somehow, for he is said to have bribed
the censor for permission to issue his book. 81 Twenty years of labor
had gone into its preparation. It detailed and denounced the greed,
treachery, and violence of the Europeans in dealing with the natives of
the East and West Indies, and it warned the white man of the terrible
revenge that the colored races might take if ever they came to power. 82
It was the first French indictment of colonial exploitation; it was
among the first books to stress the importance of commerce in
determining modern history; it contributed, in passing, to the
idealization of Indian natives, and to the cult of Chinese civilization
by European liberals. Running through the diffuse volumes were the
dominant themes of the Enlightenment: hatred of super- stition and
priestcraft, and resentment of state-and-Church tyranny over life and
thought. Raynal passionately subscribed to the view that Cathol- icism
was an imposture by which prelates and rulers had joined forces to
support each other through myths, miracles, propaganda, oppression, and
massacre. He appealed to the rulers of Europe to dissociate themselves
from all ecclesiastical ties, to allow freedom of speech and
publication, and to prepare the way for democratic government. He did
not spare Protes- tantism; this too, he said, had been guilty of
intolerance; and he described the fanaticism of the Puritans in New
England, the “witch” persecution in Salem.</p>
<p>Despite its long preparation, Raynal’s boo k was ultimately condemned
to oblivion by its faults. Careless in its facts, it mistook legends for
history, neglected dates, gave no references to authorities, confused
its materials, and engaged (or allowed Diderot to engage) in oratorical
effusions and emotional appeals hardly becoming in a work of history.
But those were no times for calm impartiality; a book was a weapon, and
could not be dulled by presenting opposed sides; literature was war. The
French gov- ernment so assumed; the Parlement of Paris ordered the book
to be burned, and Raynal was ordered to leave France. He fled to the
Netherlands, but thought it safe to return in 1784 under the mildest of
Bourbon kings.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 695</p>
<p>He was one of the few philosophes to see and survive the Revolution.
He was shocked by its violence and its use of all the old machinery of
in- tolerance. On May 31, 1791, aged seventy-eight, he addressed to the
Con- stituent Assembly a letter warning i t against excesses. “I have
long dared to tell kings of their duties,” he wrote; “let me today tell
the people of its errors.” He pointed out that the tyranny of the
populace could be as cruel and unjust as the despotism of monarchs. He
defended the right of the clergy to preach religion, so long as the
opponents of priestcraft were left free to speak their minds; he
protested against the laws enforcing a state religion, and against the
outrages of the mob upon priests. Robespierre persuaded the Assembly to
let the old man escape the guillotine, but Ray- nal’s property was
confiscated by the government, and he died in destitu - tion (1796) amid
the triumphs and terrors of the Revolution.</p>
<p>hi. d’holbach</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Amiable Atheist</li>
</ol>
<p>The best-beloved of all the philosophes in Paris was a German, born
(1723) at Edesheim in the episcopal principality of Speyer. He was bap-
tized as Paul Heinrich Dietrich von Holbach, and was reared as a Roman
Catholic. His grandfather had made a fortune by introducing ipecac from
Holland to Versailles. At Leiden Paul studied science and learned
English. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) he settled in Paris,
became a French subject, married into a family of financiers, and
achieved nobility by investing 1 10,000 livres at five per cent in the
“Company of Secretaries</p>
<p>His home became, as one wit put it, “the Cafe d’Europe”; his dinners
and salon in Paris or at his country villa, Grandval, made him, in
Horace Wal- pole’s phrase, the “maitre d’hotel of philosophy.” On
Thursdays and Sun - days Mme. d ’Holbach prepared the table for twelve
guests, not always the same, but most frequently the leaders of the
anti-Christian war: Diderot, Helvetius, d’Alembert, Raynal, Boulanger,
Morellet, Saint -Lambert, Mar- montel; sometimes Buffon, Turgot, and
Quesnay. Rousseau came, too, but shuddered at the atheism bubbling
around him. There Diderot was at his</p>
<p>696 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>wildest, and the Abbe Galiani kept philosophy on the ground by
punctur- ing theory with wit. The “Synagogue,” as the Baron called these
gatherings, met at two o’clock, talked, ate, and talked till seven or
eight; those were the days when conversation was unwritten literature,
not a chaos of in- terruptions and trivialities. No topics were barred
there; “that was the - tive conversation that ever was … in regard to
philosophy, religion, and government; light pleasantries had no place
there. … It was there, above all, that Diderot lighted our minds and
warmed our souls .” 84 Diderot him - self reported to Mile. Volland that
they talked “of art, poetry, the phi - losophy of love, . . . the
sentiment of immortality, of men, gods, and kings, of space and time, of
dea th and life .” 85 “Sometimes,” said Marmontel, “I thought I heard
the disciples of Pythagoras or Plato .” 86 Or,</p>
<p>when the fine weather came, we sometimes exchanged these dinners for
philosophical walks . . . along the banks of the Seine; the repast</p>
<p>on those days was a large dinner of fish; and we went by turns to the
places most celebrated for the supply of that article, commonly to St.-
Cloud. We went down early in a boat, breathing the air of the river,</p>
<p>and we returned in the evening through the Bois de Boulogne . 87</p>
<p>D’Holbach’s salon became so famous that foreigners visiting Paris
pulled wires to get an invitation. So, at divers times, came Hume,
Sterne, Garrick, Horace Walpole, Franklin, Priestley, Adam Smith,
Beccaria. They were somewhat disturbed by the number of atheists they
found there; how many times have we heard the story (told by Diderot to
Romilly) that when Hume doubted the actual existence of atheists, the
Baron assured him, “Here you are at table with seventeen .” 88 Gibbon re
lated that the phi- losophes of Paris “laughed at the cautious
skepticism of Hume, preached</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI ) THE SPREADING CAMPAIGN 697</p>
<p>It would give you great satisfaction to find that there is not a
single deist among them.” 92 The evidence is rather confusing.</p>
<p>But all agreed that the Baron and his wife were perfect hosts and
lovable characters. Mme. d’Holbach, according to Grimm, lived only for
her hus - band; once she had welcomed and nourished his guests, she
retired to a corner with her knitting and took no further part in the
conversation. 03 She died in 1754, in the prime of her life; for a time
d’Holbach remained “in a state of utter despair.” 94 Two years later he
married her sister, who proved equally devoted. He was so unassuming in
his manners, so amiable in argu- ment, so secret in his beneficence, 95
that hardly anyone suspected him of writing so powerful a defense of
atheism as the Systeme de la nature. “I never saw a man more simply
simple,” said his salonniere rival, Mme. Geoff rin. 06 Rousseau, who
learned to hate nearly all the philosophes, retained such admiration for
d’Holbach’s character that he used him as a model for the virtuous
agnostic Wolmar in La Nouvelle Helo’ise. Grimm, who analyzed everyone
but Rousseau with calm objectivity, wrote:</p>
<p>It was natural for Baron d’Holbach to believe in the empire of rea
-</p>
<p>son, for his passions (and we always judge others by ourselves) were
such as in all cases to give the ascendancy to virtue and correct</p>
<p>principles. It was impossible for him to hate anyone; yet he
could</p>
<p>not, without an effort, dissemble his professed horror of priests. .
. . Whenever he spoke of these his naturally good temper forsook him.
07</p>
<p>So d’Holbach warmly supported the Encyclopedic, contributed money and
articles to it, and gave Diderot comfort and courage when even
d’Alembert and Voltaire were deserting the enterprise. His articles
were</p>
<p>Fascinated by science, and expecting from it a rapid betterment
of</p>
<p>human life, d’Holbach looked with unrelenting hostility upon the
Church, whose control of education seemed to bar the way to the
development of scientific knowledge. He lost no chance of attacking the
clergy. He wrote the articles “Pretres” and “Theocratie” for the
Encyclopedic . From 1766 onward he organized with Naigeon a veritable
factory of anti-Christian literature. In quick succession appeared Le
Tableau des saints, De P Im- posture sacerdotale, Pretres demasques, De
la Cruaute religieuse, UEnfer detruit; here was a new apostle of glad
tidings — hell had been destroyed.</p>
<p>698</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>In 1761 there issued from what some called “this laboratory of
atheism” a volume entitled Christianisme devoile ( Christianity Exposed
), written chiefly by d’Holbach but ascribed on the title page to “the
late M. Bou - langer.” For selling this book a peddler was branded and
sent to the galleys for five years; for buying and reselling it a boy
was branded and sent to the galleys for nine years.“ It was a frontal
assault upon the alliance of Church and state, and qu ite anticipated
Marx’s description of religion as the “opium of the people.”</p>
<p>Religion is the art of intoxicating men with enthusiasm 〔this
word</p>
<p>in the eighteenth century meant religious fervor〕, to prevent
them</p>
<p>from dealing with the evils with which their governors oppress them.
. . . The art of reigning has become nothing more than that of profit-
ing from the errors and abjection of mind and soul into which super-
stition has plunged the nations. … By means of threatening men</p>
<p>with invisible powers, they 〔Church and state〕 force them to
suffer</p>
<p>in silence the miseries with which visible powers afflict them.
They</p>
<p>are made to hope that if they agree to being unhappy in this
world,</p>
<p>they will be happy in the next. 100</p>
<p>D’Holbach thought this union of Church and state the fundamental evil
in France. “It is as a citizen that I attack religion, because it seems
to me harm - ful to the happiness of the state, hostile to the mind of
man, and contrary to sound morality.” 101</p>
<p>Instead of morality the Christian is taught the miraculous fables</p>
<p>and inconceivable dogmas of a religion thoroughly hostile to
right</p>
<p>reason. From his very first step in his studies he is taught to
distrust the evidence of his senses, to subdue his reason, . . . and to
rely</p>
<p>blindly on the authority of his master. . . . Those who have
shaken</p>
<p>themselves free from these notions find themselves powerless against
errors sucked in with their mother’s milk. 102</p>
<p>To rest morality upon religious beliefs, d’Holbach ar gued, is a
risky pro- cedure, for such beliefs are subject to change, and their
fall may damage the moral code allied with them.</p>
<p>Everyone who has discovered the weakness or falsity of the evidence
upon which his religion is based . . . will be tempted to believe
that</p>
<p>the morality is as chimerical as the religion it is founded on. . . .
That is how it is that the words infidel and libertine have become
synon</p>
