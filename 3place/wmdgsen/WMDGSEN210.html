<h4 id="chapter-xxvi">CHAPTER XXVI</h4>
<p>Jesus</p>
<p>4 B.C.-A.D. 30</p>
<p>I. THE SOURCES</p>
<p>D ID Christ exist? Is the life story of the founder of Christianity
the</p>
<p>product of human sorrow, imagination, and hope — a myth comparable to
the legends of Krishna, Osiris, Attis, Adonis, Dionysus, and Mithras?
Early in the eighteenth century the circle of Bolingbroke, shocking even
Voltaire, privately discussed the possibility that Jesus had never
lived. Vol- ney propounded the same doubt in his Ruins of Empire in
1791. Napoleon, meeting the German scholar Wieland in 1808, asked him no
petty question of politics or war, but did he believe in the historicity
of Christ? 1</p>
<p>One of the most far-reaching activities of the modem mind has been
the “Higher Criticism” of the Bible— the mounting attack upon its
authenticity and veracity, countered by the heroic attempt to save the
historical foundations of Christian faith; the results may in time prove
as revolutionary as Christianity itself. The first engagement in this
two-hundred-year war was fought in silence by Hermann Reimarus,
professor of Oriental languages at Hamburg; on his death in 1768 he
left, cautiously unpublished, a 1400-page manuscript on the life of
Christ. Sue years later Gotthold Lessing, over the protests of his
friends, published portions of it as the Wolfenbiittel Fragments.
Reimarus argued that Jesus can only be regarded and understood not as
the founder of Christianity, but as the final and dominant figure in the
mystical eschatology of the Jews — i.e., Christ thought not of
establishing a new religion, but of preparing men for the imminent
destruction of the world, and God’s Last Judgment of all souls. In 1796
Herder pointed out the apparently irreconcilable difference between the
Christ of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and the Christ of the Gospel of
St. John. In 1828 Heinrich Paulus, summarizing the life of Christ in
1192 pages, proposed a rationalistic interpretation of the miracles —
i.e., accepted their occurrence but ascribed them to natural causes and
powers. In an epoch-marking Life of Jesus (1835-36) David Strauss
rejected this compromise; the supernatural elements in the Gospels, he
thought, should be classed as myths, and the actual career of Christ
must be reco nstructed without using these elements in any form.
Strauss’s massive volumes made Biblical criticism the storm center of
German thought for a generation. In the same year Ferdinand Christian
Baur attacked the Epistles</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>of Paul, rejecting as unauthentic all but those to the Galatians,
Corinthians, and Romans. In 1 840 Bruno Bauer began a series of
passionately controversial works aiming to show that Jesus was a myth,
the personified form of a cult that evolved in the second century from a
fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology. In 1863 Ernest Renan’s Life
of Jesus, alarming millions with its rationalism and charming millions
with its prose, gathered together the results of German criti- cism, and
brought the problem of the Gospels before the entire educated world. The
French school reached its climax at the end of the century in the Abbe
Loisy, who subjected the New Testament to such rigorous textual analysis
that the Catholic Church felt com pelled to excommunicate him and other
“Mod - ernists.” Meanwhile the Dutch school of Pierson, Naber, and
Matthas carried the movement to its farthest point by laboriously
denying the historical reality of Jesus. In Germany Arthur Drews gave
this negative conclusion its definitive exposition (1906); and in
England W. B. Smith and J. M. Robertson argued to a like denial. The
result of two centuries of discussion seemed to be the annihila- tion of
Christ.</p>
<p>What evidence is there for Christ’s existence? The earliest
non-Christian reference occurs in Josephus’ Antiquities of the Jews
(a.d. 93? ) :</p>
<p>At that time lived Jesus, a holy man, if man he may be called,
for</p>
<p>he performed wonderful works, and taught men, and joyfully re-</p>
<p>ceived the truth. And he was followed by many Jews and many</p>
<p>Greeks. He was the Messiah. 2</p>
<p>There may be a genuine core in these strange lines; but the high
praise given to Christ by a Jew uniformly anxious to please either the
Romans or the Jews — both at that time in conflict with Christianity —
renders the passage suspect, and Christian scholars reject it as almost
certainly an interpolation.® There are references to “Yeshu’a of
Nazareth” in the Talmud, but they are too late in date to be certainly
more than counterechoes of Christian thought. 4 The oldest known mention
of Christ in pagan literature is in a letter of the younger Pliny ( ca .
no), 5 asking the advice of Trajan on the treatment of Christians. Five
years later Tacitus 0 * described Nero’s perse - cution of the
Chrestiani in Rome, and pictured them as already (a.d. 64) numbering
adherents throughout the Empire; the paragraph is so Tacitean in style,
force, and prejudice that of all Biblical critics only Drews questions
its authenticity. 7 Suetonius (ca. 125) mentions the same persecution, 8
and reports Claudius’ banishment (ca. 52) of “Jews who, stirred up by
Christ 〔impulsore Chresto 〕, were causing public disturbances,” 0 the
passage accords well with the Acts of the Apostles, which mentions a
decree of Claudius that “the Jews should leave Rome.” 10 These
references prove the existence</p>
<p>•’* Quoted on p. 281.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) JESUS</p>
<p>of Christians rather than of Christ; but unless we assume the latter
we are driven to the improbable hypothesis that Jesus was invented in
one genera- tion; moreover, we must suppose that the Christian community
in Rome had been established some years before 52, to merit the
attention of an imperial decree. About the middle of this first century
a pagan named Thallus, in a fragment preserved by Julius Africanus, 11
argued that the abnormal darkness alleged to have accompanied the death
of Christ was a purely natural phenomenon and coincidence; the argument
took the existence of Christ for granted. The denial of that existence
seems never to have occurred even to the bitterest gentile or Jewish
opponents of nascent Christianity.</p>
<p>The Christian evidence for Christ begins with the letters ascribed
to</p>
<p>Saint Paul. Some of these are of uncertain authorship; several,
antedating a.d. 64, are almost universally accounted as substantially
genuine. No one has questioned the existence of Paul, or his repeated
meetings with Peter, James, and John; and Paul enviously admits that
these men had known Christ in the flesh. 12 The accepted epistles
frequently refer to the Last Sup- per 13 and the crucifixion. 14</p>
<p>Matters are not so simple as regards the Gospels. The four that have
come down to us are survivors from a much larger number that once
circulated among the Christians of the first two centuries. Our English
term gospel (Old English godspel, good news) is a rendering of the Greek
euangelion, which is the opening word of Mark, and means “glad tidings”—
that the Messiah had come, and the Kingdom of God was at hand. The
Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are “synoptic”: their contents and
episodes allow of being arranged in parallel columns and “viewed
together.” They were written in the Greek koine of popular speech, and
were no models of gram- mar or literary finish; nevertheless, the
directness and force of their simple style, the vivid power of their
analogies and scenes, the depth of their feeling, and the profound
fascination of the story they tell give even the rude originals a unique
charm, immensely enhanced for the English world by the highly inaccurate
but lordly version made for King James.</p>
<p>The oldest extant copies of the Gospels go back only to the third
century. The original compositions were apparently written between a.d.
60 and 120, and were therefore exposed to two centuries of errors in
transcription, and to possible alterations to suit the theology or aims
of the copyist’s sect or time.</p>
<p>323306 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP, XXVI</p>
<p>transc ribed in Hebrew the Logia ”— apparently an early Aramaic
collection of the sayings of Christ. Probably Paul had some such
document, for though he men- tions no gospels he occasionally quotes the
direct words of Jesus.* Criticism gen- erally agrees in giving the
Gospel of Mark priority, and in dating it between 65 and</p>
<ol start="70" type="1">
<li>Since it sometimes repeats the same matter in different forms, 10 it
is widely be- lieved to have been based upon the Logia , and upon
another early narrative which may have been the original composition of
Mark himself. Our Gospel of Mark was apparently circulated while some of
the apostles, or their immediate disciples, were still alive; it seems
unlikely, therefore, that it differed substantially from their
recollection and interpretation of Christ. 17 We may conclude, with the
brilliant but judicious Schweitzer, that the Gospel of Mark is in
essentials “genuine history.” 18</li>
</ol>
<p>Orthodox tradition placed Matthew’s Gospel first. Irenaeus 10
describes it as originally composed in “Hebrew”— i.e., Aramaic; but it
has come down to us only in Greek. Since in this form it apparently
copies Mark, and probably also the Logia , criticism inclines to ascribe
it to a disciple of Matthew rather than to the “publican” himself; even
the most skeptical students, however, concede to it as early a date as
a.d. 85-90. 20 Aiming to convert Jews, Matthew relies more than the
other evangelists on the miracles ascribed to Jesus, and is suspiciously
eager to prove that many Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled in
Christ. Never- theless, it is the most moving of the four Gospels, and
must be ranked among the unconscious masterpieces of the world’s
literature.</p>
<p>The Gospel according to St. Luke, generally assigned to the last
decade of the first century, announces its desire to co-ordinate and
reconcile earlier accounts of Jesus, and aims to convert not Jews but
gentiles. Very probably Luke was himself a gentile, the friend of Paul,
and the author of the Acts of the Apostles. 21 Like Matthew he borrows
much from Mark. 22 Of the 661 verses in the received text of Mark over
600 are reproduced in Matthew, and 3 50 in Luke, mostly word for word.
23 Many passages in Luke that are not in Mark occur in Matthew, again
nearly verbatim; apparently Luke borrowed these from Matthew, or Luke
and Matthew took them from a common source, now lost. Luke works up
these candid borrowings with some literary skill; Renan thought this
Gospel the most beautiful book ever written. 24</p>
<p>The Fourth Gospel does not pretend to be a biography of Jesus; it is
a pres- entation of Christ from the theological point of view, as the
divine Logos or Word, creator of the world and redeemer of mankind. It
contradicts the synoptic gospels in a hundred details and in its general
picture of Christ. 25 The half-Gnostic character of the work, and its
emphasis on metaphysical ideas, have led many Christian scholars to
doubt that its author was the apostle John. 26 Experience suggests,
however, that an old tradition must not be too quicldy rejected; our
ancestors were not all fools. Recent studies tend to restore the Fourth
Gospel</p>
<p>• In 1897 and 1903 Grenfell and Hunt discovered in the ruins of
Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt, twelve fragments of logia loosely corresponding
to passages in the Gospels. These papyri are not older than the third
century, but they may be copies of older manuscripts.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVI ) JESUS 557</p>
<p>to a date near the end of the first century. Probably tradition was
correct in assigning to the same author the “Epistles of John”; they
speak the same ideas in the same style.</p>
<p>In summary, it is clear that there are many contradictions between
one gospel and another, many dubious statements of history, many
suspicious resemblances to the legends told of pagan gods, many
incidents apparently designed to prove the fulfillment of Old Testament
prophecies, many pas- sages possibly aiming to establish a historical
basis for some later doctrine or ritual of the Church. The evangelists
shared with Cicero, Sallust, and Tacitus the conception of history as a
vehicle for moral ideas. And presum- ably the conversations and speeches
reported in the Gospels were subject to the frailties of illiterate
memories, and the errors or emendations of copyists.</p>
<p>All this granted, much remains. The contradictions are of minutiae,
not substance; in essentials the synoptic gospels agree remarkably well,
and form a consistent portrait of Christ. In the enthusiasm of its
discoveries the Higher Criticism has applied to the New Testament tests
of authenticity so severe that by them a hundred ancient worthies —
e.g., Hammurabi, David, Socrates — would fade into legend.* Despite the
prejudices and theological preconceptions of the evangelists, they
record many incidents that mere in- ventors would have concealed — the
competition of the apostles for high places in the Kingdom, their flight
after Jesus’ arrest, Peter’s denial, the failure of Christ to work
miracles in Galilee, the references of some auditors to his possible
insanity, his early uncertainty as to his mission, his confessions of
ignorance as to the future, his moments of bitterness, his despairing
cry on the cross; no one reading these scenes can doubt the reality of
the figure behind them. That a few simple men should in one generation
have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic
and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far
more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels. After two centuries of
Higher Criticism the outlines of the life, character, and teaching of
Christ, remain reasonably clear, and constitute the most fascinating
feature in the history of Western man.</p>

<li>THE GROWTH OF JESUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Matthew and Luke assign Jesus’ birth to “the days when Hero d
was Icing of Judea” 27 — consequently before 3 b.c. Luke, however,
describes</p>
<p>• Says a great Jewish scholar, perhaps too strongly: “If we had
ancient sources like those in the Gospels for the history of Alexander
or Caesar, we should not cast any doubt upon them whatsoever.”—

<p>558 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>Jesus as “about thirty years old” when John baptized him “in the
fifteenth year of Tiberius” 27a — i.e., a.d. 28- 29; this would place
Christ’s birth i n the year 2- 1 b.c. Luke adds that “in those days
there went out a decree of Caesar</p>
<p>governor of Syria.” Quirinius is knowp to have been legate in Syria
between</p>
<p>Matthew and Luke place the birth of Christ in Bethlehem, five miles
south of Jerusalem; thence, they tell us, the family moved to Nazareth
in Galilee. Mark makes no mention of Bethlehem, but merely names Christ
“Jesus of Nazareth.” * His parents gave him the quite common name
Yeshu’a (our Joshua), meaning “the help of Yahveh”; the Greeks made this
into lesous, the Romans into Iesus.</p>
<p>He was apparently one of a large family, for his neighbors, marveling
at his authoritative teaching, asked, “Where did he get this wisdom, and
the power to do these wonders? Is he not the carpenter’s son? Is not his
mother named Mary, and are not his brothers named James, Joseph, Simon,
and Judas? And do not his sisters live here among us?” 31 Luke tells the
story of the Annunciation with some literary art, and puts into the
mouth of Miriam — Mary — that Magnificat which is one of the great poems
embedded in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Next to her son, Mary is the most touching figure in the narrative.’

<p>from the exciting throng of his followers and bring him back to the
healing quiet of his home (“thy father and I have sought thee
sorrowing”), help - lessly witnessing his crucifixion, and receiving his
body into her arms; if this is not history it is supreme literature, for
the relations of parents and children hold deeper dramas than those of
sexual love. The tales later circu- lated, by Celsus and others, about
Mary and a Roman soldier are by critical consent “clumsy fabrications.”
32 Not so awkward are the stories, chiefly contained in the apocryphal
or uncanonical gospels, about the birth of Christ in a cave or stable,
the adoration of the shepherds and the Magi, the massacre of the
innocents, and the flight into Egypt; the mature mind will not resent
this popular poetry. The virgin birth is not mentioned by Paul or John;
and Matthew and Luke, who tell of it, trace Jesus back to David through
Joseph, by conflicting genealogies; apparently the belief in the virgin
birth rose later than that in the Davidic descent.</p>
<p>The evangelists tell us little of Christ’s youth. When he was eight
days old he was circumcized. Joseph was a carpenter, and the
occupational heredity usual in that age suggests that Jesus followed
that pleasant trade for a time. He knew the craftsmen of his village,
and the landlords, stewards, tenants, and slaves of his rural
surroundings; his speech is studded with them. He was sensitive to the
natural beauties of the countryside, to the grace and color of flowers,
and the silent fruitfulness of trees. The story of his questioning the
scholars in the temple is not incredible; he had an alert and curious
mind, and in the Near East a boy of twelve already touches maturity. But
he had no formal education. “How is it,” his neighbors asked, “that this
man can read when he has never gone to school?” 33 He attended the syna
- gogue, and heard the Scriptures with evident delight; the Prophets and
the Psalms above all sank deep into his memory, and helped to mold him.
Per- haps he read also the books of Daniel and Enoch, for his later
teaching was shot through with their visions of the Messiah, the Last
Judgment, and the coming Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The air he breathed was tense with religious excitement. Thousands of
Jews awaited anxiously the Redeemer of Israel. Magic and witchcraft,
demons and angels, “possession” and exorcism, miracles and prophecies,
divination and astrology were taken for granted everywhere; probably the
story of the Magi was a necessary concession to the astrological convic-
tions of the age . 34 Thaumaturgists — wonder-workers — toured the
towns. On the annual journeys that all good Palestinian Jews made to
Jerusalem for the Passover festival, Jesus must have learned something
of the Essenes, and their half-monastic, almost Buddhistic, life; *
possibly he heard also of a sect • Ashoka had sent his Buddhist
missionaries as far west as Egypt and Cyrene; 35 very likely, therefore,
to the Near East.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>called “Nazarenes,” who dwelt beyond the Jordan in Peraea, rejected
Tem - ple worship, and denied the binding character of the Law . 36 But
the experi- ence that aroused him to religious fervor was the preaching
of John, the son of Mary’s cousin Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Josephus tells John’s story in some detail . 87 We tend to picture
the Baptist as an old man; on the contrary, he was apparently of the
same age as Jesus. Mark and Matthew describe him as garbed in haircloth,
living on dried locusts and honey, standing beside the Jordan, and
calling people to repent- ance. He shared the asceticism of the Essenes,
but differed from them in holding one baptism to be enough; his name
“the Baptist” may be a Greek equiv alent of “Essene” (bather ). 38 To
his rite of symbolic purification John added a menacing condemnation of
hypocrisy and loose living, warned sinners to prepare themselves for the
Last Judgment, and proclaimed the early coming of the Kingdom of God .
39 If all Judea should repent and be cleansed of sin, said John, the
Messiah and the Kingdom would come at once.</p>
<p>In or shortly after “the fifteenth year of Tiberius,” says Luke,
Jesus came down to the Jordan to be baptized by John. This decision, by
a man now “about thirty years old ,” 40 attested Christ’s acceptance of
John’s teaching; his own would be essentially the same. His methods and
character, however, were different: he would himself never baptize
anyone , 41 and he would live not in the wilderness but in the world.
Soon after this meeting Herod Antipas, tetrarch (“ruler of four cities”)
of Galilee, ordered the imprison - ment of John. The Gospels ascribe the
arrest to John’s criticism of Herod’s acts in divorcing his wife and
marrying Herodias while she was still the wife of his half brother
Philip. Josephus attributes the arrest to Herod’s fear that</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE MISSION</li>
</ol>
<p>When John was imprisoned Jesus took up the Baptist’s work, and began
to preach the coming of the Kingdom . 45 He “returned to Galilee,” says
Luk e, “and taught in the synagogues.” 46 We have an impressive picture
of the young idealist talcing his turn at reading the Scriptures to the
congre- gation at Nazareth, and choosing a passage from Isaiah:</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) JESUS 561</p>
<p>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to</p>
<p>preach glad tidings to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-
hearted, to preach deliverance to captives, and recovery of sight to</p>
<p>the blind, to set the down-trodden free . 47</p>
<p>“The eyes of everyone in the synagogue,” Luke adds, “were fixed upon
him. And he began by saying to them, ‘This passage of Scripture has been

him, and were</p>
<p>It is difficult to see him objectively, not only because the evidence
is derived from those who worshiped him, but even more because our own
moral heritage and ideals are so closely bound up with him and formed on
his example that we feel injured in finding any flaw in his character.
His religious sensitivity was so keen that he condemned severely those
who would not share his vision; he could forgive any fault but unbelief.
There are in the Gospels some bitter passages quite out of key with what
else we are told about Christ. He seems to have taken over without
scrutiny the harshest contemporary notions of an everlasting hell where
unbelievers and unrepentant sinners would suffer from inextinguishable
fire and insatiable worms . 50 He tells without protest how the poor man
in heaven was not per- mitted to let a single drop of water fall upon
the tongue of the rich man in hell . 51 He counsels nobly, “Judge not,
that ye be not judged,” but he cursed the men and cities that would not
receive his gospel, and the fig tree that bore no fruit . 52 He may have
been a bit harsh to his mother . 53 He had the puritan zeal of the
Hebrew prophet rather than the broad calm of the Greek sage. His
convictions consumed him; righteous indignation now and then blurred his
profound humanity; his faults were the price he paid for that passionate
faith which enabled him to move the world.</p>
<p>For the rest he was the most lovable of men. We have no portrait of
him, nor do the evangelists describe him; but he must have had some
physical comeliness, as well as spiritual magnetism, to attract so many
women as well as men. We gather from stray words 54 that, like other men
of that age and land, he wore a tunic under a cloak, had sandals on his
feet, and probably a cloth headdress falling over his shoulders to
shield him from the sun . 55 Many women sensed in him a sympathetic
tenderness that aroused in them an un- stinted devotion. The fact that
only John tells the story of the woman taken</p>
<p>562 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>in adultery is no argument against its truth; it does not help John’s
theology, and is completely in character with Christ.* Of like beauty,
and hardly within the inventive powers of the evangelists, is the
account of the prostitute who, moved by his ready acceptance of
repentant sinners, knelt before him, anointed his feet with precious
myrrh, let her tears fall upon them, and dried them with her hair; of
her Jesus said that her sins were forgiven “because she loved much.” 07
We are told that mothers brought their children to be touched by him,
and “he took the children in his arms, laid his hands upon th em, and
blessed them.” 58</p>
<p>Unlike the prophets, the Essenes, and the Baptist, he was no ascetic.
He is represented as providing abundant wine for a marriage feast, as
living with “publicans and sinners,” and receiving a Magdalene into his
company. He was not hostile to the simple joys of life, though he was
unbiologically harsh on the desire of a man for a maid. Occasionally he
partook of banquets in the homes of rich men. Generally, however, he
moved among the poor, even among the almost untouchable Amhaarez so
scorned and shunned by Sad- ducees and Pharisees alike. Realizing that
the rich would never accept him, he built his hopes upon an overturn
that would make the poor and humble supreme in the coming Kingdom. He
resembled Caesar only in taking his stand with the lower classes, and in
the quality of mercy; otherwise what a world of outlook, character, and
interests separated them! Caesar hoped to reform men by changing
institutions and laws; Christ wished to remake institutions, and lessen
laws, by changing men. Caesar too was capable of anger, but his emotions
were always under the control of his clear-eyed intellect. Jesus was not
without intellect; he answered the tricky questions of the Pharisees
with almost a lawyer’s skill, and yet with wisdom; no one could confuse
him, even in the face of death. But his powers of mind were not
intellectual, did not depend upon knowledge; they were derived from
keenness of perception, intensity of feeling, and singleness of purpose.
He did not claim omniscience; he could be surprised by events; only his
earnest- ness and enthusiasm led him to overestimate his capacities, as
in Nazareth and Jerusalem. That his powers were nevertheless exceptional
seems proved by his miracles.</p>
<p>Probably these were in most cases the result of suggestion — the
influence of a strong and confident spirit upon impressionable souls.
His presence was itself a tonic; at his optimistic touch the weak grew
strong and the sick were made well. The fact that like stories have been
told of other characters in legend and history 50 does not prove that
the miracles of Christ were myths.</p>

of Mark and Luke; it</p>

<p>With a few exceptions they are not beyond belief; similar phenomena
may be observed almost any day at Lourdes, and doubtless occurred in
Jesus’ time at Epidaurus and other centers of psychic healing in the
ancient world; the apostles too would work such cures. The psychological
nature of the miracles is indicated by two features: Christ himself
attributed his cures to the “faith” of those whom he healed; and he
could not perform miracles in Nazareth, apparently because the people
there looked upon him as “the carpenter’s son,” and refused to believe
in his unusual powers; hence his remark that “a prophet is not without
honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.” 00 We are told of
Mary Magdalene that “seven demons had been driven out of her”; i.e., she
suffered from nervous diseases and seizures (the word recalls the theory
of “possession”) ; these seemed to abate</p>
<p>These men were hardly of the type that one would have chosen to re-
mold the world. The Gospels realistically differentiate their
characters, and honestly expose their faults. They were frankly
ambitious; to quiet them Jesus promised that at the Last Judgment they
would sit upon twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel . 62
When the Baptist was imprisoned one of his followers, Andrew, attached
himself to Jesus, and brought with him his brother Simon, whom Christ
called Cephas — “the rock”; the Greeks translated the name into Petros.
Peter is a thoroughly human figure, im- pulsive, earnest, generous,
jealous, at times timid to the point of a forgivable cowardice. He and
Andrew were fishermen on the Lake of Galilee; so were the two sons of
Zebedee — James and John; these four forsook their work and their
families to become an inner circle about Christ. Matthew was the
collector of customs at the frontier town of Capernaum; he was a “pub -
lican”— i.e., a man engaged in public or state business, therefore in
this case serving Rome, and hated by every Jew who longed for freedom.
Judas of Kerioth was the only one of the apostles who did not come from
Galilee.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>564</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>The Twelve pooled their material possessions, and entrusted Judas
with their common funds. As they followed Christ in his missionary
wandering they lived on the country, taking their food now and then from
the fields they passed, and accepting the hospitality of converts and
friends. In addi- tion to the Twelve Jesus appointed seventy-two others
as disciples, and sent two of them to each town that he intended to
visit. He bade them “carry no purse, nor wallet, nor shoes.” 83 Kindly
and pious women joined the apostles and disciples, contributed to their
support, and performed for them those solicitous domestic functions
which are the supreme consola- tion of male life. Through that little
band, lowly and letterless, Christ sent his gospel into the world.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE GOSPEL</li>
</ol>
<p>He taught with the simplicity required by his audiences, with
interesting stories that insinuated his lessons into the understanding,
with pungent aphor- isms rather than with reasoned argument, and with
similes and metaphors as brilliant as any in literature. The parable
form that he used was cus- tomary in the East, and some of his fetching
analogies had come down to him, perhaps unconsciously, from the
prophets, the psalmists, and the rabbis ; 84 nevertheless, the
directness of his speech, the vivid colors of his imagery, the warm
sincerity of his nature lifted his utterances to the most inspired
poetry. Some of his sayings are obscure, some seem at first sight unjust
, 85 some are sharp with sarcasm and bitterness; nearly all of them are
models of brevity, clarity, and force.</p>
<p>His starting point was the Gospel of John the Baptist, which itself
went back to Daniel and Enoch; historia non facit saltum. The Kingdom of
Heaven was at hand, he said; soon God would put an end to the reign of
wickedness on earth; the Son of Man would come “on the clouds of the
sky” to judge all humanity, living and dead . 88 The t ime for
repentance was running out; those who repented, lived justly, loved God,
and put their faith in his messenger would inherit the Kingdom, would be
raised to power and glory in a world at last freed from all evil,
suffering, and death.</p>
<p>As these ideas were familiar to his hearers, Christ did not define
them clearly, and many difficulties obscure his conception now. What did
he mean by the Kingdom? A supernatural heaven? Apparently not, for the
apostles and the early Christians unanimously expected an earthly king-
dom. This was the Jewish tradition that Christ inherited; and he taught
his followers to pray to the Father, “Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done
on</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) JESUS 565</p>
<p>earth as it is in heaven.” Only after that hope had faded did the
Gospel of John make Jesus say, “My kingdom is not of ’ this world.” 07
Did he mean a spiritual condition, or a material utopia? At times he
spoke of the King- dom as a state of soul reached by the pure and
sinless ° 8 — “the Kingdom of God is within you”; 09 at other times he
pictured it as a happy future so - ciety in which the apostles would be
rulers, and those who had given or suffered for Christ’s sake would
receive a hundredfold reward . 70 He seems to have thought of moral
perfection as only metaphorically the Kingdom, as the preparation and
price for the Kingdom, and as the condition of all saved souls in the
Kingdom when realized . 71</p>
<p>When would the Kingdom come? Soon. “I will drink no more of the</p>
<p>fruit of the vine until I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.” 72 “Ye
shall not have gone over the cities of Israel,” he told his followers,
“till the Son of Man is come .” 73 Later he deferred it a bit: “There be
some standing here that shall not taste of death till they see the Son
of Man coming in the Kingdom”; 74 and “this generation shall not pass
till all these things be</p>
<p>famines and earthquakes . . . many shall be offended, and . . . shall
hate one another. Many false prophets will appear, many will be misled
by them; and because of the increase of wickedness most men’s love will
grow cold .” 77 Sometimes Jesus made the advent of the Kingdom depend
and wait upon the conversion of man to God and justice; usually he made
its coming an act of God, a sudden and miraculous gift of divine
grace.</p>
<p>Many have interpreted the Kingdom as a communist utopia, and have
seen in Christ a social revolutionist . 78 The Gospels provide some
evidence for this view. Christ obviously scorned the man whose chief
purpose in life is to amass money and luxuries . 79 He promised hunger
and woe to the rich and filled, and comforted the poor with Beatitudes
that pledged them the Kingdom. To the rich youth who asked what he
should do besides keeping the commandmen ts, Christ answered: “Sell your
property, give your money to the poor, and . . . follow me.” 80
Apparently the apostles interpreted the Kingdom as a revolutionary
inversion of the existing relationships be- tween the rich and the poor;
we shall find them and the early Christians forming a communistic band
which “had all things in common.” 81 The charge on which Jesus was
condemned was that he had plotted to make himself “King of the
Jews.”</p>
<p>But a conservative can also quote the New Testament to his
purpose.</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>Christ made a friend of Matthew, who continued to be an agent of the
Roman power; he uttered no criticism of the civil government, took no
known part in the Jewish movement for national liberation, and counseled
a submissive gentleness hardly smacking of political revolution. He
advised the Pharisees to “render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” 82 His story of the
man who, before going on a journey, “called on his slaves, and put his
property in their hands,” 88 contains no complaint against interest or
slavery, but takes these institu- tions for granted. Christ apparently
approves of the slave who invested the ten minas (00) that the master
had entrusted to him, and made ten more; he disapproves of the slave
who, left with one mina, held it in unproductive safekeeping against the
master’s return; and he puts into the master’s mouth the hard saying
that “to him who has, more will be given, and from him who has nothing,
even that which he has will be taken away” 84 — an ex- cellent summary
of market operations, if not of world history. In another parable
workers “grumbled at their employer,” who paid as much to one who had
labored an hour as to those who had toiled all day; Christ makes the
employer answer: “Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my
own?” 85 Jesus does not seem to have thoughr of ending poverty; “the
poor ye have always with you.” He takes for granted, like all ancients,
that a slave’s duty is to serve his master well; “blessed is the slave
whom his master, returning, finds performing his charge.” 80 He is not
concerned to attack existing economic or political institutions; on the
contrary, he condemns those ardent souls w ho would “take the Kingdom of
Heaven by storm.” 87 The revolution he sought was a far deeper one,
without which reforms could only be superficial and transitory. If he
could cleanse the human heart of selfish desire, cruelty, and lust,
utopia would come of itself, and all those institutions that rise out of
human greed and violence, and the consequent need for law, would
disappear. Since this would be the profoundest of all revolutions,
beside which all others would be mere coups d’etat of class ousting
class and exploiting in its turn, Christ was in this spiritual sense the
greatest revolutionist in history.</p>
<p>His achievement lay not in ushering in a new state, but in outlining
an ideal morality. His ethical code was predicated on the early coming
of the Kingdom, 88 and was designed to make men worthy of entering it.
Hence the Beatitudes, with their unprecedented exaltation of humility,
poverty, gentleness, and peace; the counsel to turn the other cheek, and
be as little children (no paragons of virtue!); the indifference to
economic provision, property, government; the preference of celibacy to
marriage; the com- mand to abandon all family ties: these were not rules
for ordinary life, they</p>
<p>JESUS</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl)</p>
<p>567</p>
<p>were a semimonastic regimen fitting men and women for election by God
into an imminent Kingdom in which there would be no law, no marriage, no
sexual relations, no property, and no war. Jesus praised those who
“leave house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,” even those
“who make themselves eunuchs, for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake”; 80
obviously this was intended for a devoted religious minority, not for a
continuing society. It was an ethic limited in purpose but universal in
its scope, for it applied the conception of brotherhood and the Golden
Rule to foreigners and ene- mies as well as to neighbors and friends. It
visioned a time when men would worship God not in temples but “in spirit
and truth,” in every deed rather</p>
<p>Were these moral ideas new? Nothing is new except arrangement. The
central theme of Christ’s preaching— the coming Judgment and Kingdom —
was already a century old among the Jews. The Law had long since in-
culcated brotherhood: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” said
Leviticus; even “the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you
as one bom among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.” 00 Exodus had
commanded the Jews to do good to their enemies: a good Jew will restore
the straying ox or a ss even of the “enemy that hateth thee.” 91 The</p>
<p>prophets, too, had ranked a good life above all ritual; and Isaiah 04
and Hosea 95 had begun to change Yahveh from a Lord of Hosts into a God
of Love. Hillel, like Confucius, had phrased the Golden Rule. We must
not hold it against Jesus that he inherited and used the rich moral lore
of his people.</p>
<p>For a long time Christ thought of himself purely as a Jew, sharing
the ideas of the prophets, continuing their work, and preaching like
them only to Jews. In dispatching his disciples to spread his gospel he
sent them only to Jewish cities; “go not into the way of the gentiles,
nor into the city of the Samaritans”; 00 hence the apostles, after his
death, hesitated to bring the Good News to the “heathen” w orld. 07 When
he met the Samaritan woman at the well he told her, “Salvation is of the
Jews” ° 8 — though we must not judge him from words perhaps put into his
mouth by one who was not present, and who wrote sixty years after the
event. When a Ca- naanite woman asked him to heal her daughter, he at
first refused, saying “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” 09
He told the leper whom he had cured to “go to the priest and . . . offer
the gift that Moses pre -</p>
<p>scribed.” 100 “Do everything that t he scribes and Pharisees tell
you, and observe it all; but do not do as they do.” 101 In suggesting
modifications and mitigations of the Judaic Law Jesus, like Hillel, did
not think that he was overthrowing it; “I came not to destroy the Law of
Moses bu t to fulfill</p>
<p>5^8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>it.” 102 “It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one
tittle * of the Law to fail.” 103 f</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he transformed everything by the force of his character
and his feeling. He added to the Law the injunction to prepare for the
Kingdom by a life of justice, kindliness, and simplicity. He hardened
the Law in matters of sex and divorce , 105 but softened it toward a
readier for- giveness , 108 and reminded the Pharisees that the Sabbath
was made for man . 107 He relaxed the code of diet and cleanliness, and
omitted certain fasts. He brought religion back from ritual to
righteousness, and condemned con- spicuous prayers, showy charities, and
ornate funerals. He left the im- pression, at times, that the Judaic Law
would be abrogated by the coming of the Kingdom . 108</p>
<p>Jews of all sects except the Essenes opposed his innovations, and
especially resented his assumption of authority to forgive sins and to
speak in the name of God. They were shocked to see him associate with
the hated employees of Rome, and with women of low repute. The priests
of the Temple and the members of the Sanhedrin watched his activity with
suspicion; like Herod with John, they saw in it the semblance or cover
of a political revolu- tion; they feared lest the Roman procurator
should accuse them of neg- lecting their responsibility for maintaining
social order. They were a bit frightened by Christ’s promise to destroy
the Temple, and not quite sure that it was only a metaphor. For his part
Christ denounced them in sharp and bitter terms:</p>
<p>The scribes and Pharisees . . . put heavy loads of the Law upon</p>
<p>men’s shoulders, but they will not lift a finger to move them.
They</p>
<p>do everything they do to have men see it. They wear wide Scripture
texts as charms, and large tassels, and they like the best places at
din- ners and the front seats in the synagogues. . . . But alas for
you</p>
<p>hypocritical scribes and Pharisees . . . you blind guides . . .

<p>fools! . . . You let the weightier matters of the Law go —

<p>Was Jesus just to the Pharisees? Probably there were some among them
who deserved this castigation, many who, like numberless Christians a
few centuries later, substituted outward piety for inward grace. But
there were also many Pharisees who agreed that the Law should be
softened and hu- manized . 110 Very likely a large number of the sect
were sincere men, rea- sonably decent and honorable, who felt that the
ceremonial laws neglected by Jesus should be judged not in themselves
but as part of a code that served to hold the Jews together, in pride
and decency, amid a hostile world. Some of the Pharisees sympathized
with Jesus, and came to warn him that plots were being made to kill him
. 111 Nicodemus, one of the defenders of Jesus, was a rich Pharisee.</p>
<p>The final break came from Jesus’ growing conviction and clear
announce - ment that he was the Messiah. At first his followers had
looked upon him as the successor to John the Baptist; gradually they
came to believe that he was the long-awaited Redeemer who would raise
Israel out of Roman bondage and establish the reign of God on earth.
“Lord,” they asked him, “will you at this time restore the kingdom to
Israel?” 112 He put them off by saying, “It is not for you to know the
times and seasons which the Father</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>570</p>
<p>(chap. XXVI</p>
<p>peal to the people, “the whole throng of his disciples” greeted him
with the words, “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord”;
and when some Pharisees asked him to reprove this salutation, he
answered, “I tell you, if they keep silence, the stones will cry out.”
120 The Fourth Gospel reports that the crowd hailed him as “King of
Israel.” 121 Apparentl y his followers still thought of him as a
political Messiah, who would overthrow the Roman power and make Judea
supreme. It was these acclamations that doomed Christ to a
revolutionist’s death.</p>
<p>V. DEATH AND TRANSFIGURATION</p>
<p>The Feast of the Passover was at hand, and great numbers of Jews were
gathering in Jerusalem to offer sacrifice in the Temple. The outer court
of the shrine was noisy with vendors selling doves and other sacrificial
animals, and with money-changers offering locally acceptable currency
for the idolatrous coins of the Roman realm. Visiting the Temple on the
day after his entry into the city, Jesus was shocked by the clamor and
commercial- ism of the booths. In a burst of indignation he and his
followers overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the dove
merchants, scattered their coins on the ground, and with “a scourge of
rods” drove the traders from the court. For several days thereafter he
taught in the Temple, unhin- dered; 122 but at night he left Jerusalem
and stayed on the Mount of Olives, fearing arrest or assassination.</p>
<p>The agents of the government — civil and ecclesiastical, Roman and
Jew- ish — had kept watch on him probably from the time when he had
taken</p>
<p>Some news of this decision seems to have reached Jesus, perhaps
through members of the Sanhedrin minority. On the fourteenth day of the
Jewish month of Nisan (our April third), probably in the year 30,* Jesus
and his</p>
<p>• There is much dispute about the duration of Christ’s mission, a: id
the year of his death.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVl) JESUS 571</p>
<p>apostles ate the Seder, or Passover supper, in the home of a friend
in Jerusa- lem. They looked to the Master to free himself by his
miraculous powers; he, on the contrary, accepted his fate, and perhaps
hoped that his death would be received by God as a sacrificial atonement
for the sins of his peo- ple . 124 He had been informed that one of the
Twelve was conspiring to betray him; and at this last supper he openly
accused Judas Iscariot.* In accord with Jewish ritual Jesus blessed (in
Greek, eucharistisae ) the wine that he gave the apostles to drink; and
then they sang together the Jewish ritual song Hallel . 121 He told
them, says John, that he would be with them “only a little longer . … I
give you a new command: Love one another. . . . Let not your hearts be
troubled. Believe in God and believe in me. In my Father’s house are
many mansions … I go to prepare a place for you .” 128 It seems quite
credible that in so solemn a mome nt he should ask them to repeat this
supper periodically (as Jewish custom required), in commemoration of
him; and not improbable that, with Oriental intensity of feeling and
imagery, he asked them to think of the bread they ate as his body, and
of the wine they drank as his blood.</p>
<p>That night, we are told, the little band hid in the Garden of
Gethsemane, outside Jerusalem. There a detachment of Temple 129 police
found them, and arrested Jesus. He was taken first to the house of
Annas, a former high priest, then to that of Caiaphas; according to Mark
the “Council”— prob- ably a committee of the Sanhedrin — had already
gathered there. Various witnesses testified against him, especially
recalling his threat to destroy the Temple. When Caiaphas asked him
whether he was “the Messiah, the Son of God,” Jesus is reported to have
answered “I am he .” 130 In the morning the Sanhedrin met, found him
guilty of blasphemy (then a capital crime) , and decided to bring him
before the Roman procurator, who had come to Jerusalem to keep an eye on
the Passover crowds.</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate was a hard man, who would later be summoned to Rome,
accused of extortion and cruelty , 131 and removed from office.
Nevertheless, it did not seem to him that this mild-mannered preacher
was a real danger to the state. “Are you the King of the Jews?” he
asked. Jesus, says Mat - thew , 132 answered ambiguously, “You have said
it ( su eipas ) .” Such details, reported presumably from hearsay and
long after the event, must be held suspect; if we accept the text we
must conclude that Jesus had resolved to die, and that Paul’s theory of
atonement had some support in Christ. John</p>
<p>upon his own statements in Galatians 1-11, the chronology of the
procurators who tried him, and the trad ition of his death in 64,
apparently require the dating of Paul’s conversion in 31. Cf. Chapter
XXVII.</p>

<p>57 2 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVI</p>
<p>quotes J esus as adding: “For this I was bom … to give testimony
for</p>
<p>the truth.” “What is truth?” asked the procurator 133 — a question
perhaps due to the metaphysical propensities of the Fourth Gospel, but
well re- vealing the chasm between the sophisticated and cynical culture
of the Roman and the warm and trustful idealism of the Jew. In any case,
after Christ’s confession, the law required conviction, and Pilate
reluctantly is - sued the sentence of death.</p>
<p>Crucifixion was a Roman, not a Jewish, form of punishment. It was
usu- ally preceded by scourging, which, carried out thoroughly, left the
body a mass of swollen and bloody flesh. The Roman soldiers crowned
Christ with a wreath of thorns, mocking his royalty as “King of the
Jews,” and placed upon his cross an inscription in Aramaic, Greek, and
Latin: Iesus Nazarathaeus Rex loudaeorum. Whether or not Christ was a
revolutionist he was obviously condemned as one by Rome; Tacitus, too,
understood the matter so. 134 A small crowd, such as could gather in
Pilate’s courtyard, had called for Christ’s execution; now, however, as
he climbed the hill of Gol - gotha, “he was followed by a great crowd of
the people,” says Luke, 135 and of women who beat their breasts and
mourned for him. Quite clearly the condemnation did not have the
approval of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>All who cared to witness the horrible spectacle were free to do so;
the Romans, who thought it necessary to rule by terror, chose, for
capital offenses by other than Roman citizens, what Cicer o called “the
most cruel and hideous of tortures.” 130 The offender’s hands and feet
were bound (seldom nailed) to the wood; a projecting block supported the
backbone or the feet; unless mercifully killed, the victim would linger
there for two or three days, suffering the agony of immobility, unable
to brush away the insects that fed upon his naked flesh, and slowly
losing strength until the heart failed and brought an end. Even the
Romans sometimes pitied the vic- tim, and offered him a stupefying
drink. The cross, we are told, was</p>
<p>raised “at the third hour”— i.e., at nine in the morning. Alark
reports that two robbers were crucified with Jesus, and “reviled him”;
137 Luke assures us that one of them prayed to him. 133 Of all the
apostles only John was present; with him were three Marys — Christ’s
mother, her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene; “there were also some women
watching from a dis - tance.” 139 Following the Roman custom, 140 the
soldiers divided the gar - ments of the dying men; and as Christ had but
one, they cast lots for it. Possibly we have here an interpolated
remembrance of Psalm xxn, 1 8 : “They part my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture.” The same Psalm begins with the words: “My
God, my God, why hast thou forsak en me?”— and this is the desperately
human utterance that Mark and Matthew</p>

<p>great faith that had sustained him before Pilate faded into black
doubt? Luke, perhaps finding such words repugnant to the theology of
Paul, substi- tutes for them: “Father, into thy hands I commend my
spirit”— which in turn echoes Psalm xxxi, 5 with suspicious
accuracy.</p>
<p>A soldier, pitying Christ’s thirst, held up to his mouth a sponge
soaked in sour wine. Jesus drank, and said, “It is consummated.” At the
ninth hour — at three in the afternoon — he “cried out with a loud
voice, and gave up the ghost.” Luke adds— again revealing the sympathy
of the Jewish popu- lace — that “al l the people that came together to
that sight . . . smote their breasts and returned” to the town. 141 Two
kindly and influential Jews, hav - ing secured Pilate’s permission, took
the body down from the cross, em - balmed it with aloes and myrrh, and
placed it in a tomb.</p>
<p>Was he really dead? The two robbers beside him were still alive;
their legs were broken by the soldiers so that the weight of the body
would hang upon the hands, constricting the circulation and soon
stopping the heart. This was not d one in Jesus’ case, though we are
told that a soldier pierced his breast with a lance, drawing forth first
blood and then lymph. Pilate expressed surprise that a man should die
after six hours of crucifixion; he gave his consent to Christ’s removal
from the cross only when the centurion in charge assured him of Christ’s
death.</p>
<p>Two days later Mary Magdalene, whose love of Jesus partook of that
nervous intensity which characterized all her feelings, visited the tomb
with “Mary the mother of James, and Salome.” They found it ( empty.
“Frightened and yet overjoyed,” they ran to tell the news to the
disciples. On the way they met one whom they thought to be Jesus; they
bowed down before him and clasped his feet. We can imagine the hopeful
in- credulity with which their report was greeted; the thought that
Jesus had triumphed over death, and had thereby proved himself Messiah
and Son of God, filled the “Galileans” with such excitement that they
were ready for any miracle and any revelation. That same day, we are
told, Christ ap- peared to two disciples on the road to Emmaus, talked
with them, and ate with them; for a long time “they were prevented from
recognizing him”; but when “he took the bread and blessed it . . . their
eyes were opened, and t hey knew him, and he vanished from them.” 142
The disciples went back to Galilee, and soon thereafter “saw him and
bowed down before him, though some were in doubt.” 143 While they were
fishing they saw Christ join them; they cast their nets, and drew in a
great haul. 144</p>
<p>Forty days after his appearance to Mary Magdalene, says the beginning
of the Book of Acts, Christ ascended physically into heaven. The idea of
a saint being so “translated” into the sky in body and life was familiar
to the</p>

<p>Jews; they told it of Moses, Enoch, Elijah, and Isaiah. The Master
went as mystically as he had come; but most of the disciples seem to
have been sincerely convinced that he had, after his crucifixion, been
with them in the flesh. “They went back with great joy to Jerusalem,”
says Luke , 148 “and were constantly in the Temple, blessing God.”</p>
