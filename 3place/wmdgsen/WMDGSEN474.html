<h4 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h4>
<p>England in the Fifteenth Century</p>
<p>1399-1509</p>
<p>I. KINGS</p>
<p>H ENRY IV, having reached the throne, found himself challenged by</p>
<p>revolt. In Wales Owain Glyn Dwr overthrew the English domi-</p>
<p>nation for a moment (1401-08), but the future Henry V, now Prince of
Wales, overcame him with dashing strategy; and Owen Glendower, after
leading a hunted life for eight years in Welsh fastnesses and crags,
died a few hours after receiving full pardon from his gallant conqueror.
Synchro- nizing his rebellion with Glendower’s, Henry Percy, Earl of
Northumber - land, led some nobles of the north into an uprising against
a king unable to keep all the promises he had made to them for their aid
in deposing Richard II. The Earl’s reckless son Harry “Hotspur”
(unwarrantably lovable in</p>
<p>Shakespeare) led a hesitant and inadequate force against the King at
Shrews- bury ( 1 403 ) ; there the youth died in foolish heroism, Henry
IV fought man- fully in the front ranks, and his gay wastrel son,
“Prince Hal,” displayed the bravery that would win Agincourt and France.
These and other troubles left Henry little time or zest for
statesmanship; his revenues limped behind his expenditures; he quarreled
tactlessly with Parliament, and ended his reign amid fiscal chaos and
the personal tribulations of leprosy, prolapse of the rectum, and
venereal disease. 1 “He departed to God,” says Holinshed, “in the year
of his age forty- six … in great perplexity and little pleasure.” 2</p>
<p>In tradition and Shakespeare Henry V had lived a free and frolicsome
youth, and had even conspired to seize the throne from a father
incapacitated by illness but tenacious of power. Contemporary
chroniclers merely hint at his revels, but assure us that after his
accession “he was changed into an - other man, studying to be honest,
grave, and modest.” 8 He who had romped with topers and tarts now
dedicated himself to leading a united Christendom against the advancing
Turks — adding, however, that he must first conquer France. He
accomplished his proximate aim with astonishing speed, and for a
precarious moment an English king sat on the throne of France. German
princes sent him homage, and thought of making him emperor. 4 He rivaled
Caesar briefly in the planning of campaigns, the provisioning of his
armies, the affection of his troops, and in exposing himself in all
battles and weathers.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY IO7</p>
<p>Suddenly, still a youth of thirty-five, he died of fever at
Bois-de-Vincennes</p>
<p>0422).</p>
<p>His death saved France, and almost ruined England. His popularity
might have persuaded the taxpayers to rescue the government from
bankruptcy; but his son Henry VI was, at accession, only nine months
old, and a dis- graceful sequence of corrupt regents and inept generals
sank the treasury into irredeemable debt. The new ruler never rose to
royal stature; he was a delicate and studious neurasthenic who loved
religion and books, and shud- dered at the thought of war; the English
mourned that they had lost a king and won a saint. In 1452, imitating
Charles VI of France, Henry VI went mad. A year later his ministers
signed a peace acknowledging England’s de - feat in the Hundred Years’
War.</p>
<p>Richard, Duke of York, governed for two years as Protector; in a
cloudy- lucid interval Henry dismissed him (1454); the angry Duke
claimed the throne through descent from Edward III; he branded the
Lancastrian kings as usurpers, and joined Salisbury, Warwick, and other
barons in those Wars of the Roses — Lancastrian red and Yorkist white —
which through thirty-one years (1454-85) pitted noble against noble in
the indefatigable suicide of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy, and left
England impoverished and desolate. Soldiers demobilized by unwonted
peace, and loath to resume the chores of peasantry, enlisted on either
side, plundered the villages and towns, and murdered without qualm all
who stood in their way. The Duke of York was killed in battle at
Goldsmith’s Wakefield (1460), but his son Edward, Earl of March, carried
on the war remorselessly, slaughtering all captives, with or without
pedigree; while Margaret of Anjou, the virile queen of the gentle Henry,
led the Lancastrian resistance with unblushing ferocity. March won at
Towton (1461), ended the Lancastrian dynasty, and became, as Edward IV,
the first Yorkist king.</p>
<p>But the man who really ruled England for the next six years was
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. Head of a rich and numerous clan,
possessed of a dominating and yet engaging personality, as subtle in
statesmanship as he was brilliant in war, “Warwick the Kingmaker” had
fathered the victory at Towton, and had raised Edward to the throne. The
King, resting from strife, dedicated himself to women, while Warwick
governed so well that all Eng- land south of the Tyne and east of the
Severn (for Margaret was still fight- ing) honored him as in all but
name the king. When Edward rebelled against the reality and turned
against him, Warwick joined Margaret, drove Edward from England,
restored Henry VI to nominal power (1470), and ruled again. But Edward
organized an army with Burgundian aid, crossed to Hull, defeated and
slew Warwick at Barnet, defeated Margaret at Tewkesbury ( 147 1 ), had
Henry VI murdered in the tower, and lived happily ever after- ward.</p>
<p>io8</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>He was still only thirty-one. Comines describes hi m as “one of the
hand - somest men of his age,” who “took no delight in anything but
ladies, dancing, jntertainment, and the chase.” B He replenished his
treasury by confiscating the estates of the Nevilles, and by accepting
from Louis XI, as bribes to peace, 125,000 crowns and a promise of
50,000 more per year. 6 So eased, he could ignore a Parliament whose
only use to him would have been to vote him funds. Feeling himself
secure, he surrendered himself again to luxury and indolence, wore
himself out lovingly, grew fat and jolly, and died at forty-one in the
amplitude of his person and his power ( 1483 ) .</p>
<p>He left two sons: the twelve-year-old Edward V, and Richard, Duke of
York, aged nine. Their uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had for the
past six years served the state as chief minister, and with such
industry, piety, and skill that when he made himself regent England
accepted him without pro- test, despite his “ill -featured limbs,
crooked back, hard-favored visage, and left shoulder much higher than
his right.” 7 Whether through the intoxication of power, or a just
suspicion of conspiracies to unseat him, Richard im- prisoned several
notables, and executed one. On July 6, 1483, he had himself crowned as
Richard III, and on July 15 the two young princes were mur- dered in the
Tower — no one knows by whom. Once again the nobility rose in revolt,
this time led by Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond. When their modest forces
met the King’s far larger army on Boswor th Field (1485), most of
Richard’s soldiers refused to fight; and— lacking both a kingdom and a
horse — he died in a desperate charge. The Yorkist dynasty ended; the
Earl of Richmond, as Henry VII, began the Tudor line that would close
with Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Under the blows of necessity Henry developed the virtues and vices
that seemed to him demanded by his place. Holbein pictured him in a
Whitehall fresco: tall, slender, beardless, pensive, humane, hardly
revealing the subtle, secret calculation, the cold, stern pride, the
flexible but patiently obdurate will that brought England from its
destitute disintegration under the sixth Henry to its wealth and
concentrated power under the eighth. He loved “the felicity of full
coffers,” says Bacon, 8 because h e knew their persuasive- ness in
politics. He taxed the nation ingeniously, bled the rich with “benevo -
lences” or forced gifts, made avid use of fines to feed his treasury and
discourage crime, and winked as judges fitted the fine not to the
offense but to the purse. He was the first English king since 1216 who
kept his expenses within his income, and his charities and generosities
mitigated his parsimony. He devoted himself conscientiously to
administration, and skimped his pleas- ures to complete his toil. His
life was darkened with perennial suspicion, not without cause; he
trusted no one, concealed his purposes, and by fair means or dubious he
achieved his ends. He established the Court of Star Chamber to try, in
secret sessions, obstreperous nobles too powerful to fear local
judges</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY I09</p>
<p>or juries; and year by year he brought the ruined aristocracy and the
fright- ened prelacy into subordination to the monarchy. Strong
individuals re- sented the decline of liberty and the desuetude of
Parliament; but peasants forgave much in a king who disciplined their
lords, and manufacturers and merchants thanked him for his wise
promotion of industry and trade. He had found an England in feudal
anarchy, a government too poor and dis- reputable to win obedience or
loyalty; he left to Henry VIII a state re- spected, orderly, solvent,
united, and at peace.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GROWTH OF ENGLISH WEALTH</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently nothing had been gained by the Great Revolt of 1381. Many
servile dues were still exacted, and as late as 1537 the House of Lords
re- jected a bill for the final manumission of all serfs. 9 The
enclosure of “com - mons” was accelerated; thousands of displaced serfs
became propertyless proletarians in the towns; the sheep, said Thomas
More, were eating up the peasantry. 10 In some ways the movement was
good: lands approaching ex- haustion were renitrogenated by the grazing
sheep, and by 1 500 only 1 per cent of the population were serfs. A
class of yeomen grew, tilling their own land, and gradually giving to
the English commoner the sturdy independent character that would later
forge the Commonwealth and build an unwritten constitution of
unprecedented liberty.</p>
<p>Feudalism became unprofitable as industry and commerce spread into a
national and money economy bound up with foreign trade. When the serf
produced for his lord he had scant motive for expansion or enterprise;
when the free peasant and the merchant could sell their product in the
open market the lust for gain quickened the economic pulse of the
nation; the villages sent more food to the towns, the towns produced
more goods to pay for it, and the exchange of surpluses overflowed the
old municipal limits and guild restrictions to cover England and reach
out beyond the sea.</p>
<p>Some guilds became “merchant companies,” licensed by the King to sell
English products abroad. Whereas in the fourteenth century most English
trade had been carried in Italian vessels, the British now built their
own ships, and sent them into the North Sea, the coastal Atlantic, and
the Mediterran- ean. The Genoese and Hanseatic merchants resented these
newcomers, and fought them with embargoes and piracy; but Henry VII,
convinced that the development of England required foreign trade, took
English shipping under governmental protection, and arranged with other
nations commercial agreements that established maritime order and peace.
By x 500 the “mer - chant adventurers” of England ruled the trade of the
North Sea. With an eye to commerce with China and Japan, the farseeing
King commissioned</p>
<p>IIO THE REFORMATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>the Italian navigator Giovanni Caboto, then living in Bristol as John
Cabot, to seek a northern passage across the Atlantic ( 1497) . Cabot
had to be con- tent with discovering Newfoundland and, in a second
voyage (1498), ex- ploring the coast from Labrador to Delaware; he died
in that year, and his son Sebastian passed into the service of Spain.
Probably neither the sailor nor his King realized that these expeditions
inaugurated British imperialism, and opened to English trade and
colonists a region that would in time be Eng- land’s strength and
salvation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile protective tariffs nourished national industry; economic
order reduced the rate of interest sometimes to as low as 5 per cent;
and govern- mental decrees rigorously regulated wages and the conditions
of labor. A statute of Henry VII (1495) ruled</p>
<p>that every artificer and labourer be at his work, between the midst
of the month of March and the midst of the month of September, before
five o’clock in the morning, and that he have but half an hour for his
breakfast, and an hour and a half for his 〔midday〕 dinner, at such
time as he hath season for sleep . . . and that he depart not from work
. . . till between seven and eight of the clock in the evening. . . .
And that from the midst of September to the midst of March every
artificer and la- bourer be at their work in the springing of the day,
and depart not till night . . . and that they sleep not by day. 11</p>
<p>However, the worker rested and drank on Sundays, and on twenty-four
ad- ditional holidays in the year. “Fair prices” were set by the state
for many commodities, and we hear of arrests for exceeding these
figures. Real wages, in relation to prices, were apparently higher in
the late fifteenth century than in the early nineteenth. 12</p>
<p>The revolts of English labor in this age stressed political rights as
well as economic wrongs. Semi-communistic propaganda continued in almost
every year, and workingmen were repeatedly reminded that “you be made of
the same mold and metal that the gentles be made of; why then should
they sport and play, and you labor and toil? — why should they have so
much of the prosperity and treasure of this world, and ye so little?” 13
Riots against en - closures of common lands were numerous, and there
were periodic conflicts between merchants and artisans; but we hear too
of agitations for municipal democracy, for the representation of labor
in Parliament, and for a reduction of taxes. 14</p>
<p>In June 1450, a large and disciplined force of peasants and town
laborers marched upon London and camped at Blackheath. Their leader,
Jack Cade, presented their grievances in an orderly document. “All the
common people, what for taxes and tallages and other oppressions, might
not live by their handiw ork and husbandry.” 15 The Statute of Labourers
should be repealed.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>and a new ministry should be formed. The government accused Cade of
advocating communism.* 16 The troops of Henry VI, and the retainers of
certain nobles, met the rebel army at Sevenoaks (June 18, 1450) . To the
sur- prise of all, the rebels won, and poured into London. To appease
them the King’s Council ordered the arr est of Lord Saye and William
Crowmer, offi- cials especially hated for their exactions and tyranny.
On July 4 they were surrendered to the mob that besieged the Tower; they
were tried by the rebels, refused to plead, and were beheaded. According
to Holinshed the two heads were raised on pikes and carried through the
streets in joyous pro- cession; every now and then their mouths were
knocked together in a bloody kiss. 17 The Archbishop of Canterbury and
the Bishop of Winchester nego- tiated a peace, granting some demands and
offering amnesty. The rebels agreed and dispersed. Jack Cade, however,
attacked the castle of Queens- borough in Sheppey; the government
outlawed him, and on July 12 he was mortally wounded while resisting
arrest. Eight accomplices were condemned to death; the rest were
pardoned by the King, “to the great rejoicing of all his subjects.”

<li>MORALS AND MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Venetian ambassador, about 1500, reported to his government:</p>
<p>The English are for the most part — both men and women, of all ages —
handsome and well proportioned. . . . They are great lovers of them-
selves, and of everything belonging to them; they think there are no
other men than themselves, and no other world but England; and</p>
<p>whenever they see a handsome foreigner they say that “he looks like
an Englishman,” and that it is a great pity that he is not one . 19</p>
<p>The English might have answered that most of this description,
mutatis mutandis, would fit all peoples. Assuredly they were a vigorous
stock, in body, character, and speech. They swore so heartily that even
Joan of Arc regularly called them Goddams. The women too were
plainspoken, talking of matters physiological and genetic with a freedom
that might shock the sophisticates of today. 80 Humor was as coarse and
profane as speech. Man- ners were rough, even in the aristocracy, and
had to be trained and tamed by a rigid code of ceremony. The lusty
spirit that would agitate the Eliza- bethans was already formed, in the
fifteenth century, out of a life of danger, violence, and insolence.
Every man had to be his own policeman, ready to</p>

<p>112 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>meet blow with blow and, at need, kill with a steady stomach. These
same powerful animals could be generous, chivalrous, and, on occasion,
even ten- der. Tough warriors wept when Sir John Chandos, the almost
“parfit</p>
<p>knight,” died; and Margaret Paston’s letter to her sick husband (1443
) shows how timeless and raceless love can be. We should add, however,
that this same lady almost broke the head of her daughter for refusing
to marry the parental choice. 21</p>
<p>Girls were brought up in protective demureness and modesty, for men
were beasts of prey, and virginity was an economic asset in the marital
mart. Marriage was an incident in the transfer of property. Girls could
legally marry at twelve, boys at fourteen, even without their parents’
consent; but in the upper classes, to accelerate property transactions,
betrothals were ar- ranged by the parents soon after the children
reached the age of seven. Since love marriages were exceptional, and
divorce was forbidden, adultery was popular, especially in the
aristocracy. “There reigned abundantly,” says Holinshed, “the filthie
sin of lechery and fornication, with abominable adul - teries,
speciallie i n the king.” 22 Edward IV, after sampling many loves, chose
Jane Shore as his favorite concubine. She served him with wanton
fidelity, and proved a kind friend at court to many a petitioner. When
Edward died, Richard III, possibly to parade his brother’ s vices and
disguise his own, forced her to march through London streets in the
white robe of a public penitent. She lived to a destitute old age,
despised and rejected by those whom she had helped. 23</p>
<p>Never in known history had Englishmen (now so law-abiding) been so
lawless. A hundred years of war had made men brutal and reckless; nobles
returning from France continued to fight in England, and employed de-
mobilized soldiers in their feuds. Aristocrats shared with tradesmen a
greed for money that overrode all morality. Petty thefts were
innumerable. Mer- chants sold shoddy goods and used false weights; at
one time frauds in the quality and quantity of exports almost ruined
England’s foreign trade. 24 Commerce on the seas was spiced with piracy.
Bribery was almost universal: judges could scarcely judge without
“gifts”; juries were paid to be friendly to plaintiff or defendant or
both; tax collectors were “greased” to let exemp - tions slip readily
from their palms; recruiting offi cers, like Shakespeare’s Falstaff,
could be induced to overlook a town; 25 an English army invading France
was bought off by the enemy. 26 Men were as mad for money then as now,
and poets like Chaucer, having denounced greed, practiced it. The moral
structure of society might have collapsed had not its foundations been
mortised in the simple life of common men and women, who, while their
bet- ters plotted the wars and mischief of the time, maintained the home
and carried on the race.</p>
<p>All classes except merchants and proletaires lived in the country for
as</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 113</p>
<p>much of the year as they might. Castles, being no longer defensible
since the development of cannon, were slowly evolving into manor houses.
Brick replaced stone, but modest houses were still built of wood and
mud. The central hall, once used for all purposes, lost its old size and
splendor, and shrank into a vestibule opening into a large living room,
some small rooms, and a “drawte chamber” or (with) drawing room for
intimate converse. Tapestries hung on rich men’s walls, and windows—
sometimes of stained glass — brightened the once dark interior. The
smoke of the hearth, which formerly had escaped through window, door,
and roof, was now gathered into a chimney, and a massive fireplace
dignified the living room. Ceilings might be timbered, floors might be
tiled; carpets were still rare. If we may trust the literary rather than
accurate Erasmus,</p>
<p>almost all the floors are of clay and rushes from the marshes, so
care- lessly renewed that the foundation sometimes remains for
twenty</p>
<p>years, harboring, there below, spittle and vomit and wine of dogs and
men, beer . . . remnants of fishes, and other filth unnameable. Hence,
with the change of weather, a vapor exhales which in my judgment</p>

<p>Beds were sumptuous with carving, flowered coverlet, and canopy. The
dining table, in comfortable homes, was a giant masterpiece of carved
wal- nut or oak. Near it, or in the hall, stood a cupboard, sideboard,
or dresser where table plate was “dressed”— i.e., arranged for display
or ornament. The “parler”— a room for talking — was preferred for
meals.</p>
<p>To save oil, the main meals were taken in daylight: “dinner” at ten m
the morning, “supper” at five in the afternoon. Men wore their hats at
table, to keep their long hair from getting into the food. Forks were
reserved for special purposes, like serving salad or toasting cheese;
their English use in the modern manner first appears in 146 3. 28 The
knife was supplied by the guest, who carried it in a short sheath
attached to his girdle. Etiquette re- quired that food should be brought
to the mouth with the fingers. As hand kerchiefs were not in use till
the middle of the sixteenth century, men wer requested to blow their
noses with the hand that held the knife rather than with that which
conveyed the food. 29 Napkins were unknown, and diners were warned not
to clean their teeth on the tablecloth. 30 Meals were heavy; the
ordinary dinner of a man of rank included fifteen or twenty dishes.
Great lords kept great tables, feeding a hundred retainers, visitors,
and serv- ants daily; Warwick the Kingmaker used six oxen a day for his
table, and sometimes fed 500 guests. Meat was the national food;
vegetables were scarce or shunned. Beer and ale were the national
drinks; wine was not as plentiful or popular as in France or Italy, but
a gallon of beer per day was the usual allowance per person, even for
nuns. The English, said Sir John Fortescue</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>1 14</p>
<p>(chap. V</p>
<p>(cr. 1470), “drink no water, unless at certain times upon religious
score, or by way of doing penance.” 81</p>
<p>Dress was splendid in the aristocracy. Simple men wore a plain gown
or hood, or a short tunic convenient for work; moneyed men liked furred
and feathered hats, flowered robes, or fancy jackets bulging at the
sleeves, and tight high hose which, Chaucer’s parson complained, “shewen
. . . the horrible swollen members, that seemeth . . . hernia, and eke
the buttocks … as it were the hindre part of a she- ape in the fulle of
the moon.” Chaucer himself when a page, had a flaming costume with one
hose red and the other black The long pointed shoes of the fourteenth
century disappeared in the fif- teenth, and shoes became rounded or
broad at the toe. As for “the outrageous array of wommen, God wot that
though the visages of somme of them seem ful chaste and debonaire, yet
notifie they,” by “the horrible disordinate scantinesse” of their dress,
their “likerousnesse” (lecherousness) “and pride.” 32 However, the
pictures that have come down to us show the allur - ing sex tightly
encased in a plethora of garments from ears to feet.</p>
<p>Amusements ranged from checkers and chess, backgammon and dice, to
fishing and hunting, archery and jousts. Playing cards reached England
toward the end of the fifteenth century; today they still dress their
kings and queens in the fashion of that time. Dancing and music were as
popular as gambling; nearly every Englishman took part in choral song;
Henry V rivaled John Dunstable among the outstanding composers of the
day; and English singers were acclaimed on the Continent. Men played
tennis, hand- ball, football, bowls, quoits; they wrestled and boxed,
set cocks to fighting, baited bears and bulls. Crowds gathered to see
acrobats and ropewalkers perform the feats that amused antiquity and
amaze modernity. Kings and nobles kept jugglers, jesters, and buffoons;
and a Lord of Misrule, appointed by the king or queen, superintended the
sports and revels of Christmastide. Women moved freely among men
everywhere: drank in taverns, rode to the hounds, hunted with falcons,
and distracted the spectators from the combatants at tournaments; it was
they who, led by the queen, judged the jousters and awarded the golden
crown.</p>
<p>Travel was still travail, but nobody seemed to stay home — a bad mark
for monogamy. Roads were mud or dust, and robbers made no distinction of
race, sex, class, or creed. Inns were picturesque and dirty, stocked
with roaches, rats, and fleas. Nearly every one of them had a Doll
Tearsheet for sale, and virtue could hardly find a bed. The poor went on
foot, the well-to- do on horseback, usually in armed companies; the very
rich used newfangled horse-drawn coaches — reputedly invented by a
fifteenth-century Hungarian in the village of Kocz. Lordly carriages
were carved and painted and gilded, cushioned and curtained and
carpeted; even so they were less comfortable than camels, and as
undulant as a fishing smack. Ships were no better than</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>in antiquity, or worse; that which brought King John from Bordeaux to
Lon- don in 1357 took twelve days.</p>
<p>Crime flourished. Towns were too poor to have any but unpaid
volunteer police; but all males were required to join in the “hue and
cry” after a fleeing criminal. Deterrents were sought in severe
penalties for the few who were caught; burglary, larceny, arson, and
sacrilege, as well as murder and treason, were punished with hanging on
any convenient tree, and the corpse was left as a warning to others and
a feast for crows. The practice of torture — both on the accused and on
witnesses — developed under Edward IV, and continued for 200 years. 33
Lawyers abounded.</p>
<p>Perhaps we judge the age too harshly, forgetting the barbarities of
oui enlightened century. Sir John Fortescue, Chief Justice under Henry
VI, thought more highly of his time, and wrote in its honor two works
once re- nowned. In a dialogue, De laudibus legum Angliae, he praised
the laws of England, gloried in the right of trial by jury, mourned the
use of torture, and, like a thousand philosophers, warned princes to
make themselves the law-abiding servants of the people. In Monarchia, or
Governance of Eng- land, he compared France and England patriotically:
in France men could be condemned without public trial, the
States-General was rarely called, the King levied taxes on necessities
like salt and wine. After so exalting his coun - try, Sir John concluded
that all governments should be subject to the pope, usque ad pedum
oscula — ll tvt n to kissing his feet.” 34</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE LOLLARDS</li>
</ol>
<p>Archbishop Arundel, in 1407, reaffirmed the supremacy of canon or ec-
clesiastical law over all secular legislation, and condemned as a major
heresy any rejection of a papal decree. 33 Recovering from Wyclif, the
Church grew stronger in fifteenth-century England, and rising wealth
overflowed into its coffers. “Chantries” were now a frequent form of
contribution: persons expecting death paid for the building of a chapel
and for the chanting of Masses to expedite their souls into paradise. As
some twenty bishops and twenty-six abbots sat in the House of Lords with
only forty-seven laymen, the Church controlled the major chamber of
Parliament. To offset this, Henry VII — and later Henry VIII — insisted
on the right of the kings to nomi- nate the bishops and abbots of
England from the eligible clergy; and this dependence of the hierarchy
on the monarchy eased the clerical surrender to Henry VUI’s assertion of
r oyal supremacy over the English Church.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wyclif’s Poor Preachers continued to spread their
anticlerical ideas. As early as 1382 a monastic chronicler reported,
with frightened ex- aggeration, that “they multiplied exceedingly, like
budding pla nts, and filled</p>
<p>II 6 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>the whole realm. . . . You could scarce meet two men on the road but
thar one of them was a disciple of Wyclif 36 They found their readiest
audience among the industrial workers, especially the weavers of
Norfolk. In 1395 the Lollards felt strong enough to present to
Parliament a bold statement of their principles. They opposed clerical
celibacy, transubstantiation, image worship, pilgrimages, prayers for
the dead, the wealth and endowment of the Church, the employment of
ecclesiastics in state offices, the necessity of confession to priests,
the ceremonies of exorcism, and the worship of the saints. In other
pronouncements they recommended that all should read the Bible
frequently, and should follow its precepts as superior to the decrees of
the Church. They denounced war as unchristian, and luxury as immoral;
they called for sumptuary laws that would compel a return to simple
foods and dress; they abhorred oaths, and substituted for them such p
hrases as “I am sure/’ or “It is sooth”— i.e., truth; already the
Puritan mind and view were taking form in Britain. 37 A few preachers
mingled socialism with their religion, but most of them refrained from
attacking private property, and sought the support of knights and gentry
as well as of peasants and prole - taires.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the upper classes could not forget their narrow escape
from social revolution in 1381, and the Church found in them a new
readiness to protect her as a stabilizing force in the community.
Richard II threatened with arrest the representatives of the Lollards in
Parliament, and reduced them to silence. In 1397 the English bishops
petitioned the King for the execution of impenitent heretics “as in
other rea lms subject to the Christian religion,” 38 but Richard was
loath to go to such lengths. In 1401, however, Henry IV and his
Parliament issued the famous statute De haeretico com - burendo : all
persons declared by an ecclesiastical court to be persistent here- tics
were to be burned, and all heretical books w’ere to be destroyed. In
that same year William Sawtrey, a Lollard priest, was burned at the
stake. Other Lollards were arrested, recanted, and were treated
leniently. In 1406 the Prince of Wales presented to Henry IV a petition
alleging that the propa- ganda of the Lollards, and their attacks on
monastic property, threatened the whole existing fabric of society. The
King ordered a more vigorous prosecution of the heretics, but the
absorption of the bishops in the politics of the Papal Schism
temporarily deflected their energy from the hunt. In 1410 John Badby, a
Lollard tailor, was condemned by the Church, and was burned in
Smithfield Market. Before the faggots were lighted “Prince Hal” pleaded
with Badby to recant, and offered him life and money; Badby re- fused,
and mounted the pyre to his death. 39</p>
<p>The Prince came to the throne in 1413 as Henry V, and gave his full
sup- port to the policy of suppression. One of his personal friends was
Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, whom some of Shakespeare’s audience
later identi -</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY II7</p>
<p>fied with Falstaff. 40 Oldcastle had served the nation well in the
field, but he tolerated and protected Lollard preachers on his lands in
Herefordshire and Kent. Thrice the bishops summoned him to trial; thrice
he refused to come; he yielded, however, to a writ from the King, and
appeared before the bis hops (1413) in that chapter house of St. Paul’s
where Wyclif had stood trial thirty-six years before. He affirmed his
sincere Christianity, but would not reject the Lollard views on
confession or the Eucharist. He was con- demned as a heretic, and was c
onfined in the Tower of London; forty days’ grace was allowed him in the
hope that he would recant; instead he escaped. At the news the Lollards
around London rose in revolt, and tried to seize the King (1414). The
attempt failed, and some leaders were caught and hanged. Oldcastle hid
for three years in the mountains of Herefordshire and Wales; finally he
was captured, hanged as a traitor, and then burned as a heretic (1417),
state and Church both demanding their due.</p>
<p>As compared with other persecutions, that of Lollardry was almost
mod- erate; the executions for heresy numbered eleven between 1400 and
148 5. 41 We hear of several Lollard congregations surviving till 1521;
as late as 1518 Thomas Man, who claimed to have converted 700 to
Lollardry, suffered death at the stake; and six more were burned in
1521. 42 When Henry VIII divorced England from Rome, and the nation
accepted the change without revolution, the Lollards might have claimed
that in some measure they had prepared the way.</p>
<p>In 1450 Reginald Pecock, Bishop of Chichester, published a book which
he called, in the whimsical fashion of the times, Repressor of Overmuch
Blaming of the Clergy. It was avowedly a refutation of Lollardry, and
as- sumed a vigorous anticlericalism among the people. It proposed to
check these ideas not by imprisonment at the stake, but solely by an
appeal to reason. The enthusiastic bishop reasoned so much that he fell
in love with reason and in danger of heresy; he found himself refuting
by reason some Lollard arguments from Scripture. In a T reatise on Faith
he definitely placed reason above the Bible as a test of truth — a
position that Europe would take 200 years to regain. For good measure
the irrepressible Repressor added that the Fathers of the Church were
not always to be trusted; that Aristotle was not an unquestionable
authority; that the Apostles had had no hand in the Apostles’ Creed; and
that the Donation of Constantine was a forgery. 48 The English bishops
hailed the proud Pecock before their court ( 1457), and gave him a
choice between recanting or burning. He disliked burning, read a public
abjuration, was deposed from his see, and was segregated in Thomey Abbey
to the end of his days (1460).</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>V. ENGLISH ART: 1300-1509</p>
<p>Despite anticlericalism and heresy, religion was still sufficiently
fervent and opulent to raise English architecture to a minor peak of
excellence. The growth of commerce and the spoils of war financed
cathedrals, castles, and palaces, and glorified Oxford and Cambridge
with the fairest homes ever built for learning. From the marble of
Purbeck and the alabaster of Notting- ham to the forests of Sherwood and
the brick of any shire, the building mate- rials of England were
transformed into noble towers and lordly spires, and wooden ceilings
almost as strong and handsome as Gothic stone vaults. The ugly tie beam
that had crossed obtrusively from wall to wall was replaced by
hammer-beam projections supporting with massive shoulders of oak the
soaring arch above; in this manner some of England’s finest churches
spanned their naves. So Selby Cathedral received an oak ceiling of ribs
and bosses rivaling the lierne and fan designs that vaulted the abbey
church at Bath, the choir at Ely, and the south transept of Gloucester
with complex webs of stone.</p>
<p>Patterns in window tracery, wall paneling, and choir screens gave
their names to successive architectural styles, overlapping in time and
often min- gled in one edifice. Geometrical Decorated Gothic ( c . 1 2
50-c. 1315) used Euclidean forms, as in Exeter Cathedral. Curvilinear
Decorated Gothic ( c . 1 3 1 5-c. 1 380) abandoned definite figures for
freely flowing lines that antic- ipated with restraint the Flamboyant
style of France, as in the south rose window at Lincoln. Perpendicular
Gothic ( c . 1330-c. 1530) stressed hori- zontal and vertical lines
within the usual Gothic ogive, as in Henry VII’s Chapel at Westminster
Abbey. The intense colors of thirteenth-century stained glass were now
softened with lighter tints, or with silver stain or pale grisaille; and
in these windows the pageant of dying chivalry competed with the legends
of Christianity to let Gothic art reach its final splendor and de-
cline.</p>
<p>Seldom has England known such an ecstasy of construction. Three cen-
turies (1376-1517) labored to build the present nave of Westminster
Abbey; in the long gamut of those years we may weakly sense the toil of
mind and arm that went to make an unrivaled mausoleum for England’s best
-behaved geniuses. Only less impressive was the reconstruction of
Windsor: there Ed- ward III rebuilt on a massive scale the great Round
Tower ( 1 344), and Ed- ward IV began (1473) St. Geor ge’s Chapel, with
its lovely choir stalls, fan vault, and stained glass. Alan de
Walsingham designed in Curvilinear Gothic an exquisite Lady Chapel and
“lantern” tower for Ely. Gloucester Cathedral received a central tower,
a choir vault, a gorgeous east window, and spacious cloisters whose fan
vaults are among the wonders of England. Winchester</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY II9</p>
<p>extended its immense nave, and dressed its new front in
Perpendicular. Cov- entry built in that manner the cathedral that saved
only its stately spire in the second World War. Peterborough raised its
dizzy fan vault; York Minster completed its nave, west towers, and choir
screen. Towers were the crowning glory of the age, ennobling Merton and
Magdalen colleges at Ox- ford, Fountains Abbey, Canterbury, Glastonbury,
Derby, Taunton, and a hundred other shrines. William of Wykeham used
Perpendicular in design- ing New College, Oxford; William of Waynflete,
another nonagenarian, followed suit in the Great Quadrangle at Eton; and
Kings College, Cam- bridge, capped the age with a chapel whose windows,
vault, and choir stalls might reconcile Caliban to education, and Timon
of Athens to prayer.</p>
<p>There was a secular and matter-of-fact spirit in Perpendicular Gothic
that perfectly suited the civic architecture of colleges, castles,
fortresses, guild and city halls. It was in this style that the earls of
Warwick, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, raised their famous
castle near Leamington. The Guildhall of London, fane of the capital’s
mercantile pride, was built in 141 1 - 35, burned down in 1666, was
rebuilt by Christopher Wren, and received in 1866 the new interior that
succumbed to bombs in the second World War. Even the town shops took on,
in their mullioned windows, a Perpen- dicular pattern that conspires
with carved lintels, cornices, and projecting balconies to bewitch us
with the charm of a departing glory.</p>
<p>English sculpture maintained in this age its reputation for
mediocrity. The statuary made for church fagades, as at Lincoln and
Exeter, fell far short of the architecture it was intended to adorn. The
great altar screens in Westminster Cathedral and St. Alban’s Abbey serve
d as matrices for statues, but these are of too modest merit to add to
the burden of our tale. The best sculpture was on funerary monuments.
Fine figures were carved, usually in alabaster, of Edward</p>
<p>II in Gloucester Cathedral, of Dame Eleanor Percy in Beverly Minster,
of Henry IV and Queen Joan at Canterbury, of Richard Beauchamp at
Warwick. English sculptors were at their best in representing the
flowers and foliage of their verdant land. Good carving was done in
wood: the choir stalls of Winchester, Ely, Gloucester, Lincoln, Norwich
stop the breath with their laborious beauty.</p>
<p>Painting was still a minor art in England, lagging far behind
contemporary work in Flanders and France. Illumination remained a
favorite devotion; Edward</p>
<p>III paid £ 66 (,600?) for an illuminated volume of romances, 44 and
Robert of Ormsby presented to Norwich Cathedral an illuminated psalter
which the Bodle- ian Library ranks as “the finest English manuscript” in
its collections. After 1450 the art of the miniature declined with the
rise of mural and panel painting, and in the sixteenth century it faded
out before the novel miracle of print.</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>CAXTON AND MALORY</li>
</ol>
<p>At some unknown date in the fifteenth century a now nameless author
produced the most famous of English morality plays. Everyman is an alle-
gory whose characters are unprepossessing abstractions: Knowledge,
Beauty, Five- Wits, Discretion, Strength, Goods, Good Deeds, Fellowship,
Kindred, Confession, Death, Everyman, and God. In the prologue God
complains that His commandments are ignored by nine men out of ten six
days out of seven, and sends Death to remind the terrestrials that they
must soon come to Him and give an account of their doings. In the space
of a line Death de- scends from heaven to earth, finds Everyman
meditating earnestly on women and gold, and bids him come into eternity.
Everyman pleads unprepared- ness, asks for an extension of time, offers
a thousand-pound bribe; but Death grants him only one mitigation — to be
accompanied into eternity by some chosen friend. Everyman begs
Fellowship to join him in the great adventure, but Fellowship excuses
himself bravely:</p>
<p>If thou wilt eat, and drink, and make good cheer.</p>
<p>Or haunt together women’s lusty company,</p>
<p>I would not forsake you. . . .</p>
<p>Everyman: Then bear me company in my far journey.</p>
<p>Fellowship: Now, in good faith, I will not that way.</p>
<p>But if thou wilt murder, or any man kill,</p>
<p>In that I will help thee with a good will . 45</p>
<p>Everyman appeals to Kindred, his cousin, who rejects the invitation
because “I have the cramp in my toe.” Everyman calls upon Goods to aid
him; but Goods has been so firmly locked away that he cannot be freed to
render any help. At last Everyman entreats Good Deeds; she is pleased
that he has not quite forgotten her; she introduces him to Knowledge,
who leads him to Confession, who shrives him clean. Then Good Deeds
descends with Every- man into his grave, and angelic songs welcome the
purified sinner into para- dise.</p>
<p>The author almost, but not quite, triumphed over an ungainly dramatic
form. The personification of a quality can never qualify as a person,
for every man is an irritatingly complex contradiction, unique except
when part of a crowd; and great art must portray the general through the
unique, as through Hamlet or Quixote, Oedipus or Panurge. Experiment and
ingenuity would need another century to transform the dull morality play
into the living Elizabethan drama of infinitely variable man.</p>
<p>The great literary event in fifteenth-century England was the
establish- ment of its first printing press. Bom in Kent, William Caxton
migrated to</p>
<p>1 2 I</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>Bruges as a merchant. In his leisure he translated a collection of
French romances. His friends asked for copies, which he made himself;
but his hand, he tells us, became “weary and not steadfast with much
writing,” and his eyes were “dimed with overmuch lokying on the whit
paper.” 48 On his visits to Cologne, he may have seen the printing press
set up there ( 1466) by Ulrich Zell, who had learned the new technique
in Mainz. In 1471 Colard Mansion organized a printing shop in Bruges,
and Caxton resorted to it as a means of multiplying copies of his
translation. In 1476 he returned to Eng- land, and a year later he
installed at Westminster the fonts — perhaps the presses — that he had
brought from Bruges. He was already fifty-five, and only fifteen years
were left him; but in that period he printed ninety-eight books, several
of them translated by himself from the Latin or the French. His choice
of titles, and the quaint and charming style of his prefaces, laid a
lasting mark on English literature. When he died (1491) his Alsatian
asso- ciate, Wynkyn de Worde, carried on the revolution.</p>
<p>In 1485 Caxton edited and published one of the most lovable
masterpieces of English prose — T he Noble Histories of King Arthur and
of Certain of His Knights. Its strange author had died, probably in
prison, some sixteen years before. Sir Thomas Malory, in the Hundred
Years’ War, served in the retinue of Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of
Warwick, and represented War- wick in the Parliament of 1445. Lonesome
for the license of war, he broke into the home of Hugh Smyth, raped
Hugh’s wife, extorted a hundred shil - lings from Margaret Kyng and
William Hales, broke again into Hugh</p>
<p>Smyth’s house, and again raped the wife. He stole seven cows, two
calves, and 335 sheep, twice looted the Cistercian Abbey at Coombe, and
was twice clapped into jail. It seems incredible that such a man should
have written that tender swan song of English chivalry which we now call
Le Morte d’ Arthur; but after a century of dispute it is agreed that
these delightful romances were the product of Sir Thomas Malory’s
incarcerated years. 47 He took most of the stories from the French forms
of the Arthurian</p>
<p>legends, arranged them in tolerable sequence, and phrased them in a
style of wistful, feminine charm. To an aristocracy losing chivalry in
the brutalities and treacheries of war, he appealed for a return to the
high standards of Arthur’s knights, forgetting their transgressions and
his own. Arthur, after outgrowing fornication and incest, settles down
with his pretty but venture- some Guinevere, governs England — indeed,
all Europe — from his capital a Camelot (Winchester), and requires the
150 knights of his Round Table t pledge themselves</p>
<p>never to do outrage nor murder … by no means to be cruel, but to</p>
<p>give mercy unto him that asketh mercy . . . and always to do . . .
gen- tlewomen succour, upon pain of death . 48</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>Love and war are the mingled themes of a book resounding with the
combats of incomparable chevaliers for dames and damosels beyond
compare. Tris- tram and Lancelot cuckold their kings, but are the soul
of honor and bravery. Encountering each other armored, helmeted, and
visored, and hence with their identities concealed, they fight for four
hours, until their swords are incarnadined and dull.</p>
<p>Then at last spake Sir Lancelot and said: Knight, thou lightest
won-</p>
<p>derly well as ever I saw knight, therefore, an it please you, tell
me</p>
<p>your name. Sir, said Sir Tristram, that is me loath to tell any man
my name. Truly, said Sir Lancelot, an I were required, I was never
loath</p>
<p>to tell my name. It is well said, said Sir Tristram; therefore I
require</p>
<p>you to tell me your name. Fair knight, he said, my name is Sir
Lancelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Tristram, what have I done? for ye are
the man in the world that I love best. Fair knight, said Sir Lancelot,
tell me</p>
<p>your name. Truly, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. O Jesu,
said Sir Lancelot, what adventure is befallen me! And therewith Sir</p>
<p>Lancelot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword. And there-</p>

<p>What a leap it is from this airy realm, in which no one ever worked
for a living, and all women were “gentlewomen,” to the real matter
-of-fact world of the Paston Letters, those living missives that bound a
scattered family to- gether in affection and finance in the England of
the fifteenth century! Here is John Paston, who practices law in London
or on circuit while Margaret rears their children and manages his
property at Norwich; he is all business, stern, stingy, competent; she
is all submission, a humble, able, timid wife, who trembles at the
thought that she has offended him ; 80 such were the Guine- veres of the
actual world. And yet here too are delicate sentiments, mutual
solicitude, even romance; Margery Brews confesses to Sir John Paston II
that she loves him, and mourns that the dowry she can bring him falls
far below his state; “but if ye love me, as I trust verily ye do, ye

<li>THE ENGLISH HUMANISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>We must not wonder that the exuberance of classical scholarship in
the Italy of Cosimo and Lorenzo de’ Medici awoke only a timid echo in an
Eng -</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 123</p>
<p>land whose merchants cared little for letters, and whose nobles were
not ashamed of illiterate wealth. Sir Thomas More, at the outset of the
sixteenth century, reckoned that some 40 per cent of the English people
could read. 81 The Church and the universities which she controlled were
as yet the sole patrons of scholars. It is to the credit of England that
under these circum- stances, and amid the waste and violence of war, men
like Grocyn, Linacre, Latimer, and Colet were touched by the Italian
fire, and brought enough of its heat and light to England to make
Erasmus, Europe’s arbiter litterarum, feel at home when he came to the
island in 1499. The humanists, devoted to the study of pagan as well as
Christian culture, were denounced by a few ingrown “Trojans,” who feared
these “Greeks” bringing gifts from Italy; but they were bravely defended
and befriended by great churchmen like William of Waynflete, Bishop of
Winchester, William Warham, Arch- bishop of Canterbury, John Fisher,
Bishop of Rochester, and, later, Thomas Cardinal Wolsey, Chancellor of
England.</p>
<p>From the time when Manuel Chrysoloras visited England (1408), some
young English scholars caught a fever whose only cure, they felt, was
study or lechery in Italy. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, came back from
Italy with a passion for manuscripts, and collected a library that
afterward en- riched the Bodleian. John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester,
studied under</p>
<p>Guarino da Verona at Ferrara and John Argyropoulos at Florence, and
re- turned to England with more books than morals. In 1464-67 the monk
Wil- liam Tilley of Selling studied at Padua, Bologna, and Rome, brought
back many pagan classics, and taught Greek at Canterbury.</p>
<p>One of his fervent pupils there was Thomas Linacre. When Tilley went
again to Italy ( 1487), Linacre accompanied him, and remained twelve
years. He studied under Politian and Chalcondyles in Florence, edited
Greek works for Aldus Manutius in Venice, and returned to England so
accom- plished in diverse fields of learning that Henry VII summoned him
to tutor Arthur, Prince of Wales. At Oxford he and Grocyn and Latimer
constituted almost an Oxford Movement toward the classic languages and
literatures; their lectures inspired John Colet and Thomas More, and
attracted Erasmus himself. 52 Linacre was the most universal of the
English humanists, at home in Greek and Latin, translating Galen,
promoting scientific medicine, found- ing the Royal College of
Physicians and leaving his fortune to endow chairs of medicine at Oxford
and Cambridge. Through him, said Erasmus, the new learning was so
established in Britain that no Englishman need any longer go to study in
Italy. 83</p>
<p>William Grocyn was already forty when he joined Linacre in Florence.
Returning to England in 1492, he hired rooms in Exeter College, Oxford,
and lectured daily on Greek, over the protests of conservatives who
trem-</p>
<p>124 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>bled lest the original text of the New Testament should upset the
thousanu- year- old authority of Jerome’s Vulgate Latin translation. But
Grocyn was reassuringly orthodox in doctrine and rigidly upright in his
moral life. Eng- lish humanism never developed, as in some scholars of
the Italian Renais- sance, even a concealed hostility to Christianity;
it treasured the Christian heritage above all intellectual refinements,
and its most famous disciple found no embarrassment in being dean of
St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>John Colet was the eldest son of Sir Henry Colet, a rich merchant who
begot twenty-two children and served two terms as mayor of London. At
Oxford the youth caught the humanist fervor from Linacre and Grocyn, and
“eagerly devoured” Plato, Plotinus, and Cicero. In 1493 he traveled in
France and Italy, met Erasmus and Bude in Paris, was strongly moved by
Savonarola in Florence, and was shocked by the levity and license of
cardi- nals and Alexander VI in Rome. On his return to England, having
inherited his father’s wealth, he might have risen to high place in
business or politics, but he preferred scholastic life in Oxford.
Ignoring the tradition that only a priest might teach t heology, he
lectured on St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans; he replaced Scholastic
dialectic with criticism and elucidation of the Vulgate text; and his
large audiences felt refreshed by the novelty of his method, and by his
stress on the good life as the best theology. Erasmus, who saw him at
Oxford in 1499, described him as a saint perpetually tempted to lust and
luxury, but “keeping the flower of his virginity till his death,”
scorning the easygoing monks of his time, and dedicating his fortune to
pious uses and charity. 64</p>
<p>He was a loyal opposition in the Church, loving her despite her
faults. He questioned the literal truth of Genesis, but accepted the
divine inspiration of the Bible. He foreshadowed the Reformers in
stressing the authority of the Scriptures as against ecclesiastical
traditions and forms, in rejecting the Scholastic philosophy as an
intellectual dilution of simple Christianity, in doubting the
confessional powers of priests and the Real Presence of Christ in the
consecrated bread, and in denouncing the worldliness of the clergy:</p>
<p>If the highest bishop, whom we call the pope … be a lawful
bishop,</p>
<p>he of himself does nothing, but God in him. But if he do attempt any-
thing of himself, he is then a breeder of poison. . . . This has now in-
deed been done for many years past, and has by this time so increased as
to take powerful hold on all members of the Christian Church, so that
unless . . . Jesus lay to His hand with all speed, our most disordered
Church cannot be far from death. . . . Oh, the abominable impiety of
those miserable priests, of whom this age contains a great multitude,
who fear not to rush from the bosom of some foul harlot into the tem-
ple of the Church, to the altars of Christ, to the mysteries of God! On
them the vengeance of God will one day fall . 65</p>
<p>CHAP, v) ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 125</p>
<p>In 1504 Colet was appointed dean of St. Paul’s. From that high pulpit
he preached against the sale of bishoprics, and the evil of plural
benefices held by one man. He aroused an angry opposition, but
Archbishop Warham pro- tected him. Linacre, Grocyn, and More were now
established in London, free from the conservatism and scholasticism of
Oxford, stimulated by the visits of Erasmus, and soon to enjoy the
support of the young Henry VIII. Everything seemed prepared for an
English Renaissance that would move hand in hand with a peaceful
Reformation.</p>
