<h4 id="chapter-xi-napoleonic-france">CHAPTER XI Napoleonic France</h4>
<p>i 800 — 1 81 5</p>
<p>I. THE ECONOMY</p>
<p>T HOUGH raised to be a soldier, Napoleon had a sound sense of eco-
nomic realities as the fate of families, the subsoil of culture, and the
strength and weakness of a state. Generally, despite an itch to
regulate, he ranged himself on the side of free enterprise, open
competition, and private property. He paid little attention to the
socialistic plans of Charles Fourier and others for the communal
production of goods and the equitable distri- bution of the product. He
felt sure that in any society the abler minority will soon govern the ;
majority, and absorb the greater part of the wealth; moreover, the
inspiration of a communist ideal cannot long take the place of
differential rewards in reconciling men to toil; in frank analysis, “it
is hunger that makes the world move.” 1 Moreover, communal ownership is
a perpe tual temptation to carelessness. “Whilst an individual owner,
with a personal in - terest in his property, is always wide awake, and
brings his plans to fruition, communal interest is inherently sleepy and
unproductive, because individual enterprise is a matter of instinct, and
communal enterprise is a matter of pub- lic spirit, which is rare.” 2 So
he opened all doors, all careers, to all men, of whatever fortune or
pedigree; and until the later years of his rule France enjoyed a
prosperity that brought peace to all classes; there was.no unem-
ployment, 3 no political revolt. “Nobody is interested in overthrowing a
gov - ernment in which all the deserving are employed.” 4</p>
<p>It was a prime principle with Napoleon that state “finances fou nded
upon a good system of agriculture never fail.” 5 Overseeing everything,
overlook - ing nothing, he saw to it that protective tariffs, reliable
financing, and well- maintained transport by roads and canals should
encourage the peasants to labor steadily, to buy land, to bring more and
more of it under cultivation, and to provide sturdy youngsters for his
armies. Too many French farmers were sharecroppers or hired farm
laborers, but half a million of; them, by 1814, owned the acres that
they sowed. An English lady traveling in France in that year described
the peasants as enjoying a degree of prosperity un- known to their class
anywhere else in Europe. 6 These tillers of the soil looked to Napoleon
as a living guarantee of their title deeds, and remained loyal to him
until their lands languished in the absence of their conscripted
sons.</p>
<p>Industry too was a prime interest with Napoleon. He made it a point
to</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>visit factories, to show interest in processes and products, in the
artisans and the managers. He aspired to bring science to the service of
industry. He set up industrial exhibitions — in 1801 in the Louvre, and
in 1806 under immense tents in the Place des Invalides. He organized the
Lcole des Arts et Metiers, and rewarded inventors and scientists.
Experiments with steam propulsion were made in 1802 with a clumsy engine
on a barge in a canal near Paris; their success was not convincing, but
they spurred further efforts. In 1803 Robert Fulton offered a plan for
applying steam power to navigation; Napo- leon turned it over to the
Institut National, where, after two months of ex- periment, it was
rejected as impracticable. French industry developed more slowly than
the British, having fewer markets, less capital, and less machinery.
However,. in 1801, Joseph-Marie Jacquard exhibited his new apparatus for
weaving; in’ 1806 the French government bought the invention and dis -
tributed it; French textile industry became competitive with the
British. The silk industry in Lyons, which in 1800 had 3,500 looms, used
10,720 in 1808; 7 and in 1810 one textile entrepreneur employed eleven
thousand workers in his mills. 8 Meanwhile French chemists continued to
meet the British exclu- sion of sugar, cotton, and indigo by making
sugar from. beetroot, dyes from woad, and linens superior to cotton; 9
also they turned, potatoes into brandy.</p>
<p>Napoleon helped French industries with protective tariffs and the
Conti- nental Blockade, tided them over financial difficulties with
loans on easy terms, opened up new markets for French products in his
expanding empire, and took up any slack of employment by extensive
public works. Some of these were monuments to the glory of Napoleon and
his armies, like the Vendome Column, the Madeleine, and the triumphal
Arcs du Carrousel and de l’Ftoile; some were military fortifications or
facilities, like the fortress, dike, and port of Cherbourg; some were
utilitarian structures artistically de- signed; like the Bourse, the
Bank of France, the General Post Office, the Theatre de l’Odeon, even
the Halles des Bles or des Vins— the stately em- poriums of corn or
wines ( 1 8 1 1 ). Some were aids to agriculture, like the draining of
marshes; some to transport and trade. Here belong the opening of new
streets in Paris, like the Rues de Rivoli, de Castiglione, de la Paix,
and two miles of quais, like the Quai d’Orsay, along the Seine; more
impor - tant, 33,500 miles of new. roads in France, and countless-
bridges, including the Ponts d’Austerlitz and d’lena in Paris; add the
deepening of river beds and the extension of France’s magnificent system
of canals. Major canals were dug connecting Paris with Lyons, and
connecting Lyons with Stras- bourg and Bordeaux. Napoleon fell before
two othersystems could be com-</p>
<p>E leted: canals binding the Rhine with the Danube and the. Rhone, and
inding Venice with Genoa. 10</p>
<p>The workers who dug the canals, raised the triumphal arches, and
manned the factories were not allowed to go on strike, or to form unions
to bargain for better working conditions or higher pay. However,
Napoleon’s govern - ment saw to it that wages should keep abreast of
prices, that bakers and butchers and manufacturers were under state
regulation, and that — especially in Paris — the necessaries of fife
should be plentifully supplied. Until the last</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>years of Napoleon’s rule, wages rose faster than prices, and the
proletariat, sharing modestly in the general prosperity and proud of
Napoleon’s vic - tories, became more patriotic than the bourgeoisie. It
gave scant hearing to bourgeois liberals, like Mme. de Stael or Benjamin
Constant, preaching liberty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there were sources and voices of discontent. As free
enterprise progressively enriched the clever, some men perceived that
equality withers under liberty, and that a laissez-faire government
allows the concentration of wealth to exclude half of the population
from the fruits of invention and the graces of civilization. In 1808
Frangois-Marie Fourier issued his Theorie des quatre mouvements et des
destinees generates — the first classic of utopian socialism. He
proposed that those dissatisfied with the existing organization of
industry should unite in cooperative communities (phalanges) , each of
some four hundred families, living together in a phalanstery, or common
building; that all members should spend part of the working day in
agricul- ture (collectively organized), part in domestic or group
industry, part in leisure or cultural pursuits; that each individual
should perform a variety of tasks, and should change his occupation
occasionally; that each individual should share equally in the products
or profits of the phalanx; and that each phalanx should have a community
center, a school, a library, a hotel, and a bank. This plan inspired
idealists in both hemispheres, and Brook Farm, near Boston, was only one
of several utopian communities that were soon cut down by the natural
individualism of men.</p>
<p>Napoleon himself was not very fond of capitalism. He called the
Ameri- cans “mere merchants,” who “put all their glory into making
money.” 11 He encouraged French commerce by the multiplication and
maintenance of all avenues of transport and trade, and by the supply and
steadiness of money; but he discouraged it by the thousand and one
regulations of the Continental Blockade. Finally yielding to complaints,
he issued (1810-11) licenses for the export of certain goods to Britain,
and for the import of sugar, coffee, and other foreign products. He
charged for these licenses, and a good deal of favoritism and corruption
entered into their issuance. 12 Petty tradesmen fared better in France
than wholesale merchants as industry grew; stores were stocked beyond
French precedent as agriculture, industry, and trans- port expanded; and
frequented streets blossomed with colorful boutiques; but the great port
cities — Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, Le Havre, Antwerp, and Amsterdam
— were in decay, and the merchants were turning against Napoleon and his
blockade.</p>
<p>His greatest success as an administrator was in finance. Strange to
say, his wars, till 1812, usually brought in more than they cost; he put
upon his ene- mies the onus of beginning the action; and when he
defeated them he charged high fees — and Old Masters — for the lesson.
Part of these gleanings he kept under his personal control as a domaine
extraordinaire. He boasted in 18 1 1 that he had 300,000,000 gold francs
in the caves des Tuileries. 13 He used this fund to ease stringencies in
the Treasury, to correct dangerous</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>urns in the stock market, to finance public works or municipal
improve- ments, to reward signal services, to distinguish artists and
writers, to rescue embarrassed industries, to bribe a friend or an
enemy, and to pay for his secret police. Enough remained to prepare for
the next war, and to keep taxes far below their level under Louis XVI or
the Revolution. 14</p>
<p>“Before 1789,” says Taine, “the peasant proprietor paid, on 100
francs’ net income, 14 to the seignior, 14 to the clergy, 53 to the
state, and kept only 18 or 19 for himself; after 1800 he pays nothing of
his 100 francs of income to the seignior or the clergy; he pays little
to the state, only 25 francs to the commune and departement, and keeps
70 for his pocket.” 16 Befor e 1789 the manual worker had labored from
twenty to thirty-nine of his working days per year to pay his taxes;
after 1800, from six to nineteen days. “Through the almost complete
exemption [from taxes] of those who have no property, the burden of
direct taxation falls almost entirely on those who own prop- erty.” 16
However, there were many “extremely moderate” indirect or sales taxes,
which fell upon all persons equally, and were therefore harder on the
poor than on the rich. Toward the end of the imperial regime the costs
of war far exceeded its returns; taxes and prices rose, and public
discontent spread.</p>
<p>A crisis in finances in 1805 led Napoleon to reorganize the Bank of
France, which had been established in 1800 under private management.
While he was fighting for his political life at Marengo a group of
speculators led by Gabriel- Julien Ouvrard secured control of army
supplies. Running into difficulties, they appealed to the bank for a
considerable loan; to raise this money the bank, with the permission of
the Treasury, issued its own notes as legal currency; these failed to
win acceptance in financial transactions, and fell to ninety percent of
their face value; the company and the bank faced bankruptcy. On his
return to Paris Napoleon rescued the bank with part of the indemnities
received from Austria, but he insisted that hence- forth it be “under
control of the state, but not too much so.” On April 22, 1806, he placed
it under a governor and two vice-governors appointed by the government,
and fifteen regents chosen by the shareholders. This new Banque de
France opened branches at Lyons, Rouen, and Lille, and began a long
career of service to the French economy and the state. The govern- ment
still owns only a minority of the bank’s shares.</p>
<p>Napoleon had small respect for the men who sold supplies to his army
and ministries. He took it for granted that every contractor padded his
bills, and that some of them offered shoddy materials at first-rate
prices. He instructed his appointees to strictly check all bills
presented to them, and sometimes he did this himself. “All the
contractors,” he told Bourrienne, “all the provision agents, are
rogues…. They possess millions, roll in insolent luxury, while my
soldiers have neither bread nor shoes. I will have no more of that!” 17
At Vienna in 1809 he received complaints of defective clothing and
equip- ment sold to his army; he ordered an inquiry, which showed that
the con- tractors had made large undue profits in these sales; he
ordered a court-</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>martial; this condemned’ the embezzlers to death. Every influence was
made to save them, but Napoleon refused pardon, and the sentence was
carried out. 18</p>
<p>By and large, as hostile critics agree, 19 the.first thirteen years
of Napo- leon’s rule gave France the greatest prosperity She had ever
known. When Las Cases, a titled and forgiven emigre , returned in 1805
from a tour of sixty departements, he reported that “France had at no
period of her history been more powerful, more flourishing, better
governed, and happier.” 20 In 1813 the Comte de Montalivet, minister of
the interior, claimed that this continuing prosperity was due to “the
suppression of feudalism, titles, mort - main, and monastic; orders;… to
the more equal distribution of wealth, to the clearness and simpli
fication of the laws.” 21 In 1800 the population of France was
approximately 28 million; in 1813 it was 30 million. It&lt;does not seem
to be a startling gain, but if the same rate of growth (even uncom-
pounded) had continued till 1870 Napoleon’s nephew w ould have had 50
million men to meet the challenge of Bismarck’s Germany.</p>

<li>THE TEACHERS</li>
</ol>
<p>We have observed Napoleon, during his Consulate, trying to give a new
order and stability to postrevolutionary France by a Code of Civil Law,
and a Concordat of peace and cooperation between his government and the
traditional religion of the people. To these formative forces he
proposed to add a third by reorganizing the educational system of
France. “Of all social engines, the school is probably the most
efficacious, for it exercises three kinds of influence on the young
lives it enfolds and directs: one through the master, another through
con-discipleship, and the last through rules and regulations.” 22 He was
convinced that one reason for the breakdown of law and order during the
1 Revolution was its inability to establish, amid the life- and-death
conflicts of the time, a system of education adequately replacing that
which the Church had previously maintained. Splendid plans had been
formulated, but neither money nor time could be spared to realize them;
primary education had been left to priests and nuns, or to lay
schoolmasters maintained just above starvation by parents or communes;
secondary educa- tion had barely survived in lycees dispensing courses
in science and history, with scant attention to the formation of
character. Napoleon thought of public education in political terms: its
function was to produce intelligent but obedient citizens. “In
establishing a corps of teachers,” he said, with a candor unusual in
governments, “my principal aim is to secure the means for directing
political and moral opinions…. So long as one grows up without knowing
whether to be republican or monarchist, Catholic or irreligious, the
state will never form a nation; it will rest on ’ vague and uncertain
foun- dations; it will be constantly exposed to disorder and change.”
23</p>
<p>Having restored the Church to association with the government, he al-
lowed semimonastic’ organizations, like the Freres des Ecoles
Chretiennes,</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>o attend to primary instruction, and nuns to teach well-to-do girls;
but he refused to let the Jesuits reenter France. Nevertheless, he
admired them for their strict organization as a dedicated guild of
teachers. “The essential thing,” he wrote (February 16, 1805), “is a
teaching body like that of the Jesuits of old.” 24 “While I was with
him,” Bourrienne recalled, “he often told me that it was necessary that
all schools, colleges, and other establish- ments for public instruction
be subject to military discipline.” 25 In a note of 1805 Napoleon
proposed that “a teaching order could be formed if all the managers,
directors, and professors in the Empire were under one or more chiefs,
like the generals, provincials, etc., of the Jesuits,” and if it were
the</p>
<p>A year later (May 10, 1806) Antoine-Frangois de Fourcroy,
director</p>
<p>general of public instruction, secured from the Corps Legislatif a
provisional decree that “there shall be established, under the name of
the Imperial Uni - versity, a body exclusively charged with the work of
teaching throughout the Empire.” (The University of Paris, founded c. 1
150, had been suppressed by the Revolution in 1790.) This new university
was to be not merely a union of various faculties — theology, law,
medicine, science, and literature; it was to be the sole producer of
teachers for the secondary schools of France, and was to include all its
living and teaching graduates. These “lycees” were to be established in
one or more cities of each departement, with a curricu- lum combining
the classic languages and literatures with tbe sciences; they were to be
financed by the municipality, but all their teachers were to be
graduates of the university; and no one was to be promoted to a higher
post unless he had previously held those below it, 27 and had obeyed his
superiors like a soldier obeying an officer. To persuade French youths
to enter this treadmill, Napoleon provided 6,400 scholarships, whose
recipients pledged themselves to the teaching profession and promised to
defer marriage at least to the age of twenty- five. As their final
reward they were to “have clearly before them the prospect of rising to
the highest offices of the state.” 28 “All this,” Napoleon told
Fourcroy, “is only a commencement; by and by we shall do more, and be
tter.” 29</p>
<p>He did better, from his point of view, by restoring (1810), as a
branch of the university, the Ecole Normale, where select students,
living in common under military discipline, were given special training
by a prestigious faculty including such masters as Laplace, Lagrange,
Berthollet, and Monge. By 1813 all college teachers were expected to be
graduates of the ficole Nor- male; science began to prevail over the
classics in the college curriculum, and set the intellectual tone of
educated France. The F.cole Polytechnique, es- tablished during the
Revolution, was changed into a.; military academy, where the physical
sciences became the servants of war. Several provincial universities
survived the Emperor’s martial sweep, and private colle ges were allowed
to operate under license and periodical examination by the univer-</p>

<p>XXsity. As the authoritarian mood relaxed, individual lecturers were
permitted to use university halls to give special courses, and students
were allowed to take these as they chose.</p>
<p>At the top of the intellectual pyramid was the Institut National de
France. The French Academy, suppressed in 1793, had been restored in
1795 as Class II of the new Institute. Napoleon was proud of his
membership in the Institute, but when its moral and political section,
in 1801, presumed to dis- course on how a government should be run, he
ordered Comte Louis-Philippe de Segur to “tell the Secon d Class of the
Institute that I will have no political subjects treated at its
meetings.” 30 The Institute then contained many old rebels faithful to
the Enlightenment and the Revolution, who privately laughed or wept at
the official restoration of the Catholic Church. Cabanis and Destutt de
Tracy had used the word ideology as the study of the forma- tion of
ideas; Napoleon called these psychologists and philosophers “ideo -
logues” as men too immersed in ideas, and reveling in reason, to
perceive and</p>
<p>On January 23, 1803, he reorganized the Institute into four classes,
omit- ting the moral and political category. Class I, which he valued
most, was to study the sciences. Among its sixty members were Adrien
Legendre, Monge, Biot, Berthollet, Gay-Lussac, Laplace, Lamarck,
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and Cuvier. Class II had forty members, devoted
to the language and litera- ture of France; it replaced the old French
Academy, and resumed work on the Dictionnaire; it included the old poet
Delille, the famous dramatist Marie-Joseph de Chenier, the young
historian Guizot, the Romantic stylist Chateaubriand, the philosophers
Volney, Destutt de Tracy, and Maine de Biran. Class III, with forty
members, dealt with ancient and Oriental history, literature, and art;
here Louis Langles pursued those studies of Persia and India that had
already led to the Lcole des Langues Orientales (1795); and Jean-
Baptiste d’Ansse de Villoison discovered the Alexandrian
commentators</p>
<p>Aside from his distaste for ideologues, Napoleon supported the
Institute heartily, eager to make it an embellishment of his reign.
Every member of the Institute received from the government an annual
salary of fifteen hun- dred francs; each permanent secretary of a class
received six thousand. In February and March each class presented to the

<p>work done in its department. Napoleon was pleased with the total
picture, for (Meneval claimed) “this general review of literature,
science, and art… showed that human intelligence, far from going back,
did not halt in its constant march tow ard progress.” 33 We may question
the “constant,” but there is no doubt that the reorganization of science
and scholarship under Napoleon placed their practitioners at the head of
the European intellect for half a century.</p>

<li>THE WARRIORS</li>
</ol>
<p>After education, conscription. War had been made more frequent, more
homicidal, and more costly by the Revolution: the levy en masse in 1793
established the rule that war should be no longer the sport of princes
using mercenaries, but a struggle of nations involving every class —
though it was some time before the other governments followed the French
in allowing commoners to become officers, even marshals. Rousseau had
already laid down the principle that universal service was a logical
corollary of universal suffrage: he who would vote should serve. Facing
the European monarchies in a struggle to preserve its republic, France,
which, before Louis XIV, had been a medley of proud regions with no
national spirit binding the whole, was united in 1793 by a common fear.
Its response was national and decisive. A large army, calling all men,
became necessary; conscription began; and when masses of Frenchmen,
inspired as armies had rarely been before, began to defeat the
professional soldiers of the feudal monarchies, these countries too
enforced conscription, and war became a conflict of masses competing in
massacre. The glory of nationalism replaced the pride of dynasties as
the tonic of war.</p>
<p>In 1803, faced with the rupture of the Peace of Amiens, and
anticipating war with another coalition, Napoleon issued a new law of
conscription: all males between twenty and twenty-five years of age were
made subject to the draft. Many were exempted: young married men,
seminarians, widowers or divorces with children, anyone who had a
brother already taken, and the eldest of three orphans. Moreover, a
draftee could pay a substitute to take his place. At first this seemed
to Napoleon to be unjust; then he allowed it, chiefly on the ground that
advanced students should be left to continue their studies to fit
themselves for administrative posts. 34</p>
<p>This annual insistence that it is dulce et decorum pro patria utori
was borne patiently by the French people in t he ecstasy of Napoleon’s
victories; but when defeats began (1808), and left thousands of families
grieving, re- sistance grew, evaders and deserters multiplied. By 1814
Napoleon had recruited 2,613,000 Frenchmen for his armies; 35
approximately a million of these died of wounds or disease; 36 add half
a million enlisted or conscripted from foreign countries allied or
subject to France. In 1809 Napoleon asked Czar Alexander to mediate
between France and England, saying that a gen- eral peace would allow an
end to conscription; that hope passed. As defeated</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>enemies seemed to rise from their graves for new coalitions and
campaigns, Napoleon kept many conscripts beyond their statutory
five-year terms, and called up annual classes before their time, until
in 1813 he summoned the class of 1815. 37 At last the patience of French
parents gave way, and the cry of “Down with conscription!” rose
everywhere in France.</p>
<p>By such methods grew the Grande Armee, which was Napoleon’s love and
pride. He fostered its spirit by giving each regiment its own colorful
standard, which some brave youth would carry into the battle to lead and
inspire its men; if he fell, another youth would rush up, pick up the
flag, and carry it on. Usually this banner became the visible soul of
the regiment; almost always it survived to display its remnants in
victory parades, and at last to hang as a tattered but sacred trophy in
the church of the Invalides. Nearly every regiment had its distinctive
uniform and name, once famous from Brest to Nice, from Antwerp to
Bordeaux: Grenadiers, Hussars, Chas- seurs, Lancers, Dragoons… Above all
there were the 92,000 men who formed the Imperial Guard, kept in
protective reserve around the Emperor until some crisis called for their
lives. Any conscript could rise to member- ship in the Guard, and even
to wield a baton as one of the eighteen marshals of Napoleonic
France.</p>
<p>The results of the wars were endless — biological, economic,
political, and moral. The old figure of 1,700,000 Frenchmen dead in
those campaigns 38 has been reduced by later calculations to a million
men; 39 even so these pre- sumably premature deaths may have weakened
France for a generation, un- til her wombs made up the loss.
Economically the wars, and the stimulus of blockaded ports and military
needs, accelerated the growth of industry. Politically they strengthened
the unification of regional governments and loyalties under a central
rule. Morally the constant conflicts habituated Eu- rope to the
enlargement of wars, and to a code of slaughter unknown since the
barbarian invasions. At the fronts, and then in the capitals, the rulers
laid aside the Ten Commandments. “War justifies everything,” Napoleon
wrote to General Berthier in 1809; 40 “nothing has ever been established
except by the sword”; 41 and “in the last analysis there must be a
military quality in government”; 42 without an army t here is no
state.</p>
<p>To accustom the French people to this martial ethic Napoleon appealed
to their love of glory. La gloire became a national fever generating
enthusiastic concord and obedience; so Napoleon could say that “the wars
of the Revo - lution h ave ennobled the entire French nation.” 43 For
ten years, with the help of the Allies, he kept his people in this
hypnotic trance. Let Alfred de Musset, who was there, describe the mood
of France in 1 8 10:</p>
<p>It was in this air of the spotless sky, where shone so much glory,
where glistened so many swords, that the youth of the time breathed.
They well knew that they were destined to the hecatomb, but they
regarded Murat as invincible, and the Emperor had been seen to cross a
bridge where so many bullets whistled that they wondered was he immune
to death. And even if one must die, what did it matter? Death itself was
so beautiful, so noble, so illustrious, in his battle-scarred purple! It
borrowed the color of hope; it reaped</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>so many ripening harvests, that it became young, and there was no
more old age. All the cradles of France, as well as its tombs, were
armed with shield and buckler; there were no more old men; there were
corpses or demi-gods. 44</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the front, Napoleon’s soldiers stole and gambled, and
drank their fears to sleep; his generals stole according to their
station; Massena amassed millions, and Soult was not far behind. Amiable
Josephine, kindly Joseph, brave Lucien, and uncle Cardinal Fesch
profited by investing in firms that were selling shoddy goods to French
troops. Napoleon colored his war bulletins with exaggeration and
concealment, bled the treasuries of de- feated nations, appropriated
their art, and pondered ways to effect the moral regeneration of
France.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MORALS AND MANNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Revolution, by breaking down political and parental authority,
and dismissing religious belief, had let loose the individualistic
instincts of the French people — moderately in the provinces,
catastrophically in the capital; the center of law found itself
struggling within the center of chaos and crime. Napoleon, himself
lawless, determined to restore stability to morals and manners as vital
to the regeneration of France, the sanity and content- ment of its
people, and the success of his rule. He made it clear that he would keep
a stern eye on all business relations in or with the government, and
would punish severely all detected dishonesty. He set his face against
immodest dress in society or on the stage; he reprimanded his brother
Lucien and his sister Elisa for displaying too much of their flesh in
private theatri- cals; and when, at a soiree, he found himself
confronted by Mme. de Stael in low and ample decollete, he remarked
pointedly, “I presume that you nurse your children yourself ?” 45 He
insisted that Talleyrand marry his mis - tress. Mme. Tallien, who had
directed Directory morals by the curve of her hips, disappeared into the
provinces; Josephine said goodbye to adultery, and her frightened
milliners cut their bills in half. The new Code gave the husband almost
Roman powers over his wife and children; the family re- sumed its
function of turning animals into citizens, at whatever cost to per-
sonal freedom.</p>
<p>The mood of the age suffered some darkening as part price of the new
discipline. The reckless gaiety of the sexes and the classes under the
Revolu- tion yielded to bourgeois propriety and proletarian fatigue. The
class bar- riers that had graded and steadied the population in Bourbon
days gave way to a restless fever of competition as “career open to
talents” built stairs be - tween all tiers , 46 and set rootless youths
climbing the slippery pyramids to power. Such deductions made, Napoleon
was justified in feeling that under his rule morality returned to
France, and manners regained some of the cour- tesy that had eased and
graced prerevolutionary life in literate France.</p>
<p>He felt that despite all efforts to equalize opportunity some form of
class distinction would inevitably develop from the natural diversity of
abilities</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>and environments. To keep this result from being merely an
aristocracy of wealth, he established in 1 802 the Legion of Honor, to
be composed of men, chosen by the government, who had distinguished
themselves by special excellence in their fields — war, law, religion,
science, scholarship, art… It was to be half as democratic as life: all
men were eligible, but no women. The members swore, on admission, to
support the principles of liberty and equality; but they were soon
graded into classes according to their merit or influence or tenure.
Each received from the French government an annual stipend: 5,000 francs
for a “grand officer,” 2,000 to a “commander,” 1,000 to an “officer,”
250 to a “chevalier.” 47 To distinguish them, the members were to wear a
ribbon or a cross. When some councilors smiled at such “baubles,”
Napoleon replied that men are more easily led by decorations than by au-
thority or force; “one obtains everything from men by appealing to their
sense of honor.” 48</p>
<p>The Emperor took another step toward a new aristocracy by creating
(1807) the “Imperial Nobility,” conferring titles upon his relatives,
his mar - shals, certain administrative officers, and outstanding
savants; so, in the next seven years, he made 31 dukes, 452 counts,
1,500 barons, 1,474 chevaliers. Talleyrand became prince of Benevent o,
Fouche became Due d’Otrante (Otranto); Joseph Bonaparte was suddenly
grand elector, Louis Bonaparte was grand constable; Murat, cavalry
leader, was surprised to find himself grand admiral; Marshal Davout was
christened Due d’Auerstedt; Lannes, Due de Montebello; Savary, Due de
Rovigo; Lefebvre, Due de Dantzig. Laplace and Volney became counts, and
Napoleon’s sisters blossomed into princesses. With each title went a
colorful and distinctive uniform, an an- nual revenue, sometimes a
substantial estate. Moreover — and here Napoleon frankly turned his back
upon the republic — most of these titles were made hereditary. Only with
transmissible property, in Napoleon’s view, could his new aristocrats
maintain their position and authority, and thereby serve as a support to
the ruler. The Emperor himself, to keep a step or two ahead of the new
aristocracy — which soon flaunted its titles, uniforms, and powers —
guarded himself with chamberlains, equerries, prefects of the palace,
and a hundred other servitors; and Josephine was equipped with
ladies-in-waiting whose titles came from the Bourbons or beyond.</p>
<p>Still unsated, he turned to the survivors of the old nobility, and
used every lure to draw them to his court. He had called many of them
back to France as a foil to the still revolutionary Jacobins, and in the
hope of establishing continuity between the old France and the new. This
seemed impossible, for the returning emigres scorned Napoleon as a
parvenu usurper, denounced his policies, satirized his manners, looks,
and speech, and made fun of his new aristocracy. Gradually, however, as
his prestige mounted with his vic- tories, and as France rose to such
power and wealth as not even Louis XIV had won for her, this lofty
attitude bent: the younger sons of the emigres gladly accepted
appointments in the Upstart’s service; 49 grandes dames came to attend
Josephine; and at last some nobles of ancient vintage — Montmor- encys,
Montesquious, Segurs, Gramonts, Noailles, Turennes — added their</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>2?I</p>
<p>aura to the imperial court, and were rewarded with partial
restoration of their confiscated estates. After the marriage with Marie
Louise the reconcili- ation seemed complete. But much of it was
superficial; the newer sons and daughters of the Revolution did not
relish the superior manners and prestige of the pedigreed; the Army,
still fond of its revolutionary ideals, grumbled to see its idol
exchanging bows with ancient foes; these looked down upon the tall
generals, the nervous savants, and the ambitious Bonapartes, who had
presumed to replace them.</p>
<p>To keep this den of lions from open war with words or swords,
Napoleon insisted upon a code of etiquette. He commissioned some
specialists to draw up, from the best Bourbon models, a manual of
manners designed to meet every situation courteously; they did, to a
bulk of eight hundred pages ; 60 philosophers and grenadiers studied it;
and the imperial court became a model of brilliant dress and empty
speech. The courtiers played cards, but, as Napoleon forbade playing for
money, the cards lost their value. Plays were performed, concerts were
given, there were stately ceremonies and massive balls. When the
excitement of comparing costumes and matching wit declined, the more
intimate members of the court moved with Emperor and Empress to
St.-Cloud, or Rambouillet, or Trianon, or, most happily, to
Fontainebleau, where formality loosened its stays, and hunting warmed
the blood.</p>
<p>No one was so irked by this regal ritual as Napoleon, and he avoided
it as much as he could. “Etiquette,” he said, “is the prison of kings.”
51 And to Las Cases: “Necessity compelled me to observe a degree of
state, to adopt a certain system of solemnity — in a word, to establish
etiquette. Otherwise I should have been every day liable to be slapped
on the shoulder.” 52 As for ceremonies, they too had their rationale. “A
newly established govern ment must dazzle and astonish. The moment it
ceases to glitter it falls.” 53 “Dis - play is to power what ceremony is
to religion.” 54 “Is it not a fact that the Catholic religion appeals
more strongly to the imagination by the pomp of its ceremonies than by
the sublimity of its doctrines? When you want to arouse enthusiasm in
the masses you must appeal to their eyes.” 55 As usual in history, the
manners of the court passed down, tapering, to the literate population.
“It took only ten or twelve years,” said the learned “Bibliophile Jacob”
(Paul Lacroix) “to make of the grand monde of the Directory a decent,
polished, and well-brought- up society.” 56 This was espe - cially true
of Lyons and Bordeaux, not to speak of Paris where, said Mme. de Stael,
“so many persons of intellect came together,… and so many were</p>
<p>2 7 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>over the tastes and purses of the French people. It was during the
Consulate and the Empire that Anthelme Brillat-Savarin accumulated the
facts and legends that swelled his classic of gastronomy, La Physiologie
du gout, which reached print only a year (1826) before his death.</p>
<p>Styles of speech and dress were changing. Citoyen and Citoyenne were
being replaced by the prerevolutionary Monsieur and Madame. Men of
fashion reverted to knee breeches and silk stockings, but pantaloons
regained supremacy as the Empire waned. The ladies, abandoning the style
grecque of the Directory, returned to skirts and bodices. Decollete
remained gener- ous, with bare shoulders and arms; Napoleon opposed the
fashion, Josephine approved of it; her pretty arms and shoulders and
buttressed bosom won. 59</p>
<p>The Emperor gave his approval to masked balls, for he was glad to see
social life revive. He did not care for the salons that were flourishing
in Paris. They were becoming a refuge of politicians, authors, and
“ideologues” critical of his increasingly dictatorial regime. His
brothers Joseph and Lucien organized frequent receptions where the talk
was necessarily favorable to the Emperor and generally hostile to
Josephine; Fouche and Talleyrand held their own courts, where criticism
was polite; the returned emigres excoriated all the Bonapartes in somber
soirees in the Faubourg St.-Germain; and Mme. de Stael maintained her
famous salon as part of herfifteen years’ war against Napoleon. Mme. de
Genlis, returning to France after seven years as an emigree, devoted her
salon and her writings to defending the Emperor against Bourbons,
Jacobins, Mme. de Stael, and Mine. Recamier.</p>
<p>V. MME. RECAMIER</p>
<p>La Recamier’s salon owed its success to her enticing beauty and her.
hus - band’s complaisant wealth. Bom in Lyons in 1777, named J eanne -F
ranqoise- Julie-Adelai’de Bernard, and known to her friends as Julie or
Juliette, she was endowed with a loveliness of face and figure that
survived even when she had become seventy and blind. She developed
almost every charm of the feminine character — kindness, sympathy,
tenderness, taste, grace, tact… She added to this a sensuous pliancy
that stirred a hundred males without any known harm to her virginity. In
1793, aged sixteen, she married Jacques- Rose Recamier, who was
forty-two but a banker. He was so pleased to con- template her beauty,
to hear her singing, to watch her delicate hands draw- ing sentiment
from her piano or her harp, that he cushioned her in every comfort;
financed her career as a salonniere, bore with paternal indulgence the
conquests that she made, herself unconquered, and apparently did not
insist on his marital rights. 60</p>
<p>In 1798 he bought the Parisian home of Jacques Necker, on the Rue du
Mont-Blanc. During that transaction Juliette, twenty-one, met Mme. de
Stael, thirty-two; it was only a casual encounter, but it began a
lifelong friendship that even rivalry in love could not end. Inspired by
the success with which the older woman had brought to her salon the most
prominent</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>2 73</p>
<p>statesmen and authors of the time, Juliette in 1799 opened her new
home to periodical gatherings of men and women prominent in the
political, cultural, or social life of Paris. Lucien Bonaparte, the
minister of the interior, lost little time in declaring to her his
imperishable love. She showed his flaming letters to her husband, who
advised her to treat Lucien with patience lest the Recamier bank incur
the hostility of the rising dynasty. Napoleon extin- guished Lucien’s
fire by sending him as ambassador to Spain. Perhaps he him - self had
cast an eye upon Juliette as a “morsel for a king.” 61 She had quite
other inclinations. Despite her husband’s cautions, and her father’s
precarious position as postmaster general in the consular government,
she welcomed to her salon royalists like Mathieu de Montmorency,
anti-Napoleon generals like Bernadotte and Moreau, and others who
resented the First Consul’s in - creasingly imperial ways.</p>
<p>She was now in the prime of her beauty, and the leading painters were
glad, to have her sit for them. David portrayed her in the favorite pose
of current goddesses — reclining on a couch, and loosely dressed in a
Grecian gown that left bare her arms and feet. M. Recamier felt that
David had not caught the demure loveliness of his wife; he challenged
Francois Gerard, David’s pupil, to rival hi s master; Gerard succeeded
so well that David never forgave him. 62</p>
<p>In 1802 Juliette and her mother visited England, where dignitaries
like the Prince of Wales and belles like the Duchess of Devonshire
received her with all the honors due to her beauty and her
anti-Bonapartist sentiments. Soon after her return to France her father
was arrested for having connived at secret negotiations between Parisian
royalists and the rebel Chouans of the Vendee; he was arrested, and was
in danger of being sentenced to death, when his distracted daughter
persuaded Bernadotte to go to Napoleon and intercede for M. Bernard’s
release. Napoleon consented, but dismissed him from his post. “The
government,” Juliette admitted, “had a perfect right to remove him.”
63</p>
<p>In 1806 her husband appealed to the Bank of France to save him from
bankruptcy by lending him a million francs. The directors referred the
re- quest to Napoleon, who, returning from Marengo, found the bank
itself in- volved in difficulties; he forbade the loan. Recamier sold
the house on the Rue du Mont-Blanc; Juliette sold her silver and
jewelry, and, without com- plaint, accepted a simpler life. But she came
close to a breakdown when, on January 20, 1807, her mother died. Hearing
of this, Mme. de Stael invited her; to come for a stay in the Necker
chateau at Coppet in Switzerland. M. Recamier, absorbed in a struggle to
regain solvency, gave her his per- mission to go. On July 10 she reached
Coppet, and began the most amorous period of her career.</p>
<p>A succession of suitors attended upon her there, including Mme. de
Stael’s lover Benjamin Constant. She enjoyed and encouraged their
attentions, all the while (we are told) guarding her citadel. Some
critics have accused her of dealing recklessly with men’s hearts, and
Constant wrote bitterly: “She has played with my happiness, my life; may
she be cursed!” 64 But Constant</p>
<p>274 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XI</p>
<p>oo played with hearts and lives, and the Duchesse d’Abrantes
remembered</p>
<p>One cannot expect to find, in future times, a woman like her — a
woman whose friendship has been courted by the most remarkable persons
of the age; a woman whose beauty has thrown at her feet all the men who
have once set eyes upon her; whose love has been the object of universal
desire, yet whose virtue has remained pure…. In her days of gaiety and
splendor she had the merit of being always ready to sacrifice her own
enjoyments to afford consola- tion… to any friend in affliction. To the
world Mme. Recamier is a cele- brated woman; to those who had the
happiness to know and appreciate her she was a peculiar and gifted
being, formed by Nature as a perfect model in one of her most beneficent
moods. 65</p>
<p>In October, 1807, Juliette came so close to commitment with Prince
Au- gust of Prussia, nephew of Frederick the Great, that she wrote to
her hus- band asking for release from their marriage. Recamier reminded
her that he had through fourteen years shared his wealth with her, and
had indulged her every wish; did it not seem wrong of her to desert him
in his efforts for financial recovery? She returned to Paris and her
husband, and the Prince had to comfort himself with her letters.</p>
<p>As Recamier grew rich again, and Juliette inherited a fortune from
her mother, she resumed her salon, and her opposition to Napoleon. In 18
11, when Mme. de Stael was in hot disfavor with the Emperor, and Mathieu
de Montmorency had just been exiled for visiting her, Juliette dared
fortune, and, over the warnings of Germaine, insisted on spending at
least a day with her at Coppet. Napoleon, upset by bad news from Spain
and Russia, forbade her to come within 120 miles of Paris. After his
first abdication (April 11,</p>
<ol start="1814" type="1">
<li>she returned, reopened her salon, and entertained Wellington and
other leaders of the victorious Allies. When Napoleon returned from Elba
and recaptured France without a blow, she prepared to leave the capital,
but Hortense promised to protect her, and she remained, temporarily
subdued. After the second abdication (June 22, 1815) she resumed her
hospitality. Chateaubriand, whom she had met in 1801, now reentered her
life, and gave her a second youth in a strange and historic
romance.</li>

<li>THE JEWS IN FRANCE</li>
</ol>
<p>The emancipation of the European Jews came first in France because
France led in the emancipation of the mind, and because the
Enlightenment had accustomed a rising proportion of adults to interpret
history in secular terms. Biblical research had revealed Jesus as a
lovable preacher critical of Pharisees but loyal to Judaism; and the
Gospels themselves had shown him as gladly heard by thousands of Jews,
and welcomed by thousands as he entered Jerusalem. How, then, could an
entire people, through thousands of years, be punished for the crime of
a high priest, and a handful of incidental rabble, demanding his death?
Economic hostilities remained, and fed the</p>
<p>CHAP. Xl)</p>
<p>NAPOLEONIC FRANCE</p>
<p>2 75</p>
<p>natural unease in the presence of strange speech and garb; but even
that ani- mosity was declining, and Louis XVI had encountered no popular
resistance to his removal of taxes that had specifically burdened the
Jews. Mirabeau, in an essay that barbed logic with wit, had pleaded for
the complete emancipa- tion of the Jews (1787), and the Abbe Gregoire
had won a prize from the Royal Society of Science and Arts in Metz, in
1789, for his treatise The Physical, Moral, and Political Regeneration
of the Jews. It seemed only a logical consequence of the Declaration of
Human Rights when the Constitu- ent Assembly, on September 27, 1791,
extended full civil rights to all the Jews of France. The armies of the
Revolution carried political freedom to the Jews of Holland in 1796, of
Venice in 1797, of Mainz in 1798; and soon the Code Napoleon established
it automatically wherever Bonaparte’s con - quests reached.</p>
<p>Napoleon himself came to the problem with the soldier’s customary
scorn of tradesmen. Stopping at Strasbourg in January, 1806, on his
return from the Austerlitz campaign, he received appeals to help the
peasants of Alsace from their financial misery. Suddenly released from
feudal servitude, they had found themselves without employment or land
to give them a living. They had asked local bankers — mostly German Jews
— to lend them the sub- stantial sums they needed to buy acres, tools,
and seed to set themselves up as peasant proprietors. The bankers
provided the funds, but at rates reaching sixteen percent interest,
which, to the lenders, seemed justified by the risks involved.
(Borrowers in America today pay similar rates.) Now some of the farmers
could not meet their payments of interest and amortization. Napo- leon
was informed that unless he interfered many peasants would face the loss
of their lands; he was warned that all Christian Alsace was up in arms
over the situation, and that an attack upon the Jews was imminent.
Arrived in Paris, he took up the matter with his Council. Some members
advised harsh measures; others pointed out that the Jews of Marseilles,
Bor- deaux, Milan, and Amsterdam were living in peace and respect in
their com- munities, and should not be penalized by any general
revocation of the rights held by Jews in regions controlled by France.
Napoleon compromised: he ruled that the claims of Jewish creditors in
certain provinces should not be collected until a year had passed. 66
But at the same time (May 30, 1806) he invited Jewish notables from
throughout France to meet in Paris to consider the problems affecting
the relations of Christians and Jews, and to suggest means of spreading
the Jews more widely throughout France, and into a greater variety of
occupations. The prefects of the departments were to choose the
notables, but “on the whole their selection was fortunate.” 67</p>
<p>The rabbis and laymen most respected by their congregations gathered
in Paris in July, 1806, in number hi, and were given a hall in the Hotel
de Ville for their deliberations. Napoleon, or his councilors, submitted
to the meeting some questions on which the Emperor solicited
information: Are Jews polygamous? Do they allow the marriage of Jews
with Christians? Do the rabbis claim the right to grant divorces
independently of the civil au- thorities? Do the Jews consider usury
lawful? The notables formulated an-</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XI</p>
<p>swers calculated to please Napoleon: polygamy was forbidden in the
Jewish communities, and divorce was allowed only when confirmed by the
civil courts; intermarriage with Christians was permitted; usury was
contrary to Mosaic law. 08 Napoleon sent Count Louis Mole to express his
satisfaction; and the Count, formerly critical, addressed the notables
with spontaneous eloquence: “Who would not be astonished at the sight of
this assembly of enlightened men, selected from among the descendants of
the most ancient of nations? If an individual of past centuries could
come to life, and if this scene met his gaze, would he not think himself
transplanted within the walls of the Holy City?” 09 However, he added,
the Emperor desired a religious sanction and surety to be given for the
principles affirmed by this predomi- nantly lay assembly, and proposed
that the notables should call to Paris, for this and other purposes, the
“Great Sanhedrin”— Israel’s supreme rabbinical court — which, because of
the dispersion of the Jews after the destruction of the Jerusalem
Temple, had not met since a.d. 66. The notables were happy to cooperate.
On October 6 they sent to all the leading synagogues of Eu- rope the
Emperor’s invitation to elect delegates to the great “sitting to -
gether” ( Sanhedrin was from the Greek synedrion ) to consider means of
mitigating the difficulties between Christians and Jews, and to
facilitate the entry of French Jews into all the rights and advantages
of French civiliza- tion. The notables accompanied their invitation with
a proud and happy proclamation:</p>
<p>A great event is about to take place, one which, through a long
series of cen- turies our fathers, and even we in our own times, did not
expect to see. The 20th of October has been fixed as the date for the
opening of a Great San- hedrin in the capital of one of the most
powerful Christian nations, and under the protection of the immortal
prince who rules over it. Paris will show the world a remarkable scene,
and this ever memorable event will open to the dis- persed remnants of
the descendants of Abraham a period of deliverance and prosperity.
70</p>
<p>The Great Sanhedrin could not live up to these enthusiastic
expectations. Eight days after the invitations went out Napoleon and his
troops fought the Prussians at Jena. All through that fall he remained
in Germany or Poland, dismembering Prussia, creating the grand duchy of
Warsaw, playing politics or war; all through the winter he remained in
Poland, reorganizing his army, fighting the Russians to a draw at Eylau,
overwhelming them at Friedland, and making peace with Czar Alexander at
Tilsit (1807). He had little time left for the Great Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>It met on February 9, 1807. Forty-five rabbis and twenty-six laymen
con- ferred, listened to speeches, and ratified the replies given to
Napoleon by the notables. They proceeded later to issue recommendations
to the Jews: to end any animosity to Christians, to love their country
as now their own, to ac- cept military service in its defense, to avoid
usury, and to enter more and more into agriculture, handicrafts, and the
arts. In March the Sanhedrin sent its report to the distant Napoleon,
and adjourned.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, on March 18, 1808, Napoleon issued his final

<p>sions. They ratified the religious freedom of the Jews, and their
full political rights in all of France except Alsace and Lorraine;
there, for the next ten years, certain restrictions were imposed upon
bankers to lessen bankruptcies and racial animosities; the debts of
women, minors, and soldiers were can- celed; the courts were authorized
to cancel or reduce arrears in payment of interest, and to grant a
moratorium for payment; no Jew was to engage in trade without a license
from the prefect; and further immigration of Jews into Alsace was
forbidden. 71 In 1810 the Emperor added another request: that every Jew
should take a family name — which he hoped would facilitate ethnic
assimilation.</p>
<p>It was an imperfect settlement, but perhaps some allowance must be
made for a ruler who insisted on ruling everything, and therefore found
himself repeatedly inundated with problems and details. The Jews of
Alsace felt unjustly injured by the Emperor’s regulations; but most
Jewish communi - ties in France and elsewhere accepted them as a
reasonable attempt to ease an explosive situation. 72 Meanwhile, in the
constitution that he drew up for Westphalia, Napoleon declared that all
the Jews of that new kingdom were to enjoy all the rights of citizenship
on a complete level with other citizens. 73 In France the crisis passed,
and the Jews entered fruitfully and creatively into French literature,
science, philosophy, music, and art.</p>
