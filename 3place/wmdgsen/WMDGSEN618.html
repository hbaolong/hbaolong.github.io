Neighbors</h4>
<p>1789-1815</p>
<p>I. THE SCOTS</p>
<p>T HEY had been under British rule since the Union of 1707, enjoying
freedom of movement and trade within the island, but never reconciled to
government by a distant Parliament in whose House of Commons Scot-
land’s 1,800,000 souls were represented by forty -five delegates against
the 513 representing the 10,164,000 population of England and Wales. Of
the Scottish members, fifteen were appointed by self-perpetuating and
corrupt town councils whose members were chosen by a total of 1,220
electors in all the boroughs. The remaining thirty were elected by the
rural counties on a franchise limited to influential landholders; so the
county of Bute, with 14,000 inhabitants, had twenty-one voters, and all
the counties together had 2,40s. 1 Most of the successful candidates had
been selected by the great nobles of the old and spacious estates.
Feudalism had been abolished through- out Scotland in 1748, but poverty
remained, since greed and inequality are in the structure of man. By and
large, Scotland, like England, accepted this form of representative
government as the best that could be established among a people fondly
tied to tradition, and too harassed by daily needs to acquire the
knowledge and experience needed for voting intelligently on national
issues.</p>
<p>Religion was stronger than the state. The Sabbath was a day of somber
worship and remembrance of sin; the clergy preached Adam’s fall, a per -
sonal Devil, and a vengeful God; and the congregations were more hard-
ened in doctrine and morals than their pastors. David Deans, in The
Heart of Midlothian, is sure that a girl who goes to a dance will go to
hell. 2</p>
<p>Nevertheless Scotland was in many ways ahead of England. She had a
national system of really public schools: every parish was required to
main- tain a school where boys and girls together were taught reading
and arith- metic. For this instruction the parents paid two shillings
per quarter-year per student; and for two shillings more the student
would get a touch of Latin. The children of paupers were paid for by the
parish, and when the parish was too widespread to gather its children
together, an itinerant schoolmaster brought some schooling to each
section in turn. The teachers were strictly subject to the parish
clergy, and were expected to help in transmitting a terrifying theology;
for the elders had found that Calvinism was an economical way of
installing a sheriff in every soul. A goodly num-</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>ber of undaunted spirits survived to produce the Scottish
Enlightenment in the generation before the French Revolution, and to
continue it, some- what subdued, in the age of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Scotland was proud of its universities, at St. Andrews (founded in
1410), Glasgow (1451), Aberdeen (1494), and Edinburgh (1583). These con-
sidered themselves superior in many respects to Oxford and Cambridge,
and some modern scholars admit the claim; 3 in medical instruction the
University of Edinburgh was the acknowledged leader. 4 Th e Edinburgh
Review, founded in 1802, was by common consent the most brilliant
periodical in Great Britain, and the brave liberal lawyer Thomas Erskine
(1750-1823) outshone nearly all other advocates before the London bar.
It must be acknowledged, however, that when it came to suppressing
freedom of thought — especially when this favored revolutionary France —
no English jurist could rival the Scotch. Otherwise the intellectual
climate in Edin- burgh and Glasgow continued to favor the freedom that
had protected David Hume, William Robertson, James Boswell, Robert
Burns, and Adam Smith. We are told that not only the students but the
entire intelligentsia of Edinburgh were to be seen taking notes at
Dugald Stewart’s lectures on philosophy.</p>
<p>Stewart is almost forgotten today outside Scotland; but one of the
state- liest monuments in Edinburgh is a small classic temple erected to
his mem- ory. He followed Thomas Reid in subjecting the skeptical
conclusions of Hume and the mechanistic psychology of David Hartley to
the scrutiny of “common sense.” 5 He rejected metaphysics as a vain
attempt of the mind to fathom the nature of the mind. (Only Baron
Munchausen could pull himself up by his bootstraps.) In place of
metaphysics Stewart proposed inductive psychology, which would practice
patient and precise observa- tion of mental processes without pretending
to explain mind itself. Stewart was a man of wit and style, who gave
acute accounts of wit, fancy dreams, and the poetic faculty. (His
country was still a fount of loving songs, and some of the tenderest
tunes that warmed our youth came from the banks and braes of
Scotland.)</p>
<p>James Mill — though he surfeited his son with education — was a man
of good will and spacious intellect. Son of a shoemaker, he won honors
in Greek at the University of Edinburgh. Having graduated, he moved to
London, lived dangerously by journalism, married, and begot a son whom
he named after his M.P. friend John Stuart. Between 1806 and 1818 he
wrote a History of British India which contained so convincingly docu-
mented a critique of misrule that it advanced major reforms in the
govern- ment of India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1808) he met Jeremy Bentham, and enthusiastically accepted
the utilitarian proposal that ethical and political customs and concepts
should be judged according to their ability to advance the happiness of
mankind. Overflowing with energy and ideas, Mill made himself the
apostle of Bentham to Britain. For the fourth (1810), fifth (1815), and
sixth (1820) editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (itself a Scottish
enterprise) he</p>
<p>504 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>wrote articles — on government, jurisprudence, prison reform,
education, and freedom of the press — which, republished, won wide
circulation and influ- ence. These essays, and his contributions to the
Westminster Review, be- came a force in the movement that led to the
Reform Act of 1832. Under such leadership the British radicals turned
from total revolution to progres- sive reform through a government based
on a widening franchise and a utilitarian philosophy. In Elements of
Political Economy (1821) Mill</p>
<p>warned against letting population grow faster than capital, and
proposed taxation of the “unearned increment”— the laborless rise in the
value of land. In an Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829)
he sought to explain all mental operations through the association of
ideas. And in 1835, a year before his death, he published a Fragment on
Mackintosh.</p>
<p>Sir James Mackintosh continued the Scottish education of England.
After acquiring the tools of thought at the universities of Aberdeen and
Edin- burgh, he migrated to London (1788). Soon he thrilled to the news
that a popular uprising had captured the Bastille; in 1790 he resented
Edmund Burke’s hostile Reflections on the French Revolution ; and in
1791 he an - swered that historic diatribe with Vindiciae Gallic ae, a
vindication of Gallic democracy. The twenty-six-year-old philosopher
saw, in the early stages of the cataclysm, the noble voice and fruit of
a humanitarian philosophy; whereas the threatened monarchies were not,
as Burke supposed, the tested wisdom of tradition and experience but the
chaotic residue of haphazard in- stitutions, unforeseen events, and
patchwork repairs.</p>
<p>All the governments that now exist in the world (except the United
States of America) have been fortuitously formed…. It was certainly not
to be pre- sumed that these fortuitous governments should have surpassed
the works of intellect…. It was time that men should learn to tolerate
nothing ancient that reason does not respect, and to shrink from no
novelty to which reason may conduct. It was time that the human powers…
should mark the commence- ment of a new era in history by giving birth
to the art of improving govern- ment, and increasing the civil happiness
of man. 6</p>
<p>As the Revolution declined from the ideals of philosophers to the
chaotic tyranny of terrified men, Mackintosh revised his theorems, and
adjusted himself to the social forces impinging upon him. His lectures
on “The Laws of Nature and of Nations” (1799) discoursed, in a way that
would have pleased Burke, on how social organization can generate — in
the individual’s development — habits of action and judgments of
conscience which acquire all the appearance of being innate; so the
adult, through civilization, is a product not of nature only but of
nurture as well. — In his final years Mack- intosh wrote, from original
researches and documents, a History of the Revolution in England
(1832).</p>
<p>We may judge from these instances that Scottish civilization was not
rest- ing on its past glories at the turn of the eighteenth into the
nineteenth cen- tury. Agriculture was prospering, especially in the
Lowlands. There, too, the textne mills were busy, and Robert Owen was
opening up new visions of human cooperation. Glasgow was proud of its
scientists, and Edinburgh</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>5«5</p>
<p>was throbbing with lawyers, doctors, and clergymen in the van of
their time. In art Sir Henry Raeburn was painting portraits that made
him the Reynolds of Scotland. In literature Boswell was publishing
(1791) that in- exhaustible fountain of delight, The Life of Samuel
Johnson; and at Abbots- ford on the Tweed, mediating between ancient
enemies, singing melodious lays, and writing world-famous novels to pay
debts only partly ms own, was the finest Scot and gentleman of them
all.</p>
<p>Walter Scott was by temperament well suited to be a leader in the Ro-
mantic flowering of British literature, for he liked to think of himself
as descended from the Scottish border chieftains whose feuds and wars
had provided stirring matter for the ballads that were fed him in his
childhood. His immediate ancestors, however, were an Edinburgh solicitor
and the daughter of a professor of medicine in the University of
Edinburgh. He was bom there in 1771, one of twelve children, six of
whom, after the cus- tom of that time, died in infancy. In his
eighteenth month he was stricken with poliomyelitis, which left him
permanently lame in his right leg. Byron’s kindred disability may have
helped Scott to maintain an undiscourageable friendship with the younger
poet through all divergences of morals and be- lief.</p>
<p>After attending Edinburgh’s Old College, Scott began a five -year ap-
prenticeship in law under his father, and in 1792 he was admitted as an
advo- cate to the Scottish bar. His marriage with Charlotte Charpentier
(1797) and a legacy from his father (1799) gave him a comfortable
income. He was sociable and likable, and won many influential friends,
through whom, in 1806, he was appointed clerk of session at Edinburgh.
The emoluments of office, and some bequests from relatives, allowed him
to neglect, and soon abandon, his law practice in order to indulge his
taste for literature.</p>
<p>A chance meeting with Robert Burns, a fondness for Thomas Percy’s
Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, and an acquaintance with the lyrics
— especially Lenore — oi Gottfried Burger, refreshed his adolescent
interest in old British ballads. In 1802-03 he brought out, in three
volumes, The Min- strelsy of the Scottish Border. Stimulated by these
lively tales, he tried his own hand at the form, and in 1805 he issued
The Lay of the Last Minstrel. Its sale was a landmark in the annals of
British poetry. When he went to London in 1807 he found himself the lord
of the salons. He decided to make literature his profession and almost
his business, and began a perilous invest- ment of his time and money in
composing, printing, and publishing.</p>
<p>In the rhymed octosyllabic couplets of Coleridge’s Christabel he
found an easy medium for his swiftly moving, romantic narratives of love
and war, of mystery and the supernatural, in Scottish legend and
history. He ex- ploited the new field with Marmion (1808), The Lady of
the Lake (1810), Rokeby (1813), and The Lord of the Isles (1815). He did
not claim to be a great poet; he wrote to entertain the public
profitably, not to entertain the Muses, who, after all, were weary of
epics and hexameters. His readers fol- lowed him breathlessly from
knight to fair lady to heroic fray; and they sang with zest such
interspersed songs as “O, young Lochinvar is come out</p>
<p>50 6 THEAGE0FNAP0LE0N (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>of the west, / Through all the wide Border his steed was the best.” 7
Then, in 1813, Byron issued The Giaour and The Bride of Abydos, and in
1814 The Corsair and Lara. Scott saw his audience leaving border for
Oriental mysteries and desperate misanthropes; he recognized that the
young lord of Newstead Abbey could outrhyme and outpace the laird of
Abbotsford; and in 1814, with Waver ley, he turned from poetry to prose,
and struck new ore.</p>
<p>It was most opportune. In 1802 he had advanced money to James Ballan-
tyne, a printer at Kelso, to move his press to Edinburgh; in 1805 he
became privately a partner in James and John Ballantyne’s printing and
publishing firm; and henceforth he arranged that his compositions, by
whomever pub- lished, should be printed at the Ballantyne press. With
his earnings and profits Scott bought in 18 n the estate of Abbotsford
(near Melrose), ex- panded its no acres to 1,200, and replaced the old
farmhouse with a cha- teau expensively furnished and beautifully
adorned; it is one of the show- places of Scotland. But in 1813 the
Ballantyne firm neared bankruptcy, partly due to publishing, at a loss,
various projects edited by Scott. He set himself to restore the
Ballantynes to solvency with loans from his rich friends and with the
proceeds from his writings. By 1817 the firm was solvent, and Scott was
immersed in one of the most famous series of novels in literary
history.</p>
<p>Waverley was published anonymously in 1814, and earned some two
thousand pounds — much of which was soon spent on Abbotsford. Scott con-
cealed his authorship, feeling it a bit unseemly for a clerk of sessions
to write fiction for sale. His pen moved almost as fast in prose as it
had done in verse. In six weeks he wrote Guy Mannering (1815); in 1816
The Antiquary; in 1816-19 (under the general title of Tales of My
Landlord) he presented an engaging panorama of Scottish scenes — Old
Mortality, The Heart of Mid- lothian, The Bride of Lammermo or, and The
Legend of Montrose; from one of these Donizetti made another fortune.
Scott traveled extensively through Scotland and England and the
neighboring islands; he called himself an anti- quary rather than a
novelist; and he was able to give his stories a local color and
dialectic tang that delighted his Scottish following. Ivanhoe, The Mon-
astery, and The Abbot — all in 1820 — took x medieval England as their
scene, not quite so realistically as the Scottish tales had done. In
1825 Scott ven- tured into the medieval East, and in The Talisman he
gave so flattering a picture of Saladin that pious Scots began to doubt
the thoroughness of the author’s orthodoxy. When George Eliot was asked
what first had shaken her Christian faith, she answered, “Walter Scott.”
8</p>
<p>Those of us who relished the “Waverley Novels” in youth are now too
fevered with our modern pace to enjoy them today; but even a hurried im-
mersion in one of them — say The Heart of Midlothian — renews our sense
that the man who could produce such a book every year for a decade must
have been one of the wonders of his time. We see him playing the feudal
baron at Abbotsford (he was knighted in 1820), yet meeting all men with
kindness and simplicity; the most famous author of the age — known from
Edinburgh to St. Petersburg (where Pushkin revered him), but
laughing</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>England’s neighbors</p>
<p>507</p>
<p>heartily on hearing himself compared to Shakespeare. His poems and
novels were potent factors in the Romantic movement, though he harbored
few romantic delusions. He shared in reviving interest in medieval ways;
never- theless he pleaded with the Scots to put aside their idealization
of their vio- lent feudal past, and to adjust themselves to that Union
which was slowly merging two peoples into one. In his old age he warmed
himself with a Tory patriotism that would admit no fault in the British
Constitution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his printers, the Ballantynes, and his publisher, Archibald
Constable, were both approaching bankruptcy. In 1826 they surrendered
their remaining assets to the court, and Sir Walter, as partner, became
liable for the Ballantynes’ debts. Now at last Europe learned that the
author of the Waverley Novels was the lord of Abbotsford. The court
allowed him to keep his home and some acres, and his official salary as
clerk of session, but all his other assets were forfeited. He could
still live comfortably, and he continued to pour forth novel after novel
in the hope that his earnings could annul his debts. In 1827 he sent
forth a laborious Life of Napoleon, which a wit called “a blasphemy in
ten volumes.” It denuded the Corsican of almost every virtue, but it
pleased the British soul, and moderately re- duced the author’s
debts.</p>
<p>The quality of his remaining product reflected his haste and unease.
In 1830-31 he suffered several strokes. He recovered, and the government
as- signed a frigate to take him for a cruise under the Mediterranean
sun; but new strokes disabled him, and he was hurried back so that he
might die in his beloved Abbotsford (1832). Another publisher, Robert
Cadell, took over his remaining debts ( £ 7,000) and copyrights, and
made a fortune out of the combination, for the novels of Walter Scott
remained popular till the end of the century. Wordsworth thought him
“the greatest spirit o f his gener- ation.” 9</p>

<li>THE IRISH</li>
</ol>
<p>Ireland in 1800 had approximately 4,550,000 souls, of whom 3,150,000
were Roman Catholics, 500,000 were Episcopal Protestants, and 900,000
(chiefly in Ulster) belonged to Dissenting Protestant sects. Catholics
were granted the vote in 1793, and then became eligible to most
civil-service posts; but they were still debarred from the highest
offices, from the judi- cial bench, and from the Irish Parliament; in
effect Catholics were allowed to choose among Protestant candidates to
rule Catholic Ireland. The king or his ministers appointed a Protestant
lord lieutenant, or viceroy, as chief ex- ecutive over Ireland, and
allowed him to rule the bureaucracy — and in con- siderable measure the
Irish Parliament — through bribery and the distribution or sale of
patronage. 10</p>
<p>Till 1793 all the soil of Ireland was owned by British or Irish
Protestants. After 1793 a small number of Catholics were allowed to
purchase land; the rest were tenant farmers tilling small tracts, or
were laborers on farms or in</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>factories. Rents and tithes were collected with stern regularity,
with the result that most Irish farmers lived in hopeless poverty. They
were too poor, and too shorn of incentive, to buy the new machinery that
was multiplying rural products in Britain; Irish agriculture remained
static. “The greatest</p>
<p>The Irish Catholics, like all the population, paid tithes to support
the Established Protestant Church in Ireland; but in addition they
maintained, by voluntary contributions, their Catholic clergy, who had
been stripped of their former wealth. The Roman Church naturally
supported the move- ment for Irish independence, and consequently won
the loving loyalty of the Catholic population. Here the social rebel was
usually a religious con- servative; and liberals like Thomas Moore,
though they might be friends with skeptics like Byron, never openly
wandered from Catholic orthodoxy.</p>
<p>It was a Protestant who, in the second half of the eighteenth
century, led the revolt against the exploitation of Ireland. Henry
Grattan (1746-1820) belonged to the school of two other Irishmen — Burke
and Sheridan; he be- lieved in the power of reason expressed with
eloquence. With this weapon he achieved some limited but significant
victories: repeal of the Test Act, which had required submission to the
Church of England as a prerequisite to membership in Parliament; the
removal of the more stifling restrictions on Irish trade; and the
recognition that (as he delicately put it) only the king of England,
with the consent of the Parliament of Ireland, could legis- late for
Ireland — i.e., the acts of the Irish Parliament need no longer secure
the approval of the Parliament of Great Britain. However, when Grattan
tried to win for Ireland’s Catholics full eligibility to the Irish
Parliament, he failed; Ireland remained a Catholic country ruled by a
Protestant govern- ment.</p>
<p>Theobald Wolfe Tone (1763-98) took up the battle. A graduate,
like</p>
<p>Grattan, of Trinity College, Dublin, he went to London to study law.
Re- turning, he helped to organize the Society of United Irishmen
(1791), whose aim was the cooperation of Protestants and Catholics in
pursuit of social and political reform. Pushing ahead with passion and
energy, Tone arranged a Catholic convention, whose program of action
frightened the Irish Parliament into passing the Relief Act of 1793,

<p>Tone was not satisfied. In 1794 he entered into negotiations with
William Jackson, who secretly represented the Committee of Public
Safety, then ruling a France at war with Britain. Jackson was detected
and arrested; Tone fled to the United States, and thence to France.
There he persuaded</p>
<p>chap, xxiii) England’s neighbors 509</p>
<p>Lazare Carnot, of the Committee, to sanction a French invasion of
Ireland. General Lazare Hoche received command, made Tone an adjutant
general, and sailed for Ireland on December 15, 1796, with forty-six
ships and four- teen thousand men. The expedition encountered a storm
off the English coast, and was almost totally wrecked. Tone survived,
and accompanied a smaller expeditionary force aimed to help Ireland.
This was captured by the British. Tone was sentenced to be hanged, but
escaped the noose by cutting his throat in jail (November, 1798).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Irish resentment of English rule had grown into widespread
revolt. Pitt, Britain’s prime minister, thought to quiet the movement by
conciliation. He allowed the Duke of Portland, home secretary (including
Irish affairs), to appoint as lord lieutenant William Wentworth, second
Earl Fitzwilliam, who frankly confessed his sympathy with the Irish.
After three months of service (January-March, 1795), in which he made
more conces- sions to the Catholics than Pitt thought wise, he was
recalled, and the Irish resistance became open war. For a time Irish
Protestants joined Catho- lics in attacking foreign rule; but in Ulster,
where Protestants were in the majority, they soon changed from
cooperation to opposition, fearing that the success of the rebellion
would bring Ulster under Catholic domination. In September, 1795, Ulster
Protestants formed the Orange Society, and joined the “Peep -of- Day
Boys” in burning or wrecking Catholic houses and chapels; hundreds of
Catholics fled from Ulster, fearing massacre. More and more Protestants
seceded from the United Irishmen. The Catholic remainder took to arms,
captured control of several counties, and advanced upon gov- ernment
citadels in Dublin. Grattan, in the Irish Parliament, thought to bring
peace by proposing the eligibility of Catholics to Parliament; this was
overwhelmingly rejected as involving (the Catholics now having the vote)
the early transformation of the Irish Parliament into a Catholic power.
The British general asked for and received reinforcements, and declared
martial law; for weeks the once gay capital became a hell of hatred and
killing. The count of corpses gave victory to the government; by the
fall of 1798 the rebellion had been suppressed.</p>
<p>Pitt knew that suppression was not solution, and that the smoldering
dis- content in Ireland had become a vital danger to Britain. By 1 800
England had had seven years of war with France, during which she had
profited from the chaos produced in France by the Revolution. Now,
however, Napoleon was bringing order to France and power to her armies;
he was building a fleet that would soon challenge British control of the
seas. A disaffected Ireland always on the verge of revolt was a daily
invitation to Napoleon to lead his troops across the Channel, and —
Catholics with Catholics — organize most of Ireland into a hostile force
on Britain’s flank. Some way, Pitt felt, must be found to bring the
Irish people into a safe union with Britain under one Parliament ana
king. If this could be done Pitt proposed to give the full franchise —
the vote and eligibility to office — to all adult male Catholics not
only in Ireland but throughout England, Scotland, and Wales; to admit
Catholics to one united Parliament in London; and to provide
governmental</p>

<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>salaries to dissenting ministers and Catholic priests as well as to
the clergy of the Established Church. 14 In such an arrangement religion
could become not a revolutionary ferment but a force for national unity
and public content.</p>
<p>This statesmanlike plan, preceding by a year Napoleon’s Concordat
with the Catholic Church, met with a varied opposition. Irish Catholics
suspected it as a disguise for the continued domination of Ireland by
England; Irish Protestants protested that it would subject them to rule
— perhaps vengeance and expropriation — by victorious Irish Catholics;
and the Irish Parliament was unwilling to die. Pitt hoped that in the
long run union with England — involving free trade with all parts of the
Empire — would ultimately benefit the Irish economy and reunite the
Irish as the Scots were reconciled. The Catholic majority in Ireland
might be tempered and controlled by the im- mense Protestant majority in
Britain. By a lavish use of money, sinecures, and peerages, 15 and the
support of Irish merchants, the Irish Parliament was persuaded to vote
its own death (August i, 1800). Henceforth, till 1921, Ireland was to be
ruled by the British Parliament, in which it would be represented by
four spiritual and twenty-eight temporal peers in the House of Lords,
and one hundred members in the Commons.</p>
<p>Pitt’s apparent success was darkened by his inability t o win the
King to his design. When he proposed to carry out his implied promise of
complete political emancipation to Catholics in the new “United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland,” George III refused consent, on the ground
that his coronation oath bound him to protect the Established Church of
England. When Pitt pressed him, the King gave signs of relapsing into
insanity. Pitt yielded, and, feeling compromised, he resigned from the
King’s ministry (February 3, 1801). Catholic emancipation was shelved,
and had to wait till</p>

<p>Most of the Irish leaders concluded that they had been deceived, and
that Pitt had never intended to implement his promise. Resistance to the
Union as actually annexation rose to violence. In 1803 Robert Emmet led
a forlorn revolt that made him one of the best-loved figures in Irish
history and song. He was born in Dublin (1778) as the youngest son of a
physician to the Lord Lieutenant. As a student in Trinity College he was
nearing graduation with honors when he removed his name from the roll of
undergraduates in protest against official inquisition into their
political views. He joined the United Irishmen, where his older brother
Thomas was secretary of the su- preme council. Thomas advised against
revolutionary violence, but Robert went to France, found access to
Napoleon, and pleaded for another French attempt in Ireland. Unable to
persuade Napoleon, Emmet returned to Dub- lin, gathered weapons and
allies, and planned an attack upon Dublin Castle. When he learned that
the government had discovered his plot and had ordered his arrest, he
formed an impromptu force of 1 60 men, and marched toward the castle. On
their way they encountered Lord Kilwarden, chief justice of Ireland; the
excited and unmanageable crowd killed him and his nephew on the spot.
Realizing that his effort must now fail, Emmet fled, and hid for a while
among the Wicklow Mountains. He risked discovery by</p>

<p>moving nearer to the home of his fiancee, Sarah Curran, daughter of
John Philpot Curran, Protestant defender of Catholic causes. Robert was
discov- ered, captured, tried for treason, and sentenced to death. His
speech to the jury is one of the classics of Irish eloquence:</p>
<p>I have but one request to make at my departure from the world: it is
the charity of its silence. Let no man write my epitaph; for as no man
who knows my motives dares now vindicate them, let not prejudice or
ignorance asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and
my tomb remain un- inscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other
times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country
takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then,
let my epitaph be written. 16</p>
