<h4 id="chapter-xxvii-the-industrial-revolution">CHAPTER XXVII The
Industrial Revolution</h4>
<p>I. CAUSES</p>
<p>W HY did the Industrial Revolution come to England first? Because</p>
<p>England had won great wars on the Continent while keeping its own
soil free from war’s devastation; because it had secured command of the
seas and had thereby acquired colonies that provided raw materials and
needed manufactured goods; because its armies, fleets, and growing
popula- tion offered an expanding market for industrial products;
because the guilds could not meet these widening demands; because the
profits of far-flung commerce accumulated capital seeking new avenues of
investment; because England allowed its nobles — and their fortunes — to
engage in commerce and industry; because the progressive displacement of
tillage by pasturage drove peasants from the fields to the towns, where
they added to the labor force available for factories; because science
in England was directed by men of a practical bent, while on the
Continent it was predominantly devoted to abstract research; and because
England had a constitutional government sensitive to business interests,
and vaguely aware that priority in the Indus- trial Revolution would
make England for over a century the political leader of the Western
world.</p>
<p>British command of the seas had begun with the defeat of the Spanish
Armada; it had been extended by victories over Holland in the Anglo-
Dutch wars, and over France in the War of the Spanish Succession; and
the Seven Years’ War had made oceanic commerce a lmost a British
monopoly. An invincible navy made the English Channel a protective moat
for “this fortress built by Nature… against infection and the hand of
war.” 1 The English economy was not only spared the ravages of soldiery,
it was nour- ished and stimulated by the needs of British and allied
armies on the Conti- nent; hence the special expansion of the textile
and metallurgical industries, and the call for machines to accelerate,
and for factories to multiply, pro- duction.</p>
<p>Command of the seas facilitated the conquest of colonies. Canada and
the richest parts of India fell to England as fruit of the Seven Years’
War.</p>
<p>669</p>
<p>670 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>nies took manufactured articles and sent back food, tobacco, spices,
tea, silk, cotton, raw materials, gold, silver, and precious stones.
Parliament re- stricted with high tariffs the import of foreign
manufactures, and discour- aged the development of colonial or Irish
industries competitive with those of Britain. No internal tolls (such as
those that hampered domestic trade in France) impeded the movement of
goods through England, Scotland, and Wales; these lands constituted the
largest free-trade area in Western Europe. The upper and middle classes
enjoyed the highest prosperity, and a purchas- ing power that was an
added stimulus to industrial production.</p>
<p>The guilds were not competent to meet the demands of expanding mar-
kets at home and abroad. They had been instituted chiefly to supply the
needs of a municipality and its environs; they were shackled by old
regula- tions that discouraged invention, competition, and enterprise;
they were not equipped to procure raw materials from distant sources, or
to acquire capital for enlarged production, or to calculate, obtain, or
fill orders from abroad. Gradually the guild master was replaced by
“projectors” (entrepreneurs)</p>
<p>The money was provided by the profits of commerce or finance, by the
spoils of war and privateers, by the mining or import of gold or silver,
by the great fortunes made in the slave trade or the colonies.
Englishmen went out poor, some came back rich. As early as 1744 there
were fifteen men who, returning from the West Indies, had money enough
to buy election to Parliament; 3 and by 1780 the “nabobs” who had
acquired riches in India were a power in the House of Commons. Much of
this exotic pelf was avail- able for investment. And whereas in France
the nobles were forbidden, in England they were permitted, to engage in
commerce or industry; and wealth rooted in land grew through investment
in business enterprise; so the Duke of Bridgewater risked his patrimony
in mining coal. Thousands of Britons were depositing their savings in
banks, which lent at low rates of interest. Moneylenders were
everywhere. Bankers had discovered that the easiest way to make money is
to handle other people’s money. There were</p>
<p>The multiplying shops and factories needed men. The natural supply of
labor was augmented by the rising number of rural families that could no
longer make a living on the farm. The flourishing wool industry demanded
wool; more and more land was withdrawn from tillage and given to pas-
turage; sheep replaced men; Goldsmith’s Auburn was not the only deserted
village in Britain. Between 1702 and 1760 there had been 246 acts of
Parlia- ment authorizing the removal of four hundred acres from
planting; between</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>671</p>
<p>1760 and 1810 there were 2,438 such acts, affecting nearly five
million acres. 7 As agricultural machinery improved, small holdings
became unde- sirable, because they could not use or pay for the new
machines; thousands of farmers sold their land and became hired hands on
large-scale farms or in rural mills or in the towns. The large farms,
with better methods, organ- ization, and machines, produced more per
acre than the farms of the past, but they almost wiped out the yeomen,
or peasant proprietors, who had been the economic, military, and moral
backbone of England. Meanwhile immigration from Ireland and the
Continent added to the men, women, and children who competed for jobs in
the factories.</p>
<p>Science played only a modest part in the economic transformation of
eighteenth-century England. The researches of Stephen Hales on gases, of
Joseph Black on heat and steam, helped Watt to improve the steam engine.
The Royal Society of London was composed mostly of practical men, who
favored studies that promised industrial application. The British
Parliament too had a mind for material considerations; though it was
dominated by landowners, several of these took a hand in commerce or
industry, and most of the members were amenable to the pleas and gifts
of businessmen for relaxing the restrictions that earlier governments
had laid upon the econ- omy. The advocates of free enterprise and free
trade — and of wages and prices left free to rise or fall with the laws
of supply and demand — won the support of several parliamentary leaders,
and the legal barriers to the spread of commerce and manufactures were
slowly broken down. All the condi- tions prerequisite to English
priority in the Industrial Revolution were ful-</p>
<p>filled.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>COMPONENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The material elements of the Industrial Revolution were iron, coal,
trans- portation, machinery, power, and factories. Nature played its
part by pro- viding England with iron, coal, and liquid roads. But iron
as it came from the mines was permeated with impurities, from which it
had to be freed by smelting — melting or fusing with fire. Coal too was
alloyed with impurities; these were removed by heating or “cooking” coal
till it became coke. Iron ore heated and purified to diverse degrees by
burning coke became wrought iron, cast iron, or steel.</p>
<p>To increase the heat Abraham Darby built (1754 f.) blast furnaces in
which extra air was supplied to the fire from a pair of bellows worked
by a water wheel. In 1760 John Smeaton replaced the bellows with a
compressed- air pump driven partly by water, partly by steam; the
constant high-pressure blast raised the production of industrial iron
from twelve tons to forty tons per furnace per day. 8 Iron became cheap
enough to be used in hundreds of new ways; so, in 1763, Richard Reynolds
built the first known railway — iron tracks that enabled cars to replace
pack horses in transporting coal and ore.</p>
<p>Now began an age of famous ironmasters who dominated the
industrial</p>
<p>6 -] 2</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>scene and made great fortunes by using iron for purposes that seemed
quite alien to that metal. So John Wilkinson and Abraham Darby II
spanned the River Severn with the first iron bridge (1779). Wilkinson
amused England by proposing an iron ship; some said he had lost his
mind; but, relying upon principles established by Archimedes, he put
together with metal sheets the first iron vessel known to history
(1787). Businessmen came from abroad to see and study the great works
set up by Wilkinson, Richard Crawshay, or Anthony Bacon. Birmingham,
close to extensive deposits of coal and iron, became the leading center
of England’s iron industry. From such shops new tools and machines,
stronger, more durable and reliable, were poured into Britain’s shops
and factories.</p>
<p>Coal and iron were heavy, costly to convey except by water. A richly
indented coastline allowed maritime transport to reach many major cities
of Britain. To bring materials and products to towns distant from the
coast and navigable streams a revolution in transportation had to be
effected. The movement of goods overland was still difficult despite the
network of turn- pikes built between 1751 and 1771. (They took their
name from the pike- studded turnstiles that obstructed passage until
toll was paid.) 9 These toll roads doubled the speed of transit and
quickened internal trade. Pack horses were superseded by horse-drawn
carts, and travel by horseback gave way to stage coaches. The turnpikes,
however, were left to private enterprise for their maintenance, and
rapidly deteriorated.</p>
<p>So commercial traffic still preferred the waterways. Streams were
dredged to bear heavy vessels, and rivers and towns were bound with one
another by canals. James Brindley, without formal or technical
education, grew from a letterless millwright into the most remarkable
canal engineer of the time, solving by his mechanical bent the problems
of carrying canals through locks and tunnels and over aqueducts. In
1759-61 he built a canal that brought to Manchester the coal from the
mines of the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley; this cut in half the cost
of coal at Manchester, and played a principal part in making that city
an industrial metropolis. One of the most picturesque sights in
eighteenth-century England was a ship moving along the
Brindley-Bridgewater canal carried by an aqueduct ninety-nine feet high
over the River Irwell at Barton. In 1766 Brindley began the Grand Trunk
Canal, which, by connecting the Rivers Trent and Mersey, opened a water
route across mid-England from the Irish to the North Sea. Other canals
bound the Trent with the Thames, and Manchester with Liverpool. In a
period of thirty years hundreds of new canals greatly reduced the cost
of commercial traffic in Britain.</p>
<p>Given materials, fuels, and transportation, the Industrial Revolution
had next to multiply goods. The demand for machines to accelerate
production was greatest in textiles. People wanted to be clothed, and
soldiers and lasses had to be hypnotized with uniforms. Cotton was
entering England in rapidly rising amounts — three million pounds in
1753, thirty-two million in 1789; 10 hand labor could not process this
into finished goods in time to meet demand. The division of labor that
had developed in the clothing trades suggested and promoted the
invention of machines.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII )</p>
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>6 73</p>
<p>John Kay had begun t he mechanization of weaving by his “flying
shuttle” (1733), and Lewis Paul had mechanized spinning by a system of
rollers (1738). In 1765 James Hargreaves of Blackburn, Lancashire,
changed the position of the spinning wheel from vertical to horizontal,
placed one wheel on top of another, turned eight of them by one pulley
and belt, and wove eight threads at once; he added more power to more
spindles until his “spin - ning jenny” (Jenny was his wife) wove eighty
threads at a time. Hand spinners feared that this contraption would
throw them out of work and food; they broke up Hargreaves’ machines; he
fled for his life to Notting - ham, where a shortage of labor allowed
his jennies to be installed. By 1788 there were twenty thousand of them
in Britain, and the spinning wheel was on its way to becoming a romantic
ornament.</p>
<p>In 1769 Richard Arkwright, using the suggestions of various
mechanics, developed a “water frame” by which water power moved cotton
fibers be - tween a succession of rollers that pulled and stretched the
fibers into tighter, harder yarn. About 1774 Samuel Crompton combined
Hargreaves’ jenny and Arkwright’s rollers into a hybrid machine which
English wit called “Crompton’s mule”: an alternate backward and forward
mot ion of the ro- tating spindles stretched, twisted, and wound the
thread, giving it greater fineness and strength; this procedure remained
till our time the principle of the most complex textile machinery. The
jenny and the water frame had been made of wood; the mule, after 1783,
used metal rollers and wheels, and became sturdy enough to bear the
speed and strain of power operation.</p>
<p>Power looms worked by cranks and weights had been used in Germany and
France, but in 1787 Edmund Cartwright built at Doncaster a small fac-
tory in which twenty looms were operated by animal motion. In 1789 he
replaced this power plant by a steam engine. Two years later he joined
with some Manchester friends to set up a large factory in which four
hun- dred looms were run by steam. Here too the workers rebelled; they
burned the factory to the ground and threatened to kill the promoters.
In the en- suing decade many power looms were built, rioters smashed
some of them, some survived and multiplied; the machines won.</p>
<p>England had been helped to industry through water power from numer-
ous streams fed by abundant rain. So, in the eighteenth century, mills
were erected not so much in the towns as in the countryside, along
streams that could be dammed to create waterfalls of sufficient force to
turn great wheels. At this point a poet might wonder had it not been
better if steam had never replaced water as a motive force, and
industry, instead of being con- gregated in cities, had been mingled
with agriculture in the rural scene. But the more effective and
profitable method of production displaces the less, and the steam engine
(which also, till lately, had a romantic glow) promised to produce or
transport more goods and gold than the world had ever seen before.</p>
<p>The steam engine was the culmination, not quite a product, of the
Indus- trial Revolution. Not to go back to Hero of Alexandria ( a.
d. 200?), Denis Papin described all the components and principles of a
practical steam en-</p>
<p>^74 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>gine in 1690. Thomas Savery built a steam-driven pump in 1698. Thomas
Newcomen developed this (1708-12) into a machine in which steam gen-
erated by heated water was condensed by a jet of cold water, and the
alter- nation of atmospher ic pressure drove a piston up and down; this
“atmos - pheric engine” remained the standard until James Watt
transformed it into a true steam engine in 1765.</p>
<p>Unlike most inventors of that time, Watt was a student as well as a
prac- tical man. His grandfather was a teacher of mathematics; his
father was an architect, shipbuilder, and magistrate in the borough of
Greenock in south- west Scotland. James had no college education, but he
had creative curiosity and a mechanical bent. Half the world knows the
story that an aunt re- proved him: “I never saw such an idle boy as you
are:… for the last hour you have not spoken one word, but you have taken
off the lid of that kettle, and put it on again, and, holding now a cap
and now a silver spoon over the steam, watching how it rises from the
spout, and catching and counting the drops.” 11 This has the odor of
legend. However, an extant manuscript in James Watt’s hand describes an
experiment in which “the straight end of a pipe w as fixed on the spout
of a Tea Kettle”; and another manuscript reads: “I took a bent glass
tube and inverted it into the nose of a tea kettle, the other end being
immersed in cold water.” 12</p>
<p>At the age of twenty (1756) Watt tried to set up in Glasgow as a
maker of scientific instruments. The city guilds refused him a license
on the ground that he had not completed the full term of apprenticeship,
but the Univer- sity of Glasgow gave him a workshop within its grounds.
He attended the chemistry lectures of Joseph Black, won his friendship
and aid, and was especially interested in Black’s theory of latent heat.
13 He learned German, French, and Italian to read foreign books,
including metaphysics and poetry. Sir James Robison, who knew him at
that ti me (1758), was struck by Watt’s varied knowledge, and said, “I
saw a workman and expected no more; I found a philosopher.” 14</p>
<p>In 1763 the university asked him to repair a model of Newcomen’s
engine used in a physics course. He was surprised to find that three
fourths of the heat supplied to the machine were wasted: after each
stroke of the piston the cylinder lost heat through the use of cold
water to condense the new</p>
<p>supply of steam entering the cylinder; so much energy was lost that
most manufacturers had judged the machine unprofitable. Watt proposed to
con- dense the steam in a separate container, whose low temperature
would not affect the cylinder in which the piston moved. This
“condenser” increased by some three hundred per cent the efficiency of
the machine in the propor- tion of fuel used to work done. Moreover, in
Watt’s reconstruction, the piston was moved by the expansion of steam,
not of air; he had made a true steam engine.</p>
<p>The passage from plans and models to practical application consumed
twelve years of Watt’s life. To make successive samples and improvements
of his engine he borrowed over a thousand pounds, chiefly from Joseph
Black, who never lost faith in him. John Smeaton, himself an inventor
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>675</p>
<p>engineer, predicted that Watt’s engine could “never be brought into
general use because of the difficulty of getting its parts manufactured
with sufficient precision.” 15 In 1 765 Watt married, and had to earn
more money; he put aside his invention and took to surveying and
engineering, drawing up plans for harbors, bridges, and canals.
Meanwhile Black introduced him to John Roe- buck, who was looking for a
more effective engine than Newcomen’s for pumping water from the coal
mines that supplied fuel for his ironworks at Carron. In 1767 he agreed
to pay Watt’s debts and provide capital for build - ing engines to
Watt’s specifications, in return for two th irds of the profits from
installations or sales. To protect their investment Watt in 1769 asked
Parliament for a patent that would give him sole right to produce his
engine; it was granted him till 1783. He and Roebuck set up an engine
near Edin- burgh, but poor workmanship by the smiths made it a failure;
in some cases the cylinders made for Watt were an eighth of an inch
greater in diameter at one end than at the other.</p>
<p>Pressed by reverses, Roebuck sold his share of the partnership to
Matthew Boulton (1773). Now began an alliance notable in the history of
friendship as well as of industry. Boulton was no mere moneymaker; he
was so inter- ested in improving his modes and mechanisms of production
that in achiev- ing this he lost a fortune. In 1760, aged thirty-two, he
married a rich woman and might have retired on her income; instead he
built at Soho, near Bir- mingham, one of England’s most extensive
industrial plants, manufacturing a great variety of metal articles from
shoe buckles to chandeliers. To operate the machines in the five
buildings of his factory he had relied on water power. He proposed now
to try steam power. He knew that Watt had shown the inefficiency of the
Newcomen engine, and that Watt’s engine had failed because of
inaccurately bored cylinders. He took a calculated risk that this defect
could be overcome. In 1774 he moved Watt’s engine to Soho; in 1775 Watt
followed it. Parliament extended the patent from 1783 to 1800.</p>
<p>In 1775 ironmaster Wilkinson invented a hollow cylindrical boring bar
that enabled Boulton and Watt to produce engines of unprecedented power
and competence. Soon the new firm was selling engines to manufacturers
and mine owners throughout Britain. Boswell visited Soho in 1776, and
re- ported:</p>
<p>Mr. Hector was so good as to accompany me to see the great works of
Mr. Boulton…. I wished Johnson had been with us, for it was a scene
which I should have been glad to contemplate by his light. The vastness
and the con- triva nces of some of the machinery would have “matched his
mighty mind.” I shall never forget Mr. Boulton’s expression to me: “I
sell here, Sir, what all the</p>
<p>Watt’s engines were still unsatisfactory, and he constantly labored
to improve them. In 1781 he patented a device by which the reciprocal
motion of the piston was converted into rotating motion, thereby
adapting the en-</p>
<p>6j6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>gine for driving ordinary machinery. In 1782 he patented a
double-acting engine, in which both ends of the cylinder received
impulses from the boiler and the condenser. In 1788 he patented a “fly -
ball governor” that adjusted the flow of steam to promote uniform speed
in the engine. During these experimental years other inventors were
making competitive engines, and it was not till 1783 that Wa tt’s sales
paid off his debts and began to bring in gains. When his patent expired
he retired from active work, and the firm of Boulton and Watt was
carried on by their sons. Watt amused himself with minor inventions, and
lived into a cheerful old age, dying in 1819 at the age of
eighty-three.</p>
<p>There were many other inventions in this exuberant age, when, as Dean
Tucker said, “almost every master manufacturer hath a new invention of
his own, and is daily improving on those of others.” 17 Watt himself
devel- oped a duplicating process by using a glutinous ink and pressing
the written or printed page against a moistened sheet of thin paper
(1780). One of his employees, William Murdock, applied Watt’s engine to
traction, and built a model locomotive that traveled eight miles an hour
(1784). Murdock shared with Philippe Lebon of France the distinction of
using coal gas for illumination; he so lighted the exterior of the Soho
factory (1798). The central view of the English economy at the end of
the eighteenth century is one of the steam engine leading and quickening
the pace, harnessing itself to machines in a hundred industries, luring
textile works from water to steam power (1785 f.), changing the
countryside, invading the towns, dark- ening the sky with coal dust and
fumes, and hiding in the bowels of ships to give new force to England’s
mastery of the seas.</p>
<p>Two other elements were needed to make the revolution complete: fac-
tories and capital. The components — fuel, power, materials, machines,
and men — could co-operate best when brought together in one building or
plant, in one organization and discipline, under one head. There had
been factories before; now, as the widened market called for regular and
large-scale pro- duction, they multiplied in number and size, and “the
factory system” be - came one name for the new order in industry. And as
industrial machinery and plants became more costly, the men and
institutions that could collect or furnish capital rose to power, the
banks surmounted the factories, and the entire complex took the name of
capitalism — an economy dominated by the providers of capital. Now, with
every stimulus to invention and com- petition, with enterprise
increasingly freed from guild restrictions and leg- islative barriers,
the Industrial Revolution was ready to remake the face and sky and soul
of Britain.</p>

<li>CONDITIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>Both employer and employee had to change their habits, skills, and
rela- tions. The employer, dealing with ever more men, and in a faster
turnover, lost intimacy with them, and had to think of them not as
acquaintances en- gaged in a common task, but as particles in a process
that would be judged</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl) THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 677</p>
<p>by profits alone. Most artisans, before 1760, worked in guild shops
or at home, where the hours of labor were not inflexible, and intervals
of rest might be allowed; and in an earlier age there had been holy days
in which all gainful labor was forbidden by the Church. We must not
idealize the condition of the common man before the Industrial
Revolution; nevertheless we may say that the hardships to which he was
subjected were such as had tradition, habituation, and in many cases the
open air to soften them. As industrialization advanced, the hardships of
the employee were mitigated by shorter hours, higher wages, and wider
access to the increasing flow of goods from the machines. But the half
century of transition from craft and home to factory, after 1760, was
for the laborers of England one of inhuman subjection sometimes worse
than slavery.</p>
<p>Most factor’ os in that period required twelve to fourteen hours of
work per day six days a week. 18 Employers argued that the laborer had
to be kept for long hours because he could not be relied upon to report
regularly: many workers drank too heavily on Sunday to come in on
Monday; some others, after working for four days, stayed home the next
three. Adam Smith explained that “excessive application du ring four
days of the week is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the
other three”; he warned that</p>
<p>Real wages, of course, can be estimated only in connection with
prices. In 1770 a four-pound loaf of bread in Nottingham cost about
sixpence, a pound of cheese or pork fourpence, a pound of butter
sevenpence. Adam Smith, toward 1773, calculated the average wage of
London workers at 10 shillings, in smaller centers 7 shillings, in
Edinburgh 5 shillings. 20 Arthur Young, about 1770, reported the weekly
wages of English industrial workers as varying geographically from six
shillings sixpence to 1 1 shillings. Wages were evi- dently much lower
in relation to prices than now, but some employers added fuel or rent to
the wages, and some employees gave part of their time to agricultural
work. After 1793, when England began her long war with Revolutionary
France, prices rose much faster than wages, and poverty be- came
desperate.</p>
<p>Many eighteenth-century economists recommended low wages as a stim-
ulus to steady work. Even Arthur Young, who was disturbed by the poverty
that he saw in some districts of France, declared: “Everyone but an
idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never
be in- dustrious.” 21 Or, as one J. Smith put it:</p>
<p>It is a fact well known to those who are conversant in this matter,
that scar- city, to a certain degree, promotes industry, and that the
manufacturer [i.e., manual work er] who can subsist on three days’ work,
will be idle and drunk the remainder of the week…. Upon the whole we can
fairly aver that a re- duction of wages in the woolen manufacture would
be a national blessing, and no real injury to the poor. By this means we
might keep our trade, uphold our rents [revenues], and reform the people
into the bargain. 22</p>
<p>678 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>Women and children were employed in the factories, usually for
unskilled operations. Some skilled women weavers made as much as their
men, but the usual earnings of factory women averaged three shillings
sixpence — rarely more than half the wage of men. 23 Textile mills
alone, in 1788, employed 59,000 women and 48,000 children. 24 Sir Robert
Peel had over a thousand children in his Lancashire factories. 25 Child
labor was no new practice in Europe; it had been taken for granted on
the farms and in domestic industry. Since universal education was
frowned upon by conservatives as leading to a surplus of scholars and a
dearth of manual laborers, very few Englishmen in the eighteenth century
saw any evil in children going to work instead of to school. When
machines were simple enough to be tended by children, fac- tory owners
welcomed boys and girls five years old or more. Parish authori- ties,
resenting the cost of supporting orphans or pauper children, gladly
farmed them out to industrialists, sometimes in lots of fifty, eighty,
or a hun- dred; in several cases they stipulated that the employer
should take one idiot to every twenty children. 26 The usual working day
for child laborers was from ten to fourteen hours. They were often
housed in groups, and in some factories they worked in twelve-hour
shifts, so that the machines rarely stopped and the beds were seldom
unoccupied. Discipline was maintained by blows or kicks. Disease found
defenseless victims in these factory appren- tices; many were deformed
by their labor, or were maimed by accidents; some killed themselves. A
few men were delicate enough to condemn such child labor; however, it
diminished not because men became more humane but because machines
became more complex.</p>
<p>Children, women, and men were subjected in the factories to
conditions and disciplines not known to them before. The buildings were
often of hasty or flimsy construction, assuring many accidents and much
disease. Rules were severe, and violations of them were punished by
fines that might forfeit the wages of a day. 27 Employers argued that
the proper care of the ma- chinery, the necessity of co-ordinating
different operations, and the lax habits of a population not accustomed
to regularity or speed required a rigorous discipline if confusion and
waste were not to cancel profits and to price the product out of the
market at home or abroad. The discipline was endured because an
unemployed artisan faced hunger and cold for himself and his family, and
the employee knew that the unemployed were eager for his job. Hence it
was to the advantage of the employer to have a pool of un- employment
from which to take replacements for workers disabled, dissatis- fied, or
dismissed. Even the well-behaved and competent employee faced dismissal
when “overproduction” saturated the av ailable market beyond its buying
power, or when peace put an end to the blessed willingness of armies to
order more and more goods and to destroy them as rapidly as
possible.</p>
<p>Under the guild system the workers were protected by guild or
municipal ordinances, but in the new industrialism they had little
protection by the law, or none at all. The propaganda of the physiocrats
for leaving the econ- omy free from regulation had made headway in
England as in France; the employers convinced Parliament that they could
not continue their opera-</p>

<p>ions, or meet foreign competition, unless wages were governed by the
laws of supply and demand. In village mills the justices of the peace
retained some control over wages; in the factories, after 1757, they had
none. 28 The upper and middle classes saw no reason for interfering with
the captains of in- dustry; the swelling flood of exports was conquering
new markets for British trade; and Englishmen who could pay were pleased
with the abundance of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>But the workers did not share in this prosperity. Despite the
multiplication of goods by the machines they tended, they themselves
remained as poor in 1 800 as they had been a century before. 29 They no
longer owned the tools of their trade, they had little part in designing
the product, they took no profit from the widening of the market they
fed. They added to their pov- erty by continuing the high fertility that
had paid living dividends on the farm; they found in drink and sex their
chief consolation, and their women were still rated by the number of
children they bore. Pauperism spread; the expenditure for poor relief
rose from ,£600,000 in 1742 to ,£2,000,000 in</p>
<ol start="1784" type="1">
<li>30 The growth of housing could not keep up with the immigration or
multiplication of industrial workers; these had often to live in
tumble-down dwellings that crowded one another in dismal and narrow
streets. Some la- borers lived in cellars, whose dampness added to the
causes of disease. By 1800 all the larger towns had developed slums in
which living conditions were worse than anything known in the previous
history of England.</li>
</ol>
<p>The workers tried to better their lot by riots, strikes, and
organization. They attacked the inventions that threatened them with
unemployment or drudgery. Parliament in 1769 made the destruction of
machinery a capital crime. 31 Nevertheless in 1779 the workers in
Lancashire factories formed themselves into a mob that grew from five
hundred to eight thousand men; they collected firearms and ammunition,
melted their pewter dishes to make bullets, and swore to demolish every
machine in England. At Bolton they completely wrecked a factory and its
equipment; at Altham they took by storm the textile factory of Robert
Peel (father of Sir Robert the minister), and smashed its costly
equipment. They were on their way to attack the plant of Arkwright at
Cromford when troops sent from Liverpool came up with them, whereupon
they fled in a rout. Some of them were caught and were sentenced to be
hanged. The justices of the peace explained that “de - stroying machines
in this country would only be the means of transferring them to other
countries ,… to the detriment of the trade of Britain.” 32 An anonymous
“Friend of the Poor” bade the workers be more patient: “All improvements
by machines do at first produce some difficulties to some par- ticular
persons….Was not the first effect of the printing press to deprive many
copyists of their occupation?” 33</p>
<p>The law forbade the formation of labor unions for collective
bargaining; however, “journeymen’s associations” existed, some dating
from the seven - teenth century. In the eighteenth they were numerous,
especially among textile workers. They were primarily social clubs or
mutual-benefit so- cieties, but as the century advanced they became more
aggressive; and some-</p>

<p>imes, when Parliament rejected their petitions, they organized
strikes. In 1767-68, for example, there were strikes of sailors,
weavers, hatters, tailors, glass grinders; and several of these walkouts
were accompanied by armed violence on both sides. 34 Adam Smith
summarized the results to 1776:</p>
<p>It is not difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon
all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the
other into compli- ance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in
number, can combine much more easily, and the law… does not prohibit
their combinations, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no
acts of Parliament against com- bining to lower the price [wages] of
work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the
masters can hold out much longer…. Many workmen could not subsist a
week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without
employment. 35</p>
<p>The employers had their way, both in the factories and in Parliament;
in 1 799 the Commons declared illegal any associations aiming to secure
higher wages, to alter the hours of work, or to decrease the quantity of
work re- quired of the workers. Employees entering into such
combinations were punishable by imprisonment, and informers against such
men were to be indemnified. 36 The triumph of the employers was
complete.</p>

<p>made the map of the world by assuring for 1 50 years the British
control of the seas and the most profitable colonies. It furthered
imperialism by leading England — and, later, other industrial states —
to conquer foreign areas which could provide raw materials, markets, or
facilities for commerce or war. It compelled agricultural nations to
industrialize and militarize themselves in order to obtain or maintain
their freedom; and it created economic, political, or military
interrelations that made independence imaginary and interde- pendence
real.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>It changed England in character and culture by multiplying its
popu- lation, industrializing half of it, shifting it northward and
westward to towns near deposits of coal or iron, or near waterways or
the sea; so grew Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham,
Liverpool, Bristol… The Industrial Revolution transformed large expanses
of England, and of other industrialized countries, into blotches of land
fuming with factories, chok- ing with gases and dust; and it deposited
its human slag into reeking and hopeless slums.</p></li>
<li><p>It mechanized, extended, and depersonalized war, and vastly
improved man’s ability to destroy or kill.</p></li>
<li><p>It compelled better and faster communication and transportation.
Thereby it made possible greater industrial combinations, and the
govern- ment of larger areas from one capital.</p></li>
<li><p>It generated democracy by raising the business class to
predominant wealth, and, in gradual consequence, to political supremacy.
To effect and protect this epochal shift of power, the new class
enlisted the support of an increasing segment of the masses, confident
that these could be kept in line by control of the means of information
and indoctrination. Despite this con- trol, the people of industrial
states became the best-informed publics in mod- ern history.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the developing Industrial Revolution required ever more
edu- cation in workers and managers, the new class financed schools,
libraries, and universities on a scale hardly dreamed of before. The aim
was to train technical intelligence; the by-product was an unprecedented
extension of secular intelligence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>1 1. The new economy spread goods and comforts among a far greater
proportion of the population than any previous system, for it could
sustain its ever-rising productivity only by ever-widening purchasing
power in the people.</p>

<li><p>It sharpened the urban mind, but dulled the aesthetic sense; many
cities became depressingly ugly, and at last art itself renounced the
pursuit of beauty. The dethronement of the aristocracy removed a
repository and court of standards and tastes, and lowered the level of
literature and art.</p></li>
<li><p>The Industrial Revolution raised the importance and status of
eco- nomics, and led to the economic interpretation of history. It
habituated men to think in terms of physical cause and effect, and led
to mechanistic theories in biology — the attempt to explain all the
processes of life as mechanical op- erations.</p></li>

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>These developments in science, and similar tendencies in
philosophy, combined with urban conditions and expanding wealth to
weaken religious belief.</p></li>
<li><p>The Industrial Revolution transformed morality. It did not change
the nature of man, but it gave new powers and opportunities to old
instincts primitively useful, socially troublesome. It emphasized the
profit motive to a point where it seemed to encourage and intensify the
natural selfishness of man. The unsocial instincts had been checked by
parental authority, by moral instruction in the schools, and by
religious indoctrination. The Indus- trial Revolution weakened all these
checks. In the agricultural regime the family was the unit of economic
production as well as of racial continuance and social order; it worked
together on the land under the discipline of the parents and the
seasons; it taught co-operation and molded character. Indus- trialism
made the individual and the company the units of production; the parents
and the family lost the economic basis of their authority and moral
function. As child labor became unprofitable in the cities, children
ceased to be economic assets; birth control spread, most among the more
intelligent, least among the less, with unexpected results to ethnic
relations and theo- cratic power. As family limitation, and mechanical
devices, freed woman from maternal cares and domestic chores, she was
drawn into factories and offices; emancipation was industrialization. As
the sons took longer to reach economic self-support, the lengthened
interval between biological and eco- nomic maturity made premarital
continence more difficult, and broke down the moral code that early
economic maturity, early marriage, and religious sanctions had made
possible on the farm. Industrial societies found them- selves drifting
in an amoral interregnum between a moral code that was dy- ing and a new
one still unformed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Industrial Revolution is still proceeding, and it is beyond the
capac- ity of one mind to comprehend it in all its facets, or to pass
moral judgment upon its results. It has begotten new quantities and
varieties of crime, and it has inspired scientists with all the heroic
dedication of missionaries and nuns. It has produced ugly buildings,
dismal streets, and squalid slums, but these were not derived from its
essence, which is to replace human labor with mechanical power. It is
already attacking its own evils, for it has found that slums cost more
than education, and that the reduction of poverty enriches the rich.
Functional architecture and mechanical excellence — as in a bridge- can
produce a beauty that mates science with art. Beauty becomes profitable,
and industrial design takes its place among the arts and embellishments
of life.</p>
