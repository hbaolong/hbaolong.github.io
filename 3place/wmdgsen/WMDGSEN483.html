<h4 id="chapter-xiv">CHAPTER XIV</h4>
<p>Erasmus the Forerunner</p>
<p>1469-1517</p>
<p>I. THE EDUCATION OF A HUMANIST</p>
<p>T HE greatest of the humanists was bom in or near Rotterdam in 1466
or 1469, the second and natural son of Gerard, a clerk in minor orders,
and of Margaret, the widowed daughter of a physician. Apparently the
father became a priest shortly after this contretemps. We do not know
how the boy came by the fond name of Desiderius Erasmus, meaning the
desired beloved. His first teachers taught him to read and write Dutch,
but when he went to study with the Brethren of the Common Life at
Deventer he was fined for speaking his native tongue; there Latin was
the piece de resistance, and piety was as rigorous as discipline.
Nevertheless the Brethren encouraged the study of selected pagan
classics, and Erasmus began at Deventer to ac- quire his astonishing
command of the Latin language and literature. About 1484 both his
parents died. The father left a modest estate to his two sons, but their
guardians absorbed most of it, and steered the youths into a monastic
career as one requiring no patrimony at all. They protested, wishing to
go to a university; finally they were persuaded — Erasmus, we are told,
by the promise of access to many books. The older son accepted his fate,
and rose to be (Erasmus reported) strenuus compotor nec scortator
ignavus —“a. mighty toper and no mean fornicator.” 1 Desiderius took
vows as an Augustinian canon in the priory of Emmaus at Steyn. He tried
hard to like monastic life, even wrote an essay De contemptu mundi to
convince himself that a monastery was just the place for a lad of avid
spirit and queasy stomach. But his stomach complained of fasts and
turned at the smell of fish; the vow of obedience proved yet more
irksome than that of chastity; and perhaps the monastic library ran
short on classics. The kindly prior took pity on him, and lent him as
secretary to Henry of Bergen, Bishop of Cambrai. Erasmus now (1492)
accepted ordination as a priest.</p>
<p>But wherever he was he had one foot elsewhere. 2 He envied the young
men who had gone on from their local schooling to universities. Paris
exuded an aroma of learning and lust that could intoxicate keen senses
across great distances. After some years of able service, Desiderius
induced the Bishop to send him to the University of Paris, armed with
just enough money to</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>survive. He listened impatiently to lectures, but consumed the
libraries. He attended plays and parties, and occasionally explored
feminine charms; 3 he remarks, in one of his Colloquies, that the most
pleasant way of learning French was from the filles de jote , 4
Nevertheless his strongest passion was for literature, the musical magic
of words opening the door to a world of imagination and delight. He
taught himself Greek; in time the Athens of Plato and Euripides, Zeno
and Epicurus became as familiar to him as the Rome of Cicero, Horace,
and Seneca; and both cities were almost as real to him as the left bank
of the Seine. Seneca seemed to him as good a Christian as St. Paul, and
a much better stylist (a point on which, perhaps, his taste was not
quite sound). Wandering at will through the centuries, he discovered
Lorenzo Valla, the Neapolitan Voltaire; he relished the elegant Latin
and reckless audacity with which Valla had flayed the forgery of the
“Donation of Constantine,” had noted serious errors in the Vulgate, and
had debated</p>
<p>His addiction to books was almost as expensive as a vice. To add to
his allowance he gave private instruction to younger students, and went
to live with one of them. Even so he had not enough to be comfortable.
He impor- tuned the Bishop of Cambrai: “My skin and my purse both need
filling— the one with flesh, the other with coins. Act with your usual
kindness”; 6 to which the Bishop responded with his usual moderation.
One pupil, the Lord of Vere, invited him to his castle at Tournehem in
Flanders; Erasmus was charmed to find in Lady Anne of Vere a patroness
of genius; she recognized this condition in him, and helped him with a
gift, which was soon consumed. Another rich pupil, Mountjoy, took him to
England (1499). There, in the great country houses of the aristocracy,
the harassed scholar found a realm of refined pleasure that turned his
monastic past into a shuddering memory. He reported his progress to a
friend in Paris, in one of those innumerable, inimitable letters that
are now his most living monument:</p>
<p>We are getting on. If you are wise you too will fly over here. …
If</p>
<p>you only knew the blessings of Britain! … To take one attraction</p>
<p>out of many: there are nymphs here with divine features, so
gentle</p>
<p>and kind. . . . Moreover, there is a fashion that cannot be commended
enough. Wherever you go you are received on all hands with kisses; when
you leave you are dismissed with kisses; if you go back your</p>
<p>salutes are returned to you. . . . Wherever a meeting takes place
there</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) ERASMUS THE FORERUNNER 273</p>
<p>are salutes in abundance; wherever you turn you are never without
them. O Faustus! if you had once tasted how soft and fragrant those lips
are, you would wish to be a traveler, not for ten years, like Solon, but
for your whole life in England . 7</p>
<p>At Mountjoy’s house in Greenwich Erasmus met Thomas A 4 ore, then
only twenty-two, yet distinguished enough to secure the scholar an
intro- duction to the future Henry VIII. At Oxford he was almost as
charmed by the informal companionship of students and faculty as he had
been by the embraces of country-house divinities. There he learned to
love John Colet, who, though “assertor and champion of the old
theology,” astonished his time by practicing Christianity. Erasmus was
impressed by the progress of humanism in England:</p>
<p>When I hear my Colet I seem to be listening to Plato himself. In</p>
<p>Grocyn who does not marvel at such a perfect world of learning?</p>
<p>What can be more acute, profound, and delicate than the judgment of
Linacre? What has nature ever created more gentle, sweet, and</p>
<p>happy than the genius of Thomas More? 8</p>
<p>These men influenced Erasmus profoundly for his betterment. From a
vain and flighty youth, drunk with the wine of the classics and the
ambrosia of women, he was transformed into an earnest and painstaking
scholar, anxious not merely for shillings and renown, but for some
lasting and beneficent achievement. When he left England (January 1500)
he had formed his resolve to study and edit the Greek text of the New
Testament as the dis- tilled essence of that real Christianity which, in
the judgment of reformers and humanists alike, had been overlaid and
concealed by the dogmas and accretions of centuries.</p>
<p>His pleasant memory of this first visit to England was darkened by
the final hour. At Dover, passing through the customs, the money that
his English friends had given him, amounting to some £ 20 (,000?), was
confiscated by the authorities, as the English law forbade the export of
gold or silver. More, not yet a great lawyer, had mistakenly advised him
that the prohibition applied only to English currency; and Erasmus had
changed the pounds into French coins. Neither his stumbling English nor
his prancing Latin availed to deflect the avid orthodoxy of the law; and
Erasmus embarked for France practically penniless. “I suffered
shipwreck,” he said, “before 1 went to sea.” 9</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE PERIPATETIC</li>
</ol>
<p>Stationing himself for a few months in Paris, he published his first
signifi- cant work, Collectanea adagiorum, a collection of 818 adages or
quotations,</p>
<p>274 the reformation (chap.xiv</p>
<p>mostly from classical authors. The revival of learning — i.e., of
ancient liter- ature- had set a fashion of adorning one’s opinions with
a snatch from some Greek or Latin author; we see the custom in extreme
form in Montaigne’s Essays and Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy ; it
lingered into the eighteenth</p>
<p>Even so the proceeds were meager; and food was not enough. Pinched
for pounds, Erasmus wrote (December 12, 1500) to his friend James Batt,
who was tutoring a son of the Lady Anne of Vere, asking him to</p>
<p>point out to her how much more credit I shall do her by my learning
than the other divines whom she maintains. They preach ordinary</p>
<p>sermons; I write what will live forever. They, with their silly
rub-</p>
<p>bish, are heard in one or two churches; my works will be read by
all</p>
<p>who know Latin and Greek in every country in the world. Such</p>
<p>unlearned ecclesiastics abound everywhere; men like me are scarcely
found in many centuries. Repeat all this to her unless you are too</p>
<p>superstitious to tell a few fibs for a friend. 11</p>
<p>When this approach failed, he wrote again in January, suggesting that
Batt tell the lady that Erasmus w as losing his eyesight, and adding:
“Send me four or five gold pieces of your own, which you will recover
out of the Lady’s money.” 12 As Batt did not enter this trap, Erasmus
wrote directly to the lady, comparing her with the noblest heroines of
history and the fairest con- cubines of Solomon, and predicting for her
an eternity of fame. 13 To this ultimate vanity she succumbed; Erasmus
received a substantial gift, and re- covered his eyesight. The custom of
the time forgave a writer for begging aid from patrons, since publishers
were not yet equipped to sustain even widely read authors. Erasmus could
have had benefices, episcopacies, even, later, a cardinal’s hat; he
refused such offers time and again in order to re - main a “free lance,”
intel lectually fetterless. He preferred to beg in freedom rather than
decay in bonds.</p>
<p>In 1502, fleeing plague, Erasmus moved to Louvain. Adrian of
Utrecht,</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) ERASMUS THE FORERUNNER 275</p>
<p>head of the university, offered him a professorship; Erasmus
declined. Re- turning to Paris, he settled down to earn his living by
his pen — one of the earliest modern attempts at that reckless
enterprise. He translated Cicero’s Offices, Euripides’ Hecuba, and
Lucian’s Dialogues. Doubtless this jolly skeptic shared in forming
Erasmus’ mind and style. In 1504 Erasmus wrote to a friend:</p>
<p>Good heavens! with what humor, with what rapidity does Lucian</p>
<p>deal his blows, turning everything to ridicule, and letting
nothing</p>
<p>pass without a touch of mockery. His hardest strokes are aimed at</p>
<p>the philosophers … on account of their supernatural assumptions,</p>
<p>and at the Stoics for their intolerable arrogance. . . . He uses no
less liberty in deriding the gods, whence the surname of atheist was be-
stowed upon him — an honorable distinction coming from the impious and
superstitious. 14</p>
<p>On a second visit to England ( 1 505-06) he joined Colet in a
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury.
Describing this trip under fictitious names in one of his Colloquies, he
told how “Gratian” (Colet) offended their monastic guide by suggesting
that some of the wealth that adorned the cathedral might be used to
alleviate poverty in Canterbury; how the monk showed them milk that had
really come from the Virgin’s breast, and “an amazing quantity of
bones,” all of which had to be kissed reverently; how Gratian balked at
kissing an old shoe that Becket was said to have worn; and how, as a
climactic favor and a sacred souvenir the guide offered Gratian a cloth
allegedly used by the saint to wipe his brow and blow his nose, and
still showing evidences thereof, whereat Gratian grimaced and rebelled.
The two humanists, mourning for humanity, returned to London. 15</p>
<p>Good fortu ne came to Erasmus there. Henry VII’s physician was
sending two sons to Italy; Erasmus was engaged to accompany them as
“general guide and supervisor.” He stayed with the lads at Bologna for a
year, devour - ing the libraries, and adding daily to his fame for
learning, Latinity, and wit. Till this time he had worn the garb of an
Augustinian canon — black robe, mantle, and cowl, and a white hood
usually carried on the arm; now (1506) he discarded these for the less
conspicuous dress of a secular priest, and claimed to have received
permission for this change from Pope Julius II, then in Bologna as a
military conqueror. For reasons unknown to us he re- turned to England
in 1506, and lectured on Greek at Cambridge. But in 1508 we find him
again in Italy — preparing an enlarged edition of his Adagta for the
press of Aldus Manutius in Venice. Passing on to Rome (1509), he was
charmed by the easy life, fine manners, and intellectual cultivation of
the cardinals. He was amused — as Luther, in Rome the year before, had
been shocked — by the inroads that pagan themes and ways had made in the
capital of Christendom. What offended Erasmus more was the martial
policy, ardor,</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>and pursuits of Julius II; there he agreed with Luther; but he agreed
also with rne cardinals, who warmly approved the frequent absences of
the pugnacious Pope. They welcomed Erasmus to their social gatherings,
and offered him some ecclesiastical sinecure if he would settle in
Rome.</p>
<p>Just as he was learning to love the Eternal City, Mountjoy sent him
word that Henry VII had died, that the friend of the humanists had
become Henry VIII, and that all doors and preferments would now be open
to Erasmus if he would come back to England. And along with Mountjoy ’s
letter came</p>
<p>Our acquaintance began when I was a boy. The regard which I then</p>
<p>learned to feel for you has been increased by the honorable mention
you have made of me in your writings, and by the use to which you</p>
<p>have applied your talents in the advancement of Christian truth.
So</p>
<p>far you have borne your burden alone; give me now the pleasure of
assisting and protecting you so far as my power extends. . . . Your</p>
<p>welfare is precious to us all. … I propose therefore that you abandon
all thought of settling elsewhere. Come to England, and assure your-
self of a hearty welcome. You shall name your own terms; they shall be
as liberal and honorable as you please. I recollect that you once said
that when you were tired of wandering you would make this country the
home of your old age. I beseech you, by all that is holy and good, carry
out this promise of yours. We have not now to learn the value of either
your acquirements or your advice. We shall regard your</p>
<p>presence among us as the most precious possession that we have. . . .
You require your leisure for yourself; we shall ask nothing of you</p>
<p>save to make our realm your home. . . . Come to me, therefore, my</p>
<p>dear Erasmus, and let your presence be your answer to my invita-</p>
<p>tion . 16</p>
<p>How could so courteous and generous an invitation be refused? Even if
Rome made him a cardinal, Erasmus’ tongue would be tied; in England,
sur- rounded by influential friends and protected by a powerful king, he
might write more freely and yet be safe. Half reluctantly he bade
farewell to the humanists of Rome, to the great palaces and libraries,
to the cardinals who had favored him. He made his way again over the
Alps, and to Paris, and to England.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE SATIRIST</li>
</ol>
<p>He stayed there five years, and in all that time he received from the
King nothing more than an occasional salutation. Was Henry too busy with
foreign relations or domestic relatives? Erasmus waited and fretted.
Mount- joy came to the rescue with a gift; Warham dowered him with the
revenues</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) ERASMUS THE FORERUNNER 1JJ</p>
<p>of a parish in Kent; and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester and
Chancellor of Cambridge University, appointed him professor of Greek at
£ 13 (,300) a year. To raise this income to the maintenance of a servant
and a horse, Erasmus dedicated his publications to his friends, who
responded ever in- adequately.</p>
<p>In the first year of this third sojourn in England, and in the home
of</p>
<p>Thomas More, Erasmus wrote in seven days his most famous book, The
Praise of Folly . Its Latinized Greek title, Encomium Moriae , was a pun
on More’s name, but moros was Greek for fool, and moria for folly.
Erasmus kept the work in manuscript for two years, then went briefly to
Paris to have it printed (151 1). Forty editions were published in his
lifetime; there were a dozen translations; Rabelais devoured it; as late
as 1632 Milton found it “in everyone’s hand” at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Moria in Erasmus’ use meant not only folly, absurdity, ignorance, and
stupidity, but impulse, instinct, emotion, and unlettered simplicity, as
against wisdom, reason, calculation, intellect. The whole human race, we
are re- minded, owes its existence to folly, for what is so absurd as
the male’s poly - morphous pursuit of the female, his feverish
idealization of her flesh, his goatish passion for copulation? What man
in his senses would pay for such detumescence with the lifelong bondage
of monogamy? What woman in her senses would pay for it with the pains
and tribulations of motherhood? Is it not ridiculous that humanity
should be the accidental by-product of this mutual attrition? If men and
women paused to reason, all would be lost. 17</p>
<p>This illustrates the necessity of folly, and the foolishness of
wisdom. Would bravery exist if reason ruled? 18 Would happiness be
possible? — or was Ecclesiastes right in believing that “he that
increaseth know ledge in- creaseth sorrow, and in much wisdom is much
grief”? Who would be happy if he knew the future? Fortunately science
and philosophy are failures, are ignored by the people, and do no great
damage to the vital ignorance of the race. The astronome rs “will give
you to a hair’s breadth the dimensions of the sun, moon, and stars, as
easily as they would do that of a flagon or a pipkin,” but “nature
laughs at their puny conjectures.” 19 The philosophers confound the
confused and darken the obscure; they lavish time and wit upon logical
and metaphysical subtleties with no result but wind; we should send
them, rather than our soldiers, against the Turks, who would retreat in
terror before such bewildering verbosity. 20 The physicians are no
better; “their whole art as now practiced is one incorporated compound
of im - posture and craft.” 21 As for the theologians, they</p>
<p>will tell you to a tittle all the successive proceedings of
Omnipotence in the creation of the universe; they will explain the
precise manner of original sin being derived from our first parents;
they will satisfy</p>
<p>you as to how . . . our Saviour was conceived in the Virgin’s
womb.</p>
<p>2 7 8</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAR. XIV</p>
<p>and will demonstrate, in the consecrated wafer, how accidents may
subsist without a subject . . . how one body can be in several
places</p>
<p>at the same time, and how Christ’s body in heaven differs from
His</p>
<p>body on the cross or in the sacrament. 22</p>
<p>Think also of the nonsense purveyed as miracles and prodigies —
appari- tions, curative shrines, evocations of Satan, and “such like
bugbears of superstition.”</p>
<p>These absurdities . . . are a good trade, and procure a
comfortable</p>
<p>income to such priests and friars as by this craft get their gain. .
. .</p>
<p>What shall I say of such as cry up and maintain the cheat of pardons
and indulgences? — that by these compute the time of each soul’s resi -
dence in purgatory, and assign them a longer or shorter continuance
according as they purchase more or fewer of these paltry pardons and
saleable exemptions? Or what can be said bad enough of others who
pretend that by the force of such magical charms, or by the fumbling
over their beads in the rehearsal of such and such petitions (which</p>
<p>some religious impostors invented, either for diversion, or, what
is</p>
<p>more likely, for advantage), they shall procure riches, honors,
pleas- ure, long life, and lusty old age, nay, after death, a seat at
the right</p>
<p>hand of the Saviour? 23</p>
<p>The satire runs on at the expense of monks, friars, inquisitors,
cardinals, popes. Monks pester the people with begging, and think to
take heaven by a siege of soporific psalmodies. The secular clergy
hunger and thirst after money; “they are most subtle in the craft of
getting . . . tithes, offerings, perquisites, etc.” 24 All ranks and
varieties of the clergy agree in putting witches to death. The popes
have lost any resemblance to the Apostles in “their riches, honors,
jurisdictions, offices, dispensations, licenses, indul - gences . . .
ceremonies and tithes, excommunications and interdicts,” their lust for
legacies, their worldly diplomacy and bloody wars. 25 How could such a
Church survive except through the folly, the gullible simplicity of
mankind? 26</p>
<p>The Praise of Folly stirred the theologians to an understandable
fury. “You should know,” wrote Martin Dropsius to Erasmus, “that your
Moria has excited a great disturbance even among those who were formerly
your most devoted admirers.” 27 But the satire in this gay devastation
was mild compared to that which marked Erasmus’ next outburst. The third
and final year of his teaching at Cambridge (1513) was the year of Pope
Julius IPs death. In 1 5 14 there appeared in Paris a skit or dialogue
called lulius exclusus. Erasmus made every effort, short of explicit

<p>Holy? . . . Let me look a little closer. Hum! Signs of impiety
aplenty.</p>

<p>you will, I will tell you what you are You are Julius the Emperor</p>
<p>come back from hell. . . .</p>
<p>J: Make an end, or I will excommunicate you. . . .</p>
<p>P: Excommunicate me? By what right, I would know?</p>
<p>J: The best of rights. You are only a priest, perhaps not that —
you</p>
<p>cannot consecrate. Open, I say!</p>
<p>P: You must show your merits first. . . .</p>
<p>J: What do you mean by merits?</p>
<p>P: Have you taught true doctrine?</p>
<p>J: Not 1. 1 have been too busy fighting. There are monks to look</p>
<p>after doctrine, if that is of any consequence.</p>
<p>P: Have you gained souls to Christ by pure example?</p>
<p>/: I have sent a good many to Tartarus.</p>
<p>P: Have you worked any miracles?</p>
<p>J: Pshaw! Miracles are out of date.</p>
<p>P: Have you been diligent in your prayers?</p>
<p>J: The invincible Julius ought not to answer a beggarly
fisherman.</p>
<p>However, you shall know who and what I am. First, I am a
Ligurian,</p>
<p>and not a Jew like you. My mother was a sister of the great Pope</p>
<p>Sixtus IV. The pope made me a rich man out of Church property. I</p>
<p>became a cardinal. I had my misfortunes. I had the French pox. I was
banished, hunted out of my country, but I knew all along that I should
come to be pope. … It came true, partly with French help, partly</p>
<p>with money which I borrowed at interest, partly wi vv * —</p>
<p>Croesus could not have produced all the money that was wanted. The
bankers will tell you about that. But I succeeded. . . . And I have done
more for the Church and Christ than any pope before me.</p>
<p>P: What did you do?</p>
<p>J: I raised the revenue. I invented new offices and sold them. …
I</p>
<p>28 o</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>recoined the currency and made a great sum that way. Nothing can be
done without money. Then I annexed Bologna to the Holy See. . . .</p>
<p>I set all the princes of Europe by the ears. I tore up treaties, and
kept great armies in the field. I covered Rome with palaces, and left
five</p>
<p>millions in the treasury behind me. . . .</p>
<p>P: Why did you take Bologna?</p>
<p>/: Because I wanted the revenue. . . .</p>
<p>P: And how about Ferrara?</p>
<p>/: The duke was an ungrateful wretch. He accused me of simony,</p>
<p>called me a pederast. … I wanted the duchy of Ferrara for a son
of</p>
<p>my own, who could be depended upon to be true to the Church, and who
had just poniarded the Cardinal of Pavia.</p>
<p>P: What? Popes with wives and children?</p>
<p>/: Wives? No, not wives, but why not children? . . .</p>
<p>P: Were you guilty of the crimes of which they accused you?</p>
<p>/: That is nothing to the purpose. . . .</p>
<p>P: Is there no way of removing a wicked pope?</p>
<p>/: Absurd! Who can remove the highest authority of all? … A</p>
<p>pope can be corrected only by a general council, but no general</p>
<p>council can be held without the pope’s consent. . . . Thus he
cannot</p>
<p>be deposed for any crime whatsoever.</p>
<p>P: Not for murder?</p>
<p>/: No, not even if it were parricide.</p>
<p>P: Not for fornication?</p>
<p>/: Not for incest.</p>
<p>P: Not for simony?</p>
<p>/: Not for 600 acts of simony.</p>
<p>P: Not for poisoning?</p>
<p>/: No, nor for sacrilege.</p>
<p>P: Not for all these crimes gathered in a single person?</p>
<p>/: Add 600 more to them, there is no power that can depose the</p>
<p>pope.</p>
<p>P: A novel privilege for my successors — to be the wickedest of</p>
<p>men, yet be safe from punishment. So much the unhappier the Church
that cannot shake such a monster off its shoulders. . . . The people</p>
<p>ought to rise with paving stones and dash such a wretch’s brains</p>
<p>out. … If Satan needed a vicar he could find none fitter than
you.</p>
<p>What sign have you ever shown of an apostle?</p>
<p>J: Is it not apostolic to increase Christ’s Church? . . .</p>
<p>P: How have you increased the Church? . . .</p>
<p>/: I filled Rome with palaces . . . troops of servants, armies,
of-</p>
<p>fices. …</p>
<p>P: The Church had nothing of this when it was founded by</p>

ness’s foot. . . . Lo ok at all this, and tell me, is it not
magnificent? . . . You perceive what a poor wretch of a bishop you are,
compared to me.</p>
<p>P: Insolent wretch! Fraud, usury, and cunning made you pope. . .
.</p>
<p>I brought heathen Rome to acknowledge Christ; you have made it</p>
<p>heathen again. Paul did not talk of the cities he had stormed,
the</p>
<p>legions he had slaughtered … he talked of shipwrecks, bonds, dis-</p>
<p>graces, stripes; these were his apostolic triumphs, these were the
glories of a Christian general. When he boasted it was of the souls he
had</p>
<p>recovered from Satan, not of his piles of ducats. . . .</p>
<p>/: All this is news to me.</p>
<p>P: Very likely. With your treaties and your protocols, your
armies</p>
<p>and your victories, you had no time to read the Gospels. … You</p>
<p>pretend to be a Christian, you are no better than a Turk; you
think</p>
<p>like a Turk, you are as licentious as a Turk. If there is any
difference</p>
<p>you are worse. . . .</p>
<p>/: Then you won’t open the gates?</p>
<p>P: Sooner to anyone else than to such as you. . . .</p>
<p>/: If you don’t give in I will take your place by storm. They are</p>
<p>making fine havoc below just now; I shall soon have 60,000 ghosts</p>
<p>behind me.</p>
<p>P: O wretched man! O miserable Church! … I am not surprised</p>
<p>that so few now apply here for admission, when the Church has such
rulers. Yet there must be good in the world, too, when such a sink</p>
<p>of iniquity can be honored merely because he bears the name of</p>
<p>pope. 29</p>
<p>This, of course, is outrageously one-sided. No such unredeemed rascal
as was here represented could have freed Italy from her invaders,
replaced the old St. Peter’s with the new, discovered, directed, and
developed Michel - angelo and Raphael, united Christian and classic
civilization in the Stanze of the Vatican, and offered to Raphael’s ski
ll that visage of profound thought and exhausting care pictured in the
incomparable portrait of Julius in the Uffizi Gallery. And poor Erasmus,
calling all priests to apostolic poverty while himself importuning his
friends for coin! That a priest should pen so savage an indictment of a
pope reveals the rebellious mood of the time. In 1 5 1 8 — year 2 of
Luther — Peter Gillis wrote to Erasmus from Antwerp: “The</p>
<p>282 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>lulius ex clusus is tor sale everywhere here. Everyone is buying it,
everyone is talking of it.” 30 No wonder the Reformers later reproached
Erasmus for having sounded the tocsin of revolt and then himself
fled.</p>
<p>In 1514 another product of Erasmus’ pen startled the intellectual
world of Western Europe. From 1497 onward he had composed informal
dialogues, professedly to teach Latin style and conversation, but
incidentally discussing a rich variety of lively topics guaranteed to
rouse schoolboys from their daily slumbers. His friend Beatus Rhenanus,
with his permission, published a series of these as F amiliarium
colloquiorum formulae — 1 Forms of Familiar Conver- sations, by Erasmus
of Rotterdam, useful not only for polishing a boy’s speech but for
building his character.” Later editions added more colloquies, so that
they became Erasmus’ most substantial composition.</p>
<p>They are a strange concoction — serious discussions of marriage and
morals, exhortations to piety, exposes of absurdities and abuses in
human conduct and belief, with a sprinkling of pungent or risque jokes —
all in a chatty and idiomatic Latin which must have been harder to write
than the formal lan- guage of learned discourse. An English translator
in 1724 judged “no book fitter to read which does, in so delightful and
instructing a manner, utterly overthrow almost all the Popish Opinions
and Superstitions.” 31 This slightly overstates the point, but certainly
Erasmus, in his gay way, used his “text - book of Latin style” to att
ack again the shortcomings of the clergy. He con- demned
relic-mongering, the misuse of excommunication, the acquisitiveness of
prelates and priests, the false miracles foisted upon the credulous, the
cult of saints for worldly ends, the excesses of fasting, the shocking
contrasts between the Christianity of the Church and the Christianity of
Christ. 32 He made a prostitute praise monks as her most faithful
clients. 33 He warned a young lady who wished to keep her virginity that
she should avoid “those</p>
<p>brawny, swill-bellied monks Chastity is more endangered in the
cloister</p>
<p>than out of it.” 34 He deplored the exaltation of virginity, and sang
a paean to married love as superior to celibacy. He mourned that men so
carefully mated good horses with good, but, in marriages of financial
convenience, wed healthy maids to sickly men; and he proposed to forbid
marriage to syphilitics or persons with any other serious disability or
disease. 35 Mingled with these sober reflections were passages of broad
humor. Boys were ad- vised to salute people when they sneezed, but not
when they “broke wind backward”; 36 and a pregnant woman was hailed with
a unique blessing: “Heaven grant that this burden that you carr y . . .
may have as easy an exit as it had an entrance.” 37 Circumcision was
recommended, “for it moderates the itch of coition.” A long dialogue
between “The Young Man and the Harlot” ended reassuringly with the
lady’s reform.</p>
<p>Critics complained that these colloquies were a very reckless way of
teach- ing Latin style. One alleged that all the youth of Freiburg were
being cor-</p>

punishable with death. Luther here agreed with the Emperor: “On my
deathbed 1 shall forbid my sons to read Erasmus’ Colloquies .” The
furore assured the</p>

<li>THE SCHOLAR</li>
</ol>
<p>He left England in July 1514, and made his way through fog and
customs to Calais. There he received from the prior of his forgotten
monastery at Steyn a letter suggesting that his leave of absence had
long since expired, and that he had better return to spend his remaining
years in repentant piety. He was alarmed, for in canon law the prior
might call upon secular power to drag him back to his cell. Erasmus
excused himself, and the prior did not press the matter; but to avoid a
recurrence of the embarrassment the wander- ing scholar asked his
influential English friends to secure for him, from Leo X, a
dispensation from his obligations as a monk.</p>
<p>While these negotiations were proceeding, Erasmus made his way up the
Rhine to Basel, and offered to Froben the printer the manuscript of his
most important production — a critical revision of the Greek text of the
New Testa- ment, with a new Latin translation and a commentary. It was a
labor of love, pride, and risk for author and publisher alike: the
preparation had taken years, the printing and editing would be laborious
and expensive, the pre- sumption to improve upon Jerome’s Latin version,
long s anctified as the “Vulgate,” might be condemned by the Church, and
the sales would prob - ably fail to meet the costs. Erasmus reduced one
hazard by dedicating the work to Leo X. In February 1516, Froben at last
brought out Novum In- strumentum omne , diligenter ab Erasmo Rot.
recognitum et emendatum. A later edition (1518) changed Instrumentum to
Testamentum. In parallel columns Erasmus presented the Greek text as
revised by him, and his Latin translation. His knowledge of Greek was
imperfect, and he shared with the typesetters the responsibility for
many errors; from the standpoint of scholar- ship this first edition of
the Greek New Testament to be published in print was inferior to that
which a corps of scholars had completed and printed for Cardinal Ximenes
in 1514, but which was not given to the public till</p>

</ol>
<p>Erasmus’ notes were published in a separate volume. They were
written</p>
<p>284 the reformation (chap.xiv</p>
<p>and were widely read. Though generally orthodox, they anticipated
many findings of later research. In his first edition he omitted the
famous Comma Johanneum (I John 5:7), which affirmed the Trinity but is
rejected by the Standard Revised Version today as a fourth-century
interpolation. He printed, but marked as probably spurious, the story of
the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53; 8:11), and the last twelve
verses of the Gospel of Mark. He repeatedly signalized the difference
between primitive and current Christianity. So on Matthew 23:27, he
commented:</p>
<p>What would Jerome say could he see the Virgin’s milk exhibited</p>
<p>for money, with as much honor paid to it as to the consecrated body
of Christ; the miraculous oils; the portions of the true cross, enough,
if collected, to freight a large ship? Here we have the hood of St.</p>
<p>Francis, there our Lady’s petticoat, or St. Anne’s comb . . . not pre
-</p>
<p>sented as innocent aids to religion, but as the substance of
religion</p>
<p>itself — and all through the avarice of priests and the hypocrisy
of</p>
<p>monks playing upon the credulity of the people.</p>
<p>Noting that Matthew 19:12 (“Some have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven’s sake”) was alleged to counsel monastic celibacy,
Erasmus wrote:</p>
<p>In this class we include those who by fraud or intimidation have</p>
<p>been thrust into that life of celibacy where they w r ere allowed
to</p>
<p>fornicate but not to marry; so that if they openly keep a
concubine</p>
<p>they are Christian priests, but if they take a w T ife they are
burned.</p>
<p>In my opinion parents who intend their children for celibate
priest-</p>
<p>hood would be much kinder to castrate them in infancy, rather than to
expose them whole against their will to this temptation to lust. 39</p>
<p>And on I Timothy 3:2:</p>
<p>There are priests now in vast numbers, enormous herds of them,</p>
<p>seculars and regulars, and it is notorious that very few of them
are</p>
<p>chaste. The great proportion fall into lust and incest and open
prof-</p>
<p>ligacy. It would surely be better if those who cannot be
continent</p>
<p>should be allowed lawful wives of their own, and so escape this foul
and miserable pollution. 40</p>
<p>Finally, in a note on Matthew 11:30, Erasmus sounded the basic note
of the Reformers — the return from the Church to Christ:</p>
<p>Truly the yoke of Christ would be sweet, and his burden light, if</p>
<p>petty human institutions added nothing to what he himself imposed. He
commanded us nothing save love for one another, and there is</p>
<p>nothing so bitter that affection does not soften and sweeten it.
Every- thing according to nature is easily borne, and nothing accords
better</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) ERASMUS THE FORERUNNER 285</p>
<p>with the nature of man than the philosophy of Christ, of which
the</p>
<p>sole end is to give back to fallen nature its innocence and
integrity. . . .</p>
<p>The Church added to it many things, of which some can be omitted</p>
<p>without prejudice to the faith … as, for example, all those
philosophic doctrines on . . . the nature of — and the distinction of
persons in — the Deity. . . . What rules, what superstitions, we have
about vestments!</p>
<p>. . . How many fasts are instituted! . . . What shall we say
about</p>
<p>vows . . . about the authority of the pope, the abuse of
absolutions</p>
<p>and dispensations? . . . Would that men were content to let Christ
rule by the laws of the Gospel, and that they would no longer seek
to</p>
<p>strengthen their obscurant tyranny by human decrees! 41</p>
<p>It was probably the notes that carried the book to a success that
must have surprised author and publisher alike. The first edition was
disposed of in three years; new and revised editions were issued in
sixty-nine printings be- fore Erasmus died. Criticism of the work was
vehement; many errors were pointed out; and Dr. Johann Eck, professor at
Ingolstadt and proto-antag- onist of Luther, branded as scandalous
Erasmus’ statement that the Greek of the New Testament was inferior to
that of Demosthenes. Leo X, however, approved the work, and Pope Adrian
VI asked Erasmus to do for the Old Testament what he had done for the
New; but the Council of Trent con- demned Erasmus’ translation, and
pronounced Jerome’s Vulgate the only authentic Latin version of the
Bible. Erasmus’ New Testament was soon superseded as scholarship, but as
an event in the history of thought its in- fluence was immense. It
facilitated and welcomed the vernacular translations that were soon to
follow. Said a fervent passage in the preface:</p>
<p>I would have the weakest woman read the Gospels and the Epistles</p>
<p>of St. Paul I would have those words translated into all
languages,</p>
<p>so that not only Scots and Irishmen, but Turks and Saracens might</p>
<p>read them. I long for the plowboy to sing them to himself as he
fol-</p>
<p>lows the plow, the weaver to hum them to the tune of his shuttle, the
traveler to beguile with them the dullness of his journey. . . .
Other</p>
<p>studies we may regret having undertaken, but happy is the man upon
whom death comes when he is engaged in these. These sacred words give
you the very image of Christ speaking, healing, dying, rising</p>
<p>again, and make him so present, that were he before your very eyes
you would not more truly see him.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in the competence of Froben’s press and staff, Erasmus
issued (November 1 5 1 6) a critical edition of Jerome, and followed it
with similarly revised classical and patristic texts, correcting 4,000
errors in the received text of Seneca; these were substantial services
to scholarship. He retold the story of the New Testament in Paraphrases
(1517). Such tasks required frequent stays in Basel, but a new
attachment fixed his residence near the</p>
<p>286 THE REFORMATION (CHAP.XIV</p>
<p>royal court at Brussels. Charles was at this time only King of
Castile and ruler of the Netherlands, not yet Emperor Charles V. He was
only fifteen, but his keen mind already ranged over diverse interests,
and he was readily per- suaded that his court might enhance its luster
if he included the outs tanding writer of the age among his privy
councilors. It was so ordered; and on re- turning from Basel (1516)
Erasmus accepted the honorary position at a modest salary. He was
offered a canonry at Courtrai, with the promise of a bishopric; he
refused it, remark ing to a friend, “There’s a dream to ’amuse you.” 42
He received and rejected invitations to teach at the universities of
Leipzig and Ingolstadt. Francis I tried to detach him from Charles with
a flattering request that he join the court of France; Erasmus said no
with flowered courtesy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Leo. X had sent to London the solicited dispensations. In
March 1517, Erasmus crossed to London, and received the papal letters
freeing him from his monastic obligations and the disabilities of
bastardy. To the formal documents Leo added a personal note:</p>
<p>Beloved son, health and apostolic benediction. The good favor of</p>
<p>your life and character, your rare erudition and high merits,
witnessed not only by the monuments of your studies, which are
everywhere</p>
<p>celebrated, but also by the general vote of the most learned men, and
commended to us finally by the letters of two most illustrious princes,
the King of England and the Catholic King 〔of France〕, give us
rea-</p>
<p>son to distinguish you with special and singular favor. We have
there- fore willingly granted your request, being ready to declare
more</p>
<p>abundantly our affection for you when you shall either yourself min-
ister occasion, or accident shall furnish it, deeming it right that your
holy industry, assiduously exerted for the public advantage, should</p>
<p>be encouraged to higher endeavors by adequate rewards. 48</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a judicious bribe to good behavior, perhaps an honest
gesture from a tolerant and humanist court; in any case Erasmus never
forgot this papal courtesy, and would always find it hard to .break from
a Church that had so patiently borne the sting of his critique.</p>
<p>V. THE PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>Returning to Brussels, he found himself further seduced to caution by
cordial welcome at the royal court. He took his privy councilorship</p>
<p>seriously, forgetting that brilliant authors are rarely equipped for
states- manship. In the busy year 1516 he composed in haste an
Institutio principis Christiani (Education of a Christian Prince ), rich
in pre-Machiavellian plati- tudes of how a king should behave. In the
dedication to Charles he wrote</p>
<p>CHAP.XIv) ERASMUS THE FORERUNNER 287</p>
<p>with bold directness: “You owe it to Providence tha t your realm has
been acquired without injury to any; your wisdom will be best shown if
you can keep it in peace and tranquillity.” 44 Like most philosophers,
Erasmus reckoned monarchy the least evil form of government; he feared
the people as a “fickl e, many- headed monster,” deprecated the popular
discussion of laws and politics, and judged the chaos of revolution
worse than the tyranny of kings. 45 But he counseled his Christian
prince to guard against the con- centration of wealth. Taxes should fall
only upon luxuries. There should be fewer monasteries, more schools.
Above all, there should be no war among Christian states — nor even
against the Turks. “We shall better overcome the Turks by the piety of
our lives than by arms; the empire of Christianity will thus be defended
by the same means by which it was originally estab- lished.” 46 “What
does war beget except war?— but civility invites civility, justice
invites justice.” 47</p>
<p>As Charles and Francis edged toward hostilities, Erasmus made appeal
after appeal for peace. He complimented the French King on a passing
mood of conciliation, and asked how anyone could think of waging war
with France, “the purest and most flourishing part of Christendom.” 48
In Querela pacts ( The Complaint of Peace, 1517) he reached his peak of
passionate eloquence:</p>
<p>I pass silently over the tragedies of ancient wars. I will stress
only</p>
<p>those which have taken place in the course of these last years. Where
is the land or sea where people have not fought in the most cruel man-
ner? Where is the river that has not been dyed with human blood . . .
with Christian blood? O supreme shame! They behave more cruelly</p>
<p>in battle than non-Christians, more savagely than wild beasts. . . .
All 〔these wars〕 were undertaken at the caprice of princes, to the
great detriment of the people, whom these conflicts in no way
concerned.</p>
<p>. . . Bishops, cardinals, popes who are vicars of Christ — none among
them is ashamed to start the war that Jesus so execrated. What is there
in common between the helmet and the miter? . . . Bishops, how dare you,
who hold the place of the Apostles, teach people things that</p>
<p>touch on war at the same time that you teach the precepts of the</p>
<p>Apostles? . . . There is no peace, even unjust, ’which is not
preferable to the most just of wars .* 9</p>
<p>Princes and generals may profit from war, but the masses bear the
tragedies and the costs. 60 It may sometimes be necessary to fight a war
of self-defense, but even in such cases it may be wiser to buy off the
enemy than to wage war. 61 Let the kings submit their disputes to the
pope. This would have been impracticable under Ju lius II, himself a
warrior; but Leo X, “a learned, honest, and pious pontiff,” might
arbitrate with justice, and preside effec - tively over an international
court. 62 Erasmus called nationalism a curse to</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>humani ty, and challenged statesmen to forge a universal state. “I
wish,” he said, “to be called a citizen of the world .” 68 He forgave
Bude for loving France, but “in my opinion it is more philosophical to
put our relations with things and men on such a footing as to treat the
world as the common country of us all .” 64 Erasmus was the least
national spirit in the rising nationalism of the Reformation age. “The
most sublime thing,” he wrote, “is to deserve well of the human race .”
86</p>
<p>We must not look to Erasmus for any realistic conception of human na-
ture, or of the causes of war, or of the behavior of states. He never
faced the problem that Machiavelli was dealing with in those same years
— whether a state can survive if it practices the morality that it
preaches to its citizens. The function of Erasmus was to cut dead
branches from the tree of life rather than to construct a positive and
consistent philosophy. He was not even sure that he was a Christian. He
frequently professe d to accept the Apostles’ Creed; yet he must have
doubted hell, for he wrote that “they are not as impious who deny the
existence of God as are those who picture Him as in- exorable.” 88 He
could hardly have believed in the divine authorship of the Old
Testament, for he averred his willingness to “see the whole Old Testa -
ment abolished” if that would quiet the furore raised over Reuchlin . 87
He smiled at the traditions that Minos and Numa persuaded their peoples
to obey uncongenial legislation by fathering it upon the gods , 58 and
probably suspected Moses of similar statesmanship. He expressed surprise
that More was satisfied with the arguments for personal immortality . 59
He thought of the Eucharist as a symbol rather than a miracle ; 60 he
obviously doubted the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Virgin Birth;
and More had to defend him from a correspondent who declared that
Erasmus had privately con- fessed his unbelief . 81 He called in
question one after another of the Christian usages of his time —
indulgences, fasting, pilgrimages, auricular confession, monasticism,
clerical celibacy, relic worship, prayers to the saints, the burn- ing
of heretics. He gave allegorical or rational explanations of many
Biblical passages; he compared the story of Adam and Eve with that of
Prometheus, and advised “the least literal” interpretation of the
Scriptures . 82 He resolved the pains of hell into “the perpetual
anguish of mind that accompanies habit - ual sin.” 68 He did not
broadcast his doubts a mong the people, for he had no comforting or
deterrent myths to offer in place of the old ones. “Piety,” he wrote,
“requires that we should sometimes conceal truth, that we should take
care not to show it always, as if it did not matter when, where, or to
whom we show it. . . . Perhaps we must admit with Plato that lies are
useful to the people.” 64</p>
<p>Despite this strong bent toward rationalism, Erasmus remained
externally orthodox. He never lost his affection for Christ, for the
Gospels, and for</p>

<p>289</p>
<p>the symbolic ceremonies with which the Church promoted piety. He made
a character in the Colloquies say: “If anything is in common use with
Chris- tians that is not repugnant to the Holy Scriptures, I observe it
for this reason, that I may not offend other people.” 65 He dreamed of
replacing theology with “the philosophy of Christ,” and strove to
harmonize this with the thought of the greater pagans. He applied to
Plato, Cicero, and Seneca the phrase, “divinely inspired”; 66 he would
not admit that such men were ex - cluded from salvation; and he could
“scarce forbear” praying to “Saint Socrates.” He asked the Church to
reduce the essential dogmas of Chris - tianity to as “few as possible,
leaving opinion free on the rest.” 67 He did not advocate the full
tolerance of all opinions (who does?), but he favored a lenient attitude
toward religious heresy. His ideal of religion was the imi- tation of
Christ; we must admit, however, that his own practice was less than
evangelical.</p>

<p>How, actually, did he live? At this time (1517) he resided for the
most part in Flanders — at Brussels, Antwerp, and Louvain. He dwelt in
celibate privacy with one servant, but often accepted the hospitality of
the prosper- ous, who courted his company as a social distinction and an
intellectual feast. His tastes were fastidious; his nerves and feelings
were refined to the point of frequent suffering from the vigorous
vulgarities of life. He drank wine abundantly, and prided himself on his
ability to carry it steadily. It may have been part cause of the gout
and stones that galled him, but he thought it relieved his pain by
dilating his arteries. In 1514, aged forty-five or forty- eight, he
described himself as “a gray -headed invalid . . . who must drink
nothing but wine,” and must “be nice in what he eats.” 68 Fasting
disagreed with him, and he fumed against fish; perhaps his bile colored
his theology. He slept poorly, like most people whose busy brains
recognize no curfew. He consoled himself with friends and books. “I seem
deprived of myself when I am shut out from my usual habits of study. . .
. My home is where I have my library.” 69</p>
<p>It was partly to buy books that he solicited money with all the
assiduity of a parish priest. He received regular pensions from Mountjoy
and War- ham, substantial gifts like the 300 florins (,500?) from Jean
le Sauvage, Chancellor of Burgundy, and royalties exceeding those earned
by any other author of his time. He disclaimed any love of money; he
sought it because, as a man without moorings, he feared the insecurity
of a lonely old age. Meanwhile he continued to refuse lucrative posts
that would have extended his income at the cost of his f reedom.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>His appearance was at first unimpressive. He was short, thin, pale,
weak in voice and constitution. He impressed by his sensitive hands, his
long, sharp nose, his blue-gray eyes flashing with wit, and his speech —
the conversation of the richest and quickest mind of that brilliant age.
The greatest artists among his northern contemporaries were eager to
paint his portrait, and he consented to sit for them because such
portraits were welcomed as gifts by his friends. Quentin ’Massys
pictured him in 1 5 1 7 — absorbed in writing, bundled in a heavy coat
as protection against the chilly rooms of those cen- turies; this was
presented to More. Diirer made a charcoal drawing of Eras- mus in 1520,
and a remarkable engraving in 1526; here the German touch gave the “good
European” a thoroughly Dutch physiognomy; “if I look like that,” said
the sitter, “I am a great knave.” 70 Holbein surpassed all these efforts
in the many portraits that he made of Erasmus. One is in Turin, an-
other in England, a third in Basel, the best in the Louvre — all
masterly per- formances by the greatest portrait painter in the north.
Here the scholar has become a philosopher, quiet, meditative, somewhat
melancholy, re- luctantly resigned to the careless neutrality of nature
and the mortality of genius. “What our lot brings must be borne,” he
wrote in 1517, “and I have composed my mind for every event” 71 — a
Stoic ataraxia that he never really achieved. “He loves glory,” he said
of an ambitious youth, “but he does not know what a weight glory is”; 72
yet Erasmus, like many a noble soul, labored night and day to win that
incubus.</p>
<p>His faults leaped to the eye; his virtues were secrets known only to
his intimates. He could beg shamelessly, but he could also give, and
many a ris- ing spirit expanded in the warmth of his praise. When
Reuchlin was assailed by Pfefferkorn, Erasmus wrote to his friends among
the cardinals at Rome, and helped to win protection for the harassed
Hebraist. He lacked modesty and gratitude, which came hard to one
courted by popes and kings. He was impatient and resentful of criticism,
73 and sometimes answered it in the abusive manner of that polemic age.
He shared the anti-Semitism of even the scholars of the Renaissance. His
interests were as narrow as they were in- tense: he loved literature
when it clothed philosophy, and philosophy when it left logic for life,
but he almost ignored science, scenery, music, and art. He smiled at the
systems of astronomy that then strutted the stage, and the stars smiled
with him. In all his multitudinous correspondence there is no
appreciation of the Alps, or the architecture of Oxford and Cambridge,
or the painting of Raphael or the sculpture of Michelangelo, who were
working for Julius II when Erasmus was in Rome (1509); and the lusty
singing of the Reformed congregations would later offend his educated
ears. His sense of humor was usually subtle and refined, occasionally
Rabelaisian, often sarcastic, once inhuman, as when he wrote to a
friend, on hearing that some</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) ERASMUS THE F ORERUNNER 29I</p>
<p>heretics had been burned, “I would pity them the less if they raise
the price of fuel now that winter is coming on.” 74 He had not only the
natural egoism or selfishness of all men, but also that secret and
cherished egotism, or self- conceit, without which the writer or artist
would be crushed in the ruthless rush of an indifferent world. He loved
flattery, and agreed with it despite frequent disclaimers. “Good
judges,” he told a friend, “say that I write better</p>
<p>It was true, though only in Latin. He wrote bad French, spoke a
little Dutch and English, “tasted Hebrew only with the tip of the
tongue,” 76 and knew Greek imperfectly; but he mastered Latin
thoroughly, and handled it as a living tongue applicable to the most
un-Latin nuances and trivia of his time. A century newly enamored of the
classics forgave most of his faults for the lively brilliance of his
style, the novel charm of his understatements, the bright dagger of his
irony. His letters rival Cicero’s in elegance and</p>
<p>No other contemporary writer equaled his fame, unless we think of
Luther as a writer. One Oxford bookseller reported in 1520 that a third
of all his sales were of works by Erasmus. He had many enemies,
especially among the theologians of Louvain, but he had disciples in a
dozen universities, and humanists throughout Europe hailed him as their
exemplar and chief. In the field of literature he was the Renaissance
and humanism embodied — their cult of the classics and a polished Latin
style, their gentlemen’s agreement not to break with the Church, and not
to disturb the inevitable mythology of the masses, provided the Church
winked at the intellectual freedom of the educated classes and permitted
an orderly, internal reform of ecclesiastical abuses and absurdities.
Erasmus, like all humanists, was heartened by the elevation of Leo X to
the papacy; their dream had come true — a humanist, a scholar, and a
gentleman, the living unification of the Renaissance and Chris- tianity,
had mounted the greatest of thrones. Surely now a peaceful cleans- ing
of the Church would come; education would spread; the people would</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>(chap. XIV</p>
<p>keep their lovely ritual and consolatory faith, but the human mind
would be free. 79</p>
<p>Almost to the brink of Luther Erasmus kept that hope. But on
September 9, 1517, he wrote from Antwerp to Thomas, Cardinal of York, an
ominous line: “In this part of the world I am afraid a great revolution
is impending.” 80 In less than two months it came.</p>
