<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>The Conflict of Philosophy</p>
<p>and Religion</p>
<p>I. THE IDEALISTS</p>
<p>T he age of Pericles resembled our own in the variety and disorder of
its thought, and in the challenge that it offered to every
traditional</p>
<p>standard and belief. But no age has ever rivaled that of Pericles in
the num- ber and grandeur of its philosophical ideas, or in the vigor
and exuberance with which they were debated. Every issue that agitates
the world today was bruited about in ancient Athens, and with such
freedom and eagerness that all Greece except its youth was alarmed. Many
cities — above all, Sparta —forbade the public consideration of
philosophical problems, “on account of the jealousy and strife and
profitless discussions” (says Athenaeus) “to which they gi ve rise.’”
But in Periclean Athens the “dear delight” of</p>
<p>philosophy captured the imagination of the educated classes; rich men
opened their homes and salons in the manner of the French Enlighten-
ment; philosophers were lionized, and clever arguments were applauded
like sturdy blows at the Olympic games.* When, in 432, a war of swords
was added to the war of words, the excitement of the Athenian mind be-
came a fever in which all soberness of thought and judgment was
consumed. The fever subsided for a time after the martyrdom of Socrates,
or was dissipated from Athens to other centers of Greek life; even
Plato, who had known the very height and crisis of it, became exhausted
after sixty years of the new game, and envied Egypt the inviolable
orthodoxy and quiet stability of its thought. No age until the
Renaissance would know such enthusiasm again.</p>
<p>Plato was the culmination of a development that began with
Parmenides; he played Hegel to Parmenides’ Kant; and though he scattered
condemna - tion lavishly, he never ceased to reverence his metaphysical
father. In the little town of Elea, on the western coast of Italy, 450
years before Christ, there began for Europe that philosophy of idealism
which was to wage</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>through every subsequent century an obstinate war against
materialism.* The mysterious problem of knowledge, the distinction
between noumenon and phenomenon, between the unseen real and the unreal
seen, was flung into the caldron of European thought, and was to boil or
simmer there through Greek and medieval days until, in Kant, it would
explode again in a philosophical revolution.</p>
<p>As Kant was “awakened” by Hume, so Parmenides was aroused to</p>
<p>philosophy by Xenophanes; perhaps his was one of many minds stirred
by Xenophanes’ declaration that the gods were myths, and that there was
only one reality, which was both world and God. Parmenides studied with
the Pythagoreans also, and absorbed something of their passion for
astronomy. But he did not lose himself in the stars. Like most Greek
philosophers he was interested in living affairs and the state; Elea
commissioned him to draw up for it a code of laws, which it hked so well
that its magistrates were thenceforth required to decide al l cases by
that code.’ Possibly as a recrea - tional aside in a busy life he
composed a philosophical poem On Nature, of which some i6o verses
survive, enough to make us regret that Par- menides did not write prose.
The poet announces, with a twinkle in ’his eye, that a goddess has
delivered to him a revelation: that all things are one; that motion,
change, and development are unreal — phantasms of superficial,
contradictory, untrustworthy sense; that beneath these mere appearances
lies an unchanging, homogeneous, indivisible, indissoluble, motionless
unity, which is the only Being, the only Truth, and the only God.
Heracleitus said, Fanta ret, all things change; Parmenides says. Hen ta
panta, all things are one, and never change. At times, hke Xenophanes,
he speaks of this One as the universe, and calls it spheroidal and
finite; at times, in an idealis - tic vision, he identifies Being with
Thought, and sings, “One thing are T hinkin g and Being,”* as if to say
that for us things exist only in so f ar as we are conscious of them.
Beginning and end, birth and death, forma- tion and destruction, are of
forms only; the One Real never begins and never ends; there is no
Becoming, there is only Being. Motion, too, is un- real, it assumes the
passage of something from where it is to where there is nothing, or
empty space; but empty space. Not Being, cannot be; there is no void;
the One ffls every nook and cranny of the world, and is forever at
rest.t</p>
<p>• The Hindus had seen the problem long before, an d were to remain
Parmenideans to the end; perhaps the antisensationism of the Upanishads
had penetrated through Ionia or Pythagoras to Parmenides.</p>
<p>t This strains the imagination; but almost in Parmenidean fashion we
speak of a table as at rest though it is composed (we are told) of the
most excitably mobile “electrons.” Par - menides saw the world as we see
the table; the electron would see the table as we see the world.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 351</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that men would listen patiently to all
this; and apparently the Parmenidean Rest became the target of a
thousand metaphysical assaults. The significance of Parmenides’ subtle
follower, Zeno of Elea, lay in an attempt to show that the ideas of
plurality and mo- tion were, at least theoretically, as impossible as
Parmenides’ motionless One. As an exercise in perversity, and to amuse
his youth, Zeno published a book of paradoxes, of which nine have come
down to us, and of which three will suffice. First, said Zeno, any body,
in order to move to point A, must reach B, the middle of its course
toward A; to arrive at B it must reach C, the middle of its course
toward B; and so on to infinity. Since an infinity of time would be
required for this infinite series of motions, the motion of any body to
any point is impossible in a finite time. Second, as a variant of the
first, swift-footed Achilles can never overtake the leisurely tortoise;
for as often as Achilles reaches the point which the tortoise occupied,
in that same moment the tortoise has moved beyond that point. Third, a
fly- ing arrow is really at rest; for at any moment of its flight it is
at only one point in space, that is, is motionless; its motion, however
actual to the senses, is logically, metaphysically unreal.*’</p>
<p>Zeno came to Athens about 450, perhaps with Parmenides, and set the
impressionable city astir by his skill in reducing any kind of
philosophical theory to absurd consequences. Timon of Phlius
described</p>
<p>The two-edged tongue of mighty Zeno, who.</p>
<p>Say what one would, would argue it untrue.*</p>
<p>This pre-Socratic gadfly was (in the relative sense which our
ignorance of the past compels us to give to such phrases) the father of
logic, as Par- menides was for Europe the father of metaphysics.
Socrates, who de- nounced Zeno’s dialectical method,’ imitated it so
zealously that men had to kill him in order to have peace of mind.
Zeno’s influence upon the skeptical Sophists was decisive, and in the
end it was his skepticism that triumphed in Pyrrho and Cameades. In his
old age, having become a man “of great wisdom and learning,’”“ he
complained that the philosophers had taken too seriously the
intellectual pranks of his youth. His final escapade was more fatal to
him: he joined in an attempt to depose the tyrant Nearches at Elea, was
foiled and arrested, tortured and killed.” He bore his suffer - ings
bravely, as if to associate his name so soon with the Stoic
philosophy.</p>
<p>• The discussion of these paradoxes has gone on from Plato® to
Bertrand Russell ’ and may continue as long as words are mistaken for
things. The assumptions that invalidate the puzzles are that “infinite”
is a thing instead of merely a word indicating the inability of the mind
to</p>

<li>THE MATERIALISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>As Parmenides’ denial of motion and change was a reaction against the
fluid and unstable metaphysics of Hercleitus, so his monism was a
counter- blast to the atomism of the later Pythagoreans. For these had
developed the number theory of their founder into the doctrine that all
things are com- posed of numbers in the sense of indivisible units.”
When Philolaus of Thebes added that “all things take place by necessity
and by harmony,”” everything was ready for the Atomic school in Greek
philosophy.</p>
<p>About 435 Leucippus of Miletus came to Elea, and studied under Zeno;
there, perhaps, he heard of the number atomism of the Pythagoreans, for
Zeno had aimed some of his subtlest paradoxes at this doctrine of
plurality.” Leucippus finally settled in Abdera, a flourishing Ionian
colony in Thrace. Of his direct teaching only one fragment remains:
“Nothing happens without a reason, but all things occur for a reason,
and of necessity.”” Presumably it was in answer to Zeno and Parmenides
that Leucippus de- veloped the notion of the void, or empty space; in
this way he hoped to make motion theoretically possible as well as
sensibly actual. The uni- verse, said Leucippus, contains atoms and
space and nothing else. Atoms tumbling about in a vortex fall by
necessity into the first forms of all things, like attaching itself to
like ; in this way arose the planets and the stars.” All things, even
the human soul, are composed of atoms.</p>
<p>Democritus was the pupil or associate of Leucippus in developing the
atomistic philosophy into a rounded system of materialism. His father
was a ma n of wealth and position in Abdera;” from him, we are told,
Democritus inherited a hundred talents (00,000), most of which he spent
in travel.” Unconfirmed stories send him as far as Egypt and Ethiopia,
Babylonia, Persia, and India.” “Among my contemporaries,” he says, “I
have traveled over the largest portion of the earth in search of things
the most remote, and have seen the most climates and countries, and
heard the largest number of thinkers.”*” At Boeotian Thebes he stopped
long enough to imbib e the number atomism of Philolaus.” Having spent
his money he became</p>
<p>• “To die wise and good man,” he writes, “the whole earth is his
fatherland.”“</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 353</p>
<p>Diogenes Laertius gives a long list of his publications in
mathematics, physics, astronomy, navigation, geography, anatomy,
physiology, psychol- ogy, psychotherapy, medicine, philosophy, music,
and art.* Thrasyllus called him pentathlos in philosophy, and some
contemporaries gave him the very name of Wisdom (sophia).“ His range was
as wide as Anstotle’s, his style as highly praised as Plato’s.“ Francis
Bacon, in no perverse mo - ment, called him the greatest of ancient
philosophers.“</p>
<p>He begins, like Parmenides, with a critique of the senses. For
practical purposes we may trust them; but the moment we begin to analyze
their evidence we find ourselves taking away from the external world
layer after layer of the color, temperature, flavor, savor, sweetness,
bitterness, and sound that the senses lay upon it; these “secondary
qualities” are in our - selves or in the total process of perception,
not in the objective thing; in an earless world a falling forest would
make no noise, and the ocean, however angry, would never roar. “By
convention (nomos) sweet is</p>
<p>sweet, bitter is bitter, hot is hot, cold is cold, color is color;
but in trudi there are only atoms and the void.”* Hence the sense s give
us only obscure knowledge, or opinion; genuine knowledge comes only by
investigation and thought. “Verily, we know nothing. Truth is buried
deep. . . . We know nothing for certain, but only the changes produced
in our body by the forces that imp inge upon it.”“ All sensations are
due to atoms dis - charged by the object and falling upon our sense
organs.” All senses are forms of touch.“</p>
<p>The atoms that constitute the world differ in figure, size, and
weight; all have a tendency downward; in the resultant rotatory motion
like atoms combine with like and produce the planets and the stars. No
rumsy or in- telligence, guides the atoms, no Empedoclean “love” or
“hate” assorts them, but necessity — the natural operation of inherent
causes — rules over all.“ There is no chance; chance is a fiction
invented to disguise our</p>
<p>ignorance.“ The quantity of matter remains always the same; none is
ever created, none ever destroyed;“ only the atom combinations change.
Forms, however, are innumerable; even of worlds there is probably an
“infinite” number, coming into being and passing away in an interminable
pageantry.“ Organic beings arose originally from the moist earth.“
Every- thing in man is made of atoms; the soul is composed of tiny,
smooth, round atoms, like those of fire. Mind, soul, vital heat, vital
principle, are all one and the same thing; they are not confined to men
or animals, but are</p>
<p>354 the life of Greece (chap.xvi</p>
<p>diffused throughout the world; and in man and other animals the
mental atoms whereby we think are distributed throughout the body.*”</p>
<p>Nevertheless these fine atoms that constitute the soul are the
noblest and most wonderful part of the body. The wise man will cultivate
thought, will free himself from passion, superstition, and fear, and
will seek in con- templation and understanding the modest happiness
available to human life. Happiness does not come from external goods; a
man “must become</p>
<p>He illustrated his own precepts, and perhaps justified his counsels,
by living to the age of a hundred and nine, or, as some say, to merely
ninety, years.“ Diogenes Laertius relates that when Democritus read in
public his most important work, the vtegas diakosvtos, or Great World,
the city of Abdera presented him with a hundred talents (00,000) ; but
perhaps Ab- dera had depreciated its currency. When someone asked the
secret of his longevity, he answered that he ate honey daily, and bathed
his body with oil.“ Finally, having lived long enough, he reduced his
food each day, de- cermined to starve himself by easy degrees.“ “He was
exceedingly old,” says Diogenes,”</p>
<p>and appeared to be at the point of death. His sister lamented
that</p>
<p>he would die during the festival of the Thesmophoria, which would</p>
<p>prevent her from discharging her duties to the goddess. So he
bade</p>
<p>her be of good cheer, and to bring him hot loaves (or a little
honey”) every day. And by applying these to his nostrils he kept
himself</p>
<p>• Lucretius attributes a kind of psychophysical parallelism to “the
great Democritus,” who laid it down that the atoms of body and the atoms
of mind are placed one beside one tfitemately in pairs, and so link the
frame together.”^</p>
<p>355</p>

<p>alive over the festival. But when the three days of the feast
were</p>
<p>passed he expired without any pain, as Hipparchus assures us,
hav-</p>
<p>ing lived one hundred and nine years.</p>
<p>His city gave him a public funeral, and Timon of Athens praised him.“
He founded no school; but he formulated for science its most famous hy-
pothesis, and gave to philosophy a system which, denounced by every
other, has survived them aU, and reappears in every generation.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>EMPEDOCLES</li>
</ol>
<p>Idealism offends the senses, materialism offends the soul; the one
explains everything but the world, the other everything but life. To
merge these half-truths it was necessary to find some dynamic principle
that could medi- ate between structure and growth, between things and
thought. Anaxagoras sought such a principle in a cosmic Mind; Empedocles
sought it in the inherent forces that made for evolution.</p>
<p>This Leonardo of Acragas was bom in the year of Marathon, of a
wealthy family whose passion for horse racing gave no promise of
philosophy. He studied for a while with the Pythagoreans, but in his
exuberance he divulged some of their esoteric doctrine, and was
expelled.“ He took very much to heart the notion of transmigration, and
announced with poetic sympathy that he had been “in bygone times a
youth, a maiden, and a flowering shrab; a bird, yes, and a fish that
swims in silence through the deep sea.”“ He condemned the eating of
animal food as a form of canni - balism; for were not these animals the
reincarnation of human beings?“ All men, he believed, had once been
gods, but had forfeited their heavenly place by some impurity or
violence; and he was certain that he felt in his own soul intimations of
a prenatal divinity. “From what glory, from what immeasurable bliss,
have I now sunk to roam with mortals on this earth!”“ Convinced of his
divine origin, he put golden sandals upon his feet, clothed his body
with purple robes, and crowned his head with laurel; he was, as he
modestly explained to his countrymen, a favorite of ApoUo; only to his
friends id he confess that he was a god. He claimed supernatural pow-
ers, performed magic rites, and sought by incantations to wrest from the
other world the secrets of human destiny. He offered to cure diseases by
the enchantment of his words, and cured so many that the populace half
believed his claims. Actually he was a learned physician fertile in sug-
gestions to medical science, and skilled in the psychology of the
medical</p>

<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>art. He was a brilliant orat or; he “invented,” says Aristotle,“ the
principles of rhetoric, and taught them to Gorgias, who peddled them in
Athens. Hfe was an engineer who freed Selinus from pestilence by
draining marshes and changing the courses of streams.® He was a
courageous statesman who, though himself an aristocrat, led a popular
revolution against a narrow aristocracy, refused the dictatorship, and
established a moderate democ- racy.® He was a poet, and wrote On Nature
and On Purifications in such excellent verse that Aristotle and Cicero
ranked him high among the poets, and Lucretius complimented him with
imitation. “When he went to the Olympic games,” says Diogenes Laertius,
“he was the object of general attention, so that there was no mention
made of anybody else in com- parison with him.”“ Perhaps, after all, he
was a god.</p>
<p>The 470 lines that survive give us only hazardous intimations of
his</p>
<p>philosophy. He was an eclectic, and saw some wisdom in every system.
He deprecated Parmenides’ wholesale rejection of the senses, and
welcomed each sense as an “avenue to understanding.”® Sensation is due
to effluxes of particles proceeding from the object and falling upon the
“pores” (poroi) of the senses; therefore light needs time to come from
the sun to us.® Night is caused by the earth intercepting the rays of
the sun.® All things are com- posed of four elements — air, lire, water,
and earth. Operating upon these are two basic forces, attraction and
repulsion. Love and Hate. The end- less combinations and separations of
the elements by these forces produce the world of things and history.
WTien Love or the tendency to combine is dominant, matter develops into
plants, and organisms take higher and higher forms. Just as
transmigration weaves all souls into one biography, so in nature there
is no sharp distinction between one species or genus and another; e.g.,
“Hair and leaves and the thick feathers of birds, and the scales that
form on tough limbs, are the same thing.”® Nature produces every kind of
organ and form; Love unites them, sometimes into monstrosi- ties that
perish through maladaptation, sometimes into organisms capable of
propagating themselves and meeting the conditions of survival.® All
higher forms develop from lower forms.” At first both sexes are in the
same body; then they become separated, and each longs to be reunited
with the other.*“ To this process of evolution corresponds a process of
dissolution, in which Hate, or the force of division, tears down the
com- plex structure that Love has built. Slowly organisms and planets
revert to more and more primitive forms, until all things are merged
again in a</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps Plato poached here for Aristophanes’ speech in the
Symposium,</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 357</p>
<p>primeval and amorphous mass.” These alternating processes of develop
- ment and decay go on endlessly, in each part and in the whole; the two
forces of combination and separation, Love and Hate, Good and Evil,
fight and balance each other in a vast universal rhythm of Life and
Death. So old is the philosophy of Herbert Spencer.“</p>
<p>The place of God in this process is not clear, for in Empedocles it
is</p>
<p>difiicult to separate fact from metaphor, philosophy from poetry.
Some- times he identifies deity with the cosmic sphere itself, sometimes
with the life of all life, or the mind of all mind; but he knows that we
shall never be able to form a just idea of the basic and original
creative power. “We cannot bring God near so as to reach him with our
eyes and lay hold of him with our hands. . . . For he has no human head
attached to bodily members, nor do two branching arms dangle from his
shoulders; he has neither feet nor knees nor any hairy parts. No; he is
only mind, sacred and ineffable mind, flashin g through the whole
universe with swift thoughts.”” And Empedocles concludes with the wise
and weary counsel of old age:</p>
<p>Weak and narrow are the powers implanted in the limbs of men;</p>
<p>many the woes that fall on them and blunt the edge of thought;</p>
<p>short is the measure of the life in death through which they
toil.</p>
<p>Then are they home away; like smoke they vanish into air; and</p>
<p>what they dream they know is but the little that each hath stumbled
upon in wandering about the world. Yet boast they all that they</p>
<p>have learned the whole. Vain fools! For what that is, no eye hadi</p>

<p>In his last years he became more distinctly a preacher and prophet,
ab- sorbed in the theory of reincarnation, and imploring his fellow men
to purge away the guilt that had exiled them from heaven. With the
assorted wisdom of Buddha, Pythagoras, and Schopenhauer he warned the
human race to abstain from marriage, procreation,” and beans.“ When, in
415, the Athenians besieged Syracuse, Empedocles did what he could to
help its resistance, and thereby offended Acragas, which hated Syracuse
with all the animosity of kinship. Banished from his native city, he
went to the mainland of Greece and died, some say, in M egara.” But
Hippobotus, says Diogenes Laertius,” tells how Empedocles, after
bringing back to full life a woman who had been given up for dead, rose
from the feast that cele- brated her recovery, disappeared, and was
never seen again. Legend said that he had leaped into Etna’s fiery mouth
so that he might die without leaving a trace behind him, and thereby
confirm his divinity. But the</p>

<li>THE SOPHISTS</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a reproof to those who think of Greece as synonymous with
Athens, that none of the great Hellenic thinkers before Socrates
belonged to that city, and only Plato after him. The fate of Anaxagoras
and Socrates indi- cates that religious conservatism was stronger in
Athens than in the col- onies, where geographical separation had broken
some of the bonds of tradition. Perhaps Athens would have remained
obscurantist and intolerant to the point of stupidity had it not been
for the growth of a cosmopolitan trading class, and the coming of the
Sophists to Athens.</p>
<p>The debates in the Assembly, the trials before the heliaea, and the
rising need for the ability to think with the appearance of logic and to
speak with clarity and persuasion, conspired with the wealth and
curiosity of an imperial society to create a demand for something
unknown in Athens before Pericles — formal higher education in letters,
oratory, science, philos- ophy, and statesmanship. The demand was met at
first not by the organi- zation of universities but by wandering
scholars who engaged lecture halls, gave there their courses of
instruction, and then passed on to other cities to repeat them. Some of
these men, like Protagoras, called themselves sophistai —iA., teachers
of wisdom.” The word was accepted as equivalent to our “university
professor,” and bore no derogatory connotation until the conflict
between religion and philosophy led to conservative attacks upon the
Sophists, and the commercialism of certain of them provoked Plato to
darken their name with the imputations of venal sophistry that now cling
to it. Perhaps the general public entertained a vague dislike for these
teachers from their first appearance, since their costly instruction in
logic and rhetoric could be bought only by the well to do, and gave
these an advantage in trying their cases before the courts.“ It is true
that the more famous Sophists, like most skilled practitioners in any
field, charged all that their patrons could be persuaded to pay; this is
the final law of prices everywhere. Protagoras and Gorgias, we are told,
demanded ten thousand drachmas (0,000) for the education of a single
pupil. But lesser Sophists were content vdth reasonably moderate fees;
Prodicus, famous through- out Greece, asked from one to fifty drachmas
for admission to his courses.“ Protagoras, the most renowned of the
Sophists, was bom in Abdera a</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 359</p>
<p>generation before Democritus. In his lifetime he was the better known
of the two, and the more influential; we surmise his repute from the
furore created by his visits to Athens.<em>“ Even Plato, who was not
often intention- ally fair to the Sophists, respected him, and described
him as a man of high character. In the Platonic dialogue that is named
after him Protagoras makes a much better showing than the argumentative
young Socrates; here it is Socrates who talks like a Sophist, and
Protagoras who behaves like a gentleman and a philosopher, never losing
his temper, never jealous of another’s brilli &lt;nce, never taking the
argument too seriously, and never anxious to speak. He admits that he
undertakes to teach his pupils pru- dence in priva</em> and public
matters, the orderly management of home and family, the art of rhetoric
or persuasive speaking, and the ability to under- sti&lt;.nd and direct
affairs of state.“ He defends his high fees by saying that It is his
custom, when a pupil objects to the sum asked, to agree to receive as
adequate v^hatever amount the pupil may name as just in a solemn
statement before some sacred shrine“ — a rash procedure for a teacher
who doubted the existence of the gods. Diogenes Laertius accuses him of
being the first to “arm disputants with the weapon of sophism,” a charge
that would have pleased Socrates; but Diogenes adds that Protagoras “was
also the first to invent that sort of argument which is called
Socratic”“— which might not have pleased Socrates.</p>
<p>It was but one of his many distinctions that he founded European
gram- mar and philology. He treated of the right use of words, says
Plato,“ and was the first to distinguish the three genders of nouns, and
certain tenses and moods of verbs.“ But his chief significance lay in
this, that with him, rather than with Socrates, began the subjective
standpoint in philosophy. Unlike the lonians he was less interested in
things than in thought — i.e., in the whole process of sensation,
perception, understanding, and expression. Whereas Parmenides rejected
sensation as a guide to truth, Protagoras, like Locke, accepted it as
the only means of knowledge, and refused to admit any transcendental —
suprasensual — reality. No absolute truth can be found, said Protagoras,
but only such truths as hold for given men under given conditions;
contradictory assertions can be equally true for different per- sons or
at different times.“ All truth, goodness, and beauty are relative and
subjective; “ man is the measure of all things — of those that are, that
they are, and of those that are not, that they are not.”“ To the
historical eye a whole world begins to tremble when Protagoras announces
this sim- ple principle of humanism and relativity; all established
truths and sacred</p>
<p>•These probably occurred in 451 - 45, 432, 422, and 415“</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>principles crack; individualism has found a voice and a philosophy;
and the supernatural bases of social order threaten to melt away.</p>
<p>The far-reaching skepticism implicit in this famous pronouncement
might liave remained theoretical and safe had not Protagoras applied it
for a mo- ment to theology. Among a group of distinguished men in the
home of the unpopular freethinker, Euripides, Protagoras read a treatise
whose first sentence made a stir in Athens. “With regard to the gods I
know not whether they exist or not, or what they are like. Many things
prevent our knowing: the subject is obscure, and brief is the span of
our mortal life.”“ The Athenian Assembly, frightened by that ominous
prelude, banished Protagoras, ordered all Athenians to surrender any
copies they might have of his writings, and burned the books in the
market place. Protagoras fled to Sicily, and, story tells us, was
drowned on the way.“</p>
<p>Gorgias of Leontini carried on this skeptical revolution, but had
the</p>
<p>good sense to spend most of his life outside of Athens. His career
was typi- cal of the union between philosophy and statesmanship in
Greece. Bom about 483, he studied philosophy and rhetoric with
Empedocles, and be- came so famous in Sicily as an orator and a teacher
of oratory that in 427 he was sent by Leontini as an ambassador to
Athens. At the Olympic games of 408 he captivated a great crowd by an
address in which he appealed to the warring Greeks to make peace among
themselves in order to face with unity and confidence the resurrected
power of Persia. Traveling from city to dty, he expounded his views in a
style of oratory so euphuistically ornate, so symmetrically antithetical
in idea and phrase, so delicately poised be- tween poetry and prose,
that he had no difficulty in attracting students who offered him a
hundred minas for a course of instraction. His book On Nature sought to
prove three startling propositions: ( i ) Nothing exists; (2) if
anything existed it would be unknowable; and (3) if anything were
knowable the knowledge of it could not be communicated from one person
to another.*“ Nothing else remains of Gorgias’ writings. After enjoying
the hospitality and fees of many states he settled down in Thessaly, and
had the wisdom to consume most of his great fortune before his death.“
He lived, as all authorities assure us, to at least one hundred and
five; and an cient writer tells us that “though Gorgias attained to the
age of one hun - dred and eight, his body was not weakened by old age,
but to the end of his life he was in sound condition, and his senses
were those of a youth.””</p>
<p>•These propositions, aiming t o discredit the transcendentalism of
Parmenides, meant: (i) Nothing exists beyond the senses; (2) if anything
existed beyond the senses it would be un - knowable, for all knowledge
comes through the senses; (3) if anything suprasensual were knowable,
the knowledge of it would be incommunicable, since all communication is
through</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 361</p>
<p>If the Sophists together constituted a scattered university, Hippias
of Elis was a university in himself, and typified the polymath in a
world where knowledge was not yet so vast as to be clearly beyond the
grasp of one mind. He taught astronomy and mathematics, and made
original contribu- tions to geometry; he was a poet, a musician, and an
orator; he lectured on literature, morals, and politics; he was an
historian, and laid the foundations of Greek chronology by compiling a
list of victors at the Olympic games; he was employed by Elis as an
envoy to other states; and he knew so many arts and trades that he made
with his own hands all his clothing and orna- ments.” His work in
philosophy was slight but important: he protested</p>
<p>All in all, the Sophists must be ranked among the most vital factors
in the history of Greece. They invented grammar and logic for Europe;
they developed dialectic, analyzed the forms of argument, and taught men
how to detect and practice fallacies. Through their stimulus and example
reasoning became a ruling passion with the Greeks. By applying logic to
language they promoted clarity and precision of thought, and facilitated
the accurate transmission of knowledge. Through them prose became a form
of literature, and poetry became a vehicle of philosophy. They ap- plied
analysis to everything; they refused to respect traditions that could
not be supported by the evidence of the senses or the logic of reason;
and they shared decisively in a rationalist movement that finally broke
down, among the intellectual classes, the ancient faith of Hellas. “The
common opinion” of his time, says Plato, derived “the world and all
animals and plants . . . and inanimate substances from . . . some
spontaneous and unin- telligent cause.””“ Lysias tells of an atheistic
society that called itself the - days set apart for fasting.’” Pindar,
at the opening of the fifth century, accepted the oracle of Delphi
piously; Aeschylus defended it politically; Herodotus, about 450,
criticized it timidly; Thucydides, at the end of the century, openly
rejected it. Euthyphro complained that when in the As-</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>sembly he spoke of oracles, the people laughed at him as an
antiquated fool.“*</p>
<p>The Sophists must not be blamed or credited for all of this; much of
it was in the air, and was a natural result of growing wealth, leisure,
travel, research, and speculation. Their role in the deterioration of
morals was likewise contributory rather than basic; wealth of itself,
without the aid of philosophy, puts an end to puritanism and stoicism.
But within these modest limits the Sophists unwittingly quickened
disintegration. Most of them, barring a thoroughly human love of money,
were men of high char- acter and decent life; but they did not transmit
to their pupils the tradi- tions or the wisdom that had made or kept
them reasonably virtuous despite their discovery of the secular origin
and geographical mutability of morals. Their colonial derivation may
have led them to underestimate the value of custom as a peaceful
substitute for force or law in maintaining morality and order. To define
morality or human worth in terms of knowledge, as Protagoras did a
generation before Socrates,”* was a heady stimulus to thought, but an
unsteadying blow to character; the emphasis on knowledge raised the
educational level of the Greeks, but it did not develop intelli- gence
as rapidly as it liberated intellect. The announcement of the relativity
of knowledge did not make men modest, as it should, but disposed every
man to consider himself the measure of all things; every clever youth
could now feel himself fit to sit in judgment upon the moral code of his
people, reject it if he could not understand and approve it, and then be
free to rationalize his desires as the virtues of an emancipated soul.
The distinc- tion between “Nature” and convention, and the wi llingness
of minor Sophists to argue that what “Nature” permitted was good
regardless of custom or law, sapped the ancient supports of Greek
morality, and en- couraged many experiments in living. Old men mourned
the passing of domestic simplicity and fidelity, and the pursuit of
pleasure or wealth unchecked by religious restraints.”” Plato and
Thucydides speak of think - ers and public men who rejected morals as
superstitions, and acknowledged no right but strength. This unscrupulous
individualism turned the logic and rhetoric of the Sophists into an
instrument of legal chicanery and political demagogy, and degraded their
broad cosmopolitanism into a cau- tious reluctance to defend their
country, or an unprejudiced readiness to sell it to the highest bidder.
The religious peasantry and the conservative aristocrats began to agree
with the common citizen of the urban democracy that philosophy had
become a danger to the state.</p>
<p>Some of the philosophers themselves joined in the attack upon the
Soph-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 363</p>
<p>ists. Socrates condemned them (as Aristophanes was to condemn
Socrates) for making error specious with logic and persuasive with
rhetoric, and scorned them for taking fees.^* He excused his ignorance
of grammar on the ground that he could not afford the fifty-drachma
course of Prodi- cus, but only the one-drachma course, which gave merely
the rudiments.“* In an ungenial moment he used a merciless and revealing
comparison:</p>
<p>It is believed among us. Antiphon, that it is possible to dispose
of</p>
<p>beauty or of wisdom alike honorably or dishonorably; for if a
per-</p>
<p>son sells his Beauty for money to anyone that wishes to purchase it,
men call him a male prostitute; but if anyone makes a friend of</p>
<p>a person whom he knows to be an honorable and worthy admirer,</p>
<p>we regard him as prudent. In like manner those who sell their
wis-</p>
<p>dom for money to any that will buy, men call sophists, or, as it</p>
<p>were, prostitutes of wisdom; but whoever makes a friend of a person
whom he knows to be deserving, and teaches him all the good that</p>
<p>he knows, we consider him to act the part which becomes a good</p>
<p>and honorable citizen.“®</p>
<p>Plato could afford to agree with this view, being a rich man.
Isocrates be- gan his career with a speech Against the Sophists, became
a successful pro- fessor of rhetoric, and charged a thousand drachmas
(000) for a course.”* Aristotle continued the attack; he defined a
Sophist as one who “is only eager to get rich off his apparent wisdom
,’”” and accused Protagoras of “promising to make the worse appear the
better reason.’’”*</p>
<p>The tragedy was deepened by the fact that both sides were right. The
complaint about fees was unjust: short of a state subsidy no other way
was then open to finance higher education. If the Sophists criticized
tra- ditions and morals it was, of course, with no evil intent; they
thought that they were liberating slaves. They were the intellectual
representatives of their time, sharing its passion for the free
intellect; like the Encyclopedists of Enlightenment France they swept
away the dying past with magnifi- cent elan, and did not live long
enough, or think far enough, to establish new institutions in place of
those that loosened reason would destroy. In every civilization the time
comes when old ways must be re-examined if the society is to readjust
itself to irresistible economic change; the Sophists were the instrument
of this re-examination, but failed to provide the states- manship for
the readjustment. It remains to their credit that they power- fully
stimulated the pursuit of knowledge, and made it fashionable to think.
From every comer of the Greek world they brought new ideas and chal-
lenges to Athens, and aroused her to philosophical consciousness and

impossible.</p>
<p>V. SOCRATES</p>
<p>1 . The Mask oj Silenus</p>
<p>It is pleasant to stand at last face to face with a personality
apparently so real as Socrates. But when we consider the two sources
upon which we must rely for our knowledge of Socrates we find that one
of them, Plato, writes imaginative dramas, that the other, Xenophon,
writes historical nov- els, and that neither prod uct can be taken as
history. “They say,” writes Diogenes Laertius, “that Socrates having
heard Plato read the Lysis, cried out, ‘O Heracles! what a number of
lies the young man has told about me!’ For Plato had set down a great
many things as sayings of Socrates which he had never said.’”“ Plato
does not pretend to limit Wmself to fact; probably it never occurred to
him that the future might have scant means of distinguishing, in his
work, imagination from biography. But he draws so consistent a picture
of his master throughout the Dialogues, from Socrates’ youthful timidity
in the Parmenides and his insolent loquacity in the Protagoras to the
subdued piety and resignation of the Phaedo, that if this was not
Socrates, then Plato is one of the greatest character creators in all
literature. Aristotle accepts as authentically Socratic the views
attrib- uted to Socrates in the Protagoras.“^* Recently discovered
fragments of an Alcibiades written by Aeschines of Sphettos, an
immediate disciple of Socrates, tend to confirm the portrait given in
the earlier dialogues of Plato, and the story of the philosopher’s
attachment to Alcibiades.”® On the other hand, Aristotle classes
Xenophon’s Memorabilia and Banquet as forms of fiction, imaginary
conversations in which Socrates becomes, more often than not, a
mouthpiece for Xenophon’s ideas. *“* If Xenophon honestly played
Eckermann to Socrates’ Goethe we can only say that he has care - fully
collected the master’s safest platitudes; it is incredible that so
virtuous a man should have upset a civilization. Other ancient writers
did not make the old sage into such a saint; Aristoxenus of Tarentum,
about 318, re- ported, on the testimony of his father — who claimed to
have known Socrates — that the philosop her was a person without
education, “ignorant and debauched”;”’ and Eupolis, the comic poet,
rivaled his rival Aristophanes</p>

great gadfly.”* Making due discount for polemic vitriol it is at least
clear that Socrates was a man, hated and loved beyond any other figure
of his time.</p>
<p>His father was a sculptor, and he himself was said to have carved
a</p>
<p>Hermes, and three Graces that stood near the entrance to the
Acropolis,”* Efis mother was a midwife: it was a standing joke with him
that he merely continued her trade, but in the realm of ideas, helping
others to deliver themselves of their conceptions. One tradition
describes him as the son of a slave it is improbable, for he served as a
hoplite (a career open only to citizens), inherited a house from his
father, and had seventy minas (000) invested for him by his friend Cri
to;’” for the rest he is represented as poor.”* He paid much attention
to the training of the body, and was usu - ally in good physical
condition. He made a reputation for himself as a soldier during the
Peloponnesian War: in 432 he fought at Potidaea, in 424 at Delium, in
422 at Amphipolis. At Potidaea he saved both the life and the arms of
the young Alcibiades, and gave up in the youth’s favor his claim to the
prize for valor; at Delium he was the last Athenian to give ground to
the Spartans, and seems to have saved himself by glaring at the enemy;
even the Spartans were frightened. In these campaigns, we are told, he
excelled all in endurance and courage, bearing without complaint hunger,
fatigue, and cold.”* At home, when he condescended to stay there, he
worked as a stonecutter and statuary. He had no interest in travel, and
seldom went outside the city and its port. He married Xanthippe, who
berated him for neglecting his family; he recognized the justice of her
complaint,”* and defended he r gallantly to his son and his friends.
Mar- riage disturbed him so little that he seems to have taken an
additional wife when the mortality of males in the war led to the
temporary legalization of polygamy .“*</p>
<p>All the world knows the face of Socrates. Judging precariously
from</p>
<p>the bust in the Museo delle Terme at Rome, it was not typically
Greek;”* its spacious spread, its flat, broad nose, its thick lips, and
heavy beard suggest rather Solon’s friend of the steppes, Anacharsis, or
that modern Scyt hian, Tolstoi. “I say,” Alcibiades insists, even while
protesting his love, “that Socrates is exactly like the masks of
Silenus, which may be seen sitting in the statuaries’ shops, having

<p>matters worse he confesses to an unduly large paunch, and hopes to
reduce it by dancing.”*</p>
<p>Plato and Xenophon agree in describing his habits and his character.
He was content with one simple and shabby robe throughout the year, and
liked bare feet better than sandals or shoes.<em>” He was incredibly
free from the acquisitive fever that agitates mankind. Viewing the
multitude of arti- cles exposed for sale in the market place, he
remarked, “How many things there are that I do not want!”</em>”— and
felt himself rich in his poverty. He was a model of moderation and
self-control, but all the world away from a saint. He could drink like a
gentleman, and needed no timid asceticism to keep him straight.* He was
no recluse; he liked good company, and let the rich entertain him now
and then; but he made no obeisance to them, could get along very well
without them, and rejected the gifts and invitations of magnates and
kings.*® All in all he was fortunate: he lived without working, read
without writing, taught without routine, drank without dizziness, and
died before senility, almost without pain.</p>
<p>His morals were excellent for his time, but would hardly satisfy all
the good people who praise him. He “took fire” at the sight of
Charmides, but controlled himself by asking if this handsome lad had
also a “noble soul.”<em>” Plato speaks of Socrates and Alcibiades as
lovers, and describes the philoso- pher “in chase of the fair
youth.”</em>” Though the old man seems to have kept these amours for the
most part Platonic, he was not above giving advice to homosexuals and
hetairai on how to attract lovers.*” He gallantly prom - ised his help
to the courtesan Theodota, who rewarded him with the invi- tation: “Come
often to see me.”**’ His good humor and kindliness were so unfailin g
that those who could stomach his politics found it simple to put up with
his morals. When he had passed away Xenophon spoke of him as “so just
that he wronged no man in the most trifling affair … so temperate that
he never preferred pleasure to virtue; so wise that he never erred in
distin- guishing better from worse … so capable of discerning the
character of others, and of exhorting them to virtue and honor, that he
seemed to be such as the best and happiest of men would be.”<em>“ Or, as
Plato put it, with mov- ing simplicity, he “was truly the wisest, and
justest, and best of all the men whom I have ever known.”</em>“</p>
<p>• “So far as drinking is concerned,” Xenophon makes Socrates say,
“wine does of a truth</p>
<p><em>moisten the soul’ and lull our griefs to sleep. . . . But I
suspect that men’s bodies fare like those of plants. . . . When God
gives the plants water in floods to drink they cannot stand up straight
or let the breezes blow through them; but when they drink only as much
as they enj oy they grow up straight and tall, and come to full and
abundant fruitage.”“</em></p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION</p>
<p>367</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Portrait of a Gadfly</li>
</ol>
<p>Being curious and disputatious he became a student of philosophy, and
was for a time fascinated by the Sophists who invaded Athens in his
youth. There is no evidence that Plato invented the fact as well as the
content of Socrates’ meetings with Parmenides, Protagoras, Gorgias,
Prodicus, Hip - pias, and Thrasymachus; it is likely that he saw Zeno
when the latter came to Athens about 450, and that he was so infected
with Zeno’s dialectic that it never left him.’“ Probably he knew
Anaxagoras, if not in person then in doctrine; for Archelaus of Miletus,
pupil of Anaxagoras, was for a time the teacher of Socrates. Archelaus
began as a physicist and ended as a student of morals; he explained the
origin and basis of morals on ration- alistic lines, and perhaps turned
Socrates from science to ethics.’“ By all these avenues Socrates c^e to
philosophy, and thenceforth found his “greatest good in daily converse
about virtue, examining myself and others; for a life unscrutinized is
unworthy of a man.”* So he went prowling among men’s beliefs, prodding
them with questions, demanding precise an swers and consistent views,
and making himself a terror to all who could not think clearly. Even in
Hades he proposed to be a gadfly, and “find out who is wise, and who
pretends to be wise and is not.’”** He protected himself from a similar
cross-examination by announcing that he knew nothing; he knew all the
questions, but none of the answers; he modestly called himself an
“amateur in philosophy.’”“ What he meant, presumably, was that he was
certain of nothing except man’s fallibility, and had no ha rd and fast
system of dogmas and principles. When the oracle at Delphi, to
Chaerephon’s alleged inquiry, “Is any man wiser than Socrates?” gave the
alleged reply, “No one,’”“ Socrates ascribed the response to his
profession of ignorance.</p>
<p>From that moment he set himself to the pragmatic task of getting
clear ideas. “For himself,” he said, “he would hold discourse, from time
to time, on what concerned mankind, considering what was pious, what
impious; what was just, what unjust; what was sanity, what insanity;
what was courage, what cowardice; what was the nature of government over
men, and the quahties of one skilled in governing them; and touching on
other subjects … of which he thought that those who were ignorant might
justly be deemed no bet ter than slaves.’”*’ To every vague notion, easy
generali - zation, or secret prejudice he pointed the challenge, ‘What
is it?” and asked for precise definitions. It became his habit to rise
early and go to the mar- ket place, the gymnasiums, the palaestras, or
the workshops of artisans, and • De anexetastos bios ou biotos

<p>engage in discussion any person who gave promise of a stimulating
intelli- gence or an amusing stupidi ty. “Is not the road to Athens made
for con - versation?” he asked.’“ His method was simple: he called for
the definition of a large idea; he examined the definition, usually to
reveal its incomplete- ness, its contradictoriness, or its absurdity; he
led on, by question after question, to a fuller and juster definition,
which, however, he never gave. Sometimes he proceeded to a general
conception, or exposed another, by investigating a long series of
particular instances, thereby introducing a measure of induction into
Greek logic; sometimes, with the famous So- cratic irony, he unveiled
the ridiculous consequences of the definition or opinion he wished to
destroy. He had a passion for orderly thinking, and liked to classify
individual things according to their genus, species, and specific
difference, thereby preparing for Aristotle’s method of definition as
well as for Plato’s theory of Ideas. He liked to describe dialectic as
the art of careful distinctions. And he salted the weary wastes of logic
with a humor that died an early death in the history of philosophy.</p>
<p>His opponents objected that he tore down but never built, that he re-
jected every answer but gave none of his own, and that the results de-
moralized morals and paralyzed thought. In many cases he left the idea
that he had set out to clarify more obscure than before. When a resolute
fellow like Critias tried to question him he turned his reply into
another question, and at once recaptured the advantage. In the
Frotagoras he offers to answer instead of asking, but his good
resolution lasts but a moment; whereupon Protagoras, being an old hand
at the game of logic, quietly with- draws from the argument.’“ Hippias
rages at Socrates’ elusiveness: “By Zeus!” he cries, “you shall n ot
hear 〔my answer〕 until you yourself declare what you think justice to
be; for it is not enough that you laugh at others, questioning and
confuting everybody, while you yourself are unwilling to give a reason
to anybody, or to declare your opinion on any subject.’”“ To such taunts
Socrates replied that he was only a midwife like his mother. “The
reproach which is often made against me, that I ask questions of others
and have not the wit to answer them myself, is very just. The reason is
that the go d compels me to be a midwife, but forbids me to bring
forth”™ — a deus ex machina worthy of his friend Euripides.</p>
<p>In many ways he resembled the Sophists, and the Athenians applied the
name to him without hesitation, and usually without reproach.*“ Indeed,
he was often a Sophist in the modem sense: he was rich in crafty dodges
and argumentative tricks, slyly changed the scope or meaning of terms,
drowned the problem in loose analogies, quibbled like a schoolboy,
and</p>

<p>beat the wind bravely with words.<em>” The Athenians might be excused
for giving him hemlock, since there is no pest like a conscious
logician. In four points he differed from the Sophists; he despised
rhetoric, he wished to strengthen morality, he did not profess to teach
anything more than the art of examining ideas, and he refused to take
pay for his instruction — though he appears to have accepted occasional
help from his rich friends.</em>” With all his irritating faults his
stude nts loved him deeply. “Perhaps,” he says to one of them, “I may be
able to assist you in the pursuit of honor and virtue, from being
mutually disposed to love; for whenever I conceive a liking for persons
I devote myself with ardor, and with my whole mind, to love them, and be
loved by them in return, regretting their absence and having mine
regretted by them, and longing for their society while they long for
mine.”*”</p>
<p>Aristophanes’ Clouds represents the pupils of Socrates as forming a
school with a regular meeting place; and a passage in Xenophon lends
some color to this conception.<em>” Usually he is pictured as teaching
wherever he found a pupil or a listener. But no common doctrine united
his followers; they differed so widely among themselves that they became
the leaders of the most diverse philosophical schools and theories in
Greece — Platonism, Cyni- cism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism.
There was the proud and humble Antisthenes, who took from his master the
doctrine of simplicity in life and needs, and founded the Cynic school;
perhaps he was present when Socrates said to Antiphon: “You seem to
think that happiness consists in luxury and extravagance; but I think
that to want nothing is to resemble the gods, and that to want as little
as possible is to make the nearest approach to the gods.”</em>” There
was Aristippus, who derived from Socrates’ placid acceptance of pleasure
as a good the doctrine which he later developed at Cyrene, and which
Epicurus would preach at Athens. There was Eucleides of Megara, who
sharpened the Socratic dialectic into a skepticism that denied the
possibility of any real knowledge. There was the young Phaedo, who had
been reduced to slavery, and had been ransomed by Crito at the behest of
Socrates; Socra tes loved the lad, and “made him a philosopher.”<em>”
There was the restless Xenophon who, though he gave up philosophy for
soldiering, testified that “nothing was of greater benefit than to
associate with Socrates, and to converse with him, on any occasion, on
any subject whatever.”</em>” There was Plato, upon whose vivid
imagination the sage made so lasting an impression that the two minds
are mingled forever in philo- sophical history. There was the rich
Crito, who “looked upon Socrates</p>
<p>37° THE LIFE OF GREECE (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>of anything.””” There was the dashing young Alcibiades, whose
infidelities were to discredit and endanger his teacher, but who now
loved Socrates with characteristic abandon, and said:</p>
<p>When we hear any other speaker, even a very good one, his words</p>
<p>produce absolutely no effect upon us in comparison, whereas the</p>
<p>very fragments of your words, Socrates, even at second hand, and</p>
<p>however imperfectly reported, amaze and possess the souls of every
man, woman and child who comes within hearing of them. … I am</p>
<p>conscious that if I did not shut my ears against him and fly from</p>
<p>the voice of the siren, he would detain me until I grew old
sitting</p>
<p>at his feet. … I have known in my soul, or in my heart . . . that</p>
<p>greatest of pangs, more violent in ingenuous youth than any ser-</p>
<p>pent’s tooth, the pang of philosophy. . . . And you, Phaedrus,
you,</p>
<p>Agathon, you, Eryximachus, you, Pausanias, you, Aristodemus, you,</p>
<p>Aristophanes, all of you, and I need not say Socrates himself,
have</p>
<p>all had experience of the same madness and passion for philosophy</p>
<p>There was the oligarchic leader Critias, who enjoyed Socrates’ quips
against democracy, and helped to incriminate him by writing a play in
which he described the gods as the invention of clever statesmen who
used them as night watchmen to frighten men into decency And there was
the son of the democratic leader Anytus, a lad who preferred to hear
Socrates discourse rather than to attend to his business, which was
dealing in leather. Anytus complained that Socrates had unsettled the
boy with skepticism, that the boy no longer respected his parents or the
gods; more- over, Anytus resented Socrates’ criticisms of democracy.*’“
“Socrates,” says Anytus, “I think you are too ready to speak evil of
men; and if you Wl take my advice, I would recommend you to be careful.
Perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than
to do them good; and this is cert ainly the case at Athens.””” Anytus
bided his time.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Philosophy of Socrates</li>
</ol>
<p>Behind the method was a philosophy, elusive, tentative, unsystematic,
but so real that in effect the man died for it. At first sight there is
no Socratic philosophy; but this is largely because Socrates, accepting
the relativism of Protagoras, refused to dogmatize, and was certain only
of his ignorance.</p>
<p>•Possibly, as Plutarch and Athenaeus assure us, Anytus loved
Alcibiades, who rejected him for Socrates.^®*</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 37I</p>
<p>Though condemned for irreligion, Socrates gave at least lip service
to the gods of his city, participated in its religious ceremonies, and
was never known to utter an impious word.“* He professed to follow, in
all important negative decisions, an inner daimonion which he described
as a sign from heaven. Perhaps this spirit was another play of the
Socratic irony; if so, it was remarkably well sustained; and it is but
one class of many appeals, in S ocrates, to oracles and dreams as
messages from the gods.*” He argued that</p>
<p>He applied this skepticism even more rigorously to the physical
sciences. One should study them only so far as to guide his life; beyond
that they are an inscrutable maze; each mystery, when solved, reveals a
deeper mystery.™ In his youth he had studied science with Archela us; in
his maturity he turned from it as a more or less plausible myth, and
interested himself no longer in facts and origins but in values and
ends. “He dis - coursed,” says Xenophon, “always of human affairs.’”’*
The Sophists had also “turned around” from natural science to man, and
had begun the study of sensation, perception, and knowledge; Socrates
went further inward to study human character and purpose. “Tell me,
Euthydemus, have you ever gone to Delphi?” “Yes, twice.” “And did you
observe what is written on the temple wall — Know thyself?” “I did.”
“And did you take no thought of that inscription, or did you attend to
it, and try to examine yourself, and ascertain what sort of character
you are?’”**</p>
<p>Philosophy, therefore, was for Socrates neither theology nor
metaphysics nor physics, but ethics and politics, with logic as an
introduction and a means. Coming at the close of the Sophistic period,
he perceived that the Sophists had created one of the most critical
situations in the history of any culture — the weakening of the
supernatural basis of morals. Instead of a</p>
<p>THE LIFE OF GREECE</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>frightened return to orthodoxy, he moved forward to the profoundest
ques- tion that ethics can ask: is a natural ethic possible? Can
morality survive without supernatural behef? Can philosophy, by molding
an effective secu- lar moral code, save the civilization which its
freedom of thought has threatened to destroy? When, in the Euthyphro,
Socrates argues that the good is not good because the gods approve of
it, but that the gods approve of it because it is good, he is proposing
a philosophical revolution. His con- ception of good, so far from being
theological, is earthly to the point of being utilitarian. Goodness, he
thinks, is not general and abstract, but spe- cific and practical, “good
for something.” Goodness and beauty are forms of usefulness and human
advantage; even a dung basket is beautiful if it is well formed for its
purpose.”’ Since (Socrates thought) there i s nothing else so useful as
knowledge, knowledge is the highest virtue, and all vice is ignorance’™—
though “virtue” {arete) here means excellence rather than sinlessness.
Without proper knowledge right action is impossible; with proper
knowledge right action is inevitable. Men never do that which they know
to be wrong — i.e., unwise, injurious to themselves. The highest good is
happiness, the highest means to it is knowledge or intelligence.</p>
<p>If knowledge is the highest excellence, Socrates argues, aristocracy
is the best form of government, and democracy is nonsense. “It is
absurd,” says Xenophon’s Socrates, “to choose magistrates by lot where
no one would dream of drawing lots for a pilot, a mason, a flute-player,
or any craftsman at all, though the shortcomings of such men are far
less harmful than those that disorder our government.””* He condemns the
litigiousness of the Athenians, their noisy envy of one another, the
bitterness of their political factions and disputes: “On these
accounts,” he says, “I am constantly in the greatest fear lest some evil
should happen to the state too great for it to bear.”™* Nothing could
save Athens, he thought, except government by knowledge and ability; and
this was no more to be determined by voting than the qualifications of a
pilot, a musician, a physician, or a carpenter. Nor should power or
wealth choose the officials of the state; tyranny and plutocracy are as
bad as democracy; the reasonable compromise is an aristocracy in which
office would be restricted to those mentally fit and trained for it.™*
Despite these criticisms of Athenian democracy Socrates</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE CONFLICT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 373</p>
<p>faults civilization is a precious thing, not to be abandoned for any
primeval simplicity.*®</p>
<p>Nevertheless the majority of the Athenians looked upon him with irri-
tated suspicion. The orthodox in religion considered him to be the most
dangerous of the Sophists; for while he observed the amenities of the
ancient faith he rejected tradition, wished to subject every rule to the
scrutiny of reason, founded morality in the individual conscience rather
than in social good or the unchanging decrees of heaven, and ended with
a skepticism that left reason itself in a mental confusion unsettling to
every custom and belief. To him, as well as to Protagoras and Euripides,
praisers of the past like Aristophanes attributed the irreligion of the
age, the dis- respect of the young for the old, the loosened morals of
the educated classes, and the disorderly individualism that was
consuming Athenian life. Though Socrates refused to support the
oligarchic faction, many of its leaders were liis pupils or his friends.
When one of them, Critias, led the oligarchs in a rich man’s revolution
and a ruthless terror, democrats like Anytus and Meletus branded
Socrates as the intellectual source of the oligarchic reac- tion, and
determined to remove him from Athenian life.</p>
<p>They succeeded, but they could not destroy his immense influence. The
dialectic he had received from Zeno was passed down through Plato to
Aristotle, who turned it into a system of logic so complete that it
remained unaltered for nineteen hundred years. Upon science his
influence was injurious: students were turned away from physical
research, and the doc- trine of external design offered no encouragement
to scientific analysis. The individualist and intellectualist ethic of
Socrates had a modest share, perhaps, in undermining Athenian morals;
but its emphasis on conscience as above the law became one of the
cardinal tenets of Christianity.</p>
<p>Through his pupils the many suggestions of his thought became the
sub- stance of all the major philosophies of the next two centuries. The
most powerful element in his influence was the example of his life and
charac- ter. He became for Greek history a martyr and a saint; and every
genera- tion that sought an exemplar of simple living and brave thinking
turned back to nourish its ideals with h is memory. “In contemplating
the man’s wisdom and nobility of character,” said Xenophon, “I find it
beyond my power to forget him, or, in remembering him, to refrain from
praising him. And if, among those who make virtue their aim, any one has
ever been brought into contact with a person more helpful than Socrates,
I count that man worthy to be called most blessed.’”®</p>
