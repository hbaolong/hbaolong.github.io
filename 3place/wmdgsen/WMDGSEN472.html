<h4 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>France Besieged</p>
<p>1300-1461</p>
<p>I. THE FRENCH SCENE</p>
<p>T HE France of 1300 was by no means the majestic realm that today
reaches from the Channel to the Mediterranean, and from the Vosges and
Alps to the Atlantic. On the east it reached only to the Rhone. In the
southwest a large area — Guienne and Gascony — had been added to the
Eng- lish crown by tne marriage of Henry II to Eleanor of Aquitaine
(1152) ; in the north England had taken the county of Ponthieu, with
Abbeville; and though the English kings held these lands as fiefs of the
French monarchs, they maintained over them an effectual sovereignty.
Provence, the Dauphine, and Franche- Comte (“free county”) belonged to
the Holy Roman Empire, whose heads were usually Germans. The French
kings ruled indirectly, through their close kin, the princely appanages
of Valois, Anjou, Bourbon, and Angouleme. They ruled directly, as royal
domains, Normandy, Picardy, Champagne, Poitou, Auvergne, most of
Languedoc, and the Ile-de-France the “island” of north central France
centering about Paris. Artois, Blois, Nevers, Limoges, Armagnac, and
Valentinois were governed by feudal lords who alternately lip-served and
fought the kings of France. Brittany, Burgundy, and Flanders were French
fiefs, but they were, as Shakespeare called them, “almost kingly
dukedoms,” b ehaving as virtually independent states. France was not yet
France.</p>
<p>The most vital and volatile of the French fiefs at the opening of the
four- teenth century was the county of Flanders. In all Europe north of
the Alps only Flanders rivaled Italy in economic development. Its
boundaries fluc- tuated confusingly in time and space; let us denote it
as the region enclosing Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, and Courtrai. East of the
Scheldt lay the duchy of Brabant, then including Antwerp, Mechlin
(Malines), Brussels, Toumai, and Louvain. To the south of Flanders lay
the independent bishoprics of Liege and Cambrai, and the county of
Hainaut, around Valenciennes. Used loosely, “Flanders” included Brabant,
Liege, Cambrai, and Hainaut. On the north were seven little
principalities roughly composing the Holland of today. These Dutch
regions would not reach their flowering till the seventeenth century,
when their empire would stretch, so to speak, from</p>

<p>FRANCE BESIEGED</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Rembrandt to Batavia. But already in 1300 Flanders and Brabant
throbbed with industry, commerce, and class war. A canal twelve miles
long joined Bruges to the North Sea; a hundred vessels sailed it every
day, bringing mer- chandise from a hundred ports in three continents;
Aeneas Sylvius ranked Bruges among the three most beautiful cities in
the world. The goldsmiths of Bruges made up an entire division of the
town’s militia; the weavers of Ghent provided twenty-seven regiments of
its armed forces, which totaled 189,000 men.</p>
<p>The medieval guild organization, which had dowered the craftsman with
the dignity of freedom and the pride of skill, was now giving way, in
the textile and metal industries of Flanders and Brabant, to a
capitalist system * in which an employer supplied capital, materials,
and machinery to shop- workers paid by the piece and no longer protected
by the guild. Admission to a guild became ever costlier; thousands of
workers became journeymen — day laborers — who went from town to town,
from shop to shop, getting only temporary employment, with wages that
forced them to live in slums and left them little property beyond the
clothes they wore. 1 Communistic ideas appeared among proletaires and
peasants; the poor asked why they should go hungry while the barns of
barons and bishops creaked with grain; and all men who did not work with
their hands were denounced as parasites. The employers in their turn
complained of the risks their investments ran, the uncertainty and
periodicity of supplies, the foundering of their cargoes, the
fluctuations of the market, the tricks of competitors, and the repeated
strikes that raised wages and prices, unsettled the currency, and
narrowed some employers’ profits to the edge of solvency. 2 Louis de
Nevers, Count of Flanders, sided too strongly with the employers. The
populace of Bruges and Ypres, supported by the neighboring peasantry,
rose in revolt, deposed Louis, plundered abbeys, and slew a few
millionaires. The Church laid an interdict upon the revolted regions;
the rebels nevertheless forced the priests to say Mass; and one leader,
stealing a march of 450 years on Diderot, vowed he would never be
content till the last priest had been hanged.® Louis ap- pealed to his
liege lord, the French king; Philip VI came, defeated the revolu-
tionary forces at Cassel (1328), hanged the burgomaster of Bruges,
restored the count, and made Flanders a dependency of France.</p>
<p>France in general was much less industrialized than Flanders;
manufac- turing for the most part remained in the handicraft stage; but
Lille, Douai, Cambrai, and Amiens echoed the textile busyness of the
near-by Flemish towns. Internal commerce was hampered by bad roads and
feudal tolls, but</p>
<ul>
<li>We may define capital as goods or funds used to produce goods for
consumption; a cap- italist as an investor or provider of capital;
capitalism as an economic system or process dominated by
capitalists.</li>
</ul>
<p>6o</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>favored by canals and rivers that constituted a system of natural
highways throughout France. The rising business class, in alliance with
the kings, had attained by 1 300 to a high position in the state and to
a degree of wealth that shocked the land-rich, money-poor nobility.
Merchant oligarchies ruled the cities, controlled the guilds, and
jealously restricted production and trade. Here, as in Flanders, a
revolutionary proletariat simmered in the towns.</p>
<p>In 1300 an uprising of poor peasants, known to history as Pastoureaux
— shepherds — surged through the cities as in 1251, gathering resentful
prole- taires in its wake. Led by a rebel monk, they marched southward,
mostly barefoot and unarmed, proclaiming Jerusalem as their goal.
Hungry, they pillaged shops and fields; resisted, they found weapons and
became an army. In Paris they broke open the jails and defeated the
troops of the king. Philip IV shut himself up in the Louvre, the nobles
retired to their strongholds, the merchants cowered in their homes. The
horde passed on, swelled by the destitute of the capital; now it
numbered 40,000 men and women, ruffians and pietists. At Verdun, Auch,
and Toulouse they slaughtered all available Jews. When they gathered in
Aiguesmortes, on the Mediterranean, the seneschal or sheriff of
Carcassonne surrounded them with his forces, cut off their supplies, and
waited till all the rebels had died of starvation or pestilence except a
few, whom he hanged. 4</p>
<p>What kind of government was it that left France at the mercy of
greedy wealth and lawless poverty? In many ways it was the ablest
government in Europe. The strong kings of the thirteenth century had
subjected the feudal lords to the state, had organized a national
judiciary and administration with a trained civil service, and had on
occasion summoned an Estates- or States-General: originally a general
gathering of estate owners, then a con- sultative assembly of delegates
from the nobility, the clergy, and the bur- gesses or middle class. All
Europe admired the French court, where powerful dukes, counts, and
knights mingled with silk-robed women in elegant festivi- ties and
graceful cuckoldry, and clashing jousts in glittering tournaments
sustained the glamour of chivalry. King John of Bohemia called Paris
“the</p>
<p>Paris, though always inferior to its fame, and much indebted to</p>
<p>the lies of its own people, is undoubtedly a great city. To be sure,
I</p>
<p>never saw a dirtier place, except Avignon. At the same time it
contains the most learned men, and is like a great basket in which are
collected the rarest fruits of every country. There was a time when,
from the</p>
<p>ferocity of their manners, the French were reckoned barbarians.
At</p>
<p>present the case is wholly changed. A gay disposition, love of
soci-</p>
<p>ety, ease and playfulness in conversation, now characterize them.</p>

<p>6 1</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>They seek every opportunity of distinguishing themselves, and make
war against all cares with joking, laughing, singing, eating, and drink-
ing. 8</p>
<p>Philip IV, despite his quasi-piratical confiscations from Templars
and Jews, bequeathed an almost empty treasury to his son (1314). Louis X
died after a brief reign (1316), leaving no heir but a pregnant wife.
After an interval his brother was crowned as Philip V. A rival faction
sought the throne for Louis’ four -year-old daughter Jeanne; but an
assembly of nobles and clergy issued the famous ruling (1316) that “the
laws and customs inviolably ob - served among the Franks excluded
daughters from the cr own.” 7 When Philip himself died sonless (1322),
this ruling was repeated to bar his own daughter from the throne, and
his brother was proclaimed king as Charles IV.* Very probably the
decisions aimed also to exclude from the succession the sister of Philip
IV, Isabelle, who had married Edward II of England and had borne Edward
III (1312). The French were resolved that no English king should rule
France.</p>
<p>When Charles IV died without male issue (1328) the direct line of
Cape- tian kings came to an end. Edward III, who had become King of
England the year before, presented to the assembled aristocracy of
France his claim to the French throne as a grandson of Philip IV and the
most direct living descendant from Hugh Capet. The assembly denied his
claim on the ground that Edward’s mother could not transmit to him a
crown from which she herself had been excluded by the rulings of 1316
and 1322. The barons pre- ferred a nephew of Philip IV, a count of
Valois; so Philip VI began that Valois dynasty which ruled France till
Henry IV inaugurated the Bourbon line (1589). Edward protested, but in
1329 he came to Amiens and did homage, and pledged full loyalty, to
Philip VI as his feudal lord for Gas- cony, Guienne, and Ponthieu. As
Edward grew in years and wile, he repented his homage, and dreamed again
of sitting on two thrones at once. His advisers assured him that the new
Philip was a weakling, who planned to leave soon on a crusade to the
Holy Land. It seemed a propitious time to begin the Hundred Years’
War.</p>

<p>In 1337 Edward formally renewed his claim to the French crown. The
rejection of his claim was only the proximate cause of war. After the
Norman conquest of England, Normandy had for 138 years belonged to the
English</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>kings; Philip II had reconquered it for France (1204); now many
English nobles of Norman descent could look upon the coming war as an
attempt to regain their motherland. Part of English Guienne had been
nibbled away by Philip IV and Charles IV. Guienne was fragrant with
vineyards, and the wine trade of Bordeaux was too precious a boon to
England to be lamely lost merely to defer by a few years the death of
10,000 Englishmen. Scotland was a burr in England’s side; and the French
had repeatedly allied themselves with Scotland in its wars with England.
The North Sea was full of fish; the English navy claimed sovereignty in
those waters, in the Channel, in the Bay of Biscay, and it captured
French ships that flouted this first proclamation of English rule over
the waves. Flanders was a vital outlet for British wool; English nobles
whose sheep grew the wool, English merchants who exported it, disliked
the dependence of their prime market on the good will of the King of
France.</p>
<p>In 1336 the Count of Flanders ordered all Britons there to be jailed;
ap- parently Philip VI had recommended this as a precaution against
English plots. Edward III retaliated by ordering the arrest of all
Flemings in England and forbidding the export of wool to Flanders.
Within a week the Flemish looms stopped for lack of material; workers
darkened the streets crying for employment. At Ghent artisans and
manufacturers united in renouncing alle- giance to the count; they chose
an alleged brewer, Jacob van Artevelde, as governor of the city, and
approved his policy of seeking the friendship and wool of England
(1337). Edward lifted the embargo; the count fled to Paris; all Flanders
accepted Artevelde’s dictatorship and agreed to join Eng - land in war
on France. On November 1, 1337, Edward III, following the custom of
chivalry, sent to Philip VI a formal declaration that after three days
England would begin hostilities.</p>
<p>The first major encounter of the Hundred Years’ War was a naval
engage - ment off the Flemish coast at Sluis ( 1 340) , where the
English navy destroyed 142 of the 172 vessels in the French fleet. Later
in that year Joan of Valois, sister of Philip and mother-in-law of
Edward, left her convent at Fontenelle and induced the French King to
commission her as an emissary of peace. Proceeding through many perils
to the camp of the English leaders, she won their consent to a
conference, and her heroic mediation persuaded the kings to a nine-month
truce. By the efforts of Pope Clement VI peace was main- tained till
1346.</p>
<p>During this lucid interval class war seized the stage. The
well-organized weavers of Ghent were the aristocracy of labor in the
Lowlands. They de- nounced Artevelde as a cruel tyrant, an embezzler of
public funds, a tool of England and the bourgeoisie. Artevelde had
proposed that Flanders should accept the Prince of Wales as its ruler,
and Edward III came to Sluis to con- firm the arrangement. When
Artevelde returned from Sluis to Ghent his</p>

<p>&lt;*3</p>
<p>house was surrounded by an angry crowd. He pleaded for his life as a
true Flemish patriot, but he was dragged into the street and hacked to
death (1345). 9 The weavers established a proletarian dictatorship in
Ghent, and sent agents through Flanders to urge the workers to revolt.
But the Ghent fullers fell out with the weavers, the weavers were
deposed and many of them were massacred, the people tired of their new
government, and Louis de Male, now Count of Flanders, brought all its
cities under his rule.</p>
<p>The truce having expired, Edward III invaded and devastated Normandy.
On August 26, 1346, the English and French armies met at Crecy and pre-
pared for a decisive battle. Leaders and men on both sides heard Mass,
ate the body and drank the blood of Jesus Christ, and asked His aid in
dispatching one another. 10 Then they fought with courage and ferocity,
giving no quar- ter. Edward the Black Prince earned on that day the
praise of his victorious father; Philip VI himself stood his ground till
only six of his soldiers were left on the field. Thirty thousand men, in
Fro issart’s loose estimate, died in that one engagement. Feudalism
almost died there, too: the mounted chivalry of France, charging
gallantly with short lances, stopped helpless before a wall of long
English pikes pointed at their horses’ breasts, while En glish bowmen on
the wings scattered death among the chevaliers. The long heyday of
cavalry, which had dawned at Adrianople 968 years before, here began to
fade; infantry came to the fore, and the military supremacy of the
aristocracy declined. Artillery was used at Crecy on a small scale, but
the difficulties of moving and reloading it made it more troublesome
than effective, so that Villani limited its usefulness to its noise.*
11</p>
<p>From Crecy Edward led his army to the siege of Calais, and there em-
ployed cannon against the walls ( 1 347 ) . The town held out for a
year; then, starving, it accepted Edward’s condition that the survivors
might leave in peace if six principal citizens would come to him with
ropes around their necks and the keys of the city in their hands. Six so
volunteered, and when they stood before the King he ordered them
beheaded. The Queen of Eng- land knelt before him and begged for their
lives; he yielded to her, and she had the men escorted to their homes in
safety. The women stand out with more credit than the kings in history,
and fight bravely a desperate battle to civilize the men.</p>
<p>Calais became now, and remained till 1558, a part of England, a
strategic outlet for her goods and troops upon the Continent. In 1348 it
rebelled; Ed- ward besieged it again, and himself, incognito, fought in
the assault. A French knight, Eustace de Ribeaumont, twice struck Edward
down, but was over- powered and made prisoner. When the city had been
retaken, Edward</p>

<li>ft was already a century old, for cannon had been used by the
Berbers at Sidgilmessa in</li>

<p>64 THE REFORMATION (CHAP, m</p>
<p>entertained his noble captives at dinner; English lords and the
Prince of Wales waited on them, and Edward said to Ribeaumont:</p>
<p>Sir Eustace, you are the most valiant knight in Christendom that
I</p>
<p>ever saw attack an enemy. … I adjudge to you the prize of valor</p>
<p>above all the knights of my court.</p>
<p>Removing from his head a rich chaplet that he wore, the English King
placed it upon the head of the French chevalier, saying:</p>
<p>Sir Eustace, I present you with this chaplet . . . and beg of you
to</p>
<p>wear it this year for love of me. I know that you are lively and
amor- ous, and love the company of ladies and damsels; therefore say,
wher- ever you go, that I gave it to you. I also give you your liberty,
free of ransom, and you may go whither you will. 18</p>
<p>Here and there, amid greed and slaughter, chivalry survived, and the
legends of Arthur came close to living history in the pages of
Froissart.</p>

<li>BLACK DEATH AND OTHER: 1 3 48-49</li>
</ol>
<p>The Great Plague fell impartially upon an England prosperous with</p>
<p>French spoils and a France desolate in defeat. Pestilence was a
normal inci- dent in medieval history; it harried Europe during
thirty-two years of the fourteenth century, forty-one years of the
fifteenth, thirty years of the sixteenth; so nature and human ignorance,
those resolute Malthusians, co- operated with war and famine to
counteract the reproductive ecstasies of mankind. The Black Death was
the worst of these visitations, and probably the most terrible physical
calamity in historic times. It came into Provence and France from Italy,
and perhaps more directly from the Near East through Oriental rats
landing at Marseille. In Narbonne, said a dubious tradi- tion, 30,000
persons died of it; in Paris, 50,000; 14 in Europe, 25,000,000; 15
perhaps, altogether, “one fourth of the population of the civilized
world.” 18 The medical profession was helpless; it did not know the
cause of the disease (Kitazato and Yersin discovered the bacillus of the
bubonic plague in 1894), and could only recommend bleedings, purges,
cordials, cleanliness of home and person, and fumigation with vapors of
vinegar. 17 A few physicians and priests, fearing infection, refused to
treat the sick, but the great majority of them faced the ordeal
manfully; thousands of doctors and clergymen gave their lives. 18 Of
twenty-eight cardinals alive in 1348 nine were dead a year later; of
sixty-four archbishops, twenty-five; of 375 bishops, 207. 19</p>
<p>The epidemic had effects in every, sphere of life. As the poor died
in greater proportion than the rich, a shortage of labor followed;
thousands of acres were left untilled, millions of herring died a
natural death. Labor en-</p>

<p>&lt;*5</p>
<p>joyed for a while an improved bargaining power; it raised its wages,
repu- diated many surviving feudal obligations, and staged revolts that
kept noble teeth on edge for half a century; even priests struck for
higher pay. 20 Serfs left farms for cities, industry expanded, the
business class made further gains on the landed aristocracy. Public
sanitation was goaded into moderate im- provements. The immensity of the
suffering and the tragedy weakened many minds, producing contagious
neuroses; whole groups seemed to go mad in unison, like the Flagellants
who in 1349, as they had done in the thirteenth century, marched through
the city streets almost naked, beating themselves in penitence,
preaching the Last Judgment, utopias, and pogroms. People listened with
more than customary eagerness to mind readers, dream inter- preters,
sorcerers, quacks, and other charlatans. Orthodox faith was weak- ened;
superstition flourished. Strange reasons were given for the plague. Some
ascribed it to an untimely conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars;
others to the poisoning of wells by lepers or Jews. Jews were killed in
half a hundred towns from Brussels to Breslau ( 1 348-49) . Social order
was almost destroyed by the death of thousands of police, judges,
government oflicials, bishops, and priests. Even the business of war
suffered a passing decline; from the siege of Calais to the battle of
Poitiers (1356) the Hundred Years’ War dallied in reluctant truce, while
the decimated ranks of the infantry were replenished with men too poor
to value life at more than a few shillings above death.</p>
<p>Philip VI consoled himself for plague and defeat by marrying, at
fifty-six, Blanche of Navarre, eighteen, whom he had intended for his
son. Seven months later he died. This son, John II, “the Good” (1350
-64), was good indeed to the nobles; he absolved them from taxes, paid
them to defend their lands against the English, and maintained all the
forms and graces of chivalry. He also debased the currency as an old way
to pay war debts, repeatedly raised taxes on the lower and middle
classes, and marched off in splendor to meet the English at Poitiers.
There his 15,000 knights, Scots, and servitors were routed, slain, or
captured by the 7,000 men of the Black Prince; and King John himself,
fighting lustily, leading foolishly, was among the prison- ers, along
with his son Philip, seventeen earls, and countless barons, knights, and
squires. Most of these were allowed to ransom themselves on the spot,
and many were freed on their promise to bring their ransom to Bordeaux
by Christmas. The Prince treated the King royally, and took him
leisurely to England.</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP, ni</p>
<p>ransoms of King and knights, the desolations of war and plague, and
the discouraging taxes laid upon agriculture, industry, and trade,
brought the nation to desperate revolt. A States-General of the northern
provinces, sum- moned to Paris by the nineteen-year-old Dauphin,*
Charles of Valois, to raise new taxes, undertook to establish a
parliamentary government in France. Paris and other cities had long had
parlements, but these were small appoin- tive bodies, usually of
jurists, normally limited to giving legal advice to the local ruler or
the king, and registering his decrees as part of French law. This
States-General, controlled by a transient coalition of clergy and
bourgeoisie, demanded of the royal council why the vast sums raised for
war had pro- duced only undisciplined troops and shameful defeats; it
ordered the arrest of twenty-two governmental agents, and commanded the
administrators of the treasury to return the sums they were accused of
embezzling; it imposed restrictions on the royal prerogative; it thought
even of deposing John the Good, barring his sons from the succession,
and giving the throne of France to King Charles the Bad of Navarre, a
lineal descendant of Hugh Capet. Appeased by the prudent humility of the
Dauphin, it recognized him as re- gent, and voted him funds for 30,000
men-at-arms; but it bade him dismiss corrupt or ignorant officials,
warned him against tampering with the coinage, and appointed a committee
of thirty-six men to keep an eye on the operations and expenditures of
the government. Judges were condemned for their extravagant equipage,
their dilatory idleness, their calendars twenty years behind; hereafter
they were to begin their sessions at sunrise, at the same hour when
honest citizens went to their shops or their fields. This “Great
Ordinance” of 1357 also forbade nobles to leave France or to wage
private</p>
<p>The Dauphin signed the ordinance in March, and began to evade it in
April. The English were demanding a ruinous ransom for his father, and
were threatening an advance upon Paris. The people were slow in paying
taxes, on the novel ground that these could properly be levied only by
the States-General. Hard pressed for cash, Charles called this body to
reassemble on February 1, 1358; meanwhile he further debased the
currency to increase</p>
<ul>
<li>This was apparently at first a proper name, Delphinus (Dolphin) ,
which, often repeated in the ruling families of Vienne and Auvergne,
became ( c . 1250) a title of dignity. In 1285 it was officially
conferred upon the eldest son of the Count of Vienne, and Delphinatus 01
Dauphine was thenceforth used to designate the county, of which Grenoble
is now the principal seat. In 1349 Count Humboldt II of the Viennois
sold the Dauphine, with the title Dauphin, to Charles of Valois, son of
King John II. When Charles became ldng in 1364 he transferred the tide
to his eldest son; and thereafter the eldest son of a French king was
regularly known as the Dauphin of the Viennois.</li>

<p>his funds. On February 2 Etienne Marcel, a rich merchant who, as head
of the merchant guilds, had played a leading part in formulating the
“Great Ordinance,” and had been governing Paris for a year, led an armed
band of citizens — all wearing hoods of the city’s official colors, blue
and red— into the royal palace. He rebuked Charles for disobeying the
instructions of the States-General; and when the Prince would not pledge
obedience Marcel had his men kill two chamberlains who guarded the
Dauphin, so that their blood spurted upon the royal robe. 22</p>
<p>The new States-General was horrified by this audacious violence;
never- theless it advanced the revolution by decreeing (May 1358) that
thereafter only the States-General should enact laws for France, and
that in all impor- tant matters the king was to act only with the
approval of the Estates. 23 Many members of the nobility and clergy fled
from Paris; many administrative offi - cials abandoned their posts in
fear of their lives. Marcel replaced them with burgesses, and for a time
the merchants of Paris attempted to rule France. The Dauphin took refuge
with nobles in Picardy, raised an army, and called upon the people of
Paris to surrender to him the leaders of the revolt. Marcel organized
the capital for defense, ringed it with new walls, and occupied the
Louvre, then the seat and symbol of sovereignty.</p>
<p>While revolution captured Paris the peasants of the countryside
thought it an opportune time to revenge themselves on their masters.
Still mostly serf, 24 taxed to equip their lords, taxed to ransom them,
pillaged by soldiers and brigands, tortured to disclose their laborious
savings, decimated by plague and starved by war, they rose in
uncalculating fury, forced their way into feudal castles, cut all the
noble throats their knives could reach, and relieved their hunger and
thirst in baronial hoards and cellars. The nobles had tradi- tionally
given the typically good-natured peasant the nickname of Jacques
Bonhomme — James Goodman; now thousands of such Jacques, their patience
spent, plunged into ferocious jacqueries, slew their lords, violated the
ladies, murdered the heirs, and dressed their own wives in the finery of
the dead. 26</p>
<p>Hoping that this rural revolution would divert the Dauphin from
attack- ing Paris, Marcel sent 800 of his men to aid the peasants. So
reinforced, they marched upon Meaux. The Duchesses of Orleans and
Normandy, and many other women of lofty pedigree, had sought refuge
there; now they saw a mob of serfs and tenants pouring into the town,
and gave themselves up as lost in both virtue and life. Then,
miraculously, as in some Arthurian ro- mance, a knightly band returning
from a crusade galloped into Meaux, fell upon the peasants, killed
thousands of them, and flung them by heaps into neighboring streams. The
nobles came out of hiding, laid punitive fines upon the villages, and
went through the countryside massacring 20,000 rustics, rebel or
innocent (June 13 58). 26</p>
<p>The forces of the Dauphin approached Paris, and cut off its food
supply.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>( CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>Despairing of successful resistance by other means, Marcel offered
the crown to Charles the Bad and prepared to admit his forces into the
city. Rejecting this plan as treason, Marcel’s aide and friend, Jean
Maillart, made a secret</p>
<p>In November 1359, Edward III landed with a fresh army at Calais. He
avoided Paris, respecting the walls recently raised by Marcel, but he
sub- jected the surrounding country, from Reims to Chartres, to so
systematic a destruction of crops that Paris again starved. Charles
pleaded for peace on abject terms. France would yield Gascony and
Guienne to England, free from all feudal bond to the French king; it
would also cede Poitou, Perigord, Quercy, Saintonge, Rouergue, Calais,
Ponthieu, Aunis, Angoumois, Agenois, Limousin, and Bigorre; and it would
pay 3,000,000 crowns for the return of its king. In return Edward
renounced, for himself and his descendants, all claim to the throne of
France. This Peace of Bretigny was signed on May 8, 1360, and one third
of France fretted and fumed under English rule. Two sons of King John —
the Dukes of Anjou and Berry — were sent to England as hostages for
French fidelity to the treaty; John returned to Paris amid the ringing
of bells and the joy of the noble and the simple. When the Duke of Anjou
broke parole and escaped to join his wife, King John returned to England
to replace his son as hostage, and in the hope of negotiating a milder
peace. Edward received him as a guest, and feted him’daily as the flower
of chivalry. John died in London in 1364, and was buried in St. Paul’s,
captive in death. The Dauphin, aged twenty-six, became Charles V of
France.</p>
<p>He deserved the name le Sage, the Wise, which his people gave him, if
only because he knew how to win battles without raising a hand. His
right hand was perpetually swollen and his arm was limp, so that he
could not lift a lance; it was said that he had been poisoned by Charles
the Bad. Half forced to a sedentary life, he gathered about him prudent
councilors, reorganized every department of the government, reformed the
judiciary, rebuilt the army, encouraged industry, stabilized the
currency, supported literature and art, and collected in the Louvre the
royal library that provided classic texts and translations for the
French Renaissance, and formed the nucleus of the Bibliotheque
Nationale. He yielded to the nobles in restoring feudal tolls, but he
went over their heads to appoint as constable — commander-in-chief of
all French armies — a swarthy, flat-nosed, thick-necked, massive-headed
Breton, Bertrand Du Guesclin. Faith in the superiority of this “Eagle of

<p>tany” to all English generals shared in determining Charles to
undertake the redemption of France from English rule. In 1 369 he sent
Edward III a formal declaration of war.</p>
<p>The Black Prince responded by subduing Limoges and massacring 3,000
men, women, and children; this was his conception of political
education. It proved inadequate; every city in his path fortified,
garrisoned, and provi- sioned itself to successful defense, and the
Prince was reduced to laying waste the open country, burning the crops,
and razing the deserted homes of the peasantry. Du Guesclin refrained
from giving battle, but harassed the princely rear, captured foragers,
and waited for the English troops to starve. They did, and retreated; Du
Guesclin advanced; one by one the ceded prov- inces were reclaimed; and
after two years of remarkable generalship, and the mutual loyalty of
commander and King, the English were driven from all of France except
Bordeaux, Brest, Cherbourg, and Calais; France for the first time
reached to the Pyrenees. Charles and his great constable could die with
honors in the same year (1380) on the crest of victory.</p>
<p>V. THE MAD KING: 1380-1422</p>
<p>The gamble of hereditary monarchy now replaced a competent ruler with
a lovable idiot. Charles VI was twelve when his father died; his uncles
acted as regents till he was twenty, and allowed him to grow up in
irresponsible debauchery while half of Europe marched to the brink of
revolution. In 1 3 59 the workingmen of Bruges, wearing red hats,
stormed the historic hotel de ville in transient revolt. In 1366 the
lower classes of Ypres rose in rebellion, preaching a holy war against
the rich. In 1378 the Ciompi established in Florence the dictatorship of
the proletariat. In 1379 the starving peasants of Languedoc —
south-central France — began six years of guerrilla warfare against
nobles and priests under a leader who gave orders to “kill all who have
soft hands.” 27 Workers revolted in Strasbourg in 1380, in London in
1381, in Cologne in 1396. From 1379 to 1382 a revolutionary government
ruled Ghent. In Rouen a stout draper was crowned king by an uprising of
town laborers; and in Paris the people killed with leaden mallets the
tax col- lectors of the King (1382).</p>
<p>Charles VT took the reins of government in 1388, and for four years
reigned so well that he won the name of Bien-Avme, Well-Beloved. But in
1 392 ne went insane. He could no longer recognize his wife, and begged
the strange woman to cease her importunities. Soon only the humblest
servants paid any attention to him. For five months he had no change of
clothes, and when at last it was decided to bathe him a dozen men were
needed to over- come his reluctance. 28 For thirty years the French
crown was worn by a</p>

<p>pitiful imbecile, while a virile young king prepared to renew the
English attack upon France.</p>
<p>On August it, 141 5, Henry V sailed from England with 1,300 vessels
and</p>
<p>1 1.000 men. On the fourteenth they landed near Harfleur, at the
mouth of the Seine. Harfleur resisted gallantly and in vain. Jubilant
with victory and hurried by dysentery, the English marched toward
Calais. The chivalry of France met them at Agincourt, close to Crecy
(October 25). The French, having learned nothing from Crecy and
Poitiers, still relied on cavalry. Many of their horses were immobilized
by mud; those that advanced met the sharp stakes that the English had
planted at an angle in the ground around their bowmen. The discouraged
horses turned and charged their own army; the English fell upon this
chaotic mass with maces, hatchets, and swords; their King Hal led them
valiantly, too excited for fear; and their victory was overwhelming.
French historians estimate the English loss at 1,600, the French loss at
10,000.</p>
<p>Henry returned to France in 1417, and besieged Rouen. The citizens
ate up their food supply, then their horses, their dogs, their cats. To
save food, women, children, and old men were thrust forth beyond the
city walls; they sought passage through the English lines, were refused,
remained foodless and shelterless between their relatives and their
enemies, and starved to death;</p>
<p>50.000 French died of starvation in that merciless siege. When the
town sur- rendered, Henry restrained his army from massacring the
survivors, but he levied upon them a fine of 300,000 crowns, and kept
them in prison till the total was paid. In 1419 he advanced upon a Paris
in which nothing remained but corruption, destitution, brutality, and
class war. Outdoing the humili- ation of 1360, France, by the Treaty of
Troyes (1420), surrendered every- thing, even honor. Charles VI gave his
daughter Katherine to Henry V in marriage, promised to bequeath to him
the French throne, turned over to him the governance of France, and, to
clear up any ambiguity, disowned the Dauphin as his son. Queen Isabelle,
for an annuity of 24,000 francs, made no defense against this charge of
adultery; and, indeed, in the royal courts of that age it was not easy
for a woman to know who was the father of her child. The Dauphin,
holding south France, repudiated the treaty, and organized his Gascon
and Armagnac bands to carry on the war. But the King of Eng- land
reigned in the Louvre.</p>
<p>Two years later Henry V died of dysentery; the germs had not signed i
the treaty. WTien Charles VI followed him (1422), Henry VI of England ;
was crowned King of France; but as he was not yet a year old, the Duke
of Bedford ruled as his regent. The Duke governed severely, but as
justly as any Englishman could govern France. He suppressed brigandage
by hang- ■ ing 10,000 bandits in a year; judge therefrom the condition
of the land, j</p>

<p>Demobilized soldiers — icor chews (skinners), coquillards (shell men)
— made the highways perilous, and terrorized even large cities like
Paris and Dijon. Over Normandy the ravage of war had passed back and
forth like an in- fernal, murderous tide; even in luckier Languedoc a
third of the population had disappeared. 20 Peasants fled to the cities,
or hid in caves, or fortified themselves in churches, as armies or
feudal factions or robber bands ap- proached. Many peasants never
returned to their precarious holdings, but lived by beggary or thievery,
or died of starvation or plague. Churches, farms, whole towns, were
abandoned and left to decay. In Paris in 1422 there were 24,000 empty
houses, 80,000 beggars, 80 in a population of some 3oo,ooo. 81 People
ate the flesh and entrails of dogs. The cries of hungry chil- dren
haunted the streets.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>LIFE AMONG THE RUINS</li>
</ol>
<p>Morals were such as any country might expect from so long and tragic
a disablement of economy and government. Geoffrey de la Tour-Landry,
about 1372, wrote two books to guide his children in the chaos; only
that which he addressed to his daughters survives. It is a gentle and
tender volume warm with parental love, and disturbed by solicitude for a
virginity espe- cially unstable in a time when many women came through
generous sins to ungenerous contumely. Against such temptations, the
good knight thought, the best protection was frequent prayer. 82 The
book reflects an age still cling- ing to civilized sentiments and moral
sense. Seventy years later we come to the gruesome figure of the
Marechal de Rais or Retz, a great and wealthy lord of Brittany. It was
his custom to invite children into his castle on pre- tense of training
them for the chapel choir; one by one he killed them and offered them in
sacrifice to demons of whom he begged magic powers. But also he killed
for pleasure and (we are told) laughed at the cries of his tor- tured or
dying choristers. For fourteen years he followed this routine, until at
last the father of a victim dared to indict him; he confessed all these
details and was hanged ( 1440), but only because he had offended the
Duke of Brit- tany; men of his rank could seldom be brought to justice
whatever their crimes. 88 Yet the aristocracy to which he belonged
produced heroes in abundance, like King John of Bohemia, or the Gaston
Phoebus de Foix so loved and lauded by Froissart. The final flowers of
chivalry blossomed in this mire.</p>
<p>The morality of the people shared in the common debacle. Cruelty,</p>
<p>treachery, and corruption were endemic. Commoner and governor were
alike open to bribes. Profanity flourished; Chancellor Gerson
complained</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>(chap, in</p>
<p>that the most sacred festivals were passed in card-playing,*
gambling, and blasphemy. 85 Sharpers, forgers, thieves, vagabonds, and
beggars clogged the streets by day, and gathered at night to enjoy their
gleanings, at Paris, in the Cours des Miracles, so called because the
mendicants who had posed as cripples during the day appeared there
marvelously sound in every limb. 86</p>
<p>Sodomy was frequent, prostitution was general, adultery was almost
uni- versal. 87 A sect of “Adamites” in the fourteenth century advocated
nudism, and practiced it in public till the Inquisition suppressed them.
88 Obscene pic- tures were as widely marketed as now; according to
Gerson they were sold even in churches and on holy days. 89 Poets like
Deschamps wrote erotic bal- lads for noble dames. 40 Nicolas de
Clemanges, Archdeacon of Bayeux, de- scribed the convents of his di
strict as “sanctuaries devoted to the cult of Venus.” 11 It was taken as
a matter of course that kings and princes should have mistresses, since
royal — and many noble — marriages were political matches involving, it
was held, no due of love. Highborn ladies continued to hold formal
discussions on the casuistry of sexual relations. Philip the Bold of
Burgundy established a “court of love” in Paris in 1401. 42 Amid or
beneath this moneyed laxity there were presumably some virtuous women
and honest men; we catch a fleeting glimpse of them in a strange book
written about 1 393 by an anonymous sexagenarian known as the Menagier,
or house- holder, of Paris:</p>
<p>I believe that when two good and honorable people are wed, all</p>
<p>loves are put off . . . save only the love of. each for the other.
And</p>
<p>meseems that when they are in each other’s presence they look upon
each other more than upon the others; they clasp and hold each other;
and they do not willingly speak and make signs save to each other.</p>
<p>. . . And all their special pleasure, their chief desire and perfect
joy, is to do pleasure or obedience one to the other. 48</p>
<p>Persecutions of Jews (1306, 1384, 1396) and lepers (1321), trials and
ex- ecutions of animals for injuring or copulating with human beings, 44
public hangings that drew immense crowds of eager spectators, entered
into the picture of the age. In the cemetery of the Church of the
Innocents at Paris so many newly dead sought admission that bodies were
exhumed as soon as the flesh might be expected to have fallen from the
bones; the bones were indiscriminately piled in charnel houses alongside
the cloisters; nevertheless, these cloisters were a popular rendezvous;
shops were set up there, and pros- titutes invited patronage. 45 On a
wall of the cemetery an artist labored for months in 1424 to paint a
Dance of Death, in which demons, pirouetting with men, women, and
children, led them step by merry step to hell. This</p>

<p>became a symbolic theme of a desperate age; a play presented it at
Bruges in 1449; Diirer, Holbein, and Bosch would illustrate it in their
art. Pessimism wrote half the poetry of the period. Deschamps reviled
life in almost all its parts; the world seemed to him like a weak,
timorous, covetous old man, confused and decayed; “all goes badly,” he
concluded. Gerson agreed with him: “We lived in the senility of the
world,” and the Last Judgment was near. An old woman thought that every
twitch of pain in her toes announced another soul heaved into hell. Her
estimate was moderate; according to popular belief no one had entered
paradise in the past thirty years. 48</p>
<p>What did religion do in this collapse of an assaulted nation? In the
first four decades of the Hundred Years’ War the popes, immured at
Avignon, received the protection and commands of the French kings. Much
of the revenues drawn from Europe by the popes of that captivity went to
those kings to finance the struggle of life and death against Britain;
in eleven years (1345-55) Church advanced 3,392,000 florins (4,800,000?)
to the</p>
<p>monarchy. 47 The popes tried again and again to end the war, but
failed. The Church suffered grievously from the century-long devastation
of France; hundreds of churches and monasteries were abandoned or
destroyed; and the lower clergy shared in the demoralization of the age.
Knights and foot- men ignored religion until the hour of battle or
death, and must have felt some qualms of creed at the maddening
indifference of the skies. The people, while breaking all the
commandments, clung fearfully to the Church and the faith; they brought
their pennies and their griefs to the comforting shrines of the Mother
of God; they rose en masse to religious ecstasy at the earnest preaching
of Friar Richard or St. Vincent Ferrer. Some houses had statuettes of
the Virgin so contrived that a touch would open her abdomen and reveal
the Trinity. 48</p>
<p>The intellectual leaders of the Church in this period were mostly
French- men. Pierre d’Ailly was not only one of the most suggestive
scientists of the time; he was among the ablest and most incorruptible
leaders of the Church; and he was one of the ecclesiastical statesmen
who, at the Council of Con- stance, healed the schism in the papacy. As
director of the College of Navarre in Paris he had among his pupils a
youth who became the outstanding theo- logian of his generation. Jean de
Gerson visited the Lowlands, and was much impressed by the mysticism of
Ruysbroeck and the moderna devotio of the Brethren of the Common Life.
When he became chancellor of the Uni- versity of Paris ( 1 395) he
sought to introduce this form of piety into France, even while censuring
the egoism and pantheism of the mystic school. His six sisters were
overcome by his arguments and example, and we are told that they
remained virgins to the end of their lives. Gerson condemned the super-
stitions of the populace, and the quackeries of astrology, magic, and
medi- cine; but he admitted that charms may have efficacy by working
upon the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>(chap. Ill</p>
<p>imagination. Our knowledge of the stars, he thought, is too imperfect
to allow specific predictions; we cannot even reckon a solar year
precisely; we cannot tell the true positions of the stars because their
light is refracted, as it passes down to us, through a variety of
mediums. Gerson advocated a limited democracy, and the supremacy of the
councils, in the Church, but favored a strong monarchy in France;
perhaps his inconsistency was justified by the condition of his country,
which needed order more than liberty. He was a great man in his fashion
and generation; his virtues, as Goethe would have said, were his own
attainment, while his delusions were infections from the age. He led the
movement to depose rival popes and reform the Church; and he shared in
sending John Huss and Jerome of Prague to the stake.</p>
<p>Amid the destitution of their people the upper classes glorified
their per- sons and adorned their homes. Common men wore simple jerkins,
blouses, culottes or trousers, and high boots; the middle classes,
imitating the kings despite sumptuary laws, wore long robes, perhaps
dyed in scarlet or edged with fur; noble lords wore doublets and long
hose, handsome capes, and feathered hats that swept the earth in courtly
bows. Some men wore horns on the toes of their shoes, to correspond with
less visible emblems on their heads. Highborn ladies affected conical
hats like church steeples, straitened themselves in tight jackets and
colorful pantaloons, trailed furry skirts over the floor majestically,
and graciously displayed their bosoms while enhanc- ing their faces with
veils. Buttons were coming into fashion for fastenings, 49 having before
been merely ornaments; we are reversing that movement now. Silks, cloth
of gold, brocade, lace, jewelry in the hair, on neck and hands and dress
and shoes, made even stout women sparkle; and under this protective
brilliance nearly all upper-class women developed a Rubensian
amplitude.</p>
<p>The homes of the poor remained as in former centuries, except that
glass windows were now general. But the villas and town houses (hdtels)
of the rich were no longer gloomy donjons; they were commodious and
well- furnished mansions, with spacious fountained courts, broad winding
stairs, overhanging balconies, and sharply sloping roofs that cut the
sky and sloughed the snow; they were equipped with servants’ rooms,
storerooms, guard room, porter’s room, linen room, laundry, wine cellar,
and bakery, in addition to the great hall and bedrooms of the master’s
family. Some cha - teaux, like those of Pierrefonds ( c . 1390) and
Chateaudun (c. 1450), al- ready presaged the regal castles of the Loire.
Better preserved than any palace of the time is the house of the great
capitalist Jacques Cceur at Bour- ges, a full block long, with Gothic
tower of carved stone, ornate cornices and reliefs, and Renaissance
windows, the whole costing, we are told, some ,000,000 in the money of
today. 90 Interiors were now sumptuously fur- nished: magnificent
fireplaces, which could warm at least one side of a room and its
occupants; sturdy chairs and tables indefatigably carved; cushioned</p>

<p>benches along tapestried walls; gigantic dressers and cupboards
displaying gold and silver plate, and far lovelier glass; thick carpets,
and floors of polished oak or enameled tiles; and high canopied beds
vast enough to hold the lord, his lady, and a child or two. On these
recumbent thrones the men and women of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries slept naked; 61 night- gowns were not yet an indispensable
impediment.</p>

<p>Among the ruins men and women continued to write books. The Pos-
tillae perpetuae (1322-31) of Nicholas of Lyra were major contributions
to the textual understanding of the Bible, and prepared the way for
Erasmus’ New Testament and Luther’s German trans lation. The fiction of
the period favored light erotic tales like the Cent nouvelles nouvelles
— one hundred novel novels — of Antoine de la Salle, or romances of
chivalry like Flore et Blanche fleur. Almost as fictitious was the book
of a Liege physician, Jehan a la Barbe, who called himself Sir John
Mandeville, and published (c. 1370) an account of his alleged travels in
Egypt, Asia, Russia, and Poland. John claimed to have visited all the
places named in the Gospels: “the house where</p>
<p>By far the most brilliant production of French literature in the
fourteenth century was the Chronicles of Jean Froissart. Born at
Valenciennes in 1338, he lapsed into poetry at an early age; and at
twenty-four he crossed to Lon- don to lay his verses at the feet of
Edward Ill’s wife, Philippa of Hainaut. He became her secretary, met
English aristocrats, and admired them too frankly to be impartial in his
history. Lust for travel soon uprooted him, and drew him to Scotland,
Bordeaux, Savoy, and Italy. Returning to Hainaut, he be- came a priest
and canon of Chimay. Now he decided to rewrite his book in prose, and to
extend it at both ends. He traveled again in England and France,</p>

<p>sedulously gathering material. Back in Cliimay he dedicated himself
to fin- ishing “this noble and pleasant his tory . . . which will be
much in request when I am gone … to encourage all valorous hearts, and
to show them hon- orable examples.” 88 No romance could be more
fascinating; he who begins these 1,200 ample pages with intent to leap
from peak to peak will find the valleys inviting too, and will move
gladly and leisurely to the end. This priest, like Julius II, loved
nothing so much as war. He was allured by action, gallantry,
aristocracy; commoners enter his pages only as victims of lordly strife.
He did not inquire into motives; he relied too trustfully on embel-
lished or prejudiced accounts; he made no pretense of adding philosophy
to narrative. He was only a chronicler, but of all chroniclers the
best.</p>
<p>Drama marked time. Mysteries, moralities, “miracles,” interludes, and
farces occupied the stages temporarily erected in the towns. Themes were
increas- ingly secular, and the humor was often scandalous; but
religious subjects still predominated, and the people never tired of
spectacles representing the Pas- sion of Christ. The most famous theater
guild of the time — the Parisian Con - frairie de la Passion de Notre
Seigneur — specialized in acting the story of Christ’s brief stay in
Jerusalem. One such Passion Play, by Amoul Greban, ran to 35,000
lines.</p>
<p>Poetry, too, had its guilds. Toulouse set up in 1323 a Consistori de
la gay a sciensa , or Academy of the Gay Science; under its auspices
public competitions in poetry sought to revive the art and spirit of the
troubadours. Similar literary societies were formed at Amiens, Douai,
and Valenciennes, preparing for the French Academy of Richelieu. Kings
and great lords had poets as well as min- strels and buffoons attached
to their households. Tgl “good Rene,” Duke of Anjou and Lorraine, and
titular King of Naples, supported a bevy of poets and artists at his
courts in Nancy, Tarascon, and Aix-en-Provence, and so rivaled the best
of his rhymers that he received the title of “Last of the Troubadours.”
Charles V took care of Eustache Deschamps, who sang the beauty of women,
married, denounced matrimony in a 1 2,000-line Le Miroir de manage , and
be- moaned the misery and wickedness of his time:</p>

<p>Christine dc Pisan, reared in Paris as the daughter of Charles V’s
Italian physi - cian, was left with three children and three relatives
to support when her husband died; she did it miraculously by writing
exquisite poetry and patriotic history, she deserves a passing obeisance
as the first woman in Western Europe to live by her pen. Alain Chartder
was more fortunate; his love poems — like La belle dame sans mercij
which melodiously chided women for hoarding their charms — so captivated
the aristocracy that a future queen of France, Margaret of Scotland, was
said to have kissed the lips of the poet as he slept on a bench. Etienne
Pasquier, a century later, told the legend charmingly:</p>
<p>When many were astonished at this — for to speak the truth Nature had
placed a beautiful spirit in a most ungraceful body — the lady told them
they must not be surprised at this mystery, for it was not the</p>
<p>man whom she desired to kiss but the lips whence had issued such</p>
<p>golden words. 55</p>
<p>The finest French poet of the age did not have to write poetry, for
he was the nephew of Charles VI and the father of Louis XII. But
Charles, Duke of Orleans, was taken prisoner at Agincourt, and spent
twenty-five years (1415-40) in genteel captivity in England. There,
heavy of heart, he con- soled himself by writing tender verses about the
beauty of women and the tragedy of France. For a time all France sang
his song of spring:</p>
<p>Le temps a laissie son manteau ,</p>
<p>De vent , de froidure, et de pluye ,</p>

<p>Even in England there were pretty girls, and Charles forgot his
griefs when modest loveliness passed by:</p>

<p>Allowed at last to return to France, he made his castle at Blois a

<p>been weakened or destroyed by the extension of royal authority, and
the enlargement of the economy from a local to a national frame. The
French Church could no longer finance or inspire such stupendous
structures as had risen in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from the
soil of France. Faith as well as wealth had declined; the hope that in
those centuries had under- taken at once the Crusades and the cathedrals
— the enterprise and its prayer — had lost its generative ecstasy. It
was more than the fourteenth century could do to finish, in
architecture, what a more sanguine era had begun. Even so, Jean Ravi
completed Notre Dame in Paris (1351), Rouen added a “Lady Chapel” (1302)
to a cathedral already dedicated to Our Lady, and Poitiers gave her
cathedral its proud west front (1379).</p>
<p>The Rayonnant style of Gothic design was now (1275 f.) gradually</p>
<p>yielding to a Geometrical Gothic that stressed Euclidean figures
instead of radiating lines. In this manner Bordeaux built her cathedral
(1320-25), Caen raised a handsome spire (shattered in the second World
War) on the church of St. Pierre (1308), Auxerre gave her cathedral a
new nave (1335), Coutances (1371-86) and Amiens (1375) added lovely
chapels to their his- toric shrines, and Rouen enhanced her
architectural glory with the noble church of St. Ouen (1318-1545).</p>
<p>In the final quarter of the fourteenth century, when France thought
her- self victorious, her architects displayed a new Gothic, joyous in
spirit, ex- uberant in carved detail, fancifully intricate in tracery,
reveling recklessly in ornament. The ogive, or pointed arch of a
continued curve, became now an ogee, or tapered arch of a reversed
curve, like the tongue of flame that gave the style its Flamboyant name.
Capitals fell into disuse; columns were fluted or spiraled; choir stalls
were profusely carved, and were closed with iron screens of delicate
lacery; pendentives became stalactites; vaults were a wilderness of
intertwined, disappearing, reappearing ribs; the mullions of the windows
shunned the old solid geometrical forms, and flowed in charm- ing
frailty and incalculable willfulness; spires seemed built of decoration;
structure vanished behind ornament. The new style made its debut in the
chapel of St. Jean-Baptiste ( 1 375) in the cathedral of Amiens; by 1425
it had captured France; in 1436 it began one of its fragile miracles,
the church of St. Maclou at Rouen. Perhaps the revival of French courage
and arms by Joan of Arc and Charles VII, the growth of mercantile wealth
as instanced by Jacques Coeur, and the inclination of the rising
bourgeoisie to luxurious ornament helped the Flamboyant style to its
triumph in the first half of the fifteenth century. In that feminine
form Gothic survived till French kings and nobles brought back from
their wars in Italy the classical architectural ideas of the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>The growth of civil architecture revealed the rising secularism of
the time. Kings and dukes thought there were churches enough, and built
them-</p>
<p>80 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>selves palaces to impress the people and house their mistresses; rich
burghers spent fortunes on their homes; municipalities announced their
wealth through splendid hdtels-de- ville, or city halls. Some hospitals,
like Beaune’s, were designed with a fresh and airy beauty that must have
lulled the ill to health. At Avignon the popes and cardinals gathered
and nourished a diver- sity of artists; but the builders, painters, and
sculptors of France were now usually grouped about a noble or a king.
Charles V built the chateau of Vincennes (1364-73) and the Bastille
(1369), and commissioned the versa- tile Andre Beauneveu to carve
figures of Philip VI, John II, and Charles himself for the imposing
array of royal tombs that crowd the ambulatory and crypt of St. Denis
(1364). Louis of Orleans raised the chateau of Pierre- fonds, and John,
Duke of Berry, though hard on his peasants, was one of the great art
patrons of history.</p>
<p>For him Beauneveu illustrated a Psalter in 1402. It was but one in
a</p>
<p>series of illuminated manuscripts that stand near the top in what
might be called the chamber music of the graphic arts. For the same
discriminating lord, Jacquemart de Hesdin painted Les petites heures,
Les belles heures, and Les grandes heures, all illustrating books of
“hours” for the canonical daily prayers. Again for Duke John the
brothers Pol, Jehannequin, and Herman Malouel of Limburg produced Les
tres riches heures (1416) — sixty-five delicately beautiful miniatures
picturing the life and scenery of France: nobles hunting, peasants
working, a countryside purified with snow. These Very Rich Hours, now
hidden even from tourist eyes in the Conde Mu- seum at Chantilly, and
the miniatures made for Le bon roi, Rene of Anjou, were almost the last
triumphs of illumination; for in the fifteenth century that art was
challenged both by wood-block engraving and by the develop- ment of
thriving schools of mural and easel painting at Fontainebleau, Amiens,
Bourges, Tours, Moulins, Avignon, and Dijon, not to speak of the masters
who worked for the dukes of Burgundy. Beauneveu and the Van Eycks
brought Flemish styles of painting to France; and through Simone Martini
and other Italians at Avignon, and the Angevin rule in Naples
(1268-1435), Italian art influenced the French long before French arms
invaded Italy. By 1450 French painting stood on its own feet, and marked
its coming of age with the anonymous Piet a of Villeneuve, now in the
Louvre.</p>
<p>Jean Fouquet is the first clear personality in French painting. Born
at Tours (1416), he studied for seven years in Italy (1440-47), and
returned to France with that predilection for classical architectural
backgrounds which in the seventeenth century would become a mania with
Nicolas Pous- sin and Claude Lorrain. Nevertheless he painted several
portraits that are powerful revelations of character: Archbishop Juvenal
des Ursins, Chancel- lor of France — stout and stern and resolute, and
not too pious for statesman-</p>

<p>ship; Etienne Chevalier, treasurer of the realm — a melancholy man
troubled by the impossibility of raising money as fast as a government
can spend it; Charles VII himself, after Agnes Sorel had made a man of
him; and Agnes in the rosy flesh, transformed by Fouquet into a cold and
stately Virgin with downcast eyes and uplifted breast. For Chevalier,
Jean illuminated a Book of Hours, brightening the tedium of ritual
prayer with almost fragrant scenes from the valley of the Loire. An
enameled medallion in the Louvre preserves Fouquet as he saw himself —
no princely Raphael riding high, but a simple artisan of the brush,
dressed for work, eager and diffident, worried and resolved, bearing the
mark of a century of poverty on his brow. How- ever, he passed without
mishap from one reign to another, and rose at last to be peintre du rot
for the incalculable Louis XI. After many years of labor comes success,
and soon thereafter death.</p>
<ol start="9" type="i">
<li>joan of arc: 1412-31</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1422 the repudiated son of Charles VI had himself proclaimed king
as Charles VII. In her desolation France looked to him for help, and
fell intQ deeper despair. This timid, listless, heedless youth of twenty
hardly credited his own proclamation, and probably shared the doubts of
Frenchmen as to the legitimacy of his birth. Fouquet’s portrait of him
shows a sad and homely face, pockets under the eyes, and an overreaching
nose. He was fearfully religious, heard three Masses daily, and allowed
no canonical hour to pass without reciting its appointed prayers. In the
intervals he attended to a long succession of mistresses, and begot
twelve children upon his virtuous wife. He pawned his jewels, and most
of the clothes from his back, to finance re- sistance to England, but he
had no stomach for war, and left the struggle to his ministers and his
generals. Neither were they enthusiastic or alert; they quarreled
jealously among themselves — all but the faithful Jean Dunois, the
natural son of Louis, Duke of Orleans. When the English moved south to
lay siege to that city ( 1428), no concerted action was taken to resist
them, and disorder was the order of the day. Orleans lay at a bend in
the Loire; if it fell, all the south, now hesitantly loyal to Charles
VII, would join the north to make France an English colony. North and
south alike watched the siege, and prayed for a miracle.</p>
<p>Even the distant village of Domremy, half asleep by the Meuse on the
eastern border of France, followed the struggle with patriotic and
religious passion. The peasants there were fully medieval in faith and
sentiment; they lived from nature but in the supernatural; they were
sure that spirits dwelled in the surrounding air, and many women vowed
that they had seen and talked with them. Men as well as women there, as
generally throughout rural</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>France, thought of the English as devils who hid their tails in their
coattails. Someday, said a prophecy current in the village, God would
send a pucelle, a virgin maid, to save France from these demons, and end
the long Satanic reign of war. 60 The wife of the mayor of Domremy
whispered these hopes to her goddaughter Joan.</p>
<p>Joan’s father, Jacques d’Arc, was a prosperous farmer, and probably
gave no mind to such tales. Joan was noted among these pious people for
her piety; she was fond of going to church, confessed regularly and
fervently, and busied herself with parochial charities. In her little
garden the fowls and the birds ate from her hand. One day, when she had
been fasting, she thought she saw a strange light over her head, and
that she heard a voice saying, “Jeanne, be a good obedient child. Go
often to church.” 61 She was then ( 1424) in her thirteenth year;
perhaps some physiological changes mys- tified her at this most
impressionable time. During the next five years her “voices”— as she
called the apparitions — spoke many counsels to her, until at last it
seemed to her that the Archangel Michael himself commanded her: “Go to
the succor of the King of France, and thou shalt restore his king- dom
Go to M. Baudricourt, captain at Vaucouleurs, and he will conduct</p>
<p>thee to the King.” And at another time the voice said: “Daughter of
God, thou shalt lead the Dauphin to Reims that he may there receive
worthily his anointing” and coronation. For until Charles should be
anointed by the Church, France would doubt his divine right to rule; but
if the holy oil should be poured upon his head France would unite behind
him and be saved.</p>
<p>After a long and troubled hesitation Joan revealed her visions to her
par- ents. Her father was shocked at the thought of an innocent girl
undertaking so fantastic a mission; rather than permit it, he said, he
would drown her with his own hands. 62 To further restrain her he
persuaded a young villager to announce that she had promised him her
hand in marriage. She denied it; and to preserve the virginity that she
had pledged to her saints, as well as to obey their command, she fled to
an uncle, and prevailed upon him to take her to Vaucouleurs (1429).
There Captain Baudricourt advised the uncle to give the
seventeen-year-old girl a good spanking, and to restore her to her
parents; but when Joan forced her way into his presence, and firmly
declared that she had been sent by God to help King Charles save
Orleans, the bluff commandant melted, and, even while thinking her
charmed by devils, sent to Chinon to ask the King’s pleasure. Royal
permission came; Baudricourt gave the Maid a sword, the people of
Vaucouleurs bought her a horse, and six soldiers agreed to guide her on
the long and perilous journey across France to Chinon. Perhaps to
discourage male advances, to facilitate riding, and to win acceptance by
generals and troops, she donned a mascu- line and military garb —
jerkin, doublet, hose, gaiters, spurs — and cut her hair</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill) FRANCE BESIEGED 83</p>
<p>like a boy’s. She rode serene and confident through towns that
vacillated between fearing her as a witch and worshiping her as a
saint.</p>
<p>After traveling 450 miles in eleven days she came to the King and his
council. Though his poor raiment gave no sign of royalty, Joan (we are
told — for how could legend keep its hands from her history?) singled
him out at once, and greeted him courteously: “God send you long life,
gentle Dauphin. . . . My name is Jeanne la Pucelle. The King of Heaven
speaks to you through me, and says that you shall be anointed and
crowned at Reims, and be lieutenant of the King of Heaven, who is King
of France.” A priest who now became the Maid’s chaplain said later that
in private she assured the King of his legitimate birth. Some have
thought that from her first meet- ing with Charles she accepted the
clergy as the rightful interpreters of her voices, and followed their
lead in her counsel to the King; through her the bishops might displace
the generals in forming the royal policies. 63 Still doubtful, Charles
sent her to Poitiers to be examined by pundits there. They found no evil
in her. They commissioned some women to inquire into her virginity, and
on that delicate point too they were satisfied. For, like the Maid, they
held that a special privilege belonged to virgins as the instruments and
messengers of God.</p>
<p>Dunois, in Orleans, had assured the garrison that God would soon send
someone to their aid. Hearing of Joan, he half believed his hopes, and
pleaded with the court to send her to him at once. They consented, gave
her a black horse, clothed her in white armor, put in her hand a white
banner embroid- ered with the fleur-de-lis of France, and dispatched her
to Dunois with a numerous escort bearing provisions for the besieged. It
was not hard to find entry to the city (April 29, 1429); the English had
not surrounded it en- tirely, but had divided their two or three
thousand men (less than the Orleans garrison) among a dozen forts at
strategic points in the environs. The people of Orleans hailed Joan as
the Virgin incarnate, followed her trust- fully even into dangerous
places, accompanied her to church, prayed when she prayed, wept when she
wept. At her command the soldiers gave up their mistresses, and
struggled to express themselves without profanity; one of their leaders,
La Hire, found this impossible, and received from Joan a dis- pensation
to swear by his baton. It was this Gascon condottiere who uttered the
famous prayer: “Sire God, I beg Thee to do for La Hire what he would do
for Thee wert Thou a captain and La Hire were God.” 64</p>
<p>Joan sent a letter to Talbot, the English commander, proposing that
both armies should unite as brothers and proceed to Palestine to redeem
the Holy Land from the Turks; Talbot thought that this exceeded his
commission. Some days later a part of the garrison, without informing
Dunois or Joan, issued beyond the walls and attacked one of the British
bastions. The English fought well, the French retreated; but Dunois and
Joan, having heard the</p>
<p>84 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>commotion, rode up and bade their men renew the assault; it
succeeded, and the English abandoned their position. On the morrow the
French attacked two other forts and took them, the Maid being in the
thick of the fight. In the second encounter an arrow pierced her
shoulder; when the wound had been dressed she returned to the fray.
Meanwhile the sturdy cannon of Guillaume Duisy hurled upon the English
fortress of Les Tourelles balls weighing 120 pounds each. Joan was
spared the sight of the victorious French slaughtering 500 Englishmen
when that stronghold fell. Talbot con- cluded that his forces were
inadequate for the siege, and withdrew them to the north (May 8) . All
France rej oiced, seeing in the “Maid of Orleans” the hand of God; but
the English denounced her as a sorceress, and vowed to take her alive or
dead.</p>
<p>On the day after her triumph Joan set out to meet the King, who was
advancing from Chinon. He greeted her with a kiss, and accepted her plan
to march through France to Reims, though this meant passing through
hostile terrain. His army encountered English forces at Meung,
Beaugency, and Patay, and won decisive victories, tarnished with
vengeful massacres that horrified the Maid. Seeing a French soldier slay
an English prisoner, she dismounted, held the dying man’s head in her
hands, comforted him, and sent for a confessor. On July 15 the King
entered Reims, and on the seven- teenth he was anointed and crowned with
awesome ceremonies in the majestic cathedral. Jacques d’Arc, coming up
from Domremy, saw his daughter, still in her male attire, riding in
splendor through the religious capital of France. He did not neglect the
occasion, but through her inter- cession secured a remission of taxes
for his village. For a passing spell Joan considered her mission
accomplished, and thought, “If it would please God that I might go and
tend sheep with my sister and brother.” 65</p>
<p>But the fever of battle had entered her blood. Acclaimed as inspired
and holy by half of France, she almost forgot now to be a saint, and
became a warrior. She was strict with her soldiers, scolded them
lovingly, and de- prived them of the consolations that all soldiers hold
as their due; and when she found two prostitutes accompanying them she
drew her sword and struck one so manfully that the blade broke and the
woman died. 60 She fol- lowed the King and his army in an attack upon
Paris, which was still held by the English; she was in the van in
clearing the first foss; approaching the second, she was struck in the
thigh by an arrow, but remained to cheer on the troops. Their assault
failed, they suffered 1 ,500 casualties, and cursed her for thinking
that a prayer could silence a gun; this had not been their ex- perience.
Some Frenchwomen, who had jealously waited for her first re- verse,
censured her for leading an assault on the feast of the Virgin’s birth
(September 8, 1429). She retired with her detachment to Compiegne. Be-
sieged there by Burgundians allied with the English, she bravely led a
sally.</p>
<p>FRANCE BESIEGED</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>which was repulsed; she was the last to retreat, and found the gates
of the town closed before she could reach them. She was dragged from her
horse, and was taken as a captive to John of Luxembourg (May 24, 1430).
Sir John lodged her honorably in his castles at Beaulieu and
Beaurevoir.</p>
<p>His good fortune brought him a dangerous dilemma. His sovereign, Duke
Philip the Good of Burgundy, demanded the precious prize; the English
urged Sir John to surrender her to them, hoping that her ignominious
exe- cution would break the charm that had so heartened the French.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who had been driven from his diocese
for supporting the English, was sent by them to Philip with powers and
funds to negotiate the transfer of the Maid to British authority, and
was promised the archbishopric of Rouen as the reward of his success.
The Duke of Bed- ford, controlling the University of Paris, induced its
pundits to advise Philip to hand over Joan, as a possible sorceress and
heretic, to Cauchon as the ecclesiastical head of the region in which
she had been captured. When these arguments were rejected, Cauchon
offered to Philip and John a bribe of 10,000 gold crowns (50,000?). This
too proving inadequate, the Eng- lish government laid an embargo on all
exports to the Low Countries. Flan- ders, the richest source of the
Duke’s revenue, faced ba nkruptcy. John, over the entreaties of his
wife, and Philip, despite his Good name, finally accepted the bribe and
surrendered the Maid to Cauchon, who took her to Rouen. There, though
formally a prisoner of the Inquisition, she was placed under English
guard in the tower of a castle held by the Earl of Warwick as the
governor of Rouen. Shackles were put on her feet, and a chain was
fastened around her waist and bound to a beam.</p>
<p>Her trial began on February 2 1 , 143 1, and continued till May 30.
Cauchon presided, one of his canons served as prosecutor, a Dominican
monk repre- sented the Inquisition, and some forty men learned in
theology and law were added to the panel. The charge was heresy. To
check the monstrous regi- ment of magic-mongers that infested Europe,
the Church had made the claim to divine inspiration a heresy punishable
with death. Witches were being burned for pretending to supernatural
powers; and it was a common opinion, among churchmen and laymen, that
those who made such claims might actually have received supernatural
powers from the Devil. Some of Joan’s jurors seem to have believed this
in her case. In their judgment her refusal to acknowledge that the
authority of the Church, as the vicar of Christ on earth, could override
that of her “voices” proved her a sorceress. This became the opinion of
the majority of the court. 67 Nevertheless they were moved by the
guileless simplicity of her answers, by her evident piety and chastity;
they were men, and seem at times to have felt a great pity for this girl
of nineteen, so obviously the prey of English fear. “The king of
England,” said Warwick, with soldierly candor, “has paid dearly for

<p>he would not on any consideration whatever have her die a natural
death.” 68 Some jurors argued that the matter should be laid before the
pope — which would free her and the court from English power. Joan
expressed a desire to be sent to him, but drew a firm distinction that
ruined her: she would acknowledge his supreme authority in matters of
faith, but as concerned what she had done in obedience to her voices she
would own no judge but God Himself. The judges agreed that this was
heresy. Weakened by months of questioning, she was persuaded to sign a
retraction; but when she found that this still left her condemned to
lifelong imprisonment within English jurisdiction, she revoked her
retraction. English soldiers surrounded the court, and threatened the
lives of the judges if the Maid should escape burn- ing. On May 3 1 a
few of the judges convened, and sentenced her to death.</p>
<p>That very morning the faggots were piled high in the market place of
Rouen. Two platforms were placed near by — one for Cardinal Winchester
of England and his prelates, another for Cauchon and the judges; and 800
British troops stood on guard. The Maid was brought in on a cart, accom-
panied by an Augustinian monk, Isambart, who befriended her to the last,
at peril to his life. She asked for a crucifix; an English soldier
handed her one that he had fashioned from two sticks; she accepted it,
but called also for a crucifix blessed by the Church; and Isambart
prevailed upon the officials to bring her one from the church of Saint
Sauveur. The soldiers grumbled at the delay, for it was now noon. “Do
you intend us to dine here?” their cap - tain asked. His men snatched
her from the hands of the priests, and led her to the stake. Isambart
held up a crucifix before her, and a Dominican monk mounted the pyre
with her. The faggots were lighted, and the flames rose about her feet.
Seeing the Dominican still beside her, she urged him to de- scend to
safety. She invoked her voices, her saints, the Archangel Michael, and
Christ, and was consumed in agony. A secretary to the English king
anticipated the verdict of history: “We are lost,” he cried; “we have
burned a saint.”</p>
<p>In 1455 Pope Calixtus III, at the behest of Charles VII, ordered a
re-</p>
<p>examination of the evidence upon which Joan had been condemned; and
in 1456 (France being now victorious) the verdict of 143 1 was, by the
ecclesi- astical court of review, declared unjust and void. In 1920
Benedict XV numbered the Maid of Orleans among the saints of the
Church.</p>
<p>X. FRANCE SURVIVES: I43I-53</p>
<p>We must not exaggerate the military importance of Joan of Arc;
probably Dunois and La Hire would have saved Orleans without her; her
tactics of reckless assault won some battles and lost others; and
England was feeling</p>
<p>FRANCE BESIEGED</p>

<p>the cost of a Hundred Years’ War. In 1435 Philip of Burgundy,
England’s ally, tired of the struggle and made a separate peace with
France. His defec- tion weakened the hold of the English on the
conquered cities of the south; one by one these expelled their alien
garrisons. In 1436 Paris itself, for seven- teen years a captive, drove
out the British, and Charles VII at last ruled in his capital.</p>
<p>Strange to tell, he who had for so long been a do-nothing shadow of a
king, had learned by this time to govern — to choose competent
ministers, to reorganize the army, to discipline turbulent barons, to do
whatever was needed to make his country free. What had wrought this
transformation? The inspiration of Joan had begun it, but how weak he
still seemed when he raised not a finger to save her! His remarkable
mother-in-law, Yolande of Anjou, had helped him with wise counsel, had
encouraged him to receive and support the Maid. Now — if we may trust
tradition — she gave her son- in-law the mistress who for ten years
ruled the heart of the King.</p>
<p>Agnes Sorel was the daughter of a squire in Touraine. Orphaned in
child- hood, she had been brought up to good manners by Isabelle,
Duchess of Lorraine. Isabelle took her, then twenty-three, to visit the
court in Chinon (1432) in the year after Joan’s death. Snared in the
girl’s chestnut tresses, and in love with her laughter, Charles marked
her out as his own. Yolande found her tractable, hoped to use her in
influencing the King, and persuaded Marie, her daughter, to accept this
latest of her husband’s mistresses. 69 Agnes remained till death
faithful in this infidelity, and a later king, Francis I, after much
experience in such matters, praised the “Lady of Beauty” as having
served France better than any cloistered nun. Charles “relished wis -
dom from such lips”; he allowed Agnes to shame him out of indolence and
cowardice into industry and resolution. He gathered about him able men
like Constable Richemont, who led his armies, and Jacques Coeur, who re-
stored the finances of the state, and Jean Bureau, whose artillery
brought recalcitrant nobles to heel and sent the English scurrying to
Calais.</p>
<p>Jacques Coeur was a condottiere of commerce; a man of no pedigree and
little schooling, who, however, could count well; a Frenchman who dared
to compete successfully with Venetians, Genoese, and Catalans in trade
with the Moslem East. He owned and equipped seven merchant vessels,
manned them by hiring convicts and snatching vagrants from the streets,
and sailed his ships under the flag of che Mother of God. He amassed the
greatest fortune of his time in France, some 27,000,000 francs, when a
franc was worth some five dollars in the emaciated currency of our day.
In 1436 Charles gave him charge of the mint, soon afterward of the
revenues and expenditures of the government. A States-General of 1439,
enthusi- as tically supporting Charles’s resolve to drive the English
from French soil, empowered the King, by a famous succession of
ordonnances ( 1443-47), to</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap, m</p>
<p>take the whole taille of France — i.e., all taxes hitherto paid by
tenants to j their feudal lords; the government’s revenue now rose to
1,800,000 crowns (5,000,000? ) a year. From that time onward the French
monarchy, unlike the English, was independent of the Estates’ “power of
the purse,” and j could resist the growth of a middle-class democracy.
This system of na- j tional taxation provided the funds for the victory
of France over England; j but as the King could raise the rate of
assessment, it became a major tool of royal oppression, and shared in
causing the Revolution of 1789. Jacques Cceur played a leading role in
these fiscal developments, earning the admira- tion of many and the
hatred of a powerful few. In 145 1 he was arrested on a charge — never
proved — of hiring agents to poison Agnes Sorel. He was con- demned and
banished, and all his property was confiscated to the state — an elegant
method of exploitation by proxy. He fled to Rome, where he was made
admiral of a papal fleet sent to the relief of Rhodes. He was taken ill
at Chios, and died there in 1456, aged sixty-one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Charles VII, guided by Cmur, had established an honest
coin- age, rebuilt the shattered villages, promoted industry and
commerce, and restored the economic vitality of France. He compelled the
disbandment of private companies of soldiers, and gathered these into
his service to form the first standing army in Europe ( 1439). He
decreed that in every parish some virile citizen, chosen by his fellows,
should be freed from all taxation, should arm himself, practice the use
of weapons, and be ready at any moment to join his like in the military
service of the King. It was these francs-tireurs, or free bowmen, who
drove the English from France.</p>

<li>The English were surprised and shocked. They were weakened by
internal quarrels, and found their fading empire in France relatively as
ex- pensive to maintain in the fifteenth century as India in the
twentieth; in 1427 France cost England £68,000, brought her £57,000. The
British fought bravely but not wisely; they relied too long on archers
and stakes, and the tactics that had stopped the French cavalry at Crecy
and Poitiers proved helpless at Formigny (1450) against the cannon of
Bureau. In 1449 the English evacuated most of Normandy; in 1451 they
abandoned its capi- tal, Rouen. In 1453 the great Talbot himself was
defeated and killed at Castillon; Bordeaux surrendered; all Guienne was
French again; the Eng- lish kept only Calais. On October 19, 1453, the
two nations signed the peace that ended the Hundred Years’ War.</li>
