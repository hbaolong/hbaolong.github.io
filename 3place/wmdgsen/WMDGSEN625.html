<h4 id="chapter-xxx-the-german-people">CHAPTER XXX The German
People</h4>
<p>1789 — 1812</p>
<p>I. ECONOMICS</p>
<p>T HE Germans of 1800 were a class-conscious people, accepting class
division as a system of social order and economic organization; and</p>
<p>rare was the man who acquired a noble title except by birth. “In
Germany,” noted Mme. de Stael, “everybody keeps his rank, his place in
society, as if it were his established post.” 1 This was less so along
the Rhine and among uni - versity graduates, but in general the Germans
were a more patient people than the French. Not till 1848 did they reach
their 1789.</p>
<p>The influence of the French Revolution was exciting in literature,
slight in industry. Germany had rich natural resources, but the
persistence of feudalism, and the power of feudal barons, in the central
and eastern states, slowed the rise of a business and manufacturing
class that might have been stimulated by a free and classless economy to
apply to industry the coal and metals lying abundantly in the soil.
Commerce was helped by magnificent rivers — the Rhine, the Weser, the
Elbe, the Saale, the Main, the Spree, the Oder; but the fragmentation of
states kept roads short and few and poor, and on these there were
brigands and feudal tolls. Commerce was hindered by guild regulations,
high taxes, and the geographical diversity of measures, weights,
coinages, and laws.</p>
<p>German industry, till 1807, had to meet the competition of British
goods produced by the latest machinery; England enjoyed a generation of
priority in the Industrial Revolution, and it forbade the export of its
new technology, or its skilled technicians. 2 The double-faced god of
war, breeding industries to feed and clothe and kill men, nourished
national economies; and after 1 806 the Continental Blockade, more or
less excluding British goods, helped the mainland industries to grow.
Mining and metallurgy developed in west- ern Germany, especially in or
near Diisseldorf and Essen. At Essen in 1810 Friedrich Krupp (1787-1826)
began the complex of metal works that would arm Germany for a
century.</p>
<p>Despite such figures the entrepreneur was looked down upon by noble
and king as a potential profiteer, and no merchant or manufacturer was
al- lowed to marry into the nobility, or to buy a feudal estate.
Financiers — Huguenot, Jewish, or other — were allowed to lend to
nobility or royalty, but when (1810) they proposed that Prussia imitate
England and France</p>
<p>600</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE GERMAN PEOPLE</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>and establish a national bank, issue government securities at a low
interest, and so let a public debt help to finance the state, the King
agreed with the nobles that such a procedure would put the kingdom at
the mercy of the bankers. Prussia rejected control of the nation by the
managers of capital, and chose rather to be led by a military caste and
a Junker aristocracy.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>BELIEVERS AND DOUBTERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Germany was still religiously divided as in the Thirty Years’ War;
and in many ways the wars of Frederick the Great with Austria and France
were replays of that prolonged tragedy. If Frederick had lost,
Protestantism might have disappeared from Prussia as it had disappeared
from Huss’s Bohemia after 1620.</p>
<p>As the Protestant clergy took over the property of the Catholic
bishops in the Protestant north, they became dependent upon military
protection by the Protestant princes, and acknowledged them as the heads
of the Protes- tant Church in their realms; so the agnostic Frederick
was the head of the Prussian Church. In the Catholic states — Austria,
Bohemia, and nearly all the Confederation of the Rhine — the bishops, if
not themselves rulers, needed similar protection, and fell into
subservience to the civil power; many of them paid little attention to
papal pronouncements, but most of them regu- larly read from their
pulpits the decrees of the civil authorities that pro- tected them; so,
in Napoleon’s German states the bishops— Protestant or Catholic — read
from their pulpits his administrative orders and his military bulletins.
3</p>
<p>This subjection of the Church had diverse — almost contradictory —
effects: Pietism and rationalism. There were many German families that
had tradi- tions of a piety stronger than politics and deeper than
ritual; they found more inspiration in family prayers than in pulpit
eloquence or professional theology. More and more they neglected the
churches, and practiced their devotions in esoteric groups private and
intense. Even more fervent was a proud cluster of mystics who cherished
the traditions of seers like Jakob Bohme, and claimed or sought to see
God face to face, and to have experi- enced illuminations that had
dissolved the deepest, bitterest, problems of life. Especially
impressive, if only by having borne with silent heroism cen- turies of
persecution, were the uncloistered, unvowed monks and nuns of the
Moravian Brotherhood, who, banished from Catholic Bohemia, spread
through Protestant Germany, and profoundly affected its religious life.
Mme. de Stael met some of them, and was impressed by their premarital
chastity, their sharing of goods, and the epitaph chosen for each of
their dead: “He was born on such a day, and on such a day he returned to
his native country.” 4 Baroness Julie (Barbara Juliane) von Kriidener
(1764 -</p>
<p>1824), Mme. de Stael’s favorite mystic, was committed to their creed,
and preached it so charmingly that Queen Louise of Prussia — and, for a
time,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXCzar Alexander of Russia — fell under her influence, barring the
sharing of goods.</p>
<p>Antipodal to the mystics were the skeptics who had inhaled the winds
of the French Enlightenment. Lessing had let loose the German Aufklarung
by exhuming and partly publishing the Fragmente eines TJngenannten
(1774-78) in which Hermann Reimarus had expressed his doubts about the
historicity of the Gospels. Of course there had been skeptics in every
gen- eration, but most of them had found silence golden, and the
infection had been controlled by hellfire and police. But now it had
found its way into the Freemason and Rosicrucian lodges, into the
universities, and even into the monasteries. In 1781 Kant’s Critique of
Pure Reason turned educated</p>
<p>Such reports were emotionally exaggerated. Religious doubt affected a
few professors and some sophomores, but it hardly touched the German
masses. The Christian creed continued to appeal to the sense of man’s de
- pendence upon supersensual powers, and to the propensity of even the
learned to ask for supernatural aid. The Protestant congregations warmed
their own hearts with mighty hymns. The Catholic Church continued to
offer a home to miracle, myth, mystery, music, and art, and a final port
for spirits exhausted by years of intellectual navigation amid the
storms and shoals of philosophy and sex; so erudite scholars like
Friedrich von Schlegel, brilliant Jewesses like Moses Mendelssohn’s
daughters, sought at last the uterine warmth of the Mother Church. Faith
always recovers, and doubt remains.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE GERMAN JEWS</li>
</ol>
<p>Faith must have weakened, for toleration grew. As knowledge rose it
flowed over the fences within which the creeds had preserved their inno-
cence. It became impossible for an educated Christian to hate a modern
Jew because of a political crucifixion eighteen centuries ago; and
perhaps he had read, in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (xxi, 8), how a
multitude of Jews had strewn with palm leaves the path of the beloved
preacher as he entered Jerusalem a few days before his death. In any
case the Jews in Austria were</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE GERMAN PEOPLE</p>
<p>603</p>
<p>freed by Joseph II, in the Rhineland by the Revolution or Napoleon,
and in Prussia by Hardenberg. They came gladly out of the ghettos, took
on the dress, language, and habits of their times and place, became able
workers, loyal citizens, devoted scholars, creative scientists.
Anti-Semitism remained among the unlettered, but in the literate it lost
its religious aura, and had to feed on economic and intellectual
rivalries, and on ghetto ways lingering vestigially among the struggling
poor.</p>
<p>In Goethe’s Frankfurt hostility between Christian and Jew had been es
- pecially strong, and survived longer, because the ruling bourgeoisie
there felt the vigor of Jewish competition in commerce and finance.
Living quietly among them was Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812), who
was found- ing the greatest banking house in history by lending to
impecunious princes like the landgraves of Hesse-Cas sel, or serving as
one of England’s agents in subsidizing the challenged kings in their
struggle against Napoleon. Never- theless it was Napoleon who in 1810
insisted on applying to the Jews of Frankfurt the full freedom
guaranteed by the Code Napoleon. 7</p>
<p>Marcus Herz (i’7 47-1 803) came to personify the flowering of Jewish
finance into the pursuit and patronage of the sciences and the arts. Bom
in Berlin, he migrated in 1762 to Konigsberg, where Kant and other
liberals had prevailed upon the university to admit Jews. Herz enrolled
as a medical student, but he attended Kant’s lectures almost as often as
the courses in medicine, and his passionate interest in philosophy made
him Kant’s favorite pupil. 8 Graduating in medicine, he moved back to
Berlin, and soon won repute not only as a physician but as well by his
lectures on philosophy. His discourses and demonstrations in physics
drew a distinguished audience, in- cluding the future King Frederick
William III.</p>
<p>His life was both brightened and saddened by his marriage to
Henrietta de Lemos, one of the fairest women of her time. She made his
home a salon rivaling the best in Paris. She extended her hospitality to
other Jewish beau- ties, including Moses Mendelssohn’s daughter Brendel—
later Dorothea — and Rachel Levin, wife-to-be of the diplomat-author
Vamhagen von Ense. Christian as well as Jewish notables gathered around
these three Graces, and the Christians were delighted to find that they
had minds as well as bodies, and were alluringly venturesome. Mirabeau
attended these gatherings to dis- cuss politics with Marcus, and more
frequently to ponder subtler subjects with Henrietta. She relished the
admiration offered by Christian notables, and fell into “ambiguous
relations” with Wilhelm von Humboldt the educa - tor, then with
Friedrich Schleiermacher the philosophic preacher. Mean- while she
encouraged Dorothea — who had married Simon Veit and given him two
children — to leave her husband and home and live with Friedrich von
Schlegel, first as his mistress and then as his wife.</p>
<p>So the free mingling of Jews and Christians had a double dissolving
effect: it weakened the faith of Christians when they found that Christ
and his twelve Apostles had intended their religion to be a reform
Judaism faithful to the Temple and the Mosaic Code; and it weakened the
faith of Jews who</p>
<p>604</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXsaw that fidelity to Judaism could be a severe handicap in the
pursuit of mates and place. In both camps the decline of religious
belief eroded the moral code.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>MORALS</li>
</ol>
<p>The code had rested upon belief in a god good and terrible,
encouraging every humble appeal, watching every act and thought of every
soul, forget- ting nothing, and never abdicating the right and power to
judge and punish or forgive, a god of love and vengeance, master, in his
medieval form, of</p>
<p>heaven and hell. This somber and perhaps indispensable creed still
survived among the masses, and helped the clergy, the Junkers, the
generals, and the patres familias to manage their flocks, peasants,
troops, and homes. Periodic war, commercial competition, and the need
for family discipline required the formation of habits of obedience and
application in the youth, of winsome modesty and domestic arts in the
girl, of patient dedication in the wife, of stern ability to command in
the husband and father.</p>
<p>The common German male was basically good-humored, at least in the
tavern; but he found it wise to put on a solemn front before wife,
children, competitors, and employees. He worked hard, and required the
same of those under his responsibility. He honored tradition as the well
of wisdom and the pillar of authority; old customs enabled him to meet
his daily tasks and contacts with a saving and comfortable economy of
thought. He held his religion as a sacred heritage, and was grateful for
its help in training his children to courtesy, system, and steadiness.
He repudiated the Revolution that had disordered France, and the Sturm
und Drang of German youth, as the reckless dissolution of established
relations vital to order and sanity in the home and the state. He kept
his wife and children in subordination, but he could be humane and
loving in his homely way, and he labored uncom- plainingly to meet their
needs of body and mind.</p>
<p>His wife accepted the situation without much resistance, for she
agreed that a large family in an insecure country surrounded by
potential foes called for a stern and steady hand. In the home, subject
to her husband and the law, she was accepted as the guiding authority,
and was almost always rewarded with lifelong love from her children. She
was content to be the “justified mother of children,” 9 consumed in the
conquest of the soil and the continuity of the race.</p>
<p>But there were other voices. In 1774 Theodore von Hippel,
anticipating Mary Wollstonecraft by eighteen years, published On
Marriage, a male defense of woman’s liberation. He objected to the
bride’s vow of obedience; marriage should be a partnership, not a
subjection. He demanded the full emancipation of women — not only the
vote but also eligibility to office, even the highest; he noted some
great women rulers of the age — Christina of Sweden, Catherine of
Russia, Maria Theresa of Austria. If full emancipation</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GERMAN PEOPLE 605</p>
<p>isjiot made into law the “Rights of Man” should be more honestly
called the “Rights of Men.” 10</p>
<p>Germany did not listen to him, but — under the stimulus of the French
Revolution and the spread of radical literature in Germany — the end of
the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century saw such a
flurry of emancipated women as only our time could match in number, and
only eighteenth-century France could match in brilliance, and none
surpassed in deviltry. The Romantic movement in literature, echoing
medieval trouba- dours, idealized woman no longer as a mother like
Demeter, nor as a virgin like Mary, but as an intoxicating bouquet of
physical beauty and intellectual vivacity, with a touch of scandal to
complete the lure. We have noted Hen- rietta Herz and Dorothea
Mendelssohn; add Caroline Michaelis (daughter of a Gottingen
Orientalist), who, a revolutionary widow, married August von Schlegel,
and divorced him and wed philosopher Schelling. Add The- rese Forster,
who rivaled her husband in republican ardor, left him to live with a
Saxon diplomat, and wrote, a political novel, The Seldorf Family, which
made a stir in the Rhineland; “in intellectual power,” wrote Wilhelm von
Humboldt, “she was one of the most remarkable women of her time.” 11 Add
Rachel Levin Varnhagen von Ense, whose salon was frequented by diplomats
and intellectuals in Berlin. Add Bettina von Arnim, whom we have seen
fluttering around Beethoven and Goethe. And those cultured, not</p>
<p>2 uite revolutionary, women who outshone Goethe in Weimar: the
Duchess.uise, Charlotte von Kalb, Charlotte von Stein.</p>
<p>In the larger cities of Germany this liberation of women was
naturally accompanied by a loosening of moral restraints. King Frederick
William II had set a fashion in mistresses, and in the next reign Prince
Louis Ferdi- nand outrivaled him. Love marriages were multiplying as
youngsters for- sook the charms of property for the ecstasy of romance.
Goethe, aging, looked askance from Weimar upon the gay life of the upper
echelons in Berlin, but he adopted the new morality when he took the
waters at Karls- bad. There the women displayed themselves proudly in
the new fashions that Mesdames Tallien and de Beauharnais had set in
Paris in 1 795.</p>
<p>Political immorality competed with sexual laxity. Bribery was a
favorite instrument of diplomacy, and an eager venality lubricated the
bureaucracy in Catholic and Protestant states alike. Business seems to
have been more honest than politics; the bourgeoisie, even when it
married relaxed women, kept apart from the frolics along the River
Spree. Meanwhile, however, the universities were pouring into German
life and morals the disturbing catabo- lism of partly educated
youth.</p>
<p>V. EDUCATION</p>
<p>Education now became the prime concern and achievement of Germany,
matching that interest in war which was excited by the uprising of mind
and body against Napoleon. Fichte’s Addresses to the German Nation
(1807), 12</p>
<p>6o6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXhough heard by few, expressed the growing conviction of the age:
only a reform of education at every level could lift Germany out of the
quest for pleasure into a stern devotion to the needs of the state in
these years when quick surrender and national humiliation had almost
broken the German spirit. In 1809 Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835) was
appointed Prussian education minister. He gave himself effectively to
his task, and under his lead the German educational system began a
renovation which soon made it the best in Europe. Students came from a
dozen countries to study in the Universities of Gottingen, Heidelberg,
Jena, and Berlin. Education was ex- tended to all classes, and was
broadened in subjects and aims; and though religion was emphasized as a
prop of character, the law instructors made na- tionalism the new
religion of German schools — quite as Napoleon had made it the new
divinity in the schools of France.</p>
<p>The universities of Germany required and received a vigorous examina-
tion, for many of them were suffering from the neglect that usually
befalls old age. Heidelberg’s had been founded jn 1386, Cologne’s in
1388, Erfurt’s in 1379, Leipzig’s in 1409, Rostok’s in 1419, Mainz’s in
1476, Tubingen’s in 1477, Wittenberg’s in 1502. Now they were all in
straits and need. The Un i- versity of Konigsberg, begun in 1 544, was
flourishing with Immanuel Kant. The University of Jena, established in
1558, became the cultural capital of Germany, with Schiller, Fichte,
Schelling, Hegel, the brothers Schlegel, and the poet Holderlin; there
the faculty almost rivaled the students in wel- coming the French
Revolution. The University of Halle (1604) was “the first modern
university” in three senses: it vowed itself to freedom of thought and
teaching, and required no pledge of religious orthodoxy from its
faculty; it made room for science and modern philosophy; and it be- came
a center of original scholarship and a workshop of scientific research.
13 The University of Gottingen, founded so lately as 1736, had by 1800
be- come “the greatest school in Europe,” 14 rivaled only by the
University of Leiden in Holland. “All the north of Germany,” said Mme.
de Stael, roam - ing there in 1 804, “is filled with the most learned
universities in Europe.” 15</p>
<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt, the Francis Bacon of this revival of learning,
was one of the great emancipated minds of the age. Though born in the
nobility, he described it as “once a necessary and now an unnecessary
evil.” He con - cluded from the study of history that almost every
institution, however defective and obstructive it had become, had once
been beneficent. “What</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GERMAN PEOPLE 6oj</p>
<p>fine poem endures forever.” 17 Perhaps he was thinking of Pindar,
whose poems he had translated from their exceptionally difficult
Greek.</p>
<p>He failed as a diplomat because he was too enthralled by the
revolution of ideas to absorb himself in the ephemera of politics.
Uncomfortable on the public stage, he retired to an almost solitary life
of study. He was fascinated by philology, and followed the adventures of
words as they traveled from one country to another. He had no faith in
the use of government to solve the social problem, for better laws would
be frustrated by the unchanged nature of man. He concluded that the best
hope for man lay in the develop- ment of a minority whose social
dedication might serve as a beacon for the young, even in a despondent
generation.</p>
<p>So, at the age of forty-two he came out of his privacy to serve as
minister of education; and in 1810 the government commissioned him to
organize the University of Berlin. There he effected a change that
influenced Euro- pean and American universities till our own time: the
professors were chosen not so much for their ability to teach as for
their reputation or willingness for original research in science or
scholarship. The Berlin Academy of Sci- ences (founded in 17 n), the
national observatory, botanical garden, mu- seum, and library were
incorporated into the new university. Hither came Fichte the
philosopher, Schleiermacher the theologian, Savigny the ju- rist, and
Friedrich August Wolf (1759-1824), the classical scholar whose
Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795) had startled Hellenists with the illumi-
nating suggestion that “Homer” had been not one poet but a succession of
singers gradually putting together the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the
Univer- sity of Berlin Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776-1831) gave the
lectures that became his pathfinding History of Rome ( Romische
Geschichte, 1811-32). He surprised the scholastic world by rejecting
Livy’s early chapters as not history but legend. — Henceforth in
classical scholarship, in philology, in historiography, as well as in
philosophy, Germany led the world. Its su- premacy in science had still
to come.</p>

<p>It had been retarded in Germany by its almost Siamese connection with
philosophy. Through most of this period it was regarded as a part of
philoso- phy, and was included in it, along with scholarship and
historiography, un- der the term Wissenschaftslehre, the study of
knowledge. This association with philosophy damaged science, for German
philosophy was then an exer- cise in theoretical logic soaring proudly
above research, or verification, by experiment.</p>
<p>Two men especially brought scientific honors to Germany in this age —
Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Alexander von Humboldt (1769-</p>
<p>1859). Gauss was born in a peasant cottage in Brunswick, to a
gardener- bricklayer-canal-tender father who disapproved of education as
a passport</p>

<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXo hell. 18 Karl’s mother, however, noticed his delight and skill
in numbers, and scrimped and saved to send him to school and then to
Gymnasium. There his swift progress in mathematics led his teacher to
secure an audience for him with Duke Charles William Ferdinand of
Brunswick; the Duke was impressed, and paid for the boy’s tuition for a
three -year course in the Col- legium Carolinum of Brunswick. Thence
Karl Friedrich passed to the Uni- versity of Gottingen (1795). After he
had spent a year there his mother, quite unable to understand her son’s
work and play with numbers and dia - grams, asked a teacher whether her
son gave, promise of excellence. The an- swer was, “He will be the
greatest mathematician in Europe.” 19 Before the mother died she might
have heard Laplace’s statement that G auss had al- ready verified that
prediction. He is now ranked with Archimedes and Newton. 20</p>
<p>We shall not pretend to understand, much less to expound, the
discoveries — in number theory, imaginary numbers, quadratic residues,
the method of least squares, the infinitesimal calculus — by which Gauss
transformed mathe- matics from what it had been in Newton’s time into an
almost new science, which became a tool of the scientific miracles of
our time. He himself turned his mathematics to fruition in half a dozen
fields. His observations of the orbit of Ceres (the first planetoid,
discovered on January 1, 1801) led him to formulate a new and
expeditious method of determining planetary orbits. He made researches
which placed the theory of magnetism and electricity upon a mathematical
basis. He was a burden and blessing to all scientists, who believe that
nothing is science until it can be stated in mathematical terms.</p>
<p>He was as interesting as his work. While remaking a science, he
remained a model of modesty. He was in no hurry to publish his
discoveries, so that credit for them did not come to him dll after his
death. He brought his aged mother to live with him and his family; and
in the last four of her ninety-seven years, when she was totally blind,
he served as her nurse, and allowed no one else to wait on her. 21</p>
<p>The other hero of German science in this age was Wilhelm von Hum-
boldt’s younger brother Alexander. After graduating from Gottingen he
entered the mining academy at Freiberg, and distinguished himself by his
studies of subterranean vegetation. As director of mines at Bayreuth he
dis- covered the effects of terrestrial magnetism on rock deposits,
founded a school of mines, and improved the conditions of labor. He
studied mountain formations with H.-B. de Saussure in Switzerland, and
electrical phenomena with Alessandro Volta at Pavia. In 1796 he began,
by accident, the long tour of scientific discovery (rivaling Darwin’s on
the Beagle ) whose results made him, according to a contemporary quip,
“the most famous man in Europe next to Napoleon.” 22</p>
<p>With his botanist friend Aime Bonpland, he started from Marseilles
hop- ing to join Napoleon in Egypt; circumstances deflected them to
Madrid, where the unexpected patronage of the Prime Minister encouraged
them to explore Spanish America. They sailed in 1799, and made a six-day
stop at</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GERMAN PEOPLE 609</p>
<p>Tenerife, largest of the Canary Islands; there they climbed the Peak
(12,192 feet), and witnessed a meteoric shower that led Humboldt to
study the periodicity of such phenomena. In 1800, starting from Caracas
in Venezuela, they spent four months studying the plant and animal life
of the savannas and rain forests along the Orinoco, until they reached
the common sources of both that river and the Amazon. In 1801 they
forged their way through the Andes from Cartagena (a seaport of
Colombia) to Bogota and Quito, and climbed Mount Chimborazo (18,893
feet), setting a world record that held for the next thirty-six years.
Traveling along the Pacific coast to Lima, Humboldt measured the
temperature of the ocean current that now bears his name. He observed
the transit of the planet Mercury. He made a chemi- cal study of guano,
saw its possibilities as fertilizer, and sent some of this sea-fowl
excrement to Europe for further analysis; so began one of South
America’s richest exports. The indefatigable researchers, having almost
reached Chile, turned back north, spent a year in Mexico and a short
time in the United States, and touched European soil in 1804. It was one
of the most fruitful scientific tours in history.</p>
<p>Humboldt stayed for almost three years in Berlin, studying his masses
of notes, and writing his Ansichten der Natur (1807). A year later he
moved to Paris to be near scientific records and aides; he remained
there for nine- teen years, enjoying the friendship of France’s leading
savants, and the life and literature of the salons; he was one of
Nietzsche’s “good Europeans.” He witnessed with the calm of a geologist
those superficial disturbances known as the rise and fall of states. He
accompanied Frederick William III on the visit of the victorious kings
to London in 1814, but mainly he was occupied in developing old sciences
or creating new ones.</p>
<p>He discovered ( 1 804) that the earth’s magnetic force decreases in
inten - sity from the poles to the equator. He enriched geology with his
studies of the igneous origin of certain rocks, the formation of
mountains, the geo- graphical distribution of volcanoes. He provided the
earliest clues to the laws governing atmospheric disturbances, and
thereby shed light on the origin and direction of tropical storms. He
made classic studies of air and ocean currents. He was the first (1817)
to establish for geography the iso- thermal lines uniting places with
the same mean annual temperature despite their difference in latitude;
cartographers were surprised to see, on Hum- boldt’s map, that London,
though as far north as Labrador, had the same mean temperature as
Cincinnati, which is as far south as Lisbon. His Essai sur la geographie
des plantes began the science of biogeography — the study of plant
distribution as affected by the physical conditions of the terrain.
These and a hundred other contributions, modest in appearance but of
wide and lasting influence, were published in thirty volumes from 1805
to 1834 as Voyages de Humboldt et Bonpland aux regions equinoxiales du
nouveau continent.</p>
<p>Finally, having exhausted his fortune in his work, he accepted a
salaried post as chamberlain at the Prussian court (1827). Soon after
his redomesti- cation he delivered in Berlin the public lectures which
later formed the sub-</p>
<p>6io</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXstance of his many-volumed Kosmos (1845-62), which was among the
most famous books in European ken. The preface spoke with the modesty of
a mature mind:</p>
<p>In the later evening of an active life I offer to the German public a
work whose undefined image has floated before my mind for about half a
century. I have frequently looked upon its completion as impracticable;
but as often I have been disposed to relinquish the undertaking, I have
again — though per- haps imprudently — resumed the task…. The principal
impulse by which I was directed was the earnest endeavor to comprehend
the phenomena of physical objects in their general connection, and to
represent Nature as one great whole, moved and animated by internal
force. 23.</p>
<p>As translated into English in 1849, the book ran to almost two
thousand pages, covering astronomy, geology, meteorology, and geography,
and re- vealing a physical world vivid in surprises, yet governed by the
laws of mathematics and the regularities of physics and chemistry.
Nevertheless, the general picture is one of a vast scene generated not
by an inanimate mecha- nism but by the inexhaustible vitality,
expansion, and inventiveness of in- herent life.</p>
<p>Humboldt’s own vitality was inspiring. Hardly had he settled in
Berlin when he accepted a call from Czar Nicholas I to lead a scientific
expedition into Central Asia (1829). It spent half a year gathering
meteorological data and studying mountain formation, and, on the way,
discovered diamond mines in the Urals. Back in Berlin, he used his
position as chamberlain to improve the educational system, and to help
artists and scientists. He was working on Volume V of Kosmos when death
caught up with him in his ninetieth year. Prussia gave him a state
funeral.</p>
<ol start="7" type="I">
<li>ART</li>
</ol>
<p>In Germany the age was favorable neither to science nor to art. War,
current or expected, consumed enthusiasm, emotion, and wealth. Private
patronage of art was rare and timid. Public galleries at Leipzig,
Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and especially Dresden and Berlin, were displaying
masterpieces, but Napoleon siphoned them to the Louvre.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, German art produced some memorable works amid the
turmoil. While Paris was dancing with chaos Berlin boldly raised the
Bran- denburg Gate. Karl Gotthard Langhans (1732-1808) designed it in
fluted Doric columns and grave pediment as if to announce the death of
baroque and rococo; but chiefly the stately structure proclaimed the
might of the Hohenzollerns, and their resolve that no enemy should enter
Berlin. Napo- leon entered in 1806, the Russians in 1945.</p>
<p>Sculpture fared well. It is an essentially classic art, depending on
line and (since antiquity) avoiding color; alien to its spirit were
baroque irregularity and rococo playfulness. Johann von Dannecker
chiseled a Sappho, and Catullus’ Girl with the Bird, for the Stuttgart
Museum, an Ariadne for the</p>

<p>Bethmann Museum in Frankfurt, and a famous bust of Schiller for the
library at Weimar. Johann Gottfried Schadow (1764-1850), after studying
with Canova in Rome, returned to his native Berlin and, in 1793, caught
the attention of the capital by placing, atop the Brandenburg Gate, a
carved Quadriga of four horses guided by a Winged Victory in a Roman
chariot. For Stettin he carved a marble figure of Frederick the Great
standing in martial array and burning enemies with his eyes, but with
two thick tomes at his feet to attest his work as an author; his flute
was forgotten. Tenderer is the pair of Princesses Luise and Friederike (
1 797 ) , half drowned in drap- ery but moving quietly, arm in arm, to
exaltation and grief. The Queen inspired artists by her beauty, her
passionate patriotism, and her death. Hein- rich Gentz (1766-1811)
dedicated to her a somber mausoleum at Char- lottenburg, and for that
resting place Christian Rauch (1777-1857) carved for her a tomb worthy
of her body and soul.</p>
<p>German painting was still suffering from the anemia of neoclassicism
try- ing to live on the ashes of Herculaneum and Pompeii, the treatises
of Lessing and Winckelmann, the pale faces of Mengs and David, and the
Roman reveries of Angelica Kauffmann and countless Tischbeins. But that
imported decoloration had no nourishing roots in German history or
character; Ger- man painters of this age shrugged off neoclassicism,
went back to Chris- tianity, back beyond the Reformation and its
hostility or indifference to art, and — long before the English
Pre-Raphaelites — listened to voices like Wil- helm Wackenroder and
Friedrich Schlegel calling to them to go behind Raphael to the medieval
art that had painted, carved, and composed in the simplicity and
happiness of unquestioning faith. So rose the school of paint- ers known
as the Nazarenes.</p>
<p>Its leader was Johann Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869). Born in
Liibeck, he carried with him through eighty years the sturdy seriousness
of the old merchant families, and the pervasive mists coming in from the
Baltic Sea. Sent to Vienna to study art, he found no nourishment in the
neoclassicism fed to him there. In 1809 he and his friend Franz Pforr
foun ded the “Lucan [St. Luke’s] Brotherhood,” pledged to the
revitalization of art by dedicating it to renewed faith as it had
existed in the days of Albrecht Diirer (1471-</p>
<p>1528). In 1819 they migrated to Rome, seeking to study Perugino and
other fifteenth-century painters. They were joined in 18 11 by Peter von
Cornelius (1783-1867), and later by Philipp Veit, Wilhelm von Schadow-
Godenhaus, and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld.</p>
<p>They lived like vegetarian saints in the deserted Monastery of San
Isidoro n Monte Pincio. “We led a truly monastic life,” Overbeck later
recalled. “In the morning we worked together; at midday we took turns to
cook our dinner, which was composed of nothing but soup and a pudding,
or some tasty vegetable.” They took turns in p osing for each other.
They passed by St. Peter’s as containing too much “pagan” art, and went
rather to old churches, and to the cloisters of St. John Lateran and
St. Paul’s Outside the Walls. They traveled to Orvieto to study
Signorelli, to Sienna for Duccio and Simone Martini, and above all to
Florence and Fiesole for Fra Angelico.</p>
<p>6 12</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXThey resolved to avoid portraiture, or any painting for
adornment’s sake, and to restore the pre-Raphael purpose of painting as
an encouragement of Christian piety and a patriotism bound up with the
Christian creed.</p>
<p>Their special opportunity came in 1816, when the Prussian consul in
Rome, J. S. Bartholdy, commissioned them to decorate his villa with
fres- coes on the story of Joseph and his brethren. The “Nazarenes” had
mourned the replacement of frescoes with painting on canvas with oil;
now they studied chemistry to make receptive surfaces for enduring
colors; and they so far succeeded that their frescoes, removed from Rome
and installed in the Berlin National Gallery, took rank among the
proudest possessions of the Prussian capital. But old Goethe, hearing of
these ecstasies, condemned them as imitations of fourteenth-century
Italian styles, just as the neoclassi- cists imitated pagan art. The
Nazarenes ignored that criticism, but quietly left the scene as science,
scholarship, and philosophy slowly eroded the ancient faith.</p>
<p>vm. MUSIC</p>
<p>Music was Germany’s pride in prosperity and her solace in desolation.
When Mme. de Stael reached Weimar in 1803 she found music an almost
daily part of an educated family’s life. Many cities had opera
companies, and, since Gluck, they strove to depend less and less upon
Italian works and arias. Mannheim and Leipzig had orchestras famous
throughout Europe. In- strumental music was rising to public competition
with opera. Germany had great violinists like Louis Spohr (1784-1859),
celebrated pianists like Johann Hummel (1778-1837). King Frederick
William II played the violoncello so well that he took part in quartets,
sometimes in orchestras, and Prince Louis Ferdinand was so accomplished
a pianist that only his royal descent kept him from rivaling Beethoven
and Hummel. 24</p>
<p>Germany also had a music master renowned throughout Europe as</p>
<p>eacher, composer, and virtuoso on almost any instrument: Abt (i.e.,
Abbot) Georg Joseph Vogler (1749-1814). He early won fame as organist
and pianist, learned the violin without a teacher, and developed a new
system of fingering, well adapted to his sesquipedalian fingers. Sent to
Italy to study composition with Padre Martini, he rebelled against one
teacher after an- other, took a turn to religion, was acclaimed in Rome.
Returning to Ger- many, he founded a music school in Mannheim, then in
Darmstadt, finally in Stockholm. He rejected the laborious methods of
composition taught by Italian teachers, and promised quicker perfection.
Mozart and some others thought him a charlatan, but later consideration
gave him high rank, not as composer but as teacher, performer, organ
builder, and man. He toured Eu- rope as an organist, attracting enormous
audiences, earning enormous fees, and improving organs. He transformed
the style of organ playing, and won a contest with Beethoven in
improvisation. 25 He was the honored teacher of a dozen famous pupils,
including Weber and Meyerbeer. When he died</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX)</p>
<p>THE GERMAN PEOPLE</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>hey mourned him as if they had lost a father. On May 13, 1814, Weber
wrote: “On the 6th our beloved master Vogler was suddenly snatched from
us by death He will ever live in our hearts.” 26</p>
<p>Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826) was one of the many children of
twice- married Franz Anton von Weber. Of Anton’s daughters or nieces two
have appeared in these volumes: Aloysia as Mozart’s first love and a
famous singer, and Constanze, who became Mozart’s wife. Sons Fritz and
Edmund studied with Joseph Haydn, but son Carl gave so little promise
that Fritz told him, “Carl, you may become anything else you like, but a
musician you will never be.” 27 Carl took to painting. But in Franz
Anton’s wanderings as director of a dramatic and musical troupe mostly
composed of his children, Carl’s instruction in music was resumed by a
devoted teacher, Joseph Heuschkel, under whom the boy quickly developed
a talent that astonished and rewarded his father. By 1800, aged
fourteen, Carl was composing, and giving public performances. Meanwhile,
however, the hectic hurrying from town to town had some effect upon
Carl’s character: he became restless, nervous, excitable, and changeful.
He became so fascinated by the lithogra- phy invented by his friend
Aloys Senefelder that for a time he neglected musical composition, and
went with his father to Freiberg in Saxony to undertake lithography on a
commercial scale. Then, early in 1803, he met Abt Vogler, took fire
again, became Vogler’s pupil, and accepted a r igorous routine of study
and practice. Vogler’s confidence in him spurred him on. Now he
developed so rapidly that, on Vogler’s recommendation, he was invited to
serve as Kapellmeister at Breslau ( 1 804). He was only seventeen, but
he accepted, and took his ailing father with him to the Silesian
capital.</p>
<p>The youth was not fit for a post requiring not only diverse musical
ac- complishments but skill in the handling of men and women of all
tempera- ments. He made devoted friends and dedicated enemies. He spent
too avidly, rebuked incompetence too sharply, and drank too recklessly.
Mistaking a glass of nitric acid for wine, he drank part of it before he
realized that he was imbibing fire. His throat and vocal cords were
permanently injured; he could no longer sing, he could with difficulty
speak. He lost his position after a year; he supported himself and his
father and an aunt by giving les- sons. He was near despondency when
Duke Eugen of Wiirttemberg offered all three of them rooms in his
Schloss Karlsruhe in Silesia (1806). But Napo- leon’s disruption of
Prussian territory and finances ruined the Duke, and Weber, to feed his
trio, had to forget music for a while and serve as secre- tary, at
Stuttgart, to Duke Ludwig of Wiirttemberg. This duke was a lord of
revelry, dissipation, and dishonesty, and Carl deteriorated under his
in- fluence. He developed a passionate attachment to the singer
Margarethe Lang, and lost his savings and his health in losing her. He
was rescued from debauchery by a Jewish family in Berlin — the Beers who
were the parents of Meyerbeer. Marriage sobered him, but did not restore
his health.</p>
<p>He won fame during the War of Liberation by putting to music the</p>
<p>martial songs of Karl Theodor Korner. After the war he joined in
another campaign — against Italian opera: he composed Der Freischiitz
(1821) as a</p>
<p>6 14 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXdeclaration of independence against the roving and winning
Rossini. It was first performed on June 18, 1821, the anniversary of
Waterloo; it was carried high on the wings of patriotism; never had a
German opera been so successful. It took its theme from the
Gespensterbuch ( Ghost Stories ), and frolicked with the fairies who
protected the “free - shooter”; Germany was, in those Grimm days, taking
large helpings of fairies; soon (1826) Men- delssohn would offer his
Midsummer Night’s Dream overture. Weber’s opera marked the victory of
Romanticism in German music.</p>
<p>He hoped to continue his success with Euryanthe, which had its pre-
miere in Vienna in 1823; but Rossini had just conquered Vienna, and Web-
er’s subtler music failed to charm. The failure, combined with worsening
health, so depressed him that for almost two years he ceased to compose
music. Then Charles Kemble, manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, of-
fered him a thousand pounds to write an opera for Wieland’s Oberon, and
to come to London and conduct it. Weber worked heartily on the task, and
studied English so sedulously that when he reached London he could not
only read but speak it well. At the premiere (May 28, 1825) Oberon was a
wild success, which the happy author described that same evening to his
wife:</p>
<p>I obtained this evening the greatest success of my life…. When I en-
tered the orchestra the house, crammed to the roof, burst into a frenzy
of applause. Hats and handkerchiefs were waved in the air. At the end of
the representation I was called to the stage… All went excellently;
everyone around me was happy. 28</p>
<p>But further performances were not so well received, and a concert for
Weber’s benefit, on May 26, 1826, was a sad failure. A few days later
the de - pressed and exhausted composer took to his bed, stricken with
acute tuber- culosis; and on June 5, he died, far from home and family.
The romantics die young, for in twoscore years they live their
threescore and ten.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>THE THEATER</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly every German city had a theater, for man, harassed by fact
during the day, relaxes into imagination in the evening. Some cities —
Mannheim, Hamburg, Mainz, Frankfurt, Weimar, Bonn, Leipzig, Berlin — had
resident theatrical companies; others relied on traveling troupes, and
improvised a stage for an occasional visit. The Mannheim theater had the
best reputation for performers and performances, Berlin for receipts and
salaries, Weimar for classic theatrical art.</p>
<p>Weimar in 1789 had a population of 6,200, much of it engaged in
taking care of the government and its aristocratic entourage. For a time
the towns- people supported a company of players, but by 1790 this had
died of malnu- trition. Duke Charles Augustus took over the enterprise,
made the theater part of the court, persuaded Councilor Goethe to
undertake the manage-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GERMAN PEOPLE 615</p>
<p>ment, and the courtiers to play all but the leading roles; for this
they brought in a leading man or woman from the surrounding empyrean of
floating “stars.” So the great Iffland came to Weimar, and the proud
Korona Schroter (1751-1802), whose voice and form and glancing eyes
nearly detached Goethe from Charlotte von Stein. The
poet-statesman-philosopher himself was no mean actor, now as playing the
tragic Orestes to Mile. Schroter’s Iphigenia, and then surprisingly
successful as a comic, even in farcical roles. 29 He trained the actors
to a Gallic style of speech, almost to declamation; it had the fault of
monotony, but the virtue of clarity. The Duke strongly supported this
policy, and threatened to reprove on the spot, from the ducal box, any
fault of articulation.</p>
<p>The Weimar theater undertook an ambitious repertoire, ranging from
Sophocles and Terence to Shakespeare, Calderon, Corneille, Racine, and
Voltaire, even to the contemporary dramas of Friedrich and August Wil-
helm von Schlegel, and reaching a proud triumph with Schiller’s Wallen -
stein (1798). Schiller came from Jena to live in Weimar, and, at
Goethe’s urging, became a member of the company’s managing body. Now
(1800) the little theater made Weimar the goal of thousands of
drama-loving Ger- mans. After Schiller’s death (1805) Goethe lost
interest in the theater; and when the Duke, urged on by his current
mistress, insisted on the company presenting a dramatic interlude with a
dog as star, Goethe resigned his managerial post, and the Weimar theater
disappeared from history.</p>
<p>Two actors dominated the German stage in this age. August Wilhelm
Iffland (1759-1814) paralleled the triumphs of Talma, and Ludwig
Devrient (1784-1832) repeated the career and tragedy of Edmund Kean. Bom
in Hanover, Iffland at eighteen, over parental prohibition, left home to
join a theatrical company at Gotha. Only two years later he starred at
Mannheim in Schiller’s Die Kauber. This radical period yielded to
prosperity, and to sympathy with the French emigres ; soon he became an
idol of conserva- tives. After an arduous career that covered most of
Germany, he accepted Goe the’s invitation to Weimar (1796), and pleased
his courtly audience with middle-class comedies; but he did not do well
with such tragic roles as Wallenstein or Lear. He composed several
plays, whose humor and sentiment won popular applause. In 1798 he
reached the goal of his ambi- tion — he was made manager of the National
Theater in Berlin.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death he engaged an actor, Ludwig Devrient, whb
brought to the German stage all the sentiment and tragedy of the Ro-
mantic period. His French surname was part of his Huguenot heritage. He
was the last of the three sons begotten by a Berlin draper in two
marriages. His mother died in his infancy, leaving him miserable in a
crowded home. He withdrew into a somber loneliness, consoled only by his
handsome face and raven hair. He ran away from home and school, but was
caught and returned to his father. Every attempt was made to make him a
draper, but Ludwig proved so exasperatingly incompetent that he was
released to follow his own bent. In 1 804, aged twenty, he fell in with
a theatrical troupe at Leipzig, and was given some minor part, from
which he was suddenly</p>
<p>6i6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXpropelled into a major role by the sickness of the “star.” Finding
the role of a drunken tramp congenial to his taste, he did so well that
he seemed perpetually condemned to the career of a traveling actor
loving drink on and off the boards. At last, in Breslau in 1809, he
found himself, not in Fal- staff bu t in the Karl Moor of Schiller’s
radical play. Into this part he</p>
<p>poured all that he had learned of human evil, oppression, and hate;
he let the robber chieftain take possession of him and find outlet in
every move- ment of the body, in the mobile variety of facial
expression, and the glare of angry eyes; Breslau had never seen anything
so vivid or powerful; only Edmund Kean, in that age of great actors,
could reach such heights and depths of histrionic art. All the tragic
roles were now Devrient’s for the asking. He played Lear with such total
surrender to that fragile mixture of wisdom and madness that, one night,
he collapsed in midplay, and had to be taken home, or to his favorite
tavern.</p>
<p>In 1814 Iffland, aged fifty-five, came to Breslau, acted with
Devrient, felt his force and skill, and asked him to join the National
Theater. “The only place that is worthy of you is Berlin. That place — I
feel it too well — will soon be vacant. It is res erved for you.” 30 In
September Iflland died; in the following spring Devrient took his place.
There he played himself out, living on fame and wine, spending happy
hours exchanging tales with E. T. A. Hoffmann at a tavern near the
theater. In 1828, victim of his renown, he accepted a challenge to play
in Vienna. He returned to Berlin a nervous ruin. He died on December 30,
1832, aged forty-eight. Three gifted nephews, all bearing his name,
carried on his art to the end of the century.</p>
<p>X. THE DRAMATISTS</p>
<p>After August Wilhelm von Schlegel’s masterly translation of
Shakespeare</p>
<p>Bom (1777) in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, he was near-Slav in temperament
as well as in geography. Like a good German he spent seven years in the
Army, but later mourned those years as wasted. He studied science,
litera- ture, and philosophy in the local university, and lost his faith
in both re- ligion and science. He propos ed to a general’s daughter,
but he shuddered at the thought of marriage. He fled to Paris and then
Switzerland, where he played with the fancy of buying a farm and letting
the discipline of the seasons calm the instability of a mind dizzied
with ideas. Relapsing into</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE GERMAN PEOPLE 6lJ</p>
<p>literature, he wrote, but never finished, an historical tragedy,
Robert Guis- kard; and in 1808 he staged at Weimar a comedy, Der
zerbrochene Krug ( The Broken Pitcher), which a later generation ranked
as a lasting classic. Staying in Weimar for a while (1802-03), he won
friendly encouragement from the kindly old agnostic Christoph Wieland,
who, after hearing bits of Guiskard, told the young dramatist that he
held in him the “spirits of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Shakespeare,” 31
and that the genius of Kleist was destined “to fill the gap, in the
development of the German drama, which even Schiller and Goethe had not
yet filled.” 32 This was enough to destroy the twenty-five-year-old
Sophocles.</p>
<p>He went to live in Paris, felt its fever, and pondered hopelessly
over the skepticism inherent in German idealist philosophy: if we know
only so little of the world as comes to our consciousness after being
transformed by our modes of perception, then we can never find the
truth. Only one thing is certain: philosophers, scientists, poets,
saints, beggars, lunatics, all are fated soon to be dust, or a memory
fading in a mortal few. Kleist lost the courage to face, accept, and
enjoy reality even as so precariously known. He concluded that his
genius was a delusion, that his books and manuscripts were vanities. In
a moment of wrath and despair he burned such manu- scripts as he had
with him, and tried to enlist in the army that Napoleon was gathering at
the Channel. On October 26, 1803, he wrote to his sister, whom perhaps
he loved beyond taboo:</p>
<p>What I am going to tell you may cost you your life; but I must, I
must do it. I have perused again, rejected, and burned my work; and now
the end has come. Heaven denies me fame, the greatest of earthly goods;
like a capricious child I throw down before it all the rest. I cannot
show myself worthy of thy friendship, and without thy friendship I
cannot live; I choose death. Be calm, exalted one! I shall die the
beautiful death of battle. I have left the capital of this country, I
have wandered to its northern coast, I shall enter the French service;
soon the army will embark for England; the ruin of us all is lurking
over the sea. I exult in the prospect of the glorious grave. Thou,
beloved, shalt be my last thought. 33</p>
<p>His plan to be a German soldier in the French Army aroused suspicion.
He was expelled from France at the insistence of the Prussian
ambassador. Shortly thereafter France declared war on Prussia; in 1806
Napoleon de- stroyed the Prussian Army, almost the Prussian state.
Kleist sought refuge in Dresden, but French soldiers arrested him there
as a suspected spy; he spent six months in jail. Returning to Dresden,
he joined a patriotic group of writers and artists, and collaborated
with Adam Muller in editing a periodical to which he contributed some of
his finest essays.</p>
<p>In 1808 he published a tragic drama, Penthesilea. Its heroine is an
Ama- zonian queen who, after Hector’s death, comes to join the desperate
Tro - jans against the Greeks at Troy; she sets out to kill Achilles, is
vanquished by him, falls in love with him, and then (following the law
of the Ama- zonian women that each of them must prove herself by
overcoming her lover in batde) pierces Achilles with an arrow, sets her
dogs upon him,</p>

<p>XXXjoins them in tearing him to pieces, drinks his blood, and
collapses in death. The play is an echo of the Bacchic frenzy which
Euripides had told of in The Bacchae — a. side of the Greek mythology
and character not empha- sized by Hellenists before Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Doubtless the anger aroused by Napoleon’s ruthless dismemberment of
Prussia had raised the poet out of his own woes to make him one of the
voices calling Germany to the War of Liberation. Toward the end of 1808
he issued a play, Die Hermannsschlacht, which, by telling of Arminius’
victories over the Roman legions of a.d. 6, sought to rouse the courage
of the Germans in the apparently hopeless conflict with Napoleon. Here
again the fervor of Kleist’s patriotism raised him to neurotic excesses:
Hermann’s</p>
<p>The years 1809- 10 were the apex of Kleist’s genius. His poetic drama
Das Keith chen von Heilbronn was staged to success in Hamburg, Vienna,
and Graz; and the two volumes of short stories that he issued in 1810
marked him out as perhaps the finest prose stylist of the age of Goethe.
Thereafter his spirit failed, perhaps through the breakdown of his
health. Some strange affinity of suffering brought him into association,
finally into a love romance, with an incurably sick woman, Henriette
Vogel. His letters to her reveal a mind on the edge of sanity. “My
Jette, my all, my castle, meadows, sum of my life, my wedding, baptism
of my children, my tragedy, my fame, my guardian angel, my cherub and
seraph!” She answered that if he loved her he would kill her. On
November 21, 181 1, on the banks of the Wansee, near Potsdam, he shot
her fatally, and then himself.</p>
<p>In him the Romantic surrender to feeling reached its highest point in
uncontrolled intensity, in power of imagination, and in brilliance of
style. He seems at rimes to have been more French than German, antipodal
to Goethe and brother to Baudelaire, or rather to Rimbaud. He almost
justified Goethe’s unsympathetic judgment: “The classic is healthy, the
romantic is sickly.” Let us see.</p>
